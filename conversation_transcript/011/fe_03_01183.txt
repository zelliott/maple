0.21 1.64 A: hello 

0.71 4.77 B: [noise] hi my name's laine i'm in san francisco california 

4.48 7.32 A: hi i'm tracy i'm in galena illinois 

7.17 8.37 B: (( hi tracy )) 

7.79 8.82 A: hi 

9.78 11.67 A: is this your first time doing this 

11.56 13.38 B: um this is my third call 

12.88 15.43 A: oh great okay this is my first time 

15.32 17.82 B: oh great [laughter] 

16.48 22.46 A: [laughter] so a million dollars but you can't speak to your best friend ever again 

22.15 23.58 B: (( [noise] right )) 

23.82 32.69 A: um hm that's pretty tough because for me i would probably say that my best friend is my husband 

32.08 33.02 B: mhm 

32.92 36.76 A: so that would mean there's no way i could take the million dollars 

36.46 37.56 B: mhm 

37.59 40.55 A: unless i could say that my best friend was 

40.88 44.00 A: um that my husband didn't qualify for that 

43.73 44.69 B: right 

44.80 47.53 A: in which case maybe i would take the million dollars 

48.31 50.78 B: so who'd be your best friend if it wasn't your husband [noise] 

50.77 60.09 A: um that would be my friend karen who i've known since high school but we live pretty far apart now we do see each other fairly regularly but 

60.26 63.61 A: i don't know a million dollars might improve my life quite a bit 

63.57 64.69 B: mhm 

64.06 65.26 A: what about you 

65.53 67.18 B: well um 

67.79 69.14 B: (( [sigh] )) 

69.54 70.84 B: thinking about that 

70.48 71.60 A: [laughter] 

71.09 73.87 B: a million dollars best friend hm 

74.16 76.45 B: um [sigh] 

76.59 82.31 B: i don't know i've had a lot of friends come and go out of my life in the last years and um 

84.45 95.22 B: i think that even though it's sort of an abstract question about friendship and money i'd take the million dollars because i have a lot of friends [laughter] and i [laughter] i'd take the million dollars 

91.14 92.50 A: [laughter] 

94.07 96.22 A: uh-huh you could afford to lose one 

96.04 100.61 B: i could i i could maybe i think i could lose even a best friend for a million dollars 

99.56 103.75 A: [laughter] it sounds terrible but it's probably true 

104.03 107.80 B: well i- it's such an unrealistic question in the first place 

107.29 109.74 A: right right yeah i don't know 

107.90 110.89 B: (( [laughter] so i'll take the million dollars [laughter] )) 

110.23 117.76 A: r- yeah yeah if if i don't have to really tell my best friend that i ever did that [laughter] right but yeah but i- you know 

114.66 116.14 B: right exactly 

118.88 123.17 A: i don't know it's still kinda hard because it depends on whether 

123.32 126.17 A: if we're saying my true best friend is my husband 

125.74 126.81 B: mhm 

126.96 130.88 B: right and your husband isn't worth giving up your husband isn't worth a million dollars [laughter] [laughter] 

127.09 128.60 A: and 

130.04 141.17 A: [noise] no [laughter] plus he's sitting right here and uh [laughter] but um yeah no i definitely wouldn't give him up for a million dollars but 

140.74 143.77 B: yeah and i guess the difference for me is just that i don't 

143.83 152.02 B: um have a particular lifelong best friend my my best friends kind of shift as i change jobs and i move around and 

147.89 149.08 A: uh-huh 

151.41 153.29 A: right right 

152.18 165.87 B: um i'm not married and so for me the whole concept of you know having a million dollars and starting over again i mean for a million dollars i'd even relocate [laughter] say sure give me a million dollars put me somewhere else i don't care 

161.26 162.53 A: (( right )) 

164.41 167.37 A: and you can find a whole new set of friends [laughter] 

166.59 173.92 B: that's exactly right you know that's a good idea hey maybe that's what this study is actually about maybe they're just figuring out who they're going to give their million dollars to 

168.88 169.92 A: [laughter] 

173.03 181.30 A: right that would be great [laughter] right but um so what would you do with your million dollars 

174.86 176.31 B: [laughter] 

180.63 184.75 B: what would i do with my million dollars um 

184.79 193.29 B: well i'm pretty conservative i think what i'd do is i'd um invest about half and then take about a quarter and um 

194.45 196.57 B: invest in 

197.08 204.75 B: projects and charity and then the other quarter i'd probably blow on travel 'cause that's what i really like to do 

199.97 201.23 A: mhm 

204.12 213.44 A: oh me too i i think i would if i had a lot of money um a lot of disposable money it would go for travel definitely 

208.06 208.92 B: mhm 

210.05 210.93 B: mhm 

211.78 213.77 B: mhm where have you been 

213.51 220.46 A: um we actually just got back from a little weekend trip um we went to las vegas we had never been there 

217.23 218.37 B: mhm 

219.02 219.92 B: mhm 

219.99 221.43 B: mhm what'd you think 

221.09 222.03 A: um 

222.16 227.67 A: we thought that it was really fun for the three days we were there but that we wouldn't want to stay much longer 

227.32 228.19 B: (( mhm )) 

228.66 229.63 A: we 

228.68 241.74 B: i got trapped there once for a week and a half my car broke down and i completely agree with you las vegas is a lot of fun for three days and it's just misery to be trapped there for longer than you want to be 

232.73 234.23 A: oh my gosh 

240.18 247.49 A: i would imagine right i mean once the novelty kind of wears off it's it's strange now we did spend one day 

247.66 256.78 A: going out into the desert and and that was fun so i suppose you know if if you're gonna incorporate longer desert trips in you could spend the time there but 

249.71 250.61 B: (( mhm )) 

256.66 258.40 B: did you go up to the valley of fire 

258.21 260.98 A: no we went to red rock canyon 

260.67 264.07 B: oh it's beautiful there i love red rock 

263.14 266.83 A: yeah it was it was very nice and we went hiking 

266.66 267.36 B: (( mhm )) 

266.99 278.88 A: so that was fun but um yeah as far as big expensive million dollar type trips um haven't done i'm trying to think we mostly pack up the kids in the car and drive 

272.03 273.12 B: mhm 

277.54 278.50 B: mhm 

279.16 280.25 B: mhm 

279.72 287.20 A: um long distances and we like to explore so that's what we do my husband's a schoolteacher so we can take the time in the summer 

285.11 286.24 B: mhm 

287.18 288.78 B: oh that's really nice 

288.56 294.04 A: but we have the time we just don't have a lot of money so that's where the million dollars would be good 

291.47 292.36 B: (( mm )) 

293.45 301.08 B: mhm well it's funny living here in san francisco a million dollars just doesn't seem like very much a million dollars could put me in kind of a normal house 

297.34 299.16 A: well that's true 

300.74 302.72 A: right [laughter] 

301.48 303.37 B: [laughter] 

302.97 308.54 A: yeah well where i am it's a small town about three hours west of chicago 

308.51 312.13 B: you know the funny thing is you're the second person i've spoken to from illinois 

311.88 313.79 A: oh really mm 

312.93 317.46 B: yeah somehow the study managed to tap into a whole bunch of people in illinois h- 

317.10 318.93 A: huh that's interesting 

318.59 320.13 B: how'd you hear about it 

319.57 334.55 A: i heard about it on um an internet list that i've been on um it's for parents who had babies in january of nineteen ninety seven which i did and it's a group of mums who have been there's about thirty twenty five of us who have been on this list 

328.13 329.90 B: mhm mhm 

334.30 335.31 B: mhm 

334.49 337.62 A: for over six years now and one of the 

336.20 337.23 B: mhm 

338.02 345.58 A: one of them got it so i think probably three or four more people signed up but it's an international list so not based in illinois at all 

343.62 344.77 B: mhm 

345.55 346.23 B: mhm 

347.10 356.50 A: but so that was interesting to to do it and this is the first we came home from this vacation and there was something like twenty messages on the answering machine from the study 

349.36 350.06 B: (( [mn] )) 

353.71 354.98 B: mhm 

356.40 357.53 B: right 

357.33 358.16 A: so 

358.52 363.60 B: yeah i've had three calls today but you're the first one that's connected i've been on hold for 

363.71 369.52 B: ten or fifteen minutes each time and got tired of waiting i think that the the 

365.48 366.82 A: oh 

370.47 376.29 B: it's sort of a slack time of the day in illinois you're just home for the evening aren't you it's about five there 

372.78 373.85 A: uh-huh 

376.03 377.99 A: it's right five o'clock 

378.49 383.00 A: so y- yeah it would be an odd time people are probably traveling and so forth 

382.90 384.37 B: yeah 

383.57 385.91 A: from work but 

385.17 385.99 B: (( yeah )) 

386.26 388.76 A: so are we supposed to talk for ten minutes 

388.54 390.50 B: [mn] um um i 

388.98 391.39 A: or do we just talk until we're done 

391.09 404.00 B: well i've never made it through ten minutes each time we've run out of things to say [laughter] before we get to the end of ten minutes and so i've never waited ten minutes to see if the system comes back on and says you're done or whatever 

395.43 396.76 A: yeah [laughter] 

397.02 398.25 A: [laughter] 

402.90 404.15 A: (( oh okay )) 

404.00 414.77 B: so um [laughter] we can hang in there a few more minutes if you like and see it might be kind of interesting i've been timing it this time we've been on the phone for five minutes so if we can make so we can make it in 

410.60 411.81 A: (( oh okay )) 

412.26 415.21 A: oh so we have [laughter] 

414.84 420.11 B: we could we could make it another five minutes i could find out whether the system actually tells you if you're done or not 

419.18 422.43 A: do you know if it's crucial that we stay on topic 

422.58 430.23 B: um i think when i read the original e- posting on the website it said you don't have to stay on topic you can they just want us to talk 

429.43 430.52 A: okay 

430.27 433.61 B: so i think it's some kind of a language study about 

434.15 437.56 B: communication between people who don't know each other that kind of thing 

436.79 439.50 A: and maybe how off-topic we get but 

439.04 443.87 B: [laughter] and we're pretty off-topic we're meta topic now 

439.70 441.56 A: [laughter] 

441.95 442.96 A: yeah 

444.48 445.33 A: (( yes )) 

444.56 449.11 B: yes a million dollars what would i do more specifically with a million dollars um 

447.86 450.05 A: if you could if you could take 

449.95 450.81 B: mhm 

450.12 457.82 A: five hundred thousand of it and take one trip you have to spend five hundred thousand and you have three months to spend it 

451.87 452.57 B: (( mhm )) 

454.74 456.03 B: on one trip 

457.28 459.91 B: oh my goodness three months that's not very long 

459.98 461.65 B: um i think 

462.45 473.93 B: i would well 'cause i'm currently thinking about taking a trip to italy i've got italy on the brain so probably what i would do is i would rent a really good villa in tuscany 

468.25 469.63 A: (( oh )) 

473.96 475.93 A: oh wouldn't that be amazing 

475.57 489.39 B: and then i would basically just um staff it with um florists and and cooks and then i would um 

486.14 487.15 A: (( [laughter] )) 

489.70 496.28 B: b- buy all my friends tickets [laughter] and then we would just have an astounding 

491.98 493.74 A: [laughter] 

496.36 497.85 B: (( tuscan )) 

497.99 500.25 B: (( bacchanalia [laughter] )) 

498.12 505.98 A: [laughter] isn't there a movie that's exactly that it's something like uh eight or six women in a villa in italy 

505.82 507.39 B: i haven't seen it 

507.03 515.53 A: i'm trying to think what it would have been called it's and it's set maybe a hundred years ago i think but uh you need to find that movie maybe [laughter] 

509.03 510.02 B: mhm 

511.41 512.43 B: mhm 

514.61 518.81 B: yeah well i think i could probably spend half a million dollars on that pretty easily 

518.20 522.01 A: yeah probably yeah now for me um 

522.25 533.27 A: that would be nice i think i would aim i i'd like to try and go to very exotic maybe hard to reach destinations like say pitcairn island 

529.58 531.37 B: yeah like um 

533.12 534.66 B: (( i don't even know where that is )) 

534.01 535.89 A: that's where um 

536.02 539.07 A: the you know the mutiny on the bounty 

539.49 547.17 A: um the the ship and then they the mutineers went to an island in the south pacific 

541.13 542.08 B: uh-huh 

546.87 547.84 B: mhm 

547.21 554.57 A: and lived there and star- and all the people who live on this small pitcairn island are the descendants of 

554.65 558.81 A: the bounty mutineers and local women there 

558.92 559.96 B: wow 

559.41 568.16 A: and uh you know to get there it's one of those places kind of like easter island where you need to take many many flights and there's one flight a week kind of thing 

563.43 564.43 B: mhm 

568.46 573.52 A: uh but that seems very interesting those kind of far away places 

570.82 571.81 B: mhm 

573.46 575.09 B: mm would you take your family 

573.69 575.95 A: that just take a lot of money to get to 

576.17 578.13 B: would you take your family or would you go alone 

577.82 586.50 A: i would take my family yeah my kids even though my youngest is six but they're they're big travelers they're great in the car they're great on 

579.27 580.21 B: mhm 

582.58 583.47 B: mhm 

586.78 593.81 A: flights and things so yeah i would definitely take them although it's nice to do a little thing like we did this weekend and go without 

588.32 589.23 B: mhm 

593.87 595.02 B: mhm 

594.33 597.08 A: as well um it's a good break 

597.03 598.23 B: mhm 

598.30 599.17 A: (( but ))
