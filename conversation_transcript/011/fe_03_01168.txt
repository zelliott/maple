229.51 230.57 A: (( [laughter] )) 

230.09 233.08 B: you'd think they'd come on and give us some instructions or something wouldn't you 

233.39 237.60 A: i would think hey do you just like talk and then they tell you when to stop or what 

237.26 238.22 B: (( [laughter] ))

248.49 250.63 B: oh oh [laughter] 

249.90 253.93 A: okay [laughter] so let's see what else would you change 'cause they 

250.85 251.68 B: i 

252.82 256.16 B: well let's see talk about that then well let's see 

254.94 256.52 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

257.81 259.20 B: well 

257.91 258.89 A: um 

261.93 270.05 B: probably another thing that i would change with my life was that when i got out of high school i decided instead of going to college i thought oh boy you know i don't need to do that 

270.12 275.21 B: and ah we were going to a group of us were going to travel to ah new york 

274.95 275.81 A: uh-huh 

276.48 279.99 B: well that kind of went by the wayside 

280.19 283.68 B: and ah i always wondered what would happen had we gone 

283.34 284.42 A: [mn] had you gone 

284.46 290.30 B: yes had we gone there and would we have stayed or would we have come back home or what would we have done 

290.17 291.24 A: mhm 

290.83 293.39 B: (( you know there was about four of us that were going to go )) 

293.67 294.87 A: yeah 

294.82 296.24 B: that didn't work out 

297.62 301.89 A: isn't it sad going no i really wish i would have done this 

301.13 307.80 B: [laughter] or or or what if you know what if i would have turned that corner instead of this corner 

302.08 303.17 A: (( you know )) 

304.44 305.53 A: yeah 

307.60 321.55 A: yeah and everything would be different [mn] 'cause you can trace everything back like you met a certain person because you went to you know this event and you only went to that event because you met this other person and blah blah blah blah blah 

308.30 309.20 B: (( you know )) 

321.34 322.40 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

321.69 325.07 A: and it all goes back and the smallest little thing could change everything 

324.97 328.89 B: that's true what do they say life turns on a dime 

328.53 329.76 A: yeah 

329.18 330.55 B: mhm mhm 

329.81 331.18 A: it's kind of creepy 

331.84 335.59 B: it really is when you think about it it really is [laughter] 

332.82 333.89 A: [laughter] 

336.84 338.58 A: yeah let's see what else would i change 

339.30 341.91 A: i know i would have been nicer to my mother 

341.88 342.48 B: (( [laughter] )) 

343.06 346.52 A: actually both my parents i was a brat when i was a teenager 

347.00 348.73 A: and i think everyone is 

348.51 349.84 B: absolutely 

349.53 353.25 A: but it was awful when i saw my little sister going through it 

353.11 353.92 B: uh-huh 

353.43 359.06 A: and 'cause you know you go through that phase where you love your parents and then you hate your parents and then when you're older you love them again 

358.72 359.46 B: yeah 

359.90 365.19 A: so i was back into like loving my parents and i was watching my sister be you know 

365.22 374.58 A: the little devil and hate them and it was awful 'cause ah she was exactly like me in every way and what an awful person i had been for like years 

374.35 375.93 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

375.31 378.08 A: it was really depressing and i feel really guilty 

378.57 381.05 A: but i don't really know how to tell my parents 

381.17 383.93 A: [laughter] sorry for being a brat [laughter] didn't mean to 

383.76 385.35 B: just just tell 'em [laughter] 

385.11 386.76 A: yeah 

385.99 389.12 B: sometimes it's just easier that way just 

388.42 389.46 A: mhm 

389.19 391.14 B: to blurt it out and tell them 

391.53 392.90 A: (( exactly mm )) 

395.35 397.37 A: what else would i change 

398.50 399.06 B: (( [laughter] )) 

399.31 401.33 A: mm i would like to have gone places 

401.58 402.63 B: traveled 

401.63 403.11 A: and traveled hi 

404.55 405.92 A: (( kitty 'cause )) 

406.09 407.97 A: i've never been anywhere 

408.07 412.27 B: well like you're still it sounds like you're still young enough that you can go do that 

411.69 415.03 A: yeah just need some money 

415.96 420.27 A: but now it's so scary going anywhere because now apparently we're in like the war 

419.88 421.22 B: this is true 

421.11 423.36 A: or we're going to be whatever 

422.98 425.27 B: very soon it sounds like uh-huh 

424.92 426.93 A: yeah and so 

427.27 430.30 A: it's not exactly the best time to go travel the 

430.31 431.41 A: world 

431.33 435.37 B: no but [mn] you know even within the united states would be okay 

435.16 436.75 A: yeah 

437.08 438.78 A: just to go somewhere 

439.70 441.52 A: get out of walnut creek 

441.08 445.94 B: [laughter] there are other places than walnut creek yes that's true 

445.60 448.98 A: yeah although this is very nice here 

446.84 447.74 B: there is a 

448.36 451.36 B: it is it's a very nice place 

449.34 451.05 A: (( i don't regret moving here )) 

451.13 453.12 A: (( it's a lot nicer than brockley )) 

453.51 454.61 B: that's true 

453.68 457.35 A: like the apartment that i live in now is five hundred dollars cheaper 

457.52 461.60 A: and is so much nicer it's not even funny 

461.63 465.42 A: because the places in brockley they're just run by like [mn] 

461.87 463.16 B: oh really 

465.46 466.89 B: oh yeah yeah 

466.23 468.36 A: they don't repair anything 

468.51 482.12 A: they don't i mean they're so many safety hazards it's not even funny but if we're close to campus then they can charge you know fifteen hundred dollars for a one bedroom apartment and people will pay it and they'll just put you know three people in it just to make it affordable 

480.18 485.52 B: well and you know the closer you get to san francisco the higher everything is 

485.46 486.65 A: yeah 

486.34 489.71 B: the rents go up and everything else and everything goes 

488.84 489.46 A: (( mm )) 

489.89 498.01 B: up but as you get further away then the well i don't even know if that's true anymore though because rents are high everywhere 

497.81 499.16 A: (( uh-huh )) 

499.50 502.13 A: yeah i went looking because if i got 

502.45 507.21 A: (( a job that i just applied for then i'm going to have to move probably like menlo park area it's so expensive )) 

506.52 507.33 B: uh-huh 

508.73 509.65 B: yes 

509.78 513.97 A: oh my god i can't even imagine coming up with that kind of money 

509.78 510.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

514.65 519.95 A: [mn] i'm salary so i shouldn't have a problem but 

520.37 521.69 A: (( [sigh] it's ridiculous )) 

521.69 522.28 B: (( [laughter] )) 

522.70 524.69 B: it's kind of scary to get out there 

524.76 534.08 A: yeah i thought i was ready for it and now it's like you know talking about relocating and negotiating my benefits i'm like i'm not ready for this 

533.71 535.94 B: [laughter] 

535.33 536.78 A: not at all 

536.82 540.16 A: i'll just keep you know waitressing and bartending for a while 

539.08 542.71 B: well now see this could turn your whole future around too 

542.54 543.86 A: (( yeah yeah it )) 

546.04 548.27 B: take a chance go do something 

548.46 549.45 A: (( will yeah )) 

550.62 554.48 A: (( kind of just want to stay in school forever i'm good at it so )) 

556.32 557.85 A: (( it's easy you know )) 

557.69 559.02 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

562.53 566.21 A: [noise] [sigh] but anyway did you grow up in concorde 

565.82 569.02 B: ah actually no i grew up over in the south bay 

569.08 570.12 A: oh really 

569.83 571.53 B: ah yeah mountain view 

571.90 573.30 B: menlo park 

572.83 574.59 A: (( memo park [laughter] oh funny ))

585.04 586.86 A: and i miss it very much 

586.79 588.55 B: mhm 

587.70 591.25 A: 'cause it was warm you could go to the beach like on christmas 

591.44 593.65 A: (( because it's still warm enough to go to the beach )) 

595.95 596.77 A: (( [mn] )) 

597.80 599.95 B: well let's see what else would you change other
