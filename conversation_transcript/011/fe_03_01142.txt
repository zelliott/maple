4.41 9.29 A: hello mike my name is also mike and i'm from um probo utah 

9.43 14.81 B: okay well that you know in any group of five people there'll have to be at least two mikes so 

14.19 16.86 A: [laughter] pretty common name and 

16.20 21.75 B: [laughter] so i think if i could go back in time i would want to have a different name something a little less common 

22.07 23.52 A: (( why's that )) 

22.94 30.40 B: ah well you know there's just too many mikes so i end up getting called by my last name a lot which is you know okay but ah 

30.66 35.60 B: it'd be nice to have something a little more ah a little more distinctive you know 

35.62 40.31 B: maybe ah flash or ah you know ah 

40.93 45.36 B: schwarzenegger or something else like that you know a- a- a- a little more zip to it 

44.83 46.95 A: a little more maybe less common 

46.68 48.62 B: yeah maybe a little less common 

48.92 53.02 A: so if you had to pick one name exactly um which of those names do you like the best 

52.96 54.22 B: (( ah )) 

54.51 65.39 B: you know i don't really know that's a that's a funny thing ah let's see maybe i'll i'll think of something by the time we get to the end i'll a- i- i'll give you a turn right now maybe i'll think of another name 

63.75 64.50 A: okay 

64.91 69.51 A: um what would i change well i kinda like my name so i would keep my name 

69.17 70.11 B: okay 

69.79 75.90 A: i might have been um if i could go back and change something maybe more active in my youth um 

75.98 77.36 A: more um 

77.95 86.80 A: um especially outgoing i er i was more socially outgoing later on um as i got into um end of highschool and college but i would have been more 

86.73 98.16 A: more active um with groups maybe i when i was younger i think um what i know now if i could've applied it then um i could have had a lot more um maybe a lot more experiences 

99.59 105.37 B: yeah i kinda feel the same way like it it took me a long time to get any social skills whatsoever 

106.05 113.97 B: ah well maybe not that bad but yeah i was really quiet and intro- introverted when i was a kid 

113.66 116.65 A: so yeah that's i think that's what i'd change the most 'cause 

116.66 121.68 A: um being an introver- i mean i wouldn't consider myself an in- introvert by any means now 

121.67 133.06 A: but i was more when i was younger and i think being more extroverted i could i would have had a lot more funny probably [laughter] maybe not so much academic but a little bit more more excitement i think 

127.61 128.60 B: yeah 

133.66 135.24 B: yeah 

135.37 143.56 B: let's see what else would i have done differently i don't think i would have done that many things differently if i would have gone back in time i think i would have ah i 

144.06 152.89 B: think i would have tried harder to get on the highschool basketball team but ah yeah it wouldn't have made any difference longterm anyway i still would have been a bad basketball player 

152.41 154.55 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

154.95 166.00 A: if i'm going to go towards um sport i played nine years of baseball and blew out my knees and i gave up baseball instead of having my knees redone and giving it one more try 

165.83 166.59 B: uh-huh 

166.09 167.76 A: um i'd been um 

167.77 169.99 A: looking at the costume in town 

170.03 181.15 A: and had a great coach and i didn't want to push it any more with my bad knees and probably i would have ah changed things maybe not played catcher for so many years and tried a different position so i didn't blow out my knees 

180.76 181.78 B: mhm 

181.28 188.66 A: maybe i still would have been pretty small in size compared to a lot of the ball players but to have tried to live that dream would have been great 

188.36 197.07 B: mhm yeah that's the other thing they got a- you know the knee surgery is a lot better now than it was ah you know certainly when i grew up 

197.54 201.31 B: ah so i guess they can repair them a lot better now too 

201.08 203.61 A: yeah they don't have to make such big cuts on your knee 

203.46 210.45 B: yeah my nephew had knee surgery i don't know exactly what he had he had some sort of meniscus problem and ah 

210.83 219.64 B: you know he went in there was outpatient they did a little laproscopic thing and he was shoveling snow the next day although i don't know that that was such a good idea 

219.18 219.92 A: (( oh )) 

219.83 221.07 B: (( but ah )) 

221.25 223.65 B: you know it's really amazing what they can do now 

224.33 225.28 B: (( you know it use )) 

224.51 225.28 A: (( no )) 

225.56 227.65 A: if you could change anything else what would you do 

228.11 229.35 B: (( ah )) 

230.10 234.28 B: you know i think if i could change something else i think i would have taken more math 

234.28 235.04 A: (( [laughter] mm )) 

235.40 240.66 B: ah you know i make a living as a statistician now but it's kinda funny 'cause i don't really ah 

240.93 247.41 B: you know while i'm a professional statistician and belong to the you know the organizations i didn't really take that much maths in college 

247.45 257.98 B: um i was n- but nobody ever asked about that and you know i always ah i have people who do the integrations and that you know the hard stuff for me i just kinda pretend ah you know 

259.06 271.27 B: well yeah i used to know how to do that stuff but actually i never did but um so you know that's funny of course i tell my daughters that and they just laugh no you don't really want more math dad you're just making that up 

271.34 273.84 A: i think a lot of people try to avoid maths [laughter] 

273.66 278.98 B: yeah but ah yeah a a a little more would have come in handy 

279.23 280.23 B: so 

280.40 285.88 B: yeah i think i think i would have done that but ah you know i don't have a lot of regrets 

286.46 287.76 B: ah 

288.53 299.69 B: you know there's a a girlfriend or two who i think i wouldn't have broken up with but probably would've broken up with them anyway or or if not you know it turned out okay um you know 

299.97 307.36 B: been married twenty seven years to the same woman and you know that- that's just fine but you know there there are things that you regret along that line 

303.96 305.51 A: (( that's great congratulations )) 

308.66 309.69 B: um 

310.90 313.89 B: so i wish i'd done more travelling

344.20 350.18 B: well maybe not never you know there- there's a you gotta you know there's decades to live ahead so 

350.47 352.76 B: you know italy will probably still be there

354.23 359.90 A: [laughter] who knows who knows we will be in the in the even in the far future

400.18 413.97 A: and now that i look at it i wish i'd read a lot more of the great classics it would make my conversations with her a little bit deeper and i feel a lot of time my conversations are superficial ah my knowledge of the the good classics ideal is in the end 

403.98 404.77 B: uh-huh 

414.19 418.59 A: dante's works all those those those great books of literature 

418.66 422.73 A: and now i'm having to catch up real fast just so that i 

422.66 435.39 A: can um carry on um meaningful conversations in her discipline and i wish that i had just had more interest in that so that i would've come out across as less sports which i wouldn't give up so but i wish would've 

427.35 428.15 B: uh-huh 

433.56 434.36 B: yeah 

435.49 438.80 A: spent a little more time paying attention to the those literature

442.27 443.52 B: (( 'cause ah )) 

443.54 449.26 B: i ah oh one year i didn't have much to do one summer 'cause i couldn't find a good job for a while 

449.42 452.67 B: this was when i was in highschool so i got a college reading list 

453.03 465.37 B: and i didn't know that nobody ever read those things ahead of time they just passed out the list and said you should read these in highschool i didn't know nobody ever did that so in ah one summer i read like sixty

477.46 478.94 B: (( you know ah a )) 

479.07 490.33 B: whole bunch of nineteenth century british literature the problem is that you know when you read those things at the rate of like one a day practically eventually they all kind've blend together 

490.61 497.08 B: especially with all the british ones from the nineteenth century there's a there's like a british group and i can't remember what happens in what book 

497.34 508.75 B: and then there's a whole bunch of the russian things like i get dead souls and ah crime and punishment and brothers karimov all kinda you know blended in i kinda forget what happened in what book 

509.23 510.81 A: (( [laughter] understanding [laughter] )) 

509.30 510.05 B: so 

510.64 514.05 B: so there- there's down sides to reading some of those too 

514.23 515.84 A: that reminds me of um 

515.92 524.33 A: um i had to take um a graduate exam um in an area that wasn't my speciality and it was on peninsula literature 

524.44 538.80 A: and i'd never had it taught to me but they wanted to know that i had the the brunt of that domain so i had assigned to me um one millenium of literature from from the um peninsula of spain 

530.33 531.16 B: uh-huh 

538.57 539.37 B: uh-huh 

538.92 543.58 A: and i didn't have very much background in in um spanish literature at all 

543.69 548.35 A: and i got through it i read it all i read everything that they wanted all the major works 

548.54 553.04 A: in the two month period and i took the test passed it can't remember any of it now 

552.60 553.93 B: [laughter] 

553.42 558.36 A: and um i don't know if i really enjoyed it too much because i had to read it to so fast and was 

558.48 559.68 A: forced to read it 

559.75 562.33 A: i um i enjoy reading things that i 

562.41 565.26 A: that i can um pick and choose and read at my own pace 

564.89 567.41 B: yeah so this is your preliminary exam 

567.25 568.45 A: (( right uh-huh )) 

568.32 572.55 B: yeah oh that's here's a regret when i took my preliminary exam 

572.66 574.66 B: it involved um 

574.83 586.21 B: a large part of it involved bayesian statistics you don't have to understand anything about bayesian statistics it's just that here's this guy bayes and he has this branch of statistics named after him 

587.06 594.87 B: and the exam i turned in the exam it's about fifty pages long by the time i get done writing about it and then um
