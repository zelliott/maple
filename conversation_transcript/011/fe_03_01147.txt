81.08 91.14 B: mm it's kind of hard now and now i have my son and it's [laughter] enrolling in the war that's going on now so i'm like ah it's kind of a distant memory 

92.45 93.62 A: wow 

96.08 98.11 A: so what about um 

98.61 105.18 A: what about if you could go back in time even to a time that you weren't born is there somewhere that you would like to have gone 

105.34 108.06 B: (( yeah ah mm )) 

109.36 116.57 B: i can't think of anything really i mean [laughter] my time that i've lived has been i can't think of maybe 

117.82 119.02 B: (( ah )) 

119.08 125.02 B: ah i don't know i think i like the world that i'm in today compared to what it was in the past 

126.23 132.64 A: is there a time that also like a time period that really interests you like the twenty- like um even like the one 

126.24 127.02 B: (( mm )) 

131.59 141.72 B: the twentieth yeah the roaring twenties and all that type of stuff it's interesting but i don't think i would have enjoyed living it because of ah what people went through and 

141.74 146.49 B: like the depression and i don't know there's a lot of things that went on with 

146.59 148.15 B: on back then so 

148.53 156.31 B: i like the world that [laughter] i'm in today [laughter] i'm more in to like yeah i i like the technology and 

151.29 152.92 A: if you like today's world 

156.38 163.89 B: but if i didn't know about the technology and and with how everything we have today is i probably wouldn't like to go back to um 

164.28 165.52 B: let's see 

165.96 168.93 A: do you think technology is the is the 

169.23 176.90 A: one of the biggest advances or is there something that you'd have a hard time living with like the technology that we have today do you think you'd have a hard time living without it 

175.41 189.03 B: leaving yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] like okay um not being able to be on my computer or my cell phone or even being able to you know to relax and watch t._v. or something like that 

177.73 179.37 A: what specifically 

189.78 197.17 A: so what type of things do you think they did to relax 'cause we use the computer and we use television what do you think they did 

190.13 190.69 B: (( [noise] )) 

196.57 202.01 B: probably like read ah newspapers or listen to the radio 

202.15 204.18 B: you know but um 

202.17 203.16 A: mhm 

204.66 210.29 B: there wasn't much for people to do back then that's why there's a bunch of kids [laughter] the baby boom 

207.23 208.18 A: [laughter] 

209.29 210.31 A: uh-huh 

210.47 214.22 B: there wasn't much for people to do to keep themselves entertained 

215.99 224.08 A: so you thinking that would be well how do you think that would be if they didn't even know that this technology existed do you think that that would be just one of the things that 

224.09 226.93 A: you know you just kind of lived your life and 

226.37 239.02 B: yeah mm just live your life how i'm sure there's going to be things twenty years from now that we don't have today that they probably wouldn't be able to live without so it's you know your era your time 

239.64 251.07 B: so but i don't know i me knowing that about what we have today i probably wouldn't want to [laughter] go back and live without things that i'm used to my normal every day life type things 

250.90 252.15 A: yeah 

251.91 252.75 B: (( mm )) 

252.77 253.86 B: (( ah [laughter] )) 

255.95 256.91 B: so 

256.30 263.13 A: i think i don't know i think i would really like to go back i have a real fascination with um the roman empire 

262.87 265.16 B: uh-huh yeah 

264.56 275.78 A: and i think it would be really neat to ah to have lived back with you know in the forum and the whole colosseum and the you know just how different life was back then 

272.30 273.16 B: [laughter] 

275.19 279.67 B: yeah i yeah i- i'd worry about though 

279.91 286.98 B: the roman times but they had hard times and the wars the spartan wars and all that type of stuff so 

283.08 284.07 A: yeah 

286.98 288.13 A: uh-huh 

287.43 290.64 B: but ah it's interesting you know 

291.02 291.79 B: you 

291.82 295.58 B: i'm sure everyone would like to go somewhere in time that ah 

296.24 304.67 B: but i don't know i'm more of a ordinary person i don't think i would [laughter] want to change my life right now 

304.63 310.64 A: you like it just how it is you like your computer and you like your television and 

306.25 311.65 B: yeah [laughter] yeah 

311.20 317.82 A: so what other what other um differences do you think that they had to deal with besides technology what about like clothing 

317.50 325.65 B: oh wow ah the clothing [noise] i mean i'd ah oh my son [laughter] but um 

326.02 328.47 B: a- it's interesting i think though 

328.48 335.03 B: you know i like the the vintage clothes clothing of the thirties and stuff but i don't know i 

334.76 335.74 A: mhm 

335.13 349.84 B: [mn] um you know i'm not really a fashion person but it's it's everyones tending to enjoy it now and you know everyone's trying to go back to you know the old days and the old styles but i don't know 

348.69 349.71 A: uh-huh 

349.95 351.06 A: mhm 

351.38 355.32 B: the clothing of the roman times [laughter] was barely any- 

355.55 358.00 B: anything at all well for the men 

357.05 358.08 A: (( i know [laughter] )) 

358.24 359.99 B: (( so i don't know [laughter] )) 

358.51 364.35 A: i know it seems like all i can think oh like with movies that are out seems like they all liked togas and 

363.20 365.89 B: yeah [laughter] 

364.87 367.99 A: and that's pretty much it that's what what comes to my mind 

367.50 369.70 B: yeah like the gladiator 

369.78 376.22 B: it's interesting you know the jousting and all that type of stuff but [laughter] i don't know i i 

374.72 375.98 A: (( wow )) 

376.26 386.77 B: i- it it seems kinda of barbaric to us now because [laughter] going and killing people for excitement i don't know i don't think i would have enjoyed watching that 

386.15 393.92 A: i know i don't think i would have either to even think about like their punishment i mean they had everything was you know public and 

386.80 388.36 B: [laughter] 

389.94 391.69 B: ye- oh yeah 

393.10 398.22 B: oh yeah stoning and all that type of [mn] i don't think i could live through that 

398.17 402.66 A: no i don't think i could've i don't think i would have enjoyed watching that either [noise] 

402.99 413.64 B: [laughter] but it seems like you know in the movies and stuff that they loved doing [laughter] they chanted and ah i'm more of a a lover not a fighter i don't like all the blood and gore and type of
