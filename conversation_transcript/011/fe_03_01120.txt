39.98 40.96 B: um 

41.65 42.45 B: i don't know 

43.52 46.64 B: not really sure a lot of things but not nothing in particular 

46.89 52.36 A: yeah there's um a million small things i can't think of anything on a major scale that i would do though 

53.03 54.15 B: no me either 

55.55 57.78 B: nothing that's really ruined my life 

58.41 58.88 A: (( )) 

59.75 66.56 A: (( as far as )) time travel again there's a a lot of things i'd like to go back to put myself in position so that i could view them first hand 

67.19 67.72 A: um 

67.20 67.58 B: right 

68.47 69.46 A: there's a couple of 

69.73 72.44 A: basketball games i'd like to see michael jordan playing

77.00 77.64 B: aging 

78.10 78.77 A: yeah 

78.46 79.89 B: like maybe things 

80.79 81.67 B: um 

82.12 87.08 B: i wish i had a lot more ambition in life to do a lot of things that i would like to do 

87.48 90.16 A: yeah and of course there's always that (( won't )) know 

90.27 92.34 A: well you would hope that you would know now 

92.97 94.74 A: when you go back everything that you know 

94.86 96.24 A: y- you didn't know then 

96.27 96.70 B: right 

97.43 99.63 A: you don't lose the knowledge when you don't go back hopefully 

99.78 100.21 B: right 

102.02 105.91 B: is this your a uh i know we're not suppose to switch the topic are you 

106.02 107.64 B: are you just a um 

108.71 113.04 B: are you a volunteer just like i am i mean just ask each other questions or 

113.06 114.79 A: yeah i'm just a volunteer 

114.82 115.43 B: yeah just 

116.69 122.07 B: so the topic of this is is just that topic today what wou- what would we do 

120.57 120.98 A: right 

123.27 124.23 B: if went (( )) 

124.39 134.17 B: or do over again well i can honestly say the most important thing i would change is definitely i would not have done drugs because i think it affected me as a adult now 

134.79 135.10 A: yeah 

135.22 137.97 B: so i'm going to have to say that's that's definitely 

138.62 140.95 B: there's a lot of things i missed out on doing that 

141.62 145.88 A: yeah and you know thinking about it um one of the things that i would go back and change 

146.04 146.56 A: um 

146.79 150.16 A: when i went to college i went to a major college instead of a smaller 

150.38 156.85 A: uh institution and i would have gone to i would have been the preferred to have been the big fish in a small pond instead of 

157.08 157.81 A: you know just 

158.03 159.13 A: one of the crowd 

159.36 159.81 B: right 

159.67 161.94 A: i think i i would have gone to a smaller school 

161.98 163.46 B: you would have gone to a smaller one 

163.81 164.20 A: yeah 

165.63 168.07 B: big doesn't always necessarily mean that 

168.50 169.94 B: you're going to get more out of it 

170.31 171.30 A: no not at all 

172.70 174.14 A: of course i did enjoy it but 

174.40 175.32 B: that's good 

174.43 177.44 A: yeah i think it would have been better for me had i gone to a smaller school 

177.45 178.07 B: right 

177.58 179.28 A: so that's one thing i would have changed 

181.95 183.03 B: i mean i guess they picked a 

183.12 185.05 B: a topic that i'm not really 

185.92 188.35 B: you know sure that was a tough topic uh 

188.27 189.66 A: yeah they they kind of 

190.09 192.56 A: dug down deep and pulled one out of nowhere on me 

192.67 193.17 B: right 

194.10 195.73 B: you know i know there's a lot of uh 

196.45 200.10 B: things in life i would have l- you know i would have liked to have done (( )) 

200.26 202.50 B: finances would have been available or 

203.20 207.13 B: you know stuff like that but i don't think there's anything i'd really change about my life 

207.81 208.69 B: been perfect 

209.42 210.11 B: been lucky 

210.41 210.77 B: so 

210.56 210.98 A: okay 

211.31 213.56 A: is there anything else that you would've um 

214.05 216.46 A: e- even minor things that you would have gone back to 

216.86 219.15 A: to alter put yourself in a different position 

219.38 220.97 A: gone left when you went right 

220.55 224.31 B: right right i mean small things like that yeah i've been into a 

221.17 221.94 A: that's what it's 

224.44 226.91 B: you know and my husband bought me a nice car and 

227.18 229.17 B: i wasn't paying attention and i wish for that 

229.61 231.58 B: split for second i would have paid attention and 

232.15 234.74 B: i would have definitely have my nice car to this day 

235.76 236.90 B: instead it got totaled 

237.99 241.37 B: and there's a lot of things that you say to people that you wish you could take back 

241.56 242.14 A: oh yes 

243.58 245.13 B: a lot of things i mean i could 

245.37 246.99 B: make a whole book about that 

247.93 249.85 B: things that you say to people what about you 

250.27 254.65 B: you've probably said something to somebody out of anger or something and wish you'd never said it 

255.02 256.64 A: oh on a daily basis 

255.30 256.18 B: or do you 

256.83 260.08 B: oh or you one of those that think before you say something 

259.67 265.38 A: well i try to think before i say something but it al- doesn't always work out that way

314.92 322.58 A: well l- let's um explore a little bit you said that if you h- could do it over you would have gone back and not done drugs what would have 

321.82 322.20 B: right 

322.68 323.00 A: (( )) 

323.39 325.77 A: can you think of exactly what may have been different

326.13 330.60 B: what may have been different um my relationship with my friends and my family would have 

331.35 333.67 B: definitely not gone sour at that 

334.33 334.90 B: you know 

335.93 337.35 B: luckily for me they all stuck

349.38 355.43 B: a lot of medical bills you know there's a lot of things that would be different would have been different had i not

391.48 392.17 A: it's all recorded 

394.13 394.88 B: well um 

395.68 396.63 B: i wish that 

397.03 398.58 B: that this winter i didn't 

398.90 403.37 B: have someone plow my driveway and put all the snow on the front lawn 

404.31 407.37 B: because now that spring is here everything is melting 

408.01 412.38 B: and there's this great big heap of snow on the front lawn that shouldn't be there 

412.75 416.15 B: so that's something i'd do over again i'd tell them not to 

415.27 415.59 A: yeah 

416.28 418.01 B: put snow on the front lawn 

419.27 421.82 A: it's been such a long time since i've even seen snow 

421.89 422.46 B: really 

422.77 423.18 A: yeah 

423.96 426.28 B: gosh we had a crazy winter 

428.70 435.04 A: well you know with um the one thing that you would change be not doing drugs i think the one thing that i w- may have changed um 

435.73 441.91 A: growing up is almost opposite not exactly but i think i would have gone out and done a few more 

442.68 444.90 A: uh out there things then 

444.76 445.33 B: yeah 

445.59 446.03 A: um 

446.64 447.14 A: because 

447.36 449.56 A: i was basically a boy scout growing up 

449.72 450.02 A: just 

449.85 452.31 B: so you never really experienced what the bad 

451.67 454.85 A: i didn't really experience much of anything um 

454.23 454.69 B: yeah 

455.47 456.61 A: uh school 

456.08 458.14 B: but you you would go back and change that 

456.85 457.22 A: sports 

458.36 461.66 A: i (( would )) try to change it i would have been a little more out there um 

462.28 465.19 A: you know i i didn't tas- taste alcohol until i was twenty 

465.35 465.83 B: right 

465.85 466.80 A: you know 

467.09 469.54 A: sneak a beer when you're sixteen uh 

468.81 469.35 B: uh-huh 

469.73 470.27 A: you know 

470.40 472.92 A: a a shot with the guys or something 

472.97 473.35 B: right 

473.45 474.42 A: but you know none of that 

474.68 478.69 A: so i i think i would have changed that and experienced a little bit more um 

479.26 479.87 B: yeah 

479.58 479.97 A: (( )) 

480.69 481.46 A: (( try to )) 

480.77 481.28 B: well 

481.63 484.12 A: you know keep it in moderation but but you know 

484.60 485.43 B: if you have if 

484.70 485.52 A: (( )) 

485.93 488.86 B: if you have a lot of will power and i'm not even sure that's what 

489.06 490.46 B: required but 

490.63 492.74 B: you know then to not get addicted 

493.44 493.74 A: yeah 

493.82 494.82 B: but you know then that's 

494.97 495.52 B: that's just 

495.79 498.95 B: good but some people don't have the ability 

499.65 503.63 B: to stop when they're suppose to stop and they keep going and going and 

504.58 507.09 B: then that's what i would change is i would change 

508.55 509.02 B: that 

512.12 512.48 A: yeah 

512.20 513.34 B: (( )) wouldn't have to 

514.05 516.75 B: it wouldn't i would not have gotten sick i would not have 

517.22 519.43 B: been mean and cruel to a lot of friends and 

519.65 519.97 A: right 

521.30 523.05 B: you would go ba- you would 

523.22 525.95 B: wish that you had experienced a little bit more of it 

526.88 528.78 A: or even just a little bit of it
