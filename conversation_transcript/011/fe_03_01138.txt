130.70 131.67 B: mhm 

131.06 132.77 A: college and um 

134.16 145.56 A: so anyway it was just it you know it was really a a time th- th- th- that i was not serious i graduated a year early from highschool so i was a little young and um 

146.12 147.36 A: probably not 

147.51 151.61 A: quite as mature as as i would 

151.84 159.89 A: you know as i can see now i mean of course at that time i thought i was just really big stuff [laughter] right um 

157.04 158.13 B: right 

159.92 164.61 A: but you know as i look back on it now i think you know i just could've made 

165.11 166.47 A: me better 

166.54 171.69 A: better grades better use of my time but i majored in music 

172.85 175.57 B: and then did you use that afterwards 

173.23 173.85 A: (( so )) 

175.81 183.47 A: actually um you know i didn't [laughter] other than for um but not professionally i use i use it in my 

183.83 191.42 A: life um ah and y- y- you know it's a i it's it was um vocal music so i 

191.57 192.68 A: really 

193.00 199.67 A: have used it over the years um in a number of different ways in my church and and different 

198.79 199.62 B: right 

199.80 203.28 A: things but um now actually i went into 

203.63 210.79 A: sales and um kind of went up through the ranks of the sales management and so forth but um 

210.53 212.45 B: that's much different 

211.67 218.45 A: yeah [laughter] very different very very very different but um you know it it 

218.75 221.31 A: it's been a good career so [sigh] um 

221.98 223.99 A: anyways well what about you 

224.07 232.45 B: yeah mine was sort of along the same lines but i was trying to think of something more [laughter] interesting like um 

230.83 232.14 A: [laughter] 

232.55 233.49 B: i 

233.76 237.34 B: was thinking about um i'm in grad school right now 

237.16 237.86 A: (( ha )) 

237.64 240.68 B: and um when i graduated from 

240.77 250.66 B: college i took about five years off in between and i didn't really know that i was going to go on to school and so 

251.02 255.98 B: i didn't have a lot of direction during those five years you know i worked and i 

253.96 254.87 A: uh-huh 

256.55 258.41 B: travelled a bit but i 

258.62 259.50 B: you know 

259.81 264.34 B: wasn't quick to think about going on to school and 

264.36 270.53 B: now that i'm there i'm i'm really enjoying myself i just went back at the beginning of this year 

270.26 271.29 A: really 

271.31 272.45 B: and 

273.04 278.59 B: from the moment i started school i really started regretting that i didn't do this sooner 

278.48 279.15 A: mm 

279.91 282.41 B: so it's something where 

283.10 286.81 B: you know i've enjoyed i've enjoyed the last five years but i've also 

288.03 298.99 B: am enjoying what i'm doing so much now i'm studying i'm teaching english as a second language i decided you know getting involved in teaching classes and i really feel like that's 

294.08 295.07 A: (( mm mm )) 

299.72 302.30 B: my niche that's what i want to do 

302.92 304.32 B: and so 

304.61 310.40 B: you know i've kind of regretted not getting more experience or not getting into it quicker 

310.10 311.09 A: mhm 

311.02 311.96 B: so 

312.21 318.39 B: and along the same lines when i was an undergrad i i didn't think i would ever go on to a masters so i didn't 

318.82 324.87 B: i probably wasn't as focused on the grades and um you know getting 

322.24 323.30 A: mhm 

325.06 329.73 B: experience in classrooms or you know getting the kind of experience that 

330.30 334.00 B: might help me later if i were to you know go on so 

333.98 334.70 A: oh 

335.84 338.35 B: but i'm enjoying what i'm doing now so 

338.06 341.57 A: oh good that's interesting okay and and so you're 

342.49 344.92 A: you're going to get your masters in 

345.36 347.49 A: in languages or what 

347.25 352.06 B: um it's a t._e._s._o._l. teaching english to speakers of other languages so it's through 

352.15 354.77 B: (( an linguistics department )) 

354.56 355.32 A: (( oh )) 

355.01 358.18 B: and then um i'm also studying japanese 

358.13 365.08 A: oh cool do you hope to go there and be a translator or or do something 

365.43 369.93 A: with the government in that regard or what what's your eventual hope 

369.51 374.69 B: um i thought about spending time in japan and i think if 

374.55 388.41 B: i find myself graduated and i don't have a lot of if i don't have anything i mean keeping me in the states it's hard to tell what you're life is going to be like in a couple of years whether it will be easy to move to another country or not 

382.15 383.09 A: mhm 

385.62 386.42 A: (( yeah )) 

388.08 389.06 A: right 

388.53 389.43 B: um 

389.79 392.18 B: then i would probably do that there's a lot of 

392.53 395.94 B: like good programmes teaching english in japan and 

395.30 396.32 A: (( mm )) 

396.04 396.96 B: um 

396.97 400.69 B: i thought about government work to but i think it would depend on um 

402.64 404.49 B: i think about time or 

404.16 405.15 A: sure 

404.56 406.04 B: you know just kind of 

407.05 412.03 B: i don't want to get sent somewhere that i'm not ready to be if i start doing government work 

411.68 412.69 A: mhm 

412.43 420.96 B: or get involved in something that i'm not ready to be involved with so i've just trying to keep the options open next quarter i'm going to be assisting 

420.99 424.32 B: um one of our professors 

424.44 426.62 B: um teaching english 

426.65 427.34 A: (( mm )) 

426.92 428.95 B: we have a programme where 

429.51 431.21 B: you know students come 

431.24 435.96 B: from a lot of students seem to come from japan and korea china 

435.59 436.75 A: (( really )) 

436.41 442.12 B: um to study english and so i'll you know be helping teaching a class like that 

438.31 439.04 A: oh 

441.44 443.34 A: (( what what school were you okay )) 

443.36 445.17 B: brooklyn state university 

445.62 446.32 A: oh 

446.67 455.83 B: and i've also done some obser- observing in um classes more for refugees and not necessarily through the university but 

455.98 459.85 B: through community colleges or community organizations 

460.19 464.25 B: and so i've been going it seems like two different 

464.37 467.59 B: um futures you know working with 

467.77 472.87 B: people that are here to try to make a new life in the united states need 

473.09 480.20 B: a whole different set of skills than somebody that's going to go back to their home country and maybe try to use english in business or so 

481.11 481.88 A: oh 

482.95 486.47 B: i have been going back and forth between those it 

483.24 484.14 A: (( oh oh )) 

486.56 487.33 A: (( really )) 

487.49 489.14 A: (( well that's interesting )) 

488.72 491.06 B: probably depends on who will hire me 

491.00 492.55 A: [laughter] 

491.12 495.36 B: [laughter] you know you do the same stuff for either of them so 

492.77 494.21 A: yeah 

494.81 499.76 A: and you know that's really [laughter] that is really what it all boils down to i mean 

499.98 505.24 A: if you find if you can end up finding a job that you love that you don't 

505.40 509.78 A: dread getting up in the morning and going to that's [laughter] certainly 

510.05 510.96 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

510.29 516.39 A: certainly the goal and you know that's what happened with me i just happened on to 

516.59 520.05 A: this company that i really liked and um 

520.34 525.49 A: you know and i needed to work you know i was school i had student loans 

525.87 533.62 A: out there ahead of me and so it was time you know to definitely do something and um 

534.24 536.18 A: you know it just didn't 

536.19 540.83 A: it really you know i was very unfocussed so i didn't really know what 

540.92 550.54 A: i would do with that degree once i got done with it 'cause you know i didn't do like a go teaching thing or anything like that it was just you know vocal performance and 

550.76 556.26 A: you know there are i mean the the percentage of people that that 

556.45 559.55 A: actually do um 

560.47 565.62 A: um go professional and have a a professional career 

565.80 569.20 A: in music are the numbers are few so you've got 

568.71 570.51 B: right right right 

569.51 572.31 A: to be something really really special to 

572.76 574.90 A: either to get that but ah 

574.58 579.49 B: but i think in general college gives you a set of skills no matter what 

579.11 583.31 A: oh absolutely just yeah to 

580.13 581.00 B: (( definitely )) 

583.39 589.97 A: be able to you know live your life and and oh no question about it i mean i think 

590.26 591.21 A: (( um )) 

592.13 597.02 A: i think everybody should have that college experience you know it's 

597.03 599.89 B: i studied my under graduate i studied anthropology which
