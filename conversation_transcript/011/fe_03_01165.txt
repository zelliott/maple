177.29 177.99 B: oh 

178.23 179.17 A: and then um 

179.41 180.62 A: we came here so

182.52 183.28 B: oh okay i had a 

183.40 185.03 B: friend who lived in flint michigan 

185.17 185.73 A: oh yeah 

185.77 187.45 B: yeah i've been there before it's very beautiful 

188.14 188.94 A: you thought so 

188.92 192.86 B: yeah i thought so i mean but it was many years ago i don't know if it is anymore maybe it's not 

193.11 194.86 A: well compared to california 

193.75 196.00 B: seems like a long time ago 

196.44 197.60 A: are you from california 

197.31 198.84 B: oh yeah yeah i'm from california 

199.17 201.02 A: i- i think compared to california it's 

201.29 201.82 A: -s uh 

202.36 203.83 A: well it's very flat there 

203.91 204.52 B: uh-huh 

204.55 207.31 A: and so you know you don't get any of the mountains 

207.47 208.07 A: um 

208.23 211.25 A: and i guess in some parts there's there's the water the lake 

210.98 211.36 B: uh-huh 

211.61 212.27 A: but um 

212.94 215.03 A: just the natural beauty that's in california is 

215.56 217.26 B: you think so i don't know maybe i'm 

215.86 216.40 A: not there 

217.89 224.92 B: i'm i don't know i'm jaded or something -cause i i grew up i've always lived in california so it's kind of like eh no big deal to me 

219.20 219.97 A: i don't know 

225.17 225.65 A: oh 

225.34 230.75 B: i guess i'm spoiled because you know we have the mountains to one side and the beach to the other and 

225.86 226.66 A: you're over it 

228.64 229.00 A: mhm 

230.54 232.02 A: i know you do 

231.34 231.88 B: i should be 

232.10 233.69 B: g- grateful for that but i don't know 

233.90 234.93 A: you do get 

235.03 235.55 A: spoiled 

235.81 236.31 A: um 

235.97 236.66 B: yeah you do 

237.58 240.37 A: yeah i lived in michigan for five years and uh 

239.46 239.90 B: mhm 

240.82 242.59 A: i was totally missing california 

242.33 246.59 B: oh really oh okay maybe if i did live somewhere else i probably would miss california i don't know 

243.28 243.82 A: oh yeah 

246.86 247.67 A: yeah yeah 

247.23 252.81 B: but uh uh i don't know so what what are we we are supposed to be talking about what we 

253.03 253.99 B: what we um 

254.19 256.83 B: what we missed out on is that what we are supposed to be doing 

254.50 254.83 A: yeah 

256.86 259.23 A: what what we would have changed or something 

258.80 261.41 B: yeah -cause i'm i'm a little confused of 

262.30 264.15 B: m- they stop us or how how does 

264.06 265.31 A: yeah i think after ten 

264.51 267.22 B: my this is my first one so i don't know is this yours 

266.67 268.14 A: yeah this is my first one too 

267.99 268.50 B: okay 

268.90 271.98 A: um i'm assuming though after ten minutes or something they will probably 
272.69 274.02 A: come on and say you are done 

275.15 275.65 A: i don't know 

275.74 276.49 B: oh okay 

276.88 280.92 A: but do you like think about things that you wish you would have done differently in life 

279.78 282.00 B: oh yeah de- definitely yeah 

282.16 282.64 A: yeah 

282.21 292.80 B: definitely all the time unfortunately yes because i had ah you know i didn't have the privilege of going to college right out of school -cause i couldn't afford it my parents couldn't afford it 

283.87 284.45 A: really 

292.90 293.31 B: so 

293.76 294.36 B: um 

294.46 297.74 B: you know it was not uh it wasn't it wasn't really 

297.91 300.00 B: not a choice i pretty much had to work because 

300.17 306.81 B: about i'm i'm a little bit older so back then it was like if you didn't have the money to go to college no one would help you go to college 

307.37 311.68 B: unless you you probably i probably could've taken out you know a lot of loans and things but i 

311.92 313.59 B: chose to got to work and 

314.01 315.30 B: it was good to get the experience 

315.43 318.61 B: but you know now nowadays you need to have that degree so 

320.27 321.44 A: were you married or 

321.42 324.34 B: yeah oh yeah i was i got married after and and i have uh i have 

323.37 324.02 A: oh okay 

324.79 325.37 B: two children 

325.66 326.14 A: mhm 

326.54 328.08 B: but i'm not married anymore and 

328.63 330.37 B: single mom trying to survive on 

331.70 334.18 B: the salary i i work and i go to school so it's hard 

333.87 334.42 A: wow 

334.58 336.90 B: full time job and i go to u. u._s._c. so 

337.09 337.65 A: oh wow

341.71 342.81 B: three times a week and 

342.70 343.58 A: oh wow 

342.99 345.84 B: i'm making up the times on other days but 

345.47 346.14 A: that's nice 

345.97 355.49 B: but yeah no i don't i'm a junior i don't have i -cause i went two years at community college at night and so i transferred in to u. u._s._c. this is my first semester and um it's it's 

350.50 350.93 A: okay 

352.66 353.22 A: oh good 

358.98 359.43 A: uh-huh 

362.60 363.01 B: full but 

363.50 368.97 B: i don't know they're they're pretty well c- in the beginning it was but now they seem to be pretty nice you know but i still feel kind of 

363.52 364.71 A: is it uncomfortable 

369.55 372.98 B: i don't know like when i'm in discussion groups i don't want to be too 

373.48 375.46 B: outspoken because you know i want to 

374.47 374.90 A: mhm 

376.11 378.19 B: you know my opinion is going to be way different than theirs 

378.35 378.93 A: mhm 

378.75 379.72 B: obviously but 

379.90 380.40 A: mhm 

381.28 381.68 B: it's it's 

381.79 382.92 B: fun though it's an experience 

383.37 384.03 A: yeah

385.50 385.98 A: mhm 

385.98 389.34 B: and i think being older you appreciate school more when i 

391.84 392.96 A: yeah definitely 

393.23 396.82 A: i mean that's something that i notice i mean i just finished teaching a course 

397.40 398.85 A: at santa cruz and um 

398.34 398.92 B: oh 

399.68 400.16 A: i- the 

400.42 401.17 A: the students 

402.15 402.83 A: um 

403.71 405.34 A: i don't know i mean they they 

405.56 406.15 A: seem like 

406.33 408.94 A: they're here to do anything but 

409.47 411.87 A: sort of go to class and learn 

411.99 412.61 B: yeah that's 

412.71 413.95 B: true i noticed that uh-huh 

414.24 414.53 A: and it's 

414.64 421.64 A: tough i mean especially as an instructor -cause i'm teaching something that i love and i want them to if not love it at least 

421.85 426.33 A: try and learn it and think about it a little bit and they are trying to figure out 

426.54 426.84 A: what 

427.34 427.96 A: sort of the least 

428.82 430.72 A: amount of work that they can do 

431.13 433.09 A: you know and get a good grade or whatever 

432.82 435.28 B: you're you're one of the lucky ones you you 

435.66 437.11 B: are doing what you love and you've 

437.76 443.05 B: you you know you don't really have any regrets to go back and change so you're you are absolutely one of the lucky ones 

443.34 444.86 A: i know i guess so 

443.83 446.94 B: very few yeah very few people have that luxury you know that they 

447.36 450.07 B: they did everything they you know they've planned on doing and they 

450.18 454.09 B: they accomplished it i mean i'm sure you have a lot more to accomplish but i'm saying so far i'm sure you're
