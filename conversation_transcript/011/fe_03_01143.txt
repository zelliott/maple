481.91 487.55 A: do this or do that now you need to tell your kids to do that so going back in town i 

487.88 488.61 A: you know i could 

489.65 489.93 A: give

541.56 543.67 B: okay something else i could change 

546.67 547.66 A: well like you said 

547.94 549.53 A: if we did change 

550.45 555.81 A: where where would be where would we even be i mean that is just totally something that i couldn't even 

557.67 559.23 A: propose in my head 

559.39 563.73 A: because if we would go back and change exp- especially if it was something big like 

563.83 566.80 A: you know yeah i did actually make it through college 

566.99 568.61 A: then where would i be now 

568.73 571.00 A: you know that's something i don't even want to think about 

571.59 573.41 B: well yeah that could be depressing
