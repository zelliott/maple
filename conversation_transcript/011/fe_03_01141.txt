15.08 16.35 B: um 

16.57 17.38 B: mm 

17.97 19.49 B: what would i change 

22.55 24.98 B: mm i'm actually not sure do you 

25.11 26.78 B: have do you have something in mind 

27.81 35.03 A: well i think that if i had to if i could go back and change something i think i'd change the way our judicial system works 

28.67 33.91 B: (( mhm )) 

34.79 39.07 B: (( oh really what would you change )) 

35.67 37.30 A: yep 

37.64 47.36 A: oh yeah well i think that i would go back and take a look in history when we actually started um 

39.40 62.30 B: (( it )) 

47.76 58.58 A: making sentences easier and getting away from capital punishment and and making it a little bit easier for criminals and for the people who've been in prison to to 

58.90 60.28 A: use the ah 

60.86 70.18 A: use the appeals and um you know if i had any kind of influence that's that's what i would go back and change because i think that we're 

70.56 75.05 A: just way too lenient on certain people that commit crimes 

74.99 82.60 B: to i i actually i think i agree with you on that um we are getting too lenient about stuff like that sort of thing 

83.60 84.63 B: um 

85.51 86.64 B: (( and )) 

86.53 94.00 A: not not that i would put everyone to death i mean you know i'm i'm but i mean you know i just think that our judicial system 

86.89 88.13 B: let's 

88.91 91.70 B: see no i i understand yeah it's 

92.19 101.36 B: just mhm it's just a little easy to get around it no 

94.05 97.64 A: doesn't sometimes the punishment just doesn't fit the crime these days 

103.80 105.11 B: um 

105.44 108.76 B: see if i could go back and change something 

110.30 111.54 B: mm 

118.50 126.70 A: i'm assuming that that's what they're talking about instead of me personally but i i mean is that what you got out of it 

120.53 121.50 B: (( let's )) 

121.88 126.78 B: see mhm i'm not i'm not really sure 

127.13 132.35 B: but i guess i think i've i think either way might be fine 

132.68 141.35 B: i'm not sure exactly what they're studying like on in this ah but um let's 

139.95 142.56 A: so what would you go back and change 

142.32 145.69 B: (( see i think i would change hm ah i think )) 

155.32 173.44 B: (( right )) 

157.29 158.45 A: (( [sigh] )) 

186.53 188.70 B: now ah 

188.87 194.24 B: i feel like we sh- that i would like to have gone back and changed our um election system 

195.08 197.21 B: 'cause ah i don't think the 

197.67 211.51 B: electoral college is the best idea for um electing a president and um i don't know i just the last election it just seemed very um sort of 

202.24 203.56 A: right 

212.30 220.31 B: i don't know uncontrolled and it wasn't it wasn't really as dignified as it should be so i 

215.50 216.41 A: yeah 

218.64 224.79 A: yeah i agree i i live in florida [laughter] so i definitely agree 

221.31 223.07 B: oh okay 

223.08 237.19 B: yeah so and and i think i don't know it was close enough that that sort of thing doesn't impact like that you know it's not just like electoral vote and road doesn't necessarily mean the same thing and 

225.14 226.02 A: no i 

237.62 246.51 A: absolutely yeah i was having a conversation with some folks just the other day on that and you know it's sad when we can't even elect our own president any more 

245.92 251.24 B: (( yeah )) 

246.62 249.39 A: and people that we do vote into office 

249.49 256.48 A: it seems that sometimes they get sidetracked to their own agendas or they compromise the things that we actually put them in office for 

251.39 259.79 B: mhm [noise] yeah mhm which i don't know it seemed like a little bit like today 

259.30 259.86 A: (( [mn] )) 

259.92 264.21 B: just recently [noise] with what's been going on with the war um 

263.42 265.36 A: do you do you agree with the war 

265.24 275.60 B: um i'm not sure i just i'm just i just don't think it's like the smartest idea just because i feel like if we attack iraq we're going to make um 

276.66 278.77 B: we're going to make the terrorists you know 

278.72 293.47 B: see it like see it as an attack against islam and that's not good for our safety so is it i mean it just doesn't seem like the sort of thing we should be doing like if we're if we're trying to 

293.52 294.45 B: you know 

294.59 299.12 B: (( not if we're not trying to if we're trying to protect ourselves from terrorism because )) 

302.11 307.32 A: yeah i mean in in some ways i i agree with you and in some ways i feel that 

302.23 303.18 B: (( that's )) 

303.03 330.02 B: (( just )) 

307.46 315.35 A: kinda what the president said tonight that you know if if we don't react because this guys had twelve years to 

315.48 319.88 A: of resolutions that he just completely um 

319.69 330.82 A: did not follow but you know i think eventually he will be even a bigger threat than what he is if we let him go on so i kinda have mixed emotions about sending people over their to war but at the same token 

331.02 340.13 A: i think that you know if we let people like that who who have the ruthless aggression against anyone i mean even his own people you know then 

340.21 342.09 A: i think that's you know 

342.10 349.22 A: that's something that you know i guess from a from a bigger picture of of you know like the president has looked at that you know 

349.32 352.30 A: somewhere we gotta we gotta draw the line in the sand 

350.34 356.03 B: (( going to make them angrier mhm mhm yeah yeah yeah )) 

354.71 362.16 A: but ah you know it's the same thing you know i i guess if i was looking at the thing i would change parties and would be the if 

359.85 387.06 B: (( it )) 

362.95 363.96 A: um 

364.01 376.55 A: congress and our senate and the way that tings operate you know from a political standpoint as well you know and that kinda ties into the elections because if you look at it from the way that 

376.70 385.49 A: our country is being run with versus the way that it was actually set up to be run i think that we've compromised a lot and ah kinda taken away 

385.99 400.62 A: not necessarily the liberties but the freedoms that a lot of people had 'cause you know i mean we it's not any it's not the people speaking anymore as much as it is congress and you know our our legislators 

400.18 407.51 B: it's gotten away from what the people think to what the people in congress are thinking 

402.69 404.57 A: yep 

404.75 405.68 A: and ah 

407.69 409.21 A: yep so 

408.27 413.55 B: and with the way it is you can't really change that for 'cause it it just stays that way 

413.12 425.42 A: exactly and i mean i was reading an article where if we went back and revamped our our congress and our legislation to back the way that it used to be it would set our country back what two hundred years 

420.51 422.47 B: mhm 

425.29 430.58 B: (( yeah )) 

426.17 432.56 A: just to get that's how long it would take to get through all the red tape and all the things that we screwed up as a country 

433.25 436.07 A: so it's kind of you know 

435.74 443.30 B: mhm yeah it's discouraging to see see here that 

436.55 437.61 A: i mean 

437.66 447.14 A: yeah well politic- you know politics and and [noise] the legal system is two very controversial issues you know i mean it's almost like talking about you know 

444.71 447.92 B: yes that's true 

447.41 452.84 A: and ah but i mean you know the the one good thing about this country is you have a right to your opinion 

453.03 455.31 A: you're supposed to be able to voice your opinion 

453.12 457.39 B: (( mhm )) 

455.58 460.31 A: and sometimes it sounds like the people's opinions aren't really heard 

459.87 472.76 B: yeah that's true ah i'm from pennsylvania actually yeah um it's a little like maybe forty miles west of philadelphia 

461.09 461.96 A: so 

462.53 464.52 A: ah where are you from 

465.47 466.29 A: are you 

466.81 468.29 A: what part 

472.22 475.54 A: oh okay so i've lived in pittsburg for five years 

474.98 475.83 B: (( oh oh )) 

476.52 480.98 B: (( okay i have i have some friends going to pittsburg -burg college )) 

482.57 488.28 A: so i mean as far as the the legal system i mean if if you had to 

488.55 497.97 A: if you had to put your life or your family someone in your family's life in the hands of our legal system i mean would you feel completely comfortable 

492.69 493.77 B: yeah 

496.12 508.94 B: see yeah i don't i don't think i would at this point like it it just seems it just seems like there's just too many ways we get around words actually like what the issue is and what actually happened and 

509.18 558.84 B: (( just )) 

510.55 516.70 A: and you know it it it seems like it it all kinda works together as far as the judicial system and ah 

516.92 520.85 A: um the the voting like you said because 

520.88 527.40 A: you know we vote these folks in to office that are supposed to protect the laws and and implement the laws but 

527.35 541.56 A: it seems like when you know when they're campaigning everything they have all these objectives you know supposedly that they're they're representing the people but then they have to compromise all these things once they get into office to get anything passed 

541.69 555.99 A: and a lot of times that comes down to whether you know a minority you know whether they be liberal or whether they be um you know african american mexican whatever the case may be that they're more interested in their vote to 

555.90 566.77 A: you know be re-elected than they are in the real issues and that's you know that's the reason from a legal standpoint i feel that it's the same way you know we 

567.04 574.27 A: we take a look at what everybody else thinks about it versus you know the the right and wrong of it 

574.44 576.12 A: so 

576.01 579.24 A: you know it it just it just makes me have 

579.07 588.71 A: question i guess question not that i'm i'm anti-legal or anti you know political but it just makes me really question where we're going as a country and i know 

588.51 597.67 A: you know i have three kids and it concerns me that the way that we're headed you know what's what's their future going to look like 

591.51 592.07 B: (( you )) 

592.83 595.75 B: (( know if well it's yeah mhm yeah mhm yeah yeah yes )) 

596.09 599.95 B: mhm mhm mhm yeah i i g-
