59.53 59.97 A: like 

60.78 61.43 A: um 

61.64 65.13 A: i don't know the outcome of a war or something that would be 

64.88 65.29 B: right 

65.87 68.44 A: something that i i would obviously choose to do 

68.90 72.32 A: um um certainly now since 

72.43 73.06 A: that's kind of 

73.22 74.42 A: right right at the moment 

74.76 84.95 B: right exactly if you could go back just a very short amount of time maybe there was something that any one person could do six or seven months ago to change where we're at now 

79.26 80.31 A: yeah exactly 

85.08 87.44 A: exactly exactly that would be uh 

86.01 86.43 B: no 

87.54 87.95 A: i mean 

88.38 90.44 A: if you could do that that certainly 

90.79 92.27 A: uh that would be very of course 

92.91 94.09 A: i don't know 

94.20 96.50 A: if everybody had the opportunity to do that 

96.85 98.62 A: who knows what would happen then too 

97.86 105.75 B: right it would just become yeah a big chaotic thing i i guess it's uh i don't know i always take it whenever i hear time travel stories that 

105.93 112.97 B: there's if it ever does come to pass that it's going to be there's going to be a single pioneer who has like opportunities to do things like this 

112.67 113.74 A: and 

113.63 116.79 B: so at least for that window there's going to be the opportunity 

117.71 119.00 B: or the threat 

119.21 122.09 B: of someone tampering with the past i mean 

122.91 129.91 B: i don't know how reasonable that that may or may never be i mean you know we can't look in the future far enough to know 

130.03 130.42 B: but 

131.32 131.74 A: but it 

131.35 132.09 B: i don't know 

132.19 133.07 B: go head 

133.15 136.33 A: well i was just going to say it certainly is fun to contemplate isn't it 

136.19 139.79 B: yeah no i mean i think everybody is definitely a a daydream 

139.97 141.26 B: daydream sort of thing to 

141.37 142.00 B: think about 

142.11 142.43 B: but 

143.39 144.82 B: i don't know i guess i i 

144.94 149.97 B: kind of took the topic to mean in our lifetime and i i guess personally 

150.84 152.07 B: there's just a lot of 

152.76 153.94 B: of little things 

154.07 154.83 B: i guess 

155.13 157.26 B: i mean some of them are kind of sad but 

157.81 159.38 B: i don't know like a friend of mine 

160.02 161.75 B: uh few months ago 

161.99 166.08 B: uh in september actually lost his wife at a very early age 

166.50 170.17 B: and he's had a lot of guilt over the fact that he left the hospital 

170.81 175.08 B: to go get her uh an overnight bag and wasn't with her when she passed 

176.10 179.22 B: little stuff like that in people's lives that i know 

179.53 181.88 B: that i don't think they would have any grand outcome 

182.47 185.43 B: as far as like really changing how far things turn out 

185.60 186.09 A: mhm 

186.08 187.64 B: but just allowing them 

188.40 192.68 B: the knowledge that you should make a different choice maybe counter to what 

192.94 193.86 B: what is 

194.43 196.04 B: what's logical or what's right 

196.52 198.43 B: at this moment in order to 

199.16 201.99 B: give yourself and you know your loved ones peace 

202.73 203.72 B: and um 

204.07 208.78 B: i don't know i think about that and i i always think about what if i could write a book 

216.04 220.30 B: and you could give any number of pages of those pages to yourself throughout your life 

220.62 223.82 B: up to this point i've often thought about that daydream as well 

224.12 224.58 A: yeah 

224.50 235.82 B: you know if i could give myself a a a i don't know about about fifty pages at the outset of puberty and then maybe another twenty at uh when i graduated from high school 

236.17 236.68 A: yeah 

236.26 241.06 B: and yeah distribute five or ten every every uh couple of years 

241.42 244.90 B: you know that that would be something that would really 

242.01 242.28 A: well the 

245.51 250.09 B: appreciate i don't know but you never know how tampering is going to turn out like that 

249.41 253.75 A: well and that's yeah that's always the thing too there's always that uh question about 

254.25 255.64 A: um you know if you 

255.85 257.13 A: if you mess with something 

257.61 258.00 A: what 

258.13 261.45 A: actually happens what unintended consequences will occur 

261.15 261.62 B: right 

262.22 262.62 A: so 

262.24 266.24 B: the flap of the butterfly wing in china causing cyclones in 

266.98 268.55 B: the pacific that sort of thing 

268.66 270.49 A: yeah exactly exactly 

269.19 269.53 B: you know 

270.17 270.49 B: (( so )) 

270.71 271.19 A: um 

271.72 272.22 A: you know 

273.01 274.04 A: quite frankly 

274.32 274.91 A: um 

275.77 277.64 A: if i could go back in time 

278.12 278.50 A: you know 

279.77 281.03 A: one of the things that 

281.26 282.25 A: i would do 

282.71 284.32 A: one uh actually the 

284.56 287.46 A: the thing that i would probably choose to do is i would probably choose to 

286.29 286.72 B: mhm 

287.95 291.67 A: to go and back and try it over again and just do a better job 

292.57 293.08 B: yeah 

292.63 293.09 A: you know 

293.69 298.99 B: i'm i'm tempted on that one sometimes when i when i kind of indulge this sort of fantasy but 

299.31 300.78 B: at the same time 

300.89 301.34 B: i'm 

301.76 302.38 B: i'm not 

303.08 306.11 B: i'm i'm humbly satisfied with where i am in life 

306.55 306.98 A: uh-huh 

306.80 312.76 B: you know i'm not i i i i recognize that there's room for improvement and i recognize that there's been mistakes that i've made 

313.32 315.01 B: but i'm i'm pretty 

315.28 316.59 B: i i kind of like 

326.70 334.91 B: and hadn't made as many dumb mistakes over and over again you know what what attributes would i lose as a function of that 

335.41 336.01 B: um 

336.52 338.73 B: i don't know i mean yeah i've got a couple of real 

339.00 344.22 B: bone head days that i sure wish that i could get back but uh 

342.67 343.21 A: yeah 

343.67 344.95 A: me too 

344.70 352.85 B: but all in all i can't i i i don't know i'd i'd be again uh i'd be afraid that the people in my life now 

353.18 354.64 B: that i wouldn't have 

355.17 358.69 B: been at the point in my life i i needed to be to be 

359.54 365.13 B: with them you know like my my friends and you know my girlfriend and um 

365.33 367.21 A: well yeah that's a very good point 

365.90 366.60 B: i don't know 

376.52 379.97 B: the relationship is based on the condition you each were in when you met 

380.54 383.36 A: absolutely absolutely and and uh 

381.06 381.47 B: you know 

381.97 382.60 B: so 

384.13 384.81 A: um 

385.11 385.75 A: there's uh 

385.93 393.40 A: there's an old british saying nothing (( propinqs )) like propinquity nothing is you know gets you closer than being close 

392.78 393.28 B: right 

393.55 395.23 A: it really is true because if you're 

395.38 396.48 A: if you are 

396.64 397.43 A: you know close 

398.95 399.50 A: to 

399.94 400.30 A: (( )) 

400.43 402.71 A: in physical proximity to someone 

403.24 403.73 A: um 

403.86 405.70 A: you know i mean that's a person 

406.21 407.78 A: that you're you're going to 

408.08 409.24 A: more likely eh 

409.38 411.26 A: work to find 

411.96 413.50 A: uh things in common with 

413.99 414.42 B: right 

414.40 415.76 A: and you know so i mean 

416.06 419.57 A: you're right if you if you were to go back and change things 

419.86 423.23 A: yes you're experience would be different you'd have less in common with 

423.75 426.03 A: some folks and more in common with other folks 

426.52 427.03 B: right 

426.52 427.04 A: and you would 

427.38 428.24 A: you know i mean 

428.91 433.39 A: everything would be different my my wife and i uh talk about this every 

433.61 435.88 A: you know every once in a great while about how 

436.39 436.76 A: we 

436.99 439.59 A: just happen to come together 

440.09 440.38 A: at 

440.57 441.34 A: you know just 

442.03 444.66 A: just a a a faithful moment for the two of us 

444.95 445.38 B: right 

445.45 446.04 A: um 

446.33 447.65 A: and you know (( that )) 

448.39 451.29 A: we met and it all you know worked out and 

451.68 452.27 A: um 

452.38 454.01 A: you know we've been married for 

454.39 456.82 A: uh a long time now thirteen years and 

456.78 457.88 B: wow that's awesome 

457.39 458.11 A: and uh 

459.74 462.08 A: it's it's a quirk though because 

462.80 463.38 A: um 

464.62 467.96 A: we met because she lived around the corner from where i lived 

468.45 470.78 A: uh when i was living in new york city but i'm not 

470.97 472.01 A: from new york city 

472.41 472.87 B: mhm 

472.54 476.00 A: and i had only been living there for a few months and 

476.34 477.26 A: you know it was just 

477.65 478.75 A: one of those weird 

479.47 480.09 A: space things 

480.37 484.07 A: if i had it to do all over again you know and i did it differently 

484.62 484.88 A: i 

485.45 485.98 A: doubt 

486.15 487.40 A: that we would have even met 

487.97 488.79 A: it was just uh 

488.06 488.68 B: right 

489.19 491.78 A: an accident of circumstance that we even met 

504.29 512.15 B: that the only reason we met is because i decided to leach on an extra semester at some student housing that i was staying at 

512.33 512.87 A: uh-huh 

512.86 514.32 B: and after 

514.72 515.49 B: after 

515.78 517.24 B: basically 

517.47 518.88 B: failing my classes 

519.43 525.89 B: i had a really bad semester where i had to wor- i had to work a lot more than i had expected to and i i (( uh )) 

526.86 530.23 B: hadn't eh eh had failed uh failed two classes and and ended up 

530.74 533.51 B: being able to stay with the student housing although it was frowned upon 

533.86 536.49 B: and she was here from sweden for one semester 

537.08 540.49 B: as a visiting scholar and here i am trying to (( )) 

540.88 543.72 B: beat out an undergraduate degree in my late twenties 

544.31 546.21 B: and she's a p._h._d. candidate 

546.32 552.10 B: you know where am i going to meet you know (( )) there was no other there was no place where i would've normally met her 

552.46 553.72 B: had i left 

554.60 555.57 B: school and left 

555.71 558.31 B: the uh you know academic environment at that time 

558.18 558.74 A: right 

559.03 563.76 B: i mean there there's just no ex- there's no reason we would've met otherwise even living in the same city 

564.58 565.06 A: so
