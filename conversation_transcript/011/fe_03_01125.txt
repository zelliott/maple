235.95 238.35 A: ah learning how to 

239.30 243.86 A: ah supposedly learning how to [mn] program things for giving people their benefits 

243.87 246.67 A: although as far as i was concerned it seemed to be 

247.27 248.59 A: trying to 

248.84 251.78 A: ah tell people why they weren't going to be getting their money 

252.54 259.34 A: ah it seemed that the main things that i ended up actually having to work with were the pr- were the problem cases

259.84 268.29 A: you know you've been overpaid for the last two years ah hope you don't want to eat you know [laughter] y- except of course you have to use a form letter 

268.48 269.39 A: ah 

270.15 277.13 A: i i i think they've gotten better about [mn] nicer about the way they deal with people than they used to be 

277.16 278.96 A: i certainly hope so 

279.46 280.79 A: (( ah [laughter] )) 

280.95 284.83 A: i i i lost all faith in that system then [laughter] 

280.99 283.43 B: and did you f- how how did you 

284.57 293.15 B: how did you get into that after getting a degree in philosophy rather than getting a degree in traditional social sciences yes 

293.30 296.88 A: well after getting ah after ah 

297.34 300.43 A: getting my b._a. in philosophy i 

300.48 304.36 A: decided to pursue my masters because i didn't know what else to do 

304.49 307.21 A: except that ah the 

307.27 312.56 A: ah university where i was pursuing my masters basically drummed out all love of philosophy from me 

312.81 314.82 A: so i stopped [laughter] 

315.46 316.51 A: ah 

316.82 329.26 A: and ah i considered going into teaching did took some ah education courses realized that i would be a mediocre teacher at best there's too many mediocre teachers they didn't need another one 

329.68 331.00 A: (( ah [laughter] )) 

331.60 335.46 A: and ah in trying to come up with something 

336.01 337.18 A: to do i 

337.34 339.57 A: found well at least this was something i was 

339.80 341.65 A: (( ah i )) 

341.96 347.40 A: put an application hey they actually accepted me so [laughter] that's how i got into it 

348.11 349.15 A: ah 

350.15 355.38 B: and w- i and what would you do differently in terms of 

354.67 356.07 A: (( well ac- )) 

355.41 360.87 B: what other field would you have would now in retrospect would you rather have been trained in 

360.53 362.67 A: well after i ah the 

363.07 367.86 A: day i graduated from college my father said of course i always thought you should have been an engineer 

368.30 369.23 B: [laughter] 

368.30 371.68 A: (( good timing dad [laughter] )) 

372.64 376.00 A: (( and ah couldn't have mentioned this a few years back huh )) 

377.24 378.93 A: (( and ah )) 

378.68 380.92 B: but it was your choice not his 

380.11 382.86 A: yeah well he i 

381.79 385.81 B: you followed you followed your passion and your interests at the time 

385.41 389.10 A: yeah ah my my major was 

389.18 399.17 A: technically listed as philosophy and religion because it was combined major at my college and my minor was social sciences or as i say i minored in hodgepodge 

399.76 405.92 A: ah i i basically would take any class that was something that sounded interesting that i didn't know anything about 

406.40 409.51 A: that was a mistake in chemistry but [laughter] 

409.97 414.24 A: going in to c- going into chemistry in college when you've never had any chemistry 

414.33 415.24 A: ah 

414.40 415.63 B: it's tough 

415.44 421.17 A: that's tough well i graduated a year early from high school and i skipped a year of college 

421.21 422.36 A: so that 

422.40 423.47 A: (( sort of )) 

423.86 425.51 A: made a few things a little 

425.60 427.44 A: more interesting anyway [sigh] 

428.05 433.29 B: what do you think you would take now if you had to do it all over 

436.13 437.04 A: well 

436.25 438.69 B: which field what field would you pursue 

438.88 442.54 B: that in your mind is quote unquote more useful 

443.05 445.51 A: well i might have gone into engineering 

445.52 452.04 A: then again at the time i might have gone into computer science which of course would be completely useless now because 

451.94 453.37 B: it has changed so much 

452.65 456.15 A: what what i would have studied twenty five years ago you know 

456.59 460.23 A: would have been ah archive material only now [laughter] 

456.73 457.87 B: has evolved 

461.47 462.73 A: so um 

466.61 467.92 A: (( you know [mn] )) 

468.69 469.70 A: ah 

470.29 472.75 A: i i probably would have at least you know 

473.91 474.77 A: (( well )) 

475.10 478.79 A: at the college i went to engineering would have been out but ah 

481.05 486.02 A: i i i might have i i at least might have considered the idea [laughter] 

486.18 489.17 A: you know if i if i knew then what i know now 

489.70 490.88 A: (( ah )) 

491.78 495.84 A: or considering my kids i might have looked into ah 

496.55 499.52 A: something in abnormal psychology [laughter] 

498.87 508.84 B: [laughter] i don't know if people specialize in abnormal child psychology but i'm sure some people do 

510.47 514.47 A: ah that that sounds cruel it's not meant to actually ah 

512.63 517.06 B: i know i know i know it was a joke i i took it as a joke 

516.53 524.49 A: yeah well it it's sort of a joke it's sort of serious ah my ah i have one autistic child one aspersers syndrome child 

524.16 527.16 B: i know what that is that's the functional autism 

527.23 537.41 A: it's it's it's like functional autism yeah my son is is high functional and my daughter like i say is aspersers she's much she's much more vocal more verbal than he is 

538.09 540.23 A: thank goodness but 

540.50 541.82 B: how old are they 

541.53 544.28 A: ah he's twenty one she's thirteen 

545.06 545.86 B: okay 

546.80 551.26 A: and yeah there's there's challenges in life aren't there 

551.53 554.58 B: constantly but the i guess 

555.55 559.11 B: the joy of it or supposed joy of it is 

559.29 563.36 B: how we learn from each of these things that happen 

563.47 566.87 A: yeah well one thing i learned that ah 

567.93 573.15 A: one one thing you tend to learn is that you can deal with more than you thought you could deal with 

573.31 576.49 A: ah or at least that's something that you hope you learn 

577.48 580.22 B: i guess parents have to learn that all the time 

579.64 586.47 A: oh gosh yes i still say i want my owner's manual [laughter] regarding being a parent [laughter] wasn't 

586.95 593.63 A: (( there supposed to be an instruction book or something there's one needed [laughter] )) 

595.40 599.73 A: oh well so what would you change did you come up with any 

599.01 599.89 B: um
