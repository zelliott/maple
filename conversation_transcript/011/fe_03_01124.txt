25.54 29.96 A: do something differently i don't know there's so many things [laughter] 

29.05 36.36 B: i know there are so many things i think one of the most important things i would have done is to finish college a lot younger

48.48 49.37 B: but 

49.74 54.20 B: yes i am i just wish i would have done it when i was young because 

54.24 67.28 B: when you're young you have much more energy you have fewer distractions you don't have usually don't have children and a husband and a lot of these other things and i wish i would have just gone right from high school to college got my degree and 

61.84 63.33 A: mhm 

65.80 67.62 A: did you did you take off time 

67.61 68.63 B: i'm sorry

88.48 91.66 A: well that's good so you wish you would have done it earlier though 

89.36 90.41 B: (( how about )) 

91.23 92.17 B: yes 

92.42 94.69 A: before not as many things were going on

97.97 99.06 B: how about you 

101.46 103.86 A: so that's not i think 

104.31 108.41 A: if i could go back into time i would have not had children so soon 

108.97 109.91 B: yes 

109.06 113.68 A: i think i would have wanted to be married longer before i started a family 

113.93 115.72 B: (( and why is that )) 

115.35 118.00 A: well i just because 

119.82 127.81 A: it's fun being a mom and stuff but i wish i could have pursued my e- my education i guess more and pursued my career more 

128.04 138.67 A: and you know i i'm at a point now in my life where i can go out and work and stuff and i like it a lot more and i wish i would have i don't know i wish i would have waited a couple more years before i started a family 

138.76 142.56 B: because going to work is a lot easier than staying home with kids isn't it 

141.95 143.04 A: it is 

142.64 145.30 B: [laughter] i know i 

143.46 146.21 A: [laughter] isn't that terrible [laughter] 

145.31 149.80 B: well no i understand i have three children two are grown 

149.92 153.41 B: and married and i'm going to be a grandmother 

153.34 154.32 A: (( oh wow ))

158.10 159.06 A: (( mm yeah )) 

158.73 159.66 B: so 

159.94 166.68 B: i do understand and even though i like staying home and and being a mom and a 

166.31 169.26 A: oh so do i i love my daughter but 

169.26 174.01 B: but you do you do miss out on those things you know and i- it 

171.52 172.40 A: mhm 

173.12 179.70 A: and i wish i would have waited you know we we waited about a year and a half before we had children but i wish i would have waited longer 

180.33 184.05 A: just to make sure we could you know just to 

185.33 188.45 A: make my situation better than it is i guess 

188.25 189.92 B: what type of work do you do 

189.63 193.04 A: um well i just do a lot of different things 

193.17 194.14 A: um 

194.84 200.11 A: i right now i'm just working for my husband's company i'm doing like secretarial jobs and stuff like that 

196.91 197.76 B: (( mm )) 

199.72 201.77 B: well that's nice though i mean 

201.38 209.54 A: it is but it's not what i would have picked if i ha- you know it's not my major n- at school and stuff so 

209.20 212.02 B: what do you think you would have d- been doing been doing 

211.03 217.12 A: um i actually probably would have wanted to be an editor of a book of like a or a newspaper 

217.01 218.35 B: oh 

217.25 218.30 A: (( and so )) 

218.38 222.04 A: that would have been my first because i love to do that sort of thing so 

221.65 224.80 B: do you have a degree in journalism or communications or 

224.12 228.70 A: yeah communications and then i i also have it in teaching so i don't know 

228.04 230.44 B: do you really that's what i'm getting my degree in 

230.21 232.23 A: yeah so 

231.22 232.32 B: yeah 

232.38 236.22 B: well you know though the great thing about being an editor 

236.41 244.77 B: you can do that because you know with the computers and everything today you don't have to leave your house like you did before 

244.30 249.38 A: mhm that's true and the job i have now is actually pretty fun that way 

244.94 246.43 B: you know and i think 

249.47 254.19 A: i get you know all the paperwork and and i guess and i also do 

254.24 256.57 A: i don't know if you do secret shopping 

256.82 258.73 B: well you know i 

259.01 264.70 B: it just i haven't really had time up until now i have a i also have a part time job which most 

263.63 264.44 A: (( uh-huh )) 

264.70 276.06 B: most of it i can do at home i go into the office when my daughter's at school and kind of get pick up my work and kind of um come home and do it and that's not necessarily every day but it's it's nice and 

269.06 270.05 A: yeah 

276.79 287.25 B: i'm g- i'm i haven't done it yet i don't know why i've signed up i belong to money and shopping or whatever that homeworking mom 

283.71 284.65 A: mhm 

286.72 287.70 A: (( mhm )) 

287.30 288.67 B: i've belonged for 

288.77 290.43 B: maybe nine months now 

290.13 291.27 A: oh really 

290.64 293.72 B: and i've never done it ha- do you do it quite a bit 

293.07 307.58 A: yeah that well that's why i can do because all my kids are still really young and none of them have g- even gone to school yet and my husband wants more and i'm just like well no [laughter] because i just i would rather i mean he doesn't know what it's like to stay home and 

298.54 299.57 B: oh 

302.52 303.98 B: [laughter] 

307.76 310.55 A: stop your life to raise your children and so 

310.81 318.62 B: and you know what they never will know my husband has he is forty seven and he has no clue he thinks i eat bon bons all day 

313.52 315.78 A: i know and i don't expect him to 

316.48 317.43 A: [laughter] 

318.72 321.96 A: my husband's twenty seven and he still doesn't know well he doesn't know yet though 

320.86 326.54 B: [laughter] they they never know you know and and that's i guess 

321.98 323.77 A: [laughter] 

327.11 329.59 B: okay because they have to focus on 

329.23 330.29 A: mhm 

329.63 332.29 B: different things you know than than we do but 

330.92 331.57 A: (( yeah )) 

331.94 333.08 A: and that's fine 

332.88 334.14 B: yeah 

333.79 347.17 A: that's good i just he wants to have more kids and i'm i'm to a point where my all my kids are old enough now where i don't have to take care of them like you know they're not infants anymore and so it's it's easier to take them to the babysitter for a day while i get something done 

334.42 335.47 B: but 

341.84 342.81 B: right 

347.14 348.18 B: right 

347.58 354.46 A: whereas if i had an infant i would have to stay home and that's that's probably why if i could go back in my life 

354.47 361.39 A: i would not have kids so soon so i could get all this done that i wanted to before i started my family and where i could feel like 

361.69 364.97 A: i was ready now to be you know to do that with my life 

363.44 367.93 B: right where you satis- you would have satisfied that other part of your life 

365.90 366.95 A: yeah 

367.25 368.74 A: exactly 

368.12 371.97 B: yeah i know i i like i said i too had children very young and i 

371.98 380.03 B: all of my whole life i wanted to be a doctor my entire life there was really nothing i ever wanted to do besides that and 

374.48 375.46 A: mhm 

380.34 382.22 B: you know i i guess 

382.60 384.58 A: well have you ever thought about nursing school 

384.56 396.95 B: you know i went to i took some nursing classes and at this point in my life physically it was very hard lifting the patients and it was it was really kind of too hard for me 

396.58 397.73 A: mhm 

397.08 398.22 B: and 

399.53 405.25 B: you know i just i don't think that at this point in my life it's a time to begin that 

404.97 405.87 A: okay 

405.40 412.22 B: you know ah i have some friends that are nurses and you know they've already passed that they've already passed when 

406.24 406.99 A: yeah 

410.91 411.72 A: mhm 

412.30 416.03 B: when they were young and they got their nursing degrees and 

416.66 425.15 B: they did that you're younger and stronger and you get a little bit older and it's it's not as easy you know physically even though we're not old and ancient 

419.23 420.12 A: mhm 

425.00 432.23 B: you don't have the same stamina and strength so and i know i lifted a patient and twisted he was a big guy and 

427.62 428.51 A: mhm 

432.54 439.95 B: um just dead weight you know he couldn't help himself and i twisted my back and then 

434.45 436.37 A: [noise] mhm well that's what it is 

438.42 439.51 A: (( oh dear )) 

439.94 448.22 B: nothing serious you know it went away in a few weeks i was okay but i thought hm i don't know if this is such a especially with a little one at home 

447.87 449.64 A: (( yeah your five year old )) 

449.01 451.57 B: yeah we're ah yeah i kind of have to 

450.92 453.32 A: yeah that's how i i know how you feel 

453.33 457.60 B: but you know what i've decided to do is to substitute teach 

457.46 458.86 A: that could be good 

458.43 460.46 B: yeah so that way i can 

460.23 464.24 A: and your husband is still around and so 

462.53 463.66 B: right

478.21 479.09 B: um 

479.26 483.27 B: things like that and i'll still be available to her but at least i'll 

483.48 495.26 B: be making a little bit of money and getting out of the house and talking to adults [laughter] once in a while [laughter] [laughter] you know 

485.54 486.48 A: mhm
