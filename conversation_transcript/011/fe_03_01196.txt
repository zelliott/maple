110.46 112.02 B: (( [laughter] yeah i know )) 

115.42 119.43 A: mean i i mean i i just don't think a million dollars is worth it 

119.77 123.22 A: a best friend's friendship [laughter] that's all i could s- 

121.80 123.09 B: yeah it kind 

123.41 126.70 B: it kind of reminds me of that movie indecent proposal 

126.52 127.78 A: yeah 

127.26 128.75 B: yeah and that's like 

129.03 132.07 B: kind of it reminds me of that a little bit 

133.79 141.44 B: or like that one movie where that guy won the lottery and um he was married to his wife or something and he had to give half to that lady who was a waitress 

142.22 143.91 A: i never saw that movie 

143.71 144.99 B: but i um 

145.49 147.41 B: it was called it could happen to you

149.09 152.11 A: i i remember seeing the previews to it but i've never seen it 

151.83 159.90 B: yeah i think he had broken up with his wife and then he had to give that lady the waitress half of 'cause he made the promise and he didn't want to go back on his promise 

160.23 161.20 A: yeah 

172.48 174.94 B: so what are we supposed to do do we just stay on the phone

184.12 185.89 B: oh what what does that mean 

186.05 194.53 A: i don't know [laughter] i i guess maybe after the ten minutes we get disconnected and then it like maybe it asks you some other questions 

194.61 195.50 B: oh
