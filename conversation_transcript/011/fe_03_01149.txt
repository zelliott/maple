511.88 512.93 A: uh-huh 

512.57 522.87 B: when we were dating he he says like oh yeah it sounds like a great dream but then we it came down to me getting that scholarship and going then it was like no you can't do that 

522.87 529.92 B: and ah i don't know i think just a little resentment there just that the relationship fell apart

536.56 540.04 B: and we got married and had a child and everything so 

540.05 550.93 B: if i wouldn't have broken up with him i probably would have married him never would have gone back to the old boyfriend and married him and had my daughter so in a way you know 

550.78 556.15 B: part of me regrets that i didn't fulfill the dream but then another part i wouldn't have the
