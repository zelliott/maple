359.76 360.66 B: uh-huh 

361.13 362.02 B: uh-huh 

363.03 368.48 B: that's what everybody says when they go to college they go for one thing and they don't end up 

368.26 375.09 A: yeah i'm going to tell you what you do you go to college for something you like to do if you're a writer you like to write you go to do that 

374.72 375.78 B: (( mhm )) 

375.00 389.82 A: don't go to do something practical that you ain't going to like trust me because you end up in a job that you just can't stand and then one day you just snap and tell folks if they don't get out your office you're going to break their necks 

378.46 379.82 B: yeah 

386.98 389.91 B: [laughter] 

390.15 392.12 B: [laughter] that's true 

392.00 400.39 A: yeah because you just going to snap i mean there was plenty of time i t- one day i was in a in this one office it was a big office with the cubicles 

400.25 410.73 A: i pulled a desk and a chair it was actually a table and a chair and hooked up the phone line pulled it right on out the wall and put myself in the closet because those folks was plucking my nerves 

403.97 404.94 B: mhm 

410.38 412.24 B: yeah 

410.92 418.43 A: yacking me to death about stuff i don't care who you screwing this week it does not make a difference because you're not paying no rent at my house 

418.55 419.96 A: i don't care 

419.61 420.67 B: right 

420.39 423.97 A: you know it they was just plucking my nerves i couldn't take it 

423.39 426.53 B: yeah that's a bad thing too about being in the 

426.79 430.16 B: work world you've got to put up with all that stuff but 

429.59 431.13 A: mhm 

430.88 434.06 B: but you know like i said sometimes i think 

432.41 437.68 A: but i mean then again you still around adults all day of course half the time you're around crazy folks 

437.25 438.36 B: right 

438.01 452.36 A: so i mean but find out what you like to do whatever you like to do because if i had a chance b- if i could do it over i would go to college for art i like doing art i like doing all kinds of art art things and i would go for that 

447.87 449.06 B: (( mhm )) 

452.13 453.11 B: right 

452.47 454.44 A: i wouldn't go for something i 

454.80 461.27 A: i it wouldn't be because it really doesn't make a difference because it doesn't matter what you get your degree in anyway you're going to end up working somewhere 

461.28 466.06 A: whatever i w- i was an engineer and i ended up working with people that had 

462.25 463.48 B: well do you think that 

466.27 470.37 A: english degrees and history degrees it didn't matter 

467.63 469.54 B: mhm 

470.13 475.92 B: right so do you think though it made a difference in your pay though for going to college 

470.98 472.81 A: we were all engineers 

474.58 481.61 A: oh no yes yes yes it made a huge difference in my pay but it didn't matter what i did it just mattered that i had a degree 

477.66 479.19 B: right 

481.31 483.37 B: right 

482.22 483.96 A: do you understand what i'm saying 

483.52 484.98 B: yeah 

484.40 491.66 A: like that so you just get your degree in something you like you like basket weaving you just weave yourself some baskets 

491.05 496.62 B: yeah [laughter] that's true because if you don't like your job what's the point huh 

496.17 502.14 A: right exactly i mean because whenever you because when you go into college y- i mean it's such a good time 

501.87 502.93 B: mhm 

502.22 509.39 A: you're having i mean it is it is an awesome time you have a good time you meet good folks and things people are just great 

506.66 508.51 B: mhm 

508.94 510.69 B: what age did you go 

509.53 510.57 A: (( then you can )) 

511.15 513.34 A: w- when when did i go 

512.56 514.10 B: what age 

513.70 518.92 A: oh what age i went when i was twenty one and i was two years older than everybody else 

516.09 517.31 B: you did 

518.63 519.80 B: right 

518.98 533.23 A: but um it didn't matter it was still one big party it doesn't matter it was still one big party yeah you can go you'd just become you'd be partying it up even more you going to be legal i mean it was just one big party didn't matter we had all kinds of folk 

519.90 521.93 B: boy and can you imagine me going 

522.25 524.07 B: can you imagine me going 

527.90 529.30 B: [laughter] 

533.27 541.69 B: yeah well in my thirties i don't know that's scary too going back to college with all the young ones 

534.84 536.59 A: everywhere and things 

539.00 540.69 A: mhm 

541.35 546.62 A: that ain't got nothing to do with it because they you got an edge on them you know how to go to the library 

546.31 547.44 B: right 

546.61 559.78 A: most of these young folks they think the internet has everything but you can't trust the internet for all your information you have to actually go physically and look it up plus you already know being older to don't let your pride get in the way 

551.30 552.46 B: right 

559.39 560.60 B: (( mhm )) 

559.77 570.89 A: if you are getting ready to make a c. or fail a class you know you need to get your butt in that professor's office and start sucking up and asking for extra help you know whereas 

563.76 564.71 B: mhm 

568.79 570.40 B: right 

571.18 574.96 A: flunk out they don't care you don't have time to be wasting money like that 

574.46 577.41 B: no sure don't 

575.75 588.23 A: see what i'm saying that's what and that's what made a big difference i went a few years where i didn't have time or money to be wasting like that i went ahead and you know whatever they were doing and they the professors if you're nice to them you talk to them 

582.10 583.46 B: yeah 

588.03 589.90 B: mhm 

588.20 591.38 A: they will make sure you pass their class because 

590.39 597.28 B: right well that's good yeah well that good advice 

591.99 594.47 A: they know who's working and who's not 

597.66 599.95 B: so maybe i can find something on
