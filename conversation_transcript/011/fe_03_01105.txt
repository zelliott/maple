6.95 8.38 A: i think something that i'd change back 

8.90 11.69 A: from when i was younger um i got in to like um 

12.16 13.05 A: prostitution 

13.78 14.51 A: and 

15.01 16.73 A: now that i look back and see 

17.10 18.81 A: all the things that happened and 

19.38 21.35 A: all that (( i )) think i would change that because 

21.75 23.88 A: no it's not the life to live you know you can 

24.25 31.89 A: you can you can do something better with yourself as in putting yourself out there like there and i mean i learned a lot and i'm dating somebody know who 

32.09 33.65 A: who teaches me about all that 

34.01 39.87 A: and i'm glad that um you know god found a way for me to get up out of there you know i was living there anywhere and everywhere just to 

40.38 42.07 A: have somewhere to put my head at you know 

42.30 44.21 A: doing whatever i had to do to get money 

44.68 50.14 A: and now that i look back i i feel good -cause i'm doing something for myself i'm positive i'm working 

50.52 51.83 A: um just (( i )) graduated 

52.23 53.41 A: you know things like that 

54.79 56.40 B: well 

56.61 64.30 B: you did a good job thinking about that because you know when they said that um we were supposed to talk about time travel i'm thinking oh well 

62.13 62.47 A: mhm 

81.56 85.48 B: i can think of a lot of different things and usually it did involve men 

86.05 88.03 B: um something along those lines 

88.53 91.59 B: i think one of the big mistakes i made was um 

110.26 113.64 B: because if i had stayed working 

113.81 115.89 B: if i had um 

117.19 118.73 B: you know i don't know 

119.41 120.06 B: um 

120.94 126.28 B: maintained some kind of working outside of the house instead of staying home with my son 

126.42 137.22 B: which i thought we were supposed to do you know i thought i was doing all the things i was supposed to do right i'm cooking and cleaning and you know i thought i was just doing all things that i was supposed to do and so here we are 

137.35 147.15 B: several years down the road and it seems like i'm being penalized or i'm it's like it was a big mistake because now i don't have any recent job skills 

147.65 148.67 B: that i can market 

149.31 156.31 B: than i really think that that's what i would change i think that yeah i think that that's what i would change i would not have stayed home 

157.67 158.92 B: with my son 

159.20 160.09 B: like i did 

160.58 163.86 B: but then on the other hand you miss all those special times i don't know 
164.36 176.03 A: yeah i i kind of figure right there -cause like when i was back there after doing that you know i look back and now i try to go i try to go and um draw unemployment today and they was like you can't do it because you have to be on your job you have to be 

176.77 179.33 A: doing something within twelve months and i only had one job 

179.47 183.25 A: and which was only three months so it just kind of messed me up there 

183.56 184.32 B: right 

184.62 185.24 A: so it's like 

185.79 187.00 A: see if i could get a job where 

187.41 194.28 A: whatever you know my boyfriend he's putting me through things talking about well if you want to be with me you got to get a job because he has a lot of bills and i stay with him 

194.81 198.55 A: and i'm not with the house maid stuff i can't sit at home all day and just be bored 

198.66 199.08 A: it gets 

198.75 199.60 B: no 

200.18 208.68 B: no you got to go out and look for trouble and look for some fun you know another thing i think i would change is um 

202.33 203.02 A: okay 

209.45 216.76 B: oh darn i just had something in my head what the heck was it oh this is a biggie i would not 

217.01 217.39 B: have 

217.56 218.22 B: ever 

218.35 225.77 B: ever started smoking because i am trying so hard to stop smoking and you know it is 

239.89 242.26 B: go back and do all over again i would never 

243.65 246.64 B: mean i did a lot of other things as well and s- 

246.75 248.20 B: i used to tell people well 

255.32 264.48 B: that was then and this is now and here i am years and years and years later and it's just so difficult to stop smoking and i have stopped smoking 

264.95 265.61 B: but 

266.28 267.36 B: you know it's like 

267.66 268.29 B: it never 

268.44 270.11 B: goes away a hundred percent 

271.46 274.07 B: you know it just never does how about you do you smoke 

274.23 274.84 A: no 

275.20 276.20 B: you never started 

276.28 280.00 A: i mean i i tried it but i've always like had problems with the inhaling part 

280.09 283.21 A: i would know how i mean i don't know how to inhale i just like 

283.37 284.96 A: breath it in and then blow it out my nose 

285.82 288.49 B: well that's a good thing not to know how to do i'll tell you 

286.02 286.32 A: so 

289.19 290.37 B: i wish i didn't 

290.78 294.98 A: so i mean my (( )) will be like here light the cigarette smoke smoke it will make you feel better 

295.81 299.40 A: but so i i don't know i don't know how to inhale that's enough right there 

298.74 300.40 B: so it just didn't work for you 

300.29 300.86 A: uh hm 

300.66 306.84 B: oh you are so lucky because you know you could be uh -cause it's it's terrible for you i mean 

306.98 310.03 A: -cause i i i could probably wouldn't be able to control my habit i'm cheap 

310.48 315.94 A: i don't believe in giving two dollars every two weeks so (( )) every every couple of days for cigarettes is two dollars and some change 

316.37 317.50 B: right 

317.15 317.59 A: okay 

317.61 319.40 B: well you know um 

319.56 321.12 B: this is true and now they are like 

321.48 327.55 B: three dollars and a pack and uh but in certain places like canada they are um 

322.75 323.19 A: yeah 

329.05 331.16 B: uh seven eight dollars a pack 

331.01 333.66 A: yeah i know newports are five dollars in new york 

334.10 335.17 B: well that's ridiculous 

335.29 337.84 B: i'm in greenville south carolina where are you 

337.85 339.05 A: i'm in atlanta georgia 

339.12 344.71 B: oh atlanta atlanta is a great place i have a friend who lives there and i go there sometimes

347.19 347.91 B: oh do you 

348.68 349.48 B: what does that mean 

349.56 350.13 A: uh 

350.31 350.69 A: mhm 

350.77 354.49 B: does that mean that we've talked for eight we're we're supposed to talk for what eight minutes 

354.28 355.71 A: it said ten minutes on the paper 

355.94 360.86 B: yeah ten minutes how did you find out well did we talk about time travel long enough 

356.90 357.40 A: yeah 

361.02 364.99 A: well you know i'm going to say one more thing 

364.03 367.37 B: uh l- okay what would you go back and change in history 

367.56 368.57 B: think about that 

369.17 373.19 B: if you could change anything what would you go back and change in history 

373.55 376.62 A: in history itself i'd probably change um 

374.75 375.27 B: yeah 

378.03 379.54 A: martin luther king's death 

380.06 380.90 B: yeah 

381.32 387.13 A: i mean -cause he was there he was always out for a lot of people i won't say malcolm x. -cause he was kind of a crime fighter and all of that but 

386.69 387.15 B: who 

387.28 391.29 A: malcolm x. i believe wasn't in to all of his his motives and stuff but 

388.10 388.58 B: right 

390.90 391.77 B: right 

391.43 398.07 A: he was like the white men i won't b- bother that you know and um martin luther king he was always there for equal people and equal opportunities so 

397.81 398.63 B: right 

398.35 399.66 A: i i think i would change 

399.26 399.64 B: or 

399.78 405.28 B: or you know if you if you changed that there was ever any slavery then you wouldn't need to 

405.23 406.10 A: yeah yeah 

405.80 408.51 B: even i mean he he wouldn't have even had a mission 

408.63 409.68 B: um 

408.79 409.26 A: right 

410.28 416.53 B: but well that would be a good thing to change that would that would change things for a lot of people and 

416.53 418.67 A: and it probably things wouldn't even be the way that they are now 

418.49 424.13 B: that's right and maybe there would be less hatred and less um animosity towards each other 

423.06 425.78 A: another change i would change is not putting bush 

425.99 427.52 A: in the presidency 

428.02 428.49 A: oh 

428.67 429.23 A: (( )) 

428.73 430.78 B: right the little bush 

431.21 432.06 B: i don't like him 

431.86 437.10 A: i don't i don't either he's just he's just trying to leave leave off he's uh starting off where his dad left off at 

437.48 443.90 B: well i don't even th- i don't think he's very smart and i and you know i liked his dad 

443.90 444.26 A: mhm 

444.34 444.99 B: um 

445.54 454.87 B: it i mean he made uh he looked so much better once we got clinton in there and he started messing around you know acting like a sociopath but um 

452.07 452.41 A: hm 

454.97 458.11 B: yeah that would be a good plan not to put him in charge 

458.83 463.56 B: uh and also i would i would like to change if i could go back in time 

463.50 463.82 A: mhm 

465.40 467.07 B: i don't know what i'd do but i'd 

467.17 469.18 B: change something about um 

469.29 470.60 B: what happened 

470.83 474.20 B: uh to the twin towers because that was just that was 

472.37 472.91 A: yeah 

473.70 475.34 A: they knew it was going to happen though 

475.85 481.75 A: they got letters in the mail but bush was like yo ain't nothing going to happen and then when it happened i was like he was looking all silly 

483.30 483.78 B: hm 

484.01 484.68 B: really 

484.52 488.57 A: yeah they said that on c._n._n. they got letters about it and just he just looked over it 

496.88 504.12 B: people we'll never know what's really happening they will never know the real story -cause we only know what they want us to know 

504.34 505.14 A: yeah like they wa- 

504.61 513.48 B: and that is uh so aggravating -cause we -cause you know that's one reason that i have a hard time getting really excited about politics and talking about 

513.76 522.38 B: you know um we should have done this and we should have done this and or or that because i don't really think that we know that we have any idea what the real deal is
