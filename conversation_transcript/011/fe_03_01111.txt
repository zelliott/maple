130.96 131.34 A: yeah 

131.81 132.33 A: um

134.58 135.29 A: major 

135.79 138.12 B: you know i'd be too afraid that i would change the course of my life 

135.88 136.55 A: definitely

148.66 149.19 B: right 

150.15 151.82 B: so i'd be afraid to change anything major

152.21 152.59 A: yeah 

153.11 153.41 A: yeah

182.96 183.27 A: oh 

183.38 183.74 A: huh 

184.13 188.12 A: wow i'm surprised we're warmer than california that probably doesn't happen too often 

188.75 191.69 B: no probably not i'm surprised it's that warm there i thought it snowed 

191.10 191.42 A: yeah 

192.20 193.40 A: yeah uh it's it s- 

193.49 195.92 A: it was snowing like crazy a week ago and now 

196.74 199.75 A: now it's really really nice but we're actually on spring break um 

201.19 202.89 B: that's a great time to have nice weather 

203.25 203.64 A: yeah 

203.78 204.15 A: yeah 

205.72 207.04 B: how long does this last 

207.36 207.91 A: i think 

208.44 209.62 A: ten minutes 

210.08 212.31 B: so we just sit here for ten minutes and talk about time travel 

210.58 210.93 A: oh 

212.55 221.41 A: i gu- apparently yeah i don't ah understand if they if they actually expect us to talk about their topic for ten minutes because i don't think i have that much to say about it 

212.74 213.35 B: our time 

221.32 222.19 B: yeah i don't either 

222.64 223.41 A: okay well 

223.62 224.23 A: i guess w- 

224.64 226.77 A: keep waiting until the ten minutes are up 

227.56 231.56 A: i think i think it said in the email that it just after ten minutes it says good bye 

232.29 232.62 A: so 

232.58 233.67 B: and then we just hang up 

234.18 236.05 A: i guess i think that little that 

236.73 238.46 A: automatic voice is going to say 

239.40 242.19 A: that the conversation is over or something and then we're done 

243.06 244.78 B: yeah this is the first time (( i'm doing )) it so 

243.72 243.98 A: um 

244.66 247.38 A: yeah yeah me too and then we're suppose to get two more i think 

247.82 248.78 A: i don't know i k- i 

248.01 248.50 B: (( )) 

249.25 250.73 A: (( )) no not today i think 

250.87 253.28 A: sometime i don't know i remem- i signed up for this thing like 

253.44 257.16 A: two or three weeks ago i'd completely forgotten about it until i got this call (( )) you know 

257.16 259.56 B: i signed up for it a couple months ago 

259.11 259.42 A: huh 

260.13 262.16 A: yeah i don't i think (( )) 

262.36 263.99 A: who knows it might be awhile before we 

264.19 265.93 A: get another one but i think they're suppose to 

266.64 270.20 A: i think they're suppose to do three of them and then give you thirty bucks or something 

272.86 273.36 A: i don't know 

275.04 276.00 A: kind of a strange 

276.24 276.96 A: study 

283.86 284.59 B: (( )) 

284.96 286.29 B: i h- i wonder if they're recording us 

287.03 287.41 A: what 

287.79 289.19 B: i said i wonder if they're recording us 

289.05 289.40 A: oh 

289.50 291.62 A: i think they are i think i'm pretty sure 

290.82 291.37 B: oh great 

292.50 293.51 A: yeah 

292.73 294.06 B: well we haven't had said a whole lot 

294.38 295.34 B: whole lot about um 

295.74 296.62 B: changing things 

296.97 298.29 B: they're not going to get a very interesting 

299.32 300.47 B: conversation out of us 

301.62 303.82 A: i'm guessing they probably want to look more at 

305.05 305.61 A: just like 

305.81 308.81 A: y- how you like interact with people (( )) 

309.20 310.79 A: i just got call waiting but i'll ignore it

314.39 315.45 A: people like interact 

315.68 318.30 A: wh- that uh haven't talked to each other before or something 

319.27 321.24 A: because i don't know what they'd want to actually look at about 

321.86 322.63 A: each topic 

322.03 324.77 B: i don't either but if they want to do that they could just go to a. o. l. chat room 

325.04 325.35 A: yeah 

325.57 326.88 A: just 

326.94 327.36 B: (( ))
