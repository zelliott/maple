34.67 36.22 B: oh yeah 

36.60 42.19 B: yeah i definitely do ah the one thing the one regret i have in life is that um 

38.37 39.25 A: (( okay )) 

42.27 48.42 B: that i i worked really really hard to get myself through um to to a point 

48.41 49.46 B: um 

49.05 50.04 A: (( [noise] ))

66.37 76.47 B: in the last two when i transferred to a four year university um i graduated but i didn't really give it my all 

76.57 87.40 B: and so i i really i i have really regretted since then that i didn't um take more opportunities that came up for me and get more 

76.78 78.19 A: (( uh-huh ooh )) 

87.76 94.06 B: involved in my academics and so um so that's always been kind of a regret for me 

90.16 91.09 A: uh-huh 

94.36 97.94 B: or ah if i could go back and do it over i'd do it differently 

97.87 98.86 A: yeah 

98.46 99.68 B: [laughter] 

100.22 102.21 A: well what is 

102.14 113.92 A: not so much a regret is i've always wished that i had a second life almost because i'm fifty plus i have five kids i've got a great professional job and whatever but 

113.86 117.18 A: ever since i was little i wanted to be a pediatrician 

117.11 117.96 B: oh 

117.28 126.24 A: and by the time i was in the end of highschool i still wanted to be a pediatrician and i'd won a bunch of awards and whatever went on to college and um 

126.47 135.53 A: about the second year in college i kind've looked around and went oh if i wanted to be a mum of a large family which i did 

135.17 136.06 B: uh-huh 

135.84 144.79 A: and a pediatrician this isn't going to work [laughter] so you know i mean you can't do both of them they take lots and lots of time 

144.34 145.54 B: right 

145.18 151.30 A: so um i ultimately i did so i have five children and which was great 

145.98 147.94 B: so you made the choice [laughter] 

151.32 155.36 A: and i've been a pediatric physical therapist for years but 

154.61 157.02 B: oh that's pretty darn close mhm 

156.33 161.83 A: it is close but in the back of my mind if i had another life i always 

162.39 170.17 A: i still would like to do that you know it'll never happen but it's one of those gosh it would've been set [laughter] 

167.76 168.91 B: yeah yeah 

169.26 173.63 B: yeah so you wouldn't go back to school to do that at this point in your life 

170.46 171.26 A: no 

173.10 177.95 A: no i already got a masters degree and other stuff and it's just like i've been to school 

178.65 179.70 B: yeah 

178.96 180.00 A: (( and ah )) 

179.72 181.19 B: you're done [laughter] 

180.64 184.80 A: i'm done with that yeah and and i wouldn't trade the kids away for anything 

184.52 185.92 B: [laughter] yeah 

184.89 187.49 A: so the choice i made was right 

187.23 188.17 B: uh-huh 

187.85 190.44 A: but it's just one of those if i had 

190.75 197.07 A: if i had another chance someway i would still have loved to have done that and maybe in my next life i don't 

197.32 198.45 B: right 

198.46 199.56 A: (( know )) 

198.70 201.33 B: why not [laughter]

203.90 205.47 B: so what happens now 

205.62 210.99 A: oh we have to keep talking until ten minutes is up and then it then beeps 'cause it keeps recording 

210.81 222.99 A: our voices and our inflections because it's trying to figure out sound voice patterns so that they can create a something or other with ah the average voice pattern whatever that is 

222.27 225.40 B: oh is that right i think 

223.47 227.99 A: uh-huh yeah it's a research study out of the university of pennsylvania apparently

263.99 264.84 B: uh-huh 

269.09 283.54 A: who are looking for certain service items so you go in looking for a blouse or whatever and you know approach the little sales lady and ask her if she can take you to pink blouses and and then you grade them 

283.50 291.15 A: more or less on their service later and then the company pays you that's a secret shopper and so they um 

289.06 290.50 B: oh interesting

318.92 328.70 A: like ten bucks you know so i that's how i signed up was 'cause they i heard about it and they it's been a couple of months i think since i ah initially did

402.71 404.67 A: up front except i knew 

404.59 419.09 A: my daughter worked at staples for a long time and they had these people that came in and and bought stuff in their store and then assessed all of the customer service and sent back a report so i knew it was for real because she had been assessed that way 

418.80 419.74 B: uh-huh 

419.63 424.55 A: so anyway i found a a site on line made a searcy- searching

427.44 434.53 A: signed up at i don't know a dozen or so sites and i've been getting emails off line for about a year and a half i guess 

432.08 434.71 B: wow do you do you recommend

451.55 452.43 B: uh-huh 

455.24 465.98 A: you don't have to go to everybody's website she has them all categorized off of hers so instead of you doing the hunting you use her page as the jump point to go 

460.66 461.71 B: (( i see )) 

465.99 479.41 A: hunt or get registered so i think i paid twenty or twenty five dollars something to register register there initially but it was worth it to me for all of her resources and all of her connections and and uh 

473.40 474.20 B: uh-huh 

479.77 487.49 A: just generic support and to get on her email list because as soon as you sign up then she starts sending

491.26 493.27 A: about um 

494.94 502.49 A: opportunities at at different companies and then once you start you get a couple of jobs you can um 

502.55 509.50 A: a company finds out if you're reliable or whatever and then they'll send you more you you always have the opportunity to say 

509.38 518.25 A: no you know this isn't for me i can't do it i'm too busy or whatever or you could accept as many as you want to bet that you could actually go do 

511.79 513.13 B: interesting 

518.06 520.04 B: (( and ah what do you get paid )) 

518.40 522.25 A: so they pay you i don't know ten fifteen bucks a a job 

521.96 522.93 B: (( uh-huh [mn] ))
