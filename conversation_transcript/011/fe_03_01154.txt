18.03 25.86 A: okay um well our hypothetical question of the day is time travel and if you have the opportunity to go back and change something 

26.38 27.51 A: uh in the past 

27.98 29.86 A: what would it be and why 

30.76 31.65 A: um let's 

31.81 32.14 A: see 

32.75 39.08 A: i think i would like to go back and change something that happened about uh 

39.40 41.79 A: uh ten twelve years ago 

42.18 42.75 B: what was that 

42.92 44.91 A: it was the death of my father 

46.14 49.65 A: um my father was a huge influence on my life 

50.41 51.41 A: uh and 

51.56 52.75 A: i miss him greatly 

53.39 59.85 A: and i have missed his guidance and his uh advice and his influence on my life 

60.35 65.82 A: and if there is one thing that i could change in my life now it would be that i would have my father back 

68.10 73.62 B: i i agree uh i would do something uh similar pertaining to my father as well 

74.24 77.73 B: i would uh have kept uh my parents from divorcing 

78.40 79.12 B: um 

79.48 80.31 B: that has had a 

80.60 85.10 B: an unbelievable amount of magnitude on my life uh causing me to go through 
85.53 96.37 B: all all kinds of problems uh for the for the next ten years it was just impossible i mean i became estranged from my mother and my father and uh 

88.48 89.40 A: heartache 

97.27 101.29 B: god it was just absolutely detrimental to my self esteem uh 

101.78 105.80 B: causing me to uh like criminal activities and all kind of other just 

106.10 108.73 B: stupid stuff that a teenager would do 

109.57 114.22 B: and uh i wish i could have i could go back and change that and make my world perfect again 

115.28 122.94 A: and it is strange that that events like this happen in our lives and they send us down a path that somehow 

123.09 126.39 A: you would have never chosen had you had a choice 

127.13 129.43 A: but it seems like sometimes it opens up 

130.16 134.27 A: uh it opens up avenues in our life that we never even knew that were there 

134.49 144.62 B: i absolutely agree like uh for some reason i feel like uh it worked out for the best i'm not sure uh if i would be happy with the person that i would become if everything uh if i wasn't 

144.75 148.28 B: uh you know in the crucible of those trials and i'm 

147.81 148.27 A: true 

148.41 151.34 B: i'm very happy with who i have become and 

151.53 156.92 B: uh without those past events uh it wouldn't lead me down this path but i don't know 

157.11 161.84 B: i think it is funny how everything just seems to work out for most folks 
161.64 164.18 A: well you know what i think that i think that 

164.39 167.51 A: that determines the medal of a person 

167.97 168.68 A: is not 

169.20 171.26 A: the hardships that happened to you 

171.85 174.30 A: but how you handle them and how you get up 

174.56 176.33 A: and how you go on afterward 

177.12 177.86 A: -cause i mean 

178.05 182.07 A: i have seen people in in our similar positions 

182.24 182.95 A: who have 

184.01 185.88 A: gone a completely different direction 

186.44 187.08 A: and 

187.23 188.29 A: never came out of it 

188.60 192.45 A: they went into a tailspin and went down down down from there 

193.08 194.17 A: so i mean it it's 

194.84 195.41 A: so 

195.85 196.62 A: easy 

196.99 198.80 A: for a one choice in life 

199.32 200.15 A: to be made 

200.86 202.40 A: and you can never recover from it 

203.01 203.38 B: that's 

203.48 213.95 B: that's i absolutely agree with that statement it makes me want to be more cautious with the uh decisions that i make knowing how they might effect uh possible futures but 

214.06 214.60 B: being that i 

214.06 215.22 A: let me ask you this 

215.68 215.93 A: since 

216.21 218.29 A: since it was a divorce that really 

218.50 219.95 A: traumatized your life 

220.15 221.72 A: how do you feel about divorce 

223.11 223.87 B: well 

224.09 232.88 B: if it can be avoided altogether that would be great but we have an increasing uh divorce rate especially here in america i mean i think it is uh like fifty fifty right now that 

233.29 235.92 B: most couples are getting together and then getting divorced uh 

236.43 239.06 B: in uh less than ten years and 

245.30 246.81 B: go through with a uh 

246.92 256.99 B: as an adolescent that is just very scary because i imagine a lot of people uh aren't going to take it as well as i did and that this will uh this will effect 

248.07 248.49 A: mhm 

257.17 259.31 B: future generations uh -cause 

259.42 269.38 B: i know i inherently uh have some sort of belief that uh what your folks do is uh has a large effect on uh how you will act in the future 

269.97 279.77 A: i i believe that too uh uh sometimes we think to ourselves that oh i'm never going to be anything like my parents no way no how but somehow over time 

279.92 290.81 A: those those traits just kind of creep back into your life and then one day you find yourself saying oh my god i'm my dad you know it does we can't 

291.12 295.81 A: we can't change that but there are thing we can change and 

295.97 298.84 A: i personally what is your thoughts about 

299.19 306.69 A: there are there is a movement of people that feel as though we should not make it so easy either one of two choices 

307.11 309.26 A: it is so easy for people to get married 

309.99 312.48 A: and on the other side we make it 

312.88 314.91 A: pretty easy for people to get divorced 

315.38 318.15 A: do you think we should change our laws to make it 

318.59 323.80 A: harder for either or take longer for people to either get married or get divorced 

324.19 326.41 A: to make them have to go through the process 

327.53 335.43 A: to make them feel like okay do you really want to go through all this to get married or do you really want to go through all this to get divorced 

336.71 337.04 B: well 

336.77 338.61 A: how do you feel about either one of those 

338.83 339.91 A: do you think that would help 

340.45 348.05 B: well if i could uh if i could be god for a moment and change things like that i i might but i'm not sure uh i'm not sure that 

355.28 359.82 B: i would probably make uh people wait at uh least a couple of years before they uh married 

359.94 369.40 B: they'd have to at least date for a couple of years and i don't know the further preponderance of uh problems which is them having kids and then becoming divorced uh 

369.52 373.16 B: i would say that uh possibly couples uh 

380.49 381.44 B: marriage et cetera 

381.70 382.12 A: mhm 

388.83 390.96 B: person's right to have children but 

391.62 398.03 B: i don't know i don't think it is a person's right to uh have children without uh due consideration to what kind of life that 

398.15 400.44 B: they would be providing them what do you think 

400.48 403.62 A: i i'm in i'm in total agreement 

403.74 405.57 A: i i okay 

405.93 410.22 A: it is a it is a right your body has a right a natural right 

410.35 411.31 A: to procreate 

411.99 414.66 A: but i think in today's society i think it's it 

415.16 417.73 A: is a responsibility and a accountability 

418.58 420.84 A: that we have to or we should be 

421.15 422.37 A: thinking of 

422.68 424.13 A: do i really want kids 

424.56 426.90 A: am i prepared for what that means 

427.40 429.88 A: am i prepared to give that investment 

430.14 435.83 A: of years of my life to give them what they need emotionally spiritually 

436.31 436.99 A: everything 

437.61 437.96 B: yeah 

437.63 442.52 A: it is a huge investment and i don't think a lot of times young people having babies 

442.68 443.97 A: think about any of that 

444.21 445.22 B: i agree i think 

444.51 447.12 A: i i i think it is the farthest thing from their mind 

464.75 465.18 B: and 

465.90 468.84 B: to think that they had only known that person for that long is just 

479.58 480.43 B: for what he married her 

480.63 484.34 B: he told he told me he wasn't going to screw up and make the same mistake twice 

480.65 481.09 A: hm 

484.28 484.77 A: mhm 

484.45 493.55 B: this you know this would be the final time and he was going to be sure i don't know i think that is a wise decision so it makes me want to hold out myself because i certainly won't wouldn't want to do that to my kids 

493.97 495.70 A: well you know and and i think 

495.88 499.34 A: i think there is a lot of uh there is a lot of uh 

500.56 503.40 A: thought put into that i myself was divorced 

503.97 506.87 A: i was married the first time for about seven years 

507.93 509.88 A: and we divorced and we had two children 

510.71 512.07 A: i stayed single 

512.20 513.20 A: for the next 

514.08 515.30 A: fifteen years 

515.59 516.08 B: wow 

516.37 517.62 A: before i remarried 

518.10 519.51 B: did you date in the meantime 

519.70 521.14 A: y- yeah but i 

521.38 525.53 A: i it was with the thought of i had kids they were my priority 

525.90 533.03 A: i was going to school i didn't have time for really to commit to a relationship and the other thing i was worried about was 

533.37 533.94 A: my kids 

534.47 538.52 A: i didn't know how bringing another person into our lives 

538.62 540.76 A: was going to effect them 

541.31 543.25 B: how uh how did it work out
