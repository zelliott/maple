0.00 3.42 B: my name is molly also known as omilara 

3.63 5.08 A: hi i'm gary 

4.95 6.38 B: (( hi how're ya doing )) 

6.09 7.33 A: pretty good and how are you 

7.00 8.15 B: i'm fine thanks 

7.82 9.01 A: good 

8.96 17.23 B: okay well it [mn] i found out to be a little bit humorous i think i would have to have a very large fight with my friend if i was never to speak to her again 

16.61 20.34 A: (( [laughter] yes definitely )) 

17.79 19.42 B: (( [laughter] )) 

19.96 24.50 B: um but i'd say if for a million dollars i don't think i would do it 

24.52 33.41 B: first off a million dollars right now isn't that much anyone over their lifetime can amass it or earn or if you're really lucky get it in the lottery or by stockmarket 

32.57 35.34 A: right but good friends are hard to find right 

35.20 36.64 B: (( that is true )) 

36.58 41.32 A: yeah but for with a million dollars perhaps you could find another friend who knows 

37.19 38.16 B: and fr- 

40.30 45.95 B: (( [laughter] see i got it's interesting you mentioned that but )) 

41.45 42.68 A: [laughter] 

45.12 46.95 A: [laughter] 

46.93 54.81 B: i'd say with friendship no i think the experiences that you get i think kind of take over that whole desire to get like a million dollars 

54.51 64.56 A: yeah exactly i mean what would you what would you do with it you know i mean if you got a good friend that means a lot but sometimes money doesn't necessarily buy you 

61.25 62.13 B: (( right )) 

64.71 66.57 A: friends or happiness 

66.05 67.42 B: exactly 

66.98 68.01 A: yeah 

67.44 69.27 B: (( i'm glad we agree on that [laughter] )) 

68.58 72.72 A: [laughter] well we could disagree to agree or something like that you 

72.48 73.37 B: right 

73.09 74.14 A: (( know now )) 

74.15 75.21 B: (( but if )) 

75.35 83.16 B: with a million dollars i wouldn't even know what i'd get most likely i would think of sharing it with my friend actually no i no i wouldn't [laughter] 

80.71 82.10 A: that makes sense 

82.30 88.44 A: i mean what good is money except unless you share w- with your friends yeah 

86.58 91.12 B: true but i'm thinking wait that i i wouldn't i wouldn't do that immediately [laughter] 

91.28 92.11 B: to do 

91.30 95.15 A: no you'd spend most of it first right [laughter] 

93.28 94.71 B: [laughter] 

94.99 98.08 B: [sigh] i imagine my mum would probably do it for me [laughter] 

97.45 101.71 A: oh well of course yeah [laughter] 

99.99 101.77 B: (( [laughter] not bad though )) 

101.93 107.03 B: i don't know like if you had a million dollars i don't know if i'm supposed to ask questions here what would you do with it 

106.62 117.82 A: oh i think we can talk about anything we want to oh well you know you could do all those things that you wouldn't normally think that you would do otherwise right maybe travel or something like that 

114.40 115.73 B: (( right )) 

117.22 120.61 B: right i'd want to travel to thailand 

117.96 118.82 A: (( you know )) 

119.98 122.50 A: thailand yeah 

120.69 121.88 B: (( yeah )) 

121.89 124.41 B: i've heard so many good things about that place 

124.43 126.78 A: really what have you heard 

125.16 139.83 B: yeah the- they have great food and it supposed to be the healthiest it's one of the um sub south asian countries that aren't really don't really have as many like problems of the economy political war that kind of thing the people there are so nice 

128.16 129.21 A: (( yes mhm )) 

139.47 141.22 A: that's what i've heard 

140.81 142.29 B: oh really you s- [laughter] 

141.59 146.22 A: and money goes a long way [laughter] 

143.09 145.38 B: [laughter] 

146.11 147.19 B: oh 

147.47 150.60 B: you're really into the whole [laughter] money argument aren't you [laughter] 

148.78 150.38 A: [laughter] 

151.43 162.38 A: [laughter] [laughter] no but i've heard there's a a lot of cultural things there and most people really don't know about it and it's something you normally wouldn't do and it actually costs quite a it actually 

162.67 170.90 A: actually it's really not that bad to go over there but you might not go unless you'd suddenly acquired instant wealth or something like that [sigh] 

170.43 171.18 B: mm 

171.16 178.01 A: yeah and i was i was thinking well maybe i'd go to new zealand but i could always go via thailand i suppose you know 

177.87 178.97 B: really 

178.68 179.74 A: yeah 

179.33 190.60 B: that's a pretty good idea actually i have a professor right now who's from new zealand yeah i do in marketing research but he's he's really nice that's the closest to australia that i can think of 

183.71 184.74 A: yeah 

190.51 195.80 B: but i think new zealand i don't know when i think new zealand you know xena warrior princess 

195.45 196.46 A: yes 

196.56 201.42 B: you know how it was filmed in new zealand ah so that's why you want to go [laughter] 

198.30 199.27 A: yes 

200.92 209.78 A: no [laughter] mostly because it has uh the geology is so much different you can go from like mountains to 

201.82 202.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

209.68 220.11 A: like really volcanic land to uh and it's not very populated at least the south island isn't and it's still relatively 

210.36 212.12 B: (( like right )) 

212.60 213.79 B: (( really )) 

216.84 217.83 B: that's true 

220.43 231.68 A: well there aren't as many people there and it's more you could do like really long hikes and things like that so it'd be more uh a peaceful type of thing and it would be like uh 

231.44 240.35 A: britain in that you'd have like little you know those little quaint villages things but then it's different in that you have lots of countryside 

236.71 237.67 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

239.92 244.29 B: that's true i can al- i can almost imagine living there it'd be so nice 

243.09 246.60 A: yeah so does your prof talk much about it 

246.29 255.23 B: um rarely he puts in a few um jokes about like new zealand and a few facts here and there and how he was he's into the ballet that's there 

254.83 261.96 A: oh really i didn't even know there but i suppose there would be yeah it makes sense [laughter] 

255.60 256.81 B: yeah 

258.73 259.84 B: [laughter] 

260.58 264.77 B: no like i i think he's been in the united states for a long time 

264.45 266.23 A: oh okay 

265.68 269.21 B: but he he still has the accent so i think he goes back very often 

269.16 272.00 A: oh all right well that makes sense 

270.53 271.13 B: (( yeah )) 

271.93 272.87 B: yeah 

272.27 276.55 A: so and how did you just hear about thailand i mean some of your friends 

274.83 275.66 B: um 

276.19 277.25 B: yes 

276.82 280.51 A: well see there you go you wouldn't have known right [laughter] 

278.97 281.41 B: [laughter] that's true [laughter] 

282.14 285.03 A: [laughter] and they've been right 

282.26 283.42 B: yeah 

284.80 285.68 B: pardon 

285.49 287.34 A: they've been to thailand 

286.76 291.95 B: oh yeah uh one is actually originally um a thailand guy 

287.58 288.49 A: yeah 

291.76 293.30 A: oh okay 

292.98 299.97 B: but he actually was very interested in going initially before because he had been adopted by uh i think american parents 

299.54 300.97 A: oh okay 

299.99 305.09 B: so he wanted to go back and when he did he he could not stop ranting about it 

303.68 305.09 A: [laughter] 

305.45 311.15 B: so it's pretty good [mn] just watching on like t._v. shows too i'm like ooh thailand i've 

306.60 307.82 A: yeah 

310.40 312.00 A: yeah 

311.44 312.69 B: always wanted to go 

312.29 318.08 A: so you should go anyway even if you you know don't inherit lots of money you should just when are you going 

316.14 317.57 B: [laughter] 

317.87 320.74 B: when [laughter] [laughter] 

318.60 322.88 A: yeah when you know i mean if you dream about it you should live your dreams right 

322.31 326.88 B: well that's true but in terms of a timeline for that i have absolutely no idea 

326.64 328.02 A: yeah 

327.43 330.22 B: well i don't know maybe when i'm 

330.36 332.08 B: before i have kids 

332.33 334.60 A: well that's probably a good idea yeah 

334.05 347.92 B: [laughter] yeah probably like my mum always tells me that like when she was young she used to go like grab all her friends and go travel different places and i think it's more p- possible now to do that since everything's closer and more global 

348.15 349.23 A: yeah 

348.25 351.94 B: so maybe i can convince a few people to go to thailand 

351.90 366.20 A: i think you should you know this uh call could be like one of those catalysts that just change everything right you start off on one conversation and then suddenly you discover that you really want to go to thailand so you shouldn't really think about it too much and you should just do it right 

356.91 357.98 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

365.62 368.54 B: right even if it doesn't cost a million dollars 

366.27 367.08 A: yeah 

367.94 373.49 A: ev- even if it doesn't yeah [laughter] 

370.35 371.24 B: [laughter] 

373.19 375.63 B: (( mm yes )) 

374.39 384.68 A: oh so okay so you've got the the land the people uh i mean what would be the best is bangkok bangkok's in thailand right 

384.37 385.18 B: it is 

384.88 394.21 A: yeah so would you go there or would you go like out in the country or would you go like to the coast or 'cause there's some really cool islands aren't there that you could go kayaking through 

390.45 391.05 B: (( [sigh] )) 

393.86 398.28 B: oh wow that's true actually i tried kayaking once and i loved it 

397.40 399.21 A: yeah 

398.30 400.56 B: (( yeah have you ever kayaked on the hudson )) 

400.85 403.38 A: oh no no i haven't have you 

402.33 404.98 B: oh yeah that's where i kayaked 

404.58 405.87 A: oh 

405.26 410.78 B: it's very unusual since everyone like is when they think the hudson they're like oh my gosh what a dirty river 

410.46 414.54 A: well actually i think i saw something about they kind of cleaned it up a lot 

414.33 415.35 B: right 

415.04 417.93 A: like uh and they built this uh 

418.12 420.65 A: boat like pete seger 

420.63 421.58 B: oh 

421.10 427.76 A: he built a boat it was like one of the old ones that used to go up and down the coast and that's how they got it started about cleaning everything up 

427.17 428.98 B: wow that's a pretty good idea 

428.66 432.98 A: so when you did it i mean you found some really neat places huh 

432.58 433.82 B: (( yes i did )) 

433.45 435.02 A: wow 

434.66 435.64 B: [laughter] 

435.78 439.92 A: [mn] normally you think of kayaking as like rapids and stuff but 

439.52 441.06 B: right 

440.22 448.19 A: then again i suppose it's like uh it's something that you could really explore and it's pretty convenient to do that 

447.61 449.75 B: yes it is 

448.81 452.25 A: huh so did you have lots of friends that went with you 

451.98 456.53 B: um about two my friend who introduced it to me jerry 

456.74 459.26 B: and his other friend that was about it though 

459.03 462.98 A: uh-huh oh i think that's a good group you know you don't want to get too many 

462.43 466.14 B: yeah no i can't imagine a whole group of us going kayaking a bit too rowdy 

466.23 470.04 A: oh oh perish the thought [laughter] 

468.40 472.61 B: [laughter] 

470.79 475.67 A: [laughter] so you're going again you going kayaking again 

472.72 473.28 B: (( [sigh] )) 

475.02 478.42 B: oh as soon as i get the chance yeah when i go back to new york 

478.77 480.78 A: oh you aren't in new york now 

480.58 482.57 B: no i'm in philadelphia now 

482.00 488.81 A: oh well there you go okay not i don't guess there's too many places to kayak around philadelphia right 

488.44 495.16 B: oh that's a good point although i'm always too busy to like go figure out where to go like up and down the skucool or some other river 

495.09 496.13 A: yeah 

496.19 502.42 A: so is that river how's that river for navigability or like pollution or things like that 

501.85 503.91 B: uh for the skucool you mean 

503.63 504.88 A: yeah 

504.37 507.83 B: i'm actually not that sure i figure it's 

507.84 510.01 B: it's slightly cleaner than the hudson 

509.99 511.28 A: okay 

510.65 514.44 B: but comparability not that much i i know 

512.71 513.93 A: yeah 

514.47 520.42 B: there's this very beautiful spot by the skucool that you can go to where i see people kayaking every now and then 

519.51 521.07 A: oh okay 

520.89 528.75 B: yeah and it's it's really i don't know i like it but i don't think i don't know i i'm do- i'm not a fan of philadelphia that much 

528.63 529.66 A: okay 

529.07 538.48 B: so to go over to the skucool and rent a kayak and go up and down it when i'm not too familiar with the area i wouldn't really like be encouraged to go there and do that 

534.41 535.37 A: sure 

538.46 544.36 A: oh well maybe you know when you're out and you see those kayakers you should strike up a conversation 

543.86 546.77 B: [laughter] yeah yelling out all across the bank 

545.77 558.90 A: [mn] and you could go you know if you had a million dollars would you be kayaking right now you know [laughter] and then see what [laughter] and then [laughter] and then this could change your whole idea about what it's really like you know 

549.61 552.22 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

552.82 555.12 B: [laughter] 

558.53 559.70 B: yeah 

559.07 563.55 A: yeah [laughter] [laughter] 

560.15 561.94 B: why not [laughter] 

564.07 569.50 A: and how big is this skucool or how do you pronounce that exactly i mean skucool 

567.53 568.65 B: the skucool 

569.34 571.67 B: yeah it took me a while to get it too [laughter] 

571.22 572.46 A: (( oh okay )) 

572.54 573.44 B: (( but )) 

572.67 576.78 A: 'cause i i've seen it i think and i've read about it but 

577.03 581.85 A: not had a conversation where people actually wanted to pronounce the words correctly you know 

581.12 582.49 B: [laughter] 

582.04 586.00 A: [laughter] so a single kayak 

586.04 587.74 A: a single person kayak 

587.30 588.11 B: right 

587.99 589.02 A: yeah 

588.49 595.71 B: it's i think about as it's about as tall as a normal guy maybe no actually a very tall guy maybe six feet 

595.61 599.50 A: okay was this the kind where you're sat in or you're sat on 

599.27 599.95 B: i sat
