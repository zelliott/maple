347.46 348.44 A: (( yes ))

381.98 383.65 B: right yeah 

382.91 383.93 A: (( ah )) 

384.00 388.13 A: to go back and spend time with people or to do something differently 

387.67 388.80 B: mhm 

388.48 390.75 A: i guess that would change the outcome of your 

390.15 392.04 B: [noise] [noise] that's the important thing 

391.03 394.44 A: of your existence or whatever [laughter] 

393.10 394.61 B: (( yeah yeah [laughter] ))
