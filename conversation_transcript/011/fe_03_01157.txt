138.57 140.78 A: so that's kind of tough but i guess 

140.84 149.21 A: if i could go back and and change things i would um i might change my major um in college 

147.33 150.55 B: well what what's your major 

150.53 158.64 A: um well i majored in finance and i minored in economics and although it didn't hurt me i think i would have 

154.83 155.87 B: (( oh )) 

158.29 158.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

158.73 159.84 A: um

163.87 164.89 B: (( oh )) 

166.59 168.26 B: oh okay 

168.46 171.35 A: so i guess it's not really a bad thing but i guess

173.70 180.12 A: [laughter] well that's true i i'm in instead of going back and and having to redo 

176.59 177.38 B: (( o- o- )) 

177.79 179.61 B: yeah

192.56 196.18 B: [laughter] 

193.47 194.51 A: [laughter] 

195.27 202.69 A: you know like things you learn when you're older like if you were would have only been wiser to 

198.32 200.28 B: yeah 

202.81 212.71 A: ah start a savings account or start saving for a car or start saving for a house and then you could have that so much quicker 

203.49 204.95 B: (( did it )) 

205.48 208.47 B: yeah 

212.65 219.72 B: yeah that's right but you can do it um now too i mean you can be if price is right now for the future too 

216.26 217.21 A: right

243.16 244.24 B: uh-huh 

243.86 246.00 A: wow what brought you here 

246.04 255.96 B: ah i don't know [laughter] life life [laughter] no i i did my master here so 

248.87 250.35 A: just decided huh 

251.03 252.06 A: life 

256.37 259.38 B: i came here to get my master degree 

258.92 263.51 A: oh so do you plan on going back or do you like it here enough to you want to stay or 

263.53 269.80 B: i will stay for for the while and then ah after that i i will decide 

269.08 270.06 A: mhm 

270.10 276.97 B: (( ah with this like what is the purpose of ah this ah phone conversation i'm intrigued )) 

275.76 277.75 A: i have no idea 

277.92 280.77 B: [laughter] 

278.18 284.16 A: i am probably as much confused about the purpose of these calls as you are 

284.06 285.51 B: oh okay 

285.03 289.14 A: yeah seriously i i i have no idea i i thought of that 

286.03 286.77 B: but 

288.19 299.16 B: none my i just wondered like ah i haven't ah done it before so i thought somebody is going to call me up with some question 

298.66 299.56 A: (( mhm )) 

299.44 303.86 B: and then they are they are doing some scientific ah researches 

303.66 304.57 A: right 

304.75 310.61 B: (( ah but ah i guess like bot- bot- peop- ah people are sh- )) 

310.47 322.77 B: participants ah nobody is but i guess they are ah recording this conversation and they will decide ah they will get something else out of it i guess 

311.81 312.83 A: right 

322.48 325.28 A: i guess yeah i i don't know 

324.14 333.26 B: and the first thing they will realise that people leave the subject and then talk about some other things right [laughter] 

331.03 342.32 A: well you know it's kind of funny because the first one i did was about bio-warfare and the guy i was talking to knew a lot about it 

339.84 341.04 B: yeah 

341.48 342.88 B: (( oh )) 

342.46 349.85 A: and he talked constantly i mean he just he was telling me about articles he had read and um 

345.56 347.48 B: [laughter] 

349.92 352.72 A: he he knew a lot about it and so he was 

352.09 354.09 B: (( yeah )) 

352.80 356.05 A: talking about it the entire time 

355.04 355.60 B: (( [mn] )) 

356.40 357.53 B: (( oh )) 

356.82 363.37 A: so that part was was kind of interesting but yeah i guess it's more nature to talk about different things after 

363.41 371.64 A: you stop talking about time travel 'cause it did- it didn't have to be personal the time travel 'cause then i could think you know you could go 

365.43 367.76 B: (( yeah )) 

370.73 379.71 B: yeah i can um i can talk about it um like since i got my master in ah engineering i know about the dim- 

379.93 384.76 B: ah dimension and the travelling on time 

383.69 384.72 A: mhm 

384.81 390.64 B: (( you know lately ah the the guy ah i forgot his name )) 

390.91 399.69 B: ah he he is trying to prove that ah einstein theory the light theory e. equal m. c. square is not 

395.27 396.18 A: mhm 

399.54 402.16 B: (( totally right )) 

401.10 402.28 A: oh really 

402.02 410.36 B: (( yeah so yesterday i was reading and that article it was kind of interesting )) 

410.01 411.31 A: i guess so 

410.20 418.27 B: be- be- because if he is right then the ah einstein ah proved that if we ah move faster than 

418.39 422.09 B: ah light then we can travel ah we 

422.60 428.89 B: can travel in in time dimension through dimension so 

429.11 436.18 B: but if he proved that it it it he is wrong on that and i guess they will come up with new ideas 

435.77 436.78 A: right 

437.17 438.88 B: (( yeah )) 

437.23 438.18 A: wow 

438.29 440.48 A: it just amazes me that people 

441.04 443.24 A: are smart enough to 

443.34 444.86 A: um even 

445.06 448.82 A: challenge [laughter] things ah from history you know 

446.57 448.45 B: [laughter] 

448.73 453.02 B: yeah but ah everytime you have to challenge the 

453.12 455.30 B: (( one otherwise we cannot )) 

456.48 457.66 A: that's true 

456.88 465.07 B: (( because because einstein challenge ah newton theories and he proved that ah newton theories is )) 

465.02 476.40 B: (( ah you can apply newton theories in ah in certain ah cert- certain situation not ah for um for everything so )) 

477.06 487.58 B: so he challenge newton now this guy challenge new- ah einstein in the future somebody will challenge this guy and they took they took i guess [mn] 

484.21 485.28 A: right 

485.63 486.71 A: (( i guess that's )) 

486.98 489.82 A: the the benefit of technology 

489.87 492.54 A: to keep challenging the previous 

492.65 493.83 A: genius [laughter] 

494.15 495.88 B: yeah [laughter] 

496.30 500.45 A: i think you're probably pretty smart too an engineer you've got a masters in engineering 

500.37 506.30 B: yeah i ah yeah i have master in mechanical engineering 

500.90 501.82 A: degree 

505.47 507.10 A: wow so what do you do 

507.12 517.76 B: (( ah i'm working for the ah software company we yeah we develop software for engineering c- ah industry )) 

511.01 511.87 A: uh-huh 

516.95 517.78 A: hm 

518.08 527.51 B: so to do the calculations and to manage the projects for the software company well what do you do 

524.08 525.03 A: wow 

527.38 532.04 A: i work for a brokerage firm so i work with the stock market 

532.08 533.55 B: oh really 

532.73 544.47 A: which which has been very bad [laughter] actually actually today it was good we had a like a like a three percent increase so today was actually good but with after the president's address um 

534.73 538.07 B: [laughter] is it 

539.87 540.96 B: wow 

544.38 554.36 A: we're very curious to see what's going to happen in tomorrow's market and and going forward you know it's hard to hard to tell but it's an interesting field i mean it's 

546.41 548.91 B: yeah yeah yeah 

550.34 551.43 B: [laughter] 

553.63 561.00 B: yeah it is like um i don't know but too much think about it and i don't understand that much 

561.07 569.49 B: that's why i bought something ah last year and then um lost all the money that i put in [laughter] 

565.43 569.12 A: [laughter] what did you buy 

569.62 578.55 B: [laughter] there was a a software company in ah virginia and i i bought ah their stock 

572.66 573.49 A: uh-huh 

574.18 575.07 A: uh-huh 

578.07 579.70 A: well you know 

578.57 585.10 B: and they did- they didn't do good last year and then most of the software companies they didn't do 

582.09 582.90 A: [laughter] 

584.91 588.70 A: yeah it was it was a tough time for a lot of stocks but 

589.19 599.95 A: y- y- you know you certainly weren't alone and and really a a a lot of people um you know they do they pick a a a stock that's either something that 

590.27 591.29 B: ah 

593.25 594.25 B: (( good ))
