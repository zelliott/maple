109.96 118.37 A: y- who he's two years old and sick and i'm going through a divorce and well you know i've doing this by myself forever it seems 

114.06 115.22 B: right 

118.03 119.04 B: uh-huh 

118.51 119.55 A: (( and ah )) 

120.04 122.64 A: yeah i would i would probably just change ah a 

123.00 126.06 A: few of my ah judgment calls [laughter] 

125.24 126.38 B: yeah 

126.34 132.35 A: [laughter] not that i would want to ah not have my child because i love him but the husband the husband thing 

132.52 134.03 A: [laughter] 

132.63 134.98 B: [laughter] [laughter] choose a different husband 

134.34 143.34 A: yeah i would have definitely i would have stuck with one of those hu- one of those guys that i's going out with when i was in my twenties but i was enjoying my freedom at the time 

135.39 136.67 B: [laughter] 

139.84 141.26 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

142.80 143.84 B: uh-huh 

143.50 149.25 A: because uh yeah i had a tough childhood so when i got o- out when i moved out at nineteen 

149.37 154.51 A: boy it was just the greatest thing i was just enjoying my life you know but i was th- a- 

154.65 157.86 A: ah appreciating it as much as i wish i had mm 

157.05 158.89 B: right right 

159.00 161.05 B: yeah i think that i could go back 

161.11 167.24 B: not that far i'm twenty seven um and i'm married and i have a six month old son 

163.56 164.70 A: (( right now )) 

166.76 167.80 A: wow 

167.35 170.97 B: and um i think that i would spend 

171.36 175.42 B: more time my husband and i met when we lived in new york city 

175.37 187.81 B: and ah we're now in alabama and i think that i had graduated from college and moved up to new york on my own not knowing a soul up there and just started my career and started a life for myself 

187.45 188.67 A: mhm 

187.88 199.94 B: and i think that i would go back and push off my husband and i deciding to leave new york so quickly it's kind of like we had a bad day and said that's it let's move and we actually moved to florida 

195.44 196.35 A: mhm 

199.67 200.49 A: wow 

199.86 211.10 B: and i think that i would say that i prefer i if i could change anything i would have stayed up there longer and spent more time with my career and 

211.49 213.45 B: just doing that whole thing 

212.94 214.13 A: mhm 

213.35 227.34 B: you know up there and i mean i look back on it and that was like such a great time in my life and i think that he and i should have spent more time doing that because when we moved to florida we got married you know two and a half years later we had a child and so you know 

218.27 219.19 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

227.47 229.50 B: being able to spend more time 

229.02 234.52 A: mhm see that sounds similar to me i was i w- but i was twenty nine when i got married and then uh 

232.90 233.74 B: uh-huh 

235.07 238.14 A: like less than two years i had i had my son 

238.34 242.74 A: but ah yeah that's it's always you kn- that's what i think you know i would i 

242.96 244.32 A: i wish i had a 

244.35 246.13 A: thought about my career more 

245.99 247.24 B: mhm 

246.59 253.69 A: and and and done s- well you know i thought i was going to be married and taking care of a family that's really what i was planning on doing but now 

251.08 252.04 B: right 

254.31 259.24 A: i wish i had done if i could turn back the time i'd be in court reporting school right now 

258.81 259.74 B: oh 

259.16 271.17 A: [laughter] that's what i would be doing [laughter] i sit on this computer twenty four hours a day now i just enjoy this computer so much and i think boy you know if i just had stuck to you know maybe a 

260.45 261.61 B: [laughter] 

262.60 263.77 B: oh wow 

272.22 275.64 A: i couldn't really afford college but some kind of schooling 

275.05 276.02 B: right 

275.71 276.77 A: and uh 

276.86 284.86 A: g- i could be so far so much farther ahead even even in the same situation with my son i could just life would be a whole lot easier 

279.49 280.53 B: right 

284.52 288.11 B: yeah and you don't have the opportunity now to do the training 

287.64 301.28 A: no i really can't i mean i don't even drive and and if i could turn back the clock i'd like to be a different person so as i didn't have that fear of driving [laughter] [laughter] because after i gave birth to my son 

289.09 289.91 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

296.14 297.64 B: oh [laughter] 

301.28 305.96 A: the fear intensified because i couldn't even think of ah 

303.13 304.10 B: huh 

306.44 312.76 A: getting in the car and putting my son in the car at the same time and driving at all that was totally out of it so yeah there's 

310.02 311.28 B: (( right uh-huh )) 

313.73 315.66 A: (( there's there's a lot of things i could ah )) 

316.79 320.22 A: would like to change if i could turn back the clock 

319.90 321.35 B: yeah 

321.36 331.59 A: think about it that's a very good subject seriously i could go on and on [laughter] they must have i don't know they must have done a survey and saw what i was doing here [laughter] 

324.87 327.88 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

329.90 333.07 B: [laughter] 

331.69 333.99 A: [laughter] oh boy 

332.89 347.89 B: [laughter] yeah yeah i guess because i would like to change that part as far as you know spending more time in that part of my life like you know geographically and what was going on because it was such a wonderful time 

334.06 335.24 A: mhm 

347.50 348.65 A: right 

347.86 356.15 B: you know but if but if i could change it then i wouldn't be here and i probably wouldn't have my six month old son and you know have this wonderful life you know and [laughter] so 

351.74 354.23 A: and that that's exactly how i feel 

354.28 362.34 A: right that's exactly how i feel too is i i love my son and i wouldn't you know i wouldn't change anything for the world because i i have him but 

358.07 359.09 B: yeah 

359.80 360.82 B: right 

361.71 363.87 B: mhm mhm 

362.60 374.17 A: ah just l- like career options and just maybe enjoying a little more and appreciating a little more when i was younger so that ah maybe i wouldn't be missing it so much right now [laughter] you know 

373.43 375.79 B: yeah yeah 

374.30 381.18 A: [laughter] i have it probably would you know if i was able to get out and do it i wouldn't probably be missing 

382.33 383.74 A: so much 

383.51 384.51 B: right 

384.09 386.18 A: i don't know it's hard to explain 

386.28 390.81 A: hard to explain i- it's not like i i think all the time oh i wish i was 

390.85 392.68 A: back in time you know or 

391.95 393.02 B: right 

393.27 396.23 A: there are some instances where you just think boy if i'd a 

396.28 399.42 A: made one different judgment call 

398.86 400.94 B: yeah yeah 

399.83 401.72 A: things would be different 

401.11 404.01 B: yeah i guess that you 

404.54 410.98 B: know i don't know i guess no matter what you do no matter how fully you live your life you'll probably you- there's probably always something 

410.52 411.70 A: mhm 

411.02 420.42 B: that you know well what if i had done this instead or you know made this decision instead of that decision and no matter what you do 

413.71 414.53 A: (( yeah )) 

417.63 418.80 A: mhm 

420.59 422.21 B: that's always oh 

420.74 424.83 A: yeah that's like i up with my first love i just wish i'd of married him 

425.43 426.51 B: [laughter] 

425.46 436.08 A: [laughter] still i mean we were still friends you know for a long time i've lost contact with him but ah there was another person in my twenties i had met but i was enjoying freedom 

428.36 429.08 B: (( oh )) 

430.06 430.94 B: uh-huh 

435.79 436.74 B: right 

436.33 437.48 A: and uh 

437.95 440.53 A: didn't realize what i had at the time 

440.01 440.91 B: yeah 

441.13 442.22 B: wow 

441.66 446.42 A: you know if you i think about it all the time thinking boy you know if i'd of just ah 

446.80 448.59 A: stopped for a second 

448.94 456.85 A: and thought about it you know i probably would have i would have i most definitely would have married him because he was a perfect family man very smart 

449.95 450.97 B: uh-huh 

456.68 457.63 B: uh-huh 

457.08 458.08 A: (( you know )) 

458.55 460.05 A: and instead 

460.17 467.53 A: [laughter] i chose freedom and how ironic is it that now i have no freedom [laughter] 

465.91 469.23 B: [laughter] [laughter] oh [laughter] 

467.68 473.68 A: you know i realy don't twenty four hours a day taking care of my son e- even when he's 

469.57 470.65 B: yeah 

471.85 475.09 B: mhm is he does he go to school or 

474.67 481.35 A: in w- well when he's in school then i am uh taking care of things that i can't take care of when he's home 

480.08 481.80 B: when he's around yes 

481.40 488.41 A: so it's i mean i was working for a while but then i i tore my ah rotor cuff on my shoulder so that 

488.67 491.11 A: stopped me from doing the kind of work i was doing 

490.50 491.41 B: uh-huh 

491.20 495.08 A: and so now i'm just i mean i i enjoy taking care of my son full time 

495.27 498.21 A: but it would have been a whole lot nicer if 

499.47 500.88 A: financially 

501.13 504.38 A: you know i had made difference choices when i was younger 

503.09 504.94 B: right right 

506.86 507.72 B: huh 

507.39 512.52 A: i don't know just i- it's funny how you just appreciate things differently 

508.18 509.30 B: yeah 

512.10 518.67 B: yeah i'm trying so hard to try you know just to to appreciate the stage that we're in our lives now um 

517.88 523.26 A: you most definitely should seeing as i'm i'm past that well i'm forty three years old 

519.24 520.20 B: yeah 

523.45 524.35 A: so 

524.71 525.47 A: (( [laughter] )) 

525.65 526.66 B: yeah 

525.71 536.15 A: because the grey hairs are popping out [laughter] like you know i'm a i'm i'm a kind of a young forty three so when the grey hairs popped out i went into shock 

527.79 528.98 B: [laughter] 

532.42 533.33 B: uh-huh 

535.53 537.67 B: [laughter] 

536.12 544.70 A: and i my son was laughing at me in fact as i was looking in the mirror going oh my god [laughter] and he was just hysterical laughing at me 

541.12 543.43 B: [laughter] 

544.59 553.21 A: and um then i i d- i went to work that day and i went home and i dashed to the beauty salon and i said you have to do something [laughter] that's 

544.62 546.09 B: [laughter] 

551.16 555.07 B: (( you have to do that [laughter] fix it [laughter] )) 

553.51 562.54 A: [mn] this cannot be happening [laughter] and it was v- you know i'd never thought of myself as having grey hair 

555.94 557.91 B: [laughter] 

562.30 563.44 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

562.78 576.87 A: you know i just i'm a young i'm young at ah heart probably [laughter] so i don't think about that kind of stuff and then the shoulder goes and the grey hairs pop and i say oh god here we go [laughter] and it really makes you think 

568.38 569.40 B: uh-huh 

573.23 575.18 B: [laughter] 

577.14 578.40 B: yeah 

577.79 582.97 A: you know boy i should have done this or that when i was younger [laughter] 

581.57 582.74 B: yeah 

582.70 587.38 B: yeah yeah a friend of mine was telling me when i had our son 

587.21 599.89 B: she's like you know the whole time she when her kids were little she kept thinking oh i can't wait till they can do this or you know c- till they can talk or they can crawl or they can walk and she said she spent their whole you know the their whole 

592.83 593.46 A: mm 

594.27 595.29 A: (( [mn] ))
