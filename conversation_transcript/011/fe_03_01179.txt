22.98 24.62 B: yeah 

23.85 25.84 A: kinda muggy and everything so 

25.73 26.49 B: (( mm )) 

26.68 29.29 B: so would you not talk to your best friend again 

29.00 34.47 A: um that that's debatable 'cause you know finan- finances are kind of tight right now so 

34.58 36.68 A: i don't think i would 

36.18 37.36 B: really 

36.77 40.73 A: yeah [laughter] yeah i don't think [laughter] i would that would be 

37.81 39.66 B: [laughter] 

39.92 44.31 B: finances must be real tight or your best friend's not that good of a friend [laughter] 

43.45 52.23 A: well see really i don't have a be- i don't really have any best friends right now anyway so you know i've been through a long hard road with recovery and everything so i really don't have any best friends 

49.86 51.14 B: oh recove- 

51.98 53.62 B: recovering from what 

53.31 56.17 A: uh recovering from uh drugs and stuff you know 

55.77 57.44 B: (( mm that is )) 

56.55 58.59 A: alcohol yeah 

57.78 59.85 B: that's gotta be a tough road 

58.97 66.20 A: yes yes well you think you have friends but when you get in trouble or or you know things happen they're not there for you so that's why i say that 

65.62 66.80 B: mhm 

66.25 67.14 A: you know 

67.20 69.98 B: well i have a fantastic best friend 

69.44 71.17 A: well that's good isn't it 

70.30 75.14 B: and uh and i don't think i could uh give her up for a million dollars [laughter] 

74.09 84.38 A: yeah and i [laughter] i don't blame you i used to have a lot of good friends 'til i was interested in the drug scene but you know what i'm saying so now it's like doing a dance and start loving myself again 

83.96 85.18 B: right 

84.75 88.77 A: so anybody that does drugs especially crack cocaine cannot love themselves 

88.34 89.77 B: yeah 

89.17 92.49 A: so and that's what i've been going through but i'm trying to deal with it 

91.92 96.24 B: well good for you then that you've realised that and you're moving on from that 

93.00 94.22 A: mhm 

94.43 101.31 A: oh yeah it took years to realise but now i finally i guess the uh the past finally hit me in the face 

100.88 101.99 B: [laughter] 

101.43 102.99 A: so i had to deal with it 

102.87 105.22 B: yeah well well that's good 

104.68 108.15 A: yeah so you got any pets 

106.37 107.29 B: (( how )) 

107.70 111.40 B: um i don't i've got a five month old baby who 

110.77 114.42 A: oh so you can't have pets i bet you're busy all the time too 

113.91 117.53 B: she does keep us pretty busy yeah [laughter] i've 

115.47 121.32 A: [laughter] yeah my little sister just had a um a little boy a month ago 

121.35 127.65 A: and he was premature a month early but now he's uh he's doing fine he's nine mo- he's nine pounds now 

123.32 124.43 B: oh 

127.25 128.71 B: (( oh good )) 

127.99 130.20 A: but he weighed four pounds when he was born 

129.76 136.43 B: oh gosh my baby was almost nine pounds when [laughter] she was born [laughter] but is he out of the hospital and 

131.84 133.09 A: oh really 

133.24 134.29 A: gosh 

135.93 141.48 A: oh yeah he's doing fine i saw him on sunday we spent the whole day together he's just a bundle of joy 

137.34 138.57 B: good 

141.21 141.79 B: (( ooh )) 

141.92 145.31 B: they they will change your life they really will 

141.99 143.41 A: (( he really is )) 

144.76 151.33 A: yeah she she she keeps him dressed so cute and and smelling so good i tell him he smells so good enough to eat [laughter] 

149.85 154.29 B: [laughter] that's what i tell my daughter all the time i'm going to eat you up 

152.30 153.57 A: yeah 

153.69 158.05 A: exactly but you know peop- um children are a joy you know 

154.99 155.99 B: [laughter] 

157.28 159.83 B: mhm you don't have any of your own 

159.32 173.05 A: no i don't have any of my own i just um i used to travel a lot so you know people should realize when when uh you travel a lot you want to be spontaneous t that kids um that's why they have planned parenthood you know what i mean 

167.91 169.13 B: mhm 

171.92 174.46 B: [laughter] oh for sure 

173.78 178.40 A: because children don't make a choice the parents make the choice to bring them into the world 

178.01 179.86 B: yeah absolutely 

179.33 184.22 A: so they should uh ma- you know plan their lives around that you know what's going on in their lives 

184.03 185.44 B: yeah 

184.23 187.91 A: and just no make any rash decision like that 

187.20 193.74 B: your life definitely changes once you have them we used to be able to just pack up and go any time we wanted and 

188.83 191.11 A: mhm yeah everything 

193.83 197.26 B: now the packing up takes a whole lot longer [laughter] 

194.88 195.82 A: [laughter] 

196.37 198.78 A: so you know what i mean when i say it 'cause 

197.54 199.75 B: oh i know exactly what you mean 

198.99 208.98 A: i like to just go and come when i get ready so you know children are not planned in my life but i'm thirty five and my my two sisters and they got enough kids for me so 

208.65 213.76 B: well that's good at least you've got nieces and nephews that you can love on and and appreciate 

212.26 213.32 A: yeah 

213.38 218.77 A: one niece and uh who was born on my birthday august twentieth and uh three nephews 

216.71 217.72 B: (( oh ok )) 

218.40 219.60 B: oh wow 

219.06 220.64 A: mhm 

219.95 222.19 B: [mn] and they're all close to you 

221.60 225.27 A: they're all close to me they lo- they love their uncle harold and i love them too 

224.72 228.81 B: oh that's sweet you can love 'em and give 'em back 

225.68 226.58 A: yeah 

228.02 231.98 A: that's right [laughter] send them home when i get [laughter] when they get on my nerves wh- 

231.31 232.90 B: exactly 

231.99 237.67 A: they rarely get on my nerves though but they just uh they they really uh really well mannered kids 

237.35 238.84 B: what ages are they 

238.42 244.69 A: eleven uh six three and one month old mhm 

243.01 246.41 B: okay you've got a a good variety 

245.72 251.60 A: yeah my oldest sister she's ah thirty four she had one kid and that she said that was enough for her 

246.54 247.43 B: and 

251.70 255.70 A: and she uh she's a hair stylist so she uh she travels all the time too 

255.74 261.31 A: but my little sister keeps she's a dental assistant and it's it's a close knit thing you know 

261.00 263.80 B: well that's nice to have all that family so close 

263.38 264.93 A: yeah 

264.09 265.99 B: have they been real supportive for you 

265.34 269.80 A: oh yeah they have i've be- they've been through the good bad and the ugly they've been there for me 

269.38 276.18 B: that's good so i guess maybe maybe the hypothetical question should uh say if you couldn't talk to a relative 

276.24 277.96 B: instead of a best friend 

278.13 279.00 A: no 

278.21 280.28 B: how wo- how would that affect your decision 

279.35 286.33 A: n- no i wo- i wouldn't i wouldn't take it i wouldn't take that for for a million dollars [laughter] no i wouldn't 

281.31 282.41 B: yeah 

284.14 285.15 B: yep 

285.17 288.94 B: so that's probably a a better hypothetical question for you 

286.99 296.22 A: yeah yeah because friends you know you can you you can accept friendship but you can't take family family is you know it's closer than anything to me so 

292.85 293.80 B: right 

296.05 299.61 B: absolutely that's great that they've been very supportive for you 

296.50 297.06 A: (( [mn] )) 

299.20 310.11 A: yes yeah but i i was thinking sunday you know as i saw my little nephew and we was out [mn] in the yard playing and one of our um family friends passed she's forty eight she had lung cancer 

310.02 311.05 B: oh 

310.59 316.06 A: and i was saying you know everybody 'cause i'm a well known person everybody likes me i make everybody laugh i'm a clown 

315.61 316.23 B: (( mm [laughter] )) 

316.23 317.22 A: so 

317.37 324.21 A: i was just outside and enjoying the sunshine sunday and uh that that's enough to to make me stay sober looking at my nieces and nephews 

323.91 325.13 B: yeah oh 

324.26 326.71 A: the way they have the unconditional love for me 

326.23 328.47 B: well that's great 

327.60 330.28 A: so that that's enough to keep me clean and sober 

330.12 333.96 B: good well you just need to think about that every time [laughter] 

332.24 341.34 A: oh yeah every time i try to get persuaded because you know i'm i used to be a knucklehead about that you know just go somewhere and some e- i want to do what everybody else is doing so 

340.97 342.19 B: mhm 

341.76 344.48 A: you know and that's not a good thing anymore for me 

343.89 346.72 B: now would you say it was because of the people that you were hanging around with 

346.18 355.71 A: oh yeah yeah like i said i thought i had friends you know but if if anybody's giving me drugs or or you know that's not a friend if they were really concerned about your health and your wellbeing 

347.47 348.62 B: (( absolutely )) 

355.36 356.45 B: right 

355.88 361.67 A: you know that's not a friend especially if they see you losing uh you know things that you worked hard for 

361.83 366.32 A: and they're not you know saying well that's wrong don't do don't give this away you know what i mean 

365.68 369.93 B: yeah absolutely th- there's no friendship there at all 

367.15 368.51 A: (( you know so )) 

368.99 370.83 A: right no so 

370.97 375.34 A: like i said when i when everything ran out and everything was gone then nobody was there 

374.95 376.12 B: mhm 

375.62 383.71 A: so i w- i had to deal with this alone so that's the way i'm gonna be now you know just talk get closer to god and keep myself straight 

382.91 386.61 B: [noise] well good you you sound like you're definitely on the right path 

385.71 399.74 A: oh yeah yeah it it took me years to get this way but i'm finally here because like i said at the meetings i went to um they said how if you do drugs or anything you're not loving yourself that's l- committing slow a slow suicide 

399.03 400.23 B: mhm 

399.75 401.68 A: so and that's true 

401.41 409.72 B: absolutely and it's just it's selfish really when you start thinking about it and thinking about who you're leaving behind and how how they have to deal with it 

402.23 403.33 A: mhm 

404.36 406.81 A: oh yeah [laughter] yeah 

407.43 408.53 A: right 

408.92 412.31 A: mhm that's r- that's you know and that's what i thought about 'cause 

412.32 417.17 A: half the people that i saw when i was in treatment uh they couldn't come back 

417.05 417.93 B: yeah 

417.22 420.76 A: you know it was death there's three things it's treatment jails or death 

420.42 421.64 B: mhm 

421.05 431.88 A: you know and it's just so [mn] you have to take i can't i take it one hour at a time not one day that's how critical my my my using was i had to take it one hour at a time 

431.30 434.06 B: well at least you realise that that's great 

432.52 434.97 A: mhm yeah 

434.33 436.34 B: well good 

436.88 440.29 B: um trying to think what else [laughter] 

438.50 442.14 A: i know i [laughter] i'm trying to think of something else to say too [laughter] 

441.29 446.35 B: [laughter] [sigh] we've done pretty good talking as strangers for a while [laughter]
