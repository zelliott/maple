7.00 9.60 B: [mn] have you is this call number one 

9.53 11.37 A: yes is it for you too 

11.13 12.59 B: yeah 

11.82 14.03 A: okay i've never done this before 

12.61 13.26 B: (( [laughter] )) 

13.73 16.80 B: so me neither kind of weird [laughter] 

15.94 24.15 A: okay i guess we're supposed to talk about if we could go back in time and change something what it would be and why do you want to go first or do you want me to go first 

24.57 25.82 B: you go ahead do 

25.56 26.40 A: okay 

26.27 27.99 B: you have an idea [laughter] 

27.20 38.56 A: my answer would be i wouldn't want to go back in time because all of the decisions and mistakes that i've made in my life have made me the person that i am today and i wouldn't want to change any of that 

38.95 41.83 B: that's exactly what my answer was going to be 

41.25 42.86 A: [laughter] 

41.92 42.77 B: um 

43.40 46.45 B: and a lot of stuff that i didn't necessarily 

47.06 49.44 B: like in my life and it's not that i 

49.93 55.76 B: necessarily would have chosen um this if i had the opportunity beforehand to say yeah this is what i want to do 

56.02 61.80 B: but like you said it made me who i am today so i wouldn't want to go back and redo it actually 

61.42 69.37 A: no i wouldn't either i wouldn't change anything really made a lot of mistakes myself but they've made me the person i am today 

70.38 74.32 A: which is not very bad [laughter] not very good but not very bad [laughter] 

70.40 71.34 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

72.36 73.11 B: no 

74.00 76.71 B: i agree with you i agree with you you know you 

77.02 80.16 B: if i could go back that many years ago and just 

80.47 87.12 B: be stupid you know and live life not really knowing anything because like you said it's your experiences that 

88.00 89.99 B: give you wisdom and [mn] 

90.93 99.42 B: make you learn learn about people and learn about yourself the way i look at it is i would have gone back and lived you know this perfect life 

99.64 102.82 B: had given the chance to i feel like i would have been a 

103.54 106.11 B: very naive person in the world 

105.67 111.63 A: yes look i wouldn't want to go back either because that could change things in the present 

111.87 118.88 A: you know if i went back and changed something and that affected my decision to have children then i wouldn't have the wonderful children that i have now 

118.76 119.83 B: right 

120.24 122.17 B: i agree it's [mn] 

120.98 122.29 A: so 

122.52 125.53 B: but ah like the movies back to the future 

125.77 128.61 B: those were so intriguing to people 

128.18 129.68 A: oh yeah they were 

129.43 134.56 B: [laughter] just the concept of like you said you know you go back and change something 

129.98 130.95 A: yeah 

135.18 137.78 B: it affects the whole future 

137.06 137.63 A: (( [cough] )) 

138.08 139.60 A: that's true 

140.87 148.23 A: so i wonder how long they want us to talk about this [laughter] now that we don't really have anything to talk about we wouldn't want to change anything 

144.53 145.70 B: [mn] huh 

148.49 156.27 B: [mn] actually they they say you're supposed to talk for like ten minutes eight to ten minutes or you don't it doesn't register 

155.88 158.52 A: oh well i guess we better keep talking 

158.42 165.45 B: [mn] when i when it first said time travel i was thinking more of in the future if you could go to the future and look at something 

164.77 166.23 A: right me too 

166.15 170.17 B: and the reason that intrigues me is because i've got d- well two 

170.32 174.15 B: young sons well they're teenagers but just nineteen and 

172.66 174.92 A: you want to see how they turn out 

174.62 177.86 B: nineteen and twenty no not them but they both have children 

177.53 178.99 A: oh 

178.19 187.69 B: and me and my husband always say you know it was hard raising kids when we did but man they have got it against them now i wouldn't want to raise a kid from infant up nowadays 

188.74 195.64 B: i look to how things are going to be in ten years or so and you know they're dealing with their kids in school and 

195.20 196.44 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

195.83 198.03 B: what this world's going to be like 

198.02 198.95 A: yeah 

198.22 202.21 B: that's what i wish if i could go anywhere in time it would be to the future and see 

201.18 203.95 A: yeah i would i would want to go to the future too 

204.15 204.91 B: (( yeah th- )) 

205.43 206.84 B: i wouldn't ah 

208.22 212.83 B: i don't know things have totally changed since i just raising kids even 

212.51 217.96 A: oh yeah they definitely have i've got a nine year old and an eleven year old and i know how they've changed 

218.10 231.66 A: i was just telling my mom the other day things are not like it used to be when we were kids because you know you could go to the school and you could voice your opinion now they just want you to be quiet and not say anything and do as you're told and everything's different 

218.26 219.51 B: oh yours are s- 

231.69 234.55 B: that's right and the violence in this world 

234.07 236.06 A: oh yes that's terrible 

236.31 244.01 B: my daughter in law had just taken her her infant of four months um out for a walk yesterday it was where are you at by the way 

243.79 245.69 A: i'm in texas 

245.05 259.13 B: oh you are okay we're up in minnesota [laughter] and we actually had a reprieve yesterday it was a really nice day out so she took her daughter for a walk and was walking down the road and there was kids throwing snowballs and she just very ni- i mean we're talking she said like 

246.86 248.39 A: oh okay

261.08 267.93 B: and she just very nicely said to 'em you know do you mind not throwing them this way because you know so you don't hit my daughter because they were 

267.94 273.53 B: damn near nailed the stroller a couple of times and they loo- they looked at her and said f. you 

270.12 271.18 A: oh my goodness 

273.97 279.09 B: we can do whatever we want and she was like whoa you know seven year olds
