138.13 138.93 B: so

141.11 142.73 A: eight oh okay 

142.78 144.10 A: how's your weather been 

144.07 146.50 B: oh it's been wonderful today 

145.45 146.30 A: yeah 

146.37 149.31 A: we've had a really nice winter for that matter 

149.73 162.47 B: yeah i'm hoping now we've had some really warm days the last two weeks and of course spring is almost here i'm hoping that it continues that way but here in the south we have strange weather it's 

161.50 163.04 A: you never know 

162.78 168.26 B: a it's not unusual for us we've had an actual ice storm in april so 

163.38 164.59 A: (( it's kind of )) 

167.71 169.56 A: oh really wow 

168.65 172.15 B: yeah i mean it can get really really bizarre 

171.84 173.29 A: oh my goodness 

173.48 187.86 A: we've had just it's just we have had very little rain whenever it's rained this winter it's come in mass and just hit for a few days really hard and then it's gone away and like today it's sunny and beautiful out it's just very crazy 

187.73 189.41 B: oh okay 

189.03 198.18 A: and i mean i've lived here what about we've been here for about twenty some odd years but i'm originally from seattle so i'm kinda used to the rain [laughter] 

197.51 199.37 B: oh okay 

199.05 200.99 A: and you've lived in the south all your life 

200.79 208.15 B: uh-huh been here um with the exception of well for about six months i was in um 

201.62 202.39 A: oh 

208.36 211.06 B: outside of cambridge massachusetts 

210.52 211.34 A: (( mm )) 

211.06 213.83 B: and um it was too cold there 

213.70 226.89 B: and then my brother went to work in michigan in pontiac michigan so i would spend summers with him but it was still it was wasn't the south i just i love the south i love the the weather usually 

226.49 227.97 A: even the humidity 

227.58 231.25 B: even the humidity it's just it's just always been home 

231.08 238.50 A: see now there again there's if i had something to change i probably wouldn't have stayed in california it would have been my choice to leave 

236.23 237.54 B: oh really 

238.31 246.31 A: yeah because people who live here if you ask you can always ask them the same question and you'll get the same answers why are you here and it's the weather 

246.10 257.44 A: they they never have any other reason to give you why they are still here why they are still here i mean life is crazy it is hectic it is fast it you know it's just 

249.86 251.69 B: [laughter] 

257.74 264.57 A: i'd probably move back home [laughter] i have because there's so many things that we would do over again [laughter] in in a sense 

259.60 261.21 B: (( oh )) 

263.49 266.45 B: i know i know um 

266.49 270.38 B: i think that primarily it would be for me getting married 

270.15 283.66 B: now m- m- m- i think that my husband and i had a very good relationship before we got married but once we got married he turned into his father one of those you know you're my wife and you'll do what i say kinda thing 

278.99 280.65 A: oh 

281.88 283.35 A: (( uh-huh )) 

283.48 287.63 B: because his his parents had the kind of relationship where 

287.56 301.93 B: his mother just doted on his family on you know his his brothers and sisters and his dad one of those now again see this is probably not easy for you to relate to but here in the south women tend to be um 

291.77 293.11 A: mhm 

302.21 310.13 B: where men are almost put on pedestals i know his mother worked just like his dad did 

307.67 308.65 A: (( wow )) 

309.31 313.20 A: i don't think i would like that [laughter] 

310.93 315.24 B: (( [laughter] but now listen )) 

313.84 316.78 A: i'm too much in charge [laughter] 

315.88 321.47 B: well after she had worked eight hours just like he had and then took care of their kids 

321.25 333.90 B: when his dad came home she would not only cook but she would um prepare his plate and um bring it to the table and if he wanted something while she was eating she'd jump up she'd go and get it 

333.82 337.30 B: you know and that's how he saw marriage so 

336.56 337.87 A: wow 

337.55 342.50 B: yeah so once we got marri- uh married it was just no that wasn't what i wanted 

341.92 344.11 A: no it isn't how long were you married 

343.82 345.27 B: ten years 

344.70 346.44 A: mhm and do you have any children 

346.27 349.36 B: mhm i have one son and 

349.73 354.34 B: thank goodness um he's not like his dad at all i think that 

354.59 356.62 B: not necessarily um 

357.03 371.85 B: the fact that you know we separated when he was so early but he's just he has a whole different kind of mind set he doesn't believe that um he he treats i think women as equals rather than thinking you know that 

360.39 361.50 A: mhm 

369.57 370.95 A: how nice 

370.99 372.37 A: and how old is he

382.62 393.35 A: actually chris'll be thirty five my youngest is thirty fi- ah thirty ah my youngest one has cerebral palsy he's disabled he he lives kind of independently in an apartment away from us and 

393.33 402.93 A: and my other son is a um graphic designer and he he's totally different than his father just totally you know he's very outgoing very 

404.15 411.34 A: a- a- a- actually when i talk to him now i go wow [laughter] i'm proud you know 

407.79 413.34 B: [laughter] 

411.39 412.09 A: (( i )) 

412.83 416.09 A: mean there were years where i didn't think that would be [laughter] 

415.04 419.06 B: [laughter] 

417.95 420.12 A: m- mhm it's amazing 

420.81 421.89 B: [laughter] 

421.89 424.41 A: so is your son in school then 

424.05 434.33 B: m- mhm he is and um he's going through right now a sort of i don't know what i want to do with myself sort of phase 

425.14 425.97 A: (( mm )) 

433.75 437.26 A: oh that's hard that's the age that it's hard to make that decision 

437.45 447.82 B: and you know i want to shake him and say um you know we've already planned what you're going to do just stick with the program but i have to like step i have to step away and go okay [laughter] 

443.80 445.42 A: [laughter] 

446.15 450.67 A: maybe he's changing his mind see he's going through his change now 

449.85 454.10 B: (( [laughter] right [laughter] )) 

456.05 466.10 B: ah yeah i guess all and all he turned out to be a a pretty good kid i'd look at you know some of the things that he could've gotten into and he could've done so 

466.15 470.35 B: i'm i'm fortunate i'm blessed you know that he's turned out the way he has 

470.38 474.51 B: i tell you though it was it was a it was a tough trip because 

473.94 475.27 A: oh yeah 

475.12 480.11 B: when you're raising a child on your own particularly a son 

478.29 479.37 A: right 

480.31 490.24 B: there just i talked to one of my friends at work today a younger girl who was telling me about her son asks her all these questions and she's 

490.52 499.48 B: just like floored that he's only nine years old and he's thinking about these things and i said you know just wait it's it's gonna get worse just 

498.91 499.98 A: yeah 

499.75 502.86 B: just wait till he starts dating you know and he's 

502.90 510.10 B: telling you this stuff that he feels comfortable telling you but you really don't want to hear [laughter] 

506.38 507.46 A: uh-huh 

507.85 515.03 A: uh-huh they sure do learn too early i think actually i think they sometimes start school too early these now 

514.12 517.07 B: [laughter] 

515.85 517.91 A: [laughter] i don't know it's just i 

519.54 521.07 A: it's interesting [laughter] 

520.76 522.27 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

522.92 530.49 B: so if i could go back in time i would i would have him but i wouldn't be married um [laughter] 

528.12 533.74 A: right [laughter] yeah th- that is something that i really do cherish for my kid it's just that 

533.90 536.94 A: (( you know same thing it's i ah )) 

536.95 550.53 A: i- i've always been like i said i've been in charge you know i paid the bills i've done everything now my husband's deciding well if i want to buy this i'll buy this if i want to but he's getting closer to retirement age he only has a few years and so all of a sudden 

550.85 558.00 A: he is thinks he's going to reward himself with everything and i'm going excuse me you know [laughter] 

556.88 561.42 B: [laughter] 

559.07 564.79 A: so it's so it's hard but there there again i guess he's finally growing up i don't know it's 

564.12 566.65 B: [laughter] 

565.63 567.52 A: [sigh] i don't know 

568.97 576.25 A: it's funny though we both think alike in that respect though i can't think of anything i can't think of too many other things i would change 

576.59 577.45 B: (( mm )) 

576.80 583.65 A: i think b- to having a son that's disabled i would like to know what it would have been like without hi- without 

583.50 588.90 A: you know him living an odd life 'cause i i didn't work i stayed home with him and i just 

588.70 599.89 A: when he finally moved out and both kids moved out i finally went to work but you know it's my life ah w- i sometimes think do you ever think what you would have done what what
