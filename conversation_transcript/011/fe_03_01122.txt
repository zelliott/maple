68.78 70.51 A: (( the the ah )) 

70.67 76.27 A: what i said was that i would probably not have moved away from

113.61 118.09 A: i guess we're supposed to talk about the reason why we would change it and 

118.28 119.24 A: pretty much 

119.68 120.57 A: well 

120.77 131.93 A: i w- [laughter] i've kind of had a little more time to think about it since ah since i talked to the last person but um the main thing is i it 

132.12 138.64 A: i think about is like if i would have stayed where i was well actually we lived ina small town 

138.74 142.92 A: um close to omaha springfield it's south of omaha 

143.11 147.79 A: and ah so it was a small community which most communities in omaha in ah 

148.93 151.32 A: nebraska are and ah 

151.98 159.76 A: you know with kind of a deal where you know everybody and everybody knows you and you know their aunts and uncles and cousins and everything else and [mn] 

156.08 156.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

160.07 163.62 A: it would have been kind of interesting if my daughter would have ah 

163.80 169.92 A: went to the same schools i went to had the same teachers i went to and all that kind of stuff and to you know 

170.59 172.42 A: just the comfort of 

172.49 174.40 A: kind of knowing everybody where 

174.42 178.76 A: where i live now i don't really know y- it's like the people you 

179.09 188.85 A: um grew up with you ne- once you're an adult it's kind of like i don't you meet people but they're it's never the same as the people you grew up with knowing 

188.86 189.83 A: to me 

189.72 196.77 B: yeah yeah i can i i've been in texas all my life but i grew up in houston and i moved to dallas ah 

198.06 200.13 B: when i was eighteen so 

200.53 204.81 B: even that much of a of a distance changed 

203.49 207.67 A: [noise] yeah when you're talking about texas [laughter] that's all yeah 

205.55 208.43 B: (( yeah i mean it's you know it's three hundred miles ))

209.41 210.53 B: and 

210.63 211.48 B: i 

211.50 221.41 B: there's there's almost nobody that i know from like my elementary school days and things i look around online every once in a while i i was in a when i was in first grade my school was blown up 

221.22 230.40 B: and in houston and i've only met one person that was there at the time that you know that remembers it and it's kind of been an interesting 

221.26 222.31 A: oh really 

228.42 229.33 A: (( [mn] hm )) 

230.67 233.84 B: thing to search but i don't i don't

283.56 284.51 A: um 

284.73 292.60 A: that's ah that's pretty much the main reason and i really like it here it's kind of like i wish i would have been born here 

293.69 304.99 A: you know that would have kind of solved the whole problem of not wanting to move then i would have already been where where i wanted to be but ah growing up where i wanted to be but ah because well i live close to san antonio so

399.14 403.90 B: yeah yeah didn't last very long and it was one of those i just kind of 

405.23 419.97 B: knew that in the back of mind i shouldn't but but both all of our parents wanted it so badly which now of course would be a much bigger red flag but [laughter] it might if it's if the parents are happy something's seriously wrong with this 

408.85 409.53 A: uh-huh 

411.24 412.21 A: uh-huh 

414.78 417.18 A: right [laughter] 

420.05 421.72 A: yeah 

420.39 428.09 B: [laughter] at least in my family but ah you know i- i don't all things considered i guess i was pretty lucky i mean he took 

422.12 423.39 A: yeah 

428.83 437.21 B: screwed up my credit forever and took most of my paintings but i you know i haven't seen him since and it's been over ten years so that's not bad

436.54 437.47 A: huh 

437.97 448.85 A: well my i've been married for twenty eight years and there if you would have asked me at a various times during that twenty eight years i probably would have said i wish i wouldn't have got married but ah 

448.95 450.14 A: (( it's ah )) 

450.38 452.80 A: it's all worked out and um 

454.56 459.76 A: you know after twenty eight years i've got him trained i was [laughter] i always tell people you know 

457.32 458.64 B: [laughter] 

459.85 463.68 A: after twenty eight years i've got him trained to at least do a few of the things that 

463.87 469.35 A: ah without having to ask him and ah a- actually my 

469.40 474.17 A: fibromyalgia came on after a car accident in ninety three 

472.50 473.31 B: oh 

474.23 476.82 A: and ah i really had a lot of trouble 

477.21 482.48 A: sin- with my health had all kinds of health problems since then and ah 

483.94 487.57 A: and i was used to always being the one to take care of everything you know 

486.97 500.37 B: yeah i do i mean that that's that's what makes me nuts is is i'm just it's so hard for me to ask for help i live by myself and i'm i'm real cl- i'm real shut in i just got a letter from the 

488.03 489.61 A: [laughter] 

495.45 496.59 A: mhm 

500.42 503.36 B: state services saying that they may cut off my home 

503.38 507.85 B: attendant which would mean i'd have to move into a nursing home and that's really daunting 

504.84 505.87 A: (( oh boy )) 

507.57 509.37 A: oh boy that's 

508.05 512.39 B: i just i like the illusion that i have some independence even though i really don't 

512.58 516.73 A: right yeah ah like i say i don't drive but at least 

516.91 520.35 A: i have my husband and my daughter to take me somewhere or um 

520.56 525.40 A: most of the time i don't feel like going anywhere and there every once in a while i'll 

525.58 532.04 A: if i feel like i can concentrate enough and whatever i'll drive a short distance but um 

533.06 535.10 A: it was really i mean i- 

535.45 537.05 A: it was really um 

538.43 553.13 A: a big change in my life because i was always the main wa- wage earner my my husband always pretty much did like construction work and stuff just on his own and ah i was the one with the benefits and everything and of course everything with my daughter 

553.13 556.26 A: he never really participated in anything 

556.38 557.60 A: (( and ah )) 

558.16 569.82 A: i did all of that and took care of the house and everything else but he always has mowed the lawn [laughter] i've never once mowed the lawn since we've been married so [laughter] yeah 

563.50 564.53 B: [laughter] 

567.36 570.19 B: oh wow so that's good i mean that's that's a 

570.62 572.05 A: but um 

571.16 572.73 B: not an easy thing 

572.65 576.69 A: mm [lipsmack] so ah yeah i know what you 

576.93 580.51 A: i ah sure you get feel like you're isolated 

580.57 595.46 B: i- in some ways i i do um i live kind of in a retirement community sort of apartment building so there's there's always people if i if i got lonely and you know there's usually people down the lobby talking or something but my whole life was at night all my life 

595.17 596.27 A: mm 

595.50 599.89 B: i wake up i come alive about ten at night and i worked in night clubs 

597.92 599.08 A: (( mhm ))
