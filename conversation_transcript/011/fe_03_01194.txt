220.56 226.32 A: well they say the person that you spend the rest of your life with is supposed to be your best friend but i really honestly believe that 

226.18 236.81 A: that's all well and good you should be able to tell them everything and not be afraid to you know hold anything back but i do believe when it comes to men there are some things that they're just not interested in hearing about 

235.98 236.75 B: right 

236.68 241.24 A: and that's where the best female friend comes in [laughter] 

238.71 248.09 B: [laughter] yeah i've had i've had some female friends that you know uh back when i was in college i had a female friend that 

248.41 251.22 B: you know i thought was my best friend and then 

251.23 260.26 B: it's just like some of some of your friends that you consider best friends want they are just taking the friendship they're not giving any back 

258.92 261.30 A: yeah just take take take 

260.95 264.60 B: mhm i had i had a good friend that was that way and 

264.44 277.97 B: uh now i've if i had been asked that question i think about the million dollars with with that particular person i probably would have taken the million there [laughter] that's that ugly to say but you know when it's that so one sided um 

270.08 273.49 A: (( right [laughter] [laughter] sure )) 

277.93 280.05 B: she had gone through a divorce 

280.44 287.35 B: and a it you know it was a it was a bad divorce uh her husband was a a physician and 

283.98 284.92 A: (( oh )) 

287.39 292.28 B: it it really was a bad situation he left her right around christmas 

292.35 293.57 B: and um 

293.68 298.23 B: i just kind of was there we went to the same aerobics class you know and 

298.24 310.16 B: uh i was kind of there and so she you know she needed someone to talk to and she would call me sometimes i was married at the time she would call me sometimes at two oclock in the morning 

310.45 320.50 B: and that wasn't good but you know i was always there for her and um got her through that and then my mom passed away which was a a very very 

318.57 319.63 A: (( oh no )) 

320.60 326.70 B: bad i mean i was very very close to my mom and she wasn't there for me you know 

325.84 327.19 A: (( [noise] right )) 

326.80 328.52 B: so it was um 

328.67 332.49 B: it was not a good situation there with a best friend but 

332.78 337.70 B: you you know you can have some friends that really are i guess they do not uh 

338.03 340.92 B: define the word best so 

340.80 347.61 A: my son has a female friend that he goes to school with he's sixteen she's sixteen 

347.73 357.17 A: and he just got his first real serious girlfriend and she is ironically had her just recently found her first serious boyfriend 

357.42 363.42 A: so and her good friend uh female friend is very 

366.41 367.30 A: hello 

367.00 368.08 B: are you there 

367.37 378.01 A: oh i'm sorry i'm here yeah her i'm sorry her um her good friend is very jealous that she's spending time with this boy now and likes to make her feel guilty 

368.54 369.65 B: okay 

378.06 381.01 A: and i explained to this young lady that you know 

381.06 382.93 A: for one i said you know 

383.24 390.14 A: she she may be your best friend now but is she your childhood best friend she goes oh no i that was somebody else so i said right 

390.19 390.92 B: (( mm yeah yeah )) 

390.21 400.19 A: and then when you go into college i said you know you may still hold a very good friendship with this person but you're gonna meet somebody new with different interests different you're gonna change 

400.15 408.16 A: and you might find a new best friend there and then maybe if you get married you know you'll find your new best friend in your husband 

408.25 413.56 A: i said and when you have babies you're gonna find a new best friend in the motherly department 

413.46 428.40 A: i said you're gonna have a lot of people that serve the categories in your life the best way possible and you know it's it's it's sad that you don't have the support of your friend now when things are really going good in your life and you're in la la land 

428.36 433.74 A: but you know you need to kind of keep it together and reassure this best friend of yours that you know 

433.66 436.24 A: um i still love you you're still my friend 

436.09 440.45 A: and you know just let let it let's see what happens from there 

440.30 452.27 A: and she was like oh i feel so much better [laughter] but you know i just like i just told her i said now that's coming from a woman with experience in life with friends i've lost a lot i've cried over a few 

442.63 443.85 B: (( [laughter] [mn] [mn] yeah yeah )) 

452.23 463.30 A: and i've been angry over several but i think ultimately the ones the best the best friend category really pertains to the person that knows you the best 

464.60 467.07 B: that's true that's true

511.05 512.06 A: right 

517.90 527.25 B: but a lot of them are so far away like uh like montgomery alabama that's just too far to go for a shop that's only going to pay like
