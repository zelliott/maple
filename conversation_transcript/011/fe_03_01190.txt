0.15 3.15 A: hi my name is tolin gaskins 

3.26 6.01 B: hi i'm alison tosibados 

7.08 8.14 B: um 

8.35 13.55 B: i would not take the money because my best best friend's very important to me 

14.22 15.38 B: (( and )) 

15.43 17.11 B: it would not be worth it [sigh] 

17.90 23.48 A: um i would not take the money because um i feel the same way as you do 

23.73 29.48 A: people are more important than things than money than prestige 

29.58 30.98 A: and um 

32.48 42.45 A: after all we get [mn] we actually um become successful in life by the people that influence our lives so i would not take the money either 

42.75 55.43 B: yeah um it's like more important to like be able to make your own money and make your own success in- instead of just having it handed to you and if you are you know value people 

57.09 58.33 B: it would be 

59.49 60.47 A: exactly 

59.67 61.26 B: (( to have the money handed to you )) 

61.50 67.36 A: i've never i've never never met a person that was just successful by money alone i think that um 

67.87 76.81 A: i think that a person is successful by treating others kindly and with love and um giving attention to 

76.96 81.08 A: um other situations and trying to help um 

81.52 86.77 A: i know people that have had lots of money um in their lifetime and 

87.85 95.81 A: they're not any better than anybody else that i've met um in fact i've found that some people with lots of money have um 

96.65 101.09 A: are are worse off [laughter] than those that don't have any at all [laughter] 

98.92 100.73 B: yeah [laughter] 

101.43 103.04 B: [sigh] yeah 

102.00 103.13 A: but um 

103.57 110.92 A: no i've i've often thought about that that question you know if i was given a lot of money what would i do with it and um 

111.23 119.01 A: that's one thing i definitely wouldn't do in fact i've often thought if i had money i would i would give it to others to try to help others 

119.08 128.98 A: and um definitely if you get a million dollars and you take a million dollars just to turn turn your best way- uh best friend away from you [laughter] um [laughter] 

127.05 128.09 B: [laughter] 

129.56 133.19 A: um it's it definitely wouldn't be helping at all 

133.43 134.66 B: that's true 

134.67 136.77 B: yeah like um 

137.11 148.42 B: my best friends like some of them don't even you know don't have that much money but they're like they'll give you you know any- anything you need you know anything that they can do they'll do it to help you and like sometimes people with more money 

148.40 153.91 B: are kind of like more stingy with their money and they just like 

154.81 158.93 B: i don't know i guess people without it value you know others more 

159.11 160.21 A: yeah 

159.32 160.66 B: that's more important 

160.40 169.22 A: you know that's what i've noticed too i've noticed like some people that have a lot lots of things and really haven't had to struggle and they have nice homes and 

169.10 181.06 A: really really expensive vehicles and everything is just perfect it seems like they lose touch with other people's feelings and just knowing how to be like down to earth with others around them 

181.16 184.57 A: um and i feel the same way you do um 

184.97 190.73 A: i've met people that basically had nothing um i lived overseas for probably about a year 

190.96 200.41 A: and some of the most caring loving people that i met um in this third world country that i was living in in the phillipines had very very little 

200.84 206.80 A: and i've also heard very tragic stories of people with a lot of money that um 

207.14 218.50 A: that use their money to do harmful things to like young children and things and like that not to say that somebody with a million dollars would do that but i think it just goes to show like 

210.96 211.99 B: (( uh-huh oh )) 

218.36 223.30 A: the aspect of what the average person or most people would um 

223.46 226.68 A: allow their circumstances to lead or guide them 

226.78 227.69 A: um 

226.97 229.79 B: yeah i think if you 

228.17 229.35 A: you know a million 

229.94 236.11 B: if you like earned your million dollars too that would be different than if you just you know received it because you w- 

235.97 247.32 B: you wouldn't you know you value things more when you actually have to work for them and just to like get a million dollars that you know for doing especially for doing a thing like not speaking to your best friend you know that's 

240.11 241.09 A: right 

246.20 247.17 A: (( mhm )) 

248.45 250.72 B: i don't think a nice person would actually do that [laughter] 

250.51 251.42 A: right 

251.77 255.31 A: yeah um i often wonder sometimes about um 

255.32 263.92 A: some of these reality shows [laughter] even you know what extent will people go just to win money or gain a spot on um national television 

257.86 260.57 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

263.59 265.34 B: [laughter] really 

264.62 275.09 A: and it's like you know some people will degrade themselves just to go that far just to get some type of notoriety or prestige or publicity or population or whatever 

275.01 276.83 B: yeah 

275.35 276.28 A: um 

278.26 281.37 A: yeah um [laughter] 

279.43 286.06 B: yeah [laughter] um let's see what else um well 

286.58 289.81 B: i guess a million dollars 

290.51 292.50 B: oh okay like i value 

293.15 307.26 B: my best friend probably more than a million dollars just because of you know every time that i've needed something it's not really like i don't really always need money i you know mostly need someone to talk to or someone like that and if i could just 

307.73 309.84 B: like if i had to just give that up 

310.10 315.46 B: it really wouldn't be worth it because you know it's like love is more you know valuable than money is 

315.43 322.64 A: right and in the end if you have all this money and you don't have your friends or your family to surround you and love you 

322.76 328.36 A: um what have you really gained you've just gained something material and you can't take the money with you 

324.67 325.93 B: exactly 

328.71 334.16 A: um you can't take a million dollars with you but you can take friendships with you wherever you go 

334.27 335.29 B: mhm 

334.58 335.56 A: um 

336.17 341.30 A: and i personally i i value um i believe in you know an afterlife um 

341.00 341.84 B: (( right )) 

341.39 348.99 A: and i believe that you know the relationships that we establish now will be carried over in an afterlife so 

349.33 351.29 A: with that in mind um 

352.69 365.97 A: you know if we need that person in heaven [laughter] you know years from now or whenever you know i think that we'll look back on the times that we had here on earth and we'll think to ourselves well you know i'm really sorry for the way i treated you and 

356.33 358.62 B: yeah [laughter] 

366.01 369.24 A: i'm really sorry that i didn't do this and didn't do that i would 

369.39 371.89 A: i would rather um 

371.94 375.04 A: live with no regrets as much as possible 

375.50 387.09 A: than to have money and a million dollars and granted too i mean that can go tomorrow if i knew exactly where to spend that million dollars 

379.64 380.25 B: [laughter] 

386.07 390.90 B: [laughter] exactly a million isn't that much in today's world [laughter] 

387.14 388.45 A: [laughter] 

389.69 395.84 A: exactly i mean a person over their lifetime will make more than a willion oh more than a million dollars but [laughter] 

394.46 396.08 B: (( [laughter] exactly [noise] )) 

396.07 399.43 A: you know they just won't make it at one time and 

399.35 400.63 B: right 

400.25 401.24 A: um 

402.51 403.79 A: yeah 

403.97 405.03 A: to me 

404.27 405.16 B: uh 

405.70 406.55 A: mhm 

405.96 406.97 B: (( you go ahead )) 

406.64 408.16 A: okay [laughter] 

407.43 409.04 B: [laughter] 

408.29 409.20 A: um 

411.06 412.10 A: well 

412.42 421.65 A: i guess it's back to you know what i what i was thinking about i've known some of the most kindest nicest people that had 

421.98 423.35 A: almost nothing 

423.47 424.38 B: yeah 

424.37 431.16 A: and uh that really teaches you a lot um and it shows you that money is not everything 

431.23 434.77 A: like when i went to this third world country 

434.82 439.68 A: of course i never left the u._s. before and i was thinking to myself oh man i'm so glad to you 

439.75 444.47 A: know get out of the u._s. and everything and experience something new 

441.61 442.47 B: uh-huh 

444.98 447.52 A: and i saw a lot of poverty around me 

447.63 450.28 A: but one thing i saw too was that 

450.39 454.92 A: these people loved their families and even though they had little 

453.04 453.90 B: right 

455.24 463.68 A: they were w- with their families every night the husbands provided for the wives the wives worked just as hard as the husbands um 

464.05 467.05 A: the children were always smiling for the most part 

467.61 468.95 A: and uh 

469.74 478.20 A: that that just says a lot [cough] and i think too in their mind they would never trade anything for that 

478.13 479.50 B: exactly 

478.20 485.72 A: like some of these people you know they work really hard and sure they could have gone to the city and gotten themselves you know high paying jobs 

486.12 496.46 A: and uh gotten an education gotten degrees and really really tried to work hard but then what would they have had they would have had less time with their families 

494.14 495.00 B: right 

496.42 505.41 B: right i i see how that is and it's it's interesting because you know i really like i really want to work hard so that i can make a lot of money and 

505.74 510.46 B: everything but like the situation you're given it's just it's kind of like saying that 

510.63 517.34 B: um you know money is everything and like i realise that you know i'm working hard i want you know to make a lot of money but 

517.26 529.09 B: wh- like i want to bring my you know family with me i want to be able to share that with them and you know my friends and everything and be able to you know give back to the community and you know be a good person but you know 

529.45 534.63 B: be you know be wealthy and be able to have you know different uh 

535.34 539.46 B: different things whatever i want you know a nice house a nice car et cetera 

539.61 540.46 B: so 

541.08 544.80 B: yeah i see how it's money isn't everything 

545.12 545.96 B: but 

546.66 550.32 B: i also think it is you know important and everything to 

551.34 552.20 B: uh 

552.65 560.93 B: to have like i would not like to live in a third world country [laughter] because of that lack of everything even if it is more family oriented 

560.93 563.76 A: i think you brought up a good point too that um 

563.86 566.87 A: you know people will appreciate things more 

566.89 568.82 A: if they work for it 

568.42 569.57 B: exactly 

569.06 570.37 A: and um 

571.34 578.10 A: it's like if you if you just if you're just given a million dollars you'll be i think the average person 

578.16 582.51 A: not everybody but the average person would be more apt to just go out and spend it 

582.53 583.36 B: right 

583.09 584.31 A: and um 

585.14 587.85 A: and just do things that they shouldn't do with it 

585.46 586.23 B: yeah 

588.12 595.04 A: but if you know that it took you ten years or five years or however long and you worked really really hard 

588.34 589.18 B: yes 

593.88 594.87 B: mhm 

595.14 598.47 A: and you had the support of your family and friends too behind you 

598.62 599.89 A: while you made that money
