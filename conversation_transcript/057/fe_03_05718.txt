25.75 36.43 A: [noise] [mn] [lipsmack] ah well um it's a little tough to understand their robot speech i i think it said [lipsmack] ah w- we're supposed to discuss foreign relations 

36.67 45.67 A: [sigh] and ah discuss if any other country is a t- threat to u._s. security [sigh] i i think that's what i h- heard i'm not sure 

44.36 47.14 B: yeah that's what i heard too yeah 

46.54 54.01 A: [sigh] i'm not sure why they said the word any other country or or like what was the first country 

53.97 59.76 B: i guess iraq i guess they implying iraq i guess i don't know but it wasn't you're right it wasn't very clear 

57.18 59.17 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] i i suppose )) 

59.41 61.42 A: ah y- yeah 

62.14 63.63 B: (( [sigh] [noise] you know it's kind of iffy )) 

63.40 68.81 A: [sigh] [noise] well um a- ah how do you feel do we have any foreign relation problems or 

68.93 72.48 A: [sigh] d- diplomatic problems that are not working out so 

73.17 75.76 B: well i i mean i think a lot of 

74.21 76.69 A: (( well )) 

76.33 78.56 B: the world in general is 

78.61 80.82 B: seems to be fairly u- 

81.96 87.15 B: unhappy with a lot of the stuff the u._s. does anyway i mean i guess it's whether you look at it [sigh] 

87.44 89.36 B: (( as a narrow thing or if it's a )) 

89.53 92.24 B: is it just a thr- you k- know something that's a 

92.77 105.41 B: a threat like someone's gonna be bombing us or is it a threat that like [sigh] people are you k- know going to have such a negative impression of the u._s. that they're not going to be very cooperative about about things 

104.83 116.41 A: [noise] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] [lipsmack] ah yes a- actually what what puzzles me a lot [sigh] an- and it was in the news a good deal ah a- ah several months ago [sigh] this ah m- minor to do 

116.50 131.49 A: [sigh] t- that washington had with [sigh] germany and france [lipsmack] just b- before washington began the war in iraq [mn] and there was a good deal of p- publicity about how those two nations were not willing to support washington 

125.68 126.41 B: (( oh )) 

131.78 136.09 A: (( [lipsmack] a- and were agitating in the ah security council )) 

135.93 146.96 A: [sigh] that t- the u._n. should not [sigh] authorize t- the use of force in iraq [sigh] [mn] and ah you know washington r- really gave it a lot of publicity 

141.80 142.83 B: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

146.06 147.15 B: (( yeah [noise] y- )) 

146.76 161.24 A: [mn] [sigh] a- ah and you know we knew it i mean there was no way you could escape it it was constant a- ah a barrage of [sigh] publicity o- out of washington [sigh] claiming that we're not being supported by our former allies and [sigh] so on and so forth 

161.10 169.82 A: [sigh] and yet my thought was what what do they want me to do am i supposed to go out in t- the street and have fist fights with them 

169.02 170.42 B: yeah [laughter] 

169.89 175.68 A: [sigh] ah you know i m- mean t- that's diplomatic relations you people work it out that's why we pay taxes 

175.48 176.66 B: yeah yeah 

175.93 184.76 A: [sigh] an- and support you ah in the state department and defen- [sigh] w- what are you all this publicity and l- like as though i'm supposed to do something about it [sigh] [noise] 

184.45 195.74 B: yeah yeah and i the i was reading in t- the actually in the new york times that how that [sigh] they put a lot of pressure on india to try to and a lot of like incentives to have [sigh] peacekeeping troops in ah 

195.54 200.89 B: [sigh] in iraq now and that they i guess well said they're gonna not send them today so [sigh] 

200.92 203.42 B: that they ah it was too much anti 

203.49 205.01 B: american 

205.27 211.28 B: f- feeling in in india that they thought they might lose some of their elections the party that's in power so they [sigh] 

211.04 217.03 B: even though they got a lot of [sigh] ah pressure to do it [sigh] a lot of [sigh] you know they got to meet the president when they were over here and they were 

216.79 229.22 B: you know being treated all [sigh] diplomatically at a higher level that it was not you know they decided it was not a good idea unless they get a [sigh] u._n. vote or something that the u._n.'s gonna take over peacekeeping in iraq and everything [sigh] 

228.47 233.21 A: [sigh] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [sigh] [noise] [noise] r- right yeah [sigh] it it's um i don't know it's all very puzzling 

233.25 238.46 A: [mn] and washington doesn't seem to be doing a very good job of ah [sigh] figuring out ah 

238.78 242.82 A: w- w- who are our allies and who are our enemies and what's t- the difference 

242.74 244.06 B: (( um )) 

242.94 247.46 A: [mn] i mean you know it's up to them to figure this out and try to cultivate our allies [noise] 

247.96 249.54 B: yeah that's true 

250.26 254.29 A: (( but [lipsmack] they don't seem to be doing a good job of it [mn] [noise] [noise] )) 

250.28 251.92 B: it seems like it's 

253.24 255.25 B: no no it's kind of ah [sigh] 

255.82 259.89 B: kind of out there and i think part of the problems people are just kind of puzzled with what's 

260.18 262.71 B: what's going on you know that it's ah 

264.12 267.98 B: you know what the intent of this iraq thing is and [noise] [noise] 

268.15 270.98 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] i i always figured with these [noise] 

271.55 272.86 A: (( [sigh] a- ah [mn] )) 

272.73 278.39 A: bilateral relations that we sometimes have with [sigh] specific nations 

278.16 292.14 A: [lipsmack] a- ah like you mention the part about our t- trying to [sigh] persuade india [sigh] to ah contribute peacekeeping forces [sigh] and then earlier in the year there was a- ah pressure on 

292.42 294.30 A: (( [sigh] ah pakistan )) 

294.35 301.45 A: [lipsmack] to ah step into some of those rebel areas [sigh] where terrorists were said to be hiding 

301.42 309.76 A: [lipsmack] ah i've always had the sneaking suspicion [lipsmack] a lot of that depended on how much money we were w- willing to pay the foreign government 

309.04 311.37 B: (( uh-hum [sigh] i think )) 

310.37 315.61 A: [noise] give them t- trade benefits and they'll do it give them a little more and they'll do it even quicker [sigh] [sigh] 

315.58 318.29 B: yeah well that was certainly the the the 

318.45 323.19 B: what end up with that stuff with turkey although i guess they didn't vote really to do it even after 

323.58 327.39 B: they thought they'd given them like fifteen billion or something like that 

326.33 335.44 A: [lipsmack] ah yes that w- was another example they were so highly p- publicized and they kept emphasizing the foreign aid that we w- would t- throw their way 

335.63 342.89 A: [sigh] and this and that and um [mn] maybe we didn't ah throw enough money at them i i i don't quite know what the problem is but [sigh] 

340.58 341.47 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

342.91 346.87 A: um t- these initiatives don't seem to all be succeeding [noise] [noise] [noise] 

346.70 348.95 B: no no it it's kind of 

349.40 356.43 B: well this whole iraq thing is kind of puzzling as to [sigh] it seems unclear as to what t- the threat was and how much of it [sigh] w- 

356.72 364.02 B: was a t- threat and how much of it more that they were making an example out of iraq just to [sigh] i mean i've hear- heard the theory 

358.88 360.31 A: (( [sigh] [noise] [sigh] [noise] )) 

364.56 368.07 B: propounded that in some ways it's intentional that the other y- 

368.35 372.52 B: you know arab states other countries are going to say hey look america [sigh] y- 

372.76 379.41 B: y- you know [laughter] w- went and t- took iraq and iraq didn't r- really recently do anything that was that 

380.01 390.25 B: out of the out of the ordinary potentially i mean yeah they were they're a negative country i guess but it's like [sigh] it's just they're doing it more to get a general revenge on the arab world or something and [sigh] 

389.36 389.92 A: (( [noise] )) 

390.13 395.12 B: the other countries that maybe they need to get in line you know and not do too much or report 

392.94 405.62 A: [sigh] [noise] [noise] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] a- ah yes i've heard that a- ah yeah [sigh] afghanistan this month [sigh] u- um [lipsmack] iraq next month [sigh] w- who will be next w- will it be one of us ah we better behave this that and the other [sigh] 

396.18 396.98 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

405.60 406.82 B: e- exactly 

405.62 411.48 A: i've ah i've heard that a- as a possible ah [sigh] explanation 

411.97 417.94 A: [sigh] um [lipsmack] i would have probably been willing to believe it too actually before t- the w- war in iraq started [sigh] 

417.97 425.84 A: um i- it t- the ah the administration really didn't impress me with their r- reasons [sigh] for going to war up front [mn] 

427.02 437.90 A: [sigh] a- ah but then i t- thought about something and i realized maybe there's more to it t- than meets the eye [lipsmack] you know ah the administration kept [sigh] 

437.93 442.28 A: um h- harping on these weapons of mass destruction 

442.36 443.31 B: (( uh-hum )) 

442.40 447.26 A: [mn] we're searching for them we know they have them they're hiding them they're this that and the other 

448.54 452.57 A: [lipsmack] and then i t- thought well maybe the r- reason 

452.94 459.93 A: [sigh] washington is so [sigh] f- firm in it's claim that iraq really does have these weapons 

460.00 469.42 A: [sigh] and maybe the reason washington is so determined [sigh] to stay there until they find t- them [sigh] maybe it's actually true 

469.45 470.52 B: (( uh-hum )) 

470.22 480.29 A: [sigh] [sigh] maybe they h- have these weapons in i- iraq [sigh] and maybe [sigh] we were the stupid jackasses [sigh] who gave it to t- them in the first place 

480.51 481.44 B: (( mm y- )) 

481.04 489.11 A: [sigh] [sigh] maybe that's why we know what we're looking for [sigh] because we kept t- the list of what we gave them twenty years ago when they were fighting the russians 

489.12 490.70 B: yeah that's true 

490.46 495.46 A: [sigh] so a- ah and and of course nobody wants to admit t- that we gave away [sigh] 

495.24 506.00 A: those weapons to such an unstable country [sigh] but it might be that between the defence department and the state department [sigh] they have the original r- receipt of what we gave them 

505.23 507.42 B: (( [mn] [laughter] yeah it's possible )) 

505.99 511.55 A: [sigh] and they know we gave we gave them ten of these and seven of these and nine of these and four of those [sigh] so where the hell are they 

511.50 513.54 B: yeah well yeah that's true 

511.80 512.72 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

512.60 521.83 A: but nobody wants to admit it so you know we'll do this round about diplomatic dance we think they're there we think they're here they're in the sand they're in the desert [sigh] 

521.60 529.26 A: but nobody wants to actually say we know they have it because [sigh] we're the ones who gave all those weapons to them in the first place years ago [sigh] 

529.23 538.87 B: uh-hum [noise] uh-hum that's true that's that's very possible i think i think there's something going on i don't think the full story's out there certainly of what [sigh] exactly is going on 

531.32 533.80 A: (( [lipsmack] so i i [sigh] )) 

537.05 542.72 A: a- ah y- yeah um it it j- just doesn't seem to g- gel properly 

542.87 552.19 A: [sigh] a- ah you know that we make such e- extravagant claims [sigh] then they get there it's a it's a walk over there's very little resistance and yet [sigh] 

551.99 558.37 A: they can't find what they say they're looking for very puzzling [mn] not a big country you know [sigh] 

556.08 557.00 B: (( uh-hum )) 

558.53 559.92 B: yeah that's true 

559.61 565.59 A: so l- like w- w- what's the deal a- a- and you know i heard something very interesting before this all began 

565.74 572.10 A: [sigh] a- ah it was a news report ah with regard to where these weapons might be [sigh] hidden 

572.51 578.68 A: [sigh] and the ah the writer quoted israeli intelligence 

579.04 586.03 A: [sigh] ah sources as saying [sigh] oh it's quite obvious they shifted everything across the border into syria 

586.05 587.01 B: uh-huh 

586.49 591.38 A: the united states is simply looking in the wrong direction it's over the border on the other side [noise] 

591.27 592.33 B: (( uh-hum )) 

592.45 593.76 B: that's true [noise] 

593.47 599.89 A: [lipsmack] and the israelis seem to ah [lipsmack] [cough] know a lot about what's going on there they're sure closer to the action than we are
