7.26 9.06 A: how are you my name's ashley 

8.98 10.60 B: ashley how's it going man 

10.06 14.93 A: decent enough i mean i'm in new york it's kind of hot and sticky right now what's it like where you are 

14.12 19.88 B: oh yeah um it's all right actually it's really really windy today i'm in col- i'm in denver [sigh] 

19.26 22.65 A: (( you're in denver that figures you're easily into the afternoon uh )) 

20.73 22.18 B: yeah it's been it's been 

22.56 23.96 B: what's that 

23.23 25.10 A: you're easily into the afternoon 

24.59 28.15 B: uh yes yes it's been hot lately but but we're nice today 

27.19 31.20 A: oh cool so so what do you think about computers in education anyway 

28.54 29.64 B: so uh 

31.01 36.26 B: um i think uh computers are a real necessary part of education they help me out a lot 

35.88 36.78 A: uh-huh 

36.57 46.16 B: yeah like i'm a college student right now and uh i basically don't see how i could get by without [sigh] without um the use of computers [mn] 

37.75 42.29 A: (( is )) 

45.55 49.52 A: (( that because of the internet or just for typing essays and making notes )) 

48.56 54.00 B: um i think it's both i still research a lot through like books 

53.80 55.15 A: (( mhm )) 

54.06 56.87 B: and such but internet research is good 

56.51 63.57 A: yeah definitely i i missed out on that i um i left sch- college in the eighties and then i i did a masters in the early nineties 

63.76 65.07 A: but um 

65.09 71.22 A: you know in terms of even looking up anything that you want to you know the int- the internet is a- an incredible resource you know 

70.79 74.09 B: oh yeah definitely [mn] i think uh [mn] 

74.10 86.43 B: i think a lot of like poorer schools and inner city schools really miss out because they don't have the computers they they need for for education it's really something that we need to adapt to like [sigh] 

81.50 82.28 A: mhm 

86.37 91.57 B: i i think quicker than we are i think we're ragging a little behind as a society [sigh] 

92.34 100.55 A: and too i mean do y- you think that um kids who use computers are [mn] are smarter than those without them 

92.55 93.25 B: (( and it )) 

99.21 107.26 B: um i don't know if they're necessarily smarter but they have more opportunities to learn obviously you know what i mean 

105.91 106.79 A: mhm 

107.22 114.26 B: it doesn't make for for a smarter kid because [sigh] you know that that's tough to gauge as it is but 

112.88 120.36 A: but i remember when i was growing up there's there was a big controversy as to whether we would be allowed to use calculators 

118.67 121.56 B: (( um [sigh] but ha oh yeah )) 

120.95 127.11 A: uh because people were afraid you know y- you know if don't know what six your six times tables or whatever [laughter] 

126.59 130.42 B: oh yeah well i mean i i can see that and i can see how [sigh] 

130.62 134.96 B: like the internet and uh computers can pose problems and like 

135.13 138.47 B: maybe create almost like a a sort of laziness [sigh] 

137.90 146.79 A: (( yeah i i [noise] is there i mean i i think that uh the benefits certainly outweigh the the the disadvantages like that )) 

138.56 139.27 B: (( i )) 

140.36 141.21 B: yeah 

145.29 152.01 B: yeah yeah i think so too i think that i mean you can't just ignore the benefits forever because you're afraid of 

152.22 155.13 B: of what bad might come of it [mn] 

154.42 155.25 A: mhm 

155.74 156.70 B: um 

158.10 161.28 B: (( [noise] y- yeah do you do any continued education right now )) 

161.31 166.77 A: um no i i don't i mean i i'm in sales so i go to the odd seminar you know 

166.49 167.58 B: yes 

166.70 173.50 A: um but other than that not re- i mean i use the computer every day in work you know um 

171.62 172.59 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

173.41 187.75 A: so u- i use databases like for um you know contact management and then j- just for seeing what's happening i work in i work in the finance area so it's it's pretty important because if if something happens you know greenspan says something or 

181.80 182.36 B: (( [mn] )) 

187.10 188.52 B: [laughter] yeah 

188.29 200.94 A: you know what i mean um so having up to date information's very important so we have a couple of news services as well which is which is which is pretty handy um which is something that you know you wouldn't have had like twenty years ago 

194.94 196.09 B: oh yeah 

197.44 198.62 B: yeah 

201.04 208.04 A: um yeah the the wire information so you know it's it's certainly changed the nature of the job too and y- y- you know you 

201.14 202.64 B: yeah exactly 

208.42 210.16 A: you know it's um 

210.75 218.58 A: you can tell when the market's moving and you know what the hell's happening you know um so that's yeah 

213.92 218.01 B: oh yeah yeah that that can be a big help in i think that 

218.12 221.61 B: i think that u- like using computers in education like o- 

221.68 230.99 B: starting young in like grade school and stuff is important because you know computers are such uh they're you know they're pervading every part of society so 

229.75 242.64 A: (( yeah it it's amazing consider my friends like i i'm in my mid thirties but they they you know they've like five year old six year old kids and they're still learning you know with computers also you know they they learn and the alphabet that way or )) 

242.22 243.47 B: oh yeah 

242.90 251.06 A: (( you know they're learn- they're learning to add um and you know they [noise] when i grew up there were there were kind of all computers were useful is for you know games )) 

250.90 251.87 B: yeah 

251.16 254.00 A: (( you know th- um this was in the you know the eighties )) 

253.97 263.44 A: um but now it it it's it's com- it it's it's completely changed and you know they they like playing with it and they have their own little ones and you know it's it's um 

263.38 273.09 A: i mean the thing i missed out on was that i- i'm abso- like computerly computer illiterate you know i i don't h- i don't know h. t. m. l. or how to make a website or anything like that [sigh] 

267.83 268.89 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

273.10 279.70 A: and uh i suppose i've been lazy you know i've i've no real desire to uh [mn] to do it you know 

279.07 291.29 B: yeah i'm i'm the same like i don't know how to do any of that stuff i just know [sigh] basic research skills and and you know typing and stuff like that and i think [mn] i don't know i i feel like i could benefit from knowing more so [noise] 

290.47 298.31 A: yeah i mean basically it's like i know how to drive a car but i i couldn't build a car engine you know and [laughter] it's just the same sort of analogy um 

294.71 296.10 B: yeah [laughter] 

297.50 298.88 B: yeah that's good 

298.36 306.16 A: you know i mean i know my way round a lot of the software [noise] packages but in terms of the technical aspects of it uh i'm an out and out disaster you 

305.59 308.60 B: yeah yeah i'm [mn] i am as well i think 

309.10 311.45 B: i think that can be prevented by by 

311.59 316.57 B: addressing the advances in technology with like younger children you know like 

314.86 320.43 A: know yeah but i think that unless you grow up with computers you're not a sort of computer phobic if you like 

320.44 322.72 A: um you know which 

322.64 330.88 A: like people like kind of fifteen years older than i have like i've even noticed in work wouldn't be as comfortable with a computer as i am and that even 

328.87 329.89 B: yeah 

330.69 338.08 A: the little kids that i see you know just take to it like a duck to water um which which is kind of an an interesting thing you know 

337.85 339.64 B: yeah yeah it is interesting 

340.03 341.24 B: (( yeah [mn] [cough] )) 

342.55 345.63 A: mhm so i mean wh- wh- what are you studying 

344.51 348.40 B: um i'm studying linguistics and ethnic studies 

347.93 349.53 A: oh really oh okay 

349.31 357.10 B: yeah that's uh that's what i'm that's what i'm working on it's it's tough and pretty much boring for anyone that isn't really into it but 

356.58 362.30 A: well it's like that for everything linguistics is pretty easy er well it's not pretty easy but it it's pretty interesting i i did that for a bit 

362.22 363.20 B: oh yeah 

362.32 366.33 A: oh yeah my undergrad degree was in philosophy and uh classical history 

366.03 367.21 B: oh that's cool 

366.41 369.27 A: but but um i took a big part in uh lingw- 

369.63 371.24 A: linguistic philosophy 

371.15 372.20 B: yeah 

371.61 374.51 A: um which was like bechtenstein um 

374.63 379.03 A: and who else was it i forget it was it was a long time ago like fifteen years ago 

377.90 378.82 B: yeah 

378.94 379.83 B: yeah 

379.14 389.18 A: but um it w- i remember being it was syntax and um the game theory i think was the but are you are you into the phonetics end of it as well or 

387.71 397.60 B: i'm yeah i'm i'm really into syntax um quite a bit i'm just i honestly just acquired this major i'm going into my second year as an undergrad and uh 

396.57 397.41 A: uh-huh 

397.60 409.56 B: um [mn] i just acquired this major because i took a a course that i liked and i've i've read a bunch of books on it like i read linguistics books in high school like chomsky and and all that stuff and um 

407.41 409.34 A: right 

409.83 413.98 A: yeah i saw him he was the um i'm originally from ireland but he showed up there a couple of times 

414.02 418.50 A: uh he was a very very bright guy and you know he very 

414.17 415.20 B: oh yeah 

415.99 417.36 B: oh yeah 

418.44 430.11 A: very talented man you can even tell it y- you know when he even when he was just in a in in casual discussion but uh yeah i mean uh i can say the thing about colleges certainly just get as drunk as you can and uh 

424.49 425.72 B: oh yeah 

429.21 430.58 B: [laughter] 

430.40 433.90 A: yeah do something that you like you know because 

432.11 435.05 B: yeah yeah i'm working on that you know [mn] 

433.92 436.73 A: you know because at the end of it y- you know 

436.96 439.58 A: you're you're three years or four years whatever you do 

439.72 445.04 A: you're you're not going to remember what you did in five years time and what you are going to remember is the friendships 

445.12 446.52 B: yeah 

445.14 446.04 A: you know 

446.22 450.43 A: and um y- most employers really don't give a toss what you have you 

450.62 458.49 B: yeah that's good advice yeah i'm i'm working on that just having a good time be living with a bunch of friends in in a big house next year and [mn] 

450.66 451.79 A: (( know [mn] )) 

456.20 457.90 A: yeah 

457.90 470.25 A: oh great yeah and uh yeah because i found that that you probably learn more from your friends than you will by you know attending every single lecture and uh you know having discussions afterwards that type of thing 

458.81 460.00 B: yeah 

469.88 471.61 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] yeah it )) 

470.21 474.17 A: than um than you do by you know just going 

473.02 475.54 B: wor- it worked for you huh 

475.56 489.22 A: it did actually yeah i mean i um i you know arts was kind of uh an easy subject to do because a lot of it you know you're meant to do by yourself you know so you had um like i think i had eight hours of lectures every week 

477.01 478.00 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

484.98 485.87 B: yeah 

489.29 496.71 A: um over the whole week and the rest was divided to um you know you were meant to do reading in the library whatever 

490.43 491.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] oh wow )) 

496.50 497.45 B: (( yes [noise] [noise] )) 

496.63 509.86 A: and my my friends doing commerce you know which is business studies and engineering and they'd like thirty five forty five hours of lectures a week and they they were sweating it you know we had eight hours and um you could kind of structure it so you only had a two day week 

509.63 514.78 B: [noise] [noise] wow yeah that's good yeah i had a three day week last semester and that was that was awesome 

509.97 513.08 A: [laughter] 

514.25 516.72 A: (( yeah )) 

514.91 519.58 B: i mean i like going to school and all but but uh you know got 

518.41 532.15 A: but i mean i i i'd still go up to college but you know you'd still be hanging around but you just wouldn't be studying [laughter] [laughter] you know so socially socially it was uh it was fun and i was inter- i was interested in that stuff too 

524.95 526.10 B: oh yeah 

526.29 527.53 B: definitely 

532.07 540.94 A: you know whereas i'd guys friends of mine doing engineering and they just hated it and um they ended up just scraping through whereas because i liked it and i was interested in this 

535.97 537.10 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

541.11 543.29 A: (( you know i uh you know )) 

541.20 548.55 B: yeah that's why i'd acquired the major that i did you know like i i had a friend that was in business and and he just 

548.58 555.60 B: just wasn't liking it at all and it was really hard for him to make it to class and uh i don't know i just figure i i 

555.67 561.16 B: don't know i'm not really that concerned about a career or anything i just kind of want to have a good time with my life 

560.63 571.68 A: yeah see if you have a good time you get good grades you know it's you you're better off doing that um than you know cramming business for four years hating it and you know just scraping by you know 

569.70 572.20 B: [laughter] yeah definitely [mn] 

571.71 586.35 A: um y- y- you have more fun that way and you m- make more friends if you're happier as you know as a person and f- even the even when we're hiring now y- you kind of look at the grades more so necessarily than you know what the um what they're in 

586.11 587.12 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

586.45 590.12 A: you know and also you'd kind of see what ex- what sort of extra curricula 

590.78 591.75 B: yeah 

590.88 592.83 A: activities are going on you know 

592.70 593.94 B: for sure [mn] 

593.47 599.95 A: and then what else do you look for i mean you pretty much look to see will the person fit in because the majority of people can do a given job anyway
