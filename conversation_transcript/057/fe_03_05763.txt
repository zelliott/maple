0.30 1.46 A: hello 

1.34 2.86 B: hello 

3.08 4.98 A: ah this is aaron 

4.86 7.07 B: ah my name's mike how's it going 

7.16 8.80 A: pretty good yourself 

8.55 12.05 B: um i'm all right i'm all right where're you from aaron 

11.95 13.73 A: i'm from indiana 

13.62 15.48 B: okay i'm from ohio 

16.82 17.92 A: (( all right )) 

16.83 18.17 B: (( so ah )) 

18.65 21.07 A: [laughter] laptops in education 

20.84 25.52 B: yeah yeah so wha- well what do you think about computers 

25.70 35.12 A: (( ah well as far as ah computers in education are concerned i've ben- i've benefited pretty well through mine um we have )) 

27.52 28.08 B: (( [sigh] )) 

34.80 36.71 B: yeah how how old are you 

36.69 40.70 A: (( i'm well i'm a college student )) 

42.19 43.04 A: you 

43.22 47.74 B: yeah i i'm i'm in college so you know i'm early twenties 

48.00 50.40 B: yeah it's definitely helped me out i guess 

48.15 49.08 A: gotcha 

50.78 51.92 B: (( so ah )) 

52.45 55.15 B: [lipsmack] yeah i i wouldn't be able to 

55.34 58.35 B: get to get through school without it i guess 

59.38 61.98 B: use it for everything but ah 

62.94 67.74 B: yeah i don't know what do you think about like in in ah high schools and that 

67.62 68.86 A: (( um )) 

69.12 79.15 A: (( i in high school we didn't have enough of the ah computer emphasis you know i went to college and it was overwhelming how ah how ah emphasized it was )) 

79.75 81.60 B: yeah 

81.92 86.06 B: all right yeah see i don't know how effective it is in high schools for people 

86.16 87.80 B: i don't know that you can 

88.34 91.54 B: get like student- young students to ah 

91.88 95.06 B: you know participate in it i don't know if they'll be interested 

96.90 98.02 A: well it's part of 

101.97 102.68 A: (( the )) 

102.32 105.94 B: shit can you hear me i can't hear you you're breaking up 

105.44 106.71 A: oh i'm sorry 

107.38 109.14 A: (( [noise] um [noise] )) 

108.77 109.92 B: oh that's better 

109.17 122.31 A: as as far as with like math math and science and what not ah its a critical tool that you know you you'd use in college you know and ah it it'd be beneficial to help ah to start 

113.13 114.27 B: yeah 

122.16 127.27 A: at least earlier in high school um using computer aided stuff 

127.13 132.52 B: yeah yeah i see like you need the basic skills and things like that ah i 

132.91 140.67 B: just think it's hard like in a class of thirty people to try and teach you know especially schools that don't have thirty computers 

140.89 147.43 B: you know how are you gonna go about teaching each kid how to use it you know it's more hands on you can't just show them 

148.37 149.23 A: yeah 

148.51 151.51 B: so that's that's a problem i see with that [cough] 

152.41 165.63 A: and another issue as far as use- use in high schools is funding you know not every school corporation has funding enough to supply it you know just for instance a classroom full of laptops or desk tops mm 

165.02 167.84 B: absolutely absolutely 

168.89 169.95 B: so 

170.45 174.25 B: yeah i mean it's it's effective if you have it but 

174.70 176.78 B: it's a matter of getting it to everyone 

178.49 181.13 B: so yeah what do you think about those ah 

181.39 188.56 B: education you know like go through college on the computer like you don't even have to go class or any of that 

188.57 191.95 A: ugh like ah i think it was arizona ah 

191.82 194.04 B: yeah university of phoenix 

193.68 205.10 A: phoenix the university of phoenix online i i don't know i i think there's a lot that you get from ah the personal interaction with the pro- so that you can't get through a black box 

194.63 195.74 B: [laughter] 

201.91 203.12 B: right 

204.98 207.99 B: yeah yeah i think so too like i don't know 

208.26 214.90 B: it se- seems kinda sketchy to me how you would just be able to go through and get a degree online somehow 

215.32 216.51 B: (( i don't know )) 

216.63 222.26 A: i mean i can understand to a point you know taking like remedial courses online um 

222.41 227.82 A: but a a full blown education online is just a little hokey 

227.49 235.74 B: yeah yeah i could see that like just learning the basics and then but you would still have to prove yourself or something like later on 

235.86 241.59 B: i don't know how you can just go all the way through i mean someone could do it for you even it would be 

241.99 245.99 B: out of control you could look things up on the internet while you're taking your test 

245.92 247.63 A: yeah 

247.71 249.56 A: and another thing is you know 

249.83 262.50 A: ah let's say you do get your ah degree from an online source then you go to the job force to try and get a job and how well is that respected i i doubt i doubt it would be pretty highly respected 

258.16 259.70 B: yeah that's true 

261.62 267.34 B: yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't wanna hire someone that's just i mean if you looking at someone who went to a 

267.39 275.25 B: you know institution that you actually attend instead of just sitting at home on a computer you're much more likely to choose them 

275.52 276.17 A: (( yeah )) 

276.44 280.96 A: i don't you know with the crappy economy you wanna keep ah you know 

281.28 286.26 A: you wanna make yourself as marketable as possible for a job at this point 

284.48 290.36 B: [sigh] yeah yeah i agree i agree that that doesn't seem like it would do it for me 

291.62 296.55 B: so [sigh] well what else do we know about computers in education 

296.70 299.01 A: (( ah let's see )) 

299.57 312.60 A: i um in my in my case you know when i was a freshman we all had to purchase laptops the same laptop and you know that was a three thousand plus dollar expense right there 

312.00 313.82 B: wow yeah 

313.32 314.52 A: so 

314.69 320.01 A: i mean yeah it's hopeful but it's not attainable by all i don't think 

319.48 328.47 B: right yeah yeah ours the way we did it you know we could i had my own but you know like my room mate could just use mine 

328.49 340.99 B: we could break it up like that we didn't have to have the same thing and that was good we each had our chance to use it and stuff like that but yeah i don't know like making people buy all the same computers that seems 

342.22 351.77 B: seems a little unnecessary i guess [sigh] 'cause you know they all do the same thing and like let's say you had a computer and then they made you buy a laptop anyway 

352.31 354.03 A: yeah 

353.00 354.42 B: like that's how that works 

354.46 356.45 A: (( yeah it it was mandatory )) 

354.54 356.04 B: that it seems 

356.65 361.46 B: yeah that seems that just doesn't seem right but 

360.27 361.99 A: [noise] yeah it's a little weird 

362.11 363.22 B: yeah 

362.95 367.46 A: what about ah computer ah how what about abusive privileges 

368.15 371.54 B: abus- like in in a school or just 

371.12 379.07 A: ah a school environment college it's a big deal right now with um all these the kids being busted with ah casare 

379.02 384.79 B: yeah yeah all those downloading sites and things like that that's sure um 

382.61 383.54 A: yeah 

385.04 393.56 B: see i i'm fairly lenient on that just because [laughter] i guess 'cause i'm in college and i i take part in a little bit of that 

393.70 394.89 B: but um 

395.23 405.37 B: yeah i mean they definitely get abused and people download movies and all that they get them before they're even out and stuff like that but you know i don't i don't think 

405.55 415.68 B: that the student is necessarily responsible and if he's breaking he or she is breaking copyright laws or something like that you know that's obviously 

415.95 424.81 B: that's off you can't just be doing that but i mean i don't see any problem with like file sharing and things like that i think they can ah help a lot too 

425.94 437.83 A: um as far as like like if if in the schools you have um you know high school or college if you have an internet set up you have to be running a server through that institution 

437.88 443.34 A: and ah one of the the things about that is abuse that could happen you know on 

443.28 456.57 A: i mean if something happens it's the it's the school's responsibility to take care of it in the first place right such as copyright infringement or or something like that or somebody looking at pornography but um 

448.24 449.39 B: right 

456.79 459.31 A: you know there's more expense there too 

459.27 460.58 B: right right 

460.83 463.14 A: maintenance and upkeep of a network 

461.23 461.88 B: yeah 

463.03 467.35 B: yeah it also slows down you know people that are trying to do 

467.72 470.80 B: something you know educational or whatever it is 

470.92 473.11 B: it slows down the whole server and everything 

470.99 471.79 A: yeah 

474.21 483.51 B: but i mean there has to be restrictions on that that you know all that can't fall into the students to decide whether it's right or not to be downloading certain things 

483.71 485.07 A: (( right )) 

486.83 487.59 B: so 

490.42 492.36 B: what else what else 

494.81 495.95 A: (( [noise] ah )) 

497.92 501.13 A: different areas ah that 

501.91 509.51 A: that ah well what about the difference a- let's go for high school what kind of difference classes would benefit from computer use in a in a classroom 

509.38 511.25 B: yeah yeah um 

512.17 513.36 B: see [noise] 

514.77 516.72 B: i think you can 

516.96 524.97 B: really learn a lot on computers with i- in areas of like math or science or you know more objective areas 

525.19 525.97 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

525.34 528.53 B: where you know you can be tested on 

529.00 532.55 B: you know specific questions you know something like english 

532.83 536.13 B: you know read just have to read the book you know [laughter] 

536.14 538.80 B: and interpret it how you will but 

538.89 546.33 B: you know i mean everything to an extent though can be formed in a manner where a computer would really help um 

546.37 551.70 B: you know you could do english grammar exercises and things like that so 

551.93 553.55 B: i mean i really think 

554.04 558.09 B: if the if it's you know available to all the students 

558.27 561.78 B: and they could all potentially 

562.01 570.31 B: you know gain the same knowledge from the computers and they all have access that it could be very helpful in pretty much all the subjects i guess 

570.69 573.96 B: but i don't know what subjects were you thinking about 

574.60 581.13 A: well ah at my high school for instance ah we had hands on computer use in 

581.45 590.47 A: ah chemistry physics math ah we had um design like an auto cab type of class where we used computers 

590.74 593.73 A: um and we always had 

592.37 594.01 B: nice high school [laughter] 

594.25 599.83 A: [laughter] we had access to them ah like in the library and what not if you're doing research you know and
