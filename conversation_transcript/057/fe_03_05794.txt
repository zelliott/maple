280.55 281.23 A: (( [laughter] )) 

283.80 289.98 A: yeah [laughter] i know i wonder if anybody else is that far off it 'cause you know they pick some people to do it long term 

290.40 291.69 B: oh yeah 

291.06 301.14 A: yeah i talked i talked to one guy he said he got paid already but i don't know you know i don't know definitely one guy i don't know if everyone gets paid or if that guy was you know working for them 

300.34 303.16 B: yeah this is my second one so far 

302.23 309.24 A: oh really this is my this is my third i missed one this should be my fourth yeah this is my third ah 

308.28 310.66 B: i think they only let you do three oh 

310.07 317.05 A: yeah i know but for some reason they called me four times i guess because i missed the third one so they called me another time 

312.98 314.15 B: okay 

316.66 321.01 B: ah that's that's ah that's forty bucks instead no you missed it ah 

319.34 324.56 A: huh yeah well i only got thirty 'cause ah i didn't get the third call it was on my answer machine 

325.33 327.89 B: [laughter] yeah you have that rule about talking 

325.78 329.88 A: yeah but yeah [laughter] the woman's just like press one 

330.02 341.48 A: and whatever and it's just press two or whatever so i never got that one so i guess they called me they gave me a break and gave me a third one again yeah so what do your parents think about this thing like did you tell them about it 

335.57 336.55 B: yeah 

338.41 339.82 B: this um 

340.64 352.50 B: it well my dad isn't home 'cause he's away but like you know how mom's always she's like make sure you're not talking in to any psychos like you don't exchange numbers with people

351.89 353.61 A: very true very true [mn] 

353.10 354.28 B: um 

354.37 364.27 B: what else she she gets worried she worries about everything i have this little scratch on my leg she like brought out like thirty different medicines in a first aid kit a 

362.79 366.96 A: yeah i know that's like my mom too when when when i told her about this ah 

366.98 378.27 A: this thing she was like wait a minute let me see if it's like you know i i don't trust this what what are you doing do you have to show them anything do you have to buy anything you know all the whole nine the whole nine yards 

369.61 371.07 B: scam right 

377.94 379.00 B: yeah 

378.23 391.85 A: but ah yeah she's definitely one of those cautious moms that you know if you if you hurt yourself like you said before if you hurt yourself or whatever you definitely don't [laughter] tell her right away or you don't show her right away 'cause you know she's going to be all over you trying [laughter] to put everything on you 

391.76 395.30 B: i know and i it gets ridiculous like 

392.54 394.35 A: yeah 

394.54 399.36 A: yeah yeah you kind of listen after a while though [laughter] 'cause you know [laughter] 

397.09 400.27 B: yeah but like not like 

400.51 409.37 B: you know like i hated it at the time but but like when i think back like it feels good that like someone loves me that much 'cause we're like 

407.86 416.02 A: yeah that much yeah i know that that they're willing to you know put down whatever they're doing you know to to look at you know whatever happened to you or listen to whatever happened to you 

415.93 418.63 B: yeah and then bring out the whole medicine cabinet 

416.39 419.43 A: nobody does that nobody will do that in college so [laughter] 

418.80 420.11 B: [laughter] 

419.66 430.54 A: not even oh are you living in the dorms yeah nobody your roommates not going to do that either unless you've got a really good roommate but ah they don't do that either most of the time 

421.49 422.64 B: yeah 

425.96 426.90 B: yeah 

428.88 432.81 B: no i i'd be a little scared if my roommate did that [laughter] 

431.83 434.61 A: you you you know him yet or 

433.53 438.81 B: um no but like it's some kid like oh my god 

438.80 443.09 A: yeah yeah well well ah are you going to call him 

438.94 439.84 B: (( you know )) 

442.51 448.16 B: um i i don't i was i i have no idea who he is they didn't even tell me 

447.49 453.64 A: oh they didn't tell you when when they tell you make sure you call them talk to them you know get get to know them a little bit before you 

450.54 451.58 B: yeah 

454.05 456.06 A: see them 

455.34 458.63 B: yeah definitely but like i'm kind of weird i have that in me 

456.26 462.60 A: yeah and and then you know organize you know who's going to bring what you know if you're sharing the room so you don't bring you know two 

462.80 470.66 A: you know of of an object you don't need you don't want extra stuff like you don't want three phones like i ended up with three phones 'cause he brought two one for me and one for him 

465.20 467.20 B: (( yeah like two t._v.s or something )) 

470.88 478.96 A: didn't really need it you know extra extra stuff you know you there's not much space for it in dorms so yeah yeah my par- my dad told me to do that so 

475.65 476.84 B: yeah 

479.36 486.55 B: so um and so that's going to be it ah is that like kind of like your new family right now just 'cause you're living with them 

486.03 486.87 A: (( [laughter] huh )) 

486.81 493.28 B: e- ooh ah like like do you consider them family since all the time you you spend with your roommate 

493.64 499.20 A: no i'm sorry i can't i can't hear you 'cause ah i got the going and ah i'm trying to close my ear 

498.89 501.82 B: i um yeah i'm saying like 

502.05 506.87 B: well like since since you're ah talking about family and stuff like um 

506.94 512.32 B: does he take on some of the things like ah do you have like a brother or something 

511.75 513.59 A: no i'm an only child how about you 

513.32 515.28 B: me me too [laughter] 

514.50 528.10 A: ah yeah so [laughter] so ah that's pretty cool then yeah ah i guess this this will help you out definitely 'cause nobody did this for me like it depends on like i said before it depends on your roommate 'cause if your roommate's cool my roommate's okay he moved out which is even better 

528.13 532.31 A: and i had the room to myself but but ah if he yeah he pretty much 

532.82 546.41 A: ah he'll take on like the brother kind of role i never had one so i guess that's what he would like be called you know like you guys would hang out you know go usually usually if your schedule's right you know you'll go to the dining hall theatre or whatever 

539.59 540.48 B: yeah 

546.40 549.61 A: you know if he'll go to the gym or whatever you'll go with him 

549.86 557.73 A: you know it's it's you know it's just a hang out with the bud but you know he's in your in you know your home just like your brother would be so that's kind of cool if if if your 

557.75 571.04 A: roommate's nice you know you could talk about your problems together you know like how his class sucks you know it it'll start off like that and ah if everything turns out well you guys should have a really close relationship i know a lot of friends who are moving in with their roommates now 

571.01 577.55 A: like in ah in off campus apartments like you know you don't have to do that but they decided to do that because they've gotten so close 

577.29 578.53 B: (( yeah that you )) 

577.74 580.92 A: so it's all it's all up to [laughter] it's luck luck of the draw 

580.80 583.79 B: i think a roommate is just like a brother because 

583.09 585.01 A: yeah 

583.84 587.19 B: because like you don't get to pick him someone else does 

586.45 591.15 A: [mn] [laughter] very true that that that's pretty funny yeah 

589.68 592.00 B: and you can like him or hate him 

591.57 599.89 A: yeah but you you got to live with them that's actually actually if you complain hard enough they'll ah they'll switch you which is not like a brother 

593.52 595.43 B: yeah exactly
