11.40 12.84 A: oh really 

12.89 18.25 A: they've they've tried to call me a number of times and each time i've been out of the ah calling area 

17.84 18.93 B: ah 

18.36 20.62 A: so they leave a lot of messages 

20.51 26.48 B: [laughter] yeah well at least it worked this time we're supposed 

23.93 27.20 A: so what are we sup- what are we supposed to talk about 

26.60 31.17 B: we're supposed to say talk about what the word family means to us 

31.97 33.97 A: family 

33.14 34.85 B: yeah 

34.33 37.88 A: hm i i guess i always picture a nuclear family 

38.28 42.07 A: you know a father a mother and extended and 

42.17 43.71 A: no divorces 

44.30 46.62 A: straight n- not a straight line either 

46.76 47.68 A: (( [laughter] )) 

47.50 57.38 B: [laughter] well that's that's much preferable not to have a straight line yes ah [laughter] that would flat line very quickly um 

52.50 54.80 A: (( [laughter] )) 

58.58 60.13 B: no i 

61.59 65.54 B: i i guess i come from a nuclear family but i 

65.81 79.52 B: think my kind of definition has warped over time because there's so many people that are in a chosen family of mine that it just kind of extends outward 

80.18 81.80 A: oh that's pretty cool 

80.45 88.63 B: it's kind of the people that are really close to you that you know that you can trust that are it's usually 

89.15 92.11 B: deeper than what you normally get with friendship 

92.16 93.63 A: mhm 

92.69 93.87 B: um 

94.29 98.79 B: there is um one guy that i call my little brother that 

99.03 102.84 B: ah my parents consider him their other son 

103.21 105.33 B: so it's it's kind of a 

107.45 111.36 B: it's somewhat more encompa- more encompassing term i guess 

107.69 109.20 A: that's really cool ah 

111.47 115.54 A: is that is that a religious thing that you follow through there or 

114.78 115.81 B: no 

115.75 116.73 A: not at all 

116.63 117.87 B: not at all 

117.80 119.09 A: (( okay can ))

150.73 151.82 B: (( oh that's okay )) 

153.00 159.70 B: oh i wonder what they're how they're going to analyze that particular segment of this call [laughter] 

158.11 161.05 A: [laughter] well well we'll see 

160.14 162.50 B: they're all recorded [laughter] 

162.05 163.03 A: (( yeah )) 

162.59 169.37 B: god ooh hey i wonder what the person who's asked to listen to them has to go sit through sometimes 

164.87 168.07 A: (( right )) 

169.46 173.84 A: [laughter] they're sitting and listening to it and they go hey wait a second he's ordered lunch 

173.84 176.02 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

176.27 179.86 A: all right so family [noise] 

176.43 184.52 B: oh well hi hi whoever it is that was listening to this ah [laughter] welcome to the family you know ah [laughter] 

182.77 190.87 A: yeah exactly i mean it's like whatever happens happens right and i mean that's i guess you i guess you consider life family i can say 

186.56 187.81 B: yeah 

191.76 195.71 B: oh perhaps not quite so en- all encompassing [laughter] 

193.61 194.45 A: (( huh )) 

196.91 198.90 B: but yeah it's um 

201.48 206.88 B: i guess it's just the ones that get that close to you that um 

208.68 213.93 B: kind of step across the border line the boundary from friend into family 

215.32 215.99 A: (( oh )) 

215.58 216.81 B: [sigh] 

218.21 223.26 B: but then you can also look at it that all of humanity is family 

224.79 231.09 A: yeah yeah you could if you the people believe that yeah i can definitely see how people can believe that 

230.75 234.51 B: well if it's all genetic if we're all genetically linked then 

236.31 242.03 B: where where does the boundary between family and not family start happen 

242.01 243.63 A: i guess ideals 

243.65 245.09 A: or ideas 

247.64 250.55 B: that's an interesting way of doing 

251.89 253.95 A: 'cause i know people who are adopted who 

254.06 263.19 A: to that kind of you know like a line where it's like you're not family by nature or by yeah biologically by nature but ah overall 

263.20 264.41 A: they are 

264.34 266.08 B: (( it yeah )) 

265.21 266.41 A: you know what i mean 

266.30 268.18 B: mhm 

266.84 270.21 A: but they don't feel any different from there parents or brothers or sisters 

270.22 275.04 A: but they're not genetically linked except for you know the way way that we all are 

274.98 276.69 B: yeah 

276.27 278.02 A: [mn] but they're considered family 

279.89 287.42 B: yeah i just won- ah wondering where the where you would set the boundary between what is bound- what is family and what is not 

288.13 292.80 B: (( family yeah )) 

288.75 290.85 A: that's for us to decide that's why we were given a 

292.33 294.22 A: [laughter] 

293.86 294.76 B: (( [sigh] )) 

295.74 299.75 B: oh well so many things for us to decide

342.49 344.32 B: yeah 

342.83 347.88 A: you know what i mean there's no one to say that one things right or not it's all what ah we choose
