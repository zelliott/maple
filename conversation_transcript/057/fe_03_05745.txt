2.13 3.67 B: my name is jeff 

6.18 7.78 A: (( hi i'm kenny )) 

7.75 9.56 B: (( hi kenny how you doing )) 

8.95 10.48 A: pretty good how are you 

10.53 12.41 B: good this is my 

11.46 13.51 A: i didn't hear the tone 

13.39 16.08 B: no i heard that little tone i think 

16.53 19.30 B: so what are we talking about computers in education 

18.76 20.81 A: [mn] yeah computers in education 

20.90 26.04 B: well what do you think i think it's a good thing i think it helps to with the education process 

25.97 36.93 A: well s- i i'm in tenth grade so i actually think it's a a great thing because [noise] we get to use [noise] the online capabilities to get uh a better understanding of what's going on around us 

36.89 38.41 B: [noise] absolutely i mean 

39.05 42.75 B: every project you use i mean do you use your computer 

42.81 46.30 A: i i use a computer at school and i use a computer at home 

46.44 47.59 B: (( so [mn] )) 

47.67 50.43 B: i mean when i was growing i mean i'm a little bit older than you i mean 

50.62 61.67 B: everything we did i mean was just about was i mean we had no computers i mean and i wish in my work environment we use i mean we use computers for everything i mean and and i think 

61.89 64.48 B: adults today if they had a chance to 

64.87 66.42 B: use computers 

65.50 66.50 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

66.90 69.10 B: um when they were in school i think uh 

70.49 73.54 B: there would be much more opportunities open to them 

75.11 81.37 A: yeah and uh like learning is so much easier now and like you have the ability like if you 

81.50 87.88 A: don't work good around other students like my friend he has cyber school through the computer 

86.89 89.33 B: right mhm 

89.06 92.04 A: so the computer really does a lot of things 

89.40 90.44 B: um 

90.48 97.29 B: oh sure the answer to any question's at your fingertips um in my job today with computers um 

97.83 102.98 B: one of the problems you have and you'll see when you're out in the work force is that 

102.99 117.64 B: you're unable to companies cut back on training off campus and stuff like that so now we're taking um a lot of our training via the computer taking classes online things like that so um you cut down on expense for um 

118.94 122.56 B: for travelling and things like that for training so i mean 

123.47 133.35 A: the only bad thing about like all the jobs going computerized is a lot of the older people don't know a lot of things about computers and they're going to be in trouble 

132.96 134.59 B: yeah um 

134.69 137.57 B: [noise] and for those people hopefully um 

138.00 141.01 B: you know i'm thirty years old and uh 

141.66 147.07 B: i've made the transition in the last five years to learn about computers and i work in the computer field now 

147.14 150.58 B: so i mean it's never too late i mean you just gotta just [noise] 

150.63 153.71 B: you got a computer you can learn about computers by just going online 

154.28 155.99 B: i mean it's not um 

156.44 158.37 B: it's not a difficult thing to do 

158.67 169.49 A: yeah i- i'm lucky that uh when i was younger i took my mom and i took uh computer college courses so i'm pretty well adept on computers 

169.16 176.54 B: [noise] right well i mean so it looks like we're both in agreement on that part whereas 

176.59 177.56 B: i mean 

178.51 191.22 B: computers will definitely enhance the way you learn and what you learn and it just makes it s- i mean it makes so much easier we had to go to not that there's nothing wrong with the library [laughter] but we had to go to a library to um 

191.59 199.60 B: to look things up um encyclopedias and we don't use those i mean you can go online and go into an encyclopedia things like that 

199.01 209.39 A: yeah i know my school library has all the all the books they have the books there but they have three computers they had of all the every page of the books on the computers 

209.40 210.55 B: right 

209.65 213.49 A: so we usually just use those computers we don't even get the books 

213.20 215.29 B: yeah so i mean 

216.09 221.64 B: i think the one bad thing about using computers i mean having them being a big part of education 

221.61 231.71 B: is the human contact um people are in front of a computer and they're not they don't know how to adjust with people in the outside world in the real world 

231.81 234.39 A: [noise] yeah they're hermits and stuff 

232.15 233.14 B: um 

233.72 239.57 B: you know they get out into the workforce they've never dealt with people they've dealt with computers and you'll see 

239.70 246.67 B: that a lot of computer people c- programmers things like that [noise] are not the most uh 

248.47 255.52 B: what's the word i'm trying to say they're not customer friendly people friendly they want to be left alone with their computer 

255.84 257.42 B: to do what they have to do 

258.30 264.78 B: so that's one more negative thing you have the older people like you were saying you have it it limits that um 

265.06 267.60 B: that contact the human contact 

268.72 270.85 B: what else do you think 

270.63 283.28 A: well i don't have very many negatives just you know that the point you brought up about the the contact that is a really good one because a lot of the people that i've met that have spent their whole lives on computers they're they're they keep to themselves and 

282.83 284.45 B: right 

283.41 285.17 A: they're not very friendly 

285.75 287.47 A: i mean they're friendly but they're 

286.01 286.86 B: uh i 

287.87 290.22 B: they just sometimes just don't know how to interact uh 

289.65 290.87 A: yeah 

290.27 292.56 B: (( they have a you know i mean )) 

292.38 298.09 A: if you talk to 'em on the computer then they're fine but if you- if you're talking to them face to face 

294.61 295.17 B: (( [mn] )) 

295.38 302.39 B: right if you get 'em aw- if you get 'em away from that computer they have a hard time interacting with you 

302.70 305.69 A: [sigh] so the computer could be a problem you know 

305.79 309.37 A: taking away interaction sko- skills and stuff like that 

305.86 307.05 B: (( [noise] oh yeah )) 

307.72 310.87 B: right um 

313.07 317.21 B: but i can i think we're both saying also we find that there's many more 

317.59 319.02 B: positives 

319.35 321.06 B: than there are negatives 

320.66 322.04 A: oh of course 

321.29 322.55 B: with i mean 

323.04 325.46 B: with using a computer for education uh 

327.27 329.94 B: so i mean uh you know i don't what else we could uh 

330.70 331.71 B: it's just 

332.19 334.65 B: i mean it's the point about going online uh 

335.20 338.44 B: i mean that could be abused too i mean a- a- you know 

339.66 342.05 A: yeah it we th- 

341.24 345.46 B: i don't know if you see that if you know you have to because they're available but they 

345.78 357.83 B: i don't know i guess you can restrict them to what sites people go to things like that but for the most part like we're saying computers for education uh i mean it's a great thing it's a definite it's an asset too [noise] 

356.54 366.61 A: as long as you keep the the computers like restricted to certain things because yeah we had a problem uh a while ago where people weren't using it for the right things 

366.47 370.04 B: right i would like to see a study on 

370.34 375.08 B: maybe a school that is not using computers in education 

375.21 382.96 B: and a school that is using maybe the same maybe tenth grade students or something like that and over a year's time see how 

383.05 385.31 B: the grades were for those students 

385.55 387.08 B: yeah how they differ 

387.75 389.25 B: things like that [noise] 

388.79 398.98 A: [mn] you could probably see that the school that uses the computers have better grades and more like higher higher standards because of they have more information at their hands 

398.50 407.80 B: right but just the education thing and not the people part of it i mean having a computer is definite asset for anyone [noise] who uses it for education 

408.75 412.97 B: wh- i mean everything you can do like i said from online training [noise] to 

413.08 420.90 B: looking up information i mean a- any questions someone asks you it the answer's out there now if you just go online you'll find the answer 

421.48 434.08 A: another another bad thing about the internet is it is turning people like into like lazy people i've noticed they instead of going to college they have college online so 

433.25 435.01 B: oh sure yeah 

434.31 443.75 A: instead of going to like i._n._c. florida if you don't want to uh go to a car class you can take a car class online 

438.62 439.50 B: right 

443.55 444.83 B: right [laughter] 

444.64 448.19 A: it's just uh an easy way out sometimes 

446.71 448.75 B: yeah absolutely it's a 

449.26 452.28 B: educators and people have seen 

453.54 455.99 B: think ab- money is to be made on the internet 

456.23 456.79 A: (( [noise] )) 

456.66 461.81 B: and they offer so many things where you probably shouldn't do it online you should do it with other people 

462.21 463.19 B: you know 

463.21 471.52 B: but i mean i think taking college courses online is a great thing for tho- for those who work at a nine to five job and then after work you log on 

466.29 467.48 A: yeah that is 

472.41 485.55 B: to your computer and you know take some classes i i it's great but like i said for me i haven't been to a library in ten years five years you know because why i h- everything i need's on the computer 

485.22 489.41 A: [noise] and me every time i go to the library i just log on to a computer that's 

488.79 494.97 B: right so you m- are you going to see one day no books and that's a bad thing that's a bad thing about you know 

495.23 497.46 B: computers in education and you know 

499.44 500.59 B: um 

502.24 503.30 B: (( [noise] so )) 

504.32 507.39 A: [sigh] y- you'll have to excuse me i'm new at this 

507.04 509.82 B: yeah me too [laughter] this is my first one 

509.56 511.23 A: oh this is my second one 

510.79 511.68 B: is it 

511.48 512.31 A: yeah 

511.69 512.78 B: um 

513.78 515.31 B: (( [lipsmack] well you know )) 

515.69 521.97 B: we're both making good points the good thing about our discussion is we're in two different um age brackets 

521.61 524.43 A: yeah so we have two different viewpoints 

522.27 523.27 B: you know 

523.86 525.58 B: absolutely um 

526.46 530.54 B: i grew up where computers started taking off you're 

530.58 532.37 B: it's been a it's been 

532.51 536.57 B: well you know it's been growing since you've been yeah 

533.88 535.86 A: computers were already big when i was 

535.96 537.45 A: growing up 

537.82 538.80 B: so 

539.28 546.04 B: and i see negatives from a different way you see negatives and i see positives in a different way and a lot of the stuff we both agree on which are good things 

546.25 547.20 B: (( you know )) 

547.44 551.84 B: computers if used right by the right people are great tools 

552.03 553.02 B: i mean 

554.49 557.92 B: it makes your life lo- it makes your life easy um 

558.72 562.79 B: it makes your it simplifies a lot of things but you just have to 

563.61 565.33 B: know when to 

565.53 571.12 B: get off the computer for and you know and get into that i would never let my kids 

571.44 578.84 B: if they ever offered grade school or work like that or high school from home on the computer and not go 

579.08 582.83 B: to school i would not let my children do that because 

582.94 587.39 B: they need that people part of it but you can adapt the people 

585.19 588.97 A: well see they they do have that they have they have cyber school 

588.80 599.89 B: oh yeah i i think you know i think it's a good thing to complement classes you go home you take some stuff or you could take some classes but to totally have people doing that
