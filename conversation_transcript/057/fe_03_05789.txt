3.78 5.32 A: hi andrew what's going on 

5.52 8.74 B: [laughter] nothing much just ah trying to keep cool today 

8.32 11.55 A: yeah understood i'm doing about the same 

11.59 14.33 B: [laughter] where are you calling from [laughter] 

11.87 13.16 A: so i guess we're supposed 

13.44 16.91 A: ah i'm in brooklyn new york how about how about yourself 

14.93 15.99 B: got it 

16.56 18.05 B: i'm in chicago 

17.64 20.64 A: chicago wow what's what's new in chicago 

20.55 26.74 B: oh same old same old ah unemployed rate about the same the rest of the country [laughter] 

22.75 23.94 A: yeah 

25.56 38.24 A: yeah yeah it's pretty bleak here too [noise] but and and as much as i would ah would rather discuss that ah the the robot operator tells us that we're supposed [laughter] to ah discuss the meaning of the word family 

35.64 37.08 B: [laughter] 

38.51 41.96 B: [laughter] oh that's that's an interesting one i mean i've heard ah 

42.00 46.53 B: you know i've heard family usually coupled with family values a lot these days 

45.89 48.02 A: ah that's very true isn't it 

47.27 50.05 B: and ah it's it's it's something that ah 

50.29 60.07 B: i i personally believe family is it's it's not just a a a definition of you know someone that you're very close with but it's definitely it's 

60.18 67.28 B: it's almost a blood obligation and it's i'm seeing that it's you know kind of tossed by the wayside in in the crusade for 

67.32 70.25 B: you know family values and things like that 

69.58 77.63 A: yeah the strange thing about family values is that it's presupposed that there is like just one set of them as though adding the word family 

78.04 79.03 A: (( ah )) 

79.11 81.35 A: somehow makes the term [noise] more objective 

81.73 85.03 A: and i'm not sure that it i'm not sure that it does you know what i mean 

81.93 83.77 B: yeah i know i 

84.76 98.31 B: yeah i know i'm i'm seeing it very much used as as a it's it's a great emotional hot button issue i mean it's something that's right there at root level as soon as you you say the word family you know the first thing that comes to mind is is is children and of course you know think of the children 

98.18 100.09 A: [noise] well yeah that's true 

98.44 107.29 B: so i i i i'm seeing you know more often than not you know in in this day and age it's you know anything family related is is is used as as a tool for 

107.47 117.65 B: you know as as it's it's it's a you know basically a platform for fear to do some sort of change you know whether it's somebody actually believing in this particular goal or 

117.64 127.62 B: you know for ulterior motives but ah yeah no i'm i'm seeing you know a lot of a lot of dancing around what family should be and a sort of you know 

119.04 119.71 A: (( [noise] )) 

127.72 130.10 B: [laughter] traditional christian ah 

130.26 139.74 B: set of morals and values but ah you know that that's something that you know can w- just you know differ so greatly across cultural bounds and ah 

138.91 146.47 A: yeah yeah completely i mean yesterday ah it was interesting i was watching p._b._s. last night and they had this um 

146.54 157.01 A: special on about ah gay and lesbian parenting and it was kind of weird i have to admit in in some respects i felt that that the show 

156.96 170.08 A: w- maybe was helping define the limits of my liberalism because i did wind up thinking that it was kind of a problematic proposition you know like at least not without it's problems and um 

169.94 180.16 A: ah that was i mean that was just kind of like this gut response but then on the other s- res- ah on the other hand i thought i know so many completely fucked up families like you know ah 

178.22 179.06 B: (( [laughter] )) 

180.08 185.83 A: like destroy- like hetero parents having just screwed their kids up so tremendously that 

185.96 196.10 A: that maybe it's a little foolish for me to think that like being screwed up is going to correspond to like the the gender and you know ah sexual orientation of your parents 

196.01 209.38 B: well it's it's really it's it's it's kind of amusing that you bring that up because you know i see a lot of that same thing i've i've got a you know i i was originally you know raised in a very very liberal but very affluent you know very white town so 

209.22 215.93 B: everyone was very well to do and you know the people that i were exposed to were some [laughter] of the you know 

216.01 223.70 B: least morally solvent people that i've ever had to deal with and and at the same time you know i've i've got you know friends who you know 

223.42 224.23 A: (( [noise] )) 

223.50 238.23 B: you know male to fem- you know ah female to male transsexuals who got you know pregnant before you know they made the change and are now raising the child as you know where before they were a mom and now they're dad and it it's probably the most loving relationship i've ever seen because 

237.39 238.98 A: [noise] really 

238.39 242.84 B: this person you know has no qualms i mean they've they've seen 

242.85 247.59 B: what you know the worst society has to offer you know projecting on to them 

247.46 261.09 B: and because of that they're that much more sensitive as to you know w- what how how things are said and done and how they can affect somebody deeply even if you don't see an immediate you know visual emotional response you know how things can 

261.01 264.63 B: really get under your skin and ah you know that's 

264.75 271.19 B: it's it's it's once again you know comes back to the whole family thing you know it's it's it's so easy to plant that bug of fear 

271.20 276.67 A: yeah yeah completely and it doesn't it's interesting that you say that because that very sentiment was echoed 

276.70 279.28 A: in the t._v. show that i saw last night which 

279.29 287.37 A: i mean basically they were saying that that these people tend to be really compassionate and really more tuned to the feelings of others 

287.40 289.60 A: ah you know as as a result of 

290.34 291.69 A: as a result of 

292.00 295.32 A: partially as a result of the ridicule that they go through and partially 

295.45 307.70 A: because that they're they they see what their parents they see the struggle that their parents have so yeah that's it's it's interesting it's kind of strange i'd i do wonder how much acceptance it'll gain i think that when you live in a big city you can 

308.16 310.05 A: (( become )) 

310.13 314.97 A: less tuned to middle america you know you you kind of 

315.00 324.55 A: your view of things kind of gets skewed and you think that everyone's as liberal as you and then you know you'll have those shocking moments where you'll drive to like i don't know 

324.97 332.66 A: just like some truck stop outside of minneapolis or something and and and you'll realise like you know this is how the other half lives 

326.10 327.06 B: (( mm )) 

332.49 337.98 B: [laughter] well it's it's interesting because um i was i was born and raised in in in the bay area 

337.50 338.39 A: uh-huh 

337.91 347.82 B: and ah you know i was ah that that is the the cradle of you know i i i wouldn't call it real liberalism but more knee jerk liberalism unfortunately and ah 

345.99 347.33 A: right 

347.81 362.01 B: you know it's it's funny because i saw a lot of people that you know were crusading about you know well we're fighting against family values and we really know what a true family is yet especially in san francisco that has got to be the most family hostile town that i've ever lived in i mean you 

360.91 362.29 A: in what sense 

362.26 366.27 B: if if you had a baby if you were thinking about raising a child 

366.22 378.66 B: it was like oh my god what are you doing to yourself it it was almost impossible to find any stores that catered to you know you know any any sort of maternity clothes or you know very young baby clothes and um 

377.35 378.37 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

378.67 382.15 B: you know some some friends of mine they ah you know they 

382.10 388.47 B: they decided to have a child um right before they moved from san francisco to chicago they followed me out here a couple of years' later 

387.76 388.87 A: mhm 

388.27 397.29 B: and the difference was night and day for them um they came to the mid west and you know while chicago's still still a town you know it's still a pretty big city and it's got a lot of you know those liberal 

397.34 403.48 B: you know there there's there's a larger liberal core there they found a a much more accepting 

403.38 408.82 B: you know culture as far as raising a family goes um you know it's 

406.40 408.00 A: right 

408.57 409.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

408.60 422.63 B: ah it re- really was night and day you know people are much more friendlier if they go ahead and see a child whereas before it's like oh my god it's a squalling infant get it away from me which was the attitude that i you predominately see in a lot of ah lot of the west coast cities unfortunately 

421.50 426.76 A: yeah you know i read something interesting in the times maybe a couple of months' ago 

426.62 437.40 A: in the course of reviewing this book i can't rem- the the book discussed something called it was something like a catch phrase called like the cool mom syndrome or something but it was saying that that new york is ah 

433.56 434.71 B: (( [laughter] )) 

437.52 448.52 A: it's a really it's well you know the the the times when they talk about new york they're talking about manhattan you know they're like that's new york and as far as they're concerned and so in manhattan apparently because it's 

441.81 443.00 B: right 

448.75 454.17 A: you know such a style and m- m- m- money obsessed place 

454.49 458.84 A: there's this preoccupation among mothers with not seeming 

458.90 468.61 A: dowdy like they really just don't want to seem like you know the mom who doesn't have time to like dress well or whatever and so what winds up happening is they 

468.89 473.78 A: apparently this is like ah did like this is phenomenal what winds up happening is 

473.79 484.62 A: they're kind of in competition with their daughters because they're because their daughters you know have like this this leisure time and this youth that like the mothers really don't want to relinquish 

484.38 489.47 A: but that really you kind of have to relinquish in order to do a successful job of parenting 

489.49 497.45 A: and i was i was thinking you know i i was thinking a lot about this book because some of the most screwed up kids that i've ever encountered have been 

494.04 494.85 B: (( [noise] )) 

497.64 503.85 A: the products of like of like cool mom ah er like cool parent situations 

503.86 509.39 A: and i think that there's an interesting thing ah i mean have have you ever have you ever known a family where like 

509.40 514.53 A: a dad is is is like still obsessed with like being a youngster and like 

514.21 523.71 B: it's it's yeah and in in fact you know and [laughter] a a lot of you know there there were a lot of ah families that i was aware of where you know 

514.99 516.18 A: or a mom 

523.64 538.01 B: and this is this is ah terribly stereotypical but you know a lot of you know people still living in the six- sixties essentially and they never wanted to leave that behind and there was a certain amount of responsibility as far as you know they had to take to be a real good parent that 

538.00 544.80 B: they weren't just weren't going to take 'cause that meant they had to move on and so yeah i i see i saw a lot of that actually 

544.76 545.86 A: (( mhm )) 

544.94 548.16 B: and a lot of people you know taking a more ah a 

548.34 555.20 B: a a more you know brother sister role instead of the actual you know [laughter] mentor role that they should have as a parent 

554.12 559.66 A: yeah you know a a a friend of mine who's a parent said something interesting to me about um 

559.66 573.40 A: it about rules and he was saying that you might encounter a family where ostensibly there aren't any rules you know one of these kind of like hip dad situations whatever and in one of those families ostensibly there are no rules however 

573.55 576.63 A: this guy said to me there's always rules 

576.68 579.52 A: a- and not having them quote unquote is 

579.78 585.74 A: [mn] it's own form of rule making and the rule in that case is 

585.77 590.32 A: the rule to the children is you're not allowed to tell me to be responsible 

586.22 586.79 B: (( mm )) 

590.52 599.89 B: well i guess what it relates back to i guess what it comes back to is you know well it's it's it's not so much the rules as as their sense of of ah structure that 

591.18 594.04 A: th- that's that's the rule you know what i mean
