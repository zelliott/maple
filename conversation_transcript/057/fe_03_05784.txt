433.28 436.70 B: but it's nothing serious because ah of our

445.31 446.12 B: you know 

446.58 449.21 A: uh-huh but

457.12 459.10 B: oh yeah yeah i mean 

457.71 458.97 A: extremely 

459.15 461.69 B: you know it comes with the territory i mean 'cause

530.27 531.11 B: you know 

530.53 531.19 A: (( mm )) 

532.22 533.49 B: but ah you know

555.95 556.62 A: (( mhm )) 

560.82 570.26 B: and to have this girl as a serious relationship but at this time no i just want to concentrate on my 

570.55 574.12 B: business and concentrate on my kids and that's it 

574.68 579.64 B: once i have you know once i have free time then i'll be able to go out [mn] with her 

579.76 581.85 B: and vice versa with the same thing with her
