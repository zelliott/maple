0.00 1.54 B: hi this is doug 

1.30 3.41 A: hi how you doing i'm matt 

3.16 4.91 B: hey matt how's it going 

4.44 6.02 A: all right how are you doing 

5.68 7.42 B: good 

6.63 8.03 A: all right 

7.47 12.44 B: [noise] so the subject we're going to speak about is what is computers and and um 

8.04 8.79 A: well 

11.62 16.10 A: uh computers and education and do we think they help or hinder 

15.98 17.89 B: hah what do you think [noise] 

18.03 25.31 A: um as far as education goes uh i think they're they're nothing but beneficial they're they're a completely a tool 

25.44 27.54 A: as far as um 

27.75 36.77 A: uh i just think that uh the problem is th- that it can detract from you know a little bit of the human interaction like kids kids who are growing up on computers 

36.61 46.50 A: which is bas- there's there's no way two ways about it they're not going to be as socialized as as the same group of school kids on the other side of the world who never have computers 

46.35 47.55 B: mhm 

46.88 52.67 A: you know just because they're just not as accustomed to face to face interaction you know that's going to be taken away 

52.57 58.24 B: well are you talking about kids that are schooled o- through computers primarily and not 

56.87 60.94 A: yeah i'm thinking i'm thinking that they're they're talking about grade school 

60.77 62.04 B: mhm 

61.42 62.76 A: grade school kids 

62.84 70.87 B: but but in a given day i mean they're not spending all day on the computer there are other socializing kinds of activities 

70.65 77.25 A: right all all the same the same percentage of time that is spent in front of the computer 

77.85 88.56 A: is time that probably when you and i grew up we didn't have in front of the computer so it it's not like i think they're just going to all be a bunch of dorks 

88.50 93.75 A: it's just there's been a cut down on on the face to face time that they have 

94.05 98.42 B: hm interesting i i'm not so sure i'm not so sure about that i mean um 

94.27 96.67 A: so i just think that it 

98.39 110.75 B: when i was in school [sigh] we spent time interacting with the other kids but there was also a lot of times when it was kind of like you know open the book and be quiet and read the book and [sigh] and uh i don't really see a big difference between be quiet and open the book or 

110.74 113.87 B: and read the book or be quiet and read off of the monitor 

114.35 125.89 A: that's pretty much true i was thinking that they were us- they were considering uh computers as a supplement not as something that would take the place of books but something that would be in addition to the books 

126.02 134.57 B: well yeah i don't know i mean um i'm not uh obviously i'm not in grade school any more [sigh] and um i don't know h- i don't know exactly how they are [sigh] 

134.37 141.32 B: using them my my hunch is that computers are being used in the same way that 

141.18 151.01 B: you know in a very similar way that books are being used it's just that um the information is right there on a desk or right there for you to um 

151.48 153.78 B: have access to it's more 

154.14 160.16 A: [noise] yeah they're still definitely using books i've got nieces and nephews that do this and and [noise] um 

154.23 155.19 B: um 

160.22 173.37 A: they still use their school books [noise] it's just that there's extra time that you know the kids who who would need you know the kids who are are doing extra or who need to catch up or who are learning something [noise] um 

169.56 170.56 B: (( mhm )) 

174.54 186.52 A: learning something to get ahead or doing something that's sort of a supplement to their daily lesson it i think that's pretty much where most of the computer use comes in in terms of education [noise] 

185.83 191.56 B: mhm yeah i mean when when i was a kid we had encyclopedia britannica 

191.45 202.57 B: which was a book and they had you know um some somet- sometimes they had overlays and you know um plastic you know acetate things that let you see like how the body worked and stuff like that 

201.25 206.41 A: exactly and you saw the digestive system and the nervous system and whatnot yeah 

204.55 207.78 B: right but now they have encyclop- 

207.72 217.15 B: encyclopedia britannica on a c._d. rom and it's much more indepth because you can um you can like you can click up click on ar- 

217.02 225.33 B: archaeology and you can read about the nature of archaeology you can also click and see a video of somebody doing a dig in egypt 

225.31 227.35 A: right yeah yeah 

225.45 234.97 B: um and you can be taken through a guided tour and so there's just um a lot of multimedia that's accessible too and kids learn a lot through 

234.47 235.59 A: mhm 

234.97 244.68 B: moving pictures and um i i i get concerned that um kids reading skills will suffer 

245.09 256.13 B: um if you tell too much visually and kids aren't n- um required to read as much uh and use their own imagination which is what reading forces you to do 

256.15 264.65 B: um i think that people can get lazy with their reading skills and that kind of scares me because i think that reading is always going to be important [noise] 

264.95 271.65 A: [lipsmack] yeah right on um i er that that brings up another good point is that you have kids who um 

272.46 282.07 A: i mean i'm pretty much [noise] i i'm kind of a. d. d. and i'm that's just because i come on on the very cusp the very beginning of the m. t. v. generation 

281.65 282.76 B: uh-huh 

282.30 292.12 A: and you know there's so many distracting things that were so stimulating that that it that's the way it had to be that was there there yeah that there was their m._o. to keep our attention 

291.96 306.50 A: and i think it's going be that same thing y- you bring up a good point there is that you know these kids who are going to be stimulated by the quicktime or the you know the mpeg videos or whatnot they're never going to learn to fix their faces on words and you know 

300.40 301.53 B: right 

302.00 302.87 B: right 

306.86 310.01 A: [lipsmack] absorb them you know read them and stuff 

308.21 309.93 B: right right 

309.97 313.20 B: yeah i mean i would have to see um 

313.02 315.98 B: you know how computers are 

315.81 328.95 B: used how they really are used in schools to make a really educated comment on this but my hunch is is that a lot of it is relying on multimedia and uh a- and that's very passive 

325.74 327.45 A: yeah definitely 

328.71 331.26 B: it's passive like television is passive 

328.88 330.12 A: mhm 

331.41 334.21 A: yeah yep 

333.28 334.66 B: do you have any kids 

335.16 339.51 A: no just uh some young nieces and nephews who 

340.05 344.05 A: i try to visit as often as possible are you in ph- are you in philly 

341.62 343.13 B: right same here 

344.10 349.68 B: no i'm in new york city but yeah but my family is in south jersey 

345.54 346.59 A: oh you are 

350.28 351.44 A: oh right on 

351.31 361.21 B: so um you know i have um a niece and nephew in uh south jersey and so yeah we don't have any kids yet and 

361.24 363.26 B: um i'm also um 

363.96 376.20 B: curious er i mean i see my niece and my nephew they're so addicted to television and um although i have to say though that my niece is also very addicted to reading she's always got her nose in a book 

376.65 378.24 B: (( [noise] so that's good )) 

377.85 388.07 A: that's pretty cool [noise] maybe it'll be like a thing that'll turn out you know where it's like the kids who are most addicted to the the multimedia type learning also learn 

378.96 379.77 B: yeah 

388.09 398.51 A: also just happen to be the types who read books so it's just to be something to go hand in hand with one another and not something that poses a danger like we were talking about the possiblity of 

390.85 392.01 B: right 

393.75 395.14 B: right 

398.31 403.92 B: right right i also think that the internet is um 

404.00 410.17 B: uh h- opens up a whole world of opportunity for 

410.14 411.90 B: um education 

411.88 425.75 B: um you know obviously there's a lot of dark side to it too i mean it ac- you know it m- it it allows children to become um connected to strangers in a way that can be you know not healthy and even dangerous 

425.79 426.83 B: but 

426.24 427.22 A: (( true [noise] )) 

426.88 431.85 B: as just speaking for myself the way the internet has educated me i mean it's 

431.82 437.77 B: it's pretty thrilling to to see that now if i ever don't know what a word means or 

437.55 451.18 B: i can just go to dictionary dot com and find out immediately and a- and uh i guess if i kept a dictionary round i'd find that out too so it's not a great example but um m- more complex examples 

441.36 442.77 A: yeah 

445.88 446.89 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

450.54 451.10 A: (( [noise] )) 

451.08 452.79 B: would be um 

452.71 454.24 B: you know uh 

454.09 468.15 B: going on trips and wondering well what's half way from uh driving back to manhattan from uh quebec you know where could we stop on the way and just with two clicks i've got a map of vermont and quebec and i can see 

468.13 481.62 A: oh yeah yeah and if kids if kids are able to harness that sort of resource and understand it like you don't have an excuse for not knowing anything anymore if you don't know how to use c._a._d. software 

469.18 470.81 B: you know so so 

478.70 479.92 B: (( right well )) 

481.53 486.71 A: you know you can learn how to use c._a._d. software online there's some tutorials 

485.02 487.02 B: what is c._a._d. software 

486.75 496.30 A: uh it's just like one of the [noise] one of the three d. imaging uh software packages or systems used for architects and draftsmen 

494.77 495.90 B: (( oh okay )) 

496.15 496.92 B: okay 

496.34 508.58 A: so like there's nothing that you can't find out you know you can't find out what a type of cloud is you know what i mean it's just and if kids are taught that it's like yeah i know they can look it up and find out their essays and their 

498.90 499.67 B: huh 

501.45 502.94 B: that's right 

508.45 523.29 A: you know it's like an epidemic problem at the college level where they can't they they you know the teachers can't find out who's copying their stuff from a website and who's not at the same time it's like the kids that copy use it as a resource to find out what they're curious about and what they don't know 

512.34 513.53 B: copying them 

515.62 516.18 B: (( [mn] )) 

517.81 519.60 B: right 

523.20 525.94 A: that's just as powerful a tool as anything 

525.31 529.36 B: that's right and and as far as cheating in college i mean 

529.39 533.47 B: or cheating in high school i mean hopefully that kind of um 

533.58 541.26 B: that's really a character issue that's really someone being having their values sculpted where they see that they're only spiting themselves 

540.68 545.57 A: [noise] [noise] right but see that you know what i i i agree with you but i kind of disagree because 

545.42 560.27 A: you have the gray area of you you introduce a gray area that wasn't previously there where it's easier to be a little more amoral like i'll tell you the truth i use kazaa and i download music and stuff i also er 

558.81 560.75 B: i'm downloading as speak 

560.71 562.13 A: and it's like 

561.68 564.76 B: [laughter] i'm stealing from artists right now 

562.20 564.32 A: it it is it's like 

564.49 576.16 A: yeah i love it and it's like howard stern points out like it's great i use it but here's the music and i don't have a receipt for it it's essentially in a way it is stealing 

575.54 576.67 B: yeah 

576.06 587.17 A: but it's like it doesn't subvert the amount uh that i pay for music anyway 'cause i end up going out and buying the album eventually anyway but the fact is is that it it's easy to cheat it makes it so 

586.95 593.14 A: easy to cheat and i think that that is the same way with the college level students you know it's such a gray area [noise] 

587.79 588.70 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

592.58 599.89 B: well that's a good that's a good point that's a good point i mean it has this is i i always used to consider myself to be somebody
