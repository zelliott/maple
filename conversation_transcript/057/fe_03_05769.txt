1.04 2.52 A: hello i'm brian 

2.30 3.80 B: i'm ronnie 

4.30 5.65 A: how you doing 

5.08 6.94 B: good 

6.38 8.04 A: so the topic is family huh 

7.76 9.11 B: i guess so 

9.32 16.03 A: well ah family to me i guess ah first and foremost provides a support structure i feel 

16.41 27.01 A: ah pretty much for anything you do um the bigger the family the more support you have or to hope for the more support you have um that the relationship is ah is positive anyway 

28.18 31.54 B: yeah yeah i'm i pretty much concur with that i i'm 

31.55 40.89 B: the thing i have noticed about family is that ah i come from a big family and um you know when you grow up you kind of think all families are like that so when you have a 

41.44 53.55 B: have a um any kind of function you got ah i mean i always had about thirty cousins and stuff running around and then i meet other people and go to their functions and a lot of them don't even really know their cousins or 

47.06 48.13 A: mhm 

53.56 56.06 B: um and they've only got four or five 

55.73 57.52 A: mhm 

56.48 59.01 B: so i i guess i imagine um 

59.73 64.04 B: [mn] i would consider my family one of the closer families of the ones that i've been exposed 

62.22 63.52 A: mhm [mn] 

63.89 69.30 A: yeah i agree i grew up in a in a fairly close family as well kind of spread out across the map now 

68.68 70.14 B: (( to mhm )) 

69.45 70.67 A: but um 

71.08 75.11 A: we're still close and i i value that you know incredibly i'm 

75.19 89.70 A: pretty close geographically to my immediate family um which is important i know for my sisters and myself when we decided where we're going to where we're going to live and started professional careers we definitely um you know based part of the decision on ah where our family was and it was probably 

89.78 93.61 A: a good chunk of ah you know our decision was based on that 

93.39 93.95 B: (( [mn] )) 

94.13 99.12 A: so i think it's important um i have a very big family like i mentioned um i'm 

99.79 101.44 A: close with them 

101.67 109.12 A: i don't really see them that much um but when we get together for you know reunions or weddings or things like that you know we always ah we 

109.35 111.29 A: still have a good time and everything so 

112.89 120.19 A: [mn] you know clearly it's still um like a major thing in my life you know i speak to the people and ah my relatives on a regular basis or not 

121.17 127.96 B: yeah i actually oddly enough ah my immediate family is with the exception of is 

127.99 131.22 B: kind of whittled down now to my mother and my brother 

131.13 132.25 A: mhm 

131.62 135.21 B: ah my brother lives ah i live in new york he lives in phoenix 

135.55 146.12 B: so we're kind of separated but it ah strangely enough it i wasn't as close to my brothers as i am with some of my cousins that i um 

146.83 149.48 B: who that i grew up with ah 

149.77 163.77 B: my ah my mother and father separated for a while when i was younger so i kind of went with them my brother's were already at they left ah they left the house kind of early so i wasn't as close with them as um [mn] 

153.36 154.57 A: mhm 

158.32 160.09 A: mhm 

164.39 168.21 B: like i say i um a couple of my cousins and 

167.30 169.76 A: are you far apart in age from your brother 

169.63 170.59 B: um 

170.64 175.51 B: from yeah i my eldest brother died um when i was 

174.37 176.23 A: (( sorry to hear that )) 

175.69 184.79 B: i was about ah five y- we were about five years apart and my other brother about two and a half years so yeah pretty close yeah age wise 

181.35 182.18 A: uh-huh 

185.47 187.26 B: (( but )) 

187.89 188.81 B: (( [mn] um )) 

188.82 190.52 B: just kind of um 

190.75 193.07 B: very far apart like they were both 

193.77 197.42 B: um they kind of got into the hippie culture type thing and i was 

197.52 200.82 B: ah i grew up more of kind of a sports nut 

200.63 201.56 A: uh-huh 

201.65 204.75 B: and ah so we just didn't have that in common 

205.56 206.13 B: (( um )) 

206.19 212.68 B: [mn] and plus i think in a in a three way situation kind of the middle brother tends to gravitate toward the older brother 

211.87 212.76 A: uh-huh 

212.94 217.33 B: so there was there was that kinda i mean i get along fine with my brother but there's no 

217.82 222.92 B: there's no ah dissent or animosity just as far as the closeness goes i 

219.94 221.23 A: right 

223.06 228.24 B: i got some other members that are in my family that i consider closer 

227.97 229.27 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

228.76 235.04 B: ah with the exception of my mother i'm very close with my mother and she lives in rhode island so that's 

235.30 240.76 A: so what do all your ah do all your most of your cousins come from ah one particular side of your family 

240.36 241.50 B: um 

241.61 243.04 A: or is it a mixture of the two 

242.07 249.91 B: yeah yeah well you know my mother had nine brothers and sisters so i guess most of my cousins come from there but 

250.08 256.11 B: my f- on my father's side ah one of his sisters i'm very close to 

256.49 261.39 B: ah her daughter and her son and her other daughter 

261.44 264.06 B: and we're actually quite close mm 

263.38 264.73 A: mhm 

265.68 276.80 A: [mn] yeah my um my mother's family is quite a bit larger than my father's family um starting with their siblings and then through the next generation their children all of my cousins and ah 

269.92 271.82 B: (( mhm )) 

277.34 282.26 A: it's interesting 'cause i just recently got married within the last year and i 

282.54 288.37 A: am definitely much closer with my mother and her side of the family than i am with my father's side of the family 

287.98 289.80 B: (( oh yeah )) 

288.79 299.29 A: and i think the exact opposite's going to happen um you know when my wife and i start building our family 'cause i'm still very tight with you know my family so i think our children will see 

297.28 298.23 B: uh-huh 

299.67 304.81 A: my side of the family as being the bigger family and the tighter knit family versus my wife's which will be 

305.15 309.55 A: ah interesting i guess it's just um you know a matter of what you come from 

309.58 311.09 B: (( yeah i i )) 

311.32 315.82 B: i you know i um actually my mother's family is really the the closer 

316.14 326.91 B: knit family there there's so many of them but they've stayed in touch all these years and they they regularly see each other you know they they play cards and everything ah my father's family i guess 

324.11 325.31 A: mhm 

326.93 338.12 B: ah his brother didn't have any kids and he lives out in florida so he's probably the least connected and his sisters one of them i um 

333.18 334.96 A: mhm 

338.30 346.30 B: you know i i as i was going through high school i spent a lot of time over their house and she's the one that i'm close to the daughter and the son 

346.58 347.41 A: mhm 

346.79 347.68 B: um 

348.04 360.89 B: and ah so you know there there isn't that i i mean she's actually very close to my mother's side of the family also they they really like her a lot and she she's always invited to whatever functions there are and 

359.80 360.79 A: uh-huh 

362.16 365.28 A: yeah that's interesting actually my wife's family her 

365.32 373.09 A: mother and her family and her father and his family whenever they have um like holidays and get togethers they always combine 

373.16 375.59 A: 'cause they're such a small family on both sides 

373.37 374.50 B: (( yeah )) 

375.11 376.00 B: (( uh-huh ah )) 

375.60 377.24 A: they bring 'em together and i you're 

377.37 383.74 A: kind of looking at it and almost i guess i don't know what normal is but you know it's a little closer to my to the sides of my family 

383.97 393.69 A: and um but my family don't like my mother's side and the father's side don't really ah like they're friendly but you know we don't get together on holidays or anything like that at the same time 

394.22 395.79 A: [mn] but um 

397.24 400.95 A: (( [mn] i don't know i guess we're supposed to talk about what family means to us [laughter] )) 

400.15 406.63 B: yeah i yeah in a i don't i don't necessarily i i think sometimes it's not even um 

406.64 415.87 B: a product of the make up of the the individuals involved it's it's you know it could be a a product of the or it's a combination i guess of the make up of the individuals and the circumstances 

415.33 416.64 A: mhm 

415.97 427.39 B: so i guess some families are just ah the individuals are just not inclined to be that close or they don't get along or they're just s- separated so much geographically that they don't um 

422.63 423.50 A: mhm 

427.65 430.06 B: they don't get together that much you know 

430.57 432.67 B: (( i i i don't know what the um )) 

433.22 433.80 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

433.82 436.97 B: who what the demographics would be on something like that 

436.37 437.44 A: (( right mhm mm )) 

437.39 441.54 B: i i um i've just always been amazed that ah 

441.85 445.79 B: whenever i go back to i i had a cousin who um 

446.12 451.65 B: promised her told her grandmother that she would do her best to keep the family close 

451.86 463.32 B: and she threw a party every fourth of july so that it when when i i moved to new york to to act and play music and yeah and it it was a 

460.50 461.55 A: no kidding 

463.34 467.49 B: it was a great thing for me because i got to go back and see everybody all at one shot [laughter] 

467.09 468.10 A: uh-huh 

467.94 468.98 B: (( and um )) 

469.19 471.90 B: she ah she just died over the past year 

471.73 473.02 A: i'm sorry 

471.98 475.40 B: (( i don't know what what's what that's going to do um )) 

476.98 478.56 B: (( in the years to come )) 

478.87 482.44 A: well you gotta pick up the ball and roll with it i guess [laughter] 

481.75 485.94 B: yeah i you know something there's been rumblings about you know 

486.25 494.44 B: you know that somebody else should take over and and do that but right now we're just um i'm letting my aunt kinda get over that we might 

493.47 494.42 A: uh-huh 

496.02 498.15 B: pursue that 

497.14 505.29 A: [sigh] yeah i i guess the world is getting smaller and smaller now with ah you know with the advent of technology and everything so it's a little bit easier to to keep in touch with people 

505.31 511.68 B: it definitely with with email um and being able to send photos and things like that ah 

507.15 508.50 A: mhm

511.76 514.75 B: definitely that's a great thing to help people keep in touch 

514.59 516.07 A: definitely 

516.58 519.89 B: mm i c- i can't wait 'til they perfect the 

519.92 520.85 B: um 

520.86 527.95 B: you know voice tech- voice over technology on i._p. and then people can just talk and not have to pay an arm and a leg
