0.14 1.71 A: alex [noise] 

1.02 4.48 B: hey my name's edward how's it going alex 

4.41 5.63 A: i'm good [noise] 

5.48 6.46 B: where're you at 

6.64 8.47 A: um [noise] new york 

8.02 15.95 B: new york wow i think the last person i talked to was from new york too i'm over in ah oregon the other side of the coast so what think about ah computers in education 

12.97 13.89 A: oh wow 

15.97 16.60 B: (( [noise] )) 

16.66 30.39 A: um well they could help you because they have a lot of resources that um maybe would be easier for kids to look up than going through books 'cause a lot of kids don't like going through books you just like going through computers and stuff [noise] [noise] 

25.33 26.14 B: right 

27.35 29.10 B: yeah yeah 

29.67 33.21 B: well maybe it makes it too easy for them you know 

33.49 38.73 A: that's true but in a sense it's like it doesn't matter how easy it is as long as they learn it you know 

38.67 39.81 B: yeah 

39.15 40.49 A: that's most important 

40.47 44.74 B: it's kinda like like kids with calculators they don't really learn 

44.91 51.50 B: the math and the calculators these days are little computers and they can basically do anything if you take like algebra and geometry or whatever a 

51.64 64.42 B: lot of them have all that stuff built in i don't know it it's i think it makes kids easier for to easier for kids to slide by kinda plus there's so much cheating on the internet too you know you can buy papers 

57.55 59.16 A: yeah that's true but 

60.20 61.88 A: (( yeah what )) 

64.82 69.95 A: oh yeah that's true but they have like things now that could catch people who use papers from the internet 

69.61 71.65 B: right right yeah true 

70.38 75.04 A: and i know m- m- my my college had that i don't know what it was but something 

75.25 79.21 A: that um they could tell if it's on the internet or not 

78.66 79.50 B: uh-huh 

79.37 80.22 A: so 

80.39 81.16 B: huh 

81.86 86.46 B: i don't know i don't think anybody's ever been caught at my college doing it i've heard all the teachers say it though 

81.96 82.99 A: but 

86.94 88.10 A: yeah 

86.94 91.76 B: they talk about papers they've gotten that've been you know off the internet and stuff 

91.74 93.51 A: (( yeah )) 

92.35 96.01 B: if they've gotten more than one year in a row and shit like that so 

96.13 105.82 A: yeah but it's a double edge sword it's like you have good points and bad points it's like it's easier to find stuff you just put it in type in the word and hope that something's coming out 

105.45 107.02 B: yeah true true 

106.95 114.58 A: yeah and then you get some more stuff more information on the internet than you can from actually just one book maybe it just has like a short section on it 

114.91 116.54 B: right 

116.30 118.25 A: so i don't know well it 

117.18 119.68 B: i guess it kinda depends on the person too 

119.71 120.87 A: yeah 

120.27 121.93 B: you know the student 'cause i mean 

121.91 127.92 B: i know some of the stuff i do it makes it makes it kinda easier for me to to slide by with 

127.70 132.09 B: you know right when i'm i can just sit down i don't have to like plan anything or 

131.89 143.75 B: go to the library and actually you know pull out books and it's like on the internet i can just type up stuff and it's right there and then i can look at it and kinda re-paraphrase it and start start writing my paper right there i don't know 

143.75 149.29 B: if it's maybe it's good for me as if i didn't if i had to go and you know read 

149.88 158.30 B: 'cause li- it stuff on the internet too is a lot shorter you can find you know little bits of information that are real like general which is what you need to write a paper you know but 

158.02 158.99 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

158.45 170.23 B: when you go to the library there's whole books about the stuff and it like goes on and on for ever so you have to kinda read more and figure out what you wanna you know you have to look harder and when you look harder i think you you're forced to read more 

170.25 171.28 A: yeah [noise] 

170.52 175.96 B: so maybe in that way it's probably better for you like you said i guess it's a double edged sword i don't 

175.89 181.51 A: yeah but i think like for educational purposes [noise] for little kids it's like they haven't like new 

181.58 190.71 A: i guess new c._d. roms for kids that that makes them enjoy it to you can make it easier to learn on the computer and make them more enjoyable with the i guess with the animations or whatever 

190.36 191.78 B: know yeah true 

191.73 192.82 A: yeah 

192.27 197.59 B: true and you can click anywhere and go and like zoom in on any little part of whatever you wanna 

197.54 198.57 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

197.92 199.55 B: find out about 

198.95 199.65 A: (( [noise] )) 

200.09 201.01 B: i think it's 

201.14 206.21 B: it's easier too with the internet just in general to like go find information on stuff that interests you 

206.50 216.81 A: yeah i mean it's up to you if um how you're gonna use it you know if you just use it to get by and cheat that's up to you but you won't get the full you know the full credit for it you know 

207.40 208.68 B: you know maybe 

213.27 214.08 B: (( huh )) 

214.25 215.56 B: right 

216.58 218.42 B: right so i guess those 

217.28 219.39 A: (( and if you really wanna learn it you know )) 

218.72 223.23 B: yeah those kinda of students are probably gonna try and do that regardless so i guess it really doesn't 

223.35 225.94 B: doesn't re- more depends on the person 

225.90 227.37 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

226.86 230.14 B: yeah so it probably is maybe it is overall a 

230.30 231.72 B: better thing 'cause you 

231.79 233.49 B: have such reach 

233.55 237.19 A: yeah yeah 'cause i know i use it a lot when i was in college for papers you know 

233.58 234.92 B: (( information wise )) 

236.92 239.57 B: (( yeah i totally do it )) 

237.99 241.20 A: (( yeah i got it in i didn't copy word for word but you know [noise] )) 

240.75 241.50 B: (( mm )) 

241.95 243.44 B: did you get a degree 

243.34 244.69 A: oh yeah 

244.14 246.46 B: (( what deg- ah did you do you get a degree in )) 

246.38 248.22 A: um computers and business 

247.87 250.14 B: (( [laughter] computers and business )) 

250.13 251.59 A: yeah [noise] 

250.96 251.69 B: (( great )) 

252.13 253.12 A: (( how about you )) 

253.45 259.18 B: i'm still in school but i use computers all the time i mean my degree is it's graphic design so 

254.78 255.77 A: (( right [noise] )) 

259.20 260.81 B: it's like continuous 

260.82 261.96 A: oh yeah 

260.86 267.52 B: con use pretty much yeah so i use it for [sigh] everything from you know finding images and stuff like that to 

268.08 273.24 B: technique to you know it's not just the internet too you know all the programs for graphic design 

273.25 276.92 B: photoshop illustrator and all that but it's 

273.37 274.15 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

275.69 278.81 A: (( [noise] an and it's also cheaper because )) 

278.84 282.91 A: you know you go and buy all those books and then you get to work online for free you know 

283.33 284.86 A: (( [noise] that's )) 

283.35 288.39 B: right yeah yeah true they still make me buy books though a lot of classes 

288.76 289.50 A: yeah 

288.84 292.77 B: and and they're so expensive like seventy bucks for a text book fifty bucks 

292.65 293.81 A: (( yeah i know )) 

293.90 299.69 A: [noise] i remember when i was in school like i bought the text books then i hardly read it like all of it text books 

294.01 294.87 B: (( there you go )) 

299.46 300.52 B: (( mhm )) 

299.84 302.22 A: but like the main points and stuff [noise] 

301.93 303.64 B: yeah yeah 

303.02 309.01 A: yeah [noise] sometimes they all go to waste it's like damn i brought this book and i rarely go through it that much yeah [laughter] 

304.29 305.64 B: you slide by 

308.81 314.54 B: yeah and then you sell it back and you get like [laughter] twenty bucks for it for a seventy dollar text book 

313.18 313.85 A: (( [noise] )) 

314.30 315.82 A: (( yeah i know [noise] )) 

314.85 317.40 B: and used once hardly [laughter] 

317.87 322.71 B: yeah computers are pretty cool i don't know i guess when they connect you to the internet though 

322.75 331.39 B: a lot of people in my sc- in my school we have full time internet connection so a lot of people are screwing off and surfing the net while the teacher's not there 

331.42 333.22 A: oh yeah they do that at my school too 

332.34 334.19 B: [laughter] yeah 

333.45 335.30 A: i think that's everywhere you know 

334.66 343.56 B: yeah so it can be kind of a distraction i guess it's probably good for the students who are good students and it's probably bad for the students who don't 

343.33 345.06 A: (( yeah slack off yeah )) 

343.43 351.15 B: who you know are there just to screw off so they have like more opportunity to be distracted and whatnot mm 

352.16 358.75 A: but it is a great resource it's just how you use it you know like everybody's going have everything's going come more useful it just depends how you use it you know 

358.63 364.97 B: right it's like school in general it's a good resource if you're gonna [noise] actually try but if you're not then it's pretty much 

365.12 371.42 B: not worth a lot you might as well be [noise] spending your time learning a trade or something you know 

369.98 371.81 A: yeah yeah save money [laughter] 

371.58 377.80 B: yeah exactly than wasting other people's money like the tax papers the tax payers money 

378.18 379.42 B: sort of thing 

379.44 384.06 A: yeah [sigh] yeah so i mean i don't know what else to say about it [laughter] 

384.07 385.52 B: what's that 

384.91 387.02 A: i don't know what else to say about it i don't know 

386.50 388.19 B: yeah i know i mean that's pretty much 

388.24 389.89 B: (( about it it's not real )) 

389.22 391.74 A: (( um )) 

390.36 391.68 B: hard subject 

391.77 393.03 A: [laughter] 

392.49 393.77 B: (( [laughter] )) 

393.09 395.20 A: i know they cheat a lot that's all i know 

395.15 398.35 B: yeah yeah true 

397.40 398.99 A: (( mm )) 

398.80 402.77 B: true they make [noise] my job a lot easier though in my you know my education 

402.88 404.62 B: 'cause before ah 

405.44 413.22 B: before like i don't know just five ten years ago everything was done by hand now they do everything on the computer graphic design 

413.39 414.53 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

414.40 415.33 B: (( so it's makes )) 

414.56 420.59 A: when i use them for like reports i use like pictures ah from the internet like re- like good pictures that you know no one will find 

417.14 417.96 B: uh-huh 

420.71 421.96 B: (( oh really )) 

421.40 422.84 A: (( amazing yeah )) 

422.68 426.20 B: yeah for for what what you do in ah your job you mean 

426.79 430.93 A: oh no when i was doing when i was in doing reports and stuff i used pictures and stuff you know 

430.27 434.34 B: oh right right right yeah that is that's kinda cool too 

431.68 432.70 A: yeah 

434.47 441.59 B: it lets you lay out papers a lot faster and [noise] put pictures and formatting and all that stuff to make it look 

441.63 442.79 B: slicker 

442.92 450.12 A: yeah but it it just the internet in general like it has plenty of useful things on it but yes it has its' bad things too so 

443.72 444.28 B: (( [sigh] )) 

450.04 452.96 B: yeah true 

453.05 453.74 B: (( [noise] )) 

453.78 454.44 B: [sigh] 

454.26 459.04 A: it just depends what value you have i guess [noise] whether you use it for good or bad or you know [noise] 

459.34 463.50 B: yeah [noise] it just magnifies who you are 

459.49 460.37 A: (( whatever )) 

464.06 465.59 A: yeah 

464.21 465.64 B: as a person 

465.94 468.39 B: jesus is the ten minutes up yet 

465.94 466.50 A: (( [sigh] )) 

467.90 469.36 A: (( [laughter] no )) 

468.41 471.59 B: [laughter] i think we we've started discussing the whole thing again 

471.73 476.60 A: i know it's like they should have gone like a more broader subject you know [sigh] 

472.06 473.15 B: (( go over it yeah )) 

476.30 482.44 B: (( yeah i don't know how much there is to say about other than what we said )) 

481.73 483.02 A: yeah but 

483.45 491.46 A: i don't know it's gonna have a a big future i think i mean it could be like the future you just like they might little by little do away with books i i don't know probably books 

490.71 491.91 B: yeah that's 

492.44 494.83 B: i ah i think it's gotta happen 

492.70 493.54 A: but 

495.11 507.88 B: i don't it's hard to see how it would happen because books are so i don't know easier to read you know what i mean you can never sit down trying to read a book on the on a computer screen it's just not it doesn't hurt to hold a book 

501.46 502.26 A: yeah 

505.58 507.56 A: yeah 'cause it's 

507.82 509.56 A: yeah the glare and stuff 

509.50 515.28 B: yeah you can't you can't like lay down on a couch with it or anything lift it up or 

513.68 514.57 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

515.41 520.13 B: whatever they have the new tablet computers though that would be pretty cool i guess to have in school 

520.00 526.47 A: well actually like they they started taking like certification courses you could take over the computer too like you just read from it 

525.89 528.75 B: yeah yeah online schooling 

528.18 529.48 A: yeah 

528.84 537.02 B: yeah my school has that i'm not sure how good that is though man i can't see that comparing to a real college education where you know real 

530.52 531.34 A: yeah 

537.35 539.05 B: in class education 

539.14 545.35 A: yeah 'cause you need like guidance of like what things are about you just can't read it and be like all right i 

544.76 555.14 B: yeah yeah i mean you think that people in ah people in class are surfing the internet while the teacher's stand twenty feet away from them what kind of distractions are you gonna have when you're at home and you can 

555.36 556.34 A: yeah 

555.54 557.18 B: do anything you want 

557.24 559.54 A: yeah you could be like on chat [laughter] 

558.91 563.72 B: yeah [laughter] or even people are probably watching like ah oprah in the background and stuff 

563.40 564.70 A: yeah 

564.04 569.52 B: [laughter] yeah chatting i don't know and plus when the teacher's you can't i 

566.26 567.32 A: [laughter] [noise] 

570.13 576.42 B: don't think it's the same when you have to type and talk to the teacher and wait for them to do your your little instant message i mean you know 

576.52 577.60 A: yeah 

576.89 582.10 B: doesn't really compare to raising your hand in class and everybody listening to your question and whatever 

580.83 583.95 A: and giving their interp- interpretations of it you know 

583.53 586.44 B: (( yeah yeah just doesn't seem right too )) 

587.12 591.12 A: [sigh] yeah takes away the whole social you know interaction i 

587.40 588.48 B: (( much of a )) 

590.53 595.04 B: (( yeah yeah well it i don't know )) 

595.49 596.76 A: (( guess maybe some degrees it would )) 

596.42 599.95 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

599.36 599.89 A: (( be okay for ))
