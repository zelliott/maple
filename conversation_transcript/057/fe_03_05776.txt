4.94 5.90 A: (( hi dan )) 

7.34 12.38 A: good um no this is my first one so 

8.24 10.48 B: have you done any of these before 

11.68 13.95 B: yeah ah me too so 

13.73 14.87 A: [laughter] 

14.17 21.15 B: um okay i i don't know exactly i guess we're just supposed to talk about what the what the word family means to us 

20.62 23.79 A: family means to us you [mn] feel free to go first 

23.33 31.67 B: okay okay i don't know that's that's a tough one for me 'cause i've been having a lot of trouble with ah with family things recently so um 

23.94 25.51 A: [laughter] 

31.71 34.03 B: i don't know and i guess sort of ah 

34.16 41.85 B: i don't know i've been spending a lot of time with my girlfriend's family and sort of i i guess i've gained more of a definition through that so um 

42.24 53.31 B: let's see ah i don't know i guess it means like ah you know o- openness and and honesty and caring and you know those good general things um 

53.69 62.04 B: but ah yeah i guess i guess really like kind of a support sort of more of a support system that's kinda how i think about it 

61.91 66.05 A: if you've got a problem with family lately wouldn't [mn] does that help define it more 

66.66 68.01 B: (( it's um )) 

68.10 83.08 B: let's see i gu- well yeah it helps me define it like in terms of i guess what a yeah what a family should be maybe i'm thinking more of idealistically you know kinda like um seeing my girlfriend's family and how they interact is is sort of more of a meaning for family 

82.95 83.78 A: yeah 

83.23 92.25 B: than ah kind of what i've had um so yeah maybe i'm thinking like the term family idealistically and what it you know what it should mean and and that stuff 

92.52 93.57 B: so 

93.90 95.47 B: yeah i don't know 

94.56 100.75 A: [mn] i i mine's a similar 'cause i have a very small family and it's it's 

98.37 99.38 B: uh-huh 

101.37 102.69 A: (( what is it ah )) 

102.78 109.25 A: like three or four people is basically my entire family so mine kind of extends to 

109.67 115.70 A: my fiance's family or friends as well it's more of an all encompassing 

115.78 119.04 A: idea than just the people that i was born and raised with 

118.72 119.68 B: uh-huh 

119.45 123.59 A: so i guess it's kinda the same thing that you that that you just explained too 

123.63 127.53 B: yeah just what the idealistic or or kinda 

124.66 125.52 A: so 

127.60 130.06 B: or you mean the the term ah 

128.00 128.92 A: yeah 

129.93 134.89 A: well you said that your like your your girlfriend's family has become more of your family as well 

134.37 135.62 B: yeah 

135.08 138.55 A: so i guess that kind of parallels that because 

138.61 141.30 A: that expands my family by 

142.01 145.18 A: by attaching myself to my fiance's family as well 

144.49 146.66 B: uh-huh uh-huh do you 

145.41 148.09 A: so that creates a larger group of people 

147.80 151.43 B: oh okay are you close with your with your own family 

151.27 154.54 A: um some of them not as i live 

155.35 158.41 A: i live in chicago and they live in seattle so 

158.34 159.42 B: (( oh okay )) 

158.54 164.87 A: it's it's i don't see them all the time talk to 'em but not extremely close it's been 

163.57 165.29 B: yeah oh okay 

165.09 168.11 A: twelve years since i've been back there so 

167.82 171.73 B: oh my gosh wow so have they come to visit you 

168.97 170.28 A: (( yeah um )) 

172.12 181.73 A: well i've seen them over twelve years but it's been let's say i left for college and like i have a younger sister and my younger sister started to um 

181.83 184.34 A: she's four years younger than i am 

184.41 197.76 A: so when i left she was just starting to really you know she's hadn't even quite gotten into high school yet and was starting to figure out who she was so she was really developing as a person and i was already away from the house so i wasn't involved in that 

184.50 185.32 B: (( uh-huh right oh )) 

194.71 195.64 B: okay 

197.21 198.09 B: uh-huh 

198.03 199.03 A: so 

198.10 199.11 B: okay 

199.70 209.15 A: but it doesn't mean that she's still not my sister and i care about her and everything but it's just i wasn't involved in in her development as much as as other people have so 

208.71 210.72 B: right okay 

209.69 212.62 A: that changes the dynamics of the whole thing too [mn] 

212.33 214.82 B: yeah yeah definitely 

214.86 222.52 B: yeah it's weird my girlfriend her her brother is like ten years older than she is so there was kinda that same thing going on but i see them now and how they 

222.49 236.25 B: how they interact and he had so much influence on her like had her listening to you know the music that he was listening to as a teenager you know when she was five years old and stuff so [laughter] it's kinda but i guess he was more present for you know that kind of stuff like he went to 

236.28 245.94 B: went to school in illinois and now [mn] i'm in chicago now too i just moved ba- moved here from ah new york and i grew up kinda well i grew up way outside of chicago so 

245.82 247.24 A: (( mm )) 

246.07 257.21 B: it's kinda like i've just come home but yeah and i haven't even seen my family at this point like i've i've seen my sister but that's it i haven't seen my dad and my brother or my mom or 

257.35 259.99 B: yeah so [laughter] 

259.09 267.56 A: [mn] well do you learn from do you think that the the relationship that your like you said your girlfriend had a brother do you think that you learn from 

268.06 272.78 A: the relationship that you see them have do you try and implement that into your enti- your own life or 

272.92 273.91 A: (( is it [mn] )) 

272.95 286.86 B: um y- yeah somewhat i guess so like my sister and i are are much closer probably than you know than any you know there's a brother as well than my brother and i are than my sister and my brother so we're the closest siblings i would say 

286.95 289.37 B: but um 

289.54 290.87 B: (( yeah i don't know i guess )) 

290.70 304.35 B: [mn] the way i see it i guess more like their fa- family dynamic is just really good to to see and to be around just to see how the parents kinda like um you know are always present like her um her brother and sister both have children so 

304.20 307.21 B: they're always around for the grandkids and they're always willing to 

307.22 308.11 B: you know 

308.32 318.69 B: go and do things ah as a family and they set things up like this last weekend it was the sister's um birthday so they celebrated that they all got together and you know just 

318.60 333.21 B: [mn] just doing different activities and really i don't know planning things around family events and tying their lives kind of around family events whereas my own family it's just sort of like oh i'll talk to you every coupla months and see how you're doing you know 

330.65 331.90 A: [laughter] 

332.61 334.69 A: yeah that's how mine is and 

333.05 333.64 B: (( [laughter] )) 

334.10 335.05 B: yeah 

334.72 338.08 A: and we don't do holidays really either so that was a new 

338.23 343.26 A: kind of thing for me to see too when they make a big de- deal out of birthdays or holidays or whatever 

343.04 343.99 B: uh-huh 

343.39 348.26 A: it was that was a new experience for me for a family to get together for that 

348.11 349.52 B: yeah 

348.30 354.19 A: 'cause if mine get together for a holiday there was like four people there it wasn't exactly a huge gathering [mn] 

353.46 362.84 B: right right yeah big aunts and uncles and does your girl- ah your fiance do that they have like you know aunts and uncles and extended family and sort of thing 

361.37 373.99 A: yeah except hers are hers are spread out like a lot of her family's in mich- her sister lives in michigan part of her family lives in minnesota she has a brother in italy and then her f- her parents live in florida 

373.87 374.80 B: uh-huh 

374.07 382.64 A: so they don't get together very often but when they do it's like this huge event we went to her niece's high school graduation party a coupla months ago 

382.51 383.42 B: uh-huh 

382.74 396.43 A: and there were there were like fifty people there i i was i was getting just this weird like claustrophobic feeling 'cause i'm not used to going to events with that many people especially family and it was the weirdest thing to me it was so 

384.84 385.72 B: (( oh man )) 

391.47 392.58 B: yeah 

396.33 407.26 A: it was so different than what i was used to and everybody's nice and they come up and they wanna talk and after a while you just wanna like go into the house and be alone for a while [laughter] exactly 

404.54 406.09 B: find a room and 

406.66 414.73 B: yeah yeah oh i can totally see that [mn] did you family do like a lot of events like [mn] you know just the four of you when you were kids and stuff well 

414.05 416.16 A: yeah yeah be- 

415.14 416.39 B: young [mn] 

416.12 430.87 A: because my my mom was a single parent so like my grand- my grandfather died when i was young so it was me my sister my mom and my grandmother and that was pretty much it so like my grandmother would help out and watch the kids or you know drive us wherever we needed to go so it was kind of 

424.92 426.37 B: oh okay 

430.75 433.09 A: that was the family unit right there 

432.69 433.80 B: right 

433.20 439.13 A: and you know [mn] i have i have an aunt and uncle but i never saw them and cousins that i never 

437.74 439.45 B: (( they were in seattle or )) 

439.23 445.33 A: they were they lived on the other side of the state and they just didn't get along that well my my mother and her siblings 

445.31 446.28 B: yeah 

445.46 451.03 A: so it was just this weird kind of dynamic but now now that i've moved 

451.09 455.78 A: three quarters of the way across the country suddenly they're all starting to get along again 

455.86 469.47 A: and they're all starting to create this family unit that i'm not that involved in because i'm way out here so that so that's diff- that spins the idea of family too 'cause they have a different idea of what family is versus what i do 

461.01 462.07 B: oh man 

469.20 470.67 B: yeah yeah 

469.77 473.79 A: because they're creating their own that's kind of rough sometimes 

472.17 473.06 B: yeah 

473.65 485.76 B: that's i don't know it's really crazy to hear you say that 'cause my mom and her brother have recently like started getting together more and they hadn't really um you know before that you know they're both like in their their later fifties 

474.53 475.09 A: (( [mn] )) 

485.70 500.60 B: so and now they're you know they didn't talk for i would say a period of maybe ten years or something and now they're getting together a lot more after their parents died [mn] um but yeah and they lived you know maybe sorta half an hour an hour from each other at various times you know 

499.95 502.36 A: i think that's more common than we think though 

502.19 503.18 B: yeah 

502.59 505.31 A: 'cause i know in my family there were a couple 

505.59 511.49 A: when i was young i remember stories about like my grandmother and her sister would didn't talk for five years 

511.50 522.65 A: or my fiance's sis- ah mother and her sister didn't talk for a few years and it seems like such a bizarre concept to just not talk to somebody forever 

511.55 512.32 B: (( [mn] )) 

522.55 524.51 B: yeah yeah 

523.51 527.49 A: and but i guess it's something that happens more than we think [mn] 

526.99 540.92 B: [mn] yeah yeah i don't know it's it it does seem that way i guess but i don't know i guess i've just sort of gravitated to people who've kinda been like a little closer to siblings like my girlfriend and i don't know my friends that have had like a little bit closer families 

540.83 547.00 B: so yeah i know that stuff like happens out there but yeah i guess i like to see that more um 

546.77 555.97 B: you know people who are closer like that but then again i'm kinda guilty of that because my brother i i talk to him i i guess i talk to him probably like once a month or so 

556.17 568.65 B: which is i guess probably better than that situation you know having somebody who just moved across the country but yeah it it makes a difference too i think when you share kinda like an experience you know like if your growing up was i don't know [mn] 

562.19 562.75 A: (( [mn] )) 

568.57 579.41 B: you know you know you lived in the same house and you were around the same age and you know my parents got divorced and that was you know a big deal to go through and kinda like i guess a connection sorta forms 

579.17 588.61 A: yeah that could that could do that but i only i mean my sister and i i talk to her once every four or five months maybe 

581.67 582.49 B: yeah 

587.95 589.32 B: oh really 

588.77 599.89 A: yeah it's not i don't see it like i went back to my fiance and i went back to spend christmas with my family last year and my sister couldn't even come up 'cause she
