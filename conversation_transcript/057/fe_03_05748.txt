90.49 101.62 B: you know in in high school although they weren't um you know we'd have like one computer class if we registered for it otherwise we didn't really use computers but um [mn] yeah i mean 

101.39 112.23 B: at this point i really support um the usage of computers in education [mn] um you know all the way down through elementary school um just because we're live we live in such a 

112.11 118.81 B: highly digital world you know i mean i think it's really important that people start young getting the computer skills [mn] 

118.63 123.42 A: yeah my daughter's uh my daughter's seven she's in the second grade 

121.42 122.31 B: uh-huh 

123.37 124.50 B: mhm

138.15 139.17 B: mhm 

138.32 139.49 A: uh 

139.51 149.39 A: for research and [sigh] you know things things like that so that she can get comfortable looking around on the on the internet and on the computer 

146.07 147.00 B: (( that's cool )) 

149.23 150.52 B: mhm 

149.65 151.19 A: [noise] but uh 

151.67 159.18 A: i don't know sometimes i'm a little concerned about the exposure that she's gotten off of the internet 'cause [laughter] i walked in a couple of times on 

156.22 157.64 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

159.25 163.39 A: some of the teen chatrooms that she was in and my goodness 

161.17 162.21 B: (( [laughter] )) 

163.15 168.49 B: yeah yeah that's true that that's definitely one one drawback on the internet 

167.63 170.18 A: kind of makes you wonder who's on the other end you know 

169.59 178.75 B: yeah yeah i mean there's a there's a lot of i'm sure you've heard stories lots of scary stuff [sigh] has happened um you know through like chatrooms and stuff 

178.52 179.72 A: yeah 

179.09 187.57 B: um [lipsmack] but yeah like in terms of education um i i realize you know i you know and i just graduated now and [noise] 

187.76 199.28 B: whenever i have to write a paper whenever i was writing papers i could organize my thoughts i'd say like so much better on the word processor than than on paper um you know and then of course i wouldn't lose the paper [laughter] um 

195.15 196.04 A: (( mhm )) 

198.10 199.79 A: (( [mn] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

199.12 211.01 B: so yeah it it definitely proved helpful in you know was was i was able to get my work done you know quicker and i think um come out with a better product if i used my computer you know 

210.13 213.07 A: well it just seems like the research is so much easier to do 

213.12 215.01 B: oh yeah that's for sure 

213.75 221.61 A: you know and it doesn't take all day to go to the library prepare for a ten page paper and then all of a sudden [sigh] you know in an hour 

216.70 218.50 B: mhm 

221.36 224.09 B: mhm yeah 

222.30 225.47 A: i can have everything done including 

225.64 228.48 A: my footnotes and citing all my references 

228.54 229.69 B: (( [noise] definitely )) 

229.96 235.80 A: my uh my dad just uh just retired and uh went back and got his masters [sigh] 

230.05 230.83 B: (( yeah it's )) 

233.07 233.94 B: uh-huh 

235.54 237.39 B: mhm 

236.24 237.50 A: and uh 

238.77 242.33 A: [sigh] you know he he bought a laptop so he could take it to class with him [mn] 

242.33 244.14 B: right 

243.42 245.05 A: and he had a microphone 

245.15 255.22 A: so that he could uh record lectures and he could take notes at the same time as it was recording i mean it was unbelievable 

245.31 246.29 B: (( oh yeah [mn] )) 

254.86 255.85 B: wow 

255.45 258.00 A: it was as if he didn't even really need to be there [noise] 

257.66 258.79 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

259.22 267.97 B: yeah yeah i m- and you know that's i guess the only problem i could see with computers is that um you know like 

268.06 276.13 B: uh i think they could start to possibly take the place of the student you know where i know they now have keyboards where all they have to do is talk 

275.80 276.74 A: right 

276.09 287.38 B: um and that's you know that's that that like really changes the writing process i think where you know putting something down on paper or typing it onto a computer it's it's a different process than speaking you know 

287.38 295.71 B: um so just speaking at just speaking to the computer and then having that you know written down i don't know [sigh] um definitely a different thing 

296.29 299.64 A: yeah that that [lipsmack] i think it's uh 

299.90 307.38 A: important that as much as we're going to computers i mean i'm pretty that was one of the reasons we chose the school that we did for my daughter 'cause 

305.93 306.69 B: (( so mhm )) 

308.33 312.82 A: you know some of the some of the schools in the area don't have that type of exposure until 

313.01 315.02 A: you know fifth and sixth grade 

314.53 315.69 B: (( right mm [noise] )) 

315.12 325.18 A: and by then you know three four years down the road who knows what the computer world will be like i mean it could it could pass her by and she could be 

321.07 322.86 B: mhm 

325.77 328.08 A: left in the dust 

327.49 341.66 B: yeah yeah i mean i definitely again think it's it's really essential for [noise] for young kids to get started on there and and you know while there while there are things that that kids can get exposed to on the internet that are are definitely negative 

341.59 343.61 B: there's also it's also just you know 

343.83 350.19 B: such a giant database of of knowledge you know um you know she can check out what's happening in 

350.30 353.19 B: different different cultures you know throughout the world 

353.18 357.91 A: well yeah we saved a ton of money 'cause now they've got all the encyclopedias online 

353.45 354.21 B: so 

355.33 356.32 B: yeah 

357.90 358.86 B: mhm 

358.16 362.05 A: so she can just go to you know encyclopedia britannica 

361.91 363.07 B: mhm 

362.45 365.04 A: type up her subject and find out about 

365.06 371.76 A: things and not have to worry about spending a thousand dollars to get a [sigh] encyclopedia that'll be outdated in 

367.47 368.68 B: yeah 

371.50 373.15 B: (( right right )) 

371.80 373.23 A: four or five years 

373.16 380.70 B: i definitely use the the internet for [mn] um a dictionary uh all the time whenever i'm writing a paper just you know 

380.66 395.38 B: instead of carrying round a dictionary just look in dictionary dot com same thing for recipes actually whenever i'm cooking you know [laughter] it's pretty easy just type in what what you're thinking about um what kind of ingredients you have and [mn] you know [lipsmack] 

384.62 385.50 A: yeah 

386.71 389.48 A: [laughter]

417.07 420.05 A: so that was a lot of uh a lot of research 

420.13 425.34 B: oh yeah yeah it was definitely research intensive i did a few independent studies um 

425.18 436.13 B: you know where i i studied specific social movement and we just spent hours and hours and days and days in the library um [mn] of course you know always using the computers

499.89 501.60 B: (( right right )) 

500.40 503.45 A: take a lot longer and it'd be a lot more money for me

509.31 510.10 B: (( you know )) 

509.63 516.51 A: uh it was i mean i i all the information i get now i would have had to call people i would have had to send letters uh

516.82 524.64 A: you know send people out to court houses to pull up documents and you know it's it's just at my fingertips 

521.46 522.62 B: right 

524.54 526.44 B: yeah it's great

536.43 544.43 B: um you know just just real great component of um you know cities and towns throughout the country you know i think they're 

544.60 555.42 B: just a good place to go um to spend some time looking through books sitting around reading um you know just there's just something really nice about h- having a book you know 

554.91 557.10 A: yeah being able to touch it 

555.38 562.37 B: in your hand yeah versus looking at a looking at a computer screen that after a while hurts your eyes you know
