0.90 2.06 B: (( hello )) 

1.64 3.28 A: hello how are you 

3.34 4.90 B: fine how are you [mn] 

4.41 6.80 A: excellent i'm wally 

6.86 8.30 B: (( uh my name's debra )) 

8.23 9.53 A: hi debra 

9.28 10.24 B: hi 

10.00 12.79 A: do you know anything about computers in school 

12.97 20.85 B: uh actually not too much no i've been out of school so long i barely remember where i went so [laughter] hmm 

18.70 20.15 A: (( [sigh] hmm )) 

21.08 22.77 B: [lipsmack] how about you 

21.77 22.47 A: (( d- )) 

22.65 24.38 A: um well 

24.45 27.00 A: [lipsmack] i'm actually an instructional designer 

27.13 28.42 B: oh okay 

27.38 31.67 A: um and work with uh e-learning and such 

31.80 35.38 A: so uh and i do some development of 

35.72 37.45 A: for adult education 

37.53 43.76 A: um using the web but i wasn't sure if they were more talking about elementary school 

43.39 49.70 B: [mn] that's what i assumed when i heard yeah i assumed that when i heard the topic that they meant elementary school 

43.95 45.35 A: and kids 

49.45 51.98 A: that's what i thought too do you have kids 

52.11 54.65 B: uh no i don't [mn] not yet 

53.78 55.88 A: mm not yet you want some 

55.33 57.86 B: [laughter] [mn] yeah sure in the future 

59.52 63.23 A: well you sound very young so it sounds like you got a long way to go [lipsmack] 

61.48 62.86 B: [laughter] 

63.11 66.45 B: [laughter] not really do you have children okay [noise] 

66.67 68.74 A: i have two one and four 

68.83 73.26 A: so i've been um introducing my four year old to 

73.27 74.99 A: um the computer 

75.09 77.99 A: and i don't know i think that uh 

78.71 90.02 A: i think at this point we we can't go backwards it's too late to decide whether or not we i- if computers help or not because i think children are going to be 

90.93 94.04 A: you know surrounded by computers 

93.94 95.08 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

94.52 99.71 A: and if they don't have the computers in school and if they're not learning using computers 

99.76 101.04 A: then 

101.35 106.85 A: i think children will find it their school life not relevant 

106.81 111.22 B: right and then that would yeah i know what you mean 

108.01 109.19 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

112.15 121.50 B: and what about those kids i'm just thinking here d- i mean believe it or not there are still some people that don't have computers for their children to use at home 

121.49 125.67 A: [lipsmack] yeah so there's a challenge there 

121.88 123.37 B: (( you know in other )) 

125.21 126.39 B: (( hm )) 

125.75 129.75 A: indeed 'cause what happens if the homework is computer based 

130.54 131.70 B: that's true 

131.68 133.30 A: how does that happen 

134.34 136.34 B: (( i never thought of that interesting )) 

134.44 135.90 A: um 

137.43 138.55 A: so 

138.86 142.88 A: i don't know i mean i guess they could just do it where 

142.98 144.37 A: um 

146.71 151.00 A: you get your homework done at school or they give you time at school for labs 

151.07 153.14 B: mhm 

152.10 154.47 A: [lipsmack] and then your 

154.57 158.48 A: your homework is just you know paper based or something 

159.06 161.07 B: (( right )) 

160.05 161.51 A: but that's tough 

161.63 164.17 B: yeah that that's that's a lot 

164.26 168.97 B: (( um and i i don't see these the schools here i'm in new york city )) 

169.22 180.11 B: um i don't see the public schools for instance here making extra time for students to stay and do lab work or do their homework in school and use the computers 

180.84 181.75 B: um 

181.78 184.01 B: (( seeing that everything's being cut i )) 

184.41 189.81 B: know thing about well over a year ago there was an issue where um 

190.25 194.57 B: [lipsmack] al bloomberg was saying that uh we need to go back to 

194.93 203.56 B: pencils and paper and you know and arithmetic and reading and math and just concentrate on that and get rid of the computers in schools 

203.63 205.63 B: (( uh 'cause he felt that )) 

205.84 217.31 B: by the time these kids graduate whatever it is they're whatever computers they were using and software they were using in school would be obsolete by the time they graduated and that was the point 

215.72 216.68 A: (( mm )) 

217.81 219.19 B: (( so i mean tha- )) 

219.28 225.30 B: that was interesting 'cause there are a lot of uh kids in the public school who 

225.57 228.65 B: do go through the school system and [sigh] 

229.02 233.05 B: just aren't reading at the level that they should be reading once they graduate but i 

233.51 234.73 A: yeah 

233.76 236.46 B: think that was sort of his point 

237.28 238.98 B: what do you think about that 

239.00 243.27 A: [lipsmack] well i think there's a lot of um there's a lot to that 

244.38 254.49 A: i think [noise] that we're still young in how our educational material is communicated and used on the web 

254.58 255.59 B: mhm 

255.00 258.43 A: so i think it's not as good as it's going to be 

258.97 259.80 B: (( okay )) 

259.07 270.38 A: so there probably is a lot of you know holes and and barriers to proper education but i believe that there's a lot of there's been a lot of um 

271.46 281.28 A: you know process made in that um i i think with everything there needs to be balance i think s- a kid still has to have a reading assignment and has to read a book 

281.14 282.48 B: (( mhm right )) 

281.87 285.28 A: um and they should also 

286.08 288.35 A: but the whole thing about having to 

288.74 293.14 A: y- i think you can learn math on a computer just as well as you can in a book 

293.50 294.88 B: mhm 

294.34 305.60 A: with a workbook where you write the stuff down i don't see why [mn] i mean you know 'cause of course that's weird 'cause like you get some sort of excel spreadsheet that's doing all of your calculations for you 

307.16 307.74 A: (( [mn] )) 

307.92 310.06 A: um [sigh] 

310.24 312.95 A: you know do you need to know how to 

313.51 320.38 A: ever know how to do a square root in your head when you could always have a computer do it for you or your watch 

317.96 318.52 B: (( [mn] )) 

320.56 323.24 A: you know every watch is going to be a computer soon 

322.19 325.34 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] or your cell phone [laughter] 

324.21 329.60 A: or your cell phone so if you're at the grocery store and you have to calculate whether or not this is a good deal or not 

325.96 327.01 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

329.96 332.42 A: you could just do it there [mn] 

332.59 342.58 A: um yeah i don't know but then what happens when you're you're out camping and you don't have all your electrical devices and you want to do some math figure out how to save your life 

342.57 344.22 B: [laughter] 

343.68 348.47 A: crossing a river that's going thirty miles an hour and [laughter] 

348.90 351.43 B: okay i'd drown [laughter] 

350.24 353.73 A: [laughter] whether you had your fancy watch or not 

352.26 352.88 B: (( with )) 

353.48 356.08 B: or without it [laughter] i'm done 

355.79 359.08 A: yeah [mn] well i think there has to be a balance 

359.10 366.87 A: um [lipsmack] but i think you know i think like wh- what i originally said there's no the the question that they gave us 

367.17 372.82 A: you know i- i- is it valuable or is it a good thing or n- i think at that point it's too late 

373.36 374.24 B: mhm 

373.46 380.62 A: it's i think the schools have to embrace it and go with it because 

378.93 380.03 B: (( sure )) 

381.61 390.06 A: that's what's you know the the the kids will lead the charge they'll go to their friends' houses that have the playstation two 

390.10 391.23 B: mhm 

390.26 394.11 A: and they will learn how to use the computer whether it's in school or not 

394.05 397.50 B: this is true and the more they're exposed to the better 

395.01 396.01 A: and 

398.43 408.06 A: yeah no kidding and and so here's your here's your homework assignment um learn about spain [cough] and so you so the old way was to go to the library and get 

399.91 402.09 B: couldn't hurt too [laughter] 

402.25 403.20 B: mhm 

408.15 410.48 A: what two or three books on spain 

410.26 411.38 B: mhm 

410.84 415.61 A: [lipsmack] and read them and take forever or now you can search on the web 

416.29 418.31 A: and get so much more 

418.67 428.09 A: and you you get moving pictures and videos and people talking to you and [sigh] that has to se- to me it has to better 

422.85 424.25 B: (( right )) 

428.34 432.17 A: 'cause uh you know kids are sponges as you mention and they they'll just [sigh] 

432.18 438.37 A: the more they see the more they'll learn so just i think it's a better way to communicate more stuff 

438.61 440.59 B: mhm i agree 

440.26 441.61 A: i think it's good [mn] 

441.76 456.57 B: i mean i'm amazed i mean my niece is seven and i'm amazed at you know what she can already do on a computer and how quickly she she picks things up i mean you can show her something once and and she's ready to go [laughter] 

448.76 450.03 A: mhm 

455.71 457.04 A: yeah 

456.46 460.43 B: you know and she's just so fascinated by it all which is great 

459.14 469.55 A: so what are you going to what are you going to say when your taxes go up because they have to put a uh new computers in the school which they just did two years ago but now they're outdated 

469.49 473.38 B: [mn] well you know if it's for education i mean 

473.56 478.59 B: i'm sure i don't even know half of the things that my tax money goes to 

478.73 487.77 B: first of all i mean but for education i mean how do you how do you say no to that i mean it it's worth the extra money i mean 

479.66 480.58 A: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

488.55 494.90 A: unless you're the p- type of person that says get them back to paper and pencil and we don't have to have these extra charges every two years 

496.31 500.67 B: (( [mn] so that was the idea [laughter] )) 

498.81 504.50 A: you're wasting our money by dumping it into some software that's going to be obsolete in two years 

501.15 502.92 B: mhm 

504.58 505.37 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

506.29 507.75 A: it's a tough one 

507.91 508.93 B: (( it is tough )) 

508.58 510.98 A: 'cause they're always trying to get more money out of you [sigh] 

511.33 512.81 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

512.79 516.90 A: and you're getting yourself into a losing battle of trying to keep up with technology 

518.75 520.18 B: do you really think so 

521.03 523.00 B: trying to keep up with it 

522.54 527.59 A: [mn] well just like you said what happens when the computers are outdated 

528.41 531.51 A: don't they have to update 'em get new computers in the school 

531.37 532.59 B: that's true 

533.05 537.13 B: mm but then again i g- you can look at it as you have something to build on 

537.80 545.70 B: you know uh what's worse having u- once used an you know an a system that's now obsolete or having not used anything at all 

547.89 554.06 A: it all depends if you're you know in that canoe and and you need to do the math on your fingers to save your life 

552.47 558.85 B: [laughter] we we already went through this if i'm in the canoe [laughter] it's already 

554.68 555.69 A: [laughter] 

556.27 558.21 A: oh [laughter] 

559.54 564.17 B: [laughter] i'm in i'm already hopeless [laughter] 

563.18 568.34 A: yeah well yeah i don't know it it seems like um [sigh] 

564.78 565.63 B: (( [mn] that's )) 

569.23 571.08 A: it just seems like 

571.61 577.45 A: we can't go backwards and i i mean i like the idea that children can also communicate with other children 

577.46 581.96 A: around the world using computers and i think that's an educational 

582.20 584.89 A: uh thing that you can never do with books 

585.21 586.73 B: (( true definitely )) 

586.03 599.89 A: you might get some quotes from from some oth- some you know some some other person around the planet but to actually see some kid in somalia talking on the computer about their life or or having a chatroom with somebody from fr-
