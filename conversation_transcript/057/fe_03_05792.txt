2.86 4.69 A: (( all right )) 

3.78 6.24 B: so do you want to start the start the topic off 

6.07 7.10 A: say that again 

6.83 8.12 B: ready to start off 

8.21 11.03 A: ah family what you um 

9.20 10.34 B: yeah 

11.56 14.28 A: what does family mean well i ah 

14.55 21.72 A: ah i don't have a family myself other than my parents and and my cousins and things like that um 

19.44 21.18 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

21.60 33.50 A: but ah i guess when i think of family i just ah i think of them of course and and ah [mn] people that are are you know close to me and and sort of people that are some of my friends really 

32.37 33.96 B: mhm 

34.31 41.80 B: ah my thoughts of family is um [mn] well i have a small ah right now just you know i i you know i'm not married or anything yet um 

41.76 44.43 B: but to me in general family is just people that you know 

44.28 51.37 B: you know are going to be there for you um that you can tr- you trust them ah [sigh] a lot it's a lot of values to it to me you know 

51.24 60.28 B: i think the main thing is being able to just spend precious moments with them and being able to do things and knowing that they're there for you that's the main important ingredient to our family 

51.57 53.17 A: right 

59.54 65.94 A: right right um one ah one thing one thing i read somewhere once that i thought was good is ah a 

66.07 69.57 A: friend will help you move but family will help you move a body 

69.82 71.62 A: so that's ah that's 

70.06 73.97 B: exac- exactly that's that a good statement right there 

73.23 76.80 A: [laughter] yeah that's probably a good way to describe it i i thought 

74.64 76.02 B: [laughter] it is 

77.19 83.70 A: um what ah ah what what s- oh so so you don't have any family now right 

82.58 85.11 B: mm mm not yet i'm still young 

84.23 85.14 A: (( got ya )) 

85.30 89.22 A: i got ya are are you are you planning to do you know if you will or 

87.55 93.46 B: yeah i yeah definitely i want to have one definitely um my my main thing is um just being basically 

89.75 90.67 A: okay 

93.91 106.64 B: the one time 'cause it's just being a good father you know being there you know for my you know ch- ah son or daughter you know basically just being a good role model 'cause i think that's also another thing about family they instill a lot of values in how to live 

98.62 101.16 A: (( mhm )) 

107.14 120.44 B: you know they those are the basic principles you know you deal with them when you come in the world those are the first basically people you deal with when it comes to how to live how to carry yourself you know nobody else shows you they give you the outline um 

107.17 108.47 A: (( right uh-huh )) 

116.98 118.64 A: right 

121.11 123.41 B: [mn] it's ah it's important it's just 

123.51 135.03 B: because like i said they they have to give you a strong outline on how to live your life because if you don't have that foundation of how to live the life the right way you're really messed you know it's really a messed up situation how it what you could become 

127.45 129.09 A: right 

134.67 141.11 A: right right ah and and and and an- another thing i think of when um you know when i think family i think of um 

135.51 137.87 B: (( ah but )) 

141.41 147.04 A: just i i sort of think of a place which i guess you could say is home but i sort of think of a place or a group of people or 

147.05 159.46 A: or whatever that you can that you just you can be comfortable with and you can let your guard down and and and you can feel at home um if you will and not like ah you're you're subject to all the the rigors of the rest of the world 

153.29 154.99 B: mhm 

158.71 170.51 B: yeah exactly you know when you come home like you said from the you know from this crazy world you know and you close the door you want to have that you know that feeling with you being secure being safe feeling comfortable 

165.47 167.18 A: (( [cough] yeah )) 

170.33 172.06 A: yeah 

170.72 175.38 B: you know that's that's ah that's very important when one deals with family and um 

175.53 181.10 B: the main ingredient to it is trust 'cause if you don't trust any members of your family you there's a serious situation there because 

181.40 183.62 B: if you can't trust your family who can you trust 

183.04 188.70 A: exactly exactly if if if you family is not your ally then um 

184.76 186.56 B: (( ah but )) 

188.40 189.40 B: yeah 

188.80 191.80 A: then who is you know then then you're in a bad place 

189.65 190.78 B: exactly 

191.43 200.80 B: and let's even look at it from this you know people that don't really have immediate families you know what kind of outlets do you do they have you know sometimes they just make like a network of friends and they call that a family like you know 

200.85 208.41 B: call call it crazy but you know some people sometimes you hear like kids are now just saying that the gangs that they belong to that's their family because um 

206.74 208.46 A: yeah 

208.49 211.60 B: you know they probably don't have their own and probably they they they were disowned 

211.74 212.78 B: um 

213.45 218.27 B: so it's like [laughter] family doesn't even really have to be blood in situations like that they could be 

217.99 219.56 A: right 

218.19 221.13 B: um just people that you know you know 

220.99 223.31 B: that could give you that bond that you need you know 

223.10 229.11 B: sometimes like if a situation happens give you a roof over your head put some food in your stomach you know put a few dollars in your pocket you know 

228.60 229.92 A: mm yeah that's true 

228.90 238.62 B: people like that you could also consider family 'cause you know that's what family is supposed to do for each other they're supposed to look out for each other if one is down you have to pick up the they're the ones that have to pick up the slack a little bit help 'em out mhm 

232.90 234.59 A: yeah 

238.01 241.05 A: right right exact- that that's very true actually because um 

241.33 247.38 A: my ah my i i i grew up with my parents here in new york but the rest of my family was was all abroad in europe 

246.71 248.05 B: (( mhm mhm mhm mhm )) 

247.50 248.43 A: um 

248.50 252.78 A: and now sometimes if they were there there was another ah family that lived um 

253.32 262.63 A: a few houses down from us and i was friends with the the kids in the family and they became very you know very close friends of the family and we all became friends and a lot of times when um 

262.68 277.01 A: things weren't going so well at home or whatever i would just go over there and i'd i there were times where i'd din- dinner there almost every night and they they weren't really family by blood but like you said they were ah they were so close and you know they were always there and supportive and so on 

277.00 282.56 A: but um really they they they're as close as as you can get to family without 

281.10 287.77 B: yeah like i have a like my b- my best friend's a i've known him since kindergarten and his family's like a second family to me you know 

287.73 289.38 A: right 

287.78 294.32 B: um you know like if there's ever been a situation like i need a place to stay like my grandmother that i live with she was in the hospital a few years' ago 

294.39 298.07 B: and i needed really you know i just really like a place to stay kind of 

298.08 303.89 B: and they you know opened their arms saying you know as long as you just stay you know just stay here just as long as possible you know 

303.92 307.27 B: whatever you need to do whatever you need you know w- we're going to help you out 

307.39 313.16 B: and that really makes you feel good you know knowing that you have somebody like that outside of family that could really um 

313.77 317.95 B: you know be able just to open their doors and hearts to you like that 

317.15 320.25 A: right right 

320.36 322.97 A: um what about ah 

323.44 328.88 A: (( well i guess we talked about family values right we did that thing that kind of thing )) 

325.70 327.43 B: mhm 

328.92 330.44 B: traditions 

329.02 329.92 A: (( i don't know )) 

330.18 340.03 A: traditions yeah that's true sure a a lot of times when i think of family i somehow the holidays also pop into mind christmas and thanksgiving and 

336.35 343.10 B: oh yeah that's definite yeah that's definite that's ah 'cause that's usually the time you know in the year you really get to see everybody 

340.18 341.78 A: (( and )) 

343.20 344.83 A: yeah 

343.79 347.58 B: you know and ah that's that's that's where all the fun begins you know 'cause ah 

346.94 348.62 A: (( uh-huh right )) 

347.62 354.30 B: [laughter] rather than just going out you know rather than just watching t._v. watching the football the the lions game on thanksgiving or 

354.10 355.40 A: [laughter] 

354.44 355.61 B: (( ah )) 

355.44 365.75 B: [laughter] as sorry as that may sound but [laughter] or ah just you know you know you know watching t._v. playing football in the snow or whatever like during the holidays 

357.80 359.09 A: (( no no i got ya )) 

360.16 361.74 A: (( [mn] )) 

365.52 371.33 B: you know stuff like that that's you know that's one thing to look forward to when you have family you know moments like that moments you can cher- you know 

365.81 367.51 A: yeah 

371.45 374.51 B: moments that are like you know wow you know we had fun you know 

374.58 377.82 B: 'cause it's like when you do things like that you can just feel the love mhm 

374.60 375.52 A: yeah 

376.82 388.18 A: yeah yeah there's al- there's also i'd say there's also a a cer- a cer- certain amount of strength that comes from from family or being a part of a family um or being in a family um 

387.09 388.72 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

388.27 400.67 A: on the one hand just being a you know knowing that you can always rely on someone and knowing that ah you don't have to watch your back or anything like that um and on the other knowing that there's you know there's some place you can go and talk about things or 

391.35 392.63 B: (( mhm right )) 

394.22 395.95 B: right 

400.83 410.15 A: or be your be yourself or be who you are or you know just sort of let loose and and not and not not really worry about you know the rest of the world 

402.88 404.35 B: mhm 

405.75 407.17 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

409.09 413.03 B: mhm yeah and also like it helps you really just like rediscover yourself also 

413.09 414.30 A: right 

413.75 421.10 B: you know they really you know being with family really helps you like just really discover yourself if you feel lousy and you have no clue where to go you know it's always good to have them near 

420.61 422.65 A: right yeah that's true 

422.37 423.76 B: and especially um 

424.03 428.82 B: you really see who your family is really when times of crisis arise that's the way that's the way i look at life 

428.93 430.13 A: say say that again 

429.74 433.89 B: you really see who your family really is when times of crisis arrive 

432.56 435.19 A: oh yeah yeah that's true 

433.91 440.34 B: arise because that's where you separ- like that's that'd be like a saying of um that's where you separate the men from the boys so to speak 

439.81 441.63 A: right right that's true 

440.49 446.79 B: you know you see who's there you see who's really there for you who really cares for you and really who's just you know 

447.13 449.75 B: and for the rotter who really doesn't give a damn you know 

449.69 452.28 A: yeah yeah 

450.95 461.42 B: you know 'cause i had a i had a situation this year i lost my mother a year ago and i really saw who my family was 'cause you know all the people that really came out and you know helped helped us you know get everything together and stuff like that and ah 

453.44 455.87 A: oh really saw who 

456.21 458.17 A: (( [noise] )) 

461.49 464.52 B: it you know really gave me a 

465.25 474.22 B: it really you know showed me something 'cause even like i i haven't seen family in years they were like you know come over this that you know we haven't seen you let's you know spend some time you know just things like that they have to um 

465.48 467.11 A: yeah 

475.06 480.56 B: really ah just really just open their hearts to you like you know hey you know we're here for you you know and that really shows a lot 

479.03 480.66 A: yeah 

480.59 490.12 B: for being a family you know you know in times of crisis like that you know they really just you know step up to the plate and um [mn] you know open their h- open their homes and whatever they may have 

482.19 483.43 A: (( uh-huh right )) 

489.53 496.94 A: right right right actually my father is um he's pretty old he's he's eighty years' old right now and he's he's pretty sick 

496.96 502.17 A: and ah one thing that i'm finding sort of difficult ah to deal with is that 

501.98 512.71 A: he's he's starting to lose it a little bit so he he what sometimes he'll need a medical procedure or need some some some medication to take or or what have you 

512.94 525.56 A: and he just doesn't want to he doesn't want to do it or he doesn't want to take it and um he's my father and i i want to do what's the best thing for him but it's it's tough because sometimes that what and and and by doing that he'll he'll i guess in his 

517.82 519.93 B: (( mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm )) 

525.82 539.66 A: in in in his mental state that he's in now he's not really understanding what what what it's about and he he sometimes thinks that people are against him when they're not and that kind of thing and ah that's really tough actually 

529.41 531.02 B: (( mhm right yeah mhm )) 

535.43 537.14 B: right right right 

538.44 540.21 B: yeah that is it's like 

539.70 540.45 A: um 

540.43 551.69 B: i w- i wouldn't even know like how to s- you know say in a situation like that 'cause like you don't want to say the wrong thing but it's like it's just tough you know and you know i i have my grandmother here and i can even tell you you know she's really like stubborn [laughter] you know when it comes to 

546.96 548.69 A: yeah 

551.62 560.23 B: you know wanting to go to the doctor and this and that and you know she's you know real stubborn so i really i have an idea what you're talking about you know like it's just that 

553.14 555.70 A: uh-huh [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

559.24 561.01 A: yeah 

560.23 569.99 B: you know that feeling but it you know it's just the strength they have you know when it's something that you can see like even like you know in yourself probably l- like you know when you get older you probably see that stubbornness or 

570.04 572.07 B: little ah features and stuff 

572.24 574.69 A: (( yeah yeah i don't know )) 

574.29 579.29 B: but um the main topic i think i forgot was sacrifice 

578.34 581.75 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

579.87 582.24 B: that's something else that families have to do with so 

582.49 585.78 B: i guess it's just step it up just stepping it up for when somebody's down 

582.89 584.79 A: that's true 

585.77 588.94 A: yeah for each other for each other no doubt 

586.81 588.63 B: yeah you know that's ah 

588.67 593.89 B: that's very important because like let's say even it could be something as small as you know 

593.94 599.95 B: i want ice cream and you know somebody else wants soda you know you may be down to your last dollar you got you know where
