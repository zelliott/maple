19.59 20.50 A: yeah 

20.39 22.67 B: right on so education 

22.73 25.13 A: yeah computers affecting education 

24.88 27.53 B: yeah go ahead start it up 

25.63 26.74 A: um 

26.98 32.34 A: me i 'member uh well i'm twenty five i 'member having computers 

27.79 29.00 B: yeah 

32.41 36.70 A: in third grade fourth grade those real old computers 

32.71 33.27 B: (( [mn] )) 

34.98 35.81 B: yeah 

36.24 38.11 B: (( yeah yeah i had the same ones )) 

36.96 40.33 A: that was about the start of it for me um 

41.04 42.98 A: i don't know i i guess uh 

43.10 50.59 A: i think computers are are good but in a way they make things a little too easy in terms of research and stuff when i was in college [sigh] 

50.51 51.64 B: yeah 

51.04 54.30 A: uh it makes it really easy for people to 

54.66 60.08 A: i don't know to plagiarize and not get caught you know i m- i- it's twof- twofold what do you think 

57.63 58.87 B: (( [mn] yeah yeah )) 

59.64 64.31 B: well it um i'm just the same age as you so i'm in the same boat i 

64.43 75.33 B: i kind of uh i wish i didn't have as many computers in school because one i'm a terrible speller and i'll never be a better speller because spell check because 

73.87 75.74 A: because you always use spell check [laughter] 

75.30 84.37 B: i spell check it you know and now i even have spell check on my email so it's like i don't even have to spell right correctly in my emails so it's like i never 

76.70 77.55 A: yeah 

83.44 90.95 A: it takes the place of all these normal everyday functions that that people wouldn't have taken for granted say thirty years ago 

86.38 87.68 B: exactly 

90.74 93.43 B: exactly you know like i feel 

93.50 94.84 B: like uh 

94.89 103.12 B: my communication skills as a whole have been disrupted by by being able to use computers from such a early age 

103.29 110.51 B: you know but at the same ti- i it you're right it's it's made everything easier you know which i don't know 

110.81 114.82 B: which i don't know if it's that's a good thing when you're growing up when you're at school 

114.94 116.82 A: yeah totally i a- 

116.22 117.14 B: (( you know um )) 

118.18 124.81 B: although i think it's a good i think it's a good thing to to use the commi- the research 

125.48 133.09 B: abilities of like the internet and the communication abilities of the internet you know i think those are good for ch- for kids 

133.33 140.92 A: [sigh] well that's great i guess they they uh teach computers much more now these these days in uh high school than they did when i was in high school uh [sigh] 

134.59 135.80 B: you know you 

138.08 139.22 B: (( know yeah )) 

140.66 143.02 B: oh yeah like 

141.51 149.36 A: and then from what i hear people can bring laptops in- into school and you know write directly into that you know in high school 

149.07 151.18 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

149.51 152.28 A: now it's kind of unheard of when i was in high school [sigh] 

152.39 156.42 B: well i went to a kind of pr- little progressive high school so mine was 

156.42 164.45 B: you know we could bring laptops and shit like that we didn't because yeah i wen- you know it was like a private school and we could do all that but uh 

158.71 159.83 A: really 

164.26 175.66 B: none of us really did 'cause none of us could type fast enough to take notes but we definitely like i would bring my laptop in and write on it if i had a paper due or some- something like that um but i mean i even knew kids 

175.66 185.53 B: i had i had kids coming to my school that came from like all computerized schools that like apple was funding and stuff like that and uh 

183.51 184.47 A: wow 

185.85 191.64 B: and i don't think they were smart either i felt like at that time i felt like they 

191.91 203.47 B: they had like a better understanding of of the internet and stuff and their their research was ten times better than uh mine was 'cause you know i was still researching in like a library you know while they 

202.00 205.07 A: right it's a much harder way to research things 

204.67 206.24 B: (( yeah you know )) 

205.25 206.09 A: but i 

206.12 209.00 A: you know have to wonder though if it's a little bit more fulfilling 

209.36 212.65 A: [sigh] um just in terms of of the effort you put in 

212.83 217.39 A: but but of course you have much more at at your hands if you're on the internet 

212.97 214.00 B: well i- 

216.95 227.93 B: yeah yeah that's uh that's the thing it's like do you want to in a in a like a learning experience do you want or learning environment do you want to work more towards 

228.07 235.83 B: the fulfilling aspect or the how much you can learn like i guess myself i would rather 

235.97 239.34 B: if if i you know i'd rather have access to 

239.41 253.42 B: a whole slew of of uh of you know documents if i was researching a paper than you know just a a selected few in in my high school library or my you know city library you know 

252.40 255.71 A: i mean it'd be great if they can kind of make a marriage of the two you know 

255.54 256.78 B: (( yeah mm )) 

255.88 262.18 A: um say in in a course where they're teaching computer technology and stuff like that and and using computer as resources 

262.02 276.79 A: they could they could also stress the importance of of using your own mind to assess the information and still come up with your own thoughts in your papers [sigh] you know because i think a lot of people run the risk of of just kind of divulging information they've read and putting it together 

270.32 271.91 B: yeah 

275.20 276.27 B: yeah 

276.68 282.56 A: [mn] you know maybe in different orders changing wording [sigh] it's really easy just to do that and uh 

277.21 278.64 B: yeah 

279.74 280.63 B: yeah 

281.71 283.36 B: (( plagiarize it yeah )) 

282.57 287.24 A: and then you don't really retain the information as well as if you were to take [sigh] 

287.12 299.44 A: say a few bits of information from here and there and then come up with something that may- maybe even comparable to something you might have read somewhere [sigh] but instead you've you've thought it up on your own [mn] and uh 

295.75 296.91 B: (( i see that )) 

298.57 305.47 B: now do you think do you think that that uh computers have made er i mean obviously computers have made that you 

305.64 310.17 B: know more accessible because all you gotta do is cut and paste but do you think [sigh] um 

310.36 320.45 B: the kids didn't do that when when you were at the library and you saw a good essay by somebody that you had to you know that you were using as a reference you know kids didn't 

319.82 326.36 A: it's much easier for a teacher to go in the library and check out you know maybe the ten or twelve books that are on that subject [sigh] 

320.78 321.43 B: (( kinda )) 

322.70 324.33 B: (( yeah i can see that )) 

325.99 327.13 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

326.54 327.93 A: you know it's 

328.48 329.66 A: there's no way 

328.60 334.37 B: but in a in a in a paper you do have to cite the websites that you use and all that kind of stuff 

333.75 336.14 A: yeah yeah you should 

335.20 337.66 B: but i guess that's not 

337.29 340.00 A: i i guess it all boils down to honesty then 

337.92 338.90 B: (( hm )) 

339.55 343.14 B: [mn] yeah you know and that's but i think uh 

342.82 344.26 A: integrity [noise] 

343.96 346.43 B: integrity i don't know if that's as uh 

346.54 349.42 B: uh i don't know you know it's since i've got 

349.33 363.63 B: you know been out of school it seems like it's kind of like on the downfall i mean even in my the the my high school that i went to had a huge honor code you know but even in the four years i was there it seemed like 

363.61 366.61 B: it just dwindled and dwindled you know 

367.15 371.39 B: i don't know that that's probably just me getting older i don't yeah it's tough 

367.17 367.93 A: mhm 

371.09 371.65 A: (( [mn] )) 

371.55 372.26 B: though 

372.14 374.95 A: i no i i think um 

375.31 379.73 A: i wasn't around in the fifties but but from what i've seen it seems like 

377.33 378.12 B: yeah 

379.88 381.86 A: honor and and uh 

382.21 394.50 A: and integrity and a- things like that in doing school work were maybe a little bit more upheld or or respected back then i i don't know if that's a r- reflection on pop culture or or just you know everything with 

383.85 384.67 B: yeah 

387.72 388.74 B: yeah 

388.84 389.72 B: mhm 

393.48 395.19 B: (( [mn] exactly )) 

394.65 399.77 A: just the easiness of everything you know [sigh] or t._v. television who knows 

399.32 403.65 B: yeah yeah yeah no i i agree with that 

400.85 410.76 A: i know uh i'm a musician uh so so um you know i i went to a music school actually for college and uh computers were really great in terms of of uh 

406.60 407.46 B: (( oh yeah )) 

411.15 415.36 A: [mn] you know just dealing with musical uh education you know and stuff like that 

413.75 414.76 B: of course 

414.85 419.48 B: yeah um i'm an actor so and i went to an acting college so i 

419.84 422.88 B: [mn] computers didn't really mean crap to me 

422.02 423.66 A: didn't mean much uh 

423.41 428.83 B: yeah you know it was like i'd i still had to write a lot of papers and stuff like that it was a liberal education but 

429.01 437.01 B: you know there wasn't wasn't too much uh wasn't too much use nowadays i i'm sitting on my computer twenty four hours a day but 

436.83 441.66 A: you can learn a lot right just surfing the internet checking out things [sigh] 

438.06 445.62 B: yeah exactly yeah you can you pro- did you get this through craig's list 

442.54 443.69 A: i 

445.50 446.66 A: yeah 

446.23 447.54 B: (( yeah so did i )) 

447.43 449.70 A: yeah you can find anything through the computers 

447.59 448.27 B: yeah 

448.67 450.28 B: you can find anything out though 

450.48 456.31 B: you know and that's that's why i like it so much now because it's it's a massive learning tool for myself 

451.09 451.97 A: i guess 

456.33 457.53 B: you know like 

456.34 458.98 A: i i think it's the best learning tool when 

459.67 460.59 A: you there 

460.41 461.65 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

461.04 463.26 A: oh thought they'd cut us off 

462.10 464.97 B: (( i know i thought they were going to cut us off like )) 

464.20 467.22 A: it's like the best learning tool as long as you're 

467.39 470.21 A: you're not forced to use it you know [sigh] 

469.67 470.81 B: yeah 

470.24 472.28 A: for me it uh 

471.30 473.80 B: i could see that yeah 

473.13 474.60 A: it's like endless 

474.64 477.24 B: yeah yeah 

475.16 480.79 A: pop something in google and then you learn something new e- every time 

479.88 487.87 B: [sigh] now what do you think the the do they use stuff like the v. chip in in schools and computers or can can kids go anywhere 

487.94 489.67 A: the v. chip what is that 

489.09 494.99 B: uh the like censoring do they censor where kids are allowed to go on websites 

495.31 497.04 A: oh in schools 

496.09 498.38 B: (( like in schools yeah )) 

497.83 501.20 A: i bet they do but i haven't been in schools for so long you know 

500.10 511.13 B: oh they do yeah i know i haven't either but that'll be an interesting thing for me because it's like you're allowing them accessibility to anything it seems almost and it's like where 

511.24 514.71 B: where does it where do you draw the line at um 

515.13 516.46 B: what what d- 

515.35 517.56 A: i guess that another downfall you know 

517.30 518.65 B: yeah 

517.99 522.53 A: um but i i guess schools and stuff they put up firewalls which uh 

522.36 524.12 B: (( they'd have to or something )) 

523.52 530.55 A: yeah which prevent um you know accessing you know of course like porn sites and stuff like that [sigh] 

528.11 529.57 B: certain things 

530.22 537.05 B: well i could see i could understand porn but what about when you get into political beliefs religious beliefs 

536.72 538.03 A: oh like heavy 

537.15 540.99 B: you know th- yeah like right wing left wing stuff where do you 

541.15 544.99 B: where do you where do you draw the line there that's my question it's like 

543.86 548.70 A: well freedom of speech i i guess doesn't have any uh limits in terms of age so [lipsmack] 

548.37 550.10 B: (( yeah but you know )) 

549.10 552.53 A: but i get huh it's open to all 

551.87 563.01 B: [mn] i know but uh that's what i wonder i wonder if there have been any i don't know i haven't researched this at all but has there been any research you know that's something to [mn] something to think about i'm going to write that down because i 

557.31 558.98 A: yeah that would be interesting 

563.10 566.02 B: but yeah uh no that's something to think about sure [noise] 

566.19 569.27 B: schools do schools 'cause i remember when i was in school 

569.69 581.87 B: you know everyth- i went through you know a private school and everything was censored you know but that was because it was a private school and they were allowed to do that but when we're talking public schools where's the line 

581.91 584.92 B: y- i have no idea you know so 

584.73 595.81 A: now i wonder some day if computers are going to take over the education system in such a way that kids won't even have to go to school any more they'll just sit home on the computers in an interactive kind of learning setting [sigh] 

595.93 599.90 B: i you know i was thinking about that a lot lately 'cause you see those ads all over the place
