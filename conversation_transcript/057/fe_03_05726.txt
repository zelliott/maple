37.24 39.35 B: about hundred [laughter] 

38.59 50.10 A: that's horrible but er a threat to our country huh i would guess er [sigh] the middle east er area and er probably north korea would be ah 

39.65 40.66 B: (( yeah )) 

42.41 43.22 B: mm 

48.91 52.88 B: oh is it well my guess was it could be china 

52.72 54.13 A: china huh 

53.61 54.92 B: yeah 

54.39 58.64 A: well yeah yeah that's that's a possibility but north korea has the er 

58.86 61.67 A: nuclear er capabilities 

62.00 74.18 B: ah but i don't really really i mean they don't have much much of a power and er you know a whole international kind of strength to threat er i mean to threat the u._s. 

74.13 85.61 B: that's not er i don't think north korea would be anywhere capable of doing that but china china is emerging as ah i mean very close super power to next to 

79.05 81.03 A: [noise] yeah yeah 

85.81 87.11 B: next to u._s. 

87.15 95.11 A: yeah if they can get their act together they could be a [noise] viable threat but right now they're too busy worrying about hong kong and er 

94.75 98.09 B: (( [laughter] yeah yeah they're a vast threat yeah )) 

95.36 96.91 A: and how to control 

97.45 110.93 A: yeah so they they're trying to get their act together but once they do and they focus on us then that could be a problem but as of right now i i don't see any threat [noise] coming from china so er 

105.35 106.23 B: (( yeah )) 

110.14 115.50 B: yeah but the m- yeah the middle east as a whole i don't think er 

110.78 112.90 A: the only thing i'm [noise] [noise] [noise] 

115.56 130.46 B: i mean er the country as a whole can er be any threat but some of the smaller groups like the terrorists organizations could could certainly be a threat for the u._s. security but not er i don't think the countries ah as a whole 

130.48 134.05 B: they they would participate in such a thing 

133.99 139.89 A: [sigh] yeah you don't think er [sigh] the sentiment over there is er pretty anti u._s. right now 

138.86 142.70 B: yeah yeah right yeah it is yes it is 

140.74 141.63 A: no 

142.51 154.78 A: it is a little bit right yeah see that's that's the only thing [sigh] i'm concerned about if they can get their hands on those biological weapons you know i'd be a little concerned about that

147.04 148.64 B: yeah 

151.71 152.72 B: (( [noise] uh-huh ))

155.63 159.94 A: but um [noise] hey you gotta keep on living life [noise] [noise] 

156.99 169.02 B: but er i mean for those kind of things that ah i think the u._s. intelligence is quite capable of er countering those things and detecting those pretty early and then taking appropriate action 

168.87 180.10 B: but then the these guerrilla groups like the you know al qaeda and all those groups you don't ever really know [mn] what they're up to and what they're d- gonna do next 

179.95 180.88 A: right 

180.13 185.72 B: so i think those groups might be a security threat but not the governments and all that you know 

182.36 183.46 A: [noise]
