0.00 1.23 B: hello 

0.78 2.24 A: yes hi 

1.83 5.52 B: [noise] hi my name's ken i'm in uh jersey city new jersey 

5.21 8.68 A: hi ken i'm david and i'm in manhattan not 

8.10 8.97 B: oh 

9.07 10.56 B: practically neighbors 

10.08 15.48 A: exactly not so far away as opposed to most of the other people i've spoken with [sigh] 

10.92 11.80 B: [laughter] 

12.83 13.72 B: uh 

16.31 19.22 A: is this your third call second call first call 

18.70 20.24 B: it's my third call 

20.12 23.50 A: as is mine i wonder if they've done that to us on purpose 

23.22 27.77 B: i don't know they're that clever but who knows it's all computerized [laughter] 

26.92 37.55 A: i i almost think they are because uh i got the impression that my first call was with a person on their first call the second call was with a person on their second call 

36.94 37.75 B: mm 

37.81 40.90 A: and they had the same topics as i did as well 

41.25 42.69 B: (( oh that's interesting [sigh] [mn] [mn] )) 

42.09 45.82 A: yeah i didn't do a call yesterday so i'm wondering i don't 

46.67 52.89 A: it's odd in any event so the topic of the day is computers and education and whether they improve or uh 

53.41 54.88 A: or not 

53.96 62.93 B: yeah and that seems like a a really old fashioned question [laughter] i mean these days where everything is computerized i mean how could it be anything but helpful 

62.55 67.44 A: i think it's helpful as well though i do think it might be possible for 

67.52 68.72 A: um 

68.77 72.17 A: well like to get in c- it makes it a lot easier to plagiarize 

72.64 74.14 A: and but then i 

73.22 74.72 B: oh you mean the internet 

74.48 83.92 A: yeah yeah exactly i think if anything it's a lot easier to [sigh] accumulate information but then i would also think that it'd be easier to [sigh] um 

83.99 88.25 A: perhaps catch people plagiarizing as well 'cause you could do 

87.15 94.08 B: yeah my experience in grad school which was fairly recently was anybody who plagiarized t- tended to get caught 

93.95 103.70 B: no matter where they got the information from um i was able to do some amazing research um using the internet and also using lexis nexis 

95.88 96.98 A: mhm 

103.78 104.75 A: right 

103.88 110.76 B: which they had at the school which gave me access to just all kinds of information i wouldn't have have had otherwise 

110.41 116.19 A: lexis nexis is primarily for legal stuff or is or am i wrong and that's when i 

114.42 125.74 B: um i think it started out that way but it's basically just a huge database of newspapers and special and magazines and er uh trade publications from all over the world 

125.77 128.80 A: but you need to be a subscriber in order to access it 

128.15 136.80 B: yeah yeah my school was a subscriber so i was able to use it and the last company i worked for also had it and um 

130.73 131.78 A: right 

135.23 136.23 A: uh-huh 

136.70 148.56 B: it was a a big consulting firm and any time we started a job and i had to research this industry i could just do a lexis nexis search and you know bring up about twenty articles printed recently be right up to date 

146.38 148.14 A: right 

148.50 156.58 A: with the internet i guess it's too easy to get a lot of hits that are not um specific to your topic it's it's 

156.59 161.42 B: [sigh] yeah that's the problem with lexis nexis if you're too vague you could get like twenty five thousand hits so 

156.71 157.57 A: it's just 

161.16 162.41 A: right [sigh] h- 

161.62 175.62 B: you have to you have to kn- know how to you know use the uh boolean logic to pose the question [sigh] i'm wondering when ask this the question that they gave us if they're thinking of [mn] uh using computers like in high school and grade school 

174.98 186.24 A: oh i'm sure they are i'm sure that they're thinking of all different levels when i was i mean i don't know how old you are i'm i was born in sixty five so i'm thirty eight now when i was in grade school there was [sigh] 

187.08 189.74 A: really they had um 

189.75 195.22 A: like in a primary school there was a computer that was called system eighty 

195.30 200.34 A: and basically it was it was not a real computer but there were um 

201.21 203.72 A: (( [lipsmack] there were programs )) 

204.13 206.78 A: (( that you could [mn] )) 

206.81 214.85 A: they were they were learning programs basically so you could listen and see and then press a button to respond to questions 

214.60 215.42 B: (( mm )) 

214.95 228.31 A: but it wasn't very interactive and it was more i think for for children that had um perhaps some problems uh with the materials and it was just a different avenue for them to use 

227.81 234.77 B: [sigh] yeah i i think some of that stuff can get pretty boring i like don't like computer games i find them really monotonous 

234.36 235.33 A: uh-huh 

234.63 247.41 B: and uh when i was in high school i wrote a computer program for i was an educational thing about for elementary school kids about learning world capitals so it would give a country and it would give a multiple choice question [sigh] 

247.38 252.89 B: and you got two guesses and then you know if you got it right you got to move on to the next one that sort of thing but um 

252.19 261.01 A: [sigh] i would think for repetitive things where it's memorization the computer would be really a useful tool 'cause basically they put it up with a map i would i'm sure 

261.17 265.60 A: and and you could just choose and it would reinforce it that way 

265.30 277.08 B: yeah um but i think it would be important to teach uh you know high school kids especially how to use um you know some of the microsoft programs 'cause when you get out in the business world 

276.88 289.55 B: they're everywhere and you know it's and even in college to know how to uh to use an excel spreadsheet know how to use uh the word program it's just it's it's necessary it's as important as learning anything else these days 

277.87 278.96 A: right 

284.84 286.25 A: mhm 

289.28 293.48 A: well i think i think the kids are learning it faster and faster i mean 

293.77 308.49 A: [sigh] one of the er children of um the principal of one of the companies i was at i mean his kids who were like ten twelve thirteen years old they knew much more about the computer than the father did it's always that way the younger generation's always going to 

308.58 316.93 A: assimilate the information faster and and is going to learn it quicker and um i i just 

310.80 312.03 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

316.85 324.54 A: i think those of us that didn't grow up with the computer er we're lagging a little bit unless it becomes your profession 

324.68 336.26 A: uh uh over the children that are growing up with it and have it available to them now i mean every home oh not every home but many homes i think already have at least one uh computer sitting in somewhere in the house 

335.44 342.52 B: [mn] yeah yeah i think they're becoming as predominant as toasters you know as [laughter] basic household appliances 

340.65 353.78 A: yeah and dell's making them cheaper and cheaper i mean there are other manufacturers as well but i mean you get [mn] a very decent system i think a desktop for five hundred seven hundred dollars something like that i mean 

353.77 359.72 B: yeah i i saw a statistic recently that i think sixty percent of the households in in the united states 

359.94 361.75 B: have computers 

361.80 368.05 B: at home and i don't know but there's a lot much larger number that has people who have access to a computer 

368.20 369.24 A: mhm 

368.29 372.22 B: so if they don't w- you know have one in their home they they access it at work 

371.97 377.30 A: right yeah i know a lot of people that i mean i only bothered with a computer at home 

377.42 388.92 A: in the last year because i'd left a job i quit and you know while i'm working at home and doing my own thing as opposed to working for someone else it becomes a necessity i mean you're cut off without a computer 

384.64 385.65 B: mhm 

388.36 390.59 B: oh yeah yeah especially with the 

389.20 391.13 A: so much is done through email 

390.73 392.26 B: (( with the internet [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

391.63 396.02 A: yes and so much is done through email and um i mean 

396.51 402.36 A: [mn] five six seven years ago i had friends who it was an extended group of people that played ball 

402.22 411.75 A: and primarily the the mode by which everybody was informed as to what was going on was through email distribution lists and if you didn't have a computer 

411.70 413.18 B: you were left out 

411.71 421.76 A: you had to hope that you had to hope that somebody who was on it was keeping you informed and making those telephone calls to you 'cause everybody else had it you know [mn] uh when it went out on computer 

421.41 426.77 B: yeah i um had experience i lost uh a job due to september eleventh 

426.78 429.99 B: and got involved in this uh training program 

426.82 427.44 A: (( mm )) 

430.00 444.25 B: and al- and although i have a graduate school degree and wasn't doing the computer training [sigh] a big emphasis of the training program that was set up was to take people who were working some of the more menial jobs and give them computer training so they could go out and get a higher paying job 

443.90 444.86 A: right 

444.59 456.79 B: so you know back to the to the question it just seems to make sense that you you would want to teach everybody in elementary and high schools uh as much about the computer as possible 

456.46 457.74 A: right 

457.12 458.05 B: but 

458.05 471.09 B: i i i i guess i don't know back to the same question i don't know if they're refering to learning via computers instead of the uh teacher or teaching how to use the computer it's not it's not clear to me 'cause i'm not in favor of learning 

468.38 469.62 A: right 

470.96 474.31 B: through a computer rather than a teacher like a you know 

474.01 482.89 A: i think it's good to supplement but i think you can't do everything in uh isolated from human contact i mean it just doesn't work 

482.19 486.51 B: yeah yeah and there's no way to monitor somebody's understanding something or not i mean there's 

485.91 491.28 A: no you can you can test them do you ever hear that that urban legend about um 

491.99 495.23 A: i i guess i think it was entitled tomatoes 

495.70 500.10 A: ever hear a st- a story urban legend about tomatoes 

499.18 501.50 B: um i don't know i'm not sure [laughter] 

500.16 506.88 A: it's computer related so if you want i i'll share it with you we'll kill a couple of minutes because i think we've got more time to kill 

504.32 505.59 B: (( okay )) 

507.07 508.28 A: the uh 

509.31 513.35 A: a guy goes into microsoft looking for a job and they said 

513.70 521.97 A: take this aptitude test and we'll let you know what kind of positions here you're qualified for so he takes the test and they call him back in they uh 

522.14 524.20 A: they tell him that um 

524.32 533.82 A: they've analyzed his uh his exam and he's qualified to be a janitor and pay's five dollars an hour and um 

534.16 546.93 A: they ask him for his email address 'cause all the scheduling and monitoring of work is done through computers and he said i don't have one and they said well you know this is microsoft this is what we do if you don't have a computer we really can't help you 

547.08 560.06 A: so the guy goes home all dejected and doesn't know what to do and on his way home he passes like a a wholesaler for tomatoes and buys a crate of tomatoes and he goes on the sidewalk he buys the crate for ten bucks he sells 

560.23 564.23 A: tomatoes individually and comes back with twenty dollars 

564.24 571.05 A: goes back to the wholesaler and keeps on buying crates and he says you know this isn't so bad i'm making much more money than i would at microsoft 

571.64 578.29 A: slowly he builds his business so then he buys a hand truck and he's buying ten cases at a time and he's 

578.55 589.71 A: l- lots of turnover and he slowly builds his business and he's gotta get he rents a van and he starts buying a van load of tomatoes and it just multiplying it and he 

590.05 596.97 A: all of a sudden he's got a fleet of vans and he's employing guys on different corners and they're all selling produce and he's making a fortune 

597.39 599.95 A: and it just snowballs
