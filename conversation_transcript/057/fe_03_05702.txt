1.86 3.43 A: hi i'm william 

3.58 5.29 B: hi william how ya doing today 

4.88 6.60 A: good 

6.82 8.86 A: so you've got the topic of the day 

8.33 10.22 B: yep got it 

10.08 12.67 A: oh okay what do you think 

12.53 20.78 B: okay as far as threats to the u._s. um i think north korea's the one ah the one big threat to the u._s. right now 

21.07 22.51 B: ah because 

21.32 22.44 A: um 

22.71 31.36 B: you've got a leadership there that just is ah that they're so inconsistent ah you know it's not even funny they just they don't they don't have a clue 

31.44 32.48 B: ah 

32.58 35.25 B: they have nothing to lose because the country's poor 

35.26 48.32 B: the country's you know impoverished it's been that way for a long time they've got a lot of sour grapes against again- basically against the united states about the korean war so as far as i'm concerned they have a chance i think they're going to try to do something 

47.90 61.90 A: oh i agree with you that korea north korea represents the largest ah to this country not only to the sovereignty of north south korea but also to all of asia including japan 

51.02 52.71 B: right 

62.04 71.73 A: and i think that um i think unless that we [cough] we create better relationships with china that kind of does the check and balance against north korea 

62.06 64.22 B: absolutely 

71.71 72.65 B: right 

71.85 78.51 A: we're not going to get anywhere i think if ah we cannot alienate china but then we run into problems with the taiwan issue 

78.74 88.77 A: ah you know do we support taiwan then alienate china china supports north korea does it help us with the threat to south korea and the rest of asia um 

88.81 97.67 A: you know it's it's a very difficult situation but i think also we [cough] we have to start looking at our our foreign policy 

91.52 93.34 B: right 

97.72 99.70 A: on a more [mn] 

99.86 105.44 A: reasonable way of ah not to represent a threat to countries 

105.78 111.86 A: that we're going to go ruin like the government we've got to go and change it as we've done in iran and and afghanistan 

111.99 116.88 A: um which i don't know whether that was the best or worst thing to do 

117.11 118.40 A: right now though 

117.24 119.15 B: well i don't 

118.83 119.76 A: yes 

119.69 133.36 B: i don't think it works er all that well especially with um when you talk about asia because asia's a whole different culture ah they're very steeped in tradition they're very ah they're very ancient culture ah they 

133.48 140.13 B: um they're starting to take to modern ways but they still have a lot of ancient ways which they will not change 

140.08 152.85 B: and you know you're trying to talk about you know basically ah ancient ways in a modern society well the united states really doesn't have any ancient ways i mean the united states is only three hundred years old 

148.91 149.73 A: no 

151.81 157.29 A: you're right and we're maybe considered ah to them we're considered a little bit still 

157.45 158.58 A: (( ah )) 

158.70 160.85 A: not advanced 

160.53 161.70 B: right 

160.86 165.10 A: in in many ways and the other thing is that we're looking at 

165.27 173.88 A: [mn] at china and we're er china right now is is the one of the largest reasons for our trade imbalance 

173.94 175.05 B: right 

174.40 182.92 A: and you know we look at the threats that we have now let's look at outside of military threats economic threats 

183.51 187.70 A: you know the economic threat posed by china is also great 

187.87 190.00 B: right because china is 

188.42 189.52 A: ah that 

190.07 193.00 B: china has the largest population in the world 

190.26 191.26 A: huge 

192.27 195.33 A: huge labor pool ah cheap labor 

194.19 195.04 B: (( exactly )) 

195.74 198.12 A: how scary is that you know 

198.28 199.72 B: right 

198.87 204.24 A: you know marketing companies are are are not as loyal as they were to a worker many years ago 

204.33 208.38 A: but then again we were more insular back in the thirties forties and fifties 

206.54 207.57 B: right 

208.40 222.18 A: so we're we're we're looking at threats foreign foreign threats to this country being basically north korea from me and and china ah i think the middle east doesn't represent a threat per se but it represents 

222.08 235.42 A: a a level of of threat where people are more ah inclined to harm us physically in this country but but north korea has got to be the worst threat that we have we've had that for for years now 

230.33 231.25 B: right 

235.74 241.26 A: and we we definitely have to play a more diplomatic game with them than we have with the middle east 

241.23 242.46 B: right and we have 

242.94 247.41 B: we have to utilize our allies as well we have to utilize japan 

246.73 247.30 A: (( [cough] )) 

247.19 258.02 B: in this we have to utilize south korea ah even though i know south korean military are um you know disagree with each other ah i think the leaders of those two countries believe that 

257.79 268.87 B: um that they have to have a mutual i guess a mutual acceptance of each other or else neither country is going to survive and the united states has to utilize ah those 

263.09 263.95 A: right 

268.74 270.37 B: i guess those feelings 

270.20 282.33 B: ah because if they don't utilize them then they're going to stir up a whole pot because 'cause there's too many fragments in asia right now there's too many countries that are that are steeped in their own tradition and have their own style of government 

282.17 290.61 B: ah you know and and they don't wanna they don't wanna cooperate with each other let alone you know the united states it's almost like 

288.20 289.86 A: right i think that they 

289.77 290.60 A: they 

290.39 305.06 A: the asians will cooperate with each other much more readily than they would if the united states starts imposing its will in the in asia and i think that's that's the reason of reason that we should not try to alienate them but try to work more on a 

299.76 300.60 B: right 

305.03 309.13 A: on a quiet diplo- diplomacy matter way that we can 

309.31 315.64 A: push these countries to dialogue as long as dialogue is happening the threat is minimized 

315.56 319.93 B: right exactly right because um the thing is ah you know as as 

316.22 317.08 A: yeah 

320.04 329.86 B: everyone knows if if you can talk and communicate you know and communicate in a civil manner and it doesn't necessarily mean you have to agree on everything it just means that you have to 

327.73 328.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

329.76 342.25 B: ah basically accept and you know and and try to work within the parameters that each country has set for themselves and the united states really has to take the position of of almost being 

342.12 346.61 B: on the outside looking in it kinda have to re- you know rely on 

346.50 359.98 B: the their asian allies to help in their dealings with their asian i i don't wanna use the word enemies but ah you know but their asian detractors i guess wou- would be a better way um because 

359.36 360.64 A: (( [mn] of the taiwan )) 

362.09 370.32 A: ah support them in in throughout third parties but not support them directly so we don't alienate china and alien and china will help us 

370.41 372.55 B: exactly right because 

371.49 372.52 A: china will 

373.08 385.82 B: right because there's still there's still a problem with um with with that china and taiwan and you still have the problem of hong kong where ah you know where there's there's still tension between hong kong and britain even though they've just 

385.94 390.51 B: ah hang on recently decreed as a as a british province 

390.58 402.50 B: ah there's still there's still problems there as well and as long as these countries realize that united states and britain are entire- are are best allies there's still going to be animosity towards the united states even though it's not a direct animosity 

402.86 407.56 B: you know there's still going to be some form of animosity there
