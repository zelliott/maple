58.23 70.60 A: okay uh so y- y- you know w- w- we have kids as young as sixteen years old coming in and taking um you know uh like like microsoft courses in order to become system engineers 

69.88 71.34 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

70.67 73.31 A: um you know when i was going to school

76.46 77.79 B: (( [noise] right )) 

77.12 78.79 A: [laughter] so 

78.00 79.81 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

78.94 86.43 A: s- s- so i mean you know a- as far as job market goes i- i- it certainly is something that's very beneficial 

86.00 92.69 B: well i mean obviously you have to look for people that know a little bit of computer if you're you know trying to fill positions 

92.66 98.33 A: oh sure i mean i mean e- e- e- even like a cashier at a grocery store you know everything's so automated now 

93.58 94.22 B: (( 'cause [mn] )) 

98.10 107.78 A: and computerized that you know i- i- if they don't know what what uh what's going on in in the computer field or or have some type of education with computers 

108.00 110.91 A: they're you know they they they really lose out a lot 

110.61 113.55 B: [mn] yeah i would suspect so [mn] 

114.08 122.22 B: we've got the same thing i mean if you know they don't if they come to us without some computer skills they're lost in the education field i mean 

122.59 124.79 B: (( [sigh] they can't keep up i mean [laughter] mm )) 

124.45 127.37 A: oh yeah i mean i i i mean i mean and you know

131.78 146.35 A: uh they they give you websites to go look up now in order to do your homework er where- whereas you know instead of telling you okay well you need to go to the library and check this th- this site out well uh now now it's okay well you need to go to this website and read up on this 

146.81 155.27 A: so uh you know y- y- you h- you have to know [mn] h- how to use a computer in order to to even do some of your homework in in university and college settings 

155.33 164.86 B: right so you know it's i don't see how you can get out of it [laughter] like you know there are there are obviously problems with it all i mean like in 

160.19 161.47 A: (( no no )) 

165.42 172.79 B: uh i have 'em they can't add or subtract anything in their head i mean they're so used to computers and calculators that 

171.76 181.87 A: e- e- e- e- exactly i mean i mean you know y- y- y- you go you go to your accessories button and pull up the calculator on the computer t- t- to even add and subtract numbers [laughter] so 

173.04 174.01 B: [laughter] 

180.66 182.31 B: (( [noise] right )) 

182.03 186.20 A: what's uh wh- wh- what's an add estimate not a good thing

186.69 188.01 A: (( [mn] e- e- )) 

186.88 200.63 B: right yeah and you also s- you know there's s- a dependency in there that's a little a little frightening in some ways but i mean s- i don't you know you seems like you've got to go one way or another you know you have to there's no real 

201.82 206.93 B: [sigh] partial ground here i mean you can't say well let's see i'm semi computer literate or 

207.66 213.10 A: e- exactly i mean i mean you know uh d- depending on you know er er 

213.24 223.57 A: like in a career field depending on what you're looking for um you know most of the time y- you have to have some type of computer skill in order to even apply for that position any more 

222.60 231.91 B: [laughter] right [mn] you know i can't go without one i mean it's there's just no way i could handle all the stuff i'm expected to handle daily just [sigh] [laughter] 

232.32 237.74 A: [laughter] yeah uh i i i mean i mean i i myself you know have uh 

237.52 248.12 A: six children [laughter] uh and and the oldest is eleven and he just graduated to fifth grade and he's getting ready to go into the sixth grade next year 

238.89 240.21 B: (( [mn] wow )) 

247.88 255.14 A: and i mean even in the fifth grade they were sending stuff home uh for him to look up online uh with web addresses and stuff 

255.74 264.71 A: so i i i mean if they're already doing that in in elementary school uh you know i i can only imagine er what what it's going to be like later on 

266.98 270.58 A: and and i think it i think it's a lot nicer 

268.16 269.02 B: (( [noise] thank you )) 

271.20 277.73 A: um you know ha- having thing like you know having things like word to where they can go in and type up their reports 

277.34 283.04 B: [sigh] oh well i had to do it the old [mn] fashioned way believe me cut and paste is wonderful [laughter] 

280.96 291.94 A: [laughter] e- e- e- e- exactly because it's much easier to hit that backspace than it is to er try try to line up that keystroke on the typewriter [laughter] 

290.24 293.16 B: or start it all over again which was uh [mn] 

292.56 298.79 A: exactly y- y- you're you're like you're like half way through the report and uh and you get that typo in there 

298.65 301.19 B: [noise] yeah i've blessed 

301.61 308.13 B: [mn] word publisher you know the word processor you know it's probably the biggest thing in 

304.72 306.04 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

309.22 322.38 B: [mn] in my favor anyway i mean just all the times when i really would have been messed up if i'd had to start all over again or you know you come in and you've got the same same general report to do but you know these things have changed and [sigh] [laughter] 

323.14 324.51 A: exactly 

324.52 331.18 A: uh yeah yeah i mean w- one of the things that i that i use a lot er that that i just er you know i don't think i could get along without is 

331.19 345.56 A: is like microsoft excel um er because i do a lot of spreadsheets you know k- k- keeping track of of you know individuals' names and stuff like that and i and i think without having that knowledge you know 

332.85 333.88 B: mhm 

336.14 337.37 B: oh yeah 

345.38 353.26 A: uh uh to me i i'd be at a loss i'd have to keep paper records and uh a- and i'd have paper sitting all over my desk 

352.39 358.96 B: [mn] well i've got that anyway but [laughter] i still have to use spreadsheets for sure [laughter] mhm 

354.45 356.58 A: [laughter] 

358.73 365.01 A: oh yeah i mean i mean [sigh] i- i- it- it's just amazing and er and the knowledge that kids nowadays 

364.78 377.86 A: have uh you know li- li- like i say mo- uh a- all of my children are you know elementary age or or younger and uh you know they they they know a- almost as much about computers as i do [laughter] 

377.87 391.35 A: a- a- and i'm like and i'm like you know they teach you all of that in school and they're like yeah you know a- a- and and i think it's i i think it's good on on one hand but on the other hand you know uh i think it allows them to grow up a little too quickly 

391.24 400.28 B: yeah well also i also worry about you know the fact they just they can't add one plus one in their head too i mean that's a little little scary [laughter] 

391.95 392.97 A: (( [sigh] so )) 

397.16 410.26 A: e- e- exactly i mean i mean and uh y- y- you know uh uh gr- growing up w- we had to learn the multiplication table and you know th- th- the kids nowadays uh uh re- rely on their calculator 

400.43 401.00 B: (( [mn] )) 

410.03 420.35 A: [noise] uh er way too much uh you know uh b- because a lot of 'em er eh they can do the multiplication in their head er but it takes them a lot longer to do so 

420.83 425.22 B: yeah i know you also got the instant gratification factor that you know 

425.75 429.45 B: most of 'em don't want to pursue things that are you know aren't 

429.72 434.78 B: is- isn't all laid out for 'em you know it isn't all there it doesn't happen immediately it's uh 

435.79 447.45 B: i see that a lot with you know we we do a lot of engineering and project work and all that and all you know these kids come in and they expect everything to happen almost immediately you know instant gratification and 

446.54 455.49 A: [noise] [noise] oh yeah yeah yeah i mean i mean nowadays with computers and computer games and everything [noise] you know it it it's all right there 

455.65 470.58 A: a- i i i mean i mean our k- our uh unfortunately i hate to say it but our kids you know they don't go outside and and and play like we used to growing up i [laughter] you know they they'd they'd rather be in their uh you know playing their video games and stuff 

463.15 464.96 B: (( [mn] right )) 

470.39 482.56 A: you know which uh which is all computer related so you know in a way while computers are great because they'll allow you to do your job more efficiently and quicker um they've also made us lazy [laughter] 

481.87 483.58 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

483.59 485.19 B: (( uh [mn] i've )) 

485.28 493.92 B: worked with orthopedics a lot and you know they're seeing children coming in with problems you used to see in eighty year old people you know with the bones being 

486.72 487.28 A: (( [noise] )) 

494.36 497.27 B: just not worth much of anything and there's 

497.15 500.69 B: there's a lot of worry that you know this 

500.52 515.20 B: these kids aren't going out and you know stressing the bones and [mn] playing hard and doing uh things you know we used to take for granted when we were young and and that's a lot of them are just you know never stress the bones they never had to develop they way they 

515.15 521.74 B: need to do and so a lot of them are going to have a lot of osteo p- problems later on in life 

521.40 524.72 A: oh y- oh yeah and and well not only that but since 

524.55 537.03 A: since most of 'em learn to type and do keyboarding skills so early uh a- a- you know there there there's that increase in carpal tunnel syndrome the where uh they even have problems j- just using their hands for every day to day 

541.08 545.89 B: right hm so we're kind of running around there's good and bad but [laughter] it's kind of a two sided [mn] 

541.82 545.17 A: (( things )) 

545.19 557.73 A: [mn] y- y- yeah and i i i mean i mean there's good things and bad things about having computers i- i- in the school system uh y- you know o- o- obviously er you know th- th- unfortunately that's the way technology is moving 

557.73 560.92 A: and you know if you don't know something about computers 

560.78 568.79 A: uh you better get out there and learn it if you i- if you want to make any money um you know o- o- otherwise you're going to be in 

568.59 580.71 A: i- i- in one of these blue collar jobs uh and and and unfortunately in today's economy it it's harder it gets harder and harder to support a family uh you know just having a blue collar job 

570.98 572.61 B: right 

580.06 581.61 B: right 

581.19 583.90 A: so you know in that respect you know 

583.70 596.68 A: kn- kn- knowing about computers and being taught in the school system i- is great because then it gives you an advantage over those that haven't learned um but at the same time you know it a- a- again there it makes you lazy [laughter] [noise] 

596.52 597.69 B: (( yeah well )) 

598.48 599.95 B: kind of a double sworded
