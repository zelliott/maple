0.63 1.93 B: [noise] hello 

1.86 4.02 A: [noise] hi i'm i'm john 

4.43 6.21 B: um i'm i'm bryce 

6.17 10.36 A: nice to meet you so we're supposed to talk about computers and education 

6.57 8.79 B: (( [noise] i suppose )) 

10.29 13.82 B: yeah um did you want to go first or 

14.24 15.66 A: (( [mn] i've er )) 

16.35 18.17 A: sure why not 

17.14 18.94 B: (( [noise] [noise] okay [laughter] )) 

18.30 19.83 A: (( uh-hum )) 

19.96 22.25 A: i i i personally 

22.92 27.69 A: you know i came through the private school system so i was lucky enough to have er 

27.74 36.31 A: computers in my classroom and i think it really greatly enhanced my my educational experience because um 

36.46 39.27 A: you know i could able i was able to do 

39.29 47.93 A: you know do research over the internet while simultaneously being in in a classroom setting and i think that really improved my my educational experience 

50.67 61.53 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] okay um [cough] i would have to say that i went through a public school system and my dad actually works for the school district that i i went through and um 

62.25 71.55 B: seeing that education is a big role in our family i would have to say though that overall i think that computers have probably 

71.68 73.46 B: um not 

73.62 76.17 B: benefited education 

76.21 87.72 B: as much as they have helped it now the information is more readily available to students and teachers and um in that way i think that computers have helped 

87.88 89.00 B: um 

89.12 91.93 B: the classrooms and have helped 

92.28 93.93 B: (( you you know students )) 

94.10 103.11 B: learn a lot more today um and a lot easier however um and i'm just as guilt as doing this myself [laughter] um 

101.84 102.66 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

104.41 107.64 B: when it comes to term papers thesis 

107.60 121.71 B: um speeches and what not um it became a lot easier to write those papers using the internet than it would back in the day when all you had to use were books or um 

121.65 124.63 B: you know other resources that were available 

124.55 125.51 A: right 

124.89 130.25 B: um and and a grade with a lot more earned those days 

130.12 140.79 B: than they are now when you have a computer available because all you have to do is just go onto the computer search for something and you know you one website can do a whole paper for you 

140.80 147.90 B: you know and and other than teach yourself that also takes a big relief off of you because 

147.77 157.70 B: you know you have your homework done you have your grades and you know nobody ever knows that you know you put two cents into this paper 

156.89 160.13 A: [sigh] [sigh] right you can buy papers off the internet 

159.53 164.16 B: right you can buy them but a lot of times i didn't even you know you don't even have to purchase them 

163.93 168.86 B: you know th- i remember i remember doing one report on a book that i didn't even read 

168.62 180.19 B: and i got up there and you know just went on and on about the author and about this book and the teacher was so dumbfounded about how much i knew about the book and and what specifics went on 

180.32 187.41 B: and i actually got so [laughter] interested in the book after doing my report that i read the book after the report was due 

187.68 189.77 B: and and i mean 

190.37 196.94 B: [noise] i was able to do so well on that report because of the internet i was able to get on the internet and find what i needed to do 

197.13 200.50 B: um just because i hate to read so [laughter] 

200.11 201.97 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

202.20 203.25 B: um 

204.28 211.11 A: but i think that there there's a real plus too in terms of using the internet that 

211.14 221.44 A: small obscure topics you c- you can research them you know if you wanted to find out about you know nineteen twenty you know gender roles and nineteen twenties films you 

221.29 228.62 A: you can do that in and not have to you know be traveling all over the world you know all over that country to get those books 

228.21 233.58 B: and and that is true um that is that is very true because um 

233.78 245.50 B: you know especially in in the populated towns where you may not even have a public library you have the internet available to you or you have the ability to have the internet available to you 

242.67 244.46 A: right 

245.57 255.73 B: um and so i think it has broadened the knowledge of the majority of people out there um 

256.70 258.23 B: but i just hate 

258.84 261.69 B: how easily it has made 

262.14 265.12 B: hard projects become for the students 

265.73 276.02 A: right and plagiarism plagiarism has become a huge issue a at the school [mn] that i'm that um i'm attending now um 

276.36 277.74 A: there have just been 

277.84 284.40 A: there have been something like sixteen cases of plagiarism just in in er the freshman class 

284.67 288.01 A: you know in freshman english classes so 

284.72 285.70 B: uh-huh 

288.78 289.72 A: i mean 

289.80 298.29 A: that that is it's getting that in that sense it's really ridiculous bu- people buying papers off the internet but 

298.38 307.87 A: i feel like people will plagiarize no matter what it's just you know how difficult are are is how diff- you know how difficult is plagiarism gonna be 

301.38 303.07 B: right 

307.93 309.66 B: (( mhm )) 

309.92 310.87 A: (( but [noise] )) 

311.30 312.36 B: um 

312.70 315.68 B: let's see what else about computers um 

316.69 328.56 B: but i mean i think they they are very useful also in schools because i mean in today's society if you want to work and get a good job you're gonna have to know how to use a computer and use the different programs 

326.30 327.70 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise] )) 

328.57 332.00 B: that are readily used in the in the business world today 

332.09 335.32 B: (( um and and you know there )) 

335.41 339.90 B: there's a main stream of programs out there that are pretty much used in most of of 

340.50 342.45 B: of corporate america 

341.64 346.33 A: [noise] [noise] right y- you gotta know windows you gotta know excel you gotta know 

342.53 343.50 B: um 

345.80 347.55 B: right 

346.77 348.60 A: and 

348.81 354.52 A: it it's almost like we've gotten to the point of being a computer dependant society though i mean i see 

354.61 359.11 A: i see like classmates of mine who do not know how to use a card catalog 

359.44 366.82 B: right right exactly exactly well i mean you can go to the library today and what do they have they [noise] have computers instead of a card and catalogue 

360.03 361.31 A: (( [laughter] )) 

366.44 367.47 A: right 

366.94 370.34 B: you know [laughter] the card catalogue doesn't even exist 

370.49 371.83 B: (( um [noise] [noise] )) 

370.67 377.35 A: right but a lot of times the the older material hasn't been catalogued in the computer yet so 

377.28 386.77 A: you know they're they're doing research projects that basically end at nineteen eighty two [laughter] nothing happened before nineteen eighty two [laughter] apparently 

382.09 383.17 B: uh-huh 

386.09 387.55 B: right 

387.31 389.29 A: you know at least not at my school 

389.66 395.42 A: but yeah i think it's important to have to get kids used to using computers since 

395.72 401.31 A: you know the the quote on quote real world requires you to have you know to have computer knowledge 

402.84 412.14 B: an- and then it's fortunate that schools are able to find computers for their schools um 

413.25 417.57 B: um through grants and so forth because um 

418.63 427.82 B: you know i remember the days when people thought that was virtually impossible you know you did have to go to a private school if you wanted to have computers in your school 

422.27 424.19 A: right 

427.87 431.20 B: and um you know today that's not not the case 

431.26 434.10 A: right i mean there are still 

435.62 440.10 A: there are still a number of like school districts that don't have 

440.60 450.82 A: you know computers in in the schools because even wi- even with the grants there are all the problems of of vandalism and the computers getting stolen i mean it's 

450.09 451.16 B: (( oh my )) 

451.24 454.22 A: it's getting kind of ridiculous to the point where 

454.39 458.16 A: like they're literally locking computers to desks [laughter] 

457.94 458.95 B: uh-huh 

458.63 464.94 A: you know all the different components are padlocked to the desk and that is obviously 

465.04 467.54 A: you know a little extreme [laughter] 

467.47 474.44 B: yeah that is i mean i've never heard of that [laughter] that is kind of [noise] that is the i mean that's pitiful um 

473.25 475.70 A: yeah welcome to new york city [laughter] 

475.16 480.66 B: [laughter] oh we're down in mississippi [laughter] 

478.99 480.03 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

480.49 482.80 A: yeah th- th- you know they they're 

482.93 487.78 A: there are a lot of places it's like they got their computers and then 

488.61 495.08 A: you know the computers got stolen and they don't have money to replace them and you know it's a 

492.78 493.61 B: (( mm )) 

495.14 499.73 A: it really gets into the you know class issues that you know 

500.51 504.36 A: poor people who had their you know [laughter] computer stolen 

504.39 509.18 A: are you know aren't aren't getting their computer experience 

509.24 511.75 A: that they need which is 

511.76 513.65 A: (( you know obviously unfortunate )) 

514.00 515.35 B: (( [mn] um )) 

515.41 523.49 B: i do know that computers were also used um in my school for different projects um like um 

523.59 531.97 B: gosh i'm gonna say it was like maybe an advanced placement history course where we corresponded with students in another country 

532.61 540.59 B: um and actually ended up doing some type of theme where um 

542.14 546.86 B: we were videotaped and w- well it was like a live video cast 

546.26 549.20 A: oh yeah that yeah video streaming 

549.22 550.32 B: um 

550.67 556.37 B: and that was really interesting but that all came about because of the computers because that's where it all began 

556.25 557.24 A: right 

556.85 567.07 B: we all corresponded through email um a- and through the computers so that was [noise] an interesting experience to actually get to correspond with someone that lived in another country 

566.32 580.67 A: yeah that i think that that that's really good 'cause that's a really good way to learn about other cultures until that you know to meet other people i mean what other chances you can er you know you can travel to wherever you are corresponding with 

580.79 592.72 B: [noise] exactly and not only just travel there but i mean if you do travel there what do you stay a week or two you actually don't get to experience the culture that you would over the course of a school year um 

589.05 590.19 A: right 

592.72 599.89 B: [noise] and just get to understand how they view the american society and and just kind of express your views on
