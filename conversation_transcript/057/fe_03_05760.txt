40.48 41.98 A: i think it's good 

41.83 51.69 B: yeah i think so too um i think that you know there needs to be some type of um limit as to you know how much people um 

51.59 58.64 B: can like get educated from like computers you know like there needs to be some you know interpersonal um [lipsmack] 

54.86 55.93 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

56.71 58.01 A: (( mm exactly )) 

58.43 67.19 B: um relationships and and education going on from that aspect as well i mean computers can't do everything for them but they're definitely beneficial as far as like 

67.15 81.19 B: you know gaining knowledge to to different topics and different [noise] different things that you couldn't normally do from [noise] from just talking to someone like some people just don't know everything you know and it's nice to go on a computer and find out you know things that other people don't know 

79.28 80.45 A: right 

81.71 87.43 A: and with the advent of the internet like you have it all information you want to gather from the internet like 

86.79 89.96 B: [noise] [noise] exactly exactly [noise] 

87.48 88.37 A: even if 

89.21 94.13 A: (( so if even if it's on a topic which you don't know anything about it but still you have the )) 

91.82 95.86 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] not paying attention )) 

94.23 94.95 A: to 

95.85 101.56 A: (( so i think the benefit of the computer is like it enhances your education your skill tips )) 

96.18 97.09 B: but 

98.11 99.67 B: (( [noise] )) 

102.29 103.71 A: (( and you know it )) 

102.49 105.67 B: what was that what what what was that sorry i just lost you 

105.88 113.41 A: (( yeah i mean it it it enhances your education and your skills eventually adds values to your existing profile right mhm )) 

112.03 112.99 B: (( [noise] )) 

112.94 127.20 B: [noise] definitely definitely agree with you but ah [noise] i i definitely think that you know there needs to be some type of limit you know as far as how much you can [noise] you know rely upon ah computers to to to become educated um 

115.84 116.81 A: (( right )) 

120.14 121.08 A: mhm 

127.03 128.06 A: (( right right )) 

127.31 134.10 B: [noise] you know 'cause 'cause some skills if you're if you're with a computer like if you're learning if you're in front of a computer eight hours a day 

133.91 142.22 B: you know you know seven days a week or whatever and that's where you're gaining all your knowledge from i think that you know you're losing a lot in other areas you know 

141.55 142.81 A: (( mm )) 

141.99 155.95 B: just by daily interactions with people about like looking at people's facial expressions [noise] and seeing and kind of reading them and and and understanding you know like if you're talking to someone and you know they make a certain face they not understanding what you're saying you know what i'm saying 

154.59 156.32 A: (( right )) 

156.87 164.36 A: right it should a in the both i mean you do with the computer rather than need it let's how do you say the daily interaction 

164.39 167.25 A: you meet people you meet strangers you 

167.51 172.53 A: enhance accurate knowledge from them as well so it should be a mix of the computer as well as 

173.09 175.35 B: definitely i definitely agree with you 

175.24 178.74 A: right so i'm yes 

176.80 177.51 B: (( mm )) 

179.05 180.37 B: so i guess 

180.45 188.42 B: [lipsmack] i guess the ah [noise] the consensus is um it definitely is not it is definitely helpful um 

188.62 202.15 B: for education to be um you know brought on to you by computers but it also you know at at some point it's detrimental because you're not learning different aspects of of of of ah of education you know 

199.77 200.83 A: (( correct )) 

202.00 204.95 A: mhm right that's right 

204.06 205.12 B: so 

206.32 207.76 B: [cough] i guess we ah 

207.90 209.62 B: came to that consensus then 

209.84 217.33 A: [laughter] yes yeah we both agree with this point so there's not much of a debate or [laughter] 

210.37 213.04 B: [laughter] 

213.78 214.87 B: yeah 

215.86 220.22 B: yeah so like it's it's basically the question is like how much 

220.74 226.54 B: like how much computers you know what is the right amount of of computer education 

226.57 238.03 B: you know compared to like um you know non computer education i guess what that that's like the big the the the big question i guess the million dollar question is what is the right amount that computers um 

237.25 237.99 A: yes 

238.17 244.39 B: you know for for the individual and i guess it it varies amongst different people you know some people 

244.42 245.50 B: um 

245.12 246.40 A: (( right [noise] )) 

245.95 250.13 B: you know i i guess some people are s- 

250.22 254.19 B: more interested in learning um 

254.80 266.24 B: [lipsmack] learning like things that you can learn off a computer like facts and and and whatever computer language or whatever it is and there's other individual's like for instance psychologists who 

256.07 256.86 A: (( [noise] )) 

258.83 259.98 A: (( correct correct )) 

265.81 266.59 A: mhm 

266.05 266.88 B: you know 

266.77 272.85 B: need the daily interaction with people that's ho- their basis for their work you know so it's like i guess 

271.30 272.25 A: (( right )) 

272.84 286.98 B: you know that wouldn't be you know a great thing for them to have like computers you know re- it really doesn't do anything for them because it all their work is based of off the interactions and the and the facial expressions and the psychology of someone someone else so it i i guess 

276.17 277.38 A: (( [noise] right )) 

282.80 283.75 A: right 

285.41 288.39 A: yeah it does right 

287.53 289.27 B: (( go ahead )) 

288.59 291.36 A: yeah it does making sitting in front of the computer like say 

291.46 293.21 A: (( six or seven hours a day for )) 

293.40 295.86 A: (( a psychologist as you were just saying )) 

296.63 298.26 B: right yeah so 

298.56 304.91 B: and so i guess yeah i guess it's just it varies as to what type of field you wanna get into 

304.86 306.60 A: right 

304.95 309.16 B: um as far as the education of of computers goes i mean 

309.27 310.26 A: mhm 

309.38 315.40 B: that's what it boils down to what do you really wanna do what kind of career you're trying to pursue what type of knowledge are you trying to gain 

315.36 316.58 A: correct 

316.17 317.54 B: yeah so 

318.17 321.30 B: shit i can't really think of anything else to say on this topic
