181.68 183.52 B: yeah

192.75 194.54 A: [noise] right so 

195.70 200.25 A: right so ah we you know we're the biggest threat i would think but [sigh] [sigh] 

199.84 202.39 B: [sigh] i guess t- threat is a very um 

202.43 204.94 B: subjective term you know [laughter] i mean 

204.15 204.98 A: (( yes )) 

204.95 208.18 B: i guess i mean you know since nine eleven i mean 

208.02 220.07 B: [sigh] everybody feels threatened you know but the people that are doing that i mean it it's j- just awful you know i mean the people but the people who are doing that [sigh] [noise] aren't whole countries it seems to me you know what i mean it it 

209.81 211.47 A: yeah exactly [noise] 

218.77 220.99 A: (( [noise] uh-hum uh-hum )) 

220.38 221.99 B: it's crazy you 

222.11 233.65 B: know groups like you know the al qaeda thing you know and which is you know and i guess some countries must um [mn] help or support them and i'm not up on who they are like i say i'm not political 

224.78 226.35 A: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

233.41 234.30 A: right 

233.61 245.11 B: but um you know that's the only way that a country could be a threat i would think at the moment because the only g- group that that's got it in for the states you know ah t- t- that's made the states its enemy [sigh] 

245.11 249.53 B: a- are really um you know it's that group um 

247.91 249.15 A: (( [sigh] [mn] uh-hum [noise] )) 

249.57 254.98 B: i don't know i don't know enough about iraq i know that's the current thing obviously with the war and everything 

255.07 256.26 B: but i mean 

256.84 260.68 B: i i wondered about the iraq thing only in the sense that [sigh] um 

261.33 268.37 B: you know it was sort almost like a created enemy because there are so many countries with terrible dictators like hussein 

264.32 265.47 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] right )) 

268.51 276.30 B: that are awful and and you know if it was a just world they'd be taken down do you know what i mean but [sigh] why pick this one you know 

268.58 269.41 A: right 

273.79 275.04 A: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

276.70 289.88 A: and [sigh] [laughter] i kind of [noise] think it's 'cause you know his his daddy didn't his daddy didn't do well and [sigh] didn't finish the job that i think that um [sigh] the [laughter] son needs to you know [sigh] needs to get one up on the daddy [sigh] i don't know [sigh] but 

278.22 279.74 B: yeah 

284.01 285.08 B: [laughter] 

289.18 289.98 B: (( yeah [noise] y- yeah )) 

289.89 304.07 A: but even then [mn] like even then i don't if a lot of this also is corporate money [sigh] 'cause osama bin laden is was is a rich man n- n- not because of his country he ha- he has his hands in corporate stuff [sigh] and um 

299.36 301.11 B: (( [sigh] [noise] yeah )) 

303.03 311.97 B: [sigh] yeah he's a frightening individual and a corrupt insincere person in the things he claims to stand for you know i mean jesus christ it's 

306.12 307.08 A: right 

307.59 310.07 A: [sigh] oh the whole corporate world's corrupt [laughter] [sigh] 

311.53 312.22 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

312.33 317.74 B: [noise] you know to be you know so involved in in what he's involved in having you know 

316.28 317.55 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

317.95 322.35 B: obviously he obviously is not e- exactly living in a cave [sigh] 

322.36 325.97 B: living the lifestyle that he's claiming and and that all his supporters 

326.11 334.08 B: are are doing do you know what i mean he he lives a much more [laughter] american life quite honestly you know as a millionaire [laughter] [laughter] 

328.18 329.61 A: oh yeah i def- 

331.24 333.77 A: i d- definitely doubt that yeah 

334.23 335.46 A: (( [sigh] i )) 

334.70 337.13 B: i don't know i don't know enough about it 

335.65 336.44 A: i 

336.63 351.27 A: well see the whole corporate is corrupt in my opinion s- s- so [laughter] like it well not not well i mean it's it's just kind of l- like a b- blanket statement but [sigh] like it's it's out there it's not it's it's you know it's not really [sigh] that uncommon 

340.82 342.49 B: (( yeah yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

351.23 354.89 A: [sigh] to to to see you know pe- you know people support [sigh] 

354.68 369.27 A: certain things and certain things are put under the table and [sigh] at times i think you know the united the um u._s. intelligence know a lil- knows a little bit more than they're willing to let on [sigh] i think they use they they ju- kind of want to get r- rid of u- um what's his name oh god hussein 

369.08 371.28 B: hussein yeah 

369.47 378.93 A: [sigh] but i think they just w- wanted to get rid of him and try to use it a- any means possible just to get r- rid of him [sigh] 'cause he go- well and also [sigh] 

376.79 377.84 B: (( mm uh-huh [noise] )) 

379.05 384.87 A: like i think that at the time and it's all political as well because um after nine eleven 

384.95 390.63 A: [lipsmack] people are are rallying behind the president [sigh] and then it starts you know interest starts to wane 

390.39 391.83 A: [sigh] so [sigh] 

390.51 392.29 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

391.64 402.87 A: okay well you still we y- you we know we're fighting this en- enemy in the middle east [mn] [sigh] we don't we we don't know yet who it is but we know that it it's a coward supposedly [sigh] i- it hits and then runs away [sigh] 

402.74 411.76 A: well someone let's see let's see who [sigh] w- who is a coward in the middle east we can you know we can ca- call a coward [sigh] well we can call hus- hussein a coward because you know 

412.18 423.66 A: [sigh] h- he [laughter] we don't like him he ah he [mn] he a- allegedly which i'm pretty sure he does he allegedly [sigh] tortures people and his sons [sigh] are [sigh] are just r- rogues and you know [sigh] 

423.80 426.25 A: that that's not a new enemy in the east 

424.29 428.96 B: (( [noise] [noise] mm he certainly he certainly is or was a despot you know i mean )) 

428.31 429.61 A: [laughter] yeah 

429.02 434.30 B: (( he's done some terrible things you know and [noise] he he's certainly and you know )) 

434.57 444.70 B: it it's good in the sense that that that he's [sigh] not ruling that country 'cause he did so much harm but [sigh] um i don't personally support the war i mean [sigh] 

440.32 441.36 A: (( [mn] [noise] uh-hum [noise] [sigh] )) 

445.14 448.30 B: i don't know i've got certain misgivings about the
