0.37 2.08 B: hi my name is rueben 

1.77 3.38 A: hi i'm jarred 

2.95 5.17 B: [noise] excuse me jarred 

4.59 5.85 A: yeah you're rueben 

5.60 17.76 B: yeah how are you doing jarred em oh i think er computers improve education and i certainly don't think they hinder education 

6.16 7.44 A: (( a pleasure to meet you )) 

8.17 9.04 A: howdy 

17.64 19.06 A: absolutely 

18.46 20.05 B: i mean er 

20.27 21.93 B: the with the er 

23.12 33.54 B: internet especially all the information that's available to kids now it's just absolutely amazing i think kids are are more educated than when i was younger i'm thirty six 

33.44 39.77 B: um because they're exposed to so much more information i think a lot has to do with er computers 

39.99 41.20 A: absolutely 

41.12 42.28 B: (( so )) 

42.41 46.32 A: it's just the only thing that i think sort of to play devil's [laughter] advocate er 

45.84 48.79 B: (( em )) 

46.39 51.07 A: is perhaps the internet gives a lot of information a lot of which isn't true 

51.27 53.95 A: and how are kids supposed to sort through 

54.38 57.90 A: um what's a reputable source for information there's 

58.00 60.91 A: you sort of lose the hierarchy of of people 

61.14 65.61 A: referring you to information when you're just accessing it based on search count [noise] [noise] 

65.39 78.04 B: [mn] well i mean that that's true whose er probably most kids will look at the internet and er that that you know that's that's law that's er because the internet says it's so that must be true 

78.00 81.91 B: but er i think parents have a role to play in er 

82.29 83.19 B: um 

83.96 87.30 B: overseeing their children's education 

86.96 89.68 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mm absolutely )) 

87.42 88.41 B: um 

89.13 99.94 B: i don't think parents er in this day and age take enough responsibility for ah their children's education i think they wait for everybody else to educate them it's everybody else's job 

99.81 108.72 B: the teachers and stuff and er the parents themselves are not held accountable but er i mean computers like any other invention er 

101.18 102.45 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

103.98 105.53 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] absolutely )) 

107.18 108.31 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

108.81 111.59 B: known to the human race um 

111.86 122.01 B: is intended to be beneficial but there will be always people who try to use it for er crime or er do do bad but um 

115.04 115.75 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

119.24 122.07 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] of course )) 

122.26 128.26 B: yeah but i think for the most part er it's probably one of the greatest inventions er 

128.58 131.50 B: in mankind the computer it's 

131.39 136.01 A: [noise] 

131.64 135.11 B: the information and and the things that er 

135.13 137.57 B: we've been able to do um 

138.37 142.28 B: with computers is just absolutely amazing 

141.70 142.53 A: [noise] 

143.10 144.05 B: so 

143.49 152.45 A: [mn] [noise] [noise] mm i don't know though it would seem i realize exactly i mean how computers are helping but it looks sorry hold on 

152.61 155.89 A: just from looking at empirical evidence er 

152.80 153.38 B: (( [mn] )) 

156.90 162.32 A: looking at test scores and things like that it it seems like the kids are getting less educated progressively 

162.74 164.10 A: (( as times goes on )) 

162.81 167.40 B: well i mean that's true but i think er that goes back to the er 

167.30 177.39 B: parents i think parents nowadays um i think that's where the weak link is in my opinion i think that children have er access to a lot of information 

177.18 188.95 B: er nowadays and certainly children er pre school are a lot smarter than when i was a kid they know a lot more and they're exposed to a lot more but er they also 

184.20 188.67 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

188.95 200.46 B: are lazy nowadays any more they just er sit at home and and i guess the one bad thing about computers is you play games you know one of the proliferations of er computer technology is the er 

200.39 213.12 B: video game industry and they just sit in the house and they n- they're not outside exploring and er being active which leads to a lot of problems in our society with children so ah yeah 

210.38 212.12 A: (( mm [noise] absolutely )) 

212.26 218.64 A: [noise] it also sort of i don't know i mean the i don't know if you could prove this but it seems like if you're not moving around at all 

219.23 223.28 A: your mind isn't working [laughter] as fast as it might be if you were 

221.11 235.91 B: yeah yeah there's like no stimulation not only to your body but to your mind so er i mean there's certainly er down er sides to er computers and things that you can point at that are negative but for the most part i think er 

225.33 226.68 A: absolutely 

234.83 238.09 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

236.29 240.30 B: you know they're they're great they're they're amazing 

239.87 241.60 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

240.15 251.46 B: um but more responsibility has to lay on the um shoulders of parents i guess that's a whole another topic but um the parents have to be a little more responsible too 

245.78 247.38 A: (( absolutely )) 

251.57 254.26 B: in the education of children 

251.84 253.30 A: absolutely 

253.82 263.77 A: and it's interesting that they take very little responsibility for pushing their kids in the right direction but as soon as as soon as they presume that someone else is pushing the kids in the wrong direction it becomes 

263.31 278.26 B: yeah they ah they jump right in there they they're not pro active as far as um guiding the future of their children but er the second they see a negative they're there to take up the cause but they should be pro active instead of reactive 

264.07 265.94 A: a matter of 

277.89 279.51 A: absolutely 

278.46 281.87 B: um that's what my opinion is with that 

281.05 283.32 A: no i agree with you completely [noise] 

282.51 283.89 B: (( so you )) 

284.33 292.26 A: it's strange it seems like [noise] computers are sort of destined to be as good as they are bad and as bad as they are good but it it keeps [laughter] increasing in importance doesn't it 

292.09 296.08 B: know yeah yeah absolutely i mean the things that er 

296.58 311.49 B: you know because of the computer um the other technologies that we don't see like safety in vehicles and er the things like that that have you know allowed us to achieve er are absolutely amazing 

306.09 307.75 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

311.87 313.67 A: absolutely 

312.58 315.01 B: but er yeah i think er 

316.97 319.86 B: they've also um given 

320.01 321.00 B: er 

321.06 324.39 B: instrument for education because er 

324.71 333.52 B: you know people can be educated through computers over long distances my wife for example has taken an online correspondence course at a university 

333.19 334.80 A: yeah 

333.48 341.35 B: where you know she gets university credit for and she never has to go to class she turns in her assignments over the computer and er 

341.46 345.41 B: discussions over her computer and um 

346.46 357.77 B: [mn] so not just in educating children but in the tools it gives you for communication um and that's a big part of education is communication so what that allows you is er 

347.19 349.17 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] absolutely )) 

355.34 357.27 A: (( yeah absolutely )) 

358.64 360.69 B: is amazing 

360.56 366.26 A: it's sort of revolutionized how people need each other and how people interact with each other as well 

365.59 368.46 B: yeah yeah [noise] i often wonder what er 

368.84 379.11 B: i mean it's even hard to imagine what it was like without email and without mac machines and stuff like that but at one time that's the way [laughter] things were and that wasn't too long ago 

375.29 376.90 A: absolutely 

377.29 378.31 A: of course 

380.23 383.23 B: so a lot of things we take for granted 

381.27 381.83 A: (( [mn] )) 

382.63 384.56 A: yeah absolutely i can remember 

385.12 392.57 A: it it amazes me now that 'cause i mean with the way the technology is developing if you're lost you can call someone and ask them for directions while you're driving 

391.77 396.13 B: i don't know exactly exactly yeah thanks to computers 

396.32 397.99 A: absolutely 

396.38 397.59 B: so 

398.04 398.83 B: (( er i've )) 

398.81 407.01 B: i i can't see overall i mean certainly people can point to negative aspects of computers and society and then education of children [sigh] 

407.00 421.87 B: because er like you pointed out it gives them access to information that may not be correct [sigh] or information you may not want them to know about but i just can't see um one on the whole them being negative to er education of children 

421.58 423.29 A: no absolutely 

421.87 425.62 B: certainly er more positive that negative 

425.25 434.61 A: but of course the fear again getting back to what the parents are doing is that people will take computer access as a substitute for proactive education 

434.49 448.41 B: yeah yeah yeah absolutely you know it it almost they almost make you lazy they really do because er the they're such they provide such a convenience and ease of use for children that er 

440.96 443.15 A: absolutely absolutely 

448.62 449.59 B: (( you know )) 

449.69 453.44 A: [noise] you don't really have to know anything because the computer can know it for you 

453.23 464.86 B: ye- and and that's where the technology is going nowadays you know the the less you need to know and just need to point and shoot at the correct picture and you get what you want so 

463.80 465.77 A: (( [noise] absolutely )) 

464.96 465.95 B: um 

466.65 475.33 B: i don't know that's that's an interesting argument for a negative for er computers because er almost makes you like a zombie like you don't really have to think 

475.24 477.11 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

475.80 478.07 B: um it does everything for you 

478.67 479.53 B: (( you know )) 

478.92 481.70 A: [noise] but at the same time it allows you to gather 

481.87 488.87 A: to sort of perhaps think more complexly it allows you to have access to much more information than you could have in your head at any one time i suppose 

487.97 491.29 B: yeah i remember when i was in school the er [mn] 

491.27 498.87 B: they didn't want you to have calculators because they wanted you to be able to think it through it's almost like the same thing you know calculator made you er 

498.76 507.62 B: lazy um you just punch in the numbers and it gives you the answer and it didn't let you exercise your brain so but er 

499.32 501.42 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

504.91 505.70 A: (( [noise] yeah mm )) 

506.42 513.20 A: and i suppose the the argument that could be made by someone is that well now that you have something that can do any 

513.34 520.62 A: arithmetic problem for you instantly why do you need to know it but as you say it's it's a matter of exercising your brain 

515.66 517.35 B: yeah 

519.38 532.88 B: yeah absolutely which leads to other stimulus i guess but um again for the most part computers and education you know you can't deny it's a positive but there are definitely er 

524.26 525.81 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

532.85 536.14 B: you could find nothing's perfect 

536.13 537.51 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah of course )) 

540.30 542.34 A: (( of course yeah it's interesting though )) 

542.59 544.27 B: (( so yeah )) 

542.68 545.86 A: it's a very different world from from growing up 

545.23 546.36 B: (( yeah )) 

547.22 548.55 A: you're thirty six 

550.54 551.27 A: (( hello )) 

550.56 552.03 B: (( yeah hello )) 

551.89 552.66 A: hi 

552.63 557.64 B: oh okay i i heard somebody come on and say you have thirty seconds 

553.55 554.56 A: sorry 

556.82 558.80 A: no no i said you're thirty six 

558.62 560.97 B: oh oh yes i'm thirty six and you 

560.55 562.05 A: yeah i'm twenty two 

561.86 567.21 B: twenty two oh so you're er just out of school or still in school 

564.30 566.35 A: i'm a little closer to 

566.42 567.96 A: no i just got out of school 

567.79 570.04 B: yeah yeah so er 

570.16 574.10 B: you know you can you have a better er grasp of er 

574.20 580.50 B: the whole computers and education thing think from your own education how much er computers contributed to er 

580.62 584.19 B: your education and how much er in er 

581.88 583.48 A: yeah 

585.03 590.60 B: need er they were and things like that of that nature 

586.25 588.10 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

589.62 599.89 A: well look i sort of watched them sort of come up through the time that i was in school you know when [laughter] i started out we had nothing and then at one point there was an apple two in the comp- 

594.55 595.85 B: yeah
