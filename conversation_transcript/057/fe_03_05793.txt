52.51 55.34 B: it it hasn't been there always 

54.59 56.68 A: right right right 

56.25 58.98 B: so it has a i guess

69.30 71.09 A: i know that experience um 

71.38 80.83 A: and i definitely family has a deep meaning to me because of the stresses that you know we all experience from that and um i come from a big family so

89.97 92.08 A: there's a lot there [laughter] 

90.96 99.41 B: mhm now when when your parents divorced did ah did did ah it's like all of you stay with one parent or did did you split up

111.06 113.80 B: (( hm )) 

113.60 114.80 A: but um 

114.62 123.56 A: generally it means a lot to to me um just because it's ah you know probably the most important support you know 

121.94 123.17 B: right 

123.38 132.00 A: that's about um if i'm having troubles or anything like that sometimes obviously it can be a little overwhelming 'cause my mom likes to sort of gossip a lot you know 

131.63 132.98 B: mhm 

132.29 134.07 A: [laughter] so ah 

133.53 137.60 B: yeah yeah did your parents ah have they remarried or

142.19 151.06 B: yeah my dad did um about four years after the divorce and which of course brought another family member sort of in 

151.35 166.21 B: and so um and her situation which is very interesting i mean she's a lot younger than my dad and you know um family i mean she she's also from a from a i mean not also but she's from a really interesting or kind of screwed up background but 

151.37 152.82 A: (( right right )) 

166.25 167.46 B: um 

169.42 174.09 B: [mn] she came in and and suddenly she had technically she had two children

174.21 175.16 A: wow 

179.75 182.42 B: a- acting the role so 

181.20 183.85 A: (( [noise] right right [noise] ))

184.19 186.12 A: (( that must have been interesting )) 

186.01 198.97 B: it's an interesting dynamic [laughter] yes [laughter] but i don't know i i guess i guess i mean i know f- i mean [mn] fam- family itself i think like you said i mean it it it it sort of 

189.23 190.43 A: yeah 

199.44 207.07 B: to me it's sort of the backbone in a way that you go to that you kind of feel inside sometimes when you're when you're 

207.36 208.35 B: um 

208.41 210.04 B: weak maybe 

209.82 212.00 A: yeah yeah

214.68 216.06 B: you want to share that 

218.04 221.83 A: in my case i know that it it explains a lot for those 

222.03 226.41 A: i mean it explains a lot in the [laughter] in the good ways i am you know 

224.54 225.54 B: mhm 

225.87 228.41 B: yeah are you thinking about having a family of your own 

228.38 231.34 A: yeah actually my wife is now eight months pregnant so

238.88 240.94 B: eleven years so 

240.38 241.73 A: oh wow 

241.20 247.95 B: yeah but we were both musicians at the time so we didn't you know it was not a you know a very very pleasant thing to 

248.21 250.76 B: you know bring up a kid in that environment so 

250.84 254.09 A: oh wow oh what kind of what kind of instrument do you play 

251.58 252.71 B: yeah 

253.76 259.30 B: um i sing and i play drums and keyboard so there was a v- a a variety of different things 

259.26 264.60 A: oh wow ah yeah my brother's just going through a divorce now after ten years of marriage 

260.02 260.89 B: yeah 

262.98 264.19 B: yeah 

264.60 266.65 B: it sucks it's the worst thing 

265.67 267.63 A: he's 

267.24 279.01 B: and espe- and especially 'cause i mean your your as you know i mean your your your wife is i mean at least you know is supposed to be and i'm sure it is for you too i mean your best friend and 

278.51 279.72 A: right 

279.10 284.32 B: and that's still the case with me we're still best [laughter] friends that's why we're not married so 

284.46 289.01 B: that's a weird family situation and it's also really weird with um 

289.33 293.16 B: i was very very close to her side of the family and um 

293.78 299.98 B: and suddenly you know it's it's you get a you have sort of a different role technically but you're still the same person 

300.00 303.93 A: right right yeah 

300.97 307.94 B: you know but it's it's been really it took it took it took about two years to s- for that to stabilize i guess 

308.14 309.33 A: wow 

308.76 313.35 B: yeah so don't get divorced okay [laughter] 

311.69 322.69 A: [laughter] ah ah interesting 'cause i mean fam- that's family plays a big role in that too i lived for a long time in west africa and there they say that the um 

320.35 321.35 B: mhm 

322.96 330.91 A: that if the wife is close to the husband's family he he basically can never divorce her 'cause the family will refuse the family has a lot more influence 

327.58 328.87 B: mhm 

330.51 331.75 B: right 

331.26 339.70 A: you know in in a traditional culture here family doesn't have that much influence on who you choose to marry i mean it's not nearly as much as in other cultures 

336.95 337.89 B: right 

339.58 340.66 B: yeah 

340.14 348.91 A: you know i mean i always find that amazing here some some of my friends in west africa you know where they have arranged marriages they're like w- what 

346.18 347.40 B: mhm 

347.51 351.85 B: i i was i was just going to ask you ask you about that i mean wouldn't that be kind of odd to 

352.56 362.94 B: i mean i know some i know actually quite a quite a few couples um that are sort of arranged yeah and um i've always wondered i've never dared to ask them 

358.56 359.69 A: oh really 

363.02 364.05 B: you know 

363.20 365.47 A: right 

364.48 375.99 B: that intimately because i mean they're they to sort of let you know that that's not they're not really open talking about those things but they appear to be happy but i really wonder how that works 

371.82 372.90 A: right 

376.23 381.00 A: well i have a friend who's arranged arranged and he's they they're really happy together

384.07 384.91 B: yeah 

388.15 393.25 A: they get asked about it all the time just 'cause we live in new york city and you know people don't 

390.00 391.10 B: mhm 

392.28 393.19 B: right 

393.27 395.96 A: shy away from asking things like that here [laughter] 

395.12 396.90 B: mhm [laughter] 

396.16 397.65 A: where where do you live at 

397.04 398.82 B: i'm in boston 

398.53 400.07 A: oh okay uh-huh 

399.17 405.95 B: yeah so i mean i mean there's some some people of course are open to it but you know it it's it's you can go 

406.29 407.27 B: you know 

407.49 416.35 B: to a certain extent and and sort of past that you can tell it's sort of you may sort of strike a nerve or hit a nerve somewhere 

415.95 418.57 A: right right absolutely that can be 

417.72 418.67 B: but ah 

419.14 427.38 B: so what what did you feel af- after your parents got divorced did you did what w- what was the weirdest thing about it that you sort of sticks 

425.85 428.70 A: (( the the weirdest thing about my parents' divorce )) 

428.10 429.71 B: yeah 

428.97 429.76 A: (( ah )) 

430.22 431.26 A: um 

432.34 436.40 A: i don't know that there was anything that i remember as particularly weird 

436.47 437.51 A: because i 

436.73 439.41 B: or or that you disliked the most 

439.83 447.45 A: well what did i dislike most ah well just the disruption and just the whole you know sort of routine life 

445.38 446.28 B: mhm 

447.55 448.51 B: yeah 

447.73 453.08 A: you know all the instability like where are you going to live and all that you know where are people that was 

450.84 451.80 B: mhm 

452.30 453.40 B: mhm 

453.03 467.24 A: the most disrupting thing is where the hell is dad you know [laughter] and where are we going to live and you know well you know what happens to the old idea of you know of a family home you know and and what happens 

454.67 455.59 B: yeah 

456.41 457.30 B: right 

464.89 465.87 B: mhm 

467.23 472.54 A: to the whole idea of family i mean you know you sort of get the idea that it's like oh well 

468.70 469.55 B: right 

472.57 477.61 A: you know it doesn't really count you know it's not significant how how what about you 

474.50 475.51 B: mhm 

477.97 482.46 B: i i think the biggest thing and it's actually probably 

482.49 486.53 B: um still the case i i don't feel since i don't have a 

487.05 492.68 B: sort of my own family um but it's it's it's n- i never should have had a 

493.03 497.81 B: true sort of christmas or holiday or kind of birthday 

497.76 498.88 A: oh wow 

499.36 504.21 B: that the way that it used to be 'cause i mean there's so many memories you know attached to you know the sort of 

504.13 515.13 B: magical christmas or you know whatever you know some holiday that's significant to you you know and and i used to really enjoy that and i mean i was i was fourteen when my parents got divorced so 

506.11 507.30 A: (( right right )) 

515.25 517.63 A: oh i was like sixteen yeah 

515.31 516.27 B: um 

517.16 522.59 B: yeah so i mean it was it was just like you said total disruption of everything 

522.63 525.31 A: (( yeah yeah destroying )) 

523.36 527.46 B: and but i ah but i i think what what um 

528.37 534.85 B: [mn] what ah i i just couldn't figure out at the time because my parents obviously hid you know a 

535.42 539.30 B: lot of that the problems you know a little bit too well 

539.27 549.54 B: so when when the divorce actually came it was like huh [laughter] you know [laughter] you're going to do what [laughter] yeah so 

543.48 545.74 A: [laughter] 

549.52 555.44 B: i don't know the sense of family and what it means to one i mean is is is ah 

555.81 557.99 A: it really depends on your experience 

557.39 558.80 B: i think so 

558.55 564.36 A: yeah because if it gets tested then you're right you know you get a better sense of what it means 

558.92 560.23 B: i really do 

563.95 566.81 B: yeah did did you ev- did you ever um 

564.65 565.50 A: yeah 

567.35 576.73 B: like ah look look at other kids' families you know after your parents' divorce and sort of got envious so you know that they actually have their parents together and 

571.58 572.92 A: oh yeah 

576.63 581.99 A: yeah i remember doing that a little bit not to a great extent but to some extent yeah 

576.81 578.82 B: (( you know mm )) 

580.65 584.41 B: right yeah i mean you always you do the parallel you know 

582.14 583.98 A: (( definitely )) 

584.63 585.93 A: exactly 

585.42 586.20 B: (( you know )) 

586.24 587.98 A: exactly wow 

587.58 591.15 B: yeah it's it's [laughter] 

590.02 593.56 A: it means a lot but you know it does definitely mean um 

594.54 599.89 A: you know it definitely takes meaning like it's tested you know and in my own family my brothers had some 

597.58 598.60 B: yeah
