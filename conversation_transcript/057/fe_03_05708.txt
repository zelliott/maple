20.13 29.72 A: um i don't know especially living in new york after seeing the whole thing and ah you know september a couple of years ago i think it kinda opened a lot of people's eyes to the idea of what could be a threat 

28.67 30.51 B: (( yep yeah exactly [mn] )) 

30.66 32.57 B: (( so you actually saw it you were there ))

49.46 50.35 B: yeah 

51.75 58.60 B: yeah that's got to be [cough] i can't even imagine seeing that man mhm [mn] crazy enough seeing it on t._v. yeah 

56.11 68.16 A: yeah it was pretty yeah it was um yeah seeing it kinda changed the ideas of i think everybody sort of felt that you know nothing would ever really happen here 

67.26 73.13 B: yeah it can wake you up and ah make you realize you're not ah a hundred per cent safe 

72.86 74.71 A: yeah 

74.64 78.79 B: but ah as far as other countries by other countries they 

79.28 83.55 B: do they just mean ah any country other than like iraq and afghan 

82.79 88.15 A: yeah yeah i don't know if they're asking yeah particularly i don't know i never really trusted canada 

87.98 89.69 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

88.55 95.00 A: [laughter] they've been so nice and quiet for so many years [laughter] [laughter] they they gotta be plotting something 

89.79 90.53 B: yeah 

91.80 93.54 B: (( [laughter] yeah they did [laughter] )) 

94.01 100.33 B: they do yeah [laughter] i i don't know there's a lot of talk about ah north korea and stuff i guess 

95.05 96.83 A: yeah 

99.86 112.24 A: yeah that's more interesting kind of a rogue nation you know going against and all that having bin part of the nonnuclear proliferation treaty and then you know going ahead and decrying any nuclear weapons 

111.96 115.27 B: yeah every time i hear something from them they seem to be ah 

115.50 119.36 B: going against whatever ah we're trying to to do or yeah 

118.80 125.88 A: yeah that seems to be one country that's almost out to go against you know any sort of any sort of peace making movements 

125.55 129.14 B: yeah you never hear them agreeing with anybody else they're always like 

128.56 140.08 A: yeah i mean i've always felt that you know we have enough of a military that if anyone did attack the united states it wouldn't you know it would be something that would be quickly defended 

139.07 140.70 B: yeah 

140.06 144.35 A: but i i wouldn't say that it's completely impossible from happening 

143.95 145.54 B: (( oh yeah )) 

144.56 153.55 A: i think that of any threats i think that probably north korea and then you know with with the war in iraq you know any of those related things and any sort of retaliation 

153.45 159.51 B: yeah yeah i think the biggest danger is still like you know pocket resistance type things 

159.46 163.90 A: yeah exactly the smaller kinda al qaeda sort of little groups 

160.57 161.46 B: (( yeah mm )) 

163.73 165.44 B: (( yep )) 

164.92 167.15 A: less organized sort of attack 

168.70 173.02 B: yeah i don't see any ah major country any time soon ah 

173.18 175.72 B: (( trying anything against us hm yeah )) 

174.72 187.65 A: yeah i just don't i don't think it would be prudent you know with with their military things and just you know i don't think anybody wants to upset the world balance i think that they realize that any sort of attack and not just on america but on a lot of countries that are 

187.07 188.22 B: yeah yeah mm 

187.66 193.64 A: i mean relatively peaceful depending on who you ask you know i i think that if you're just going to go out and attack 

190.70 191.28 B: (( yeah )) 

193.82 200.73 A: a country and there's going to be you know a sort of you see what happened with iraq where the whole word kinda you know gets behind it 

200.94 203.05 B: (( yeah the economy don't do so well )) 

201.23 208.00 A: so i think that that's gonna i think that's gonna deter any nation from from attacking us or any likewise nation 

207.82 210.65 B: yeah except for maybe france because they'll just surrender 

210.33 213.09 A: yeah [laughter] exactly 

212.32 213.85 B: [laughter] 

214.73 217.23 A: that's one i wouldn't have to worry about too much

228.79 231.57 B: ah jokes about france and stuff like that [laughter] 

230.58 234.57 A: yeah exactly it's always nice to have a reason to joke about france i guess 

233.96 238.26 B: exactly planting the trees so the ger- so the germans can march in the shade and all that 

237.43 238.75 A: [laughter]
