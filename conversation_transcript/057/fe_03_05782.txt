104.97 119.54 A: has sent to both of us that is really um unimportant and and i consider something that is s- is simply taking up my time so i might call her to complain ah she certainly understands what i'm going through and she experiences the same thing

179.26 183.68 A: um that's going to be fun ah maybe we'll get together hang out occasionally 

183.80 187.90 A: um we haven't had a lot of time to like sort of form a bond um 

188.35 192.32 A: you know because she's lived far away and you know 

191.46 192.82 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

192.52 196.13 A: all that so i'm kind of looking forward to getting to know her better

203.12 204.10 B: mhm

215.15 216.67 A: and it's you know 

217.03 228.64 A: and then i you know it's so far for her and stuff and you know she wants you to like come stay with her for you know extended periods of time and and yeah other than i'll go out and visit her occasionally you know 

228.91 236.29 A: um i don't have a lot of time you know to be writing her letters and to be listening to her saying she wants to and all that stuff 

236.49 239.71 A: and she lives you know she moved to a retirement community 

239.89 241.51 A: [mn] but she like never 

241.69 244.83 A: ever like gets out and meets the other folks you know 

244.47 245.62 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

245.01 251.09 A: and you know they have a club house there's so many opportunities for her to do that to you know um 

251.32 253.73 A: create positive peer groups you know with 

253.75 261.76 A: other peers but ah she chooses not to do that and the only people that she talks to in her community ah are her neighbors you know 

260.64 261.22 B: (( [mn] )) 

261.48 263.03 B: yeah 

262.70 263.84 A: so it's 

263.86 271.85 A: [mn] you know so she has ah she has plenty of things that she can do but she chooses to sit at home and watch t._v. and feel sorry for herself 

272.01 280.16 A: and you know i i mean i continue to tell her that you know why don't you 'cause like they play poker in the club house they you know 

280.29 288.51 A: um have dances and you know exercise and all that stuff and all these things are sent to her m- monthly with a schedule you know 

287.89 289.59 B: right 

288.54 290.58 A: all she has to do is show up 

290.60 298.85 A: then she complains about her knees and you know all this stuff and it's just like i really don't think she has any that she's you know 

299.19 303.18 A: put herself into this situation where she's sulking and you know 

303.31 305.70 A: feels trapped and can't move on 

305.75 306.72 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

306.11 312.21 A: i'm not saying that she should just you know forget that she lost you know her partner of many years but 

312.31 319.02 A: you know there's certainly plenty of more productive things to do than sit you know in front of the t._v. all day and and gorge yourself [noise] 

318.43 319.74 B: absolutely 

319.70 334.26 B: i i actually ah ah i have a a similar ah a similar problem with ah with my mom she's ah ah basically um she's been divorced since ah you know for twelve years she never got remarried and she just kind of ah 

334.56 343.54 B: um just kind of degenerated [laughter] just stays home you know she lost her job like four years' ago and she never she never got another one 

338.40 339.29 A: yeah 

343.26 344.53 A: wow 

343.49 357.69 B: and yeah and ah she ah i i guess it's everything's kind of exacerbated by a a drinking problem and you know and there's nothing i can do about it you know nothing i say has any meaning to her and ah 

351.41 353.22 A: [noise] oh mhm 

357.24 358.64 A: (( right )) 

357.90 364.88 B: and so i i've had to essentially ah ah cut her off and not not speak with her anymore because it's just too 

364.81 374.18 B: it's just too frustrating and depressing you know i know that given given the chance she would manipulate me into you know whatever she needs 

367.92 369.24 A: oh yeah 

374.18 380.79 B: you know that c- that's that's the only relationship she has with me is that that she you know tries to get me to do things that 

374.24 375.20 A: right 

381.14 393.73 B: ah she needs and and it's just it's after a while it just burned out and um [mn] and [mn] you know when it comes to ah when it comes to family i i always ah i always imagine that it 

386.61 387.99 A: yeah 

393.58 398.95 B: you know had a lot to do with kind of like you know keeping keeping the human race going i mean supporting 

398.80 410.89 B: supporting the young 'til they're old enough to support s- support themselves and you know caring for people when they're sick and you know ah keeping morale up you know during hard times and everything 

410.86 423.32 B: um but ah you know i've seen that it in you know and i know that in the past you know family structures were were much stronger than they are today and and i'm you know i'm kind of living proof of that 

423.19 430.44 B: ah you know my my family essentially just fell apart under this kind of storm of greed and and you know 

430.31 438.64 B: lust and ah you know they started w- we started out as a strong family but you know there was just too many ah temptations on the outside you know 

438.56 445.88 B: both my parents had affairs they both got involved with drugs and you know by the time i was twelve years' old everything had collapsed 

442.25 443.14 A: (( mm )) 

446.12 458.84 B: and you know i had to kind of try to redefine what family really meant to me because i know it ah 'cause i know that the traditional mother father you know nuclear family ah didn't work 

458.92 462.91 B: ah especially especially in this case um 

463.44 464.48 B: (( [mn] ah )) 

464.97 470.20 B: [sigh] ah it's just that ah i'm not i'm i'm not clear anymore what really a family is 

470.16 471.46 B: ah i don't 

471.40 474.75 B: ah i don't ah see any evidence of it being 

474.69 484.32 B: helpful in a lot of situations i mean my parent ah my my friends parents helped them out and they're you know they have a good relationship and you know and then i have to deal with with the fact that 

484.19 494.84 B: you know i i can't handle my own relationship with my parents you know that i don't speak with either of them and you know and that's that's life that's how it goes but ah 

491.60 492.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

495.14 497.34 A: [noise] wow i really 

495.27 498.42 B: um i do have a very strong what's that 

497.87 499.06 A: go ahead 

498.52 504.85 B: ah i do have a very strong relationship with my brother though i mean ah i've i've lived with him for the past three years and ah 

504.81 519.72 B: we make a pretty good team you know sometimes it's almost like we're married but that's kind of bizarre [laughter] but um we're n- you know it's not like that it's just like we're you know we're really we get along really well together and have similar interests and you know he's a great guy 

508.78 509.70 A: (( [laughter] )) 

510.01 510.81 A: (( oh )) 

519.65 521.84 B: you know what what more could you ask for 

521.73 523.24 A: (( mhm )) 

522.68 523.77 B: um 

524.38 525.43 B: [mn] so 

525.11 529.31 A: i can sort of identify with all the turmoil that brings ah siblings together 

529.45 535.45 A: um i had an abusive stepfather for many years um you know who i mean literally 

535.80 537.50 A: ah to killing me a few times 

537.71 545.96 A: ah my sister stepped in and you know protected me you know a number of times and because of all that you know that we did went went through together 

545.78 546.58 B: mhm 

545.93 555.14 A: you know we're much closer you know not that we talk a whole lot but it's just like you know we just even though she's kind of like a private person 

554.89 555.93 B: (( mm mhm )) 

555.29 556.43 A: but um 

556.61 565.67 A: you know ah just like when we're together you know we just you know and then we know you know everything about each other and you know we don't really need to talk to be close you know 

565.49 566.75 B: yeah 

566.14 567.81 A: you know what i'm saying it's a little weird 

568.25 575.96 A: but i really surprised that you're able to come over all those challenges all those obstacles in your life and the two of you seem you know to be making your way in the world 

576.42 582.31 B: yeah it it is kind of surprising i mean i don't you know sometimes i look back at my childhood and it doesn't really seem like you know 

582.16 596.66 B: i was really meant to survive in the long time you know it you know my parents just kind of just forgot you know [laughter] they had children and then they just got so involved in their own their own thing that you know we were we were often neglected and and 

591.46 592.49 A: (( mm )) 

596.72 599.89 B: you know we we we still suffer t- from from that to this day
