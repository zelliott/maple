55.13 61.61 B: well you know um ah my family is is my wife is with me in brooklyn and ah 

61.60 72.50 B: my i have two sons and a daughter and my ah two sons one's in baskin ridge new jersey and the other one lives in manhattan and my daughter lives in florida 

71.48 73.68 A: mhm ah so ah grown children okay

77.30 80.75 B: and ah we have a little dog here with us

82.97 88.51 A: oh mhm and ah ah joel do you have ah brothers sisters and an- and any other family in the area okay 

87.31 93.71 B: i have one brother lives in new jersey and my mom lives in ah new jersey and my father passed away 

93.54 102.16 A: mm okay yeah um it sounds like i [mn] i [mn] i i i i'm guessing i'm just a bit younger than you i mean um i'm forty forty three years' old which 

101.29 103.76 B: yeah i'm fif- i'm fifty 

102.85 107.92 A: okay um yeah my mom and dad are still alive they're ah they still live in helens falls 

107.97 116.70 A: not i'm not married though and i guess the first thing that came to my mind as i was listening to you is um you talk about your wife and your kids and i was trying to compare mhm 

114.77 117.71 B: (( right in fact ah well you know we ah )) 

117.76 128.72 B: we live in ah in brooklyn new york we have a place down in florida but ah you know it's very hard because ah my daughter's down in florida and my two sons and grandchildren are here 

129.34 133.72 B: so it it it's which way do i go where do i stay or what do 

133.48 144.12 A: well and and actually that was my first thought w- when i found out about your ah children and age and so forth my first my my thought was gee i'm not married what if i was was married where would my 

144.95 151.17 A: [mn] anyway how would that change a relationship with my with my parents how would my prior- you know would would would my pr- mhm 

149.90 160.56 B: i do it's a- it's very difficult to know which way to go i mean my wife would rather be you know not rather be she likes to be next to the grandchildren of course to see them grow up and be with them 

159.12 160.77 A: [mn] you bet 

160.34 170.06 B: and yet ah my daughter's in florida which we like to see her and what she's going to do one day she's going to have children and so forth so it's very it's a very hard thing 

170.11 182.56 A: mhm and i guess joel also in my case um i do live with with suzanne who i've been with for the last eight years but you know w- we're not married so that's still i mean she's family but not the same kind of family 

178.28 180.05 B: right 

181.58 184.00 B: exactly exactly 

182.36 195.91 A: you know i i i put suzanne in the same class as see i i guess my definition of family is a bit extended where um i have friends but the friends i've had i've literally had these let's say eight to ten friends for the last twenty five years 

195.12 197.12 B: that's wonderful to have those 

195.88 201.25 A: and you know you know they're you know they're about as close to family as as as as you can get really mhm 

200.02 205.63 B: that's right you have that many friends for eight to twenty five years or whatever they are you're a very lucky guy 

206.25 210.84 A: got to be we we we we we got we got to be able to get something right i guess huh huh 

210.35 217.64 B: you know because you know they have friends and do things with and sometimes this is most ah more you know important as having family around with you 

217.32 227.62 A: yeah and and actually in in my case joel ah ah i'm finding that as i grow older that that the doing things with them is not as important as just having someone there you know 

227.39 235.66 A: just you know just a case of having someone to talk to or just in case just just ah know just knowing someone is there is im- is is important 

230.96 232.32 B: exactly 

235.42 243.14 B: exactly exactly so ah you know this is something ah ah you got to decide how come you moved to atlanta georgia atlanta georgia 

236.48 237.62 A: [cough] 

243.22 245.87 A: why am i here um i've been here for 

244.74 247.52 B: you got a job down there obviously probably 

246.98 261.43 A: um y- yeah i do work occasionally but what brought me down here initially was was school and i was just too i was not motivated enough to leave at well ah the first job i got got was here in atlanta so i guess i just stayed for the last twenty five years yeah 

261.21 268.00 A: um do i really do i really want to be here no not really i'm just too lazy to do anything about it i mean 

266.62 268.64 B: uh-huh oh you don't like atlanta 

268.58 276.00 A: ah you know what's there to like you know i mean there's there's there's there's there's no ocean there's no mountains there's no like you know big cultural stuff like there is in the city there so 

275.22 281.65 B: yeah well yeah that's what i said when i was down in florida there's nothing like new york once you're in florida really 

280.25 287.75 A: mhm and you know um yeah on the family on the topic of family i mean you know my parents would would love it if if i moved closer you know 

288.78 290.79 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

289.25 291.84 A: w- what what they they always harp on 

291.81 299.09 A: harping on on me about for the last you know ten twenty five years it's you know why did you have to move so far away it's actually um i ha- i have n- 

299.03 310.99 A: ah the only sibling i have is my younger brother who is also in in in in atlanta which makes it easy on them when they come to visit you only have to visit one place but you know it's always you know why did you guys have to move so far away kind of thing
