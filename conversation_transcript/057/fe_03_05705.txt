29.65 30.84 A: um 

31.98 32.84 A: i'm 

32.98 39.80 A: the the big thing here though is that none of 'em can match up to the united states 

40.05 46.52 A: as far as power and weapons and such like that so because of that reason

99.41 100.79 A: mhm 

100.14 101.91 B: they weren't 

102.11 103.93 B: trained in 

104.02 105.76 B: according to 

105.78 117.51 B: a western country's idea of a of a of of an army but then again they're still trained in certain tactics and you know and in a way 

109.88 111.39 A: okay that's true 

117.51 124.12 B: it is an army so they were able to inflict damage upon us even though 

124.82 129.87 B: you know there was it's even though it's not an army in western

134.48 137.29 A: well i mean the threat is clearly there 

138.01 141.23 A: but the type of damages they will do 

142.02 144.93 A: on overall will be 

144.96 146.14 A: small 

146.47 148.56 A: and 

148.81 150.75 A: the way i see it is like 

151.34 153.56 A: a huge threat would be like 

154.11 156.08 A: coming and taking over the country 

156.22 166.79 B: well i don't hopefully i don't think that's something we'll have to deal with in the near future um but you know a psychological 

162.41 163.36 A: uh-huh 

167.58 169.78 B: (( threat can )) 

170.18 178.55 B: can equally well equally damage can damage the united states in in in in a certain respect that [mn] 

178.85 179.83 B: you know

208.09 209.42 A: yeah 

208.93 211.27 B: so as well so um 

211.81 217.25 B: [mn] you know whatever was if we're using al qaeda as a as um 

216.93 218.14 A: excuse [laughter] 

217.98 219.94 B: an excuse an example 

220.13 222.37 B: um you know 

223.19 231.58 B: they they i i'm assuming that they got what they wanted out of this in many respects 

231.83 240.02 B: um you know one life taken is too many in my opinion the thing is that i'm sorry 

237.61 238.38 A: that's 

240.73 248.26 B: the you know the thousands of lives that were taken it wasn't that a hundred thousand lives were taken or a million lives were taken 

248.34 253.95 B: but w- one life taken is too many in my opinion so you know 

254.07 262.23 B: it it it's not only that but they they they really helped to um 

263.32 267.42 B: [mn] to put a terrible negative impact on the economy 

267.18 268.22 A: mhm 

267.62 276.53 B: and ah you know there are certain industries that have not bounced back n- nor do i foresee them bouncing back in the near future 

276.14 276.97 A: okay 

276.59 279.52 B: so even though we might have you know 

280.35 291.75 B: f- a very strong mighty powerful army and navy and air force and marines the armed forces it doesn't necessarily mean that we're um 

292.23 293.86 B: (( [mn] what's the word or phrase that )) 

293.99 298.60 B: that we're eg- no extent isn't the word that we're 

299.26 306.99 B: totally protected quote unquote from things that people bad harm that people would wish upon us 

306.71 307.58 A: okay 

307.55 308.81 B: (( so ah )) 

309.32 320.75 B: i don't know you know i don't only think it's m- m- muslim countries per se that dislike the united states i think that a lot of uh-huh a lot of countries don't like us 

320.23 321.55 A: [laughter] 

320.89 325.42 B: and it's not just this the predominant religion is is ah 

325.89 328.22 B: is [mn] you know is ah 

329.24 335.96 B: oh i'm sorry i had a long day i can't even think right now is a is a muslim religion so ah is a 

331.49 332.88 A: [laughter] 

336.40 341.80 B: you know it's it's like that so um you know there are ple- there are countries where 

342.07 351.22 B: ah the predominant religion is christianity when the people aren't fond of the united states or americans or you know any other 

351.47 358.45 B: religion i don't think it's just based on one particular religious religious groups that where the 

358.52 362.94 B: of those of those of that or those particular countries dislike us 

363.10 374.84 A: but those those are the groups of people that are openly more open than my guess the other countries going out and saying death to america and such slogans like that that's why they stand out more i guess 

374.36 375.63 B: well 

375.91 381.30 B: perhaps and that's also more of what we see on the news 

381.40 392.67 B: and um i don't condone what they do at all but it's not to say that the people who don't voice their opinions a- you know aloud 

392.36 393.25 A: uh-huh 

393.17 395.93 B: ah don't harbour the same feelings 

396.19 402.79 B: sometimes and this is only sometimes sometimes those people are even worse because you don't even know what they're going to do 

402.45 409.70 A: yeah that that's that's very true i personally think the media is ah helping um 

405.07 405.84 B: (( you know )) 

409.73 412.96 A: helping i guess the people of the united states 

413.05 415.00 A: um support the war 

415.40 419.57 A: they they portray 'em in in a in a bad manner and i guess 

419.62 424.89 A: make us think that they're bad and they're out to harm us and so uh-huh 

424.55 434.63 B: well it's not to say that they're not out to harm us i'm just saying you know sometimes the ones you don't hear about are even more dangerous than the ones that you do 

434.74 441.82 B: and it is i i think that the media does play a big part in portraying ah 

442.30 450.47 B: [mn] those that perhaps the gov- the u._s. government isn't fond of ah and then you know to portray them in a negative light because that's all we see 

450.50 451.95 B: for the most part 

452.04 452.75 B: (( you )) 

453.01 453.87 A: yeah 

453.06 466.38 B: know when they report on those countries but you know there are places like north korea where in my opinion the leader of that country's out of his mind and ah you know he's not the only one you know excuse me there are places [mn] 

461.05 462.38 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

466.61 469.71 B: like china um where 

470.13 483.28 B: their their government isn't too fond of ours ah though it's very much an ec- economic thing now because china's been their economy's been booming if you follow that economic news do 

481.04 482.15 A: mhm 

483.04 484.38 A: (( yes yes i do )) 

483.79 490.82 B: you so you know their economy had been doing extremely well up until this sars event um 

489.54 490.39 A: uh-huh 

491.08 499.78 B: [mn] you know and years ago you know we were like their most ah hated enemy um in the world the thing is now 

499.91 501.91 B: we buy most of their products 

502.11 503.39 A: that's very true 

502.96 510.18 B: so before people will go and threaten another country most of the times now they consider the economic ah 

509.88 510.92 A: effects 

510.49 512.27 B: effects on us so 

512.50 513.74 B: um 

513.86 522.45 B: i don't think it's only countries in the muslim world that dislike the u._s. though though you're right i mean there are many that do but um 

517.10 517.97 A: okay 

522.79 524.06 B: [mn] there are many 

524.19 532.71 B: countries unfortunately around the world that dislike us and they dislike us for economic reasons and they dislike us for 

532.96 537.92 B: our openness and and and various factors and so ah 

538.04 540.40 B: i i wouldn't just 

541.18 543.28 B: ah pick one particular 

543.31 547.57 B: part of the world and isolate them and say they're the only ones who dislike us 

547.72 548.97 A: (( okay [mn] )) 

548.18 555.07 B: i think a lot of countries [laughter] unfortunate thing a lot of most countries probably dislike us i bet there are more countries that dislike us than like us 

554.28 556.26 A: than like us yeah 

555.66 564.46 B: so um but i i i can tell here in new york ah the economic damages that have happened since ah nine eleven 

563.91 565.28 A: mhm 

564.62 579.31 B: and um it's it's awful and you know i was out in san francisco a few years ago [mn] it's a great city too i'm just saying ah i could just imagine what kind of effect it's had on on people living there and here in new york 

579.36 586.88 B: you know it seems more much more div- diversified and we have a much larger economy here in new york and things have been awful 

583.69 584.79 A: uh-huh 

587.09 599.89 B: [mn] so you know um it's one thing to attack another country's military it's another thing to attack their psyche and their economic ah
