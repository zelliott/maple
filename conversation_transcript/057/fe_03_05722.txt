31.12 42.30 A: actually vietnam china and most of south korea but we never made it to china and vietnam 'cause of sars but we did go to south korea and i went all the way up to the d._m._z. 

42.15 43.24 B: yeah 

42.59 53.23 A: and i saw it's definitely a sketchy thing but the thing er about that they spend especially north koreans they've even admitted it there's already they spent almost like ninety per cent of their budget 

53.27 58.10 A: on their nuclear weapons and not nuclear weapons just but defense in general 

57.45 58.77 B: military huh 

58.16 65.85 A: yeah but er it was real sketchy just even having like it was just almost like a standoff right there and there's even so many troops there in south korea itself 

65.87 80.51 A: so i mean i definitely agree with you with that but the thing w- and that's another thing [mn] is that er even one of my teachers told me about ah north korea like a big thing about them is that they're like they can strike at so many different people like from their location 

65.91 67.64 B: (( y- [noise] [noise] )) 

80.73 81.90 A: so i mean 

82.04 84.62 A: that's definitely about those guys 

84.34 85.62 B: [noise] really 

84.99 87.77 A: (( yeah there's definitely a sketchy situation out there )) 

87.48 94.81 B: i i know in korea they already have it it is a pretty much they're staring at you right in the eye i mean they got like in the freeways 

93.59 94.54 A: yeah 

95.07 96.66 B: they have explosives 

96.75 98.05 A: yeah 

97.33 101.74 B: sort of big instant roadblocks 'cause the freeway goes directly to you know 

101.95 104.28 B: (( the what is it seoul korea )) 

103.62 113.31 A: yeah that's where i actually go- visited and even having em to started to discover tunnels built under that border that they can actually have the whole army 

110.24 111.41 B: oh really 

113.32 115.38 A: (( north korea is building these tunnels )) 

115.40 129.39 A: under the border that could just and they've only found like a couple of them which we're like when er when you go into the tour they don't let you take pictures because somehow they don't want them back into north korea 'cause then they'll find out which tunnels they do know about 

128.95 130.57 B: oh i see 

129.76 133.57 A: you know the implica- this is definitely gonna a sketchy situation 

133.43 138.95 B: so base- yeah so basically they're north korea's getting prepare to invade south korea 

138.06 150.91 A: right and and there's been a lot of troops there too even in seoul south i've met like a bunch of marines and there's like thirty seven thousand troops just in seoul and then there's like thirteen thousand through out there some down in pusson 

146.74 147.67 B: right 

151.45 156.06 A: also but that's definitely a sketchy situation but i don't even really think like 

156.75 164.48 A: like iraq or the middle east is really a threat to us at all i thought maybe at at first before but now i mean it really doesn't it looks kind of real bad 

164.30 171.71 B: i think the country iraq is not a threat any more but there are people still of course still around who are loyal to saddam 

171.38 172.57 A: (( yeah definitely )) 

172.46 178.52 B: who escaped i'm sure that they're gonna gonna em they're gonna w- 

178.67 180.44 B: meet up with some terrorist groups 

180.16 181.42 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

180.87 187.44 B: you know 'cause y- yeah you know the truth is that september eleventh was a major [mn] it was a major blow to us it was a major 

187.57 199.73 B: moral blow what are they trying to do i mean course they didn't do anything for the country itself it's they tried to hurt our mo- our morality not ah you know they're trying to

200.65 202.25 B: yeah it's er 

200.88 203.92 A: more of like a mental more of it's like almost a mental attack 

203.62 213.18 B: yeah it's a psychological attack of course we countered it by being stronger braver and everything but the thing is it's also great u- um 

213.63 215.68 B: because it's a great 

216.20 219.45 B: it it builds their confidence up you know 

219.50 233.93 B: er you have all these terrorists groups out there and they're like look what happened and of course going through the propaganda they can make it bigger than it really is so they're preparing um you got people all over in er in the persian 

219.51 220.78 A: (( like the [mn] )) 

222.28 223.27 A: yeah 

227.82 229.20 A: yeah 

233.80 236.17 B: countries as well as the arab countries 

235.75 237.10 A: yeah 

236.49 243.56 B: all in that area that and even in the philippines that know of it they're gonna plan something else 

243.61 244.46 A: yeah 

243.68 249.91 B: you know it's not like you say it's not rather what's if it's gonna happen but when where and how 

249.91 253.59 A: it's definitely sketchy definitely almost like unstable 

252.99 261.94 B: and what they're trying to do is they're gonna try to [mn] they're gonna try to outdo they're gonna try to make it bigger than what happened september eleventh em i'm 

261.31 263.44 A: (( yeah 'cause everyone was raising the bar you mean )) 

263.71 264.60 B: sorry 

263.76 268.60 A: kinda like are you you are you kind of saying like they've almost raised the bar by what 

268.62 271.70 A: like september eleventh they had like that monstrous attack 

271.43 273.18 B: they're gonna try and get bigger attacks 

272.71 274.52 A: yeah 

273.66 279.51 B: now of course there is when the soviet union union fell there's about a hundred 

279.66 283.88 B: sma- micro size small nuclear warheads that are missing 

284.10 286.06 B: (( noone knows where they're at )) 

285.80 286.87 A: yeah 

286.28 291.25 B: there's a threat there um it's not gonna destroy our country but it's gonna do a lo- 

287.52 288.64 A: that's sketchy [noise] 

291.37 293.77 B: a humongous amount of casualties 

293.43 294.63 A: yeah 

294.04 295.30 B: and um 

295.45 301.45 B: i mean you figure these people i mean they could go into south america and come up north you see 

301.09 302.36 A: yeah 

301.75 304.21 B: and em they'd try something you never know 

304.26 315.27 A: it's definitely an unstable situation there i mean before september eleventh like everything seemed like nothing was really wrong but after seeing that and then like everything's got real unstable with all these different 

315.29 328.01 A: like israel and palestine like everything definitely seems unstable i definitely agree with you i think it's definitely i think we're more aware of the threat from so i think going into iraq means that other people will still attack us more often 

327.50 341.34 B: [noise] [noise] [sigh] you're gonna get people who are gonna use that as a the iraq situation as fuel for a fire er basically to thing is that there is no such thing as security there's no such thing as you should never let your guard down 

333.80 334.68 A: yeah 

341.30 344.34 B: you look at history every time we let our guard down 

344.64 349.20 B: always something major like a major war broke out world war one 

347.71 348.54 A: yeah 

349.48 363.53 B: mm united states we had our guard down you know we're like oh whatever you know world war one broke out we called it the war to end all wars so we cut back on monetary spending after world war world war one and sure eno- sure enough here comes world war two 

363.44 364.53 A: yeah 

363.95 367.07 B: right after world war two korea after that vietnam 

367.29 373.58 B: you see um every time every time we say okay we're in peace let's 

367.30 368.48 A: yeah i know 

373.75 385.37 B: let's let's just put our guard down that's when they attack there's always a threat and there's always people out there even as large as that country itself there's gonna be people within those countries who are getting annoyed and be a threat to us 

381.34 382.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

385.64 392.80 B: er we're we are the biggest country the richest country the country with the greatest insolence in the world we're the only major superpower 

392.91 397.61 B: er that that fuels either er jealousy 

397.62 400.08 B: and envy or it fuels fear 

400.37 407.20 B: brings fear out these peop- they'll say americans are big and they're gonna come and take take over so everybody tries to counter us 

406.97 419.25 A: [mn] yeah yeah in south africa when they was talking about going into iraq and er a lot of south african people were like oh they're gonna come after us next because like of our we have like minerals or something like that 

411.15 411.82 B: mm 

415.42 416.31 B: yeah 

418.53 423.51 B: [mn] they got countries in africa they're on civil war you got people there 

422.99 424.16 A: yeah 

423.68 425.48 B: um i don't 

424.55 433.80 A: africa man that's all a mess i mean it's good i think with even i think that makes us look better by what bush is doing now and it's really true that these people really do need that help 

433.92 439.64 A: what we're doing in africa i mean that definitely helps out but as far as you're saying like with keeping our guard down do you think 

433.93 434.87 B: yeah 

440.47 447.19 A: like eventually like twenty years or thirty forty years do you think there will ever really honestly will be like a a true world peace 

447.06 447.81 B: no 

448.06 449.56 B: there will never be world peace 

449.80 457.13 B: i think er i don't think people can ever have world peace i think that's overly an optimistic view always gonna be some reason to have conflict 

457.17 458.15 B: always 

458.51 459.46 B: um 

458.63 465.23 A: wh- what do you mean i mean like not like what about like not like true world peace but not even like 

465.96 472.67 A: like maybe like there will be a civil war here and a civil war there within a country but nothing like now like bombings and like 

472.45 480.67 B: i i think the future will lead to more er dangers actually i mean dangers i mean you're gonna have more capabilities 

472.79 473.75 A: you know 

480.75 487.07 B: i mean for instance think about back in the nineteen forties how hard it was to make a nuclear warhead atomic bomb 

486.53 487.87 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

487.09 493.69 B: fifties came in with hydrogen bombs how hard it was only two major countries can do it um 

493.81 507.23 B: you they they're gonna around with uranium plutonium leaking everywhere and you have internet access you have people who will learn with super computers and technology available to make their own bombs twenty years from now it'll be even easier 

499.69 501.58 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

508.05 509.00 A: it's n- 

508.16 513.13 B: um and it mi- it might not be just nuclear bombs it'll be easier for them to make um ah 

513.38 514.67 B: um 

515.35 517.38 B: er biological and chemical weapons 

517.51 519.84 B: right now our biological weapons they're 

519.92 525.04 B: biological weapons are kind of iffy they're very fragile you never know what's gonna happen in twenty years from now 

525.02 527.85 A: what do you think about like the u._s. defense against that 

527.56 534.66 B: a defense i think it's gonna be very hard to defend it's always gonna be hard to defend against the terrorism 'cause it's hidden 

532.94 535.09 A: (( yeah 'cause you never know what's coming )) 

534.73 542.47 B: but you always have to try and bring your guard up er you should n- i don't believe you should ever relax on your military 

542.02 544.28 A: yeah what about as far as like 

542.57 543.36 B: um 

544.75 548.72 A: cutting back on like some aspects of military y- 

547.87 552.67 B: er i don't think it's a good idea er we always have the threat i mean look at history 

552.95 559.19 B: everybody every primiti- every civilization that's was really relaxed or military's gone 

559.83 561.69 B: you see um 

561.96 575.56 B: it's really still in this world it's still the survival of the fittest ev- no matter how civilized we become it's still survival of the fittest 'cause there's not enough resources to go around i mean you're gonna have rich people and you're gonna have poor people you can have rich countries and poor countries 

565.59 566.97 A: yeah that's true 

571.47 572.37 A: yeah 

575.61 588.23 B: you see and you gotta do what you gotta do to keep your em i mean even your rich countries have to compete with each other and rich companies have to compete with each other the idea of how strong you get is how you survive 

588.31 589.43 B: you see 

589.00 590.05 A: yeah 

589.56 590.58 B: um 

590.80 599.89 B: one corporation will go against another one and try and overcome that i mean when it's a country that way if you let your guard down it ru- being the richest country in the world lets our guard down an- an- and cuts back
