169.84 171.80 A: yep 

171.82 174.40 A: yep but 

175.02 182.35 B: th- gonna be part of everything t._v.'s going to be digital um there is gonna be no more ah 

177.44 180.02 A: (( yeah i yep )) 

182.40 194.22 B: you know like getting chan- your local channel through an antenna it's like why do that like you're gonna have a or- a high speed internet and you're gonna get your television and movies and all your entertainment and stuff like that 

193.91 195.08 A: yep 

194.05 201.51 B: through t._v. eventually things like movie theaters are gonna become obsolete as plasma screens get cheaper and cheaper 

198.51 199.46 A: yep 

201.08 202.29 A: yep 

201.54 211.26 B: everybody's gonna have a fifty fifty inch screen in their se- in their home and you're pretty much like ah on demand hit up a movie you know you've got to go to the video store and stuff like that anymore 

204.60 205.91 A: yeah exactly wi- 

208.77 209.69 A: (( [sigh] yep )) 

211.07 225.75 B: um i just think it's ah it's gonna make us lazier and it's gonna be a fat society ah in my opinion and it's already happened and i already hear that ah there's a high number of diabetes and overweight kids and stuff like that 

215.39 216.89 A: (( yep that's for sur- )) 

217.54 218.89 A: yep i mean 

219.89 220.86 A: yep

225.54 227.23 A: (( yeah )) 

225.60 235.87 B: um so i don't know there the a little bit scary um but definitely good but um the students might learn a little bit more but i really think that um 

229.54 231.01 A: yeah it 

231.34 233.63 A: (( it there's a li- )) 

236.09 238.69 B: [sigh] it's just sometimes like some of 

239.17 246.44 B: the [sigh] i don't know libraries just have to change i know with all computers generated and stuff like that and books are slowly 

241.44 242.56 A: yep 

246.42 255.45 B: being replaced by e books and things like that it's gonna be like star trek just you know buy a cartridge instead of a thing but um 

247.28 249.13 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

249.36 250.48 A: (( yeah )) 

253.42 254.61 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

255.12 263.86 A: i you know i i think you're right you know a lot of things you know as far as you know i think first of all they need to be taught how to do their research you know 

256.87 257.74 B: yeah 

262.67 264.50 B: (( right mm )) 

263.67 274.06 A: and then you know down the road w- w- when they get to college and stuff like that and you're paying for it i can understand doing your research you know through a computer and stuff like that you know 

271.86 283.95 B: oh there's nothing wrong with that and i mean like if i had the reporter if i had to write a report on anything and i have an ah access to a computer what am i going to go to the library for it's gonna take me long and i'm not gonna get as much information and yeah 

277.94 278.74 A: yep 

279.49 281.39 A: yeah exactly 

281.76 287.38 A: yep but when you're in school you know i think that's an important part of of learning 

285.69 293.39 B: yeah but i think i think things like that should be taught like you know like i said like you never know ah sooner or later 

288.69 290.41 A: yep 

293.48 296.89 B: there's gonna be some virus that's gonna f- knock out everything 

296.29 298.20 A: (( yep exactly )) 

296.99 299.26 B: i mean you see that in the future don't you 

298.73 300.28 A: [noise] oh yeah i mean 

299.18 307.43 B: like just some one idiot's gonna make a virus that's so good let's say everybody that has like windows x._p. is gonna be jerked 

302.16 304.05 A: yep 

306.73 307.95 A: (( yep )) 

307.26 314.49 B: simultaneously and it's gonna be like a history making thing like something like that is bound to happen sooner or later [mn] 

308.50 310.10 A: yep and that's the [noise] 

313.84 317.70 A: yep well [mn] nowadays i mean you know the new age terrorism and 

317.38 318.41 B: right 

317.71 324.57 A: all you have to do is really you know focus your attempts on computers i mean because the whole 

322.34 329.08 B: exactly exactly you can do so much damage yeah but um yeah i yeah 

325.35 327.41 A: yeah the whole world is so 

327.64 330.31 A: you know dependent on computers 

329.69 342.94 B: right that's why i'm so convinced that there's gonna be some virus that's gonna be something that's gonna be like oh wow i never thought about that like and really just do everybody wrong like you know i can just see a virus that just w- 

331.97 332.68 A: [sigh] 

333.99 335.31 A: yep 

340.26 341.95 A: (( yeah )) 

343.17 357.07 B: somehow just does everybody wrong that has a certain operating system some hidden something in in a popular operating system like microsoft or something like that i know like sooner or later within ten years there's gonna be something like that and it's gonna devastate everybody 

351.63 352.70 A: mhm 

356.18 358.57 A: [sigh] yep it is too i mean 

357.41 368.12 B: yeah it's gonna make the stock market crash everything like that can you imagine let's say everybody with ah windows ninety eight and x._p. just one day turn on the computer and ah you know 

359.74 361.85 A: [laughter] yeah i 

363.32 365.41 A: yep 

367.94 369.25 A: i mean 'cause that's 

368.20 369.81 B: the c. drive is empty 

369.46 372.94 A: the the more we depend on computers the more 

371.62 376.79 B: the more it's gonna hurt when something like that does happen and there's people that just sit around making viruses 

373.52 374.89 A: (( [noise] yep )) 

376.14 378.25 A: oh exactly i mean they make 

377.81 385.25 B: as smart as we think we are like there's always another one that comes out and like they'll do you wrong you know regardless of whatever fire walls or whatever you have

384.62 386.43 A: yep every day 

385.11 394.42 B: there could be some idiot let's say at microsoft like when they were making x._p. that puts some hidden commands in every every everything or something like that that he can just unleash at will 

388.78 389.74 A: yep 

391.18 392.04 A: yep 

393.67 397.14 A: yep yeah you get one disgruntled employee

397.32 398.11 A: (( yeah )) 

398.42 408.49 A: it's it's really it is it's almost it's almost one of those things where you could be sure of yep which is you know like i say i mean y- you hope that [sigh] you know that 

399.10 404.40 B: yeah yeah and ah it's gonna hurt it's gonna hurt it's definitely gonna hurt [noise] 

408.45 423.02 A: you know the whole society you know when it gets to that point you know will know what to do i mean the nice thing about it is is you know that we were brought up in kind of the world that you know if that kinda stuff happens we still have our coping skills where we ca- 

413.36 414.67 B: right yeah 

422.18 432.53 B: right yeah i can manage without a computer even though like i do use it everyday and i was watching a movie on my computer ah even when i got the call the whole deal so

438.76 447.41 B: right w- the last time i was in a library all the kids were doing was like fighting to get on the com- computers and stuff like that it's like jesus christ there's a whole ah 

439.17 440.62 A: you know they're gonna be 

441.81 442.70 A: [sigh] 

443.80 446.11 A: i know i know

452.62 453.72 A: (( no yep )) 

458.09 459.20 A: mhm 

458.25 462.81 B: like i just walked around looking at the books i didn't see anybody except me looking at a book 

461.88 467.55 A: [sigh] yeah there's a i mean i tell you one thing you know i enjoy sitting down and reading a book

490.75 492.37 B: yeah yeah 

491.12 496.53 A: you know i mean we're not gonna you know we're not gonna do it that way that is just yep [sigh] yeah 

494.29 503.52 B: it's very effective i mean of course i mean you could make a killer report if i had to do a report and i just like hit up a search and if i had to do a report on butterflies ah go to 

499.01 500.62 A: yep 

503.44 513.50 B: ah you know search engine type in butterflies b- b- b- boom i've got like enough to ah write a thesis paper better yet like if i just had to write a two page paper 

506.37 507.30 A: yep 

507.34 508.96 A: (( yeah )) 

513.45 522.24 B: um but to rely on that's a little bit much i think there should be like you know go read a book on butterflies go you know 

518.46 519.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

520.98 524.54 A: oh ah it's more you get more gratification out of it you
