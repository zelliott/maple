0.56 1.62 B: hello 

1.42 3.60 A: [noise] good evening my name is alex 

4.03 6.24 B: my name is doug how are you doing tonight 

5.69 7.80 A: i'm sorry can you speak a little louder please 

8.32 11.69 B: ah sorry my name is doug how are you doing tonight 

10.70 14.97 A: hello doug i shall cont- ah would you like to start the debate 

15.32 19.54 B: ah sure ah i didn't quite hear the topic can you repeat it for me 

19.30 25.70 A: ah yes it's about um how computers affect our education and should we use them or are they detrimental to our education 

26.49 28.11 B: what about education 

28.22 30.23 A: ah the use of computers 

30.22 31.91 B: oh computers okay 

32.81 42.82 B: um sure let's begin um i think that computers are very helpful in um education because they provide a learning tool um 

43.07 44.42 B: which ah 

44.48 48.81 B: [lipsmack] is more powerful than anything that has been ah previously um 

49.39 51.33 B: been used in the classroom before 

53.72 56.27 A: i agree to a point i think um 

56.30 59.26 A: they're both helpful and detriment- detrimental um 

59.43 63.02 A: i believe that they need to monitored um 

63.10 73.28 A: i believe ah the frameworks for ah doing things with with the paper i did it the old school way so but i'm i'm great with computers also and i find the computer is a great tool 

73.47 86.73 A: but i think if we use a computer to do homework and in our studies it kinda makes us lazy it's too easy to get it's too easy to find things and then you do it the old fashioned way it makes the brains a little more harder [noise] 

87.34 91.02 B: but in the real ah in the real world um 

91.18 101.95 B: we're always gonna try to use when it whether it be like at a job or doing research you're always gonna be use the most powerful tool available to you and so 

102.09 116.39 B: i mean if you can use a calculator to calculate you know lots of equations and rather than doing it by hand then that's gonna be more helpful in the real world and i do agree that sometimes it does promote laziness 

108.51 109.07 A: (( mm )) 

116.30 117.26 B: um 

117.50 126.77 B: and sometimes we forget the steps involved in in doing something because it's so easy but i think that um 

126.81 132.96 B: overall that if you have a more powerful tool to use then it's it's much better 

132.97 136.00 B: ah reflect what you would do in the real world 

136.61 145.86 A: i agree i in this modern day everything's so fast that um the computer is helpful or any electronic equipment that we use today um 

146.03 151.43 A: be it a simple calculator or be it a scientific calculator a computer even the phone 

151.36 154.35 A: um nowadays we have speed dial on our phones 

154.25 159.87 A: i don't think anybody really [lipsmack] um dials out of memory on their phone now unless they didn't program it in there [lipsmack] 

159.71 169.59 A: and most of the time you just do the speed dial thing [lipsmack] i agree it's um i'd i'm in modern day is ah it all consists of speed and ah ent- computers are not so time consuming [noise] 

171.65 174.48 B: um about ah the 

174.52 176.33 B: (( the the modern- )) 

176.49 179.61 B: modernization of computers um 

179.78 180.99 B: those 

181.88 191.01 B: if you take a school and [lipsmack] and ah take a school that doesn't have you know a lot of advanced computers and have their students you know work with 

191.07 195.68 B: you know like computers that are five year old five years old um 

196.05 201.56 B: i would say that those students tend to not do quite as well or not pick up on 

201.58 204.93 B: um as many things as like ah 

205.39 212.39 B: when they get out to either the real world or maybe up to college or somewhere where you know computers are stressed 

212.92 215.75 A: well let's see my granddaughter is eight years old 

215.78 223.15 A: ah she learnt everything the long way 'cause when she comes to live with me i have little workbooks for her but she gets on my computer also and she's great 

223.57 224.69 A: um 

224.85 226.44 A: but the problem is [noise] 

226.86 228.80 A: she doesn't want to 

229.15 232.03 A: if it's not she hates to read books 

232.23 235.59 A: ah she doing things the long hand way 

235.87 242.02 A: but she's magnificent on the computer it's so fast for her and she fascinated by it i think it's great it develops creativity 

242.82 249.07 A: but yeah it it promotes that annoyingness um at how to you know start from base one 

249.37 255.54 A: to the end and um i still think that's important nowadays if w- if we continue as we are 

255.57 258.71 A: um pretty soon we're gonna forget how what the basics are 

258.75 261.62 A: and we're just you know depending on the electronic [noise] 

263.91 265.85 B: well yeah of course you can ah 

266.61 274.78 B: it's i think it's up to the schools to emphasize both the basics and the advance um and the use of computers um 

275.47 279.42 B: as you say your granddaughter doesn't like to read books um 

279.59 281.69 B: i don't think that computers ah 

281.83 294.21 B: it's like television a lot of people a lot of parents ah blame television as a as um the lack of a child reading books and i don't think that's true because um 

295.42 298.38 B: i think um it's up to the the person 

298.47 310.42 B: um those who like to read will read those who like to watch t._v. will watch t._v. and the same thing with the television um back when it was new technology a lot of people thought it was you know um 

307.46 308.44 A: (( [noise] when )) 

310.66 312.72 B: it was like um it's 

312.73 315.15 B: (( i don't know what to say about it right right )) 

314.24 321.28 A: exactly it's like i said in the beginning i think the thing should be monitored ah there's a lot of great stuff in the t._v. and there's a lot of horrible stuff on t._v. 

321.63 322.77 A: um 

323.01 337.53 A: i watch a lot of educational programs wh- when my grandkids are here even when my kids are here i put on an educational program [noise] or if i watch a movie i watch something that they can learn from um i think it's all depending on who monitors and who's teaching 

337.82 342.84 A: um we all have to can learn from everything we do so um the basics 

343.03 346.79 A: are still involved to getting to where we are today [noise] 

348.16 353.21 B: as far as monitoring is concerned um i'm opposed to 

353.76 357.65 B: monit- like censor- censoring technology such as the 

358.11 361.14 B: and ah and on the internet fire walls 

361.33 363.63 B: um that blocks certain web pages 

363.71 365.13 B: i know why um 

365.15 366.49 B: i know that 

366.70 370.58 B: there are a lot of bad things you can explore on the internet and on t._v. 

370.89 379.98 B: but if you put a restriction on it there're gonna wonder what's out there you know um it's sort of like a reverse psychology of things and um 

380.47 388.90 B: of course it it won't block everything and so there's always loop holes around and and kids are gonna go find loop holes around those things i can do 

380.74 382.55 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

387.73 391.94 A: [noise] of course i mean you know if you say no they're gonna do it um 

390.95 392.18 B: (( that yeah all )) 

392.14 400.61 A: it's ah well again the whole principle again is you know is it's part of society and we have to you know let our kids know why we say no 

400.66 404.62 A: i believe truth is always you know the best [noise] ah teaching tool 

404.90 406.00 A: um 

406.10 410.22 A: no matter what we do no matter how you know we um 

410.19 415.37 A: try to [noise] protect our children when teaching them it's get- it it's best 

415.28 429.03 A: to have them know why we say no where this is not good at this time or no this is not ah this is not feasible at this time for you or until you get older or [noise] this could be detrimental to your learning or this can be 

429.06 433.82 A: a mind boggling thing that i have no answers for um 

433.94 438.03 A: and explain to your children about these things it's part of the education 

438.26 444.83 A: so um you know it's all part of today's times it's it's today's times is just moving fast [noise] 

445.64 448.69 B: right i agree on that um 

448.92 456.91 B: yeah it pretty much is if kids are gonna explore they'll run into bad things and it's up to the parents to teach them 

456.98 458.50 B: you know wh- which 

458.75 469.76 B: what is good and what is bad i guess if you wanna um put in those two categories um but yeah eventually they'll they'll find the bad path and it'll be up to the 

469.86 474.33 B: parents to teach their kids um which way to cho- choose 

475.56 483.05 A: [noise] well i believe that in well let me say how shall i say this the older you get the more you should move with technology [lipsmack] um 

483.35 486.61 A: even today i'm still learning about new stuff um 

486.86 490.66 A: i'm i'm always creative on on the computer i teach my kids how to be crea- 

490.87 494.20 A: creative um i have 

494.48 502.73 A: i don't have an argument with technology i have an argument in how we teach our kids what the technology ah the we forget about the simple things 

498.94 499.52 B: (( mm )) 

502.78 504.12 A: and the 

504.20 506.92 A: (( oh ho- how i say um )) 

507.78 514.62 A: the fascination of new things all their fascination in new things makes our children learn i'm not going to argue about how we go about it [noise] 

515.05 516.68 B: right 

516.73 522.74 B: ah i don't know i'm i come from a very computer savvy background and so a lot of things i say 

522.93 526.75 B: it tow- tends to lean towards the computer because that's that's you know 

526.91 528.90 B: where my comfort is um 

529.07 537.14 B: i don't know um if you have the same background but i think that some people who are sort of afraid of the computer um 

536.98 551.69 B: they tend not to do as well i would say in the workforce and other things in life just because um they're afraid of something that's new and big and they're not sort of getting with the times as you could say 

553.27 557.78 A: i agree i agree if you if you if being in um in new york 

558.00 559.59 A: to ah argue 

559.71 566.55 A: in teaching why even even have adults an- and as long as they continue to produce everything and introduce 

566.48 576.51 A: new media um we become fascinated um although i find the older we get the more we become somewhat fearful of technology 

576.71 577.73 A: um 

577.77 587.02 A: i've taught computers for a while [noise] and i realize that the older we get the more fearful we get of same things especially men 

587.09 589.59 A: um women are more acceptable 

589.95 593.47 A: um to learning um [noise] technology 

594.51 599.89 A: and as children i see more jump into it so you know it it works in in
