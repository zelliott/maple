0.00 1.20 A: steve 

1.19 3.92 B: hi my name's tate how you doing 

3.19 4.53 A: pretty good 

4.43 8.41 B: so what do you what do you think about uh computers and education 

8.15 15.83 A: oh i think if used correctly they could really implement like opportunities in the classroom but 

15.89 27.40 A: like a a lot i feel that a lot of schools don't have the money for them and even if they do they buy these new fancy computers and they're not even used the teachers themselves don't know how to use them 

27.16 32.80 B: so they're not actually getting as much as possible out of these computers that they are able to afford 

32.17 33.53 A: yeah that's correct 

33.98 40.54 B: [mn] do you do you think that uh if taught properly though they are a useful education aid or 

40.12 43.02 A: oh definitely there's so many programs 

43.06 47.56 A: and different aspects of it that can really engage your children 

48.33 57.41 B: and what do you feel about the fact that not everyone's able to afford the computers do you think that what d- how do you think it would be possible to [sigh] 

57.35 63.45 B: level the playing field between people that are receiving the proper education and people that aren't 

63.99 65.10 A: um 

64.07 64.88 B: (( str- [noise] )) 

65.12 74.39 A: that's a tough question maybe more f- more funding from the state and the federal government but that's always a question of taxes 

74.69 75.83 A: um 

75.91 80.81 B: because i've been reading about uh bill gates recent uh computer initiatives 

80.81 82.06 A: mhm 

80.85 90.30 B: with- within youth centers and how they're trying to make the computers available for everyone and that's it's a lofty goal and it's a it's a good goal to have but 

90.40 103.24 B: the fact is that these people are learning computers at the youth centers are not going to be as skilled as those that are going to an expensive private school and receiving adequate teaching 

102.64 104.01 A: that's true 

104.11 105.15 A: um 

106.26 109.85 A: i don't know maybe maybe even even doesn't have to be like 

109.71 123.40 A: a computer like in every classroom but if the children have like a computer lab they go to frequently and are taught by an actual computer teacher what they can do on it i'm sure that could help them more too and not as it's not as expensive 

122.79 130.74 B: right what do what do you think are the uh important skills for someone to learn using a computer 

130.44 137.01 A: well word processing definitely because th- th- that will help you out on all levels but um 

137.60 143.55 A: like multiple intelligence is different children are better at different things and are interested in different things 

143.69 153.99 A: and technology is one often ignored in education systems so it could help students that are having trouble learn something the traditional way i- 

154.22 156.99 A: it'll be easier for them to learn over a computer 

156.89 169.29 B: right and they're even though they might not be able to afford travel to europe or a foreign continent they might be able to learn about it through the internet which would be useful so 

167.74 169.50 A: [noise] yeah yeah they i- 

170.14 176.84 A: it's more like a break from the traditional prescribed ways and it it's more reality 

176.75 180.42 B: right now do you think that uh computers are 

180.68 194.04 B: s- say there's limited funding in the uh public school education system do you think it's more important than a well taught history class or a well taught english class [mn] i'm i'm not sure where where i 

194.16 200.44 B: have uh placed computer education in terms of it's important with the core curriculum 

200.47 201.36 A: (( mm )) 

202.33 203.98 A: (( well i don't th- )) 

204.28 205.42 A: the- 

205.49 218.19 A: there should definitely be emphasis on like the the core curriculum like th- the history and english but computers shouldn't m- the computer class shouldn't be like a separate thing it should be incorporated in with the other ones it's because 

218.09 220.81 A: [noise] it's it's relevant to each field 

220.34 232.64 B: [noise] that's a that's that's good idea it should be combined with the core curriculum 'cause i remember when i was being taught computers at first uh it was completely separate entity i- 

221.63 222.39 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

225.85 226.97 A: yeah 

232.02 233.62 A: yeah same for me 

233.14 236.06 B: it was i would go to the classroom and they would 

236.15 242.93 B: make me program something extremely basic and make like a turtle move across the stre- the screen 

239.82 240.78 A: mhm 

243.86 252.51 B: in basic and all these other programs but i think that would be useful to the kids to have as part of the curriculum 

249.83 251.74 A: [noise] yeah all i 

251.91 256.68 A: all i remember doing in computer lab is playing oregon trail like that was [noise] like a [noise] 

255.72 259.41 B: oh i remember playing oregon trail in in classroom too 

259.29 262.70 A: yeah th- that's that's i think that's all we did in computer lab 

262.30 270.53 B: [laughter] not exactly useful but i completely agree with what you were saying about uh word processing being the main skill to be 

264.76 265.63 A: no 

270.46 279.51 B: focussing on if if you don't have the money to do anything further because that would enable [sigh] someone to get a job with those skills 

279.07 283.67 A: yeah and and help 'em even in like in in their other classes 

283.30 285.08 B: right 

283.91 285.67 A: and in future education 

286.22 287.57 B: right 

287.38 291.29 A: and or maybe like typing skills too maybe they can do with typing 

290.66 297.56 B: [sigh] what do you feel about online education like uh the courses that are being offered now 

297.51 304.36 B: like phoenix university and other classes where the courses are taught completely online i mean 

304.24 312.71 B: i personally don't feel that that's as good a education that you receive as compared to having a a live teacher interacting with students 

312.77 322.09 A: yeah i'm i'm not very familiar with that i'm not sure what they do but [noise] i i i can't see it being as a good a educational experience either because 

322.93 324.08 A: either the 

324.48 328.41 A: the there's like no motivation you know th- you're not actually in the classroom 

328.03 329.43 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

328.84 334.27 A: and so it's not like you're being watched it's not like the teacher cares if you're there 

334.56 340.82 B: questions extremely informal and might not even be exactly what you were asking 

337.42 338.85 A: yeah 

340.87 350.08 B: the only advantage i see to it and i've yet to take one i probably won't ever take one the only advantage i see to it is it does bring the cost down significantly [noise] 

345.27 346.21 A: mhm 

349.42 351.68 A: [noise] oh okay yeah 

351.88 361.47 B: however i i don't know if employers would view an online education in nearly the same light as a real education 

352.58 353.57 A: but 

360.75 365.69 A: that's true i didn't think about that but huh 

366.24 370.02 A: but i guess it's better than nothing for the people that can't afford 

370.30 373.07 A: private universities and colleges [noise] i- i- 

372.78 374.58 B: right 

375.05 377.98 B: and wh- how do you feel uh computers 

378.10 388.65 B: work in terms of if someo- if if a child growing up spends too much time on the computer [sigh] do you feel that person is getting the same kind of education 

388.69 403.32 B: maybe twenty years ago where computers barely existed that the person was outside more and learning things more personally compared to learning things through running search engines [noise] [noise] [noise] 

404.09 412.44 A: i- it is a different com- uh completely different kind of education but i- it this is also a completely different time period but um e- e- 

412.86 420.69 A: each like like i said earlier each child is interested in different things and if the computer is what's that is what that ch- child wants to do 

420.86 429.40 A: it should be encouraged [noise] but all all different avenues should be explored but if this if that's what it wants to do then 

422.26 423.26 B: right 

429.50 430.91 A: go for it 

431.30 438.01 B: d- do you think there's a fundamental difference though between learning how to build 

438.64 444.35 B: a a a house online and then learning to build something in person 

444.09 446.37 A: oh there's definitely a difference 

446.69 461.46 B: [sigh] so i don- i don't know how to education is going to counteract that if computers ever get to the advanced point where say it replaces woodshop however i never participated in a woodshop class 'cause i'm from new york but 

447.16 448.23 A: like 

460.87 462.87 A: oh i did i'm from new york too 

463.15 465.09 A: we we had one in middle school 

465.38 476.87 B: i don't know if they will completely replace that that instead of having them learn how to do something online but i think that would be i think that would hinder a child's growth 

477.01 484.23 B: maybe not in the core curriculum sense but just in terms of developing a skill set that is useful 

483.66 493.27 A: mhm well like e- even with like woodshop i'm i know like in actual manufacturers or factories uh er like 

493.62 499.43 A: i don't know m- i can't think of anything off the top of my head but it's not like computers aren't used there 

499.10 500.82 B: right 

499.88 506.27 A: so like even with a woodshop class the computers can be incorporated and still have the hands on stuff 

506.18 507.30 B: that's true 

507.76 522.65 B: and cars have become completely computerized at this point where i'm sure that any auto body class that they're taught in high school if they didn't implement computers they really wouldn't be teaching them much of a skill anymore 

521.98 524.24 A: that's true yeah 

523.29 526.26 B: unless they wanted to work on old cars 

526.21 530.22 A: yeah like they would they would need the electrical and the mechanical skills now 

530.25 532.00 B: right 

532.17 533.35 B: (( so i don't know )) 

533.42 534.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

534.21 537.53 B: how did you uh find out about this survey 

537.40 539.14 A: uh craig's list 

538.81 540.76 B: that's how i found out about it too [laughter] 

540.30 541.72 A: (( oh okay [noise] )) 

542.11 543.08 A: yeah 

543.45 545.86 A: figured it's easy money so why not 

544.71 551.51 B: yeah it it sounded pretty good i i haven't really done one of these surveys before but it it sounded pretty easy to me [laughter] 

548.26 549.71 A: this is my first one 

551.47 552.30 A: [laughter] 

553.23 557.46 B: but i don't know i guess we have like a minute and a half longer to talk 

557.14 559.29 A: okay um [mn] 

557.89 558.61 B: (( [noise] )) 

560.92 566.91 A: li- like how do how do you think computers affected your education like did they at all did you have computers in your classrooms 

566.57 580.80 B: um we had a computer in our class when i was growing up but nothing terribly significant i i basically learned all my skills in college and i guess our departments weren't large enough at college because 

580.91 594.71 B: there was only about twenty four seats for a c- an intro to computer science class and i was never able to get into them so i think we still have a ways to come in terms of accessibility even at good institutions 

594.27 596.05 A: yeah 

595.21 597.40 B: but how how did they affect you 

597.15 599.89 A: uh i don't remember well i always had a
