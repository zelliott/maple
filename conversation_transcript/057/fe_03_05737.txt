21.11 28.29 A: uh you know i think somehow they should be monitored you know they shouldn't be able to go uh porn sites and you know 

21.14 21.88 B: i think 

28.31 33.57 A: stuff like that but uh as long as they stay in the proper parameters 

33.94 35.27 A: [lipsmack] i think it's great [noise] 

35.74 38.41 B: [lipsmack] yeah i couldn't agree with you more um 

38.65 44.52 B: yeah i'm from the old school and we didn't have computers until uh college and uh you know 

43.09 45.03 A: nah you're kidding i know 

44.49 54.96 B: and my uh i mean i'm a little bit proficient with computers but my kids i have three little kids i mean they've they've started learning com so- started with computers since uh 

54.97 62.86 B: kindergarten and today i mean one's in lower school and two are in middle school they work the computer like i work a t._v.'s clicker 

55.75 56.80 A: right 

62.24 63.67 A: (( [noise] right )) 

63.11 77.32 B: it's um i mean it gives them a wealth of uh you know opportunity unfortunately i agree with you there with uh you know sometimes it's got to be monitored because i caught my little one on a chatroom once chat making a chat to somebody and i was pretty upset about it 

73.32 74.45 A: right 

76.35 79.38 A: yeah 'cause i mean you know you don't know who they're chatting to 

79.24 80.56 B: (( [mn] i know )) 

79.67 85.65 A: i mean they you know they say they can be this and you know they could be totally whoever they want to be o- when they're online 

86.46 90.89 A: [noise] so it's you know you i guess you have somehow draw a line somewhere [noise] 

90.68 94.54 B: yeah unfortunately where my kids go to school last year um 

94.59 98.90 B: one of the most popular teachers um i remember he was like a superstar teacher 

98.77 111.12 B: one of the kids went into his classroom after class and uh he walked away and he l- he looked at the screen and there was a porn site the teacher was looking after hours on a porn site and um 

109.48 110.99 A: (( mhm mm )) 

111.67 119.80 B: the kid's father comes into school and just happens to pick him up and sees the porn site and reports him the guy gets fired immediately and uh 

119.76 127.21 B: i didn't think it was right for him to get fired i mean what he does is his on own time it was stupidity what he did was uh forgot to turn it off 

126.67 127.90 A: right 

127.32 130.78 B: i mean he was such a dynamic teacher and they they canned him 

130.57 135.83 A: right i mean that's all he did he didn't go to the site he like you said he just forgot to turn it off and 

134.97 137.63 B: yeah [laughter] so you got to be w- 

136.22 137.10 A: (( you know [noise] )) 

137.42 151.33 B: careful i mean uh we had to evening hour meetings concerning uh computers all last year because of the uh conflict this uh what this creates so [sigh] you know we we had to educate 'em our way 

151.25 164.65 B: concerning the pros and cons and how to turn off sites and you know uh what the kids should do and shouldn't do on the computer so um like a real education on uh the dos and don'ts of computers that's for sure 

159.10 160.12 A: right 

164.60 171.48 A: right i mean i think it's great they can go to any search engine and they can pretty much find anything about any subject there is 

171.76 180.79 B: yeah when i grew up i needed a uh the encyclopedia you know you know and i have an old one and my kids never even open it up everything they want they can get there 

174.29 176.55 A: -pedia britannica right exa- 

178.35 179.68 A: right 

180.79 188.58 B: they had the site where they can get the encyclopedia the dictionary everything is you know uh just a click away 

186.62 192.88 A: any ma- any i know any map anywhere how to get anywhere i mean pretty much anything [noise] 

192.77 199.59 B: and these kids today they make some impressive book reports and stuff i mean they they email homework to the teacher they uh 

199.81 206.68 B: they uh you know they they chat with their friends i mean with their homework assignments everything is done through the computer 

206.09 207.26 A: right 

207.50 212.19 B: and it's just a question with three kids they got they fight on who's getting the computer time 

211.74 213.13 A: exactly 

212.33 214.14 B: (( [laughter] that's about it )) 

214.12 225.03 A: yeah i mean i think they just have so much more access to so much more information now than we ever had and i mean it's all out there just uh click on it and there it is 

224.41 227.06 B: yeah the old information highway 

226.63 227.65 A: i know 

227.89 232.40 B: so i you know definitely think it's a you know it's a plus that the education i mean 

232.84 234.67 B: um it's a good thing [noise] 

234.32 238.11 A: yeah i yeah i mean i don't see anything bad about it 

238.12 247.06 A: you know unless they get into things like porno sites and you know chatrooms and stuff like that you know they can get wh where are you where do you live where am i talking to you

267.38 270.76 B: yeah in in case unless they call you back uh 

271.03 280.79 B: like they the last two topics were on uh the war and uh government so this is a little different with the education which i think is a great topic [sigh] 

280.79 293.20 B: it's just getting so expensive the colleges here my kids go to private school and uh i mean they get charged for their uh d- um their for the private school but there's also a computer charge too 

293.05 294.23 A: oh wow 

293.40 301.45 B: uh for uh the technical use of computers and everything it's like about a h- about two hundred bucks a kid just for the use of computers 

300.89 302.18 A: that's a lot 

301.62 313.11 B: yeah and maintenance or whatever they used to make a la- [sigh] they have a lady in the school that's totally you know involved with uh monitoring computers make sure there's no uh hanky panky going on 

302.87 303.87 A: right 

311.96 315.81 A: right well that's good then i mean at least that's where some of the money should go 

316.19 318.86 A: to make sure they're getting the best out of it [noise] 

318.85 327.63 B: yeah i think today without the use kids need to know computers i mean it's so important you can't do in any kind of business or anything without these computers 

319.33 320.08 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

327.05 340.43 A: no i mean a lot of times you you y- y- you can't do anything without a computer i mean you know i know different people that they're trying to do some business or whatever they have to go to a site they have to be able to use a computer i mean it's totally you know 

337.34 338.65 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

340.36 342.19 A: a necessity these days 

342.84 354.85 B: yeah the computer does impact a lot of industries and has destroyed a lot of industries [laughter] people use a computer as you know as opposed to um you know using a live human being 

347.91 348.95 A: i know 

354.95 364.72 A: i know that's that's kind of the down the down side of it you know we've become somehow de- dehumanized a bit during the whole computerized thing 

365.03 368.11 A: there must i guess there's some happy medium somewhere 

368.03 375.68 B: [sigh] i hope so because uh you know a lot of people are losing their jobs unless you're a computer wizard uh which i'm not um 

373.61 375.11 A: (( e- exactly )) 

375.82 387.33 B: [sigh] you know uh you lose a lot of opportunity there's no um you know uh customer service no uh one on one it's just just going right to the computer you can do and buy and do and everything you need

423.00 423.91 A: so 

423.17 437.00 B: yeah 'cause i see in my my uh business with the kids coming out of college i mean they're like such computer wizards it's unbelievable they're so you know um used to using a computer in college like i mean it's like a major major necessity 

430.51 431.50 A: i know 

436.39 442.09 A: right so you know i think every school should have computers 'cause it's the way the w- 

440.91 446.38 B: i think they do i don't know any of the others that doesn't you know public school or private schools [noise] 

442.76 443.66 A: right 

443.71 450.77 A: i mean it's the way of the world y- right so it's uh it's definitely important it's definitely a necessity right now 

451.31 452.35 B: yeah 

451.57 453.23 A: with- without a doubt 

453.31 455.04 B: (( [sigh] it's just uh )) 

455.01 462.58 B: what's uh amazing in this is you go buy a new computer or you go buy a new monitor or go buy a new uh server [noise] 

462.42 474.07 B: and you turn around it's outdated already [noise] i mean you buy something and then you know it's it's you know the value just shoots right down because they come up with bigger and better every month 

473.43 477.44 A: true but at least getting into it now is not as expensive as it used to be 

476.87 478.67 B: no that's true too it um 

477.52 480.50 A: i mean you can buy for four five hundred dollars a decent computer 

480.11 484.54 B: [noise] yeah you can get a whole system whereas you know years ago it was in the thousands 

480.51 481.41 A: where you cou- 

481.90 485.36 A: (( yeah [mn] exactly so )) 

485.19 488.85 B: but that thousands of dollars computer ain't worth crap any more [laughter] 

488.20 490.28 A: oh no that's a dinosaur i know 

490.99 492.13 A: i know [noise] 

492.34 507.02 B: yeah 'cause when you're in business you have to constantly upgrade i mean y- y- y- you need more and more memory and more and more space [noise] because everything gets put in there and then you have to back up because god forbid something happens to that computer you lose the total total database 

506.46 511.53 A: oh i know i'm not very good on backing up anything [laughter] [laughter] [noise] 

509.18 523.54 B: no one is i just bought a new server that uh supposedly has automatic back up in it 'cause i got like five gigabytes in it and uh now it- it'll back itself up because i'm always forgetting to uh to back up 

521.00 522.42 A: oh that's good then 

522.63 525.20 A: that's that's that's a pretty good feature 

523.96 532.06 B: it's just an automatic back up for any kind of you know uh the software we run on all our databases everything is automatically backed up 

529.04 530.15 A: (( right [noise] )) 

532.26 533.86 A: right that's really 

532.91 534.90 B: which is a nice thing 

535.23 539.33 A: that's pretty good so how long we been talking here do they tell us when it's over or 

538.59 550.09 B: yeah they'll they'll give us a uh th- uh somebody you know the computer will come on like that old computer will come on and say your time's up you have thirty seconds to say 'goodbye' and then uh 

550.31 559.86 B: you know uh you just hang up and you can go on to your s- next one see each days they change the topic so i wouldn't suggest doing this 'cau- 'cause you'll repeat the conversation uh 

555.16 556.37 A: right 

558.97 567.13 A: exactly you know they they're been calling me you know the computerized caller's been calling me like every day i just haven't been around 

560.13 561.58 B: (( [noise] )) 

566.38 567.75 B: oh okay 

567.32 571.71 A: but you know i come home and i see on my my answering machine they're always calling [mn] 

571.76 585.85 B: [noise] okay they've never called me except to you know to tell me you know you're um you know here's your number here's what you got to do and [sigh] i just you know and they called me two day- three days ago and this is the third you know what i'm doing and so i you know should be complete now 'cause you're only allowed three 

585.23 588.10 A: right and then they just send you a check for thirty dollars 

587.44 592.22 B: yeah and then we're completed and wait for the next uh you know opportunity 

591.65 593.34 A: right that's not bad 

593.08 596.01 B: no i think it's uh it's a good thing 

596.06 599.89 B: so for ten minutes talk about computers as though it- it- it- it's a good d-
