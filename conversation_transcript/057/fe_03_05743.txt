0.08 1.79 A: my name is sheldon 

1.39 3.71 B: hi sheldon my name's eric 

3.49 4.71 A: (( how are you )) 

4.28 6.68 B: i'm doing great where are you calling from 

6.08 8.68 A: i'm calling from philadelphia pennsylvania 

8.44 9.41 B: oh great 

9.33 10.42 A: how about you 

9.53 12.93 B: [mn] i'm out in uh south jersey so we're not too far 

12.66 14.62 A: (( oh right [mn] )) 

13.71 16.27 B: yeah did you um 

16.52 18.82 B: so what do they want computers in education 

18.54 20.08 A: yeah 

19.51 20.45 B: (( hm )) 

20.10 35.05 A: yes i'd uh i have a computer and i think uh computers in education are a good idea and um it creates a lot of creativity but there's a problem there's a some kids graduate 

34.96 36.21 A: um 

36.38 51.24 A: h- college and high school and they can't do simple math and fr- and fractions and i think [sigh] they should also that is the problem i think they should also learn the basic skills of doing math and fractions [sigh] and algebra by hand 

39.30 40.25 B: right 

51.20 60.29 B: [lipsmack] no i agree um i'm thirty six years old so i we there weren't computers in the classroom you know [laughter] when i was growing up and um 

57.67 58.72 A: (( mhm )) 

60.40 74.43 B: you're right you need basic [noise] [sigh] skills as to just like you say fractions percentages things you have to do just in everyday life you know just to to figure the value of something or the worth of something [mn] you don't always have a computer on your hand you know 

68.93 69.49 A: (( [mn] )) 

74.28 76.02 A: mhm 

74.59 86.70 B: um i do agree with you though that it does open up [sigh] um [noise] vast information source that uh you know especially the internet i mean that's just incredible um 'cause literally there's nothing you can't learn or find you know 

86.50 87.76 A: right 

86.93 97.06 B: and that as a resource i mean that can can you imagine being a [mn] a kid you know back in high school doing a an essay paper or something and and actually having that resource at your fingertips you know 

96.94 97.50 A: (( [mn] )) 

97.21 101.08 B: god we had to run to the library and pull books and do all this kind of stuff which 

101.32 107.70 B: [mn] you know was was kind of uh charming of itself i suppose but boy there's so much more information available don't you think 

107.47 119.09 A: well i agree it's uh man it's fascinating how you can communicate with other people and uh and different parts of the world and um 

119.34 126.03 A: you know we could um get ideas and opinions from other people even the fact that the email 

126.01 139.18 A: i- is fascinating by itself it i mean you can actually communicate with other people but um i mean it's a good learning tool but um it has it's drawbacks too 

138.98 140.31 B: sure [sigh] 

140.36 144.74 B: yeah it um and also you know th- there's a social thing too i mean you just 

144.74 156.47 B: kids that come home and just play on computers all day long you know um you know they get so familiar and so used it and it integrates such a large part of their life [mn] you know whatever happened to just going outside and playing ball you know [laughter] 

147.63 148.82 A: (( [noise] right )) 

152.60 153.62 A: mhm 

156.29 157.40 A: right 

156.56 161.43 B: grabbing some buddies and going out and just doing something outside in the fresh air i don't know [mn] 

161.64 169.26 B: it seems like there's a lot of that where you know there's not a lot of exercise in young kids which leads to weight problems later on et cetera et cetera you know 

169.04 170.73 A: mhm 

169.33 176.63 B: more of a sedentary lifestyle which in fact we all lead you know um at some point um what do you 

174.98 179.27 A: (( right yeah like um uh computers are good and um )) 

180.07 185.93 A: uh you know i wish that uh well you figure kids should go out and exercise more and play 

185.94 187.55 A: but uh 

187.85 197.22 A: um but you know it's it has it's uh it's good at for education and it has it's limits but uh 

197.30 197.96 A: (( you )) 

197.95 212.80 A: know um it ha- it's good for information but uh and it's good education but we should still learn like the math skills and stuff like that fractions and some kids can't even do uh simple math can't even 

212.76 223.18 A: um calc- you know pa- fa- can't even do percentages and and it's it's that's the disadvantage of it they should they should 

223.21 228.88 A: do less of computering and more of the basic math uh solving problems 

228.60 229.50 B: mhm 

228.89 240.83 A: because we like go out to measure things with a yardstick or a ruler they don't they don't know how to do that they don't know what a yard is uh they don't know how to measure it the calculator does all the work for them 

240.04 242.25 B: yep i agree [laughter] 

243.00 245.35 B: did you um did you graduate 

245.37 246.77 B: school high school 

246.38 250.12 A: yes i graduated back in the sixties 

249.58 250.63 B: okay 

250.07 259.50 A: there were and uh late sixties and we had you know we i learned in in high school in junior high school to use uh 

259.40 272.00 A: math uh calculators were available but we had to use uh we couldn't even use adding machines we had to use [mn] we had long division and short division and fractions and percentages 

272.11 274.58 A: write on paper and um 

274.90 287.49 A: uh formulas write on paper and algebra that way too because we don't a- and it was hard to do uh square roots or squares where you had to use a piece of paper and uh 

287.41 294.15 A: and and and figure out which is uh how to divide fractions and right now with uh 

294.25 307.16 A: you know the kids don't learn that stuff and that's really important for them just to learn that basic thing and algebra the computers are handy to have um but like they should still learn the basic math problems so 

298.66 299.99 B: mhm 

306.99 315.23 A: hopefully th- th- the educational system will go back to uh teaching kids the basics uh fundamentals of math 

315.00 318.95 B: mhm did you um are you currently working 

318.48 319.70 A: yeah 

319.09 323.35 B: what do do you use math like that on your feet a lot 

322.56 328.21 A: y- yes uh well yeah i do i do it's fractions pretty much 

328.23 337.93 A: uh when i have to do my time sheet at the end of the day and um i'm on the computers too and there's there's a calculator there but uh 

337.91 348.01 A: i prefer not to use the calculator because there's a calculator on my computer too and i i'd rather use the basic math and figure it out [mn] you know when you want like 

339.97 341.29 B: mhm 

345.97 346.96 B: mhm 

347.95 356.43 A: like tenths of of of an hour fractions of an hour and um basic- basically that's what we do 

356.18 357.83 B: (( hm )) 

356.62 358.01 A: (( uh )) 

358.22 371.15 A: but uh like i say at home when i have to measure a piece of wood i can't go to a uh can't use a calculator i have to use a ruler and like measure the wood and figure out a repes- you know i mean 

371.08 378.16 A: (( one twelfth of an inch a quarter of an inch uh half of an inch you know a lot of kids don't know how to do that )) 

373.61 374.93 B: right 

377.50 380.01 B: nope that's true 

378.83 379.39 A: (( [mn] )) 

379.94 381.91 A: it's sad for them 

380.37 383.37 B: mhm mhm 

383.67 389.57 B: the um i guess the other flipside um as far as you take it a little bit further of education i guess 

389.66 398.11 B: you know architects engineers and such can actually design with computers now you know um you know the more high tech things in aviation and what have you 

393.91 395.79 A: right 

398.04 404.91 B: um as as a tool you know not necessarily as a learning device but as a as a tool i guess that is a big beneficial 

398.17 399.88 A: mhm 

405.44 414.56 A: right th- the that's come in handy it it probably saves time and um and especially with architecture perhaps it [mn] 

414.53 427.84 A: where they measure uh stress on on uh design when design buildings like they check the stress uh of of where should i put should put the beams or the supports 

427.84 430.66 A: um and exactly what i should do if they 

431.00 442.27 A: like um if they do it you know by measuring they might make a mistake and they might put the um the stress on the wrong spot and the structure could collapse 

435.75 437.50 B: mhm 

441.60 443.51 B: mhm 

442.51 446.36 A: you know like um i think they've built a a bridge in 

446.45 455.73 A: seattle galloping gertie and it wasn't designed well because it was of because of the wind blowing the structure sideways 

455.18 456.51 B: mhm 

455.52 467.15 A: and they didn't have the technology and then well they well they built a model that really wasn't realistic and um the building uh literally fell apart 

466.63 467.35 B: (( mm )) 

467.18 481.53 A: so i think with the computers it saves a lot of uh aggravation with poor design time and uh energy in material spent uh plus money spent just by designing it that way 

481.07 482.95 B: mhm 

481.94 488.59 A: um so if i- architecture but uh g- what's that an architect has to uh 

488.70 494.87 A: you know uh figure if his client is is trying to save money and um 

495.00 501.88 A: that's the good that's a good aspect but uh so that's basically what i think 

501.56 505.66 B: mhm no i agree there [mn] um 

505.91 510.41 B: what um what do you do that you have to think on your feet like that 

509.53 514.01 A: well i work for the government and the federal government and uh 

514.19 528.20 A: i'm on the terminals all the time and we have a time sheet we have to fill out at the end of the day and uh we have to use the fractions fractions of an hour and figure it out and hand it in 

524.62 526.36 B: mhm 

528.24 530.75 A: it's not basically with a computer 

530.71 544.01 A: but we have to do that we basically have to get a pencil and add up your fas- figures and stuff like that and so i use use a pencil and do it the old fashioned way i can't use a computer 

536.46 538.31 B: mhm 

541.56 543.35 B: mhm 

543.95 551.03 A: to a- add up the figures but um i could technically but it it's exercise 

551.21 559.51 A: uh by using the comp- by using your head and um with a pencil and figuring it out like when i build things 

557.40 559.20 B: mhm 

559.51 567.07 A: uh with wood in m- in my house i use a ruler i measure things out um but [lipsmack] 

564.32 566.08 B: mhm 

567.23 575.95 A: that's what i like but i do still think that computers i mean have the drawbacks and they have their advantages either way 

575.58 585.00 B: mhm mhm yeah [lipsmack] and uh i guess like we were [lipsmack] talking about before that sometimes the social aspect you know 

584.78 586.62 A: right 

585.27 592.99 B: something people will kind of forget how to communicate with one another and how to relate ideas you know even with uh email like you were saying you know 

592.83 593.84 A: right 

593.13 599.89 B: the good news is you can talk to you know a relative overseas or something like that and not have to pick up the phone and basically communicate
