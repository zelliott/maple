76.35 77.25 A: yeah 

77.59 83.08 A: so ah okay so [laughter] i may as well get going 'cause we only have ten minutes here i guess um 

81.66 82.50 B: okay 

83.34 88.24 A: so family huh what does the word family mean to me um 

88.28 89.33 A: well i guess 

89.46 92.91 A: in in my case ah family's just kind of 

93.66 97.96 A: any i don't know anyone related to you through blood what 

94.92 96.30 B: it could be a b- 

97.12 108.95 B: it could be a black sheep thing but yet it can be a more support thing you know it all depends on how things go in the family you know you could be good to others and others can be jealous and turn their back against you 

108.60 113.06 A: hm absolutely actually that's that's a good point 

109.46 113.98 B: you know so it could be an outgoing thing 

113.32 114.27 A: what 

114.07 120.04 B: it the families you can be an outgoing thing you know in other words you can be damned if you do and damned if you don't 

116.91 117.71 A: yeah 

119.66 120.66 A: yeah 

121.52 124.46 A: absol- yeah no that that's true i mean um 

124.77 130.16 A: i guess like my i come from like my family in ah has come out of boston is ah 

130.30 133.87 A: like eleven members deep my dad had a 

134.71 143.87 A: let's see nine brothers and sisters and then his t- his ah his mom and dad obviously and ah just a huge family that's really just ah been 

142.78 148.17 B: oh my gosh i got a huge family too i got family over in europe 'cause i'm originally from europe 

147.83 149.38 A: oh where in europe 

148.77 150.89 B: frankfurt east germany 

150.43 151.73 A: oh really 

151.21 159.31 B: uh-huh i was born and raised in germany and came to the states with my dad ever since the age of six and i've been here since the age of six and 

158.88 159.92 A: wow 

159.56 171.99 B: it's a black sheep thing because my dad's people ah somehow they don't get along with my stepmother and her people so i'm caught in the middle 'cause when i try to do for my stepmother it makes my dad's people upset and when i 

171.86 177.80 B: do for my f- father and his people it makes my stepmother and her people upset [laughter] 

176.28 178.40 A: oh that's too bad 

177.88 179.40 B: yeah it is but 

178.57 184.87 A: i never understood that like people have to kind of accept that there's more than one side of the family [laughter] 

184.94 191.13 B: yeah it's hard to deal with you know but you've got to learn to accept it and try to make the best out of it you know 

184.94 185.85 A: (( you know )) 

190.98 191.94 A: yeah 

191.37 195.26 B: (( mhm )) 

192.99 201.99 A: it's true i mean [laughter] acceptance i guess is the key 'cause every person in your family although they may be related to you and this is just like immediate family 

201.93 212.00 A: they may be related to you with your blood or or whatever and but they're all brought up in their own specific circumstances and ah everyone grows up a little differently 

209.64 210.77 B: well my step- 

211.54 222.83 B: that's true because my dad's people are well off you know in the society you know money talks and bullshit walks and my stepmother is just and her family's just like being on another gerry springer 

217.37 218.38 A: mhm 

222.96 226.06 A: (( [laughter] )) 

223.79 227.67 B: [laughter] so ah you know you take that for what it's worth 

227.63 230.41 A: yeah [laughter] that's true 

230.19 232.46 B: (( [laughter] )) 

230.71 231.70 A: yeah 

232.26 233.61 A: so um 

233.74 235.76 A: so do you mind if i ask how old you are 

235.74 237.05 B: huh 

236.49 238.66 A: do you mind if i ask how old you are 

238.21 240.53 B: no i'm thirty nine years' old 

240.05 241.20 A: (( thirty nine )) 

240.92 243.19 B: i'm thirty nine and i'm single 

243.35 244.54 A: cool 

244.12 246.61 B: never been married never had no kids 

246.75 252.44 B: and before curiosity yes i'm gay i've been gay all my life [laughter] so you know 

250.22 254.34 A: [laughter] i wasn't even going to ask [laughter] but 

252.93 255.95 B: but i'm picky on who i do my thing with you know 

255.86 256.74 A: yeah 

256.17 262.06 B: and so forth no i don't mind people asking me questions ah you know i've nothing to hide or be ashamed of i'm totally open 

261.47 264.42 A: absolutely that's that's the perfect way to feel 

265.09 266.40 A: that's a good thing 

265.82 269.66 B: 'cause if i was going to be a hush hush type person why would i have a phone you know 

269.65 270.62 A: yeah 

269.79 272.55 B: there there's no sense in being quiet about things 

272.33 273.70 A: yeah 

274.24 281.21 A: absolutely no you know i mean whatever whatever you are that's what you are there's no reason to no need denying it [laughter] 

280.66 282.39 B: that's true 

281.22 283.69 A: and or being ashamed of it in any way 

283.09 284.63 B: oh no uh-uh 

284.40 286.88 A: yeah so that's that's right on 

287.88 290.02 A: um let me think here 

290.38 295.19 A: ah ah i've i got to say this is i mean this is my first call at least is it your first 

294.92 299.96 B: no it's my actually my second ah call that somebody's called me mhm 

297.27 298.51 A: second 

299.65 300.50 A: wow 

300.34 305.08 B: and the first call i got had a lot to do with science fiction stuff on t._v. 

304.93 305.97 A: yeah 

305.72 310.43 B: and that conversation was weird i mean i i was speaking to a woman that 

310.65 318.27 B: knew spanish only and very little english and with me speaking two different other languages besides english and 

312.89 313.70 A: ooh 

318.21 319.13 A: yeah 

318.31 330.28 B: god i was kind of speechless i was saying yeah you know that type of thing [laughter] 'cause i was just i wasn't trying to be rude or impolite you know but i don't know spanish but i do know german and i do know russian 

320.44 324.93 A: [laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

325.96 327.15 A: oh yeah 

330.39 334.30 A: and you know if you don't know the same language it makes it very hard to [laughter] communicate 

333.77 335.40 B: correctly 

334.70 337.28 A: [laughter] so 

336.31 339.77 B: 'cause it's like today i was up at the library checking my email 

339.57 340.47 A: yeah 

339.85 351.92 B: and whoever was on the computer knew spanish they must have been mexican and i got in this one chatroom and it was all in spanish and i was trying to figure out well how can i get this person off their site and you know go to english 

352.06 356.68 B: and the bottom of it is just it took me a good half to an hour to figure out what i was doing [laughter] 

355.97 358.66 A: [laughter] 

357.07 363.89 B: but i'm not against nobody's other language barrier you know because it's just one of those things but it's just odd you know 

360.35 361.40 A: (( oh no )) 

363.63 367.32 A: yeah i mean there's no denying the fact that it's hard 

367.08 381.30 A: it's it's funny and and hard [laughter] to try and deal with someone else who speaks another language i mean not that it's a bad thing that they speak that other language but it's just [laughter] there's no use denying the fact that you don't understand what's being said [laughter] 

372.97 374.39 B: yeah 

379.56 384.61 B: well you know english is the hardest language 'cause it's a flat type thing but ah 

382.84 383.85 A: yeah 

384.89 389.56 B: foreign language is more easy to pick up 'cause it's got like a musical sound to it 

389.38 390.61 A: yeah 

390.82 392.73 A: huh i never thought about it that way 

392.40 393.53 B: yeah 

394.86 400.36 A: huh yeah i mean i've al- i've always heard english is definitely the or at least one of the hardest to learn 

400.53 409.71 A: ah just 'cause i don't know it's got so many different forms that just spread across so many different like just even of the the country itself 

404.03 406.84 B: mhm 

409.84 410.69 A: [noise] oops 

411.04 412.16 A: um 

413.02 415.85 A: (( but yeah i mean al- all right so i don't know )) 

415.92 419.10 A: thinking back to ah to family right now [laughter] 

418.12 420.01 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

419.36 422.08 A: i just feel that we were totally getting off that subject 

421.63 424.70 B: hey i don't care anything goes just to me you know 

426.00 430.67 B: anything to carry on anything goes anything to carry on the conversation you know 'cause 

426.25 427.12 A: what's that 

431.16 433.34 B: it's you know whatever 

432.86 434.48 A: yeah definitely
