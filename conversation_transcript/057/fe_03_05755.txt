0.39 1.67 B: hello 

1.17 3.23 A: ah hello i'm rob 

3.19 4.40 B: i'm jeff 

4.11 5.16 A: (( all right [noise] )) 

5.49 7.75 A: um what's the topic again 

7.62 10.03 B: ah computers i guess 

9.70 11.19 A: and education 

10.61 12.28 B: education 

12.32 15.72 A: um what do you think of them 

15.54 19.46 B: i think they're a tool a pretty good tool 

20.29 21.24 A: um 

20.58 22.23 B: but nothing more 

22.48 25.13 B: as long as they remain that way they'll be all right ah 

22.54 23.71 A: (( you don't they're )) 

25.19 31.53 A: oh you don't think they could be used as you know independent teaching ah teachers or 

32.85 36.49 A: you know [mn] one day no teachers just you know computers 

36.73 39.15 B: i think that would be dangerous myself 

38.86 43.36 A: [laughter] i agree that i um just got off high school this year and ah 

44.00 51.55 A: we used computers an extensive amount and ah i found that the bulk of what they were used for was ah the games more than anything yeah 

51.29 52.66 B: (( yep )) 

51.91 52.91 A: so 

53.84 55.89 A: i i think that they they can ah 

56.16 58.66 A: help or harm depending on 

59.06 61.51 A: how versed the person is with the computer 

61.39 63.34 B: yeah 

62.96 63.93 A: um 

64.29 65.72 B: i don't think ah 

66.08 71.18 B: as far as that's concerned i don't think anything could ever take the place of a human teacher 

71.14 73.47 A: i agree i completely agree [laughter] 

71.38 72.33 B: um 

73.68 81.91 B: [sigh] you know there's there there's life experiences there that a computer couldn't teach ya and and things i mean ah 

82.86 87.79 B: i've been out of school high school [sigh] going on thirty years now and so 

88.00 89.94 B: but i remember you know 

90.33 95.78 B: there were ah things i learnt from a teacher in the classroom that that ah 

96.05 98.45 B: i couldn't have learnt from a computer so 

98.22 103.45 A: yeah um and put on top of that the yeah the socio 

103.55 108.94 A: interactive aspect of um having y- you know a human teacher is 

109.12 121.74 A: is definitely worth having them around [mn] um on the other side of that though i've had teachers in the past which absolutely had no skill in teaching whatsoever 

112.86 114.20 B: yeah 

121.56 123.09 B: yeah i did too 

122.98 123.88 A: so 

123.91 125.07 A: that's um 

127.55 128.57 A: (( ah [noise] )) 

128.72 133.72 A: the computers definitely help the learning experience 

133.12 140.78 B: oh yeah i think they're i think they're something that everybody should learn you know they're part of our life now and probably will remain so 

133.89 135.16 A: (( as well as mhm )) 

141.30 147.02 A: yeah if not become more and more so so if it will eventually more and more so 

141.53 143.19 B: but just as long as 

143.73 144.65 B: huh 

147.17 149.11 B: yeah 

148.23 149.18 A: um 

150.54 154.23 B: yeah i see i see that coming too you know now they've got um 

157.35 162.09 B: computers in cars where you can track them down no matter where they are or what's going on 

161.65 162.95 A: yeah 

162.48 163.66 B: (( but ah )) 

164.31 172.77 B: i see them as a tool and only as a tool you know a teaching tool ah security tool um 

173.70 177.66 B: and i feel as long as they remain a tool and nothing more 

177.86 179.98 B: we'll be all right with them 

179.38 184.10 A: then i don't think that's gonna happen now that's the that's the problem ah 

181.73 183.09 B: yeah 

184.43 189.67 A: they're already delving into you know com- computer robotics artificial intelligence 

189.99 193.64 A: pretty soon they they might go from being a tool to a species 

194.28 196.16 B: that's where it gets dangerous 

195.75 197.55 A: yeah 

198.05 198.95 A: (( ah )) 

199.56 205.25 B: i mean we human beings we so easily give inanimate objects 

205.86 209.13 B: the characteristics of life anyway 

209.36 216.91 B: and when it starts walking and talking and acting like a human being it would be real easy to accept it as that or close 

209.41 210.18 A: mhm 

217.00 218.91 B: and i think that would be dangerous 

218.75 226.88 A: yeah [noise] but ah you know human humans themselves are dang- are you know the most dangerous species [laughter] overall 

225.98 228.10 B: yeah we are 

227.68 228.74 A: um 

229.18 233.59 A: i would think that a robot would have more to fear from us than we would [noise] from it 

234.23 238.06 B: but once the artificial intelligence learns 

238.25 242.48 B: and becomes as arrogant as we are then it would be dangerous 

242.00 243.68 A: yes very dangerous 

244.81 245.76 A: um 

247.70 248.78 A: (( [mn] now )) 

248.86 252.85 A: d- d- well have you used ah comp- ah computers in 

252.86 255.33 A: learning or teaching either one 

255.47 261.45 B: i've in learning you know learn to to learn to use the computer i've ah 

261.89 274.03 B: i have to interact with it at work ordering parts and things like that but i have one here at home that i use all the time i'm into digital photography so 

273.81 274.69 A: (( uh-huh ah )) 

275.08 280.58 B: i load a lot of my photographs on it and burn c._d.s with it to 

281.94 286.11 B: but ah like i said i see it as a tool and as 

286.28 291.94 B: even with artificial intelligence as long as it remains in that category a tool 

292.96 295.18 B: we should be all right 

294.48 295.92 A: yeah that's 

296.14 297.63 A: kinda like um 

299.06 300.12 A: oh 

300.16 301.42 A: i can't think of 

301.43 303.09 A: a good example [noise] but 

303.72 304.72 A: um 

306.44 313.00 A: where as eventually you know the student becomes you know ah the master and 

313.98 317.88 A: like if we had any kind of artificial intell- intelligence 

317.99 320.31 A: it would have the ability to 

320.59 326.90 A: um advance so much faster than we would that it would be dangerous 

324.64 325.44 B: yep 

327.57 328.40 A: (( ah )) 

328.90 336.93 A: but now in schools ah i actually had a class where we could learn robotics and go on to very basic artificial intelligence 

336.72 338.54 B: yeah 

338.57 339.47 A: (( so mm mhm [cough] )) 

339.62 345.66 B: well see even that as a tool for example exploring other planets 

346.31 353.75 B: that would it's just ah as long as i said they they they don't gain our arrogance 

353.74 354.94 A: yeah [laughter] 

355.03 358.37 B: once they gain that they would be dangerous 

360.31 361.16 A: um 

363.05 367.41 A: so you work with computers on a daily basis would you say 

367.40 376.90 B: yeah b- it's not a ah not a i'm not i'm a welder so like i said i i have to get on the computer and log in my part orders 

377.57 379.85 B: on a daily basis to ah 

380.43 385.11 B: keep myself supplied with parts to do what i've gotta do as a welder 

385.23 391.27 B: but other than that as far as work is concerned i don't interact with them that much 

391.08 397.24 A: oh do you find your industry having um more and more to do with computers or 

397.53 400.52 B: it's getting that way yeah 

399.61 403.40 A: do you believe you in the future your job will be threatened because of computers 

403.25 404.36 B: do what now 

403.99 407.64 A: do you believe in the future your job will be threatened just because of computers 

407.64 409.40 B: as a welder no 

409.69 416.14 B: um you know you see these advertisements on television where the robots are welding the cars 

416.41 431.08 B: and um that's okay for a car but the kind of things that i weld together are each one is different from the n- previous one and so it would be it would be really hard for them to program a machine to sit and do the same thing 

431.66 432.76 B: and then 

432.86 436.04 B: the next time around do it a little different 

437.51 438.96 A: (( mm they would have to )) 

437.60 441.35 B: so at least for the time being i don't i don't 

442.21 446.80 A: yeah that's one advantage we have over a computer is reasoning so 

446.89 448.10 B: yep 

447.39 449.39 A: they think what we tell them to think 

450.41 451.31 A: um 

456.85 458.07 A: so you know 

458.33 463.90 A: i work with computers you know on a daily basis i work with dell a lot and ah 

464.39 467.87 A: things have really have become a long way like 

468.12 469.23 A: [noise] like um 

469.28 471.37 A: at dell they actually have a a 

471.75 476.80 A: robotic arm that's hook up to a computer and it's used as a teaching tool 

476.88 478.71 B: yeah 

477.05 480.07 A: not for you know small children [laughter] um 

482.69 487.61 A: but it it's follows very basic commands the kids seem to be 

485.41 486.71 B: yeah 

487.77 489.45 A: (( very interested in them [noise] [noise] )) 

491.27 502.29 B: yeah but i think the biggest machine they've got at work runs the two lasers that cut the stainless steel i've never messed with it i've watched it do it's thing but that machine seems to have 

502.40 506.70 B: a mind of it's ow- ar- artificial intelligence seems to have a mind of it's own but 

507.91 515.99 B: it can actually tell a man that's operating it whether he's got the bad or good side of the stainless steel up and how to how to 

513.83 514.97 A: [laughter] 

516.23 519.57 B: so it's it's got an eye on it that detects 

520.46 527.92 B: the thickness of the surface and whether the surface is right or not before it cuts and then it cuts the patterns out 

528.30 529.62 A: yeah [laughter] 

531.49 532.67 B: (( but ah )) 

533.07 538.02 B: as far as education is concerned i think they're a tool and a darn good one 

538.37 541.49 B: but no i don't think they'll ever take the place of a 

542.27 544.01 B: human school teacher 

544.16 552.47 A: [mn] well it it's neat because this is you know the first time in years you know years well this age where um 

553.22 562.98 A: we have an example of you know the students are teaching the teachers like a lot of my teachers didn't know what an email was when i first got in you know 

563.04 567.16 A: high school and a lot of us had to teach them what it was 

564.17 565.05 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

567.84 568.77 A: so 

567.99 568.58 B: (( [noise] )) 

570.07 571.92 B: yep 

570.12 574.02 A: they've they've definitely added a new twist on learning 

573.59 581.09 B: yeah the massive amount of information you have access to with it you know a world wide web and shit yeah 

581.07 586.36 A: yeah that's a problem to though you know 'cause really you can have any kind of information 

586.73 587.57 A: (( ah )) 

588.36 593.69 A: you know when you find stuff on there you know people can find out how to do anything from 

594.16 596.78 A: you know cook a ham sandwich to 

596.98 599.55 A: make a bomb that's a problem [laughter] 

598.05 599.09 B: (( [noise] yeah ))
