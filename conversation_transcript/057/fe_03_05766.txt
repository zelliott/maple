1.36 2.94 B: (( [mn] hello )) 

2.48 3.88 A: hello 

3.53 5.01 B: hi my name's adam 

5.10 6.15 A: hey i'm andrew 

5.91 10.47 B: hey um so computers and education um 

11.22 19.50 B: i think ah the only thing they're good for is doing research in terms of learning especially at a young age i think they're pretty useless 

19.87 33.43 A: ah i think you're right and i think that there's a lot of educational software out there that is just basically entertainment under the guise of learning fractions and stuff like that [noise] i'd have to say that as a research tool it is absolutely indispensable however 

27.43 29.06 B: right yeah 

33.37 38.62 B: yeah definitely i agree um yeah i think especially with learning to read um 

39.54 46.57 B: and other things like multiplication and everything else it anything that's on the computer is just going to be something that's more entertaining 

46.69 54.36 B: but can't be as effective as just learning it on paper or person to person i mean learning with ah 

54.64 59.47 B: learning with a computer just telling you something can't be as effective as learning having like a teacher do it 

59.28 60.99 A: (( yeah )) 

59.54 69.77 B: and um i i just think it's important for young kids to read more than to be on a computer like if you're going to do anything educational you should be reading a book instead of being on a computer doing anything 

69.11 80.30 A: i definitely agree um but i think it is important that kids ah sort of learn the language of computers and have that available to them i know that people that weren't raised on them have a hard time learning at a later age um 

79.03 80.63 B: right definitely 

80.61 91.18 A: and it can be useful for teaching things like interactivity um there are a couple of noble games actually by the the creators of ah the who did myst but i mean there's children's games 

91.11 97.48 A: and you couldn't die and you couldn't win there were just exploration and interactivity and very very well done 

97.37 99.33 B: yeah i'd agree um 

99.82 102.66 B: yeah kids definitely use a computer i don't 

102.68 113.24 B: um i mean maybe for resea- maybe for i i i don't know what youn- extremely young kids like i'm talking about like five or six year olds i don't know what they could do that was really productive on it but um 

113.53 116.96 B: yeah i definitely think maybe for like an hour a week possibly 

116.90 118.99 A: something like that 

117.09 120.29 B: so- something extremely limited like that 

120.54 131.93 A: um i talked to a woman on the same topic actually earlier today who said she had educational software for her kids um but wouldn't let them use it that much of the time which was a a good thing 

131.99 133.68 A: are you in college or are you 

133.42 144.14 B: yes and um yeah i'm an extremely successful um person i didn't i'm not from an a ah wealthy family i didn't ow- own a computer until ah 

134.69 135.67 A: um 

144.30 151.86 B: i went to college i just had a word processor and um i don't think it impeded me in any way um 

146.95 148.69 A: (( yeah )) 

153.37 158.12 B: ah yeah um i i mean i read a lot of books when i was a kid 

157.92 168.69 B: um i and i even think the type of research that it's helpful for is research that kids don't really do i just think in general they need to use it a little bit when they're a kid like you said so that 

168.85 171.96 B: they're literate as adults in using a computer 

172.98 174.04 B: but um 

173.10 183.93 A: yeah and and when your kid uses the computer all the time that's only going to um you know lead to more what's as a._d._d. and visually short attention spans and want to be entertained all the time 

183.07 186.29 B: right yeah i would agree 

187.38 188.34 A: um 

189.38 195.09 A: as far as it goes though for my education it's just indispensable i i ah 

195.23 204.63 A: use it at my school and i have a really fast internet connection and i get to watch cspan and do all the stuff that i wouldn't normally be able to so i'm all in favor on the high level 

203.56 205.18 B: yeah definitely 

205.30 209.38 A: well i think we're pretty much in agreement i don't know if i can keep going for ten minutes 

208.42 210.11 B: yeah um 

214.06 215.21 B: (( hm um )) 

215.11 216.07 A: [mn] 

216.12 218.17 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

218.29 231.08 A: um i'm interested though in the phenomenon of instant messenger i don't know if you have younger siblings or anything um but my younger brother is fifteen or just turned sixteen and he and all of his friends do almost all their socializing on it um 

230.20 240.83 B: yeah i really think it's like the same ah i mean with me in college like yeah i definitely know a lot of people that do that i think it's just like the only reason i have it is because everyone 

241.05 244.17 B: that's my friend has it and they use it so much 

244.21 249.02 B: but i just think it's really stupid i i see no reason not to call a person directly 

249.16 250.29 B: um 

251.41 254.21 B: and and i just use it so much and um 

254.36 266.18 B: i mean there's no problem with it when you're just trying to say hey i'll be over in two seconds 'cause you don't want to have to call the person but um i mean for extended conversation i just think it's dumb 'cause you can't tell emotion from it 

260.45 262.10 A: (( yeah )) 

265.82 279.52 A: it's very easy to have misread there are a lot of dangers in it and i i sort of worry about what this generation's going to be like because all these kids are using it for everything and they're going to grow up you know without having ah that much in the way of interpersonal skills 

280.00 289.40 A: 'cause they're gonna wanna you know type in their their smiley face and they won't have it i mean not that obvious obviously but it's gonna have definitely su- subtle ramifications 

285.92 286.80 B: yeah 

289.21 291.99 B: yeah i i'd agree with that um 

305.14 305.74 B: (( [noise] )) 

309.01 310.95 A: what's that noise 

310.88 313.71 B: oh my ah roommate's just opening a package

341.65 347.87 B: just sent me an email about it i don't know how he found out about it but ah yeah you know ten dollars should 

348.04 350.58 B: ten dollars for ten minutes it's not a bad thing 

350.57 357.95 A: yeah it's going to be like what eight weeks before we get the check before you get the check for this conversation but i'm hop- i'm hoping by then i won't be broke 

355.28 356.39 B: oh really

358.91 361.34 A: (( but even so it'd be nice to have in cash ))

368.85 371.23 B: yeah i i don't know what they're studying so 

370.80 379.08 A: well i don't think they're actually studying education and computers i think they're studying linguistics and how conversations happen so it might be useful to them after all 

376.23 377.76 B: yeah yeah 

378.07 382.06 B: yeah it's definitely something about oh yeah i don't know what exactly but um [mn] 

383.58 389.97 A: um i read somewhere that the average person gets ah anxious and uncomfortable after four seconds of ssilence in 

390.22 391.47 A: a conversation 

392.17 395.12 A: and feels the need to say something even if it's very inane
