0.20 1.48 A: hello 

0.38 4.56 B: hi this is hi this is sati 

4.11 6.52 A: my name is tim brophy from new jersey 

6.45 9.20 B: (( oh i'm from new york city )) 

8.60 9.81 A: okay 

10.10 12.87 A: ah so what do you think about computers in education 

12.73 20.59 B: [noise] ah i do think it opens up a new things but ah also there are bad sides to it one of them is ah the feedback 

20.56 27.93 B: ah that you get and also having ah other people in the classroom as well as having a teacher entrapped with you 

27.60 28.82 A: mhm [sigh] 

28.21 31.27 B: i think so there's lots of negative aspects of it 

31.60 45.93 A: oh yeah comp- computers can be a good teaching technique but they also can have bad aspects which we have seen computers are good in the school but at home they're a little more dangerous because of the chat rooms and all the message boards that they have on the computer 

45.78 57.32 A: they're a good educational tool and they're good for homework but don't make kids totally rely on computers without doing some good old fashion you know looking up in the books for the information they need 

49.06 49.79 B: [noise] 

54.92 55.52 B: [noise] 

57.16 63.18 B: yeah i mean most of them are better books and most of them are interesting books i've given up on the online 

63.08 64.27 A: oh yeah 

63.97 65.87 B: and get a lot of those things 

66.20 80.41 B: but i don't think become faster i mean if you want to look up something in the encyclopedia now you can look up in the web or you can even have the encyclopedia with sound and music and and ah video and all that so it adds a lot of things [noise] [noise] 

79.40 86.79 A: [noise] oh it it definitely does add a lot things ah and ah and it's a good tool and ah 

81.87 85.90 B: (( yeah )) 

86.88 99.18 A: as far as ah for schools i i think it's a good idea for them to invest in them and also you you might you're gonna have to learn to computers because if you don't you're gonna get left behind that's the 

98.26 100.38 B: (( definitely )) 

99.36 108.20 A: and you know because that's where technology's taking us 'cause you we already see it now where you you basically can do everything online your banking everything 

107.99 115.01 A: and that's also dangerous but as far as education and the future you're gonna have to be able to be familiar with computers 

113.49 126.98 B: mhm yes that's an interesting thing i notice like in the libraries i see ah and for the neighborhoods when i go there the kids are ah looking at information using it almost like i said 

126.85 140.08 B: for useful things so as an a research tool for their homework and so on but i have also been in some neighborhoods where the kids get on and they know these websites to go to to play games [noise] [noise] and so they 

138.31 149.51 A: mhm [laughter] yeah yeah that's the down side too there's a there's a def- definitely down side to that they go play video games instead of doing what they're su- you know but but if ah 

140.23 141.06 B: [noise] 

149.65 162.06 A: there are some good places like my daughter she's only five and she ah goes to some places where like she goes to door explorer which i think is very good because it teaches her bilingual skills 

153.06 155.30 B: mhm 

161.86 172.44 A: which i think is excellent you know and i'm hoping that she will learn bilingual because the m- m- more that you're bilingual that that the better job opportunities you have 

161.89 163.17 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

163.53 164.41 B: [noise] 

170.61 178.47 B: mhm this is interesting because in the neighborhood i have just moved to is also mainly hispanic 

178.01 179.17 A: (( oh okay [noise] )) 

178.95 192.20 B: american so i i do think that's a good thing because otherwise in the neighborhood they get exposed to primarily to ah spanish and i think the teachers are are spanish too since i have volunteered in some of the schools in the neighborhood in the past 

192.02 200.34 B: so it is i mean then they get on the net in that they have to learn english because i mean that's the primary media i mean language there so 

197.23 198.34 A: oh yes 

199.87 200.74 A: (( [noise] yep )) 

200.77 204.19 B: that's a good thing actually how they get exposed to other things 

202.40 209.57 A: yep our parents stop vacuuming i can't hear [laughter] that's my little five year old now with a little vacuum 

205.70 210.29 B: [laughter] [noise] [noise] 

209.95 212.39 A: but yeah i i figure that the comp- 

212.59 222.83 A: ninety percent of the comp- the time the computer can be a good tool [noise] and though you know ten per cent at home you're just gotta be careful you know you gotta put programs in 

215.74 217.83 B: (( mhm [noise] yeah )) 

221.31 222.35 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

222.62 226.70 A: that won't let you're ah little ones go on chat rooms where 

222.99 231.50 B: (( right )) 

226.57 241.25 A: you know you can have predators and stuff and that's the only thing that's the downside of them but you know most of the time the computers are u- very useful tool you know i'm thirty seven and you know i just started getting into computers you know about three years ago and i find them very useful you know 

238.72 240.64 B: [noise] 

240.89 242.09 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

241.25 255.24 A: you know 'cause i like you know i used i love history and stuff and i love looking up stuff like in the past and they're they're definitely a good tool like you said you can basically look up the encyclopedia on the com- everything on the computer you know [lipsmack] but ah 

249.50 255.04 B: mhm yeah [noise] [noise] 

255.06 269.39 A: you don't like i said you don't wanna totally rely on the computer 'cause i enjoy reading a good book [noise] some- you know you don't want to get like where they're just reading on a computer you know books have a purpose [noise] too they're you know they're our past 

269.52 281.31 B: [noise] and also i mean it may take up time like i mean in the past before they had computers the kids played with each other now they have computer games so the days they when they [noise] 

274.69 276.02 A: mhm 

276.49 277.46 A: yeah 

279.91 284.12 A: [noise] yeah that that that's another good point you bring up you say computers ah 

284.17 294.49 A: ah they get on the computer too much where they they they don't realize that they're on it for such a long period of time and they're not actually going outside and being a kid anymore 

285.07 289.62 B: mhm 

291.03 292.91 B: (( [noise] )) 

293.85 296.18 B: (( exactly i mean [noise] )) 

294.82 304.50 A: you know and that's you know that that was another good point that's another downside of the computer where kids are not ah going outside and playing like they used to 

304.24 312.73 B: mhm i don't know i mean on the other hand the computers are supposed to help the kids ah learn certain other skills also like um 

312.92 320.47 B: [noise] ah probably they may do better over the next few years the children are supposed to get better i._q. tests and so on because 

320.69 325.81 B: um in you know in the past the parents have to teach them about 

326.01 327.84 B: things and so the kids 

326.63 329.32 A: oh oh oh yeah yeah 

328.15 331.13 B: (( to learn now everything is on the computer so )) 

330.66 344.67 A: it's a self teaching tool it's very good it also teaches them typing 'cause i i i was terrible when i got on the computer i was the one figure typer you know use the o- use the one finger now i can type pretty good but ah but i couldn't type before [laughter] [noise] 

332.36 334.17 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

334.72 336.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

336.39 337.85 B: (( [noise] )) 

341.48 343.40 B: (( [laughter] yes [noise] )) 

343.81 348.83 B: mhm mhm and ah yeah i mean so um 

349.02 354.53 B: also again the the teachers also sometimes may use the computers as a kind of like a fill in 

354.61 362.44 B: and when they are not too interested in teaching they could say oh just look up something on the computer or something this is also a bad thing i think 

361.78 371.17 A: yeah um like our when my daughter was in school i think they were on a computer like once a week and they would you know teach them some basics and everything 

371.01 380.21 A: and you know that was you know a good thing and like you said as long as the teacher isn't using it as a tool to keep the kid occupied instead of teaching 

379.86 381.09 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

380.47 393.09 A: you know that's where you gotta be careful and that and that's another third good point you know does the computer become the teacher or you know it depends on the teacher if a good teacher is a good teacher she's not gonna rely on the computer 

391.37 392.31 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

392.99 401.60 B: yeah and ah do they have filters installed on the machine so that the children can't get ah ah adult sites and so on [noise] 

400.86 402.87 A: oh yeah definitely definitely 

402.13 403.44 B: okay 

403.34 404.58 A: yeah definitely 

404.39 418.57 A: you know and ah i'm pretty sure their safe guards are i don't i you know their safe guards are pretty more intense than what you have at home unless you're really into computers and you buy the ah you know the packages to protect your computer 

407.85 408.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

414.72 415.55 B: (( [noise] )) 

418.37 421.02 B: mhm mhm 

419.20 420.59 A: you know because ah 

420.61 424.10 A: i you know at home i have quite a bit of computer i have two 

422.97 424.25 B: (( [noise] )) 

424.21 438.05 A: home based computers and two laptops and ah one computer's for my daughter and that's the only computer she can use because that one has the safe guards the other three are adult computers you know which she's not allowed on 

427.12 428.19 B: okay 

431.67 436.49 B: (( mhm )) 

438.07 440.89 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

438.66 442.99 A: (( yep so she has all hers and and )) 

441.10 442.55 B: (( all of her things programmed with )) 

442.95 443.85 B: (( the things )) 

444.65 445.67 A: (( you )) 

445.64 452.89 B: ((  )) 

446.43 447.27 A: (( know )) 

448.27 455.32 A: they they they have a lot of good programs you know like like i said ah blues clues and all that teach- teaches 

453.84 459.44 B: [noise] blues clues yes [laughter] [noise] i have a niece who is about the same age so i know 

458.59 469.24 A: oh okay [laughter] yeah yeah i'm i i haven't seen adult shows in a long time i'm i'm i'm i'm mostly watching the cartoon channel or pbs [laughter] 

466.28 472.97 B: [laughter] yes i could imagine because i i whenever i visit my 

472.43 473.45 A: (( [laughter] )) 

473.02 476.02 B: brother i see the same thing 

475.55 485.02 A: yeah but it's neat to see them on a computer like it's amazing my daughter knows you know when we first started out you know she she really took to it you know like a 

485.15 497.25 A: a sometimes computers get me frustrated 'cause they don't run like they're supposed to but ah anyway with as far as educational like y- like you said that those there's three good points they're you know 

495.50 496.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

497.37 506.85 A: you gotta watch that the teacher don't use them as a a a as a tea- ah to become a teacher and another thing is is a kid 

503.03 504.44 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

506.83 513.43 A: gets too much time on the computer instead of you know good old reading books and the other thing is you know 

513.36 524.92 A: the the predators out there [noise] but as far as the school having computers i think it's a good idea because that's gonna be the generation that's wh- that's what's gonna be in the future you know basically everything computer 

515.93 517.90 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

522.39 529.58 B: mhm mhm and like you said it's interesting that the kids actually ah 

529.77 535.26 B: like you know we tend to kind of figure try to figure out things a bit slowly on the computers 

533.35 534.08 A: oh 

535.30 546.93 B: but the kids kind of have this ah like they you could put them in front of the computer and after five or ten minutes they would make all kinds of mistakes but they would try different things and they would figure out how to use the stuff 

545.90 551.58 A: [sigh] other their curiosity their curiosity is and and they can soak up like a sponge you know 

547.70 550.84 B: [laughter] 

551.44 553.65 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

552.27 553.38 A: (( and ah )) 

553.29 564.42 A: and that's what's good about being young you know like i said it was harder for me to pick up the computers than her because kids are like sponges you know and i i like you know education wise is excellent 

557.12 559.50 B: yeah 

560.23 561.15 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

564.32 575.96 A: like when i get on a computer and it starts printing error and error out you know i i don't know what the problem is the motherboard be arguing with the printer and everything but but anyway ah 

566.52 567.54 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

572.67 574.98 B: mhm 

575.87 581.84 A: you know i'm all for it but as long as it doesn't you know become the teacher instead of the teacher doing the teaching 

581.53 583.99 B: (( yeah and )) 

582.77 593.10 A: and also another bad thing is at home because you you you want them you want to use them for educational but you don't want them to use it as their play time instead of going outside and getting some good old 

592.05 595.28 B: exactly uh-huh mhm 

593.77 596.43 A: some good old play time outside 

595.89 599.89 B: yeah and also the playtime with the like their friends and making friends 

599.36 599.89 A: (( oh yeah ))
