32.03 45.42 B: well you know i i i really don't think there's many countries that are you know really you know could be possible problems i mean i think one of the main ones are china you know they're supposed to be somewhat of our ally now but 

44.81 48.70 A: yeah but you you can never tell because because uh they're kinda laying low for now 

48.30 49.73 B: exactly

52.00 56.68 B: yep i'm not really worried about south i mean north korea much i mean that's not really a big 

52.56 54.28 A: yeah 

56.84 58.41 B: big worry to me i 

56.88 62.40 A: yeah that's the one they they kind of over emphasized on on the news or in the past so 

62.11 63.38 B: exactly 

62.52 69.64 A: it gives like other countries who who are more of a threat you know they can go on other radar and 

68.94 80.02 B: exactly you know i you know like i say you know the main one that you know i would only really seriously be worried about is is really china and you really just you never know 

69.74 71.60 A: yeah 

77.23 77.97 A: mm 

79.72 92.36 A: 'cause they have such a they they have such a huge army like yeah and um i i i don't i have no idea what they have but i mean m- maybe others do but uh i haven't read up on what what kind of weaponry they have or 

82.19 84.09 B: yep they they do 

92.04 93.19 B: well they've 

92.39 94.65 A: what they've stockpiled 

93.40 103.80 B: they've pretty much got it all i mean nuclear weapons i mean you really uh you name it and they've got the the the amount of people and like well like you're saying 

94.95 97.00 A: [laughter] 

101.79 105.16 A: yeah the the just sheer manpower yeah 

103.90 109.95 B: yeah you know i mean it's hard to i mean you could like i say you know if you went to war with 'em you know 

107.29 109.01 A: yeah 

110.17 114.39 B: you know it would be hard to you know by such mass numbers you know 

113.51 122.53 A: mhm i i once heard that uh if everyone in china were to sit down at the same time it would cause uh an earthquake that would cause tidal waves on on the united states side 

114.42 115.36 B: that would be 

122.16 123.20 B: wow 

122.72 129.54 A: yeah if everybody sat at the same time there's so many people there [laughter] there are yeah they just do that if [laughter] they're organized well enough 

124.20 125.70 B: [laughter] 

126.69 127.61 B: yep 

129.06 132.39 B: (( yeah really that's all we need i mean )) 

129.98 140.44 A: yeah yeah but i mean now everybody's afraid of every country in making uh allies with any country because of the news how it glorifies everything 

134.47 135.62 B: well 

139.11 151.27 B: yep i mean that's see that's the bad thing about it i mean you know nowadays is you know i you know i'm not saying that we didn't have these problems you know ten fifteen years ago but you know i sure didn't know about 'em as much then 

150.85 152.60 A: yeah 

151.42 155.87 B: you know which could be you know there could be many reasons for that i mean just 

154.79 167.93 A: yeah it's just news like different news stations try to grab people's attention yeah like uh it it may it may be getting like better but it's just that the news makes it sound like it's worse and yeah but 

159.15 160.40 B: yep 

165.81 172.43 B: well yeah you know i don't think our our hope is as grim as it makes it as they make it out to believe 

171.63 182.83 A: yeah i know it's just ev- everything is uh uh sorry everything is a possible end to everything yeah it makes people afraid of of going out in the street which really sucks 

177.56 178.86 B: well yeah 

182.96 187.23 B: yep i know i uh we live in a small town in michigan and it really 

187.56 189.43 B: you know it's really kinda nice 

189.21 190.89 A: yeah 

189.47 193.09 B: i mean but there's really not much around us or anything like that 

192.49 194.28 A: yeah 

193.21 197.27 B: you know and you know like you yourself you know i mean you're not

199.82 204.78 A: no no i do yeah yeah i i do live in the city yeah 

201.03 202.59 B: that would be tough 

203.76 209.27 B: i mean you can remember imagine you know you can remember you know the nine eleven attack 

208.53 211.65 A: oh yeah i ac- i actually saw it happen so 

209.48 210.13 B: (( oh )) 

211.94 216.93 A: yeah like uh yeah when it happened so it was it was kinda crazy yeah 

215.74 223.44 B: yeah that and i mean that would be terrible i mean i mean i think the whole rest of the country you know pretty much what we seen on t. v. that was about it but 

217.66 219.37 A: yeah 

222.74 226.62 A: yeah [laughter] but it didn't really hit home until everybody went home and saw it on t. v. 

226.25 227.09 B: yep 

226.38 238.80 A: 'til they really realized what like from the different angles and different perspectives and that's when it really really hit i mean down here uh the city everybody was on uh on edge not not not as much so now but 

238.63 247.58 A: during the war and that kinda time everybody was on edge of what could possibly happen people were staying away from public areas and yeah 

240.85 241.89 B: yep well ye- 

245.11 254.85 B: [mn] yep well you just don't know i mean you really don't i mean nowadays i mean who would have thought that you know y- you know who would have figured you know 

247.69 249.39 A: yeah

257.77 259.53 A: done this yeah 

257.81 260.52 B: reached out as as far as they did 

259.77 261.87 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

260.70 263.77 B: you know and that's what's more scary than anything is 

262.51 265.81 A: yeah yeah and and and and another scary thing is 

265.94 273.06 A: uh you don't know if like you know that another impending attack is gonna happen but you don't know where or when 

270.82 271.79 B: (( yeah )) 

272.50 273.98 B: exactly 

273.07 278.78 A: it could be twenty years down the road it could be you know two weeks that's also the scary part 

277.51 281.91 B: yep yeah 'cause but unfortunately like you were saying you know it's gonna happen 

281.31 288.31 A: yeah and you can't do anything about it just you have to you can't sit at home the whole your the rest of your life you have to go out there and

297.84 298.93 B: yep 

298.03 305.97 A: like you know that we're on alert and you know they they might you know pick on that or use that as a a weakness for us 

304.57 309.00 B: well yeah that's the you know that could be the downside that's for sure i mean 

308.45 310.14 A: yeah 

309.01 312.91 B: to know that we'll you know strike at just about anything 

313.18 319.15 B: you know i mean i mean look at we've been to war you know what twice in the last two years already

326.39 327.72 B: [laughter] 

328.60 336.81 B: yeah i you know i like i say i just you know you get to the point where you know you don't ever wanna become immune to it because when you do 

336.97 339.26 B: you know there's there's you know 

339.37 341.91 B: people dying for us every day 

340.08 343.15 A: mhm yeah that's that's definitely why 

343.15 354.92 A: p- p- uh people here are anti war and and uh pro war and they you know demand everybody to take sides especially in the city they demand people to take sides and they'll protest all the time but like uh a lot of us just see that as 

349.85 350.75 B: (( yeah )) 

354.72 361.98 A: well not pro war but you can't be anti war because you know our guys are down there our men and women are you know out there fighting you know

367.65 369.95 A: we want our guys to come back 

369.39 372.00 B: i mean you figure people are dying for us every day 

371.82 379.34 A: yeah for every single thing that we you know every freedom that we take for granted or yeah oh 

372.11 374.20 B: i mean every single day over there 

376.69 380.74 B: yep i mean people i don't think really realize 

380.99 387.38 B: you know until after september eleventh you know of all the how lucky we really were and i still don't think people do 

383.50 385.20 A: yeah 

387.32 400.78 A: no they definitely don't if they have they've probably forgotten i mean we go through this we we've already gone through this once or twice like in the past decade but but uh i mean other nations like like uh israel they go through this every day 

389.99 391.34 B: yep 

400.23 401.77 B: i know it's just 

400.84 402.20 A: uh people die 

402.39 411.25 A: uh every day and and uh they still go out and ride the buses and go to school or or walk the streets and you know just uh and we've already forgotten 

406.23 407.31 B: yep 

411.40 414.09 A: you know that kinda pain but they have to live with it every day 

413.69 421.70 B: yeah yeah exactly i mean they are like you're saying they every single day there's somebody you know they gotta worry about if they're gonna make it home or 

421.24 424.66 A: (( yeah i don't know how it's possible to live like that [laughter] )) 

422.00 422.85 B: you know 

424.60 427.71 B: yeah it would be it would be pretty difficult 

427.06 436.30 A: that is definitely like i mean i mean every every like kiss every hug would mean more like in the morning before you go to work or go to school it it would mean a lot more 

431.22 432.45 B: yep yeah 

434.94 441.15 B: yep i mean you would take a lot more things you you wouldn't take as many things you know for granted that's for sure 

439.92 445.42 A: definitely definitely yeah yeah 

441.41 442.47 B: i mean 

442.54 450.05 B: but you know [sigh] unfortunately like i say the the you know the world we we live in 

447.17 448.84 A: yeah 

450.20 451.45 B: is 

451.82 454.21 B: you know not always so nice 

452.43 465.55 A: yeah yeah there can't be we can't be just a peaceful nation i mean 'cause other nations aren't going to follow i mean they're just gonna stomp on us if we [laughter] if we try to be a peaceful nation and all the nations are 

463.88 464.84 B: mhm 

465.63 469.97 A: going to pretend to be a peaceful nation maybe they'll pretend but they won't actually be one 

469.91 471.00 B: yep 

470.32 479.13 A: 'cause it's not uh it's not possible because look at what other people did i mean they'll just take advantage of the opportunity and attack 

472.46 473.32 B: no 

477.68 478.84 B: yep 

479.35 480.85 B: yeah that's for sure 

480.31 483.75 A: (( so yeah so there's probably tons of nations that that uh )) 

484.01 490.33 A: are you know just watching us you know under the microscope for now and just waiting just like you know al al qaeda did or whatever 

485.81 486.37 B: (( [mn] )) 

487.71 488.96 B: yeah trying to 

490.15 492.32 B: trying to figure out what we're gonna do 

491.91 494.93 A: yeah and what they can do you know 

492.81 493.70 B: you know 

494.62 497.65 B: yep how far they can get away with things and 

495.19 504.65 A: which is yeah i mean we on a lot of a lot of other countries are actually against us but we won't find out until probably when it's too late 

503.52 505.68 B: uh yep that's the [laughter] that's 

505.68 510.23 A: (( that's the scary part that's the really scary part yeah yeah )) 

506.59 507.82 B: (( yeah yeah it is )) 

508.24 510.78 B: i mean but 

511.71 514.89 B: you know [sigh] like i you know what what do you do 

515.08 524.96 A: yeah you can't you can't just sit you can't just sit sit back and just you know try to ignore everything or just sit there and pretend it's not happening you just have to like you said before live your life 

524.72 526.55 B: yep that's for sure 

526.45 529.00 A: yeah that's the only that's the only way you you can 

529.43 533.32 A: 'cause i'm i'm not really familiar with recent recent uh 

533.33 545.69 A: current events about what what nations we are allied with or what nations are a threat but uh but i definitely know you know from the past like you said like north korea and the other nations were named as [laughter] as our enemies 

535.42 536.27 B: well 

537.37 538.53 B: yeah i mean 

544.67 545.43 B: (( well )) 

545.53 555.32 B: yeah because like you're saying also i mean everybody's really hanging low you know they really don't know what to think i mean 'cause like i say i mean we will pretty much go and bomb anybody right now 

551.90 554.70 A: (( yeah )) 

554.82 556.59 A: yeah 

555.47 557.41 B: i mean if they even look 

557.39 564.22 A: yeah and and and and any little movement and uh bush will send some people over there to to bomb it or attack 

562.49 563.33 B: yeah 

563.93 565.15 B: yeah exactly 

564.29 567.00 A: or denounce them as as uh allies or 

567.31 569.16 A: what not 

567.66 571.23 B: mhm i mean it was kinda funny to see how the the french 

570.98 572.66 A: yeah [laughter] i was about to say 

572.19 579.50 B: you know and you know as soon as you know the war was over they're like oh it's okay but we wanna make sure we can get in there and make our money 

573.06 574.80 A: yeah 

575.86 577.57 A: yeah 

579.20 582.82 A: yeah i mean we we we went so far as to uh 

579.66 581.39 B: (( you know and that )) 

583.19 592.08 A: uh not call french fries french fries anymore and call them freedom fries [laughter] just just just because they they wouldn't ally with us 

585.74 587.34 B: [laughter] i know 

587.46 588.40 B: i know 

590.88 596.02 B: well they wouldn't back us i mean it was our guys over there dying but when it come down 

592.45 594.34 A: (( yeah )) 

594.48 599.89 A: yeah i mean we backed them out we backed them up and they backed us up in the past and you know way in the past in his- 

598.52 599.48 B: yep
