8.89 10.82 B: about three hours from there [laughter] 

9.30 10.13 A: (( [noise] )) 

10.90 12.06 A: (( um )) 

11.38 13.42 B: (( between armagh and binghamton )) 

13.31 14.28 A: pardon 

13.71 16.59 B: i'm between armagh and binghamton but in pennsylvania 

16.19 19.82 A: oh okay yeah yeah we get up to uh horseheads 

18.79 21.68 B: [noise] okay all right i'm about an hour from there 

21.08 23.65 A: yeah my daughter uh plays volleyball there 

23.09 24.46 B: okay okay 

23.86 25.33 A: so um 

25.55 27.37 A: [lipsmack] the topic is 

26.69 28.86 B: computers in education 

28.58 32.73 A: yeah [noise] i g- i i got to believe that uh 

34.48 39.59 A: they're uh well they're a necessity now [laughter] and uh 

37.83 39.36 B: yeah 

39.62 41.46 A: [noise] and they definitely help 

41.20 42.20 B: (( [noise] right )) 

41.79 52.69 A: [noise] uh immensely i mean i i can't see uh i'd have to think about any negatives against it other than maybe it makes it a little too easy for the kids 

52.71 58.05 B: well the only thing i just don't think i mean i think it should augment but not replace other things 

58.42 60.15 B: do you know what i'm saying and i was 

58.73 60.21 A: um like what 

60.44 64.45 B: i i think that people still have the responsibility to learn how to think on their own 

64.17 65.49 A: yeah 

64.90 68.76 B: [lipsmack] and that the computer's a great aid and assistance you know what i'm saying 

67.94 69.25 A: mhm 

68.99 70.97 B: but um 

71.20 74.59 B: i think that um sometimes 

74.63 78.47 B: people forget [sigh] just how to think [laughter] 

78.39 83.09 A: oh yeah well that yeah i i i agree with that i mean other than uh 

81.44 82.33 B: you know 

83.15 84.50 A: um 

84.06 84.62 B: (( [sigh] )) 

85.34 89.22 A: i mean the kids going for research in and uh 

87.60 89.93 B: oh yeah it's an amazing tool 

89.32 97.51 A: and uh oh i'm saying copying all this research that they tha- that's at their hands in their home computers 

94.04 94.80 B: (( mm )) 

97.50 105.35 A: rather than uh writing a paper on their own is probably not good i mean that's a negative that i can think of off the you know off the top 

100.77 101.59 B: (( right oh sure )) 

102.94 103.92 B: right 

104.18 111.14 B: [noise] but like having the search engines is like having all the world's libraries at your hand at your disposal if you know which 

105.48 106.15 A: (( of )) 

111.30 116.87 B: actually i know when i was growing up just to have one library you were grateful for [laughter] 

113.79 119.60 A: right yeah but i mean as as far as for um 

120.13 130.78 A: papers where they're supposed to do research uh i mean you can't beat the tool of a computer that they can go and uh you know basically they can get into the smithsonian if they want i guess 

125.52 126.76 B: right 

130.22 131.71 B: (( true [noise] )) 

130.88 132.55 A: you know but uh 

133.06 134.95 A: (( [lipsmack] using uh )) 

135.83 145.85 A: you know i mean if they're using a computer to fool round with which is which my daughter does too much and doesn't do enough [mn] enough schoolwork i like her to do a few uh practise s._a._t.s 

143.08 143.97 B: right 

145.61 146.73 B: right 

146.11 148.82 A: um [lipsmack] but uh 

149.06 151.21 A: you know can you think of any other negatives 

151.13 152.64 B: um 

154.16 155.30 B: (( [lipsmack] just when you're )) 

160.06 164.89 B: [mn] not really just the um that i think that there just should be a balance 

165.21 169.02 B: between it and other types of learning you know 

169.13 173.48 A: yeah i know my um my daughter's friend a- at college she uh 

173.96 177.73 A: she got caught plagiarizing [laughter] i mean she verbatim 

178.01 190.22 A: uh passed something off res- research that she did and just changed a few words and uh her professor uh was pretty sharp and picked up on it and the kid got a kid got an f. i mean it was 

181.23 182.54 B: mhm 

187.07 189.05 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

189.31 199.34 B: yeah well because what happens it it degrades you know the person who did the original research right it degrades in a way what they did as well 

194.64 195.84 A: right 

198.54 201.19 A: (( yeah but um )) 

199.69 201.75 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

201.61 206.82 A: i know uh the city schools here in the buffalo area don't have um 

208.29 213.03 A: don't have the uh computers like the uh suburban schools i don't know how it is in your area 

212.38 214.45 B: (( [mn] mhm [noise] )) 

213.17 216.23 A: so th- they don't have the resources but uh 

216.27 217.91 A: you know the kids uh 

218.23 223.40 A: grades as they post them and they rank 'em uh the buffalo schools i mean uh 

220.65 221.59 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

223.52 230.24 A: doesn't help 'em 'cause uh they're pretty well d- you know they're pretty low and it seems like the areas that are uh 

224.50 225.46 B: mhm 

230.25 233.26 A: you know pretty up and have the computers the 

233.31 235.53 A: s._a._t. scores and uh 

235.61 238.52 A: i don't know they take regents exams in uh 

239.33 241.44 B: not in pennsylvania to my knowledge no 

241.06 242.84 A: (( yeah )) 

241.46 246.85 B: yeah i i'm not from here originally i moved here from connecticut um seven years ago 

244.95 246.04 A: okay 

247.24 248.95 B: and um 

249.31 252.51 B: it's you know it's just a much different place than from what where i lived 

252.77 259.94 B: before um well a lot of houses here don't have books [laughter] so it's just a whole different world you know 

256.72 258.24 A: yeah 

259.78 261.31 A: (( but um )) 

261.86 266.12 A: [lipsmack] i mean for um for the research just alone that the kids uh 

266.13 272.59 A: have easy access is just that hopefully they put the uh more time they should have 

272.66 274.52 A: for them to do as much research 

274.30 276.03 B: mhm 

274.81 276.72 A: that they put it to good use 

276.93 279.20 A: but uh like i said the uh 

279.68 285.14 A: the negatives are the lack of uh using their own free mind and uh 

285.29 289.22 A: uh putting together their own thoughts that's the way i look at it 'cause 

288.58 294.40 B: [cough] yeah th- that's what i was sort of implying earlier about you know it shouldn't replace thinking 

294.02 301.19 A: yeah like the clip notes from uh you know i don't know if they got that but um 

296.16 297.08 B: yeah 

297.11 298.29 B: exactly 

301.24 303.13 A: how many of these calls have you taken 

303.19 307.65 B: [sigh] this is my second one i had a call yesterday about foreign affairs 

304.55 305.37 A: (( uh-huh )) 

307.63 311.12 A: oh okay yeah they were on my tape but i didn't 

308.36 309.30 B: (( how about you )) 

311.23 312.13 B: okay 

311.74 316.28 A: (( i i i didn't uh i didn't go it there but um )) 

314.56 315.38 B: uh-huh 

317.18 318.72 A: [lipsmack] i uh 

320.30 325.49 A: going back to the topic i wh- wh- what do they usually do you think they give it to uh somebody 

325.33 326.83 B: [lipsmack] what's that 

326.63 327.76 A: the uh 

329.82 332.88 A: you know th- the connection do they give it to uh 

333.39 335.61 A: you know our tape do they give it to somebody 

335.64 341.41 B: [sigh] well apparently the the purpose of it is i guess for um 

341.51 343.53 B: computer generated speech 

343.39 344.45 A: oh okay 

344.03 351.44 B: where right now i guess if you if you'd done a comp- if you do hear a computer talking it always sounds like a computer rather than a person 

349.48 350.37 A: uh-huh 

352.01 355.58 B: and i guess they're trying to develop a more natural way 

355.92 359.95 B: and i guess a computer can only do that by imitating human speech 

359.77 360.77 A: (( oh okay )) 

360.87 363.57 B: but they have to have enough of it i guess like a 

363.87 364.88 B: to 

365.33 369.97 B: [sigh] for it to uh respond to and have different kinds of people talking 

367.36 369.20 A: (( mhm )) 

369.54 371.07 A: well that would uh 

371.25 372.79 A: you know help uh 

373.90 379.04 A: sal- uh solidify the uh computers being helpful for education you 

378.29 385.38 B: yeah yeah so that's i guess what what what they're trying to do i guess it's university of pennsylvania is doing the study 

379.26 380.06 A: (( know )) 

384.78 385.90 A: oh really 

385.55 388.34 B: yeah and [sigh] 

386.14 388.98 A: oh okay in uh philadelphia area 

388.61 392.37 B: yeah i heard about it a friend of mine lives in new york city and calling me [sigh] 

392.46 395.02 B: and i h- i had no idea about it [mn] 

395.22 402.88 B: so [mn] and y- you call and if you g- if it's a topic you're not interested in then you just wait 'til another day comes up you know 

396.64 397.89 A: (( yeah you )) 

402.62 404.35 A: yeah i uh 

405.11 408.20 A: i was told they they only call you like once 

408.85 411.49 B: no it's i think you're three calls 

412.03 412.91 A: (( oh th- )) 

412.25 414.72 B: they g- they gave you a pin number right 

414.75 416.54 A: um [noise] 

415.33 416.78 B: did they give you a pin number 

417.23 420.07 A: jeeze that they might have i don't know what 

419.08 421.12 B: okay yeah 

420.43 425.13 A: yeah they probably did and i don't know what i did with it do you need that [laughter] 

423.47 427.66 B: [laughter] well i did to connect to you [laughter] 

427.28 431.56 A: oh okay no i just called and they said to hang on and all that stuff 

431.13 432.95 B: uh-huh okay 

431.83 433.14 A: so uh 

433.51 436.97 A: [lipsmack] but uh you know in finishing i i mean uh 

437.03 442.39 A: they just updated the um grammar schools here with brand new computers and uh 

441.04 441.98 B: (( okay )) 

442.50 447.19 A: they uh you know they do it all the uh childproof uh 

446.32 447.79 B: mhm 

447.20 459.48 A: uh blackouts for the uh you know parental control and all that they did all that and uh i mean the kids they carry their own disks right from kindergarten or uh first grade and they 

450.71 451.94 B: sure sure 

456.36 457.18 B: (( oh )) 

459.43 465.58 A: i think my daughter well she's in a middle school and she has she has disks from you know it'll be uh 

465.77 468.84 A: kept for uh you know keepsakes 

468.45 470.86 B: it's amazing isn't it whole different world 

469.30 474.19 A: you know you know and you know you think i mean i'm fifty five i mean 

474.24 483.49 A: you know you know [mn] i don't have any books back or anything and these kids can keep files of disks of uh history of their their uh educational uh 

479.24 482.63 B: (( oh w- i- i- it's a different planet [laughter] )) 

483.48 494.28 A: you know they could just track uh you know and so prob- and they do it in middle school too she's got her own uh software and then uh you know and i'm sure they do something like that at the senior level 

487.47 488.68 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

490.40 491.05 B: (( uh-huh )) 

493.11 499.93 B: yeah w- we were talking about you were talking about negatives earlier i think the only other negative is is that if 

496.42 497.61 A: yeah 

500.14 511.83 B: for this all to work all schools are going to have to have you know good stuff at the same time so that [sigh] you don't have a separate kind of like class distinction you know what i'm saying 

511.58 513.78 A: (( yeah )) 

512.01 516.07 B: people who have computers are a better and people who have ones that are outmoded [sigh] 

515.60 516.51 A: uh-huh 

516.31 525.72 B: you're right they're trying to equalize education right so that means having all students having access to the same kind of uh [laughter] resources [sigh] 

518.65 519.69 A: (( right )) 

523.82 524.91 A: resources 

525.02 526.27 A: yeah yeah 

525.86 528.42 B: uh at the same time you know 

528.71 530.09 B: so there's not a 

528.93 535.47 A: see that's what i was saying up in rochford the buffalo schools just don't have the finances that uh 

534.36 538.07 B: mhm right 

535.56 538.45 A: you know everybody else does so they 

538.52 544.28 A: you know the and it shows in the uh when they post the grades and everything else which stinks 

543.68 544.93 B: (( [sigh] [lipsmack] mm )) 

544.56 546.18 A: you know but uh 

546.65 554.10 A: [lipsmack] they like either the teachers in the buffalo school district have to uh live in the city 

550.97 552.22 B: mhm 

554.01 554.84 B: right 

554.18 569.01 A: and a lot of 'em they uh because the resources aren't there for the computers and the education is not there they don't want their ki- they teach there and they don't want their kids going there and they they have fake addresses in fact they caught a bunch of them and they they let 'em go 

559.32 560.36 B: mhm 

563.62 564.72 B: right 

568.93 570.21 B: well 

569.42 570.66 A: they let 'em go 

570.49 571.88 B: well 

570.88 572.21 A: but uh 

573.01 584.94 A: [lipsmack] you know i don't know what they do that in the other like e- like the public officials here have to live in the city [mn] you know even have you been to buffalo it's not not the greatest area to live in but i mean it's not bad but i mean it you 

577.92 578.88 B: mhm 

582.55 584.94 B: no i've only been i've only been to rochester [sigh]
