242.20 244.66 A: um yeah you're right

279.71 280.88 B: oh wow 

280.68 295.39 A: i i think the media's pushing it a little bit too far with that also but you know the medias the media and the media has to make money you know everybody needs to read a magazine everybody you know needs to read something on them and that that's how it is um 

295.40 307.57 B: like inner city as far as graffiti goes i've seeing a lot of like stencils like like stop bush and bush nazi and and like all over like telephone booths and on just like the sidewalk i i've seen a lot of that [noise] 

295.59 296.72 A: i [mn] 

305.99 314.83 A: yeah you know but i mean bush is all right um i didn't like what he did at first when he er when he invaded iraq 

314.62 320.54 A: um but when you see the outcome um [noise] y- you have to think about it he pretty much had no choice 

320.31 333.33 A: um he's trying to at least trying to keep er america stabilized he's trying to keep the world stabilized in peace i mean from from war and you know terrorists things like that so i mean in h- in his in his position i think 

333.47 343.10 A: any president would have went to war i don't know if it would have been with iraq you know um but any president would have went to war and he probably did the right thing 

343.36 345.85 B: [noise] what do you how do you feel about the next election 

345.54 349.15 A: [noise] the next election [noise] um well [mn]

355.46 362.97 A: [laughter] you know it's crazy and um you know bush hasn't really been doing too well with our economy but um 

362.89 371.14 A: [lipsmack] [noise] right now i think that he may get my vote only because of what he started with er operation 

370.96 373.14 A: iraqi freedom and things like that 

372.96 377.19 A: um i i feel he's probably the best man who could finish the job 

376.97 385.79 A: um i think that he's ruthless and that's which you pretty much need er we need somebody ruthless at this time i don't think we need a clinton 

385.60 396.34 A: who would be you know a little more mellow about the subject and worry more about the economy i think we need somebody who who's there to protect us because you could see i mean it's crazy 

396.10 406.44 A: they just found one of saddam's agents in chicago like last week you know so anything is possible and and bush is the man who i think can clean things up 

405.35 411.22 B: mm [noise] senator clinton did some military action while he was in office i mean he sent [noise] those like fire bombs over there but 

410.26 416.28 A: [noise] [noise] it wasn't enough you know i um it wasn't it definitely wasn't enough um 

415.21 418.69 B: [mn] well the media they most definitely did make a big thing out of it 

418.12 424.40 A: no oh yeah of course yeah definitely with that and yes also yeah you're right 'cause er 

424.30 431.04 A: i don't think without the media we would not know what al qaeda is we would not know the numbers 

430.89 441.42 A: and i think right now s- after nine eleven i think people started to realize that al qaeda's not just a hole in the wall i mean these these guys are strong you know 

431.00 431.65 B: (( wh- yeah )) 

441.20 452.28 A: um you kill one cell and they'll grow another cell i mean there's people that's willing to train and willing to learn from them every day you know a new person so [noise]
