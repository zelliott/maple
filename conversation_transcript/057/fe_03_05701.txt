1.00 2.12 A: hello 

1.68 2.84 B: hello 

2.94 4.73 A: (( hi how are you my name is ashley )) 

4.49 5.64 B: i'm josh 

5.51 7.59 A: (( how ya doing so where are you based )) 

7.19 8.89 B: ah new york city 

8.33 9.52 A: (( oh me too )) 

9.22 9.95 B: (( are you )) 

9.70 12.08 A: yeah because i i'm i'm in soho 

10.18 10.95 B: (( cool )) 

11.91 15.64 B: (( ah that's real that's cool yeah i'm on the upper east side )) 

14.40 18.26 A: upper east side so wha- so what are you thoughts on the american foreign policy right now 

18.09 19.68 B: what's that 

18.88 21.75 A: what are your thoughts on the american foreign policy right now 

21.26 21.85 B: (( [mn] )) 

21.97 24.12 B: um well um 

24.29 27.90 B: ah i i i don't know i mean i i i'm ah 

28.60 32.30 B: i i i feel like there are a lot of secrets being kept from us 

32.11 34.40 A: (( yeah i really agree with you on that )) 

33.56 34.87 B: um 

34.97 45.18 B: i feel like i i feel like this is one of those times in american history where um like in the future we're going to find out a lot of like 

45.22 50.20 B: you know shit that's going down that we don't know about like thirty years from now 

48.50 51.97 A: mhm yeah i i i think that's fair enough 

51.59 54.38 B: like cuban missile crisis type stuff 

54.89 66.92 A: yeah i mean i i really don't think there is a threat to america right now um unless america wants it and i think the more they start banging the war drum in the middle east you know the greater the threat is 

66.75 71.29 A: and i i think the only thing that's ever going to happen is that it's going to be nine eleven again 

71.27 84.73 A: um and that's that's really a question is that a threat at all i mean i mean i think america's a country that it's it's never going to be under threat because it's a it's you know no-one else can compete with it but occasionally you'll have skirmishes where people will feel unsafe 

74.70 77.32 B: (( why yeah )) 

84.73 87.93 A: and that's that's seems pretty standard in any country right now 

87.55 96.77 B: i guess i guess i agree with that um to to a certain extent although i mean every time i think about nine eleven i always think of the i always think of the roman empire 

96.71 98.99 A: you do what what makes you d- do that 

98.39 106.39 B: well you know because um you know the at the time you know people would people said you know well 

106.24 118.17 B: you know there can't be a threat to the roman empire i mean you know it's the you know it's it's the greatest you know you know empire the world has ever seen and how could it ever crumble and how could it ever 

113.57 114.54 A: yeah 

118.07 124.35 B: you know how i you know and then and you know i mean and eventually you know it did you know it's just 

118.84 120.51 A: mhm 

124.23 130.66 A: i i mean i i it's it's kinda [laughter] it's a it's a good analogy but i i i think in some way it's it's 

131.00 137.80 A: it's misplaced because america to a large degree it is since nine eleven it's probably becoming more roman 

138.10 145.86 A: um in the sense that troops are now being de- deployed overseas where they weren't where they weren't before so some of it is like 

142.63 144.43 B: yeah 

145.85 156.78 A: it's like the roman empire in in reverse i i mean i don't think as a super power america's ever going to be threatened because i think that's as you know as time goes on economic power is going to be more important 

156.63 169.46 A: and if you look at the the fact of the of of nine eleven it's been more economic than actual you know in terms of it was very sad that a lot of people died but i mean i think the i think the real impact has been economic 

157.93 161.11 B: (( yeah )) 

166.88 171.96 B: right i i i absolutely agree i mean 

172.04 177.82 B: because if you really think it and it sounds kind of callous and horrible but you know how many people really did die 

177.96 183.94 B: ah you know in in nine eleven the only thing that it really did was just scare the crap out of us 

183.67 184.62 A: yeah 

184.00 192.31 B: and um and and and in doing that um they accomplished their goal you know they didn't really kill all that many people 

192.09 203.87 B: i i mean comparatively i mean how many people has you know how many people have died eh you know in foreign lands by a you know at the hands of you know american troops as compared to how many people have died 

200.58 201.40 A: sure 

203.64 207.36 B: you know in america you know at the hands of you know 

205.37 206.80 A: (( but i mean )) 

207.51 213.77 B: i mean what they did basically was scare was scare us to death and and set us into a recession you know 

212.66 219.58 A: yeah i mean we were already in a recession i i i'd be curious actually to see what the ah ro- road fatalities were 

216.83 222.04 B: yeah we were already on our way into we were already on our way into a recession but this really helped 

221.26 223.12 A: this really kicked us but i 

222.25 223.60 B: pushed us along 

223.34 235.55 A: but i mean some of one of my pals sai- reckon and i i don't know what it is but he says if you were to look at the amount of people killed in car crashes in the u._s. in any given calendar year there's probably more killed in car crashes than were killed [laughter] in nine you know 

234.47 238.64 B: oh of course of course yeah 

235.53 239.93 A: in nine eleven so that that kinda put it in in in perspective 

239.31 249.79 B: well absolutely i mean and and you you know i mean i i guess i mean i guess you're right i mean you know i more than anything else i guess americans are friendly just sort of 

249.86 262.84 B: bi- have become aware how much people don't like americans because i i i think the whole sort of like you know the whole stereo type of you know the overseas like the ugly american you know 

262.32 263.28 A: yeah 

262.62 275.01 B: um i i mean it was you know americans in general i think especially in the midwest and and what i'm i only say that because i'm from the midwest um were sort of oblivious to that you know stereo type 

273.69 279.11 A: oh yeah d- do do you think do you think things would be different if gore was in the white house 

278.66 281.97 B: do i think things would be different if gore was in the white house 

281.12 282.73 A: mhm 

283.22 293.10 B: you know i don't know honestly i i i was i'm not a i i mean i don't i'm not a republican but um i'm actually a registered independent 

292.90 293.82 A: right 

293.07 300.75 B: um and ah i and i i don't i really didn't want to vote for either one of those guys i ha- 

299.89 305.99 A: no no i mean i i don't mean that you know if gore was in the white house nine eleven wouldn't have happened 

305.05 312.81 B: no no but do you think that do do i think that he would have handled it differently do do i think that he w- that we wouldn't have like gone to war with iraq 

312.83 316.31 B: um i think i think that there are i think that i don't know i mean 

316.69 324.47 B: i i think that there would have been some kind of a police action of of some kind because i mean i think that enough people 

324.48 331.92 B: like just you know after nine eleven just hated middle easterners you know people from 

330.18 342.75 A: right but it's it's a very it's a very tenuous link though because if you if you were to look at it um objectively the the link between iraq and nine eleven at the at the most it's it's it's a leap of faith it's very tenuous i mean 

339.63 345.89 B: it's very it's very it's very tenuous but but but that's but but you know 

344.49 346.46 A: (( well )) 

345.90 350.20 B: unfortunately that doesn't really matter sometimes you know i mean like 

349.82 352.27 A: why why wasn't saudi arabia bombed 

352.06 356.85 B: exact- oh exactly why wasn't why wasn't saudi arabia bombed you know why wasn't ah 

356.85 368.08 B: you know um i mean i yeah exactly i mean i mean that's where that's actually where um os- os- osama bin laden is from you know so [laughter] 

365.68 375.60 A: right and i mean a a lot of the a lot of the ah you know the the bombers they're the the al qaeda members are reg- held saudi saudi passports 

375.84 378.17 B: yeah exactly 

376.76 382.60 A: you know it'd sorta be a much it's a much stronger link to saudi arabia than than there would be to afghanistan 

381.95 392.41 B: yeah i mean i don't know you know i mean like i have a feeling that you know and maybe it sounds kinda farfetched but you know i mean george w. bush has has so many of his you know his father's 

392.45 393.58 B: you know 

393.13 394.31 A: advisers 

393.90 401.24 B: advisers and cabinet members working for him that it's almost like they have a hard on for this guy from the you know from the first time they went after him 

394.85 396.88 A: mhm 

399.91 410.53 A: yeah i i i think i thi- i think that's completely true as well i mean i mean i mean i think part of it if you look at it it's you know the defence the defence budget got flasher in the clinton era 

403.71 405.51 B: i i just 

410.43 423.27 A: now it's it's three hundred and fifty five billion every year for the next seven years think with a with a guaranteed five per cent increase so i think there's there's to to a degree it's it's the old ad- adage of like it's a political economic it's a 

423.25 426.03 A: it's a political decision it's also an economic decision 

425.61 428.24 B: oh absolutely yeah i totally agree 

426.68 432.39 A: and and i mean i i think if gore is in the white house i i think it would be very different personally 

431.66 440.84 B: well yeah i mean yeah i i guess it would be i mean although although i mean like wh- what it boils down to is that whether gore or or bush 

440.83 453.15 B: is in the white house right now we'd we'd be in a recession either way i mean you know after after the whole internet bubble thing burst i mean it was like that's you know it's like we set ourselves up for it really 

443.90 445.62 A: oh yeah 

453.11 465.96 B: you know i mean it it isn't as huge a thing i think that happened in the nineteen twenties but i think it's sort of the same thing except on a smaller scale you know i mean we were dealing with like imaginary money for the latter part of the nineteen nineties 

460.73 462.51 A: mhm 

465.89 470.15 B: you know all of these internet companies that were supposedly worth like 

470.22 471.97 A: billions yeah 

470.50 481.57 B: hundreds of millions of dollars w- you know and and these people you know and that was imaginary money that money never existed it was ju- all on paper or even just you know in cyber space 

480.85 482.14 A: mhm 

481.48 494.99 B: you know and all of a sudden things actually started not working and it all goes downhill and this happens and it just sort of pushes it along i mean yeah i i guess things would be different if if gore was in the white house they'd have to be you know but 

493.48 500.88 A: d'you i mean i do you thi- i mean i not necess- i i think the big difference is i don't think foreign policy would be as aggressive as it is 

500.67 507.42 B: no you're you're absolutely right it it it wouldn't be yeah i i i definitely agree with that i definitely agree with that yeah 

507.35 519.62 B: um i actually i work in a wine store here in new york city and i still have people coming into my store who refuse to buy french wine [laughter] and just they that's the most 

515.12 521.85 A: french wine yeah [laughter] do they do they do they order freedom fries at mcdonald's 

520.79 524.95 B: [laughter] i know is that the most ridiculous thing you ever heard 

524.59 526.19 A: (( that is )) 

525.19 538.96 B: it it just it makes it makes me so angry i just want to like i want to like break bottles over their head it's i i that's the most that's the most asinine thing i think i that happened out of this whole experience with the whole like 

538.75 540.78 B: anti french sentiment 

540.18 542.24 A: mhm 

540.90 545.75 B: it's like it's almost like people were just like looking for an excuse to be mad at french people 

545.82 554.93 B: ah you know i mean like i just don't understand it you know i just 

548.83 554.36 A: well i i think if you if you're going back to the if you look at what happened you know 

554.39 562.36 A: when bush was in power prior prior prior to nine eleven any sort of political treaty that came along from from an international perspective 

562.48 565.68 A: america opted out of it it opted out of um 

565.86 571.41 A: to do with pollution it was opting out you know it was like we don't need to be involved in that and then 

567.57 569.39 B: yeah absolutely 

570.46 574.26 B: right so we were basically doing the same thing that france was doing 

573.60 581.69 A: right but it was like france was saying come on in the european union was saying come on in let's join this together and and the u._s. said it's it's not our problem you know 

581.65 591.02 A: you sort it out and then after nine eleven it became well you know we're all buddies and we want [laughter] [laughter] you know which is which is kind of strange 

582.69 584.00 B: yeah right 

586.29 589.33 B: yeah exactly exactly yeah 

590.50 599.89 B: yeah that's um yeah i i you know i that's that's something that i hadn't even thought about really is that you know we we really i mean that really was the stance and then all of a sudden
