0.65 1.94 B: yes hi 

1.69 3.81 A: hi i'm adam 

3.84 5.59 B: hi i'm eugene how are ya 

5.44 6.88 A: eugene good to meet ya 

7.11 8.83 B: (( same here same here )) 

8.74 13.67 A: yeah so what do you think about um i guess the topic is computers in education 

13.42 18.22 B: yes it is [noise] i actually think it's a good idea um computers have really helped [lipsmack] 

18.54 20.59 B: (( to learn at least in my experience )) 

21.27 22.06 B: um 

21.44 27.25 A: computers or or ah you mean computers in education or education in general is a good thing 

27.33 37.82 B: well i mean no computers using computers and using computerized learning in general as an approach to education i've found it extremely useful in the past 

32.88 33.73 A: mm 

37.18 39.72 A: yeah it's helped me um 

39.84 43.20 A: i think i have reservations about things like spell checker 

43.21 47.34 A: um which is great i use it all the time but um [lipsmack] 

43.28 45.16 B: oh really 

46.48 48.01 B: right 

47.43 48.65 A: you know ah 

48.66 55.63 A: i'm a writer so you know i i already know how to spell it's just a [noise] a nice sort of safety [noise] net but ah 

50.28 51.02 B: (( oh )) 

55.72 65.77 A: i think that in in a way although that it it it makes education easier [noise] to facilitate which is good [noise] because everybody should be able to get their hands on education you know 

65.50 67.37 B: (( right right )) 

65.76 77.23 A: um on the other hand it it would [noise] things like certain certain parts of it make it just so automatic and and ah run by the machine that the that the person is is left to do less and less 

72.80 74.39 B: right 

77.60 78.70 B: (( yeah i mean )) 

77.75 80.29 A: there's that element to it 

80.40 84.92 B: [lipsmack] i mean that's true i mean i'm in medical school right and i do 

84.48 86.29 A: oh yeah 

84.76 95.45 B: a lot lots of computerized education through business school and i mean it's good because you can do it in your own time it's your own tapes but you do all the contacts with the person behind 

92.81 93.69 A: (( mm )) 

95.76 109.81 A: [noise] yeah yeah um it is good to be able to yes online things are very good as far as education i guess i don't know if that's exactly the same as computers in education you know but um that's a wonderful resource you know 

95.79 97.25 B: (( it which )) 

105.38 107.40 B: is right that's 

109.98 120.49 B: and i mean you can't compare a typewriter to a computer in terms of you know ability to type and edit and print it's you know it's such a progress to the word processor 

115.89 117.67 A: yeah 

119.85 127.69 A: that is yeah that is a wonderful thing yeah that's made things so much smoother and easier when i i just got my b._a. only a few months ago 

127.70 132.81 A: and when i started like five years i've been through this whole you know business um 

127.72 128.59 B: (( oh )) 

132.85 138.12 A: when i started i was totally computer illiterate and i had a little word processor you know 

138.17 143.39 A: and um i had to gradually sort of pick up all that because it was what was expected you know 

138.20 138.85 B: yeah 

143.44 146.93 A: and it's actually really good i mean i'm glad i know it all you know 

146.98 151.10 B: (( yeah [noise] right yeah once you there's going back )) 

147.54 148.41 A: so 

150.30 157.58 A: yeah yeah it's particularly good with um if you're writing a paper being able to cut and paste and to move things around 

157.41 158.25 B: (( right right )) 

157.54 166.17 A: i think it's a very good thing compared to sort of writing it all first and trying to sort of formulate those things [noise] it does make things easier [noise] 

166.13 173.01 B: yeah i agree i mean i never write a paper the way it going s- you know wound up at the end i think it's always moving around things 

172.97 174.74 A: yeah 

173.88 182.35 B: i mean i'm i'm actually personally very happy about the spell checker it's just to help with typos and things i i tend to type without ah 

182.48 193.72 B: paying attention to what i'm typing specifically because i'm trying to you know express myself fast enough that before i forgot the thought and then when i read back sometimes you know it's the most difficult thing 

192.88 194.97 A: [laughter] and you read it back and you're like [mn] 

194.84 204.09 B: yeah did i write that [laughter] yeah so so that is good grammar check is yeah 

196.61 197.95 A: yeah 

199.74 203.68 A: yeah i i do like it i mean it's it's it's definitely for the better 

204.03 205.78 A: (( um yeah i mean )) 

204.68 206.64 B: the only issue i'd think 

206.19 207.03 A: sorry 

206.85 215.09 B: the main issue i see is the loss of personal touch with computerized learning and learning everything through the internet and courses on the computer 

213.12 214.04 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

215.42 224.26 A: yeah the only problem i guess with computers as far as education goes is it standardizes things you know if if you it it expects a standardized 

221.42 222.72 B: yeah that's 

224.31 229.95 A: um sort of level um with a lot of um the things that you're expected to produce 

230.12 238.05 A: um do you know what i mean and within that you could be very good or very bad and so on but it still kinda makes a standardized wash over everything 

234.49 240.56 B: right right makes makes everything sort of multiple choice 

240.78 242.47 A: yeah [noise] yeah [sigh] 

241.69 246.06 B: like for you you know you have less expression and 

246.19 255.60 B: just like in my experience you know all like there're many exams like standardized on computers just you know how they check you and grade you it's 

255.66 261.43 B: just you know not not the same like it's kind of constrictive though process 

260.56 262.28 A: yeah 

262.06 263.90 B: categories of answers 

263.95 265.78 A: yeah 

265.89 267.23 A: i think um 

267.47 272.66 A: it as far as personal education where you actually just find information for yourself 

272.51 274.11 B: (( right )) 

272.61 285.50 A: that's where computers and the internet particularly are amazing that's where it's really good you know where you yeah i do that all the time and and i have access to so much more than if i was going to get on the bus and go to the library you know 

276.44 279.60 B: (( yes pretty perfect yeah )) 

285.15 287.30 B: i know and having to park the 

285.56 289.53 A: and and i can do that but i mean it's so much more you know 

288.93 295.54 B: right and and even for the books i mean the search options on the internet like you can find a word on a page and 

289.89 290.75 A: (( [cough] )) 

295.44 305.17 B: habit to go through the book and like you know page by page i mean on the other hand you have to read the book you just find the quick way out so 

297.88 301.51 A: yeah yeah totally yeah 

304.81 319.27 A: yeah i actually learnt speed reading right at the beginning i did a this class i thought it would kinda goofy you know to do a speed reading class right at the beginning of my studies and i'm so glad i did it i thought it would be kinda funny but um 

307.66 309.13 B: (( right )) 

316.30 317.47 B: (( mm oh really [noise] )) 

319.28 328.87 A: ah or or maybe just a waste of time or maybe good you know but um it ended up being amazing because it's part of my job now i work as a researcher and 

328.78 334.65 A: they asked me to like read a novel in an hour and then find these various historical pieces that they want you know 

334.27 335.84 B: (( oh my god wow )) 

334.90 339.59 A: and and i do it i mean i don't read it i sort of speed read it and skim through it you know 

339.67 340.74 B: i've never 

339.78 340.91 A: but um 

340.77 346.98 B: believed in speed reading myself like in being l- trained to speed read but that's amazing 

346.16 351.89 A: well i'm not one of those guys like the guinness book of records characters that can literary claim they really read it you 

351.28 353.02 B: right 

351.95 358.62 A: i mean there's sort of different speeds you can read at you know d- d- depending on what you're trying to find but ah 

357.39 361.86 B: right so you're just searching for certain phases a certain concept 

361.62 366.16 A: yeah yeah i guess it's not really along the topic of what we're supposed to talk about but 

362.54 363.39 B: about 

364.69 366.97 B: the right [laughter] 

366.57 367.75 A: [laughter] 

367.38 370.13 B: well the computers in so that's that's 

370.57 372.34 A: yeah 

370.68 373.64 B: computers do my speed reading for me 

373.41 379.46 A: yeah i think like most things though that if you if you are someone who's motivated um 

379.37 393.96 A: you just excel more so in a way um the fact that things are so much um more facilitated by computers and and everything is is is so much more accessible that that he- helps lazy people to get through without really doing 

393.98 404.33 A: you know what would have improved them you know without the computer they would have had to have learnt more but other people who already are more motivated and and more sort of learning oriented 

404.36 407.91 A: really excel because they don't have to waste their time you know 

408.00 414.76 B: yeah it's a tool either a tool and not realize it's only that not a substitute 

414.84 418.09 B: (( for learning )) 

415.33 416.51 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

416.91 422.83 A: yeah so it would help you in in in your studies 'cause that med- medical studies right 

422.15 435.71 B: so oh yes i mean it's i i can search through like millions of journals and like find specific articles and like you know just build course reference and it shows me what's you know what what's available besides the fact 

428.71 429.46 A: (( [cough] mm )) 

436.56 441.47 B: it just saves times tremendously it really does 

440.78 442.58 A: yeah 

442.99 444.59 B: (( and )) 

443.13 449.20 A: yeah and of course we've started this phone thing only speaking to a computer [laughter] 

448.38 454.36 B: right right yeah how funny and 

449.26 453.69 A: that's amazing you know the way that's all done it's like sci fi i 

454.48 457.20 B: that and then parts of their research will 

454.50 458.12 A: mean i'm old enough to remember the difference [laughter] sorry 

458.21 461.14 B: and it's part of their research project through a university 

461.90 465.56 A: yeah yeah yeah it's all sort of getting in everywhere 

465.35 471.43 B: right yeah and it's kinda amazing what the world would be like without computers at this point 

467.33 468.15 A: um 

471.44 483.39 A: yeah people talk about a paperless world coming you know like i had a professor who was sort of all about being paperless so all of all the all the essays are handed in by email and everything is done without paper 

483.52 493.24 A: and it's an interesting idea you know because en- environmental obviously um [noise] but it's it's pretty radical when you think of the difference that would make you know 

487.32 490.09 B: (( [noise] )) 

492.98 500.11 B: (( right right right and it's if you think about what happens if there's like a major blackout but you know it's just it goes out )) 

500.24 503.64 A: i'm sorry i didn't hear you i lost the signal for a second 

500.26 501.90 B: and 

503.04 509.10 B: oh sure i i'm just saying that it would be interesting you know if in the paperless world you know if there's a power surge 

509.42 515.48 A: [laughter] yeah yeah of course another thing [noise] that's a weird thing is that um computers 

515.79 518.56 A: you still don't know how much you damage your eye 

517.78 519.66 B: (( yeah yeah right )) 

518.70 526.64 A: if you're starring at a screen that's literally shooting rays of light at you and you do it all day like i do and you probably do as well um 

526.69 531.66 A: you know i mean we do still don't know 'cause it's like you know twenty years old or less this whole business 

531.84 537.97 A: so we don't know quite wh- how that's gonna work i'm a bit old fashioned i like paper you know i use both you know 

537.67 539.06 B: (( right how much )) 

537.98 544.55 A: i use computers a hell of a lot and the internet a lot but i i still reading a book with paper you know 

543.84 546.82 B: i agree i cannot read a book on a computer 

547.00 550.87 B: if if i find my eyes hurt i have to print it out and read it on paper 

547.29 549.05 A: yeah 

550.13 551.22 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

551.28 552.64 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

551.64 556.71 B: because i don't want to be tied to the machine i want to you know sit down in my chair 

556.97 558.23 A: yeah 

557.56 562.28 B: have my own personal space that's not possible with a computer on a table 

561.57 575.32 A: yeah yeah one thing that's good about computers that that's always fascinated me is that when something is a copy it's an identical copy and you can copy that identical copy and it will always be the same y- you know where it's like 

575.46 582.07 A: e- before computers everything diminished the more you copied it whether it was a photograph or a xerox copy 

580.32 582.01 B: (( that's right like quality )) 

582.21 585.91 A: yeah and that that's an interesting thing you know 

585.76 588.12 B: (( like for pur- purposes )) 

587.88 590.16 A: yeah yeah 

589.73 593.56 B: on the other hand you can edit everything much easier than you could on paper 

593.45 596.21 A: yeah yeah um 

597.02 599.89 A: i have had professors that been so obsessed with
