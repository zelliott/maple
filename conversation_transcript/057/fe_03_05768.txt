14.65 15.30 B: (( thoughts )) 

15.66 19.89 A: well i think computers are very very useful to education actually 

19.61 20.42 B: (( right )) 

20.50 24.59 A: you know it ah it brings in a lot more resources to the school 

24.99 28.64 A: than ah traditional ah media will do you know 

28.30 29.07 B: right 

30.18 31.84 A: so what do you think 

31.26 34.73 B: (( right well being a student firsthand i can honestly tell you )) 

34.86 40.25 B: (( computers make a big difference 'cause i remember when i was like at elementary school you know we really didn't there was really no internet )) 

40.73 51.46 B: there was no internet yet and um you know you know have to go to the library for hours try to look for this try to look for that and now that you have the computer right at your hand you have the internet access 

51.29 58.09 B: and you're able to um i don't know it makes things a lot easier because you know going to a library and this and that you know you're restricted to hours 

58.06 67.21 B: and and weather conditions 'cause depending on how far you had to go but like if you had the internet everything is right at your house you don't have to go nowhere you can do it as long as you need to find out what ever you need 

68.57 73.05 A: but what do you think about ah the possibility that what you see on the internet 

73.19 77.12 A: may not be correct with a lot of the stuff on on the internet 

77.17 79.92 A: is basically put by people you don't know whether 

79.98 80.83 B: (( it's it's )) 

80.16 83.06 A: whatever what they say is correct or not you know 

82.51 87.40 B: well the one good thing with you do have like a lot of reliable sources you can go to 

87.46 91.61 B: (( like sometimes if you can see something that says like if you're doing )) 

91.52 99.92 B: a paper on like tigers you know you would probably you go to national geographic website or something that could be related to the 

96.19 97.12 A: okay 

99.82 106.96 B: information you could tell who did the credible sources from the sources that are not credible 'cause you know that credible sources do usually have 

101.18 101.84 A: (( okay )) 

107.21 115.03 B: website like the national geographic would compared to like a lot of these homemade pages where a lot of the facts won't be the most accurate 

114.25 115.92 A: (( mhm )) 

115.09 116.65 B: you know you can just tell 

117.14 124.45 A: there are a lot of independent ones they use of them you know the student has to be careful and smart enough to realize that sometimes 

120.94 122.03 B: yeah 

124.46 131.92 A: there's a lot of stuff out there that people think they are experts on something you know and they'll post ah some information and you you know that it's not true 

127.78 128.61 B: right 

131.48 132.58 B: right 

132.06 136.21 A: (( because they are not really experts they are just because they got some reasons to do it you know )) 

135.72 141.86 B: right and also it's even a good thing to do it from home and then you have your parents there to help out because 

141.82 146.91 B: you know go to a library you know you probably have like four or five librarians working depending on how big the library is 

146.72 147.59 A: yeah 

146.82 153.89 B: and you have like thousand the week and it may explain to you like what sites are good and what sites are not and how to break down information 

152.30 153.32 A: mhm 

153.72 165.24 B: otherwise you know you have your parents or you have a brother or sister or somebody that can be like you know just go here or go there you know people that could give you the best advice for it and that that's introduction of where to get information from 'cause i 

164.72 167.40 A: (( that's true yeah now are you a student by any chance )) 

166.90 168.12 B: (( yeah i'm a student )) 

168.17 170.47 A: oh yeah which grade what grade level 

170.08 173.94 B: i'm a i'm going to be a junior next year in in college 

173.27 175.07 A: in high school or college 

174.27 175.59 B: (( yeah college )) 

175.50 180.31 A: (( oh okay well that's you know i i think for the college it is very very useful you know )) 

179.74 183.27 B: oh very because ah another thing is when it comes to writing papers 

180.93 181.67 A: yeah 

183.60 187.84 B: ah i i don't have a computer yet so like 

188.27 191.96 B: (( to type it and it was usually a pain the butt because um )) 

192.08 200.41 B: i'd be up there typing it and you know you make one mistake you have you have you know some keyboards have they they they're not modernized with that eraser on it 

200.34 210.79 B: and you got other typewriters that didn't so it's like it was really a pain but i didn't even have spell checks so if you have like a word that was misspelled you have to go back you couldn't go back you know 

208.90 209.46 A: (( [mn] )) 

210.20 211.39 A: that's right yeah 

211.13 223.40 B: um now they got the computers have got the automatic spell check which is excellent just click it on and it goes through everything tell you this tell you that and it makes it a lot easier because you don't have to sit up there for hours you know typing typing 

220.29 221.14 A: (( yep )) 

224.44 229.23 A: (( you can basically download and you know you can just cut and paste too )) 

228.98 231.52 B: yeah that yeah it is it 

231.89 233.82 A: saves a lot of typing you know 

233.40 236.31 B: yeah oh tons of it [noise] 

235.22 236.54 A: that's right yeah 

236.79 242.50 A: and and also a lot of things that you know like ah they're already now like universities you would like 

242.87 245.28 A: finish they've got a big program 

245.04 246.01 B: mhm 

245.51 247.92 A: can get your degree on the internet you know 

247.28 261.83 B: (( oh yeah it makes it makes it easy like that you know you just study at home it's ah you know you might have a disability or you know you've had a major crash and you couldn't go the classroom and there are schools now that ah you know you can take classes online and you're not having to leave your house you just you know )) 

248.71 249.61 A: (( but )) 

256.05 256.74 A: (( mhm )) 

263.12 265.74 B: course work and everything and everything and um 

265.85 267.75 B: (( you know you just basically relax )) 

267.66 268.78 A: mhm 

268.82 269.86 B: um 

270.11 271.27 B: but i will 

273.54 274.35 B: (( a point )) 

275.11 277.88 B: but i'll come back to it [laughter] ah 

278.38 280.12 B: but yeah but it's it's 

280.21 282.57 B: (( college it's easy and especially )) 

283.13 287.78 B: (( you know it's easy for professors to see what's going on you know 'cause it's you know )) 

288.14 289.49 B: and stuff like that it's 

289.65 290.36 B: (( very )) 

290.59 292.22 B: (( easy [noise] )) 

292.69 301.38 B: oh one more good option too for me is um you're able to you know it's actually you're able to talk to like your professors and teachers online you know 'cause there are questions 

300.74 308.99 A: (( well that's one thing i like you are right yeah i'm going to mention that is like professors are are now online and you can ema- email them your papers )) 

303.35 304.35 B: yeah 

306.17 306.97 B: yeah 

308.53 309.85 B: yeah 

309.26 312.32 A: (( and ah things like that too mhm [noise] )) 

310.70 315.60 B: yeah 'cause i got i got a few professors that can make it emailing them papers and they're so 

316.05 319.27 B: ah may have the class monday you may not meet until like friday 

319.46 330.24 B: you know it could be that you've you got a question about a paper it's like the professor so and so so and so they can respond to you within a day or two so you don't have to you know go out your way and try to break your neck in trying to find the professor to speak to them 

330.37 334.64 B: you know so i that really makes it that really really makes it convenient mm 

331.14 332.28 A: (( oh yeah )) 

335.90 346.72 A: and ah i mean with me the computers have been very useful wherever i am you know i i'm i'm not in school anymore i'm i'm like sixty one years old you know but i use it a lot for even when i travel you know 

343.53 344.38 B: uh-huh 

346.31 347.37 B: yeah 

346.89 353.61 A: ah i take my laptop with me and ah wherever i am i'm still accessible and my emails and my 

348.87 350.01 B: mhm 

352.83 353.67 B: right 

353.67 356.29 A: my stock stuff and all that you know but 

355.12 357.83 B: yeah and ah i think the main thing is 

357.85 362.95 B: if you think about it you know i think it comes down to that it saves a lot of time 

363.05 366.50 B: you know from writing letters and you know getting business 

367.02 372.85 B: you know bang bang you know in thirty seconds especially if you've got an emergency letter or something you know 

368.10 368.66 A: (( [mn] )) 

368.97 370.65 A: that's true yeah 

373.08 377.12 B: (( it's ah it has been good for you know aspects like that )) 

378.05 380.88 A: (( d- d- do you live in as well or do you live outside )) 

380.41 382.84 B: i live i live at home i'm with my my parents 

382.14 387.68 A: oh so you live at home so so a lot of homes now have also high speed access you know 

383.41 384.26 B: yeah 

387.21 395.64 B: yeah to yeah to dial in the the internet yeah yeah even at at home you know they have like a cable um the cable companies verizon 

389.16 390.59 A: (( online you know )) 

395.65 399.51 B: (( you have that high speed connection )) 

398.20 400.39 A: that's right they've got a cable you are right yes 

399.91 408.18 B: because i i up the modem the modem [laughter] once you have that high speed in- internet access you don't want to go back to the modem it's like going back to the stone age 

407.07 410.55 A: you are right it's so fast you know you sort of you get used to it 

410.69 414.47 A: and then if you go to a modem you know like dial up you really get ah 

414.21 415.67 B: (( you get frustrated )) 

414.96 415.98 A: (( frustrated )) 

415.95 419.19 B: the computer almost like you know you 

418.12 419.61 A: that's right yeah 

419.72 421.29 B: know but it's um 

422.31 427.08 B: i mean also you know you can just email attachments to papers and you 

427.48 429.93 B: know stuff like that so it's really a big plus 

430.20 436.89 A: yeah if you send so much so much stuff like the work on the on the an attachment you're right yeah yeah 

436.37 441.04 B: (( yeah but um anything to do with internet ah )) 

441.52 445.72 B: (( educational wise it's it's it's i think this is a time that's going to make kids )) 

446.81 448.96 B: a lot like um 

449.32 454.84 B: i feel that most schools you know they don't have it they have to get it because it makes their education a lot easier 

454.02 468.63 A: well like i said my the only reason the only main reason i see is that a lot of stuff that comes out you don't know who's putting it out you know and yeah and and and as a user you've gotta be careful what you see so you wanna make sure that ah 

461.67 463.03 B: yeah 

468.83 471.47 A: ah it's it's it's valid you know 

471.02 472.57 B: (( yeah but )) 

471.79 473.26 A: (( ah [mn] because )) 

473.35 477.42 A: some people think that when it comes from the computer it must be right you know 

476.99 487.28 B: (( yeah but it but it no it in that case to be safe in terms of common sense the websites isn't it you could say homemade ones and and the professional companies )) 

477.65 479.06 A: but that's not true 

487.30 488.52 B: (( that's usually )) 

488.96 490.56 B: (( that's usually )) 

489.29 492.09 A: but yeah yeah 

492.51 495.48 A: okay well let's just wait for the time to go up i guess
