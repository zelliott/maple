7.40 21.01 A: [mn] ah family's very important to me of course and you know i have a fairly large extended family and ah you know [mn] really nothing's more important than family they're the people ultimately who are who'll back you up the most 

20.96 34.83 B: ah this is true ah i i i have ah a unique perspective on this i mean i'm very close with my immediate family family's definitely important to me i my myself i'm thirty five single never been married um 

34.66 35.58 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

34.92 44.88 B: but um my parents you know my mom and dad i was blessed to have a loving mom and dad i had a great childhood and that's very important and now 

44.81 46.31 B: as i reach 

46.19 49.96 B: [mn] the the stage in my life where i possibly you know i be looking for 

49.75 57.56 B: a mate i find that in my dating pi- history looking at the girls that i've dated compared [mn] 

57.46 66.90 B: to some of the relationships that where they went a long time or a short time the ones i've had the family a strong family have lasted the longest 

66.70 75.09 B: so i guess i i'm even looking for um uh extended family in terms of my ah mate even being close with her family 

74.45 84.42 A: [mn] that's interesting i never thought of that but i marri- i'm actually married i've been married almost i've been married over three years now um my wife comes from a very small family so [mn] she was an only child 

84.50 89.09 A: and like her family's almost non existent so i kind of sucked her into mine 

88.91 89.85 B: right 

89.35 90.57 A: [laughter] 

90.02 91.04 B: mhm 

90.67 94.93 A: but her parents have a very stable marriage in fact more stable than my parents 

94.83 95.90 B: right 

95.12 100.43 A: so ah so that that works out well but i i think having a good family background helps 

100.05 113.68 B: right yeah i i i think it does too i mean there are no guarantees in life but i tell you what you can't i mean you can't underestimate the value of f- of family [mn] in terms i'm i grew up an only child too but ah 

113.72 117.81 B: [mn] but the crazy thing about me being an only child was my 

117.89 119.73 B: [mn] ah i had a coupla 

119.56 134.18 B: [mn] cousins on my mom's side of the family where i have some mental mental illness and a death happened in the family the father of the ah the father of my cousins died and my mom's sister um

140.28 150.22 B: um my mom took into our home [mn] but my mom was also caretaker of her sister and the other child who was also suffering some mental illness 

150.13 160.78 B: so i almost had like an extended family ah in the sense that ah i've always had them around and this happened when i was like six years old so 

160.54 165.54 B: even though i technically am an only child i don't really consider myself to be one 

165.57 169.88 B: because i grew up with that you know with that bond with my two cousins 

169.27 171.82 A: yeah certainly if they lived in the house do 

170.98 177.15 B: right they live in the house graduated high school i mean there there's not that much of age difference between us 

176.93 187.57 B: they're like two or three years older than i am so we grew up i mean especially growing up in the south ah where i grew up i mean we were real close we done a lot of stuff together 

187.53 190.30 A: they consider your mom more almost more their mom 

187.64 188.42 B: and

338.36 340.98 A: (( i i was ah i was only in my late twenties )) 

340.45 346.28 B: you were only in your late twenties now you were you and your dad close when you were growing up 

341.72 342.83 A: yeah 

345.71 349.39 A: on and off i was probably closer to my mom and my mom's side of the family 

349.01 351.84 B: okay and it's the reason why 

351.48 355.51 A: i just found they were you know warmer people than my dad's side 

355.41 356.40 B: okay 

356.23 364.31 A: sometimes you know it you know a little crazy sometimes but in in a in a in a pretty good way but definitely easier to deal with 

361.96 363.05 B: well i think 

364.12 365.28 B: um 

365.77 372.06 B: you know that's kind of funny because [mn] i mean [mn] there are a lot of different aspects to family ah like for instance um 

372.17 375.63 B: i'm a lot of my family i'm an aspiring actor 

375.27 376.28 A: mhm 

375.70 381.98 B: and i used to be a sportscaster so a lot of people think that i'm crazy right now i'm trying to pursue this you know 

380.06 380.89 A: (( [noise] )) 

382.06 389.24 B: you know um i gave up a career to try to pursue that [mn] and so i'm looking for a lot of those reasons i 

389.12 399.01 B: i don't i don't get a chance to go to many family reunions as often as i should but at the same time they're dear in my heart but um 

399.32 406.23 B: i don't [mn] necessarily desire to be around a lot of 'em sometime [laughter] i um i'm more 

403.45 405.14 A: [laughter] 

406.09 418.98 B: i'm more into the mom dad i'm really all about that i mean i love my mom and dad i like being around them i [mn] you know i wish i could have the best of both worlds i wish i could go pursue my dreams and yet still 

418.91 426.36 B: maintain a bond with my mom and dad 'cause my dad is like eighty one and my mom is like fifty seven so there was like a big age difference 

425.42 427.45 A: that's a huge age difference yeah 

426.80 434.33 B: yeah [mn] and ah my dad you know i kinda wanted to have kids and be married by the time my dad passed away 

434.26 447.65 B: but at the same time i also got a good enough bond with him that if something did happen to him there's no doubt in my mind that [mn] based on my belief system that he'd be with me no matter what you know 

446.68 448.66 A: yeah mhm 

448.13 455.62 B: so ah i mean i don't know how you still feel about how you feel about that with with your dad being deceased but ah 

455.71 456.91 B: (( but ah )) 

457.00 463.07 B: but um you know i haven't experienced that but i'm i'm also at peace with my dad right now 

461.26 461.84 A: (( let )) 

463.28 472.65 B: and ah my mom and dad they always weren't well they had a good marriage they've been married now for thirty seven years 

472.07 474.99 A: me ask you is it is it your dad's first marriage 

474.50 476.82 B: no second marriage actually 

476.84 483.51 B: no i [mn] so i do have half brothers [mn] ah half brothers and sisters i have three half sisters and a half brother 

483.54 486.83 B: and ah they live in the chicago area but you know something 

487.16 492.49 B: it we're not as close as we probably should be and that's unfortunate it 

491.36 496.26 A: [mn] that's tough sometimes i i i don't know i don't know if [mn] if their mother died or whether your 

493.01 494.04 B: is tough 

495.67 499.18 B: their mom died after their divorce 

498.70 499.97 A: oh okay 

499.44 507.65 B: and soon kinda soon after the divor- well a few years after the divorce and you know it wasn't a a a it wasn't a pleasant thing so 

507.79 513.51 B: ah [mn] it wasn't a happy divorce and they were in their teenage years when they divorced 

512.75 514.02 A: that's tough 

513.65 522.66 B: so that's tough so they've always had a little bitterness toward my dad but where they probably did work it out or they say they've worked it out but 

522.59 533.94 B: i don't know i i i think they still got some hea- deep heartfelt feelings in them my dad has also been deeply affected by that so 

534.21 538.36 B: [mn] me and him are definitely close i am definitely closer to him than 

538.55 539.84 B: than they are 

539.91 549.03 B: but at the same time i i i i really appreciate my mom allowing me to the the the chance to have 

544.05 544.82 A: (( [noise] )) 

549.06 559.73 B: to dad my dad is a good dad i mean he believes in you know taking the time the little league he was my little league coach all that stuff he did it all especially as i 

558.31 564.63 A: that's good sometimes sometimes though dads are sometimes in the second batch they're a lit- they they learn from their mistakes from the first batch 

564.42 578.14 A: i don't i'm not saying this is your dad but i've seen this before where you see someone you see someone who like was either working so hard they never were around or they weren't that great the first time round then all of a sudden the second time round they just they you know they nail everything right 

567.93 569.47 B: i think he did 

577.84 579.43 B: what what's your name again
