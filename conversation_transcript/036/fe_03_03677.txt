0.25 2.22 A: hi this is anita 

1.96 3.48 B: hi i'm ellie 

4.07 5.08 A: um 

5.14 8.82 A: [mn] i do not [laughter] think that's enough um 

8.84 11.15 A: i live in the washington d._c. area 

10.64 11.67 B: okay 

11.52 16.74 A: and there's no way possible anybody can live off of [noise] five fifteen an hour so [laughter] 

15.11 17.26 B: i completely agree [laughter] 

17.16 18.29 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

17.85 28.87 B: i work in new york city and if i were making five fifteen an hour i i don't know [mn] i mean the- there's just no possible way you can even eat let alone have a place to live let alone commute to work 

28.88 32.61 B: you know it's it's just i don't know what they're thinking [laughter] 

32.56 39.63 A: yeah i you know i i guess maybe they're basing it on somewhere way out in utah or somewhere 

39.14 40.19 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] i )) 

39.75 43.34 A: [laughter] you can actually afford a house 

43.43 48.05 A: i mean the average price of a house around here is like three hundred thousand [noise] 

47.49 52.94 B: mean that's how how in the in the world would anybody save enough money for a down payment for a house 

53.13 65.10 B: it's just it's absurd to me but i don't know i i mean at least there is a minimum wage at least it's not one dollar per hour but still you know when you think about attorneys making three hundred dollars an hour 

65.19 71.38 B: and then these poor people making five fifteen an hour i mean i just i i i don't see how it's possible 

72.56 79.95 A: um i don't know like i mean this government is set up for the rich get richer and the poor get poorer [laughter] 

79.43 80.83 B: yeah i agree 

80.02 84.85 A: [laughter] and i mean and if you've got more than two kids well i mean 

84.87 92.20 A: just i mean it already costs like um they say it costs like three hundred thousand dollars to raise one kid 

91.74 93.98 B: really [laughter] oh jeez 

92.61 96.27 A: [noise] and if you're only making five fifteen an hour 

96.79 107.92 A: um you can't pay rent and pay for daycare i mean up here in virginia it costs two hundred dollars minimum a week for a a babysitter for a newborn 

107.61 108.92 B: oh my goodness 

108.73 114.97 A: yeah and i mean that's five fifteen an hour right there you're just working to pay the babysitter 

114.57 115.68 B: wow 

116.57 126.25 A: i mean unless you work a lot of overtime and you got like another job and [mn] you you couldn't possibly save for retirement you couldn't do anything 

125.78 126.92 B: (( that's true )) 

126.47 135.31 A: leave you no extra for anything you and i mean i've got um friends who don't have a lot of skills and they they didn't go to college and 

135.48 137.02 A: [noise] they're not you know 

137.21 143.25 A: i mean they got kids and they can't work at all they've just got to they have no choice but to stay home [noise] 

142.26 154.20 B: that's very sad see when it when it makes more sense for someone to stay home and perhaps be on welfare or you know some other type of assistance rather than work then that means that the government system really isn't working as well as it should be 

154.47 162.75 B: you know it should it the government system should should encourage people to to be able to make enough money if they're working [noise] it's just it's a shame 

162.89 169.53 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah [mn] it's just i don't even know where where they get the figures from um [cough] [laughter] 

167.40 181.42 B: [laughter] [laughter] like you said it's you know some little town in utah where you know the land is is less expensive and maybe people can live on that but in a big city like d._c. or new york city or you know san francisco people just can't live on that amount of money 

172.94 174.50 A: (( [noise] [mn] [laughter] )) 

174.86 175.94 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

181.43 193.99 A: well you know some have some states have their own minimum wage [noise] even though the government sets it i think california's is like seven fifty or eight dollars an hour which is a little more realistic but even in l._a. you 

184.73 185.92 B: right 

193.99 197.32 A: you can't afford a house [noise] you can't afford anything 

195.18 196.52 B: (( [laughter] no )) 

196.71 206.18 B: no maybe people are living out of their cars i mean it just it just i i don't know i i just [mn] to think of five fifteen an hour it just 

206.43 211.59 B: i'm really speechless you know to think about people wi- especially with families having to to live on that 

212.49 220.54 B: th- the only good thing is that they get raises [laughter] so at least you know you don't have to have five fifteen an hour forever it's just for to start out at least 

220.20 227.75 A: [noise] [mn] [laughter] [noise] oh well i mean [mn] you know i i work in a consulting firm and i make fifty two a year and it's still not enough 

227.24 228.39 B: really 

227.68 242.27 A: [noise] i've got two kids one's a teenager and we got a seven year old and he's in soccer cub scouts i mean there's all these fees for both the kids and i mean it's alwa- he has to pay i have pay for care for before and after school 

242.22 246.78 A: my mortgage my car note i mean it's never enough money it's 

245.99 251.53 B: i can see that with two kids driving them here and there paying for gas paying for shoes when they outgrow them 

251.48 252.81 A: (( yeah i mean )) 

251.63 258.34 B: and then imagine if you're making a lot of money like that and then these people are trying to do the same thing with with five fifteen an hour i mean 

258.53 259.56 B: i don't know 

259.46 267.11 B: ah the only thing the only good thing i think about the minimum wage is at least if for someone say in high school who starts out a job 

267.01 277.53 B: the the at least they can learn the value of money that's the only thing i think is a positive that you know this you know seventeen year old kid starts out at the ice cream store making you know five fifteen an hour what have you 

269.71 270.85 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

275.87 276.97 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

277.40 287.90 B: and then as he works harder or she you know gets a raise and they can see you know really what what his parents have to do to to provide for him and then perhaps that helps him in the future 

287.58 289.35 A: [noise] mhm 

288.02 290.87 B: you know just by knowing the value of a dollar 

291.08 294.95 B: but for an adult trying to do that it's it's just a lot more difficult 

294.66 298.75 A: [noise] well my daughter just got a summer job and 

298.99 303.87 A: it she hasn't started it yet but um it pays ten dollars an hour 

303.31 304.86 B: well that's good [laughter] 

304.16 315.45 A: and i mean i- i was thinking you know a lot of kids they don't want five fifteen an hour they won't even do it 'cause i mean if they can find something making seven fifty eight bucks an hour or whatever 

309.01 310.03 B: right 

310.23 311.15 B: right 

315.53 318.94 B: oh more power to them certainly certainly you know 

315.84 317.81 A: they don't want the minimum wage 

318.63 321.12 A: no reason to even have a minimum wage 

321.17 322.73 B: yeah i mean it's true 

321.60 324.05 A: [laughter] [laughter] so 

322.93 335.62 B: but the only thing is if there isn't a minimum people could even there could be you know cruel people who just decide to pay people you know nothing [laughter] now there is sweat shops and places like that where people you know are working for a couple of dollars an hour 

329.90 330.93 A: yeah 

335.58 343.24 B: because you know perhaps they're illegal or for whatever reason it's better than what they would make you know perhaps what country they're from 

341.77 343.35 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] [mn] [noise] )) 

343.92 349.45 B: so it you know it protects people to a certain point and then it really hurts people to another [laughter] 

348.84 355.35 A: yeah i mean it really should be based on where you live it i mean and the government should set that mandate 

355.44 367.76 A: and if you live in a [noise] a su- suburbs of a large city like [noise] like washington or new york it should be like ten dollars an hour if you live in kansas yeah it can be five fifteen 

367.06 368.44 B: [laughter] 

367.82 381.45 A: or [laughter] i don't know i have a co worker who lives here and um she lives in charlottesville and her house wasn't that expensive but she was making like eighty five thousand dollars a year [noise] and she was just driving like two hours to get home 

378.40 379.29 B: mhm 

381.13 382.25 B: oh jeez 

382.18 385.06 A: but her husband was out there in college 

384.80 385.87 B: okay 

385.09 388.25 A: and when he finished at at u._v._a. 

388.38 394.54 A: he took the big high paying job in kansas and her house cost like half what it cost here 

393.08 394.15 B: wow 

394.61 397.21 A: so she was able to just quit working 

397.08 398.79 B: well that's good 

397.39 398.31 A: but it 

398.80 411.31 A: but i mean it's just crazy you know a- and some of the people i mean like if you could telecommute yeah you can live in kansas and make a hundred thousand dollars a year and never have to worry about anything 

407.03 407.98 B: [laughter] 

411.59 418.36 A: but i mean not everybody's trained to do that and i mean people work in restaurants like right now in d._c. 

414.04 414.99 B: right 

418.50 425.00 A: the janitors are having this big strike thing the union or whatever because they won't give 'em benefits 

424.63 425.84 B: oh really 

425.59 433.55 A: [noise] yeah they're and then you know a lot of like custodian type people are getting ready to go on strike because nobody will give them health insurance or anything 

433.03 434.40 B: that's terrible 

434.67 438.22 A: and i mean they only make like six dollars an hour [laughter] 

437.70 445.51 B: i mean tha- that that makes me feel really terrible for them because they have to do all this they have to risk their jobs just to have health insurance 

444.93 445.92 A: mhm 

445.56 446.82 B: that's just i 

446.92 450.50 B: i i didn't hear about that strike and and that that really oh 

450.74 451.57 B: (( you know )) 

450.84 455.19 A: yeah it's just [noise] and then like i said they're like right above minimum wage they're like 

455.30 457.55 A: making hardly anything and 

456.73 471.25 B: and what they have to put up with too maybe kids being mean to them [laughter] and and just cleaning up after the kids in school you know kids can be be great and but they can be pretty you know snippety too [laughter] so at least let them have a good good paying job 

460.56 461.73 A: [laughter] 

467.47 469.72 A: yeah and i i think it 

469.90 482.59 A: i think it's not just um your school janitors i think it's also for people who clean like office buildings and stuff like that now i just can't imagine just you know cleaning up after people 

476.58 478.97 B: oh really oh wow 

482.70 492.83 A: all evening all you know all day at school and then you know if you get sick you can't even go to the doctor and you don't make you only make like [laughter] minimum wage 

492.32 494.95 B: yeah it really makes you feel like a second class citizen 

492.94 494.39 A: (( which is crazy )) 

494.99 502.36 A: yeah it is ah one of the lady's was saying if you go to the doctor then you can't afford to pay your electric bill 'cause you had to pay the doctor 

502.02 504.07 B: oh that's so sad 

503.52 505.12 A: and i mean it's just 

505.65 510.42 A: (( i i i don't understand the united states [laughter] you know [noise] )) 

510.14 523.92 B: i think it's great in a lot of ways but you know when you look at some european countries they have so many they have um state run universities they have state run hospitals they have so many different benefits you know kids go to school for free up until 

519.76 520.71 A: mhm 

523.91 535.00 B: i don't know if it's either college or graduate school and then there's free hospitals you know there's so many things about our country that are great you know like i just said but then there's so many things that are pretty tough 

534.61 543.85 A: [noise] well i think um i think france and sweden i'm not sure if those are the two but i know they supplement your income if you have more kids 

544.17 545.10 B: really 

544.50 546.20 A: um yeah 

545.54 548.36 B: maybe i should move to europe [laughter] 

546.91 556.49 A: [laughter] ah and i mean you get more time off when you have a kid and then [mn] they just give they just automatically send you more money in the mail 

556.76 559.48 A: if you have another child just to help you out 

557.93 561.32 B: you just automatic you have another child and you automatically get more money 

561.23 562.24 A: yeah 

561.77 563.22 B: wow [laughter] 

563.26 570.10 A: i mean i guess it's just the fact that [noise] they know it's hard and if you're you know you may not be making that much money 

570.74 571.70 A: [noise] but like 

571.68 580.72 A: here if you have another kid you're just basically out of luck you're you're just gonna get that minimum wage if you don't if you didn't go to college or whatever [noise] 

577.01 578.15 B: (( that's true )) 

580.58 589.97 A: even people right now even people that went to college are working for like seven bucks an hour because um there have been so many lay offs in the technology fields [mn] 

587.88 588.83 B: true 

589.47 590.62 B: that's true 

591.22 596.16 A: there's just we're i've got a sister who makes like forty five dollars an hour and it's like 

595.83 597.56 B: wow that's good [laughter] 

596.74 599.88 A: (( why are you getting paid all that money )) 

599.34 599.89 B: [laughter]
