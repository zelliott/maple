1.20 2.41 B: hello 

1.26 3.06 A: (( [noise] [mn] hello )) 

2.70 4.14 B: hi i'm joanne 

3.76 5.14 A: hi i'm gina 

4.97 6.81 B: i'm from iowa where are you from 

6.26 8.05 A: [noise] i'm from new jersey 

7.59 8.68 B: okay 

8.73 16.87 A: ah [mn] um we're supposed to talk about the minimum wage increase to five dollars [laughter] which is ridiculous but 

13.87 15.00 B: right 

16.65 21.63 B: [laughter] okay you go ahead first and tell me why you think it's ridiculous and i'll give you my opinion [laughter] 

20.79 25.48 A: [noise] um for well new jersey is a high income state 

25.53 28.16 A: [noise] it's very expensive state to live in 

28.26 36.13 A: and five dollars an hour just really [noise] is like living below poverty level it should be a lot higher 

36.38 41.80 A: so i i just think it's it's not enough to live on it's not eve- it's not enough for gas money 

41.61 44.12 B: [mn] right i agree um if you're going to 

42.71 44.27 A: (( you know yeah )) 

44.14 50.39 B: especially if you have to pay any kind of childcare or you know any kind of ah parking or any other expenses at all 

50.43 53.75 B: um it's really hard to to be able to do it on that 

53.18 55.11 A: (( right [noise] right [noise] )) 

54.06 67.33 B: um you know i also realize that as you increase the minimum wage that makes everything else go up too i mean all the other expenses tend to go up because um when they have to pay their employees more then they have to charge more for all their things so 

67.37 70.68 B: um you know i guess i'm not sure what the answer is but 

70.29 71.47 A: [laughter] 

70.86 74.68 B: um [laughter] i just know when you're buying the things it's very expensive 

74.44 75.48 A: (( [noise] right )) 

75.74 76.98 B: so um 

78.29 84.55 A: [noise] um [laughter] i don't know what else to say we got ten minutes to do this [laughter] 

81.91 89.44 B: i know [laughter] i realize when you're paying teenagers that definitely is you know a difference too you know that 

88.46 96.15 A: right [noise] five dollars an hour for a teenager is is different [noise] because most of the time it's just spending money anyway 

92.61 93.69 B: right 

95.68 110.49 B: i know i wish there was some way to make it that um you know maybe they didn't have to pay them quite as much as you know to make a as they do you know um adults that are are um you know taking care of the family and stuff like that i'm not sure 

109.34 110.58 A: yeah 

110.61 120.29 B: um what the answer is to that and and yet at the same time if they're doing the same job i know it's you know hard not to pay them the same amount it means to say 

118.93 121.12 A: right because then they would 

121.33 123.81 A: it would be age discrimination 

123.04 124.04 B: right 

124.13 126.26 A: and so on and so forth 

124.30 125.51 B: exactly 

126.28 127.58 B: exactly 

126.40 127.34 A: (( right )) 

127.79 130.73 B: um but um how old are you 

130.51 133.72 A: i'm thirty three [laughter] 

131.83 133.81 B: okay i'm forty five i just 

133.64 138.61 B: i remember when i started working when i was sixteen i was getting a dollar sixty an hour you know [laughter] i'm thinking 

137.62 141.68 A: oh wow [laughter] 

138.44 142.97 B: [laughter] you know that was a a long time ago [laughter] 

141.72 144.08 A: yeah [laughter] 

142.88 154.15 B: times have changed since then and you know my my kids can't believe that 'cause now you get more than that babysitting you know i used to babysit for fifty cents an hour [laughter] and ah so that's 

144.66 146.41 A: [mn] oh 

148.76 150.34 A: yeah 

150.70 154.30 A: [laughter] wow yeah 

154.35 156.59 B: [mn] seems like that's not much i know 

154.42 155.48 A: yeah 

156.82 164.90 A: i know it it's it's just i i don't know i don't know what to think of it um [noise] i've never actually worked for minimum wage [noise] 

165.12 166.29 A: um 

167.04 170.98 A: [mn] so i i i b- i can imagine because 

171.26 176.30 A: now i make fifteen dollars an hour and and i'm struggling 

173.92 174.97 B: wow 

175.94 176.84 B: (( ahah )) 

176.31 178.43 A: (( [laughter] you know ))

178.66 182.20 A: i'm i'm a um quality management coordinator 

181.74 182.87 B: (( oh okay )) 

181.98 193.86 A: [noise] i i basically sit in a office and review company policy and see if the employees are following it and revise the policy to work better in the company you know 

192.48 193.49 B: uh-huh 

193.77 205.03 A: so [mn] i sit in front of a computer all half the day and hang out with the employees the other half of the day [laughter] so yeah [noise] um two years now 

196.74 197.84 B: uh-huh 

199.29 200.55 B: [laughter] 

200.85 203.63 B: oh so how long have you been doing that 

204.64 205.71 B: okay 

205.02 209.23 A: [noise] yeah [noise] before that i was um a state corrections officer 

209.04 209.99 B: (( ooh )) 

209.61 219.20 A: which is is not um [noise] if if you're a people person it's not a good job [noise] because you can't socialize at all 

215.78 216.78 B: uh-huh 

218.85 220.32 B: oh yeah i'm sure 

219.59 223.44 A: you know so i- it wasn't the thing for me 

221.03 222.17 B: i'm sure 

223.44 224.37 B: right 

223.86 224.85 A: (( [noise] um )) 

224.57 229.73 B: so they probably couldn't pay you enough to do that [laughter] i mean you know you have to that would be a hard 

226.82 237.08 A: [noise] yeah yeah well i i took a drastic cut in pay to to do what i'm doing now but i'm a lot happier and it's a lot less stress [noise] 

232.04 232.97 B: uh-huh 

234.84 235.87 B: oh good 

236.62 238.23 B: well that's worth a lot 

237.11 243.38 A: so it was it was really worth it to me but like i said i i can't imagine 

239.78 240.78 B: uh-huh 

243.57 247.88 A: [noise] working for one third of what i make now you know 

247.49 248.45 B: uh-huh 

248.10 260.47 A: it it would [mn] it would blow my mind [laughter] [noise] you know it would blow my mind because every everything is like housing is ridiculously expensive [noise] you know um [lipsmack] 

251.14 252.01 B: right 

253.03 253.96 B: right 

260.95 264.64 A: every- everything is expensive gas is al- is is 

265.04 267.05 A: [noise] what how much a gallon 

267.07 277.00 A: a a dollar fifty a gallon [noise] you know [noise] so i i don't know five dollars an hour just doesn't buy you much [laughter] you know so 

268.98 270.02 B: uh-huh 

274.71 275.95 B: that's right 

276.35 277.76 B: that's right 

277.57 278.44 A: (( [noise] [noise] so )) 

278.12 279.60 B: um boy it's 

279.88 282.73 A: [noise] yeah so what do you do for a living 

280.39 281.51 B: yeah 

282.33 285.58 B: um i'm a a secretary at a l- our local church 

285.06 286.60 A: (( [noise] [noise] oh okay )) 

285.72 289.87 B: and um so i've been doing that for um about eleven years now 

289.50 290.54 A: oh wow 

290.10 298.32 B: and ah so i ah i'm up to nine dollars an hour i started at six and i'm up to nine um you know so um 

295.50 296.82 A: [noise] oh that's good 

298.38 299.41 B: but 

299.54 301.11 B: um you know for 

301.19 311.87 B: the town i live in um that's probably pretty close i mean there's pr- i'm sure there's some um secretaries that are making more than [noise] that but um you know that's pretty close to what probably most of them are making 

306.36 310.55 A: (( yeah )) 

311.48 313.34 A: right right 

312.20 314.22 B: and um so i'm 

314.33 315.99 B: you know i think that's pretty close 

316.31 317.83 A: yeah 

316.34 320.26 B: but um yeah so it would 

320.58 324.10 B: yeah i just i'm not sure how um anyone that 

324.22 326.28 B: is the the um 

326.31 331.12 B: main you know breadwinner for the family could make it on you know five i'm just right 

328.95 333.35 A: [lipsmack] yeah i i i see a lot of ads 

333.36 339.57 A: you know i i look at the classifieds all the time and i'm always online looking at what jobs are out there and what jobs are available 

339.57 349.29 A: um [lipsmack] and even in target and you know places like target and walmart and all the disc- discount stores i don't see anyone advertising for 

349.26 358.69 A: you know the minimum wage for five dollars an hour i think i think it's there it may probably be just a number because everyone realizes 

351.80 353.14 B: right 

358.84 361.90 A: that you know it's not realistic 

361.54 362.68 B: right 

361.96 363.55 A: (( you know so )) 

363.70 370.25 A: [mn] unless you're working on like some type of astronomical commission you know 

369.89 371.14 B: yeah 

370.69 378.33 A: s- a- and then maybe like if you're making like a fifty percent commission on every sale that you make 'cause you're a salesperson or something 

377.74 388.15 B: right but most if they do that they're really not tied to minimum wage i don't think i mean 'cause like when you waitress i know you aren't don't have to pay minimum wage because they're getting their tips and so 

378.59 380.28 A: and 

381.62 384.11 A: right yeah no they're not 

388.16 391.03 B: um you don't have to give them minimum wage for that 

389.35 390.73 A: oh okay 

390.79 391.94 A: okay 

391.79 401.46 B: and ah or at least they didn't used to i don't know unless that has changed but um it used to be that they could do quite a bit below minimum wage because you know they assumed that you would make that up on tips 

401.39 402.77 A: right 

402.49 403.64 B: and ah so 

405.89 414.83 B: [mn] yeah this could be a long ten minutes [laughter] i didn't [laughter] i didn't look at the clock when we started [laughter] 

408.39 412.83 A: [laughter] i know [laughter] 

413.73 418.55 A: [laughter] i didn't either it's supposed to beep when we get to ten minutes 

418.12 420.89 B: ri- well yeah i have you is this the first one you've done 

420.49 421.53 A: yes 

421.13 428.20 B: yeah i had done one before and i think at at ah nine minutes it told us we had a minute left and and ah to to tell us to 

425.82 427.21 A: (( oh okay )) 

428.48 432.75 A: yeah i kept missing the call so tonight i just called them myself 

432.24 433.22 B: right 

432.66 443.92 A: 'cause i if i wait for it they call like ten minutes to ten and i'm half asleep and i don't answer the phone [laughter] so i just figured i'd call before i get really tired you know so 

438.37 439.41 B: (( ahah )) 

442.31 443.29 B: (( ahah )) 

443.95 456.60 B: so well i know i had done one a couple of weeks ago and then i hadn't gotten any more and i just saw that it said you can call in yourself so i thought um i would go ahead and do that and and ah get going so [sigh] um 

449.23 451.34 A: yeah 

452.42 453.57 A: yeah 

456.63 460.01 B: actually this question's easier than the one i had last time so [laughter] 

458.97 461.15 A: (( oh wha- what did you have before )) 

460.78 467.22 B: before it was would you rather if you could give up ah your best friend for a million dollars would you do it 

466.77 468.08 A: oh wow 

467.56 473.74 B: and ah you know that one was kinda like no and that was the end of it [laughter] you know i didn't really have a lot to say on that one 

470.67 477.41 A: yeah [laughter] like what do you talk about [laughter] wow 

474.33 478.87 B: [laughter] right [laughter] but um [lipsmack] anyway
