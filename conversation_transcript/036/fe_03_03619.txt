48.19 50.75 B: forty years so to speak

102.89 107.94 A: amazing it's absolutely it's kind of a shame the both of us agree but i don't really know a lot of people who um

131.80 134.62 B: (( uh uh uh been signed or )) 

133.82 135.18 A: i it's 

135.90 138.24 A: i actually thought it would i well 

137.77 139.26 B: part of the budget 

138.48 143.99 A: from what i from what i understand it it is but um that's the national wage 

143.65 144.91 B: (( r- right )) 

144.04 148.46 A: national minimum wage and then the states can go a little bit higher but none of 'em usually do 

147.83 149.85 B: well i know california doesn't 

150.43 154.34 A: um i don't think um don't think virginia d._c. does either 

153.96 154.85 B: uh-huh 

155.12 158.89 B: how does that work in the d._c. it goes by the national l- uh law right 

158.88 160.52 A: (( no i think that's their local )) 

160.29 162.84 B: oh they can pass their own law as well oh that's interesting 

161.55 162.59 A: yeah 

163.20 164.19 B: (( um )) 

164.30 169.62 B: but d- [laughter] this is off the subject but y- you guys get to vote in national elections didn't ya 

169.29 170.28 A: yeah 

169.93 172.22 B: at one point you didn't isn't that correct 

172.15 173.56 A: um 

172.34 174.34 B: w- one point in history 

174.26 182.54 A: i actually don't know i actually i live right outside of d._c. i live about a five minute walk to the d._c. borders so i would say that i'm in dc it's just easier that way 

182.20 187.78 B: uh-huh what's the public uh opinion about the the minimum wage there 

187.39 197.09 A: oh nobody nobody agrees with it i mean even the fat cat politicians nobody really i mean nobody in their right mind really agrees with it it's just it's just money you know i- 

196.26 199.13 B: yeah how much of an increase is it do you know 

197.35 198.08 A: (( i- )) 

198.93 201.11 A: (( [sigh] uh i think it's thirty five cents )) 

201.03 202.72 B: wow yeah that's nothing 

202.90 204.16 A: no it's not 

203.08 208.64 B: i thought it was up ar- i thought it was aro- i'm out of touch on this issue 'cause i thought it was around seven dollars already 

208.66 216.56 A: yeah no i i i am too i'm i can't imagine having a job that'll pay minimum wage there's no way that i could l- live 

216.67 219.66 A: anywhere near the standard of living i'm at right now 

219.97 224.92 B: no i- what's that forty so that's two hundred bucks a week you'll be working forty hours 

223.60 224.54 A: yeah 

225.14 226.38 A: that's nothing 

225.36 226.30 B: (( so )) 

226.41 231.94 B: see i thought it was much more than that because uh i know some college kids who work for the summer um 

231.96 236.83 B: they get jobs working construction just as laborer but they're starting out at twenty dollars an hour 

236.45 237.27 A: yeah 

237.41 239.46 B: i mean that's a nice wage 

238.85 249.46 A: it's just the caliber of jobs that that people do who make minimum wage they're working fast food they're they're clean- well actually no cleaning service makes more than minimum wage 

244.82 245.82 B: yeah 

248.95 252.88 B: yeah cleaning are most like independent contractors i think around here 

251.99 264.22 A: yeah i i definitely think it's down to like it's like little mom and pop shop that can't afford to pay their workers any more and in fact who who definitely can but they feel like they're unskilled labor so mhm 

256.42 257.31 B: uh-huh 

258.87 260.10 B: yeah 

264.14 270.51 B: perhap- some of these sales people they make commission plus uh hourly minimum wage i think too i don't know 

269.60 270.40 A: but 

270.42 272.05 A: definitely a lot more 

271.73 272.67 B: yeah 

273.22 274.36 B: so uh 

274.41 275.89 B: (( [sigh] do you )) 

275.15 278.88 A: i mean i i actually knew the topic ahead of time um [laughter] 

278.31 279.81 B: i didn't 

279.17 284.85 A: by accident i called in earlier this morning trying to get on while i was at work and um 

285.39 289.80 A: and i i didn't really give it much thought at the time but i [sigh] 

290.00 293.09 B: uh they do they keep the same topic for the whole day 

290.23 291.21 A: you know the 

292.81 294.13 A: whole day yeah 

293.71 295.46 B: oh this is my first call 

295.14 297.12 A: mine is too um 

296.21 297.36 B: (( oh okay )) 

297.44 298.93 A: (( [noise] the uh )) 

299.00 302.02 B: must be getting close to ten minutes don't you think [laughter] okay 

301.26 307.66 A: no actually i don't think it is it's well yeah we're about five minutes into it [noise] um 

303.11 303.86 B: (( okay )) 

307.74 309.39 B: i can keep going with you 

307.77 309.32 A: (( i forgot what i was gonna say )) 

309.52 310.60 A: i'm sorry 

310.18 311.62 B: i can keep going 

311.47 313.83 A: yeah no i forgot what i was going to say go ahead 

313.41 317.42 B: i was gonna ask you if you knew anybody personally who uh makes minimum wage 

316.85 318.00 A: no i don't 

319.40 321.03 B: uh i don't either 

320.72 323.58 A: and i don't know when the last time i made minimum wage was 

323.17 326.81 B: yeah it's a long time ago like i said forty years ago 

326.30 328.51 A: actually you know i don't even think i ever did 

328.27 329.10 B: uh-huh 

329.71 340.62 A: um oh this is what i was gonna say that that okay so you have this you have this family who who both their parents are making minimum both that you have both parents are making minimum wage they have a couple of kids 

340.79 341.65 B: uh-huh 

340.94 342.64 A: how're they gonna make ends meet 

342.51 343.71 B: yeah 

343.06 351.78 A: you know nine times out of ten they're gonna either live in a hole and try to do it legitimately or they're gonna you know the one time or two times at a time they're gonna do something illegal 

351.89 359.37 B: i think out here in excuse me i think out here in san francisco the the the the welfare is more than that almost 

352.01 353.51 A: and 

359.27 360.09 A: the what 

359.80 363.18 B: the the you know the welfare from um you know 

363.20 364.72 B: families on a 

365.59 373.60 B: welfare uh in san francisco there's the highest rate in the country and i think it's it's probably equivalent if not more than the minimum wage almost 

373.63 374.83 B: it's like uh 

374.00 375.04 A: (( i- yeah )) 

375.33 381.99 A: welfare well also the supplemental program is is really good but i think that that welfare program's really screwed 

375.37 376.31 B: yeah 

381.71 393.22 B: yeah yeah i mean that's 'cause and there'd be no incentive to get off welfare with that kinda minimum wage that's what i'm trying to say um 'cause i just it's about three hundred and eighty five dollars every two weeks here per person 

393.37 397.54 B: for the husband and the wife if they're both you know qualify for welfare 

397.79 404.87 B: and like if they're new immigrants who don't have jobs yet uh that's what they come into san francisco and that's what they get which is real close to 

405.05 409.38 B: uh forty hours at five dollars an hour s- you know 

409.41 416.43 B: two hundred what's that two hundred dollars a week four hundred dollars every two weeks so you're talking about a fifteen twenty dollar difference between that an welfare 

411.23 411.93 A: (( we- )) 

416.85 420.90 B: so there really is no incentive to go get a job for minimum wage 

420.06 424.01 A: no there isn't i um in fact that like my parents um 

424.19 427.72 A: back a few years ago had a family friend who 

428.00 429.06 A: um 

429.82 435.77 A: who he was unemployed because of disability and they ended up having to go on welfare the family did 

435.50 436.40 B: uh-huh 

435.91 437.48 A: and he 

437.51 441.15 A: after he recovered from disability he didn't go back to work because he was 

441.63 446.66 A: he was he got to do what he wanted to do during the day and he was getting a check anyway 

446.52 451.65 B: oh yeah that's that's uh that's big time that can be big time money there but 

451.00 452.58 A: exploitation of welfare 

452.31 458.33 B: yeah yeah that's social security right i think you're talking about social security 

453.28 455.00 A: (( 'cause there was no checks and balances )) 

455.55 456.49 A: i'm sorry 

457.53 467.49 A: no he was he was on welfare and i i he they they the family ended up going on welfare um neither i think the wife had like a a low paying job but not a minimum wage job 

464.91 466.18 B: yeah 

467.31 471.93 B: uh-huh yeah that's uh definitely the case i know some people on uh 

472.15 482.08 B: disability uh part of it part of the funds come from social security disability part of it comes from the state welfare fund and they're like you know picking up over a thousand dollars a month 

482.52 485.80 B: and uh working under the table and everything else [laughter] 

485.36 486.18 A: yeah 

486.24 488.52 B: (( yeah so i don't know )) 

487.59 491.36 A: well you opened up an interesting can of worms what about the uh immigrants who come 

491.39 492.97 A: from other countries 

492.35 501.54 B: yeah that just uh smacked me right in the face i said trying to think about you know situations in california got all those farm workers that just come over from new mexico and central america 

501.63 507.18 B: and i mean they don't get any more mi- than minimum wage and those people really work their tails off 

507.39 508.42 B: um 

507.98 510.41 A: but that's another that's another question though should they 

510.79 512.76 B: should they be here or should they 

512.00 519.65 A: if they get the money should they get should we get money that that they're not contributing they're not contributing to the fund so why should they get the money 

520.18 521.30 B: uh 

520.82 523.52 A: the question more of a than my opinion but 

523.35 526.48 B: no the answer to the bottom line is no but uh 

526.51 540.58 B: i think it's going after the the owners of the you know the farms and the that re putting them to work in the vineyards and whatever that are putting them to work those are the people who are you know i think are preying on the system 

538.11 540.02 A: (( who should be like )) 

541.00 542.09 B: i mean uh 

541.16 543.09 A: (( there's no way to there's no way to clean that up )) 

542.87 546.74 B: you can't pi- you can't blame people for trying to get out of poverty you know they're 

546.77 548.59 B: i don't think so either 

548.77 552.33 B: you know mexico's even worse than what they're living here 

553.22 554.87 A: we're nearing our ten minutes 

554.78 556.84 B: okay how do you know that 

556.58 558.41 A: i have uh i'm on my mobile phone 

558.08 561.76 B: okay [laughter] what will they notify us or 

559.29 560.72 A: [laughter] 

561.35 568.13 A: they'll notify us when they're when they're ready um when the ten minutes is officially up but i just wanted to le- give you like 

563.33 564.36 B: okay 

566.88 568.63 B: but what do we do about uh 

568.77 575.41 B: um venting out feelings about this do we write our congressmen is that a or it's too late 

573.11 573.93 A: well 

575.30 577.02 A: for the minimum wage 

576.51 577.87 B: yeah 

577.43 581.87 A: there's always going to be another hike up it's an ongoing process 

579.31 580.59 B: (( mm i- )) 

581.56 583.13 B: is it tied to the budget 

583.28 584.50 A: i'm sure it is 

584.42 585.54 B: yeah okay 

584.85 586.12 A: i'm sure it is 

586.43 587.29 B: (( uh )) 

586.76 588.02 A: um th- th- 

588.78 599.95 A: well it it shouldn't well welfare yeah but minimum wage i think is more of a an opinion and i don't think that the people on the hill are are fully aware fully aware of uh of problem i'm sure they know 

593.41 594.31 B: (( mm ))
