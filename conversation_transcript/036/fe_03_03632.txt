0.61 2.68 B: hello my name is angela 

2.39 4.28 A: hi this is julie 

4.77 6.97 B: hi julie um 

7.24 12.82 B: my opinion on the minimum wage i think it's at too low i think people need to 

12.91 13.99 B: um 

14.38 15.91 B: i guess ah 

16.71 21.38 B: make a little bit more money especially with the economy the way it's going right now what do you think 

21.56 22.98 A: well 

23.30 31.96 A: i don't know at first blush i disagree um and that maybe just because i haven't had to work in a minimum wage job for a long time 

32.17 38.23 A: um but i think that when you start to examine other factors 

38.45 39.47 A: um 

40.12 49.40 A: you know like the fact that if somebody is making minimum wage they're more likely to need maybe governmental support or um 

50.08 53.80 A: even help in the form of something like food stamps or something 

53.82 58.18 A: that's probably going to raise taxes and maybe then 

58.25 60.34 A: yeah it needs to be higher 

61.36 63.13 A: what do you do for a living 

61.40 63.14 B: right 

63.45 67.18 B: um i ah i worked as a a 

67.28 69.98 B: telemarketer and salesperson 

70.05 74.41 B: and i've been doing it off and on for years i'm a single parent so 

74.45 79.36 B: yeah i can i don't work for minimum wage but i know other people that do 

79.45 87.45 B: and it's just tough i and i mean even if i don't work minimum wage there are times i still struggle so i can see a 

87.49 90.79 B: someone else struggling big time and it really bothers me 

91.05 92.56 B: that you know 

92.69 96.32 B: it hasn't been raised that much in quite a while 

97.53 103.91 A: well and you know i guess too when i think about of the companies that have minimum wage 

104.32 109.24 A: um employees i guess i do look at as being exploitive 

109.33 114.03 A: um you know they're making decent money i don't care what they say 

114.74 118.23 A: and then they're turning around and paying their employees 

118.54 120.10 A: essentially nothing 

121.85 123.03 B: that's true 

123.25 126.53 B: i've seen that myself um 

126.80 134.81 B: i've also seen where there's people getting paid way more for doing very little and the ones that do a whole lot are getting paid less 

135.45 138.13 B: i don't know if you've experienced that 

137.50 138.83 A: well um 

138.87 147.05 A: we actually had a meeting at work today and they told us that we were getting two percent raises and in the same meeting 

146.97 159.59 A: asked for money for a political action committee and when they told got them telling us that we were getting two percent raises told us that um the top thirteen paid people in the company were getting 

159.87 162.44 A: million dollar bonuses 

163.20 165.54 B: oh wow [laughter] 

164.81 165.77 A: yeah 

165.60 167.93 B: so and so well that's not fair 

168.11 171.15 A: no well i mean like you said we're doing the 

171.22 174.39 B: yeah mhm 

171.38 173.40 A: essentially the grunt work 

173.62 174.94 A: and um 

175.00 177.59 A: and the top thirteen paid people are getting 

177.77 184.82 A: more in their bonus than they needed to collect from the entire company and that for the 

179.57 181.69 B: (( yeah )) 

183.52 184.72 B: that's true 

184.84 188.05 A: you know tax committee that they wanted our money for 

187.96 191.92 B: mm th- that's true what do you do for a living 

191.77 196.95 A: i'm a legal assistance for um the biggest bank in the country 

196.97 198.01 B: oh wow 

198.88 203.21 B: that's a good job [laughter] but then again i'm sure it's very tough 

200.01 201.70 A: (( well well )) 

202.74 211.09 A: yeah a- and you know it's long hours and it's stressful and it's answering to a corporate boss and um you know so like i said i 

208.81 209.58 B: (( mm )) 

211.08 221.44 A: i in some ways i i don't have a whole lot of sympathy for people who do work at minimum wage jobs 'cause i think to myself well you know gosh i put myself through school as an adult with small kids 

221.63 222.35 B: mm 

221.67 225.93 A: go get a you know go get a degree and make something of yourself but 

226.41 227.60 A: i guess they're 

226.54 231.97 B: yeah but at the same time it's not that easy to go to school and get a degree either 

232.03 243.94 A: no it definitely wasn't easy like i said i did it when my kids were three and two years' old and it was not easy at all um i was lucky enough to be able to find a program that 

232.23 233.23 B: um 

243.98 244.98 A: um 

245.09 246.04 A: you know 

246.31 248.83 A: ah subsidized my education 

249.05 249.98 A: um 

249.13 250.48 B: oh that's awesome 

250.46 252.63 A: you know they not only paid for 

252.93 260.85 A: my tuition but they also paid for books and daycare and gave me a little bit of gas money to get back and forth to school so 

261.18 262.04 A: um 

262.31 263.43 A: i suppose 

262.41 263.68 B: yeah see 

263.46 267.91 A: i should maybe keep that in mind too when i'm being so harsh that 

267.26 268.29 B: (( that's true )) 

267.92 269.19 A: you know that was 

268.40 278.92 B: because there there are people out there that are trying the best that they can and still you know have to find these minimum wage jobs that's all they can do 

278.84 287.61 A: well and but you know on the other hand too my husband you know he has worked minimum wage jobs but he's worked two at a time when he had to 

279.18 280.23 B: um 

288.34 289.22 B: (( uh-huh )) 

288.97 291.11 A: so you know i mean 

291.49 298.72 B: well it it depends upon the person too i'm i'm looking from a a single parent's point of view too 

299.09 302.15 B: you your you have a husband i don't 

299.13 300.06 A: right 

301.51 302.53 A: right 

302.24 316.67 B: so i i in the the area i live in um i i live around a lot of people that work minimum wage jobs because where i live that's all i can afford to to live you know that's all i can afford to pay 

316.38 317.42 A: right 

316.85 324.41 B: and um i mean i'm like i said i'm not at minimum wage but then again i'm you know 

325.16 330.49 B: not that far um i'm i'm a couple of dollars away from minimum wage but still 

330.52 331.90 B: the thing is 

332.38 337.26 B: there are people out there that are trying their best to get somewhere in life 

337.34 338.77 B: and 

338.81 343.24 B: they're not [mn] a- getting the breaks that they you know they 

343.44 346.43 B: deserve sometimes especially 

344.98 351.81 A: right but you know and i mean another thing that i think a lot of people don't um don't um 

352.16 356.85 A: account for when they say that the minimum wage should be raised is that i mean 

356.95 366.26 A: if for instance mcdonalds has to start paying their employees a dollar an hour more they're not going to take that hit they're going to pass that along to the consumer 

366.38 370.83 A: and pretty soon nobody's going to be able to afford to even go eat at mcdonalds 

370.70 372.05 B: mhm 

371.38 374.68 A: you know and it's just going to have that ripple effect 

374.94 377.01 A: it's going to drive inflation 

378.69 381.96 B: y- yes and i don't really think th- that much 

382.13 383.04 B: (( ah )) 

383.18 394.62 B: 'cause there are people out there that um like you said the people in your in your job that you know are getting million dollar bonuses um 

394.66 399.60 B: there are so many people out there that are able to help someone that's in need 

400.02 410.13 B: and don't and then there's people out there that are earning this minimum wage and if you needed to borrow a quarter from them they're more than happy to give it 

409.48 411.41 A: yeah you're absolutely right 

412.12 413.83 A: you're absolutely right 

412.18 421.62 B: and i mean i'm one i'm one of those people so you know i don't earn that much but if someone needs something i'm one of the first ones there to help them 

421.73 429.12 B: and then i there's other people in my company that make more money and it's like ah 

429.18 439.71 B: well you know ah you owe me it it they go and buy lunch for a bunch of people ah don't forget that's a dollar and twenty five cents you know 

439.27 440.26 A: right 

439.58 447.65 B: in- instead of not worrying about that extra quarter that's why you know if i was to ever which i don't hardly ever 

447.49 460.77 B: eat out um i make sure i give down to i even figure into the taxes so i know that i'm paying my share plus i give a little bit gratuity too for the person that's going to get the food or whatever 

460.74 468.54 B: because i know how hard it is and ah the people it seems a lot and and i'm not saying you or 

468.36 476.92 B: ah anyone you know that you know but there are people out there that are making a lot ah you know the good money they don't see 

477.96 483.14 A: well i i think that probably what my colleagues see i think is probably 

478.14 479.39 B: the the 

483.28 495.54 A: what i expressed even maybe on a more grander scale that you know hey i put my own self through college i've busted my butt to get where i am you can do the same thing 

496.43 499.38 B: yeah but it's always not that easy um 

498.30 510.37 A: no i'm i'm not saying it is i think that people are you know a lot of times that are in those positions are born with silver spoons in their mouths they don't know what it is to you know work a day's wage 

509.02 509.79 B: true 

510.89 511.89 A: they 

511.13 513.74 B: that's true yeah i understand where you're coming from there 

513.33 525.13 A: you know they went they got out of high school they their mom and dad put 'em through college they got a good job right out of college and they've never had to drive a cab or wait a table or you know 

513.88 514.51 B: (( they'd )) 

525.76 526.58 B: yeah 

527.06 528.59 A: the dirty jobs 

527.27 528.43 B: yeah i underst- 

528.62 537.59 B: yeah i understand what you're saying but i mean i don't know it's it's kind of hard i don't know what part of town you're or what area of the country you're calling from 

536.95 538.40 A: i'm in florida 

538.41 550.55 B: oh okay i'm on the other side of it i'm on the west side i'm in arizona and and i i was in a store the other day and i heard this woman say why are things so expensive here 

542.93 543.92 A: (( oh wow )) 

550.61 557.25 B: and i'm not sure exactly i think she said she was from the east coast ah north north east the thing this 

555.62 556.73 A: uh-huh 

557.27 562.99 B: i've heard that arizona's not as expensive as a lot of other places and um 

563.38 573.76 B: there are people that are still struggling even though they do their best to educate themselves and and try to get somewhere in life 

573.77 575.21 B: and 

575.20 585.71 B: that a- you know if they were able to make a little bit more money maybe they would be able to afford to do different things to be able to to go to school or wh- whatever 

585.69 591.45 B: um like i said i'm a single parent i can't um i mean 

591.48 599.89 B: i'd have to go and get the the loans the student loans and a lot of the times i don't even qualify for certain things
