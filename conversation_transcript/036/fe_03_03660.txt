0.14 2.34 B: (( hello my name is renato )) 

1.95 6.15 A: [noise] hello this is mike in oakland california where are you 

2.37 3.75 B: i'm calling 

5.98 7.58 B: uh san francisco 

7.40 9.05 A: [noise] okay 

9.36 13.84 B: so not too far yes um so what do you think of minimum wages 

13.62 26.19 A: [noise] well i'm generally uh for them um i know in san francisco and uh some other bay area cities their so called living wages which are higher than minimum wages so the um 

26.21 34.81 A: you know question is slightly irrelevant [noise] hello [noise] i'm sorry i heard kind of a squeak i thought we'd gotten cut off 

30.14 31.29 B: hello yes 

34.64 36.25 B: (( yeah i heard the same )) 

34.89 49.02 A: but [noise] but uh san francisco i believe has a eight or nine living wage um on the books with i think eleven proposed i may be wrong on that what do you think [noise] 

48.11 59.04 B: well i think um minimum wages uh um look too low for the standards of um living in today's world i think minimum wages um keep us barely at a minimum 

58.84 68.90 B: uh droning level of sustainability without really any potential to like grow i think you know in a real economy where humanity is um 

68.96 78.53 B: is worthy or does like deserve um the wages would be um valued at how 

78.72 80.34 B: expensive um 

80.55 85.76 B: the necessities are if you understand what i mean by that 

84.93 99.20 A: how would you um respond to the argument that uh by raising minimum wages uh too much it's going to raise the cost of uh doing business so we're generally going to be uh paying more for everything 

99.12 102.87 B: well that's an interesting interesting comment um i think that um 

103.11 115.89 B: uh as a socialist i believe that um basic necessities um should be basically implemented free of charge by the government to all people and looking at looking at through a court 

108.15 109.34 A: (( [noise] )) 

114.58 121.72 A: how would you define not to get too off i apologize how would you define basic necessities [noise] mm 

121.11 124.81 B: well i think we all need shelter and we need basic foods 

124.71 137.90 B: and i think there're certain groups of food that we can all we all need um such as milk rice beans meat you know and i think we all we're all entitled not to survive but to live in this planet 

132.28 133.58 A: (( [noise] )) 

137.93 150.82 B: i think that um wages should should like be proportional to those necessities when you're making five some an hour it's really hard for you to really sustain you- yourself and and your family 

150.60 151.16 A: (( [mn] )) 

150.93 155.16 B: with with a bare minimum it's only the bare minimum that you're allowed to you know 

154.60 162.77 A: [noise] well i think there um to gently disagree um as i say i'm with you in principle but uh 

162.75 166.39 A: i think there also has to be some correlation uh 

166.19 172.93 A: with the uh cost of living because in uh san francisco and bay area we have a higher living standard 

172.80 184.72 A: which would could note a higher minimum wage uh but in places like mississippi where it doesn't cost as much to live maybe um we don't necessarily need too much more than the minimum wage 

184.33 194.84 B: no that's i i i agree i agree totally with you on that but with wages at five and a little bit higher in san francisco i think that in itself is 

194.61 205.60 B: a disastrous for a population that wants to grow i i think that as you mention san francisco has a living wages which are usually like eight or nine and higher i think 

203.86 207.38 A: [noise] yes and that's probably what we need and uh 

207.23 221.54 A: there's no question i'm sure you won't argue with me but uh the cost of living is some of the highest in the country round here real estate for both uh homeowners and renters is just atrocious in terms of prices to give you one example 

222.20 223.22 B: correct 

223.56 227.21 A: [noise] and 

227.12 230.13 A: (( uh well [noise] i don't i don't know [noise] )) 

228.26 229.27 B: [laughter] 

229.96 243.01 A: i wonder if we uh hang up before we get the ten minute warning if we've uh uh if we feel um fulfilling what social project wants 'cause uh 

235.58 236.57 B: [laughter] 

242.95 246.30 A: um you know i think we've pretty much covered the area 

243.71 258.30 B: well i think i think we could just we should still use our our rhetorical powers to sustain a ten minute conversation on this topic regardless of our fulfillment just to establish the security of our um income on this call 

258.43 267.17 A: [noise] well that's a good point um how long this is my first call uh involving this or um how long have you uh been with them yourself 

258.59 259.55 B: i'd say 

266.63 270.52 B: oh this is my first call i was actually a little bit surprised they called so soon 

270.30 278.50 A: [noise] i am too i uh only signed up either one or two days ago at the most [noise] uh balance could exist how about you 

274.30 276.16 B: [laughter] corre- 

278.26 281.90 B: yes exactly the same thing and also one or two days ago 

279.52 280.85 A: (( [laughter] oh )) 

281.31 286.90 A: [noise] no i'm i'm clear maybe you can uh give me your wisdom on this 

286.73 301.15 A: as to whether we're supposed to be compensated per call or whether we are just entered in the contest that if we have a whole number of phones [noise] that we're involved with that we get compensated uh what's your feeling on that [noise] 

295.56 296.66 B: [laughter] 

300.47 311.91 B: um i r- i'm generally at a loss with uh the details of this i i think it was an interesting um description of um an experience that they offered you know 

304.41 305.65 A: mm 

310.90 320.18 A: [noise] yeah well i agree um might i ask what's your uh profession uh what do you do and so are you a student or working 

319.52 321.20 B: (( yes i'm a fulltime student )) 

320.89 331.10 A: [noise] oh okay um yeah i'm a part time legal assistant and a uh part time restaurant and food writer i have a couple of small columns [noise] 

330.39 334.96 B: uh how interesting i don't think i ever expect to talk to someone who 

331.97 332.87 A: well 

333.77 335.46 A: [noise] i'm sorry 

335.22 340.86 B: [laughter] i don't think i'd ever expect to have a phone conversation with someone with those um criteria's 

341.08 354.20 A: [noise] well i don't know the law is inevitable maybe inescapable and sometimes unfortunate but uh you know if you're in the san francisco spirit even if you don't have too much money as a uh student 

354.13 361.05 A: uh most people enjoy eating out following restaurants where even neighborhood uh cheaper ones [noise] and 

360.26 361.62 B: of course of course 

361.22 373.50 A: of course uh the restaurants we go to unfortunately um it's the busboys that uh and frequently the waiters that um [lipsmack] you know are stuck with the minimum wage 

372.74 377.97 B: right and the this brings me to uh just a spur of the moment question that i just 

378.23 388.50 B: came about through this d- dialogue but um i see tipping has become almost a request and required and i see that as an answer to the minimum wages 

384.78 385.60 A: (( [noise] )) 

387.96 395.75 A: well that's true because uh the vast majority of the waiters we deal with and waitresses and wait persons uh 

395.80 410.55 A: get the minimum wage and then they offset that uh with tips and unfortunately and this might be a part of the law that we want to change um i understand some restaurants can offset a certain amount of tips against the minimum wage so 

410.36 416.94 A: in terms of their actual wages they're are getting less even though they probably come out in one piece [noise] 

417.74 418.89 B: that's true 

419.14 423.83 B: well w- what you what would you think about um carrying our cash program 

424.11 426.19 A: uh 

426.20 437.97 A: i don't know um well the problem i saw an article i'm sorry i'm in the middle of a phone survey but as soon as i finish i'll get back to cooking um the uh problem is that uh 

437.76 444.00 A: there was an article on uh in today's chronicle um [cough] excuse me 

444.01 453.70 A: th- that said uh you know with care not cash everyone is supposed to be entitled to a place in a shelter but the shelter is already filled so they're flooring 

452.83 454.33 B: mhm 

454.01 460.16 A: [noise] so you know the obviously money [noise] is going to have to be spent to uh implement care not cash 

456.16 456.80 B: wh- 

460.49 465.58 B: but do you think that's a sustainable um resolution for the homeless pr- homeless problem 

464.77 466.72 A: [noise] i don't know it's uh 

466.64 468.39 A: situation i 

468.29 472.53 A: through the course of my life have run into some homeless people and uh 

472.42 479.69 A: the problem is a lot of them if you give 'em money uh they're gonna use it on drugs and they're not gonna use it on [noise] uh 

477.94 479.08 B: that's true mhm 

479.55 481.65 A: on sustaining themselves 

481.47 487.99 A: but on the other hand [noise] um i even though i know as a socialist you're probably more in favor of society 

487.80 499.77 A: doing things for people you know i have a certain reluctance to make a choice for people saying you have to stay here you have to do this and that's what care not cash seems to 

499.81 501.46 A: (( imply )) 

501.16 505.50 B: right right and definitely it's not like a situation it's a 

503.95 505.49 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

507.49 510.21 A: well the ones i some of 'em do 

510.97 514.89 A: i'm sorry [laughter] my room mates uh joining the uh discussion 

514.43 518.37 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] uh ))

525.40 527.74 A: (( [noise] uh )) 

527.88 541.62 A: no i'm uh actually like many people i'm looking for uh ways to increase it i'd certainly like to get more money [noise] well i guess um are you having to hold a job or are your parents helping you out [noise] 

540.94 555.16 B: uh my parents are helping me out a- and i'm a foreign i'm brazilian as a citizen so it makes it a little bit difficult to get um a job with out the authorization from my school so that limits me to like what kind of jobs i can get without breaking the law 

553.47 565.39 A: well i have to uh i have to uh give you a compliment your english is absolutely flawless i'd never uh have guessed in in years that uh portuguese is your first language

572.50 587.33 B: uh well i w- i grew up in europe like england france and switzerland so my first education um was done in english primarily and followed through so i guess english became my first language by default but uh
