0.60 2.87 A: hi this is rick tidwell 

2.01 4.81 B: hi my name is tina holmes 

4.93 6.54 A: how ya doing 

5.69 7.01 B: hi rick 

7.22 11.97 B: um do you feel that uh what is it five fifteen minimum wage suffic- 

10.79 13.53 A: [laughter] yeah i think that's what they said 

13.56 16.06 A: yeah i think it's sufficient 

15.41 16.78 B: why do you think that 

17.35 20.24 A: well i just think that uh a lot of 

20.23 31.59 A: because the job market is so down i think we should do everything we can to get businesses to open up more jobs for people and if you keep pushing the minimum wage 

31.43 37.04 A: higher and higher you're gonna get more um companies resistant to opening new jobs 

37.28 43.42 B: well you might be right um but i just read this book called nickel and dimed um and uh did you read it 

41.29 42.45 A: yeah 

43.58 44.50 A: no 

44.34 52.93 B: oh it was about this woman um she uh was a reporter but she tried to take these minimum wage jobs to you know she kinda went under cover and wrote about it 

52.78 62.63 B: and and it was really really hard for me to live off that money um that she made in the minimum wage and she's saying that most people on these minimum wage jobs 

52.89 53.80 A: yeah 

62.47 72.08 B: um you know they can't afford to live by themselves they have to live with their families they can't afford their own place it's it's really hard to make ends meet 

72.63 81.07 A: well yeah i probably agree with that i probably think that's real difficult for people but i mean i guess i'm thinking along the lines of like uh 

82.03 92.80 A: you know younger uh people entering into the job markets you know where they are living at home or they're living with friends you know where they can get out and get a job and they're unskilled 

85.41 86.45 B: yeah 

88.97 90.86 B: yeah well that's different 

92.21 96.50 B: right yeah well she was a middle aged woman when she did this yeah 

94.70 96.28 A: that's different 

96.62 104.29 B: um and she just did it as an experiment but a lot of her coworkers were here age and they were really struggling some of them were 

103.62 105.11 A: oh yeah 

104.33 107.95 B: living in their cars and [laughter] it was bad you know 

107.25 111.78 A: yeah yeah i know i think that's i think it's real tough and i think 

112.11 117.67 A: one of the other things that discourages i think a whole uh unemployment situation is 

117.75 130.59 A: um the fact that you know there's a a we almost reward people for not having jobs not necessarily for minimum wage but like a lot of people won't go to work for minimum wage because 

130.57 134.12 A: uh they can make more money with unemployment so 

133.43 136.22 B: right well that's just a temporary solution though 

135.72 148.67 A: right it is but they'll go they'll go job to job and get in it and then they don't care if they lose that job because of the performance you know they'll just go back out on on uh unemployment 

148.13 152.10 B: but if they if they're fired from their job can they collect unemployment 

151.77 157.52 A: uh i don't i think if you're fired i'm not sure if you can or not uh i think no 

155.29 158.07 B: i don't think you can i think you have to be laid off 

158.22 160.70 A: right laid off or um 

160.80 163.56 A: something happens yeah right 

162.86 165.26 B: yeah yeah lack of work 

164.36 164.92 A: (( [cough] )) 

164.94 166.38 A: mhm 

165.70 167.63 B: yeah well i don't i don't 

166.81 171.12 A: it's a tough it's a tough situation out there for people i mean 

169.98 171.53 B: are you employed now 

171.49 172.76 A: yeah 

171.94 178.15 B: yeah um i i know it's very tough i mean i i kind of can see both points 

178.08 190.39 B: you know i mean after reading that book and um you know hearing the stories of the people she encountered who were trying to live on minimum wage salaries i really felt for them and i'd never really thought about it before 

178.15 179.31 A: yeah 

190.19 198.10 B: because i've never had to do that but then on the other hand you know like you say if it's some young kid just starting out that they have their family 

196.78 202.41 A: o- or a retired person that's on a fixed income and are just trying to make a little extra money you know 

202.09 203.13 B: mhm 

202.44 210.90 A: and they don't necessarily need a you know a ten twenty dollar an hour job they just need something to give 'em a little extra spending cash and they 

210.98 218.96 A: and a lot of people that li- that are in that age range they can't afford to make too much or they'll lose their uh you know um 

219.35 222.23 A: monies of the social security or whatever it is coming in 

222.29 235.64 B: well i i in a way i think of those people as maybe exceptions i i mean i don't know like percentage wise how many people um on minimum wage are either elderly or you know just some young kids starting out 

235.20 238.23 A: yeah i i don't know the percentages of it either 

237.89 251.83 B: but they were talking about you know people with kids and oh this woman you know she had to go to all these fleabag motels and try to get rooms and she couldn't cook there and then she had to eat this really awful food out of tin [laughter] cans it was 

246.21 247.30 A: mhm 

251.33 255.02 A: but but i'm wondering if that really is more of the exce- exception 

255.07 256.48 B: (( i don't know )) 

255.99 258.32 A: you know i just i don't know the percentages i mean 

258.62 269.54 A: um i know there's a lot of people that are out of work for a lot of different reasons but you know when you go outside the united states and you see how other countries are handling it like in mexico or somewhere else 

269.70 281.14 A: of course they are paying a minimum wage or and even a lot less than what we are and and and they do have to live you know multiple people to a dwelling 

275.29 276.24 B: right 

281.24 282.44 B: (( oh yeah )) 

281.48 293.97 A: and uh but but there's a they're a lot more people are a lot more encouraged to do some kind of uh work than they are to sit at home and and you know do nothing so 

293.08 298.57 B: yeah well they don't have the welfare system that we have here i guess and some of these other countries 

296.50 301.28 A: no so i think that i think that in a lot of respects that's 

301.25 310.05 A: uh a- and it's good and bad you know i mean there's good and bad on both set- both sides of it but then if you're if you're a company like you're starting out and you're a company 

306.36 307.24 B: right 

310.01 319.05 A: i mean the companies that that lay these people off are the ones that have to uh bear the brunt of a lot of the uh unemployment costs you know 

318.55 323.70 B: but isn't that unemployment taken out of their salary while they're working how does that work 

323.26 327.20 A: uh um well from what i understand yeah that's true 

327.27 338.38 A: to a point um i don't i think the company has to subsidize it i think a part of it is taken out of their salaries uh but it's a very small part like an insurance payment 

337.91 341.59 B: oh really i wasn't quite sure how unemployment insurance worked 

341.18 344.44 A: yeah so so these companies that uh 

344.68 356.08 A: uh makes it real tough for them to uh to to hire people i mean you see what you see more of right now is you see a lot of companies going to contracting you know they contract help 

355.52 357.06 B: mhm 

356.45 361.47 A: and instead of hiring them because they end up having to to uh 

361.65 367.89 A: you know put all the extras like the unemployment insurance on the individual and they have to you know they have to do a lot more 

366.95 368.55 B: yeah mhm 

368.30 369.51 A: um 

369.01 374.25 B: so when so they contract is that just like they pay 'em a fee they don't take taxes out and 

373.58 380.49 A: right right right like they're pretty much on their own t- to handle their own finances and that ther- that includes the withholdings 

374.37 375.39 B: yeah 

380.53 382.76 B: right yeah and th- 

381.86 383.21 A: including uh 

383.36 386.40 A: you know unemployment insurance and all that other stuff 

385.97 389.82 B: yeah and i guess that makes more sense for the companies either 

389.16 401.03 A: so what's happening is we've actually driven a lot of these companies now to go more and more to contracting people so the minimum wage uh issue is getting to be more and more of a mute a moot point you know 

395.45 396.60 B: really 

401.22 402.09 B: mm 

401.23 411.57 A: you you hire somebody to do a job for a period of time and you pay 'em a bulk salary and a lot of that's driven because of of things like minimum wage and things like the unemployment 

411.60 420.38 A: that cause companies to have to take away uh and and find a way to provide work or get work done um 

411.80 412.88 B: mhm 

421.06 423.39 A: and without employing people 

423.28 426.36 B: ha i never thought of it that way that's interesting 

423.75 424.87 A: full time 

426.38 429.15 B: do you know anyone who's working for minimum wage 

426.42 427.33 A: yeah 

429.64 430.75 A: uh 

431.15 435.60 A: not currently i have known people that have worked for it but no i don't know anybody right now 

434.92 437.57 B: yeah w- was it um 

436.83 447.74 A: a lot of people that i know i mean uh don't get me wrong i do know some people that are working and they're not making uh over minimum wage right now but they're not contracted we're not uh 

444.91 445.84 B: mhm 

447.94 461.15 A: they're not drawing a salary that's quote unquote minimum wage but when you stop and figure the number of hours it takes them to do the job they're doing and you divide that by the number of hours they're doing it comes out to less than minimum wage 

451.46 452.60 B: mhm 

460.73 462.40 B: (( mm yeah that )) 

461.83 464.88 A: and that'd be like a contracting situation see it 

465.00 466.81 B: well that's kinda depressing 

466.70 474.56 A: it is but there there are people that are doing that and i do know i do know some people that are doing that right now and it is depressing 

474.54 481.17 B: yeah and they say if you have to if you if you get just a fee and you have to pay your own taxes you pay a higher rate of taxes 

481.28 483.14 A: yeah yeah it's true 

482.35 485.18 B: so so you're losing there too 

484.79 493.52 A: mhm so when you stop and think about it um a lot of uh things like this like minimum wage are driving companies to 

493.93 507.93 A: contract people and and actually it works out to be less than minimum wage and people have no benefits and no fixed job they're basically having to work like you know a six month contract or a thirty day contract or whatever it is 

498.81 499.76 B: mhm 

507.15 509.39 B: right yeah and then 

508.49 510.20 A: to get the work done 

509.62 513.63 B: right right oh boy i never thought of that [laughter] 

513.16 518.82 A: yes so i mean and and actually that's kinda the way we're driving companies to to hire people now 

518.77 519.73 B: yeah 

518.85 530.27 A: so i mean i i think i would be better if you could kinda let uh the market deci- uh establish it's own uh you know bottom you know kinda like we're doing i mean 

528.21 529.34 B: mhm 

530.97 531.62 A: (( uh )) 

531.94 541.94 A: i mean i i i don't like the idea of of thinking that people have to work for minimum wage but i think you have to kinda like people are kind of responsible for themselves for say 

541.92 549.79 A: okay you're gonna pay me this much money well i'm not you know i'm not gonna work for that people have to decide where what's the least they'll take 

546.52 547.44 B: yeah 

549.55 550.72 B: right 

549.80 564.22 A: a- and there's people out there that i think wanna work but you know the- and they would take the jobs if the company would offer it for you know n- not necessarily be to pay a certain amount of do a certain thing for 'em a- 

563.46 564.93 B: right yeah 

564.34 578.24 A: and and uh there're jobs out there that are very unskilled and untechnical and companies aren't demanding a lot out of the employees and and they'll they're willing to they're willing to put them out there for less than minimum wage too 

578.13 579.45 B: mhm 

578.14 583.99 A: and some people would like to take 'em just for you know maybe a second job or little extra income 

581.92 583.15 B: right 

583.23 588.21 B: that's a good point too did they just raise the minimum wage or has it been 

584.63 585.61 A: so 

587.38 590.05 A: that's what that's what they said on this call 

589.26 590.61 B: oh they did say 

590.65 591.96 A: uh yeah 

591.37 594.90 B: i did- i wasn't aware i guess i just haven't kept up with 

594.46 598.49 A: well when you're not getting paid at that level i don't guess it really impacts you 

598.12 599.95 B: yeah are you getting call waiting
