0.16 1.75 A: hi i'm josie 

1.59 3.65 B: hi josie i'm penny 

3.71 4.85 A: hi penny 

4.67 11.30 B: hi i'm a little surprised five dollars and fifteen cents is the minimum wage i don't know where that is 

11.03 18.59 A: [noise] actually my brother was started off working at a wendy's and they started paying five fifteen and i was real surprised i thought that by now it'd be like six bucks or something 

18.50 21.78 B: well you know um i'm out here in um 

21.79 27.94 B: towards palm springs california and the minimum wage here is six dollar and seventy five cents so 

27.96 29.70 A: [noise] oh wow 

28.41 32.59 B: i mean that's the so i i didn't know it was five fifteen 

29.75 30.31 A: (( [noise] )) 

32.58 37.81 A: yeah that's actually down in miami it's actually been five fifteen for a while i think they moved it up to five twenty five 

37.44 38.50 B: mhm 

37.85 40.08 A: but i think they're thinking of cutting it back again 

39.83 41.04 B: (( [lipsmack] wow )) 

41.00 41.98 A: mhm 

41.66 48.58 B: well i know um i retired and moved out here and i had asked uh what the going wage was in the 

48.54 57.95 B: in this little toy store i was gonna work and that's when they said well it's minimum wage six dollars and seventy five cents so that's what i thought it was so i'm surprised 

56.46 57.23 A: yeah 

58.30 70.86 A: yeah in a lot of places where i uh either like a tourist place or something like that they usually start off paying more because if it is like a tourist area or stuff like that then they'll charge more for everything else so they'll just start at a higher price 

62.14 63.04 B: mhm 

64.23 65.42 B: oh okay 

70.42 74.05 B: well that makes sense and since where i live in a tourist area 

73.63 83.38 A: yeah so like right now i live in orlando and i just applied at i applied at a museum just doing um the well the admissions inside and i just started off at seven fifty 

76.01 76.92 B: oh 

78.05 79.04 B: mhm 

83.14 84.43 B: oh okay 

83.75 87.35 A: and i was expecting like ma- maximum like six bucks but 

87.19 89.14 B: oh what a surprise huh 

88.56 90.86 A: (( mhm so that's one good thing )) 

89.26 90.31 B: going big 

90.69 100.75 B: yeah well my uh husband works a couple a days um at a golf course out here and uh they pay seven dollars an hour for him so 

100.59 101.79 A: (( oh that's cool )) 

101.52 106.83 B: but you know i have a daughter that works as a um waitress in new hampshire 

106.86 115.43 B: and i think they pay three seventy five or four twenty five somewhere i don't know what it is right now but somewhere because they count her tips also as part of her 

114.13 115.91 A: yeah mm 

115.61 116.86 B: wage 

115.94 121.75 A: in mi- in miami it's like two fifty 'cause they do they t- they ta- they write it off as the tips mhm 

118.75 119.91 B: oh 

121.26 123.08 B: yeah that's terrible 

122.81 127.60 A: it's horrible 'cause if in one night you might make a hundred bucks but then the next two nights you might not make a single dollar 

127.34 131.65 B: that's true and some people just don't leave anything or might leave change or 

131.28 132.63 A: exactly 

132.13 137.13 B: it's amazing they'll give more money for somebody to move their car they'll give them a dollar 

137.03 137.84 A: mhm 

137.38 140.11 B: for a quick move my car 

139.92 141.39 A: mhm 

140.39 142.92 B: than they will for somebody that's uh eating 

142.10 144.23 A: been helping you all night basically 

143.25 145.01 B: yeah or so 

144.40 146.44 A: taking care of what going up but 

146.87 150.81 B: yes uh how do you feel about that minimum wage do you think that's 

151.04 154.54 B: a good five fifteen is a good beginning 

153.53 161.10 A: i uh i honestly don't know 'cause with everything going up so much i think it all depends on where you live um 'cause some areas are a lot cheaper than others 

157.10 158.11 B: yeah 

161.08 162.49 B: yeah that's true 

161.32 162.13 A: so 

162.32 167.07 A: yeah and right now i'm living in orlando where everything's very very very expensive 

166.74 171.65 B: yeah see you live the opposite i do 'cause palm spring is to orlando we're in the two 

171.76 172.75 B: big 

172.78 176.51 B: cities here where they e- everything's expensive 

173.87 175.01 A: exactly 

175.93 178.33 A: i don't think five fifteen would cut it at all here 

178.09 185.60 B: no and i i can't unless uh they were gonna get some type of commission i don't know who could live off that kinda money 

184.42 185.60 A: exactly 

185.59 194.20 B: you know and the people starting at that wage m- uh are people that probably can't go anywhere else or or or stuck with that 

192.64 195.60 A: exactly 'cause they have no other options mhm 

194.98 200.47 B: yeah and i and i just wonder like if it's a a chil- you know a teenager [lipsmack] starting out 

200.79 206.71 B: how do they ever get car insurance and they they couldn't possibly pay for their living expenses and 

203.12 204.05 A: mhm 

206.11 207.87 A: (( i know i know )) 

206.97 210.92 B: yeah so i i i i don't think that's good but 

211.09 211.85 B: then 

211.92 214.65 B: who can live off the money we're making [laughter] too 

214.26 219.73 A: basically [laughter] it's never enough but five fifteen would sure cut it short 

215.11 216.11 B: [laughter] 

216.15 216.92 B: so 

217.13 218.36 B: [laughter] no 

219.25 225.68 B: oh it'd be so much harder i- it'd make you feel like you were doing so much better at at uh 

221.24 222.36 A: right 

225.54 229.16 A: exactly i'm kinda glad it's seven fifty right now [laughter] 

226.37 227.41 B: yeah 

228.38 231.20 B: yeah [laughter] talk about 

229.70 232.08 A: wish it were more but exactly 

231.70 237.07 B: talk about it i'm starting to feel not too bad about my salary either at seven dollars it's okay 

235.01 236.31 A: [laughter] 

236.87 237.90 A: right 

237.43 238.57 B: (( yes )) 

238.74 240.11 B: so uh i 

239.11 240.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

240.32 241.58 B: are you uh 

242.03 244.89 B: have you got these topics before on the um 

244.73 248.05 A: i actually um this is actually my first time 

244.99 246.48 B: or is this your first 

247.67 256.29 B: oh okay well it's really interesting and i i i enjoy it and the ten minutes goes very fast and it's uh interesting talks on 

248.76 249.62 A: mhm 

256.34 258.84 A: yeah you get to meet new people that's cool 

256.87 259.78 B: every time it's something different yeah it is 

259.16 260.95 A: (( did you like )) 

260.48 264.68 B: yeah i think it is i don't quite uh know why they're doing it but okay 

264.67 269.26 A: i guess it's to see what the reactions are take polls and stuff like that so 

268.36 272.78 B: yeah it is because we're here's two perfect strangers we don't know each other and we're 

269.28 270.16 A: mhm 

272.82 274.92 B: talking about the minimum wage 

275.00 277.68 A: i i doubt this option would ever come anywhere else 

277.45 281.42 B: no i don't think i would bring it up in ordinary conversation 

280.14 281.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

281.32 282.59 A: right 

282.11 284.41 B: so well uh it's good 

283.49 284.47 A: that's cool 

284.47 285.44 B: (( so d- )) 

285.60 291.60 B: is that uh do you know the minimum wage out there for anybody other than waitresses or 

291.25 295.28 A: um well right now i know in miami for sure it's five twenty five 

294.99 297.18 B: oh it is f- five twenty five there 

295.73 298.23 A: yeah i i th- i believe it's five twenty five 

298.05 299.10 B: huh 

298.63 304.77 A: but um here in orlando i honestly don't know i just know when i i just -plied applied in the first place i got and it came up to seven fifty 

304.88 306.20 B: wow 

305.89 307.72 A: so i got really really lucky 

307.54 309.35 B: oh that's excellent 

307.94 310.12 A: i know that much mhm 

309.53 310.78 B: that's excellent 

310.71 316.05 A: [lipsmack] and uh um do you have any other kids or or are you gonna start working or anything like that or just one daughter 

310.93 311.72 B: well 

315.15 321.66 B: no i it's a daughter i have a son but he's ventured off into his own uh business he's in 

321.92 324.08 B: he uh he opened up his own uh 

324.57 326.91 B: repairing refrigerators and um 

326.66 327.87 A: oh that's cool 

328.21 330.85 B: and he's seen like that [sigh] yeah he 

330.10 334.23 A: so is it like his own business or is he like he started on like just the minimum wage also 

334.22 343.00 B: no you know what he he w- went to um new hampshire where my daughter lives and was went in there as a cook and was making four twenty five an hour 

343.20 344.59 A: [noise] oh wow 

344.26 347.47 B: yeah so that was horrible but then uh 

347.79 356.61 B: they gave him insurance and a lot of things with it that i guess was better but that that was hor- i mean he couldn't do it he moved in with her for a while and then he uh 

350.05 352.24 A: mm a lot of benefits 

356.95 360.31 B: got an in with appliance repair and and um 

360.66 363.29 B: decided he could do it just as well on his own 

363.44 364.40 A: yeah 

363.64 366.08 B: and uh now he does very well 

366.42 369.94 A: yep 'cause at four fifteen really can't cut it for one person living by themselves 

369.62 377.67 B: no no i i i don't know uh i don't i don't even know how i'm and in if you lived in a cold state and you got the minimum wage 

377.70 380.63 B: how would you pay for your heating or any of that which is 

379.58 380.69 A: exactly 

380.83 385.06 B: you know is in or even here i i suppose there too we 

385.08 389.92 B: i live in the desert so we have extreme heat and we need the air conditioning 

386.51 387.53 A: yeah 

389.17 391.09 A: air conditioning yeah 

390.39 393.43 B: so i i is it like that where you live as well 

392.79 397.79 A: it's there's days where it's really really hot and there's days where it's really really cold and then there's good days but mostly it's hot here 

397.40 398.60 B: mhm 

398.03 408.15 A: but it's like the humid hot it's not like dry hot like in the desert which is kinda nice 'cause it's just hot but you're not really really sweaty or smell anything like that like here it's like really really humid hot so if you don't have your a._c. 

402.39 403.27 B: mhm 

404.58 405.47 B: no 

406.92 407.92 B: oh 

408.26 413.76 A: then i'm pretty sure two people living together with minimum wage really wouldn't cut it at all 

409.15 410.02 B: yeah 

412.71 417.51 B: [laughter] they they wouldn't make it long together would they 

417.18 419.17 A: living all together that's about it 

418.57 423.72 B: [laughter] uh yeah and the thing is they certainly wouldn't get rich 

423.43 426.45 A: yep that's for sure can't move up too much with minimum wage 

424.50 425.49 B: (( wow you )) 

426.17 437.19 B: you know that's probably why a lot of people uh particularly the uh foreigners uh that get a lot of minimum wage jobs why they work so many hours you know 

433.39 434.24 A: mhm 

436.34 438.15 A: and always stay in the same spot 

437.95 444.48 B: yeah they they if you ever notice they they work two and three jobs so it's that's why 

444.30 445.55 A: mhm 

444.92 448.64 B: they're not um making any money and they have to have to do it 

448.43 454.34 A: and usually it's not even a sturdy job you see them cutting the grass or something like that and they just get like little tips and stuff but it's not really like sturdy 

454.04 455.23 B: yeah 

454.38 456.19 A: like forty hours type thing 

456.21 460.37 B: yeah we have a a lot of 'em out here 'cause i live on a golf course 

460.11 461.27 A: mhm 

460.41 467.20 B: so they're always uh cutting lawns and and doing a lot of wor- and you see a lot of uh hispanic out here 

463.07 464.90 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

466.52 468.22 A: mhm 

467.72 468.70 B: so i 

468.82 473.44 B: i don't i i don't know any to ask 'em what they make i wouldn't do that anyway 

473.19 487.25 A: yeah but i'm pretty sure they'd be like to take a job that paid five fifteen which is which is good in a sense because they'd be making more money than what they're making but bad in a sense because other people who need to make more money if they make five fifteen minimum wage they'd be happy to but other people would be bad 

473.94 475.26 B: but i'm sure that 

482.87 483.88 B: mhm 

486.84 490.50 B: sure anybody that's a step up from what you're making 

487.76 488.75 A: mhm 

489.96 491.19 A: exactly 

490.67 496.02 B: is good but yeah i i don't know i don't know where they're gonna get money to 

496.19 499.20 B: do anything anyway the way things are looking kinda 

499.02 500.33 A: mhm 

499.69 502.60 B: plus it's good that you got a job because uh i 

502.97 508.39 B: guess the job e- employment is uh very low right now that i mean very high 

506.74 509.51 A: yeah m- yeah mhm 

508.80 511.58 B: there's a lot of people unemployed so maybe 

512.10 517.16 B: but they say a lot of uh young people won't take jobs if they're uh minimum wage they they 

517.35 518.73 B: they don't wanna do it 

518.45 522.01 A: i guess 'cause it's the their um i'm actually eighteen 

521.69 523.06 B: mhm 

522.43 530.51 A: usually what they wanna do like find their first good job that pays well and stuff like that but nowadays it's getting really really hard 'cause of the economy how it is and stuff like that 

527.72 528.83 B: oh yeah 

529.93 531.23 B: yes it is 

530.95 533.43 A: mhm [noise] anybody just take a minimum wage if they can 

533.27 535.57 B: sure just to get some money right now 

534.87 536.32 A: (( [noise] exactly [noise] )) 

535.93 543.26 B: not on that you get y- you being eighteen all you're doing is you're anything that you do will only build on your resume anyway 

543.01 544.02 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

543.66 547.54 B: so that'll only somewhere down the line will help you 

547.67 551.07 B: so that that's good and you're you that's a interesting 

547.87 549.82 A: mhm

554.02 557.23 A: mhm actually work at a at a ripley's museum 

554.43 555.48 B: you know [lipsmack] 

556.96 559.28 B: oh that's even more interesting 

558.58 560.67 A: yeah it's very interesting there 

560.26 561.28 B: (( yeah 'cause )) 

560.82 561.79 A: (( [cough] ))
