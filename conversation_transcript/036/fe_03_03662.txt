0.38 2.06 B: hi i'm eric 

1.94 3.52 A: (( hi i'm mike )) 

3.54 4.31 B: (( hi )) 

4.51 7.66 B: well rough topic i have no idea [laughter] 

6.92 9.02 A: (( you have no idea about what they )) 

9.21 14.01 A: (( and be there with five dollars an hour for minimum wage is not good i )) 

13.93 20.76 B: yeah i know certainly someone who's working fulltime you know forty hours a week you know he couldn't really uh 

14.25 15.10 A: (( mean )) 

21.12 23.75 B: raise a family and get by 

23.91 25.13 A: yeah that's 

23.95 25.03 B: making that 

25.57 30.97 A: that type of wage is for a young person single 

30.99 33.87 A: with you know just starting out 

33.44 34.88 B: no commitments 

34.70 36.85 A: right no type of commitments 

35.07 35.89 B: yeah 

37.63 40.13 A: (( roughly maybe living at your mom's house )) 

39.66 41.63 B: exactly yeah 

40.29 42.26 A: (( [laughter] you see what i'm saying )) 

42.16 43.04 B: yeah 

42.37 45.92 A: so you know 'cause they can't really do anything with that 

46.06 52.14 A: but you know i i can't believe that minimum wage is still running around i thought we would boost it up by now 

52.44 63.45 B: yeah i think i'm in my thirties and i think when i was a teenager it was uh three thirty five an hour so it seems pretty bad that in the uh twenty years it's only gone up 

63.71 65.86 B: you know not even gone up two dollars an hour 

65.86 68.70 A: and yeah yeah so uh 

66.58 67.54 B: (( [laughter] )) 

68.88 73.14 A: um [sigh] i don't know what what [laughter] to do i 

73.35 77.23 A: mean what they said told me was they said look at the 

77.26 79.36 A: cost of living i mean they 

80.93 84.55 A: and boost it some you know it's like i mean they 

84.61 96.98 A: put everything else has gone up prices of food uh pro- ev- all products clothes everything is going up but why is the minimum wage still stuck there so so low 

86.66 87.59 B: right 

95.40 97.01 B: good question i 

97.58 99.92 B: (( guess i think hopefully um )) 

100.37 102.08 B: people who are 

102.38 106.61 B: you know responsible for more who aren't kids living at their parents homes can uh 

107.06 116.56 B: get jobs that are above the minimum wage i mean certainly they wouldn't be able to not everyone'd be able to get a high paying job but hopefully a there's more available to them than just uh 

116.62 118.66 B: you know fast food and the like 

119.39 120.70 A: yeah 

120.11 124.81 B: um really hope so of course i'm sure there's millions and millions of people who can't 

125.09 127.05 B: and who are stuck there uh 

127.90 137.15 A: yeah and wouldn't wouldn't it also have something to do with the sec- the private sector i mean let's say mcdonald's 

136.67 137.45 B: mm 

137.50 139.87 A: or stuff like that i mean wouldn't they 

140.26 143.95 A: it it should be their responsibility to boost it up also 

144.08 147.99 A: people say well okay we 'cause they're making billions of dollars 

147.37 148.87 B: yeah 

148.25 153.08 A: awful [laughter] awful people so why not boost it up and get that 

153.27 156.91 B: well i guess that's how they make their billions of dollars [laughter] 

153.69 154.45 A: but 

156.28 159.54 A: yes yeah that's true [laughter] 

158.84 166.51 B: yeah i guess they they pass it on to us and if uh they paid people at mcdonald's fifteen dollars an hour we'd be paying twelve dollars for a big mac 

166.88 168.11 B: (( [laughter] )) 

169.27 170.87 B: so there's yeah the 

170.76 171.66 A: (( mm mm )) 

171.49 177.72 B: it's a it's a rough well yeah it's so tough to talk about 'cause we don't disagree [laughter] there's not a lot to say 

175.37 185.87 A: hm mm yeah yeah [laughter] yeah um [lipsmack] but um also with that with this that 

186.28 189.23 A: i guess people have to 

189.33 192.19 A: teach responsibility also 

192.40 193.24 B: right 

192.63 196.50 A: in this you know uh av- while they're young 

196.69 197.69 B: right 

197.06 210.89 A: if you have your child and they're just starting to work and they're making the minimum wage you know teach them responsibility on what they uh you know what they're making how to save how to uh 

209.46 210.85 B: well that's a good point 

210.95 225.71 A: yeah how to uh pick money and spend it wisely you know put away and and all of that you know so because i guess a lot of us haven't taught our children a lot of us haven't been taught 

216.72 217.50 B: right 

225.53 226.32 B: mm 

225.83 231.16 A: we've just went out there and buy and then with all these people would they 

228.43 229.28 B: (( right yeah )) 

231.37 233.24 A: uh uh uh uh 

233.60 235.30 A: name brand you 

235.41 239.89 A: know outfits and all that so you know that's that's another thing too 

241.01 250.37 B: i guess another thing that's rough about the minimum i mean not if you're a kid but if you're an adult earning the minimum wage is just you know a matter of self worth feeling like a this you know 

250.62 251.50 A: you 

250.64 253.87 B: that i i'm earning the same thing that teenagers are are earning 

253.98 257.64 B: um i i heard a comedian say that uh 

257.92 265.86 B: what the minimum i mean he was joking obviously but what the minimum wage is it's like the boss saying i would pay you less but i'm not allowed to by law 

266.16 269.14 A: (( know yeah uh yeah yeah )) 

266.54 274.26 B: yeah so really that [laughter] uh you know that's how much i value you as an employee that uh the law is making me pay you this much 

271.36 272.38 A: yeah 

274.44 275.85 A: yeah 

274.97 277.08 B: that that's rough [laughter] 

276.20 278.53 A: (( oh dear that is that is very rough )) 

278.02 279.50 B: (( yeah )) 

278.91 281.88 A: (( very very rough yeah )) 

281.03 282.19 B: but um [sigh] 

282.57 294.52 B: yeah i mean it is rough 'cause th- there there i mean i think it needs to be higher than it is but there has to be some limit to it because again if it was fifteen dollars an hour that would be great but then everything would cost everyone more 

294.41 295.81 A: (( right )) 

294.82 298.47 B: including the people making say it was raised to fifteen dollars an hour 

298.64 303.29 B: people making fifteen dollars an hour at the minimum wage are are now going to be paying 

303.46 312.77 B: um a lot more money for everything than they were before so it's uh you know it's uh there's no there's n- there's no easy answer to it but 

307.44 308.98 A: (( right yeah )) 

312.65 319.13 B: but like we like you and i both agree that five fifteen an hour is just 

312.78 313.91 A: right 

319.20 320.09 B: not 

319.51 333.05 A: yeah just too low i i guess what i'm trying to put my- myself into the shoes of politics or whatever you know on who's making decisions on how to grade this 

333.30 336.05 A: maybe they are thinking well 

336.10 338.65 A: okay if you wanna do more 

338.81 341.19 A: you have to get a skill 

342.79 353.47 A: a set of skill okay it's not an incentive but if they're saying well hey i want i i deserve more so why don't i go out and 

353.74 356.99 A: get me a uh a a trade 

356.60 357.72 B: (( mm mm right )) 

357.16 360.82 A: some type of uh you know 'cause i'm a technician myself 

360.89 374.92 A: and you know 'cause a it's a struggle when you [laughter] you don't have and you wanna buy and all you make and all you can do is well pay rent but a little bit of food and that's it 

366.88 367.74 B: yeah 

374.34 375.58 B: yeah 

375.19 378.81 A: you know and you still have to have money for transportation 

378.53 379.57 B: mhm 

379.00 379.95 A: so 

380.79 388.11 A: so you know um yeah 'cause i had to do th- do all that and i decided hey pick up a book 

388.26 391.02 A: (( [laughter] and started to read [laughter] )) 

388.67 389.87 B: [laughter] 

389.88 391.65 B: good for you that's great 

391.05 396.86 A: b- book up and start read and start and started learning asked for help 

396.87 400.56 A: on you know down the road but you have to want it 

400.70 401.86 B: (( right that's great )) 

400.95 404.39 A: so th- i guess that's getting off the topic a little bit but 

403.68 412.10 B: no but that but that's one way to uh try to um avoid the minimum wage or do better than the minimum wage is is help yourself 

409.06 409.98 A: yeah 

410.52 411.49 A: (( mhm yep )) 

412.75 414.08 A: yep 

413.40 414.63 B: yeah that's wonderful 

415.47 416.79 B: yeah i'm i'm 

416.15 417.03 A: yeah 

416.88 418.44 B: lucky to have uh 

418.86 428.01 B: um have parents that could pay for at least part of my college and i uh borrowed the rest of the money so that i you know wasn't in a position to earn minimum wage after 

428.07 432.24 B: you know after being in college so i was lucky in that way 

429.14 429.86 A: yeah 

431.40 445.62 A: oh okay well yeah you lucky yeah yeah some of us that wasn't so lucky and we did have to do it but but uh if yes if if uh a sense of value when you try to 

445.40 450.40 A: yes and instill that in your child and your child have to want it also 

450.74 451.89 A: so 

451.36 453.31 B: and feel like he is a 

453.59 454.86 B: he's worth it yeah 

454.34 459.47 A: he's worth right he's worth more than just minimum wage 

455.67 456.49 B: yeah 

459.71 460.99 A: you know level 

460.63 461.89 B: yeah 

461.79 470.09 A: you know and then th- that goes to uh i mean this this this topic can can run all the way around the board of uh 

470.58 475.52 A: drugs and everything else because that is like your self esteem down 

475.23 477.73 B: (( yeah absolutely mm )) 

476.05 477.52 A: (( you see what i'm saying )) 

478.19 479.13 A: it's 

480.07 480.94 A: it's 

482.41 483.61 A: yeah 

484.20 489.32 A: but minimum wage they need to boost it a little bit just a little bit right 

488.57 500.81 B: yeah enough enough so that people can earn more but not so much that it's going to uh send ripples throughout our economy and raise all of our prices up and uh have us be all unhappy that we were behind it [laughter] 

494.93 495.95 A: (( right )) 

496.38 497.31 A: right 

500.10 502.24 A: yeah [laughter] yep 

502.21 503.05 B: uh 

502.53 506.35 A: but what so what would you think that would be a good uh 

506.39 510.84 A: uh um number okay you say it's five well it's five fifteen 

510.37 512.37 B: that's yeah [sigh] 

511.98 513.54 A: (( five fifteen )) 

512.68 516.41 B: oh boy the the number seven is coming into my head but you know 

515.90 520.62 A: uh seven okay so let's see who make seven dollars an hour 

520.91 523.07 A: (( um [sigh] )) 

523.17 523.89 B: (( what )) 

523.73 528.54 A: because the scale of a technical ranges from 

528.77 530.79 A: uh eight 

531.89 540.34 A: oh no maybe ten that's the lowest but a technician should get uh a huh d._c.

567.32 578.70 B: um he just has to have some knowledge of power equipment if someone tells him a certain type of part he's gotta know what it looks like which i couldn't do but you know someone like that coming in off the street can earn eight dollars an hour 

572.21 573.00 A: (( mhm ))
