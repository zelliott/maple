0.39 2.99 A: hello uh my name's wade ky 

3.83 5.75 B: hi my name is mark 

5.97 7.05 A: how you doing 

6.93 7.72 B: good 

7.51 14.70 A: [laughter] okay um well so we're supposed to talk about minimum wage being increased to five fifteen that 

14.13 17.16 B: and and is that sufficient 

16.14 20.82 A: oh i don't believe it is and i live in california and i think it's six twenty five here actually 

21.26 24.73 A: already i i think it's more than the national i guess or something 

24.61 28.14 B: yeah that that's what i was gonna comment there might be a uh 

28.50 34.79 B: a uh uh uh a prorated on a on a regionalized basis because 

33.79 34.89 A: yeah 

35.08 41.57 B: i used to live up in massachusetts and i thought it was it was like five fifty and that was like five years ago 

39.38 40.35 A: mhm 

41.34 48.85 A: uh yeah no yeah i it's this i think yeah we're like five fifteen like a while ago like five years ago or something 

41.98 43.12 B: so i 

48.28 55.57 B: i think what ends up happening is is that there is a national set standard that you can't be lower than 

55.16 56.02 A: uh-huh 

55.56 58.13 B: and so that is the minimum wage 

58.09 66.52 B: and then for competitive reasons i think various states and or regions set them differently because they know that you know no one's gonna work for them 

66.16 67.15 A: yeah 

66.38 79.02 B: at that rate and knowing the cost of living in a particular area so then they they adjust it up but i think what it it there may be a mandated national level that you have to give at least x amount 

69.58 70.54 A: yeah 

76.09 76.98 A: (( uh )) 

78.67 82.15 A: okay and that would be raised from whatever it is to five fifteen 

82.09 83.64 B: that's what i'm guessing 

82.93 83.93 A: okay 

83.81 98.78 A: well yeah i don't i definitely don't think that's sufficient i would say i know i mean i think anything short of a real living wage has to be calculated like as for like the region you live in and how what the cost of living is there and things like that it should be on a much more municipal level 

84.05 85.39 B: (( that's what i'm guessing )) 

94.14 96.05 B: [noise] 

98.83 110.64 B: well i think what ends up happening is th- th- the limit that's been put forth by business owners is they're saying if you force me to pay seven dollars an hour as a minimum nation wide 

109.63 110.95 A: mhm 

111.38 122.35 B: you may think that that's creating money in the economy so that people in the lower income scale will have a better living they'll put that money back into the economy and it will actually help what i'm trying to tell you as a business owner is 

122.14 126.67 B: you force me to pay seven dollars i got ten people i'm laying off three 

127.07 134.27 B: and then i and still gonna be fulltime having a minimum wage of seven i'm gonna hire par- part timers and pay 'em four dollars 

128.34 130.07 A: hm 

134.15 146.74 B: so the small business owner's saying that's putting enough hardship on me uh to force me to pay that kind of money and so th- and that's you know so the democrats and the republicans go back and forth on that in terms of is it good is it bad 

135.88 138.06 A: hm 

143.55 145.30 A: yeah 

146.66 158.77 B: i think what's been demonstrated over time is that raising the minimum wage has always helped does not hurt there is a short term flux of pain and suffering 

153.15 155.92 A: definitely definitely 

158.74 170.56 B: and and i'm a republican at heart there's a short term flux of pain and suffering it eventually does get adjusted i- it's so- it's something that has get used to they find other ways to save money they they trim expenses here or there 

164.24 164.99 A: (( mm )) 

171.82 175.12 B: i think uh in other cases what happens is is that 

175.04 183.53 B: they'll tell a- they'll tell employee that whatever minimum amount of benefits they're also giving they say okay i'll tell you what i'll pay you seven dollars minimum wage 

183.44 191.45 B: but you know that free dental it ain't free anymore [laughter] or that dental that you were paying ten dollars a month for it's now fifty 

186.27 188.14 A: mhm 

190.97 197.37 A: well yeah see i think um i think i'm a big that's where i don't think i think minimum wage should both be like something that could really be a 

197.27 209.16 A: living wage and benefits should be there too and i think if if things were skimmed off of other things you know like like you know subsidies the corporations are like uh you know the military budget or whatever 

208.88 209.93 B: exactly 

208.99 212.99 A: that could be done really easily and everyone everyone could come out just fine 

212.86 215.36 B: well now the other side of the coin is is that 

215.49 227.51 B: if i'm gonna have to raise my if the if the cost of of my employees is rai- is costing me more money then obviously there's only one other choice i have and that's to raise the price of my services 

225.60 227.42 A: mhm 

227.36 232.35 B: well that's the other argument of some of these business owners is that you know i'm pricing myself out the market so 

232.60 241.93 B: if this keeps going and nobody wants my product because now it's too expensive then i don't have any employees who are getting paid anything i got a a i gotta close down 

236.31 237.60 A: mhm 

239.11 240.45 A: yeah that's true 

241.55 255.51 A: yeah totally well i mean like if you look at like say like mcdonald's or something you know one of the biggest minimum wage employers out there eh you know i mean if they raised every you know how many thousands of hamburgers does each little mcdonald's sell in a day if they raised the price like five cents 

255.45 262.13 A: [laughter] how that could like afford to like it'd probably give each of their employees you know a fifty cent raise or whatever 

261.64 269.42 B: well see now now that's interesting you should bring that up because the other side of that coin is that in a a company like mcdonald's 

269.43 271.30 B: a corporation like mcdonald's 

272.37 287.37 B: th- they'll pay the minimum wage for the people who are just coming on board or just getting trained but mcdonald's also recognizes that if you incentivize people i'll pay you more if you do a good job if you really want to contribute to the to the uh 

277.77 279.50 A: mhm 

287.30 292.82 B: uh profitability of this particular mcdonald's store i i'll do more for you 

290.54 292.06 A: [laughter] 

292.71 305.68 A: yeah well i i think it's pretty hard to get to that level though where you're getting more the minimum wage i mean and it's such a you know i mean the the morale's so low because people are getting so little and working harder than most people that make more than that you know 

292.90 294.99 B: (( so mcdonald's well you )) 

305.50 308.07 A: it's hard for that to work 

305.54 307.05 B: see that's the thing 

307.15 314.55 B: see that's the thing is that when you look at a corporation like mcdonald's and you go to mickey d's university where they actually exist 

313.29 315.50 A: [laughter] 

314.38 323.75 B: i mean they seriously they have a training program and they and they lay out of a pathway for you that you can work your way up to shift manager and associate manager and all this kind of stuff 

316.41 317.32 A: uh-huh 

320.59 323.07 A: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

323.59 335.10 B: and then eventually you might even actually be sharing in the profits you know you'll get bonuses and things like that that's great i tell you what gino's hoagy shop can't do that and that's because 

326.95 327.74 A: (( uh-huh )) 

332.72 333.59 A: mhm 

333.93 338.99 A: but but it's different though because gino's hoagy shop will probably pay you more off the bat 

335.59 336.31 B: (( the )) 

338.85 352.98 A: and you'll be treated better you know and you'll probably be you you'll have a different it's a different kind of atmosphere where like people will usually will work harder and are willing to work a little harder and also are feeling better about the whole thing no productivity and higher moral 

350.42 351.79 B: well i i think what 

353.40 367.63 B: exactly but i think what happens is that at gino's hoagy shop for example gino kinda slides past under the table and says thanks that was a nice job and the reason i can slide you that cash is 'cause i don't have to pay you seven dollars an hour i only have to pay 

356.70 358.90 A: [laughter] mhm 

366.13 367.43 A: (( exact- oh )) 

367.83 370.66 B: (( only have to pay you five [noise] )) 

369.08 382.70 A: yeah well ma- yeah maybe if it's under the table too but also you know when there's a tip jar there and there's a little bit of extra you know money you know like people who work as waiters and waitresses like i mean they they usually get less than minimum wage or depending on where they work but the more 

372.83 374.38 B: (( [noise] )) 

375.76 377.64 B: that's it 

381.66 385.08 B: oh absolutely i i've been there i've done that 

382.80 388.71 A: and yeah yeah me too and you know but like the thing is you do come home with some cash every night you know 

388.66 391.94 B: exactly that uncle sam didn't see 

388.85 389.74 A: (( so )) 

391.18 393.71 A: exactly exactly 

391.97 395.06 B: i mean that's the reality i think uncle sam knows it too 

394.77 396.10 A: (( yeah )) 

395.41 401.38 B: i mean that's why when i was a waiter i used to cringe when somebody would pay with a credit card 'cause oh god i gotta claim that that's 

400.40 405.09 A: yeah exactly exactly [laughter] mhm 

402.06 411.47 B: there's a paper trail i don't know you know that's funny you should mention that you know they talk about this national minimum wage and yet just like you said it seems like there's exceptions 

410.78 412.68 A: mhm 

411.37 424.68 B: you know for these waiters and waitresses they don't have to be paid minimum wage but these people over here working at the uh you know the the guy who's helping out at the seers auto body shop he he's gotta get his seven dollars 

421.59 423.01 A: yeah 

423.49 434.58 A: yeah yeah yeah totally but you know i mean most people who are working at a auto body shop are getting more than minimum wage too they're getting and they're probably getting benefits yeah exactly yeah exactly like um 

429.39 431.40 B: well a lot of 'em are with union too 

433.58 445.44 B: and that's and that's and that's why unions i think are still so successful even though i think unions are actually getting in the way of productivity because the guy who's been around for twenty five years you can't fire him he's got seniority 

440.60 441.35 A: (( mm )) 

443.53 446.52 A: yeah yeah yeah 

445.34 453.94 B: and yet he's you know he's slacking where- whereas the young kid who really wants to do good you know and really wants to show some like hey you're the first one on the line g- 

447.20 449.10 A: yeah 

452.89 454.48 A: he's gotta pay his dues 

454.23 456.49 B: grab the fine and start walking 

455.86 457.65 A: yeah totally 

456.93 467.77 B: so so then so so yeah you're you're you're a new kid and you're saying okay i don't wanna go to union i'd rather rather just be independent but at the same time with what they pay in minimum wage i can't make a living 

467.09 474.37 A: yeah well that's and that's why the unions you know that's the purpose of the unions is that at least in theory you know everyone's gonna come out on top because 

474.20 484.44 A: they're gonna they're gonna work together you know with big solidarity with each other and the in theory everyone who who gets into that union they're gonna pay some dues but they're gonna come out on top for it 

481.85 483.02 B: (( well he- )) 

483.67 490.88 B: here's something that i don't know and i'd be curious about when was the last time minimum wage was increased and by what percent i mean if 

489.65 504.01 A: i th- i know i think clinton did it in like it might have been in his first presidency actually um i think it was probably the second and i don't know the percent i don't really remember but i thought it was i thought it was like six twenty five i thought that was actually the national one but i guess not 

498.35 499.65 B: because i 

502.40 517.15 B: okay because what i oh the other thing i'm wondering too is is that yes we have low inflation but inflation is inflation even if it's two percent so if the last time the minimum wage was raised was in i don't know nineteen ninety you know nineteen ninety 

509.43 511.43 A: yeah yeah 

517.06 519.36 A: no i think it was like ninety five at least 

517.30 518.19 B: oh 

518.95 522.66 B: okay okay so so it it's still five seven years ago 

522.60 524.10 A: yeah i think so 

522.76 531.56 B: right that was the last time it was raised and let's say it was raised by five percent in the meantime it hasn't changed at all and two percent inflation has increased year on year on year 

527.74 529.47 A: mhm 

530.16 532.10 A: mhm 

531.38 538.50 B: so what used to cost a dollar now's a dollar two now it's a dollar six now it's a dollar ten and you're money hasn't changed 

536.47 537.50 A: yeah 

537.88 548.44 A: exactly well and and if you look at like uh i'm i'm a a i been like interested in sociology for a while and like if you look at studies they do basically since about nineteen seventy two or something 

543.88 544.65 B: yeah 

548.21 556.85 A: the uh amount of actual like p- buying power whatever has dropped like consistently since then so if people are getting paid you know 

554.75 556.64 B: yeah it ha- it's declined 

556.70 566.71 A: because and like as rates go up even though like wages have gone up since then the minimum wage has gone up it hasn't gone up steadily with the ra- with the uh increase of inflation so 

566.40 568.89 B: inflation costs of goods and services 

568.43 577.16 A: yeah so so basically people have less money less less uh money power than they did twenty twenty thirty years ago yeah exactly 

568.94 570.87 B: co- cost of healthcare 

573.19 575.78 B: (( le- less disposable income )) 

576.11 590.23 B: yeah i agree with you i mean it's a tough thing i mean i don't know if there would be such a thing as establishing a minimum wage national minimum wage that is inflation inflation adjusted uh every other year let's say 

587.95 591.66 A: mhm mhm yeah 

590.36 599.89 B: s- so that we don't have to go through this national legislation everyone can plan for it i the number's been set i'll just make this up the number's been set at seven dollars and me as a business owner 

594.67 596.46 A: mhm 

598.73 599.89 A: mhm
