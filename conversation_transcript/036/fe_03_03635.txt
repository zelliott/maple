13.66 15.55 A: oh wow [laughter] 

16.37 22.60 A: i thought uh the minimum wage they just set on the this thing out here the minimum wage i think is six seventy five an hour 

22.73 23.57 B: um 

22.76 25.16 A: but i guess that's not the national uh 

25.35 28.33 A: i guess that's not the national minimum wage do you know what it is 

27.18 33.06 B: i think i think it's five eighty fi- five sixty five or five eighty five in kentucky 

33.08 35.75 B: um which i think is extremely low 

35.61 42.12 A: yeah [noise] i can't imagine and i don't think they're gonna uh hear from many people that don't think it should go up right because uh 

42.62 48.86 A: it's uh yeah it's too low i think even if you worked forty hours a week for that much money you're still gonna be uh 

49.32 52.26 A: you're gonna be uh living in poverty right 

51.69 58.26 B: yeah or have to work two or three jobs [laughter] yeah i think it's uh extremely low 

54.33 55.50 A: mhm 

59.10 66.76 A: and i guess that uh i don't know why these what are people uh you know what's the argument against raising it it's it's i guess you know that it's 

66.95 72.17 A: it's uh you know too hard on small businesses or something but uh you know it's like uh 

72.42 76.66 A: it's good for the economy you know if people are making more money really i think than uh 

77.26 82.73 A: i don't know i've worked uh i've worked at some jobs for minimum wage and it really doesn't uh 

83.52 84.66 A: (( to your uh )) 

85.32 89.95 A: you just uh you just don't make enough money to to live i don't think 

89.43 93.08 B: right doesn't pay off you're uh always 

93.33 97.95 B: struggling or or looking for something else to make a little extra 

98.76 105.41 A: yeah 'cause i think i guess i think it's about you know before taxes even you know it's like less than two hundred and fifty dollars a week and then 

105.48 108.60 A: if you take out taxes and you're working forty hours for 

108.71 113.57 A: for about six dollars an hour you're only gonna be taking home like two hundred dollars a week and uh 

113.78 116.70 A: i don't you know people just can't live with that uh 

117.28 118.83 A: making that much money 

118.52 121.10 B: exactly especially if they have families 

120.76 123.83 A: (( y- yeah but um )) 

124.74 127.40 A: i don't know i mean i guess that uh i 

127.42 132.15 A: mean there must be some uh day they haven't raised it in a long time too 'cause it's been i guess 

132.41 137.75 A: i can remember when it was like three something i'm thirty years old now i got sick the first job i had i made 

137.08 138.32 B: you're how old 

138.13 139.34 A: i'm thirty 

138.93 139.83 B: uh-huh 

139.59 146.43 A: but i think i made i think the first job i had i made three twenty five an hour that's about and that 

145.32 150.41 B: well i'm thirty nine and the first job i had i made three thirty five an hour 

147.44 148.21 A: mhm 

150.06 151.34 A: mhm 

150.71 153.77 B: um and that was in kentucky [noise] 

153.15 154.29 A: yeah 

154.64 156.45 A: and it just uh 

156.21 170.19 A: yeah it hasn't i don't think it's even gone up so that's like you know that's over te- that's over ten years ago probably like almost fifteen years ago and it's only gone up a couple of dollars it's i don't think it's even i don't even think it's kept up with uh inflation or whatever so 

170.46 171.70 A: they uh 

170.50 171.72 B: oh right 

172.91 181.52 A: definitely need to raise it and it's like you know most of most of the jobs where people make that much money are are part time jobs anyway where they try to keep you you know under forty 

182.11 185.46 A: hours you know a lot of places to keep you from uh 

185.70 187.91 B: getting the benefits that goes with it 

186.33 189.47 A: [lipsmack] yeah exactly yeah 

190.23 191.55 A: but uh 

192.94 198.27 A: yeah i don't know i guess i have a the job i work at now i make an hourly wage and it's like uh 

198.52 202.02 A: a little over nine dollars an hour and uh 

202.79 208.29 A: you know it's not uh it's not [laughter] pretty much money even you know even that 

207.73 211.80 B: right exactly um i i'm a school bus driver 

211.47 212.43 A: oh yes 

212.18 214.66 B: and i make twelve dollars an hour 

214.42 215.68 A: mhm 

215.05 218.23 B: um which is really the most i've ever made on a job 

218.46 222.59 B: but i work for we're county but we're considered state 

222.73 223.65 A: uh-huh 

222.98 227.26 B: state employees and i guess that's the reason for the high wage 

227.59 230.64 A: you have to you have to have a special license too right 

230.04 233.00 B: yes we have to have a commercial driver's license 

232.61 233.60 A: mhm 

233.52 234.40 B: um 

234.72 238.18 B: which of course you have to have renewed every few years 

237.75 238.58 A: yeah 

238.86 240.42 B: but it's uh 

241.18 243.23 B: that really is even hard to live on 

243.36 244.24 A: yeah 

243.41 248.41 B: you know the twelve dollars and i couldn't imagine making minimum wage again [laughter] 

247.98 248.96 A: (( yeah )) 

249.10 253.35 A: i mean i i it's like you know there's some you know like i guess you know 

253.54 256.39 A: sometimes maybe it's okay if uh you know if 

256.44 263.08 A: teenagers are making that kind of money or i guess uh you know i understand they wanna pay that much at like a fast food place or something but uh 

263.25 265.75 A: i you know it just doesn't seem like because 

266.33 272.44 A: i think you know i think even if it went up you know the people that would be complaining you know the people who would have to pay it but uh 

272.43 283.98 A: you know the money winds up you know it's it's it's better for everybody in the end 'cause there's more money in you know it like helps the economy in the end if people are making more money 'cause then they have more money to spend it's really uh 

281.80 283.22 B: (( right mhm )) 

285.00 290.65 A: but and i think it's a pretty straight like republican democrat type of uh thing i think from 

290.68 295.24 A: you know it's sort of like the democrats that would propose raising it and the republicans that'll be 

295.58 301.27 A: be against raising it and they'll say that you know it's like the businesses can't afford it or something but uh 

301.53 302.92 A: i just uh 

303.25 306.53 A: yeah i think it's it's it's probably overdue i mean 

306.63 307.69 A: some 

307.71 309.22 A: some uh 

310.14 318.95 A: some i guess some places it depends on on where you are too the cost of living is higher other like here i know california actually has a state i guess they have a state uh 

318.96 321.76 A: minimum wage you know that's a little bit higher here 

322.05 323.45 A: (( but um )) 

322.92 324.90 B: well you have to your your 

325.14 328.39 B: house payments are usually like a thousand dollars a month right 

328.62 335.30 A: yeah i mean i rent but yeah i it's it's the cost of living is is higher you know especially even just 'cause i'm in the city too 

335.34 336.77 B: and taxes 

335.56 341.17 A: um yeah everything's a little bit the the sales tax is really high here and uh 

341.39 351.73 A: um yeah the cost of living is it's higher in the city for sure i think i mean it's refracted somewhat you know in the places you know places will pay a little bit more 

351.51 352.47 B: uh-huh 

352.07 353.46 A: but um 

353.76 362.66 A: s- you know i could unders- i it sorta makes sense to me that there would be maybe like different minimum wages depending on where where you're at you know that uh 

363.50 367.26 A: that would somehow reflect the different cost of living or something you know 

366.98 374.60 B: right it's like i live in a city i mean lowville's not a real big city um compared to probably los angeles i'm sure 

374.94 380.26 B: but i've lived all over the world and i know the smaller towns that you live in it seems like 

380.51 381.52 B: um 

383.08 387.62 B: groceries for instance may be much more than they are in the city 

387.44 388.40 A: mhm 

387.65 391.26 B: where you might pay an extremely 

391.49 394.35 B: low rent compared to what you would in the city 

394.12 395.78 A: right yeah 

394.58 401.80 B: you know so i guess things kinda balance out that way but when i you know i think looking at five fifteen an hour 

397.73 398.72 A: yeah 

402.78 407.40 B: i would think that's that's actually lowering the minimum wage 

409.29 411.25 B: a- as what it is now 

411.25 413.67 A: (( yeah yes see i don't )) 

412.42 413.46 B: it's either 

414.09 415.05 B: i'm sorry 

414.98 417.68 A: no i don't know yeah i don't know what it is actually 

416.72 419.68 B: it's either five sixty five or five eighty five 

419.59 425.79 A: oh so then what they're proposing in this thing is like a that's a terrible idea [laughter] 

424.08 426.04 B: right is a cut 

425.95 431.57 A: yeah yeah no it definitely should not uh go down because uh 

431.68 445.00 A: people uh i mean even you know even even anybody can't uh i mean it's kind of like there's something sort of uh there's something sort of wrong about it when it's like there's a law that you have a minimum wage but if you even if you were working full time you'd still be 

445.07 451.02 A: you know under the poverty line like you'd still probably qualify for you know for some assistance and stuff if you're making 

450.86 462.05 A: if you're bringing home like two hundred dollars a week you know most places you're gonna well maybe not quite but you'd almost you know you pretty much almost qualify for food stamps with that um you know or some like 

460.84 462.82 B: well i'm sure you would 

462.56 466.54 A: yeah if you had a family for sure yeah 

463.28 464.44 B: i i mean 

464.83 465.77 B: right 

466.55 472.70 A: so that's kinda ridiculous if you're you know if you're working full time and you still qualify for government assistance then there's something wrong with uh 

472.96 475.32 A: (( the minimum wage i think )) 

474.79 477.58 B: right and that's not doing the state any favor either 

477.39 478.22 A: no 

478.51 492.54 A: yeah in the end it winds up uh you know i think it seems like you know people employers like you know they get off so easy not having to uh provide benefits for people and and all that other kind of stuff but uh you know just paying them a little bit more seems uh 

493.64 506.56 A: hm doesn't seem unreasonable but i i mean a lot of jobs like they they just they offer a little bit more than minimum wage starting like it's it's certain kinds of jobs where you just where you only just get minimum wage nowadays i guess 

505.97 509.84 B: right i think it's mostly like fast food places and um 

510.31 513.35 B: i know back in nineteen eighty four 

513.47 519.72 B: no i'm sorry nineteen eighty one i started waitressing making two dollars and a penny an hour 

517.05 518.00 A: mhm 

519.70 520.73 A: right 

520.15 523.23 B: that was the minimum wage for a waitress or a waiter 

522.97 530.28 A: right 'cause they have a different one that uh yeah i know my my girlfriend's a waitress and she gets it's actually not even much more than that now i think she gets like 

529.26 533.56 B: it's two ten it's gone up nine cents since ninety eight one 

531.97 533.31 A: [laughter] yeah i 

533.32 537.40 A: i think she brings home yeah something like i think she gets like two sixty five an hour 

537.54 538.93 A: and uh 

537.67 539.61 B: uh yeah and you're in california 

539.25 543.08 A: yeah i think that's you know maybe that's the minimum here and they um 

543.35 551.69 A: yeah i mean it's just like nothing you know that you're just depending on your tips but there's times when she's on the clock at you know like i just dropped her off at work now you know and so she's got 

551.85 554.81 A: you know she's just doing set ups and and stuff or 

553.55 555.68 B: cleaning and set up exactly 

554.85 561.04 A: yeah and and that's all the money she's gonna make for that that time so it's uh but that's like uh 

558.41 559.44 B: right 

561.48 564.26 A: that's really crazy that much [laughter] 

562.67 567.34 B: i think as far as minimum wage goes all around they need to raise it 

567.14 571.28 A: (( yeah yeah i agree i think that uh i think they should )) 

569.14 570.57 B: quite a bit 

571.42 573.11 A: it seems like um 

574.42 580.35 A: [lipsmack] you know i i guess the i th- i'm trying to think of like what they say about it 'cause i do i read about it now and then and then 

580.26 589.44 A: you know i think they're kinda things that they say against doing it is like that you know people that's it all you know i don't sort of there won't be as many jobs created 'cause employers won't be able to 

590.02 592.24 A: they wouldn't be able to um 

593.33 597.02 A: you know pay as many people so there'd be like less jobs 'cause they don't wanna 

597.16 599.89 A: they wouldn't wanna you know if they have to pay more then they're just gonna employ
