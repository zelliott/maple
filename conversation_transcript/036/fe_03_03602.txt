0.20 2.62 B: hi my name's beverley from pittsburgh 

3.12 4.94 A: uh this is andrew 

6.78 15.79 B: um how do you feel about the minimum wage at five fifteen i personally i don't know how anybody can live on it it's fine for a teenage kid in school but what about an adult 

17.40 18.64 A: (( uh )) 

18.71 21.82 A: [noise] doesn't really matter for the little [noise] 

22.54 25.41 A: since they don't get paid minimum wage 

26.81 35.36 B: okay but what about somebody entering the workforce say uh somebody that's been out of it for a while raising kids the kids are in school you go back to work 

36.02 38.47 B: a job's only gonna be five fifteen an hour 

39.54 41.50 B: how are you expected to live on that 

39.71 40.91 A: w- 

43.15 47.11 A: well then i guess minimum wage is insufficient 

47.55 50.41 A: then that's how the world works 

56.85 58.87 B: okay you've gotta say a little more 

59.58 61.42 A: (( well um )) 

62.20 62.94 A: (( there's )) 

63.74 73.27 A: well that's how not not everything's safe for everyone but then that's why you work for good education everything else 

76.13 84.18 B: okay what about some people that don't have the opportunity or haven't had the opportunity and even though you do have any education you've got to get a job 

84.69 88.16 B: you know some of them still don't wanna pay anything more than minimum wage 

89.37 103.01 A: well there's economic consequences for having a high minimum wage such as inflation so not raising minimum wage would not cause any difference [noise] 

104.30 105.34 B: how so 

106.86 115.98 A: well raising minimum wage will [sigh] might even cause inflation but you know not really depend the like 

116.57 124.97 A: every workforce will go that one place that has a higher minimum wage [noise] but then you know just so 

125.11 127.36 A: those consequences 

127.42 129.08 B: well what are the consequences 

130.57 137.45 A: like i said kinda inflation and um [sigh] [lipsmack] 

138.25 140.08 A: and if 

140.30 150.77 A: if only one area has uh higher minimum wage then the whole area will be flooded with the labor force market leaving other places behind 

152.95 156.07 B: okay but regardless there's inflation everywhere 

156.40 159.70 B: but the thing is is the paychecks don't go along with that 

161.66 165.00 B: hell i mean it's been at five fifteen for how long 

161.94 163.62 A: well 

165.76 166.70 B: too long [noise] 

167.81 181.95 A: well i guess so it's so we yeah if if the minimum wage is raised to that to that point to where it's to stabilize what inflation has caused then i guess that's right but 

182.51 184.72 A: other than that 

196.43 203.78 B: mm well they've gotta do something to come up with it because in in our world today there's no way anybody can survive on five fifteen nowhere 

204.80 206.66 B: it should be at least six 

207.31 210.31 B: like i said if you're a high school kid in school that's fine 

210.51 214.91 B: but when you're living to support yourself paying rent bills and everything else 

214.96 219.84 B: everything else is going up nothing is staying down nothing has gone down as a matter of fact 

220.93 222.24 B: food has gone up 

222.58 226.40 B: gas electric phone cable 

227.17 229.77 B: car insurance gas for the car i 

230.50 233.33 B: mean how are people actually supposed to survive on this 

233.95 237.48 B: cost of living is on a continuous rise and has been 

241.07 242.74 A: well um [sigh] 

243.42 245.13 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

245.20 248.36 A: like i said it's the constant 

248.57 250.72 A: constancy for that [noise] 

254.02 255.41 B: (( [noise] i don't know i'm )) 

265.42 267.61 B: trying to think what else to say on the subject 

267.63 268.56 B: um 

274.51 278.64 B: now most of the w- minimum wage jobs you have don't even come with benefits 

280.27 286.58 B: so there are some people then that would have to pay for health insurance on their own how are they supposed to afford that on minimum wage 

288.78 290.51 A: (( well [sigh] )) 

292.32 295.30 A: that's how the world works you know 

295.60 299.93 A: not the government trying to fight everything you sh- 

299.99 304.93 A: like like other countries like japan they don't even have unions so 

305.22 314.58 A: the quality of the whole economy goes up everything everything goes up standard of living [noise] but then i guess 

314.71 325.93 A: personally if you're the one who's uh mis- misfortunes in that in that um yeah if you're in that situation then 

326.79 328.15 A: and you know 

328.34 329.79 A: that's 

330.23 332.11 A: that's how you have to live 

332.69 337.14 B: how are you supposed to live though you can't afford to pay your bills what are you supposed to do 

339.09 344.65 A: [noise] well some things aren't necessary like you said like cable bills 

344.70 347.22 A: gas bills all that stuff is 

346.58 350.77 B: gas you need gas to heat the house you need gas to cook with 

350.96 352.84 B: gas to heat the hot water 

353.56 356.56 A: okay yeah then 

357.54 361.57 A: you're not always gonna have minimum wage that's just 'til you 

362.03 363.85 A: find a better job 

365.95 369.84 B: and what if there's not a better job around the corner what are you supposed to do 

372.33 378.27 A: then that's if that's the economy you're in then yeah that's what you're faced with 

380.81 390.54 B: okay yet congress doesn't want to raise the pay minimum wage too much but yet they keep giving themself pay raise so they have these wonderful well paying jobs 

392.07 393.49 B: is that fair 

392.42 396.04 A: (( yeah that's totally unfair )) 

396.45 397.95 B: [laughter] right and they don't 

398.16 409.32 B: give a second thought to the average joe public out there and then they wanna know why so many people have to go down to the welfare system and apply for aid because they can't survive on five fifteen an hour 

409.38 415.06 B: and then you have employers that don't wanna shell out the money either they wanna pay the bare minimum that they have to 

415.91 419.22 B: because the more money they have to pay out the less of a profit they make 

419.82 421.43 A: well there's uh 

421.68 436.15 A: republican democrat thing right you wanna cut the government off more you want us to like make the government smaller or do you want more government to help them like have them pay for your ass 

437.62 442.63 B: put it this way i'd rather have a better government that actually cares for the people instead of their own pockets 

443.36 449.01 B: and the first thing we need to do is get the republican outta there ever since he's been in the economy's gone down 

450.04 452.32 B: there was the same thing when his father was in 

453.35 457.89 B: and a matter of fact it was a democrat in the office that actually raised her minimum wage 

453.74 454.50 A: (( th- )) 

458.79 460.54 B: which was really pitiful 

461.53 462.37 A: well 

462.71 467.59 A: the only time that our our economy was well was regan 

467.60 469.22 A: reganomics 

469.29 474.25 B: mm actually no our economy was quite well with clinton in believe it or not 

469.54 470.58 A: where 

474.20 474.89 A: well 

475.14 477.67 A: there there are other 

477.82 481.31 A: you know forces defining economy 

481.63 482.82 B: [noise] such as [laughter] 

484.41 486.68 A: (( [sigh] )) 

486.85 489.77 A: such as wars such as 

490.29 494.30 A: [noise] such as uh what what parties that came through that 

494.36 496.38 A: when they're in office 

497.65 499.38 A: (( um [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

504.13 507.36 A: uh they're not coming to me right now [laughter] 

510.12 511.90 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

512.40 514.78 B: right but wait a minute when bush got in 

514.81 517.24 B: before we had the war and everything 

517.81 522.84 B: it was just like a month or so after he got in everything started changing and going down 

522.86 534.62 B: j- well when he came up with that big oh everybody's gonna get that extra money back on their income taxes all it was was an advance for your next year's taxes it wasn't any extra money anybody got back mhm 

536.42 548.66 A: well yeah that was a political technique you know to um get the votes [noise] but then like yeah that's that's not a real thing 

549.04 555.03 A: to cut government th- that was like that was just a political thing 

555.25 558.10 A: [noise] so like if they if

569.35 570.36 A: then 

570.50 581.60 A: our our society would still survive our economy will still survive and less less will go to the to the congress as you you would like 

583.40 591.65 B: well seriously i mean they give themselves big pay raises the economy's in deplorable conditions and they're giving themselves more money more benefits
