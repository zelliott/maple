0.43 1.59 A: hello 

1.10 2.40 B: hello 

1.90 3.82 A: hi my name is liz 

3.17 5.20 B: hi liz my name is michelle 

4.53 6.81 A: hi michelle um 

7.14 10.71 A: well do you agree with that [laughter] with the minimum wage thing 

10.31 14.38 B: [laughter] um i think it needs to be higher to be honest [laughter] [laughter] 

13.60 19.62 A: me too [laughter] i don't see how anybody can live making that kind of money 

18.99 22.90 B: no especially nowadays when there's um a lot of single parents 

23.08 29.50 B: um there's a lot of people out there that are raising kids on their own i'm not one of 'em but i mean i can only imagine how they're 

29.99 36.02 B: how they can possibly do it if you know if they're only w- if they don't have education or you know they were a stay at home mom 

35.16 36.65 A: (( [noise] right )) 

36.24 41.14 B: and then they go out and try to find some work and they can't get more than five fifteen an hour 

40.59 47.30 A: no it's it's crazy because um you know i'm not in that position as a single parent but i can tell ya i mean 

47.31 55.13 A: y- you know from experience it it's not anywhere i mean even making eight or ten dollars an hour 

55.39 65.73 A: you still i mean the prices of child care are outrageous now in some cases you can get help but if you're right at that line and you can't get help you can't survive 

65.94 66.92 A: (( you know )) 

65.99 67.27 B: exactly 

66.94 69.68 A: that's you know so i think that's way too low 

69.17 76.25 B: well i ha- i have two kids and the babysitter costs five dollars an hour for two kids so how could you do that [laughter] 

70.73 72.10 A: mhm 

72.58 73.61 A: right 

73.71 75.10 A: right well 

75.33 80.91 A: no you can't y- because i- i- it's not worth it for you to work you know i mean i'm well i'm a 

80.93 85.42 A: stay at home mom but i work from my home and i mean 

85.88 90.39 A: my income is only extra so it's not like it's 

90.50 96.26 A: um trust me i could use more but because it's so expensive i i mean where i used to live 

96.50 102.12 A: our um the daycares around there were like two hundred dollars a week 

102.46 108.02 A: so i mean if you're only making minimum wage you can't afford that you know 

106.62 111.74 B: no 'cause it's what is that it's a little over two hundred before taxes i think right yeah 

108.34 117.86 A: ye- yeah so it's it's not worth it so i mean it doesn't give any incentive for people to go out there and work 

117.69 118.91 B: exactly 

118.41 131.10 A: you know i mean even now teenagers yeah you know i mean you've got to start somewhere but they're like whatever you know they're they're they're not going to do that and and it's you know and it seems like nowadays 

130.97 135.55 A: um younger people aren't as motivated as 

135.67 143.67 A: previous generations i guess and they see that and they like go i'm not i can make more from my you know their parents will give them more money than that 

143.18 144.90 B: right oh yeah 

143.68 147.20 A: so why would they go out and work and learn the work ethic 

147.76 148.73 A: you know 

147.89 159.66 B: that's very true and and it it's almost like um [mn] i know like working in an office um a lot of the offices start around like eight dollars an hour for for like clerical or whatever um 

156.50 158.31 A: mhm 

160.11 162.66 B: [lipsmack] and that's even i i don't know i think that 

162.69 168.97 B: depending i don't think office workers should be paid eight dollars an hour i think it needs to start at at least ten [laughter] but um 

166.49 168.49 A: [noise] [noise] right oh definitely 

169.11 173.08 B: i mean to go a lot of like five fifteen an hour you're dealing with the public too 

173.07 179.17 B: which is really hard you know i i waitress part time so i don't even make fifteen an hour 

174.87 176.38 A: mhm 

178.79 180.06 A: right 

179.00 188.40 B: or i mean i don't even make five fifteen an hour i make three seventy five an hour plus my my tips on top of that so i usually average about thirteen dollars an hour but [sigh] to 

180.76 182.63 A: mhm 

184.10 184.99 A: right 

188.26 199.34 B: to be in you know deal with people i don't think i could do that for five fifteen an hour to work in retail or mcdonalds or whatever for five fifteen an hour and deal with the public because it's 

192.56 193.58 A: no 

195.99 197.08 A: mhm 

199.89 203.51 B: not easy at times and i have a high tolerance for it but 

200.52 201.39 A: no 

203.01 216.21 A: [mn] well i i mean i was in the same i mean when i when i was younger i like begged my parents oh please let me work you know now i'm like [mn] god why did i do that [laughter] but a- and i mean i didn't make a lot i just wanted to get out there and learn 

216.17 221.92 A: ah but you know i mean [mn] i- it's just it's just not enough i mean and and 

221.69 234.88 A: they talk about reforming welfare and and you know cutting taxes for and cutting programs for people but how can you cut some of that stuff when that's how they survive i mean trust me i would rather see someone working 

235.01 238.40 A: than on welfare but how can they survive 

238.19 239.20 B: right 

238.61 241.94 A: you know i mean it- it's like a catch twenty two thing 

241.96 244.21 A: because they're just you know they're 

244.37 252.57 A: they're like wow you know i want to go work but i can't survive on five whatever it is an hour you know five fifteen or whatever it was an hour 

252.19 253.10 B: right 

252.69 257.80 A: you know and and i can understand that you know i mean i can you know i- 

257.92 266.33 A: if it's legitimate i can definitely understand that [mn] so i think that it should definitely be way more than that but it's always been 

266.66 270.47 A: it's always been lower than it i think than anyone ever thought it should be 

270.88 281.59 A: [sigh] i mean i think i remember god i'll date myself i guess but like it was like three something an hour [laughter] or something like that i i mean i don't know if that's what it was maybe it was four something 

276.69 278.27 B: wow [laughter] 

281.58 294.94 A: but it's just it really definitely needs to be for people to survive these days and you know if with the economy the way it is every little bit helps and i i think it should definitely be raised and 

291.78 293.19 B: right 

294.71 298.49 B: the sad thing is though too is um the busin- you know if 

298.79 310.13 B: if the businesses have to pay more than the five fifteen an hour it's going to put some businesses out of business you know because they can't they can't afford to pay i know the last time minimum wage had gone up [mn] people were 

303.32 304.41 A: right 

310.27 320.65 B: you know a lot of small businesses were complaining that they were going to have to let people go in order to be able to pay other people the new minimum wage that they couldn't afford it the increase so 

318.33 319.46 A: right 

319.73 320.41 A: hm 

320.43 325.34 A: well i didn't think about that actually um but you know it's um 

325.81 333.76 A: [noise] i mean i guess it's difficult either way y- you know w- whether you're the employee or the employer 

333.59 345.26 B: right and by raising minimum wage too um i think it's affecting like health plans for some of these companies where if they if they're going to have to pay people more wages then they have to cut back on benefits 

334.26 335.27 A: (( you know )) 

344.66 345.76 A: right 

345.44 358.46 B: so um m- my my husband works for the railroad and they have never we've never had to pay for medical insurance and now all of a sudden we have to pay eighty dollars a month for medical insurance which is like twenty bucks a week for a family which is really not a lot 

350.76 352.28 A: mhm 

353.55 354.84 A: wow okay 

357.71 360.88 A: right no not at all actually [laughter] you're lucky [laughter] 

359.61 360.44 B: but 

360.39 365.33 B: yeah [laughter] but i mean we have this you know and this is that's huge the railroad's huge 

365.06 366.39 A: right 

365.14 376.49 B: and if they ha- if they're having enough problems that they have to cut back and and say you know now you guys got to chip in for your insurance you know these smaller companies definitely would because they can barely afford the insurance as it 

375.56 387.78 A: right no a- and i i know from experience because i i went when i worked because i worked in an office i was the supervisor and stuff and i had great benefits but even there i mean it was getting 

387.66 395.51 A: out of hand and i thought that because we were we were up to like fifty or sixty dollars a prescription if it was like a name brand prescription 

394.95 396.48 B: is wow really 

395.45 401.23 A: and but now now that's nothing compared because now we don't have any um insurance 

401.13 415.02 A: so for we have medical but we don't have prescription and the the the prices are outrageous and that's the other thing if these people are only making that much money if they need these prescriptions i i mean they i- it's 

404.37 405.30 B: mhm 

413.89 415.94 B: yeah heaven forbid you get sick 

415.57 417.10 A: yeah you know 

416.13 417.81 B: and have to go see a doctor 

417.48 422.66 A: and at at most of the minimum wage positions they don't offer benefits 

422.10 423.64 B: no mhm 

422.50 435.94 A: so ther- this stuff is coming out of their pocket and again if they have help then that's good but if they're really trying to do it on their own and they don't have that [mn] then you know then it's kind of like they're starting you know maybe they're starting to work their way out of a hole 

436.11 444.68 A: you know by getting a job and and really trying to you know put their best foot forward and stuff and and this could that could be a giant setback to them 

444.57 456.71 B: right and like i was mentioned before the single the single parents um if they you know if they have children and y- your child gets sick and you have to take 'em to the doctor you have a choice of you know should i put food on the table 

444.90 445.91 A: (( you know )) 

448.77 449.89 A: mhm 

456.59 460.45 B: um pay my rent or take my sick kid to the doctor 

459.71 460.76 A: right 

460.52 468.08 B: you know and even i mean even with co-pays we have fifteen dollar co-pays and then we have our medical ah or we have a prescription co-pays as well 

467.47 468.55 A: mhm 

468.20 481.61 B: and you know whenever my kids are sick i'm like oh no an- and sure enough if one gets sick they both get sick so i got thirty dollars in co-pay plus th- whatever medications they go on i hate having to take [laughter] 'em to the doctor i procrastinate myself until i'm i can't take it any more 

472.98 474.31 A: right 

476.73 477.72 A: right 

480.92 489.67 A: right i'm in and i'll always take my daughter [laughter] because i'm like well her i mean and i and i pay a thirty dollar co-pay [noise] plus the prescriptions but then um 

489.71 496.29 A: [lipsmack] with me i'm like i'll just wait [laughter] you know i'll wait 'til i know i'm really really sick before i go because 

492.80 494.00 B: mhm 

494.47 498.91 B: yeah that's what i do too i had a cough for five weeks i finally went in 

496.89 500.95 A: yeah [noise] [laughter] 

499.38 503.85 B: [laughter] and i went in only because i thought i was going to break a rib i was coughing so much 

502.88 509.67 A: [mn] [laughter] what moms do for their kids [laughter] yeah it is [laughter] 

504.69 508.04 B: [laughter] i know isn't it insane 

508.73 516.54 B: an- and they used to give like well visits used to be free well not my insurance i have to pay a co-pay for every well visit that i take my child my baby on 

515.52 518.35 A: (( [noise] oh so do we [laughter] )) 

517.10 529.37 B: yeah it- it's terrible an- and they used to tell me oh you don't owe a co-pay it's a well visit i'm like trust me i owe a co-pay [laughter] so i could just imagine these these single parents and they might have an i- a young infant like that where they're supposed to go in every three months [mn] 

522.01 523.10 A: (( right [noise] )) 

528.34 529.49 A: right 

529.93 537.86 B: and they are not going to want to because they can't afford the shots they can't afford to have these well visits because their their kid isn't sick so now the kids aren't getting their shots 

532.49 533.33 A: no 

537.51 539.36 A: (( right [mn] )) 

537.74 545.75 B: and then you you know it it causes like this big huge repercussion all these waves of different things all because they can't afford to live on five fifteen an hour 

545.02 554.95 A: yep yep it does it's you know [noise] a- and [noise] and it is a- and [noise] i i know [noise] if if you know you're going on a good streak and something bad happens 

554.97 569.03 A: [noise] y- you know you know you know how that makes you feel well these people are in the same boat but it's even more magnified because [noise] at least that's how i feel because th- they're you know they're they're really trying and then something like that happens a- and 

566.88 570.02 B: right it's like a a hit to the ego almost 

569.35 573.49 A: right right and the- and then they give up it's like well then why bother 

573.35 585.76 A: you know i mean not all people but some people will g- say well i know i would do that i'd be like why am i bothering to do this you know why am i trying to better myself and get out of the situation that i'm in because i'm only going to be stuck here anyway 

585.14 586.14 B: right 

586.00 594.65 A: you know so it makes people not it doesn't [noise] it doesn't give people incentive enough i don't think to to go out there and try to do something 

594.43 599.89 B: right try to make something of themselves and um be productive in the in the community or 

596.20 597.39 A: right
