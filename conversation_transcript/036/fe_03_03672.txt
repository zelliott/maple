0.13 1.46 A: (( [noise] hello )) 

1.14 2.79 B: hello 

2.35 4.33 A: hi my name's eileena 

4.46 6.45 B: hi mine's kristen 

6.25 7.75 A: (( nice to meet you [mn] )) 

7.47 9.21 B: nice to meet you too 

8.54 15.97 A: [laughter] over the phone but [laughter] still [laughter] so we're talki- yeah [laughter] so we're supposed to talk about minimum wage 

11.14 12.98 B: [laughter] same difference 

16.01 17.68 B: correct 

16.77 19.73 A: [noise] what did she say it was five fifteen 

19.76 22.73 B: it's the minimum wage is five fifteen right now 

22.34 26.15 A: oh my god that's wo- is that where it's how much it is where you're at 

26.25 31.75 B: yeah it's five fifteen i think it's a federal law to have it at five fifteen [mn] 

30.81 33.22 A: where where where do you live 

33.27 34.66 B: saint louis missouri 

34.61 40.16 A: oh i'm in california los angeles california it's six six fifty out here 

40.25 46.47 B: oh wow well see cost of living up there is much different than i'm near saint louis 

45.87 47.32 A: oh okay 

47.58 48.63 B: but um 

47.65 53.84 A: it's really like high in l._a. but true like ah the cost of living is like much higher over here on the west coast 

53.48 56.37 B: oh yeah your gas prices are much higher than ours 

55.93 58.14 A: what are you guys at for gas right now 

57.82 59.40 B: one twenty six 

59.81 61.32 A: ooh are you kidding me 

61.06 62.52 B: no [laughter] 

61.58 73.72 A: we were at like two something last week we've just dropped down to like a dollar ninety nine it's like between a dollar ninety three and a dollar ninety nine for like the lowest um the unleaded kind 

73.10 75.00 B: mm crazy 

74.28 77.65 A: i know isn't it man i 

76.92 84.07 B: so do you think minimum wage should go up from five fifteen then especially 'cause you guys are at six over there 

83.11 89.18 A: yeah i mean because even at six fifty out here that's not enough it you can't 

89.01 99.32 A: you can't like work on minimum wage at six fifty out here and make it like you have to have at least another job that pays more than that and or it gets you more hours 

97.62 100.99 B: well especially with gas prices and stuff 

100.48 102.55 A: and not only that like it's like 

102.63 112.55 A: the the way that it used to be is every time um you know cost of living expenses went up um milk and bread and eggs you know the basics that um 

112.50 118.17 A: [mn] that minimum wage used to go up as well that's what my grandfather told me anyways so i mean 

118.21 130.32 A: if it almost it costs almost five dollars for a gallon of milk out here all right so how are you going to pay somebody [laughter] five fifteen a hour you know that just doesn't make sense it doesn't it doesn't like balance out 

130.56 133.20 A: i definitely think that they should increase it 

133.56 140.12 B: i see and i don't know i'm kind of the opposite but that's because out here it's like 

140.50 145.21 B: for a gallon of milk you can get it for about two twenty five 

144.69 146.53 A: (( what [laughter] )) 

145.84 159.37 B: yeah so ah i mean get like i said a gallon of gas is like one twenty six and things like that so to for an apartment you can get a two bedroom out here for about five fifty a month 

151.24 152.53 A: mhm 

158.33 162.76 A: oh god that's that's how much you pay to like share a room out here 

162.85 170.21 B: yeah see so i guess that it really depends on your geo- you know your geological location if it should go up or not 

169.66 171.55 A: that's true that's true 

171.34 186.13 B: i think you know like you said it's like m- higher out there you know you can't find a job out there that really pays five fifteen out here a lot of like retail jobs and things like that start you out at five fifty at most 

178.85 179.42 A: (( [mn] )) 

185.65 187.46 A: five fifty you said 

187.11 198.89 B: yeah so i i think it could go up to like five fifty i think that would be good but whenever that goes up everything else goes up so it's a big battle it's like 

199.11 204.18 B: i don't know [laughter] they got to cut taxes or something [laughter] cut spending or 

200.58 203.43 A: yeah that's true that's true 

203.62 212.80 A: that is so true like and it doesn't make sense that i'm in like just because minimum wage goes up that doesn't mean the price of gas and all the rest of that should go up i mean 

212.82 217.36 A: people are already having enough time just trying to pay what it what it was 

217.28 225.26 B: well you would think if minimum wages goes up for a reason because of like the poverty level or whatever controls it 

223.85 225.11 A: yeah 

225.11 232.46 B: so you would think okay if i raise everything else they need also it's not helping 'em out any 

232.64 233.81 A: that's true 

232.98 236.90 B: you know and the more you make the more taxes they take out [laughter] 

235.93 243.36 A: exactly exactly they just keep putting you in a higher and higher brackets and then they- as you get higher and higher in the brackets they take more and more out 

243.46 246.74 B: exactly it's a it's a never ending battle 

246.16 258.68 A: it is because it's not even like really easy to like claim deductions and all that now there's so many like restrictions and limitations on what you can do for tax cutbacks and what not that it's almost like it's just like 

251.30 252.38 B: (( oh no )) 

252.52 253.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

258.95 271.89 A: mm it's just a cycle we're we're gonna they're going to take it out of the pay check and then as soon as it's time for them to take you know time for you to do your taxes and you're going to get it right back but they're just going to take it right back anyway 

272.00 283.53 B: yeah i don't know how minimum wage but everything everything does seem to be based around minimum wage at that level it's like that determines everything 

272.80 273.56 A: [noise] 

284.37 287.83 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah sorry could you hold on just a sec )) 

287.76 288.67 B: sure 

288.46 291.85 A: (( oh nah she hasn't come back yet today )) 

291.98 293.95 A: (( um they're [noise] )) 

296.52 297.35 A: hello 

297.39 298.55 B: yeah 

297.87 300.17 A: okay sorry um 

299.44 300.47 B: (( that's fine )) 

300.65 308.29 A: yeah but wow that's amazing i was always under the impression that that minimum wage was like the same like across the border 

301.14 301.70 B: (( it )) 

308.35 315.23 A: like you know we're at six fifty out here i was thinking like you guys would be at six fifty as well since it's like a federal thing 

315.30 328.43 B: it's i think minimum wage is a f- minimum standard federal you know every every employer has to abide by it except like if it's like a waitressing job and things like that i 

327.97 329.07 A: right 

328.26 331.72 B: think the minimum wage on that's like two fifty 

331.94 344.20 A: that's ridiculous and then because they want to like take their tips and all that i think that's unfair too i don't think that like they should that waitresses and busboys and so on that i don't think that they should be taxed for their tips 

344.51 359.32 B: yeah [mn] m- minimum wage is a funny funny thing especially um say how in one job you can say okay well this job can be you know minimum wage two fifty and this job you know minimum wage five fifteen 

359.27 362.32 B: who says that waitress is going to get tips 

361.80 371.75 A: exactly that's so very true i mean because it all depends on your shift too i mean [noise] if the waitress is working all during the week and she never works on weekends 

371.66 379.91 A: well she's not going to be there at peak times so she's not going to be getting as much of the tips as you know the other person is who does work on the weekends at those peak hours 

379.67 383.57 B: hey very very true [laughter] 

382.79 392.76 A: it's funny like i wonder if they really think about these things i bet they don't because they're sitting up there [laughter] [noise] they probably don't even know what it feels like to have ever had a job with minimum wage salary 

393.14 401.98 B: no they ah most of the top companies you know these people their parents are probably well to do they just probably don't know what money is you know 

400.99 404.64 A: exactly they don't know how to appreciate the value of it probably 

404.53 412.72 B: and the president just like the people who determine mini- minimum wage you know their salaries are in triple digits you know 

412.74 424.12 A: they should they should have to um [laughter] live on the salary that they suggest as the as the medium for um they should have to live on it for a year so that they could truly see what it is i mean 

424.39 430.70 A: it's only fair right if you're going to make laws for these millions and millions of people you should know what it is that you're stipulating them to 

424.49 425.55 B: maybe in 

430.90 437.48 B: right maybe instead of calling it like minimum wage maybe it should be like a medium wage you know 

437.11 438.32 A: there you go 

437.40 446.43 B: something that an average person could live on instead of the absolute destitute level you know i think that's what minimum wage is 

445.86 447.31 A: exactly 

446.81 454.59 B: the destitute level as any lower and the person couldn't survive normal people couldn't survive it should be 

454.60 460.41 B: middle class you know that's what most of us are so let's bring up the standard 

456.04 457.56 A: exactly 

459.68 471.89 A: yep and um in one of my sociology classes we had actually ah had a discussion on minimum wage and ah we had to read this book about this woman who did a study on it and by and she's like this 

472.21 477.37 A: oh man she makes like almost ah like like a good five digits a year 

477.17 478.25 B: (( shoot )) 

477.33 491.49 A: she was yeah she was she was living pretty good and so she wanted to write this book about minimum wage and so her editor was like okay well you go and live the experience so she took the challenge it wasn't even a week into her study and she was already like 

491.84 503.27 A: oh i can't do this but she stuck with it and by the time she finished her book like she truly learned to appreciate the value of her money because even she saw that she had to dip into her savings which you know 

503.05 512.33 A: if she had just been any other ordinary person who had just got that minimum wage job she wouldn't have that savings so like truly she she you know she concluded that 

508.79 510.32 B: right 

512.21 524.04 A: nobody can live on minimum wage not just and and not and that be like your only job your sole source of income because you can't even you can't even pay rent with the [laughter] minimum wage 

524.09 528.98 B: minimum wage if you do not live in a home do not have a car 

529.07 535.17 B: and do not need you know just needed like laundry detergent food things like that 

535.28 538.93 B: then i think you could live off minimum wage but that 

537.74 546.77 A: yeah mayb- yeah maybe then but who lives like that other than high school kids or you know people who still live at home college students or whatever 

538.98 540.65 B: that would be just 

545.66 548.79 B: well high school kids you know they live with their parents 

548.19 554.93 A: yeah that's what i'm saying like nobody yeah nobody has that luxury except for high school students 

549.88 551.91 B: so they don't have to work 

555.59 556.76 B: yeah i 

555.70 562.07 A: and very few college people who who do get to like stay at home and even then like they don't do nothing 

562.61 569.55 B: right college people now these days don't even they have to work on top of college [laughter] 

568.86 573.02 A: yeah and financial aid [laughter] it's almost a joke 

573.20 578.47 B: (( yeah you h- you have to be below minimum wage [laughter] i. e. no pay )) 

576.88 583.16 A: [laughter] yeah and then like it's not like they're not going to pay like the full tuition fees you know 

578.53 579.38 B: [laughter] 

583.08 585.53 B: (( no unless you go to a community college )) 

585.23 587.39 A: ah true true true true 

586.86 594.14 B: and then they will but then they don't you know it never really covers hardly everything 

593.77 594.78 A: uh-uh 

594.17 597.87 B: books because the price of books you know [laughter] 

596.20 599.58 A: [mn] the price of books are atrocious
