86.07 87.84 A: struggling to pay my 

86.20 88.97 B: it's still an out of pocket expense yeah 

88.50 91.63 A: yeah yeah 

90.07 94.13 B: and five dollars an hour that that breaks down to what about forty bucks a day 

94.97 97.75 B: yeah about two hundred dollars a week there's there's no way 

97.61 102.31 A: [noise] yeah and especially if you have more than one kid [noise] i have two 

101.14 102.39 B: (( [laughter] )) 

102.84 109.08 A: and they tend to ah in idaho ah the daycares tend to ch- ah charge more 

109.18 111.45 A: the younger the child is [noise] 

110.93 114.74 B: it's the same way here i don't have kids but my friends do and it's the same way here

118.14 119.90 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

119.79 125.04 B: i i couldn't imagine trying to buy groceries or even pay my light bill on two hundred dollars a week 

120.05 121.11 A: (( yeah )) 

124.72 136.03 A: your rent yeah there's phone yeah all the stuff that comes along with it you know clothes for kids and diapers and

139.94 143.76 A: and i don't know how people do it you know 

140.79 141.60 B: there's 

142.84 145.82 B: i don't either i i really and truly don't 

146.18 153.61 B: i'm i'm single so i kn- i take care of all of my bills and it seems like no matter how many raises you get there's still just never quite enough money 

146.51 147.41 A: and then 

153.52 154.70 A: (( yeah )) 

155.05 156.38 A: yep um 

156.47 157.74 A: it's like ah 

157.78 159.71 A: okay i lost my train of thought 

159.44 161.68 B: [laughter] i'm sorry [laughter] 

160.64 162.82 A: [laughter] no um 

163.18 164.07 A: (( ah )) 

165.39 168.14 A: [mn] like i don't um 

168.17 170.70 A: [noise] with me when i was working 

171.11 172.56 A: yeah even 

172.48 182.17 A: and i wasn't i wasn't getting any type of financial at the time financial help like child support or anything like that for my kids and 

182.04 189.20 A: and then like if you make just like five dollars too much to get food stamps you're screwed 

187.75 189.90 B: you get nothing yeah 

189.30 190.87 A: yeah 

190.25 197.95 B: which makes no sense whatsoever because it's it's like you know it really and truly when with kids especially it doesn't matter how much you make there's always a need 

197.48 199.39 A: [noise] yeah [noise] 

198.01 208.04 B: there's not adequate insurance for medical bills and insurance no matter where you work and and if you have to pay for it out of pocket definitely five dollars and is it twenty five cents an hour now 

208.18 209.32 A: um 

209.32 213.92 B: is it five fifteen or five twenty five it's one of the two but either way it goes that's not enough to matter 

213.27 214.97 A: yeah it's not 

215.80 221.27 B: i there there's i just i could not imagine i have a friend that has a degree that's actually making minimum wage and she is um 

221.17 232.50 B: livid you know you spend sixty seventy thousand dollars on an education and then you get out of school hoping you can use it and the job market is so terrible right now the unemployment rate are just are skyrocketing 

231.50 233.53 A: ridiculous yeah 

233.20 234.84 B: yeah and and it's just 

235.45 241.08 B: nobody wants to work for minimum wage that's what it is there are plenty of minimum wage jobs but you just can't pay your bills 

240.97 242.35 A: nope you can't 

243.26 244.22 A: (( yes )) 

244.60 247.68 A: you can't and and like if like you 

247.69 251.74 A: they want people to get off government assistance 

251.68 253.88 B: but you make more on government assistance 

251.88 252.95 A: but 

253.88 255.81 A: you you can i mean 

256.40 266.74 A: i i'm not looking for work right now i'm i'm a part time student and ah i'm now getting child support and ah for my kids 

266.75 277.37 A: but i w- if i had to go to work i'd be scared that maybe i would find a job but what if i made that five dollars too much and i couldn't get food for my kids 

277.20 282.59 B: right well and and not only that a lot of times government assistance will give you more money 

282.66 296.43 B: over the course of the month when with the the subsidies and and helping housing and whatnot that they'll give you than you could actually make if you're working and doing minimum wage and minimum wage if you're single i think would put you um out of 

290.03 291.05 A: (( yeah )) 

292.42 293.31 A: yeah 

297.37 299.53 B: the bracket that they consider 

299.95 305.72 B: qualifying for for government assistance with children i know it wouldn't but single i think it does 

305.67 306.78 A: yeah 

307.11 310.30 A: i think it does too i know i don't i don't know 

310.66 312.08 A: what i would do 

310.74 311.93 B: i don't either 

312.16 318.53 B: i i i can't imagine um it's it's hard for me to fathom anyone living on that little bit of money 

318.51 319.74 A: yeah 

318.63 322.51 B: and in and considering themselves taken care of 

322.55 324.01 A: exactly 

324.26 327.16 A: yeah there's there's no way 

327.27 328.55 A: and it's 

327.52 328.39 B: (( yeah it )) 

329.69 333.90 A: it it's so not fair that you're working you work and you work and then 

334.42 341.39 A: you know like older people when it's time for them to retire they basically have nothing and they're still struggling 

339.55 340.17 B: (( yeah )) 

341.28 349.77 B: well and you sound young it's scary to think that when we we are working and paying into our social security that when we get old enough to receive it there's not going to be any 

349.47 350.62 A: (( [noise] yep )) 

350.37 355.70 B: um we're working for basically nothing medicare benefits medicare benefits are shot 

352.67 353.83 A: yeah we are 

355.92 356.95 A: (( yep )) 

357.09 360.55 B: (( and and you know if you're making minimum wage how do you afford to pay that i )) 

360.54 362.07 A: exactly 

361.83 365.87 B: mean after uncle sam takes his share you're really and truly bringing home nothing have 

365.75 367.26 A: yeah 

368.01 369.20 A: really 

368.23 379.32 B: you got a have you got a friends really and truly that work about fifteen hours a week and make seven something an hour and they bring home more in in a two week period than you would if you work eighty hours at minimum wage 

379.82 381.03 A: (( wow )) 

381.52 383.03 B: which is kind of scary 

382.75 385.86 A: it is it really is

394.54 395.75 B: i'm not either 

394.80 403.00 A: to say [laughter] good okay and i think you know it's just going to get worse 'cause the longer we have republicans in the office 

403.17 404.36 A: the worse 

404.43 407.79 A: the little people are going to be the common people 

406.14 412.14 B: well i was just fixing to say that you know it might be the big people that put you in office but it's the little people that keep you there 

411.95 413.12 A: (( yep )) 

413.23 415.40 B: and the little people are are 

415.97 418.54 B: are getting the raw end of the stick here 

418.50 419.85 A: they are 

419.86 420.88 B: that m- 

419.89 421.85 A: absolutely [noise] 

421.44 436.00 B: that tax break he gave us the first year in office was so ridiculous when you went to file your taxes the next year and they said oh well the amount that you received as a surplus last year is going to be deducted from the amount you received this year well i didn't ask for it last year why did you give it to me 

436.60 437.85 A: oh wow 

439.36 441.69 A: i didn't i didn't know that part 

439.53 441.02 B: i notice that happened

450.25 452.89 A: oh my gosh 

453.05 456.41 B: that tax cut that bush gave me didn't do a thing 

453.35 454.51 A: (( well )) 

457.94 461.53 A: ah mm and and then what was the point of it 

458.02 459.10 B: nothing 

461.26 466.01 B: exactly i think it was to make us think there was a tax cut 'cause how many people actually pay attention 

466.16 478.37 B: you know they think oops h&r block or or whoever made a little mistake on my taxes and mm i'm just not going to get back two hundred dollars that i thought i was no big deal you know you know i called i was like i want my two hundred bucks where is it 

466.61 467.52 A: it 

474.57 475.75 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

478.36 480.73 A: yeah really 

479.30 482.45 B: i did my taxes i know they're right 

482.79 487.42 B: and they're like oh well you know we gave you that tax break last year and that was really just um 

482.90 483.89 A: (( yeah )) 

487.57 492.98 B: an advance on what you were going to get this year so that it could help you along well that's not a tax cut 

492.97 495.34 A: (( no [laughter] )) 

494.57 497.11 B: that's not a tax cut at all honey that was a joke 

496.92 499.91 A: [noise] yep totally 

498.53 503.15 B: let me let me talk to w. that's what i said to the irs let me talk to w. 

502.06 506.32 A: (( [laughter] [noise] yeah yep )) 

505.44 516.14 B: i just and could you imagine tax time if you were ah if you were making the minimum wage thing there you wouldn't give anything you wouldn't have anything to give and there's definitely not a way you'd get anything back 

509.08 515.04 A: (( [noise] [noise] no [noise] [noise] )) 

516.34 517.99 A: (( yep [noise] ah )) 

519.55 521.36 A: (( you you well )) 

521.53 523.05 A: (( there's there's none )) 

523.15 531.55 A: and it's just you know people criticize ah clinton things were so good there were plenty of jobs 

531.54 544.11 A: during the clinton years he actually tried to to raise the minimum wage which he did but it wasn't enough because the rest the republicans wouldn't let him raise it more it's 

543.20 547.87 B: well now if they want to talk about raising the minimum wage we need to talk about a couple of dollars here 

547.51 558.23 A: yeah and every time it's brought up the ah the businesses and thing peop- say well we're just going to have to raise our prices on our merchandise 

558.25 563.28 B: which is it's bogus anyway you're already marking things up three hundred percent in a retail store 

558.58 560.03 A: (( you know it's just )) 

563.17 565.37 A: you are yeah 

564.31 567.87 B: i mean if you get it for two i'm paying ten for it easily 

567.86 568.94 A: yep 

568.99 572.68 B: and i didn't realise just how big the mark up was i have a friend that actually 

572.59 586.21 B: owns a clothing store in the mall and you know when it's your friend you get it at cost and i'll go in and i'll be like gosh i really want this what'll you give it to me for and he's like oh you can have it for twenty five then i get home and i look at the ticket and it's like got a hundred and twenty five dollar price tax on it i'm like 

586.34 588.71 B: no way you're not charging that for this 

586.58 587.72 A: [noise] 

588.99 591.16 A: oh my gosh [laughter] 

590.70 594.87 B: yeah i mean you just you don't realise unless you have someone that will give it to you 

594.72 596.19 A: (( yeah ))
