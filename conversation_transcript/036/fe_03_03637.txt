0.48 2.62 A: hi i'm beverley 

2.01 4.58 B: hello i'm simon 

4.47 5.90 A: it's nice to meet you 

6.43 7.51 A: um 

7.67 10.56 A: minimum wage up to five something an hour 

10.51 19.77 B: uh-huh five fifteen i believe uh i didn't really catch the amount but uh basically it's an increase of minimum wage right 

19.76 21.28 A: yeah 

21.02 29.12 B: um [lipsmack] i mean my opinion yes there should be i mean in this economy of unemployment i believe uh 

29.67 35.95 B: if there is a little more security of having a high minimum wage that definitely would be helpful 

36.18 38.60 A: yeah but is it enough to live on 

38.95 44.34 A: i mean in california up in washington where i lived it would be enough to live on 

44.45 47.93 A: kind of but here in california 

48.75 52.09 A: in san jose there's no way you could survive 

51.87 53.46 B: on that wage 

52.19 54.31 A: on yeah 

54.39 55.49 A: i mean 

54.39 57.90 B: uh do you know what the state limit in california 

57.86 59.85 A: [sigh] no i don't 

59.53 71.19 B: okay but i don't believe that it's higher um because expenses are higher in california is it it's kind of uniform standard throughout the country right 

66.41 67.95 A: yeah 

70.72 76.24 A: well i know californian uh washington the minimum wage is six dollars an hour 

75.80 77.66 B: mhm 

77.56 81.31 A: and so to go to five something that would actually be going down 

81.65 88.01 B: mm [laughter] okay i believe uh the objective here is an increase i mean in a 

87.08 89.40 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

88.34 94.54 B: so uh i guess they're assuming that you know the minimum wage is below um 

94.54 103.39 B: five point one five or the figure that they mentioned i believe they just assuming that the figure is below that and you know we want to increase it 

103.03 108.75 A: i think it should be i mean a lot of the minimum wage jobs out there are 

103.41 104.20 B: so 

109.17 110.57 A: you know the 

110.87 116.51 B: like do you see a drawback in increasing like the minimum wage 

116.86 119.16 B: do you see if affecting somebody 

117.09 118.52 A: the small bus- 

118.84 121.56 A: the small business would have trouble with it 

121.68 125.54 A: the you know the mom and pop grocery store that has to hire 

125.38 127.19 B: mhm 

126.07 128.95 A: you know someone and they don't get enough business 

128.33 129.47 B: right 

129.63 133.61 A: um the other person that would have 

133.87 139.97 A: i don't know i think it would help people that don't have a very high education level 

140.15 145.21 A: so they'd be able to provide a little bit better maybe for their families 

144.97 146.91 B: that's right it'll help them better 

146.83 147.98 A: yeah 

147.05 150.95 B: but uh at the cost of the small business or so you said 

150.55 152.11 A: yeah 

152.22 154.36 A: (( and )) 

154.41 155.59 A: um 

156.64 162.26 A: gosh the only real negative i think would be that the business owner would lose a little bit more money 

162.88 175.27 B: right right it's not really gonna affect any of the big businesses because the minimum wage really is not um you know a criteria for most of the white collar jobs basically it would be for the blue collar jobs right 

175.05 176.52 A: right 

177.60 179.62 A: (( and )) 

179.09 187.06 B: i don't know i mean in this economy um the there has been basically a lot of you know reforms suggested to 

187.32 188.41 B: um 

188.30 193.93 B: you know decrease unemployment and one if we increase the minimum wage 

193.81 205.56 B: there could be a possibility that there might be even more people getting unemployed because of businesses cannot afford to pay the minimum wage so would that increase unemployment [laughter] i don't know i'm just speculating 

201.58 202.93 A: that's true 

204.82 210.02 A: [laughter] no but that's true you know how many 

205.73 207.69 B: [laughter] um 

210.15 214.91 A: businesses would say well i can only afford three employees so 

213.72 222.15 B: exactly instead of four or five so you know more people might get laid off and effectively what you said like you know they can provide 

215.46 216.52 A: yeah 

222.12 229.15 B: better for their families they might even lose their jobs because the high minimum wage is so it's like a double edge sword 

226.49 227.82 A: yeah 

229.39 234.44 B: um you can't raise it too high but you can't bring it down too low 

234.91 235.87 B: um 

235.03 239.80 A: i remember growing up it was like three thirty five an hour 

239.46 241.29 B: oh really [laughter] okay 

240.61 243.17 A: yeah [laughter] 

242.38 244.23 B: okay i mean i was 

243.23 247.35 A: my first job [laughter] 

245.03 250.11 B: okay [laughter] you started off at like mcdonald's or something like that 

249.41 252.00 A: it was a chinese restaurant yeah 

250.97 252.59 B: [laughter] okay 

252.62 254.76 B: th- that's interesting i mean it's 

254.85 260.96 B: in a way it's good that you work your way from the bottom you know like so that you know the value of money [laughter] you know 

260.47 261.94 A: yeah 

261.28 271.14 B: uh something like that i mean i was kind of getting the same uh when i was a student i just you know completed my masters when i was a grad student you know getting the minimum wages in ohio 

271.01 272.44 A: yeah 

271.52 278.44 B: so uh that but that was like five point one five something it was the same thing it's just about two years ago 

272.79 274.03 A: you know a- 

278.28 284.85 A: yeah but like in wisconsin waitresses they don't even make minimum wage 

284.87 287.91 B: is it is that legal if they don't make minimum wage 

287.40 294.22 A: the way they do it is um because they count their average tips per hour 

293.97 295.00 B: mhm 

294.39 298.63 A: and the average with the tips equals minimum wage 

298.44 302.83 B: so the tips is included in the in the wage in the salary 

301.78 303.30 A: yeah 

303.07 307.19 B: i didn't think it wou- it would have been because how do you account for tips 

307.34 308.17 B: like 

307.41 308.69 A: i don't know 

308.54 310.67 B: they have to declare it right 

308.86 309.84 A: but 

310.06 318.38 A: yeah you have to declare it but in wisconsin waitresses can be hired at like two dollars two fifty an hour 

318.50 319.66 B: and that's legal 

319.54 320.92 A: and that's legal 

322.10 323.01 B: (( hm )) 

323.31 327.84 A: and i couldn't i was shocked 'cause i was going to apply for a job as a waitress 

323.33 324.29 B: okay 

327.25 329.01 B: mhm [laughter] okay 

328.57 337.19 A: and i was absolutely shocked that you know 'cause i was thinking oh i'll get my minimum wage and then i'll get my tips on top of that 

335.23 345.38 B: close to yeah but that's why i was always thinking because you know the tip is something that not everybody leaves you know some people leave more some people leave less some people don't leave any 

344.10 345.14 A: (( yes )) 

345.29 353.68 B: so it's it's something that cannot be relied upon and i believe that shouldn't be counted [laughter] in the wages 

352.44 353.49 A: yeah 

353.81 358.99 A: i agree you know so i guess depending on where you're at in the country depends on 

359.35 365.93 B: so you believe this is only in that state like it's not uh it's not universal for all the waitresses in the u._s. 

362.09 363.47 A: yeah 

365.91 373.17 A: no i think it's just wisconsin i know washington the waitresses in washington get um minimum wage 

373.48 375.67 A: or usually get minimum wage 

375.24 376.33 B: okay 

376.92 380.75 A: and i think here in san jose i think they 

381.79 385.71 A: i really didn't apply for a job w- j- as a waitress so i don't know 

385.37 386.43 B: okay 

386.74 387.97 B: but um 

388.42 394.04 B: as you said before the expenses are high in california right so uh it really 

391.61 392.60 A: yeah 

394.11 403.03 B: i don't know how i i've never been to the west because i'm like i stay in boston so it's you know i've been only in the eastern side of the united states and uh 

399.00 399.95 A: uh-huh 

404.05 410.88 B: uh it is expensive like new york and you know all the big cities d._c. and new york boston but 

408.47 409.48 A: yeah 

410.85 421.04 B: um i've never really co- i mean compared you know the wages to california i heard it it is supposed to be the highest in the country right i mean the expenses 

420.69 424.09 A: it's one of the highest i think um 

424.28 427.27 A: i think hawaii's actually the highest 

426.83 434.49 B: okay so but hawaii still falls under the same wage uh minimum wage re- uh laws 

434.48 435.39 A: uh-huh 

434.81 439.20 B: i would think so right i mean because i mean it should be the same all the way u._s. 

436.19 437.66 A: yeah 

440.51 442.19 A: yeah it um 

443.06 446.13 A: [lipsmack] not like some places 

446.30 449.17 A: you know where the cost of living isn't so high i 

448.79 450.10 B: mhm 

449.71 453.01 A: don't know maybe [sigh] minimum wage 

451.66 457.57 B: it might be yeah it it should be probably different for different states is that what you're suggesting 

455.88 465.47 A: yeah [noise] yeah 'cause like in california you know for a three bedroom house with a two gar car garage in order to rent it 

464.87 466.17 B: mhm 

465.57 468.53 A: you'd pay about two thousand dollars a month 

468.02 469.54 B: right okay 

468.90 473.13 A: and that's for um you know the type of place that i live in 

473.21 479.44 A: go up to washington the same type of place might cost around a thousand to twelve hundred 

477.84 478.90 B: okay 

479.06 480.31 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

480.07 484.87 A: so you know that right there is just a huge difference between the two 

483.48 484.39 B: right 

485.16 488.54 A: [noise] and there's you know the other things too 

488.65 495.38 A: like how much the you know price of food is and whether or not the insurance is higher and 

491.91 493.62 B: mhm 

495.06 497.98 B: that's true that's right i wonder why 

495.40 496.40 A: (( you know )) 

496.70 497.53 A: and 

497.91 510.27 B: i mean they haven't i mean they haven't made any you know state wise differentiation for minimum wages they probably have to be a good reason why they've not done that i don't know [laughter] 

504.81 506.02 A: yeah 

509.59 518.04 A: well in you know it's like your gas i don't know how much your gas costs out there on the east coast but to buy gas for your car here 

518.26 521.70 A: uh right now it's at about a dollar eighty a gallon 

521.34 523.77 B: that's for the eighty seven grade 

524.00 526.43 A: yeah just the the lower grade 

525.80 536.15 B: the lower grade yeah the lower grade is uh i just pumped gas today that is something like one sixty nine so it's yeah it's about ten or fifteen cents uh different between 

531.08 532.10 A: yeah 

535.21 541.04 A: and so it doesn't make sense that minimum wage would be the same all the way across the country 

541.05 546.06 A: if the cost of living is so drastically different all the way across the country 

544.39 548.06 B: exactly i agree i agree that makes sense 

548.32 555.05 B: uh you know especially most of the states like ohio where i studied i mean that's the cost of living is extremely low 

554.90 556.08 A: yeah 

555.32 558.64 B: so uh you can actually afford to live on minimum wages 

558.67 560.73 A: [laughter] 

559.71 567.38 B: [laughter] i did i mean when i was a student and i was getting mi- minimum wages you know on campus uh i i was living pretty comfortably 

567.31 571.50 A: cool i know where i wanna move [laughter] 

567.95 568.84 B: yeah 

569.15 576.23 B: [laughter] but then it's middle of nowhere you know and like the countryside and you know you don't have the city um 

573.85 575.09 A: that's true 

576.79 584.78 B: s- uh it depends like you're near san francisco right i mean that's that's a big city you can get a lot of stuff there and 

584.22 590.61 A: oh yes i mean here in santa clare county i think there's just over a million people 

584.94 585.92 B: uh 

589.86 591.46 B: [laughter] okay 

591.30 593.40 A: you know and i'm sitting there 

593.53 597.75 A: i'm going okay that's a little bit of you know a few people 

597.32 598.83 B: right [laughter] 

598.78 599.89 A: (( and it's kinda interes- ))
