0.00 1.58 B: hi my name is delton 

1.61 3.55 A: hi i'm dan 

3.41 4.43 B: okay 

4.38 10.76 A: and i'm speaking from uh kensington maryland which is near washington d._c. 

10.28 13.73 B: okay dan i'm calling from philadelphia pennsylvania 

13.43 16.34 A: good grief a little north of here 

15.75 16.88 B: yes 

16.79 19.08 A: okay you wanna start 

18.51 25.65 B: yeah the topic is is pretty good i think they should increase the the wage a little bit 

25.75 30.16 B: but it's pretty good though you know it gives a chance for people to make decent wages 

31.37 36.41 A: well you i think the question was whether they should uh 

37.08 44.75 A: raise it uh beyond uh what the pr- raise is i think she said five fifteen 

44.40 46.32 B: yeah 

45.33 46.82 A: and uh 

46.94 48.96 A: i think that [laughter] 

49.05 51.84 A: that sort of minimum uh 

52.00 57.36 A: kind of doesn't exist in our market because uh 

57.40 59.82 A: nobody will work for that little 

59.41 71.96 B: no no one's gonna be working for five fifteen because they think that's an insult but there would have to be a congress' decision to to raise that because the way the economy is and things of that nature 

71.85 74.51 B: you know that has to be taken into consideration 

74.72 84.76 A: yeah i be- i been around long enough to remember the w- minimum wage going from fifty cents an hour to sixty cents an hour so uh 

83.37 84.38 B: okay 

85.21 95.32 A: but uh [laughter] yeah i i uh i see what you mean about it being congress' decision on on u- ultimately though 

94.86 95.49 B: (( good )) 

95.35 99.51 A: it's up to us to uh tell our congress people 

96.69 98.51 B: (( night )) 

99.99 103.54 A: what we think and i think that's what this call's about 

103.12 114.39 B: well we do that with our votes um i don't think some of the congress men and women they really understand that you know you have to have a decent wage to survive in 

114.63 116.38 B: america today 

115.93 126.96 A: i i think they understand that but i think that they figure that if you can't make it on five fifteen you should uh go out and hold down three jobs 

126.52 127.93 B: (( well )) 

128.06 131.31 B: a- a- five fifteen is a is an insult 

130.88 132.30 A: i agree with you 

131.86 134.66 B: that is an insult that's a slap in the face for any 

135.01 146.98 B: tax paying citizen i mean wh- why would you expect someone to work for that when they can be making more money but a lot of employers unfortunately today low skilled and unskilled 

147.03 149.78 B: people will settle for that 

148.89 160.10 A: yeah but uh uh they it's interesting the the minimum uh also applies to certain categories like sales people and uh 

160.29 172.16 A: uh wait- waiters and waitresses who uh on the books are making the minimum wage but may or may not have that increase by uh 

163.02 165.27 B: (( they do mhm )) 

172.52 173.59 A: um 

173.61 176.01 A: commission or by uh 

176.20 177.35 A: (( uh )) 

177.41 180.69 A: uh tips in the case of the wait people 

180.43 188.07 B: yeah well th- those are the lower skilled people you know those people that's making that and waitressing and waiters 

188.21 191.77 B: and i don't think you know they really have 

191.71 205.48 B: uh a tendency to really feel as though they can go out and get more but they have to understand that education and training will allow you to make decent wages and if you don't get these things you wanna continue to make that lower wage 

204.84 209.30 A: well there's there's another problem and that is that uh 

209.45 210.42 A: uh 

210.60 212.06 A: if people 

212.40 225.39 A: can't live right or you know live at some minimum standard uh it's gonna be uh very difficult for all of us uh a- an example might be uh 

225.29 228.81 A: people who uh who don't seek 

229.00 241.02 A: uh health treatment because they can't afford it and end up uh spreading what's uh at best maybe a bad cold around but it could be something else 

233.02 233.98 B: (( mhm okay )) 

239.38 247.03 B: well it's it's kinda hard to to get that when these h._m._o.s are are geared toward people with 

248.24 250.79 B: you know with big money 

248.95 249.72 A: with 

250.18 256.50 A: yeah yeah with with jobs and usually good jobs i i agree with you on that 

254.43 255.37 B: (( i know )) 

256.27 258.98 B: [noise] or they you know so it's about that 

260.24 263.21 A: by golly you're dispatching people 

261.46 264.04 B: [noise] affirmative yeah 

265.48 268.98 B: [noise] affirmative yeah you are right 

269.40 271.26 A: [laughter] 

270.33 275.76 B: [noise] [noise] i'm i'm at work he came back and he went back up go ahead i'm listening 

272.52 273.60 A: yeah the s- 

275.41 283.49 A: this is this is almost as good as uh a a scanner uh yeah i know you are uh 

281.99 283.17 B: [laughter] 

283.78 287.62 A: no i i very definitely agree with you i um 

286.39 287.40 B: y- 

287.76 291.96 A: uh i'm one uh i think one of a last dying 

292.15 293.68 A: uh 

293.98 296.94 A: out and out liberals and um 

296.81 300.54 B: so you believe in rush lumbar's theory on things 

300.84 304.01 A: not rush lumbar's theory no way 

303.44 304.99 B: oh okay 

304.04 305.35 A: (( i uh )) 

306.71 310.96 A: my feeling is that uh [laughter] you have to 

311.79 314.22 A: go beyond a uh 

314.31 319.20 A: uh a livable minimum you have to uh 

319.51 326.50 A: have a a um i guess the word is a just minimum you have to give enough 

326.57 331.65 A: as a min- minimum wage and find a way to run your business 

331.30 332.54 B: that's right 

331.90 336.50 A: uh based on it uh so that your people can 

336.61 341.93 A: uh live decently actually strangely enough one of the first people who 

342.39 346.27 A: recognized this was uh henry ford who uh 

345.19 349.51 B: [noise] yeah he was a good capitalist 

348.43 349.29 A: yeah 

349.71 356.14 A: and uh yeah that was a problem but as a capitalist he was good uh 

349.74 350.55 B: and uh 

356.52 359.52 A: and uh it 

359.69 362.95 A: it makes sense to me but um 

363.76 368.31 B: you're right you know we all want to live well we all want to have a decent wage 

367.66 376.03 A: i'm not i'm not even talking about living well i'm talking about having enough to eat and having medical attention available and uh 

375.12 379.45 B: well you can't get that if you're just making five fifteen [laughter] 

378.42 385.28 A: absolutely i think it should be more than that but uh [sigh] 

382.24 383.22 B: (( yes )) 

385.07 387.00 B: exactly because 

385.78 389.49 A: the the argument is that it will drag the ec- 

389.59 392.24 A: down on the economy and 

391.82 393.47 B: well in certain areas 

392.60 399.41 A: for- ford's thought on it was that if you gave your workers enough uh 

399.61 404.24 A: uh if you gave them a fair wage they could afford to buy your product 

404.12 410.42 B: yeah well well you know you gotta realize and ask yourself what is a fair wage 

404.73 405.99 A: (( which uh well )) 

410.70 411.57 B: (( so )) 

412.28 419.44 B: what is a fair wage that's what you gotta ask yourself you know we know five fifteen isn't a fair wage 

418.86 420.05 A: no way 

419.71 424.65 B: and um you're not getting how can you know you live off a that it's it's 

424.67 428.91 B: you can't raise a family and much less you know take care a your children with that 

428.05 440.28 A: well the o- the only way you do that is uh if you and your wife are both working several jobs and then of course the the kids suffer because uh you're uh 

440.52 441.65 A: uh 

441.61 442.75 B: mhm 

441.96 444.90 A: their mother isn't home to take care of them 

444.32 446.40 B: mhm 

445.19 446.63 A: (( and um )) 

447.18 449.34 A: yeah it's a mess 

448.76 450.63 B: yeah 

449.42 452.41 A: perhaps uh [laughter] 

451.80 454.83 B: well what is what is the minimum wage there 

454.67 463.50 A: uh it's interesting the minimum wage uh i don't i don't know about the state minimum i'd say it's around the national minimum 

463.17 464.46 B: mhm 

463.47 472.71 A: but uh uh for the hell of it i re- you know i retired and i decided gee when i was a kid i used to do

486.54 487.54 B: okay 

487.37 493.45 A: decided to see whether i still liked that which i don't and uh they 

490.54 491.53 B: you don't 

494.10 502.98 A: uh paid above the minimum in this area because they said you couldn't get by on the minimum wage and it was uh 

503.11 513.74 A: their company policy and so instead of paying i don't know what the minimum is here let's say it was five and a quarter they paid something like five thirty eight 

504.80 505.61 B: (( okay )) 

513.41 514.42 B: okay 

513.93 519.32 A: say which was also an insult but then you add to it with commission 

516.21 517.49 B: right 

519.77 521.56 A: and uh 

522.67 525.73 A: uh i did not grow rich there

540.90 541.99 B: oh 

545.16 547.82 B: i i'm thinking we're getting halfway through it 

547.42 548.38 A: uh 

548.82 549.86 A: so 

550.14 555.18 B: and well do people live well around there on the minimum wage there 

555.42 563.08 A: no i tell you what what i've been noticing around here is there there's a uh a lot of influx

591.14 593.25 B: mhm 

592.02 597.27 A: but uh uh no there's there's no way you can live on the minimum 

596.67 599.37 B: [laughter]
