0.46 2.25 A: hi i'm sally 

1.90 3.52 B: hi i'm rachel 

4.69 10.97 A: yeah um the yeah concerning the the question do you do you honestly feel that it's sufficient m- 

11.32 14.63 B: i actually don't because i know that 

15.01 21.12 B: ten years ago when i was working for minimum wage it was four seventy five so it's not much of an increase in ten years 

21.98 24.48 A: y- yeah that's true i think it's i mean 

24.52 28.94 A: of course there is the rise in the cost of living and like that 

29.19 32.86 A: so i mean that definitely is not sufficient for 

33.59 35.70 A: anyone to get by you know 

35.55 36.76 B: i agree 

36.47 37.83 A: yes i know 

38.09 43.05 A: [mn] pretty much i mean especially if you have kids and stuff like that there's no way 

43.08 43.95 A: you know 

43.16 44.59 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

44.20 52.38 A: it's going to sustain you and a family and you know so the the that i mean it it hampers 

52.70 55.86 A: you know the quality of life you know and um 

56.34 59.61 A: somehow i mean the minimum wage thing is 

60.29 72.50 A: obviously yes you know pretty much they give it to people that are under forty five and stuff like that and don't have too much education i mean those the type of jobs you get but the thing is it's still not sufficient you know and um 

73.20 74.60 A: i somehow 

73.48 79.18 B: yeah i agree i just i is it do you know if it's just that much in 

79.35 81.14 B: in pennsylvania 

81.16 82.23 A: (( i don't know )) 

81.23 82.71 B: like where do you live 

82.74 83.98 A: (( i'm in georgia )) 

84.25 85.74 B: oh you're in georgia 

85.51 86.24 A: hm 

86.22 96.06 B: okay 'cause i'm in pennsylvania and i guess that's a national number 'cause you would think it would also vary depending on where you live because the cost of living is not the same 

90.72 91.41 A: (( uh-huh hm i )) 

93.98 94.88 A: know 

95.92 102.88 A: exactly because i mean like if you're in california that definitely isn't you know [laughter] so i think it's um 

99.38 100.90 B: exactly 

101.85 104.29 B: (( it's a little expensive [laughter] )) 

103.62 108.40 A: i know [laughter] i know but i mean i don't know it's like 

108.65 110.18 A: it it's i mean 

110.46 113.46 A: i don't know it's just that we have to get by and um 

113.68 121.92 A: i i don't think the people that put out these figures understand the ramifications of it or the extent of it obviously they're not looking for that 

122.01 133.22 A: ah minimum wage i'm sure they're not so ah a- i mean it doesn't say it doesn't fall into your backyard you know so i mean so i don't know it it's it's difficult to get by and then i mean do you have any kids 

122.09 122.91 B: right 

127.03 127.88 B: right 

133.26 134.95 B: no i don't have kids 

134.64 136.71 A: (( ah i have four and i i mean )) 

137.62 138.88 A: (( to to )) 

139.03 141.07 A: survive on on that is definitely 

141.48 146.37 B: do you are you do you have a a better paying job or do you live on minimum wage 

146.13 148.74 A: hard minimum wage myself yeah yeah i know 

147.88 148.87 B: yeah 

148.82 153.65 A: so it it's very difficult i mean do you or ah do you have a better paying job 

153.78 159.42 B: no i have i mean i went to college so i was lucky that i was able to go to school and 

156.34 157.22 A: (( mhm mm )) 

159.37 170.77 B: so that definitely helped but i remember even when i was in going through college and then high school working for minimum wage it was hard then before i really had all my bills that i have now 

170.49 175.38 A: mhm oh and i mean i mean i'm in college now but the thing is i mean i during the the 

175.50 180.96 A: (( meantime i have to take the minimum wage so i think it's it is difficult you know and um )) 

179.87 180.68 B: right 

181.34 183.82 A: i don't know i think the the people that 

184.26 187.87 A: come up with these these um figures and stuff really need to 

186.96 190.72 B: they they're rich [laughter] they don't have to worry about minimum wage 

188.52 189.89 A: (( i know and i )) 

190.68 193.03 A: said [laughter] and ah 

191.83 194.32 B: [laughter] they don't live on minimum wage 

194.04 195.67 A: no that's the only thing and um 

196.09 198.87 A: (( i don't i don't have the the the )) 

199.69 202.06 A: (( accounts you know they just practice )) 

203.09 203.86 A: (( ah )) 

204.05 204.98 B: right 

204.24 205.04 A: (( and stuff )) 

207.57 209.84 A: i mean it's the people you 

210.28 212.12 A: you know and um 

211.25 212.57 B: yeah 

212.53 214.16 A: but the thing is um 

214.43 216.50 A: (( i don't know i i still tend to think we )) 

218.96 219.98 A: (( and um )) 

219.12 220.12 B: mhm 

220.55 223.26 A: and i just had ten years for that 

223.32 224.94 A: that small and 

224.34 231.88 B: i mean it was four it was like four twenty five or four seventy five when i worked for it 

231.69 232.59 A: mhm 

231.96 233.17 B: and i mean that was 

233.32 236.70 B: a good ten years' ago it's not like fifteen 

236.40 237.23 A: yes 

236.72 244.08 B: so it it has not increased a a lot at all like maybe seventy five cents tops 

241.17 242.02 A: (( i know )) 

243.74 251.41 A: yes i mean um seventy five cents definitely isn't going to well i mean you probably something but the thing is it's definitely not you know 

251.46 252.74 A: in a in 

251.56 254.43 B: yeah i mean you can't buy anything for seventy five cents 

254.03 255.73 A: (( a i know that's the whole thing )) 

254.47 256.23 B: that's not going to make a difference 

256.03 257.61 A: that's the whole thing and um 

258.40 271.06 A: in eighty seven i attended a college in montana it was like three something then you know and um that that i mean that was ridiculous you know that was really ridiculous i mean right and then always a long time 

263.99 265.28 B: (( mhm )) 

266.50 267.89 B: mhm 

271.03 271.98 B: (( mhm )) 

272.80 274.95 A: that you know and um 

274.18 275.20 B: i know 

275.41 280.29 A: i know i i mean my heart goes out to people that have to 

280.38 284.69 A: live this way i mean i'm going to be out of it soon but i mean there are some people that 

285.12 289.62 A: just will have to be in like that in that situation all their lives i know 

289.76 292.62 A: it's it's really tough on them you know 

291.37 298.93 B: oh i can imagine i couldn't i can't live on what i make now and i make you know more than the minimum wage but it's still hard 

292.90 293.76 A: (( and um )) 

298.78 300.40 A: (( exactly you know i know )) 

300.71 303.47 A: so it's it's a wee bit difficult and um 

303.49 304.64 A: (( i don't know i )) 

304.95 313.71 A: i think there needs to be new legislation on this and i don't know there's someone out there for the cause and i mean and thing is i mean there's enough 

314.00 317.95 A: so the thing is the it's the people that needs to hear 

317.96 319.46 A: you're not paying attention i 

319.38 320.20 B: right 

319.62 322.04 A: think you know and um 

322.67 324.93 A: (( i don't know i don't know i don't know )) 

325.02 328.30 A: how it's going to be i mean things are obviously 

328.43 333.49 A: since the war and all that things are different now and the job losses um cuts and all that 

332.85 334.93 B: right it's hard now 

333.51 334.35 A: (( i know )) 

334.51 336.44 A: exactly and um 

336.95 338.12 A: (( i don't know is )) 

337.08 342.05 B: so that's why they can probably afford to keep the minimum wage low because people are 

342.47 345.49 B: just happy to have a job whatever it is 

345.11 346.78 A: (( it i know the the thing )) 

345.67 347.58 B: no matter how much it pays 

347.46 358.45 A: yeah that's true you know but i think it's it's like then you know i think if you have an attitude it's like you know it's be- it's going to keep them happy and you know so let's just just 

356.42 357.41 B: (( mhm )) 

358.55 366.02 A: do what you know is more beneficial to the country and the whole of us i think it's like you then in my mind it's like they don't really care 

360.86 362.07 B: (( mhm )) 

366.12 366.98 B: uh-huh 

366.44 368.05 A: you know about 

368.39 369.99 A: (( people having a a )) 

370.01 376.14 A: better quality of life and stuff like that and you know being able to really take care of themselves and they have to have um 

376.55 377.90 A: help you know 

377.92 379.23 B: no i agree 

378.91 382.02 A: there's welfare and all that so it's like i don't know it's um 

382.75 391.42 A: i don't know i i just think that m- more needs to be done you know in terms of this and looked into it and and not just look and talk but 

391.43 405.71 A: you know have more action and and really give peop- people what they would because the thing is people that work for a minimum wage i mean it's like they're laborers and stuff like that and i mean but the thing is it's hard work it's not like they're sitting down and just collect 

392.30 393.16 B: (( mhm )) 

404.65 405.88 B: i know 

405.87 420.56 A: you're actually doing hard work you know and um if someone would say that alright if you're going to move tonnes of bricks i'm definitely getting started on this but and the elderly people are going to have and all that it's like you know 

408.28 409.31 B: mhm 

420.48 421.37 B: right 

420.65 421.87 A: the thing is 

422.04 422.92 A: i mean 

422.99 432.43 A: you're doing your job you're you're you're you're working really hard and and and that's that's just not going to cut it that's not enough money you know to compensate for anything 

430.10 431.14 B: mhm 

432.77 442.11 A: because it's if you take an honest job like that it's hard work and you get five five something and i mean you've got to pay for lunch a meal 

442.33 444.42 A: a couple of meals like five something 

444.19 448.42 B: i know i know that's a whole hour of work 

444.72 447.34 A: like you know sort of like [laughter] 

448.14 449.39 A: exactly so 

449.02 450.69 B: just to get lunch 

450.30 455.89 A: [laughter] i don't know it it it makes absolutely no sense to me you know and um 

454.80 456.76 B: no that's a good way to put it 

456.51 462.94 A: (( it makes absolutely no sense and [mn] i don't know what's your take on it [laughter] i mean i'm just saying [laughter] )) 

462.46 469.32 B: no i i agree with you i think it definitely needs to be raised i don't know how you would go about it i don't know who does it 

469.16 470.03 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

469.95 470.98 B: um 

471.29 472.17 B: (( but )) 

472.12 486.80 B: [mn] people can't live on that and sometimes they're feeling you know they're the only jobs available to people and and i think that's why they don't raise it because they know that no matter how much the minimum wage is people still need to work so no matter whether they're making 

486.63 487.54 A: mhm 

486.93 500.17 B: five dollars an hour or twenty five dollars an hour a job's a job and i think that's the advantage especially now 'cause the economy stinks you know and they know that so i think that's why they can leave it what it is 

495.87 496.63 A: (( mhm mhm mm )) 

500.16 513.33 B: but you know at the same time like i said before it should be changed de- depending on where you live or maybe even your age or your skills you know like if you have a certain education background this is what you're going to make 

513.20 514.15 A: (( mm oh that's it )) 

513.33 517.73 B: and if you don't have any education then you're not going to make as much as the other person 

518.43 523.99 A: but at the same time mhm at the same time i mean if you know there's um 

518.65 519.53 B: i don't 

524.82 532.88 A: work experience could qualify too i mean for a lack of education is because like they stay in college um but some definitely just have skills like 

532.85 543.37 A: for one year of college it's like three or four years of experience i mean the thing is like if you've covered twelve sixteen years of just school you're pretty much 

534.57 535.44 B: right 

542.27 543.22 B: right 

543.61 553.80 A: unequal but somebody that has a four year college degree you understand what i'm saying because the thing is you have reached that level and and i mean it it's it is recognized you know 

548.27 549.27 B: mhm 

553.68 554.66 B: mhm 

553.81 560.41 A: so i mean so that should still be taken into account i mean there're a lot of factors that should be taken into account and um 

560.52 562.02 A: (( i'm not saying that i mean )) 

562.14 566.94 A: i'm not i'm not against anything i think everyone should be in a 

566.96 569.00 A: there are some situations that people 

569.15 579.41 A: just aren't able to accomplish you know you know and um so i i think and it's like it's it's as you say they should be looked at and and ah you 

570.54 571.53 B: mhm 

579.89 581.52 A: know they should 

580.68 581.65 B: mhm 

582.02 583.10 A: it's a 

583.20 587.75 A: good one you know the fact is that enter and um 

588.23 595.48 A: pretty much your your skill i mean a lot of people are skilled in what they do and um that should account for something you know 

595.72 597.24 B: no it definitely should 

595.72 597.50 A: (( that's why there's there )) 

597.74 599.89 A: there's longevity and they will
