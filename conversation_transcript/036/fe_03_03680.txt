113.04 114.06 A: uh 

114.49 121.16 A: i don't know i mean maybe having some of the types of programs available to to people um would help as well 

121.23 129.81 B: [noise] well i i use it uh to keep telling my son who who was always lazy in school [noise] you can choose minimum wage jobs or 

126.40 127.34 A: uh-huh

144.38 145.38 B: that's true 

145.01 153.76 A: mean it may be more difficult to to to get into college or maybe maybe the resources aren't available because maybe the parents aren't very well to do right 

153.49 155.13 B: [noise] do you realize how 

157.43 161.58 B: what what was that oh maybe my phone was beeping but [noise] we're not supposed to answer it

177.07 177.94 A: uh-huh 

178.11 182.46 B: [noise] they pretty much start at minimum wage [noise] 

181.14 182.97 A: really even at the hospital 

182.75 194.50 B: yeah [noise] a- and especially in our area th- you see a lot of uh poor people [noise] uh you know they're working forty hours a week but let's face it where are they gonna end up 

183.98 184.75 A: (( huh )) 

188.54 189.44 A: uh-huh 

194.16 197.64 A: [noise] well forty hours a week at minimum wage really doesn't [laughter] end up with 

197.09 198.55 B: (( [noise] [laughter] i know )) 

197.93 200.39 A: doing very well it's still rough 

200.48 201.50 A: so 

200.73 201.90 B: [noise] definitely 

202.00 206.32 B: i think i i really think it should be raised a- at least uh 

206.84 207.91 B: six or seven 

209.10 209.95 A: yeah 

209.17 211.73 B: [noise] i i'm sorry that keeps beeping in your ear

214.19 215.07 B: [noise] okay 

214.78 215.65 A: so 

216.94 225.11 A: but yeah no i agree i mean going up a little bit like i said it's not gonna really hurt anybody for it to go up a little bit um [noise] i mean 

221.33 222.59 B: [noise] 

225.28 230.54 A: maybe prices will raise or or or [noise] or employers will have to to 

230.56 237.68 A: economize or not have as high of a a um [noise] profit margin or something but i mean 

237.69 240.98 A: you have to you have to think in terms of 

241.23 246.39 A: what you can reasonably [noise] expect people to live on rather than what you can get away with right i think 

246.70 249.15 B: [noise] i know exactly i agree 

249.47 254.28 A: that that's well i guess uh we may not be a cross section of of 

254.83 256.82 A: the the same uh 

256.34 258.11 B: [noise] 

257.52 263.37 A: [noise] of of i guess we're not representing uh [laughter] the 'cause uh i 

263.42 271.22 A: i work at a hospital too so [laughter] maybe we're a little bit more sympathetic to to average [laughter] people than than most i don't know 

265.52 266.99 B: do ya [noise] 

269.21 276.12 B: yeah [laughter] [noise] well i i don't know i i found myself complaining about my wages as a nurse 

275.69 276.71 A: uh-huh 

276.14 279.24 B: [noise] and then like i said i you know i 

279.26 288.42 B: you know when you go on break and you you've been working there i've been there for nine years so you get to know people [noise] by their face and you talk to 'em [noise] makes you feel bad for complaining 

284.31 285.22 A: uh-huh 

286.11 286.94 A: yeah 

288.22 289.59 A: yeah yeah 

288.38 299.64 B: [noise] when uh they're working hard you know and you get to talking to 'em and they're telling you they're making minimum wage or not much more [noise] and a lot of 'em are single mothers 

295.71 296.74 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

299.40 300.98 A: oh jeez 

300.39 302.09 B: yeah 

301.48 306.50 A: and you think you think to yourself oh my god you know how how could you have held on for so long doing this 

306.26 309.83 B: i know because there's uh no way i could have 

309.21 311.29 A: yeah but then i guess 

311.51 316.96 A: i guess the al- i mean the alternatives much must be worse then right that's the only thing i can think of 

316.19 317.72 B: [noise] i know 

317.46 318.40 A: (( so )) 

318.82 320.58 A: (( [noise] i don't know [noise] )) 

320.66 324.58 B: [noise] well they need to do something i really felt like when they cut the uh 

325.20 339.10 B: the uh welfare programs for these 'cause let's face it [noise] there's a lot of young women out there that made a mistake have children [noise] now they're working for minimum wage i think when they took cut the welfare program for them and limited them to what a year or two 

331.12 332.49 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

338.79 340.08 A: yeah 

339.12 341.87 B: [noise] they should have done something about the minimum wage 

341.83 352.61 A: yeah well definitely i mean it makes it real tough 'cause i mean you're forcing people in a in a really terrible situation to accept a really really bad life [laughter] 'cause i mean 

352.67 359.66 A: let's face it everyone makes mistakes in their life right um but it it's nice to have some sort of options um 

360.03 361.99 B: (( [noise] i know [noise] )) 

361.00 364.70 A: options to be able to get yourself out of it you know but uh 

365.37 374.75 B: i know i i [noise] i just feel i feel lucky and um you know fortunately [sigh] for our kids they won't have to unless they choose that way 

366.21 367.12 A: (( [noise] )) 

374.54 376.33 A: it's true oh

384.34 394.42 B: my one son like i said he's so lazy that's why we're the more he complains about how many hours he's working [noise] and isn't getting anywhere so i i just keep using that [noise] 

390.36 391.10 A: (( senses )) 

393.14 396.34 A: yeah yeah yeah you can just tell him that you know 

396.64 403.41 A: it only gets worse [laughter] you think it's bad now but wait 'til you have other mouths to feed [laughter]

464.92 468.72 B: i know now what state are you in if if i'm allowed to ask 

468.00 470.45 A: uh i don't think that it's um 

471.02 473.52 A: restricted i'm in california so 

472.99 475.36 B: [noise] are you i'm in florida [noise] 

474.36 475.50 A: oh okay 

475.55 477.59 B: (( yeah is is )) 

476.51 482.62 A: i don't even know exactly what this study is supposed to be about i mean i read through it quickly but i sort of forgot 

482.46 485.41 B: [noise] i i i know i read through it um 

485.42 488.57 B: quick too and i i didn't really understand i just 

489.26 494.40 B: uh somebody else on the site where i got the study information to sign up [noise] 

493.39 495.13 A: mhm 

494.43 497.62 B: said that that she knew that it was for real it wasn't 

497.87 499.22 B: you know a scam 

499.35 500.77 B: or [noise] waste of time 

499.43 503.01 A: oh yeah it didn't look like it i mean it's actually on the 

502.05 502.90 B: [noise] 

503.05 504.45 A: penn website 

504.32 505.97 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

504.75 507.45 A: then i figured it wouldn't be a [laughter] scam i was hoping 

506.77 515.42 B: [laughter] no well um is is i i hate to sound um stupid but is the minimum wage the exact same in all the states 

515.89 517.57 A: yes i think so 

517.79 526.30 B: [noise] okay that's what i wasn't i didn't know if it was the same in california as it is here 'cause i i can't remember i think it's five fifteen or something an hour [noise] 

525.71 529.42 A: actually wait i think it may be higher here i think it's like six something here 

527.50 536.11 B: is it uh [noise] is it it's it's five something here 'cause i know with uh my son being at five twenty five he was just above minimum wage 

535.88 545.33 A: oh it's not five twenty five yeah yeah no that that was minimum wage when i was [laughter] at school [laughter] so yeah no it's different then oh why did i think it was 

540.61 542.09 B: [noise] yeah it's [laughter] 

545.44 547.30 A: why did i think it was different 

547.78 550.23 B: [noise] i don't know i i don't know but 

547.93 548.60 A: (( oh )) 

550.72 564.64 B: i do think that uh [sigh] uh you know another thing i think that would help people stuck on minimum wage is if they realized about all the opportunities that there are for them to go to college uh you know [noise] uh community colleges 

562.06 563.59 A: yeah yeah 

564.03 574.69 A: yeah like alternative uh like alternative funding sources or any types of ways like work study or or yeah the thing uh that's a actually a a good point 'cause there's 

569.74 570.75 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

574.90 583.21 A: there's a lot of resources out there that that people who don't have any money generally can't access 

583.39 584.41 A: i mean 

583.70 588.43 B: [noise] right right and um i think that uh perhaps 

588.36 599.95 B: i don't know uh it seems like in the high schools that they cater to the kids that are either smart or you know try real hard [noise] i don't know if they if they actually tell the ki- all the kids 

594.81 595.89 A: mhm
