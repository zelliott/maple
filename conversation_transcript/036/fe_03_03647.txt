0.11 1.91 A: how you doin' this is jermaine 

1.69 3.81 B: hi my name's melissa 

3.53 4.81 A: (( how you doing melissa )) 

4.51 6.15 B: i'm pretty good how're you 

5.84 8.14 A: i'm okay today um 

8.58 12.48 A: just getting in uh actually calling up the system so 

12.25 13.66 B: yeah 

13.01 15.93 A: yeah so minimum wage um 

16.20 18.49 A: it's at five fifteen an hour 

18.08 22.13 B: five fifteen it's not five fifteen in the state i live in i don't think 

21.85 23.77 A: me neither i [laughter] mean 

24.03 25.80 A: (( are you in california )) 

25.21 26.35 B: yeah i am 

26.06 30.85 A: okay me too uh what is it is the minimum wage out here six thirty five 

30.23 38.44 B: i thought it was higher like that yeah definitely and the thing is i know this sounds weird but i don't think i've ever worked for minimum wage in my life 

37.96 42.89 A: okay okay i have uh when i when i was in high school 

42.29 43.21 B: uh-huh 

43.00 47.61 A: and uh back then i think minimum wage was like four seventy five i believe 

46.94 48.32 B: yeah 

48.26 52.39 A: so that was you know that was a couple of years ago but um 

52.63 56.15 A: i five fifteen is not enough 

55.61 63.98 B: no but at the same time it's kind of difficult i mean i remember when i thought making seven dollars an hour was good and now that's almost minimum wage 

56.16 56.95 A: y- 

63.51 66.23 A: exactly you know exact- 

65.21 72.15 B: but it's also hard because the higher they raise minimum wage the more everything else costs they raise the prices of everything else 

71.52 73.28 A: (( mhm )) 

72.39 78.49 B: and so then no one's making a good amount of money anymore so it's hard because you need to be able to live on it 

78.27 79.70 A: right 

79.04 88.97 B: but every time they raise minimum wage they raise the prices of everything anyways so those people aren't making any more money than they were before because the value of that money is less 

83.09 84.00 A: right 

88.56 95.69 A: true th- that man that's so true it seems like i- i- inflation stayed uh at a certain point 

95.74 105.79 A: and the minimum wage went up i think everyone would be living a lot comfortable more comfortable i should say um but like you said that's just not the case 

100.00 101.21 B: yeah 

105.83 106.75 A: that the more 

105.98 114.24 B: yeah well it's kinda difficult you know because i definitely see why people want to have what they call a living wage but it just never happens that way 

112.53 113.33 A: (( yeah )) 

113.81 119.59 A: (( [laughter] yeah ex- exactly true um )) 

116.27 120.48 B: [laughter] it seems like a big catch twenty two i don't know 

119.99 122.73 A: yeah um 

123.20 127.62 A: i and it's like i don't know i wonder 

128.46 131.55 A: if they should set a standard on 

131.94 143.02 A: you you know how like in in little i hate to use sports as a as an example but you know how they have salary caps for for those that are maybe like have been in 

137.92 138.83 B: uh-huh 

143.38 145.01 A: uh the league longer 

145.02 147.28 A: i mean the older you get 

145.15 146.32 B: yeah 

148.35 149.41 B: yeah 

148.78 160.84 A: you you need you need more especially if you have a family there it just goes back to well okay well why you didn't educate yourself or something you know at a job you know what i'm saying 

152.42 153.59 B: yeah 

158.66 159.92 B: yeah 

160.75 167.86 B: yeah i mean i'm definitely grateful to those people who work minimum wage jobs because someone has to work them 

161.76 162.81 A: and so 

165.76 166.49 A: (( yeah )) 

167.50 168.85 A: yeah that's true 

168.52 176.85 B: you know if no one's working them i don't know it just ruins the job market and then the people who are educated may end up having to take lower jobs 

176.54 177.49 A: okay 

176.64 186.46 B: you know like when in uh the bay area when the dot com era was um over and all those people who were making tons of money lost their jobs 

186.49 193.58 B: they were all all of a sudden taking pay cuts that were you know five ten dollars less an hour 

192.51 195.05 A: mm okay right 

194.42 195.83 B: yeah so 

195.13 198.01 A: t- to them not worth minimum wage you know 

197.96 203.35 B: yes all of a sudden they were knocked down to finding jobs that were not that much above minimum wage 

202.97 204.57 A: right right okay 

204.26 209.73 B: making twenty three dollars an hour going to making like eight [laughter] you know isn't ideal 

209.55 222.33 A: exactly you you know what a- and another thing that's funny is check it out like [lipsmack] um i say it was about a year and a half ago i got laid off of a with dell communications company right 

221.84 222.95 B: yeah 

222.33 225.76 A: and i i was probably making close to thirty five a year 

225.46 226.46 B: uh-huh 

226.25 228.56 A: that comes out probably to maybe about 

228.57 238.88 A: sixteen dollars an hour or more and um when i got laid off i got on unemployment and i was getting i was getting about three hundred 

230.40 231.30 B: uh-huh 

234.72 235.67 B: yeah 

239.15 240.37 A: a week 

240.05 241.48 B: yeah 

240.84 243.48 A: which which averages out to 

243.87 245.93 A: more than minimum wage 

245.60 246.88 B: yeah 

246.27 256.59 A: so my incentive to to look for something that would pay me more was was like you know really great you know what i'm saying it's like i felt like if if unemployment was paying me 

256.76 262.06 A: more than i could make in minimum wage i was wasting my time looking for a minimum wage job 

258.58 260.07 B: yeah 

261.78 272.36 B: yeah yeah that's hard though 'cause that that that's the problem you know who wants to take a minimum wage job when they could be getting money from the government that is more than that 

262.99 264.20 A: ev- even though 

272.12 277.92 A: okay exactly yeah yeah and that it kinda you know 

274.63 275.91 B: huh 

278.42 289.95 A: put me in like a little not really a predicament 'cause i i mean it's like i didn't wanna call myself too good for taking it but it was like i just couldn't do it 

289.31 290.65 B: yeah 

290.06 295.13 A: i couldn't do it i i was like you know i i have to at least have about at least nine dollars 

294.68 295.87 B: yeah 

295.23 301.86 A: you know at least nine dollars an hour just in order to keep with my partner i had to move back in with folks 

301.54 303.25 B: yeah well 

302.16 304.44 A: (( what i'm saying just to survive )) 

304.10 316.59 B: see i moved to an area that's a college town um a while ago and the problem with jobs here are really hard to find and when i lived in the san francisco bay area you could find jobs doing like retail 

316.35 325.61 B: for like ten dollars an hour or nine dollars an hour and they paid a lot so here retail jobs were paying like minimum wage i would be 

319.24 320.00 A: oh 

320.59 321.36 A: (( wow )) 

325.43 326.07 A: (( what )) 

325.86 332.83 B: yeah i would have years of experience doing retail and they'd offer me like minimum wage here and i could not take it 

332.82 334.11 A: wow 

333.47 340.27 B: it was very hard to adjust here and the cost of living isn't that much less it's actually almost as expensive so 

340.34 341.41 A: okay 

340.90 349.99 B: it there's different standards different places and california in general is just an exception because things are so different here it costs so much to live here 

349.52 351.18 A: yeah it does 

350.51 358.01 B: so especially san francisco because i was paying a ton of money i could've never ever ever lived in san francisco on a minimum wage job 

357.73 363.07 A: wow is is the uh is the is the rent up there a lot higher than uh the los angeles area 

362.55 370.61 B: uh yeah [laughter] yeah a studio was about when i was living there it was at its highest it was about thirteen hundred dollars for a studio 

370.48 372.09 A: (( for a studio )) 

371.49 377.70 B: yeah [laughter] yeah and now that the prices are low it's nine hundred still 

375.35 376.09 A: (( [noise] )) 

377.89 381.50 A: wow you you can find a studio for under nine hundred dollars 

380.86 386.96 B: uh maybe like seven hundred dollars like living in the back of someone's house but not really 

385.98 387.11 A: oh 

387.30 389.05 B: not really cheaper than that 

389.35 390.53 A: wow that's 

390.62 391.65 A: okay 

391.16 399.75 B: see and in los angeles too i see why more people take the minimum wage jobs because you can somewhat decent rent there but 

398.38 400.58 A: yeah okay okay uh-huh 

399.83 402.58 B: up here it's just not even possible 

402.19 403.40 A: okay 

403.61 405.81 A: uh okay i never knew that 

405.17 406.71 B: yeah 

406.06 407.89 A: yeah uh 

407.11 419.13 B: yeah like san francisco oakland i mean even oakland is not that much cheaper than 'cause i w- you know i lived in san francisco and i worked in oakland and i was looking in oakland for a place and it was only like a hundred dollars cheaper it 

418.92 420.51 A: okay yeah 

419.75 421.95 B: was like why bother you know 

421.42 425.54 A: (( yeah why you yep mm okay )) 

423.57 424.83 B: yeah 

425.70 437.90 B: yeah so i don't know minimum wage it's it's hard because i don't really think about it because i wouldn't really work for it [laughter] um you know like i would- you know i'm too old to work for minimum wage now that's how i feel anyway 

432.02 433.38 A: [laughter] 

438.00 443.86 A: so is that that right there probably about what i was gonna say like 

444.57 448.53 A: why not pay according to your age i'm 

448.26 449.24 B: hm 

448.89 454.67 A: wondering if they could do something like that whereas you know i mean if you're over a certain age 

454.39 460.24 B: or just according to your situation but at the same time you know you have to be careful discrimination wise you know 

459.94 460.72 A: oh 

460.33 461.24 B: so 

461.38 466.45 B: say you work as hard as someone else but they have five kids and you have none 

466.19 469.54 A: (( oh i see what you're saying [laughter] okay )) 

467.45 468.77 B: you know 

469.69 471.07 A: that's a good point 

470.69 484.20 B: yeah so it it's kind of hard and i understand how like presidents have tried to make us a national minimum wage which okay maybe five fifteen is great for someone who lives in the midwest where like you can buy a house for like 

477.42 478.27 A: oh 

484.13 486.61 B: a hundred thousand dollars [laughter] you know 

485.54 488.01 A: yeah exactly that's true 

487.04 491.31 B: but here a hundred thousand dollars isn't gonna get you shit [laughter] so 

489.99 491.12 A: (( no it's not )) 

491.35 493.41 A: yo that's true indeed 

493.41 505.96 B: so it's kind of it's i think our circumstance is very different because we live in california where everything is very expensive and i think people living in the midwest is like are like oh five twenty five that's great you know 

505.38 506.92 A: (( all right okay )) 

506.75 511.53 B: and we're like ah five bucks ah that buys nothing [laughter] 

510.22 512.81 A: (( yeah exactly that's not gonna get you none )) 

512.64 519.94 B: and if you think about it like five dollars an hour let's just say think about how many hours you gotta work just to buy a t-shirt 

512.94 514.44 A: (( so mm )) 

519.67 521.48 A: [laughter] 

520.71 524.70 B: you gotta work like half a day to buy a t-shirt 

524.41 526.46 A: (( just to buy a t-shirt that's true )) 

525.98 529.93 B: yeah that's that's pretty bad in [laughter] california you know 

529.11 530.99 A: (( uh yeah )) 

530.36 532.91 B: could you imagine trying to feed your family on that 

533.03 535.44 A: nope no way 

535.12 538.62 B: no you gotta work for like two hours just to eat at taco bell 

538.20 541.84 A: exactly that's truly at taco bell man 

538.89 540.08 B: [laughter] 

541.18 542.84 B: yeah 

542.21 545.60 A: yeah that wouldn't stand too well i know that's 

545.65 555.97 A: lot of people would just uh they group up and you know just save their money and just try to move up outta that that minimum wage uh bracket 

555.05 557.00 B: yeah yeah 

556.57 565.56 A: and uh go from there but um when you say national minimum wa- are they are they talking about for all the states when they say that 

564.95 573.92 B: yeah i think that um i wanna say clinton was trying to and maybe he did he set a national minimum wage so the whole nation gets 

573.70 582.41 B: at least five fifteen i think that's what it might be but here it might be higher but i think everyone's supposed to get in the whole nation at least a certain amount of money 

578.25 579.00 A: yeah 

582.32 583.35 A: wow 

582.98 586.60 B: which is great for other states that have lower 

586.75 590.14 B: uh lower costs but here that just doesn't work 

588.88 589.61 A: (( okay )) 

589.86 594.74 A: (( no it's not gonna work mm mm no not at all um )) 

591.38 592.45 B: nope 

595.00 596.42 A: like uh 

597.01 599.89 A: you said you never even even in high school or anything
