0.15 1.32 A: (( hello )) 

0.88 2.04 B: hey 

1.90 4.23 A: hi this is michael 

3.72 5.19 B: my name's claudia 

5.07 6.52 A: hi claudia 

5.98 7.29 B: (( and where're you )) 

7.06 8.51 A: i'm in california and you 

8.20 10.38 B: oh i'm in wilmington north carolina 

10.06 12.42 A: oh wow this so this really is long distance 

11.80 13.96 B: [laughter] it really is 

14.58 16.66 B: what part of california are ya in 

16.25 18.14 A: i'm in los angeles at the moment 

17.08 19.05 B: los angeles oh 

18.32 19.07 A: yeah 

19.58 22.48 B: well i think we're supposed to talk about minimum wage 

22.54 24.05 A: yeah um 

23.43 26.95 B: and i didn't know what it was until she just told me [laughter] 

25.70 31.89 A: you know i'm glad they included that information too it's been a long time since i've earned minimum wage have you ever had a minimum wage job 

31.47 32.36 B: no 

32.23 37.85 A: no oh i used to work at wendy's but that was back when i think minimum wage was four twenty five 

37.68 42.41 B: oh my gosh well now i take that back when i was in high school i did 

37.98 38.82 A: so 

42.60 43.65 A: (( oh yeah )) 

42.72 45.04 B: i did have a minimum wage job 

44.74 46.10 A: where did you work 

46.06 48.04 B: i worked at a a 

48.11 51.32 B: dime store little five and ten cent thing 

49.28 50.15 A: oh 

51.79 54.20 B: and it was fun then but i wouldn't do it now 

53.55 57.68 A: [laughter] i worked at wendy's i worked the grill and so 

54.40 55.20 B: [laughter] 

57.73 66.76 A: um i did it 'cause not 'cause i had a great aspiration of having a [laughter] career in the fast food industry but i needed the money so 

63.67 64.87 B: [laughter] 

66.71 70.30 B: well i i honestly don't think that it's enough 

70.26 82.19 B: because in this area people there are a lot of people that can't find jobs other than minimum wage jobs and they would they would rather sit home and collect welfare 

77.86 78.78 A: mhm 

82.17 83.16 A: yeah 

82.56 84.96 B: because they can actually make more money 

85.38 89.16 A: it's kind of a difficult thing see now i have mixed feelings on it uh 

89.27 90.93 A: there are certain jobs 

91.31 93.55 A: a- a- as much as i empathize with someone 

93.59 101.12 A: it's hard to set a national minimum wage and i just barely moved to california from from utah and so in utah 

101.14 102.96 A: um i was paying 

101.80 106.53 B: i i was getting ready to ask you that because you [laughter] you have that accent [laughter] 

105.83 111.17 A: actually i i grew up in in mexico city so it's i [laughter] have an accent from all around 

110.12 112.70 B: but you sound like salt lake city [laughter] 

112.07 114.41 A: well it could be i spent enough time there 

114.30 126.32 A: but uh and my dad's from that area but um there i was paying something like four twenty five a month for rent and then i moved here and for a one bedroom apartment i pay eight seventy five 

125.89 127.67 B: my gosh 

126.11 140.64 A: it se- it seems really s- yeah a- and not that um you know that there should be a a living wage standard but in the sense that it's hard to declare one that's uh applies to the entire country and because 

139.83 141.54 B: that really isn't fair 

141.19 156.19 A: it really you know if you set it to what's a living standard here in in california i- it would just i think kill uh businesses in other parts of the country that just don't have the you know something comparable or as you said something that's fair in say 

156.23 165.95 A: i don't know we'll take san antonio 'cause that's that's where my family's from and san antonio my parents uh were about to sell my grandparent's house 

166.03 178.17 A: and that's a three bedroom house on s- some land i mean not tons and tons but it's got a front yard and a sizeable backyard and that cost about ninety six thousand and the median house 

178.22 180.62 A: cost in los angeles county 

181.02 189.13 A: uh what did i hear the other day was two hundred and ten thousand dollars and that's that's [laughter] yeah it's uh 

189.53 193.03 A: so i i think it it should it be raised uh 

193.26 198.67 A: well it'd be nice if everyone that was working um you know had the chance to 

198.68 206.26 A: and needed to support their families had a living wage but it's so hard to set that at a national standard i don't know how you could do it in a fair way 

205.08 210.81 B: uh i don't know how either because i know i spent some time in staten island new york and uh 

211.01 214.22 B: living expense there was unbelievable 

213.56 214.82 A: mhm 

214.35 221.90 B: and if if i had if i personally had to work for minimum wage i couldn't live on minimum wage in wilmington 

221.84 222.67 A: (( mm mm )) 

222.07 227.29 B: and the cost of living here i guess is not nearly as high as it is in other places 

227.55 230.09 B: but then we are right on the beach 

229.69 231.96 A: [laughter] 

230.16 235.19 B: so that you know that raises the price of everything just because you've got the water there [laughter] 

234.88 243.55 A: yeah it yeah it really my wife lived up in uh northern california for a little while so she was in the bay area which is just astronomical too so she's 

242.56 245.84 B: but it's really not fair i mean now 

246.21 249.16 B: what sixty miles inland 

249.29 251.05 B: when you're in the country 

250.66 251.68 A: mhm 

251.07 255.58 B: i mean minimum wage you can do twice as much with it as you could here 

254.11 255.20 A: right 

256.12 265.08 A: yeah i- i- it's a it's a difficult problem to tackle i don't know h- h- how to do it i- in a fair way because you know let's pretend that you live in an area where 

264.93 279.15 A: where you're a business owner and y- you have to provide at least minimum wage to your workers if you live in an area that just doesn't have the economic base to support high minimum wage i mean a living wage for what a living wage would be in california i- i- it just it's just 

278.93 286.49 A: no matter how you slice it up a national uh minimum wage doesn't seem like it would be fair to to somebody either it'd be too little 

285.22 299.08 B: but you know what if they if they did like if they paid say ten dollars and twenty five cents in california and five dollars and the fifteen cents here then everybody's gonna want to move there if they were working for minimum wage 

299.17 303.17 B: 'cause they aren't gonna think about the the cost of living i mean young people 

299.53 300.51 A: yeah 

303.07 304.39 A: yeah 

303.57 308.94 B: they don't think about the cost of living they all they see is the dollar yeah the dollar sign 

306.66 308.03 A: the dollar sign 

307.93 322.00 A: you know my dad had a similar he was offered a job in san antonio and offered a job in california and they made almost the same except a little bit more in california but when he figured out the cost of living it was just so much more in san antonia the amount even though he was getting paid less in terms of dollars 

321.98 335.65 A: then he would be if he were it's almost like it's a different currency like there's a california dollar and a north of texas dollar 'cause it just isn't worth the same you buy the different buying power and it's really complicated i and there's also i think another issue of like 

327.32 328.20 B: yeah 

331.31 332.31 B: well 

335.96 337.59 A: [sigh] i mean 

337.47 347.67 A: some some jobs are really quite easy and that don't have a whole lot to it i have to admit my my minimum jo- wage job of flipping burgers was probably worth about what they were paying me 

346.58 348.83 B: [laughter] 

347.43 358.45 A: a- and you know i- it's [laughter] i can't i can't say that i did a whole lot that would have been worth m- more than that at the time you know this was years ago but um 

356.60 363.63 B: well i teased i i taught school for twenty nine years and i retired three years ago and 

363.76 368.20 B: i always said i'm working for minimum wage because you're 

367.25 371.05 A: gee i thought that'd be less my dad was a teacher [laughter] 

369.46 380.96 B: [laughter] you're there all day and then you come home and you're grading papers and and doing paperwork all night and then you're up and you're at it again the next day and i always teased well i'm just working for minimum wage i mean what can i say 

373.08 374.10 A: uh-huh 

380.83 385.78 B: but after i retired i have found out that i'm actually making as much money 

381.00 382.19 A: that's the truth 

385.85 389.55 B: not working as i was when i got up and went to work every day 

389.42 390.72 A: oh goodness 

390.08 402.11 B: because of all the other things that you know driving to and from work paying for clothes to go to work and you know all those kinda things when you consider everything you're you're just about making as much 

396.28 397.21 A: uh-huh 

397.67 398.59 A: wow 

402.66 406.07 B: to stay home as you did to get up and go work with your retirement 

405.12 415.75 A: wow see now th- th- that's one thing that does i think need to be changed in terms of how much we're investing in education it seems like it's one of the first thing to to go and it's it's really an investment in the future so 

414.87 425.63 B: well if it really is and and it's not about children anymore it's about paperwork and test scores and all the guidelines you have to follow and 

425.74 439.25 B: that's why i left i didn't even stay my thirty years and and the lady told me she said they're gonna penalize you they're gonna take five percent of your retirement and i said that's fine there are potholes everywhere let 'em pay the could probably do one or two with what they're paying me 

439.00 441.82 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

439.38 440.26 B: so 

440.44 445.21 B: [laughter] but you know i really did i felt like i was doing the minimum wage thing 

445.15 458.90 A: yeah you know it wouldn't surprise me too [noise] i mean education is considerably underpaid uh but i mean they're also you are in p- sometimes there's a position particularly in the areas of of high integration where people come in and they don't h- necessarily 

445.25 446.62 B: all those years 

458.68 465.20 A: a skill set where they can say okay well certainly we'll put you to work in in engineering in yet these people are heads of households 

464.94 465.80 B: yeah 

465.19 472.55 A: and so i- it's really hard it's hard to decide what is fair and minimum wage is uh it's nice 

472.40 487.30 A: in a sense but i think in the areas that like for instance i don't know who makes minimum wage around here no that's probably because i really haven't looked i wouldn't here in california i i couldn't afford to live o- on what the national minimum wage is but uh 

486.44 495.09 B: you know what really shocked me are all the teenagers you know they get they turn sixteen they get their license they get cars they get a minimum wage job 

494.76 495.91 A: mhm 

495.29 503.74 B: and i know they're all living at home with their parents and they don't have to pay rent they don't have to buy groceries but none of 'em ever eat at home they're always eating out 

498.50 499.59 A: mhm 

500.87 501.76 A: right 

503.75 504.80 A: yeah 

504.19 512.40 B: and i can never understand how they can do it and the college kids we're in a college town and the college is what less than a half mile from from my house 

511.29 513.09 A: mhm mhm 

512.40 522.05 B: and all these kids they have these fancy cars i mean they're driving mercedes they're driving you name it and all these big s._u._v.s and the whole college campus is covered with them 

517.80 518.95 A: right 

521.90 523.79 A: right i've seen it too yeah 

523.15 531.78 B: and you go out they're at barns and noble drinking those four dollar cups of coffee or whatever and they're always in the fancy restaurants eating 

527.57 528.61 A: mhm 

531.83 536.88 B: and i'm like where are they getting their money i mean then they have a part time job but they're working for minimum wage 

537.41 549.41 A: yeah well uh i think uh students i've seen a lot of people that wrack up some serious student loans uh so that that that might be part of the answer i think the other thing is that uh i think 

549.70 554.06 A: [lipsmack] i don't know maybe it's changed somewhat but um 

554.91 564.32 A: i i actually was helped by my parents somewhat but i have to say that i paid for most of my college either through scholarships or working over the summers and stuff uh 

560.29 561.34 B: yeah 

563.95 565.95 B: i had to work too [laughter] 

565.26 576.78 A: so ma- o- o- occasionally there were semesters that i was short and i got some money from my parents and they didn't mind th- they decided i was cheaper out at college because i paid for more of my stuff then when i was living with them at home [laughter] 

575.91 583.28 B: well i see these kids running around and i know they're working minimum wage jobs because there's nothing out there for 'em that pays more than minimum wage 

583.35 588.64 B: and i just don't know where unless their mom and dad are sending them extra money i don't know 

588.64 591.57 A: i don't know it's kind a yeah i haven't 

591.79 599.89 A: figure- uh i don't know i- it'd be nice to see those people that need a a living wage that really depend on on their work to be able to do so
