116.57 117.38 B: ah 

117.44 130.78 B: ah for being a resident so everything is tax free that's why a lot of people move to oregon a lot of companies like dole and herring and david and and ah 

124.43 125.58 A: right 

130.12 131.42 A: (( right )) 

130.75 137.05 B: berber and that are all here because of ah their product is tax free 

137.21 139.69 B: so and when they said it's five 

138.44 142.63 A: so there's no sales tax and no grocery tax is there an eat in tax 

142.45 143.36 B: no 

143.48 144.54 A: wow 

144.89 155.61 B: a oregon has always been that way and so when they said five fifteen i was like there's still somewhere out there that's five fifteen [laughter] i was like woo 

153.16 154.28 A: yeah 

154.74 160.98 A: it's pret- it's pretty cheap out here like i don't know what's a one bedroom apartment cost out there 

159.34 163.37 B: [laughter] about two twenty five 

162.90 164.36 A: really 

163.83 166.69 B: (( yeah ah you can get a )) 

165.51 168.40 A: here here is at least four hundred 

168.10 176.91 B: right see here you can get a two bedroom for about four sixty five and that's with a shower upstairs and downstairs 

176.87 178.58 A: oh my gosh 

176.95 177.92 B: so 

178.25 180.26 B: so it is considerably 

179.01 181.48 A: (( o- oregon here i come [laughter] )) 

180.41 184.51 B: [laughter] a lot of people move here because of that reason 

184.69 189.95 B: especially like we're at the tip of oregon between the california border 

190.06 191.74 B: and ah 

192.23 195.91 B: the minimum wage is is six ninety here 

195.74 210.43 B: california it's six but california you have hefty state tax and then you have the other taxes so most people will come from california live in oregon for a while then then they'll leave you know they'll be like oh okay 

202.69 203.70 A: gee 

210.56 214.53 B: i had my time i did my my tour de force 

214.59 215.91 A: [laughter] 

214.60 221.19 B: but ah [laughter] so it sounds like it's it's considerably more in your area 

221.34 222.28 B: um 

221.45 230.69 A: i mean for for kids working living with their parents like fast food i guess i understand that but adults should have their own minimum wage 

230.81 233.71 A: 'cause a- an adult just can't make it on that 

230.84 233.46 B: right well actually i think 

233.48 241.39 B: i i think between working at fast food and also working a regular job 

241.49 247.12 B: they still need ha- to have the ah difference in in rates 

247.33 248.28 A: yeah 

247.35 255.41 B: because of wi- with like fast food well fast food shouldn't be qualified but like restaurants where you make tips 

255.46 264.59 B: where like over here i know ladies that are that ah also work at herring and david is where i work um that 

255.75 256.71 A: right 

262.02 262.58 A: (( [noise] )) 

264.83 265.99 B: wait 

266.11 270.09 B: and they wait for their extra money because 

268.94 274.43 A: well what's the minimum wage for for ah like what do they get paid two thirteen 

274.53 279.45 B: um actually here in oregon they get paid six to start 

279.61 281.13 A: plus tips 

280.60 292.87 B: mhm so they they'll work five hours at herring and david at ah we start i i mean whereas with us in my office about eight dollars 

281.88 282.98 A: really 

292.89 297.88 B: and then they'll in the evening they'll go work five hours and make a bundle 

298.00 301.42 B: doing that 'cause it's six dollars and then you get your tips 

300.02 304.30 A: is it like that an- anywhere that you get tips they get paid six 

304.11 304.94 B: uh-huh 

305.18 306.94 A: oh my gosh 

306.65 309.82 B: see we're um actually i think 

308.26 310.39 A: (( see we get paid two thirteen )) 

310.25 324.79 B: yeah see ah i had talked to somebody this topic was on earlier when when they called me too and i talked to somebody and he said they get three dollars and fifteen cents an hour in idaho 

311.14 312.32 A: that's nothing 

325.04 326.91 B: i was like wow 

327.12 333.80 B: here they start ah well in california i remember when i was a kid they paid us three thirty five 

327.27 328.16 A: yeah 

334.15 342.41 B: and now they pay six fifty for minimum wage working in a restaurant but you get your tips so you know 

343.06 354.23 B: i didn't know they were still five fifteen and two thirteen and two the the three fifteen ah yeah and somebody needs to get those all in line [laughter] 

347.27 348.63 A: yeah 

348.91 351.24 A: [laughter] 

353.21 354.71 A: yeah 

354.88 360.50 B: i guess and it sounds like the middle states are are not ah up to date 

360.28 367.37 A: no well i heard a few years ago there was like a a certain county in california where minimum wage was nine fifty 

361.20 362.14 B: yeah 

367.56 370.84 B: yes there actually is that is in 

371.32 374.84 B: mm i think it's in sonoma county 

375.01 376.01 A: gee 

375.85 377.69 B: (( and see their their )) 

376.85 382.09 A: but there to live there it's i mean i'm sure an apartment is like you know out the roof 

381.80 389.67 B: right it it depends on ah what you want also see like we have a four bedroom house 

389.79 397.52 B: and large backyard and a large front yard and then we also have an extra ah like a um 

397.79 402.54 B: work shack but it's the oh about a quarter of the house that's in the back 

402.65 415.06 B: and we only pay eight hundred a month for that where the same thing if you were to go to california would be about fourteen hundred nevada it would be about twenty one hundred i lived in nevada also 

415.00 425.66 B: so [laughter] you know we it it's a good deal for something like that especially if you had a friend to move into with or whatever to move to oregon 

416.80 417.46 A: (( mm )) 

422.29 423.24 A: right 

426.39 432.74 B: i that's just amazing that indiana also a- and that's really low for 

427.52 428.84 A: gee 

433.28 436.72 B: for a wage for waiting could you imagine if you 

436.77 439.95 B: were one of those people who gave that service 

440.10 442.42 B: and they didn't leave a tip 

442.49 447.92 A: yes [laughter] i i've been there that that's usually what i do for a living 

443.49 444.87 B: [laughter] 

448.02 448.93 B: (( mm )) 

448.24 448.78 A: (( ah )) 

449.00 449.94 B: so how 

449.34 453.85 A: i'm trying to get into office jobs now because it's just so inconsistent 

454.00 455.93 B: right 

454.43 457.99 A: and then and the hours are always coming and going and 

458.21 460.12 B: yeah that just whew

463.23 465.41 A: two thirteen mhm 

464.14 465.62 B: two thirteen 

465.70 470.16 A: i got paid three fifty at one job and four dollars at another one 

470.20 476.61 A: that were just little privately owned things and they did that's just what they wanted to get people but they only have to give you two thirteen 

476.83 478.06 B: well oh my goodness 

477.22 479.58 A: and most like big places like 

479.63 484.27 A: and ah any place like that ju- will only give you two thirteen 

484.46 490.04 B: yeah they they think you're going to get a lot more tips because it's more people who were 

490.08 499.09 B: classy that are coming to the restaurant but most of them unless you give them super service give you a buck you know you're like woo 

492.78 493.92 A: right 

496.29 497.24 A: right 

497.49 503.51 A: well and and i was working the lunch i was working lunch and if you weren't in the bar you didn't get that 

503.45 504.95 B: oh god 

503.94 511.03 A: because they all would come in their for lunch and the bar would be crowded and have a weight list 'cause you couldn't smoke anywhere else in the restaurant and 

511.24 520.41 A: and so you just sit there all day and you got six servers and you get six tables between six servers and [noise] [mn] ask who it is i'm on the phone 

517.89 518.77 B: (( mm )) 

522.39 524.36 A: [noise] tell him to call back in five minutes 

524.84 525.40 A: (( [noise] )) 

525.93 527.59 A: i'm on a survey thing 

529.70 531.37 A: two many phones [sigh] 

530.75 533.69 B: [laughter] same with my house 

533.98 534.72 A: huh 

534.43 545.92 B: [laughter] so it it doesn't sound like it the even with the five dollars and fifteen cents yeah it's better but it's not that much better 

545.93 551.40 B: in your area especially if you're paying four hundred for a one bedroom 

547.63 548.49 A: right 

551.58 554.11 B: that's just that's really bad 

553.49 554.79 A: yeah 

554.34 558.58 B: and is it just you your husband and your and your child or 

557.95 561.74 A: well see i'm i'm single it's just me and my child so 

561.40 563.46 B: oh i see 

562.47 568.43 A: yeah and the dad's in jail i don't get child support and it's it's just really hard 

563.56 564.90 B: oh see so 

567.78 570.26 B: oh i can understand 

568.53 569.53 A: and then 

569.92 584.14 A: you know working with the babysitting just five fifteen [laughter] would never cut it and you know everybody tells me just go get a job go get a job anywhere and i can't go get a job anywhere because it'll barely pay for daycare i can't pay my bills with it 

583.97 588.47 B: yes it do they pay a lot better for daycare in that area 

588.55 590.62 A: this is about a hundred a week 

590.37 596.85 B: ooh see that's actually kind of nice it's that's cheaper than what it is here daycare is pretty 

595.07 596.47 A: what is it there 

597.31 599.89 B: [sigh] depending on how many i
