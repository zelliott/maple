12.02 18.55 A: uh yeah uh i was actually originally from oklahoma but i've been in vegas now for uh for about two years 

17.94 23.45 B: oh i'm in pennsylvania right outside philadelphia but um i'm from salt lake city originally 

21.58 22.88 A: [laughter] 

23.51 24.88 A: oh cool 

25.31 34.33 A: right on so what was the topic again minimum wage [laughter] oh well that's terribly interesting [laughter] 

27.28 30.05 B: minimum wage [laughter] yeah 

32.26 36.73 B: yeah [laughter] do you think that five dollars and fifteen cents an hour is sufficient 

37.01 39.23 A: uh not even close 

38.70 39.98 B: right 

39.24 43.78 A: i hon- honestly to tell you the truth i don't even know how how 

42.52 43.71 B: (( [laughter] [cough] )) 

44.45 50.90 A: people can survive on that kind of money i don't think i've made five dollars and fifteen cents since i was 

50.96 53.59 A: oh eighteen or something uh 

53.37 54.41 B: right 

53.71 56.68 A: maybe earlier and i'm twenty seven now so you know 

56.24 57.14 B: right 

57.19 58.09 A: so 

58.10 62.62 A: it's kind of i don't know you know i've i've [laughter] 

60.58 68.82 B: i think even before i was fifteen i was making more than that for uh like five fifty or five seventy five working for 

63.72 67.31 A: [laughter] yeah exactly 

68.93 71.48 B: some dumb temp agency [laughter] [cough] 

70.90 78.19 A: yeah exactly i don't know i mean i'd uh i've had friends that have had you know been on minimum wage for 

78.13 89.96 A: for quite a while and i've i mean i've had people that have actually raised families on i've seen people that've raised families on minimum wage and it just boggles my mind how they can do it because 

89.52 92.07 B: i don't see how it's possible at all 

91.57 95.52 A: [laughter] i mean don't you realize uh doesn't it seem like 

95.77 105.47 A: expenses are going up way faster than minimum wage is you know maybe maybe just overspending i don't know what the story is [laughter] 

96.50 97.27 B: (( [cough] )) 

99.16 100.85 B: oh yeah yeah 

103.87 109.07 B: no i just think i mean even out here where i live the cost of living is just incredible it's 

109.22 110.61 B: in in utah 

110.81 124.39 B: there's the cost of living is a lot lower than it is out here i mean everyone in in the town that i live in like three quarters of the families have mansions and you know drive b._m._w.s and they all talk about where their kids go to school and [laughter] 

114.47 116.37 A: right 

124.37 126.16 A: (( really )) 

124.50 128.96 B: you know all that and it it boggles my mind when i came here because 

129.30 141.06 B: i wasn't used to that growing up in salt lake you know the people aren't all money oriented i mean you have some people everywhere but it's just it's unreal out here and the millionaires and [laughter] you know 

131.97 133.80 A: right 

140.83 143.76 A: yeah 

141.05 146.35 B: but um there it's just it would be physically impossible to survive on five dollars 

146.42 151.33 B: y- you know even if it was five fifty an hour you know whatever it is [laughter] 

149.02 156.99 A: yes exactly i mean i could i could understand if you had maybe a couple of kids and the place you were working the benefits were just 

151.64 152.23 B: (( [cough] )) 

156.97 168.78 A: outrageous but the even then i don't see how you would i mean if you could walk to work every day and you didn't have to you know put clothes on anyone then i guess i could i could understand it but uh 

157.94 158.73 B: right 

165.20 166.06 B: right 

168.71 169.66 A: jeez i mean 

169.65 184.29 A: i would say las vegas is not terribly expensive it's not nearly as expensive as oklahoma is but i i don't know how anybody could minimum wage out here i don't first of all i don't even know anybody that works for minimum wage out here except for like uh 

169.76 170.55 B: right 

175.20 176.04 B: right 

184.11 192.27 A: uh maybe not even valets you know people th- people that survive on tips they they they get more than minimum wage you know 

185.86 186.45 B: (( [cough] )) 

189.14 190.27 B: and get t- 

191.45 194.43 B: right just to get the tip yeah 

192.04 202.13 A: just to begin with yeah and uh in oklahoma i guess there's a fair amount of folks that i knew that were living on minimum wage but you know they're also 

196.09 197.38 B: (( [cough] )) 

201.92 210.10 A: they're also getting tips maybe like uh uh you know pizza boys and stuff like that but yeah 

206.90 207.71 B: right 

207.96 214.46 B: or waitresses i know waitresses i used to be a waitress and i would get half of minimum wage 

211.86 213.74 A: right 

214.38 217.92 A: oh really yeah 

214.67 222.97 B: plus my tips i mean i i got two dollars and thirteen cents an hour [laughter] when i was waitressing and it all went to pay the taxes on 

218.89 220.73 A: (( [laughter] oh )) 

223.19 228.61 B: it it all went to taxes every every two weeks i'd get a paycheck that would be like negative [laughter] 

228.41 230.31 A: (( right really )) 

228.50 242.12 B: it'd be zero or it'd be like you owe thirteen cents or whatever and um [laughter] yeah 'cause that's what they'd take my taxes out of for um but then i got to take all my tips home and and they said if if it doesn't 

232.21 236.22 A: [laughter] that would kinda suck 

239.43 243.29 A: right did your tax more than minimum wage 

242.77 254.67 B: yeah they said if it ever didn't equal to minimum wage that they would the restaurant would compensate me for that up to minimum wage [laughter] but i always and i mean that was when i was at high school or [laughter] you know 

249.28 251.15 A: right 

251.25 252.48 A: (( oh )) 

254.34 265.20 A: yeah yeah that's uh i don't know i mean that's that seems kind of i can understand minimum wage for kids you know that are in high school you know that 

255.19 256.13 B: so 

264.76 266.84 B: or like under eighteen 

266.62 276.75 A: yeah they just b- they just need some extra pocket cash or something or you know they need to pay the insurance on the car their parents bought for 'em or who knows you know knows whatever but uh 

269.31 270.15 B: right 

273.79 274.97 B: right 

276.59 284.59 A: i mean if you're actually supporting yourself or god forbid you're supporting a family i mean i don't know how you could ever possibly 

279.75 280.59 B: right 

281.34 282.25 B: right 

284.17 287.62 B: well and and it's crazy because you know people 

287.45 299.53 B: in order to get better jobs that pay more money they need to go to school and you can't pay for school on minimum wage you can't even pay the balance on a student loan with minimum wage [laughter] you can't do anything 

294.28 296.10 A: yeah exactly 

296.77 299.69 A: [laughter] exactly 

299.41 307.22 B: it's just ridiculous and then people get mad about all these people who are on welfare or you know government programs 

299.70 301.25 A: yeah 

307.36 320.40 B: and you know and i do i know that people take a dis- you know they take advantage of the system but at the same time i worked at for a housing company in philadelphia and i saw all of the families who who 

307.77 308.97 A: right 

313.49 314.36 A: sure 

320.46 325.59 B: had both parents working separate jobs one would work the night shift and one would work with the day 

325.52 338.81 B: so they could take care of their kids and they were making like five or six dollars an hour and they worked twice as hard as any of these rich businessmen who [laughter] you know make a couple of phone calls and [laughter] and you know make a thousand dollars it 

325.78 327.21 A: right 

333.99 337.76 A: (( [laughter] )) 

338.34 339.91 A: right right 

338.88 351.44 B: and it just made me really mad because the the whole the work that goes into it i- if you're working at mcdonald's you're working a hard day you know [laughter] you have grouchy customers you have grease all over you you 

346.97 349.02 A: yeah that is true 

350.71 353.74 A: [laughter] 

351.42 356.06 B: [laughter] and um for someone to say that you're i don't know 

356.25 358.99 B: i just think your time is worth more than 

356.41 358.22 A: yeah 

359.46 362.63 B: that but at the same time people need to 

359.56 361.56 A: yeah i i would 

362.88 369.67 B: maybe hold out longer for better paying jobs you know because if no one's working those jobs then 

366.44 368.65 A: (( right how c- bu- )) 

369.76 378.42 A: yeah i could understand if you had to start at minimum wage with a guarantee that you were going to get some crazy raise after maybe like three months or something 

378.19 387.55 A: just you know they're starting me off there just to make sure you're not gonna bone out on 'em within uh you know twenty days or something like that but uh 

378.23 379.13 B: right 

384.17 385.12 B: right 

385.30 386.12 B: right 

387.33 398.34 A: i mean to to actually try and survive on that and to buy all the necessities and i mean i i look at my i i budget myself money every month you know for 

398.19 407.18 A: just just regular spending money you know things that if i'm gonna be out you know if i wanna go get a coke or uh gonna go out and eat with some friends or something then 

401.28 402.12 B: right 

405.06 405.93 B: right 

406.64 407.40 B: right 

407.11 420.99 A: i would say that just for that i would probably need a fulltime minimum wage job that doesn't include my rent you know my car payment any of that stuff so i don't know it seems a little ludicrous to me but 

412.05 413.05 B: right 

413.72 414.90 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

415.18 416.25 B: exactly 

417.23 417.99 B: (( [cough] )) 

418.98 430.46 B: well i have a baby and so to have i mean a pack of diapers we go through at least two packs of diapers a week and they're ten dollars a pack even with coupons and everything else you can't i 

427.43 429.33 A: yeah [laughter] 

430.78 435.57 B: mean that's two hours of your or that's four hours of your time right there [cough] 

433.31 440.48 A: yeah [laughter] ex- exactly after tax and everything you've just spent half your day buying a pack of diapers and uh 

438.45 439.66 B: right 

439.91 441.73 B: and let alone daycare 

441.77 443.81 A: right 

441.91 449.55 B: putting your kid in daycare so that you can go to work it that's i mean that's why i'm staying home now is because i was making um 

449.58 457.87 B: like seventeen dollars an hour at my job but it wasn't worth it to commute downtown to philadelphia because city wage tax is so high 

452.38 453.47 A: (( [laughter] )) 

457.77 470.56 B: it costs a hundred and thirty six dollars a month to take the train you know it's just like everything was so expensive that it was just w- you know i'm breaking even to stay home and i get to be with my baby all day 

462.56 464.57 A: right 

468.78 470.60 A: yeah
