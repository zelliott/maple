0.54 2.43 A: (( hello i'm nathan bialki )) 

2.41 4.89 B: hi i'm benjamin stow 

5.93 6.93 A: (( how're you today )) 

8.41 11.65 B: uh is this your first time doing this too 

11.81 14.14 A: um actually it's my third time 

13.62 14.55 B: uh 

16.27 24.76 B: yeah i don't know why they selected this topic where we live the minimum wage is uh beginning six ninety an hour 

24.86 26.36 A: oh where's that 

25.87 27.49 B: uh in oregon 

27.44 28.50 A: (( oh okay )) 

28.32 35.54 B: so [laughter] [laughter] so when it said five fifteen or whatever it said i was like okay 

29.45 30.82 A: [laughter] 

35.20 41.11 A: yeah see minimum wage is five fifteen here and since there is no national minimum wage it's kinda curious 

41.03 48.72 B: yeah see here it's six ninety and another six months it's gonna go up to seven fifty five 

48.45 50.11 A: well that's a big increase 

49.71 56.21 B: yeah [laughter] it seems like we get increases all the time so it's like okay 

50.63 51.68 A: [laughter] 

56.26 60.42 B: five fifteen i don't so which state are you in 

60.43 61.46 A: idaho 

61.30 71.48 B: idaho that's why it's still five fifteen okay 'cause i was gonna say when i lived in california they're up to six and a quarter i think it is [laughter] 

62.20 62.99 A: yeah 

64.02 66.24 A: [laughter] yeah 

71.42 72.56 A: (( oh okay )) 

72.24 78.42 B: so it's like okay i didn't know they still had people at five fifteen [laughter] 

74.76 75.92 A: (( uh-huh )) 

77.86 82.15 A: that's what happens when you have state that's like ninety percent republican [laughter] 

81.39 87.73 B: [laughter] understandable [laughter] that's the way i'm looking at it 

87.04 88.52 A: yeah 

87.97 89.17 B: (( [sigh] )) 

89.68 104.52 B: so are are things more expensive in idaho i know things are really cheap here especially we have a lot of uh even with the minimum wage at as it is we're a lot of consumable products 

89.77 90.72 A: so 

104.61 110.11 B: and and so there's a lot of workers doing like harry and david catalogue is here 

110.19 111.49 A: yeah we 

111.63 112.95 A: i don't know i 

113.24 128.19 A: it's pretty cheap but sometimes it's kinda hard to find like items they can consume are cheaper but sometimes with housing and things like that it's kinda hard to find that that you could afford with minimum wage because with taxes and all that 

128.05 131.17 A: ends up being almost expensive as any other state 

130.78 134.02 B: right do do you guys have state tax 

134.23 140.53 A: uh yeah it's uh i- i- income tax and uh um uh sales tax 

140.40 141.87 B: mm see 

140.93 143.02 A: oregon doesn't have sales tax does it 

142.79 144.13 B: no it doesn't 

143.82 144.89 A: (( oh okay )) 

144.69 153.20 B: and w- we just have state tax which is ten percent which isn't that bad 'cause if you- you're considering other states 

148.45 149.40 A: okay 

150.41 151.48 A: yeah 

152.97 160.54 B: so that i could see why it would be an issue for you with minimum wage [laughter] being only five fifteen 

158.38 159.27 A: [laughter] 

160.63 165.94 B: but that would be understandable that's why you guys have a lot of walmarts 

163.30 164.26 A: yeah 

165.67 169.14 A: yeah [laughter] and that's how they get their employees 

166.18 168.42 B: [laughter] 

168.87 173.52 B: yes that's how they get their employees i originally worked for them 

173.45 175.11 A: yeah you work for them 

174.91 179.37 B: um no i don't i work for harry and david catalogue company 

176.17 177.48 A: oh okay sorry 

178.39 181.07 A: oh okay mis- i mis- i misunderstood you 

180.85 182.94 B: [laughter] 

182.06 183.10 A: um 

183.44 187.42 A: yeah too many people pay minimum wage i- 

187.66 189.86 A: sometimes it's just like if you're 

189.87 194.24 A: who can pay as little as five fifteen we're gonna pay as little as five fifteen [laughter] 

194.22 195.31 B: (( mm )) 

195.33 202.43 A: and i think it'd be actually better if there was [laughter] no minimum wage i mean because then they'd actually have competition for prices for 

202.57 204.63 A: salaries but i don't know 

204.67 209.52 A: it's really bad because it's just five fifteen that's the way it is because that's what the law says 

209.60 211.05 B: right 

210.29 212.99 A: and we know we'll get jobs either way so 

213.14 215.98 B: yeah and see but i just 

216.05 221.70 B: five fifteen seems like so little especially if you're doing the forty hour week 

218.79 219.78 A: yeah 

221.72 222.95 B: that's like 

221.75 222.81 A: yeah that's only 

222.82 225.38 A: two hundred and fifteen bucks a week or so 

225.12 229.29 B: yeah and that that's considerably considerably low 

229.87 230.92 A: yeah 

230.35 233.02 B: [laughter] 'cause i remember 

233.88 242.86 B: with the minimum wage when it wasn't regulated in oregon and california was three thirty five when i was in high school 

242.99 245.81 B: so imagine living on three thirty five an hour 

243.23 244.05 A: (( [laughter] )) 

245.92 247.04 A: yeah 

246.71 257.80 B: so [laughter] five fifteen to those those people would seem like a blessing but now that that it's anywhere's from six fifty to six ninety depending on which state it's in 

257.61 261.54 A: is the sales tax in oregon progressive or flat 

261.10 267.10 B: i it's flat it's straight it's straight ten percent for for your state tax 

262.45 263.55 A: (( oh okay )) 

266.61 270.88 A: oh okay well at least it's a little bit better than idaho because it's progressive tax 

270.74 271.97 B: (( uh )) 

270.91 276.09 A: i i haven't paid taxes in about well ever [laughter] 

274.45 276.84 B: [laughter] 

276.97 278.22 B: (( ooh so )) 

278.45 281.04 B: (( you guys are are um )) 

281.16 283.59 B: at five fifteen an hour 

283.47 291.04 A: yeah what um i'm i'm not employed right now i'm at high school but i have some 

284.71 286.72 B: and what do you do for work 

289.26 290.63 B: oh i see 

291.40 294.70 A: some income based on savings and for the summer 

294.60 296.02 B: mhm 

295.64 304.94 A: and [sigh] i think the you can get all that exempt up to what is it fifty seven hundred a year or so like that 

304.58 305.77 B: mhm 

304.95 309.26 A: and then after that and then it goes up really slowly so 

309.69 310.55 B: right 

310.42 316.92 A: after that although i still wouldn't wanna live off minimum wage fortunately i can rely on my parents [laughter] 

313.92 315.02 B: yeah 

316.08 320.81 B: [laughter] i could not imagine working at five fifteen 

320.98 322.24 A: yeah 

321.67 333.18 B: so if you were working out there and you were to get a job and let's say it wasn't fast food do they start all of all of you at five fifteen or is it 

333.86 345.51 A: mostly all five fifteen unless it's um job that's n- new requires qual- like qualification for and that um some physical laboring positions pay a little bit more but 

345.70 352.84 A: i don't know i'm more for the office side of i'm i'm looking for a job right now and i can't even find one at five fifteen an hour 

353.22 358.96 A: because there's just so many jobs and they all pay five fifteen and everybody'll take 'em 

358.63 365.84 B: hm so do they pay a lower rate for um people who work in uh restauranting 

365.72 374.36 A: yeah i think it's three bucks an hour so long as the tips go up above the minimum wage if they don't it's minimum wage fortunately 

374.44 375.96 B: that's terrible 

375.93 376.86 A: [laughter] 

376.03 378.27 B: i i could not imagine [laughter] 

378.35 379.67 A: yeah 

378.93 383.33 B: i could not imagine working for three bucks an hour 

383.11 395.25 A: and up until um a couple we- months ago there there was no minimum wage they'd offer uh um i- farm workers [sigh] so that that was really really abused 

392.56 393.50 B: (( hm )) 

395.51 397.65 B: and that was for farm workers 

397.27 402.07 A: yeah um mostly migrant workers for seas- for seasonal jobs 

398.10 398.78 B: (( so )) 

401.46 402.58 B: mhm 

402.35 404.23 A: and um 

404.98 409.13 A: a lot of 'em were n- any any job they can get so 

409.38 416.45 A: somebody'll just pay i i think the lowest i've i hear- heard of is about three bucks an hour [laughter] 

416.14 417.84 B: ooh that's terrible 

417.45 418.78 A: yeah 

418.19 420.56 B: that is really bad 

421.49 426.24 B: so what type of work were you looking for where it's all five fifteen an hour 

426.80 434.99 A: uh mostly any job i can get here i've applied at most of the uh restaurants in town and then walmart and the the the sales places 

435.18 440.30 A: but the problem is most of those are going out of business because of uh walmart [laughter] getting here and 

440.09 442.67 B: yes walmart has that problem 

442.25 453.76 A: [laughter] well yeah i i sort of live in the middle of nowhere so there's no um need for anything um when walmart came i mean it can take uh 

442.82 444.56 B: [laughter] 

447.23 448.23 B: mhm 

452.54 459.26 B: yeah walmart takes care of everything especially do your walmart's have the grocery store with them also 

455.00 455.92 A: yeah 

458.74 461.17 A: yeah they h- they at least have the 

461.21 468.23 A: disadvantage of not having a butchery there so the local grocery stores have that slight advantage but 

468.77 480.05 A: [sigh] so uh it's the busiest place in town they actually moved uh one of the signs that said welcome to mountain home the town town i live in to walmart [laughter] 

478.30 480.56 B: [laughter] 

480.65 484.95 B: i can understand so i can understand why it's such a 

485.59 490.50 B: dire need to raise the minimum wage in your area 

490.13 496.06 A: yeah i just i i would support raising it but also just change it at all because 

496.54 501.90 A: i think a five fifteen is so it's too low to live off of 

502.08 503.45 A: but so 

503.54 510.98 A: either get rid of it your competition or raise it i prefer raising it so that they don't so it doesn't become too low but 

511.09 516.26 A: the problem is that they just see the law the law says five fifteen and that's the wage they set 

516.26 525.28 B: yeah eh and it's real expensive for living in your area except for consumables is that what what you said 

524.14 529.39 A: it's not not really expensive it's just not cheap i i i would say it's comparable to um 

529.64 534.02 A: uh most rural states well like m- montana 

534.43 537.35 A: or uh wyoming or something like that 

536.80 537.70 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

538.25 541.72 A: at least it's not expensive that's [laughter] the benefit 

541.44 545.01 B: [laughter] that is a benefit 

544.62 547.47 A: yeah i used to live in um england so 

547.62 549.37 A: that i w- 

549.47 557.15 A: i'm not um m- don't remember if they had a minimum wage there but you couldn't have lived off of it because the cost of living's so high 

557.54 558.41 B: (( hm )) 

559.64 563.50 B: wow th- that is different 

563.49 576.06 B: uh especially with the minimum wage we we also i've lived in nevada also and over there the minimum wage is six dollars so idaho must be one of the l- least 

572.48 573.40 A: yeah 

576.15 577.25 B: paid then 

577.99 580.67 A: uh i would probably guess so [laughter] 

580.16 582.22 B: (( yeah [laughter] 'cause if uh )) 

583.09 589.54 B: i wonder i wonder if there's any others that are are at that at that rate because of 

589.99 592.86 B: i just could not imagine living with uh 

593.70 595.36 B: that [laughter] 

593.86 594.67 A: (( eh )) 

595.03 599.90 A: it'd probably be some other rural agricultural states that have the minimum wage for farm work-
