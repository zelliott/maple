10.46 16.66 B: [noise] [noise] as far as the minimum wage ah what'd they say it was five fifteen now [noise] [noise] ah 

14.74 16.48 A: (( yeah all right )) 

16.90 21.52 B: [noise] [noise] i don't really think that it's ah it's sufficient but 

21.54 22.75 B: um 

23.72 28.28 B: i guess it also depends on [noise] the area or the country that you're living in also 

28.09 29.71 A: (( ye- yeah )) 

29.11 35.96 B: [noise] [noise] um i live on the east coast so [noise] [noise] ah okay and and the cost and everything is very high over here 

31.62 32.96 A: (( oh so do i )) 

35.19 40.45 A: oh yeah yeah i live right outside of new york city actually so [laughter] 

39.08 42.64 B: [noise] [noise] oh so and and i'm not far from there myself either [noise] 

42.11 43.63 A: (( all right [laughter] )) 

43.06 44.25 B: (( [noise] [laughter] [noise] )) 

43.83 45.52 A: [laughter] 

44.85 51.19 B: [noise] so um back when i was working minimum wage was only like three sixty five an hour so i mean [noise] [noise] it has come up a little bit 

49.25 50.76 A: oh wow [laughter] 

51.24 52.12 B: but 

53.02 55.74 B: i i still think that's kind of low 

55.59 60.91 A: yeah oh yeah absolutely like i don't i mean like i know people who are like 

61.77 62.69 A: (( like )) 

62.89 68.12 A: i don't think that will help them like get a like will help their situation at all like i don't know 

66.69 78.61 B: [noise] [noise] but exactly exactly i mean you get some people that you know they lose their jobs and all they can find is working for minimum wage at like mcdonalds or something and [noise] [noise] and how can how can they support a family on that 

75.16 75.99 A: (( yeah )) 

78.12 82.86 A: right or like yeah have housing and it's just ridiculous that there're people like 

80.54 81.68 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

83.04 91.17 A: bill gates who are making like fifty billion dollars while they [laughter] i don't know i'm minimum wage it's like five dollars [laughter] 

87.04 88.60 B: sure sure 

91.82 94.31 B: [noise] [noise] yeah yeah that's right i mean i'm su- 

95.12 101.97 B: i can't see them i mean making it something like ten dollars an hour or something like that either because i mean you got some people that you know 

102.47 107.68 B: have better jobs than that and that's what they're making so i mean that really [noise] [noise] wouldn't be fair [noise] 

105.82 106.56 A: right 

107.11 108.16 A: yeah 

108.29 115.71 B: [noise] so i mean i guess it it's you know i it's kind of hard to say it it's it's a that's a tough call 

115.40 117.10 A: yeah [laughter] 

115.72 116.47 B: like [noise] [noise] 

117.09 120.63 B: um and is there have you done this before [noise] [noise] 

120.27 121.60 A: done this before 

121.27 122.34 B: yeah [noise] 

121.98 125.11 A: yeah this is my last this is my third time actually [laughter] 

123.91 128.60 B: [noise] third day mine too and it's very hard [noise] [noise] to talk for ten minutes [mn] [noise] 

125.94 126.62 A: (( oh )) 

127.26 132.64 A: yeah i know that [laughter] we always like wind up talking about something else [laughter] 

131.54 132.67 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

132.84 138.80 A: i'm actually i'm in um college like like right now i go to school in boston so 

134.21 134.87 B: (( it's )) 

137.15 138.82 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

139.03 143.86 A: so i'm coming back home to new jersey though in a few days [laughter] 

142.83 145.35 B: [noise] [noise] where in new jersey [noise] 

144.96 146.32 A: (( ah oh )) 

146.35 149.71 B: [noise] okay 'cause i'm in um county [noise] 

149.53 152.04 A: okay yeah 

150.10 151.40 B: [noise] [laughter] 

151.47 155.77 B: [noise] [noise] and i'm [noise] [noise] and i'm fr- from massachussetts [laughter] 

152.50 153.82 A: (( each other [laughter] )) 

155.56 158.86 A: oh really near boston [laughter] 

156.34 157.48 B: (( [noise] [noise] yes [noise] )) 

158.07 160.49 B: thirty miles north east yeah 

159.73 161.63 A: (( oh wow [laughter] )) 

160.93 162.62 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

161.94 164.60 A: that's funny [laughter] 

165.64 166.79 A: (( [laughter] )) 

165.86 180.02 B: so [noise] [noise] um like i mean i like it i know they tape this conversation and it it you know i guess it is very hard to to say like is it depending on the part of the country that you're in [noise] [noise] um the cost of living and everything but um [mn] [noise] 

167.07 167.71 A: (( [mn] )) 

175.62 176.69 A: yeah 

180.59 181.80 A: yeah i know 

180.86 193.77 B: [noise] i guess some somebody in high school gets the minimum wage it's fine you know and [noise] [noise] five fifteen an hour is fine for them they're living at home and [noise] [noise] really pretty much being supported by their their parents so [noise] [noise] for someone like that [noise] 

185.17 186.52 A: yeah it's really 

188.33 189.46 A: yeah 

191.08 192.24 A: (( for a )) 

192.99 195.00 A: job yeah or something 

193.94 195.58 B: [noise] exactly 

195.61 204.53 B: but um somebody who's trying to support themselves and or a family then then five fifteen an hour definitely isn't enough 

204.93 218.43 B: but then again maybe it is an somewhere to start till they get their foot in the door and then can find something else um [noise] [noise] some people just don't want to apply themselves either and look for higher paying jobs and [noise] [noise] just take whatever they can get 

210.58 211.51 A: yeah 

216.36 217.13 A: yeah 

218.29 222.18 A: (( yeah um [mn] )) 

221.78 225.19 B: (( [noise] [noise] i don't know what else to say about it [mn] )) 

223.71 229.20 A: [laughter] i mean i'm sure like there are consequences from ah 

229.39 231.28 A: like m- there'd be like are 

230.43 231.31 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

231.29 236.94 A: amazing that minimum wage and we don't know how it would affect the economy or something like that 

235.63 250.24 B: mhm and then again if you think about some of the jobs too they they are they are no brainers so [noise] [noise] you really don't need to get paid more than minimum wage for what you're doing i mean as [noise] [noise] far as you know wrapping a hamburger in a pap- piece of paper 

241.10 242.82 A: (( yeah )) 

246.84 247.66 A: right 

250.17 258.38 B: um [noise] [noise] how how much you know it doesn't take a rocket scientist to do that [noise] [noise] so in in that sense then minimum wage actually can be 

250.41 251.61 A: yeah [laughter] 

254.08 255.06 A: right 

258.64 265.79 B: quite applicable to the you know or serving coffee at a dunkin donut you know [noise] [noise] h- h- how hard is it to pour a cup of coffee 

262.97 263.77 A: yeah 

265.68 266.80 A: (( mhm )) 

266.30 277.68 B: [noise] [noise] you know so i i think it also depends on what the type of job is and [noise] [noise] and and how much skill level you need as to whether you really should get paid the more than minimum wage [noise] 

270.79 271.68 A: right 

277.45 278.59 A: yeah 

278.35 283.54 B: [noise] i mean that that's about all i can really say on the [noise] [noise] the the matter [laughter] 

281.66 287.26 A: [laughter] yeah i don't [laughter] else to say [laughter] 

285.43 286.71 B: [noise] 

287.10 291.72 B: [noise] and that's a tough topic [noise] [noise] so what're you going what're you going to school for 

289.20 290.29 A: (( yeah ))
