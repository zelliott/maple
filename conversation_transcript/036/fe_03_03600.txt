3.81 5.19 B: (( how you doing )) 

4.80 6.37 A: good how are you 

5.66 6.89 B: okay 

7.40 9.68 B: um you want to go first 

9.19 16.66 A: [laughter] okay well i i'm just ah now hearing the minimum wage i i actually didn't know what the minimum wage was so 

16.93 21.74 A: um [mn] the topic is ah the increasing of the minimum wage 

21.05 22.93 B: right do you think it's enough 

23.28 31.79 A: um i'm sorry is it constantly five dollars and fifteen cents is that okay so um no i i 

28.19 29.36 B: yeah 

32.01 37.62 A: i don't think it's enough and ah i think with today's increasing 

37.73 40.48 A: standards of ah living 

40.55 44.02 A: i mean it's it's not sufficient enough to support 

44.15 45.86 A: oneself ah 

46.05 47.21 A: working 

47.27 48.13 B: mm 

47.36 49.73 A: (( you know the the full time )) 

49.66 50.97 B: yeah 

50.35 52.24 A: (( ah hours )) 

52.91 67.25 B: yeah i i agree with you because we personally there's a lot of people society hasn't yet realised that there's a lot of people in this world that as far as they have gotten is high school graduated from high school 

52.97 53.92 A: (( you know )) 

67.32 74.30 B: and they can't go out and get thirty thousand dollars an hour i mean a thirty thousand dollars a year job 

74.16 86.44 B: so but they still need to support their family and five dollars and fifteen cents is not enough because i make seven dollars a hour with two kids with both fathers missing 

86.38 87.66 A: (( mhm mhm [noise] )) 

86.56 96.17 B: and i'm barely holding on by dear life you know what i'm saying even when like for instance i'm tr- i'm trying to apply for an apartment 

89.90 92.02 A: mm mhm mhm mhm mhm 

96.44 108.96 B: and at seven dollars an hour i don't even meet the minimum income requirement to apply for a apartment that is in a bad neighbourhood so imagine somebody on five fifteen 

108.99 110.44 A: (( wow mm mm mhm )) 

109.07 114.74 B: you know it's it's just not going to happen and people need a place to live they need a place to stay 

111.41 112.40 A: mhm 

114.55 124.55 B: and if i feel as though if they can give so much money to all these people across seas over here need help over there need help what about us 

124.34 126.57 A: right right right 

124.73 126.89 B: you know what i'm saying what about us 

127.12 138.66 B: that's that's just i think it's just completely ridiculous they need to take care of themselves first and then worry about other people five fifteen an hour is not enough to live on 

138.41 139.88 A: (( mhm no no )) 

138.84 149.94 B: you know enough to support a family we have a lot of single mothers out here that are doing just that working at mcdonalds trying to take care of their kids on five fifteen 

142.92 143.90 A: mhm 

149.59 151.09 A: mhm mhm 

150.41 154.63 B: (( and i mean my kids eat more than that [laughter] )) 

153.21 157.00 A: yeah and also i am a product of a single ah 

157.32 160.40 A: parent fam- household for i guess a a 

160.86 162.53 A: quarter of my ah 

162.55 171.32 A: half of my life [laughter] and um you know fortunately there were government jobs you know available to ah people 

163.73 165.03 B: (( mhm ))

183.43 188.22 A: well um the priorities now like you said are not in um 

188.41 190.29 A: you know the domestic 

190.41 191.53 A: um 

191.98 198.13 A: ah are not concerned more or less with our domestic economy and are you know it's like a forgotten 

195.97 196.92 B: right 

198.41 201.52 A: um portion of our society 

201.21 202.22 B: right

232.25 243.13 A: i i didn't know what the minimum wage [laughter] was and i thought it was ah at least ah seven dollars and hour or six or six at the minimum 

239.48 240.74 B: oh no 

244.02 249.54 A: so [sigh] yes and and then it also raises the question of you know ah 

250.07 256.26 A: receiving financial ah or aid from the the government too you know th- the people 

254.28 264.81 B: mm mm well what happens what happens with that i know because i used to get it well the minute w- if you're not working at all and you're not doing anything at all 

259.32 260.30 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

265.15 268.45 B: they will pay you about six hundred dollars a month 

268.97 277.16 B: the minute you go out and get a job they say hey we're going to cut that down to thirty dollars a month and it could be at a five dollars fifteen cent 

274.77 275.69 A: wow 

277.29 278.26 B: an hour 

278.46 281.02 B: and they will cut you down to thirty dollars a month

290.88 298.34 A: you know without straying too far [laughter] from the the topic i just hope that you know with the election

312.50 315.54 A: lower brackets of our society 

315.25 317.02 B: right exactly 

315.96 320.29 A: it's a consideration and ah instead of international 

320.52 321.79 B: exactly 

320.95 322.86 A: affairs [laughter] 

322.34 323.63 B: exactly 

323.54 328.56 B: they need to they need to they really do but the minimum wage i really think 

323.92 324.68 A: so 

328.39 338.66 B: is completely and totally off the charts when there's so much money circulating in the united states that's like saying i can make a i could put some words on a paper 

334.90 335.84 A: yeah 

338.53 346.84 B: and put a little tomb behind it and make millions but i can't use my hands and my brain and make more money 

341.80 342.71 A: mhm 

346.47 348.04 A: mhm mhm 

347.16 357.67 B: that's basically what they're saying or i could play football and crash into another human being and make millions but i can't use my hand and my head to make money 

349.11 349.95 A: mhm 

352.78 353.69 A: mhm 

357.28 358.96 A: mhm mhm 

357.81 360.73 B: that's what they're saying basically to me anyway 

360.41 361.41 A: (( right mm )) 

360.74 364.33 B: you know i'm saying if if if they if they can 

364.44 374.21 B: h- have an appearance for these people to the small time millionaires and celebrities and stuff one appearance and they're getting paid seventy thousand dollars 

373.90 375.89 A: mhm mhm 

374.64 376.48 B: there's money out there 

376.23 377.92 A: oh yeah definitely 

376.63 380.07 B: five fifteen should not be a minimum wage 

379.73 385.39 A: well there what there needs to be and um there's probably just a a re a 

385.46 387.35 A: re- ra- rationing 

387.22 389.07 B: right exactly 

387.99 391.27 A: [laughter] ah shared wealth in 

391.25 392.53 B: exactly 

391.68 394.44 A: society here is not um 

392.99 394.36 B: exactly 

394.72 405.66 B: yeah we have several people that's immigrants they come over and they don't know how to do anything else but they still have families so they get those five fifteen an hour jobs 

400.20 401.06 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

401.83 402.78 A: right 

405.81 412.83 B: so how are they taking care of their families you let 'em in our country and then you pay 'em little or nothing if they go for it 

406.15 407.03 A: mhm 

412.48 413.47 A: mhm 

412.86 414.41 B: (( [cough] you know what i'm saying )) 

413.52 416.52 A: well those people too are you know they're 

416.55 428.48 A: most of them th- they come from you know like families where you know everyone lives under just one roof you have second and third generations [laughter] living under one roof and um 

423.60 424.72 B: exactly 

425.28 426.85 B: exactly 

428.23 431.72 B: right but do we really want to be portrayed as that 

428.91 430.33 A: yeah to think that 

431.80 433.23 A: no no 

432.92 437.98 B: exactly they need to make some serious changes with that i really do 

437.75 441.08 A: well w- what do you think would be a um a substantial 

441.51 446.28 A: ah increase or a sufficient increase in the minimum wage so it's 

445.96 447.61 B: at least to seven 

447.69 448.81 B: at least 

448.06 449.37 A: yeah 

449.38 450.84 A: (( mhm )) 

450.54 451.61 B: i mean 

451.65 457.20 B: i realise that th- there's only so much that you can do 

457.53 460.48 B: but at least give people a shot 

460.39 461.84 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

460.78 469.56 B: because with a seven dollar an hour job you can at least go out and get a little part time job on the weekend and make up the difference 

467.91 469.08 A: mhm 

469.82 477.25 B: you know what i'm saying but with a five fifteen an hour job you have to get another full time job just to even get the ten 

469.91 470.80 A: mm 

477.06 488.83 A: oh yeah yeah 'cause i i'm thinking at least ten dollars i mean because if you l- if you look at it especially if you have a family like you said if you're a single um a single parent 

477.64 479.78 B: (( [laughter] you see what )) 

488.16 489.56 B: (( i'm saying right )) 

488.88 499.00 A: you know y- y- y- you want to you need to have time you need to have time with your your family so you know you're spending all your time being o- b- bringing home the 

494.59 496.06 B: exactly 

499.12 502.18 A: finances and not um you know 

502.54 510.25 A: taking care of business with with the family [laughter] so i'm i'm thinking you know at least ten dollars an hour 

505.27 507.10 B: right right exactly 

509.73 511.64 B: yeah that's sounds like a winner 

511.30 517.24 A: or just you know in in proportion to um what the standards of living is if 

517.26 518.88 B: (( right )) 

517.26 526.76 A: like it in the very you know the m- the minimum s- m- minimal standards of living they need to ah i guess recalculate those costs 

522.64 523.54 B: mm 

526.49 531.85 B: exactly right you're absolutely right you're right about that that's true 

527.41 528.78 A: [laughter] 

531.84 544.08 B: they do people need to be home be able to work and supply ah supply what their family needs and be with their family as well but ah also another solution might be 

537.95 539.04 A: mhm 

540.69 541.78 A: mhm 

544.23 547.53 B: when hiring or reviewing a person 

547.66 552.88 B: their pay can be based upon their household size 

552.64 554.27 A: mhm mhm 

553.42 555.95 B: because if you have a 

556.25 562.68 B: fifteen sixteen year old making five fifteen an hour that's perfect for him 

562.55 565.64 A: mhm oh right right yeah for 

562.97 564.31 B: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

564.28 569.94 B: because they're not doing anything they don't have no where to spend their money they got to pay no rent they got to pay no bills none of that 

569.73 570.79 A: (( right mm )) 

569.83 579.39 B: but then again if you have a twenty to whatever age with two kids or three kids they need a little more 

579.49 581.28 A: mhm mhm 

579.87 584.04 B: so base it upon income i mean you know household size 

583.91 584.96 A: mhm 

584.32 589.97 B: or if it's just a single mom and well i mean just a single woman and a single man 

589.80 590.80 A: right 

589.82 599.89 B: the only thing you have to worry about is rent and probably electric or whatever bills they have to pay or whatever i'm not saying they'll cut 'em short because they're they don't have any children or anything like 

595.01 596.16 A: mhm
