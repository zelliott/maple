89.22 90.23 A: i i 

90.42 93.49 A: i choose to live where i where i do live because it's 

93.54 105.31 A: it's out of the city and ah you know the complex that i live in has some stuff that other places don't have but if i were only making five fifteen an hour there's no way i could afford to live here 

105.16 107.62 B: well what you would have to do is share 

109.18 110.37 B: (( it you know what i mean )) 

110.41 111.24 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

111.17 115.77 B: you'd have to share it now like you know what wh- what part of what part of the country d'you live in 

113.37 114.16 A: yeah 

115.83 117.69 A: ah just outside memphis

119.30 120.47 A: yep 

120.03 125.51 B: wow i i took the as well 'cause i live in southern california and believe me it's outrageous here you know 

125.73 126.84 A: oh i [cough] 

127.15 131.85 A: yeah i heard that you know a starter home out there goes for like what two hundred and fifty thousand or something 

132.09 133.01 B: (( for what )) 

133.11 135.02 A: for a starter home in california 

134.64 145.40 B: [noise] well i have a i have a three bedroom two baths at seventeen hundred square foot house and my house is worth about five fifty to six hundred thousand believe it or not i was shocked 

146.50 150.84 A: ah now would you consider that a starter home or would you consider that like your second house 

150.94 157.00 B: yeah it's a it's a little bigger yeah it's not like a two bedroom one see i live in a very i live in a very hot area 

156.96 157.70 A: (( yeah )) 

157.69 165.88 B: i live in the middle of the city in a hot area so you know everything i mean these little starter homes are like four or five hundred thousand and yeah it's very expensive 

165.74 170.99 A: yeah how how are you gonna afford that you and your wife lets say are making five fifteen an hour each 

170.82 172.69 B: (( but [noise] right )) 

171.21 175.53 A: how how are you ever gonna get to the point where you could buy a house that's five fifteen an hour 

175.59 176.65 B: yeah 

176.87 179.79 B: (( you know the the the other side of coin is )) 

179.80 183.43 B: if minimum wage was too high 

184.34 189.71 B: here's the other side of the coin if minimum wage was too high then we'd probably have a lot of unemployed [cough] 

190.17 195.25 B: you know if minimum wage was like ten twelve dollars an hour then we'd probably have high unemployment you know 

195.86 201.28 A: ah i i agree if you put it too high it puts a lot of little independent businesses and whatnot out of business 

198.04 199.40 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

201.17 203.39 B: yeah yeah 

201.46 210.39 A: but i i mean somewhere in there between ah just using your numbers ten twelve dollars an hour and five fifteen an hour somewhere in there's gotta be a happy medium 

210.22 218.52 B: yeah yeah we gotta find so- yeah 'cause it's really it's a and actually something that encourages people to ah get themselves off welfare you know 

219.02 222.96 B: 'cause you get almost as much for not working as for working you know 

219.58 220.25 A: huh 

222.77 225.37 A: exactly exactly 

224.03 226.71 B: yeah you could yeah 'cause you know what i mean 

227.32 228.87 B: (( welfare )) 

228.95 240.63 B: actually i i have some tenants that are on r- relief and they get about it's unbelievable they get about six seven hundred dollars a month they get money to go to school and they get food stamps so why work for minimum wage you know what i mean 

240.66 244.58 A: yeah what's the what's the encouragement to go out and actually get a job when i 

243.99 245.03 B: yeah 

244.37 249.86 A: mean i realise that you know minimum wage is not what you're gonna make your entire life i mean it it's meant to be 

249.63 261.48 A: you know a starter job or or you know something like that but [lipsmack] people don't look at it that way especially if if they're um getting assistance or you know they're they're 

251.62 253.33 B: right 

261.51 272.65 A: getting a job later in life and they haven't had to previously they'll look and go you know how am i gonna pay my bills how am i gonna get my stuff you know get some fancy stuff at five bucks an hour you know 

272.33 274.92 B: right right 

275.62 281.37 B: [lipsmack] yeah this is yeah it's pretty ah pretty tough ah it's a pretty tough subject you know 

281.69 282.77 B: i mean 

282.94 284.51 B: do you want to get ah 

284.55 285.37 B: (( you know )) 

286.13 286.96 B: (( you know [lipsmack] )) 

287.38 291.09 B: it is a pretty tough ah subject um 

291.17 296.45 B: yeah it's really been ah you know like i said i mean they should raise it 

296.63 300.29 B: may- yeah you're right maybe seven eight bucks is sufficient you know 

301.29 306.20 B: maybe seven or eight bucks 'cause if two people are on seven or eight bucks they could do something you know [cough] 

306.62 309.33 B: (( depending on what part of the country you're living in you know )) 

310.62 321.57 A: that's a i you know i would think ah obviously it's gonna depend on the part of the country 'cause what would work let's say here or you know in new york or in minnesota perhaps may not work in california 

321.58 328.44 A: but i i think you're on the right track there i mean seven eight bucks kinda in the middle ah i don't think that that's unrealistic 

326.37 327.72 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

328.62 330.91 B: yeah yeah i don't either 

331.21 336.19 A: and and the market would dictate that you know if if it were raised to lets say 

336.13 347.03 A: six fifty or seven bucks the market itself is gonna balance out where there it's not gonna be six fifty you know a lot of places down here they don't start at five fifteen they start at six six fifty 

342.66 344.32 B: right 

347.45 350.09 A: so if the minimum wage was a little bit higher 

347.51 349.28 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

350.15 355.97 A: the market itself is gonna adjust that up because no one's gonna take that right at minimum wage job 

356.84 365.13 B: yeah and you well you and then we have the problem you have the same problem that we do we have a lot of illegal immigrants working here too you know you know latin california 

364.97 366.22 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

365.91 370.17 B: and that believe it or not that i- i- it that kind of makes sense because 

370.48 371.53 B: i mean 

371.59 384.68 B: you know it works two ways that's another thing [noise] the issues i mean these people are working for under the minimum wage two three dollars an hour now the thing is they're they're doing stuff like you know picking fruits and vegetables and stuff and you know if 

384.65 394.14 B: (( if we're gonna pay the minimum wage for that i mean you you you you you know i mean w- w- we'll be just paying probably three or four dollars for an apple you know what i mean )) 

394.02 395.40 A: right right 

394.78 399.03 B: yeah well that's it you know that's another coin that's another thing too so 

398.21 407.03 A: well yeah and you're always gonna have people that are that are willing to work under the table or willing to work for minimum wage for or or less than minimum wages for say for whatever the reason 

406.97 407.85 B: yeah 

407.27 412.97 A: um an- and i think that's part of the reason that they can keep the minimum wage as low as they can because 

412.94 424.89 A: you know they can fill some of these positions with people that for what ever reason don't want to work above the table be they illegal or let's say they have some tax judgements against them or or whatever 

424.96 426.36 A: where they're willing to work 

425.10 430.68 B: yeah or maybe they c- yeah or maybe they're collecting workman's comp or something like that or disability yeah 

429.37 434.96 A: yeah whatever where they don't it would be not beneficial for them to report their income 

434.64 442.24 B: (( right right i mean i mean um yes i don't know i don't know if if the yeah 'cause )) 

442.26 451.98 B: i was in that situation at one time for a short period of time [noise] you know believe it or not you know i mean i ended up in that situation i didn't plan on it you know 

451.96 453.64 A: yeah 

452.98 455.20 B: (( i ended up in that situation you know )) 

455.38 456.21 B: ah 

456.41 465.70 B: 'cause it ended up that you know where it wouldn't have worked if the [noise] i was doing two jobs one of them i i wasn't making much out of two jobs one of them i was getting paid the other one 

465.81 474.04 B: well i was getting paid under the table but it it's you know it was good that i was getting the money under the table 'cause it wouldn't have paid for me to work two jobs you know it 

473.79 475.24 A: yeah yeah 

474.61 477.13 B: wouldn't have paid so um 

476.14 486.62 A: ah when i was younger when i was like fifteen i got a job working washing dishes at a place and ah it wasn't beneficial for them to have anybody on the payroll 'cause they were such a small business 

486.63 492.99 A: that for them to have to pay fica and all the other taxes and whatnot they they wouldn't have been able to afford to have anybody 

493.06 494.42 B: right 

493.07 499.42 A: but you know they were like hey you know we'll pay you at the time i think minimum wage was 

499.58 504.73 A: like four fifty or something and i think i got like four bucks an hour or something under the table 

503.90 506.10 B: (( [noise] so let me ask you something )) 

505.13 506.09 A: and ah 

506.39 509.76 B: um i i never had to wait tables but um 

509.90 516.15 B: waiting tables i think that's an exception to the minimum wage waiters and waitresses right 

515.82 523.97 A: ah in some states it's that way in some states like new york the minimum wage is five fifteen but if you're waiting tables the minimum wage is two ninety five 

518.03 518.97 B: okay 

523.60 530.00 B: right that's what i mean something yeah i think some most states are like that because ah yeah they're jobs are on tips you know 

529.96 531.63 A: right right 

530.06 537.59 B: yeah yeah well i had a friend that worked he did very well he worked as a waiter in room service 

537.57 546.88 B: and he was making up ten twelve years ago he was making seven eight bucks an hour he got all his medical benefits union benefits plus he got tips [noise] 

547.60 549.22 A: that's not too bad mhm 

548.59 560.60 B: yeah that was pretty good and all he did was um well i mean they were paying everything on they gave them the check he just took it up to a room on a cart and they and they would give him free tips like fifteen percent or something like that you know what i'm saying 

560.48 566.45 B: i mean that was that was pretty damn good and he got all his free meals and everything you know that was good 

566.83 569.74 B: that was really good so you know 

570.09 573.72 B: i thought that was really good but um you know 

573.88 577.55 B: you know i ah you know i mean they gotta do something about the minimum wage 

577.90 580.60 B: (( yeah terrible )) 

579.26 586.69 A: i agree and i mean obviously i don't i don't know about your situation but i'm i'm past the point where i need to take jobs that are at minimum wage 

586.74 587.90 A: and ah 

587.79 588.77 B: yeah 

588.06 599.89 A: but i still have i still have sympathy and and empathy for people that do and ah i agree i mean i think they need to do something 'cause it's just not you know it's not a wage where you would be able to support yourself 

592.44 593.52 B: yeah
