43.24 48.05 B: ah yeah i i don't know m- i haven't really thought about that from five fifteen to increase it 

48.11 50.38 B: ah i don't know do you have any specific views on that 

50.64 57.80 A: i have because ah i i in my opinion it should be increased because ah the cost of living especially in new york 

58.06 61.42 A: is um has been increased tremendously 

60.80 62.09 B: oh that's true 

61.63 63.56 A: so they just ah 

63.64 65.44 A: raised ah the um 

65.93 71.55 A: cost of one ride on the subway and ah all the sale taxes on everything so 

68.56 69.73 B: (( oh that's true )) 

70.83 72.44 B: (( right right )) 

71.83 75.73 A: (( and ah it really hurts ah people who with ah )) 

75.97 83.02 A: with ah less income and ah immigrant and i am myself an immigrant from hungary actually 

78.35 79.18 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

81.34 82.20 B: right 

82.27 83.70 B: from hungary oh okay 

83.23 95.94 A: so i'm not from ah latin american country so i had the opportunity of ah great education in my country so i'm fortunate on that level but i know many people weren't that fortunate so they 

84.63 85.36 B: okay 

89.59 90.52 B: (( right mhm )) 

95.29 96.94 B: right right so 

95.99 97.53 A: they work in ah 

97.54 98.45 A: (( you know )) 

97.98 99.44 B: minimum wage right 

98.78 106.52 A: minimum wage like they work in kitchens and everything and they they are really ah the engine of ah of the economy 

100.75 101.81 B: mhm 

105.95 107.62 B: right right very hard work yeah 

107.19 116.10 A: yeah and i always i've always contemplated ah how come that people who work harder they they they get the least amount of money 

107.94 109.30 B: (( yeah i know that )) 

113.12 114.11 B: get less 

115.32 117.09 B: right right right 

116.44 121.10 A: and ah i've just watched a program on channel thirteen where they 

121.21 125.58 A: showed how wall street cheated so many people out of their money 

125.03 126.26 B: oh really 

125.65 129.62 A: yeah i mean the world com you know the world com you remember 

126.61 127.70 B: (( i didn't know )) 

128.68 130.56 B: right right right right 

129.78 131.63 A: and it was really a scam 

131.30 132.34 B: oh okay 

131.89 139.96 A: so they made millions meanwhile people with ah you know with average ah incomes or less than average they suffered 

133.20 134.45 B: right while the 

137.33 138.75 B: right right 

139.37 140.80 B: (( yeah they lost )) 

140.21 148.03 A: so i think the minimum wage should be increased at least to six dollars even that is not a lot of money if you come to think about it 

147.45 148.70 B: right 

148.04 153.71 A: six times eight well you know i should know but it is not too much you know 

153.10 156.40 B: right well i mean that's a big increase i don't know if they'd go that far but 

156.34 157.23 A: (( yeah ah on )) 

156.99 164.64 B: i mean that's a big jump from five fifty i don't know if that's possible to jump that high but i mean i agree with you i actually know a lot of people like that too who are 

163.94 165.92 A: a minimum wage yeah 

165.30 166.96 B: yeah i mean i 

165.93 174.02 A: there are a lot of baby sitters from hungary and they work for maybe they they got more than the minimum wage that's true but ah not too much 

173.77 175.21 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

174.60 177.78 A: and it's a hard work too to take care of these 

176.00 177.04 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

178.26 179.29 A: bad 

179.70 183.49 A: (( little babies you know [laughter] these children [laughter] you know )) 

180.85 182.26 B: (( [cough] [laughter] )) 

182.60 189.46 B: [laughter] yeah i mean i know a lot of ah i'm from india so there's actually a lot of immigrants coming in from there yeah 

187.86 199.09 A: oh really you from in- oh that's great 'cause i i like indian culture i'm not only saying this to impress you but it's true ah have you have you seen the movie what's that with beckham like 

189.59 190.87 B: yeah so [laughter] 

193.33 194.69 B: right 

198.54 200.46 B: oh yeah that's a very good movie 

200.15 202.07 A: twist it like beckham or what 

201.20 202.86 B: ah bend it like beckham 

202.23 206.31 A: bend it like beckham yeah that's a that's a great movie 

202.99 204.79 B: (( [laughter] yeah that's a funny movie )) 

205.82 208.21 B: yeah that's a funny movie so um 

207.90 212.66 A: so both of us come from immigrant cultures so we know that i mean 

210.09 211.53 B: yeah yeah so 

212.74 224.60 A: you know when we come here we we we want to prove that we are on a certain level we want to achieve more and ah for that to happen you need ah an income that can support that 

217.44 218.36 B: (( right mhm )) 

223.94 225.69 B: yeah definitely 

225.01 228.60 A: so that's that's my point on it 

227.97 231.04 B: yeah and i totally ag- i mean i i know a lot of ah 

231.06 242.73 B: friends who actually work ah more than one job you know so they're working how many hours like twenty hour days and getting minimum wage so just just to get by you know while other's just work you know 

240.07 241.25 A: yeah 

242.42 243.81 A: absolutely 

242.89 247.62 B: nine to five and live like a luxurious life and not even doing like hard work [noise] 

246.84 261.23 A: yeah so i think it's self evident that it should be i know it's ah the only problem is that um the economy's not so good so the business owners and the companies i mean companies usually don't pay minimum wages true but 

247.66 248.98 B: (( i mean yeah )) 

254.42 255.72 B: (( yeah it's weak yeah )) 

261.30 264.51 A: you know the employers are not in the 

264.68 270.83 A: in most cases they are not really able to do that they're not able to raise the minimum wage 

267.57 269.87 B: (( [noise] yeah i mean ah ah )) 

270.10 273.03 B: yeah obviously 'cause they have expenses or whatnot but ah 

272.19 282.19 A: because ah yeah so that's a problem but ah they should still find a way to to increase it anyway maybe the government could help of course not this one because they [laughter] 

274.95 276.47 B: yeah 

281.81 282.70 B: (( yeah )) 

282.14 289.36 A: th- they're in my opinion they don't really care about these people who who make a m- i mean i can be on record saying that because 

285.15 286.28 B: [laughter] 

288.71 290.02 B: right 

289.59 293.00 A: you know they just cut taxes for the rich 

292.56 294.25 B: right right i mean that yeah 

293.15 303.97 A: and it's trickle down economy which they don't work in the areas but they hope it's gonna work now i actually i don't think they ah hope that it's gonna work because they don't care but it's okay it's not okay but 

294.91 295.85 B: yeah 

298.10 299.15 B: (( right yeah )) 

304.12 307.78 A: so the minimum wage again and i'm gonna 

307.83 314.79 A: say it for the last time today [laughter] should be increased at least to six dollars an hour 

309.30 310.56 B: (( [noise] )) 

314.22 324.38 B: [laughter] i mean i agree it should be increased i don't know if it's possible to even th- i mean that's not possible but ah i ah i mean ideally i agree [noise] it should definitely be increased 

316.86 317.92 A: or more or 

318.52 319.67 A: more 

320.61 321.42 A: (( yeah i )) 

323.57 333.85 A: know it's a think it's on an ideal position because now that the economy's not good then it's not gonna happen at least it's very unlikely that it will happen 

328.23 329.76 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

330.35 331.34 B: yeah 

333.10 335.64 B: yeah i doubt it would happen but 

335.13 336.27 A: (( but ah )) 

336.43 341.26 B: yeah if i mean there's no argument on my side [laughter] [noise] totally agree with you 

337.56 338.27 A: (( no )) 

339.44 340.47 A: yeah 

340.86 344.59 A: so you know a lot of people who ah who work minimum wage 

343.83 349.63 B: [noise] [noise] um yeah i know a lot actually i go to a temple in queens flushing yeah 

347.82 348.99 A: oh really 

349.02 350.79 A: i used to live in queens 

350.23 353.71 B: oh okay yeah i i used to live there i actually grew up in queens 

353.36 354.42 A: (( oh )) 

353.86 360.54 B: and um so i know like a lot of immigrants actually come to there like a lot of recent immigrants especially come there 

359.91 362.44 A: yeah lot of koreans there 

360.39 375.31 B: um sundays every sunday yeah and we get together so i know a lot even like just friends of mine who are like early twenties you know it's not great i mean even if they have a good education from india it's not really accepted here as much you know they still have to go through it here 

368.52 369.47 A: uh-huh 

374.89 386.94 A: yeah i know i know that exactly because i know so many people who have degree in education in hungary even doctors and they they don't really accept that or lawyers ah lawyers i can understand because the laws are different but 

375.33 376.46 B: they just ah 

379.50 380.94 B: right right 

381.16 382.12 B: right 

383.31 384.89 B: yeah so they end up 

386.26 387.98 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

387.14 389.76 A: so they have to go through that 

389.11 395.80 B: all again so while they're doing schooling they're working hours during the day going to school at night just trying to 

390.04 390.95 A: yeah 

394.09 402.89 A: yeah so they work in restaurants sometimes like here or there delis or some- whatever they can make money sometimes they get the minimum wage 

396.32 398.47 B: yeah at everything i mean 

399.30 401.57 B: yeah exactly 

402.32 404.73 B: yeah a lot often i mean a lot of 'em have 

403.54 409.80 A: it's very humiliating too because in their respective or or in their previously countries they were 

407.39 408.29 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

409.42 410.87 B: very respected yeah 

410.24 419.28 A: top earners sometimes and ah now they have to start all over again and they have to do these jobs that are they wouldn't have done it in ah in their own countries 

411.04 411.89 B: yeah 

413.38 414.38 B: yeah 

415.63 416.99 B: right 

418.54 423.40 B: no they would never have done it yeah i mean where they come from they're very well off actually so 

420.49 421.47 A: it would have 

422.96 424.07 A: yeah 

423.41 425.70 B: but i mean yeah 

424.95 432.51 A: so i think this minimum wage i- is actually intertwined with the intertwined with the immigrant experience too 

429.30 430.00 B: [noise] 

432.06 433.09 B: right 

432.49 446.18 A: 'cause i've never heard i mean i haven't heard about too many you know native born americans who are actually having the minimum wage although they they have it ah in mcdonalds and stuff like that like for the young people 

443.97 445.18 B: (( yeah yeah yeah for )) 

446.26 448.66 B: more ah yeah minority classes 

447.12 457.79 A: yeah i think it would be good to raise the minimum wage for for these youngsters to to see that the to see that their work is actually worth something 

457.13 458.72 B: yeah exactly 

458.05 465.83 A: because ah i've heard it many times that they say they're not gonna go to mcdonalds to work there because they get enough money 

463.20 464.18 B: right 

465.13 468.55 B: right and they actually work they have to work non stop almost you know 

467.87 473.46 A: that's that's exactly my point that the the hardest ah manual works 

469.52 470.71 B: yeah 

471.86 474.32 B: work ah yeah exactly 

473.52 475.18 A: are the least paid 

474.55 476.00 B: yeah 

475.51 487.30 A: and they are the actual people who do something i mean ah they they do somethings that you can you can um [lipsmack] you can weight that you see there are certain things that [sigh] these people do 

487.02 488.08 B: right right 

487.49 490.90 A: like many people in in wall street they all they do is 

490.99 499.43 A: re- they are reorganizing money and it could be very helpful but many many times it's just not a productive job it's ah it's 

493.00 494.04 B: yeah 

496.95 498.08 B: yeah i mean 

498.49 500.32 B: yeah it's not as as 

499.48 504.61 A: just a job w- where they just pretend to do something and they get a lot of money 

502.71 506.65 B: [laughter] yeah i mean yeah i've i've worked in a 

505.81 507.74 A: i think i think that 

506.99 509.53 B: (( [noise] i've worked in that kind of environment so i know yeah )) 

508.66 513.67 A: yeah so it's really i think that we we have one more minute so 

512.97 515.51 B: (( mm oh really yeah )) 

514.08 519.20 A: yeah 'cause i'm checking it but i you know it's it's an interesting ah subject because i've 

515.81 516.90 B: [laughter] 

518.34 519.78 B: yeah very good 

519.04 529.62 A: been thinking about it a lot because when i worked in a restaurant i saw these mexican immigrants working in a restaurant and they really worked hard and for twelve hours they made it 

520.11 521.12 B: (( yeah right mhm )) 

528.38 530.95 B: yeah and they're very hard workers they're very good with 

530.28 531.61 A: yeah [sigh] 

531.11 533.24 B: like they don't like yeah 

532.48 544.35 A: they made sixty dollars for for twelve hours i mean they were actually probably illegal but [sigh] and thats another question that um many people you know they don't have the necessary papers so they 

535.23 536.20 B: yeah 

543.73 544.88 B: right 

544.27 548.52 A: they are cheated out of their job i mean out of their salary 

545.37 547.29 B: (( yeah right right right )) 

547.95 549.29 B: right right 

548.66 550.07 A: so it's pretty bad 

549.71 551.22 B: (( yeah that happens a lot too )) 

550.81 553.30 A: it happens a lot okay so 

553.46 556.30 A: that's all i could say about this particular 

555.13 556.31 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

556.39 557.65 A: (( i think ah )) 

557.77 561.63 A: we have thirty seconds or something so 

558.30 559.95 B: (( yeah probably should be finished yeah )) 

561.91 565.80 A: (( ah i hope you gonna have a nice weekend )) 

564.48 566.53 B: mm [laughter] yeah you too 

566.11 567.23 A: (( and ah )) 

566.58 570.79 B: it's good to get to talk to someone from new york [laughter] brooklyn [laughter] 

569.36 570.32 A: yeah 

570.65 571.69 A: great 

571.11 575.53 B: but um yeah it's good to actually hear to same side from different cultures you know 

575.60 576.58 A: yeah 

575.83 578.11 B: different cultures going through the same stuff 

577.86 585.44 A: yeah of course i mean it is immigrant country many people forget that i mean those who were born here 

578.53 579.34 B: so 

581.24 582.14 B: yeah 

582.85 583.44 B: (( yeah )) 

584.86 586.03 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

585.46 588.52 A: their forefathers had to go through a lot too 

587.70 590.38 B: yeah yeah i agree i mean i was i mean 

589.96 591.59 A: and they forget this 

591.15 592.85 B: yeah i agree [noise] 

592.40 596.18 A: they think you know it's been like this forever but it's not true of course 

595.80 598.84 B: yeah especially at school here i see a lot of ah 

598.96 599.90 A: (( yeah i mean in new york ))
