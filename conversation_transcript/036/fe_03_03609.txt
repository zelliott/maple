15.20 16.12 A: right 

16.02 16.98 B: yes 

16.60 21.01 A: all right and and i don't know that much about the minimum [laughter] wage do you the increase 

20.05 24.72 B: okay they're yes there's been an increase i i thought it was um it's five fifteen 

24.41 25.41 A: okay 

24.84 29.94 B: and so we're supposed to talk and see if it's um we think it's sufficient if it's enough 

29.88 30.82 A: right 

30.18 39.42 B: and i don't think that it's enough five fifteen at forty hours a week is like two hundred dollars and that's before taxes 

38.89 40.14 A: yeah 

39.52 43.83 B: and even a single person that's not enough even to support a single person 

43.54 46.47 A: so that's five so what was it before the increase do you know 

47.18 53.53 B: see i think that's a oh i think i don't think there's been an increase in a few years i think that's the um 

53.28 55.26 A: it's just stayed at five fifteen 

53.59 56.39 B: (( i think yeah right )) 

55.71 57.98 A: wow it really does seem low 

57.78 59.99 B: yeah that that's really low 

58.82 64.30 A: i mean you know to think what it what it what would be a minimum wage mcdonald's probably pays minimum wage to start 

64.56 73.78 B: well actually i don't think so i don't um no because i know like taco bell they're they're they were starting out at almost nine dollars 

66.96 67.83 A: no 

73.83 75.85 B: and i thought this was really cool 

75.45 76.98 A: (( yeah i know i do too )) 

75.96 76.95 B: i saw 

77.06 82.64 B: i saw a sign that said ah it was a starting i always thought they made minimum wage but no 

82.30 84.27 A: (( who makes minimum wage [laughter] )) 

82.65 83.49 B: (( so )) 

85.72 90.06 A: i mean even baby you know what you've got to think about it is i i don't know are are you in chicago 

86.22 87.20 B: (( um and um )) 

89.91 91.47 B: no i'm in ohio 

91.03 99.61 A: okay well i'm in chicago and i i don't know about there but our babysitters here for one child start at about six dollars an hour i mean that's to come to your home in the evening 

97.59 98.75 B: okay 

99.54 107.03 A: eat your snacks watch the television [laughter] and put your bed kid to bed maybe and and they're teenagers 

102.19 103.77 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

106.79 108.15 B: (( yeah )) 

107.25 109.13 A: and it's six dollars an hour 

109.51 113.67 B: well apparently some people still make minimum 

110.18 111.49 A: (( you know and then an )) 

111.70 114.03 A: adult ten dollars an hour mm mm 

114.04 115.12 B: (( yes )) 

115.23 121.00 B: yes some people still make minimum wage i'm thinking maybe some of the other like maybe factories 

121.49 124.17 B: maybe minimum wage i'm not really sure 

124.88 129.01 A: i'm not either i'd always assumed it was you know i guess that i'd always assumed it was like 

125.12 125.79 B: (( so )) 

129.02 130.32 A: fast food 

130.30 133.15 B: no no actually my friend she works at um 

133.32 145.61 B: what's the name i forget them clo- it's a clothing store we don't have one in ohio but i um they have one in wisconsin and she makes minimum wage and her checks are like one eighty and she's a single person every um two weeks 

145.34 147.56 A: yeah that's not enough you know 

146.58 148.74 B: (( you know it's it's not enough )) 

148.15 162.76 A: yeah it's not enough it needs to be at least probably around seven eight bucks i mean yeah 'cause if you figure if you're a single person by the time you take out taxes if you have a child you've got to pay childcare you know we said two hundred dollars a week 

152.29 153.97 B: i think eight dollars 

162.59 163.78 B: yeah 

163.35 167.09 A: eight hundred dollars well you you certainly couldn't live on it 

167.31 173.82 B: and then the you have to think about um food and ah gas gone forty hours a week 

174.19 179.64 B: and and then you only bring home a hundred and eighty that's that's that's that's not enough 

179.49 187.53 A: yeah no it's not like e- especially like i said you've got childcare your rent food you really you could absolutely not live on minimum wage 

187.49 188.60 B: (( right )) 

187.57 189.08 A: but that's the idea 

189.32 195.24 A: but maybe it maybe maybe it's good in a sense that you know at least companies are told they can't go below something 

195.96 202.99 A: but on the other hand try and trying to find somebody that would work for you for a minimum wage and make money is probably you know there's not that many people maybe 

203.98 206.17 B: (( mm i don't know )) 

205.93 207.78 A: i don't either [laughter] 

206.93 210.05 B: (( [laughter] i don't know )) 

209.74 211.53 A: (( [laughter] )) 

210.49 214.53 B: and i know like a couple of years ago i think that it was when um 

214.59 222.37 B: [mn] when um bush was about to be president they were talk- maybe it was way before about increasing the minimum wage and they voted against it 

223.24 228.00 A: i can't imagine it being lower than five what did they say five dollars and fifteen cents 

223.39 224.34 B: so 

224.91 226.59 B: [laughter] 

227.53 232.57 B: well they wanted to raise it so they voted no not to raise it but to keep it the same 

232.52 235.66 A: oh those congressmen needed to make more money 

233.49 234.71 B: right 

235.26 236.48 B: (( yes )) 

235.80 239.42 A: [laughter] but on the other hand i wonder how much 

236.72 237.72 B: yeah 

239.99 248.80 A: you know by the time you pay if i don't know if health benefits are involved in that ah if it's full time work or whatever but you know i wonder if some of these businesses can afford to pay more 

249.49 251.98 A: and i guess it depends on what kind of business it is 

252.49 259.16 B: i think that they can 'cause a lot of people who are um a lot of the jobs that offer minimum wage they don't offer benefits 

259.04 259.94 A: (( [noise] mm [noise] )) 

260.07 261.08 B: so 

260.63 268.31 A: that's true and then you know so they ought to be encouraged to pay more does everyone have to pay i mean you everyone every business has to pay minimum wage 

261.82 262.55 B: mm 

269.04 270.96 B: yes yes 

271.22 274.37 B: [noise] yes that's true that's that's the minimum that they can pay 

273.97 275.60 A: okay yeah 

274.93 278.12 B: so it's against the law to pay anything below that 

277.82 280.19 A: all right all right no 

278.80 280.73 B: (( mhm hm hm )) 

280.92 283.72 A: what else can you think of [laughter] 

282.29 283.44 B: [laughter] 

285.78 289.38 A: um we could name companies that might be paying minimum wage 

286.12 286.88 B: so 

290.46 296.97 B: i think some of the grocery stores they might pay well at minimum wage some of the daycares bankers 

290.59 291.90 A: (( what )) 

294.17 295.60 A: like baggers 

297.03 299.36 A: ah no no no like the baggers yeah 

297.69 302.67 B: oh baggers the baggers yeah yeah minimum wage for baggers um 

302.25 308.80 A: it would be scary to think of yeah i'm sure you're right about the daycare workers and that's that's a little scary that you would have people 

309.32 312.37 A: that you i mean somebody that a housekeeper 

312.53 316.75 A: or a cleaning lady in chicago costs about sixty dollars minimum 

316.79 317.59 B: okay 

317.18 320.16 A: and she might work four or five hours 

319.80 320.87 B: okay 

320.32 323.90 A: you know that's you know more than our daycare workers make 

323.68 324.76 B: yeah 

324.33 328.54 A: for the most part so people will pay more to have their house cleaned than their child watched 

328.10 329.16 B: (( yes )) 

329.39 332.23 A: [laughter] which will you know is kind of crazy 

329.58 330.86 B: (( yeah so )) 

332.66 336.59 B: oh that that is crazy that's um that's like teachers they don't make 

336.85 340.09 B: as much as ah an entertainer 

339.80 341.62 A: right right 

340.99 341.84 B: so 

341.81 347.64 A: yeah of course that's it it it it's it's crazy and it's skewed but i guess it's what the public's willing to pay i 

347.61 348.68 B: right 

348.49 349.51 A: (( know )) 

350.58 355.82 B: so at at at minimum wage okay so you think about um taxes 

350.80 351.47 A: (( so )) 

355.83 360.43 B: and you think about um if you have an apartment the average apartment 

360.62 367.69 B: without um living probably ah being homeless i would say it's maybe like four hundred dollars a month 

366.83 368.58 A: oh at least yeah 

367.96 374.80 B: at at least so then how do you make minimum wage and then pay for um transportation if you have a car 

374.83 378.73 B: at apartment 'cause like minimum wage if you're getting like let's say 

378.88 382.66 B: let's say a hundred and seventy five um every week 

383.31 386.13 B: so that that that's just it's not enough [mn] 

385.82 396.19 A: yeah you can't i mean you can't do it you can't do it and live alone and do it much less living you know i would assume that a lot of people that fall into that category are single parents 

396.04 396.92 B: (( yes )) 

396.50 398.36 A: there's just no there's no way 

398.54 405.82 A: and and and unless you live someplace that's very rural and you can walk to work and don't need a car and you know [laughter] 

403.47 404.72 B: [laughter] 

404.97 409.37 B: (( and you can and you can eat while you're at work the free food that they have because you )) 

408.25 412.25 A: all right maybe you can pitch a tent in you know somebody's back yard 

410.96 413.94 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

412.70 417.19 A: but an apartment here for four hundred i mean it wouldn't it would um it 

417.42 420.76 A: would definitely probably you know be a stretch 

420.78 421.89 B: yeah 

421.02 425.17 A: and then even if you're going to take even if you're going to take public transportation 

425.36 429.55 A: you're still looking at you know two dollars four dollars round trip 

429.97 431.38 A: you know that's another 

431.34 432.93 B: (( [noise] )) 

431.87 433.69 A: wh- what do you think that is 

434.37 435.53 A: (( that's ah )) 

435.61 439.09 B: yeah [noise] [noise] [laughter] yes i'm still here [noise] 

436.73 437.55 A: hello 

438.55 440.11 A: okay um 

440.24 444.56 A: so that's another so that's you know four dollars a day times five days a week 

444.84 446.62 A: for just the transportation 

446.58 447.90 B: yeah 

447.30 454.51 A: you know so that's that adds up plus you're eating out when you're working or you're taking your lunch but you've still got to buy the food to make it 

454.27 455.32 B: right 

455.03 458.02 A: and ah i guess you'd have to be very frugal 

458.45 465.15 B: i think that they should um adjust um the minimum wage according to um like the cost to live 

464.99 466.07 A: yeah 

465.94 468.72 B: because depending on where you're living at 

468.70 483.36 B: i mean i guess it is i guess the jobs go like just not the minimum wage usually jobs on average you know you make depending on um might how much it costs to live like my friend lives in georgia and they make a little less than we make down here for the same job and that's just 

484.42 487.70 B: you know um you know where you live in the costs 

487.83 495.00 B: but minimum wage you know there are still people who who do just pay the minimum and you're always going to find somebody who will be 

496.86 497.89 B: so 

497.78 502.64 A: [mn] you just out on me um yeah you know i think that that's um 

502.93 506.46 A: yeah is it the same i i guess that's a good point it's the same everywhere 

506.33 507.28 B: (( yes the )) 

507.64 510.49 B: minimum wage is the same everywhere 

507.71 509.37 A: that's crazy 

510.44 519.96 A: you know i mean if you live in i mean my uncle lives in fort paine alabama and i can assure you that it's cheaper to live in fort paine alabama than it is where in the city of chicago 

519.76 520.78 B: right 

520.43 525.71 A: i mean that's that's you're absolutely right it needs to be adjusted by location 

525.78 526.73 B: (( yes )) 

526.52 528.66 A: you know at the very least you 

528.51 529.69 B: yeah 

529.16 533.21 A: know and could take into account what the cost of living in that place might be 

533.57 536.99 A: you know but they're always slow to regulate what people can can do 

537.06 538.57 B: (( yeah it it it )) 

537.89 541.41 A: and ah what do you think it should be what would you what would you put it at 

541.16 543.09 B: i think eight dollars 

542.83 544.30 A: that sounds about right 

544.55 554.13 B: is is sufficient 'cause the eight dollars just that's still not a lot that's only twenty ah that's like three hundred and twenty dollars a week right you got three hundred and twenty a week 

554.10 560.95 B: or forty if you're working forty hours and and that's still not a lot if if you have children because with the with the minimum wage now 

554.16 554.98 A: right 

557.29 558.38 A: right 

561.76 567.92 B: i mean if you're other than single that means with no children i mean you could possibly make it if you work two jobs 

567.73 568.63 A: mhm 

568.60 573.02 B: but if you if you have a child and that's where you become like the working poor 

572.85 573.89 A: right 

574.06 577.98 B: so at five fifteen i mean what can you really do 

578.40 581.20 A: yeah even at eight dollars that's going to be tough 

579.22 580.11 B: working 

581.10 582.22 B: it it is 

581.76 588.39 A: with a k- if you've got to support it by yourself you're going to live better but as a single parent you're certainly not 

588.36 590.33 B: (( no it it )) 

589.38 592.12 A: you know you're going to you're still really going to be struggling 

593.36 597.92 A: oh but i guess that that i don't i don't know that you could get it much higher than eight dollars an hour 

593.41 594.39 B: (( yeah )) 

597.92 599.89 B: no i i think and they'll be
