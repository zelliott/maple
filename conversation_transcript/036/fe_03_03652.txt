23.58 24.55 B: good 

25.41 27.69 B: so we're supposed to talk about minimum wage 

27.12 29.03 A: yes what do you think 

27.97 28.77 B: [laughter] 

29.29 35.48 B: um i feel that minimum wage should be increased because the work that 

35.60 38.17 B: laborers do is worth it 

38.44 46.95 A: well yes and inflation keeps on going up and minimum wage does not um cover anybody's expenses any more 

46.76 48.14 B: very true i mean 

47.48 51.31 A: it's too low for what the cost of living is now 

48.68 49.75 B: right 

50.70 58.07 B: exactly people have families and they're they're trying to live on five dollar an hour jobs and it just doesn't work like that anymore 

57.79 62.92 A: right even in families that are just um with one child or just two people 

63.07 65.21 A: um minimum wage is not 

65.43 70.26 A: doesn't meet the standards the appropriate standards of living here in this country 

70.17 71.93 B: right it's not sufficient 

72.74 77.11 B: to for housing and transportation and 

76.86 82.01 A: right i mean if you have a family and children and you are planning for college tuition 

82.62 85.90 A: you know it doesn't it doesn't help 

84.81 88.14 B: exactly it makes people struggle their whole lives 

87.60 88.69 A: right 

88.65 91.80 B: and children shouldn't have to be raised like that 

91.61 92.50 A: right 

92.20 94.04 B: making ends meet each month 

93.86 99.97 A: plus taxes are going up i'm now in this state i'm in florida the taxes went up seven percent 

100.26 106.20 A: you know and i mean taxes go up inflation goes up everything's more expensive 

106.21 107.11 A: um 

107.12 115.11 A: if minimum wage is still at five um the only the only amount it goes up is about what five percent 

114.92 115.83 B: (( uh-huh )) 

116.20 119.66 A: a year and taxes go up twenty three percent a year 

120.73 122.68 B: exactly it's just not 

122.75 124.47 B: it just doesn't balance out 

123.82 126.74 A: no it doesn't balance 

125.39 135.18 B: no not at all and i just don't think it's fair that like people that work in hot kitchens all day making fast food only make five dollars an hour when i make 

135.38 140.13 B: i personally make six fifty an hour just i i lifeguard during the summers 

140.41 145.40 B: and i make six fifty just like sitting there watching people 

145.48 146.93 A: (( right right )) 

146.15 151.68 B: when these people are working very hard to make a living and they don't even make that 

151.59 159.74 A: right and there's a lot of companies that do not pay minimum wage they i mean here in this state there's still um factories that are still paying 

151.78 152.78 B: which is not 

159.89 163.50 A: four seventy five for starters they're not they're going against the 

163.83 165.17 A: labor laws 

165.24 170.10 A: and you cannot do anything about it you cannot complain because they just lay you off 

170.44 171.72 B: (( that's what they do )) 

170.47 174.52 A: or they've um they have this other program here that 

174.55 176.76 A: if you work um 

177.91 182.57 A: if you work in a factory and you produce more than a certain amount 

182.87 188.94 A: ah of whatever is required they raise you so it's like a commission deal 

188.96 189.83 B: (( uh-huh )) 

189.03 192.19 A: you start with four dollars but um 

192.27 205.82 A: most people make about five dollars an hour a month after they meet their quota and that's not fair i mean they they tell you you can do it you can end up making seven fifty to nine dollars an hour and when you go to the interviews or 

205.88 207.16 A: when um 

207.54 213.47 A: you you speak to people there they tell you that it's very hard even for sales people 

211.89 212.69 B: yeah 

213.55 215.82 A: i've seen it at stores and um 

215.84 224.85 A: clothing stores retail stores they work based on commission when they calculate their hours and calculate the salary that they're making 

225.05 228.06 A: they're making less than um five fifty an hour 

228.31 229.80 B: that's ridiculous 

229.56 232.64 A: yeah it's way below minimum wage also 

232.65 234.07 B: most definitely 

233.66 239.25 A: and our unemployment is so high and we have a lot of illegal people working 

239.27 243.99 A: for less than that just as long as they have a job you know it doesn't help 

242.08 243.09 B: mhm 

244.15 245.25 B: exactly 

245.77 255.28 B: and it's just i don't know it's just ridiculous how our economy is and the cost that they expect everybody to be able to afford the cost of living in today when i 

255.38 258.18 B: mean families can't even put food on the table 

258.15 259.12 A: right 

260.30 261.08 B: so 

260.88 262.28 A: and medicine's 

262.53 265.29 A: expensive transportation 

265.05 266.10 B: (( mhm )) 

265.49 269.70 A: if you have kids in school you have to pay daycare and you have to pay 

269.72 278.79 A: um school buses and babysitters if you work um on the weekends or evenings um five fifteen an hour 

279.16 280.26 A: it doesn't it 

280.28 282.30 A: doesn't budget out 

282.31 285.40 B: mhm and college education is going up 

284.94 289.72 A: right they're cutting a lot of expenses when it comes to education this year 

285.98 286.68 B: it's 

287.85 288.88 B: exactly 

289.55 293.64 B: mhm even state colleges state universities 

293.40 294.96 A: right 

293.93 295.48 B: they're classes are 

295.67 298.69 B: almost as high as some private universities 

299.20 304.87 B: and unless kids get some kids get scholarships it's very difficult for them to even go to college 

304.54 305.44 A: right 

306.07 309.51 B: and that's sad that some kids will be deprived of that but 

310.58 311.67 B: i guess that's 

311.75 313.88 B: part of living in this country 

316.35 317.10 B: so 

317.28 320.92 B: i think personally five fifteen's too low for a minimum wage 

320.64 321.42 A: (( right yes )) 

321.59 323.13 A: i believe that 

321.78 324.39 B: i think it should be about six dollars [laughter] 

323.86 326.67 A: at least at least and even 

324.92 325.70 B: (( mhm )) 

326.85 329.97 A: even that would be a struggle but it would be better 

329.73 330.92 B: oh yeah 

330.29 337.21 A: i mean some states but if you live in california or new york at six fifty six dollars is not going to help you 

337.04 338.22 B: no it's not 

337.44 339.58 A: those are very expensive states 

339.44 340.41 B: very 

339.61 340.44 A: um 

340.67 343.94 A: seven fifty is considered minimum there 

343.35 344.34 B: mhm 

343.95 353.84 A: 'cause i've been to california and i've seen their prices compared to florida um maybe six dollars here even though it's borderline with poverty um 

353.95 361.13 A: the struggle is not as hard as if it's below six dollars but people have to consider also the um 

357.75 358.72 B: uh-huh 

361.65 367.44 A: the number of people in a family um latin people tend to have a lot of children 

367.88 375.32 A: and um usually one after the other so they're all under growing age you don't have kids working while the other ones are 

375.33 383.82 A: are still you know going to school you have parents working to support their kids and raise their kids and if you have more than two children 

381.62 382.42 B: right 

383.93 385.99 A: at six dollars an hour 

386.09 389.68 A: both of you it's it's not going to balance out 

389.55 390.59 B: right 

390.72 391.54 A: (( you know )) 

390.86 397.44 B: i lived in los angeles for about five years and the cost of living there is just phenomenal 

397.75 399.08 A: where were you living 

399.17 401.38 B: los angeles california 

399.93 402.73 A: los ang yes i lived in culver city 

402.52 403.76 B: oh really 

403.24 409.12 A: yes and it's very expensive compared to florida very very expensive everything 

404.09 404.99 B: yeah 

406.91 408.06 B: oh yes 

408.77 412.09 B: i live in texas now and it's much cheaper 

412.88 419.80 B: much i was in a i was in los angeles the big city and it was so expensive and now i live in a small town in texas and it's 

419.81 420.99 B: much different 

420.93 422.40 A: mhm 

421.61 425.77 B: in many ways i mean minimum wage here i mean you're lucky 

425.83 432.68 B: some small town restaurants they're lucky to make waitresses are lucky to make two fifty an hour then plus tips 

432.56 437.90 A: well here in florida um at a restaurant if you're working as a waitress or a um 

438.05 439.49 A: busboy or 

439.52 448.53 A: um i don't know a um just cleaning people the cleaning service they make two dollars an hour plus tips 

443.81 444.74 B: mhm 

449.27 456.20 A: and according to them you're supposed to balance out at least five fifty to seven dollars an hour at the end of the week 

456.38 468.88 A: but when you when you have um the problems that this country has had in the last two years and you don't have the flow of clientele that you had before 

469.29 476.35 A: you know and business is super slow you're not going to balance out to six or seven or even sometimes 

476.53 481.50 A: these people are making four or four fifty an hour at in south beach 

481.83 491.65 A: and um and they were only working about twenty hours a week because there was no demand for their services after september eleven 

491.67 492.68 B: right 

492.26 501.67 A: so um that affected you know a lot of restaurants a lot of restaurants had to close or a lot of people had to quit or get two jobs and then you you don't 

503.05 512.71 A: if you're working two jobs um eventually you're going to get tired and you're not going to perform correctly in either one of them 

507.95 508.89 B: right 

513.02 525.65 A: but you're going to struggle and you're going to work two jobs and work seven days a week because you need the money to pay rent i mean at the beach a one bedroom apartment is about eight hundred and fifty dollars a month just the one bedroom 

524.21 525.11 B: wow 

525.92 531.05 A: you know and and then food at the beach is much more expensive than it is at the city 

531.32 532.54 A: (( so )) 

532.66 534.59 A: at five fifty or 

535.14 540.63 A: at six or seven or whatever it is in it doesn't work before before september eleven 

541.11 546.52 A: even if you had to share the tips among the bartender the waitress and the busboy 

546.69 548.13 A: they were making 

548.31 550.68 A: about nine to ten dollars an hour 

550.61 551.52 B: (( uh huh )) 

551.28 555.75 A: but after september eleven they were not making five dollars an hour 

556.27 557.20 B: wow 

556.67 570.36 A: and i feel a lot of people um just i mean they were extremely tired by the end of the evening working two jobs seven days a week just struggling to hold on and survive and then eventually they left they left the state 

570.57 572.49 A: a lot of people moved to 

572.59 576.98 A: nevada to texas to oregon or whatever 

577.17 581.26 A: they were told that um the economy was a little less expensive 

580.88 581.99 B: mhm 

581.74 589.04 A: you know a lot of people gave up these are college students that were working at the beach trying to maintain an apartment and go to college here 

589.22 596.66 A: that had to either stop school for a year or move out you know leave and go somewhere else 

595.41 596.51 B: (( mhm )) 

596.73 598.91 A: you know and it was sad to see 

599.00 599.95 A: (( people you ))
