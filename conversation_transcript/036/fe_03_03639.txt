5.20 6.29 A: yes 

6.16 7.48 B: oh okay 

6.72 9.50 A: [laughter] th- i'm james 

7.80 8.88 B: right 

9.52 12.87 B: i'm doug right are you in the city manhattan or new york 

10.22 14.71 A: [laughter] no i'm in texas 

14.45 18.09 B: oh oh okay 'cause i got somebody from brooklyn last time 

17.46 20.59 A: [laughter] this is my first time to do this so [laughter] 

19.56 27.90 B: oh oh okay yeah there was some have you had problems getting through by the way with the recording 'cause i it took me about ten minutes to get through but that's 

28.14 30.79 B: not the topic but [laughter] 

29.42 37.76 A: no m- m- my wife signed me up for this and i wasn't expecting the call so i [laughter] 

33.92 38.00 B: oh oh okay so um i i guess 

38.26 51.90 B: i guess i guess we're supposed to go to the question the minimum wage h- h- h- yeah how do you feel about it i i ha- well i'm pretty much for it but i have a little reservation i don't think it should be if you can have a minimum wage i think it should be higher but uh 

41.02 43.25 A: (( right )) 

47.56 48.40 A: oh 

51.66 59.34 A: well i i've got sort of mixed reactions about it i grew up when there wasn't anything minimum wage and uh 

57.26 58.55 B: mhm 

59.43 64.10 A: you know like they paid you what you was worth i thought of course you're 

65.14 66.09 B: mhm 

65.42 69.11 A: i'll be sixty one in october and uh 

67.21 68.40 B: mhm 

69.41 78.36 A: and i know you'll there are so many hm so many people that uh yeah some companies wouldn't wanna pay you now unless they're forced to 

78.15 79.43 B: mhm 

78.85 80.11 A: and uh 

81.06 85.26 A: but uh as far as having a national minimum wage uh 

87.13 91.43 A: it ends up costing you and me and everybody else more money 

90.10 96.54 B: mm right and that well the only problems i have a- which sound similar i think to yours is that uh 

96.71 107.90 B: some people made the argument not necessarily all republicans but mostly that uh some companies may not have the money to give a minimum wage to workers so they won't hire anybody at all 

107.50 108.61 A: that's right 

107.87 114.64 B: you know and that's a concern but uh still you know the cost of living is going way up 

114.66 128.85 B: you know especially in new york i mean i'm sure you hear what's happening with the subway fare and the uh rents are go- gonna go sky high it looks like and uh water you're gonna pay more for now and uh it it's very difficult to survive 

129.05 135.75 B: so i mean it if jobs are allowed to exploit you on the other hand they'll pay you for maybe two dollars an hour 

135.42 136.45 A: you're right 

135.63 144.34 B: you know and they do i mean i'm a state worker i'm not working now but i know that they uh put people in jobs which are not in their title 

144.31 157.15 B: and you get paid uh maybe uh twenty five thousand dollars a year to to pay what a thirty five thousand dollar a year should pay you know so they do that their they do exploit people that i know 

157.05 158.25 A: (( well i )) 

157.09 159.82 B: and that's the main problem but uh 

160.07 167.64 B: you know of course i mean maybe they should uh think of maybe tax credits or something for companies that hire more people at the at the 

167.76 171.15 B: maybe a certain wage or maybe the government could pay the difference 

171.05 172.60 A: (( well )) 

171.74 176.01 B: something like that but of course i- it's gotta come outta taxes but we could 

176.00 182.68 B: i see this country could do it 'cause w- w- w- this country wastes a lot of money i know the city i'm living in is wasting tons of money 

181.68 183.05 A: (( [noise] )) 

182.68 196.16 B: you know i mean this is like i see it every day i mean some there are street lights on here in the middle of the day when daylight hours and they have streetlights i mean you know if there's no money how come it's burning those streetlights and you can see perfectly without them you know 

188.80 189.91 A: oh yeah 

196.14 203.60 B: so um yeah i mean i i think they should raise it but i think they should i think the government should take more of a responsibility 

204.29 208.05 B: and make up a difference like maybe make it make it six dollars an hour 

207.58 211.00 A: well i i i was a union man all the time i was working 

210.42 212.43 B: mhm yeah sure 

211.02 220.20 A: and and you know if it hadn't been for the for the union well uh we we wouldn't have been paid what we was paid 

218.84 227.51 B: mhm right the unions have led the way in terms of pay and i'll tell you one thing they didn't help me in terms of my job situation they won't help people with uh 

227.60 236.00 B: making a job better for you that that i can tell you at least with the state new york state but uh they do they do fight for uh 

231.27 233.03 A: (( wh- wh- )) 

236.08 244.55 B: [lipsmack] for the minimum wage and th- f- it to be increase and everything you know and uh yeah no i i agree with you are you working now though

528.33 529.18 A: no 

536.16 544.95 B: south or something maybe texas maybe the carolinas or something 'cause i mean the cost of living is cheaper the climate is better i think the people are probably friendlier
