404.03 405.53 B: dime a dozen huh 

407.81 412.80 A: one of the reasons that uh there's so many illegal immigrants here is because uh 

413.32 417.53 A: there's so many jobs that they can't fill unless they use the illegals 

417.65 422.21 B: seems like there's some kin- some kind of imbalance here [laughter] you got 

421.39 425.50 A: yeah i mean you know you got i have to laugh because it's you know y- 

425.80 428.37 B: and people were bitching when there is that

452.69 465.11 B: [laughter] i must live in one of the parts of the country that must be one of the last ones they haven't invaded yet but you know maybe it's the four- fourteen feet of snow that we get a year or something that scares them away i don't know 

464.33 467.78 A: yeah that could be i guess there's not too many in maine either 

465.66 466.68 B: [laughter] 

466.92 470.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

469.64 477.57 A: but i mean we got the largest uh we got the largest community of el salvadorians and guatemalans outside of the countries 

478.09 479.11 B: really 

478.71 481.48 A: yeah they got they got um 

479.34 480.55 B: this is [laughter]

503.47 505.65 B: (( kinda feeding their families and stuff is )) 

508.04 512.66 B: see and that's even more amazing because they're trying to live there where it costs an arm and a leg 

512.93 519.15 B: and they're trying to do it w- you know making that much money and yet they're still sending money home so 

518.18 523.74 A: yeah i mean i i i even had a couple of crews working for me one time 

524.19 534.21 A: where they were from the same little town and they'd alternate six months one group'd come up and then six months uh the other group would come up and relieve 'em 

533.80 535.09 B: [laughter]

558.32 560.47 A: (( [laughter] )) 

560.75 565.10 A: it's n- well you know the biggest problem with that is mexico 

565.45 572.58 A: is getting [laughter] across mexico they don't have any problem getting through u._s. it's when they get into mexico one guy was telling me uh 

572.80 580.66 A: that he drives down and what he does is he stops at o- there's a he said i don't know whether it's in el paso or somewhere there's a crossman
