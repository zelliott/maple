0.40 1.53 A: hello 

0.43 2.71 B: hi how are you 

2.48 3.62 A: good how are you 

3.54 5.53 B: fine thank you my name's adam 

5.31 8.01 A: uh my name's adam too that's gonna be confusing 

7.83 9.30 B: isn't that strange 

8.98 10.71 A: [laughter] 

9.85 11.01 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

11.57 13.14 A: so where are you from adam 

12.98 15.98 B: i'm out in the bay area near san francisco 

15.64 18.65 A: well me too [laughter] this is 

16.87 18.21 B: (( are you really )) 

18.28 20.22 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

18.97 21.85 A: should i look around my office and see if you're there [laughter] 

21.23 23.59 B: i'm probably sitting right next to you yeah 

22.97 24.23 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

24.02 26.82 B: yeah i'm on the one on i'm in traffic right now 

26.42 28.00 A: oh you're on the cell phone 

27.91 29.32 B: yeah yeah 

28.51 30.11 A: yeah i'm in my office 

29.90 30.92 B: oh okay 

31.35 32.92 A: [mn] so not a hundred percent 

31.91 34.77 B: well i never done this before this is my first call 

34.38 41.01 A: this is only my second but i do do i do speech recognition for a living so i'm fairly familiar with this sort of stuff 

36.06 37.08 B: (( is it do )) 

40.45 44.27 B: you yeah i'm i'm a kind of a linguistics major 

41.06 41.94 A: yep 

43.95 46.39 A: uh-huh is that how you heard about this 

44.84 45.78 B: (( so )) 

46.22 47.54 B: yeah i mean 

47.56 52.36 B: yeah i've only taken one class so two classes so far but i i find it interesting 

50.32 51.45 A: mhm 

52.77 55.94 A: so i guess we're supposed to talk about the minimum wage increase 

54.78 56.65 B: the minimum wage okay 

56.71 61.40 A: [laughter] so is five fi- five dollars and fifteen cents an hour sufficient 

61.01 62.89 B: (( not where we live right )) 

62.33 66.24 A: yeah that's what i was gonna say the last time i worked for that amount i was uh 

66.33 72.13 A: uh in eighth grade i think [laughter] i do computer work so salaries are good 

68.39 70.21 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

70.33 71.50 B: yeah 

71.75 77.27 B: yeah well i mean f- you know out here we have in san francisco at least there's a living wage 

76.72 78.38 A: right 

77.42 88.74 B: which i think is probably a much better system because you know federal minimum wage has to apply to people out here or versus people here in mobile alabama you know and i think that it 

87.38 88.28 A: yeah i c- 

88.62 93.05 A: i can't imagine five dollars and fifteen cents is enough to live anywhere in the country do you 

93.34 98.46 B: you know i don't know i mean it's probably not it's probably just not or you'd probably have to have two jobs 

94.40 96.16 A: yeah 

96.36 97.33 A: (( yeah )) 

98.47 101.11 B: (( you know and a second wage earner in the hour but )) 

100.50 101.83 A: right 

101.34 103.53 B: but it's definitely not gonna fly out here 

103.11 107.13 A: yeah that's for sure do you know what the the living wage is in san francisco 

104.33 106.00 B: yeah 

107.19 111.17 B: you know i don't know what it is because it changes fairly often i think it's indexed 

109.90 110.72 A: yeah 

111.25 117.05 B: so i'm not sure it's probably closer to seven or eight dollars an hour i'd imagine yeah 

114.51 117.10 A: yeah i'd imagine yeah 

117.43 124.44 B: no five fifteen i think is probably too wild but you know depends on how the uh how the other countries or how the other parts of the country 

124.48 130.23 B: are structured because you know there's some places where you can actually buy a house for seventy five thousand dollars 

125.48 126.74 A: right 

129.62 132.60 A: that's right i have friends in in mountain view who 

130.40 131.36 B: (( so in )) 

132.64 141.18 A: they have tons of disposable income because they don't have enough to buy a house but they still have very good salaries it's very strange so 

138.09 143.47 B: exactly yeah yeah so they have a very very well equipped apartment 

143.08 145.57 A: exactly and they buy buy lots of 

143.85 145.71 B: and it's chock full of stuff 

145.65 150.39 A: lots of books and lots of gadgets they drive a nice car but uh they can't buy a house 

147.50 151.86 B: yeah can't afford a house yeah 

151.28 156.14 A: and you know and their their wages are twenty times minimum wage [laughter] 

155.42 166.36 B: yeah [laughter] yeah no it is that's quite difficult because when you're trying to legislate across the board but california has a minimum wage that's something like six dollars and fifty cents i think 

158.27 159.70 A: well ten times 

165.98 166.96 A: oh do they 

166.80 168.65 B: which probably makes more sense 

167.10 172.23 A: is that isn't that just for is that true or is that just for state employees 

172.68 184.52 B: oh you know i'm not sure actually now that you say it i mean i i know wh- what i work and make see i i intern in a a state agency and there's always that big you know poster up in the coffee room that says 

174.59 175.44 A: yeah 

180.23 181.24 A: mhm 

184.32 192.93 B: the federal minimum wage is such and such and the california minimum wage is six fifty but i didn't know if it if it only applied to state employers i'm not sure 

189.20 190.17 A: oh really 

192.72 194.49 A: right right 

193.52 202.10 B: yeah i don't even know if it applies to you know migrant farm labor and stuff like that 'cause they don't seem to be getting six dollars and fifty cents an hour 

195.20 195.97 A: (( and )) 

198.79 200.11 A: (( well [laughter] )) 

201.71 209.97 A: oh i'm sure they don't even get five dollars and fifteen cents and hour you know 'cause it's unreported so there's no enforcement they're not who are they gonna complain to [laughter] 

203.98 206.61 B: yeah yeah so true 

207.87 208.96 B: yeah 

209.89 212.86 B: (( [laughter] well yeah i mean if you're not yeah that's true )) 

213.69 215.18 A: but uh 

214.69 215.78 B: well 

216.02 217.24 B: (( shall we keep going )) 

217.12 220.00 A: i guess we we're supposed to [laughter] 

217.70 218.99 B: (( [laughter] you want me )) 

219.12 221.71 B: to keep going right all right well what else is there 

220.68 224.10 A: the problem is we agreed too much on minimum wage [laughter] [laughter] 

223.28 232.31 B: yeah well that's a shame really [laughter] actually you know the interesting thing is i'm taking a couple of econ classes and one of my professors was a big conservative and he was 

232.27 244.42 B: you know explaining and i guess the economics does make sense you know in theory but the minimum wage really hurts uh people like you you know skilled laborers in the higher income bracket because what you 

243.12 245.03 A: mhm mm why is that 

244.34 255.23 B: because what you do is is um you force the you force the bottom salary up and so companies are forced to expend more on labor that in the open market they could get for cheaper 

255.11 260.20 B: and so they have less money to spend on other things like you know highly skilled labor or 

258.12 259.64 A: uh i i don't think 

259.78 265.31 A: i don't think that's valid i mean i- because the places i work there's no one who makes minimum wage 

265.48 267.53 B: yeah probably not 

265.85 274.52 A: you know exc- i- they they contract out things like janitorial and and so on but but you know i do i'm a computer professional no one 

268.57 270.27 B: the contract out 

272.55 273.45 B: (( but the )) 

275.48 284.52 A: no one in the computer business makes minimum wage so i mean i think wh- what the minimum wage means is that mcdonald's hamburgers are more expensive not that i get paid less 

278.16 279.61 B: no no 

282.79 292.73 B: yeah well you know when when your company's outsourcing though they're outsourcing with companies that are giving bids that are actually higher because of the minimum wage 

292.66 298.87 A: i guess that's true but it's still it's a tiny percentage it's a tiny percentage of of the companies i work for 

293.91 300.09 B: yeah i mean i don't really think yeah it's a tiny percentage and the social benefits are probably outweigh 

300.52 302.85 B: they probably outweigh the cost anyway 

302.70 305.13 A: yeah it seems to me i mean th- you don't 

304.10 313.24 B: yeah but interesting it's the same you know it's the same question of uh when companies when when the government requires a company to pay for health insurance 

312.83 315.15 A: right right same question 

313.55 318.94 B: it's the same idea it's kinda like um a tax on young people who don't use the health insurance 

317.24 318.12 A: right 

319.02 321.22 B: versus the older people who do 

321.08 324.17 A: that's right and so the younger people are paying for the older 

321.96 323.80 B: i think it's the same issue 

324.21 330.83 B: yeah it's probably the same issue of burden but you know i mean the social benefits aren't outweighed 

330.51 341.79 A: yeah and as i said i think it it it's an uneven application you know so if if you work in the fast food industry then you maybe care about it a lot more than if you work in the computer industry 

335.14 336.00 B: uh-huh 

341.32 343.80 B: yeah it probably doesn't have much significance for you 

343.90 347.76 B: aside from yeah outside from an idealistic 

343.90 346.26 A: for me it it certainly doesn't 

347.40 350.10 A: right it doesn't have direct 

348.13 355.63 B: kind of you know issue yeah well maybe that's why it's such a you know it's uh minimum wage increases is so unpopular 

355.91 360.43 B: is that a majority of you know the the active political constituency 

356.20 357.21 A: right 

359.02 360.00 A: (( well espec- )) 

360.31 368.02 A: it's also who votes right the people who vote are you know rich white older men [laughter] 

361.99 363.37 B: yeah exactly 

366.35 369.47 B: yeah and so the minimum wage they could care less about it 

369.25 375.58 A: well yeah they just wanna they want it as low as possible so that if they're business owners they don't have to pay more 

375.62 380.59 B: yeah now you're doing you're doing computer work with speech recognition 

376.34 377.52 A: so uh 

380.25 381.87 A: yep 

380.95 382.30 B: (( software and )) 

382.27 388.87 A: yep i'm doing s- um sof- mostly software engineer i'm doing a little bit of hardware as well but most of the people i work with are software 

383.58 385.15 B: all that 

386.63 388.06 B: yeah 

388.18 393.11 B: that's cool yeah minimum wage i guess doesn't influence that industry much 

389.65 390.64 A: yeah so 

392.81 399.83 A: not very much as i say because you know other than the the lowest end of the support people 

393.81 395.93 B: (( no [laughter] i guess not )) 

399.19 400.83 B: yeah 

399.70 410.20 A: no one no one is making that little a- a- as i say that wasn't hasn't been since eighth grade that i made five dollars an hour you know by the time i was in high school i was making ten dollars an hour [laughter] 

402.17 403.61 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

406.90 408.03 B: probably not 

409.48 413.54 B: yeah and if you speak english you'll probably never get that minimum wage level 

413.43 416.82 A: right well i think probably in service industries you still do 

414.19 414.99 B: (( you know )) 

417.04 418.01 B: you really do 

418.12 419.48 B: you think at mcdonald's 

419.72 422.42 A: i imagine i mean why would they pay more 

422.94 428.22 B: i'm not sure i i don't know if they can get anybody to work for five dollars fifteen cents or whatever the 

426.68 436.92 A: i guess you know that's what we're saying in this area you can't live on that so all you would get is kids who are living at home and people who have other income yeah i guess that's true it might not be a 

430.19 431.60 B: yeah 

434.02 435.47 B: yeah 

436.36 445.05 B: yeah i'm only nineteen you know so i'm right outta high school and i can't remember one of my friends that worked at a mcdonald's or something like that 

437.21 438.76 A: might not make enough 

444.45 445.30 A: yeah 

445.35 453.17 B: yeah i mean that you know maybe more rural areas i guess there're not many other jobs available but we usually had cooler jobs in high school 

453.02 453.96 A: yeah 

453.37 454.22 B: (( you know )) 

454.47 457.75 B: i mean like the lamest job was host i think at a restaurant 

454.88 455.82 A: (( sorta like )) 

457.32 459.75 A: right right waiter and that sorta stuff 

458.07 460.59 B: but around here there are so many other things to do 

460.66 461.91 A: yeah that's true 

461.50 463.26 B: yeah 

463.01 464.03 A: but uh 

463.58 467.00 B: well i guess the time keeps going on right [laughter] 

465.35 472.09 A: [laughter] yeah i guess uh probably the the amount of talking really depends on the topic it depends on 

472.17 474.16 A: how much the people disagree 

472.38 475.92 B: yeah we- i mean you've done another one right what was the other topic 

476.07 477.46 A: what's that 

476.91 479.66 B: what was the other topic when for your first call 

478.22 479.71 A: uh family 

479.90 487.09 A: it was a family and i was speaking with a woman from new york who uh didn't let me get a word in edgewise [laughter] 

479.98 481.08 B: family 

486.14 490.12 B: (( [laughter] well that's got a that sounds easy isn't it )) 

487.26 488.91 A: it was pretty funny 

489.52 491.38 A: what's that 

490.38 491.89 B: that's kinda easy isn't it 

492.20 495.95 A: yeah i didn't have to support my end of the conversation at all 

495.45 501.59 B: yeah well what do you think about fair trade when they try and uh you know only trade with 

496.28 497.15 A: so 

501.64 506.68 B: industries in other countries where they actually re- respect their own minimum wage laws 

507.11 509.25 B: like with coffee and all that 

508.70 518.08 A: i think i- it's a pretty good idea you know uh um e- especially more as a marketing device so that you let the consumers decide to pay more 

511.15 512.96 B: yeah 

518.13 531.95 A: for that i think mandating it is not a good idea but you know i i live in berkley so obviously i'm very aware of stuff like that and you know i've i i prefer to go to the coffee shops that that buy fair trade coffee but you know 

518.26 520.41 B: yeah rather than 

521.73 522.57 B: yeah 

523.87 526.48 B: oh so yeah yeah 

530.83 537.34 B: yeah but you think it's you think it's more important to let it be a free market activity rather than like legislating it 

537.26 544.15 A: i think so just uh that sort of legislation i think is so open to abuse i mean who who gets to decide 

538.34 539.80 B: yeah 

543.27 546.19 B: yeah how can you determine sure 

546.38 548.38 A: the gamesmanship involved in that 

546.55 554.25 B: yeah now in brooklyn how does it work do they do they actually show you i mean is there like a there's like a little sticker or something right yeah 

551.98 559.49 A: that's right right so so the coffee shops that do that have a sticker out that say that they only only buy fair trade 

558.89 562.72 B: yeah what was you know it'd be great to expand that to other industries 

563.21 568.71 A: that's right i think i think the reason it started with coffee is because it's so bad in the coffee industry 

568.10 570.82 B: yeah well i was reading about you know 

568.72 570.75 A: um yeah so exploitive 

571.02 573.49 A: you know jeans and shoes [laughter] 

573.40 585.59 B: yeah the sweatshops and all that i was reading actually that you know the the ch- h- chocolate harvesting the ivory coast it you know the workforce there is pretty much like slave labor 

574.55 575.59 A: yep 

579.56 580.42 A: yeah 

585.80 593.61 A: yeah i've heard that there's actually now a a free trade chocolate as well that some of the companies are now advertising free trade chocolate for the same reason 

589.52 590.99 B: oh is there really 

592.68 599.89 B: that would be great 'cause i read this article on ceylon and on valentine's day and i thought well that's fitting isn't it you know half the choc- 

593.84 594.80 A: yeah 

598.37 599.89 A: [laughter] that's really funny
