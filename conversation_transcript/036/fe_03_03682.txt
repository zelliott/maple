0.00 1.41 A: richard 

0.89 2.30 B: derek [noise] 

3.42 4.60 B: i've 

3.82 5.59 A: hey hey how're you doing 

5.04 7.94 B: i'm doing all right how much was the minimum wage again 

5.98 6.73 A: (( good )) 

7.48 13.47 A: yeah it's do we feel that ah minimum wage is sufficient they're increasing it to five fifteen or five fifty an hour 

13.64 17.94 B: whoa where's that at where i live right now it's six ninety 

17.47 18.91 A: oh yeah 

19.56 26.37 A: yeah i'm um i live in philadelphia and um you know i i don't know i mean i i think minimum wage increases are i 

27.30 33.96 A: i don't know man it's ah you know i've been thinking about it and ah i don't know anybody who works for minimum wage anyway 

34.50 39.95 B: ah ah i used to a while back nah you can't really live off that much 

37.53 38.41 A: (( you know )) 

39.87 47.24 A: yeah i mean but at the same time you know like for me i'd rather the government stay out of like business for the most part 

47.27 48.45 B: yeah 

47.83 60.18 A: you know what i mean just because like you know let the free market determine it like you know even mcdonalds won't hire you in this area for less than seven dollars an hour if you're gonna work full time so really the minimum wage only affects like teenagers 

48.66 49.57 B: yeah 

61.02 66.79 B: yeah or people that just can't find a job anywhere else don't have a diploma crap like that 

66.21 74.88 A: right you know so like basically teen or you know like teenagers or people like that or you know you do feel kind of bad for the people who can't earn more than minimum wage 

74.98 77.58 B: yeah they just need to go and learn a skill though 

77.45 83.44 A: you know but the only thing that will happen is they'll end up increasing the wages for everybody el- i mean the the prices for everything so 

83.47 91.91 B: yeah they'll boost everything up and [sigh] man i remember when i was a kid soda used to cost like what was it thirty five cents for a can 

91.78 92.96 A: yeah 

92.34 95.21 B: now it's just like too too much like a buck 

95.68 99.23 A: oh i know i know it's like a dollar twenty five in some places 

99.06 109.16 B: yeah i live in oregon so in yeah i used to live in ah upstate new york for a while too so i know how expensive it gets out on the eastern side 

101.22 102.36 A: oh yeah 

108.72 113.27 A: i mean some places are nice like you could do ah fairly well on minimum wage in florida 

112.76 115.07 B: [cough] yeah keep 

113.66 119.05 A: [laughter] your rent's three hundred dollars a month or you know a mortgage isn't much more 

118.89 125.16 B: yeah here we ah pay six sixty five a month for a two bedroom with a washer dryer and everything 

124.61 132.54 A: right that's ah that's a little bit better standard of living than in philadelphia for that you'd probably get about seven hundred eight hundred dollars you can't afford it on minimum wage 

132.38 133.38 B: no 

133.01 133.89 A: um 

134.80 137.66 B: can't even afford gas on minimum wage [laughter] 

134.86 135.66 A: it 

136.85 142.18 A: [laughter] yeah right um yeah so i don't know i mean it really depends i mean i 

142.46 152.71 A: i mean i couldn't imagine being a business owner and just like being locked into a certain salary you know although minimum wage is reasonable and you know that if you're a business owner you're probably better off 

149.25 150.12 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

153.02 158.04 A: um paying more to your you know employees because you'll you'll get better quality employees that way 

158.66 170.09 B: yeah i i i guess it's good to have a higher minimum wage if you're just starting out but you know there's no reason you can't go out and learn a skill i learned my skill in high school and i'm still doing it and i'm making pretty good money off of it 

168.92 175.05 A: i mean even customer service ah you could get ah you know nine ten bucks an hour i mean that's j- now that's just basic 

173.71 174.70 B: yeah 

175.18 176.68 A: be nice to people 

175.22 176.24 B: what it 

176.91 182.62 B: like ah ah for a while i worked ah graveyards at a grocery store doing stocking and i was making 

182.69 185.03 B: [sigh] when i left nine twenty five an hour 

184.88 187.19 A: yeah that's not bad 

186.49 188.35 B: and i'd only been there three months 

189.40 192.05 A: yeah what do you do if you don't mind me asking 

189.61 191.44 B: right now ah i do ah 

191.99 193.10 B: what's that 

192.52 194.59 A: what do you do if you don't mind me asking oh 

193.82 198.94 B: ah i'm a car detailer right now for ah land rover mercedes and ferrari and porche 

198.65 206.21 A: that sounds cool you know i mean you know basically cleaning cars i think i have an idea that you know you clean the cars you get a set price per car 

199.87 201.14 B: yeah 

205.95 207.18 B: yeah 

206.43 209.14 A: move on the faster you can do it the more money you make 

209.00 213.93 B: yeah basically that's how i work ah today i made a hundred and fifty bucks so 

213.72 215.12 A: that's good stuff 

214.90 216.63 B: i ain't doing bad for the day 

217.57 221.76 A: no i don't make a hundred and fifty in a day man [laughter] that's g- that's good 

221.81 229.82 B: yeah but usually i'm there for about twelve hours sometimes a little bit longer but you know i'm always i gotta wait around for work or whatever sometimes some days 

224.42 225.55 A: yeah 

229.93 232.79 B: some days the works already there waiting for me so 

232.33 236.46 A: so some days you're banging them out and some days you're waiting for 'em to show up 

235.91 236.88 B: (( yep )) 

236.99 237.87 A: yeah 

237.02 239.22 B: winter time's the slowest around here 

239.32 244.34 A: yeah i'm a i'm an admin assistant so i [laughter] you know what i mean 

244.10 245.77 B: yeah 

244.72 258.07 A: but ah yeah i don't know i mean on that whole minimum wage i'm kinda kinda torn you know like there's this whole living wage argument that everybody's putting forth you not everybody's putting forth but that some people are putting forth it's more 

258.30 262.17 A: on the liberal side you know and at at the same time i don't know 

262.78 268.53 B: yeah well the the minimum wage right now is still ah more than what i got paid when i was in the navy 

268.51 269.84 A: you were in the navy too 

269.54 270.63 B: yeah 

270.04 271.26 A: yeah that's cool 

271.38 277.58 B: i was a machinist mate third class and i i was i was only making every two weeks about three or four hundred bucks 

277.10 282.73 A: yeah i was in the reactor department in fact i was a fireman effectively filling in for the function of a machinist mate so 

283.20 284.33 B: yeah 

283.27 288.18 A: you know they should have mil- minimum wage for military members [laughter] 

287.22 290.67 B: yeah they should they should and better food too 

290.18 293.17 A: you know what i mean you why don't you work for two bucks an hour 

293.14 303.80 B: oh yeah i ah i remember on my ship ah they ah tried to ah cut out all the meat 'cause we were getting too fat or something like that and they started feeding us soy meat 

293.60 294.27 A: (( [laughter] ah )) 

294.88 295.87 A: it 

304.18 305.46 A: that's terrible 

305.31 307.28 B: yeah you're telling me 

305.97 307.05 A: (( [laughter] at )) 

307.27 310.40 A: least you could tell what kind of meat you were eating though [laughter] 

309.32 316.19 B: [noise] but the officers still got to eat regular meat so i was breaking into the reefers through the ah air ducts and getting in through there 

315.48 317.44 A: were you that's awesome 

317.31 324.91 B: [noise] and ah taking all their steaks and i was grilling 'em up over ah i had one of the h._t.s hooked me up with a torch a butane torch 

324.62 325.69 A: right 

325.11 327.40 B: and they welded me up like a little stove 

327.49 331.10 B: put the butane torch underneath it i was grilling steaks in a void [noise] 

331.50 339.41 A: yeah that's good i never broke in to any of the officers mess or anything but they they were feeding us too so [laughter] never ah 

333.58 334.60 B: [laughter] 

339.46 341.94 A: never had the desire to get the meat but um 

341.28 344.84 B: yes i had i had to get me a good time i was in the navy though 

345.86 348.87 B: fun time i just didn't get paid all that well 

348.36 353.58 A: yeah it does suck being poor i mean that that's the other thing too you know like 

354.09 361.23 A: [sigh] i don't i don't know i mean i really feel like if they paid more than the minimum wage i might be able to get my order right when i go to mcdonalds 

361.75 362.97 B: maybe [noise] 

362.27 374.62 A: i mean could you imagine you know being able to go to a mcdonalds or something and and you just get your order right the whole time you know you don't even have to double check it or you know just any fast food place not that it's like my big goal in life or anything but 

374.45 378.21 A: but i mean you know an increase in minimum wage might take care of that 

377.97 392.16 B: [laughter] yeah but yeah i don't know it still it still might not even help their mind set their mind set might ah might even be totally just like changed you know they just might be like well hey i'm getting paid more money but i'm doing the same kinda job you know i might as well slough of a little bit more 

391.77 395.27 A: yeah that is true like wi- with economics i like to see um 

396.18 399.72 A: you know i i like to see the pay tied directly to production 

399.66 406.58 B: yeah i mean if they're gonna do good and they're gonna work hard and they're gonna make things right the first time they should be paid better 

403.80 404.54 A: right 

406.75 410.41 A: i mean yeah i c- i mean i could yeah that's the thing like i could see when um 

411.32 417.08 A: when people you know in production you know increases you know i think really when you have imbalances in production 

417.35 420.12 A: is when you you start losing employees 

420.18 421.44 B: yeah 

420.78 427.23 A: or you have an imbalance in the amount of employees you need like if you you know if you have too much production and not enough money 

427.48 432.27 A: you know like if it's not balanced out correctly your employees are obviously gonna seek greener pastures 

432.54 437.48 A: and if if if a job's too good you know you're gonna bring in a bunch of people that aren't gonna produce 

432.69 433.80 B: yeah 

438.07 444.24 A: and um yeah i definitely think it needs to be tied to production i i think the when they raise minimum wages it's arbitrary mm 

444.38 448.29 B: yeah they i mean they should just give it to say whoever's the top performers 

448.89 455.61 B: and like it's sort of like a reward program you know saying hey you know you do good at this job hey guess what we're gonna give you a pay rise 

455.15 469.69 A: yeah i mean it does help a lot of people who are working in an illegal ah trade market like labor market like ah illegal immigrants becoming americans they get you know they buy their fake i._d.s and they work on they technically work on the books but they don't file their taxes 

459.69 460.45 B: mm 

469.92 470.87 B: yeah 

469.92 473.97 A: so it helps those people out because now they have to be paid you know minimum wage 

474.71 481.47 A: i mean but i i don't know if it like actually helps the rest of the population out other than teenagers that are getting paid a little bit more 

481.04 486.20 B: yeah that that with the illegal immigrants thing though i just don't really dig that deal at all 

485.86 490.73 A: no not ah i mean you know i'm not really worrying about legislation to ah 

487.05 488.07 B: but 

491.08 495.20 A: you know it's not a primary concern it's just a side note i thought i'd bring up if there's 

494.55 500.81 B: the last the last time ah the last place i worked at that grocery store everybody there was illegal except for me 

498.08 498.88 A: uh-huh 

501.39 507.79 A: yeah you you so you know what i'm talking about they they they buy their their fake i._d.s and they register and they get their fake 

501.79 503.44 B: (( you know i was the only one in the store )) 

506.85 510.46 B: yeah but the store manager gave it to 'em so he could hire them in 

510.31 515.45 A: right but that that's all the minimum wage increase is gonna help i really believe i 

511.33 512.75 B: and then ah 

514.97 525.53 B: yeah that you know i truly believe that i even called the immigration and said this is the deal and they laughed in my face and said we can't do nothing about it [laughter] 

520.85 522.13 A: yeah they won't do anything 

525.72 527.56 B: i was just like what [noise] 

527.33 532.42 A: yeah they won't do anything um oh what was what was i thinking i think um 

533.68 535.10 A: yeah i i don't 

535.29 538.05 A: you know i i think that and 

539.05 545.03 A: yeah just i don't know that increasing the minimum wage is really gonna help but at the same time i worked as a retail manager 

545.18 551.04 A: and i've seen the you know the profit and labor reports and these companies could afford to pay more than what they're paying 

550.92 559.53 B: yeah but i- i- in the same sense though i- i- it could be coming out you know as the as the same same thing as light and nafta was you know 

551.55 552.50 A: um 

559.70 563.31 B: remember saying oh nafta's gonna be great and then the job loss 

563.98 564.87 B: (( you know )) 

564.94 573.99 A: yeah i'm i'm not really familiar with the the repercussions of nafta so i can't really speak about it intelligently but i mean i understand what it is but i didn't really 

565.00 566.48 B: it could be just 

571.27 572.26 B: yeah 

573.85 581.66 B: i mean like ah half the auto makers ah that were you know based in the u._s. you know like pontiac and stuff like that all moved to mexico 

581.83 583.52 B: where it was cheaper labor 

583.44 585.23 A: right 

584.12 585.11 B: (( you know )) 

585.28 593.45 B: and you know if they raised like the minimum wage here you know all we're gonna do is pretty much put more money in the illegal immigrants pockets that are coming over here 

593.51 595.61 A: we'd shift work overseas 

593.67 594.51 B: so 

595.47 597.31 B: yeah 

597.35 599.83 B: so basically we're just giving them even more money
