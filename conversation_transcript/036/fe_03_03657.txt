5.68 9.20 A: okay san diego california [mn] okay 

7.87 13.20 B: [mn] i bet our views on minimum wage are a lot different then [laughter] 

11.93 15.74 A: not necessarily i lived in atlanta for a while and new york for a while 

15.75 18.23 A: i've lived overseas what do you think about it 

18.20 20.72 B: um down here five fifteen an hour 

20.84 24.09 B: actually is enough to live on so [laughter] um 

22.27 23.32 A: (( mhm )) 

24.27 26.22 B: our cost of living is very low 

26.08 29.48 A: yeah no kidding [laughter] yeah [noise] uh-huh 

27.14 36.03 B: [laughter] yeah that's a livable wage where i can see yeah and in new york city or san diego [noise] that is not a livable wage [noise] 

30.41 31.44 A: mhm 

35.39 43.44 A: in santa barbara there's a big stink going on now they're trying to raise it to what they call a liv- a min- a living wage of eleven dollars an hour 

44.33 45.32 B: well 

44.90 46.10 A: yeah which 

46.32 50.22 A: considering that a one bedroom apartment is fourteen hundred dollars 

49.63 50.44 B: (( ooh )) 

50.41 52.08 A: ooh yeah 

50.88 57.41 B: i can't [laughter] imagine that yeah my my three thousand square foot house payment is eight hundred dollars a month [laughter] 

52.31 53.29 A: (( yeah )) 

55.74 61.74 A: there we go [laughter] yeah um i hey do you ever listen to neil bortz 

62.80 64.92 B: [noise] i haven't heard of him no i'm sorry 

62.91 64.01 A: neil bortz 

64.16 69.97 A: okay all right he's ah he's in atlanta on w._s._b._i._u. when i lived in atlanta i used to listen to him all the time 

70.15 81.18 A: and his feeling about the minimum wage is that if you're earning the minimum wage you have no business getting married you have to go and get yourself an education that there shouldn't be a minimum wage 

81.79 83.06 A: [mn] but i think 

81.89 83.92 B: i actually can agree with that 

83.70 88.14 A: but i think if there's not a minimum wage then management is going to take total advantage of you 

88.18 88.97 A: [noise] too 

88.84 90.01 B: right 

89.44 94.51 A: so where do you draw the line in puerto rico for example i lived in puerto rico for five years okay 

94.20 95.46 B: oh wow okay 

94.85 106.22 A: yeah and down there people with masters degrees are getting six twenty five an hour and competing for the jobs [noise] [lipsmack] okay and the [noise] living standard is higher than atlanta's 

100.99 101.87 B: (( mm )) 

106.48 117.63 A: [noise] okay how they make ends meet i i ah every- everybody's under the table that's the only thing i can think of you know [mn] but um the thing is they have down there something called a training wage 

117.76 122.57 A: which makes sense to me that for your first three months on the job you get a dollar less an hour 

122.67 124.01 A: while you're in training 

124.39 134.26 A: then after that they raise you to the minimum but what they do is they l- they lay you off after eighty nine days and they say well you didn't do a good job even if you did a blasted good job [noise] 

134.76 142.60 A: so the ah m- ah management is going to find a loop hole and take advantage of it so you know i think i think the minimum wage is a necessary evil 

143.09 150.51 B: i can see where that in some areas in some work forces definitely um as a i'm actually an employer 

150.12 151.41 A: (( [noise] oh okay )) 

150.54 151.26 B: um 

151.71 153.73 B: as an employer okay 

151.91 153.25 A: hold on a minute hold on 

155.91 157.53 A: what kind of a place do you have 

157.23 159.59 B: um actually industrial manufacturing 

159.18 161.99 A: oh man so that makes a big difference to you yeah 

161.53 165.79 B: we have about three hundred employees now for us there 

163.18 164.13 A: okay 

166.10 169.75 B: even our what you would call minimum wage employees aren't minimum wage 

170.72 172.34 A: uh-huh they aren't 

170.81 179.87 B: they are no low end employees um our cleaners make six dollars an hour and that's for taking wire brush to pieces of steel 

175.66 176.64 A: okay 

179.64 181.98 A: oh now that's pretty hard that's hard work 

180.04 181.03 B: [laughter] 

182.14 187.47 B: definitely and especially in the summer trust me you would not want to trade places with them [laughter] 

182.89 183.79 A: yeah 

185.89 188.36 A: no no no i i know that okay i 

187.70 188.77 B: but um 

188.44 191.46 A: i used to work outside in atlanta in the summer so i know 

191.36 197.89 B: ooh definitely [laughter] but um but that said 

192.58 194.66 A: okay so yeah go ahead 

197.90 201.88 B: if we say okay we're going to pay everybody five fifteen an hour 

201.58 202.61 A: mhm 

201.98 203.63 B: when they start 

202.85 204.00 A: mhm 

204.05 211.35 B: and that that's the minimum to start with you get people who go well that's minimum wage that's what they have to pay me so there's no reason for me to work 

210.98 212.10 A: exactly 

212.16 217.02 B: so you have there has to be some incentive both directions 

214.31 215.32 A: (( mhm )) 

216.39 217.40 A: mhm 

217.95 220.40 B: 'cause here you can live on five fifteen an hour 

218.09 218.96 A: i think 

219.36 227.95 A: no no well i'm well [mn] out here no but i mean for what you're getting ah for i think s- six bucks an hour is fair but do you give them raises or 

227.38 228.64 B: oh definitely 

228.28 229.20 A: uh-huh 

228.79 232.56 B: and in fact we offer um like reading here 

232.68 242.11 B: people adults being able to read is is one of those things you have tr- a hard time finding [mn] um so we give 'em like remedial reading classes and that kind of thing yes

246.68 252.76 A: well are they like um ah are they english speaking or spanish speaking that they can't really and they can't read 

249.88 251.08 B: english speaking 

251.64 252.50 B: really 

252.52 255.48 B: no not at all that's um

324.11 325.08 A: uh-huh 

327.44 329.48 B: we need to teach people that 

328.56 329.13 A: (( [noise] )) 

329.71 337.89 B: education's important because he's absolutely right that you know without an education what's the point of of trying to live a life 

331.24 332.36 A: mhm 

337.30 338.26 A: uh-huh 

338.86 346.68 A: well you sound you sound to be pretty decent ah pretty l- pre- pretty decently treated b- by ah your employees seem to treat you well or you treat them well i mean

357.60 358.38 B: (( mhm )) 

358.12 360.84 A: okay yeah you were describing the job yeah 

358.83 360.41 B: industrial manufacturing 

360.84 364.78 B: and so i mean if we don't train our employees 

361.70 362.92 A: [noise] 

364.94 366.03 A: mhm 

365.19 368.06 B: and move them out of where they're making no money 

366.95 368.76 A: mhm mhm 

368.28 372.86 B: then they're going to find other places and other jobs where they'll make a little more 

372.26 376.79 A: and their incentive with what you're teaching them then they can move up with that right 

376.96 378.11 B: correct 

377.51 381.95 A: if they get what do they get high school equivalency or something or what [mn] [noise]

386.53 394.60 B: um now they have to they have to pay for the education up front they pay for the classes if they get a c. or better then we reimburse them 

390.19 391.07 A: yeah 

391.21 392.17 A: mhm 

394.11 395.57 A: wow 

396.40 400.78 B: but that's i mean some people will tell you in fact some of our employees will tell you that's not fair 

400.53 401.64 A: (( what )) 

402.22 408.04 B: oh because they have to pay for it up front if they had the money then [laughter] they would have already gone 

404.45 406.22 A: oh well gee 

407.89 408.86 A: thank you

521.51 532.51 A: and then management was supposed to make up the difference to you but they never did they never made it up to me some nights i would be there and i'd only work on a whole night shift i would get ah maybe three dollars in a whole night 

532.81 533.58 B: oh

579.85 581.32 A: right i know that 

582.65 595.98 B: but that th- there needs to be some protection for the employees but to say we're going to have a government mandated wage [mn] you know five fifteen an hour just from our conversation five fifteen an hour isn't a livable wage where you are and here it's good money 

593.96 596.27 A: mhm [noise] right
