0.82 1.98 B: (( hello )) 

2.64 4.82 A: hi this is kathleen 

5.06 6.45 B: hi my name's aaron 

6.63 8.46 A: have you done this before 

8.40 10.25 B: uh i've done it at least once 

9.88 11.41 A: [laughter] oh okay 

11.50 15.82 B: uh about the minimum wage thing i uh i actually was just uh 

15.96 18.12 B: uh laid off last week uh 

18.35 21.85 B: and i didn't even realize that it wasn't uh five fifteen an hour 

22.45 22.99 A: (( w- )) 

23.04 27.19 A: well that's kind of interesting because i think it is five fifteen an hour 

26.66 29.07 B: that's what i thought [laughter] i thought it already was 

27.73 28.71 A: and i 

28.88 33.57 A: i think the question is is you know should it be raised higher 

33.63 37.34 A: that's what a lot of people are talking about well 

33.65 35.13 B: of course 

36.57 37.95 B: yeah 

37.77 45.87 A: um you know i i c- i'm wondering if it defeats the whole concept of the free market 

46.08 47.24 A: where 

47.32 55.18 A: um wages would rise naturally if no one would accept the job if it paid so low 

55.04 56.08 B: right 

55.99 57.16 A: um 

57.19 62.76 A: and i don't know what what do you think how does this fit in with illegal immigration 

62.99 67.71 B: well jeez i wasn't even thinking of illegal immigration but yeah it do- 

65.64 71.39 A: [laughter] oh i i live a few i live uh less than fifty miles from the mexican border [laughter] 

71.07 72.68 B: oh jeez 

72.41 73.94 A: and um 

73.98 75.20 A: um 

75.23 82.57 A: it's very interesting here um uh a lot of people who uh work in restaurants 

82.62 86.87 A: uh can't find people to work at minimum wage 

86.82 99.05 A: in the kitchen as dishwashers and busboys and whatever and uh most of whom they hire w- w- who the hire are illegal immigrants because they'll work for that wage 

88.93 90.21 B: right 

98.95 100.47 B: right 'cause they're willing 

100.34 101.88 A: yeah 

100.80 101.85 B: wow 

102.16 104.26 B: that's uh brings in entire 

102.43 110.62 A: uh the same with housecleaning uh most people pay their house cleaners and gardeners under the table 

110.70 111.86 A: um 

111.87 113.12 A: um 

113.03 124.07 B: that's nice i'm actually looking for well i wouldn't say i'm looking for a job like that but i'm [laughter] looking for any job at the present time and when i thought about five fifty five fifteen being the minimum wage 

114.26 114.96 A: (( [laughter] )) 

123.65 126.31 A: that's not a lot that's not a lot of money is 

125.64 130.57 B: see that's what i thought that's what i was thinking to myself and i just read something in an article that said that it uh 

131.20 140.56 B: had taken inflation into consideration and whatnot and you think back to the fifties and many times we think of the fifties as a uh you know a golden age of 

135.13 137.02 A: (( it yeah )) 

140.35 147.00 B: [laughter] uh am- [laughter] american development of the uh the the uh 

140.98 142.22 A: right [laughter] 

147.14 154.13 B: [lipsmack] of our infrastructure uh the roads the the housing developments and whatnot and people purchasing things 

154.13 167.36 B: and the minimum wage w- compared to now it supposedly it now it has like thirty seven percent less capacity buying capacity than it did at that time yeah 

164.60 170.79 A: really so would it be the equivalent of you know seven to it should be like seven dollars an hour or whatever 

169.90 175.81 B: yeah when i heard that number i was like wow we're talking even closer to ten bucks an hour than uh 

174.37 182.25 A: yeah i i actually yeah i- i'm torn because i actually don't think there's anybody that could live o- on five fifteen an hour 

181.91 183.19 B: exactly 

182.37 184.26 A: you know i figure out 

184.56 192.65 A: you know that i need fifteen hundred dollars a month to live on and when you figure that out um 

188.93 190.16 B: mhm 

192.69 196.37 A: you know that's twelve dollars an hour or something you know 

195.13 196.73 B: yeah there you go 

196.76 198.60 A: and so um 

199.01 202.45 A: i- i- you know so once again i'm torn 

202.21 203.29 B: (( [laughter] )) 

202.54 205.79 A: between uh you know free market economy 

204.67 206.88 B: (( yeah do you have a fre- m- right )) 

206.03 209.23 A: [laughter] right and um 

209.40 210.07 A: (( i- )) 

210.26 220.37 A: there's not a lot of examples where you know i think the government has to get involved with the economy unless something illegal is going on 

220.52 221.47 B: right 

220.70 221.77 A: (( some )) 

221.77 224.47 B: something clearly illegal something uh 

223.49 228.61 A: yeah now h- it's been five fifteen an hour for a long time hasn't it 

228.52 234.01 B: it is when they said that it has been raised it ha- that hasn't happened recently that happened quite a while ago 

233.27 235.71 A: i think so i think i [laughter] 

234.32 248.38 B: okay i remember bill clinton signed the bill signed that thing into action yeah yeah 'cause at one point it was the first it first went up to four seventy five and then it gave them a few more years before it actually went to five fifteen it was this thing that they could plan for 

237.12 240.40 A: is that it do you think okay because 

248.38 253.33 B: and businesses would know ahead of time so i mean that was a while ago 

248.53 250.09 A: yeah 

251.54 262.30 A: and that i don't yeah so and then um now recently i can't remember there were some cities and they toyed with it here um 

262.35 265.89 A: maybe it was in california that's where it's always so progressive 

265.40 266.63 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

265.81 280.28 A: um where they raised you know the city minimum wage to like nine or ten dollars an hour like you couldn't do business with the city or have a contract with the city unless you paid your employees quote a living wage 

280.11 290.69 B: right ooh yeah oh gosh i have i've i've heard of munci- municipalities you know toying with the idea but i don't i don't know where it where they were i didn't know it was that high 

280.24 282.73 A: do you remember hearing anything about that 

285.96 287.42 A: yeah 

288.94 289.85 A: okay 

290.74 300.35 A: yeah and and then i'm wondering you know my theory is when they try to impose things like that people just find ways of working around it 

300.48 304.86 A: a- and i'm just curious how that went that would affect 

304.94 306.47 A: my opinion 

305.13 306.30 B: right oh i know 

306.33 310.13 B: i'm pretty sure some municipalities have higher minimum wages 

310.15 311.22 A: they do 

310.25 313.20 B: and i think i think they do and it works 

311.89 315.46 A: oh oh oh oh than the federal government's minimum 

315.23 324.05 B: right there's the federal government's minimum is is a minimum but i think over the mun- municipality but it th- the idea with that is i would i would assume that businesses would take 

324.61 329.14 B: business out of the [sigh] out of the munc- municipality if it was that high 

328.65 332.13 A: uh right or just raise their prices or 

329.15 330.48 B: if it was 

331.96 334.50 B: or it would make it would hurt their you know 

332.22 333.21 A: or 

333.22 338.92 A: or they go to this thing where they're not really employees they're independent contractors 

338.07 340.87 B: right oh right 

340.32 342.20 A: yeah and so 

343.31 347.15 B: no benefi- well no hope of benefits that way and 

346.23 350.01 A: or yeah or maybe they cut something else out like benefits 

349.49 352.16 B: (( right right smaller benefits )) 

350.18 351.27 A: right 

352.80 365.93 B: i uh well i mean i just uh it just just the fact that i was i lost my job recently i'm i'm okay right now but thinking i mean i was even thinking of what kind of a position would i be able to take that would allow me 

366.38 368.24 B: perhaps not to uh 

369.38 372.50 B: live the same way i had but comfortable enough 

370.64 384.62 A: [laughter] [laughter] [sigh] right and and do you want you don't wanna take something for s- five or six dollars an hour because you can't really live on it but it's better than nothing but then you don't have time to look for a better job because you're 

378.68 380.05 B: (( right )) 

380.35 381.50 B: right right 

384.60 385.73 A: working 

384.68 398.30 B: working in this thing exactly yeah i well and my re- i'm lucky my rent is low but uh i live in philadelphia and rent is going up here constantly uh so i mean i'm 

386.38 388.17 A: yeah 

394.54 396.29 A: oh yeah 

398.87 404.38 B: other people who might be in the same similar situation have a much harder time than even me perhaps 

404.86 405.42 B: (( [cough] )) 

404.93 406.51 A: with a family 

406.46 408.36 B: yes i have none of that 

406.84 410.17 A: yeah with children or something like that yeah 

409.38 411.04 B: yeah well that's the idea 

411.11 419.60 B: the minimum is the minimum wage like you were saying is the point of a minimum wage uh is it supposed to allow someone to raise a family 

419.74 421.33 A: yeah well if 

421.42 429.31 A: and then i wonder you know so they raise the minimum wage and then what happens is uh jobs 

429.30 439.43 A: you know get moved overseas to third world countries where they pay people you know fifty cents an hour the equivalent of fifty cents an hour 

434.05 434.76 B: yeah 

437.11 438.29 B: even less 

439.15 440.06 B: yes 

440.12 444.38 A: which has already happened and so 

443.41 445.88 B: already and continues to happen yes 

445.27 446.74 A: yeah so 

446.87 450.16 A: uh y- you know it's very complex 

450.51 451.43 A: um 

450.80 454.66 B: it's not so simple uh thinking about [laughter] the five fifteen 

454.84 456.08 B: an hour 

455.45 456.51 A: (( [laughter] i'm lo- )) 

456.54 461.09 A: okay now you know how long do we have to play this we have to play this game for ten minutes 

460.80 462.53 B: (( i have no idea )) 

461.84 469.43 A: you get i mean it says ten minutes but i'm going like do y- they called me yesterday and asked me to talk on the huts for ten minutes and i 

469.58 470.88 A: and i um

471.31 472.47 B: well they called 

475.51 486.88 B: i uh i've had other conversations that were actually uh the topic was a lot better the the um the time allotment was a lot smaller [laughter] so it must be very inter- 

477.92 478.67 A: (( minutes )) 

480.43 481.54 A: yeah [laughter] 

484.21 489.11 A: oh really 'cause they told me this was always ten minutes you had to talk ten minutes 

488.65 493.68 B: not well maybe it's changed since my first since i last called um 

490.45 491.50 A: yeah 

492.36 493.29 A: okay 

493.44 494.87 A: (( [laughter] )) 

494.47 498.10 B: [laughter] please beep in say something beep in uh 

497.17 504.10 A: i forgot [laughter] i forgot to check the clock when we started [laughter] [laughter]

502.64 506.93 B: i i have a friend who work- oh i don't know we're supposed to stay on topic i don't know how to stay on topic now 

505.70 513.10 A: are we it was like i'm wondering you know what kinda research this is like [laughter] how how soon before you stray off topic 

507.54 508.09 B: (( w- )) 

509.48 510.29 B: well 

512.21 521.05 B: i think that's part of it i do think that is probably part of it um yeah and attempts to get back on target are oh 

513.48 515.20 A: [laughter] 

515.79 516.68 A: oh 

521.09 527.53 A: really yeah i have to go look at the directions maybe i don't get paid if they listen to this [laughter] 

521.46 522.31 B: uh 

522.44 524.91 B: [laughter] 

526.37 535.84 B: i and i do think they tell you to try to stay on topic and but this is all part of the i mean this is all part of the study uh i'm sure um 

529.87 531.72 A: okay all right 

533.30 534.70 A: yeah 

536.59 540.44 B: yeah well you live in fifty miles from the mexican border

551.47 554.59 A: (( unbelievable um )) 

554.73 563.98 A: uh you know uh these people their their lives are so much worse than they are here working for five dollars an hour you know some it's 

559.79 561.64 B: yeah i mean w- we would say 

562.03 567.42 B: right right we would say it's wo- we'd say look at how they're living but it's a lot better than 

567.45 573.84 A: yeah so it's just it's really complex an- especially you kno- um 

573.94 576.86 A: with the unemployment rate the way it is too 

576.76 577.92 B: yes 

577.36 579.44 A: right i mean

583.54 584.93 B: well or [laughter] 

589.15 597.67 B: well that's what i was gonna say that that i noticed about today that when i was in college in the uh nineties i guess it was early nineties
