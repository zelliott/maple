79.85 81.11 A: yeah 

90.23 92.01 A: oh the amount of increase 

91.49 92.88 B: yes 

92.57 94.45 A: that's a pretty big increase 

95.06 96.04 B: (( ah )) 

95.86 97.77 A: to increase it by five dollars 

97.53 98.43 B: uh-huh 

99.08 101.43 A: yeah okay that makes sense 

101.34 102.39 B: yes 

102.04 108.97 A: i wasn't sure if that was it or if that was the proposed amount of the of the new wage i thought no it's already over that 

105.88 107.40 B: [laughter] 

108.62 111.78 B: uh-huh yes i'm also thinking about that 

109.80 110.71 A: okay 

112.39 113.63 B: k- kind 

113.00 113.80 A: oh 

114.30 119.38 B: (( kind of ah a little bit of confusing so how's the weather over there )) 

118.79 122.56 A: ah it's it's you know it's not quite summer yet it's it's ah 

121.74 123.73 B: it's not so 

122.74 124.43 A: yeah fifty sixties 

124.62 127.22 B: so you are still enjoying spring right 

127.24 128.76 A: i think so yeah 

128.18 129.74 B: [laughter] 

128.82 129.82 A: how about you 

129.95 132.88 B: oh it it's all right it's quite hot here 

133.38 137.25 A: oh yeah well i'm a little jealous but that's okay 

134.26 135.24 B: mhm 

136.95 140.47 B: [laughter] [cough] well um 

141.10 143.27 B: so go back to the topic 

143.07 145.31 A: i know i know it's hard to stay on topic 

144.96 146.08 B: yes 

145.47 147.09 A: um i 

147.85 154.32 A: i don't know i think it would be great to have a [noise] a higher minimum wage for ah for workers 

147.93 148.69 B: so 

154.52 158.49 B: mhm oh that that's true um 

158.73 163.06 B: but to are you um a citizen here 

163.45 165.37 A: um yeah 

165.24 176.67 B: okay so do you familiar with the um this standard wage like how how much per month is the minimum do m- do you familiar with that 

165.56 166.71 A: yeah 

174.59 179.11 A: yeah yeah i think it's different yeah it's different state to state i think um 

178.32 180.01 B: oh yes that's true 

179.75 186.36 A: it's dif- ah i mean washington is about um i think about six dollars ninety cents almost seven dollars 

186.32 187.63 B: mhm 

187.00 188.35 A: um an hour 

188.26 190.04 B: mhm 

189.44 192.44 A: and i'm not sure where you are um 

192.71 196.83 A: my home state was pennsylvania and i i don't know what it is there either but it 

196.54 200.21 B: uh-huh well i think it's about the same here 

199.92 200.86 A: uh-huh 

200.81 205.14 B: and it's come it's close to um seven dollars per hour 

205.39 206.53 A: yeah 

205.98 214.21 B: um but i think if you really increased this amount by five dollars or something that that will be [lipsmack] 

214.72 217.50 B: you know a dramatic increase 

217.29 218.41 A: i agree 

218.15 220.03 B: yeah 

219.42 222.12 A: probably be too expensive for the employers 

221.95 224.92 B: [laughter] that i i i agree with you now 

225.87 226.94 B: yes 

226.95 227.51 B: (( [cough] )) 

227.39 233.69 A: you know some kind of increase is probably good but they can't they can't do it so so severely 

232.81 237.89 B: mhm yeah um 

236.83 239.40 A: i think it would be more valuable to have um 

239.76 243.42 A: something in the you know more health health benefits and things like this 

243.72 244.61 B: uh-huh 

244.83 245.74 A: um 

245.99 251.99 A: because it it doesn't even if you're making seven dollars if they increase it to eight dollars or even nine dollars 

251.67 252.89 B: mhm 

252.22 255.92 A: if that's all if that's all that you get in a month um 

256.23 259.39 A: it's still not going to be a very good standard of living 

259.35 260.85 B: mhm 

260.22 262.22 A: forty hours a week ah 

262.25 267.35 A: nine dollars an hour it still doesn't add up to very much i think it'd be more important to have some 

264.95 265.81 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

267.97 269.34 A: some benefits 

269.42 271.43 B: mhm 

271.87 282.75 B: that's true so do you think the increase can be made by several other ways like the insurance the the the benefits the s- 

283.02 285.62 B: i mean the s- social benefits 

285.77 288.54 A: mhm i think it could be more 

286.94 287.86 B: (( mm )) 

289.81 292.47 A: it could be more valuable i i don't know 

292.40 293.31 B: uh-huh 

293.78 294.86 B: i mean 

294.88 300.54 B: the the increase can be made by by many ways right 

299.92 306.03 A: right and well if the if you increase the wage eventually the companies have have to pay that 

302.57 303.79 B: (( mhm )) 

305.46 306.89 B: yes yes 

306.16 310.77 A: um insurance i would assume that maybe the company makes a contribution 

310.44 311.90 B: mhm yeah 

310.89 317.24 A: but also i would i would assume the government would maybe match the contribution [noise] or or help with that cost 

316.94 325.69 B: mhm mhm also another issue is that by increasing the wage wh- what what i mean what effect will 

326.02 328.28 B: (( will it bring to the whole )) 

328.68 336.09 B: whole industry whole whole commercial yeah [noise] and 

330.91 331.87 A: yeah 

335.46 338.12 A: well it it's i know 

337.14 338.25 B: also 

338.55 340.29 B: i think um 

341.48 350.83 B: what kind of effect will will it bring to the to the whole government government and this country i i think it's it's 

348.27 349.32 A: yeah 

352.06 354.87 B: i mean it's great to all the employees 

354.50 355.80 A: mhm 

355.32 366.75 B: but if it's practical to to this country i i'm not i'm not sure about that 

358.26 359.24 A: yeah i think 

366.13 372.06 A: yeah i don't i don't know if it i think it would be too too much too fast 

371.51 374.88 B: mhm yes i think it's too fast [laughter] 

374.62 381.76 A: for a lot of a lot of you know the small companies that only have ah you know a small number of workers 

381.28 382.54 B: mhm 

381.88 389.16 A: ah it's gonna make their cost too much al- already the cost of american labor is very high compared to other countries 

383.91 385.17 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

389.06 390.35 B: mhm yeah 

389.73 391.08 A: all and already w- 

391.46 392.69 A: there's more 

393.28 402.06 A: um you know manufacturing jobs and things like that going to other countries for for cheaper labor it would it would be even worse if if our minimum wage was raised 

395.42 396.29 B: mhm 

402.00 403.08 B: mhm 

403.82 405.23 B: also 

406.00 409.80 B: i'm concern concerning that if there's a 

410.58 419.36 B: say if you want to increase the wage of every employee you got to cut more persons from your your your your company 

417.45 418.39 A: yeah 

419.35 421.86 A: yeah you'd have to balance it have to have less people 

421.62 423.34 B: yes yes 

423.64 426.65 B: so you got to have more lay offs 

427.88 431.26 A: yeah of course and enough with enough of that already 

430.81 432.39 B: mhm 

432.46 441.60 B: yes that's true but anyway i think the wage wages standard here is already about a h- i mean in the states is already a very high rate 

440.98 442.56 A: it is yeah 

442.01 443.33 B: yeah 

442.66 444.09 A: it is even if you're 

444.43 450.69 A: ah you know poor in in this country you're probably poor with a refrigerator and and a car 

450.46 451.77 B: mhm 

451.10 454.68 A: um [laughter] and that's that's a lot better than a lot of places 

454.21 455.86 B: yes that's true 

456.29 459.55 A: in some ways you know it just it's hard to compare 

459.07 460.70 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

459.77 461.12 A: (( in truth but [noise] )) 

463.10 464.67 A: yeah 

464.83 468.01 A: it is um are you from another country 

467.56 470.54 B: mhm oh yes i'm from china how about you 

471.21 478.90 A: um well i'm i'm from pennsylvania um but i i lived in i lived in thailand for about three years

502.35 505.17 A: yeah but there you know it's ah very you 

505.18 506.67 A: know a very different place 

506.79 511.69 B: yeah and i bet that the wages from there is not as high as here 

511.60 513.67 A: no no certainly not 

513.11 515.26 B: [laughter] 

514.25 519.09 A: no certainly not it's very very different a lot of in a lot of ways

516.95 521.07 B: uh-huh that's ah mhm 

520.79 525.68 A: but yeah the expectations are are much lower there and i'm i'm i'm sure it's ah 

524.22 525.06 B: mhm 

526.17 527.76 A: quite the same in china 

527.65 529.32 B: yeah that's true 

530.02 540.47 B: that's true so have you have you ever been to some other countries and do you do you know some other countries' wage wage and conditions
