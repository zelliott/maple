0.33 2.24 A: hi this is rachel 

2.47 5.52 A: gonna talk to a person or you just talk the whole time 

4.96 8.92 B: uh no you get a person and my name is george mostdollar 

9.54 23.76 A: so um i'm a economics phd and the minimum wage is stupid and i could talk about that and how you shouldn't allow mar- you should allow markets to clear do you want me to i mean what's this for 

9.97 10.83 B: (( [cough] )) 

14.93 16.18 B: [laughter] 

23.47 29.02 B: uh who knows what it's for it's some study about how people talk to each other i think 

29.07 30.68 A: okay 

29.79 36.50 B: because i i last time i i got this i the topic was uh censorship in 

36.72 39.19 B: schools whether schools should uh 

39.44 40.31 B: uh 

40.62 43.92 B: uh control what books students read 

44.42 46.50 A: okay so 

46.03 49.02 B: so the topic is not really what they're studying 

48.75 61.95 A: yes so minimum wage is stupid if it's a binding restriction because then you have people who um aren't worth five dol- and fifteen cents an hour who are doing stuff for zero cents an hour i.e. nothing 

62.20 65.21 A: maybe even selling drugs which is worth negative 

65.76 69.62 B: well you don't get paid minimum wage for selling drugs 

65.87 67.04 A: yeah 

69.42 70.88 A: you actually do 

71.11 72.64 B: well you probably ma- 

71.73 74.79 A: th- they've done studies they're paid a- 

75.17 77.12 A: a- around minimum wage 

78.67 82.05 A: the top people make more but most of the street people 

82.23 84.55 A: bout that same as that or mcdonald's 

85.20 86.37 B: really 

85.84 86.67 A: (( yeah )) 

86.47 88.57 B: [cough] they get paid by the hour 

87.01 87.69 A: (( w- )) 

88.66 99.80 A: i don't know exactly how they get paid but they live with their mothers drive beat up cars if they have cars that type of stuff not to lifestyles of the rich and famous 

99.99 106.58 B: so you think there's any job in the world that's worth being paid less then five dollars and fifteen cents an hour for 

107.76 111.88 A: most of the world is working at those jobs where do you think your shoes came from 

112.33 113.50 B: yes well 

112.58 114.58 A: most people just don't have ski- 

113.55 114.37 B: (( [cough] )) 

114.85 128.34 A: many people just don't have skills worth five dollars an hour fortunately in united states we're rich enough that i- that five dollars an hour isn't much of a restriction so there isn't much unemployment but if you did five dollars an hour in indonesia everybody would be starving 

129.53 131.18 B: well that's probably true 

132.82 136.43 B: but it would be nice if we could get the standard of living up everywhere 

136.81 141.67 A: mm to do that you need to have people with skills worth five dollars an hour 

136.84 137.41 B: (( [cough] )) 

141.83 146.05 A: otherwise you're just gonna have them working for no- no- not working and starving 

146.49 150.20 A: but it'd be nice yeah if everybody was worth five dollars an hour 

150.30 154.85 A: that would basically solve most of world's true poverty 

154.73 157.88 B: to me five dollar's an hour is like nothing 

157.39 161.73 A: yeah but you still live better than humanity did throughout all of history 

158.46 159.58 B: i mean you could 

160.13 166.12 B: stu- stu- stu- stuffing envelopes you deserve a minimum of five dollars an hour if not more 

166.48 168.14 B: that's how it seems to me 

166.75 177.79 A: for five dollars an hour you could buy a place to live and food wi- in both of them are better quality and people have go- gotten all except the kings throughout history you just don't 

178.34 181.28 A: we're just very fortunate to be much richer now 

182.58 183.95 B: well that's true 

184.25 186.53 B: well you're a phd 

185.97 187.51 A: in economics 

187.20 188.10 B: really 

188.28 190.01 B: where where where 

189.34 191.15 A: university of chicago 

190.84 192.15 B: (( chicago huh well )) 

192.40 199.40 A: but whatever in the united states five dollars an hour is- doesn't make much of a difference because people'll get paid about that anyway 

200.67 208.77 A: but in illinois they just raised it to six fifty which is truly stupid because uh in a recession you don't do 

200.69 201.56 B: well you 

211.00 214.42 B: maybe right about that the uh 

217.04 220.83 B: i don't know i'm pretty much in favor in free market forces but i 

221.10 223.99 B: it seems to me that past uh 

222.59 225.21 A: (( that )) 

224.29 228.68 B: experience seems to indicate that you can't trust 

228.72 231.79 B: the uh bosses the 

231.81 237.04 B: capitalist overlords to regulate themselves in any kind of fair way 

235.45 245.40 A: of course not they would prefer to pay workers as little as possible but they have to get workers if i if i'm being paid three dollars an hour and you and i'm worth four dollars an hour 

245.48 249.61 A: then it's likely somebody will offer me a job because then they 

249.78 253.82 A: get at three fifty 'cause then they get a fifty cent profit 

253.58 255.20 B: in a in a recession 

255.33 261.97 A: well not in a recession of course but in recession that means that people aren't as valuable for whatever reason 

262.96 265.09 B: hm 

264.11 265.05 A: but 

265.77 266.76 A: it won't 

267.80 275.93 A: but in the united states i don't think that minimum wage is a binding restriction there really aren't that many people who were worth less than five dollars an hour 

275.94 280.74 B: no i mean fi i like i like said five dollars an hour to me it's like 

276.90 278.04 A: (( it's a )) 

281.08 289.31 B: is nothing you you could i couldn't rent an apartment in philadelphia which is where i live for five dollars an hour much less pay bills 

289.33 291.69 A: well yes and no you can 

291.83 295.61 A: you can you can live on it but you just couldn't live well you can 

295.67 306.91 A: have room mates i mean i have a lot of friends who are college students who are living on ah less than ten thousand a year you have to have room mates and you have to eat shit 

307.34 316.05 A: and granted college students' h- have their parents to rely on but you can live on it you just can't live well and you can't live as an adult really 

315.63 319.54 B: no and and i'm a single parent with children 

318.99 321.18 A: well that makes it a lot harder 

321.49 324.19 A: 'cause you have to pay for childcare is um 

321.79 322.44 B: (( [cough] )) 

323.90 325.18 B: (( yes i do [cough] )) 

327.41 331.94 B: luckily my skills are worth a little more than five dollars an hour 

332.46 333.94 B: luckily 

336.07 339.94 A: but whatever it's truly unfortunate when people don't 

339.97 340.97 A: are 

341.14 346.35 A: so uneducated or so dysfunctional they're liver isn't worth very much but 

346.85 349.63 A: there are other ways to deal with that problem than 

349.70 354.32 A: assuming the the make losses if they employ them 

354.66 355.46 A: (( 'cause )) 

356.58 360.24 A: and some people ju- m- maybe sh- are unemployable 

360.42 361.79 B: well that's true 

361.29 363.07 A: but 

363.03 366.05 B: and that's why we have disability and welfare 

366.25 366.96 A: yep 

366.82 368.79 B: [laughter] 

369.65 370.81 B: (( uh of )) 

371.30 381.72 B: course it'd be nice if we could uh maybe get the education system going so that uh everyone uh we could raise the general level of skills and knowledge to a point where uh 

381.14 384.64 A: (( if you our education system the problem is )) 

381.96 383.63 B: mo- mo- m- w- [cough] 

385.29 392.97 A: the problem is you have people who don't take advantage and cultures that prevent people who want to from doing it by beating them up if they're smart or 

393.42 394.19 A: let 

394.20 399.04 A: bad teachers just go around what we need is t- to solve the schools 

397.07 398.28 B: well that's the 

398.41 403.72 B: that's the legacy of of reganism is anti-intellectualism 

403.37 414.01 A: th- that i very much doubt regan has impossibly caused the black under c- class uh anti-intellectualism like they're not reganistic 

411.51 412.23 B: (( cu- )) 

413.37 418.34 B: cut cut huge amounts of money to the public schools lower 

417.29 423.98 A: uh the federal government provides only a tiny percentage of the money to the public sch- a small percent it's not tiny 

423.85 424.65 B: oh 

424.65 430.70 A: i mean it's uh i don't know what it is but i don't think you can blame it on regan changing the culture 'cause 

430.76 433.23 A: like why would american blacks 

433.47 436.31 A: reference themselves by regan they're democrats 

437.50 439.68 A: it's the evil teachers' unions 

439.54 441.44 B: the evil teachers' unions 

439.79 444.77 A: they won- they won't let they won't let incompetent teachers be fired 

445.12 448.13 B: well that's not right there should be a 

448.96 453.84 B: i mean obviously i believe there should be degree requirements if you're gonna be a teacher 

453.40 462.27 A: well not just degree requirements there should be if you there should be better requirements than not not sle- than not sleeping with the students 

462.47 465.94 A: uh for keeping your job maybe you should teach them something 

464.23 465.53 B: (( [noise] )) 

465.97 467.58 A: once you got tenure 

466.06 466.90 B: yeah 

468.79 471.42 B: did they give tenure in public schools 

470.86 472.13 A: (( yes )) 

472.61 481.08 A: like it's much worse in academic tenure because once if you've spent ten years of your life really working very very hard on something 

481.12 489.41 A: that weeds out all but the really dedicated most of the time so even though people have guaranteed employment they tend to do an okay job 

489.25 490.26 B: right 

489.68 493.72 A: and public schools you just have to work there for two years and then 

494.04 500.54 A: as long as you don't commit a crime and you show up i think you're pretty much unfirable 

500.32 506.52 B: you know that i that that's not right i mean that shouldn't be how things are 

501.45 502.12 A: you 

506.12 511.33 A: it certainly makes it hard for teachers to be threatened about anything 

514.31 515.14 B: hm 

516.32 517.86 B: well that's interesting 

516.56 519.13 A: and they can't pay the good teachers more 

521.85 525.19 B: what you mean reward them for actually doing a good job 

524.68 527.55 A: may- it's very difficult to do that 

526.84 529.24 B: no of course it is because of uh 

529.46 535.32 B: i'm sure if there's any rewards at all it's for seniority and that's just a percentage every year of 

532.57 533.32 A: (( yep )) 

535.97 538.41 B: of whatever the base salary is 

539.54 540.80 A: (( but [sigh] )) 

542.62 546.34 A: even with our incompetent teachers most people in the united states can 

546.47 559.48 A: read and write and do that type of thing and that makes them worth more than five dollars an hour of course i would be happy to import immigrants and pay them as little as possible 'cause whatever we pay them is cheaper is better than what they get at home 

559.75 561.55 A: you know wanna come here 

561.17 566.94 B: well there's an awful lot of people who seem to think that would be taking jobs away from uh red blooded americans 

566.92 569.62 A: there's not a fixed supply of jobs 

570.74 577.41 A: i'm sure red blooded americans would like cheaper foods um to have nannies of their own etc etc 

578.35 580.88 B: hm a nanny that's an idea 

579.41 582.24 A: [noise] [noise] yes 

581.08 583.76 B: i c- i could go to a movie [laughter] 

582.91 586.12 A: if you could have a nanny for five dollars an hour 

586.75 590.50 A: that would be cheaper than i bet what you're paying for now for childcare 

590.64 592.51 B: uh yes it would 

592.03 594.22 A: and i bet you ha- 

594.29 595.86 A: and i bet uh 

596.40 599.89 A: i can't say you'd do a better job but i have no idea where you're putting your kids now
