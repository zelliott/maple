0.33 2.38 B: hi my name is monica 

2.09 5.04 A: hi monica my name's melanie how you doing 

4.46 6.15 B: i'm good how are you 

5.70 7.56 A: good where are you calling from 

7.05 8.56 B: from new york 

7.99 10.69 A: oh okay i'm calling from boston 

10.28 12.73 B: oh okay both east coast 

10.95 14.84 A: yeah are you are you right in new york city or 

14.45 16.39 B: yeah right in manhattan 

15.15 15.82 A: (( oh )) 

16.00 18.46 A: oh nice nice 

16.81 17.87 B: so 

18.05 21.83 B: yeah um this is actually my first call [laughter] 

20.49 24.89 A: oh excellent [laughter] so 

21.85 22.88 B: yeah 

22.98 26.67 B: yeah so what do you feel about the minimum wage 

26.35 35.65 A: [lipsmack] well i definitely think it's um not a liveable wage and i think that there's a big difference between the minimum wage and liveable wage and i think that 

35.98 48.14 A: the minimum wage definitely can't cover the needs of somebody to live especially like in a big city um [lipsmack] you know what they need to pay for rent it's not equitable so 

47.91 49.03 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

48.42 52.17 A: i'm not sure what what you've found there but 

51.95 61.57 B: yeah i mean i i definitely feel the same way i think a lot of people do live with their parents or whatever if they can only get the minimum wage because they just can't afford it 

57.32 58.41 A: right 

61.51 70.60 B: you know like i know there's one girl in our work and she's making about twelve dollars an hour and she still is qualified for low income housing for this city 

66.32 67.30 A: okay 

69.48 70.67 A: oh wow 

70.67 84.29 B: yeah and um so her boyfriend lives with her and probably is making seven dollars an hour so still a couple of dollars above minimum wage and he would never be able to afford his own place you know even with low income housing 

81.50 82.68 A: sure 

84.03 85.16 A: right 

84.54 96.23 B: so and actually the two of them live together in a place that just she's supposed to be in technically but they she couldn't really afford it on her own either [laughter] even though she's making twelve dollars 

90.49 91.47 A: okay 

93.98 95.96 A: right right even 

96.04 100.19 A: even though it's a it's funded through the the state you said 

99.79 102.42 B: through the city i think yeah 

100.69 105.63 A: through the city and even that she couldn't afford with oh my goodness 

103.33 104.55 B: right 

105.16 106.47 B: yeah 

105.74 106.92 A: wow 

106.79 118.72 B: well to get you know even like a studio i'm sure it's probably about the same in boston but even like far out you know like for about an hour commute and um a studio is still like you know 

111.66 112.63 A: right 

118.68 122.53 B: six hundred or seven hundred dollars is kind of like the minimum you can pay 

120.45 121.74 A: definitely 

122.60 128.09 A: yeah boston is just ridiculous like if you live anywhere in the metro system like 

123.22 124.17 B: (( so [noise] )) 

128.09 136.37 A: um you know for a studio you're going to pay like nine fifty a month you know and i'm sure i'm sure manhattan's crazier um 

131.78 132.89 B: yeah 

136.33 147.35 A: but it's just yeah so even if you live in a lower income area um it's still up there you know like they're still for a one bedroom you're going to pay around a thousand dollars 

143.32 144.37 B: yeah 

147.05 148.26 B: right 

147.41 152.10 A: so and that's in a low income area so it's it's crazy i don't know how 

152.21 161.14 A: why it um [lipsmack] how the how the housing market can be so high if people are making such low um incomes so it's interesting 

160.82 167.17 B: yeah well i just realised i have never actually figured out what minimum wage if you're making minimum wage 

167.31 170.52 B: and you're working forty hours a week 

170.63 173.54 B: and fifty two weeks a year even 

173.70 175.03 A: like what that would [mn] 

174.79 178.54 B: yeah it's ten thousand seven hundred and twelve dollars 

178.43 180.65 A: wow can you imagine right 

179.34 187.69 B: yeah and that's without taxes so you assume that they would be getting minimum taxes so say fifteen percent 

185.51 186.35 A: right 

187.89 189.65 B: of that would be 

190.39 194.74 B: [mn] one thousand six hundred and six dollars and eight cents off the top 

194.76 199.63 B: so they'd have about nine thousand dollars a year to live on if they were just making the minimum wage 

199.30 210.41 A: right wow and i i guess the people that i think of a lot is like if i if you were in high school and you're making that well it's kind of extra money you know what i mean like you're not 

208.14 209.25 B: right 

210.73 215.65 A: that's not for living expenses and that when like i think okay like 

215.58 227.25 A: five ten an hour or six bucks an hour is fine for like a high school student that is just kind of making spending money you know what i mean but like i think a lot of i'm a social worker in boston 

222.90 224.03 B: right 

226.87 227.81 B: uh-huh 

227.13 233.81 A: and so i think a ton about um working with immigrant populations and a lot of the jobs they get um 

234.66 244.20 A: that th- they're able to apply for are going to be minimum wage jobs you know whether that's factory work or something that you don't have to 

244.12 255.83 A: um deal with language barriers and that kind of thing um and there's no you know and they come with sometimes like three kids or pregnant spouse or pregnant significant other 

255.71 265.18 A: and i mean it's just ridiculous and then they don't have access to housing you know through the the government either because of their status 

264.71 266.10 B: oh yeah 

265.13 275.92 A: um and it's just you know it's it's a terrible situation so i think a lot about that that type of person when i think about needing like a liveable wage versus you know a minimum 

274.38 275.34 B: yeah 

276.04 288.23 A: you said that even your friend that you were talking about your co worker that's really yeah that's you know a similar situation where you're like yeah we need this to live on [laughter] you know this isn't like extra cash you know [laughter] so 

284.17 285.27 B: yeah 

286.49 294.80 B: right yeah exactly so do the immigrant population do they end up sharing small apartments with a lot of people kind of 

293.71 296.64 A: yeah definitely like a lot of the 

296.60 308.67 A: families that i've done home visits with um you know they'll have cousins extended a lot of them are extended families that just you know so one will migrate here immigrate here 

308.52 316.29 A: and get a job and get an apartment and get somewhat established and then a grandma will come a nephew will come a cousin 

316.13 327.32 A: you know but the only place they can come is where that apartment is and i was visiting a family and you know it's a two bedroom apartment and a family of five was in one bedroom 

327.20 340.70 A: and a family of like three or like kind of like a cousin and a grandma and um somebody else but within the extended family was in the other bedroom so you're we have like nine people in a two bedroom 

340.89 342.67 A: city apartment 

342.10 348.39 B: wow that's like the old tenements in new york you know where there [laughter] were like twenty people in a two bedroom or something 

342.82 343.80 A: you know 

344.61 346.11 A: yeah 

347.84 350.20 A: i- isn't that amazing you know 

349.11 350.56 B: wow 

350.09 363.52 A: and that's not like there's a lot of living space you know outside the bedrooms either you know so you have a little kitchenette and a little area where you can have like a table and a couch or something but it's not like big spacious rooms in between 

360.25 361.27 B: mhm 

363.26 364.30 B: yeah 

363.66 373.17 A: but um so it's it's really interesting to see how yeah that affects but i when when did it last go up the minimum wage to five fifteen 

372.86 375.93 B: you know i was thinking it had been a while um 

374.86 377.79 A: yeah so since clinton for sure 

377.27 380.89 B: yeah that's what i thought as well um 

379.75 385.91 A: so and who knows with bush i don't know [laughter] if you're a bush um [laughter] advocate or not but [laughter] 

383.37 384.56 B: oh i 

384.70 396.06 B: you know i actually i used to be strong democrat and now i'm not strong republic i'm kind of i kind of feel like there's not easy answers you know 

389.22 390.23 A: okay 

395.12 397.44 A: right that's definitely true 

396.39 404.36 B: so yeah so now i'm more [laughter] i just hope that whatever party is in you know that they'll do good things too 

400.05 401.40 A: kind of in the middle 

403.34 415.22 A: right right i guess i just don't have that much confidence that during his term we're going to get like a raise in the minimum wage [laughter] but who knows maybe i'll be surprised so [laughter] 

404.78 405.91 B: yeah 

411.09 412.56 B: yeah 

414.51 424.52 B: no i it's funny because the republicans had the different agenda like they wanna lower the taxes but they don't raise the minimum wage which might be more helpful [laughter] or you know 

419.62 420.72 A: right 

423.39 424.50 A: sure 

424.55 432.53 B: so it's it's interesting that way um you know that they wanna lower the taxes but not you know increase the social services 

427.04 428.23 A: yeah 

431.98 433.20 A: right 

432.50 440.48 B: even you know like if you consider a minimum wage being a social service because then at least it guarantees what people will get but 

436.35 437.47 A: right 

439.64 449.35 A: right and just raising people's dignity too about what they're able to afford and i mean a lot of families that are you know so they're collecting food stamps or they're collecting 

442.72 443.78 B: yeah 

449.24 459.65 A: you know other benefits like it's not that they want to be but it's like the job you know what i mean like if the minimum wage could go up and [noise] cer- you know certain groups of people would be able to 

454.18 455.31 B: yeah 

459.50 466.12 A: get off the food stamps and that kind of thing that would be really empowering to them as well you know what i mean 

464.85 466.00 B: yeah 

466.05 471.24 B: yeah 'cause there is a stigma using the food stamps and yeah i know 

466.36 467.10 A: so 

467.93 468.88 A: yeah 

469.02 470.26 A: yeah 

471.26 482.90 B: yeah i was thinking back um when i started my first little job i was only fifteen and so they could al- they could pay below the minimum wage i think if it was you know like after school work 

476.97 477.98 A: okay 

481.85 483.71 A: yeah yeah 

483.01 488.83 B: so i think it was like two twenty an hour and at that time i think minimum wage was like three fifteen or something like that 

488.36 489.53 A: wow 

488.92 499.79 B: and now or whatever but you know for me like you said it was an after school job so it was you know guaranteed you know making that much money and it was it was great 

499.49 500.60 A: sure 

499.99 503.98 B: but yeah if you're trying to provide for realistic you know 

504.04 508.03 A: to raise a family or to put a roof over your head 

504.30 505.46 B: gotta take 

507.56 511.42 B: yeah yeah it doesn't seem to make 

508.47 510.52 A: that is that is hard 

511.36 518.03 B: and then the other thing too is what i was thinking about we were talking about walmart um another woman in my work has stock 

516.81 517.63 A: okay 

517.93 528.48 B: and so she was saying what a good stock it was and i said yeah but like you know in the little town where my mom and my sisters live the walmart's come in you know it's a town of about ten thousand people 

528.33 539.97 B: so the walmart's come in and she can go by there and buy all these things really cheaply but all of the local businesses are going out of business 'cause they can't compete but then walmart does pay its workers minimum wage 

539.84 547.18 B: so they're not even good jobs you know like the local people who don't have their own businesses that might go to work at walmart it's not 

542.38 543.12 A: (( yeah right )) 

547.21 553.52 B: you know it's it's not even in you know it's not the same it's it's that nobody's really making that much money 

550.54 551.77 A: sure 

553.61 557.15 B: um in the local communities you know the walmart 

555.53 556.55 A: (( sure sure )) 

557.88 561.58 B: corporation is and theoretically the stockholders are too 

562.15 564.70 B: but um yeah 

564.09 572.15 A: that that is something that comes up so often you know like within social work with community development type issues is that 

571.98 580.83 A: yeah so a lot of local businesses then aren't getting supported which brings money right back into the community if there's local owners 

580.37 581.47 B: right 

580.72 590.26 A: um because they're also spending money in the community and getting money from the community but then with these huge corporate organizations there's um 

590.58 599.89 A: you know they're they're giving yeah they they sell themselves by saying we'll we'll bring all these new jobs into your community so because we're a big or-
