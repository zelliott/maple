0.40 1.61 A: (( hello )) 

1.45 3.20 B: hi i'm gerry 

2.86 4.44 A: my name is christian 

4.59 5.86 B: hey christian 

5.46 6.60 A: where do you live 

6.80 8.57 B: pittsburgh how 'bout yourself 

7.93 9.35 A: i'm in chicago 

9.04 10.16 B: (( oh )) 

10.73 11.51 A: so 

11.86 14.67 A: so uh have you ever worked for minimum wage 

14.74 17.52 B: uh not since i was a kid no [laughter] 

16.51 20.17 A: yeah w- um where did you work 

20.38 21.65 B: at a restaurant 

21.25 24.71 A: yeah was it a fast food restaurant or 

24.36 26.03 B: no uh-uh no 

25.43 26.25 A: (( oh )) 

26.34 27.57 B: how 'bout you 

27.59 34.07 A: uh yeah my first job was at kentucky fried chicken and i think at that point minimum wage was 

34.25 39.09 A: maybe four fifteen or something like that pretty low 

38.07 43.83 B: oh wow i think it was two something when i did it [laughter] 

40.35 45.59 A: [laughter] so 

44.61 48.21 B: so what's the topic here is it minimum wage is gonna do what 

48.52 56.86 A: oh i think it is if um the raise to the minimum of the minimum wage to five fifteen is fair 

56.87 59.69 A: or sufficient in today's economy 

60.13 63.62 A: and uh i i don't think it is [laughter] how 'bout you 

63.47 66.32 B: uh i i think it might be 

66.02 67.31 A: (( really uh-huh [noise] )) 

66.66 72.47 B: uh 'cause what i'm what i'm assuming on this is that you know and of course this is uh an assumption 

72.60 81.59 B: two things uh the minimum wage i don't know how many people actually raise families with that but i'll hope none i'm assuming it's like you and i did it's kids out working 

81.60 83.06 B: summer jobs 

83.27 88.03 B: and it but i think the big thing and they're pushing this from i understand a lot of uh 

88.11 96.93 B: uh labor union contracts or uh their percentage of wages uh or raises are pegged to increases in the minimum wage 

96.29 97.22 A: uh-huh 

97.13 100.38 B: so i don't think it's an issue of is the minimum wage enough 

100.57 105.13 B: how many people actually work for that maybe somebody ought to do a study and figure out how many 

100.65 101.61 A: right 

105.63 112.07 B: how many people actually who are family breadwinners work for this because i don't think there's that many you couldn't possibly 

107.07 108.20 A: (( yeah i )) 

109.20 110.84 A: yeah 

111.06 123.11 A: i i disagree i mean if you look at the fast food industry especially they employ a lot of immigrants or a lot of people well it gives a lot of people a chance to work but i think most of those people are 

123.13 128.16 A: people who can't get uh work elsewhere so i think they're somewhat exploited 

128.23 136.64 A: and uh i mean could you imagine trying to raise a family on five fifteen an hour i mean after after taxes it'd be 

134.31 135.86 B: oh absolutely not 

136.29 148.12 B: absolutely not well i i think at that point the taxes are a moot point i think you're talking earned income tax credit uh i don't think there is a a tax taken on that uh but be that as it may um 

148.77 163.33 B: there's no way in in god's green earth you could try to do anything with a family on that uh i think it's even foolish to try at that point you're probably better off going another route like welfare would probably pay better than minimum wage i think 

153.60 154.58 A: right 

161.74 172.81 A: right w- with the costs associated with having your your childcare or whatever while you're working would probably be more than actually staying at home 

170.49 171.70 B: well yeah 

172.14 176.27 B: yeah an- and at that point too you know you talk about raising the minimum wage 

176.12 189.64 B: wh- at what point then do you and i no longer feel we can afford to go out and buy our lunch at k._f._c. or mcdonald's or whatever at five bucks an hour at seven bucks an hour obviously this is reflected in the price of the goods 

183.67 184.85 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

189.48 190.48 A: right 

189.85 191.75 B: so at what point do 

191.82 194.88 B: minimum wage jobs price the products 

195.68 197.42 A: yeah i see what you're saying 

196.34 200.01 B: there's there's only so much that i'm willing to spend to go and have lunch out 

199.90 200.89 A: uh-huh 

201.03 203.76 B: and you know if if the 

204.34 206.68 B: people working there are making 

207.21 216.11 B: and i don't know what the figure would be seven dollars an hour whatever it is uh and you've gotta double the cost of the lunch or whatever sorry i'm out 

209.10 209.99 A: (( yeah )) 

214.40 215.39 A: (( yeah )) 

215.90 216.95 A: right 

216.22 223.08 B: so now it'll just become counterproductive now the job may pay as much but there's only a third as many jobs 

218.79 219.88 A: right 

222.74 224.55 A: mhm 

223.71 224.74 B: (( so i don't know )) 

224.96 234.91 A: i don't know i just read a book called the fast food nation and it talks about the fast food industry mostly and i can't really think of many other people who pay minimum wage these days can you 

235.36 243.56 B: hm probably things like car washes um you know stuff like that ga- you know uh kids pumping gas or whatever 

238.48 239.77 A: yeah 

242.58 244.45 A: right yeah 

243.70 249.64 B: uh but i tell you what i think minimum wage is kinda neat for and i see a lot of the like and i'm sure that probably probably what they make 

249.66 255.02 B: when you go to like the local walmart's whatever you see the the retired guys and and women in there 

253.73 254.78 A: yeah 

254.84 256.15 A: yeah 

255.34 265.01 B: you know and and to me that's it's that and teenagers who should be working for minimum wage because they're supplementing their income which is cool and they're getting outta the house 

264.36 266.05 A: right 

265.35 276.93 B: and the kids frankly are learning a worth ec- work ethic and how many kids at sixteen have to support themselves you know they're at home with mom and dad or whatever and and saving towards 

268.21 269.09 A: uh-huh 

271.36 272.47 A: yeah 

277.17 281.36 B: um be it something for school or for a car or whatever 

281.08 282.63 A: (( mhm )) 

281.89 293.54 B: and uh like i say at that point oh i'm not sure i i i'm not sure that raising it is uh is the answer because as i say once you and i can't afford to go have lunch they're not gonna have a job 

291.57 292.79 A: [laughter] 

293.53 294.73 A: that's true 

295.13 302.17 A: well maybe if the the frant- the franchise owners cut their profits a little bit in order to train people properly 

301.91 305.84 B: you have a better chance of seeing god [laughter] 

303.51 306.70 A: [laughter] 

305.99 314.81 B: ain't gonna happen [laughter] uh h- how many business owners do you know have said oh yeah i'll take less here you have more [laughter] 

307.14 309.93 A: yeah it's true i mean uh 

313.67 317.47 A: [laughter] doesn't happen too often does it [laughter] i 

316.77 318.67 B: no no not a bit 

317.88 319.51 A: (( mean but that th- that's what we're )) 

320.55 322.19 B: (( mhm )) 

321.45 322.45 A: (( stuck with you know )) 

323.13 331.01 A: well a lot of these uh a lot of these fast food restaurants are breaking a lot of labor laws for example 

331.00 340.16 A: if you're under i think it's if if you're under eighteen you can only work so many hours on a school night and a lot of these hours are going uh 

340.39 351.68 A: uh they're they're c- convincing their workers not to report certain hours and they're keeping them just under forty hours so they don't have to pay you know health insurance or anything like that so 

346.60 347.58 B: (( [cough] )) 

350.94 351.97 B: oh really 

351.88 352.84 A: yeah 

353.34 357.88 B: that that stunk 'cause i know when i was in high school i had a job working uh 

358.07 360.68 B: uh and frankly i wasn't even old enough to work 

360.46 361.32 A: uh-huh 

360.69 375.26 B: um and when the you know somebody would come downstairs and you know the state inspector is upstairs and they'd ship us all out and put us on a bus and send us back home [laughter] [laughter] this goes back into the sixties and we just went like we didn't have anything and we were glad to get the job 

365.79 367.33 A: [laughter] 

368.63 370.67 A: oh you're kidding me 

372.28 373.46 A: yeah 

374.89 375.80 A: yeah 

375.18 384.79 B: but uh you know and it was the same deal was minimum wage and i think at that point uh i don't even think it was two dollars an hour at that point um 

383.08 384.81 A: [laughter] 

385.73 390.45 B: but you know it was the same thing we it was a bunch of kids uh 

389.23 390.16 A: (( mhm )) 

390.84 394.23 B: and you know typically 

394.83 402.34 B: kids don't get benefits they don't get h- health care i mean typically they're covered under their parents anyway if they're in school or whatever 

398.37 399.92 A: right 

401.93 403.21 A: mhm 

402.65 409.65 B: and and i think that's why the kids and the older folks are getting these jobs the older folks have got medicare and they're supplement or whatever 

408.82 410.55 A: right 

409.89 411.16 B: and um 

412.56 413.83 B: [sigh] you know 

414.46 420.30 B: sometimes you know you like to you think that these people are getting over and maybe they are to a degree 

419.87 421.15 A: yeah 

421.09 422.35 B: uh 

422.95 427.20 B: but to raise the minimum wage 

427.47 434.23 B: arbitrarily like that is sort of akin to saying well let's spend ourselves into prosperity and i don't think that works 

432.75 433.64 A: (( [laughter] )) 

433.89 435.21 A: mhm 

434.74 437.94 B: otherwise i'd be way rich [laughter] 

436.67 440.27 A: [laughter] what kind of business are you in now 

439.92 441.57 B: uh i'm a funeral director 

441.25 442.35 A: (( oh wow )) 

442.24 443.30 B: how 'bout you 

443.34 444.72 A: uh i'm a teacher 

444.82 448.10 B: oh okay what uh what level of school do you teach 

445.63 446.44 A: so 

447.50 453.20 A: i actually teach english as a foreign language so i have a lot of interaction with um 

452.36 455.35 B: you teach that to a lot of american kids [laughter] 

454.35 465.93 A: [laughter] yeah that's true i actually get a lot of uh recent immigrants so a lot of my students are working at mcdonald's you know forty hours a week or whatever and trying to 

464.50 467.45 B: so what about their parents are they doing the same thing 

467.19 468.83 A: (( uh a )) 

467.54 469.83 B: since you you probably know more about 

468.91 479.79 A: a lot of the parents are still at home and they're sending money home i mean this is their way of you know they're not just supporting themselves they're you know they're sending a lot of money home i get a lot of uh 

480.09 487.57 A: uh we have a l- large influx of latinos so they have uh a lot of puerto ricans and a lot of um mexicans that i teach 

486.45 487.24 B: wh- 

487.20 501.63 B: what kind of jobs are they doing of course you know you're in chicago and uh i don't necessarily see a lot of that in pittsburgh but if you have a large immigrant latino community what types of jobs are they doing and and what kind of money do they make 

493.93 495.79 A: yeah 

497.07 498.95 A: mhm 

501.03 507.70 A: they're they're basically working restaurant jobs not just fast food but a lot of the the higher end 

507.31 508.39 B: mhm 

507.77 510.83 A: restaurants downtown they're working in the kitchen 

511.17 517.35 A: um and they're making up you know minimum wage or you know not much more than minimum wage 

517.40 527.94 A: so so i see a lot of a lot of people relying on minimum wage and and in fact also supporting families you know in their home countries so 

528.08 533.99 A: and i see them i see they have a lot of enthusiasm and they're coming to these free english courses 

534.31 543.83 A: you know at at these evening courses so they've had a full day to day of work and they come to class just you know falling asleep and exhausted but still 

537.40 538.20 B: mhm 

543.87 550.03 A: you know they're still in class and it just says a lot about 'em you know that they're actually 

546.22 547.08 B: yeah 

550.07 555.68 B: uh you know and and that's as as pathetic as it sounds it's good because as you look back uh 

555.78 563.20 B: uh even prior to when people had minimum wage to work for wave after wave of immigrants came in did basically the same thing 

559.42 560.11 A: (( mm )) 

562.92 564.86 A: right no that's true 

563.64 574.40 B: and they they didn't come in and the first generation in did not go to work and make big money they lifted their following generation up they lifted their children up which is what we all try to do 

571.59 573.44 A: mhm 

574.11 575.26 A: (( yeah )) 

574.78 575.77 B: um 

576.85 577.81 B: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

578.08 581.60 B: i don't know i think i'm gonna stick by my guns i i i don't 

579.89 582.00 A: [laughter] good for you 

581.63 589.54 B: i don't think raising the minimum wage is gonna do anything other than drive these people out of work and price me out of the 

589.60 595.36 B: whatever market it is whether it be the the restaurants or the you know 

591.32 592.88 A: right 

595.86 599.89 B: uh my god just what we need is another gas price increase if they if they 

598.75 599.89 A: [laughter]
