198.07 199.13 B: oh really

370.32 370.88 B: (( [noise] )) 

371.48 372.43 B: um 

372.83 374.28 B: through the internet 

373.78 376.59 A: did you my mom told me about it she does it too 

376.49 380.75 B: oh really do they call you all the time or it's just like three times 

377.00 378.44 A: yes she did one 

379.84 385.35 A: i think yeah i think she said like three times a week but we have two different phone lines 

384.99 385.97 B: uh-huh 

385.19 398.77 A: so some peo- sometimes they call on my phone like like you did and one called me yesterday and it was life partners but i was i was scared to do it i was like i don't know what to say mom and she was like okay she's like well i was like well they listen to you 

391.89 393.30 B: (( yeah mm )) 

395.65 397.33 B: mhm 

398.64 402.01 A: so then she did it and i listened to her and then 

398.96 400.18 B: mhm 

401.37 402.27 B: mhm 

402.16 405.17 A: it was okay so it's kind of weird 

403.89 404.54 B: (( um )) 

404.59 408.27 B: how much do they um do they really pay you and stuff or 

407.81 420.08 A: i think so i don't know i think my mom started doing it but she said for like ten minutes you get ten bucks but you can only do like three a week and i don't think she's got a check yet or not i don't know if she has 

418.27 419.45 B: oh 

420.14 420.96 B: (( okay )) 

421.01 421.86 A: (( [noise] i know )) 

421.02 427.23 B: well we have to get back to the subject i guess [laughter] getting back to the subject 

426.38 427.72 A: yeah 

427.41 438.01 B: um so what do i feel about minimum wage increase basically [sigh] yeah i mean if it's less than five dollars there definitely should be some type of increase but 

438.17 440.98 B: th- the minimum wage shouldn't be too high 

441.14 444.91 B: because if it is then that's what everybody would just 

444.98 453.98 B: work and live off of just minimum wage and not have to feel like they have to work or study any harder you know what i mean 

446.34 447.81 A: yeah 

453.56 461.69 A: yeah but then 'cause to a lot like seven dollars an hour i think that's not too bad to make but 

454.33 455.80 B: but 

460.55 462.10 B: yeah that's fair 

461.69 471.24 A: but the cost of living that's what i was saying the cost of living out there is different so making seven dollars an hour might not be too good to live in california but to make like 

470.25 479.50 B: yeah but then a lot of people should not depend on the minimum wage i i mean i feel like they shouldn't depend on the minimum wage to even 

474.85 476.13 A: (( yeah ex- )) 

479.51 483.27 B: make a living you know they should have had some funds 

480.42 482.10 A: exactly 

483.13 496.70 B: prior to that sometime in school they i'm not going to work for a minimum wage you know maybe just i think minimum wage is more for like teenagers yeah like you know those going through college or or you know 

484.92 487.49 A: and try to get some kind of experience 

488.34 489.62 A: yeah 

495.00 496.50 A: mhm 

496.66 507.09 B: ah still in high school who wants to gain certain experience in the workforce but as far as like trying to make a living and raise their kids on minimum wage i don't 

499.58 501.42 A: yeah 

504.74 505.85 A: no 

506.21 512.76 A: i don't think that would ever even work making five dollars an hour isn't enough to support anybody 

508.65 510.39 B: yeah so that's 

512.34 516.30 B: yeah and and people need to realise that until you know 

516.41 521.14 B: instead of complaining about how low the minimum wage is well the minimum wage 

519.34 522.08 A: yeah they should aim higher anyway 

521.98 522.80 B: (( yeah )) 

522.31 532.90 A: and not but that's what i was saying making seven down here is like okay it's not too bad but then 'cause ours is only five dollars so five fifteen 

527.51 528.80 B: mhm 

531.72 545.01 B: yes it's five i should they i would say they should definitely increase it because what do you have that's like forty dollars a day and after taxes barely thirty dollars you know if that 

539.18 541.09 A: yeah exactly 

542.66 557.18 A: and then and that's what it is and a lot of places that only pay minimum wage are like mcdonalds and taco bell and then you're really i mean who really wants to do that kind of work anyway and you only get paid five bucks an hour as a not be making too happy 

548.71 549.62 B: uh-huh 

554.57 555.58 B: yeah 

557.24 558.21 B: yeah 

559.08 560.00 A: i knew 

559.13 559.98 B: so 

560.29 562.94 B: [laughter] that's how i feel about minimum wage 

562.44 563.37 A: (( i know )) 

563.61 568.20 B: there they should there should be an increase yeah for sure if it's that low 

567.08 567.80 A: i 

567.97 569.63 A: i think it should too 

569.04 572.67 B: probably up to maybe seven fifty i think it's fair 

570.93 585.18 A: i think i think here it should just increase to six dollars an hour six dollars is enough for somebody they should not to live off of but you that's like you said you shouldn't be just trying to live off minimum wage anyway 

577.81 579.27 B: yeah 

584.95 586.23 B: mhm mhm 

585.37 590.03 A: 'cause six dollars an hour for somebody who's trying to live off minimum wage i think that's enough 

589.97 597.63 B: yeah six i would say maybe seven here seven fifty here and and yeah i mean 

594.53 595.75 A: yeah 

597.82 599.95 B: i think that would be a fair rate but we can
