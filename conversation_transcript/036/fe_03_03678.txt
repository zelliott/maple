3.60 4.86 B: hey carey 

5.69 8.85 A: [noise] so we're supposed to talk about the minimum wage increase [noise] 

8.32 10.78 B: [noise] yeah i guess so um 

11.14 12.57 B: you think it's enough 

12.87 16.15 A: yeah ah truth i wasn't even aware it had gone up [laughter] 

15.43 22.42 B: [laughter] i wasn't either i actually i thought it had already gone up to that a couple of years ago i guess not [mn] [noise] 

20.62 33.32 A: um yeah that's actually what i thought i'm like i didn't know maybe it's not recent maybe it's just an old one or whatever i don't think there's too many minimum wage jobs out there anymore truthfully [noise] [noise] i mean 

25.51 26.78 B: yeah 

27.03 27.88 B: (( i don't know )) 

31.47 32.91 B: really 

33.34 36.62 A: except probably for younger people [noise] 

36.09 42.59 B: oh i don't know um i live in a city and i see lots of minimum wage jobs posted everywhere 

42.24 43.54 A: oh really 

43.07 45.61 B: unfortunately yeah [mn] 

45.11 49.23 A: see where we live our unemployment rate is like two percent so 

48.49 50.36 B: (( exactly [noise] )) 

49.74 51.56 A: there's are a lot of people making 

51.63 53.42 A: they can make what they want 

53.52 54.28 A: [noise] 

54.16 55.19 B: yeah 

55.73 69.66 B: um i don't know i mean i i think as minimum wages go i i think it's too low i mean it's definitely below a living wage and i don't i don't know what that works out to be a year but i think it's like eight dollars an hour works out to be like 

62.26 64.13 A: (( [noise] yeah and they )) 

69.91 72.84 B: [noise] what sixteen thousand something like that 

72.52 75.09 A: which would be probably below [noise] the poverty level [noise] 

75.30 83.80 B: actually it's above surprisingly enough but i mean we know you can't live on it i make more than that and [laughter] i scarcely get along i don't know about you 

76.72 77.59 A: (( really )) 

83.88 89.22 A: oh actually i don't work anymore [laughter] i've been a a homemaker for the past year and a half 

85.55 86.98 B: (( oh good for you )) 

88.81 91.04 B: oh so you work harder than you did before 

90.66 95.56 A: i you know it's crazy 'cause my husband thinks i stay home all day and i don't [laughter] 

94.69 97.45 B: exactly [laughter] [noise] 

96.54 99.40 A: i almost wish i could go back to work just for a break 

99.33 104.38 B: yeah i hear that i do [mn] did you ever work a minimum wage job 

100.92 101.85 A: [laughter] 

104.54 109.76 A: um i mean other than as like in high school no i don't think i ever have 

109.32 111.16 B: (( [noise] mm and )) 

109.82 112.56 A: well i did waitressing for a few years 

112.38 114.53 B: that's even lower isn't it 

113.35 114.81 A: yeah 

114.55 116.29 B: yeah 

115.24 119.08 A: but by the time you get your tips and that you know it equals out so 

119.58 121.31 B: (( [noise] yeah yeah [noise] )) 

121.98 134.55 B: yeah that seems like such a better way to do it i'm surprised that they don't just change it to that actually lower the minimum wage even more [noise] and and just make it mandatory that you know tips are legal in all ser- in all services you know 

134.35 136.32 A: that would be a neat idea yeah 

135.72 138.68 B: yeah and then you could like tip at mcdonalds [mn] 

138.41 139.39 A: yeah 

138.83 140.37 B: [mn] right 

140.03 141.76 A: you'd probably make better money 

141.69 146.02 B: you would think yeah and then it would also be based on quality of service 

145.98 146.90 A: yeah 

146.27 147.55 B: right 

146.98 154.27 A: that's like um there's some car washes where you tip the people that wipe your cars at the end and they make really good money 

152.73 153.97 B: yeah 

154.01 156.57 B: [noise] yeah yeah 

155.61 158.62 A: you figure you know a dollar per car that goes through 

158.78 162.67 B: huh that's a lot in a day especially this time of year 

160.34 161.28 A: yeah 

161.31 162.01 A: and 

162.33 168.44 A: i think they're like minimum wage jobs but by the time you know they do fifty cars or whatever in a day they make good money 

168.24 169.76 B: exactly 

169.89 172.53 B: that would make it worth it [noise] [noise] 

172.72 178.23 A: [noise] but i guess um i really wouldn't know what i would say if minimum wage if that is acceptable or 

178.87 184.21 A: i'm not sure anybody could live on a minimum wage job at five fifteen so it would it would probably have to be higher or 

185.07 186.77 A: i don't know [laughter] 

186.12 187.34 B: yeah 

187.42 189.91 B: yeah if it was like five thirty five 

190.08 193.23 B: no i can't even imagine and especially if if you had kids 

193.20 194.18 A: yeah 

194.03 198.25 B: i [laughter] can't imagine what you'd do i mean you'd have to work several jobs i imagine 

198.70 203.75 A: yeah i couldn't imagine somebody like offering me that i don't know if i'd feel in- insulted 

204.40 206.93 B: (( [noise] yeah [laughter] )) 

205.94 208.94 A: for someone to tell you you know you get minimum wage 

207.71 213.14 B: i know if somebody offered me five dollars to do something for an hour i probably wouldn't do it you know 

212.76 213.73 A: right 

213.38 219.83 B: i mean they had to offer us what a dollar a minute to get us to do this [laughter] [mn] [laughter] 

216.96 220.67 A: i know [laughter] [laughter] how long have you been doing this 

220.91 223.11 B: um actually just about a month now

227.12 229.05 A: and that's it and then you're done with it 

228.97 234.83 B: i think so i think that's the way it works yeah i know a friend of mine was going to penn and that's where they're doing this study so 

234.61 235.57 A: (( yeah huh )) 

234.97 238.49 B: she asked me if i'd do it and i said hey why not you just talk on the phone

251.30 252.14 B: (( yeah )) 

252.16 255.77 A: you think sometimes you can talk nonstop and then other times it's 

255.46 256.55 B: [noise]

364.60 365.95 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

364.97 376.44 A: [mn] yeah it's true because it's it's like it's a forced environment almost trying to you know meet somebody i think it's a great way to meet people 'cause like being a home maker i don't talk to too many adults anymore so [laughter]

471.47 472.83 A: yeah 

474.01 477.51 A: oh it's really incredible i don't think i've ever met anybody in a field like that so

495.50 497.52 B: (( yeah )) 

496.04 499.68 A: and you joined the study as as a friend a friend had asked you 

499.88 507.56 B: yeah a friend asked me she was doing it and i guess she got a dollar extra or something if she got other people to do it so 

506.69 507.60 A: right 

507.69 509.89 B: i said sure why not 

510.13 512.34 B: it's ten minutes i can do that 

512.06 513.19 A: yeah 

512.80 514.37 B: yeah [laughter] 

514.10 517.35 A: it's kind of neat to to talk to people from everywhere and 

517.43 519.88 A: like you know just meet other people i guess 

520.09 522.84 B: [mn] exactly i'm kind of surprised they 

521.08 522.64 A: and get different views 

522.93 536.35 B: exactly i'm surprised they didn't set it up more that way instead of having us you know actually debate about something 'cause it never i don't know about you but i never wind up talking about what they want me to talk about [laughter] 

533.29 542.19 A: yeah [laughter] well the the same with like with minimum wage you you know you you say okay do i think it's good or not and then what else do you say you know [laughter] 

541.37 542.76 B: exactly 

542.76 544.01 A: leave it out there 

543.13 544.18 B: exactly 

544.22 545.73 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

546.02 547.00 B: yeah 

547.18 549.72 A: there's only so much you can say about it 

549.54 550.85 B: exactly 

550.52 556.14 A: i feel really out out of it i wasn't even aware i don't know if that was a recent that it had gone up to or 

556.32 562.25 B: i have no idea i'm i m- must be ah more out of touch than i thought too 'cause i had no idea that it had gone up at all 

562.74 568.41 B: but you know i mean we don't we don't hire anyone that we pay minimum wage at the school so 

568.15 569.20 A: (( mm right )) 

569.02 573.68 B: (( i wouldn't really know you know they're all above that but [mn] i don't know )) 

575.32 577.97 B: [mn] it seems like there wouldn't be any growth in it 

578.98 580.43 A: yeah 

579.81 580.92 B: you know 

581.06 590.36 B: i mean even in accounting right like you do well and you know you stay at your job and and you're loyal and you stay there and you move up or you move on 

590.37 596.87 B: and you know you keep moving up on your pay scale but i mean if you're starting at five [laughter] thirty five an hour 

597.15 599.63 B: i don't know what's the incentive 

599.15 599.89 A: (( yeah and i ))
