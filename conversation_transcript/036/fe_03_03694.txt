0.83 2.08 A: hello 

1.60 3.68 B: hello this is denise 

3.21 4.83 A: this is julie 

4.22 5.42 B: hi julie 

5.06 5.90 A: hi 

6.98 9.89 A: so have you done this before it's new for me 

9.33 11.40 B: not like this [laughter] 

10.20 12.20 A: [laughter] okay 

11.71 13.76 B: not like this i've done several 

15.17 19.56 B: kind of this sort of thing but it's always been on the computer never on the phone 

19.13 22.72 A: oh oh good well you have more experience than me 

21.98 24.26 B: [laughter] 

23.79 28.68 A: you know i was trying to think i don't think i know a single person that's on a minimum wage job 

29.11 31.85 A: mostly 'cause my friends are all adults and 

31.28 32.30 B: mhm 

32.25 34.11 A: i don't know where do you live 

34.11 35.55 B: central illinois 

35.46 41.26 A: oh so maybe it's livable there i don't know i live in manhattan there's no way to live here on minimum wage 

38.92 39.89 B: oh 

40.76 41.80 B: right 

41.97 43.10 B: right 

43.23 45.63 B: well even even here you know 

45.71 50.16 B: five dolla- you know wh- i don't even know what minimum wage is anymore i'm an r. n. so 

48.88 51.40 A: they said five fifteen i think 

50.88 54.40 B: that's what they want to increase it to but i don't even know what it is currently 

52.39 53.28 A: oh 

54.21 58.52 A: and i thought it was state by state i didn't realize it was the same across the country 

57.94 61.10 B: no i think it's federal mandated for the minimum 

60.22 61.80 A: (( oh uh-huh )) 

61.48 64.96 B: now states can make a higher minimum if they want i think 

66.13 70.20 A: [noise] oh so we're both pretty ignorant on the topic [laughter] 

68.75 72.92 B: yeah i mean even my you know i have an eighteen year old son who's going to college 

73.01 75.08 B: even when they started him out 

75.36 79.57 B: at ah at his base job it was six dollars an hour 

79.31 80.25 A: uh-huh 

79.72 85.59 B: so i kind of assumed that that's what minimum wage was it's been a long time since i've worked a minimum wage job [mn] [noise] 

85.16 86.96 A: yeah and um 

87.38 90.01 A: i don't know i always think either people are 

90.21 102.24 A: are working under the table and then you know it sort of varies or i don't know i just never knew anybody doing minimum wage the closest i've done is waitressing where it's really low wage but then they expect you to make tips 

100.01 101.01 B: mhm 

103.39 109.13 B: [mn] yeah yeah they make it i mean they cut it specifically because they anticipate the ti- tips 

103.60 104.16 A: (( [mn] )) 

108.74 109.70 A: uh-huh 

109.49 113.23 B: now we live in a rural area and the guys on the farm 

113.34 115.95 B: they only have to make two thirds minimum wage 

115.60 116.81 A: really 

116.36 118.06 B: yeah 

117.46 121.55 A: oh 'cause they live they get living accommodations or something 

120.62 127.54 B: well not necessarily i mean some of them are the high school kids or the college kids working on the farm and stuff but [mn] 

126.63 127.36 A: (( oh )) 

127.78 132.63 B: i guess because agriculture is considered a depressed economy type thing 

132.44 133.40 A: uh-huh 

132.86 136.66 B: they don't h- i know they don't have to pay a minimum wage so 

136.27 137.89 A: wow that's interesting 

138.29 143.00 B: [mn] so they pay 'em less than that now a lot of them go ahead and pay minimum or better 

142.56 143.49 A: uh-huh 

143.16 145.56 B: but i don't think they're required to 

145.77 149.14 A: oh i took a course one time where they talked about 

149.03 151.72 A: um i- it was actually a course on 

151.60 164.77 A: how to interview for jobs and one of the things they asked is what is minimum wage and the teacher's definition is that minimum that everybody gets minimum wage 'cause you get the minimum that they think that they can get away with [laughter] paying you for the job that you're doing 

153.33 154.15 B: uh-huh 

163.81 166.52 B: (( [laughter] well )) 

166.22 169.60 A: [laughter] yes i think there's some truth to it i mean 

169.48 170.49 B: right 

171.03 178.09 A: most people earn even if they're paying a high rate it's because they figure they have to to be competitive if they could pay less 

176.14 177.02 B: true 

177.46 181.19 B: right 'cause i'm an r. n. and believe me with the nursing shortage 

181.77 184.01 B: but they've had to up our wages 

184.09 187.30 B: in order to keep competitive and keep keep nurses 

186.95 187.92 A: uh-huh 

187.91 189.35 B: but [noise] 

189.93 194.21 B: i know when i worked at a nursing home a lot of our nursing assistants made minimum wage 

194.67 201.53 A: yeah it's amazing h- i you know i've never been able to understand how they determine what jobs are have what value anyway 

201.21 202.14 B: yeah 

202.17 203.08 A: um 

203.79 210.55 A: you know it's a thing like teachers that make so little with such an important job and nurses who are you know i mean 

207.91 208.77 B: mhm 

210.70 224.27 A: my i've had very fortunately very limited experience with hospital settings but i did have a really bad family emergency about two years ago and what i remember is that to me the nurses were 

224.45 236.40 A: you know they were the god send they were the ones that seemed like they should have really been the ones paid the most 'cause the doctors were hardly ever around it was the nurses that really did all the caring for my brother so 

235.50 236.53 B: right 

236.65 239.83 B: well they do that bed side day hand to hand stuff 

239.43 240.53 A: yeah 

239.96 242.84 B: unfortunately they can't do anything without a doctor telling them 

242.80 243.75 A: uh-huh 

243.41 245.40 B: what to do [laughter] 

244.44 252.99 A: which is pretty scary 'cause i remember when i was in school i dated a med student and i was majoring in advertising and his homework was so much easier than mine 

252.93 254.51 B: [laughter] 

254.31 265.15 A: it was you don't really have to be able to do anything except memorize to get through med school it's not a very conceptual thing you know it's just a lot of reading and memorizing from what i could see of his homework 

261.72 262.53 B: (( mm )) 

265.51 268.81 B: yeah but then when you actually start doing it you have to put it all together 

268.55 269.84 A: mhm 

269.27 271.66 B: okay so this is this symptom 

272.63 274.91 A: yeah 

273.93 281.62 B: but what can it be it can be fifteen different things and you have to sort out exactly what it is and then once you sort it out what's the best treatment 

281.86 286.67 B: well the best treatment might be this but gee this patient's also got this and this and this going on 

282.03 282.78 A: uh-huh 

287.05 293.67 B: and this wouldn't be a good thing so they're got to sort it all out and i wouldn't want their job [laughter] 

291.09 292.27 A: meanwhile 

292.59 294.43 A: yeah i wouldn't either 

293.84 294.42 B: (( [mn] )) 

295.24 302.00 B: although there's a lot of times the new doctors coming through as an old nurse i tell them what i want ordered [laughter] and they do it [laughter] 

300.25 302.34 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

305.14 306.35 B: (( [cough] [noise] )) 

307.97 316.12 A: yeah but i i guess minimum wage i mean beyond mcdonalds i don't really know where they and like you say the farm things um 

314.94 319.33 B: right i think a lot of the retail probably is minimum 

319.43 321.31 B: like cashier type stuff 

319.83 320.53 A: oh 

321.74 325.83 A: i guess maybe cashier i don't know here a lot of retail is um 

326.24 328.54 A: the really good stores are all union 

328.46 329.57 B: oh 

329.15 343.39 A: which is amazing because you meet these people that really don't have a lot of capability for anything but they get into these union jobs in retail and basically stand around all day and make really good money doing it um 

330.67 331.23 B: (( [mn] )) 

341.82 342.71 B: uh-huh 

344.01 351.97 A: but ah it was a real enlightening thing when i first found out [laughter] about that 'cause i was i worked retail minimum wage when i was in high school 

351.92 352.90 B: mhm 

352.13 356.15 A: and i just assumed they were all like that but i think new york is a little different story 

357.05 358.45 B: yeah probably 

359.24 359.96 A: (( [mn] )) 

359.25 364.64 B: a lot differ- i mean i think both of the coasts are a lot different than the middle part of the united states 

364.22 367.26 A: mhm yeah i'm originally from wisconsin so 

366.72 367.76 B: (( oh okay )) 

368.31 370.45 B: yeah so you [laughter] 

369.86 372.16 A: yeah i've been there [laughter] 

371.54 375.77 B: yeah well i have a nephew in rochester new york so 

375.23 376.90 A: yeah 

375.84 381.57 B: i know a little bit about what goes on out that direction and i had an aunt who lived in [noise] plattsburg and stuff so 

381.35 388.37 A: well the funny thing about rochester is that the people there sound so much like they're from wisconsin 

388.43 389.52 B: [laughter] 

388.57 391.48 A: upstate new york is almost the exact same exact 

391.51 394.47 A: i mean i get them confused and i'm from wisconsin 

394.39 395.47 B: [laughter] 

396.43 400.65 B: well my nephew's deaf he couldn't tell me what their accent sounds like [laughter] 

398.72 400.09 A: [laughter] 

400.46 402.61 A: well and um 

402.69 410.84 A: ah my theory was always that it comes from the cold that your c- you get cold and your vocal chords tight up tighten up and that's what creates the accent 

410.41 411.57 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

410.94 415.09 A: 'cause every time i go back to wisconsin i co- it all comes back [laughter] 

414.04 415.28 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [laughter] )) 

417.88 421.19 B: [sigh] are they going to tell us when our time's up i can't remember what 

420.26 425.70 A: i would think so i mean i it sounded at least the robot thing sounded like it [laughter] knew what it was doing 

421.44 422.25 B: (( okay )) 

425.43 428.86 B: i hope so i like i said i've not done this before either so 

426.21 427.07 A: [laughter] 

428.50 431.02 A: how did you find out about it 

430.45 433.13 B: [noise] um somebody sent me an email 

432.85 433.69 A: (( oh )) 

433.87 435.48 B: how did you find out about it 

435.22 436.84 A: on craig's list 

437.25 439.26 A: do you ever look at craig's list 

438.66 440.30 B: i don't know what that is uh-uh 

439.85 445.64 A: it's a it's a website it's very interesting it they break it down by cities 

445.68 454.93 A: and it's got all these categories like classified ads but it's totally free to place ads and it constant- and it's updated every ten minutes or so 

451.64 452.23 B: (( hm )) 

454.64 455.52 B: uh-huh 

455.40 459.06 A: and i love to go on it 'cause i love to do things like focus groups 

459.05 460.06 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

460.11 464.15 A: and and yeah it's just for a change or something it's kind of fun 

464.35 466.12 B: (( right huh )) 

466.34 467.72 B: i don't know where this 

468.09 472.48 B: friend of mine saw that ad but she just sent it she goes this sounds like something you'd be interested in 

472.61 475.33 A: meanwhile did you get this thing in um ah 

475.46 478.37 A: email that says they need more men [laughter] 

477.90 478.90 B: (( [noise] ah )) 

478.89 489.84 A: [laughter] i got something back from them that said that if i ah suggested to any men i get paid per man that i suggest [laughter] so apparently talking is a female thing [laughter] 

479.49 480.47 B: (( hm [noise] )) 

489.14 490.75 B: i would assume so 

491.65 494.29 B: either that or the internet's a female thing 

494.70 500.23 A: yeah i think probably more talking it seems like mo- most of the people i know that do a lot of net stuff are guys 

500.60 501.80 B: (( [laughter] )) 

501.13 501.90 A: so 

501.86 504.29 B: most of mine are net buddies are women so 

503.96 510.98 A: yeah i just i don't really spend a lot of time on it it's sort of a a new thing for me 

511.46 519.02 A: ah for the longest time i was very resistant to it i just couldn't for one thing it takes up so much time and i kept thinking 

514.37 515.24 B: mhm 

519.08 523.59 A: computers alone suck up so much time how could i possibly have time for the internet 

523.38 524.36 B: right 

524.04 528.98 A: and sure enough i've lost whole evenings to it that i wish i hadn't gone on [laughter] 

527.60 528.67 B: right 

529.00 530.94 B: oh yeah 

531.49 534.73 B: oh yeah but i come from a family of computer nerds so 

534.50 539.47 A: oh you're lucky then you don't have to worry about if things break down you have people that actually understand 'em 

539.23 544.53 B: yeah my mom's a programmer my brother's a my mom teaches programming my brother's a programmer 

544.13 545.38 A: oh wow 

544.68 550.42 B: my nephew that lives in new york he's a computer graphics artist for the united states government and [mn] 

550.94 553.02 B: i'm the oddball i'm a nurse 

552.29 554.30 A: [laughter] 

553.48 554.16 B: [laughter] 

555.96 558.34 B: but none of us work minimum wage jobs [laughter] 

557.87 560.93 A: [noise] yeah oh especially in computers 

560.91 567.81 A: i had a friend that was a typist a five dollar an hour typist i guess that was minimum wage may- or a little more than that 

567.19 568.10 B: uh-huh 

567.78 578.62 A: years ago and because she was a good typist when her company got a computer she was the one they trained on it and she had a real knack for it and here it is now i don't know 

574.15 574.90 B: (( ah )) 

576.04 576.94 B: uh-huh 

578.59 591.00 A: fifteen twenty years later and she's a six figure person over at morgan stanley running the you know [laughter] the i._t. department and ah all because you know she was a good typist and got on at the right time 

585.27 586.62 B: yeah 

591.41 595.36 B: i think that's why my mom ended up doing it she went in teaching business 

595.97 599.95 B: and when she was going through it she had worked in a library and learned how
