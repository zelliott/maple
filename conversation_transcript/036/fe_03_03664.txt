13.22 14.46 A: [laughter] 

14.83 16.05 A: (( oh )) 

16.07 19.59 B: so what do you think about the minimum wage or whatever [laughter] 

18.36 21.12 A: i don't see how anybody could live on it 

20.89 27.26 B: well i don't i i uh it isn't five fifteen an hour here it's uh six seventy five 

27.23 29.72 A: i guess they mean the federal minimum wage 

29.76 33.13 B: i guess so yeah i i thought it was the same everywhere 

32.33 35.26 A: yeah well i'm i i guess california probably 

35.30 42.01 A: a- appl- applied local la- laws that make 'em pay more or maybe or maybe there's 

38.91 39.61 B: (( y- )) 

39.77 41.02 B: (( yeah )) 

42.13 44.22 A: i wonder if there's a 

44.65 48.42 A: like differentiations based on where you are i mean 

48.64 53.15 A: five fifteen in richmond is probably a lot more livable than five fifteen in 

53.18 54.68 A: in new york city 

54.56 58.99 B: yeah that's true yeah i was talking to a girl earlier today th- this is my second call 

57.31 58.10 A: yeah 

58.95 59.74 A: oh 

59.26 71.24 B: uh yeah on the on the same topic and i guess we're making five fifteen there now i don't know how the hell you can do that yeah the the a small apartment there apparently is uh like eight hundred dollars a month 

70.65 78.94 A: yeah yeah i mean sh- i mean even here richmond is is not terribly expensive place to live but 

71.75 72.60 B: yeah 

78.83 79.71 B: yeah 

79.38 86.74 A: two hundred dollars a week eight hundred dollars a month you figure after taxes uh i don't know what that is five six hundred bucks a month 

86.46 87.36 B: yeah 

86.76 90.98 A: then by the time you pay even here i guess you're get- i mean 

91.33 98.20 A: i can't imagine what you'd live in for two or three hundred dollars a month and have another hundred or two hundred for everything else 

98.17 99.43 B: yeah really 

98.85 100.71 A: seems mighty rough to me 

100.76 108.99 B: well you know i was making six fifty five for quite a while and then seven dollars an hour for a while and i just quit my job not that long ago but 

108.26 109.39 A: mhm 

109.17 115.73 B: it conflicts but yeah i got uh a place here that my mom lets me have for a hundred dollars a month when i'm working 

114.50 120.97 A: so you so you gotta break on your rent i mean gosh like if you had to pay full rent there what would you what would you do 

116.88 117.69 B: yeah 

120.97 123.87 B: uh i'd be in trouble [laughter] i reck- 

122.08 126.25 A: yeah you'd be working two jobs probably you'd be working eighty hours a week 

124.28 125.35 B: (( i know i'd be )) 

125.94 128.98 B: i'm now unemployed and just going to school at night a little bit 

129.24 130.42 A: (( mm )) 

129.36 136.91 B: learn learn how to do computers so but i'll get a little more money but yeah i i don't know how they make it yeah it 

135.83 139.24 A: i mean i i just don't know you know what to loo- 

139.68 145.21 A: i i i i mean i don't know i i i just yeah i agree i don't know how people can make it 

144.84 150.50 B: yeah of course you know there's some people that think that there shouldn't be a minimum wage because um 

150.91 151.84 B: it 

153.01 160.34 B: you know uh it it causes people to get paid that when maybe they should get paid less or maybe they should get paid more 

160.03 166.15 A: yeah what job what job should their be that should pay less than that an hour 

166.20 167.90 B: (( well )) 

168.56 171.84 B: what i'm thinking is is like you know um [sigh] 

172.61 178.56 B: i had a job where i was uh a delivery driver and and i was uh 

175.70 176.58 A: uh-huh 

178.43 190.92 B: uh wasn't a full schedule like a lot of the other people that worked there and uh i had uh some physical problems that make it so that i wasn't as good in house and i was more of a driver than some of the other drivers 

190.32 191.21 A: uh-huh 

191.14 203.09 B: and yet because of the minimum wage you know and our minimum wage is six seventy five i had to p- get paid at least that even though other people were getting paid the same amount and working themselves half to death 

203.64 207.87 B: you know and the business can't afford to pay less now i'm not saying that that i 

208.09 212.46 B: would have wanted to be paid less but maybe i deserved to be paid a little less 

212.30 216.07 A: yeah but you know i thought that was i mean i remember 

216.15 220.30 A: i mean it's common around here that waitresses and stuff earn 

220.36 223.40 A: less than minimum wage 'cause they're getting tips 

223.21 226.77 B: yeah i don't i don't i don't believe in that 

223.79 224.88 A: you know s- 

226.20 227.34 A: yeah 

226.84 232.98 B: i mean if it's the minimum wage it seems to me tips are something that you get above and beyond for doing more 

232.56 237.05 A: oh i know but i mean everybody expects to get paid tips and stuff you know 

236.48 245.94 B: yeah but then when they do it that way then you go in there and what if you can't afford to pay you know the more than than what the menu says that the meal costs 

237.19 238.96 A: (( um )) 

245.36 253.43 A: right and what if you're what if you're a really crummy waiter and don't get any tips you know she should probably change jobs then but 

248.95 249.72 B: yeah 

250.10 251.93 B: yeah really yeah 

252.83 259.82 B: and then you know and and not the best waiter or not the prettiest person or something like that they still need t- they still need to put food on the table 

256.46 257.85 A: right right 

259.16 265.19 A: right and the fact is your the employer is counting on that tip to make up some of his wage structure 

260.17 261.03 B: so 

265.17 268.03 B: yeah it it it's weird i don't understand 

265.20 266.52 A: (( you know but )) 

266.70 274.87 A: it's a little little bogus too but i don't know most of the most of see most the waiters and waitresses i know seem pretty happy with uh 

275.08 275.97 A: uh 

276.37 278.13 A: (( making tips you know )) 

277.60 280.91 B: yeah well we can probably [laughter] hide some of it too 

280.14 283.17 A: yeah yeah yeah i'm sure they do i'm sure they do 

281.04 281.82 B: [laughter] 

282.21 283.06 B: yeah 

283.33 285.48 B: yeah i never got a tip 

283.88 285.55 A: uh is that a cash 

285.50 286.79 B: [laughter] 

285.89 297.19 A: uh i don't know um a friend of mine where i worked uh used to deliver pizzas and he said he made he was making like twelve fifteen dollars an hour pretty pretty steady there 

297.17 298.03 B: huh 

297.26 301.85 A: from you know just not from delivering pizzas but from the tips you'd get 

301.20 303.73 B: yeah i was thinking of looking into that actually 

303.54 312.96 A: you should probably try it i mean it seemed to me i mean that's one of the things i think you know i i would do if i was if if if i if i lost my job you know 

305.93 306.72 B: yeah 

312.68 315.66 B: it's more of an evening job though isn't it or afternoon evening 

315.20 325.57 A: yeah i would imagine i imagine you you know it's probably from five to midnight or so or five to one whatever you know or friday work and friday and saturday work yeah 

323.07 323.92 B: (( yeah )) 

324.64 334.24 B: really my li- my li- might look into it from a for when i'm at school next semester 'cause then i'll be able to you know skittle my classes for daytime and go to do that in the evenings 

333.81 340.18 A: mhm mhm i think blo- i think the big downside of it is getting ripped off occasionally 

334.85 336.53 B: yeah that'd be cool 

340.20 341.64 A: (( but you know )) 

340.72 343.56 B: yes well i'm i'm a a 

344.01 347.00 B: about three hundred pounds six one 

347.17 351.07 B: uh [laughter] i might not [laughter] 

348.37 352.38 A: people you you you won't be threatened by people 

352.20 357.38 B: i probably won't yeah i won't be as likely to get ripped off as the little skinny pimple faced guy 

356.57 361.29 A: yeah yeah hm 

357.59 370.29 B: you know maybe i dunno and if say if th- if i do a [laughter] they'd probably be real surprised that as i hand them the money and say [laughter] and there's a pizza can i put something on that for you [laughter] i dunno 

368.07 369.62 A: [laughter] 

370.00 376.64 A: yeah yeah so how many how many of these calls have you got from the university of pennsylvania you say this is your second one today

535.64 540.42 A: oh maybe they changed it when i fir- when i looked at it it seemed like i would have to refer like

544.26 554.27 B: [laughter] that wouldn't be worth that wouldn't be worth the trouble i got like one other guy that i'm maybe gonna send uh the link to but not because of the dollar just 'cause i think he'd be interested in it
