19.84 22.36 A: so i'm just warning you [laughter] 

21.14 22.77 B: [laughter] that's cool 

23.32 26.85 A: (( um are i guess we're supposed to talk for ten minutes )) 

26.23 27.94 B: yeah [laughter] 

27.44 28.26 A: [laughter] 

29.00 33.74 B: um um i don't know a whole lot about the minimum wage bes- you know i'm i'm assuming that 

29.21 30.31 A: about 

33.98 34.77 B: that's 

34.80 37.12 B: fairly little money [laughter] 

37.27 39.16 B: for anyone um 

39.56 43.48 B: and i don't really know how they base like their increases you know 

39.66 40.70 A: yeah 

44.32 45.39 A: well 

45.78 52.37 A: considering that five fifteen at least in the philadelphia area is not that much 

52.03 53.00 B: yeah 

52.61 57.25 A: um i don't even think it's enough to live off of unless you're like 

57.43 67.22 A: living in your home with like your parents and you don't have any bills at all because [mn] that's like less than twenty thousand dollars a year 

60.77 61.67 B: right 

67.04 69.08 B: yeah a lot less yeah 

68.48 72.10 A: so you know considering how much you would pay for rent 

72.12 79.12 A: how much you would need for food if you have any kids what you know it costs to raise a kid today 

79.00 80.58 B: yeah definitely 

80.76 82.22 B: i mean like yeah 

80.85 84.43 A: like i i don't think it's anywhere enough unless you're like 

84.91 88.41 A: you know a teenager who's just working part time [noise] 

88.22 90.35 B: yeah totally and i mean 

90.41 92.75 B: just the thought of you know 

92.78 95.80 B: even really inexpensive items like that you know 

95.81 97.16 B: it would cost 

97.48 103.44 B: you know basically you know four hours of your work to buy you know something that's 

103.62 105.59 B: pretty minimal you know like 

105.00 107.62 A: right and that's before taxes actually 

106.98 108.77 B: (( [laughter] yeah totally )) 

108.43 112.25 A: [laughter] after taxes are making like three dollars [laughter] an hour 

110.99 112.91 B: exactly [laughter] yeah 

112.77 116.69 A: so i mean it's like slave wages i don't 

115.85 117.72 B: definitely yeah 

117.93 123.30 A: i don't i don't think i don't know how people could possibly live off of that if 

123.83 125.20 A: they had to 

123.90 124.98 B: yeah 

125.24 133.92 A: and people do and i guess that's why people are sometimes who are working minimum wage who have minimum wage jobs are working like two three four jobs because 

133.42 134.73 B: yeah definitely 

134.73 137.36 A: there's not enough to live off of and then you 

137.42 139.62 A: god you kinda work yourself to death 

139.57 153.60 B: yeah definitely and i mean what kind of quality of life would your kids or your family have if you know you're working all these jobs and it just affects it's it has a trick- trickle down effect of you know the damage it does to people and communities of 

153.58 154.77 A: right 

154.01 154.82 B: (( you know )) 

154.84 156.92 B: you can't contribute anything to 

155.08 155.98 A: right 

157.38 160.34 B: (( you know your [laughter] spirit anymore basically yeah )) 

160.47 171.11 A: right i mean yeah it it it goes into all your aspects of life because your kids don't see you and then you know they kind of that parental care and 

160.51 161.07 B: (( yeah )) 

171.26 177.91 A: you know you're working all the time so you're probably depressed probably not eating like you should 

178.13 179.26 B: right 

178.21 185.08 A: not getting enough rest and sleep so even if you did have some time you're probably not taking care of what you need to 'cause you're unable to 

184.91 186.48 B: (( yeah definitely )) 

186.32 190.77 A: um and still at the end of the day you don't [laughter] have enough money 

190.21 191.45 B: right 

191.26 192.39 A: um 

192.19 194.93 B: yeah and it's weird how sometimes when i see the 

195.03 199.48 B: figures of like um what the poverty line is it's like 

200.00 203.95 B: e- even so much higher than the poverty line is is really 

204.46 206.55 B: you know it's hard to imagine that 

206.99 211.56 B: people you know 'cause i can't remember what the poverty line is it's like it's incredibly low it's you know it's like 

211.59 215.27 B: nine thousand dollars for a single person or something and it's like [mn] 

215.37 219.85 B: how could anyone on you know eve- even someone making twice that is is having a lot of trouble 

220.16 223.27 B: certainly going to the doctor or paying bills it's like 

222.90 229.99 A: [noise] right that's right i [laughter] yeah i didn't even think about medical care which is [noise] a whole other ball of wax 'cause i know 

223.47 224.25 B: (( you know )) 

226.29 227.62 B: mhm 

229.15 229.93 B: yeah 

230.19 232.68 A: kids can get medical care for free 

232.20 233.69 B: yeah uh-huh 

233.10 234.93 A: but adults can't 

234.31 235.43 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

235.56 240.04 A: and i'm sure it's a problem if your parents are sick [laughter] and 

238.77 240.52 B: yeah totally 

240.18 248.63 A: you know they can't afford to go to the doctor or even the kids they can go to the doctor it doesn't mean they can get the medication they need or 

248.88 254.38 A: you know if they need to see a specialist it only covers like minimal 

251.29 252.12 B: yeah 

254.84 256.77 A: the very minimum so 

256.62 257.64 B: yeah 

256.86 267.30 A: you know anything above and beyond that pretty much you're not getting it the kid ends up going to the hospital for like an emergency [mn] i don't even know how that's handled 

264.85 266.09 B: yeah 

267.69 268.72 A: so 

268.58 269.74 B: (( definitely )) 

269.56 273.23 A: (( i guess the minimum wage is bad [laughter] it's )) 

271.19 274.13 B: (( [laughter] totally )) 

273.53 275.92 A: a bad thing [laughter] 

274.88 289.44 B: [laughter] i mean at least there is a minimum wage but i mean i- i've heard rumors i mean i live in brooklyn and i've i've heard rumors that you've you know how many sweat shops exist in you know manhattan and and brooklyn and it's you know there are people 

289.62 298.16 B: even you know and this and people talk about sweat shops overseas there are even ones right here in the city that you know there are people who are immigrants and who can't get 

293.24 294.19 A: mhm 

298.05 311.32 B: legal jobs or you know who are illegal and um they are working for even less than min- minimum wage and they don't you know they don't follow code they were working eighty hours a week and you know seven days a ni- you know seven days a week and 

306.25 307.28 A: right 

311.09 312.31 A: right 

311.66 317.61 B: it's so it's pretty it's pretty wild what kind of situations there are so many people here and everywhere 

317.51 320.99 A: see i'm in philadelphia so i didn't even know [laughter] you were in brooklyn 

318.73 319.63 B: uh-huh 

320.56 321.69 B: [laughter] 

321.06 322.12 A: um 

322.53 325.12 A: but yeah the oh god 

325.51 333.34 A: if there are so many people who work under the table just because of the way the taxes every little cent they can 

328.63 329.73 B: mhm 

333.42 336.51 A: you know it's it's ridiculous 

335.88 337.22 B: yeah 

336.83 337.81 A: it i 

338.13 342.78 A: [sigh] i guess what it comes down to for me is that 

343.19 346.73 A: they have this thing they call the living wage 

346.43 347.72 B: right 

347.14 352.90 A: which is you know your salary should based on the cost of living where you live 

352.29 353.31 B: mhm 

353.12 358.91 A: [mn] and i think that's much more effective than a minimum wage because if you know 

358.02 359.84 B: yeah true yeah 

359.23 368.87 A: to live in like brooklyn is really expensive and you know you need x amount on average then that's what you should be making 

362.30 363.68 B: mhm 

368.59 370.10 B: right totally 

369.39 373.12 A: period i mean i know it gets into 

373.52 378.91 A: you know how much school you've had how much experience you've had you know how much training 

379.04 388.75 A: but you know [laughter] people have to live point blank and so many crimes are committed just because people don't have enough 

381.64 382.80 B: yeah 

388.63 390.14 B: yeah definitely 

388.77 389.83 A: you know 

390.40 396.06 A: people are stealing because they need to eat people are stealing because they need to you know feed their families 

395.98 397.65 B: yeah that's very true 

397.48 407.30 A: not saying that all crime [laughter] would be avoided if people were paid more definitely not because there are sociopaths out there and you can't avoid that [laughter] but 

404.62 405.53 B: (( [laughter] )) 

406.68 420.84 B: yeah but it's a good point i mean i just read recently that the bank robberies in new york have gone up three hundred percent in the last year and you know we're in the worst economic slump and the lowest you know th- the highest unemployment rate we've had in many many many years so it's like 

420.06 421.35 A: mhm 

420.79 428.39 B: not surprising that there are people who are really taking drastic measures to try and you know get get the cash 

426.65 427.99 A: right 

428.68 435.90 A: right unemployment will do that it will definitely increase the crime rate because people don't have [laughter] anything and 

432.19 433.22 B: yeah 

435.13 436.14 B: (( totally )) 

436.10 447.56 A: you know if the choice is either you're on the street tomorrow or you go rob someone and get the money and you could live in this house for like another day another week another month [laughter] 

447.21 448.92 B: right yeah 

448.75 452.23 A: most people are going to choose to rob someone i mean 

451.42 453.69 B: (( definitely yeah )) 

453.13 459.03 A: especially if you have kids involved if you're a wife or husband and you have a family you know 

459.03 460.32 B: yeah it's hard to 

459.43 462.08 A: most people just do what you got to do [laughter] 

461.39 468.90 B: totally i mean it's like it's it's easy sometimes when people who are in a theoretical place to say oh i would never steal or whatever but it's like well you know 

469.12 472.60 B: if if you you know have a sick child and you know that you know 

472.70 479.27 B: you know etcetera your you'll be evicted and you know it's it's hard it's just you know a lot of 

475.66 476.82 A: right 

479.33 481.83 B: things are going to be [noise] sort of 

479.40 480.40 A: (( [noise] [mn] it )) 

481.17 483.62 A: gets shady it gets difficult 

482.13 483.28 B: yeah 

483.46 484.55 B: definitely 

484.62 488.98 A: of course yeah it's so easy to say when you do [laughter] have the money oh i wouldn't do it 

487.55 489.26 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

489.04 494.71 A: i would never do that sort of thing you know but if you're put in a situation and you have to do something 

490.99 491.91 B: (( right )) 

495.35 501.39 A: you know it's it's hard it's hard to say i'm not going to just take the money in front of me 

497.83 499.06 B: yeah definitely 

500.89 504.09 B: mhm i mean i actually have been like 

502.35 503.14 A: (( [mn] )) 

504.23 507.05 B: somewhat unemployed in the last couple of years and i've definitely 

507.64 514.73 B: [mn] not thought about [laughter] crime necessarily but i've certainly thought about you know a lot of jobs and i've talked to people about 

509.84 510.94 A: [laughter] 

514.70 523.06 B: who've been in my situation who've become you know strippers and whatever and i mean you know everyone you know everything sorta gets thrown out the window when you're really desperate and 

518.49 519.70 A: oh yeah 

522.96 524.27 A: oh yeah 

523.20 527.72 B: i i've definitely you know thought about all sorts of things like that and 

527.04 533.43 A: oh yeah i mean it's it's hard you know i just so many things would be different if [sigh] 

533.40 544.20 A: you know people just made more money i'm sure that it has more effects than i'm thinking of or are aware of 'cause i'm sure it would completely [laughter] change the economy 

544.29 548.50 A: and you know things would just go spiralling out of control but 

548.53 557.73 B: yeah but at the same time it's like you know there's so many there's there's such a disparity now between the exorbitantly rich and the you know the poverty so it's i feel like 

548.61 549.68 A: 'cause of like 

555.44 556.22 A: yeah 

557.84 563.38 B: it it wouldn't break us all if if we would kind of come towards the middle a little more and 

562.78 565.66 A: but the money still has to come from somewhere um 

565.22 566.20 B: right 

565.82 569.39 A: because say you work at mcdonalds and you're making minimum wage 

569.45 582.93 A: and all of a sudden mcdonalds was forced to give everyone i don't know ten dollars an hour instead of five just so they can have enough money to live off of they have to get the money from somewhere i'm not saying that they don't have it 

575.81 576.95 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

580.63 581.67 B: right 

582.15 585.02 B: mhm definitely yeah it definitely changes 

582.99 584.12 A: but 

584.41 589.35 A: in the case of every company they're not going to have it because minimum wage is what they can afford 

589.29 590.65 B: mhm 

589.76 594.53 A: so then you have to wonder who's going to go out of business you know what 

594.71 599.89 A: products are going to have you know higher prices because they have to pay their
