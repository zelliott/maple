1.03 5.62 B: [noise] hi this is pat ellis in waynesville north carolina 

1.33 2.13 A: (( [noise] )) 

5.62 9.18 A: oh okay yeah this is chippy from dallas 

8.59 10.07 B: (( oh really [laughter] )) 

9.62 11.01 A: yes [laughter] 

10.11 12.71 B: okay we're talking about minimum wage [noise] 

12.23 13.75 A: yes 

12.81 17.85 B: okay and what how do you feel about that are you in a in a position 

17.99 21.12 B: where you would where that would be affect you 

21.01 31.06 A: well actually i'm not working right now but i think that like whatever wage you're getting i just i think it just depends on like you know what you need like is it for college or 

30.90 37.68 A: is it just for your own um you know your own needs like clo- like you know clothes or 

30.91 31.76 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

36.76 38.44 B: mhm mhm 

37.77 41.29 A: accessories it just depends on the situation you're in so 

40.92 44.14 B: i think too it depends on what type of job you're in 

43.89 45.34 A: (( yeah )) 

44.16 50.56 B: ah the service industry i think is more affected by this than the regular business community 

50.06 51.14 A: mhm 

50.50 60.60 B: and i've m- myself i have never worked in in a service industry but i'm sure i i mean i see so many of the like in the restaurants 

55.11 56.17 A: mhm 

60.76 62.97 B: the waiters and the waitresses and 

63.08 69.49 B: their per hour pay really is not very high i don't think i could ever live on that 

65.19 66.62 A: mhm 

68.44 77.68 A: yeah it's not very sufficient either and on top of that some like restaurants they actually only live off of tips rather than the hour and that's just yeah 

69.82 70.78 B: no 

74.88 75.70 B: (( yeah mm )) 

76.71 85.40 B: right i think that the salary itself is very low because the restaurant or whatever ah other organisation 

85.18 86.34 A: yeah 

85.39 98.04 B: realizes that that the most money they're going to get is is from tips but that's so you know if if you have bad weather and people aren't coming in and i- there's nothing there that you can really count on you know i- 

89.73 91.12 A: yeah 

94.38 96.02 A: mhm 

97.17 98.55 A: yeah 

98.19 100.83 B: [noise] um if you get a big party ah 

100.94 108.89 B: i suppose i think most waitresses feel that the men tip better than the women so they always tend to you know 

108.65 110.85 A: yeah that is true yeah 

108.93 111.48 B: bu- butter them up a little bit more 

110.98 119.11 A: yes yeah and also i think you know even though you know some people might get low paying it just depends on you know what the qu- 

111.71 112.55 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

118.92 132.39 A: you know what are the qualifications you need you know i mean if you barely need any qualifications then you know that means they're going to get a low pay but if it requires a lot of quali- quali- qualifications then of course you're going to get a high salary 

120.20 121.15 B: (( right right )) 

126.23 127.31 B: mhm 

128.71 129.38 B: (( right )) 

131.64 145.71 B: right well the turnover i'm sure you've noticed too you can go to the same restaurant three or four times and all of the sudden they're all new faces so i i wouldn't want to own a restaurant or a service industry because 

132.45 133.61 A: yeah 

137.04 138.62 A: mhm 

145.88 149.89 B: it keeping the employees is hard to do and 

149.03 150.52 A: yeah exactly 

149.93 160.35 B: they are they're going to pick up and go wherever the the pay is higher and i would assume that um i don't know i know they're trying to raise it to five fifteen 

153.77 155.12 A: yeah 

159.94 163.95 A: five fiftee- i thought they raised it up to like five seventy five or something 

163.09 169.50 B: oh real- well [noise] um when i initiated the call the person that was on the line said that ah 

169.58 174.19 B: how did how did we feel about five dollars and fifteen cents as the minimum wage 

172.64 175.35 A: oh okay the oh yeah 

174.24 181.38 B: so i mean that is really if you put in an eight hour day that's [laughter] forty dollars for the day 

178.58 180.16 A: yeah 

180.84 184.50 A: exactly that's just worth what half of your gas money right there 

183.78 189.76 B: well absolutely with the with the [laughter] with the rising gas prices you know 

185.03 187.14 A: yeah [laughter] 

188.34 190.35 A: yeah exactly 

189.71 204.22 B: ah and then when ah when the gas prices go up the taxes go up and you know if i if i had a family i couldn't support my family on that on that just the minimum wage alone 

195.47 196.86 A: yeah 

198.58 199.44 A: uh-huh 

200.69 202.31 A: yeah 

203.66 205.90 A: exactly i know 

204.49 206.58 B: so and i i live in a 

207.07 217.13 B: in a mountain community and ah it's in the winter there just aren't we depend on the tourist trade and there just aren't that many people coming in 

208.84 210.20 A: (( oh yeah )) 

211.18 212.24 A: mhm 

214.25 215.87 A: mhm 

216.77 218.10 A: mhm 

217.24 218.23 B: so 

218.24 231.65 B: like the motels and that close down for that season or the restaurants they let people go because if they are not having ah the volume of business then they can't afford to pay um their employees so 

223.00 224.30 A: yeah 

229.73 230.85 A: yeah 

231.60 245.98 B: i i don't think that um i really don't think five dollars and fifteen cents is high enough but on the other hand most of these people i think they're single or college students and yeah or 

237.52 238.82 A: yeah 

243.52 251.25 A: college students yeah exactly yeah my sister right now she's a college student and she's working she's a receptionist for a fitness centre 

251.21 259.73 A: and she started out like five fifty i think and now her boss increased her by fifty cents so basically she's only getting six dollars 

254.49 255.44 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

259.69 270.70 A: and actually the reason why she was working was to pay off her monthly fee for her apartment and it's not even enough like she barely has enough money for herself 

270.65 272.06 B: mhm 

270.78 275.91 A: and so it's definitely not much for her it's just enough to pay for her 

273.77 274.45 B: (( mhm )) 

275.85 278.79 B: books oh apartment [noise] right 

276.06 277.32 A: apartment 

278.01 280.25 A: yeah [laughter] 

278.81 285.00 B: but the job she's in is not in a service industry where she's affected by the minimum wage 

284.57 295.47 A: yeah yeah i mean she has to depend on my parents for other needs as well so i mean yeah it's not enough you're right even six dollars doesn't even do you any good 

285.64 287.45 B: uh-huh [noise] 

289.88 291.04 B: mhm 

294.99 296.43 B: no uh-uh 

295.69 305.92 A: yeah i mean i guess you know if you're going to work you need to have a profession in it rather than going to some restaurant or to some shopping store 

300.49 301.75 B: (( right [mn] )) 

303.41 308.66 B: right well this is this is great for like high school kids in the summer you know 

306.84 312.06 A: exactly your minimum wage is meant for high school kids yeah 

309.96 314.49 B: right but then you know when you and and i suppose too 

314.88 329.07 B: ah like your sister in college for a while but then if you're expecting to make any kind of a good salary you have to have the education to back it up or you will forever be stuck in a minimum wage job 

316.80 318.21 A: mhm 

322.43 323.60 A: yeah 

325.04 326.71 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

328.61 330.37 A: yeah 

328.96 340.19 B: and [noise] the the only thi- the thing i notice most is you know the politicians talk forever about raising the minimum wage but it takes years to get it through 

340.04 341.64 A: [laughter] 

340.06 350.50 B: congress [laughter] so to get it from five fifteen to six dollars i i might not still be living when they do that so it it's very hard um i when 

345.62 347.57 A: yeah yeah 

348.65 349.98 A: yeah 

350.29 360.66 B: i can't afford to tip a lot but i do know that the people that are working for minimum wage really depend on it right but ah 

352.37 353.47 A: (( mhm )) 

357.94 364.96 A: depend upon the yeah and some of them actually then put like extra hours in just to yeah 

362.72 366.73 B: mhm yeah over holidays or you know 

365.20 366.91 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

366.82 377.39 B: so in the summer i i suppose if if you're really good at it um and make good tips you that five fifteen might be okay 

371.26 372.76 A: mhm 

377.04 378.72 A: might be okay yeah 

377.93 387.77 B: or but if you're in an adult and um most of the adults like at mcdonalds and places like that are retired people um 

378.79 380.25 A: yeah 

385.25 388.19 A: mhm mhm 

388.12 396.38 B: perhaps um single again through divorce or death and they need just a little extra money to keep them going 

391.99 393.24 A: yeah 

396.05 397.79 A: yeah 

396.40 401.06 B: um because what their pensions are putting out [noise] eh ah isn't enough 

400.97 402.52 A: yeah 

401.09 407.27 B: so they take these um low paying jobs and that's and ah like at mcdonalds 

406.91 407.83 A: mhm 

407.45 412.58 B: they're not getting tips because they're only serving you the food from behind the counter 

411.98 414.04 A: uh-huh yeah 

412.63 416.99 B: so i don't know whether i know when they start out 

416.86 418.06 A: yeah 

417.16 424.46 B: ah they're at minimum wage but how i wonder how long it takes them to work the wa- their way up to 

423.63 432.46 A: yeah i mean even as a full timer i mean i doubt you know it's going to do them any good and even if you're working for certain hours seriously there's no point 

428.38 429.20 B: (( uh-uh uh-uh mm )) 

432.21 433.22 B: well 

432.27 446.51 A: it's just for you know it's just for basically your maybe little stuff you may need like toothbrush or maybe a new towel but i mean it's not going to help you know your car your house your shelter wherever you're living 

433.90 434.50 B: (( mm )) 

439.67 440.71 B: (( uh-huh )) 

443.50 444.58 B: no 

445.71 454.68 B: no and the sad part of that is that a lot of the minimum wage money the five fifteen an hour is taxed so 

451.27 456.62 A: (( mhm mhm it's taxed exactly that's like i say )) 

454.80 460.11 B: you're not really no you're not really seeing the five dollars and fifteen cents 

459.55 460.81 A: yeah 

460.15 461.72 B: ah so 

461.78 464.73 B: i i don't know how high it would have to go 

464.40 465.68 A: yeah 

464.97 466.25 B: to be able to 

466.26 471.77 B: for someone i don't think you could ever support anybody on just minimum wage 

469.85 473.55 A: yeah exactly [laughter] 

471.79 474.71 B: so if if they could just um 

475.08 480.12 B: understand that getting an education is a way to get away from that [noise] 

479.16 480.47 A: yeah 

480.36 487.44 B: but there are situations where that's all they're really um equipped to do ah mm 

486.71 490.01 A: yeah but i mean some like the some of the people you know 

489.85 504.78 A: don't have the money to co- go to college so you know their only choice is to work at a you know like a restaurant or so it's not technically their fault but you know but most of the people they have the opportunity to get a free education and also get a scholarship as well 

494.62 495.74 B: that's right 

495.99 497.46 B: right if you can't 

502.50 503.51 B: (( mhm )) 

504.08 505.55 B: mhm 

504.94 506.50 A: so yeah [laughter] 

505.57 506.40 B: (( so )) 

506.41 515.96 B: the the minimum wage jobs that they take then is just for date money or pin money or you know but 

510.05 510.90 A: uh-huh 

513.70 518.47 A: pin money you know it it's pocket money basically right yeah [laughter] 

516.30 519.52 B: exactly exactly because um 

519.21 520.65 A: yeah 

519.58 524.52 B: they couldn't even depend on those minimum wage jobs to pay for all their books 

524.28 525.59 A: yeah 

524.68 525.60 B: or 

525.98 539.13 B: [mn] other um costs that college has so i you know i i feel sorry for them but on the other hand i can't afford to be a big tipper i give what i think i can 

528.58 529.97 A: yeah 

536.96 538.40 A: yeah 

538.90 540.39 A: yeah 

539.02 546.13 B: when i it makes me sad because i know that that cert- there are people working that that's all they have to rely on 

545.82 551.06 A: yeah minimum wage exactly yeah and that's sad it is 

546.27 547.99 B: is the minimum wage 

548.34 549.37 B: (( so )) 

549.96 553.06 B: have you ever worked in a in a service industry 

552.70 565.02 A: actually i haven't but the only thing i've ever done that's related is tutor someone and i don't know if the pay may sound good to you but i got maybe a hundred dollars a month and that was just my own money 

564.84 569.34 A: it was just my pocket money i wasn't saving it for a particular thing or anything 

567.18 568.69 B: (( [noise] oh mm )) 

568.76 570.27 B: how old were you then 

570.12 576.32 A: actually like i did it recently over the summer and i'm only sixteen so i'm in school right now yeah 

574.05 579.26 B: oh my okay then you do know you have had some jobs that were minimum wage 

577.87 579.54 A: i've had experience 

580.37 581.22 B: um 

580.41 581.94 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

581.28 583.10 B: as a waitress or 

582.84 583.91 A: mhm 

583.44 590.22 B: yeah did you find the tips to to be adequate to add to the minimum wage salary you got 

584.09 585.57 A: yeah 

589.90 597.34 A: well ah like recently [mn] whenever i go out to eat and i tip people it's not very much i mean 'cause i can't afford it i mean myself 

596.21 599.89 B: well that's me too i'm kind of at the other end you're at the young 

599.02 599.89 A: yeah
