37.95 39.71 B: i know [mn] 

39.84 45.28 A: i don't know i i do know there's a lot of people working for that but i don't know how they're making it 

44.84 57.05 B: i can't fathom it i don't i couldn't even i couldn't even take the time to apply for a minimum wage job because it wouldn't [laughter] be worth the the the pay it just wouldn't cover anything 

54.38 55.95 A: [mn] i know 

57.75 61.88 B: i rent here the lowest rent here is six hundred dollars a month 

62.33 67.57 A: [mn] that's about what it is here too and a lot of it you'll see is seven and eight hundred dollars a month 

66.95 70.00 B: exactly the same here this is like 

67.81 73.92 A: [noise] yeah for a small house and when you think about it you go in ah the grocery store 

74.00 74.97 B: uh-huh 

74.25 78.70 A: and if you just get a couple of bags i don't know how somebody with five fifteen an hour 

78.67 79.99 B: i know 

78.79 80.60 A: can even feed their children 

80.49 82.96 B: i can't im- i can't imagine it either 

82.62 88.17 A: [mn] i do [noise] um i have seen a lot ah there seems to be a lot of single mothers here 

88.05 89.10 B: uh-huh 

88.60 90.64 A: um a lot of 'em young 

90.74 97.34 A: um [mn] you know no college education um and no family support 

97.36 103.89 A: and they're working basically probably for five fifteen an hour because i doubt some of these places pay much more than that [noise] 

103.78 104.84 B: right 

104.59 107.84 A: and i i don't know how they're ever going to 

108.19 110.35 A: you know get past that stepping stone 

108.38 109.39 B: (( oh my god )) 

110.37 115.77 B: [noise] it's kind of they're kind of going to be stuck there if they stay at that price range 

115.65 121.40 A: [mn] i know this is one thing i i really think that the government should 

121.55 122.73 A: raise 

121.75 122.37 B: (( h- )) 

122.44 128.78 B: i agree you know i just did it did the multiplication that's eight hundred and thirty dollars a month 

129.15 130.48 A: wh- what is it now 

130.02 133.36 B: it's only eight hundred and thirty dollars a month 

133.15 134.57 A: [mn] that's it 

134.22 142.19 B: that's it so what if you were a single mom you're paying rent you got to buy food for the kids you couldn't do it you'd have to have two jobs 

142.06 150.52 A: mhm [mn] i know i know because if you think about it they ah did that welfare cut ah what was it called welfare to work 

150.28 151.91 B: yes yes 

151.03 156.37 A: and they are cutting these ah women off at i think it's two years 

155.87 156.95 B: mhm 

156.48 160.41 A: and you're not going to get a degree in two years in a lot of things 

159.81 162.49 B: oh goodness no uh-uh [mn] 

161.18 166.05 A: no and i don't know how [mn] it's no wonder you see children without 

167.12 169.02 B: any sort of raising 

169.36 171.45 A: yeah you know or they don't have 

171.68 185.26 A: [mn] i- i'm sure i don't know about up there but up here or like where i live um not where i live but not too far from it you can go to um the corner store an- and you'll see the little kids that just look like they're really poor 

173.81 174.69 B: uh-huh 

178.52 179.46 B: right 

185.47 186.39 A: and it's 

185.50 187.12 B: (( really )) 

186.58 189.57 A: you know the parents probably just aren't making much 

190.27 191.56 B: i see 

191.77 203.81 B: kind of poor kids round here you know around here the state is oregon's falling apart the kids ah only go to school four days a week now 'cause they can't afford to pay teachers to stay for five days 

203.64 205.05 A: are you serious 

204.41 210.99 B: yeah school is down to four days a week and they of course shorten it's a shorter year as well [noise] 

211.00 212.42 A: that's disgusting 

212.14 214.69 B: it's insane and ah 

215.09 221.54 B: what do you do if you're making minimum wage working forty hours a week so you can make eight hundred thirty dollars and your kids can't even 

221.56 225.14 B: like you got to get a babysitter for that time 'cause they can't go to school 

225.55 233.06 A: [mn] i know i i don't know how they do it um ah my son that's seventeen went to work at ah pizza hut 

228.13 229.11 B: (( uh-uh )) 

233.14 234.14 B: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

233.40 239.09 A: and he was all excited 'cause he was going to be just above the minimum wage and after his first pay check 

239.03 240.09 B: it 

239.19 250.89 A: um at five twenty five an hour [laughter] he said i can't believe i worked that hard [laughter] and [laughter] yeah so i used that i used that as a ah 

241.38 242.59 B: [laughter] 

245.24 247.47 B: for so little money 

251.19 252.88 A: you better go to college 

252.28 254.81 B: (( [laughter] good )) 

254.06 255.83 A: unless you want to be poor 

255.60 257.89 B: [laughter] you know 

258.36 267.48 B: [mn] [sigh] i can't i can't imagine it and the problem is there's so many people who would be willing to work for minimum wage because it's better than nothing sort of thing 

267.63 273.42 B: that it m- actually makes competition for minimum wage jobs 

267.76 268.63 A: [noise] true 

273.49 277.55 A: i know but i i i look at myself do you have children 

277.42 278.73 B: (( no i don't )) 

278.40 280.84 A: well even with no children 

281.09 285.92 A: could you imagine all by yourself trying to live on what did you say it is eight hundred 

283.80 284.62 B: (( uh-huh oh )) 

285.18 292.55 B: eight hundred and thirty dollars no way my that would leave me two hundred dollars to pay bills and f- buy food you'd have to get two jobs 

292.44 293.60 A: yeah 

292.50 301.81 B: and then once you have two then once you have two minimum wage jobs you don't have time to look for anything better because you're too busy running to work and 

301.75 308.40 B: if you're working for minimum wage you probably don't have your own transportation so you're spending an hour on the bus getting where you need to go 

308.71 314.56 B: and you don't have time to interview for something that would be a better job and you kind of get trapped i would think 

313.43 319.79 A: [mn] i i would think so too i think you're right um i think it would be you'd be trapped pretty good 

319.29 320.91 B: yeah 

320.27 325.83 A: and um i i i don't know i've i've never um felt like i'm a rich person 

325.49 326.88 B: right [laughter] 

325.76 335.61 A: but i always felt like you know we- we've been lucky because my husband um he does construction but he's always had plenty of work you know being in florida we don't get snow or anything 

333.10 335.10 B: oh yeah 

335.15 337.25 B: right so it's year round 

336.61 338.97 A: yeah and then after um 

338.98 346.28 A: we had our five children then i went to um college afterwards 'cause i never wanted to leave my babies 

344.34 345.02 B: oh 

345.94 347.78 B: good for you though 

346.69 352.25 A: yeah yeah but you know why i f- i feel fortunate because i had a a good working husband and everything 

351.87 352.93 B: uh-huh 

352.38 356.31 A: and if you look at s- even some of these women who 

356.54 359.80 A: ah had husbands before they had children 

359.95 361.92 A: and their husbands don't work 

361.88 362.87 B: yeah 

362.66 364.87 A: what are these poor women supposed to do 

365.45 366.30 B: it's 

367.36 369.90 B: it's fairly unimaginable 

370.20 374.47 B: to me [laughter] i ca- i just can't even fathom living on that [mn] 

374.44 378.36 A: i couldn't either and i could not imagine 

379.36 383.71 A: even the thought of having to say to my child 

383.79 386.38 A: no to everything that they asked for 

385.96 390.08 B: it would have to be everything too with with five fifteen an hour 

389.90 392.86 A: how would they supply their children with school clothes 

392.71 395.72 B: i have no idea none at all 

395.68 405.13 A: even to get school supplies at the beginning of the school i don't know about up there but down here boy you get list after list of things that they need the first two weeks of school 

404.56 405.71 B: yes 

405.32 409.23 A: ah all the way through high school and i don't know how these parents can do it 

409.34 413.43 A: and at eight hundred and something dollars a a month 

412.91 414.47 B: not a chance 

414.44 415.77 A: you'd be hungry 

415.35 416.32 B: yeah 

416.42 420.31 A: and how what about your phone bill you i guess you wouldn't have a phone 

420.54 424.11 B: well yeah but can you imagine not having a phone and having children 

424.48 426.26 B: that would scare me 

424.67 425.64 A: i know 

426.03 427.11 A: i know 

427.42 431.83 A: that's terrible so do you see poverty up there in that state 

431.25 436.94 B: yeah yeah absolutely especially now and a lot of stories of people who 

437.22 440.70 B: in probably any other place would would 

441.03 446.45 B: have great jobs you know these families where they're both educated and 

446.41 455.19 B: and everything's been going great but a lot of middle management is getting cut and all of a sudden they're homeless because there's just no way to pay the rent 

455.12 461.49 B: so yeah you're seeing a lot of poverty and a lot of people who never expected to be in poverty in poverty 

461.23 462.85 A: [noise] [noise] that is so sad 

462.63 474.84 B: it's scary and [mn] i don't understand how letting or making kids not go to school is going to make that situation any better [laughter] 'cause they're just going to be more unemployable in the future 

474.91 478.07 A: yes can you imagine the children 

478.27 480.47 A: or ah you said it's four days a week now 

479.36 481.70 B: [noise] yeah four days a week 

481.26 486.59 A: okay so if it's four days a week and and you imagine ah ah the average child 

486.62 493.92 A: you know n- not the top brain but they're the average intelligence getting cut from school you know the school time 

488.94 489.80 B: yeah 

490.39 491.86 B: yeah 

494.45 498.40 A: what is our country going to be like ten fifteen years from now 

498.06 499.50 B: i don't know but you 

498.63 500.53 A: when they are the ones responsible 

500.23 506.57 B: if you were on some sort of a college board and these kids get to college age and they apply for school 

506.46 518.32 B: my first thought would be uh-oh these are the kids who were living in oregon when there was no sch- you know when school wasn't worth anything and teachers had to work at mcdonalds for minimum wage to supplement their income 

516.20 517.14 A: mhm 

518.81 523.49 B: and ah i bet they didn't pick up as much from school do we really want these kids 

523.78 528.55 A: exactly and ah we have a grandson from our eldest daughter 

528.54 529.48 B: uh-huh 

528.91 538.32 A: and her husband's mother she works at mcdonalds part time while her youngest child you know during the school year and then she's out during the summer 

538.30 545.54 A: just to pick up a few dollars but ah to me if she's getting minimum wage there or a few cents more i wouldn't do it 

539.80 541.03 B: right 

544.91 547.26 B: not a chance it's just not worth it 

547.14 561.14 A: no a- a- and then you've got to pay social security on that i asked her how can she even afford to put gas in her car ah she's not doing it because she absolutely has to [noise] she wanted something different to do but to me that would be like a slap in the face 

553.20 554.51 B: [laughter] 

556.24 557.39 B: right 

560.65 561.83 B: (( yep [noise] )) 

561.58 563.86 A: to stand on your feet all day for that 

563.55 574.32 B: for five fifteen working in an environment like that and making ah it turned out to like two hundred dollars a month if you go full ah two hundred dollars a week if you do full time so 

574.25 581.19 B: she's probably bringing home like a hundred dollars for all that trouble if she's doing half time i'd just go volunteer somewhere 

578.89 579.90 A: yeah 

581.02 585.76 A: [laughter] i would too there's no way [laughter] i couldn't stand to do that and i 

582.35 584.08 B: [laughter] 

585.45 586.59 B: (( no )) 

586.23 595.19 A: i think it's such a shame because i think for um our future generations to be able to do better for themselves the school is where it starts 

594.76 599.89 B: [noise] [noise] i agree i don't think future generations are going to do better i think we're kind of doing a
