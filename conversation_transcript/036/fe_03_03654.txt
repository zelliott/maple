44.34 49.29 A: right i mean at five fifteen an hour how can 

49.63 51.94 A: a person feed 

52.23 56.86 A: themselves much less anybody else i mean five fifteen 

57.08 61.19 A: in a normal working week is forty hours you know 

61.61 64.57 A: that's a little more than what two hundred dollars a week 

64.85 66.35 B: (( exactly )) 

66.22 67.60 A: i'm in 

66.54 67.35 B: (( [mn] )) 

69.98 82.76 A: i'm in atlanta georgia so i know that two hundred dollars a week won't feed [laughter] and clothe and take care of all the necessary things so no i don't think that's um sufficient mhm right 

82.72 92.87 B: no i agree totally you know with you i mean my daughter is twenty one and i have a granddaughter who just turned eleve- uh turned one 

93.17 97.87 B: and um my daughter makes like fifteen dollars an hour 

97.55 98.50 A: right 

98.30 101.38 B: i mean she makes almost double the money i make 

101.19 102.09 A: right 

101.44 103.96 B: you know we live in florid- in tampa 

103.78 104.71 A: uh-huh 

104.34 106.82 B: in florida and [mn] 

107.14 113.10 B: you know i think that's wonderful i mean i don't make nearly as much as she does and 

113.25 124.95 B: you know work for like the school system and you know like you said that money that you said you can't even feed yourself let alone you know if you have a family 

116.54 117.40 A: right

138.04 140.19 A: it's almost like they um 

141.50 151.53 A: wh- and that's an increase of five fifteen so i guess the minimum wage is like four something or you know if there's an increase what is the minimum wage right now 

151.90 157.38 A: so that means um it it causes people to stay 

157.48 160.08 A: in a poverty situation 

160.54 161.67 A: (( you know )) 

162.19 174.16 A: so i think a significant i think fifteen dollars an hour is really good i know the economy blah blah blah but it's according i guess to what you do i'm in healthcare so

196.56 197.55 A: service 

197.65 201.65 A: most likely a minimum wage job
