0.96 2.30 B: hi 

2.63 10.67 A: hi i'm not sure whether i'm participating in this or not i didn't actually fill out the form and i'm not sure how i was contacted 

10.58 13.55 B: huh i just received an email myself 

13.53 17.91 A: oh i didn't did you submit your social security number over the line 

17.82 21.26 B: (( um you know i don't remember )) 

21.26 30.55 A: because when i first when i got to that part i didn't i didn't proceed so i'm just puzzled that i was contacted i don't understand how they got my information 

28.18 29.18 B: huh 

30.52 31.38 B: huh 

30.90 38.77 A: but i also suspect that i won't be paid since i did not give my i will not give out my social security number if it's not prudent 

36.53 37.62 B: uh-huh 

38.92 43.58 A: so i'm not sh- [laughter] you know i don't really [noise] 

42.79 47.07 B: do you have the other number you can call 'em during the day or something and ask 

47.05 48.13 A: um 

47.59 50.45 B: rather than do this call unless you know it's up to you 

50.29 54.79 A: well i i don't want to ruin your chances so ah we should be talking about 

54.45 56.06 B: oh [laughter] 

55.42 61.63 A: [laughter] do you think that minimum wage should be raised beyond five dollars and fifteen cents ah 

60.88 61.94 B: uh-huh 

61.86 63.10 A: what do you think 

62.95 64.23 B: oh sure 

64.44 66.82 A: yeah i think it's ridiculously low 

64.68 65.64 B: yeah 

66.79 67.92 B: uh-huh 

67.83 75.09 A: [noise] it it certainly correlates to um the it's not it's not a question that can be answered in a vacuum because 

75.07 89.16 A: the way money flows through has to do with interest rates and all kinds of things but it just i don't it's it's a topic that i think is out of context in the overall economic mic- macro and micro- um 

89.14 91.33 A: m- macroeconomic ah 

91.38 92.39 A: picture 

92.17 93.39 B: mhm 

93.70 97.71 B: i guess i just looked at it as it's not very [laughter] much money to live on and 

97.74 98.88 B: i know 

99.49 105.64 A: well i i i absolutely believe that but i also think it has to do with um 

99.69 100.44 B: (( ah )) 

106.06 114.70 A: tax flaws and tax cuts that have been passed without interrelated and i don't i think that when you look at one you have to look at all of them simultaneously 

114.42 115.61 B: mhm 

115.11 116.69 A: and um 

117.57 120.20 A: so that's just my overall opinion 

120.36 132.67 B: right it could it could make sense i guess i think too though of the employers that are who are so cheap you know [laughter] like actually my boss is that way where you know i would assume just 

132.92 142.60 B: i would pay people more and rather than say well we only have x amount of money so we'll just you know pay them less um [noise] 

140.43 141.20 A: (( [noise] right )) 

141.82 153.98 A: i think you get what you pay for too [noise] if you pay someone minimum wage and it's not enough for them to live off of then you're not going to get the full attention and full value out of a employee certainly not any loyalty 

142.65 143.55 B: (( well )) 

152.03 153.21 B: yeah 

154.03 158.21 A: you're not going to get any retention i think there's any number of ah 

158.90 166.09 A: [noise] you know it's kind of like if you're going to pay minimum wage you can't expect a whole lot in return 

166.00 179.47 B: yeah well i mean people and i think you know unfortunately a lot of people i mean not a- a lot of people are in jobs that they don't like very much but it's i mean that's probably true of people making 

179.33 182.27 B: a lot more money than minimum wage but 

182.32 193.04 B: i think that it's common to find someone that you know they have a job and it is an income and they do it [laughter] you know it's more like there's not any other options out there 

193.17 203.52 A: well i think minimum wage if you're in a situation where you're being you're being paid minimum wage you're spending a good part of your time looking for another job that doesn't pay minimum wage 

203.65 207.98 A: i think it's a filler because no-one can live on minimum wage 

205.00 206.23 B: mhm 

207.43 217.69 B: yeah well i don't know i've forgotten there's a book written about ah something about um how people can't live on minimum wage and it's about i think it focussed on 

218.65 223.43 B: kmart or one of those type st- or walmart or something 

223.64 232.91 B: but anyway i i didn't read the ol- thing the whole thing a friend of mine had just finished reading it and she passed it on to me and i haven't you know i've only read a part of it but 

232.83 245.90 B: you know basically pointing out that there is a lot of people in this world that do work for [laughter] very little and and you [laughter] cannot survive on it i mean you can't you have affor- afford to go to the doctors or [laughter] you know 

241.71 243.51 A: no you can't survive 

246.24 247.37 B: so 

246.79 250.11 A: a lot of the minimum wage jobs do not have benefits 

250.10 252.54 B: exactly yeah 

251.93 257.54 A: so um but the only people i know that actually live on minimum wage 

257.59 261.71 A: live in group living situations and um 

263.18 265.92 A: have to c- either basically 

266.87 271.37 A: ah supporting their income with other forms of 

271.43 276.85 A: support ah and and to look at and [noise] into types of assets um 

274.20 275.22 B: mhm 

277.58 278.39 A: but 

278.81 281.12 A: it's interesting how long ten minutes takes 

280.52 288.35 B: yeah where where are you calling from just out of curiosity it's funny 'cause usually i've had two other calls and so this is my third and one 

288.38 291.19 B: they always say you're going to be talking to 

291.47 294.47 B: shirley in seattle which [laughter] is where i'm at 

294.17 305.82 A: well i'm sam and i'm on the east coast but i think the reason why they didn't do that is because i didn't give my name i didn't i literally did not fill this form out i'm not i'm very puzzled as to how they got my telephone number 

306.02 312.12 A: i didn't send i didn't transmit it once i got to the part that i had to fill in my social security number 

311.80 312.88 B: mhm 

312.40 316.41 A: i deleted all the information and did not 

316.50 321.45 A: transmit it so i find it very interesting that despite that they had my telephone number 

317.87 319.07 B: huh 

322.17 328.24 A: and i'm sure i won't get paid 'cause they don't have my name and they don't have my social security number have you ever gotten paid for this 

324.46 325.41 B: (( oh )) 

327.79 339.04 B: no i haven't but the person that forwarded me the email she's a linguistics major at the college and she's gone done this before with them 

333.69 334.66 A: uh-huh 

338.04 351.35 A: she got paid 'cause there's there are a bunch of emails floating around saying that this is a scam and so on and so forth and that you don't get paid and i really don't know one way or the other but ten minutes of my time at this time of the hour i can afford 

339.19 340.28 B: yeah 

350.72 361.82 B: yeah [laughter] i was going to actually well i can't remember if i tried i was going to call 'cause they give you another number that you can call during the day and that if you have other questions to ask 'cause i am just curious how the 

359.56 360.48 A: mhm 

361.89 364.45 B: the research is used and 

364.39 366.80 A: [noise] well um 

366.67 376.61 A: if the honorarium was more than ten dollars i probably would take my time to do it but to to find out what's going on with this and how they got my number but 

376.45 382.53 A: at this point as far as i'm concerned my time is worth much more than it would take to get to the bottom of this so 

381.88 386.00 B: [laughter] yeah i don't think it'll i mean i i don't know um 

385.58 392.41 A: i found it very interesting that i did not submit the form yet 'cause you have to act- you know you have to actually hit the transmit button 

392.12 393.10 B: uh-huh 

392.62 396.97 A: and despite that they were able to get my information i find that very peculiar 

396.72 398.74 B: yeah that's just 

398.10 399.08 A: yeah 

398.86 402.66 B: oh i'll have to ask our computer expert about that at work 

402.10 411.52 A: yeah um i went through and i deleted all the information that i i you know i initially put into the form as soon as i saw that they were asking for the social security number 

411.19 412.17 B: mhm 

411.69 415.42 A: and um i quit you know i didn't continue 

415.24 416.34 B: mhm 

415.46 416.50 A: and um 

416.66 420.96 A: they still were able to record that a little scary isn't it [laughter] 

420.59 428.79 B: [laughter] yeah i don't care for the internet or the computer stuff that much i guess they are worthwhile in a lot of ways but 

428.72 436.86 B: i'm more of a i like to communicate [laughter] in person and i don't want to sit in front of a computer screen when i [laughter] come home at night and 

436.75 443.81 A: well it has it's purposes but i don't think it's a good form of socializing particularly so what's the weather like in seattle 

438.44 439.45 B: yeah 

441.04 442.32 B: no i don't 

443.20 444.43 B: oh it's 

444.72 447.98 B: it's almost sunny today but it's really been colder 

447.84 459.86 B: you know not freezing cold but it just ca- we haven't had hardly any days in the sixties where normally by now we'd we'd be hitting low sixties so it was like low forties the other morning and 

453.19 454.05 A: (( mm )) 

459.75 463.12 B: it just seems like our last few springs haven't been that good 

462.77 463.57 A: (( mm )) 

463.92 470.15 A: well boston actually the best time of year is in the summer and the fall and i'm not originally from here and ah 

470.65 473.99 A: this year has made me much more committed to 

474.35 476.35 A: moving away [laughter] 

475.69 476.91 B: oh 

476.90 478.21 A: yeah 

477.55 479.93 B: just is the weather too extreme or 

479.56 490.00 A: oh it's cold and i'm i'm from the south and i really am realising i just prefer to be in a climate where i can where one layer of clothing and let and be done with it 

480.77 481.60 B: (( mm )) 

484.87 485.75 B: (( mm )) 

489.40 499.31 B: yeah i'm thinking i'd like to live at some place where the winters aren't so long i mean we have mild winters but we get too much of the grey rainy stuff you know so 

498.41 501.92 A: yeah that's what i that's what everyone here with respect to ah 

502.26 505.52 A: you know seattle i haven't act- i've never been there 

503.34 504.32 B: mhm 

505.26 506.20 B: mhm 

505.81 509.54 A: um but i was just curious what the weather was like at this time of year 

509.13 522.75 B: yeah it's you know it could be in the sixties and you know it should be in the sixties by now and we should have like seventies in june and that but like last summer i don't think we had one week of ninety degree weather 

522.97 536.70 B: we had mainly seventies which is pleasant and some eighties but i don't know i like to have like a week of ninety degree weather my mother lives in vancouver washington which is near portland oregon for three three hours south of here 

525.91 526.93 A: (( oh yeah )) 

534.18 535.14 A: mhm 

536.65 548.50 B: and there it's always like six degrees or so t- warmer there so in the spring last year i called down to her and it's oh yeah seventy five it's really nice here i'm like you know we're barely approaching [laughter] seventy it's just 

548.25 550.42 A: you know you can always go for a visit huh 

548.65 549.71 B: (( oh )) 

550.22 553.56 B: i do i do quite a bit so but 

552.64 553.48 A: mhm 

553.38 566.00 B: anyway but you know by this time of the year everybody's just ready for it i mean when the sun comes out and that you just feel like you haven't seen it for [laughter] five months you forget that two weeks ago we did have a sunny day [laughter] 

556.56 557.89 A: oh i'm sure 

565.16 566.37 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

565.84 572.36 B: it does i never thought that the darkness and that of winter bothered me but it really does affect me 

571.92 579.69 A: well i bet that's what i've come to realise here and ah i'm used to full sun 'cause i'm from new orl- new orleans and it's just so different 

579.72 583.31 A: well did you i don't have anything more to say about minimum wage do you 

579.80 580.61 B: (( mm )) 

582.48 590.11 B: yeah i guess we covered it as well as i i can't really think of it either so i think just let it go and do 

589.94 594.09 A: well what happ- are we supposed to be waiting for some sort of ending signal 

592.71 599.89 B: oh yeah it'll come on and it'll say you know your time minute your time is up and you can take thirty or you can 

597.27 598.43 A: oh okay
