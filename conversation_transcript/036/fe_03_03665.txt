8.81 10.21 A: (( [noise] uh )) 

10.47 19.87 A: topic we're supposed to talk about i suppose is minimum wage i guess it just went up to five dollars i don't think that's i'm from massachusetts where're you from 

19.87 21.61 B: california 

21.08 27.76 A: california well i don't think that california [noise] or massachusetts for five dollars 

28.03 31.37 A: uh would be sufficient for anything 

30.62 31.87 B: oh really 

31.52 32.83 A: do you uh 

33.09 40.30 B: well i think it's not i don't think it's enough for anything actually but i think in california the minimum wage is higher 

37.85 39.47 A: mhm 

39.95 43.04 A: [noise] the minimum wage is higher than five 

42.49 46.33 B: yeah it's like it's like six twenty five here 

43.38 44.75 A: oh what is it 

45.45 46.96 A: (( [noise] uh )) 

46.73 49.14 B: it's like six dollars and twenty five here 

49.15 51.41 A: [noise] oh it's six twenty five already [noise] 

51.49 52.40 B: yeah 

51.69 60.92 A: so just read the federal i guess here it's five dollars and i don't i don't know six twenty five does that cut anything down that way 

61.11 68.51 B: yeah it's pretty good like if you work a couple a hours and you work like all five days of the week you probab- you get a good enough amount 

68.69 71.35 A: it will it pay rent and buy groceries 

71.29 78.42 B: well not really but most of the time if you're like paying rent and bagging groceries you get like another job 

78.65 79.47 A: (( oh )) 

80.09 81.05 A: um 

82.51 85.45 A: [lipsmack] so it's inadequate for a uh 

85.99 94.03 A: [noise] an an adult with a family but but it'd be okay for a a young adult uh 

88.23 90.58 B: yeah well i don't have a family 

93.91 97.16 B: yeah it'd be okay for like a college student i think or i 

95.94 97.68 A: [noise] college kids 

97.23 100.39 B: or like a high school teen or something 

99.42 104.57 A: [noise] mhm do you think there should be two separate minimum wages 

105.06 106.92 B: um what d'ya mean 

106.86 110.72 A: well i've heard proposed before a minimum wage for um 

111.71 115.69 A: [lipsmack] people of uh who are in high school and what not 

116.03 118.78 A: and then one uh for families 

119.06 121.86 B: mm yeah i guess that's pretty good 

120.67 131.67 A: som- somebody over twenty one or or or a different minimum wage uh for do two separate groups somebody over twenty one and somebody under twenty one 

132.16 134.69 B: so uh how would that work 

133.96 139.87 A: with maybe a college exemption i don't know i've heard it talked about in years past 

140.40 141.89 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

140.83 143.05 A: did you ever heard of that 

142.17 147.16 B: well i don't know i don't hear that much in here in california you're in massachusetts

160.33 161.62 A: [lipsmack] and uh 

161.99 163.05 B: (( oh )) 

162.21 165.34 A: evidently california has their own that's higher 

165.60 167.98 A: which i think is good because um 

169.04 178.42 A: [noise] probably in california here in massachusetts it's five dollars isn't doesn't buy probably as much as other places let's say in the mid wet west 

178.83 180.71 B: yeah i would say so 

180.59 183.17 A: see an average home

248.12 252.70 A: and my wages are are close to twenty an hour 

253.57 254.98 B: do you think that's enough 

253.76 254.54 A: um 

254.85 255.76 A: (( [noise] uh )) 

255.42 257.01 B: you think that's enough 

257.57 259.99 A: not really no 

260.36 262.91 A: not for the things i'd like 

262.02 263.08 B: [laughter] 

263.06 263.93 A: so 

264.20 269.00 A: my children are grown i have grandchildren around my children are grown 

266.28 267.21 B: (( oh )) 

269.20 271.68 A: uh and i don't have 

271.95 276.95 A: well i guess i do have as much obligations because i help my parents out too you know 

276.94 279.38 B: oh yeah you gotta watch out for your parents 

279.54 284.56 A: yeah 'cause they're in they're in their eighties and i have to help them but anyhow 

285.06 291.62 A: [cough] i don't think five dollars even six and a quarter is good enough what would you think about 

291.83 293.42 A: [lipsmack] i often thought 

294.42 296.51 A: a minimum wage of uh 

297.05 299.35 A: closer to ten dollars an hour 

299.88 305.01 A: [lipsmack] with government subsidies to companies who are willing to pay for that 

302.09 303.02 B: yeah 

304.80 313.45 B: you know i think that would be pretty good actually 'cause then uh them people wouldn't worry about welfare too much either it's not easier on the government 

311.00 312.89 A: (( but )) 

313.22 314.68 A: uh a- and then um 

315.24 319.48 A: uh at ten dollars an hour with government subsidies uh 

319.66 325.86 A: it'd increase the tax base and what not too 'cause more people'd be working and then uh 

326.55 329.94 A: the different companies could use that money 

329.95 335.71 A: uh let's say even like mcdonald's and those fast food place could use that money to increase their business 

335.63 336.70 B: (( yeah exa- )) 

335.83 337.88 A: and of course pay more taxes 

337.95 339.99 B: yeah exactly 

338.84 340.10 A: in the long run 

341.97 350.78 A: [noise] i think a program like that would uh be much better than just the base minimum wage of of of whatever dole amount 

342.11 343.02 B: are you 

347.21 348.10 B: yeah 

350.14 352.90 B: so in massachusetts it's five dollars 

352.98 356.57 A: uh i yes i guess so it would be 

356.69 358.13 B: wow that's pretty low 

357.19 362.06 A: they announced the uh federal federal is five i guess in new hampshire 

362.09 367.53 A: they go up to six and a quarter i mean i'm sorry in california where you are 

367.78 371.16 A: it must be a state regulated six twenty five 

371.53 373.81 B: yeah i live near san francisco 

373.69 380.54 A: [lipsmack] yeah and uh i guess across the country the minimum's five and i think california has 

381.05 383.53 A: made the right move because uh [lipsmack] 

384.47 394.25 A: like i say i think massachusetts california probably new york and florida some some of the bigger states a- are the small popular states 

394.51 395.43 A: uh 

396.65 400.17 A: uh it the cost of living is more and the uh 

400.40 407.85 A: minimum wage should reflect that [lipsmack] where somewhere in uh georgia not to pick on georgia 

403.55 404.46 B: (( mm )) 

407.67 408.47 B: [laughter] 

408.03 421.54 A: in the hills i- i- it may not cost quite as much to buy a home to rent a home to buy the groceries uh what would it cost let's say [lipsmack] what'd be the average rent for a uh four room apartment would you know 

421.75 435.23 B: um over here actually it fluctuates with where ever you live like if you live near like a big city like san francisco it's pretty expensive but if you live like in farming place like rural and 

422.01 422.61 A: (( [noise] )) 

434.70 436.07 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

435.05 437.84 B: it's less it really depends on where you are 

437.60 440.88 A: yeah yeah let's say um 

440.91 441.52 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

441.55 445.12 A: would you be familiar with the rates in the inner city 

445.13 446.75 B: with what city 

446.21 449.63 A: the rates of uh rental in the inner city 

449.69 457.84 B: um not particularly 'cause like the place where i am it's near the city but it's kinda it's really suburban 

451.15 452.03 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

453.75 454.55 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

457.90 458.81 A: (( [noise] ah )) 

459.67 460.92 A: and of course 

461.27 468.07 A: [lipsmack] if you live suburban uh inner city california it really there's no way to be without a car 

467.71 469.84 B: yeah exactly 

469.16 473.86 A: [noise] there's is no way to go to work there's no way to do anything 

472.26 476.34 B: yeah it's important to have a car here uh how is it like in massachusetts 

474.16 475.09 A: (( [noise] )) 

476.10 485.39 A: [lipsmack] well it it's pretty important a good public transportation 'cause i'm in a city uh but you really need a car as well 

485.31 493.12 A: uh 'cause there are a lot of jobs that i could walk to you know in my area um 

493.84 497.22 A: yeah you you need a car here too [laughter] i suppose 

498.06 498.93 A: (( uh )) 

499.32 500.85 A: do you have a car 

500.79 502.23 B: (( hm yeah ))

514.40 515.94 A: a gallon of milk 

515.92 518.33 B: gallon of milk yeah 

517.62 521.54 A: yeah what would that cost in california 

521.30 524.86 B: like uh around like a dollar fifty 

524.91 525.99 A: (( [noise] hm )) 

526.49 528.01 A: are you sure 

527.77 528.80 B: yeah

531.88 532.86 A: uh 

532.08 540.00 B: yeah i guess over here 'cause you know berkley farms and then uh it's kinda near it's really near here so i guess it's cheaper i guess 

539.81 541.17 A: (( uh uh )) 

541.71 542.81 A: (( [lipsmack] so [lipsmack] )) 

543.36 544.62 A: i guess uh 

545.06 549.65 A: [noise] [lipsmack] the minimum wage really should reflect where you live 

549.53 551.54 B: (( yeah i think that would )) 

550.01 554.33 A: and the cost of uh basic needs like groceries and uh 

554.86 558.53 A: [noise] anyhow groceries and and and the cost of renting 

558.46 559.76 B: (( yeah definitely )) 

559.01 563.85 A: or owning well [noise] more like renting if we're talking minimum wage 

565.05 570.34 A: i've heard a lot of people in new york they do work in yet they still can't afford a 

565.28 566.14 B: (( [noise] )) 

570.83 577.42 A: an apartment they work jobs like mcdonald's and you know which is okay nothing wrong with that uh [lipsmack] 

577.94 581.52 A: but uh they still have to live in shelters
