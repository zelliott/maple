0.35 1.51 B: (( hello )) 

1.43 2.55 A: hi 

2.38 4.42 B: hey this is scott who's this 

4.14 6.13 A: this is matt how's it going scott 

5.05 5.72 B: hey 

5.87 7.45 B: good man how're you doing 

7.19 9.45 A: pretty good um 

8.23 11.13 B: how d'ya feel uh how do you feel about the minimum wage 

10.94 16.33 A: well uh i don't think it's enough i mean i don't think i could possibly survive on five fifteen an hour 

16.47 23.44 A: and uh i think it needs to be increased by i mean at least double like ten dollars an hour should be minimum 

22.59 26.41 B: yeah i agree with you i think that that's probably about right 

25.94 27.87 A: yeah yeah 'cause 

26.74 34.55 B: i think there's no way to uh to survive and like pay rent and feed yourself uh on on five fifteen an hour it's ridiculous 

31.60 33.27 A: (( yeah )) 

34.32 39.43 A: yeah absolutely not i mean that works out to forty bucks a day or you know two hundred dollars a week which 

39.31 52.43 A: you know uh rent i don't think rent anywhere's two hundred dollars a month and they say that you should be able to pay your rent with uh one week's salary so right there that's that's evidence enough as far as i'm concerned 

43.26 44.43 B: yeah 

47.73 48.78 B: right 

51.83 58.10 B: yeah i agree i mean rent some places are two hundred but those are places where there wouldn't be a ton of minimum wage jobs anyway so 

57.99 59.82 A: yeah exactly 

58.86 60.96 B: it wouldn't really help people out 

60.64 71.98 A: exactly yeah i mean the thing that really kills me is you know companies like walmart or whatever paying their their employees five fifteen an hour while they're you know reporting record profits that kind of thing it's terrible 

70.83 72.98 B: yeah exactly 

72.47 74.17 A: yeah 

73.26 74.49 B: so uh 

74.84 78.10 B: what are you you think the uh you think the minimum wage should be like ten bucks 

78.31 80.51 A: i think ten dollars i mean uh 

80.43 94.32 A: i mean i i live here in l._a. so it's it's a little more expensive out here but i think pretty much everywhere you know four hundred dollars a week is probably the minimum of what it takes to really truly live comfortably you know in america 

83.63 85.05 B: yeah 

93.62 103.08 B: yeah i agree i agree but uh there's some use i mean there's obviously some use for jobs that are minimum wage jobs for like high school students and stuff like that who uh 

103.23 106.98 B: you know are living at home or aren't supporting themselves and just like earning spending money 

107.05 116.15 A: that's true i mean maybe they should have like a uh you know uh uh um loophole for people who are dependents you know can be claimed as a dependent 

115.16 119.76 B: yeah exactly or maybe under a certain age or something like that 

119.45 122.18 A: yeah yeah i think that would be 

122.42 127.45 A: that would be the way to go you know i mean uh don't make the rule uh 

123.46 124.40 B: yeah 

127.62 130.54 A: based on the exception to the rule you know make so- 

129.53 130.96 B: yeah 

130.65 133.17 A: make some bylaws for the exception 

132.39 135.87 B: yeah i agree with that so you uh you live out in l._a. 

133.84 134.77 A: yeah 

135.61 136.44 A: uh-huh 

136.19 137.69 B: how do you like it out there 

136.49 141.02 A: yep oh it's real nice real warm right now yeah 

139.41 142.52 B: nice yeah i'm actually i'm moving there this summer 

142.51 144.65 A: oh really no kidding which 

143.40 149.29 B: yeah yeah i got just for just for the summer i'm in school so i got a summer job there so i'm pretty psyched to go out there 

148.78 150.40 A: that's cool where you got a summer job 

150.22 154.15 B: uh it's uh i'm in law school so it's with a law firm out there 

153.66 154.89 A: oh yeah 

154.17 155.55 B: yeah 

155.04 157.62 A: right i got a friend right here working working law 

157.38 158.57 B: oh really 

158.23 161.05 A: yeah out in uh santa monica firm out there 

160.43 161.82 B: oh that's cool 

161.55 163.44 A: yeah what kinda law you wanna get into 

163.11 174.11 B: um i don't really know at this point i'm in my first year so i'm kinda undecided the firm the firm i'm working with does a lot of litigation work so i'm gonna test that out and see if that's pretty interesting seems like it could be a pretty good way to go 

170.15 170.95 A: uh-huh 

172.28 173.33 A: that's cool 

174.26 179.85 A: yeah i can see that you get to litigation means take it to trial right oh nice 

177.43 179.31 B: yeah exactly 

179.50 186.11 B: so uh it's a little more exciting i think than just like contract and paperwork so i i think that'd be pretty interesting 

185.52 188.52 A: yeah there's definitely a performance aspect to that right 

187.76 189.90 B: yeah yeah absolutely 

189.41 194.85 A: do they teach you that in school i mean do they teach you kind of uh techniques for public speaking or whatever or are they 

194.35 208.94 B: um not really i mean there's a lot of public speaking involved so like just as a as a byproduct of being in the classroom and certain exercises they make you do but they don't really teach you like trial techniques unless you take i i guess some schools offer purely trial classes but uh 

209.25 209.95 A: (( uh )) 

209.69 213.88 B: um i don't think it's standard i think you just kind of learn on the job 

213.90 221.43 A: wow that's really interesting so your first day in a court like it you'd be really freaking petrified [laughter] 

215.00 215.97 B: yeah 

218.77 227.68 B: yeah yeah i imagine you would be i'm a [laughter] i mean this summer'll probably be pretty nerve wracking but uh should be good should be how long have you lived in l._a. for all 

225.22 226.27 A: that's cool uh 

226.91 228.41 A: about two years now 

228.26 229.66 B: right 

229.27 236.66 A: yeah yeah so what do you actually i mean are you doing a summer internship or do you have like a summer job with uh with the firm 

236.49 242.28 B: uh no it's a it's a summer job with the firm uh it's a small firm in uh in downtown l._a. 

238.93 239.84 A: (( oh wow )) 

242.57 243.38 A: wow 

243.95 245.40 B: yeah it's uh 

244.06 245.33 A: (( it's it's )) 

245.50 252.51 B: yeah it's pretty good i mean there's uh there's there's a good percentage of first years who actually get jobs and then like yeah i think 

252.56 261.28 B: probably more than half do end up doing like internships or clerking for judges and stuff like that which is also which is also good work but definitely need to make a little money too 

259.12 261.06 A: (( sounds great )) 

261.36 266.52 A: yeah [laughter] no kidding no kidding doesn't hurt especially with the law school bills and stuff 

262.63 264.18 B: yeah 

266.08 268.24 B: yeah absolutely 

267.79 271.80 A: yep how'd you find out this uh this thing

272.17 277.64 B: um actually found it online on on a crepe list i don't know what it's gonna 

275.81 278.10 A: yeah that's how i found it too 

277.74 281.17 B: oh really is this have you done one of these calls before or is this your first one 

278.66 279.45 A: uh-huh 

280.91 282.57 A: i i did one yesterday

298.47 302.28 A: oh yeah no i don't think they care about that as long as your ten minutes 

300.28 301.37 B: okay 

301.95 303.89 B: (( all right )) 

302.86 306.04 A: yeah be real curious to see if they actually pay you you know 

305.78 314.24 B: yeah [laughter] i agree it's i mean either way i mean obviously i'm doing it for the money but it's not a ton of money and you know it's kind of a funny thing anyway 

306.85 308.74 A: [laughter] 

310.89 311.77 A: yeah 

314.02 322.11 A: yeah it is sort of funky it sucks people from like i talked to a guy yesterday from north carolina who uh yeah you know just different perspectives i guess 

318.12 319.18 B: oh really

346.09 348.14 B: that's good 

350.52 358.54 A: you uh i- i- it rains something like fifty percent more in the weekends 'cause there's less cars on the road so there's less smog to keep the rain out 

358.08 359.42 B: oh are you serious 

359.23 360.68 A: (( yeah isn't that wild )) 

360.34 362.08 B: that's pretty strange 

361.78 364.65 A: (( yeah yeah smog )) 

363.43 369.75 B: wow i've never heard of that that's pretty weird that uh i guess it's too bad though 'cause it ruins uh interferes with weekend plans more 

369.54 380.66 A: yeah yeah it's uh it's a funny statistic uh [laughter] but that's one thing you're gonna watch out for here in l._a. especially being downtown man the smog here is abysmal i mean it's terrible 

372.50 373.59 B: yeah 

380.46 385.07 B: that's what i've heard i've been to visit a few times and it seems like it's pretty bad
