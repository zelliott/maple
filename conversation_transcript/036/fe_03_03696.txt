12.73 15.79 A: well this is only my second [laughter] so ah 

15.81 21.65 A: um have you ah have you ever had a job where you had to work for minimum wage 

21.55 23.41 B: when i was a teenager 

23.02 24.25 A: yeah 

23.82 25.38 B: many years ago 

24.90 27.85 A: yeah that's kind of um 

28.03 42.50 A: the ones i see [mn] mostly are the waiters and waitresses and ah certainly no one could ah support a a wife or children on this um it's great for kids you know on summer vacation 

36.13 37.27 B: oh no 

38.19 39.47 B: [noise] no 

41.37 43.55 B: for a supplementary income 

42.95 44.82 A: right right 

43.99 44.73 B: for 

44.77 50.41 B: buying those brand named tennis shoes but not for paying rent or mortage [laughter] 

48.58 53.74 A: ooh [laughter] or putting meal- three meals on the table a day either but 

53.05 54.61 B: exactly 

54.02 66.24 A: um unfortunately in the service industry um the actual um pay is so low that they have to try to supplement it with ah tips 

66.22 73.22 A: and i i i have never actually done that i don't have a memory good enough to [laughter] to be a waitress or remember who 

66.45 67.40 B: right 

71.66 77.37 B: yeah i've done that i've worked for two dollars and seventeen cents an hour 

73.32 74.52 A: [laughter] have you 

76.81 78.26 A: oh really 

77.99 86.57 B: plus tips and that was permitted in the restaurant industry and and then you were allow to report if your tips did not bring your wages to minimum wage 

81.09 82.14 A: uh-huh 

86.21 87.80 A: oh really [noise] 

87.31 90.19 B: an- and they would compensate you for the difference the 

90.21 91.72 B: the restaurant 

91.10 95.34 A: hm and what was the minimum wage then and how long ago was that oh my 

95.25 100.36 B: oh it was probably around three thirty five back then this is back in the eighties 

98.85 101.21 A: gosh oh my gosh 

101.56 104.18 B: yeah 'cause i i'm thirty eight so 

101.64 102.43 A: well 

103.29 106.50 A: [noise] oh well i'm older than that [laughter] 

106.11 109.04 B: [laughter] 

106.61 113.53 A: um in fact i'm legally old as as of december [laughter] but you know [laughter] but 

112.44 117.23 B: [laughter] that's when you get to start realizing a lot of benefits you know [laughter] 

115.57 123.33 A: well yeah but it's um time for uncle sam to pay me and hopefully more than the minimum wage would be 

123.12 124.57 B: [laughter] 

123.36 127.15 A: but i would i really would h- hate to have to 

127.19 131.89 A: depend on a job where the most money you get is from tips 

131.95 143.17 A: i'm in a mountain community in north carolina and it's basically i mean it's based on tourism so in the winter when we're having bad weather a lot of the restaurants and motels 

132.08 133.20 B: oh right 

138.50 139.45 B: mhm 

143.06 148.98 A: close down here so that puts a lot of people out of work for the winter season 

147.80 153.91 B: so if they aren't able to save during their times of prosperity then they're going those months without any income whatsoever 

150.91 151.77 A: yeah 

152.72 153.62 A: sure 

153.63 158.07 A: so they're working mostly from memorial day through 

158.08 168.09 A: october and then um a lot of the people who visit here are from florida or texas some of the hotter places and they all go back home 

167.89 180.24 A: and the industries here can't ah afford to pay all the workers so they all get laid off [noise] and have to do something um they i they do have a couple of ski areas here 

174.17 175.16 B: yeah 

180.22 192.89 A: i don't know whether um that's based on minimum wage and salary or salary alone [noise] but it would be really hard to wo- you know i think they work pretty hard for what money they get 

185.23 186.23 B: mhm 

189.19 190.19 B: yeah 

192.48 203.47 B: well i'm i'm in albuquerque new mexico and and ah the cost of living here is quite low however as you might imagine we have quite a few illegal aliens [laughter] 

194.27 195.73 A: [noise] oh my 

202.24 202.83 A: (( mm )) 

203.08 209.77 A: well we lived in texas for twenty years and we watched tapes every night on the news of them swimming across the guada- 

203.48 204.40 B: and 

208.75 210.79 B: being rounded up [laughter] 

210.08 214.22 A: yeah but swimming across the guadalupe river so it wouldn't be 

213.15 219.10 B: it was just on my news last night too a big van you know was stopped with [laughter] 

216.30 220.02 A: mhm mhm yeah 

219.40 224.15 B: but so this legislation i guess is ah in consideration right now 

223.54 229.52 A: yes to to i- it seems [noise] impossible that they're rais- they want to raise it to five fifteen 

229.64 233.51 A: i mean i really i would have thought that they would be pushing 

232.44 234.25 B: what is it what is it currently 

234.07 238.15 A: i don't i think it's under five dollars if i'm not mistaken 

238.25 247.85 A: so but even at five dollars and fifteen cents that's really low even if you're a single person trying to put food on the table 

246.66 251.96 B: i'm i'm wondering how it's going to impact smaller businesses whether it's going to be difficult for them to 

251.72 253.77 A: yeah i i don't 

252.71 254.15 B: afford to pay their 

253.86 267.14 A: i don't think they're going to take much action on it right now because the the economy is in such trouble and as far as i know it's on the table but they haven't they haven't voted or moved on any [noise] um 

267.50 269.01 A: vote for the 

269.02 271.05 A: on the minimum wage they 

269.51 270.63 B: right 

270.66 278.76 B: an- and ironically president bush is um trying to pass this ah bill to cut taxes all round 

278.14 278.81 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

279.23 280.70 B: so 

280.13 282.99 A: yeah i know [noise] it's um 

282.30 283.69 B: well i'm i mean 

283.94 289.01 B: i'm in support of it if if as long as it doesn't hurt other necessary services 

288.43 289.90 A: right that's 

289.23 293.57 B: you know i mean the money's got to come from somewhere so where are they going to pull the money from [laughter] 

291.05 292.29 A: (( true right [noise] )) 

292.80 303.14 A: well you know it really ah upsets me when uh nasa will spend six hundred dollars for a toilet seat that you can buy at lowes for ten dollars you know 

300.11 301.80 B: oh yeah 

302.70 303.86 B: mhm 

303.10 308.63 A: so if they would find a way to cut some of that unnecessary spending 

308.70 315.51 A: and put it into these other programs that really help the the lower class or the lower middle class 

315.57 321.70 A: that's where part of the money could come from but [noise] every senator and every congressman [laughter] 

320.19 322.72 B: i i i agree wholeheartedly 

322.76 334.84 A: they ah they have to promise their constituents that they'll bring the back home so that they can get re-elected and in the meantime the little people kind of get shuffled around and 

333.76 338.11 B: [sigh] i think we need to run for office we know how to spend this money [laughter] 

335.61 348.47 A: [laughter] well yeah i could do that my husband was with the c._i._a. for a long time and we lived just outside of washington and oh it's just the political arena is it's like 

347.12 354.16 B: [noise] oh they they need to learn how to cut coupons and maybe have their breakfast at denny's instead of [laughter] 

350.52 351.88 A: mhm [laughter] 

353.06 365.18 A: right well see this is the problem they've never been where we are they i mean to be in politics you have to have money to start with so when it comes to things like minimum wage and the lower class 

361.21 362.21 B: mhm 

365.16 374.50 A: americans they don't have anything to refer to because they've never been at that rung on the ladder and if they have it's been a long time ago so 

373.94 377.54 B: oh and they've probably assumed that many of these people such as you know 

377.61 388.87 B: the stereotypical welfare recipient that if they worked hard enough that they could pull themselves up by their boot straps but some people their their circumstances are such that [noise] um 

381.85 382.85 A: (( mhm right )) 

389.05 394.32 B: you know you've got to have money to make money [laughter] so to speak i mean they need a good education you 

391.37 392.58 A: (( mhm mhm that's )) 

393.14 400.16 A: well or as i say the rich get richer and the poor get children [laughter] there's just more mouths to feed you know 

399.82 404.07 B: know and [sigh] i g- i got a couple of them [laughter] 

400.18 402.25 A: (( [laughter] so )) 

403.16 407.07 A: [laughter] okay [laughter] yeah it's um 

404.94 406.42 B: (( [noise] [mn] [noise] )) 

407.24 410.03 A: ah in washington now they 

410.54 415.10 A: everything is at such a high level but they they don't really stop to think 

415.04 427.33 A: i mean at at the time that they're running for office they're going to promise you the moon including you know lower taxes better minimum wage better this and that and then once they're elected do you ever hear from them again 

427.35 441.52 A: you know they want your vote and your money and then be quiet for four years and the the people that are trying to live on the minimum wage um they have no voice at all so we're stuck in the middle paying for the 

431.31 432.49 B: mhm 

442.02 454.32 A: the wealthy people who don't have to pay their share because of loopholes and then [noise] we're also paying part of the poor people and we're just stuck here in the middle you know there's we can't pass the buck anywhere 

453.49 459.74 B: [noise] [noise] well i'd certainly like to know how my tax dollars are being spent [mn] in a more specific way 

459.41 460.10 A: (( mm mm )) 

459.84 461.79 B: such as at the pump [laughter] 

461.52 464.15 A: [laughter] well yeah um 

463.57 467.18 B: and that's a whole 'nother conversation i guess [laughter] [noise] 

465.10 470.50 A: well [laughter] they they need to make that another topic for an- for another night 

470.41 483.10 A: but um [mn] i i personally don't think that five dollars and fifteen cents if they're coming up to that i don't think that's really sufficient at all but e for every 

483.25 493.09 A: um fifty cent increase it takes that much more legislation and all we know that politicians talk a lot but there's very little action 

486.07 486.98 B: mhm 

488.22 488.95 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

493.25 498.76 A: so i have no idea how long i'll probably be dead before it ever hits six dollars 

498.61 507.30 B: right and even if that amount were the amount they were going to pocket it would be minimal but consider the amount that they're going to lose fr- to taxes 

498.92 499.70 A: so 

503.57 504.30 A: (( mm mhm )) 

506.52 515.44 A: that's right well in in my whole working life i've been paying in so that when my time comes i'll get social security 

507.89 508.84 B: (( [mn] )) 

515.35 527.83 A: well i've already paid taxes on that but when they start sending the social security ta- the checks it's taxed again so no i'm not it's it's very sad so if you don't have 

522.34 523.95 B: you're kidding me 

526.52 533.70 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] well save some for me i got a few years okay [laughter] i'm watching my four o. one k. dwindle and i'm wondering 

529.37 530.58 A: [laughter] oh 

532.75 534.54 A: well well 

533.77 538.44 B: whether i i will get you know any nickels and dimes out of [laughter] social security 

537.71 551.90 A: at the at the interest rates now probably not and that br- that brings up the point again about these the people who are trying to make a go of it whether college or high school or whatever on five dollars and fifteen cents 

551.78 555.43 A: surely their their tips must be taxed also 

555.76 558.43 B: yes you're supposed to report your tip income 

558.24 560.18 A: i wonder how many of them do 

558.98 561.18 B: [mn] but a lot of people don't 

560.62 561.55 A: mm 

561.74 564.92 A: well unless they're paid you know by check 

563.73 568.83 B: i think i tended to round down as opposed to up when i [laughter] reported mine 

568.41 579.20 A: [laughter] oh well um i heard another story the other night that congress was thinking about um doing away with pennies and i thought oh that's nice that will give all the businessmen 

579.41 587.32 A: the ability to r- you know they won't round it to the lowest they'll round it so you know round it to the highest so 

583.21 584.63 B: right 

588.06 589.81 A: in no matter how you 

588.83 592.85 B: so what are we going to do with all these pennies they're just going to get turned into the banks and then 

592.04 594.82 A: ah [mn] i guess they're just going to do 

593.82 595.18 B: disappear [laughter] 

595.01 599.89 A: and i thought well the actually it already is crazy if they take them
