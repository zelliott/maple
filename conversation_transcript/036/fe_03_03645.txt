22.55 26.08 A: oh okay what you think about the minimum wage 

22.82 23.89 B: (( all righty )) 

25.51 34.25 B: uh i was when they first mentioned the minimum wage i was oops i don't even know what it is but then she said it increased to five fifteen is that what she said 

33.56 37.98 A: i if it'd be five fifteen or five fifty i have no idea 

36.92 41.87 B: i thought it was five fifty but anyway i it i think it's pretty low 

39.51 40.74 A: yeah 

42.00 48.32 A: i agree with you i think they should raise it so more and more uh refugees can work in mcdonald's etc 

42.75 43.58 B: [laughter] 

48.01 56.67 B: i mean i think that i mean when i had minimum wage it was three thirty five and it was that a long long time 

56.77 58.43 A: yeah 

56.89 61.77 B: and then i think it finally had gone up to four but i can't believe it's still in the fives 

62.46 74.56 A: i have not i haven't the last time i remember working minimum wage was i think it was a dollar thirty or s- dollar fifty five or something i don't [laughter] i haven't thought of that for years 

70.72 71.79 B: uh-huh 

74.84 77.98 A: and uh no i'm a firm believe that uh 

77.00 83.24 B: [noise] just seems unbelievable that it could be that i don't know how anybody could survive on that 

83.08 86.40 A: that's the problem people can't that's why they should raise it 

86.21 93.68 B: i mean but i don't know if a lot of the if the lot of the establishments actually [noise] pay that or do they pay more 

93.89 106.00 A: uh they pay the minimum wage a lot of 'em a lot the service industries like i i guess you're acting at mcdonald's and your and your seven elevens etc etc uh 

96.07 97.29 B: oh boy 

100.96 102.36 B: right 

104.96 112.58 B: i know at one point when i was in between jobs i just worked at a daycare center and it was ridiculous how low they pay you to take care of uh 

112.87 113.91 A: yeah that's 

112.91 114.85 B: other people's lives 

114.73 117.61 A: it seems like the more important the job 

117.66 118.74 A: uh 

118.92 127.04 A: i don't mean like a lawyer or a doctor but you know something more important where you're taking care of somebody else's health is the pay the least 

127.01 128.22 B: right 

127.13 132.14 A: they get people in in in you know uh nursing homes etc 

131.79 133.03 B: right 

132.24 142.46 A: and and they they get the lowest i won't say the lowest common denominator but people who will work for very little and work for basically the minimum wage 

142.11 143.18 B: right 

142.72 147.16 A: and you can say well how do these people survive well they have to work two or three jobs 

148.28 155.12 A: that's that's the problem w- we we have a business down here and uh we don't pay minimum wage 

155.98 159.22 A: and we have a lot of people could be on minimum 

156.10 156.73 B: y- 

159.26 161.98 B: right and you live in miami now 

162.64 165.16 A: (( wage w- hold on one second [noise] )) 

165.48 166.41 A: what 

166.51 169.57 B: i'm sorry are you li- you live in miami now 

168.92 170.97 A: yes i do yes i do 

171.98 173.61 A: and near aventura 

173.58 177.75 B: so you're saying that there they they don't pay the minimum wage 

177.54 181.04 A: well y- the some pla- most of the places do 

178.51 180.68 B: [noise] [noise] 

181.24 182.52 B: i'm sorry i 

181.66 186.06 A: uh most of the the uh service industries like mcdonald's 

185.51 186.53 B: uh-huh 

186.24 193.67 A: etc they do pay minimum you have to pay minimum wage unless you're don't do interstate tr- uh commerce 

187.43 188.43 B: uh-huh 

193.32 194.38 B: right 

194.04 196.38 A: and then i presume you can pay less 

197.07 198.72 A: but uh 

198.79 204.21 A: you know what it's the old saying you pay for what you get if they paid a little mo- 

203.06 205.31 B: yeah that's it that's it 

205.47 217.52 B: you're not gonna obviously keep many good employees at that wage you're gonna spend more time training over and over again so maybe if they increased the minimum wage it wouldn't be so much money wasted in the long run 

209.03 210.19 A: (( no 'cause w- )) 

217.40 219.26 A: you're absolutely right but i 

218.43 223.54 B: 'cause you know how many times do you go into a store that they you know no one knows what they're doing because they're all new 

223.63 231.07 A: you're right you're right and then they finally train somebody but what they are they're training grounds for people who worked [laughter] for somebody else 

228.51 230.41 B: yeah 

230.91 232.46 B: right 

231.68 236.85 A: and uh you know what maybe some one day business'll wake up i 

237.77 239.07 A: mean because 

238.16 239.35 B: maybe 

239.37 242.63 A: i don't know but where in new york are you uh do you live

435.68 437.05 B: exempt all what 

436.78 440.36 A: all the retired people should be paid a minimum wage at least 

437.60 440.65 B: (( [laughter] )) 

440.85 451.85 B: well so funny because if you know you go to these stores and there's always discounts for the senior citizen and some kind of student but there's never the discount for like me middle age with two young kids

452.22 459.82 A: who could really use it hey i had the i grew up and i had the same thing except but i was growing up they never had it for students 

460.48 469.46 A: they never had it for students they had it for senior citizens but nobody you know uh you're putting two kids through school or whatever it is 

463.29 471.58 B: right [noise] they must know i'm on the phone they have to start screaming when i'm on the phone 

471.43 475.26 A: well that's normal that's all right it's good how old are your children 

474.86 476.82 B: uh two and four 

476.41 477.93 A: uh they're babies 

478.41 479.65 A: both boys 

479.42 481.79 B: no one boy and one girl 

481.24 483.06 A: oh isn't that nice 

483.08 486.79 A: i was just up jacksonville visiting my granddaughters 

487.20 488.22 B: (( ooh )) 

487.31 489.54 A: one's two and one's 

488.97 490.06 B: right 

490.23 491.85 A: about four months 

492.80 495.66 B: i don't know do they listen in on hasn't it been ten minutes 

494.69 497.15 A: yeah they do they they i believe they do 

497.79 500.62 B: maybe they want us to go back and talk more about [laughter] 

499.95 503.28 A: okay well what else d'you want to add about minimum wage 

502.02 513.04 B: uh i there's nothing else really to add except that it's ridiculously low and i don't know if it hasn't gone up with the rate of inflation that's for sure i'm sure it hasn't i don't know how they base it on 

515.01 516.10 B: i don't know 

515.18 524.98 A: by i th- the political thing uh it's done for political purposes only and i think if if employers needed uh 

526.02 527.73 A: more workers 

528.05 529.39 A: they would pay 

529.50 544.50 A: better than the minimum wage but they needed a hi- higher skilled worker they're gonna pay more money but you have like all these service jobs which do not need basically a skilled worker to sell movie tickets or to uh 

535.47 536.68 B: right 

544.83 558.45 A: uh i should say take orders for movie tickets or or take an order for a hamburger or a cheeseburger or or anything like that and no and could pro- in fried chicken uh you 

550.33 551.34 B: right 

558.56 569.88 A: you'll get you know most a lot of your unskilled workers or or your minimum wage workers i would presume are uh students you know high school students 

569.15 570.15 B: right 

570.38 580.68 A: and you know it's a it's a good way of getting them into the workforce or learning it as a learning experience and saying boy i don't wanna grow up doing this all my life let me go to 

581.27 582.78 A: medical school or 

581.87 584.95 B: yeah i guess that's the only way you can look at being beneficial 

584.76 586.86 A: (( yeah i mean you say well i don't wanna do )) 

585.65 592.30 B: that that that's the positive part of it 'cause if you pay people too much then they'll just get comfortable with it and they won't better themselves [laughter] 

592.09 599.89 A: that's true well i think with this nine elevens you know with with the terrorist activities etc you're gonna find you're not gonna have so many uh 

596.79 597.85 B: right
