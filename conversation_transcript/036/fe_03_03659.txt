28.72 29.78 B: (( oh yeah )) 

32.24 41.05 A: in the elementary school uh are wage uh low wage earners and i just feel like it needs to be uh increased a lot more to me it should be [laughter] uh 

41.45 44.12 A: several more dollars more for those people 

44.27 46.68 B: really so you teach public school 

44.95 45.79 A: yeah 

46.38 48.63 A: i teach in public school right 

48.01 49.14 B: (( oh okay )) 

49.51 50.55 B: well i mean 

50.83 52.27 A: what do you sell 

51.11 51.94 B: in co- 

52.14 57.95 B: well i mean clearly in new york nobody gets paid minimum wage a- anyway everybody gets paid 

58.07 64.02 B: bumped up according to cost of living and i don't think there's anybody i've ever met that's making five fifteen an hour and 

59.93 60.77 A: yes 

62.90 65.16 A: no and even in california 

65.15 70.30 A: uh but there is people in either rural areas there's people here in atlanta 

70.16 73.60 A: uh they're trying to raise their families off a minimum wage 

73.37 84.81 A: and i've got this uh people that are working two and three jobs minimum wage jobs they're and i think it needs to be up because they're not being able to spend time with their families uh children 

84.57 92.86 A: and it in essence they're the family structure is is suffering from the fact that the minimum wage is so low 

92.59 98.10 B: they have to pay so much yeah i i guess i agree with you but at the same time i mean you know 

98.30 99.22 B: what 

99.32 103.81 B: what does it cost you i- if you raise the minimum wage say to seven bucks an hour 

102.04 109.72 A: well i think it probably wouldn't cost us that much uh i think the big businesses would just have to take less profits 'cause i think 

108.84 123.05 B: hey what about what about you know i mean then then you start having minimum wage like products getting exported from other countries where there's no minimum wage like america has to be competitive in terms of being able to employ low level wage employees 

123.02 123.96 A: well i 

123.15 124.14 B: (( you know your )) 

124.21 128.53 B: ten gazillion like electronics parts being made in china because they're paying people 

128.68 130.58 B: fifty cents an hour to do it 

130.37 134.76 A: that's right but then they don't have the standard a living we have here 

130.61 131.47 B: (( you know )) 

134.77 136.97 B: that's true but i mean 

135.54 136.77 A: they do not 

137.16 137.88 B: sh- 

138.08 143.63 B: and shouldn't there be like a worldwide minimum wage wouldn't that solve the problem more 

141.85 142.67 A: (( um )) 

143.19 156.07 A: i don't think it will ever get like that that third world compan- countries would never go like that that's why the big companies are going overseas because they can get the cheap labor it's almost like a catch twenty two 

155.90 165.26 A: uh situation but why should we penalize people that do not have the education a good education and we always need 

164.40 166.97 B: yeah but why why don't they have the education 

166.52 177.48 A: well but who is going to do those jobs if you know there is um like teaching in public school there's just so many children that are just not college material 

177.34 187.09 A: and but who would so let's say everybody was college material who's going to do the jobs who's going to work at mcdonald's who's going to do all the minimum wage jobs either 

186.21 189.18 B: yeah high school students in their spare time i mean 

188.80 193.65 A: but can't they don't h- the high school students do not have uh 

193.73 199.32 A: the know how to do that you need some older adults sometimes 

198.37 204.39 B: uh well i mean you need older adults to manage them but i'm sure a high school student can work like a mcdonald's cash 

201.24 202.39 A: you need a 

203.83 212.91 A: i don't think so i'm against high school students working too so they don't need to be working so that's why you don't ne- you need to have a higher uh 

213.07 215.65 A: hourly wage so you can 

216.09 222.74 A: you can up the if not the why is it fair for you and i making a good salary 

222.76 236.93 A: why is that fair and someone else that works even harder than us y- uh ha- has what's is under more stress probably than you and i are why should they be penalized just because they didn't go to college 

234.13 235.32 B: hey well i mean 

235.24 239.35 B: first of all i'm i'm not making good salary but 

238.42 239.38 A: yeah 

239.27 253.47 B: i mean i'm making like ten dollars for the phone call but i mean i i i'm a writer right so like i don't make you know if if you break my work down into like hourly wage per amount i'm paid it's less than minimum wage you know 

241.91 243.54 A: right [laughter] 

248.65 249.64 A: right 

251.81 257.36 A: [laughter] but that's probably so and i'm a teacher i'm a public elementary school teacher 

257.21 264.91 A: so if you break mine down i was i put in too [laughter] it's not that very good either so i guess that's why i got compassion 

260.40 261.09 B: (( hey )) 

264.75 277.86 A: for people uh that uh is trying to live off a minimum wage i see it every day families that i got their children that i'm trying to teach and i see what they're how they're struggling 

277.86 286.93 B: i mean but don't ge- i mean also with minimum wage work increase don't you think more companies would be slipping in employees under the books more companies would be you know i mean 

287.17 288.16 B: they're 

288.27 297.31 B: i agree on principle that probably minimum wage should be higher but at the same time i feel like that you know th- there's definitely drawbacks to raising it 

289.71 290.59 A: right 

296.88 310.41 A: yeah but the whole thing is maybe somebody's got to tell these big companies you got to take less profits 'cause these companies are making huge amounts of money they may not say they're making a lot of amounts of money but they are 

310.61 313.13 A: they're making huge amounts of money 

312.42 316.91 B: well of course i mean that's what they're in it for but but you know uh i 

314.43 315.43 A: yeah 

317.30 329.49 B: i mean i don't know i i think it's too simplistic to say oh you have to raise minimum wage you have to like these companies should take less profit they're gonna go and farm out there you know employing to mexico or to canada 

328.41 339.58 A: well that well that is true but then there would be a lot of minimum wage jobs that they can't farm out that they are in service industries so they do have to have the people right there on the spot 

339.34 343.72 A: doing it and even if you're a high school student or you're a college student 

343.55 357.31 A: i feel like you deserve more than five dollars an hour because that work is hard i would not work i would not do what i see some of the minimum wage jobs that they're paying i would not do it i would not work for that 

357.33 366.35 B: right no i mean i agree but like for me you know i've waitered in new york it's like you do that you don't you don't get paid a salary you just get tips 

362.13 364.60 A: yeah but that's yeah 

365.92 367.83 A: tips and everything yes 

366.45 367.37 B: you know 

367.95 369.53 B: you know and in in 

368.15 377.34 A: but they're getting very selective a lot of the restaurants are getting very selective over who they hire for waiters and waitresses at good restaurants and stuff 

374.73 375.72 B: oh sure 

377.03 384.03 B: no no i i agree but i'm saying like there are so many employees paid off the books in new york that's it it's almost like 

382.50 383.27 A: yeah 

384.04 389.37 B: you know irregardless of what minimum wage is nobody works for minimum wage you know our i guess 

386.18 387.64 A: yeah well 

387.79 391.83 A: well hearing this you must be from originally up north right 

391.65 394.07 B: no i'm i'm from north carolina but 

392.96 394.91 A: are you from north carolina 

394.54 395.43 B: yeah 

394.95 402.59 A: i just wondered if y- well usually they pay less in the south than they do you know like up north out california somewhere like that 

399.35 400.56 B: (( right right )) 

402.43 412.34 A: and so i just feel like 'cause uh even in florida i know they're having such a hard time getting workers for minimum wage down around orlando and all the places in florida 

412.13 418.93 A: tourists there they're paying seven eight dollars an hour for someone just to work at a mcdonald's or hardee's or whatever 

418.66 430.08 B: right right well i mean that's all pa- i mean supply meets demand you know if there's a ton of workers out there who are all looking for jobs then they're gonna be willing to work for five twenty five an hour you know and so 

419.30 420.76 A: th- they're trying 

428.96 442.06 A: i just guess i feel sorry for the individuals because they have not had the opportunities that maybe you and i had had in life so they could go ahead and get their education 

441.97 447.76 B: but i mean with even with a high school diploma can't you get jobs that are above wi- minimum wage 

447.06 459.00 A: not nowadays not nowadays i don't think so not nowadays you're almost it's very very hard to get um a job nowadays uh 

449.22 450.99 B: y- you don't think i mean 

459.13 461.24 A: unless you've got college 

461.25 466.05 A: and so a lot of companies don't even look at you with a high school diploma anymore 

466.60 470.34 B: but i mean well i mean we're talking like big companies 

468.01 472.53 A: unless you've got unless you're you are ex- unless you've got a trade 

472.59 484.39 A: unless you you got to just have high school diploma now is nothing in this day in time it is nothing it's just you know so you know when you go on a job interview it's nothing 

472.61 473.39 B: right 

484.48 494.61 B: right but i'm saying i mean how many i mean families like the families of your uh of your students are th- they're working these jobs for like five ten years and they're on minimum wage all the time they have to be getting 

484.58 485.76 A: right 

492.92 503.63 A: yes yeah well you know they're they're they well then you know they have limited resources and stuff usually when you're in minimum wage jobs the companies don't promote you that much 

494.65 497.16 B: raises you know they have to be getting something 

503.42 504.38 B: right 

504.06 517.52 A: and th- there's not that much promotion uh because what's gonna happen they do have promotions uh it's gonna be a college [laughter] graduate that's gonna come there and they're going to get the job so you're stuck in that low 

513.65 514.58 B: right 

517.45 527.15 A: wage job and i just feel like those people should make more money they should not be penalized because they do not have their education 

527.20 528.48 A: and stuff 

528.62 538.78 B: but i mean and what's the incentive to getting the education if you're just gonna you know if you get out of college you're gonna get an eight dollar an hour job and or if you're working minimum wage you get an eight dollar job so 

537.38 545.01 A: i don't know anybody that's gotten outta college r- recently that works an eight dollar job eight dollar an hour job i don't know anybody 

542.52 543.68 B: [laughter] 

544.03 549.45 B: well i mean i i work less than an eight dollar an hour job but i'm doing what i want right 

547.73 560.34 A: but you ha- but i don't know of any college graduate now that's gotten out of uh you know anybody that i know there may be college graduates but of all the circle of people that i'm familiar with 

560.31 564.61 A: they wouldn't even touch a a working in a eight dollar job 

564.47 565.45 B: right 

565.05 579.79 A: and so maybe you know i'm just in a different um circle group but almost all the people i know that have graduated from college kids that i have taught and stuff that have graduated outta college they're coming out and making starting off thirty forty thousand dollars a year 

580.22 581.15 B: right 

580.55 582.42 A: easily you know 

582.46 585.53 A: easily that's just easily i 

584.44 587.08 B: yeah but i mean how many hours do they work 

585.54 592.39 A: got a nephew that he just got outta college five years ago and he's already making eighty thousand a year 

592.30 593.40 B: right 

592.46 593.34 A: you know 

593.38 595.20 A: and but you know 

595.21 597.79 A: so why and i'm glad 

596.80 598.79 B: but i mean i i don't 

598.82 599.89 B: you know
