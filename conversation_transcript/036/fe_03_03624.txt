167.57 168.93 B: mhm 

169.56 178.78 A: you're gonna work for it [laughter] you're not gonna slack you know because i won't put up with it there's there's there's a hundred guys behind you that'll take your job in a heartbeat 

170.69 172.51 B: right right 

178.21 181.16 B: but if you do the job well then you'll get rewarded for it 

180.48 183.30 A: well it that's it and and we 

183.31 187.66 A: like in uh but in quebec there's july first was the moving day

193.66 194.58 B: wow 

194.42 209.06 A: so for two weeks it was just total nuts so i told the guys i said you make it through the period you make it through the rush it's long you're gonna be putting in twenty four hour days you know and getting uh maybe four hours sleep and you're back at it again but at the end of it 

202.26 203.33 B: uh-huh 

209.22 211.36 A: i split ten percent of the profits 

211.17 213.50 B: the and that that makes th- 

212.22 215.72 A: that's anywhere from five hundred to a thousand dollars at the end of 

215.14 222.51 B: and that can make an employee think wow you know not only am i getting paid i'm i'm i'm working with someone who who actually cares you know 

221.69 228.43 A: that yeah always been my attitude you work with i wo- like see i work with someone i'll never work for someone 

227.98 230.51 B: right and that's a great that's a great philosophy actually 

229.73 235.27 A: yeah but it's hard at minimum salary you know i did janitorial work at at at the airport 

234.68 235.87 B: (( mhm )) 

235.57 237.41 A: for minimum salary 

237.77 243.43 A: but i had to clear se- security i had to get sec- uh clearance i had to be bonded 

241.46 242.37 B: mhm 

243.97 246.81 A: and all the best they could do was give me minimum [laughter] 

246.06 252.27 B: right and you you sit back and you go man i am doing some important work here and i'm just not getting rewarded for it 

251.41 259.62 A: well this is it you know cleaning the washrooms after people've been on that airplane is not a pleasant job [laughter] you know [laughter] 

254.58 256.62 B: right [laughter] ri- 

256.73 263.67 B: no no there has to be some other reason for doing it there there's certainly no satisfaction just for doing the job itself 

263.13 267.03 A: exactly and uh the thing is is what happens is 

267.22 272.58 A: like some jobs you really can't i mean it's hard you know how do you pay ten dollars an hour for a floor sweeper 

272.19 273.63 B: mhm 

272.94 273.89 A: you know 

274.20 275.45 A: uh [sigh] 

275.62 281.82 A: i've always that's been a big dilemma with me because i turn around and it's well there's gotta be a way that i could make it more 

282.84 285.85 A: you know without costing me because you know you have overhead 

285.80 287.04 B: right right 

286.14 288.74 A: you gotta keep everything in check too because you know 

287.84 292.04 B: that that's the trick how do you run the business keep get get good employees 

291.68 292.86 A: yeah 

292.21 296.30 B: but yeah keep the business afloat and what you wanna pay them is the right amount you know 

295.60 305.36 A: exactly and i've read an article about that and i liked uh when he says that uh the the the top guy should not receive more than ten times the lowest paid guy 

305.82 307.02 B: oh i like that 

306.40 309.76 A: how many c._e._o.s do you know will work for fifty bucks an hour 

309.21 312.21 B: (( [laughter] right right )) 

310.01 315.44 A: [laughter] i would i i'd be happy to take it 

314.85 316.22 B: no doubt 

315.66 318.53 A: knowing that everybody else is getting a fair shake 

318.26 322.22 B: right that's the thing if if if if uh if the playing field is level 

322.03 333.66 A: it's not a problem it's just dis- dis- dis- distortion you know like you know the c._e._o.s making what oh my god with all bonuses and everything sometimes two three five million dollars 

323.57 324.49 B: right 

330.92 331.96 B: i know 

333.04 343.23 B: there was one thing on t._v. it was i think two weeks ago they showed a list of the top c._e._o.s in america and and one of 'em was one of the guys who was indicted for uh for fraud last year and he still make seventy million dollars 

342.65 343.99 A: [laughter] yeah 

343.57 345.66 B: and and and seventy million 

344.66 347.86 A: well it's not see i don't begrudge somebody making the money 

347.60 349.45 B: it's not the money but i- i- 

348.46 351.06 A: it's when i turn around and i says okay 

351.20 358.71 A: now who was er his employees and and then often you find out there's a lot of five six maybe seven dollar an hour jobs 

353.21 354.06 B: right 

358.22 359.57 B: mhm 

358.99 362.44 A: or two hundred dollars a week but they have to work sixty hours 

362.22 363.47 B: right 

362.85 366.15 A: you know which [laughter] breaks down to close to the same thing 

366.32 371.25 A: and and you're going that's where you made your money off the back of the people what the 

368.97 370.50 B: (( and h- h- h- didn't do it )) 

370.54 372.94 B: himself he had a lot of people helping him out 

373.00 380.99 A: heck that's it that's it you know you you won't you know uh except for uh what's his name there uh the g._m. the one who took not uh took over chrysler there 

373.33 374.22 B: yeah 

381.20 382.73 A: (( uh iacotta )) 

382.12 383.52 B: oh lee iacoca 

383.19 386.89 A: yeah he went right down on the assembly line and got right in there with the guys 

383.60 384.46 B: uh-huh 

386.31 387.90 B: right right 

387.28 389.90 A: but he but he turned the company around 

389.32 397.35 B: and and in the public eye he was pretty well respected for a while you know took over a company that was ready to die and then resurrected it really mhm 

392.12 394.50 A: oh yeah oh yeah 

396.64 399.97 A: yeah oh yeah i took my hat off to him on there you know [lipsmack] 

400.95 408.73 A: but you know like these other workers you know they're making what uh anywhere from seventeen to twenty six to thirty dollars an hour 

408.14 409.02 B: (( right a- )) 

409.21 413.40 A: now i don't have a problem with the c._e._o. making [laughter] 

412.71 414.64 B: as long as yeah as long as it's 

413.54 416.89 A: you know dollars a year because everybody else is making money too 

416.28 423.72 B: as long as the c._e._o. is respecting you know what the union says and what the workers deserve and the insurance is good you know it th- that makes sense to me 

421.63 422.76 A: yeah 

423.07 427.13 A: but but sometimes what happens is uh like i'm against unions 

426.82 427.68 B: uh-huh 

427.24 432.61 A: for the reason that uh they become uh so- an imbalance on the other side 

432.01 434.36 B: they may get they may get too powerful 

434.38 435.62 B: in the other way 

434.46 439.45 A: the thing is they they they they uh excuse the terminology but they screw the business 

438.99 439.88 B: uh-huh 

439.98 443.47 A: and and i've seen unions literally close businesses 

443.56 454.81 B: uh i'm wondering do- it- it's not uh [sigh] have you ever had it where you have a a a union that that is like the responsibility for the company not working the union were a little more flexible the company would do better 

455.09 459.56 A: oh yeah well i w- i was working at a place that i i was uh 

459.61 470.65 A: i was forced to be a union member and i didn't have a choice in the matter which i think is just i don't know i was just i was just flabbergasted by that i felt it was something that should be of choice 

461.24 462.37 B: mhm 

467.27 468.19 B: (( got you )) 

470.62 473.29 B: w- right if you're doing the job you should choose what you want 

472.33 480.40 A: well i wanted to get management i wanted to be promoted up to management couldn't be promoted up to management if you're in the union but you couldn't get the job without being in the union 

475.16 476.64 B: uh okay 

477.81 478.80 B: gotcha 

480.00 480.94 B: gotcha 

480.71 483.92 A: [laughter] wow what a catch twenty two [laughter] 

483.13 484.74 B: right right [laughter] you're stuck 

483.75 497.21 A: [laughter] yeah i just thought the only other way around this is to marry into the family [laughter] and i don't like his daughters [laughter] [laughter] no so uh anyways uh no i was 

489.42 493.25 B: [laughter] was that gonna happen p- probably not huh 

497.10 500.26 A: i was right great friends with the with the owner 

499.95 500.85 B: uh-huh 

500.50 509.69 A: and uh i was showing him ways to to to because i was working one end of the shop to the other so i was seeing all the the things that needed improving 

505.87 506.97 B: mhm 

509.96 522.16 A: streamline save money cut back on costs that's the you know uh s- spread a little bit to the employees you know spread a little bit to your uh family and shareholders you know and everybody walks away happy 

512.51 513.33 B: right 

519.47 520.64 B: right right 

521.74 523.10 B: right 

522.79 530.16 A: and uh you know dropped the cost down for the customer a bit and hey you know you're ahead of the game and he loved my attitude 

527.83 535.10 B: right if you c- c- that's the basic uh the core principle if you can do something that that the other guy's doing but you can do it more cheaply 

534.76 538.09 A: yeah and and still push up the quality 

535.18 536.75 B: it's to your advantage right 

537.51 540.89 B: right right without without without cutting back on quality 

538.29 539.17 A: you know 

540.31 548.96 A: exactly so anyways he he loved me but the union made it just like a misery for me a nightmare yeah they they they blocked me every which way 

545.38 546.47 B: really 

549.03 554.39 B: th- like these things that you tried to do you couldn't do because it wasn't like approved by the union or 

553.50 561.06 A: exactly exactly there was a jealousy going on you know they're going oh brown noser and i said no i'm not a brown noser i wanna keep this job [laughter] 

559.83 562.76 B: [laughter] ri- [laughter] i like what i do uh-huh 

561.85 573.71 A: yeah well i liked the idea of making nine bucks an hour thank you very much [laughter] and i would like to raise that to ten well the same with me well damn if you can't make the company money they can't give you a pay increase 

565.17 566.59 B: uh-huh 

568.10 568.85 B: and is 

572.68 576.71 B: that right and the union dues were expensive was it an expensive union to be a part of 

576.91 580.63 A: oh i thought one once one penny would have been too much 

580.09 583.53 B: rea- oh well that's that's an interesting philosophy that's good i guess uh-huh 

582.12 590.46 A: you know so i was they were just they were wanted to strike picket strike because they wanted a raise but they didn't want to push up production 

586.30 587.23 B: mhm 

588.37 589.20 B: right 

590.01 590.95 B: uh-huh 

590.90 599.95 A: okay they were stifling the guys who wanted to be productive who were on my side about let's push up production by twenty five percent then we can look at a you know fifteen or five 

597.47 598.44 B: right
