2.18 3.69 A: hi i'm nathan 

3.55 4.70 B: hi nathan 

5.37 8.07 B: well what do you think about this topic 

8.46 12.17 A: uh do you work for this company or are we two participants 

11.52 13.79 B: oh no i'm just a participant 

13.11 14.08 A: okay 

15.11 26.20 A: um u- i- it's pretty low um i mean i couldn't make that kinda money i'd be uh you know minimum wage is for high schoolers i guess 

19.90 20.76 B: uh-huh 

26.33 31.58 B: well there are a lot of people who are grown ups that are earning minimum wage too 

31.44 34.95 A: yeah i don't think you could make a living off of that 

34.99 38.70 B: well in the state i live in the state of washington 

39.07 42.80 B: and in this state the minimum wage is like seven bucks an hour 

43.50 45.83 A: so it's not a it's not a federal 

45.70 50.98 B: well the federal is the minimum but then you know the state our state has a higher one 

51.87 57.64 A: okay um i live in new york city and i i mean this is the most expensive place to live so 

56.81 59.80 B: oh no kidding yeah i used to live there myself 

59.42 60.92 A: yeah so you know i 

60.96 63.83 A: i guess i'm a a bit biased thinking you can't 

64.30 66.07 A: really survive on 

65.94 68.90 B: i can't imagine how anybody could but 

69.00 71.85 B: you know i suppose there are places where you can 

72.57 77.11 B: rent a an apartment for two hundred dollars a month so [sigh] 

77.56 80.42 B: [laughter] hard to imagine isn't it 

78.80 80.67 A: (( that yeah )) 

80.77 84.12 A: yeah i th- it all depends on where you live if it's out 

83.28 86.55 B: i think i think that's really true because um 

86.90 93.20 B: i know i know here if you know the the real estate prices are just insanely high 

93.29 96.78 B: and uh probably they're even higher in new york and 

96.93 102.47 B: uh you know on five dollars a what is it five seventy five or whatever i don't think anybody could make it 

102.72 103.98 B: i just don't 

104.20 113.39 A: yeah i mean but in general i think my political and economic philosophy is you keep a minimum wage but you shouldn't make it too high 

113.84 114.93 A: um 

115.44 118.76 A: i think kinda market drives salary a lot 

117.96 120.47 B: uh-huh that's true that's very true 

119.84 120.90 A: (( so i'm )) 

121.02 125.55 A: you know i i always agree with minimum wage increases 

125.25 126.10 B: uh-huh 

126.16 128.82 A: whenever they wanna up it you know fifty cents 

128.92 135.38 A: go for it you know i i definitely you know support that 'cause i know there's people that are you know struggling but 

136.22 140.21 B: well there's a i used to work for the computer industry 

136.52 137.37 A: (( you know it )) 

140.55 144.90 B: and in this day it's really just like taking a big dive 

144.91 148.20 B: and boeing has is like pulling out of seattle 

148.23 149.14 A: mhm 

149.09 151.26 B: and we're in this big depression 

151.79 163.21 B: so there are a lot of lot of you know computer programmers and boeing engineers that are competing for minimum wage jobs 

163.65 169.80 B: you know and there are people that have kids to support but i realize that you know if 

169.24 171.39 A: but is it gonna um 

170.07 175.59 B: if the minimum wage was raised up then the businesses wouldn't be able to hire anybody at all 

175.92 181.46 B: so you know people gotta take the jobs that are available at the rates that are being offered 

181.49 186.73 B: 'cause you know that's what there is you know but it's tough 

187.09 189.50 A: yeah i'm pretty much in agreement with 

189.62 191.43 A: with what you just said there 

191.20 193.92 B: (( yeah )) 

194.19 201.24 A: uh you know i just yeah that pretty much sums it up i guess you know i i always agree with with increases but 

202.06 205.96 A: but you know i'm more of like a laissez faire economic you 

206.27 211.09 A: know my philosophy's laissez faire let it go and you know let the market drive it but you know 

206.48 207.44 B: (( [sigh] )) 

210.17 214.35 B: well you know on the one hand i see your point and on the other hand [lipsmack] 

215.42 216.44 B: uh 

216.87 222.72 B: you know uh i i'm not working right now and i need to get a job [laughter] 

222.81 229.01 B: and uh i'm i've become disabled and my doctor says i can only work part time 

229.08 233.46 B: and i know that the only part time stuff i'm going to be able to get is minimum wage 

234.17 237.99 B: so just from a purely selfish standpoint 

238.48 243.76 B: you know i want it raised up as high as it can be because that's all i'm ever going to be able to get 

244.02 246.56 B: unless i you know start my own business or something 

247.22 248.39 A: yeah i 

249.37 259.05 A: you know we we live in total opposite ends of the country here so it's it's tough for us to you know under- well you lived in new york but i never lived in washington so 

258.51 259.33 B: uh-huh 

259.40 264.89 A: i i jus- like i know i think in new york it's like i just i think if you hammer away 

265.12 270.61 A: you know you can find a lot of different opportunities here and there and i 

269.22 270.32 B: well i'm 

270.54 271.72 B: go ahead 

271.26 281.90 A: i i think if you're very aggressive and motivated ambitious person you'll you know you could you can raise your raise your stake 

281.79 293.24 B: my my when i lived in new york you know the impression that i got was that if you can speak english you can get a job and if you have any kind of education or training at all you can get a good job 

295.99 302.75 A: yeah i'd say yeah that's true i think that's true for a for an ambitious person you know someone 

298.82 300.35 B: i mean you know if you 

301.37 303.94 B: who can present themselves well you know 

303.33 304.08 A: yeah 

304.23 308.42 B: i mean you know you have to you have to prove that but but that's 

307.43 311.75 A: yeah i mean you can always get a job cold calling and work your way up you know 

309.97 310.89 B: yeah 

312.05 319.69 B: exactly that unfortunately is not the case right now here in seattle it's it's really depressed with uh computer industry just going 

320.48 335.02 B: just like exploding and boeing pulling out it's it's really kinda bad right now [sigh] i mean uh pe- [laughter] as i say you know computer programmers and engineers are competing for minimum wage jobs 

335.13 337.71 B: but uh it's just the way it is you know 

339.16 344.22 B: [sigh] and of course the p- people that are providing the jobs these days are small businesses and if 

344.50 348.94 B: you know if the minimum w- minimum wage was raised any higher than it is now 

349.22 352.53 B: then you know they won't be able to afford it so it's 

352.84 355.59 B: you know it's tough it's tough on everybody 

354.32 365.32 A: but i but i also question that too like i- is a fifty cent an hour raise if someone works eight hours a day you give 'em four extra dollars a day 

365.67 366.75 A: (( you know that's )) 

367.58 369.28 B: well i see your point 

368.29 369.93 A: i think they can afford it 

369.80 371.67 B: yeah well 

371.76 375.92 B: i don't know you know i this is not something i've given a whole lot of thought to 

376.22 380.99 B: in fact i don't even now what the minimum wage is here i know it's seven something 

381.38 382.52 B: (( an hour )) 

382.43 386.58 A: i think here it's what they said there i think it's like five something 

386.08 388.85 B: yeah i know in the city of washington there's a higher one 

389.09 401.09 B: um but also you know [laughter] in s- well actually what am i saying in washington we have a high sales tax but then again it's not any higher than new york's new york's got a high sales tax too 

401.05 402.82 A: and they're raising it again 

402.64 403.61 B: are they 

403.47 405.57 A: yeah they just raised 

405.68 411.22 A: subway fares everything's gone up subway went up to two dollars two dollars a fare 

408.65 409.55 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

411.11 414.28 B: and that's tough on people that have to commute you know 

414.64 418.90 A: and and the commuting people are generally the working class uh that's 

418.74 421.28 B: yeah and if you've got a part time job 

421.82 424.60 B: that can eat up a lot of your money right there 

426.91 428.48 A: why you gotta learn to jump 

429.76 431.48 B: what do you mean learn to jump 

431.44 432.98 A: jump the turnstile 

433.19 435.04 B: oh [laughter] 

433.86 436.29 A: i'm i'm just kidding [laughter] 

436.66 437.63 B: (( we- [laughter] )) 

437.81 439.88 B: yeah really [laughter] 

440.64 442.00 B: oh gosh 

442.33 447.49 B: well well you know this has actually gotten me thinking i i've really gotta get gotta get a job soon 

447.97 449.88 B: i mean this is you know 

450.27 454.15 A: and there's always supplemental stuff like like what we're doing right now 

454.76 460.87 B: that's right yeah i've been doing this doing a lot of lot of what finding other ways to earn money and 

461.62 466.82 B: i think there are probably people that are earning the minimum wage and that are doing this too you know 

467.42 469.25 A: [laughter] yeah um 

469.94 475.94 A: i just thought i had nothing better to do i could i could always use an extra ten twenty thirty bucks 

475.74 480.77 B: yeah well my boyfriend who's got a good income as a salesman 

481.01 484.32 B: did it and he said it was fun and he said i should try it and it would be fun 

484.47 487.70 B: mo- mostly thinking that i needed the money you know 

487.98 489.15 B: and uh 

489.81 491.48 B: [lipsmack] the uh 

492.25 493.37 B: [sigh] 

495.17 498.88 B: i you know i- i- it's so funny to me because i was earning 

499.53 501.91 B: like twenty five dollars an hour 

502.66 504.73 B: in the computer industry 

505.02 506.33 B: and now 

506.44 508.54 B: you know the thought of earning 

509.07 511.85 B: less than a third of that is just like 

512.86 514.86 B: (( oh [sigh] i don't know )) 

514.94 517.86 B: somehow it just seems like a waste of time but 

517.94 519.61 B: i gotta do it you know 

519.65 523.40 A: yeah it can i mean i'm salary but that's probably 

524.00 524.66 A: (( m- )) 

524.69 528.75 A: probably where i'm at about twenty five dollars an hour if i break it down 

527.45 528.47 B: yeah 

528.73 529.69 B: right 

529.08 531.81 A: i couldn't imagine cutting it in a third 

531.67 532.73 B: no 

533.08 536.44 B: it's it's the well there was this um [sigh] 

536.86 540.81 B: this lady that came over to clean the house for my mother 

541.31 543.57 B: and she was a nurse 

543.88 547.41 B: but she couldn't get a job as a nurse so she was working as a house cleaner 

547.65 550.85 B: and she was just griping because 

551.04 553.01 B: you know [laughter] 

553.07 558.51 B: she w- i'm sure she was earning minimum wage i mean you i don't think you get more than that for cleaning houses 

558.59 559.80 B: (( and uh )) 

560.71 570.67 B: she was saying you know here she was she went to school to learn all this stuff and now she's just cleaning houses which she could've done if she was a high school dropout 

570.58 571.47 A: (( yeah )) 

572.12 576.50 A: well if i was cleaning houses i would definitely be doing it on my own [laughter] 

577.10 579.20 B: well yeah 

578.54 585.14 A: i would you know beat the streets try to get you know put up signs all around town trying to get business and 

585.42 589.76 B: well you know not everybody's as smart as you are or as ambitious 

589.92 594.57 A: i'm not really that smart or that ambitious [laughter] 

592.06 593.71 B: [laughter] 

595.27 599.89 A: i in theory that's what you have to do i mean you know whether i do it personally
