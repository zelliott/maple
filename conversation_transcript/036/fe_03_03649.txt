198.67 204.80 A: i told my kids when they went to move out i said you can't move out 'til you make at least this much because there's no way 

204.47 206.16 B: [mn] right or 

204.91 210.98 A: 'cause 'cause you have to have a car payment and insurance and to be able to go to work 

211.00 218.68 B: or they'd have to work two you know a part time job on top of it 'cause that's the on- that's the only way that 

214.12 215.42 A: yeah 

218.96 220.39 B: and it's 

220.63 222.13 B: unless they well

222.19 224.26 A: what what is your rent around there 

225.12 232.53 B: our rents vary greatly because it depends on what um if you're in the city or if you're in the suburbs 

232.00 233.26 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

233.03 235.02 B: so if you're in the city 

236.09 238.70 B: [mn] rents can go anywhere from 

239.62 242.23 B: the the really poor section 

242.56 247.06 B: [mn] anywhere like three fifty four hundred um 

247.57 251.31 B: up to the ritzy area you can go up to like eleven hundred 

250.51 252.24 A: [noise] sure sure 

252.18 254.76 B: um but the average 

254.02 256.51 A: so the average is going to be about six hundred 

256.00 259.77 B: it [mn] the average right the average is anywhere from um 

260.14 263.21 B: like four seventy five to six hundred 

261.74 262.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

262.42 273.11 A: [noise] yeah [noise] that's ah that's what ours is and and it must but anything that [noise] you can get for two or three bedrooms it's going to be [noise] about six hundred i mystery shop them all the time 

273.75 274.82 A: and 

273.98 277.62 B: yeah i have two bedrooms and that's about what mine is 

276.69 284.39 A: yeah so and then there's something that you can live with 'em without any bugs and you know they take care of it and stuff but 

278.07 279.15 B: and there's 

284.41 290.31 B: right but the major- the majority of the places you have to pay all your utilities 

289.42 291.77 A: [noise] yes mhm 

290.87 295.80 B: you know being in a complex that i only pay extra for my 

296.57 297.71 B: electric 

297.89 303.00 A: [noise] really well a lot of the apartment complexes now they're charging 

303.08 305.97 A: all utilities too even water 

306.12 307.46 B: oh wow 

306.98 310.74 A: around here yeah it's right on your bill now um i mean 

311.05 314.51 A: you only get your rent and you pay all your utilities 

311.18 313.98 B: well then that's that's impos- that's impossible 

314.48 317.54 B: well that's impossible to live on five fifteen an hour then 

317.50 319.69 A: [noise] right exactly 

318.54 321.81 B: there there there's no there's no way you can do it 

321.22 321.97 A: no 

323.03 326.41 B: if you've got to pay all that and child for five hundred month 

326.13 329.23 A: [noise] there's just i know it that's crazy 

329.48 335.30 A: 'cause what does that come out to in a forty hour week five dollars what is that 

334.72 336.82 B: okay well it's like two hundred 

335.69 338.73 A: ah that's two hundred dollars a week [noise] 

338.59 343.76 B: right minus taxes you're probably looking at about a hundred and thirty six dollars a week 

343.42 344.83 A: oh come on 

345.39 349.19 A: no that you're better off being [laughter] on welfare [laughter] 

347.58 354.81 B: yeah i mean that doesn't it does i mean that doesn't even cover [noise] your rent let alone any utilities or 

354.54 355.66 A: no 

355.77 357.04 B: or anything 

355.96 358.73 A: and you definitely would have to live with somebody else 

359.03 361.93 B: yeah definitely you'd have to have a room mate [mn] 

362.10 364.08 B: or s- or s- you know 

364.57 367.36 B: something like that to 

366.37 369.37 A: [noise] they wouldn't be able to afford any medical 

369.72 374.42 A: [noise] they wouldn't go to the doctors or anything because you wouldn't be able to afford it 

374.02 378.57 B: [mn] well you'd you'd have to hope that their job would include medical 

379.61 382.40 B: that you don't you'd only have to pay a small premium 

380.31 386.89 A: [noise] yeah but there's there's not too many jobs that are going to pay five dollars and something an hour that are going to 

386.92 388.61 A: include medical [mn] 

389.01 390.85 B: well you know some do 

390.89 394.21 B: they'd even if it's just like your basic little cross 

394.13 395.47 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

395.67 396.67 B: um 

397.13 400.14 B: but you'd still have to pay a premium 

399.97 402.26 A: yeah sure but 

401.39 403.13 B: you know out of that 

402.87 406.67 A: yeah you couldn't you couldn't af- afford to go [noise] to the doctor [noise] 

407.44 409.26 B: no that's 

411.88 414.14 B: yeah they definitely the 

414.18 418.20 B: the whole country definitely needs to revamp 

418.51 420.48 B: their minimum wage system 

420.57 422.26 A: (( what what is it right now )) 

420.62 421.76 B: and up 

422.47 423.57 B: it's 

424.11 428.52 B: it well i guess it's five fifteen five and a quarter or something 

429.02 430.95 A: and they want to take it to 

432.98 440.14 A: well they're asking it oh okay it's five fifteen right now so so they're wanting to know what we think would be reasonable to take it too 

441.84 447.25 B: well i would say at least six dollars with the way all these increases are with everything 

446.74 449.50 A: i would say more than that 

448.90 451.79 B: [mn] right but you know realistically that they 

450.73 452.77 A: yeah they can't do that 

452.40 455.14 B: with the way the recession is around in a 

454.14 455.04 A: yeah 

455.29 463.31 B: in this part of the country the north east here there's no way that they're going to go past six dollars 'cause a lot of countries a lot of companies will close 

455.57 456.52 A: i mean 

463.01 463.92 A: sure 

464.19 466.03 A: they won't be able to afford it 

465.63 467.27 B: (( [noise] )) 

467.87 471.57 B: [mn] yeah 'cause the the small companies wouldn't be able to do that 

468.28 469.03 A: (( but but )) 

472.98 478.02 A: they would have to cut back on their employees i know it's a hard thing to do 

473.00 474.16 B: raise it 

478.90 482.57 B: right that's right that's what they would do they would consolidate 

483.42 484.72 B: to make up 

484.96 487.07 B: for the increase in the income 

487.70 491.75 B: and then you'd be doing three jobs instead of two 

495.22 496.05 A: (( [laughter] [mn] mm )) 

496.35 497.82 A: (( [mn] well )) 

497.92 503.01 A: i'm glad i don't have to worry about that right now but one of these days i might have to you never know 

502.93 505.41 B: right that's that's true 

505.59 508.51 B: that's true you know i didn't think i'd be 

509.69 512.48 B: on medical leave so that's you know 

514.06 516.55 A: is that a and do you do anything on the side 

516.17 517.27 B: (( [mn] no )) 

516.81 518.70 A: you don't mystery shop or anything 

519.34 520.13 B: ah 

520.17 521.01 B: (( uh-uh )) 

520.90 521.61 A: (( no )) 

521.37 527.95 B: no in fact this is this is the first thing that i signed up with one of my girlfriends on line sent me the link 

527.61 528.88 A: oh really 

528.89 535.22 B: [cough] she sends actually sent me a link for a whole bunch of different things to get paid for the surveys 

535.27 536.64 A: [noise] oh really 

536.02 536.96 B: uh-huh 

537.05 537.84 A: oh 

537.78 548.85 B: so i so i said well i got to do something here [laughter] so i just went through the links and i just and i signed up for a few of 'em and i figured well 

541.53 542.78 A: [laughter] 

549.68 551.37 B: i can talk so 

551.68 554.63 A: (( yeah well that's no problem )) 

551.80 553.11 B: [laughter] 

554.61 560.32 B: so they they they can pay me ten bucks to talk ten minutes you know [laughter] 

558.23 560.88 A: yeah that's good [laughter] 

560.56 561.63 B: (( you know )) 

561.36 565.94 A: i i just up this morning and i'm just like oh this is weird but i'll try but 

566.22 568.32 B: i know i just got the email this morning 

568.33 571.75 B: that that said that i was going to get the phone call 

571.65 573.39 A: yeah 

573.81 574.91 A: so 

575.36 578.38 A: um i wonder how long we've been talking i didn't time 

578.96 580.16 B: i'd 

579.53 580.95 A: (( it )) 

581.46 585.61 B: yeah i think you know i think maybe we've probably got about like three minutes left 

585.08 586.55 A: [noise] do we really 

586.29 587.68 B: yeah 

587.13 589.65 A: okay um [laughter] 

590.54 593.60 B: [mn] okay so let's see 

593.82 597.27 B: well we can we can get into economics where you can't get 

598.79 599.89 B: the the children with
