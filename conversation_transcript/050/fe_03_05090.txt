0.79 3.66 B: hi my name is ruth i'm from maryland 

3.83 6.86 A: hi my name's carl i'm from missouri 

6.86 7.86 B: from where 

7.62 8.89 A: missouri 

8.28 9.81 B: oh missouri okay 

9.63 14.83 A: [lipsmack] so um i guess we're supposed to talk about airport security huh 

14.43 23.77 B: right whether the increase in security has helped uh uh the terrorists threat the problems with the planes um i 

24.07 25.77 B: think it definitely has 

26.38 34.66 A: well i do too to some extent but you know there's a lot of there's still a lot of people coming in that shouldn't be you know 

34.58 46.12 A: it's i was thinking in particular about the incident with the you heard about the truck load of mexicans coming through no passport and stuff like that but 

44.54 51.39 B: right but they were crossing the border uh from uh you know from mexico into arizona via truck 

51.29 53.74 A: [lipsmack] yeah that's true too so 

52.90 63.20 B: uh it really wasn't airport security uh i think you know they substan- obviously substantially increased the airport security 

62.94 64.77 A: yeah 

63.46 65.24 B: uh i've flown many 

65.44 66.83 B: and uh 

67.74 72.02 B: you know it's it's kind of random when you get screened uh 

72.23 75.94 B: i if might be helpful if they were screening more people 

75.66 76.67 A: uh-huh 

76.04 77.12 B: (( um )) 

77.36 83.85 B: but you're not allowed to bring any sharp instruments on onto the plane 

84.91 96.52 B: you were subject to random screening when you go through uh he security checkpoint and then you're also subject to additional random sec- screening before ou board the airplane 

96.76 98.23 A: (( [noise] right )) 

97.45 104.60 B: uh so i think it definitely has helped i think it's deterred uh you know anyone from doing anything 

104.35 112.55 A: well obviously there has considering you know all the terrorist attacks going on overseas like india saudi arabia and stuff 

112.79 119.28 A: um i don't fly myself so i it's just kind of a subject i don't other than what i hear on the news i don't really know a lot 

120.46 133.22 B: well i i do fly and uh you know not real often but a a number of times each year and i have definitely seen an increase in in the security checking 

132.25 135.15 A: (( about )) 

133.30 134.51 B: (( um )) 

134.69 139.93 B: the whole process i think has become a lot easier for passengers now they've kind of 

139.87 150.85 B: smoothed out things and gotten down the routine so if you know what to expect when you go to the airport you can usually go through rather quickly because you know to avoid certain things 

151.13 153.11 A: yeah 

151.31 152.31 B: uh 

152.33 156.66 B: and i think this has definitely you know deterred anyone from 

157.04 159.68 B: [lipsmack] bringing any weapons on to the plane 

159.39 160.40 A: uh-huh 

160.06 161.19 B: (( um )) 

161.31 172.92 B: you know also now the pilots uh some of them are going to be carrying weapons in in the cockpit so uh i don't think anyone will be trying to break into the cockpit any more 

172.37 181.40 A: no well i heard that they was um gonna allow that maybe and i think it was on the news i heard and they also was gonna put on different locks where you can 

181.44 183.95 A: get into the cockpit so 

183.39 192.54 B: right they're supposed to have the cockpits barred now so that you you can't just break in and also um on a lot of flights uh 

192.73 195.05 B: they now have um 

195.12 197.65 B: [lipsmack] air marshalls on the flights 

197.72 207.63 B: and i live near washington d._c. and all the flights going in and out of washington national airport have uh air marshalls on them 

206.95 209.25 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

208.05 215.68 B: so i think that uh you know it's a huge deterrent from anything happening in the d._c. area uh 

215.98 220.60 B: because i've you know i know that the marshalls carry guns and uh 

220.28 222.08 A: yeah 

220.93 221.95 B: (( you know )) 

222.03 224.69 B: i think it'd be foolish for anyone to try anything 

225.09 231.89 A: oh i know people that used to fly and they said you get police security with a gun and stuff like that 

231.80 244.82 A: i worked in a maintenance center in a motel and i was talking with uh he was a doctor from uh i think korea and he said it was nothing to get past security like with a gun or anything like it was hardly 

245.54 251.96 A: he fly flied regular before that they didn't hardly check you and i don't know if that's the truth or not but 

251.34 253.39 B: well i don't know i i mean 

253.81 258.04 B: you know obviously before september the eleventh the security checking was 

258.05 258.94 B: uh 

259.89 261.89 B: very minimal uh 

261.94 264.66 B: but after september eleventh uh 

265.05 266.13 B: i mean they 

266.29 267.45 B: (( they )) 

267.59 272.51 B: randomly inspect your bags uh your carry on bags they x ray everything uh they've checked my purse you kn- almost completely 

272.38 273.32 A: uh-huh 

272.68 274.98 B: (( um you know they can wa- they wand people uh )) 

275.03 286.13 B: ((  )) 

285.98 287.83 A: right 

286.16 294.19 B: ((  )) 

294.54 297.14 B: (( that people didn't recognize that the people )) 

297.32 298.20 B: (( did )) 

298.40 299.50 B: (( not belong )) 

299.71 302.17 B: (( learning how to fly commercial airlines )) 

302.20 308.46 A: yeah um that's good you know but you know you get down to like um 

308.41 321.57 A: flight school so that was part of that but you know this all boils back to that nine eleven incident and i just wondering if they crack down on pilots you know and and you know the flight schools or any of that 

320.59 324.33 B: you know i never did hear anything more about that but um 

325.17 337.01 B: i think that was a huge mistake you know that people didn't recognize that the people did not belong learning how to fly commercial airlines [laughter] 

336.37 338.78 A: right [laughter] 

337.48 342.07 B: i mean who learns to fly a commercial airline unless you're working 

342.12 348.07 B: for an a airline company and then you don't go to private flight school for that 

344.60 346.58 A: yeah 

347.88 354.88 A: mm no that's for sure and i if i'm my memory serves me correct some of 'em are learning how to 

355.14 356.06 A: (( um )) 

356.39 364.23 A: steer the plane in the air they weren't learning how to land or anything they're just wanting to know how to fly you know and 

362.79 366.33 B: right well they didn't need to know how to land they had no intention of landing 

364.50 365.87 A: [laughter] 

366.00 379.32 A: no but but fortunately none of that's went on since and maybe today you know i'm inclined to think maybe security cracking down on security has helped you know a lot 

378.73 385.49 B: oh i think it's definitely helped you know i i don't i don't think they would ever be able to pull that trick again 

385.70 387.23 B: [noise] in the air 

386.96 388.30 A: no 

387.39 395.61 B: um i mean there are plenty of other ways that they can hurt the united states but i don't think they'll ever get hold of another airliner uh 

395.62 396.60 B: because 

396.65 403.67 B: you know first of all the the passengers are very aware of what's going on and i don't think they would ever allow that to happen again 

403.73 409.79 A: no i believe if terrorists were to attack again they'd do it in a different way a different means you know 

409.35 413.52 B: a- absolutely uh you know there are plenty of other ways 

413.55 417.48 B: uh that they can attack uh i don't 

417.59 422.42 B: you know i think they've tightened up security to the point where they'll never try that again 

422.64 423.65 B: uh 

422.98 425.33 A: i i certainly hope so uh 

425.72 430.83 B: i mean it's i i feel very safe and very comfortable flying uh 

431.12 436.19 B: and uh like i said i've you know done it many many times since september eleventh 

435.04 435.95 A: uh-huh 

436.72 438.22 B: and seen 

439.45 448.93 B: actually a huge number of changes i mean at first it started out being kind of cumbersome for people to get through security and they were talking about all the long lines 

446.82 448.43 A: yeah 

448.58 450.40 A: yeah 

449.02 451.61 B: but they have really streamlined the process 

451.36 453.76 A: oh that's good 

452.53 466.02 B: yeah so if you know you know what to expect when you go to the airport you don't put any sharp instruments in your carry on bags or in your purse uh you know you don't wear or keep any metal in your pockets 

465.83 466.77 A: uh-huh 

466.47 478.37 B: um you know that would set off the alarms uh they tell you to take your shoes off unless you're wearing sneakers uh you know so the process is actually very quick uh 

478.83 479.73 B: you know 

479.00 486.47 A: yeah i guess why they ha- have you take off your shoes now th- that one guy had some explosives in his shoes or 

486.24 488.15 B: right he had a shoe bomb 

488.16 492.72 A: yeah and you know it's you you it makes you wonder you know what 

493.20 501.30 A: uh wh- what would cause a guy to wa- to wanna hurt people bad enough to kill himself too you know that's what i never could understand you know just uh 

501.24 507.65 B: well i mean it's the same with terrorists uh you know they kill themselves as well as many many other people 

507.79 509.27 B: uh but 

509.28 514.34 B: um you know they tell you to take off your shoes an- and they really 

514.52 522.53 B: well they randomly make people take off shoes but if you have shoes that are other than sneakers they tell you to go ahead and take them off because 

521.79 522.86 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

522.60 526.93 B: they most of those shoes do contain metal and they'll set off 

526.04 528.01 A: right 

526.95 529.51 B: set off the uh security alarm 

529.01 530.63 A: (( uh-huh [lipsmack] )) 

530.12 544.35 B: so uh you know but i most people i don't think find airport security to be a problem they'd much rather go through a little bit of extra work and a little bit of hassle than to ever be put in a position like the people were on september eleventh 

544.86 547.75 A: yeah so i don't know i guess i 

547.97 551.09 A: (( september eleventh the only thing is it kind of it's )) 

551.11 555.48 A: (( still to this day it's still affecting you so you know )) 

555.85 562.30 B: oh ab- absolutely i mean it's it's uh i think it affects many parts of everybody's lives 

562.52 565.01 B: uh you know from what you do to 

565.19 566.09 B: (( um )) 

566.12 568.63 B: you know how you feel about life in general 

567.91 570.83 A: it's yeah it's kinda 

570.97 578.31 A: sad you know there's more people killed in that nine eleven attack than there was when when japan attacked in uh 

580.11 583.10 A: (( attacked us during world war two you know )) 

582.79 583.71 B: uh-huh 

584.06 591.83 A: [lipsmack] it's kinda it's probably th- the worst trag- tragedy in in um united states history and uh 

592.45 599.34 A: and i think terrorists i i don't think there's any solution to to their activities you know 

599.49 599.89 B: uh
