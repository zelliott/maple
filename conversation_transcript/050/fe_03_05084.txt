1.45 4.34 A: hi katherine my name is bill heinz 

4.01 5.21 B: hi bill 

5.49 11.92 B: so this is do we think the heightened uh security at airports will help right decrease terrorism 

11.59 18.82 A: uh yes i do think it helps uh naturally i don't care for the long waits but it's better than uh 

19.11 22.52 A: ((  )) 

21.71 27.96 B: yeah i think i think that's true i sometimes wonder though because some of it is um [lipsmack] 

23.17 24.38 A: (( but you know sometimes )) 

28.07 40.03 B: [sigh] i don't know i get frustrated because i mean you know you're not allowed to profile people but at the same point i mean i i had um i had shoulder surgery and had my arm uh all wrapped up i couldn't even pick up my children 

39.74 40.69 A: (( uh and you know i'm certain you )) 

40.04 47.55 B: and they you know were asking me to take off my shoes and [laughter] do all these things and i had two babies with me and then and it's sort of like 

43.28 44.41 A: (( are you saying you uh were was )) 

45.90 47.40 A: ((  )) 

47.76 49.14 B: you know um 

49.18 53.18 B: unfortunately they can't use much commonsense 

52.80 54.24 A: (( yeah well [mn] y- yeah )) 

53.56 56.54 B: they have to just you know do every third person 

56.19 58.32 A: (( yeah of course but what i you know )) 

56.62 64.60 B: but um or whatever it is but um unfortunately i think in a way that's a great cost of you know resources so 

63.17 70.51 A: ((  )) 

70.66 74.99 A: (( be there an hour and a half early it's inconvenient but uh it's almost like when )) 

74.77 79.03 B: oh yeah yeah i couldn't use it at all 'cause i'd had two screws put in my [laughter] shoulder 

75.33 76.25 A: (( they hire )) 

77.14 78.22 A: (( security they )) 

78.77 80.11 A: (( say uh are you )) 

80.31 83.52 A: (( brain dead yes okay can you start on monday they don't )) 

83.72 93.95 A: ((  )) 

93.54 94.45 B: mhm 

93.75 100.86 A: (( wanna try and stop that but they will treat you like you are uh uh from um [lipsmack] uh a country that is at war with us )) 

100.72 111.08 A: (( when you have two children with you and your arm bandaged and they make you take your shoes off [mn] it's senseless you know just the yeah of course something like that but )) 

106.01 107.82 B: yeah yeah 

111.10 125.63 A: (( then again i don't did you hear recently about that story about the fourteen year old boy who uh had bomb )) 

116.33 117.30 B: (( mhm )) 

126.21 131.04 A: (( making materials did you hear about that on the news )) 

130.37 132.72 B: (( two mil- you have a little [laughter] )) 

131.18 135.69 A: (( they just said i think it was [lipsmack] i'm not sure i think it was east coast )) 

133.10 135.23 B: (( [laughter] that was like [sigh] i )) 

135.14 141.04 B: yeah it was it's like it's like it's like if you know like if my grandma were flying i wouldn't want her to be uh 

140.91 155.89 B: you know having to take her shoes off and i and i appreciate the safety but sometimes you wish i guess it's a question of like the a._c._l._u. are getting involved if they did try to say okay well make it seventy five percent men and twenty like we like down target women or like the elderly or 

142.77 143.91 A: (( maybe north )) 

155.14 156.17 A: (( carolina )) 

156.46 157.96 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

159.05 160.98 B: (( no where )) 

162.87 164.24 A: (( or florida )) 

164.09 166.14 B: (( did that )) 

164.26 164.83 A: (( [mn] )) 

168.72 169.57 B: (( take )) 

171.61 183.39 B: place but anyhow a fourteen year old boy got on a plane and um they randomly checked checked bags and it was in his checked bag were were the chemicals and instructions on how to make a bomb 

172.84 173.83 A: (( really )) 

178.18 179.16 A: uh-huh 

182.91 192.90 A: oh i thought you meant he was like uh uh had a bomb uh concealed i mean i virtually i guess he virtually did b- uh but it wasn't already made up 

186.20 187.30 B: well 

187.47 188.45 B: it was 

188.78 189.81 B: (( oh sorry )) 

190.17 192.29 B: well it was just strange 

192.31 197.03 B: yeah no it wasn't made up but he had all the chemicals and he had um the instructions 

193.14 194.59 A: yeah yeah 

194.65 205.32 A: yeah well i wonder where he was on his way to uh possibly he was uh in progress to uh blow something up you know yeah 

204.46 210.40 B: it's very odd though i mean that does go outside the profiler i would i would say for a fourteen year old 

208.14 213.53 A: oh of course a fourteen year old kid yeah yeah well it's certainly good 

210.49 211.82 B: [laughter] 

213.30 228.17 A: that they have the uh heightened security uh if he didn't blow up the plane naturally he w- somebody would've died someplace you know so uh you know it's like uh going to school you go through a 

223.39 224.54 B: yeah 

228.10 234.19 A: metal detector and that i am forty seven years old i graduated in nineteen seventy four 

233.96 239.81 A: and if you had metal on ya it was uh a belt buckle more or less and now you 

238.01 239.03 B: (( uh-huh )) 

239.60 251.71 A: go through uh it's it makes airport security look light you go through a metal detector and if you're wearing a jacket with a zipper on it you don't get into school you know it's crazy 

251.34 252.36 B: (( oh yeah )) 

251.48 265.65 A: and i think my go- i don't have children but i think man every time they would go to school i'd have to say uh have a great day at school and uh watch out for terrorists you know or if that guy uh 

262.65 263.65 B: (( mhm )) 

266.04 272.27 A: bumps into ya in the hallway watch out he might be carrying a rifle you know it's crazy it's nuts 

270.94 274.04 B: yeah it's changed well unfortunate- [cough] 

272.28 276.10 A: i can't even watch c._n._n. anymore you know [laughter] 

274.45 277.52 B: yeah it's depressing but it is it is hard because 

277.56 285.71 B: often though um like they've n- noticed in studies in high schools that the more you treat pre- people like criminals the more they will act like criminals 

283.24 284.25 A: (( mhm )) 

284.74 287.00 A: (( yeah i- it's uh )) 

286.12 294.26 B: so like uh for some people it's almost probably like oh well jeez they're really strict at airport let's see what if i can get through with something let's see if i can get away with something 

292.22 300.84 A: of course it's uh it's it motivates them more or less and you know that goes with just about anything certainly people that 

300.69 308.30 A: uh are in puberty naturally their hormones their uh adolescence it's 

308.15 310.88 A: pr- progressing and then they might 

310.64 324.75 A: uh be someone if you told them don't ever do drugs that might say i wonder and i don't wanna do drugs but they told me not to and you know it's like curfews be home by eleven 

320.43 322.42 B: well the more it's forbidden yeah 

324.51 335.76 A: well i'll get home at twelve if they don't like it tough you know they'll ground me and i'll be out next weekend so it is like the motivation like you said let me see what i can get away with 

327.71 328.70 B: (( yeah yeah [mn] mm )) 

335.66 344.08 A: so it's a way it's a [mn] um a way of profiling that uh backfires more or less if you 

343.58 344.59 B: yeah 

343.92 354.41 A: uh tell kids uh to go through a metal detector well they're not gonna go through the metal detector they'll shoot everybody outside the school more or less you know so 

353.31 355.93 B: [noise] or they'll figure out some way to get something in but 

355.08 362.99 A: yeah of course like columbine you know that was a nightmare and uh there was probably six eight uh 

357.28 358.42 B: yeah 

363.02 371.06 A: uh occurrences prior to columbine and they're still going on you know yeah yeah and you get you can't stop it 

366.72 368.43 B: and they're still going on yeah 

368.60 369.77 B: well just um 

370.43 372.43 B: it's yeah it's strange though because 

372.45 383.70 B: you know the airport security i also wonder about the actual measures they're taking 'cause you know what i think you know you know they say xraying xraying everyone's bags even ones that are checked we know they're kind of smart standard things 

379.73 380.67 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

383.71 396.60 B: um but i know i mean [lipsmack] you know d- like o- other things have been you know confiscated like my mother my mother is sixty six years old she accidentally she had some tweezers in her check in her carry on bag 

392.22 393.36 A: (( mhm )) 

395.90 397.41 A: yeah yeah 

396.68 402.15 B: now tell me what can you do actually do with w- a pen is more dangerous than tweezers 

401.17 404.82 A: [laughter] oh of course yeah yeah the sharper point yeah 

402.15 410.20 B: i mean [laughter] seriously a ba- it's they're like these little like they took tweezers they took all these like tiny little like toenail clippers and my husband and i we were 

410.03 417.71 B: coming back from mexico and he had a disposable razor you know like with the bl- you know with the disposable blade 

412.42 413.40 A: (( mhm )) 

415.63 416.56 A: yeah 

417.41 418.50 A: right 

417.92 427.37 B: seriously you couldn't even cut anybody you'd be like okay i'm gonna you know trim your eyebrows with it [laughter] i mean [laughter] and so we had to you know throw that away before we get on the plane 

423.15 424.89 A: oh my god 

425.91 426.87 A: yeah 

427.06 428.53 A: well yeah that that 

427.36 435.38 B: but that stuff is silly 'cause when when you think of like a pen or i mean almost anything is more dangerous than the things that they're taking 

434.83 437.23 A: yeah and you know uh 

437.27 446.47 A: i'm not a racist but uh when the uh september eleventh happened uh nine one one happened uh 

446.80 452.89 A: [mn] you know those guys that were on those planes they had razors and knives and things 

451.91 454.10 B: they had knives box cutters 

452.82 467.68 A: yeah and now your husband is getting a disposable razor confiscated like hey i was gonna run in the airpl- uh the uh bathroom in the airplane and try and shave you know it's uh crazy y- 

465.34 466.37 B: yeah 

466.73 476.60 B: you know what they should've caught the box cutters i mean that's for sure box cutters and knives i i agree should not be allowed on planes but tweezers or toenail clippers [laughter] [laughter] come on 

470.43 471.59 A: oh sure 

472.21 473.50 A: of course 

474.83 489.11 A: yeah yeah you know yeah uh i'm gonna clip the [mn] uh flight attendant's toenails and uh i'm gonna i'm gonna make her t- big toe bleed yeah i'm a terrorist yeah it's crazy 

477.63 478.42 B: [laughter] 

481.67 483.28 B: [laughter] 

486.25 487.57 B: but i think yeah i 

488.14 497.91 B: think like some of that's silly when when you realize like so much more is actually much dangerous i mean the the right trained person their bare ha- hands are more dangerous than anything so 

496.36 497.45 A: (( mhm )) 

497.25 504.11 A: well you know i don't mean uh i know you're probably a native of the united states 

503.68 504.58 B: mhm 

503.90 511.69 A: and i am uh not someone that uh is down with the u._s._a. or anything like that but i've always been under the impression 

511.47 524.89 A: that the [sigh] united states and certainly this has something to do with democracy which i approve of but we have virtually gone about everything as far as decision making and uh 

524.77 529.70 A: top notch uh priority things we've gone about everything backwards 

529.53 540.58 A: for a century uh s- over a century virtually ever since uh the revolutionary war when we became uh independent from britain 

533.77 534.64 B: mhm 

540.40 553.90 A: and then the civil war and slavery everything has been backwards and uh like the vietnam war and then now we're fighting with iraq iran about the price of uh 

548.33 549.28 B: mhm 

553.82 559.05 A: uh [sigh] a drum of oil and uh we're spending 

559.11 567.16 A: uh a million dollars a day and the war is over in iraq and we're still getting uh 

567.35 571.97 A: nineteen twenty year old kids killed by snipers in uh 

571.90 582.47 A: ir- in uh iraq and it's just senseless w- and we have homeless people sleeping in refrigerator boxes under a bridge in washington d._c. 

582.23 595.02 A: two blocks from the whitehouse [laughter] and you know all we care about well a drum of oil costs how much uh hey get that guy outta that refrigerator box out there and uh tell him to move to a different bridge 

583.96 585.20 B: yeah 

594.87 598.62 A: it's just crazy the united states uh 

598.68 599.89 A: if uh they
