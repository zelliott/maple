204.00 204.87 A: um 

209.91 217.51 B: uh because the they were pulling a lot of fiber at the time and we just didn't know we couldn't be around every place and uh 

212.77 215.39 A: (( mhm )) 

217.38 226.20 B: we asked them if they would not you know refir- -frain from pulling anything underground and and asking them to leave and they did they did

228.63 242.19 B: [noise] getting back to what you said uh you hadn't made any other changes i really hadn't either i've thought a lot about all the other people that it affected because it really did some kids never will know one parent or the other 

242.23 243.78 B: or uh 

243.46 245.25 A: (( right )) 

243.89 249.43 B: you know a lot of people i think in one neighborhood which was uh 

249.96 253.53 B: just north of one of the suru- suburbs of uh 

253.76 257.47 B: new york uh there was like uh 

259.00 270.75 B: a hundred and seventy households in this one sub- suburbian area that got hit that lost uh either one spouse or parent or the other which 

269.35 272.44 A: oh that's that's terrible 

270.76 274.54 B: was uh yeah which is i- i- it's devastating but 

275.24 280.90 B: you know chris i think we set ourselves up for it because we're such a 

280.87 290.32 B: come and go society we have a lot more uh freedoms than a lot of other people from other countries 

282.47 284.50 A: (( [noise] right )) 

290.48 298.27 B: and and we have this problem here i'm sure you have it there i am of uh mexican american descent but i was born and raised here 

297.90 299.70 A: right 

298.37 303.87 B: uh but there's a lot of people that want to live the dream that we do 

303.93 307.79 B: and we're not rich but you know live the dream that we do 

305.64 308.33 A: [noise] right but by world standards we are 

308.01 313.31 B: right oh yeah they want to come over they will die in the back of a truck to come over here 

308.93 309.86 A: um 

313.16 315.00 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

313.60 325.65 B: you know and that's that's sad you know that's that in itself is sad you know but uh we we take a lot of stuff for granted where a lot of people are literally dying to get here 

326.36 328.16 A: right 

326.47 337.81 B: and uh and and i think it was a wake up call that uh it was a horrible way that it happened we've established that but i think it was something that something that woke us up to where 

338.25 342.44 B: we should really go over our uh 

342.46 343.72 B: security 

344.04 346.27 B: you know uh even more 

346.42 347.80 B: than we do now 

347.51 361.65 A: well as a nation we are um isolated i mean all we really have to worry about is our northern border with canada and our southern border with mexico 

354.40 355.15 B: yeah 

362.08 363.18 A: um 

363.62 375.37 A: we've got oceans miles and miles of oceans on either side we're not like one of these european countries that you can just cross over on any border 

367.91 368.74 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

374.87 379.25 B: yeah well they they go through their uh different countries like we go through states 

378.83 382.50 A: [noise] right right so i- it's just it's 

379.76 380.97 B: (( you know so uh )) 

382.62 387.98 A: we have been isolated and uh no one has ever been able to 

388.30 392.45 A: no foreign national has ever been able to 

390.51 391.34 B: mhm 

392.50 394.97 A: get into our co- country and do this 

394.93 398.71 B: yeah and the funny thing about it is there was guys and people 

398.72 402.17 B: that saw this coming but they just didn't say anything 

401.59 403.30 A: yeah 

402.58 405.24 B: you know they they you know why are these guys 

405.27 410.64 B: you know i thought that a while back we've got a a small airfield which is uh uh 

412.17 423.76 B: locally owned you know by the city and and everything else but when i i went to a training class out there and i noticed all of the guys that were uh flying in the planes 

423.66 427.44 B: were of arab descent and i and i thought that was strange 

427.18 428.83 A: yeah 

427.84 431.72 B: and of course i didn't say anything about it but it just sort of hit me like 

431.75 434.05 B: there's something wrong with this picture 

434.23 436.63 B: you know why wouldn't there be the 

437.65 446.10 B: uh equal or uh uh a little bit more of a mixture of of all the nationalities that the united states has 

446.23 450.90 B: why would they not have more of an interest you know why is it just one group so 

450.56 455.08 A: [lipsmack] [noise] yeah i've i've never really noticed that but i have noticed that uh 

451.41 452.40 B: (( you know i'm )) 

455.89 460.16 A: in hospitals that you see a lot more of the of the arabs 

460.27 461.32 B: mhm 

460.79 473.09 A: um and and foreign bur- born people um i don't think we have the best educational system [noise] but i think we're one of the easier places to get into to get the education 

472.84 481.15 B: right right yeah that that's true our m- my dad went to italy about i would say now about fifteen years ago 

474.01 474.99 A: um 

480.81 481.72 A: yes sir 

480.98 492.42 B: it said it took him about four and a half hours to actually get into italy before he could actually sightsee same amount of time to get out now there's not anything that's 

488.23 489.57 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

492.47 497.12 B: you know uh overly dangerous about italy w- except what i've seen 

497.07 509.11 B: is being a beautiful country and he said it it really was but he said both coming in and out of new york it didn't take him any longer than the time that it got to him to walk from the plane 

509.10 512.84 B: through the the terminal to get into a taxi and start you know 

513.05 517.04 B: uh s- start heading home he said nobody checked anything 

513.17 514.63 A: (( hm )) 

515.18 518.53 A: i guess uh do other nations 

518.81 519.97 A: um 

522.53 525.96 A: do they profile 

525.85 528.15 B: uh i don't 

526.93 530.56 A: i mean i don't that's a that's a a buzzword now 

528.49 529.65 B: yeah 

530.44 538.75 B: sure yeah that i- that is a politically correct term i don't know if they profile i think what they do is really scrutinize 

530.94 531.80 A: um 

537.73 540.40 A: [noise] they they scrutinize everyone 

540.23 541.91 B: yes mhm 

540.59 545.07 A: where i think we pretty much just pick and choose oh we wa- w- [mn] 

545.15 547.32 A: a- at random 

546.87 548.08 B: yeah 

547.55 549.25 A: yeah 

548.39 556.91 B: yeah they i i believe that's w- that's what we do but uh you know i can't uh be a fair judge of that uh because i don't travel as much now 

555.31 557.90 A: yeah i've never been out of the country myself 

557.57 569.19 B: we travel a lot within the states and but uh not necessarily you know uh flying like a- all my kids are like from twelve to two so 

569.19 576.20 B: uh i i don't i think it sort of freaks them th- that that to want to fly anyway plus it'd be a small fortune 

573.92 575.74 A: right 

576.07 578.97 A: right oh yeah four children 

576.97 577.72 B: [laughter]
