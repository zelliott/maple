0.45 2.16 B: hello i'm becky 

2.21 7.73 A: hello becky my name is richard where do you where are you from um where are you at becky 

4.23 5.20 B: hi 

7.25 8.93 B: uh tampa florida 

8.82 15.64 A: oh my goodness that's quite a ways from here this is the northern far far northern part of michigan almost to canada 

15.01 16.37 B: oh wow 

16.38 17.54 A: um 

18.80 23.95 A: well i guess i'm not real knowledgeable about the subject today i guess we're supposed to talk for about 

23.99 31.63 A: eight minutes on uh how we feel about professional athletes uh striking so i'm 

31.67 32.70 B: (( [sigh] [noise] well )) 

31.76 34.68 A: uh kind of wondering if i can learn something from you maybe 

34.22 39.17 B: well i'll start i will say that uh my husband is active duty military 

39.18 43.01 B: and um after everything that happened on nine eleven 

39.20 40.17 A: uh-huh 

43.05 45.33 B: i felt horrified 

45.51 55.03 B: you know i- i- it put things in perspective for me as far as athletes and as well actors and actresses that make so much money and i i don't feel that they 

55.04 58.20 B: yes they have a special talent but i don't feel that they 

58.34 59.94 B: do anything to 

59.85 74.42 B: to earn the money i think uh that money would be better spent on paying people that are giving their lives for their country you know or the firefighters and policemen and military members um i'm not a big sports fan 

74.37 86.63 B: [mn] so that could also influence my thoughts on the matter and perhaps being military spouse too but i just don't i i you know i've always felt that they don't deserve that money but i guess it's 

87.03 93.88 B: driven the fans love it so i guess that that's where the money you know [laughter] the money comes from but what do you what are your thoughts 

93.89 96.61 A: [noise] uh well th- i know um 

94.00 94.68 B: (( mhm )) 

96.68 109.43 A: some professional athletes not all of them you know the minor leagues and so forth are not paid that well but uh the you know the top ones really are uh have fantastic wages 

108.99 110.08 B: mhm 

109.65 115.82 A: i i don't really have any firm opinion on it except i don't um 

116.20 117.32 A: you know i 

117.52 120.62 A: i don't know that they deserve that that uh 

121.26 125.33 A: um [sigh] you know those high salaries or not 

125.66 136.87 A: but i think uh probably you know if if one person can has a right to strike probably the other one should too so i suppose the uh 

134.33 135.42 B: yeah 

137.06 138.18 A: as far as 

138.91 142.01 A: you know them being able to strike it's 

141.95 155.93 A: um it's okay but it's kind of like to for m- for me th- my perception of it is it's like watching that television program the lives of the rich and famous you know it's just so 

149.18 150.00 B: mhm 

155.54 156.70 B: yeah 

156.26 160.67 A: so far removed from any ordinary day to day thing that i'm 

160.68 164.19 A: involved at or i am familiar with that uh 

163.04 164.60 B: (( right right yeah mhm )) 

164.44 170.35 A: it just it's just uh almost bizarre so [sigh] um 

171.13 175.39 A: i don't have any real strong feeling on their 

175.60 179.75 A: rights to strike i know i don't think all all 

180.02 186.96 A: not all professional athletes or actors are well athletes we're as we're talking about a lot of the minor league 

186.99 189.45 A: uh folks they d- they don't uh 

189.62 199.45 A: they don't they don't make real good money at all but uh th- the i i i don't think there is in as good a position to 

192.04 193.01 B: right 

199.50 201.75 A: actually um [mn] 

203.32 205.89 A: you know do a strike whereas the 

204.86 205.69 B: yeah 

206.05 209.72 A: more uh higher paid ones i mean 

209.87 210.99 A: (( the um )) 

211.16 220.54 A: the ones in the media and so forth it- it's kind of like they've got the whole world by the tail so 

215.77 217.13 B: right right 

217.25 218.75 B: [sigh] i'm not i think 

218.87 228.20 B: i don't know i i see sometimes uh you know michael jordan and the people that have made all the money um from advertising and everything else that they've done 

228.15 238.56 B: and then they then become role models which is great you know but salary wise i just look at it i guess i've got two small kids and and trying to justify 

238.53 249.96 B: you know why you know do these people that play basketball or what not you know make so much money whereas you know if you want to be a doctor or y- or probably more 

250.25 259.24 B: along those lines a- y- a- a- a police officer or a firefighter you know it's it's a hard way to make a living and yet look what you're doing you know you're still mor- such 

259.43 264.67 B: [lipsmack] more beneficial to your society not that sports aren't important for you know 

265.06 271.03 B: for [sigh] um exercise purposes and i know people love to go to sports and it brings people together and 

270.89 281.28 B: they're fun but i i i just it it really it really i've never uh been a fan of them making that much money but since everything that's been going on in the world [lipsmack] 

281.52 283.14 B: i just felt 

283.15 289.33 B: just terrible you know when when it actually occurred to me my gosh you know here are all these people that just ran into the [sigh] 

289.16 300.89 B: twin towers and lost their lives and you know they weren't hardly paid at all for that you know and [laughter] they really should be the ones i just feel that that make more money although that won't change but um 

300.89 304.99 A: [noise] [noise] i think some of it though too is a l- there's an awful lot of athletes 

305.01 308.22 A: around and uh the ones that are n- um 

308.94 316.92 A: really highly paid are really noticed a lot but there there's you know the mass of them are not really a lot of them aren't 

316.94 318.65 A: you know so 

318.88 333.81 A: i think the perception is that they're you know you know all athletes are paid millions but they're not a lot of them are of course some of them are and some of them are paid quite well some of the baseball uh people are 

324.25 326.20 B: (( mhm mm that's probably true )) 

328.99 329.99 B: yeah 

334.56 335.75 A: you know they're 

335.79 339.37 A: they're s- they're playing time as far as 

339.36 345.30 A: it's only you know it's only ten or fifteen years and when they start getting 

345.26 355.98 A: um up in years they just you know they can't compete with the younger players so probably they should be paid more you know because of that and in any sport where that would be 

352.21 353.16 B: (( mhm mhm yeah )) 

356.03 357.18 A: uh 

357.20 360.10 A: you know that would be th- similar to that 

360.14 363.01 A: there are a lot of sports like that where you just you know you 

362.99 375.17 A: uh it really is a young person's uh game and then you know they they don't stay there till they're sixty or sixty five years old and you can't compete with the younger players so 

365.10 366.61 B: game yeah [laughter] 

370.75 372.08 B: yeah that's true 

373.39 374.68 B: well that's true 

374.86 377.81 B: yeah this you know it's hard to say i guess i um 

378.07 382.37 B: being here in tampa bay we had you know the big bucks superbowl and 

381.75 383.03 A: oh 

382.38 391.80 B: that was kind of a big deal around here and so in that re- you know [mn] in that regard i'm thinking well you know i guess payment when you win the superbowl should be 

391.88 401.35 B: compensated i mean that's a big deal and i know that made them more valuable players and so i guess in that regard i can see yeah you win a tournament like that 

400.24 410.64 A: oh when y- you're you're more uh uh you realize this more 'cause you're right there in tampa bay where the the the one of the top teams is oh okay 

405.85 407.48 B: exactly 

410.11 419.81 B: yeah so i think yeah you know we get a lot of bucks fever going on around here and i'm mm y- [laughter] i'm just not a big sports fan and so it really 

411.30 412.09 A: (( uh-huh )) 

418.35 419.21 A: oh 

420.17 423.68 B: touches a nerve i guess 'cause we got a big airforce base here 

424.46 425.55 A: oh 

425.22 428.43 B: and um i'm like mm you know i don't know i 

428.48 435.69 B: mean everyone deserves to be paid you know if you're that good at a sport that's great and you should be paid for it you know and what not but i just 

435.52 444.63 B: i'm really speaking to i guess the michael jordans and the people that just get paid just obscene amounts of money but mm i don't know they're actually 

443.07 447.20 A: yeah the the the life of the rich and famous 

445.78 453.72 B: yeah but i think though really it's not it's driven by the public i mean i really believe that because the public just eats it up you know [laughter] 

453.23 459.58 A: yeah they're they're adored almost they're god like figures yeah [mn] 

454.19 455.04 B: so 

457.07 458.33 B: yeah 

458.34 466.30 B: and it's like you know why you know why should michael jordan i it's the only one i can think of it's why i keep bringing him up uh [mn] 

466.44 473.67 B: you know why should he be emulated by by your children for example what did he do you know i don't know anything about his personal 

473.81 483.97 B: biography but as far as what his job is he plays a game you know and he's made a good career for himself but as far as qualities or anything i just uh 

484.03 494.38 B: i don't know it's just 'cause he's out there and on the underwear commercials and you know out there in the public and and the public loves it and so they get the big money so mhm 

494.04 503.69 A: yeah well i think there's a real negative there that you've kind of pointed out um you know the the adoration of the top you know p- people 

503.74 513.87 A: the w- thing i think th- of when you're talking about that especially being overpaid which i think extreme overpaid is um 

512.21 513.31 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

514.48 519.02 A: top business executives it's just it's gotten to be a scandal this here 

519.39 522.87 A: and this whole culture of you know where 

523.62 535.92 A: you know they're almost feral like uh personalities that and they're entitled to millions and millions and millions and i i think it's a real negative when it carries over especially to the business culture when 

535.43 536.67 B: oh yeah 

536.06 540.11 A: people are just obscenely overpaid i believe 

539.50 540.38 B: yeah 

540.13 543.14 A: i'm i'm simply not as familiar with um 

543.54 546.81 A: i'm not as tuned in i guess either with sports figures 'cause i 

546.96 560.24 A: live in a kind of a rural area and you know we we talk about the detroit uh [sigh] teams or something like that but it's kind of a long ways away so it's not a it's not a big issue here 

554.03 555.29 B: uh-huh uh-huh [mn] 

555.79 557.60 B: (( yeah i- )) 

559.61 561.49 B: yeah yeah that'd be 

560.77 571.96 A: for for the people here you know they're they're really green bay fans because they won the you know they won so everybody there's people that drive cars with you know 

564.83 565.98 B: oh yeah 

566.77 568.61 B: uh-huh yeah [laughter] 

571.76 576.39 A: the br- green bay colors and the green bay flag you see this around 

575.15 577.95 B: oh yeah that's here you know florida has a 

578.04 592.98 B: license plate a buccaneer's license plate you can get for your car i mean and you pay for that you know you have to pay extra to have that i know it's crazy [laughter] i mean it's great to support your team and your state i suppose but again it it just seems like it's society 

579.39 581.58 A: so oh my 

586.79 588.19 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

593.31 599.89 B: i guess society as a whole can't be that offended or upset that they're making that much money because they're the ones that are eating it up and
