0.43 2.85 A: [noise] hi hi i'm kelly 

2.70 5.18 B: [lipsmack] hi i'm nate nice to meet you 

4.11 6.74 A: hi nate hi how are you how are you nate 

6.44 7.99 B: oh i'm doing good how are you 

7.60 13.09 A: great i guess our topic is how we've changed our ways since september eleventh 

13.18 14.34 B: yep 

13.71 16.51 A: okay great well you want to go first 

16.43 30.36 B: sure i'll i'll take you up on that invitation [laughter] um uh you know i don't think i've changed uh too much on a day to day basis really um i would say that i made a lot of financial changes though um 

17.94 20.02 A: okay [laughter] all right [noise] [noise] 

30.47 35.41 B: just just in terms of sort of safeguarding my myself in the uh 

35.46 43.77 B: recession that sort of was helped along by september eleventh not necessarily caused but certainly didn't help things [laughter] so 

42.41 46.12 A: right i g- i i i agree with that i think that um 

46.23 56.64 A: i think september eleventh was the timing was kind of not that there's ever a good time to have anything like that at all but i think that yeah that kind of contributed to 

52.87 54.31 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

57.03 61.93 A: somewhat of a little bit of the recession i guess especially when it comes to like um 

61.86 73.10 A: oh travel and airline and i guess just kinda the economy as a whole but i agree i mean i don't think i've changed my ways on a day to day basis either i think um 

73.10 82.08 A: [lipsmack] maybe if i had to think about it a little bit i guess i uh pay attention on the news a little more than i did before i mean i always followed the news but 

81.59 83.08 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

81.97 95.08 A: you know current events and politics and stuff but i guess i'm more more in tune to that now you know but as far as you know do i not um travel or do i not 

95.22 96.56 A: um [sigh] 

96.58 102.38 A: you know go to the mall or or what have you i haven't changed at all from that standpoint yeah [noise] [noise] 

101.60 109.30 B: yeah i imagine that most people fall into that category i actually i actually started with a with a goal to to save half my income 

109.38 113.11 B: after september eleventh and that was pretty much all i did 

112.36 113.94 A: oh really wow 

113.55 118.98 B: yeah well you know i was just out of college and i i work for a small very small company so 

118.11 119.05 A: uh-huh 

118.93 125.34 B: i you know literally weeks after september eleventh half of our business was gone so 

124.22 125.32 A: oh wow 

125.19 138.37 B: a couple of my colleagues were laid off and i was one of the lucky few [laughter] [laughter] and i didn't know how long i would be lucky for so [laughter] so i'd i sold my car i bou- and then i got i was you know a real beater 

129.68 130.94 A: yeah i 

133.03 135.41 A: [laughter] w- [noise] 

138.41 142.53 B: um and made just a variety of changes but but day to day nothing big 

140.61 141.77 A: you know when i 

141.76 156.38 A: you know and i think there's a lot of people that fall into that category too i mean i think there's a lot of people that and i think that was one of the reasons why the economy slowed down a little bit like it did was because people started saving more you know and there was less money in in the in the e- economy so 

150.77 152.15 B: yeah 

156.26 159.79 A: i don't know you know i i the other thing i think is 

159.77 171.36 A: um i definitely follow the wars [mn] you know that that have happened obviously afghanistan and iraq and i i've also i've been much more aware of um 

166.57 167.72 B: yeah 

171.41 177.82 A: how america's perceived i guess after september eleventh you know it's funny how um 

175.27 176.60 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

177.88 181.61 A: [noise] i dunno maybe it's the typical american attitude but um 

181.51 190.60 A: you know it seems like uh there's a lot of times in in the history of the world or the history of of america that a lot of countries have problems and we always went and helped them and 

190.61 202.28 A: they have an earthquake or s- you know we we send millions of dollars worth of this and million dollars of that and and then to have it actually happen to us and to see the what i would call limited support uh 

201.29 203.75 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

202.24 211.84 A: from a lot of countries is really surprising and i don't know how that changed my ways on a day to day basis but i think it changed my perception of different countries throughout the world 

211.21 214.82 B: yeah you know i think that's a great point and actually what i noticed is 

214.71 221.99 B: is the limited support coming from so called allies but actually surp- surprising amount of support coming from some countries 

217.86 218.95 A: exactly 

221.81 233.35 B: y- maybe just moral support but but a surprising amount of support coming from countries that many people would consider either enemies or sort of competitors [laughter] 

230.81 241.97 A: i i agree i agree you know a lot of the eastern former eastern bloc countries that that came you know the poland i- i- for example and so on and so forth i i don't know you know it seems like um 

235.63 237.79 B: (( [mn] [laughter] yeah )) 

241.99 255.21 A: [lipsmack] i i can tell you that [mn] one thing that has changed since the attacks is is my perception and i can tell you that i'd be hard pressed to buy a french [laughter] product any time soon or or a german product any time soon 

251.58 254.25 B: [laughter] 

255.02 261.39 B: well bu- i would i would caution though that a a lot of americans are employed in bringing those products here so 

255.09 257.20 A: uh [laughter] 

257.22 258.46 A: (( [laughter] )) 

260.58 263.56 A: yeah well and i i i agree that too 

261.22 271.50 B: you you know tha- that kind of thing could have unintended consequences for people tha- that you care about too [laughter] [laughter] like me [laughter] yes 

264.50 265.42 A: well 

265.59 276.67 A: [laughter] exactly well you know and it's a world econo- it's a world economy but you know the reality of that is um [mn] you know i think we'll do okay um [mn] 

276.82 286.71 A: being able to work with different countries that do want to be our partners in different things you know well 'cause i and i think i think it in general i think that it's in our best interests to 

281.22 283.03 B: yeah well one thing 

286.96 299.10 A: i don't want to be you know i i think it's in our best interests to be a little more proactive so you know with terrorism and so on and so forth you know i think i- and it's not only in our best interests but it's in the best interests of a lot of other people 

294.50 295.95 B: [lipsmack] well that's probably true 

299.16 303.66 A: you know and that's just my opinion [laughter] [laughter] 

301.00 302.52 B: oh well i think that's 

302.67 314.99 B: a i'd be hard pressed to disagree with that but uh [laughter] how 'bout do you think that the war in iraq is making has made us safer or has had no impact on security or has had a negative impact what's your take on that one 

304.44 306.79 A: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

313.25 313.81 A: (( [noise] )) 

313.72 325.30 A: well you know i i mean in general i think that since september eleventh and the war in afghanistan and then the the follow up with iraq and stuff i personally feel like 

325.20 329.09 A: it's created a huge amount of visibility to 

328.88 343.25 A: rogue nations that think that they can get away with a lot of things and because of that i personally feel a little bit safer i mean i think it it's you know it's kinda like i- i i you know a little bit of analogy is if you're driving down the road at 

342.67 345.56 B: (( right )) 

343.28 348.92 A: a hundred miles an hour every single day and you know that there's not a policeman there that's going to get you 

348.81 354.76 A: you're probably going to continue to do it now you're going to be put people's lives in danger by doing that yourself 

352.90 355.99 B: (( yeah )) 

354.63 359.81 A: and so on but if you go by there one day and you realize you know what there's a cop here every day 

359.68 369.82 A: odds are you're probably not going to be as apt to do that [noise] you know so i don't know just kinda a small analogy but i do feel a little safer i think that um 

362.76 363.32 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

367.68 371.94 B: (( right )) 

369.99 370.98 A: you know 

371.03 380.20 A: the efforts we've made have made hopefully [noise] i don't know in my generation uh being a i'm a gen xer i guess you'd say and uh 

378.55 380.16 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

379.97 386.13 A: i don't know if my generation will see the reap as much benefits as maybe my children or my grandchildren 

385.99 387.82 B: right 

386.14 391.55 A: [noise] 'cause i think i think we're in the [noise] beginning stages of making things better you know [noise] so [noise] i- [noise] 

390.38 405.28 B: yeah well i i think i agree with your point about rogue nations sort of feeling uh the heat a little bit more i am i am concerned though that we may not be pressing as hard with al qaeda or i- or with other islamic organizations as we could be 

404.82 418.07 A: uh you know and i agree with that i mean i think i do i think i agree with the fact that um but the thing i think that american people don't realize is there's a lot of battles that are being won right now that that our government can't tell us about 

405.52 406.50 B: but 

417.91 419.22 B: yeah 

418.39 420.54 A: you know and i mean i think that 

420.78 425.70 A: [sigh] i i agree i mean i think it to an extent um 

425.95 437.56 A: uh i- it could have iraq could've been somewhat a little bit of a detraction to september eleventh but i also think that americans have short term memory you know [laughter] you know it's like um 

433.76 436.23 B: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

436.59 438.65 B: [laughter] 

437.53 444.39 A: you know they forget about a a lot of things that happen you know so i don't know [laughter] 

441.45 448.01 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] well that's certainly true [laughter] 

445.34 455.03 A: [laughter] anyway [noise] well what else that what else has changed you i mean have you uh do you [noise] talk to your do you travel as much as you did before or 

454.07 467.67 B: um well you know my business travel really dropped off after that [laughter] and it never really got up to the point where things were before um but that wasn't that wouldn't be a personal choice i've actually done more personal flying since then just because 

457.59 458.99 A: did it really 

467.47 473.13 B: i think it's a little easier to get uh the cheap tickets even just seven days in advance now so 

472.29 483.21 A: [noise] [noise] i agree and you know how do you feel about airport security i mean i i think that it's it's actually um not as slow as people think it i- had anticipated it would be 

482.79 497.65 B: [noise] no i don't think it's bad i i like to pick my flights sort of in the morning or so or late evening when it tends to be a little quieter um but no i don't i don't it's bad i think that it wo- i think that things were rough like the first three months after they did the major changeover 

484.04 485.05 A: yeah 

489.60 490.55 A: uh-huh 

498.04 506.28 B: must've been [sigh] in january after september eleventh maybe there was a couple of months of really some bad delays but after that they got a system down 

506.03 507.16 A: right 

506.60 521.03 B: um yeah one thing i'd like to see and this is going to sound really bad but [laughter] i i think that there should be um racial profiling and interviewing as part of the a- as part of the security and it and it's not that i think that everybody 

510.50 511.78 A: [laughter] 

512.57 513.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

515.50 516.69 A: no i [noise] 

520.83 534.69 B: from other countries i- is is more likely to be a terrorist necessarily it's it's just that we're fighting an organization that is an avowed islamic organization that really only accepts muslims and therefore i don't think it's a racist thing to say that 

534.53 540.01 B: muslims should have to submit to intensive screening at airports that's just my take 

539.44 551.45 A: no and i agree with you and i i i th- uh i agree one hundred percent with that and i think that there are more americans that have that opinion uh than the press would lead you to believe 

540.32 541.79 B: but [mn] 

550.81 560.48 B: now the other thing that [laughter] the other interesting opinion i have though which may sound like it conflicts is that is that i'm really disappointed with some of these uh 

560.71 568.36 B: these um detentions of arab americans or arab immigrants here uh without access to attorneys 

567.90 569.76 A: oh well yeah i agree yeah 

568.59 581.75 B: i say i s- you know i i think that it'd be great if we had some profiling but at the same time i think it's unacceptable um that a country that sort of prides itself on the rule of law [laughter] would detain people without lawyers 

581.71 584.27 B: uh that's just i think that's a disgrace 

584.06 585.73 A: yeah i agree and 

584.58 589.41 B: you know all these people these people here in in our country not even being allowed to see attorneys 

589.00 599.89 A: yeah i agree well i think there's always a balance in these things you know and i think that uh i do agree with you on profiling though and i- it's funny um 

593.57 594.68 B: yeah
