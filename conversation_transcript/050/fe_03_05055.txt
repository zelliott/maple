0.15 1.96 B: hi i'm dana 

1.95 3.63 A: hi i'm ron 

3.43 9.02 B: hi um i don't know much about sports or the recent strikes by athletes 

9.22 14.00 B: but i mean i have some like a visceral reaction i guess which would be like 

13.12 14.05 A: (( okay )) 

14.11 14.74 B: (( mm )) 

14.50 17.54 A: oh go go ahead and let me hear your reactions 

16.81 25.75 B: um i guess i think it's i i don't think that athletes deserve the high salaries that they get and i think that for them to go on strike 

26.14 31.33 B: i don't i don't know what they're striking for um so i can't really say but i think 

31.38 33.53 B: like in general they're pampered 

33.92 38.82 B: so i can't imagine what they'd be going on strike 'cause i feel they get the world anyway 

40.40 43.46 A: right yeah okay yeah i agree with you 

43.49 46.34 A: usually strikes are um 

48.59 55.98 A: okay they're usually for you know the union workers that are middle class 

53.05 53.83 B: right 

55.63 56.58 B: (( right [noise] )) 

56.45 58.47 A: (( and uh )) 

59.95 66.31 A: ordinarily the people striking are are you know they they've got uh 

67.40 68.26 A: (( you know )) 

68.56 78.89 A: a legitimate need to be striking for it these uh i see these professional athletes getting million dollar salaries 

79.01 82.30 A: really don't have the you know 

82.78 89.44 A: i don't feel that they should have the privilege to strike like uh the ordinary wage earner does 

88.30 89.76 B: right i agree 

89.73 90.86 A: okay 

92.13 100.51 A: so that's my feeling on it and but you know they have to be good at what they're doing but uh i definitely feel that they are overpaid 

100.06 105.18 B: [noise] yeah i don't feel like what they do has much value to society as a whole 

106.12 113.13 B: i think there are people who are paid a lot less i mean i like i feel like this is all very obvious for exam- you know teachers for example get paid 

113.26 115.39 B: very little and 

115.95 116.77 B: (( you know )) 

116.11 122.46 A: yeah i agree with you there a coach at a high school or elementary school is 

122.53 126.55 A: is is a very good athlete is not paid much 

126.20 130.62 B: right and certainly i think has more value to the life of 

131.31 139.26 B: you know people like influences children and encourages them to do something positive with their time playing sports after school 

139.82 146.43 B: you know a much better thing to do than coach professional athletes or be a professional athlete i think 

146.52 148.01 B: and like i mean i 

148.29 149.65 B: yeah i think 

150.42 152.81 B: that they're striking is ridiculous 

154.46 155.31 B: (( um )) 

155.60 158.70 A: yeah well we've had some really ridiculous incidents 

159.31 167.75 A: here in where professional basketball players were you know caught using marijuana and and uh 

167.93 168.78 A: [mn] 

168.82 172.07 A: they practically got just a slap on the wrist you 

172.14 176.39 A: know for and keep on playing at their high salary 

176.03 177.01 B: mhm 

177.44 179.41 B: you know if a college student 

179.84 185.78 B: gets caught using marijuana or using drugs of any type and is convicted they'll lose their student loan 

186.38 188.29 A: yeah 

186.81 193.76 B: [noise] and essentially have to like depending on who the student is they may have to drop out of school because of that if they can't pay for 

192.37 194.18 A: (( yeah )) 

194.53 197.35 A: [laughter] how well i know 

197.98 202.37 B: it uh the inequalities of the system are a bit ridiculous at times 

203.18 204.91 B: um saddening 

205.40 214.52 A: well uh you know you you can't okay i'm all against the the striking by professional athletes you know they they're 

214.92 221.11 A: definitely overpaid so there's really no reason for them to be striking 

221.40 232.46 A: but some of the professional athletes do use all the money they get for good causes so i'm all for the the athletes that do that but um 

233.05 234.33 A: uh 

234.48 236.73 A: it's definitely we have 

237.29 242.44 A: a segment of the population very small segment of the population that is 

242.92 246.44 A: definitely being overpaid for what they do 

244.90 245.76 B: mhm 

247.98 248.87 B: yeah 

249.28 251.31 B: absolutely um 

251.95 257.60 B: do you want are are there recent strikes do you know that they're referring to when they posed this topic 

257.75 267.48 A: uh no it's been quite a while since there has been a strike but there's evidently you still hear on the news from time to time they talk about 

267.48 272.93 A: you know a possibility of a strike by this baseball league or 

272.50 273.47 B: mhm 

273.08 275.51 A: or this 

278.06 279.21 A: (( um okay )) 

279.36 289.79 A: yeah especially in baseball you hear it from all the time sometimes you hear it it's about a strike basketball or something else or hockey or whatever 

289.26 290.28 B: mhm 

290.43 299.97 A: you know but uh recently there haven't been any strikes and last time uh i was leaving california last time when they had a baseball strike 

300.16 306.76 A: and there was really a lot of talk against the players and evidently they had a hard time you know 

306.95 311.09 A: getting the fans back after they did strike 

310.40 311.33 B: mhm 

311.72 315.78 B: was that it was it wasn't a national strike it was just in california 

315.71 319.22 A: no it was an a national strike but it uh 

317.80 318.63 B: mhm 

319.59 334.16 A: i was talking about the re- uh results of there when i was living in california that came into san francisco at that time and went on strike with the other strikes throughout the united i mean with the other teams throughout the united states 

326.77 327.65 B: (( mhm mm [laughter] )) 

334.23 338.80 A: and it made a lot of fans very angry because you know 

339.12 340.83 A: [mn] 

340.97 348.05 A: i mean it i'm not into sports myself i do watch a little bit on t._v. from time to time 

348.25 352.82 A: i prefer watching like the globetrotters instead of the others [laughter] 

352.92 356.76 A: but uh so i'm not into sports much myself so 

356.91 365.73 A: you know the high salary that any of these professional athletes get is you know really something i don't i- identify with 

364.29 365.20 B: mhm 

366.80 370.68 B: do you know if they're unionized if there's a professional athlete's union 

370.67 373.90 A: yes ther- as far as i know there is 

373.24 374.13 B: mhm 

374.69 376.45 A: and uh 

376.70 380.84 B: that also yeah that does that also seems ridiculous to me it seems like 

381.60 382.83 B: um like a 

382.84 385.04 B: an abuse of the word union so 

384.68 385.71 A: mhm 

386.97 394.45 A: yeah it's supposed to be there to protect like the middle class workers that's what a union's supposed to be there for 

391.86 392.66 B: (( right )) 

395.00 397.72 A: (( but )) 

397.27 397.92 B: mm 

399.82 403.51 B: yeah i don't i don't follow sports much so [sigh] 

403.80 407.57 B: i don't have much sympathy for the players 

408.05 408.88 B: (( [mn] )) 

409.56 410.31 B: but 

411.37 413.66 B: have you done this study before 

413.26 418.32 A: yes i have been participating and talking with various people
