0.00 1.68 A: [noise] 

1.57 2.79 B: (( hello )) 

2.74 3.61 A: (( hello )) 

3.49 7.06 B: so uh nice to talk with you 

7.50 8.93 A: yeah 

8.34 9.49 B: uh 

9.81 16.15 B: y- you know i'm not a native american um so uh what's the topic of airport security 

15.80 27.71 A: yes it is i'm not a native american either uh b- uh what do you think about airport security what do you think we can do to lessen the chances of a terrorism attacks 

27.96 29.46 B: oh 

29.62 31.55 B: i i think a 

32.13 40.94 B: maybe we need need um some more more high tech measures in in our uh 

38.72 39.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

41.53 43.48 B: ai- in our airports 

44.34 49.06 A: like what kind of uh high tech measures are we talking about 

48.57 50.07 B: um 

50.09 54.46 B: something that can look through more uh accurate 

54.47 58.40 B: x ray machines things like that 

58.30 59.28 A: okay 

59.37 73.41 A: uh i would think that like more of a canine dogs should be allowed into airports uh like the kind that would sniff like bombs and more of a like weapons and stuff 

73.76 83.20 B: (( uh i i i i mean like the more more advanced type tech- technology uh )) 

82.11 84.63 A: [noise] 

83.30 84.82 B: not only for 

84.91 86.28 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

85.47 98.43 B: uh for i- increasing the you know sensitivity of detecting of those uh weapons but also uh for for the convenience of of the passengers 

92.25 94.03 A: [noise] 

99.23 109.38 B: uh m- maybe uh current current situation is is not very good uh passenger must wait very long 

99.24 101.23 A: [noise] right [noise] 

102.80 115.25 A: [noise] [noise] uh that's right uh 

109.91 111.50 B: before they could be boarded 

115.08 129.11 A: i think also we should like have some sort of people like more people working at the airports and checking like every every pa- passenger for like everything that they have like no matter who they are 

129.01 139.37 A: no matter [noise] they're a woman or a man no matter like what nationality they are uh like check in like all of their bags everything that they have in their pockets 

131.39 132.68 B: mhm 

134.04 135.19 B: (( yeah )) 

139.30 147.47 A: and this like would be like some sort of a measure that we could take that would prevent like the would prevent like the real big threat 

148.34 159.81 B: uh and i think another uh area might be the information technology i for example i using networks to 

159.86 163.41 B: to for for tracking criminals 

163.51 168.65 B: i think this should be very fast uh it's like kind of modern technology 

168.52 176.37 A: [noise] [noise] are we talking about like some sort of a computer system that would like have people in it by their names 

176.14 189.18 A: and like track their records like their criminal records and the records of like [noise] where they came from and what kind of activities [noise] they've been doing lately are we talking about something like that 

176.64 177.80 B: yeah 

189.38 191.22 B: uh i think okay 

191.69 193.67 B: uh yeah uh 

194.01 199.91 B: in this system should be i i i think should be should be the the responsi- 

200.92 207.48 B: uh if one if the criminal uh leaves one airport uh 

207.60 213.34 B: o- other possible destinations should be notified and uh 

213.35 214.47 B: uh 

215.25 221.51 B: al- uh and he should be tracked as soon as possible i think 

221.94 234.10 A: [noise] okay so what are three like most important measures that we should take like the three most important steps that we should take towards being more secure 

235.04 238.97 A: in in in american airports 

239.24 240.91 B: uh e- e- 

241.39 244.72 B: (( in air- in air- in airports i )) 

244.73 247.26 B: mean just as you you said just now 

247.36 252.69 B: uh putting more people uh in in this job and uh 

252.74 256.16 B: as wh- as what i mentioned uh 

256.44 261.72 B: just now is the uh using more advanced technology 

262.05 266.87 B: but what what i wanna point out uh is another [mn] um 

268.16 276.55 B: point which which which may be uh neglected uh that is uh the security uh 

271.21 274.82 A: (( [noise] )) 

276.57 282.61 B: on the air uh i i mean on the airplane not only uh in the airport 

278.53 279.23 A: (( [noise] )) 

283.42 289.13 B: uh i i think uh any kind of security measure uh checking 

283.47 284.41 A: okay 

289.22 293.09 B: cannot guarantee one hundred percent um 

293.38 301.69 B: one hundred percent success success rate so um we should prepare for for 

301.76 306.36 B: even a little chance that uh the criminal or the terrorist 

306.48 315.00 B: uh h- has been to or has been on on the plane so what what should we do in in this case 

315.14 327.69 A: [noise] [noise] do you think that we should carry we should put like somebody on a plane with the gun do you think like that kind of security measures should be taken like a security guard with a gun [noise] 

328.05 329.96 B: um uh may- 

329.21 334.12 A: or do you think like a pilot should carry a gun on him 

334.23 345.13 B: i i think um not necessarily a gun which is which might be too destructive um but some some suitable weapons 

345.19 349.03 B: for example that use uh a high voltage 

349.09 351.89 B: uh to to shock uh shock the terrorists 

351.96 353.86 B: and things like that 

353.56 354.89 A: (( [noise] )) 

354.09 355.95 B: and uh 

356.37 363.36 B: i i just wonder why uh wh- why is are the pilots um 

361.76 367.86 A: right [noise] [noise] 

363.64 366.53 B: not separated from from the crew 

366.78 372.04 B: maybe they could be l- locked in another uh in the separate or 

372.13 376.14 B: relatively separate uh separate uh 

376.22 378.54 B: room for driving 

377.41 384.70 A: (( [noise] okay so the crew should be in a different room and they should be like separated with )) 

385.19 388.22 A: from the east side of the plane 

388.87 392.90 A: from the rest of the people that are on a plane 

393.01 398.72 A: [noise] [noise] okay that's a good point that's a very good point 

393.29 394.26 B: uh-huh 

398.87 409.24 A: [noise] uh so that that way anybody wouldn't be able to get in no matter what they were have on or what they have on their minds [noise] [noise] 

401.04 402.17 B: (( mhm )) 

407.34 418.62 B: yeah uh i think uh if we um i- if we can allow others to come into the this room why why not uh 

418.88 422.23 B: uh let um the pilots have the key 

419.50 420.27 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] okay [noise] )) 

420.18 424.26 A: (( yeah that's )) 

423.49 424.45 B: but 

424.24 451.43 A: (( a very good point [noise] )) 

424.51 426.35 B: but maybe that uh 

427.85 431.12 B: but but maybe that that's not not a good point 

431.78 437.83 B: uh the pilots have the the terrorists could could threaten the pilots to open the door 

439.58 444.44 B: so maybe uh sep- separated pilots could uh 

444.69 446.08 B: should be better 

451.95 462.71 A: that's a very good point there that the pilots should be separated from the rest of the crew so there shouldn't be any access to the pilot cockpit 

462.34 464.74 B: right and uh i 

464.84 468.23 B: i i think what they need [mn] uh 

468.64 476.20 B: dr- drinking or food could be applied by by by a- another 

476.41 482.46 B: um maybe or or waitress or or special waitress inside this that room 

479.32 488.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

482.70 483.26 B: (( [mn] )) 

483.56 486.57 B: which is separated from passengers 

487.02 490.76 B: and i think they uh all the information 

491.02 493.14 B: uh they need could be 

492.20 493.97 A: [noise] 

493.22 500.10 B: could be ge- could be get from uh a telephone or or their he- uh headset 

500.65 506.32 B: and and other datas could be trans- transmitted from the satellite 

507.16 511.31 B: i think modern technology could could uh make it possible 

511.24 518.67 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] uh it definitely could nowadays with all the 

518.73 529.05 A: the with everything that's around right now i i i think that it would be really possible [noise] that the airport could really take that kind of security the national 

528.88 533.90 A: (( ones especially of uh with everything that's going on in the world right now )) 

533.92 537.26 A: they just need to [noise] do that because there's too much over 

538.01 539.12 B: uh-huh 

539.36 543.44 A: of a one plane of the damage that they could do 

543.93 550.16 A: [noise] of the damage to an outside world of all the cruelty that they can do 

547.40 548.49 B: yeah 

551.03 558.03 A: it it is just too dangerous but th- those are a very good points that we should make 

558.57 561.86 A: that we should follow maybe somehow 

562.30 574.10 B: right a- and i as for for the weapons you mentioned uh what do you think about uh car- uh carrying a weapon uh by the pilot 

562.40 563.67 A: for the 

571.10 584.49 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] well i think that there is like some sort of weapons that they can carry that like the sword that can damage actual like actual plane 

583.78 584.86 B: (( mhm )) 

584.31 596.47 A: like the bullets that wouldn't go through the plane and make any like damage to it but but again like if there's a threat if there is a threat they can [noise] take care of it 

591.94 592.83 B: (( mhm )) 

596.27 599.96 A: maybe some sort of a gun that they would put like people 

596.36 597.35 B: right
