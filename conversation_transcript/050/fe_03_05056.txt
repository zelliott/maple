0.00 0.98 B: hello 

0.75 2.75 A: hello my name is solomon 

2.98 5.08 B: uh and my name is phillip how are you 

4.72 5.92 A: i'm good how are you 

5.50 10.51 B: pretty good [sigh] how do you feel about the sp- uh about the strikes within sports 

10.26 15.92 A: um i actually wasn't even aware that it was happening recently but i remember when the baseball teams were on strike 

16.12 22.37 B: actua- oh i'm sorry go ahead no i was gonna say uh actually it hap- happened recently but uh 

16.25 17.12 A: um 

17.45 18.60 A: go ahead no 

22.43 31.56 B: uh yeah it uh 'cause i remember a cup- uh you know when was it around four or five years ago when uh the baseball players were gonna possibly get go out on strike a friend of mine she siad 

27.20 28.93 A: mhm 

31.43 37.65 B: oh they get paid so much money she says they don't have a right to go out on strike i says why not i says 

37.50 47.13 B: you know they have a limited career in ba- in in sports why not allow them to to get as much as humanly possible you know i think that's the american way 

44.89 46.56 A: mhm 

47.92 48.91 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

49.24 54.56 A: i don't know i i certainly wouldn't agree with the idea of restricting their ability to go on strike 

54.64 58.18 A: um but i think that uh 

58.35 60.42 A: it's interesting how 

60.43 72.38 A: they have enough money to be organized enough to be able to force you know the franchises to pay them a lot of money while the people who work in the stadiums get paid nothing and don't 

72.26 73.14 B: oh 

72.48 74.07 A: aren't able to organize 

73.39 86.05 B: uh uh no i agree with you completely i agree with you completely that uh you know the stadium personnel like i heard of a someone that apparently he was working at a giants game and they were basically paying him forty dollars 

85.49 86.66 A: (( [mn] [noise] right )) 

85.96 91.03 B: and then after tax and everything [mn] i just can imagine what the person was getting 

91.45 101.83 B: yeah no no no oh but uh like for example i don't know if you're aware that baseball it's uh it's uh protected by the government that no one else could compete against baseball 

92.71 93.61 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

101.51 106.93 A: it's you mean it's it's it's not supposed to be in on like in the open market 

106.43 118.10 B: [mn] no no no it uh actually it's written in the in the federal law yeah at the turn of the century i don't know how i i've always been interested in in researching that somewhat to find out what the reason is 

110.67 111.38 A: huh 

117.77 119.73 A: it's probably a good idea 

119.33 130.77 B: oh it is but i don't think n- now it would necessarily get passed but maybe now with the the government that we have right that is very conservative they might do it [laughter] you never know you never know but uh 

119.95 120.91 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

127.59 129.01 A: right [laughter] 

129.59 130.44 A: right 

131.16 135.79 B: yeah no uh like for example like uh what was it like um 

135.67 150.10 B: how they um in tennis i'm a big fan of tennis and with uh with uh billie jean king and uh you know them trying to not unionize but uh try and become more organized and try try to demand a little more money 

149.87 156.46 B: from the sponsors and everything and it did great for them and i i've always believed that you know 

157.04 162.94 B: what is wrong with people making more money like in new y- i don't know where where are you physically 

162.21 163.44 A: (( [noise] [noise] i'm in philadelphia )) 

163.60 170.96 B: philadelphia all right i'm in new york city and uh i know uh the person that owns the yankees uh george steinburner 

164.12 164.90 A: yeah 

165.24 166.02 A: oh okay 

168.93 169.76 A: (( oh )) 

170.74 173.90 A: personally oh [laughter] 

171.54 172.96 B: no no no 

173.42 178.37 B: but uh he's exceedingly exceedingly wealthy and uh 

176.58 177.57 A: oh yeah 

178.18 189.84 B: you know a lot of the baseball players you know they're in the base- in the sports game for maybe eight years or so why not allow them to make as much as humanly possible i i don't have a problem with that but unfortunately it seems that 

189.74 193.90 B: united states it seems that a lot of people are very anti labor 

193.23 195.20 A: [noise] right yeah oh definitely true 

194.98 197.24 B: oh you fe- you ge- you have the same impression 

195.91 196.94 A: but but 

197.01 204.56 A: oh definitely i come from the south i i grew up in florida in the south it's incredibly anti union i mean philadelphia's a big big union town 

203.90 205.39 B: oh yeah i know that 

204.51 213.15 A: and new york is more th- the south too i mean northeast is in general but it's still nothing compared to i mean i have friends that have been over to europe and they say 

208.38 209.44 B: (( right right )) 

213.10 222.07 A: i mean i've heard so many stories of oh yeah i couldn't do this 'cause so you know so and so and so and so were on strike and i'm always kind of like well that's great [laughter] 'cause i i'm i'm very pro union but um 

218.91 219.88 B: yeah 

220.97 224.01 B: oh how refreshing how refreshing 

223.05 224.70 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

224.06 237.99 B: yeah you don't hear many people say that and they don't realize like for example in europe i uh i've gone out with women that were from like uh one was from switzerland and one was from belgium and she said oh that they get six uh seven weeks vacation 

237.53 238.97 A: oh yeah absolutely 

238.27 248.19 B: and uh friends of mine that they're from germany that they uh maternity leave is i how long i think a year and a half and then you can get a year and a year extension 

239.38 240.26 A: uh-huh 

247.59 249.27 A: uh-huh definitely 

248.75 251.02 B: and that's at two thirds pay 

250.51 251.32 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

251.58 257.99 B: and you know we we em- what i i i've always found very interesting is that we emphasis in this country 

257.86 272.51 B: uh you know you watch television you listen to the radio you constantly hear about you know the business and you know how uh you know profits have gone up for one company or another but you never hear about people and about you know how it's affecting people's lives and everything 

271.54 272.52 A: yeah 

272.39 280.42 B: and uh i i've always found that interesting and mo- and most americans i don't really find really questioning that at all and especially in these times right now 

277.76 288.04 A: mhm yeah definitely and i and i feel like most of the i mean and and i'm also speaking personally but i feel like most people's uneasiness with the idea of sports figures 

287.95 300.52 A: unionizing is not because they're anti union but because they're already really really wealthy and i definitely wouldn't feel like it would be right to restrict them from unionizing but i guess my concern is more like the idea of saying 

290.65 291.33 B: mm 

296.58 297.68 B: (( no uh-uh )) 

300.52 307.19 A: i think people should be able to get as much f- money as they physically can um usually means somebody else isn't going to 

304.13 305.09 B: right 

307.09 308.10 B: right huh 

307.32 316.77 A: um and so i guess my reluctance is bec- is is more like well these these people have the money already to be able to unionize and make more money [noise] and um 

315.23 316.10 B: right 

317.41 320.63 A: uh and and i i can't really think of any like 

321.12 324.86 A: governmental or or any kind of law that would be able to allow 

324.91 328.29 A: you know them to still do that but to somehow 

328.24 342.35 A: you know spread the the wealth of you know unions or whatever to other folks but that's my main concern is like these people are already making a ton of money and i think that they should have the right to unionize but 

342.57 346.79 A: you know what abo- what about they're making so much money what about these people who aren't making any money 

346.34 347.99 B: oh no n- no 

346.97 349.38 A: yeah oh i know you're not saying that but 

348.90 359.88 B: yeah no like for example i just heard like uh last week that they were i heard on the radio that they were discussing about how many universities so few of uh professors are tenure professors any longer 

359.57 360.72 A: really 

360.12 368.09 B: and uh you kn- i i i realized this when i was in college that they were starting to hire part time teachers and this fifteen years ago 

367.62 368.54 A: right 

367.95 380.29 B: and apparently it has gotten progressively worse and it seems like half half the half the teachers are part timers th- they just give them a contract you know for you know one semester or two semesters 

374.88 375.80 A: right 

380.19 383.98 B: and just pay them they don't have to worry about others uh other things 

384.06 385.37 B: and um 

385.43 387.40 B: no unfortunately um 

387.76 392.66 B: [lipsmack] and i don't see it improving either unfortunately yeah no 

390.23 391.84 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

392.14 393.53 A: and i think um 

394.05 399.11 A: [noise] i think another kind of way to look at it is you were talking about steinbi- steinbremer is that his name 

398.36 401.55 B: st- steinburner yeah 

399.28 402.24 A: steinburner um he's certainly making a ton of money 

401.99 403.29 B: y- indeed 

402.31 416.25 A: and i'm sure he's making more money that most of the athletes that are striking against him so i can certainly support it in that context 'cause it's still a step down from trying to take the you know egregious amount of money that steinburner has and try to spread it out a little bit more 

404.86 406.86 B: [mn] most definitely yeah 

408.71 409.87 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

416.13 426.35 B: ye- like for example i always say i say why you know they say oh these base- such and such baseball players are getting so much money i says yeah but how much is steinburner making 

425.71 427.25 A: yeah yeah right 

426.34 431.57 B: how much is he worth but they never ask that because i once again i live in new york city 

427.74 428.54 A: right 

431.34 441.53 B: and like rents were so expensive and the landlords always think oh the rent uh the rents are so low we aren't m- we aren't barely making to pay our bills and everything 

438.26 439.08 A: right 

441.43 444.17 B: and people always say why don't we see 

443.98 456.61 B: show open the books show us how much you're losing and if you're losing so much money then maybe we wo- we would consider possibly uh giving you a larger increase in rent but they never want to do that because to be honest with you 

445.83 446.67 A: yeah 

446.86 448.44 A: (( right that [noise] )) 

453.21 454.09 A: definitely 

456.44 459.85 B: i don't think that i don't think they are losing money 

457.70 458.59 A: no 

459.16 468.34 A: no if they're if they are then that's fine and people will you know believe them and if if they say that enough people [noise] they'll they'll gain power that way 

468.06 471.84 B: ex- exac- exactly exactly how long have you been in philadelphia 

471.42 473.35 A: [noise] i've only been here about two years 

472.75 476.26 B: all right all right it's a nice town i come down every once in a while 

475.57 477.03 A: [noise] yeah i like it [noise] 

476.44 485.33 B: yeah i i ran the philadelphia marathon when was it two years ago three years ago yeah have you checked out the museums over there yeah they're nice 

480.61 481.73 A: yeah 

483.50 484.41 A: (( yeah on- )) 

485.52 486.59 B: they're nice 

486.20 500.70 A: one more thing that you had said that made me think of um the way that even union situations are talked about in this country is when you were talking about let's look at how much steinburner has it's never talked about and i remember recently whenever the airline industries were were 

492.50 493.50 B: right 

495.18 496.09 B: right 

500.52 501.44 A: (( you know )) 

501.87 511.11 A: financially not doing too well and a bunch of the the union members decided that they were willing to take a pay cut um and then they took a pay cut and then 

507.36 508.50 B: right 

511.08 521.16 A: i guess written into that the c._e._o. or somebody lik- somebody high up like that wasn't allowed to take wasn't allowed to have any kind of raises but they took they took one anyway 

519.43 523.48 B: oh yeah yes the the american airlines yeah oh yeah e- e- 

521.50 533.59 A: right and and my my thought is always well if all these you know service all these people that work for the airlines are going to take a pay cut what about the guy at the top like that's you should look at him and see how much money he's making 

533.33 535.43 B: (( e- exactly )) 

533.85 537.39 A: and then give him a cut first and then cut the rest 

536.77 545.49 B: e- exactly exactly in this country we hate using the word cla- you know the the demo- yeah the democrats are always so reluctance in debating the republicans 

540.85 542.05 A: class yeah 

545.27 550.66 B: saying the word class you know they all the republicans always say oh it's class warfare i says 

549.62 551.19 A: oh yeah yeah 

550.51 561.73 B: and i says but the one thing no it's not class warfare but rather i don't think um uh bill gates is worrying about the average person making fifty sixty thousand dollars each year 

560.54 561.97 A: (( [noise] [noise] no )) 

561.52 567.23 B: he's not worried about sending his kids to college he doesn't have to worry about such things and you know 

565.06 566.26 A: right 

567.58 571.59 B: [mn] and and i don't know if you're a republican or a democrat but 

570.35 574.66 A: no i wouldn't even call myself a democrat [laughter] i'd say i was more to the left than that 

572.84 586.27 B: i ye- yeah ac- actually me too me too [laughter] yeah my politics are more to the left i actually i voted green the last uh two or i think twelve or the last twelve years i've voted uh green 

580.80 582.32 A: (( yeah so did )) 

585.70 586.74 A: i yeah me too 

586.94 590.89 B: i just saw ralph nader on cspan uh c._n._n. a little while ago 

590.49 592.08 A: yeah 

592.43 594.19 B: but uh what else what else 

593.32 599.89 A: yeah i definitely notice the same thing um in terms of not using i remember when the the republicans were were trying to
