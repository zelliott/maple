0.30 1.80 B: hi i'm david 

1.24 2.74 A: hi i'm mike 

3.73 5.77 A: so what uh go ahead 

3.77 4.72 B: (( do you spor- )) 

5.24 18.40 B: okay well i'm i don't think that they should get as much money as they do i mean they don't really do much and um i mean really i i mean they do have talent but i don- i think they are over paid because 

18.73 26.17 B: i mean they're doing what they enjoy and um they only work for maybe three fourths of the year and um 

26.23 30.93 B: they get all these perks so i don't think that they should get paid that much 

31.06 43.89 A: well the biggest problem i have is that they go out on strike but for what reason it's not like the conditions are terrible or that their pay is bad or anything even the low paid uh athletes 

43.88 53.39 A: uh get paid more than a lot of people i know who are working and struggling to make ends meet so what do they have to go out on strike for 

47.65 49.43 B: that's that's true 

53.20 56.54 B: yeah well when they do go on strike i find that they 

57.36 68.55 B: that it's really the fans who get hurt and you have to pay a lot of money now to go to see a professional sports game and it doesn't seem that they care at all about their fans and really their only 

68.48 77.23 B: like redeeming quality is because they do serve as distractions so many people do get involved but it seems that sports players today 

77.12 84.07 B: don't really uh don't really care much about the fans and you know if the game paid so much it wouldn't hurt them to 

84.78 86.92 B: it wouldn't hurt them to be 

87.87 89.35 B: uh be that 

89.40 90.32 B: you know 

89.94 96.47 A: be more uh receptive to what their their fans are feeling they're there for the fans they're not there for the pay check 

91.88 92.96 B: exactly 

96.62 106.50 A: uh i mean yes they've they want to get paid like anybody who does a job but their whole reason for being there are the people without the fans they don't have 

106.65 115.12 A: uh a team they don't have anything because if the fans didn't show up there'd be nobody to pay their salaries 'cause that's where they get their money from is the fans 

114.48 123.44 B: right and and you know i'm surprised so people still do show up at i mean it's so expensive to go see a baseball game or e- or like a football game is astronomical 

123.54 126.33 B: and you see the players getting paid 

126.50 133.73 B: is um millions and millions of dollars to play such a short season and then like you said they go on strike and uh 

133.75 137.88 B: just to they're demanding more money but for why is it for more 

138.11 147.83 B: is it for more money i mean you know they've already getting so much money how much do you need and so many of them just spend their money on their drug habits or um 

147.78 154.18 A: or just they just fritter it away they just spend it on a lot of things that they don't need i mean 

147.92 148.70 B: or just 

152.76 153.79 B: right 

154.27 158.11 A: how many cars can you drive certainly not not ten or twelve 

157.55 158.63 B: [laughter] 

157.96 170.02 A: i mean uh and you you hear every now and then about one of them they have multiple cars sitting in their garage but but why they have five houses but they can't live in more than one or two if they go back and forth between the coast or whatever 

169.81 178.19 B: right i i think a lot of it is that they're maybe their managers or their agents really push them to to not take these 

170.32 171.43 A: (( uh )) 

178.40 191.30 B: these deals like to not take a a deal that they offered to ask for more because they're getting a percentage of it and they're getting uh you know maybe ten percent and ten percent of a few million is a lot of a money 

190.66 195.12 A: oh i know i mean ten ten percent of a few thousand is a lot of money for me 

194.22 195.76 B: yeah 

195.17 209.54 A: uh but uh i do enjoy sports but i stick with more of the local teams not the high school but the uh the semi professional to the professional that are local they're not the the major leagues 

202.47 203.36 B: mhm 

209.37 222.18 A: they're more of the triple a the minor leagues so you get just as much enjoyment uh and half the time the the people you are watching are going to the major leagues anyway so you're not you know you're not watching something that's 

214.32 215.40 B: right 

222.16 233.93 A: uh stick ball in some dirt lot somewhere or sort of or in the case of football you know just some ratty old ball with some kids playing you're actually watching some high caliber stuff 

233.31 234.66 B: yeah and 

233.90 243.19 A: but it's it's local to you or nearby and it doesn't cost as much and you don't have to worry about well they're not going to play because they're not getting anymore than five million this year 

243.58 254.66 B: right and they and then when you go to see a minor league game it's a lot more um you know they they're more willing to sign autographs and uh they're more willing to like throw a ball to you or to 

254.42 262.53 B: or just to to say hello or to wave than a major league person and you get a lot closer to the game when you go see a um minor league 

262.19 274.22 A: absolutely and and they actually try harder they put more of their heart into what they're doing instead of saying well hey i got my eight million if if i don't make a home run this time well too bad they still have to pay me 

262.73 264.26 B: a minor league team 

274.39 275.28 B: right 

274.50 276.03 A: you know i 

276.19 287.16 A: you you get some of the major leagues like that but there's a lot as soon as they hit the major leagues they think well now i'm better than everybody else i don't have to try as hard uh and i don't care what anybody thinks because this is the way it is 

286.78 291.37 B: yeah they probably are trying pretty hard when they're in the minor leagues if they want to get up to that level 

291.49 303.32 B: and they're not they're not going to worry much about getting a salary at that point they've got a very high salary they're going to worry more about their performance and how they're you know how they're doing 

303.04 305.08 A: mhm uh 

304.21 306.93 B: so and working on their their game mhm 

306.30 315.37 A: right right i mean if you if you think about how it was years ago just what they'd what they were shown in newspapers or whatever talked about 

315.38 324.86 A: they used to play for the love of the game because they didn't get paid even thousands of dollars they were lucky if they got like you know a few hundred a year 

325.57 331.18 A: but i mean it's so it's it's silly for them to go out on strike because 

331.29 337.17 A: it's not for anything worthwhile other than we want more money that's all we're going for 

334.85 335.73 B: right 

338.27 346.55 B: but i mean but yeah a lot of times did you have a professional in teams now 'specially like here i know they have a women's football league 

346.61 354.18 B: and um it seems that even though they're professionals and they don't get paid that much because it's not more like a soccer league for instance 

353.47 354.91 A: mhm 

354.30 368.95 B: they it's still the same in there as opposed to football or baseball or basketball because it it hasn't really been so commercialized and you don't really have agents and managers and all these intermediaries who are 

369.38 370.35 B: (( who are )) 

370.75 374.39 B: pushing the players to take more money and be a bit more greedy mhm 

374.01 385.44 A: right right and i mean i'm i'm not sure where you live but i live in south central new york we have a hockey team and we have a baseball team both of which are like the the uh 

385.84 391.70 A: one's in a._h._l. one's uh like can't remember if it's double a or triple a 

391.68 396.95 A: uh hockey i mean um baseball so a lot of our people do end up 

396.90 410.21 A: in the major uh teams and it's nice to read about it but i still enjoy everything that they do here i mean i i enjoy it as much as i would if i'd paid you know thirty five bucks to go see 

409.65 411.42 B: and you enjoy the game as much 

410.88 413.52 A: i enjoy it even more actually 

412.90 415.70 B: (( oh okay do you follow the teams [laughter] mhm )) 

415.17 424.28 A: uh i do follow the teams for the most part i've slacked off a little bit in the last couple of months because we've had better weather and i do more stuff outside instead of being inside as much 

423.42 425.12 B: that's understandable 

424.73 430.92 A: yeah but um our our hockey team uh i don't know if you follow hockey at all 

430.82 431.94 B: mm a little 

431.88 435.31 A: uh do you follow the american hockey league or no 

435.54 437.43 B: no only n._h._l. 

436.18 437.02 A: okay 

437.20 439.33 A: okay well um 

439.49 450.53 A: our uh our hockey team is the senators subsidiary of the other senators the n._h._l. senators and they came in second in the a._h._l. they almost took the the title 

444.29 445.22 B: okay 

450.45 455.96 A: so we we do pretty we do pretty good and um the b. sens- 

451.26 452.16 B: oh they 

456.24 457.96 A: oh no wait let me think 

458.44 462.90 A: no it's not the senators i'm sorry i'm getting them mixed up now 

464.22 465.30 A: okay 

464.45 467.22 B: [laughter] that was the hockey team you're talking about right 

466.64 472.70 A: i was talking about the hockey team but they're not named the senators the senators is the baseball team uh 

471.79 472.71 B: (( okay )) 

472.81 480.68 A: but anyway i mean we're we're we do we do fairly well here and i i like it every bit as much it's every bit as much uh 

482.60 489.62 A: uh well that do exciting is not really the word i'm looking for but that that'll do as good as anything else it's exciting 

482.90 484.14 B: as exciting 

489.67 497.40 A: i mean h- you're right there and for me if i wanted to go see like the n._h._l. or i wanted to go uh see 

497.28 506.97 A: um the american league or national league baseball or something like that i'd have to tra- probably travel about a hundred and fifty miles just to see a game in person 

504.96 505.92 B: (( hm )) 

506.69 509.15 B: yeah and it'd be very expensive too 

507.02 508.38 A: and for me 

508.76 513.64 A: for me i mean even if the cost were way down it's still a long ways to go 

513.49 514.44 B: mhm 

513.83 523.63 A: to see a game and then try to get back after another you know we're we're talking like three hours each way so it's it's not an easy thing and at least here at least i get to see 

523.80 527.42 A: what i think is high quality i really do 

525.76 529.04 B: [sigh] yeah well it yeah well these like you said they 

529.09 539.64 B: they are it's not like they're they're just coming off the street but they're in a you know they're um they are of a level that they're playing for a subsidiary of a major league team and uh 

539.62 541.91 A: and on many times they get called up 

541.68 547.89 B: yeah and sometimes some of the people in the major leagues get called you know put down so you see them too 

547.88 548.70 A: yeah 

547.99 553.88 B: well i know there was a baseball team that uh it was a yankee subsidiary and like um 

553.65 564.43 B: what was his name uh darryl strawberry was playing for them and a lot of people went to go see him and you know it's exciting to see these people in the smaller venue you get a lot closer and um 

558.90 560.09 A: mhm 

564.57 570.74 B: it's a i think it's far more interesting than sitting in a big stadium and being so far away and so far removed 

569.57 578.39 A: oh i know the the the the major teams have uh stadiums that are so big and if you're not one of the lucky ones to get down close 

578.40 583.12 A: you may as well bring binoculars or watch it on t._v. you get just about as close 

581.10 582.18 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

583.17 584.52 B: yeah 

584.05 593.32 A: but it's um getting back on track a little bit 'cause i don't know how they'll really like people getting off track too much um 

589.50 590.80 B: (( [laughter] )) 

594.49 599.89 A: personally if there was a major league team right here in town
