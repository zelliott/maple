86.49 88.48 A: yeah 

90.01 101.22 A: yeah and again there's the time factor you know i can i can watch t._v. or i can read a book while doing it it's just having the time to do it you know if i get home at one or one thirty in the morning i don't wanna get on a bicycle 

95.66 97.26 B: of annoying [noise] mhm yeah eighty hours a week would be 

101.07 103.61 B: no [laughter] i i imagine that 

102.03 102.98 A: (( you know )) 

103.20 107.43 A: if i've worked a fourteen or sixteen hour day i don't wanna lift weights [laughter]

127.11 132.80 B: you know in the parking lot pushing carts with uh some of my employees or working out in the tire shop but 

132.94 135.14 B: it's uh more of a 

134.25 137.29 A: (( yeah ))

149.66 150.73 B: (( yeah mm )) 

153.40 157.47 A: plus you get used to that so it's not it doesn't have serve any value as an exercise 

158.38 161.68 A: you know if it's something that you do every day your body's used to it 

160.81 164.83 B: mm [sigh] absolutely do you play any sports for exercise

170.59 172.08 B: that's tough 

174.84 181.51 B: [laughter] hey they say uh taking care of kids burns like i don't even know how many calories a day but it's supposed to be a pretty good workout 

181.24 183.72 A: well it'll it'll work you out that's true 

184.10 185.30 A: but uh 

185.31 195.52 A: you know again that you know it's not structured [noise] it's not designed to do [noise] you know a certain thing if if you're doing a particular workout or a a weight routine or whatever it 

190.48 191.38 B: yeah 

193.97 198.18 B: yeah it's not like you're in your target heart rate for twenty minutes or anything like that 

197.26 203.75 A: right exactly so it doesn't it doesn't so much serve value as exercise per se 

198.61 199.78 B: (( but yeah )) 

201.31 202.17 B: yeah 

203.37 206.23 B: yeah i've got a little more free time than you i've got [sigh]

218.85 224.35 A: oh that's good that's good i mean you know i've had you know and of course when i was single there was other [noise] 

224.15 237.56 A: you know there was a lot more free time um you know even though i worked just as many hours i had time to be able to do things like that but you know of course with a family and all you have to spend time caring for them and and you know you'd rather spend time with them anyway 

225.93 227.40 B: yeah 

237.86 238.61 A: (( [cough] )) 

238.02 239.16 B: yeah

244.61 246.41 B: and they start gaining weight [laughter] 

246.52 249.87 A: well i i i did [laughter] you know i [laughter] 

250.46 252.04 A: you know i don't know uh 

252.08 261.56 A: yeah pretty much everybody i know too yeah except for my cousin but he just one of those people that's got a metabolism so fast he can eat pure sugar and still be skinny 

254.35 255.11 B: yeah when 

261.14 273.84 B: yeah actually i'm i'm kinda like that too yeah in high school i ate like [lipsmack] i had uh breakfast and then i brought eight sandwiches to school and i brought ate a school lunch and then had a snack after lunch 

263.29 264.14 A: really 

269.54 270.91 A: ouch 

273.99 276.03 B: like in the afternoon during school 

276.29 281.43 B: and then a snack before weightlifting and then supper and then a snack after supper 

281.79 292.78 A: well as long as you're burning it all that doesn't matter but you know i mean i have a resting heart rate of fifty six you know my metabolism is y- you know it's in reverse it's not even in first gear 

283.57 285.90 B: [laughter] yeah that was during high school 

292.66 296.99 B: well a heart rate of fifty six that's doing pretty good that's a pretty healthy heart 

296.42 300.10 A: yeah it's a good heart but it just means i'm chunky [laughter] 

299.57 302.29 B: 'cause my resting is sixty two 

302.01 303.90 A: mhm that's not [noise] bad either 

303.70 305.77 B: but i burn it off pretty easily 

305.87 309.34 A: yeah but i don't i just never have and then 

309.45 316.32 A: you know looking back at my family tree i'm the i'm the same shape as my father and his father and looking at pictures his father 

315.09 315.86 B: (( [noise] )) 

316.50 317.69 B: yeah 

317.43 321.24 A: so i'm like hm i think i see a pattern developing here 

320.23 321.47 B: [laughter] 

321.46 325.21 A: you know i don't know if i'm gonna be uh just stuck with this or not but 

325.34 331.24 A: you know my dad stayed pretty healthy he did he was uh in construction and carpentry actually most of my family was 

330.61 332.79 B: mhm oh that's great work 

331.96 341.33 A: you know a lot of lot of real physical activity so uh you know even though he had some had some paunch around him he was still you know as strong as an ox more or less 

333.76 334.93 B: yeah 

340.37 341.39 B: yeah 

341.96 352.20 B: yeah that's good work my grandpa was like that he did a lot of physical work and he stayed thin his entire life and my dad was thin until he got a sit down job and then he got the huge paunch 

347.71 349.46 A: mhm 

352.79 355.35 A: yeah those sit down jobs just are no good for you 

356.27 361.32 A: i mean no doubt you know i kind of aspire to one one day and then i reali- i'll probably really be bad 

362.51 363.50 A: (( you know )) 

362.59 367.18 B: yeah [laughter] yeah i wouldn't i couldn't stand it my body up like my metabolism 

367.23 375.37 B: i'm not sure it's weird the way it runs if i sit down for a little while like half an hour or an hour if i'm not really actively keeping my mind busy 

375.41 377.93 B: my body just starts to shut down it's like okay come 

378.30 381.22 A: [noise] okay we haven't done anything time to go to sleep 

378.42 381.65 B: on cells sleep time yep time to go to sleep [laughter] 

382.57 393.52 A: yeah uh i amaze the people that work for me 'cause you know they oh man i'm gonna be up 'til four or five o'clock i just can't go home and i just can't unwind i was like what are you talking about i can walk in the door and lay down and go to sleep 

382.91 383.64 B: but 

392.89 394.13 B: [laughter] 

393.78 400.04 A: matter of fact i've been known to fall asleep in my car sitting there when i get home you know what are you talking about you can't stop 

396.96 398.43 B: [laughter] 

400.65 406.92 B: [sigh] it's like my mom my mom goes and goes and goes but as soon as she she's the same way as me as soon as she stops she's out 

406.41 407.82 A: it's over with 

407.24 409.28 B: i've seen her fall asleep in the car 

409.07 413.09 A: yeah and i i can't say i've ever done that 

409.31 411.04 B: at a stop light [laughter] 

413.41 420.84 A: i've i've fallen asleep while driving but that's a result from overwork and not sleeping [laughter] not a result from my metabolism 

417.91 418.76 B: yeah 

420.43 425.30 B: yeah how far away from work do you live like you ever considered like biking to work or anything or 

424.78 430.46 A: uh no i live about uh twenty five minutes away from from where i work 

428.47 429.78 B: oh yeah that'll 

430.03 431.47 B: that'll kind of wreck it mm 

431.15 436.31 A: yeah and it goes all through uh all through town and there's not really a good safe route to do it 

436.90 438.06 A: you know what i mean 

438.14 441.67 B: yeah is it like a a urban area or rural oh 

441.41 444.93 A: uh it goes through both actually i'm kind of suburban 

445.22 446.23 B: (( gotcha yeah no [sigh] )) 

445.41 448.99 A: uh but you have to go through a s- a semi urban area 

449.08 452.75 A: to get to where i work unless you're gonna take a really long 

453.22 454.28 A: (( route )) 

454.76 456.67 A: and uh you know 

457.01 459.51 A: there's no point in that 

459.75 465.17 A: but uh you know there's just not a safe place for you to ride you'd be risking life and limb every time you did it and [noise] 

465.96 467.06 A: you know what i mean 

466.68 478.43 B: [noise] [noise] yeah i can't say i identify too much uh where i live there's plenty of like trails for bikes and like there's even some of the suburbs up here have a the they make the road extra wide and they have a bike lane 

472.37 473.18 A: (( mm )) 

478.66 480.18 B: on the right hand side 

479.58 481.21 A: oh yeah that'd be nice 

480.89 483.79 B: it's kinda kinda cool actually mhm 

482.16 483.33 A: that'd be nice but 

483.46 486.55 A: the only thing they're widening the roads here for is more cars 

487.44 492.03 A: 'cause uh the traffic here is horrendous in the afternoon and in the morning 

492.51 498.78 A: but that's just you know uh roads that are designed for fifty thousand people and then you have a hundred thousand people driving on 'em 

498.01 501.34 B: yeah actually they're doing that a lot of that around my town too they're making 

501.37 508.63 B: the the one of the roads in the north end of town and one of the roads in the s- uh south side of town they're widening 'em out to six lanes so it's 

508.21 508.99 A: (( mm )) 

510.92 513.89 B: [sigh] yeah we have we have really bad traffic too like that 

511.38 512.58 A: (( six lanes )) 

514.02 518.59 A: i think that i think it's getting that way pretty much anywhere you go unless you live way out in the country 

517.73 522.45 B: yeah that's one of the other things like one of the gyms i used to go to was fifteen minutes away 

522.17 524.81 A: mhm 

523.08 527.38 B: and that was with good traffic bad traffic it was half an hour 

527.40 529.32 A: oh yeah 

527.84 531.08 B: and i was paying you know a pretty decent membership fee too 

531.25 534.95 B: so i after a while i was like okay i can't handle this any more 

535.19 539.46 B: so i found the the y._m._c._a. was only like ten minutes away that's even with traffic so 

535.40 536.39 A: no 

539.98 541.17 B: it's pretty nice 

541.06 545.08 A: oh that's not bad that's the biggest reason why we got a why we got a home thing you know 

545.04 546.28 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

545.69 552.33 A: so that you wouldn't have to you don't have to get out you don't have to do it you know when you got you know when you have some time you can just jump over there on it 

551.76 556.57 B: yeah yeah i've got a few weights in my basement too just like free weights i used to have a bench but 

556.69 562.86 B: my you know there's a lot of kids in my family and for a while our basement was so full of stuff that we couldn't use it so i threw it away 

561.13 563.70 A: mhm 

563.48 565.99 B: [sigh] but i keep a few free weights just down there so 

566.01 568.46 B: if i have a little bit of free time i can be like oh okay 

568.85 569.89 A: (( there you go )) 

570.02 571.42 B: just get something going 

571.22 576.99 A: well the way our house is we had to get one of the tower systems where you're more or less uh sitting up in the machine 

577.10 584.92 A: it's uh it's much better for your upper body than lower body which is okay because i have a really strong lower body i don't need to work that out i actually just need to [sigh] 

583.75 584.96 B: mhm 

584.94 591.54 A: uh the whole thing with the with the bike was to i have really i have really muscular legs but i carry a lot of fat on my thighs 

591.37 592.16 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

592.42 599.89 A: so you know that was the biggest reason for the bike i need to gain upper body mass and strength uh and i need to lose some some weight on my thi- 

592.44 593.59 B: (( mm gotcha ))
