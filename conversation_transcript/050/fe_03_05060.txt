59.14 60.65 B: (( i know )) 

60.99 62.68 B: now personally 

62.69 66.82 B: i think they need to learn to get a real job [laughter] 

64.91 70.40 A: [laughter] yeah that's why they were going to college so they could get a real job eventually right 

69.32 71.34 B: (( [noise] exactly )) 

70.76 72.77 A: yeah well mo- most of the 

71.42 79.01 B: not to have a job like this [noise] but then we probably shouldn't complain because we're probably only making thirty thousand when they're [noise] making millions you know 

73.56 74.39 A: right 

78.91 84.37 A: yeah yeah well you know i guess if i could make the money i would probably try but you know [laughter]

93.24 96.35 A: (( too bad them going on strike when they're making all that money )) 

96.22 105.68 B: [noise] well [noise] why would you have to go on strike just so you could make more money that's what i don't get [noise] i mean [noise] just for more health benefits 'cause they always run out of money anyway 

101.16 102.25 A: (( yeah you )) 

105.77 107.53 A: yeah most of 'em don't have 

107.55 108.61 A: (( um )) 

108.69 114.32 A: the right manager or whatever help them manage their money so they waste it along the way and they never seem to have anything at the end do they 

113.48 124.23 B: [noise] exactly my mom does financing for some of these big ball players that want to have multi million dollar homes [noise] but they're so far in debt and everything else that they can't even approve them for them 

120.80 121.58 A: (( uh )) 

124.01 127.30 A: yeah tha- that's what we call broke at a higher level huh 

127.17 128.28 B: (( yeah )) 

127.64 129.45 A: [laughter] yeah 

128.70 131.75 B: learn to live like the normal guy like us 

131.27 134.76 A: if they could live like us and then have all that money in the bank that'd be all right 

134.66 135.79 B: (( exactly [noise] )) 

135.13 137.54 A: and later on they would have it when they needed it they 

136.92 140.02 B: [noise] it's called investing [noise] but obviously 

139.10 140.37 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

140.09 143.26 B: [noise] they're investors aren't good huh [laughter] [noise] 

140.89 141.91 A: (( the fact is )) 

142.30 146.86 A: right have you priced a ticket to go to one of these professional sports lately 

143.44 144.67 B: (( [noise] )) 

147.12 148.69 B: i'm sorry i missed that 

148.45 153.83 A: have you have you priced what it takes to get into the game where one of these you know have you lately 

153.56 158.92 B: well actually we went to a minnesota twins game and it cost us fifty six bucks a ticket 

158.82 160.89 A: yeah that's 

159.88 162.60 B: just to get in to see it 

161.44 164.95 A: that's because they're charging to uh paying those high salaries 

165.24 168.82 B: well and that's i mean at between every single game 

168.92 180.41 B: was [sigh] i mean inning was some kind of endorsement they'd throw this ball under this pickup truck and [noise] try to win the truck kind of thing [noise] you there there was so much endorsing from just 

180.83 182.85 B: [sigh] [noise] cellphones to everything 

181.22 182.13 A: (( there is )) 

182.87 184.20 A: it gets to be like a 

183.00 184.86 B: you feel like you're not watching the game 

184.98 187.54 A: and i guess it'd be like a circus rather than a ball game doesn't 

186.57 190.25 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] exactly [laughter] it would )) 

188.88 191.25 A: it too many extra activities and 

190.66 195.21 B: yeah we saw chickens running around and stuff like that trying to make people 

195.31 198.23 B: catch a tee shirt that's being flung in the air 

198.31 200.05 B: (( i don't know i just [noise] )) 

198.38 200.11 A: there are there are 

200.04 205.98 A: i remember when my son was about eight or nine years old playing little league we took him to the boston red sox game 

205.03 206.15 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

205.90 214.32 A: and we took the whole team out and it was a a real fun day because we were able to teach them by watching the big guys play because they played a game 

213.34 216.01 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] 

214.15 221.50 A: they didn't have all these extra activities i mean we didn't we [laughter] we didn't have to worry about them going on strike or anything because now this is twenty years ago so they were 

216.27 217.62 B: (( [laughter] )) 

221.52 224.05 A: uh ready to play ball at that point you know 

222.21 236.07 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well in i agree with little kids need you know even adults need to watch just so they can learn how to play ball better 'cause there is techniques to it [noise] but i think it has more to do with the pitcher [noise] 

224.52 225.28 A: i 

230.80 231.59 A: yeah 

237.14 241.68 A: well yeah it [laughter] it's what pitchers do most of the time isn't it 

237.32 238.87 B: (( watching [noise] )) 

241.36 242.97 B: yeah [noise] 

242.04 243.01 A: yeah 

243.19 244.97 A: but where are you where are you located 

245.18 247.57 B: [noise] i'm in minnesota 

245.18 246.53 A: are you in minnesota 

247.22 250.59 A: (( are you yeah well that i'm down in south carolina now )) 

247.76 249.30 B: where are you at 

250.27 252.40 B: south carolina [noise] i've 

251.62 254.05 A: yeah how about that [laughter] 

253.14 261.78 B: i've a friend down in south carolina when she [noise] moved but that was ten years ago and i've no clue where she's at now because we kind of lost con- contact but uh 

254.21 255.42 A: it's amaz- 

258.72 259.51 A: yeah 

260.58 263.12 A: well we we kind of followed the raiders around here 

262.86 264.30 B: [laughter] 

264.31 267.22 B: and we follow the minnesota twins [laughter] 

266.20 277.35 A: i can appreciate that i have some real good friends who were there and followed those but you know there there's the salaries they're getting and the and then they they just kind of take it for granted they can do whatever they want to they're like spoiled kids sometimes aren't they 

269.53 271.60 B: [laughter] 

276.62 279.92 B: [noise] [noise] i agree because if you really watch them 

280.15 287.56 B: um they happen to be in what we call it's called like a megamall it's a it's a great big mall of america thing 

287.18 288.40 A: right yes 

287.99 295.21 B: and when they get to this they think nothing of walking in and paying three thousand dollars for an armani suit 

295.54 301.61 B: [noise] it's like if reality were to really hit them and [noise] make them realize that they can only afford a two hundred dollar suit [noise] 

302.23 306.42 B: you know i just think they've too much money and and they're just so greedy 

306.61 310.84 A: yeah yeah i think that i don't think they realize you know how much money they make 

308.10 309.06 B: (( [noise] )) 

311.11 317.84 A: they waste so much they don't realize that there's real money there that you know that could that could be put to use and help themselves later on and other people too 

312.98 314.98 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

316.86 326.34 B: [noise] yeah [noise] i agree with them endorsing other things like um different you know little childr- helping little children and things like that [noise] 

319.33 320.19 A: but then 

326.21 332.45 B: but that can also get carried away because basically what they want is they want their picture and the fame all over t._v. 

326.34 327.08 A: yeah 

332.69 344.63 A: yeah well yeah i would you know i think um from everything i've heard and read about michael jordan he might be an exception to the rule he might make a really genuinely honest with and people you know in wanting to do those things 

341.03 342.76 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

343.81 345.47 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

344.82 358.44 A: but there're so many other who they only you're right they all they want to do is endorse themselves so they can get their picture out there and and make more money but yeah i think the audacity of going on a strike and would you know when they have that much money they're already making is is just 

346.47 347.77 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

358.88 360.77 A: it's just is too much [laughter] 

359.06 359.87 B: it's 

360.10 362.13 B: yeah i agree 

360.95 361.82 A: yeah 

361.97 363.80 A: (( yeah i )) 

362.77 368.62 B: because they they don't mean to be [noise] [laughter] strutting their stuff you could say [laughter] 

368.48 369.77 A: (( think yeah )) 

369.15 370.49 B: this is just 

371.20 375.15 B: okay so a few of them may have talent [noise] but i don't think they have that much talent 

374.50 376.62 A: [laughter] 

375.70 381.54 B: not any more than [laughter] the joe average just 'cause he can hit a ball but then you know there are things with 

377.31 378.85 A: (( yeah i used yeah )) 

382.16 389.16 B: different sports like in a gymnast you really do need years of practice i don't know maybe the years of practice in ball is [noise] [noise] 

388.51 398.91 A: yeah i guess they all need their background behind them you know but i think they just they get carried away once they reach the top level up there and and they i think they believe that they're so far above everyone else that it doesn't matter what they do 

394.87 396.39 B: (( [noise] )) 

398.60 404.31 B: yeah kind of like well for us it was kirby puckett i mean he was the big guy you know and made big ball and big 

404.50 407.32 B: and now look at him he's in divorce and 

407.42 411.36 B: [laughter] umpteen number of women it's hey like hello [laughter] 

410.81 415.19 A: yeah [laughter] had they taken some of that money and put it aside they'd have been in good shape now wouldn't they 

414.93 418.86 B: yeah they wouldn't be losing their multi million dollar homes 

418.21 425.92 A: right yeah but it it makes you wonder if they're making you know ten million dollars you know a year and they've got a two million dollar home why don't they pay the home off 

419.14 420.54 B: but [noise] 

425.85 435.69 B: yeah what do they honest i'd like to know what they honestly spend their money on do i mean do they have to pay their own travel when they go to all those different games i mean is that where they [noise] 

426.64 428.60 A: [laughter] or they go on strike no 

435.41 443.09 A: no that's part of the team expense i'm sure that's covered their salary is is their money whatever they say they make they you know they're uh that's theirs 

438.28 438.85 B: (( mm )) 

443.13 444.80 B: yeah that's really 

443.78 448.58 A: i just think they're careless with it and like you say then they have the audacity to go on strike and ask for more 

448.33 449.29 B: (( yeah i )) 

449.46 450.56 A: i think they're 

449.49 454.30 B: mean do you ever notice how they they never ask for more health benefits or anything like that 

454.44 455.53 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

454.52 461.18 B: they they uh they ask for more money in my pocket [noise] 'cause i can't live well is it drugs 

458.41 459.24 A: right 

461.51 467.80 A: yeah yeah a lot of them are you know i i really don't know where they waste of it obviously they're not using it wisely 

466.78 469.64 B: [noise] no obviously not 

468.02 468.78 A: (( yeah )) 

469.36 473.94 A: i think the best thing we did that year they baseball went on strike was just to cancel the season 

473.75 476.26 B: [noise] yeah [noise] 

474.27 474.94 A: yeah 

475.07 477.45 A: yeah said well you know we ju- we just won't go 

477.25 486.14 B: make 'em think about it 'cause you know technically we never went to any games that year i don't think i don't think we yeah we went to the little league's little kids stuff 

478.73 480.16 A: (( you yeah yeah )) 

482.56 483.32 A: yeah 

485.89 487.10 A: (( right yeah )) 

486.47 490.40 B: that kind of thing but no we get uh 

488.83 489.81 A: (( yeah i )) 

490.49 494.08 B: we get to at least one game a year big game anyway 

494.54 499.62 A: yeah well that it's always fun to do those but you know when you if you let how many children do you have 

499.11 500.13 B: (( [noise] [noise] just one )) 

499.99 509.62 A: just one well that's uh that's that's a hundred and fifty dollars and and two hundred dollars by the time you buy cokes and hot dogs and stuff you spend two hundred dollars for three people to go to a game [noise] 

500.40 501.32 B: (( [noise] )) 

509.82 513.53 B: yeah and for us it's the drive time plus it's the hotel fee 

512.47 527.37 A: oh yeah sure oh yeah so now you're talking about to go to that's the same way for us we had to drive over to atlanta we're four hours away from atlanta and i'd i'd have to drive four hours and then spend the whole night in the hotel and then see the game and then turn around and come back the next day you know you're talking about two or three hundred dollars 

515.78 516.89 B: (( [noise] )) 

518.72 521.06 B: [noise] yeah 

527.37 530.75 A: just for a you know that that's seem all expensive to me 

530.31 535.80 B: well for us it's a mini vacation i mean that's that's the only [noise] way i can look at it but if 

534.76 537.46 A: yeah you have to justify that don't ya [laughter] 

536.60 548.81 B: yeah 'cause if i don't otherwise a fifty six dollar ticket i mean the other night when we just went the fifty six dollars covered it was dairy queen night or something the ice cream stores were having a special 

547.72 549.27 A: oh yeah right [noise] 

548.86 556.57 B: and we had like a personal personal pan pizza of our choice and we got like a pop but then we got like a championship 

556.83 560.19 B: baseball cap kind of thing with it you know for the first 

560.45 570.68 B: thousand people through the door or something like that i mean yeah we we came out with a hat but i mean [laughter] it was championship from like two thousand or something you know it wasn't

565.94 567.30 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

570.70 572.70 B: wasn't even a new hat [laughter] 

572.55 577.84 A: yeah that's that's how they bribe you to come in to justify their charging the price they do 

577.50 578.45 B: (( right )) 

578.34 582.10 A: yeah you know if they would just lower the prices you could go anyway couldn't you 

582.12 585.85 B: well we'd go out more often i could could guarantee you that 

584.12 587.33 A: (( yeah like yeah see more than one game a year right yeah )) 

586.67 589.40 B: yeah but fifty six dollars 

587.59 588.43 A: yeah 

589.51 595.53 B: a you know when they break that down and the stands were were full i mean there was a lot of people there 

593.57 594.45 A: oh yeah 

595.31 596.32 A: yeah 

596.19 599.95 B: but i don't know what a season pass would cost and then all the scalpers that are
