111.12 112.84 A: (( mhm )) 

114.15 115.85 B: but 

115.18 119.85 A: it's what they have to do i guess we have to get used to it other countries are already used to it so 

119.96 125.78 B: do you think it's like a matter of time before they like lighten it up again and stuff starts happening again or 

122.41 123.08 A: (( [noise] )) 

125.02 126.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh )) 

126.00 129.66 B: do you think they're gonna stick to it for a while 'cause it seems like 

128.53 138.23 A: i see it come and go actually some days it's worse [noise] i mean somedays it's seems to be full bore and other days [noise] it doesn't seem to be at all [noise] [noise] 

130.79 132.41 B: yeah 

138.16 142.23 B: yeah we're we're still at um you know orange alert i think right 

141.64 142.88 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

142.56 145.89 B: so yeah and and i usually i see like 

146.01 158.83 B: things like happen like security like tightens up for a while but i don't know at least in california it seems like people get lazy and they kinda lay it lay off for a while and you know things kinda get more 

157.32 161.31 A: [noise] [mn] no you're right [lipsmack] uh it [noise] even happens in new york city so 

161.06 162.72 B: yeah 

161.99 166.14 A: [noise] but w- there's a lot of [noise] things we in new york city we don't hear about 

166.28 179.82 A: and then when i get off the boat i notice the whole parking lot full [noise] of security and police and national guard then then when you [noise] kinda know there was some kind of [noise] alert [noise] internal alert that the public doesn't know about [noise] 

166.33 167.01 B: (( mm )) 

177.15 177.94 B: yeah 

180.22 187.52 B: yeah i'm personally i'm i'm kinda worried that since this this whole war thing that we're at more risk now 

187.15 190.60 A: (( oh yeah [noise] definitely )) 

188.38 189.35 B: and 

190.01 199.34 B: um i would think that that at least for a while that security would would definitely need to be a lot tighter because of everything that we just went over there and did 

190.67 192.37 A: (( [noise] )) 

194.57 198.42 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] oh yeah yeah
