78.09 79.53 A: (( right )) 

79.46 93.69 A: but yeah i mean w- with the amount of money they're making a- a- and based on the simple fact that it that it's us that's paying their salaries when you get quite frankly get right down to it i think it's ridiculous i mean e- especially you know i've got i've got kids and how do you explain to to a kid what um uh d- you know their heroes

103.95 105.32 A: right [sigh] 

106.20 119.77 A: yeah i i was just uh just online reading some different different uh salary bonuses that some of these football players have just signed for [sigh] i mean you got guys there signing for ten million dollar bonuses i mean how much how much money do you absolutely have to make you know [noise] 

112.90 114.22 B: oh yes 

116.17 117.47 B: (( that's incr- that's )) 

118.78 125.87 B: i mean i [laughter] some of the things let me tell you one of one of the worst i happen to have worked for one of the one of the owners

127.62 130.83 B: not a name o- not not a big name you'd know but anyway 

130.64 138.96 B: so i was talking with him one day about it he s- they were saying about uh baltimore you know all ruining things and all that you know the the franchise went for so much money and all that 

138.77 147.51 B: i think it was like three and a half what am i saying thirty five million three hundred and fifty million something like that some ridiculous price that uh that uh angeles paid for it and uh 

144.00 144.94 A: (( [noise] right )) 

147.68 149.67 B: [mn] they were talking about this and later on 

149.71 154.41 B: i got him in a discussion and i said listen i see what what's his name uh jerry uh 

154.60 157.12 B: you know who i mean runs the white sox 

157.07 170.34 B: jerry oh i can't think of it anyway th- the front guy he also owns the bulls yeah both of them and anyway i says look what he i said look what he does he hired what was the guy that was such a high f- albert was it albert bell 

158.93 160.27 A: (( i can't do it [noise] )) 

161.35 162.55 A: (( right )) 

170.51 181.52 B: you know that he put he came to baltimore for a while yeah but he went from pittsburgh to chicago so he went from pittsburgh to chicago they hired him for ten million dollars 

170.74 172.78 A: yeah yeah yeah albert bell 

173.02 175.21 A: right and then had the hip problems [sigh] [noise] [noise] [mn] 

181.47 194.59 B: it was more than the payroll of the entire pittsburgh pirates team i remember this so clearly i had i had [mn] co- and he says i know i know we as- what do you do when we talking in one way and we go another [laughter] there's a perfect example you know 

186.11 187.85 A: well [noise] 

192.29 193.68 A: [laughter] 

193.96 196.60 A: (( yeah exa- exactly [mn] )) 

195.76 196.86 B: (( [mn] yeah [sigh] )) 

196.80 199.80 A: [noise] but uh yeah i um i remember um 

199.85 204.03 A: back in one when the football players last went on strike they brought the replacement players in 

204.15 213.89 A: [noise] to try to uh get the owners to try to recap some of the losses [noise] because uh you know they weren't weren't playing on sunday so they weren't making their two seventy five [mn] for a hotdog and all that [sigh] 

209.39 212.93 B: oh yeah that's right 

213.71 227.13 A: but uh [noise] i just think um a lot of it i- it's completely a- as far as i- i'm a big fan and from a fan fan's perspective it- it's almost like a slap in the face for them to to go on strike i mean it really is if with the amount of money they're making [noise] [sigh] 

223.73 224.86 B: yeah e- 

226.23 231.70 B: even when all of us came up from from making five tens four five six eight ten all s- 

231.59 234.79 B: you know for years and years ago in in other in any profession 

234.58 239.65 B: it went up to thirty or forty whatever when we did well but then i it's not even [laughter] proportionate 

239.29 240.32 A: (( [noise] yeah [sigh] )) 

239.45 253.25 B: the ball players i know 'cause i had a try with the senators when i was eighteen years old they were going to give me two hundred fifty bucks to go down to ab- ab- i hate to be okie but i think it was durham if i remember rightly it was fifty four years ago but any rate and ride around in a bus most of the time you [laughter] know what i mean 

253.03 263.28 B: and uh and that was how much we were going to get pay well i i don't think the proportion has gone that far you know [laughter] 

259.52 266.64 A: right [laughter] exactly a ten million dollar signing bonus and i think i ought to be able to make it to work that day [laughter] 

264.90 267.28 B: [laughter] 

266.97 269.68 A: i can't think i can think of very little that 

268.20 272.60 B: yes well that's if our chauffeur shows up [laughter] 

270.28 276.91 A: yeah exac- exac- if i don't get a- arrested for a drug and and gun charges the night before [laughter] 

273.66 275.83 B: yeah [laughter] 

276.96 280.06 B: that's right yeah 

277.60 284.69 A: [mn] no but uh yeah it's just it's for them for them to not be able to come to some kind of agreement is ridiculous to get all the way to the point of striking 

282.73 285.71 B: [noise] yeah it's oh my goodness yeah and then they 

285.50 292.64 B: and then you know see i don't have a lo- awful lot of of uh o- of great wonderful feelings for the owners too i mean 

292.44 306.93 B: the- the- they do it they'll get every dime they can get and then the players say hey look they've got t._v. revenue and they're taking in you know six hundred million dollars or whatever it is and we getting a hundred and forty million total you know something like that you know and they can see well they get the feel that way well where's the start and [laughter] where's the stop you know 

293.23 294.10 A: (( [sigh] )) 

301.69 303.63 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

306.18 312.11 A: yep yep the bottom line is my my ticket prices keep going up and my hotdog prices keep going up 

311.04 325.20 B: maybe maybe if there really were an organization and this would be starting to be it would be corrupted the day it was started anyway b- b- w- of of fans y- you know a b._f. of a baseball fans of america or you know or sports fans of america you know 

312.26 313.27 A: yeah 

317.27 318.22 A: (( [noise] ))

356.50 366.92 A: that's right a lot of two seventy five hotdogs getting [mn] getting cold i think that's the plan i think that's how we resolve it is we [mn] if we get all the fans together and we go on strike 

361.18 374.96 B: that's r- yeah isn't it yeah you know yeah and everybody and every every ball player's happy to make a hundred grand like mickey mantle made it his height [laughter]
