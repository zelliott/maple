34.01 35.52 A: [mn] oh yes okay 

36.25 37.15 A: okay 

37.03 40.59 B: in my opinion i think they do definitely 

40.57 42.43 A: yes in my opinion uh 

42.74 47.06 A: most professional sports do i guess hockey guys don't get enough [laughter] 

46.81 52.57 B: [laughter] no probably not i i would say the most absurd is probably baseball 

52.76 54.66 A: yeah 

53.42 54.70 B: in my opinion 

54.70 59.72 A: baseball it me too and uh well actually i can add uh well 

59.78 62.42 A: i was going to say uh basketball also 

62.36 64.41 B: yeah definitely 

64.51 68.61 B: i mean i don't i'm not into into professional sport i would say 

69.05 70.02 B: um 

70.05 76.70 B: i don't know i play lacrosse and uh i've been on lacrosse teams in the past and stuff like that so 

76.33 77.71 A: right 

77.36 80.50 B: mm i'm into the more alternative sports 

79.92 81.43 A: (( [mn] i see )) 

80.57 81.59 B: (( i would say )) 

82.48 90.11 A: well you know i i watch basketball every now and then when it when it's when both teams [mn] like detroit red wings or somebody go 

90.13 93.94 A: to the play offs something like that then i'll watch hockey i'm not a hockey fan but 

92.85 93.73 B: (( yes )) 

94.01 94.98 A: but um 

95.10 104.16 A: basketball i've always thought those guys get too much money they don't i mean you play eighty some games there's some guys make what nine fifteen thirty million dollars 

98.49 99.55 B: [laughter] 

103.88 105.60 B: yeah that's ridiculous 

105.19 106.12 A: you know 

106.32 108.69 A: and some of them sitting on the bench [laughter] 

108.71 116.08 B: yeah [laughter] yeah and they're not doing anything [laughter] i i c- you can give me that nine million dollars and i'll do something for you 

111.42 113.41 A: [laughter] funny what 

115.55 118.40 A: [laughter] heck i'll break a leg 

118.20 121.49 B: (( yeah exactly i'll fall down some stairs yeah )) 

118.60 121.35 A: [laughter] and still try and play 

121.97 123.14 B: (( uh man )) 

122.07 126.38 A: so i i don't know [sigh] but you know i yeah i always say uh 

126.77 134.25 A: mo- most sports uh you know especially when they go on strike uh how dare them go on strike when they're already making a million dollars 

132.62 133.42 B: (( yeah )) 

133.92 141.59 B: e- exact- that's part of my reasoning why i don't like baseball at all is that that strike they had um think it was a year ago 

137.58 138.92 A: oh okay [noise] 

139.74 140.84 A: okay 

141.21 142.56 A: (( right [noise] )) 

141.82 147.60 B: and and like there was no team that would play and everyone went on i i think that's absurd 

147.59 157.95 B: i mean how can you dare ask for more money to do something that you en- you know that you supposedly enjoy doing and you're only doing it for the fun of the game 

153.80 155.54 A: (( [noise] right )) 

157.43 159.15 A: right 

158.05 162.95 B: and you're asking for like an extra two million dollars just because 

163.59 167.62 B: you know you feel [laughter] you're not getting paid enough to play a game 

166.89 168.49 A: (( yeah )) 

167.68 170.18 B: i i think that's ridiculous 

169.76 171.03 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

170.38 172.30 B: you know you you could be doing 

172.74 175.77 B: way more with your life than you know 

175.72 177.32 A: right 

176.85 181.18 B: than that and uh i just think it's stupid 

179.26 180.33 A: (( [noise] uh )) 

181.64 190.69 A: that's true i mean you know mickey mantle and babe ruth if anybody's going to get that kind of money it's those kind of guys you know that's the level of the game right there that's the guy that created it you know 

186.01 187.12 B: (( oh yes )) 

188.39 189.51 B: exactly 

191.05 192.46 A: (( you know so [sigh] )) 

192.93 194.16 A: but uh [lipsmack] 

194.52 198.75 A: i don't know it's just uh a money hungry society you know and uh [noise] 

198.04 199.88 B: yeah everyone wants money 

199.71 200.70 A: yeah 

200.04 205.29 B: everyone i i mean i want money you want money hey who doesn't 

203.72 215.19 A: yeah i work hard i got all these kids and stuff six kids [laughter] you know my goodness hey i'll play uh a thousand games i- for a million dollars you know and play every one of them 

213.04 214.12 B: (( yeah )) 

215.07 219.76 B: yeah [laughter] exactly uh i mean i wouldn't [mn] 

215.80 218.25 A: [laughter] 

219.91 228.06 B: it's just ridiculous the one sport i i can say i actually enjoy wa- well there's two of them i don't mind watching football and and hockey 

227.27 228.62 A: (( yeah okay )) 

228.04 238.49 B: uh i do i do actually enjoy watching them but i mean there's some sport like i just can't fathom the idea of just sitting there watching i mean you know 

231.13 232.87 A: right 

236.98 238.01 A: okay 

238.52 239.49 A: okay 

239.51 241.08 B: but i i don't know 

239.59 240.30 A: now 

241.13 242.11 B: it's 

241.14 251.74 A: well okay what do you think about football now i can see those guys playing six teams it's a very brutal sport sixteen games a year you know y- y- one hit and that may liable to end your career you know 

246.90 247.71 B: yeah 

250.04 260.81 B: oh yeah you're i mean there's so many athletes that have been paralysed just from just from like minor things you know having somebody tackle them you know not even hard um 

253.75 255.36 A: right 

256.35 260.79 A: right right right 

260.93 266.63 B: i you know there's certain instances yeah i might find that worthwhile to be paid more 

266.27 268.17 A: right 

266.81 268.84 B: than you know an average 

268.99 282.18 B: you know player of a sport um wh- hockey also the same i had a friend in college that um his first uh time on the ice you know in a game and he he was uh 

270.67 271.67 A: (( yeah oh man )) 

282.22 295.80 B: he was taken down and you know everyone expected him to get right back up and he actually had brain damage from from the hit and he is i mean he's better now but uh 

295.78 301.80 B: you know it just shows you that you can get hurt at any time you know with whatever you're doing 

299.32 300.58 A: [mn] yeah that's true 

301.97 315.34 A: that's true i i i i like i like hockey now hockey's a fast paced sport those guys the the the drama never ceases those guys really hustle there night and night d- it's a constant [sigh] hustling of their sports so i think that those guys 

306.22 307.23 B: oh yeah 

308.79 309.70 B: yeah 

315.33 320.98 A: you know hey those guys earn their money but they don't they don't get that much they don't get that much

321.92 323.86 A: (( you know go ahead )) 

323.52 328.61 B: i i think that would be like the one sport that i would say would deserve more money 

327.99 330.14 A: yeah me too i agree with you 

328.87 329.64 B: but 

329.98 332.78 B: i i do enjoy watching them and uh 

332.88 343.81 B: i i don't mind going to any like a hockey game here and there it it's definitely fast paced and uh it's enjoying to watch though because of that if there's a lot going on 

336.50 337.54 A: okay 

341.96 342.97 A: right 

343.71 344.99 A: right
