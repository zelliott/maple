52.43 53.48 A: you mean like

61.70 64.98 A: well i'm not a big sports person either how about you 

64.04 75.65 B: [noise] yeah i'm not a big i don't go to the um games at all but i do um watch some some games on t._v. you know like basketball or hockey and um some baseball you know 

76.59 77.81 B: (( [lipsmack] [mn] so [mn] )) 

77.58 84.83 A: i'm more wa- more for watching golf on t._v. and i think those guys get paid what they're worth 'cause they have to win it 

84.79 90.29 B: mhm oh yeah like the woman that just um disqualified uh what was her name 

90.95 92.90 A: uh annika sorenstam 

92.43 95.33 B: yeah yeah so 

94.71 98.63 A: an- annika it's like it's ann i guess sorry 

97.89 99.46 B: (( mhm )) 

98.72 101.85 A: i thought that was great what did you did you watch any of that 

102.11 106.56 B: [sigh] um i just saw like the headlines of it on the t._v. news [sigh] you know 

106.45 109.30 A: i watched it pretty much i i 

109.43 114.98 A: i think that she sort of folded the second game but you know it's a good start for her 

113.73 114.68 B: uh-huh 

114.87 115.89 B: uh-huh 

115.63 120.98 A: uh to me i think that these guys getting these i don't know h- how old you are but i can remember back 

120.96 123.35 A: when there was only a six team league 

123.31 129.55 A: and you know the guys were making like [cough] you know what truck drivers or policemen were making 

129.37 143.85 A: and i think that they played it more for the fact that they loved that game i mean there's famous stories about maurice richard who played for montreal at the time called up and said he couldn't play that night because he he had to 

143.63 155.97 A: he was m- moving from house to house and of course he had to load and unload all the furniture if you believe it [sigh] and his coach phoned him back and said you know well you better get done early um because you're playing tonight and he scored four goals 

155.79 156.93 B: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

157.30 167.84 A: you know and i don't think that kind of stuff happens today if a guy you know uh stubs his thumb on the bat he doesn't play for for weeks and uh oh i think it's taken the it's taken a lot of the 

168.19 170.08 A: heart out of the game 

170.38 176.22 B: well i think with all the new cities you know um building new sports parks and um 

176.26 177.25 B: uh 

177.28 184.52 B: municipal parking lots and everything like that and everything involved with the game i guess everything has to go up you know 

184.32 185.59 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

184.97 192.90 B: but it's really um becoming sports is really becoming um out of reach for like the middle class um wage earner 

192.70 193.97 A: absolutely 

193.14 196.14 B: or lower middle class you know which i am so 

196.30 197.20 B: (( you know )) 

197.97 202.10 B: [sigh] um oh i'm unemployed right now but 

198.16 199.72 A: what do you do james 

201.35 202.92 A: how about that so am i [laughter] 

202.65 203.96 B: oh are you [laughter] 

203.52 208.85 A: yes man yeah as a matter of fact that's why i'm i'm sort of looking into this um 

209.17 210.02 A: uh 

210.32 219.31 A: secret shopping stuff which this is part and parcel about uh for doing second but it this this is my first call i've been to tell you the truth 

212.42 213.16 B: (( oh )) 

214.04 214.95 B: okay 

219.00 223.39 B: yeah this is my first call too i registered at the program this morning so uh 

223.23 226.36 A: i registered yesterday afternoon actually late last night 

226.05 227.19 B: (( oh okay )) 

227.21 228.18 A: (( all right )) 

227.23 230.37 B: okay is there a lot of unemployment up there or 

228.20 228.92 A: i 

230.44 241.32 A: um well see up here in the sports everything is suffering because of this this uh this uh epidemic or whatever you wanna call it so they're they're trying to uh 

241.33 251.03 A: to they're they're giving discount seats to the the to the blue jays stadium and you know they're still nine ten thousand short even at two bucks a ticket 

250.01 251.00 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

251.24 257.73 A: which leads me to my other point when they are charging the regular prices because namely the players' salaries 

257.70 267.72 A: the tickets are so expensive that like you say it- it's unless unless it's a corporation and you know it's a big tax write off for them um nobody can afford to buy seats 

267.81 277.26 B: yeah they're building uh ten new uh ballparks in philadelphia an um the uh the the um eagles stadium will be finished in september you know 

277.34 278.23 A: yeah 

277.69 282.02 B: and then the uh the phillys will be done next year [mn] 

282.07 284.49 A: that's for the fliers or for the baseball team 

284.59 289.29 B: uh for the uh baseball team and the uh football team 

289.14 299.83 B: so the mayor the mayor wanted to put the uh sports stadiums near downtown near shopping and um shopping malls and restaurants and hotels and everybody fought it 

300.02 305.75 B: so they put 'em out in um kingdom come you know way out near the airport [mn] [lipsmack] 

303.36 304.04 A: (( [mn] [mn] [cough] )) 

305.17 312.64 A: well the they put the stadiums here in toronto downtown and now they're they're all saying it was a bad move [mn] 

312.06 316.18 B: well they're saying it was a bad move it would have been a bad move because of the congestion 

315.89 321.19 A: exactly [sigh] they had you know we had i was listening a guy on the radio said that 

316.87 317.92 B: well 

321.08 333.59 A: that they had won some free tickets to a baseball game and he said we can't afford the free tickets [laughter] because on game day if you go down and try and get a parking spot it's like forty dollars 

324.42 325.11 B: (( mm )) 

326.39 327.29 B: (( mm )) 

333.48 334.60 B: oh wow 

334.42 340.59 A: [sigh] and th- that's if you take your vehicle and you know w- on game day i don't know 

340.73 346.86 A: you know what urban area's like down there but around here for about forty miles it's just one 

346.99 359.44 A: big built up area and you can tell that uh there's there's been a sporting event because the traffic jam starts from the stadium and it poured downtown in every road going east and west is plugged for about twenty miles 

359.03 360.81 B: (( oh okay okay )) 

360.02 365.42 A: and you're sitting there for four or five hours uh you know on a drive that might normally take you forty minutes 

364.88 372.05 B: [mn] yeah y- you don't have the quite as much here might be park there the highways might be plugged for about ten miles but not that bad you know [mn] 

371.52 384.78 A: it- it's just not worth going down there and you know it you take public transit well again you know it's note the fastest thing in the world you're talking a couple of hours [noise] when you get in the stadium they're charging you six bucks for a hotdog you know and about eight bucks for a beer 

382.86 383.82 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

384.53 386.05 B: mhm 

385.62 392.96 A: [noise] [cough] so that's what the guy said that he couldn't afford can't afford your free tickets it's going to cost me about a hundred dollars to go on a free ticket 

392.41 399.29 B: oh okay okay well the stadiums here are accessible by the trains so which helps you know [mn] 

399.76 401.07 A: yeah 

400.57 405.78 B: and um i think there should be a freeze put on these um you know salaries maybe 

405.94 408.08 B: um i don't know [laughter] 

407.89 411.78 A: [noise] [noise] well how many millions is too many millions you know you know 

410.45 411.34 B: well 

411.69 425.43 B: if the if the you know if the um stadi- if the um league is making money or the team is making money then i think they should get a raise but if the team is in a you know in the dumpsters as far as making you know making profit then i think they should take a f- freeze 

425.34 435.23 A: well don't they spread that out isn't there some kind of a mechanism where the teams that are making more money put a load of money in the kitty for the ones that aren't making so much and they they sort of draw from that 

435.10 437.80 B: oh i have no idea [laughter] 

436.88 445.33 A: well i think since like the yankees they always make tons and tons of money and they can they can afford to buy you know all the best talent and so they're always a powerhouse 

445.36 453.40 A: uh but those teams you know as far as the league goes [mn] those teams sort of subsidize the smaller cities that maybe you 

448.67 449.61 B: uh-huh 

453.35 461.77 A: know uh that that that really won't have the you know that much of an income base so that they can afford to buy a few players at at least that's my understanding of it 

462.01 463.05 B: uh-huh 

462.96 476.38 B: well yeah um i think there's a lot of northern citi- oh i know for pittsburgh for s- uh for one i'm originally from there that's really not a baseball town anymore [laughter] so i mean i think they should really go to a city that really wants baseball and um 

471.24 472.33 A: yeah 

476.21 479.19 B: you know ch- um supports it 

479.31 480.73 B: [sigh] so [mn] 

481.06 484.75 B: i don't know but they build a brand new stadium in pittsburgh so [laughter] 

484.80 487.03 B: (( i don't know )) 

485.07 488.66 A: [cough] well it's it's entertainment isn't it that's what it boils down to 

488.40 490.61 B: it's money for the city [laughter] 

490.13 504.67 A: yeah that's true but as far as the wages go i mean [cough] they just gave that guy raymond two million dollars for a half almost two million dollars for a half hour show for next year's season you know i love raymond so i don't know maybe uh 

493.02 493.96 B: uh-huh 

499.96 500.96 B: uh-huh 

502.22 503.31 B: (( oh okay )) 

505.04 511.35 A: you know if it's all entertainment maybe the baseball [noise] players and all the rest of those sports guys deserve you know as much as raymond gets 

510.94 512.58 B: oh you get that show up there 

512.58 515.01 A: oh we get a what we get is american t._v. 

515.00 516.83 B: (( oh okay )) 

517.43 522.85 B: yeah um he's only going to be doing that show for i think seven seasons and that's it so i figure yeah oh 

522.15 532.22 A: well d- he was wasn't going to do it what i heard next year because he's sick of it and in order to get him to do it one more season they had to give him guarantee him almost fifty million bucks 

531.92 533.23 B: (( okay )) 

533.46 534.87 B: (( okay [sigh] )) 

535.77 537.48 B: (( well i don't know do we )) 

537.73 541.06 B: how do we do we stick to the subject or w- [laughter] 

540.43 544.47 A: i guess if we've exhausted the subject [mn] we can talk about anything 

544.51 552.62 B: uh-huh yeah everyone's really um you know anticipating the ten new ballparks here did they build new ballparks in toronto or [mn] oh 

545.54 546.54 A: [noise] 

552.29 554.65 A: [cough] [cough] no we've only got the one uh 

555.13 559.82 A: uh we we've built a last year oh sorry about three years ago now we built a new 

560.03 563.51 A: uh [mn] sport center but it's for hockey and basketball 

563.03 564.10 B: okay
