72.97 85.15 A: yeah you know i that's good because you can't i mean you know [mn] it could happen anywhere i think and it you know it just 'cause [noise] it happened to s- hit that spot this time [noise] i mean if it's going to happen it's going to happen that's kind of my philosophy on things so i 

84.41 85.74 B: right 

84.93 90.59 A: mean you can't really uh you c- if you move i mean who's to say it's not going to happen where you move to i mean you know [laughter] 

88.98 99.39 B: [noise] well he was mo- he wanted to move to minneapolis like he wanted to get in the midwest where like you can't bring a bo- you can't bring a boat in you can't pro- p- you can't bring uh 

91.58 92.78 A: oh [noise] 

95.61 96.82 A: the risk 

99.65 102.36 B: you know it wasn't a big enough city for planes to crash and 

101.32 106.86 A: [noise] right right the risk [noise] isn't as high [noise] 'course look at oklahoma city i mean they [laughter] 

106.22 108.70 B: well exactly you're still at risk to 

106.96 113.55 A: [laughter] there's no boats or planes there either but they sure got timothy mcveigh got 'em there didn't he [laughter] 

113.72 127.98 B: exactly domestic terrorism yeah i mean i think definitely it's if it's there once it it's in a thousand times but it's still worth uh it's you know it's a good point that if you change your life then the terrorists have won 

114.27 115.31 A: (( [noise] [noise] so )) 

115.51 117.14 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

127.29 138.37 A: yeah exactly i agree with you a hundred percent there i like just you know we give in to them and they've won they've they've ac- accomplished their goal and you know [noise] for us to live in fear [noise] especially with all our technology and all you know everything we're 

138.44 140.08 A: that we have here in the u._s. 

140.15 145.66 A: (( [noise] uh you know it's crazy to [noise] to let them win so [noise] [noise] [noise] right um you know it's whenever we go up )) 

144.42 148.17 B: exactly [lipsmack] so i think that um 

148.63 152.24 B: you know even despite living in the district i [sigh] 

152.36 157.03 B: no because i live here obviously my life has changed all 

154.76 156.64 A: (( to code orange [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

157.45 158.69 B: (( the you )) 

158.94 159.71 B: (( know )) 

159.91 162.22 B: (( all the metro )) 

162.29 172.75 B: uh people have you know wear like these high visibility vests and there's you know metro cops going around with german shepherds and uh it's 

166.62 168.67 A: right 

171.97 179.01 A: that's got to be kinda freaky i mean i i think i you know i think that would would scare me more so [laughter] tha- you know [noise] that like uh 

179.06 186.92 A: being at that level even though it's just a test and a drill to see how ready they are [noise] i mean they had [noise] one just recently here i- in seattle as well where they they 

186.95 188.47 A: they um [noise] 

188.83 195.00 A: faked a car bomb and and put us on high alert and [noise] everything and that was kinda it was kinda spooky i mean you know i- 

195.39 197.42 A: i- uh it it spooked me anyway 

198.48 199.41 B: yeah 

198.59 208.16 A: [noise] other than that i haven't really changed my life you know my lifestyle [mn] you know i haven't haven't really had the opportunity to to go on vacation to need to fly any place i'm getting ready to go um 

208.46 212.47 A: up to canada [mn] nex- not this weekend but the next weekend 

212.59 226.16 A: and so i'm kinda curious to see you know how wha- what the security is like and stuff we're going to go up on a train [noise] so we're not flying or anything but i'm [noise] sure they'll still have heightened security on that as well just 'cause we're going to another country [noise] so it'll be kinda interesting to see 

223.94 224.83 B: right 

226.05 228.49 A: (( [noise] but other than that i haven't really changed my life )) 

227.26 231.29 B: and weren't there s- weren't some of the uh terrorists didn't they come through through canada [noise] [noise] 

230.58 245.19 A: [mn] yes yes they did [noise] and that's that's why i'm wondering [laughter] [noise] you know i'm i'm kinda curious to see what the what it's going to be like i know that when we made the [noise] reservation they said that i would need my birth certificate as well as my um [noise] my state i. d. you know driver's [noise] license so 

244.69 246.32 B: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

245.77 255.96 A: uh that's why it's actu- we aren't going soo- sooner because i have to send back to colorado where i'm from to get my birth certificate [noise] 'cause i don't have one i don't have a birth certificate and a passport would take longer to get so 

256.38 259.26 B: oh wow well i i guess you have to get another copy 

259.19 268.89 A: yeah yeah i have to send to like to the county where i was born or or something [noise] but but yeah that's tough other than that i haven't really cha- [noise] have you changed your lifestyle at all other than you know maybe being more aware or 

268.19 277.84 B: [noise] no i i really haven't i mean not because of the necessarily those attacks the move obviously from florida to the district is uh 

278.12 282.79 B: [noise] has changed my life just because you know a changing there but 

280.67 282.87 A: [noise] right different 

282.84 283.93 B: um 

284.92 288.89 B: you know that's was just pretty much forced upon me i didn't do it myself [noise] 

287.09 293.62 A: yeah exactly now did you move to washington d._c. for business or you got a job or family or 

293.26 296.38 B: uh yeah actually i work for the united states congress 

295.90 297.61 A: oh okay cool 

298.54 300.36 A: well that must be interesting 

301.02 308.96 A: that must be interest- you have kinda of a little uh probably a little more knowledge of things maybe that are going on than than you know the average [noise] man on the street like myself so 

301.30 302.10 B: (( [noise] )) 

305.53 306.25 B: (( [noise] )) 

307.87 312.41 B: [noise] yeah which is which can be good and bad 

309.91 311.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

313.09 314.28 B: um 

314.32 315.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

314.38 319.09 B: though do you know if any of your family members have changed their lifestyles 

318.40 332.19 A: um not really but my [noise] my family is is like from the west and stuff so i mean colorado i mean th- i guess the risk is pretty high there too be- you know it's you know the the air force academy and all that down in colorado springs but they're on the west slopes 

332.14 338.03 A: um but no as far as far as i know they haven't they haven't really changed their lifestyles in any um [noise] 

339.07 352.10 A: [mn] maybe be- a little more aware like when we travel and stuff i think you know when you you notice it because of the the heightened security at the airports you know [noise] i think they should have done that all along [noise] i mean they seem to have taken something seem to have seem to have taken uh 

349.11 357.06 B: [noise] [noise] absolutely absolutely you know israel's been under that type of security for pretty much since they became a country a nation exactly 

355.52 361.99 A: right yeah i mean 'cause i remember like uh [noise] this was several years ago like four years ago or something 

361.80 371.58 A: [lipsmack] i li- i lived in denver [noise] and i would go up on the weekends and [noise] and help my dad [noise] he worked uh he was like in charge of [noise] baggage and loading and unloading the planes 

371.39 384.31 A: at a real small airport in eagle eagle county airport and uh i just went up on the weekends working [noise] part time for him and i know [noise] i would go up [noise] there and i was able to [noise] to go in and with no badge or no nothing only because my you know they knew who i was [noise] 

383.92 385.11 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

384.12 387.88 A: [noise] but i was i now that i think about it i'm really amazed [noise] 

386.50 390.44 B: well you know those people keep on keep on changing there's no like se- 

390.48 395.22 B: you know you have to check everybody even if even if you think you've met them before you know 

394.82 408.45 A: uh-huh and yeah that's why yeah that's what i'm saying when i was with him i now that i think back at it i was amazed at how [noise] free [noise] i was able to how freely [noise] i could come and go in [noise] into the [noise] the baggage handling area you know what i mean it was a small airport but that shouldn't 

408.24 411.00 A: make it any less secure than a m- a major one 

410.15 414.28 B: well you know i think they're gonna i think they're gonna start out at small airports maybe 

413.69 427.68 A: well yeah i mean that would you know it that would be the the [noise] smartest way to do it if they really wanted you know and i hate to say that but i mean that would be the way to do it because i think they're they're a little a lot more lax in security and stuff at those smaller places like that i mean this was 

426.71 435.76 B: start out a you know maybe get a get some security passes at the small airport they have to go to a large airport to get the if they're going to do a plane thing again 

435.08 436.92 A: right 

435.82 439.23 B: 'cause they have to get the jumbo jets that have a lot of fuel 

437.33 449.23 A: [noise] yeah [noise] yeah i know a lot of people have actually you know like stopped flying and stuff just because of uh you you know you can't hi- like like you said [mn] then then they've won because they [noise] they've scared us into 

449.07 454.45 A: you know they've intimidated us into changing our lives and and and not doing the things that we would normally do [noise] so 

455.49 460.61 A: i [lipsmack] i think that you know by [noise] not changing anything w- [noise] you know the- then then they've lost so 

460.82 474.03 A: you know i do- i don't want to like give them that opportunity to to say that they've scared me or intimidated me into not wanting to travel or not wanting to fly or i mean you know or not even wanting to [noise] to catch a train like [noise] i'm catching a train up to canada you know what i mean that's 

473.98 480.80 A: that'd be crazy to [noise] to let them intimidate me into not going someplace or staying at home just because i'm afraid or you know 

483.08 491.29 B: well yeah i agree a hundred percent now do you think that the uh you know some people think [lipsmack] u._s. foreign policy has caused this 

491.84 492.89 B: um 

493.51 496.56 B: you know that foreign policy 

494.91 496.97 A: [noise] the hatred yeah [noise] 

496.74 498.64 B: you know that has 

498.71 500.06 B: basically 

500.33 505.81 B: made the united states hated by the rest of the world and that's what causes people to come over here and do that 

505.21 506.95 A: right you know 

505.90 508.07 B: how do you feel about that assertion [noise] [noise] 

507.13 518.38 A: [noise] i in a way i in a way i kind of agree you know i mean there's there's kinda like the the [noise] this recent war i mean [noise] i i think that uh half of the po- half of the u._s. population 

518.49 525.10 A: [mn] didn't even realize what we were over there for i mean we you know i it wasn't real clear and concise as to why we were there [noise] 

523.58 527.84 B: [noise] more than more than half of the u._s. population supported the war in iraq 

527.86 536.34 A: [noise] yeah i and ha- and the other half i mean we're like myself we're just kinda confu- i mean why why were we really over there other than to oust saddam [noise] 

536.47 538.21 A: (( you know i mean [noise] )) 

537.22 547.41 B: which is which i mean that's that that was the stated reason that we ne- we needed regime change because that was an unsafe regime and uh it was and he was not abiding by 

547.64 552.74 B: he had kicked out the u._n. inspectors which was part of the deal i mean if you're not going to adhere to uh 

547.74 548.55 A: other 

553.17 556.11 B: if you're kept in power by a deal 

555.06 566.62 A: then you need to follow the rules right right uh yeah it was just kinda it was it's i'm glad it was over quickly and tha- and you know casualties weren't too bad they could have been a lot worse 

556.43 558.82 B: then you need to follow the rules exactly 

566.64 580.97 A: i guess you know and i'm just glad it was over but it just it ended as quickly as it began i mean i was like boom boom yeah i i do because it yeah like i say that's probably you know because the casualties were kept down we went in we go- did what we wanted to do 

572.08 575.00 B: well we- don't you think that's good instead of having instead of 

580.95 582.40 A: and you know w- 

582.88 592.05 A: it was kind of a a a forced situation i think you know we were kinda forced to go in there and do it and whether [noise] [mn] you approve of it or not you know i 

592.10 599.89 A: [mn] i'm i'm not real political but i you know i i realize we had to do it and and we did it at least we got it done in [noise] a in a very efficient manner
