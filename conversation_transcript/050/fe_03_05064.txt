18.85 19.82 B: (( oh )) 

19.92 21.92 A: uh yeah 

20.78 22.87 B: okay [laughter] 

22.05 23.11 A: so uh 

23.92 26.05 A: so strikes 

26.31 28.80 A: (( would you like to talk about the baseball strike or )) 

29.33 33.87 B: um okay what kind of strikes as in striking the ball 

34.18 36.77 A: no striking as in um 

36.92 40.73 A: not working any more saying that they want higher salaries 

40.03 43.79 B: oh i'm highly against that 

43.72 45.08 A: yeah 

44.49 45.50 B: yes 

46.46 54.34 A: um what other sports do you think that you know that uh baseball's doing it hockey's considered it um 

55.51 58.96 B: football's considered it and so has basketball 

59.06 60.82 A: yeah um 

62.63 66.18 A: well do you think they actually deserve the high salaries they get 

65.49 68.13 B: do i think they deserve that 

67.61 68.95 A: yeah 

68.33 69.61 B: um 

70.30 77.58 B: i think that some players deserve what they receive but in most cases i don't 

77.74 86.09 A: [noise] so do you think that lebron james he just signed he's a eighteen year old he just signed a ninety million dollar a year contract with nike 

86.07 86.49 A: (( do you )) 

86.45 99.17 A: think he deserves that [laughter] well one thing that's always been brought up before between sports and athletes is the fact that they generate so much money for companies and some even 

87.53 88.96 B: no [laughter] 

99.13 104.25 A: say that they're underpaid even though they have a hundred million dollar salaries what would you think of 

103.06 104.90 B: at eighteen years old 

105.23 106.92 A: (( eighteen years old )) 

105.24 109.03 B: sometimes it takes people a lifetime to make that kind of money 

108.79 115.93 A: absolutely but uh there's the obvious you know thing that the businesses are making that kind of money off them 

115.88 124.48 A: um and they say that they actually maybe uh start paying college athletes to do that to keep them in there um 

121.29 122.31 B: mhm 

125.18 134.63 B: well i i i'm also a believer that those kids should finish college before they go on to the bigger bucks in um in their sporting events 

135.09 138.96 A: do you think if kids finish college they would strike less [noise] 

140.99 150.98 B: i think that if the children graduated from college they'd have something to fall back on when their knees are falling apart at the age of thirty three or thirty two 

150.86 158.57 B: when they're football players and they would have something to do and fall back on instead of um you know getting 

159.12 164.12 B: getting the glory as some athletes would where others would not 

164.29 172.26 A: [noise] right but if they continued on in education and they graduate with that do you think there would be less strikes 

174.32 178.42 A: meaning they'd be more i mean every 'cause they'd be more educated 

174.37 176.47 B: yeah i do yeah 

176.75 179.05 B: yeah i would agree with that 

178.79 179.74 A: (( okay )) 

179.83 180.96 A: um 

181.26 183.56 A: what would you think about 

184.95 186.08 A: (( [sigh] )) 

186.52 191.96 A: if the fans boycotted would you support that 

192.39 193.50 B: if who 

193.61 205.01 A: the fans were to boycott these sports for doing that do you support that yeah the fans if they basically boycott and say they won't go to the games any more 

197.80 199.24 B: the fans 

204.00 209.14 B: oh the fans i'm sorry you have to speak up a little bit for me um 

205.60 206.41 A: right 

207.66 210.10 A: okay sorry 

210.40 223.34 B: i really don't think that would have much of an effect off of um that because as far as the um the sports field is concerned i don't think they make most of their money from the fans 

223.47 224.68 A: right 

224.08 224.98 B: i 

225.04 229.42 B: so no i don't think that would affect uh uh would affect it 

229.71 234.01 A: one thing i notice is that i'm i'm from philadelphia originally and uh 

234.27 235.38 A: um 

235.70 244.48 A: the philadelphia phillys there they've gotten better teams [noise] they've gotten you know the big high paying bucks but people still don't want to go to the games 

244.46 254.95 A: and it's been like that ever since the strike of i guess ninety eight or ninety six or something like that and uh i just i've lost the respect for those teams that have striked 

254.56 257.94 B: yeah i'm i'm originally from chicago 

257.91 258.89 A: okay 

258.36 260.56 B: so i'm a huge sports fan 

260.53 262.53 A: right 

261.10 265.07 B: well i mean in during the winter we have nothing to do but watch sports 

265.06 265.87 A: right 

265.20 271.86 B: so um i i've been a huge sports sports fan since probably the age of four 

271.89 273.41 B: but um 

271.98 272.92 A: (( [laughter] )) 

273.69 282.20 B: i don't believe in these baseball i think the baseball players are highly overpaid and i i just think it's a shame 

282.37 283.34 B: because 

282.46 285.14 A: well the baseball they don't have salary caps 

286.13 293.41 A: the league itself doesn't have a salary cap like football and like hockey and like other sports like the basketball players they 

293.68 298.67 A: they have a team limit of money that they can disperse baseball doesn't 

296.32 297.31 B: uh-huh 

298.08 299.08 B: right 

298.52 309.95 A: so baseball's able to give out a hundred million dollars in salaries to one person and it's absurd i think i think that there needs to be more regulation that to keep it a fair game and then 

310.19 321.89 A: when one one team has a lot more money it makes it that much you know easier to for them to win the next you know pennant and win the next you know world series and because they can really afford to keep these people in 

322.09 329.19 A: but i don't know i think that when they strike like that it's just a real slap in the face to the fans because 

328.27 330.30 B: i think it's disgraceful 

330.50 331.06 B: (( [mn] )) 

330.85 333.69 A: (( right um )) 

333.03 335.94 B: because it's the fans that go for the sport 

336.31 337.40 B: really 

337.32 339.01 A: right 

337.64 342.84 B: i mean when you see people out there when you see people having superbowl parties 

342.66 352.65 B: it's the ordinary people that are like really into the games i mean you you might see jack nicholson at every single laker game but that's a rarity to see 

352.48 358.47 B: you know all these big shots you know giving away their money to sports you know people 

357.85 360.30 A: right [noise] right 

358.79 364.68 B: so um and and and then on the other hand they're the ones that get the best seats 

364.78 374.86 B: they can afford the best seats in the house yet they're just getting 'em for being there and showing up and you know probably most likely getting paid to be there in that seat 

365.03 365.89 A: (( yeah )) 

375.18 376.67 A: right 

375.99 383.60 B: so you know i think i i don't know it's turned into a big um show business uh to me 

383.80 393.60 A: right well a lot of things is i don't know it's just amazing how it really can cost that much to go to a game and enjoy it when you can really just watch it on t._v. 

394.12 397.99 A: but you know it's weird i mean there's 

397.95 411.74 A: c._b._s. they pay so much money for the rights to show this i mean i think it was c._b._s. that paid for the uh i think the n._b._a. and they've got it for the next four years i think it's something like nine billion dollars they paid or something like that 

410.85 412.24 B: mhm 

412.33 413.61 B: mhm 

412.68 425.30 A: it's really incredible how much it's really worth but i mean sports they're worth a lot to the economy you know if we didn't have that and they couldn't make it a business we'd be hurting that much more and looking for that much more revenue in the g._d._p. 

425.86 430.37 B: yeah and also back in the days i don't know how old you are how how old are you 

430.18 431.96 A: twenty 

431.15 437.90 B: you're twenty okay back in the age when i was twenty you could go to a game 

439.09 445.98 B: you know and eat popcorn and hotdogs and drink beer and drink coke or whatever you drink and you know 

445.99 447.00 B: you know 

447.03 449.97 B: the mother and father and two kids could go 

450.23 452.87 B: that doesn't stand a chance any more 

452.73 454.01 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

452.93 457.59 B: you've got to spend a hundred dollars before you even get your ticket you know 

456.81 461.83 A: i yeah yeah that is pretty crazy yeah 

458.84 459.96 B: right 

460.84 473.49 B: yeah and um i was fortunate enough to be in chicago still at the time when the bulls were on the um you know to the track of going through the sixth finals and um 

471.50 472.79 A: mhm 

474.19 479.02 B: i had a customer at work that would sell me his son's tickets 

479.27 483.05 B: at uh at you know [noise] price 

482.46 483.76 A: mhm 

483.14 489.47 B: so i got to the ball games and see michael jordan and everybody else play ball and uh 

489.40 501.81 B: you know for twenty dollars a ticket now i thought that was fair and i usually took my nephew with me my young my little nephew and uh he was probably about twelve at the time 

502.02 506.29 B: and we were offered like four hundred dollars for our seats 

506.59 507.15 A: (( [mn] )) 

507.38 511.91 B: and me and my nephew looked at each other like should we 

512.00 514.66 B: and then we both looked at each other and said 

515.08 518.44 B: no way no uh-uh we're going to the game 

518.56 519.58 A: [laughter] 

519.03 521.38 B: and i'll never forget that 

521.36 525.78 A: (( [laughter] yes that's amazing i mean )) 

526.02 528.15 A: same thing happens with uh 

528.42 540.54 A: all the other arts and things like that the scalpers out there and you can pay a couple of hundred dollars to get a scalp ticket and it's absurd but there's a market for it obviously 

530.76 531.90 B: right 

541.24 544.17 B: [noise] yes there is it's big money uh 

544.81 546.21 B: big money now 

548.72 558.07 B: and then if you want you know the like the football like out here in california as you know you want to watch uh you know your home state team where you're from 

549.12 549.85 A: (( when [noise] )) 

558.04 558.91 A: yeah 

558.12 570.65 B: then you have to get the satellite dish or you have to go to a bar that has the dishes and then then you're spending more money at the bar on buffalo wings and beer by the time you come out you're half broke you know 

563.54 565.46 A: mhm 

569.79 572.10 A: yeah yeah 

571.45 579.22 B: so um you know it certainly has turned into a big money game and then las vegas hasn't helped at all 

579.30 580.21 A: (( [laughter] )) 

579.44 581.12 B: now they're betting 

581.52 583.89 A: [laughter] 

582.71 584.47 B: so i don't know 

585.05 587.22 B: what else do you want to talk about 

585.28 587.03 A: (( well )) 

587.50 599.89 A: the thing about the minor leagues you know they don't get paid so much and they don't strike the minor league teams out there i think it's more respectable i think even though they're not necessarily as good they might have the bum knees
