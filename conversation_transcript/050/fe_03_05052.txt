24.27 27.65 B: yeah v- across on vancouver island [noise] [noise] 

26.38 30.54 A: yeah so what are they doing they're just like listening to our voice inflections or something 

29.51 33.48 B: i think it's being taped and then they analyze it i believe or something 

32.53 33.20 A: (( mm )) 

33.33 34.33 A: okay 

33.97 35.38 B: yeah 

35.36 38.72 A: so we're supposed to talk talk about strikes in professional sports 

38.08 39.49 B: (( [mn] correct )) 

39.34 44.27 A: well uh i got some strong opinions about that one [laughter] 

42.32 43.49 B: okay s- 

43.67 46.00 B: let- let's hear what you have and [noise] [noise] 

45.29 54.97 A: [sigh] i tell you um i used to i'm forty eight years old and i grew up loving baseball in the days of mays mantle kovacs and uh all those 

54.81 66.47 A: great players from the sixties ernie banks and whatnot [mn] and as far as i'm concerned baseball took a real dive when uh they first started doing the strikes the players' strikes in like the late eighties 

66.50 68.03 A: and um 

68.33 79.93 A: um and the sport's never been the same as far as i'm concerned the players have lost their loyalties to the teams [sigh] um they'll go just wherever the money is and um i don't even follow the sport any more 

79.52 87.98 B: [noise] do you do you think that the the reason for the strikes is basically money it's it d- it just doesn't seem real to me that somebody's making ten [noise] million dollars 

88.19 90.18 B: is worried more about money [noise] 

89.71 91.40 A: yeah well obvious- 

90.35 100.29 B: but then i guess because i'm not in that situation i don't know what they put their money into you know like who knows they may owe twenty million bucks where we wouldn't necessarily 

92.99 94.20 A: [laughter] 

94.64 95.58 A: mhm 

99.11 104.64 A: oh gee what a what a problem to have is to be able to incur that that kind of debt you know [mn] 

101.65 103.06 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

104.01 105.51 B: right 

104.85 115.45 A: well of course it's about money i mean it's usually what everything's about when it comes down to bottom line but um [mn] especially in business and anything related but um [sigh] you know it's 

115.54 120.25 A: the ethics um get outweighed by the dollar sign and um 

120.58 123.91 A: uh there's just it uh i mean 

123.85 130.85 A: you know okay it was disproportionate i don't know a lot about most of the other sports but i do know a lot about baseball in in the olden days when 

130.67 141.26 A: players were really tied to one team and the owners had had a real iron uh locking on on people's lives livelihoods anyway and um 

141.40 151.27 A: they were very underpaid you know and people like babe ruth made thirty forty thousand dollars a year and uh and that was more than the president of the u._s. was making in those days but um 

149.61 150.63 B: right 

151.47 157.65 A: um it it's just gone to the total opposite extreme i mean there must be a happy medium there somewhere 

157.72 165.94 A: because right now they're saying you know most of the sports teams from what i understand are losing money they don't they aren't operating in the black and uh 

166.02 170.17 A: um if it weren't for t._v. revenues they'd they'd all be up a creek 

170.58 175.86 B: [mn] [noise] [noise] yeah and i can't understand how it could c- c- continue right now with the salaries they're getting 

175.65 180.24 A: yeah i mean and the ticket prices of the game i haven't been to a live game probably in 

176.08 177.68 B: because it's going up [mn] 

180.65 195.16 A: god three four years but i remember you know when i was growing up it was three y- three dollars you could get a good seat at the ball club and uh these days i think the last time i checked like three years ago it was l- almost twenty dollars for a ticket or something ridiculous like that 

186.28 187.22 B: (( oh yeah [noise] )) 

193.34 194.38 B: oh wow 

194.50 197.84 B: well we got professional football here and it's sixty 

197.34 200.50 A: mhm yeah i know football's a lot more than baseball 

197.85 202.69 B: and that's crazy 'cause it's canadian professional football it's not even you know u._s. 

202.30 203.39 A: mhm 

202.78 215.80 B: and and hockey which is [sigh] for us would mean taking a ferry boat across there it would cost us four hundred dollars for me and my wife to go to a hockey game in- including ferry and everything else how do you do this you know 

207.65 208.52 A: yeah 

211.52 212.56 A: jesus 

214.99 216.40 A: you don't [mn] 

215.82 217.18 B: it's crazy [mn] 

216.54 219.62 A: you watch it on t._v. i guess that that's all you can do 

217.63 220.39 B: well that's right yeah yeah 

219.77 223.51 A: or you go down to the local high school and watch the kids do it [laughter] 

222.92 227.53 B: oh well yeah [mn] um but um [mn] 

227.83 239.08 B: i i don't understand why they want to keep on escalating getting more and more and more you hear about some guys signing for sixty eight million [noise] and uh that seems to be ludicrous 

238.61 240.98 A: yeah well especially 

239.54 243.55 B: i think one of the boston red sox players wasn't it that got that or more [sigh] 

242.92 256.89 A: yeah i know well i mean the super stars they may deserve you know a few five five to ten million but y- y- if you're a super star you're getting millions and millions of dollars from endorsements i was just reading the other day some [sigh] 

256.67 267.65 A: kid in college eighteen years old going to the n._b._a. just signed the largest merchandising deal ever of sixty million dollars a year or some outrageous amount for nike or adidas i forget which 

266.51 268.63 B: yeah i read that too i 

267.87 273.07 A: well i mean this [mn] the the the the sums of money are just outrageous 

272.23 277.73 B: [sigh] so obviously if the people are willing to sponsor this or willing to pay it people are willing to take the money 

277.10 278.34 A: yeah 

277.96 286.34 B: so where does it stop i don't know where that where it has to stop for us the fans at at least at my level [sigh] i mean i can't afford to even go ok- 

286.09 289.67 A: well we need a fans' strike [laughter] 

288.47 292.37 B: well that would be an interesting concept wouldn't it [laughter] [sigh] 

290.41 296.06 A: [laughter] but then again they'd probably the actual revenues from the ball club uh 

296.33 301.76 A: are probably only ten or twenty percent of the total revenue the team gets anyway you know 

298.99 306.27 B: i i i'm s- i'm sure i don't know exactly how they get 'em all but i'm sure sponsorships and as you said t._v. and what have you 

302.53 303.36 A: yeah 

306.01 307.57 A: mhm 

307.15 309.47 B: uh but somewhere along the line the buck 

309.51 312.24 B: has to come from s- ultimately some place 

312.45 313.45 A: yeah 

312.49 320.83 B: and ultimately it's coming from us 'cause these people sponsoring it [sigh] have to pay more for t._v. revenues and therefore they raise the grocery prices up or whatever it is 

320.23 323.94 A: yeah well that just relates to the whole economy in general you know i mean 

323.11 324.17 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

323.81 338.19 A: like i said i'm forty eight years old and i remember in uh [sigh] in the sixties when wages were about half about about half what they are now but expenses have gone up about tenfold in that same you know twenty or some odd twenty thirty year period 

328.76 329.88 B: (( right )) 

331.77 332.53 B: right 

338.02 342.05 A: so the whole economy in general has has just gone way out of line 

340.32 341.30 B: mhm 

342.34 343.22 B: so 

343.23 347.60 B: put yourself in a position of um let's say a football player and you go on strike 

347.39 348.53 A: mhm 

347.91 352.69 B: how much are you losing a game some of these guys are losing a hundred thousand dollars a game 

352.21 354.00 A: or more yeah 

353.07 353.97 B: (( uh )) 

354.60 356.64 B: [mn] can they afford to lose it i don't know 

356.93 364.94 A: [noise] well i don't think they can they can afford not to i mean it's a whole union thing and they can't really uh [noise] cross the lines uh 

357.27 359.20 B: i mean i have no idea 

361.52 362.34 B: (( [noise] )) 

363.91 365.37 B: that's right 

364.88 376.50 A: [mn] so they don't really have a whole lot of choice i know i didn't really follow all the particulars of the of how it worked when the strike was in substitute players in baseball a few years ago and whatnot but uh 

377.21 383.84 A: you know the people obviously don't want to put pay to see us patrons don't want to pay to see people we've never heard of [laughter] 

383.59 386.20 B: well and that's right yeah 

386.51 387.58 B: but uh 

387.82 391.19 B: and you guys have got uh professional basketball teams in portland 

390.74 394.14 A: yeah i've only been in portland a year or so i'm not real 

391.22 392.18 B: something 

394.52 401.16 A: hooked up up here but so i was raised in los angeles so we had all the sports down there but i was a big dodger fan growing up 

398.53 402.56 B: oh yeah [sigh] how okay how come los angeles does not have a football team 

403.17 406.48 A: um i don't really know all those versions of 

404.80 407.64 B: we're off topic by the way but we'll get back to it real quick 

406.80 413.01 A: but i mean we had we had the rams when i was growing up but you know i think it had to do with um 

409.42 410.21 B: yeah 

413.03 426.76 A: with the whole al davis and the owner nonsense that uh we're moving down the raiders and then moving them back to oakland and i i never really got the whole gist of why they don't have a pro football team i i'm not really a 

425.38 429.71 B: it just it seems crazy when you think a city that size and they don't have one yeah yeah 

427.85 430.53 A: (( foot- yeah yeah [mn] )) 

431.30 436.15 A: well i think they have one in anaheim now don't they like i said i don't follow pro football at all 

434.53 437.42 B: no they don't they don't have anything there at all no 

436.21 438.31 A: they don't have ana- anaheim either huh 

437.71 440.83 B: sandiego and oakland be the closest one to san francisco 

439.10 440.86 A: (( hm hm )) 

441.19 442.31 B: [mn] interesting 

442.09 443.21 A: good question 

443.15 443.90 B: (( yeah )) 

444.48 458.94 B: but anyway i i i tend to not agree with the strikes either i just i guess i don't understand the problem mainly because i don't make that kind of money to understand the problem [sigh] and i don't understand the problem as far as how the players see it versus the owners 

452.66 454.10 A: (( [laughter] )) 

456.71 457.96 A: greed 

458.77 462.80 A: it's greed that's what it all comes down to 

459.98 461.49 B: well sure it to be 

461.51 462.79 B: yeah 

462.98 464.38 A: (( i don't know [mn] )) 

463.45 471.09 B: [mn] and does that occur in uh [mn] uh unions for longshoremen or whatever it is do they also have greed too 

470.75 471.75 A: yeah 

471.17 472.16 B: i don't know 

472.03 474.21 A: well it certainly sure is 

472.95 477.69 B: and it's just that we see it more because these guys are professional athletes i don't know 

477.69 482.27 A: well i think in normal industries like teaching for example uh 

482.43 485.74 A: sure it's about the money but it's also about working conditions 

485.29 486.52 B: right 

485.81 492.45 A: i mean how you can't really in professional sports [mn] the working conditions you get t- [noise] paid to be [noise] to play 

492.71 493.64 A: (( [noise] )) 

492.80 502.32 B: well that's right i mean and and what are their complaints but you also hear about working conditions with them too as far as their strike [sigh] like i know it's about money but they also put in other things 

501.93 503.89 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

502.69 507.94 B: i have no exac- i have no idea why they are arguing but obviously it's a big issue to them 

507.28 510.86 A: [noise] yeah [noise] well the whole thing's ridiculous 

508.29 509.40 B: yeah 

510.31 521.33 B: well it is [sigh] but uh i know when i grew up there was a famous hockey player by mau- by the name of maurice richard now he was th- probably the best player in the n._h._l. of the time [sigh] he 

516.67 517.60 A: mhm 

521.69 526.08 B: his pension is so low right now that [mn] he can't even afford to live 

525.89 527.53 A: (( [noise] hm )) 

526.48 531.87 B: and everybody's saying well how can uh a professional athlete of that magnitude live like that 

531.25 532.67 A: yeah yeah 

532.08 533.35 B: and um [sigh] 

533.46 540.69 B: [mn] and now it's gone the opposite where i'm sure that some of these guys making sixty eight million a year [sigh] uh when they retire [sigh] i can imagine 

540.76 542.87 A: (( yeah [noise] no problem [noise] )) 

541.57 545.29 B: yeah and yet they want to strike for it and th- that's what bothers me i guess 

545.33 551.05 B: [sigh] it's like me 'cause i don't understand and i guess if they brought those people and let them sort of 

545.49 547.14 A: (( they're probably making a million mhm )) 

551.43 560.47 B: just a whole not only your super stars but just your ordinary people that are on on any particular team and say well why would you like to strike that would be an interest to me to know 

560.24 561.46 A: yeah 

561.50 573.20 A: and then you've got the owners complaining that they've got these seven year contracts or whatever and if the guy gets injured in year three they're still required to pay him for all seven years and they don't get any value out of him so they're 

572.18 573.90 B: [noise] well that's right 

573.23 574.28 A: (( [laughter] )) 

574.41 578.06 B: uh [sigh] yeah i don't understand that either but 

578.45 581.56 A: i don't think get- getting back to your other question i think uh 

581.82 595.00 A: m- one of the reasons maybe l._a. doesn't have a football team is uh they don't really have a facility down there the coliseum that they have that the rams used to play in is so antiquity- an- antiquated that um i don't even think they can 

588.35 589.46 B: (( yeah uh-huh mhm )) 

594.93 599.59 A: do games there and the other r- the rosebowl where u. c. l. a. and u. s. e. play [sigh]
