62.72 64.00 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

63.80 68.18 B: i'm sure living in new york city you probably remember it even more dramatically than i know

79.85 80.59 A: (( uh )) 

82.47 84.76 A: so you didn't really make any changes i 

84.82 87.19 B: i don't think so i mean i've

95.86 99.35 B: you know um i don't travel a whole lot 

96.14 97.73 A: mhm 

100.06 108.81 B: so it hasn't changed my travel plans a whole lot um and when i do travel it's you know if i wanted to travel i just travelled um 

100.41 101.47 A: (( [noise] you [noise] )) 

110.35 112.21 B: so it didn't really 

112.53 116.64 B: didn't really affect whether i was going to fly or not um 

115.42 116.45 A: mhm 

119.30 124.73 A: i uh probably the only changes i made i used to get to the airport 

125.22 127.39 A: [lipsmack] like half an hour 

128.02 139.52 A: before the flight if that half an hour twenty minutes now i get there an hour that's it [laughter] i can't think of any other change that i've made in my lifestyle 

129.98 131.75 B: yeah 

140.12 143.44 A: (( um besides that you know now [lipsmack] )) 

142.09 148.98 B: oh see i live in a fairly i live in a fairly small town with a with a really small airport um 

149.67 153.63 B: and i mean it literally has one gate [laughter] 

153.64 156.22 A: oh really now do you fly out of that [noise] 

155.64 159.97 B: yeah it has commercial we have commercial airfli- airlines fly out 

160.09 163.47 B: it changes every couple of years but [laughter] um 

160.11 161.02 A: really 

163.91 166.78 B: and the but the security is is good so 

167.20 168.29 A: mhm 

167.24 168.20 B: you know 

168.34 170.25 B: they don't check anybody in 

170.67 174.11 B: until twenty minutes before the flight leaves anyway 

174.48 184.46 B: and it's a little little puddle jumper flights from you know here to chicago or here to um saint louis or here to grand rapids or something like that 

174.67 176.37 A: (( oh right )) 

183.60 185.04 A: mhm 

184.74 186.93 B: but you know it's so it's 

187.69 192.46 B: you know you just go to the airport same it's the same thing it's not like if i went to indianapolis 

192.28 193.68 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

193.37 196.30 B: um where there'd be a much longer wait 

196.90 211.55 A: right but even still though 'cause i fly a decent amount even still though i believe that initially i remember it was a big time pain but now i'm it's almost um like before 

211.67 213.64 B: it's almost what 

212.94 216.82 A: it's almost like it was before like i can probably get there 

217.65 227.24 A: forty minutes ahead instead of thirty minutes like i was doing before thirty minutes was like the max that i would get there 'cause i hate just sitting around in the airport 

226.62 228.39 B: yeah 

227.55 232.48 A: but now you know i mean it's not nearly as bad you know 

232.57 234.01 A: as it was before 

234.07 234.81 A: (( you know )) 

234.90 246.19 A: besides that i mean i think initially people were all freaked out about it but my outlook was that i can't let you know i can't let this affect my life 

245.59 252.63 B: it didn't af- it didn't affect my day to day life it affected my emotions more than anything 

251.95 253.00 A: exactly 

253.32 254.42 B: um 

253.73 255.32 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

256.11 265.62 B: and i guess it still does you know today to to some extent it's not nearly as bad but i mean for the first six months any time i thought about it i would start crying 

265.87 269.68 A: y- yeah that was a tough thing 

266.73 267.92 B: um 

269.17 274.85 B: and i never really understood exactly why and i never really tried to understand exactly why 

275.25 276.44 B: um 

275.34 276.24 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

279.80 282.47 B: but that's not it's not as big a thing now 

280.23 280.93 A: n- 

283.54 285.13 A: now you're good [noise] [noise] 

285.11 287.51 B: so um 

290.68 292.68 A: s- so now there's no problems 

293.45 300.19 B: but that's that's really probably the biggest that was probably the biggest the hardest thing for me 

300.25 301.45 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

302.89 306.66 B: course when it happened i didn't have anything to do besides lay around and watch television 

307.07 308.36 A: [noise] [mn] wow 

307.20 310.73 B: i was i'd had i'm only i was only thirty five 

311.13 312.63 A: you're thirty five now 

311.28 314.42 B: and w- i w- i'm thirty seven now 

314.50 315.36 A: uh-huh 

314.69 318.96 B: so i was only thirty five then and i had torn my knee up so bad that i was in a nursing home 

319.12 320.20 A: (( w- wow )) 

320.25 325.32 B: oh [laughter] it was a- it was awful [noise] uh that was the week i got to go home 

325.38 330.60 B: that w- that happened on september eleventh and i think i went home that saturday 

325.69 326.52 A: (( uh-huh )) 

331.16 332.25 B: um 

332.63 333.68 B: so 

333.97 336.97 B: that was right at the very end of my nursing home stay 

337.11 339.14 B: and 

337.48 338.30 A: (( mhm )) 

339.32 347.67 B: you know i still didn't have anything to do besides you know watch television because i couldn't really do a whole lot i mean it was still pretty pretty wrecked up 

346.79 348.74 A: (( [noise] really )) 

349.04 350.97 B: (( um and )) 

351.17 355.07 B: that's you know how i'll always remember september eleventh it will always be 

355.14 358.68 B: because you know always be linked to that nursing home stay 

359.89 361.63 A: (( hm [noise] [noise] )) 

361.21 367.81 B: just because you know it was right before i got to come home it was you know just right at the end of everything and 

369.17 375.19 A: [noise] really hm so you'd have had to sit around and watch c._n._n. all the time 

375.02 376.16 B: say it again 

375.98 378.66 A: you just sat around and watched c._n._n. all the time 

378.51 381.31 B: actually i didn't um 

380.64 381.39 A: (( oh )) 

382.51 387.98 B: really quick in the nursing home i figured out which channels didn't have um 

388.23 394.96 B: play of nine eleven on it like um animal planet didn't have anything on it 

394.26 396.00 A: right 

395.10 407.02 B: um and those were the channels that i watched i wouldn't watch any of the regular channels because there was only so much of it that i could watch i mean i could stand to watch ten minutes at a time 

403.07 404.01 A: (( mhm )) 

405.95 406.72 A: (( [noise] )) 

406.84 407.72 A: mhm

410.57 412.93 B: you know a good part of the day and then i'd you know [sigh] 

413.19 417.15 B: tune to a channel and and find out what all the the new updates were 

417.42 418.54 B: um 

419.19 421.78 B: 'cause i just couldn't stand to watch it 

422.14 428.97 B: you know it wasn't like i could you know could get up and go anywhere or you know like i had anything else to do i didn't have work i you know i don't have any kids 

422.20 423.12 A: right 

429.52 439.12 B: [sigh] you know i couldn't you know go do any of my hobbies i you know i didn't have anything else i could do i c- i couldn't get in the car and go out to eat you know i was stuck in this nursing home where 

439.86 441.92 B: (( you know in a wheelchair [laughter] )) 

440.01 440.84 A: oh

452.59 456.06 B: i tore them almost like ninety five per cent 

456.07 459.11 B: i tore i didn't tear the ones in the front and the back 

459.62 463.62 B: i tore the ones that they don't do surgery on so it took about two months for it to heal

470.77 472.77 B: just i slipped in a locker room

478.98 479.75 A: (( mm )) 

479.57 481.91 B: and no weight bearing for two months 

482.82 485.65 B: it's okay i didn't want i wouldn't want to do any weight bearing anyway 

487.22 488.98 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

488.15 491.80 B: and that was just like the last thing in the world i wanted to do it hurt like crazy 

492.84 494.42 A: i can imagine
