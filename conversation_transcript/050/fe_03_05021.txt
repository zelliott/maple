16.86 17.90 A: oh yeah [noise] 

17.89 18.96 B: no i'm kidding

34.68 40.02 A: oh okay okay i've uh i've certainly had some uh some experience up there 

36.02 36.67 B: (( yes )) 

40.09 41.24 B: (( it's a um )) 

41.40 43.80 B: a very germane topic today 

43.62 44.88 A: [noise] yeah [laughter] 

44.92 46.33 A: yes indeed 

46.32 54.05 B: [noise] 'cause um i got to walk downstairs from my office walk out into the middle of fifth avenue and look south at a big old dust cloud 

54.02 55.29 A: oh wow 

55.31 57.36 B: uh billowing up from 

57.89 59.90 B: what used to be the world trade center 

59.82 71.84 A: [noise] yeah yeah i i uh i would certainly imagine [noise] i i i actually haven't lived up there in in a number of years but uh just based on my [noise] my experience up there i i 

71.94 73.86 A: have to imagine that it's sort of [noise] 

74.25 77.44 A: unalterably changed anybody that was there 

78.19 79.32 A: (( i uh [noise] )) 

78.34 79.21 B: yeah that's 

79.94 85.19 B: that's fundamentally true i guess i used to work right next door to there in the world financial center 

84.99 86.31 A: right 

85.78 91.28 B: which is the building closer to the water from there and my friends friends that still work there 

88.25 89.27 A: right 

91.48 93.25 A: right 

92.18 95.16 B: and they saw stuff that you don't ever want to see 

95.62 98.19 A: [noise] yeah i'm i i'm certain i uh 

98.81 112.77 A: i i've had uh as i as i said i've had some experience i- in those areas and used to live in jersey and and and work in manhattan and uh i uh i'm pretty familiar with the territory but i 

107.87 109.17 B: yeah 

113.00 121.60 A: i i- it certainly th- th- that whole experience sort of changed me but not on the levels of somebody that had that had to be there 

121.60 123.30 B: yeah 

122.37 123.27 A: (( you know [noise] )) 

123.65 125.04 B: yeah it's um 

125.07 128.62 B: i i recently switched jobs like the year before 

128.48 129.79 A: (( mhm )) 

129.13 133.26 B: it happened so i was very fortunate and very glad that i'd moved away from that building 

133.22 135.99 A: yeah yeah certainly [noise] 

134.14 135.46 B: but i guess 

136.24 138.98 B: so i guess the question was how has it changed us 

139.71 140.78 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

140.02 141.68 B: that was that what they're looking for 

142.31 144.26 A: yeah and um 

145.15 148.80 A: wow that's uh that's that's kind of a topic that's very uh 

149.90 153.02 A: uh [noise] it's a pretty broad topic [laughter] 

153.79 154.57 B: (( true )) 

153.85 157.93 A: i i i can say you know honestly for for my part 

158.19 162.27 A: that it the- there aren't many uh 

163.36 171.50 A: there aren't many fine details of how my life has changed as a result but there are certainly some some broader points i mean i uh 

171.68 185.29 A: uh i was a- at at the time of september eleventh i was working for a company um and and most of my job was travel intensive and uh as a result of september eleventh there's the company has gone away 

180.56 181.40 B: (( yeah )) 

185.80 186.85 A: um 

185.96 186.98 B: really 

186.89 190.62 A: i- ye- um you know on more personal levels i'm certainly more 

191.00 196.74 A: uh more conscious of o- of my surroundings than i ever had been previously 

197.00 200.42 A: i mean i i like to think [noise] of myself as a pretty astute observer but 

197.20 197.98 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

200.74 206.20 A: but uh i i find myself paying extra attention to details that i might have missed before 

206.13 210.45 B: yeah makes you very suspicious of people i think 

210.13 214.88 A: yeah yes it does i- it absolutely does and i i very rarely 

215.07 215.87 A: um 

215.96 217.56 A: find myself meeting 

217.65 227.64 A: people and thinking okay this this [noise] person could be a bad guy this person could be a terrorist but i certainly [noise] um i i i certainly do find myself 

227.91 235.58 A: thinking okay what what is this person's background and and how are they more likely to affect me [noise] 

235.64 236.73 B: (( yeah )) 

236.72 237.93 A: (( i uh )) 

238.20 241.21 A: i i i find it interesting that um 

241.30 248.25 A: i- i i i guess that was really one the first time certainly in my life that that um our own 

248.44 252.12 A: o- our own policies and procedures have been used against us 

252.11 254.77 B: yep open society right 

252.87 253.60 A: (( and i )) 

254.21 261.64 A: yeah absolutely absolutely and i've i've already sort of accepted that the dangers of the open society i guess but uh 

261.55 269.60 A: i i do find myself questioning a good bit more uh [noise] some of those freedoms certainly appreciating them more i think [noise] [noise] 

269.27 270.50 B: (( yeah yep )) 

270.66 272.13 A: (( i uh )) 

270.86 274.48 B: and recog- recognizing the cost of them unfortunately 

274.14 278.39 A: yes e- exactly exactly [noise] and there there are 

278.87 293.75 A: are days that i i i i think okay you know some some of the just the the governmental policies that that have resulted from them you know some some of these things are are good but at at what cost ultimately yeah 

294.16 295.10 B: yeah 

294.79 295.97 A: (( exactly )) 

295.74 298.96 B: there's a ben franklin quote that was going around quite a bit 

299.00 302.57 B: and it's even more germane now which said something to the order of um 

302.88 307.58 B: someone who's willing to give up personal liberty for safety deserves neither 

307.61 309.04 A: exactly 

308.66 310.81 B: which i think is so interesting 

310.87 316.06 A: and right yeah and i i i i certainly tend to be very much on that level myself i 

316.22 317.43 A: (( i uh )) 

317.79 329.47 A: uh i'm not at all in favor of giving up personal freedoms and personal liberties but there certainly comes a point where where you have to question how how big a price are you willing to pay 

329.42 330.40 B: yeah that's true 

330.39 333.53 A: i i mean certainly uh i i think that uh 

334.36 343.56 A: the the price paid on september eleventh is i- is pretty heavy although it it in retrospect it could've infinitely been worse 

343.47 344.57 B: yep 

344.36 347.36 A: at you know at at any given time during a 

347.41 357.84 A: a you know full full thrust of the business day and just in new york city there are a hundred thousand people in in those two buildings alone let alone the surrounding areas 

355.49 356.71 B: yeah exactly 

358.11 360.20 B: they were just a little a little bit early 

358.28 359.13 A: so 

360.36 362.13 A: yeah exactly 

362.03 363.44 B: what it comes down to 

362.32 363.73 A: exactly 

364.31 370.58 B: but i mean and maybe and and maybe that cost is small when you look at the big picture of what we've already paid 

364.35 365.43 A: (( and uh )) 

367.72 368.41 A: [noise] 

370.60 371.96 B: for our liberty 

370.88 371.91 A: right 

372.15 376.83 B: you know if you look at the people in died in various wars defending said liberty [noise] 

372.41 373.16 A: it 

376.93 380.13 A: yeah i yeah i i would tend to agree with that certainly 

380.40 390.32 A: i uh i think that my i- in in my own family i've uh i i've seen you know four or five family members die 

390.37 394.33 A: uh in in those various wars and i certainly wouldn't want 

392.90 393.65 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

394.56 397.74 A: uh i i wouldn't want to think that that was for nothing 

398.13 400.23 B: (( [lipsmack] that's an interesting perspective )) 

398.49 399.16 A: (( um )) 

400.07 401.90 A: yeah i uh 

402.49 404.41 A: (( uh a- a- it it )) 

404.48 408.83 A: was interesting to me that i- i- i i tend to be um 

408.96 412.08 A: uh sort of a conservative character typically 

411.93 414.93 B: yes i hear you're you're a downright lefty here [laughter] 

414.29 422.37 A: uh [laughter] [noise] i well i i i have in the past been [noise] been described by my friends as just to the right wing of attila the hun 

422.35 423.60 B: there you go [laughter] 

423.07 436.08 A: and uh [laughter] i uh [cough] shortly after september eleventh and uh i found it interesting that that whereas everybody else was saying okay let's go bomb the hell out of somebody i was saying no wait a minute 

436.34 440.28 A: we at least have to examine the situation more carefully 

439.48 440.50 B: yep 

440.47 441.05 A: (( [cough] )) 

441.53 445.18 B: let's figure out let's figure out who properly to bomb at least [laughter] [noise] yep 

441.55 442.73 A: (( and uh )) 

444.46 453.57 A: yeah e- e- exactly exactly a- and and uh i mean honestly one of my first thoughts was the last such 

453.74 462.69 A: [noise] incident uh was oklahoma city really and uh and that was done by somebody you know who was who was a u._s. citizen 

462.80 470.26 B: yep yeah exactly yeah i'm uh i'm certainly um i'm certainly have no objections to projecting our will across the world 

464.59 465.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

469.11 469.76 A: (( [cough] )) 

470.97 471.96 A: right 

471.07 474.39 B: but uh let's do it to the right place at least [laughter] 

473.63 477.36 A: right yeah agreed [noise] certainly i i think that uh 

477.87 484.94 A: uh i i think that having that understanding and then being being willing to to take a step back and and look at how 

484.99 490.31 A: our own policies have [noise] engendered those those kind of governments to 

490.55 491.74 A: (( uh to )) 

491.90 493.51 A: exist and prosper 

493.50 494.64 B: (( yeah )) 

494.30 502.34 A: um certainly i- it it it makes a big difference i i find ultimately i i i i'm not so much somebody who 

502.55 512.85 A: immediately following september eleventh thought okay i need to make sure that my estate's in order and my will is done and and all of this sort of thing as as did a lot of people but i 

508.72 509.54 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

512.99 514.50 A: i do find myself 

514.87 520.96 A: certainly questioning uh my what had previously been sort of blind faith in 

521.12 523.58 A: in the federal government 

522.57 524.42 B: yeah that's true [noise] 

524.10 526.66 A: so i if i- if if for no 

526.73 538.74 A: uh if i- if for no other effect i think that that you know that's probably the the the minor bit of good that i can see coming out of this i'm not so willing to follow people blindly 

538.86 541.42 A: as as i was prior to september eleventh 

541.44 545.34 B: yeah i think the thing that changed a lot for me 

545.48 556.94 B: is you work under you walk through your life thinking about probabilities right what are the chances that i'm going to get in a car accident pretty slim what are the chances what are the chances that somebody's going to attack me on the street pretty slim 

552.39 553.24 A: (( [noise] right )) 

557.05 562.42 B: what are the chances of terrorists attacking me where i work zero up until september eleventh 

560.90 561.67 A: right 

562.95 563.80 A: right 

563.02 568.51 B: but now you realise that that's very possible it's not likely it's very unlikely 

568.07 569.81 A: right 

568.90 570.01 B: and um 

570.25 575.41 B: but still just the the the possiblity now exists in your mind which 

574.25 585.78 A: ye- w- yes yes absolutely yes indeed where whereas it was it was never something that i had previously considered that that possiblity certainly does exist and it's always in the back of my brain somewhere 

585.99 588.86 B: yeah but you never thought it was even vaguely possible 

588.75 591.24 A: right right 

590.32 594.04 B: or you just said oh i'm i'm a dummy what am i thinking about that for it'll never happen 

594.31 595.56 A: right 

594.72 599.89 B: and and certainly you never looked at the world trade center and said you know this probably won't be here in a couple of years
