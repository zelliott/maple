6.44 8.90 A: uh right now i'm in the east coast where are you

11.36 16.31 A: oh okay yeah i'm just north of there um [lipsmack] you know you know out in new england 

15.71 16.55 B: oh 

17.76 23.77 B: so we're supposed to talk about whether airport security decreases terrorism 

24.66 28.55 A: that's quite a um quite a potent topic actually 

25.40 26.70 B: in the air 

27.98 33.38 B: (( [laughter] i know last time i think it was hobbies [laughter] )) 

31.27 34.38 A: (( oh really yeah this is my first conversation i haven't had )) 

33.77 35.85 B: oh your first one this is my third 

35.44 36.74 A: (( oh okay )) 

36.19 45.35 B: i gave them times when i would be home and then they're always calling and i'm not here and i said you know i really better just initiate these otherwise it'll it'll never work 

42.43 43.41 A: oh really 

45.35 48.05 A: yeah i called myself to see what happened 

45.77 46.33 B: (( [mn] )) 

47.48 48.57 B: mhm 

48.24 50.38 A: yeah but um [lipsmack] 

50.45 55.51 A: what shall we say yeah i took a couple of flights last weekend and i i felt very safe 

53.52 54.45 B: mhm 

55.27 56.27 B: really 

56.49 65.09 B: i haven't been on a plane in in in a long time so i haven't experienced this though i had a kind of funny experience i was i was in um 

65.26 66.52 B: chicago 

66.64 68.96 B: and i lost my ticket 

68.80 69.47 A: (( yes )) 

69.46 76.85 B: and my roommate at the time had gotten me the ticket and she worked for united and she had gotten me this super super cheap fare 

76.63 77.53 A: okay 

77.10 80.12 B: so the only way i could replace the ticket was for her to 

80.23 89.51 B: and i i discovered i was missing the ticket just as i was leaving the hotel room i was with a friend that i had been at this conference with [sigh] and i couldn't find the the [noise] airplane ticket in the hotel room 

89.56 101.17 B: and so i called my friend and i was like polly please help me out so she said listen the only way i can get you the ticket at the same fare that fast is by telling them you have a bereavement in your family so don't you know 

101.29 109.10 B: you know don't answer any questions the wrong way or whatever because this is what they think happened they think somebody died in your family i said okay fine 

109.17 117.23 B: so i got there and apparently whenever you change tickets within an hour of the flight or within however [noise] many a couple of hours of the flight 

117.29 121.67 B: they have to have this special security thing which i guess is probably like what they do now 

121.26 122.15 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

121.83 134.67 B: and the guard the woman made me go stand behind a sign [noise] and open up my bag and she went through each [noise] and every thing in my bag [noise] and it was just like so weird she took me right of the line the ticketing line and and uh 

134.64 138.79 B: you know made me show her every single thing that was in my bag 

138.42 139.53 A: mhm 

138.98 143.87 B: and i i guess that's what they do now more or less i mean or at least [noise] to some people right 

143.37 144.49 A: okay 

143.93 146.58 B: do they do they not do that to everybody i don't know [noise] [noise] 

145.96 152.69 A: well i mean the party that i went with last weekend i mean he's almost eighty years old you know 

152.12 154.05 B: so they don't feel he's suspicious [noise] [noise] 

153.52 159.64 A: oh they they actually um he he was from new york and they actually ended up um 

157.77 158.69 B: mhm 

159.78 162.69 A: what they do um with this particular airline they 

162.21 162.99 B: [noise] 

162.54 163.78 A: sort people in groups 

163.14 165.09 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

163.67 164.35 A: like a. 

164.23 166.22 A: per c. and we 

166.12 175.34 A: g- i boarded with him i bought his ticket you know and then my boarding pass was didn't really say anything special on it but his had s. all over it so i guess that meant 

168.48 169.53 B: right 

174.37 175.70 B: [noise] 

175.24 187.86 A: security so then we went up to the security thing and it's like the same old thing in the past like um you know when you used to fly i always used to take my belt off because i had this one belt [noise] with a silver buckle on it and it always sets the security off 

180.39 181.42 B: mhm 

186.50 188.98 B: [noise] right 

188.17 197.86 A: uh in his case um you know i mean w- we both had carry ons and i guess they must do like a random lottery thing or something like that 'cause 

189.94 190.52 B: (( [noise] )) 

196.40 205.18 B: uh-huh [noise] well i think it makes sense because if they're only going to do this kind of profiling thing i mean 

205.08 216.64 B: you would think that there would be a way [noise] to get people who would not look or seem like a terrorist you know you'd get a woman you'd get an older person you'd get a younger person y- y- you know what i mean 

215.43 216.24 A: (( yeah uh )) 

217.09 226.80 A: yeah i mean i think it's um i think it's a very serious thing and and they tend they take their jobs very seriously as well they should um 

218.90 220.11 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

222.53 224.29 B: [noise] mhm 

224.97 227.16 B: (( [noise] b- )) 

226.88 233.67 A: i mean i felt a lot safer in a lot of ways um you know as a result of this um 

230.37 231.45 B: you did 

233.39 240.77 B: you feel that they caught any people any bombs any weapons that might have gotten onto the flight otherwise 

240.22 251.28 A: yeah it's funny i really don't follow um the subject that closely but did read an article in the times recently where they had these incredible statistics of um you know um objects 

243.36 245.25 B: [noise] uh-huh [noise] 

252.24 258.51 B: [noise] mhm objects that they they kept from getting onto the airplane [noise] 

252.69 255.04 A: -ved which i thought was impressive 

256.98 266.45 A: [mn] yeah and i mean that's quite something when you think about gosh how much of the stuff you know was getting onto planes in the past it's frightening actually but 

266.45 272.80 B: there are also people who are who are trying to bring on contraband just [noise] to test how good the security is 

270.99 272.02 A: uh-huh [noise] 

272.85 279.90 B: i think more reporters than anybody else but i've heard about a couple of people just doing that casually i uh uh i don't know why just 

280.47 285.04 B: because they uh they wanna poke holes in it or [noise] or what 

285.18 286.34 B: it's kinda weird 

286.11 289.71 A: i guess that's kinda like silent shop [mn] 

288.38 290.63 B: [noise] kind of like what 

290.06 291.64 A: being a silent shopper [noise] 

291.18 293.26 B: oh mystery shopper kind of thing 

293.05 294.94 A: yeah exactly 

294.63 300.13 B: [noise] yeah but but those people are hired by the company i mean these are just kind [noise] of random 

295.49 296.27 A: so 

299.79 300.65 A: mhm 

300.23 301.21 B: you know 

301.49 305.85 B: smart ass people who just [noise] want to you know what i'm saying they 

305.42 306.63 A: yeah they are 

306.06 313.67 B: just want to test what's ow [noise] sorry i just [noise] heated something up in the microwave and burned my hand not cool 

307.94 309.55 A: going to happen 

313.79 315.47 B: (( um [sigh] [noise] )) 

315.92 321.05 B: yeah but i mean i uh honestly i've not been on a [noise] flight since then [noise] i've never really felt um 

321.14 325.27 B: well you know like i say i haven't been on a plane since september eleventh so let me not say that but 

325.46 327.37 B: i certainly have been on a plane since 

327.56 333.15 B: [noise] you know we started having our plane hijackings and all kinds of stuff and i've never not felt secure 

329.49 331.94 A: (( mm mm )) 

332.89 334.05 A: right 

333.48 335.62 B: no matter what the level of uh 

335.97 345.76 B: security i've i have felt like my privacy was being invaded it's like okay what are they gonna x. ray and what are they going to see [noise] exactly and what should i and should i not have 

344.90 349.52 A: that's true that is like a gray area like [mn] what exactly um 

346.75 347.64 B: mhm 

349.54 362.53 A: well i mean i think the thing is with this stuff it's federal law that comes into play and then after that if there are circumstances that that prevent the situation from being acceptable to people usually there is 

353.46 354.39 B: mhm 

362.60 370.60 A: a case that's brought into play and that becomes law you know but right now they're doing what they have to uh based on i think it's civil law 

370.25 371.25 B: (( [noise] mm right )) 

370.75 375.54 A: which is what they use for um airport screening you know um 

374.23 376.72 B: right i mean they're not talking about any kind of criminal 

376.50 378.22 A: (( [noise] [sigh] )) 

376.99 378.95 B: well i guess it could be criminal charges 

378.53 379.56 A: i'm sorry what 

379.31 383.24 B: i said i they're not talking about any kind of criminal charges and then i said but i suppose they could be [noise] 

381.06 381.98 A: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

383.33 392.08 A: [sigh] i think so but i mean it's a federal it's a civil or um unit the transportation safety board i don't think they they handle 

389.84 390.64 B: right 

391.69 395.27 B: it's not like it's coming through the u._s. attorneys' office or something of that nature 

393.37 406.09 A: right exactly yeah so it's a funny thing [sigh] it's a big uh a very big government we have and i just h- i just that they i just hope it has uh an effect on the situation because 

400.48 403.76 B: (( [laughter] [mn] [noise] )) 

406.54 410.59 A: you know i can remember when we were kids you know we figured on the j. f. k. and 

410.04 410.91 B: mhm 

410.62 417.08 A: and pan am and you know you could just basically walk right onto the plane once you checked in yeah i don't think they 

414.41 425.24 B: i remember that i remember my my father had a friend who worked for one of the airlines and we went to see somebody off and they just like toured us through the whole plane the plane the lounge the everything 

418.83 419.96 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

425.16 427.06 A: yeah exactly 

425.55 429.30 B: and you could actually see people off right at the airplane and not have to 

427.71 441.84 A: that's true yeah yeah that's right like when we were kids we used to just walk right into the airport you know with my grandparents would come back from florida or whatever 'cause they used to go down there for the winter and there they were and we'd walk right up to the gate and it seems to me anyway but [sigh] 

434.95 435.77 B: mhm 

439.10 439.71 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

441.32 447.36 B: no you did because because now you can't if you're not if you don't have a ticket you can't get to that last corridor 

441.90 443.89 A: (( mm )) 

446.99 448.52 A: yeah mhm 

447.78 450.57 B: even that last corridor which is pretty darn long 

450.22 451.12 A: (( mm )) 

450.94 455.12 B: and uh it it doesn't seem to it doesn't feel the same seeing people off really 

454.66 457.46 A: no exactly that's true 

455.73 460.23 B: you know it's like you have to abandon them way earlier in the process what a shame 

458.48 459.55 A: yeah 

459.92 470.51 A: yeah plus it's really hard to to um to get into the airports now anyway compared to what it used to be well i think there's more people flying than say thirty years ago 

465.43 466.56 B: (( [mn] is it really )) 

468.02 468.87 B: mhm 

470.50 471.99 B: oh yeah absolutely 

470.68 474.83 A: [laughter] yeah that's the other thing but um 

473.31 479.47 B: have you noticed if if the um if the air traffic has picked up i mean i know there was a big dive and there was an increase in 

479.71 485.93 B: [sigh] you know train travel and people driving rather than [noise] taking airplanes do you know if they've recovered from that 

483.47 484.76 A: (( [noise] mhm mhm right )) 

486.00 499.17 A: [lipsmack] well i mean [sigh] i know my family takes a lot of cruises and they say that they're really suffering because the uh cruise ships um from what i hear they're they're doing more what's called domestic cruising rather than 

489.78 490.62 B: mhm 

498.27 500.00 B: right international 

499.46 514.24 A: right yeah i think they're they're doing more of that 'cause people don't want to um go and i will say though i i was thinking about going to indonesia and um morocco this summer i won't go you know because of the terrorism circumstances over there 

500.95 501.76 B: hm 

508.33 509.27 B: mhm 

512.92 514.63 B: yeah indonesia's a little 

514.76 518.27 A: it's a hot spot right now yeah i would be concerned about it 

515.18 519.36 B: mm yeah too bad that's someplace i've always wan- have you been there 

518.36 527.33 A: oh i'm dying to go to the indian ocean you know and just see what's over there you know and the seychelles and the maldives but i just i wouldn't feel comfortable right now you know 

521.22 522.94 B: i've always wanted to go 

523.20 524.01 B: to 

527.14 528.16 B: yeah 

527.32 534.17 A: with that i would not fly into that region so as far as whether it makes it safer for terrorism i don't know 'cause how can you know 

529.38 530.19 B: mhm 

532.53 536.14 B: and do you think morocco is really do you think morocco is really so unsafe 

536.07 542.11 A: well they said there was an event that occurred out there so i wouldn't um i wouldn't go there no [sigh] 

538.72 539.79 B: mhm 

541.22 544.12 B: morocco always seemed like a place that was so um 

544.17 546.73 B: geared to tourists that it was kind of an exception 

546.34 554.96 A: yeah mhm well they have some of the the biggest golf courses in the mid east actually in the east from what i hear but um 

546.89 547.83 B: (( you know )) 

552.09 553.14 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

555.44 565.19 A: but as far as safety i mean i the one big point i would wanna make is that i think being that they brought federal employees in into work in the airports is a major step because 

561.47 562.35 B: mhm 

565.06 577.98 A: i remember reading stories in like news air or whatever where um you know they had these bozos working at the airport and um you know they had recor- or they well yeah they they didn't they were not screened that's right yeah 

572.28 576.07 B: and poorly paid and poorly trained and and not screened 

576.56 586.57 B: mhm but i understand the training they gave them wasn't that much and the pay they gave them wasn't that much so you know what kind of employees are you gonna get in that case [noise] not very good [laughter] ones 

579.94 580.89 A: mhm 

581.35 582.41 A: yeah 

583.68 585.43 A: it's not good yeah 

585.79 593.52 A: no that's right yeah it's just not you know if somebody just gets out of jail i don't think they should be working in security at an airport 

592.96 594.36 B: no not at all 

593.91 596.68 A: no [laughter] that's a no brainer right mhm 

594.74 599.89 B: [laughter] no no i'm i very much believe in you know you know you served your time you should be rehabilitated but
