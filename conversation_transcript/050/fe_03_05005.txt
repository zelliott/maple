349.52 351.89 A: [noise] they don't have to serve a warrant 

351.30 355.83 B: yeah but why do you refer to as that i mean is that a formal name or you just come up with 

354.55 368.15 A: yeah tha- it's the it's called the patriot act yeah yeah yeah and then they need no warrant and [noise] and they could just say oh this is part of the patriot act we think that you're a terrorist or or you know an anarchist or something like this you know what i mean 

356.50 358.33 B: oh really i've never heard of that 

367.72 368.78 B: (( no [noise] [noise] ))

373.42 384.61 A: is like um if you get in trouble for something anything like that that that they don't like they can re- revoke your citizenship on you and stuff like that which is pretty crazy you know like 

384.09 386.90 B: oh wow i don't even think that's constitutional [laughter] 

386.28 391.57 A: yeah w- w- well it is now and well it well it hasn't been passed yet but that's what they're trying to do you know what i mean
