5.59 6.79 A: hi i'm james 

6.93 7.91 B: hi 

7.87 9.80 A: (( hi so we're gonna talk )) 

8.27 14.29 B: so so do you think do you think it'll it helps prevent terrorists [laughter] 

10.51 11.64 A: well 

14.19 22.59 A: well i don't know it it it seemed like well it it makes everybody feel safe i think that's the most important thing i think other than that if they wanna do something they're gonna do it 

14.30 15.77 B: the airport security 

22.63 23.73 B: yeah 

23.10 31.12 A: unfortunately that's just the i mean j- just like breaking into cars or doing anything if anybody really wants to do it they can put their minds to it and figure something out sadly [noise] [noise] 

31.60 33.84 B: yeah i agree but 

33.96 37.99 B: i do think that um it might help prevent some of it 

37.77 49.90 A: oh exactly i think it will ye- ye- yeah it takes care of some of the smaller people or someone like the people that they go a little bit nutso but like i don't know about the bigger organizations you know lik- like if they like the one in pakistan that just happened where they 

49.82 56.76 A: almost they they were just really getting close to uh doing something in the u._s. embassy over there but i don't know 

56.05 64.42 B: yeah i don't think that i know that when i went to las vegas i went there last year in august they did those uh random checks 

64.54 68.83 B: and both my husband and i both got pulled into 'em at separate times and 

69.07 72.64 B: so i don't know that their random cheques are any good but 

72.35 81.65 A: [noise] yeah exactly an- an- and it's weird it's like every every time i've gotten i mean i've been to the airport for numerous reasons in the last year and it seems like no matter how many times i go it's like they've got a new system in place some 

81.60 82.55 B: yeah 

82.17 87.94 A: days it's really lax some days it's really on and you know how how they're pulling people out is kinda interesting 

88.09 88.97 A: so 

89.43 95.48 A: what was actually kind of scary i came i was in the carribean i just had uh my honeymoon uh about just almost a year ago and how 

94.67 95.53 B: uh-huh 

95.39 105.43 A: how lax it was you know to come back into the u._s. or in in some countries how easy it would be to do something 'cause we're doing just 'cause we're doing stuff here in the u._s. 

102.01 103.30 B: oh really 

105.58 112.24 A: [noise] you know some countries they're trying to step it up but it's very it it's kinda scary sometimes what they're what they're what they're letting through 

105.86 106.78 B: uh-huh 

112.62 115.84 B: oh do they just let you walk in with no check or what 

115.43 119.21 A: they check but it's you know it's not it's not the 

119.18 131.83 A: same you know same equipment it's not you know so and the people sometimes they look like they could really care less about what they're really checking and they kind of look at som- i mean it's like they i don't think they really go through too too thoroughly 

122.14 123.01 B: uh-huh 

127.31 128.23 B: mhm 

132.07 132.80 B: (( mm )) 

132.54 140.08 A: and this is stuff that's in the ca- in the in the in the carribean which is like you know it's not that far it wouldn't be that difficult to do something it's like so close so 

140.39 141.65 B: yeah 

141.42 143.26 A: that's kinda weird but 

142.72 145.80 B: yeah they made us take off our shoes take off 

146.10 153.33 B: i don't know just about everything [laughter] not our clothes but like we had a whole bunch of change that um 

148.21 149.52 A: (( yeah i mean that's [noise] )) 

153.53 160.67 B: that we took with us and it set off that the the thing you know how whenever you put your change in and you 

159.93 160.68 A: yeah 

161.28 163.01 B: [noise] getting set it through 

163.26 165.85 B: it set set it off every time 

163.29 164.04 A: yeah 

165.87 166.78 A: (( oh jeeze )) 

166.04 167.12 B: and 

167.13 168.67 B: yeah 

168.12 172.71 A: yeah i i think i've just gone to travelling now in like flip flops no belts 

168.74 169.49 B: so 

172.70 179.59 A: just try to wear nothing because i know that's it gonna be a pr- production just to get everything off through the scanner back on 

179.40 189.10 A: if they pull me aside i've gotta like tip toe and dance for 'em and it's almost better to just like try to wear as limited amount of clothing as possible so you don't have to worry about it 

188.34 189.66 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

189.85 190.69 A: so 

192.03 193.13 B: huh 

193.17 196.30 B: i wonder what it's like over there in europe and 

193.37 194.11 A: that's 

196.41 197.49 A: i don't know i'm 

196.43 197.86 B: (( afghanistan )) 

197.71 202.62 A: i've gotta go over there i actually have to go over there in a couple of weeks and so i'll actually be able to see because 

202.39 214.15 A: i know for years like you can't you know they've had armed you know with submachine guns military people outside the airports throughout europe for years i mean they've been terrorism's been something they're used to 

205.00 205.79 B: [noise] 

214.59 217.87 A: so you know they're so they're a little more 

215.19 215.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

218.10 226.14 A: had to make the front door a little more scary than we are kinda like how we were after nine eleven when they had all the um national guard at at all the airports 

220.96 221.89 B: (( mhm )) 

226.37 227.53 B: mhm 

226.69 231.15 A: um so and but it'll it will be interesting to see how the how they're treating thing over there 

231.15 231.92 B: [noise] 

232.45 234.99 B: yeah i know i used to live on an um 

235.24 239.44 B: on an airforce base over there and every time we'd go on they'd search your whole car 

239.49 240.46 A: so oh really 

239.76 242.19 B: to see if you had bombs or anything 

242.04 243.64 A: [noise] that's crazy 

244.12 245.29 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

245.10 250.36 A: yeah it's kinda weird 'cause i remember like you know i throughout like competitions in my you know 

250.27 252.23 A: through the sports i did in college 

252.06 259.24 A: some of the i mean we'd sometimes stay on on naval bases when we were in san diego and they they were kinda it's amazing what they would let you do back then it was 

259.20 271.92 A: like oh nothing's gonna happen now it's fine but go ahead and you know come on base this is like uh miramar which is where top gun was there was a sub base that we used to go to and and i know nowadays they they won't even let you get near them just it's so 

267.81 268.63 B: mhm 

272.39 273.80 A: it's kinda scary what they've 

273.86 274.86 A: got [noise] [noise] 

274.36 279.89 B: [noise] i remember when i was younger i would say you know i left my i._d. card at home can i go home 

279.93 280.72 A: yeah 

279.96 282.05 B: and it was yeah go on through 

281.95 283.07 A: [laughter] 

283.67 286.98 B: and they would let me i mean of course i was younger but 

283.93 284.70 A: (( at )) 

287.06 288.07 B: still 

288.04 295.54 A: the same time yeah i mean who else would you have being doing that i you know don't say you would but you know they they don't they they don't know what anybody's doing off base 

288.13 288.99 B: it's 

291.18 292.33 B: yeah 

295.16 301.26 B: no and then just recently i went to um an airforce base with my mom 

301.36 302.23 A: mhm 

301.61 305.37 B: 'cause my dad's retired and of course i had to go through the whole 

305.67 307.82 B: the whole checkpoint thing and 

307.98 312.12 B: go get an i._d. normally i wouldn't have to do that i would just get right on but 

312.74 316.55 B: they've tightened up a little bit to get on on the airforce base [laughter] 

316.12 317.40 A: yeah 

317.12 318.82 B: (( yeah we just i don't know )) 

317.66 318.53 A: (( it's )) 

318.95 323.39 A: so what do you think the air force are gonna they gonna think they're gonna get even more security or are they gonna 

319.28 320.14 B: the air 

323.51 331.31 A: 'cause i think even with the sars they've got the new what is it now that they there's a sensor it can it can detect within like a tenth of a degree your body temperature 

331.50 333.38 B: oh really i haven't heard about that 

331.88 335.70 A: to see if you're sick getting on to see if to see if you're sick getting on an airplane 

335.77 336.61 B: uh-huh 

336.58 342.28 A: so i was like you know they're getting really i mean i don't know maybe it will get better and maybe but then 

337.20 338.03 B: huh 

342.98 345.77 A: it's gonna be very expensive for what they're gonna be able to do but 

345.61 347.18 B: yeah that's true 

345.96 346.58 A: (( when )) 

347.42 360.58 A: you think about it nine eleven it was what they they used razor blades and small little things that they could you know it was it was kinda it was kinda sad what what small things they did to actually take care of those guys 

360.81 362.03 B: yeah 

361.61 362.72 A: and uh 

362.73 365.27 A: i don't know what will the next type thing be 

365.51 370.39 B: well yeah even if they wanted to do like a biological weapon 

365.62 366.37 A: but 

370.45 371.82 A: (( oh yeah )) 

371.26 381.00 B: for us you know i mean what if they just infected someone who was willing to die with smallpox or something and sent 'em on an airplane you know how easy would it be to infect people 

378.79 379.68 A: (( exactly )) 

380.94 382.40 A: exactly 

381.82 385.10 B: or to spread it and they can't detect that so 

384.75 394.20 A: yeah it's like i mean th- they can check for bomb making materials but can they [mn] i don't think i haven't a sensor yet that can tell for smallpox or anthrax or any of things 

394.18 394.97 B: yeah 

394.48 395.38 A: (( i don't know )) 

395.81 401.88 A: it's 'cause you know if they had one they'd tell you about it because they're wanting you to feel safe but obviously they don't have anything for it so so 

401.78 402.89 B: yeah 

404.69 406.69 A: (( i'm trying to think of but uh )) 

405.68 407.32 B: (( i don't know )) 

407.39 410.28 A: [laughter] ten minutes can be a very long time i 

408.52 411.14 B: it's just getting worse and worse huh 

411.18 415.14 A: say ten minutes can be a very long time but yeah it is getting worse and worse i don't know um 

414.38 415.43 B: yeah 

416.22 423.74 B: it makes you think 'cause i'm only twenty one years old and i know that like ten years ago you know it wasn't anything like this 

423.59 424.52 A: oh i know 

423.95 426.14 B: and then now 

426.80 429.69 B: i don't know it makes me wonder having a child and 

429.73 431.91 B: i won't even fly with my daughter 

431.86 432.85 A: oh really 

432.47 435.42 B: oh no no no [laughter] no 

435.37 440.40 A: (( [noise] right but it yes there a cou- it's kind of as i was saying earlier take it's new to us but it's )) 

440.42 443.58 A: the rest of the world's been dealing with it forever you know 

442.99 443.93 B: (( yeah )) 

443.77 445.02 A: it's so 

445.10 455.55 A: you know england's been fine they had they had all the problems with i._r._a. bombers for years the french have always had little factions going off in the train stations and airports italians the same thing 

455.35 461.16 A: they're all going strong and you know it's annoying it's like a little mosquito but at the same 

461.82 464.15 A: you know you gotta keep on going and [noise] 

463.87 468.88 B: yeah i wonder what they're doing for like like ship security 

468.94 470.54 B: i guess um 

471.49 477.39 A: yeah that's the one to worry abut 'cause that's probably i mean that's probably one actually i even saw something the other day about how the 

473.59 474.60 B: yeah 

477.41 485.58 A: they're not they're checking the borders now like doing a lot of the ones on mexico not so much for the illegal immigrants but like checking for weapons that might be coming across through mexico 

485.58 486.49 B: uh-huh 

486.31 499.56 A: you know and stuff like that it's like that's my more my concern now is like what happened to all these weapons and stuff from the soviet union in the past like who's watching all the old warheads and do we have do we know of the exact count and where everything's at you know 

499.66 500.61 B: yeah 

500.26 511.23 A: can somebody walk across with some something one day and you know so it's probably not gonna i mean the annoying things the kinda pesky things would be the airplanes crashing into buildings but there's other things that will 

512.07 515.06 A: probably far worse that we should worry about 

515.26 517.80 B: well i used to live down there by the um 

518.58 520.83 B: by the el paso border 

520.55 521.69 A: oh really 

521.13 522.33 B: in texas 

522.41 523.73 B: and um [lipsmack] 

524.71 534.96 B: but uh after nine eleven happened we just to take like two or three hours to cross the border well at least that's what people were telling me they would just wait in line for forever and now it's just really quick 

534.82 535.93 A: really 

535.55 539.67 B: so it's it's gotten a lot more relaxed now that um 

539.92 541.14 B: you know the 

541.46 543.08 B: it's kinda died down 

543.11 551.67 A: yeah kinda it's like whatever the media's hyping is what the security's up and then you know they uh raised it to orange or whatever the color is of that day then 

551.68 553.56 A: it will come if yeah i mean 

553.91 557.71 A: a lot of it's just there's probably just not enough money to to be able to 

557.90 561.15 A: do everything that we theoretically should do 

561.37 562.32 B: yeah 

561.68 565.93 A: (( you know it's it would probably not you know have to change some people )) 

564.94 567.55 B: and it's kinda sad that we have to do [laughter] something 

567.50 570.64 A: (( yeah it is you know it's like [mn] )) 

569.12 571.77 B: that people are out there like that 

572.35 573.62 B: but 

572.67 584.77 A: dreams like yeah enjoy your life why worry about making life miserable for other people it's like i like well i guess in some sense we kinda i- in- infringe on other people's whatevers but you know i don't 

584.78 587.60 A: know some of it just seems so blown out of proportion 

588.57 596.05 A: but of course i'm not over i'm not over in the middle east i don't know how how their perspective is of what we're doing to them or how it's been like that for 

594.85 597.61 B: well of course these people are raised to 

597.79 599.89 B: believe you know what kind of
