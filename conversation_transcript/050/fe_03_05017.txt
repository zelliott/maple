133.29 142.47 B: the dream started out with uh this very rich guy who was flying [lipsmack] uh from one place to another trying to find a wife 

142.93 144.47 B: and um 

145.20 148.37 B: [lipsmack] he got on this plane and he flew into new york 

147.94 149.58 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

149.48 152.09 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] well that's where i lived 

152.26 154.05 B: so he was coming to see me 

154.88 158.67 B: and uh when he got there there was this great big party 

159.24 161.09 B: at this hotel 

160.36 161.54 A: mhm 

162.91 168.04 B: and he met me and everything and but i never saw his face 

169.48 172.60 B: and he went outside 

170.35 170.91 A: (( [cough] )) 

173.13 175.48 B: and he was like on the terrace 

175.71 184.32 B: and he was talking to these men and these men came up to him these were arab men and they came up to him and they asked him did did he want them to carry out the plans 

184.35 190.01 B: of the second thing and he said um yes 

190.55 194.87 B: he matter of fact he didn't say anything but his ssilence was taken as a yes 

195.28 203.62 B: and uh so they left but i saw a airplane being refueled i saw fuel like old cans of fuel sitting on the ground 

195.55 196.35 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

203.48 210.65 B: but i didn't realize this was an airplane until after everything had happened actually had happened not in the dream but actually in life [noise] 

209.95 211.54 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

210.93 213.29 B: and uh this dream bothered me 

213.87 217.25 B: for days and days and days not for days and days and days but 

216.64 221.81 A: [noise] but you didn't dream about from what you said like an airplane crashing into a building or anything like that 

221.11 223.38 B: (( i- yeah i haven't finished telling you about the dream )) 

223.07 224.18 A: oh i'm sorry 

223.70 227.65 B: what i saw was a building crashing 

227.65 238.37 B: and it was going down and dust came up from the ground a big cloud of dust and like in a dream if you're puzzled you know you can't really figure it out until you talk to somebody about it 

238.33 239.45 B: well 

239.24 253.70 B: i couldn't tell nobody because they told me in the dream that the world was that new york was going to be bombed in two days and that scared me it frightened me really really bad this was that sunday night the saturday night i had the dream well it's going to happen that tuesday 

251.91 252.89 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

253.58 257.90 B: and that monday i went to school and i started to tell the whole class about it but i 

257.99 264.89 B: i ventured away from telling them for s- fe- fear they'd call me a lunatic and have me sent to hospital or whatever 

264.60 266.73 A: [mn] right yeah that's understandable [noise] [noise] 

265.77 267.61 B: so i didn't tell nobody 

267.66 270.05 B: uh but i did a tell a girlfriend of mine 

270.25 279.71 B: i told her the whole dream and everything you know so when september eleven happened it wasn't a shock to me it was just what the thing that bothered me was that i was at work 

279.77 285.64 B: i was coming to work and seeing all this on the news and everything and on the t._v. 

286.11 296.31 B: [sigh] i was wishing i had could have done something to prevent it i wish i was wishing that i knew some people in high places where i could have pushed a button made some phone calls and seen everything out 

293.74 295.80 A: [noise] [noise] but no one would have believed you 

296.49 297.74 A: who would have believed you 

297.64 300.30 B: (( who would have believed me [noise] exactly [noise] )) 

300.50 306.18 A: right no no one would believe you no one's going to act on it oh a person had a dream so oh that's nice 

306.67 311.79 A: no one's going to do anything i mean people would believe you had the dream but no one's going to believe it's foretelling 

311.67 312.71 B: mhm 

311.81 314.29 A: you know would have anything to do with what's happening 

313.13 322.15 B: i- a- you know what would have happened i- a- a- the far as i could have got with this was the police department and they probably would have had me arrested for planting a bomb somewhere 

318.61 319.70 A: (( [noise] right )) 

322.44 327.83 B: interrogated me to no end you know 'cause saying new york 

327.91 331.01 B: (( and then it happening in new york they would have came to my house )) 

330.52 336.15 A: they w- i don't think they'd arrest somebody 'cause there's you know there's no indication you did anything but you'd certainly be questioned 

336.26 337.48 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

336.45 337.74 A: as to how you 

337.77 351.70 A: because someone would say gee you must have had you must have known someone who'd told you something or something like that and so you had a dream about it maybe you forgot speaking with the person and you're an entirely innocent person but you may have somehow overheard something 

351.70 352.97 B: mhm 

352.69 355.68 A: so they probably wouldn't you know 

355.91 361.06 A: think that you're a bad person but rather think that somehow you inadvertently overheard something 

362.17 365.04 A: which registered on your mind 

362.26 363.30 B: yeah 

365.81 370.15 A: and then you were disturbed by it so you had a dream about it to express your anxiety 

372.78 375.43 A: [noise] but you would have pa- been paid a visit for sure 

376.48 377.77 B: [sigh] i believe you 

378.99 379.82 A: well 

379.98 383.95 A: [sigh] too bad you like didn't make a recording of this before it happened with 

384.05 384.97 A: (( you know )) 

385.47 389.50 A: some some proof that it was it was made on a certain date 

385.57 387.25 B: mhm 

391.43 393.67 B: yeah it was very scary 

392.92 399.15 A: mhm 'cause that's uncanny ever have any any ever have any similar dreams like foretelling the future [noise] 

399.57 401.78 B: yeah once before i did 

402.11 404.90 B: once before i had a um 

405.43 413.47 B: around the same time i saw these numbers appear now this was this i was awake i saw these numbers appear on the television 

413.67 418.51 B: and i couldn't figure out why did i see some numbers i didn't play the 

417.76 418.67 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

418.72 420.31 B: the gambling thing

419.45 421.42 A: right lottery [noise] [noise] [noise] 

420.88 426.86 B: yeah the lottery and uh [sigh] i couldn't it and it stayed on my mind because 

427.35 430.18 B: the t._v. was on but the whole screen 

430.28 433.77 B: had uh numbers on it and the numbers were in white letters 

434.20 444.73 B: [sigh] and i told my mom i told everybody i could think of about those numbers i told everybody i could think of 'cause it i never in my life seen nothing like that but what was revealed to me about that 

444.90 447.02 B: was that my uncle passed away 

448.01 451.92 B: and as everything is on the number system now 

452.15 453.47 A: (( [noise] right )) 

453.20 458.28 B: when i got to the courthouse to get a copy of the death certificate 

458.31 469.60 B: because at the funeral home my little cousin had rushed down and got the death certificate so i had to end up going to the courthouse to get copies i was sitting there in the lobby waiting 

468.26 469.03 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

469.80 471.94 B: and i looked up 

472.92 481.53 B: and i looked at a screen and it had numbers on it i didn't think anything of it but as i looked away and i was sitting there in a daze because i was mourning

489.60 493.96 B: this was that was and when i looked at looked at everything around me 

494.41 499.38 B: and those numbers came and i'm like this is what those numbers meant death 

501.43 505.11 A: so you saw the same numbers in your dream that you saw on that screen [noise] 

504.26 514.12 B: [sigh] [noise] no it wasn't the same numbers i just saw the numbers on that screen and everything just like fell in place that that was the time and that was the place
