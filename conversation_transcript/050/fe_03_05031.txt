52.23 54.31 B: [mn] wow and uh 

54.46 56.28 B: so you're you're in college then 

55.98 58.72 A: [noise] [noise] no i'm in high school it's my last year 

57.11 58.25 B: high school 

58.38 62.42 B: okay yeah so everybody was watching the uh watching it on t._v. 

60.31 61.40 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

62.27 63.68 A: mhm 

62.53 72.24 B: yeah i was at work and um [mn] they had uh in our cafeteria they got t._v.s and people were just standing around the t._v.s over and over and then uh everybody at work was getting on the internet 

72.84 81.25 B: [sigh] they were just trying to get more and more news 'cause nobody really knew what was going on and uh but has it changed your life at all or do you do anything different 

75.87 77.12 A: (( [noise] mhm yeah [lipsmack] )) 

81.14 83.56 A: i wouldn't say that 

82.42 86.77 B: [sigh] i just yeah i can't say that i do anything different 

85.67 86.88 A: (( nope [noise] )) 

87.52 97.05 A: i mean the most that it's changed my life is i have to wait longer at the airport and i mean i'm not trying to be cynical or anything but it's just about it [sigh] 

91.28 92.51 B: that's uh that's 

93.67 98.82 B: it's uh yeah it's kinda added a little bit of inconvenience to our life if anything 

97.77 99.46 A: (( yeah )) 

98.78 102.30 B: the thing that kinda disturbed me most about that is i think if uh 

102.26 106.06 B: if uh terrorists are going to strike again they're probably going to do it in uh 

105.84 120.28 B: [lipsmack] not not using the airlines so you know a- a- and we're diverting all of our attention to the airlines and airports and security and everything and i think the next one's going to be like a tank truck or something completely catching us off guard 

108.17 110.73 A: right right right [laughter] 

116.84 118.27 A: (( i )) 

118.57 119.38 A: they 

120.41 127.36 A: [noise] there's [mn] i think they just did that to appease the society you know just to make us feel safer 

127.69 130.59 A: i think that's the whole reason they did the airport security 

130.29 131.97 B: right 

130.71 131.27 A: (( [noise] )) 

131.04 138.64 A: i mean 'cause if something something bad happened in one area you you patch that up and make it seem like it's okay now and and even if 

137.01 137.88 B: uh-huh 

138.40 150.08 A: someone did want to you know fly an airplane into a building or do something with an airplane again they they could still do it there's still ways around the airport security i mean you get a big you get a couple of big huge guys 

146.25 147.45 B: (( [noise] right [sigh] )) 

150.15 155.13 A: that board a plane no one's going to be able to stop them especially with no firearms on board 

153.86 155.90 B: right right 

155.94 158.72 B: and i hear that the uh security in in uh 

159.11 167.82 B: ya- european airports is is nothing like it is in the united states all you got to do is board the plane in another country and uh 

160.74 162.59 A: mhm 

165.74 167.30 A: oh jeeze 

167.86 174.37 B: [mn] chances are you can get what you need on board and [sigh] yeah so i i you know it's 

170.22 171.85 A: yeah 

174.22 184.08 B: [lipsmack] uh it's nice to see that the c- the country's reacting but i'm i'm a little concerned that we're focusing our energy in the wrong efforts i i like the intelligence gathering part of it 

183.59 184.88 A: yeah 

184.12 185.58 B: and i like uh 

185.86 197.50 B: even these warnings these security level warnings it kinda it kinda i think it's different but at the same time i think it kinda sends out the wrong signal if we're not sure something's going to happen you get in 

188.09 190.99 A: [noise] [mn] yeah that was a little a little different 

196.56 199.16 A: yeah you you don't raise the level [sigh] 

200.54 201.64 A: (( uh )) 

201.74 211.80 B: so [sigh] but uh yeah it's wild i would've never in my wildest dreams thought it would happen the other thing that's kinda disturbing is i guess 

211.82 220.83 B: they were close or they had some intelligence reports that there was going to be something big happening and they just couldn't [mn] couldn't act on it quick enough 

217.12 219.39 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah i've heard that too 

220.43 221.85 A: yeah there was just 

221.86 227.81 A: i heard that they had reports of you know s- something big was going to happen but they had no clue what it was 

228.39 232.47 A: so i just heard that they had really no chance of stopping anything 

232.74 233.65 B: wow 

233.97 239.71 B: [sigh] yeah and a lotta lotta people lost their lives lots of people lots their lives 

237.81 239.50 A: (( yeah )) 

241.44 244.77 B: do you d- you didn't happen to know anybody who was in the 

243.73 244.86 A: (( no )) 

245.83 247.53 B: (( yeah )) 

248.09 256.68 B: i mean i think uh next time i think uh you know it it'll be like a like a sporting event or a you know something where there's still a lo- a lot of people assembled together 

257.11 264.20 A: yeah it it's kinda like the movie [noise] um uh what's it called um it's a tom clancy movie 

265.03 279.56 A: i don't even remember what it's called now it's it's like his most recent book turned into a movie supposed to be before clear and present danger and all that stuff like before that ca- it's supposed to be a precursor to those movies him the guy working his way up to the c._i._a. 

269.19 270.27 B: mhm 

272.83 273.66 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

279.22 280.15 B: okay 

280.12 281.28 A: and um 

281.39 284.05 A: it just came out i think last year in the movie theaters 

284.32 289.60 A: and the main thing going on in the movie is a nuclear a nuclear bomb 

289.70 293.38 A: is going to explode in the superbowl 

294.10 305.54 A: and the whole plot like the the you don't even know what's going on until about like the towards the the middle end of the movie where they show them placing this giant bomb in a a vending machine 

304.90 306.32 B: (( [noise] wow )) 

305.59 312.51 A: and then the ve- then about a few minutes before it goes off they realize what's going on and they call the president who is at the game 

312.65 315.54 A: and they get him out and he just barely gets out 

315.55 317.09 B: was that at the movie theaters 

316.72 318.91 A: (( ye- no it came out last year )) 

318.33 319.78 B: at the movie theaters though 

319.09 325.84 A: yeah yeah it should be on um yeah yeah it's probably on d._v._d. now it was a pretty good movie 

319.97 320.88 B: huh 

322.03 323.17 B: d._v._d. 

325.52 326.95 B: tom clancy huh 

326.94 333.15 A: yeah i can i cannot remember for the life of me what it i mean it's a video game too it wasn't real good but 

327.32 328.91 B: (( i'll have to look that up [noise] )) 

332.57 337.97 B: okay i'll have to i'll have to remember that that's wild so um you think um 

333.17 334.20 A: [laughter] 

338.52 344.14 B: i mean did did like the kids in high school and stuff talk about this days and days afterwards or [noise] 

342.63 347.01 A: oh yeah well most of the like i i knew 

347.12 355.63 A: a friend of mine this girl and her boyfriend and i think one of their brothers or sisters was up there about two days before 

355.82 364.88 A: and they were like they were up there on a like a va- not a vacation but just like viewing the area they went up in the twin towers took pictures and stuff 

364.98 370.22 A: and then apparently they left their camera there and they were going to drive up that day to get it or something 

366.99 367.80 B: (( [sigh] mhm )) 

370.98 374.04 A: that was really like the biggest story going round school 

374.18 375.17 B: wow 

374.38 381.78 A: but you know like either they went up the day before to get the camera or they were planning on going up later that day 

382.08 387.35 A: but either way it was real a pretty strained moment for them 

386.67 390.21 B: yeah i can imagine had you ev- been to new york 

389.92 391.66 A: yeah no um i've 

391.77 393.76 A: i've been to a convention center 

393.40 394.25 B: okay 

393.89 397.68 A: like we drove through the streets but i didn't really spend time in the city [noise] yeah 

397.00 400.36 B: yeah i just you know i've never been there so 

400.42 410.63 B: to me i guess you know i i wish i had so that i could kinda have a lasting memory but i hear those towers were so tall and and so overpowering on the skyline 

405.54 407.12 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

411.06 419.08 B: um you know it it truly is an i- it was an icon of uh united states and so it you can see why it was a target 

417.86 419.47 A: mhm 

420.61 421.32 B: (( um )) 

421.48 432.35 B: [mn] uh i i you know the only thing i can think of from an impact perspective is maybe i'm more inclined to donate my time to help out others 

432.86 441.21 B: um you know i've you know i i do a lotta ha- you know community work habitat for humanity or working at food repositories 

441.36 442.36 B: um 

442.56 449.01 B: [lipsmack] but you know i'd like to think that i've always done that too bef- even before the the incident 

450.00 452.34 A: (( [noise] so maybe now you feel a little bit more )) 

452.53 458.15 A: li- like responsible like maybe it's your job to go out and do that more [noise] 

457.92 463.95 B: uh i don't know that i ever feel it's my job but i think i i feel better for doing it 

462.83 464.61 A: mhm 

463.97 465.03 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

466.13 473.87 B: [noise] do you think tha- it obviously it has i think it played a big role on uh on the decision bush had to go to war don't you 

473.09 474.94 A: yeah 

474.16 476.22 B: uh terrorism 

475.53 476.67 A: i remember 

477.06 480.84 A: it was i think the day after all that happened and he he 

481.00 486.35 A: went on he gave a big speech about it and um he said you know we're going to war 

486.43 492.25 A: to ki- to kill all communism or not communism terrorism i just did a paper on communism [laughter] 

489.77 490.61 B: right 

491.56 492.68 B: [laughter] 

492.26 497.78 A: and um he said we're not going to rest until any terrorist threat is going to be put down and 

496.98 499.84 B: and you're either with us or you're against us 

498.47 500.80 A: [mn] yeah and it's still going on now 

500.28 506.73 B: yeah and it's that's like quite a big battle i don't know that we're ever going to eradicate it [lipsmack] 

503.47 504.12 A: (( mm )) 

504.14 508.18 A: i i i don't think we yeah i don't think we had the full 

508.48 510.47 A: the full you know 

510.60 513.35 A: idea of what he really planned to do 

513.59 514.68 B: yeah 

513.93 515.28 A: with all this 

515.37 519.31 B: that's interesting 'cause now you see the newspaper articles with uh 

519.22 533.66 B: afghanistan crossed off and iraq crossed off but you still see syria and iran [laughter] and the and north korea yeah they're uh part of the axis of uh allah or what was that uh evil axis 

522.06 523.74 A: yeah 

524.76 525.78 A: [laughter] 

525.84 527.88 A: korea should be up there too 

529.94 531.22 A: yeah 

531.79 534.25 A: evil yeah 

534.50 535.79 B: yeah [sigh] 

536.22 551.21 B: yeah it's uh it you know it it is interesting though because t- something was done on our own home property you know it up until now you've always heard about these car bombings and things in israel and and you know other countries in you know africa [sigh] but uh 

542.11 543.54 A: mhm 

551.16 563.33 B: you never really ha- i guess you had that uh timothy mcveigh did the explosion in uh was that oklahoma city but um you you didn't have a lot of that in in the u._s. 

556.12 557.53 A: (( [lipsmack] [lipsmack] yeah )) 

558.16 560.40 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

563.36 566.51 B: so i guess it just it kinda proves that we're vulnerable 

566.59 574.23 A: and a big not a big impact but a a consequence is that now that any time hap- anything that happens of you know 

574.18 583.09 A: anything destructive happens we automatically either blame on terrorism or you know i- it's up there with a with the possibilities 

582.02 587.13 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] it's almost like you have to rule it out now whereas before yo- you know 

584.74 585.68 A: yeah 

586.23 588.08 A: it was yeah 

587.38 590.29 B: you didn't necessarily have to rule it out you had to rule it in 

589.77 591.45 A: mhm 

590.62 598.07 B: um yeah has it changed the way you look at uh foreigners when they're walking down the street or do you go to high school with any of them or 

597.75 599.37 A: (( mm not really )) 

598.78 599.79 B: no
