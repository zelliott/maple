0.22 1.63 B: (( hi how doing )) 

0.44 1.56 A: (( hi )) 

1.58 4.04 A: fine how are you mark spector here 

2.68 3.66 B: pretty good 

3.68 4.84 B: my name is mike 

4.82 5.82 A: hi mike 

6.02 10.07 B: [mn] so have you made any changes since nine eleven [noise] [noise] 

9.57 13.75 A: [noise] [noise] [sigh] have i made any tangible changes i really don't think so 

13.92 18.09 A: um if i had to point out the one thing that i think might be different 

18.52 25.99 A: it's that every thanksgiving we go to visit my parents in florida and after september eleventh we decided to drive but 

24.99 26.02 B: oh okay 

26.13 28.78 A: i don't know [noise] truth be told we might have done that anyway 

28.45 29.94 B: (( [noise] right )) 

28.81 33.65 A: i'm not really sure [noise] [laughter] so but that's pretty much it what about you i really [noise] [noise] i 

33.37 35.60 B: (( uh actually uh )) 

36.01 41.96 B: shortly after september eleventh we did we did fly my uh girlfriend and i we went on a trip to uh europe 

42.08 49.94 B: so the only thing that i think has changed with me is i think i'm more aware of my surroundings as to what's going on 

50.78 55.42 B: you know keeping my eye open for things that just seem out of the ordinary 

55.38 59.10 A: really i guess i would definitely agree with that i actually took a trip to uh [noise] where 

59.56 61.63 A: the heck did i go oh um 

61.88 66.38 A: [mn] what's this mm baltimore that's what it is baltimore maryland [noise] 

64.04 65.01 B: (( okay mhm )) 

66.85 71.22 A: after shortly after september eleventh actually like it was october or no 

71.40 72.82 A: november maybe 

72.49 73.72 B: right 

73.24 87.24 A: and um yeah i agree i think i was probably more aware of my surroundings keeping an eye on anyone who uh you know staring hard at them as i got on the plane [laughter] every single person just look at 'em uh don't try anything 

79.27 80.23 B: (( mhm right )) 

80.43 81.72 B: [noise] 

82.60 84.59 B: exactly right you know 

86.53 90.61 B: [laughter] exactly and keeping an eye out at the check points 

90.40 92.26 A: mhm 

90.82 94.62 B: 'cause we left it was the uh twentieth of september 

94.14 95.88 A: mhm 

94.93 102.27 B: 'cause we already pre- uh bought the tickets and everything and i just rationalized by that by what are the odds that something's going to happen that soon [laughter] 

97.95 99.70 A: (( [noise] )) 

102.62 110.72 B: and uh actually the security in europe was excellent so but like now sometimes i guess if i'm in a high rise 

110.57 119.06 B: i kind of get not really nervous but you know just maybe a little jittery it all depends especially now with the war going on and everything 

115.58 117.37 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

118.82 119.99 A: true enough 

120.75 121.64 A: so 

122.22 124.52 A: trying to think if there's anything else you know 

124.56 125.88 A: mm not really 

126.37 127.26 A: you know 

127.17 138.27 B: mhm i think more i think now i don't think there's as much as if as on that day 'cause i know like a couple of days afterwards i live right by the airport 

137.55 139.83 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

138.36 143.68 B: and you know every time you'd hear an airplane you'd get a little bit nervous and it's was like oh you know 

141.98 144.19 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

144.28 146.54 B: but so much time has passed 

146.24 152.18 A: right i remember the first time i saw an airplane in the sky after september eleventh i was like whoa we're flying again 

151.74 152.98 B: yep 

153.11 158.47 A: but um oh here's a crazy experience you'll probably find reasonably interesting i hope um 

158.96 165.25 A: [lipsmack] shortly after september eleventh a few months i was in a meeting at work and we were in an office 

165.41 179.04 A: um like a room that faced out towards the street and stuff you know not no- nothing nothing extremely high and nothing very fancy but you know had a big picture window you could see out of and um all of a sudden we're just you know talking at our meeting 

167.67 168.51 B: [noise] okay 

179.09 183.97 A: and we hear this airplane drone [noise] you know uh just incredibly close 

183.04 184.78 B: right [laughter] yeah 

184.14 197.25 A: somebody it turns out was screwing around with their private plane [noise] and they actually dove down to the point where they were probably no more than a hundred feet over the residences in the area 

189.75 190.63 B: oh 

196.46 198.18 B: (( you've gotta be kidding mhm oh my god )) 

197.67 203.31 A: it was insane i mean we were all looking out the window waiting to see the plane crash 

203.73 215.82 A: um when it pulled up and and banked away but that was uh [laughter] my manager she was like oh my god oh my god it was pretty intense though you know we all expected it to crash 

215.18 217.31 B: right jeeze i hope that guy 

216.29 217.30 A: (( so [noise] )) 

217.36 220.70 B: was reported or something 'cause that's pretty stupid to do especially ar- 

220.58 227.56 A: oh no we did we did and there was a whole investigation and [noise] you know people came from the airport to interview interview my boss and [noise] 

220.75 222.13 B: (( round that time [noise] yeah mm )) 

227.37 238.17 A: things like that and [noise] it was uh it was crazy but uh i don't know if the guy ever got nailed for screwing around but [noise] i think that's the official uh 

238.54 243.60 A: [noise] explanation of what actually wound up happening is you know he was just being an idiot 

243.86 246.60 B: yeah well you know some people are like that 

244.09 245.03 A: so 

245.96 248.66 A: gotta wonder what goes through people's heads so 

247.41 249.05 B: (( [noise] yeah [lipsmack] )) 

249.46 250.49 A: was that you 

249.67 254.85 B: so yep that's my phone i think it's dying on me great [laughter] it's a cordless 

251.67 255.85 A: [noise] [noise] oh [laughter] oh you're going to mess up the study 

255.12 256.04 B: (( uh-huh )) 

256.20 260.51 B: oh that's okay we've just got five minutes left i think it'll be okay it'll probably beep a couple more times 

259.98 261.52 A: okay so [sigh] 

261.82 265.12 A: how many uh how many of these conversations have you had 

264.42 266.18 B: uh this will be my third one 

265.95 267.34 A: oh okay mine too 

267.04 268.42 B: yeah 

267.88 273.48 A: so and you get we get paid paid like ten bucks per shot right have you seen any of the money yet 

269.45 270.01 B: (( [cough] )) 

271.05 272.12 B: right 

272.90 278.70 B: um no i just started last week and actually i talked to somebody today 'cause they give you an eight hundred number 

278.42 279.41 A: uh-huh 

278.91 284.11 B: and i guess what they do is at the end of the month they tally everything and then they'll send you out the check 

283.82 287.19 A: oh okay 'cause i was going to say i wonder if that's that's how they do it 

286.59 293.46 B: yeah so i think it's like uh but he said it was four to five weeks after your call or 

287.23 288.10 A: so 

292.82 297.36 A: okay well that's no big deal i can wait i'm not so hard up i need thirty bucks right away 

293.78 295.18 B: (( it's yeah )) 

296.63 297.90 B: (( [cough] right [noise] )) 

297.95 299.72 A: we'll survive a week or two 

299.97 301.51 A: or five whatever 

300.62 302.16 B: (( yeah it's not too bad [noise] )) 

301.84 303.58 A: so [sigh] 

303.67 318.24 A: but i feel guilty they give us these topics and i don't think like yesterday or or day before whatever i talked to a guy and i couldn't talk about that topic for it was about censorship i'm just like gosh it was so impossible to have a conversation with him [laughter] 

313.13 314.19 B: mhm 

317.81 323.43 B: right well it i think it it hurts because the topics that they're giving us everybody can agree on 

323.63 325.83 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

324.15 334.99 B: you know so if it was something that was a little bit more controversial like if i said you know if i didn't care about nine e- eleven and that then you'd have a good conversation [laughter] 

334.79 336.17 A: right 

335.41 339.79 B: but after like the first couple of minutes then everything's pretty much talked out 

338.79 342.67 A: mhm [lipsmack] so whereabouts are you 

342.27 343.57 B: i'm in chicago 

343.53 350.02 A: oh i talked to somebody else in chicago i went to school in chicago depaul university 

346.45 347.86 B: oh yeah where'd you go to 

348.66 350.30 B: (( okay yeah i know where that's at i )) 

350.97 352.41 A: [noise] i'm sorry say it again 

351.98 353.87 B: said yeah i know where that's at 

353.41 359.36 A: yeah so i lived in lincoln park for like four years what part of chicago are you in 

356.83 357.64 B: wow 

358.97 364.54 B: i'm near o'hare in rosemont yeah so that's why i said i'm right by the airport 

360.48 361.78 A: [noise] oh okay 

364.35 366.64 A: i fly out of o'hare very often 

367.02 369.88 A: just because sometimes it pays i'm in grand rapids michigan a 

369.99 373.50 A: lot of times it just makes even though it's a three hour drive 

373.65 380.74 A: saves me a ton of cash to fly out of o'hare rather than fly out of grand rapids sometimes it'll add two hundred dollars to a flight 

375.56 377.21 B: mm uh-huh right and you don't 

380.29 381.64 B: oh jeeze 

381.75 382.83 A: so 

381.86 388.12 B: and plus you have you have uh better choices from o'hare too you don't have to make as many connections i'm sure i 

387.43 389.18 A: [noise] [noise] i'm sorry say that again 

388.86 392.47 B: said you don't have to make as many connections i'm sure if you leave out of o'hare 

391.05 399.07 A: oh absolutely yeah if there's anything i hate about flying it's going up and down a hundred times so we flew to florida recently my 

395.54 396.97 B: yeah 

397.03 398.95 B: getting out and running to the next 

399.61 405.97 A: buddy and i and we were able to go straight through so that was a no brainer i definitely flew drove to chicago for that one 

399.63 400.39 B: (( plane [cough] )) 

400.62 401.18 B: (( [cough] )) 

402.24 403.27 B: mhm 

404.30 404.88 B: (( [cough] )) 

405.49 406.96 B: oh yeah 

406.98 408.58 B: (( that's always the best )) 

408.24 409.68 A: (( [mn] )) 

409.58 412.28 B: (( um trying to [noise] think of anything else for nine eleven yeah )) 

412.27 413.20 A: (( [mn] no )) 

413.61 420.36 A: so we have some pretty heavy handed security here in grand rapids why i have no idea but hey better safe than sorry 

419.32 428.60 B: that's right well i know that uh the mayor of chicago was upset uh when the war broke out because they didn't uh dedicate chicago as a no fly zone 

428.76 432.66 B: but he had the data for right the data for new york and for um 

428.97 430.60 A: oh really 

432.72 437.39 B: los angeles and he was like well hello [laughter] chicago 

433.76 434.75 A: huh 

436.32 438.01 A: right 

438.04 441.86 A: center of the uh [noise] midwest 

440.46 441.46 B: (( right you )) 

441.81 443.83 B: (( know it's the second largest city )) 

442.53 447.11 A: sometimes i think chicago should be its own state and the rest of illinois should 

446.50 449.14 B: yeah well that's how the mayor runs it so [laughter] 

448.02 449.60 A: [laughter] 

449.71 452.64 B: no but actually he's doing a good job so i can't really complain 

452.63 454.54 A: [noise] right so 

455.28 458.71 B: [mn] actually i think this city's doing better than the state [laughter] 

458.26 459.72 A: mhm 

460.43 462.16 A: oh goodness gracious 

462.29 463.70 A: (( so [lipsmack] ))

473.41 476.21 A: i've never even recognized the opportunity to 

476.01 486.94 B: [noise] uh right after they say okay you're all say your goodbyes then a recording comes on and it tells you push push a bu- press a button i think it's one to leave any comments 

486.75 491.28 A: [lipsmack] oh i didn't even realize i've always just hung it up [noise] 

490.24 491.80 B: yeah see [laughter]

498.33 499.46 A: (( oh okay ))

502.15 503.16 B: (( now [laughter] )) 

505.19 514.42 B: [noise] uh yeah it just gives you like a certain like thirty seconds i think to make your comments or it tells you when you're done just push the pound [noise] just push the pound key or something

529.97 535.86 A: mhm mhm that's probably what they're they're most interested in anyway 

532.01 533.42 B: know how frustrating
