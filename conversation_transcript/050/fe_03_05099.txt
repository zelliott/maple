0.18 2.84 B: uh hi my name is angela 

3.32 5.39 A: hi my name is michael 

4.94 9.87 B: yeah hi michael um what's your opinion on it i i really haven't been 

10.10 18.27 B: uh to airports personally that much especially since nine one one i just i just have qualms about it 

18.30 21.48 A: [noise] first of all angela where are you what state 

20.56 22.94 B: i i'm in las vegas nevada 

23.27 26.39 A: and how often do you fly on a normal basis 

26.94 38.03 B: not at all not especially not since nine one one i i just i haven't we most of the times we wanna go places we just uh we drive and we we haven't even done that a lot lately 

37.75 40.01 A: wow when's the last time you flew 

40.51 46.70 B: the last time i flew i think was probably a year prior to to nine one one 

46.33 48.67 A: okay fair deal not a lot 

48.12 50.21 B: now do you do a lot of air travel 

50.52 55.14 A: not recently no i have in the past um 

53.50 54.56 B: mhm 

55.24 64.16 A: but it it has not been lapsed due to what's gone on it's actually just been due to job change and 

63.45 64.36 B: (( mhm )) 

64.34 67.98 A: you know different directions but uh 

68.27 73.85 A: i'd say i'm probably one of those you know many that just don't let that really stand in my way 

73.48 74.47 B: sure 

75.02 82.70 B: i mean if there's places you've got to and you've you've flying is the only way to get there i mean i naturally it's something that you you you have to do 

75.07 77.04 A: airport security is definitely 

82.79 84.07 A: right 

84.08 91.09 A: yeah sometimes you know i guess a lot of people do have to fly back and forth sometimes for business or what have you but um 

91.61 95.08 A: i think i think it's a good thing that they stepped up security 

94.67 95.83 B: yes 

95.21 96.18 A: (( because um )) 

96.30 99.42 A: i think that they probably still need to step up more 

99.82 103.85 A: but i guess it's been effective in a lot of ways because 

104.06 115.96 A: obviously with all the dissension that's been going on in the middle east and everything else it would seem that a lot of the threats coming from al qaeda and a lot of other terrorist groups 

115.57 116.48 B: mhm 

116.78 120.04 A: they haven't really carried through thankfully 

120.49 122.31 B: well hopefully they won't [laughter] 

121.88 123.80 A: right exactly and and it's 

123.86 130.12 A: it it's just nice to know that you know stepping up security it it's just kinda of level one kind of thing where 

130.21 136.83 A: you know they're gonna look for certain actions from people certain looks their certain profiles 

137.10 143.75 A: and uh they just try to do the best they can but looking through baggage and everything else you know is 

144.02 148.10 A: i think we'd like to convince ourselves that we live in a world right now where 

148.63 151.29 A: you know everybody's just out to do a 

151.54 157.82 A: you know a little travelling and enjoy themselves and everything else but the unfortunate thing is is 

159.21 160.79 A: [mn] when you have people 

161.01 172.42 A: excuse me i've got some peanut butter stuck [laughter] in my throat [cough] but when you have people that are out to you know do you harm and they threaten you openly and say you know we will 

162.96 164.19 B: that's okay 

172.49 177.77 A: literally we're raging war against the american people and will try to hit you anywhere we can 

178.07 187.65 A: uh i think that's where terrorism begins is they wanna scare you into believing that you know oh don't go flying and don't do this and don't do that because 

188.21 190.19 A: you know we could blow up any plane 

190.67 196.41 A: and um i think a part of terrorism is just being able to hold that over our heads 

196.71 207.34 B: well i agree with you there but i i know i have family members and uh you know friends that i know they just don't like the inconvenience of having to go through you know 

196.83 197.78 A: and 

203.05 203.89 A: right 

207.34 217.74 B: the security checks and things like that but i thought hey better to be inconvenienced for a few minutes and uh you know take a longer time and it's it's just that you know in american we're just 

212.97 213.83 A: right 

218.15 224.52 B: having to go through this now but in other countries they've been going through it you know for some time i have a friend that uh 

223.77 224.46 A: right 

224.47 228.47 B: well well when she was with her ex husband in uh in the military 

228.41 240.30 B: she used to frequently have to fly from germany back here and she said well she said i'm used that she said you had to get to the the airport hours in germany before you can fly any place because their security is so tight 

240.14 242.19 A: they have it down to a science though 

240.21 250.88 B: but now we're we're having to get used to that here and i guess because we have the mentality in america you know instant everything it's just [mn] it's an adjustment thing 

250.64 263.58 A: yeah it is it is well it's a reality check too because we've actually been one of the few countries that have have really been free of that you know we haven't really had any terrorist action on our soil 

264.85 270.74 A: nine eleven was our major event so to speak and it's and it changed everything it really did 

270.35 273.02 B: uh just a big huge wake up call 

272.43 287.05 A: yeah it really was and and it's just you know so now it is go- good you know it's good that we're stepping up and and i think the hardest thing right now a- as far as the security goes is i think we still need to get it down to more of a science where 

287.34 288.42 A: you know 

288.64 295.54 A: i i think it's good that we have a- an orange alert and a yellow alert and a red alert and everything else but 

293.85 294.75 B: mhm 

295.56 296.60 A: um 

297.16 301.94 A: i think it's really good i i think the objective of the airport security right now 

302.10 308.65 A: is is kinda get to to get the word out saying we are going to be doing random searches 

308.80 313.87 A: we are going to be delaying you we are going to be looking in your bags 

314.09 319.14 A: and what it's doing is it it's kinda doing a reverse terrorism 

318.70 319.59 B: (( yeah )) 

318.92 329.60 A: it it's it's kinda making the american people number one realize like okay so it's not travel's not going to be as convenient or easy as it's been in the past 

327.78 328.71 B: mhm 

328.79 329.57 B: (( true )) 

329.73 335.61 A: but at the same time it's understood that you know it's gonna give you more of a feeling of safety 

336.11 340.76 B: well i'm you know my hopes are also too that they they're they are are 

340.88 342.67 B: making sure that the people that are 

342.61 355.13 B: doing the security checks are competent uh not in las vegas but in another area of of of nevada uh well it's been about a year since it happened they had to fire somebody that was uh 

355.02 365.79 B: doing security checks because they fell asleep [laughter] while they were i think we want somebody wi- with you know a little bit more uh responsibility than that 

359.24 360.36 A: yeah 

365.73 370.89 A: right right yeah you definitely wanna well yeah that's 

370.69 384.23 A: kind of uh [laughter] it does not instill confidence uh i would have to agree with that but at the same time again you know they're trying to step it up and um they're trying to hire the right people and they 

375.11 376.51 B: (( [laughter] no it doesn't )) 

384.35 387.31 A: they've looked at privatizing the industry 

387.33 401.18 A: uh and i think in some areas they still are privatizing the industry it was government sanctioned and then it's government paid but yet private privately sanctioned so to speak where they're taking in private companies 

400.72 401.76 B: mhm 

401.43 408.49 A: and um and i think it you know i think any time you bring anything into the private sector so to speak 

407.26 408.06 B: (( yeah )) 

408.56 412.14 A: i i think you you where you leave it open to competition 

411.74 413.05 B: yeah 

412.40 421.16 A: you're gonna get a better group of people because yeah you you're gonna have that that element of you know well you know we gotta do better than the next 

414.13 416.37 B: i agree i agree with you there 

421.27 427.55 A: um but i still think that the bottom line is that you know we still have to have that guarantee of security 

427.80 435.74 A: where we feel that okay so we're gonna we're gonna be delayed an hour or two hours when we go to the airport but you know when you get on that plane 

435.90 438.04 A: and you're sitting there you i i think 

438.19 442.75 A: for the most part it's gonna be more of a positive thing you're gonna be feeling a little bit better 

442.38 443.74 B: yeah 

443.09 451.89 A: and and uh you know at least knowing that those precautions have been taken whereas if you just go to the airport and they have you sitting on your plane within ten minutes of arrival 

452.06 461.20 A: especially with what's going on you know you you're gonna be sitting there thinking like do i really wanna be on this plane and and i think another big responsibility 

461.57 470.00 A: you know bush is trying to pick up the economy and everything else and instill the faith in the american people that ya you can start spending money and believing in 

466.64 467.40 B: yeah 

470.07 483.61 A: uh you know everything you know re- basically get the economy going again and and uh you know fair trade the whole nine yards and travelling to other countries is the big things 

483.69 487.45 A: because so many countries it seems have been 

488.59 492.21 A: not i g- i guess not sitting in our corner 

492.46 504.52 B: yeah and and they've been wary about coming you know here i thought sometimes we we think of it in terms of us being afraid to get on a plane and go to where they are but but a lot of them are worried about coming here because 

493.08 493.90 A: you know 

496.35 497.18 A: right 

501.30 502.05 A: right 

504.41 518.11 B: i you know now that the terrorism has come here they're i mean they're they're actually afraid to come here because they think that you know something's gonna happen to them by virtue of them visiting us and the you know the terrorists threats that have uh been against america 

517.77 527.67 A: right and now it it's also the opposite where you know they're telling us that we need to stay out of all these other countries because the threat against american people 

528.06 534.56 A: is very real so there's a lot of countries that you know the american people are being advised to stay away from 

535.06 543.54 A: and uh you know that's certainly adding to the dilemma too and and all these things are combining to just constrain our 

543.86 546.90 A: the american dollar and our economy that much more 

546.84 553.95 B: well in terms of the air security what what's your opinion about them allowing uh some of the pilots to have guns 

553.20 555.41 A: i think it should definitely be 

555.31 556.49 B: mhm 

555.89 557.50 A: no doubt about it 

557.72 571.00 A: and and the security precautions that they're taking on the doors and everything else but yeah i think the american pilots i mean they've already got a huge responsibility about you know being responsible for the hundreds of people that on their airplane 

571.68 583.66 A: and uh most of the pilots from what i understand have already been militarily trained anyway i think most of the pilots were once upon a time ago you know they were military pilots 

583.08 585.71 B: yeah a lot of them are retired air force 

584.37 592.26 A: right and so they've already gone through a certain degree of gun handling and gun responsibility and everything else 

592.46 597.35 A: and at the same time you know if they're going to be solely responsible in the cockpit 

597.45 599.95 A: for all the lives that are lying within
