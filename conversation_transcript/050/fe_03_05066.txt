49.03 52.96 B: haven't heard too much uh is is one of them going on strike 

52.43 60.19 A: mm i don't know that's why i i don't think so i haven't i know there's baseball but that was last season so 

54.83 55.70 B: 'cause i 

55.90 58.79 B: i haven't heard anything on the news today 

59.37 61.08 B: yeah yeah 

61.16 62.60 B: uh 

63.01 73.28 B: i think they're paid way too much [laughter] and then you know for them to go out on strike because they don't think they're getting their fair share or whatever 

65.12 67.07 A: (( yeah they are paid a lot )) 

68.87 69.76 A: yeah 

70.68 71.24 A: (( [noise] )) 

72.91 73.92 A: yeah 

73.33 75.51 B: is a little ridiculous 

75.30 80.24 A: i'm a little biased with them because um i play baseball myself so 

79.97 80.99 B: uh-huh 

80.86 84.51 A: i want to be at that level i'm at college right now but 

83.84 86.10 B: uh that's cool 

84.90 92.62 A: uh yeah so i i don't think but when i hear about them going on strike i think that's ridiculous 

92.44 93.55 B: (( yes )) 

92.94 104.26 A: i mean in baseball i don't know about other sports the league minimum is three hundred thousand dollars i mean before that when you're in minor league it's really bad you 

104.30 111.95 A: you don't get any money basically but if you make it to the majors the league minimum is three hundred thousand dollars which is 

106.18 107.36 B: right 

112.16 114.22 A: a good amount of money 

113.62 117.87 B: yeah that's not too shabby for what is it about nine months 

115.54 117.17 A: huh not bad at all 

117.18 118.92 A: yeah exactly 

118.33 120.23 B: (( yeah )) 

119.31 123.50 A: what i think is amazing is um how much the umpires get paid 

123.78 133.27 A: i mean i don't know their exact salary but uh i hear that they're making over a hundred thousand dollars plus they get a vacation within 

133.39 136.83 A: [mn] within the season and then obviously after 

137.57 143.46 A: with all the perks and everything it's it's media that's why they make all their money it's all media ware 

137.58 138.58 B: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

142.33 145.02 B: right right 

145.69 152.16 B: and as long as the fans are willing to pay for it they're going to get it [laughter] 

148.65 150.11 A: that's right 

150.50 154.05 A: that's right that's true mhm 

153.22 155.27 B: now i i remember 

155.36 164.07 B: uh what was it eighty eighty something when baseball went out on strike and it took a long time for them to 

164.04 167.43 A: get the fans back out there yeah they 

165.20 166.34 B: yeah 

166.80 172.09 B: in in fact there there's still a lot of times when they they show the 

172.48 176.31 B: the bleachers and all that where there's a lot of seats they're still empty 

175.81 180.39 A: oh well i was just watching a game right now tampa bay playing um 

180.41 183.34 A: the angels and nobody was there 

183.13 184.28 B: [laughter] 

183.97 192.36 A: nobody i mean it's ridiculous they got lou cannell in there now trying to get 'em in but i mean nobody was showing out there 

191.72 192.69 B: (( yeah uh )) 

192.55 194.21 A: (( it's ridiculous [cough] mm )) 

196.71 203.05 B: i i have to admit the last game that i went to was i believe in 

203.49 209.27 B: ninety nine and it i was in um arlington texas 

209.48 215.55 B: and the rangers just happened to be home while i was there so i thought ah i'll get time to take it in a game 

215.70 220.00 B: and uh yeah i i enjoyed it 

219.46 220.67 A: yeah 

221.07 222.04 B: so 

221.64 225.14 A: (( it's always fun to be out there but yeah i mean )) 

225.72 232.25 A: i guess the topic is if they get paid that much do you think they should go on strike or not i think that's ridiculous and uh 

231.42 232.70 B: yeah 

232.32 234.47 A: it's especially when 

234.62 235.50 A: i mean 

235.78 241.06 A: [sigh] what i really hate are the guys that you know just play the game because they're good at it you know what i mean 

240.75 241.67 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

241.65 253.39 A: huh there's some out there and and they're just so damn good at the game that they can just go out there they'd rather be doing something else but i mean it pays them so well and all the people are working so hard but 

250.39 252.06 B: yeah 

253.35 259.54 B: yeah yeah i i i don't care what sport it was 

259.82 260.83 B: if if 

260.89 266.22 B: if they were going out on strike i i think i would boycott them again 

265.92 267.16 A: yeah 

267.06 270.87 B: you know uh i i lean more towards football 

270.53 273.34 A: mhm okay well i watch i play that too 

270.97 272.32 B: but uh 

273.33 274.26 B: (( uh-huh )) 

274.64 277.05 B: [noise] and uh 

278.79 280.67 B: like you say if if they're gonna 

280.86 285.17 B: say uh well we don't like the working conditions or whatever um 

285.39 291.16 B: improve the working conditions but if they're going on strike because of their salaries i don't think so 

290.64 292.37 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

292.17 294.91 B: i i i wouldn't go see them any more 

294.37 298.80 A: no exactly i agree with you completely you don't complain about those [laughter] 

295.08 296.98 B: for a while 

299.41 301.14 B: yeah 

301.56 302.52 B: so 

302.71 311.49 B: anyway uh how long are we supposed to talk ten minutes [laughter] uh so far all we've talked is about four minutes 

306.18 308.18 A: ten minutes i think it is 

308.50 309.51 A: (( i know )) 

310.86 312.92 A: yeah i think so [laughter] 

312.12 313.64 B: [laughter]

320.50 321.83 A: yeah 

321.93 325.37 B: well you got a lot more opportunity to go see professional 

324.55 327.40 A: oh definitely i go to the dodgers 

327.91 330.74 A: angels are pretty close by so 

330.45 331.45 B: (( sport uh-huh )) 

331.29 335.42 A: and then i i went to go see uh san diego last summer that was fun 

335.65 337.09 A: (( a nice field )) 

336.69 337.56 B: (( yes )) 

338.91 348.79 B: well i guess uh the closest for me to go would be either san francisco oakland or up to um 

345.65 347.33 A: (( mm yeah )) 

349.55 351.16 B: seattle 

351.00 352.52 A: (( mm uh i think it's called ))

358.39 360.09 A: (( like that safeco yeah yeah )) 

358.81 360.60 B: especially since uh 

361.00 362.50 B: the mariners were 

363.36 365.28 B: on a little bit of a run aren't they 

364.72 367.19 A: yeah yes yeah they're doing pretty well 

366.83 368.28 B: (( [laughter] )) 

367.72 370.89 A: (( and san francisco that's been doing really well actually lately )) 

370.25 372.06 B: yeah 

371.75 375.41 A: unfortunately [laughter] they're a dodger rival so it's okay 

373.19 374.85 B: (( yeah )) 

375.57 379.84 B: i i when i was a a kid i was a big dodger fan 

379.47 380.59 A: (( were you )) 

380.17 384.55 B: that's when i was in little league i i played on the dodgers you know 

383.92 387.89 A: [laughter] always fun 

386.68 389.32 B: [laughter] i always wanted to go see 

389.50 394.20 B: sandy koufax pitch that's how long ago [laughter] 

391.12 392.12 A: (( yeah )) 

393.46 394.97 A: (( sandy ko- koufax )) 

395.00 396.37 A: a wonderful pitcher 

395.78 402.03 B: i yeah down in drysdale yeah so 

398.84 400.61 A: (( yeah )) 

400.96 401.98 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

402.62 406.08 B: [sigh] you sure didn't see them guys complaining about their salaries 

404.95 410.43 A: [laughter] no exactly and uh they were making a lot less than they are now 

410.08 411.90 B: yeah 

411.18 411.96 A: (( mm )) 

411.95 416.73 B: i i think back then it was more for the love of the game than it was for the money 

414.43 418.22 A: exactly and that's how it should be it should be that way 

417.96 419.75 B: yeah 

420.34 421.49 A: (( definitely )) 

421.60 423.30 B: yeah 

424.13 424.98 B: (( [sigh] uh-huh )) 

424.57 428.73 A: [laughter] going on strike because they yeah that's ridiculous and 

428.39 430.09 B: yeah 

429.33 439.20 A: go with with the union or something like that i mean this is one problem that i have though because um the managers and all that try to get everybody 

439.38 452.17 A: for example one of the guys that was on the angels i i read an article about it i didn't go too deep into it but basically it was saying one of the guys on the roster that finished out and played for 'em at the end i forget who it was 

442.17 443.16 B: (( mhm )) 

452.91 458.86 A: wasn't able to they didn't have his name 'cause i guess they put out all these shirts you know 

458.70 467.22 A: the you know the world champions and everyone's name and everything and they wouldn't put his name because he wasn't with the union or something ridiculous 

460.75 462.12 B: oh uh-huh 

466.53 468.57 B: uh that's baloney 

467.17 474.92 A: thing like that i mean how horrible is that i mean like you said if it's working conditions or that type of deal then 

475.19 479.12 A: maybe but for salary or with wages no never 

479.50 481.36 B: yeah 

481.66 483.51 B: (( yeah )) 

484.51 485.21 A: [laughter] 

485.03 488.32 B: probably six minutes have gone by now [laughter] 

486.52 489.48 A: [laughter] wonderful [sigh] 

488.84 490.61 B: [laughter] 

491.08 494.03 B: [sigh] uh lets see 

497.64 504.09 B: yeah i don't really know all the ins and outs of n._b._l. i how the a baseball team gets their 

504.45 508.03 B: other than through the ticket sales and so much of the 

508.16 513.81 B: received through [sigh] concessions at the ballpark and all that 

512.71 514.08 A: yeah 

513.98 520.98 B: but uh i i i know the last time i went it to get a beer and popcorn was pretty expensive 

520.29 523.69 A: [noise] oh definitely it is it is very expensive there 

523.91 526.38 A: yeah that's one of the problems 

525.84 527.28 B: yeah 

526.98 531.45 A: [laughter] they jack up the prices to make sure they can keep their salaries paid for 

530.74 532.39 B: (( [noise] [laughter] well )) 

533.03 535.60 B: it's all them high price dudes 

534.91 536.72 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

536.51 540.34 B: so i think one of the ways that they could probably get around doing that is 

540.36 546.96 B: instead of paying them these high prices all in the old lump sum type thing is if they hit a home run 

544.67 545.49 A: (( mm )) 

548.33 551.19 B: give them a ten thousand dollar check 

550.60 554.98 A: (( [laughter] yeah okay yeah )) 

551.37 553.44 B: you know something along those lines 

554.01 560.59 B: instead of getting up there and striking out three times and still getting to have a ten thousand dollar check 

556.69 559.58 A: i hear you yeah an incentive 

560.13 563.09 A: yeah yeah exactly 

562.35 565.53 B: i guess that's pay for players or something like that 

565.03 566.39 A: [laughter] 

565.69 568.10 B: or if they make a play they get a pay 

567.81 572.40 A: yeah they always have a some- you know sometimes they sign in the contract you know 

572.38 583.62 A: incentives like that like if you win this many games as a pitcher you get this much bonus stuff like that which is good and maybe keep keep the um 

578.93 580.74 B: yeah yeah 

583.97 589.33 A: price of the contract down and then pay off of that yeah 

586.89 588.78 B: mhm 

588.81 589.97 B: yeah 

591.58 594.47 A: a lot of the guys i mean they've gone through such hell 

594.55 599.89 A: i have a couple of friends right now they're in the minor leagues and just they [laughter]
