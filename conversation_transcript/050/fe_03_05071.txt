40.11 47.37 A: [laughter] yeah yeah hey well listen uh what do we have here strikes by uh professional players 

45.74 52.13 B: professional athletes and should they be paid as much as they are [noise] 

49.63 52.98 A: the high salaries the high salaries that they are 

52.59 54.07 B: yeah 

53.35 59.28 A: oh yeah i i wouldn't mind being a professional uh player i'm a ball player myself as a matter of fact 

58.02 60.49 B: [noise] [noise] uh that's i think it'd be [noise] 

59.54 60.55 A: but uh 

61.98 63.35 A: yeah 

62.76 65.77 B: sorry my microphone keeps going out [laughter] 

65.14 66.31 A: oh okay 

66.26 73.35 B: it's uh yeah it'd be kind of nice to just sit around all day and play and make you know like a million dollars a year for it [noise] [noise] 

72.76 86.72 A: yeah i was just talking with a friend the other day and we were talking about golf and i says man what a living that is [noise] you know that's got uh you know i mean i how would how difficult could that be [noise] you know i'm sure you know with the golfing experience that i've had [noise] 

86.69 89.86 A: you know i'm not the greatest golfer in the world but still 

89.88 102.39 A: you know that that's got to be the the the easiest job in the world if [noise] if i could go back thirty years i probably would've uh practiced a little harder at uh at golf and uh maybe i'd done something with it [noise] 

102.62 103.99 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] okay )) 

102.78 108.52 A: but i you know when you compare it to football players base- baseball players uh 

108.70 114.94 A: basketball players you know i think those guys uh take a good take a pretty good beating especially the football players 

115.20 116.54 A: so uh 

115.60 116.38 B: yeah 

116.51 130.06 B: yeah the football players might need those high salaries just to pay their medical bills and to be uh to pay for the fact that after they uh after they retire they're going to be um pretty much you know a lot of them have messed up bodies and problems and stuff like that they 

129.41 137.48 A: [noise] yeah they're uh they're just just about useless you know whenever they reach what thirty thirty five years old [noise] and 

130.30 131.36 B: (( gotta deal with )) 

132.90 133.71 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

135.28 137.80 B: yeah your body's destroyed [noise] [noise] 

137.50 144.79 A: you know so in in in in one respect i i i feel that you know some of these guys deserve the salaries that they're getting 

144.67 159.03 A: uh because you know this is going to be their job and this is l- like something instead of you or me working until we're sixty five these guys have got you know to let make their money uh spread out o- o- o- over you know god knows how long 

158.60 159.84 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

159.09 163.18 A: [noise] if ever they're not signing uh a ton of endorsements uh 

163.19 168.08 A: you know of sorts [noise] but i i'm not a real big sports person are are you 

168.03 178.57 B: [noise] [noise] uh not particularly i actually don't follow any sports [laughter] ah i'll watch an occasional like foot- uh football game on t._v. at work but i don't even usually watch t._v. that much so 

171.12 172.34 A: oh okay 

174.69 176.30 A: yeah 

178.09 179.47 A: oh okay 

178.61 187.63 B: i'm not uh i'm not i'm not a big follower every once in a while like [noise] there was a recent article in some newspaper or magazine about like how much every you know everyone makes 

187.62 188.65 A: (( [cough] right )) 

187.65 195.45 B: and it it listed all the s- you know a bunch of sports players and actors and actresses and how much they made and it was just like ridiculous [noise] mhm 

191.90 192.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

194.86 205.63 A: yeah yeah [noise] well the ball players are as far as baseball players are yeah i i'm kind of skeptical about that a little bit you know i mean because 

206.06 213.02 A: you know first of all it's like uh if you know i'm sure their knees probably go out uh a little earlier than normal people 

213.07 220.44 A: [noise] but uh you know i think some of these guys are getting you know some pretty outrageous salaries plus 

220.43 229.10 A: you know they're bringing a lot of these guys in and they have been bringing these guys in from what um um cuba or uh uh uh puerto rico 

228.68 229.75 B: yeah 

229.20 234.90 A: uh there's different different uh places and just paying them you know uh salaries out the wazoo [noise] 

235.07 244.65 A: and uh do you know in in a way i- i'm kind of like uh skeptical about that because you know their government basically supports them 

244.60 250.84 A: you know whenever they're growing up and they find you know somebody that has good potential their government supports them 

250.83 263.40 A: takes care of them makes sure that they get the best of everything and then they come over here and you know united states and they get these outrageous salaries and then they're basically taking out you know money back uh you know to cuba or whatever 

263.13 264.48 B: yeah 

263.76 270.65 A: you know so you know i i i'm kind of skeptical about that because you know i feel that there's enough uh 

270.60 282.26 A: you know there's enough american ball players here you know right here in the united states that uh are as good if not better but maybe they're just not being given the same chance 

282.27 287.75 A: you know that these other guys who have been uh groomed you know throughout the throughout the years 

282.72 283.47 B: yeah 

287.44 301.29 B: [noise] yeah i don't know [noise] my worst problem is when i see the ones that are just making millions of dollars just for entertaining people it's like you they're not really doing anything particularly positive to make the world better [laughter] and they're making tons more money than 

288.45 289.69 A: but 

297.92 298.84 A: yeah 

301.47 308.52 B: all these people who are working to make the world better and what do they do with their money they just [noise] take it and use spend it on themselves 

305.73 308.09 A: yeah yeah yeah i i got a 

308.24 310.27 A: yeah i can see your point there 

310.28 317.75 A: [noise] uh but what does it what what about the strikes what are the what are the strikes normally about because of uh money right 

316.69 319.88 B: yeah more money they want more money [noise] [noise] [noise] 

317.77 318.42 A: (( no )) 

318.39 331.83 A: yeah [noise] see i know uh it's been disturbing in the past uh you know i mean the uh threaten the season you know i mean especially like like baseball where you have a lot of kids attending [noise] 

321.27 322.16 B: [noise] 

331.59 337.62 A: you know uh see i i don't agree with that so it's you know i think uh i think that should be done like 

334.24 335.59 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

337.82 351.30 A: like like any corporation you know but not not affect the whole season and postpone the season i think i remember one yeah one year it was like the a a i don't even know if they got to play the world series uh 

338.99 340.79 B: [noise] yeah 

344.01 344.92 B: yeah 

351.42 355.95 A: uh a few years back because of the the strike interfered with everything 

351.48 352.61 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

354.85 356.53 B: [noise] [noise] yeah i'm not 

356.52 370.80 B: i don't think they should be complaining about how much money they make i think if if they have the right to complain and strike for more money if they don't produce what the ball club wants them to produce like winning games the ball club should be able to like lower their salaries 

366.25 367.17 A: uh-huh 

370.76 379.06 B: if they want more money for just playing then you know it should be like oh if you you know p- pl- pay per how good you play 

378.91 379.96 A: uh-huh 

379.42 382.16 B: instead of how good they that you expect 

381.89 383.20 A: (( yeah al- )) 

382.24 384.23 B: yourself to be playing or something 

383.66 391.52 A: oh that would be a novel concept you think it you think somebody would have thought of that by now right you know what i mean 

385.77 387.47 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

391.16 392.42 B: yeah yeah it 

391.59 396.44 A: you know it's like yeah yeah it does that that's that's pretty interesting there 

395.88 400.88 B: but i think the the most losing ball cl- ball club is the one that makes the least amount of money [noise] 

396.58 397.95 A: yeah you'd 

400.69 410.73 A: right right yeah i've been out you know out here in california where they had the uh the anaheim angels you know and then they had the ducks uh for hockey 

407.42 408.35 B: mhm 

410.96 418.77 A: and uh you know people are pretty uh pretty you know excited about that uh but you know the angels aren't doing so good right now 

417.12 418.23 B: [noise] 

419.09 420.59 A: and uh 

419.61 420.27 B: (( [noise] )) 

420.37 421.15 B: (( [noise] )) 

420.76 434.76 A: you know but they're they're still they're still making a salary i i know whenever i go to work like you say if if i'm not performing you know just recently i wasn't performing the way they wanted me to well you know that my salary wasn't cut i was fired 

434.09 435.83 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

435.21 438.58 A: you know plain and simple yeah 

437.37 448.95 B: or they could say no i know like in my own job you know and i'm not if i'm not doing everything right when i get my reviews they say okay no raise and i'm like well but i've been doing so much good and they're like yeah but you haven't been doing everything we expect 

448.79 452.93 A: everything right right right 

449.30 450.03 B: so 

451.24 454.85 B: you have to get that perfect rating [noise] to get the raise you want 

454.86 456.54 A: yeah what kind of work do you do 

456.50 458.27 B: i'm a retail supervisor 

457.98 459.14 A: (( uh okay ))

484.98 496.36 B: but then again [noise] there again there's and they're some of the worst examples they make all this money [noise] but [noise] i mean a lot of those guys aren't the greatest people and these kids are these guys are role models for people 

496.17 508.91 B: these are the kids that everyone wants their clothes they want to dress the same way as them act the same way as them these people are being paid millions of dollars and you know you'd think that they'd be like oh you're going to have to clean up your act a little before we give you all this money and let you be a role model 

496.24 497.82 A: oh yeah right 

508.34 519.66 A: yeah yeah well i think we got maybe a couple of them but i i i i don't see them doing you know uh what you say is part of this you know being real role models and being out there in the community i know
