0.10 1.13 B: joe 

0.33 1.49 A: (( hello )) 

2.12 2.93 B: (( yeah )) 

2.29 3.44 A: i'm john 

3.44 4.38 B: i'm joe 

4.76 5.87 A: (( just a minute joe )) 

6.51 12.55 A: so uh yeah i guess we're supposed to talk about uh they like to talk about nine eleven 

13.02 13.94 B: (( okay )) 

13.09 15.94 A: indirectly of course on this thing 

14.93 15.88 B: mhm 

16.55 17.42 B: okay 

16.63 17.59 A: because 

18.01 22.68 A: it just seems like uh this is like the third this is the third time of doing it and uh 

22.69 25.90 A: each time they think they uh they're talking about uh 

26.68 29.94 A: uh some kind of terrorist events 

30.00 30.87 B: okay 

31.22 32.80 A: (( but uh i don't know )) 

33.26 36.63 A: so what do you think about uh the topic 

37.21 46.33 B: well it it can only help right i i think that you know the the more we do it at at the airports and at the uh you know at the security check points the the better off it is 

46.81 49.43 A: yeah i i guess i agree 

49.63 59.86 A: uh but i don't think it should be like the only uh safety precautions or some of the that should be taken i don't think it should be like the overbearing fear 

60.26 61.86 A: because like 

61.97 67.86 A: they're go- probably going to try a different way of attacking if they try next time you know what i mean 

67.81 74.48 B: oh abso- absolutely absolutely but i think that it is i think it's the first step you know you've got to take baby steps before you can run 

69.92 70.75 A: (( right )) 

74.56 75.47 B: (( and uh uh )) 

74.62 75.78 A: yeah 

75.86 83.63 B: you know i think i think we're going in the right direction there's always more to be done but uh it depends on how much the federal government wants to spend to get it done 

84.27 86.50 A: yeah nah 

86.55 92.13 A: they're not going to i don't know like bush i i i don't really like him i supported him in the war 

91.97 93.03 B: mhm 

92.28 96.33 A: but that's about it but uh yeah 

96.65 99.13 A: i mean i was i uh 

99.14 100.79 A: i have my gray slip 

101.30 108.45 A: but he's he's doing an okay job he's doing a lot better than i thought i have to give him that much credit but uh 

101.58 102.39 B: (( yeah )) 

105.60 106.38 B: that 

107.79 108.35 B: (( yeah )) 

108.86 118.85 B: i i just think that the people that did the hiring at the at the check points i think they could do a better job of the screening you know they're we're still having problems with uh you know getting the right people to do the job 

108.99 109.94 A: yeah 

118.76 124.13 A: yeah yeah like i have they even uh implemented that uh 

124.31 134.65 A: um that door checking thing like like the door it's supposed to be like st- really s- like s- solid like it's supposed to be steel right 

127.50 128.69 B: uh that 

134.09 135.39 B: (( mhm )) 

134.80 137.07 A: i don't think they implemented that yet 

136.79 138.98 B: absolutely not no 

138.49 143.09 A: and i mean how long ago was that said that that was going to be done 

142.95 145.10 B: (( yeah yeah that was )) 

144.02 144.71 A: (( was )) 

145.68 152.28 B: they definitely have to they have to they have to improve it you know and uh they can't just keep on talking about it they have to get it done 

145.94 146.81 A: so 

152.12 159.38 A: i mean overseas in like japan if you when you get off like say if i'm going to uh 

160.10 160.85 B: (( [noise] )) 

160.17 161.61 A: uh 

161.75 165.17 A: tokyo or some some place within japan 

165.09 165.95 B: mhm 

165.32 169.70 A: so i go to like tokyo and then i want to go to another place 

169.73 170.69 B: mhm 

169.78 171.48 A: in uh japan 

171.80 180.33 A: then uh i have when i get out of the airport before i get on the other next the other plane i have to get screened again 

178.50 179.31 B: right 

180.29 182.12 B: right did 

181.16 188.27 A: you know like but here if like you get let off you could just go directly to your next flight 

185.80 186.52 B: (( right )) 

188.17 190.53 B: yep absolutely 

189.19 196.39 A: and uh that that's just that's just an example of how uh things are different overseas than over here 

196.45 210.70 B: and israel hasn't i mean we should take uh a page out of their book they got the best security screening they got the best uh you know uh their airlines are built the best to to avert you know divert terrorism you know we should use some of their uh their plans 

210.66 216.22 A: yeah i i would definitely have to agree with that 'cause i haven't really heard of too many uh 

216.38 220.73 A: israel uh israeli flights been hijacked 

220.21 223.32 B: they've had they've only had one in the last twenty five years 

223.76 230.68 A: that that's that's a very very good uh [laughter] record right there [noise] 

227.65 229.69 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

229.75 232.76 B: absolutely absolutely 

230.96 234.57 A: so there's no touching that 'cause it 

233.72 234.69 B: no 

235.19 242.07 A: i mean 'cause like that's definitely a it it seems to be that that seems to be like a terrorist's uh 

242.42 248.37 A: choice way of attack if you will just because like like right after uh 

244.59 246.65 B: (( mhm absolutely )) 

248.77 253.74 A: right after turkey gave uh the u._s. um fly over 

253.53 254.59 B: (( mhm )) 

253.79 259.41 A: um things they got hijacked like one one of their airplanes got hijacked 

256.30 257.20 B: yep 

258.90 261.29 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

260.17 268.37 A: so uh i mean i it just seems to be that that is al qaeda's choice way of uh 

268.41 271.96 A: that and like suicide bombers 

272.28 274.57 A: into like u._s. embassies 

275.03 276.16 A: so 

275.20 275.96 B: (( yeah )) 

276.21 277.42 B: absolutely 

276.32 277.27 A: yeah 

277.42 278.67 A: but uh 

277.76 278.89 B: (( that proves )) 

279.63 283.94 A: yeah i guess that more needs to be done definitely more needs to be done 

283.83 293.27 B: absolutely and i i think that's you know that they should be worrying about that a lot more than uh you know the unemployment and i think you know that that 'cause 

284.34 285.42 A: on that 

293.17 307.91 B: terrorism affects everything and if there's if there's a terrorist attack and then you know we lose more buildings hypothetically that means there's more unemployment you know they they should they should look at that should be their number one priority right now is you know trying to keep us safe 

307.87 321.26 A: yeah that's not going to be bush's main priority though his main priority is trying to get the economy in shape before the election because uh that's like if they get the economy gets back in shape before the election 

321.09 332.39 A: then there's a s- really good chance he'll get reelected and if it's not then h- there's a good chance that he won't but on the same note if there's another terrorist attack 

324.47 325.43 B: (( [noise] right )) 

332.36 344.03 A: well i i guess they really can't count it on because they don't exactly know if there's another terrorist attack if people would vote bush out person- i'm voting bush out anyways [laughter] but uh 

344.15 358.78 A: um if there's another terrorist attack well people will say oh we're still being under attack or we we need to keep bush in there or are they saying bush isn't doing his job about keeping the country safe and we need to get bush out of there 

358.55 359.94 B: right 

359.35 366.27 A: so i i don't know that that's a topsy turvy thing you know that would be determined by that would be determined by the media 

366.35 367.45 B: absolutely 

366.54 373.08 A: 'cause the media wants to uh portray i swear the media runs this country did did you follow the war 

372.64 374.96 B: (( yeah absolutely )) 

374.75 378.24 A: well it just the way i was watching c._n._n. 

378.52 383.35 A: and just the way they worded their questions 

383.36 386.73 A: made you think that we were losing the war 

387.27 389.73 A: that's how subtle these guys are 

389.39 391.17 B: (( [noise] right they )) 

390.20 398.04 A: you know they they and and it's very very hard to say to call them on that you know say wait a second that's b._s. 

398.29 400.37 A: they they they really uh 

400.69 407.83 A: they really do uh a good job huh about being s- like sneaky about controlling people's minds 

407.45 421.83 B: oh absolutely the media media runs the you know the politicians they run they run the people's thoughts you know everything goes through the media they can they can change you know change a couple of words and they can sound positive or negative and then everybody believes it immediately 

420.68 430.03 A: this yep i it's it's really sad um i actually i have this really nice surround sound system and everything i disconnected my t._v. 

429.97 431.07 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

430.35 435.84 A: i don't have a t- i i have a t._v. it's in my closet right now i've just been doing schoolwork 

434.19 435.28 B: (( [laughter] )) 

435.72 436.64 B: right 

436.01 444.26 A: and like first really for the exception of missing twenty four i i have no regrets [laughter] 

442.45 455.05 B: [laughter] yes but what i definitely do definitely think they should be doing more you know to uh to divert terrorism and you know and definitely have to do a better job at the airports because you know if 

454.87 459.13 B: if it was even living in new york you know the bridges and everything now 

458.98 472.64 B: they they they don't have the national guard there any more you know they're not stopping the trucks any more you know it was for the first couple of months when everybody was still worried about it and now everybody's kind of backed off and forgot about it which is what you know shouldn't happen 

472.58 479.28 A: oh yeah i mean like totally like i i totally agree with you like that the whole uh 

479.45 485.34 A: i mean never s- was there a sense of patriotism like after nine eleven 

485.36 490.41 A: and then after a few months it seemed like it was all gone 

490.27 495.69 B: yeah well i think what it is i think people wanted wanted to forget about it you know it was such a horrible experience 

490.58 491.40 A: like 

495.50 505.95 B: it's like anything in life you know when you you try to block it out and pretend it never happened and uh that's the wrong way to go about it i think we should be taking a much more aggressive approach to everything 

504.69 510.19 A: y- you have to learn about you have to learn ab- uh from your mistakes and it's just 

509.17 510.84 B: absolutely 

510.22 512.84 A: i mean that i mean you just have to 

512.85 514.18 B: yeah 

513.85 527.65 A: and uh yeah you're absolutely right 'cause like i mean i'd like me- or after the war started patriots i saw the patriotism level kind of go up a little bit but then there was all the anti war people 

523.85 524.73 B: mhm 

527.43 528.29 B: right 

527.64 541.91 A: that that like i mean don't know like peo- people would argue that they were more patriotic because they didn't want the troops to fight or something like that but [noise] i mean i don't know i supported it personally 

528.90 529.47 B: (( [cough] )) 

541.78 547.76 A: and i fail to see i i haven't talked to anybody 

548.42 557.39 A: that had a real good reason that opposed the war except for the people who were just against war like that was just their thing they were like against all war 

551.77 552.66 B: right 

557.22 558.05 B: yeah 

557.39 564.79 A: you know and i'm like all right well if that's the way you are well then that's that's the thing i mean i can't argue that you know but uh 

564.88 569.29 A: like they couldn't give me any like logical reason why 

569.39 570.65 A: uh 

571.00 572.18 A: the war 

571.36 581.44 B: [noise] but it no they're just anti war protesters you know and no matt- no matter what if the one mind no matter what it is you know they they think that there's another way around it when sometimes there's not you know 

574.24 575.31 A: yeah 

580.84 595.11 A: well and a lot of people they're just like totally like anti bush anti bush and i mean like come on would you at least think before you act you know what i mean like it's that that really kind of ticks me off because when people are on 

595.04 599.89 A: like have the same point of view as me but they go to the extreme without think
