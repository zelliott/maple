7.18 10.74 A: hi my name's david i'm from los angeles california 

11.70 12.91 B: [lipsmack] how're you doing 

12.74 13.95 A: (( good how 'bout you )) 

13.75 14.77 B: okay 

14.87 16.78 A: (( all right )) 

15.76 17.08 B: (( um i )) 

18.82 24.47 B: don't know i- i think a l- a lot of my life has changed since september eleventh uh 

24.65 35.09 B: here in the washington d._c. area we had sniper attacks uh last october and it just reminded me of you know how scary everything is 

28.54 29.44 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

34.83 36.29 A: yeah 

35.61 36.68 B: um 

37.31 39.73 B: [lipsmack] i'm very careful where i go 

39.86 42.90 B: you know watching people around me 

42.95 45.01 B: i was also uh 

45.18 49.72 B: [lipsmack] my purse or my wallet was stolen in our metro system 

49.78 56.78 B: um last may and you know all of it just made me think of how careful i need to be 

57.02 60.18 B: uh and how precious life is 

59.26 61.17 A: (( [noise] mm mhm yeah )) 

61.82 62.97 B: how 'bout you 

62.11 75.72 A: uh that's interesting yeah um well i i remember watching the sniper attacks and all that going unfolding and everything um i think my life has changed not significantly but in a way 

75.78 80.54 A: like i'm more cautious and it's kinda sad but i- you know um 

81.06 84.21 A: if i see uh someone you know of 

84.55 94.89 A: uh that looks maybe suspicious in any type of way i i get a funny feeling and you know i don't think that's right that i should but it's almost like that's just the way i react to it you know 

94.67 101.09 B: um you're absolutely right i mean it's it's kind of unfair to to think that you judge people on how they look 

100.03 109.30 A: yeah because i don't like to be the type that stereotypes or anything 'cause i think it's all th- there's always your exception and that everything goes to it but 

109.23 112.25 A: i- it's almost just how i feel and i'm 

112.02 118.40 A: i'm flying to philadelphia in a couple of weeks and it's almost kinda scary that i'm like now that i'm going on a plane [noise] 

118.20 128.15 A: you know like before it was like i was scared to get on a plane maybe just a little bit you know i had the feeling and i was like what happens if the plane something like that but now i'm thinking 

127.95 133.41 A: what happens if a guy has a bomb in his shoe or something ridiculous like that 

132.24 137.58 B: right well i flew about a month after september eleventh and that was very scary for me 

135.39 136.23 A: (( mm )) 

136.74 139.05 A: (( oh yeah i bet )) 

138.04 141.76 B: i have flown a number of times since then and uh 

142.53 155.22 B: [mn] uh my feelings about flying have calmed down considerably i mean they've taken such measures since september eleventh to ensure safety uh you know and i see that the airports and uh 

148.36 149.29 A: yeah 

155.36 163.04 B: i've uh you know the fact that the pilots uh have secured the doors and uh 

160.45 164.49 A: mhm yeah they did they do that to all of them to have 

164.23 176.40 B: i believe they have and also uh here in the d. c. area we have washington reagan national uh airport and any flight in a in or out of there uh carries an air marshall 

164.56 166.08 A: (( like )) 

171.45 172.40 A: uh-huh 

176.12 179.55 A: oh yeah that was another thing that yeah that they put in 

178.06 182.26 B: yeah and i actually sat n- next to an air marshall one day i i 

181.50 187.13 A: oh did you do they do they have like a badge like stating what they are or they're under over 

182.35 183.25 B: yeah 

184.80 186.45 B: no they don't 

186.73 198.66 B: they're completely under cover but he was searching for his headphones and he leaned forward and i saw the gun in the back of his pants [laughter] so i n- know that he had to be the air marshall 

188.19 189.37 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

194.93 196.30 A: oh wow 

197.85 201.27 A: yeah [laughter] i sure hope so [laughter] at least 

201.51 212.45 B: so uh yeah a a lot has changed uh you know i'm definitely not as easy going as i was uh before september eleventh because of the things that have happened 

204.36 206.16 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

208.82 210.41 A: mhm 

212.03 213.23 A: yeah 

212.39 226.83 B: and i also drove by the pentagon you know living right here in the d._c. area uh a month or so after it happened and saw the big hole in the building and uh you know all the burned area it was a very sobering experience [laughter] 

216.09 218.32 A: (( mm mhm )) 

220.85 221.77 A: (( oh )) 

226.41 228.83 A: i bet i mean gee 

228.62 236.87 B: uh also on september eleventh the company i work for uh eleven people were killed uh in one of the uh 

236.91 239.67 B: um twin towers in new york 

239.14 240.44 A: oh oh wow 

240.05 242.89 B: [lipsmack] so uh you know nobody i knew 

241.15 246.20 A: yeah so it's really impacted being on the east coast it's really hit home with you yeah mhm mhm 

245.33 260.21 B: uh yeah yeah it has and it makes you very very cautious uh you know a- like you said about watching people around you your surroundings uh what you actually do you know you don't do really stupid things [laughter] any more 

246.33 248.08 A: yeah 

257.66 259.64 A: yeah 

259.77 260.78 A: (( i know )) 

260.94 262.75 A: yeah 

261.96 268.87 B: so uh it's you know it's probably had a little less effect uh on you in the los angeles area 'cause every 

267.67 270.36 A: uh-huh it but it almost makes me feel like 

270.28 283.65 A: are we next you know you know 'cause we're in the just on the opposite side of you and we're so highly populated and and just as you are and i- it's scary you know we don't have the capital over here i understand that but still 

283.47 294.17 B: right well you're you're right and you know the fact that they keep raising and lowering the terrorist alert uh you know makes it makes it somewhat scary um 

289.63 291.58 A: mhm 

294.20 305.25 B: you know i i set up a room in my house called the safe room uh you know fortunately i haven't had to use it uh and i th- i think a little bit less about it every day now but 

304.53 305.43 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

305.36 311.84 B: you know every time s- something happens or uh you know they raise the terror alert like they've done now 

311.44 312.34 A: uh-huh 

311.98 315.28 B: you know i- it really makes you think about what you're doing [laughter] 

314.64 316.64 A: definitely 

317.10 318.34 A: (( definitely it does [mn] )) 

319.71 320.90 B: so 

321.46 322.42 B: (( uh um )) 

322.97 329.21 B: the company that i work for also was on se- uh before september eleventh we were moving um 

329.36 336.38 B: [lipsmack] one of our offices into the world trade center they were scheduled to move the f- the week after the terrorist attack 

331.74 332.93 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

335.83 337.31 A: oh wow 

336.54 339.51 B: and i was really scared that day that uh 

339.71 346.87 B: um you know people were actually in the building that i would know uh because they were moving equipment in there [laughter] 

346.96 351.25 B: uh so and you know after september eleventh you couldn't get hold of anyone 

350.73 352.33 A: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] yeah )) 

351.46 360.02 B: uh so uh you know it was a very scary time and i saw it on television too i s- i i went to look at the television at work 

360.05 365.87 B: right after it happened and so i saw the second plane you know fly into the second building 

365.08 367.26 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

366.13 368.79 B: uh and of course everything after that 

368.59 371.54 A: yeah i just woke up when that happened 

370.94 373.86 B: oh yeah yeah you would've been three hours behind 

373.12 376.22 A: exactly yeah i i remember coming uh 

373.93 374.80 B: yeah 

376.34 387.38 A: to the table to eat breakfast and turning on the t._v. and watching it and it was just devastating i couldn't believe it but i'm a student right now so i went to school that day 

383.52 385.04 B: yeah it also 

387.02 387.96 B: uh-huh 

387.66 393.70 A: and but i left early um 'cause it was just so scary i was talking to family and everything 

389.15 390.18 B: yeah well 

393.12 407.45 B: oh absolutely and and my daughter that day was in atlanta and she was scheduled to fly home or you know [mn] she actually lives in ohio but she was scheduled to fly from atla- atlanta to ohio and of course all the planes were grounded 

399.61 400.60 A: (( uh-huh )) 

401.35 402.20 A: okay 

406.60 408.56 A: yeah 

407.49 418.24 B: uh so you know it makes you think twice about flying and uh just [mn] even doing your everyday normal routine you know you're l- looking at everybody and [lipsmack] 

415.24 417.06 A: mhm 

418.72 421.02 B: and everything that's going on 

420.83 424.01 A: yeah do you think it's united us in any type of way 

423.80 425.19 B: oh definitely 

424.58 426.29 A: yeah 

425.21 431.24 B: definitely i i think people especially in the d._c. area were a lot more courteous and 

430.62 431.57 A: uh-huh 

431.17 440.66 B: i i still think they are uh after september eleventh 'cause it made you think you know how lucky you were to be alive this this could've been you and uh 

432.85 434.47 A: yeah 

438.07 452.08 A: yeah i remember driving around that day and looking over at some lane we just looked at each other in our cars going like wow this is incredible you know but you had that feeling with them that you know they were going through the same as you were 

447.48 448.48 B: yes 

452.04 454.60 A: and it did i think it brought us together 

454.31 460.17 B: oh absolutely uh i think people treat other people with much more respect 

455.96 456.61 A: (( uh )) 

460.30 471.63 B: uh and much more courtesy you know e- even in driving you know people i- in the d._c. area at least and i'm sure probably in los angeles it's such a hurry type mode um 

462.71 464.31 A: yeah 

470.56 471.89 A: yeah [laughter] 

471.65 476.34 B: you know and people sometimes ha- can be incredibly rude when when they're [laughter] driving 

475.96 478.04 A: hm definitely [laughter] 

476.48 482.39 B: ju- just to get ahead and you know i think a lot of that has changed since september eleventh 

478.26 479.41 A: definitely 

482.35 484.11 A: yeah 

484.48 485.36 B: so 

485.00 488.60 A: i think it's gone down a little bit since 

488.96 503.21 A: but you'll be driving you'll see billboards of it you know like remember and you know all these type of things and on the back of people's cars the flags and you know nine eleven a- and it just makes you think of that time like oh yeah you know 'cause 

502.07 507.58 B: right a lot of people have taken down their flags and stuff i still have uh our company made uh 

507.63 522.04 B: uh copied flags on a on a copier and passed them out to everyone who wanted it and i still have those on my car although i did take down my flag off my house it was getting filthy [laughter] uh but uh 

509.39 511.07 A: mhm 

514.77 515.80 A: (( yeah that's )) 

518.44 520.51 A: (( good mhm [laughter] )) 

521.45 524.13 A: i've even seen people out here get 'em um 

524.49 531.85 A: [lipsmack] permanently like put into their cars on the back of their cars stuff like that and that was very interesting to see 

529.52 530.92 B: well i think i think 

531.25 540.32 B: yeah i think it's neat to see people with flags on their cars and you see a lot more signs today too um [lipsmack] you know su- support the troops and 

533.74 535.01 A: yeah 

539.66 540.82 A: (( definitely mhm )) 

540.36 549.24 B: uh you know i believe in the united states and uh it's it has provided a a great feeling uh 

548.63 550.30 A: yeah 

549.77 554.48 B: uh 'cause you may have thought this initially but you know after september eleventh 

554.54 556.58 B: you think about it a whole lot more 

557.61 563.79 A: mm well i think before i didn't think about it at all you know that can never happen to us no no never 

562.62 568.88 B: well no i don't think anyone ever thought that anything like that would e- no one could even dream that that would have happened [laughter] 

565.97 570.27 A: yeah no yeah exactly 

569.71 573.31 B: uh but i've always been pretty patriotic but uh 

573.33 574.92 B: even more so now 

574.58 576.58 A: yeah definitely 

574.98 577.11 B: really proud to be an american

585.99 587.84 A: (( it hasn't )) 

586.69 587.62 B: uh 

587.90 599.89 B: no you know i like i said i watch out [mn] my surroundings and i think everything that's happened to me including having my wallet stolen and you know seeing everything on september eleventh
