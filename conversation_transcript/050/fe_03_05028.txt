30.77 31.63 B: me too 

31.83 41.05 A: and you know like whether it's on the internet articles on the internet or um [mn] or just you know a local paper um 

40.02 40.73 B: yep 

41.32 46.05 A: and that's probably you know like as far as like information and then 

46.33 50.99 A: god it's so hard to put a finger on what a what a really broad type of thing 

49.81 51.19 B: well do you ah 

51.47 58.26 B: is there anything like ah do you travel less or do you do you not fly or initially did you do that or 

57.59 69.98 A: well that's an excellent question um no i that that never that never was a factor for me um i think i think within a few months after after september i was i was i made a couple of flights 

62.09 63.31 B: oh okay right 

69.97 77.83 A: and ever since then i mean i i fly fairly frequently um it's none of it's business but i still do that what about you 

78.29 82.25 B: that that was probably the only that it really significantly is 

82.73 88.55 B: ah initially afterward like for thanksgiving i didn't i normally fly home to florida 

87.96 88.93 A: uh-huh 

88.67 92.10 B: and i i didn't do that i live in new york city so it 

92.29 93.26 A: okay 

92.87 97.51 B: i i didn't know anyone there or anything i mean but i was here when it happened so it was 

94.68 95.59 A: uh-huh 

98.41 103.91 B: you know traumatic but [mn] i'm still here in new york city so i didn't move or anything 

101.61 103.47 A: right 

104.26 106.40 A: well what an interesting topic for you 

106.20 107.14 B: where do you live 

107.02 110.54 A: i'm in california right now but i'm from virginia 

109.63 110.58 B: oh okay 

110.80 122.76 A: my um i have a fraternity brother actually who was who was killed in one of the world trade towers and um i know it was [mn] it's so awful and um 

116.55 117.67 B: [mn] i'm sorry 

123.04 135.48 A: a bunch of a bunch of guys in the fraternity he was a little bit older than me so mainly his friends like from around his year they set up a scholarship fund um in his name along with his family um 

135.64 137.35 A: in our fraternity and then 

137.67 140.87 A: you know we're we've been raising money um 

140.93 149.73 A: you know for the past two years um when we do our normal philanthropy we've been raising money for that too so that's probably another like very specific way um 

143.27 144.24 B: that's great 

149.75 154.53 A: i actually knew a couple more people involved too and i know that they're 

154.56 159.75 A: they were more friends with my mom and i i guess for her um she's been 

160.21 168.12 A: probably the last two years ah a lot of time with um this couple whose are really good friends and i can i can tell you that for them it's just as 

168.35 171.82 A: it's probably the the single most um 

172.17 178.39 A: memorable and [mn] i guess influential you know event that that happened in their lives 

178.58 181.95 B: do you you said you travel a lot do you travel abroad 

182.22 183.41 A: um 

183.45 186.97 A: s- since then i haven't but i i have done 

187.13 190.29 A: a lot of travel abroad in the past not since then though 

189.96 193.05 B: did you restrict it because of the ah attack 

192.37 193.86 A: no no 

194.24 195.07 A: no 

194.96 200.14 B: no what about ah like ah politics have your political views changed 

200.29 202.80 A: ah political views changed since then 

204.43 210.60 A: a little bit i'm kind of a [laughter] i'm kind of a skeptical paranoid person 

210.15 214.08 B: mhm [mn] ah this i imagine this event didn't help that 

213.66 216.82 A: no [laughter] not at all 

216.90 218.49 A: and um 

217.71 221.05 B: (( [laughter] ah c- c- confirmation of a conspiracy theory mhm [noise] )) 

220.23 229.36 A: [laughter] nothing like that really but it ma- it really makes me it makes me wonder about you know just political agendas and how much how much 

229.86 243.10 A: not so much the the actual you know event itself as a conspiracy but more of how something like this can be used in order to further certain things that really are done um 

243.11 245.39 A: seemingly without compassion 

245.59 251.02 B: you know it's funny my my political views have probably changed the exact opposite [noise] 

251.15 262.29 B: where i was once more skeptical of kind of international military escapades and intrigue and c._i._a. assassination and all that kind of stuff 

253.87 255.07 A: (( hm )) 

257.58 258.59 A: uh-huh 

261.56 264.03 A: right right right 

262.36 265.29 B: i'm more likely to 

266.09 272.21 B: [mn] not obviously not be in favor of all of it ah with a carte blanche to go around the world and do whatever they want 

271.60 273.03 A: right 

272.61 277.93 B: but my my new self would be regarded as a fascist warmonger by my old self 

276.82 278.72 A: [laughter] 

279.24 289.33 A: [laughter] that's funny so wh- so i guess you've been are you i mean do you have any like any family members or friends that were have been soldiers 

281.66 282.73 B: so 

289.27 296.72 B: i do well i i have a friend in the air force but he he wasn't called up someone from my office was called up for ah [mn] to go in iraq 

296.35 298.24 A: mhm 

297.21 306.38 B: but my friend in the air force he's just he's just a bureaucrat and he he was ready to go i can't remember to stand by or whatever it was but they they haven't called him but 

305.22 307.31 A: mhm mhm 

306.61 307.88 B: he's the only one 

307.92 310.37 B: everyone everyone in my family's retired 

310.47 313.75 B: [noise] or anyone who's was in the military's retired what about you 

310.89 311.92 A: okay so 

312.88 320.54 A: right no i i don't have anybody in my family i i've got ah just one friend though that's over there in iraq right now 

320.15 320.98 B: uh-huh 

321.17 331.12 A: so would you say that you're pretty much in support of i guess all of the all of the foreign policy that's been going on in the last couple of years but especially a few months 

330.41 337.72 B: not necessarily i actually was in ah a heated discussion on this very subject last night with my sister and brother in law [mn] um 

336.14 337.39 A: hm 

338.26 346.80 B: i i think that there is a conspiracy and i never would have believed this but there's kind of an international terrorist [noise] conspiracy against the united states 

346.34 348.09 A: right 

346.92 359.36 B: and that we have to act internationally in order to stop it [mn] [mn] now the specifics of what that means whether or not invading an entire country and teeing it setting up an entire new regime there is a good idea to me it certainly seems like it is 

349.92 351.68 A: right 

357.09 358.26 A: mhm 

359.52 364.54 B: consciously part of a plan to dismantle that international conspiracy 

363.93 365.81 A: right 

364.97 368.93 B: i remember reading stuff about what ah cheney and um 

369.82 381.10 B: rumsfeld's view of the world post soviet collapse and i remember regarding that view as paranoid their concept of rogue states acting in concert 

374.98 376.74 A: mhm 

377.27 379.05 A: mhm 

381.21 387.59 B: and just from the news i've been reading like you said you starting reading a lot of the papers after it i became a news junkie afterward 

387.00 388.89 A: yeah 

387.94 395.93 B: it really does seem to me that they really do trade resources and information and weapons and they really are united in one 

396.88 400.19 B: ah common view against the united states [mn] uh-huh 

398.74 403.63 A: mhm yeah i really have to say that i agree with you um 

403.67 410.16 A: on that i actually i forget i i travelled down to brazil um about a month and a half ago 

410.19 424.76 A: and i could really tell i i've been there before and the sentiment towards people from the united states ha- was so in- incredibly different when i went down there just these past few months 

423.82 424.97 B: right 

424.53 427.90 A: [mn] i mean it was so incredibly different than 

427.21 431.56 B: (( ah are you talking about they they've become more hostile or friendly [mn] )) 

430.18 433.78 A: not not hostile oh yeah more hostile 

433.45 434.68 B: oh okay [noise] 

434.04 443.07 A: not more friendly and it's it was funny for it was really a big shock to me and to get when i went down there before um 

442.86 457.19 A: i i stayed with some friends and everything was just i don't know everything was just really really nice and most people that found out that i was an american would um [mn] would be more interested in talking to me i probably got a lot more attention than i normally would have 

457.27 469.54 A: then when i went down there recently it was almost the exact opposite of that i alm- i felt like in a lot of ways and i'm not sure of how how much of this is like was my own baggage that i was carrying with me i felt like i had to kind of um 

469.87 474.14 A: like prove myself to some people like as soon as they heard you know my accent or [lipsmack] 

472.69 473.46 B: right 

474.36 476.91 A: or whatever and that it it's really 

474.53 475.77 B: [mn] right 

475.87 480.01 B: i've heard that some people when they travel americans now that they say they're canadian 

480.16 482.15 B: so they don't get into trouble 

480.20 483.25 A: [laughter] really 

482.34 486.46 B: yeah you didn't hear about that oh i'm canadian 

484.90 488.06 A: (( i don't know if i i yeah )) 

487.05 488.95 B: like that that gives you an excuse 

488.36 491.21 A: i don't know wo- would you stoop that low charlie 

489.18 489.86 B: (( [noise] )) 

490.52 492.15 B: no i don't think so 

491.45 493.23 A: [laughter] i'm just kidding 

492.82 498.45 B: yeah it is funny though i i have become you know more more touchy about that subject and more 

498.60 504.34 B: you know i never thought of myself as patriotic or anything like that but definitely more so now 

500.76 502.11 A: right 

504.17 507.21 A: yeah no i i really do agree with you 

507.45 509.33 A: have you noticed that um 

509.38 511.79 B: um i don't call them freedom fries by the way 

511.45 517.81 A: yeah [laughter] [laughter] have you noticed i i know that um probably you know 

511.98 513.43 B: they're still french fries 

517.83 530.92 A: within like the four months following september two thousand and one um there was you know the patriotism and kind of i guess unity any any sentiment along those lines were at at their highest do 

530.23 531.84 B: right 

530.92 532.88 A: you feel like things have changed 

534.01 541.01 B: well i think that they've changed internationally because that unity was really pretty much international at least across 

541.74 548.61 B: ah western ah the western countries like europe and canada and even parts of south america 

545.06 547.13 A: mhm mhm 

548.04 549.63 A: mhm 

548.75 551.92 B: but that evaporated almost immediately afterward 

551.35 553.15 A: yeah 

553.22 555.65 A: but what about go ahead 

553.35 554.32 B: i really 

554.96 556.51 B: (( what what what were you gonna say )) 

556.25 558.25 A: i was gonna ask you about the um 

558.92 560.04 A: i guess 

560.44 567.09 A: the idea of you know i guess like there's that whole controversy over you know france doesn't had decided not to 

566.88 581.39 A: show any support with [mn] us going to war and you know now that now that it seems like the war is at its it's at the very end and that it's like it was almost like a total success from a certain point of view 

581.04 593.89 B: [noise] oh i think it's a grand success i think they've been humiliated and i didn't even understand not only did they not support they actively worked to thwart us and deliberately engaged in diplomatic subterfuge 

593.52 595.23 A: mhm 

594.01 599.89 B: which ah it baffled me and it seems that they had nothing to gain and they had everything to lose if if they were 

598.39 599.62 A: right
