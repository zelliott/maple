1.86 3.83 A: hi my name is aaron 

3.91 4.78 A: um 

5.02 8.84 A: have you [laughter] uh uh did you get the whole message i guess i said the 

8.85 14.03 A: the topic is have you made any changes in your life since september eleventh is that right [noise] 

12.60 15.78 B: [noise] yeah that's uh at least that's what it sounded like [laughter] 

14.82 15.97 A: okay 

16.09 19.48 A: um [mn] boy that's a tough one because um 

19.43 33.11 A: [lipsmack] i think a lot of times you have to [laughter] make more of a mental change than an actual physical changes in what you do with your life things uh i don't know i mean have you felt like you've been less likely to travel or anything like that 

32.10 44.66 B: [noise] actually not really um i've travelled more since actually um the i was kinda just like media sensitized to it in a way i've been to israel a few times been there through for a few attacks and you just kind of [sigh] 

35.91 37.18 A: (( [sigh] a- [noise] )) 

45.01 51.11 B: instead of seeing it as a horrible thing and you but there's no point in letting it stop me from living you know if 

50.28 51.78 A: right 

52.13 62.26 A: yeah you know i mean i just coincidentally i had a job before that like i'd ended it maybe a y- a year before the attacks where i used to travel all the time so 

59.65 60.35 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

62.17 69.66 A: and then it's it i just didn't anymore with this new job so my life had changed in that way but it's it's certainly not a result of that um 

68.61 71.22 B: (( [mn] [noise] [noise] they're just like circumstances [noise] )) 

70.42 76.42 A: yeah um [laughter] i mean it's just changing my job [laughter] so it had nothing to do with uh uh i 

76.65 90.09 A: i think uh well actually you know what there is definitely one change that's b- been made in my life [laughter] is i watch way more news on t._v. or read it on the internet or in the newspaper or whatever than i ever did before that i don't know [laughter] [mn] 

80.52 81.11 B: (( [noise] )) 

88.26 90.38 B: [lipsmack] definitely yeah [noise] 

91.22 99.79 B: i kind of stopped watching t._v. news a little bit after that 'cause it was a constant bombardment but i started looking for alternative sources uh reading news more often [noise] [noise] 

99.27 100.60 A: right 

100.63 113.73 A: um yeah an- and i guess i mean i don't know what it was really like that much before that but 'cause i never really looked at news on the internet before but i do all the time now and i i mean maybe there just is more of it than there was just because of th- 

101.36 102.85 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

113.93 120.04 A: the fact that the internet is growing so much too but that's something that's definitely i don't know if you see a lot of more that 

119.99 124.65 A: um i mean i'm not i'm wondering if you know if if this whole thing is 

124.57 137.05 A: i- it's changed things that have happened but i don't think it's changed my beliefs and things my own kinds of political values and skepticism and whatever seem to be the same as they ever were i mean maybe they're heightened a little bit in terms of the things that i notice 

136.84 138.36 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

137.17 143.82 A: o- or maybe that's just the result of other things that are happening i have a hard time figuring out if that's really the reason for that 

143.31 155.10 B: [noise] see afterwards a lot of and and my pol- political views pretty much stayed the same i became a little bit more active just because it's [noise] it's human necessity a lot of decisions are being made by a lot of people in power that just 

152.70 153.68 A: mhm 

155.39 157.35 B: it there's a lot and it was knee jerk 

157.36 168.00 B: and we decided to instantly just go after whoever we thought had any remote connection instead of people m- m- taking the time and finding out if there was actually a connection there and a lot of the country was at 

167.96 175.52 B: least in my opinion anybody that said anything against the administration was au- automatically anti un- unpatriotic and a bad person in general 

175.59 183.63 B: but i don't know i guess i mean really the only thing that's changed in a way is sort of i've it's more of a live for the moment 

183.76 184.62 B: uh 

183.94 185.23 A: right 

184.69 189.03 B: i think i can't think of the word right now i just got off of work [laughter] um this 

187.55 195.59 A: oh yes no i know what you mean [laughter] do you when you say um more active does it mean that you actually got involved in rallies or um 

195.01 203.95 B: [noise] s- started going to protests um started reading up a lot more attempting to get involved in politics in the area um [sigh] sh- yeah but mainly as a more 

203.06 206.74 A: i mean do you live somewhere where there is a lot of like activism [noise] 

206.11 208.99 B: yeah i live in center city philadelphia so 

208.17 209.17 A: uh-huh 

209.30 216.85 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] so there's a there's a- at that point there is always protests going on somewhere if when i saw the son- a cause i could 

213.41 214.55 A: right 

217.15 225.38 B: truly relate to and agree [noise] with then i could uh then i'd attend them instead of just sitting around before and saying oh it's not going to accomplish anything 

223.68 224.70 A: (( right [noise] )) 

225.74 234.53 B: you know just a matter of making a voice heard even if nothing changed we're just still saying we're not all for this we're not all against this we're we we have that individual voice [lipsmack] [noise] 

233.68 236.24 A: right yeah i mean i i 

236.51 240.75 A: [mn] i don't know how how this affects that sort of thing if maybe 'cause i 

241.10 246.73 A: i i just had my first boy m- you know my first child just a year before this all happened so 

244.24 244.89 B: mm 

246.81 259.57 A: a lot of things i would've done with the free time i used to have i couldn't do over the last couple of years i mean a lo- i think that if it wasn't for having to be a parent i probably would've been a lot more politically active kind of like you too 

259.42 260.99 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

259.61 260.56 A: um 

261.16 267.69 A: but i think it's more been a matter of just sharing my opinions with people and hoping that that helps a little bit than rather actually 

261.22 263.85 B: (( [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

267.85 268.89 A: um 

269.05 282.70 A: i- i mean than actually going out to the events and where i i live in um r- right next to cleveland and there there actually has been a lot of there have been a lot of events here too of that kind so there's been things happening but i haven't really been able to do 

282.77 285.83 A: what i normally would've i think in the past but 

285.32 288.76 B: yeah i'd say ha- having a kid definitely takes priority [laughter] 

288.08 289.14 A: yeah [laughter] 

288.68 294.25 B: that's necessity but no it's one of things i i have the free time so i can do it it's um 

290.46 291.32 A: (( [noise] )) 

294.04 307.51 B: other things that changed is a matter of getting back to school that became so much more of a priority for me to get back fulltime even for the point at where it's i want to get much more active than this so becoming a poli sci major hoping that that will lead somewhere [noise] and [noise] 

296.77 297.69 A: uh-huh 

303.06 304.66 A: (( [noise] right )) 

306.54 311.80 A: well if i mean if that's what you're studying then obviously [laughter] there's a connection do you do you think um 

311.76 322.70 A: [lipsmack] i guess that other part of this is do you think that the uh downturn in the economy i mean if you connect it with this at all i mean that's certainly affected everybody's life 

322.66 327.71 B: yeah that but that one of those things that's really hard to tell whether that was strictly uh the 

327.64 339.98 B: the the terrorist attacks or if that was a matter of like the three billion dollar tax cut where all of a sudden we went from having a surplus to a deficit i i think it had some effect on the economy just because people started to get worried they 

331.38 333.17 A: right 

339.85 351.52 B: a lot of people got paranoid they didn't want to go out and buy as much um places were laying off people left and right just 'cause they didn't have as much work for them and people became a lot more conservative with how they spent their money [noise] 

341.17 342.03 A: yeah 

350.95 362.53 A: yeah um i mean i think people have although i know i haven't [laughter] i mean i've i haven't really cut back on any of my spending even though i probably think it might have been the right thing to do but i think you're right other people did um 

362.64 377.23 B: [noise] mm i did to a point but it was more necessity it wasn't necessarily just i i was worried about anything as like a- bills to pay rent school tuition so cutting back on my spending really wasn't i- it was something forced upon me i didn't have th- the option 

363.67 364.66 A: i mean it's 

366.75 367.88 A: right 

370.12 371.89 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

376.64 381.31 A: [mn] yeah i mean i'm pretty cynical in the sense that i'd have i i really don't 

377.27 377.83 B: (( [noise] )) 

381.49 392.73 A: profess to know why the economy necessarily has its ups and downs i mean i agree with you that the tax cut was a terrible idea um i mean if that's what you're saying [laughter] um 

385.85 386.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

391.88 395.12 B: yeah it wasn't the best of ideas [laughter] at the time [noise] 

393.59 397.93 A: oh [laughter] i mean i think this one's even worse but um i 

398.20 406.28 A: i i i thing that and and that may be part of the cause of it i mean i think but i think there's certainly something to be said for that the attack 

406.35 409.89 A: killed the airline industries in certain ways and whatever so i mean i- 

409.84 424.75 A: if that's what they were aiming for [laughter] and so hitting our economy that the long term effect that's probably affected more people than the actual event itself did at the time um i mean i'm not making light of it or or or or anything just um 

420.49 422.09 B: yeah you s- [noise] 

424.00 437.91 B: oh no it's one of those things that definitely the the actual events themselves i really it didn't appear to me at least to have that much of an impact on most people uh for a couple of months after it was waving the flag and oh we're sad and then back to life as normal 

435.89 437.07 A: right 

437.75 443.24 B: but yeah it definitely did people stopped flying they got really i think the paranoia in a way 

443.47 453.19 B: went much further than it needed to and that's the long term effects of that is what we're feeling people don't want to fly people don't want to go places worried about spending money and mm 

448.85 449.92 A: right 

452.32 465.58 A: [sigh] i mean in my own cynicism i mean the thing you said about the you know pe- people being loyal or anti american and everything i i think that a lot of the paranoia was struck into us not by the terrorists but by our own government um [mn] 

464.40 467.97 B: yeah and by our own media definitely [noise] 

466.73 478.44 A: yeah that's yeah absolutely uh [laughter] i mean i i wonder i mean just to give an example like right now that the color coding terror alert system is at number four which 

479.14 486.08 A: do you i mean are you going to live any different when it's number four versus it's number three i mean i certainly haven't changed anything because of that 

483.95 485.03 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

485.09 494.29 B: actually at this point it's one of those things they uh they s- they push it up so often that it's just a matter of i i honestly don't even pay attention any more because i 

492.96 495.15 A: yeah it's almost like they're crying wolf 

494.86 501.21 B: yeah and if something is going to happen and i happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time there's not a lot i can about it so 

500.38 501.81 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

501.23 506.31 B: i'd kind of rather not have those regrets in those last few moments of my life [laughter] 

504.78 516.43 A: yeah i agree [laughter] i feel the same way about that um you know and i certainly there's a whole i'm more likely to walk out in the street and get hit by a bus than i am to get be a victim of a terrorist attack i think 

515.44 517.03 B: [noise] exactly [laughter] 

516.45 524.48 A: um i mean my mother in law lives in washington so i mean she's the only person who's close to me in any way who i think could be 

524.52 527.54 A: somehow affected by all this but 

527.55 528.97 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

527.78 538.68 A: uh i i i don't she doesn't seem to feel very worried about it i mean to be honest she was a lot more worried when there was the sniper going around in washington than she ever was by any of the terrorism alerts 

537.96 552.04 B: [noise] yeah 'cause that was more of a chance of getting hit by this guy going around with a gun than anything else and i don't know i guess i can't see philadelphia ever being a target we everything we have here's kind of small our biggest claim to fame is a bell that's already broken 

538.93 539.69 A: (( so )) 

540.97 542.02 A: right 

542.52 543.59 A: yeah [laughter] 

551.49 552.64 A: (( [noise] right )) 

552.06 554.41 B: [laughter] i just 

552.83 562.52 A: well i yeah i mean i feel the same way about cleveland it's like it seem the only way it could be a target is if the terrorists are smart enough to think if they just pick some random city and attack it 

562.29 576.38 A: then everybody's going to feel like they're viol- vulnerable but it certainly doesn't seem to be their method that i think they go for symbolism as much as they go for um the actual effect so i don't know yeah i w- i think tha- that's probably true 

565.37 567.07 B: yeah 

576.59 587.13 A: um i mean uh people in new york and washington probably have a lot more would have a lot more to say about this subject in that way than than either of us would i would think 

586.45 599.76 B: yeah mainly because it's they they they lived through it they were there and i don't know i spend a lot time but it's just not it's never uh since then it's never really been a concern i mean for a couple of days yeah it somewhat of a mess just because it's [sigh] 

589.59 590.52 A: right
