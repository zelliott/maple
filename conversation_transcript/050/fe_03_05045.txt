30.00 31.13 A: (( yeah )) 

32.46 38.52 A: [mn] i just think it's ridiculous that a school teacher don't make maybe thirty thirty five thousand dollars a year and then there's 

41.02 46.63 A: [sigh] [cough] actors and professional sports people that are making a million two million dollars 

44.81 46.33 B: millions yep

52.13 53.37 B: protest 

53.53 58.79 A: um nobody the owners and they'd love to be not pay 'em as much but 

59.65 61.12 B: [noise] gosh

74.84 75.80 B: okay 

76.63 77.79 B: military 

77.69 79.39 A: no truck driver

95.35 97.63 B: [laughter] oh okay 

96.61 100.33 A: i don't know i don't know if anybody is right now uh i know b- i 

101.19 105.16 A: think i heard something on the radio about baseball talking about striking again 

105.19 105.94 B: oh 

106.10 107.18 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

107.64 110.08 A: you know i think if the owners 

110.26 113.99 A: [mn] would put ads in the paper and on t._v. and say we'll give you 

113.73 114.31 B: (( [sigh] )) 

114.49 119.26 A: sixty thousand dollars a year to come play s- professional sports for us 

119.23 131.70 A: and give you thirty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life if you get injured or play long enough to retire they'd get enough people to replace everybody out there that's playing right now and have just as good a teams 

132.77 136.03 B: that is very true i don't know if they'd have just as good a teams 

135.51 138.99 A: well eventu- eventually they would 

136.05 142.72 B: but either way i think if they paid all the players less the players would deal with it or they just wouldn't play 

142.56 144.40 A: yeah 

142.99 146.72 B: i don't think they'd not want to play so i think they'd deal with [noise] [noise] 

145.02 146.34 A: well and if they 

146.43 153.74 A: you know if they give all the players sixi- uh sixty thousand dollars a year to play and thirty thousand a year after they retire 

154.09 157.60 A: they could play 'em for twenty years apiece and they'd still save money 

157.13 159.83 B: yeah that's still a lot of money though [sigh] 

159.25 161.32 A: and the price of tennis shoes would go down 

161.07 165.46 B: [laughter] hey there's a good idea then [noise] 

161.74 162.54 A: [laughter] 

164.98 169.49 A: yeah well it's just it's getting ridiculous the um 

169.62 173.08 A: you know i was watching this thing i can't even remember what show it was now 

173.20 181.54 A: but the professional sports players' getting more money for endorsements than they do for what they get paid for playing sports 

181.31 182.37 B: really 

182.15 183.63 A: well it's like uh 

183.87 187.02 A: what's that kid that golfs uh tiger woods

240.50 241.69 A: (( you know [mn] )) 

242.48 248.22 A: well yeah that's just it you know look at the poverty poverty level across the united states 

243.10 244.02 B: [laughter] 

245.73 246.56 B: yep 

247.29 250.73 B: yeah i think bill gates is right there with them he needs to share his too 

250.39 255.37 A: oh yeah you know it's like gareth brookes he said he could his 

255.53 258.74 A: i think he said fourth or fifth great grandchildren 

258.82 263.49 A: will never have to spend never have to work he's got so much money 

261.56 262.50 B: (( oh my )) 

262.87 264.18 B: goodness

282.97 291.39 A: and like a ten thousand dollar shopping spree at some place in new york city you know what's wrong with some of these other people doing this stuff

303.00 304.54 B: [noise] yeah but [mn] 

304.47 309.51 A: get hurt and not walk right ag- you know or not be able to bend over but still

313.21 314.69 A: getting shot at 

313.98 317.44 B: yeah yeah i think that's entirely a
