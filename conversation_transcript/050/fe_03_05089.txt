8.96 11.07 B: airport security business 

12.47 15.33 A: it's uh it's good i i'm all for it 

15.27 21.83 B: yeah i am too especially when now with um all the all the terrorist attack what we have i mean 

20.47 22.37 A: yeah it's kinda scary 

22.15 23.27 B: it is 

23.52 29.60 B: and um yeah i was i was uh flying uh about uh five years ago 

29.95 41.08 B: and um people were talking about how easy it was it sneak stuff in there like knives and stuff this was before that but um 

36.85 39.48 A: oh to hijack a plane yeah 

40.44 42.66 A: not anymore it's not easy anymore 

42.36 46.65 B: no so i'm glad to have the security now because uh fi- five years ago 

44.82 45.70 A: yeah 

46.83 50.87 B: they had um people could sneak knives and guns in there 

50.40 51.76 A: mhm 

51.29 53.59 B: (( can you imagine uh right now )) 

55.65 57.01 A: what's that 

56.54 61.02 B: can you imagine now what people can sneak if we didn't have the security 

60.51 63.86 A: yeah well because of the security i don't think they can get anything in 

63.92 65.53 B: oh no no way no 

66.55 74.06 B: but you know this my opinion i think still with all the security we have there slight little danger that still maybe somebody 

74.69 76.91 B: may sneak in something you know 

77.78 82.81 A: yeah maybe somebody wants to see if he can beat the system so they'll try 

83.51 85.58 B: yeah 

84.13 84.86 A: (( to )) 

86.39 90.89 A: but i just hope i don't ever i don't end up on a plane with a crackpot like that 

91.05 92.93 B: yeah do you fly often 

93.12 95.15 A: not really just to go uh 

95.55 100.70 A: go to school and back i'm on a leave of absence right now so i won't be going back for a while 

100.84 108.35 B: oh that's good yeah i fly once in a while um i go to conference and stuff so i i take a plane maybe two three times a year 

104.84 106.10 A: (( mm )) 

108.29 110.95 A: do you go across the country or what 

110.46 117.91 B: yes uh yeah sometimes and then all the security now you know it's a little pain in the in the behind but it's necessary though 

116.22 117.07 A: yeah 

117.76 118.97 A: right 

119.21 123.53 B: i'm all for it too because um you know you've gotta be safe on the plane right now 

124.92 127.43 B: [noise] it's better to be safe than sorry you know [laughter] 

127.09 128.45 A: yeah 

128.80 133.39 B: (( i was gonna ask you something about the security and i forgot darn it [mn] [noise] )) 

131.66 134.78 A: it's only bad for the people that are like 

135.02 137.60 A: carrying on weapons something like that 

137.73 140.73 B: oh yeah we- oh what do you think about um 

141.11 143.21 B: flight attendants and um 

143.23 145.34 B: and uh pilots getting guns 

146.47 147.54 A: i 

148.85 156.95 A: [noise] i just as soon they don't because if a flight attendant had a gun then some bad guy could like try take it away from them anyway 

157.39 163.42 A: and that'd be just as bad 'cause he it'd be easy for him to overpower a a flight attendant with a gun 

157.87 159.62 B: (( he'd [noise] )) 

163.90 169.06 B: yeah and also um how do we know that the flying attendant has um 

169.26 177.46 B: background or may be sympathetic to somebody who is not shouldn't be i don't know and you know never know with people and 

173.38 174.26 A: yeah 

176.04 178.98 A: yeah it's it's just best to keep the guns off the plane 

179.34 184.63 B: yeah unless you know that you are um undercover agent or 

184.29 185.91 A: yeah 

185.07 193.24 B: some are security you know but i think uh i think we should lock the door like in uh the copi- cockpit 

193.67 197.14 B: sho- nobody should be able to walk in or walk out 

193.79 195.00 A: (( oh yeah of course )) 

196.42 200.33 A: well the steward has stewardess has to go in there to feed them right 

199.54 204.76 B: [noise] oh yeah of course but i'm saying i think uh a problem before and i've seen uh 

204.95 208.11 B: uh people just going walking in 

208.24 213.08 B: trying to ask questions and stuff or being fool want trying to be a fool 

213.83 215.10 A: yeah 

215.23 218.50 B: uh if you've ever flying before you know the door was always open 

219.53 220.84 B: (( on the cockpit )) 

220.74 221.99 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

222.79 225.02 B: so you know it's um 

224.34 225.46 A: (( 'cause i mean )) 

226.20 228.04 B: (( yeah go ahead )) 

226.91 232.23 A: it makes sense i mean you gotta keep it open 'cause that way that way the pilots can go to the bathroom and stuff like that 

231.99 234.18 B: yeah 

232.94 236.18 A: if you lock 'em in there they're could be worse [laughter] 

234.54 241.02 B: [laughter] yeah well travel like um a cart you know like uh security

245.30 248.15 B: you know i mean like a security guard thing 

247.56 249.24 A: mhm 

249.70 254.49 B: (( and uh what do you think of the of the way the airport um i mean the )) 

255.29 259.53 B: s- si- six hours or almost all day wait

314.21 316.09 A: yeah yes 

317.08 320.99 B: (( [noise] [lipsmack] 'cause if you carry like a medal or something for the um ))

323.10 324.81 A: well sometimes it does but 

325.54 329.73 A: like i always say it's better better to be safe better to be on the safe side
