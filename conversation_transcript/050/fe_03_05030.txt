68.60 72.77 B: [noise] what does that consist of like what what do you mean is it u- underground it's like a bunker 

71.98 84.05 A: yeah yeah it's it's you know how like back in the old days they had uh had the cellars the in ground cellars that you know they'd if there was a tornado coming all the whole family would go run to that thing 

83.45 84.45 B: sure 

84.25 94.23 A: well it's it's something like that only it's it's built into my basement you know i've got the basement dug for the house and and then a- and of course it's concrete and then 

94.22 101.51 A: dug another little tunnel with uh basically a cave and it's got an exterior exit several hundred yards from the house 

101.53 105.19 A: and it's all concrete it's like a concrete bunker per se 

104.73 108.72 B: far out and did you d- you did that specifically after nine eleven 

109.52 112.22 A: well yeah 'cause i built my house after that 

111.58 113.35 B: okay gotcha cool 

112.64 115.77 A: b- but uh but that was one of the considerations 

115.53 117.09 B: (( yeah )) 

115.99 122.81 A: i was like well you know if if something should happen to the house and we're down there you know we need an alternate escape route and 

122.16 124.01 B: right right totally 

122.91 127.00 A: and that'll that'll provide good protection down there 

125.76 127.43 B: yeah 

127.14 129.53 A: [lipsmack] uh it's got a l- a little generator 

129.87 133.01 A: and um of course all the foodstuffs 

132.93 134.93 B: right 

133.87 141.63 A: and uh so that's that's pretty good that's that's here at on the home front um and of course an an arsenal of weapons 

141.41 145.39 B: yeah [laughter] 

142.66 148.40 A: but [laughter] most that's that's mostly for for hunting and stuff [laughter] and to keep the kids out of it 

146.84 149.56 B: yeah that's personal pleasure kinda stuff 

148.85 150.38 A: sure sure 

149.79 153.21 B: yeah and now did you did you have to go overseas

153.16 154.61 A: [lipsmack] oh yeah i've been there 

154.49 161.27 B: but just recently for the war and stuff like that were you just over there and back far out and how long you been back 

157.51 159.03 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] sure )) 

161.48 163.35 A: [noise] about a month and a half 

163.18 165.49 B: gotcha what do you what do you do in the navy 

165.16 166.89 A: yeah i'm i ride submarines 

166.78 170.87 B: oh wow amazing i never met anybody who's who's a sub guy 

167.81 168.67 A: [laughter] 

169.99 172.97 A: [noise] [laughter] yeah so um 

173.07 176.38 A: [lipsmack] so it's it's uh it's an interesting lifestyle 

176.29 177.88 B: yeah i'll bet 

176.47 177.52 A: (( to say the least )) 

177.85 183.70 A: and then you know professionally with the navy of course we've 

183.84 191.37 A: we've increased the number of watches that that we man up and gone through just oodles and scads of training 

191.19 193.43 B: we- yeah i'll bet 

191.68 195.56 A: a- awaren- anti terrorism training and um 

195.64 196.65 A: uh 

196.90 199.80 A: urban assault tactics and that sort of thing 

199.43 206.34 B: yeah are you now are you fulltime navy or a reservist okay got it and that 

202.30 203.73 A: (( i'm fulltime )) 

204.13 206.93 A: i'm full i'm just i'm just here on leave right now [mn] 

206.67 211.96 B: got you that's what i was going to say how could be if you're if you're a sub where are stationed 

210.77 212.45 A: (( uh in )) 

212.70 214.86 A: uh groton connecticut 

214.34 226.63 B: connecticut cool so you're out on the coast somewhere obviously i figured missouri's quite a ways from the ocean if you're going to be on a submarine unless they're going to go up the mississippi or the missouri river [laughter] 

216.11 217.73 A: yeah oh yeah [laughter] 

224.43 228.47 A: [laughter] that's right that's right so what about you what kind of changes have you made 

227.89 238.56 B: well very few on i mean [sigh] very few if any i'm trying to think um i i yeah i rent an apartment and all that stuff so i certainly haven't made any shelters and uh 

237.24 238.06 A: mhm 

238.53 250.70 B: i d- i don't i wouldn't say at all they i increased my foodstuffs and that kind of thing around the house right after nine eleven i lived in san francisco so i was a little wary of crossing the uh 

243.96 244.76 A: (( mhm )) 

250.23 251.34 A: the bridge 

251.09 260.03 B: the golden gate bridge yeah but um you know it's all like [lipsmack] i really haven't made many changes whatsoever in terms of my lifestyle nor have i 

252.07 253.52 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

259.96 267.17 B: i mean i wouldn't uh i haven't gone travelling much lately but i certainly wouldn't go travel in the middle east right now for pleasure 

266.84 267.66 A: uh-huh 

267.01 275.34 B: i mean i i would cross that off the list but i would have probably you know i probably never would've gone to iran or something like that but i might have gone like 

268.84 270.01 A: right 

275.11 278.57 B: sightseeing in turkey someday if it had been 

277.96 278.79 A: uh-huh 

278.43 282.81 B: prior to nine eleven but now i would definitely not do that for the next 

282.82 296.17 B: you know couple of years more than likely but that's not the you know it's not like that has even come up as an option so it's hard to say that i made that i'd i'm not doing that as a change but it's kinda crossed that whole area of the world off for me right now and uh 

283.79 284.68 A: yeah 

288.13 288.92 A: uh-huh 

294.45 295.38 A: (( [noise] right )) 

295.71 297.19 A: so what is it that you do 

297.22 298.36 B: i'm a writer 

298.15 299.62 A: a writer okay 

299.29 310.97 B: primarily for the m- in the music industry and i do uh although i do writer and p._r. really public relations too and oddly enough i was doing a like a public relations project today towards 

301.44 302.23 A: uh-huh 

306.25 307.05 A: (( sure [laughter] )) 

310.82 316.60 B: military magazines so i was like on the phone with all hands magazine and stuff like that today 

314.97 315.80 A: uh-huh 

316.01 317.32 A: right right 

316.94 318.37 B: um 'cause one of the 

318.16 325.41 B: companies that the firm i work for represents is hardigg industries and they make the cases 

322.43 323.18 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

325.19 333.91 B: fli- and they make flight cases and really heavy duty gear cases and one of their cases is used to transport the engines for the predator drone 

333.70 334.67 A: oh nice 

333.98 341.44 B: to the frontlines of the war on terrorism so i was making a lot calls regarding that today um just kind of coincidentally 

339.31 340.05 A: (( [noise] ah )) 

341.81 345.20 B: so uh but that's basically what i do i work out of my house 

342.02 342.95 A: [laughter] interesting 

345.19 345.95 A: so 

345.25 346.63 B: and uh 

346.80 349.17 A: we- well let me ask you this do you 

347.95 349.87 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

349.43 352.82 A: [noise] i mean has your awareness 

353.01 356.39 A: or um yeah i guess it's awareness is the right word 

356.81 364.62 A: for your surroundings 'cause you know living in l._a. that that i think would be one of the next targets that they w- that they might hit [noise] 

362.81 367.34 B: yeah you wo- you yeah you would assume so you know i mean i suppose it has 

367.31 368.85 B: you know it's certainly 

368.73 378.75 B: it has and i try and temper it too i have to say you know i don't want to think like every time i'm walking around on the streets like i should keep an eye out for somebody who looks like they're middle eastern you know what i mean 

377.54 378.35 A: uh-huh 

378.39 379.19 A: right 

378.58 387.33 B: i wanna be like the same guy i was beforehand but it certainly has i mean if it was if there was something suspicious i mean it would definitely bring the hairs up on the back of my neck 

386.97 388.11 A: yeah 

387.44 397.28 B: sooner than it would have beforehand but i try to keep pretty open mind about it [lipsmack] and i mean i do think you know things are gonna happen there's no two ways about it but i 

389.45 390.31 A: uh-huh 

391.93 393.79 A: mhm i think you have to [noise] mhm [noise] 

397.32 399.78 B: just feel like it's so random 

399.79 402.29 B: and so hard to figure out where it's going to go down 

402.30 403.08 B: if it's going to go 

403.09 412.76 B: down how big the scale is gonna be what it's going to involve that if i spent too much time worrying about it and you know just listening and like harping on 

411.02 412.38 A: exactly [noise] 

412.76 424.92 B: you know 'cause the media will jump all over anything because people are curious and they want to hear about but if i spent my whole life worrying about it you know that's it's just going to consume me so i'd rather just kinda you know it's gonna happen somewhere someday but 

415.85 417.00 A: (( exactly yeah )) 

420.47 422.39 A: [noise] [noise] that's exactly right [noise] 

424.95 434.62 B: it's it's a new thing for us americans 'cause a lot of countries this is the way you know it's been like this for a lot of co- lot of years in a lot of different countries nothing of that magnitude or 

434.07 435.28 A: (( mhm right you know nothing that )) 

436.72 438.41 B: gone down but they're 

438.85 451.16 B: you know even in england they worry about the occasional bomb going off and that kind of thing 'cause of the i._r._a. so it's it's uh it's something that i think about but i it doesn't cross my mind that often i would say 

450.46 458.30 A: terrible has [noise] right [laughter] you know i think that that um you're absolutely right in your views on that you you can't worry about it 'cause 

456.65 458.25 B: (( mhm )) 

458.34 464.52 A: hell your chances of getting hit by a bus are are about the same as as getting being involved in with a terrorist attack 

463.54 478.19 B: [noise] exactly there's so many things i think on a day to day basis that are far greater more present danger than the possibility of something like that happening but what what is so scary about that is that it's just so random 

464.98 467.41 A: so no sense living in fear 

473.51 474.97 A: yeah you're right mhm 

477.99 480.73 B: and it's just it happens to such innocent people 

480.84 488.41 B: that it frightens you and then it also makes you so angry 'cause it's so hard to do something directly to the people who did to you 

487.96 488.89 A: (( [lipsmack] yes )) 

488.59 495.07 B: you know you can make any argument you want but it's just like it's really to find the g- exact guy who did it so [laughter] it's like 

493.86 494.62 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

494.90 503.74 B: that's why i think it's you know it's such a big thing on people's minds that because of those factors and because of i mean it was just horrendous well it happened so [sigh] 

498.16 499.44 A: mhm 

502.83 504.37 A: absolutely right 

504.64 507.30 B: yeah it's tough i mean it's uh 

505.92 506.97 A: (( [sigh] [laughter] )) 

507.86 509.07 B: [lipsmack] i d- but i 

509.08 511.60 A: s- so do you keep oh go ahead [noise] 

509.41 510.44 B: i'd say 

511.03 514.02 B: uh uh some of the changes i've made i think some of the you know just 

513.91 516.60 B: more of the changes that i've made have to do with the 

516.55 532.72 B: fact that the economy has slowed down a lot since then it was already slowing down when that happened it was hurting but you know work uh there's a little less work out there than there used to be so i think those are the majority that majority of changes that have hit my life are financial and they haven't been severe by any means you know i'm still able to handle business but uh 

521.00 521.80 A: mhm 

530.46 531.23 A: mhm 

532.66 546.03 B: it's that's where most of the impact comes not so much the you know what else is i was a- i was also on the opposite side of the country from where that happened i didn't grow in new york or washington i didn't know many people there and those that i did were all safe and stuff so it was 

545.28 549.22 A: you felt kind of kind of removed from it and and 

547.83 548.38 B: (( [noise] )) 

548.47 559.88 B: yeah i mean i you know it hurt me as an american i mean there's no you know what i mean everybody was a new yorker for a week in september of two thousand one you know what i mean but 

554.73 555.79 A: (( yeah mhm [noise] )) 

559.78 572.24 B: [lipsmack] um yeah i did it wasn't like my high school friends were trapped in there or had direct first hand i was a- at least one person removed from everybody i sort of knew or knew of that had a direct contact with it 

569.76 570.85 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

572.03 580.73 B: but then i was just in new york like uh visiting my brother who's moved there since to manhattan and we were i was visiting him recently and he uh 

576.32 577.49 A: mhm 

580.95 588.55 B: you know it's it's just far more it w- this was right before we went into iraq i mean like the week before the ultimatum and that kind of stuff and it was 

586.24 587.01 A: uh-huh 

588.78 590.23 B: a lot more 

590.52 595.25 B: present on the minds of new yorkers than it was on the minds of californians 

594.59 595.77 A: oh i'm sure 

595.46 599.89 B: 'cause you know that's first of all the biggest target in the world and it happened there you know it 

598.36 599.24 A: yeah
