367.52 379.34 A: thank you no i've just been uh just been working away here [sigh] so this is interesting the um [lipsmack] the uh the survey or the study that we're par- participating in 

379.81 385.01 A: that they're getting people from all over the country to uh to respond to their 

385.67 389.05 A: i guess to their ad or how did you find out about this

398.61 400.03 B: (( and uh [mn] )) 

400.20 406.74 B: he keeps calling some of my relatives you know and make a quick ten or whatever it is well [sigh] 

406.71 415.58 B: i made one but it took me three weeks to make it [laughter] so i don't know my son keep on telling me you know you might win thousand dollars you know 

415.35 416.31 A: uh-huh 

415.64 430.26 B: so i keep thinking about the thousand dollars instead of the ten bucks [laughter] so i figure well you know i couldn't get i mean i was on the phone for over an hour i couldn't get through i guess they couldn't get somebody to talk to me 

417.87 421.20 A: [laughter] 

429.82 430.92 A: oh 

430.32 431.46 B: and uh 

431.91 435.71 B: the music was on for a long time [noise] at least eight minutes 

435.92 437.41 B: and then uh 

437.47 444.95 B: someone said you know give me the pin number i gave the pin number and then i'm waiting and waiting for another ten minutes so i went and called my son i said 

444.97 452.18 B: there's something wrong somewhere i said you know maybe you're more luckier than i am so he called the number all over again 

452.71 457.34 B: and i got you so [laughter] so i guess i was pretty fortunate 

456.93 460.11 A: [noise] [noise] all right well it's good that it worked that way 

459.51 461.22 B: (( but uh )) 

461.25 472.68 B: now he called my sister my sister said nah you can't make ten dollars so quick in ten minutes [laughter] and uh my son said yeah so anyhow he ended up making five calls 

472.62 480.16 B: and then he called this other number if you have a problem one eight hundred three eight zero seven three six six 

480.20 484.40 B: and uh the lady there in charge told him 

484.58 495.08 B: no he's not gonna get paid for the other [laughter] for the other two calls you can only make three well like i say this is only my second one is this your first one 

493.25 494.20 A: i see 

494.65 496.37 A: this is my first 

495.84 499.33 B: yeah well do y- did you know you're allowed to make three 

499.02 499.97 A: yes 

499.68 501.47 B: yeah you know that well 

500.96 501.71 A: (( yes )) 

501.35 513.16 B: anyhow he tried to get my nephew to do this too you know and i don't know whether he did or not because all my relatives live r- around virginia i know all where mi- military places are because 

505.63 506.47 A: (( uh-huh )) 

513.03 523.23 B: his father was in the military and his grandfather was in the military my father was in the milta- i mean we're from military families you know what i mean and so 

521.89 523.11 A: right 

523.79 535.79 B: i don't think that the boys the males they're not as afraid as the women are anyhow you know they'll probably call any kid of number [laughter] as long as they can make some [laughter] [sigh] so i mean um 

533.16 534.29 A: sure 

536.41 542.22 B: it is something i mean you know where can you go and make ten dollars you know in ten minutes 

541.84 544.88 A: [lipsmack] that's right that's right 

544.81 553.01 B: very few places i mean you know usually if you go out to work it's only what minimum wage six and a quarter or six fifty [laughter] whatever it is 

552.89 553.92 A: that's right 

553.22 562.91 B: so i really don't think that my son's gonna get paid for the other two but he's say- keeps on saying mom you're always lucky so i went to the [sigh] v._f._w. for quite 

562.75 570.16 B: some time and i guess about nine years but the first few weeks that i went there [sigh] they had different things that were you know 

570.28 570.87 B: (( [sigh] )) 

570.91 581.77 B: chancing on this and that so i won three times so he thinks then probably i can win this thousand do- [laughter] [laughter] 

576.62 579.35 A: [laughter] well i hope you do 

580.32 582.40 A: i hope you do absolutely 

581.82 592.04 B: i mean it's just like you know um we just got a letter from the oh uh from a chrysler company you know where i bought my car maybe about six years ago 

591.67 592.55 A: right 

592.00 599.95 B: and they they put a a key with this letter and they had it you know glued on and said you know
