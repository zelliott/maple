21.04 21.84 A: so 

21.88 23.08 A: go ahead 

22.50 32.17 B: go ahe- well i guess we're talking about uh airport security whether it's gonna reduce the risk of terrorist attacks [laughter] 

26.18 27.13 A: yes 

31.97 34.72 A: what are your thoughts are you a big flyer or 

34.28 41.46 B: well i have done a lot of flying in the past and i have a tr- international trip coming up 

41.62 42.58 A: okay 

42.21 43.24 B: so 

43.80 49.25 B: yeah they've gotten a little out there [laughter] on on everything 

47.23 48.02 A: (( [laughter] )) 

49.60 55.34 B: i had a s- i had a hand scissors just a little you know little scissors from trimming hair 

55.19 56.31 A: right 

55.74 62.84 B: on a carry in a carry on bag and i couldn't even get out of rapid city south dakota with that they took it away from me [laughter] 

61.05 61.99 A: (( oh so )) 

63.31 64.04 B: they 

63.36 66.33 A: that's kind of uh interesting [laughter] 

64.96 72.66 B: yeah yeah i thought it was kinda bizarre [laughter] it's not like a uzi or anything [laughter] 

71.60 75.25 A: oh seriously uh i mean like i guess 

75.63 78.92 A: according to what they want uh the topic there i uh 

79.41 84.94 A: i mean the everything that happened on nine eleven would've been stopped by the security that i've seen ever since then 

85.02 85.89 B: yeah 

85.62 89.07 A: uh i mean obviously if you can't get in with the scissors i don't know if those guys would've 

89.34 93.00 A: checked and rechecked and probably strip searched [laughter] who 

92.49 93.55 B: yeah 

93.32 96.41 A: knows if they would've been allowed definitely uh 

97.63 98.51 A: (( i don't know )) 

98.65 100.52 B: [lipsmack] yeah it uh 

100.81 104.81 B: it i suppose it [mn] does do some good 

104.96 107.01 B: uh you know it's just it's very 

107.22 111.95 B: inconvenient and i guess i just have to live with that but 

112.66 126.38 A: yeah that's the kind of thing that i also found that people were trying to like uh even even very close to when it happened that people were kinda getting frustrated with the security measures even though it's you know supposed to be for for our safety 

126.22 127.15 B: right 

126.96 134.74 A: [noise] i mean it seems like [sigh] i thought they were gonna get more lax they really i i don't know i just did a trip recently to uh denver 

134.94 143.90 A: and uh they didn't [sigh] i mean they were pulling people out having them take off their shoes and uh i mean we stood the lines were still moving but [sigh] 

144.13 149.63 A: uh i was kind of impressed with how they were doing it but still i i don't know 

150.58 156.12 A: i i'm sure anyone who uh there are people who like know how those systems work and they could probably get through if they wanted to 

156.04 156.99 B: yeah 

157.36 160.63 B: yeah that's just it they'll figure that out next 

160.68 162.61 B: (( you know how to get by those )) 

162.55 164.96 A: so yeah exactly 

163.43 164.25 B: but 

164.37 165.11 B: but 

165.34 166.49 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah i unders- )) 

165.67 168.03 A: well i mean i guess it is better than just uh 

168.42 174.08 A: i mean do you remember seeing those videos those guys kinda like walked right in like there wasn't even a little bit of security 

173.75 176.71 B: yeah no i haven't is that correct 

176.74 186.79 A: oh okay uh i mean i i just saw they had like uh video camera stuff i didn't see much of it but they had like just some video camera shots of the guys as they walked through the guys who like piloted the plane 

186.65 187.48 B: (( uh )) 

187.56 197.42 A: i'm like i mean there was almost like uh you know when you go to like an amusement park and do you have those like turnbuckle like those those things that kinda count you as you go in i swear it looked like he just used one of those 

192.45 193.51 B: yeah 

194.94 195.98 B: right 

197.20 198.08 B: huh 

198.50 199.78 B: (( and that's how the )) 

198.60 199.92 A: but maybe they're maybe 

199.97 206.63 A: that was like all the security there was maybe they were trying to make it over dramatic and it wasn't like a security point but [laughter] it was still kinda 

204.77 206.14 B: yeah 

206.28 207.29 B: yeah 

207.37 216.11 B: 'cause even before nine eleven you did you used to get wandered every now and then and you know and you had to go through the metal detector they've 

216.14 218.04 B: you know they were doing that before 

216.16 217.50 A: (( [sigh] [lipsmack] right )) 

218.10 219.40 B: and so 

219.47 221.43 B: i don't you know i don't know 

221.74 222.42 B: i 

221.77 223.88 A: (( year befo- go ahead )) 

223.29 225.11 B: i i just think that 

225.44 227.01 B: [mn] i don't know why they 

227.06 228.87 B: why some of the 

229.11 238.26 B: foreigners have been let into our country in the first places is more of of the question you [laughter] know these guys were here you know 

235.72 237.28 A: oh right 

238.45 243.21 B: and why why aren't they checked out more thoroughly before they even let 'em in the country 

243.67 247.10 A: yeah that's a that's a very good [laughter] point 

246.56 256.88 B: yeah it just doesn't make sense to me and then to scrutinize obvious americans that are obviously nothing you know i mean even uh 

256.99 259.16 B: our one of our ex senators 

259.36 261.75 B: who joe foss was 

261.98 265.94 B: there was an article in our paper about that that he had a 

266.38 267.88 B: oh what was it a 

268.19 269.58 B: i think it was like a 

270.20 283.97 B: a can opener or a knife or something it wasn't it wasn't anything it was a a metal type of thing you know but they were you know they wanted to take that away from him and he goes you know gee that's out for this country and you know i'm p- 

274.01 275.27 A: right 

283.99 289.71 B: he's but he's a senator he now lives down in arizona and he flies back and forth to washington frequently i guess 

289.60 290.51 A: (( oh okay )) 

289.78 290.96 B: and uh 

291.53 294.61 B: and he just couldn't believe that you know [laughter] 

293.18 294.14 A: [noise] 

294.66 297.52 B: he thought it was way to tough you know 

297.97 304.10 B: [lipsmack] and i and i kinda agree with him on that fact why should you know why should we as americans be 

304.10 314.48 B: scrutinized so thoroughly when excuse me you guys let them in in the first place you know scrutinize the people who need to be you know not [laughter] not americans 

313.61 319.93 A: that's actually a that's a really good point that i guess no one really brings up i mean it it never really [laughter] the americans 

320.32 321.36 B: yeah 

321.21 330.33 A: anything that's right maybe this is like one of those things that you know the government does to try to make it look doing something but their nationality is just sort of a 

330.53 332.66 A: a futile effort i guess 

332.43 333.35 B: yeah 

333.56 334.90 B: (( you know just )) 

333.66 336.34 A: just kinda like going through the motions or something 

335.98 339.15 B: yeah it makes you wonder if does make you wonder 

339.19 348.22 B: but one one time on our trip back from california we went out of the burbank california airport and they have a 

344.60 345.40 A: uh-huh 

348.28 356.54 B: very large x. ray machine right there i think it's unite- we were on united and i think it may have been one of the first of that type of thing 

356.50 357.40 A: really 

356.67 363.45 B: and yeah and we had trouble before my boyfriend has this pair of boots 

363.33 368.75 B: that they're sort of like the cowboy boot or a harley davidson biker kind of boot you know 

368.32 369.83 A: right yeah 

368.62 374.87 B: and and so we thought well we're gonna get around this 'cause at leaving you know they made him take 'em off and 

374.64 385.32 B: and do all this stuff and and so leaving we thought well we're gonna get around this we'll pack 'em right [laughter] so we packed 'em in a in a big dry bag and 

385.33 395.55 B: it it flew it for some reason there was something in the material of the sole of the boot that is so similar to plastic explosives that it 

394.69 396.63 A: right oh my god 

395.58 400.47 B: yeah it set off the the ele- you know their computerized 

401.12 407.72 B: x. ray machine you know it just it just threw the whole monkey wrench into the whole thing and everybody behind us had to be 

407.84 414.68 B: individually gone through every bag you know they had to start doing that because we that messed up the computer x. ray machine 

414.80 423.68 B: so i don't know you know and h- who knows i mean that was totally innocent but if they can if their security can now 

423.54 431.59 B: detect such things you know i guess i'm glad for that you know 'cause it's the plastic explosive kind of a thing that's what's gonna 

429.82 430.93 A: yeah 

431.64 433.24 B: be a problem you know 

433.40 439.55 A: well i haven't seen one of those you know are those uh are those gonna be more widespread now i have ne- i've never seen one of those things 

433.52 434.78 B: but 

439.44 453.45 B: you know i don't know i think this was of was kind of a first with [mn] and united was the kind of first one to do it and why the burbank airport i don't know you would think that would be at l._a._x. but or you know or in new york city or something but but uh 

451.74 453.08 A: right 

453.54 463.57 B: because burbank's kind of a small airport really but uh it it kind of ma- yeah it was kind of surprising that it it was there a. and then 

463.64 468.83 B: that the secur- you know that it did detect something like that you know but 

469.36 470.90 B: and you would think that 

471.23 480.79 B: i don't know what material is in these boots but they're they're staying home from now that's the [laughter] that's the moral of that story [laughter] [laughter] they're never going on another flight [laughter] 

477.34 478.60 A: [laughter] 

479.61 481.01 A: right 

480.93 482.38 B: [laughter] uh 

482.59 483.53 B: but 

482.73 483.71 A: well 

483.62 485.95 B: (( but yeah it was pretty pretty amazing )) 

486.12 497.99 B: and now i hear they even fingerprint you coming back in you know if you're going in on an international flight i hear where you have to be fingerprinted as we come back in yeah as we're coming back into the country so 

493.68 494.64 A: (( really )) 

498.09 501.60 B: that's gonna be kinda bizarre [laughter] i don't know 

500.71 503.31 A: what fingerprinted and ided oh 

502.65 514.16 B: yeah yeah you know of course you gotta have your passport and and i._d.s and tickets and all of that but i that's what i heard here just recently that now you do have to be fingerprinted when you come back into the country 

504.21 505.10 A: (( my god )) 

507.15 508.14 A: maybe it is 

514.22 515.18 B: so 

514.24 522.30 A: maybe that's the way for the f._b._i. to get their database up to date 'cause like everyone don't they only have criminals' uh fingerprints on on some databases 

518.08 519.18 B: yeah 

522.38 524.10 B: (( i don't know )) 

523.10 526.59 A: or convicted criminals i should say [laughter] 

525.04 532.25 B: that that could be i don't know and that may be why they're doing it is to to check for something like that or international 

532.33 535.05 B: (( you know maybe interpol has something to do with it i don't know )) 

535.70 543.29 A: [noise] wow well that's not really good 'cause now they have more it's kinda like they can see what everyone's doing at all times 

535.73 536.81 B: (( i don't know )) 

542.91 552.22 B: yeah yep yep it is nineteen eighty four was quite a while ago [laughter] and big br- big brother is watching us [laughter] 

548.76 550.28 A: (( seriously that's )) 

551.36 559.29 A: the problem with i._d. cards and all this stuff and they'd tell 'em well wouldn't that make it secure yeah sure it'll make it secure but then it's like there's no privacy anymore 

559.03 560.80 B: right right 

560.36 567.09 A: instead of calling uh your family tell you where they're going you're calling the government say okay government i'll be here from tuesday 

565.32 566.58 B: yeah 

567.82 570.67 A: god that's kinda scary 

568.46 569.45 B: yeah 

570.06 576.59 B: it is it is and you know it's but that's uh that's the way we've been going i guess 

577.00 581.18 B: and i don't know what the solution is but it it really is 

581.22 587.90 B: aggravating because you know like i said in the first place like i don't know why they don't do better security checks on 

588.08 593.09 B: any you know obviously these countries afghanistan or you know wherever 

593.44 597.68 B: iraq all of 'em that are so they hate america so much 

598.30 599.89 B: that why let 'em in here in the first place
