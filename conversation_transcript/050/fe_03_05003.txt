4.61 6.15 A: nice to meet you carolyn 

5.59 6.81 B: nice to meet you 

7.33 9.58 B: i guess we're supposed to talk about exercising 

9.24 16.05 A: always a good thing to talk about because it doesn't involve actually doing it i guess [laughter] 

11.14 12.06 B: [laughter] 

13.25 13.86 B: (( yeah )) 

14.69 23.31 B: [laughter] i used to do a l- a lot of walking but i have not done it lately and i need to get back 

23.19 27.86 A: it's one of those things where you either do it consistently or 

26.69 27.79 B: uh-huh 

28.03 34.91 A: the minute you stop it just seems that you kn- [laughter] it's almost impossible to get back into it but 

34.00 35.16 B: i know 

35.30 39.73 A: i try to work out two three times a week 

39.33 40.28 B: uh-huh 

39.82 42.71 A: and very often 

42.80 51.43 A: weeks will go by where i do it two three times a week no problem and then i stop for a week and then i realize it's been a month and 

51.09 52.68 B: yeah [laughter] 

51.61 53.12 A: [laughter] 

53.35 54.66 B: i know 

55.32 56.19 A: and 

55.42 56.76 B: where do you live 

56.41 58.68 A: uh washington d._c. area 

57.54 60.33 B: washington d._c. well it's late there isn't it 

60.40 62.77 A: yeah it's about eleven thirty 

62.17 63.35 B: oh uh-huh 

63.90 64.73 A: i 

64.90 71.35 A: usually don't fall asleep much before midnight especially when i don't get any exercise that day [laughter] 

67.06 67.83 B: oh 

69.24 72.09 B: (( [laughter] )) 

71.82 72.83 A: where are you 

72.68 73.75 B: kansas 

73.47 74.47 A: wow 

74.01 76.65 B: [laughter] long ways away 

76.13 84.81 A: we could walk you know from d._c. to or to the midpoint i guess that would be good exercise [laughter] 

78.06 79.07 B: yeah 

81.22 86.02 B: that'd be good exercise that's for sure [laughter] 

85.31 88.31 A: i i don't know it's it's one of those things where 

88.90 97.10 A: you know i i really do try but [laughter] it's never easy to keep a really good routine 

95.51 96.86 B: i know 

97.06 103.01 B: well i'm i'm a compulsive type person and when i do exercise i do it pretty compulsively 

103.05 106.10 A: well i guess that's a good thing in this case you kn- [laughter] 

105.11 109.85 B: well it is but then when i quit then i just quit you know [laughter] 

110.46 111.56 B: so [sigh] 

111.85 118.22 B: i just have not gotten started again i just i've gained a lot of weight and then now it's hard to exercise 

117.46 121.04 A: [laughter] that's the another downside 

118.60 119.94 B: [laughter] it's 

120.67 123.14 B: kind of a catch twenty two you know 

123.64 124.69 B: [laughter] 

124.06 126.32 A: yeah you can't win but 

125.62 130.50 B: i know i know and i know i need to exercise i know i do 

130.70 142.46 A: well i i wonder if uh maybe the conversation can motivate both of us to do better [laughter] and you know maybe next week if we get reconnected again you know [laughter] 

135.24 137.76 B: well it might it might help 

140.63 144.25 B: yeah [laughter] it'll be on something else next week but then 

143.29 146.38 A: that's true but we we can compare notes anyway 

145.70 148.63 B: yeah have you ca- have you done this very many times 

148.03 149.64 A: this is my first time 

149.00 152.33 B: oh this is my second time and i um 

152.38 162.25 B: i had gotten called the other night at my first time and and then tonight the phone rang and my husband answered and he didn't know what it was and by the time he handed me the phone 

160.42 161.48 A: [laughter] 

162.25 170.21 B: it was this recording was almost over so i thought well i'd better call because [laughter] i don't want 'em to drop me so 

166.26 167.47 A: [laughter] 

169.74 172.41 A: i can imagine that it would confuse the heck out of him 

171.77 176.65 B: (( yeah yeah he said i don't know what in the world they were saying they do talk really fast )) 

176.08 180.66 A: now does he get a lot of exercise other than running to the phone to 

178.87 181.65 B: he uh he doesn't do [laughter] 

180.74 182.09 A: [laughter] 

181.80 187.75 B: he doesn't do any like just exercise but he does a lot of physical work 

188.00 196.78 B: you know um he's he's always on the go so he gets a lot of exercise that way [noise] but he doesn't really do any like any walking or anything or any 

196.84 198.46 B: working out or anything 

198.77 204.45 A: well you know [laughter] it's a good thing he's not having this conversation or else you know [laughter] 

204.20 206.54 B: (( [laughter] )) 

205.80 209.79 A: i shudder to think what might be [laughter] 

209.15 210.68 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

210.08 211.19 A: um 

211.37 224.58 A: no it it's unfortunate i've been a member of a gym which is not far from where i live uh i'm in arlington virginia which is just outside of d._c. and i've been here since about three years ago 

217.76 218.75 B: uh-huh 

221.02 221.95 B: uh-huh 

224.18 225.08 B: uh-huh 

224.63 231.70 A: and i've joined the gym and i've finally you know after some struggling got used to going to this gym and 

232.01 235.17 A: sort of got good at making myself go 

234.88 235.82 B: uh-huh 

235.19 239.75 A: and then they decided to tear down the gym for some huge 

239.95 254.34 A: renovation project and they're going to build a huge building on the spot and two years from now it'll reopen and they're putting a gym in the basement so i figured i could either wait two years or i guess i'll have to find a different gym 

248.87 249.73 B: oh 

254.16 255.25 B: yeah 

254.66 258.89 A: and you know it's just the uh 

259.72 263.43 A: the difficulty of convincing myself to go somewhere else is 

262.54 266.42 B: mhm and w- and you know we can always find an excuse can't we 

266.06 268.32 A: it's true uh [laughter] 

267.13 278.09 B: see i uh i used to live in a little bit larger town than i live in now and we had nice side walks and we had a track i could go to the track well after i married my husband um 

278.23 288.33 B: uh we live in a real real rural town it's just [laughter] there's practically nothing here and we don't have even paved streets just uh gravel or rock and 

286.24 290.43 A: [laughter] well that's got to be good exercise to walk on [laughter] 

288.56 289.29 B: [laughter] 

289.30 297.07 B: well i they i've always found that i twist my ankle or something on one of those rocks and then a lot of people have dogs running loose 

293.16 295.01 A: yeah that's no good 

297.40 298.81 A: [laughter] 

297.59 300.90 B: and i was chased by a dog a time or two and yeah 

299.74 304.46 A: well that's another way to get exercise i guess [laughter] 

301.31 305.13 B: (( [laughter] )) 

304.81 307.44 A: i don't know that that's what they had in mind but 

306.85 319.18 B: [laughter] so i could see now that's two excuse i use that i don't have any real real nice place to walk and and those loose dogs and now they have made an ordinance which 

319.10 323.38 B: they're supposed to keep their dogs tied up so there probably shouldn't be any dogs loose but 

323.24 328.89 A: maybe you can get them to pass an ordinance that the roads have to be paved so you can walk on them [laughter] 

326.79 331.88 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] right at least one paved street to walk on 

331.36 335.81 A: [laughter] d- do you live in a a small town in kansas 

331.92 333.60 B: [laughter] 

335.25 339.54 B: yes it's real small there's probably about two hundred people maybe 

339.17 344.82 A: so do you at least know the people on the uh the town council who could pass such a law for you 

343.14 354.54 B: yeah [laughter] but i don't think they have any money so [laughter] so i don't think we'll ever get any paved streets we live close to uh to salina which is a bigger town but um 

345.49 347.48 A: no [laughter] 

354.95 357.31 B: and you know if i really was 

357.60 362.59 B: doing what i ought to i could go into salina and walk or i could join the g- the y. or something 

362.93 365.65 A: yeah that would that would again be too easy you kn- [laughter] 

365.17 367.74 B: i know [sigh] i know 

368.03 373.83 A: or you can always walk around the you know the living room or something [laughter] 

371.20 372.36 B: yeah 

372.99 375.41 B: that's not too much fun and i 

374.40 381.49 A: no probably not and i i imagine everyone else would probably think you know [laughter] something was a little wrong [laughter] i don't 

375.56 376.97 B: and i don't really 

378.94 380.40 B: (( [laughter] s- )) 

380.79 382.82 B: right [laughter] 

382.98 387.07 B: i don't really have enough room in my house in my front room for a 

387.19 389.54 B: for i have a television for a treadmill 

389.19 390.82 A: mm [laughter] 

390.15 393.10 B: and [laughter] you know it's too boring to go 

393.45 397.49 B: down the basement or upstairs to work on a treadmill so 

397.23 398.44 A: that's true 

398.06 399.55 B: [laughter] 

399.03 402.14 A: you need to move the t._v. into the basement 

401.38 405.31 B: (( yeah [laughter] so you have to go down there and watch )) 

403.36 407.10 A: and then put the treadmill down there [laughter] 

406.38 410.06 B: [laughter] yeah i know 

408.91 415.65 A: well and not to mention that if you had the t._v. in the basement then you'd get the exercise of walking up and down the stairs when you wanted to watch 

413.95 414.98 B: right 

415.71 416.41 B: right 

416.14 418.81 A: so you don't even need the treadmill [laughter] 

418.02 421.76 B: yeah [laughter] just go down the steps [laughter] 

419.04 419.69 A: (( a- )) 

422.37 427.70 A: all these solutions which we would never have thought of if they hadn't given us this topic [laughter] 

427.36 428.34 B: right 

428.55 430.22 B: that's a pretty good topic 

429.95 431.70 A: i guess [laughter] 

431.04 432.41 B: yeah 

431.78 437.95 A: um [laughter] you know it's certainly easier to sit and talk about it than to actually do it 

437.33 441.34 B: yeah it's a good thing they didn't tell us to exercise while we were talking 

441.01 446.03 A: yeah i imagine we'd probably be out of breath and that would probably throw off the entire recording 

442.84 444.21 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

445.46 447.83 B: [laughter] probably [laughter] 

447.66 450.03 A: what was the first topic you had 

449.43 451.44 B: uh it was about divorce 

451.24 455.39 A: oh [laughter] so this is a little bit tamer i guess 

452.25 453.31 B: [laughter] 

454.61 456.26 B: yeah i guess 

456.43 466.14 B: it w- well they yeah they said something about divorce and they said has it changed your h- the divorce rate changed your outlook on marriage well i thought that was a little hard to 

466.07 467.47 A: [laughter] 

466.80 470.68 B: i i didn't really know how to answer that too much but 

470.99 481.32 B: and the lady that i talked to we we kinda kept getting off the subject and i kept saying we need to get back on the subject or they're not going to pay us for thi- [laughter] [laughter] 

474.52 475.54 A: [laughter] 

477.13 479.34 A: [laughter] 

480.28 484.78 A: well i think we've probably said about everything there is to say about exercise 

482.44 486.57 B: i think we probably did yeah i think we probably did too [laughter] 

486.41 487.84 A: i mean [laughter] 

488.46 496.64 A: sh- short of you know comparing you know what our favorite speed is on treadmills i don't [laughter] 

495.64 502.35 B: [laughter] i really never have walked on a treadmill to be i just usually i used like i said i used to walk on the track 

501.73 504.25 A: you haven't missed much [laughter] 

503.06 504.46 B: well no 

504.74 510.92 B: i always thought maybe if i had a treadmill hooked up to the t._v. and like 'cause i used to watch like to watch uh 

511.21 520.49 B: wheel of fortune every night and if i had to walk enough to get enough electricity to run the t._v. [laughter] i'd have to do it 

516.92 518.40 A: there's an idea 

518.97 525.93 A: [laughter] if you slow down you won't find out what the puzzle solution is [laughter] 

521.46 522.11 B: (( yeah )) 

523.34 533.50 B: [laughter] [laughter] or if you see you didn't walk for thirty minutes oh that you wouldn't have enough electricity to run it for thirty minutes so i could watch wheel of fortune 

533.38 539.16 A: yeah [laughter] i think that's a pretty good idea i'm surprised no one's invented that yet 

534.03 536.12 B: [laughter] 

536.72 537.61 B: yeah 

539.23 541.02 B: yeah they should shouldn't they 

541.00 546.68 A: it would be great with kids too you know get 'em moving while they watch mr rogers and 

542.77 544.01 B: yeah 

546.10 547.49 B: yeah 

547.82 550.17 A: or sesame street or uh 

549.29 551.42 B: now do you work in the government 

551.20 553.50 A: (( i don't i )) 

552.45 553.32 B: you don't 

553.70 559.76 A: i'm one of the few people in the d._c. area who doesn't work in government but i i work for a historian 

556.81 557.76 B: uh-huh 

559.49 560.64 B: oh uh-huh 

559.79 566.15 A: about forty miles west of d._c. uh working on a book on the civil rights movement 

562.80 563.73 B: uh-huh 

565.55 566.66 B: oh uh-huh 

566.17 578.35 A: and a- again you know with my last job i worked in d._c. so i you know walked to the subway every day and walked from the subway to my office and it was good exercise 

578.31 583.23 A: i got this job and it involves driving forty five miles each way 

580.86 581.56 B: (( [noise] )) 

582.83 583.92 B: oh 

583.55 584.95 A: and you know 

585.46 595.71 A: the commute itself isn't the problem but you know i drive from my driveway to my office driveway and any exercise that i used to get travelling to and from work is just gone 

596.35 599.95 A: i thought occasionally about the parking my car near
