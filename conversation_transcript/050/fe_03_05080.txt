0.54 1.70 A: hi 

1.91 3.07 B: hi 

2.17 4.18 A: my name's my name is david 

3.83 6.64 B: i'm denis where where you calling from david 

4.71 5.57 A: (( hi denis )) 

6.54 8.52 A: uh utah near 

7.60 10.33 B: oh okay british columbia canada 

9.76 13.68 A: oh okay i'm not too far from salt lake city but 

14.10 20.87 A: um well your airport security is probably a little different from ours we i'm thinking being a different country maybe 

20.92 26.94 B: um yeah it's still pretty though it's uh very challenging they actually pull everything out of your uh 

27.19 32.03 B: your baggage and look through it piece by piece which is kind of annoying 

31.27 33.45 A: yeah that sounds a lot more um 

33.76 37.08 A: secure [mn] in uh in salt lake city it's 

37.83 38.63 A: i know when 

38.64 43.20 A: when things first started getting tighter they wanted you to get to the airport like two hours early and 

43.21 55.99 A: and it really hasn't been like that um i don't think it was ever like that here it's not a huge airport and most of the time you know you just get there an hour early and the lines aren't long and um 

58.10 59.58 B: (( w- w- )) 

58.20 60.35 A: not not cause a problem 

59.67 63.74 B: how inconvenient is it to get there for two hours or is that not really necessary 

63.70 71.52 A: well i guess there's only one major airport in utah i mean there's others that are served by commuter airlines b- 

68.26 69.13 B: okay 

70.86 72.71 B: right 

71.77 76.94 A: um and so for us we're maybe forty five minutes away it's not really 

77.07 80.06 A: a problem to get there but 

80.13 83.49 A: you know to sit in the airport for an hour if you don't need to [sigh] 

83.28 85.82 B: yeah well that's the way i feel too 

85.75 99.03 A: is just you know in- inconvenient and um [laughter] but i haven't flown in the last few months maybe six months i don't normally fly a whole lot 

86.07 86.95 B: (( it's [mn] )) 

88.17 90.66 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

98.54 99.47 B: okay 

99.26 107.91 A: uh and so i'm not sure if there's any more changes that have come since they've federalized all the people and 

106.23 111.11 B: [sigh] g- do you feel safer because of all the stuff that's implemented 

111.39 116.07 A: um i'd feel safer if they ran it the way from what i've read the israelis do 

115.87 116.71 B: right 

116.41 121.47 A: they don't check all the grandmothers and you know they they do profiling 

121.54 122.52 B: okay 

121.95 129.79 A: and so there's certain people that you should look over a lot more carefully and then other people you don't need to as much 

129.58 130.49 B: okay 

129.97 137.13 A: and the you know united states is so the government and bureaucracy is so much 

137.19 139.52 A: you know anti discrimination 

139.33 141.18 B: mhm 

139.70 147.04 A: that it it works against itself as far as trying to make things secure i think because they're treating everyone 

147.07 152.11 A: equally suspiciously and that just isn't isn't realistic 

150.18 151.53 B: yeah 

152.01 157.76 B: do you think that the way they've got the security now it's gonna stop terrorism or slow it down or 

157.74 159.16 A: (( uh um )) 

159.05 160.14 B: in the air 

159.51 163.07 A: well it appear- appears to have slowed it down some 

162.19 163.90 B: yeah 

163.17 164.29 A: (( um )) 

164.96 166.89 A: you know they they've just 

167.47 168.70 A: done uh 

168.75 171.54 A: but but part of it can just be luck too 

171.30 173.16 B: mhm 

171.74 184.15 A: and you know i don't know that that [mn] they don't publicize the government i don't think really publicizes when they've stopped people um so it's hard to for me to to gauge this kinda 

181.15 182.37 B: right 

182.44 193.82 B: do you ever see i know that sometimes we watch n._b._c. dateline and uh the twenty twenty and they talk about they put operatives in there and with guns in have actually successfully got them on a plane 

193.55 194.66 A: mhm 

193.83 198.88 B: [mn] do you think that's that's a reality there or probably not yeah 

196.49 204.47 A: i do hm i i've read that people that just continually are looking at the x. rays of the luggage it's 

204.61 212.36 A: it's easy to to miss things it's hard to stay alert and constantly vigilant um 

210.80 212.63 B: yeah 

212.71 217.88 A: and and then you know it just went overboard with things like 

217.90 221.77 A: tweezers and nail clippers and um 

222.78 226.51 A: in my opinion you know i don't i think they've relaxed some of that a little bit 

224.77 229.49 B: well we we find that too we can't have that anything even remotely sharp 

229.52 230.40 A: mhm 

229.94 233.66 B: a a child's toy that's sharp too bad you know put it in your 

233.70 235.70 B: luggage that goes underneath the plane 

235.36 236.58 A: yeah 

235.99 237.72 B: you can't bring it in hand held 

237.57 251.31 A: but w- one of the things that that to me is a bigger concern than than maybe uh you know an actual weapon is so you can check bags and it i think it would be easy to check some kinds of explosives 

251.46 252.83 A: and uh 

252.99 260.99 A: you know remote control uh or a timer or something like that um when i have flown with a cellphone they 

257.70 259.48 B: mhm 

261.07 263.12 A: uh always have me turn it on 

263.20 266.76 A: to make s- you know to verify that it actually is a working phone 

266.41 267.56 B: right 

266.92 274.44 A: but i would think somebody could modify a cellphone that it would appear to be a working phone and yet you know be a remote control 

274.52 282.97 B: yeah i've always had the idea if if they're uh if they really want to do this and and terrorize things or take the plane over they're gonna do it anyway 

274.84 275.78 A: uh 

282.68 284.03 A: mhm 

283.39 285.43 B: and i don't know how you feel on that but 

285.02 289.01 A: well if if somebody's determined enough um 

287.95 289.66 B: yeah 

289.35 293.86 A: but but we can do a lot to still minimize 

293.39 294.29 B: (( uh-huh )) 

294.12 299.09 A: um and but i think a big part of that as i mentioned is is the profiling 

299.00 300.32 B: (( right [sigh] )) 

299.57 300.99 A: (( and you know )) 

302.80 308.41 A: it's it's not that you ignore certain people but [noise] but you have to allocate your resources 

305.52 306.48 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

307.76 313.80 B: we've heard this thing called h- iris scans or something to do with eye scans do you guys have that down there too huh 

312.82 320.05 A: um not in public areas i i've heard of some of that technology being available 

320.34 326.65 A: but i don't know if it's actually in use anywhere but would be in in on a corporate level for security 

326.80 327.78 A: (( um )) 

328.48 331.75 A: being able to you know for buildings and that kinda 

330.85 333.64 B: yeah yeah 

332.29 333.23 A: (( um )) 

333.38 343.33 A: a- and that's something else that i think they could implement would be um and and i don't know wha- i can't remember what countries have done and maybe it is israel but having a a 

344.77 349.91 A: oh like a v._i._p. pass for those that have have passed whatever checks 

350.07 357.30 A: and and background and inspections and that kinda thing and then they don't have to go through the you know all the inspections 

357.01 358.73 B: right 

357.33 361.65 A: um and that you know seems to work well 

361.85 365.38 A: for them and i can see for somebody that you know travels a lot on 

365.63 369.76 A: you know usually on business that you know it can get to be um 

371.08 374.16 A: inconvenient [laughter] if if you're 

374.89 378.41 A: always having to wait in line and um 

377.22 379.67 B: oh yeah yeah 

378.84 381.01 A: do you travel much on business mhm 

380.19 384.53 B: not a whole lot no uh we usually travel once or twice a year 

384.84 388.05 B: and we just noticed that lately it's been pretty tight 

388.69 399.04 A: well and and i guess it i don't know if it has varied with you know we have the orange different levels of security based on color where there you know any of that's been 

394.97 397.35 B: yeah yeah 

400.09 402.88 A: recent as far as last uh 

403.11 404.77 A: you know month has been 

404.37 406.18 B: mhm 

405.05 406.90 A: more or less uh 

407.21 410.96 A: uh heightened alert with what's been going on in iraq 

410.88 411.97 B: (( mm mm )) 

411.57 412.47 A: uh 

413.70 415.11 A: but i i've 

415.73 422.19 A: i i'm not a big worrier you know when i look at things i look at the big picture and so 

417.47 419.22 B: mhm 

422.19 432.43 A: it's still safer than driving our cars uh you know planes aren't being blown up every day there's i don't know how many tens of thousands of flights 

432.26 434.23 B: right 

432.82 438.61 A: and and the odds are just so small that uh 

439.16 441.27 A: (( you know it wouldn't bother me )) 

442.31 445.68 A: to go on an airplane even you know even if it had been 

443.72 445.00 B: right 

446.04 451.74 A: you know september you know fifteenth or whatever the first flights were after september eleventh 

451.41 453.19 B: right 

452.68 465.30 A: you know just the odds are it's not gonna cause a problem on your flight and i tend to just be kind of fatalistic and and optimistic in that uh you know i don't anticipate trouble and 

464.71 477.46 B: mhm well especially if they're broadcasting that all this stuff is being done i don't know how many terrorists would be saying well let's try to see if it's true or not they know it's there now something that i i it just crossed my mind is 

465.97 467.13 A: (( [noise] so )) 

472.95 474.14 A: right 

477.26 490.08 B: there's nothing to stop a terrorist from having a highly contagious disease to walk on like a suicide thing and just everybody on the plane catch it spread i mean there's what can we do to prevent that i don't know 

486.48 487.51 A: mhm 

491.20 492.12 A: well there's 

491.22 494.10 B: i have no idea what kinda disease that would have to be 

494.89 498.27 A: well yeah yeah and i don't know and the smallpox certainly 

497.67 499.61 B: yeah 

498.78 503.91 A: can be contagious i don't know about you know through the air so much but 

503.29 504.77 B: yeah 

504.39 510.03 A: uh but i guess somebody could carry some kind of anthrax on the plane and release it 

510.13 513.78 A: you know and everybody get a pretty strong dose of that before it 

512.97 524.12 B: yeah but you would think that they'd want to do something that would spread then to the genu- general population when that person c- gets off the plane not only does that person get sick but they spread it onto others 

518.51 519.28 A: oh 

523.46 524.55 A: mhm 

524.44 533.39 B: uh i'm thinking of sars it's more a big issue here in canada i think than in the u._s. but seeing our leading city has got a whole pile of cases of it but 

529.15 530.42 A: yeah from what i've 

532.82 534.80 A: and that's the kind of thing that i'm it 

534.84 537.69 A: wouldn't bother me traveling to toronto 

537.25 538.83 B: yeah 

538.00 538.96 A: uh 

539.52 542.62 A: because you know you look at how many millions of people 

542.34 544.28 B: well that's it 

543.08 552.46 A: and it's the same with with airport security it's just not and i think we need to be as vigilant as we can but for my personal risk is uh 

545.88 547.20 B: (( yeah )) 

552.48 557.67 A: is low and so i'm gonna do what i need to do and and keep living and 

556.97 563.69 B: yeah well and that's it we can either live in fear or we can just live in confidence and go on with life 

561.99 562.90 A: mhm 

563.89 566.41 A: and and i guess i choose the [sigh] 

565.79 567.88 B: yeah 

566.45 568.04 A: i choose the confidence 

568.00 569.55 B: w- yeah i agree with you 

571.70 574.25 B: it must be getting very close to the end here 

572.01 572.77 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

573.80 578.02 A: um yeah i timed it on my computer and i didn't look at the seconds but it's 

578.28 585.40 A: it's within a minute um [noise] talking for ten minutes on a subject sometimes is easier than other times 

579.70 580.65 B: (( oh okay )) 

584.60 588.07 B: well it is uh i don't know is this the first time you've done this or your se- 

587.17 589.07 A: uh second time 

588.40 590.17 B: what did you have first topic 

589.76 591.08 A: um 

591.16 596.66 A: baseball strikes and high salaries or no sports strikes and high salaries 

593.74 594.77 B: oh 

596.04 597.29 B: oh yes 

597.16 599.70 A: and that was a r- more challenging 

598.52 599.89 B: (( yeah yeah ))
