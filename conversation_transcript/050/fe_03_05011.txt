18.87 20.53 A: yes 

21.51 23.70 A: (( oh okay huh )) 

22.95 23.65 B: (( are you )) 

24.45 31.23 A: um i guess we're supposed to talk for eight minutes on uh september eleventh and what uh 

31.15 32.41 B: what changes 

31.60 33.35 A: differences have you 

33.41 35.62 A: um made in your life 

35.95 40.51 A: mine isn't too much different i guess uh how 'bout yourself 

40.05 51.00 B: no i you know in the beginning it changed it would be like i would contact my mom more often and um because she doesn't live close by me um 

52.41 60.08 B: and so i felt the need that i needed to you know keep in contact with my family you know as far as that goes in case something did happen but 

60.90 68.33 B: i guess now i guess whatever's going to happen is going to happen you know what i'm saying i mean i can't control it and 

68.61 72.14 A: yeah yeah um i guess uh 

73.10 79.29 A: it's really the same way with me uh well i'm a little more cautious about um 

80.29 86.00 A: you know just doing things in general if if there was another uh strike against us 

86.63 91.03 A: but uh actually um 

91.06 95.23 A: there there isn't a lot lot of difference uh in what i'm doing 

95.48 102.79 A: you know and that uh really like grocery shopping or contact anybody or um 

103.31 109.62 A: anything in in general except i'm a little wary of 

109.85 119.07 A: of something possibly happening again and i really don't think at least from al qaeda uh i d- i don't think they're 

118.88 125.52 A: capable of doing too much here apparently [noise] uh so i'm glad to 

121.76 122.62 B: right 

125.66 127.16 A: glad to um 

128.20 134.11 A: [lipsmack] realise that that [noise] but actually not uh not too much different for me at all 

130.27 131.51 B: yeah 

133.80 143.10 B: yeah i mean you know you still have to get up and go to work and you know in the beginning it was really scary because you didn't know you know if there was a control over the situation or not but 

143.07 149.59 B: i think they have better ideas and in fact you know i just left the country we just went to mexico um 

149.23 150.29 A: oh 

149.62 157.28 B: a couple of times this year and you know the security is stricter but you know i didn't feel like um 

158.04 170.29 B: you know afraid you know that type of thing so but i think maybe if i was to go to maybe another part of the country you know like europe of something you know i'd be a little more tense but 

159.66 161.22 A: oh okay 

170.12 172.41 A: oh i wonder what uh 

172.72 178.28 A: what happened what you i don't if you went by plane or you went drove or what what i 

176.81 178.13 B: no by plane 

178.37 185.79 A: wonder what happened what the difference was there because i haven't haven't gone anyplace by a plane for quite a while [noise] 

185.07 197.46 B: yeah i mean really as far as the security it's pretty much now that you have to leave your suitcase unlocked and they totally search it um they still do random people as far as picking um 

197.36 204.51 B: the securities will pick up like um any type of metal you know i mean the least little piece of metal on you 

204.62 209.00 B: um they will pick it up more so than in the past 

208.93 219.82 B: you know so i you know i feel better about that but i know that like i said on both ends they totally you know they go through your suitcase you know um there and in mexico so you know 

219.81 224.85 B: they're really they're really pretty strict about that type of stuff on before you're boarding any of the planes to make 

225.01 231.94 A: oh that's that's the only thing i can really see that's a big difference is you're if you're 

232.55 236.87 A: uh you're going somewhere on the airlines i think i was at a 

237.37 241.73 A: airport and i noticed that the you know you have to leave your 

242.14 247.67 A: suitcase open and they really search it they don't just look at it they just they look through everything you 

246.52 247.97 B: (( sure that there's no uh um forbidden )) 

248.49 249.63 A: (( know )) 

250.02 252.32 A: (( mhm )) 

253.06 254.51 B: (( items [noise] yeah )) 

253.42 261.05 A: so that that is that is different [noise] although it doesn't really directly affect me i guess 

260.17 270.68 B: yeah yeah it'd be well you know when you're boarding though i feel safer having them do that you know than just kinda like okay let's just put it through a scanner and not catch something 

270.61 274.99 A: oh yeah yeah what part of mexico did you go to anyway 

274.36 275.63 B: um cancun mhm 

275.72 281.72 A: oh okay okay that's in the southern part there so you 

281.77 284.17 A: uh they checked you when you 

284.44 285.72 B: when you when 

284.70 286.62 A: when you left the country and then 

286.29 298.52 B: uh yeah and then when you do arrive you do have to go through and they random still select people to open the suitcases and that but even when you are leaving mexico they totally make you open everything 

298.71 301.41 B: and they search everybody before you go 

298.93 299.88 A: oh 

301.67 304.37 A: oh they are quite a bit stricter then 

303.68 304.63 B: yeah 

305.09 307.09 A: i guess you have to go 

307.13 318.47 A: and kind of just in general i'm getting the idea you have to go um ahead of time more than what you did before the september eleventh 

315.81 316.90 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

319.23 323.13 B: yeah they're talking a good two hours at least you have to get to the airport 

322.27 325.49 A: so oh okay that's kind of what i guess uh 

323.54 324.68 B: you know if you are 

325.99 328.62 A: i'm hearing i think is a couple of hours 

328.76 332.74 A: uh beforehand so 

330.22 331.14 B: yeah 

332.38 337.94 B: but other than that i haven't really you know uh changed too much you know i don't 

338.15 345.86 B: you know really watch the news as often you know and especially with the war and everything being done and so 

346.52 347.28 A: (( huh )) 

346.82 355.73 B: like i said i kinda have to still get up and go to work and you know go to the grocery store you know what i'm saying you still have to do your everyday life thing 

352.91 354.52 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

356.43 367.07 A: huh you know the ordinary day to day life you know like uh i'm living and so forth it doesn't really seem to to affect it too much except it's kind of in the background or you 

367.49 368.76 A: um 

368.98 377.25 A: kinda have to realise you know that there there is kind of a problem and it could happen but uh no 

374.74 375.74 B: (( right [noise] [mn] )) 

378.13 380.69 A: it's not really daily affecting you 

381.81 387.25 A: there was some- somebody um here that was got a that was 

387.49 391.53 A: um let's see i think they were with the guards and they were 

391.99 394.88 A: you know they were initially when 

395.77 401.66 A: you know first after september eleventh first happened then they they called some of the mili- 

401.46 412.48 A: you know the military people the guard people and they actually had to go and uh help out at the airport i'm not sure exactly what they were doing but either uh looking at uh 

403.64 404.77 B: mhm 

412.93 415.59 A: bags or helping with passengers 

416.19 430.92 A: until they got people that were hired for the the security at the airport and i think they hired they've hired people here now and they're you know they're pretty much set as far as that they've been trained and hired and they're 

421.77 423.21 B: yeah 

431.30 433.85 A: it's kind of a routine thing 

433.40 440.69 B: [noise] yeah i think if you know maybe we lived in a bigger city or something you know you'd have a lot more changes but 

440.90 441.84 B: you know 

442.24 445.59 A: yeah and yet there was one other thing i noticed though there was 

442.32 443.76 B: it's little old michi- 

445.52 454.08 A: i think there last time i went to the airport there was a sheriff's deputy outside [sigh] and he was patrolling and he was looking at stuff real close uh 

453.36 454.30 B: mhm 

454.01 461.13 A: you know they never used to do that and they like drive by before but not on foot so 

458.28 467.73 B: yeah no they they still are there but you know in case something would get of hand but i don't think as much as they used to 

469.05 470.95 A: yeah 

471.06 473.20 A: so when is your next vacation 

473.39 481.50 B: probably not until well you know i get a couple in the summer as far as but as far as like leaving the country i'm not i'm not doing that 

479.87 481.00 A: oh 

481.24 482.58 A: (( oh okay )) 

481.79 487.05 B: probably just do like the cedar point thing or you know [laughter] 

485.44 489.17 A: oh you pr- [noise] you you probably won't fly for that then 

488.90 494.52 B: no no we'll just drive for that one or take a bus or something but probably driving 

490.96 492.78 A: (( yeah )) 

494.56 498.07 B: you know just go to like seaworld and that type of stuff 

498.34 499.96 B: seaworld at cedar point 

498.70 502.82 A: oh you would drive to that's in florida right 

501.66 510.86 B: no they're they're um they're uh uh excuse me um there's a seaworld but i don't if it's exactly called seaworld but there's one in um cleveland 

510.31 516.03 A: oh okay i'm i wasn't didn't realise that i thought that was in florida that would be 

514.53 516.93 B: yeah there there well there's one there too 

517.39 531.77 B: there's one there too but and i don't know if it is -actly exactly called seaworld there but there is another you know like a sea aquarium type thing in cleveland so probably do that maybe the zoo in cedar point and 

518.42 521.27 A: (( right )) 

527.14 528.72 A: (( mhm oh okay okay )) 

531.54 534.98 A: well actually september eleventh wouldn't affect that at all then 

534.25 536.54 B: no [laughter] i hope not 

535.97 536.89 A: (( no )) 

537.13 541.78 A: that's uh that's fairly close then t- to uh saginaw should be 

541.82 544.40 A: i think it's just on lake michigan there 

543.76 544.73 B: mhm 

545.49 549.52 B: yeah it takes maybe about mm [lipsmack] maybe about four hours to get there 

549.63 554.18 A: yeah well let me ask you this are you taking more trips closer to home or does it make any 

549.84 551.16 B: (( from where i'm at )) 

555.06 555.97 B: um 

557.88 569.17 B: yeah yeah well like i said we did go to to cancun but um a couple of years back my daughter and i went to london and i'd like to go back but 

558.61 561.75 A: (( difference )) 

569.94 572.23 B: i'm not so sure you know what i'm saying 

571.80 573.82 A: oh okay okay 

573.86 577.18 A: yeah that's that's kind of per [noise] perception with 

577.26 589.78 A: uh me also that [noise] you know although i'm not you know i'm not going to go to europe but it would seem to be like it's not quite as safe as as going someplace in the united states so 

589.50 594.42 B: [noise] right yeah i feel i feel safer and even like i said even though i know 

594.67 599.89 B: you know that they're checking everything there's still that like i'm not home feeling you know what i'm saying
