0.59 2.68 B: (( hello [cough] hello )) 

2.56 3.73 A: hi 

3.44 4.66 B: (( how you doing )) 

4.63 6.40 A: this is m- jay 

6.04 7.61 B: huh this is sesoda 

7.80 8.87 A: how are you 

8.43 9.94 B: [noise] doing good thank you 

9.71 13.08 A: what do you think about uh heightened security 

12.62 19.41 B: um i don't know i have mixed mixed feelings about it and at one end i do think it 

19.47 24.58 B: does help but at the other end i don't know if we're getting the right people to 

24.77 25.78 B: check 

26.55 29.40 A: that's a good point i didn't think of that 

28.35 29.57 B: [laughter] 

29.48 32.17 A: my thinking is yes it helps [lipsmack] 

32.67 35.40 A: and i think we're gonna need it from now on 

35.45 41.88 A: but i don't think the next w- attack is gonna be that way 

42.06 47.13 A: i think the s._u._o. is gonna have hijackers and you're always gonna have 

47.24 60.05 A: whatever but the the real people who pulled this last one are very smart very uh laid back take their time time is on their side there's no rush 

60.18 71.03 A: and i think the next time they do anything it is not gonna be the same way they did it last time i think [noise] 

71.46 72.46 B: (( [noise] [noise] hello )) 

71.53 74.09 A: well that's a that's a crazy recording 

73.52 75.46 B: okay [laughter] 

75.57 82.22 B: um yeah i think they're they're gonna definitely not do i mean it would be dumb of them to try to do the same thing over again 

81.86 83.24 A: right 

82.63 83.68 B: um 

84.03 90.91 B: but i don't know if i feel any safer [laughter] i don't know if i feel any safer flying i i i don't think 

86.21 87.26 A: what's that 

90.48 95.10 A: well i think you got a good point there that the people they hired um 

95.79 97.75 A: are not of the uh 

98.07 103.65 A: you know they're they're just like to me they remind me of the the greeters at walmart and all that 

103.11 106.30 B: [laughter] that's a good point [laughter] 

103.77 104.86 A: um 

105.67 107.84 A: yeah that they're just uh 

107.34 115.71 B: it just seems they hired so many people so fast that i'm not sure if they had enough time to do the background checks to make sure they're qualified 

115.86 122.87 A: yeah but i yeah right and i think they did hire 'em so fast 'cause they thought they had to have something right away 

116.38 117.77 B: to do the job 

122.43 124.38 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

123.37 133.81 A: now i don't know if they're going back back now and rescreening and and now that they have everybody in place and there is at least some sort of uh 

133.80 143.43 A: you know deterrent that they're gonna start going back and seeing well did we rush too hard and there was there some people we shouldn't [noise] 

144.11 145.19 B: okay 

145.12 147.83 A: so i i don't know what they're doing 

146.19 147.02 B: [laughter] 

147.62 149.59 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

148.88 153.30 A: but i i know what you're saying but my wife travels a lot for her job 

153.10 154.27 B: oh okay 

153.84 155.15 A: and uh 

155.83 159.52 A: you know she she's out in california at the moment and uh 

159.81 163.37 A: due back over the weekend but she doesn't uh 

163.60 169.22 A: you know she feels the same way as i do that you're always gon- you might have some cuckoo who 

169.14 182.75 A: thinks he's gonna hijack the plane and taken 'em to some other country but she feels somewhat safe that as far as crashing the plane into a building or something that people who think that way are thinking of doing it another way 

172.87 173.77 B: uh-huh 

182.88 184.14 B: i think so 

184.07 193.18 A: that they're they're gonna you know knock on wood that they're not but i think we're all in agreeance that they're gonna try and do something again someday 

193.65 199.90 A: and it might be you know through our mail system it might be through the water it might be whatever 

199.49 200.60 B: mhm 

200.36 203.86 A: you know but i don't think they're gonna try a jet again 

203.75 206.17 B: yeah i think they're very intelligent and um 

205.93 207.32 A: yeah 

206.78 209.93 B: you know they they took their time in planning this 

210.22 214.43 B: you know so i mean sure they're gonna take their time and try and do something else but 

214.53 217.69 B: i don't think it's gonna be necessarily through the airlines 

217.39 224.73 A: [noise] yeah my wife was telling me an interesting one that she thinks and this is just her thought that [mn] 

218.87 219.64 B: (( but [mn] )) 

225.07 229.95 A: when you go and buy and airline ticket and then 

228.05 228.96 B: uh-huh 

230.44 233.95 A: go and change it for another day 

233.69 234.60 B: uh-huh 

234.21 246.29 A: that sets off a red flag because she has had co workers who have done that and have been pulled aside afterwards and thoroughly searched 

246.28 250.53 A: and apparently that's what the hijackers did that day 

250.57 263.02 A: is that they had originally bought tickets and one way because you know there was no need to buy it coming back and then they changed the ticket to the actual day they decided to do it [lipsmack] 

257.01 258.90 B: [laughter] uh-huh 

263.33 267.52 A: so anybody who does that now i guess it's a pattern 

267.64 272.87 A: that they are watching to anybody who buys a ticket and then changes it 

267.77 268.57 B: (( mm )) 

272.87 282.91 A: and of course these co workers were pulled to the side were thoroughly searched their luggage and then their pockets and everything else and of course there was no problem and away they went 

282.53 283.48 B: uh-huh 

283.42 297.80 A: but she was with them and was trying to figure out why everybody didn't get pulled and it was just certain people [noise] and through talking and all that it ca- you know somebody said you know two of the people that got pulled aside said i changed my ticket 

298.18 299.47 B: oh 

298.20 301.57 A: and i don't know if that's in the computers and that 

301.60 309.59 A: uh you know sends a red flag and when that person actually comes through it comes up on the screen to check this person or whatever 

309.21 310.13 B: uh-huh 

309.75 321.44 A: and it's an interesting thought of you know we don't know they tell us and of course you see those cards there but you don't know they don't tell us exactly everything they're doing 

317.12 318.20 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

320.62 321.65 B: that's true 

321.61 322.64 A: (( uh you do- )) 

321.75 323.21 B: that's interesting 

322.88 326.81 A: you don't know what they're doing behind the scenes and everything else and 

326.23 326.85 B: (( hm )) 

326.59 330.39 A: i can understand why they don't tell us everything 

330.26 346.95 A: but i i think they're trying and you've gotta give 'em credit and i think it's and the also thing that is like everything else credit cards and everything else is somebody really wants to beat the system and studies it and plans it and takes their time there's probably a way to beat it 

330.30 331.26 B: yeah 

346.81 348.07 B: exactly 

347.79 351.77 A: and if they really wanna do it with the planes again 

352.05 360.86 A: you know do they get to a baggage guy or do they get to somebody or you know they get a they get to an even a screener 

360.72 368.39 A: and a year from now that screener's been in there and it looks like they've got a good job record so they're not watching 'em and that person lets people through 

368.64 369.88 A: you know so 

369.35 371.47 B: mm slip 'em some money and [noise] 

371.11 373.07 A: yeah so i mean i know 

373.75 381.92 A: they're trying to do the best they can but like i said if somebody really wants to manipulate it they probably could 

380.97 391.66 B: [noise] [noise] that's true i i think um they are trying but it um that's just a a a thought that i always have in the back of my mind are these the right people to do that um 

391.71 399.39 B: or should you know now in retrospect go back and rescreen them or maybe get better people 

399.41 405.95 A: [noise] right yeah i think you're right because uh you we've always been at the airport and seen some of 'em and you say oh my god 

405.61 407.05 B: [laughter] 

406.07 408.51 A: i wouldn't trust that guy to mow my lawn 

408.16 409.80 B: [laughter] 

408.84 413.68 A: but um these are the ones protecting you know the hundred people on the plane [noise] 

413.09 414.38 B: exactly 

413.96 419.27 A: yeah so uh yeah uh maybe they need to go back and readjust that or whatever 'cause 

419.87 432.64 A: they probably did need now that you think about it they needed to go out and hire thousands of people right away and they probably they probably didn't do that much checking they did a a random check but they probably 

426.25 427.29 B: [noise] because 

432.76 438.75 A: couldn't seriously check everybody in that amount of time they needed to get people there [noise] [noise] 

437.79 441.77 B: [sigh] yeah because it happened so fast and everything everybody moved so quickly 

442.05 446.58 B: you know dur- after september eleven that i'm not certain if they you know 

447.33 450.78 B: really took their time and and analyzing everything 

450.78 459.15 A: [mn] yeah they did they probably didn't but you know and then you have the the press are a big business and they don't have the time to 

459.14 469.07 A: take a week off and [noise] you know that everything's gotta keep moving and [noise] and that doesn't make it right but [noise] i can understand their concerns and [noise] 

464.11 465.01 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

469.23 479.07 A: you know i don't like everything else there's no easy answer and somebody's always gonna be upset and somebody's al- you're always gonna get somebody mad that they're inconvenienced or something 

472.12 473.09 B: (( no )) 

478.88 481.60 B: that's true that takes forever now 

479.80 480.88 A: (( and uh )) 

481.16 484.16 A: yeah everybody it is a go go go 

484.03 496.52 A: society now and [noise] nobody wants to wait and nobody wants to be held up and you don't wanna be behind the guy who's getting the questions asked and everything else and 

495.44 498.33 B: yeah you have to look at the airport like the dmv 

499.53 503.37 B: [noise] 'cause when you have to take your time when you go there [sigh] [sigh] 

499.83 500.93 A: like how 

503.14 511.14 A: oh yeah gee yes that's it now you know you used to say get there an hour hour and a half before now it's two and a half hours three hours before 

510.53 517.52 B: yeah or i just like i'm from california so instead of taking l._a._x. i'll take burbank which is less crowded 

517.36 518.34 A: (( [mn] uh-huh )) 

518.06 521.93 B: you know it takes a little bit less time to travel but 

522.29 523.11 B: (( you know )) 

522.38 530.95 A: right but they they must still have their restrictions and everything else right yeah you just just less 

523.38 524.40 B: if you 

527.39 528.47 B: right 

529.00 529.86 B: yeah 

531.01 535.31 A: terminals and all that yeah it's uh 

532.48 533.87 B: mhm 

535.46 540.59 A: it's a it's a the question i probably could go on for hours or days and 

539.93 545.29 B: [noise] [laughter] yeah i don't think there's one i mean we're not gonna find an answer any time soon 

541.11 541.95 A: and 

545.30 549.58 A: right but i will give like i said i will give 'em credit because 

549.79 558.59 A: they obviously are doing more than they did before and uh you gotta give 'em credit for that maybe not exactly how 

553.02 554.34 B: (( mm yeah )) 

558.66 560.59 A: we think it should go or 

560.75 564.52 A: but you gotta figure there are some smart people making the decisions too 

564.48 565.59 B: that's true 

565.30 566.61 A: and uh 

566.90 569.98 A: like i said we don't know everything they're doing they 

569.88 575.45 A: can't tell us everything but i'd be surprised if there wasn't a couple of 

575.41 588.32 A: behind the signs s- you know behind the scene things that we don't know about and if they ever caught somebody then they would tell us this is how we caught 'em [sigh] and we'd be surprised and say oh my god i didn't know you were even doing that kind of stuff 

587.75 588.91 B: yeah 

588.27 595.99 A: and then we'd give 'em all a round of applause but if anybody ever gets through again then there's gonna be big problems 

590.57 591.90 B: [laughter] 

595.67 597.02 B: i think so 

596.77 599.63 A: yeah i mean if somebody got through again
