67.58 69.53 A: it it did mention 

69.88 80.59 A: high salaries and um i i guess i mean it's you know if they deserve it it's all based on what people are willing to pay and the owners 

80.61 83.34 A: but i don't see how they can afford to pay all this 

84.10 99.03 A: money you know a hundred million dollars over ten years and you know even though they have ways to get annuities and and things to to finance it with what some of these payrolls cost just 

99.78 104.92 B: can you imagine i mean think about it think if you were one of the sports guys

122.28 123.61 A: [laughter] 

122.75 128.50 B: they like don't get anything and then somebody who can play a sport gets all this money

132.58 133.65 B: oh 

141.74 146.35 A: if if you broke down even with their practice time and everything um 

142.14 143.07 B: (( wow )) 

146.48 152.91 B: well i mean you know i don't take away from them that they are able to do something that the average person cannot do 

153.59 156.47 B: but it's still just a sport 

156.79 160.46 A: that yeah i i i agree it's just hard to 

157.46 158.90 B: [laughter] 

160.04 162.35 B: it's still just entertainment you know 

161.35 162.33 A: [laughter] 

162.37 167.40 A: well and i don't you know and that that's to to fund a lot of that the uh 

167.88 174.74 A: uh ticket prices have gone up i i don't go to see live professional sport normally but 

172.50 175.45 B: yeah me neither it's just so expensive mhm 

175.25 176.36 A: um 

176.56 179.65 A: the you know tickets are 

179.91 192.16 A: well i live in utah the the utah jazz basketball team are i think are the highest lea- the highest seats away are the least expensive seats are twenty five dollars a ticket or something like that [noise] 

192.13 193.24 B: (( uh-huh )) 

192.35 193.31 A: uh 

193.79 196.71 B: well i'm in l._a. so we've got the lakers

199.29 200.37 A: and lived 

201.68 202.67 A: uh-huh 

202.78 203.92 B: (( and i )) 

204.34 211.82 B: m- i mean i've been to like a basketball game and you know baseball's not quite as bad 'cause you can go out into the 

213.06 214.84 B: (( bleachers or whatever you call them )) 

214.59 216.32 A: mhm yeah 

215.60 224.10 B: but you know by the time you know you pay for your ticket and you pay for parking and i mean it all does get sort of expensive if you're on a budget 

223.84 232.90 A: well that's that's definitely true and i think that's one reason they're so the ticket prices are so high is is to pay for the salaries but as long as people are willing to 

232.25 237.03 B: but somebody must pay it you don't pay it and i don't pay it 

234.63 235.80 A: to pay the 

236.32 237.82 A: [laughter] 

238.09 243.03 A: yeah there are fifty thousand people out there at dodgers stadium oftentimes 

244.00 245.08 A: (( um )) 

245.62 248.49 B: we probably i probably go maybe 

248.99 252.95 B: once every couple of years to the baseball game or something 

253.35 257.00 B: only because maybe a group of people are going or something 

256.25 257.11 A: uh-huh 

257.05 260.11 B: you know and you sort of want to go with the group of people 

260.07 261.98 A: well where we um 

262.13 264.76 A: near near us is a 

265.29 268.77 A: very minor league team i don't know if it's 

269.02 281.59 A: a rookie league or single a but um their ticket prices are pretty reasonable you can get in i think for five dollars a ticket but it's it's almost like one it's it's one step up from high school 

281.65 282.57 B: mhm 

281.74 285.43 A: you know or or it's like a a college team 

284.84 285.77 B: (( oh )) 

286.59 290.35 A: and so they're a lot lot less expensive but it's 

290.85 292.71 B: well you know somebody's paying it 

292.60 294.57 A: yeah 

293.97 297.37 B: because if they weren't paying it they wouldn't be able to command it 

297.53 300.72 A: and and they wouldn't uh they wouldn't be in business anymore 

300.42 301.39 B: right 

302.45 306.50 B: so it's probably it's not me i'm on a budget 

306.04 314.37 A: uh one thing about the strikes that then that's why from what i just read in the paper a lot of people don't have sympathy for them because when they're demanding 

313.88 315.87 B: or they strike for money you mean 

315.30 322.22 A: yes striking for money or working conditions it's it's hard to to g- to get much sympathy from 

322.29 330.20 A: i think most people uh when you you know when the minimum salaries are are three hundred five hundred thousand a year 

330.08 331.18 B: yeah 

330.48 338.89 A: and and if you're good or even if you're not good [laughter] you know there there aren't that many people that make the minimum [noise] 

338.24 339.88 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

339.18 344.16 A: um and and you know their working conditions are 

344.29 346.81 A: you know they fly on private planes and [laughter] 

347.58 355.16 B: well i mean we know that you know there there are a few of them a lot of them are not very good role models either 

354.86 357.52 A: now that's that is very true i 

355.72 356.63 B: i mean 

356.87 361.16 B: you know so i never really wanted to bring my children up to 

361.30 362.21 B: you know 

362.40 365.02 B: to idolize that type of thing 

364.71 368.64 A: [noise] yeah i have uh six daughters and one son

382.60 383.34 B: oh 

383.57 384.93 B: mhm 

384.17 396.96 A: and [mn] never brought them up thinking that that sports was important you know that is there were better things to do with your time than you know watching sports on t._v. and and they never 

395.55 396.56 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

397.28 398.37 A: (( uh )) 

398.90 408.04 A: really became any kind of fan or or even very interested you know they they'd heard of people like michael jordan but um 

406.54 407.62 B: right 

408.63 413.85 A: really are quite ignorant of that 'cause they don't watch much t._v. and we just 

414.05 417.84 A: talking about role models it wasn't something we wanted them 

415.38 416.38 B: (( yeah )) 

417.70 423.12 B: yeah and i have i have three and none of them are sports people 

418.90 420.23 A: emulating 

423.85 428.57 A: you know i just think there's so much better uses of your time as an adult 

428.54 429.90 B: yeah 

429.19 430.94 A: and so 

430.48 431.64 B: i agree 

431.16 436.69 A: i'm i'm not i'm not helping to support or contribute to the the high salaries 

436.91 439.11 B: but somebody must be 

437.10 438.32 A: even by 

438.64 443.70 A: somebody must be 'cause there's a lot of people who watch e._s._p._n. and and watch um 

444.13 451.57 A: i don't know if they have pay per view and you know i've seen packages advertised for uh you know watching sport 

451.23 453.98 B: oh do you mean like on commercial or something 

453.41 456.14 A: on um on cable t._v. 

455.55 456.59 B: uh-huh 

456.22 462.92 A: you buy so many games or packages of of tickets to watch on t._v. but 

462.95 469.52 B: you know i'm just i'm really glad that my husband's not one that is one of those people that watches sports all the time 

463.14 464.00 A: uh 

468.12 479.36 A: [noise] mhm um and my wife has said that's one reason one of the things she liked about me is that that i wasn't particularly interested in sports and as far as plopping down and watching 

476.49 477.44 B: yeah 

478.78 487.15 B: yeah 'cause these people i mean they go all out and they just i don't know i think they ignore their families but maybe i'm incorrect 

489.18 494.27 A: yeah so i haven't have you timed this at all i didn't look at my clock 

493.81 498.39 B: well i think that they come back on and probably we have like a couple more minutes 

499.69 500.86 A: well i'm 

500.27 504.85 B: so who's the highest paid athlete that you know michael jordan 

505.05 508.02 A: uh he is retired 

507.67 509.10 B: yeah okay 

508.83 510.01 A: um 

509.43 511.09 B: (( he was the highest paid huh )) 

510.63 518.97 A: i i you know i don't know um i know that hockey players for example don't get paid nearly what uh [noise]

519.48 527.77 A: what basketball players and and football players and baseball players get paid um 

522.38 523.41 B: shaq 

526.24 528.06 B: mhm 

527.81 531.69 A: so it it depends on the the sport 

532.63 533.45 B: well 

532.67 536.90 A: you know not even talking about you know women's foot- basketball or 

538.16 542.44 B: you know it must say something about this country that we're willing to 

543.07 546.46 B: pour or pay that much m- money for 

545.55 546.18 A: (( [noise] )) 

547.51 549.22 B: people who do sports
