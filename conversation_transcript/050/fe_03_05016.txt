17.71 19.04 A: well uh 

19.19 23.55 A: my wife and i are uh senior citizens so we don't do that much travelling 

23.46 27.52 A: uh before i retired i did a lot of travelling i'm sure i would have done 

27.35 40.54 A: had more changes then we really haven't changed our lifestyle uh we've travelled we've been on airplanes since [noise] uh uh just a tremendous amount of security but we really haven't changed the way that we function 

41.27 56.14 B: [noise] [noise] uh-huh well me and my wife um [noise] we haven't changed the way we function either but uh we were both very sad you know to know that a lot of people lost their lives and um 

54.03 55.30 A: oh certainly 

56.41 69.30 B: [noise] it was just drastic we'd never seen anything like that and then on t._v. they didn't let the people forget you know so it it was bad it was really bad and and i wonder sometime 

62.95 64.78 A: no right [noise] 

69.33 75.28 B: you know the pain and agony that the people must have felt in that plane minutes before they perished you know 

74.68 75.94 A: oh goodness 

76.15 77.54 B: yeah that was 

76.64 86.20 A: yeah unbelievable i thought that uh after that happened i thought that my children and my grandchildren 

78.15 79.89 B: yeah 

86.28 98.38 A: would never have the kind of life that we had i thought changes in the way the world functioned would be so much different and really they haven't changed much there's there's a lot more security 

93.54 94.69 B: b- that's true 

95.77 97.15 B: no it hasn't 

98.44 102.94 A: but um i i firmly believe there's going to be more terrorist attacks 

103.07 116.46 A: i'm surprised there hasn't been one yet uh i i give uh bush i don't know if you're a republican or not but i give president bush a lot of credit uh in putting the curtail and trying to end this thing 

115.86 117.31 B: (( [mn] [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

116.94 120.25 A: i think without him we would have a lot more trouble i really do

124.55 136.40 B: two i me and my wife also we have three kids and uh they're grown but except the fifteen year old you know but i worry because um

139.39 140.26 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

140.02 150.22 B: and uh the kids they go back you know periodically to visit family you know to know them and uh it just saddened me because i w- i w- i'm like you you know 

150.19 158.83 B: there's other things to come you know and uh you you think to yourself well god this has never happened in my era 

152.46 153.30 A: sure 

158.80 173.34 B: we're in a new era and [noise] i thought maybe what you would have to worry about with kids especially fifteen year olds if they get with the wrong bunch or gang bangers or drugs you know or alcohol and this is much bigger than that so 

166.48 167.79 A: yeah sure sure 

173.83 176.73 B: [noise] it's just sad it's really sad 

175.37 179.97 A: yeah we we had a few opportunities to go uh 

179.98 183.39 A: cross the cross the sea to the el- old country you know 

183.11 184.13 B: uh-huh 

183.50 189.14 A: uh we we decided we will not go [noise] we will not go to europe or

216.33 218.52 B: is that right 

217.40 218.84 A: but oh it is 

218.93 222.26 A: it's unbelievable the security when you go like to um

225.09 226.25 B: uh-huh 

232.99 237.85 A: whatever you're carrying they every every thing you're carrying is opened up and checked so

383.57 384.43 A: sure 

385.47 396.01 A: but all in all i guess the world has changed and i think everybody even though you think you might not change the way you do things i think everyone has changed a little bit because of it 

395.09 397.25 B: [noise] [noise] yeah i think so too 

397.03 397.77 A: (( sure ))

420.59 423.03 B: (( mhm )) 

421.50 425.46 A: and i don't think those people will ever get along i really don't 

425.77 438.54 A: i mean every the the last couple of presidents we've had have really tried to get peace out there and those people are just you know it's uh it's still the holy war out there and they've been fighting for two thousand years 

425.84 427.75 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

431.54 432.68 B: (( uh-huh ))

449.73 450.98 B: that's what i'm 

451.76 461.82 B: yeah that's bad [lipsmack] that's bad and i you know i feel that uh i hope there's something that we as americans and our government can do 

453.01 453.88 A: sure 

461.91 465.60 B: to improve their poverty you know to let 'em know that we're in 

465.81 468.11 B: we it's not as bad as they feel 

467.60 469.03 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

468.91 472.95 B: yeah because they you know they really need help they're hungry they're 

472.76 473.87 A: oh sure 

473.51 478.99 B: just a number of things and they feel like america's coming over there taking their stuff 

478.26 480.14 A: [noise] sure sure 

479.45 481.14 B: yeah 

480.47 489.48 A: i'm sure that's a lot to do with it but i i think that uh i think america's trying uh we're sure sending a lot of relief aid over there 

482.64 483.90 B: (( yeah i'm )) 

489.39 490.57 B: uh-huh 

489.96 496.61 A: you know we're trying to feed the people and i i think we will have to always continue to do that 

495.68 501.86 B: yeah well you know my opinion on that i feel like america's on its last leg 

501.98 503.10 A: oh well 

503.25 505.44 B: as far as peace i really do 

505.12 506.89 A: yeah 

507.06 510.54 A: yeah i think i agree with that i think we're going to 

507.09 508.79 B: i really really do 

510.59 515.00 A: have more problems we never had anything over here till september eleventh 

514.84 517.13 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

515.52 518.75 A: and i think that's just the start of it 

518.26 522.37 B: (( and then i was listening on the news the other day about the orange alert )) 

522.04 523.15 A: yeah 

522.55 524.60 B: and it made me wonder because 

524.76 529.62 B: since that incident that's all we have at our building 

530.32 531.69 B: you know um 

532.23 541.26 B: is if you know at first when when you come out your door we live in an apartment and when you come out your door you know um 

541.59 545.98 B: you they look at you like well what is their attitude going to be you know 

545.33 547.46 A: yeah that's right 

546.59 552.08 B: yeah but but i also i i seen on the news was kinda saying when it first happened that uh 

552.29 559.32 B: some people with the turbans on this he- head they said they were chased and beat down their street going to work 

556.59 557.40 A: sure 

558.76 562.22 A: i believe that i believe that 

559.82 561.65 B: (( yeah )) 

561.69 564.05 B: and it's bad to prejudge you know 

563.86 564.66 A: sure 

564.84 567.19 B: (( it's very bad )) 

565.25 570.79 A: but everyone just like they just type 'em as uh they're going to be a terrorist 

569.76 571.16 B: yeah that's true 

570.94 573.33 A: and it's not right to do that that's for sure 

572.96 575.47 B: no it's not right 

575.92 580.18 B: so i i just uh like i said all i do i 

580.66 586.69 B: i pray and you know not only that i hope and wish that things will get better 

585.20 586.96 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

587.60 599.89 B: [noise] things will [noise] yeah 'cause this this is not good for the kids at all especially you know th- mine they're young and they ask me a lot of questions about peace and why don't we have peace and i 

587.70 590.27 A: that's all you can do that's all you can do
