0.00 0.45 A: (( how )) 

0.07 1.88 B: hi this is paul 

2.96 4.63 A: (( you doing paul my name's ben )) 

5.90 10.19 B: okay so you wanna go or want me to go all 

10.49 12.48 A: go right ahead go right ahead 

11.98 22.87 B: right well i guess it's just talking about what security at the airports and if if's actually gonna going to do something to deter airport attacks or air attacks 

23.08 25.19 B: terrorist attacks um 

24.58 28.07 A: (( yeah yeah what what what are you feelings on that )) 

27.57 30.89 B: um i think that 

30.96 35.75 B: it's hard it's a hard one i think yeah it does deter it to some extent because 

35.72 49.64 B: it doesn't make it as easy as it was before um but that doesn't mean that it's not gonna ever happen again i think that would be a false sense of security um and whether or not that's the case i still have the feeling 

50.04 54.46 B: after it's happened once that that something like that could happen again 

54.72 61.61 B: then again i'm inclined to believe that uh [mn] that that terrorists uh would probably actually use 

61.92 73.22 B: something else i mean there are there are lots of things nobody was looking at airplanes and thinking wow they these are these are such a target for terrorists to use as as bombs right um 

73.44 76.65 B: no one was thinking that before nine eleven 

76.96 85.85 B: and there's probably a lot of other stuff that that could potentially be used for devastating terrorist attacks that we're not really paying much attention to so 

86.07 88.52 B: that's the part that worries me more mhm 

89.89 92.30 A: i i completely agree um 

93.22 94.82 A: the airport security 

95.44 99.78 A: does deter terrorism but you know the whole thing of it is that 

100.93 105.06 A: it it's kinda like uh in any kind of business you know when it's 

105.03 116.45 A: uh nobody thinks a certain accident is going to happen until it happens and then once it happens they put a procedure down for it and then it prevents it or tr- or or makes it more difficult 

117.10 122.03 A: by implementing airport security making it more stringent as is um 

122.25 130.55 A: yeah it deters the fact that it makes it a lot hard but just as you said there are many other ways of terrorism and of do- of of accomplishing 

130.23 131.15 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

130.90 139.67 A: um that kind of devastation and [noise] plain and simple i mean airport security is good and all and an- and it does give 

139.76 146.33 A: some kind of security but as it as as said when there is one way of doing things 

146.48 158.51 A: uh there are several other people finding different ways and different things to basically use and do so exactly i mean i i really believe that i think that uh [lipsmack] 

151.68 152.61 B: [noise] [noise] 

153.73 154.67 B: mhm 

158.69 166.66 A: um we're doing as much as we can especially in the airport security there's really nothing more that you can add to it or or there is but you know 

166.87 170.07 A: we won't know until something else happens 

169.86 183.76 B: yeah exactly now now what do you think about the airport security though do you think that it it in you know itself is sufficient do you think that anything else i don't wanna try to hijack this but i think that we both kinda see eye to eye 

183.91 191.72 A: right no um i live in a smaller town i live in indiana um and in our in our airports 

187.56 188.51 B: uh-huh 

193.19 200.03 A: you know the level of security right there is i mean it isn't as if we go 

195.35 196.30 B: mhm 

200.02 209.61 A: to chicago or to new york or texas or arizona the bigger states cities i mean i travel quite a bit and the whole thing of it is is that 

206.56 207.52 B: mhm 

209.80 211.04 A: um 

211.14 212.52 A: it it 

212.66 217.93 A: it's not hard if somebody wants to go to one of these smaller towns 

217.57 218.70 B: mhm 

218.12 220.41 A: and then get on one of these planes 

220.46 230.06 A: to to do the exact same thing or just create some kind of other mass type of destruction and the whole thing of it and to me the whole thing of it was is that the whole terr- 

225.01 225.81 B: yeah 

230.20 232.24 A: the whole use of 

232.93 233.96 A: um 

234.05 246.72 A: i guess the whole use of using the airplanes it it worked it got our attention but i don't think they're gonna go after that again they they've got what they wanted basically which was a war with the united states 

236.92 237.84 B: mhm 

246.75 247.70 B: mhm 

246.80 248.95 A: we're in the midst of a war now 

249.17 251.94 A: uh there's been many threats 

252.03 260.49 A: you know and whether they've been idle or not we're we're we're watching out for now my thorough belief is 

260.40 267.55 A: you know if they wanna do something or a terrorists wants to do something at that stage the terrorist in general wants to do something 

267.64 278.23 A: they'll do it they they can always claim recognition after it's been done and so you know when the when when they up security because oh they've got a tip on something 

272.58 273.59 B: mhm 

278.67 280.03 A: i'm not as 

280.72 286.25 A: [lipsmack] i'm not as convinced as it being more of a decoy than anything else 

286.12 286.97 B: yeah 

286.29 294.81 A: you know what and and we've been lucky we've been fortunate that war hasn't hit our soil in a long time we have been 

295.00 301.92 A: you know when when whenever the war comes to we always go to it you know vietnam and now and um 

300.79 302.16 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

302.14 312.03 A: so it was bound to happen it was sooner or later it was um it was a complete shock uh when it did happen uh 

312.28 313.28 A: so 

313.31 321.45 A: i think they've got the recognition i g- i think they got what they've done i think we should be more worried about terrorism within 

321.48 327.65 A: our country as a as a whole of of people inside our country actual citizens 

327.48 328.59 B: yeah 

328.00 329.92 A: uh as opposed to 

329.93 335.81 A: you know people being planted in here i think that i just like with that whole 

335.95 337.78 A: uh anthrax 

337.98 339.90 A: you know they found out that 

340.17 349.30 A: maybe the first couple of 'em were were originally to put out there then somebody else started copying and doing stuff and then you know 

348.20 356.91 B: yeah i don't i don't i don't even recall there being a definitive uh uh conclusion on what who they think that sent it but it seemed like 

354.74 355.56 A: (( [noise] )) 

356.85 364.01 B: the main thing was that it wasn't sent from outside right it was sent from some domestic source 

361.29 362.59 A: right it was 

363.78 367.52 A: it it started out uh as oh that they're doing it 

367.53 380.53 A: from outside and then later on they're they the more that they went into it they [noise] were looking and they were saying oh it was more of an inside source and then it kinda just faded away they never really [noise] went into it 

375.20 376.11 B: yeah 

380.00 394.75 B: yeah i'm still waiting i'm looking i i look for stuff like that and i mean they they just they basically buried the story i mean well of course it wasn't as newsworthy 'cause bigger and better things have happened since but i think it's important because 

395.01 409.30 B: i mean look at oklahoma city right i mean oklahoma city is a great example of something like like that when you're talking about terrorists i mean you should people have to pay attention to what's going on in their own country as well right 

408.91 411.13 A: right right and as 

409.89 418.67 B: and there are a lot of people who would love to take advantage of the fact that we're in the middle just embroiled in this situation with with with 

418.60 425.12 B: al qaeda or whatever other uh nations that we're have a tiff with just get in line now but uh 

425.15 428.94 B: um i mean there's a lot of domestic uh 

428.99 430.01 B: uh 

430.17 431.36 B: how do you say 

431.52 433.58 A: violence is happening within mm 

432.17 433.27 B: (( yeah viol- )) 

433.49 441.31 B: yeah just just domestic uh uneasiness or just uh dissatisfaction right with a lot of uh a lot of areas 

441.32 448.10 A: right there's always looking to be that and the worst part about it and the major problem that you have there is as i said you know 

448.15 453.57 A: you can't completely lock down the country you can't just say okay we're gonna 

453.86 460.12 A: plan for everything because until oklahoma city happened there were no procedures for that either 

459.81 460.81 B: yeah 

460.18 463.64 A: so it it just kinda you know people 

463.78 467.79 A: you know when they are saying it is a state of uneasiness well you know hey 

467.19 468.44 B: yeah 

467.87 475.18 A: there is a state of uneasiness who knows but you know it it th- th- the country should not 

475.58 479.85 A: shut down you know if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen 

479.91 484.93 A: until an- and and when it happens then the government or whatnot can take 

480.17 481.04 B: yeah 

485.85 487.32 A: basically 

487.42 492.36 A: the precautions or uh or or or or the procedures but until then 

491.18 491.99 B: yeah 

492.84 494.86 A: there's no use in trying to 

495.21 505.00 A: [noise] say oh okay well we're going to increase the airport security great great they've done that you know now what n- now there hasn't been any new threat and now it's 

505.48 510.14 A: just as a inconvenience for the customer actually more now but you know 

510.77 516.26 A: with that security it does give you some kind of security as you're entering a plane but you know what 

516.31 520.54 A: the whole thing of of belief is is if they want something bad enough 

520.84 527.21 A: they they they will whoever it is will find a way to to make whatever they want happen happen 

526.99 528.03 B: yeah 

527.35 533.65 A: because you know there's only so many things that you can watch against before you get into 

533.72 544.85 A: too much protection too much hindrance against the right too many problems with with our community because the more that you try to maintain it just kinda like um uh 

544.84 554.95 A: a a father with their daughter or their mother with their son you know they they they try to protect them from dating and all these all this bad stuff and no matter what no matter how much you protect 

554.77 555.84 B: yeah 

555.22 560.34 A: the it they will always get exposed to it now it it's just a matter of how 

560.62 570.82 A: that person or that community or however or whoever react re- react to that situation as how they handle it and that's basically it you 

570.97 574.29 A: know there's only so much that we can protect against before it's 

571.05 572.01 B: yeah 

574.53 578.40 A: [noise] before it gets as i said an infringement of people's rights 

578.24 583.78 B: yeah you sh- well i mean you have to remember that everyone still has to live right [laughter] exactly uh 

583.85 597.16 B: if if if you make life so res- burdened and and restrictive that's it's not worth really living and not enjoyable and actually just uh just a total bother to do anything then who's winning right 

596.76 599.95 A: right i i thoroughly agree and 

598.55 599.89 B: yeah who wins that one
