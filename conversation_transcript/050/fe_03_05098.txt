0.26 1.60 A: hello 

1.15 2.35 B: hi 

2.02 3.47 A: hi this is william 

3.18 5.58 B: hi i'm dennis where are you from william 

5.36 7.14 A: oh from california 

6.62 9.32 B: oh okay i'm from british columbia canada 

9.33 11.65 A: oh okay at least we're on the same time zone 

11.33 14.66 B: yes that's right how many have you done of these things 

12.71 13.59 A: how did you 

14.44 16.47 A: uh i think this is my third one 

16.04 18.53 B: okay yeah it's my third as well 

18.30 20.00 A: how did you find out about this 

19.85 24.87 B: uh just on the internet on the canadian mystery shoppers website 

24.93 29.37 A: really okay yeah 'cause i found out about this on craig's list 

25.54 26.95 B: yeah 

28.67 30.65 B: (( [noise] oh right okay )) 

30.32 34.03 A: yeah i didn't think that do they have craig's list up in uh in canada 

33.44 35.41 B: yeah we've got one in vancouver 

35.16 36.38 A: oh really 

35.81 37.05 B: yeah 

36.40 37.78 A: oh okay cool 

37.62 38.97 B: yeah 

38.28 40.00 A: yeah i suppose um 

40.28 41.45 A: yeah so 

42.15 44.83 A: i guess the what is the the topic is it uh does 

44.13 45.30 B: it's uh 

45.42 50.73 B: airport security and do you think it lessens the risk of um [lipsmack] terrorism 

53.54 63.29 A: it lessen the risk well i actually think that it will uh i don't think it lessens the risk but i do think that it's makes it more difficult for those 

58.71 60.52 B: mhm 

63.28 64.27 B: okay 

63.79 67.78 A: peop- for those people to execute it on uh on airplanes 

67.99 72.47 B: do you feel that uh if people really wanted to they're going to anyway 

72.76 76.46 B: if they wanted to use an airplane for terrorism purposes or whatever 

76.73 82.68 A: well i just think that having very good airport security will just lessen uh 

82.76 87.72 A: lessen the use of airports and planes as a viable venue 

87.59 89.19 B: right 

88.45 93.24 A: but however that'll just i guess shunt the uh 

93.99 98.45 A: [lipsmack] shunt the intentions of of terrorism towards other venues like for example 

98.68 100.26 A: (( let's say freeways )) 

100.43 101.36 B: okay 

101.39 105.43 A: or let's say uh common public squares 

105.70 107.62 B: mhm 

105.80 117.99 A: you know the more you tighten up on one area it just makes it you just uh you're just uh dampening their resolve but i mean providing more obstacles but i don't think you're lessening their intent to pro- uh 

114.82 116.02 B: (( [noise] right )) 

118.00 121.02 A: be a terrorist or or to conduct terrorist activities 

120.86 128.15 B: right um how difficult is it at your airports right now compared to what it was say three or four years ago 

129.01 132.67 B: to just go through an airport or is it quite demanding uh 

133.75 134.82 B: what's it like 

133.85 136.39 A: well i do think i think it's uh 

136.45 142.24 A: there's definitely much more delay involved because there's extra procedures that people have to go through 

142.02 142.94 B: okay 

143.04 144.53 A: right because 

144.66 147.38 A: before people didn't have to take off their shoes 

147.59 148.82 B: (( oh okay )) 

148.52 155.77 A: and yeah now pretty much at the major airports there's a random spot check and you may have to take off your shoes 

155.18 159.19 B: so how inconvenient do you find this or do you find it kind of a comfort thing 

161.96 165.99 A: i think it's a trade off there's a there's a trade off between 

163.52 164.34 B: (( uh-huh okay )) 

166.08 170.90 A: between the risk of of terrorist activity versus uh your own convenience 

171.22 174.98 A: sometimes uh after nine one one if you want if you want life 

175.18 177.95 A: very convenient it's not going to happen 

177.60 179.61 B: right 

178.32 185.14 A: yeah i i think there's a heightened awareness of the of of the fact that you have to make a trade off 

185.25 188.72 A: for security convenience for security 

186.57 187.47 B: okay 

188.21 192.96 B: do you think that this is generally accepted now it's going to be the way of life or do you think it's gonna go back 

194.28 197.59 B: the to the same kind of security we used to have 

197.69 199.42 B: let's say twenty years from now 

200.13 213.85 A: uh i don't [noise] yeah i think uh nine one one is is a watershed moment in u._s. history and i think for uh not just for the u._s. but i think uh globally as well basically that was maybe 

210.56 212.34 B: mhm 

213.84 217.12 A: whether it was the shock heard around the world you know 

217.25 218.06 B: right 

217.28 220.93 A: uh the modern version uh in terms of a wake up call 

220.76 222.44 B: mhm 

221.32 222.94 A: i think that uh 

223.87 234.87 A: if the terrorists who had planned the nine one one event wanted to wake the world up using the u._s. as an example it sure did that because nothing ever goes back to the way it were 

234.86 239.60 A: you know the way it once you know the way it was in the past it's forever changed 

239.34 240.16 B: right 

240.42 241.88 A: so i guess 

241.89 249.35 A: being in canada which is a major uh border point [laughter] ma- major uh you know uh 

249.85 253.87 A: uh major crossing point for traffic into the u._s. 

253.68 254.49 B: right 

254.17 254.95 A: uh 

255.70 261.37 A: what do you think uh what do you think the effects of um heightened uh 

261.44 265.24 A: border restrictions uh have imposed on your travel 

264.83 265.87 B: um 

265.95 274.93 B: i- it's actually become a real annoyance let's say it could be up to two hours now to get through the border where before it was like fifteen or twenty minutes 

271.70 272.73 A: [noise] right 

274.95 280.76 B: uh but at the same time i can understand you know it's y- you wanna make sure why uh 

280.92 285.77 B: why blow the whole thing and uh let one person in that's gonna make it worse for everyone 

285.98 296.54 A: yeah i was told that in the past people going in and out you know between you know who are canadian citizen citizens shopping on the other side of the border was was fairly commonplace 

293.48 295.73 B: oh yeah 

296.04 304.18 B: oh it was just like you stop at the border we're you going just shopping okay goodbye like that it was easy yeah what a dream eh for now it doesn't happen that way 

300.60 301.74 A: [laughter] 

303.81 307.03 A: so i mean where would you go from vancouver to seattle 

307.13 310.81 B: uh yeah you could or bellingham which is just across the border 

311.01 314.09 A: oh that's the city uh directly across the border 

313.71 314.95 B: yeah bellingham 

314.93 317.59 A: oh okay for some reason i thought it was seattle 

317.16 330.57 B: yeah well it's not very far we i actually live on vancouver island uh but the last time i went on the airport which was earlier this month they went through my bags piece by piece they took everything out of the bag and put it back it in 

329.41 330.17 A: wow 

330.74 336.05 B: now we're just a small little commuter plane going to vancouver that's how thorough they are 

336.12 337.24 A: (( wow [mn] )) 

336.69 343.90 B: and i don't know whether that's true in the u._s. airports or not but it certainly it took a long time to go through those lines i'll tell 

343.74 347.51 A: [laughter] with uh from vancouver island uh 

346.74 348.77 B: (( you yeah )) 

348.03 348.94 A: (( it- it's )) 

349.01 352.34 A: primarily uh ferries right there's no airport right 

351.82 358.49 B: yeah we got an airport too but yeah it's primarily ferries yeah we have a small compu- commuter plane there 

355.19 356.28 A: oh right 

358.84 362.76 A: i see even on the commuter plane airport the security has been uh 

361.99 364.33 B: it's unbelievable yeah 

363.61 364.69 A: wow 

364.48 365.95 B: yeah 

365.27 368.05 A: but how many people fit on the uh commuter plane 

367.71 369.88 B: oh i don't think more than sixteen 

369.91 372.33 A: more than sixteen people on there is that true 

371.04 373.30 B: i don't think so yeah 

372.58 373.93 A: (( and they're that thorough )) 

373.56 377.65 B: that that thorough it's unreal i was just blown away yeah 

376.94 378.03 A: wow 

377.76 380.92 B: and you know like they don't let you um take [noise] 

381.81 382.71 B: hello 

382.68 383.79 A: yeah 

383.20 395.49 B: they don't let you take anything on the plane uh like nail clippers or what have you but you know when they're serving meals to passengers on the major jets they serve it with knives and i thought isn't that interesting yeah 

388.04 389.32 A: right right 

395.36 396.79 A: [laughter] 

396.06 400.31 B: you know [laughter] so i mean where's this security thing 

399.53 407.29 A: what i'm just saying is you know if if the terrorists if they really have that kind of resolve you know i think they will do it they will find a way 

404.27 405.38 B: yes 

406.92 411.42 B: they will and there'll be you know it'll be different than anything we ever thought about i'm sure 

410.65 420.68 A: yeah exactly i mean but i do think that it does dampen their resolve and i i think if you make it very tough for them you know it does it it doesn't 

420.73 429.79 A: yeah it my premise in the beginning was that it just makes it more difficult for them to use uh traffic i mean airports and airplanes as a venue 

427.49 428.05 B: (( [noise] )) 

429.13 431.53 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

430.97 439.99 A: yeah i i think you i think really it really resides in the hearts and minds of those people who really intend to carry out the type act 

439.91 441.28 B: (( oh i think so )) 

440.97 447.53 A: so in order to really lessen terrorism you have to go to the breeding ground and and kind of uh unwash- 

447.78 451.64 A: unbrainwash them in terms of the type of uh 

449.43 450.33 B: yes 

452.35 453.94 A: (( uh [mn] )) 

454.83 463.76 A: jihad fervor or something you know you know uh just trying to make sure that you know they understand that that their 

463.80 473.37 A: that terrorism what they what they feel is te- what they feel is is uh not ter- no what they feel is justified is really uh 

473.49 479.21 A: unholy or ungodly according to their own religion you have to you have to pose it pose it like that 

476.73 478.18 B: [noise] oh yeah 

478.75 480.79 B: mhm 

479.35 490.62 A: now i guess yeah i mean lately i mean this has been a lot of uh people from the muslim countries or is- islam but it could be like any any uh like guerilla rebels from like third world countries 

485.73 486.60 B: right 

491.08 493.44 A: or it doesn't have to be from a particular religion 

493.26 494.15 B: right 

494.39 496.99 A: yeah i think that yeah the point is really you have to 

497.29 502.00 A: in order to lessen uh the use of terrorism uh you would have to 

502.56 504.07 A: uh go to the source 

503.26 506.88 B: you you have to go the source that's the root of the whole thing and 

505.98 520.05 A: that's the root of the whole thing so the u- uh i i do i would feel definitely i would feel more comfortable having heightened security uh to to mitigate or to reduce the the chances it's still gonna happen i think if people really want to 

507.10 508.98 B: yeah 

513.40 514.37 B: right 

516.85 517.67 B: okay 

519.67 521.89 B: do you feel uncomfortable flying 

522.00 528.19 A: no [laughter] no i feel that you know i i think uh it depends on philosophy about about life 

522.96 523.70 B: no 

527.79 529.19 B: mhm 

528.43 531.00 A: you know if it's going to happen [noise] it's going to happen 

530.68 531.86 B: yeah 

531.04 540.61 A: you know i think you don't want i think the fact that you are scared to use the use planes as a transportation venue means that the terrorists have won 

540.33 543.23 B: that's exactly right yeah 

541.92 547.88 A: you know so that they their their tactics or their means uh really uh 

548.12 550.40 A: they they went so 

550.10 552.25 B: mhm 

550.79 554.10 A: yeah you don't wanna give it to them and i think i mean 

554.12 561.05 A: for not trying to be too pro american but i do think that you do have to a decisive response 

561.30 562.48 A: you know uh 

561.98 564.79 B: i i absolutely agree yeah 

564.06 566.21 A: you know and i think you know uh 

565.44 571.82 B: otherwise what you're doing is opening up the door to say okay we're not going to do anything about it so come on ahead try it again you know 

570.55 578.01 A: yeah i i yeah exactly and to let them know that uh if you're gonna hijack a plane there are consequences 

577.69 578.67 B: (( yeah yes )) 

578.41 585.62 A: there are consequences you can't let people uh feel that there aren't none that they have a free sleight of hand 

585.18 587.31 B: right 

586.57 588.18 A: yeah yeah i guess um 

588.35 591.91 A: yeah i haven't been to canada yet so i really don't know the uh uh 

593.23 597.37 A: the the change in in security from uh from before 

597.07 599.96 B: [mn] well to give you an idea we just came back on a trip
