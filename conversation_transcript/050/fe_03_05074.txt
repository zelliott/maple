18.58 20.89 B: but huh you can start i'll let you be first 

20.57 22.96 A: [laughter] okay um 

23.34 28.68 A: [cough] it's an interesting topic today um you know i think um 

29.72 38.38 A: [lipsmack] i think heightened airport security um wouldn't stop a terrorist uh attack at all i 

37.18 38.77 B: if they really wanted to 

38.69 50.56 A: you're right i'm saying like if if somebody who's going to die and is going to kill themselves like there's there's no measure that you could possibly take i feel like to do anything about it 

50.15 55.02 B: i think it might stop some of the looser people that aren't as crazy as some of the really bad ones 

54.76 55.73 A: right 

55.19 59.45 B: because we just traveled again lately and i mean it does make you think a little bit 

59.50 65.06 B: more than what it was before i mean they take you and do side checks and everything else but i think if you're really that crazy it's 

65.20 67.61 B: really not going to really not stopping you 

66.62 67.61 A: i mean 

67.72 77.82 A: i think i think like the crazy crazy isn't even like the word i think it's more like like you know really smart but i guess you like i feel the- these people 

77.68 84.58 A: you know who'd do who would do any kind of terrorist attack definitely know exactly what they're doing and are 

84.80 90.47 A: very like you know informed about anything that we're doing uh which is why 

90.62 98.69 A: you know no matter what kind of procedures or measures we take they're going to you know go around them 

99.63 101.40 A: (( [cough] but )) 

101.92 104.60 A: i don't know it definitely it definitely probably 

105.01 106.45 A: it might 

107.22 109.01 B: have you traveled recently 

108.72 110.49 A: yeah i i definitely have 

110.76 123.61 A: i i definitely have been on an air- on an airplane and uh i like -ike i actually twice in the past uh year i went one way with only a carry on baggage so they uh 

122.35 124.18 B: and then they go right through everything 

124.03 126.12 A: oh yeah they definitely go through everything 

126.44 127.62 A: (( like um )) 

128.29 130.45 A: (( they uh they searched )) 

129.10 131.79 B: we traveled three times since since this year 

132.10 133.36 A: mhm 

132.34 136.58 B: it depends really on the airport i mean a lot of them take your shoes off and 

135.60 136.71 A: yeah yeah 

136.78 137.99 A: they they do 

139.06 140.04 A: um 

140.28 141.58 A: yeah like 

141.83 143.78 A: there's i i feel like 

144.61 147.05 A: there's definitely 

148.01 153.53 A: huh it's it makes it harder that's that's what is does but i i still don't 

153.75 158.28 A: (( you know i feel like if if someone if something if something's going to happen it's probably not going to )) 

159.01 166.65 A: you know if if it's not in your shoes then it's in your mouth and like you know i haven't you know [laughter] they didn't check that so 

166.94 167.98 B: (( they didn't what )) 

168.12 172.70 A: like like like let's say somebody like brings something in like in their mouth you know what i mean 

172.92 176.84 B: oh i had a girl in in detroit that made me open my mouth and go under my tongue 

176.93 178.38 A: mhm 

178.18 185.66 B: and she even checked my drink and made me take a dr- a drink of my drink to make sure there was no poison in it in detroit i'm serious 

183.23 184.49 A: (( [laughter] really )) 

185.77 186.96 A: (( yeah that's crazy )) 

186.65 191.21 B: i mean some of them i don't really know it's just depends on it wasn't even my drink i brought it on for the stewardess 

191.32 192.19 A: mhm 

192.88 195.00 B: so it it really depends i mean 

195.43 199.96 B: it might make some people stop but you never know i think like you said if they're that crazy to do it they're going to 

200.07 202.02 B: do it no matter what anythings 

201.68 204.08 A: (( right right most definitely )) 

204.58 205.56 A: um 

205.87 207.26 A: (( yeah i think )) 

206.45 208.70 B: maybe they'll go to another country instead 

209.42 215.10 A: mhm yeah that's that's true you know i mean like i i feel like 

215.31 228.35 A: to get any any kind of point across i feel like if they did it whether they were they were doing it in america or whether they were doing it in say like uh europe or uh israel or any place that really america uh 

228.63 235.19 A: (( has deeper interest in i feel like that it still would be getting the point across and probably they would do it easier )) 

235.91 237.79 A: but um 

240.30 241.08 A: (( yeah that's )) 

241.43 243.02 A: (( what i think about ))
