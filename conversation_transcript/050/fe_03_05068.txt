178.75 182.89 B: and basketball and football 

181.37 183.64 A: you know i i think fights might be 

183.04 186.56 B: mhm 

184.47 186.18 A: but 

186.24 194.00 A: i don't know i i've gone both ways on football and and basketball as well you know i um i spent some time in utah 

193.12 194.91 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

194.36 203.70 A: and so i became a jazz fan for a couple of years and you know just that there was one year there i can't remember it was probably five or six years back maybe a little bit longer that um 

202.96 203.76 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

203.52 210.69 A: you know the jazz were winning and then it came down to the last second shot and jordan hit it in the and you know the bulls won again 

205.57 208.57 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

210.98 220.69 A: and i couldn't help but think you know what what are the chances of that you know he's got the ball he's wide open he hits the shot you know it it was almost like you know too good to be true 

211.17 214.91 B: (( mhm )) 

220.81 224.78 A: 'cause they you know the utah that one year had i think it was ninety six 

224.60 225.71 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

224.96 226.83 A: uh you know they were 

227.29 235.20 A: i think the better team and then the bulls just came out on top and you think you know is it just because they were doing so well and bringing in so much money that they 

229.61 235.27 B: (( mhm )) 

235.37 238.37 A: you know they might have finished at the end just said you know 

238.84 243.52 A: chicago's a bigger sports area than utah is and let's let's make chicago win 

243.73 245.68 A: i don't know what do you think about that 

245.14 249.02 B: i i believe because see okay like the basketball they 

248.78 261.60 B: well you know they play good and then you can see in some games in some quarters like they're not playing at all and you know they're better than that they've got play they've got defence offence but they're not really defensing 

261.95 265.79 B: you know to me it's like they they're win they're losing on purpose 

266.61 269.17 B: you know because they they know i mean 

266.77 267.76 A: yeah 

269.27 272.13 B: i know they could play well and all of a sudden they just n- 

272.25 279.06 B: not playing at all [noise] you know they give up or something and the same thing with football it's like when they're 

273.77 275.02 A: right 

279.74 292.01 B: running for the ball i mean touch downs or passing it it seems like they throw it the quarter back throw it um [noise] throw mis-throw on purpose you know 

292.54 295.89 B: (( to i don't know it just don't seem right to me )) 

295.91 297.17 A: yeah right yeah 

296.28 299.27 B: 'cause i used to be a foot- i used to be a sports fan 

299.50 307.82 B: then i quit watching about six or seven years ago because of that you know because i got mad because you know what i know their play was good i know they could play better and i was probably 

308.75 312.95 B: they were just losing and it seemed like it was being they're either getting paid off 

313.94 319.93 B: to lose this game you know because you know they could play good also they just gives up 

319.97 321.72 A: right 

320.34 323.07 B: so sometimes i feel like they're just uh 

323.26 325.08 B: getting paid to um 

325.53 329.76 B: getting paid double or whatever to to lose that game 

328.92 330.16 A: you know maybe 

330.65 338.36 A: i i i remember you know the when the patriots won the super bowl of course i was happy and uh but the rams had played so well all year 

334.92 335.91 B: uh-huh 

336.85 340.62 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

338.60 348.68 A: and then i thought man what what happened to them you know i mean they almost came back and won it but then you know the patriots won and of course i was happy and then you know the year after at the last this past year 

341.32 342.67 B: (( [noise] )) 

348.85 350.69 A: the rams were terrible 

350.61 352.19 B: (( [noise] )) 

350.78 357.48 A: i thought well what happened they were so good last year then they got beat by the patriots in the super bowl and then from there it was just all down hill 

352.80 356.09 B: (( [laughter] )) 

357.97 364.25 B: (( [noise] yeah look at the lakers [laughter] look at the lakers last time the lakers )) 

357.98 360.17 A: so yeah you you may be right 

361.38 362.44 A: yeah 

363.93 365.07 A: yeah 

364.60 368.70 B: look at them look how they play you know just 

368.83 374.51 B: just seem like they just gave up i was really mad i was going for 'em [laughter] 

373.32 375.79 A: yeah they they have a lot of talent 

375.53 377.88 B: (( and i'll tell you they just threw it away )) 

379.33 380.75 B: (( just threw it away )) 

381.00 382.65 B: but uh 

383.33 391.88 B: i believe i don't know i'm not really into it but i believe they you know the money they're getting paid well with it [noise] 

389.76 390.72 A: yeah 

390.84 401.38 A: i guess so i mean one thing that surprised me was that high school kid lebron james you know getting almost a hundred million dollars just from a seek- sneaker deal he hasn't even graduated high school yet 

393.79 395.29 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

400.82 402.55 B: (( [noise] they gave him what )) 

401.89 404.26 A: uh that person lebron james 

403.70 405.08 B: [noise] uh-huh 

404.63 406.77 A: um he's a high school basketball player 

405.31 407.20 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

407.23 411.60 A: well he's going to be they say he's going to be the number one pick for the n._b._a. draft 

411.20 412.08 B: mm 

411.81 415.78 A: and nike already g- got a deal with him for sneakers 

415.29 416.25 B: uh-huh 

415.85 424.40 A: and it it's i think it's um five years or no maybe it's longer than that maybe it's ten years but it's worth ninety million dollars 

419.07 419.98 B: uh-huh 

421.76 422.76 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

424.20 425.76 B: (( whoa man )) 

425.52 430.55 A: and he's not you know he's still he's he's graduating here probably what in the next couple of weeks 

430.20 431.16 B: mm 

430.70 432.40 A: he's still in high school 

432.00 445.48 B: okay put it this way put you in put yourself in their shoes would you be happy [laughter] [laughter] huh you know would you think that you're getting overpaid [laughter] 

437.20 439.92 A: oh yeah no i'd i'd certainly be happy 

440.14 442.46 A: yeah i don't blame him for doing what they you know 

444.42 447.60 A: no i'd say i think i'd be getting it just right [laughter] 

446.50 458.37 B: [noise] yeah believe it or not some of them uh think they're getting underpaid they're not getting paid right 

452.52 453.44 A: right 

453.74 457.02 A: well it's hard when- you know like if a certain team is willing to pay 

457.30 466.38 A: you know ten million dollars and someone else says well i'm just as good as he is but that he's only getting eight million you know he says well i need to get at least ten because i'm better than him 

466.15 471.09 B: [noise] [noise] exactly [noise] yeah 

466.79 469.16 A: and that's how it just keeps going higher and higher 

471.68 482.73 B: yeah i believe they're all right so i don't care you know but i still think them getting basketball or football and boxing i know boxing is for sure 

482.77 484.53 B: is a fixed game 

484.95 486.03 A: yeah 

485.36 486.36 B: (( you know )) 

486.80 488.68 B: politics coming in 

488.86 493.66 B: say you going to lose this and if that team wins we're going to pay you this and that 

494.00 502.18 B: that's in a lot of games you know if they they just they're not playing they play good out there so that you know they they could play better and they don't play better at all 

502.45 505.41 B: they don't play right [noise] 

504.54 510.48 A: right especially you know when a couple of years ago when when uh mike tyson was in his prime 

510.68 515.42 A: you know he played people in it'd be you know twenty seconds and the fight was over 

510.84 511.53 B: (( [noise] )) 

515.90 518.32 B: (( [laughter] )) 

516.67 523.84 A: you think a professional fighter and the guy gets punched once and he's out like i don't know so you think you know it must be that was all a hype 

524.11 526.24 B: (( you yeah )) 

524.18 529.58 A: said you know you go down right you get hit once you go down and you know we'll give you this much money 

529.48 531.81 B: that's what it is 

530.82 532.04 A: yeah 

531.82 537.36 B: [laughter] i think that's what it is you know but they're fighting and all of sudden 

538.29 547.82 B: sometimes on boxing now sometimes i you know what you well i can tell i i believe it be fixed because the way they fight and all of a sudden they're down wait a minute 

548.30 554.19 B: you know the fight you fight you got back up or you you know and you keep you're not tired i don't believe they be really tired 

555.04 560.39 B: like that fifteen seconds uh before a minute have got that fight over with 

560.36 562.05 A: right 

561.41 565.96 B: that's a straight fix there so 

564.71 570.09 A: yeah but they get their money you know they've still got plenty of people coming out to watch them 

569.36 574.74 B: (( [noise] oh yeah they're getting they got a lot of people watching them [noise] and )) 

573.01 576.16 A: and i guess that's really the bottom line 'cause it's a business 

575.84 577.60 B: then exactly [noise] 

576.75 581.19 A: you know yeah we'll pay you ex amount of money as long as people keep coming 

578.39 579.82 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

579.61 589.70 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

581.98 585.18 A: if people don't come they'll find a reason to get you get rid of you 

589.71 594.78 B: i believe it's okay they if i was in their shoes 

595.90 599.95 B: i don't then then again you know by them being professional athletes
