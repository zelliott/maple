35.31 36.31 A: yes 

36.52 48.08 B: um i was thinking actually that would be kind of a i'm not too uh up to date on what's going on in the world with all the terrorist attack things uh so i thought gosh i wonder if i should be talking about this 

48.24 57.13 B: but uh i've done a lot of travelling recently so if anybody's been through a lot of security at airports that would be me [laughter] how about you 

55.47 61.08 A: [laughter] i've been in laguardia and kennedy and logan and boston 

60.74 63.76 B: oh wow you've done your fair share of travelling recently 

62.48 65.19 A: yeah yeah 

64.46 66.59 B: what do you think of the security 

65.98 76.66 A: the security's good but they're not uh it's not really full security because uh things do still get by i've seen it happen with th- yes i have 

73.91 75.22 B: oh have you 

76.76 84.49 A: and uh it was a big write up in the uh new york post it was two weeks ago matter of fact of this in this month and it was uh 

84.32 96.09 A: that they found some hand guns in laguardia airport they went right past them and everything and i think the you know the s- the security's bad in airports i mean it's y- y- y- things do get through 

87.30 88.64 B: oh my god 

95.98 97.82 B: oh i'm not surprised i 

97.12 104.14 A: things still get through and you know while everyone's worried about security they should of they should plan a more they should they should plan more and uh 

98.04 99.01 B: yeah 

104.17 108.31 A: since the terrorist attacks i've seen it down in brooklyn i lost a relative 

107.89 110.38 B: oh my gosh i'm so sorry 

109.21 113.50 A: you know when it happened and it's it's it's very poor 

112.83 115.65 B: how did you get to see what actually went through 

116.13 117.90 B: were you there when it went through 

117.48 121.35 A: well i saw on t._v. i was down in the city when it happened 

119.59 123.63 B: oh i thought you meant you were like right there in the airport when you saw it oh 

122.83 125.52 A: well with the guns yeah i've seen it right through it 

125.41 133.38 B: i just how do you think that that happens i mean with the metal detectors and x. rays how does that stuff even get through i don't understand that 

132.65 135.20 A: just does ther- there's manpower 

135.65 138.62 A: there's less manpower it's money 

138.05 139.08 B: (( oh )) 

138.70 144.16 A: it's money they should you know more security there's there's you know how many people go you been to laguardia airport and kennedy 

143.73 146.22 B: uh no actually no i haven't 

145.08 147.67 A: there's millions of people that go right through every day 

147.69 148.82 B: wow 

148.22 163.16 A: but when you go through albany albany is i think out of new york city is the most the most safest one because even when greyhound goes through they they go through a detector and everything i mean there's there's there's regular police law enforcement there's the national guard there you know there's you 

154.46 155.41 B: mhm 

162.51 163.36 B: oh 

163.34 175.76 A: know they go people from fort drum new york right there that- that's the army base up there they got people down there yeah it's the capital for new york city and they don't have a laguardia or you know kennedy airport you know 

167.73 168.84 B: oh 

170.38 172.00 B: yeah 

175.91 186.32 B: i haven't seen anything happen personally um i've really honestly don't keep up with the news so my mom tells me what's going on in the world and i'm like oh okay i didn't hear anything about it um 

186.61 199.99 B: but personally just you know going through the airport security [mn] all i know is my my belt and my shoes always set the thing off [laughter] so they're always telling me okay you gotta come over here and one time i was wearing a trenchcoat 

194.52 196.72 A: [laughter] 

199.76 211.90 B: and i went through and oh gosh sound the alarms uh you know [mn] up came on the uh p._a. system female coming through wearing long black trenchcoat blah blah blah you know i was like 

210.34 212.13 A: yeah 

212.01 221.28 B: oh i i kinda thought oh give me a break but another part of me thought actually that's good because the least in the world that could look like a terrorist is me 

221.21 224.45 B: but that would be the best suspect you know 

224.13 225.96 A: yeah 

224.38 236.71 B: the little five foot two female who would ever suspect somebody like me so i was actually i i thought okay yeah that's that is actually good it's almost a shame that it would be a waste of their time because i wasn't carrying anything 

236.16 241.52 A: (( yeah )) 

237.37 238.29 B: um 

239.23 241.99 B: but i yeah i haven't uh 

242.10 250.47 B: i haven't seen anything unusual or i just i just always wonder now how anything does happen to get through and 

250.70 252.19 B: and i just 

252.32 263.76 B: like even your own story right there i i know stuff does still get through and i just i don't know i don't understand where these people are hiding it with you know with the x ray machines and the metal detectors 

263.89 265.26 B: it just you know 

265.48 270.97 B: and actually i was thinking that after this you know aft- oh i'm sorry 

268.59 269.46 A: (( i just )) 

270.90 273.22 A: i think they just rush everything right through 

273.37 275.66 A: they don't even be bothered with things 

275.53 283.35 B: yeah that's probably it you think it's because they're in a hurry and they just see stuff and think oh who cares no- nothing's gonna happen with that 

280.04 281.89 A: yeah 

282.68 285.72 A: they just look for sus- suspicious people 

285.26 293.84 B: and honestly i've i've had stuff even in my carry on bag that i forgot that i had that i wondered how it got through like um 

293.88 301.42 B: m- after my dad died i carry his ashes an- and a metal cross that he made on every trip that i take and i keep it in my carry on 

301.25 303.54 A: and they never checked it 

301.44 302.44 B: and 

302.49 316.25 B: um they've shaken the box and i've had to open it before um but most of the time it just goes right through and i think wait a minute why did that metal cross go through i could still do damage with a metal cross if i really wanted to come one 

307.64 308.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

314.29 316.47 A: yeah that's right 

316.30 326.52 B: and um i i carry around a little trinket of mine and it happens to have a couple of safety pins in it now i know safety pins are no big deal but it's still a metallic 

326.74 333.15 B: sharp object and i think wait a minute why didn't why didn't that set something off even why wasn't i questioned about that 

327.93 329.74 A: yeah 

333.47 343.51 B: and when you think about it there's just so much that people could be carrying even even plastic knives and forks and things that could still do damage 

341.85 343.17 A: (( i know it )) 

343.28 345.69 A: it can be as a weapon to take over you know 

344.92 358.32 B: right right oh we won't we won't allow tweezers we won't little tiny mini scissors we won't allow this we won't allow that but it's like who's to say that a woman's really really long fingernail can't puncture an eye just as easily as anything else 

356.50 361.05 A: (( [noise] that's it that's it i know it )) 

358.38 359.74 B: give me a break 

359.97 363.29 B: it's just it would it would be absolutely impossible 

362.90 364.17 A: that's true 

363.45 370.81 B: to make the airlines one hundred percent totally safe and it's just it's scary and it's sad 

367.41 368.89 A: that's true 

370.92 378.01 B: and um even well even before my dad died he he died after the whole september eleven thing happened 

377.91 386.72 B: i told him i feel so guilty being alive today and he said oh no you shouldn't feel guilty you should feel very blessed to be alive and it wasn't you and i said 

384.56 387.00 A: yeah 

386.50 395.13 B: i i just feel like there are so many more important people in the world that got hit by that that didn't deserve that that deserved to be alive 

394.54 395.53 A: yeah they 

395.23 396.30 B: and 

396.48 400.34 B: and i just i wondered i asked my mom and my dad back then 

400.27 401.25 B: um 

401.06 406.73 B: if they thought maybe the airline airport security thing was gonna start 

406.51 419.98 B: getting a little bit slack in a few years you know because oh and all the worst is already over with that osama he did his job we found this and that guy oh we found the black boxes we know what's going on there and 

408.55 410.29 A: yeah 

418.96 421.91 A: but they still haven't catched the two people 

421.11 423.13 B: right right yeah 

422.47 423.67 A: there's no proof 

423.42 425.73 B: and him himself 

424.43 427.91 A: yeah and him himself you know they're just still pretty somewhere 

427.20 428.95 B: yeah who knows 

428.30 431.63 A: who knows where they are if they're dead but they know they they're alive 

431.06 431.98 B: right 

431.74 433.98 A: now and you know clinton and bush 

434.17 441.90 A: you know bush's father and clinton could have done something they they had him nailed they could've they had a delta force ready to kill him they don't wanna do nothing 

441.10 447.54 B: i yeah i don't understand that why wouldn't they do something if something could have been done get it done 

447.76 452.51 B: say you know if they could save people i mean something has to be going on 

450.76 460.52 A: they could i in my opinion this all could have been prevented look at upstate new york and and um it's to new york all those terrorists that were living right there 

460.08 460.97 B: mhm 

460.57 463.34 A: and right you know you heard about that 

462.40 464.61 B: oh no i'm just i'm just agreeing 

463.59 476.94 A: in buffalo new york they had they had eleven terrorists and you know what happened there were a kid found out what was going on and the f._b._i. they just somehow they they were suspicious but they didn't investigate so they finally busted and they were terrorists from islam you know 

464.83 465.64 B: okay 

476.96 483.21 A: they were planning something they found maps and everything they were gonna bomb uh uh on albany new york 

483.64 497.31 B: mhm actually you know i think my mom has a pretty good and very point that even even if we do wipe out saddam hussein and osama and all the rest of these guys who's to say there's not ten ten thousand of 'em ready to just 

495.61 508.33 A: well look at that female look at the female dr death that bioc- scientist yeah look what about her they never mentioned yeah and they're not even on they're not even doing nothing about her 

497.26 498.75 B: back right up you know 

500.82 502.14 B: yeah yeah 

503.26 505.56 B: dr germ or whatever she's called 

507.42 508.83 B: i know 

508.37 512.48 A: and she's a genius she says remember something's gonna happen she's warning us 

512.47 513.39 B: uh-huh 

513.05 522.32 A: you know if you if you look in the in the [lipsmack] library look in the old news like last year when the bom- the b- it was nine eleven she warned us something will happen 

513.51 514.36 B: yeah 

521.79 522.99 B: (( yeah )) 

522.41 526.17 A: what about airborne what about in the water system 

525.18 527.48 B: oh i know it's just endless 

527.51 529.31 B: and it's just terrifying 

528.50 532.03 A: you can't sa- you can't safeguard everything no 

530.17 532.92 B: no way no there is no way 

533.53 534.37 B: it 

533.57 534.47 A: (( you know )) 

534.38 546.12 B: how uh i don't understand why it is that on domestic flights i haven't seen any dogs sniffing anything out i've taken a couple of international flights recently and the dogs were only sniffing there 

546.58 552.78 B: now i mean can't these dogs also be trained for you know weapons or anything i don't know anything 

551.90 560.75 A: they can do it for drugs and all that they can they can yeah they can probably do for you know just suspicious they can probably do weapons they can probably be trained you know 

553.39 554.25 B: yeah 

559.21 560.09 B: mhm 

561.62 573.25 B: i just think of all the you know all the little metallic things that are even on just on my shoes who's to say that something like that i just can't you know whip off and use as a weapon it's just 

572.41 575.98 A: like that guy would have had that that shoe bomb remember that shoe bomb 

575.37 577.55 B: i know yeah yeah
