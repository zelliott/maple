119.13 120.25 A: and like you 

120.29 124.59 A: know if all the if the corporations are making so much money 

124.75 133.02 A: on off these like teams and stuff i mean like it's part of the entertainment industry and like if they're making so much money then 

133.02 139.90 A: like any of their employees no matter what they do should be able to like get what they consider a fair share of that 

141.35 145.37 B: yeah i mean they're they're they're the reason they're pulling in all that money anyways i guess 

145.03 146.12 A: (( right [sigh] ))

171.23 178.34 A: yeah and they got they got a union they got the str- screen actors' guild which is their union so 

173.20 173.92 B: (( [mn] [mn] [sigh] )) 

178.64 180.70 A: i don't see why uh 

180.99 181.99 A: why 

182.02 186.47 A: professional athletes shouldn't be able to have their unions and go on strike when they want to [noise] 

189.54 195.48 B: interesting yeah [noise] i guess just there's that some sort of miscommunication there somewhere 

195.60 199.01 A: yeah i think it's just rich people wanting to 

199.21 201.05 A: keep making lots of money 

201.37 203.66 A: [sigh] that's what it's about and 

203.72 208.31 A: i i think like in the past i don't know about recent strikes but in the past [sigh] 

208.32 209.61 A: when uh 

209.98 215.15 A: they've tried to play off it's like oh they're betraying their fans and whatever [sigh] 

215.38 216.82 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh really )) 

215.52 216.34 A: and like 

216.60 224.64 A: yeah and i mean that's a bunch of bullshit like whatever you're betraying the fans by like making all this money like 

225.06 229.13 B: right charging eight bucks for a hotdog ten bucks for a beer [laughter] 

228.58 230.08 A: yeah 

229.58 232.71 B: (( right get your point )) 

231.05 232.22 A: so 

232.60 235.63 A: can't really i don't think you can blame like 

235.75 245.18 A: the athletes which are pretty much like the workers it's more the the owners and the manag- or like the team managers and stuff 

245.13 246.43 B: right 

245.87 247.31 A: that are like 

247.95 253.89 A: and all the raking in the big bucks for the advertising and concessions and stuff like that [sigh] 

253.90 257.19 A: and selling all the jerseys and shit 

256.87 258.69 B: right 

258.73 261.55 A: athletes don't get a cut of that stuff 

261.56 263.57 B: is that right 

262.92 270.41 A: i mean i don't think they would get a cut of like selling jerseys or anything that [noise] money goes to the team [noise] 

271.27 275.06 B: well that's a great c- yeah it's not i w- yeah i wondered that 'cause like jack 

275.08 277.82 B: i heard something like when jack nicholson did like uh 

278.24 288.40 B: the batman movie he like wanted uh uh this huge amount of money for all like the dolls and paraphernalia i never even thought about that what a like they make jerseys with like a player's number on it 

287.85 289.47 A: (( mhm )) 

288.93 294.93 B: yeah i i wonder if that has anything like it's not their copyright it's just like i wonder if it's just the team's 

294.58 298.78 A: yeah i think it's the team [noise] i mean i don't know for sure though 

299.11 301.93 B: (( well that's an interesting thought hm )) 

302.54 303.77 B: yeah i've kind of 

303.56 318.40 B: fallen out of following sports i played sports a lot while i was in school but now i'm kind of like focussed on other kinds of things [laughter] what i what what's that being like uh sort are they trying to like form a union in sports now is that kind of 

312.06 312.94 A: yeah

322.36 325.59 B: do you mean there is a union kind of just basically like uh 

326.19 331.44 B: kind of like putting people all together into like one unit so they have more power to 

330.85 332.14 A: yeah 

331.67 335.75 B: with wages and i guess terms of working environments 

333.52 334.19 A: y-

374.27 375.17 B: (( gotcha )) 

375.41 376.75 B: you don't have a union 

376.61 378.46 A: right 

379.41 382.78 B: where i work they don't have a there's no union there either 

379.42 380.40 A: yeah 

383.35 385.85 A: what what kind of work's that 

385.50 387.86 B: uh i work in computers at a company it's 

387.88 396.67 B: a privately held company so it's not no union nothing nothing really actually there you can yell all you want but they'll just fire you 

392.07 393.11 A: right 

397.32 402.83 B: [mn] i guess that doesn't really happen it's like a barry bond or someone big [laughter] you get your 

397.98 399.05 A: yeah 

403.89 407.87 B: get lost 'cause then all your sales go down 'cause they kind of bring all the fans 

408.20 409.23 A: uh-huh 

411.09 412.74 B: (( [mn] yeah they just kind of )) 

413.04 420.71 B: yeah i don't didn't really hear of any new uh new strikes or anything like what's going on in hockey is there is there anything going on there 

420.59 423.52 A: uh d- have no idea [laughter] 

423.61 427.97 B: i know there's like playoffs are going on there in basketball or maybe the final so far i don't know 

427.98 430.05 B: i know the celtics aren't in it so 

430.31 431.82 B: who cares that much 

431.54 433.00 A: yeah [laughter] 

432.71 433.47 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

434.14 434.81 A: (( [noise] )) 

435.35 435.91 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

437.07 443.43 A: so i mean i don't know i guess traditionally from what i understand unions 

444.50 454.72 A: aren't haven't like there haven't been very many unions for like people who are considered professionals mostly unions like have been representing like 

455.08 456.35 B: oh right 

455.11 459.36 A: people who do like like the lower paying jobs 

459.26 461.36 B: yeah like the ma- like the yeah 

461.77 462.97 A: but uh 

461.95 466.26 B: like trade jobs right is that that's what they get classified as right 

465.64 467.16 A: what's that 

466.59 469.67 B: in don't they classify it as like trade jobs 

469.73 471.79 B: like people who are in a trade like 

471.22 473.20 A: right trade unions 

472.90 474.18 B: right 

473.61 476.27 A: yeah but i guess 

474.46 475.45 B: (( [mn] [noise] [noise] )) 

476.34 481.19 A: i mean i remember hearing like maybe a year or so ago about like 

481.36 485.29 A: i guess white collar workers unionizing like uh 

485.68 489.84 A: boeing engineers or something like that and going on strike 

488.58 489.42 B: wow 

490.34 495.55 A: so that's interesting i don't know i don't think i have much hope for really for unions i think they're 

495.67 502.27 A: they're kind of good but they're not like the best thing in the world or anything like 

502.28 503.28 A: (( i don't th- i )) 

503.22 503.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

503.41 505.59 A: (( mean like i don't know )) 

505.75 509.65 B: [mn] they could also tear i mean completely like tear up a company i 

509.76 511.95 A: yeah 

511.50 517.78 B: mean if the you know union wants more wages but there's not i i guess at the same token because i we're like we're talking about you know 

517.58 528.27 B: ath- athletics so like when you say like well can they really not pay them more well they probably can afford to pay those guys more wherein my job you know can they afford to pay the warehouse guys thirty buck an hour 

528.05 534.54 B: probably not [laughter] it's probably you know the company would go go under if if they ever did something like that 

534.04 536.04 A: right well i 

536.16 540.82 A: mean if they can't afford to pay like a decent wage then 

541.48 542.33 A: (( like )) 

543.35 548.98 A: i don't know then they're probably doing something else wrong and they're not like and they'd go out of business anyway so 

543.91 544.47 B: (( [mn] )) 

548.93 552.22 B: yeah and so um not a good you know business plan or whatever 

553.40 554.32 B: (( hm )) 

555.52 558.94 B: well i guess we then agree that 

559.43 565.89 B: going on strike is not is not necessarily a horrible thing for them 

559.47 560.39 A: yeah 

566.05 567.43 A: yeah i i 

566.64 572.77 B: i guess the whole point of it like you said it's an entertainment industry well does that does them getting more money would that make them 

572.83 574.34 B: perform better 

574.80 583.51 B: in i mean i guess if so and it makes it more exciting for the fans then i guess it's totally worth it 'cause the whole point of them doing anything is because of the fans [noise] 

584.21 585.55 A: well i mean 

585.59 599.89 A: regardless i think of whether they perform better or not i think like they have a right to have control at least some control over their own work you know like how much they get paid and i guess they feel like they're
