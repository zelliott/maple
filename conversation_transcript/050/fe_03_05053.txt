35.14 37.29 A: st- uh i 

37.31 38.81 A: thought well 

38.87 47.03 A: (( the last time i think that wasn't they've that's a few years ago basketball oh basketball kind of have a semi strike )) 

46.42 48.98 B: oh they sure did okay yeah 

47.76 53.95 A: yeah and they did in baseball you know had a couple of them that i know of 

54.02 56.34 B: yeah did you think it was a big deal 

57.07 67.32 A: well it is a big deal because all the fans you know the basketball like myself i am not a die fan diehard fan you know so 

67.46 75.36 A: i can take it or leave it you see but the problem is there are some fans who are so 

75.44 79.25 A: up touch you know to the sport 

79.36 80.09 B: (( mm )) 

79.39 92.50 A: you know if they like and some you know s- we have some junkies who watch every any sport but you know we have some people who are touch in one y- one type of sport and without that sport they feel lost you know 

88.91 89.91 B: mhm 

92.27 102.77 B: yeah i me personally i didn't think it was a big deal and like i'm lucky like i watch sports but i'm not a diehard fan so i couldn't really care less [laughter] 

92.93 94.17 A: (( so [sigh] )) 

96.12 97.09 A: mhm 

99.50 100.73 A: (( i- i- i- it )) 

101.18 113.25 A: yeah i was i didn't care less but i know some people who are like close to me like when baseball when they had a strike you know just when before the uh [lipsmack] 

113.10 118.10 A: world series and things like that that was a very uh 

118.55 122.42 A: that that was i would call that you know uh [mn] 

123.09 130.95 A: a very uh kind of uh a slap to the fan you know you don't do that to fans like they were and especially we know 

126.37 127.64 B: yeah 

130.86 140.01 A: most people they watch during the play offs and the last game like basketball championships and the finals you know things like that so if 

139.89 147.70 A: anybody and they don't mind me seeing like one regular season game and some people they even buy 

147.91 151.78 A: season tickets just because of the play offs 

151.15 152.82 B: that's true [mn] 

152.16 157.38 A: [mn] yeah but when you see when you do that to fans you know that 

157.35 167.47 A: that's not something but basketball you remember like that was i don't know that was about four years ago probably when they only have a fifty game season 

164.48 165.94 B: yeah i remember that 

167.51 168.81 A: because 

167.81 169.02 B: yeah 

168.82 176.46 A: the strike was you know they were like in a deal back and [noise] forth and [mn] well for me i don't know 

176.25 185.64 A: i know these people they have the talent and picture how many millions of people who would like to make it in any type of sport but they can't 

185.02 186.17 B: yeah 

185.51 200.20 A: and the ones who made it i'd i can be judgemental because if i can have even one hundred thousand dollars i would i would be so happy to have it and these people they making millions and they not satisfied so 

192.31 194.22 B: (( [laughter] )) 

199.36 202.03 B: do you think it's fair that they make high salaries 

201.77 212.81 A: [sigh] i l- let's put it this way i am kind of uh mixed you see you know i am kind of mixed because the point is 

212.78 220.72 A: i can realize when there is one game on the line and like one free point that would make all the difference 

220.78 230.69 A: and the people they pay this money and they get like so much you know like talk from other people the sportscaster the fans 

230.80 238.60 A: and you know they even like hug them you know like y- you kind of making fun of them so you choke or you this you do that i 

238.57 251.67 A: i don't know how i feel about that i think maybe that their luck and you know they are in the position to make the millions uh uh f- pass on l._a. it doesn't affect me because i don't 

251.63 257.39 A: [mn] i don't know if i go to any game in this stadium i just watch it on t._v. so 

257.63 264.29 A: in a way like i say you know i am not if i would be the one paying that kind of money 

264.60 274.79 A: [mn] i would probably feel very you know bad about it but to me like i said i can take it or leave it but some people i know they don't mind paying like 

274.72 285.68 A: you see like lakers game you know people are paying eight hundred dollars you know for a season ticket like the last day michael jordan was playing the lakers the 

285.64 286.79 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

286.21 295.51 A: season ticket was i i heard the i heard and i can't you know i can't confirm that it was like even the high 

295.53 307.26 A: they were like in six thousand and some dollars you know uh people like me and i know people who pay it they can afford it you know they in hollywood and things like that but 

307.19 307.75 B: (( [noise] )) 

307.47 315.22 A: but i don't see myself paying you know even like three four hundred dollars for a ticket [laughter] you know tha- 

313.56 317.59 B: yeah and i i i mean i think that professional athletes 

317.19 318.06 A: (( mhm )) 

317.37 326.87 B: i'm kind of split too like i think they deserve the salary because [sigh] it is such a competitive field and there aren't too many people in the world that are like six feet [noise] and taller and that can play like that 

318.99 319.98 A: yeah 

320.54 321.58 A: mhm 

325.62 326.33 A: (( oh yeah )) 

326.57 327.82 A: yeah 

326.75 340.96 B: but at the same time it's like [mn] uh why not put more emphasis on academics i mean the people who can be computer scientists there's not that many people who can do that too why aren't they making that kind of money [sigh] but i guess there's more of the entertainment field and america caters to entertainment so 

331.09 332.29 A: yeah 

336.01 337.40 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

340.25 341.48 A: mhm 

340.87 353.85 B: you know it's it it follows it's entertainment just the same as actors they do they're just talking it doesn't take much to talk or just singers nowadays you don't really have to sing [mn] you just go in the studio and they make your voice sound good but it's entertainment so 

346.69 348.13 A: yeah 

350.21 351.12 A: (( [laughter] )) 

353.27 355.04 A: uh yeah 

353.71 361.32 B: i i think it's kind of fair that they make that kind of money and if you're one of those people that are fortunate and blessed to be in the industry that's great [sigh] but 

359.77 360.89 A: yeah 

360.90 364.21 A: (( they are under a lot of pressure too you can realise )) 

363.38 364.40 B: yeah 

364.20 378.73 A: and this is what i don't know like especially people like athletes or you know performers in any kind i don't know when they are up why they don't try to capitalize on that and save save save save 

378.73 382.35 A: see you take you see people like you know they can 

378.78 380.10 B: (( oh okay )) 

382.38 397.26 A: [mn] like you say you know they don't have any academies they don't have the business savvy and anything and they they can buy me and make all this money but when you come down to the payments they don't spend even like you know half of it 

396.90 400.50 B: and then too i think it's something to consider that 

398.73 399.29 A: (( [mn] )) 

400.09 400.94 A: (( mm )) 

400.37 403.94 B: they are making a lot of money but at the same time their job 

403.86 412.53 B: their job is kind of harder than the average job 'cause they don't have an average job same as the rest of us like some people in corporate america they'll get their job they have it for twenty years 

409.64 410.35 A: (( uh [mn] )) 

412.06 413.16 A: (( yeah uh )) 

412.45 419.09 B: but if you're in professional sports you can only play prob- i would think a maximum of like maybe eight years on average it's probably even less than that 

417.21 418.61 A: yeah 

418.69 432.54 A: eight then you have to be lucky to go like about in basketball when you picture like even it's only people said well two hours and a half you pay that that much money again but going back and forth you know 

421.16 422.41 B: yeah 

429.57 430.90 B: yeah and they 

432.35 440.18 A: and the preparation and all these things to do like i said i am not against it because i don't pay the money 

440.28 449.52 A: you know if i would have to pay the money maybe i would have a different view or i don't know and then first of all they don't force me to pay it anyway [mn] 

448.92 460.25 B: yeah and they have a lot of things to consider like they travel a lot and then it's very hard on their bodies like they you know they could get hurt and that's their whole career at any given point or they could die you know [laughter] you know 

451.11 453.29 A: yeah oh yeah 

454.11 455.31 A: oh yeah 

456.89 458.38 A: oh yeah and then 

458.69 465.15 A: and they don't have a good life a stable life these people they have no privacy y- 

461.63 462.96 B: yeah 

463.49 474.93 B: exactly and then you know it's like a team could call you they could trade you as like you're a you know they just trade you and you have to move your whole family and your whole life to another state so it- it's kind of inconvenient [laughter] 

468.09 469.33 A: yeah 

471.43 483.56 A: (( it's very humiliating yeah yeah you can be like in milwaukee like look at ray allen i don't know if you are you know he was in milwaukee thinking you was going to finish )) 

483.19 484.36 B: yeah 

483.73 489.03 A: you know his career and then look at paper and you know when you look at him 

488.96 494.03 A: seattle you know supersonics you just see he got repayment you know 

493.78 494.85 B: yeah 

493.97 505.42 A: and then this is an- and every time they tell you it's a business it's a business it's very humiliating it looks like sometimes and you don't have you can sometimes you just can't make a basket 

505.10 506.27 B: yeah 

505.41 508.52 A: and sometimes you can make you know everywhere you turn 

508.51 513.60 A: around you make it you know if there are any bad shots or whatever you made it and 

513.61 523.75 A: and the thing is if you are lucky enough to be like somebody like shaquille o'neal kobe bryant and michael jordan but you don't have those those many you know 

523.27 524.88 B: exactly so 

524.21 527.26 A: in every team you only have one person 

527.12 528.17 B: yeah 

527.46 532.12 A: who is the franchise or star player is that what they call it you know 

532.19 540.03 A: (( [mn] and once these players and for some reason i think the players who are around them they make it [mn] )) 

540.09 547.85 A: really like you know these player is the star because without shaquille o'neal you see the lakers you know they struggled 

547.27 549.07 B: that is very true 

548.41 551.55 A: (( yeah look at miami here without )) 

551.69 559.71 A: they made the play offs all the time but without him you know because he was out then they you know you they they 

560.25 566.29 A: you know things like that so like i said you have to respect when they be like shaquille o'neal 

566.37 574.51 A: they pay him all this money they pay him i'm not against that because he's working hard all the night in and night out you know that's 

574.77 586.74 A: that's very hard that takes a toll on the body you know and and believe me after you leave it and if you are if they smart enough maybe they will set for life 

586.90 599.87 A: but apparently some people they waste their money so much and they kind of extravagant and everything and here they are you know when they come down to earth and they don't have anything left
