71.51 73.26 B: (( [noise] [noise] okay )) 

71.87 77.50 A: (( so that kind of bothered me just because of the fact that they were down and then of course all the people that was in it [noise] [noise] ))

77.34 90.47 B: yeah man that's [noise] crazy i mean i wasn't born in [noise] this country but i've been living here for six years and and i really feel pa- you know [noise] part of this [noise] community so i 

90.38 93.41 B: it really bothered me and really [noise] hurt me when 

93.27 105.88 B: i realized that it [noise] some people i used to work with you know just [noise] passed away because of that and [noise] i mean i had known a bunch of people that you know lost friends and family and i [noise] i mean it was horrible [noise] so 

97.83 98.85 A: yeah 

104.68 105.95 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

106.19 109.03 B: [noise] it's it's been really difficult since then but 

109.31 117.04 B: [noise] they they are okay now but i mean you still don't know what really happened and you don't have all the information yet you know 

117.03 123.38 A: yeah yeah and i i i agree there i'm not really happy with all the wars that have been going on because of it but 

117.86 118.69 B: so 

123.30 124.99 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

123.39 129.01 A: th- not much i can do about that either so [laughter] um 

127.46 132.46 B: yeah but uh what do you think what did you think about uh you know 

132.92 136.56 B: the terrorists and the the war against c- you know terror 

137.08 142.81 A: oh yeah well that's a good thing uh but again i don't like the way they're going about it i mean 

137.16 138.58 B: (( [noise] do you think [noise] )) 

142.87 146.65 A: a lot of innocent people are getting hurt at the same time 

145.87 147.71 B: yeah 

146.76 157.21 A: and that kind of bothers me or i i think about you know whether somebody c- from this country went somewhere and did something and they came over here killing everybody just to find one person [laughter] you know 

152.78 154.96 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

157.00 161.39 B: [noise] yeah [noise] so your moral against the war then 

158.44 159.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

161.51 165.14 A: uh yeah i'm i just don't want the innocent people getting hurt and 

161.76 162.57 B: (( in for )) 

164.53 167.69 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

166.20 167.91 A: i it just it bothers me 

167.84 175.99 B: okay so like what happened with a- in afghanistan you you wouldn't agree that that was the right way to do it okay 

176.24 183.30 A: yeah i don't like the way they did it no i think they should have sent somebody in you know like the secret taskforce or something to take him out 

183.56 193.04 B: oh okay oh the whole point is i mean they did all that but they still didn't find you know bin laden and and what they and what they tried to do i- is [noise] you know to 

184.24 185.53 A: (( i think they would have )) 

186.03 186.75 A: they 

189.37 190.31 A: yeah 

193.18 194.20 B: to 

194.48 206.10 B: you know make the people focus on in iraq after you know and and what in iraq nothing happened you know we didn't find any chemical weapons so far so [noise] what's next you know i mean 

201.01 201.88 A: yeah 

205.11 207.76 A: yeah well they're talking about iran [mn] 

207.74 218.58 B: yeah and that is insane i mean y- you all these guys are doing i mean the government's doing all this stuff you know with our money you know and [laughter] i mean a war is not cheap and you know 

216.91 218.93 A: no definitely not 

218.67 225.94 B: even the economy's really bad so we have afghanistan you know and then we have um iraq and now and now what 

225.99 230.06 B: you know iran that is insane i think completely insane 

228.40 231.53 A: (( yeah i think it is i i think it's totally insane )) 

231.79 235.38 B: (( so i don't know what's going to happen can you hold on a sec )) 

234.49 235.45 A: sure 

235.58 236.83 B: (( [noise] )) 

238.96 242.13 B: (( sorry [noise] okay )) 

243.41 250.11 A: yeah i try i don't follow the i don't follow it too much i try not to get on the political side with it you know because 

243.85 244.79 B: (( hello [noise] )) 

250.32 257.61 A: there are so many different opinions on it some people think that we belong there and a lot of people are like me think they should've went about it a different way 

257.62 260.95 B: yeah 

257.92 259.20 A: (( you know um )) 

260.16 267.56 A: i think it would've been much easier if they'd sent somebody in there and let 'em hang out find out where he is and then just take him out you know 

267.58 268.98 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

269.02 269.96 A: but 

269.19 272.33 B: that would've been much [noise] cheaper too i think [noise] [noise] 

271.27 281.18 A: yeah it would've been cheaper and a lot less a lot of less innocent people would've got hurt and you know and a lot of our our soldiers wouldn't be [laughter] being killed you know 

279.53 280.47 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] ))
