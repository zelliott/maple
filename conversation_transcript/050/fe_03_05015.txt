26.72 27.50 A: uh

32.73 45.37 A: it came on it said something's going on you know we you know obviously and then you know five minutes later pictures started coming in so the announcers weren't sure what was going on if there was a fire or 

45.43 49.29 A: you know then obviously it just progressed to worse and worse [noise] 

46.20 47.14 B: right

67.24 69.16 B: heard what was happening i it was 

69.48 72.94 B: stunning i mean i just could not believe what was happening 

72.59 73.68 A: yeah 

73.08 77.77 B: and of course at that point too nobody knew what was going on 

76.84 81.73 A: right right [noise] well i haven't made that many changes uh 

82.04 85.51 A: in my lifestyle i guess that was never uh 

82.57 83.26 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

85.94 89.97 A: you know for financial reasons or whatever i don't fly that much 

88.34 89.38 B: (( mhm mhm [mn] )) 

89.69 90.71 B: mhm 

90.09 91.36 A: um 

92.01 98.60 A: you know i i've become more interested and more uh curious about what they're going to do about 

98.64 99.72 A: (( um )) 

100.00 103.57 A: you know immigration and th- the borders and the 

103.40 115.55 A: and the uh alerts and what you know justifies an alert and what goes on in the other countries of the bombings and the suicide bombers but as far as actual 

112.85 113.83 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

115.49 118.50 A: you know how has it affected my life oh well you know 

118.65 126.13 A: it i didn't know anybody personally uh you know o- of course you feel for everybody and their families but um 

126.85 130.19 A: you know i i don't know if you really there's much you can 

130.37 132.12 A: you know change you know 

132.06 140.77 B: and that's that's my attitude i i believe somewhat that you can you can take some personal uh uh 

141.18 147.27 B: changes some personal assurances prevention measures but basically we don't know 

147.33 158.27 B: who or when or what is happening in our lives so i mean um i have not flown f- uh since nine eleven because of monetary restrictions too 

158.50 164.03 B: so i don't know what type of security is is going on at airports now um 

164.04 164.71 B: (( [mn] )) 

165.01 171.87 B: i understand that you need to check in much earlier and i i it do- it will not stop me from flying let's say that [noise] 

170.46 183.16 A: [noise] [noise] uh well i'm glad you brought that up because that's now that i think about that has changed a little bit because my wife travels for her job and i had to take her to the airport this past sunday morning 

182.72 184.17 B: (( [sigh] mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

183.27 187.35 A: for uh a flight to california for a week and uh 

187.70 202.01 A: you know it does affect y- you know you got to get there earlier and of course uh you know i walked her in and uh you know there's extra security and extra scanning and you can only go so far now with your [lipsmack] 

198.37 199.41 B: mhm 

202.40 204.37 A: the person you're dropping off 

203.73 204.79 B: (( mhm )) 

204.40 209.63 A: you just don't have access right up to the gate and say goodbye to them as they're about to board 

209.17 210.14 B: yeah 

209.63 220.37 A: you can only go so far and like as i said you gotta get there they used to tell you to get there an hour before now they tell you to get there two hours before [mn] so 

219.31 223.21 B: what type of security clearance did you have to go through 

222.95 225.19 A: right and you know uh 

225.66 226.78 A: (( um )) 

226.64 235.01 B: i mean we used to just go through and they scanned our baggage and i'm sure they had people looking at us that we didn't know about um 

233.61 237.74 A: yeah and i'm sure they got cameras that you don't know and uh 

235.20 236.50 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

236.84 240.68 B: um what type of extra things did you notice 

241.39 245.88 A: uh just more presence more uh you know c- uh 

245.96 256.78 A: cops with uh outside d- directing traffic with guns not just your usual uh security guys you know of a security company uh more real 

250.14 251.34 B: mhm 

254.80 255.81 B: mhm 

257.02 259.89 A: cops and state troopers and uh 

258.22 259.19 B: mhm 

259.79 263.25 B: but you didn't have to like take off your shoes or any of that [noise] 

262.30 267.62 A: no no well i didn't get that far with her again you can't go as far as you used to so uh 

265.05 265.96 B: okay 

266.61 267.75 B: oh okay 

267.65 271.05 A: i only i think you get screened twice now 

270.74 272.33 B: oh okay 

271.43 272.62 A: uh 

272.79 278.30 A: but uh but you can't the person dropping off can't even go past the first screening 

278.24 279.50 B: oh i see 

278.32 280.31 A: (( they don't unless you yeah that's have a ticket )) 

279.92 281.05 B: yeah that's 

281.35 292.81 B: that'll be different now i have um i'd won a cruise and it left from fort lauderdale port everglades and i was not aware of all this 

282.53 283.85 A: yeah so 

292.70 297.69 B: stuff before i went but that is a high risk um 

297.61 298.50 A: sure [noise] 

297.85 303.96 B: area because apparently that's the major um port for for um 

304.05 314.61 B: cruises and uh uh we were on high alert when i left and we were on high alert when i got back i had driven with a relative there 

304.86 305.83 A: right 

314.63 317.64 B: so i didn't fly to get there but um 

317.85 319.28 B: uh i 

319.65 333.33 B: i didn't really notice any extra security for my end you know you're not allowed to go certain areas at certain times well that's true of an airport too but uh i got to do a couple of things i was a little 

328.56 329.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

333.42 338.66 B: surprised that security let me do even not knowing it was a high risk area 

338.27 339.67 A: (( [noise] right )) 

338.78 348.69 B: i had to leave my baggage at a certain point but i mean that's not if i am a terrorist i'm going to find other ways to you know i would expect that 

346.28 347.44 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

348.27 349.89 A: right 

348.74 350.93 B: but i did hear 

351.00 358.23 B: uh later that uh we're the only country that sends divers under the boats and they're checked 

358.35 367.81 B: um uh they're scrutinized for bombs and other types of terrorists' measures before the boat leaves the dock 

364.42 365.35 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

367.78 373.36 B: which i was really amazed to hear and we did go to the bahamas during our trip and 

373.17 383.76 B: i understand that they don't have that much security measures in place and you know if the terrorists wanted to they could [laughter] you know do something there where security is very lax anyway 

383.55 391.77 A: well like you said i think we don't even know half the stuff they are doing and they don't want us to know and it's probably better off we don't know 

387.57 388.77 B: (( [noise] right )) 

389.56 390.68 B: right 

391.69 403.71 A: and uh the the divers under the boats and all that stuff and they don't need to let it out so th- any terrorists know what what's really going on and you know the behind the scenes uh 

394.48 395.64 B: mhm 

400.77 401.71 B: mhm 

403.72 411.66 A: security's probably better than the uh yes you need the the presence to deter the the person thinking about doing something wacky 

411.67 412.98 A: but uh 

412.11 413.07 B: mhm 

413.01 417.74 A: you know it's not uh let them know everything we're doing and uh 

417.78 419.98 A: we're probably better off that way [noise] 

417.97 419.21 B: yeah 

419.31 432.90 B: now i i would object if security were to the point for example we had national i._d.s and some of the things that were proposed because i i don't want to give up my personal freedom to that extent um 

433.26 440.76 B: i think that would be an overreaction i mean a terrorist act can happen any place any time and any way for example 

440.87 443.49 B: the next incident could be on a train 

443.63 444.49 A: right 

443.72 453.60 B: or it could be a bridge destroyed or something and that would you know possibly you know how knows it wouldn't maybe kill as many people but it would be an infrastructure 

453.55 459.35 B: that would uh not uh you know that would delay everything for a long time 

459.44 460.66 B: but uh 

460.74 474.61 B: you know we're we're fortunate the only other terrorist activity that we've had major in recent history is oklahoma city bombing and i i'm curious to see the reaction to that compared to new york 

474.63 476.15 B: city's uh 

476.22 483.98 B: you know to the towers incident because it's almost like we forgot that there was this horrible incident in oklahoma city 

483.66 484.70 A: right 

484.07 486.62 B: which cost many lives too 

486.45 487.35 A: right 

486.71 488.99 B: and that was an inside terrorist 

488.83 489.94 A: right 

489.34 490.35 B: um 

490.38 498.09 B: uh uh but again i i would not stop travelling i'm not any closer to family you know some people really 

498.12 502.57 B: um you know they've they've gotten uh much closer 

502.65 510.22 B: to their family members because they you know you know who's going to be around next week i don't think you can live your life that way [noise] 

509.54 518.42 A: no no the the it's the day goes on and it's uh you know if it's you know not nice to say or not the right way to put it but if 

518.76 521.63 A: if your day is if today's your day 

521.16 522.23 B: mhm 

521.80 526.33 A: be it in a car accident or a terrorist or whatever it is today is your day 

526.08 534.32 B: sounds like we're both existentialist [laughter] yeah i believe that happens uh or is i think that's the way 

528.26 530.65 A: yeah uh you know 

534.31 542.86 B: life is i mean um in other countries like england for example to be in comparison with us they have bombings and they have terrorist acts 

542.97 544.26 B: every week 

543.57 545.15 A: (( [noise] right )) 

544.47 548.98 B: and they have lives lost uh innocent lives lost all the time 

549.10 554.68 B: um and of course you know middle eastern countries experience this almost every day 

554.50 555.57 A: right 

554.96 556.60 B: and uh uh 

557.10 560.54 B: you know the y- you just can't live your life wondering 

560.86 562.63 B: what's going to happen today 

562.91 569.70 A: but if you want protection and you want to feel safer there's going to be from now on some inconveniences 

569.11 570.43 B: (( right yeah )) 

569.72 572.07 A: and you're gonna just gonna have to accept it 

571.04 576.57 B: and i think we probably should be should have been doing those security practices anyway 

576.42 577.44 A: right 

576.82 578.67 B: uh because 

578.99 591.33 B: you know even after oklahoma city we should've um i mean there were all sorts of preventive activities like putting up concrete barriers and closing certain areas to the public entirely and that sort of thing 

591.39 592.37 B: um 

593.37 598.64 B: i d- we saw those here even in the small town that i live in but i haven't seen 

598.67 599.89 B: uh security
