4.47 5.85 B: i'm fine thank you 

5.40 7.05 A: good 

7.21 9.18 A: so airport security 

8.56 10.32 B: airport security 

10.53 17.10 B: [lipsmack] interesting i always uh i'm hearing things in the news and reading things in the paper but i have not flown lately 

15.52 22.52 A: [noise] [noise] i have not flown at all not in the last ten years 

22.24 23.29 B: really 

22.69 24.49 A: yeah so 

24.62 25.82 A: um 

27.01 29.90 A: i'm not sure how the airport se- where where you calling from 

29.81 30.99 B: pennsylvania mhm 

30.51 32.74 A: pennsylvania i'm calling from d._c. 

32.35 33.45 B: okay 

33.01 37.36 A: so i know the um security here in d._c. has been real tight 

36.92 38.69 B: i would think so 

37.38 39.24 A: um 

39.39 43.02 A: so have you flown [noise] you say you have you have have you flown recently 

42.43 46.04 B: i have flown a lot but i have not flown since nine eleven 

45.53 48.37 A: (( oh okay so you would normally catch a train now )) 

48.39 51.52 B: [lipsmack] um no i it it really isn't that i'm 

50.50 52.49 A: [noise] 

51.78 61.24 B: doing something instead we we just aren't travelling as much um i used to live out of state and our family was in pennsylvania and we used to travel a fair amount 

54.98 56.59 A: right right 

60.81 61.84 A: right 

61.20 66.87 B: but um we've relocated back to this area so we just don't do that type of travel as much 

66.30 67.77 A: right right 

66.97 72.62 B: and i'm home with children i i used to um work full time and i used to travel with business so 

73.01 81.87 B: um but i i've heard a number of people talk about how much different it is and how time consuming it is to navigate their way through the airport of late 

80.84 82.11 A: right 

82.36 90.51 A: a lot of times it would took just maybe half an hour now it's taking like three hours i did have a friend that uh actually went to florida and uh 

90.57 98.11 A: he said he waited in line almost three hours um for the security so they they're they're checking everything 

92.88 94.34 B: oh my goodness 

97.71 103.86 B: depending on how far you're flying for a short flight you almost could just rent a car and go [lipsmack] 

99.49 100.40 A: right 

102.88 111.84 A: yeah yeah yeah matter of fact i think um a friend told me that he had to take his shoes off he was actually he was coming back in the country he had gone abroad 

111.12 112.29 B: mhm 

111.94 116.00 A: and um they basically stripped him down shoes everything had to come off 

115.85 123.53 B: i have also heard um my friend in atlanta had a similar problem she said she had very high 

123.54 133.98 B: shoes with like a platform kind of heel and she thought maybe they suspected that there was you know it was hollow with something in it or something because they made her take her shoes off 

125.29 126.34 A: right 

130.51 131.72 A: [laughter] 

131.85 132.75 A: right 

133.42 134.83 A: mhm 

134.25 145.04 B: um i i guess they just have to do these things randomly but i guess the question was specifically do we feel that the security at airports has made us 

137.83 138.81 A: yeah 

145.05 148.12 B: safer from terrorists is that was that what they said 

147.04 155.80 A: that was the question right right um i don't a a lot of people think that it has but a lot of people are still not flying because um 

155.73 163.40 A: there are so many ways you can get things on board you know you could have people actually working on the ground that are involved in any um 

158.39 159.47 B: mhm 

163.43 166.05 A: anything that could happen so 

165.98 167.07 B: true 

167.21 170.62 B: i also heard not too long ago 

170.89 176.59 B: that because they needed to hire additional security personnel so quickly 

176.79 177.75 B: they 

176.98 181.81 A: they're not able to rea- really check their backgrounds yeah [noise] 

179.04 186.00 B: yes they cut some corners and they they had some people working as security personnel that were in fact a security risk 

185.36 186.69 A: right 

186.21 191.44 B: so i guess i'm not confident that it lessens the chance of terrorist 

191.50 199.95 B: so much as i am thinking it's just sort of window dressing that needs to be done to try and make people feel confident 

197.61 208.99 A: [noise] [noise] i think it's to make yeah i think it's to build confidence that they're doing something um but i guess if somebody really wants to do something they can well they've already proven it you know so 

202.41 203.33 B: right 

207.29 208.34 B: mhm 

208.94 214.01 B: then there was a gentleman in philadelphia not long after um nine eleven 

209.35 210.16 A: (( [noise] )) 

214.08 215.01 B: that 

215.21 219.83 B: not meaning any harm but trying to prove a point intentionally 

219.89 222.79 B: carried some sort of weapon 

223.20 226.90 B: onto a plane just to prove to his wife that he could do it 

226.55 227.52 A: [laughter] 

227.66 232.51 B: and he got by i- it wasn't a gun i forget what he had it was not a gun but it was 

230.53 231.51 A: right 

232.69 236.76 B: some sort of a knife or something that could be used as a weapon or something 

236.27 237.40 A: right 

236.73 251.09 B: and um it was a very interesting story apparently the wife wanted to travel by plane and he was insisting it was not safe she said it was he said i'll prove to you that it's not went to the airport and managed to get through the security checks carrying this thing 

248.22 249.19 A: get on 

250.58 261.59 A: well i think a lot of times too you're looking at stereotypes um and 'cause they do random checks and i believe they look for a particular type of person to do their random checks 

253.87 254.96 B: mhm 

259.38 260.40 B: mhm 

261.78 274.18 A: um and i think that- that too right there is not right in a way because they're infringing some people's privacy um when they're letting other people by and again 

265.88 266.64 B: no 

272.45 282.22 B: i agree they're stomping all over civil rights of some groups and on the other hand they're allowing other people who would be criminals of a different ethnic background to just cruise on by 

275.40 276.44 A: right 

278.48 279.04 A: (( [mn] )) 

280.62 281.56 A: right 

281.72 282.91 A: right 

282.35 284.67 B: yeah it's kinda like a double whammy there 

284.06 290.49 A: yeah yeah i think so 'cause uh my friend was he's actually pakistani and he went abroad 

290.57 291.59 A: and he said 

292.40 300.18 A: to get there it took them i mean to get through the airport was four hours to get back into the country was even worse 

297.16 297.95 B: mm 

300.63 302.49 A: okay 'cause he looks 

302.97 305.56 A: again from pakistan he looks 

305.93 310.79 A: like one of the people they would look look for you know so yeah 

307.58 311.64 B: right right they're profiling people with a certain ethnic background 

310.81 312.79 A: exactly so 

313.02 314.75 A: um 

313.06 319.88 B: now what does i'm i'm curious d- does he feel that this is necessary being someone who's targeted more or less 

319.55 333.03 A: well he um he was pretty he was comfortable with it he said whatever they have to do to to check to make sure nobody gets on that plane with something it do- it didn't really matter to him he didn't feel like he was being targeted in any way 

332.51 334.81 B: really he didn't feel offended 

333.11 334.13 A: um 

334.21 339.27 A: right right he said whatever it took uh 'c- 'cause it actually made him feel safer 

336.23 337.45 B: interesting 

339.49 342.66 A: um 'cause that was a long trip and um 

342.98 352.77 A: so i- to him it was fine but i've had other people who say it it was not really necessary um but i think maybe international flights 

344.31 344.97 B: (( mm )) 

352.88 360.08 A: um [noise] uh there's more security risk in international flights versus domestic flights i'm not really sure why 

357.77 358.73 B: right 

360.26 361.21 A: so 

361.81 363.04 A: (( but [noise] [noise] )) 

361.99 369.06 B: but i guess when it comes right down to it i suppose i feel that if a terrorist group or a terroristic person 

369.28 372.69 B: truly is hell bent on accomplishing something 

372.18 373.45 A: right 

373.11 375.37 B: there are ways to do it 

375.19 385.84 A: right right and these people that uh i i mean it's people that's already planted in the u._s. and planted in countries that are actually citizens of these countries now 

376.59 377.62 B: i i don't 

382.44 383.42 B: mhm 

385.50 387.13 B: mhm right 

385.91 395.28 A: you know that and and they just do it i mean look at the guy the the the army guy that shot up his own people you know 

394.07 397.00 B: oh i know oh that was horrible 

395.66 399.28 A: so yeah so you never know 

399.73 401.57 B: and i think when you 

401.65 409.79 B: consider that in some of these instances terrorists are willing to sacrifice their own life 

408.87 410.69 A: own life mhm 

409.84 417.33 B: in order to commit a a terroristic act i think when you se- take that into consideration you aren't going to stop someone 

416.87 418.40 A: right right 

417.72 423.21 B: they if they don't have the self preservation instinct they'll go to any lengths 

422.69 424.89 A: right and and 

424.08 428.94 B: and i don't think we can do anything to stop that no matter how much we tromp on people's civil liberties 

428.69 438.87 A: right 'cause these people believe in in believe in their religion and they believe that they can die for it um basically have been brainwashed far as i i'm concerned 

432.13 433.09 B: mhm 

437.49 438.46 B: mhm 

438.93 447.33 A: um so i i don't know it's uh i don't think it's people are again people are not flying as much as they are they were 

447.44 452.17 A: um they're just afraid to get on airplanes i've had people say they will not get on an airplane 

452.56 460.51 A: um i guess maybe you and myself [laughter] so i prefer to drive um than to take an airplane 

455.39 456.66 B: mhm [laughter] 

460.88 461.80 A: so 

461.02 465.26 B: now did you always or is this since nine eleven you've changed your viewpoint 

464.65 471.16 A: well i i didn't have problems getting on airplanes um but since the nine eleven yes definitely 

467.63 468.49 B: mhm 

470.45 471.39 B: okay 

470.99 481.69 A: um again because i'm of indian background so i i think that if i was to try to get on an airplane i'd probably be profiled out and stripped down myself 

481.45 482.25 B: (( mm )) 

481.88 482.86 A: so 

483.28 493.48 A: um so i don't get on airplanes um last time i went was maybe seven years ago when we went to vegas that was it out of the country i've been in a long time 

490.77 491.75 B: mhm 

494.12 495.05 A: so 

495.08 502.76 B: and i would think even if like in the case of your friend who apparently felt that that made him feel safer 

502.28 509.41 A: right right a lot of people just don't mind the wait uh if it's gonna help but i don't know if it really helps 

504.35 505.26 B: i would 

506.82 508.18 B: right 

509.33 512.45 B: right but i'm wondering um 

512.67 522.67 B: [lipsmack] i have young children and i'm wondering if if i was travelling with them and i was selected as someone to really be investigated and so on 

522.37 523.58 A: right 

523.07 530.94 B: i wonder how upsetting that would be to kids they might find that very upsetting to see their parents being treated like as a potential criminal 

530.45 533.18 A: right right i i would think so too 

532.88 538.86 B: i mean you know i i'm old enough to understand well this is why they're doing this it's a preventive thing but you know 

536.19 538.61 A: right but kids don't mhm 

538.75 541.03 A: kids really don't understand that kind of stuff 

540.31 544.55 B: it would it would definitely put a different spin on the way it was perceived 

543.97 546.62 A: yes yeah i believe so too 

547.32 548.24 A: (( well )) 

548.98 551.75 A: i don't know i don't plan on travelling any time soon 

551.97 563.85 A: um much less getting on an airplane because any i mean not necessarily just airplane also you you're talking trains um normal transportation that they can hit so how safe are you anyway you 

559.42 560.42 B: mhm 

563.40 564.54 B: mhm 

564.03 569.43 A: know and here in the district um i mean they're always on alert but 

569.58 574.15 A: if someone wants to do something they're gonna do it you can't really stop 'em 

574.32 578.15 B: [lipsmack] whether it be someone driving a plane into the pentagon or 

577.21 578.62 A: mhm 

578.37 581.70 B: one individual lunatic being a sniper 

581.25 585.06 A: yeah which we've had so 

581.94 582.99 B: i mean y- 

583.53 586.74 B: exactly and um that you know 

586.99 591.10 B: that's apparently a a local person who just was 

592.13 594.14 B: ill in some way but 

593.25 594.97 A: yeah 

595.10 595.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

595.17 598.59 B: yeah y- you really can't control what everyone else does 

598.32 599.89 A: no you cannot
