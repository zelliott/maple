4.44 6.00 A: this is uh danny 

5.85 7.22 B: hi i'm dwayne [noise] 

7.33 8.46 A: (( nice to meet you dwayne )) 

8.23 10.02 B: thanks uh 

10.29 12.75 B: so september eleventh changes 

12.85 14.18 B: (( uh [sigh] )) 

14.34 24.02 B: uh my wife and i uh we've discussed if something we live in seattle and the space needle was supposedly a target at one point 

20.20 21.72 A: mhm 

24.01 31.67 B: uh we've just decided that if something like that happens here we'll both return home as soon as we can 

25.61 26.31 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

32.29 42.33 B: uh we both work uh at the university of washington and and we thought that might be a more convenient place to meet but it would be more of a target than 

42.58 48.73 B: our home would be we're not worried about it but we thought you know should something go wrong uh home will 

44.10 45.27 A: yeah 

47.71 49.07 A: oh really yeah 

49.13 50.43 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

50.56 59.10 A: [noise] well i i live in los angeles so i mean th- things are a lot different over here 'cause uh you know there's there's always you know threats and you know [noise] 

52.92 53.82 B: yeah 

58.84 59.78 B: uh-huh 

59.02 72.07 A: from from people and and whatnot but you know that's that's just something i i guess i got to do it because of you know i chose t- to live over here but [noise] um you know it's [noise] it's it's really [noise] it's kind of uh 

72.08 77.45 A: i don't know like played out i guess yo- you could say because uh you know there's there's always so many [noise] 

77.38 91.72 A: so many threats or you know so much s- so much stuff going on in the news down there that it's just like you know there's there's too many people you know calling a bluff and [noise] you know it's just like i think i think it's it's kinda like the boy who call- or the the boy who cried wolf is 

85.96 86.97 B: right 

91.55 96.21 A: is basically what's happening over here is there's so many so many threats after the attacks that 

96.22 104.33 A: you know that people are just kinda blowing 'em off now which is which is kind of aggravating in a way because you know you never know when one of those will come true 

103.03 104.12 B: right 

104.46 115.34 A: but you know i guess i guess a- the the main thing or the only thing you can do is just just keep being cautious and you know just just you never know what's going to happen i guess [noise] 

111.15 112.03 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

114.35 117.36 B: yeah [sigh] no we 

117.59 126.45 B: we don't think that we treat people any differently um like it's a really diverse group up here i'm sure it's just as diverse down in l. a. 

126.79 132.89 B: um but we do watch for vehicles that don't have license plates or 

133.38 141.24 B: uh you know just something that looks peculiar that maybe we hadn't noticed before i think we're a little more aware of now 

141.25 151.11 B: we still don't necessarily act on anything you know we i saw a car without any license plates yesterday and i didn't call nine one one to let them know but 

141.40 142.24 A: [noise] 

150.41 151.71 A: huh oh really 

151.49 153.56 B: um yeah it's 

153.64 157.14 B: uh periodically there's a car maybe they're 

157.25 162.63 B: uh maybe it's a newly purchased car and their sticker has fallen out of the window or or whatever 

162.50 163.70 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

163.25 164.30 B: um 

164.40 171.23 B: but yeah it's i don't think we've really changed very much actual lifestyle 

171.68 186.50 A: yeah i agree um over in over in seattle you guys have like uh when you go to like i don't [noise] i don't know if there's any main like theme parks or any stuff like that where like they have checkpoints where they check all the cars and stuff like that are they still they still doing that over there or [noise] 

183.69 184.57 B: (( no )) 

186.07 189.97 B: um at the airport they are that's really the only place 

190.42 193.75 B: where it's practical to do it but they 

190.58 191.71 A: (( 'cause i [noise] )) 

193.87 196.35 B: the highway runs 

197.14 198.78 B: (( uh let's see )) 

198.88 207.94 B: sea-tac airport's about half an hour south of here and you get off the freeway and drive about five miles and then there's a road that only goes to the airport 

207.91 215.19 B: and on that road they've got a blockade set up and so yeah i guess we we flew 

215.41 225.79 B: in february and we made sure that we went an hour early like you're supposed to i mean normally we'd only go half an hour or fifteen minutes early 

225.91 228.90 B: but so i guess in that way we have 

229.26 231.90 B: changed how we how we fly 

231.14 235.92 A: (( huh )) 

232.45 236.27 B: um but that's the only place that they're doing checkpoints 

236.27 244.30 A: [noise] yeah yeah down here well i work at at universal studios so i down here i mean they're still doing that like all over the place [noise] i mean if you go to like [noise] 

239.27 240.68 B: oh yeah 

244.49 245.21 A: you know a 

245.19 249.45 A: a big movie theatre in l. a. or you know any place that has a parking garage pretty much they're 

249.44 260.69 A: they're pretty much going to stop you and they'll they'll put a mirror under your car still and and you know make sure that you're you're safe and you're good to go but yeah they're they're still really cautious about that which is which is not a bad thing it's just 

250.88 251.85 B: really 

259.79 261.46 B: no no 

260.74 271.81 A: it's just it's not at all uh the only thing that's kind of weird about it is is is that they feel they still need to do that you know it's just kind of like if they if maybe if they stop doing that it would give us more security or 

266.29 267.47 B: right 

271.84 284.58 A: or 'cause because people still wonder you know they wonder if it's necessary and you know because i mean they they do do a lot down here to to uh to make sure that [noise] you know that things are things are going good obviously so 

275.05 276.01 B: uh-huh 

283.68 285.01 B: right 

284.79 285.77 A: (( [noise] )) 

285.38 287.24 B: now that's interesting um 

287.37 292.53 B: the like the checkpoint here at the airport uh they just kind of wave you through unless 

292.79 302.13 B: they really have a suspicion like i've i've been to the airport probably five times in the last three months four months 

295.17 296.17 A: (( yeah )) 

302.11 303.66 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

302.21 307.41 B: and and every time they just waved me right through um you don't even stop your car 

307.86 315.33 B: uh so it's and like at a movie theatre there's or a a large parking garage there's no check whatsoever 

308.11 308.82 A: (( [laughter] )) 

315.59 320.92 B: and you know the rest of the world's dealt with stuff like this for a long time i mean israel 

321.07 329.05 B: they're old pros at uh watching for terrorism and northern ireland et cetera you know they really 

325.18 326.41 A: oh yeah 

329.18 332.59 B: have learned their lessons and we're just now 

332.82 336.38 B: beginning to figure out oh yeah it could happen to us 

336.71 337.75 B: um 

337.84 344.31 B: so i i don't feel that it's a big inconvenience uh if they would stop me at the airport or if there were more 

344.69 347.29 B: uh checkpoints here it's 

347.33 351.17 B: it's a small price i think to pay to feel more secure 

351.15 352.10 A: yeah 

351.49 358.90 B: uh and largely i think that's all it is is a feeling of security a- and i don't feel really insecure as it is 

359.05 364.68 B: but there would definitely be a deterrent from somebody doing something hazardous 

364.97 369.11 A: [noise] yeah especially for like all the [noise] tourists and stuff that come down here you know they don't expect 

368.30 369.67 B: right 

369.08 377.68 A: that 'cause you know in in their home town that's probably all cleared away but they come down here and you know they're they're getting stopped and and stuff like that some of them 

372.20 373.59 B: right 

377.65 387.65 A: i've i've seen a lot of them will question you know why are you guys still doing this you know and then and other people other people really respect it and appreciate but you know then there's that that few 

380.97 381.80 B: (( mhm )) 

384.29 385.35 B: yeah 

387.74 393.18 A: that just like you know that they get annoyed by it almost which is kind of weird [noise] mhm 

391.33 392.96 B: right 

393.13 403.41 B: yeah there's always going to be people that aren't aren't willing to submit to a search or aren't willing to stop and wait three seconds for a a quick check 

403.38 404.17 A: (( [noise] )) 

403.66 409.38 B: but that i mean that's human nature to think well it'll never happen to me 

409.62 411.95 B: so i don't need to worry about it 

411.52 413.66 A: yeah really [noise] 

412.46 413.36 B: so 

413.62 417.54 B: i guess another thing we've done uh we've begun 

418.00 425.80 B: uh just storing some non perishable food at our home in case something happened and we weren't able to do shopping or whatever 

426.28 427.27 B: (( uh )) 

426.38 426.94 A: (( [mn] )) 

428.14 429.08 B: it's 

429.31 431.78 B: we don't have a lot of food stashed away 

431.82 439.34 B: but we also like to camp a lot and so we just make sure that all of our camping food and all of our like camp stove fuel 

439.48 440.91 B: stuff like that's 

441.04 445.25 B: in order in case we had to live out of our apartment for a couple of weeks or 

443.39 446.69 A: (( huh [noise] [noise] left at home )) 

446.07 447.41 B: yeah 

447.79 451.51 A: you guys uh do people like sell gas masks on the street and stuff over there 

450.90 458.07 B: no no we never saw anything like that going even back in the real september eleventh 

458.16 466.29 B: uh time nothing really major was going on here the even at the space needle uh they did cancel 

466.32 472.04 B: like somebody had reserved the whole space needle for a big party and they cancelled that party 

472.39 473.48 B: um 

472.47 474.26 A: [noise] oh really 

473.68 485.84 B: yeah and they had previously like for the millennium new year's uh same thing then somebody had reserved the whole restaurant for a huge party 

486.09 490.94 B: and they cancelled that based on some intelligence from somewhere 

491.27 492.96 B: that there might be a 

492.97 494.37 B: a bomb attempt 

494.86 504.44 B: uh so that wasn't really new for september eleventh but uh it definitely impacted those people that had planned on being there 

504.60 507.12 B: and but people still went downtown 

504.85 505.41 A: (( [noise] )) 

507.13 508.33 B: it was 

508.91 509.93 B: uh 

510.17 513.09 B: the streets were still crowded and and people still 

513.58 515.34 B: went out and did their stuff 

515.83 516.84 B: um 

515.96 516.65 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

516.85 525.35 B: [lipsmack] i think sars uh we've got a very large asian population here and i think sars is more a concern for people right now than 

525.41 527.61 B: hijackings or bombings or 

527.73 529.55 B: any terrorism 

528.38 532.39 A: mm [noise] yeah [noise] things have just switched over pretty much 

531.70 533.86 B: right yeah 

533.11 540.68 A: you do you think that uh like since september eleventh or actually when september eleventh happened like uh a lot of people 

540.61 551.86 A: you know doubted our authorities or our government and you know wondered why such a thing could you know could happen was allowed to happen do you do you still think that about our government or do you think that that kind of woke them up or 

545.27 546.19 B: uh-huh 

551.96 558.52 B: uh yes and no i think it woke up some people but i think many people 

558.67 562.03 B: were already aware already concerned 

562.26 565.42 B: and uh they 

565.46 571.25 B: they maybe now get more attention from the government [noise] but i don't know 

568.76 569.76 A: (( yeah i )) 

571.46 575.45 B: how much effort is being made to 

575.88 577.69 B: to keep on top of things 

577.59 584.61 A: guess i guess what i'm saying is like um if there was going to be another attack do you think do you think the government wo- would be ready or 

584.72 589.72 A: because if something like that can slip through you know so easily like that 

585.10 586.60 B: yeah 

587.45 588.51 B: (( yeah i )) 

589.21 596.84 B: i think they would uh i i think attack is definitely possible i i don't think that we would necessarily avert the danger 

597.28 599.82 B: uh conceivably we would
