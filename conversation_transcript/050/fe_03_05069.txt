0.69 3.30 B: (( yes my name is jason ruff )) 

3.66 6.15 A: hi uh simon jones 

6.07 7.03 B: hi 

7.00 8.22 A: how's it going 

7.87 10.03 B: uh pretty good how about yourself 

10.29 11.54 A: can't complain 

11.92 12.98 A: um 

13.33 15.55 A: (( i haven't done this before but )) 

15.18 17.07 B: i've never done it before either 

16.82 19.35 A: [laughter] well that makes two of us 

18.68 19.91 B: [laughter] 

21.13 25.00 A: so um i guess we're talking about um 

24.68 26.18 B: salaries of prof 

25.16 26.05 A: (( strikes )) 

26.38 30.34 A: and professional athletes and salary issues 

29.81 31.52 B: yes that's uh that's true 

31.46 32.31 A: okay 

32.56 33.71 A: um 

33.82 35.62 A: make sure we're in the same picture 

36.26 37.24 A: so 

36.43 37.04 B: (( yeah )) 

38.14 40.26 A: [lipsmack] what's your uh 

40.36 42.50 A: what's your initial idea about them 

40.39 41.89 B: well 

42.40 55.76 B: uh uh my opinion is i think it's gotten ridiculous now that uh a player making fourteen million dollars a year while uh people in all other professions don't make anywhere near that i think is act- totally uh 

55.58 61.10 B: asinine ridicul- i can't even think of enough words uh to describe how bad i think it is 

61.11 62.67 B: and i'm a sports fan 

62.62 66.15 A: yeah i i agree um 

66.78 75.11 A: 'specially in say hockey where um the the teams are pretty much hockey and baseball the teams are pretty much um 

75.51 77.74 A: going bankrupt because of it 

77.76 80.86 A: (( or on the fact they can't put any fans in the seats )) 

80.91 87.48 B: even if you take baseball i mean it's ridiculous you have baseball players making ten to fourteen dollars a year and uh 

87.57 94.23 B: some of them are just mediocre play- mediocre players at baseball right now are making a a minimum of a million dollars a year 

94.27 97.12 A: yeah that's um kind of ridiculous 

97.30 109.26 B: and that's just and they they don't even have to perform because they're getting that money before they uh they perform you know before you see what their performance is so they could either get injured uh after they get their money or they could uh 

97.46 98.34 A: (( i mean )) 

109.14 120.76 B: uh put have a lousy season and uh still collect the money i mean there's n- no rhyme or reason connected to it it's not based on uh the productivity of the uh of the athlete 

120.59 122.48 A: yeah but um 

123.05 130.51 A: you know where are our salaries based on that as well i don't know maybe you're in sales but um 

133.19 140.80 A: i don't think if someone is injured playing a game that they should forfeit their salary in any way 

140.54 152.15 B: oh no i didn't mean that no if they're injured i don't think they should forfeit their salary either what i'm saying is basically um uh everybody's getting the same amount of money no matter what they do you know as far as uh 

152.02 165.54 B: uh productivity you mean you could have a guy that they sign uh- they sign to a five year contract that at ten million dollars a year because of past performance but not instead of waiting to see what he could do 

159.82 160.57 A: yeah 

165.74 171.93 B: i don't know how how uh fairness would go into that but you know 'cause obviously you can't wait to see what he 

172.00 174.75 B: what he can do and also a guy could have a bad year 

175.02 177.00 A: yeah i 

175.72 183.11 B: but there's no incentive for a player to do well because uh he's going to get the same amount of money whether he do- does well or he does very poorly 

183.91 191.62 A: mean okay um yeah i think definitely having incentives built into it is important 

192.01 196.09 B: i don't know about hockey because i'm not a hockey fan you said you are a hockey fan 

192.11 193.05 A: um 

196.05 199.63 A: yeah that's my favorite sport um 

198.34 202.60 B: uh are the salaries in hockey uh out of whack also or 

202.91 207.06 A: well they pretty much top off around ten million dollars 

207.30 208.65 A: so uh 

207.36 209.09 B: that's pretty that's pretty high 

209.39 212.61 A: (( yeah ten million dollars for )) 

213.09 214.65 A: eighty two games 

216.08 220.68 A: um that's that's what peter forsberg's getting um 

221.31 225.07 A: and he's um probably the highest paid player 

225.41 228.24 A: actually i think jaromir jagr is now but um 

229.04 239.33 A: they're two of the highest players players play paid players earning about ten million dollars um but you know most 

239.40 243.25 A: the it's pretty much in hockey it's like a 

244.00 249.37 A: third of the teams can afford several um 

247.63 248.70 B: (( [noise] )) 

249.70 252.37 A: (( you know of that caliber player )) 

252.39 255.77 A: and then a third of them have maybe one or two 

256.70 258.89 A: and then um 

259.34 264.43 A: a third of them w- will never have one of them on their team so 

264.30 267.49 B: (( what team do you are you do you prefer in hockey )) 

264.72 265.41 A: (( like )) 

267.54 269.41 A: uh i'm an avs fan 

270.11 272.87 B: i'm sorry oh an- okay 

270.34 271.96 A: colorado avalanche 

272.98 274.11 A: um 

274.83 278.49 A: i live in colorado i live in denver so it's um 

279.20 280.83 A: it's pretty huge here 

280.52 287.16 B: yeah that's where my sister used to live she just moved from uh denver to uh uh phoenix arizona 

287.19 288.05 A: okay 

287.91 291.49 B: but she had been living in denver for oh over ten years 

291.96 295.44 A: yeah where are you where are you living 

292.65 294.06 B: yeah it's a nice 

295.09 301.55 B: uh i'm living in new jersey right now but uh i have gone to school out in texas i have gone to university of texas 

301.63 302.52 A: okay 

302.30 306.81 B: so i have been living out west for a long time i i i loved it out there 

306.92 308.57 A: yeah 

308.60 314.93 A: well um the one of the reasons i bought up hockey is they're about to have a 

314.87 325.22 A: um i think next seas- after next season the players' contract expires with the the owners so they're going to have a 

325.47 334.64 A: a lock out or at least everyone's been saying they're going to have a lock out and renegotiation and no ones betting on um 

329.88 332.77 B: (( mhm )) 

335.42 338.15 A: on there actually being a season 

338.75 340.22 A: so um 

340.55 344.61 A: i know that happened a little while ago in in baseball didn't it 

343.56 346.91 B: yes it did it happened in baseball didn't work out too well uh 

346.98 350.38 B: as far as that one did i say i'm curious about hockey though 

350.33 362.51 B: it doesn't really um as far as from what i i understand i don't understand that much about hockey uh it doesn't really matter what the teams do during the year it's just the um uh the uh 

362.76 364.05 A: play offs 

363.45 367.78 B: yeah the play offs that count is that correct or is that uh not correct 

368.19 369.28 A: um 

369.67 374.55 A: i don't know i i like watching every single game i 

374.68 379.21 A: i don't care if it's play offs or or regular season it's just it's 

379.52 382.22 B: you just like the games watching the games 

380.98 387.19 A: yeah the the um play offs just obviously are just a big step up but it's um 

387.49 393.33 A: because you can get eliminated and lose in the first round like the avs did this season 

393.41 394.60 A: um 

396.16 398.48 A: [lipsmack] and it does i guess it doesn't really matter 

398.63 402.09 A: um where you finis- finish in the regular season 

402.42 405.55 A: as long as you finish in the top 

404.98 407.40 B: yeah that's what that's what i meant to to say 

405.59 407.53 A: (( you know the top half of the league )) 

408.27 409.90 A: yeah so 

408.98 412.87 B: my kids are interested in in hockey that's the big uh sport right now 

412.82 426.42 B: for kids in high school up here but when when i had gone to uh high school here uh they didn't even have hockey believe it or not that was not one of the uh one of the big sports where right now it's probably one of the larger sports 

421.01 421.75 A: yeah 

426.32 428.86 B: everywhere in this area as well 

428.79 435.03 A: yeah well it's i think it's grown too quickly um 

435.34 442.40 A: 'cause i mean it expanded from i think twenty five teams to thirty teams in two or three years 

439.63 442.81 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] that's a pretty big expansion 

443.03 446.59 A: yeah and um 

443.52 444.58 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

447.22 458.08 A: and now place places like buffalo uh buffalo philadelphia that's not not philadelphia pittsburgh are pretty much bankrupt um 

459.05 462.42 A: about five teams are are almost in the tank 

463.65 465.84 A: at the moment um 

464.56 466.35 B: (( [noise] )) 

468.48 474.70 A: the devils aren't there new jersey devils aren't one of them they're ones that they're league teams but 

471.83 475.32 B: [noise] no uh new jersey devils are never that good [laughter] 

476.09 479.72 A: they're in the stanley cup um finals 

479.12 484.77 B: yeah they sure they are but uh usually it's uh it's not a very strong team 

484.66 485.83 A: oh i 

486.29 487.12 A: okay 

487.06 495.54 B: no i i i'm uh you know i don't like i say i'm not an expert by any means i don't follow hockey very much at all i'm more of a baseball fan 

494.07 494.93 A: yeah 

495.62 498.93 B: so you would know more about it than i would 

495.77 496.57 A: okay 

498.10 502.91 A: yeah the the devils i'd say are one of the best teams in the eastern conference 

502.34 505.18 B: oh see i was wrong they are one of the better teams 

505.04 509.32 A: yeah uh like the rockies are one of the west is uh in 

509.83 516.23 A: [sigh] in this side of uh this side of baseball [sigh] i don't really follow them but um [lipsmack] 

517.61 521.31 A: the avs and the devils are pretty pretty even teams 

521.86 524.12 A: (( at the top of their games i think )) 

524.65 525.52 A: so 

527.03 528.13 A: i don't know 

528.29 529.45 A: um 

530.22 533.71 B: [noise] but getting back to the salary structure how would you uh 

534.01 535.12 B: uh 

535.22 541.20 B: how what kind of structure would you think would be the [noise] best way to do that as far as any sport goes 

541.20 547.14 A: um well i think you need a base salary um just because 

547.50 555.73 A: you never know if someone's going to get injured and just uh you know spend the rest of the season in a wheelchair or something 

556.10 557.24 A: um 

557.68 563.58 A: but then i would say that above that you need to have um 

565.01 567.27 A: some kind of incentive system 

568.25 573.27 A: but if it's it would be hard to do without having um 

575.54 578.48 A: you know being able to acknowledge the players around you 

578.66 586.23 A: that's the that's the problem i have with the uh incentive system because i mean you have people that are 

586.42 589.40 A: superstars but on a really bad team 

589.78 593.76 B: what's the avera- what's the average hockey uh hockey salary you 

590.19 590.96 A: (( um )) 

594.13 598.76 B: know for an average uh not a not a superstar but for an average player 

599.13 599.89 A: i would
