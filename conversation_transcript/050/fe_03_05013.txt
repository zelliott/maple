51.09 63.26 A: i got to where i golf in and they had told me that a plane uh flew into the one of the world trade center buildings and you know everyone thought it was just an accident we were wondering how that happened 

58.66 59.67 B: mhm 

62.61 63.66 B: right 

63.50 72.63 A: and then i teed off and then someone we were on like the fifth or sixth hole and some someone came and told us what had happened 

72.17 73.14 B: wow 

72.88 78.59 A: and uh it was quite a shock but now they want to know if we've made any changes in our lifestyle 

78.38 80.09 B: right have you have you

99.73 100.85 B: mhm 

99.81 106.24 A: and we were a little scared of that uh so we that's the only time we've flown is when we went to disneyworld 

105.84 106.76 B: mhm 

106.63 110.79 A: and uh [noise] you know the s- the security and everything is just scary 

110.94 114.07 A: with the how they handle everything but they do a good job 

114.24 123.76 A: but all in all i would say we really haven't changed our lifestyle you know we're concerned but uh we continue to just plod along like we always have 

119.60 120.56 B: right 

123.46 125.81 B: and i'm retired also 

125.86 126.84 B: uh 

127.40 136.98 B: and i have travelled since then i have not travelled by plane simply because i can't afford it but i have um been to fort lauderdale 

132.97 133.95 A: uh-huh [noise] oh 

136.94 148.07 B: since uh it happened my uh relative and i drove there her child her adult child and grandchild live there and i went on a cruise and um 

149.16 155.03 B: fort lauderdale of course is one of the high risk areas and they had an orange alert that day 

152.58 153.64 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

155.27 169.16 B: um that i was leaving and coming back um i wasn't particularly concerned quite frankly because i uh i i don't believe you can that much to prevent a terrorist act 

168.58 172.72 A: no that's right you know all the security that they're doing uh 

169.37 170.59 B: (( i mean it was [noise] )) 

172.64 173.69 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

172.84 178.06 A: you know i'm sure it's going to it's going to make them think and work a little harder but if they want to do something they still 

177.47 179.12 B: right and i 

178.73 179.47 A: (( can )) 

179.31 180.23 B: (( oh )) 

180.39 193.35 B: i'm not a terrorist certainly but uh i was amazed at some of the things that i was able to do while i was in the port i got into areas that 

193.36 195.72 B: i thought i wouldn't be able to 

195.57 196.83 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

195.89 205.73 B: um of course they do take your your baggage and and hold of it certain areas but i mean if you're skilled at what you do you know how to get around that 

205.11 206.67 A: oh sure [noise] 

206.07 207.18 B: (( and um )) 

207.07 213.42 B: what i was interested in knowing is uh and i didn't realize this ahead of time either i didn't know 

213.27 222.98 B: that that uh port everglades was such a high risk area but there are divers go and check the boats before they leave the the dock 

221.46 222.65 A: (( oh yeah )) 

223.15 225.84 B: and we're the only country that does that 

226.14 229.11 B: and uh we went to the bahamas 

229.22 239.50 B: and uh you know hoo there's nothing there no security of any kind and so if anybody had wanted to attach the boat at that point it would've been a simple 

232.46 233.61 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

239.31 240.32 A: oh sure [noise] 

239.73 242.42 B: thing to do but um again 

244.39 247.97 B: uh i don't think that you can prevent 

248.04 248.91 A: (( [noise] no )) 

248.12 249.75 B: too much from happening 

249.61 250.91 A: no i don't either 

250.50 252.53 B: and i i i 

252.75 254.05 B: i'm uh 

254.32 256.64 B: um i love to fly 

256.37 257.35 A: mhm 

256.72 260.77 B: and it would not stop me from flying i i haven't flown since 

260.94 263.64 B: uh september eleventh but i um 

263.67 266.84 B: understand there are more security checks to go through 

265.45 267.91 A: oh it's unbelievable it's unbelievable 

267.12 268.09 B: (( and [noise] [noise] )) 

268.34 271.84 A: uh they i mean you take your shoes of uh you 

271.03 272.23 B: really 

271.86 274.10 A: oh you get thoroughly searched 

273.82 274.89 B: wow 

274.41 277.46 A: uh a very high security very high security 

276.26 279.40 B: [sigh] i- are you an international airport 

279.28 280.39 A: yes we are 

280.06 284.63 B: yeah see i would be leaving probably through lambert airport in saint louis which is 

284.06 284.78 A: (( uh-huh i'm )) 

284.72 292.69 B: you know a major airport too although it's not at all like like uh o'hare or some of the other larger airports 

291.23 296.65 A: i'm very i'm very surprised that nothing else has happened since then i really am 

295.82 297.28 B: right and 

296.74 300.99 A: uh i i feel very uh sure that something's going to happen 

301.08 301.91 B: yes 

301.31 303.37 A: i thought it would've happened by now 

303.50 312.53 A: and i i made the statement that after september eleventh i just felt that my kids and grandkids would never 

312.67 318.38 A: have the the kind of life that we had that things would change a little more drastically than what they have 

316.17 317.31 B: (( [sigh] mhm )) 

318.26 319.13 B: mhm 

318.57 323.14 A: they really haven't changed that much now i think everybody's getting a little lax again i don't know 

323.46 336.74 B: that's i i agree with that um although i think that we should be able to just go on and live our lives again 'cause we don't know what's going to happen it could be a bridge the next time or it could be a train or it could be 

323.75 324.60 A: (( mm yeah )) 

333.02 333.77 A: (( yeah )) 

336.65 341.21 B: uh you know some type of military installation and um 

341.92 343.37 B: we don't know 

344.00 351.77 B: and i understand in in reading and following the internet news and all that we possibly have thwarted some 

352.03 353.35 B: attacks 

353.28 354.63 A: oh i'm sure we have that's 

353.55 355.27 B: but and uh 

355.71 359.90 B: but we don't we don't even have any details about what those might have been 

360.72 363.30 A: right but i'm sure it's going there's going to be more 

363.05 363.99 B: yes 

363.40 366.11 A: and um i'm sure the next one will be worse 

365.81 370.31 B: right well now the that the terrorists have been successful here 

369.92 370.94 A: (( oh sure )) 

370.66 371.67 B: um 

372.02 373.43 B: they know they can 

373.54 378.60 B: do it but you know other countries have experienced this for centuries 

378.45 379.76 A: (( right right )) 

378.87 382.35 B: so we're fortunate that it hasn't happened here before 

381.81 383.97 A: right and i think um 

384.06 388.53 A: i don't know if you're a republican or not but i think bush has done a tremendous job 

388.39 391.74 B: yeah i'm not um and i do have 

389.38 390.25 A: (( and uh )) 

390.34 402.65 A: i'm sure glad that al gore wasn't in there when this happened you know [laughter] but i guess [laughter] i'm like i see it i i don't know well maybe you like al gore i don't know but i really think bush has done a tremendous job 

393.69 394.91 B: mhm 

402.41 408.13 B: yeah i don't particularly care for him either but [laughter] yeah this was a tough election 

402.89 403.95 A: through all of this 

407.91 408.99 A: oh sure 

408.50 418.39 B: for me um but um i i was very concerned at the point that they were talking about national i._d.s and so and giving up personal freedoms 

417.88 418.95 A: mhm 

418.34 426.20 B: for the sake of security i think what's been handled uh or the way it's been handled so far has been somewhat acceptable 

426.26 430.54 B: again i haven't flown but i don't want to uh 

430.75 434.09 B: you know have to give up all of my personal 

434.16 441.28 B: freedoms um just because uh you know there's something we can't control that's happening 

440.75 447.29 A: yeah yeah that's right right i don't think it'll ever get to that point but i i think things will never be the way they were 

447.19 448.07 B: right 

447.45 450.85 A: and i i think after another terrorist attack 

451.22 457.48 A: if it if it would be a- worse than september eleven i think then there really would be some changes you know 

454.36 455.33 B: mhm 

457.16 458.26 B: um 

458.40 461.03 B: yeah i i i yeah 

461.52 465.91 B: although that was so tr- so traumatic it's hard to imagine what could be 

466.20 467.69 B: more difficult 

467.08 468.85 A: yeah for sure for sure 

468.30 469.52 B: i um 

469.95 475.98 B: i have relatives that lived in the east coast and i visited new york city several times and 

476.07 481.32 B: w- when i was younger i visited that area before the t- towers were built 

481.00 481.90 A: mhm 

481.41 488.83 B: and then i visited the area after the towers were built and it was just so hard for me to conceive that they're not there now 

484.32 485.45 A: mhm 

488.01 489.64 A: oh yeah 

489.10 490.91 B: it was just amazing i- 

490.62 492.95 A: yeah i it's uh 

492.96 495.42 A: when you see an old movie or something now 

495.77 500.26 A: that has them on you think oh my god you know it's gone now 

498.89 499.99 B: mhm 

500.39 505.44 A: [noise] um hard i can't believe that the buildings came down i really can't um 

504.54 516.49 B: mhm i didn't i couldn't either i i understood the damages and the loss of life and that but i it just [laughter] just it was such a shock when they collapsed 

512.37 514.32 A: [noise] yeah it just was worse than 

515.87 519.39 A: it shouldn't have been that bad [noise] you know and uh i think 

517.50 518.45 B: no 

519.51 532.37 A: i- buildings that are built that large now and that tall i think there'll there'll be a little more effort put in at [noise] that they wouldn't come down on such an occasion like that i don't think the terrorists thought they would come down either no 

527.49 529.63 B: mhm mhm 

531.77 537.55 B: i don't know you know we don't know what they were planning but you know then we i think about oklahoma city 

537.18 538.77 A: (( yeah oh yeah yeah )) 

538.02 542.38 B: and uh you know tha- i i- i- it's it's really interesting 

542.73 548.58 B: to see the comparison between the cities like new york city course that was a a a 

546.22 547.10 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

549.16 551.19 B: [noise] [noise] you know an extremely 

551.31 554.22 B: um tragic situation 

553.45 565.23 A: oh when that happened oklahoma city i was i was leaving for oklahoma city the next day we had a meeting scheduled there and and the meeting it was it was a big meeting and it was called off you know 

560.55 561.56 B: wow 

564.73 565.77 B: mhm 

565.35 572.74 A: so i could've been i could've got to see that i never have seen i've never been back to new york since it happened 

572.12 573.07 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

572.95 577.72 A: but i've been on we've been on the world trade center on top of it and 

577.01 577.89 B: uh-huh 

577.81 579.24 A: can't believe they're gone 

579.15 585.88 B: yeah it's just so amazing and i have uh relatives that live within the uh shock area 

586.17 591.77 B: and uh they didn't know what was happening of course at the point that it did happen 

589.23 590.12 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

591.81 593.17 B: and uh they 

593.22 597.40 B: they weren't injured but they did have a lot of damage to their
