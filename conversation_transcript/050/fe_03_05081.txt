21.01 24.25 B: l._a. very cool so our topic is uh 

24.37 29.24 B: whether our airport security truly does indeed in fact reduce the possibilities of 

29.90 30.87 B: future 

30.91 31.99 B: terrorists 

32.07 35.96 B: attacks i suppose i don't know i think it definitely contributes 

36.27 37.75 B: (( on on the po- )) 

37.09 40.50 A: ((  )) 

40.29 43.72 B: lessening the chance absolutely i think there's 

42.21 49.16 A: ((  )) 

44.44 46.28 B: what's that 

49.25 52.87 A: (( fact that we really didn't have some of the instituted procedures that we do now and ))

54.45 64.99 A: ((  )) 

65.64 67.44 A: (( through the the damn terminal as ))

79.02 79.99 B: (( chances ))

84.91 86.05 B: (( going to be )) 

87.97 90.38 B: (( before and after )) 

90.75 91.64 B: (( and )) 

93.52 95.56 B: (( answering a few )) 

99.09 99.89 A: right 

100.21 107.14 B: [mn] basic questions and that's it so in that respect i think it's it's been some form of a of a positive 

107.18 111.12 A: that's true i c- i can see your point there but 

107.22 108.24 B: positive 

111.22 117.17 A: um wouldn't you agree that if someone determined to um 

117.23 123.74 A: break a particular system whether it's um you know attacking airplane or assassinating the world leader 

123.96 124.89 A: um 

124.98 126.91 A: there is 

127.70 130.70 A: not much you can do to um 

131.34 133.72 A: really stop a determined person 

133.96 137.67 A: um if if someone wanted to kill the president then 

134.06 134.88 B: sure 

137.99 147.34 A: you know you could just you know as long as they're willing to give their own life there's many opportunities to do that um if somebody wanted to get on into an airplane 

144.24 146.26 B: true true absolutely 

147.38 155.54 A: you know you could always study the system find the weakest airport in america and just go and uh and try and get through 

155.87 161.41 B: sure absolutely definitely it's definitely true but when you think about it if you're they're willing to uh 

161.45 166.04 B: give their own life there's really no consequences to prevent them from 

165.38 167.88 A: (( that's right )) 

166.19 170.05 B: to deter them from pursuing their uh their mission there 

169.29 175.06 A: yeah any kind of any kind of deterrents you add after the fact is really kind of laughable at that point 

173.91 176.40 B: yeah it really is it really is 

176.43 181.59 B: it's that's definitely a good point yeah you know i mean again i i i think after september eleventh though i mean it's 

176.60 177.62 A: so 

182.07 193.52 B: it's been taken very seriously i mean they as i said there's been you really haven't seen too much on a home front as opposed to where you're saying a lot of statements if you if you can go as far as to call them that have been a lot of the incidents have been overseas 

193.93 199.71 B: uh which you know uh still persist and prevail and i you know it's i i definitely don't think in 

197.02 198.33 A: right 

199.71 210.68 B: with regards to you know we're staying away from the airport here i think a lot of the attacks should they occur god forbid are certainly not gonna be through the same means as you know through the use of an airplane or anything like that i think it's gonna go through some n- 

210.68 222.64 B: non conventional and alternate means of of going about it at this point just the fact of you know bringing some glory i suppose if you know if you can call it that to uh 

214.52 216.91 A: right right 

221.48 230.57 A: yeah that may it may be due more to the um raising the profile of this particular type of attack and people are more aware that they might happen 

230.65 234.65 A: rather than the rather than the uh airport precautions themselves 

234.76 236.47 B: yeah 

235.06 245.93 A: since the airport precautions themselves are more to make americans feel better about traveling on airplanes and to keep the airplanes from going under but uh definitely there is better attack methods out there 

246.01 247.02 B: sure 

246.24 249.19 A: um and if the terrorists aren't going t- i mean 

249.55 253.03 A: i would be surprised if they if they used the same method twice 

253.18 256.58 B: yeah yeah it's definitely a possibility i mean once you know you figure 

256.85 266.61 B: you do have that you know that that point i just made where you would assume that they would steer away from the things already that have been done and tried move onto something else when in fact you know 

263.77 264.62 A: (( that's right )) 

266.90 273.35 B: the tables are turned backs are turned and and it's considered not as not a uh a possibility any any further any longer 

273.93 283.36 B: it's um see where you're going with that but um you know as far as the airport security i mean i you know i've traveled a little bit and after september eleven and it's 

276.15 277.62 A: mhm 

283.50 293.86 B: you know it really is i mean the i haven't actually traveled from you know l._a._x. as a matter of fact just the kind of local airports but even at the locals you mean you still see you know a certain a a presence but it was 

293.82 299.40 B: was a funny thing that i've noted is that you know a few months after september eleven naturally they had the national guards 

299.58 304.25 B: [lipsmack] that you know any any local local uh airport for that matter 

304.28 314.83 B: and now you don't have that at all and that kinda makes you wonder if it's the guard isn't really letting being let down and thing- things are kind of calming and nobody's really taking it to heart any longer 

315.16 317.22 B: you know but um 

317.66 319.15 B: (( [lipsmack] you know i don't know )) 

317.99 329.23 A: [noise] yeah that was definitely a a a measure to uh make people feel better about the about going back to the airport to see the people there with their m. sixteens uh strapped to their body and uh 

325.19 326.85 B: (( sure yeah )) 

328.59 330.33 B: yeah 

329.65 341.10 A: uh kevlar jackets and all that uh all of that set up you know some people that were kind of worried about the national guard though because it was um [lipsmack] usually the states are 

332.00 333.42 B: (( exactly [mn] )) 

341.30 344.72 A: required to call up the national guard and they're under state control 

344.24 346.75 B: mhm 

345.00 350.69 A: um and new york's supposed to have federal troops pull um enforcing u._s. laws 

350.67 359.76 A: uh in the states as part of the fe- uh federal government but uh but it's par- yeah [mn] well you don't want you know a strong federal government bringing their police in 

353.97 354.95 B: (( really [mn] )) 

359.58 367.24 A: that's why we have a state patrol and uh city uh [noise] uh city policemen but we don't have any you know federal policemen 

367.33 376.03 A: um because uh it's a it's it's against the law except for in special circumstances the federal government can call up the national guard and pay for it 

367.64 369.32 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

371.21 372.82 B: yeah 

376.30 380.51 A: uh and bring 'em in and do that and that's what happened after september eleventh 

378.57 381.34 B: (( yeah )) 

380.62 388.91 A: um but then i think after that the uh states had to pick up the bill and so uh with the shrinking state government's uh budgets 

388.52 389.44 B: (( budgets )) 

389.48 396.11 A: they didn't pay for the national guard anymore and you know people starting to forget about it do you feel better about traveling now [noise] 

391.51 394.82 B: yeah yeah that's true 

396.02 400.11 B: uh you know [mn] it's it's funny and uh it's a really feel 'cause you 

399.98 401.20 B: [mn] certainly as an american 

401.11 401.67 B: (( you know )) 

401.63 402.16 B: (( as an american )) 

402.15 404.89 B: citizen you really never felt the f- the 

404.87 417.16 B: fear or or just the hesitation to to travel period and you know after september eleven that was definitely brought even to myself i even sat down and well am i am i really safe i'd really you know ask myself the question just uh the way things were 

408.14 409.47 A: mhm 

416.81 417.67 A: right 

416.95 421.29 B: (( uh then i'd been able to be honest now i really don't have any hesitations or or )) 

422.26 425.19 B: um you know any any hesitations whatsoever to travel i i 

426.33 430.02 B: i don't know i mean it's always a chance you know it's always a chance that uh 

429.68 430.92 A: right 

430.47 432.41 B: that it's a possibility anywhere you go 

432.66 435.96 B: at this point you know i just had a few close friends travel 

436.54 441.59 B: to uh indonesia of all places and i'm thinking what are you doing you know 

441.47 442.87 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

442.55 457.49 B: there's been quite a few incidents over there they actually went on a surf trip and you actually i'm not sure if you're aware there was a big explosion a few months ago where a surfer was on the same kind of trip and was just happened to be at like a local club or what what have you and ended up being caught in the uh 

457.46 458.65 A: oh yeah 

458.13 459.87 B: the bombing and 

459.30 462.03 A: yeah i heard about those uh that attack over there 

460.82 466.88 B: yeah yeah it's just you know i had a few friends leave this past week and i'm saying to 'em well you know 

467.02 470.35 B: i suppose i'm better off here [laughter] you know they 

469.63 472.59 A: yeah airport security really doesn't help in that case 

472.41 482.73 B: yeah it really doesn't it really doesn't i mean and you when you think about it there's the danger lurks anywhere at this point especially more specific i mean i'd be very hesitant to travel you know 

472.65 474.58 A: [laughter] 

478.52 479.65 A: yeah 

482.85 490.75 B: overseas at right right about now i mean just 'cause it just seems like there's really no there's no guarantee there's just no guaranteeing 

490.58 492.27 A: right 

491.29 495.38 B: anywhere but more specifically you know outta outta the country so um hm 

495.33 500.58 A: right i find that the a- increased airport security is more of a nuisance than anything else 

500.59 502.27 A: it doesn't say 

502.35 514.66 A: i don't think that the even with you know medium security that the airplanes are gonna be attacked again [sigh] but just having all those people there you know without very much training was very annoying i had a um 

515.64 523.00 A: i was traveling one time home with my family and we had been up for hours and we were on this long layover it was like seven in the morning um 

523.27 524.28 A: uh 

524.94 536.72 A: i'm very tired and and i meet this uh i meet this lady uh in a room uh i mean in a corridor it's only room enough for one person because there's so many people sitting around because of flight delays 

536.63 537.77 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

537.13 549.13 A: and uh we meet face to face and i kinda look at her and i'm tired and one of us has to back off in order to make let 'em through [mn] i'm like fine i turn around walk about five feet so she can get through 

549.23 554.16 A: and uh i didn't realize it at the time but she went to a security guard and told them i was on drugs 

554.26 556.21 B: [noise] [laughter] really 

555.74 562.11 A: and i was actually going to the newsstand i went to the newsstand and there was two guys uh with side arms followed me in there 

562.12 573.79 A: and they're kind of looking at stuff and i'd go back to my wife and they follow us back there and then they go off and do their thing and she says you know they c- that she told the security guard you were on drugs and i'm like oh my god 

573.17 575.13 B: yeah 

574.47 581.76 A: and so you know that was only a couple of months after september eleventh and you know they're new there they don't know what to do they don't know what to look for and 

581.68 594.62 A: you know nothing nothing personally happened but just the thought that you know i was under suspicion because some lady made a random comment about me to the new authority figures was uh disturbing it was disturbing to say the least 

581.73 583.50 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

590.73 592.20 B: exactly 

594.55 599.95 B: absolutely yeah it's it's been isn't it amazing you think and you question yourself about what you could really say i mean
