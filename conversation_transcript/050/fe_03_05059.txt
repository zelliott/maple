0.29 1.75 B: hello 

1.10 2.32 A: hi 

2.10 4.11 B: hi i'm ken how are you 

3.68 4.93 A: good jay 

4.59 6.50 B: (( hi jay how are you doing )) 

5.93 10.32 A: good what is what's your thought on these high priced athletes 

9.88 10.87 B: [sigh] 

11.36 15.56 B: well they do make a ton of money that's for sure 

15.81 18.02 B: um you know but they also have 

18.26 20.78 B: a unique skill too that um 

21.52 26.85 B: not everybody has so i mean if they can get the money why not you know 

26.97 31.42 A: true it's just uh my thought on it is that 

31.29 44.03 A: when they go out they do have a skill and they do make a ton of money but when they go on strike i'm not sure i'm in accordance with them on what their issues are when they strike 

43.81 49.64 A: uh football being the uh you know the big stumbling block is the drug testing 

49.26 50.51 B: right 

49.84 55.68 A: uh but uh to me i don't think they should have a leg to stand on on that issue 

55.22 65.90 B: ye- yeah i actually agree with you there i think it depends on the issue you know they're they're striking about i mean if they're striking over just that issue i mean that's just ridiculous [laughter] 

57.74 59.01 A: (( uh [noise] )) 

66.16 73.85 A: right but i mean you know it's a combination in any i get into the attitude and the i think it's also 

73.75 86.40 A: we don't you know the average guy doesn't know what really goes on and when they get down to the nitty gritty of who's asking for what and you know they all they're like politicians they come out of the meetings and they put this spin on it 

85.56 93.25 B: of course they put the spin that they want to have on it i mean i'm i'm sure that's true with any strike situation not just sports too you know 

88.05 89.55 A: yeah and 

93.03 95.27 A: right but you know 

95.46 107.32 A: to me the average strike guy is trying to uh survive trying to get to stay with the cost of living trying not to uh give back on health costs and uh 

103.02 104.11 B: right 

107.42 112.19 A: health care and all that whereas you know these guys never have that issue 

111.46 121.34 B: yeah they definitely don't have that problem and the pendulum has swung too far the other way now they used to be all in favor of the owners and the owners had all the power and basically 

121.43 125.28 B: treated a lot of the players like crap for lack of a better term 

124.99 126.23 A: right 

125.66 133.83 B: and now the pendulum has swung completely the other way and all the control is in the players' hands basically there needs to be some kind of 

134.15 141.67 B: get it back to the middle kind of balance kind of thing how they're going to do that i've no idea given that the players got all this power they're not going to want to give power back 

141.29 151.73 A: but i think the pendulum also has swung on the other issue completely the opposite way of the uh of the average person's perception of what's going on 

151.76 159.50 A: that yes the owners had all the power and the average guy stood behind the players and now i think the pendulum is swinging where 

159.67 174.23 A: the you're starting to say to the players hey you know you got it pretty good you know and the owners we understand that you know hey i'm the guy who went out i'm the guy who put up the four hundred million for the franchise yes i'm entitled to 

164.93 166.02 B: right 

174.29 183.09 A: make a hell of a profit and you know where is it written that in this day and age that employees become part owners of the company now 

182.82 184.05 B: right 

183.42 196.13 A: uh you know yes there's a discrepancy in this you know only so many that really make the big bucks but the the average sport guy is still making close to a million a year 

195.53 197.11 B: oh at least 

196.54 199.16 A: yeah and there's the no name guy 

199.11 206.19 A: and you know unlimited health benefits for life and a you know an unbelievable pension and you know so 

206.14 221.10 A: you know now i think when the issues start coming out you know baseball being the last strike and i guess football maybe on the horizon is the next one in a couple of years i'm not sure how it is i'm not sure whose contract comes up next 

220.49 226.97 B: right well i think baseball the baseball players were very smart this last time to not actually go strike there's 

225.84 233.36 A: right i think they they knew that they didn't have the the uh the people behind them as they had in years past 

232.95 237.76 B: a exactly and i don't to be honest with you i don't know if baseball would have survived another strike like that 

237.18 240.11 A: right you know it took 'em years to just to come back 

239.55 250.31 B: to come back from the last strike and they're they're still i mean they're doing good but they're still not where they used to be as far as that's concerned if they went on another strike it probably would have done 

246.80 248.17 A: yeah and 

250.78 252.22 A: catastrophe 

250.92 253.23 B: irreparable damage to the 

253.20 254.45 A: and probably [noise] 

253.34 254.97 B: to the sport itself 

254.80 268.03 A: hi jake and probably some smart person sat down with both sides and said listen you guys are both nuts uh you know whereas you know you guys both can't afford this this time it'll ruin both of you 

266.17 267.14 B: (( uh right )) 

267.65 268.75 B: mhm 

268.12 275.53 A: and uh you know so i don't remember what the actual outcome was and you know i'm sure they there was give and take a little bit on each side 

274.12 275.36 B: yeah 

275.59 280.88 A: but if this uh drug testing one that's the one that gets my goat that uh 

280.93 282.75 A: (( i think it is football )) 

282.79 284.52 A: it might be baseball too 

285.06 287.51 A: i don't know i'm almost sure it's 

287.88 291.41 A: now that i think about it i think it's an issue with both uh 

291.39 292.78 B: with both sports 

292.16 299.51 A: with both sports because there was the steroid issue last time with baseball and they they were fighting the issue 

296.65 298.45 B: yeah right and that that 

298.54 300.96 B: the guy that died during spring training 

300.39 304.56 A: right and tha- tha- that issue got buried or whatever but 

304.62 310.75 A: you know the again i think a lot of the average joe schmo is starting to 

310.96 320.57 A: correlate it to my life that hey if i try to change my job or for whatever i got to go through you know everybody does a drug test this day and age 

319.98 320.84 B: true 

320.67 333.70 A: uh so you know because you're a star athlete or what you know don't give me this privacy stuff and you know all that stuff you know you're not supposed to be doing it and if you're not doing it you've got nothing to worry about 

328.81 329.92 B: right 

333.16 336.70 B: exactly i know that that i agree with you on there 

334.09 334.89 A: uh 

336.10 340.91 A: and it should be a clear cut boom that's it and you know 

340.51 345.39 B: yeah and we've started giving them chance after chance after chance i mean look at steve howell 

345.30 359.09 A: right oh yeah you could name hund- you know uh uh dozens of 'em that uh have had three or four chances that we never would have had and still come back and make that kind of money so i uh you know i uh 

346.57 348.41 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

348.97 349.88 B: yeah 

352.90 354.04 B: right 

355.99 357.45 B: right i me- 

359.24 365.85 B: i mean you know i'm all for giving people a second chance i mean anybody in their life just because they're an athlete you know doesn't make them a a 

365.96 373.42 A: yeah oh i'll give you a third chance but don't jump up and down and cry that you're uh being mistreated and uh 

367.92 368.95 B: right 

372.72 374.08 B: right 

373.45 379.64 A: that kind of thing so i don't know i think the pendulum is swung that if any of the players 

379.63 391.22 A: were to strike at this moment at this time and age that the uh the general public would be behind the owners and just say you guys are you know too babyish you know 

386.59 387.80 B: right 

391.38 393.60 A: you don't know how good you got it 

392.93 394.41 B: mhm 

393.85 400.74 A: uh and although you have to have a negotiation you're always looking to get a raise you're always not going to get more 

400.31 401.84 B: right 

401.45 417.01 A: but in this day and age if somebody came across and all the union lay offs and the regular life if the company came across and said we're just going to freeze everything after your salary and your benefits and everything and we're going to leave it at that you know i'd sign on the dotted line 

416.96 423.97 A: right now for that uh because you know no one gets a bonus it you know bonus is unheard of any more 

423.79 424.90 B: that's true 

424.59 429.29 A: uh every they all wanted more on the co pay up insurance 

428.90 438.00 B: right oh yeah well in today's today's society you've really got to if you can't work for someone else you need to go out and you know really work for yourself 

438.27 440.09 A: [noise] which is you know 

438.42 439.31 B: (( you if )) 

439.99 447.25 B: you go out and work for someone else you're you're just getting them rich and then when they decide they don't need you any more they just pull the carpet out from under you and next 

446.63 448.98 A: yeah right and uh 

449.04 456.50 A: you know tha- that's where i don't feel sorry for these guys because they do have a talent that is needed [cough] 

455.88 457.35 B: right 

456.76 460.78 A: and they're somewhat safer in life than we are 

461.13 465.30 A: you know as long as you practice and stay in shape and uh 

464.59 468.84 B: yeah and there's always some team that's willing to take a chance on some guy 

468.27 476.19 A: right exactly so as i say again i get back to my point that i don't feel as much as i do for the 

476.72 484.05 A: picket guy outside of walmart picketing for so- whatever reason or striking as i do for ball players 

480.71 481.75 B: right 

484.08 488.87 A: you know i think there's people i would give a limb to be in the position they're in 

488.72 491.69 B: oh yeah definitely they'd be singing [laughter] 

490.15 490.97 A: yeah 

491.55 492.35 A: yeah 

491.71 493.30 B: what are you kidding me 

493.04 494.62 A: yeah so 

494.77 499.79 A: i don't resent 'em or whatever i still enjoy watching the game or anything but when the 

499.80 504.50 A: you know the talk and negotiation comes up or whatever i don't even want to hear it 

503.92 512.32 B: right and you you know you've got people that talk all the time while they go on strike they're never going to go to a game again and then as soon as they're back they're right back at the stadium 

511.84 514.83 A: yeah exactly yeah uh 

513.93 522.21 B: and and that encourages them too because they're like well you know the fans say they're going to be upset but in actuality once we come back they're not [laughter] 

521.81 530.74 A: yeah and there might be a rough year or so but well you know they'll be back and they know that and uh it's just a big game it's just like the politicians 

523.88 524.79 B: right 

525.36 526.40 B: mhm 

531.16 533.33 A: not worth the shoes they walk in 

534.29 536.74 A: but we'll see what happens 

536.07 542.17 B: so hockey's probably going to be the next sport they're talking about with a possible strike now too because their contract is 

542.65 548.43 B: up shortly and they've they've got all sorts of issues going on with hockey they've got teams in bankruptcy and [cough] 

547.81 552.22 A: yeah i mean tha- there you go that would be uh you know i didn't know that one but 

552.33 558.77 A: you know i don't follow hockey i don't like hockey i don't know that much about hockey and so but i would think 

557.82 563.16 B: but jockey's one of those sports that you don't really need to watch the regular season because it doesn't matter anyway 

562.83 563.66 A: right 

563.46 566.68 B: the whole team freaking league makes the play offs [laughter] 

566.01 574.78 A: yeah and but you know there's another one like you're saying that has all these issues already and you're talking a strike what are you nuts 

574.76 576.95 B: yeah 'cause all it's going to do is going to 

577.17 579.10 B: harm the league even more 

578.67 582.16 A: right well it's shaky as it is and uh 

581.00 584.91 B: yeah especially 'cause you know overall it's probably the the fourth 

585.63 589.24 B: argumentatively maybe the fifth most popular sport you 

589.60 593.03 B: know 'cause you've got baseball and football are one and two 

592.84 594.05 A: right 

593.44 594.83 B: and you know there's a 

594.87 597.48 B: lot of people follow basketball then there's 

597.99 599.18 B: hockey 

598.80 599.89 A: right 

599.32 599.89 B: which
