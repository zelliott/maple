216.68 217.74 A: those 

216.80 224.72 B: i don't either and i know that a lot of it uh i'm not familiar with soccer at all i mean but that's 

217.97 218.94 A: yeah 

223.11 224.04 A: mhm 

224.79 231.22 B: but when they play that like in south america or england or what they're 

229.39 230.37 A: mhm 

231.23 234.83 B: they're actually killing people they get so upset 

234.11 236.39 A: yeah i know 

234.93 237.34 B: they go on and they [laughter] i know [laughter] 

236.73 242.30 A: yeah they're crazy about it obsessed about winning the game 

241.83 246.95 B: yes yes and and then they're so and and when the 

242.52 243.58 A: mhm 

243.63 244.50 A: yeah 

247.16 251.34 B: people that win they go tear down all the goal posts and of 

250.84 252.00 A: mhm 

251.38 254.10 B: course they kinda do that in football too but 

253.68 254.97 A: yeah 

254.37 262.13 B: it it just uh and they beat up people and beat up coaches and [laughter] i find that 

258.92 260.18 A: (( yeah )) 

261.63 262.79 A: [laughter] 

262.16 264.49 B: (( just so crazy )) 

263.67 264.88 A: (( yeah you know )) 

265.19 273.14 B: but it's uh certainly what what is the um uh sport like in beijing when you were there 

265.20 266.08 A: (( mm )) 

272.96 275.63 A: uh we like volleyball 

275.71 277.31 B: oh okay 

276.39 281.75 A: those are not touching each other so it's not very violent 

278.43 279.85 B: no no 

281.35 282.19 B: no 

281.95 287.21 A: but it's also a team competition so y- yeah so i do like those 

284.13 285.69 B: it is uh-huh 

285.82 294.78 B: and i guess they during olympics i did not watch that particular thing but they've added now this sand volleyball 

292.77 293.65 A: mhm 

294.86 296.11 A: oh 

295.46 299.53 B: they play on the sand and that was added as a competition 

297.01 298.79 A: yeah mhm 

299.02 300.30 A: mhm 

299.60 304.83 B: that kinda seemed a little strange to me it's more like a beach sport [laughter] 

302.43 303.22 A: (( yeah )) 

304.14 305.48 A: yeah [laughter] 

305.20 306.51 B: rather than a 

305.88 307.51 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

306.81 315.33 B: but yes volleyball at least it's it's not anywhere as violent as as uh some of the others yeah 

308.46 309.27 A: (( mm )) 

311.45 312.73 A: mhm 

313.77 318.94 A: yeah but it also can be very competitive so it's 

317.65 320.50 B: oh extremely yes ve- 

319.09 320.99 A: yeah so i like the yeah 

320.62 326.56 B: absolutely very much so and and uh elicits a lot of uh 

321.58 322.46 A: mhm 

327.33 334.51 B: uh [sigh] strong feelings on both sides it's uh it doesn't seem like sports is fun 

330.30 332.08 A: mhm yeah 

334.52 335.60 A: yeah 

334.52 340.34 B: it's like it's just the winning is so important 

339.69 340.67 A: mhm 

340.41 346.28 B: that even in in uh you know in schools and stuff it's not any more like 

346.23 347.23 A: mhm 

346.36 349.58 B: you know just a a a fun thing to play it's 

349.03 350.05 A: mhm 

350.10 351.06 B: um 

351.16 353.69 B: people get very angry [laughter] 

352.96 355.74 A: mhm yeah yeah 

354.01 360.88 B: so it's uh yeah so uh in in china volleyball is big then huh 

359.10 359.91 A: mhm 

360.70 364.60 A: yes it is a very big thing i think it's because 

362.68 363.36 B: (( uh )) 

364.80 367.97 A: the women [sigh] volleyball team 

368.03 372.90 A: won some the road um champions 

372.89 373.86 B: oh

375.04 375.92 B: (( yes )) 

375.48 378.34 A: hot sport for a long time yeah 

376.75 377.63 B: yes 

378.16 379.13 B: right 

379.27 389.27 B: it's just like if you know when you succeed that always becomes a much bigger thing which in itself is not bad you know to take pride in something you do well 

382.33 383.57 A: mhm 

384.66 385.84 A: yeah 

387.12 387.99 A: yeah

427.68 437.66 A: oh they do ve- they they do becoming taller and taller as uh it's becau- that that that yeah that's because of in the past the main 

430.94 432.18 B: oh really 

432.37 434.26 B: it's all the nutrition now 

437.84 449.18 A: food was rice now the main food is flour and i think flour was is more nutritious nutritious i think getting people

465.64 466.47 B: (( uh-huh ah )) 

467.85 478.86 A: it's really uncomfortable if we eat without ca- just meat you feel so stuffed and uh feel uncomfortable so we we must have vegetable 

471.64 472.54 B: uh-huh 

472.61 473.54 B: yeah 

474.42 475.64 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

476.46 477.24 B: yeah

482.61 485.13 A: yeah mhm yes 

484.05 484.94 B: yeah 

485.57 489.09 B: yeah more and therefore more competitive huh 

488.11 491.61 A: yeah mhm what sports do you play 

491.78 501.95 B: well i don't really play anything when i was very young i used to play like uh um you know baseball and just just for fun you know

505.77 506.77 A: mhm 

507.34 512.43 B: uh tennis that kind of stuff you know like i said again for fun 

508.92 509.90 A: mhm 

510.05 511.70 A: that's okay that's good 

512.23 514.70 A: yeah just for fun yeah f- i know 

512.72 516.53 B: tennis is not bad to watch but i don't understand the rules 

515.97 517.78 A: [laughter] i mean 

517.67 524.59 B: i don't know love zero love zer- they keep playing the same thing i mean keep playing and it doesn't seem to 

517.97 519.22 A: yeah 

520.16 521.35 A: (( i know )) 

521.42 522.66 A: (( [laughter] yeah [sigh] )) 

524.69 529.71 B: i i don't know when you actually score i've never been able to figure that out 

527.68 528.54 A: (( mm )) 

529.41 533.01 A: i know when they are too strong it doesn't 

533.39 534.40 A: i mean 

534.91 538.60 A: well the most important for them is to score so it's not 

539.16 544.40 A: entertaining very very much entertaining so when they 

542.61 543.90 B: yeah it's 

545.17 551.52 A: get the ball over there probably that's it and then the other side get the ball here and that's it they don't 

551.67 554.87 A: bounce the ball to each other very for a long time 

552.46 553.27 B: yeah 

554.91 556.95 A: so i i don't know 

555.49 558.14 B: right and i think sometimes you know if you 

558.50 571.93 B: if you miss it then that should be a point for the other side but it usually for whatever reason isn't so i just really don't understand the rules but i think that would that is kind of a a a graceful sport 

559.73 560.66 A: (( mhm )) 

562.63 563.26 A: (( mm )) 

567.13 568.20 A: mhm 

571.55 572.86 A: mhm yes 

572.06 586.64 B: and i wouldn't mind watching it once in a while but i just don't know the rules and i've never been around people that knew the rules of tennis [laughter] or at least we never discussed it they probably did but some of them but i've never discussed it 

574.56 575.64 A: mhm 

576.86 578.13 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

579.14 579.85 A: (( mm ))
