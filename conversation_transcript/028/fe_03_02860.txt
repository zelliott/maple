4.53 5.83 B: hi laurie i 

5.25 6.20 A: hi 

6.54 11.54 B: understand the topic is sports on t._v. is that uh as you understand it 

10.70 16.29 A: that is my understanding so you're gonna have to do all the all the talking because i never watch sports on t._v. 

15.66 21.18 B: oh you don't well i watch a lot a i i i do watch a lot of sports so that will be easy for me 

16.50 17.51 A: no i don't 

20.41 21.47 A: okay 

21.90 28.32 B: um i'm watching a lot of baseball now i live in the arizona area so i'm arizona diamond backs fan 

27.86 28.88 A: mhm 

28.88 30.96 B: they started pretty slow 

30.95 32.23 A: mhm 

31.59 40.64 B: but uh i i think they have a good team and will recover over the long season they've had some serious injuries to key pitchers 

40.75 46.31 A: now the diamond backs they're next how long has that has that team even existed 

40.97 41.81 B: so they're 

46.08 48.48 B: about five years i think they're 

47.07 50.08 A: [laughter] that shows you how often i watch baseball 

49.55 55.81 B: yeah i think their starting season was uh ninety seven so this is their sixth year i believe 

55.33 56.54 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

55.95 61.33 B: they're the ones who won it all uh two years ago against the yankees they won the world series 

60.76 64.74 A: oh okay they they ran the world the won the world series and i didn't even know it 

64.46 68.82 B: yeah and and that was a surprise for an expansion team to do that 

68.14 71.74 A: well that was the whole thing after september eleventh right 

71.71 75.18 B: uh let me think now was it before that i guess 

74.37 76.29 A: no it was after that i think 

76.12 81.64 B: i'm s- i'm trying to think now i think it was uh the year before that when they won it 

81.52 88.68 A: you know you know what i remember all of that now 'cause there was a big thing that it was just such a wonderful thing that they were going to 

90.18 92.79 A: al- that the yankees were going to almost win 

92.79 102.12 B: yeah right and and the yankees were definitely favorable to realistically and emotionally yeah i think they were they were a favorite to win 

93.62 94.74 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

96.92 97.86 A: mhm 

101.71 102.94 A: mhm 

102.31 117.13 B: the diamond backs were able to do a good job of drafting for a brand new team uh they got some key veterans and they got some key young guys that that played extremely well so as a team they really did put it together 

117.00 118.32 A: mhm 

118.11 123.26 B: and like anybody else who wins then you're the target of everybody else the next year so 

123.00 123.95 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

123.34 128.11 B: uh they they played reasonably well but not well enough to win everything 

127.34 128.19 A: mhm 

128.47 131.01 A: who did win last year i don't even remember 

128.81 129.80 B: (( that )) 

131.64 134.76 B: let's see last year was a 

134.85 145.22 B: west coast team was it the athletics uh i think it was i think it was oakland that won last year or or anaheim one of the california teams won last year 

144.65 145.58 A: mhm 

146.86 153.87 B: and i'm i'm more of a national league fan than an american league fan but uh i'm i'm definitely a baseball fan all the way through 

153.77 154.72 A: mhm 

154.65 157.65 B: and other sports too really uh [noise] 

158.07 160.11 B: i watch i don't know how many 

160.38 169.28 B: how many uh hours or anything i watch a week or a month but i i watch if there's a key game on i watch uh off and on during the whole game 

168.55 169.56 A: mhm 

169.37 177.20 B: and in in recent years i've got real interested in watching golf on t._v. i think the golf uh analysts do a good job 

177.42 183.33 B: of explaining what's going on and i play a lot a golf i live on a golf course so i play a lot of golf too 

183.07 184.13 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

183.97 191.70 B: so it's it's kinda fun to watch the pros and how good they are compared with uh with the everyday amateur players and 

191.03 191.91 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

191.82 196.29 B: how far they hit the ball and all that that sorta thing it's really interesting to watch 

196.30 198.12 A: yeah i 

197.24 202.35 B: 'em but you don't you don't watch all that much sports or not that much interested in the sports huh 

201.94 211.33 A: almost never about the most sporting thing i remember watching regularly were used to like to watch the olympics but i don't even like that anymore 

203.31 204.46 B: oh really 

209.67 210.62 B: uh-huh 

211.24 212.25 B: uh-huh 

212.46 219.73 A: so just something about the sports coverage for that it's gotten very it got very strange the last couple i watched it strange 

212.47 214.01 B: i i i actually it 

217.55 219.22 B: got really what 

219.49 220.94 B: yeah well 

221.05 226.20 B: uh i think uh the olympics uh the international people are 

226.36 232.48 B: they have their own little different agenda and i'm not i'm not always sure that there are all the team sports that are 

232.68 235.40 B: as honest and ethical as they could be 

235.11 236.37 A: mhm 

235.95 240.00 B: you know i'd i i remember in days gone past where the russians uh 

240.12 247.29 B: were definitely biased in favor of their own and and i think in recent years some of the other countries have too 

247.44 254.22 B: they they just don't seem to have the same degree of fairness as as uh some of the other countries do 

253.90 259.79 A: [sigh] well there always there is also the the stuff about the steroids that they were taking too mm 

259.17 261.20 B: oh that too sure 

261.21 273.01 B: and and i guess one of the problems is it's not an equal playing field for all of the countries you know in certain certain countries respect the rules a lot more than others and they get by with 

273.50 287.05 B: with more things and they're permitted to do more things and it just some times you're you look at the the people involved the caliber of the people involved and say you know is this really uh is this really on the up and up 

286.85 293.67 A: yeah yeah but i think unfortunately still is the olympics i think it's everybody not just us 'cause i know the whole thing with 

287.79 288.90 B: (( and )) 

293.71 301.75 A: when they had it in salt lake city and then they came out at all the bribes as salt lake city had paid to get the olympics i think that was 

300.52 302.85 B: yeah i agree with you they 

302.39 304.65 A: that was pretty distasteful [laughter] 

303.71 317.80 B: yeah and you don't you don't really know everything that's going on you you the media i think in recent years has done a better job of keeping track of what's going on but even then you you probably don't know five percent of what's really going on 

317.54 318.43 A: yeah 

319.00 320.15 B: but uh 

319.15 325.35 A: but yes i remember years ago i used to really enjoy watching the olympics and really look forward to it 

324.96 325.88 B: uh-huh 

325.41 327.97 A: and now i really couldn't care less [laughter] mhm 

327.38 335.16 B: really yeah well i i i i can understand that and i feel the same way to a certain extent one of the things i like about watching 

335.14 345.63 B: some of the american team sports is because of the competition and because of i think it's it's reasonably well controlled so that that kinda stuff doesn't happen 

345.65 357.31 B: i mean the the teams play hard and the players play hard and the i think they've kept uh scandals out of it to a great extent at least that's my perception i i i really think that's true 

352.86 354.10 A: mhm 

357.53 362.20 A: yeah i mean i- i'm i must say you don't really hear that much like for baseball it's 

357.88 358.56 B: (( but )) 

362.41 366.94 A: occasionally they have a scandal but really not very often but mm mhm 

366.66 374.98 B: well you know it's it's like probably anything else in this world you you have a couple of rotten apples and they make all the news 

375.13 384.72 B: and ninety nine percent of the guys are good guys with families and and try to play hard and play fair but it's it seems like it's always the bad guy who gets the press 

385.26 392.16 B: and y- there's probably no greater percentage of good guys or bad guys playing professional sports than anything else 

388.87 390.34 A: yeah well you 

391.30 397.08 A: well with baseball you really don't hear you hear of a scandal every now and then but not that many 

396.92 399.20 B: and not not in recent years 

397.49 400.04 A: (( much more is that but much more is basketball )) 

400.71 402.12 B: what's that 

401.22 404.58 A: much more with basketball than uh football than baseball 

404.57 410.23 B: see i i i'm not sure why i think uh i don't know i don't know the answer to that one 

410.53 414.36 B: and i think it's it kinda runs in cycles sometimes too 

413.96 414.79 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

414.99 417.09 B: but i i think that um 

417.62 423.58 B: i enjoy watching sports uh again i've played sports a lot when i was younger and it's 

423.43 437.99 B: it's i think very interesting to watch the caliber of today's athlete either whether it be basketball or baseball or football or golf or or tennis or anything else it's how how good they really are and how uh 

438.13 443.57 B: you know how capable they really are as it really is amazing some of 'em 

442.47 449.55 A: yeah do you watch just a broadcast or the cable channels or the or just premium ones or 

449.48 457.48 B: well uh both uh i have cable t._v. and living in a big metropolitan area like phoenix uh 

457.49 466.31 B: they have good local coverage of right now for example it's baseball but they have good local coverage of of football on basketball on baseball 

465.91 474.82 A: yeah i live right outside of d- uh d._c. so they don't show that much of that baseball because we don't have a team here 

466.33 467.92 B: and and that 

469.37 470.36 B: uh-huh 

474.37 477.77 B: yeah true you might have one shortly who knows 

477.47 490.38 A: well is well they're they're working on getting one and three of the possible sites are very near my house in fact one of them one of them is maybe a five minute walk which i do hope they don't pick that one 

483.95 485.23 B: are they really 

490.31 501.03 B: yeah been living at while we've had similar problems out here with with uh some of the the people trying to bring in uh professional football and uh 

491.71 492.50 A: (( i mhm )) 

501.12 509.35 B: you know it's one of those things that fits in my my neighborhood i don't really want it but if it fits in the other neighborhood that's fine [laughter] and i and i think that's rea- that's 

506.97 507.92 A: yeah 

509.30 517.09 B: common sense realism you don't wanna make you don't want your streets becoming a a hundred thousand people every sunday afternoon 

510.84 511.78 A: yeah 

516.95 520.16 A: well exactly i mean i just don't see 

520.19 521.73 A: well they site there 

522.02 527.53 A: there are like three different sites in virginia and three different sites within d._c. that 

526.87 527.78 B: uh-huh 

527.77 540.97 A: they are looking at and one of the ones in virginia is literally a five minute walk from my house and it's an urban it's an urban area anyway i don't even see how they're going to where they have the room to fit to fit the stadium 

529.46 530.42 B: uh-huh 

540.70 543.03 B: really the stadium on the 

541.29 548.28 A: i mean they talking about the a particular apartment complex it's i guess that they would raze and it's an older one and i can sort of understand 

547.08 548.05 B: uh-huh 

548.49 555.01 B: but then all the infrastructure that's required the r- the roads and parking and everything else is like a 

553.68 558.81 A: but i don't even see that it's big enough for a s- for a for a regulation size field 

558.56 559.76 B: is that right 

559.42 560.48 A: i mean it's 

560.68 562.58 A: not that big an area 

560.82 561.83 B: (( isn't bal- )) 

562.22 570.07 B: isn't the ownership of the baltimore team fighting that too they're afraid that they'll lose some of their fans to uh to a d- to a washington 

570.13 574.05 B: d._c. uh team i've i think i've read something about that 

573.04 577.98 A: i really don't know if they're fighting it or not i mean i just the part that i've heard 

575.68 576.59 B: uh-huh 

578.01 583.18 A: paid more attention to i suppose different coalitions that are scouting the areas because is 

582.59 584.80 B: i see i see 

584.22 591.63 A: that really i mean i've i've never been to baltimore for a game and i never but i don't really care about that it's the part that 

588.45 589.47 B: uh-huh 

590.58 591.44 B: uh-huh 

593.05 599.89 A: you know i'm and the the selfish part of me just looks at do i i do i really wanna stadium two minutes from my house no
