509.13 518.09 B: you know i thought of uh oh my gosh now see why that's another i another one with the monotony where they just you know like okay there's gotta be an end in sight somewhere 

517.21 522.87 A: right if i wanna bowl i'm gonna go bowl i'm not gonna sit and watch anybody else bowl 

520.77 521.90 B: right 

522.50 532.57 B: well and you know with bowling that's one of those things where they're so good i mean the best they could do is a strike so they're throwing strike after strike after strike and it's like okay
