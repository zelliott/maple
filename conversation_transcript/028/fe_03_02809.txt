8.91 10.24 A: [laughter] 

11.27 13.01 A: sure why not [laughter] 

12.40 15.34 B: um do you watch any sports on t._v. 

15.38 21.34 A: um sometimes when the olympics roll around i kinda wa- i watch might watch some gymnastics of um 

21.43 23.20 A: like the ice skating 

22.85 24.17 B: mhm 

23.32 29.34 A: diving the swimming those kinds of things but um i don't really watch any that are on regularly 

29.01 37.31 B: oh i'm not a sports person either however um i don't know where you live i live near boston so i when 

37.27 46.24 B: t- when the boston teams get to the play offs and i really wanna be disappointed i will watch them [laughter] 

42.37 44.36 A: [laughter] 

44.74 47.27 A: yeah well that's one way to look at it [laughter] 

46.43 48.46 B: um [lipsmack] do you 

48.47 50.64 B: do you ever follow your local teams 

50.67 55.85 A: no [laughter] i couldn't even tell you where they are in the standings i have no idea 

51.53 52.58 B: never 

55.05 61.90 B: oh no no no i can't tell you that i can just tell who the what the different teams are for the different sports 

61.28 67.64 A: oh yeah that that's about yeah i yes if you give me the name of a team i could tell you what sport it was but that's [laughter] 

62.00 62.86 B: [laughter] 

66.05 68.78 B: [laughter] um 

68.49 72.18 A: well i do sometimes i watch the the strongest man competition 

71.76 74.32 B: the strongest man competition huh 

73.59 83.62 A: yeah just because they do really wacky things like they um they'll pick up like a a giant ball that metal ball that weighs like three hundred pounds and they gotta see how far they can carry it or 

83.02 84.29 B: [laughter] 

83.74 88.24 A: i m [laughter] i mean that that's pretty 'cause it's like it's more of a um 

88.52 94.54 A: different kinda interesting thing it's not just uh chasing after the ball and throwing it to different places uh you know 

94.18 95.12 B: mhm 

95.18 99.22 A: so sometimes i watch that but not i wouldn't say regularly either 

95.32 95.93 B: (( mm )) 

99.11 107.73 B: no i'm i'm not a great sports fan uh like yourself i you know occasionally i have 

108.51 116.64 B: i don't turn on the t._v. to watch a sports game but my neighbor is always watching sports in the garage so sometimes i'll when i'm wandering 

116.58 130.26 B: in or out you know i'll stop by and say hello to him and end up watching the game for a couple of minutes or when i come home i'll ask what the score is and who's ahead and you know get the groans and the moans and what's going on there um 

118.62 119.58 A: (( mhm )) 

127.40 128.41 A: (( ah )) 

130.31 138.57 B: and occasionally like i said when um the broones or the celtics or the red sox have gotten to the play offs i w- i will watch them 

138.35 153.33 B: i do go to um the red sox games uh infrequently like once or twice a year to watch them live but i- it's much better to see them on t._v. because well like last friday night it was much warmer at home than it was in the [laughter] in the stadium 

144.74 145.94 A: oh okay 

151.03 152.54 A: [laughter] 

153.04 154.86 A: i can imagine yeah 

154.45 167.80 B: and um additionally when you're watching on t._v.s they can always do the rebroadcast and you don't hear the peanut vendors and guys throwing things throwing food in front of you or everyone getting drunk and getting sick around 

162.56 164.00 A: mhm 

166.30 169.30 A: right and you're not sitting in an uncomfortable seat and 

168.42 171.98 B: you no and you can get up and go to the bathroom and come back 

171.30 172.49 A: right 

173.08 174.04 B: but you 

173.12 175.70 A: i can't remember what the other questions asked were 

174.98 176.83 B: oh how often uh 

176.97 185.01 B: what you watch how long you watch [laughter] but when the olympics are on you do like some of the sports 

179.25 182.51 A: oh [laughter] okay i think we covered that [laughter] 

184.91 186.99 A: yeah sometimes i mean um 

187.41 192.77 A: som- and i mean they get boring if you watch too much of it because a lot of it's the same thing over and over again 

192.32 193.28 B: mhm 

192.86 201.15 A: you know that you could just watch it and sixteen different people doing and trying to do the same thing but um yeah i do tend to watch a little more when the olympics is on 

195.05 196.14 B: (( [sigh] )) 

200.95 205.06 B: [sigh] and you it sounds like you have different sports for different seasons too 

205.30 208.71 A: um well i kind of i mean um 

208.89 213.61 A: i like uh well it was either of the olympics the winter or the summer those events that i like 

213.49 214.43 B: mhm 

213.96 215.28 A: but um 

215.63 221.01 A: i wouldn't say that i'm a fan of any of the seasonal sports you know like baseball or football or 

221.35 223.37 A: anything like that 

222.74 228.65 B: i'm sorry i meant for the different seasons of the olympics 'cause there's the winter olympics and there's summer olympics [noise] 

226.34 229.17 A: oh yeah uh-huh right 

229.63 230.95 A: yeah that's true 

232.03 235.34 B: did you ever play any sports yourself when you were in school 

234.90 236.68 A: nope [laughter] 

235.67 240.45 B: (( [laughter] w- did you ever watch any sports when [laughter] you were in school )) 

238.68 240.64 A: [laughter] 

240.90 246.88 A: uh not very often actually i mean i think i went to a couple of games but that's that's pretty much about it i was i 

246.98 248.69 A: wasn't really too into that 

248.50 249.43 B: mhm 

249.98 250.93 B: uh 

251.06 253.53 A: does anybody else in your family watch a lot of sports 

253.08 266.05 B: um my dad watches sports but then he's somewhat disabled so that's about all he can do um and it's interesting because growing up he never watched sports never ever 

260.34 261.41 A: uh 

264.68 266.41 A: oh okay and 

266.09 267.07 B: um 

266.68 269.06 A: he just started getting into it lately [noise] 

268.45 278.72 B: yeah i the last couple of years and what's interesting is you know i grew up in this family of non sports participants or non sports watchers but the um 

279.60 281.95 B: the patriots were 

281.80 290.58 B: the b- uh when patriots were a big football team two years ago they came from way far behind and actually won and what was interesting is 

290.42 299.72 B: my mother who never even sits down in front of the t._v. actually said she watched the last few games where they actually c- came from behind and had these amazing 

296.17 297.17 A: [laughter] 

299.75 300.69 B: uh 

300.90 306.98 B: games and plays and things and she was excited uh it was very exciting that was a year ago 

306.82 308.11 A: oh okay 

307.14 308.40 B: and um 

308.56 311.19 B: but yes i- it's interesting yeah 

311.32 312.76 B: we're not sports 

311.55 316.71 A: now see my family's a um my dad's really heavily into auto races which kinda makes me 

316.83 330.58 A: totally against watching auto races [laughter] because they were like every single weekend he was watching one and and or then he even went to some of them and it's incredibly boring when you're like ten years old and watching the cars go round the track tim- you know hundreds of times 

317.63 320.37 B: [laughter] 

329.84 334.56 B: [laughter] and it is hundreds of times [laughter] 

330.66 331.79 A: [laughter] 

332.38 336.82 A: mhm yeah we went to like the indy five hundred and mhm 

334.66 336.12 B: did you really 

337.22 345.13 A: yeah i mean you'd think that'd be exciting but it uh the only parts that ex- that are exciting are the very beginning the very ending and if there's ever a crash [laughter] 

344.28 348.65 B: i was gonna say you know you sort of live for the crashes because that's the exciting part 

348.04 351.99 A: mhm yeah i mean it's it's kind of sad to say but yeah yeah [laughter] 

348.79 349.94 B: (( and )) 

350.34 351.61 B: it's gruesome [noise] 

352.10 361.87 A: that's true yeah and um both my parents are into baseball and my dad watches all the basketball and football so i'm kinda like the oddball i guess [laughter] 

361.76 364.39 B: do you have siblings that watch or not [noise] 

363.86 368.65 A: um yeah i have a sister and she yeah she g- and she watches the baseball and and uh 

368.86 373.46 A: i don't think she's too into football or basketball but she's pretty much into baseball 

373.86 374.47 B: (( [noise] )) 

375.02 376.67 B: to each their own 

375.18 376.29 A: so just me 

377.07 381.07 B: th- there's lots of things to do in life besides watch sports on t._v. 

380.64 382.41 A: exactly [laughter] 

381.84 384.21 B: [laughter] what are some of the things you do instead 

384.38 390.16 A: um i do a lot of r- uh you know playing with the kids and i go on the internet a lot uh 

387.37 388.32 B: mhm 

390.19 392.44 A: i read a lot i'm 

392.75 396.10 A: i don't know sports just don't seem to be too important to me 

395.84 397.78 B: okay yeah so that makes 

397.01 398.10 A: (( what about you )) 

398.29 401.90 B: um read or walk uh 

402.41 411.75 B: anything that requires me not to sit in front of the t._v. [laughter] participatory actions are much more preferred 

405.35 406.47 A: [laughter] 

406.70 408.29 A: (( yeah huh )) 

411.31 417.66 A: mhm i agree if i if i do watch t._v. i'm gene- i'm usually watching like the food channel or 

413.05 414.12 B: but 

417.79 422.70 A: or uh something that's gonna benefit me in some way and something i can learn from or 

422.96 431.54 B: well is there a way to say that the food channel is a sports i mean you watch emeril or the naked chefs or some of those guys and you know that's all it's a very 

427.33 428.95 A: yeah [laughter] 

429.14 432.19 A: (( yeah they're kind of sporty yeah [laughter] )) 

431.47 438.05 B: you know it's sort of like watching horseback riding it's a very different type of sport [laughter] 

433.95 435.05 A: yeah 

435.44 436.70 A: [laughter] 

437.12 438.58 A: yeah that's true 

439.32 447.10 B: no and um iron chefs that's that's you know uh an hour long competition [laughter] 

441.85 443.16 A: mhm 

443.96 447.89 A: yeah i guess that some people would consider that a sport yeah [laughter] 

448.12 449.68 B: so that is sporting 

449.26 453.37 A: yeah probably not quite what they intended by sports but [laughter] 

453.03 457.11 B: you know everyone has their own different interpretation [laughter] 

456.26 458.04 A: yeah [laughter] 

458.46 460.82 A: do you have any kids that are involved in sports or 

460.31 462.60 B: um no i don't have any children 

462.19 463.30 A: oh okay 

463.03 465.02 B: no um yours 

464.87 470.70 A: um my step son's he's played uh soccer and he's uh right now he's in track 

470.85 472.35 B: so he's in high school 

472.16 474.92 A: but no he's in uh he's gonna be in junior high next year um 

474.36 475.81 B: okay well 

475.90 478.02 B: that's a lot of dedication 

477.81 485.05 A: yeah so once he gets like when you know once he goes to junior high and high school and he gets like if he's on a team then i'll probably start watching those games 

485.21 487.50 A: 'cause i'll have more of an interest in them but 

486.76 490.28 B: [sigh] right you'll have a f- family member that you're rooting for 

488.70 494.10 A: right uh-huh exactly more of a personal kind of interest in it and 

494.17 497.13 A: but uh until then probably not [laughter] 

496.37 499.27 B: [laughter] do you only have the one child 

499.06 503.65 A: um i have two others but [mn] one's only two and the other one's six months so 

503.76 509.72 B: neither of them are you know sport right now is uh how much can you pull out of the laundry basket 

508.82 513.90 A: right yeah exactly [laughter] how fast can i run away and 

509.83 510.88 B: [laughter] 

514.16 516.84 A: [noise] yeah so that yeah 

517.15 523.06 B: [mn] that's a very different yeah i can understand how your life would be going in other directions right now 

522.52 526.16 A: yeah yeah you gotta focus on what's important and 

525.55 528.62 B: mhm a six month old is quite a challenge 

528.28 532.14 A: yeah especially when you got a toddler running round too [laughter] 

531.28 534.79 B: yeah that sounds like more than enough 

534.28 538.58 A: mhm leaves me no time to get involved in anything like that 

539.79 541.81 B: and boy or a girl 

541.81 543.35 A: uh they're all boys 

542.79 546.10 B: they're all boys oh my 

543.64 544.99 A: all boys 

545.59 549.61 A: [laughter] i'm the only female in the house other than the dog 

550.50 552.48 B: (( oh [sigh] )) 

551.60 553.38 A: [laughter] 

552.65 561.50 B: woman who works with me has the same situation so you just come in and say how are the boys [laughter] and they're all boys even the grown up one 

557.47 559.32 A: yeah [laughter] 

561.16 562.25 A: uh-huh 

562.31 563.85 A: exactly 

563.50 565.23 B: (( oh it well )) 

565.25 573.33 A: but see i'm lucky too that my husband doesn't like watching sports on t._v. so i don't have to uh you know since i don't like it either then i don't have to 

573.67 578.89 A: you know fight for control of the t._v. or come in and watch something that i find completely boring or 

578.23 580.48 B: mhm yeah that is 

579.35 581.07 A: anything like that so 

581.11 583.92 B: that is really good that makes it a lot easier to 

585.08 589.27 B: to get to the food channels and the other sporting events that you do like 

588.53 590.43 A: yeah exactly 

591.32 592.26 A: yeah 

593.12 599.89 A: i and i can't see myself ever really getting into following a a team like uh you know one of the national teams or any
