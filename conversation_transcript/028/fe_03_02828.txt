85.09 94.05 A: yeah and i i don't know if that's why i like it or [laughter] if it's just funny to see 'em fighting on the floor because they got these big pads on and no one seems to get hurt but 

88.40 89.42 B: oh [laughter] 

93.59 102.95 B: well they seldom get hurt like that a lot of time it's the spectators [noise] i used to when i was in high school i used to [noise] uh usher uh hockey games in omaha

132.23 134.35 A: uh a couple of times it would hit the 

134.63 143.58 A: fleck the glass but it would flip over the top but [mn] by that time the momentum had ch- changed it wasn't quite as powerful but it still could hurt ya if it hit ya 

137.44 138.75 B: uh-oh [laughter] 

140.40 141.03 B: oh 

142.92 147.89 B: well as long as the players didn't come tumbling [laughter] down just flecked the glass yeah

232.58 239.42 A: yeah but he was in the house he either had it onto discovery channel history or sports of some description [noise] so 

238.79 241.01 B: tha- that's about right that's that's 

241.02 243.08 B: i watch that that and the news 

242.30 243.97 A: [laughter] it must be a man thing

269.15 273.50 B: uh financed the deal i don't know how it works out but they were on a brink of uh 

273.59 277.82 B: uh ending it so i'm glad to see 'em back in business really 

277.40 286.51 A: [noise] yeah and some of it's more exciting than watching the men play sometimes i know our local uh high school girls are much more exciting than the boys are so 

285.80 291.04 B: you know i see that all the time and in in the newspaper and there's um [lipsmack] 

291.11 294.88 B: we take a [sigh] a subscription to a little um 

294.99 298.75 B: paper and uh almac washington and um 

298.79 308.68 B: it there's it's uh one big huge county one of the biggest ones in the state and it covers about eight or nine different school districts and um 

308.65 319.34 B: and they just the girls really put effort into it and they get out and scream hard and scrap and [laughter] and uh just really put on a show you know 

314.38 315.36 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

316.43 318.49 A: [laughter] exactly

328.89 331.54 B: wow [laughter] [cough] 

329.09 331.82 A: so that was that was a good thing 

331.87 339.66 A: or actually it was the state it was not national it was the state championship but they went on to do some national and did a pretty good showing there too but 

331.88 333.14 B: (( pretty impressive )) 

339.77 341.51 B: (( that's good good oh )) 

340.92 342.95 A: but i just um 

343.46 351.62 A: right now with i have two kids in college and it's kinda hard to to do any kind of [noise] sports activities my daughter my youngest daughter 

351.50 361.94 A: is probably the biggest sports fan we have in our family she watches [noise] whatever she can find on tv [laughter] she's like her dad when it comes to that kind of stuff which is unusual for a girl 

362.17 365.15 B: yeah is she is she at home 

362.54 364.06 A: (( [noise] but )) 

364.52 368.10 A: [noise] no she lives in indianapolis she goes to school over there 

367.82 369.09 B: oh okay 

368.44 374.20 A: and so she has a friend who is one of the dancers for um sh- um the pacers 

374.40 379.75 A: and so she gets tickets occasionally to go watch them play too so she enjoys that 

374.49 375.29 B: yeah 

377.85 390.13 B: well you know i [cough] i watch it but i don't even know who's who's uh in the playoffs and like that i see it and i know dallas uh [noise] beat uh portland in men's basketball uh n._b._a. 

390.24 394.83 B: uh but i don't know who the finals that are starting to play so 

394.77 395.93 A: right 

394.91 397.73 B: i guess i don't watch it that much um 

397.01 398.38 A: yeah 

398.07 399.38 B: but anyway it's 

399.03 403.62 A: well no my daughter went to new york to see butler play in the sweet sixteen but 

403.02 405.01 B: oh wow wow well 

403.72 407.31 A: yeah that was the first time so she enjoyed that 

405.59 406.75 B: when we saw it 

406.98 408.35 B: we saw it um 

408.63 415.02 B: as a local team we live about uh sixty five sixty miles west of spokane washington and uh 

415.17 420.10 B: there's a a gonzales university uh which is a catholic school 

419.47 420.67 A: (( right [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

420.18 431.67 B: and i'm not catholic but i really follow them like crazy and uh they go to the they're [noise] i think for the last four or five years they've been selected to go to the to the uh 

431.79 438.08 B: final four and and stuff like that and they make it to the sixteenth you know and then they [laughter] they kind of peter out [noise] 

437.54 443.73 A: [laughter] well yeah well you know it it's exciting just to get that far i think 

443.67 444.69 B: oh yeah 

443.90 448.71 A: once you get down to that that's even it's an honor in itself but uh 

448.79 455.13 A: they played hard and they they did a good showing but they didn't do anything past the first game of the sweet sixteen so 

455.29 457.42 B: well that that's an accomplishment that really is 

456.80 464.61 A: [noise] yeah that's what i told her and and for her to get to go was even exciting too she's trying to as much as she can while she's in school so 

464.52 465.34 B: yeah 

464.69 466.04 A: and that's a good thing 

466.09 471.25 B: well she needs to [lipsmack] pick up some mementos from from those things so 

470.48 471.31 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

471.54 472.87 A: oh i'm sure she 

471.77 472.67 B: (( i would )) 

473.13 477.61 A: kept tickets and probably bought shirts or something of that effect but [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

476.62 483.02 B: oh i know i think uh two years ago my uh daughter-in-law was in seattle and uh 

483.51 485.80 B: she's from missouri and uh 

486.04 490.09 B: we were uh watching the local gonzaga uh 

490.16 499.63 B: kids go to basketball to the sweet sixteen and like that and t. shirts t. shirts were like mm twenty or twenty two dollars 

499.09 500.20 A: (( yeah )) 

500.34 502.43 B: so we had to have a couple of 

502.12 509.60 A: yeah and it's i think they sometimes overprice everything i know we went to the see our girls play the high school girls play state 

506.67 507.37 B: (( those )) 

509.58 519.68 A: and the tickets were ten dollars which wasn't too bad but you were inside their consequo arena in indianapolis and refreshments were horrendous [laughter] 

518.86 521.67 B: oh oh yeah they re- are 

520.33 523.51 A: i mean the soda was like five dollars for a 

523.54 526.79 A: sixteen ounce cup that was ridiculous but 

526.14 527.81 B: yeah they uh don't 

526.83 529.29 A: they get ya once you're inside you're uh 

529.39 530.57 A: kind of uh 

529.56 534.28 B: that was one of the complaints from the high school playoff the state uh the 

534.35 537.59 B: the b. uh uh level 

537.60 545.28 B: uh basketball teams which in comprise the real small towns in the state uh have a 

545.34 557.64 B: a state playoff in spokane and there was some comments and letters to the editor to the local paper about the high prices in it you know that talking about when when the families get there 

557.57 567.70 B: and some people the prices are so [noise] high they just use that as their vacation time and they don't do anything [laughter] just go to watch the kids play basketball 

566.75 568.87 A: [noise] [laughter] well that's true 

568.92 570.03 A: that's true 

568.93 571.43 B: (( they settle for that anyway )) 

570.35 579.73 A: but you just about have to i think if you're going to especially if your family's very large you can't even afford to take your kids to high school games anymore the tickets are so 

575.78 576.53 B: yeah 

579.26 580.95 B: [laughter] 

579.88 591.07 A: so expensive i know when my kids were in high school um we would buy their super pass 'cause my daughter was a cheerleader so we went to practically everything they had so 

581.50 582.26 B: yeah 

591.06 592.48 B: oh that's neat 

591.79 595.40 A: it was m- much cheaper for us to to buy
