184.56 186.47 B: oh i've seen that too 

186.46 193.84 A: and and when that's on then i don't mind watching it but you know most of the time the thing is just too quick

319.76 322.35 B: my son plays soccer but i don't 

322.38 325.68 B: i mean i like watching him play but i don't watch it on t._v. 

325.50 326.32 A: uh-huh 

327.05 328.73 B: isn't la crosse the one 

329.30 330.54 B: where they have the 

330.97 333.17 B: sticks that have a net in the end 

332.79 336.84 A: yes i believe so yeah it's similar to hockey 

333.53 335.87 B: and they catch the ball yeah 

336.70 337.54 B: (( [noise] )) 

337.49 342.80 A: except on a on turf you know on ground instead of hockey i mean instead of ice mhm 

341.05 342.01 B: yeah 

342.82 347.38 B: oh you know what my son found on t._v. this weekend i think it was called slam basketball 

347.49 354.41 B: it was like regular basketball except they had on each end of the court like trampolines built into 

354.56 355.63 B: the court 

356.10 361.56 B: so they could go down and bounce up and somebody could bounce them the ball and they could slam dunk it [laughter] 

360.94 362.68 A: oh really 

361.67 364.15 B: yeah it was really wild 

364.46 367.26 B: and there were four people on each team 

367.63 368.60 B: so it was 

368.95 372.27 B: it seemed faster than even regular ba- basketball 

372.36 373.01 A: (( mm )) 

372.47 381.34 B: because they just go down bounce and get it in you know and they're harder to get it in too because the other guy can bounce just as high because of the trampoline so there's no 

376.03 377.01 A: wow 

381.63 383.28 B: the height didn't make a difference 

383.08 385.14 A: wow that's interesting 

384.72 386.33 B: yeah it was kinda neat 

386.07 393.25 A: yeah absolutely um so what ou- out of all the sports which is your favorite one to watch on t._v.

404.27 405.38 B: yeah 

405.56 406.34 A: (( um )) 

406.53 410.28 A: but i used to go to all the nick games in madison square garden 

409.93 411.37 B: oh wow 

410.96 412.67 A: years and years ago 

412.26 413.19 B: yeah 

412.82 417.54 A: but i don't know a soul on any of the teams and i guess i've lost a lot of interest in 

417.64 419.33 A: (( you know basketball )) 

418.86 419.79 B: right 

419.77 421.67 A: (( so but um ))

495.03 495.81 A: (( mm )) 

495.13 497.85 B: encouraging the violence it was really surprising 

497.80 502.78 A: oh well there is one more sport i think well two more actually i think that we missed one was wrestling 

502.98 505.05 B: oh yeah i don't like wrestling

530.48 539.99 A: babysitting him uh uh i had no choice in the matter and and all it is to me watching wrestling is is just a big act 

531.99 533.07 B: yeah 

539.75 540.58 B: right 

540.52 549.31 A: i mean there there really isn't any hurt or oh yes they can get hurt no no question about it but i mean basically it's just a big big act 

549.42 552.53 B: yeah but i wonder i mean my son watches it and he's eleven 

552.39 553.13 A: uh-huh 

552.71 554.51 B: and i don't like that he watches it 

554.11 555.70 A: oh i don't think he should 

555.46 557.08 B: yeah just because 

556.97 558.43 A: it's violent 

557.82 559.61 B: yeah and how does he know what's 

560.09 561.38 A: exactly 

560.74 563.39 B: you know i mean he tells me mom i know it's fake but 

563.62 565.25 B: there's too much violence 

564.95 568.74 A: absolutely and there's enough in this world and you don't need to encourage it 

568.09 569.56 B: yeah exactly 

569.31 576.30 A: yeah but um you know wrestling is um when they throw them out of the ring and 

575.83 576.81 B: yeah 

576.67 578.36 A: that that's i 

579.11 581.13 A: don't know that's a little bit much 

580.80 581.76 B: right 

582.49 584.90 A: and then they pick up chairs and and kinda 

584.98 587.37 A: clobber them over the head with a chair 

587.06 589.41 B: i know they get really rough [noise] 

589.01 590.42 A: (( absolutely )) 

590.67 594.74 A: and then the women get inv- watching women i think is even worse 

594.16 595.20 B: yeah 

595.68 597.75 A: i don't know i don't know why 

598.06 599.89 B: well they hardly wear anything
