4.32 10.84 B: [laughter] um very well um i guess the topic today is um sports on t._v. correct 

10.48 12.50 A: that's true something about 

12.64 17.96 A: your favorite sport and how many hours do you spend watching it and stuff like that 

17.39 19.97 B: [laughter] good okay 

18.61 19.62 A: (( [noise] )) 

19.72 21.19 A: so um 

21.90 27.72 A: well i would say out of all the sports on television and there's a lot of sports of television 

22.06 23.63 B: [noise] 

27.24 28.41 B: that's right 

28.42 31.33 A: uh i would say i watch basketball the most [mn] 

31.23 32.33 B: okay 

32.90 38.26 B: and i think uh when it's football season i definitely watch my home team 

38.23 39.25 A: mhm 

38.47 40.54 B: so i appreciate football 

40.78 43.48 B: um n._f._l. football 

43.02 44.15 A: mhm 

43.58 46.95 B: um so that's probably my favorite 

47.11 54.25 B: and then next um i guess year round um because basketball now has its season too 

54.73 68.29 B: um but uh other sports i watch i'll i'll watch bowling um it can get a little boring but i watch it yeah i used to bowl so i i enjoy watching 

62.27 64.05 A: you watch bowling 

64.24 65.41 A: (( ah [mn] )) 

66.26 69.05 A: ah well there's the connection yeah

71.93 74.66 B: [noise] oh i i like watching pool too 

74.12 77.64 A: yeah i think that's uh but is that a sport 

78.56 82.22 A: i know bowling is but i don't know if pool is a sport 

81.12 83.87 B: [mn] yeah because uh they have tournaments 

83.36 85.32 A: that's true right [noise] 

84.14 95.86 B: like um you know the national or the world championships or [sigh] um i think i think pool is a recreational sport yeah and they have it on t._v. so [laughter] 

92.16 93.00 A: (( [noise] yeah [mn] )) 

96.18 101.35 A: yeah i would say it as far as basketball i i maybe i watch during the playoffs 

101.67 102.61 B: more 

102.28 114.06 A: it's whew there's just so much just that unless you've got a getting paid to watch it [laughter] then it's really not worth it but i would say per week basketball maybe a coupla hours 

107.71 108.85 B: right 

113.96 114.97 B: okay 

115.17 126.71 B: and football during the football session i'll watch the whole game so if it's three and a half hours or three hours or whatever and i'll even watch some of the uh pre so probably four hours in that week 

126.28 128.29 A: that's a sunday afternoon uh 

127.63 130.93 B: yes that's right or monday night football yes 

131.87 133.53 A: (( that's interesting )) 

133.07 134.18 B: okay 

134.58 142.30 A: um my second favorite thing i mean uh if i come across pool i watch it i don't [noise] necessarily have a 

142.36 148.80 A: second sport that that i would say i would [noise] you know there's no plan b. so to speak 

149.01 153.23 A: um baseball take it or leave it 

152.96 161.61 B: right i i'm a yeah i i don't watch that it's just a little boring for me i'd rather um go to the game and actually watch it 

161.93 168.19 B: um but for t._v. sports and then i i do um i do watch a little bit of um 

168.30 171.09 B: women's uh um softball 

170.82 171.66 A: (( uh mm )) 

171.71 175.87 B: um 'cause i used to play softball so i i get into that 

175.15 181.08 A: so you're like a like a you know you you bowled you played softball you're like an [sigh] what 

180.70 182.06 B: shot pool 

181.98 184.89 A: shot pool you're da- you're dangerous yeah [laughter] 

184.11 195.51 B: [laughter] and um now basketball is it like year round for you um then uh do you watch like the college playoffs and 

192.93 197.27 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] no i i will watch you know i guess i'm 

197.29 203.85 A: a superficial type guy i i watch the playoffs i watch uh my home team 

203.24 204.25 B: right 

204.00 208.29 A: um but there's not much to watch in the last few years [laughter] and um 

208.41 210.42 A: um i watch the um 

210.56 212.99 A: uh the women's league during the summer 

212.73 214.01 B: oh okay 

213.65 218.82 A: um i actually went to one of their games when they first started out three four years ago 

218.38 219.33 B: mhm 

219.17 220.86 A: and um [sigh] 

221.67 228.36 A: it it's oh ya i watched them during the the summer season so i have my basketball all the year round college 

228.38 231.43 A: basketball stuff like that i'm really not into it yeah 

231.35 234.95 B: okay so you're you're more the professional like i am 

235.50 246.67 B: um but then um because sports are on year round [sigh] um so after the football season um i probably watch um 

246.98 253.61 B: um highlights golfing some of the golfing highlights because i have my husband that's interested in that so i 

253.75 254.94 B: i do uh

258.05 259.23 B: um 

259.31 267.02 B: so then i probably am able to watch another coupla hours per week and it might vary sport to sport depending upon what what's 

267.42 269.37 B: what's on and what interests me 

268.95 272.00 A: [noise] [noise] i also watch my i don't know if uh 

272.36 277.44 A: uh the professional wrestling wrestling entertainment qualifies as a sport 

277.11 279.30 B: i think so yes 

278.64 281.72 A: i i watch um you know the um 

282.69 287.96 A: the fake wrestling so to speak uh the the w._w._e. and um

329.42 335.03 B: as i do uh many other sports i'd rather watch the i mean i'd rather be in the stadium or 

335.07 336.67 B: or that but uh 

337.19 338.04 B: okay 

337.33 340.54 A: so it doesn't compare really you you prefer the live

341.26 342.41 A: mhm 

342.77 346.42 A: i know the first time uh maybe because late in my development i 

346.47 348.93 A: the first time i actually went to a game 

349.72 353.05 A: it was such a different experience that i 

352.07 365.66 B: [lipsmack] oh yeah like basketball game you're right there you're right on the [sigh] bleachers or or there and you're cheering your team on and other people are so it gets quite exciting where at home you might be with a coup- a few people or something that are cheering 

365.68 367.62 B: but it's 

366.62 374.04 A: yeah it's it's it's different 'cause you know if um i spent most of my young age watching 

374.20 376.66 A: uh baseball or sports on t._v. 

376.68 380.18 A: so the first time i went to a stadium i was like oh my god 

380.86 386.86 A: it's a it's a whole different experience television makes baseball less exciting 

386.28 389.75 B: yeah if you can't be there it's it's uh it's uh
