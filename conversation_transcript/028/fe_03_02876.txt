65.41 70.98 A: and they had a blast they had so many things there for like um the families to do 

71.11 75.41 B: that's different and four dollars is only four dollars you know but 

74.52 83.73 A: right and they get paid nothing you know they i think they're allowed about i think it's three thousand a year is their max- uh three thousand a month maximum that they make 

76.86 77.71 B: (( yeah )) 

82.51 86.33 B: and that's what and that's what makes it fun it's not for money

98.48 99.31 B: uh 

101.97 105.90 A: um i guess i i'm stereotyping but they're they're always in trouble 

105.90 117.99 B: absolutely and people lose their families and their and their houses and their businesses over gambling on 'em and it's just an absolute nightmare as far as i'm concerned it's not fun any more [noise] 

112.08 113.20 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

117.99 125.18 A: and it's funny because whenever they do something wrong meaning the professional athletes it's just oh boys will be boys

144.22 148.77 B: um i think all that money they get goes to their brain cells and kills a few of 'em 

149.08 152.64 A: [laughter] pr- there's all i i agree wholeheartedly 

152.74 154.46 A: it's just it's amazing
