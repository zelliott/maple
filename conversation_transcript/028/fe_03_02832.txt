96.72 97.88 A: (( so i don't re- )) 

97.94 101.43 A: i don't really so is somebody monitoring this conversation 

101.36 115.65 B: i i know they're recording it so i know we've we've gotta stretch and just um you know something about professional sports i don't know how many hours do i watch a week i don't i don't really actually i'm on a television sabbatical 

104.41 105.44 A: okay 

115.84 119.42 B: so i haven't watched it in a long time yeah 

116.71 118.00 A: (( good for you )) 

119.59 126.48 A: and i don't watch it because a. i don't really like the idea of professional sports 

126.54 129.12 A: i'm okay on college sports i grew up 

129.46 142.60 A: with an overdose of sports my dad was on the a- l- on the athletic staff of a college team [lipsmack] and so i never saw him so sports sports was the anti christ in my life 

138.67 140.00 B: wow 

142.76 145.94 B: mm it's what was having dad be not at home 

142.89 144.08 A: (( [lipsmack] and )) 

145.28 155.24 A: yeah so it was it was always a thing that i was not gonna be into because it took my dad away but the other thing is there's there's something 

155.29 169.50 A: inherently wrong uh to me about professional sports because sports is making the most of body mind and spirit and the money takes away the spirit and these people abuse their bodies and do whatever it takes 

169.48 172.54 B: mm yeah 

170.32 171.33 A: you know 

171.71 183.37 A: i know that some of those guys and gals it gets them out of the projects it gets them a life it gets them to a place where they never been but but rarely is it a good balance intellectually 

183.55 186.92 A: spiritually and and with the body so 

186.97 190.51 A: you know they're making all this money and the teachers should be making the money 

190.92 199.86 B: god that's so i i love that you said that because that's one of the things i love when i do watch sports 'cause you know when when i watch it like when i watch basketball 

191.53 192.61 A: you know 

199.72 209.23 B: um you know i'm not saying all the crap that goes on behind and all the you know politics of it and all the money and the arguing and the girls too you know 

208.89 209.86 A: mhm 

209.02 223.40 B: are like y- you know i have five babies for ya and all that stuff i'm just seeing exactly what you said about the mind body and spirit about especially with figure skating with all that training over however many years and then just one shot or two shots to hit it you know 

218.70 219.44 A: (( mm )) 

223.04 224.15 A: mhm 

223.52 233.71 B: um just that testing of mind body and spirit at the same time and and its spirit is so inspiring like the olympics so inspiring 

228.52 229.48 A: mhm 

232.58 236.98 A: now that's different i love the olympics because it is inspiring 

237.06 243.80 A: but once you throw commercialism into the pot it sorta just destructive i think for for for the whole 

243.84 248.57 A: [lipsmack] you know just the the spiritual side of it and i don't mean to be too much on the spiritual side but 

248.87 251.77 A: the money throws the whole gig off 

251.97 253.20 B: yeah 

253.11 256.39 A: you know and when i think of pro sports i think about pro 

256.37 269.25 A: uh football and pro baseball and pro basketball and and i hate pro football pro baseball is okay and pro basketball is not bad um and i i think of things in terms of that i don't automatically think about 

261.90 263.00 B: (( yeah me too )) 

269.25 274.55 A: you know professional swimmers or professional skaters or or the other more um 

274.66 275.90 A: fine sports 

276.29 279.29 A: um 'cause [mn] i live in the bay area 

279.23 280.03 B: uh-huh 

279.90 282.77 A: [lipsmack] and we have the raiders here 

282.96 288.93 A: and it is a very low end blue collar low class 

289.27 296.17 A: way of handling a professional sport it's that blood and guts it's really rough i'd be afraid to go to a game 

294.71 295.85 B: wow 

296.45 300.29 B: wow you mean the way that the fans deal with it 

298.79 301.79 A: yeah it's really really seedy 

302.27 306.39 B: wow are like are people betting and stuff or what do you mean 

305.57 312.56 A: well i i well you know they are the way they dress they're tacky they're drinking it's a very rough crowd 

312.23 313.81 B: (( mm [sigh] )) 

313.09 322.04 A: you know we have the forty niners and then we have the raiders and the forty niners isn't as rough it's just your typical professional football team but the raiders is really 

322.34 323.75 A: you know low brow 

324.02 327.61 A: in terms of its fan base and i'm thinking well [sigh] 

327.73 334.72 A: they're they're screaming for blood and guts they couldn't care less about you know any- anything more refined or intellectual about this 

334.76 337.94 A: and it is a business and it's an entertainment business 

338.59 342.51 A: so i guess really what we're talking about instead of professional sports is entertainment 

343.16 348.48 B: that's interesting that you say that because i was just thinking those people um 

349.28 360.87 B: [lipsmack] who in the stands it's like they get to have their aggression taken out okay cool um i'll be two minutes um they get to have their no no i'm actually at an appointment i'm getting my eyebrows done 

356.19 357.37 A: are you at work 

361.09 362.95 A: you're getting your eyebrows done 

361.36 362.39 B: [laughter] 

362.44 363.68 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

363.39 365.58 A: (( [laughter] good for you )) 

365.46 375.54 B: right um but uh it's amazing because it's like those people on the stands are like you know they're getting out all their aggression about work or their wives or their husbands or whatever 

367.44 368.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

374.52 375.48 A: (( mhm )) 

375.62 380.20 B: through this game and like for instance um do you ever watch uh 

380.48 381.62 B: (( [lipsmack] boxing )) 

381.68 383.08 A: [sigh] i don't 

383.38 392.73 B: okay yeah that's the worst oh my god i mean it's like you get in the ring and you just know the intention is to beat the crap out of each other 

392.31 393.48 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

392.89 396.00 B: you know what i mean it's like what you said about um 

396.51 409.37 B: the aggression and what you said about the entertainment of it it's like that is so not entertaining to me there's nothing beautiful or artistic about it i don't feel i mean i know's there's skill involved but not anything that i can really appreciate 

409.23 412.06 B: on an artistic level you know what i mean 

410.67 411.54 A: (( hm )) 

411.84 412.94 A: mhm 

412.79 414.25 B: it's just um 

413.08 419.37 A: but you did something of of value there in terms of the value of a professional sport 

419.50 426.35 A: if these people need to get their aggression out in the stands versus with each other or in their life that they have a lot of aggression 

426.65 429.49 A: well that's not a bad place to be 

429.53 430.38 B: huh 

430.22 436.75 A: you know because if they get their aggression out there as opposed to at home or in the streets or you know with each other 

437.87 445.86 A: i mean you brought up a point i never even thought about [lipsmack] i know my dad's eighty three and he sits in a chair and watches sports all day long 

440.68 442.28 B: (( wow so it's like [sigh] )) 

445.82 457.36 A: and he's yelling at the t._v. set and then when he gets off he's pretty calm and cool so i'm sure he's frustrated that he had a stroke and he's got problems and he's yelling at the t._v. set but then to your point 

458.11 459.16 A: maybe that's 

458.26 460.14 B: it's just a t._v. set 

459.61 461.76 A: well he's well he's getting his aggression out 

462.61 466.32 A: so maybe tha- maybe that's a good thing [laughter] 

465.58 469.57 B: yeah wow that was a good a going point i mean um 

469.71 471.76 B: what you were saying about 

471.89 475.26 B: that that uh you know they're not gonna 

475.43 483.99 B: if they can then take it out just in that moment you know what i mean it's like all false it's all games it's all it doesn't mean anything um 

479.15 480.09 A: uh-huh 

483.80 492.31 B: then maybe their wives are a little bit safer or their kids get uh you know actually have dad be in a good mood or whatever it is 

491.86 495.72 A: uh-huh interesting i thank you for bringing that up 

493.46 494.40 B: so
