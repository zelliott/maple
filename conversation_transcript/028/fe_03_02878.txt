159.30 160.52 B: i know 

160.91 169.25 B: i know i don't really watch much of it either and you know like sports i think that would be a good for at least to my situation a guy my husband you know 

168.57 178.41 A: [sigh] yeah yeah or i don't know just even women who don't have don't have kids because it's not even so much that i don't watch sports it's that i don't have time to watch t._v. 

178.34 179.49 B: (( the yeah y- )) 

178.86 182.90 A: in general i just [sigh] don't have time to do it do things 

182.42 194.51 B: yeah i have two boys also which they're getting you know older but it's still hard to you know you're constantly on them trying to get them to do their chores and homework and that sort of stuff 

194.11 196.18 A: yeah uh how old are your sons 

195.59 200.47 B: [noise] [sigh] um my youngest is getting ready to turn seven and then my oldest is ten 

200.35 203.20 A: oh okay does it get easier [laughter] 

201.59 202.39 B: so 

203.02 207.63 B: um a little bit but i don't know i mean it got 

207.69 216.66 B: it's the different stages like we've gone through the tattling stage which was fun and you know they're buddies but they still fight yeah 

214.47 216.14 A: (( mm fight yeah yeah )) 

217.27 218.24 B: so 

218.89 222.19 B: yeah hopefully it won't be it'll get easier 

219.31 220.10 A: (( so )) 

221.10 226.42 A: i just have the one but he's constantly just on top of me he's just constantly wanting 

225.51 227.55 B: you said he's one though right 

227.03 230.52 A: yeah he's one well actually he'll be two he'll be two in july 

230.25 231.41 B: oh okay 

230.94 233.14 A: yeah so 

231.97 234.29 B: still those terrible threes 

234.54 236.93 A: yeah [laughter] 

234.86 236.42 B: they're coming soon 

236.44 244.18 B: i was gonna say my boys it wasn't three it was like two and then my older son it was like h- him probably about four or five 

245.21 246.14 B: so 

246.05 248.32 A: when they when they went through the the stage 

247.52 249.45 B: yeah through the terrible twos 

248.84 256.22 A: oh oh you know he's not he's really not bad he's really a good natured little guy but he's just [sigh] so um [lipsmack] 

256.52 263.59 A: i don't know if i want to say dependent on me but he he just constantly wants my attention i guess that's probably normal but 

262.54 263.29 B: yeah 

263.67 269.76 A: it just makes it really hard to get anything done and it's just like you know watching t._v. what's what's that that's 

269.28 270.24 B: yeah 

269.90 272.43 A: [laughter] like part of my old life [laughter] 

271.96 274.41 B: i know i know uh yeah 

273.24 275.12 A: not part of my current life mhm 

274.78 278.43 B: yeah i know they love to sit down and play and [sigh] 

278.67 282.48 B: do lots of stuff like that take all your attention 

282.38 288.88 A: they do and it's funny because i i never really thought of my family as being really um 

289.35 291.92 A: necessarily really traditional 

291.50 292.62 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

291.93 294.19 A: but um i i'm the oldest of eight 

294.15 295.29 B: oh wow 

294.21 296.82 A: 'cause i have five brothers and two sisters 

296.77 306.71 A: and it's funny though because my sister and i were talking about it and it's like as we're getting older we're getting more into like those traditional roles in the family 'cause we get together probably like uh 

306.56 316.04 A: [lipsmack] every other month for we still celebrate birthdays and holidays most yeah most of us live pretty close [lipsmack] pretty close um [sigh] and 

309.54 310.93 B: oh that's good 

316.21 321.96 A: um the funny thing is is that my brothers and my dad are really into sports 

321.80 322.71 B: uh-huh 

322.17 326.53 A: and so what will generally happen is most of the guys will 

326.96 328.15 A: [lipsmack] um 

328.29 333.16 A: will be watching sports like almost the whole time especially if it's uh football season 

332.84 334.15 B: oh definitely 

333.50 335.70 A: yeah and the 

336.06 342.93 A: women or the girls are kind of either socializing or getting food done or or uh 

337.76 339.07 B: (( [cough] [cough] [mn] )) 

343.18 344.96 A: you know that type of thing 

344.22 345.93 B: messing with the kids 

345.25 351.33 A: that's yeah that's so much like it and it's funny 'cause i just i just never really thought that we would be like this 

346.71 347.82 B: [laughter] 

350.81 351.60 B: yeah 

351.39 363.18 A: um because when we were growing up and the girls were just as much into the sports and all that as as the boys were in fact my one sister was really really good in um volleyball basketball 

354.84 355.93 B: (( sports [mn] [sigh] )) 

363.19 366.65 A: hockey i mean she got probably as much attention as um 

366.66 376.75 A: [lipsmack] as the boys did and then i had another sister who was like you know head cheerleader and she was really athletic in that way in like the tumbling and [sigh] you know that type of stuff [cough] 

376.12 377.22 B: right 

376.54 386.36 A: that cheerleaders do [sigh] but um but now it's just like and it kind of bugs me but that's just the way it is you know it's like the guys will just automatically find the t._v. and 

382.42 383.70 B: (( right [noise] [lipsmack] )) 

386.30 392.70 A: turn it on and we sometimes will have to say when it's time to eat or when it's time to open presents like okay we're turning off the t._v. 

392.24 393.17 B: yeah 

392.80 394.09 A: you know [laughter] 

393.64 395.47 B: treat 'em like kids 

395.24 402.26 A: yeah [laughter] exactly like every game is not the superbowl it's not i mean i wouldn't do it during the superbowl but [sigh] [mn] 

396.08 398.19 B: yeah yeah 

403.04 410.87 A: just a r- random run of the mill game you know sometimes it these guys are kind of ridiculous it's like as if like life and death is 

411.57 412.49 B: right 

411.71 415.97 A: hinging on it and [sigh] you know it really doesn't hinge on it so 

415.87 429.50 B: [noise] yeah now see we do um [noise] some soccer my kids um are in soccer and then actually they're getting ready to start up bowling but as far as watching but soccer is neat to watch um the younger kids play 

416.64 417.56 A: sometimes 

424.47 425.19 A: (( mm )) 

429.05 430.22 A: mhm 

429.60 442.69 B: it is so cool because they're trying [sigh] you know they're trying to learn it all and it's just it's so cool though you know they're trying to um [sigh] you know work together as a team and learning how to pass it and 

442.08 443.51 A: and that's great to learn 

443.20 453.37 B: it it really is although my younger one's learning that um last year [sigh] you know you weren't allowed to touch the ball well now that you know he's been through this is his second year 

444.38 445.17 A: and 

453.17 460.78 B: you know now you can grab the ball and you know drop kick it or do whatever if you're goalie and you know the rules have changed 

456.72 458.17 A: oh right 

458.36 459.24 A: right 

461.65 462.97 B: a little bit 

461.77 472.85 A: right well well soccer's good because i guess um [sigh] it doesn't so much rely on just your physical size the younger kids or the or the smaller kids maybe have as much of a chance as 

472.90 487.12 B: actually he has um he's actually one of the biggest kids on his team and [sigh] there's a kid who is probably half the size of him and this kid is fearless he is so good and it's just incredible to watch him 

473.56 474.89 A: bigger kids mhm 

486.57 487.73 A: mhm 

487.11 495.48 B: he's so fast and you know he doesn't care he'll go r- you know butting heads right up against the bigger kids oh my gosh yes awesome to watch 

492.11 493.44 A: oh really 

493.72 505.96 A: [laughter] well i guess you know in some situations maybe smaller kids have an advantage they might be a little bit lighter a little bit faster in in it whereas in other sports i mean when i when i was growing up it was you know the bigger kids were definitely 

499.87 500.91 B: right 

506.29 511.70 A: at the advantage in you know basketball and football and those type of sports and now soccer has become so 

507.31 508.27 B: right 

511.72 513.39 A: um popular 

513.09 514.52 B: yeah it has 

513.43 520.77 A: for for kids that um but that's that's great though that at an early age they don't have to focus on oh on 

521.05 522.55 A: smallest one or 

521.21 521.87 B: it 

522.21 530.44 B: right well and it's funny we've noticed with my older son that it's so competitive the kids are so competitive at the you know older age 

529.75 531.55 A: even at like age seven [noise] 

531.39 542.53 B: [lipsmack] um no not at my seven year old hasn't noticed that that much but my ten year old it his team i mean it's like all just competitive we have to win we have to win and 

541.30 542.53 A: oh really mm 

542.44 554.78 B: oh yeah the coach um like even during practise he'll divide the kids and the team that doesn't win he'll make 'em do pushups and you know run the whole field and it's just crazy you know and i 

553.90 557.12 A: is it to the point where your son stresses out over it or 

557.07 558.62 B: [sigh] um 

557.97 559.58 A: or in a healthy way 

559.73 561.04 B: [sigh] 

560.48 562.56 A: just to encourage them to do their best 

561.91 568.82 B: well i don't know i he i think he stresses a little bit about it yeah but um no see my younger one 

565.17 566.05 A: (( really mhm )) 

568.75 581.18 B: it's not like that um we really like it you know with him because you know it's not so demanding and you know it's not you know about who wins or who loses it's about you know the kids going out there and having fun 

580.65 582.60 A: right right 

581.64 585.22 B: [lipsmack] so and i think that's how it should be but [noise] 

585.30 586.24 B: oh well 

586.07 595.50 A: well i think sometimes too the parents and the coaches can [cough] throw a little bit too much of that competitiveness it maybe some ki- times kind of their egos get 

588.02 589.07 B: mhm 

592.43 593.33 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

595.85 597.14 B: oh definitely 

596.42 599.89 A: in the way and and um maybe they forget a little bit about
