325.44 331.10 B: they well they pay the players like millions and millions of dollars and 

330.17 339.37 A: this is what i'm talking about you know i can remember one year i think it was the um i don't know whether it was the braves or [noise] one of these teams [noise] um 

331.80 332.83 B: (( you know )) 

339.71 341.38 A: i think it was the 

341.67 344.87 A: what was it the braves is one year this was in the 

345.39 353.81 A: in the l- late eighties remember when they when they came up with this thing about one team wanted they was talking about some kind of um um 

354.16 357.22 A: [lipsmack] uh what you call it uh um pension 

357.65 364.89 A: pension plan they were going to stop playing because they wanted a [noise] to guarantee them some kind of pension you remember that [noise] do you remember something about that 

362.62 366.72 B: oh e- i yeah they went on strike or they were talking of 

365.64 372.08 A: went on strike that's right because the pension it was much money as they are making you can create your own pension

398.05 399.17 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

401.44 403.18 B: yeah 

402.83 407.38 A: but uh that that just boils down to the more you get the more you want [noise] 

407.06 408.11 B: yep 

408.44 412.14 A: that's it they don't know how to take what they have and use it
