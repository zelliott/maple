64.34 65.60 B: mhm 

65.27 70.87 A: um they over the past probably five five or ten years they've been pretty bad though so it's kinda hard to move on [noise]

98.37 99.94 A: [noise] oh yeah i like football a lot too 

100.07 106.41 A: [noise] um i'm not i'm not the kind of person who is planting myself in front of the t._v. on a sunday afternoon though that's 

105.65 113.66 B: yeah no me either well for if for a phillies game yes yes i mean i just was brought up that way it was sort of mandatory in my house 

109.28 110.17 A: (( right )) 

113.20 114.50 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

113.90 116.30 B: that's what we had to watch um 

115.50 121.08 A: [noise] it's kind of surprising to hear someone who can actually sit through a whole uh baseball some people think it's boring 

119.79 123.66 B: oh see that's where you're wrong because it's not 

122.44 125.87 A: [noise] well no i uh i actually like it on to watch it on t._v. but [noise] 

125.65 131.35 B: yeah but it's not it's not as boring as everyone thinks everyone thinks baseball is so boring and it's not 

125.90 127.62 A: some people complain [noise] 

128.85 129.66 A: yeah 

130.97 132.69 A: yeah i agree [noise] [noise] 

131.83 143.38 B: if you understand the game that's the that's the thing [noise] um i mean it's just not as uh you know constant constant movement like with a basketball game or a 

133.34 134.30 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

143.47 146.05 B: um hockey game or something like that 

145.63 148.78 A: yeah [noise] there was some there's some um [noise] 

146.72 147.97 B: but uh 

148.92 160.13 A: some people who wanna speed up the game a little bit they say that the the baseball players take all but too long in the batter's box you know adjusting their um their batter's gloves and [laughter] [noise] 

157.53 167.10 B: oh my god well wouldn't you if you were gonna stand in front of uh eighty thousand people and you had to hit something that was coming in at a hundred miles an hour i'd be taking my time too 

162.45 163.56 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

165.60 166.66 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

166.79 173.41 A: i guess i would too but um [noise] like [noise] i guess it's it's even sportscasters who say that it takes too long and they they 

168.27 170.04 B: my god 

172.61 173.78 B: really 

173.44 177.80 A: the game really should only take about two hours but sometimes it takes you know two and half or three hours 

176.90 184.45 B: oh well that's just our [noise] a._d._d. society and not being able to deal with it 'cause i think i think football is actually slower 

180.32 181.89 A: (( [noise] yeah [laughter] )) 

184.55 186.01 A: (( [noise] really [noise] [noise] )) 

185.04 190.16 B: yeah because they move for you know what four seconds and they stop and stand around and talk about it 

187.47 188.24 A: (( [noise] )) 

189.68 191.60 A: [noise] [noise] well that's true yeah 

191.02 196.75 B: [noise] so i think you know g- go- i i find football more boring to watch than baseball actually [noise] [noise] [noise] 

196.07 200.74 A: yeah the football game is only an hour but then the the whole broadcast lasts three hours usually 

200.12 202.44 B: exactly exactly 

202.49 213.49 B: um i mean it's funny because what my dad used to do when we were growing up and because his favorite announcer was harry kallis you know he was just you know famous for being one of the best announcers and 

209.72 210.66 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

213.06 214.34 A: yeah 

213.81 217.86 B: when we watched the games on god do you remember prism [laughter] do you 

217.77 219.58 A: no [laughter] 

218.30 220.02 B: remember the cable show how old are you 

219.89 221.21 A: i'm twenty eight 

221.31 227.50 B: well okay you're about my age so that well there there was this um cable network called prism back in the day 

223.87 224.71 A: okay 

226.53 228.06 A: uh-huh okay 

227.54 238.97 B: and they broadcast all the phillies games and but their announcers were awful so my dad used to turn the sound down and then put on the radio so we could hear harry kallis and the commercials were never in sync and it was just oh huh it 

234.35 235.79 A: (( oh yeah yeah )) 

238.28 239.64 A: [laughter] 

239.16 241.05 B: was bad but um 

240.28 245.52 A: that's like the people who who sit in the stands and then and the have the all listen to headphones for 

244.58 246.34 B: yeah yeah yeah 

245.73 247.00 A: listening to the radio 

246.71 251.05 B: but you know if you're a hardcore fan the announcers do um [lipsmack] 

251.17 253.82 B: you know have a lot to do with your enjoyment of the game 

253.52 254.73 A: yeah that's true 

254.35 268.66 B: oh 'cause some people just they you know they uh like with baseball for example they they you know will pretend like it's gonna be a home run when obviously to another announcer it would just be an out and how everyone feels [noise] but uh now some 

264.37 265.15 A: yeah 

268.33 270.06 A: have you been to any lakers games 

270.16 275.93 B: [lipsmack] you know what i haven't because the tickets are outrageously expensive and they're so hard to get out here 

275.61 277.07 A: really even 

276.07 286.40 B: yeah they're you know 'cause they play at the stable centre an- and i mean uh you know all that uh it's yeah it's really hard to get lakers tickets actually i i have a couple of friends who are clippers fans 

278.51 279.44 A: (( right [noise] )) 

286.48 291.43 B: um and have seasons tickets to the clippers i don't you know 'cause i don't think anyone goes to those games but 

291.07 292.07 A: yeah 

291.54 292.65 B: um 

292.69 295.92 B: yeah lakers are har- much harder to get tickets to i think 

295.72 297.81 A: [noise] do they show all the games on t._v. 

297.43 302.97 B: yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah especially right now you know it's just i'm still 

302.14 305.69 A: and how are they doing i i've lost track of in this in the play offs 

305.43 317.79 B: [mn] yeah i mean i guess they're doing all right like i said i'm more of a baseball fan so i kinda you know i will you know if everyone's like oh we're going out to watch the hockey uh the the the basketball game i'll go to it but i haven't been following it i have to admit 

309.42 310.21 A: yeah 

317.25 318.68 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

317.84 326.06 B: [lipsmack] um but uh yeah have you have you seen did you do you go see the orioles often or 

325.10 328.67 A: um usually about three or four times during the summer 

328.60 330.04 B: oh that's not bad 

329.70 332.79 A: no it's it's only about a um forty five minutes away 

332.74 333.67 B: yeah 

332.97 344.05 A: and and usually it's not crowded um it's it's nice on saturday afternoons to go out there and 'cause even if they're losing you know you kinda have a an enjoyable day without without worrying about the game itself 

337.09 338.08 B: mhm 

341.47 342.49 B: definitely 

343.63 346.36 B: yeah god it's been ages since i've been to baltimore 

346.26 347.23 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

346.72 350.24 B: yeah it's been ages yeah i went to university of delaware so i was um 

349.63 350.88 A: (( okay [noise] )) 

350.28 354.68 B: you know pretty close to that area but uh it's been a while since i've been to baltimore 

354.00 357.07 A: [noise] what was the soccer game that you went to the pro game 

356.27 358.79 B: uh the wizards game 

359.10 359.94 A: okay 

359.64 366.55 B: yeah it was ages ago it was ages ago but i liked it i mean it's a you know it was kinda scary going to um 

366.63 379.51 B: a live soccer game [laughter] 'cause you got all these angry europeans [noise] you know all over the place but um because they were hard core they were really into it and you're just wondering if a riot's gonna start at any second [lipsmack] [noise] 

370.57 372.48 A: [noise] oh yes [laughter] 

374.10 374.93 A: yeah 

378.75 382.86 A: well sometimes i see games from either latin america or um 

382.85 395.90 A: sometimes from europe on t._v. and you'll see these fires just breaking out in the stands where fans either for they're happy that the team's up or they're sad their team's losing and they just set a fire in the middle of the bleachers [laughter] 

387.72 388.70 B: yeah 

393.94 395.10 B: [laughter] 

395.36 399.57 B: a- as would be the normal reaction sure yeah just set something on fire 

397.36 407.32 A: of course and it's y- y- you can't really tell sometimes it's the home team that you know the fans are setting the fires and see then they'll clear out an area around the fire and throw 

407.39 412.42 A: chairs and whatever into it just have a huge bonfire up in the middle of these concrete stands 

411.94 413.66 B: [laughter] oh my god 

412.70 419.54 A: and it's just ridiculous so then the- there's this big cloud of smoke that hangs over the field and the players are coughing and it's just like [laughter] 

418.91 422.36 B: oh my god worse than hockey fans 

420.53 421.63 A: it's kinda crazy 

422.03 423.90 A: yeah 

423.19 424.94 B: geez whiz but 

425.01 432.65 A: but um so so i'm a little bit afraid i i would i would be afraid to go to um say central america or something to see a game because 

432.36 433.32 B: yeah 

432.69 434.91 A: y- you hear about riots and all these things but 

434.35 443.50 B: yeah yeah and they're all used to it and we'd kind of be like okay what are the rules [laughter] like what can i set on fire what can't i set on fire 

438.21 439.02 A: yeah 

443.29 444.45 A: yeah 

443.89 446.77 B: yeah that'd be kinda hard [lipsmack] um 

445.71 447.51 A: (( do you ever go to see hockey out there )) 

447.35 453.49 B: i have not seen a hockey game out here the last time i went to a hockey game uh my parents used to live in toronto and 

452.73 454.12 A: mhm 

453.52 457.69 B: um i went to go see a maple leaf's rangers game 

457.43 458.22 A: okay 

457.75 462.79 B: which was great and it was the first time i'd ever sat up in one of the uh little boxes 

462.71 463.73 A: (( oh yeah )) 

463.19 466.06 B: the little you know like we're special people boxes and 

465.41 466.82 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

466.10 473.13 B: um yeah it was friends of the family had had tickets and that was an ama- 'cause y- you know i think with hockey you either have to sit 

473.73 475.92 B: right on the ground 

475.77 477.72 A: yeah right against glass [noise] 

476.30 484.77 B: or from one of the boxes because it really is amazing i mean you can see you know where the puck is going and and and what's going on 

484.48 485.58 A: yeah 

484.95 489.41 B: but um [lipsmack] so that was kinda cool uh do you do you go to hockey games in your area 

489.12 492.47 A: yeah um usually about once a year i'll go to a cats game 

492.06 493.02 B: mhm 

492.77 506.23 A: and it was kind of exciting a couple of years ago when we got ye- um yarmia yarger from from pittsburgh but i- um i dunno the cats really haven't done much since he's been here there's a lot of hype with him but it hasn't really panned out so well 

501.92 502.88 B: (( mhm no )) 

506.00 506.92 B: (( mm )) 

506.26 519.54 A: [noise] but but i enjoy it i mean i i like watching it on t._v. too and and i'm getting all the better i i i grew up in kind of a rural area so i didn't really didn't really have hockey um just about three hours south of here near uh richmond 

515.39 516.42 B: where's that

581.96 583.93 A: yeah i think they built a new one [noise] [noise] 

583.14 592.85 B: yeah which you know i guess is a good thing 'cause it was kind of a crap hole but still i just you know i've i don't it'd be strange to drive up ninety five and not see 

586.58 587.16 A: (( [noise] )) 

587.18 587.96 A: [laughter] 

588.08 588.67 A: (( [noise] ))
