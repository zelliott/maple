72.66 73.87 A: oh yeah 

73.23 77.62 B: so um that was a lot of fun and i like to watch them play on television but 

78.03 81.59 B: (( um if they're not playing i don't really care about it [laughter] )) 

80.08 89.62 A: yeah that's yeah well i i really like to [mn] i like to go to the games better than i do to watch them on t._v. because there's so much more to be experienced but um 

86.20 87.61 B: (( oh yeah [laughter] )) 

88.57 89.42 B: uh-huh 

89.50 93.05 B: yes i did and if i get to go to a game i wouldn't i would go 

92.60 96.62 A: oh yeah yeah i'll go to almost anything [laughter] 

93.44 96.46 B: any kind of game [laughter] hm 

96.51 110.99 A: i'm not a big baseball fan although i grew up my grandad just watched t._v. watched baseball on t._v. all the time and so i kind of grew up watching t._v. you know watching baseball with him and and my husband watches a lot and and uh 

111.07 117.96 A: uh we'd go to the games here sometimes too so i guess i like major league baseball it's just it's so slow it seems 

117.51 119.22 B: (( yeah 'cause 'em )) 

119.20 122.16 B: i learned a lot about it um when i was 

122.06 136.81 B: younger in my early twenties um there was a guy that i was dating and he was into baseball in in school in high school and in college and also in softball and um so i learned a lot about it and i became a scorer 

129.33 130.22 A: uh-huh 

136.75 140.88 B: and actually got paid to keep score and so in order to do that i had to 

140.47 146.88 A: you had to know what was going on yeah i used to keep score for softball so yeah i know i know that too i i 

141.63 144.46 B: yeah [laughter] and uh i just went to 

146.18 147.13 B: mhm 

147.11 152.12 A: had to sort of you had to know what was a hit and what was an error and [laughter] yeah 

150.58 165.38 B: right and know that whether they were pitcher did they have caught that ball or was it impossible for them to catch you know caught [laughter] [laughter] sometimes they didn't agree with you [laughter] but um because i liked him i went to a lot of the games to watch him play and that's how i got interested 

154.83 157.98 A: yeah yeah [laughter] exactly 

158.47 160.16 A: yes [laughter] 

163.73 164.98 A: oh sure 

165.08 166.05 A: yeah 

165.26 167.98 B: and then um when he got outta 

168.12 176.60 B: school and wasn't playing baseball anymore then he started playing softball and he'd even go to the big um tournaments and things like that and um 

175.19 176.49 A: oh wow 

176.67 183.70 B: so and that's how i got to keep score so i think that's why i still like to watch baseball although i've forgotten a lot of it [laughter] 

178.53 179.46 A: yeah 

182.95 191.33 A: i know yeah well when i go to the baseball game um we're we have the rangers and when i go out i always insist we buy a 

188.15 188.94 B: (( mhm )) 

191.40 199.92 A: book you know because i do keep a score i mean just it makes me pay attention to the game otherwise i'd wander you know and i'm not paying any attention so 

192.32 193.14 B: mhm 

194.01 194.97 B: uh-huh 

196.14 197.14 B: right 

197.38 198.94 B: you'd start looking at 

199.03 201.92 B: yeah what other people are doing and [laughter] 

200.67 207.37 A: yeah yeah look around so i i usually do just keep score just for myself you know 

202.56 203.56 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

207.02 207.76 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

207.65 215.94 A: so um i enjoy that one one game i don't like and i don't like to watch though is basketball i just [lipsmack] 

215.23 216.24 B: yeah 

216.02 222.91 A: and i don't i sometimes i've gone to games sometimes and they're pretty good but i just don't like it on t._v. 

220.24 225.55 B: mhm it's it's kinda hard to watch on television and i think it's a lot more interesting if you can go to the 

225.31 226.35 A: yeah 

225.69 227.20 B: uh tournament and you can 

227.39 233.03 B: see you know the whole court and what's going on better than you can on television 

229.71 230.88 A: yes 

232.67 234.93 A: yeah basketball's just never 

235.26 239.22 A: (( gotten to me [laughter] i don't know [laughter] ))

253.11 255.33 A: oh well that's a good deal 

253.85 263.71 B: so [cough] [laughter] yes but i felt well i'll go down here and see what hockey's about because it was something i never lived anywhere close to where you could go to a hockey game

295.88 297.13 A: yes 

297.64 308.45 A: oh i can't even stand up on on skates so to watch them skate like they do and so fast and backwards and sideways and crash into each other it's amazing to me [laughter]

344.40 346.88 A: yeah any day [laughter] 

345.35 358.56 B: [laughter] oh but it's it's just that we have so many golf courses in this area and that's what so many people come here to either to watch or play or they come here to live so they can play here and [cough] but 

350.67 352.11 A: oh yeah
