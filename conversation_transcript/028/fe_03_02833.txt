123.77 125.55 B: (( [noise] [noise] wait so you're in philadelphia )) 

125.66 126.72 A: what's that 

126.21 127.77 B: are you you in philadelphia 

127.51 129.54 A: yeah i live in sienna city 

129.33 130.27 B: okay 

130.21 131.43 A: yeah 

130.80 135.37 B: can we stray away from the conversation 'cause i s- i'm kinda [noise] interested in moving to philadelphia 

135.38 137.79 A: oh really [laughter] sure 

135.96 139.09 B: yeah and and and within a year or something 

139.00 146.20 A: sure well it's really hard for us to talk about sports on t._v. since neither of us watch t._v. and neither of us really watch sports [laughter] 

145.00 151.74 B: [noise] [noise] okay well i wanna say also that i think it's a huge industry i don't do they record this i don't even understand how this stuff works 

151.47 156.59 A: yeah i think i think well [noise] i think what it is incidentally is just a study to um 

156.74 162.83 A: [noise] to uh kind of see how people speak [noise] i guess speak speech patterns on telephone 

162.62 163.78 B: (( [lipsmack] oh okay )) 

163.80 174.64 A: so then i don't think they mind if we talk about this stuff because i think [noise] they're just recording um way the way that we talk you know and and talking about sports just gets people to talk to 

168.42 169.80 B: (( [noise] throughout the whole )) 

170.81 172.36 B: oh i see oh okay 

175.00 177.43 A: oh i mean whatever the topic is i guess you know 

176.93 178.90 B: i guess i could yeah i guess on something
