81.72 82.31 B: (( [noise] )) 

81.95 84.06 A: definitely definitely 

84.62 88.60 A: yeah i don't i don't know i'm just not a sports person in general 

89.06 90.39 B: yeah 

89.75 91.62 A: yeah so i mean 

90.71 93.42 B: (( i would definitely agree with that )) 

92.36 98.19 A: yeah i mean there's always like sports on like my you know my dad watches sports all the time and 

98.52 100.32 A: [sigh] is you know really into

109.16 113.08 B: yeah no i i i definitely understand that i mean 

113.13 124.14 B: it you i i watch very little t._v. anyway i mean you know usually if i've time to veg out it's in front of a computer not in front of a tv 

117.26 118.22 A: mhm 

123.97 133.85 A: exactly exactly there there there are definitely better things to do than just than just you know hours of television and like sports just goes on forever you know 

127.94 130.00 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

133.13 135.07 B: i know i know i mean 

135.27 138.57 B: you know how how many hours just for one game 

137.78 143.45 A: exactly it's like three hours you know four hours you can't just watch like half an hour then you know 

143.64 145.02 A: (( that's it you know )) 

143.65 145.50 B: right 

145.69 151.34 B: well see that that's kind of a thing about basketball because it's not so much about who wins like the 

150.36 151.21 A: right 

151.36 158.99 B: um you know you you can you can kinda just turn it on and watch for fifteen minutes and like see some really cool things go on 

158.70 163.11 A: yeah i agree i mean i've done that with with basketball like just seeing 

162.06 165.91 B: but i mean there's no point to doing that with any other sport i don't think 

164.40 172.33 A: no because 'cause there's not that much like action going on you can sit there for like fifteen minutes waiting for someone to like hit a ball in baseball you know 

171.26 178.09 B: exactly exactly [laughter] i mean you [mn] i i i don't have the time and patience for that 

177.07 181.99 A: exactly how much do you need to know about the wind direction while they're trying to like hit a ball 

180.53 182.92 B: (( [laughter] )) 

182.05 196.39 A: it's unnecessary it's completely unnecessary but yeah with with basketball i mean the action's really fast so so you can catch something really good and just watch it for fifteen minutes and then it's a commercial and you're like okay well that's i needed to see of that 

184.01 184.57 B: (( [mn] )) 

188.18 189.23 B: right 

196.28 198.34 B: (( exactly )) 

196.99 199.41 A: yeah yeah definitely 

199.95 206.59 A: so yeah if i'd watch anything it would probably be basketball like if if i had to pick a sport to watch you 

206.26 209.34 B: yeah yeah um 

211.89 212.82 B: (( mm )) 

212.68 213.58 A: (( know [laughter] )) 

216.86 217.94 B: i mean 

219.42 221.45 B: (( i don't know it's weird like )) 

221.71 227.77 B: as far as what channel i guess usually find that i'm random channels not like e._s._p._n. or one of those 

226.27 230.70 A: yeah yeah just like random randomly on t._v. 

230.61 235.25 B: yeah yeah like i mean i don't know 

231.82 232.68 A: yeah 

235.58 246.18 B: really much about the channels up here because i don't i watch even less t._v. up here than i did anywhere else [laughter] 'cause i've even less time but 

242.23 243.30 A: yeah 

246.47 247.82 B: um 

248.70 254.87 B: i know like down in miami [noise] the miami heat would just come on like in random times 

254.47 255.66 A: yeah 

255.06 255.62 B: (( [mn] )) 

255.86 257.44 A: (( yeah exactly i mean [sigh] )) 

258.44 260.35 A: (( you know it's like local networks )) 

260.45 262.30 B: yeah 

260.61 262.02 A: certain things [noise] 

262.09 264.53 A: are just played at certain times 

265.12 266.39 B: (( mhm )) 

266.24 267.26 B: um 

267.09 282.03 B: the the other cool thing i the other thing i i remember it wasn't so much television but i remember when i would go to a heat game and if i wanted to leave before all the craziness at the miami arena um 

274.48 275.91 A: (( and mhm )) 

280.63 281.47 A: mhm 

282.46 287.64 B: i'd leave like five or ten minutes early and catch the rest on a._m. radio 

287.14 292.28 A: yeah yeah exactly sometimes it i mean it's better to do that i mean 

292.41 298.97 A: you know if the game's not going really well or you know and there's going to be like a traffic nightmare you know 

296.46 297.74 B: yeah 

298.38 303.83 B: right i mean it's not like here where you just kind of hop on the line anyway 'cause there's nowhere to park but 

302.72 304.57 A: right [laughter] 

304.77 309.04 B: um down there everybody drives so [laughter] 

307.41 308.29 A: yeah 

309.14 316.64 A: yeah you just get like a a complete nightmare of traffic but that's how it is here i i i live round pittsburgh and uh 

316.43 317.75 B: (( oh okay )) 

317.27 320.39 A: yeah when when games let out in pittsburgh it's just 

321.07 323.94 A: it's unbelievable like traffic problems 

323.87 325.95 B: yeah 

325.17 333.33 A: and they always like schedule like other things to happen when there's a game on so there's like traffic from three other things happening at the same time 

333.16 334.77 B: oh are you serious 

333.91 343.28 A: yeah they just they do really really bizarre things like that there there'll be like a saint patrick's day parade and like a game and like 

343.35 346.46 A: like some convention and like 

346.72 350.03 A: symphony and then they all let out at the same time and then it's 

350.58 352.28 A: (( pandemonium [sigh] )) 

352.42 353.50 B: wow 

353.01 354.46 A: yeah [laughter] 

355.66 358.93 B: that is definitely craziness 

358.38 361.08 A: poor city planning [laughter] is what that is 

360.59 364.85 B: yeah yeah very true very true 

361.15 362.34 A: [laughter] 

363.32 365.54 A: yeah [laughter] 

367.08 368.40 B: oh wow 

369.49 374.87 B: yeah and and plus why would all those events want to compete with each other if somebody wanted to go to all of them 

373.82 377.06 A: exactly exactly what are you going to do like you're gonna like 

377.51 384.23 A: walk around and then think about this other thing while listening to the game on like headphones like it it'd just be 

381.83 382.99 B: right 

384.38 385.07 A: like 

385.22 386.94 A: a big conflict 

387.22 396.51 A: like it how like how do you choose you know if you're like average sports fan guy between like going to the saint patrick's day parade and you know 

387.43 388.38 B: (( but )) 

396.62 404.42 A: having fun there like going to a sporting event and having fun like how how would you [sigh] how would you reconcile that issue [laughter] 

398.09 399.18 B: right 

404.43 414.37 B: right oh the other funny thing i remember about wat- sports on t._v. is i remember i remember at the gator games in in florida 

409.55 410.33 A: what 

412.86 413.55 A: (( mm )) 

414.20 419.60 B: um people would actually bring their little pocket televisions to the game 

419.48 420.62 A: really 

420.32 421.42 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

421.83 426.00 A: see that's that's kinda weird that doesn't make any sense 

424.37 438.83 B: well well because you're sitting like out in you know row eighty eight or something and [laughter] and when they actually want to see what happened well i i guess you know there's also like you know the um 

429.90 430.83 A: right 

438.71 453.01 B: re- repeat repeat i forgot i forget what it's even called repeat motion or whatever instant replay that's it and it my brain's not working tonight [laughter] um yeah instant replay or you know the commentary or whatever 

442.76 444.44 A: (( instant replay )) 

444.77 445.72 A: yeah 

447.21 448.60 A: [laughter] that's okay 

452.80 453.92 B: um 

454.15 459.21 B: a lot of people would bring the little um the little portable t._v.s 

459.04 466.06 A: yeah yeah i guess i guess that would make sense because like you figure like a a you know a sporting event especially at like a 

466.14 476.04 A: i mean even if it's a college event i mean even if you know if it's a college that like it's you know it takes the sports really seriously you'd figure in the arena or the stadium there'd be you know 

475.98 481.78 A: screens everywhere you know so even if you weren't close enough you could see what was going on 

477.94 478.86 B: (( mhm )) 

481.80 484.08 A: even if you couldn't really see the court or whatever 

481.91 486.59 B: yeah no- no not there [laughter] 

485.13 487.52 A: no not there [laughter] 

486.90 490.98 B: and i swear it's a huge stadium down there 

490.83 492.01 A: yeah 

493.73 497.04 A: yeah a friend of mine goes to school in miami 

497.28 499.61 A: and it's it's just crazy 

499.59 501.92 B: oh yeah university of miami is 

502.01 503.51 B: crazy also 

503.02 505.56 A: yeah yeah he says it's just uh

553.64 554.70 A: lots of 

556.52 558.59 A: (( yeah yeah there's a )) 

559.09 566.58 A: lot of there's a lot of like just like regional parts of the country where it's like sports are just extremely important
