157.32 158.91 B: it's sorta funny 

159.14 170.99 B: and then you know [noise] a- and it's so funny actually professional sports on t._v. it's like how much people are getting paid and how big a part of american culture it is 

170.04 172.26 A: [noise] oh yeah that's true 

172.60 173.93 B: i think 

173.04 174.57 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

174.46 175.72 B: it's uh 

176.70 178.95 B: had such a huge 

179.58 185.29 B: it's such a huge part and how people get so involved in their team whether their team's winning and 

185.05 194.97 B: and you know i mean when it doesn't really make a difference to anything what team wins or what team is better and they just right right you know 

189.03 193.28 A: [noise] oh yeah when they put the flags on their car [laughter] 

194.22 196.75 A: yeah that's true 

195.51 196.07 B: (( [mn] )) 

196.20 204.72 B: and they make such a huge deal out of it and you know when you see with the lakers i mean such a big deal whether they win or not 

202.79 204.04 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

205.10 211.47 B: you know riots when the lakers win that's bizarre [laughter] right 

205.11 206.44 A: yeah 

207.60 212.97 A: yeah i know you'd think they'd be excited not [laughter] do all that kind of stuff 

212.73 214.20 B: (( [mn] right )) 

214.05 215.86 A: yeah 

215.38 217.57 B: and how you know uh sports 

217.98 219.49 B: celebrities you 

220.19 226.11 B: know are seen in such high esteem and of course they're talented but it's interesting 

220.55 221.79 A: yeah 

225.03 227.72 A: yeah [laughter] that's true 

227.90 232.70 B: [noise] it is interesting then the amount of money that goes into 

233.75 238.85 B: marketing and commercials for the big events and 

237.98 239.51 A: yeah 

239.21 241.89 B: how much time that must take up 

240.10 242.43 A: how much it costs when you got eat there 

242.62 244.11 B: right [laughter] 

243.68 245.36 A: [noise] it's kinda ridiculous [laughter] 

244.31 257.93 B: oh yeah right at a stadium right yeah i went to the dodgers' game the other day and it's like you know [mn] i must have spent twenty dollars just on hot pretzel and cotton candy and a soda it's really funny 

246.39 247.89 A: yeah 

254.40 256.01 A: [noise] oh yeah 

257.51 261.01 A: yeah they can really uh raise those prices [laughter] 

260.36 269.66 B: [mn] right and and of course you don't even enjoy it so much you pay it and then you're like why did i just pay five dollars for a small soda that doesn't make sense [sigh] 

267.12 268.32 A: i know [laughter] 

268.37 270.87 A: [sigh] yeah kind of outrageous 

269.73 275.50 B: and five fifty for half a subway sandwich when i normally get the whole thing for three dollars 

274.53 278.38 A: [laughter] yeah yeah that's true but people pay it 

277.77 280.66 B: yeah it's really funny a- i 

279.52 281.62 A: yeah 

282.23 283.21 B: (( don't know )) 

285.29 288.77 A: [noise] yeah so who was playing uh when you watched the dodgers [noise] 

288.38 292.18 B: uh the phillies and the dodgers got cremated 

290.01 290.96 A: oh 

291.81 293.61 A: oh lovely [laughter] 

292.83 303.79 B: he uh he had twice they had the bases loaded [lipsmack] no no outs twice the bases loaded no outs and then promptly struck out without getting a run in both innings 

297.08 300.03 A: oh yeah 

302.95 304.59 A: oh wow 

303.75 311.02 B: [mn] they th- uh i mean the final score was only four to one but it was weird because of those two moments where they actually had the bases loaded 

310.40 311.86 A: yeah 

310.94 322.32 B: and and and what was also strange is that the phillies brought in like every time the bases were loaded they brought in a different pitcher and i've never seen that before because when i was a real baseball fan i was a mets fan 

322.21 326.14 B: you know about ten years ago probably and uh 

324.48 325.37 A: mhm 

327.23 331.01 B: they huh they never replaced the pitchers and if they did it was in the ninth inning 

330.92 331.92 A: yeah 

331.20 337.97 B: and now the phillies brought in four pitchers and they were ahead by three runs and they still had four different pitchers 

337.70 339.12 A: wow [noise] 

338.08 344.89 B: and one and once uh they they had two different pitchers in one inning in one point there i mean they brought in two replacement pitchers so three pitchers in that inning 

344.85 346.45 A: yeah oh wow 

346.55 348.93 A: yeah you don't really see that 

348.64 350.22 B: do you you have children 

350.22 358.20 A: i do uh-huh and my son plays baseball oh you know i babysit that's why but my son plays baseball so that's probably why i really like it [laughter] 

351.05 352.59 B: i hear in the background 

352.86 354.93 B: h- oh okay 

356.78 360.73 B: right and what about him what does he like as a as a child 

359.25 360.26 A: (( uh )) 

360.32 369.17 A: you know he likes baseball and football he'll watch he likes football on t._v. even though i'm i don't know how he can get it when i don't get it [laughter] but it seems like they [laughter] 

361.91 362.85 B: mhm 

363.57 364.49 B: uh-huh 

366.72 368.62 B: (( right [mn] is it a )) 

368.98 370.21 B: they pick it up 

369.74 373.63 A: yeah they can learn i guess real quick but yeah 

372.55 377.76 B: is it a big part of his life watching it on t._v. or does he prefer it live 

377.73 387.05 A: you know he just watches on t._v. and likes to play so yeah [noise] yeah we're thinking about getting tickets you know to all go watch uh baseball 

380.56 381.52 B: uh-huh 

382.36 383.72 B: so he doesn't go to li- 

387.05 387.94 B: right 

387.27 390.90 A: so we're gonna look into that so that should be fun for them [noise] 

389.00 392.02 B: right i mean the dodgers' games are actually 

392.20 403.63 B: [noise] you know you we got these six dollar seats the other day you just go up the day of and get six dollar tickets and that's kind of fun [noise] and actually some of the six dollar seats are right right near the field i mean they're in the outfield but 

398.60 399.75 A: oh okay 

403.54 405.04 A: [lipsmack] oh really 

403.98 413.47 B: they're yeah they're they're what's it called the pavilions so they're they're in the outfield so you're like under the big screen so you're not like right you know 

405.05 406.30 A: oh 

407.26 408.23 A: uh-huh 

413.30 414.61 A: oh okay 

413.75 416.85 B: you have to turn your your head to see the screen but 

415.86 417.53 A: yeah 

416.94 424.70 B: but still you're right on the field right near um [lipsmack] what's his name sean green [noise] was playing and he's you know the big [noise] 

418.59 420.60 A: yeah oh that's a good deal 

422.12 422.83 A: (( oh )) 

424.89 425.93 B: i guess 

425.55 427.11 A: yeah oh 

426.01 438.95 B: big dodgers star so [noise] so that was kind of fun 'cause you know i mean it adds up by the time you you park and then you get the tickets and then you eat so but still i mean six dollars is less than a movie so 

427.70 428.46 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

436.19 437.27 A: yeah 

438.45 441.07 A: yeah that's true that's a good deal 

440.84 447.45 B: you know and if you're got a bunch of people in your car then the parking is is worth it right 

444.60 447.22 A: yeah just fill it up [laughter] fill up your car 

447.35 456.90 B: right and then parking's worth it but it was i mean it was a fun night it's not that expensive and and then sometimes they give the free things out on the games [laughter] that's fun and 

449.26 450.74 A: yeah 

455.14 456.66 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

456.88 458.88 A: yeah my huh
