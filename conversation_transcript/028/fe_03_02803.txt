0.05 1.49 B: this is kara 

1.71 3.23 A: hi karen 

3.10 4.04 B: (( kara )) 

3.93 6.52 A: kara hi my name is constan 

4.50 5.32 B: hi 

6.18 7.05 B: hi 

7.13 8.04 A: hi 

8.05 12.20 A: uh do you have a favorite sport that you like to watch on t._v. 

10.06 11.07 B: (( um i )) 

11.63 15.59 B: i really h- have nothing to do with sports what about you 

15.85 16.84 A: um 

16.50 17.24 B: [mn] 

17.74 22.43 A: right now i i guess i like to watch college basketball when they're doing the 

22.44 23.25 A: ah 

23.66 24.94 A: tournament 

25.21 30.67 A: other than that i probably don't specifically turn on the t._v. to watch a sport 

30.21 31.22 B: (( right )) 

30.92 34.78 A: but i will watch baseball sometimes if there's nothing else going on 

34.83 45.34 A: or um i'll watch professional football if my team you know our city team is playing i'm from saint louis so if the rams are playing i might watch them but 

42.72 43.58 B: mhm 

44.79 46.58 B: mhm 

45.63 49.97 A: again if i miss it i'm not disappointed [laughter] 

49.76 55.63 B: so do you feel like it's more based on the team or based on the sport whether or not you just watch it 

56.14 59.07 A: um oh let me see 

59.08 60.47 A: i would say 

61.62 63.13 A: i guess the team 

63.01 64.13 B: mhm 

63.86 65.56 A: because ah 

66.06 78.27 A: i yeah i'm more likely to tune in if it's a team that i either you know my college team or if it's a city team then i'm more likely to watch it than if it's just a particular sport 

78.24 79.02 B: (( yeah )) 

79.25 80.63 B: (( [lipsmack] hm )) 

80.46 86.85 A: do you watch anything like you know wimbledon tennis or golf or any of those type of sports 

84.98 86.07 B: um 

86.17 95.16 B: not really occasionally when ice skating is on i'll watch it but i don't really know anything about it i just enjoy watching it so [lipsmack] um 

95.16 98.75 A: do you watch it all all during the olympics do you get into the ice skating 

98.74 99.67 B: um 

99.87 103.58 B: no i mean i skimmed the the 

104.19 107.61 B: um programming during the olympics but i don't know 

107.68 111.92 B: [laughter] this is a weird topic for me 'cause i i just don't know much about it but 

114.00 122.74 A: [laughter] i watch some of the ah i think they're in the well one thing is that it's usually the only thing on 'cause everything else is in repeats because the olympics is on 

122.11 123.36 B: (( [lipsmack] um that's true )) 

122.84 126.35 A: and so you end up watch a little bit more than maybe you would 

125.86 127.21 B: yeah 

126.58 138.66 A: and plus the some of the other it's more i guess of a to get some history of the different countries and that type of stuff so yeah so i i intend to 

134.73 135.91 B: yeah that's true 

138.70 144.91 A: i guess tune in more for the broadcasting nature of it than necessarily the sporting aspect of it 

144.37 147.07 B: right they make kind of a big show about it 

146.71 147.71 A: right 

147.18 149.67 B: so it's more than just the sports 

149.80 152.47 A: do you have like a particular ah 

152.79 156.52 A: oh i mean you said you don't really watch much sports on t._v. but 

155.71 156.63 B: (( no )) 

156.71 163.19 A: i mean do you are you more likely if a certain person is you know the commentator than another person or 

162.79 171.55 B: um if i recognize a person's name then i'm more likely to watch it obviously because i know they must be a pretty famous if they are so 

171.35 172.84 A: [laughter] 

173.42 174.38 A: (( ah )) 

174.42 178.79 A: sometimes i don't i i'm unfamiliar with even the person 

178.44 179.58 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

178.96 180.67 A: you know commenting that 

182.08 185.06 A: i i think that like for the college team 

185.31 189.70 A: it tends to be the same group of two people that do the commentary 

190.19 194.56 A: and so you kind of ah i guess get used to hearing their 

195.02 196.29 A: their talk 

196.01 196.93 B: right 

196.69 205.86 A: and the same thing the baseball but there's sometimes like another station will pick it up and it will be somebody different and i'll go oh i liked the other person better 

205.03 211.48 B: oh so that's a a big part of you deciding to watch a sport or not like who the announcer person is 

211.17 226.12 A: it could enhance it definitely it could also detract from it i mean there's some people that i tune in and and i just i turn the volume down and just watch the i just kinda watch the the picture as opposed to the sound 

212.38 213.22 B: mhm 

224.05 225.16 B: (( right mm )) 

226.27 227.37 A: um 

227.52 229.59 A: what about like the 

229.93 236.75 A: like i think the kentucky derby was this past weekend do you watch anything like that you turn in specifically to watch that or 

233.59 234.78 B: (( no [laughter] )) 

235.98 237.79 B: i didn't no 

237.64 238.62 A: [laughter] 

238.94 242.56 A: um oh some people are kind of big on that that 

242.76 246.14 A: you know sit there all afternoon waiting for it to happen and then it it's over 

245.30 246.26 B: really 

246.71 247.62 B: is 

247.03 248.80 A: but that's not me i 

248.91 252.21 A: didn't didn't watch it either so um 

253.28 255.81 A: hockey are there are there 

255.97 261.15 A: sports that you would prefer to go to the game as opposed to watching it on t._v. or vice versa 

261.23 262.67 B: oh um 

262.81 265.16 B: let's see i'd say 

265.17 274.79 B: watching them in person and watching them on t._v. are kind of similar although i guess i mean just the fact that you're in real life is different 

274.79 285.67 B: but watching the sport is pretty much the same to me either way i mean playing the sport could be different not that i do but like the idea of playing a sport is completely different than watching it i think 

285.40 286.32 A: uh-huh 

286.62 293.55 A: well i think that a dif- again it kind of goes with if you know if it's your team you know you're from your city or 

292.26 293.09 B: right 

293.67 304.23 A: your college is playing it could be some ah rivalry going on and you'll have more cheering and the cheerleaders and you you have more atmosphere if you're at the game than if you're just at home 

298.10 299.07 B: right it's 

301.88 303.18 B: yeah 

303.90 308.00 B: yeah there's more invested in it than just you know the sport itself 

304.29 305.09 A: (( like )) 

307.76 312.02 A: yeah sometimes i prefer to watch it at home though than go to the game 

311.90 325.24 A: even though knowing i'm gonna miss that part of it because i could always get up and go to the bathroom or or fix dinner or just kind of keep an eye on and do other things read a book and [laughter] and kind of just have it on in the background so 

316.92 317.82 B: (( right )) 

321.33 322.22 B: yeah 

324.37 325.24 B: (( right )) 

325.19 328.30 A: sometimes i prefer just to just to stay home as opposed to 

328.34 329.39 A: to going 

328.89 331.07 B: yeah it depends what you want from it basically 

331.19 342.07 A: yeah like baseball can be really slow especially if it's you know a slow game or not much is going on if you're there i get bored really quick whereas if i'm at home i can just kind of leave and then come back 

336.55 337.51 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

342.76 343.63 A: um 

345.08 346.80 A: (( but ah i )) 

347.94 351.75 A: guess there's hockey games too but i have a 

350.44 352.47 B: they're so kind of violent aren't they 

352.45 356.38 A: yeah oh i have trouble keeping up with the the puck on the t._v. 

355.86 357.07 B: (( [laughter] )) 

356.51 357.83 A: because 

357.84 360.83 A: i i think the cameras just go too fast 

360.17 361.60 B: (( mhm mm )) 

361.28 363.90 A: so i don't really watch much of that 

364.16 366.14 A: on t._v. um 

366.21 369.12 A: i haven't really gone to a game for a really long time either 

369.24 377.06 A: i think the sometimes they they showcase the violence just to get people more people interested i think that draws some people in but 

374.58 375.86 B: oh my goodness 

377.29 380.20 A: (( they probably lost the picture with other people )) 

380.02 381.46 B: yeah 

381.88 383.01 A: um 

384.20 391.04 A: do you like to watch games with other people like would you have like parties around games that you think like the superbowl 

390.64 392.22 B: no i mean 

391.61 392.99 A: (( a little party )) 

392.57 400.00 B: i mean i suppose anything is enhanced with your friends but i wouldn't specifically do it for like around the sport or a game you know 

400.30 405.58 A: like we've had people over um when the rams were winning the superbowl 

405.07 405.96 B: uh-huh 

405.79 418.05 A: and when we watch the games we'd have people around on a sunday afternoon come watch the game and have some chips and stuff so we've done that kind of thing so that tends to detract from watching the game 'cause you end up just socializing more than 

411.22 412.21 B: mhm 

417.89 419.04 B: right 

418.43 420.55 A: really watching it i think but 

419.94 421.76 B: yeah 

421.59 422.68 A: um 

423.83 430.68 A: ah do you have you know husband or significant other that is really into games and watching them on t._v. and 

430.89 432.35 B: [mn] wait what was that 

432.43 438.01 A: i said do you have like a husband or a significant other that's really into watching those things on t._v. 

435.16 436.12 B: oh 

436.74 437.48 B: (( nope )) 

438.13 440.58 B: i'm in college so um 

440.64 444.73 B: [lipsmack] you know actually you know what my dad doesn't watch sports either so 

444.91 447.22 A: so it must just run in your family [laughter] 

446.54 452.38 B: right that's probably why i don't watch them because i wasn't i didn't grow up seeing it on t._v. or anything like that 

452.65 463.76 A: yeah my dad watches he watches golf a lot usually if there's a game on like if it's a football game or the baseball game he's usually watching it but it's not one of those that 

455.64 456.63 B: mhm 

464.03 469.75 A: everything has to be silenced and you know no more talk during the game and 

469.22 470.98 B: right yeah 

470.48 472.57 A: i know there's some people that are 

472.74 476.19 A: you know they're just so into it they're almost like yelling at the t._v. 

475.92 477.08 B: right [laughter] 

476.32 479.00 A: i'm not not really 'round that either so 

479.74 480.82 A: (( [mn] um hm )) 

482.30 484.74 B: and what sport is this that you oh golf 

484.92 488.27 A: he watches golf and then he'll also watch ah 

488.43 492.13 A: like the football or the baseball when it's on t._v. 

492.28 493.22 B: right 

492.72 495.33 A: and ah but 

495.62 498.97 A: very seldom does he watch the other games 

499.98 500.93 A: of other 

500.94 505.11 A: teams unless there's just nothing else on but he'll probably have sports on 

501.61 502.47 B: mhm 

504.82 505.98 B: mhm 

505.33 507.83 A: if there isn't a movie or something on 

507.53 508.60 B: yeah 

507.98 514.50 A: my husband is completely unsports i end up probably picking sports more often than he does 

513.98 514.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

514.79 515.55 A: [laughter] 

515.60 519.68 A: um and then he'll sit down and watch it with me too but 

520.08 523.19 A: he would prefer like the discovery channel or 

522.86 524.10 B: oh that's cool 

524.97 526.82 A: ah nature or something like that 

525.70 526.26 B: (( [mn] )) 

527.07 530.48 A: but i would probably prefer sports if i get a little bored with the others 

529.69 531.01 B: (( right )) 

531.40 533.67 A: so it's kind of ah interesting 

534.16 539.66 A: ah i think we should probably be wrapping this up [laughter] it seems like we've been talking for a while 

536.93 537.96 B: yeah 

539.27 541.27 B: have you ever called this before 

541.42 543.36 A: yeah one other time 

543.51 545.03 A: is this your first 

544.55 546.97 B: yeah no this is actually my third call 

545.33 546.07 A: (( call )) 

546.60 549.04 A: call okay so this is the end for you 

548.86 553.07 B: yeah um this will probably chime in at some point [laughter] 

549.96 550.73 A: (( so )) 

552.44 553.28 A: [laughter] 

553.59 560.50 A: yeah it's the second one they ah at the first one i know it just beeped and then they said wind up you have thirty seconds left and 

560.05 560.99 B: (( right )) 

560.70 567.82 A: yeah [mn] um let's see what else about sports i don't know anything [lipsmack] 

569.42 570.50 A: (( um )) 

571.49 573.14 A: do you think there's too much 

573.18 575.98 A: sports on t._v. too many channels 

575.79 576.37 B: (( um )) 

576.46 590.57 B: not really i think it's a matter of personal preference so if sports is there for those who want to watch it it although when games take up um programming time that's kind of annoying you know um when they run overtime or whatever 

590.24 591.20 A: uh-huh 

590.86 594.24 B: into other shows that are supposed to be showing that's kind of annoying 

594.07 599.89 A: yeah that happens a lot during football season so well next sunday night it will go into 

596.11 597.01 B: yeah 

598.97 599.95 B: yeah
