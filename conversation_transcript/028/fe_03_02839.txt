171.27 172.33 A: yeah

177.52 178.45 B: you know 

178.69 180.52 B: in person you get caught up 

179.76 182.82 A: (( mhm ))

196.48 201.74 B: but i turned the t._v. on because i wanted to see what the temperature was outside 'cause i had to drop something off 

200.23 203.04 A: mhm 

202.22 208.96 B: and they actually announced what the temperature was in kentucky and i said why would they be doing that 

206.30 207.27 A: yeah 

209.02 211.60 B: then it occurred to me oh 

211.27 213.17 A: [mn] [laughter] the derby was on 

211.90 213.77 B: it's spring 

213.24 214.26 A: yeah 

213.82 217.53 B: so i cau- i kind of wa- ended up watching it by accident 

217.44 218.42 A: uh-huh 

218.92 223.81 B: but it doesn't do it for me it's kinda like watching stock car races 

223.43 224.61 A: yeah 

224.26 228.04 B: you know they just go around and around and around 

227.90 229.05 A: yeah 

229.79 234.45 B: have you um ever done one of these things before 

234.02 236.53 A: no i haven't um my wife has 

236.86 240.49 A: and she happened not to be home tonight and i picked up the phone [laughter] 

240.59 243.99 B: well would well you just made her ten dollars 

244.20 245.14 B: right 

244.78 245.93 A: i think so 

245.57 250.23 B: i did it earlier today on actually the same topic topic 

250.48 256.30 B: with a with a woman and it just so funny that i mean they they have your profile 

251.69 252.62 A: uh-huh 

256.04 257.35 A: yeah 

257.06 258.19 B: yet [mn] 

258.72 260.50 B: they put two women together 

260.45 261.37 A: uh-huh 

260.69 263.84 B: to discuss televised sports which is so it's kinda weird 

263.48 264.69 A: yeah 

264.22 266.43 B: it's more of a guy's domain 

266.26 267.39 A: right 

266.78 268.76 B: you know by my way of thinking 

268.62 271.43 A: but i think there's a lotta women that like sport [noise] 

271.11 272.08 B: yeah 

272.64 274.71 B: but just in general 

274.27 275.15 A: (( uh-huh )) 

275.26 278.80 B: 'cause i believe that this is a linguistics 

279.18 281.50 B: (( i- i- this is a linguistic study )) 

281.10 282.32 A: yeah 

282.15 286.63 B: and i think what they're doing is drawing topics out there just to hear how people talk about 

286.19 287.36 A: right 

286.82 288.22 B: things in common 

288.78 292.79 B: and sports i think makes sense if it's a guy to another guy 

292.70 293.89 A: yeah 

293.64 294.62 B: (( but i )) 

295.28 298.07 B: don't know it just seems like kind of a weird topic 

298.37 301.24 B: for men and women and women and women 

300.95 302.07 A: yeah

317.28 318.34 B: yeah 

318.39 319.37 A: well
