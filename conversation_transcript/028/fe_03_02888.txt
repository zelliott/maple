249.40 250.98 B: wow 

250.28 258.34 A: he actually last night he went to bed around six or seven after having a bottle and did not wake up until six fifty this morning [noise] 

258.16 259.97 B: oh my go- you're kidding 

259.46 260.24 A: no 

260.29 261.38 A: i was [noise] 

260.79 263.50 B: [cough] my kids didn't do that until they 

263.59 265.66 B: i don't think they've ever done that 

264.80 266.46 A: [laughter] 

265.79 270.24 B: and mine are now twenty one and seventeen i don't think they've ever slept that long 

269.85 283.06 A: yeah i woke up and like wait a minute i yeah i checked to make sure the monitor's on [noise] and everything sure enough he's screaming his head off and it's six fifty in the morning i'm like wo [laughter] okay time to get that bottle [laughter] but yeah and he 

279.35 280.71 B: wow 

282.29 284.38 B: yeah i'm sure he was hungry 

283.88 287.98 A: oh yeah he drinks uh about a ounce a minute [laughter] so [noise] 

288.01 292.29 B: oh go has has he started i'm sure has he started turning over 

288.73 289.32 A: [noise] 

292.29 297.32 A: uh he did once he rolled over but he hasn't done it in bed or anything yet yeah 

299.25 300.12 B: (( mm )) 

301.42 302.43 B: (( [mn] well )) 

301.44 310.89 A: ((  )) 

309.39 320.10 B: [mn] well i guess i guess 'cause it's different i mean when my kids were little we we weren't told to put 'em on their backs we still you propped 'em up on their side 

319.68 320.62 A: right 

320.28 330.27 B: with things around 'em so when they started it's easier to turn from their stomach to their backs and when they started doing that that was just miserable 

326.61 328.02 A: (( [noise] right that's right )) 

330.83 333.94 B: but now that babies sleep on their backs 

334.62 336.52 B: you don't have that 

336.86 339.71 B: problem 'cause that always used to wake my kids up 

339.57 348.89 A: [noise] oh [noise] well they they say it's easier still for them to roll from their front into the onto their back because that's how he did it because they're already up on their [noise] elbows 

348.36 349.35 B: (( mhm )) 

349.16 356.35 A: and now he's learned i'll put him like on top of me and he'll roll off he thinks it's a game actually 

355.77 358.26 B: [laughter] 

358.05 366.69 A: he hasn't rolled over again by himself but once it's off me and onto the bed he just keeps doing it and i keep picking him up and he just has a good old time so i guess that's kind of a sport 

366.41 367.43 B: uh-huh 

367.27 368.60 A: [laughter] 

368.05 371.21 B: yeah i we- he's you know he's making his own 

370.87 371.84 A: yeah 

371.72 374.01 B: well and they're so cute at that age 

373.68 376.52 A: and he he gives the biggest smiles too 

376.85 379.52 A: so he's spoiled but [laughter] 

379.22 382.38 B: oh well that's par for the course 

382.09 383.16 A: yeah 

383.09 386.19 B: does he look like you or your husband 

384.94 392.12 A: um he whe- when he was first born everyone said he looked like my husband and now everyone's saying he's starting to [noise] look a little bit a little bit more like me 

392.14 392.94 A: so

407.39 410.32 A: i don't know [laughter] [noise] we'll have to see where that goes 

410.79 413.31 B: mhm well they change so much 

412.88 418.30 A: yeah [noise] i mean he's alre- you know already in the first three months he looks [noise] so much different

466.49 469.79 B: oh i would the worst the worst time 

471.04 475.38 B: is when they get their learner's permit and when they get their driver's licence 

474.10 475.48 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

475.42 476.92 B: that's the worst 

477.28 478.55 A: i could imagine 

478.17 480.75 B: because all of a sudden they think you know 

480.91 484.53 B: i can drive i can go wherever i want whenever i want 

485.37 486.76 A: nope [laughter]

554.73 557.04 A: oh yes [noise] very much so 

558.00 563.51 B: but um yeah well and the joy of being the grandparent is that you can take 'em and spoil them 

563.61 566.66 B: and then give 'em back and not have to worry about it 

563.64 565.07 A: (( and then [noise] give 'em back )) 

566.70 573.22 A: or what my uh my husband's parents love to do is hold him and cuddle him and just love him until he poops 

573.25 575.13 A: and then boop he's gone
