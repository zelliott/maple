231.57 232.80 A: (( oh yeah ))

243.19 244.42 A: [laughter] 

247.11 249.49 A: oh man 

251.59 265.27 B: i love american football and i also love well here they call it soccer in jamaica we call it football but here they call it soccer or and they you also have american football but we play football with our feet and you guys call it soccer

273.05 275.83 B: right it isn't it really isn't 

274.71 286.94 A: it's really not and then even ice hockey now in colorado because the we have the the denver nuggets ice hockey's um pretty competitive here but there are a lot of states in this country that they don't touch hockey 

278.39 279.29 B: uh-huh 

286.44 289.05 B: that's true that is so true 

287.24 290.63 A: not at all so they're fanatics here 

290.13 291.49 B: (( yeah )) 

290.64 293.29 A: they're total fanatics [laughter] in this state 

292.26 294.78 B: [laughter] 

293.87 299.91 A: so if if you don't know what happened with ice hockey over you know over the weekend of a game or something you're in trouble 

299.45 300.67 B: yes 

300.06 302.38 A: so i [laughter] but 

301.53 311.99 B: but i've watched i've seen that live though i went ice skating near to this rink um near to where i live and i watched um i watched some school boys play competitively 

312.11 313.11 A: yeah 

312.38 320.60 B: yeah and it was pretty interesting because like i say as long as the name is sport i am involved i will watch 

320.48 333.57 B: i will watch but i really really do enjoy watching sports on television i i think it is a very very convenient option to be able to watch sports on television and i am very happy that so many channels carry it you know 

333.19 334.29 A: yeah 

333.66 344.10 B: yeah it's just so convenient i mean even when my children want to watch sports all i have to do is send them [noise] to click on their television instead of taking them i mean it [laughter] it is cost effective 

344.75 346.38 A: (( well yeah )) 

344.78 347.59 B: yeah it is it really is cost effect- 

346.48 351.83 A: (( now how come you how did you get such an interest in sports do you have kids who are in sports but )) 

350.69 357.11 B: yes my kids are ages five seven and nine and growing up i've always been an athlete 

355.28 361.03 A: they're still too little for any of this [laughter] but they must be in everything they're in a lot of sports activities 

359.19 362.84 B: oh yes yes they are they are real- 

361.37 370.01 A: yeah you know i i found when my kids were that age and they did soccer and basketball and all those things it was always so much easier to get interested and involved 

369.65 373.62 B: oh yeah yeah right but growing up i've always been an athlete 

371.29 372.89 A: it's so much easier 

373.50 375.21 A: you have too huh 

373.64 381.71 B: i yes right i always played different sports competitively you know even on a national level 

375.68 377.92 A: ah

432.55 437.59 B: yeah but i do [laughter] yeah i'm i'm a freak right [laughter] 

437.71 450.47 B: now that's taking it a bit too far now right [laughter] but i do i'm into sports and i'm really really happy that i can watch it on television because of the convenience i can cook while i'm watching 

439.86 442.92 A: (( [sigh] oh man well )) 

450.00 451.49 A: that's true 

450.63 458.22 B: before i go off to bed i can watch it as i wake up i can watch it i can watch re runs i even buy the tapes where i can you know

464.87 470.28 A: (( that's what i need i need to be watching more e._s._p._n. so i can get some more energy here [laughter] so y- )) 

465.91 468.93 B: [laughter] 

469.24 471.25 B: yes i do three jobs 

470.76 472.56 A: oh you do 

471.28 475.09 B: three jobs and still find time to watch sports yes 

474.33 478.12 A: oh my word and take care of the kids take care of 

475.11 476.69 B: three jobs 

476.70 482.07 B: yeah can you imagine it's a challenge but it's a challenge that i enjoy 

478.50 479.45 A: (( your )) 

481.95 494.57 A: [sigh] you know i think when i was about your age i did the same thing when my kids were younger and i was working and you gotta do what you gotta do to survive so you just take the jobs you can fit in and try to juggle it all like crazy and 

485.00 486.15 B: (( ok- )) 

487.96 490.67 B: right that's it 

493.08 501.73 B: right absolutely i do engineering i do work in the entertainment industry and i sell real estate so they're all very convenient for me 

499.71 500.73 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

501.74 506.06 A: man oh yeah you can schedule your time around a lot of that 

502.18 503.77 B: and i have a fierce 

504.51 509.77 B: that's it that's it because the only full time job is engineering 

509.93 511.28 A: (( wow )) 

510.17 514.95 B: but real estate i do that part time and i'm only compelled to go to work like twice a week 

514.66 515.92 A: (( oh that's not )) 

514.96 522.43 B: you know meaning like to attend meetings twice a week and in entertainment industry i'm constantly on call but yet i can choose my projects 

522.05 523.37 A: yeah 

522.56 532.38 B: yeah so it's it's working out perfectly well and i have a fiercely competitive nature and i think that has been derived from sports so it's easy to apply that level of discipline 

527.88 529.30 A: [laughter] 

532.29 540.72 B: to my livelihood it's very very easy that's what i enjoy most about sports the discipline level you know it helps you to be disciplined 

533.45 535.03 A: wow 

538.42 539.73 A: (( yeah the dis- you )) 

540.07 543.44 A: know you're absolutely right it is a lot about discipline 

541.40 553.41 B: yes it helps you to allocate your time too because if you enjoy sports you'll not only enjoy one you'll enjoy several and i think that's the reason i can manage so many tasks at the same time including being a mother 

553.42 554.49 A: yeah 

553.88 560.87 B: and a wife and a friend and a daughter that's what sports does [laughter] that's 

555.96 557.15 A: (( oh )) 

557.28 563.32 A: [laughter] well it keeps you active keeps you healthy too probably 

561.74 566.94 B: yes yes because like i tell you i am so fit i am too fit 

566.89 577.63 A: [laughter] [laughter] i i don't know is there such a thing as being too fit only if you have some underlying disease that's gonna hit you out of the blue some day 

567.00 571.36 B: too fit [laughter] believe me many people 

575.70 579.47 B: yeah which i hope not [laughter] 

577.93 586.46 A: no you know just those weird cases of heart disease that somebody didn't know they had some genetic whatever and they stressed it too hard but those are so rare 

583.31 584.91 B: right 

585.64 588.32 B: yes that's so true that's 

587.42 599.89 A: well i have to say that when y- when the olympics when the um oly- the athletes are really training in this town even the kids you know 'cause a lot of that the professional ice skaters are kids they're you know they're like twelve to fourteen years old they're 

596.54 598.76 B: (( r- oh okay yes you're right ))
