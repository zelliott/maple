305.59 308.43 A: okay i'm actually counting you know like um 

308.94 315.90 A: flipping through what e._s._p._n. has had on and i'll sit there and watch something for five minutes and it might be the scores and highlights and stuff like that 

315.32 318.76 B: okay that's what you said you did the scores and highlights 

317.02 318.12 A: (( yeah yeah ))

320.80 322.76 A: watching games

327.26 328.49 A: yeah i 

330.28 332.00 A: so many of the sports 

332.81 337.62 A: are slow and it takes forever and the scoring is slow and 

338.92 341.73 A: you could sit there for three hours watching a game 

342.13 345.24 A: in five minutes the highlights you've seen all the good stuff so 

344.76 346.18 B: oh that's true

418.79 420.62 B: mhm 

420.64 425.99 A: and they beat dallas so that was exciting because i don't like the dallas cowboys [laughter] 

420.65 421.58 B: oh see 

424.83 426.79 B: [laughter] 

426.44 430.99 A: [laughter] we lived up there and it was just awful the minute the 

431.18 440.14 A: cowboys went to training camp it was like baseball was disappeared it didn't matter if the rangers were going for a playoff position or not too bad cowboys took precedence over everything 

439.94 441.21 B: oh really 

440.57 442.77 A: yeah so i didn't like that 

442.52 444.51 B: no i wouldn't like that either 

444.34 445.37 A: yeah 

445.58 446.40 B: (( hm )) 

445.84 446.67 A: um 

447.32 449.54 A: and as far as 

450.91 453.06 A: oh okay the comets 

453.20 457.92 A: the women's basketball team i've gone to one of their games and that was really fun 

454.63 455.57 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

457.77 459.06 B: oh it would be 

458.81 461.29 A: yes i really enjoy watching the women play 

461.47 465.57 A: they have it's a real game instead of a bunch of big 

465.75 468.93 A: [lipsmack] whiny babies making way too much money [laughter] 

468.24 469.40 B: right 

469.52 470.57 A: um 

470.85 476.38 A: just playing me ball it's actual team ball and it's i really enjoyed that that was fun 

475.36 476.63 B: oh really 

476.74 478.03 A: mhm 

477.28 478.92 B: that sounds exciting 

478.97 483.49 B: i'll have to try to catch one of those games on t._v. if they sh- do they show the comets on t._v. 

483.32 485.77 A: i think so um 

484.62 486.05 B: on e._s._p._n. 

486.49 487.78 A: yeah 

488.16 494.66 A: w._n._b._a. i'm sure that they're on because they kind of head into a season when there isn't a lot of sports on 

494.39 495.63 B: oh okay 

495.13 497.99 A: because i think they start like in another couple of weeks 

497.75 498.90 B: oh okay 

498.75 499.89 A: which means 

500.13 503.37 A: well they probably won't start until basketball season the geysers start 

503.55 504.70 B: oh okay 

504.28 506.47 A: and they're in the playoffs right now so 

506.37 507.29 B: uh-huh 

507.30 508.27 A: um 

510.61 511.73 A: so by then 

511.99 516.68 A: hockey and stuff will be over so it'll be just baseball and women's 

514.33 515.22 B: uh-huh 

517.12 520.91 A: and they have a very short season too i wanna say it's only like two months 

521.11 522.65 A: where the guy's 

522.70 525.00 A: uh goes for a really long time 

525.02 526.43 B: oh really 

525.83 527.26 A: yeah 

527.05 530.28 B: mm [lipsmack] i'll have to look for one of those games 

530.65 532.01 B: (( on t._v. )) 

531.58 533.80 A: yeah it's um 

535.85 540.45 B: now um the houston oilers they went away and now they're back 

539.99 541.98 A: yeah now they're the texans 

541.87 544.30 B: oh they're the texans they changed their name 

544.16 548.00 A: yeah because the oilers went to tennessee and kept that name 

547.77 548.87 B: oh okay 

548.97 551.23 B: oh that's right i think i had heard that 

550.65 554.00 A: yeah but then now they're called the tennessee titans they changed it 

553.79 554.96 B: (( oh okay )) 

555.01 557.91 A: but they yeah they couldn't use the name 

556.33 557.22 B: (( hm )) 

557.94 560.04 A: and they had some really cool names 

560.36 561.86 A: that they were voting on 

561.57 562.76 B: mhm 

562.07 565.56 A: but evidently back in the old days there was um 

566.92 573.15 A: like a semi professional team here or something that was called the texans and to me that's just the stupidest name you could have 

573.17 575.74 B: [lipsmack] yeah that is kind of a weird name 

575.45 582.23 A: you know it's just really it's boring especially when you've got [lipsmack] the astros and the comets and the um 

578.21 579.18 B: right 

583.38 589.39 A: [sigh] everything is space oriented and there were some names that they had that had a space sound to it 

588.90 590.62 B: (( mhm )) 

590.44 592.79 A: but no they had to go with the texans 

593.33 596.86 B: [lipsmack] yeah with um nasa being there 

596.53 599.89 A: yeah that's what i said all the other teams are um space related
