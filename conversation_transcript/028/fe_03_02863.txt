62.75 65.00 A: i'm watching sports on t._v.

72.35 73.68 B: how many 

74.00 80.70 B: uh 'cause i well i have a television and it only gets network stations and it doesn't even get them in very well

81.70 84.17 A: do you have cable night cable oh mm 

82.73 89.85 B: no i no i don't can you believe it [laughter] well that's what i was wondering is how many 

86.50 88.63 A: (( no well mm )) 

89.95 96.52 B: because it seems like for like the n._h._l. do they play that at all in the networks or is that only on cable

117.01 121.63 B: is it a._b._c. that has it now or f._o._x. and i guess a._b._c. is the other 

122.24 123.50 A: right now 

123.64 125.58 A: c._b._s. got it back 

125.21 126.43 B: oh really 

125.95 133.07 A: and f._o._x. and n._b._r._c. a._b._c. has monday night football but e._s._p._n. has sunday night football 

130.64 132.04 B: that's right okay 

133.24 134.07 A: and 

133.24 140.33 B: oh ok- [laughter] no it's just that it's incredible how they split up all these things i'm sure it's 

134.51 135.28 A: what 

140.47 145.24 B: can you imagine how much they have to pay now for the the broadcasting rights 

145.70 149.51 A: oh oh they get paid a lot by the t._v. networks 

149.19 150.29 B: yeah

168.29 177.29 A: [mn] well there's good points to both and bad points to both i mean the excitement of being in a place and just uh you know the 

171.36 172.57 B: right 

177.87 189.21 A: the crowd and just getting into it's so much fun but you but you got better view at home you know and and you don't have the driving to do and you don't have 

181.63 183.10 B: right sure 

184.36 185.65 B: exactly 

190.32 190.95 A: (( uh ))

226.34 240.88 B: and i went with a friend who bought her two kids and it was their first baseball game ever and it was so much fun it was it was just a great the only the only thing was i felt bad for the kids because for them a no hitter really isn't 

233.75 235.08 A: oh yeah 

240.85 245.14 B: that exciting they'd probably rather see home runs and [laughter] 

244.19 248.51 A: or even for me and i'm forty five i'd rather see home runs too 

247.30 261.52 B: [laughter] but it was just it was great it was really it was a gorgeous day and it was a great game it was really a lot of fun and yeah so i might have to start you know getting into the phillies now

312.52 314.11 B: (( well uh )) 

313.07 316.44 A: all my life i think we're supposed to be talking about t._v. though

320.12 324.73 A: ma- i don't know if this call was for me or for my wife we both do this 

324.17 325.62 B: oh really

329.52 332.26 B: (( yeah yeah i'm on that one [laughter] hm )) 

332.31 337.87 A: i mean most of my friends get mad at me 'cause i can sit and watch golf for three four hours 

337.66 338.74 B: right 

338.38 343.98 A: which i love to play also but and they love to play but they don't like to watch it that's boring in fact 

343.41 346.58 B: oh really see i was i mean i've never 

346.48 359.42 B: i'm not a i don't play golf so i don't really enjoy watching it but my friends who play really love watching it so i thought maybe that was a that was the key if you actually played the game then you could appreciate it more on television but 

352.64 353.37 A: (( oh )) 

359.06 361.90 A: huh i guess that might be a little true but 

362.85 366.52 A: most of my friends would rather be playing i remember when my dad was 

366.69 373.80 A: used to watch golf and i thought he was it was ridiculous to watch it let's go play but now i've gotten older i'm into watching it 

370.76 371.75 B: right 

373.03 374.65 B: [laughter] 

374.34 377.87 A: and my kids do the same thing to me you're nuts let's go play

406.92 408.31 B: oh right 

407.70 409.07 A: [laughter] 

408.42 413.55 B: well supposedly it's um soccer now has the highest number of 

413.66 416.97 B: boys and girls more so than baseball and softball which 

416.25 418.69 A: oh no doubt in our family 

418.21 420.50 B: (( [laughter] yeah you there you go )) 

419.25 424.14 A: four out of five are playing s- are playing soccer and the other one did play soccer until he 

424.31 427.14 A: plays baseball football and basketball now so 

426.37 427.62 B: geez 

428.01 429.46 B: that's great 

428.98 434.67 A: but the other one is it's pretty much well i guess they have the other sports but they really love soccer so 

429.60 431.04 B: (( that's a great sport )) 

434.44 440.89 B: yeah well you know it's so great for kids because it's they're constantly active they don't have to be waiting 

441.09 444.32 B: you know for a turn or something like 

443.53 451.38 A: oh for sure and and in the leagues we're in they make 'em play you know half the time and oh they're younger so 

451.05 452.13 B: right 

451.58 452.99 A: but uh 

452.82 458.33 B: it's funny i when i was when i was younger i used to referee for the real the little kids 

457.91 459.43 A: oh did ya 

458.64 471.31 B: yeah and i remember my favorite image is like to the under eights 'cause they're they're they move in a cluster right where the ball is [laughter] they sort of swarm all around it [laughter] 

462.46 463.76 A: [laughter] 

465.04 466.10 A: that's it 

466.24 468.58 A: it hasn't changed at all 

468.69 474.15 A: i just saw it i just saw it saturday with my seven year old [laughter] 

472.44 480.69 B: [laughter] it's so funny i mean there's no point in teaching them to play position yet 'cause they just all wanna be where the ball is 

480.02 487.77 A: oh they don't even allow goalie or anything in our league they just ki- just stay in the cluster and run up and down yeah 

482.72 484.51 B: [laughter] 

486.07 489.39 B: (( [laughter] it's funny )) 

489.59 490.63 B: [laughter]

492.07 493.03 A: (( ho )) 

492.79 493.83 B: (( hm )) 

493.12 494.39 A: (( they have soccer )) 

494.79 504.41 A: and we would play it when we were kids just when we didn't wanna do baseball football or basketball or whatever but but it it's really gotten big now and when i was younger it wasn't 

501.73 502.89 B: yeah 

503.82 508.36 B: yeah it it is strange the way it just took off so quickly 'cause i'm 

508.66 510.80 B: i'm twenty eight and 

509.94 512.27 A: oh you're young geez oh 

511.07 516.75 B: i'm young [laughter] but when i started playing my father was my coach and 

517.09 524.90 B: i was the think in our city one of the it was the first all girls team so prior to that you know we have like the 

524.91 527.64 B: neighborhood team or whatever um 

526.16 527.21 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

528.17 535.78 B: they didn't really i mean even then they didn't whatever i guess twenty years ago it was still it wasn't merely as big as it is now 

536.06 538.68 B: it really i don't know what caused all the 

538.82 541.28 B: all the excitement all of a sudden but 

540.90 545.78 A: yeah [noise] in lancaster county every school district has tons of soccer teams 

545.49 546.76 B: yeah 

545.84 550.98 A: and they all have tournaments and all that stuff there's millions of teams there 

550.43 551.60 B: yeah

552.10 553.15 B: (( they do )) 

553.39 557.05 A: yeah we're off track here but hey [laughter] 

556.38 563.05 B: ooh track's not too uh speaking of televised sports i guess we have well it's still another year until the olympics 

562.47 564.75 A: oh yeah that's great too 

563.98 565.80 B: that'll be exciting 

565.24 566.77 A: oh yeah 

566.13 568.78 B: and it's supposed to be it's in athens too 

568.99 570.87 A: that'll be wonderful 

570.22 575.14 B: yeah ho- do you prefer the summer do you have a preference between the summer and winter 

573.52 578.84 A: i prefer summer to be honest for the uh oh well i watch winter but 

575.92 577.20 B: (( yeah i didn't )) 

578.32 581.68 B: [laughter] now see there's where my sports feeling is 

581.90 589.06 B: that's where i am becoming more and more addicted is whenever the olympics are on 'cause i used to just i used to like watching the figure skating 

589.21 594.80 B: and then since the skiing was on i'm sort of watching it and then i really got into it 

589.33 590.20 A: oh yeah right 

594.93 595.67 B: (( um )) 

596.20 597.25 B: so other 

597.52 599.89 B: well some of the winter sports are kind of weird
