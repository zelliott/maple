278.84 280.50 B: yeah 

280.39 281.22 A: so 

280.50 294.40 B: [noise] yeah we used to see when i was a kid we used to well [noise] not a kid i would a had kids of my own already but uh [noise] the next town over from where i was doctor jay was from so um [noise] [lipsmack] we used to seem him uh at high school you know [noise] and uh 

293.25 296.81 A: actually i uh believe he's moved down there hasn't he 

296.28 308.53 B: [noise] [lipsmack] i'm not sure it's like there's so many athletes and celebrities here what happens is a lot of these guys that did uh [noise] get out of the big cities [noise] they were in california for years [noise] but the cost of living has gotten so expensive over there 

307.95 309.20 A: mhm 

308.49 316.98 B: [noise] you know a house that's ten million over there is like maybe five hundred [noise] thousand on the water down here so their money yeah their money goes a lot farther so um 

312.84 314.25 A: oh really 

315.80 317.19 A: oh okay 

317.13 327.37 B: you see a lot a lot of personalities down here uh i live in like i say tampa bay [noise] st petersburg area [noise] and a lot of guys have uh [noise] moved over here [noise] um 

328.13 329.18 B: [noise] [lipsmack] 

328.68 334.67 A: now for tampa bay on in your draft did you all did y'all get hugh douglas or no 

333.91 340.30 B: [noise] i'm not sure because i been working so much since since uh what happened was my wife and i started a new business [noise] 

340.10 349.84 B: about uh two months after i had the heart attack [noise] uh 'cause we're retired we're in our [noise] uh mid fifties already and we were tired always being one step ahead of the bill [noise] collectors 

349.30 350.59 A: (( mhm hm [noise] )) 

349.72 360.47 B: and when i was sick that just set us back even more with all the hospital bills and uh against my doctor's orders i've been working like seven days a week actually this is the earliest i been home in a long time [noise] 

360.33 370.35 B: so i haven't been able to really sit and read the [noise] sports pages or find out what's going on [noise] i know because the tampa bay uh making it [noise] to the super bowl this year [noise] they didn't get it in the first round [noise] 

368.74 371.74 A: no didn't they didn't they win the superbowl 

371.12 379.55 B: [noise] yep yeah they won the superbowl the odds were against them to even get that far because [noise] we had to cross with [noise] philadelphia last year you know [noise] 

373.13 374.12 A: (( all right )) 

378.50 380.12 A: right right a- 

380.00 391.90 B: but yeah yeah they won they won and uh when you're in a position like that yeah when you're in a position like that you don't uh get in any first round draft picks they picked up some uh defensive people 

382.64 384.60 A: when they beat oakland [noise] [noise] 

391.84 398.76 B: [noise] and they they don't need any quarter backs because they had uh two sitting on the bench already that hardly got any time you know 

398.23 399.88 A: oh okay okay 

398.97 403.98 B: [noise] [noise] [lipsmack] but i'm pretty sure right after the guys they got they got this kid sean king 

403.80 417.25 B: that he uh [noise] he bailed him out a couple a years ago and uh then they had him sit on the bench the last two years [noise] so [noise] he's got the attitude and he should you know play me and trade me [noise] [noise] you know he really didn't see that much time this year and uh [noise] [noise] 

413.15 414.70 A: right right mm 

417.01 422.79 B: i'm sure somebody'll uh once once the season starts somebody will pick him up when they [noise] they start having injuries [noise] you know 

422.53 426.49 A: yeah yeah wow it's uh 

426.81 435.21 A: this is uh quite a lot you know ten minutes seems to go real fast and real slow [laughter] when you're talking about sports [laughter]
