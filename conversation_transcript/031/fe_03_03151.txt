213.07 224.92 B: um our cat is kind of demanding like um the minute i get up in the morning i mean like my feet touch the ground and she wants to be fed immediately 

224.72 225.79 A: oh really 

225.57 235.72 B: immediately and so that does get annoying because you know maybe you're not quite with it yet you know and um so that that and then um 

226.94 227.74 A: (( oh )) 

235.80 239.15 B: if she feels that she's not um 

239.51 247.56 B: you know gotten her breakfast so to speak as quickly as possible um she'll nudge at the door i mean like we have a sliding door

260.14 260.99 B: so 

260.19 262.43 A: (( [laughter] well it's a smart cat [laughter] )) 

261.41 263.91 B: yeah evidently so 

263.95 265.12 B: um 

265.15 273.43 B: but you know um but actually my most favorite pet of all in my whole life was a dog and um the dog's name was pickles

274.00 274.87 A: pickle 

275.91 276.70 A: oh 

276.33 287.00 B: but um but if you if you like today if you could just go out and say okay i've got this money and i'm going to get a pet and what would you get 

287.33 292.15 B: i mean for sure i mean like if no no holds barred 

292.86 297.52 A: i honestly i i i guess like a dog just 'cause 

297.97 304.03 A: i can't think of any other pet to get 'cause fish it's just like i feel like 

300.31 301.28 B: mhm 

304.70 306.52 A: you're just kind of 

306.59 310.74 A: i feel like any time you see a fish tank the fish is they're just miserable in there 

310.34 311.87 B: (( [laughter] )) 

311.12 317.50 A: i can't imagine them to be happy 'cause they got like one little like you know area to like do i guess a dog and cats you can 

317.73 329.26 A: they got cats they got the whole house they can go round the house and if they're trained they're going to leave out the house come back you know a dog's the same thing you know you can walk them they at least they've gotten more than just a little tank [laughter] so 

322.81 323.84 B: right 

328.42 330.41 B: [laughter] 

329.48 332.75 A: it'll it'll probably be a a dog for sure 

332.87 337.10 A: i'm definitely a bigger fan of dogs than cats so i'll probably get a dog 

332.99 334.10 B: i mean does it 

336.63 341.18 B: but like would i mean horses would come into that category would they 

340.71 345.45 A: oh i i don't want to get no i've no time for a big the uh [laughter] 

344.11 346.22 B: [laughter] 

345.41 352.32 A: i don't got a barn it's it's this is not working out for me so [laughter] i mean 

347.21 348.36 B: [laughter] 

349.26 350.37 B: right 

351.22 352.08 B: but like 

352.20 363.92 A: if if i were to ever like the coolest animal in terms of that it'd be something that i definitely can't have like a cheetah or a leopard but yeah exactly so 

361.10 362.58 B: oh yeah 

363.91 376.71 A: anyhow i wanna to live my life too type of thing so [laughter] um [laughter] but like i'm a fan of animals but at the same time it's one of those things where i don't have the time i'd never feel i would ever have time to commit myself to them you know 

367.01 368.13 B: right 

376.53 377.72 B: right 

377.10 385.98 A: you know i'd take care of them and then not just take care of them but basically have them be happy as well whereas if they were just being miserable i'd feel like they would always be miserable and sad and suffer as well you know 

384.06 385.26 B: right 

385.70 387.59 B: which is very thoughtful 

386.07 387.01 A: (( they'd get )) 

387.78 390.96 A: uh yes well at the same time it's also it might be just be 

391.08 397.74 A: my on my part just being lazy or you know not being willing to do something that may also 

398.02 400.39 A: because it's a two way street i guess 

400.04 401.84 B: right right 

400.91 402.12 A: yeah so 

402.52 403.50 B: wow 

402.74 403.93 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

403.76 413.06 B: my husband um knew a person once um who had uh this makes me quiver but had a snake [laughter] a big snake i don't even rememb- oh 

411.69 413.18 A: oh really what kind 

413.21 420.64 B: i don't know i i don't i'm not really good at snake names [laughter] but i think it it was like real [sigh] 

418.39 424.03 A: 'cause my uh one of my friends in college used to have a snake and he used to feed him live rats 

423.65 425.21 B: disgusting 

424.96 431.81 A: yeah but it was crazy like he got so big and then one day he actually unfortunately died 'cause 

425.76 426.65 B: (( i mean like )) 

431.86 440.42 A: one of the rats had like a disease that they fed him and so the disease like kind of ate up the snake from inside and like he died 

438.48 439.56 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

440.63 442.89 A: yeah it was pretty sad [laughter] 

442.14 446.57 B: [laughter] yeah i mean it's just like that is not the pet of my dreams 

446.53 448.46 A: [laughter] 

447.50 453.09 B: but i know my husband said it was like a really big snake i thought oh no way jose 

452.89 454.26 A: (( [laughter] )) 

453.41 460.23 B: because you know like we used to have a garden and um it was at a special place in our community where 

460.16 463.71 B: um you know this lady had passed away 

463.57 472.88 B: and she was quite wealthy and she had this beautiful estate so she set up this foundation and the you could go and actually have a garden and it it's it's quite nice 

472.72 479.36 B: and so we had a garden and uh a couple of times when we went to tend the garden this little snake [sigh] 

479.69 485.98 B: i mean like it would kind of come out and i would see it and i would jump and it was just quite entertaining 

485.86 495.09 B: to all who were around but um you know but snakes [mn] would not be my choice but i know i know they're good i mean they have their purpose but 

491.36 492.27 A: (( [laughter] )) 

494.85 496.04 A: right 

495.46 496.27 B: so 

496.90 503.32 B: anyway um [sigh] but i think if i could have the the pet of my dreams [lipsmack] i'm 

504.62 508.17 B: trying to think i think i would like a dachshund

510.58 513.34 A: (( oh yeah yeah yeah )) 

511.86 526.39 B: 'cause you know they don't shed and and um they're kind they've just got they're cute and um they're kind of short and they don't you know they'd be great because you wouldn't have to clean up after 'em and but anyway [laughter]
