404.53 406.13 A: [laughter]

425.15 426.85 B: family like they're 

427.10 428.79 B: you know like they're kids 

427.22 430.11 A: that yeah that i never understood 

429.34 430.75 B: (( yeah me neither )) 

430.60 432.32 A: it's so weird 

431.64 437.51 B: i mean it's you know you of course you love 'em and you you know but it's like there has to be a line [laughter] 

436.85 443.68 A: yeah you see like those celebrities who buy you know like three thousand dollar bags like you said to carry their little dogs in 

441.73 443.23 B: yeah 

443.40 448.72 B: uh-huh oh the- their little collars are like diamond studded i'm like oh my gosh 

446.38 447.87 A: (( yeah i know it's )) 

448.32 451.93 A: (( crazy [laughter] [laughter] exactly )) 

448.90 453.79 B: [laughter] too much money [laughter] it's so funny yeah 

453.02 454.86 A: exactly man 

454.60 455.84 B: so um 

455.57 457.08 A: i don't get it 

456.34 458.66 B: i don't either but um 

458.70 464.71 B: that's kinda cool that they have stores like the pet's mart down here where i live you can actually take your dog in 

462.11 462.95 A: mhm 

464.44 466.15 A: oh yeah we have that 

465.39 466.75 B: that's pretty cool 

466.26 467.63 A: yeah that is cool 

466.76 471.44 B: yeah i mean i guess if you're a pet owner you don't have to leave your pet in the car you can take it in 

471.13 472.65 A: yeah that is nice 

471.96 474.33 B: so that's kinda neat but um 

474.99 487.11 A: since i was just talking with the [mn] with the woman that i work with and you know we now that it's been getting nicer out we've been taking walks around campus and for the most part she doesn't have the dog on a leash or nothing 'cause i've lived abroad 

478.13 478.94 B: uh-huh 

484.66 485.54 B: (( oh really )) 

486.95 498.13 A: and it seems like other places in the world i mean they don't even have leashes the dogs are just so much more well behaved that you walk down the street and they walk next to you and you know that's it and so 

495.43 496.58 B: oh really 

497.29 498.13 B: wow 

498.88 506.95 A: i think that's interesting how i don't know because we're such a leashed culture that yeah you have to have it know because you can't trust anything 

499.83 501.19 B: yeah 

502.85 504.40 B: that yeah 

504.48 505.90 B: have to have it 

506.56 513.19 B: yeah that's weird i know i was um complaining to my husband the other day there's um you're supposed to pick up if you have a dog around here 

512.95 513.98 A: mhm 

513.29 515.70 B: and if it goes to the bathroom you're supposed to pick up 

515.14 516.25 A: right 

515.71 529.03 B: um and i've seen this lady like four or five times who just let her dog go and she won't pick up or anything so i've complained 'cause now it's getting warmer and the kids are starting to go outside and play in the grass and i was just telling my husband i'm like 

525.07 526.37 A: (( yeah that's not )) 

528.87 537.41 B: i want to give her some slack i didn't want to have to tell anybody [laughter] but i don't want to have to walk into it you know walk into it one day when it's hot outside it is so gross 

531.16 531.99 A: (( good [laughter] )) 

533.98 535.33 A: exactly 

537.21 539.05 A: you should definitely say something 

538.42 543.06 B: yeah definitely 'cause i mean you should kinda it's com- almost c- 

543.13 549.54 B: common courtesy to pick up especially when you live in an apartment and it's a common area and so 

544.54 545.93 A: exactly 

547.43 549.29 A: yeah absolutely 

549.34 555.84 A: i know like in new york you know you have to pay like five hundred bucks if you get caught not picking up after the dog 

555.61 561.82 B: really that's yeah i mean it makes sense especially in a crowded place like new york i mean where is it going to poop 

556.18 557.91 A: mhm 

561.68 562.55 A: right 

561.99 563.73 B: (( on the sidewalk [laughter] you know )) 

563.44 566.60 A: exactly and everyone's stepping in it 

563.78 565.13 B: that's pretty gross 

565.67 568.63 B: and everyone yeah [mn] but um 

569.29 576.03 B: yeah i don't know i think we'll get some fish i think um a goldfish would be nice 'cause they're so easily to replace you know 

571.52 572.71 A: [laughter] 

575.51 581.71 A: exactly and if it dies which it probably would you know he wouldn't even know [laughter] yeah right [laughter] 

576.17 576.91 B: (( so )) 

578.69 587.16 B: you could almost replace it with them telling yeah [laughter] without them knowing [laughter] and it could be swimming on top of the tank and they wouldn't know the difference [laughter] 

585.41 587.65 A: (( exactly [laughter] )) 

587.34 588.42 B: so 

587.81 591.03 A: look at the trick my goldfish is doing he's floating there 

589.13 592.17 B: yeah we could like oh how cute 

591.80 592.94 A: [laughter] 

592.18 593.93 B: yeah so um 

594.25 595.76 B: it's funny ah um 

596.38 599.89 B: i remember watching something on t._v. and the girl's goldfish died and
