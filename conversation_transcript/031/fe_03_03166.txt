94.09 105.46 B: we were babysitting a pet for um a friend last week and we only had her like two days but she was terrified of everything and it was a big dog she was like a sherpie and lab mix 

105.31 106.24 A: uh-huh 

105.54 111.69 B: but she wouldn't go up our stairs and then when we finally got up there in our bedroom she wouldn't leave our bedroom and she was afraid of everything 

108.14 109.53 A: she i think she was 

109.76 111.76 A: yeah she was in a strange house

123.78 127.53 B: yeah plus her owner has three dogs so 

127.82 138.14 B: she left two other dogs and came to our house she was separated from her owner from her the other dogs and she was just afraid of everything 

134.89 135.81 A: yeah 

138.14 141.80 A: yeah i had a dog like that i could never have left him with anybody 

141.74 144.15 B: mhm

150.00 151.10 B: yeah 

153.04 154.20 B: ah 

154.98 155.78 A: but ah no 

155.23 158.25 B: do they do they mind being separated it doesn't bother 'em 

158.25 166.60 A: no no not really um jacob's pretty independent he's the bigger dog and the little dog would rather be with me or my husband 

166.89 169.18 A: (( ben you know what i mean he's okay )) 

169.34 172.66 A: being with jake but he'd rather go with us wherever we're going 

172.30 176.98 B: mhm wow 

173.67 174.39 A: (( so )) 

176.00 177.61 A: my one's pretty good that way 

177.67 179.50 B: four or five hours a day 

179.77 184.36 A: oh yes i i i'm with them the whole time i'm home before i gotta go to work so 

182.54 183.54 B: uh-huh 

184.67 185.83 A: at least that 

186.49 187.66 A: and then ah 

188.42 192.83 A: you know my husband's with them in the evening or my ah stepson 

193.57 196.42 A: so they they're around people pretty much 

196.53 197.60 A: all day long 

197.38 200.14 B: right a lot of commitment 

200.49 205.48 B: we have a nine year old who's been begging for a dog for a while now 

200.58 201.54 A: yeah 

205.29 206.22 A: uh-huh 

205.69 209.95 B: [laughter] but we just we're constantly going out of town and going places and we just 

210.17 212.40 B: you know don't want to take the commitment on 

210.46 211.88 A: yeah that's hard 

212.96 224.80 A: yeah 'cause i mean scheduling vacations we always gotta make sure there's somebody around to take care of jake i mean the little dog like i said we usually either take him with us on the plane or in the car or whatever 

224.46 225.87 B: mhm 

225.65 230.15 A: but the big dog we have to you know make sure somebody's got to be around to take care of him 

230.63 232.29 A: he's too big to travel 

231.97 233.56 B: yeah 

236.63 237.33 A: (( um )) 

237.40 241.03 B: i didn't hear what the other was it how much time you spend with it 

241.79 242.67 B: (( with him )) 

242.01 244.95 A: yeah it was how much time you spend with your dog and 

245.03 247.41 A: what kind of commitment or something you make to them 

247.46 250.26 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

248.47 249.20 A: ah 

250.11 251.71 A: [laughter] 

251.51 253.79 B: for most people it's full time [laughter] 

254.00 262.69 A: yeah yeah cats are a little bit more independent you can you can leave a cat home for a week as long as you leave food and food out food and water out for it 

262.36 263.95 B: yeah 

263.19 264.88 A: like you know they don't care 

265.08 274.26 B: i think that's part of the reason we wouldn't want a cat is they i think they don't really care one way or another if you're there [laughter] where dogs you know they're happy to see you and 

270.59 271.47 A: yeah 

273.65 278.77 A: oh yeah definitely um dogs don't do well without you know 

279.39 280.25 A: people 

280.16 281.10 B: right 

280.95 287.98 A: you know i kn- i know some people like get their dog and just like tie him up out in the back yard and ignore him or you know what i mean get him for 

288.22 289.91 A: (( i don't know i'm just not )) 

290.43 294.54 B: yeah that that bothers me we have a neighbor that does that 

291.32 292.39 A: (( [laughter] you )) 

293.02 302.85 A: know or they get 'em you know for hunting purposes only you know and they treat them just as you know like that only you know they're not a member of the family 

296.71 297.65 B: right 

303.26 312.61 B: we have a neighbor that has ah two or three dogs that are dog house dogs they just they're outside all all day in their dog house they never go in and 

308.23 309.12 A: mhm 

312.95 315.44 B: i think it's more like a security reason 

315.55 316.44 A: right 

315.56 317.80 B: which is i don't know i don't agree with that 

318.23 319.07 A: right 

318.79 321.44 B: you know dogs are part of your family and 

322.05 325.68 B: but i don't know some people do that 

324.48 327.49 A: yeah they do and i don't understand it either i mean 

327.60 331.85 A: i figured if they bought it they must have really wanted it but then they don't pay any attention to it 

331.63 332.59 B: right 

332.74 337.31 B: i mean you can't you can't have gotten it just for it to sit in your back yard all the time [laughter] 

337.09 337.99 A: right 

340.01 341.13 B: (( i don't know )) 

343.13 343.75 A: (( um )) 

345.82 351.15 A: it's a fairly big expense too as far as keeping keeping animals as far as the vets and 

351.98 356.62 A: you know one one dog i have to take to the groomer about every six weeks [laughter] 

355.83 357.68 B: mhm 

356.91 359.98 A: and get him all cleaned up that's forty dollars a pop 

360.40 364.82 A: and the vet bill runs easily around two hundred dollars a year besides food 

365.72 368.59 B: for the shot what does he get like yearly shots 

368.43 373.15 A: yeah they have to have yearly ah i can't remember get ah 

374.09 374.91 A: (( ah dip- )) 

374.92 382.27 A: is it diphtheria and ah something and they get the rabies shot every three years and then more medication and ah 

381.81 384.66 B: mhm 

384.55 389.86 A: (( what else do they gotta get i don't know i know i'm due [laughter] )) 

387.68 392.63 B: [laughter] do they send you a little notice like the dentist [laughter] 

391.87 393.84 A: yep they do yeah 

392.72 394.93 B: (( [laughter] )) 

395.27 399.37 B: my sister has terriers little yorkshire terriers 

398.74 400.11 A: yeah yeah oh 

399.47 407.62 B: theirs is really tiny but the one she has one that's very sickly so she's constantly taking it to the vet 

408.29 409.82 B: but she loves them i 

409.79 414.26 A: yeah little dogs are you definitely get very attached to 

415.08 416.68 A: (( i know marnie's that way )) 

416.66 421.04 B: think that they're more dependent almost 

421.23 428.90 A: oh yeah definitely they're that i mean they want to be you know like cats don't lie under your feet you can't move without them moving with you um 

428.25 437.30 B: mhm 

436.63 442.69 A: do you have a big yard for a dog or are you looking do you think you're going to go for a small dog if when you get one or a big dog mhm 

442.31 449.29 B: well my husband's kind of like he wants a big dog and my mother in law has a seventy pound ah 

449.51 451.82 B: lab retriever mix 

452.13 459.04 B: and ah he's just wonderful and but i'm kind of thinking a smaller dog would be just you know easier to handle and 

459.20 462.83 B: (( so we're more like thinking we'll mix a mid size [laughter] you know )) 

462.72 463.60 A: yeah 

462.93 466.09 B: like the lady and the tramp dog that's kind of what we're thinking 

465.87 468.58 A: oh like a cocker spaniel or something like that yeah 

467.09 473.02 B: yeah something not too big and we don't want you know 

473.64 478.83 B: and obviously we don't want to trash our house but we want to make sure we don't have something that destroys our home either [laughter] 

478.03 479.93 A: right right 

480.16 486.88 A: well puppies i don't care if it's small or big they tend to get into a lot more trouble chewing things and 

486.60 498.26 B: yeah i think i'd like to go to like the like the humane society or something but i'm just afraid of getting a dog that had you know that might have that might carry too much baggage 

488.38 489.54 A: i know like 

498.27 500.03 A: right right 

498.79 500.20 B: it's hard to say 

500.22 501.08 A: yeah 

501.80 504.02 B: but we have a pretty big yard we have 

504.62 507.56 B: we live kind of out the country so we have a pretty big yard 

507.51 508.40 A: right 

508.82 510.56 B: enough room anyway 

511.68 514.90 B: and the kids would probably walk it quite a bit [laughter] 

514.99 516.04 A: yeah 

516.28 520.99 A: yeah that's my stepson's job that's one of his only jobs [laughter] 

520.12 521.96 B: (( right yeah )) 

521.04 522.85 A: walk the dog every night 

522.53 525.71 B: [laughter] does he complain about it though 

525.53 529.74 A: (( oh yeah it's just like every- walk the dog walk the )) 

529.76 530.90 A: (( dog )) 

530.23 537.30 B: (( yeah because with my nine year old she swears up and down i'll do it i'll do it i'll do it and i know that you know after a month )) 

537.15 538.98 A: yeah it won't be such a treat 

538.61 539.80 B: right 

540.12 542.79 B: it won't be so much fun any more [laughter] 

540.90 541.82 A: [laughter] 

542.36 543.24 A: yeah 

545.96 548.05 B: yeah definitely a lot of commitment 

549.64 552.38 A: yeah especially if you do go out of town a lot mhm 

552.09 557.42 B: yeah we we haven't we've moved um only three years ago but we go back 

557.52 560.23 B: not a lot but every couple of months or so 

560.65 567.23 B: um but it's something that it it's usually fairly quick we'll decide okay well next week works out we're going to go 

568.46 572.01 B: and that's only reason i wasn't sure we wanted to get a pet 

571.50 572.37 A: right 

573.45 575.26 A: yeah that makes it hard 

575.00 588.00 B: yeah because you don't know i mean you want someone responsible to come over and i know that my sister had someone watching her dogs once and she came home the place is trashed and they hadn't been over like at all 

585.53 587.74 A: (( yeah i don't really )) 

588.02 592.65 A: like the kennel thing either i don't feel like they get enough attention there mhm 

589.72 591.04 B: yeah 

592.37 597.61 B: and i've heard a lot of bad experiences of people with their pets in kennels 

599.05 599.95 B: they come home
