309.95 311.16 A: mhm 

311.20 318.83 A: i like cats so much better than dogs because cats are independent and they do- just don't seem to be so needy 

314.69 315.62 B: (( to be home )) 

319.45 321.54 B: (( at a certain time to let the dog out )) 

321.17 322.55 A: (( you know you don't )) 

323.59 324.60 A: (( really )) 

325.64 328.84 A: (( have to yeah true no walking )) 

328.70 342.82 B: yeah that's kind of how i felt 'cause we're we're young and you know a lot of times we wanted to take vacations and stuff and you felt like ob- you know if you had someone doing it's a lot to ask someone like can you take in my dog or can you stop by and let him out every day 

334.33 335.57 A: yeah 

342.70 343.81 A: right 

343.25 348.92 B: so we did take a couple of dog vacations which was pretty it was fun having him with us i don't know 

349.16 351.44 A: did you find hotels where you could take him 

351.04 354.54 B: yeah we actually went to vermont once with him 

354.42 355.39 A: mhm 

354.78 360.00 B: and we found like it was a nice spot you know it wasn't like a dumpy little motel 

359.68 360.66 A: mhm 

360.02 363.38 B: it was a nice place but they ah they were pet friendly 

363.14 364.03 A: (( ah )) 

363.81 367.61 B: so we took him along and that was kind of fun [laughter] 

366.29 371.20 A: mhm well there must be a market market for places like that 

367.74 369.24 B: he was good in the car 

370.67 371.95 B: yeah yeah 

371.28 374.09 A: 'cause a lot of people want to bring their dogs on vacation 

373.71 374.98 B: mhm 

375.17 378.58 A: but is it expensive to put him a dog in a kennel 

378.51 381.85 B: we've never do we didn't do that we've never done that 

382.07 388.95 B: actually i don't think we were that against the idea but it was thanksgiving weekend and i think all the kennels around us were already booked 

387.77 389.61 A: (( oh of course yeah )) 

389.00 390.02 B: yeah 

389.93 391.40 A: that's probably the case 

391.84 394.60 A: yeah it seems like that would be the easiest thing to do 

394.40 395.76 B: yeah yeah 

395.15 399.45 A: for the weekend if you're just going away for a short period of time just to have someone come in 

399.25 400.49 B: yeah true 

399.96 403.72 A: but yeah if you want to take a long vacation you know a couple of weeks 

403.92 406.48 A: it's like you have someone come into your house 

406.05 407.37 B: yeah yeah 

407.11 410.00 A: but i guess you might want to have someone come in your house anyway 

409.72 410.64 B: yeah 

410.29 414.66 A: to just check on things and get the mail and stuff like that 

414.11 417.93 B: mhm how how long has your husband been into fish
