15.09 16.93 A: did you like having a cat 

16.39 21.33 B: i did i especially liked it when it was a kitten though i will say that they were so cute 

21.78 27.46 A: i got mine when she was six months old so she was almost not a kitten any more 

23.88 24.84 B: (( uh-huh )) 

27.11 28.23 B: i see 

28.35 29.63 A: (( um mm )) 

29.10 33.23 B: i i got mine as a gift to my daughter when she turned seven 

33.86 47.38 B: and uh we enjoyed her very much she was underfoot a lot they're very close cats they require a lot of attention i think but then they're not high maintenance or anything 

47.50 55.32 A: the thing that shocked me the most is i grew up really disliking cats a lot and i got it for as a gift for my wife 

52.00 52.97 B: uh-huh 

55.48 60.04 A: when we moved out of town and she felt lonely and i thought well 

58.01 59.11 B: uh-huh 

60.23 74.29 A: i'll get her a cat she'll like it it'll make her feel better but i wound up being just the the sickest cat owner cat lover [laughter] that i'd ever heard of and um up until i had kids the- my cat was my life [laughter] 

63.83 64.92 B: right 

67.66 69.55 B: [laughter]

82.37 86.59 B: now my grandchildren um their mom has a cat 

86.88 101.50 B: and um the cat doesn't pay them any attention at all won't play with them and kind of runs away from 'em isn't um it isn't much of a social animal i guess you might say i thought she was territorial when the first one came 

101.63 108.00 B: she had nothing to do with him 'cause we were kind of afraid of how cat would react to babies you hear a lot of wives tales 

106.21 107.11 A: sure 

107.37 108.31 A: yes 

108.12 116.09 B: and um that was not an issue that cat never came around and is a little more friendly towards the second child 

116.19 127.81 A: mine's the same way too she avoided my son when he was an infant but started to warm up to him you know in the last year or so but then when our second baby came around she was warm to that baby right away 

122.18 123.24 B: mhm 

127.24 128.70 B: now is that a girl 

128.42 129.37 A: yes 

128.88 133.44 B: okay now i'm just wondering if there's something more rough about the boys i don't know 

133.40 134.63 A: mm i don't know 

134.65 137.04 B: but i really i i i ha- 

134.80 144.71 A: well she's a she's a scaredy cat as well a scaredy cat well so she the same thing she doesn't like strangers it took her a while just to warm up to him 

137.40 138.50 B: she's what 

138.85 140.44 B: oh okay [laughter] 

142.38 143.51 B: uh-huh 

144.57 149.85 B: i had instances when i invited people to my house when i had this cat 

149.86 158.48 B: and some of them there were some people who were allergic of course and there were other people who've had terrible incidents and they are afraid of cats 

159.04 167.57 B: this one friend that was so terrified said that a cat had jumped on her head and i guess you know that was pretty alarming 

167.89 169.09 A: (( yeah mm yeah huh )) 

169.86 171.89 A: i've never heard of that 

169.97 178.13 B: but but i do i kind of warm i really if i i think a a cat's a a nice pet if well because they stay inside and they're clean 

177.76 178.92 A: yeah 

178.46 181.97 B: but um i want my boys to have a dog 

182.01 185.78 B: my grandsons are one year old and four and a half 

186.16 190.81 B: and their mom says well you you have it and keep it over there [laughter] so 

188.96 192.54 A: mm yeah a dog is a lot of responsibility [laughter] 

191.26 196.73 B: yeah i know even with the cat we used to board it 'cause i used to travel a lot with my job 

196.86 200.34 B: and i'd have to board the cat whenever i left town so 

199.70 200.55 A: (( oh right uh )) 

201.44 202.85 A: the only the only 

201.48 205.52 B: does your does your wife stay home and and and keep the pet 

204.76 206.55 A: no we both work 

205.96 206.93 B: yeah 

206.56 211.05 A: so uh but as a cat you know she can take care of herself she just needs uh 

210.64 213.92 B: yeah like i mena if you're going away for more than a couple of days 

213.32 219.65 A: any time we've gone away um we've had people visit our home and uh feed the cat 

219.04 222.63 B: okay well that's better than boarding that gets expensive 

222.66 225.82 A: so so you're not interested in owning a pet now mm right 

225.97 227.87 B: [sigh] well i am 

228.26 229.92 B: retired now 

230.27 242.78 B: and that was the first thing some folks said well i'm i'm divorced too when i did that recently i guess it's been now five years my son in law thought you've got to get yourself a dog and for safety i guess too 

242.94 244.40 B: (( but um )) 

244.74 256.24 B: i'm not sure that i want to put that much into something right now i kind of like being a little free to come and go and do and i'm kind of an on on call babysitter for my grandchildren 

255.77 256.57 A: sure 

256.31 260.04 B: i live like five minutes away from them in fact one is here tonight 

259.43 260.88 A: (( oh that's wonderful [sigh] yeah yeah )) 

260.41 264.48 B: because the other one has a fever and a cold and we're trying to keep them separated 

264.00 265.08 A: yeah 

264.50 274.63 B: and um i don't know whether i want to invest the the time and i think if you got a pet you really ought to invest time quality time and attention 

274.82 276.30 B: i have uh 

276.32 279.97 B: a friend who has well they all really have dogs but 

280.12 283.93 B: the dog is they don't have children is like a child to them 

283.58 292.66 A: exactly the way my cat was before i had kids i i got very scared and as much as i loved my cat i had friends who were starting to have children who uh 

286.12 287.11 B: mhm 

292.66 307.19 A: would ignore their their cat and said oh well i used to love her but now i have kids i was scared that would happen to me and it hasn't in fact i feel guilty i feel guilty because i'm not able to give her the time that i used to [laughter] i mean i used to have real quality time with her every day and 

296.60 297.97 B: [laughter] 

298.11 301.28 B: yeah well good good

315.31 317.66 A: (( um yeah yeah yes exactly )) 

316.89 321.14 B: i understand how that is now i feel like my daughter too 

321.13 332.72 B: she used to sit there and just be rubbing the cat and it was right [noise] there beside her when she was watching television and i guess she just doesn't have time and when you've got two small kids and you work 

333.04 335.18 B: it it's not much time there 

335.75 341.45 A: i i miss having dogs and i grew up with a dog and i'd love to have one again but again just don't 

338.35 339.35 B: uh-huh

342.53 344.50 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

344.12 345.33 A: i hear the baby [laughter] 

345.23 354.88 B: well he's kind of getting on my lap at this point but he's he's almost asleep i just did that gotten him out of the bath tub [noise] and he's one of those that has to have a 

354.94 357.77 B: a blanket or something you know 

356.23 357.40 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

357.95 362.84 B: and he likes to he's like a little pet to me [laughter] 

360.63 362.13 A: (( [laughter] oh my [laughter] [sigh] yeah yeah yeah )) 

363.11 364.92 B: but very sweet 

365.34 366.53 B: um 

366.54 368.66 B: i guess when i had that cat 

368.70 372.26 B: that was probably twenty years ago 

372.48 383.41 B: so i haven't really i didn't grow up with a pet and i thought it would be nice for my daughter to have one but i can assure you that i wanted the kitten part of it more so 

383.54 385.65 B: but uh we enjoyed it 

385.95 394.10 B: and then the cat kind of got away from us you know we didn't let her go outside and then one day she would always be scratching at the door 

388.89 389.65 A: oh 

394.80 398.03 B: and we got this baby of course when it was just a new kitten 

398.04 401.50 B: and well not that new but you know i guess 

402.31 405.06 B: within months and um 

406.09 411.52 B: she wanted to go out so bad outdoors so bad she would just be standing at the door so she shot out the door 

411.57 414.20 B: and ran ran somewhere 

414.57 418.64 B: and uh i would call her and she would come back 

419.35 426.54 B: usually and this particular time she didn't do that and i don't know if somebody got her or what happened but of course that was devastating 

425.94 427.98 A: boy that frightens me yeah 

427.47 428.56 B: yeah 

427.97 435.17 A: i know when when we uh we were living in cleveland when i got my cat and we were lucky the apartment we were in 

435.09 449.72 A: had both the front and back doors we had two doors between the inside and outside but even if she got out of the apartment she was down a stairwell so there was a second door so we and then i i now lived just outside of atlantic city in new jersey and um 

439.81 440.94 B: mhm 

441.89 443.54 B: oh she couldn't get right 

443.76 444.81 B: right 

448.13 449.25 B: uh-huh 

449.68 453.47 A: our first apart- our apartment here as well was the same thing had 

453.61 466.22 A: two doors to the outside we never had to worry but now that we are in our house the cat has gotten out a few times even with the best of our attempts and it's scared us to death and luckily we've uh caught her [laughter] yeah 

455.52 456.52 B: uh-huh 

460.13 461.25 B: mhm 

463.90 473.35 B: mm i can imagine yeah well for for days we look we put up signs and you know you go through that and you you kind of get through it 

473.41 476.28 B: and so therefore we never had another pet 

476.10 477.05 A: (( uh-huh no )) 

477.02 479.77 B: uh what did you name your cat 

479.15 480.20 A: shayna 

479.90 481.52 B: shayna okay 

481.53 484.10 B: and our cat was called cassius 

483.77 485.84 A: oh wow [laughter] yeah 

484.42 486.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

486.22 497.31 B: yeah but but you know i really do i i think it's wonderful to have pets but i think it's a responsibility and you've got to have the time for them and you know um 

495.01 496.03 A: (( certainly yeah )) 

497.58 501.27 B: like you said you you're probably involved as you can be 

501.10 502.33 A: (( yeah um )) 

501.31 507.61 B: and i don't know i think for me i'll probably just forgo that pleasure for a while 

507.64 512.84 A: my my parents were were unable to get another pet after our dog died the one i grew up with 

512.31 513.30 B: uh-huh

518.99 520.37 B: mhm

527.12 540.33 A: when i was in college she developed an illness and was going was d- dying painfully and we didn't want to see her suffer so we were going to have to put her to sleep and uh my parents did not have the heart to do it they couldn't take her to the vet

557.81 566.51 A: um so at the appointed time they showed up to my parents' house and they couldn't find the dog anywhere and they looked down and at the bottom of the basement steps the dog was dead 

561.13 562.10 B: mhm 

562.97 563.63 B: (( [sigh] )) 

565.98 568.20 B: oh how about that 

566.53 573.29 A: and that was her her last loving gesture to the family was that she didn't make anyone suffer and having to feel guilty 

569.34 571.24 B: yeah
