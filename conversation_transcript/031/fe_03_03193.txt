28.92 34.18 A: as you would guess most uh landlords don't appreciate pets in their apartment uh appreciate pets 

33.95 45.81 A: i do have a pet at home which is in uh southern california um little uh uh a little miniature pinscher uh uh dog used to be um um i was about to say puppy he's about the right size [laughter] um 

45.75 50.77 A: cute little thing yeah my dad we got it 'cause my uh dad had a miniature pinscher when he was a kid 

50.82 52.92 A: mm uh and uh

65.42 73.19 B: i have had a considerable share in spoiling them they're brats i have two golden cocker spaniels uh and they're in india 

73.48 74.39 A: okay 

74.11 75.37 B: yeah two dogs 

75.21 76.52 A: (( cool [laughter] [noise] )) 

75.96 78.24 B: yeah uh so 

78.99 92.13 B: wh- what are your pets to you because i'm a total dog lover and um i i would e- every time i go back home which is in india i have at least one suitcase full of pet stuff and then you know 

92.03 96.16 B: gifts for my parents find a small compartment in my other suitcase 

96.02 109.51 B: so yes tho- those are my pets and they they they're total y- i i i'm ashamed of them because even being dogs [noise] they're scared of kittens and rabbits and i've i've never seen them chase birds or anything 

109.46 119.10 B: and uh they're they're scared little things and uh they're they're they're obviously spoiled rotten which means they have their preferences of meat and they they would leave 

118.92 124.75 B: like one of them hates peas so when you give him dried dog food he leaves out the dried peas in that 

124.50 125.45 A: (( [mn] ah )) 

125.67 129.72 A: let's see yeah my my dog is certainly uh strange in its own way too 

129.79 130.69 A: (( um )) 

130.64 139.64 A: first off you know mi- little dogs tend to yeah this is a toy dog obviously you if you're a dog lover you probably know that um and you know those tend to you know bark a lot right 

133.95 135.08 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

135.73 136.83 B: mhm 

139.18 140.21 B: (( right [laughter] [laughter] )) 

139.52 145.69 A: but for some reason our dog does not bark it's it's a sort of bizarre i- i- thing 

145.69 154.47 A: normally you know someone comes to the door the first thing he does is just run up there scratch at the door do- doesn't say anything the only time we ever hear it bark is like when it sees another dog and then it's not like a normal 

150.31 151.17 B: mhm 

154.45 164.45 A: you know like you know just shouting yeah like a a normal like periodic bark thing it's sort of like this weird constant noise that it makes [mn] it's strange um 

160.96 162.79 B: [laughter] 

164.38 172.45 A: but yeah they the the i don't know how much you know about miniature pinschers but they that particular breed tends to sort of have no inbred fear [laughter] 

171.82 186.17 B: right they they're snappier and they they they don't really a- adjust well with other dogs but i i've i've noticed that the smaller a dog is contrary to what we might believe they're snappier and the bigger dogs like i have a golden lab too 

185.94 186.79 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

186.08 188.18 B: he's he's very scared 

188.00 189.18 A: [laughter] 

188.36 196.57 B: i i i mean that is he's he's a shame to his size you know i i just tell him and my dogs are scared of kittens 

196.35 205.40 B: they my neighbors have kittens and they come over and they eat all the dog food up and they they scare the hell out of my dogs and my dogs would not dare go near them 

205.42 217.21 B: so it's i i i've i constantly wish that i would see you know my one of my dogs scare sh- you know shoo away or chase a squirrel or a kitten or anything 

217.20 227.14 B: but that's not happened uh generally it's me you know i hear yelping and i go out and i have to rescue my dog from some odd creature that's one tenth my dog's size 

226.89 229.68 A: [laughter] is it hard to take your dog for a walk or anything like that or 

229.40 235.34 B: yeah i do i do whenever i'm home i i do they they love to go out for their walks so 

230.86 231.70 A: okay 

235.47 239.15 B: it isn't quite a pleasant experience for me because um 

239.39 252.88 B: it they they just are not trained they run in all directions and it's very very difficult to catch hold of them but yeah when i take them to a you know for a stroll in the park and i take frisbees along that's one of the good times [laughter] mhm 

252.83 253.75 A: okay 

253.71 265.07 A: yeah my my dog's pretty similar we never really taught it particularly how to heel or anything like that but then again given that it sort of has a small mass it's not particularly difficult to keep them you know in in you know in a close range 

264.93 273.88 A: you know they just just tug along he may fall a little bit but when you need to continue you just pull on pull on a little bit and they they they it just goes in the direction [laughter] 

270.59 271.41 B: uh-huh 

273.41 275.66 B: oh my dog counts up to five 

275.33 276.29 A: huh 

275.77 277.93 B: my dog can count up to five 

277.56 279.01 A: wow it's 

278.18 287.29 B: yeah you hold up or lift up a finger and he barks one and then five he barks five times and then you six is like non stop barking for ten minutes 

286.67 287.39 A: [laughter] 

287.43 289.00 B: that we don't try 

289.03 290.18 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [noise] )) 

289.18 298.98 B: we we've tried it a couple of times but five is as far as he would go and you know four barks absolutely four fingers four barks three fingers three barks 

298.94 304.47 B: wh- a thumb up just one bark but six is like a riot 

304.80 311.12 B: that doesn't stop that just doesn't stop you have to shove some food into his mouth and say okay shut up 

311.38 312.43 A: great stuff 

311.51 318.19 B: that kind of stuff so any any any peculiar habits that or or talents hidden talents of your dog 

318.08 329.28 A: oh yeah um well we taught it one trick and unfortunately it learned it far far far too well um basically we learned we taught it the standard you know sequence you know sit lie down roll over 

328.94 329.96 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] [noise] )) 

329.62 335.92 A: but the thing is is that that's the only trick it knows and it knows that whenever it gets food nearby it has to do a trick 

335.78 348.11 A: so it has this kind of thing where it just lies down and starts rolling repeatedly in small circles it like stands up it like scoots around it keeps sort of in the same area then rolls over again and it's just hilarious [laughter] it it's uh 

339.74 341.32 B: [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] 

346.90 347.78 B: (( i bet )) 

347.82 349.20 B: yeah 

347.96 362.26 A: uh basically in order to to make sure we don't like keep uh it do- it doesn't get too chubby we make it do it it like six or seven times before you know we give it something yeah my dog is really pretty rather well at least was and probably still is rather spoiled uh it just you know 

353.55 355.30 B: [laughter] 

360.38 361.24 B: uh-huh 

362.16 366.36 A: i- it it's pretty good at begging at the at the table and stuff like that so [noise] 

365.31 374.79 B: oh yeah yeah my dogs too i- it's it's just amazing how uh being adept they are at all all that they do uh provided there's food around 

374.50 375.64 A: yeah 

374.97 383.13 B: otherwise i i mean that my dogs the the biggest talent or the part which i find the most human is ignoring us 

383.46 387.25 B: it's it's just when there are guests in the house and you want to show off your dogs 

383.65 384.52 A: (( yeah [mn] [laughter] )) 

387.29 392.95 B: you actually find yourself calling out to your dog and your dog looking at you like have i seen you before look 

393.08 402.22 B: you know do you exist have i got anything to do with you or y- you know who are you or or tha- that kind of look they look at you and then they go away 

401.91 403.25 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

402.39 406.98 B: it's all of a sudden that they become cats and they'd all develop attitude 

406.67 407.66 A: right 

406.83 417.47 B: and then when you're alone at home they'll they crave for all of your attention they want to come and sit on your feet and you know they want to beg and they want to do everything and they get this tennis ball in the mouth and they want you to play with it 

417.45 430.71 B: but um it's it's just when you want to show off your dog and show you know what a cool creature you know you own or you're friends with that they totally get develop this attitude and they refuse to recognize you mhm [laughter] 

430.96 441.19 A: yeah well my dog generally is you know i- is one for a lot of attention but the thing i've noticed is the fact that well you know being at college you know not a- as now i'm not normally home a lot of the time and i notice that there's this 

441.00 446.11 A: it really even though the the dog sort of knows me and it's not like it's a big surprise when i'm around 

443.40 444.41 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

445.94 457.80 A: it completely utterly ignores me in pretty much any context it's sort of like you know my th- my dad just says one thing and it comes running and it's like i i yell for it for three minutes and nothing you know it it doesn't even like try to stay there [laughter] 

457.42 467.35 B: the thing with my dogs is every time i go because i i was the one who was taking care of the dog when it grew up you know when they were puppies and they had to be fed every two and a half hours so 

467.11 477.89 B: it was my responsibility so the thing is that my dogs never snarl with me you know and no matter what i can pull a bone away from his mouth and that that would be fine but the 

478.35 482.62 B: person that they just don't recognize authority of is my mom 

482.45 483.43 A: (( hm )) 

482.73 493.35 B: they my mom keeps calling out to them and they just ignore her which makes her furious because considering she's the one person who sees them for the maximum amount of time she stays at home 

493.42 504.24 B: and they they just do that but the moment the kids leave w- we all uh i have my siblings and we are all in different colleges different parts of the country and in different countries 

502.54 503.39 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

504.13 513.77 B: so the moment we all leave after a vacation it's like a turnaround time the dogs won't leave her side and you know they'll obey her so 

513.68 527.83 B: i i i really think they possess the intelligence it's just that they don't use it also uh one of the questions that i ask almost everybody who has a dog is that i've noticed that you're either a dog person or a cat person 

527.46 528.75 A: (( mhm )) 

528.12 530.85 B: yeah do you find that to be true 

529.74 539.97 A: uh i think i'd probably be more towards a dog person just because well let's put it this way we've had a dog and a cat and well just in terms of my person appr- my personal uh 

533.04 533.87 B: uh-huh 

535.97 536.79 B: uh-huh 

539.95 545.87 A: uh experience the cat was really really really annoying totally it was 

546.04 550.38 A: my my mom was not particularly good at choosing animals uh 

550.29 564.46 A: basically she thought that the uh the one at the back would that wasn't like even trying for attention was cute [laughter] so unfortunately we got sort of a uh a uh noncommittal cat that sort of wandered in and out of our yard occasionally you know occasionally came back for food and 

555.29 556.85 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] uh-huh )) 

562.54 563.35 B: (( mhm [noise] ah )) 

564.71 571.50 A: in addition i had the small problem that i was allergic to animals until around like uh i was like sixteen or so which 

571.69 574.60 A: was annoying but at the same time you know it got over that 

574.40 584.10 B: pretty much what my mom explained we we used to have the neighbor's cat and my mom would actually invite the cat over like you know tuna feed her tuna so 

582.87 583.90 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

583.91 591.02 B: i- it was just that and i i just asked my mom i was like why are you a cat person more of a cat person she says look 

590.91 599.89 B: i come home and i wa- i don't want somebody to get excited seeing me come home four times in a day and you know like it's the end of the world you come home and the
