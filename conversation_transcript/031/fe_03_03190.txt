287.74 292.27 A: ha- do you know um d- have you ever seen on t._v. the pet psychic 

293.42 299.26 B: um no but uh i think it was a couple of weeks ago my mom was telling me about it [noise] 

299.39 303.26 A: there's a woman yeah who she's a pet psychic 

303.40 315.92 A: and she she comes and she looks at the animal and she'll tell you what's going on and what they're you know pass on information things that they're happy or unhappy about with you 

316.03 319.91 A: and it's and it's really amazing it's amazing 

320.37 322.12 B: [noise] that would be kind of cool 

321.82 331.95 A: it would be i you know you you you say to yourself well is this for real or not interestingly enough you know i i used to work at c._b._s. news i used to be on a camera crew 

331.88 332.79 B: (( [noise] )) 

332.19 343.30 A: uh for c._b._s. network news and when i in in the shop where i worked one of my colleagues another cameraman did a story on the p- on this pet psychic i don't know if it was the same one 

343.60 355.03 A: and he was a real skeptic he went and said ah this is garbage so they went to they they got the pet the pet psychic and they went to a woman's house who had i think either a 

355.00 360.00 A: a cat and a dog or something to do with a cat yeah i think a cat and a dog 

359.80 373.30 A: and the the the pet psychic said that told the woman that the dog wanted his bed moved someplace else and the cat said they wanted the litter box to be put in an another room 

374.35 381.07 A: which um [laughter] they actually did and uh and found out that 

380.94 392.91 A: things got [laughter] got better now my friend who shot the story when he went to do this he said this has got to be hokey but by the time the story was over he came back he said i think there's something to this 

393.08 394.26 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

393.31 400.10 A: and he couldn't he you know he was just amazed at at some of the things that that uh 

397.99 399.37 B: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

400.23 407.76 A: that this pet psychic was able to say to the to uh the owner of the pet about the pet that that was not told to her 

405.22 406.91 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

407.51 408.57 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

408.51 417.31 A: and he came away a believer so you know just based on on his his experience alone i i've always been curious about it 

417.84 422.37 A: you know but some of the some of those t._v. shows are really interesting 

418.88 420.24 B: (( sounds interesting )) 

422.80 423.61 B: oh 

424.10 426.85 B: i wonder how you would get someone like that to 

427.93 429.82 B: to come like 

429.99 431.88 B: to read my dogs and i 

431.02 441.52 A: well here's the other thing that was interesting on on the in the story that we did this per- this pet psychic was able to do it over the phone like you would call her up 

441.58 446.02 A: and she would tell you about your pet over the phone she didn't have to be there 

441.83 442.74 B: (( wow [noise] )) 

446.85 455.58 A: although on the t._v. show the woman who you know the pet psychic comes and and you know she'll stroke the the pet and talk to the pet 

455.53 462.34 A: and you know the pet may bark or or whinny or moo or whatever it does you know and then she'll turn around and tell you what they're saying 

457.04 457.78 B: (( [noise] )) 

463.43 470.81 A: and there w- [laughter] was one great show where she talked to this guy who had a couple of horses and and uh 

471.80 480.39 A: and uh the horse you know was unhappy with the pasture that he was in and he was asked to be put someplace else 'cause he didn't like this other horse that he had to sha- 

480.31 488.02 A: share the pasture with and or it was a he was a horse and a bull together and he didn't like it and he wanted to be put in a separate pen and 

488.23 496.26 A: and one dog who all of a sudden began to chew things up and the pet said why is he chewing things up and she said 

496.77 500.01 A: that there are some cleaning materials 

500.58 505.20 A: in in a in somewhere and the fumes were irritating 

505.37 511.22 A: the dog's breathing or throat and the only way the dog could get relief was to 

509.36 510.77 B: (( [noise] [laughter] [noise] )) 

511.55 514.86 A: chew things i guess to make saliva in her throat 

514.91 517.39 B: (( [noise] [noise] wow )) 

515.28 528.34 A: so the dog said that's the reason so the woman said you remove these cleaning or these chemicals or whatever and the dog will stop doing it so they did and the dog stopped doing it [laughter] 

527.74 528.56 B: (( [noise] )) 

529.22 531.46 A: is some of this is fascinating 

529.22 530.02 B: oh 

531.40 536.14 B: yeah that would be pretty interesting [noise] just to call and see what 

536.52 538.23 B: see what they have to say 

537.80 541.19 A: yeah you get some insight into you know 

541.38 548.23 B: [noise] i think my dogs would be pretty upset with me 'cause um i i actually live with my parents and um 

541.83 542.66 A: um 

548.30 549.54 B: my mom 

549.56 553.18 B: eats chocolate like before she goes to bed she eats m&ms 

553.16 554.61 A: [laughter] 

553.76 560.49 B: and we we don't give the dogs chocolate i mean we give 'em table scraps but we do not give them chocolate [laughter] 

559.76 563.72 A: well i don't think they're supposed to have chocolate 

562.99 569.20 B: and i think they've been kind of upset that my mom sits there all night and eats and don't give them any to 'em 

569.80 572.50 A: eating the chocolate and won't give them any huh 

572.04 576.03 B: [laughter] yeah but uh 

575.29 578.40 A: they're lucky to get table scraps i always uh 

577.78 579.42 B: yeah 

578.88 580.84 A: you know i was tough 

579.55 582.60 B: um how important was your dalmatian to you 

582.74 590.74 A: oh she was very important we we had her we got her when she was six weeks old and um 

589.60 590.52 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

591.49 599.89 A: you know she we ne- we only had the one dog and she she grew up with us and never really knew
