16.83 17.79 A: (( ah )) 

17.23 31.10 B: uh pets yeah no i don't have a pet now my family had a pet about a couple of years ago when unfortunately we had to put it to sleep a dog and it was it was so adorable you know i mean i i appreciate animals more now now more than ever 

30.69 31.59 A: yeah 

31.01 32.79 B: you know do you have a pet now 

32.45 34.16 A: yeah we have a dog 

33.58 36.25 B: oh okay what kind of dog is it 

35.71 36.78 A: it's a mutt 

36.83 42.67 A: uh probably some husky and um i don't know what else maybe a german shepherd 

42.41 45.75 B: mhm okay 'cause ours was a yorkshire terrier 

45.44 46.44 A: uh-huh 

45.97 56.45 B: and uh yeah a friend of mine she lost her dog in a in an accident and since i've known her i'm much more appreciative of dogs and animals and everything i think they're so um 

56.46 60.65 B: they're so uh perfect you know i mean they're so predictable 

60.68 62.46 A: [laughter] 

60.72 69.95 B: [laughter] and you know they're better than people generally you know because you know throughout time they acted always the same and people seem to always you never know what you're what you're going to meet up you know 

63.54 65.21 A: [laughter] 

69.63 70.87 A: yeah 

70.25 75.46 B: i mean there are variances in everything you know but uh how long have you had this dog 

75.32 77.61 A: he's about seven years old i guess 

76.97 80.36 B: oh okay because ours was about eighteen 

80.15 82.09 A: oh yeah that's pretty old for a dog 

81.49 91.90 B: yeah yeah but it was very sad you know when when when it when it was when it got sick and everything you know and uh it's very very hard to lose a pet it's traumatic 

87.28 88.42 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

91.76 92.71 A: yeah 

91.95 97.63 B: so that's uh something uh yeah so how often you take it out or anything 

97.45 100.17 A: oh sure yeah yes yes 

98.44 102.12 B: okay is it an outdoor does it like to be outdoors or 

101.52 108.35 A: uh yes he likes to be outdoors but he of course uh since he's in new york city spends most of his time inside 

107.77 111.33 B: right yeah yeah same with ours when we had it the um 

111.44 123.70 B: my friend though she has uh two dogs now and one of them loves to be indoors wouldn't care less whether it spent any time outdoors and the other one can't stand being indoors has to be outdoors all the time 

122.62 124.62 A: huh yeah [laughter] 

123.76 138.08 B: so when i went out with her i walked with her and uh the dog would would be so strong it would push her over you know and sometimes it can get to be a burden because she she doesn't want to be out twenty four hours a day she wants to sleep [laughter] and this dog only wants to be out 

135.40 136.35 A: yeah 

138.16 139.36 B: so they they 

138.29 141.49 A: yeah that can be that can be tough yeah of course we 

139.94 142.94 B: yeah so they seem to have a personality uh-huh 

142.29 148.89 A: yeah we have to organize our schedules so that somebody's uh able to walk him you know three or four times a day 

148.65 153.93 B: right yeah yeah well even with this this dog wants to be out all the time i understand when uh 

154.16 161.67 B: when um she leaves the door open sometimes the dog would actually go to the elevator and just go inside the elevator and go down the lobby 

161.48 162.36 A: oh yeah 

161.78 163.04 B: by itself 

162.44 163.66 A: [laughter] 

163.01 166.90 B: and it's a big dog it's like eighty pounds and everything but it's so 

166.86 172.71 B: cute you know and uh when i met i met her twice and the other dog 

172.65 181.51 B: and when i met her the last time they would be like uh they would be so preoccupied being outdoors both of them even the one who didn't care for being outdoors 

181.33 192.29 B: that uh they were you know preoccupied so they just kind of gave me a passing glance or something but in new york it's difficult you know because there's no open outside of central park there's no open spaces 

192.72 193.78 B: you know 

193.45 194.45 A: yeah 

193.87 196.60 B: and there's a lot of restrictions on on dogs 

196.61 199.67 B: are you near prospect park that you could take the dog out 

199.11 201.55 A: no we're in uh williamsburg 

201.36 202.88 B: (( okay )) 

201.87 210.93 A: we're not we're not uh near any very large parks so uh i guess we uh go most frequently to one called mckerron park i 

210.31 212.19 B: mhm mhm 

211.46 213.43 A: don't know if you know where that one is 

212.86 214.52 B: no um 

214.55 219.11 B: no no i'm not familiar with williamsburg i knew flatbush a little bit prospect park 

215.33 216.74 A: it's sort of uh 

219.15 228.40 B: and uh that's a good place to take dogs but you know you have to have it on a leash otherwise you're you're subject to being ticketed and um it can be rather um 

222.78 223.56 A: yeah 

229.03 234.53 B: rather difficult you know i mean they yeah they can't run loose and everything you know 

230.07 231.78 A: yeah it certainly can 

233.65 239.70 A: yeah well they the city has a few uh parks now that have dog runs that makes it a little easier 

237.58 238.77 B: mhm 

239.36 248.05 B: yeah yeah a friend of mine lives in the west teens around nineteenth street and she has a uh a park nearby i think that she brings her dog to 

239.71 240.59 A: (( uh-huh )) 

248.15 254.27 B: you know and uh no but they're so they're smart and everything are you a cat person also 

254.74 261.58 A: uh we've had cats uh over the years but um uh for the last couple of years we've just had a dog 

261.43 264.59 B: mhm right did you ever have them together [laughter] 

264.94 269.07 A: uh yeah they were together for a year or two i guess 

268.42 270.17 B: oh and they got along [laughter] 

269.70 272.25 A: yeah yeah they eventually figured it out 

271.69 276.26 B: okay 'cause i know sometimes there's a rivalry between the two you know 

272.41 273.72 A: (( it took a while )) 

275.08 280.96 A: yeah yeah it took it took some time for them to figure out how they'd get along with each other but they they managed 

279.43 280.54 B: yeah 

280.60 292.59 B: my family used to know this couple and they were this is many years ago when they supplied a lot of the dogs like steve allen's dogs and they had the whole anim- the whole house was full of animals you'd walk in and there were birds flying it's in the house 

291.96 293.97 A: (( hm hm )) 

292.63 304.27 B: you know and there was a camel there and it was just unbelievable yeah i never never saw a house like that in my life you know and it was really uh it was really nice i think the uh 

295.95 296.96 A: a camel 

304.69 316.31 B: i think animals i mean i wish they could talk they look like they could talk some of them they can i don't know if they i don't know if they understand it and we had birds you know do you have any birds in the house 

310.02 312.56 A: yeah yeah um some certainly yeah 

316.37 323.48 A: we've had birds as well uh while as our kids were growing up we've had quite uh a menagerie around the place 

323.19 324.28 B: mhm 

323.54 329.70 A: um we have a snake a rabbit lizard yeah we've had many many pets

338.69 339.82 B: uh-huh 

340.63 341.81 B: i hope so 

341.52 344.21 A: yeah so it wasn't really free but

348.90 353.54 B: you know and uh i mean you know i mean i think i think she lets them loose you know 

353.67 359.38 B: but i uh i wouldn't be too crazy about that you know but these snakes actually some snakes i mean they're 

356.71 357.46 A: yeah 

359.45 361.68 B: they're creatures like anybody else you know 

361.84 363.11 A: yeah yeah 

362.26 367.25 B: and and uh this i assume the snake was not poison uh or didn't bite or anything 

367.09 369.21 A: uh it was a boa constrictor 

369.15 370.71 B: oh my goodness 

370.92 373.19 B: i would hope you had that protected 

373.36 374.49 B: you know 

374.29 382.88 A: yeah well uh they uh if you have uh b- boa constrictors as babies as as really tiny um uh 

382.94 392.68 A: infant snakes they uh they learn to uh be around humans and don't feel so uh uh so ill at ease and uh 

391.32 394.50 B: oh okay yeah yeah 

393.85 400.31 A: they you have to a lot of uh a lot of animals uh seem to be of this uh uh kind of 

400.63 401.75 A: uh 

402.17 408.31 A: malleable state if you have them when they're young enough they uh learn to um

411.20 418.89 B: right well you see 'em when they used to be on tonight show i don't know if i don't know jay leno has them on now but he johnny carson used to have the animal trainer

419.14 431.67 B: from the santiago zoo yeah and uh you know he ha- he would have snakes go around his neck and everything you know and uh but they're but they're well trained you know i mean you can get you can get 'em to be well trained if they want to harm you i don't think 

419.49 421.44 A: oh yes yeah 

431.48 433.25 A: yeah i think so 

432.04 438.80 B: and you know but uh i wouldn't want that around the house [laughter] you know

445.01 455.52 A: so uh let me ask you a question about this uh phone uh uh experiment it's is it your understanding that uh 

450.22 451.22 B: right 

455.63 459.78 A: this is like a linguistics experiment in some fashion or 

458.44 461.18 B: right yeah yeah i think they listen to people 

459.95 463.49 A: they're building a database of people for accents or something like that 

462.55 466.93 B: right and how people talk that's what i understand right uh-huh 

467.36 468.61 B: yeah 

467.98 470.61 A: have you been in other phone conversations 

470.14 473.42 B: no no this is my first is this your first also 

471.27 473.08 A: your very first one oh 

473.09 476.47 A: no this is the third one that i've uh i've been in 

474.95 478.57 B: oh okay so i think you uh hit i think hit the jackpot with this 

478.11 480.12 A: yeah maybe so [laughter] 

478.78 484.23 B: you know and maybe maybe you can buy some y- y- y- buy some nice dog food for your dog 

483.48 485.48 A: yeah yeah that sounds right 

484.90 487.89 B: you know and that because i know we're going to be cut off any second 

487.92 492.79 B: but um uh so you've had other dogs before this 

489.16 490.00 A: (( [laughter] )) 

493.13 505.18 A: uh i myself have had dogs yeah i grew up in uh i grew up in the mid west so uh uh as a kid i've i had uh a series of pets including a couple of dogs and uh 

495.34 496.40 B: okay 

497.69 499.53 B: oh okay right 

501.79 502.84 B: yeah 

503.34 513.53 B: yeah yeah yeah no i like this topic because as i'm saying uh over the last six months eight months i've gotten much more appreciative of animals especially dogs you know 

514.01 514.83 A: yeah 

514.22 523.40 B: and uh as long as the owners clean up after the street on the streets which sometimes they don't do huh but that's important because a dog doesn't have i don't think the intelligence to uh 

518.73 519.63 A: yeah 

523.43 527.99 B: to avoid uh taking care of itself uh on the sidewalk 

528.10 530.29 B: you know that's up to the owner to uh 

530.46 539.75 B: you know to clean up but other than that i mean i think they're fantastic i used to go to central park and sunbathe and it got on my nerves when a dog would run into me [laughter] you know 

531.81 532.61 A: yeah 

539.81 540.92 A: yeah 

540.31 544.94 B: but uh they have to uh they should keep them on a leash though in a park there's too many people there 

545.04 550.40 B: you see but uh yes it's interesting you have snakes and everything you know 

545.55 546.79 A: yeah 

550.85 553.77 B: you've you you had a snake and a dog at the same time 

554.96 557.03 A: uh 

557.25 561.05 A: i'm not sure about the chronology uh of that but uh 

559.18 560.22 B: oh 

560.27 564.02 B: i'd love to know the relationship whether they got along or something you know 

563.14 573.47 A: i uh i can't just remember how how long ago we uh we had this thing whether it was before before the dog or you know in the early years of the dog but it didn't you know they never 

571.24 572.50 B: okay 

573.27 579.25 A: really i i think they probably didn't overlap i can't remember any uh incidents with the two of them 

578.90 581.08 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

579.20 588.97 A: uh but uh they they probably wouldn't have occupied uh much common space you know the uh snake was never really out of its cage 

588.79 589.86 B: mhm 

589.27 594.66 A: um and uh the dog um doesn't seem to pay much attention to stuff uh 

590.34 591.48 B: (( mhm )) 

594.39 595.54 B: (( mm )) 

594.96 596.80 A: uh above 

597.25 599.89 A: you know wh- uh human waist height or so [laughter]
