139.37 140.66 B: oh really 

143.62 144.66 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

144.35 155.80 A: so we decided instead of for going for the goldfish we'll get some guppies or uh some other kind of fish so we got two of them [laughter] 'cause we didn't how they were gonna survive you know 

155.15 156.09 B: uh-huh 

155.94 163.97 A: and one of the fish uh had babies uh about three months ago so now we got like seven little babies running around you know

166.38 169.19 A: well that's about we'll just have to get a bigger tank 

168.41 171.80 B: [laughter] guppies are pretty prolific if i remember correctly 

169.36 177.64 A: [laughter] oh yeah oh yeah and that uh other fish is just gigantic now the bottom feeder 

172.16 172.82 B: (( yeah )) 

177.30 178.37 B: oh yeah 

177.81 181.81 A: but he keeps the place nice and clean so that's the main thing 

180.19 182.65 B: [laughter] i had one of those fighting fish 

183.44 185.51 A: you got one you had one of those 

184.74 186.54 B: yeah those are kinda cool 

186.04 189.41 A: yeah they they're beautiful mhm 

186.59 189.48 B: especially if you hold a mirror up to 'em 

189.50 195.84 B: [laughter] and they they flare out and they'd they you know they think it's another fish that they're supposed to fight 

191.73 206.38 A: mhm yeah well we at christmas time they were selling them in at the stores down here it's a survey [noise] and they had all kinds of you know 

196.33 199.00 B: but ah they're kinda pretty i kinda like 'em but 

201.61 202.50 B: yeah 

206.27 210.81 A: different you know colors and but they were all pretty really all pretty 

208.05 209.18 B: pretty aren't they 

209.96 218.88 B: yeah yeah that's what i wanna well i did one of these things where you take um a big flower vase and you fill it with water and then you um have this 

218.80 230.28 B: clear plastic thing up in the neck of the vase and you put a flower down through a hole in it and so the fish kind of swims around inside the the roots of th- the flower and oh it looks kinda cool [laughter] 

220.77 223.35 A: (( mhm )) 

229.85 238.98 A: yeah i see that at one of the decorating shows they actually had it as a they had a couple hanging from the ceiling 'cause they don't need very much uh space to to go 

233.05 234.05 B: yeah 

235.42 238.01 B: yeah it's a challenge to feed 'em though 

239.82 244.17 B: [laughter] and let's see what else have i had we used to have four rabbits 

243.83 245.42 A: (( wow [laughter] )) 

245.47 248.96 A: they're uh they're tough little pets those rabbits [mn] 

245.49 247.14 B: my daughter actually 

248.09 255.13 B: they're fun sometimes well they each have their personality we when my daughter was quite small uh she wanted a pet and we lived 

255.08 264.28 B: in a busy part of the city so it didn't make sense to have a cat or a dog 'cause they'd get hit by a car you know so i thought okay we'll get a rabbit and keep it in the house 'cause you can house train 'em 

259.89 260.82 A: uh-huh 

264.39 268.51 B: and unfortunately this rabbit was um a killer rabbit 

267.90 269.66 A: [laughter] 

268.52 272.95 B: [laughter] you'd get anywhere near her and she would actually bark at you [laughter] it 

272.04 273.99 A: well yeah 

273.23 277.59 B: didn't turn out to be the fu- warm fuzzy little pet that we had hoped for 

277.53 290.03 A: yeah i guess if they're kinda they're kinda ch- i mean like on easter time that's when all the little kids want 'em and we uh and we have a backyard and there was this brown tailed rabbit jumping around out there so 

277.83 278.62 B: (( ah )) 

282.49 283.44 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

290.04 295.63 A: we were kinda afraid that he would not be getting any food this winter so we were giving him 

295.51 305.20 A: lettuce and we went and bought some food for him but he would just run he would yeah i see him very often every every once in a while you see him in the backyard jumping around 

298.34 299.25 B: yeah 

304.34 312.73 B: yeah they're fun i i know a woman that um raises rabbits for show eventually w- with my daughter we got other another kind of rabbit and she was showing them 

312.40 314.10 A: mhm 

312.74 323.67 B: so i met this other woman that lived uh pretty far out into the country and any other rabbits that weren't good enough to show she just released them into the wild and she i think she probably had ten acres 

323.16 325.06 A: mhm 

323.58 337.23 B: and so you'd walk around out there and um in amongst you know her her other animals that had you'd see all these little rabbits 'cause and they were a real small variety the ones that only get to about two pounds [laughter] so it was like easter out there every day 

327.25 330.50 A: [laughter] 

332.34 334.21 A: (( [noise] mhm ))
