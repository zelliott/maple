103.87 105.82 B: oh oh [laughter] 

104.33 108.28 A: it's bizarre [laughter] but they say these little dogs do that 

108.30 109.37 A: you know 

108.57 110.83 B: oh is that the deal with little dogs 

110.02 113.02 A: i don't know that's what i've been told you know i- it's 

112.04 114.66 B: ah that's why i have a big dog [laughter] 

113.75 128.07 A: well yeah exactly you know i've always had in my in the past i've always had huge dogs you know i've always had a shar-pei or you know bigger shepherds and that stuff and this one here it's just been oh my goodness it's such a hard [laughter] it's a challenge [laughter] 

122.75 123.64 B: right 

127.45 132.03 B: well i know like um one of my cats got really upset when the dog moved in 

132.01 132.98 A: uh-huh 

132.18 134.28 B: and you can buy this spray 

134.34 143.34 B: that at least for cats you can buy it and they can smell it and we can't but it's it's supposed to calm them down and it keeps them from marking territory 

136.52 137.61 A: right 

143.05 143.88 A: huh 

143.62 146.21 B: so i wonder if there's a comparable thing for dogs 

145.89 157.50 A: oh you know there's so much out there for these animals i'm sure i sometimes i think that we take better care of our [laughter] animals than we do with our kids it's so it's um isn't it amazing so you don't know how long your your little guest is going to be staying huh 

152.32 153.32 B: (( i know )) 

154.56 155.59 B: yeah 

157.62 160.08 A: well do you live out do have a big house or oh

165.12 171.40 A: well that's nice well that's that's all right though so that's not too bad so you got two cats and th- one dog or two dogs 

165.74 167.91 B: but not yeah it helps 

171.32 176.62 B: no just one dog and i do have a back yard not an enormous one but 

172.30 173.56 A: just one dog 

176.76 178.53 B: um i help 

178.20 181.40 A: right now are your cats outside cats or are they inside cats 

178.84 179.58 B: so 

181.12 183.23 B: (( yeah and i have cat doors for them )) 

183.60 185.97 A: and you don't mind your cats running around like that 

186.10 188.24 A: like aren't you afraid they're gonna get killed or something 

188.27 192.77 B: um the cat doors lead directly out into the back yard 

191.69 193.76 A: and they don't leave the back yard 

193.58 197.07 B: they don't tend to one of my cats is about a hundred years old 

196.83 199.13 A: [laughter] 

197.74 200.52 B: so she's pretty much not going anywhere 

199.93 201.73 A: right [laughter] 

200.53 204.12 B: and if she dies well it's kind of her her time 

203.54 208.18 A: her destiny i guess [laughter] oh that's kind of neat 

204.67 205.78 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

206.76 219.08 B: and yeah the other one tends to like she really gets frightened by loud noises so she stays away from cars but she just stays you know it goes right out to the back yard so she sits in my back yard and my neighbor's back yard so 

211.87 212.83 A: mhm 

218.74 230.20 A: yeah cats are i i just never understand them because i see the i know our neighborhood has so many cats around here and they're all over the place and at night you hear them fight and i think oh my god i would be so worried 

230.16 243.49 A: if i had a cat and i heard the screeching all night and the oh and they always come home wou- wounded i know my one girlfriend next door her cat always comes home [laughter] wounded like from catfights at night and i think oh i would be devastated 

243.65 249.21 B: yeah my one cat actually um the dog next door got well this was when i lived somewhere else 

248.91 249.85 A: mhm

268.91 269.87 B: right 

278.34 284.12 A: and i think oh if she ever got hold of my little dog she would rip her to shreds [laughter]
