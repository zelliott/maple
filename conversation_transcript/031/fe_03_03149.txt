268.12 277.57 B: in so i i i didn't and i i really had- i'd been so busy my son drives away for the month and so i've been kind of preoccupied and hadn't really thought about it

298.87 301.30 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

300.14 303.97 B: she does not like me for some reason it's so funny 

302.98 303.76 A: (( oh )) 

304.04 310.38 B: every time i go there she just looks at me and if i say something she runs she doesn't like my voice or something 

310.13 312.14 A: [laughter] 

310.62 315.88 B: she's scarred of me it's funny because it's so obvious that she doesn't like me 

315.61 326.18 A: mhm i wonder if maybe you remind her of someone from her past [laughter] that mistreated her or something [laughter] 

320.08 322.10 B: i don't know but she 

322.40 325.44 B: (( does not like me i don't know )) 

325.80 332.16 B: i mean she does not like my voice i think it's 'cause every time i go over there my uncle makes him go out in the back yard 

331.86 332.82 A: uh-huh 

332.63 335.69 B: and she thinks oh it's that loud girl and i gotta go outside 

333.69 338.51 A: oh so she's got that association with you [laughter] 

337.25 339.67 B: [laughter] 

338.61 342.23 A: like this woman means trouble [laughter] 

340.77 343.63 B: (( that's right she makes me go outside )) 

343.01 344.17 A: mhm 

344.49 347.97 A: but ah it's neat how animals react to different people 

348.71 353.07 B: oh i know my friend she has a lab no a golden retriever 

353.20 354.14 A: mhm 

353.41 363.42 B: and she okay kind of like when animals sense that you don't really it's not that i dislike him but i don't like him to jump on me and on me and that kind of stuff 

363.22 364.31 A: right 

363.80 367.45 B: and so of course that makes them all want to come to me 

367.69 373.57 B: and my friend's golden retriever she always wants to jump all over me well she has a friend 

373.60 381.34 B: she lets her she loves it but she's blonde and this ah golden retriever does not like blondes and 

381.66 396.18 B: she did the same thing she like totally ignored her one night she kept going come here come here and she would just totally stick her nose in the air it was hysterical and she would come to me and i didn't want her to come to me 

392.20 393.14 A: (( [laughter] oh )) 

395.97 397.13 A: [laughter] 

396.23 400.82 B: so it was funny because they got their own little personalities you know 

399.53 400.68 A: yeah 

401.83 402.87 A: (( hm )) 

403.38 405.54 B: i guess they probably talk about humans 

405.56 406.35 B: [laughter] 

406.24 408.23 A: maybe [laughter] 

409.12 410.36 A: i wonder what 

409.29 410.54 B: in their language 

410.55 417.83 A: yeah you always wonder what's going on in their little doggy brains whenever they act certain ways or [laughter] do something or 

417.40 418.61 B: yeah 

418.18 420.89 A: dreaming you can tell when they're dreaming and 

421.52 422.53 A: (( stuff )) 

423.16 424.34 B: have you had 

424.59 425.91 A: i'm sorry what 

427.53 428.92 B: no go ahead i'm sorry 

428.89 431.93 A: my phone keeps cutting out i'm on my cell phone so 

430.64 433.02 B: (( yeah so does mine i am too )) 

434.37 440.92 A: but yeah my sister's got a dog and he's some kind of mix i don't know what [laughter] but

448.57 449.41 B: (( uh-huh )) 

455.25 470.13 A: um and so i gather the owner dropped him off there because she just couldn't take care of him he was too much trouble for her and so he's just crazy [laughter] he wants to jump on you and lick you and you can't you can't 

462.85 463.85 B: right 

469.40 470.60 B: is he real big 

470.61 477.57 A: he is i mean he's still really young we don't we're not sure how old exactly how old he is because he's from the shelter 

477.43 478.44 B: right 

477.75 485.10 A: and so but we know he's still a puppy and he's pretty big [laughter] he looks like some kind of um 

485.75 491.45 A: like collie and maybe a lab or golden retriever mix or something 'cause 

491.27 492.11 B: uh-huh 

491.65 494.69 A: he's got this really long body
