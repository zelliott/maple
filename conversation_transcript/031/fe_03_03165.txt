128.19 140.07 A: and um i mean it's h- hard you've got to keep you've got to really take care of them uh there's they always sometimes they have accidents and they'll they'll start bleeding and you have to immediately get something or take him to the vet it's expense- expensive you know 

139.80 141.13 B: (( oh )) 

140.70 142.96 A: (( they're work you have it's a lot of worrying )) 

142.76 144.64 B: well what made you get a bird [noise] 

144.64 158.10 A: oh because i don't we had a bird before and we had a bird before and one of them ran away one died i mean so i don't know my brother said hey let's go get a bird so i said fine let's go get a bird and we went and bought one 

158.55 163.70 A: and it was like i mean it so i like it it's fun you know and you've got something to play with but 

163.19 167.96 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] do you have to um like clean its cage every day or

179.59 185.12 A: yeah i'm not i'm not i've never had a cat so i don't know what to uh what it's you do a litter box is where they go to the bathroom and every- 

184.24 190.76 B: [noise] yeah you know that's why i got 'em actually because cats are easier to take care of than dogs you don't have to train them 

190.05 204.98 A: yeah yeah with my bird you have to train him to train him to whistle you have to whistle to them constantly and i can't whistle my brother can so my brother taught him this one whistle and he does it every day and it's annoying because he only knows [noise] one whistle so far and it's like a real quick whistle but it's really funny so

226.78 232.33 A: uh we went looking around like you know as a child so i was like really devastated and i was like looking around for him maybe looking at the 

232.34 243.57 A: light poles maybe he was on top of a pole somewhere on the block outside and two hours later i come back to my door i was like you know i gave up i'm like oh i'm never going to find him and he was waiting in the front of my door 

243.38 244.68 B: wow 

244.20 245.81 A: yeah i was amazed 

246.47 257.52 A: so i mean i found him i i came up to my walk to him uh he jumped on my finger and once we took him back inside i guess he by instinct he knew where my house was 'cause it was in the i let him go in the backyard by accident and he came in to the front of the house

271.89 272.73 A: uh-huh 

276.37 277.67 A: (( oh really )) 

277.13 278.33 B: yeah and um 

279.08 280.07 B: uh 

279.93 294.13 B: the cats the cats they get territorial you know they like one person in the house and that's you know the one whoever they pick to like that's who they like and they don't have you know they'll do whatever they the person they like tells them to do the rest of the time they won't do what anybody else tells them to do 

286.97 288.14 A: oh really 

293.42 294.98 A: (( oh wow i never knew that )) 

294.23 294.85 B: (( yeah )) 

295.20 296.37 B: they um 

296.81 305.36 B: i i just figured out they shed a lot hair god do they shed some hair i should brush 'em more often but i don't you know so you get hair all over the place 

299.20 300.33 A: (( oh really )) 

305.68 310.39 B: and i you know i never thought i would get used to that but i kind of like 

305.75 306.56 A: wow 

310.27 311.52 A: like the cat 

310.88 320.40 B: yeah uh you know i really you know there's one of them that's really funny yeah you know it's a really active cat and one of them i think is psychotic you know because you very seldom see that one 

320.12 321.14 A: yeah 

320.50 323.55 B: and uh they play with each other but you know 

323.67 332.28 B: [noise] you know like your bird you only have one bird and i would think uh the reason i have more than one cat is 'cause i thought that that you know the cat was lonely so i thought i'd get him a playmate 

330.29 331.14 A: yeah 

332.21 341.52 A: yeah they told us they told us when we bought the bird don't buy two birds because if you buy another bird then they won't pay attention to you they're just going to be you know together they're going to pay attention to themselves 

341.20 342.97 B: oh 

342.25 349.66 A: yeah that's the thing that's why we didn't buy two but also we had two doves about a month ago and we just gave them away because tow 

348.75 349.80 B: two dogs 

349.98 351.22 A: no two doves 

350.92 351.95 B: (( doves ))

352.04 353.74 B: oh wow 

353.12 364.62 A: yeah they're real nice birds and they're i felt sorry for them because they kept on laying eggs and they laid probably in the time we had them they laid probably twenty eggs and never none of them wanted not even one of them hatched ever and 

364.08 365.85 B: [laughter] 

364.69 369.16 A: they would always sleep on them you know like rest on them and heat 'em up and keep 'em warm but they'd never hatch so 

368.51 369.80 B: and they never hatched 

369.42 376.18 A: they never hatched they would and then they never hatched so they would break it i guess and i felt sorry for them you know but then we gave them away 

375.28 376.78 B: oh my goodness 

377.09 378.53 B: did they make a lot of noise 

377.17 377.91 A: very 

378.24 380.49 A: no those doves are real quiet 

380.93 384.50 A: but the cockatiel is the complete opposite he's really noisy 

385.09 394.30 A: wakes up in the mor- wakes you up in the morning like uh i get sometimes he wakes me up at ei- i'm like all the way across the room in like another room i with all the doors closed i can still hear him so then 

394.18 405.61 A: he real loud whistles so i'll take him i'll put him in a room and then close him close the door and he and i know i'm going to hear him but it's real hard to yeah it's real hard with him do you ever your cats don't make any noises huh 

400.41 401.42 B: (( wow )) 

405.18 406.88 B: [sigh] um 

407.05 419.87 B: no well in the morning they do they'll you know when they know you supposed to be up then they'll stand at the door and meow and they'll meow meow meow 'til you finally get up and then they'll stop it's like they

415.17 416.12 A: (( all right )) 

417.66 418.62 A: yeah 

419.77 430.33 B: they get used to whatever schedule you keep then that's the schedule they get used to so if you're not coming out of the room when they think you should then you know then they'll start meowing but otherwise they're they're quiet 

425.43 426.34 A: wow 

430.28 431.36 A: (( all right yeah yeah )) 

430.78 433.11 B: but they're inquisitive so

437.73 442.57 B: uh one of 'em likes to knock cups of water over so you've got to watch your cup of water 

443.06 450.51 A: we my my cousin had a cat she she had a couple of cats who they were were actua- they live in the they live in a mountain 

450.68 458.75 A: they're living on like a mountain residential area and and some stray not stray cats wild cats i believe came 

458.61 466.39 A: and like my cousin would feed them every d- every day i guess and then they soon became her cats from you know wild cats became hers 

461.76 462.61 B: uh-huh 

466.22 476.72 A: and she became real attached to them and it was real interesting because like you know a cat has nowhere to no no one owned the cat it was you know just some wild cat it was black and it was a real interesting cat what i remember of it and then 

476.62 486.45 A: she was real close to it and it didn't like me 'cause whenever i came once i guess i did something to it and and it and it had sniffed my hand or whatever you know you know what i mean how it sniffs your hand and remembers 

485.62 487.26 B: yeah 

486.49 491.18 A: yeah it sniffed my hand and it remembered me and like every time it would see me it would get real angry at me or something 

490.57 492.27 B: oh no [sigh]

497.40 500.27 B: now that that's true no that that's true 

500.08 502.98 A: yeah she was real close to it and it died i guess and then 

503.19 508.49 A: that hurt but it had children so now i guess i don't know what's happened i haven't talked to her in a while i don't think they are there any more 

508.04 509.37 B: (( yeah oh )) 

509.00 511.02 A: yeah they disappeared or something 

511.11 518.93 B: yeah my cats don't go outside because i declawed them and so you can't if you get declawed cats you can't let it outside because otherwise it can't protect itself 

516.95 518.09 A: does declaw 

518.51 519.68 A: what is that

525.56 539.16 B: yeah so they won't 'cause otherwise you know they scratch the furniture or they they'll find a per- the spot that they want to sharpen their claws on and that's what they'll use and so you have to you know declaw them when they're young you don't have to worry about that 

534.50 535.72 A: oh really 

538.66 540.27 A: (( how do you declaw them mm )) 

539.70 541.82 B: they had we had to take them to the vet
