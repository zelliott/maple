181.49 187.89 A: i was also surprised at when when i bought the guinea pig i bought the guinea pig before doing any research which you know 

187.99 189.30 B: yeah 

188.35 192.18 A: i've known i've kept pets since i was a little kid so

193.94 195.56 A: but i um 

197.22 209.08 A: you know i didn't do any research i figured oh just like a hamster 'cause i'd had hamsters before and i thought guinea a guinea pig's not a chi- not a rodent like a hamster it's a different category of animals 

209.30 213.79 A: and they need fresh vegetables and uh 

214.07 220.62 A: stuff like that every day you know you got to give give 'em straw to chew on and nu- nus nustian and straw 

219.71 221.28 B: so it's a lot of work 

220.96 230.15 A: yeah whereas a hamster is just like a handful of pellets throw 'em in the cage you know that's all you need to really do to keep it keep it fed and happy 

225.18 226.13 B: right 

230.01 231.71 B: and how long do they live 

231.35 234.12 A: uh five to seven years 

234.34 238.32 B: that's a good long time i didn't know when i got my dog that they lived 

235.26 236.13 A: right 

238.40 241.40 B: like twenty years and sometimes more 

240.53 241.28 A: (( mm )) 

242.47 247.44 B: i made quite a commitment 'cause i wasn't quite aware that i would be making [laughter] 

248.84 252.68 A: yeah dogs uh live a lot longer than they used to nowadays 

252.25 254.44 B: and the little breeds live longer 

254.60 256.57 A: (( mhm )) 

255.74 257.35 B: (( oh i didn't know that i didn't either )) 

257.83 263.62 B: i was twenty i'm going to have the dog living with me longer than my children i hope 

263.69 264.73 B: (( [laughter] )) 

264.10 265.64 A: yeah that's uh 

266.80 268.06 A: um

278.17 282.34 B: yeah that's what my brother did too that's why i hope i don't [laughter] 

281.80 284.73 A: they uh well i'm bu- i'm buying it off 'em now 

284.62 285.86 B: oh okay

290.86 291.83 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

291.51 298.18 A: yeah those are good i you know i i specially found that out after my parents moved out like wow 

296.56 299.53 B: [noise] it's nice to be alone [laughter] 

300.61 303.00 B: so just the guinea pig nothing else huh 

302.88 304.09 A: yeah 

304.20 308.26 A: i had a hamster until a few days ago but i had to bury her

313.39 316.35 A: yeah two to three years is uh normal 

315.96 319.69 B: oh that's a long time it seems like my kids want a hamster 

319.95 323.14 B: i don't really i don't want rodents in the house 

322.87 329.27 A: well the hamsters are are okay you just have to realize that they are 

329.50 332.38 A: if you get one they're going to be uh 

332.81 336.68 A: very active and they're going to want to 

336.90 340.79 A: escape whatever bounds you put them in and explore the house 

340.43 346.16 B: and don't they also like aren't they active at night don't they make a lot of noise at night 

343.69 344.76 A: yeah

355.27 361.64 B: [noise] i don't i i think i'm not up for that challenge [laughter] and i think i'm aware of my limitations 

359.03 359.95 A: yeah 

360.97 365.10 A: well the good thing about a hamster is like i said if you don't like it it'll be dead soon 

364.60 365.99 B: [laughter] 

366.29 371.64 A: especially around kids when i was a kid my hamsters always escaped and drowned in something 

371.71 373.95 B: (( oh do you know what we have a goldfish )) 

374.90 378.12 B: that we got at a fair in january

381.67 386.89 B: and i know like two weeks later my daughter says to me what are we going to do when the dog dies 

387.02 399.84 B: i'm like oh he's going to be alive for so long she said mommy don't you know pets die and then it occurred to me that all the other kids in her class that had won the goldfish their fish had died [noise] and so i thought oh it's coming soon it's coming soon

463.90 464.84 B: no 

465.05 479.98 B: [noise] no it's just with my son when we were talking about him we spoke spanish so [noise] he wouldn't understand so we taught him spanish effectively and my daughter my daughter we were talk- when we would talk about her we spoke in german so she's learned german 

473.24 474.80 A: [laughter] 

480.03 481.51 B: first we spelled

483.58 486.30 B: then we spoke german so then she learned german 

486.69 493.57 B: and now we then we switched to spanish and the baby learned spanish and the big one is learning it now too 

493.43 502.73 A: [laughter] so you've got like uh uh a multi lingual household how do you how did you have so many languages to speak to begin with 

497.12 499.63 B: we have a multi lingual household 

502.02 507.26 B: well my parents had done the same thing and i didn't realize that [laughter] that it would fail 

507.31 513.07 B: i guess it didn't fail i mean it certainly it's a nice benefit to have you know have a lot of languages but 

513.16 514.66 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

513.76 524.77 A: yeah it'll it'll give them uh if they if they think about if they think about all the different words in all the different languages too they'll learn they'll teach themselves more about how language is constructed 

523.96 529.19 B: [noise] yeah you don't know your own language until you know someone else's that's definitely true 

529.20 531.13 B: [noise] yeah they 

531.48 537.57 B: they definitely have an advantage there [noise] sometimes sometimes they can't find a babysitter you know

559.77 560.60 B: (( you know )) 

560.71 564.69 B: [noise] 'cause they still mess it up and you're like wondering which language [noise] you're listening for 

565.27 566.08 B: (( so )) 

566.84 573.41 A: well it's pretty neat actually hopefully it'll stay with them while they're older 

569.28 570.14 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah ))
