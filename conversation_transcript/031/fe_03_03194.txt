167.34 168.85 A: um they um 

169.43 175.72 A: [noise] first of all [noise] i think one of the i turned it up you can hear it [noise] one of the 

175.94 177.88 A: one of the boys the littlest one 

177.90 182.45 A: [noise] [noise] got the hamster and he'd the hamster bit him and was hanging on to his finger 

182.01 183.85 B: (( mhm )) 

182.62 189.78 A: and he was trying to shake it off and stuff but he had already been torturing him enough then they smashed the same poor [noise] hamster under 

189.93 192.19 A: the mattress in his bed 

191.76 193.08 B: (( oh [noise] oh jeeze )) 

192.48 194.39 A: and kind of broke his leg 

194.47 198.68 A: and so that poor hamster's limping along he can barely walk then 

198.70 199.67 A: um 

199.81 201.69 A: not too long after that 

201.81 205.42 A: and this was after the hamster bit him but they're still brave enough to get him 

205.50 217.85 A: they come running outside to tell me the hamster was on the railroad tracks and they have a whole bunch of little train sets and stuff and so i come running in to see where what they're talking about i have a railroad track set up above 

211.28 212.42 B: (( oh i see [noise] )) 

218.16 225.08 A: in their room up by the ceiling that goes up around their room at the above so they can use it with a remote 

220.52 221.78 B: yeah 

224.81 226.16 B: oh i see 

225.74 228.40 A: they had thrown the hamster 

228.44 230.44 A: up there on the railroad tracks 

230.83 235.85 A: had thrown him with the tail grabbed him by the tail and flipped him up in the air and he landed up there 

235.64 237.01 B: (( [noise] [mn] jeeze )) 

236.01 238.65 A: that's the same hamster that had a broken leg 

238.77 240.88 A: (( so um needless to say )) 

239.78 241.77 B: so did he get hit by the train or 

241.56 243.34 A: no the train wasn't going 

243.14 245.61 B: oh well that's good at least 

243.60 244.83 A: it was just that the 

245.02 248.24 A: well yeah but the poor little hamster's just laying up there going 

248.46 256.02 A: you know my sister said he's probably trying to commit suicide he probably was looking for a noose up there to say get me out of this house this is horrible 

252.88 253.84 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

256.06 259.05 B: (( yeah )) 

256.67 257.46 A: [noise] but 

258.18 263.28 A: but yeah they're not very well taken care of thanks to my boys so my 

263.45 266.02 A: my thought is i'm going to move them into a different room 

266.12 268.55 A: and keep them [noise] off limits to them until they're 

269.20 270.50 A: till the boys are 

270.52 272.27 B: right 

270.89 272.64 A: [noise] responsible enough 

272.47 275.48 B: well i've got two sisters they're like eight and ten 

275.76 280.31 B: and they take pretty good care of the cats but like when they were younger when we first got cats 

280.50 281.86 B: like oh i don't know 

282.21 293.50 B: four years ago or something sometimes they'd sort of torture them and stuff like that but i think they sort of like grown up them so they see them i don't know a little more 

287.67 288.55 A: yeah 

291.77 292.48 A: as 

292.86 294.77 A: yeah they probably see them as 

293.52 294.76 B: normal i guess 

295.54 298.12 A: well yeah and they're probably like family 

298.77 304.59 A: yeah um yeah 'cause some friends were telling me about their younger kids 

303.03 306.24 B: (( yeah )) 

304.80 306.80 A: you know before i mean even 

306.86 315.45 A: you know like at ages six and seven how they would torture even the dogs and [noise] all that how they'd catch them 

314.52 317.68 B: usually it's like the cats that are torturing other animals 

317.82 319.09 A: (( yeah yeah [noise] )) 

318.35 328.55 B: like uh last two a couple of weeks ago i guess my room's in the basement and there's like a window right outside at ground level and i heard this like banging around outside the window 

328.78 333.25 B: and i ran out there and the cat had like a little rabbit and it was like 

332.65 333.61 A: oh 

333.61 345.11 B: it was like shaking around so i had to sort of extricate the rabbit and i don't know i guess i took all the cats inside and left the rabbit there and eventually i think it sort of limped away so 

335.24 336.16 A: [laughter] 

337.58 338.78 A: oh no 

344.50 345.85 A: (( oh it's )) 

346.24 351.09 B: sometimes they'll do that they'll bring you know a bird or whatever to the doorstep or something 

346.26 347.13 A: sad 

349.69 363.81 A: yeah well and that's nature they're supposed to do that kids though aren't supposed to do it other animals are suppo- that's why i keep thinking i should just let those hamsters out in the wild and let them get eaten naturally you know that way they won't be 

352.59 354.12 B: yeah 

355.04 356.23 B: [laughter] 

363.77 364.98 A: (( suffering you )) 

364.51 365.99 B: [laughter] 

365.07 367.58 A: know we've got a lot of cats in the neighborhood i'm sure they would 

367.75 369.44 A: they would be happy to 

368.90 370.33 B: yeah probably 

369.69 370.94 A: take care of them 

371.25 376.10 A: i found a couple of um baby birds just laying in the driveway the other day 

376.00 376.89 B: (( mm )) 

376.35 383.60 A: um little tiny ones i'm sure they were dead and then this the u- ugly thing was the next day they weren't there 

383.76 386.32 A: so i'm thinking the cats must have 

386.57 388.12 A: just had them for dinner 

387.79 389.28 B: yeah probably 

388.65 390.02 A: they must be like a 

390.20 391.52 A: like a um 

391.81 393.65 A: (( kind of like sushi you know like a )) 

393.45 394.16 B: (( [noise] or )) 

393.77 396.42 A: a luxury treat or something for the 

395.85 397.70 B: exotic sort of thing 

397.03 402.10 A: yeah this baby tiny birds they might taste better than big birds 

402.59 404.84 A: yuck no feathers to deal with 

404.54 406.79 B: so you have to serve a little appetizer 

406.42 408.24 A: (( ugh yeah yeah ugh )) 

408.65 410.71 A: we used to have parakeets too 

410.15 414.02 B: [mn] oh yeah just how many 

411.07 413.02 A: yeah um 

413.49 414.78 A: we had two 

414.93 418.90 A: and one of those was named alicia too like i said my kids aren't very creative 

418.43 419.60 B: [laughter] 

418.97 433.22 A: um and the other one what was his name i don't know but anyway one flew away because the cage fell that was my fault [noise] though i think i was bringing a broom by it or something and knocked the [noise] cage down and the boys had the door open in the cage and the 

428.80 429.52 B: (( mm )) 

433.30 437.71 A: bird flew two both of them flew away but we caught one [noise] and the other one got away 

437.84 441.25 A: um but the boys never touched those so we didn't have to worry about 

440.92 443.37 B: oh those could probably bite even more 

442.78 445.33 A: oh yeah yeah and 

444.52 446.50 B: yeah 

445.57 448.64 A: but they're a lot more fragile too if you think about it i guess 

447.95 450.99 B: that's true probably escape easier though 

448.83 450.73 A: (( because they're i mean they're parakeets )) 

450.91 455.16 A: yeah but they yeah that's true if they can get away yes 

454.44 456.51 B: right 

455.25 456.45 A: but um 

457.20 462.67 A: [noise] they um [noise] so the one that stayed both boys said it was theirs that 

462.76 467.73 A: no it was the other boy's that flew away [noise] you know mine mine is the one that stayed the other one flew away 

464.92 466.02 B: oh i see 

468.16 471.25 A: but we had them for quite a while and finally the other one died 

471.48 473.59 B: oh just of old age 

473.03 475.71 A: yeah yeah because we had them for quite a while 

475.81 484.06 A: yeah because i got them when the boys first started talking because that was one of my boys' first words was bird so i said cool i'll get you a bird 

481.18 483.57 B: (( mm oh that's good )) 

484.64 490.18 A: so [noise] but they never really played with those so they survived poor animals [noise] but 

488.00 489.33 B: [laughter] 

493.28 498.12 A: then you know those poor hamsters don't stand or gerbils is what they are don't stand a chance 

496.80 497.78 B: yeah 

498.40 501.78 A: [noise] so i think we'll refrain from pets for a while 

501.52 506.30 B: maybe just give it a little break till they're older think that's a good idea 

503.17 507.41 A: yeah yeah and i been wanting something i mean [noise] i love 

507.54 514.27 A: i love dogs and so i'd love to get them like a little puppy but there's no way [noise] i wouldn't they'd 

508.83 509.64 B: (( mm oh )) 

514.75 517.65 A: they'd torture a puppy really bad too i know they would [noise] 

518.49 521.17 A: right now they're still kind of scared of dogs 

520.96 524.92 B: they can be pretty scary sort of bound over to you and everything 

524.32 535.48 A: yeah and i don't know they're just they don't know what they'll do and they're not used to them so when they [noise] see you know somebody walking one in the park or something they'll go up and try to pet it but they're still kind of timid when they go by them so 

533.50 534.54 B: right 

535.54 539.98 A: but i know if they had one they'd get used to it real quick and i'm sure they'd 

538.99 545.92 B: dogs tend to really like want to like interact more and sort of play fetch and that sort of thing as opposed to cats more on their own 

544.40 545.33 A: yeah 

545.60 550.83 A: well and the cats because we have a lot of cats in the ne- neighborhood and they hang out in our yard for some reason 

550.50 551.36 B: (( mm )) 

550.98 551.88 A: um 

552.34 560.71 A: and so do the dogs too actually now that i think about it but the cats that hang out in our yard the boys when they see them will run outside and chase them 

560.40 561.51 B: [laughter] 

561.42 565.15 A: and so they go running and jumping over the fence so 

565.37 569.25 A: [noise] they're not scared of the cats either i mean i think if a cat came close to them 

569.57 570.95 A: or you know just even 

571.43 575.86 A: i don't know came close enough to almost touch them or something they'd get scared 

575.44 577.39 B: yeah 

575.98 581.21 A: but cats won't they'll run away right away whereas the dogs will sit there and let them come up [noise] to them 

582.04 594.95 B: i don't know there's not like a whole lot of other cats in our neighborhood sometimes we'll see like one and they'll come over and they'll be sort of like a little fight between the cats and sometimes you got to separate them but just like a couple of other ones i think like on our block 

593.97 596.97 A: do your cats the three of yours fight at all 

596.93 599.20 B: no not like with each other really 

598.48 599.26 A: right
