117.19 119.29 B: ah but dogs are funny you know 

119.35 132.13 B: they sleep a lot you know if there's nothing going on and like if i'm working or something they'll just go lay down and go to sleep whether they're inside or outside it doesn't make much difference and they get up you know if somebody comes by or 

121.35 122.33 A: yeah 

132.21 136.19 B: if i call 'em or something or wanna play with 'em or something they'll you know 

136.49 150.14 B: cooperate with that but it's amazing they just sleep ah dogs sleep more than you'd ever imagine you know people worry about leaving their dogs you know and going off to work and they always will act like you know they're real 

138.00 139.20 A: (( yeah )) 

145.53 146.43 A: uh-huh 

146.91 148.06 A: yeah

153.51 154.38 A: [laughter] 

154.45 167.78 B: ah from having these dogs around me all the time i can tell that that most of the time all they do is sleep [laughter] i don't know how they sleep so much i mean you know they sleep most all all night long and then ah 

167.54 169.87 B: they'll get up in the morning when i get up 

170.21 181.91 B: and ah ah you know we'll kind of play around a little bit and i feed 'em and put outside and then they walk back in and when they come back in they go lay down and go back to sleep 

181.23 183.10 A: uh-huh so do you have [mn] 

182.04 192.69 B: you know and i was you know they been sleeping all night and then you know unless i wanna play with if i if i pay a lot of attention to 'em they'll you know mess around but they're kind of used to my routine so 

183.79 186.50 A: (( hm )) 

192.70 207.57 B: they know that i'm gonna be getting ready and doing other things after you know the big deal is that feed me and once they've been fed and get outside and run around a little bit and they'll be ready to come back in and they know that you know pretty much what's going on 

208.25 212.11 B: and ah so they just kind of lay around and then 

212.73 216.00 B: you know either they'll come and tell me they wanna go outside or else i'll 

216.01 227.92 B: have something to do and i'll want 'em to go out and i'll tell 'em come on let's go out and they'll go back outside and then i i've gone out there sometimes ah left 'em out there for a couple of hours and ah i'd walk out on the back porch 

227.89 231.31 B: and they'd both be in their house asleep they wouldn't even wake up 

231.76 236.20 B: you know ah if they were awake they didn't even [mn] you know look to see that i was there so 

235.74 237.45 A: yeah 

236.35 242.00 B: they're kind of comfortable i think that means that they're they feel secure and they're comfortable and all that kind of stuff 

242.94 244.91 B: how long have you had your turtles 

244.66 245.76 A: (( ah )) 

246.10 247.14 A: (( man )) 

247.50 252.17 A: for about five six years maybe 

250.72 252.88 B: wow that's a long time 

252.52 255.98 A: i think it might be a little longer i can't really remember but 

255.41 256.84 B: yeah 

256.17 258.06 A: yeah 

257.72 262.16 B: [noise] well that a pretty long time i've had turtles before but ah 

262.25 264.81 B: i can't ever remember having them that long 

264.99 272.11 A: yeah i'm surprised they're still living every time i go out there i think that they might be dead or something but they're still living 

266.09 267.36 B: (( i mean you know some )) 

271.72 274.38 B: well turtles live a long time i think 

273.73 275.36 A: yeah they they do 

275.10 277.68 B: naturally i mean you know i think sometimes 

277.72 290.16 B: something happens to 'em you know w- when they're in captivity you know maybe they get some bad water or something like that but i know they say that you know turtles live you know thirty or forty years 

282.91 283.74 A: yeah 

289.73 291.19 A: yeah 

290.79 305.19 B: depends on i guess what kind of turtle but [laughter] [laughter] that i don't know much about 'em but it i i remember reading that some place and and ah when i was fishing one time we caught a great big ah snapping turtle when i was a kid 

293.10 294.03 A: uh-huh 

298.70 299.53 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

305.27 308.98 B: and ah it was like bigger than a dinner plate you know 

308.59 309.46 A: (( th )) 

309.25 310.44 B: (( and ah )) 

309.69 314.85 A: them big tortoises they say they've lived they can live up to a hundred years or something like that 

314.19 316.48 B: yeah well they might well do it you know 

316.17 317.94 A: yeah 

318.28 321.45 B: but i don't know how you tell how old they were yeah 

320.86 322.86 A: yeah i don't know either 

323.45 325.25 A: (( something like that )) 

325.09 331.14 B: did you find 'em at ah at a pet store or did you did you find them outside somewhere or how'd you get 'em 

330.18 331.11 A: (( ah )) 

330.93 340.19 A: we had one for a lot longer than the other one we bought that one at a pet store and the other one someone was giving it way with the aquarium so 

340.01 348.82 A: we went to their house and we took it 'cause we had a female at first and then they had the male so we wanted to see what would happen so we got the male 

349.35 354.95 A: and so that's how we got the aquarium and i don't know where they got their turtle from 

354.54 363.17 B: yeah well that was a pretty good deal got a house for both of 'em and and a companion they act like they they like having a s- another turtle with 'em 

358.33 359.35 A: yeah 

362.83 370.30 A: yeah they do one time when i lifted up their shelter they were mating one time it's probably the only time i ever seen 'em do it 

369.71 370.61 B: (( ha )) 

370.65 376.67 A: hm there's never any eggs or any babies or anything so i don't think anything really happened 

376.08 377.67 B: yeah 

377.38 378.39 A: (( so )) 

378.49 380.30 A: but i think they like each other 

379.93 381.10 B: (( yeah )) 

380.36 383.04 A: not at first but now they do 

383.01 389.07 B: yeah well you know i'm i this is the first time i've ever had two dogs at the same time 

388.82 389.58 A: uh-huh 

389.24 393.98 B: and i think it's really they seem to really keep each other company 

394.16 397.68 B: i think that's why they kind of don't bother me unless i 

397.83 398.95 B: you know 

399.61 404.19 B: ah wanna play with 'em or call 'em or something like that or they need something 

404.17 416.77 B: ah that i can provide because ah i think i think they're like companions to each other you know they they don't they don't get lonely when you go off and leave 'em and they have um something to you know something to do 

416.72 418.15 A: (( yeah how old are they )) 

417.19 419.31 B: but i bet the turtles are about the same
