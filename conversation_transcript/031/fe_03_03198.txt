271.83 272.97 B: they're 

273.21 274.27 B: little 

274.37 276.69 B: they're little and 

277.02 278.68 A: like little fur balls 

278.65 281.08 B: they can be um 

280.96 295.30 B: they've got um they're kind of muscular but they're really thin they've got long legs and pointy ears and little teddy bear faces and kind of long noses and little tails that curl up um they're really rare um 

296.11 297.20 B: (( and )) 

297.45 298.62 B: when they're 

298.64 303.07 B: bred for show generally their hair grows out really long 

302.75 303.76 A: mhm 

303.19 315.12 B: but um some of them are born hairless in fact i think one puppy in every litter has to be born hairless or there's something genetically wrong with the whole litter 

306.23 307.02 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

314.86 316.07 A: oh my 

315.43 319.75 B: um but some are hairless and others um 

320.11 334.63 B: have hair and you can do whatever you want with it i've seen their dogs in various states of hairiness some of them are have really long hair some they clip it kind of close and curly and sometimes they just shave them completely so 

334.38 335.77 A: oh wow 

335.40 340.88 B: but the good thing about them is that they they shed very little 

341.00 346.72 B: they they barely shed at all and they're very gentle and 

346.82 351.88 B: they have really weak vocal cords so they don't bark and yap a lot 

351.28 352.54 A: oh wow 

352.03 356.28 B: and they're just they're really good animals to have around the house so 

355.46 357.69 A: they must cost a fortune though [laughter] 

357.72 367.54 B: yes they do but they they've been breeding their own so um they make they make some money off of it and they're just good dogs um 

361.45 363.06 A: oh wow
