197.84 199.79 A: well his sister 

199.09 199.65 B: (( [mn] )) 

199.93 203.32 A: his sister was ah as big again as the mama 

203.64 214.46 A: but now they were you know under a under a pound when they were born a matter of fact it was more like about eight or nine ounces [mn] when they were born ah every one of 'em but they just started their growing sprees 

214.35 222.67 B: do you feel that your ah dogs your peekapoos sort of tend to require more attention than your cats or what's your perspective on that 

222.78 228.48 A: ah actually the cats one of 'em's name is satan that belongs to me 

228.13 229.36 B: [laughter] 

228.56 241.84 A: ah it's a pure black cat and then there's another little striped kitten [mn] that ah my big old tom cat found and [mn] took i mean insisted on us going out ah you know to ah 

236.35 237.31 B: mhm 

241.77 246.80 A: ah see what he'd found and it was a little old bitty scrawny skinny pert little kitten 

246.89 249.58 A: all of her ribs had been busted on one side 

246.98 247.73 B: (( ahah )) 

249.64 250.68 B: mhm 

249.83 255.38 A: and ah we wound up capturing her and nursing her back to health and she just had a baby 

255.45 265.76 A: sh- i think she had more than one but there was only one that i know of survived 'cause she had 'em up in the eaves of the house [lipsmack] ah and for the first time ever she's actually let me come in and pet her 

266.08 267.20 A: (( ah )) 

267.56 272.45 A: your question was ah which is more affectionate the puppies [mn] but 

271.37 281.64 B: you d- what do you do you so they don't they come around a lot more and sort of try and stand there and you you give them a lot more affection 'cause they obviously seem to need it [mn] than the cats do 

275.79 276.71 A: yeah 

281.65 293.13 A: but n- now that wild cat the one that we tamed ah [mn] just since she brought her baby in ah she she's getting where you know she actually will talk at you and want you to love on her 

292.97 302.29 B: mm yeah that's sweet [mn] i used to have i used to have dogs ah i've had dogs off and on and where i'm staying right now we have dogs and it's 

294.81 295.80 A: (( so [mn] )) 

302.08 311.40 B: it's just really i- it's what's real interesting to me is sort of how other dogs feel about watching other dogs get a- get attention um there's a little dog named chelsea who's ah i 

311.52 317.29 B: don't know what style of dog she is she's or breed of dog she's she's a floppy eared dog but um 

317.45 320.07 A: okay that could that could be anything 

317.53 318.77 B: she ah 

318.87 319.69 B: (( she )) 

320.16 325.90 B: yeah [mn] yeah th- unfortunately i'm not too familiar with the breeds of dogs but um 

325.81 338.11 B: she um she is she's she's she was very distant when i first met her very very distant so we're thinking she might have had some sort of history of abuse before she came to live with the family she was living with now 

338.04 347.93 B: but [mn] she was very distant and just as you got you get closer to her you sort you know really showing her affection and being near her she really really warms up to you 

347.83 356.78 B: i mean [mn] in the past she would sort of skim- scamper away when [mn] i came around but now she sort of comes over to me and stuff and she seems to really like to be 

357.24 363.99 B: really like to be you know loved and hel- and held on to i think it's r- i think dogs really tend to really like 

358.60 359.76 A: mhm 

364.15 374.72 B: th- like attention but the other dogs are funny 'cause the other dog named beethoven he's about thirteen years old and is the longest running dog in this family um the family that i'm staying with 

374.77 389.30 B: and he just [mn] whenever he sees another dog getting attention he'll just go nuts [mn] he'll come over and and and in the fir- his first big attack is to try and put his butt into the face of the other dog [laughter] to try to get the attention 

387.65 388.91 A: oh no 

389.81 396.81 A: (( well now my our setter i said he was lab he's an irish setter ah he's ah two hundred pounds )) 

396.52 397.54 B: mhm 

396.97 398.78 A: a._k._c. registered 

398.90 407.30 A: now he won't bother my husband in the mornings but at five o'clock between five and five thirty he comes up and puts his furry head on me 

407.09 408.12 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

407.55 415.24 A: somewhere and if i don't get up he keeps on till he gets up on the bed in me with me and roots me out of bed to take let him out 

416.76 418.68 A: i am dead serious 

418.27 425.12 B: that must not be that must be ah sort of ah that's a that's a sort of interesting v- version of an alarm clock huh 

424.33 430.05 A: yeah well now he he's the best dog i've ever seen in my life he's never once dirtied in the house 

429.66 430.96 B: mhm oh that's 

430.31 437.61 A: the rest of the animals the rest of 'em will have accidents if you don't let 'em out that dog will i mean 

437.74 440.54 A: you can see him crossing his legs
