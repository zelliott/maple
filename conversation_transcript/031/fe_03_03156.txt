80.18 82.23 A: they're supposed to be very loyal too 

82.08 87.56 B: yeah i liked them a lot but um um 

85.69 88.61 A: [noise] i was considering getting a shepherd but uh 

89.11 93.73 A: my wife persuaded me to get a labrador 'cause she thought it would be better with kids but [noise] 

93.17 96.39 B: yeah with kids you're probably better off trying that but 

97.21 111.08 A: yeah this thing uh this [cough] lab we have is is great with the kids when the kids were growing up i mean they used to just lay on her and uh pull her tail pull her ears and she didn't even uh didn't even uh 

111.57 117.09 A: seem to notice i mean she just realized they were kids they're very they're very intelligent dogs 

117.00 120.58 B: you didn't get your dog from a pound or something to do just from a breeder 

120.37 123.08 A: no we got her from a breeder we um 

122.01 122.84 B: yeah 

124.99 135.41 A: i guess in the long run we figured it'd be better we had toyed with the idea of uh breeding it but then i just we realized that it was just was too much work [laughter] 

135.93 137.29 A: so um 

137.49 140.94 A: uh we we got it actually from a breeder on the 

141.32 146.25 A: [noise] eastern shore in maryland i'm located up in northern virginia 

147.33 151.11 A: so uh this guy he'd been breeding uh 

151.82 153.86 A: breeding dogs i don't know for 

153.88 156.43 A: eight ten years and um 

156.80 158.06 A: he uh 

158.39 165.78 A: he there's different types of labradors i don't know if you're aware there's an english and a and a uh canadian and a american 

166.28 174.37 A: and uh some are larger some are smaller and the english field ones are larger i guess and that's the type we have 

174.61 179.59 A: so the female we have weighs a hundred and six pounds 

179.00 181.01 B: oh that's pretty heavy for a lab huh 

180.69 182.79 A: yeah it's big it's uh 

182.91 187.04 A: much [noise] taller than normal than the normal lab that people are used to 

187.91 192.51 B: yeah our shepherd was only about ninety pounds she never even reached a hundred i don't think 

192.17 194.02 A: right was it male male 

193.51 194.72 B: yeah 

194.13 201.24 A: yeah they're uh i mean they have a different size shepherds too i guess uh 

201.96 207.65 A: i even had a friend out in california that was that had two hybrid wolf shepherd 

208.31 213.20 A: dogs pups [laughter] which was pretty funny because uh 

213.47 219.34 A: you know they they re- resembled a wolf more than a shepherd but they were extremely skittish 

220.05 232.13 A: but um then california passed a law outlawing that so that was the end of that personally i don't know anybody who'd waste their time doing that but apparently they were trying to 

224.77 225.63 B: really 

232.51 236.04 A: trying to breed a uh a better um 

236.06 238.87 A: (( watch dog i don't know )) 

240.67 241.48 B: huh 

241.85 243.47 A: but 

241.89 244.12 B: did your dog work as a watchdog too 

244.00 249.30 A: oh yeah it's uh it's very good uh uh their their hearing and their smell is amazing 

249.78 252.95 A: and uh our dog will hear something 

253.34 255.91 A: outside with the windows closed 

256.11 261.67 A: and head for the door and start barking i know he can tell when cars are turning into the drive or 

261.51 262.64 B: yeah 

262.38 267.62 A: you know but um of course once you get in the house it's your best friend for life so 

267.22 279.37 B: [laughter] um one of our cats really can do that one of the cats is really attached to my dad and whenever he'd come home from work uh the cat would get up and walk over to the door to his car sounds but not the other cars it was amazing 

279.13 292.69 A: mm cats are uh i'll tell you they're they're from very intelligent too but i mean they're also very self-centered [laughter] they're really not going to you know when you keel over and die it's just going start looking for the next person to feed it 

285.17 286.92 B: (( yeah [laughter] they are )) 

293.11 301.25 A: they're not real concerned about uh who's who's opening the can of food or opening up the box of of food 

301.34 303.55 A: just so somebody's there 

302.91 304.29 B: (( right [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

304.62 308.18 A: and uh the funny thing is that like with our cat it uh 

308.71 316.54 A: i don't know whether it was mistreated by a male or just uh just doesn't like males 'cause it was a male but uh it 

316.74 326.46 A: wouldn't go near me for about six months and um it was very attached to my youngest daughter even though my oldest daughter got it and uh 

327.27 330.33 A: it would actually wait for her to come home from school 

331.75 335.00 A: but then as it got older and it started on out 

335.18 345.55 A: i was usually the one that let it in and out at night so it started to identify wi- identify me with the with the way to get the door open so you know 

344.21 344.92 B: uh-huh 

345.66 350.05 A: at three o'clock in the morning the thing would jump on my chest and start slapping me on the face 

350.34 356.29 A: to get me up to let it out so i mean they're they're bright enough to figure out who does what [noise] 

352.30 353.36 B: [laughter] 

357.83 358.79 B: right 

358.62 360.65 A: but they're interesting animals 

360.75 364.81 B: yeah we used to let our cats out whenever they wanted to and then i guess 

365.03 370.66 B: about two or three years ago one of them was killed by a fisher in our backyard [noise] and so uh 

368.83 369.55 A: (( mm )) 

370.86 385.32 B: my little brother was really [noise] upset by that [noise] so we stopped letting the cats out at night [noise] and then uh he got a kitten about a year ago and we don't let he doesn't let that one out at all 'cause uh he's just very protective of her now so 

385.67 391.78 A: well you know you you got to get him if you you have to get him uh inoculated they've got uh i 

392.54 400.85 A: mean they've got all sorts of stuff now they've got feline aids that they've got to watch out for and um you know all the other normal stuff 

397.32 398.19 B: right 

399.67 409.29 B: and i figure if you're going to get a cat you might as well let it out you can't really get a pet and expect to put it at the top of the food chain or something when you let it outside you have to 

409.46 412.42 B: accept what happens to it when it goes out on the road [noise] 

409.62 411.28 A: yeah 

412.33 417.16 A: that's why you know my daughter wanted to get the claws removed and i said oh if you 

417.30 428.64 A: get the claws removed you not going to be able to let it out you know since this cat grew up on the street it's not going to stick around the house i mean that's the way it is it goes out uh you know at night and comes back in 

419.67 420.57 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

429.10 433.95 A: and goes out again well it it sits out there and catches you know mice 

434.88 437.72 A: it even catches uh moles 

437.99 445.71 A: and um you know trots back to the uh front step with them and leaves them there for you in [laughter] the morning as a trophy 

446.18 453.95 A: but um they're you know they're really uh they're amazing little hunters but they sure do wreck the uh 

454.91 457.62 A: wildlife in the area that they hunt 

457.54 467.45 B: they do our little kitten that doesn't go outside uh found a way to hunt inside all of a sudden we found in our kitchen we found dead baby garter snakes 

467.22 468.06 A: (( into )) 

467.70 478.03 B: and uh they were just about three or four inches long but somewhere she was digging them up from our basement [laughter] and we never found where they were coming from but uh we got about a half a dozen of them and then it stopped 

477.83 486.92 A: mm [laughter] that's wild yeah they uh you know the bir- you can tell because the birds stop coming round even if you have a feeder the birds stop coming round and uh 

487.17 494.23 A: the squirrels disappear unless uh they're absolutely sure that the cat isn't outside and then you'll see one or two 

494.94 496.34 A: (( but um )) 

496.51 502.34 A: they um they sure do i mean they really control the area that they uh roam around in 

502.20 503.03 B: yeah 

504.49 508.36 A: but uh the dogs you know the dog is just uh 

509.47 511.69 A: you know nothing bothers it 

511.27 512.72 B: [laughter] 

511.77 519.34 A: and it used to really really hate cats uh it couldn't stand them and i got this thing and uh it ignored it at first 

515.32 516.24 B: right 

521.30 529.17 A: uh it just snarled a couple of times the cat went over to uh scratch it on the on the the muzzle 

529.17 539.29 A: and then it was the only time i ever saw it snap at the cat and now they're like best friends and they go out together and wander around and come back in together it's really strange 

537.36 538.33 B: (( [laughter] )) 

540.20 541.32 B: that's great 

540.23 541.31 A: and uh 

541.40 543.48 A: yeah you know it's uh 

543.86 547.51 A: better than having them trying to kill each other the whole time but [sigh] 

548.39 554.09 A: problem is when you have larger dogs like that and they get up to be around nine that's where they start showing their age 

554.34 555.63 B: yeah 

555.84 557.24 A: (( yeah and um )) 

557.96 568.62 A: i know that uh i've been trying to persuade my wife to get another puppy because i know that my daughters one's thirt- two youngest daughter's one's thirteen and one's uh 

568.77 579.50 A: just turned sixteen and if uh the dog unfor- you know unfortunately passes away in the next couple of years they're going to be devastated so 

578.53 580.63 B: would you get the same kind of dog 

580.73 584.50 A: yeah i think i would um they're uh 

581.49 582.41 B: yeah 

585.20 588.40 A: they're just uh they're just good companion dogs i mean 

588.98 595.10 A: i take mine down to uh you know a lot of parks with a lot of lakes around here i'll take mine down to the 

595.67 599.89 A: park and i'll just you know the thing will just dive in the water and have a great time
