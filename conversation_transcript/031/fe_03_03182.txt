24.58 25.74 B: (( yeah exactly )) 

26.25 27.33 B: (( do you have a pet )) 

27.21 29.89 A: yeah i've got a dog 

30.81 32.55 A: her name is [noise] gracie 

33.10 44.76 A: she was uh rescued from the pound i'm not sure what she is i think she's mostly hungarian vizsla she's kind of a yellow dog with yellow eyes weighs about fifty five pounds 

45.23 47.11 B: yeah how big is it how tall 

46.86 50.66 A: uh she's probably 

51.04 54.21 A: maybe twenty two twenty four inches at the shoulders 

55.19 57.35 A: she's a decent sized dog 

55.54 56.46 B: about 

57.12 58.25 B: yeah 

59.07 62.56 B: (( so how much time do you spend taking care of her and stuff and )) 

61.92 69.21 A: um as as little as i can actually i do a lot of travelling so i never really wanted a pet 

69.55 75.68 A: and uh she kind of was a an un- unwanted gift uh 

75.58 90.06 A: interesting story we i went out to eat with a at lunch time with a fellow i was working with and we were have you ever seen in the restaurants where they'll take these pound dogs and cats and put these little colored photos that says please rescue me they're going to incinerate me 

89.86 91.36 A: you know on the walls 

91.37 92.59 B: (( yeah i've seen them )) 

92.23 98.87 A: yeah well she was one of those and there was this big picture of her hanging on the wall we're on out way out of this restaurant and this guy said 

98.87 108.45 A: said to me he says you like that dog and i looked up at it and she had beautiful yellow eyes i said yes she's got pretty eyes and i kept walking and that was it all i said was she's got pretty eyes 

108.47 122.58 A: next day i come into work and he says well i got your dog i said you did what i said i got your dog i said what dog he had to remind me about this photo i said i don't want no dog i says i can't take care of a dog i'm not home enough 

122.76 124.99 A: and uh he says 

125.58 130.29 A: i already paid for getting her spayed and everything so i thought oh 

130.29 140.97 A: man he's already dumped a hundred and seventy five dollars into rescuing this jo- dog and getting her sterilized and so i've got a dog [laughter] 

139.98 144.14 B: (( that's yeah interesting story the other guy makes a great salesman [laughter] )) 

143.49 150.25 A: yeah yeah i named her gracie because i figured it'd take the grace of god to keep her alive living with me 

150.40 150.99 B: (( yeah )) 

151.01 153.46 B: so do you regret having a dog is it too much for you 

153.59 158.34 A: um no not really she you know she isn't she's not a 

158.47 163.49 A: not a not one of these lappy type dogs she's fairly independent and i think she's uh 

163.70 171.36 A: you know because she was a stray dog at the beginning of her life she's always had a bit of a rebellious independent spirit in her 

171.30 186.03 A: and um so she isn't really that much trouble to take care of a few pats and a good feed once or twice a day and she's okay but when i leave town my parents have to come over and feed her that's the only part that i don't like about it is 

186.03 191.20 A: you know the responsibility you lay on other folks when you can't take care of your animal 

191.06 191.94 B: yeah 

192.12 193.81 B: yeah my parents' dog 

193.87 194.85 B: um 

195.42 198.81 B: (( my mom likes spoiling the thing to death so the thing always bugs me )) 

199.20 201.04 B: it's one of those things where they uh 

199.40 200.26 A: what 

201.60 209.58 B: give it whatever it wants you know it's like you start to relax and then the thing goes nuts 'cause no one the world is not revolving around it so 

203.04 204.18 A: oh 

209.19 215.23 A: they're not one of these people that take it to the drive through at the fast food and buy it a hamburger are they 

215.01 219.84 B: uh not usually it's too small it's too picky about that it doesn't like uh fast food burgers so 

218.21 219.16 A: yeah 

219.59 222.31 A: oh man what kind of dog is it 

222.81 224.60 B: it's a lhasa apso 

224.31 225.41 A: okay 

225.33 227.68 B: real small one it's like a mop 

226.40 228.17 A: yeah 

228.05 228.91 B: but 

229.56 230.88 B: it's a nice dog and 

229.69 231.45 A: spoiled sick huh 

231.60 234.87 B: yeah it doesn't like people lik- it's like if it meets a new person 

234.99 242.26 B: uh he'll he'll try to smell you and everything but then if you try to touch him he goes nuts and you know it's just not good [laughter] 

241.83 242.91 A: wow 

243.56 244.40 B: but 

243.70 245.89 A: strange dog 

246.55 249.88 A: i thought those dogs were more affectionate than that 

246.73 247.41 B: yeah 

250.01 255.29 B: uh i guess i guess some- something about littler dogs are that they're sometimes all right and it's just the way he is 

255.59 264.73 B: i don't know 'cause i think every big dog i meet is is real nice and you know low maintenance you don't have to do a whole lot with it just feed it once a day and call it good but 

265.20 267.25 B: the littler dogs seem to be 

267.61 271.90 B: more picky about things and then they tend to be meaner i guess which is 

268.99 269.80 A: uh 

272.15 274.71 B: different than i would have originally expected when uh 

273.90 275.73 A: ye- yeah 

275.36 277.33 B: before we got dogs though 

276.75 281.42 A: yeah it's true have you ever seen these little chihuahuas chihua- they run out and bite people 

281.20 283.15 B: (( yeah yeah kinda vicious )) 

282.06 285.53 A: the last dog in the world you'd expect to get bit by 

285.70 289.65 B: yeah a cute thing what's this dog it's a cute dog what's its name oh it's killer 

289.29 291.59 A: yeah yeah 

291.35 292.12 B: so 

292.74 303.19 A: yeah i don't i don't know gracie um i think gracie's probably more mutt than she is anything but i i kind of think that the pure bred lines get inbred too much 

303.52 305.77 A: and uh you get n- n- 

305.65 319.00 A: you get personality quirks and you get medical problems that they're prone to and you get a nice mutt and they've got all the right genes mixed back in to 'em from the canine gene pool and i think they tend to be uh 

319.25 324.28 A: a little uh m- more able to survive planet earth than those 

324.39 329.75 A: hybrid poodles and different animals that people love 

330.15 335.43 B: yeah i know with my uh the lhasa that my parents' have that he's he's a pure bred and uh 

336.12 341.37 B: actually i guess the purebreds are known to have back problems and neck problems and stuff so they gotta take 

340.32 341.18 A: (( they )) 

341.68 351.19 B: extra time and extra money to try to fix his problems and just you're talking about you're talking about a lot of money you've got to spend on because 

341.70 342.52 A: they 

344.12 345.15 A: yeah 

349.49 350.69 A: i know 

351.20 352.28 A: i know 

351.22 355.77 B: i mean surgery for a dog you know insurance for a dog usually 

354.96 356.25 A: forget it 

356.64 359.80 B: (( insurance you're talking a couple of thousand dollars per grand )) 

360.04 361.09 A: forget 

360.07 365.08 B: whereas that kind of money just doesn't even if you had a lot of money i wouldn't want to put a couple of thousand dollars into a 

364.61 365.85 A: for real 

365.51 366.82 B: a little dog 

366.36 370.53 A: i know people get attached to those things 

371.08 374.79 A: but that's what i'm saying you know the pure bred dogs they get these uh 

375.05 380.98 A: they're inbred too much and they have all these physical problems like your back and neck problems you're talking about there 

380.36 381.12 B: yeah 

381.14 382.37 B: yeah 

381.61 387.74 A: that's why a good old mutt i think is probably the most maintenance free dog there is 

388.03 390.27 B: plus they don't cost anything to get 'em 

390.16 395.83 A: true except for nowadays you know at least locally uh where i live here they 

396.30 406.58 A: will not let you rescue an animal from the government pound unless you within thirty days prove that it has been neutered 

407.34 408.22 B: right 

407.41 416.89 A: which which you know when they passed that law you know i talked to the guy at the dogcatcher place and he said well ever since they passed that law nobody wants a dog we're 

417.02 419.41 A: cremating them all you know so 

420.03 423.86 A: i don't know if that's what they wanted or not but that's what they're getting 

423.97 433.91 B: yeah well my ex girlfriend's uh family they were thinking about getting a dog at at one time from the pound or something like that and so they had to go through this whole big spiel about 

433.95 442.39 B: uh getting to draw up the application and making sure you had a suitable family life and you know get references from your neighbors and stuff and it was just like 

440.66 442.94 A: you're kidding me [noise] 

442.55 447.03 B: i'm like man you're not you're not adopting a kid here this is a frigging dog 

446.46 447.69 A: i know 

448.00 454.08 A: i know i think that they think sometimes the animal rights people go a little bit overboard you know 

454.78 457.60 A: like save the whales kill the babies 

458.52 459.49 B: yeah 

461.02 461.71 B: (( right )) 

463.30 469.68 A: so did you uh did your parents get this dog after you left the house or was he there 

468.26 469.30 B: no i had it 

469.45 471.55 B: i had it when i was living there for about 

471.65 475.66 B: uh must have been like six years or so it was quite a while 

474.49 477.36 A: [noise] oh okay well he's pretty much your dog then 

477.50 478.50 B: yeah 

479.82 481.64 A: part of the family 

480.16 480.93 B: so 

482.34 484.34 B: yeah in some ways yeah 

484.40 490.67 B: he's getting old though he's getting all kind of quirky and he sleeps a lot now so 

491.06 496.46 B: i think my my mom really wants to get another dog once he's gone and my dad's like you know no more puppies [laughter] 

495.94 499.91 A: yeah yeah uh what was your name again 

499.94 500.81 B: jim 

500.58 514.73 A: jim if if we suddenly do get cut off there's a really bad electrical storm headed this way and it's starting to rain so i will if this cordless goes out i've got a hand held here i'll grab hopefully that'll 

514.75 518.39 A: maybe i'll just switch right now let me pick this other phone up here 

518.41 519.58 A: you still there 

519.72 520.54 B: yeah 

520.17 522.80 A: okay let me kill this cordless [noise] and [noise] 

523.00 524.08 A: we'll uh 

524.35 528.97 A: that way i won't if the electric goes out [noise] i won't have to deal with that [sigh] 

529.75 531.40 A: lose the signal 

530.09 530.87 B: (( okay )) 

531.42 536.99 B: yeah right something else about taking care of dogs uh when i was at my parents' house i was watching t._v. 

537.02 538.07 B: (( uh um )) 

538.52 542.08 B: (( anyway i saw this little like i think it was a dog )) 

542.66 543.74 B: (( i don't know )) 

543.97 548.72 B: like a hotel almost y- you rent this little room for your dog and 

548.05 549.41 A: seriously 

548.78 551.35 B: then they have it's a little probably 

551.37 558.70 B: eight foot by eight foot square and they'll have a couch and they'll they even had t._v.s in there and the whole deal for 'em 

557.74 559.22 A: that's ridiculous 

559.22 560.97 B: an- and you got to pay like 

561.55 565.93 B: i think it was like fifty dollars a night or something like that to keep your dog here and i 

566.00 568.34 B: was just like man [laughter] 

567.94 569.26 A: that's a joke 

570.47 573.56 A: man who in the world would do that 

573.26 579.38 B: yeah i don't know well i wouldn't i mean well maybe if you don't have anywhere else to put the dog maybe put him 

579.50 587.29 B: you know somewhere where they can keep him like you know in a cage for a while but i wouldn't buy him a frigging hotel room that's for sure 

586.88 588.12 A: really 

587.87 588.63 B: (( so )) 

589.26 590.37 A: man 

591.70 593.29 B: it's the luxury life 

593.52 599.89 A: yeah i don't know i i think that's another example of people going overboard treating dogs better
