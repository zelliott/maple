155.25 157.22 B: and they eat little goldfish 

157.43 163.24 A: so you you buy little goldfish and you just stick 'em in and they live three seconds and then they get devoured [mn] 

162.74 171.93 B: well i have a second tank where i keep the goldfish and every once in a while they get a little treat from the little tank to the big tank and i feed them little pellets and everything 

165.37 166.19 A: (( ahah )) 

167.42 168.68 A: [laughter] 

171.07 171.91 A: (( ahah )) 

172.67 179.51 B: i mean i think they're a lot of fun but later on i want to get a saltwater tank with coral reefs and stuff 

173.95 175.93 A: that is fun yeah 

179.46 184.36 A: saltwater ah fish are very colorful i used to like my friend had one 

184.36 190.60 B: yeah i have friends that have it but they're really time consuming and expensive that's the only drawback for me 

184.51 185.43 A: (( and i [mn] )) 

189.24 193.50 A: yeah you have to regulate the temperature right and it's harder to um 

193.09 199.89 B: there's more main- yeah there's a lot more maintenance but i think it's a lot it looks a lot better 

193.86 195.46 A: care for them right 

196.85 197.84 A: yeah 

200.19 201.86 A: yeah they're pretty 

201.47 206.49 B: yeah i would much rather have a saltwater tank but you know time and maintenance 

207.66 220.55 A: yeah that's the problem i i work and i don't have time to be home to pl- to have an animal [mn] maybe i ought to think about getting a fish tank or a bird or or something although i- i'm a real dog lover type guy so 

221.08 227.61 A: i i i'd rather have a dog but it's just not fair to the animal to leave it all alone during the day [mn] 

226.34 231.69 B: yeah because most of them need someone around 

230.84 241.07 A: oh yeah they're like little children and ah they they take a lot of your time and ah [mn] but when you come in that door after work boy i remember get such a greeting [laughter] 

241.05 243.81 B: i never had one but i have friends that have dogs 

244.11 245.22 A: yeah you just 

244.42 249.67 B: and they're always a lot of fun but after a while you know they want to go play and you really don't want to 

249.74 262.28 A: well w- i used to have a big back yard and i'd just open the back door and run around with her outside i didn't have to take her for a walk too often that was a special treat 'cause she'd run away she'd slip out of the leash 

261.84 263.39 B: (( we )) 

262.57 270.86 A: and cross a busy road and i used to be chasing her with my heart in my mouth just worried about her that she was going to get hit with a car 

271.56 272.47 A: so 

271.74 273.91 B: live in a apartment so 

274.99 281.98 B: there really isn't that much space in an apartment yeah but fish are perfect they sit there 

275.03 275.94 A: (( ah yeah that m- )) 

276.31 279.06 A: that makes it tough yeah 

281.80 285.08 A: yeah so do you have how many fish altogether 

285.50 287.78 B: i have two big ones 

287.37 289.04 A: how big is big 

289.26 292.18 B: about i guess they're about 

293.40 303.26 B: three inches tall about four four and a half inches wide i have two of those and then i have a bunch of little goldfish i buy those every week 

297.10 299.13 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

303.57 304.97 A: oh that's cool 

305.16 309.21 A: and does it relax you to just sit and watch them with the lights turned down 

309.42 315.08 B: yeah they they swim around i put rocks and fake plants in there and they swim all around there and 

312.71 313.66 A: (( ahah )) 

315.39 319.63 A: [mn] one time i i had the tank and i put in a real plant 

317.61 321.67 B: (( everything )) 

319.73 321.55 A: [mn] and it was a big mistake 

321.62 328.50 A: because it had some kind of eggs on it and the next thing you knew happened the whole tank was loaded with um 

321.70 322.74 B: yeah 

328.72 330.06 A: snails 

330.74 332.47 B: really 

331.29 336.44 A: it grew snails and somehow i guess snails don't need another snail to reproduce 

336.58 337.78 A: and the whole 

336.82 341.41 B: yeah i heard that i was told not to put live plants in there 

340.51 344.69 A: yeah i i would not because it algae and the 

344.18 348.09 B: unless you have an outside fish tank like those japanese 

348.14 349.54 B: garden things 

348.83 350.08 A: yeah 

350.26 354.77 B: and those require a lot of maintenance right there the 

353.50 356.49 A: do your fish ever get that disease called the ick 

356.76 357.83 B: (( ick )) 

357.42 360.79 A: yeah it's like these white spots they get on their fins 

360.54 366.19 B: yeah i had ah i had one fish that had that i didn't know what it was and i had to put him out 

363.63 365.26 A: yeah 

365.36 370.10 A: i had that ah my fish were getting sick all the time 

370.17 374.55 A: with that ah used to put in these drops in the in the water 

372.30 372.98 B: i 

373.42 380.79 B: yeah there's some special chemical you can put in there and it fixes 'em it takes a little while but they get better after in the long run 

377.17 378.11 A: yeah 

380.34 382.47 A: yeah and did your fish have names 

383.00 385.58 B: ah yeah one was called bluey the 

385.30 386.60 A: (( [laughter] )) 

386.25 388.30 B: other one is called maximus 

388.11 389.25 A: maximus 

388.49 391.92 B: sort of sort of like gladiator 

391.13 392.50 A: oh cool 

392.37 395.55 B: the other one is bluey and he was blue so you know he 

394.54 397.90 A: yeah that fits i i never gave my fish names 

399.38 401.90 A: i guess i wasn't too attached to them 

402.09 405.96 A: i used to get mad when the big fish used to attack the smaller ones 

406.42 409.84 A: and i'd stick stick my hand in there to like scare 'em away 

409.67 411.68 B: he was oscars 

410.13 411.22 A: and one time 

411.68 415.76 A: no the kissing gourami used to like you know makes that pucker face 

411.78 412.69 B: (( ah )) 

415.58 417.82 B: yeah 

415.89 419.36 A: and it used to suck on the other fishes' scales 

419.69 423.70 A: so one time i was just a teenager i stuck my hand in there to scare it 

423.72 428.54 A: and i grabbed it and the next thing i knew it was like swi- swishing back and forth 

428.48 443.20 A: and all the scales accidentally fell off the fish 'cause i i guess i didn't know that was going to happen [laughter] and then like the next day the poor thing was you know floating on the top i killed it by accident and then i was upset yeah 

440.57 441.93 B: oh that's 

443.16 447.15 B: see with my oscars my two big fish they need a lot of space 

447.27 448.85 A: yeah 'cause they're big 

447.61 448.74 B: i 

448.83 454.75 B: yeah i i mean i have a seventy five gallon tank and still they've like outgrown it 

450.12 451.75 A: but you have a big tank 

452.42 453.41 A: mhm 

454.77 456.33 A: [mn] what shapes 

455.38 460.95 B: i wish i had other fish that are smaller you know i had a whole bunch of 'em you know like when you get a red lobster 

460.52 461.94 A: mhm 

461.57 464.60 B: like that i think that would be a lot more fun but you know 

464.30 470.59 A: what shape is your tank is it square rectangular or is it one of those cylinder types 

467.97 468.96 B: (( it's ah )) 

470.32 472.35 B: it's a rectangle 

471.69 473.06 A: mhm 

472.63 476.83 B: i want to get one of those cylinder ones those are very nice or a corner one 

477.60 480.59 A: yeah those are those are nice decorative for the house 

480.39 482.67 B: yeah i think they look really nice 

480.97 486.10 A: yeah now you got me thinking that i want a pet again [laughter] 

485.17 487.96 B: i mean fish are fun and 

486.12 488.98 A: fish are perfect yeah 

488.16 498.90 B: i yeah i mean you ha- you do have take care of 'em but you can take care of 'em at different times like at night when you come back home or early in the morning i mean i'll 

494.35 495.69 A: mhm 

497.94 502.99 A: what what are some of the things you have to do i'm trying to remember i know you feed them once a day 

503.06 505.44 B: you feed them 

503.13 505.20 A: and do you have to change the water 

505.46 508.68 B: ah every once a while you have to cycle the water out 

508.38 509.70 A: how often 

508.77 509.69 B: (( and it )) 

509.98 511.10 B: (( ah it )) 

511.12 513.79 B: it really depends on how much algae there are 

514.90 527.44 B: sometimes if you keep your blinds closed in the room where you keep the fish tank you can go like six months without changing it but if it's open light produce- helps produce algae or something promotes it 

523.17 524.14 A: mhm 

526.55 527.88 A: yeah 

527.50 532.49 B: so then you have to change like every week also you need to scrub the tank 

529.52 530.59 A: oh boy 

532.54 533.81 A: right 

533.28 538.08 B: the inside and the chemicals once you get everything started up 

534.15 535.09 A: yeah 

538.51 540.78 B: really maintenance is not that much 

542.39 548.44 B: though with my ah two big fish they eat the smaller ones so that's like the recurring cost every week 

548.27 551.72 A: do you like watching them gobble them up [laughter] 

550.73 552.52 B: yeah it's actually a lot of fun 

551.97 555.93 A: after you put them in how long do they live before they're gobbled up 

555.95 562.10 B: it depends on how hungry they are usually i'll put in like at first i'll put four in 

557.85 558.81 A: mhm 

562.40 569.74 B: and two are gone just like that then they'll play a little for like a few seconds and then two more are gone after that 

564.31 565.29 A: wow 

568.58 571.95 A: [mn] now do they eat ah regular fish food as well 

571.61 583.68 B: yeah they eat little pellets that are specially made for 'em like nutrients i usually give this to them in the morning and then when i come back in the evening or afternoon they get the real fish 

574.24 575.12 A: (( ahah )) 

584.06 585.60 A: oh you give 'em a treat 

585.43 590.82 B: yeah so they have like lunch or breakfast and dinner basically 

590.24 592.50 A: [laughter] cool 

592.58 595.75 B: and then whenever people come over they like to see the feeding 

595.54 599.89 A: yeah i'd like to see that that'd be kind of morbid but it's interesting to just
