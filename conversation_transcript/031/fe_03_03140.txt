74.90 75.82 B: yeah

96.73 100.89 A: and she she's kind of a farm dog she kind of does her own thing 

101.51 113.34 A: but she's around and i think she's other people's dog too i think the neighbors kind of think that she's a [laughter] like uh if they come home and she likes to run over there and hang out on their porch and uh 

106.78 107.86 B: [laughter] 

113.47 116.36 A: pretend that she's been there waiting for them to come home 

116.21 117.46 B: that's fine 

117.22 122.72 A: yeah but i think we're also not the only people that feed her i think that has something to do with it [laughter] 

121.19 122.59 B: gotcha yeah 

123.07 123.80 A: (( so they're )) 

125.48 128.85 B: yeah we have two strays that hang out on our back porch 

128.89 132.64 B: and they yeah two stray cats and they do the same thing i think 

128.97 130.38 A: (( cats [cough] )) 

132.65 134.04 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

133.01 136.66 B: they disappear for two days and they're both getting real fat [laughter] 

134.38 134.94 A: (( [noise] )) 

136.34 137.96 A: right [laughter] 

137.14 137.73 B: (( [mn] )) 

138.27 140.17 A: (( yeah the cats our cats )) 

140.61 144.80 A: we got intentionally but i don't know how much they stick around or not they 

144.96 156.38 A: they were given to us by a lady who i don't know they she was really really really into her pets like kind of crazy they came with this whole entire litter that had um 

156.56 157.76 A: (( all of their )) 

158.90 159.48 A: (( [cough] )) 

159.57 168.56 A: all of their behavioral characteristics and uh their names and why they had their names and what they liked to play and oh it's kind of crazy [laughter] 

167.99 168.95 B: wow 

168.78 177.12 A: yeah but it's really interesting because the letter it turns out that these two cats' personalities are completely opposite of what 

176.99 185.31 A: she'd indicated so i don't know if that's the difference in us or the difference in how she perceived her cats and what they really were or what but 

177.20 177.96 B: huh 

184.31 185.69 B: right 

186.02 192.37 A: they're kind of cool though every once in a while i look out in the woods behind our house and i'll see one way up in a tree 

192.40 197.76 A: just kind of hanging out in there so [laughter] so much for cats getting stuck in a tree i don't know if that's a 

197.88 199.39 A: myth or not 

199.12 201.17 B: huh i wonder how she gets down 

201.33 209.74 A: i i don't know but she comes back so [laughter] somehow or another she gets down probably our dog chased her up there [laughter] 

203.80 205.08 B: [laughter] 

208.05 209.36 B: [laughter] 

210.84 212.14 A: (( but [cough] )) 

212.16 214.87 A: and we actually also have two goats right now 

215.38 217.57 A: which are expecting babies 

217.27 218.60 B: (( oh really )) 

218.29 225.63 A: yeah it's kind of interesting we've got a small pygmy goat which itself looks like a small like about the size of a baby goat 

225.74 226.84 A: and uh 

226.97 239.31 A: i'm not sure i'm kind of interested in seeing what these pu- these baby goats can't be much bigger than a puppy i'm not sure i'm fascinated to see what how how small these little goats are going to be 

238.12 239.14 B: right 

240.03 242.37 B: swell i've never heard of a pygmy goat 

242.83 254.62 A: yeah i have one supposedly a neighbor of ours got three at an auction for like six bucks for all of them and then he couldn't keep 'em in a fence so he got rid of them and we bought one to keep our other goat company 

254.42 255.39 B: (( gotcha )) 

254.76 264.20 A: and uh she um won't stay in the fence for us either so we tried to give her to somebody else who took her and couldn't keep her in the fence he brought her back 

263.08 265.43 B: [laughter] 

265.92 268.69 A: so we're kind of stuck with her for a while 

269.51 272.29 B: i'll have to remember that next time i want to buy a goat 

272.15 275.05 A: right don't buy a little one [laughter] 

273.77 275.08 B: [laughter] 

275.06 282.28 A: i think it would be okay but for some reason she is just not afraid of the electric fence like even if it shocks her she'll just go right through it's worth it to her 

281.96 283.30 B: right 

282.84 286.43 A: and she knows it's going to shock her so she just jumps through 

286.28 288.12 B: (( gotcha huh )) 

288.37 290.95 A: whereas the other one's more timid she'll 

291.06 294.87 A: she'll kinda nose up to the fence but she knows it's going to happen she'll back off 

296.00 296.88 B: right 

297.18 298.69 A: (( so [laughter] )) 

300.07 301.93 A: (( that's how it is um [noise] )) 

302.67 304.77 A: (( hold on a second i'll call you in a minute )) 

304.78 306.02 A: sorry [laughter] 

305.49 306.53 B: that's okay 

306.79 311.75 B: yeah we got um my the one cat that we have i actually got when i was in college 

311.57 312.40 A: uh-huh 

312.11 314.95 B: my roommate and i got it we lived in the fraternity house 

315.72 316.72 A: (( oh yeah )) 

316.18 320.84 B: yeah and we actually tried to go to the pound and get it and the pound wouldn't give us a cat 

320.55 326.90 A: yeah the pound is kind of expensive too i think we tried to get a cat from the pound once it cost like sixty dollars 

326.28 328.89 B: yeah that's what we wound up paying at the pet store 

329.18 332.99 A: did you like just like a mall pet store getting a kitten 

329.72 330.80 B: yeah 

331.65 332.51 B: yeah 

332.75 339.23 B: because the the the pound said you know they couldn't guarantee the you know the environment of the cat and all that [laughter] and 

338.72 339.96 A: right 

339.27 341.75 B: (( i was like what did they think we were going to do with the thing )) 

341.37 355.55 A: [laughter] yeah i think you have to fill out this don't you have to fill out this whole questionnaire that says like what like what um how much time you are going to spend with your cat and what kind of environment you are going to provide for it and i think there is this whole big thing 

353.62 358.38 B: i'm sure they didn't even let us get to that point though we just called in and they were like ah no 

355.67 356.71 A: [laughter] 

358.53 362.11 A: right [laughter] sorry 'cause you were in a fraternity house 

358.87 359.69 B: sorry 

361.46 363.21 B: yeah 

362.55 364.13 A: (( oh well [laughter] )) 

364.69 369.07 A: i think every cat i've had up until these two i've found in alleyways 

369.59 373.95 B: yeah we have a lot of strays uh i live in uh jersey city outside of new york 

373.90 375.14 A: (( oh yeah )) 

374.37 376.70 B: we have strays all over the place 

376.67 378.24 A: yeah i'll bet you do 

379.53 386.24 A: no we have lots of strays but they i don't know they don't really come around here they just you know they're just wild cats a lot of the time 

385.82 387.10 B: right 

386.97 391.99 A: but man their our neighbors are on that cycle of reproduction where 

392.37 403.65 A: you know they get a kitten and that kitten gets pregnant and then those kittens get pregnant and i don't know how many cats they have around there but every time i go over there there's another little kitten just as pregnant as she can be 

402.05 406.42 B: [laughter] got to get those things fixed at some point 

405.95 413.70 A: right [laughter] when you get to the point where you have sixty cats and they all need fixed what are you going to do [laughter] [laughter] 

410.64 412.90 B: right yeah 

413.18 416.93 B: get cheaper to get the than take in all of that 

415.33 416.59 A: yeah 

416.79 417.69 A: yeah 

418.05 429.39 A: we had that happen once we had a cat have a bunch of kittens and then we got rid of those and then she had a second set of kittens really great we've got to we've got to do something so there we were at the pound getting her fixed 

429.00 429.93 B: right 

430.34 436.05 A: and our dog we tried to have puppies we wanted her to have puppies and she had ten of them 

436.72 438.07 A: and uh 

439.21 443.50 A: there we weren't expecting that many i mean all in one batch she had ten 

442.63 443.48 B: right 

443.65 447.06 A: and so we got that fixed she we got her fixed too 

447.33 449.30 B: ten is a ton that's a lot isn't it 

449.04 451.47 A: yeah i never heard of that many before 

451.80 452.78 A: but 

452.84 454.22 A: (( i'll explain later )) 

454.42 462.29 A: i'm sorry [laughter] sorry my husband's asking who i'm talking to and i can't even remember your name it's vance right okay [laughter]

467.27 470.28 B: yeah yeah just checking it out 

468.17 472.88 A: okay i thought it was really strange and i thought well okay i'll kind of check it out 

472.94 485.50 A: my father in law was a linguist major in college and i have to admit that it piqued my interest a little [laughter] although i'm not even sure what the point is i'd like to call that number and ask more questions about it 

479.02 480.12 B: gotcha 

484.41 487.67 B: right what they're looking out what they're looking here i don't know 

486.93 491.55 A: right right kind of makes you conscious of what you're saying huh [laughter] 

491.00 495.22 B: yeah it does i'm sure that's why they have you talk about such generic 

495.27 502.00 A: subjects such as what we do with our pets [laughter] how i think that's i think we're allowed to vary like 

495.93 498.44 B: yeah i think they are just right 

502.01 504.61 A: dive off topic a little aren't we 

504.01 505.26 B: i would think so 

505.22 506.09 A: (( all right )) 

506.56 507.73 B: um 

508.35 511.65 B: i'm trying to think if i have anything else interesting 

511.49 513.88 A: do you spend a lot of your time with your pets 

514.21 517.12 B: i do actually um i'll be 

517.21 520.14 B: 'cause i've been i'd never i've never was a cat person 

520.01 520.92 A: right 

520.50 525.32 B: and then we got this cat and so i'm oddly attached to this to the little guy 

525.11 527.66 A: that's kind of cool not as much with your dog 

526.03 526.91 B: yeah 

528.18 532.00 B: no the dog i am too but uh the dog has sort of 

532.12 534.25 B: adopted my roommate 

533.84 539.37 A: yeah our dog is like that actually my husband and i had just met 

534.43 535.75 B: and uh 

539.37 551.66 A: and i went and picked up i was like i'm going to pick up this dog and he's like okay i'll go with you and we got up there and the dog just adopted him and that was it it was his dog not mine so it was a good thing he stuck around [laughter] 

546.74 547.66 B: right 

549.78 551.93 B: [laughter] 

551.68 555.01 A: otherwise the dog would have been pretty unhappy [laughter] 

553.92 556.31 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

555.97 562.27 A: although we don't really spend time with any of our animals [noise] animals they seem to have their own life kind of 

563.51 567.56 B: yeah i guess if they have that much room it's a it's a it's very different 

567.38 568.25 A: yeah 

567.80 569.61 B: (( like they can go out and stuff )) 

569.93 570.62 A: (( yes )) 

570.33 576.42 B: like i we have a little backyard where the my cat can't kinda wanders around but there's really not a whole lot of 

577.13 578.38 B: you know she does- she 

577.51 579.45 A: you let your cats go outside 

579.42 581.43 B: yeah just right in the back 

580.15 581.52 A: and they don't run away 

581.53 586.18 B: yeah no she's not smart enough i don't think [laughter] 

584.82 588.26 A: [laughter] that's probably good 

586.81 588.64 B: (( she's not real bright so )) 

589.81 592.96 A: (( yes you can go out in your jammies sorry [laughter] )) 

594.11 595.34 A: (( okay go outside ))
