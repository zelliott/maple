54.39 58.50 A: and i think everybody needs a pet [laughter] 

58.16 60.81 B: yeah i do agree they're really 

61.07 64.01 B: they're go- great company and um 

64.93 70.06 B: kind of always there and always excited to see you and that kind of stuff 

70.54 73.46 A: yeah how how old is your little girl 

70.76 71.58 B: now 

73.48 75.54 B: my little girl's two years old 

75.13 75.97 A: two 

75.86 83.90 B: yes so i she would love to have a pet so i said when she's old enough to take care of a pet and help me with it then we'll get a pet 

83.97 86.05 A: yeah 

84.13 91.76 B: so we probably will get a fish which is a pet but i think more of like dogs and cats and those kind of things 

91.85 95.34 A: yeah my daughter just had to have her 

95.42 97.65 A: dog put to sleep 

97.05 98.43 B: oh no 

97.76 102.78 A: and my grandson kept asking for the dog 

102.77 104.52 B: (( oh no )) 

103.07 106.29 A: and so she kept having to say that 

106.40 111.40 A: he had to be put down because they don't say put to sleep it's put down 

108.38 109.44 B: yeah 

110.04 111.68 B: right 

111.61 114.88 A: um and then we went up and visit 

115.30 121.11 A: and i just got my puppy and he was in seventh heaven with my puppy he's two 

119.52 122.09 B: oh i bet and how old 

121.13 122.21 A: and 

123.00 124.19 A: (( a half )) 

123.89 126.48 B: okay well that's how old my daughter is so 

126.12 133.48 A: yeah he's two and a half and he thought having the puppy there was the greatest thing there was 

132.73 134.75 B: [laughter] i bet he did 

134.77 143.54 B: my daughter we have friends that have a little dog and and she's asked me every day i want go hold chip i want to go hold chip and i keep telling her we need to call him 

143.68 146.59 B: and so you can go up there and hold chip so 

146.39 147.50 A: (( mm [laughter] )) 

146.78 148.11 B: she um 

148.28 161.24 B: she loves being around him and then if they get real barky then she gets kind of scared and she keeps saying they won't get me they won't get me because i've told her that enough times [laughter] that it's like she has to reinforce it to herself 

157.73 159.08 A: mhm 

161.24 162.29 A: yeah 

161.65 162.51 B: (( so )) 

162.50 170.26 A: yeah well my grandson's used to a bigger dog than what my mine is um because mine's a small one 

165.91 166.88 B: uh-huh 

170.00 171.21 B: yeah 

170.90 175.50 A: and um but mine was more his size [laughter] 

174.91 176.25 B: yes 

175.97 177.75 A: um because 

177.76 181.43 A: he could i mean run and jump up on and 

181.81 184.46 A: my pup just loves kids 

184.40 187.07 B: does she is it a she or a he 

185.17 186.22 A: yeah 

186.54 187.82 A: it's a she 

187.33 188.46 B: a she 

188.22 190.89 A: it's a she um 

191.06 192.54 A: and she just 

192.76 196.89 A: when we got her we were told that she liked kids but 

196.95 203.03 A: you know you get told things at the pound and you never know is it true or not 

199.58 200.74 B: right 

202.32 203.63 B: right 

203.30 206.18 A: and to me it was very important 

206.54 211.51 A: that she did like kids because if a dog doesn't like kids 

208.53 209.57 B: yes 

211.67 213.39 A: the dog isn't for me 

213.18 214.29 B: yes 

214.20 218.11 A: and um but she 

218.28 221.01 A: she did she was right at home 

220.69 222.46 B: well good 

222.22 227.87 A: and i think it's very important you know for children to have 

228.15 229.48 A: have pets 

229.79 231.65 A: (( and )) 

229.89 230.80 B: we were 

231.52 245.55 B: we were having a conversation at work because i work with people that a lot of people that have lots and lots of pets and are real strong on it and one of them was saying that her nephews never grew up with pets and so that's something that's not in they 

245.57 254.59 B: don't really care if they have one or not but um she was like i can't imagine not having pets 'cause we al- have always had them and so 

254.84 257.00 B: i guess the difference is in 

257.80 265.85 B: i guess if you've been exposed to 'em when you're young you think a lot more maybe understand the importance of pets and that kind of stuff 

264.34 265.59 A: yeah 

265.67 268.49 A: yeah i couldn't imagine not having 

269.02 280.29 A: having a pet um as a kid we always had dogs and cats and um i had a shetland when i was a kid 

279.91 280.88 B: uh-huh 

280.59 283.69 A: um and my kids grew up with 

283.85 285.90 A: (( dogs cats pigs )) 

286.18 289.58 A: (( horses um fowls )) 

286.35 287.59 B: wow 

289.46 292.80 B: you guys must live out like on a farm or something then 

292.06 294.45 A: yeah we lived out in the country 

293.94 295.11 B: okay 

294.96 303.26 A: um and you know my my kids knew that the cows and the pigs were to raise and eat 

303.13 305.64 B: yeah so that was never a problem 

305.34 307.92 A: no that was never a problem 

307.95 310.52 A: they knew that's what that was for 

310.36 311.34 B: uh-huh 

310.80 315.20 A: that that was food and and the same thing with the chickens 

315.04 316.04 B: uh-huh 

315.78 320.67 A: and but they knew it was their responsibility to go out and feed 

320.89 322.91 A: and collect eggs too 

322.69 323.79 B: yeah 

323.62 328.29 A: and um you know some people think that's cruel 

328.68 331.15 A: but how did our ancestors do it 

330.87 332.13 B: right 

331.97 335.69 A: you know i come from an okey family anyway so 

335.13 337.46 B: oh do you that's where i'm from too 

337.32 343.09 A: and so you know i mean for me that's like second nature [laughter] 

341.57 344.58 B: right right 

343.46 344.72 A: um 

344.73 348.59 A: and so yeah i couldn't imagine not having an animal as a kid 

348.43 349.61 B: yes 

349.26 352.41 A: um and like i said it's a good learning 

352.92 359.20 A: but i agree with you your daughter you know until she's a little bit older and she can help out 

358.62 364.60 B: right and particularly i'm a single mom so it seems like i'm busy enough as it is 

359.46 360.39 A: you know 

364.41 365.85 A: oh yeah 

364.70 373.01 B: and um and then i don't have any family where i live now so that's my other thing was just having somebody that could watch 

373.12 377.12 B: the animal while we're you know if we go out of town and that kind of stuff 

376.53 379.01 A: mhm where do you live at now 

377.22 378.05 B: (( so )) 

378.93 384.61 B: i live right outside of dallas texas right now and my parents live in oklahoma 

381.24 382.47 A: (( oh okay )) 

384.32 385.44 A: okay 

385.71 389.68 A: um yeah i think we were supposed to say where we lived at i don't know if did or not 

388.39 390.91 B: oh okay i missed that or not 

390.57 394.61 A: i don't know if we was or not but i think somebody said we was 

394.16 395.21 B: okay 

394.67 396.57 A: i live in arizona 

396.22 397.54 B: (( oh okay )) 

397.20 399.95 A: and that's where we live at now 

399.21 400.36 B: okay 

400.05 413.23 A: and um that's one reason why i wanted a dog again because i miss my kids and my grandchildren and so the dog has to take the place of my children and grandchildren [laughter] 

406.72 408.05 B: (( yeah )) 

412.06 414.13 B: right right 

413.80 417.08 A: i left them in california and my son 

417.16 419.49 A: and his wife's in new mexico 

419.14 427.80 B: oh wow so you are yours are spread out yeah we're kind of the same way i have one brother and he lives in washington state so we're kind of spread out too 

425.50 426.62 A: mhm 

427.62 429.05 A: yeah 

428.11 429.43 B: (( yeah but um )) 

429.67 433.59 A: but i know what it's like being a single mother because i was for 

433.98 435.18 A: a while 

434.90 436.66 B: yeah 

435.32 439.29 A: and um until my kids were they was 

439.97 441.53 A: ten and eleven 

441.54 442.52 B: uh-huh 

441.54 444.72 A: until they was out of high school before i got remarried 

444.28 445.51 B: wow 

445.25 447.76 A: and um 

448.20 450.70 A: so but when she's about five 

450.88 452.10 B: yeah 

451.88 453.78 A: would be a good age for her 

453.22 458.97 B: i had considered i've heard that guinea pigs are really good pets for small children 

458.77 459.87 A: mhm 

459.14 462.27 B: that they don't require a lot of care and they seem 

462.67 467.00 B: to like you know they like to be handled and that kind of stuff so i have considered 

465.03 465.94 A: yeah 

467.10 475.19 B: um a guinea pig and seeing i've got some friends that that have one so i'm going to check with them and kind of see how much care 

475.24 483.75 A: you know i used to i would have said before yes until my daughter in law got bit by a hamster 

475.33 477.44 B: they require and that 

483.61 485.12 B: oh really 

484.39 486.00 A: and it almost killed her 

485.90 487.38 B: really 

486.78 492.37 A: yeah and hamsters and guinea pigs are not supposed to carry diseases 

487.86 489.30 B: wow 

491.67 492.88 B: yes 

492.43 500.43 A: and this one got a disease that normally it gets from rabbits and um ticks 

494.24 495.77 B: really 

497.45 498.54 B: uh-huh 

500.38 501.82 B: wow 

501.00 502.74 A: and it almost killed her 

502.67 504.11 B: wow 

503.51 509.52 A: i mean if we ever get black plague she won't be she'll be she's immune to it now 

506.46 507.60 B: yeah 

509.58 510.79 B: wow 

509.61 511.55 A: because of all the medication 

511.31 512.42 B: uh-huh 

511.99 515.59 A: um but my kids had a hamster growing up 

515.57 516.64 B: yeah 

516.32 520.84 A: um and you know my nephew had guinea pigs 

520.73 522.04 B: yeah 

521.57 525.77 A: so yeah i've always been for them before but now i'm 

525.40 527.68 B: yeah that would make me nervous 

526.73 530.68 A: [laughter] i i'm kind of against them now [laughter] 

529.12 536.86 B: yeah because i'm like you we had a hamster growing up we had pretty much we had dogs but we did have a well we had some turtles and a hamster 

537.02 539.16 A: you know cats are easy 

539.90 541.02 B: cats 

540.69 543.19 A: (( yeah cats are easy )) 

542.34 544.92 B: yes they are they um 

545.07 552.48 B: and i have thought about that i've always like dogs more than i've liked cats but i have considered that because they 

549.48 550.44 A: me too 

552.31 565.61 B: they're easy to leave you know you can and so that is something i have thought about um i think the only thing i dislike i guess i have in my mind having and i'm not sure why we always grew up without outside animals 

553.74 554.77 A: mhm 

557.35 558.21 A: yeah 

564.95 566.15 A: mhm 

565.47 573.36 B: but i guess i think about having inside animals and i'm not sure if they shed i don't know i hear people say there's hair everywhere and 

572.78 576.66 A: yeah well cats do shed um 

576.70 580.01 A: now see my dog's an inside outside dog 

579.61 582.64 B: okay yeah that's probably what ours would be too 

582.22 586.83 A: you know but that's how come i got a small dog a lap terrier does not get big 

586.62 587.84 B: yes 

587.50 590.58 A: they don't get big at all um 

590.64 597.39 A: and cats i mean they shed but if you keep 'em clean and you comb 'em a lot 

596.71 597.90 B: uh-huh 

597.48 599.89 A: i have friends who have cats and
