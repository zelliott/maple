109.02 111.80 B: and they do they count as pets or no

119.03 120.02 B: oh 

120.14 133.29 A: which is kind of a shame but um the pets think they're you know that's okay we were a- a- asked how much time do we spend with our pets i don't know i mean i spend time every day not as much as i'd like 'cause i'm a mom 

131.80 143.94 B: i don't spend as much time as i like i i ah i work out of like if i'm home she's with me constantly she's literally like a small dog she will sit with me the whole time but 

144.01 148.36 B: [cough] sometimes they days like two or three days go by where i can't see her 

148.26 160.22 B: 'cause ah i stay in manhattan if i'm if i'm working really late i stay in manhattan with my boyfriend so then two or three days will go by and i'll come home and she'll be all sulky and upset and 

159.62 161.45 A: (( mhm mhm mm ))

180.43 190.34 B: on human zanex so now we have a prescription for human zanex for his cat and we crush it up and put it in her food and she's becoming more docile very slowly [laughter] 

180.67 181.44 A: [laughter] 

189.73 196.68 A: (( oh good i mean at least it's helping but yeah isn't it odd [laughter] putting a cat cat on medication )) 

193.71 207.53 B: it's so odd i feel i feel bad because like it was my fault 'cause i should've like picked a cat for him that he really loved not like you know walked up to him and played with him and stuff but i was like no i want this cat you know and 

207.35 209.22 A: 'cause it reminded you of yours 

208.76 214.07 B: yeah exactly and that was the whole purpose of having a cat in the apartment [laughter] 

213.82 219.48 A: yeah well would you consider getting another cat for a friend for your one or 

217.46 218.27 B: no 

218.61 224.74 B: no no no i can't i live with my mother she will slaughter me if i get another pet she didn't want this cat 

219.69 220.40 A: oh 

221.50 222.61 A: (( oh )) 

224.85 227.16 B: she did not want this cat 

226.66 229.03 A: (( oh okay okay [noise] [laughter] )) 

227.32 233.79 B: [mn] so i mean if i bought another pet she'd kill me and i'm lucky she hasn't thrown my cat out into the street yet 

233.58 240.88 A: well does she it sounds like she should love your cat 'cause your cat's such a great animal [noise] i mean is she in love with him or 

239.04 239.90 B: well 

240.78 241.71 B: what 

241.66 244.31 A: is she in love with your cat does she love your cat 

242.96 248.17 B: no she can't stand the cat she hates the cat yeah she just doesn't like cats you know

253.37 262.52 B: she's not like one of those weird people that doesn't like cats for some reason she just doesn't like my cat 'cause my cat's obese it's really fat 

262.29 263.32 A: mhm 

262.44 270.25 B: and so anytime it sees anyone eating or sees anyone in the kitchen it cries and cries and cries and cries 

270.28 272.82 B: so it drives her a little bit crazy
