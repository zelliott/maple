124.89 131.87 B: they are i mean like you said they're a member of the family and um i was brought up with always having a pet so 

131.94 135.87 B: i've always regarded them as you know a close member of the family and 

136.53 137.47 B: um 

137.58 139.73 B: treat 'em as such so 

140.05 145.96 B: i think it's important to have uh children and i think it's important that they grow up with animals as well 

145.91 149.23 A: absolutely i grew up with uh animals um 

149.26 152.73 A: i grew up with dogs and my brothers had rabbits 

153.09 160.89 A: but um i remember even my nieces um they were so accustomed to 

161.13 164.85 A: (( um being out and about with the dogs uh )) 

164.30 165.26 B: right 

164.94 171.47 A: the dogs are just children and dogs pets are my you know i mean 

171.61 173.56 A: just best friends around 

173.54 175.24 B: (( right i )) 

175.19 179.40 A: uh yeah someone um asked me the other day to um 

179.95 184.02 A: to keep uh one and i'm seriously considering it 

185.43 186.64 B: yeah 

186.01 188.83 A: because it's it's a great opportunity 

188.56 189.74 B: yeah 

189.91 192.42 B: so are you going to get another dog 

192.62 197.90 A: i i want to i want to get an- another pet because um 

198.12 201.34 A: you know like just it makes your life so much richer 

201.25 203.14 B: it does i agree 

202.71 209.61 A: yeah dogs are it's it's if this was uh more of a coincidence that both of us love dogs 

203.26 204.29 B: it does 

210.42 211.59 B: yeah 

211.85 215.58 A: you know a lot of people um have not been so exposed 

215.55 216.58 B: right 

215.97 221.57 A: and um they've become uh they show a level of hostility 

221.61 222.64 B: right 

221.78 224.59 A: towards pets and especially dogs 

225.09 231.71 A: um and i just you wish that you know a level of education 

231.73 235.06 A: uh would be there for people 

235.24 237.82 A: to just understand better 

237.98 251.15 B: right i think it has something to do with your upbringing too 'cause my husband they grew up with dogs that were outside dogs that were not really regarded as much of a pet 

238.07 239.52 A: um you know 

250.93 252.15 A: (( yeah )) 

251.59 258.39 B: um and he has a different relationship he you know he he likes animals but he doesn't have the same attachment 

258.06 259.08 A: right 

258.54 259.39 B: um 

259.69 272.38 B: you know he could he thinks they're fine to survive outside in any type of condition and you know that type of thing and i'm more you know we have the dogs in the bed with us and everything else so 

272.50 273.44 B: um 

273.92 276.93 B: you know i think it has a lot to do with how you were brought up too 

276.70 278.89 A: yes uh because um 

279.75 287.22 A: (( wh- i i i was brought in a um very closely knitted family environment )) 

287.44 288.52 B: mhm 

288.22 289.90 A: (( and um )) 

290.37 293.62 A: we housebroke our dogs and we 

293.65 297.23 A: you know paid a lot of attention to them [noise] 

297.05 298.06 B: right 

297.76 306.67 A: and that i have passed on to um you know my sons and my uh my nieces and so because um 

307.70 310.34 A: i just see it as being 

310.37 315.34 A: very very important you know [noise] in terms of displaying love 

315.18 316.26 B: right 

316.03 322.52 A: yeah if you can't take care of you know um children 

323.77 326.99 A: uh if you can't take care of pets how can you you know [mn] 

326.58 334.32 B: right that's what yeah when we first got married that was the first thing we did is we got a dog [laughter] before we had children and 

330.89 331.87 A: (( yes [noise] )) 

334.37 337.61 B: it does teach you uh responsibility and um 

337.92 343.02 B: you know having somebody or or something depend on you so 

342.21 343.30 A: (( yes [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

343.63 344.56 B: um 

345.22 348.17 B: but yeah like you said it does enrich your life and 

348.37 349.30 B: um 

349.86 353.32 B: it's it's well worth the the responsibility 

354.48 355.95 B: to care for them 

355.81 359.50 A: (( right wh- why why do you think um )) 

359.81 365.08 A: you know a lot more uh households are wi- are not with pets 

366.01 373.82 B: i think probably either financial or just the responsibility of you know if you travel a lot and 

373.85 386.12 B: um that type of thing um my father travels a lot but he has um he has his house set up to where he has a dog flap so that and he has a fenced in backyard of course and the dogs can come and go 

386.11 395.60 B: um so if he if if he has to travel for two or three days at a time he has a self feeder and that type of thing but you know he still feels a little bit guilty for 

395.66 396.78 B: for uh 

397.28 405.89 B: not being there as often as he'd like to be but um and he has two huge afghans they're probably ninety pounds they're 

406.01 410.10 B: probably considered overweight for an afghan but um 

410.66 411.62 B: um 

412.68 417.03 B: uh you know that's a that's an expense in itself just feeding them but 

417.17 423.08 B: um i you know i guess that's part of the reason some people just uh you know have a fear of animals or 

423.76 424.71 B: or 

424.90 427.13 B: you know just don't care for 'em 

426.90 430.13 A: but you know dogs are your best friends once you 

430.47 437.96 A: once the dogs understand that you care for them even if you if the dog know 

434.56 435.43 B: right 

438.09 441.84 A: they forgive you in in a m- matter of minutes 

441.65 443.80 B: i agree yeah i agree 

442.69 444.09 A: (( yeah you know )) 

444.12 448.90 A: they're [laughter] they're [laughter] they're so they're so loyal yes 

448.81 451.15 B: right unconditional love 

451.38 455.98 B: yeah you can come home and have the worst day in the world and they you know they still come up and 

456.04 457.45 A: (( [noise] absolutely pe- )) 

456.05 459.99 B: are happy to see you and yeah it's um 

460.10 464.68 A: pets are just uh just um it's just amazing to have them around [mn] 

464.57 472.06 B: right and i think that's uh more specific to dogs i mean i i've never had a cat before but i think that they're a little more 

472.16 475.97 B: detached than than a dog would be i don't think that they're 

476.45 481.14 B: i don't know i don't know i never been much of a cat person i don't have anything against them 

480.16 484.37 A: well there the both of us i mean i concur with you because 

484.46 487.12 A: i have the same the same feeling 

486.75 488.03 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

487.14 490.52 A: a dog is you know the pet for me 

490.35 491.41 B: right 

491.36 492.16 A: (( you know )) 

491.87 497.51 B: i mean we even have fish but you know we got the fish more as a responsibility for my son 

492.52 493.76 A: not the cat 

497.65 502.41 B: to you know learn to feed and i mean they were nice to watch and stuff but 

502.51 506.65 B: i don't think they get too excited [laughter] when they see you 

506.78 513.47 B: although uh i guess if you have a can of fish food in your hand they might [laughter] perk up a little bit but 

513.57 516.86 B: yeah i think there's something unique about dogs so 

518.11 522.30 B: yeah i'll definitely always have have a dog
