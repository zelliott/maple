116.66 120.98 A: really did you ever consider um pet insurance 

121.05 128.58 B: well once she got it and stuff it was too late for me to get insurance on her yeah because she'd had so many problems and 

124.39 125.65 A: (( too late huh )) 

127.99 129.13 A: mhm 

128.71 130.30 B: so now we're using 

130.44 135.57 B: herbs and natural things and seeing if that is well 

132.26 134.64 A: oh yeah and is that working 

135.72 141.53 B: i noticed lately she's sleeping a little more so i'm wondering if she's finally getting relief you know 

141.20 142.83 A: oh yeah 

141.74 146.93 B: and she's so lovey she loves to get up on your lap and she'll put her head under your

149.35 150.38 A: (( really ))

156.84 158.21 A: really eh 

157.59 161.13 B: yeah and she weighs twelve pounds now so it's like 

160.84 162.02 A: oh 

161.35 165.35 B: but she's still a big cat and then the other one is a long haired 

165.20 166.51 A: mhm 

165.88 171.43 B: little one and my my da- it's got my daughter written all over it because

178.52 179.70 A: (( oh that's nice )) 

181.63 182.53 A: uh-huh 

182.71 187.42 A: patches oh i see and do they um hunt at all do they bring little presents 

186.53 191.48 B: um patches does she brings us mice to show us she did a good deed 

188.11 189.00 A: yeah 

191.00 196.83 A: yeah that's what they say that they they give it to you as a present right kind of like um 

191.93 193.08 B: (( and [laughter] )) 

196.85 197.83 B: oh yeah 

197.78 199.06 A: to the owners 

199.53 202.95 B: oh yeah they they bring 'em to show that they they're doing their 

203.05 204.19 A: their job 

203.26 207.72 B: their beat outside and they're taking care of us so we don't get the mice and 

206.84 218.97 A: yeah we have a lot of moles so that she used to bring those and then um one time she was on my balcony and she um caught a bird from the balcony she brought it inside 

209.51 210.90 B: oh yeah 

219.80 233.18 A: so you know yeah it can be nice their names were jack and jill because they were brother and sister [laughter] [laughter] my um she was two and a half my daughter when we got them and that's what she named them so that's what they were jack and jill 

223.67 226.60 B: [laughter] jack and jill that's cute [laughter] 

233.43 236.21 A: and then ah we've had some fish 

236.23 238.22 A: as well but um 

238.39 241.22 A: i guess we overfed them [laughter] 

240.45 242.52 B: oh that that happens too 

242.26 250.47 A: yeah you think you're doing you know you have to make sure you're you're feeding them and then um i think they ate too much but 

250.40 252.62 B: that happens [laughter] 

251.26 255.81 A: it's nice it's nice to have we were thinking of maybe getting a dog sometime 

256.21 258.75 A: but ah it's a lot of work 

258.44 259.78 B: yeah and 

259.05 260.02 A: you know 

260.15 262.64 B: my son would really like to have one but 

262.58 263.49 A: yeah 

262.65 268.96 B: you know if we want to travel or something that makes it really hard where cats you can set it up and 

267.78 269.67 A: plus the walking you know 

269.53 270.79 B: (( yeah )) 

270.12 272.24 A: the walking them every day and 

271.70 273.02 B: (( yep )) 

272.26 277.67 A: my um my neighbor has um a yellow lab his name is scooby 

277.81 288.12 A: and he's adorable he has these beautiful eyes and you know they're just very good dogs but he's already had brain surgery and a problem with his hip 

288.03 295.38 A: so i think they spent about seven thousand dollars on the on the you know the surgery on the care for the dog 

291.57 293.24 B: (( [laughter] scooby wow wow )) 

295.82 299.49 A: so i guess if we ever do it we will probably get insurance [laughter] 

299.71 301.51 B: yeah because the 

300.44 301.87 A: just to make sure 

301.76 310.72 B: only way they can probably make lacy a little bit better is um if i would have her sinuses opened up and that's like a fifteen hundred dollar surgery 

310.37 311.72 A: oh wow 

311.27 316.36 B: and i just to me i just can't take those chances and 

316.21 318.86 A: no it it's a lot yeah it is 

316.39 317.24 B: (( so )) 

318.23 322.05 B: i'm trying that herbal and the natural things and see 

321.79 323.20 A: well if you're seeing 

322.58 325.64 B: they work on us so why shouldn't they work on her 

323.56 324.81 A: (( exactly )) 

325.12 333.10 A: oh yeah no i think if you've seen her um you know better and sleeping better and more relieved then they must be working right 

330.95 331.93 B: yeah 

332.71 346.28 B: yep that's how that's what i'm thinking she's one of the she's a dark calico she's really pretty and then i have a light calico with well patches is white and with the black and the tan as the marks 

335.18 336.55 A: yeah 

337.69 338.54 A: oh 

341.88 342.85 A: mhm 

342.87 343.81 A: mhm 

345.10 345.97 A: oh 

346.40 356.56 A: yeah yeah no my daughter really wants a puppy but she's six and you know she's just starting to learn how to take a shower [laughter] so i think once 

356.34 364.11 A: you know maybe she's a little bit older and she can look after a puppy maybe we'll you know do something but 

364.06 373.25 A: it's hard to get a commitment from them and then they might agree but then you know when it comes to doing it then um 

373.14 385.29 A: it's hard especially here because it rains a lot i don't know where you're from and if it's how the weather is it must be a little bit um difficult outside with cold and you still have to take the dog out right 

381.14 383.49 B: and oh yeah 

385.03 387.55 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

385.76 389.98 A: or do something right and here in the vancouver it rains a lot 

389.92 401.80 A: so you know i'm i'm more of um a i don't know i'd much rather be inside [laughter] than being outside walking the dog so it does take a a lot of um effort you know there's a lady that 

394.87 396.45 B: (( yeah )) 

400.93 408.42 B: it's a lot easier to just open the door and let the cat in when it's raining outside or snowing or [laughter] 

404.49 406.56 A: exactly yeah 

406.55 410.19 A: and our backyard is not even fenced 

410.19 415.07 A: so we would have to you know fence the backyard or build the kennel or 

414.94 426.69 A: you know like there's a lot of things to do not just go and buy a puppy right but you know what ah my husband did he he went along to the um i don't know how you call it in the states it was the s. p. c. a. 

426.86 428.23 A: do you know what it is 

427.92 429.11 B: (( mm )) 

428.38 431.39 A: it's where you take um like if you 

431.40 434.20 A: ah want to give your pet up for adoption here 

433.01 436.32 B: oh you mean society is what it's called here 

435.68 439.14 A: i guess here it's called it's called s._p._c._a. 

439.16 442.72 A: so you can go there and volunteer to walk a dog 

443.02 445.49 A: so you just take the dog for a walk 

445.47 447.92 A: and they they come out with this um 

447.85 462.68 A: kind of like a vest that says s._p._c._a. a blue vest the dogs and then um you just take the dog for a walk and come back and you know the dog is is feeling better and they need that exercise and it's um for her 

462.65 466.15 A: it gives her um the chance to interact with the dog 

466.28 468.48 A: without having the commitment right 

468.40 469.21 B: right 

469.01 470.54 A: so that's something 

469.59 471.56 B: and that's probably good too 

471.29 472.80 A: yeah i think 

472.00 485.32 B: and they have like here a four h. program and because we live kind of in rodeo land so we're like horses and stuff like that and my daughter wouldn't mind doing horses or bunnies or 

478.61 479.75 A: oh yeah 

482.12 482.93 A: oh 

485.34 487.16 B: with the four h. so 

485.38 486.31 A: (( really )) 

487.01 488.06 A: oh 

488.22 491.68 B: so but right now i'm thinking there's three cats who are just 

492.16 493.71 B: fine [laughter] 

492.70 494.26 A: just enough huh 

494.32 498.18 A: yeah i know my neighbor has a little can- canary 

498.17 499.17 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

498.53 511.54 A: and um i think my cat went into into her house once and she was ready to charge the poor bird you know like they really are um they follow their instincts right 

511.38 517.29 A: so if you want to have a dog i mean a cat and a bird i don't know chances are 

517.61 527.95 A: i don't know depending i guess on the aggressiveness of the cat right or the instinct but she was ready to go and you know just bring it home [laughter] i think 

527.19 529.83 B: (( yeah )) 

528.02 530.61 A: yeah here's another present for you mom 

530.72 532.38 B: yeah [laughter] 

531.25 538.79 A: but yeah i know it's interesting um you know to see and it's important for the kids also to grow up with um animals i think 

538.37 540.17 B: (( yeah )) 

539.01 541.50 A: it it's nice to have that 

540.80 544.65 B: they interact and they get to know responsibility and 

543.91 545.41 A: yeah 

544.77 545.72 B: and um 

545.90 555.14 B: you know they can love i i know sometimes i can be so depressed and you know just pick up my cat and love it and hug it and it makes you feel better mhm 

549.61 550.70 A: mhm 

552.12 553.12 A: yeah 

554.58 556.49 A: i know they are loveable 

556.40 563.63 A: i have a my neighbor ah has a little cat um and when she goes away she asks us to um go feed him and 

563.44 576.74 A: you know just make sure that um the litter box is clean and all that so i take the girls with me and they think it's such a nice you know ah thing to do for the cat and we'll sing to him and just 

576.70 584.34 A: you know it it's um it's difficult when they're alone but if it's just for a few days you know it it's um they're pretty independent too 

584.21 585.29 B: mhm 

584.55 590.39 A: usually the cats more than a dog i think a dog by itself it wouldn't be um 

590.73 599.89 A: um as wise that's probably you know why ah it's harder probably if you want to travel to have a dog because they're not as they really miss you
