127.36 128.22 A: uh-huh 

127.93 130.76 B: and so that's the reason i got a cat 

129.88 132.00 A: yeah it's more feasible for you 

131.60 136.34 B: mhm and i never i mean i never thought i'd get attached to her as much as i have

145.11 146.14 B: she 

147.81 157.30 B: it's funny she's very loyal to me and she's very like loving with me but with other people she's very snooty and she's very like

166.42 168.20 B: (( so she um )) 

168.40 176.14 B: she doesn't like other people very much but [laughter] around me she just craves attention that's all she wants is to be petted 

176.21 179.31 B: so it's nice for me though [laughter] 

177.86 182.97 A: oh it is d- do do you have a husband or do you live alone just you and the cat oh well
