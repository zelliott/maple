114.02 115.04 B: uh-huh 

118.23 119.32 B: uh-huh 

119.06 128.90 A: but since i'm not you know i can only say peripherally they would be very important to me and i know that [noise] whatever pets i did own were important to me um how about yourself 

125.79 127.40 B: yeah 

128.26 132.30 B: myself well actually i mean having a pet i mean you form some kind of 

132.32 143.83 B: bond i guess you know yeah so i mean that's what i had with my cat and it was just like really like upsetting when i had to give it up i mean i cried for like a week 

133.97 134.91 A: (( right [noise] )) 

140.96 142.79 A: [laughter] i 

143.39 144.90 A: uh it sounds like it it 

144.37 147.05 B: yeah i mean i miss it so much 

145.41 147.71 A: (( is very traumatic huh [noise] [noise] )) 

147.26 159.31 B: yeah it was in fact it was and you know like recently we were talking about getting one so my dad went like no no no no no i m- i mean my mom's with me but my dad's like no we don't need one and so 

152.71 153.75 A: right 

159.13 160.37 A: (( [noise] [noise] oh [noise] )) 

159.43 166.01 B: yeah [laughter] yeah but yeah a lot of my friends have pets 

162.87 164.27 A: sorry 

165.28 166.44 A: (( how old are you [noise] )) 

166.57 169.25 B: i am sixteen [laughter] 

168.75 173.28 A: sixteen uh so you've got a little while to go before you can completely call the shots kind of huh 

172.65 174.67 B: yeah what about you 

174.42 181.35 A: i'm twenty six and uh so i'm at the point where i can have a uh a pet of my own if i really want to 

175.44 177.46 B: (( wow [laughter] )) 

178.95 181.82 B: yeah i mean would you want a pet 

181.51 192.76 A: well they're hard to to have especially in the city or um in general but especially in the city you you need to have an apartment that's pet friendly that the landlord and the neighbors accept that um 

185.94 188.05 B: mhm oh okay 

191.29 195.43 B: oh yeah if you're in an apartment they're really strict about that 

195.18 201.15 A: yeah but also you know i like i i like my independence a little too much um i'm a little too self centered at this point 

198.35 200.23 B: yeah 

200.66 202.20 B: oh okay 

200.91 210.26 A: where if i want to take off i want to take off i don't want to worry about this pet not only being taken care of but also missing me to the point where maybe it won't eat or something drastic you know 

204.37 205.83 B: yeah 

209.22 211.49 B: yeah exactly 

210.88 221.42 A: so um so i kind of value my independence right now also i know i'm going to outlive one of these pets if i get one you know it's like it's like it's going to terrible loss you know and i know i'm going to outlive it 

212.11 213.03 B: [laughter] 

213.82 215.16 B: yeah 

217.13 219.61 B: oh [laughter] 

219.71 224.28 B: [sigh] yeah that's one thing yeah so 

223.54 226.52 A: maybe that's just uh commitment phobic speaking i don't 

226.18 238.09 B: yeah and i mean it does take a lot responsibility too so that's like one thing so yeah i think dogs are more responsible than cats 'cause cats can actually watch for themselves than dogs 

230.40 231.25 A: (( know )) 

237.84 240.59 A: so you think cats are less responsible than [noise] than 

239.53 243.70 B: yeah they are less responsible that's why i'd prefer to have a cat than a dog [laughter] 

243.15 249.59 A: yeah well yeah i mean you get you get yeah you get different kinds of affection from each of them i guess 

243.92 245.31 B: yeah 

249.39 252.05 B: yeah yeah but 

250.69 252.70 A: yeah so you're more of a cat person 

252.21 255.72 B: i'm more of a cat person yes i am [laughter] what about you 

256.10 263.87 A: you know i would say my personality matched more of a dog just because i'd prefer if i'm going to pour all this love and affection into something that i get 

259.20 260.83 B: (( a dog huh )) 

263.57 264.56 B: uh-huh 

263.67 273.40 A: more of an outward affection you know more of a [sigh] a you know a tongue hanging tail wagging you know wants to cuddle and wrestle kind of dog thing than um 

265.51 267.70 B: yeah 

268.76 271.29 B: [laughter] 

272.35 274.18 B: yeah 

273.62 283.22 A: and i appreciate cats though you know and i think yeah they're cleaner they're you know they're they seem a little wiser you know but they're just a different kind of uh different kind of animal 

275.05 277.31 B: you do yeah that's good 

277.87 279.07 B: yeah 

279.32 281.53 B: yeah yeah i think so too 

281.81 287.52 B: they see- you know doesn't it sound like kind of weird but i think they're more sophisticated i don't know why i mean [laughter] 

287.42 290.38 A: [noise] yeah no i go i go along with that they definitely are 

287.78 291.46 B: i yeah yeah yeah i mean 

290.45 294.47 A: but to the point where they're actually picky like even if you're their owner and you feed them 

294.22 295.46 B: yeah 

294.65 298.02 A: they don't they won't give you the time of day unless they're in the mood sometimes you know 

297.12 298.99 B: exactly 

298.16 299.98 A: they could take some getting used to 

299.64 307.27 B: yeah [laughter] yeah i mean besides cats and dogs there's also like fishes and what else do people own 

301.13 303.15 A: (( you know [laughter] )) 

305.78 308.57 A: yeah no i used to have fish i used to have i've 

308.09 318.00 B: did you have a turtle or anything like my friend a lot of my friends really a lot of my friends used to have turtles so like yeah [laughter] i don't know what's so amazing about turtles but 

309.77 311.78 A: never had a turtle 

312.95 314.06 A: turtles 

315.05 316.41 A: (( any of uh )) 

316.95 319.66 A: it's a trend that passed me by i don't know mhm 

318.71 325.63 B: [laughter] yeah but i don't know i think i used to have a fish i'm not sure [laughter] 

325.99 328.17 B: (( but and then what else )) 

326.12 332.07 A: [noise] um well you know pets are important to me i mean i think that i you know especially if you're 

332.16 339.65 A: single or uh you know or something of that sort i think you need something that you can pour your love into you know and put some affection in 

333.64 336.13 B: (( yeah 'cause single )) 

336.64 339.35 B: yeah yeah 

339.58 341.46 B: you know what in fact 

339.78 346.70 A: but sometimes i can run the risk for a lot of pet owners who become too obsessed with their pets it seems like they've replaced having a significant other with a pet 

345.88 349.95 B: yeah it's hard to replace them after you had one for like ten years 

349.33 350.76 A: well yeah i'd imagine 

349.87 360.62 B: so like recently my neighbor she had a dog for maybe eleven years and then passed away like over in february i think and now i don't know she was really sad and 

352.84 354.48 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

360.43 365.51 B: i don't know her husband was like you know we can always get another and she was like no no no i don't want another one 

364.83 365.91 A: wow 

365.52 369.15 B: i mean she had like this big attachment to it and 

368.53 370.08 A: yeah it sounds like it 

369.09 382.73 B: yeah and and the thing is all of her children they're off to college and so that that was the only thing she had with her you know besides her husband but still yeah yeah so she had this dog attach- yeah it was sad 

375.94 377.16 A: really 

379.16 380.70 A: well that's sad 

381.71 384.77 A: she still has her children though they're just off to college you know 

383.13 388.36 B: yeah yeah but i mean during like the day and stuff you know she's kind of lonely 

387.65 389.06 A: yeah yeah 

388.48 390.22 B: yeah but 

389.25 392.97 A: but hopefully her husband is uh anyway i guess that he's at work huh 

390.50 391.19 B: (( [sigh] )) 

392.91 401.18 B: mm yeah but [laughter] i think the dog meant more to her than him [laughter] i don't know to me it's just silly [laughter] 

394.83 398.64 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

399.40 402.46 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah that can just generally happen )) 

402.16 411.72 B: yeah it was just like i remember like i used to say to myself like if i don't get married i'm planning on living in new york especially in new york and i'll probably end up with like a cat or something huh 

409.84 411.03 A: have you been out here 

411.52 413.06 A: have you been out here 

411.77 414.55 B: no i actually haven't i really want to

551.05 553.89 B: that's true yeah but 

552.90 558.90 A: uh i wouldn't want to take any chances with an animal like that because their instincts could kick in some day you know who knows
