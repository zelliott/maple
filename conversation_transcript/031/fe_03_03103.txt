7.08 8.98 A: my name's sonny 

9.81 11.05 B: (( [mn] um )) 

10.15 12.81 A: ah we're supposed to talk about pets i guess so 

12.65 13.60 B: yep 

13.52 14.74 A: do you have a pet 

14.88 19.43 B: oh yeah i i i have i have a ferret who's a baby 

18.38 19.44 A: (( a parrot )) 

19.46 20.27 B: (( yeah )) 

19.49 21.69 A: oh really what kind of parrot 

21.88 23.05 B: a ferret 

23.04 25.19 A: (( a ferret oh okay )) 

24.16 26.85 B: yeah [mn] so 

25.53 27.82 A: i haven't seen many of those around 

27.89 29.46 B: yeah well ah 

29.48 34.98 B: you know i j- i just got him about six months ago and he's a real handful 

34.91 36.87 A: really is he real hyper 

37.20 38.57 B: [mn] um 

38.75 43.42 B: always wants attention more attention than i want to give him i mean ah you know 

41.78 43.32 A: [laughter] 

43.56 57.74 B: i mean i try to play with him at least you know an hour or two a day and you know he runs around the house he's got a cage at night so he doesn't get into trouble but they're but but ferrets i i mean they say they're smarter than cats and dogs they're into everything 

47.57 48.75 A: right 

50.77 51.61 A: (( ahah )) 

57.43 59.87 A: right 

59.31 62.22 B: [lipsmack] so ah it keeps me very busy do you have any pets 

62.22 73.39 A: ah i have none ah my brother actually has a fish but i don't know if you really can classify that as a a pet pet you know but i have friends who have dogs and they're a lot of responsibility i'd say 

67.06 68.33 B: [laughter] 

73.68 75.05 B: right 

74.71 83.06 A: so i don't but i don't know one day maybe th- that's the only thing i'd think of getting is a dog i don't really like cats and second i'm allergic to 'em so 

82.97 96.97 B: right well that's why why i decided to get a ferret because a dog you have to walk and you have to do all this but a ferret has the personality of a dog in a miniature package i mean you know they grab the ball they play fetch with you they i mean 

84.05 84.84 A: but 

86.34 87.14 A: right 

92.21 93.28 A: right 

97.20 102.10 B: and as i said they're smart as a whip [laughter] plus they 

100.38 103.05 A: yeah yeah i heard they're real smart 

102.37 105.08 B: plus they go in a litterbox like a cat 

104.71 107.29 A: oh really so they're real easy to train 

105.66 106.73 B: (( yeah )) 

107.67 122.21 B: um ah mine's still a baby so he ha- he he's too smart for his own good he'll pretend to go in the litterbox but not actually go [mn] and to get out of the cage and but we- we're working on that 'cause he's still a baby hopefully he'll he'll not 

110.19 111.19 A: right 

114.93 115.72 A: right 

122.35 127.15 B: make accidents in the house like he's doing now [laughter] but i think 

125.46 128.46 A: right what do you what does a ferret eat 

128.38 136.06 B: um they're carnivores so they actually eat i mean i buy ferret food but they can eat cat food i mean any you know 

134.88 135.84 A: oh yes 

136.26 138.86 B: you know meat based food 

138.48 139.55 A: got you 

140.08 141.11 A: that's nice 

140.41 141.54 B: (( but ah )) 

141.55 144.16 B: yeah i love the little guy his name is milo 

144.36 145.25 A: (( ahah )) 

144.45 152.08 B: and ah he was actually a birthday present last year and i've just wanted one for ever especially a ferret i mean i've always had pets i've 

151.89 160.10 B: got a fish tank if you want to consider the fish pets but some of 'em you know out out of the thirty or so i have i've named a few of my favorite fish 

154.56 156.47 A: oh all right 

160.38 162.23 A: oh all right 

161.60 163.15 B: (( but ah and then )) 

163.60 169.87 A: i've always wondered what ah i mean i've seen ferrets but i've never really seen i've never really interacted with one but 

169.34 176.46 B: right [mn] yeah i mean people are afraid that they bite or do this or that i'm actually i'm from new york and they banned ferrets 

170.17 171.71 A: (( they seem like a lot of fun )) 

176.31 178.31 A: oh really so [mn] 

176.68 186.40 B: which is ridiculous because there's a list of animals that are banned for for being pets which is like lions tigers bears and ferrets i mean it's like you know 

186.51 191.93 B: ostriches i mean it's a real ridiculous list i have i have no idea why they passed the law in new york [mn] 

190.17 193.66 A: [laughter] where are you from now 

192.56 193.63 B: but

229.94 239.81 A: my parents weren't really we didn't really have time for 'em my parents were real busy so they never and they weren't going to give me a pet like a dog 'cause that's way too much responsibility for like a young person 

236.94 237.93 B: right 

239.55 240.78 B: yeah i 

239.72 248.56 A: but on- once i get my own place and all that right now i'm just about to graduate from college i'll probably consider getting a dog that's the only thing i'd really consider getting

248.24 249.38 B: (( yeah right )) 

249.22 260.22 A: but i have friends here he has a yorkshire terrier and ah it's a year old but like it it's a handful because you got to take it to the vet get it all its shots neutered and all that

261.10 261.82 A: (( so )) 

262.69 264.42 A: right 

266.31 267.56 A: right 

267.57 271.18 A: you've got to have time to commit to it that's that's the main thing 

271.16 279.82 B: right you know well i mean i mean th- ah i mean pets like dogs and ferrets they require a lot of attention unlike cats cats are more aloof 

279.68 288.70 B: i mean my house has always been a zoo from when i was very little we had hamsters birds cats dogs you know fish i mean

301.94 304.27 B: a german shepherd actually 

304.09 307.71 A: yeah that that's that's one dog i'd consider getting only because they're 

307.74 309.83 A: they're real smart 

309.23 319.79 B: oh yeah i mean and but ah people were intimidated a l- i mean i lived in an apartment building and there was a small hallway and my m- [mn] you

425.38 426.43 B: (( yeah i'm )) 

427.88 428.89 B: i mean 

429.06 433.30 A: that's something i think if i get a dog i think it might be more of a family thing sorta like 

429.10 430.00 B: yeah 

433.50 443.98 A: everyone can take care of it if i if i w- if i get one for myself i'll get one something like my friend has like a yorkshire terrier just small it doesn't bark it d- it's it's real like docile 

433.60 434.77 B: right 

442.41 442.97 B: (( [mn] ))

456.45 458.32 A: yeah they can be a little hyper but 

458.20 466.49 B: and they're a little weird too i mean like the bark the dog's probably barking at inanimate objects and like i don't know they get freaked out by things [laughter] 

459.62 460.66 A: yeah 

465.39 467.26 A: (( really [laughter] )) 

466.55 467.95 B: yeah 

467.42 471.16 A: that's the total opposite of this one i guess they're all different then 'cause this one 

470.51 484.61 B: right oh i'm sure in the end that's the thing about pets i mean d- i mean everybody says ah you know they're not smart and they don't have personalities and i completely disagree with that [mn] i mean i mean i think pets are very intelligent they know what's going on they 

473.83 474.97 A: yeah 

479.48 480.86 A: right right 

484.46 485.65 A: exactly

495.94 499.73 B: whole life and and even ah i mean i i had a cat but it got 

499.69 513.85 B: sick and died on me and i had a best friend and she didn't understand why i was so freaked out about it and then she finally got she's never had pets and she got a rabbit and her rabbit recently got sick and then she was like now i know what now i know what you were going through i'm like i'm t- i mean you get so attached to them 

508.92 510.13 A: (( oh oh )) 

513.78 518.32 B: especially when you have them for for ten years i mean [mn] they become children 

513.95 515.71 A: right 

518.34 520.13 A: right 

520.28 521.17 A: so

539.70 544.17 A: but yeah that's a u- that's a unique kind of pet you know it's not a cat or a dog or a fish 

544.23 546.34 B: (( right well that's the thing he's )) 

544.72 546.81 A: like something different 

546.25 560.91 B: you know he's small enough to be portable and [mn] and i i know friends that have 'em and they get along with dogs and cats too i mean like he i mean they're little and you'd think you know um you know i he's been around like a doberman my friend's got a doberman and i mean 

548.88 549.99 A: right 

552.76 554.26 A: oh really

578.86 581.48 B: figuring out what he did and what he got into 

581.42 595.43 B: moo- i wouldn't spend so much time just playing with him i have to figure out because when he as i say he's locked away during the day but when i'm home like if i'm watching t._v. or eating dinner and he's running around the house [mn] and then you walk into the other room [laughter] 

582.31 583.12 A: (( that's not is )) 

591.02 597.38 A: it hard to find him sometimes [laughter] is it hard to find him sometimes like when you come back from work or whatever
