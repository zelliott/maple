104.79 112.36 A: yeah definitely that's basically the sa- i would like to have a dog too but that's basically the same reason that i got a cat so because 

109.41 110.99 B: right 

111.48 113.93 B: yeah they're they're moody creatures though 

113.86 116.01 A: yeah [laughter] well 

114.94 121.56 B: i've got a i've got one lying on the floor now and the other one's lying up under a shelf under my cocktail table

126.98 132.64 A: in the bathtub for some reason [laughter] um and sometimes like the other day i actually found him 

132.53 146.05 A: on the pole in my closet like where the clothes hang from he was on the pole i don't know how he got up there [laughter] [laughter] and then he was trying to jump from the pole up to like a higher shelf and i was like what are you doing [laughter] 

136.58 137.84 B: oh my gosh 

138.17 139.50 B: [laughter] 

145.17 157.68 B: you know they they go anywhere because i ah i opened the refrigerator one day and went to grab something out and i always talk to him before i go to work i tell him i'm going to work and you know 'cause i i live alone so 

149.87 150.55 A: [mn] 

154.77 156.30 A: [laughter] 

157.23 158.20 A: uh-huh 

157.57 172.50 B: he's kind of my companion and i couldn't find him he always walks me to the door and i had shut him in the refrigerator he had climbed in the refrigerator and i thought he'd be panicked and when i opened the door he was just laying on the bottom shelf next to the celery [laughter] 

159.15 160.05 A: uh-huh 

164.19 166.18 A: (( oh my god )) 

167.32 168.12 A: (( [mn] )) 

171.83 174.89 A: oh my god [laughter] that's so funny 

173.64 176.53 B: so they're they're crazy creatures 

175.93 180.51 A: yeah that's dangerous though too i always get scared 'cause like like 

180.37 185.22 A: you know sometimes he goes like the minute i open the cabinet under the um 

185.01 200.00 A: kitchen sink like where we keep our garbage and stuff and there's all those cleaners and stuff under there he sneaks in and has to go behind and sniff and i'm like okay that's you know cleaning stuff like don't go in there or the other day i actually found him i had a i left a plastic shopping bag on my floor 

187.41 188.77 B: right 

199.90 206.94 A: and [mn] my roommate actually walked in and saw him i was like half asleep so i wouldn't of even like seen this until who knows when 

206.73 220.44 A: but he had is head in like the handle of the shopping bag and was like you know couldn't get out [laughter] so like who knows i i he could of you know he could of hurt himself ah that's what they get for being mischievous i guess [laughter] 

212.15 213.79 B: oh no 

219.40 226.93 B: you know what i used to when these two were kittens i used to go out like to pets mart the pet stores and buy all kinds of toys for them 

226.67 227.65 A: uh-huh 

227.04 232.51 B: and the black one i taught how to fetch there was this little mouse on the end of like a little pole 

229.75 230.35 A: (( [mn] )) 

232.37 233.32 A: uh-huh 

232.53 238.98 B: and i would teach him to fetch and ah my niece just thinks it the funniest thing to see a cat go fetch but ah 

234.40 235.27 A: uh-huh 

236.66 237.42 A: [mn] 

238.25 239.59 A: [laughter] 

238.89 243.96 B: the cheapest toys i they you know half the toys i buy they wouldn't play with 'em 

243.85 253.96 B: and um i found that the neatest little things you can do around the house ah for free they would play with and entertain themselves for hours but the 

244.10 244.66 A: (( [mn] )) 

250.52 251.38 A: uh-huh 

253.21 254.59 A: like what just a 

254.02 257.98 B: well you know i used to take these plastic coffee stirrers 

257.84 258.82 A: uh-huh 

258.15 265.60 B: and ah i'd put those on the floor and they'd go nuts i have a hardwood floor in my den and they would go nuts pushing them around or i'd take ah 

262.67 263.54 A: oh 

265.42 273.61 B: and get cat litter um not cat litter but um catnip and and put in a sock like an old sock and tie it up and they'd just go nuts with them 

268.47 269.32 A: uh-huh 

270.02 270.83 A: (( oh )) 

271.62 272.59 A: uh-huh 

273.50 275.33 A: oh that's a good idea 

274.24 286.66 B: [laughter] you know cheap toys but ah like i said i'd i'd go out and spend all this money at pets mart and try to spoil them a matter of fact i have a basket sitting in the corner of toys that they rarely go over and play with 

281.13 281.76 A: (( [mn] )) 

286.09 296.62 A: huh that's funny that you say that because i've never i the only thing i ever bought had bought my cat was just you know some little mouse with catnip in it and he did go crazy with that [mn] 

295.66 297.36 B: yeah 

296.76 306.15 A: and then i you know i never really would go to the pet store and spend money 'cause i figured you know what it's probably such a waste i'm sure anything else i buy you know like you said he won't play with 

305.99 313.69 A: and then one day i ended up going in and he always he used to scratch on the couch so i saw this like cat teepee that was covered in um 

313.51 324.85 A: carpet and i was like you know what i'm like people always say they buy like scratching posts and stuff and cats don't use them but i was like let me just try this and i was like it will probably be a waste of money but i'll just try it you know and see what happens 

324.62 339.60 A: and he's so good he uses it like he's supposed to he loves it he goes inside it plays in it 'cause it's like you know it's like a little house kind of and and he scratches on it and it has catnip on it too so i think that helps anything with catnip i think it attracts them 

331.65 333.35 B: (( oh wow )) 

338.92 348.07 B: i the one toy that they play with there's a its called a turbo something it's a round piece of plastic and it's got a ball inside of it which they cannot 

345.12 346.05 A: uh-huh 

347.93 357.31 B: i didn't think they could possibly get the ball out but ah they take their paw and push it around it just entrances them for hours well my black one who is the really mischie- 

349.81 350.54 A: (( [mn] )) 

354.15 355.78 A: [laughter] 

357.20 371.42 B: mischievous one and he's sitting there looking at me now he knows i'm talking about him but um he got the ball out somehow so the ball is somewhere in my home [laughter] and i keep thinking you know i need to move the refrigerator the stove out because i know it's under there 

360.65 362.24 A: [laughter] 

366.38 367.17 A: (( [mn] )) 

371.05 376.42 A: [mn] that's so funny that's what they do all day when you're not home [laughter] [laughter] 

374.24 379.82 B: exactly and you know i i was cleaning ah spring cleaning last year and i ah 

379.62 392.16 B: had a friend of mine pull my stove out and i was like oh my goodness [laughter] i mean everything i had ever lost you know like ink pens and things of that nature were under the stove where the cat had pushed them under the stove 

384.03 384.67 A: [mn] 

388.21 389.17 A: uh-huh 

389.70 390.38 A: (( [mn] )) 

391.43 393.15 A: [laughter] 

392.12 395.65 B: so it's like i say i need to start checking a little more often 

395.45 399.97 A: yeah [laughter] and how how long have you had them are they old now or 

399.06 405.53 B: um well actually they're just at a year old right and but one they were both been 

402.38 403.53 A: oh okay 

405.90 410.63 B: um spa- well not spayed i guess it's neutered with the female cat and um 

409.64 410.97 A: they have been 

410.51 419.74 B: yeah they have been and um they're just ah they're getting huge you know [laughter] and the last time i took them to the vet um he was telling me you know 

415.10 416.84 A: [laughter] 

419.60 426.85 B: you probably need to ah put them on a diet and don't leave food down all day and 'cause they- they're rather large 

426.33 427.50 A: [mn] huh 

427.28 430.82 A: that's so funny because my cat i don't know he just he's 

430.59 438.42 A: i think maybe he's anorexic or something he's so skinny i mean he doesn't really look sick but he's just he's he's definitely very skinny and 

438.21 442.00 A: i do leave food out for him all the time and i mean sometimes with 

441.83 446.41 A: like you know i always leave him a bowl of dry food like i just keep it full all the time and you know 

446.24 447.34 B: right 

446.26 449.01 A: it's like he he knows he doesn't overeat 

448.85 463.50 A: and then the wet food sometimes he's very picky about it and i'll just leave it until he eats it because i don't like to waste you know i know if i put a ne- a new one down he'll just let it sit there until he's read- you know until he gets some food that he likes [laughter] he needs like gourmet food 

455.34 456.35 B: right 

463.26 469.60 A: so um i don't know i don't know if that has to do with the you know i it's really weird he's keeps 

468.32 478.60 B: you know what i think ah my sister has a male cat and i just don't think male cats gain weight like female cats i really don't because he's the same way 

472.24 473.22 A: mhm 

478.64 480.99 B: and he eats all the time 

478.87 479.48 A: (( [mn] )) 

480.77 481.61 A: huh 

481.20 485.74 B: and he's just really long and his legs are really long and skinny 

485.29 490.32 A: yeah that's how mi- mines mine's very sleek looking [laughter] he 

488.28 494.01 B: right yeah i think it's just the i think it has something to do with ah being a male cat 

493.72 501.75 A: yeah could be maybe it's like people [laughter] i think women like to eat more than men usually so i don't know [laughter] but 

498.28 499.42 B: right 

500.50 510.95 B: you know i i wanted to get a boy girl and um i had there was um six kittens out of this litter and then i ah all my friends talked me out of it and they said that probably wasn't a 

510.93 525.12 B: very good idea even having them fixed they said there was confrontation like you said i guess in real life [laughter] so um so i ended up with two girls but they're really sweet i i i think girl cats are a lot sweeter than boy cats 

511.05 511.80 A: (( yeah )) 

514.98 515.96 A: really 

516.99 518.22 A: [laughter] 

525.02 534.63 A: that's funny i never even like really thought about that you know about ah i don't know like if there was really that much of a difference in the way male and female cats act [laughter] [mn] 

531.80 532.98 B: right 

533.63 546.64 B: yeah i i think their temperament's probably a little bit different like i said my sister has a male cat and well i mean ah you know i guess her perspective is different than mine because ah he's a one person cat he's very accustomed to her 

546.37 547.37 A: uh-huh 

546.65 549.96 B: but um he has nothing to do with other people 

549.59 551.20 A: [laughter] 

550.11 559.40 B: you know other people go in the house and he has absolutely nothing to do with them but my cats are friendly they like seeing people you know they come in they get in their lap and 

558.73 568.79 A: yeah that's how mine is too i like any attention he can get anyone he can get to scratch his cheek or pet him [laughter] he loves 

564.72 567.57 B: oh yeah 

567.99 576.83 B: yeah mine are the same way my black one's stretching out now he's or she is stretching oh she's about a foot long [laughter] when she stretches out 

575.17 582.26 A: oh [laughter] yeah i got mine um [mn] was actually when i guess for 

582.17 595.46 A: maybe his first two months he actually lived with his sister and then [mn] him and his sister had babies [laughter] [laughter] so my friend actually my friend had him and his sister and she was living um 

589.08 590.64 B: oh no 

595.58 599.89 A: she was living in an apartment where the peo- the neighbors um below them supposed-
