17.73 19.83 A: i don't either [laughter] 

22.87 26.94 A: [laughter] that's a good idea [mn] 

26.29 35.38 B: ah i have one friend in particular who has um sh- she's impoverish- her impoverishing herself over cats 

35.09 36.33 A: oh 

35.67 37.01 B: um 

36.83 41.18 A: meaning having to spend a lot of money on vets and that sort of thing 

39.77 42.83 B: that's exactly right yes yeah 

41.29 47.00 A: yes i've known people who have done that also i have a brother in law and sister in law who did that 

47.30 48.90 A: with a dog 

48.38 51.00 B: ah yeah um 

51.34 59.02 B: years and years ago i had um a roommate who had a pet um a minor bird and i 

59.17 67.71 B: we- we're we're in philadelphia and there's a a veterinary school here university of pennsylvania has a veterinary school 

59.72 60.92 A: (( [noise] )) 

67.07 71.90 A: oh sure my husband went to the university of pennsylvania mhm 

69.72 71.10 B: (( is that right )) 

71.17 74.19 B: um not to study veterinary medicine though i imagine 

73.38 76.11 A: no no [laughter] 

74.28 81.24 B: [laughter] and ah the minor bird fell off its perch ah new year's eve 

81.05 81.89 A: (( mm )) 

81.39 83.30 B: (( and ah )) 

83.43 93.23 B: we called the veterinary school and they told us um we could have it autopsied we should put it in the refrigerator 

84.46 85.41 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

90.26 91.68 A: oh no 

92.70 95.89 A: (( [laughter] how bizarre )) 

93.63 99.60 B: and um i balked at that you know put the a dead bird in the refrigerator 

96.74 98.40 A: i can understand 

99.20 100.46 A: right 

99.72 108.74 B: so we actually get this on new year's eve took the bird to the veterinary school and two young men um 

108.95 117.95 B: got up and um a- were very kind and helpful to look after this dead bird i was really impressed with that 

115.46 126.96 A: [laughter] oh [laughter] they must not have had much of another social life going on for new year's eve although some of us might prefer to do that on new year's leave eve rather than party 

121.69 123.47 B: yeah i guess 

126.45 130.04 B: that's right it's safer certainly but 

128.82 131.50 A: [laughter] [laughter] well my husband's ah 

131.78 137.42 A: oh ah his former wife has a um ah [lipsmack] 

137.78 143.30 A: parrot and she takes the parrot to a psychiatrist 

138.55 139.65 B: uh-huh 

142.57 145.53 B: are you're kidding me [laughter] 

143.34 144.48 A: no 

144.55 148.83 A: no and actually she herself is involved in 

148.81 155.31 A: holistic veterinarism and and um works in a holistic veterinary 

151.39 152.42 B: wow 

155.08 168.46 A: um office where they do acupuncture and acupressure and ah use herbs and all sorts of things in order to cure the animals something called zero balancing which is a particular type of 

167.77 172.22 B: this is astonishing to me really yeah 

169.32 175.13 A: it it is it is and the and i've heard of other people who have um 

175.41 178.27 A: used psychiatrists for their pets as well 

178.23 179.51 B: gee 

179.05 186.94 A: well and i think she really needs to do this with this parrot because ah this parrot definitely needs some anger management i think 

185.83 195.59 B: yeah but you know may- well wh- who can blame it it's probably living in a cage or shut up in you know anywhere except in parrot heaven but um ah y- 

189.98 191.24 A: [laughter] 

193.17 194.63 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

194.94 199.99 A: and you know that i i've always felt that about pets ah which is probably why i don't have one 

199.57 201.05 B: yeah 

200.59 210.12 A: because i feel like it's it's not [sigh] kind to the animals to to keep them in the house all day long or whatever 

208.40 209.43 B: yeah 

209.68 223.25 B: well you know some people live in the in the semi out of doors at least i mean you can let your dog go out and walk in the neighborhood or your cat cats tend to be able to go in and out um you know yeah depending on how you 

213.50 214.83 A: (( [mn] right )) 

220.20 221.76 A: much more so 

223.01 224.07 A: yeah 

223.48 227.70 B: i live in a building that does not allow pets but um 

226.23 227.36 A: (( ah )) 

227.67 242.40 B: because dogs couldn't recognize the difference apparently between um out of the apartment and out of the building so that they were n- n- nastying the hallways and the elevators um 

236.41 237.31 A: ah 

237.71 238.50 A: (( ew )) 

239.67 240.93 A: yes 

241.01 255.25 A: yes oh how awful well i i have lived we we currently live up in cambridge massachusetts and we live in a duplex on the first floor and there are quite a few animals around in the neighborhood dogs and so forth 

242.44 243.13 B: but 

255.36 260.78 A: [mn] then i remember when my daughter was growing up she wanted a a dog very badly and i 

260.74 272.32 A: told her i didn't think that it was kind to the animals to have to be in the house all day long when we weren't there they were all the animal would have to be all alone and then 

268.99 269.86 B: yeah 

271.54 272.54 B: right 

272.22 277.11 A: have to be walked on a leash the only time it was going to be outside 

275.30 276.19 B: yeah 

276.72 277.94 B: yeah 

277.53 279.86 A: it just doesn't seem fair 

279.27 284.77 B: right yeah well cats take to to being housebound um pretty well 

284.23 290.82 A: that's right i understand that that they do especially if they're declawed but then that's a whole nother issue too evidently 

285.48 286.47 B: yeah 

289.33 291.30 B: yeah i know yeah 

291.16 292.18 A: so 

292.23 296.98 A: i've always been kind of on the fence about it our our kids have a um 

297.14 307.70 A: beautiful dog up in burlington vermont and they live in the kind of area where they can just open the door and the dog can go racing out and around to the fields and all of that sort of thing 

304.99 305.90 B: right 

307.72 316.99 A: but then they put the dog in the house during the day when they're not there and the dog is is by itself all day long and it's a very social animal 

316.78 319.75 B: the a dog is a social animal yeah 

318.05 320.68 A: yeah their dog is 

320.01 320.90 B: right 

320.90 322.95 A: actually smiles at us 

322.38 327.44 B: oh really [laughter] i don't think i've ever seen a dog smile you know 

325.70 336.26 A: [laughter] [laughter] it's very cute it's an australian shepherd they're supposed to be a very very intelligent breed they're the dogs that they call frisbee dogs 

328.27 329.18 B: yeah 

329.81 330.79 B: uh-huh 

335.99 337.04 B: uh-huh 

336.99 338.04 A: so 

337.81 338.98 B: yeah 

338.69 344.79 A: [lipsmack] but yes um people do very strange things and then of course they have the pet cemeteries too you know 

344.33 347.14 B: oh yes that's another one um 

346.02 346.93 A: yes 

347.20 357.13 B: although i don't know that ah i don't think we did any special burial for that for that minor bird i think they ah disposed of it for us but 

352.49 353.77 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

356.96 363.48 B: th- that that particular roommate then later got herself a dog a german shepherd that she slept with um 

362.48 363.77 A: oh yes 

363.50 365.27 B: until she got married 

364.74 366.09 A: oh yes 

365.29 371.40 B: and ah the the the wedding i think her marriage i- i- it was ah a- 

371.73 381.33 B: m- delayed for i mean they they couldn't set a date because he drew his th- the line at living with the dog so um 

373.74 374.84 A: [laughter] 

379.19 380.37 A: oh yes 

381.28 390.34 B: they waited ah a few months or and of course the dog was older by then but i think it was finally helped to go to ah doggy heaven yeah 

381.47 382.37 A: [laughter] 

389.00 392.27 A: oh really oh must have been traumatic for her 

391.77 400.59 B: well i think she was really more interested in sleeping with the guy than sleeping with the dog which i take is a wholesome thing yes yeah 

397.23 399.06 A: finally [laughter] 

400.20 407.22 A: [laughter] i did know a couple that i used to live down in new jersey who lived in [mn] 

400.78 401.72 B: (( ah )) 

407.57 411.60 A: a a beautiful house and he was a lawyer and she was 

411.77 421.94 A: one of the heirs to the um estee lauder um company yes and they had two beautiful huge grea- great danes 

415.14 416.42 B: oh really 

421.30 422.18 B: (( mm )) 

421.98 428.93 A: and um they did allow the dogs to sleep in their beds with them under the covers 

426.70 427.60 B: mm 

429.00 433.31 A: and i remember going to dinner one time at their house and um 

433.33 439.15 A: they allowed the dogs to eat off the plates at the dinner table while they were eating 

436.34 437.40 B: (( oh )) 

437.48 442.74 B: now that i would really find that pretty difficult to deal with yeah 

441.58 450.31 A: [mn] it was [laughter] awful terrible terrible terrible but they didn't seem to find that there was anything unusual about it at all 

442.95 443.94 B: yeah 

445.36 446.35 B: yeah 

450.77 460.54 B: well i think humans i mean from the time we've got dogs around i think you know a dog's kept you safe and they've chased the rats and things i mean they're useful um 

458.33 459.25 A: right 

460.46 469.78 B: but i don't know about um letting them in bed with you and ah letting them eat at the same table that you do that's that's pushing it i think 

463.60 464.96 A: no [laughter] 

467.51 468.68 A: right 

469.33 475.63 A: well but and i also um believe that the companionship of animals particularly in 

475.98 479.60 A: special situations um they find with um 

479.18 481.37 B: older people yeah 

479.48 491.83 A: older individuals particularly if they are alone or they've ah they've had a spouse that has passed away and now they're alone they find that they're very very good actually and i can definitely see that 

485.42 486.36 B: yeah 

492.14 496.84 A: and perhaps some day when i get to that point i might choose that also 

496.44 498.35 B: yeah well 

497.86 499.26 A: (( so [lipsmack] )) 

498.43 513.43 B: i think my friend who've had who's had the several cats and has recently ah pa- paid out r- really i mean i i wouldn't say that the doctor's fees are exorbitant i mean the things they do for the animals are time consuming and expensive but 

511.67 512.59 A: right 

513.28 526.28 B: ah i i don't think she- she's going to keep any more cats after the the last one that's left with her finally goes although though we will have to see how if she if she really 

521.67 522.34 A: (( [mn] )) 

522.56 523.70 A: mhm 

526.85 532.06 B: misses having any but she won't go back to having three again i'm pretty sure of that no 

531.28 538.10 A: probably not i had an aunt ah or i still do have an aunt who lives on an island up in maine 

532.18 533.43 B: yeah 

538.50 545.56 A: she's the only one who lives on the island and at one time she had she wouldn't even tell us how many cats 

544.96 546.82 B: (( [laughter] )) 

545.78 557.38 A: that she had [laughter] and she's finally let them kinda all die away because she thought she was in fact going to pass away but she's lived much longer than she thought she was going to 

547.20 547.90 B: (( right )) 

556.02 558.32 B: uh-huh yeah 

557.42 562.41 A: and i think some of the cats are beginning to wander back again and ah 

562.46 569.36 A: inhabit her island and her house again but she had turned over a a whole portion of her house just to the cats 

569.34 573.99 B: she sounds a rather eccentric woman living on an island all by herself 

571.45 572.91 A: she is 

573.44 576.38 A: oh yes she is quite eccentric 

576.09 577.20 B: wow 

576.71 577.88 A: yes 

577.50 581.40 B: did she use a boat to get to and from her island or does sh- oh 

579.87 580.67 A: yeah 

580.72 582.29 A: yes she did 

581.71 585.03 B: and she rowed it herself or she motorboat or 

582.43 583.01 A: (( [mn] )) 

584.25 594.16 A: it was a little motorboat yep and now she's she's past the point where she can do that so she has somebody staying with her on the island um 

589.87 590.83 B: yeah 

594.14 599.89 A: and i'm su- think she's very sad about the fact that she can't go back and forth too much but she's actually
