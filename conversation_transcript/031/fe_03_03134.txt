159.95 171.02 A: and so that they they they ah they run very fast and ah yeah i think it's practically impossible to outrun one of them unless you're in phenomenally good shape and 

160.19 161.11 B: (( ahah )) 

170.78 176.44 B: ahah well that's cool i had two little dogs a little terrier mutt

179.32 180.16 A: (( ah ahah )) 

180.03 183.14 B: like half cocker half poodle they call it cockapoo 

183.40 184.22 A: (( ahah )) 

183.46 196.60 B: and yeah they were these little dogs they'd run around on all the furniture and [mn] jump up on my bed and stuff they were both really old they were like they were like fourteen or fifteen i think they've been around for a while 

194.70 197.18 A: (( wow that's really old for a dog now )) 

197.25 200.90 B: yeah i know they've ah they've been around for a while they've got ah 

201.42 209.84 B: one of 'em's going blind and the other one's going deaf so i always say they're like richard pryor and gene wilder in that movie but 

207.77 211.68 A: (( [laughter] [mn] right right with ah )) 

211.82 217.07 B: my mom spends a lot of time with them i mean i think she has them instead of like other children 

217.71 220.84 A: [cough] right yeah 

217.79 218.81 B: i don't know 

218.87 219.99 B: she calls 

221.32 226.57 A: does does your mom did did are are any of your siblings still at home with your mom or 

221.65 223.45 B: yeah 

226.67 234.25 B: no no no just just her and the dogs [mn] the dogs are my siblings that are left at home apparently 

230.30 230.86 A: (( [mn] )) 

233.81 238.94 A: right so they and they probably fill a huge ah huge gap ah ah 

239.91 240.86 A: (( i mean )) 

240.16 242.87 B: yeah they're her companions right now aren't they 

243.53 248.74 B: i don't know i think she'd get rid of the house before she got rid of the dogs [laughter] 

247.48 248.23 A: (( wow )) 

248.42 255.29 A: yeah well plus she's probably used to having somebody to take care of or you know or wants to 

255.61 261.90 A: ah i mean ah er i i guess i mean if if you if you had a big family and stuff and she was used to 

262.14 269.60 A: having a lot of people in the house that she took care of that she fed and stuff y- you know those those instincts don't go away easily so 

268.98 270.82 B: yeah exactly 

271.16 279.94 B: you know she talks to 'em and she lets 'em sleep in her room and stuff so [mn] i don't know my roommate's that way with his cat [mn] 

276.74 277.53 A: (( oh oh oh )) 

279.95 290.62 B: he's nuts about that cat like he's got like this giant picture of the cat on his wall and he always come in like making loud noises saying hello to the cat and [mn] the cat eats like 

290.56 299.84 B: a five course meal it gets like dried cat food the canned cat food whipped cream fish tuna i mean it's disgusting how much that cat eats 

299.72 302.58 A: it seems like one well fed cat 

302.17 311.89 B: no it's a thin cat it's not like i mean he doesn't need to eat a lot it's just he gets all this different variety like i said he gets he gets like a five course meal 

308.45 309.65 A: oh [mn] oh i see 

311.83 317.67 A: yeah [mn] well so i don't know i mean somehow i've never actually felt 

317.72 322.80 A: [mn] ah i mean somehow dogs seem very friendly to me 

322.30 324.40 B: yeah cats are little punks 

325.10 329.46 A: um ah yeah and i guess there is only this ah sort of ah 

329.85 333.30 A: there's cat people and there are dog people right so 

332.70 341.75 B: yeah exactly i'm more of a dog person 'cause you can't really play with a cat [mn] 'cause you know if you want to try and play with a cat the cat'll just like say like screw you and walk away 

341.82 347.87 A: ah and ah they tend to have um i don't know i mean [mn] [cough] actually my neighbor used to have cats 

342.18 342.99 B: (( you know )) 

347.62 349.96 B: mhm 

348.31 349.53 A: and ah 

349.59 361.22 A: a couple of times i have actually seen them ah i have actually seen them having moods bad enough that they would actually scratch you with their ah claws 

361.30 362.55 A: (( and right )) 

361.37 363.86 B: yeah that hurts i don't like that 

364.82 373.62 B: my friend had his cat declawed so that wasn't that bad 'cause then the cat couldn't scratch me when it walked all over me [mn] my dad has cats and i go stay at my dad's and [mn] 

373.74 381.23 B: there's like they'll be sleeping and all of a sudden like i'll just wake up and the cat'll be walking up my chest digging its claws into my shirt 

381.24 382.20 A: (( oh )) 

381.56 385.30 B: or i woke up once and the cat was sitting on my head [laughter] 

385.68 388.26 A: yeah that can be scary i guess 

388.17 391.44 B: [mn] it was just it was just annoying 

388.44 394.38 A: ah yeah i mean especially depending on if you had some kind of dream or something 

394.42 400.72 B: yeah [laughter] yeah well [mn] i don't know i wanna get fish 

396.73 397.29 A: (( [mn] )) 

401.52 408.60 A: yeah f- actually my ah ah daughter i mean she's just like a few months old now she's less than a year 

408.62 411.04 A: (( and ah [cough] recently [lipsmack] )) 

409.67 412.54 B: (( yeah )) 

411.46 423.56 A: we went over to some people's house ah who and and they have a a sort of a small fish tank and she was absolutely fascinated with these ah with these bright little fish that used to 

417.06 417.94 B: (( ahah )) 

423.63 436.79 A: the colors used to change as they sort of like swam around in the tank and as you know they changed direction and as the fins you know moved away from her the colors used to change she was just absolutely fascinated by 

436.87 448.16 B: yeah [mn] yeah [mn] yeah i can see that fish are great i mean my friend had this giant fish tank with these tropical fish in it and there was like you know a light on it when it was dark and so 

436.87 437.97 A: the whole thing 

444.72 445.41 A: (( ahah )) 

448.17 454.03 B: [mn] you know you can just sit there and watch the fish for ever [laughter] but 

452.14 460.80 A: right oh but you know if you if your if your ah if your roommate has a cat and you have a fish tank that might not be a good roommate combination 

461.52 468.02 B: yeah i always thought that was a myth that cats eat fish but somebody like i read somewhere that 

468.10 471.14 B: cats eat more fish than any other animal 

470.94 478.05 B: like overall like more fish are eaten by cats than any other animal [mn] i figured it'd be like bears or something like that but it's actually fish 

477.94 487.88 B: cats it seemed kinda weird i don't know i don't know if that's because people feed the cats fish or what but cats eat more fish than any other animal so i don't know [mn] 

479.24 480.28 A: (( [cough] right )) 

486.51 487.61 A: right 

487.59 502.10 A: well but you're right though i mean it could be a myth in terms of actual- ah whether it actually happens in in if they're wild cats but if they're bred at home and and all you feed them is purely like cat chow that has all this fish in it then 

502.36 505.26 A: (( ah i don't know i mean )) 

504.44 511.84 B: yeah i i didn't think that would that would count you'd think that'd be different but [mn] i don't know i didn't get the specifics of the whole thing 

512.05 515.35 A: [mn] right but ah well once you get your fish tank you'll find out [mn] 

515.35 529.62 B: yeah totally i mean i want one of those really big ones with the tropical fish and the light and all that fun stuff somebody told me that tropical fish are really hard to m- to maintain because you have to clean the water so much 'cause it's salt water but 

521.29 522.15 A: right 

529.68 531.11 A: yeah well i mean 

529.73 531.36 B: [mn] it seems like it'd be worth it 

531.99 537.84 A: ah and and plus depending on where you live i don't know if the climate matters the weather 

538.26 541.42 B: oh really that can actually affect it 

541.47 549.43 A: ah yeah yeah i don't know if you're used to having a lot of ah if you're used to the water being very warm or but i guess 

548.18 549.52 B: oh 

549.74 555.00 A: i guess anyway i mean the tanks probably have all sorts of controls on them to keep the temperature 

553.79 558.44 B: yeah you d- they probably have temp controls in the light [mn] 

557.46 558.42 A: right 

558.55 562.63 B: the light the light the heat light probably helps too i don't know [mn] 

562.75 572.08 A: yeah i mean the thing about pets that i mean the reason i don't have pets any more even though i would love to have a dog is [mn] is is the maintenance i mean it 

572.49 575.19 A: takes a lot it's a lot of work 

572.53 574.25 B: yeah totally 

574.88 581.60 B: like i remember when i was a kid when my mom first got the dog and there was pee and crap all over the house and i don't really want to deal with that right now 

579.31 580.26 A: right 

581.74 586.98 A: right and ah this ah this i was reading the latest reader's digest 

586.94 598.83 A: and and ah and it had a a comment by meryl streep [mn] where she was saying that ah the strange thing about being a mother is that everybody wants to have pets but i'm the only one cleaning the poop [mn] 

587.06 589.01 B: yeah 

592.01 592.88 B: oh 

599.05 599.95 B: [laughter]
