109.13 123.48 A: i know he was eighteen years old though like he was very old and we knew he'd he'd gotten sick like in october or so and um i had to give him pills three times a day which it's really hard to do 

111.20 112.13 B: oh 

121.11 122.21 B: oh man 

122.76 127.13 B: well that's like my ex boyfriend we were really really close in you know high school sweethearts blah blah blah 

126.78 127.87 A: mhm 

126.96 141.75 B: but ah his mother was a greyhound rescuer so she would go up to tucson and get the greyhounds but the thing was he'd had a terrier since he was like two or three it was a house full of animals they had like at any given point they'd have three or four dogs plus the cats plus the frogs plus the la la la 

130.63 131.76 A: oh 

141.55 150.98 B: plus the lizard plus the fish but ah at any rate his little terrier got diabetes so like every night we had to give it like an insulin shot when i'd be over there for dinner or whatever 

142.69 144.29 A: (( [laughter] )) 

150.15 151.86 A: mhm 

150.87 157.53 B: and eventually like the greyhounds just terrorized the poor thing to death [laughter] and i'm like i'm never having dogs 

155.15 156.77 A: (( oh )) 

157.70 158.33 A: (( no )) 

157.78 159.34 B: (( [laughter] no they're evil )) 

159.26 168.02 A: well yeah yeah i mean yeah because my my my cat he lasted for like you know another three or four months but they told me that you know his kidneys were going and 

167.89 177.00 A: it ended up to where i just like had to put him down and i cried for two days it's like ah i just it's like i'm this old woman here crying over her cat 

172.32 173.35 B: oh 

175.44 183.48 B: [laughter] well and like when denver died that was the name of his little terrier when denver died i he and i actually we came home for lunch 

183.45 190.32 B: and ah his mom had taken the greyhounds out and we were at his house for lunch and there's denver like curled up in his little doggy bed and john was like 

190.10 202.65 B: oh i'm going to play with denver you know denver's sick you know one of those little sensitive boys i don't know how he's got on in high sch- but he's like oh denver's sick and he goes to like play with his dog and his dog's like lying there dead and i think that was like the first time i ever saw a guy cry like in my life 

199.56 201.73 A: oh 

202.23 204.25 A: (( i know )) 

202.59 206.30 B: (( i was like oh no denver died )) 

204.87 205.61 A: (( i )) 

206.07 213.13 A: was like that and you know my husband never liked these cats but still he even though he won't admit it he's kind of attached to them 

212.72 214.92 B: exactly well it's like ah 

213.27 214.35 A: (( you know )) 

215.33 217.79 B: it it yeah [laughter] 

217.11 220.60 A: and because when i had and this this cat's name was amos i 

220.68 227.73 A: had they were brothers amos and andy and i still have andy he's still around but [laughter] oh i've got an eighteen year old cat still 

222.81 223.78 B: oh 

227.64 234.52 B: oh well it was just cute because ah the other dog one of the greyhounds that actually belonged to them that wasn't a rescue was tanner who was also john's dog 

234.48 243.71 B: so ah there was tanner and denver big old greyhound little bitty terrier who'd been buddies for like ever and when denver died tanner was like he needed doggy prozac he was so depressed [laughter] 

241.99 244.04 A: oh i know it 

244.05 253.59 A: and they get that way i mean i thought i was bad but you know the other cats would just like walk around and crying and looking and and 'cause he was kind of the glue the one that died was kind of the glue for all of them 

253.48 260.79 A: it's like oh no amy's gone and there's you know nobody nobody does kisses and hugs anymore nobody snuggles and

261.77 264.35 A: like amos's job but 

263.52 276.48 B: what i find so interesting is like how pets like because i had a hermit crab for years and years and years and it's like little bitty hermit crab and when he died i mean i was just as traumatized as if he'd been like a little cat who'd been sleeping in my bed for years instead of this 

276.55 280.15 B: little bug like thing in the cage in the living room you know 

278.78 281.57 A: (( [laughter] yeah ))
