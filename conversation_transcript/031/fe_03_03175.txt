158.74 161.33 A: oh i think i know what you're talking about 

160.37 165.39 B: yeah so they had one of those but they had like twelve weimaraners 

165.63 167.27 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

166.46 173.18 B: yeah and they knew they knew like they all looked the same to me but to this 

172.01 174.15 A: uh-huh they could tell the difference 

173.63 177.15 B: they could tell the difference i'm like they all look the same 

177.18 184.65 B: what are you talking about that one's coco they're like no that one's caesar and that one's coco and that one's lulu and i was like all right whatever 

184.56 187.19 A: did they breed them is that why they had so many 

186.21 187.72 B: um 

187.81 189.45 B: i don't know i just 

189.90 196.26 B: not really i mean i guess in the end you could say that they were breeding them because like they they all had a bunch of puppies but 

196.47 206.67 B: um i don't think they started out trying to breed them they just like like they had a big property so they needed like dogs just to watch it so i guess 

206.40 207.38 A: right 

207.07 210.41 B: they bought a bunch but then i guess they got more than they 

210.53 212.54 B: they really needed in the end 

212.48 214.55 A: [laughter] oh my gosh in 

213.11 219.78 B: i have no idea but oh my god i love dogs i really want one but it's so evil to have one in an apartment building 

220.58 221.94 A: an apartment building 

221.34 222.38 B: yeah 

222.07 224.28 A: (( see that's me i'm in an apartment too so )) 

225.01 228.27 A: i guess i just don't have the time i had it my dog died last year 

227.93 229.78 B: (( oh that's sad )) 

228.95 232.15 A: she was a purebred english bulldog 

231.71 232.92 B: (( oh oh )) 

232.45 234.72 A: and she was just like my baby so 

235.00 237.75 A: it's kinda hard to get another one because 

237.73 239.00 B: (( that's cute )) 

237.89 241.95 A: i don't i don't have the time i don't have a house any more either i'm in an apartment so 

241.20 242.48 B: yeah 

242.07 243.76 A: i just don't think it's fair 

243.53 257.34 B: yeah the apartment thing is i i mean you know eventually i mean i don't see myself living in a house any time really soon so i i may just get one but if i do it's going to be like a really small one that can manage it 

257.62 259.19 B: um you know 

257.68 258.60 A: yeah 

259.20 260.31 B: probably 

259.40 265.97 A: these two that's why these two are really good i mean they have a house and they have a fence there but she's such a real puppy they don't want her out all day 

265.72 266.61 B: yeah 

266.74 273.24 A: and so they pay me to come over three times a week while they're at work and take her out and walk with her and 

270.96 272.02 B: mhm 

272.93 280.88 B: mhm that's the other thing my schedule is so erratic that it it really wouldn't be fair to a dog right this minute 

280.80 285.86 A: yeah yeah exactly so it it's good for her i mean she's 

286.64 292.70 A: i can't i can't imagine a puppy being in a 'cause they crate during the day they put her in the kitchen during the in the crate 

291.94 293.06 B: (( mm )) 

292.74 296.21 A: and i just i can't imagine her being in that crate all day long 

296.03 297.76 B: yeah yeah 

297.49 300.61 A: i mean i just i don't get that so 

300.34 315.02 B: yeah we we we used to crate our dogs but like we we i guess we didn't really do it we we had the crate and they they'd sit in their crates but they wouldn't like they wouldn't have to be there they could they could move around if they want 

312.29 313.35 A: right 

314.39 315.92 A: they liked it 

315.20 316.32 B: yeah 

316.10 317.39 A: it's like their bed 

317.09 322.59 B: yeah exactly and that was when that was only with the little dogs we had um 

322.96 326.09 B: we had miniature wire haired dachshunds 

326.35 327.59 A: oh my god 

327.56 328.42 B: and then 

327.92 329.50 A: those are cute 

328.93 336.35 B: yeah we had all kinds of dogs we had from like the smallest to the largest 'cause we had a great dane and we had miniature wire haired dachshunds 

336.41 339.41 B: and then in between that we had ridgebacks 

336.45 337.95 A: oh my god 

339.67 340.72 A: what are those 

339.77 350.19 B: and then um ridgebacks they're they're african dogs they're african lion hunting dogs but they have a ridge like you've probably seen them they're kind of um 

349.96 351.65 A: yeah i think i know what you mean 

350.88 363.77 B: a chestnutty color but they have this kind of weird thing on the top of their backs which when they're angry it flares up and it looks like a ridge yeah so they're really sturdy dogs they're they're like the same build as rotts really 

356.86 357.95 A: right 

363.92 365.63 A: uh-huh and they're like 

364.03 371.22 B: but they have they don't have a soft um fur and um we had those and then we had 

371.69 378.67 B: we randomly got which was funny but we randomly got a rhodesian ridgeback ah great dane mix 

378.45 379.72 A: (( [laughter] oh my god )) 

378.92 381.18 B: so she had like the big
