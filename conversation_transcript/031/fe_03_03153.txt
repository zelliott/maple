39.83 41.83 B: yes large dogs and and so forth 

41.19 53.03 A: well it's not necessarily the size [noise] of the dog it's the type of the dog okay like a uh um a australian [noise] shepherd very small dog but they're a working dog 

50.60 51.51 B: okay 

52.69 55.56 B: right they're designed to be out there

55.66 56.68 B: yeah 

58.85 61.73 A: and also size of dog i guess has some influence also 

61.83 65.74 B: right um because like people have small apartments and

93.78 101.08 B: right and so the horses are actually pets for you not workhorses or racing horses or anything they're actually just for fun 

100.97 104.27 A: (( [noise] yeah yeah i mean i ri- i )) 

102.51 103.47 B: nice 

104.33 107.70 A: have i done other stuff with them yeah have i worked with them yes 

107.72 118.49 A: i mean a friend of mine is a is uh is that's what he does he's a cowboy for a living so i we i went out with him and we tried to chase down wild horses when we were in california i wasn't very good at it [laughter] 

107.85 108.47 B: (( but )) 

115.85 116.82 B: okay 

117.56 119.12 B: [laughter] 

119.05 123.41 A: but he was very good at it um but no they're more pleasure than anything else 

123.42 126.44 A: they are a couple of work show horses and they they're out of shows now 

127.22 128.39 B: (( that's great if )) 

127.42 129.30 A: so i have four 

130.18 136.87 A: um and then i had another couple i had i had a couple of dogs there and uh barn cats you have to have ca- if you have a barn you have to have cats 

137.55 140.53 B: you have what a barn yeah to chase the mice away 

138.54 142.90 A: yeah yeah well 

141.85 146.78 B: [sigh] yes a lot of my friends have cats or are cat people it seems uh 

145.99 147.86 A: yeah where do you live in manhattan 

147.57 148.74 B: (( yes )) 

148.23 153.14 A: right so you live in an apartment and if you're li- living in one of those huge homes yeah of course you know 

149.79 150.86 B: yeah 

153.58 157.46 A: um no i mean like i said i've i've never had a pet in new york and i wouldn't 

158.13 161.72 A: i know it just like i said seems cruel and i'm not uh i'm not a big cat person 

158.61 159.34 B: yeah 

161.41 164.37 B: [laughter] i like cats because 

164.50 167.21 B: they seem much more low maintenance than dogs are 

166.59 169.70 A: but cats don't mind they do what they want 

169.46 174.17 B: yeah and they don't care if you want to do something anyway you can't really train a cat 

173.82 176.75 A: (( well you know i i actually a friend of mine has a cat that fetches )) 

176.64 177.69 B: really 

177.11 179.78 A: yeah yeah but uh 

177.77 180.32 B: [laughter] that's impressive 

179.86 185.24 A: and uh you know i thought about ge- putting in an aquarium but you know i mean fish aren't fun to play with you know 

185.01 190.56 B: you right [laughter] although my parents have a cat and they have an aquarium as well 

185.88 187.01 A: [laughter] 

190.22 191.34 A: yeah 

190.72 194.80 B: and the cat will sit there for hours looking at the fish i think it's like 

193.37 196.39 A: but the cat's will but can you do that 

194.88 195.71 B: right 

195.72 199.55 B: right but i think the pets were really kept the fish were for him more or less 

199.73 203.05 B: um you know he'll sit there watching it like it's t._v. 

203.10 210.50 A: i mean i guess when i was young i drank a lot and smoked pot or did whatever i could stare at fish for a long time 

208.00 208.88 B: [laughter] 

209.85 212.80 B: [laughter] i suppose that when you 

213.23 216.67 B: raise your consciousness to that to cat level 

216.00 221.79 A: well whatever level you know sometimes below usu- usually below cat level i would guess and a cat level's kind of high 

217.49 218.27 B: right 

219.83 222.50 B: right cats are pretty smart yeah 

223.10 233.50 A: yeah but um no so i prefer like i said i outdoor animals and i i've i've always had dogs um and i had you know in and when i lived in california i lived in california most all my life 

228.77 229.62 B: mhm 

233.77 241.38 A: and i've always had dogs uh and then when i bought the ranch i got horses and actually got put some got some cows out there which aren't pets but they kind of are 

241.41 243.22 A: even though i slaughtered them you know 

243.12 244.25 B: [laughter] 

243.61 248.13 A: and um ducks and you know just everything 'cause i had i had a hundred and ten acres 

247.99 249.37 B: sounds great 

248.74 252.07 A: put fish in my pond you know used to catch 'em 

251.89 255.53 B: yeah to somebody who has spent most of his life in new york apartments 

255.11 256.19 A: yeah 

255.54 259.11 B: that just sounds fantastic having that much space and that much freedom 

257.26 258.02 A: well 

258.77 262.31 A: (( [laughter] well i grew up and i was born and raised in california you )) 

261.74 263.00 B: right 

262.32 265.29 A: know i had dog when i was growing up um 

265.92 273.36 A: went to school for when while i was while i was during going to school i didn't have a pet that was probably about the only time and then 

272.01 277.38 B: yeah yeah most schools seem don't seem very happy about pets at least not in dorm rooms 

275.75 276.56 A: well 

276.74 284.80 A: i only lived in a dorm room for a year so you know it wasn't that big a deal and then um by the end of my end of school i'd already bought a house so 

278.79 279.70 B: okay 

284.91 289.00 A: it uh yeah in fact i got a dog when i uh was doing that 

286.24 286.97 B: yeah 

289.13 291.59 B: what kind of dogs do you like 

290.60 294.50 A: [noise] um i like shepherds 

294.63 300.04 A: um i'd a german shepherd when i was growing up but then i had i had australian shepherds and belgian shepherds 

300.65 302.75 A: um red and whites 

302.87 303.85 A: um 

304.01 309.46 A: typically uh smaller other than the german um but considered smarter 

306.99 307.87 B: (( okay yeah right )) 

309.96 316.58 A: and uh m- yeah most of them have been more natural uh towards doing work 

317.11 320.74 A: uh i've never had a hunting dog 'cause i don't hunt 

321.20 322.11 A: so 

322.80 335.08 A: but uh like i said when i was up there above at my place i always had i always had cows and and you know would put some uh sheep out there sometimes and you know just the dog would take care of 'em i didn't have to do a thing so um i mean then it 

332.39 333.42 B: nice 

334.10 336.93 B: you took care of the dog the dog takes care of the cows 

336.36 340.56 A: right and then i had a belgian shepherd when i was in southern california 

340.88 343.10 A: um i don't know why i just stuck with shepherds 

343.41 347.80 A: because like they're supposed to be smarter than other dogs and you know i guess each dog is individual 

345.54 346.46 B: (( yeah and )) 

346.59 354.06 B: looking i suppose if you're a dog bred for working and doing something useful as opposed to bred for the best looking tail or fur or whatever 

353.37 358.48 A: [laughter] yeah i kind of laugh for the westchester pet- westchester dog show 

357.93 362.31 B: yeah i'm still trying to figure out how the thing got into category of sports 

362.33 365.95 B: it keeps being on the sports pages on of a newspaper as in 

364.31 365.11 A: well 

365.17 367.00 A: what else is it 

366.79 369.40 B: um entertainment i presume 

369.24 372.47 A: and were you are you entertained with your have you ever watched it 

371.90 375.64 B: no but i'm not entertained by mos- most t._v. out there either so 

374.98 384.19 A: well i know but if the you know i mean it doesn't entertain me i think it's you know course i i you know i don't even like horse shows i think horse shows are stupid um 

378.88 380.01 B: right 

383.96 390.44 A: main- mostly i think a lot of those shows are stu- animal shows are stupid because of the of the way they abuse the animal 

390.57 402.17 A: a lot of times in the training et cetera uh when i ride horses i don't even put a bit i their mouth i refuse to um a lot of people don't like you know frown on me for that but hey you know 

391.19 391.92 B: (( right )) 

401.59 403.74 B: [noise] what is the bit supposed to do 

403.85 406.65 A: a bit is what slows the horse down when you pull him back on the reins 

406.05 407.09 B: okay 

406.84 412.80 A: okay but he's got this metal piece in his mouth that he gags on basically and forces him to stop because he sometimes he can't breathe 

408.80 409.61 B: right 

412.73 414.61 B: so how do you rein in the horse 

414.01 417.98 A: i put a hackamore on which is a thing that brings the nose down 

417.88 418.84 B: okay 

418.44 423.34 A: i pull it back a little bit like that and some- and sometimes pinches a little bit on the bottom of the jaw 

423.52 425.59 B: okay so it's not as painful for the horse then 

423.87 428.36 A: uh depend- depending on the type yeah you know 

426.83 427.73 B: okay 

428.64 429.49 A: so 

430.18 432.39 A: i'm trying try and be more humane to him 

430.30 431.09 B: yeah 

432.34 436.18 B: yeah i always feel sorry for the horses pulling carriages in central park 

435.82 437.97 A: (( oh i hate 'em you know )) 

436.52 439.61 B: they seem to have awful working conditions 

438.34 439.16 A: yeah 

439.58 440.62 A: very poor 

440.73 448.01 A: very poor but again you know and [sigh] that's the same thing why why i don't like the dogs in apartments when in new york it just doesn't make any sense 

448.57 452.65 A: well i mean the dog gets out what twice a you know sometimes lets say twice a day 

452.93 457.76 A: let's say and let's say maybe three times a week 

452.94 454.48 B: (( yeah yeah if that yeah )) 

457.91 464.57 A: to some place where he can quote run inside a fenced thing at the park that's fifty feet long 

460.60 461.70 B: (( mm )) 

463.88 466.40 B: yeah a little tiny dog run yeah 

465.67 470.96 A: right i mean come on how many of those dogs actually get out and get to run and have fun 

470.90 472.20 B: never yeah 

472.15 474.84 A: i wo- i won't say never but you know very few 

473.87 474.47 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

474.56 476.01 B: yeah 

475.80 476.62 A: so 

477.24 480.56 A: (( you know and they say cats are dumb i don't know if cats were smart but they're )) 

480.59 481.45 A: you know 

481.46 482.97 A: they just don't pay attention 

483.55 490.71 B: well cats i mean as opposed to house cats are almost a separate breed aren't they i mean they're meant to live in apartments it seems 

491.12 492.07 B: um or 

492.20 493.53 A: well 

492.91 494.33 B: or are they 

494.51 497.49 B: would most house cats survive in the wild if they had to 

497.22 500.60 A: probably not i mean it's hard to say 

498.04 498.89 B: okay 

500.75 507.02 A: you know i mean depending how old they were and of course they have they couldn't have been de-clawed 

503.84 504.86 B: mhm 

506.80 507.95 B: right 

507.71 511.33 A: and um it just depends on their on their you know their 

511.37 512.26 A: you know 

512.30 514.98 A: themselves i mean are they tough or what you know 

514.92 515.78 B: [laughter] 

515.10 525.48 A: but i mean actually when they when they if they are born outside you know they learn to adapt a lot faster because i don't think it's necessary i mean you don't find a lot of siamese and fancy breeds outside okay 

519.51 520.44 B: yeah 

525.97 527.10 A: but um 

527.39 529.00 A: you know i've had some manx 

529.63 530.87 B: (( okay mm )) 

529.97 539.97 A: actually i had a i actually um had a kitten but it died okay i brought up from birth it was a calico male 

540.53 541.32 B: huh 

541.04 542.75 A: which doesn't exist 

543.20 545.84 B: [laughter] because of genetics 

545.68 548.15 A: yeah all calicoes are female 

545.85 547.03 B: (( right yeah )) 

549.42 554.19 A: okay if you ever find a calico male you'd you can become filthy filthy rich 

554.59 556.96 B: [sigh] so wh- what did you do with yours 

556.64 559.88 A: it died and right right after birth it didn't it didn't survive 

557.28 558.53 B: oh okay 

558.81 561.34 B: okay because it's not 

560.77 562.73 A: well yeah who knows you know 

561.51 563.32 B: not supposed to happen yeah 

562.87 564.62 A: uh i d- i found it dead 

564.39 565.30 B: okay 

565.39 577.68 A: right so i have no idea i mean you know when when a cat when an outdoor cat or the cats in general when they give birth they try and hide hide whe- before they give birth and when they're outside it's a lot easier for them to hide you 

569.98 570.72 B: mhm 

572.71 573.71 B: (( yeah )) 

578.85 583.94 A: know i mean you may you know all of a sudden you see the momma cat gone for a while and she comes and [mn] she's skinny 

583.75 584.72 B: [laughter] 

584.07 587.26 A: so she had the kittens somewhere and then you try to figure out where they are 

585.14 586.32 B: [laughter] right 

587.57 589.18 B: yeah try to find them 

588.64 593.66 A: you know it's a game so but uh then again i also have a pure white arab horse 

594.28 599.29 A: uh the problem is i got him from uh somebody who was abusing him and uh they'd gelded him 

599.43 599.89 A: (( because ))
