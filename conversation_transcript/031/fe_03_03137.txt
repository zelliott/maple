450.86 456.26 A: that's true sometimes the fish go crazy too i have i had a couple jump out of the tank 

455.07 457.32 B: oh i th- that's how my fish died 

457.15 458.88 A: (( yeah i don't know why )) 

457.98 460.56 B: i stepped on it in the middle of the night i was like what is that 

459.49 464.47 A: i'm the same i heard a sound and i was like what was that 

464.87 468.44 A: and suddenly the fish is on the floor flopping around 

467.86 471.15 B: i had an african ah cichlid do the same thing 

471.66 478.29 B: i i thought she just did it because she was just so hyper really like a kind of a spazzy fish you know 

475.03 475.60 A: (( [mn] )) 

478.30 479.03 A: (( okay )) 

478.53 484.56 B: but um then i gave my i gave him to my brother because i moved out of the country and 

484.66 488.76 B: i had given him an oscar as well and it was just a little tiny thing 

489.58 497.08 B: he divided it into another tank and it grew oh my gosh it was like the size of a a small ch- like a nerf ball 

496.95 497.82 A: huh 

497.38 509.08 B: it got it got huge and if you opened up your mouth and acted like you know opened your mouth towards the tank it would head butt the tank because it was putting up its defenses i guess to 

509.10 511.95 B: protect itself it felt like you were going to eat it maybe i don't know 

511.39 512.78 A: [laughter] 

511.98 512.95 B: (( [laughter] yeah it )) 

514.50 515.93 B: was a big fish 

516.12 522.20 B: and he gave it instead of giving it back to me like he probably should've done when he moved he gave it to some friend of his and they all 

522.42 524.14 B: [mn] i think poured beers in the [lipsmack] 

524.68 528.50 B: tried to get the fish drunk and poured beers in the um tank 

526.11 527.23 A: [laughter] 

527.35 529.00 A: that obviously killed it i guess 

528.60 529.75 B: yeah 

530.66 535.36 B: yeah it was it was a big fish i can't believe how big it got and it 'cause it almost died from the cichlid 

535.90 542.04 B: beating on it just swimming by and like taking chunks out of it so that's why we had to separate 'em [lipsmack] 

543.08 546.34 B: okay well i guess any time now they should be coming on and saying 

546.26 547.76 A: yeah thirty seconds 

547.44 548.39 B: yeah 

549.65 551.20 B: what's the weather like there
