106.56 110.53 A: common attack dog [mn] mix to her she was a real nice dog 

108.04 121.98 B: right yeah unfortunately when a dog's getting this label as being you know get a bad name [mn] like the pit bull and this kind of thing you know i don't think that's fair but ah i think it's more of a people thing than it is anything 

112.80 114.26 A: right right 

115.84 118.10 A: yeah yeah 

118.11 119.89 A: right 

120.97 125.36 A: right i think it's more how how they're trained yeah 

122.82 132.40 B: it is i think i think that's right the people that own 'em i think a lot of times got a lot to do with the way the animal turns out and i always say it's the responsibility of the animal [mn] 

129.39 130.56 A: mhm 

132.27 133.27 A: right 

132.43 135.77 B: keeper instead of the animal but um 

134.03 135.93 A: right right 

135.83 147.37 B: [lipsmack] we enjoy our cats at least we have enough room out here they run [mn] pretty well staying around home you know but ah they're no problem sometimes it's a little hectic around supper time but ah 

140.84 142.58 A: mhm 

144.39 147.07 A: mhm right [mn] 

147.44 157.90 B: [lipsmack] we really do enjoy 'em but ah i've always loved animals all kinds of varieties i've always well we've both been into birds for quite some time we like those we don't have any right now

165.45 166.19 A: (( ahah mhm )) 

166.13 172.16 B: and ah they're good now that we get captive born animals saves them from going out and getting them out of the wild [mn]

238.75 248.38 B: yeah well sometimes that's the best thing if you like 'em that's the best way to keep 'em if you start doing it as a vocation then i think you sometimes you burn out on it but ah 

246.42 247.68 A: right 

249.17 256.67 B: [mn] i think it's ah i- it's a good thing everybody needs something when they can get to the point where they can have a place of their own 

256.34 257.58 A: right 

256.73 270.35 B: you know and you can't let 'em kinda run i don't like putting anything up in a [mn] chain it up or anything like that our dog more or less she comes goes and she's old but now she's of course she's confined to the house mostly we we take her outside every day 

265.19 267.37 A: right right

318.52 320.05 A: yeah yeah 

320.45 322.27 B: [mn] it's highly acclaimed 

321.63 323.29 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

322.71 336.66 B: they ah they have a good programme down there i know i know 'cause i've got several friends that have attended college down there of course it's not only a university of course we have a big medical research centre there vanderbilt we have a big children's hospital there um 

332.13 334.03 A: mhm right yeah

339.12 340.86 B: yeah it is it's nice 

340.94 344.14 B: it's ah it's expanded a lot i know that 

342.92 345.16 A: yeah yeah 

344.31 351.00 B: but i know up in your area too they've expanded a lot of that ah a lot of the colleges up there i think have you know 

350.35 352.78 A: yeah boy syracuse is huge now 

352.34 361.94 B: oh yeah yeah i took a art course in syracuse as a matter of fact yeah we took a lot of ah [lipsmack] courses in art there we were speaking of pets it's ironic 'cause a lot of the ah 

354.87 355.81 A: oh yeah 

362.15 364.76 B: ah subjects we done were on pets 

364.44 365.13 A: (( hm )) 

364.94 370.88 B: that is odd but ah yeah i took a course up there really liked it you're right syracuse is a big college 

370.44 372.00 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

371.12 375.96 B: but ah we have a lot of people from down here go up there they they attend college up there 

375.24 380.26 A: yeah yeah i know i- it's an odd kind of thing you know we usually tend to switch 'cause um 

380.35 383.93 A: i know a lot of the people from the south like to come up here and ah a 

383.94 386.49 A: lot of people from up here like to go down there i don't know 

386.08 388.48 B: well it's a it's a good cultural thing too ah 

388.29 389.81 A: right yeah yeah 

389.20 398.51 B: i- it's funny my wife and i we were talking earlier of course i enjoyed we lived in new york where sp- you know y- y- you say new york down here everybody thinks new york city of 

397.87 399.34 A: right right yeah 

398.65 411.30 B: course up there it's nothing like that it's upstate new york of course you know it's entirely different but the only thing that bothered me up there is it was the taxes and the cold i i just couldn't deal with it of course i'm a native tennessean 

400.22 401.44 A: mhm 

406.91 408.89 A: (( [mn] right )) 

409.08 410.82 A: yeah 

410.97 412.40 A: (( right )) 

411.79 419.87 B: and i just can't deal with having you know five months out of the year [mn] you can't see the ground [laughter] i i don't know if scranton gets that bad 

413.27 415.09 A: (( [mn] right )) 

415.87 418.24 A: [laughter] 

419.23 423.54 A: oh it's the same thing yeah lots of snow lots of rain 

421.04 422.69 B: (( but ah )) 

423.52 430.40 B: it just gets once you get away from that if you ever live in a place where it doesn't do it you'll s- you'll see the difference 

429.73 432.02 A: right yeah yeah i bet 

431.38 438.90 B: it's much freer to go out and get in your car and go places we have a lot of dampness down here in the winter but noth- nothing like upstate new york 

435.73 436.87 A: mhm 

438.91 439.47 A: (( [mn] )) 

439.32 441.93 B: not not so far as the weather's concerned 

441.39 443.88 A: right yeah i would imagine [mn] 

444.47 446.92 B: (( mm [lipsmack] but ah mhm )) 

445.54 450.35 A: but ah yeah [mn] so i- it's kind of funny that it's the topic's pets now because ah 

450.45 454.43 A: my girlfriend and i are talking about moving in together after college 

454.65 458.13 A: and ah we're fighting about what kind of pets we want [laughter] 

457.89 459.31 B: well that is odd 

458.90 463.24 A: yeah so ah she she's wanting the ah jack russell terrier 

463.25 467.06 A: and i'm wanting the siamese cats so [laughter] [mn] 

466.58 473.35 B: well i'll tell you about the terrier as a matter of fact ah our human resources man raises ah he breeds ter- ah the jack russells 

472.68 474.00 A: mhm 

473.80 476.07 B: they're a high strung dog 

475.33 476.81 A: (( mm mhm )) 

476.19 478.32 B: ah basically and if they 

478.57 481.47 B: they say that make good pets they're small 

481.21 482.41 A: mhm 

481.59 483.95 B: but they have a tendency to ah 

484.14 485.29 B: kind of rule 

485.78 494.35 B: and if there's a i don't know if it's inbred into 'em or what if there's a hole like say they can get in between covers or something they dive for a hole 

486.02 486.69 A: (( mm )) 

494.19 494.91 A: (( hm )) 

494.59 496.14 B: it's odd it's ah 

496.23 504.66 B: or if they see like like if you're sitting on a couch and you know how you got the the different cushions and there's a partition between 'em they go for that that partition 

500.87 501.80 A: mhm 

504.86 512.46 B: it's funny it's ah to hear him talk about how these how these little dogs are but ah they're in big demand they're in big demand here 

509.20 510.55 A: (( hm yeah that's odd )) 

510.94 511.81 A: what's that 

512.55 513.67 A: (( hm )) 

513.33 514.46 B: they really are 

514.51 517.73 B: siamese [noise] i had a siamese cat many many years ago 

517.53 526.70 A: yeah yeah that's the kind of cat my my mom likes the most and ah the kind we i i grew up with [mn] you know we had we had two or three siamese cats at a time so 

519.53 520.89 B: [noise] [noise] 

523.08 524.44 B: [noise] we ah 

526.28 529.32 B: we had one we called him chocolate tail 

528.96 529.74 A: (( ahah mhm )) 

529.57 540.71 B: and ah we kept that cat for oh gosh i don't know how many years and he was just [mn] he was tops he was just ah he was a wonderful cat clean w- good disposition

546.54 549.46 B: and he he done extremely well with us 

549.82 555.20 B: matter of fact i believe that cat lived to be about if i'm guessing about nineteen years old 

554.50 557.11 A: [mn] yeah yeah that's about how long ours went 

556.52 559.97 B: they have a longevity that's just it's unparalleled 

558.25 559.47 A: right 

559.73 561.35 A: right yeah
