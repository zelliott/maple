440.82 442.01 B: [laughter] 

441.29 446.26 A: then they'd have like a bunch of kittens we get stuck with a whole bunch of cats

459.07 461.25 B: [laughter] nobody wanted them 

461.31 468.14 B: so after like the second cat we actually figured out that there was a way to help [noise] the cat not have any more cats 

467.53 468.52 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

468.45 473.85 B: so we figured out where the humane society was and they did it for free for 

474.02 475.53 B: us [noise] had we known 

476.09 480.97 B: dude that would've helped us get rid of like sixteen cats 

481.50 482.20 A: (( [mn] yeah [mn] [mn] )) 

481.71 484.69 B: we would even put um ads 

482.82 488.81 A: (( um )) 

485.05 489.02 B: in the paper to get rid of these cats and they were gorgeous little cats 

489.27 498.41 B: long hair in fact once we placed one just around the corner with a family it was the most beautiful cat in the whole neighbourhood 

499.12 502.85 B: so beautiful i was actually sad that we'd given that one away 

503.45 513.93 B: but the darn thing would get on top of the fridge when it was really little i mean the size of my hand and it would jump from the fridge straight to the table when we all eating 

514.08 517.30 B: and make a whole mess 'cause he would land anywhere 

517.42 523.04 B: [laughter] but when that thing was hungry he one day my dad was cooking with 

523.16 536.21 B: he was wearing his shorts it was a summer day and the cat climbed up his leg up to his shoulder [laughter] 'cause my dad was preparing some meat and the cat smelled it it really wanted to have some 

536.70 538.13 B: so i guess it was uh 

538.48 542.08 B: that cat had a bad temper so i'm glad we actually got rid of it 

543.09 545.35 B: were your pets ever mean to you 

546.64 548.97 A: no not really 

549.55 555.08 A: although sometimes the iguana would flip out and try to attack me but [laughter] other than that 

556.40 559.64 B: how friendly are iguanas what kind of things do you do with them 

559.64 564.80 A: uh well i mean they're not much for like petting them and stuff but you can i don't know
