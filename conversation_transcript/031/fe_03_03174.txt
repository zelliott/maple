270.18 275.47 B: and i was all worried about 'em and everything forget it so it had her fixed so she wouldn't do that anymore 

276.03 282.43 B: but she was just like she she left my yard and went roaming and ends up knocked up 

282.89 289.18 A: yeah [laughter] that's what happened like well when i grew up okay we used to have a little boy cat and we had to get rid of him 

289.22 291.08 A: because she kept getting pregnant 

290.67 291.89 B: (( [laughter] )) 

291.30 293.28 A: like every time she'd have a litter 

293.35 296.06 A: a couple of months later she'll have another litter 

295.45 296.52 B: (( uh-huh )) 

296.10 303.50 A: and i'm like okay come on now my mom was like we have to get rid of the boy cat because she keeps getting pregnant so she's just had this last litter 

300.26 301.39 B: mhm 

303.87 306.10 A: and we're like okay that's it [laughter] 

306.61 311.03 B: are they in the ho- is are all the cats in the house all the time or in and out 

309.60 311.78 A: yeah they stay in the house 

311.93 317.37 A: like the girl she doesn't like it outside but like the boy cat we used to have he used to love to outside 

316.73 318.83 B: probably went prowling all the time 

318.10 319.93 A: yeah all the time 

319.45 320.06 B: [laughter] 

323.02 327.53 A: every time we opened the door he would just run out when we tried to catch him like no don't go 

327.02 329.50 B: mhm yeah but did they listen to you though 

329.76 335.97 A: the girl well i don't i guess because they're cats it becomes their own little personality 

333.34 334.31 B: mhm 

335.15 336.29 B: uh-huh 

336.17 345.48 A: and th- they're not like dogs like dogs you say no and they listen to you you know cats you say no and they like wag their tail at you like whatever i'm gonna do what i want to do anyway 

339.83 340.90 B: i know 

345.03 351.85 B: that's probably why i never had a cat because you can't like make 'em you can't make 'em do anything they just look at you like what the hell 

349.41 350.51 A: yeah 

351.73 352.65 A: (( you ))

356.77 364.73 A: my cat actually tries to go in the trash can and i'll say no then i'll go back in the kitchen a minutes later and she'll be right in the trash can again and i'm like okay stop no 

363.79 364.49 B: [laughter] 

366.46 369.37 B: i think that's probably one more reason why i didn't have any 

369.35 370.30 A: (( yeah )) 

369.43 371.85 B: cats around here just 

371.57 377.87 A: i'm saying to my mom the other day like come on mom let's get a dog and she was like no i don't want a dog back there crapping in my back yard 

377.25 378.75 B: [laughter] 

378.85 380.44 A: so like okay 

380.72 387.21 A: because we used to have one but my brother he would never clean up after her and stuff like after she lived out the back and stuff

479.55 489.49 B: and ah my dog used to be outside all the time and i moved to a nicer place and she could be inside now and she's i'm sure that's why she got lazy and fat and
