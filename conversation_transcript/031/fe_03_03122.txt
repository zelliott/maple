60.47 62.45 B: she loved to ride in the car

72.94 73.98 A: right 

75.38 80.11 A: well i don't have any children so he's so monty is like my child that's for sure 

79.71 86.70 B: yes and you get so attached to 'em it- it's just devastating if anything happened if they get sick or anything 

81.73 82.72 A: well 

86.37 97.13 A: yes it is i ah grew up with about five basset hounds at a time and ah well my parents bred them and it just it ripped your heart out first of all when you had to let the puppies go 

90.83 92.78 B: oh 

96.72 98.30 B: (( yes )) 

97.51 103.63 A: but then you know with so many dogs of course they're they're going to die and it just rips your heart out every time 

104.09 106.04 B: my ah sister in law 

106.39 112.21 B: raises dogs and the last one she had she said that she 

112.26 118.60 B: had to get rid of it she delivered it to her uncle out of state because her son was getting too attached to it 

118.63 121.27 A: oh [laughter] 

121.43 123.45 A: yeah [laughter] 

122.08 126.00 B: [laughter] and she said she didn't think that was going to be a good idea [laughter] 

125.30 131.27 A: no probably not [laughter] so do you think you'll ah ever have a pet again or 

127.76 128.85 B: so 

130.58 137.59 B: [lipsmack] [mn] yeah i'm just not sure if i'll get another miniature dachshund because they do require a lot of time 

137.60 151.02 A: yeah i feel the same way about my beagle um well not just that but i have this habit of telling him he's the best beagle in the whole world and i'm just not sure i could ever do that again with another beagle [laughter] i'd have to get a different breed [laughter] 

149.57 154.84 B: yeah yeah she she was just a lot of trouble like i say she 

155.20 157.51 B: and you know they're so small that 

156.98 160.66 A: i they're tiny well she must have been what about three pounds 

160.42 163.93 B: no she was more than that she was overweight [laughter] 

161.55 162.55 A: oh she was 

162.64 164.66 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

164.88 170.79 B: unfortunately and that was my fault because what i did was i fed her everything i ate 

170.44 171.48 A: right 

170.96 172.95 B: she ate popcorn and everything 

172.75 174.76 A: yeah so does mine [laughter] 

173.87 185.84 B: and then when the doctor said now you gotta stop this it was tough and i did more so than everybody else 'cause everybody else was used to feeding her and i'm keep saying look she can't have that she can't have that [laughter] 

185.12 186.82 A: i know and then you're the bad guy 

186.56 188.08 B: mhm mhm 

187.42 189.15 A: i know yeah 

188.69 189.65 B: yes 

189.71 193.78 B: she even at one time my daughter had a hamburger and she was 

193.85 197.37 B: eating it and she left it on the table and she got up for something 

197.50 201.98 B: and this dog was so fast she jumped up on her chair grabbed that hamburger 

202.13 205.84 B: and ran into the bedroom under the bed with it and ate it 

204.67 210.08 A: that's impressive for a little dog [laughter] 

207.95 210.91 B: i could not believe she did that 

211.27 212.40 B: you know 

211.28 213.18 A: wow [laughter] [laughter] 

212.65 214.78 B: and my daughter was just like 

215.13 219.49 B: did you see what she did [laughter] she got my hamburger 

219.02 223.04 A: and you're just too impressed to be mad [laughter] 

220.87 226.75 B: [laughter] and when when we'd leave her alone she'd get very upset 

226.67 232.78 A: yeah ours monty does that too as a matter of fact i have to work from home for that very reason he just can't handle 

232.73 234.93 B: oh well you're lucky you can work from home 

234.20 247.96 A: i'm very lucky i'm very lucky but ah it was that was a decision when i was in law school i'd been planning on you know ah actually working for a district attorney's office and then that just ah it became clear he was a puppy then and it became clear that that wasn't going to happen 

247.53 250.13 B: [laughter] 

247.96 257.99 A: [laughter] because he just would just howl non stop while i was gone and it just and we took it a behaviorist we took him to the vet we did everything 

258.06 263.20 A: and he was just one of those cases that he just wasn't going to get any better so 

262.95 266.35 B: oh my mother has a chihuahua and 

266.50 269.25 B: every time she gets on the phone she starts barking 

269.54 274.19 A: [noise] yeah some dogs are just funny they just have you know a one little quirk [laughter] 

274.12 279.71 B: well i know it's because you know she's there with her all day long alone and everything so you know it's 

276.90 277.73 A: yeah 

281.14 289.02 B: it's just that you know she's jealous [laughter] it's okay this is my time nobody's supposed to get in on it 

283.51 285.41 A: yeah [laughter] 

288.61 290.37 A: that's right [laughter] [laughter] 

290.07 291.57 B: yeah so 

291.63 294.86 B: she she does some funny things and she'd be lost without her 

295.18 301.13 B: but um she won't let her go outside by herself although she has a fenced yard [laughter] 

302.23 304.00 B: so she's 

302.26 303.47 A: (( oh )) 

304.17 306.20 B: she's pretty protective of her too 

306.19 307.64 A: (( yeah i'll bet )) 

307.50 308.57 B: and 

308.94 315.58 B: if she thinks you know if you lean over to hug her or something the dog just gets so upset i guess she thinks you're going to hurt her 

315.31 317.49 A: wow that is protective 

317.30 318.85 B: yeah so 

318.01 323.60 A: again another small dog pretending it's a rottweiler [laughter] [laughter] 

319.94 322.31 B: i know isn't that funny 

322.90 326.13 B: isn't that funny that they do that 

325.27 326.84 A: yeah [laughter] 

326.41 331.35 B: you know i hadn't thought about that but now that you mention it yeah more and more 

330.97 332.43 A: [laughter] 

332.39 336.27 B: [laughter] yeah so [lipsmack] mm 

336.40 339.69 A: i'd say i'd be lost without a dog now i don't know 

338.83 340.80 B: yeah they are a lot of company 

340.69 349.87 A: they are they are and i think just because i'd had you know i don't remember not having a dog because my parents got their first basset when i was a year old so 

349.20 350.41 B: yeah 

350.04 351.94 A: i've just always been around them 

352.02 355.15 A: so well we had cats too when i was young but 

353.88 354.66 B: oh 

354.81 356.09 B: do you have cats now 

356.08 360.02 A: no no cats now monty is very much an only [laughter] 

359.48 361.06 B: [laughter] 

360.42 370.47 A: he well we have there are homeless cats that live in our driveway but ah and and we feed them and monty tolerates that [laughter] but that's as far as it goes 

363.91 364.97 B: yeah 

370.28 371.45 B: [laughter] 

370.56 372.64 A: so [laughter] 

372.40 373.37 B: wow 

373.18 374.28 A: (( but ah )) 

374.32 377.86 A: yeah he tolerates the squirrels although he does chase them 

378.27 386.26 A: up the up the trees in the back yard and [lipsmack] yeah you know i think he feels he has chores he has certain chores and 

385.32 386.45 B: [laughter] 

386.12 397.98 A: keeping the yard free of of squirrels and even though i feed the birds he likes to chase the you know the birds if there gets to be too many and yes you know dog chores barking at the mailman that sort of thing 

392.86 393.95 B: yeah 

396.76 397.78 B: yeah 

398.73 407.23 B: oh she was she was so funny because she'd go out in the back yard and play with the squirrels and when she would we had two trees that were fairly close together 

407.46 408.89 B: and 

408.92 413.11 B: she they'd run down the tree and run to the other tree and her right behind them 

412.94 414.03 A: wow 

414.03 418.19 B: and she was just barking the whole time you know and 

416.88 418.04 A: [laughter] 

418.26 420.39 A: tail probably going like mad 

420.26 430.56 B: yeah and i thought you know they're just playing with her they know that she can never get down [laughter] so it was extremely funny you know just to watch her 

424.91 426.09 A: [laughter] 

430.78 434.80 B: and then i thought what is she going to do if she catches one [laughter] 

433.81 438.25 A: [laughter] i'll bet she had no idea [laughter] 

437.67 441.82 B: [mn] no and they would get up the tree and just look down at her 

441.50 444.14 A: and laugh [laughter] 

442.21 443.21 B: yeah 

443.37 451.73 B: that's exactly what it looked like and it would happen so much you know i could just stand and watch her from the window [mn] 'cause it was just so funny 

444.70 446.62 A: [laughter] 

452.03 453.34 A: yes [laughter] 

453.25 454.37 B: (( so ))

460.07 461.43 B: yes [mn] 

460.61 465.27 A: ah but i guess we're supposed to talk about how much time we spend we spend taking care

480.51 483.26 A: well i figure it's good for me so [laughter] 

482.60 488.29 B: well that that was my excuse 'cause i didn't want to walk alone but boy you know you've got a dog everything's okay [laughter] 

487.45 496.22 A: everything's okay although i'll tell you during this past winter when you know we had blizzard after blizzard five fifteen was not fun trudging through snow [laughter] 

495.61 497.16 B: ooh 

496.48 503.74 A: but he loved it so we we do it and it is good exercise and it's good to get out there especially if you can come home to a nice hot cup of coffee 

503.98 508.59 B: yeah oh yeah i hadn't thought about that [laughter] 

504.21 505.11 A: but
