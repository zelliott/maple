6.66 7.70 B: hi 

8.27 10.82 B: um so our topic is pets 

10.26 13.61 A: i thought it was health but it seems that shifted in mid gear 

13.52 17.23 B: (( oh really [laughter] the health of our pets )) 

14.24 16.16 A: yeah okay it's pets 

17.00 18.16 A: okay 

17.97 22.42 B: [laughter] um so do you have a pet 

22.28 23.38 A: no 

23.42 24.26 B: oh 

23.97 24.84 A: do you 

24.85 26.18 B: i do 

25.95 27.11 A: what kind of pet 

27.15 35.13 B: i have a cat and now i have a dog as of a few days ago [laughter] 

33.69 36.15 A: and how does that mix work in your home 

36.74 40.61 B: um well these two know each other already 

40.66 44.58 B: i just adopted my aunt's thirteen year old lab [laughter] 

45.45 49.72 B: and ah so it works they don't really pay much attention to each other 

49.63 61.01 A: okay well that always works in a home my ah children are clamoring for a pet but i keep telling them when we live on a farm they can have whatever they want so then i have i have as much wildlife as i can handle 

50.70 51.78 B: [laughter] 

57.86 59.18 B: [laughter] 

61.23 62.63 B: oh really 

62.04 64.37 A: though i have to feed them 

64.19 65.85 B: [laughter] 

65.19 67.49 A: you know take them out for walks so 

67.05 68.65 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

67.76 69.44 A: children instead of pets 

69.76 70.49 A: um 

69.91 75.11 B: when i was um when i was very little i had hamsters because my mother thought that that was 

75.20 76.64 B: it was good as a pet 

76.76 81.09 B: but with low maintenance and she didn't have to do a lot of work [laughter] 

80.09 85.99 A: okay i i would tend to goldfish but so how important are your pets in your life 

83.25 84.30 B: oh yeah 

86.62 87.57 B: um 

87.64 90.22 B: well you know they're very important to me 

90.97 98.17 B: i've flown them across the country twice when i've moved [laughter] so [laughter] i refuse to leave them behind 

95.35 96.22 A: okay 

97.89 105.77 A: oh i understand that i have friends who have pets and one of them you know lost their cat and was mourning their death terribly it was like losing a family member 

105.66 106.36 B: (( mhm )) 

106.17 109.07 A: and i i understand um 

108.44 115.03 B: yeah it seems silly to me sometimes but it's amazing how quickly you get attached to them and how strongly how strong the bond is you know 

114.88 121.98 A: oh i i heard an explanation once about um the psychology of love that i think holds true here 

121.97 128.04 A: and it it was a whole explanation on it's all tied to um the more that you do for somebody 

128.04 137.27 A: the more investment you have i mean the more feeling you have and i would tend to bet that that holds for your pet too 'cause here yo- you are giving in for so much of their care 

128.18 128.96 B: mhm 

137.13 138.27 B: mhm 

137.65 138.49 A: that 

138.51 145.61 A: it's now a part of you is invested in that pet and therefore your feelings are increased above and beyond what they would be for this 

145.93 150.88 A: otherwise you know creature i don't know if this makes sense but it's a theory 

148.38 149.19 B: yeah 

150.18 154.54 B: it does that's really interesting actually huh 

154.43 156.72 A: (( [laughter] it )) 

155.98 159.00 B: that really is it's really interesting it also explains um 

159.57 162.40 B: also explains i guess a little bit of parental love too 

162.80 171.34 A: explains a lot of parental love and it was it was explained to me actually as a method of increasing spousal love that you know take your 

164.64 165.96 B: mhm 

171.26 181.95 A: ego out of it and do more give more because the more you give the more invested you are and the more you i- i- it doesn't really you know you have to sit there and adjust it for a couple of minutes 

181.99 187.17 A: but in practice it sort of works again if we have to stick to the topic of pets 

187.03 200.60 A: i would say that along with th- the whole package of affection you know without any string you know no strings attached and all the classic um reasons for having a pet i would sense that that factors in there somewhere too but 

187.07 188.22 B: [laughter] 

193.51 194.34 B: yeah 

197.36 198.46 B: mhm 

200.57 201.77 B: yeah it is 

201.26 202.10 A: um 

202.04 203.81 B: there's also something about 

204.39 209.24 B: well i guess this is related but something about someone or some creature needing you 

209.68 211.20 A: a hundred percent 

211.12 212.68 B: you know it's just 

211.81 215.55 A: we all have a need to be needed and a pet would feed it right into that 

214.97 216.89 B: yeah yeah 

216.00 218.08 A: (( that's why some of them are so cute )) 

218.20 221.50 B: [laughter] i'm actually um 

222.09 227.57 B: a dog walker and a pet sitter that's what i do right now for a living [laughter] 

225.90 228.75 A: okay so you staged this phone call 

228.68 229.86 B: i'm sorry 

229.15 231.07 A: you staged this phone call 

230.39 232.76 B: i staged the phone call [laughter] 

231.71 235.83 A: you picked the topic why else would we be talking about our pets 

233.14 239.64 B: [laughter] i wish it was funny when they announced the topic i said ah ha 

239.45 252.98 A: the closest that we get to pets right now is i live in a city and we have a cat problem they're more pests than anything else there's somebody who feeds them in my neighborhood and some of them are feral and i wish they would stop because it's just not fair to them 

253.03 265.96 B: yeah you know it's kind of a catch twenty two for people who are trying to help feral cats where they think well we'll feed them keep them from starving but then they keep them coming back yeah yeah it's not good i mean 

261.33 264.11 A: and they reproduce they just have more of them 

264.12 264.87 A: so 

266.09 273.48 B: the best thing they could do is actually contact their shelter have them caught and spayed [laughter] and or neutered 

271.29 273.09 A: but we contacted a shelter 

273.27 279.43 A: we did and they i mean i found a cat in my kitchen last week my three year old left the screen door open and i almost freaked 

273.67 274.45 B: really 

278.33 279.29 B: oh my god 

279.86 284.17 A: but um the we contacted them and they told us we had to go 

284.28 286.17 A: um catch 'em 

286.36 287.04 B: (( hm )) 

286.44 290.46 A: (( i have plenty to do besides go hunting wild life on my back deck )) 

290.34 292.09 B: they told you that you had to catch 

291.55 292.68 A: yeah 

292.87 297.50 A: yes they wouldn't come down they they we had to do it then they would come and remove it 

293.14 293.79 B: (( them ))

328.10 330.30 B: iguana iguana's are fun actually 

330.44 333.04 A: yeah but everything needs to be cleaned up after

358.55 360.79 A: no he's cutting everything 

360.75 362.66 B: why does he want to do that 

361.95 365.80 A: because new york state is new york city is in the biggest um 

366.03 369.09 A: the um economic crisis it's been in since 

369.17 370.66 A: oh twenty years ago

400.85 403.46 B: i actually don't know [laughter] 

402.84 411.16 A: um i don't think it comes anywhere near these overpaid sanitation workers or you know there there's a lot of there's a lot of pork in the city 

411.08 419.22 B: yeah that certainly would be less expensive than something like a new football stadium or a baseball stadium or something like that
