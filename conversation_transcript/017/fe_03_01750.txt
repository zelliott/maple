176.69 177.50 A: um 

177.59 182.30 A: i'm not f- i'm not quite sure what you're saying i didn't what about them 

181.25 182.10 B: (( [mn] like )) 

182.42 186.34 B: with the nuclear arms that they might be having and developing 

186.67 188.31 A: oh i didn't even know that 

188.99 190.28 A: (( [laughter] )) 

189.51 191.02 B: (( okay [laughter] ))

194.85 196.13 B: (( oh yeah )) 

196.91 197.53 B: (( ye )) 

197.71 205.36 B: yeah it actually came out around the time of with what we were deciding to do with iraq um north korea stepped forward and and they kept putting in you 

205.36 219.23 B: know all these notices about their nuclear weapons and they're developing and they're testing them and i mean i was really surprised i didn't understand first of all they would be so vocal about it i mean you know at least iraq has the common sense to try and cover it up 

218.87 220.01 A: (( [laughter] yeah [mn] )) 

219.38 220.44 B: (( but ah )) 

221.54 222.38 B: (( so )) 

222.49 223.29 B: (( that was )) 

223.53 227.07 B: kinda scary to hear what they were up to mhm 

226.47 235.15 A: i think the scariest part is what we don't know what the media and what you know what the president you know doesn't tell us that's the scariest part for me 

231.92 232.75 B: right 

233.24 234.04 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

234.94 237.56 B: that is isn't it [noise] yeah 

236.53 242.59 A: because i think w- we and i think they withhold a lot of information from us because if we knew everything i mean 

240.14 241.23 B: (( mhm )) 

241.85 243.15 B: exactly 

242.88 245.39 A: we'd all be [laughter] more really scared 

244.34 248.38 B: [laughter] right yeah absolutely [noise] 

245.68 246.74 A: [laughter] 

248.20 250.69 A: i also think saddam is still alive 

250.75 252.13 B: oh yeah 

250.92 251.90 A: i just 

251.91 257.82 A: that's pretty scary too because who knows when he's gonna just you know pop back up and what he's gonna do 

256.56 257.15 B: (( mhm )) 

257.46 259.46 B: (( mhm yep )) 

258.53 270.65 A: it just seems [mn] like he never goes away [laughter] [laughter] i i'm i'm so scared i think he's really alive i mean they would've found a body [noise] they would have found some [noise] sort of you know more evidence saying he was dead 

260.99 262.99 B: right i know 

265.16 266.14 B: yeah 

268.39 269.14 B: yeah 

270.58 274.83 B: yeah i agree with that that's a lot easier to prove they would have been 

270.66 271.66 A: that how [noise] [noise] [noise] 

275.31 278.95 B: touting that all over had they found that [lipsmack] oh wow 

279.00 281.49 B: [noise] yeah there is a good chance he is alive [noise] 

281.86 286.90 B: like whoever harboring him they're definitely a threat no question whatever country it is [noise] 

287.24 290.64 B: you know there was even a report that maybe he went to russia or something 

290.66 293.88 A: is that what you heard s- that he might've went to russia 

292.68 293.50 B: they were 

293.68 299.36 B: yeah there were rumors that maybe russia granted him asylum he sneaked in there or syria um 

300.53 310.51 A: [mn] do you think that ah he when he does surface if he does um that he will try and get back in power or do anything or do you think he's just gonna stay out of [laughter] everything for a while 

310.18 311.58 B: (( yeah i )) 

311.89 319.52 B: [mn] you know it sounds like he's the kind he'll just do whatever it takes to i mean he he's so beyond evil that 

318.45 320.58 A: mhm you know i agree with that 

321.60 331.19 B: oh but i i i'm proud of what we did i'm really really proud because i think it's just horrific the things that he did and oh my goodness you know 

331.25 336.36 A: [noise] [noise] a lot of people i've talked to were against the war but i i agree with it i mean we had to do something 

336.14 337.96 B: (( right right )) 

336.50 346.68 A: [noise] i mean who knows when he would have used any weapons against us he's he's not the person you want having something like that [laughter] that's really i don't know i'm glad that we went in there 

339.83 340.93 B: exactly 

343.06 344.29 B: (( no no )) 

344.57 345.61 B: (( [noise] )) 

346.33 347.78 B: (( [noise] yes me too )) 

346.77 350.88 A: i mean it's a shame you know people you know our people died and everything but [noise] 

350.21 351.48 B: right 

351.17 353.98 A: i wish it didn't have to be like that but that's war 

352.94 353.85 B: right 

354.64 356.22 B: (( i agree with you hundred per )) 

356.43 361.67 A: [sigh] i feel a little bit safer knowing you know that we stepped in and did something before it was too late 

360.24 362.63 B: (( cent mhm yeah )) 

362.01 368.87 A: because we were completely unaware there'd be terrorist attacks you know i'm glad we just got in and did something before you know 

362.70 363.45 B: (( exactly )) 

364.77 366.19 B: right right right 

368.31 370.26 B: right i agree 

369.02 370.50 A: something else happened [mn] 

370.28 372.83 B: yep absolutely 

372.36 378.81 A: but i still think they're a danger i just don't think not near as much i mean they don't have quite as much power as they did before 

378.50 390.36 B: right yeah it's hard to imagine they would i mean even after the gulf war and th- you know those other strikes that followed years later i'm thinking how how did they have have anything after all that and there's su- supposedly sanctions and 

378.88 379.44 A: (( [noise] )) 

391.11 395.33 B: phew you know he had some good ties somewhere to be able to get anything 

396.21 397.69 B: to sneak things in 

398.13 402.57 A: i always wondered how he got hold of all that and i don't know 

400.68 401.72 B: (( yeah )) 

402.61 406.53 A: so did we find everything and remove it i mean 

407.07 408.76 B: (( no um you know that's the thing i )) 

408.81 423.51 B: think that there'd been there'd definitely been reports and things but nothing like absolutely here here are the items but now the u._n. they said today wanted to go in there they especially to get back you know get involved and do their inspections and um 

424.75 426.42 B: so they're [mn] i 

426.65 432.39 B: i mean i believe that there's definitely things there i i really do believe that [noise] [noise] 

430.78 435.93 A: [noise] they did find some re- really weird things i guess they found a painting of ah [lipsmack] 

436.11 444.37 A: i don't know where it was it was somewhere there um in one of his saddam's hideouts or something and ah it was a painting of ah nine eleven 

444.33 445.14 B: (( ah [cough] )) 

444.65 449.53 A: and they don't know if it was after it happened or if they had done that before 

448.82 450.14 B: (( mhm )) 

449.51 460.53 A: it showed um you know the plane crashing into what looked like in the painting would have been you know the twin towers and it had our soldiers crying and and walking with their heads down 

456.53 457.18 B: (( right )) 

460.74 463.79 A: so that was kinda weird that really freaked me out 

461.21 461.81 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

462.37 463.10 B: (( oh )) 

463.66 466.14 B: (( i didn't hear anything about that that's [mn] mhm [noise] )) 

464.59 477.40 A: um i heard it on a radio station and there was a website ah they gave um saying to go to a certain ah news station a ah on a website um from a news station and they they had a picture of it there 

477.26 478.36 B: (( oh )) 

478.71 479.91 B: (( [noise] )) 

478.71 489.72 A: so that was really sad to hear cause they they couldn't figure out if it was you know done recently or you know whether it was before or after but still just to have a painting of that 

481.62 482.50 B: (( absolutely )) 

485.87 487.03 B: (( mhm )) 

489.42 490.98 B: (( ah oh ))

505.37 506.61 B: (( one way or another [noise] )) 

507.16 513.97 A: my i mean what i always wondered is how does he keep getting back in power there i mean a lot of them don't like him 

511.78 512.75 B: (( yeah )) 

513.92 515.49 B: (( [noise] right right )) 

514.29 520.49 A: and they want to break free from all that but yet he keeps you know getting back in office and i don't understand [laughter]

535.23 545.83 A: [noise] i heard [laughter] i i heard it i didn't know if it was a joke or not but i heard everybody voted for him it's like what is he doing to threaten and everybody would vote for him [mn] that's just crazy 

537.44 538.17 B: [laughter] 

538.39 539.27 B: yeah

571.39 580.91 A: [noise] i guess i don't fear the other countries as much i'm just i'm just just unsettled you know knowing that saddam is still i i pretty much know myself that he's out there 

578.57 579.36 B: (( right right )) 

580.54 582.40 B: yeah i believe it 

580.94 587.98 A: and like you said before he's not the type of person that you know he wants to d- do something he's not gonna just stay quiet and
