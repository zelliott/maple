8.90 10.80 A: same here so 

9.89 12.28 B: oh okay so we're both beginners 

11.92 13.79 A: we'll be learning together here 

13.47 14.69 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

14.08 16.78 A: what are we supposed to be talking about education um 

16.38 18.86 B: computers in the school system 

17.01 17.68 A: (( com- )) 

19.77 20.99 B: and whether they 

21.83 24.34 B: are a good or a bad thing i guess [laughter] are 

25.10 26.31 B: you still there 

25.97 32.52 A: i'm sorry i don't know what happened it just it disappeared for a minute [laughter] 

26.57 27.41 B: oh 

30.27 31.61 B: oh that's okay 

32.82 35.49 A: so what do you think as far as computers do you think it 

36.05 37.24 B: um 

37.76 39.69 B: well um 

40.21 53.15 B: i have a love hate relationship with my computer [laughter] and my husband's computer put it that way but um i think they can be a very good source of information but i know they can also be used 

42.48 44.04 A: [laughter] 

46.73 47.74 A: right 

53.92 56.81 B: um in unproductive ways [laughter] 

56.18 66.24 A: absolutely um i've got some experience with my daughter using um educational programmes in themselves whereas she would learn um a lot quicker 

57.40 58.15 B: (( um )) 

66.36 69.33 A: by playing a game or um 

69.83 79.50 A: it it maybe the the way the programme was presenting it or whatever but a lot of times um in that sense you know being an educational programme she's learned a lot quicker 

79.36 80.32 B: yeah 

79.62 80.67 A: um 

80.90 85.35 A: other places in education the only thing i can really see is maybe um 

86.09 87.22 A: oh 

87.27 92.10 A: a glorified typewriter to be honest with you [laughter] i mean that's really 

89.56 91.36 B: yeah [laughter] 

92.25 93.73 A: all i could really 

94.48 96.08 A: relate to anyway 

95.80 100.22 B: yeah um my my husband works in computers and he is just 

100.53 103.57 B: everywhere he goes it you know 

103.93 105.14 A: the obsession 

104.77 108.37 B: yes his that is his thing he does computers and it 

108.41 109.38 B: it 

110.10 118.71 B: [sigh] i guess my if you're using it for information and stuff that's great but if you're just going to be playing computer games on it [laughter] for hours on end 

116.63 122.79 A: right that takes away from the family and it takes away from your your life as a person you know what i mean 

121.81 124.24 B: right right and i think 

124.53 129.59 B: i don't know if there's a way to instill that in children who are young [laughter] but 

127.97 136.41 A: [laughter] right well i think it's you know almost on the same lines of as a t._v. it can be used for good there's times for it to be on and there's times for it to be off 

132.15 133.14 B: yeah 

135.94 137.04 B: right 

137.56 139.79 B: i definitely agree with that [laughter] 

137.58 138.53 A: um 

139.15 154.12 A: i've got some hymn school friends that have um their curriculum all a hundred per cent computer based and it's a help in a way that it's all self directed um these kids can actually learn things on their own i mean of course there's adult you know interaction too 

144.72 145.58 B: uh-huh 

153.79 154.70 B: uh-huh 

154.16 157.39 A: but um it grades everything it does everything for you 

157.53 160.76 A: and they're learning a lot more as opposed to looking at a text book 

160.46 161.80 B: yeah 

161.22 162.97 A: um the visual 

163.04 166.01 A: in your face instead of i guess reading a text book it 

166.01 167.63 B: yeah i know 

166.61 170.08 A: helps and it's not just games it's reading and answering questions you know what i mean 

169.67 181.42 B: yeah different people learn in different ways i mean some people are much better like my mother in law you can't just like sit her down with like a v._c._r. and tell her how to work it she has to read the whole manual 

170.21 171.03 A: but 

172.12 173.15 A: right 

181.21 182.76 A: [laughter] right [laughter] 

181.83 189.95 B: me i'm just like oh i can figure it out all by myself [laughter] it's like if i run into a problem i'll look at the manual i'm very much more of a hands on type 

190.19 192.30 B: learner and so 

192.67 194.29 B: sometimes that can be 

194.53 195.19 B: (( um )) 

195.23 197.25 B: i mean i guess you could use you can 

198.01 201.14 B: apply both of those with the computer but 

201.56 202.59 B: (( i don't know )) 

202.10 213.14 A: [laughter] [laughter] i can definitely understand the the obsession problem with them i've got a cousin who has her husband's in the same thing you know he works twenty four seven on computers he'll come home 

202.96 204.26 B: [laughter] 

209.51 210.42 B: mhm 

211.78 212.60 B: yeah 

213.21 214.85 A: from work and then and 

215.48 221.87 A: there's a computer [laughter] and it it will keep him away from helping with the kids or 

216.73 218.04 B: [laughter] 

221.96 227.37 A: interacting with other activities that he should be involved in or whatever but 

226.95 228.03 B: yeah 

227.44 229.48 A: i can definitely see the downfall in that 

229.95 232.47 B: [laughter] yeah but ah 

231.11 232.51 A: [noise] as far as 

232.71 234.53 A: education goes um 

234.74 236.35 A: i'm not really sure i mean 

236.46 238.23 A: like you said it depends on 

236.63 237.41 B: yeah 

238.57 246.56 A: it depends on their learning capabilities and their ability to not want to just learn that i guess that certain way all the time 

246.44 247.79 B: yeah 

247.13 250.25 A: 'cause there's things that you can do not on a computer [laughter] 

249.49 250.44 B: right 

250.74 254.97 B: well i think i mean we're definitely in the computer age 

254.57 255.60 A: right 

254.77 260.48 B: um right now and i guess things like learning computer programming and different 

260.26 272.71 B: you know code based prog- programmes is a good thing but i mean they're things that we have to learn to do the old fashioned way you know like writing letters and you know 

271.21 273.60 A: right exactly 

272.90 275.49 B: handwriting things instead of just typing 

275.87 277.07 B: (( it's ah )) 

277.33 278.58 B: there's a lot of 

278.75 281.10 B: i mean i know myself i'm 

281.68 282.61 B: ah 

282.70 288.84 B: i can accuse myself of that i'd much rather type an email to someone than having to write that letter and send it through the mail or something 

290.05 291.30 B: (( and )) 

290.14 293.19 A: what's sad is i even procrastinate on that [laughter] 

292.43 294.04 B: [laughter] 

293.57 295.71 A: that's awful [laughter] 

294.79 297.78 B: oh but and 

298.19 300.29 B: and in some ways find 

301.19 302.15 B: (( that )) 

302.27 302.84 B: (( [mn] )) 

302.91 309.00 B: it also tends to make us very impatient people because we want it and we want it now and the computers 

310.84 314.72 A: you're right and as fast as a computer can go sometimes 

310.86 311.61 B: (( ah )) 

314.38 315.78 B: yeah 

315.17 319.45 A: it's not fast enough and just instills that in us that's right 

316.57 317.74 B: yeah 

319.14 328.34 B: yeah i spent two weeks over in germany with my husband on a business trip and i was talking to um some of the people over there and 

328.50 338.72 B: because they're all very good at not speaking english and [laughter] we're not so very good about speaking german [laughter] um ah one of the people pointed out that 

331.87 333.24 A: that's always helpful 

334.21 335.14 A: [laughter] 

339.48 345.42 B: well we're talking about how slow things are over in germany like if you go to a if you're planning on going out to eat at a restaurant 

345.89 347.07 B: you take a 

347.36 352.39 B: good just plan for a good two hours because it takes forever for them to do anything 

352.15 353.37 A: oh wow 

352.80 358.32 B: that's just because that's what we're used to over here you know we've got 

358.73 373.04 B: ah walmart and mcdon- i mean they have mcdonald's there too but we're just a very we want it and we want it now type of society where over there you know you actually sit down and enjoy a meal you know you have conversation before during and after the meal and it's just 

372.89 374.06 B: more of a 

375.39 378.93 B: [lipsmack] a peaceful time as opposed to you know 

377.32 378.67 A: right 

379.41 388.52 A: i've also heard and this has nothing to do with computers i wonder if we'll get in trouble for this [laughter] i've also heard that um in europe the portions of meals are smaller too 

382.78 383.51 B: (( oops )) 

388.80 389.86 B: um 

388.92 391.37 A: did did you notice that 

391.21 392.44 B: um 

393.43 397.92 A: i have a lot to do with education and computers but [laughter] 

395.85 400.82 B: yeah [laughter] i i didn't notice anything noticeable um 

401.60 404.36 B: i think it was relatively about the the same 

405.56 408.38 B: but yeah i suppose we should get back to computers huh 

407.71 409.46 A: yeah [laughter] 

408.82 410.91 B: attention please um 

410.15 411.00 A: (( i )) 

411.20 414.87 B: let's see [laughter] um 

412.58 413.71 A: (( don't think )) 

415.30 417.09 A: as far as education 

415.49 424.11 B: i'm working on only a couple of hours of sleep so a few hours of sleep so my brain's not functioning as fast as it normally would [laughter] but um 

418.21 419.44 A: oh no 

424.75 434.93 B: [lipsmack] mm i guess i'm having a hard time really understanding what they use in the schools 'cause my children my eldest is going to be three in june 

434.60 435.84 A: oh okay 

435.12 437.39 B: and when i was in high school 

437.56 438.36 B: or when 

437.60 439.47 A: all they had was programming 

439.27 444.21 B: yeah exactly i mean we were so back windows what was that you know and 

439.80 440.82 A: [laughter] 

441.03 442.02 A: right 

443.39 448.81 A: exactly we learned how to programme basic which was apple but where where is that now nowhere 

445.96 447.12 B: yeah 

448.01 449.34 B: (( exactly )) 

449.10 456.77 A: but yeah i've got um a twelve year old and a lot of the programmes that we have um there's a 

457.16 460.37 A: one series of them that um just there's one 

460.63 469.13 A: they are fun programmes they are not curriculum programmes where they um just per each grade and they go overall the different basics um 

462.83 463.81 B: mhm 

469.14 477.92 A: over and over again i even have one that my four and a half year old uses that helped him learn how to spell his name his name is oh about ten letters long 

475.06 475.89 B: oh 

477.64 478.55 B: uh-huh 

478.13 481.01 A: and he's already knows knows how to spell his first name 

480.88 481.91 B: wow 

481.39 492.25 A: but um then on the other hand it is an obsession for him because he just wants to play the computer all the time [laughter] and i have to cut that off and send him outside or give him you know do a distraction 

486.60 488.04 B: mhm 

492.26 493.27 A: for him 

493.87 502.31 A: get some type of distraction going because otherwise he would sit there all day and it is educational but you know like you said it's definitely [laughter] 

502.53 506.44 A: that addiction there is not good all the time you can't do just one thing 

506.12 507.26 B: yeah 

506.61 510.15 A: constantly your life definitely isn't enriched by 

510.66 513.94 A: doing just one thing i know that that the programmes are different 

514.06 518.78 A: and the activities are different but sitting there is definitely sedentary [laughter] 

518.34 526.01 B: yeah my my husband was saying that he definitely has a white collar rear end [laughter] 'cause he's you 

522.94 524.74 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

526.23 530.08 B: know that's what he does all day is sit in front of the computer and he does 

530.27 537.28 B: computer stuff and he looks like all he does is sit at a computer all day i mean he's not like huge or anything but he's 

534.15 535.05 A: yeah 

537.67 542.42 A: well it affects our our lives it affects our physical wellbeing 

541.25 542.23 B: yeah 

542.46 548.18 A: and you know when you get to that obsession part of it it definitely affects our mental wellbeing too 

547.86 548.86 B: yeah 

548.37 548.91 A: (( i )) 

549.09 557.59 A: mean then you can also go i guess as far as like your social skills 'cause i know a lot of people well maybe not a lot but i know some people who um 

557.93 559.65 A: would definitely ah 

559.92 562.11 A: say that their social skills are lacking 

561.94 563.26 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

562.19 566.95 A: as far as interpersonal skills because all they're used to doing is is um 

567.35 569.00 A: communicating through email 

568.77 574.80 B: right or all they can only communicate in ah abbreviated ah [laughter] 

569.43 570.50 A: or whatever 

573.28 574.57 A: (( right )) 

574.86 577.92 A: i did see an article on that one [laughter] 

576.54 580.50 B: [laughter] yeah l. o. l. l. o. l. [laughter] 

578.72 584.08 A: yeah exactly [laughter] i've got a my daughter's friend is fourteen and 

583.90 594.47 A: she actually they actually have a little bit of their english class where they told them that they were not allowed to use these abbreviated words and they had all this list of abbreviated words [laughter] because they were writing a paper 

592.08 592.94 B: (( [laughter] )) 

594.62 597.76 A: and apparently these kids were sticking them in their paper too 

597.58 598.73 B: yeah 

598.04 598.94 A: so 

599.45 599.89 A: no
