4.72 5.74 B: ohio 

5.33 9.88 A: oh that's where my husband's from we were just talking about ohio i'm from florida 

9.89 10.99 B: oh 

10.43 13.16 A: so we're down here in the brush fire season 

13.55 14.66 B: (( [noise] ah )) 

14.05 19.98 A: well so the topic is what other countries do we feel that is or could be a threat to the united states 

19.40 20.76 B: (( mhm )) 

20.02 26.72 A: well i would probably say that china and hong kong or china's the m- uh north korea would be the biggest threat 

26.15 37.29 B: that's what i was going to say about north korea because i've heard that they have nuclear weapons and we don't seem to be bugging them knocking down their doors to try to get you know take away their weapons or anything 

27.84 28.88 A: yeah 

33.43 34.53 A: yeah 

35.31 36.32 A: right 

36.97 42.42 A: yeah well in china china's also involved in that too they're also heav- are heavily armed and uh 

41.86 44.04 B: (( [noise] yeah hm )) 

42.86 45.16 A: they do and i think they do a lot of supplying 

45.23 45.94 B: (( it's )) 

45.58 47.08 A: of them all so 

46.98 49.66 B: pretty suspicious that they're they're not part of the 

50.45 53.93 B: help right now [laughter] 

51.57 52.41 A: mhm 

53.29 56.88 A: well they're also they're i think they're a little afraid of offending them because 

56.97 62.37 A: um i saw i was reading that they had they were supposed to meet with them and um 

62.67 70.72 A: just recently they they said there was a like a sentence that had been taken out of context which basically was sort of a threatening manner 

70.49 71.74 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

70.86 73.31 A: which was a threat as to 

73.64 84.01 A: how they would disarm or how they would not disarm and they then they the united states was kind they kind of drew the line and asked them to step over it but then i saw on my internet site that it said 

84.03 89.79 A: well it's not that bad as it was it was really just a misunderstanding in terminology 

90.06 96.10 A: but um i don't know i think the united states is a little bit nervous about them because they know that china's there too 

90.09 91.01 B: hm 

96.30 101.03 A: and i think they feel that if if um north korea were to get 

97.08 97.89 B: (( [noise] )) 

101.14 108.58 A: um hinky with us i think that they were afraid that china would follow you know and i don't and they've got a lot bigger army than we do 

108.88 113.20 B: i think we've suddenly got something against france it seems [laughter] 

109.05 110.28 A: that's for sure 

112.64 120.85 A: yeah well i um well i was just watching the news about france today something about iraq is on right now about their their um 

121.11 127.17 A: um opinion of the embargoes and how things should be lifted not with iraq but um 

126.14 126.73 B: (( oh )) 

127.38 139.25 A: i would say i don't think france is any sort of a threat personally because i don't think they have the weapons weapons and i think from what i understand their army is very small and look how far they are from us they can't exactly surprise us 

128.51 131.45 B: (( yeah )) 

139.08 139.73 B: (( okay )) 

139.31 147.33 A: but then again you've got north korea and china over there and they have they have you know uh nuclear weapons that can make it over here to our coast 

147.87 149.68 B: yeah 

148.78 150.42 A: they're able to do it 

151.12 158.11 B: i've seen that they're worrying a little bit about russia keep working on with them as far as the space program you know 

154.09 155.08 A: yeah 

157.18 160.90 A: right well yeah well i mean it's like the um 

161.26 168.07 A: russia supplying the um the syrian weapons and things like that and the iraq weapons and um 

165.19 167.16 B: (( oh yeah )) 

168.56 173.37 A: i mean i was i'm a kid of the i was born in the middle fifties so i'm a kid of the um 

174.36 182.33 A: of the um the first when it was the china i mean not china i'm sorry the cuba blockade and everything and they found the missiles and everything 

179.86 182.10 B: (( mhm )) 

182.43 184.93 A: we were just rewatching that movie the other day 

185.37 194.25 A: realizing how close that we had came i mean i was only a child when that happened but we were they were very close to them and they were getting ready to launch against us there 

194.42 196.40 A: and you know i think the 

196.91 204.72 A: my opinion is that north korea and china are sort of in cahoots with the russians i mean they're all communist countries 

204.95 207.88 A: and they just don't look at life the way we do 

208.46 210.96 B: ah so the problem might be
