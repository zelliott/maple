48.77 52.61 B: you know everybody has bombs everybody wants control 

52.97 66.06 B: and just for us as being [noise] a nation who's only been in existence for a little over four hundred and fifty years and having other nations who've been around for at least five thousand plus years 

66.04 69.66 B: we're a baby nation who comes into the world screaming peace 

69.91 75.29 B: and everybody's mad you know we're 'cause there's the land of milk and honey [noise] 

75.39 77.00 B: you know and 

76.36 78.60 A: so they're jealous is what you're saying 

78.42 80.33 B: yes very much so 

80.05 80.96 A: oh 

81.12 86.27 A: so are you coming when you're saying a biblical stance you're talking about the christian bible [noise] okay 

85.70 87.31 B: [noise] yes i am [noise] 

88.70 97.46 B: or even or even or even if you want to go i don't really know too much i can't read hebrew but it's still basically from the hebrew bible also 

88.72 90.18 A: (( so [noise] )) 

97.53 98.63 A: okay 

99.30 101.31 A: (( hm so [noise] )) 

102.48 104.60 A: do you think that 

107.85 112.53 A: that there are certain areas of the world that are more of a threat to the u._s. 

113.06 115.17 B: (( [sigh] um [lipsmack] )) 

115.45 127.75 B: as of now [sigh] see i- that's like a trick question um [laughter] because i mean you could say well north korea look at what they're coming up with 

120.74 123.47 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] [noise] )) 

128.20 138.48 B: and then if you want to say china i mean ch- how long has china been asleep for china been asleep for like four hundred years and all of a sudden they wake up and they wanna talk to the world 

138.55 142.61 B: and there was a they were a self sufficient they never traded with anybody 

143.17 146.37 B: you know and all of sudden they got input 

146.39 148.43 B: into what's going on in the world 

149.16 153.86 B: and for immediate threat i'm gonna say 

154.22 155.45 B: no 

155.57 159.11 B: for a future threat yes there's a 

158.08 159.51 A: oh oh in china 

159.66 174.63 B: uh well n- i mean i'll say china and i'm going to say iraq i'm going to say syria i'm going to say africa i'm going to say all tho- all the countries that even france all the countries that really not with us 

174.74 176.41 B: are going to jump on us 

176.74 179.33 B: because of the simple fact is who are we 

179.55 184.86 B: to sit here and to delegate our lifestyle onto another country 

185.15 193.28 B: and in doing that and because of our spiritual beliefs or what nations we're under 

193.51 201.61 B: you know it's like well i- it's like the thing where you're saying well don't push your religion on me but then you flip around and push yours on somebody else 

201.83 210.25 B: and that kind of sense and i believe it's a spiritual battle that's been going on since the day adam and eve destroyed themself within the garden 

210.41 212.17 B: so [laughter] 

211.86 219.80 A: so do you think that that's why bush uh attacked iraq was basically from from a religious standpoint 

219.35 220.89 B: [sigh] um 

220.95 223.18 B: yes but not in his eyes 

223.66 224.56 A: (( oh )) 

223.66 236.88 B: [lipsmack] it's one thing it's one thing about human beings we look at things in two different lights okay i- some of us look at it spiritual and some of us look at it as doing the right thing according to man 

237.44 239.98 B: i don't think he actually knew 

240.54 255.22 B: know the outcome of what he started you know but he believed that he was doing the right thing do i think it's from a spiritual thing no i think it's more from a political and money and oil and things of that nature 

255.42 258.61 A: [noise] [noise] but but in your mind it was the right thing to do 

258.47 271.31 B: yes in my mind it was the right thing to do i mean it's like you're having a bully in the world or a bully at your school if a bully jumps on you and beats you up every day you don't do nothing about it he'll keep messing with you 

261.17 262.07 A: (( mm [mn] )) 

271.72 279.07 B: but nine times out of ten if you stand up to him show him you're not afraid anymore and you're not going to take it any more they back down 

279.70 280.31 A: (( mm )) 

281.44 282.26 A: huh 

281.67 290.61 B: and so and so what e- if we didn't do something [noise] about what had happened whether if we picked the wrong country or nothing or 

290.65 296.77 B: or or the wrong country if we put up or bow down now and so checked it out this is what we're not going to do 

297.08 298.97 B: you know and where the 

297.45 305.92 A: but so you don't think that that set a precedent um b- because we had never attacked basically attacked a country without 

306.54 310.36 A: them blowing y- you know hitting us first 

310.52 311.83 A: in some way 

310.55 321.79 B: well yes okay yeah i and i understand and i agree with you a hundred percent we haven't did that but we have to understand what the united states stands for also outta every other country there is 

322.18 328.41 B: if they go to war let's say if iraq went to war with iran they'll take over iran and keep it 

328.47 333.58 B: we're the only nation that'll beat you up and they give you back your country and help you rebuild it 

334.36 335.01 A: (( mm )) 

335.47 337.00 A: so that makes it okay 

337.18 351.21 B: no i'm not s- saying it makes it okay but what i'm saying is that it's deeper than what we think you know as human beings i believe like i said it's a spiritual thing whether if it was bush 

351.29 353.31 B: if it was president clinton 

353.44 355.25 B: if it was jimmy carter 

355.79 359.96 B: it's not it's not our hands that really at work within this 

360.37 371.94 B: you know we say you know it's human it's us it's bush i think it's two greater powers that's been at this battle for a long time and things will just have to play out and then there's other coun- 

370.73 371.84 A: okay so 

371.94 375.47 A: so it's fate or or or predetermined 

373.06 373.66 B: (( [cough] )) 

375.19 384.52 B: yeah it's predetermined better yet yeah you could say it like that and you know us as human beings we're going to protest it oh this is wrong this is that and that and this 

376.67 377.82 A: oh 

378.64 379.65 A: okay 

384.37 397.42 B: you know uh but and i i mean i have these conversations all the time and that's just like me saying to other people the same ones who protest the war [laughter] are the same ones who are willing to um have an abortion 

397.53 404.09 B: so what's the difference between killing a unborn child but then you to going over there fighting for your country 

397.85 398.81 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

404.28 411.79 B: you know i mean this is like a deep topic for me and i'm trying to go off the subject um [laughter] 

408.75 414.79 A: [laughter] right but are are we fighting for our country i mean 

414.97 416.02 A: were we 

415.13 416.24 B: are we fight- 

416.32 418.46 A: were we in iraq 

416.58 417.67 B: um 

418.51 419.79 B: in iraq 

419.19 420.61 A: or in iran mm 

420.64 424.33 B: are are were we fighting for our country yes 

425.00 433.54 B: in the sense of you know these are countries even though they have their own spiritual and uh religious personalities 

433.67 441.63 B: yes i believe so because when another person will take their own life to kill ten other people you need to shut them up 

441.72 443.01 B: because they have 

441.73 453.03 A: o- o- ok okay if you're if you're coming from a religious base and and we're going over there but we're going to give them back their country they're not going to become christian 

446.34 447.51 B: mhm 

453.14 454.06 B: no 

453.17 456.11 A: and and you're saying you're coming from a christian 

454.08 455.01 B: and 

455.71 460.88 B: a- yeah and and and in that sense and that sense is 

457.11 458.27 A: (( viewpoint mhm )) 

461.05 466.11 B: no they don't have to become christian because that's not what we're trying to do 

466.63 475.12 B: as a nation we're not trying to make them christian more a democratic type thing but not christian and they going to keep their religion 

475.48 484.24 B: but on the on the other hand of what i'm saying is that if you were to believe in a god and you were to believe in a satan 

484.45 494.11 B: and this was a war between them two and we're just stuck in the middle of it that's a different thing if we're not looking in human eyes 

494.40 498.94 B: let's say that let's say satan wanted us to jump on i- iraq 

499.19 510.01 B: okay so he did this he made the towers get blown up because he knew we were going to react to it so we react to it now the other world is watching us all of the world is watching us 

510.21 516.30 B: and says well who are these people to jump on these people not knowing if it was them or not 

517.24 526.53 B: okay then it says okay now everybody says well we're afraid of the united states the united states is a strong country but united together we can destroy them 

527.75 528.54 A: (( oh )) 

527.78 529.14 B: (( you understand what i'm saying )) 

528.81 529.72 A: yeah 

529.86 530.80 B: okay 

530.11 532.40 A: and is that do you think that's going to happen 

532.24 543.74 B: oh yeah i believe that's definitely going to happen i mean first i mean 'cause in the bible it says in the end there will be wars or rumors of wars we've been having that for quite a while now 

543.86 549.33 B: it says but those but it says that there will come a time when they will scream for peace 

543.92 544.68 A: so 

550.23 555.11 B: and don't believe the peace for it won't last long so right now 

553.71 556.54 A: so you think that armageddon's around the corner 

556.41 558.24 B: (( yeah )) 

557.53 558.80 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

558.77 564.66 B: on my personal belief you know and i don't press my beliefs on nobody else but my personal belief yes 

562.57 563.41 A: uh-huh 

564.83 567.82 B: i believe this what just happened here 

567.91 571.33 B: was a sign of what's to come 

571.59 573.84 B: it's it's starting the ball rolling 

574.99 580.37 B: and yes there's other countries that do not like us and in the end they gonna destroy us 

583.25 585.68 A: i- a middle east country do you think 

585.48 587.89 B: yeah well i mean 

586.74 587.45 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

588.29 599.16 B: it's everybody who's like i said i won't even say middle east i'll say everybody who's not and who don't understand or believe in what we stand for how's that so that could be 

598.39 599.89 A: okay does that does
