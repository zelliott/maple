1.10 3.17 A: (( [noise] hi this is marissa )) 

3.07 5.70 B: hi this is errol how are you 

5.16 6.73 A: i'm good how are you 

6.39 7.51 B: good 

8.07 13.42 B: so the topic is education and computers i believe 

13.13 14.76 A: mhm 

13.90 15.02 B: okay 

15.34 17.73 B: so what do you think about 

17.88 20.83 B: computers and education and all that 

20.84 24.16 A: i think they're a good resource for education i think it makes 

24.18 27.15 A: research a lot easier in a lot of ways 

28.41 33.77 A: ah and i think that it exposes kids to more 

34.70 36.75 A: it could also be bad because 

37.53 40.23 A: it depends what you want to expose 

40.27 41.49 A: kids to 

41.47 42.51 B: right 

41.79 43.20 A: there can be some 

43.23 48.15 A: some sketchy issues with the internet but at the same time i think all in all it's a good thing 

50.08 51.12 A: because 

50.83 58.99 B: i i would i would agree with you in that i think computers are great because you can access 

59.63 71.34 B: very large amounts of information at a very short amount of time and i think that's good i think it's unfortunate however though that because i've worked in education myself 

71.47 74.23 B: and i've found that kids a lot of times 

74.61 85.53 B: misuse computers in the sense that they want to play games a lot i'm and i'm speaking at school particularly when they are supposed to be doing education types of things x. 

83.70 84.33 A: (( [cough] )) 

84.93 86.60 A: mhm 

85.89 94.67 B: stuff a lot of times they want to play games and listen to music and do other things that are not real productive 

94.93 103.46 B: and um but all in all i'd along with you i think that computers are great things yeah a great tool that can be used to 

103.87 109.08 B: um gain a terrifically large amount of knowledge 

106.14 107.04 A: [noise] 

109.62 111.34 B: and information rather 

111.89 113.93 A: yeah i think that's part of the 

114.71 116.71 A: the nicest part about 

117.07 124.22 A: computers is that people can get information about things that they're curious about be it music or i mean games are not 

124.41 127.24 A: games are fun you know and 

127.00 133.30 B: i don't see anything wrong with i i wasn't saying that that it's bad se- that games are bad 

133.05 134.19 A: mhm 

133.50 146.00 B: but i mean i think a lot of kids use them just to play games primarily to play games that you know as opposed to using them to do research and do other things that they're supposed to be doing 

146.01 148.64 B: you know like at school and that kind of thing 

148.03 151.24 A: oh absolutely if the games are a little bit addictive 

150.82 152.10 B: right they are 

151.74 152.92 A: [laughter] 

152.45 158.91 B: and actually i'm i'm not really into the game playing anyway i've never really liked games that much 

159.09 162.13 B: but a lot of people are and i can understand that 

162.25 170.84 B: but i think there's a time and a place for everything and you know when it's time to work it's time to work and when it's time to play it's time to play 

170.75 172.64 A: that's true that's true 

172.70 175.25 A: but i think that they they also help develop 

175.30 183.14 A: skills i mean computers aren't going to go away [laughter] so i think they're important to education for everybody so that people could get jobs where their 

183.81 187.98 A: computer literacy is not really an issue you 

188.13 192.73 B: right and i agree i agree they're definitely not going away 

188.15 189.02 A: (( know )) 

193.63 200.92 B: they're not going anywhere i mean they've been here for a while now and i think all of us kind of see that they're here to st- 

193.72 194.76 A: i think 

202.16 206.75 B: i know a lot of people who still haven't quite gotten on the band wagon 

207.99 221.63 A: it's true but but now as a part of education i mean i can there are a lot of pros and cons to how they could be used but i think it's almost like a necessary method of socialization is to learn how to use the computer because 

221.64 223.10 A: they're so 

223.27 224.15 A: ah 

224.35 228.21 A: all over the place you can't you can't really do a lot 

228.17 232.66 B: without yeah you can i mean everywhere you go in every industry 

233.06 238.06 B: every job just about you know you can't you can't escape it 

238.09 239.61 A: [laughter] 

238.73 241.99 B: it's something that you definitely need to need to know 

242.03 253.70 A: yeah so i guess it's more like [laughter] people have to learn it because [laughter] whether or not it's good for your education [laughter] it's necessary for your life i mean not entirely but for the most part 

253.73 259.12 A: and it it does makes things easier it makes communication easier it makes 

261.12 264.15 A: but i think communication is kind of cute 

264.58 269.91 A: it makes that easier and it makes finding out about what you're interested in easier 

270.71 274.67 A: whatever that may be it might be something really removed from wherever you are 

275.05 278.12 A: ah like a book doesn't have libraries on 

278.72 287.80 A: or your library doesn't have books on certain things you can just look it up on the internet and to an certain extent that's that's good it could also be bad because 

288.20 294.32 A: information is not always right on [laughter] but you know you can get an idea of it 

294.29 297.95 B: what what do you mean it's not always right what what do you mean by that 

297.40 305.32 A: i mean there's a lot of misinformation out there and i mean it happens in books too but i think it's a little less likely to happen in books than it is 

305.64 310.37 A: for someone to just post bogus information on the internet 

310.19 313.94 B: you know and and you know that's a very good point because 

314.13 319.01 B: it's a lot easier for people to post information to the internet and 

318.13 320.13 A: than it is to publish something 

319.69 321.76 B: to publish a whole book 

321.81 328.87 A: it's true it's true i mean even though there's plenty of like bogus publications out there now it's still a little bit 

322.01 322.85 B: (( you know )) 

328.93 332.12 A: (( a little bit harder [laughter] i would think )) 

331.92 338.08 B: and i would think that the the people who are actually legitimate i guess it's the lack of a better word 

338.26 344.88 B: people who are actual authorities on certain information or certain topics are more likely to 

344.98 347.02 B: have an opportunity to act- 

346.25 349.06 A: to publish books yes so do they 

347.24 348.31 B: publish 

348.98 362.82 B: than to than to post something on the internet anybody can post something on the internet and and claim to be an authority on that i think you just have to be careful about what sources you you ah put your trust in 

362.85 364.03 A: that's true 

364.23 378.79 B: you know and lend credence to because there are a lot of um unreliable sources of information out there on the net but i don't think i think people kind of tend to think that whatever they read on the net is gospel too 

378.75 382.61 B: and i think that's a real danger [laughter] you know 

382.07 390.62 A: yeah i know i get forwards from my mom about like what i shouldn't eat [laughter] and like where i shouldn't go based on that 

390.47 392.42 B: on stuff she read on the net 

391.66 396.36 A: yeah [laughter] her friends forward her all these things like beware of this 

396.56 409.82 A: da da da da da da so many people have gotten scammed by this or this or that i'm like it's it's a nice heads up it's so it's out there it's kind of understanding sometimes but at the same time 

410.24 411.02 A: (( mm )) 

411.73 413.50 A: you you do people i 

413.53 415.52 A: think that people kind of like 

415.78 419.43 A: enjoy a good scare every once and a while and the the 

419.71 423.47 A: [laughter] the way that you can pass information around on the internet 

423.55 427.54 A: makes it so that they can just perpetuate it themselves completely 

427.92 440.63 B: that's interesting too because i i think you're right i think a lot of people get a big kick out of being able to pass information around and scare people because you can do it very quickly very efficiently 

440.06 446.94 A: and you you seem to be some sort of authority figure because it's been supposedly legitimated by however many people it's been sent to you know 

446.67 447.94 B: right 

447.22 448.24 A: like 

448.84 450.79 A: there's this new disease 

451.14 452.13 B: yeah 

451.20 458.72 A: don't answer your door to postmen wearing brown hats it's like anything you could find something out there but 

459.62 460.43 A: mm 

460.35 468.04 B: that's true and and but usually like if i'm looking if if i'm doing research on a certain illness or disease or 

468.05 475.67 B: something like that i try to stay away from doing searches like sometimes i just ty- go to yahoo and type in 

475.71 481.58 B: whatever i'm looking for but usually i like to go to a certain website like web m._d. 

482.27 486.29 A: i those things make me nervous i have to admit 

486.97 489.34 A: i mean [noise] i don't 

490.04 492.29 A: i know that web m._d. is you know 

492.47 494.22 A: the legitimate 

494.47 500.75 A: thing that we see advertised on t._v. but [noise] oops at the same time it's like 

500.79 503.68 A: i have some friends that are ah very 

503.79 512.07 A: pretty like adamant hypochondriacs and they stuff isn't good maybe information isn't so good so easy [laughter] 

511.45 521.97 B: and you get such large amounts of information on different topics like illnesses they lifted the all the symptoms and you go yeah i 

521.30 523.95 A: oh i have that [laughter] 

523.47 531.38 B: i have been feeling a little bit dizzy and yeah my eyes are a little red and my nails are starting to get a little brittle and 

530.77 531.73 A: (( [laughter] )) 

533.12 535.12 A: the power of suggestion 

535.61 542.00 A: i think that kids are a lot more susceptible to sug- maybe not maybe not but i feel like ah 

535.61 536.36 B: yeah 

542.65 546.82 A: i feel like as we get older we should be a little bit more disbelieving 

547.18 548.51 A: and 

549.58 550.43 A: ah 

551.81 558.36 A: i don't know it depends on what sort of education you're talking about like what level of education i think it would be great for really young kids to 

558.40 561.86 A: just be able to like look up stuff about dinosaurs and 

562.01 565.10 A: play kind of like dinosaur games and 

565.36 567.02 B: yeah 

566.98 569.56 A: you know whatever pilot games 

570.22 573.02 B: yeah i i agree i 

573.07 583.96 B: a lot of that stuff i i have read some really interesting stuff on the internet and and they have been like i have done inform- i've done research on ah like herbs 

584.61 596.38 B: now that's a topic that to me is kind of i think the jury is still out on whether herbs actually work for a lot of different ailments and diseases and what not 

597.11 599.89 A: yeah i just heard something on the radio today about how
