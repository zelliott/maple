356.47 357.71 A: when i was ah 

358.58 371.99 A: 'cause see i got really deep into christianity about five years ago and that's what scared me out of it was knowing too much because i mean thoughts and flashes came to me and stuff and ah

393.79 397.61 A: one religion one government one this one that 

397.82 399.85 A: one monetary system 

400.18 404.01 B: well that's yeah i thought about that when they brought the euro in 

403.76 418.62 A: yeah yeah and that was the beginning and what's gonna really be scary is when they and the reason they're getting ren- rid of these renegades like you know saddam i mean yes he needs to be getting gotten rid of and kim jong-il 

418.55 420.03 A: from north korea 

420.45 423.28 A: the reason they need to get rid of them is because 

423.32 426.54 A: they can't do what they want to be done 

426.65 436.45 A: with those kind of people in power in places you know they call it democracy but it's actually um we're no we're no freer than the iraqis were 

437.32 443.29 B: no i don't believe so i think the only thing freedom we have is the freedom of speech 

437.32 437.96 A: (( i )) 

438.31 439.09 A: (( mean )) 

443.51 448.52 A: and try and sort that out have you seen the news lately they're trying to cut that out even 

443.73 445.77 B: we can say what we want 

448.94 453.48 A: i mean they're they're trying to say that protesting the war is ah 

453.80 456.59 A: giving aid and comfort to the enemy 

457.56 458.93 A: isn't that silly 

458.92 460.48 B: well my 

460.03 462.74 A: yeah aid and comfort to the enemy 

463.39 468.64 A: just because somebody doesn't believe in killing innocent you know civilians and their brothers 

468.53 470.76 B: that does bother me 

468.72 472.44 A: having their brothers having their brothers and sisters 

472.52 476.57 A: well the way i see it is we need both sides of 

476.95 478.51 A: this conflict 

478.61 485.21 A: you know we need the people that say no war and we need the people that say let's kill 'em all 

485.41 489.84 A: you know if we didn't have and believe it or not i learned this from south park 

490.60 496.88 A: but ah if we didn't have the people that say no war we would all look like a bunch of war mongers 

496.94 500.76 A: and if we didn't have the people that said you know let's kill 'em all 

500.85 503.29 A: we would have been run over a long time ago 

503.47 506.27 A: you know what i mean we'd be speaking french right now 

508.87 512.41 B: well it did upset me that france didn't support us 

511.81 516.77 A: i have never liked the french i've got french blood in me and 

516.87 519.78 A: if there was some way to filter it out i would 

520.12 521.77 A: i'm i mean i'm just 

521.09 523.64 B: that's a very strong statement 

523.15 524.99 A: [laughter] 

524.86 526.38 B: it really is 

526.46 538.87 A: well i mean they ah you know they've got their reasons for not wanting to go to war well their reasons is because they're the ones that have the contracts in iraq for the oil production right now 

539.15 543.59 A: and iraq owes them a lot of money so no they don't want to go war 

542.42 544.79 B: well the french owe us money 

544.71 546.82 A: well yeah i'm sure that they do 

547.13 548.06 A: and 

548.08 550.04 A: they also have ah 

550.55 553.22 A: they they they talk about other countries

571.92 574.22 A: puerto rico and the virgin islands 

574.07 577.88 B: yeah 

574.72 578.97 A: you know but those are little biddy places that need us 

579.01 584.48 A: you know they need us they need somebody and it might as well be us well the french are still 

584.45 592.59 A: neck deep in africa you know stirring up trouble there left and right trying to be in charge you know trying to 

592.52 599.96 A: throw their weight around they talk about you know oh no more nuclear testing or ban the bomb they are the only
