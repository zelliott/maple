109.41 110.61 B: mhm 

109.95 112.65 A: um they were going to school in oregon at the time 

112.96 118.84 A: and they were way ahead 'cause when we came to texas the kids were doing it learning it as a freshman in high school so 

118.62 119.58 B: yeah 

120.43 122.46 A: but then do you have a computer at home too 

122.43 124.63 B: mhm actually she has her own 

122.97 123.81 A: yeah 

125.22 127.51 B: as well i use mine for work so to 

127.56 131.77 B: kind of avoid the argument she got one for christmas for her own room 

132.51 133.25 B: (( so )) 

134.08 136.38 A: [laughter] do do you have to filter it 

136.30 139.72 B: yes we filter it and she does not have an email account 

139.93 141.95 B: and she doesn't have um 

142.21 142.99 B: she 

143.63 145.67 B: my brother in law kind of is 

146.59 151.62 B: very skilled in building computers and he went in we're networked together he went in 

151.65 158.36 B: and she's only allowed not only is it filtered but she can only go to web sites that were put on a list 

158.43 160.45 B: it won't open anything else up 

159.88 161.84 A: oh wow that's great 

161.20 166.09 B: so we had her go through and pick like i guess there's about fifteen sites on there 

166.23 167.70 B: that she can go to 

168.19 170.87 B: i mean it won't open anything up else up so 

168.27 169.55 A: i imagine it's something 

170.00 170.83 A: yeah 

171.02 175.79 A: a second grader isn't quite as scary as when they start getting a little bit older 

175.49 176.58 B: mhm 

175.95 176.77 A: um 

177.20 180.37 A: about sixth grade fifth grade i think they start thinking that they're 

180.56 184.66 A: grown up and can do all these grown up things and that's really scary 

182.53 183.56 B: right 

184.34 188.80 B: i think it scares her more before he got over here to put a filter on 

188.99 189.78 B: um 

190.72 193.99 B: she was looking for one of the web sites that she goes to 

194.02 195.96 B: um it's like a um 

196.58 197.42 B: girls' 

197.68 198.79 B: web site 

198.77 201.86 A: oh okay like girl power or something like that 

198.98 199.84 B: for 

200.18 208.24 B: preteen and teenage girls right something along those lines and she typed the actual website is the initials and she just typed in 

208.41 210.21 B: the entire name and 

210.76 212.64 B: i think it's girls in action 

212.70 218.86 B: is what it is and instead of g. i. a. she typed in girls in action and she came flying out of her room 

219.17 221.00 B: (( mom [laughter] )) 

220.00 223.56 A: [laughter] you've you've trained her well 

222.35 232.03 B: i still yeah it scared her to death well we also made clear to her that anything she does on that computer we know about we can watch her from in here 

231.88 237.76 B: on the computer or i can go in there and pull up any place she's been and any anything she's done 

237.18 239.99 A: okay so she knows she can't pull anything over you 

238.37 241.10 B: so she knows that she can't get away with right 

240.37 241.79 A: [laughter] 

241.14 247.94 B: and so she wanted to make sure that as soon as something popped up that she knew wasn't supposed to be on there she came flying out of that bedroom 

247.19 248.68 A: [laughter] 

248.07 251.71 B: fix it fix it close it i can't get it to turn off 

251.94 256.26 A: now do your kids when they're at school do they have to have special permission to use um the internet 

256.43 258.01 B: ah we 

257.22 259.01 A: or aren't they using it there yet 

258.12 260.37 B: we signed a release 

262.26 264.18 B: ah the very first week of school 

264.51 265.37 A: (( oh okay )) 

264.70 266.41 B: allowing them to do stuff 

267.25 267.89 B: (( so )) 

268.21 270.64 B: i'm not sure what kind of filters they have there 

271.13 280.08 B: on line but most for the most part they don't do much surfing at this age when she gets older i'm sure she will for research and things like that mostly they're teaching them basic skills right now 

277.10 277.99 A: right 

280.29 285.24 A: oh i was a substitute teacher in a high school and those kids had to have a special um 

286.12 288.93 A: i._d. that allowed them to go on the internet 

288.76 302.87 A: their parents had to sign all these contracts and everything and then they had to so that they couldn't just come in and say oh my mom signed it because you get busy in the library and you don't know who's doing what but they had the special place up there that they had to set that special i._d. 

288.81 289.60 B: yeah 

297.42 298.57 B: right 

302.71 304.70 A: so that anybody walking through there 

302.86 303.48 B: (( hm )) 

304.39 305.37 B: could see 

305.30 310.33 A: could see right away that that person wasn't supposed to be on the computer the were trying to pull something 

308.69 309.71 B: right 

310.62 314.66 A: and at the high school age they always try to pull something [laughter] 

313.04 315.78 B: [laughter] absolutely 

316.19 317.08 A: um 

318.25 319.71 A: they did 

319.84 322.69 A: i i subbed in a couple of classes that um 

323.30 326.24 A: were computer training in different it was like um 

327.05 336.39 A: a tech class to show them the different areas that they could use computers in and yeah it was it was really interesting 'cause one of them was like weather related and um 

331.41 332.35 B: right 

336.85 340.03 A: graphic arts and things like that 

340.49 342.33 A: quite amazing what they ah 

340.75 341.32 B: (( i ))

365.46 371.21 B: storms they check the weather every day they relate ah have discussion on um 

371.32 378.92 B: you know barometric pressure things like that and they incorporate having that there as a service to you know the community 

378.93 383.00 B: they use it as ah to teach their lessons in weather 

383.15 384.17 B: as well 

384.19 389.04 A: now does your um school system offer any adult education computer classes

437.13 438.19 B: yeah 

440.09 442.38 B: (( that's what we're probably going to have to do with my father ))

447.07 448.83 A: yeah the great big ones 

448.39 452.86 B: yeah [laughter] i was trying to convince him with with um my brother 

448.91 449.74 A: [laughter] 

453.63 464.96 B: all my brothers are pretty much spread out tennessee and texas and my youngest is in the air force so he jumps around a lot that's the easiest way to keep in touch with everybody is on the computer 'cause we're we've 

465.29 474.17 B: the kids have gotten i myself included my brothers are the same we're on the computer all the time but it i won't put pen to paper and mail a letter but i'll email you in a heart beat [laughter] 

473.38 478.49 A: that's right it's gotten to the point where i'm not real sure how to use a pen and pencil anymore 

477.15 483.42 B: right between that and you know using the instant messaging and the voice and everything and not having to pay for phone calls 

483.58 485.90 B: anymore i think he's about ready to 

485.93 487.86 B: to go buy one and 

487.91 491.34 B: so then we'll have to get him educated on that as well 

490.35 492.68 A: and it's really simple um 

492.72 496.17 A: my mom at first would freak out my son works for microsoft and she was 

496.25 503.82 A: calling him constantly what do i do about this and he kept saying grandma you can't break the computer [laughter] just try things 

501.28 502.81 B: [laughter] 

503.20 504.76 B: [laughter] 

503.92 505.59 A: [laughter] yeah and um 

506.89 512.63 A: it she's really doing very well on it every now and then she'll have to get my brother over there to help with something 

512.32 513.43 B: mhm 

512.78 514.77 A: but ah for the most part 

515.73 523.29 A: it she um three years ago they bought a word processor but that's all it did was word processing and my brothers and i said 

523.37 531.82 A: that's a waste of money get a computer my dad said oh i don't want a computer i don't need to play games et cetera well now he's one the biggest game players around [laughter] 

525.08 525.92 B: right 

531.66 535.54 B: [laughter] right that's what we usually my my brother in law lived in 

535.62 536.59 B: (( birmingham )) 

537.10 538.43 B: (( and )) 

538.75 552.54 B: my husband and my brother in law would talk and video cam you know showing the kids you know make the kids stand in front of the camera and wave and everything to my brother and he moved down here and got my father in law turned on to it so now that's what they do more than 

552.51 553.86 B: more than telephone 

553.70 554.95 A: mhm 

554.43 556.40 B: they don't really live that far away 

557.38 559.77 B: but it's still long distance so they still 

559.95 564.98 B: they still call us on that instead of the other and that you know and my daughter's 

565.64 570.41 B: gotten to where um she can do that without any help as well and she'll call her uncle 

571.04 572.12 B: you know and 

571.35 573.58 A: oh that's great 

572.95 585.44 B: do that she bugs him more than we do [laughter] if she sees that he's on line she'll get on there and and call him on the on the internet phone so [laughter] she goes it doesn't cost anything mommy you can't get mad at me [laughter] 

578.93 580.19 A: [laughter] 

583.66 585.23 A: that's right [laughter] 

585.76 587.82 A: she's calling the good people so 

587.58 597.59 B: right right that's right that's the only um access she has on her computer outside is is ah instant messaging and she we 

597.74 599.89 B: gave her a list on that too we're very
