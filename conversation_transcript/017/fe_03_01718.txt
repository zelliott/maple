0.24 2.19 B: hi my name is erin 

2.44 4.66 A: hi my name is mary 

4.28 5.38 B: hi mary 

6.09 7.84 B: so who do you consider to be a threat 

7.62 8.95 A: (( [cough] mm )) 

9.05 12.60 A: the only one that even comes close is maybe russia 

12.65 13.51 B: is what 

13.30 14.29 A: russia 

14.29 15.29 B: russia 

14.92 16.01 A: yeah 

15.37 18.53 B: i kind of think that north korea is definitely a threat to us right now 

18.36 19.20 A: (( do you yeah yeah )) 

20.26 29.31 B: i i just i don't trust them m- m- with the fact that they have nuclear missiles and and uh [sigh] with the way that they've been acting 

29.40 30.58 B: and now that iraq 

31.82 35.40 B: i think that we should definitely concentrate on north korea 

35.61 39.36 B: i used to think that palestine was a threat also but not any more 

39.97 46.03 A: i was kind of wondering about syria for a while but i- it i think they're going to back down real quick [laughter] right 

46.09 51.16 B: yeah that's how i feel also i mean as soon as as we told them to close their borders 

51.37 61.36 B: it they and they m- responded that's [sigh] that shows good intention to me and um they'd be foolish to take on the united states 'cause they've seen what happened in iraq 

60.79 61.86 A: right 

61.57 63.71 B: so that would just be ridiculous of them 

64.06 68.68 B: [lipsmack] i think that definitely if palestine were larger i'd say that they were a threat but 

69.09 73.32 B: [sigh] with everything that's going on uh in that whole region i think that 

73.55 77.62 B: we may find that somebody who we don't think is a threat might be a threat later on 

78.48 79.60 B: to us 

78.83 83.40 A: yeah that that whole area is just a ticking time bomb [laughter] right [noise] 

82.90 95.75 B: i- it is it is and and they're extremists so when you have an extremist religion like that it just i- it breeds hatred and i think that you know i think that we sh- still shouldn't rule out the afghan region also 

96.00 104.17 B: you know because they may not be a threat to the whole country but they may have cells inside that country or inside our country even 

104.23 105.93 A: right and you don't know 

106.26 111.95 A: yeah there's there's iran to deal with but i i think they're pretty much on our side 

111.39 113.50 B: (( [noise] yeah yeah )) 

112.32 117.00 A: and uh i i know they were getting real nervous over there for a while 

116.55 127.05 B: mhm i think that they have too many um [lipsmack] relations with money with us you know and and with england as well to even go there 

122.26 123.10 A: yeah 

124.34 125.20 A: right 

126.63 127.55 A: right 

127.67 141.43 B: [lipsmack] and and it's such a large country that if anything were to happen with them it would be so hard for us to i mean we we could do it obviously we'd win but it would [sigh] it would be ten times worse than what happened in iraq 'cause they're so large 

141.05 142.09 A: right 

142.24 145.83 B: you know but still i do not trust north korea whatsoever 

145.63 146.91 A: yeah 

146.38 149.57 B: [noise] they they make me very [laughter] very nervous 

149.06 152.04 A: do you think they got some hiding places over there 

152.45 156.45 B: i thi- no i think that that i mean they have they've admitted they have nuclear 

156.54 161.04 B: missiles and they've admitted that they have some that can go pretty far 

157.38 158.19 A: (( right right )) 

161.36 170.48 B: so [sigh] i think i'd be worried about [sigh] a retaliation if after this you know george bush decides oh okay you know i i want to take on another 

170.65 174.51 B: person you know and you know rack one more up i believe that 

174.58 176.99 B: iraq needed to be taken care of 

176.56 178.04 A: definitely 

177.57 179.78 B: [lipsmack] and i'm glad that we went in there and 

179.94 187.67 B: people that you know i have a lot of friends that don't think that we should have even gone in there but i say it's it was a 

187.85 189.37 B: he was exactly 

189.58 190.96 B: like a hitler type 

190.87 192.15 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

191.54 193.56 B: and you can't you can't have that 

193.33 202.33 A: i couldn't imagine i was uh looking at the news today and they said they had one of these things with the pins in it that clamp shut on people and it's like yeah okay 

202.21 205.93 B: yeah and they also found some suspect chemicals today as well 

205.34 206.93 A: yeah 

206.30 215.55 B: [noise] and [sigh] i mean i don't i think that this is going to be a warning but i think that it also invites other countries who have that same type type of attitude to challenge us also 

215.29 216.33 A: right 

215.96 217.91 B: and that's what scares me a little bit 

217.66 219.03 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

218.60 224.88 B: you know i never [sigh] i'm not for war but when it happens i'm behind my country [sigh] 

224.27 225.99 A: yeah definitely 

225.35 226.30 B: you know 

226.56 230.62 B: and some of these i've seen some of these people even mothers of uh 

230.90 232.50 B: people um 

232.66 236.11 B: [lipsmack] who are in the service who are protesting against the war 

235.62 236.95 A: (( definitely right )) 

236.33 240.18 B: and i thought to myself how c- how can you do that you know your son or your daughter's over there 

240.75 245.54 B: you know and they've decided to make their life's career in the military and you've started to 

245.56 246.87 B: go against them 

246.60 248.02 A: (( right yeah [laughter] )) 

247.37 249.56 B: it's [laughter] you know 

250.32 252.08 B: i th- i just think that's that's 

252.18 253.43 B: terrible 

253.17 256.77 A: definitely terrible i yeah it it just 

257.09 260.54 A: i don't know they've got a lot of people out there that just say 

260.58 264.31 A: that they're against war but it's not as many as are for the war 

264.58 265.63 B: right 

265.75 272.60 B: right well and also i think a lot of these people a- are somewhat ignorant they don't understand you know they did a a poll 

265.97 266.89 A: and 

272.51 273.41 A: right 

272.81 278.20 B: and a lot of these people you know [mn] they they didn't even know really what was going on 

277.90 279.06 A: right 

278.57 281.11 B: within the war they [mn] 

281.32 288.20 B: they hadn't studied anything you know most of them didn't even watch the news they said oh we don't wanna watch the news 'cause of it's war well that's how you get educated 

287.44 290.19 A: (( right that's how i always get educated most of the time )) 

289.29 291.23 B: (( yeah [sigh] you know )) 

291.52 295.18 B: and they say the news is propaganda well if you go to any other country 

295.78 297.76 B: your news is going to be m- 

296.94 307.16 A: and then they had baghdad bombed oh [laughter] but still after they were in baghdad he's saying they're not here i mean it was like [laughter] 

299.28 300.14 B: yeah 

300.55 301.87 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

304.85 313.20 B: yeah th- th- [laughter] i think that that's ver- that that's very very funny is that you know [mn] bombs can be going off behind him and he's still saying i they're not here 

312.89 315.93 A: (( ah [laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter] i know it )) 

313.40 323.30 B: they're not here [laughter] you know a- as soon as that statue of saddam came down they they they even said uh no it that was uh you know that was from past 

322.98 323.88 A: (( right yeah )) 

323.31 326.15 B: from the nineteen ninety one war they said 

325.70 327.42 A: [laughter] 

326.62 329.99 B: [laughter] which i just think is is absolutely ridiculous 

329.40 344.10 A: yeah well i'd you know i'd you're saying north korea i c- i couldn't understand where you're coming from what you're saying um russia's got i don't think they really have as much but they can be a threat 'cause they've got as many people 

344.37 355.98 B: yeah i i'm i'm worried about them a little bit i'm worried about them siding with with places you know that like bush calls the axis of evil you know w- with iran and with north korea um 

354.62 355.62 A: yeah 

355.87 363.08 B: b- and i'm i'm i was very worried that that after everything that has happened with russia and the united states that they were not behind us 

362.66 363.73 A: right 

363.10 369.94 B: in the war not even they didn't even uh in fact they were way oppo- very opposed they weren't neutral at all 

369.64 370.69 A: right 

370.12 375.48 B: and if they'd stayed neutral i wouldn't have been so worried but the last thing that we need is a cold war again 

375.27 377.17 A: (( yeah tell me about it [noise] [noise] )) 

376.63 383.07 B: [noise] you know because [sigh] i'm young but my parents [sigh] you know went through [noise] the um [lipsmack] 

383.21 388.60 B: cuban missile crisis and you know the bay of pigs and the korean and the world war two even 

388.37 389.38 A: yeah 

388.74 390.17 B: (( and i- i- )) 

390.19 392.31 B: to have that fear again 

392.32 399.08 B: that russia you know but i think that because we've we've been in russia and we've had such relations with russia that 

399.52 404.99 B: i i and because they're so divided now int- into different states where before they were just the soviet union 

404.62 405.72 A: right 

405.56 409.36 B: that i don't think that we could they could get enough backing 

409.19 410.33 A: right 

409.73 412.60 B: you know i live in a predominantly russian neighbourhood 

413.00 422.57 B: [noise] and they're you know i have a lot of my neighbors uh their family still to this day i see [laughter] new family members showing up [laughter] you know from people and i and 

420.16 421.26 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

422.70 426.09 B: th- they tend to have a very um positive attitude 

426.11 432.30 A: yeah they y- you know when they come over here after they come over here and they see such a difference 

429.66 430.22 B: (( [noise] )) 

432.45 435.14 A: um yeah they understand better 

433.02 433.58 B: (( [noise] )) 

434.74 435.92 B: yeah 

435.23 439.27 A: but [noise] when they're over there and they're under one regime and they don't know 

439.70 446.66 A: anything else about any other country and they haven't been educated that's yeah that's where you end up in a lot of trouble [noise] 

446.47 457.64 B: [noise] right and you also end up in a lot of trouble with and the fact that now that they're a democracy maybe the uh you know putin maybe he wants to go to being a dictator type situation 

457.37 458.29 A: right 

458.16 460.19 B: you know and and do y- 

460.47 469.43 B: they were so optimistic about democracy and then their economy you know w- when the when it first hit their economy failed so miserably because they didn't know how to be a democracy 

469.13 470.89 A: right 

470.09 472.81 B: [lipsmack] that now i'm worried that they're going to say well you know 

473.36 475.75 B: [sigh] go back to the way it was 

475.86 476.57 A: yeah 

475.95 482.53 B: and that people will start you know but i i don't know about the rebellion and that of people who have started successful businesses nowadays 

482.34 483.49 A: (( right [noise] )) 

482.87 495.46 B: who would say you know no so you might have i mean i'd say in in a few years you might have sort of people that are on the the you know have more classically minded in thinking of the way it used to be with the communism 

495.38 496.20 A: yeah 

495.59 500.28 B: ah you know the higher officials 'cause they want the control and they don't want the power to the people 

500.07 501.30 A: (( yeah that that's )) 

500.51 503.38 B: and then the people and then you have a a civil war going on
