0.04 1.96 B: hello i'm rodney 

0.77 1.58 A: (( ah )) 

1.72 3.69 A: hi rodney i'm wanda 

3.98 5.16 B: hi wanda 

4.88 5.95 A: [laughter] 

6.89 9.38 A: so we're talking about the middle east today 

7.04 7.86 B: um 

8.58 10.55 B: talking about the middle east 

10.15 14.01 A: [lipsmack] well golly i don't really know much about it 

14.24 16.60 B: okay well do you 

14.90 17.77 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

16.84 19.43 B: do you feel we should be at war or shouldn't be 

19.42 22.20 A: well it sounds like the war is pretty much ending 

21.96 23.89 B: okay i agree 

23.32 25.25 A: yeah um 

25.96 29.87 A: i don't know i don't think we can keep jumping in and saving everybody 

30.60 31.65 A: (( but )) 

32.23 34.16 A: [sigh] oh i don't know 

34.20 35.89 A: you know y- you can't 

36.06 40.38 A: just keep taking over countries and making them do things the way you want 

41.32 45.89 A: but then again it doesn't seem right to sit back and and let 

46.43 48.36 A: you know dictators 

48.19 49.49 B: right 

48.87 51.66 A: ruin the lives of a lot of people either 

51.23 52.43 B: exactly 

52.77 57.26 A: i don't know you know now they're talking about what if we're going to go into 

57.52 60.01 A: you know some other place and it's like ah 

59.39 62.23 B: right they're talking about ah syria 

61.82 64.17 A: right yeah i heard that today 

64.59 66.02 A: and 

66.42 68.66 A: you know how many more are we going to do 

70.67 72.27 B: exactly 

70.81 71.45 A: (( so )) 

72.85 81.02 B: and it's it's such a i think the president is doing a a spectacular job with what he's with what he's dealt 

73.01 73.77 A: (( um )) 

80.72 81.93 A: mhm 

81.37 85.11 B: um but i'm glad it's him and not me 

84.62 85.94 A: [laughter] 

86.41 98.44 B: because i r- honestly don't know what i would do so because i agree in w- on one hand that you know we can't just sit back and let people do whatever they want 

98.46 99.40 B: because 

99.71 112.54 B: eventually you know the whole sep not to you know bring a bunch of stuff down but the whole september eleven thing w- would happen again if we just sat back and let people do what they wanted 

103.40 104.56 A: mhm 

110.38 111.73 A: right 

111.91 117.11 A: but do you think that we ever would have gone in and done anything if they hadn't attacked us first 

117.84 120.96 B: um i'm not sure that's a good question 

119.66 124.04 A: we this whole israel thing this has been going on forever 

123.62 124.89 B: right 

124.27 126.15 A: and we don't touch that 

126.64 130.69 A: and as far as i know we never got involved in ireland's problems 

131.54 135.04 A: so you know how long would we have let this go 

135.94 138.18 A: if they never attacked us 

137.69 139.17 B: mhm 

140.13 141.88 A: i don't know i just 

140.90 142.57 B: that's a good question that's 

142.79 149.15 A: i would just kind of like to see the same amount of money that's spent on us saving other countries 

142.97 143.69 B: (( really good )) 

149.20 151.52 A: spent on people in this country 

150.65 152.62 B: on our own country yes 

152.22 159.47 A: you know or or reduce our taxes either way [laughter] you know it's just there are people here with big problems too 

154.45 155.50 B: right 

159.70 167.42 A: and instead we're setting aside billions of dollars to help out other countries that don't want us there and don't care about us 

168.12 170.59 A: and it just doesn't seem quite right 

170.12 171.28 B: i agree 

171.30 173.88 B: i agree but like i said it's a difficult 

175.09 179.89 B: thing to do i mean i think like being a parent i mean i'm not a parent but i know 

176.24 177.38 A: right 

179.93 180.96 B: that it's 

181.13 186.54 B: you know you get so many different options to do and there's really no manual for it [laughter] 

186.04 189.30 A: right and i you know i think there's probably 

189.64 192.68 A: a lot of information that we never hear 

192.37 193.69 B: exactly 

193.09 196.22 A: you know there are things going on that 

196.58 200.64 A: only the people at the top you know have any inkling of 

200.34 201.74 B: right 

201.12 203.54 A: and that probably makes a difference 

203.14 204.66 B: yes very much very much 

205.75 207.60 A: so [sigh] huh 

206.78 209.57 B: well do you know anybody that is over there or 

209.08 210.08 A: nope 

209.89 211.07 B: nope 

210.92 212.78 A: which i think you know makes it 

212.99 215.15 A: pretty impersonal for me 

215.25 216.70 B: yes probably so 

215.58 230.46 A: and then being so far from new york i i think that a lot of what happened on september eleventh is just like you know a a t._v. story [laughter] you know it's not quite as real as as for people who are in that area 

224.74 226.03 B: mhm 

227.28 228.37 B: right 

229.89 232.25 B: exactly may i ask what state you're 

231.78 233.15 A: i'm in wisconsin 

232.72 235.16 B: wisconsin okay i'm in california 

233.38 234.21 A: yep 

234.89 246.09 A: yeah i keep getting california late at night i think 'cause there's probably not a lot of mid western people who said oh yeah call me till midnight [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

236.26 237.39 B: [laughter] 

241.47 244.93 B: [laughter] it's probably the case yes [laughter] 

245.08 246.59 B: that's probably the case 

246.12 253.02 A: so being more cut off from from new york i i i think it you know it's not as personal you don't really 

252.75 253.86 B: right 

253.25 264.40 A: feel it the same way i've talked to friends who you know lived within sight of the world trade center who are are really affected by it and it's like okay fine whatever you know 

264.81 271.65 B: yeah yeah it feels like it's uh i agree that it's almost like watching a movie instead of it being 

271.71 272.60 B: um 

272.61 275.34 B: anything and especially the way which 

275.48 282.37 B: in one hand i really like the fact of now that we have all of these reporters embedded in with the troops 

282.14 283.20 A: right 

282.49 294.61 B: so it gives us a picture for history and you know so that we can kind of see what's going on and everything but we see so much of it that it doesn't seem as much like as it's 

295.23 299.56 B: a really big issue i mean it is a big issue but it just seems like 

298.08 298.93 A: (( mm )) 

299.57 306.62 B: you know well now they started taking it off but the first week there you know every channel that you turned it was on and there was 

306.24 307.37 A: right 

306.86 307.67 B: you know 

307.74 314.53 B: twenty thousand reporters in with the troops and it just didn't seem 

314.93 317.03 B: as like you said a- as a 

317.32 318.72 B: surreal i guess 

318.50 322.69 A: right i think that like the movie you watch uh saving private ryan 

322.37 323.22 B: mhm 

322.83 326.33 A: you wa- i watched that and it made 

326.31 338.19 A: you know the whole pain of of war and the danger and what people went through it all seemed so real and yet i don't even get that from these people who are in the middle of the battle [laughter] 

337.62 338.50 B: right 

338.50 345.96 A: you know it's just i don't know if they're just cleaning it up for us probably you know they're not showing us the the the gritty kind of stuff 

345.91 347.14 B: exactly 

346.56 357.08 A: and um i don't know if you were you know how old you were during the whole vietnam thing but we used to hear more about how many people died 

356.70 358.03 B: mhm 

357.39 364.31 A: you know and here this time it seems like occasionally you'd hear okay something happened here and a couple of people died 

364.35 368.48 A: and maybe if some of them had been local i would have heard more about it too but 

367.90 369.19 B: right 

368.56 370.98 A: it was just like it was glossed over 

370.97 372.31 B: exactly 

371.72 373.44 A: and i don't know 

372.46 384.95 B: and then for me it's not so much of the case for in that aspect because i i was in the military um i'm pretty young i'm twenty three um i'll have a birthday here soon 

382.49 383.45 A: wow 

384.58 385.53 A: (( yay )) 

385.08 386.40 B: um [laughter] 

385.71 386.80 A: [laughter] 

386.50 388.70 B: but i have a lot of my friends 

388.81 390.86 B: who are actually over there right now 

390.74 392.50 A: oh so it's personal for you 

392.24 394.38 B: exactly um 

394.54 400.06 B: and i live really close to uh to the base here so it's 

400.17 404.43 B: very much in the news um just our local news 

403.84 405.37 A: mhm 

404.79 408.85 B: um where it's san diego is the uh port 

408.27 411.75 A: oh yeah yeah you've got a lot of military there 

409.24 410.71 B: so there's a lot of 

411.35 412.92 B: (( exactly um )) 

412.28 416.39 A: right yeah here in wisconsin not so much you know [laughter] 

414.94 419.97 B: right right exactly yeah i grew up in louisiana so i can can fully understand 

418.22 420.14 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

420.06 423.20 B: i joined the marines 'cause i didn't know any marine [laughter] 

422.10 427.06 A: [laughter] be the first in your crowd [laughter] 

425.13 426.33 B: exactly 

426.48 434.08 B: um so yeah i i have on you know i can think in terms of i've seen 

435.12 444.68 B: the information that we the guys get and what they're dealt they're dealt with and i know the situation that they're in but i don't really agree with what they're in 

444.24 445.41 A: mhm 

444.70 446.46 B: you know because i don't 

446.60 447.64 B: (( you know )) 

447.86 457.82 A: well maybe as somebody in the military you can give me a perspective on this we had news stories about you know oh what happens to the kids when mom and dad go to war 

457.74 466.93 A: and my feeling was before mom and dad got sent to before they had kids they should have thought about what's going to happen if they have go to war 

462.44 463.31 B: mhm 

466.67 467.76 B: right 

467.15 473.46 A: and i i was having a real hard time feeling sorry for these military families that had to leave their children behind 

473.01 474.33 B: mhm 

473.94 479.70 A: it's like don't don't people in the milit- i mean if you're in the military both the husband and the wife 

480.19 485.41 A: you mean don't you have to give some thought to the possibility that it's not always going to be peace time 

485.48 495.76 B: i agree um i myself like i said i'm we do not i'm married and no we do not have a- any children yet um but i waited i got married while i was in 

486.24 487.88 A: [laughter] 

495.47 496.53 A: mhm 

495.68 502.50 B: um but i'm now out i just did my four years and but i kind of look at that as maybe being in the poli- on the police force 

502.53 503.56 A: right 

502.86 503.95 B: um 

504.00 507.15 B: because on a normal day to day basis 

507.52 512.26 B: you you know how often when's the last time that we've actually been had any really 

512.26 524.05 B: dealings the most people are joining the military i mean and myself included are joining the military because of the benefits because of going to school and it's a stepping stone in life 

516.73 517.77 A: mhm 

522.08 523.10 A: right 

523.66 528.96 A: and never even thinking about the possibility that you might have to actually fight a war 

525.92 526.99 B: right 

528.44 532.87 B: exactly i i think a lot of people think about it but 

529.58 530.82 A: (( i think that )) 

531.64 532.88 A: mhm 

532.90 535.78 B: they don't really plan as much for it 

535.19 543.61 A: yeah it could be an age thing you know because being old enough to i was in my t- you know early teens during the vietnam thing 

541.73 542.59 B: mhm 

543.60 549.47 A: and so i remember the selective service i remember you know boys being drafted 

546.19 547.38 B: right 

549.40 558.88 A: and i i think that gives you a little bit of a different view on it because you know they're being taken from their families and they're being put into war 

553.80 554.73 B: mhm 

558.49 559.64 B: right 

559.04 565.39 A: so you know i see the military as you know think about it because you could get killed [laughter] 

564.68 566.21 B: exactly 

565.77 568.36 A: yeah yeah i can see now where 

568.91 573.46 A: you know these days where where it has been peaceful for so long 

573.88 579.33 A: you know it just seems like a a you know a good way to go and and get your education paid for and stuff 

579.04 581.27 B: very much very much and 

579.70 591.01 A: yeah i even you know i have friends who who say well ah one in particular who said she told her son that when he gets out of high school he's either going to college or he's joining the military and that's like 

590.89 595.37 A: you know they they don't even see it as i might be sending him off to be killed [laughter] 

594.75 596.40 B: right 

596.19 597.53 A: gee 

596.52 599.89 B: and al- although in that i know the flip side
