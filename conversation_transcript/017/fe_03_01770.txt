1.02 2.16 A: hello 

1.76 2.85 B: hello 

2.70 4.54 A: hi i'm moira 

3.51 4.98 B: hi my name is bill 

4.92 5.74 A: hi 

6.83 9.63 A: so [laughter] 

9.72 11.69 A: after you subject 

11.20 13.64 B: um yeah and rather topical 

13.39 16.88 A: [laughter] yeah um 

17.94 20.68 A: do you consider any countries a threat to the u._s. 

21.96 23.68 B: um yes 

23.90 27.39 B: i believe um i believe north korea is 

28.77 30.19 A: yeah 

30.09 34.43 B: reason being is i think they're a desperate country that 

35.04 39.40 B: needs a lot of things and they wouldn't be adverse to 

39.53 41.20 B: selling or 

41.52 46.13 B: bribing or doing whatever is necessary in order in order to get the 

46.49 50.06 B: um money that that they need 

51.15 56.52 B: and i think desperate people do desperate things and desperate countries are no different than desperate people 

56.50 57.50 A: yep 

57.50 59.44 B: what are what are your thoughts 

59.58 60.14 B: (( [cough] )) 

59.65 61.52 A: i'd have to agree with you on 

61.89 63.40 A: (( north korea i i )) 

63.47 67.15 A: can't say that i'm very well versed in 

67.28 69.68 A: much of this topic but um 

71.25 78.41 A: but i definitely just the fact that north korea is sort of standing out there like 

78.42 82.30 A: hey we have all these weapons look at us [laughter] please 

80.86 81.86 B: mhm 

82.15 83.70 B: i i i 

82.87 85.57 A: and so they definitely want to get something from it yeah 

85.93 94.00 B: i agree with you in the fact that i don't feel i don't feel versed enough to to take a stand or 

94.17 99.16 B: because i don't really feel like our media is giving us enough information 

99.41 103.92 B: and and the other side of it is that this whole north korean issue 

103.98 105.99 B: just burst on the scene 

106.16 107.26 B: um 

107.35 116.15 B: as a result of september eleventh but um there were a number of documentaries that i've seen recently on on cinemax 

109.54 110.38 A: yeah 

116.15 127.00 B: and one was from the b._b._c. where they've sent people to north korea um and to do a documentary about health care and so forth and it's 

127.37 133.68 B: it's such a depressing country they've got all the mausoleums and all the big wonderful buildings that were built by 

133.90 143.65 B: the the um the leaders there but there's no humanity there's no people to populate these and it's it's just so desperate that 

143.64 150.19 B: you can picture that if weapons are the only way that he could use in order to make money 

150.32 157.83 B: um they're going to because there's nothing else that they have to offer the world at least that they think that they don't have to offer the world 

156.27 157.25 A: right 

157.88 162.25 B: which is really that's a desperate that's that's really bad to be put in that position 

162.98 168.10 B: no basically almost no different than a family who has no way of making a living 

168.14 174.30 B: and yet trying to survive you know they would turn to crime or do whatever is necessary in order to 

174.33 175.89 B: to feed the family 

175.78 180.23 A: yes it's really sad that's like like 'cause there's the talks that are coming up 

180.80 182.60 A: pretty soon between 

182.76 187.34 A: i think north korea and south korea and japan right and the u._s. 

187.69 190.13 B: do you feel do you feel that 

190.68 200.44 B: with our administration our current administration in america that diplomatically we are strong to be able to deal with this problem with korea 

201.62 205.91 A: not really [laughter] that's sort of scarring me 

205.34 207.89 B: [laughter] that's that's my concern 

206.66 213.26 A: yeah i guess yeah i mean i get very concerned about the same thing that we just put such an image out there of 

213.82 223.56 A: we're trying to save the world but [laughter] i mean we're already stretched so thin and putting ourselves out there in so many other parts of the world it's like 

223.96 228.17 A: we can't do everything and we can't um 

228.20 229.25 A: solve 

229.77 234.17 A: all the problems and then when there's something that is a really big threat 

234.29 236.01 A: it's like we can 

234.45 235.41 B: (( yeah )) 

236.11 239.69 A: accomplish that along with a million other things and it just 

239.45 243.36 B: and it's scary to go it alone because that's sort of what's what's happening 

243.15 244.55 A: yeah 

244.04 245.19 B: i mean 

245.72 247.21 B: it's always nice 

245.91 247.02 A: and it's like that 

247.38 248.46 A: we 

248.59 258.62 A: don't go along with the u._n. and then making that making the u._n. seem like it doesn't matter as much any more it seems so dangerous to me as well because 

259.45 267.53 A: then that could just lead to sort of nobody trusting any inner sort of international body that could govern over everyone 

267.45 269.55 B: that yeah i agree it's um 

269.85 272.64 B: from a diplomatic standpoint 

272.94 276.56 B: i don't think that we have the diplomacy 

276.56 286.85 B: or or the desire to be diplomatic um we're more we're more force oriented and here we're dealing with a country that 

286.84 297.36 B: definitely needs to be dealt with diplomatically because we're stretched so thin that we couldn't afford to be able to to engage 

297.63 299.40 B: in a problem over there 

299.73 310.98 B: and the other thing is the whole question was do we think that there's another country you know that that can cause us problems just watching the news tonight i mean it's not over in iraq 

311.11 313.70 B: watching a million people 

314.45 324.49 B: gathering in the streets wanting the americans out of their country i mean isn't isn't that another problem that could possibly brew that nobody was thinking about 

318.57 319.49 A: (( right yeah )) 

324.60 327.39 B: um it's it's it's really scary 

327.31 329.84 A: i was reading an article about 

330.02 343.48 A: just sort of like the the past of when the u._s. or britain has gone into a country and then how long it's taken them to get out of that country and it was sort of [laughter] 

343.43 346.92 A: and it was like in most of them it was 

347.28 348.88 A: almost a decade 

350.20 354.20 A: and the the country becomes like very dependent on 

354.36 355.41 A: the u._s. 

356.02 363.41 A: and it's like you need to strike a balance between helping them and not making them become too dependent on you but 

363.81 367.72 A: right now it doesn't even seem like a lot of people want us there at all so [laughter] 

367.30 371.40 B: no it's um in fact as the the 

371.56 375.73 B: developments that have occurred in the past couple of days with all of the 

375.76 380.44 B: um the mass marches and everything in into kabala 

380.42 392.73 B: it's it's extremely scary because it really just echoes the entire problem over there in the middle east it's not just that one country i mean we saw the same thing happen in iran 

392.77 395.49 B: um and and elsewhere 

395.56 407.65 B: and it's not the answers aren't coming from the west because i don't think that our leaders understand any more than i understand 

407.77 412.77 B: that culture which is which is so foreign to the western way of thinking 

411.45 412.45 A: yeah 

412.78 413.96 A: definitely 

414.10 415.73 B: and they do need 

415.06 420.85 A: that's the whole idea of how things should be run is so different from ours and we go in there saying oh you know we want 

420.74 433.10 A: the democratic process or whatever but forcing democracy on people is although it would be nice [laughter] it sort of goes against the grain of the whole idea of it in the first place 

432.73 437.68 B: ah with my with my friends when when the the berlin wall fell 

437.68 450.28 B: um all of the talk and everything turned to to that topic but now years later you know the imposing of democracy on to russia the way it was done 

439.97 440.75 A: right 

450.36 452.52 B: was really so wrong 

452.83 463.56 B: because what it did is it brought up all of the elements that were being held at bay by the government and that being the mob scene and and 

463.71 471.06 B: the organized crime angle that took over a lot of russia ah if it could be implemented 

471.16 475.30 B: more structurally over a period of time 

475.64 482.68 B: so that that could be controlled i think it would be a better way to introduce democracy into 

482.74 483.84 B: um 

484.84 490.45 B: without the chaos that that seemed to be the problem when that was what i was looking for 

486.91 487.68 A: (( yes )) 

490.74 497.17 B: iraq is in chaos because we took everything away before we've implemented the democracy the same thing happened in russia 

496.80 503.83 A: chaos and so much of a problem is also just the education of the people who live there because they just really don't have any and um 

504.16 507.89 A: and um you get worried that if you give 

508.04 510.98 A: like if you say democracy is sort of like you know 

511.25 514.05 A: like one vote per person and then you have like a 

514.23 523.76 A: a big minority that would like to have a voice that they'll get completely left out because there are a different like very different ethnic groups within iraq also 

523.43 524.78 B: right 

524.48 525.58 A: and i 

525.72 526.68 A: (( mean )) 

527.41 532.82 A: just the fact that there's like no education for the children and then they grow up to be that way 

532.80 544.19 B: well i i couldn't understand all the time that we were hearing you know about the reason that we should be going into iraq and that we were hearing that the iraqi people want liberation 

544.18 549.48 B: but at the same time they said that the average age of an iraqi is twenty five years old 

549.91 553.43 B: and saddam hussein has been in power for thirty years 

553.63 559.94 B: well that means that the majority of their population doesn't know anything about democracy 

559.51 560.71 A: right 

560.12 563.37 B: so it goes back to what you were saying about education 

563.47 569.64 B: how could somebody want something that they're not even educated in to even know about or understand 

568.93 570.07 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

569.49 579.41 B: and and that's what we're seeing now is that they might choose to embrace it much more rapidly if they were more educated to understand what 

573.79 574.58 A: (( right )) 

579.43 582.71 B: you know what it all involves and i think you know it's taken 

583.22 593.55 B: two decades or so and russia is finally coming around ah to being able to control the the mobs and the um um when i say the mob it is the organized crime 

593.66 599.95 B: um very much like the american like america had in the twenties um they've
