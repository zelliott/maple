0.75 1.94 B: hi 

1.66 2.81 A: hi 

3.21 4.79 B: my name is yobish 

4.78 6.77 A: hi i'm carol blakely 

6.85 7.95 B: hi carol 

8.85 10.73 B: ah it's nice talking to you today 

10.36 11.79 A: nice talking to you 

13.20 14.80 B: (( so ah )) 

15.22 20.96 A: i guess the question is whether we think there's any other country that's a threat to the united states 

21.38 23.34 B: yeah that's right 

23.98 25.45 B: (( and ah )) 

25.57 27.18 B: what do you think 

28.47 32.04 A: well i'm not sure what they meant by any other country but um 

32.81 37.79 A: if they're talking about any other country other than iraq or any other country other than 

37.84 42.23 A: north korea or you know other um countries that have been in the news lately 

42.51 43.42 A: um 

44.34 48.15 A: and i don't really know i mean i haven't really thought 

48.31 49.43 A: about 

49.45 52.20 A: i guess threats to the united states 

52.61 59.28 A: but it seems to me that there are probably a lot of people in the world that are um 

59.20 68.04 A: not particularly enthralled with the united states in general so i probably have to say there probably are other countries that may hold threats 

68.11 72.23 B: ah actually i think ah otherwise this 

72.34 78.68 B: the question is probably not ah which country but ah probably the way we have 

79.54 87.48 B: seen the analysis of terrorism the analysis of you know posing threat how the matter matters they are using 

88.04 90.73 B: it's more about which organisation 

91.84 93.10 B: is a threat 

92.14 93.99 A: rather than a country 

93.46 95.83 B: rather than a country because 

94.15 96.53 A: mhm that's probably you are probably right 

95.92 98.18 B: these organizations are truly 

98.50 99.67 B: like global 

99.63 100.74 A: mhm 

99.69 105.72 B: as as many culprits are so they they work in the same manner they don't have a country and 

104.94 107.80 A: not particularly a country yeah you are probably right 

105.92 107.22 B: (( and )) 

107.31 115.18 B: diplomatically no country is probably going to say okay we are anti america or or any other country for that matter 

112.22 113.33 A: mhm 

114.83 115.80 A: mhm 

115.67 118.73 B: even if even if they have like a long going 

119.77 123.84 B: you know ah conflict with a neighboring country then that was fate that's okay we are 

123.36 134.93 A: yep no you are probably right i'm sure they are probably just maybe factions in a country and i unfortunately i guess people sometimes tend to generalize that it's everybody when it really isn't 

130.94 131.93 B: yeah 

132.72 143.29 B: yeah yeah yeah the freedom of ah individual in most countries have in peace so much that ah you don't really necessarily have to 

143.41 144.69 B: (( relate ah )) 

144.82 149.41 B: relate ah you know and you just tendency to be anti 

150.12 157.61 B: any country to that country itself in fact it could be just a lot of the country like we seen in the case of iraq it does not 

152.75 153.61 A: mhm 

157.34 158.27 A: right 

157.73 162.62 B: now the you know the real thing is not iraq we are not against iraq we are against the rulers 

160.43 161.28 A: no 

161.39 162.24 A: no 

162.39 163.34 A: (( yep )) 

162.78 163.62 B: right 

163.35 168.46 A: well that's true and his people that are you know with him but 

169.10 171.36 A: i don't know it seems that even 

171.88 173.27 A: with um 

173.80 175.54 A: him once 

175.64 181.22 A: he's not around any more there are many people that have also decided that they are not really 

181.91 186.12 A: in favor of what he did anyway and kind of a- abandoned ship so to speak 

186.06 187.34 B: (( that's right )) 

186.61 187.87 A: yeah 

188.13 196.71 B: yeah so in that manner we can say ah there's a ruler in in north korea which is not really not really interested in you 

193.83 194.96 A: mhm 

196.97 198.31 B: (( know coming )) 

198.31 207.59 B: on terms and not sitting on sitting on table to discuss the issues with the arms flags and everything with the united states so 

203.60 204.53 A: mhm 

207.55 214.06 B: we can say probably that's one ruler that's a threat to the united states not that country 

213.40 216.71 A: yep no you're absolutely right yep i think that's a good point 

216.31 217.36 B: yeah 

217.52 220.21 A: but um yeah it tends to 

218.02 218.80 B: and 

220.52 231.05 A: people tend to generalize i guess or when they talk about it it's not necessarily the ruler but the whole country's brought into it and i'm sure that probably is not true 

228.94 233.22 B: no i no no it's not true in any country i mean 

233.99 234.91 B: (( ah [mn] )) 

236.82 242.60 B: probably then the next question probably would be that any religion which is against ah against 

242.73 247.77 B: particular vision and that would be i mean this is kind of the wrong question to pose so 

248.21 249.99 B: so i think ah 

250.02 260.41 B: yeah that's one ruler and then there are some other rulers which are um kind of which have been kind of opposed to the united states policies and you know intervention 

260.12 261.04 A: (( mhm right )) 

260.81 264.98 B: (( ah very cowardly and they still are in power )) 

264.96 265.88 A: (( yeah )) 

265.23 271.42 B: but those countries are not ah you know part of the threat to the united states 

271.05 271.91 A: no 

271.89 276.56 B: only those countries where there is official policy 

276.66 281.44 B: by a certain you know government ruled by individual to 

277.38 278.30 A: mhm 

279.38 280.24 A: right 

281.09 282.44 A: yeah and it's too 

281.50 282.46 B: support 

282.51 284.46 A: i think um too 

285.58 287.79 A: a lot of the reason that um 

288.29 296.98 A: people sometimes tend to make generalizations like i did sometimes are the reason is that they just um 

291.76 292.89 B: mhm 

293.36 293.92 B: (( [mn] )) 

297.08 302.89 A: they are not that familiar with unfortunately other cultures other than the united states but um 

303.10 311.91 A: you know i have travelled some not to um the middle east but to some countries um other than you know around in the united states and 

305.35 306.61 B: (( ah ahah )) 

311.92 313.78 A: it is it's very ah 

313.88 315.72 A: i think the 

316.25 330.62 A: kind of feeling you get when you are in a country is very different than the feelings that you might have talking about it or reading what is published in american newspapers or journals or magazines or on the news um that's a very different perspective 

327.55 328.60 B: mhm 

330.59 334.47 B: yes that's right so what you know what country did you travel to 

334.36 346.89 A: i've been to i was in japan for a while and my daughter travelled in um well actually she has been in the middle east she was in israel and um she was there for about six months and travelled around um 

337.43 338.29 B: uh-huh 

347.91 351.97 A: [lipsmack] well she didn't go really too much further she went into italy um 

351.07 352.03 B: (( i see )) 

351.99 357.06 A: greece and around in there um just briefly but she spent most of her time 

352.86 353.79 B: uh-huh 

355.64 357.74 B: [mn] yeah and some 

357.07 372.06 A: in israel and even there she said too she said it was never she now this was three years ago she said she never felt as much in danger as she was led to believe when she was in the united states that she may be i mean you heard things and you had to be careful 

371.30 379.59 B: see that's another thing which i which i think i'm from india and when i travel to a country like her you know i was in oman 

372.23 373.13 A: (( yeah )) 

374.66 375.54 A: mhm 

379.33 380.45 A: mhm 

379.84 386.95 B: and when i travel to a country like that i although i am not a christian i'm not a u._s. citizen i am from india i am a hindu 

386.55 387.50 A: mhm 

387.07 391.68 B: but probably i think ah that israel is very hostile i 

392.20 393.34 A: israel 

393.44 405.49 B: mean for no good reason i mean i don't have any- anything to to believe because i am from a certain country or i'm because of my religion they are against me i think it's just about the way the people or they behave 

394.84 395.68 A: yeah 

396.50 397.37 A: right 

404.83 405.85 A: yeah 

405.25 412.99 B: we don't have to a- assume it's just because you are christian or you are from the united states that's what they are doing it it's just ah nature you 

409.23 410.12 A: no 

410.32 411.19 A: no 

412.29 415.98 A: yeah yeah it can be it's very very different 

413.48 417.33 B: know so you have to just accept them accept them the way they 

417.03 419.57 A: yeah but she never felt i guess 

419.61 431.04 A: that she was in jeopardy let's put it that way you you didn't go certain places at certain times and you had to be careful but it wasn't as though she felt threatened put it that way 

421.94 424.30 B: are yeah yeah that's right 

429.29 430.49 B: mhm 

431.23 433.55 A: but yeah i know it is it's a 

431.25 432.30 B: yeah 

433.57 435.70 A: you know and again it's a very um 

436.01 438.59 A: kind of cultural thing i think too for her 

437.74 439.34 B: (( exactly exactly )) 

438.70 444.40 A: yeah she she you know she said in the united states you are used to when you walk down the sidewalk you get 

444.34 456.60 A: out of the way of the people that are coming toward you you know everybody walks kind of on their side and she said there it was you know people go wherever they wanted to go whether it was right right down the middle or what and if you are in the way [laughter] too bad 

452.88 454.45 B: exactly exactly 

455.10 456.22 B: [laughter] 

456.47 460.80 B: yeah yeah yeah but ah nobody minds i mean you 

457.76 458.54 A: so 

460.84 468.60 B: i mean that happens [laughter] and that's the way that country is and that country has been for maybe last two hundred three hundred years 

461.76 463.45 A: uh-huh exactly 

464.01 465.31 A: exactly 

466.18 466.97 A: (( yep )) 

467.93 469.25 A: mhm 

468.81 477.64 B: so you cannot just ah keep go keep go go out go out and tell them this is not the right way to behave [laughter] you cannot do that 

469.30 470.56 A: absolutely 

474.65 476.62 A: no it's you know no 

476.85 477.68 A: no 

478.04 478.95 A: nope 

478.15 480.01 B: (( so i )) 

480.37 482.40 B: (( don't know what ah else )) 

483.25 488.43 A: no i think we have kind of covered it as far as i am concerned but i think your points are well taken 

488.71 489.73 A: and ah 

490.10 495.83 A: it is an interesting an interesting question that's for sure sometimes i think too the the reason 

496.01 496.83 B: (( ahah )) 

496.94 497.83 A: (( that )) 

498.13 511.42 A: well you hear so much more about it because everything is so much more open and communication is so much more rapid than it used to be i mean maybe hear about things that would be not instantaneous and now you can get on the internet or 

505.21 506.41 B: exactly 

508.60 509.56 B: yeah 

511.41 514.68 A: whatever and see things as they are happening 

512.78 513.66 B: uh-huh 

514.40 515.33 B: uh-huh 

514.90 519.76 A: so it's certainly much more up front than it has been in the past 

519.14 520.17 B: yeah 

520.59 521.67 B: that's right 

521.35 522.85 A: yeah have you been 

522.00 522.74 B: what 

522.94 524.57 A: i'm sorry go ahead 

523.96 529.38 B: pardon me yeah i was going to ask you about what do you think about what happened in afghanistan 

531.27 533.04 A: in in reference to what 

533.01 538.95 B: in reference to the american action there and ah the freedom and ah the change of regime 

539.31 540.78 B: (( and ah )) 

541.39 542.26 B: you know 

542.07 543.15 A: yeah 

542.58 545.43 B: (( following developments change of ah you know )) 

545.31 546.35 A: how about you 

547.18 548.86 B: (( well i think ah )) 

549.91 552.73 B: it's still ah kind of a good ah 

554.22 563.12 B: observation i mean i mean ah we still have to learn because afghanistan has been a country in turmoil since last hundred years 

555.12 555.93 A: mm 

561.95 563.73 A: (( [mn] exactly )) 

563.52 566.96 B: and ah we had to see and ah you know 

567.56 572.35 B: take lessons that how much intervention of of 

573.06 583.29 B: intervention of the military and you know economical and all sorts of interventions from an from a developed country where u._s._a. can effect and can really help that country 

579.23 580.47 A: what you can do 

582.87 583.90 A: yeah 

583.69 594.72 B: and can it really can work that country now into a country that supports not the u- united states i would not say that supports you know the democratic ah ah you know 

591.26 592.15 A: no 

594.84 597.49 B: ah agenda in that country 

596.19 597.91 A: that they can run on their own 

597.67 599.89 B: yeah yeah so 

599.20 599.89 A: no
