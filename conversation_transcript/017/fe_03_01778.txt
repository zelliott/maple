0.08 3.15 A: hi my name's steve 

1.41 3.38 B: hi my name's lisa 

3.54 4.71 A: hello lisa 

5.09 13.40 A: let's see okay so apparently we're supposed to be talking about what countries we think are ah possible threats to the u._s. 

12.79 14.35 B: yeah 

14.02 15.94 A: what do you think 

16.38 18.15 A: do you think any countries are 

19.64 24.29 B: oh of course i'd much prefer to be able to say no everybody likes us 

20.81 21.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

24.33 27.22 B: but ah we all know that's not true 

26.93 28.77 A: mhm 

28.10 30.09 B: (( um but )) 

32.59 35.85 B: who who who dislikes us enough to be a threat 

36.37 38.74 B: um mm [sigh] 

44.67 46.09 B: (( i'm )) 

46.80 48.89 B: i'm not really sure ah ah 

51.67 53.08 A: well let's see 

53.78 59.17 A: if i had to i'd say yeah we probably have you know some countries that are threats to us 

59.48 68.98 A: i'd say the u._s. is probably the top dog i mean we've got great intelligence and great ah military powers and stuff like that 

62.98 63.78 B: (( oh yeah )) 

69.13 81.40 A: let's see i'd say the people who are the most the threat to us are probably not the ones we see on t._v. i mean we pretty much crushed iraq and they didn't have any offensive capability towards us i 

80.74 81.97 B: yeah 

81.67 83.90 A: mean being that you know the next 

83.95 93.03 A: i don't think the worst that we're we're going to be fighting is the u._s. are going to be on u._s. soil so i'm not sure what like a threat would be like a threat to our imperialism or a threat to like 

92.99 99.36 A: our oil supplies or a threat to you know our economic control on world markets or 

99.48 102.23 A: i don't know i'm not sure what a threat would be 

102.95 106.79 A: i mean since since we're pretty much on the top of a lot of lists 

106.83 112.19 A: of ah things that that are to be controlled just about anybody could be a threat 

112.14 117.35 B: let's face it they're there are places that are going to dislike us simply because 

117.38 118.18 B: (( ah )) 

119.74 122.31 B: you know we represent what they aren't 

122.94 124.52 B: (( and ah )) 

128.57 135.25 B: and they say a lot of people don't like well people who are different [laughter] 

135.22 137.52 A: i'd agree with that 

137.19 138.81 B: and um 

140.02 143.88 B: i i who do you think dislikes the u._s. the most 

144.36 145.67 A: let's see 

145.83 148.47 A: who dislikes the u._s. the most 

148.57 149.80 A: um 

151.48 152.88 A: (( let's see )) 

151.77 152.80 B: (( yeah you know )) 

153.26 157.15 B: you don't have to pick a single we're we're trying to come up with 

157.45 167.01 A: i'm i'm trying to i'm trying to think of a country that we just keep on dogging oh yeah ah let's see i'd probably say lebanon 

167.55 170.89 A: yeah i think i'd probably say lebanon dislikes us the most 

170.64 174.70 B: (( mhm lebanon ah probably got [noise] )) 

171.25 172.91 A: because of our 

175.41 177.67 B: my husband just added syria 

177.09 179.19 A: oh yeah definitely syria 

178.80 181.92 B: [laughter] yeah ah 

182.88 186.08 B: but you know i'd say i'd say we're probably ah 

188.33 195.80 B: got all subjects on that sorts of nasty little ah things written in the corners alongside our name on their list ah 

196.71 197.91 B: um 

199.44 201.54 B: let's see who else 

201.63 205.17 A: um maybe cambodia because we 

202.27 203.27 B: um 

205.26 216.53 A: let pol pot kill i don't know ah i think like nearly two million of their own of their own people and didn't say anything or do anything about it when we claimed to be pretty righteous 

216.62 218.37 A: about human rights 

216.89 221.67 B: yeah you you see they'd ha- hold a grudge about that i would 

221.05 224.49 A: i'm not i don't think there's anybody left to hold a grudge [laughter] 

223.49 225.08 B: [laughter] 

225.34 227.49 A: i think they took care of it 

228.95 230.66 B: ah um 

231.37 232.64 B: let's see 

233.60 234.92 B: um 

236.81 237.48 B: (( you )) 

237.49 241.58 B: know probably people here that we don't even you know really think about 

241.84 243.06 B: um 

244.77 245.97 B: let's see 

250.83 251.75 B: well ah 

254.98 257.31 B: there's there's little standards you know 

257.13 259.04 A: mhm 

257.32 259.89 B: ah cuba still doesn't like us 

260.27 264.26 A: yeah and they were aided by russia to get those nuclear arms so 

260.63 261.38 B: ah 

264.57 266.71 A: russia surely doesn't like us 

268.28 277.45 A: and ah i doubt the ah i doubt china likes us they've been building up the largest standing army for ah a long time and there's still a 

277.73 285.93 A: a communist country that's calling themselves a social democracy or something like that just because the u._s. is 

285.99 288.02 A: over there causing problems 

288.67 289.83 A: um 

290.12 292.58 A: let's see who else do we threaten 

293.96 297.13 A: well maybe yeah 

294.29 294.83 B: (( ah )) 

295.16 297.78 B: oh north north korea still doesn't like us 

297.71 300.96 A: yeah they they i don't think they like anybody 

300.96 302.17 B: yeah 

301.65 308.52 A: i don't think they like anybody but north korea they don't they don't even like south korea they hate south korea ah 

309.38 310.95 A: i don't think anybody is 

311.17 320.65 A: much of a threat like maybe like some rogue terrorist groups or something like that if they had lots of funding could do something but 

317.22 317.93 B: (( yes )) 

319.21 322.91 B: the rogue terrorist group is what would worry me 

323.03 324.11 B: um 

324.81 329.36 A: i'd say the the largest threat to the u._s. is probably the u._s. 

330.69 334.00 A: i think that we could do the most damage to ourselves 

333.31 337.49 B: mm mm the old the old pogo we haven't met the enemy and he is us 

334.02 335.22 A: like 

337.11 345.94 A: right right because we can i'd see like the next war being fought on u._s. soil is probably not going to be from foreign troops 

346.36 348.82 A: i imagine it would be a civil war if anything 

349.14 350.88 B: oh man 

352.37 355.86 B: i i hope that's going to be after our time [laughter] 

354.80 364.63 A: oh yeah i don't the u._s. is is still a pretty young country i think it's like less than four hundred years old at this point and everybody else has been 

364.43 370.97 A: you know they've had their lands conquered and just been changing names for a while but they have been pretty much the same countries 

370.29 374.11 B: yeah but you'll notice though that ah that what we learned about 

374.57 378.40 B: the we we had to memorize countries of the world back in 

378.41 383.15 B: high school ah these names are not what we hear on the news any more [laughter] 

383.02 389.64 A: yeah they've changed like i don't even know what they call zaire nowadays i think it's like republic of the congo 

389.85 391.36 A: or something like 

392.00 394.93 B: i know i know a bunch of stuff in in 

392.07 393.46 A: (( that )) 

394.98 397.54 B: africa has changed names and of course 

396.99 401.93 A: yeah like i think sri lanka is now called like chamboo or something like that i don't know 

403.25 405.93 B: (( i i don't think chamboo is right [laughter] )) 

405.24 410.09 A: well whatever it is whatever it was it was something that probably sounded like that 

406.18 407.83 B: [laughter] 

409.53 413.41 B: [cough] and then of course you know what with ah 

414.20 420.50 B: ah the soviet union all that when it dissolved and it everyone you know slid down into their ah 

420.61 423.23 B: splinter countries ah 

421.93 423.76 A: mhm 

424.60 427.18 B: man i've i've never gotten them all straight 

427.73 429.71 A: yeah 

428.46 429.46 B: ah 

430.46 434.39 B: (( ah let's just say if i grew up if i went on jeopardy ah )) 

434.61 441.68 B: maybe maybe maybe former soviet nations would not be a category i would choose [laughter] 

441.77 444.69 A: yeah i don't think i'd do very well there either 

445.07 445.63 B: (( ah )) 

447.22 448.84 B: and um 

451.20 452.62 B: i'm i'm trying to 

452.97 457.95 B: you know in my in my mind trying to sort of scan the globe saying okay who's ticked off at us 

458.21 459.19 B: ah 

458.61 463.72 A: i mentioned pretty much everybody that can be ticked off that we could subjugate us 

463.88 473.69 A: but ah i don't think too many people can do anything about it at this point we've got a we've got a lot of control we should be able to perpetuate this lifestyle for a while 

474.09 474.71 B: (( ah )) 

476.00 476.86 B: (( [noise] )) 

477.80 479.80 B: happen to have on um 

480.64 482.24 B: what was it 

483.16 484.13 B: ah 

484.97 488.83 B: the radio today and someone was talking about ah 

489.64 490.56 B: the 

491.03 493.74 B: missing biological weapons from 

494.15 494.93 B: (( excuse )) 

495.65 496.34 B: (( me )) 

496.81 498.04 B: (( [cough] )) 

498.35 500.80 B: iraq and saying how it 

501.28 505.18 B: sounds like ah probably in the hands of terrorists by now 

504.74 505.65 A: (( mm )) 

507.44 508.91 B: and that's frightening 

509.28 510.50 A: i agree 

510.71 511.83 B: um 

512.09 517.92 B: i know they i know there's a lot that they have accounted for but there's some that they have not 

518.43 519.87 B: (( and ah )) 

520.75 523.27 B: the some they have not is 

523.71 529.22 B: if you added it altogether is like enough to kill the population of the world three times over 

528.61 532.12 A: yeah that's what i heard yeah three times over 

532.21 538.00 A: that shouldn't be good you know i i was i was wondering recently who gets tried for war crimes 

538.24 542.24 A: is it the losers of whatever war it is 

542.34 548.83 A: and the victors are the ones who are innocent or whatever i mean what i wonder what you consider a war crime 

547.27 549.63 B: (( that's my that's my impression )) 

550.02 560.78 A: yeah so it's like the loser of the country was like well i guess god wasn't on our side or that's what the winner says and he was like well apparently you're guilty let's try you for war crimes 

555.62 556.98 B: yeah 

561.40 566.75 A: last time i checked on the war pretty much all's fair except for what's spread by the geneva convention 

570.76 572.27 B: ah but um 

574.21 575.70 B: (( as a um )) 

576.60 577.94 B: (( i'm just trying to )) 

580.81 583.42 B: think here on it 

583.70 589.16 B: ah my problem is i seem to have sort of talked out the subject and 

589.70 597.43 A: yeah i i really don't think anybody is a big fat threat to the u._s. i think i think we've got it under control 

599.43 599.89 B: (( ah ))
