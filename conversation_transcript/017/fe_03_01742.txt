404.73 405.64 B: well 

405.69 408.81 B: (( we've we've taken political correctness )) 

408.84 410.32 B: (( to a ridiculous )) 

410.36 415.04 B: (( extreme and like you say it's certainly compromising our security )) 

415.99 417.82 B: (( right )) 

417.35 418.23 A: (( about some )) 

418.60 421.15 A: (( things and bargaining but it's still kinda scary because )) 

420.93 423.93 B: (( mhm [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

424.38 424.99 B: (( that )) 

425.04 427.25 B: (( could well be you know )) 

427.09 428.50 A: yeah 

427.82 437.39 B: the bottom line is is we toughed a lot of countries and they're not standing beside us and they've actually helped our enemies right under our noses 

432.93 433.78 A: no 

436.80 437.86 A: right 

437.44 442.87 B: and uh i think that's why all the protesting has been going on and stuff like that because 

442.09 446.39 A: well it's it's also spring and they're college students [laughter] 

446.06 447.18 B: mhm 

447.01 451.59 A: i i think a lot of college students will go out i mean you know it's something to do 

451.60 452.79 B: well yeah 

451.89 456.36 A: i i don't know how informed their their opinions are 

456.76 463.20 B: well i was a college student once and if it's anything like um what i learnt when i was at penn state 

462.79 464.24 A: mhm 

463.24 467.31 B: um you have your ultra liberal in- instructors who 

466.27 467.56 A: exactly 

467.80 482.60 B: toe the policy line and they'll even lie to the students and stuff to convince them that something is reality when it's really not um and if they're the ones that's teaching the kids about foreign policy that's a real scary thing too 

482.60 484.55 A: [laughter] absolutely 

482.78 486.04 B: [laughter] that is scary because 

486.31 492.32 B: i just remember back in my classes at college and this hasn't been like that long ago 

489.09 490.50 A: mhm 

492.34 498.95 B: and just the things that we were taught and how kids aren't taught to think critically and they don't question 

499.08 504.71 B: and um the instructors there's some especially if he's a well written and well known instructor 

504.38 505.70 A: mhm 

504.89 506.77 B: his word is [noise] like the gospel 

507.22 516.81 B: and i saw that a lot especially when we talk about foreign relations i know a lot of instructors say george bush doesn't have a good foreign relation program 

516.57 517.72 A: mhm 

517.84 522.15 A: and and you're right the educational establishment tends to be ultra liberal 

522.02 523.12 B: mhm 

523.05 524.84 A: at a lot of schools and uh 

525.74 530.50 A: and and they've put i think social engineering well ahead of 

525.75 526.88 B: yeah 

530.62 535.12 A: giving kids and it's not only on the college level it's below that 

534.60 538.61 B: mhm yeah that's why i homeschool [laughter] 

535.20 536.04 A: it's 

538.67 539.95 B: so when my kids 

540.00 542.90 B: go to sch- college they'll have a foundation 

542.58 544.11 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

542.99 552.20 B: and they'll know certain things you know and they know where we stand and then they'll figure out for themselves where they wanna stand but at least they'll be given the truth about 

547.01 548.16 A: mhm 

552.43 559.83 B: our foreign policy and why we're the way we are and why we choose to stand on a side that we stand on uh 

554.10 555.11 A: right 

559.04 566.72 A: yeah and basically you know the school that the schools should get out of their social engineering and begin teaching 

566.72 567.76 B: yeah 

567.00 570.19 A: basic hard basic subjects again 

570.10 571.11 B: right 

570.51 577.77 A: and i think we're falling well behind in in terms of you know education and and employability 

572.91 574.07 B: mhm 

577.44 579.11 B: right right 

578.20 582.48 A: you look at the large corporations now and you look at the proportion 

582.63 584.09 B: mhm 

582.65 585.90 A: of the students there or the workers there 

585.61 586.88 B: right 

586.17 589.00 A: who are from other countries 

588.91 590.09 B: mhm 

589.69 595.81 A: and they seemed to have received much better education particularly in the sciences than our students do 

594.66 599.89 B: yeah and then we l- we've let them come over here and learn a lot of stuff they're re-
