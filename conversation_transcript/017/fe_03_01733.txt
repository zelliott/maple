64.27 65.36 B: mhm

68.10 69.31 B: yeah 

79.21 81.19 B: oh you did yeah 

80.88 84.57 A: yes and i think that they traced that back down 

84.63 86.80 A: to libya 

86.90 87.87 B: uh-huh 

87.21 88.76 A: was one of them 

88.77 89.52 B: (( yes )) 

88.83 99.92 A: uh and now we're hearing again more about libya uh in terms of muammar gaddafi's visit to egypt 

99.76 101.50 B: mhm 

100.78 104.97 A: and that was about nine months ago or so 

104.76 105.67 B: yeah 

105.88 107.90 A: and um 

108.05 113.66 A: uh then now the cole has the attack on the cole had been 

114.31 120.22 A: traced to men in yemen and yet they escaped not too long ago ten of them 

116.72 117.48 B: (( yep )) 

120.04 127.50 B: yes i know that yeah but i think they've been captured uh a few of them or all of them didn't they 

127.22 131.92 A: oh really i didn't i'm not aware i'm not aware of that 

128.97 130.87 B: yeah i think they 

131.32 139.16 B: yeah they've been captured i think i think especially the main person i think he's he's been captured and 

136.02 137.07 A: uh-huh 

138.72 139.76 A: yes 

139.69 148.78 B: (( i think he's the oh as a matter of fact if i read whatever i read from the newspapers i think uh he's )) 

148.88 156.76 B: he admitted you know that he did what he did and he was helping for probably the authorities to see 

157.18 159.88 B: if they can probably uh 

160.43 171.66 B: get in you know get to the other people who were like responsible for these things but i am not sure don't quote me exactly on that but i think you know 

167.00 169.02 A: mhm 

171.60 176.73 A: well i'll look in the newspaper again and see if i can catch more about that 

176.32 181.77 B: yeah i think uh i think he's been captured yeah well yes mhm 

177.75 178.82 A: (( yeah )) 

179.97 185.60 A: well one of the things in working for the state department that i'm aware of is 

185.81 197.76 A: oh i guess for the past five years or so many of our embassies have been semi evacuated almost every year for the past five because of 

193.54 194.46 B: yeah 

198.14 200.27 A: anti american sentiment 

200.32 206.10 A: and perhaps danger to the wives or spouses and children 

205.90 207.06 B: mhm 

206.34 210.05 A: who have accompanied the officers over there 

210.23 213.71 A: and that's really an indication of how 

214.11 215.19 A: the 

215.52 216.85 A: um 

217.79 221.62 A: attacks against the u._s. have been escalating 

221.95 227.95 A: in recent years the thing that disturbs me is [cough] 

223.93 225.09 B: yeah 

226.39 227.22 B: mhm 

228.52 231.20 A: after the fall of the berlin wall 

230.89 232.25 B: mhm 

231.63 236.87 A: the intelligence agencies the american intelligence agencies were really 

236.94 246.24 A: not funded so that a lot of our intelligence is not as good currently as it should be 

238.80 239.77 B: oh 

246.65 251.97 A: and uh although many european countries are co-operating 

246.77 247.70 B: yeah 

251.83 252.80 B: mhm 

252.00 253.64 A: and notably 

254.12 258.97 A: spain because of the problem with the basques that they have in spain 

258.68 259.60 B: yeah 

259.03 264.66 A: and i should say even more notably britain because of their problems with the i._r._a. 

264.43 265.52 B: mhm 

265.15 266.36 A: um 

266.42 268.50 A: but italy also 

268.64 273.29 A: because of their terrorist groups that were kidnapping 

273.31 278.44 A: uh well known and and and very wealthy people 

278.26 279.23 B: yeah 

278.65 292.30 A: and uh yeah so i mean this has been in europe for a long time for a variety of political reasons so a lot of countries have joined with the u._s. because 

287.64 288.56 B: mhm 

292.45 300.02 A: it's like the old piracy which of course haiti would be because you were surrounded by water would be 

300.58 301.77 A: more 

301.84 305.55 A: [cough] prevalent and the idea is that the world 

305.82 309.50 A: then wouldn't allow the pirates to land any place 

309.10 310.22 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

309.56 312.60 A: and it's it's sort of like 

312.73 314.38 A: we have to 

315.59 318.15 A: get the world together to 

318.59 320.22 A: say terrorism 

320.87 322.87 A: cannot be tolerated 

320.88 321.94 B: yeah 

322.69 332.59 B: yeah i can understand though what you portray let's see if i understand you correctly so you are for the invasion right 

332.77 337.99 A: i'm not sure i'm truly not sure i don't know what i would do 

334.49 335.82 B: you're not sure 

337.71 338.83 B: mhm 

338.21 342.94 A: if i were the president of the united states i truly don't know 

342.99 344.07 A: um 

344.69 349.17 A: i i don't know the extent of the intelligence 

348.99 350.22 B: yeah 

349.53 352.59 A: in terms of imminent attacks 

352.22 353.40 B: mhm 

352.80 355.25 A: certainly we're finding out 

355.50 358.89 A: more of a relationship with the terrorists 

359.09 360.46 A: in iraq 

360.33 361.34 B: mhm 

360.61 363.23 A: than we were aware of 

363.33 364.77 B: well 

363.61 367.36 A: we haven't found the weapons of mass destruction 

367.16 368.41 B: yeah 

367.89 369.20 A: um 

369.46 377.81 A: and i don't know whether or not they moved to syria which is possible or to libya or 

377.99 384.46 A: maybe they're yet to be discovered uh i really do believe that they just wouldn't be 

385.00 386.89 A: in a place where 

385.88 387.92 B: (( mhm )) 

387.48 388.64 A: um 

388.93 390.99 A: the danger could escape 

392.21 393.62 A: by accident 

393.94 395.15 B: (( hm yeah )) 

394.10 395.88 A: i really do think 

395.98 396.92 A: (( [cough] )) 

396.99 403.92 A: that they will be difficult to find i really do believe that they are there given um 

404.46 410.19 A: the problem in france with the rycin that was found in the bus station 

410.05 411.21 B: mhm 

410.85 414.93 A: and the arrests of people who were 

415.31 416.47 A: um 

416.87 418.57 A: trying to 

418.61 419.51 B: mhm 

418.91 422.24 A: uh attack the um 

422.50 424.61 A: subways in britain 

424.55 425.80 B: yeah 

425.01 427.45 A: but it it it's 

427.47 431.75 A: a terrible problem and one of the root causes of course 

431.89 434.39 A: is the israeli palestine 

434.63 435.91 A: conflict 

436.24 437.21 B: yeah 

436.42 438.01 A: and truly 

438.34 444.72 A: until we settle that because literally in nineteen forty one the british with the americans 

444.27 445.52 B: mhm 

444.97 451.70 A: took palestine away from the palestinians and gave it to the israelis and in and 

451.73 457.50 A: until that's questioned one of the things that i will 

458.12 468.64 A: admit is like the arabists the people who are pro arab in the state department years ago warned the united states that we were becoming too pro israel 

460.20 461.30 B: mhm 

468.86 470.58 B: yeah mhm yeah 

468.89 471.30 A: and that the arab 

471.42 479.20 A: nations had to be considered in our foreign policy and we didn't do that and we are now paying the price for that 

478.73 485.97 B: yeah the problem is myself i don't know how you say you're not sure i am not sure either if 

485.85 495.36 B: i don't say that uh saddam hussein and iraq you know they were not a danger to america or to the world 

495.31 496.08 A: (( right )) 

495.39 500.96 B: but the point is like i said i think we have uh other countries 

501.24 513.17 B: that are considered to me you know in my own opinion more dangerous than they were because since we already had an eye on them and they know we were watching them 

513.22 518.25 B: so that's when i would think it would easier for them to 

518.60 524.26 B: keep an eye on him the way it is and then don't you know spread ourselves too thin 

524.64 525.67 B: because 

524.91 538.39 A: [cough] i understand i understand i understand that thinking and that's part of my thinking as well but i know that the political will here even after nine eleven 

526.29 529.03 B: yeah when you picture that hm yeah 

538.02 539.03 B: mhm 

538.44 543.57 A: and even after getting the average american to consider 

543.66 546.29 A: terrorism because many of my friends 

547.20 549.11 A: just were not 

549.87 552.60 A: were not accepting the fact 

552.84 562.49 A: that terrorism is a fact of life in the u._s. in the u._s. and they wouldn't accept that they didn't want to think about it uh nine eleven was an aberration 

557.16 558.30 B: mhm 

562.52 563.38 B: (( mm mm mm )) 

562.57 566.14 A: it was more drastic than was planned 

566.21 567.37 A: um 

567.57 569.72 A: and they just didn't want 

569.74 573.18 A: to deal with it or allow congress 

573.24 578.63 A: to spend the money to deal with it and i really do think the president then 

575.85 577.29 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

578.64 583.71 A: because we couldn't find bin laden put a face on it to get 

583.82 586.04 A: the american public 

586.42 588.27 A: to deal with the issue 

588.55 592.90 A: and to allow the government to deal with the issue of terrorism 

592.99 593.67 B: (( mm )) 

593.42 599.66 A: because many people out in iowa or north dakota whatever were not
