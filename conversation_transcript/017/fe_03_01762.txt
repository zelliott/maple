0.22 2.78 B: hi ah my name's moxi 

2.78 4.28 A: and i'm dawn 

3.88 6.20 B: hi how are you this evening 

5.76 7.30 A: not bad how are you 

6.74 10.36 B: very good thanks we have an interesting topic to talk about 

7.93 8.58 A: yeah 

9.59 12.07 A: we sure do [laughter] 

10.52 17.98 B: i i didn't hear anything when i first called in they didn't say what it was so i was just holding to find out did you know ahead of time 

17.59 21.27 A: um they yeah they the first thing they said was foreign relations 

20.58 29.63 B: oh okay yeah i just heard that so i guess we're talking about any cou- any country that would be a threat to our security right 

23.15 24.29 A: [laughter] 

27.32 28.62 A: a threat 

29.02 31.83 A: right [laughter] 

29.95 35.47 B: well there's a lot of that going around right now i guess with iraq yeah it's rather scary 

32.14 33.80 A: there sure is 

34.93 38.86 A: there sure is and i bet they're still a threat 

38.41 51.27 B: i think so i think it's gonna be a a standard procedure from now on i think that we're gonna have to change our our security system i'm glad they have made some changes now you know major changes and a a new department now 

51.00 52.51 A: right 

51.66 55.83 B: that's ah been set up i feel a lot more secure [laughter] 

55.21 65.29 A: yeah i think the airlines could probably still do a couple more things but you know they can only do so much without having to pretty much handcuff everybody that goes on board [laughter] 

63.50 69.86 B: i know i know there's plenty of room for improvement and i'm sure over the next few years we will see a big difference 

69.42 71.25 A: yeah exactly 

69.89 76.73 B: and hopefully they will be able to speed up the um airlines a little bit too and it would be ah a nice thing 

76.21 78.35 A: that definitely would be a plus 

77.11 85.27 B: a lot of people travel you know are complaining about that of course you know i can understand um you know with everything that's been going on 

84.85 90.29 A: yeah maybe even having stricter policies as to who is allowed to enter and leave 

89.86 94.71 B: right yeah i think so and i understand that some of the um 

90.44 91.40 A: [laughter] 

94.81 98.44 B: airlines are carrying though ah guns too on 

98.10 100.22 A: mhm 

98.60 107.23 B: yeah which is you know it's kind of controversial there i guess too whether it's a good thing or a bad thing but myself i think i feel a little bit more secure actually 

104.09 105.45 A: exactly 

106.67 109.28 A: i do too i travelled um 

109.56 116.38 A: september sixteenth no september fourteenth right after the twin towers went down and 

113.18 113.98 B: uh-huh 

115.31 128.14 B: i i was on um i came home on on that ninety three flight i was supposed to be on a different one and they sent me on and um it was like three days before september eleventh 

127.79 128.94 A: wow 

128.31 134.54 B: and ah it was such an odd feeling 'cause i took that pittsburgh flight i was supposed to fly from chicago to 

134.44 143.96 B: ah philadelphia and they had changed it to a pittsburgh flight and um it was the first time i was away for um some time my daughter's young yet and 

143.86 154.03 B: ah when i got home and after we heard about that my husband said no more flights for you for a long time it kind of shook him up a good bit after we you know we heard what had happened 

149.02 150.68 A: [laughter] 

153.44 163.52 A: exactly well we had flights for september fourteenth and i had actually cancelled it until my daughter convinced me that it was probably the safest time to fly and and we ended up rescheduling 

157.80 158.78 B: (( mhm )) 

160.98 162.04 B: uh-huh 

162.81 167.09 B: did you did you actually go then you just kind of postponed it for a little bit 

164.72 173.05 A: i went but i yeah i went but it wasn't easy [laughter] it just it was i mean there were about six people on the plane 

169.30 170.42 B: no 

170.56 171.72 B: but the rates 

172.23 181.71 B: yeah the rates the travel rates were really low at that time too they were out there you know advertising low rates all over the country to get people to go i know 

179.45 180.62 A: yeah 

181.48 190.60 B: you know a lot of people that were kind of bold you know they were out there travelling quite a bit and using those free rates low rates for you know a few travel trips 

190.37 193.93 A: right [laughter] right i'm not sure 

193.84 199.43 B: i mean other countries too you know we we do have you know a different kind of outlook on 

199.33 211.74 B: the countries since we had september eleventh and i think you know all all around the board they're gonna probably ah you know make sure that we're safe and and check you know security all over you know other various countries china 

211.68 217.70 B: um other countries too i guess that you know may may be of some type of threat to us 

217.53 226.71 A: right i am just hoping that nothing gets as worse as it does did september eleventh but they say we're supposed to still have sparse things here and there but 

222.47 223.61 B: yeah 

225.96 232.24 B: yeah i i guess until they get the bugs out you know we're gonna probably always have that over our head now 

232.68 239.63 A: exactly well you say you've got small a small child yeah it's them that you we have to worry about you know because 

235.19 236.36 B: yeah 

240.27 245.36 A: it can still go on even you know as they become adults it can still be going on and 

245.03 251.13 B: right ah they're gonna have a different outlook all together than what we did growing up as kids you know 

250.83 252.03 A: right 

251.18 260.50 B: ah you know not just travel wise but just i mean we live close to um it's we can actually see the ah nuclear power plant from our home here 

260.15 261.92 A: oh does that worry you 

260.43 272.48 B: in pennsylvania and actually well we we kind of keep a positive outlook on it you know we we just say if anything happened we would be among the very first and we probably wouldn't even know what was going on 

272.30 273.25 A: (( ahah )) 

272.57 282.71 B: you know if there was any any problem i mean as far as it blowing up but we ah have state police manning it twenty four hours a day you know and ah armed guards 

282.23 285.20 A: has it always been that way or just recently 

284.04 298.15 B: no just since sep- september eleventh right yeah they've been out there um you know twenty four hours a day um manning that they have ah gates up and they check every vehicle that goes in there 

286.44 288.86 A: really wow 

297.73 300.12 A: well that helps to feel more secure 

299.36 306.92 B: it does it definitely does the state police have been really you know busy here in the area what part of the country are you call- calling from 

306.46 313.35 A: actually i'm in alcart indiana but we're pretty we're like three hours from a power from a power plant but we've got 

308.17 309.56 B: oh how nice 

313.51 316.87 A: the major heart of the conrail system here so 

316.05 319.62 B: uh-huh well there's a security thing too i guess you know 

319.12 324.30 A: well actually we haven't noticed anything in security changes i mean more planes flying over but 

323.66 324.71 B: uh-huh 

324.98 328.04 A: i mean not commercial but as opposed to 

328.28 331.14 A: [noise] i'm thinking armed forces things like that but 

331.03 344.64 B: well trains are getting a little bit more busy here in pennsylvania um we see a lot more trains going through the area than you know in the last few years it it seems like they are trying to get rid of all the truck traffic here in the area so 

334.54 335.62 A: really 

344.52 349.14 B: um you know just recently there has been actually some accidents where people were 

349.01 361.59 B: ah killed ah in cars where they don't have um very good security i guess in this way because um they weren't they weren't stopping and they were going over the tracks and there was a train that hit them a few times 

354.93 355.73 A: (( ahah )) 

361.30 362.44 A: oh no 

361.67 369.65 B: there was one incident where an elderly man his car stalled on the railroad track and i guess he did get out of the car in time but um 

369.05 370.47 A: lucky 

369.75 372.53 B: just recently they started putting up some ah 

372.35 377.37 B: gates and um some some signs to to warn people because 

377.15 381.83 B: you know we haven't been used to so many trains and we can actually hear them a few times a day 

381.61 392.46 B: they are a few miles from our house but you know you you can hear the noise and i i like the train sound but you know when you think about these things you know going on as far as ah you know that type of security 

392.15 393.47 A: exactly 

392.36 398.97 B: they are making some improvements ah it's not a a cou- another country threatening or you know our security though 

398.60 401.66 A: right not now [laughter] 

399.11 400.39 B: um i can't 

401.06 412.53 B: really think i mean as far as any kind of other travelling that people would do ah can you think of any other travelling that ah would you know threaten our security that they have been up in the news talking about lately 

412.44 416.32 A: besides the the tractor trailers that they have been talking about 

415.67 417.30 B: have they uh-huh 

417.00 426.55 A: um i my husband is a truck driver as a matter of fact but he drives local and they have all been told you know lock your doors and and just be careful and 

419.01 420.71 B: is he yeah 

426.09 431.75 B: and ah what are they actually looking for then is it um people from iraq or ah 

431.37 433.65 A: mainly yeah yes 

432.11 443.54 B: uh-huh i wasn't even aware of that that's an interesting point because i i hadn't heard anything in our area here about that at all and i know some people that have that occupation too i will have to ask them then 

434.53 435.67 A: yeah 

443.30 444.49 A: it's just 

443.89 455.66 B: i know i know they had said in the news before about they were asking the truck drivers to keep an eye on things that were going around you know where they wherever they were travelling that they saw anything suspicious 

451.64 452.75 A: right 

455.89 459.07 A: right gosh i couldn't imagine 

459.52 465.56 A: what tractor trailers could do with a damage you know compared to an airplane i mean i know what planes can do now but 

465.31 466.38 B: right 

465.78 470.82 A: i mean trucks and buildings like that from the ground is will be just as bad 

470.20 474.27 B: right and i you know even here with this ah nuclear power plant 

474.18 486.07 B: ah my husband said before it's a good thing that they have so many ah gates up and everything in case anybody would come with a tractor trailer truck maybe with some type of chemicals or explosives and just try to break through the gates 

485.83 487.38 A: right 

486.09 487.60 B: and get in there 

487.66 492.64 A: gosh i don't even want to think about the damage it can do [laughter] 

489.21 490.39 B: (( [laughter] )) 

492.01 500.22 B: but as far as any other type of security in our country i am trying to think of anything else that ah beside the travel part 

499.79 501.50 A: that's what i'm doing too 

500.88 512.24 B: can you think of anything else i mean as far as i guess um you know definitely the ah germs that you know and the chemical ah threat i mean that was rather scary too when we had 

508.10 510.53 A: oh the chemical yeah 

511.19 513.28 A: definitely when 

512.45 514.40 B: that scare in the country 

513.41 516.39 A: when they were telling us to buy plastic and 

516.42 519.79 A: and um duct tape [laughter] 

518.09 530.41 B: i know i know they had made a the horrendous amount of sales on that didn't they yeah i guess the well just right now too with the boats too we have um we are in berwick pennsylvania and they have one of the biggest ah 

521.86 523.66 A: mhm 

530.54 539.40 B: ah bow plants they make gift bows and yellow ribbons are are like really really selling quite a lot now with everyone's patriotism 

536.98 538.26 A: oh i bet 

539.05 542.54 A: oh wow well that's a good thing though [laughter] 

540.90 553.08 B: yeah it is in in that part of it i guess as far as the security scare you know it's to our advantage you know as far as that part and the economy there are you know some changes like the flag sales and everything 

552.61 554.47 A: mhm 

554.14 563.30 B: um i know that you know we had that um scare in the mail a while back you know people were um exposing themselves to ah 

563.53 570.35 B: now what was it i'm trying to think of the name of it right the anthrax scare and that kind of died down ah a good bit 

565.36 566.80 A: (( the anthrax )) 

570.03 573.69 A: yeah it did it it just it left as quick as it came 

573.25 582.15 B: right and that was really scary to me it was getting close i mean um you know baltimore maryland area isn't that far from pennsylvania really 

575.55 577.19 A: (( yeah )) 

581.59 583.35 A: right right 

583.00 589.53 B: but um they never did come to any conclusion about you know who it was that was sending that either 

589.15 590.31 A: right 

589.48 598.09 B: i know last time i heard there was one man that um they were looking into i guess he had some past experience working with the government do you recall that 

598.07 599.95 A: no i don't 

598.85 599.89 B: and um they had
