4.92 8.01 A: heather yeah uh huh that's okay 

8.03 9.04 A: hi 

9.05 12.15 B: do you have an opinion on computers in education 

12.01 15.36 A: um i would have to say that they enhance education 

15.44 23.59 B: are you somebody you sound like you might be younger are you somebody who's used computers while you were going to school or if you're going to school now 

23.32 34.58 A: um i did use them for part of my college education but my children also use those i have a son that's ah in kindergarten and he's learned from a lot of ah computer programs 

28.19 29.53 B: (( uh huh )) 

34.31 41.51 B: wow do you that's amazing well you've seen ah i know what kids can do on computers today is absolutely amazing it 

41.67 42.86 A: right 

42.05 49.45 B: do you think that they rely too much on them do you think they can add on their own if they had to that kind of stuff or 

49.05 50.97 A: oh definitely mhm 

49.73 53.14 B: yeah so you don't see that it's it's a problem 

52.70 53.60 A: no 

53.24 62.93 B: no well that's great what do you think they what to you think it helps most is there anything in particular do you think it's language skills or math or 

54.95 55.90 A: (( no )) 

62.68 67.04 A: um i guess in in my experience it would probably be math for my 

67.11 70.56 A: children um as well as like problem solving 

70.12 71.11 B: mhm 

70.75 71.75 A: um 

72.08 83.11 B: do you do they use particular what do you what do they use do they use games or do they use specific education sites or how does that work i don't really know 

80.75 81.73 A: um 

82.07 92.18 A: a little bit of both we have a lot of the reader rabbit programs um that are geared towards specific ages and specific subjects reading math and so on um 

92.51 93.72 A: and 

93.81 100.69 A: he [noise] he has also you know been on line before at different sites and stuff but that's more 

99.24 100.13 B: (( uh huh )) 

100.75 104.01 A: that's probably more games that it would be um 

102.14 103.08 B: mhm 

104.07 108.61 A: educational but we also have encyclopedia britannica and um 

108.64 114.28 A: some other things loaded on to his computer that he's researched different he's very um 

114.97 122.77 A: he's very science oriented so he likes to learn about weather systems and things like that even though he's only in kindergarten he's big on 

116.96 117.91 B: great 

120.38 121.24 B: oh 

121.73 123.23 B: that's wonderful 

123.05 126.06 A: on that type of thing so [noise] 

125.26 130.80 B: and now how 'bout for you heather in your ah you're a young mom 

130.86 135.98 B: so how far as it been since you were out of school not a probably just a few years i guess 

136.51 138.00 A: it is um 

138.14 143.34 A: i actually went back to school i'm ah in the process of getting a nursing degree but um 

142.41 144.33 B: oh good for you 

143.48 147.50 A: it's kind of um on again off again kind of around 

146.32 148.38 B: hard to do with the little one 

147.93 158.70 A: it is i'm waiting 'til my second one starts kindergarten and then i'll resume that but i have um actually my last college course they sent home or a c._d. came with the um 

158.88 165.24 A: the book it was anatomy and physiology and this c._d. you could load on your computer and you could see like moving 

161.05 162.01 B: mhm 

165.39 169.78 A: moving graphics of you know the muscles and things like that to help you um 

168.99 170.66 B: oh wow 

170.06 171.76 A: get kind of a three d. 

171.36 173.29 B: oh how interesting 

171.77 177.32 A: view of different things so yeah it was it was really helpful and it gave you um like in motion 

173.70 174.78 B: oh wow 

177.52 180.93 A: um diagrams of how you know 

180.75 190.48 B: much ea- much even for me your describing it sounds it much better to visualize that way than just as you say a picture on a book you know that's 

188.77 191.45 A: right and what is what is your opinion 

190.85 204.69 B: fascinating well i haven't had my own experience in school was before computers was [laughter] the stone age it sounds like now um and in work it was pretty much 

198.44 199.45 A: right 

204.87 205.73 B: (( ah )) 

205.87 211.06 B: you know i didn't really i wouldn't say educational just using it in work so i've seen my 

210.96 214.77 B: my niece's kids who are about your kids' ages i guess 

214.51 215.47 A: yeah 

214.64 229.45 B: ah just you know how easily and how it's just another thing for them to get on on you know on the computer but i can imagine i think we're just limited by our own imagination though the smart people who are dreaming up these programs and so forth 

229.29 230.36 A: right 

229.63 238.70 B: and i guess the other thing is people are probably taking lots of courses on line and things like that you don't even have to be in a in a in a classroom anymore 

238.35 240.49 A: right that that's very true 

240.08 242.37 B: my niece is a former 

242.38 250.59 B: regular classroom teacher and now she's working with um ah a group that does ah in home schooling 

249.85 251.81 A: oh yeah yeah 

251.24 257.56 B: and um you know they're sort of all over the state it's within the state of pennsylvania 

257.17 258.23 A: right 

257.61 270.36 B: and um so they're you know they're teaching their kids and i'm sure the people who are teaching their kids are using a lot of computer type assistance that was one of the things this organization that she works for 

266.96 268.35 A: right 

270.33 276.14 B: ah was helping the some of these folks had not been on computers but in to get into this program 

276.14 286.15 B: that was part of it they they supplied these computers and then you know had to i guess there were just certain amount of things that they share on line and things like that so 

285.40 286.49 A: right 

286.27 292.14 B: it definitely is it it you know we're not going back to paper and pencil that's for sure 

291.67 299.53 A: no you know if you remember when you needed to research something a long time ago you had to go to the library and you had to look through card catalogs and 

296.81 297.62 B: right 

297.72 298.68 B: oh right 

299.40 305.29 A: you know it would take you forever to just to flip through books and try to find the information you needed now you know 

302.23 303.42 B: oh sure 

305.17 316.11 A: you just type in the word and it comes up with so many different resources to find the answers yeah and it it's very helpful especially when you have children asking questions [laughter] that you don't know the answer to 

306.50 307.47 B: mhm 

309.38 312.49 B: it's incredible it really is incredible 

314.35 315.32 B: yeah 

315.72 329.52 B: well even i i mean somebody was telling me oh so and so was at their house and he was he was i forget what the story was and he needed to get a quote from either socrates plato or aristotle and i said 

329.60 332.62 B: and it took him he was dawdling around and i said 

332.46 344.95 B: he couldn't just go on line [laughter] even i knew that you could go on line and get that stuff you know in five seconds or something like that you know ask jeeves or whatever i don't know what i don't know what kids use but 

335.42 336.80 A: right 

342.21 343.75 A: right right 

344.93 346.11 A: right 

345.00 347.65 B: so that's that's terrific 

346.37 354.39 A: yeah we had a bug um the other day well several bugs of one cer- particular kind that we didn't know what it was so we went on line and we were 

352.88 353.60 B: [laughter] 

354.36 361.39 A: i mean i didn't realize there was that many insects in the world [laughter] but you know we typed in small red insect 

357.29 358.62 B: oh my gosh 

360.64 362.47 B: you described it 

362.29 364.43 A: yeah and it came out with 

363.93 366.32 B: you had a thousand choices [laughter] 

365.66 375.64 A: it did but it helped narrow it down i mean at least we kinda had an idea of what it could be [laughter] so yeah and it was kinda fun in the process trying to learn what it was so 

367.87 369.85 B: to where you live or 

370.31 371.43 B: (( uh huh )) 

375.96 383.72 B: and of course as a student you've probably used a computer for i mean the word processing part of it is certainly you know 

382.59 383.59 A: right 

383.83 390.65 B: so so much further along than anything i used when i was typing up papers and all that kind of stuff 

388.54 396.74 A: right yeah i mean even like my old typewriter you know if you messed up you had to you had that white out ribbon or whatever you had to go back 

395.47 399.75 B: well you probably don't remember carbon paper [laughter] i 

398.76 400.60 A: i do actually 

400.34 404.19 B: remember that trying to correct eight copies of something or other 

403.17 404.93 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

404.25 408.26 B: god it does sound like prehistoric ages honest to god 

406.51 411.09 A: it does i mean i can't imagine what my kids are going to have when they're older but 

409.67 421.19 B: yeah well that's it isn't that a it's true you know you i again i think it's but our what our own brains and i i have to give credit to the people who can think of these things and say 

421.26 436.25 B: you know and i can remember seeing some of these and thinking well what would you use that for you know and i still run into people now and i ask them i'm retired now i said well you know have you gotten a computer you know well what would i use that for so you know we still have to a 

425.57 426.55 A: right 

436.20 439.04 B: lot of people still are resistant to that 

438.84 439.93 A: right 

439.29 443.54 B: which is i'm sure at your age you can't imagine it 

441.87 443.63 A: (( i think it can be intimidating )) 

443.63 448.38 A: though when you're if you're older and you didn't grow up in the computer generation like my 

446.12 446.96 B: right 

447.34 449.01 B: it is intimidating 

448.25 460.20 A: my in laws i mean they have a computer but it's literally just sitting there it's not hooked up to the internet and i have no idea what they have it for [laughter] you know because i really think a big part of it is having internet service so that you can 

459.25 460.60 B: absolutely 

460.30 464.48 A: you know research and utilize all the the resources it has to offer 

463.67 476.32 B: and i think the the seniors who get on to computers really love it i mean again there's a lot of them sometimes can't get out they're home bound so this way it keeps them in touch with everything so you know 

472.60 473.72 A: right 

474.75 482.88 A: right i think they just i think it would be helpful if they had some sort of training course for them or whatever because i think like i said it's intimidating 

479.35 480.12 B: right 

480.63 481.94 B: and i think they're 

482.50 491.66 B: heather i think they're out there but again it's getting to do it and all that stuff but they have it and they don't use it that's a shame well at least when your kids go over maybe they can isn't 

491.80 495.63 A: right yeah and i mean my son you know he's he's 

495.77 498.90 A: been on the computer since he was two probably doing um 

498.33 499.63 B: that wonderful 

498.98 506.00 A: some fisher price program so he was clicking the mouse better than i was when he was you know two and a half so um 

500.74 501.41 B: (( oh )) 

502.66 504.22 B: oh absolutely 

506.07 510.18 B: you do think that this is that's the time to learn i think by the time you're 

506.22 507.12 A: you know 

510.26 517.53 B: eighteen it's probably all over [laughter] or at least most of it i mean i do think kids pick it up so quickly you know that kind of stuff 

516.01 525.49 A: right well it's a natural thing to him now to just be on there and you know he knows you know how to maneuver around where he needs to go 

519.01 521.86 B: (( absolutely absolutely well this )) 

524.94 534.26 B: when i saw my three year old great nephew doing this i mean who can't read necessarily you know but everything was he could find what they were 

531.24 532.14 A: right 

534.22 543.06 B: prompting him to do he could follow the instructions and look at the pictures and all that and i thought it's really amazing that he 

540.37 541.66 A: right 

542.13 546.75 A: i mean it shouldn't be used it shouldn't be used to replace a parent or 

545.82 546.78 B: (( uh huh )) 

546.60 557.60 A: you know to replace reading from books and that type of thing but i definitely think it enhances and it allows them a different um method to to learn things like the math i mean the math programs are so much fun that 

549.17 549.96 B: right 

550.67 551.55 B: yeah 

554.41 555.46 B: and and 

557.61 560.61 A: you know he didn't even realize he was learning um 

560.64 565.09 A: while he was playing it wasn't you know an effort it was more of a fun thing 

561.45 562.39 B: mhm 

564.84 570.55 B: oh that's tremendous that's so it's really exciting now what now you're 

566.38 569.02 A: and that's that's the most important part of learning 

570.59 573.24 B: the older child is kindergarten 

572.83 576.02 A: uh huh and i have a daughter who's two and a half 

575.77 584.13 B: she'll probably be a whiz at it as well do they are is he in a pre is in kindergarten do they have computers in the school itself 

583.05 593.35 A: they do they actually have one in their classroom um and mostly the teachers use it like with the students the students aren't on it you know by themselves too often um 

585.37 586.23 B: (( do they )) 

588.92 589.87 B: (( uh huh )) 

593.43 599.53 A: and a lot of the students in my son's class are not familiar with with computers as my son is so 

598.78 599.89 B: oh you can see the
