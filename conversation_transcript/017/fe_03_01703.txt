17.60 24.43 A: really uh well the only person i've talked i've missed two calls but the only person i've talked to was in california also 

18.68 19.44 B: yes 

24.34 25.19 B: (( mm )) 

24.97 25.92 A: um 

26.06 28.41 A: well i suppose the middle east 

27.75 28.33 B: (( [noise] )) 

28.61 30.25 A: the unrest 

30.95 36.80 A: [noise] um it's it's never stopped [laughter] it seems to me 

37.00 37.59 B: (( [noise] )) 

38.30 45.72 B: yeah i don't think that it's not i don't know that it's ever it's going to be workable 

45.95 52.11 B: in the middle east there are so many different religions and issues and 

51.92 52.49 A: (( [noise] )) 

52.60 53.64 A: and 

52.96 53.95 B: so much 

55.13 57.59 A: i know and i mean i think maybe 

57.81 64.84 A: i think there it's possible to have a peace in the middle east but that is only i think after 

64.97 68.59 A: other countries and other religions all 

68.90 73.72 A: take some stand on trying to understand rather than take over 

73.84 75.39 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

74.21 81.65 A: you know it's like we we don't even understand the middle eastern religions or their cultures that well and 

81.98 85.64 A: and sometimes we're trying to tell them what to do you know [laughter] 

85.34 95.73 B: yeah i think that it's going to take some cooperation from more than just one end of it i think everybody's going to have compromise and give a little bit 

86.58 87.50 A: and 

96.05 97.64 A: i think so too 

98.14 99.19 A: um 

99.81 105.33 A: there's this guy who is running against sharon in israel 

104.01 104.89 B: uh-huh 

105.48 108.21 A: and i- i didn't know that much about him 

105.90 106.71 B: right 

108.26 113.20 A: but it just seemed like the issues that he wanted to get done 

114.00 124.43 A: were [sigh] wonderful you know it's like you know as far as as b- being able to um give the palestinians their own area and 

117.41 118.56 B: (( right [noise] )) 

124.73 129.44 A: and sharon was a hardliner but he won anyway so 

127.64 128.46 B: right 

129.57 131.26 A: i don't know maybe there is 

132.13 136.05 A: maybe there i think it's all unfair to each other but 

137.16 138.15 A: (( ah )) 

139.18 143.89 A: i don't know it's got to start with the children i think if they're raised to 

139.55 140.49 B: yeah 

144.26 146.66 A: uh not hold grudges or 

146.70 148.41 B: right ra- 

147.31 149.38 A: swallow some of their pride 

149.73 152.70 B: [noise] right hold some tolerance and 

153.80 155.92 A: yeah i mean like here 

155.12 155.94 B: (( [mn] )) 

155.96 156.86 A: go ahead 

157.22 163.96 B: i think also the united states i think that we can be helpful in in uh maybe 

163.99 169.92 B: helping show how to live democratically and and try to live 

170.03 172.13 B: with cultural diversities 

172.30 182.41 B: 'cause we have so many different cultures here in the united states we can maybe help them learn some cultural diversity but i don't i think that sometimes that um 

182.52 185.02 B: some of the issues we need to pull out of 

185.70 187.10 A: i do too 

186.94 188.52 B: i think we're not 

188.59 191.69 B: i think that you know i think that we're not um 

193.62 198.00 B: you know we get into ever- we get into a lot of stuff that's better left 

198.88 205.73 B: [sigh] to them 'cause then ever- or 'cause then everybody thinks the united states is like the bad guys and that we're not 

205.10 206.60 A: i know 

207.44 208.00 B: (( [mn] )) 

208.06 218.89 B: you know and we send so much money and i i have a real problem with us sending so much money to all these countries and then in our own country we have people who are homeless and starving 

217.96 220.73 A: exactly i know 

219.77 220.71 B: you know and 

220.98 222.23 B: (( you know it's like )) 

221.07 226.08 A: plus you know sometimes we help 'em and it's for our agenda not theirs 

225.83 226.83 B: right 

226.41 227.98 A: you know and 

227.38 232.41 B: right and i don't think they i don't think the people who really need the help are the ones that get the money 

232.29 233.53 A: uh i don't either 

233.58 243.08 B: i think that the poor little kids you see starving on the streets are the same ones who are still and poor and starving on the street and some big politician over there is getting 

239.77 240.99 A: yeah 

243.78 246.36 B: another raise or whoever their 

246.44 253.88 B: whatever their government is set up like a prime minister or whoever is getting the money not the people who need it 

251.73 252.98 A: yeah there should be 

253.22 255.62 A: more of an accountability 

255.70 257.02 B: right 

256.32 259.91 A: um you know and plus our own media 

260.04 261.94 A: you know d- dis- you know 

262.05 270.78 A: displays us as ah entertainment you know and uh oh we're just ri- we're all rich young and thin and 

270.48 272.28 B: oh yeah we all got 

271.07 275.37 A: you know and it doesn't help our [laughter] you know i wish they would show 

275.54 278.81 A: some of the slums of our country and 

278.44 280.18 B: absolutely because 

279.29 281.81 A: and how some of these people live 

281.86 292.26 B: right uh we've had foreign exchange students and they have thought that our country is everybody's rich and everybody just goes to disneyland whenever they want and 

290.36 293.64 A: i know i had one t- i had an exchange student too 

294.44 298.86 B: yeah and that and it creates such a problem because they come over here thinking they're going to be 

298.89 307.74 B: on the go doing something every single day they're here and then they get such a disappointment such a culture shock when they find out everybody's not living in beverley hills 

307.11 309.33 A: yeah that we're normal [laughter] 

309.32 311.12 B: yeah 

310.56 311.97 A: or um 

312.76 324.29 A: you know the plus a lot of people who come over here they c- they arrive in new york city which isn't exactly um the place that would represent the whole country you know [laughter] 

323.52 326.12 B: right absolutely not 

326.39 328.39 A: but as far as um 

328.84 336.23 A: what's going on in the middle east i i think eventually if they if we all learn to condition ourselves for tolerance 

336.72 347.58 B: right i think what's what happens though is that they train their children yeah i mean you you s- see it all the time on the news you have these little kids walking around three or four years old with with uh machine guns 

347.11 352.29 A: i know and what about the one that was they dressed up as a suicide bomber 

352.24 354.71 B: (( right and and [noise] )) 

352.74 354.24 A: you know it's it 

354.69 357.62 A: and and they're they believe that 

357.77 365.08 A: that to do that is the ultimate sacrifice and you know if they do do that the family is generously compensated 

361.26 361.98 B: right 

364.89 372.94 B: oh right but see but the child i mean that child really at that age is not old enough to make that kind of a decision for themselves 

372.80 374.65 A: i know look at all look at 

373.32 376.62 B: they they really don't understand death 

376.26 378.74 A: they just think their parents are always right 

378.74 391.44 B: right well they don't understand the concept totally of death because it it's so you know in news like you were saying in media it's all glorified to these people they see die on t._v. the next day week they're back 

392.06 395.56 B: you know they're back alive so the kids don't realise that 

394.75 396.92 A: that's right that's right 

396.85 398.63 B: you know and they're [mn] 

397.53 399.72 A: they don't get it [laughter] 

399.10 404.30 B: right and then they're sending these little kids off to these training camps to learn how to kill 

404.52 406.93 A: right it's brainwashing and 

404.98 405.85 B: (( and )) 

407.37 413.37 B: k- and see we can't you're never going to achieve peace if you don't teach peace 

413.06 415.67 A: exactly or a free thought 

415.70 417.33 B: right 

416.25 418.81 A: you know if you disagree with something then 

418.83 424.72 A: it you know it's okay to check into you know other resources or be someone else or 

423.16 424.24 B: well 

424.33 428.38 B: (( yeah but in a lot of those countries they kill 'em if they don't agree with uh )) 

426.44 427.92 A: i know 

429.19 431.43 B: the mainstream type 

431.89 444.07 B: thinking i think that y- we need to get over there and help some of these people who are in poverty get out of poverty so that they would get some self esteem so maybe more of them would stand up to their governments 

443.94 445.47 A: i know i mean 

445.66 450.12 A: how m- how many people have you seen raised here to believe that blacks are 

450.21 452.22 A: uh you know 

452.72 461.88 A: n- not as superior as whites and um and they believe that because they've been taught that and and they're going to teach their children that 

455.60 456.55 B: yeah 

462.01 464.32 A: (( it's just it's a pattern that )) 

462.16 463.56 B: right 

464.91 465.90 A: you know 

465.87 473.29 B: right and until you break that pattern of teaching them intolerance of anybody that's a little bit different 

473.15 474.38 A: right 

473.63 476.45 B: then you can't achieve peace 

476.40 478.94 A: i know and i- isn't the head of 

476.90 477.79 B: and 

479.03 486.50 A: uh the beginning of muslim the muslim religion and the jewish religion they were brothers of the same family 

486.57 488.39 B: yeah 

487.33 492.27 A: you know if they could just go back to find the commonality of it all 

492.46 495.99 B: right and the people want to live in peace and people wanna 

497.23 505.23 A: i think they just need to get to it's like you know how you you may not like someone but then when you sp- are forced to spend a lot of time with them you find you like 'em 

497.29 498.17 B: you know 

505.06 506.16 B: right 

506.04 508.86 A: (( you know [laughter] it )) 

509.12 513.63 A: you know if they could all just live wherever they wanted to the 

514.00 516.04 B: right and there'd be a lot of 

514.60 516.00 A: they're fighting over 

516.70 519.29 A: they're fighting over a piece of earth 

519.57 525.17 B: right well and a lot of them they can't live where they want they [noise] get food rations to 'em 

525.31 531.88 B: and you can't they [noise] shh and they do that they do know that they keep 'em down 

531.69 532.54 A: (( but they )) 

531.94 534.18 B: so they can't get peace 

534.15 537.85 A: your the little child sounds adorable 

537.91 538.97 B: oh shh 

539.20 541.92 B: that's my youngest she's three and a half 

541.68 544.39 A: oh i l- oh that's so neat 

544.61 549.66 B: but she you know it's like for them you know it's like with my children i have six i teach 

549.67 551.29 B: my children you know 

551.31 555.61 B: my children are all very tolerant of you know other races and 

555.80 560.41 B: that type of thing because and handicaps and disabilities and 

559.47 562.72 A: good and because you're that way y- th- th- 

562.89 564.71 A: you've done what you've done 

564.76 569.43 A: you probably have no idea the positive effects that 

569.51 571.92 A: will go on and on just because of that 

572.34 573.61 B: right 

573.57 587.37 B: well you know that's what you know i know a lot of we lived out of state for a while and just even even living out of state it's like over there the the people are where we lived we lived in pennsylvania and people are very intolerant of anybody that's not like them 

587.59 594.33 B: and i thought it must be like the middle east over there they're intolerant of anybody who is not the same religion not the same 

594.47 596.83 B: race not the same um 

596.96 597.91 B: you know
