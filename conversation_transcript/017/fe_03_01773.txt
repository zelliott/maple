9.44 10.75 B: oh hi

13.94 14.75 A: yeah 

14.24 15.19 B: (( ah )) 

16.21 18.31 B: have you done one of these calls before 

18.21 23.59 A: actually i did one earlier today i initiated the call instead of them calling me 

23.58 24.88 B: oh uh-huh 

24.72 26.26 A: so i think maybe 

26.31 32.21 A: this call wasn't so for me [laughter] but maybe you know i don't know maybe it was um 

32.32 35.94 A: i don't know if they just have the same person on two topics or not 

36.16 38.44 A: i mean the same topic but okay 

38.60 41.24 A: we can talk about it again anyway [laughter] 

41.62 42.89 B: [laughter] ah 

42.45 43.61 A: [noise] 

44.63 48.78 B: what do you think do you think other countries are really a threat to us 

49.72 51.77 A: i've just heard that um 

53.02 59.75 A: north korea has [sigh] the ah nuclear weapons and that kind of makes me think that they are ah 

60.58 62.33 A: possibly a threat 

63.10 67.11 B: especially since they're saying that they might be able to reach the 

67.20 70.87 B: ah west coast of the united states that's pretty scary 

69.66 73.90 A: oh that's right i heard that that they were saying that um 

74.53 79.30 A: france can reach us [laughter] that was another one that we had to discuss was france 

79.81 81.07 A: [laughter] 

80.42 85.91 B: right i don't yeah france i think france is just ah [lipsmack] 

83.50 84.25 A: (( [noise] )) 

88.28 92.35 B: sort of nodding towards the united states i don't really think they're a threat 

92.38 97.55 B: i think they just dislike us they look down their nose on us ah 

95.42 97.44 A: oh yeah 

97.83 100.84 A: do you see how white castles call them freedom fries 

100.20 102.54 B: [mn] yeah exactly 

100.96 105.64 A: and then i heard something else called freedom toast instead of raisin toast 

104.53 106.11 B: [laughter] 

107.33 121.27 B: well i guess like ah french wine and evian water and things aren't selling too well which is fine um although you know um i'm sure this isn't supposed to be a political conversation but 

120.63 128.98 A: [laughter] right i'm not see i'm not sure what they meant by threat were they specific about that about what they meant by threat [noise] no 

127.81 130.76 B: well i guess i guess they mean whether 

129.88 131.71 A: (( [noise] i'll call you back later )) 

130.89 133.24 B: um we really expect 

132.69 135.30 A: what countries do you think is a threat right now 

135.27 136.27 B: (( yeah )) 

135.39 137.65 A: (( that we're talking about um you )) 

137.12 149.61 B: yeah um you know i suppose the problem is that we had you know the media built up what they want and president bush with his axis of evil you know with iran and um iraq 

149.76 152.36 A: know it's pretty much where i'm getting all my information 

150.13 151.92 B: (( and )) 

152.28 159.51 B: exactly exactly and you really wonder um if you consider the people that live in those countries 

152.47 153.26 A: (( here )) 

159.67 162.23 B: ah other than a few that are 

164.43 169.48 B: that are maybe terrorists but i i would say that ninety nine per cent of the people 

169.62 174.50 B: in those countries are absolutely no threat for us they just want to live in peace 

174.58 175.78 A: oh yeah 

174.72 177.53 B: and let other people live in peace but 

177.89 191.58 B: i guess there are always going to be some radicals but you know like the anthrax though you know in the very beginning we thought oh that must be somebody from another country but it looks now like that was sent from by another american 

192.29 194.70 A: yeah like the oklahoma city bombing 

195.09 197.22 B: (( yo yeah right )) 

195.30 198.98 A: our own country is a threat to itself [laughter] 

198.48 201.98 B: right i i don't think that many countries really 

202.25 214.08 B: um you know really care what goes on here they you know they might look down their noses at us and think we're you know some awful country but i certainly don't think they're any threat to us 

214.80 217.39 B: other than a few radicals but 

217.73 218.67 B: (( um )) 

219.39 222.01 A: yeah i don't see any countries benefit in 

222.05 224.37 A: threatening us or [laughter] 

223.84 230.08 B: yeah i mean you know in a way we were cert- certainly taken by surprise on september eleventh 

230.07 231.17 A: (( yeah )) 

230.51 234.21 B: because we were used to just other countries leaving us alone 

234.43 235.31 B: (( ah )) 

234.77 235.86 A: right 

235.43 241.36 B: you know that was really the the first time i mean we haven't had any suicide bombings or 

241.65 251.46 B: ah anything like that from people from other countries you know they've attacked our embassies in other countries but nothing on the united states soil 

251.75 256.41 A: yeah not much goes on on our soil huh [laughter] not much ah 

254.36 255.81 B: (( yeah )) 

257.36 258.20 A: (( any way )) 

258.07 259.75 B: i really expected 

260.19 267.95 B: you know after the war started in iraq that you know maybe we'd have some suicide bombings or some kind of terrorist attacks but 

268.14 269.66 B: you know haven't yet 

269.68 274.58 A: i yeah i think i expected more than what there is going on [laughter] there hasn't been anything here 

274.23 284.27 B: exactly and i don't know if it's because our you know f._b._i. and c._i._a. or something are are actually catching the people before they can do anything or 

284.36 293.10 B: you know if it was just you know nobody's that interested i mean they may talk about attacking us but you know as for ah actually doing it 

293.34 294.16 B: (( um )) 

294.41 296.49 B: i don't think it's real likely 

296.22 298.62 A: yeah let's go lie low for a while [laughter] 

298.60 299.77 B: yeah 

298.81 299.97 A: maybe 

300.27 301.27 B: right 

301.39 303.97 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

302.26 303.60 B: i thought maybe 

304.29 306.59 B: i thought maybe september eleventh would 

307.18 311.50 B: you know people saw that they could attack the united states that they might 

311.79 312.42 B: (( ah )) 

312.45 316.33 B: go oh maybe we can do that too and ah 

316.53 321.38 B: i think we've been lucky that that's really the only only attack that we've had 

322.40 327.29 A: yeah really they don't have any other allies as far as um 

328.20 330.58 A: that we're aware of 

331.92 337.71 A: they they just shut themselves by making themselves an enemy out of pretty much everybody 

337.40 338.28 B: (( yeah )) 

338.54 341.61 A: um another caller i spoke with earlier today um 

341.84 347.38 A: mentioned communism as a factor in it just that they view things differently than we do 

348.48 360.12 B: oh yeah people are always going to have their own views and their you know their own beliefs and they may think we're crazy for not having the same beliefs but you know as for attacking people 

352.31 353.54 A: (( oh yeah that's )) 

360.54 361.30 B: (( ah )) 

362.19 365.82 B: i don't think there are that many people in the world that want to attack 

365.92 370.07 B: anybody else other than in palestine and israel i guess 

370.66 371.97 A: (( true yeah mm )) 

371.83 373.04 B: (( but um )) 

373.17 374.64 B: (( you know )) 

375.60 386.68 B: um like we really haven't heard much about syria other than that they think they're taking in people from iraq or iran who's supposed to be a big enemy of ours um it's 

386.86 389.74 B: not it's not like we have other countries 

389.97 395.00 B: threatening us now you know because of what we did in iraq that i've heard anyway 

393.15 394.26 A: mhm 

395.99 401.74 B: but i ah you know it's it would be nice to be able to get news 

402.03 406.99 B: from somewhere other than our you know normal news sources 

407.55 410.42 B: just to hear what other countries are really saying 

410.94 413.79 B: because we we don't really get that at all 

414.94 419.30 A: i'm wondering is this is this um considered over now because i haven't 

419.54 422.28 A: seen as much coverage on the t._v. [laughter] about it 

421.64 425.52 B: right exactly it's sort of really died down 

427.05 432.19 A: we almost had our t._v. on either cs- ah c._n._n. or 

432.59 436.82 A: fox news on constantly we had our t._v. on that [laughter] 

435.62 437.61 B: exactly yeah 

437.49 440.88 A: and now it's just you know regular tv [laughter] 

440.24 445.66 B: right yes oh so nice when they weren't having commercials there for a while 

445.10 446.40 A: oh yeah 

445.75 449.62 B: but that didn't last very long unfortunately [laughter] 

448.45 453.59 A: i heard also some of the um the stocks that we had went up so [laughter] i'm happy about that 

453.00 454.24 B: yeah [laughter] 

453.75 455.63 A: like microsoft and um 

455.73 456.90 A: oh 

457.14 465.22 A: what is it intel maybe the computer kind of dot com kind of american business kind of thing it's like [mn] 

465.65 468.55 A: cisco and g._e. 

469.22 470.84 A: definitely g._e. 

471.31 475.43 A: things like it went up enough that it made a big difference 

475.22 476.07 B: uh-huh 

477.33 480.15 A: in the 401k thing [laughter] 

479.33 480.21 B: (( yeah )) 

480.46 492.37 B: i thought i thought toyota had said it wasn't going to advertise during the course of the war but i guess they saw everybody else went back to advertising so i notice they were having ads again 

492.47 499.08 A: are they the one with the new mini van that the kids helped design [laughter] is that toyota 

499.12 500.32 B: i think so 

500.88 504.38 A: (( i just saw the commercial today i want one of those [laughter] )) 

503.63 505.51 B: [laughter] 

504.60 511.20 A: i didn't really i didn't really say okay well that's not an american car or you know anything about that 'cause i know they 

512.07 512.98 A: [sigh] 

513.07 515.72 A: some people make an issue about 

515.87 519.09 A: their their car [laughter] you know 

518.91 519.75 B: (( yeah )) 

520.10 521.85 A: i don't know i really don't 

521.74 534.36 B: yeah i don't i don't know what's going on with north korea i think that's i don't know i've i've heard a lot of people say that ah you know they're just trying to get some concessions from us by 

534.68 539.40 B: by saying they're starting their nuclear weapon program again but 

539.56 542.29 A: you mean by concessions is that a nicer thing 

542.63 545.85 A: we won't bomb you if you do this for us [laughter] 

545.11 553.20 B: well i guess we you know according to my son and he knows a lot more about it he's in college than i do 

545.93 546.85 A: yeah 

549.82 550.65 A: (( yeah )) 

553.23 556.57 B: they're such a poor country i mean 

556.62 558.39 A: oh yeah 

557.48 566.29 B: you know are they really going to send a nuclear bomb over here i mean we would obliterate them i mean they're a very small country 

565.90 567.23 A: (( uh-huh )) 

566.59 568.78 B: um i don't know what their 

568.99 571.72 B: military is like um 

571.78 573.14 A: (( christa )) 

571.85 572.98 B: but i think 

574.44 579.94 B: i think they just want us to you know send 'em food and um 

580.09 584.81 B: whatever else they need which wouldn't be such a bad idea i guess 

585.21 587.73 B: (( so long as they were out )) 

587.77 589.86 A: (( quiet [noise] )) 

587.85 589.32 B: and about and 

589.40 599.28 B: surrounded by corn fields and you know they're paying people not to grow corn well why not grow the crops and send it to people that need it
