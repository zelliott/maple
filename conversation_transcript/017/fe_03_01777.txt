46.61 49.31 A: yeah 

47.11 55.80 B: can talk about it so if i understood the question correctly it was do we see any other countries as threats to the united states' security 

55.87 57.65 A: right uh-huh 

57.70 58.64 B: (( ah )) 

58.07 63.01 A: well it's a very loaded subject huh [laughter] [laughter] 

60.37 63.51 B: (( no kidding yeah why don't you pick something controversial )) 

63.22 64.90 A: yeah really 

64.72 71.39 B: i it's one of those things where ah i i think there are a couple of countries that make me nervous 

71.60 75.97 B: ah as to whether or not they are a genuine threat i mean i 

75.83 76.94 A: right 

76.07 79.42 B: potentially almost anybody could could be a threat 

78.60 81.20 A: i know well i mean for one thing 

80.29 83.35 B: apart from canada you know something like that [laughter] 

82.46 91.20 A: yeah well i mean a lot of people hate us you know and and and they always have they always have um 

86.69 87.56 B: yeah 

91.45 100.08 A: you know ah just for the the you know the countries you know in the u._n. that chose not to support us and all that controversy 

99.90 100.88 B: oh yeah 

100.16 106.20 A: um and then you know all the the ones that could you know actually be letting 

106.23 108.25 A: um terrorists in 

108.40 112.20 A: you know and all that it's it's really hard to say 

111.97 120.86 B: yeah it is it is complex because you have i think you have um right now a a group of religious fundamentalists that are 

112.29 113.17 A: um 

120.14 121.42 A: right 

121.31 131.94 B: ah taking their religion to the extreme and have decided on the target and then like you said there are a lot of countries that just kind of hate us on principle it's kind of like people don't like walmart 

124.68 126.14 A: right 

131.95 139.08 B: you know because wal-mart's the big guys and mcdonald's has been targeted with a lawsuit because they're mcdonald's you know 

132.16 133.52 A: right 

134.57 136.31 A: (( uh-huh right )) 

137.24 138.40 A: right 

139.01 139.79 A: (( you )) 

139.23 144.16 B: ah we're kind of the the biggest kid on the block right now and that's unfortunate 

143.15 145.47 A: know we're the black sheep [laughter] 

145.03 146.85 B: yeah exactly 

145.91 156.08 A: we we really are you know and um just to think you know that whole um islam thing you know the holy the holy um the religious issues 

152.25 153.49 B: (( yeah the )) 

153.53 154.60 B: (( holy war )) 

156.04 163.34 A: because so many wars already you know have been you know based on you know like a holy war type thing and and i think 

161.32 173.03 B: exactly if you look back on i mean you know christianity and the the and i mean i'm you know that's that's my faith but at the same time you look back at something like the crusades 

166.14 167.25 A: right 

170.57 171.98 A: mhm 

172.89 174.10 A: right 

173.38 177.83 B: ah good grief they're going in conquering countries in the name of god and 

177.39 178.51 A: right 

177.99 181.52 B: yikes that's the same thing they're doing here [laughter] 

180.38 187.12 A: i know it and you know it it seems to repeat you know it might sound like a cliche but it does repeat itself in a lot of ways 

185.90 186.77 B: yeah 

187.21 191.46 A: and you know just the whole thing because of the religion thing you know they're not 

191.53 198.09 A: they're looking at it as that and you know people will fight you know for their god and believe they're doing the right thing when 

198.47 201.03 A: you know maybe it's not really right 

201.05 210.31 B: yeah when the rest of the country is crazy after september eleventh when i realized that there were people out there that were willing to die 

201.39 202.90 A: is what i think 

210.33 214.86 B: even if it didn't really change anything 

214.49 215.86 A: right 

215.07 222.46 B: that's you know 'cause my opinion is has always been well surely they know if they attack the united states they're i mean nobody 

222.47 226.34 B: can really believe they're going to be able to conquer the u._s. i wouldn't think 

226.41 227.66 A: yeah 

226.75 240.71 B: but these guys don't care so we'll go and conquer the u._s. we've done a service to our god well i have no idea how you'd defend that and then because of the fact that it's not an organized army that you can have one person in one location 

228.65 229.85 A: right 

238.38 239.43 A: right 

240.46 241.78 A: mhm 

241.65 243.68 B: that's that's something 

242.60 252.10 A: i mean yeah and just the craziness of the people you know i mean somebody could just go tomorrow and fly off the deep end and decide to do something to us 

250.80 251.78 B: exactly 

252.13 255.27 A: you know so it's it's you know very shaky and 

255.32 257.84 A: i just you know it's so uncertain 

258.14 262.02 A: you know what might happen and who might be involved 

261.79 263.09 B: absolutely 

262.52 264.32 A: because you know 

264.43 268.40 A: of course it's coming and we're not expecting we're not expecting it you know 

268.69 269.71 A: (( and ah )) 

270.02 272.52 A: god knows you know what somebody might do 

272.43 273.40 B: yeah 

272.84 276.58 A: just for the plain fact of who we are [laughter] you know 

275.43 276.24 B: and 

276.40 280.21 B: it's once somebody gets something like that in their head 

279.76 280.86 A: mhm 

280.59 287.03 B: it's just almost impossible it seems like to be aware of it and to get it stopped unless they tell somebody else 

286.73 287.97 A: yeah 

287.31 291.95 B: i think as far as countries um you know the usual suspects 

292.10 299.01 B: north korea makes me a little nervous although i think they're i think they're a little bitty dog that barks really loudly [laughter] 

298.59 303.50 A: right yeah because they have all that that up there you know that we've discovered and and 

303.10 304.05 B: yeah 

303.87 306.10 A: all those supposed 

304.95 315.42 B: but the guy the guy who leads the country seems a little i don't i don't know he he seems convinced it's it's almost like a paranoia he keeps saying the united states is trying to invade us the united states is preparing to 

314.72 316.06 A: (( mhm )) 

315.72 319.09 B: we're sitting over here going we are [laughter] 

318.57 330.22 A: oh we just want to get to the bottom of what you're up to [laughter] you know we want to know you know what's what's going on over there and how come you know these prancers like looks like activity has been going on over there 

321.27 322.80 B: (( right yeah )) 

329.94 337.65 B: we'd rather not have california nuked i think that's the main thing [laughter] no nuclear weapons launched towards california if you can if you can 

337.15 338.75 A: are you in california 

338.73 342.14 B: no actually i'm in ah in tulsa oklahoma 

341.95 344.32 A: yeah i'm in texas yeah 

343.64 345.34 B: oh okay so you're just south 

344.60 345.87 A: yeah 

345.72 357.79 B: so you know for me i mean it's it's one of those things where i don't feel the direct threat but i can imagine what it would be like living in california knowing you know if he gets one of those built [laughter] he can get to me 

355.22 356.84 A: yeah 

357.51 359.66 A: (( i guess definitely )) 

358.36 361.01 B: that would make me nervous and then 

360.58 361.42 A: mhm 

362.10 366.03 B: i kind of wonder what's going to happen with saudi arabia as well 

363.03 364.39 A: yeah 

365.41 370.53 A: yeah because they bear us you know one of those you know they've got some power themselves 

370.42 371.46 B: yeah 

370.88 378.03 A: over there and what what would be the scariest thing is for a bunch of these ah countries to to gang up 

377.91 378.90 B: yeah 

378.20 384.39 A: and and band together and and come up with a plan you know to go against us ah because you know like you said 

384.44 388.14 A: just one country probably can't do it but 

387.07 389.46 B: but a bunch of them together probably could 

388.74 394.56 A: yeah if they somehow or other banded together and decided that to retaliate 

394.69 400.53 A: against us for religion or power type whatever it might be 

400.78 402.45 A: or just plain hatred 

402.45 410.85 B: well russia and china when they began making noise about what we were doing that made me a little bit nervous because although russia is broke 

410.95 416.26 B: ah neither one of those are small countries they've got an awful lot of people they could throw at us if they wanted to 

415.70 421.75 A: right they've got god knows what they have [laughter] you know [laughter] yeah 

418.68 421.49 B: yeah exactly so has china 

421.79 428.16 B: russia like i said i figure they're so broke they don't have much at this point but china china is one that 

427.34 428.45 A: (( uh-huh )) 

428.36 431.04 B: they they could have any number of things 

430.70 432.20 A: yeah 

432.37 436.67 B: so those those two i think in the middle east ah 

436.69 437.83 A: yeah 

437.17 441.36 B: china ah not really i don't think russia's really going to do anything now 

440.68 442.66 A: yeah i don't think so either 

442.23 446.04 B: ah and then ah north korea and 

446.07 458.09 B: i have been interested um of course this has this has gotten a lot quieter it seems like since we went to war with iraq but there was a time at least where india and pakistan looked like they were going to go after each other 

456.51 457.49 A: yeah 

457.99 458.91 A: uh-huh 

458.59 467.67 B: and ah i haven't heard anything lately on that but that because of the fact that what had they had they both gotten nukes i couldn't remember whether they both go- 

466.96 470.56 A: i don't know but you know they've always i think they've always been ah 

470.77 473.51 A: in in a battle over ah cashmere 

473.29 474.73 B: yeah exactly the 

473.57 476.07 A: but you know that's been going on forever 

476.37 478.66 A: so that's like nothing new but 

476.48 478.11 B: (( same sort of thing with israel )) 

478.19 479.41 B: and palestine 

478.67 480.99 A: there are a lot of muslims over there 

480.85 481.74 B: yeah 

481.06 486.55 A: too you know and and i don't think they like you know the fact of what we did and 

486.45 487.24 B: (( no )) 

486.69 491.78 A: everything because you know they're going to all stick together if you ask me i really think they would if 

491.82 493.79 A: it came down to it 

493.10 503.73 B: it does seem like that group ah sticks together very strongly and it's something that that surprised me i must admit it did catch me off guard in iraq when 

497.35 498.89 A: yeah 

503.83 507.27 B: we started seeing some anti american protests 

507.35 509.04 B: after we liberated them 

507.42 508.55 A: right 

509.33 516.48 B: that was a little hard to watch um but kind of like you said their religion is more important 

509.72 511.00 A: mhm 

516.01 517.17 A: mhm 

516.56 519.48 B: than anything else that's going on 

519.18 520.23 A: right 

520.02 524.65 B: part of part of me admires it and part of me is completely terrified of it [laughter] 

523.69 525.04 A: yeah 

524.70 526.39 B: um 

525.07 529.56 A: because you know it's just you know that that blinds them to 

529.97 534.37 A: seems like what to do what's really right for the greater good 

532.70 533.54 B: yeah 

534.02 538.83 B: or to or to appreciate anyone outside of their religion i mean you know that's 

538.80 552.95 B: you know that's my thing i i tried to reverse the thing in my head and think okay let's let's say that i was that that the united states was a country that was overrun by russia or china or whatever let's say that there was another country 

550.30 551.64 A: mhm 

553.42 557.99 B: let's say it was a middle eastern um you know islamic fundamental 

558.34 561.36 B: muslim country that came in and liberated us 

561.28 562.43 A: yeah 

561.79 566.76 B: would i be spitting on them and telling them to get out no i don't at least i don't think so 

566.16 570.58 A: if things were really bad you know i mean i mean i i think it would be a good thing 

570.50 571.51 B: yeah 

570.84 572.47 A: you know but 

571.70 574.94 B: i wouldn't wouldn't necessarily trust them that much 

574.53 576.63 A: no no of course not 

576.36 580.78 B: i would be nervous but i wouldn't be trying to i wouldn't be protesting [laughter] 

580.37 586.16 A: right yeah because they are you know if they could just realize you know this is not about your religion 

585.92 587.15 B: right 

586.19 588.47 A: you know and it's not about your oil 

588.28 589.32 B: right 

588.55 590.52 A: you know it's really not 

590.60 596.08 A: you know but a lot of people view us as going in there and trying to take over because of that oil i think too 

595.96 596.95 B: (( yeah it )) 

596.18 597.27 A: you know 

597.15 599.89 B: has been funny to watch rumsfeld ah responding to
