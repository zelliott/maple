63.71 65.10 A: god 

65.67 66.45 B: um 

65.85 66.88 A: (( you know )) 

66.66 71.18 B: anyway we can talk about this if you want um you wanna go you wanna go first 

68.67 69.68 A: yeah 

70.64 79.72 A: you know what i was thinking now the question was did we think there was another country that might endanger the united states or whatev- wasn't that the question 

79.21 80.25 B: yes 

80.42 81.12 A: (( [cough] )) 

81.18 85.19 A: you know the first country i thought about was that syria 

85.26 86.90 B: right 

86.30 92.13 A: you know the one they supposed to be harboring these weapons and harboring the people from um 

89.40 90.27 B: sure 

92.94 95.49 A: iraq you know 

95.30 101.60 B: i actually think that i think they're a threat i don't think they're as big a threat as north korea because i think that guy is totally nuts 

101.68 105.13 A: yeah yeah then that north korea business 

102.69 104.62 B: um 

104.87 106.52 B: yeah it actually has 

106.69 113.27 B: nuclear weapons i think syria saw that we could take iraq out pretty quickly and they're certainly 

113.07 125.85 B: i don't think they have this i mean i don't know all the intelligence around it but i would from what i've watched on t._v. and read about i can't imagine they have nearly the military capabilities that iraq had or the weapons or the infrastructure 

123.67 125.32 A: yeah that's true 

125.55 129.63 A: but you know what i always say to myself i bet saddam is there 

130.06 131.24 B: he could be 

131.64 132.60 A: (( you know )) 

131.89 137.91 B: yeah i mean they definitely harbored those guys i don't know how how dangerous those guys are i think um 

138.02 141.46 A: but that's a smaller country though isn't it than iraq 

140.55 154.05 B: yeah i think saudi arabia is dangerous because they've they've got a whole network of countries that f- you know of countries they've got a whole of network of people that funnel money to terrorist organizations that are very duplicitous with with the united states 

151.29 152.87 A: mhm 

153.68 155.10 A: (( mhm )) 

153.84 156.74 B: and it's kind of the 

157.38 169.00 B: sort of uh i was going to say the cultural center of islam but that sort of sounds terrible to say that i don't know this is really about a religious war but i think it already is 

167.34 177.56 A: [mn] yeah i it's it's i think it's a people thing you know i i you know they wanna like kinda put it on the religion but i don't think it really is 

170.76 171.61 B: yeah 

177.55 178.60 B: yeah 

177.66 181.84 A: but what have you heard on the news lately about north korea 

182.04 183.97 B: um 

182.64 184.89 A: what made you pick north korea 

184.70 197.90 B: well i've just been following it for for a few months i mean obviously the story about them you know kicking out uh or opening up the their new nuclear reactor rebuilding it and the fuel rods and and uh 

196.87 197.80 A: hm 

197.97 201.00 A: you know one thing i haven't heard too much about that 

200.77 201.60 B: huh 

202.06 205.27 A: now when did you hear this when are they when did this happen 

204.80 208.87 B: this has been in the news for a while that incident happened two or three months ago 

209.15 210.54 A: oh yeah 

209.23 223.47 B: where they uh there was some there was the atomic energy energy agency had had uh had taped one of their buildings or locked it up and they they broke the seal and they've been you know building a nuclear reactor basically there 

217.35 218.70 A: mhm 

223.70 225.27 A: oh god 

223.77 224.73 B: um 

225.15 231.40 B: and and developing you know the weapons grade uh plutonium so i think they're dangerous because that guy's really 

231.42 234.29 B: truly nuts and you know 

233.82 237.54 A: the the leader who who's the leader of north korea 

236.74 238.37 B: kim chong-il 

238.19 241.46 A: mhm and he's kooky too huh 

241.12 249.05 B: yeah i mean i think in a way the bush administration would kind of is less scared of them and hasn't been as belligerent because they are more of an old school 

249.73 255.82 B: traditional communist a- a- adversary which i think you know the bush administration is more comfortable in dealing with 

256.09 265.13 B: it than more easily recognizable enemy that they can deal with and use the traditional means whereas i think iraq was a totally new kind of model and of of an enemy 

264.14 265.19 A: mhm 

265.55 266.69 A: mhm 

267.11 273.16 A: you know what i'm always worried like when i hear things about north korea i work for this really small company 

273.05 273.88 B: yeah 

273.30 277.69 A: and they make um spent nuclear fuel boxes for power companies 

277.44 278.73 B: yeah 

278.20 283.12 A: and it's like we're really struggling for business right now and they're um 

283.62 284.83 A: [cough] they're 

284.86 294.98 A: some of their customers are in south korea it's wild you know and korea in a whole and north and south korea it's not really a big place 

294.97 295.94 B: yeah 

295.84 301.32 A: you know so it's like every time i hear about korea my ears kind of perk up because i you 

301.77 302.75 B: yeah 

302.25 303.85 A: know i don't know 

302.97 313.22 B: absolutely and i think and this may sound funny and and unpatriotic but i think with this administration the united states is its own enemy as well i think they've done a horrible job of dip- of diplomacy despite 

313.32 318.41 B: um you know despite the french and the germans really uh 

316.90 319.38 A: mhm mhm i agree 

319.51 320.89 A: i agree [mn] 

319.54 323.45 B: what's the word sort of betraying us at the u._n. and then with the whole 

323.45 337.44 B: security council resolution but i think this administration is really cocky and unilateralist and uh really into you know big business and i think you know just just on the basic level of like p._r. and relations with the rest of the world it's just awful 

336.59 341.65 A: mhm mhm big business there you go 

341.51 342.44 B: yeah 

341.83 352.30 A: you know it's like the um the gap between rich and poor is getting wider pretty soon there's going to be no middle person no middle class just rich 

350.71 351.51 B: yeah 

352.51 353.13 B: yeah 

352.56 354.87 A: or poor you know 

353.72 354.39 B: yeah 

355.30 356.70 A: it's 

355.40 356.49 B: (( it's true i )) 

356.87 360.00 A: it's pretty bad it's pretty bad 

358.15 361.78 B: also think china i think china's going to be a long term threat as well 

362.03 363.21 A: you think so 

363.21 369.68 B: yeah i mean either they're going to collapse into democracy and that's going to be an issue they've got you know a billion and a half people there 

370.13 371.23 B: um 

371.64 372.58 B: and i just 

372.72 376.01 B: you know there's a real conflict there you know really 

375.98 378.29 A: wonder where this sars came from 

378.30 379.67 B: (( yeah i remember )) 

378.51 382.31 A: there's something there's something to be scared of 

380.03 381.18 B: (( that )) 

382.41 392.34 B: that was a biolab somewhere that it was like a weapon a bio weapon that got uh you know a a biological weapon that got released by accident or maybe not by accident 

392.23 393.62 A: you think so 

392.47 393.56 B: i heard some 

393.69 396.86 A: and i wonder who was responsible for that 

393.92 396.13 B: i think it's entirely possible 

397.06 404.19 A: now it's supposedly this sars started in asia somewhere well there's a million places in asia where where you know 

397.49 398.80 B: yeah 

400.56 401.36 B: right 

403.02 417.69 B: well i think they said it started in southern china i mean it could have been a chinese you know and and it's interesting because the chinese government really was initially very reluctant to talk about to be honest about what was going on and to talk about the number of deaths i mean they're always like that so that doesn't necessarily mean 

405.70 406.90 A: okay 

413.83 415.09 A: (( mhm hm )) 

418.35 425.20 B: that's not necessarily evidence that that this was a bio weapon but you know i mean i guess it's you know it depends on 

425.89 429.05 B: we really don't know it's viable but we really don't know 

429.81 433.12 B: but i put china on the list of dangerous countries with uh 

429.83 430.87 A: (( you know )) 

432.90 440.37 A: yeah well so far we've got china and north korea and syria you know it's like 

433.49 436.14 B: with saudi arabia and north korea 

438.96 443.66 B: and syria and i would put saudi arabia on that list as well i don't know if you 

441.60 444.53 A: i hear you saudi arabia also 

444.75 448.75 A: do you know what the whole world is crazy now it's spooky 

447.50 448.37 B: yeah 

448.83 449.83 B: yeah 

449.15 450.05 A: (( you know )) 

450.06 451.29 B: absolutely 

450.93 453.14 A: it's downright spooky 

453.38 454.58 A: i don't know 

453.64 454.72 B: absolutely 

454.78 457.32 A: i don't know it it's awful 

457.26 458.59 B: yeah 

458.31 469.10 A: and then there's saddam but you know what i knew when they started this war that they would never find him i knew it i could fee- you know just like they didn't catch bin laden you know 

467.94 470.36 B: he may be dead he may be dead 

470.02 471.34 A: you think so 

471.11 474.56 B: ah he could be under a seventy foot bunker or something 

471.49 473.09 A: for some reason 

473.23 476.46 A: my spider senses are saying no to that 

476.52 477.62 B: right 

476.64 488.19 A: you know and then they want us to get out of that country already you know what if the united states picked up and left iraq today saddam would be back tomorrow i just feel like it would happen that way 

488.20 489.87 B: right 

489.65 490.85 A: i don't know 

491.80 495.82 B: hey sorry to break the subject but you said your first call was a few months ago 

491.97 493.18 A: it's spooky 

495.55 497.49 A: mhm yes it was 

496.90 500.86 B: and there was nothing kooky in your phone bill right you didn't have some weird thing on your phone bill 

499.38 502.79 A: not a blessed thing no phone bill was fine 

501.23 502.14 B: okay 

502.77 506.28 B: and you said you never got a your ten dollar check for the for the call 

505.29 506.24 A: no 

506.45 515.53 A: no i thought now i got an email at work that said you have to have two phone calls before you get money 

506.67 507.64 B: gotcha 

515.59 516.80 A: (( that's what it said )) 

515.59 517.90 B: oh okay that makes sense 

516.91 521.20 A: so maybe that's the reason is this your first phone call 

519.09 520.01 B: cool 

520.56 527.21 B: this is my second phone call my first one was yesterday but i'm glad to hear that your first call was a few months ago so that means it's probably this probably legitimate 

527.94 533.07 B: you know if they were going to rip you off or charge you some phone thing or something it would have happened already 

528.12 529.36 A: hopefully 

531.59 532.74 A: yeah 

532.72 541.44 A: so they sent me an email and you know what they asked me in the email did i still want to participate and they said in the email that they knew 

539.14 539.93 B: right 

541.22 550.01 A: people hadn't got paid because you had to get two phone calls i wish i still had the email i'd forward it to you i delete every blessed thing
