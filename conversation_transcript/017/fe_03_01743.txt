3.49 4.70 A: oh hi 

4.72 7.31 B: [laughter] i know all of a sudden we're here 

5.40 6.15 A: [laughter] 

6.81 15.42 A: i know i was just gonna hang up because i thought well then i thought no i'll hang on here for ten minutes [laughter] and see what happens hi my name is anne 

11.28 12.40 B: [laughter] 

15.35 16.16 B: (( hi )) 

15.82 16.94 A: (( hi )) 

17.12 18.39 A: yes um 

18.61 20.85 A: i i almost forget the topic now 

20.61 25.31 B: um it's w- c- what countries do we consider a threat to the u._s._c._c. 

25.32 26.68 B: and why 

26.64 28.15 A: okay okay 

26.99 27.60 B: (( [laughter] )) 

29.27 31.72 B: and what is the u._s._c._c. [laughter] 

30.99 32.65 A: [laughter] 

32.49 42.65 B: i know that the united states i do consider other countries a threat to the united states um one korea but um that's for obvious reasons 

42.11 43.81 A: yes yes yes 

43.37 58.01 B: but then again i don't know because actually my husband and i were talking about this and if korea were to do anything they'd know that we'd blow them out of the water so [laughter] they'd be committing suicide attempting anything on us anyway so 

57.79 63.71 A: as long as they didn't do something so horrible before you had a chance to blow then out of the water though [laughter] 

63.00 76.42 B: right but when i was talking to him my husband said that i don't think that they could um their weapons aren't as good as ours number one and number two they're too far away and if they ever got close enough to do any major damage we'd get them before they could 

76.12 77.02 A: yeah 

76.43 78.15 B: so from they're 

78.13 85.93 B: what they're they're talking about is trying to do something from where they are right now and the only place they could hit is california and 

85.72 95.81 B: that's it and once they've done that boom we'd get them um so they'd be committing suicide on their own country [mn] trying to even get just one state of ours so 

92.72 93.58 A: yeah 

95.25 104.84 A: yeah yeah and and i mean they're the states is aware of of uh their weapons and stuff right now so they're not they're watching them very closely i'm sure 

101.86 102.61 B: right 

104.42 105.99 B: [laughter] 

105.17 109.20 A: so uh i i should tell you i'm from canada i'm not even from the states so 

108.58 112.79 B: oh really oh i'm from the i'm not that far away from you i'm from new hampshire 

112.37 117.11 A: oh yeah no i'm on the other side just north of california [laughter] b._c. 

115.68 118.65 B: oh oh okay so you're on the other side of canada okay 

117.93 119.68 A: yeah yeah 

118.93 121.58 B: i think i'm more near montreal [laughter] 

120.88 124.58 A: uh yeah yeah no i'm on the west coast so 

124.46 125.54 B: (( oh okay )) 

125.21 131.19 A: but i sometimes i sometimes like just with all this without with canada not supporting the states in this um 

131.58 135.44 B: only some i know that some of you guys do [laughter] 

134.65 143.75 A: well well and i know a lot of you americans don't support bush either so you know it's i mean you're up here [laughter] so we we see your 

141.33 142.12 B: (( oh )) 

142.22 144.50 B: i do i love my president 

143.84 144.86 A: up here 

145.06 148.58 B: oh really no i love my president bush so [mn] 

147.65 152.97 A: yeah no i mean everybody's i mean if we were all the same it'd be a pretty boring world right 

152.23 158.07 B: right exactly yes if people have their own opinions so that's why there's freedom of speech here in the u._s. 

153.49 154.75 A: yeah so 

157.11 161.64 A: yeah and thank god we can have our own opinions without being punished for them right 

160.91 162.46 B: right [laughter] 

161.99 165.59 A: but um but no i've heard some horror stories about uh 

165.65 170.00 A: about uh canadians trying to get across the border and americans are 

169.61 171.08 B: (( oh right )) 

170.15 182.13 A: i mean it's it's not uh it's not us individual canadians it's it's our our leader [laughter] [laughter] just like your guys you know you have a leader that makes decisions for you 

174.91 175.81 B: right 

176.76 178.55 B: right oh [laughter] 

181.81 182.92 B: right 

182.48 184.31 A: as a country so um 

184.28 194.66 B: so i'm wondering if they want to know um in general if there's a threat to just the united states because they said u._s._c._c. so i'm wondering if that could be the u._s. and surrounding countries 

194.56 200.39 B: um 'cause canada is kinda vulnerable too um because you guys are so nice to everybody [laughter] 

199.65 202.40 A: well and also we're so close 

201.76 208.14 B: right exactly and you are so close and we are neighbors and allies most of the time [laughter] 

205.68 206.53 A: yeah 

207.41 211.57 A: yeah well most of the time i mean we are it's just you know if if uh 

208.58 210.14 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

211.69 220.62 A: if if nato would've of approved of this well then i'm sure there wouldn't have been a question it was just just whatever the choice that our prime minister made 

220.29 228.99 B: so i wonder if there's any other countries though that we could consider as being a threat um i know that they were was it syria they were talking about right 

228.07 234.01 A: i was just gonna say that because they've sort of uh they were hiding some stuff for iraq weren't they 

233.83 241.18 B: yeah and people were sneaking into iraq uh fighting for you know i- fighting against us for iraq and 

239.27 240.26 A: mhm 

240.85 241.77 A: mhm 

240.95 249.04 B: you know they were all sneaking in at that command i guess there was a videotape and as soon as that videotape of that it was a videotape of saddam hussein 

248.96 262.95 B: and as soon as it went on air and he said certain things that were kinda like key words people think um 'cause he said and now is the time to go and he would kinda say it as hint hint you know and any other countries that heard that as soon as that tape went on 

262.71 272.01 B: all of a sudden people started coming into iraq and fighting against us other countries so they think that videotape was kind of a here's your key here's your cue go fight 

271.19 273.17 A: [mn] uh-huh could yeah 

272.07 281.91 B: so um there are other countries and france you know of course i don't think we're afraid of france over here in the u._s. but they do seem to be posing you know 

281.81 293.05 B: arguments against us they're they seem to [mn] there seems to be a lot against us over in france um i don't think of them as a threat but i do think that right now they're not being very friendly [laughter] 

292.70 299.94 A: yeah or or maybe they're just trying to to uh not be a follower you know like 'cause it's it's uh [mn] 

297.23 298.25 B: right 

300.18 303.39 A: like not being an american is um 

303.61 308.85 A: like with you guys america's sort of being the super power of the world right now 

308.07 309.28 B: [laughter] 

309.07 314.16 A: you know it's it's um it takes a lot of guts to say no [laughter] 

311.28 315.64 B: that's funny to hear [laughter] i've never heard that before actually [laughter] 

315.16 322.09 A: well it used to be russia and china and the states right now that russia's not there or it's it's dissolved and 

317.66 318.81 B: that's true 

321.47 324.82 B: yeah now they're ju- they're states actually themselves 

324.52 331.61 A: yeah yeah so i mean it's not the power that it it was a one time and then and china's for whatever reason quiet 

331.37 338.10 B: [laughter] uh-oh [laughter] that could be a problem you know the quiet ones are the ones to be afraid of [laughter] 

332.39 335.87 A: (( [laughter] )) 

337.29 343.59 A: yeah yeah but i think it's like the leaders make a big a big um you know like some of them are a bit 

343.76 349.88 A: i don't know like like um a bit off the wall sometimes you know and it's a personality 

347.23 348.42 B: yeah 

350.35 361.20 A: like you almost think it's a personality thing like you d- like with france i'm i'm not saying that they're against you by any means i doubt if they are i doubt if they are they're just wanting to be their own country for a bit you know 

357.28 358.15 B: right 

361.00 365.14 B: yeah maybe that's true um 'cause i know that when they were 

365.04 372.67 B: they were talking about you know we don't want to do this we don't want to do that and then all of a sudden they're against us because we've chosen something different 

372.47 383.04 B: and a lot of times people get threatened if you don't like something that they they like you know same thing with just individual people if say i were to like something and my sister were to say 

379.72 380.66 A: yeah 

382.86 389.30 B: i don't like that and all of a sudden she's mad at me she's not really mad at me she's mad at the fact that i'm not going along with her opinion 

385.93 386.72 A: yeah 

388.68 391.50 A: yeah yeah and it's a sort of a standoff 

390.23 395.39 B: i think france wants to be a big power house and they can't be if everyone's going against their opinion 

395.02 403.32 A: yeah no true but like germany was the same too right a little bit there at the start they were they were making a bit of a noise 

395.87 397.41 B: (( [laughter] )) 

400.94 415.59 B: yeah because germany did have the power at one time but then again when they were when they had their little power thing it was kind of a bad behavior you know when hitler kind of made a real bad thing outta you know there was a lot of power there but it was kinda more of a saddam hussein power 

408.51 409.56 A: yeah 

415.33 416.32 A: yeah 

415.59 424.31 B: and i don't remember who took them down i know it's bad horrible me i'm a nursing student not a history major [laughter] but i know that you know 

420.94 422.21 A: [laughter] 

424.12 434.40 B: it's good when people uh you know are the bad guys are taken down maybe the country will be a little you know not in full power for a little bit but they'll they'll rise to the occasion 

431.86 432.90 A: mhm 

434.49 443.59 B: [laughter] you know and i believe fully in the bible and so i believe that iraq will rise up you know it's biblical actually that iraq you know bible babylon is right there in iraq 

434.89 435.84 A: yeah 

443.34 444.26 A: i know 

443.40 458.17 B: and you know babylon in the bible is gonna be built up into this huge great city some day and i it's right there in iraq and in fact we've been our president ordered that nobody touch iraq when we do any of the bomb- babylon 

458.34 460.18 B: nobody's to touch babylon 

460.05 460.80 A: hm 

460.34 470.61 B: so um and that's why nobody's gone anywhere near it no one's done no bombs have um touched babylon and that was an order that nobody go near that you know that city so 

470.10 471.90 A: (( oh i didn't know that )) 

471.44 483.47 B: yeah yeah and it's you know because our president is also a christian so you know he he's very careful about things like that and you know and kuwait city i'm so glad we freed them [laughter] so 

478.06 479.36 A: yeah 

482.57 493.01 A: yeah yeah yeah like but it's it's such a shame to that i mean it's off topic but all the the history that got looted and stuff in in baghdad like it's 

487.98 488.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

492.61 494.10 B: oh in iraq 

493.71 495.17 A: yeah yeah 

494.31 495.23 B: yeah 

495.00 501.38 B: i think it's a reaction you know the people are reacting to i mean all of a sudden they have all this freedom 

501.15 514.45 B: and they didn't know what to do with themselves and actually i think a lot of them were so angry with saddam hussein i mean if i were like tortured and raped and everything else and my children were in prison for years for absolutely nothing 

514.25 519.53 B: you know they didn't do anything wrong they were just in prison because they refused to be a part of his little training camps 

518.32 520.01 A: yeah yeah 

519.38 532.98 B: you know all of a sudden he's gone they're probably reacting they're reacting to the whole situation and they probably just ran in and looted and they're just having a grand old time saying huh look i'm sitting in saddam hussein's chair [laughter] something they never thought they'd ever do 

525.95 527.20 A: yeah and i 

532.53 540.26 A: yeah no i'm sure that was part of it a big part of it but but it just it just seems such a shame that that all this history is 

540.28 544.28 A: smashed or destroyed or stolen or whatever 

542.82 556.12 B: yeah they i i think they're getting it under control now it is a shame that that happened but did you hear that they also found i think it was six hundred and fifty million dollars u._s. dollars in uh one of sa- i think it's one of saddam hussein's palaces something 

555.97 562.09 B: that had to do with saddam hussein they found it in the walls i think did you hear that i think it was today or yesterday 

558.97 571.63 A: uh i heard you know i heard something i heard just i've i've c._n._n. on once in a while and i hear about it right but i did hear something but i didn't remember i just knew it was a huge amount of money they found but i didn't 

565.31 566.46 B: oh yeah 

570.63 579.92 B: oh yeah and i think they're go they're gonna find out if it's real 'cause if it's fake they're not going to divvy it out but if they find out it's real they're gonna pass it out to the iraqi people it's gonna go to them 

578.52 579.44 A: (( oh )) 

579.88 584.27 A: well they're probably gonna need a bunch of money just to to rebuild the cities 

580.08 580.96 B: so 

583.82 593.17 B: oh yeah that and you know these people they were living in you know i think whatever they're getting five or ten dollars a week for all the work that they did 

591.69 599.89 A: well i don't if you saw a while like before the war started that a guy an announcer was on t._v. and he had a wad of
