117.32 118.52 A: yeah 

124.01 131.35 B: another particular problem with a country could be [noise] china itself because 

131.60 133.97 B: china has refused to [lipsmack] 

134.45 140.69 B: uh fully cooperate with world health organizations regarding sars you know this disease uh

144.84 152.49 B: you know if enough people get that disease over in china you know they have eight hundred million people over there and [sigh] [lipsmack] 

153.11 163.16 B: we're going to need their help in uh you know controlling that disease and if china's not willing to cooperate we're gonna have major major problems

165.92 177.22 B: uh sars is a disease that uh started over in china and um people come down with s- uh symptoms similar to pneumonia

204.62 205.94 A: (( wow mm )) 

206.30 208.59 B: and what happens is um [lipsmack] 

209.51 212.24 B: because china failed to 

212.15 225.85 B: notify the world health organization uh it got a foothold in the uh country over there and of course chinese are visiting chinese and they come back to america and san francisco and new york and um 

223.09 224.47 A: right 

225.67 226.90 A: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

226.38 229.80 B: even here in philadelphia the um 

230.23 234.27 B: chinese chinatown and the chinese restaurants are uh 

234.88 240.11 B: losing a lot of money because people are not going to them they're afraid of getting the disease 

240.61 245.79 B: and it's communicable only through uh direct contact and um 

246.65 252.54 B: you know when you have a country as as big as china but a- also as backward as china it presents 

252.75 254.65 A: (( [noise] a threat [noise] )) 

252.84 259.61 B: uh problems uh almost as bad as nuclear weapons i mean uh they could 

259.43 268.13 B: through not not controlling this illness it could create significant problems and um although those problems aren't the same as the problems that north korea 

268.51 271.68 B: ha- you know confronting us with um 

272.37 276.29 B: [lipsmack] they are major and significant problems and uh 

276.15 276.87 A: (( [mn] [noise] ))

290.18 301.38 B: uh syria and and ir- iraq you know we still have to worry about uh pakistan wherever we th- afghanistan wherever we think uh bin laden might be hiding 

300.81 302.31 A: yeah 

302.59 308.55 B: and you know he doesn't have an army but he's got a following of devout people that um 

308.01 309.43 A: mhm 

309.14 312.82 B: only goal in life is destroy our way of life 

312.77 314.39 A: mhm 

313.60 317.48 B: and uh you know being unorganized and not an army 

317.54 319.81 B: it's very difficult to track them down 

319.54 324.05 A: (( mhm right whatever happened to that it's like [lipsmack] i don't know )) 

324.45 328.88 A: [lipsmack] the objectives have just shifted all of a sudden you know what i'm saying first we were so 

328.98 332.43 B: they shifted right over to s- right over to iran didn't they 

329.46 330.33 A: persis- 

331.87 333.23 A: right 

333.78 343.22 A: we were so passionate about finding this bin laden person and [lipsmack] and putting in the ads his organization and then all of a sudden [lipsmack] 

333.85 334.65 B: what 

343.72 352.57 A: we're back on iraq and it's like an awareness so that bush is trying to c- to finish resolve his father w- you know since and because [lipsmack] 

353.23 361.51 A: it's to my understanding like the relations between iraq and the u._s. have always you know been been somewhat shaky and 

361.78 365.89 A: we just gotta prove why approve of their 

366.31 370.81 A: their government and [laughter] who are we to try implement i don't know 

371.13 375.99 A: new policies and and try and and i don't know liberate

390.35 391.61 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

392.49 393.14 A: (( hm )) 

393.84 395.56 B: you know and um 

395.98 407.54 B: to just arbitrarily go in there and say well we think they have weapons of mass destruction we're going to go in and attack them it's uh it creates a chilling effect on every other country in the world and uh 

406.64 414.69 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] 'cause they're like okay when are when are we next i mean that's a question that can ask you know [lipsmack] they posted up data about um [lipsmack]

424.15 426.38 A: i forgot who was like the leading 

426.79 431.65 A: country but iraq surely wasn't it it you know in

435.90 437.91 B: for weapons they just um

460.56 462.16 A: (( yeah [lipsmack] yeah )) 

461.75 464.06 B: they're in trouble if they find them but 

464.07 469.35 B: hussein had everything and he's a multi billionaire and all he had to do was 

469.82 474.78 B: [noise] let i i guess just let some more people in there look around for weapons we haven't found any yet 

475.57 480.32 B: a- and um i guess it doesn't matter if we find any does it because we won 

481.27 482.86 B: you know for uh

493.41 496.36 B: i think you're right i think it got personal 

496.54 500.50 B: and you know when you're watching the television and 

501.11 503.07 B: [lipsmack] you're seeing that uh 

503.75 514.16 B: you know we were trying to use smart bombs and not destroy the city only destroy the uh military installations well if i was over there fighting 

514.23 517.55 B: for america a- and i saw on television 

517.52 524.09 B: that baghdad was still lit up at night with electricity i'd be very upset i'd say look you know i'm over here risking my life 

524.05 534.76 B: why don't you guys go all out i wanna see that city leveled i don't want i don't wanna hear somebody saying we're humanitarians even in war we're we're not knocking out the electric and we're

570.17 576.99 A: i agree and yeah the middle east [laughter] in general [laughter] um and then i i think

584.56 586.32 A: you know um 

586.34 593.35 A: the other countries that that may have p- posed like past threats because you know they could be planning you know what i'm saying it's just like
