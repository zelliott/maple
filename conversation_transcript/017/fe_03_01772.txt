14.66 15.63 A: yeah 

16.97 17.74 A: oh 

19.51 20.95 A: yes [laughter] 

22.40 26.36 A: oh how did how do you find out about the study being so far away 

25.73 32.01 B: ah i'm a linguistics major here at the uiu- and so they just kinda linked up and so i was kinda like i got it 

27.47 28.23 A: oh 

28.80 29.71 A: yeah 

30.42 32.82 A: yep that's how i found out too 

32.88 34.70 B: oh are you a linguistics major 

34.03 35.20 A: (( yeah um )) 

34.80 35.79 B: nice 

36.19 39.68 B: whoa um what i guess do you 

39.86 46.15 B: what what is there a country that you feel that ah is currently threatens the united states' ah safety 

45.95 49.22 A: i was thinking about that it's hard i think 

49.34 50.77 A: um i mean 

50.47 55.86 B: [noise] sorry yeah i'm sorry i'm in the car i just 

51.71 54.10 A: ooh a strange noise are you still there 

55.36 56.29 A: okay 

56.40 57.21 A: um 

56.64 58.20 B: bell went off real quick 

58.60 65.16 A: like i i've been thinking lately that that the u._s. is sort of a threat to its own security um 

65.69 67.32 A: partly like 

67.91 68.89 A: in 

69.29 72.27 A: partly in how it's acting with other countries like 

72.39 73.28 A: um 

73.84 78.79 A: i mean it went to the u._n. but it there were a whole lot of countries not in favor of 

78.81 83.76 A: of the actions taken in iraq and also partly in terms of like 

81.13 82.13 B: that's true 

84.01 87.82 A: by saying well we are going to use preemptive force we are like 

88.25 90.33 A: like that that's just 

90.67 91.57 A: um 

91.82 95.96 A: could op- you know could set precedents but then if other countries follow 

95.99 96.88 A: um 

97.70 99.81 A: could be not so great 

99.97 109.07 A: and also in spending lots of money um not on things like health care and food um is hurting the people here 

109.68 110.54 A: um 

110.55 112.89 A: so i guess like while 

114.28 122.34 A: i don't i don't know what what outside forces are threats or aren't threats like i do think the u._s. is one 

122.86 124.98 B: is a threat to its own national security 

124.53 127.32 A: yeah or is acting as one 

125.35 126.13 B: okay 

127.28 139.95 B: okay and i i and i've heard the point before it's like if if everyone has a preemptive attitude then everyone preempts each other and so all it does is lead to more conflict and i i have heard that um 

140.09 154.22 B: the only thing is like i don't know that as far as i guess sticking to the topic before i i i would like to just stress kind of what you said just a minute ah ago but north korea actually has technically they think they they have a 

148.12 148.91 A: mhm 

150.81 151.72 A: yeah 

154.52 161.27 B: a weapon a a missile that can make it over here but as far as i know they've never 

156.59 157.47 A: yeah 

161.46 167.08 B: you know they've never actually tested it they've just said they have it and so who knows if they do or not 

165.35 169.60 A: yeah they were certainly saying worrisome things um 

169.11 170.74 B: yeah that's 

170.41 171.86 A: back when they were still 

170.54 183.84 B: that's and actually i i'm a chinese linguist that's kinda kinda what i do for for my career and so we do lot with the koreans and you know we're just not the united states ah we're generally like a bull in a china shop 

173.98 175.08 A: oh wow 

175.74 176.55 A: uh-huh 

183.62 193.29 B: we're not very good like with the political maneuverings and stuff like that and the oriental community is all about face and how to maneuver and all about diplomacy and we haven't learned that much but 

190.85 191.64 A: ooh 

193.20 196.84 B: like china and like north korea they'll say all these scary things but 

196.85 208.35 B: i really don't think they're that you know they're not you know they know if they were to do something like send a nuclear weapon our way that there would be absolute and complete retribution for that like there's no doubt that they would be 

208.43 222.59 B: you know wiped out and that's kinda you know the the way it has to be there has to be that understanding [noise] otherwise ah you know someone someone will do that to us but ah as far as the country i'm not sure any country really creates a 

222.67 225.97 B: a you know a good threat for us i guess the 

226.07 234.57 B: one thing that i would say about you know if the united nations and things like that is you know for twelve years they passed resolutions and they never 

229.32 230.15 A: mhm 

234.37 242.45 B: enforced anything and i mean they never enforced anything and so it's the same thing and this is what what really makes me upset is like you got exactly the north 

236.05 236.96 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

242.62 244.53 B: the north korea situation 

244.35 250.61 B: north korea says hey we don't want to deal with the united nations we only want to deal with the united states and so united nations goes okay well that's fine 

250.42 261.07 B: so like united nations would keep quiet on let's say the situation deteriorated and we started sending troops into south korea and stuff like that then all of a sudden the u._n. would say hey wait a second you haven't got our permission 

256.79 257.89 A: mhm 

260.86 269.04 B: but it's like they're not doing anything to take care of the crisis in north korea they didn't do anything for twelve years with iraq 

268.76 269.55 A: yeah 

268.85 283.37 B: the only reason they got inspectors in and inspectors were able to do anything is because we had a you know a quarter million of our troops sitting across the border had we not had those you know those u._s. soldiers there saddam never would have allowed those inspectors back in and so you know if 

283.24 286.63 B: you just you know if if we let france 

286.40 288.10 B: germany and russian 

288.10 302.55 B: you know if we let them have too much of a say in our national security that is a really bad idea and that's why i think so in some ways i can see how the preemptive policy can be prob- problematic but i think that's a little better than letting france and germany decide 

302.63 304.74 B: what's in our best interests 

304.64 311.19 A: it's really i mean iraq really is problematic to talk about and and difficult we had ah at school um 

304.76 307.04 B: that's the only thing 

311.11 325.11 A: there's a few iraqi artists who are in exile visiting this week and one of them brought up the question of why in the anti war movement didn't wasn't there more dis- here wasn't there more discussion of civil rights ah human rights and the the violations done by saddam 

314.48 315.48 B: sure 

325.73 328.66 A: and and that is terrible but um 

329.15 330.18 A: (( people )) 

330.43 331.80 A: arguing for 

331.91 335.05 A: human rights might be helping him in some 

335.21 338.84 A: un- indirect way or not helping but but 

338.97 340.60 A: i don't know on 

340.92 348.51 A: i don't know that's it is terribly complicated when there's two things you don't want happening and they're in opposition to each other and you don't know how to oppose both 

344.77 345.58 B: (( [noise] )) 

348.15 349.99 B: (( yes setting the traps [noise] )) 

348.59 349.38 A: um 

349.75 354.15 A: but but the other thing about preemptive is that um 

354.39 356.81 A: i just think that a lot of 

357.61 365.30 A: from what i hear and read like a lot of u._s. actions in the past contributed to the problems there are now like saddam being in power 

364.98 367.73 B: (( [noise] )) 

365.27 374.39 A: osama bin laden getting power and and money the weapons that iraq did get um in the past the to help funding 

372.76 386.50 B: the the chemical warfare the chemical warfare that saddam obtained came from france and ah then it came from another corporation in virginia that's where the majority of the the ah starts yeah and that's true we chose a bad partner 

374.60 375.46 A: yeah 

382.04 382.92 A: yeah 

384.26 385.54 A: and i just think 

386.04 387.95 A: i just fear um 

386.52 388.70 B: [noise] 

388.25 391.78 A: the decisions being made today that seem like 

391.81 397.82 A: maybe that seem that seem like good decisions and decisions for security ending up 

398.18 399.58 A: you know like that 

400.11 401.09 A: and that 

403.91 407.40 B: [noise] um yeah and i i can see that the 

408.31 413.84 B: other thing is like we you had to pick your your partners and your friends in the battles as they come 

413.71 426.67 B: for example the reason like we got involved with iran and [noise] and like saddam [noise] and some of those other arabic with the had to do with the iran contra affair and things like that and so i mean 

418.86 419.64 A: mhm 

423.75 424.63 A: yeah 

426.46 440.63 B: at the time reagan was ah doing his best to fight off communism and so we'd train those people as best we could because they were the most sympathetic people that we had and ah you know maybe it wasn't a a great choice but at the time it was 

440.53 446.45 B: you know i mean communism was spreading into vietnam it had it had got into north korea and so 

446.51 453.78 B: you know realistically i mean it it was about it was the only move there was to make and so 

452.43 460.36 A: oh but see i think that like if things are ever going to get better that needs to be not the only move there is to make there needs to be ah like a 

460.47 463.84 A: oh i don't know stereotypical thinking outside the box i guess or 

463.83 475.73 A: like a a more long term lighter thinking of some sort that can get beyond that if i mean not that that's easy clearly but if there's going to be any change 

476.13 477.01 A: um 

478.82 491.72 B: i guess that's true for my opinion i'm mu- i'm barely ah happy with the way ah things have things more or less how things have gone on with how we handled ah long term and we actually you know we were able to defeat 

491.71 498.47 B: ah or win the cold war if there if there was a winner and you know at least our government is still around i think like that so 

498.68 512.61 B: ah i guess long term we're still here and i think we're we're doing a good job the problem is is the way the the world has shrunk down there's not there's not the axis and allies there's i mean there's lily- i mean there's rogue nations and there's terrorists and things like that and it's 

512.49 525.64 B: and it is the dynamics are shifting immensely and so if we try and ah i think in one sense we are moving beyond the straight you know thinking outside the blocks ah from what we used to be you know if you want to go back like you know 

525.62 530.03 B: world war one world war two the cold war i mean things have definitely drastically changed 

529.97 543.02 B: ah as far as that's concerned and we're going to have to change more it's going to get more and more difficult as because it's the it's the things that we value most that make it so ease- that make us such an easy target it's our freedom of the borders it's 

543.03 553.58 B: the freedom of speech the freedom of movement that you will not have anywhere else is what makes us such a great target and so in some aspects we have to change ourselves and if if preemptive 

553.65 555.26 B: a preemptive strike 

555.30 557.36 B: (( i mean i i don't know )) 

557.44 558.13 B: (( i )) 

558.14 572.89 B: as looking at how things have turned out with the torture chambers we've found they've found mass graves and things like that even if there weren't any weapons of mass destruction which i think they will eventually find you know i mean how many people have we saved anything you know the funny thing is that we're not doing it for the glory 

572.88 581.46 B: the people in iraq already tell us that they want us out they don't want us there they don't like us and we and we knew that going in that they weren't going to like us they probably weren't going to have a sympathetic 

581.23 594.84 B: you know u._s. sympathetic government you know we're going to turn it back over to them and you know they'll end up being the benefits from you know i mean i don't know what how many you know as it was one hundred and forty two soldiers that have died so far you know in this 

594.74 596.56 A: and how ever many iraqis 

595.00 596.02 B: so i mean 

596.36 599.89 B: yeah well [mn] well yeah thousands of iraqis
