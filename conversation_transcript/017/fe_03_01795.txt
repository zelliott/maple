37.92 39.32 B: it's pretty cool 

39.71 43.10 A: so we're supposed to talk about computers in education 

42.78 43.69 B: right 

44.36 46.76 A: you go first [laughter] 

46.16 48.09 B: well do you have any kids 

48.01 49.25 A: no i don't 

48.64 49.80 B: okay 

49.87 54.57 B: 'cause i know that i i have four children i've only got two that are in school right now 

54.07 54.97 A: yes 

54.68 62.32 B: but i know that they go to like a computer lab slash class what at least once a week 

62.02 63.03 A: yes 

63.86 65.04 B: and 

65.96 71.71 B: i don't know i think computers everybody uses computer we got one two three three of them here in the house 

70.79 73.77 A: yes well you know do they 

74.03 84.77 A: in school i've always wondered this do they teach the kids how to use computers or do they just have computers available for the kids to use in their regular learning 

85.19 93.83 B: um both as far as i can see right now they have what's called a._r. testing where they have to actually read a book and then they take the test on the computer 

93.45 94.38 A: (( yes )) 

94.12 102.26 B: but then they also get to my son has made little ah little books with it where he's actually had to type in the script and 

102.59 105.90 B: put the graphics and everything in it and then print it out 

105.47 106.65 A: oh okay 

106.26 108.19 B: so he's actually creating 

108.97 113.22 B: i don't know what program they use but he's actually creating that 

111.05 111.97 A: (( right well that's )) 

113.73 117.21 B: as far as at home he gets on the internet and stuff 

117.01 118.67 A: nifty do they ever 

119.00 131.74 A: like ask you to have like a particular type of software on your computer at home so that so that they could do homework on their computer at home from the same program as they use at school and that sort of thing 

131.69 139.85 B: not specifically um they have said he could type you know like for a science project and stuff he's used word 

138.87 139.78 A: (( uh huh )) 

140.04 142.54 B: for his science project but it wasn't 

142.74 145.89 B: you know they didn't ask specifically for word 

145.52 147.14 A: yeah 

147.40 150.15 A: did they have computers when you went to school 

151.47 154.19 B: let me think [laughter] 

152.71 155.39 A: [laughter] 

154.38 161.40 B: yeah i think some of our office ah courses had computers but it was more word processing 

161.11 162.87 A: yeah 

162.07 163.53 B: as opposed to 

163.99 171.47 A: my first experience with computers was actually when i moved to san angelo and started at angelo state university 

164.19 165.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

170.93 172.45 B: mhm 

171.59 177.47 A: and one of the first things i wanted to do was take a computer class 'cause i had never touched one 

177.15 179.09 B: mhm 

177.99 179.74 A: and i'm in a wheelchair 

179.92 182.25 A: and these days 

182.96 189.18 A: i have to use voice recognition with my computer 'cause i can't use the keyboard or the mouse 

186.24 187.13 B: okay 

188.62 189.58 B: mhm 

189.34 194.31 A: and i thank goodness that i learned enough then 

194.33 202.10 A: at a._s._u. about computers that that you know i was ready whenever it came time that i needed to use the voice recognition 

201.82 205.68 B: right so you actually feel comfortable enough now to use that huh 

205.30 218.33 A: right exactly and and now um i'm retired from from real work but the work that i do at home i do on the computer using my voice recognition 

218.35 222.84 A: and i do it because of the you know what i was able to learn when i was in college 

222.32 223.35 B: right 

223.23 224.37 A: back then 

225.40 226.40 B: huh 

226.22 227.21 A: so 

226.95 228.41 B: that that's true 

228.46 237.76 A: i think it's so you can see from my perspective then that that computers are incredibly important and in education [laughter] 

236.28 238.11 B: yeah 

237.94 242.32 A: and i do think that i i'm the type of person that believes 

242.74 246.06 A: that more technology is almost always better 

245.73 247.81 B: oh yeah 

247.82 258.37 B: yeah i took um i think my first computer course in my freshman year and i don't remember doing that well on it [laughter] i think i got either a d. or a c. in the actual course 

254.47 255.61 A: right 

257.81 259.63 A: yeah where did you go 

260.00 263.01 B: i went to radford university in virginia 

262.72 264.33 A: i've heard of that 

264.44 267.78 B: probably it's near tech virginia tech 

266.22 267.17 A: (( uh huh )) 

267.88 270.61 B: yeah it's only a half hour from there 

271.38 276.45 A: yes in the the work that that i do now we have ah 

271.70 272.35 B: (( but )) 

276.62 282.32 A: we have people who represent our company all over the country and i think i've seen a resume 

279.61 280.64 B: right 

282.66 284.91 A: where someone went to school there 

284.57 286.31 B: (( uh huh okay )) 

287.39 289.87 B: yeah they're definitely important now 

289.59 290.61 A: yeah 

290.01 293.38 B: and it's good that the kids are actually using them in schools 

293.72 296.68 B: i know pretty much to go to college nowadays you have to have 

296.86 302.60 B: either a desk top or a laptop it seems to be seems to be almost a requirement 

298.58 299.90 A: do you really 

303.06 310.28 A: i mean i wouldn't want if i had a kid i certainly wouldn't want to send them there without one but but i didn't know that it was necessarily a requirement 

306.50 307.61 B: right 

309.78 313.38 B: i don't think they take ah handwritten papers anymore [laughter] 

313.02 314.42 A: are you kidding me 

313.75 315.97 B: no i do not think so 

315.57 316.93 A: oh wow 

316.55 321.36 B: no i think everything has to be typewritten and i don't see a whole lot of typewriters in the ah 

321.47 323.11 B: library or anything 

322.32 330.17 A: no [laughter] no our last typewriter wound up in the trash can not too many months ago 

329.69 331.24 B: (( exactly uh )) 

330.83 332.69 A: there's no point in it now 

332.28 333.19 B: huh 

334.29 338.89 A: even most forms you had to fill out you can get on line now 

340.63 345.42 B: right see we're in the military and half the stuff is downloadable forms 

345.11 346.26 A: yeah 

345.73 347.10 B: that you can fill in 

346.93 351.79 A: yeah so is is goodfellow air force base still there 

351.29 356.86 B: yes it is it's still here it's where my hubby's at right now 

352.27 353.65 A: well i'll be 

357.70 359.21 A: i had to ah 

359.86 361.00 A: um 

361.51 365.33 A: actually i believe one of my computer classes was on the base 

364.91 365.87 B: okay 

365.72 368.50 A: 'cause at that time when we were going to school there 

368.96 372.26 A: you know they had some of the a._s._u. classes on base 

371.87 373.78 B: mhm 

372.27 379.54 A: and we had to go out there to actually take some classes i believe that i one it seemed like they had a computer lab out there 

379.70 382.08 A: and that's where we took a class 

381.46 382.34 B: right 

382.60 389.90 B: see that's another thing they give you basic training when you're in the military as far as computers but you've pretty much got to 

390.11 394.06 B: either catch on really quick or you better know what you're doing before you get there 

394.57 400.37 A: right several parents have told me that their best source of training for computers is their kids 

400.03 408.54 B: yeah [laughter] yeah i've got an older type parent figure [laughter] that is calling me all the time from abeline 

400.56 402.25 A: [laughter] 

408.08 409.90 A: [laughter] 

408.81 410.69 B: to get help with the computer 

410.43 414.48 A: [laughter] are you from abeline 

414.62 418.21 B: i lived there for eighteen months at ah dias 

417.62 418.87 A: oh i see 

418.34 419.39 B: yeah 

419.03 419.92 A: (( yes )) 

420.44 422.84 B: so we kinda go everywhere i know that um 

423.27 428.79 B: we're going to italy this summer and if it weren't for email i'd have a real hard time keeping up with my family 

428.18 429.34 A: i'll bet 

430.26 433.38 A: yeah i'll i have a a friend that ah 

434.09 435.58 A: (( that ah )) 

435.81 442.80 A: he had a professional job and he just stopped all together and decided to become a truck driver 

442.97 443.99 B: wow 

443.42 450.18 A: and that's the way he communicates with his family now is through computers through email 

448.69 449.71 B: right 

450.71 454.82 B: yeah it seems like the cellphones are getting more computerized as well 

454.43 455.73 A: absolutely 

456.39 458.40 A: but i think it's all good 

456.47 457.60 B: i have 

458.35 468.94 B: yeah it's good to be able to just reach across and get in touch and like you said finding jobs and stuff on the internet i do some mystery shopping and merchandising and that's how i get my assignments 

468.51 473.32 A: did you find this listing on that thing that went out to everybody a couple of days ago 

473.76 476.58 B: i found it on leidlers lounge 

476.22 486.30 A: oh okay i would just you know i'm on all the mailing lists for mystery shopping 'cause my wife and i also do that occasionally not that much but just for fun 

480.24 481.42 B: right 

482.81 483.87 B: yeah 

486.42 489.20 B: yeah i notice sheryl durban sent one out 

488.77 491.23 A: yeah that's the one i responded to 

490.81 491.72 B: okay 

491.31 493.28 A: (( and that's how i got on this )) 

492.77 494.56 B: yep 

494.10 496.00 A: and my first thought was 

496.06 498.07 A: i wonder if this is legitimate 

498.26 504.04 B: oh of course [laughter] it sounds weird [laughter] 

498.97 499.96 A: and so 

500.87 507.76 A: i i checked it out [laughter] i was part of the university of pennsylvania so it's okay 

507.36 514.10 B: right i didn't even answer the phone yesterday i figured it was telemarketing or something from the university of p._a. 

514.31 520.12 A: the thing it rang once yesterday but it was gonna it was about foreign affair 

520.11 521.29 B: mm okay 

520.54 524.66 A: foreign policy and i just wasn't up to it yesterday 

522.17 522.87 B: (( mhm )) 

524.13 527.27 B: right i thought it said formulations or something 

527.02 528.76 A: oh okay 

527.96 529.49 B: and i was like what 

529.59 530.94 A: [laughter] 

529.93 532.41 B: how am i gonna talk ten minutes on formulations 

532.07 534.08 A: right yeah [laughter] 

534.13 536.26 A: but this is certainly interesting 

536.02 537.88 B: yeah i think so 

537.60 543.26 A: i read the web site about it and apparently they're using they're saving these files 

542.71 543.57 B: right 

543.29 546.74 A: and they are using this information to develop 

547.03 550.53 A: ah you know improvements in voice recognition 

550.58 554.28 A: and text to speech technology 

553.79 555.85 B: oh great 

554.57 557.96 A: yeah so i was really interested when i heard about that 

557.43 561.03 B: yeah you always want to help forward that kind of stuff then 

560.30 561.72 A: yeah exactly 

561.16 562.62 B: that's your field 

562.75 564.79 A: absolutely 

565.28 567.69 A: i wonder when that eight minutes is coming 

567.30 568.66 B: (( i don't know )) 

567.91 570.11 A: [laughter] 

569.50 574.02 B: [laughter] there's only so much we can say yeah we agree you know 

571.09 571.75 A: [laughter] 

572.94 575.11 A: (( exactly )) 

574.33 575.93 B: it's a good step 

576.19 578.59 B: and we're surrounded by it daily so 

578.63 580.19 B: you can't get away from it 

580.08 581.29 A: that's right 

580.75 581.55 B: (( you know )) 

582.24 589.70 B: i'm even looking at getting a laptop so we can when we travel this summer you know i can keep doing shops along the way and 

588.25 589.14 A: yes 

589.59 591.10 A: now that would be fun 

591.09 596.43 B: so that's the next thing i'm learning is wireless technology when you're travelling you know where can i plug it in 

596.43 597.46 A: yeah 

598.26 599.89 B: so i've gotta find out how to do that
