15.72 16.64 B: no 

16.56 20.97 A: oh yeah the they email and they say some kind of delay or something like that 

17.25 18.20 B: (( ye- )) 

20.43 22.03 B: (( oh yeah )) 

21.50 22.59 A: yeah 

21.99 35.72 B: okay 'cause i had emailed them asking about it and they told me about a week or so back that they would send it but still haven't seen it [laughter] but that's that's cool what was the um the topic was do you consider any other country's a threat 

27.47 28.34 A: oh 

33.24 34.26 A: (( [mn] yes )) 

35.33 40.20 A: yeah the topic is like in your mind do you think any other country's a threat to the rest of us 

40.05 41.02 B: hm 

41.15 43.20 B: in the middle east let's see 

41.20 42.00 A: oh 

42.52 45.81 A: yeah well i mean not now 

44.43 48.30 B: i'm not real sure i mean they are but it's hard for me to put my 

48.75 56.41 B: you know to pinpoint which ones you know because i guess i don't really know what's going on or who to trust you know when you hear things 

55.43 61.19 A: yeah i i mean uh now the middle east i mean you know iraq war is almost over 

60.62 62.23 B: yeah 

61.88 66.18 A: i think our biggest threat right now is north korea since they have 

65.37 68.13 B: oh yeah i agree 

66.60 68.83 A: since they have like a lot of nukes 

68.79 72.27 B: yeah and they don't seem too shy about um [laughter] 

71.87 74.68 A: yeah and like um they 

75.06 78.44 A: i mean they they you know they display them you know 

77.83 79.52 B: yeah i know i mean 

79.62 81.23 B: like blatantly 

81.32 83.54 B: it almost like it's um 

83.69 87.89 B: being antagonistic you know the kind of comments that they make 

85.38 86.50 A: yeah 

87.65 88.71 A: yeah 

88.00 94.38 B: but i don't know do you do you think that iraq is a threat even after the war i mean yeah 

92.41 99.01 A: iraq well i mean like depend on how you know we set up their i mean we allow their um 

99.64 105.78 A: depend on how their government going to be set up you know i mean if they if i mean they yeah 

101.55 103.19 B: yeah yeah 

104.46 118.68 B: 'cause that's kinda shaky to me i think it's um you know everything's kinda still in the air and there's a whole lot of protesters over there about us even being there now you know and so that kinda seems a little bit strange but 

109.40 110.40 A: yeah 

113.95 115.87 A: yeah 

118.44 119.48 A: yeah 

118.77 120.49 B: what about syria 

120.90 122.51 A: (( what )) 

120.98 123.93 B: what do you what do you think about them do you think they're a threat 

123.96 125.81 A: s- s- syria 

125.20 126.18 B: yeah 

126.70 132.20 A: well you know what to be honest i haven't heard anything about syria what what happened what happened in syria mhm 

130.09 133.01 B: oh really well they were saying on 

133.12 145.20 B: the news like for the last week or so they had been saying that some of the um government officials in iraq had fled and the only place they could have gone was syria and that um the u._s. government knew of one 

145.03 148.26 B: person that syria was harboring and they they um 

148.37 151.83 B: kind of i mean not really threatened them but they kind of said you know 

151.94 160.47 B: there would be i guess threatened them there would be some type of pre- uh repercussions for harboring them because they were considered war criminals and things 

160.54 168.91 B: but um and then one of them uh syria talked one um of them into giving himself up and it was uh a stepson one of saddam's stepsons 

168.08 169.67 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

168.99 179.42 B: and uh so it proved they were saying the whole time well there's no-one here we're not harboring anyone but then they turn around and actually had talked someone into giving themselves up which they did so 

179.41 188.41 B: you know it kinda makes them look like you know big liars you know [laughter] i mean if you weren't harboring them then how could you have talked them into giving themselves up you know 

180.09 181.03 A: oh 

183.36 184.72 A: oh yeah 

187.99 189.83 A: yeah yeah 

188.61 201.90 B: but i mean we've kinda it's kinda backed off of them but i just wonder about 'em you know why would they if they're such supporters of the iraqi people why would they well even harbor anyone in that regime you know 

201.27 202.87 A: yeah yeah 

202.17 203.07 B: but 

203.27 205.97 A: well i mean you know i 

206.18 206.83 A: ch- 

207.04 214.87 A: if the u._s. government just you know just demand the uh you know don't don't take any like military action just you know 

215.09 218.53 A: like like tell the um 

219.32 221.63 A: the nato you know 

221.23 222.55 B: oh yeah 

221.83 224.96 A: i think the best thing to do is just like confirm with the nato 

224.60 225.60 B: uh-huh 

225.00 230.65 A: that trying to prove that iraq iraqi have have mass destruction weapons 

229.91 231.08 B: yeah 

230.98 237.88 A: and then um just just you know t- so then try and convince nato to support us 

237.48 238.60 B: yeah 

237.98 246.32 A: then once nato support us the pressure going to be much more on um syria to give up whoever they are harboring 

243.44 244.45 B: yeah 

245.62 248.00 B: oh yeah yeah 'cause 

246.36 249.85 A: you know then that will put a lot more pressure on them 

249.14 252.55 B: yeah and it would be better to come from another um 

252.56 266.70 B: instead of it directly coming from the united states you know it seems like it would be better to have it coming from uh the support you know the supporters you know because we don't have a real good reputation right now internationally but 

255.01 256.01 A: yeah 

260.64 261.75 A: yeah 

262.26 263.38 A: (( yeah )) 

265.12 266.14 A: yeah 

266.41 267.50 A: yeah 

266.86 273.47 B: you know i don't think i think that what we did was right but i do think that they need to come up with some of these weapons 

267.58 268.18 A: (( mhm )) 

273.29 274.84 A: yeah yeah 

273.98 283.74 B: you know 'cause it's not looking too good [laughter] not finding them is not looking real great m- m- my cousin is over there right now and he's right on the front lines 

276.46 277.92 A: yeah definitely 

279.34 280.32 A: yeah 

283.13 284.55 A: oh really 

283.91 292.45 B: yeah and uh [mn] but i mean you know he's okay and everything i think um my aunt has probably heard from him by now but 

284.61 285.54 A: okay 

292.87 298.48 B: you know when all all the stuff was going on you couldn't help but think about him a lot you know 

296.73 297.56 A: oh 

298.03 302.29 A: it it so he's all right did did he did he get into action or anything 

301.71 315.70 B: oh yeah he was a special ops marine right on the front lines so he was [mn] when he was giving his aunt uh his my aunt his mother information about um where he was it was where he had been you know 

305.72 307.66 A: wow wow 

315.67 319.02 B: sounds all you know they were real secretive about all of that so 

316.33 317.34 A: oh 

317.92 321.98 A: yeah they they they they they didn't want people to know [mn] wow 

320.07 329.90 B: yeah when he told he told them that they were moving in uh like within a week and like the very new day was the day they actually moved in so 

329.21 330.29 A: wow 

329.94 336.76 B: you know they had to be secretive about it but he definitely has been involved it'd be interesting to talk to him when he gets back 

336.53 338.25 A: yeah wow 

337.57 344.62 B: you know and i wonder you know how long it's gonna take for some of them to come back i guess that's the thing with iraq is you know 

343.50 352.62 A: yeah yeah i think now they just like they keep the soldier out there to like keep you know keep the um keep the government from getting back up again yeah mhm 

351.95 354.01 B: yeah yeah 

354.15 358.63 B: you know what though this is interesting to me and this is from woman's perspective 

354.34 355.03 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

358.86 360.76 B: uh all of the uh 

360.87 364.91 B: the [mn] protests that are going on in iraq right now 

365.10 370.44 B: about um how they don't want to set up a democracy they don't want to vote you know 

370.35 379.48 B: uh they said uh they had all these men out there that i mean a lot like thousands and thousands of men protesting that um 

379.31 389.34 B: the marines back out of baghdad which is what they've done now but this was before that they were protesting then that they wanted to set up their own government and they didn't wanna just have a democracy 

389.38 395.67 B: and uh which is strange they didn't want to vote but i guess you know they've they've never done that before so 

394.52 396.35 A: mhm mhm yeah so i mean 

395.89 396.79 B: (( you know )) 

396.48 399.42 A: anything new to them they'll they just afraid mhm 

398.77 407.25 B: yeah i think so too but you know it was interesting to me that they aren't in all of those people that were protesting there wasn't one woman protesting 

407.29 418.55 B: and um what they were protesting was democracy and the right to vote you know so it so it kinda seemed like to me that they didn't want their their culture as far as 

418.48 427.53 B: uh the freedom of women and all of that to change very much you know because you didn't see any women and of freedom you know [laughter] over there 

423.00 423.85 A: yeah 

427.30 428.16 A: yeah 

427.39 438.29 B: and um so i think it'll be better over there but i still don't think it's going to be uh equal freedom for everybody and it's it's seriously not going to be religious freedom you 

438.16 439.85 A: (( yeah )) 

438.80 449.81 B: know the shiites are the ones that are demonstrating now because they've been oppressed for so long and even the people are kind of against them now because it's been you know thirty years since they've even been able to 

449.89 451.12 B: to 

451.19 452.89 B: (( demonstrate you know )) 

452.95 455.24 B: so it's going to be hard for the two 

455.27 458.81 B: muslim beliefs to even i think 

455.27 456.19 A: yeah 

458.90 461.42 B: you know mold over there but 

459.54 460.46 A: yeah 

461.47 463.53 A: yeah that's [noise] that's true yeah i 

462.91 474.86 B: i agree with you about north korea though i think that out of everyone over there i think they are our largest threat because of the type of weapons that they have and they're admitting it you know they're just [mn] they got 'em you know 

469.07 469.91 A: (( mean 'cause )) 

474.34 480.81 A: i mean 'cause they're they're really capable of like you know blowing up a whole country i mean 

477.73 478.86 B: oh yeah 

479.36 480.34 B: yeah 

480.53 483.85 B: that's really really frightening and that's you know 

483.87 497.16 B: the way it started was it was that um they had opened that plant just for electricity and now they've announced that they are going to um start uh i don't know what the word is re- reusing the um the the 

495.31 496.23 A: (( [noise] mhm mhm )) 

497.24 506.93 B: the rods the type of fuel for nuclear weapons and uh and that was like right before these discussions were supposed to start between some of the countries 

506.75 508.11 A: yeah 

507.39 512.11 B: so it's kind of like you know even though we're gonna talk we're still gonna do what we're gonna do and it 

512.18 519.52 B: just seems it is kind of frightening because you think about that what can you do to protect yourself from a nuclear weapon 

515.91 516.87 A: yeah 

519.19 523.91 A: [mn] yeah yeah i mean there's nothing i mean dig a big hole and jump down there 

520.68 521.45 B: [sigh] 

523.00 526.15 B: (( [laughter] )) 

525.75 527.64 A: [laughter] and just pray 

527.17 534.34 B: [laughter] yeah i know that's it [laughter] that or be really really nice to the 

531.04 532.10 A: yeah 

535.55 544.91 B: which i think you know i'm a supporter you know of our government whether it's republican or democrat whatever 'cause i think you know we should we should still support our government but 

544.38 545.53 A: yeah 

545.02 548.99 B: man i don't see them being nice [laughter] about it 

547.42 548.41 A: yeah 

548.78 549.72 A: yeah 

549.06 551.24 B: because our president seems to be kind of 

552.35 556.21 B: (( um i don't know hot headed [laughter] )) 

554.58 555.53 A: yeah 

555.64 562.85 A: i mean [mn] i mean we anything if anything i mean we have to have the you know the nato support 

562.40 565.11 B: yeah i think so too especially now 

562.95 565.01 A: i mean if we if we gonna 

565.26 575.53 A: if we're going to take away the north korea weapons i mean we need the nato support 'cause you know i mean they have something maybe we should try and go in there and do what we did for iraq but i mean 

568.49 569.79 B: yeah 

575.27 581.62 B: oh that's not i don't think that's gonna work in north korea [laughter] i mean iraq was a country 

581.57 592.29 B: i mean they're not a poor country but they didn't have a lot of the capabilities military wise that we have so it was a fairly i mean easy war easy being 

585.88 586.98 A: yeah 

592.30 594.53 B: you know that it was a quick war you know 

594.03 595.66 A: yeah 

594.79 599.65 B: but i i think it would be totally different in north korea you know 

598.19 599.25 A: (( yeah yeah ))
