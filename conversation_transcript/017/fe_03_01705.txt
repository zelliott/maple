0.25 2.22 B: hi my name is janice 

1.51 3.61 A: hi i'm susan how you doing 

3.22 4.64 B: good how are you 

4.17 5.23 A: okay 

4.88 13.87 B: i guess we're supposed to talk about uh other countries [noise] [lipsmack] um i think there's a lot of countries that are a threat to the united states at the time [lipsmack] how 'bout you 

7.58 8.84 A: yeah 

14.71 18.99 A: a threat to us [sigh] i don't know ah 

19.52 21.91 A: i guess it depends on 

22.14 23.60 A: i i don't think there 

22.75 24.77 B: i guess we have to define threat 

24.29 26.99 A: yeah that that would be good starting place 

26.00 27.80 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

27.12 32.72 A: as far as terrorism is concerned i don't think there's any protection from it 

32.93 35.13 A: really and i uh 

34.96 42.72 B: well i have a tendency to agree with that um except that in certain instances i think that um if you have enough information 

35.23 35.79 A: (( [noise] )) 

42.77 46.43 B: it sometimes it helps to be proactive as opposed to reactive 

47.80 49.08 B: i guess you don't 

50.06 51.16 B: don't agree 

50.12 53.22 A: yeah yeah no i do i do um 

53.31 55.42 B: well how do you feel about this war in iraq 

56.42 60.36 A: i don't think we ever should've gone there personally um 

59.32 60.42 B: okay 

60.48 61.48 B: why not 

65.39 74.94 A: i don't believe we have the right to tell another country who should be running it any more than they have the right to tell us who should be running us 

74.81 75.89 B: mhm 

75.29 76.23 A: i 

77.51 81.14 B: do you think that saddam hussein was a threat uh for terrorism to our country 

83.34 87.20 A: no if he had the kind of weapons that we've been accusing him of he would've used 'em 

87.15 88.28 B: you think so 

87.79 91.66 A: yep uh what reason did he have to hold back 

91.85 94.74 A: everything was lost at that point he might as well have gotten even 

94.80 96.23 B: oh at this point you mean 

96.65 98.64 B: [noise] once we went in you're talking about 

97.37 102.36 A: once we went in once went in we went in he had no excuse not to use 'em if he had 'em 

102.02 112.30 B: mhm well well that that's definitely a problem the united states has [laughter] this tim- at this point is proving w- you know whether or not they they actually existed and if they did where were they 

102.63 103.66 A: and he didn't 

106.91 108.12 A: (( yeah )) 

111.75 115.15 A: exactly i i think that oh back 

115.35 120.26 A: when carter got a got at the c._i._a. it was the biggest mistake we could've made 

117.73 118.67 B: mhm 

120.53 126.97 A: um since then our i mean our intelligence services weren't that great before that but since then they've just been dreadful 

126.83 139.25 B: oh i think that that's definitely a given i think that you know they had a lot of information before nine eleven in this country that was not addressed um i think that there's a lot of information out there now that's not necessarily [laughter] addressed um 

138.25 139.04 A: (( yep )) 

140.01 152.71 B: [noise] a- as far as the united states being at risk i i think the only risk we really have is terrorism at this point i don't think there's a country on the planet that could um match us military for military 

152.21 154.74 A: there i'll agree yeah definitely 

153.56 161.51 B: you know unless of course you wanna just you know go bomb for bomb and we're all gone [laughter] you know unfortunately that's that's where we are technology wise 

156.86 158.69 A: [laughter] 

160.79 162.41 A: mhm 

161.70 167.40 B: but um you know we we've definitely had a history of sticking our nose where it didn't belong 

166.94 170.64 A: oh yeah and we haven't made a lot of friends in the process 

167.69 168.71 B: [lipsmack] but 

170.01 176.11 B: uh well you know i'm i really have not traveled out of the united states too much to 

176.38 182.59 B: know that but i do know from people that have that the obviously there's a lot of anti american sentiment 

181.95 185.18 A: yeah i i've traveled quite a bit outside so yeah uh 

184.22 185.18 B: mhm 

185.56 190.30 B: i i think that you know unfortunately though i think as far as terrorism terrorism is concerned 

190.67 194.85 B: unfortunately i think we are a great risk um we would never you know 

195.17 198.41 B: settle the the you know osama bin laden situation 

198.05 198.83 A: no 

198.53 200.85 B: and afghanistan i don't know if we ever will 

200.36 205.69 A: no that's why we i think we part why we turned to saddam hussein he was somebody we could get 

205.21 207.87 B: mhm oh that that is definitely you know 

207.05 208.29 A: good distraction 

208.45 217.44 B: yes and it's definitely we've at least done something you know people feel like at least that something has been done whether it's good or bad [laughter] you know something has been done 

210.69 211.88 A: yeah 

214.89 216.25 A: yeah [mn] 

217.44 228.66 B: um other than that i mean you know this north korea stuff i mean i i just don't see you know why these people would go ahead and attack us but then again i didn't understand why nine eleven happened so hey 

230.03 230.71 A: (( [mn] [sigh] )) 

231.01 237.21 A: yeah well a lot of nine eleven has to do with the the american attitude towards the rest of the world 

237.51 238.21 A: (( we )) 

237.72 246.32 B: i know but the people in that those buildings had nothing to do with that and if you have a problem with the with the you know government in this country that's one issue but to deal w- you know 

240.40 241.38 A: no 

246.33 250.57 B: with civilians to me you know is a totally different situation 

250.23 251.54 A: yeah 

250.91 254.10 B: and you know although i don't know um 

254.57 264.12 B: y- know i don't i waffle on the issue of iraq but i do know that you know unfortunately or fortunately you know saddam hussein didn't come clean for twelve years 

263.52 264.96 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

264.07 269.85 B: you know and that put him in a position where at any time during those twelve years he could've okay 

270.08 278.24 B: you know so if he what was his reason for not just 'cause he said i don't care i mean he had to know that we were coming eventually 

276.06 277.09 A: because 

278.29 280.42 B: you know certainly at this point he had to know [lipsmack] 

280.89 295.26 A: because he was a sovereign nation and i don't know how much right we had to be telling him what he could do and what he couldn't do we wouldn't stand the for that from anybody else hell we won't even acknowledge the international court of justice because we won't have anybody telling us what to do and what not to do 

295.09 296.38 B: (( well that would that would )) 

295.34 296.99 A: where do we get off 

296.75 305.72 B: well that's that's definitely you know definitely a point that we didn't listen to the you know court of justice and we said we were doing it anyway no matter what we were told um 

304.70 307.94 A: exactly how does that make us any better than him [sigh] 

305.81 306.49 B: (( [mn] )) 

307.94 314.11 B: well you know i- it does and it doesn't it doesn't because obviously you know we've been as aggressive at that point as he 

314.39 322.22 B: we think he c- was going to be or or somewhere near but by the same token at least we tried to you know use some 

322.30 323.94 B: [lipsmack] sense of [mn] 

324.72 325.29 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

325.31 328.42 B: what's the word i'm looking for some sense of uh [lipsmack] 

328.46 337.72 B: stability or or you know conscience when we did go in that it wasn't just random you know shoot 'em up you know drop a bomb and that's the end of baghdad kind of thing 

336.66 337.54 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

337.73 338.90 A: yeah 

340.32 344.89 B: [lipsmack] are there any other countries that you feel you know would would be are a threat to this country 

345.59 351.95 A: again on a military basis no i i think at this point we're too strong um for 

352.16 354.15 A: the military to be a threat 

354.39 361.84 A: and as far as terrorism goes as i said there's no protecting against it hell i can walk into my kitchen and make mustard gas 

362.15 363.26 A: (( [sigh] that's )) 

362.52 365.72 B: oh absolutely and and you certainly can get that information on the internet 

363.44 367.59 A: yeah so how do you protect against that and you don't even need it just mix um 

367.65 368.90 A: bleach and ammonia 

368.61 370.44 B: [laughter] 

368.93 371.12 A: [laughter] wham you got mustard gas 

371.24 377.76 A: uh [laughter] and then of course with the information on the internet it starts getting even easier it it's just 

376.08 377.07 B: mhm 

378.46 388.17 A: from that there's no protection i i don't care how many of our civil liberties they take away i don't care how badly they destroy the constitution they're not protecting us from terrorism 

388.74 392.89 B: so you think that there is nothing to do just to sit back and say that's the way it is 

392.63 393.84 A: (( no [lipsmack] )) 

394.78 396.37 B: well what would you suggest then 

399.11 408.16 B: you know i mean i i i'm not necessarily you know uh a hundred percent [mn] for behind this war in iraq but i do believe that there's a time where 

404.93 406.22 A: yeah 

408.09 421.51 B: um you have to say you know what we've been reactive for so long as a country and militarily obviously we have the power but we've we've also not ing- you know we've gotten involved obviously where we shouldn't have you know more times than not 

419.82 420.53 A: yeah 

421.06 422.16 A: (( yeah )) 

421.55 435.72 B: in in different governmental situations but in situations where we've had intelligence where there's a possibility that we are going to be somewhat attacked whether it's you know terrorism or not you know i do think that you have to at some point be proactive especially after [noise] 

434.95 441.49 A: i i think the first thing we have to do is rebuild the intelligence community so that they're getting straight information 

442.49 445.13 A: and getting complete information because 

444.46 450.83 B: well i don't think you as a civilian will ever or me as a civilian for that matter will ever you know be privy to any of the stuff oh 

449.70 454.55 A: oh i'm not asking to be privy to it i just want the intelligence community be privy to it 

452.25 458.88 B: i think a lot of people were you know i think that's a that's a problem that we had here is i think that a lotta people wanted too much information 

458.91 464.07 B: and you know we we weren't forthcoming with it then when and i don't think we should've been you know as long as they know what's going on 

463.60 464.69 A: yeah 

464.11 465.93 B: you know that's enough for me 

465.26 471.22 A: but i really don't don't think we have a good intelligence community in this country 

466.47 467.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

471.49 472.73 A: (( i- it's )) 

473.00 478.56 A: oh first off just the fact that they don't know foreign languages 

478.76 483.37 A: is such a handicap to any sort of information collection 

480.94 481.83 B: mhm 

483.95 490.40 A: um that's that's one place i i've i was very involved with the iranian community here 

485.04 486.34 B: well i i can't 

490.18 491.20 B: mhm 

490.59 502.31 A: and that is one place where the russians have always beat us hollow they had people in iran who spoke farsi fluently and they passed as natives at the time of the fall of the shah for instance 

499.43 500.39 B: mhm 

501.93 503.05 B: right 

502.41 505.60 A: we had no one who even had a vague knowledge of persian 

505.46 506.52 B: mhm 

505.84 507.71 A: (( how do you collect information )) 

507.43 517.54 B: well i can't imagine that [laughter] i mean if farsi is the national language there then that's the [mn] you know obviously in order to get any information you need to be able to communicate one would assume 

509.01 511.02 A: and it's gotten no better 

515.33 521.82 A: yeah i exact- that's so i would assume that that's the very first place to start let's start educating them in languages 

521.45 522.42 B: mhm 

522.02 523.55 A: and then we can 

523.79 527.30 A: start getting better information to make our judgments on them 

526.98 528.04 B: mhm 

528.30 529.59 B: did you live in iran 

529.61 530.91 A: no no 

531.45 534.60 B: oh it sounded like you had spent some some time there 

531.79 533.14 A: (( but i've i've got )) 

534.03 536.50 A: no i've i've got friends that uh 

536.68 538.16 A: were all iranian 

538.04 539.07 B: mhm 

538.51 543.80 A: and uh one of them for instance was in journalism and uh 

543.84 546.97 A: they knew an awful lot that wasn't getting out to the public 

544.90 545.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

546.81 548.13 B: mhm 

547.73 548.67 A: (( um )) 

548.81 551.06 A: we've talked a lot about it over the years 

551.63 552.65 A: uh 

552.95 558.51 A: and that that's a major failing of the the intelligence community in this country they just 

557.37 558.56 B: mhm 

558.53 563.37 A: don't speak the language yeah so how can you collect information without the information 

558.98 560.25 B: it's the language 

563.86 564.91 B: right 

564.13 565.10 A: uh 

565.14 566.48 A: and where do you go from there 

566.57 576.24 B: uh yeah i could see that being a problem [laughter] i could definitely see that being an issue um not being able to you know speak the language or collect the information um 

568.61 569.41 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

576.13 580.07 A: yeah so i think that's the first thing we've really got to do to protect ourselves from anything 

579.87 591.90 B: mhm [lipsmack] i just [mn] i just can't imagine you know a a milita- or you know you say you can't imagine but then something like september eleventh happens and you wonder obviously no country would attack us because you know where to go 

591.57 592.74 A: mhm 

592.10 599.89 B: but these cou- these groups that you know [mn] are angry with us for whatever reason okay uh whether their reason has validity or not 

596.58 597.67 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] ))
