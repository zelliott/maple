18.49 23.93 A: oh wow yeah pot- up in west texas that's for sure yeah 

21.63 24.88 B: there you go [laughter] a small world 

24.68 26.41 A: yeah love it um 

25.88 34.25 B: so okay let's see we're supposed to be talking about um if there's any country that we feel is a threat to the united states right now i think korea is 

34.31 36.38 A: i think so that uh 

36.60 38.63 A: that's the one that's scary 

38.26 39.66 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

38.61 42.08 A: and my we were teasing the other day about france 

42.01 55.21 A: [laughter] [laughter] what a tease yeah they're crazy it seems like yes i i north korea also i was i kinda think china it's always laying in uh 

42.21 43.59 B: oh jeeze the 

44.40 45.40 B: idiots 

49.53 50.46 B: uh-huh 

53.05 54.16 B: mhm 

55.93 57.18 A: in wait 

56.97 57.92 B: uh-huh 

57.27 63.40 A: but the north koreans seem like they're close to psychotics you know when you read the papers 

63.16 77.01 B: well he the guy i think truly is um the things that i've read about him are very scary and to think that somebody like that is running a country and that everybody is gonna follow him sort of like saddam um is a pretty scary thing 

77.11 78.78 B: he's [laughter] 

79.12 80.11 B: um 

80.13 90.00 B: he's quite a hedonist um and really does anything to satisfy his own wishes and um you know at the cost of all of his countrymen and he's 

89.97 96.83 B: getting nuclear ability and i think he's just a little scary at this point since he's so unstable 

96.69 100.49 A: i hear ya uh it it seems to me 

100.70 114.55 A: uh that he he seems to be the worst perhaps some of the other mid-east countries but they don't seem to have capabilities uh you know that scare us as much as as uh north korea for sure 

109.49 110.74 B: right 

113.96 115.80 B: right yeah 

115.27 116.12 A: it's 

116.75 117.69 A: (( uh i don't )) 

117.53 118.46 B: um 

117.82 128.56 A: know it's intriguing that uh and really i'm just reading some news magazine where in they said that ch- that china and north korea had at least started talking 

128.45 133.04 A: uh it was saying that after they'd seen how quickly the u._s. defeated this 

132.97 133.94 B: right 

133.20 136.39 A: this deal and et cetera et cetera but it's still 

136.66 144.58 A: it's such a scary thing i think that's what i've finding the unsurety of it and it used to be when i was younger i'd be saying well 

144.82 155.66 A: i know this or you know you feel this really stronger now it's just like any day you're kinda scared that some yo-yo's gonna do this or that or whatever i think that's what i'm becoming scared of you know 

153.33 154.14 B: right 

155.46 156.36 B: right 

156.41 166.17 B: i guess there's part of me that's hoping that have them having seen what we're capable of that perhaps they won't put themselves in a position where 

166.22 172.08 B: we'll be even talking about coming to their country and and chatting you know [laughter] 

171.10 177.27 A: um right and i in fact that's what this newsweek i think it was i was just reading this afternoon it just came 

177.23 190.41 A: and and it was saying that that that it's maybe it'll make 'em stop and think twice because before you know we've always for quite a time we've not done too too much or we've uh done a different 

178.97 179.98 B: oh good 

188.63 189.51 B: threatened 

190.86 192.65 A: and never done anything so 

191.89 202.08 B: right well you know one of the first things you learn about children and discipline is that you don't say it if you don't mean it because then it becomes meaningless [noise] so 

192.83 193.55 A: (( i )) 

202.25 203.90 B: oh there's one little one 

203.95 211.71 B: so i and i think that that's what we had been for so long is we're just all talk and we didn't do anything and so nobody believed us and 

211.82 212.71 B: um 

212.77 214.09 B: then the whole 

214.57 222.09 B: stuff with saddam happened and i think maybe now they believe us so maybe that will make us safer in the long run i don't know i guess that's what i hope 

221.89 224.98 A: well and i'm with you yeah i it's like uh 

225.54 235.61 A: this whole uh uh newsweek magazine i was reading gosh it was talking about hitler's rise to power and what saddam did and was and is and how 

234.13 235.14 B: mhm 

235.84 239.16 A: apparently in the mid eastern sector and as you were saying 

239.16 248.73 A: a lot of the heads of state are just despots just awful just tacky just horrible you know and we're i know and see we all sit here 

243.56 244.43 B: right 

245.24 246.55 B: and that's scary 

248.73 255.70 A: [mn] you and i think generally it's sounds like and everybody does that it's just a rational thing that you don't really go crazy 

255.25 256.25 B: [laughter] 

256.07 259.45 A: yet you start looking this this whole issue was about 

259.56 266.26 A: all the palaces and what they found was saddam and the sons and all this and it's god it's like so so 

261.48 262.36 B: right 

264.01 264.99 B: right 

266.40 269.27 A: unfamiliar thing yeah 

266.80 271.49 B: bizarre well and that they had starving people it's sort of like god 

271.96 278.12 B: it's hard to really believe that there are some people who truly don't get it about what life is all about and 

276.25 278.71 A: yeah yeah yeah 

278.70 279.50 B: so 

278.88 288.39 A: well it sounds like you and i really [laughter] have quite a bit of the same feelings because for me i get confused as to why people can't really see 

283.15 284.71 B: (( for these systems yeah )) 

288.48 292.10 A: that we're not as bad as as 

291.63 292.67 B: yeah 

292.72 297.66 A: people just end up say- people over there end up saying so that's confusing to me you know 

295.86 296.84 B: well 

297.55 305.33 B: yeah i i i find myself frustrated we have people on the corners holding up signs that say honk for peace and it's like 

305.34 305.90 B: (( [mn] )) 

305.84 312.68 B: they were doing that at the beginning of the war and i guess i just hoped that they had been putting up signs that said honk for our troops and support 

312.56 320.93 B: our kids that are going over giving us the freedom that allows you to be standing out there on that corner putting up your sign in the first place 

317.45 319.20 A: yeah 

321.00 324.67 B: i i mean i wouldn't want my you know i don't want anybody to go to war but 

324.60 338.91 B: the fact that we were willing to go over there and help out those countries and for the you know this country and that our kids were are died for it and and then for people to put up those signs it just really hurt my feelings that they didn't quite understand 

336.10 338.60 A: yeah yeah it's just awful 

339.01 339.99 B: one of the 

339.02 350.57 A: [laughter] you you oughta see down here we live uh in austin it's probably about thirty miles from the or forty from the uh fort hood base where a lot of them deployed out of 

348.33 349.22 B: uh-huh 

349.95 351.00 B: oh 

350.83 360.11 A: and like thirty miles from president bush's new ranch or whatever well they're still protesting here and and you can see 

355.35 356.29 B: oh 

360.45 367.67 A: i guess it's so any place people just get really mad but i i get i don't i've had to really watch myself 

367.49 377.75 A: because people start doing that and on the next census you know somebody whose son's over there or whatever and it's just it's it's crazy you know [laughter] 

369.76 370.81 B: yeah 

373.17 374.06 B: right 

374.10 375.11 B: right 

376.49 387.00 B: my husband said he had a patient whose son was deployed and he was she was talking about it and somebody came up to and said so how does it feel to have a murderer for a son 

386.81 390.46 A: holy god oh wow oh that's awful it'd 

387.83 395.38 B: isn't that horrid here this poor woman is terrified about her son going over there and then here's some jerk off [laughter] comes over 

394.95 396.11 A: just man 

395.91 397.61 B: oh it's just horrid 

396.66 399.66 A: you know that's one of the awfulest i've ever heard i 

400.84 403.49 A: i was in i was in vietnam when 

400.99 402.13 B: i don't know where they 

403.15 404.08 B: were you 

404.01 406.25 A: yeah when friends came back 

406.44 408.47 A: i i never had this 

408.63 419.14 A: 'cause texas didn't seem to be a hot bed of liberalism i don't suppose but i had friends that people were doing that stuff to 'em when they come and said you're a murderer and you're this and that 

412.09 413.27 B: yeah 

419.00 429.83 A: and i how you'd really keep that lady would keep from you know violence to toward that other person which i don't ever talk that way you know it's just like oh man yeah that's awful that's crazy 

423.54 424.48 B: yeah 

426.12 426.93 B: sure 

427.11 427.98 B: sure 

428.55 436.15 B: i think she was just shocked because i said gosh gar what did she do and he said he said i don't think she said anything because i don't think she knew what to say 

435.69 441.77 A: oh wow i it's almost like she had two choices i've not heard anything quite that bad you know g- that's awful 

439.38 440.69 B: isn't that horrid 

441.35 448.09 B: yeah i can't even imagine but oh back to that thi- uh north korea leader you know one of the things that i read about him that's scary 

443.00 443.93 A: she just 

447.93 458.35 B: just to say how nutty he is is that any family there that had triplets he would come in and take the kids away saying that um he was afraid that they wouldn't have enough money to raise them 

447.96 448.75 A: huh 

458.56 465.85 B: um but in reality he had a some psychic tell him that a triplet was gonna take him from power 

465.60 468.43 A: oh lord it sounds biblical doesn't it 

466.25 467.04 B: so 

467.78 476.28 B: yeah so he's coming in and raising the they're putting the kids in an orphanage and telling them that um raising them to revere him 

468.66 470.18 A: golly 

476.39 477.27 B: um 

477.20 492.12 B: but it it doesn't pan out because they're taking rich people who have triplets poor people who have triplets so you know there's no real he can't really justify that's what he's doing it's the whole psychic thing of him being terrified he's gonna be brought down by a triplet so 

492.03 493.32 B: he's truly nuts 

493.42 495.41 A: gosh that's just crazy [laughter] 

494.78 499.86 B: yeah so [laughter] so i think we got we're gonna have to deal with them at some point but 

500.10 506.61 B: i'm hoping it's later and they maybe will learn a few lessons before we it gets too too bad 

500.39 501.64 A: yeah 

505.82 509.80 A: yeah i think that's what i'm hoping for for sure because uh 

510.27 516.19 A: i guess that's the scary thing the more you read about um what kind of people these are 

515.77 516.77 B: (( right [cough] )) 

516.39 519.73 A: and how their values or some words similar like that 

520.26 524.51 A: way that are so different from ours their thought patterns i guess 

524.05 525.46 B: (( right yes )) 

524.53 528.68 A: you know it's like [laughter] i guess oh so i don't know 

527.47 529.47 B: do you have kids that are in the military 

529.51 533.95 A: no i have one daughter who's thirty she's out in san francisco 

533.52 534.47 B: oh 

534.30 535.97 A: at graduate school 

535.61 537.37 B: uh-huh and in what 

536.06 537.14 A: and uh 

537.35 538.72 A: at graduate school 

538.61 540.76 B: in what graduate school and what 

540.04 545.14 A: oh uh poetry she's uh yeah she's getting a masters in fine arts 

541.38 542.51 B: oh 

545.13 546.99 B: why you're gotta be proud of her 

546.83 556.07 A: oh yeah i think uh it's something she worked for quite a while and decided and had always kinda wanted to go into graduate school so she did and that 

555.24 556.33 B: well 

556.17 557.61 A: yeah that's a good feeling 

557.68 562.93 B: yeah very good and i'm glad it's a female you know [laughter] she wouldn't have to go into the war 

558.02 558.85 A: uh 

562.87 568.72 A: yeah there you go absolutely and uh i've been thinking about you guys up there because my 

568.73 572.40 A: real real real hobby is fly fishing 

572.85 573.82 B: oh 

572.94 583.34 A: it's a thing that it's the thing that calms me down the most so in- invariably i used to travel a lot so i i was with the oil field companies as a personnel guy 

583.17 584.08 B: uh-huh 

583.92 587.35 A: who end up taking my you know and this that and uh 

587.85 589.66 A: funny how you you uh uh 

590.88 594.83 A: you just find you know little times to dip a dip a rod in or whatever 

594.59 595.70 B: yeah 

595.55 599.89 A: yeah and i think that's 'cause of the way i grew up my dad just loved the mountains he's a geologist
