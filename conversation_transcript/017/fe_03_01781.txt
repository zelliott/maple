311.58 315.38 A: yeah even some stuff that they didn't even offer at the college so 

316.11 320.82 A: [noise] in my opinion they're like the vocational school is the way to go for your son [noise] 

320.18 321.27 B: (( right ))

347.95 349.35 A: go into the other room 

350.91 352.75 A: no not at all 

352.21 353.99 B: what did it say did did 

354.03 356.55 B: talk about computers and education whether they 

356.10 357.24 A: [noise] 

356.71 357.93 B: harmful 

357.60 366.37 A: whether they harm or help education i don't see how they could well i guess you know some people could argue that they 

366.59 368.11 A: might harm 

368.28 370.48 A: education in that 

370.45 372.86 B: we don't need the books any more or something 

372.17 380.41 A: yeah and also that as far as homework and stuff that kids could cheat easy and look up the answers and 

380.10 388.12 B: i don't think so i um because they don't know what the teachers you know what i mean they don't have to go through an awful lot to know how 

385.54 386.61 A: right 

389.26 392.24 B: oh you mean like oh i never thought about that 

390.92 393.44 A: well even like math i don't know 

393.03 398.21 B: oh like call chat with someone else and get their homework answers or something 

397.23 399.19 A: like that or even 

398.91 400.46 B: mine have never done that 

399.56 401.60 A: (( kind of how like )) 

400.89 402.87 B: i think you do that on the telephone 

402.17 407.80 A: with calculator you know what i mean just kind of put stuff in like they have programmes these days that might 

405.50 406.34 B: (( you could )) 

407.04 409.49 B: you could do it anyway you know what i mean 

408.30 416.09 A: right if they could find a way so some might argue i just don't see how where the argument would come in that it was harmful 

409.92 410.80 B: (( yes )) 

415.60 424.63 B: the thing i i would feel bad about is like some people have computers at home and other kids don't and i feel bad for the ones that don't because they can't um 

421.23 422.38 A: that's true 

424.19 426.40 A: they don't have the same the ease 

425.69 427.21 B: access yeah 

426.56 427.53 A: right 

427.87 431.65 A: the same things that the other the kids that do have computers 

431.06 436.08 B: we haven't taken the teachers' jobs away or anything with computers yet so 

435.46 436.74 A: right 

436.46 440.94 B: i don't think that would happen because the teacher will still need be there to show 'em 

442.01 444.51 B: (( to go lesson by lesson you know what i mean )) 

443.86 447.42 A: right well i don't know i think even 

447.90 455.82 A: on line college courses without teachers are you know on line or whatever i just think if you need a human person to teach you 

456.43 459.78 A: so you can ask them questions and 

459.20 460.42 B: i took a 

459.89 462.50 A: have ex- explanations you know 

462.15 468.20 B: uh-huh i um needed a computer to get ready for the um the high real estate exam 

467.84 469.47 A: mhm 

469.46 477.14 B: and it helped a lot i don't know what i would have did without it if i didn't take they send you one on a disk like a practice exam 

476.76 477.77 A: uh-huh 

477.80 484.02 B: what i would it it took the stress off you it was that's basically what it was for it was like a short one and to 

484.20 488.81 B: take the stress off 'cause it's like kind of putting you in the mood to get ready for 

488.43 495.11 A: right and if you did well then you know can pretty say well i know what i'm talking about i know how you know i'm going to do all right 

494.61 496.81 B: yeah and um 

496.03 498.58 A: time to prepare you give you a practice test 

498.19 505.28 B: my second time around being a realtor so i don't know if it was the computer disk that helped or probably because i had background you know mhm 

501.37 502.48 A: [laughter] 

504.33 505.83 A: right right 

506.94 512.36 A: i don't know i i think the computer as far as writing papers and 

512.43 514.71 A: even you know like when 

515.05 521.95 A: you're writing a paper on a computer as opposed to using the typewriter it's just it saves so much time if you make a mistake 

522.26 526.88 A: and have to delete or change things around um 

526.59 532.46 B: and they're accessible for handicapped people and diff- people with hearing problems or 

532.33 533.46 A: right 

534.03 534.94 A: it's 

534.51 540.20 B: did you ever put that um calculator on the screen or your keyboard on the screen 

540.20 543.82 A: yes i've done i haven't done the keyboard but i've done 

540.75 541.66 B: did you 

543.66 546.34 B: the keyboard and you just touch the screen and 

545.71 546.82 A: uh-huh 

547.72 551.07 B: oh no it's interesting i don't do it very often but 

550.94 552.03 A: right 

552.67 554.85 A: most of the time you wouldn't need to but [noise] 

554.58 557.26 B: i wish they would make computers just a little bit more 

558.56 563.09 B: lower priced so more people could you know afford them have 

562.20 563.93 A: enjoy it right 

563.29 564.55 B: access to 'em 

564.59 565.83 A: i agree 

566.45 569.77 B: (( i'm running out of things [laughter] to )) 

568.56 571.20 A: i know i i wonder how long we've been on the phone 

571.03 573.60 B: (( think about um i don't know )) 

573.02 574.57 A: hold on i'll tell you hold on 

574.09 576.51 B: they said they would beep us or something 

575.90 578.99 A: my little timer's not working i guess it tells me how long 

577.83 581.99 B: it's just right about ten minutes right now one more minute and 

581.04 582.40 A: oh okay 

582.32 592.10 B: but i'm so happy that um computers are involved in our education i know we have to buy our send a headset in um to school at the beginning of the year and if it breaks 

592.32 594.68 B: you know but then it costs 

595.16 596.99 B: you know a couple of dollars 

596.70 599.95 A: right a headset to use the computers 

599.12 599.89 B: yeah
