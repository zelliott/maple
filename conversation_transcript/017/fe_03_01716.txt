5.25 7.24 B: uh go ahead [laughter] 

5.35 6.17 A: um 

6.99 7.97 A: [laughter] 

8.05 10.60 A: (( um so what do you think do you think )) 

9.98 17.33 B: yeah i think we do i think south korea's a a big no is it [lipsmack] north korea yeah north korea and also syria 

14.07 15.11 A: (( north korea )) 

15.74 16.52 A: yeah 

17.67 21.08 A: yeah i i would say that um 

20.09 20.65 B: (( [mn] )) 

22.18 30.93 A: [sigh] personally i think like in terms of just a nation i think north korea's probably the biggest threat to u._s. security um 

29.25 30.07 B: yes 

31.11 36.30 A: did you think that um iraq was a threat to u._s. security 

35.91 40.73 B: yes i did actually i agree i think that they um 

37.61 38.46 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

41.31 45.75 B: that eventually it had been like a hitler situation where they would have eventually 

45.89 52.51 B: killed so many people and we would have been unaware we would have think thought it but we wouldn't have had proof of it so yes i did did you 

52.68 64.94 A: um well i thought that well it's kinda like i'm kind of torn on the issue you know um but i've i've kinda felt that they were 

64.94 69.87 A: the administration in iraq was a threat to the people of iraq you know 

69.51 70.34 B: (( right [noise] )) 

69.97 74.05 A: um but the fact that a lot of the neighboring countries 

74.17 80.11 A: uh in the middle east w- were against um u._s. aggression i i don't think that 

80.19 83.72 A: they felt that iraq was a threat to them directly 

83.31 93.78 B: [noise] do you think that might have been because of well i think that a lot of the reason they didn't want to see the freedom in i- iraq though was because they have the same type of leadership such as saddam 

93.43 94.57 A: (( [noise] right )) 

93.86 101.33 B: hussein is [mn] you know just one leader and when you see one country that you're so close to relatively as far as politically 

100.95 102.68 A: mhm 

101.29 114.05 B: receive freedom and then you s- they start having riots you yourself may want to have those same rights that you you didn't know existed and for them to be able to stand up now and protest america 

109.44 111.18 A: yeah 

113.58 115.23 A: mhm 

114.41 124.64 B: and have that right to do it and we don't do anything but you know let them do that that's that's says a lot that this is a freedom they've never received now do i think they should protest us no [noise] i don't but 

118.39 119.30 A: right 

124.71 126.42 B: it's good to see that they 

126.68 131.35 B: are doing it in a peaceful manner and they're being respectful [noise] and they but they 

128.29 129.15 A: uh-huh 

131.38 138.68 B: they have a right to say you know we need or we need our water we need this and that and you know they they just don't realise how much time it takes [noise] 

139.09 142.67 A: yeah i i think you bring up a good point like i i think that [sigh] 

143.29 151.76 A: the fact that like ano- a lot of the allegations are i mean there is a definite anti american sentiment over there and um 

152.19 157.35 A: part of the reason that they're against it is just because they're against the u._s. and i agree with that um 

155.00 155.79 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

158.09 159.72 A: as far as like a direct 

159.58 162.32 A: relationship to like a threat [noise] to the united 

162.31 174.91 A: states i don't think that um iraq was a threat like i do believe that all the terrorist organizations and things like that as like an entity are but i don't know that there's one nation beside them 

174.74 180.76 A: syria i think maybe and i think north korea's definitely an actual threat as a nation towards us 

180.51 181.48 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

181.11 185.67 A: and i think that one that could become a problem is the india pakistan 

185.30 186.37 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

185.68 187.36 A: conflict because 

187.90 188.97 A: um 

189.61 190.31 A: like 

190.23 204.72 A: one of the reasons that i was kind of hesitant about the iraq war in the first place was because i felt like if we sort of just went in and didn't wait for the u- united nations to sort of finish their work quote unquote you know 

204.37 205.31 B: (( yeah )) 

204.70 205.74 A: um 

205.76 212.93 A: then it would have sort of set this precedent that a preemptive strike as like you know the administration calls it is 

212.84 215.94 A: something that like it's kind of dangerous when you think about like 

215.71 221.11 A: other nations like india and pakistan who have nuclear weapons who could just be like well 

220.92 234.53 A: that other country is a perceived threat so i'm just gonna you know bomb them and i think that if we don't proceed diplomatically in a in a situation such as that then that could become a direct problem to the united states 

223.19 224.03 B: right 

234.25 247.42 B: [noise] well i think that you know somebody has to answer the call as far as there are you know people dying and nobody willing to step in and say you know this this shouldn't be happening we should stop there was a hundred thousand kurds that were killed uh 

239.20 240.88 A: mhm 

247.36 250.11 B: or approximate you know they was talking about uh 

248.73 249.56 A: right 

250.14 254.78 B: how last time they set up [mn] hou- huts and everything they couldn't 

254.93 266.26 B: uh take all the people that was coming in there were so many and it that was what twelve years ago and now they h- have received very little and they believe the reason being was um 

258.35 259.26 A: mhm 

266.18 270.23 B: saddam gassed them all and a lot of those people died and um 

267.05 268.39 A: mhm 

270.55 273.45 B: you know if we'd a done our job right twelve years ago 

273.36 274.22 A: then 

273.43 285.91 B: it wouldn't have happened but now uh hopefully we'll get it right this time but i i do believe that syria and i believe that there's uh you know none of this is proven and it's all thought but i do believe that they're taking in um 

286.26 290.00 B: [lipsmack] the fifty five or the ones that's left i know we've captured eight 

289.61 291.30 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

290.14 297.99 B: but i do believe that syria will be more of threat because they don't mind taking in the ones that's against america and then you have all the other muslims that believe that 

297.91 310.75 B: you know that [mn] what's happening in iraq is our fault that you know that uh they really see saddam as a m- a martyr if he is dead and if he's alive they think he's a hero and so it's a it's a sad thing 

301.04 301.88 A: right 

306.85 309.46 A: (( mhm )) 

310.49 311.87 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

311.42 317.75 B: they can't see the heart behind it they really think that we're just doing it for oil and i you know some americans believe that too [noise] 

312.79 313.35 A: (( [cough] )) 

317.14 318.49 A: (( mhm )) 

318.68 325.57 A: see it i- it's such a tough situation though you know because like it's a really difficult balance i think because 

326.39 339.85 A: um like i- it it is easy to say like it's just for oil and i mean i don't think it is because if it was then we would've just done that twelve years ago and just taken the oil and taken control of it 'cause we we had it you know 

337.29 338.19 B: right 

340.18 341.32 A: um 

341.95 354.08 A: but i think like a better argument would have been like this is to prove the us' dominance in like other areas of the world like in the middle east that's w- that's like one of the only areas that holds 

348.13 349.18 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

349.35 349.92 B: (( [noise] )) 

354.17 359.90 A: on on earth that we don't really have like a pretty good strong arm over you know 

359.46 360.43 B: mhm 

360.08 360.97 A: um 

361.39 364.86 A: so i can kind of see why they would say that especially because 

365.08 366.11 A: um 

366.65 372.26 A: in countries where there is such great oppression like in iraq for the last y- how many years 

372.32 381.87 A: um a lot of times they can be sort of like uh pushed to believe certain things and like it's like in germany like everyone was 

378.43 379.38 B: right 

382.26 394.32 A: s- i mean like i hate to compare it to like hitler's germany but um there were so many people in like poverty that it's like they're willing to look to blame someone you know 

394.01 394.84 B: (( right [noise] )) 

394.42 395.94 A: and um 

396.70 398.58 A: so i mean from that standpoint i think i- 

399.07 412.39 A: it's kind of rough for us to it's difficult for us to show them you know especially when like they're shown images that aren't necessarily congruent with the truth and like 

413.18 423.78 A: that makes it kind of difficult but [sigh] i don't know my m- i kind of was against going into iraq when we did because 

421.91 422.80 B: really 

424.20 426.08 A: i mean like 

426.17 430.97 A: i think a lot of the deaths in iraq over the last twelve years were because of sanctions by the u._s. 

431.14 438.85 A: and like it's hard i don't know like what the answer is though like i think w- we did have to remove him though so that part is good that that he is out of power now 

438.58 450.84 B: yes well i think that they would never like i say i th- i think that they will never experience freedom they've been under his law uh rule for thirty years i don't and i believe that you've kept up it with it pretty well just hearing you speak 

439.07 440.02 A: um 

443.35 444.47 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

450.78 458.16 B: and then so you also realize that of the things of his son sons both of them qusay and usay and how they 

458.23 463.44 B: you know they pretty much done what they wanted to and raped whoever they wanted to and had the family 

460.20 461.57 A: mhm 

463.23 464.31 A: yeah 

463.52 471.93 B: if someone spoke against saddam they brought in not just the child but the whole family and raped the women and killed 'em and uh uh brutalized them um 

472.06 472.92 A: yeah 

472.30 483.39 B: for me there wasn't a question uh was i aware of all these things no i wasn't but i did realize that uh we had many terrorists in that area that um will rise up 

480.50 481.47 A: (( mm yes )) 

483.40 489.95 B: because of just what happened with the twin tower towers and so um and i know 

487.26 488.09 A: uh-huh 

489.91 499.32 B: i was watching the news the other day and they said i- that some people in the united states population thought that cana- canada was a threat and i don't believe that 

497.39 498.10 A: (( oh )) 

498.69 500.46 A: yeah 

499.47 501.48 B: but i do believe that um 

502.18 507.81 B: [lipsmack] over there we have many many people that would like to see the united sates states suffer 

507.42 509.12 A: right 

507.82 508.99 B: and um 

509.24 520.77 A: do you that there is a connection in the i i remember hearing like a lot of like over half of the nation thinks that there that saddam hussein was directly responsible for september eleventh like do you think that 

520.18 524.90 B: i think that he had a lot to do with that i do believe that he helped finance it um 

525.26 531.54 B: do i believe he was on in on the plan and that's a good question and you know we may never know that but i know that they've 

531.61 535.85 B: are are linking more and more things to the fact that he was um 

536.00 549.90 B: or they're trying to link other things to it and saying that yes he was very aware of the situation and you know he was all for it of course and they found six hundred million dollars today in the in the wall and you know that to me also it's like 

539.87 540.71 A: (( mhm yeah mhm )) 

548.20 549.27 A: right 

550.12 559.35 B: if we were in it for money or for oil or whatever that would have never been told i mean we would have you know took the money and said here that'll help pay us back for what we've already 

553.10 553.91 A: mhm 

559.11 559.96 A: uh-huh 

559.21 567.98 B: done for this country and yet again we're trying to give it back to the people a- and that's stating again that we have good intentions that we're not trying to 

563.04 565.13 A: mhm 

567.85 574.69 B: increase our w- worth or value we're really trying to give them that freedom that we enjoy so much 

574.19 576.96 A: yeah yeah um 

577.35 580.62 A: (( what was this thing i i was just going to say something um [mn] )) 

582.09 593.90 A: do you do you personally like as someone who i i guess like you supported supported the iraq war do you think that like if we don't actually find weapons of mass destruction do you think that that would be a problem for you like would you 

593.96 597.73 A: like w- would you would your views change at all on that 

597.21 599.83 B: no [noise] no because i think that what
