0.00 1.84 B: hi i'm holly 

1.47 3.05 A: hi this is duane 

2.79 3.91 B: hi duane 

4.18 8.03 B: so um i think the topic was something about um 

7.53 10.69 A: what other countries are a threat to the united states 

8.23 10.32 B: [laughter] yeah 

10.59 12.68 B: so what do you think 

12.62 13.55 A: um 

13.73 17.19 A: yeah i i suppose there are threats out there but i don't think they 

17.26 22.63 A: are from other countries necessarily i think they're from groups within countries 

22.54 23.62 B: oh okay 

23.10 26.11 A: uh i don't know if that gets us off the topic 

25.85 30.31 B: oh you mean like like osama bin laden's type of group like the terrorist groups 

28.00 29.48 A: right 

29.63 32.87 A: right or even groups within the country 

32.45 43.46 B: right well see like syria scares me a little [laughter] yeah but only because they harbor people like osama bin laden and you know they support groups like that [noise] 

35.95 36.69 A: (( does it )) 

38.86 39.94 A: right 

40.55 41.57 A: right 

42.68 50.89 A: yeah they're not really overtly out to get us but if if we do have issues come up uh it's very likely 

50.97 53.51 A: it'll come from there 

53.04 62.42 B: exactly and also like korea scares me a little bit too as well [laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter] because you know [cough] they just they they're 

53.99 54.94 A: so 

56.70 58.69 A: yeah north korea 

62.50 70.68 B: you know i don't know i guess it's just the weapons and you know and i just i just wish there was world peace and then we wouldn't have any of these issues [noise] 

64.95 66.19 A: right 

68.83 69.75 A: uh-huh 

70.31 81.06 A: right right [sigh] no i agree um if there is any country that's overtly out there uh kind of in our face it's north korea 

81.21 84.49 A: and it doesn't make sense to me because 

84.75 89.05 A: the i mean except for the recent events with 

89.43 100.41 A: the war in iraq the rest of the world supports the united states uh or at least has the same viewpoint about north and south korea and at least that's my perception 

92.96 94.08 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

100.27 101.18 B: right 

101.19 106.66 B: yeah i feel like everyone supports us um even though they weren't real happy about the way we went about it 

106.14 107.43 A: right 

106.89 116.65 B: um but they support us and they understand um i'm glad that i mean i feel safer now that saddam is at least his power's at least been 

116.67 117.67 A: right 

116.90 124.67 B: thrown off thrown off so i i do feel a whole lot safer 'cause i really felt uncomfortable about saddam hussein i always have 

120.91 121.90 A: yeah 

123.82 129.24 A: uh-huh yeah he's kind of a wild card there's just no predicting what he'll do 

125.97 127.83 B: [laughter] he was 

129.69 131.79 A: so that's that's frightening 

131.20 134.38 B: mhm 'cause he always reminded me of like 

132.00 133.76 A: um 

134.96 145.33 B: of uh like a h- hitler or something like that like he was just crazy out of his mind you know maybe not in the same ways but for the most part [laughter] he's like this [noise] 

137.57 138.75 A: (( [noise] right )) 

139.89 140.92 A: right 

143.77 158.19 A: no i i think it's a good analogy he's he's crazy out of his mind but he also has the power to be very destructive uh out of his mind you know there there are a lot of crazy people but most of 'em are harmless because they don't have the power 

150.64 152.12 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

156.54 157.38 B: right 

158.14 161.45 A: [noise] but he was definitely [noise] a serious threat [noise] 

161.15 170.50 B: yeah and i think i think that the whole i mean i feel a whole lot safer now i don't think that korea is just going to come after us and bomb us for no reason at all 

168.82 169.95 A: right 

170.28 171.27 A: yeah 

170.66 184.25 B: um although i think they might mess with other people in their area i don't think they would mess with us but i don't think they're just going to come over and go oh we hate you and we're going to bomb you now although i feel although i felt saddam hussein would do that 

176.18 177.34 A: right 

180.50 181.55 A: right 

183.57 184.50 A: uh-huh 

184.44 189.31 B: or at least get or at least support groups that would do it like osama bin laden 

188.35 190.06 A: (( [noise] right )) 

189.60 195.77 B: or al qaeda or whatever you call that group [laughter] you know and i don't know i just um 

191.47 192.54 A: right 

195.78 202.32 B: [noise] i i hope that they take care of osama bin laden because there are a lot of countries over in the middle east that support them 

202.02 204.05 A: right right 

203.03 215.01 B: and that that you're right that that that bothers me more than just the specific country you know because apparently he did nine eleven and you know i don't think that he'd go after new york city again 

207.81 208.71 A: uh-huh 

215.09 216.00 A: no 

215.25 220.83 B: i think that he'd go after somewhere else in the united states like california or something 

220.50 223.78 A: right it was kind of interesting to me he 

220.85 221.58 B: (( [cough] )) 

224.25 229.85 A: the targets that he chose i think were more symbolic than effective 

230.03 233.69 A: uh you know if if he had taken out say hoover dam 

233.80 244.84 A: that would have not only flooded millions of homes but it also would have wiped out power to millions of other homes or you know just i i thought there were a lot of other targets that 

241.14 242.02 B: right 

244.75 254.12 A: just as easily could have been hit and have a greater impact so it's fortunate i mean it it's sad all the lives that we lost and uh 

246.56 248.38 B: mhm 

254.55 261.32 A: all of the issues that it caused but in a way it's it's much better than it could have been 

257.20 258.23 B: yeah 

261.14 262.02 B: right 

262.10 264.46 A: so hopefully oh go ahead 

262.18 263.04 B: i mean 

263.90 267.69 B: oh sorry i i was just going to say that you know i think [sigh] 

267.54 280.08 B: that he mainly hit the world trade centers because it a lot of people take a lot of pride in new york city even though it is a dirty city [laughter] for the most part there are a lot of things there to be proud of like the statue and 

272.84 273.94 A: right 

275.23 276.12 A: uh-huh 

279.74 280.75 A: right 

279.98 288.51 B: you know the world trade center it kind of stands for america and so does washington d._c. so i think it was more of a hit on our pride 

282.85 283.83 A: uh-huh 

288.04 295.99 A: right [noise] yeah i think for most foreigners when they think of the united states they think of either the capital or they think of new york 

296.29 302.81 A: uh and for a lot of americans that's where their families first came through was in new york 

302.28 303.19 B: right 

302.82 305.64 A: so no i agree with it's a very 

306.42 312.70 A: very emotional target and and i think maybe that's what he wanted but 

308.72 309.93 B: yeah definitely 

311.29 312.12 B: (( yeah i )) 

312.13 313.48 B: (( i think so )) 

313.51 315.26 B: go ahead i'm sorry [laughter] 

313.84 314.77 A: yeah 

315.88 322.17 B: uh yeah i think he just um you know he's he's definitely a crazy person and just you know and 

320.74 321.90 A: right 

322.40 330.17 B: of course i have an issue with anyone that um that insists that they're always right and i feel like that's how he feels 

328.27 329.23 A: yeah 

329.73 331.53 A: yeah 

330.80 332.05 B: and 

332.07 340.67 B: so i i just i just hope that they're able to um stop all his funds because i do truly believe that saddam hussein was funding him 

340.60 341.50 A: okay 

341.43 342.76 B: [laughter] 

341.80 343.72 A: yeah no that makes sense and it's 

343.83 349.38 A: uh one of my friends was commenting that it's strange we haven't had any terrorist attacks since then 

349.54 360.63 A: uh but i think that's the reason why is that the funding has been ceased and you know the the terrorist cells still exist but they don't have 

360.97 371.23 A: the direction uh from their superiors and they also don't have the funding available to go ahead and implement their plans so 

369.36 370.44 B: right 

371.27 373.33 A: it's go ahead 

371.28 372.13 B: but c- 

372.38 380.01 B: e- even though o- osama bin laden had a huge inheritance i still think that most of his funds because he had to have millions 

379.72 380.66 A: yeah 

380.04 380.97 B: um 

381.31 386.38 B: come from came from definitely came from saddam and afghanistan the taliban 

386.14 387.28 A: right 

386.59 390.90 B: no doubt in my mind you know and saddam hussein has a lot of money 

388.36 389.47 A: yeah 

391.23 395.87 B: a lot of money [laughter] probably too much for his own good 

392.54 393.48 A: yeah 

395.42 396.34 A: uh-huh 

396.02 405.77 B: and uh yeah he definitely was giving money to them and i'm glad that president bush did something about it because i think i think he knew that as well he just had no proof 

401.67 402.64 A: right 

405.56 406.85 A: yeah 

406.92 408.09 B: (( yeah so [laughter] the war plays [noise] )) 

407.52 410.78 A: yeah it'll be interesting as [noise] 

410.84 418.26 A: out a little further i guess the war itself is mostly over but as iraq is uh 

418.45 421.98 A: brought back to stability i i think a lot of 

422.24 432.16 A: uh treasure troves will be turned up uh hidden accounts and secret deals with foreign governments exporting oil under the table 

432.08 439.64 A: or various things that will show how involved they actually were with supporting terrorism 

439.86 446.43 A: and and i don't know that the biological weapons will ever turn up i think they've already been shipped to syria or 

446.56 456.17 A: somewhere else that we won't find them but i think there will still be a lot of records [noise] uh indicating that there was a significant threat 

456.20 469.53 A: uh bt of course people people who think that they weren't there to begin with will just say well these are documents the u._s. government has made up or this is something that the united states keeps in store just so that they can pin 

457.02 457.79 B: well 

470.05 473.94 A: uh things on other people and it's 

474.79 476.63 A: it's kind of an irrational 

476.82 485.21 A: topic with a lot of people you can't discuss it openly because they're not willing to admit that it's not a conspiracy from the united states 

486.22 491.02 B: [laughter] right yeah i definitely think that um a lot of people um 

491.52 496.21 B: [sigh] that you know especially in the middle east they think that uh 

496.61 504.28 B: we're out to get them because they're muslims or whatever or it's because of their religious beliefs when really that's what america is based on 

499.90 501.07 A: right 

503.93 504.96 A: right 

504.35 512.80 B: having freedom of religious beliefs and w- we could really [laughter] we don't really care if you're muslim or if you're a catholic or a christian or 

510.15 511.25 A: right 

512.69 527.22 B: or whatever um it doesn't really make a difference to us it's more of um you know if you respect the laws and y- you know you do the right thing it's and i feel that i feel that our government pretty much um 

522.68 524.25 A: (( right [cough] )) 

527.18 536.80 B: stands by that you know i mean i'm not saying everyone on there is a perfect person i'm sure they're not [laughter] you know and president clinton certainly proved that 

528.41 529.43 A: yeah 

533.26 537.19 A: no i agree but i think everybody is at least trying 

537.52 540.09 B: yeah and so i think [noise] i think um 

540.66 542.50 B: i don't know i think i think that 

542.60 551.39 B: you know the whole iraq thing and i i'm pretty sure you're right [noise] that they probably have shipped out all their chemical weapons and biological weapons or whatever they had 

548.92 550.08 A: right 

551.81 557.31 B: they probably got rid of them but they're smarter than that [noise] i keep saying that to people i go you know these people aren't stupid 

556.80 558.16 A: right 

557.56 561.55 B: i mean come on look what they did with nine eleven they're not dumb 

561.37 562.29 A: uh-huh 

561.85 570.85 B: they are intelligent human beings even though the- you know a lot of people say oh they're idiots and stuff and i don't think so i think they're really intelligent 

564.02 565.19 A: right 

570.27 571.51 A: right 

570.97 572.09 B: and 

572.25 575.16 B: [laughter] that you never underestimate them 

574.95 577.51 A: yeah yeah 

576.03 583.41 B: and y- you know even though they do suicide bombings and in our in most americans' opinions that's just stupid 

582.86 584.05 A: right 

584.10 585.77 B: um but 

585.15 585.88 A: but 

586.30 587.24 A: you go ahead 

586.42 597.15 B: [laughter] that shows their intelligence you know and that i mean in their religious beliefs they die you know uh doing a suicide bombing and that's that's the most prideful way to die 

588.70 589.83 A: right 

596.82 598.62 A: right 

597.68 598.45 B: so 

598.90 599.95 B: (( you know [laughter] )) 

599.08 599.89 A: yeah
