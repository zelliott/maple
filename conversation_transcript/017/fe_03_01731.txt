10.49 11.49 B: well 

11.61 14.69 B: i that that question's kinda tricky 

14.37 15.82 A: [laughter] 

15.15 20.36 B: well it is and it isn't do we think any other country i think there are probably 

17.29 18.59 A: yeah 

20.69 25.72 B: several countries that could be a threat to the united states but i don't know that much about 

25.90 29.59 B: politics to be able to explain exactly why 

29.77 31.64 A: yeah um 

32.22 45.86 A: i i listen to the radio a lot i don't have a t._v. so i don't i don't watch the news or anything but um you know i listen to like rushland barr and um michael savage and you know a few of the other 

45.57 48.00 B: shaun hanidy by any chance 

47.87 50.32 A: um no i've never heard of him 

50.18 55.00 B: oh okay he's really good we just started get him here in cincinnati 

54.83 55.67 A: uh-huh 

55.26 61.59 B: he's also on fox t._v. the sh- hanidy and cone show 

60.09 60.93 A: okay 

61.55 62.52 A: okay 

62.11 63.16 B: yeah 

63.94 68.02 A: yeah i i guess right now the biggest um 

68.26 71.21 A: threats that i feel is um 

71.22 77.65 A: well possibly syria um but they seem to be coming around and um 

77.72 81.93 A: iran and saudi arabia and uh 

82.01 85.12 A: north korea that's uh that's iffy 

85.28 96.03 B: tha- i feel the same way you do i think those other countries in the middle east i don't know whether they are an immediate threat right now but we need to keep an eye on them 

95.99 102.18 B: and we we don't we need to not get too complacent with what just happened in iraq 

96.01 97.01 A: yeah 

102.25 103.29 A: yeah 

102.33 107.74 B: uh you know and we need to keep our eyes and ears open but and i'm sure the government is 

105.69 106.58 A: well 

107.74 111.06 A: oh yeah and see one thing that um 

111.50 116.32 A: one of the reasons why i was for the war with iraq was because 

116.52 117.53 A: um 

117.58 121.30 A: we are fighting a war against terror- terrorism 

121.51 122.35 B: right 

121.64 122.87 A: and 

123.22 134.13 A: it doesn't matter where it doesn't matter whose terrorists uh we're didn't specify president bush didn't specify okay we are only to give those that are terrorizing us no he said 

134.82 139.05 A: against terror- terrorism globally and 

139.20 143.12 A: so that could be anybody's terrorists you know um 

143.30 144.91 A: which i think 

145.30 149.93 A: he was very wise in the way he did that um because 

150.80 161.54 A: you know that that gives us the open door to be able to go in and if we find a bunch of terrorists to be able go take care of that instead of 

161.49 166.11 A: you know trying to find reasons and that's why i feel that the u._n. had no 

166.21 168.00 A: business stopping us 

168.07 172.67 A: from iraq because there is there were terrorists in 

172.72 174.43 A: iraq so 

174.27 183.32 B: right and i don't think we really needed the u._n.'s permission to do it obviously because we did it but the united states was just trying to you know 

178.18 178.99 A: no 

183.38 190.02 B: let the rest of the world know this is what we're going to do are you behind us and most of the world was behind us 

187.43 188.34 A: (( yes )) 

189.62 192.11 A: exactly exactly 

190.72 195.23 B: the the the few countries who weren't just got a lot press 

195.55 204.38 B: for for being against it and yeah i agree with you we're it it it wasn't a war with iraq they didn't even call it that 

197.64 198.66 A: yeah 

204.37 212.28 B: it is a war on terrorism and to try to we have to stop it all over the world we have to stop it to it's been going on for too long 

208.27 209.14 A: yeah 

210.54 211.31 A: (( yes )) 

213.08 225.13 A: yeah and that's why i think that if we end up going to war against syria i'm all for it you know or saudi arabia or iran or or even north korea you know i mean 

225.45 231.94 A: yeah we you know we need to be careful you know at first like with civilians but at the same time 

232.31 236.37 A: you know if we're getting rid of the terrorists and if we 

236.78 239.77 A: are if we are freeing these countries 

239.90 244.53 A: to where the people have more control this is going to be less terrorism 

244.46 251.80 B: well and i i think what we just did in iraq i'm glad we did because i believe it sent a message 

251.90 253.03 A: mhm 

252.03 253.68 B: to the rest of the world 

253.55 254.62 A: oh yeah 

253.98 259.13 B: we're not going to take it anymore it almost reminds me of bullying in school 

259.09 260.18 A: yeah 

259.58 263.06 B: we stood up and said you're not going to do that anymore 

262.99 263.94 A: yeah 

263.78 265.34 B: and we hit back 

265.46 266.31 A: yeah 

266.43 269.81 A: and i'm so proud of my country [laughter] 

269.22 276.24 B: oh i am too and i think it is terrific and it's hard i have family members who feel the opposite 

276.11 277.65 A: mhm i do too 

276.72 283.38 B: and and and it's real hard it's really hard to talk to them it's hard to get them to realize 

283.59 290.01 B: you know that a lot of things don't you understand the things that you're hearing someone created 

283.91 284.87 A: yeah 

289.93 291.02 A: mhm 

290.41 292.07 B: to get you to think this 

292.23 295.18 B: way what you're hearing is not based on fact 

292.44 293.22 A: (( yeah )) 

295.26 298.37 B: you know we're going over there for oil 

295.46 296.45 A: well 

298.59 300.85 B: it's a war about oil 

298.64 300.01 A: exactly 

300.95 308.77 A: but you know what it's funny because if this had been a democrat that had been leading this 

309.39 311.64 A: everybody would have been for it 

311.65 312.74 B: oh right 

311.86 312.81 A: (( you know )) 

312.90 317.48 A: and it's sad that people have to let 

318.29 323.04 A: the politics like that interfere with doing the right thing 

322.93 330.10 B: right i believe that a lot of the people that took a stand against the war for purely political motive 

329.86 330.78 A: yeah 

330.14 342.07 B: they want they really really wanted the war to turn they wanted our country to lose the war so they could use that as a political tool to have their guy elected in the next election 

342.11 343.05 A: yeah 

342.51 355.37 B: and it is really sad and it is especially sad for the young men and women and their families the young men and women who are over there the young men and women who are in north korea oh south korea right now 

344.13 345.02 A: yeah 

355.74 356.85 A: yeah 

355.77 360.09 B: my my nephew is over there he's been over there for about a year 

358.09 358.94 A: uh-huh 

360.43 364.89 B: and um you know so that our country is keeping an eye on them 

365.23 369.29 B: but yeah there are a lot of threats out there and we don't know 

369.85 373.37 B: obviously we weren't expecting september the eleventh 

373.57 374.43 A: no 

374.76 385.70 A: the you know we don't know if it could happen again i mean obviously it can happen again but we don't when or where and [mn] you know 

386.01 388.18 A: [mn] if people are going to just 

389.02 392.05 A: be pacifist and just ignore 

392.39 394.35 A: you know or or they're out 

394.74 397.98 A: for their own gain it's gonna happen again 

397.68 402.58 B: right well you said pacifist the one thing that drives me crazy 

398.45 399.50 A: you know 

402.53 413.43 B: is i i also listen to the talk radio shows and people will call in and say i'm a pacifist or i'm a peace monger the lack of a war does not equal peace 

413.40 415.79 A: that's right that's right 

414.50 425.29 B: we didn't have peace how can you have peace if you think of what the word peace means how can you have peace when there is the threat of terrorism in front of you 

425.34 426.37 A: that's right 

426.69 429.04 B: and and so it drives me crazy 

428.86 429.82 A: yeah 

429.06 430.76 B: to hear them say that 

431.64 432.86 B: but uh 

432.02 433.03 A: yeah 

432.94 439.63 B: i don't know i think you know we will have a military presence over in that part of the world for quite a while 

439.92 441.00 A: yeah 

440.50 444.20 B: and um you know i think some some of those 

444.31 454.41 B: uh liberal folk think that now that the war is over they should all come back now and everything you know go back to the way it was everything can't go back to the way it was 

454.29 456.66 A: nine eleven changed the world 

456.23 457.03 B: no 

456.73 458.90 A: it not only changed 

457.90 459.28 B: yeah you're right 

459.04 467.01 A: the united states but it changed the world it changed the outlook of every person in the world and 

467.22 477.27 A: [mn] you know because not only did it affect our economy it affected the economy in many many many different countries 

477.46 478.44 A: so 

477.49 478.43 B: well 

478.19 487.45 B: and a lot of my friends who were against the war were against it for economic reasons they didn't think past their pocketbook and they 

484.20 485.30 A: [laughter] 

487.22 497.43 B: they talked so much about how much the war was going to cost and they didn't want their money being spent on that they wanted their money being spent on something else that would 

497.64 500.45 B: immediately affect them 

500.47 505.37 B: and they didn't see that fighting terrorism had anything to do with them 

500.77 501.65 A: yeah 

505.38 506.20 A: (( yeah )) 

506.67 508.55 A: see and that's sad because 

508.67 509.82 A: (( now )) 

510.25 519.22 A: you know the people in the other countries that are being suppressed and and y- y- being dictated over 

519.23 523.73 A: you know they they see what's going on here they see the division 

523.89 524.74 A: but 

525.44 533.64 A: y- y- they're hoping that some day we'll be able to go in and liberate them like we did iraq 

533.01 533.83 B: right 

534.01 541.08 A: but when they see people like like the democrats and the people that are against it 

534.53 535.91 B: i think so too 

541.49 550.18 A: you know they they're going to start saying well hey you know what if their voice actually starts being heard you know especially when it 

550.27 553.15 A: gets closer to re-election you know 

553.29 554.34 B: right 

553.58 556.43 A: people are going to be really worried 

556.06 568.89 B: but maybe some of the people in the middle east will see that maybe the people from iraq are seeing that there are people in our country who strongly protested the war and nobody shot them 

569.38 570.44 A: yeah 

569.82 583.95 B: [lipsmack] so maybe we've got the right idea maybe our democratic society and our freedom is a good idea because those people do have the freedom to be very vocal and object to the war and and nobody shot them or 

572.31 573.74 A: exactly 

576.61 577.35 A: yeah 

583.75 586.61 B: or kidnapped and tortured their children 

586.69 587.70 A: yeah 

587.27 592.18 B: [laughter] and they might be seeing that there is there might a future for them 

592.61 594.99 A: oh i hope so i hope 

593.65 594.96 B: i do too 

595.10 599.89 A: i hope these people will just rise up and take control do the right
