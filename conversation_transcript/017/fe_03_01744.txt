28.12 33.53 B: oh hm i was thinking about it i don't know do you have any off the top of your head 

33.82 36.35 A: um i think north korea 

37.33 42.34 A: because of them producing the um nuclear weapons or the nuclear warheads 

42.16 44.13 B: oh right

45.36 47.97 A: as far as any other countries right now i really 

48.15 53.71 B: yeah it's been mainly iraq and afghanistan and 

48.18 49.22 A: (( don't know of many )) 

53.75 56.89 B: the middle east basically and north korea 

57.17 60.61 B: although they haven't really played up north korea very much

77.97 79.32 B: hm you know 

79.91 87.01 B: they didn't really pursue it it didn't seem it just didn't get as much visibility as obviously the middle east has 

87.66 93.75 A: see and i think it should have gotten more visibility than that so [laughter] i think that that's more of a threat than 

91.02 92.35 B: well yeah 

94.16 96.15 B: they have less to lose you know 

94.61 95.75 A: iraq was
