276.08 283.70 A: because it's not as complicated as what you think and the mother boards aren't as fragile as what people say 

279.46 280.56 B: oh okay

303.14 305.07 A: okay hang on just 

307.81 316.76 A: a minute i'm going to get a pen and a piece of paper we're probably not supposed to do this [laughter] 

313.65 315.82 B: [laughter] well they didn't tell us not to 

316.84 319.73 B: perhaps on the second call we'll know 

318.31 320.65 A: [laughter] 

319.91 324.04 B: we'll know better but this is the call to make all your trial and error [laughter] 

322.37 324.95 A: [laughter] 

324.09 326.07 B: and it is educational 

325.50 327.68 A: yeah what's your address 

327.50 328.86 B: t. i. p. 

328.68 330.19 A: t. i. p. 

329.63 331.09 B: the number four 

330.97 332.10 A: okay 

331.54 334.41 B: the letter u. at l. l. dotcom 

336.02 337.57 A: (( a._o._l. dotcom )) 

337.43 338.62 B: (( so if you [noise] )) 

337.59 343.34 A: mine is mail m. a. i. l. at west virginia spelt out 

343.39 345.00 A: dot net 

345.46 347.71 B: m. a. i. l. 

347.84 349.32 B: at west virginia 

348.88 350.67 A: [noise] yeah spelled out 

351.28 353.18 A: dot net 

352.89 353.87 B: okay 

354.51 361.79 A: and um it's really easy i've done a lot of repair work on friends' computers and stuff of course and i always do it for free 

362.18 363.07 A: um 

363.80 366.46 A: but i- it was always kind of a challenge 

366.83 368.62 A: to see if i could get it 

369.21 375.04 A: working or you know and have you ever done anything like add memory or anything 

374.89 388.42 B: no i've seen people do it and i have some memory laying around that i would like to put in but i guess i'm just at that panic stage which i really do need to get out of it because when i first learned computers 

388.85 398.98 B: i was learning fortran and that put a mental block in my brain but then i came out of it and just taught myself how to operate the computer period 

397.97 401.60 A: [noise] yeah well you need to not be scared 

401.64 404.60 A: because that's the thing that will hold you back 

404.93 406.83 B: yeah it's holding too okay 

406.30 416.67 A: [laughter] yeah but just but just try it i had a old computer that i tore completely apart and put it all back together and i've added and removed and 

416.65 428.84 A: um in fact when i bought this new h._p. as soon as i bought it it didn't have enough ram in it so i bought extra ram and stuck it in that's the easiest thing to do [noise] and even adding the hard drive is easy 

428.88 431.59 B: well i have a couple of hard drives around here 

432.01 434.37 A: [noise] so you're just waiting to do this 

433.66 435.42 B: yes i'm just waiting 

435.01 439.49 A: [laughter] so you need to get over the fear and just try it 

441.15 444.22 A: is your computer that you want to tear apart old 

444.28 446.13 B: (( yeah it's a three eight six )) 

446.14 447.95 A: so that's real old you 

447.63 448.73 B: yes 

448.62 450.47 A: see i wouldn't be afraid o- 

450.51 453.64 A: afraid of it do you have a restore disc 

454.05 454.98 B: no 

455.97 461.02 A: maybe you should try to get a hold of the company and get a restore disc and then if you er 

461.32 465.33 A: accidentally wipe it all out you can be able to put it right back on 

464.30 471.86 B: [mn] well i don't i'm not afraid of wiping it all out because it's on a separate drive i have three hard drives in this computer 

472.12 477.72 B: on a three eighty six that someone else put in but i want to learn how to 

473.26 474.51 A: oh 

478.00 480.19 B: go back in and and um 

480.83 483.14 B: take it out because i think it's educational 

482.82 492.00 A: oh it is it is and it's also easy you'll be surprised at how easy it is it's just kind of plugging things in and unplugging them and 

489.71 490.65 B: yes 

491.77 500.02 A: i mean you'll be amazed at how easy it is because i never thought i'd i mean like i said when i bought ours i couldn't even turn it on 

500.03 505.64 A: and then i just started messing with them and i just do all kinds of stuff 

505.04 508.07 B: so do your children also know how to um 

508.63 510.26 B: work on the computer 

510.05 513.38 A: my son that's fourteen i'm trying to teach him 

514.14 515.12 B: okay 

514.80 529.03 A: we were tearing into his computer a couple of months ago and it's still er ah tore apart and we haven't finished putting it all back together because i was putting a new modem in it and some more ram and you know doing that kind of stuff 

528.66 532.31 B: maybe i just should take it apart and look at it first 

531.72 534.37 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

533.00 536.28 B: and then try to put each piece back in 

536.36 545.19 A: yeah if you could go on the internet and get a map of like the mother board and what everything is that would really help 

537.12 538.93 B: and see what happens with it 

545.19 547.20 B: (( oh i never thought of that )) 

546.71 550.44 A: you could probably go on the web site and put in your computer 

550.10 551.15 B: yes 

550.79 556.72 A: model and ah print out like a map of everything on the mother board 

556.30 558.38 B: i did that before 

558.92 561.68 B: a long time ago i printed that out 

562.28 564.88 B: ah i think it was like specs or something 

564.42 565.56 A: yeah 

565.28 569.44 B: and i said doy yoy yoy yoy yoy [laughter] yeah 

568.33 572.37 A: yeah i didn't know what any of it meant either for a long time 

572.58 573.86 A: and um 

574.43 580.60 A: it's really easy i mean you'll be surprised once you once you go to do it the only problem is is um 

580.88 583.55 A: you know now with windows x._p. a 

583.89 591.30 A: lot of the older stuff like the c._d. roms and modems and stuff doesn't work real well if you put x._p. on there 

590.64 596.42 B: ri- well one computer i have came equipped with x._p. the other one is m._e. the 

596.44 599.89 B: other one is ninety five and my old computer is three poi-
