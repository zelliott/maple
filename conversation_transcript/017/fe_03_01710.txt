0.31 2.21 B: hello i'm margaret 

1.73 3.53 A: hi i'm krystal 

3.62 7.60 B: and ah would you like to go first about foreign relations 

8.51 10.92 A: well i don't know this is kinda off my 

10.93 14.41 A: i don't know if i should of got participated in this or not 

11.48 12.41 B: okay 

14.95 18.55 A: do i feel other countries are a threat to us is that the question 

15.12 16.16 B: well 

18.03 19.14 B: yes 

19.44 25.42 B: um for example i could start by saying yes i think that ah certain countries 

25.53 40.05 B: are always a threat to us ah it would probably vary you know during different regimes and so forth but i would expect that for example right now north korea is a significant threat to us in the fact 

40.26 45.33 B: that they could build um they do have ah nuclear 

46.14 55.64 B: ah weapons but they could um very well form a coalition with some other countries and impede the ability for us to um 

55.89 59.78 B: control the level to which they develop those weapons 

59.67 60.76 A: mhm 

60.73 62.15 B: something like that 

62.02 65.46 A: i feel there's countries in the middle east that are still a threat too 

65.45 67.34 B: absolutely 

65.55 68.20 A: i mean al qaeda just didn't disappear 

68.24 70.46 B: that's right i think um 

70.73 78.12 B: i don't think we'll be safe for sev- maybe several generations on on the subject of terrorism because 

78.17 80.97 B: terrorists are pretty much um 

81.27 86.00 B: my self definition they're lawless and so any hopes of reaching 

86.68 91.77 B: any kind of agreement on behavior are pretty well ah out of the question 

91.64 98.84 A: yeah but there are countries that that they are you know terrorists are operating in i'm sure 

99.01 108.44 B: they are operating probably in cells all across the world and the question is ah can we we're gonna have to be forced to 

99.07 99.93 A: you know 

108.47 121.91 B: stay on the defensive and stay maintain surveillance and tie up a lot of our resources to intercept potential plans i can't imagine that that would be um 

122.19 127.29 B: over with for you know the foreseeable future of my lifetime anyway 

124.36 125.34 A: (( many )) 

126.93 129.09 A: yes i guess i agree with that 

129.90 137.85 B: if ah if for example their main con- their main ah hostility is directed toward capitalism 

129.92 130.82 A: um 

138.05 141.09 B: christian countries that practice capitalism 

141.19 143.41 B: i don't ah think 

143.69 146.27 B: that they will be out of business for 

146.58 147.93 B: generations 

147.64 149.34 A: (( no no )) 

148.62 152.32 B: unless they can ah i don't i don't see the two 

152.36 154.07 B: points of view as ever 

154.16 156.18 B: reaching compromise 

156.52 157.74 A: mhm 

158.98 163.74 B: so i think to i guess to the extent that if anyone looks at um 

164.90 168.60 B: the history of the world i don't see that there have been 

168.99 176.21 B: times of peace for any significant amount of time and perhaps the most serious problem now 

176.24 181.05 B: is that we're so interwebbed globally we have ah so much 

181.11 183.53 B: global travel that 

184.06 193.72 B: one pocket is of problem is really everybody's problem and each culture will kind of get in the face of every other culture sooner or later 

193.97 195.28 A: mhm 

195.66 200.67 B: and i um in terms of foreign relations i think 

201.21 207.51 B: i guess i could predict or foresee eventually way down in the future some some day 

208.25 221.55 B: that we will all be so interwebbed economically that the the people would eventually be forced to find ah and also as far as the ecology and so forth the environment that people will 

221.69 225.27 B: be much more forced to ah work together 

225.96 226.90 B: um 

227.09 235.08 B: at the moment i'm teaching e._s._l. which so that i [noise] have students from all the all all around the globe in my classrooms and 

234.49 235.51 A: mhm 

235.18 246.92 B: clearly some of them are here as refugees and seeking refuge from warfare in their own countries and then others are here just to benefit from the american dream 

246.92 250.73 B: maybe take back the education to their own countries 

250.88 252.57 B: and um 

253.14 254.50 B: so forth and so on 

254.51 257.24 B: so i as as more and more 

257.97 269.80 B: ah people per- i guess it pertains the most to the issue about terrorism as more and more people from countries for example in the middle east that have um 

270.07 272.44 B: hostility to american 

272.61 276.20 B: ideas and and religion as they as they gain 

275.20 281.07 A: i was gonna say it's the religion thing you know the the holy war idea is what scares me you know 

280.79 283.68 B: of course it scares yeah you're right of course 

283.02 284.87 A: that [sigh] 

285.12 287.06 A: they're doing this and you know 

287.18 289.98 A: that they honestly believe that 

290.98 292.95 A: this is what has to happen 

293.39 303.02 B: i think also the fact is that they don't think this is the last life and therefore they are glad to be some of them are willing quite willing to be martyrs to 

303.07 306.37 B: attain a better status in the next world so that 

306.39 310.16 B: any time that human life is relatively expendable 

310.34 313.44 B: we lose our leverage 'cause we don't feel that way 

313.17 314.38 A: yeah 

314.80 315.63 A: yeah 

315.40 318.75 B: so that's a value clash and um 

319.59 327.45 B: i don't know there are other countries about which we know very little for example libya and some other that are just so 

327.51 334.72 B: totally enclosed that are so involved only in their own processes and are so repressed that 

332.75 335.90 A: well those countries are just so poor i don't 

335.94 336.99 A: aren't they 

336.94 344.39 B: the people are poor there there's usually ah somebody who has a lot of power and a lot of oil or some such thing 

344.23 345.16 A: (( oh )) 

345.23 355.65 B: going on and wants to hold on to that so yes libya i don't for example i just don't ever have libyan students they don't get out 

355.86 365.33 B: of their country the ah a lot of the african countries have what's called a um cultural diversity lottery 

356.89 358.21 A: mhm 

365.33 374.58 B: so many people want to come to western countries to study u._s. is one of them but many go to europe for example and um 

374.63 383.27 B: so there's a drawing and if you win the diversity or cultural lottery then you are get to come and often to bring your family 

383.32 385.87 B: ah to study here as long as 

386.68 393.69 B: people in those countries are actively involved with the united states i think even though there is terrorism 

393.76 397.49 B: in them for example ethiopia kenya um 

398.37 406.16 B: [lipsmack] sudan so forth and so on i think we have a much better chance of ah reaching some kind of um 

407.03 409.06 B: live and let live situation 

409.28 410.51 A: mhm 

409.86 420.51 B: the ones so the ones in other words the ones that really scare me are the ones where we have not much interface at all and you know syria might be one of those and um now 

415.91 416.72 A: yeah 

420.51 427.58 B: iraq was certainly one ah as we saw with afghanistan afghanistan is now much more open 

427.64 435.88 B: to the world and hopefully iraq will become and iran has got a very repressive current 

436.21 437.40 B: (( ah )) 

437.62 445.05 B: leadership and many of many of my students are escaping iran especially students of the baha'i faith 

445.28 449.67 B: because they're not allowed to go to the regular universities anymore 

449.74 455.08 B: so if they want a reasonable ah professional life they have to start looking 

455.33 457.48 B: at ways to get out of the country 

457.93 458.59 A: mm 

459.08 472.67 B: so i guess and then of course we've also had some of the croatian and um bosnian refugees too and we hear pretty horrible things about religious persecution there and 

472.77 482.05 B: we the united states has been of only you know only is so effective and then no more so in getting some of that resolved as well as the united nations so 

482.12 484.90 B: but it has become our business 

485.20 486.66 B: we we try 

485.44 486.40 A: mhm 

487.06 492.47 B: to get in and stop a lot of this ethnic cruelty where we know about it and where we can 

492.54 494.92 B: through the united nations i suppose 

495.20 496.01 A: yeah 

496.71 503.35 B: so i see the united nation the united nations is ideally in my opinion the way to make things work i'm 

503.94 506.80 B: not entirely in agreement 

505.30 508.52 A: so why would they okay in this 

508.76 512.25 A: why weren't they backing us in this conflict 

511.80 517.24 B: well i guess because some of the their constituent countries did not believe in it 

517.92 527.31 B: the united states has one opinion but we're one of many many many opinions and many were were much more willing to see 

522.02 523.47 A: yeah 

527.46 533.29 B: the process work through the united nations and continue to put pressure for more inspections 

534.47 548.20 B: and you know i'm not about i'm not able to say right or wrong but it's turning out to be very difficult to say that there were mass weapons of mass destruction because our troops have not been able to find them 

548.99 553.90 B: so you know in other words the united states took it upon itself to settle this thing 

553.79 554.66 A: yeah 

554.30 556.72 B: once and for all and there are those 

555.90 565.09 A: but they have found now the just just found some scientist showed them where a place where they could make chemical weapons 

564.87 567.35 B: right but they did not find any 

565.76 566.54 A: (( you know )) 

568.08 581.02 B: in other words we have not found huge stockpiles it's possible that the regime destroyed what they had but they have not found in any i'm just reading on m._s._n._b._c. news today 

568.33 569.45 A: (( no mm )) 

581.15 586.65 B: that you know the our intelligence had named five particular sites 

586.79 593.26 B: or five there were some very specific sites and none of them yielded anything so far 

593.57 597.07 B: so it's becoming a new international issue 

597.89 599.89 B: that ah what were we going
