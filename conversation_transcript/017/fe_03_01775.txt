20.35 21.30 A: uh-huh 

20.49 22.95 B: like those i don't think they're a threat but i think

26.13 26.97 A: (( so )) 

26.56 29.28 B: you know like the ones that didn't want to go for the war 

29.45 31.05 B: when they were talking bad about us 

31.22 33.32 A: you mean you mean like france 

33.46 34.65 B: and germany 

35.51 36.15 A: (( re- ))

39.56 43.55 B: i heard i just heard 'cause we're boycotting their stuff now that's what they said on 

43.44 47.65 A: yeah i've heard i've heard that we're we're thinking of 

47.87 50.51 A: punishing france in some way 

49.40 56.92 B: yeah like they said it's they said oh no i forget where i heard it but they were told not to boycott all those big brands that they have out there like adidas and stuff 

56.65 57.71 A: right 

57.15 62.10 B: i mean i don't think they're a threat i just they're just they're just like not our allies or anything 

61.84 66.77 A: right yeah i don't think they're a threat either um 

66.60 68.13 B: i still think that 

66.83 68.13 A: well i can 

68.16 68.98 A: (( mm )) 

68.52 74.28 B: i still think like afghanistan and all that is still kind of i know we bombed them and everything but we never got that guy 

74.71 78.12 A: (( no os- osama bin laden )) 

77.11 78.76 B: yeah we never got him 

78.56 80.13 A: no that's true 

79.67 83.21 B: and we don't have saddam either we don't have like proof that we got him 

83.13 91.88 A: right i wor- i worry more about north korea 'cause they seem to have the actual capabilities to 

84.04 85.43 B: (( that's like two of them )) 

92.33 95.43 A: you know send a nuclear bomb over here 

95.04 96.07 B: (( really )) 

96.19 99.32 A: yeah that's i mean i don't know but i- 

98.22 102.37 B: i haven't been watching it too much any more like the news about the stuff that's been going on 

102.40 103.93 A: right 

102.75 107.23 B: at at first i was watching it like every day a couple of times and now i'm like forget it 

107.10 108.16 A: yeah 

107.39 109.85 B: it's just getting like too much all the time 

109.94 117.16 A: right i hear you no i think that's wise [laughter] it can it can get ah depressing 

116.78 121.72 B: it is it was it was just like i mean i watched it just to you know at first when we were finding out but then 

121.75 125.37 B: once you basically realize that the country wasn't even a threat any more 

125.41 126.40 A: right 

125.75 128.22 B: you know they were just surrendering as soon as we found them 

128.15 135.96 A: right yeah i don't i don't know that any of these countries really ha- i mean the country itself has the capabilities to 

136.05 140.84 A: really threaten us i think individuals can do us a lot of harm but 

140.31 141.52 B: yeah 

140.68 151.06 A: but i think north korea is a possib- possible threat and it does concern me because they're actually not that far away from us either 

145.50 146.47 B: really 

153.86 154.77 A: (( but )) 

154.37 163.82 B: it's just weird with the whole thing going on it's like you know as soon as the war came up like all of a sudden like france and germany they weren't you know they weren't on our side you know they just like 

162.76 164.13 A: right 

164.03 165.96 B: tried to take a neutral thing 

166.17 167.61 A: right 

166.64 172.21 B: i heard one of them was the country that was selling them the weapons and that's why they didn't take a 

172.89 174.02 B: side 

173.84 175.09 A: right 

174.42 180.27 B: well i don't remember if it was france or germany but one of those countries was supposedly selling them those weapons that they had 

179.85 185.98 A: yeah well i know at at that time there was a lot of talk about how we 

181.05 182.01 B: 'cause they had 

185.99 190.09 A: it was better to go with u._n. sanctions to 

190.31 196.43 A: um not just attack iraq without you know u._n. approval 

196.42 205.99 A: i thought there was there was a lot to be said for that argument we were setting a bad precedent you know by just by just going into iraq without 

206.11 209.40 A: you know agreement from the other countries 

210.26 214.62 B: i just think that like when you see how happy the iraq people are obviously it was 

214.89 220.48 B: like a good thing that we did it i mean if the [noise] citizens of that country 

216.67 218.87 A: right i agree 

222.45 223.41 B: (( are ah )) 

222.49 224.18 A: right i agree yes 

223.49 227.00 B: yeah i mean like if they wouldn't be so happy that we were 

227.12 230.94 B: there if you know if they were going to be over the enemy 

228.58 229.59 A: right 

231.40 232.95 B: (( you know they were )) 

231.55 235.68 A: right they obviously had been oppressed and they were yeah 

233.30 234.84 B: yeah even 

235.19 245.91 B: even their soldiers were more ready to give up you know as soon as they saw them and as soon as they knew that saddam wasn't a threat to them any more they were giving up and giving up their information 

240.32 241.21 A: (( right )) 

242.12 243.66 A: (( right right )) 

245.92 246.85 A: right 

246.26 249.98 B: and somebody had to give us the information where saddam was 

249.96 250.86 A: right 

250.32 253.16 B: i think that was somebody probably close in his 

253.18 258.42 B: little circle of friends 'cause i mean we knew an exact position on this 

254.95 256.64 A: (( right right )) 

258.86 259.86 A: yeah 

258.94 261.46 B: that that one day that they were being hush hush 

261.46 262.62 A: right 

262.54 269.67 B: i mean i know they don't they still don't guarantee that we have him but i think somebody had to you know be against him and tell him 

269.82 275.44 A: oh sure obviously there was a lot of people who really are against saddam hussein 

275.27 286.85 A: understandably so he sounds like a horrible person i just think you know i just heard like last week or two weeks ago india said well they're thinking of of ah 

278.08 279.18 B: [noise] 

286.91 290.77 A: you know of preemptive strike against pakistan now 

291.22 298.59 A: against them yeah and that they should they had more justification for that than we had for ah you know 

291.23 292.67 B: (( oh really )) 

298.64 300.93 A: hitting ah iraq 

301.42 304.28 A: i went oh great you know it's like 

303.05 305.02 B: yeah [noise] 

305.36 309.33 A: what's next and both those countries had nuclear weapons 

310.17 311.42 B: (( [noise] )) 

312.22 315.16 A: so that that concerned me but 

315.18 326.57 A: um and i so because of that i i can see why germany and france would oppose us going in if if they are indeed 

326.65 332.55 A: just wanting ah for the whole united nations to agree on it first 

332.02 335.28 B: yeah i understand that that they should have waited 

334.70 335.81 A: yeah 

335.48 341.58 B: but i i'm still like i mean i think that the whole war thing was kinda like they had a purpose i mean that's 

341.63 343.73 B: i mean he did threaten us though 

344.48 349.99 B: and even when he was talking to his people he said you know that we underestimated him and his country 

349.92 350.87 A: right 

350.30 352.49 B: remember like he obviously intended 

352.97 357.22 B: i think that they probably did have those weapons they probably just hid them somewhere else 

357.48 358.73 A: right 

357.50 365.59 B: i don't i don't know if you were watching the c._n._n. coverage but they um they were talking to another president of another country right near by 

365.54 366.41 A: uh-huh 

365.85 375.73 B: and he was all for saddam hussein i'm like they probably just gave it to him to hold before they even did anything they probably even knew they probably knew we were coming 

371.89 373.18 A: right 

375.64 376.90 A: right 

376.30 379.77 B: at least approximate and then they were just like here you know 

379.62 380.95 A: right 

380.38 383.72 B: and we're don't we're not going to go into his country unless he gives us a reason 

383.69 385.00 A: right 

384.69 386.09 B: (( [mn] see )) 

385.31 399.22 A: yeah i think that is the case i think that's exactly what happened and i think a lot of the iraqis fled to i those i think i guess it was syria that has been helping them out but 

401.85 413.60 A: anyway [sigh] i i also know that now there's a lot of opposition to ah you know the american troops staying in iraq very long a lot of 

413.67 421.40 A: you know you're hearing at least i'm hearing a lot of opposition to them staying that they want 'em out as soon as possible 

420.76 422.27 B: that who wants them out 

422.18 423.51 A: the iraqis 

423.29 424.49 B: (( oh really )) 

424.28 425.18 A: uh-huh 

425.35 430.26 A: yeah because basically they're saying we don't want an occupying 

430.40 438.21 A: army in our country we we want to have our own country back and that's understandable um 

438.75 443.92 B: i mean yeah that is understandable but i thought they like needed help for forming their government and everything 

444.55 447.70 A: well yeah i think they did 

446.44 451.59 B: 'cause how do we know that we just did all this and they're just going to have some other guy just like saddam just take over again 

451.43 453.56 A: right well 

452.31 456.62 B: 'cause that could happen if we don't give them some kind of you know 

456.63 459.44 B: help getting their country organized and everything 

459.07 460.77 A: right right 

459.49 462.89 B: because they obviously you heard about all that money they found right 

462.61 464.93 A: yeah i did 

463.32 465.71 B: so obviously the country was not poor 

466.01 469.52 B: but he let like his country like his people like that 

469.41 470.38 A: right 

469.65 471.90 B: and they had all that money sitting there 

471.44 472.64 A: yeah 

473.17 476.10 A: yeah i understood that he and ah right 

473.74 481.64 B: i mean that's that's exactly the same that he did that i mean he had all that money for his country and they're sitting there i mean they just the wa- you can tell just the way they are you know 

481.53 482.67 A: right 

482.12 486.28 B: it's just like that's a shame that he had all that money and didn't even do anything for his country 

485.95 488.06 A: right yeah 

486.64 489.93 B: he just had 'em in boxes just sitting there spread it out 

490.00 493.32 B: i think they were keeping it for themselves the individuals 

492.91 494.16 A: absolutely 

494.95 499.71 A: yeah i think it's great that that he's out and i hope they catch him 

500.97 502.70 A: yeah 

504.38 511.85 A: but ah what's happening with north korea [laughter] oh god i hope that that gets resolved 

510.08 513.30 B: i know i didn't even hear that much anything about them really 

513.22 514.30 A: uh-huh 

515.21 529.27 A: well they didn't you know for a while they were getting really threatening at least you know their rhetoric was sounding very threatening i guess now they are backing off and they're agreeing to talk to south korea and now 

529.32 531.95 A: possibly us also and 

531.26 536.26 B: we just don't need any any other countries just jumping the gun at war and all that stuff you know i mean 

536.15 537.18 A: right 

536.59 543.75 B: because i i was scared at first 'cause i thought like you know oh that was just initialized like a world war if we all just jumped at it you know 

543.51 547.10 A: yeah i think a lot of us were scared of that exactly 

545.64 550.05 B: especially when like you know the countries that were not agai- like for the war was like 

550.24 551.18 B: (( you know )) 

551.27 553.79 B: you just hope that nothing happened from there you know 

553.68 556.38 A: yeah yeah 

556.55 565.38 A: yeah i mean it's it's scary stuff all these weapons that people have countries have and 

564.57 571.49 B: yeah and and you don't know what they have you don't really know what they have i mean they could always keep it a secret and you wouldn't know 

567.48 568.67 A: right 

571.46 572.46 A: right 

571.84 575.46 B: you want to see a look at nine eleven like they really didn't see that coming 

576.40 577.98 A: well some people 

576.90 585.12 B: i heard they knew something but they didn't know like exact spot or anything but even if it is if it's that kind of weapon what can you do to stop it mid air you know 

580.25 581.91 A: right exactly 

585.02 586.48 A: right 

585.92 589.28 B: i mean if they're already you have to know exactly what planes they're on and [laughter] 

589.46 590.40 B: (( you know )) 

590.26 592.39 A: yeah and it's kind of 

592.72 596.13 B: i think what's scary is all the people in our country that are still terrorists 

596.52 597.62 A: right 

596.83 599.95 B: there's terrorists like that are coming after us for us and
