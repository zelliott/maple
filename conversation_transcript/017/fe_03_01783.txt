145.88 146.90 B: mhm 

158.00 159.16 B: oh wow 

158.37 161.53 A: i think i think that's exceptions

169.79 171.61 B: yeah i'm in pennsylvania as well 

171.59 181.97 A: your and ah they were involved with a computer school but the school had ah problems getting reimbursement from the state and had all kinds of financial problems 

181.85 182.85 B: oh boy 

182.51 188.20 A: but but there were two girls and and they both had their own computer and ah 

188.54 200.16 A: all kinds of programmes to do things and this was supposed to be a computer school that lasted for twelve years and went on but it got it got so bad as far as 

200.17 204.70 A: ah a lot of the school districts were trying to withhold the money and and ah 

204.91 209.70 A: not sending it through to them so that they just 

209.92 215.94 A: ah were not working properly so my daughter put those two in public school now 

215.94 218.34 B: oh wow that's that's a shame 

216.66 220.32 A: but but 

218.42 230.58 B: i remember i remember when i was in high school i mean we had a computer lab but we weren't allowed to touch the computers it was locked all the time and i mean i've i've only been out of high school wow i guess ten years now 

224.39 225.26 A: (( ha )) 

230.63 231.60 B: so 

231.62 238.80 B: it it has come so far from what i've heard from my friend's younger sisters they're on the computer so much and they can do all kinds of things 

238.81 241.12 B: (( and our school was very basic )) 

241.62 248.77 B: d._o._s. thing you think d._o._s. which you don't even use now any more the the normal platform is windows 

248.13 256.82 A: right i never even ah i never had a computer until it became ah windows so i don't even know how to use d._o._s. or how it works 

256.52 258.79 B: yeah i know and then taught us this stuff that 

259.69 267.35 B: was completely useless we were we were barely allowed to use the computers back then the two kids to a computer 

267.36 272.33 B: and it was just ridiculous and now it just seems like you know 

272.47 281.22 B: i i don't know how it is now in the public schools but it seems like they don't get enough computer time but on the other hand if you use it all the time 

281.65 296.10 B: you're not using all your resources i mean just going outside especially for younger children just go outside and learn science that way look at the bugs look at the trees grow the beans yourself instead of you know 

296.04 299.46 B: doing little computer games and stuff all the time for it 

299.34 310.13 A: yeah and i don't know how that's going to impact my two grandsons because they they are home schooled and ah in their house they have three computers 

306.85 307.76 B: mhm 

310.95 314.05 A: [laughter] two two two children three computers

322.30 323.36 B: mhm 

325.37 334.81 B: yeah well i'm sure the school district probably has requirements that that your daughter or daughter in law i'm not sure if you said which has to go through 

332.82 334.18 A: well they have to 

334.64 344.05 A: yeah they have to take ah a test you know every year but they they show up proficient in that as far as that goes you know high proficiency 

341.40 343.04 B: (( well that's wonderful )) 

344.16 350.22 A: but but like you said ah i don't know about the reading and libraries or 

350.29 353.32 A: ah going to suffer from it i'm sure 

352.92 354.40 B: yeah i mean 

354.71 358.13 B: all the local libraries here in my area are very small 

358.29 359.62 B: not very 

359.72 363.92 B: not very used very frequently i mean the largest one is 

364.58 367.42 B: what what i would call still very small 

367.46 369.65 B: in the area that we're in 

369.51 370.88 A: mhm 

370.74 382.32 B: and the books are so old i mean half the time they are trying to sell all the old books but i don't see very many new books the children's section is always you know great but the rest of the library is kind of pitiful 

382.12 383.21 A: uh-huh 

383.33 386.63 A: you know i do have some friends ah 

386.57 401.48 A: i'm a retired minister for one thing and ah i have some friends that are pastors in this area that are not ordained yet have not finished their studies and they are they are doing their studying on line

401.74 403.97 A: ah do a 

401.97 404.46 B: yeah that's pretty neat

409.95 411.35 B: oh okay 

411.54 412.73 A: but 

411.66 422.51 B: yeah i've heard of a lot of i i mean i think it's wonderful for like for college students especially for adults who are going back to school or completing their education or for instance your friends 

422.66 431.80 B: who who can continue to go to their jobs or continue to parent their children and still go to college and and do those things 

428.91 430.82 A: yeah 

431.38 440.05 A: yeah this guy is a pastor in the church and and his wife is working at least a part-time job and and he's he's baby sitting the children when she's working 

440.54 443.28 B: he is not baby sitting his own children 

442.87 444.83 A: [laughter] 

443.82 447.30 B: [laughter] sorry it's one of my pet peeves 

447.00 448.60 A: [laughter] 

448.65 451.75 A: well i guess he isn't i you're right 

452.22 462.37 B: [laughter] oh no yeah like i said one of my friends is doing the same thing and like with three kids it's a lot har- easier to do it that way 

462.39 465.31 B: now that that opportunity is available to them 

465.27 466.63 A: mhm 

466.99 477.47 B: but um like i said my husband is going to i._t._t. tech he's learning computer network systems and he does some of his he had to buy a laptop just for school 

477.44 491.83 B: so he could take it back and forth to work and do all his he's he's been doing programmes and writing programmes and he keeps coming back to me and saying i just found out this about windows and he'll tell me all the little nasty little things that are going on and 

491.74 497.36 B: we're going to run this computer system now and we're going to run this and through this server and do this to it you know 

498.13 507.66 B: everybody can't see what we're doing and the more he learns about microsoft and the whole way everything works makes me nervous 

507.03 508.17 A: uh-huh 

508.29 511.92 A: and and there's so much out there to learn too i 

510.89 512.73 B: oh yeah i mean 

512.02 512.78 A: mean 

512.75 517.06 B: oh it just kills me the amount of information he comes home with 

517.59 525.51 A: i i suppose one of the ah drawbacks and that's what they want us to talk about too is the fact that ah 

526.05 536.19 A: you can you can learn what you want to learn but you might zero in on certain things and certain areas and not necessarily learn everything that you need to learn 

528.66 529.65 B: mhm 

536.02 541.28 B: sure and you know what there's a lot of misinformation out there on the internet too 

540.86 544.99 A: oh yeah i haven't thought about that but that's right 

543.16 544.86 B: you just put in 

545.30 552.50 B: one you know whatever you want to learn about and into your search engine and it will come up with like three thousand pages 

551.97 553.38 A: oh yeah 

552.33 565.06 B: and you come put race in there and you'll come up with anything that has the word race in it almost so you could come up with web pages for members of the ku klux klan you could come up with 

564.85 570.03 B: web pages for all kinds of things i mean there's children who 

570.40 574.66 B: who are you know learn how to build bombs on line 

573.16 574.20 A: (( mhm )) 

574.72 575.55 A: (( yes )) 

575.64 576.65 B: so 

576.86 583.24 B: there's lots of ways to get misinformation and that is definitely a concern with with children 

583.44 589.24 B: and teenagers that you have to monitor what they're accessing what they're learning and make sure that 

589.53 592.60 B: what they're learning is what their teacher intended [laughter] 

592.50 594.40 A: yes that's right 

594.42 599.06 A: ah i know i have researched ah cancer for instance 

598.73 599.89 B: mhm 

599.34 599.89 A: and
