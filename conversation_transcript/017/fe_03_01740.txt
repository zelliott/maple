130.09 131.88 B: [laughter] i agree 

131.69 146.60 A: i am just totally um tired of talking or thinking about it is any one a threat yes i do think other people are a threat and i think america is too trusting to other countries and um that's definitely what i have to say about that 

146.84 147.74 B: [laughter] 

147.05 151.64 A: um you know um one minute we you know um 

151.54 162.13 A: anyway but yeah do i think so i think korea is definitely a threat and i think that there is other countries that we think are our allies that are um holding um 

162.15 170.43 A: have weapons and are aiding other countries that are our enemies that are having you know i think basically we can't trust anyone 

167.66 169.14 B: like germany and france 

170.22 173.17 B: right that is very true who do 

172.32 173.62 A: that is my view 

173.31 178.26 B: who do you think might be holding weapons germany france both of them 

177.34 179.30 A: oh definitely france 

178.72 180.59 B: (( okay all right )) 

179.86 183.71 A: i think they've been aiding other countries definitely russia 

183.28 187.18 B: yeah right i think russia always has and always will 

184.89 186.05 A: and korea 

186.12 192.74 A: but you know i mean i know basic knowledge about the subject you know this sounds dumb but i thought we were going to discuss toys 

193.05 194.67 B: (( oh how did you get that thought )) 

194.41 196.24 A: well isn't it fisher price 

196.20 199.28 B: well it's fisher but not fisher price no 

198.62 202.75 A: oh my gosh you're going to think i'm dumb i thought it was like the toy company 

200.24 200.84 B: (( no )) 

202.14 211.49 B: well but see on these different when i've done these before like every day is a different topic so they j- all they're doing is studying voice patterns 

211.53 214.83 B: that's all they're getting out of this is our voice patterns 

214.76 218.17 A: so wait aren't they wanting to know the information we're discussing 

217.61 219.46 B: not particularly no 

219.97 224.74 B: [mn] not from what i know you do not have to positively stay on track no 

224.15 232.16 A: oh g- boy i'm not that great at staying on track but i figure we should discuss it at least a little bit so i mean we ma- so you get paid ten dollars a call 

228.87 229.72 B: [laughter] 

231.79 232.68 B: right 

232.96 234.94 B: right you should too 

234.00 236.07 A: that's really a- amazing 

235.67 239.69 B: right ten dollars a call and i- if it's like the other ones i've done they're very 

239.77 240.72 B: legit 

239.83 244.23 A: well you know something i did get is i got caller id 

243.96 245.08 B: right 

244.49 252.68 A: and i have not had it but maybe a week and a half by the way if someone dings on the other line i'll just let it go to voicemail but i have not had it for 

250.45 251.47 B: okay 

252.67 260.97 A: and i tell you what it is such a blessing when i saw the two one five penn state and i thought what's this it didn't because what i've noticed do you have caller id 

259.90 262.47 B: yes and it's university of penn right 

262.16 274.69 A: yes exactly that's what this said and i thought you know what because i didn't know who it was and i thought well i'll answer it and if i find out that it's a sales call then i know i won't answer it but i've noticed that for me and i don't know what you've noticed but the sales calls have been 

262.49 263.31 B: shows up 

275.00 276.08 A: either 

276.43 278.00 A: no data 

277.77 278.75 B: right 

278.06 283.77 A: out of area unavailable or blocked call those are the four is that kinda what yours comes up as 

283.31 291.02 B: it is um although indiana is under a new thing you can be on a no call list so we're on that for no telemarketers 

290.98 300.31 B: and that really makes a difference so we signed our our phone number is no telemarketers could call us and they can be fined by the state if they do call 

300.22 301.38 A: oh 

300.33 303.10 B: it's gonna be something that's gonna be um 

303.43 307.25 B: worldwide eventually but right now indiana is a test market for it 

307.26 308.83 A: oh 

307.46 318.16 B: so it's we don't get very many at all telemarketers like we used to get so you used to get bombarded by 'em but you know with caller id you can screen 'em and get rid of 'em so 

317.45 318.85 A: wow 

318.23 329.02 B: if you don't want 'em [laughter] hang up on 'em i've been lately getting a lot of uh people calling for surveys but like on internet when you do a survey at least you're generally entered into a drawing for money 

328.86 330.32 A: exactly 

329.82 335.87 B: but these the surveys lately that i were getting are just wanting your opinion for free so 

335.16 338.44 A: oh really 'cause usually they want you to be in a focus group don't they 

338.12 338.79 B: (( w- )) 

338.82 347.31 B: i used to be in focus groups but indiana doesn't have focus groups there's they don't know of that concept yet when i lived in minneapolis 

346.61 348.73 A: are you from indiana originally 

348.42 351.23 B: yeah lafayette yeah so 

350.94 354.01 A: do you like indiana better or minnesota 

353.39 358.91 B: minnesota minnesota go back in a second oh i really really liked minnesota 

358.23 360.90 A: now why do you like minnesota better than indiana 

360.74 366.84 B: i think it was better for my kids oh i think the education up there was a lot better so but 

366.11 371.27 A: yeah i was gonna say um my husband lived near goshinary and he didn't care 

370.20 374.02 B: sure sure down right down the road a piece [laughter] 

373.14 377.78 A: he did not care for it in that area but he's from the upper peninsula of michigan 

377.45 378.67 B: (( oh okay )) 

378.70 387.03 A: and like i said i'm fr- i live in dallas i've lived here like fourteen years or maybe fifteen years and i moved here after college when i was twenty two 

386.94 396.35 A: and um but i'm originally from woodberry minnesota which is a suburb of st pauls so isn't that weird what i was so wait now what do you do for a living now 

391.91 393.07 B: (( that's cool )) 

396.10 400.37 B: um i'm an educational surrogate for homeless kids in the school district 

400.60 407.57 B: so anybody that's homeless um that's a student then i go in and represent 'em it's kinda interest 

406.55 408.03 A: education you try to help 'em 

407.75 412.94 B: yeah exactly it's volunteer but um state law requires that they have a uh 

413.07 417.12 B: surrogate of some sort to represent 'em so yeah 

416.34 422.20 A: no sweet now do you also um help your kids at i mean do your kids go to actual school too 

421.72 424.01 B: yeah yeah so i can 

424.04 428.14 B: go in and check on them while i'm in helping these other kids too you're right 

427.69 432.97 A: see that's nice of you in other words you're a basically you're a stay at home mum and you do these things 

431.98 439.52 B: right but i did this so i can uh kinda be in there with my kids and see no one can question me when i'm in the school then 

439.53 441.69 B: i'm in for a reason so i can 

440.96 443.58 A: well no one should question you anyway right 

442.88 453.68 B: well see in minnesota that's okay you can do that but here they don't like mums coming into the classroom in minnesota i did it all the time i'd just walk in if i wanted to see my kid i walked right in 

453.91 460.65 B: but here they you don't do that they just they don't that's not cool you just do not do that so 

460.14 461.34 A: really 

460.64 471.92 B: i've kinda broken that pattern of uh [mn] this is what we do do and we walk in if we want to see 'em and not to disrupt them and not to necessarily be nitpicking but just to see what they're 

471.12 477.17 A: yeah to me i mean as long as you're not living the kids up because i taught school for nine years and there was this one parent that would 

476.93 486.99 A: basically get the kids really disrupted and it would get 'em all wild but as long as the child's not crying and you're going in to visit her to help i don't i think you should be able to go in whenever you want 

479.05 480.07 B: right 

480.52 481.69 B: right 

485.48 486.42 B: you should 

486.47 500.12 B: and legally we should have that right but here you don't have that right to walk in you may not walk in without uh notifying the school twenty four hours before your visit well then in twenty four hours the teacher's gonna be all ready for you coming 

488.68 490.10 A: exactly 

500.17 505.74 B: not that they're doing anything wrong but that's not the idea of a spontaneous visit 

504.15 511.26 A: but it's good to be involved i mean i'm not even talking of checking on the teacher but you know hey john you know 'cause i mean teacher's work is hard 

507.23 508.06 B: right 

510.85 511.73 B: right 

511.07 520.16 A: you know hey johnny over there needs some you know help ready and teacher's helping one of the other kids take over and work with johnny for a little bit see if you don't you know why not 

517.39 518.90 B: right right 

519.48 526.74 B: as long as you're in there you can do it but they just don't believe in that they've never had that and they don't know what that is and i i really 

525.88 528.72 A: well you don't think the education level's as good 

527.96 531.36 B: oh it isn't by far no no way uh-uh 

530.79 544.88 A: because you know what i had a really good education and i'm going to tell you something right now and don't take this wrong whatever i don't want you send me the phone number when you end up hanging up on me because you're mad but i recruit people to do merchandising jobs 

544.32 545.51 B: i do that too 

545.73 549.62 A: you do merchandising and mystery shopping do you know who i am dawn hunt 

546.63 547.42 B: yeah

557.22 558.12 A: that 

559.38 567.25 A: is so bizarre because you know what the people from i'm not scheduling them anymore because the- her shoppers did not like me 

560.52 561.92 B: [laughter] 

562.11 563.24 B: small world 

567.57 573.10 B: but you're not the only one that's done haciendas and you're like the third one that's done haciendas 

572.46 573.80 A: you mean schedule them 

573.36 576.82 B: yeah well it sure their company that's done 'em 

577.15 581.30 B: so hacien- it's not you it's hacienda they don't like the reports they're getting 

581.28 583.33 A: no it's not hacienda at all 

583.16 584.15 B: so it's 

583.29 596.83 A: it's the shoppers because guess what i sent a note out i don't know if you were one of the ones that got it 'cause kim told me not to send it out but i sent a note out saying thank you to all the shoppers and i sent this gi- i wanna know if you got that did you 

595.97 597.44 B: i didn't get that 

596.90 599.89 A: okay well that's bec- then you must have done it afterwards
