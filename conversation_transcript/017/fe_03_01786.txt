0.07 1.16 B: hello 

0.76 1.96 A: hello 

1.53 3.01 B: hi i'm angie 

2.63 4.75 A: oh hi angie my name is leslie 

4.61 6.34 B: nice to meet you [mn] 

5.38 6.73 A: good to meet to you 

7.13 8.56 B: [mn] okay 

8.12 12.30 A: so our topic is computers in education 

11.79 13.19 B: yeah 

12.40 13.55 A: okay 

14.58 17.54 B: um do you want to go first 

14.66 15.50 A: well 

16.93 18.46 A: no go right ahead 

17.78 25.74 B: [laughter] i don't know if i have too much to say well i guess um i would have to say that it um would only be a good thing 

25.59 26.48 A: mhm 

25.81 28.32 B: to um i can't remember if they 

28.33 35.42 B: if they're talking about any specific level of education but i think at all levels of education that it would be good to incorporate computers 

34.86 35.72 A: (( ahah )) 

35.77 36.79 A: okay 

37.12 38.89 A: um yeah i guess i 

38.96 44.27 A: [mn] i feel that um yeah computers are great especially for research 

44.35 45.39 B: yes 

44.41 50.26 A: you know in lieu of um well the old way kids used to do it with encyclopedias and 

50.04 51.39 B: right 

50.39 55.62 A: you know um and but especially within the library having computers available 

55.34 56.26 B: right 

55.63 58.34 A: i think is very important and 

58.44 62.07 A: at i think at the pre school and kindergarten level 

62.18 63.73 A: sometimes the kids 

63.96 67.80 A: aren't super interested but i think they should still be available 

67.54 68.59 B: right 

67.95 71.70 A: you know i know kids get into the games and that kind of thing 

71.81 73.12 B: yeah 

71.93 73.59 A: but sometimes 

74.07 80.60 A: i believe it's great to have the mind just be able to stimulate on its own not have to have something to 

81.83 83.56 A: [mn] i guess trigger it 

82.96 84.34 B: yeah that's true 

83.91 96.41 A: um because it reminds me in some ways it's like t._v. you know if you actually watch somebody sit in front of a computer sometimes they ha- also have that glaze over their [laughter] over their eyes and i think it's it's good if you know 

88.00 89.28 B: mhm 

92.12 94.47 B: right mhm 

96.34 102.38 A: probably there is some limit to its use in schools you know not hours and hours but 

102.22 104.82 B: right i was thinking um 

104.94 109.43 B: in terms of ah i know what you are saying um about um 

110.03 111.75 B: in terms of ah 

112.00 123.03 B: [mn] um not being able to or it might be better f- sometimes it might be better for a child to um do things outside of the computer in terms of developing their skills and imagination and so forth 

122.68 124.68 A: exactly yes 

123.28 126.74 B: yeah i mean i was also thinking about um 

127.27 138.77 B: ah professional development or just making sure that they are um skilled in com- computers because um it's very basic i guess it now basic knowledge of computers is should be 

138.83 149.85 B: or is often taken for granted by employers or something so maybe um it would be good to make sure that um all children have access to that type of knowledge and skill 

149.57 152.27 A: mhm mhm definitely 

150.60 152.35 B: yeah 

152.58 153.55 B: yeah 

153.05 154.92 A: and i i know that um 

155.11 158.85 A: i've heard that bill gates has provided a lot of computers 

158.94 164.73 A: to kids in some of the poor neighborhoods and he he supposedly has some big program going so that 

164.86 166.11 A: (( you know a- a- )) 

166.40 168.32 A: in all economic 

168.99 172.80 A: you know classes that it that it is something that's included 

172.22 174.33 B: right that's true 

173.90 175.42 A: (( in the curriculum but )) 

176.33 177.89 A: yeah i remember um 

177.99 183.70 A: when my daughter was in her kindergarten they had computers but the teacher um 

183.80 188.38 A: she was at a montessori told me that honestly kids never on their own [laughter] go over there 

187.88 189.11 B: really 

188.48 194.16 A: they didn't that she said they have so much to do here there's other things and that is not something that they 

191.28 192.35 B: mhm 

194.26 198.13 A: they choose right off you know sometimes we encourage 

195.82 203.28 B: it's true 'cause especially for young kids they might not be able to sit still you know they might want to do something more active and hands on 

202.93 210.28 A: right and [mn] apparently there were so many choices offered that that just wasn't one of them that was high up on the list 

203.73 204.73 B: yeah 

209.72 210.84 B: right 

210.51 212.77 A: you know and i thought that was interesting then 

213.83 215.00 B: yeah 

213.98 219.28 A: on their own they probably wouldn't have gone there first but even that's at a pretty young age 

218.96 220.12 B: yeah 

220.23 229.71 B: yeah but i agree with you in terms of um having it available um so that they can learn but not necessarily imposing it upon them you know at such an early age 

227.88 228.85 A: mhm 

229.18 241.14 A: yes definitely because i know that some of the computer games get pretty addicting even for adults [laughter] and and it can be a big time waster i mean i i think i've done my share of you know 

230.10 232.22 B: (( yeah )) 

235.01 237.12 B: yeah that's true 

241.51 242.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

241.86 245.39 A: solitaire and some of the other games on there that just 

245.74 250.96 A: you can just do 'em over and over again and not realise how much time is going by and 

248.21 249.86 B: right 

251.07 256.58 B: right if you use the computer as a yeah just to be something to play video games on 

251.83 252.71 A: yeah 

253.99 254.94 A: mhm 

256.31 257.32 A: yes 

256.88 257.87 B: um 

258.11 269.77 B: yeah and then i wonder if i don't know how people do it but um when they want to block all of like the pornography and other sites you know so that their children can use it um 

268.99 270.04 A: (( yes mhm )) 

270.11 272.05 B: if they can do that i don't know 

272.06 280.60 A: w- well i believe so at the um in the schools they they have software that doesn't allow ah certain things to come up and 

280.93 289.76 A: i know there was some controversy about public library systems um doing that some people said that would that hampers you know freedom of 

284.36 285.44 B: mhm 

289.82 294.28 A: information or i think that's what they were claiming but 

291.00 291.92 B: right 

294.43 296.36 A: to me there's just too much 

296.91 301.83 A: opportunity for kids um you know anybody under eighteen to just get on and have 

302.05 306.62 A: different things popping up so i think some libraries at least have 

303.33 304.35 B: right 

306.77 309.15 A: have done something to protect children 

309.50 312.30 B: yeah i wonder how they block those sites 

309.56 310.90 A: (( [mn] )) 

312.74 315.26 A: well there's software that you can download 

312.82 313.49 B: (( um )) 

315.10 316.10 B: really 

315.33 317.22 A: that will yeah and i guess 

317.35 325.55 A: you know it picks up on on language and you know something like that in order to give it a block and you can even get it blocked from your email 

321.09 322.84 B: images maybe 

325.52 326.09 B: (( [noise] )) 

325.60 328.96 A: but i haven't actually done that i haven't downloaded that myself 

328.51 330.80 B: [noise] you know one time i um 

331.21 334.47 B: i sent like an an email to um 

334.49 344.17 B: my adviser and um it autom- automatically got trashed because i think in the subject line the word offer was there 

344.41 345.69 A: oh 

344.60 345.44 B: and 

345.45 356.45 B: so [laughter] she found it like months later and she was like oh i'm so sorry but she has like this automatic thing on her email that anything that has like specific words in the subject heading yeah 

354.48 355.74 A: oh 

355.85 357.10 A: what was the word 

356.83 358.32 B: it was offer 

357.88 358.92 A: huh 

358.73 360.12 B: yeah 

359.62 362.17 A: gosh that's an yeah well 

362.75 364.59 A: i guess it can go too far 

364.11 365.38 B: [laughter] 

364.73 370.92 A: [laughter] i had um well i know this lady that's a a teacher at a public school and she said she's 

371.12 376.86 A: using a really good site um for her science she teaches science i think it's seventh grade 

376.45 377.59 B: mhm 

377.20 380.80 A: and she has a great site that's um goes [mn] 

380.91 385.35 A: into all the migrations of all the different birds um 

385.68 388.24 A: you know geese hawks everything 

387.95 389.04 B: yeah 

388.35 397.97 A: and she's got her class involved in that and doing certain projects like tracking different migrations and seeing where that particular species is right now and 

394.65 396.15 B: (( mm )) 

397.24 398.32 B: mhm 

398.02 402.66 A: they got into like in february apparently it was mating season for owls 

402.09 403.44 B: oh [laughter] 

402.84 415.87 A: you know and she had them out [mn] listening for owl calls and on this site of course you know they had you could if you had speakers you could hear what it might sound like and kids were going out and doing this and i thought gosh that's great i mean she was really using it to the 

415.56 417.09 B: yeah 

416.08 425.66 A: you know to the full and um i checked it out 'cause she said oh you oughta just look it's really interesting and i did and i thought that's an excellent use right there 

425.00 438.97 B: yeah and it seems like if um com- if um teachers are going to use computers effectively in the classroom that there should be some type of training or development in terms of the teachers so that they know how to like your friend does um 

438.45 439.53 A: yes 

439.14 442.11 B: use it to its maximum to the best benefit 

441.74 454.61 A: absolutely yeah and i don't know how she found that site or if it was i think it it may have been specifically developed for teachers and all 'cause when i went on there thinking back now they did have a place for 

454.62 459.94 A: teachers to go to the general public kids you know so they'd 

457.40 458.38 B: mhm 

460.49 463.02 A: you know give you the information at whatever level 

462.85 463.92 B: right 

463.21 464.68 A: you know you were seeking it 

465.15 471.34 B: yeah i remember the first time i touched a computer was in when i was a college undergraduate 

470.86 472.71 A: r- oh really yeah 

471.45 479.64 B: yeah and um just thinking like oh this is weird like why can't why don't i just use my computer or my typewriter or something 

472.87 473.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

478.76 480.35 A: (( oh yes )) 

479.75 482.29 B: [laughter] and um 

482.42 496.07 B: yeah and borrowing my friend's computer so i could go do some things i i remember and when email came out and stuff but now it's just you know [mn] like prevalent in everyday life that everyone needs to know 

493.05 495.15 A: [noise] i know 

495.75 501.27 A: yeah i know it's grown tremendously just in the last five years 

501.08 502.18 B: right 

501.49 504.18 A: and i think i first went on the internet 

504.46 505.98 A: in ninety seven 

505.65 506.70 B: mhm 

506.64 509.25 A: ninety six yeah might've been ninety six 

509.95 513.38 A: and you know a friend of mine had been talking about it for a couple of years 

513.39 516.02 A: you know he knew all about it he was very up on that 

515.87 516.98 B: yeah 

516.34 520.07 A: and yeah it was it was pretty interesting and 

520.67 521.75 A: i think my 

522.06 526.49 A: nieces started having it you know when they first started school 

526.29 527.28 B: mhm 

526.66 528.87 A: you know now they i mean they're using it 

529.27 530.47 B: yeah 

529.36 535.69 A: all the time they they know an awful lot 'cause they are learning younger and i think they are a lot more adept with the mouse 

535.52 536.57 B: mhm 

535.90 540.41 A: than i thought they'd be [laughter] i mean they have no problem you know with 

537.82 538.74 B: (( [laughter] )) 

539.81 541.98 B: right working the computer 

541.32 542.27 A: mhm 

542.57 543.76 B: (( that's true )) 

544.26 546.50 B: and i was thinking about how um 

546.64 550.49 B: educators today might be of the older generation and might not 

550.62 553.87 B: you know really know how to use the computer in the classroom or 

553.63 554.75 A: mhm 

554.12 559.60 B: i know some professors that just don't even use like they only use it for email and that's it you know 

558.86 560.80 A: oh really oh gosh 

560.25 564.84 B: i guess inward processing but not like as a as a tool for teaching 

561.02 561.83 A: huh 

564.67 565.47 A: (( ahah )) 

565.58 566.58 B: (( yeah )) 

566.90 575.59 A: yeah oh no i think it's got a lot of potential for yeah especially research and reports and things like that because you have so much more at your 

572.61 573.61 B: (( [noise] right )) 

575.63 588.73 A: disposal you don't have to leave your house or you don't have to have your you know your parents don't have to have bought you all these encyclopedias [mn] yeah you've you've got something even bigger right there 'cause you can get into the library of congress and 

582.80 584.05 B: right 

588.41 589.51 B: yeah 

588.71 592.25 A: you know i mean just worldwide you can tap into 

592.58 599.95 B: right i i'm teaching a class right now and my students tot- like for their class presentations we have a a m- 

593.54 595.07 A: so much
