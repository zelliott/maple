123.39 126.11 A: mhm so you were in 

126.17 127.16 A: um 

127.84 135.86 A: did you find your sister and everything how long was it before you found your sister was she in new york at the time and

156.18 157.12 A: (( oh my )) 

157.01 163.23 B: and my brother couldn't call anybody it was weird nobody in new york could call each other but they could call me 

162.69 163.76 A: oh 

163.40 171.44 B: so it turned out that he kept calling me had to stop at pay phones because his cell phone wouldn't work 'cause all ever- you know everything was jammed up there 

171.03 171.97 A: uh-huh 

172.04 176.07 B: and he kept he couldn't get back to new york to even look for her 

176.26 177.36 A: mhm 

176.46 181.33 B: and i just kept trying all the numbers i had for her and finally i got a message 

181.53 182.60 A: mhm 

181.74 183.76 B: that she was okay 

183.72 184.41 A: oh 

184.48 185.94 B: and then i had to call 

184.75 187.45 A: so you were pretty close to the whole thing weren't you 

187.46 188.34 A: (( that was )) 

187.52 201.12 B: yeah and also her mother was in manhattan at the time and she went to her friend's apartment but she didn't know her daughter was alive because she couldn't get through to anybody i was the only one to get through to let everybody know that everybody was okay 

188.56 189.64 A: (( that's kind of )) 

200.22 202.92 A: oh oh my goodness sake [noise] 

202.61 205.25 B: yeah that was a really bad day 

205.47 212.38 A: so then you're pretty close to oh even iraq and you did you want the war then in iraq 

212.47 219.34 B: yes i did and um i don't know if you're familiar with virginia beach at all it is very military 

213.39 214.36 A: mhm 

219.42 220.51 A: oh really 

220.07 222.52 B: yes military bases there's 

222.65 227.02 B: camp pendleton which is marines we have a navy base 

226.44 227.80 A: (( mhm )) 

227.12 228.83 B: we um 

229.07 235.64 B: have you know a norfolk terminal which all the aircraft carriers come into 

234.55 235.58 A: mhm 

235.72 238.35 B: so it's very military down here 

238.39 242.69 B: and so i sup- sup- support the war and i support our troops 

242.72 243.81 A: mhm 

243.35 247.85 B: um you know i feel bad for the people over there in iraq 

248.09 249.14 A: mhm 

249.50 252.42 B: just the civilians and everyday people 

251.21 252.05 A: yeah 

252.21 264.59 B: 'cause a lot of them got harmed but yes i was for the war i was kind of hoping that osama bin laden was going to be found in iraq [laughter] but that didn't pan out and we still haven't even found saddam hussein 

259.11 260.99 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

264.10 265.56 A: mhm 

265.56 266.79 B: but 

265.92 273.27 A: well i i feel that um of course you're a little bit closer but i when you get 

273.54 281.83 A: i'm i'm not really near a military base and of course my daughter travels quite a bit and she lives in phoenix 

281.94 283.56 A: and she 

283.90 287.49 A: she was bothered by it she said after the 

287.58 290.89 A: uh nine eleven she felt that every time a plane 

291.12 293.29 A: came over it might have 

293.57 302.80 A: [laughter] it could have hit her house or something like that she lives in the middle of phoenix and but she was a little you know concerned on that way but uh 

295.90 297.03 B: yeah 

297.95 299.14 B: mhm 

301.19 302.23 B: right 

303.00 309.23 A: syria you know i just kind of i'm kind of neutral i'm kind of like wait and see 

309.58 310.64 A: (( i i )) 

309.64 313.16 B: i think i you know they say that were i think they were 

310.99 311.59 A: (( am )) 

313.22 314.92 B: helping saddam hussein 

314.85 315.78 A: uh-huh 

315.33 325.94 B: i do but i mean that's just my personal opinion i think i don't think all the truth will come out i mean we still haven't even found out if iraq did have weapons of mass destruction so 

320.34 321.13 A: (( [noise] )) 

324.31 325.25 A: mhm 

327.18 330.78 B: but yeah korea korea is definitely a worry too though 

327.56 328.98 A: well i think they'll still 

330.50 331.40 A: uh-huh 

330.97 337.21 B: i mean i agree with you on that one i think while we are busy with iraq they're [laughter] busy 

337.30 338.37 A: planning 

338.02 340.92 B: planning making bombs of mass destruction 

338.96 342.43 A: and getting a lot of atomic weapons and stuff like that 

341.59 344.33 B: mhm yep 

344.02 348.23 A: and i really don't think that we can really deal with them like cl- 

348.26 349.56 A: the way clinton 

349.87 355.47 A: you know dealt with them give 'em money and then say okay now you stop 

352.24 353.79 B: mhm 

355.62 361.47 A: i think now you you stop and then we'll talk about money [laughter] 

360.64 361.87 B: i agree 

361.83 371.31 A: [laughter] i don't think we should give them any more money i think that's kind of a ploy and and um i really feel that 

362.17 363.91 B: i agree with that too 

368.30 369.56 B: mhm 

371.65 385.86 A: um but i think after the war in iraq i think they have to look at their situation and say hey maybe we'll do what we say [laughter] you know and go in there and say okay now it's your turn you know 

381.50 383.03 B: mhm 

385.56 392.06 B: yeah that's what i'm hoping too that maybe these countries will see that president bush won't just be pushed around 

391.35 392.35 A: mhm 

392.12 393.86 B: you know they have to 

393.96 397.36 B: comply with the u._n. regulations and 

397.78 403.71 B: come forward if they do have any of these weapons 'cause if they don't guess what we're going to be knocking on your door next 

403.20 404.09 A: mhm 

404.39 412.66 A: well are you uh doing anything different as far as uh safety is concerned you know like okay 

412.76 419.71 A: what if um you have more terrorist attacks what are you are you doing anything personally to 

419.72 428.93 B: no we discussed as a family that you know you learn um let's just automatically make somebody outside of the state 

429.22 430.81 B: a call point 

430.68 431.77 A: mhm 

431.20 445.56 B: so if something happens in new york again we'll make me the call point god forbid if anything happened here everybody will call my brother in new york because we were really afraid that day that something was gonna happen here only because of all the military bases 

435.00 436.07 A: (( i see )) 

444.57 446.45 A: (( mhm oh okay )) 

446.20 449.85 B: yeah we're you know they kept saying that those could be a target 

449.08 450.13 A: mhm 

450.02 452.62 B: so we were we were really concerned 

453.23 459.88 B: but um as far as not flying and things like that no [noise] we're not 

459.86 460.85 A: mhm 

460.25 464.65 B: we haven't stockpiled water and duct tape and any of that stuff [laughter] 

463.14 467.45 A: that's what i wanted to know if you were gonna you know do any survival things 

467.46 469.74 B: no no what about you 

469.43 479.80 A: [noise] no we really haven't we think about it and we might buy a little bit more food and then say oh well maybe we'd better put you know this in the cupboard 

479.92 481.76 A: (( [laughter] you know for )) 

480.45 481.70 B: mhm 

481.92 484.00 A: and that's about it that's 

484.12 489.83 A: and um and we've talked about it what what are we going to do if the water shuts off or 

490.02 492.17 A: you know things like that we 

491.40 492.50 B: mhm 

492.44 497.05 A: it's probably more in a talking stage than actually 

497.23 498.13 A: um 

498.59 502.04 A: really you know stockpiling things to do 

501.82 502.97 B: right 

502.77 503.92 A: (( and um )) 

503.07 504.07 B: right 

504.13 504.95 B: well 

504.18 506.73 A: my husband has a fatalistic thing 

506.74 512.94 A: if an atomic bomb um drops hey we don't need to worry about anything we're gone [laughter] 

512.21 513.30 B: yeah 

513.03 513.84 A: so 

513.44 519.35 B: yeah well my daughter will be ten in two weeks and we're try we don't want to make her all paranoid 

519.26 520.60 A: oh yeah 

520.00 522.31 B: so you know we 

522.32 527.51 B: we watch the news and we try and be aware but without tr- making her 

527.50 537.84 B: nervous and upset because the whole world trade center really affected her too we were supposed to go there that christmas and take her up in there we had it all planned and everything 

529.01 530.13 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

533.18 534.16 A: oh 

537.67 539.80 A: (( oh my goodness sake )) 

539.00 549.57 B: because we go to new york a lot my family's there and all she knows is that her uncle joey and aunt beth work in the city and she always associated the world trade center with the city 

540.97 542.19 A: mhm 

549.20 550.36 A: mhm 

549.94 556.33 B: so i had to be really careful about you know explaining it to her and how much news we watched and everything 

554.91 555.48 A: (( [noise] )) 

556.31 564.08 A: do you do some explaining to her though that that there re- really is not that much to con- 

564.10 566.54 A: you know worry and 

565.89 567.20 B: oh yeah 

566.70 569.75 A: about the war and why the war or something like 

569.20 572.53 B: and she asks questions she's just that's her she's 

572.60 583.71 B: i don't want to brag but she is very intelligent and so she does ask questions but as long as she understands she's like it's just over there right that it's not going to be here she's okay with it 

581.09 581.79 A: (( that )) 

583.26 584.84 A: uh-huh okay 

584.56 586.18 B: we just don't want her 

585.29 590.97 A: i just wondered because that might be uppermost in my mind because i have a granddaughter 

590.82 592.31 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

591.21 592.83 A: and who's uh 

593.04 595.02 A: who's seven and uh 

595.05 596.94 A: so that's why i'm thinking 

597.11 599.06 A: um you know
