0.00 1.33 A: hello 

0.84 2.03 B: hello 

1.99 3.96 A: hi my name is kathy 

3.72 4.98 B: i'm melody 

4.64 6.89 A: i'm glad to meet you i'm from iowa 

6.63 8.06 B: i'm from oregon 

7.77 11.12 A: oh my goodness the second one from oregon i had oregon last night 

10.58 12.17 B: oh wow [laughter] 

11.39 15.77 A: [laughter] so how do you feel about the middle east [laughter] 

14.92 18.55 B: [sigh] well i think it's like a pot just waiting to boil over 

17.95 20.12 A: i think you probably got that one right 

19.49 26.96 B: [laughter] ah yeah it's pretty scary it's a tense situation and there's a lot of issues at hand 

27.12 28.57 A: yeah um 

28.67 35.35 A: i al- i do feel though that since we've gone over there you know killed so many people and lost so many of the people 

35.50 41.46 A: that we can't do what we did last time and walk out before things are at least you know calmed down over there 

41.07 42.26 B: yeah 

41.61 46.74 A: because if we walk back out on it you know they're saying he's still walking around somewhere or hiding 

46.77 52.35 A: he'll come right back and do it all over again you know and then they'll never s- i mean they don't think well of us anyway 

48.65 49.98 B: oh sure he will [sigh] 

52.52 64.01 A: so i you know i don't think that we should leave yet but [cough] i definitely hope that what the united states is saying or what excuse me the government is saying is really the truth you know that they 

64.14 69.37 A: aren't there because of the oil and they're there to free the people and that's a- all they're going to be there for 

69.22 70.32 B: yeah 

69.93 73.61 A: [cough] but as far as peace in the middle east 

73.97 76.00 A: [sigh] that's never going to be 

76.58 78.48 A: in my opinion because 

78.49 83.92 A: um the bible says it's not going to be until it's over [laughter] you know 

82.72 84.93 B: yeah you're right you're right 

84.11 98.48 A: it's it's not gonna be and it's you know it's the i- israel is the site of everything and it's the cause of everything and it's going to be that way until uh you know until the lord comes back and [sigh] we get rid of all the rest of 'em [laughter] 

97.68 99.28 B: [laughter] 

98.64 102.71 A: i guess that's the best way to put it without going into a great deal of detail [laughter] 

102.00 105.51 B: yeah but i know what you're talking about i i read the good book too so 

104.88 106.38 A: yeah 

106.05 110.06 B: [sigh] yeah ah it's ah real real interesting to me 

109.69 115.78 A: well it's yeah it's just been really strange compared to last time i'm just i'm so glad that they 

115.93 124.78 A: finally toppled him this time you know i was so disappointed when [cough] the other bush was in and you know they were going to go in and hit him with the special forces 

124.79 134.57 A: and then they goofed up or something happened i don't know what it was and and they just never went back in you know and then he was just twice the tyrant as he was before i i just don't understand 

134.97 138.51 A: [sigh] sometimes i think that it would be better if a woman was running things 

138.17 140.29 B: [laughter] 

138.83 143.56 A: [laughter] i hate to say that but you know well we get things done we don't you know 

140.43 141.80 B: (( [laughter] )) 

143.43 144.47 B: yeah 

143.59 156.68 A: i mean it's like o- okay so it's politics big deal let's get down to what this really means but guys can't do that for some reason they just can't do [laughter] you know i'm a democrat and i'm not going to pay any attention to you because you're a republican you know 

148.52 149.41 B: yeah 

156.11 157.43 B: (( [sigh] )) 

156.65 159.85 A: i mean i just think all that stuff is just so stupid 

159.26 160.95 B: [laughter] yeah it is 

159.92 163.19 A: they're going to get a big kick out of this conversation i'm telling you 

162.82 164.13 B: [laughter] 

163.29 165.90 A: this must be why they call me back so much 

165.27 176.22 B: [sigh] yeah go ahead and make it [laughter] yeah um i i think that they really need to take care of the issues this time and you know uh don't let him get away with anything more 

175.87 177.48 A: do you think he's alive 

177.49 180.58 B: i think he might be according to what they been saying 

180.13 192.26 A: yeah that's what i was kind of wondering now because you know at first i mean and it it still could be that you know i mean he could be with o- with osama bin laden maybe they're both in in syria [laughter] 

191.81 193.44 B: it could be or 

192.43 195.69 A: and so are the chemical weapons [laughter] 

194.43 204.42 B: yeah well you know they said some of the upper uh people in the re- his regime have escaped to other countries besides syria you know like maybe france or god knows where 

202.86 205.28 A: uh germany [laughter] 

204.64 207.09 B: germany i was just going to say that yeah 

206.04 209.26 A: but i'm so sorry said the chancellor 

209.30 218.98 A: i didn't want to offend the united states it's amazing how everything changed once we wiped the place out you know it's like [laughter] their whole attitude changed now it's just like 

214.58 215.85 B: yeah 

216.03 217.19 B: yeah 

218.90 227.25 A: how could you be so ignorant [laughter] i mean that's just so i just think that's so oh [lipsmack] they just make no sense [laughter] 

222.89 224.06 B: [laughter] 

224.22 225.04 B: (( ah )) 

226.50 229.83 B: w- what do you think about france's role in all this 

229.80 233.36 A: well you know what when you look back at france's history 

233.47 235.96 A: france has been a wuss forever 

235.80 236.80 B: yeah 

236.20 245.98 A: they've always you know stood on the right on the fence and and they never would jump one way or the other and uh you know as far as i'm concerned [cough] 

246.20 258.17 A: things aren't gray they're black and white and you're either the good guys or you're the bad guys regardless of what it is and if you're going to stay on the fence as far as i'm concerned that's pretty gutless you know 

248.78 249.77 B: yeah 

253.70 254.62 B: yeah [sigh] 

257.50 263.07 B: well you know i've studied uh some of france's conquests in indochina and other countries 

262.63 263.54 A: (( have you )) 

263.30 267.91 B: yeah and it seems like they ah go in for the resources mostly 

267.74 282.13 A: well and see that's what they were that's what they're blaming us for well i wonder why they might think that 'course 'course george junior does own a gas company but [laughter] i mean a oil company which is rather ironic but [laughter] you know 

271.68 272.46 B: (( yeah )) 

273.06 275.48 B: yeah well [sigh] [laughter] 

277.23 278.38 B: [laughter] 

280.56 287.24 B: yeah well i heard scuttle but yes and no against it i don't know i have no opinion 'cause i don't know 

286.05 293.04 A: well i guess we'll have to wait and see on that i would certainly hope not because as much as a christian as he appears to be 

288.23 289.88 B: yeah yeah 

293.10 295.20 A: you know if if he 

295.47 299.22 A: if he g- shows those kind of colors to people 

299.53 303.06 A: he's going to go down as bad if not worse than clinton did you know 

302.66 303.99 B: oh yeah 

303.40 311.32 A: um i- i- for different reasons of course but you know i- i- i mean talk about being ashamed [laughter] i would just 

309.85 316.23 B: oh he'd have a lot to a lot to answer for if if he doesn't back up what he said you know or he he or if if he's just 

314.31 324.06 A: oh no kidding i mean i i i hope that he is what he is because i i know his you know when i studied um i was really studying the new age when george senior was in 

317.73 318.90 B: yeah 

324.09 327.94 A: a- and found out that he was skull and crossbones and all that stuff and i really 

328.03 341.20 A: didn't like him very well [laughter] i mean i just he had you know much of much of a new age attitude as far as i was concerned but i i really don't feel his son does but you know if i i- if i ever find out i'm going to be really upset 

341.44 350.73 A: [laughter] i hate you know but i've made mistakes before i'm really good at like i guess maybe sometimes i'm gullible i always want to think the best about everybody you know 

341.72 342.95 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

350.20 352.88 B: well that's the w- good old american way 

352.30 357.28 A: yeah i guess i don't know how far that gets us in all those other countries though [laughter] 

355.42 362.90 B: [laughter] well you know these people in the middle east they're they have always fought bitterly amongst themselves and the faction 

361.85 375.61 A: well it's holy wars i mean and if you die if you die or kill somebody i- it's it's kind of like if you're a christian and you get crowned you know a- when you go to heaven it's the same thing in in their religion only it's because you killed 

363.21 364.16 B: yeah 

375.63 386.17 A: somebody or [laughter] you know or you or you destroy something or whatever you know and and if you stop and look outside of that you're looking at the good side and the bad side right there 

375.96 378.06 B: mhm yeah yeah 

385.73 392.93 B: uh-huh but but it's been their tradition just to kill each other you know how family members cousins you name it 

386.24 387.10 A: you know 

389.68 390.86 A: oh yeah 

391.23 395.40 A: well and what does that what does that say i don't remember it's in john where it says um 

395.42 403.54 A: no it's not either it's in revelation no it's john ah i don't know anyway [laughter] where it says brother kills br- brother and brother kills brother 

399.53 400.62 B: [laughter] 

403.15 404.01 B: uh-huh 

403.97 417.81 A: and [mn] that i mean that 'cause they're all brothers that's what's so sad about it and they can't figure out that israel was given all that land and it isn't theirs anyway [laughter] i think it's just ah it's too bad [laughter] 

406.84 407.63 B: yeah 

408.26 409.19 B: yeah 

413.54 414.76 B: [laughter] 

417.01 418.56 B: [laughter] 

417.68 422.40 A: you know if they'd just listen to me i could make it so much easier for everybody 

419.71 424.22 B: [laughter] you'd make a make a good president [laughter] 

423.02 430.70 A: [laughter] well i think so i think i could you know i think i could y- if people would listen they'd probably just laugh you know [laughter] like we do 

425.40 426.20 B: [laughter] 

429.28 432.42 B: yeah [laughter] [laughter] 

430.74 433.53 A: and they'd go oh lady it's not this easy 

433.23 435.99 B: yeah well it's all male dominated so 

435.67 438.98 A: that's right that's right i think that's the problem 

436.37 437.67 B: [laughter] 

438.67 441.46 B: oh i'm sure that's a lot of it but [sigh] 

440.42 449.09 A: but i there was a [sigh] on on the news here tonight there was a girl that lives in molleen which is about thirty five miles from here [sigh] and um 

449.25 456.40 A: [lipsmack] she was um in baghdad b- baghdad baghdad that's where she lived and she moved here sixteen years ago 

454.27 454.95 B: (( mm )) 

456.49 461.00 A: and they were interviewing her and she wants to go back and teach the women there 

460.99 463.75 A: how women live in a democracy 

463.42 464.83 B: that would be nice 

463.72 476.18 A: which w- yeah i thought that was real admirable of her you know to come here and get a education and then [sigh] um you know she of course started crying when she said you know she hated to see baghdad completely torn apart like it is but 

466.52 467.52 B: yeah 

475.08 476.34 B: oh it 

476.10 479.05 A: there wasn't any other way to get rid of him if we did 

478.50 485.63 B: yeah you know i was watching c._n._n. and they showed uh baghdad before they people came in and blew it u- it looked like a beautiful city 

485.51 487.94 A: well the part where saddam is anyway 

487.51 491.49 B: yeah yeah i don't know very much about it but it looked like a pretty place 

488.16 490.14 A: [laughter] 

490.66 504.12 A: oh yeah it looks like florida or something you know or cuba 'course that's what he's got when he's smoking those cigars i was thinking that tonight they showed him on t._v. and i thought uh-huh i bet you castro sent you those you guys are all good buddies 

492.80 493.88 B: yeah 

494.20 495.08 B: yeah 

496.24 497.76 B: [laughter] 

501.19 502.48 B: probably 

504.83 506.73 B: [laughter] yeah 

505.64 518.70 A: i just i just think it would be so neat you know since they [sigh] they got the well one son in law that came back with his bodyguard from syria i think it'd be so cool if we scared syria enough because you know what 

518.72 526.88 A: if if they really are there and we leave all of our troops leave and they all run right back over 

527.10 530.11 A: i i'm going to really be upset [laughter] 

528.87 530.91 B: well of course they'll come home 

530.57 541.86 A: unless they're going to like you know get in a big fight with him and then go in there too but then they're going to have to go into jordan and they'll have to go oh palestine and i mean and you know what it'll be then 

535.14 536.11 B: yeah 

541.53 546.91 B: yeah well i guess i guess israel had uh weapons on the ready you know in case uh 

541.92 543.20 A: it'll be a mess

557.02 558.22 B: wow 

557.93 563.14 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] so you know but they told them to keep their nose clean and stay out of iraq so 

563.31 567.23 A: they got to keep theirselves busy with palestine i guess 

564.59 565.38 B: well 

566.71 571.09 B: yeah well i know that israel is scared you know for with good reason 

569.84 575.18 A: well how could they not be but you know what they are the num- you know other than us they're they're the number two force
