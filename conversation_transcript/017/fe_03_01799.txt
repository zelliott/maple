0.30 5.02 A: hi my name's cricket i'm from southern california how you doing today 

4.44 7.26 B: good good my name is tina i'm from new york 

6.89 8.24 A: hi tina 

7.79 8.82 B: how you doing 

8.46 12.25 A: good so i guess we're gonna talk about computers in the school system huh 

11.76 15.19 B: right right so what is your opinion about it 

12.79 14.24 A: (( well ah )) 

14.59 19.60 A: well first of all um i'm gonna give you a just a little quick history here um i 

18.96 19.88 B: mhm 

19.46 29.65 A: got in trouble one time and ah ended up in prison and i was in ah the computer refurbishing department is what's called and what we did is we 

22.32 23.34 B: really 

26.66 27.84 B: oh man 

29.48 30.19 B: (( mm )) 

29.56 34.57 A: rebuilt and built computers for the california um grammar schools 

34.13 35.62 B: oh okay 

34.70 42.86 A: so i mean that was really important and i thought that was um you know a really neat thing that we were doing because i think the computers in the schools nowadays is an extremely 

42.73 50.50 A: ah important aspect for our kids growing up ah you know in the millennium and everything i mean everything's computer related nowadays 

47.98 48.76 B: right 

50.07 61.58 B: well it is i think it is but you know what it is at my my ah from what i've seen from my um nephews and other kids i think it does hamper their education a little bit because i've noticed that um 

56.93 57.68 A: uh-huh 

61.65 72.24 B: i've started to my nephew from when he was like three years old and he loved the computers to a point you know where you know he just wants to get on the computer all the time doesn't want to read 

66.65 67.39 A: uh-huh 

72.15 73.03 A: right 

72.38 75.40 B: he has this problem of ah you know um 

75.66 81.48 B: not wanting to concentrate and i think his concentration has to do you know is getting out of focus from 

81.20 82.74 A: right well 

81.81 85.41 B: it depends on how you use it basically the computers because 

83.62 88.82 A: right i was gonna say 'cause it it depends on ah what they're doing on the computer because um 

87.15 97.69 B: right but then then everything is they want everything computerized it's like they want they go to schools and they don't even want to listen to the teachers they'd rather listen to a computer talking rather than a teacher believe it or not [laughter] you 

96.99 107.25 A: right right well it depends if they're using a computer with or without the internet now if they're on the internet the information ah highway is so extensive i mean 

97.91 98.64 B: know 

101.24 102.09 B: right 

104.00 111.27 B: oh yes is is bad well yeah they don't they don't go on there no they don't go on there unless they do they go on to the you know the 

111.33 114.69 B: cute sites like blue's clues you know and cartoon network 

114.09 116.74 A: right right well okay i suppose 

114.69 127.84 B: but still you know what it is i think it's it does i don't know it's somehow hampers them i mean at a after a certain age i think in their teens they could probably do you know like in schools i'm sure they they do teach them the basics of computers 

127.94 132.97 B: but now they're they're learning them even at three years old that's what i'm wondering and it's sort a like 

133.07 136.95 B: i think it doesn't really improve their their computer skills you know 

136.63 137.56 A: okay 

137.23 144.72 B: over over the long run they won't be concentrating on other parts like you know they have to learn other other studies like study english 

142.49 146.45 A: right right like reading writing math all the basics and stuff 

144.97 149.87 B: yeah they yeah most kids today you know they've been diagnosed for a._d._h._d. 

149.41 150.55 A: right right 

149.94 152.47 B: and i think partly is because 

152.41 166.62 B: even though i'm against that with the teachers basically because they're not really helping them either [laughter] i can't say it's all you know they should be all diagnosed like that and it's correct you know but i just feel that um the computers do play a role in how they're thinking 

154.98 155.82 A: right 

156.93 158.10 A: right 

161.46 162.57 A: right right 

166.82 173.14 B: you know and the future is and how it how their whole frame of work is but the whole the teachers have to do their part 

168.03 169.15 A: right 

172.78 179.80 A: right well um okay well my opinion ah of the computers though being in the school system it um 

178.42 179.28 B: right 

180.03 184.54 A: our technology like i was saying everything is computer orientated 

183.29 184.11 B: right 

184.35 197.67 A: you know and a lot of us like i'm forty six years old and i had no idea anything about computers growing up because they weren't there but now that i do um and i do know a lot about computers i still feel kinda computer illiterate 

185.65 187.04 B: eventually will mhm 

189.62 190.30 B: right 

197.48 209.68 A: you go out and go to get a job anywhere whether you're gonna be at mcdonald's on their little touch screen things or i mean even to work the a._t._m. machines or anything they need to know how to 

198.60 199.41 B: (( mhm )) 

201.03 202.26 B: (( mhm yeah yeah right )) 

205.93 207.32 B: (( probably maybe 'cause )) 

209.58 214.68 A: function the functions of a computer um 'cause that's just the way everything is anymore 

212.08 212.99 B: (( right right )) 

213.74 217.83 B: but i think you probably do know computers it's just that you know 

217.89 223.08 B: you know it's pretty you know once you learn them and get into them you pretty much 

220.35 221.25 A: right 

223.18 233.10 B: you know i've pretty well i've worked well with computers i've built them and everything and i know how you know just about everything how it runs and everything it's just that um 

226.63 228.04 A: right right 

233.22 245.90 B: you know okay that's like getting into the whole repair part but ah it is it is an opportunity it's just that a lot of people there's gonna be a lot of competition out there because you gotta know it it's part of mandatory thing after a while it'll become mandatory 

240.94 242.15 A: right 

244.25 247.59 A: right well you know on the in the hardware issue but on the 

246.58 254.08 B: it is good it is good that you know all our but as an education at the beginning especially from let's say 

254.13 261.62 B: elementary school i would not introduce computers to the kids 'til after they get into junior high school or high school 

261.49 263.27 A: (( really okay well i think )) 

262.44 266.81 B: yeah i wouldn't introduce them that early because i i feel that they're not really um 

264.03 264.92 A: okay 

267.20 278.50 B: focusing on other parts of the studies that they feel that 'cause they consider it as a game basically a computer becomes a game to them they put in the software and they can play you know 

268.31 269.21 A: okay 

275.47 276.70 A: right okay 

278.65 280.79 B: and just like video games are 

280.08 285.10 A: (( right well okay back on the thing you said that you know a lot of our kids are attention deficit )) 

284.78 285.99 B: (( right mm )) 

285.23 288.02 A: by having computers there for them 

287.92 292.71 A: it um to me would expand their interest because i mean you can do 

292.57 307.39 A: learning things on computers that are fun that would keep their interest going for them and than to let them run wild in the classroom and learn absolutely nothing at least ah through a computer or a computer a good program you know kids' programs um 

293.64 294.42 B: (( still )) 

295.20 297.64 B: (( oh yeah their interest yes )) 

298.07 298.84 B: right 

302.08 302.86 B: right 

306.63 313.58 B: sure they could incorporate let's say the computer in there with the teaching and somehow you know teach it that way 

310.55 315.66 A: right right incorporated but not to just to just leave it out like you know you were saying i don't think that's good 

314.11 327.77 B: that they could do but they haven't really done that yet in like elementary they have pretty much they're sticking with the basics the books and everything you know they have to buy the text book the math books and all this and they're not focusing really on you know 

319.33 320.50 A: right right 

327.77 334.53 B: you know if they did that then maybe they you know they could improve you know in a different way maybe we could look at it as a you know we could then 

330.57 332.09 A: right well um 

334.64 337.11 B: give our judgment as to if it's good or not 

336.54 342.13 A: right on the other hand though they're learning things like ah typing which teaches them the alphabet 

339.97 340.75 B: right 

341.80 342.78 B: mhm 

342.16 346.81 A: um things like that punctuation um you know um 

344.71 345.68 B: true 

345.90 353.10 B: typing for typing speed especially men and women today even men have to you know type fast basically women 

353.14 356.88 B: you know what i'm saying it does speed up your your coordination and your eye 

355.76 363.33 A: right so so oh good there's a good one their coordination so if the children are learning to do this in schools at a young age i mean 

358.90 359.91 B: yeah 

360.93 370.92 B: i think it is to a certain point though to bring it to school but then again i don't know how they would incorporate it in in elementary school when they start you know if they do ever bring it to 

371.08 372.15 B: you know to 

372.19 373.67 B: to elementary 

373.11 375.61 A: oh they do have them i mean in california we have them in 

374.96 376.44 B: oh you guys have them 

375.90 384.80 A: we have them in all the schools almost and like i said okay the project that i was in that's what we did is we built the computers for elementary schools 

376.86 380.68 B: oh in new york they don't though in new york yeah do 

383.44 385.81 B: you teach do you teach them too do 

385.21 386.28 A: excuse me 

385.90 387.35 B: you teach also 

386.99 388.60 A: do i teach no 

387.73 389.01 B: (( yeah oh okay mhm )) 

388.81 393.03 A: no i'm not i'm not a teacher um actually i'm a printer technician 

390.68 391.63 B: mhm 

392.75 393.58 B: mhm 

392.89 404.41 A: um but ah as for i mean i think it's wonderful that the kids have these things in the in their schools and i think it's almost um not i don't like to use the word mandatory but ah 

398.90 399.72 B: mhm 

404.32 408.89 A: like you said ah it teaches them motor skills it ah um 

405.14 407.50 B: well it's gonna be after a while yeah 

408.46 410.26 B: motor skills wise yeah 

409.66 420.60 A: yeah and i mean and that's important um you know as long as they're not sitting there just playing games or something which a lot of ah the kids that's what ends up happening is they just want to sit there and play games and games 

412.13 412.92 B: right 

420.28 421.26 B: right 

420.61 422.77 A: but if you were in the school system 

421.57 429.55 B: how how is the education system in in um california a lot of them do are a lot of them diagnosed with a._d._h._d. 

428.99 434.54 A: um i think kids everywhere are [laughter] um i i know a lot of kids that way 

431.66 432.46 B: yeah 

433.23 440.07 B: but you know what it is it's become more ah you know like now there's a name for it you know basically in the past there wasn't you know 

437.59 439.68 A: right right yeah right 

439.99 446.69 A: i think ah you know everybody's that way or it's just that the generation's the way that they were raised and you know um 

440.08 440.97 B: and 

443.03 443.94 B: mhm 

446.57 458.19 A: like i said i'm forty six so i was raised under a strict hand but then when i raised my children it was you know a lot lighter and they're raising their children and now you can't spank them or do anything you know type thing and so 

452.50 453.93 B: oh you have your own kids 

454.43 455.84 B: i would think you know 

457.29 464.43 B: the only thing is they're good they pick up they learn and everything but afterwards you know i do find that my ne- well my see my nephew 

460.39 461.42 A: right 

464.38 475.92 B: he he always everything he does basically video games to t._v. to um computers they get bored afterwards and i do find them just like you know what do i do next you know 

471.88 472.68 A: right 

475.14 479.94 A: right right and that's because there's so many opportunities there's so many different things to do 

476.43 477.94 B: he's told me that so many 

478.25 486.53 B: times it is but apparently they don't see it that way they like come to a run point where their mind doesn't seem to say well there's so many things to do you know 

481.05 481.96 A: right 

485.66 491.15 A: and when we were young there wasn't hardly anything to do and we weren't bored we were always out finding something to do 

487.38 488.80 B: (( yeah well we had our )) 

489.67 492.22 B: oh i think we had more fun during out age 

491.66 494.54 A: [laughter] i do too but um 

492.95 504.99 B: [laughter] because i think we were we were into like well girls were into their playhouse dolls and to their activities outside they were more outdoors we were more outdoors you know than than the kids today 

500.18 500.98 A: right 

501.17 502.10 A: right 

502.44 504.48 A: right okay um 

504.52 517.15 A: well kinda back to the schools and and the computer thing here um the downfall side would be is that there doesn't seem to be enough money for budgeting to pay our teachers and and security on the schools or whatever 

507.63 508.79 B: mhm 

514.29 515.10 B: right 

516.94 530.28 A: you know that they need here in california um the school system ah supplies their school supplies like their paper and pencil and stuff like that parents don't have to buy their little their kids their little pack to start school with um that 

529.55 532.53 B: do they have that in california they supply that oh okay 

530.65 534.63 A: yes that's that's incorporated um it's part of the state 

532.96 544.26 B: oh well we don't have that here actually we they should you know what it is now here we don't have that much funding in new york city with the education that's why people are complaining once we got a republican into office 

541.95 543.05 A: right 

544.13 549.18 B: a lot of a lot of ah [laughter] a lot of things go a little bit crazy around um yep 

546.20 547.14 A: right 

547.98 557.75 A: well they're getting ready to lay off four hundred administrative positions just here in the san diego school district right now because they don't have enough money you know which 

555.73 556.80 B: (( really oh )) 

556.90 560.01 B: they shouldn't spend the supplies you know i think they should let the 

560.24 566.26 B: the parents pay for certain things not the computers i'm saying but you know the supplies pencils and pens and paper 

563.87 565.15 A: right right 

565.93 567.51 A: well yeah 

566.30 580.27 B: but you know i guess you know they do supply you're right some books that i've seen in school from my nephew's 'cause i don't have my own kids but i my nephews they do supply them those things which is good like you said but it will save paper if you have a computer you know 

572.56 573.61 A: right 

578.52 579.12 A: (( bu- )) 

579.38 589.89 A: i was gonna say yeah if if they had computers you know what ah they're not going to have to pay for books and things like that and every year have to buy things it's it's right 

580.24 581.59 B: obviously yeah 

584.51 585.34 B: right 

587.05 592.44 B: and there'll be more jobs yeah and there'll be more jobs for people like us you know looking into computers you know 

590.46 591.40 A: right 

592.37 593.38 A: (( right oh )) 

592.46 599.95 B: i would think ah you know because people would you know at schools they would somehow break down once in a while and you know networking is required and 

597.81 598.90 A: of course
