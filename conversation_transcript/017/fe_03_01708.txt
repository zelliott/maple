15.64 16.86 B: well you first 

16.75 24.25 A: ah well i've been wondering what's going on over there in korea compared to what we've got going already in 

20.54 21.48 B: uh-huh 

24.33 26.52 A: you know with saddam hussein 

27.02 29.38 A: and kinda wondering what's next 

29.26 30.13 B: uh-huh 

29.76 32.24 A: 'cause they're saying that that 

32.33 34.93 A: we're not gonna let that happen to us 

34.95 36.36 A: korea is 

36.96 39.95 B: yeah well you know it's a case of um 

40.26 46.21 B: um desperation i think on their part they're looking for food for money for help to prop up a 

46.33 53.03 B: system that hasn't been working very well at all um not that it's communist or anything else just so much as a 

53.11 55.71 B: a dictatorship where people don't 

55.78 59.13 B: you know perform if they're just told what to do um 

59.46 63.02 B: so i'm sort of yeah they're a threat but um 

63.27 69.36 B: i would of done the same thing for them as i would of done for iraq which is to just wait until the regime's changed 

69.80 71.34 A: until the what is 

70.72 72.59 B: (( the regime's changed i )) 

72.16 73.20 A: yeah 

72.81 75.48 B: mean saddam wouldn't of lived forever he was no 

75.73 85.66 B: fundamental threat to us particularly any more than russia or pakistan with nuclear weapons and heavily islamic fundamentalists could be next week if 

85.74 88.21 B: the present government changes um 

88.75 92.95 B: i mean we lived with russia for what seventy eighty years and still they have 

93.07 98.21 B: weapons of mass destruction which are totally dangerous to us and they're not necessarily that friendly 

98.33 101.23 B: (( [sigh] )) 

98.94 100.89 A: right that's true too 

101.54 102.52 B: anyway 

103.30 106.34 B: it's a pity to kill people just to save people 

106.86 115.51 A: yeah and then bringing it to light on the news it's you can't avoid it it's there it's happening and you're wondering 

115.53 117.32 A: how the individuals 

117.44 118.65 A: think of it 

118.70 119.60 A: um 

119.67 122.32 A: but the more of a threat 

122.77 123.91 A: is 

124.06 128.00 A: in not one company well looking at osaman osaman 

128.23 130.24 A: bin laden or whatever his name is 

129.05 131.27 B: yeah osama yeah 

130.69 133.07 A: you know his his current 

133.15 135.73 A: threat of nine one one of course 

136.40 141.63 A: who else has the capability of putting them plans together that should we be looking at 

142.67 144.82 B: well i think there are lots of 

145.71 148.71 B: um components to ah 

149.00 152.56 B: you know the al qaeda network and there may be other 

152.64 157.18 B: terrorist groups not necessarily connected in fighting them and fighting 

157.21 164.39 B: their way of course it's not a question of invading another country with a huge army and everything else to 

164.58 170.03 B: to ah knock it off it's it's a long slow undercover 

169.66 170.62 A: right 

170.33 175.47 B: you know cloak and dagger operation that you have to pursue and get good with just as some of the 

175.90 181.53 B: other countries have had to do in europe when they've live for you know decades and centuries with 

181.54 188.32 B: hostility we just need to do that trying to take and fix it with a sledgehammer won't get you anywhere 

188.27 191.75 A: right well you seem like a very intelligent person 

191.75 192.64 B: (( well )) 

192.70 194.25 B: i don't know about that but 

193.45 196.58 A: or has kept up with the current issues more than i 

196.79 207.09 A: um but that's what my point was is that i don't think we should have think of a threat from a specific country i think we should be concerned with the little terrorist groups more than 

207.15 209.11 A: a specific country 

208.86 219.40 B: that's right if we have a country that won't let you go at them that's a different matter [mn] you know if it protects them and won't let you get at them but i'm not convinced that um 

219.58 223.33 B: there is any such country that we can infiltrate and deal with 

223.58 224.62 B: however 

225.42 226.53 B: um 

225.54 226.35 A: (( mm ))

235.18 236.41 A: chemical 

237.02 238.66 A: warfare 

237.94 239.02 B: yep 

238.85 242.68 A: that's more of a what i consider a bigger threat 

243.00 244.91 A: than physical force 

243.16 244.31 B: (( yep )) 

244.56 246.30 B: oh yeah no i have a 

246.48 251.14 B: a relative a somewhat older person who is dreadfully worried about 

251.21 260.08 B: somebody bringing in a natural gas tanker into the boston harbour where i live and ah blowing up the city by just blowing up the tanker 

260.34 265.54 B: um there's so much stuff that comes into this country in containers and in every other way 

265.81 270.60 B: you know they could be loaded with all kinds of things from dirty bombs to chemicals to 

270.65 274.11 B: you name it and um we're not doing very much to 

274.32 276.99 B: watch over that at this point

339.91 341.30 A: and you always 

341.87 352.42 A: yeah yeah and you're always concerned about if the if our military was to be retaliated against which one would they choose first 

352.00 353.37 B: mhm 

352.59 354.10 A: you know that type of thing 

353.89 355.37 B: right 

355.69 357.18 A: so but um 

357.80 363.48 B: well you know the interesting thing is that countries like israel of course have been dealing with this for 

363.60 365.68 B: since their beginning um 

364.67 369.25 A: yeah it's in the bible all the way through just another war 

367.59 369.33 B: yep 

369.39 370.64 A: so um but 

371.67 375.26 A: oh still it's sad it has to happen you

377.65 379.29 B: (( yep )) 

379.62 385.02 B: well i guess the bottom line there are a number of countries that are a potential danger to us but um 

385.37 393.80 B: you know if you know that and you take appropriate safeguards in in my view the best thing to do is to sit still and let the age you know the regimes 

393.94 397.25 B: self destruct as they all eventually do um 

397.77 402.30 B: you know i mean saddam in in in iraq couldn't have lasted that much longer [sigh] 

403.31 405.37 A: well you say that why do you say that 

403.36 407.33 B: um he was an older man he was getting old 

407.61 410.74 B: he's got a lot of people looking for his job 

408.53 416.07 A: well he coulda done a yeah but he still could of done a lot of damage in the ten if he lasted another ten years 

416.16 417.96 B: well to whom 

418.77 423.42 A: well if you believe the stories on t._v. which i'm not sure if i do 

421.83 422.99 B: [laughter] 

423.02 424.99 B: mhm 

423.60 427.21 A: but to his own people the harm he was doing to his own people 

426.80 427.81 B: yeah 

427.88 433.63 B: and and and well on the one hand i'm happy they're liberated or think they are for the moment 

433.66 436.47 B: the other side of the coin is people have to 

436.70 444.06 B: you know ah do their own liberating of course the tragedy in that situation is that we did encourage them to do it 

444.13 448.41 B: under the first george bush and when they did we didn't help them one bit 

448.77 452.44 B: instead we let get hun- we let hundreds of thousands of them get killed 

452.96 454.90 B: ah for having tried 

454.31 456.30 A: what's your age may i ask 

456.25 459.81 B: [laughter] oh i'm in in sixties or so 

459.71 467.41 A: you that's why you're so knowledgeable i'm only forty five so yeah [laughter] you 

462.24 463.14 B: well 

464.03 469.76 B: oh you're a kiddo [laughter] i don't think that's particularly why 

467.98 472.24 A: i could learn something from you i could learn something from your living 

472.08 475.59 B: well we could all learn from each other 

472.88 474.30 A: so but 

474.97 483.31 A: yes yes we can you know as my father he wants my son to go in the military he's twenty six 

481.60 484.58 B: mhm mhm 

483.61 484.96 A: (( and i )) 

486.10 487.43 A: i just don't know 

487.25 489.08 B: well it's 

489.10 495.24 B: it's a good profession if he's willing to take on the bad side which is to be you know put at risk 

495.27 501.84 B: from time to time i would rather be in however a military such as our own where normally 

497.08 498.02 A: (( i bet you )) 

501.92 510.91 B: the government is um one that ends wars rather than starts them and um that would that's a position to be proud of 

506.30 507.28 A: correct 

508.12 509.10 A: (( that all )) 

510.31 511.68 A: that leads to 

511.71 514.00 A: politician- ah better politicians 

513.71 514.86 B: yep 

514.94 517.77 A: which i don't think we're going to change in ten minutes

522.01 523.28 B: right 

523.87 527.42 B: too many ah in the south are shifting to ah 

527.70 534.37 B: republican and they're getting people like chaney and rumsfeld and um these other characters 

534.82 541.75 B: who are um i don't think particularly con- you know concerned with anything other than making a lot of money 

540.65 541.59 A: right 

542.06 546.02 B: um i think colin powell's a good guy but i don't think he has 

546.15 548.13 B: any more latitude 

548.22 556.26 A: you know i think this conflict with other countries though is definitely affecting our economy and not for the good
