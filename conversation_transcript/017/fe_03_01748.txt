11.49 16.42 A: [mn] i am in my kitchen making dinner as i am every time i get a call [laughter] 

14.85 21.27 B: you know what i am doing the exact same [noise] thing [noise] isn't it hes [noise] can you hear [noise] my timer going off [laughter] 

17.15 20.47 A: really [laughter] 

20.52 23.49 A: [laughter] oh well there you go 

21.45 22.89 B: [laughter] 

24.01 33.90 A: all right so the question is do we think any ah if i heard it right it kinda bleeped there did did it say do we think that there are any foreign countries that are a threat to the u._s. 

24.03 24.63 B: (( [cough] [mn] )) 

33.27 35.30 B: that that's what i heard too 

35.13 36.13 A: okay 

36.55 43.37 B: [mn] well do you wanna start [mn] i i'll tell you right now ah you know i still think that iraq is a threat 

43.26 51.80 B: um until they have told me for sure they have found saddam hussein i think he's a threat and the same thing with osama bin laden 

49.17 50.22 A: mhm 

51.74 66.37 B: but i also think korea is a threat and unfortunately it's been thrown on the back burner right now and i think syria because they keep you know all the news reports i keep hearing are talking about how they helped smuggle people in and that they might have 

64.82 65.99 A: mhm 

66.20 71.62 B: helped iraq through this whole mess a- and those are the big ones that come to my mind 

72.17 76.07 A: well i would have to agree with you on all those plus more [laughter] 

75.24 77.51 B: yeah which really which ones 

76.58 80.59 A: defin- well for for instance ah china 

80.33 81.86 B: yeah mhm 

80.64 92.32 A: i think china's a major issue um i think that's why korea is an issue is because china's an issue it's a i mean they're such a big block and i think that's sort of like they're they're such a big 

92.23 99.76 A: w- a- c- country that in some ways we're afraid to deal with them head on because they're so volatile and 

99.87 112.98 A: you know there's just [mn] there's all kinds of problems there i'm sure all the horrendous things that we're gonna end up hearing that saddam was doing to his people um that and worse has happened to the people of china 

112.53 113.92 B: [noise] [lipsmack] i think you're right 

112.99 117.32 A: and [mn] you know when you don't have any basic 

117.36 120.11 A: fundamental value of life 

119.99 134.69 A: then i think any com- any one who has that much power and does not have certain values is gonna be a threat to the united states because we do have those values not to say that we're perfect but we have an an an intrinsic value of life 

130.41 131.40 B: right 

134.65 136.58 A: you know whether y- i mean 

136.54 142.52 A: some people will probably argue that issue you know over the pro life issues and certainly there are thin 

142.47 152.06 A: things in our philosophy as a whole that you know sometimes show a little inconsistency but basically in comparison with other civilizations and other times 

151.96 158.05 A: we're we have a value of life and we have a sense of you know ah 

154.71 155.66 B: mhm 

158.90 163.90 A: decency that other countries [sigh] ah their philosophy doesn't have that 

163.53 165.54 B: no they don't they don't 

164.48 166.55 A: and they're always going to hate us 

166.13 167.22 B: mhm 

166.57 175.43 A: and they're they have a lot of mind control i mean the reason that the middle east is such a wreck is because they've been hearing they don't ever get any 

175.63 177.42 A: opposite points of view 

177.24 178.45 B: [noise] [noise] no they don't 

177.49 179.59 A: there's some people that want to pro- 

179.54 188.58 A: pro- propagate a certain ah point of view and so that's why they're so shocked when saddam fell because they really believed everything that the i 

188.41 203.04 A: that they were hearing on al jazeera because they have nothing to compare it to and now [mn] they're in disarray and and they've been so brainwashed to just be against the united states that facts you know don't don't confuse them with facts 

190.47 191.35 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

202.70 204.50 B: that's right that's right 

203.54 211.64 A: they've already got it and and you know that mentality is over in china it's over in korea that guy in korea is a nut 

211.24 213.67 B: (( [mn] yep mhm i agree totally )) 

212.70 215.70 A: you know these people are dying by the millions too 

215.76 227.11 B: [cough] but in in how many of them are induced deaths you know i mean when you've got a population like that and they're they're killing baby girls simply by virtue of their sex 

224.98 225.86 A: yep 

227.04 228.15 A: mhm 

227.61 235.16 B: so no i totally agree with you and i think the other thing is is like exactly like you said that you have so many people 

228.33 229.27 A: mhm 

235.49 243.82 B: in these countries that are not getting the facts and unfortunately they're being you know they're being force fed 

237.09 238.22 A: [noise] 

239.01 240.08 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

243.86 256.67 B: this religion dogma and i mean i'm not knocking religion but there's a big difference between religion and spirituality and they what what you see in a lot of these countries is is this organized business religion 

250.49 252.58 A: mhm mhm 

256.64 265.81 B: and and people that are living in abject poverty where they have nothing else to live for and so to die for a cause is glorious 

259.38 260.31 A: right 

262.81 264.15 A: right 

265.39 267.65 A: right right 

266.02 274.87 B: and and when you when i see those little children on the television especially in iraq my heart just breaks for them because they never have a chance b 

272.00 273.21 A: mhm 

274.51 284.49 A: no i mean [mn] the fact they were letting what a hundred and ten hundred and thirty ah kids under [noise] the age of twelve [noise] between the ages of six and twelve were were released from prison 

284.27 285.38 B: (( isn't that )) 

284.67 287.91 A: (( what were they doing in prison [laughter] you know [sigh] )) 

285.81 287.06 B: exactly 

287.26 293.97 B: what could they poss- i mean you know here time out is a big deal but you know [laughter] at that age to end up in prison 

289.37 290.00 A: (( [mn] )) 

291.20 292.40 A: yeah 

293.48 306.93 A: right well it's just fear i mean that's why they have i mean it just blows my mind how many ah saddam statues and paintings and so that he gave them this feeling that he was watching and hearing every single thing they did 

294.11 295.03 B: you know 

306.39 307.30 B: oh yeah 

306.80 308.89 A: his picture was everywhere [mn] 

308.17 312.49 B: [mn] oh yeah it was just a like you said psychological manipulation 

311.66 314.60 A: exactly and now they're in disarray 

312.66 313.42 B: and 

314.17 315.75 B: absolute disarray mhm 

314.99 328.48 A: you know and i understand that i understand why they hate us because they have never seen anything redeeming they've been told all these terrible things about not just us but the whole western world the whole western so called philosophy 

321.93 323.00 B: that's right 

328.03 329.14 B: (( that's right mhm mhm )) 

328.32 330.20 A: i mean they're they're just 

330.30 336.59 A: really filled with that for all these generations and it doesn't take too many generations to really steal away the hearts of 

336.76 343.73 A: of a country and that's pretty much you know what's happened it seems to me so i mean i think any other countries 

344.36 347.05 A: that don't have a certain level of freedom 

347.29 349.70 A: are threats to the united states 

349.27 349.95 B: (( yeah i )) 

349.80 358.78 A: i mean russia was a threat before i don't think they're so much of a threat but they could be if they keep lining up with with china ah you know 

358.74 360.12 B: mhm 

359.39 364.65 A: [mn] i mean we're just vulnerable we're at the top of the heap and that's you know everybody would like to shoot us off 

364.07 374.85 B: that's right that's right and you know unfortunately the very freedom that we covet and we would love to share with the rest of the world are the things that make us very vulnerable 

365.12 366.37 A: so [noise] i 

374.29 381.18 A: know it's so crazy i [mn] it it to us it just seems so ridiculous [noise] that people would be against [noise] freedom you know 

380.79 382.75 B: (( mhm absolutely )) 

381.61 394.76 A: but my understanding is [noise] france is the word [noise] democracy which when we think of democracy we really mean a representative [noise] from it but [noise] in i i guess in ah the [noise] islamic 

385.69 386.58 B: mhm 

394.68 402.95 A: ah language [noise] the word democracy doesn't translate well so it's sort of like anti god independent of god 

399.31 400.17 B: right 

402.59 404.18 B: (( right right mhm yep )) 

403.25 412.14 A: or something like that and so of course because they're they're very religiously orientated god orientated um 

404.32 405.29 B: mhm 

412.33 415.87 A: [lipsmack] culture anything like that i mean it's just 

415.84 422.31 A: you know language means so much we know that here in the united states we're a little bit more you know in business and ever- every 

422.15 431.64 A: language has changed a [noise] tremendous amount to change people's perceptions and the language that we're using over there is not really very effective it doesn't seem to me 

431.23 433.82 B: no i i think that's very true 

432.03 442.92 A: we have ah we haven't prepared and we haven't prepared and i think that's another thing is we set ourselves up [mn] to be in this situation in some degree in i- iraq because we didn't prepare 

442.86 451.53 A: enough towards the intra- infrastructure issues that were going to arise as soon as the war was over now obviously that's cause we didn't realize how quick it was going to be 

451.02 455.96 B: [noise] [noise] no that's true but it's still something that we should have anticipated 

452.86 454.18 A: (( but ah )) 

455.38 466.82 A: i know it i i don't understand why it wasn't why is it they're trying to decide now why is it they just decided and sent that guy over there to to head up the reorganization 

466.37 468.10 B: right the the they only thing 

466.97 472.70 A: they should of had that person set up and ready to go before they went to war [noise] 

470.08 471.07 B: (( yeah )) 

471.97 478.15 B: well the only reason i think they they probably didn't and an although i agree with you it should've been done 

478.04 491.64 B: is i'm wondering if if that might have been a fear of how it would have appeared to the rest of the world that not only were we going to storm the country but we you know we've already made plans on how it's going to run and as if they had no say whatsoever 

483.67 486.66 A: (( yeah it could be [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

489.20 497.06 A: [noise] [noise] right [noise] well and that's what they're afraid that they're not going to have any say but frankly they're not educated enough [noise] yo- 

496.87 510.46 A: they can't make educated decisions [noise] if it's left up to them the last i heard [noise] and this is on n._p._r. so i mean it wasn't like on a conservative channel or something and they said that the ir- the um 

498.70 500.13 B: no they don't mhm [noise] 

510.36 518.22 A: [lipsmack] the islamic countries are wanting it i mean the islamic people there they want an ayatollah 

517.86 519.29 B: (( yeah yeah yeah mhm )) 

518.84 532.70 A: that's what they want they want an ayatollah now there's christians you know there's catholics and all kinds of christian religions over there too they want to have some representations there's [noise] two different kinds of islamics over [noise] there 

529.14 530.13 B: right 

532.41 533.31 B: mhm 

532.59 539.97 A: you know so but you know what was interesting as i found out that saddam's part of his philosophy [lipsmack] 

540.29 543.08 A: was to separate all the people groups 

543.14 544.20 B: oh 

543.49 546.83 A: and so he taught them prejudice 

546.51 547.49 B: mhm 

547.44 558.23 A: and so now they have all these really polarized polarized view points of the other or- other kinds of belief systems and other gr- people groups 

547.52 548.41 B: (( a mhm [noise] )) 

558.04 571.30 A: because he made them separate and did not let them get to know each other and did not encourage any intermingling in fact he encouraged a lack of intermingling that they all should live in separate towns and se- separate areas 

570.30 571.84 B: mhm yeah mhm 

571.15 581.28 A: well you know with that with that kind of background and that kind of education how are they going to make a decision that's anywhere towards a representative government 

580.70 588.49 B: that's right that's right and even if they they had any desire to try to break out of those groups how can you do that living in poverty 

588.79 590.09 A: yeah that's true 

588.79 599.89 B: you know that country's you know bi as as big as the state of of california so where on earth are you going to go to get to a town that's half way across the country you'll you'll never get there and you know 

593.58 594.80 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

598.38 599.88 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah ))
