36.97 37.98 A: (( uh-huh right right )) 

38.11 39.08 A: yeah 

38.46 43.57 B: because because of the nuclear program that they said they're developing 

42.68 44.56 A: (( yeah in order )) 

45.12 50.97 B: you think they would use that to possibly threaten or strike united states or its allies 

50.95 56.87 A: (( to get help uh from other countries uh yeah )) 

57.46 63.18 A: (( that could be that could be a )) 

63.22 72.59 A: (( possibility there also um that sounds like a good one too i mean especially if uh you know there be uh especially if their economy you know has been bad and )) 

72.06 74.55 B: right right well 

74.71 78.15 B: there are a lot of countries that have developed nuclear programs without 

78.29 81.96 B: but do you do you feel like north korea has a uh 

82.15 85.90 B: a a a particular motive for threatening the united states 

85.77 100.29 A: (( um they need help or especially with embargoes like you said that could be a good possibility there just to get some you know help or not even that but attention exactly right uh-huh am i aware of it yes oh of course i mean i mean )) 

99.54 101.38 B: mhm 

100.54 101.51 A: uh 

101.84 108.25 A: (( yeah i'm sure that there's a lot of uh countries out )) 

108.46 111.25 A: (( there you know third world countries smaller countries )) 

111.14 112.01 B: mhm 

112.03 113.42 A: (( that )) 

112.83 117.88 B: yeah i mean why else would you develop nuclear weapons if not to defend or 

117.95 120.68 B: (( attack other countries yes i mean )) 

121.12 123.52 B: but uh 

123.67 134.38 B: do you think i'm kind of curious do you think north some people would choose north korea of first of all there's not a who- i mean there is evidence that they've been developing the program 

134.29 135.08 A: (( are )) 

134.49 145.02 B: but some people accused them of uh publicly announcing these these these plans for weapons development as a sort of cry for help 

145.15 159.50 B: in in the sense in the sense that they're sort of disintegrating on the inside it's really falling apart so it's sort of li- uh lashing out and for you know as a means of attention um there has been embargoes on the country for 

145.21 146.09 A: (( like )) 

159.68 161.53 B: for decades um 

160.86 161.90 A: (( for example uh )) 

162.46 163.54 B: also 

163.61 169.67 B: so i mean do you think that that's a possibility that maybe they're not actually planning to use the weapons but more 

169.72 172.60 B: using them as a leveraging tool in order to get 

171.48 172.41 A: (( you know saddam )) 

173.05 176.85 A: (( hussein i'm sure he was telling his people telling his people that you know hey these guys )) 

177.21 184.07 A: (( you know they're a world power and they have active nuclear and also why should w- why shouldn't we to protect ourselves well iraq well what what i would think first to )) 

183.27 184.18 B: yeah 

184.59 197.60 A: (( do is yeah i guess i'm pretty sure that uh uh well you know secretary of state and uh our vice president and all the other people said some stuff or has sent some stuff over to north korea you know and they've )) 

192.50 193.40 B: mhm 

198.16 205.62 B: yeah i mean their citizens are starving because they live under a tyrannical maniacal dictator kind of i mean 

205.70 214.93 B: it is hard to compare without you know really having numbers but almost you know certainly as bad if not worse than the dictator we just removed in iraq 

207.30 208.31 A: (( exch- )) 

214.97 218.09 B: uh are you aware that we have 

218.18 228.87 B: um i'm not sure on the exact numbers but i know a few thousand active military troops still in south korea bordering on uh a demilitarized zone between north and south korea 

229.65 230.91 B: don't you think that that's 

229.65 231.97 A: (( exchanged words about that you )) 

232.08 242.99 B: do you think what do you think about the united states presence in the region don't you feel don't you think that some countries might feel threatened by the fact that the united states still has active military troops there and 

242.90 244.73 A: (( know to either abandon their )) 

243.16 247.58 B: and is it legitimate to try and you know defend yourself in some way 

245.68 246.90 A: (( operations or )) 

247.84 253.71 A: (( i'm sure they've gotten some warnings or what not but if worse comes comes to worst if they keep on manufacturing these uh )) 

253.80 262.33 A: (( nuclear weapons i would i would assume yeah that )) 

256.66 257.38 B: mhm 

262.40 264.22 A: (( i mean nucl- that uh [cough] )) 

264.82 266.18 A: (( that there should be )) 

266.68 267.91 A: (( some military action )) 

267.05 267.82 B: (( so )) 

268.31 269.19 A: (( involved )) 

268.37 269.40 B: (( tell me )) 

269.76 270.78 B: if 

271.56 275.28 B: north korea has exhibited evidence that they do have 

275.41 284.36 B: nuclear weapons and they have some motive whatever that may be to attacking the united states do you think we should do some sort of military intervention maybe 

284.87 288.28 B: you know considering after you know the 

285.08 285.78 A: (( uh )) 

289.25 295.04 B: yeah after iraq after we after it seems that we've we've we've made some success there 

291.42 292.24 A: (( no )) 

295.08 302.86 A: (( well i mean they we uh well i mean i'm sure we would get help from other countries i mean )) 

303.93 305.48 A: (( we we already we )) 

306.06 308.26 A: (( gained some some of the we )) 

308.59 316.81 A: (( kind of w- i'm not saying we won it yet but i'm saying we did a good job here in )) 

310.68 311.56 B: mhm 

316.72 317.62 B: mhm 

317.92 323.46 A: (( the iraqi war doing that with the help of you know some other countries also involved )) 

323.91 331.66 A: (( uh i would think that we'd probably try to get some uh like the u._n. or or nato those countries together )) 

331.85 332.84 A: uh 

332.44 340.40 B: do you do you feel like if the u._s. doesn't do it no-one will is that sort of their deal like we have to now like we are so powerful 

336.99 338.05 A: well 

338.72 340.08 A: (( i well i )) 

340.52 346.40 A: (( think what the u._n. is doing is they're really trying to you know stay neutral with all )) 

347.88 358.41 A: (( this and it really don't want i guess they don't want any problems right now as in world affairs uh as far as weaker they )) 

351.77 352.71 B: mhm 

354.53 355.37 B: mhm 

359.21 366.03 A: (( i mean they are showing signs of weakness you know because i'm you know if they if they weren't weak they would have made some )) 

363.59 364.56 B: mhm 

366.44 371.08 B: do you think that the u._n. still has after after showing 

371.31 373.75 B: basically that the u._s. ignored 

374.11 375.37 B: (( the u._n. )) 

375.25 377.14 B: uh going in iraq 

376.92 377.91 B: because 

377.74 390.61 B: they didn't support the actions do you feel like the u._n. maybe is weakened and is unable to control rogue countries like north korea now or do you feel like the u._n. still has a role in helping build these countries in the future do 

386.69 387.63 A: (( uh )) 

390.06 391.53 A: (( but as )) 

390.43 393.11 B: we forget about the u._n. or keep working with them 

392.83 400.85 A: (( far as what they're doing yeah showing some signs of weakness could mean that they don't wanna mhm do you )) 

401.07 411.62 A: (( think uh that the countries who are currently on the security council countries like france and germany who while are important western nations )) 

412.77 420.28 A: (( not so strong militarily anymore do you think that they should continue to serve on the security council )) 

418.23 419.15 B: mhm 

422.52 423.64 B: (( you )) 

424.55 425.59 B: (( know put )) 

426.25 427.76 B: (( their men and lives )) 

427.98 429.38 B: (( out )) 

435.09 435.98 B: (( there )) 

438.04 439.25 A: should they kee- 

438.13 441.80 B: considering considering that they're not as strong militarily as the u._s. 

441.75 445.36 A: right serve like as do you mean in nato or what do you mean 

445.44 454.00 B: i mean in the in the united nations security council um the council that that yeah it decides on military action and you know 

448.35 449.61 A: oh yeah yeah 

450.70 451.82 A: oh 

453.39 467.42 A: well man i mean i mean america needs all the hel- i would think that america needs all the help from all the nations out there i mean if even though they don't want to fight uh should have some type of back up not that they'll jump in but at least something you know 

458.70 459.57 B: mhm 

467.34 468.06 B: mhm 

467.42 474.05 A: uh for them to see what what's happening and for them to see what we're doing what we're accomplishing so that way they know hey you know 

474.44 478.66 A: what they were doing is right so maybe they'll jump in and help out a little i don't know 

478.86 486.37 A: whether it's not fighting but it's you know helping out with the food shortages out there where other other other means of civil 

482.24 483.12 B: mhm 

483.38 484.39 B: mhm 

486.41 487.66 B: mhm 

487.07 488.88 A: rights and all that 

489.41 490.41 B: so 

490.47 498.67 B: do you or anyone you know feel sort of directly threatened by north korea or is it just sort of a looming fear 

498.59 501.58 A: hm just a i would probably think a looming fear 

501.43 503.81 B: yeah it's not really something that 

502.81 503.91 A: (( no not a )) 

504.33 509.57 B: yeah yeah i think most people are probably just concerned that that it could get worse right 

507.26 508.46 A: yeah concerned 

508.72 512.51 A: right right it is if the problem isn't attended you know 

514.25 517.97 B: because they haven't had a history of something like terrorism 

516.98 519.26 A: exactly exactly it 

517.99 519.98 B: or yeah 

519.40 525.67 A: is just said to be that they're working that they have operations contained you know nuclear weapons 

524.72 526.39 B: mhm 

526.86 527.80 B: (( hm )) 

527.17 529.79 A: and that's only the country that i can think of right now 

529.75 535.29 B: yeah i mean that's the one that's in the news most often what about iran do you think iran is a threat 

532.26 533.55 A: yeah yeah 

535.53 538.11 A: uh well i haven't heard any 

537.02 539.97 B: it's grouped with north korea and iraq by president bush 

539.78 543.28 A: yeah yeah [noise] but uh 

543.54 555.19 A: yeah i don't know about iran because iran i mean they haven't they've got a lot of inspectors and right now north korea is the one who's not letting anyone come in you know come in and inspect inspection so 

548.33 549.16 B: mhm 

552.40 553.29 B: right 

554.66 557.35 B: right that is definitely true 

555.39 557.03 A: i would see more 

557.20 558.66 A: yeah yeah 

558.04 561.26 B: what if what if in the nex- in the coming months uh 

561.79 574.88 B: the u._s. government said that it was feeling uneasy about iran and it wanted to and there was no further evidence of weapons programs there and it wanted to do some sort of containment military action in iran would you support that 

574.35 578.82 A: if uh seriously what i would think is uh i would have to have more evidence 

578.86 580.63 A: for me to support anything 

580.40 582.57 B: more evidence yeah i would too 

580.84 581.78 A: (( [noise] )) 

583.45 584.53 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

585.00 586.97 A: hey just a sec man i'm sorry 

586.53 587.96 B: yeah
