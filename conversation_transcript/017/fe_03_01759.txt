2.28 3.19 B: hi 

3.00 3.83 A: hi 

4.97 5.86 B: um 

6.05 7.35 B: [laughter] 

7.14 10.04 A: let me close the window here [noise] 

10.11 12.19 B: yeah i think i'm all set as far as noise 

12.64 14.05 A: i'm sorry what 

13.45 15.39 B: i think i'm all set as far as noise 

15.21 24.04 A: yeah well we got these knucklehead protesters outside ah they've been going at it for about a year protesting this one business so it's it gets distracting at times [laughter] 

22.95 24.46 B: (( what are they protesting )) 

24.45 31.16 A: um business changed management they fired a bunch of employees and their employees are doing a shake down it's philly so 

28.83 29.66 B: oh 

31.34 32.38 B: where are you 

32.54 33.81 A: (( philly )) 

33.15 34.00 B: okay 

34.11 36.22 B: i'm in cambridge massachusetts 

35.41 37.08 A: (( [laughter] okay [laughter] )) 

37.53 39.80 B: um okay topic of the day is 

40.36 41.33 B: (( [laughter] )) 

41.43 46.24 B: um i frankly every time i have gotten one of these calls it's been about um 

46.49 52.21 B: current events like politics and war and you know terrorists and getting all 

52.22 53.88 A: how many calls have you done 

53.69 59.95 B: um this is the second one i have done a couple of my friends are also doing it and they have also gotten a lot of them too so 

59.24 60.66 A: (( hm )) 

60.03 60.91 B: anyway 

61.55 64.30 B: um [sigh] countries that are threats 

66.21 67.68 B: (( ah do you want to )) 

68.09 68.88 B: (( start )) 

68.80 73.01 A: [laughter] i am pretty relaxed here i've been writing a paper all day so my brain's pretty fried [laughter] 

72.89 76.39 B: [laughter] okay i i sympathize i just finished my thesis 

76.40 77.31 A: okay 

78.09 79.60 B: countries that are a threat 

82.08 84.04 A: how about we just say all of them and 

84.94 86.78 A: get it done with [laughter] 

86.90 92.90 B: yeah i'm actually i'm kind of worried not about the countries themselves so much as the fundamentalist groups 

93.32 98.75 B: and those exist worldwide and i don't think that it's 

96.13 97.36 A: mhm 

98.92 110.91 B: i mean the problem i have is i think one of the worse threats if they are looking for you know chemical attacks or whatever is not going to be governmental it's going to be from some small well funded group of 

110.61 116.47 A: well you could basically qu- call 'em quasi states because they have the resources of the state but they don't have normal territory 

113.94 115.22 B: that's true 

115.66 116.78 B: the boundaries 

117.36 118.24 A: so 

118.50 119.25 B: (( okay )) 

119.21 121.78 A: which basically makes it personal 

121.02 123.15 B: yeah and i i 

123.16 127.99 B: am also sort of interested in the i don't know how plausible this is interested in the 

129.22 130.13 B: (( ah )) 

130.26 134.19 B: some sort of a financial terrorism kind of thing 

134.29 139.60 B: does that make sense like the way that the middle east is dropping the dollar for trading 

139.48 140.68 A: mhm 

140.06 142.50 B: (( and like they are trading )) 

142.60 148.09 B: there a lot of the oil trade- they are being valued in euros now instead of dollars you know 

148.07 149.44 A: (( [mn] well )) 

148.60 151.91 B: it would be interesting if this there were some large scale 

152.49 154.86 B: dropping of the dollar on the international 

154.65 164.24 A: well you know doing something like that really conceivably has no effect because you know currency is interchangeable um you know the more serious concern you'd have is 

164.25 169.95 A: um specific access some states have done to undervalue the currency ah you know when we 

168.34 169.60 B: yeah 

170.05 176.74 A: ah one of the big problems we have had is some nation states actually go out of the way to produce um counterfeit u._s. currency 

176.15 176.96 B: yep 

176.92 181.54 A: part of it because u._s. currency buys you a lot but the other part of it is it devalues our currency 

180.95 182.15 B: yes it does 

182.28 183.29 A: um 

183.34 190.61 A: so i mean that's a serious concern but i am not so much concerned if prices are done in one currency over another because 

185.34 186.10 B: yeah 

191.35 197.85 B: [mn] i understand that and i i don't know a lot about oil trading [laughter] but i understand it does actually affect the 

198.51 202.35 B: value of the dollar because it affects the amount of trade that is being done with it 

202.55 203.54 A: mhm 

202.90 206.03 B: so it changes a lot of indexes but 

204.91 215.22 A: mm [mn] but at the same time the real value of currency is you know how much confidence people are willing to place in it and i'm not absolutely convinced that because some people decide not to do 

209.46 210.15 B: (( yes )) 

215.40 228.52 A: trade in that one sor- sort of currency it is going to automatically ah de- devalue it you know in some cases that might be symptomatic of a problem in the currency like if i stop doing business with you in rubles that's probably for good reason but [laughter] 

225.97 227.19 B: (( [laughter] )) 

227.49 229.94 B: yeah bad time for the ruble 

229.76 232.47 A: oh it's always a bad time for the ruble 

232.08 239.70 B: well it's it was just something that's sort of been occurring to me as i read some things i just sort of wonder about the plausibility of it 

239.57 241.11 A: yeah i i think 

240.18 241.17 B: (( 'cause it didn't )) 

241.35 242.63 B: i'm sorry 

242.03 252.48 A: i think the the real serious prob- ah problem when it comes to financial security is that it's probably and i guess from my perspective it's informational hubs or you know distribution hubs 

251.92 252.78 B: mhm 

252.53 255.83 A: you know that's that would really slow things down 

255.49 256.37 B: yes 

256.58 258.06 A: um you know if 

258.51 264.37 A: if commerce gets you know interfered with you know even at one point that could cost millions or billions of dollars a day so 

264.31 265.98 B: yeah i and just 

266.69 269.74 B: and ah the dial a service attacks you can 

270.84 275.17 B: take out communications and cost a lot of people a lot of money 

275.03 276.91 A: oh yeah um 

276.04 277.12 B: and 

277.25 278.99 A: well and there was another 

277.56 278.29 B: that's 

278.41 279.66 B: not that hard 

279.81 287.27 A: a great example in the ah atlantic monthly recently where they were talking about how just oil production in saudi arabia is incredibly vulnerable to just 

287.54 293.18 A: you know a handful of attacks and that could basically effectively shut down of all all of saudi arabia's oil production 

292.80 295.66 B: oh what kind of what kind of attacks like the 

294.91 296.73 A: um well there 

295.86 297.18 B: pipelines 

297.54 299.94 B: breaking people and such or 

299.62 311.09 A: the refineries themselves are concentrated in very specific areas with lax security pipelines um you take that stuff out and you have effectively shutdown that country's production 

305.26 305.98 B: (( okay )) 

310.73 311.50 B: yeah 

311.92 313.07 A: um 

313.13 324.60 A: you know so i mean that's always a concern you have when you're i guess you're dealing with commerces there might be some areas that really are concentrated and you know interference in that spot can cause some pretty nasty effects 

324.18 324.92 B: yeah 

325.11 329.93 A: you know not not anything that can be overcome but certainly cause headaches for the time being [laughter] mhm 

330.06 331.79 B: (( oh no kidding i )) 

333.58 335.72 B: mean it's bad enough when they have um 

336.20 347.17 B: i don't remember where it was i think it was somewhere more towards africa where they were having problems with people breaking ah the oil pipelines for i think it was shell that was having really bad problems with it and 

347.45 350.56 B: it was causing serious environmental problems and economic 

350.52 352.61 A: [mn] yeah that's right um 

351.68 353.60 B: issues with production yep 

353.86 357.23 A: yeah that's yeah i mean that's one of the big 

357.44 366.16 A: things with an oil pipeline going through a bunch of countries it does cause those problems you have to provide security along the way and if one country becomes destabilized it's a valuable target [mn] um but 

374.58 379.51 A: yeah but ah such a i love how they give these broad ranging questions 

380.19 383.57 B: [laughter] it wouldn't have been such a problem for me except for the fact that ah 

385.06 386.77 B: it it's very 

387.27 390.92 B: ah awkward to talk about current events with someone that 

391.88 395.27 B: you don't know necessarily and have an idea of what 

395.42 398.46 B: (( their background is i guess until you're just sort of started on this )) 

396.83 401.22 A: or are you a little bit intimidated on what their opinions are on it but you don't know that [laughter] 

399.82 408.36 B: well not opinions so much as you start on a certain topic and there is no segue for us and so it's sort of artificially spawned [laughter] 

408.33 409.87 A: yeah 

409.23 410.63 B: and i mean i 

410.90 413.92 B: don't know what the purpose of the study is but i wonder if 

413.94 420.79 A: i i'm actually curious if the purpose of the study is to see where conversations go from these specific topics 

414.66 416.10 B: (( if that has anything to do with it )) 

420.38 422.54 B: yeah i'd believe that 

421.32 422.20 A: um 

422.67 436.24 A: you know do do people end up shifting into talking about personal stuff or you know that sort of thing like are people more comfortable going into talking with a complete stranger about stuff in their life as opposed to talking about these distant things 

435.84 437.04 B: yeah 

436.89 438.02 A: but 

437.41 439.87 B: i think in some of the cases they would end up with some dif- 

440.09 442.32 B: some real differences based on 

442.76 445.60 B: ah not only where you come from obviously but 

445.67 447.80 B: ah i think based on 

448.11 449.16 B: (( ah )) 

449.25 451.33 B: education slash awareness 

451.46 452.97 B: kind of levels 

453.32 454.09 B: (( but )) 

453.71 459.77 A: mhm mhm yeah but so far every well i've only gotten two people on this but they were they were all college educated 

458.78 459.65 B: mhm 

459.83 464.44 A: which doesn't surprise me since stuff like this just seems to attract college students 

464.92 469.11 B: well i think since it is done by a college it sort of passes through other university mailing lists 

468.57 472.55 A: exactly and you know it's money for just talking on the phone for ten minutes 

472.52 473.73 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

474.85 477.93 B: are are you then economics or management 

477.77 480.06 A: [laughter] i'm actually ah studying law 

479.80 480.68 B: (( type of person )) 

481.05 483.63 A: and background is in math 

483.26 484.04 B: (( okay okay )) 

484.84 487.50 A: so i've got a little touch of everything 

487.00 487.96 B: yeah 

488.98 490.95 A: um but 

492.96 497.26 A: [mn] mhm if i knew i know someone else if you were doing this he would just make the entire 

497.37 499.57 A: conversation for them centered on the french 

500.21 501.40 B: on french 

501.08 502.30 A: on the french [laughter] 

502.58 506.16 B: i have nothing against the french [mn] we had a 

506.97 513.68 B: we actually my we had an exchange student staying with our family earlier this month or this year because they have um 

514.09 516.73 B: they have to do they are required to do internships 

517.32 519.64 B: to graduate from 

519.94 522.92 B: a lot of colleges and 

520.89 522.04 A: mhm 

522.95 535.16 B: she was working for my parents and she came in and she's like i don't understand why all the american people think france is so terrible blah blah blah it's like it's it's not most of americans just these few people that make the news 

536.06 543.92 A: i don't know about that i think the numbers are much higher in middle america for a good bit of french bashing over the dinner table 

543.49 546.08 B: this is in minnesota so 

544.74 546.05 A: okay [laughter] [laughter] 

546.60 549.46 B: i i don't think it's that bad personally yet [laughter] 

548.16 551.34 A: well then again minnesota is an aberration in the midwest 

551.86 555.26 B: [laughter] i'd like to take that as a compliment [mn] 

554.55 557.69 A: (( [laughter] hey take it however you want [laughter] )) 

558.18 561.78 A: i mean not many midwestern states would produce will stone and [laughter] 

558.32 559.04 B: (( ah )) 

561.93 562.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

563.05 566.61 B: yeah or unfortunately um like wolvagon 

566.73 567.96 B: (( crap what's his name )) 

568.23 569.29 B: gergen keeler 

569.20 570.53 A: yep 

570.02 572.50 B: (( um yeah but ah )) 

572.73 573.66 B: she was just 

574.06 581.64 B: [mn] appalled that people could support the things that were going on in the country and it's like no they you know they don't a lot of them actually 

582.27 583.21 B: (( like )) 

586.18 587.53 A: (( hm [mn] ah )) 

588.39 592.50 B: oh the other thing that occurs to me in in discussing things like these is that ah 

592.84 594.29 B: (( i'm )) 

595.03 598.07 B: i just have a really hard time believing anything that i hear any more
