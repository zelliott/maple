9.28 12.07 A: this is my fir- go ahead this is my first call so i'm 

11.32 12.84 B: (( yeah me too [laughter] )) 

12.10 12.94 A: (( okay )) 

13.00 14.03 A: (( good )) 

14.25 18.47 B: um so what what do you feel about ah computers in education 

18.35 25.64 A: well i think i actually am a former first grade teacher and i think they can be beneficial in some areas and i think 

21.66 22.47 B: okay 

25.57 33.79 A: um i have seen teachers plug their kids in to computers too often [laughter] at school rather than actually teaching them so i think they can be deterring too so 

33.84 36.12 A: ah do you have any feelings about 

35.40 46.51 B: ah yeah i i'm kind of a plus and minus myself too i mean it it's good to um keep up with technology and everything else but on the other hand i think um kids are 

41.62 42.25 A: (( them )) 

42.75 43.72 A: right 

46.82 48.67 B: having a problem writing 

48.35 49.52 A: yes 

48.92 53.76 B: you know they their writing fails because their typing skills are up you know so i think it's 

53.36 61.35 A: and i've actually had a child tell me that well i don't need to practise my handwriting because my mom says i'm just gonna use a computer later on in life 

60.65 62.43 B: yeah [laughter] 

61.63 66.76 A: it's like okay short of being a doctor i'm not sure your co workers are gonna be real tolerant of that 

67.12 68.11 A: so 

67.13 69.77 B: yeah i don't think ah many people 

69.87 75.23 B: they've gone so much to emailing and everything else they don't write as much so i think 

74.93 78.73 A: well and i think and i think in email sometimes 

75.26 76.00 B: (( you know )) 

79.04 81.43 A: they tend to lose out on grammar 

81.08 82.35 B: exactly 

81.75 83.56 A: [laughter] and that drives me nuts 

84.09 90.81 A: i'm one of those people i'm thinking i can get six year olds to capitalize and use punctuation you know you're thirty plus years old 

90.25 91.51 B: (( [laughter] )) 

91.24 99.57 A: you know i think i think we get into a different mind set with the computer it's like oh all those grammar rules don't apply to me and it's like well yeah hello 

98.99 100.56 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

100.74 104.77 A: capital letter at the beginning of the sentence say way as it's been since you were five [laughter] 

104.15 105.71 B: (( yep [laughter] [laughter] )) 

105.69 110.44 A: so but i also can see you know i 

110.50 113.54 A: i made a joke to somebody a while back um 

114.42 127.95 A: i did my masters in education and it was right when compu- five or six years when computers became available at our school and she had hand typed hers and i thought oh my gosh can you imagine hand typing eighty pages 

128.49 138.85 A: and you know the kids here do res- in in our area do research papers and i thought can you even imagine typing ten pages of a paper making a mistake and having to type a whole page over again 

138.48 139.85 B: oh yeah 

139.25 142.42 A: so i could see where they're definitely convenient for kids but 

143.33 147.16 A: but you know the internet's another big scary thing we 

146.50 147.61 B: yep 

147.32 148.93 A: you know we had a 

149.54 157.23 A: couple of very highly intelligent sixth grader hack into some sites that they probably sh- oh there's no probably they shouldn't have been in and it's like 

157.36 158.59 A: okay 

158.45 159.61 B: oh no 

158.65 160.93 A: because unfortunately almost 

161.09 164.86 A: i mean the younger kids are smarter than the adults when it comes to computers 

164.15 169.08 B: oh yeah because they've been practising on on them a lot more than we have you know it's [laughter] 

168.31 173.22 A: yep many much more experience it's scary 

173.53 174.60 A: (( so )) 

174.70 177.13 B: i mean it's good that they can you know 

177.16 186.88 B: get on with the the news and you know and check things all around the world i mean that's that's something that we haven't had you know i didn't have when i was growing up i mean 

179.28 180.17 A: right 

184.05 185.00 A: right 

186.13 187.65 A: no i didn't either 

187.36 191.88 B: we had the actual programs on the computers when i was in grade school but 

191.29 192.39 A: mhm 

191.91 194.20 B: you had no access to actually live 

194.51 195.45 B: um 

195.94 201.43 B: live news or anything that you can do research papers i mean now you can grab stuff from all over the place and 

200.77 202.79 A: right and i 

202.95 204.22 A: i um 

204.31 212.54 A: i was telling my sister also teaches she teaches high school english and i was telling her lately recently i said you know the scary thing is when i was in junior high school 

212.48 225.40 A: the big thing was not the computer the big thing was the electric typewriter and who got to use the electric typewriters in typing class that day she was like you're kidding right i'm like no we've come so far so fast sometimes i wonder 

216.95 217.71 B: [laughter] 

225.43 228.96 A: if we've kept you know the control of of it 

229.37 238.78 A: under you know as we're going so fast it's hard to to know you know where do we need to be watching kids and what do you need to be monitoring with kids and and things like that 

240.04 240.81 A: so 

241.33 245.75 A: but i do think you know they're definitely beneficial and it definitely makes things easier 

245.39 249.51 B: yeah and it gets them ready for a lot of the stuff out in the 

246.20 247.06 A: (( ah )) 

249.54 252.66 B: real world in the jobs i mean you can't go anywhere without 

252.39 253.35 A: no 

253.10 258.35 B: needing typing skills of a certain speed and everything else and they wouldn't have that if they didn't have the practise 

257.99 263.53 A: well they think as a society our speed is you know our typing speed is is increasing 

258.42 259.27 B: (( on the )) 

263.15 264.34 B: yeah 

264.01 270.34 A: on on a daily basis so that's i mean that's very good to prepare them for later on in life it's just sometimes that 

270.59 274.53 A: that adult control sometimes needs to be there i think 

275.04 277.27 B: (( yeah there definitely needs to be supervision on ah )) 

276.85 277.87 A: yes 

277.56 278.74 B: on the computer 

278.58 279.68 A: so 

280.40 287.92 A: especially i think with the littler ones 'cause i think sometimes well even the bigger ones i think they'll go in and do it on purpose but i know sometimes with the littler ones they 

287.90 301.16 A: get places they don't know how they've got i mean you know they get places they don't know how they've gotten to and they're not afraid to push buttons [laughter] that's what i always used to say how did you get there well i don't know i just started pushing buttons and i thought oh my oh my 

292.51 293.26 B: (( yep )) 

300.93 306.51 A: (( let me just call the office and let them know that this was an accident [laughter] so )) 

307.02 308.69 A: but 

308.84 313.29 A: but it definitely has its you know its advantages and conveniences 

313.74 314.61 A: so 

315.53 316.65 A: let's see 

317.85 321.60 A: what other advantages for education could we have or disadvantages 

322.05 323.20 A: um 

327.39 331.15 A: well it definitely makes note passing easier for kids in school 

330.63 331.96 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

331.34 336.43 A: [laughter] i hadn't thought about that but yeah i guess that 

337.36 342.45 A: you know i don't know if that's good or bad i mean i guess we all did it when we were in school passing the little 

342.67 344.08 A: the little notes 

344.23 345.24 A: along 

345.69 348.03 A: about heaven only knows what 

348.52 349.49 A: so 

348.83 350.40 B: yeah like in in 

350.76 354.25 B: in college courses and stuff it's a lot easier to ah 

355.05 357.39 B: keep up with things on the on the computer 

357.10 358.41 A: right 

357.79 358.86 B: rather than 

358.97 360.44 B: (( you know in um )) 

361.47 365.75 B: a lot of people bring laptops and everything else into the things and take notes 

365.99 367.07 B: during the 

367.17 368.85 B: the lectures 

368.51 370.40 A: oh that would be a good i see i 

370.35 384.79 A: guess i'm way out of the loop i didn't even think about that and you know it does make it a little easier for people you know like stay at home parents and things to get educated you can you know go ahead and take computer classes over the internet and things like that if you you know have access in your home 

371.64 372.55 B: [laughter] 

384.76 385.92 B: yeah that's true 

385.83 396.51 A: i i have a couple of friends who just finished some continuing education classes on the computer and they were like this is the weirdest thing [laughter] you don't talk to anybody i thought oh my goodness 

392.37 393.25 B: [laughter] 

396.89 400.71 B: yeah i took a course um at home like that in 

400.71 415.11 B: addressing i took it through my work but i could do it from home and do the studying and stuff and it really did you know improve how my how i worked you know i mean taking a and taking classes um 

403.17 404.25 A: mhm 

410.35 411.27 A: right 

415.22 424.67 B: on line and through your home and stuff and just keep edu- just to keep my brain working you know i'm a stay at home mom also right now and so it's like it's really hard to 

420.72 421.61 A: right 

424.70 427.05 B: i don't want my brain to turn to mush 

426.45 427.95 A: [laughter] i know 

427.21 428.11 B: [laughter] 

428.39 431.34 A: i know exactly what you're saying i ah 

431.36 436.10 A: 'cause that's what they say well you know you don't have to i was a first ah teacher and they said well you know 

436.19 443.05 A: when i quit my district said you don't have to go back and get any more education hours for twelve or fifteen years or something 'cause of your masters and i thought 

442.97 452.77 A: i may need to go back to school just to keep my brain you know flowing in that process and the convenience of going you know just being able to do it from my you know my home 

447.85 449.07 B: exactly 

452.87 456.07 A: and do it on line [noise] you know will 

456.22 460.46 A: will definitely help in prep- preparing me to go back into the workforce one day 

461.21 462.65 A: (( so but )) 

464.34 466.15 B: i think there's a lot of good um 

466.25 473.12 B: programs on the computer that can be good for teaching tools i mean there ah like powerpoint and access 

469.58 470.89 A: right 

473.20 480.75 B: programs that you know help get people more organized with their i mean you can store recipes you can store um 

479.34 480.17 A: right 

481.16 483.29 B: you know exercise routines everything on there 

481.20 482.39 A: and there's a lot 

482.97 487.88 A: and there's a lot of good programs for young children as long as i think it's not overused 

485.20 486.14 B: yeah 

487.68 491.08 A: you know the little the repetition is so good for them 

490.85 497.00 A: and the fact that you can program things i remember one my last year of teaching we had gotten some program and i can't even remember what it was called 

496.77 510.99 A: but you could program it so that it would change with the level the child's learning levels and i thought now this is this is a great way that everybody can be exactly where they need to be you know if if once you pass the level you got to go on to the next level 

507.02 507.97 B: mhm 

510.85 518.22 A: so it made it very easy for kids that needed a little bit more to get a little bit more and it made it easy for kids that needed to um 

518.92 525.10 A: maybe go over the same things you know for the fourth or fifth time it gave them the ability to do that too so 

525.80 528.42 A: the repetition was there if they needed it 

528.21 529.51 B: yeah 

528.75 529.66 A: so 

532.61 536.63 A: let's see we said research it was very helpful with research 

537.97 540.68 B: yep i've i've a friend who does um 

542.06 542.85 B: i guess 

542.86 544.69 B: pre school 

544.51 545.39 A: mhm 

544.79 548.51 B: um training for her kid um teaching them how to read 

548.17 549.12 A: right 

548.53 549.45 B: um 

549.67 561.57 B: and in that case i mean it works but yet she doesn't read to them out of an actual book then that often either so it's a lot more you know on line learning sentences learning grammar 

553.40 554.25 A: right 

561.50 562.89 A: but then they're not 

561.57 565.69 B: they use different sort of programs but they're not actually picking up the actual book anymore so 

565.10 565.85 A: (( mm )) 

566.18 570.50 B: i mean it's it can i mean it's a plus but then [laughter] i mean yeah 

568.78 574.19 A: right they're they're still together reading but you know by the same token it's not out of a 

574.22 575.69 A: (( you know i think )) 

574.98 581.32 B: exactly if something were to happen with technology and all the computers in the world were shut down then what are people going to work on you know 

581.11 583.65 A: that's exactly it and i think you know as 

582.04 583.06 B: [laughter] 

583.99 589.37 A: i mean as kids come up and get older they become more dependent on the computers too 

588.86 589.85 B: yeah 

589.27 599.89 A: whereas you know if my computer died and my internet access my d._s._l. line died tomorrow it would kind of be a bummer but it wouldn't you know wouldn't be the end of the world 'cause [laughter] we've been there before 

597.23 599.40 B: (( it won't be the end of the world yeah [laughter] ))
