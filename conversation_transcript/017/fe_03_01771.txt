11.80 13.84 A: okay i'm in san diego 

13.56 20.59 B: oh how about that okay [laughter] well so it sounds like they're keeping quite current with the with the choice of topics here 

15.16 17.07 A: (( yeah )) 

21.13 23.37 A: i know it's kind of um 

23.56 26.92 A: i don't know kind of difficult off the top of my head 

27.26 29.53 A: okay so you could start 

28.97 30.60 B: well um 

31.10 37.99 B: one thing i gotta ah say about you know nations that pose a threat to the united states 

38.04 43.32 B: um all during this you know the the the whole invasion of iraq 

43.66 46.72 B: i was saying okay you know [laughter] 

44.01 44.70 A: yes 

46.69 61.23 B: i'm i i think this is a bad idea but boy i am hoping that you find something something really horrendous and horrible there that will convince me that my gosh you were right all along and they were a threat and you know and 

61.26 67.02 B: i'm grateful to you you you stopped you stopped a hitler in the making and you know prevent so 

67.39 71.44 B: ah i keep hoping they'll find something like that just so i can 

72.13 75.74 B: breathe a sigh of relief and say okay good it was for a good reason after all 

75.76 79.91 B: ah because other than that i had the opinion that um 

81.17 86.53 B: you know that iraq didn't did not pose a a threat to the united states and that ah 

86.75 95.99 B: all the other reasons for going there you know like the u._n. sanctions that disobeys yeah yeah we should have done something about that any time between nineteen ninety one and nineteen ninety eight 

96.00 101.06 B: um but right now you know it's a bad idea to try picking a fight about it right now 

101.33 108.49 B: so that's what i'd say about iraq now for other nations i can maybe think of some other stuff about them but what [laughter] does that 

107.83 109.09 A: (( right )) 

108.96 111.42 B: peak your interest or spark anything for you 

110.30 111.38 A: [laughter] 

112.08 116.65 A: no for for iraq i don't know 

116.88 121.54 A: if i thought there's ever been a direct threat however 

121.55 124.16 A: i have thought even if um 

124.91 130.27 A: ah bush and the administration had information that they might have um 

130.25 143.35 A: chemical weapons or mass destruction weapons i'm not sure that iraq would even target the united states directly because of it being on the other side of the world 

131.42 132.34 B: uh-huh 

143.32 145.83 A: however i think that 

146.23 155.97 A: they wouldn't have any hesitation to maybe attack israel or even a european country if if if they wanted to 

156.10 165.14 A: um however i think the terrorist group in northern iraq i'm not recalling their name right now 

164.08 166.44 B: (( mhm ham- al hamas um )) 

167.25 169.39 B: is there one [laughter] 

168.62 171.05 A: (( there's a there's a [laughter] )) 

169.90 173.17 B: this isn't the kurds coming back and reclaiming their territory is it 

172.78 181.53 A: no no no not the kurds but there's a um terrorist group in northern iraq that also has meas- ah members in iran 

181.88 184.50 A: and they have been associated with 

184.58 188.03 A: al qaeda um in some 

188.46 193.63 A: they're saying the ricin cases and maybe even just um 

194.89 199.98 A: training cross training between the al qaeda and those terrorist groups 

198.97 200.51 B: well if i 

200.64 202.28 B: oh go ahead 

201.76 207.90 A: oh so even though saddam hussein he was funding them directly 

207.80 217.31 A: um there might be a threat from iraq to the united states in kind of it's kind of direct or in- indirect at the same time 

216.80 221.23 B: well i agree i mean i ah i'm with you there i mean after ah 

221.28 235.85 B: you know september eleventh two thousand and one of course when ah bush was saying you know we're going to come get you and you know if you you are a terrorist if you're harboring a terrorist we're not going to make a distinction we're going to get you i you know i thought okay right on um 

225.13 226.11 A: right 

234.95 235.84 A: right 

235.86 239.86 B: but all during this time you know when they when they 

240.15 248.91 B: you know flipped their ah switch and decided that it was now you know like false ash and now it's time to start talking about iraq last year um 

247.98 248.83 A: right 

249.47 250.91 B: there was this whole 

251.63 259.04 B: sort of you know pa- parade of reasons why we should do it just like when you know his first tax cut he said well we should do it because um 

259.05 271.60 B: ah you know we need the economic stimulus or you know we should do it because we're making so much money that you know we should give some back to the people who earned it but then when there's a crash no no well actually no now we need it for this reason 

267.56 268.39 A: right 

271.64 278.34 B: and so of all these reasons for invading iraq it was only around i think you know october or something that they finally said ah 

278.60 291.64 B: oh yes and and there is a link to al qaeda and that's like you know they finally said oh oh yeah yeah if if we can convince them of that they'll buy that so okay and magically now there are connections to al qaeda and what i hear 

284.83 285.89 A: right 

291.94 297.29 B: i i listen to it and if i hadn't if i didn't have all that other baggage with it i would say 

297.15 308.34 B: wow you're right but as it is i say you know if you if you if you people had just told me that to begin with maybe i'd buy it but now it just sounds like you're saying that 'cause you know that that i consider that a good reason 

298.41 299.78 A: right 

308.26 312.74 B: and so now i just don't know what to believe you guys are saying any more 

312.98 314.10 B: so ah 

314.10 328.87 B: ah if there is indeed an al qaeda connection i say okay go get them you know i agree yes we know al qaeda is a threat um but you know what what about what about afghanistan that you know you stopped talking about and what about you know all all these other places that it's 

329.06 331.26 B: you know if it's really al qaeda 

331.61 333.76 B: why am i not hearing 

334.23 338.65 B: i don't even know what it what it would take to make a convincing case for me now because they so thoroughly 

338.88 341.58 B: destroyed any credibility ah 

342.11 345.93 B: that they had with me even before they invaded i just you know i don't 

345.92 360.90 B: i just can't believe what i don't know what to believe from you guys any more you know nothing you can it's like you know when your kid has lied to you ah you know about you know what happened to the cookies in the cookie jar and when he finally tells the truth you know you can't tell if he's telling the truth or not 

348.73 349.36 A: (( uh-huh )) 

356.93 358.02 A: right 

361.43 365.54 A: yeah well i have i've gotten the impression that 

365.90 369.91 A: the um federal government has known 

369.96 371.19 A: for 

371.32 379.11 A: at least ten years and probably you know many years before that before the first gulf war that 

379.33 381.58 A: iraq was a threat 

381.70 388.27 A: and that they were a threat to middle middle east um peace and world peace 

387.83 388.71 B: uh-huh 

388.32 389.64 A: and 

390.02 398.35 A: it was it was almost like they were looking for an excuse and they have been looking for an excuse before bush was even in office 

397.79 398.67 B: right 

398.54 402.87 A: and finally something came across where 

403.19 413.20 A: they say okay here's our chance and we're going to have to take it because we might not get another opportunity for who knows how many years and by then it might be too late 

413.79 417.16 A: because they passed up their last chance ten years ago 

416.28 418.27 B: (( mhm )) 

417.73 418.73 A: um 

418.83 420.82 A: but nothing 

421.10 426.10 A: nothing is ever repeated in the media if if i hear um 

426.64 429.21 A: a government official speak 

429.47 439.33 A: it seems like directly you you hear what they say and you could draw your own conclusions but i think the media has really got a horrible job to 

435.23 436.09 B: uh-huh 

439.39 441.30 A: only report um 

442.00 446.57 A: shocking information or partial information 

446.62 450.20 A: and and not really present the whole story 

446.64 447.92 B: yeah 

450.24 451.27 A: um 

451.37 456.96 A: i got an email today you know just these forwards that always go through but 

457.21 461.51 A: it was a conversation between al gore and oliver north 

461.73 462.88 A: and 

463.03 473.71 A: it was years and years ago when al gore was a senator and he was questioning oliver north about some security system he was putting in his house 

473.71 481.02 A: and um oliver north said that he received a threat from osama bin laden and his um 

482.14 484.57 A: fellow you know associates 

483.64 485.28 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

484.68 485.86 A: and 

486.05 487.40 A: and um 

487.99 496.60 A: al gore just couldn't believe that he would spend so much money on a personal security system of like sixty thousand dollars just to secure his home or something 

496.76 502.75 A: and he said this is the most dangerous man in the world and i'm going to protect my family 

502.49 505.96 B: when was this is like nineteen ninety something 

505.78 518.24 A: yeah it was you know years before even september eleventh happened um i don't i don't recall the year off the top of my head but it seems like a lot of these people have known 

518.25 519.33 A: um 

519.82 524.85 A: for a period of time that there's these dangerous people but they haven't been able to do anything 

524.64 526.15 B: mhm 

525.54 527.77 A: and then they had another um 

527.89 529.76 A: old news clipping 

529.82 532.70 A: when clinton was in office and 

533.42 535.04 A: the um 

535.48 536.16 A: (( the )) 

536.38 545.82 A: i guess the pilot the terrorist pilot that flew into tower one of the trade centre he was actually um 

542.21 543.77 B: (( mhm right )) 

546.61 552.14 A: arrested for something while clinton was in office but um 

552.40 563.24 A: the u._s. government didn't want to have any kind of terrorist groups in jail or what whatever was going on they they didn't want to have this 

563.64 577.15 A: bad association with a middle eastern country at this time or whatever so clinton said no just let him go just let him go you know and then a couple of years later it turns out that he was a super super bad guy 

576.71 584.91 B: yeah and again it's all i mean i just you know everything i hear i have no idea how much of that i should believe any more than 

584.32 586.49 A: right right right 

585.27 587.93 B: if that's if that's true then oh yeah jeeze 

588.20 589.26 B: um 

589.55 590.46 B: so 

590.52 592.16 B: (( i mean yeah the )) 

591.43 592.12 A: (( [noise] )) 

592.52 593.62 B: (( go ahead )) 

593.99 595.08 A: (( yeah i'm here )) 

595.47 596.43 B: um
