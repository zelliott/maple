50.92 55.20 A: i guess you know watch people get humiliated i guess that's entertaining 

55.58 64.02 B: it's interesting because it makes you realize just how many [mn] bad people are out there like how untalented people are but it's also it's like really depressing 

63.96 66.59 A: (( [mn] yeah yeah i think )) 

66.96 68.35 A: [mn] [cough] i think um

131.10 134.29 A: humiliating people seeing like with the ah 

134.47 136.89 A: who wants to marry a millionaire or whatever

142.46 151.48 B: that was that was pretty frightening [mn] but i just i never really like any of the characters i wish i that they had people on there who were like normal or somewhat interesting 

144.84 145.80 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

151.40 152.26 A: right

239.22 241.04 A: i know [laughter] 

241.52 252.14 A: [mn] but just i mean basically what the show did was humiliate the girls you know i'm saying like afterwards it's like ha ha you're competing for this guy who makes twenty thousand dollars a year [mn] [laughter] 

251.58 255.12 B: what happened with ah with the end of that did they 

255.38 258.65 B: like did the woman he ended up like him still

268.05 277.66 A: and she was like okay well you know that's fine i still that's good i wanna you know date you or whatever [mn] and then the show gave them a million dollars together 

277.98 279.79 A: like as a surprise 

279.47 280.73 B: oh [mn] 

280.53 289.01 A: and then i think a couple of weeks later i heard that they they broke up like they split the million and [mn] went their separate ways [mn]

439.03 440.29 A: [laughter] 

441.52 451.44 B: [lipsmack] the gags they pulled like when they pretended to be old people and then they'd like like this guy pretended he was an old person who'd lost a brace on his wheelchair and was going down a hill

464.47 465.38 A: that 

465.51 472.49 A: sounds a lot like the the regular show that comes on m._t._v. because i've seen one like a guy in a wheelchair like 

472.97 481.88 A: he falls down flights of steps like the wheelchair and he f- falls out of it they're like are you okay are you okay and he's acting like and he just gets up and walks off [mn] 

482.26 489.56 A: just stupid stuff like that but i guess i think it's entertaining [mn] or i saw one episode where they umm um this guy went to an outhouse 

489.83 493.56 A: or what's it called ah not outhouse um port a potty 

493.22 494.41 B: oh right

509.05 512.29 A: got poop dripping from him it's disgusting [laughter] 

512.87 522.86 B: yeah when the guy was gonna take a crap in the ah in the hardware store too like he like had to go really really bad beforehand and he like accidentally just did it in his pants 

519.73 520.84 A: [laughter] 

523.00 530.60 B: and then there was 'nother thing when they took like snow cone ice and a guy peed on it and then ate it [mn] like it was a snow cone
