14.36 15.26 B: uh-huh 

14.57 22.88 A: um well i i've basically like watched an episode here an episode there but never really you know like i- 

19.26 20.55 B: yeah 

22.74 36.03 A: i don't watch like one from start to finish as far as like the whole season is concerned like to keep up with the people on survivor or whatever i think like the closest one i've ever kept up with is like american idol 

27.64 28.54 B: uh-huh 

35.70 36.71 B: right 

35.97 39.02 A: you know because everybody talks about that one i 

38.04 41.17 B: oh of course [laughter] it's everywhere [laughter] 

41.40 56.13 A: i mean it's on the i mean i'm reading the newspaper trying to get real news and it's like guess who got kicked off of american idol [laughter] you know so i mean it's just like oh this is so ridiculous but i hope that the whole genre 

45.52 46.59 B: uh-huh 

47.96 49.24 B: [laughter] 

53.82 54.89 B: it is 

56.11 59.62 A: i hope it at some point just collapses [laughter] 

59.24 61.87 B: you know what i don't think it will [laughter] 

61.88 69.37 B: everybody yeah everybody's just so sucked in and you know as i badmouth it all the time but i'm sitting there watching 'em [laughter] 

61.88 63.07 A: really 

69.19 70.69 A: i know isn't it terrible 

69.88 76.87 B: you know i know i'm always talking about oh they're so stupid i can't believe they do that and blah blah blah blah blah but i sit there and watch 'em just the same 

71.43 72.10 A: (( [laughter] )) 

76.97 85.46 B: you know so [laughter] and i think i think just because it's so unpredictable there's no script [noise] like you don't know what's going to happen 

78.53 79.62 A: i know 

85.24 86.51 A: mhm 

85.64 93.67 B: it draws more people into it that's why that's why they keep coming up with you know more stuff and new things new shows 

88.58 89.45 A: yeah 

93.77 95.48 B: that's why it's so popular 

93.99 94.98 A: yeah 'cause 

95.35 102.37 A: i guess y- you know it starts off i- li- as like every man's experience or whatever you know like like i can do that it's 

100.05 101.06 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

101.48 103.15 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

102.62 111.71 A: i'm doing that you know but i think reality t._v. is starting to go into the realm of unreality i i mean it's just like okay 

103.38 104.94 B: [laughter] yeah 

109.26 110.26 B: yeah 

111.67 116.61 A: can you really see yourself over in the far regions of africa 

116.54 130.21 A: you know running jumping you know surviving going through all these tribal that is not rea- okay yeah it's reality for the bushmen but it's not a reality for most people who watch that show sh- show 

117.57 118.63 B: [laughter] 

120.89 122.23 B: [laughter] 

124.86 126.84 B: right [laughter] 

127.68 131.45 B: [laughter] that's true that's true [noise] 

130.23 136.27 A: so i'm just like you're going to an extreme and these these millionaire and these bachelor shows 

136.24 137.26 B: uh-huh 

136.40 148.32 A: i mean can you can you really see yourself asking someone to marry you that you've only known for six weeks and you pick 'em out of a lineup and you date 'em all 

141.73 143.62 B: no that's crazy 

146.56 147.48 B: yeah 

148.17 162.09 B: yeah that's sick [laughter] that's well i think that's that's again you know what draws more people to watch it because it's like that's something you would never do but yeah watching this idiot do it and oh my gosh how's it going to end up [laughter] you know 

149.99 151.35 A: yes [laughter] 

157.20 158.17 A: yeah 

161.43 166.37 A: yeah i think instead of uh reality t._v. they just need to call it fantasy t._v. 

165.69 168.60 B: yeah [laughter] that's true 

166.85 180.76 A: or it's basically like y- you know whatever you whatever you can come up with in your imagination you know then then that's what you know that's what the day is well what do you think is like the worst one 

172.28 173.33 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

177.28 178.24 B: right 

181.30 190.25 B: uh i think the all those married by america and bachelor and bachelorette and now the um [lipsmack] what is that one where the guys are covered

191.32 193.50 B: what is th- mr personality 

193.12 194.32 A: yeah 

193.88 201.32 B: yeah i think that where you have to choose your life long partner fr- [laughter] from you know a few weeks n- nah [laughter] 

198.23 199.20 A: (( i know )) 

200.66 203.21 A: and they're masked no way 

201.79 207.70 B: those oh yeah yeah no no no 'cause the first thing you look at is a person's you know physical attractiveness 

207.57 214.46 A: yeah i mean regardless of whether you want to admit it or not i mean it's still true i mean you gotta wake up with that person for fifty years you know 

207.97 210.43 B: you know if i'd hate to say it but 

210.83 211.88 B: right [laughter] 

213.35 218.16 B: exactly [laughter] y- you gotta like what you see [laughter] 

214.64 216.43 A: (( they gotta be able to do something )) 

217.35 219.29 A: yeah you would hope 

218.82 223.83 B: (( [laughter] that's that's why i hooked up with my man you know [laughter] )) 

220.10 221.01 A: although

224.35 231.25 B: i saw him and said hey come talk to me [laughter] lord knows i wouldn't have talked to him if he was ugly [laughter] 

226.56 228.26 A: [laughter] 

230.21 237.20 A: and i know i wonder why how do they do this but um the worst one for me would probably be the 

232.46 233.31 B: [laughter] 

235.02 236.11 B: mhm 

237.63 247.91 A: worst one for me would probably be the um it's between the one where they've got the makeover show where they get the plastic surgery and create a whole new face 

247.14 248.77 B: oh god yeah 

248.37 251.22 A: that's like a new one and fear factor 

251.16 254.61 B: i love fear factor i'm obsessed [laughter] 

253.73 258.74 A: (( but the thing about fear factor is who in the world )) 

257.96 259.05 B: [laughter] 

258.79 269.27 A: is putting i mean who's going to eat that stuff you know who wants to eat you know an animal's parts that you don't even wanna see 

262.12 263.54 B: [laughter] 

268.11 269.09 B: (( ew oh )) 

269.35 275.38 B: it's so gross that's what makes me wanna watch it because i wanna see who really wants to eat that [laughter] i 

269.40 272.01 A: you know that's so gross 

272.29 273.66 A: [laughter] 

274.63 281.96 A: i know 'cause i mean it's like it made me sick to my stomach to watch it the times i did watch it i said oh no and only for fifty thousand [mn] 

277.60 278.69 B: (( know )) 

281.61 285.86 B: [laughter] i know they should up the [laughter] the prize 

284.62 298.42 A: they should and yeah because that one had like centipedes all in their hair and i mean they they were like pouring 'em pouring 'em all over and different stuff and i was just like okay and all this is fifty and you might not even win 

289.05 290.10 B: oh 

293.46 294.88 B: (( oh it's so gross )) 

298.36 311.07 B: oh my god i know [laughter] i feel so sorry for the ones that don't win because you did all that stupid you know those stupid stunts and you ate all that crap and nothing [laughter] you got nothing [laughter] 

298.73 300.16 A: so you know 

303.21 304.25 A: i know 

310.85 312.19 A: exactly 

311.56 316.50 B: i think they get like consolation prizes they should get like you know maybe a couple of thousand 

315.80 322.20 A: (( something yeah just for showing up they ought to get like two thousand bucks for showing or at least airfare [laughter] you know to )) 

318.36 319.23 B: (( something )) 

320.08 321.37 B: [laughter] i know 

322.05 329.03 B: for having the nerve [laughter] for having the nerve to stand and eat you know larvae 

322.23 323.52 A: make it worth their while 

325.13 326.00 A: so 

329.27 331.53 B: [laughter] for national television 

329.45 330.80 A: (( i know )) 

331.37 336.92 A: i just think that is the worst but you know these reality shows do you think that they're um 

333.56 334.66 B: oh that's gross 

337.01 342.10 A: i think they may be rigged i think some of them may be rigged really 

341.15 342.62 B: (( you think so )) 

343.48 357.96 A: i do i think they may be rigged because i mean that whole bachelor show it seemed like and see i didn't get this from secondhand opinion i'm reading the news and you know i mean watching the news and reading you know going on the you know watching those shows and stuff 

357.19 358.24 B: yeah 

357.95 365.23 A: but uh i think that you know they may be don't they tell them nah don't don't pick him [laughter] no don't pick her 

363.23 364.56 B: [laughter] 

364.85 366.53 B: they give 'em hints [laughter] 

366.47 374.46 A: yeah i mean i think that like america really wants to see you know something else than you know than what you're picking 

372.88 374.11 B: yeah 

374.13 379.44 B: that's i think they're doing that with american idol right now 'cause there's no way ruben could have been in their line up 

379.19 388.72 A: but no way they said the bottom ten i mean the bottom two i could not believe that well i mean everybody's loving ruben [mn] 

380.02 381.47 B: there's just no way 

382.48 383.56 B: oh yeah 

383.69 384.75 B: (( oh no )) 

385.14 386.74 B: no mm mm 

387.96 396.93 B: of course of course i think he's going to be in the top i think they're just trying to make it juicy so they put him on the line up just just to make people go what [laughter] 

394.10 395.06 A: yeah 

396.72 399.63 A: yeah but then josh josh should have been off

401.75 402.91 B: yeah 

403.00 404.20 B: (( yep )) 

404.05 410.16 A: but some of those other ones should have should have been off a long time ago too and they stuck it out i guess
