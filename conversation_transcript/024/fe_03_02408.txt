28.42 31.14 B: (( i'd have to say ah a- a- yeah )) 

33.27 37.91 B: all of them taking into consideration in in excessive i would have to say drinking 

37.52 39.07 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

39.86 41.07 A: um 

41.97 43.61 A: i agree 

43.75 47.07 A: with the excessiveness it would be drinking as well 

48.07 58.01 B: ah and i i i only think i think all of them in in excess are horrible but i think that um probably second would have been smoking 

50.84 52.71 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

53.87 55.78 A: mhm 

57.82 58.67 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

58.02 64.89 B: ah i think that excessively drinking would probably be more detrimental to someone 

65.88 70.65 B: wh- you know life in all aspects um you know than like gossiping 

70.56 71.56 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

70.66 72.89 B: or you know something like that i'd um 

73.05 78.69 B: and i don't i don't think gossiping's going to kill someone but drinking a lot definitely could or 

78.45 80.23 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

78.72 82.27 B: you could kill someone else if you're driving or something like that 

81.47 85.16 A: right exactly alcohol and drinking is more 

85.85 90.95 A: you know causes more damage in the long run i believe even over smoking so 

91.37 93.07 A: that's why i pick that 

91.78 92.76 B: um 

93.53 96.29 B: yeah i think ah if um 

98.38 108.91 B: um a- yeah it it well i wouldn't i don't have the medical background to to know what you were more likely to get first emphysema or like 

109.42 112.53 B: ah some sort of liver disease but um 

113.55 117.59 B: i just think that all the all the effects um 

115.75 117.54 A: [noise] 

117.80 121.50 B: i mean you know when someone's at a party if they're drinking 

119.59 120.39 A: mhm 

122.35 132.45 B: i mean you can smoke too much and maybe it's annoying to someone else but ye- you're not going to have an adverse effect on someone else whereas if you're drinking too much 

132.24 140.76 B: and you're one of like those rowdy drinkers you could end up in a fight or if you even in your driving you could get in a car accident and you could kill someone 

140.78 141.89 B: um 

142.05 144.50 B: whereas with smoking it it's 

144.72 150.35 B: it's a more long term effect like if y- you know you're if you're going to get emphysema it's going to be later on 

150.30 151.26 A: mhm 

150.43 155.13 B: um whereas drinking i think you could you know you could end it all in one night 

154.89 160.91 A: right and i had that same type of idea in my mind as well i agree with you one hundred percent [laughter] 

161.17 165.83 B: um do you have um like any personal experiences with it or 

165.60 170.41 A: no i don't do any of them [laughter] so i really don't [laughter] 

168.53 170.74 B: [laughter] 

170.90 173.58 A: i guess that's a good thing right [laughter] 

171.03 172.34 B: i don't know 

172.83 181.17 B: it's a very good thing i i don't smoke um i think it's ah band in ah in in smoking in in new york it's the greatest thing that they could have ever done 

173.60 174.70 A: [laughter] 

180.32 182.09 A: [noise] i agree 

181.54 185.61 B: um i actually think that people will actually go out more 

185.67 192.64 B: i- i- that now that there're i know would because i hate all this smell and everything in my hair but 

187.99 189.46 A: (( i would too [noise] )) 

192.60 206.20 B: for alcoholism i know that my ah my younger brother who's two years younger than i am has had an enormous problem and so it affects our family directly because you know it's 

206.17 216.00 B: it's being pulled over for d._u._i. and and thank god he's never ever been injured and he's been in so many car accidents and he's never injured anyone else 

214.84 216.59 A: (( [noise] [noise] oh good [noise] [noise] )) 

216.01 219.64 B: but it it just i mean it it's 

219.65 230.32 B: the fees and and legal fees and just all sorts of things my parents have paid is unreal um the amount of cars that he's totalled is [laughter] unreal 

229.00 230.65 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

230.27 234.82 B: um like it it's just it takes a horrible toll i mean just this morning 

234.88 236.82 B: i was speaking to my mom 

237.08 247.64 B: and you know sh- th- th- both my parents are in like a frenzy and i mean right now is is he really d- is he fine he's fine right now but that's the thing with alcoholism the 

247.69 251.02 B: the tr- the effects are are long term ah 

250.48 251.66 A: (( [noise] right )) 

250.95 254.24 B: i mean you have one car accident and y- 

254.08 266.77 B: you know court is like two months from now and it you know things are pending and it it so it's not something that you can just fix over night even if it was just a one night thing you know and um 

265.23 267.12 A: mhm [noise] 

266.81 276.34 B: and i- in i i don't know some people say it's a disease some people say it's not um i think a lot of it is just you know your will power in getting things in order 

276.35 277.38 B: um 

278.10 282.66 B: so we definitely had a first hand ah experience with it and ah 

282.92 285.64 B: much more detrimental than um 

286.93 295.01 B: than if they would have had i think drug use as one of the um examples maybe i think i would have chosen that first 

290.98 292.02 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

294.37 297.49 A: me too definitely definitely i would as well 

297.55 300.39 A: especially with it being illegal you know 

299.78 303.31 B: right [laughter] 

300.61 305.29 A: [laughter] that would make sense [laughter] but [noise] 

304.53 307.26 B: (( that would absolutely make sense to um )) 

307.53 309.60 B: because i think that um 

310.26 313.93 B: that with drug use then you it it enters your body even 

314.16 318.03 B: ah quicker than thank i think alcohol 

318.32 323.79 B: um i don't know personally i even i i socially drink and usually i drink wine 

323.45 324.53 A: mhm 

323.89 325.03 B: (( um )) 

325.11 329.57 B: and i can't i can't mix red and white because i automatically get a headache 

329.60 335.27 B: and i can only have one to two glasses and then i'm a goner i'm a very bad drinker [laughter] 

333.86 336.18 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] oh [laughter] )) 

335.83 338.62 B: i'm a very very bad drinker and um 

338.74 345.89 B: and i've never ever tried drugs ah in my life i think i just can't stand the smell i can't [laughter] 

344.79 351.62 A: i never did either only because i had i just don't want to i know it's wrong and bad and [noise] i never did them [noise] 

350.30 354.02 B: it's wrong it's bad yeah right it's um 

354.43 364.14 B: y- you don't know i i just to me it just sounds a little absurd like this is something that's about you know chemically altering my body why in god's name would i want to do this [laughter] 

363.48 368.64 A: exactly i agree with you one hundred percent i do [laughter] i'm the same way 

366.46 370.03 B: [laughter] how ah how old are you if you don't mind me asking 

369.08 370.71 A: i'm twenty seven 

370.75 372.74 B: oh i'm twenty five 

372.59 374.48 A: oh okay [laughter] 

372.83 373.85 B: um 

373.99 376.68 B: it's it's it's strange though um 

376.53 382.01 B: i think for people our age to to think the way we do i think most peop- i usually find that i'm 

381.87 396.06 B: in the minority of it ah i have had friends you know one of my best friends i think has snorted everything up her nose that is like known to man and and we're very good friends but she knows to keep that away from me because i will 

382.80 384.14 A: m- me too mm 

396.17 398.88 B: always frown upon it and i'm like you know what 

398.90 402.43 B: it's your body you do what you want to do but don't do it around me [laughter] 

402.09 403.41 A: yeah i know 

403.46 412.96 A: i can't stand that luckily i'm lucky i have a boyfriend that doesn't do that or and most of my friends now i mean when i was younger they did but the friends i'm with now they don't so 

413.15 414.86 A: i'm lucky [laughter] 

416.25 417.61 B: that's um 

419.34 423.82 B: both agreeing [laughter] i guess we both agree on our ah 

420.55 421.58 A: (( mm huh )) 

423.03 428.16 A: yeah that would be i heard you were watching american idol too 

426.03 426.85 B: (( that we're )) 

428.35 429.69 B: [laughter] 

428.76 431.31 A: i heard it in your background 

430.67 435.79 B: i ah i don't know i just i had the music on i i was watching it when i was eating um 

434.65 435.87 A: (( oh oh )) 

436.14 442.86 B: and i'm i'm actually doing a final ah for a a class that i'm taking and so i ah 

442.94 444.66 B: (( that's what i was doing it's )) 

444.05 448.74 A: (( because we were watching it [laughter] who's calling well that's good )) 

447.53 449.42 B: it's good you seem well 

449.17 449.85 A: (( mm )) 

450.21 457.26 A: yeah but that's good that you know we both have the same feelings about it and there's no big debate going on here [laughter] 

456.97 466.78 B: [laughter] well it's interesting to know that other people think ah you know think the same things like i said i would think that someone similar to my age group would 

457.94 459.00 A: but i 

466.99 469.04 B: probably think 

469.08 470.01 B: (( ah )) 

470.05 476.80 B: opposite because i know i- in um i work in the in the finance industry and it's very 

470.99 471.88 A: mhm 

476.75 482.75 B: common for after work for people to go out for drinks like thursday's a big thing to go out 

482.34 483.17 A: mhm 

482.64 497.11 B: and um and it's not for me to me i can thursdays i still have to go to work on friday and i i have gone out on thursdays and i have gone drinking out on thursdays and i feel horrible the next day and i'm like why did i do that 

488.71 489.72 A: right 

495.36 497.34 A: mhm 

496.88 498.73 B: why do other people do it [laughter] 

498.49 499.80 A: mhm 

499.15 511.40 B: i i can't function properly at work the next day and i just don't unders- i i did it a couple of times and t- i said i wouldn't i'm not doing that to myself i j- i just i'm sick all day the next day 

511.46 518.32 B: um but it's very common and i think most of the time people their reaction to me is 

519.40 528.72 B: i don't know like i'm always the oddball like i'm always the third wheel because i don't want to go out drinking ah 

521.22 522.06 A: mhm 

528.76 535.20 B: with people and and when i and when i say no it's because i know that they're the type of people that are going to go and do it excessively 

535.14 535.99 A: right 

535.31 536.32 B: um 

536.44 548.86 B: if i knew that they just meant they were going to go have a glass of wine i i could join them but i know that that's not what they're in for you know they're out for um you know h- how many drinks can they have in in one night so 

541.63 542.69 A: mhm 

549.28 552.87 B: um and another aspect is i- is financially 

553.10 554.52 A: yeah that too 

554.82 557.84 B: it it could absolutely ruin someone 

557.99 560.22 A: that too yeah definitely 

560.71 562.56 B: my roommate um 

563.00 564.05 B: is 

564.42 567.39 B: priorities are in absolutely disarray 

567.69 569.17 B: and um 

569.74 579.74 B: i'm actually supposed to be moving this coming weekend and that is one of the main main reasons because she never pays rent on time and it's directly 

579.75 581.03 B: because 

581.42 583.56 B: of her social life and her drinking 

583.46 584.58 A: wow 

583.68 592.07 B: if she's going to go out with her friends and i have n- she c- she can really drink someone under the table um 

592.85 596.99 B: she's going to go and she's like she's not here tonight she's going to go out 

597.18 599.23 B: whether rent gets paid or not 

598.93 599.89 A: mhm
