8.84 10.28 B: hi how are you 

10.10 12.26 A: i am fine how are you

18.23 19.51 A: (( [laughter] a- )) 

20.12 24.76 A: what is your choice about all these unhealthy choices what do what do you feel is worse 

24.38 29.55 B: um actually i didn't really hear clearly it's ah recording is kind of some um awful 

28.93 30.44 A: (( okay )) 

29.81 35.79 B: like which is the worst was gossiping smoking drinking and excessive c- excessive caffeine 

36.07 41.21 A: that i believe that that's basically it that's the the most important ones 

41.51 43.19 B: how's it 

42.30 44.65 A: [laughter] you you've you've got you've got most of them 

45.03 48.46 B: um okay so from those i say 

49.61 55.15 B: well it depends because gossiping would be kind of bad but if then you talk about health wise i would say smoking 

55.52 70.39 A: i agree with you i think that although all the choices are unhealthy i think if if i'm forced to make a s- choice like i am now i think it would be alcohol because it does two things it causes social unrest ah you know 

69.53 71.01 B: oh yeah and health 

71.05 73.50 A: and health it causes liver disease 

73.58 75.03 B: right 

75.18 79.06 B: [mn] well is it just like in general 

79.58 81.89 B: like which is the worst in general 

81.65 82.32 A: (( uh-huh )) 

82.47 83.47 B: um 

83.56 85.66 B: i agree with you the alcohol 

85.57 86.79 A: well you know what 

85.99 89.92 B: 'cause it affects m- it affects more than just one category 

89.31 90.93 A: yes yes 

92.01 100.38 A: um i i feel that gossiping it can be it depends on how you look at it because let's face it there's always people who will listen to gossip 

100.46 109.49 B: yeah right they could hurt a person's reputation they also can endanger someone's life if you gossip so it it goes on many levels 

101.16 102.16 A: and gossip 

103.89 104.67 A: yes 

109.28 115.83 A: you know i i believe that with alcoholism i could be wrong but i believe that with alcoholism it's like 

115.88 127.04 A: [mn] a double barrel gun in other words you're causing i don't mean you personally but the person that drinks i don't drink myself but the person that drinks they're causing um 

121.01 122.14 B: (( yeah )) 

127.34 132.24 A: even a possible danger for other people as well as endangering themselves for just drunk driving 

132.29 135.43 B: yeah i would have to say that for drink drinking and driving 

136.70 141.35 A: i i wish i wish that with the choice drunk driving [laughter] 

141.25 143.12 B: (( ah excuse me )) 

142.58 146.11 A: i wish that was one of the choices that would probably win out you know 

145.56 148.24 B: yeah that that would have been a lot better 

148.50 158.96 A: you know um you know what what i find very distressful is that there's such a a social acceptance of alcohol you can even go to a ball game or bowling and there's always liquor available 

149.34 150.51 B: (( yeah )) 

158.84 164.16 B: yeah that's the thing those are the places where a lot of ah fights break out too are ball games 

164.84 174.88 B: a lot of riots and stuff [noise] it's like recently i remember on the news that ah a fan ran into the field and beat up the first base umpire 

174.78 178.05 A: i read that i read that in the new york post 

177.65 181.64 B: right it was i forgot because he didn't like the call 

183.06 186.82 B: and i was like wow that's a huge fan he's a tough fan 

186.92 187.88 A: (( [noise] and are you )) 

187.05 190.77 B: i'm not trying to be wrong or anything but that is kind of crazy 

190.61 195.27 A: well have you noticed there's always been a strong connection at least in american culture between 

195.34 201.13 A: um sports and and drinking it's supposed both are supposed to be acceptable for macho men 

201.41 202.75 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

202.82 205.08 B: it happens in for a lot of occasions 

205.16 205.79 A: (( hm yes )) 

205.59 210.02 B: like for certain things where people are considered like not normal unless you drink 

211.39 213.30 B: it's al- it's almost like ah 

213.65 221.09 B: like ah the smoking ban in bars people like oh what's go into a bar if you can't smoke and drink at the same time 

220.49 230.40 A: i know and people are starting to get summonses do you know what the latest thing with smoking here in new york ah a- the latest thing is if you own a restaurant 

226.50 227.34 B: yeah 

230.44 231.54 A: or a bar 

231.44 232.37 B: right 

231.76 241.50 A: and your customer smokes now you cannot be on top of everybody at the same time you have to run the place but it said in the newspaper that if you are let's say a restaurant owner 

236.29 237.35 B: exactly 

238.11 239.12 B: yeah 

241.62 242.42 B: right 

241.86 249.48 A: and um somebody lights up a cigarette and if a cop if a cop comes in you can get jail time the owner 

244.65 246.47 B: (( you have to tell him to put it out )) 

250.30 251.48 B: really 

250.88 251.68 A: uh-huh 

251.60 254.19 B: (( i didn't know it's jail time i thought it was just a summons )) 

254.07 255.07 A: well in 

254.32 256.65 B: i don't don't they get like three warnings 

256.85 258.58 A: well um 

258.08 259.69 B: they changed it 

259.14 264.17 A: i i you know you could be correct but i did read something about jail time but i don't know how soon 

264.44 265.69 B: oh [laughter] 

264.46 266.57 A: maybe it is three strikes and you're out 

266.36 272.40 B: yeah 'cause i remember that's how it was for the restaurants when they first did the ban but that one makes more sense than a bar ban 

273.43 277.82 A: but i think that they're going too far that they're going to far overboard 

276.41 281.77 B: yeah yeah well i guess it is in the citizens' good nature 

281.76 282.74 A: (( but you know )) 

282.48 284.08 B: like people's good nature 

283.73 288.02 A: you know human nature the the more they say the more something is taboo the more people will 

287.22 290.08 B: yeah 'cause people tend to break rules 

288.20 289.28 A: do it 

289.92 290.77 A: yeah 

291.10 292.21 A: that's actually 

291.50 293.94 B: that people are it's like little kids 

294.20 295.15 A: (( yeah )) 

294.23 297.28 B: it's like i'll do this and they just 

296.70 301.74 A: yeah yeah and and you know um i i i know there are restaurants in um 

301.81 303.16 A: smoking in brooklyn 

303.12 317.10 A: where they set aside special rooms that and they they have barrier they have door barriers so that if people smoke the smoke doesn't get to the other people and the other and the other rooms and there's been no problem with that but now i don't even know if they'll allow that 

318.40 324.21 B: oh that's a good question actually yeah i i'm not a smoker but um that's a good question [laughter] 

323.99 327.52 A: i think you're correct though about the three strikes and you're out i think i was wrong 

324.50 325.11 B: (( ah )) 

327.79 332.54 A: um i think they give you three three like three summonses or three inspections or something like that 

332.19 339.59 B: oh yeah i'm not sure i i i don't really go out and ah like i'm not a big smoker or anything like that 

339.60 341.08 B: (( [laughter] )) 

340.43 345.21 A: i know i used to smoke but the problem was when i was um i started at age twelve 

345.27 346.06 B: oh 

345.88 352.08 A: and um well i'm i'm fifty one now but [laughter] but the thing is by the time i reached my thirties i couldn't breath anymore 

352.05 355.40 B: oh i see so you're quite right yeah

493.93 503.33 B: [laughter] yeah it has but i'm exposed to it so i don't know i guess i got kind of used to everything but i i i still know it's reality 

500.98 501.85 A: (( never )) 

502.77 506.61 A: oh you know i never thought that that asians had had such a high um 

506.64 509.57 A: ah drinking ah drinking a- ah 

509.66 513.46 A: drinking um tradition i know the russians are terrible 

511.82 512.57 B: oh 

512.84 517.07 B: [mn] if you go to some chinese restaurants they will ah like like 

517.15 525.43 B: like big togethers they'll bring out like several just for like ten people to bring out at least like four or five bottles of cognac 

524.90 526.06 A: oh my gosh 

525.50 528.29 B: up they'll drink it out straight up straight out 

527.83 532.33 A: it would you say that the chinese people in general have a high degree of alcoholism 

532.93 537.35 B: ah well i wouldn't say alcoholism 'cause i haven't really seen many drunk 

537.36 541.24 B: asian people but i know asian people tend to have a really high tolerance 

541.67 550.16 A: well tolerance is i guess tolerance is good in a sense because at least a- you know it does at least they're acting civilized but i bet you their liver doesn't tolerate it 

547.96 548.71 B: yeah 

550.59 557.64 B: ah well i guess you can say that but i don't know i see like sixty seventy year old men that still drink and smoke 

556.70 558.36 A: (( [laughter] oh god [laughter] )) 

557.76 562.36 B: [laughter] so it's either they're very extremely fortunate or 

562.37 565.40 B: i don't know they got lots of livers or something [laughter] 

564.71 571.63 A: [laughter] but you know there could be a genetic predisposition towards fighting the ah the effects of alcoholism you never know 

569.74 570.31 B: (( [mn] )) 

571.67 583.91 B: it could be that but i i think it also has to do with ah like the as- the chinese people um the asians always drink tea they drink a lot of soup and herbs and everything so it kind of and and the chinese medicine 

580.63 581.57 A: oh 

583.47 585.06 A: like an antitoxin 

585.58 590.38 B: you could say that oh 'cause there's a lot of chinese medicine that's not legalized in america 

590.07 590.94 A: (( oh mm )) 

590.61 598.55 B: but you know a lot of the chinese people still use them anyway 'cause it's we know that it works because it's been around for centuries 

598.61 599.89 B: it's just not legalized
