31.63 34.57 A: met a couple of lives who've been extremely damaged by it i'm 

34.92 37.65 A: trying to remember what some of the other options were 

37.40 38.58 B: (( yes right yeah oh )) 

37.90 39.21 A: overeating 

39.08 40.78 B: yeah gossiping 

40.21 42.32 A: gossiping hm 

41.31 43.71 B: i can relate to overeating but

47.00 48.71 B: yeah 

47.25 51.35 A: it um not exercising well i guess 

52.46 56.55 A: i don't know the worst i mean i think it's so individual it's like 

57.88 65.71 B: well the worst out of all the categories that they say is bad was um drinking and smoking 

61.84 63.26 A: mhm 

65.38 66.30 A: yeah 

66.28 67.78 B: yeah 

67.22 68.61 A: (( oh it can ))

70.14 71.66 B: yeah [laughter] 

71.07 77.80 A: i don't know i it just it i mean it seems it seems very individual to me 'cause i can think of a person who can go out and you know i guess 

78.17 83.62 A: light up the town one night and you know not have any issues with it and then somebody else who 

84.11 92.17 A: there is a different personality or background or whatever and obviously will continue down a spiral but that's the same thing with 

87.69 88.40 B: (( yeah w- )) 

92.30 96.37 A: (( overeating or smoking or any of these horrendous of habits i guess it's )) 

96.29 97.67 B: yeah

101.00 101.59 B: (( mm )) 

101.33 105.67 A: try not to go too far down one path maybe but yeah i guess i guess um 

106.67 109.52 A: let's see what can gossiping do mm 

109.72 114.28 B: gossiping it could lead to misunderstandings um 

114.56 116.78 B: it's not really you know 

117.21 118.28 B: (( i don't know )) 

119.23 123.03 B: it can be compared to smoking or drinking or you know 

122.77 123.64 A: yeah 

123.67 127.43 A: i'd say you could pretty much ruin somebody's life i mean depending on 

127.86 132.13 A: what kind of community you live in or what kind of gossip it is or 

132.38 136.23 A: i'm thinking of a case that was on the news tonight about a teacher who has been 

136.63 139.13 A: accused of um 

139.25 140.04 A: (( you know )) 

140.80 146.77 A: inappropriate contact with students that kind of gossip could certainly do some serious damage 

146.49 152.42 B: yeah and ruin a person's like career and stuff like that 

151.81 154.29 A: definitely home life everything 

154.11 155.17 B: yeah 

158.04 162.59 B: that's one example of how gossiping could ruin a person's life 

162.47 170.23 A: um mm mm how about drinking excessive caffeine [laughter] trying to turn that into something evil but i'm having a hard time probably because that's like my vice so 

165.64 166.20 B: (( [mn] )) 

169.51 172.26 B: [laughter] don't say that 

171.65 173.91 A: [laughter] 

172.60 176.50 B: [laughter] that's my life no i'm more 

175.91 182.66 A: it's my vice [laughter] i don't smoke i don't drink i i don't know i suppose i gossip a little bit but nothing too extreme 

177.79 178.78 B: (( yeah right )) 

182.61 188.08 B: but i don't think dri- ah drinking caffeine excessively i mean coffee well 

188.28 193.50 B: i don't know in my opinion it's not as bad as the other you know 

193.16 194.62 A: yeah 

194.25 195.01 B: (( things ah )) 

195.11 200.21 A: yeah that's true of course you know twenty years down the line who knows who knows what the medical establishment will say 

200.84 203.44 B: everything according to them causes cancer 

203.05 210.55 A: [laughter] and on the other hand everything cures cancer too so you gotten in your glass of red wine [laughter]
