196.94 197.96 B: yeah 

197.25 198.99 A: you know for money 

198.69 201.60 B: 'cause you have to vote other people off to stay on 

201.98 204.64 A: and that who wants to marry a millionaire 

204.91 206.41 B: that was a long time ago 

205.25 209.06 A: you know why people e- everybody wanna marry somebody with money [mn] 

210.02 211.84 A: so that show you know 

211.36 212.89 B: and joe millionaire too 

213.41 214.92 A: oh joe the millionaire 

214.53 216.22 B: joe millionaire too was similar 

216.34 223.65 A: oh okay similar to that well they making all these reality shows is ah like one started and everybody started the same trend 

223.31 224.54 B: yeah 

223.68 228.23 A: you know it's like now you can't get rid of the reality shows now they just making up more and more 

226.34 227.65 B: now it's overload 

228.50 229.81 B: yeah it's overload 

229.55 235.38 A: yeah but they just copy off the you know what they see somebody else do well i guess anything to make money right 

234.73 240.12 B: [laughter] but i guess it makes everyone else's own life look so look better [laughter] when you're seeing all these people [laughter] [mn] 

238.69 240.82 A: yeah that's true too 

241.13 242.54 A: that's definitely true 

242.78 246.42 B: especially like [mn] some of the people on the bachelor and the bachelorette 

246.22 247.15 A: mhm 

248.00 251.02 B: yeah i don't know they don't i don't think i would ever 

251.13 252.82 B: be friends with any of those people 

252.84 255.09 B: but it's interesting to watch them all on television 

254.82 255.95 A: yes 

256.16 258.92 A: yes it is it is and see how people you know 

259.82 264.29 A: really react i mean you know you know i wonder if they acting that's like because they on t._v. 

264.34 266.46 A: or this is how they normally act 

266.18 267.37 B: yeah seriously 

267.03 274.99 A: and most of them really normally act that w- the way they act that's why i like the road rules 'cause it's like so real people you know the people are themselves 

269.71 270.55 B: i know 

274.41 275.73 B: mhm 

276.26 283.67 A: and i like to see people be they selves you know you express your mind whether you right or wrong you still express yourself you know you don't hold back there because [mn] 

284.40 287.79 A: um samantha there or whatever you know you're just being yourself 

287.35 288.39 B: mhm 

287.89 291.90 A: so if everybody be they self like some people have not been exposed around white people 

292.15 294.87 A: and some people have not been exposed around black people 

295.43 297.57 A: so but i know this you know like 

298.05 300.59 A: race is always a thing to come up 

299.96 300.78 B: (( [mn] ahah )) 

300.78 301.78 A: you know 

301.81 303.01 A: sometimes 

302.72 309.15 B: [mn] but didn't they come from didn't they come from the r- like where did they come from that they weren't i don't understand 

309.70 313.73 B: 'cause isn't isn't it the road are you talking specifically about 

312.44 315.65 A: yeah people pick they pick someone to come on the show 

315.15 316.03 B: okay 

316.08 319.99 B: i thought you were specifically talking about um real world road rules like the challenge 

319.77 325.49 A: yeah yeah th- they have that too they go like um they pick people from all over the world 

325.66 328.00 A: like say a thousand people went 

328.42 330.17 A: for that um interview 

330.49 331.38 B: mhm 

330.80 333.82 A: about a thousand people they don't pick the people who they want to be on the show 

335.12 338.83 A: so it always be mixed you know what i'm saying a little bit of everything on the show 

335.12 336.15 B: okay 

338.59 340.42 B: yeah 

339.61 342.92 A: you know you have your blacks you have your whites you have your hispanic 

343.40 344.32 A: (( you know )) 

343.46 348.11 B: and and m._t._v. probably picks the most controversial people that they can i'm sure 

347.88 349.00 A: (( yeah )) 

349.12 353.56 A: so i really i really like the show they they um i like most of the reality shows 

354.51 357.45 A: you know give me something to look at give me something to do you 

357.16 361.47 B: yeah [laughter] i guess it makes everyone's life seem a little better too [laughter]

406.44 407.53 A: mhm 

406.91 410.71 B: and i think that's another reason why people watch it because everyone's talking about it 

410.73 413.75 A: yeah and you know it's exposure you know what i'm saying 

413.55 414.31 B: mhm 

413.79 415.56 A: once they get the exposure 

416.08 419.83 A: then you know i- i- it it becomes it becomes a hit 

420.05 420.83 B: yeah 

420.43 431.52 A: i- it becomes a trend that everyone follows now everybody like those kinda shows 'cause the more you see it the more you gonna wanna watch it especially if they have some juicy stuff in it you're like i can't watch it next week 

422.85 424.06 B: and and 

427.62 428.48 B: (( yeah and they )) 

431.32 433.42 B: if there's controversy exactly

436.85 438.45 B: like jerry springer these have re- 

437.30 439.37 A: (( like jer- jerry springer )) 

439.01 442.99 B: yeah these have replaced him i would think i think they're more popular 

441.79 446.21 A: his his shows still come on i think his his show's garbage to me 

446.13 448.93 B: i think that's more staged than the reality shows 

449.52 452.32 B: [lipsmack] i i think reality shows are more real than him 

452.33 454.89 A: yes yes his show's a fake 

455.11 458.29 A: his his show is not i don't think his show is a reality show 

457.88 461.52 B: no now we know what real- reality is no one watches him any more [mn] 

460.82 461.77 A: yes 

462.81 464.95 A: (( but i wish i could be in a reality show )) 

464.82 467.17 B: (( [laughter] i don't know any one [mn] talking about )) 

466.10 471.43 A: see just to see how i'll act you know being on a camera you know will 

471.57 474.28 A: i really be myself can i really be myself 

474.46 482.24 A: you know knowing that the camera's on me all the time 'cause you know they'd be laying up on the bed having sex and they'd be talking about each o- [laughter] 

481.41 482.19 B: (( each other )) 

482.47 487.48 A: yeah so you wanna get to see how two faced the people really are on reality shows 

482.91 484.18 B: it's crazy 

488.26 489.36 B: yeah 

488.95 491.41 A: (( you know start talking it's a lot of )) 

491.43 496.82 A: ah controversy you know and then you have some on this side and then some are on the other side 

497.17 498.49 B: [mn] [mn] yeah and you also 

497.64 500.61 A: and then you know you've got to vote people off the show and 

499.92 501.40 B: [laughter] 

500.72 502.39 A: that's when it becomes back 

504.85 507.29 A: stabbing there's somebody on my other line and i can't answer 

507.19 508.82 B: oh yeah it will disconnect you 

508.39 513.13 A: it yeah i c- i can't answer it ah i thought [mn] 

511.01 512.19 B: [laughter] 

513.68 516.72 A: it seems like ten minutes is up already right [laughter] 

515.66 519.55 B: i think it's been like um i think we have a few ah like another minute 

519.18 520.25 A: (( oh okay )) 

520.49 521.90 A: yeah so 

522.53 526.18 B: [mn] but i don't even know if people are really acting like they do on these shows 

526.52 527.62 B: you don't know how m- 

528.48 531.30 B: [mn] i don't know if it if it shows them how they really are 

531.85 533.90 A: yeah some of them show how they really are 

533.76 543.57 B: [mn] well i i know that they do but i'm wondering if people are acting for benefit of the camera [mn] 'cause they all want to be on t._v. eventually when it's over so you're wondering if maybe they're doing more than they normally would 

539.13 540.31 A: yeah 

544.44 552.32 A: on the rally o- o- o- on ah road rules rules it all seems too real to me it don't seem like it don't seem like they acting in front of the camera or anything 

552.09 556.07 B: [mn] also now on real world they have to get a job or something too so that's kinda 

557.43 561.33 B: i liked it better before when they didn't they could all just like sit around 

560.80 562.64 A: mhm 

563.96 566.40 B: [mn] but now they have to actually work somewhere i think 

566.50 568.48 A: yeah they go like different places 

568.44 571.30 B: yeah they have like challenges and things which is weird [mn] [mn] 

569.87 576.45 A: yes yes and you know you gotta win money for your team or they had the um the men against the women 

576.71 580.61 A: that's what i like about road rules i mean i used to watch it every day 

580.64 583.96 A: i'm watching it i miss it now because they don't have the new one 

581.60 582.42 B: [laughter] 

583.93 585.02 B: oh 

584.43 587.84 A: like they'd be in vegas they'd be in chicago 

587.90 591.07 A: (( they'd be all over the world some of them would be on a ship )) 

592.12 593.39 B: mhm 

592.41 594.77 A: and you get to really travel all over the world 

594.50 596.23 B: yeah it's been all over the place 

596.01 598.88 A: and then some go to ah the family's house 

598.58 599.60 B: mhm
