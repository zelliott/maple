138.75 142.87 B: really and i i don't know does the bachelor count as a reality show 

142.67 144.33 A: i'm sure it does 

143.73 153.09 B: yeah okay and i'm currently watching that one 'cause everyone that i work with is watching that one so you know everybody talks about it like constantly 

151.47 152.47 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

153.04 160.32 B: and um i don't i guess the lure with watching i don't know what's the what's the lure of the reality show 

158.69 170.77 A: you know what it it is i think this is going to be just like a a phase or a fad i mean and uh you know people will get tired of it real soon 'cause it's been just so much different than whatever has been on t._v. you know 

170.25 171.23 B: right 

170.81 182.32 A: some of these sitcoms are pretty bad you know and just looking for something and even you know if if you're not into the drama shows which i'm not either you know like that one uh what's that one with the president 

175.43 176.48 B: different 

178.34 179.52 B: right 

182.23 186.24 B: oh right um like the ov- oval office or like 

184.83 187.11 A: (( um the oval office or whatever )) 

186.52 187.94 B: something like that 

187.24 189.76 A: yeah the yeah i don't get into that either so 

188.96 191.15 B: me neither yeah i don't 

190.11 192.46 A: i just get into david letterman [laughter] 

192.14 202.53 B: i yeah i don't stay up that late so i don't watch any of that stuff either and he i i think i used to i think when i used to watch t._v. every once in a while at like friends' houses 

194.73 195.90 A: (( oh really yeah )) 

202.37 211.76 B: i would watch like letterman and he slowly like started getting less funny over the years so i that's what i've heard anyway so um 

208.05 209.03 A: uh-huh 

210.77 213.03 A: uh you just you gotta grow with them you know 

212.90 222.23 B: well yeah exactly and and um i think that the interest in reality shows for me was just that it was also yeah it was something different i never had heard of it 

214.91 215.89 A: and uh 

222.06 231.95 B: and i think there was also a psychological like idea that you could put yourself in the shoes of the person that was on the show and kind of psychologically it would 

229.96 230.91 A: uh-huh 

231.81 240.07 B: it would um a lot of the part of television that i know myself and my boyfriend are into is like the fantasy and the escape of television 

240.01 253.08 B: and the idea that you could put yourself in the shoes of the people that are in it and kind of get away for a while i mean i guess that's the whole psychological background of the idea of the reality shows 

240.03 241.02 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

247.70 248.78 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

250.00 250.83 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

251.94 257.81 A: it could be you know what so come to think of it the the i do get hooked on sometimes is the ones where they gotta do 

257.83 260.26 A: [noise] that eat like eat bugs and stuff uh-huh 

259.43 262.17 B: oh yeah we watched that fear factor 

261.71 263.24 A: (( fear factor fear factor )) 

262.51 268.22 B: we love fear factor we love it i mean actually i'm starting to hate it 

264.04 265.20 A: (( [laughter] it )) 

266.12 272.15 A: gets too gory sometimes i gotta the change the channel after after three people eat bugs or 

272.19 275.26 A: or cow blood or i don't know what [laughter] 

274.21 276.32 B: right well yeah i mean 

275.46 276.90 A: that's enough 

276.32 282.52 B: i really i really like it but there's i don't know because i've actually had to like live in other countries 

282.32 283.11 A: mhm 

282.38 295.39 B: and and live in circumstances where i've actually had to like do that for a cer- like actually live in real survival circumstances sometimes i don't like shows like that because it's like why would you put yourself through that trauma 

289.17 290.51 A: oh yeah 

294.97 296.02 A: mhm 

295.39 302.42 B: just for like the chance to win a negligible amount of money that you could just go work and get the money for 

302.02 308.18 A: right well you know what the celebrities do it for for charity usually or they say they do 

302.62 304.54 B: for me i just it doesn't 

306.25 314.29 B: well right right i gu- i guess i can kinda understand that but the whole celebrity one they did their stunts were ridiculous 

314.27 327.09 B: like and when i when i watch those shows right basically i don't even really watch those shows like my boyfriend will sit there and actually pay attention to them and and like get into them i don't know how he can do it without losing his brain 

316.92 317.91 A: (( mhm )) 

324.39 325.32 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

326.97 341.00 B: matter but like i actually sit there and i'll like do like send my bills and like clean my apartment and like play with my cat like i i do multi-tasking whenever i watch those shows so my brain's kind of like elsewhere 

340.26 347.65 A: mhm yeah i guess that's the you know i work in my in my house so i have a home office and i got the little t._v. there and um 

347.69 355.52 A: or the big t._v. if i'm working in the living room and um yeah i'll just have something on like that it'll catch my eye but usually not reality shows [laughter] 

354.64 358.07 B: but aren't you hoping like it ends at this point 

357.69 359.63 A: yeah definitely 

359.29 362.01 B: but there's no good t- i mean and now it just seems like 

360.85 363.48 A: we need another we need another seinfeld 

363.12 367.70 B: oh my gosh you're so correct i've i mean that is like my favorite show 

367.75 373.37 B: and unfortunately i never seem 'cause i also just didn't have television and i never seemed to get it 

368.01 368.80 A: yeah 

371.92 372.94 A: mhm 

373.51 380.79 B: my problem is that i never got in into on anything at the right time like i never enjoyed seinfeld like when it was popular 

377.47 378.37 A: oh yeah 

380.45 381.52 A: (( mhm )) 

380.84 385.89 B: but you know how when it was in syndication and it still is that's when i got into it 

383.82 384.70 A: right 

385.54 386.74 A: oh really 

386.11 391.29 B: yeah and then i was then i was like bummed 'cause i was like oh my gosh i have to chase after 

389.52 392.42 A: well at least it's like new new to you so that's 

392.06 395.54 B: yeah but i've seen every episode now at least five times 

392.72 393.56 A: (( good )) 

395.15 396.30 A: [laughter] 

395.57 397.65 B: and it still makes me laugh 

397.33 399.29 A: yeah george kills me [laughter] 

398.35 403.33 B: yeah oh george [laughter] i am george in so many ways 

403.85 417.62 B: [laughter] [laughter] and now i find it sad because there's actually been a couple of shows that like aren't too bad but because they don't seem to make like a billion dollars right away they just take them off after six shows it's like they get their 

410.29 411.26 A: mhm 

416.47 423.92 A: yeah well you know s- seinfeld was like on for like for the first two years without any attention you know it was just barely making it then all of a sudden boom [laughter] 

421.67 422.64 B: right 

423.12 426.54 B: right well like me people like me didn't even know it was on 

426.61 429.29 B: so you know i didn't even get it 

428.15 430.42 A: you were living your own reality 

429.84 436.22 B: well yeah i i was well i was working two jobs and i was in college so for me i was yeah doing other stuff but 

433.64 434.46 A: (( yeah )) 

436.25 447.26 B: yeah you know i guess it i guess it comes down to like the dumbing down of the american public and i just wonder if like they're going to under- i guess i'm wondering if it's going to change i'm hoping it's going to change 

445.91 446.78 A: well 

447.00 453.75 A: you know what they they do have to be continue to be wilder and wilder for people to keep watching you know 

453.43 454.42 B: right 

454.07 455.17 A: and then um 

455.66 457.38 A: 'til it gets out of control 

455.71 461.76 B: well like you notice like they have those ones like um um married did you see married by america 

461.68 464.90 A: y- yeah i c- [mn] barely caught a little bit of one 

464.50 469.50 B: i didn't see that at all and then they had that like um temptation island one 

469.51 472.44 A: yeah i wanted to see that but i never did 

470.41 474.73 B: they have all of those shows where they basically they try to break up like relationships 

474.33 475.75 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

474.93 476.50 B: committed relationships 

476.58 477.51 A: mhm 

476.67 487.29 B: i don't know i just it because i'm in a committed relationship i just don't really value those ones [laughter] it's like just like why are we trying to purposely break up committed relationships at this point 

481.32 482.49 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

487.55 489.96 B: uh that part i don't understand but 

489.96 491.76 A: but those people love it 

489.99 492.86 B: i mean i guess it's yeah people do love it 

493.02 503.24 B: i mean i'm just afraid that we're getting to the point where it's going to be like running man time and we're going to have people just like tearing each other apart for like small c- like premiums 

502.14 503.89 A: yeah remember that 

503.46 504.38 B: what 

504.03 508.81 A: remember that uh that what's that that movie with uh what was it arnold schwarzenegger mhm 

506.19 507.40 B: yeah 

508.19 511.04 B: yeah it's a book by stephen king actually 

510.37 511.88 A: okay yeah yeah 

511.21 514.80 B: and um i'm terrified like because it's something 

513.83 516.64 A: you mean they wrote a they wrote a book on that movie [laughter] 

516.46 517.17 B: [laughter] 

517.11 519.02 A: (( just kidding [laughter] [laughter] )) 

517.14 525.18 B: [laughter] that's funny [laughter] um yeah they did [laughter] like eight years before and um 

522.24 523.40 A: [laughter] 

525.06 532.90 B: i've just that was a book that just changed my life i think i was like eight years old when i read that book yeah and it freaked me out big time 

529.80 530.85 A: oh yeah 

531.98 533.89 A: (( yeah yeah it was pretty freaky mhm )) 

532.96 546.69 B: and um i've seen like our society just take the shape of that book and i'm wondering like yeah when is it going to be that we're like you know paying you know eight year olds to do you know just tear each other apart for like you know an x. box 

546.81 552.03 A: might as well get some lions and throw 'em into the uh colosseum with the 

552.32 554.14 B: [laughter] 

552.82 554.81 A: [laughter] bunch of people [laughter] 

554.31 562.84 B: well i mean and then you know like on survivor i don't know just each successive series gets more boring and more like tragic as the next one 

562.37 564.47 A: really i don't even follow that 

563.73 576.81 B: yeah i don't i don't really like i used to look the first one i would like make sure like every thursday i would either tape it or watch it like i would look forward to it which is weird 'cause i never looked forward or cared about anything 

571.47 572.35 A: uh-huh

579.15 581.94 B: [laughter] 

580.63 583.68 A: [laughter] that's about the only thing i really make a point to watch 

582.97 590.11 B: really the yeah when i went and then when i found out about seinfeld i was like seinfeld oh my god seinfeld's on 

583.89 584.72 A: (( yeah [laughter] ))
