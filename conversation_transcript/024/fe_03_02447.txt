152.56 153.42 A: yeah 

155.83 156.77 B: (( ah )) 

156.97 159.15 B: ah characters were 

157.01 165.95 A: right it's pretty much like the winner is based on you know who puts out more and who is blonder and has bigger boobs that's w- [laughter] 

163.51 170.63 B: ahah well that's not too surprising i guess well i guess those are sort of the reasons why i don't watch much television [laughter] 

169.17 176.81 A: yeah after the first season i was when the girl i wanted to win didn't win because she had morals [mn] i was like i'm not watching this any more

176.22 178.11 B: (( [laughter] ahah )) 

177.86 192.55 A: and then i watched the first season of american [mn] of american idol but when justin guarini didn't win because i thought he was way more talented 'cause i'm i'm a singer and i thought he was way more talented than kelly carson and she won because same reasons why those blondes won 

192.19 193.11 B: yeah 

192.56 196.31 A: because america thought you know she was prettier and all that business and even though j- yeah

197.19 202.09 A: yeah i haven't watched the new season too much my mother's addicted to it though [mn] 

201.23 206.24 B: ahah yeah ah is that would that be considered a reality t._v. show 

202.29 203.65 A: [mn] and 

206.08 211.49 A: yeah i think it's considered reality like it's going on now and america's voting who gets kicked off the island you know 

211.60 212.83 B: (( ahah yeah )) 

212.17 216.78 A: 'cause they are going through all that stuff you have to deal with simon's biting comments 

216.19 219.31 B: oh american idol is one that takes place on an island 

218.71 221.98 A: [mn] no no no that's like an expression like like um 

222.18 229.63 A: like how survivor kicks off on an island and like even like it's on a stage in los angeles but america votes who gets kicked off each week 

229.20 230.79 B: ah yeah yeah okay 

230.22 233.10 A: you know it's just like an expression you know who gets kicked off 

232.72 233.91 B: yeah i gotcha 

233.50 246.97 A: and the other show that i i'm addicted to because my boyfriend watches w._w._e. wrestling i got addicted to w._w._e. tough enough which is a reality show to see who wins and who gets the wrestling professional contract at the end 

246.43 254.09 B: ahah yeah well i guess yeah i guess professional wrestling ah and reality television have something in common 

247.46 249.14 A: and i watch that [mn] 

254.00 255.29 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

254.35 258.66 B: such as a strong emphasis on drama and ah 

255.62 256.18 A: (( [mn] )) 

257.33 267.08 A: right right and i've watched ah real world the only um season that i watched was when they were in hawaii because my roommate in college was really into it so she got me into it 

266.05 269.29 B: is real world one where people live together 

268.77 282.16 A: yeah it was on m._t._v. and they lived together in a house and everybody's stereotyped into whatever character like there's the bitch there's the token you know african american person and there's the token gay person you know that kinda stuff 

281.22 282.84 B: ah yeah yeah 

282.31 283.38 A: [laughter] 

283.45 285.58 B: so ah do you remember

290.86 292.54 A: no i don't know that show 

291.37 305.22 B: mm they it was a ah a show this was probably more than ten years ago and this may have been actually something like the first reality television program it was on public broadcasting system 

301.88 302.81 A: mhm 

304.65 305.70 A: mhm 

305.16 306.95 B: so it was a p._b._s. show

323.51 324.39 A: mhm 

323.97 326.43 B: which was like a big scandal and a shock 

326.06 327.07 A: right

339.59 348.36 B: ah i i don't know if i ever really watched the show but i'm aware of it because of its um

460.73 467.15 A: oh it's just they're very different sects i lived in jerusalem for a year and like we used we like learned about like the different sects of hasidism 

466.94 468.24 B: (( ah ahah )) 

468.84 475.97 A: and that should have been a reality series [laughter] oh god 'cause it was right when um all the all the bombings started to get really bad 

471.45 472.01 B: (( [mn] )) 

474.83 477.32 B: (( um oh ahah that's when you were there )) 

476.73 480.04 A: that's when i was there so it could have been its own reality series [mn] 

477.66 478.59 B: (( ahah )) 

479.89 483.45 B: yeah yeah well i'm sure that's quite an experience ah

500.69 501.63 A: yeah 

501.78 502.60 B: huh 

502.14 515.00 A: and then they sent us home early because this cafe oh you probably heard about this moment cafe right near the prime minister's house um was suicide bombed [mn] and if we we were at this conference 'cause there was a rabbinical convention visiting 

514.77 515.65 B: (( ahah )) 

514.94 520.89 A: and if we weren't at the conference at the hotel right across from my apartment [mn] both of my roommates and a whole like pretty much

524.77 525.73 B: (( oh boy [laughter] ))

533.91 535.10 B: yeah boy 

534.96 536.52 A: yeah it was pretty scary
