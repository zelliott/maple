53.25 59.92 A: i like fear factor um i think i've watched half of an anna nicole i've watched most of the um joe millionaires 

60.02 65.62 A: only because i was at a friend's house he has parties every monday night and so we would watch it at his house 

64.87 66.18 B: so cool 

65.98 67.08 A: um 

67.29 73.92 A: and i i watched it but just for the comedy value you know i certainly didn't think that any of it was for real um 

72.48 74.02 B: right exactly 

74.16 85.33 A: you know and i watched a couple of the um married by america which is just so ridiculous i've never watched survivor i can't just it just doesn't [noise] appeal to me 

79.62 80.69 B: right 

84.86 86.25 B: right exactly 

85.43 93.51 A: um i've watched fear factor you know a few times but mo- most reality shows just do not appeal to me 'cause it's just so 

93.69 94.77 A: (( fake )) 

94.71 100.24 B: r- right exactly that's y- yeah it it seems fake to me too i- totally i mean 

96.12 97.88 A: (( you know it's just like )) 

100.02 109.86 B: you know re- fear factor is kind of like they really can't fake that [laughter] you know so i mean they're really up they're high they're really over water they really you know fall off the helicopters that kind of stuff 

104.19 105.42 A: mhm 

109.03 117.59 A: right you know fear factor yeah you can't fake it it's a really cool stunt show basically that's what it is and it's really cool when you see their um [lipsmack] 

115.33 116.23 B: right 

117.90 121.83 A: when you see the celebrities that do it because they're raising money for charity 

121.20 126.24 B: yes i i've i've seen two of those and those were pretty nice um [mn] 

123.25 124.25 A: yeah 

125.30 130.48 A: i i can't deal with the eating the the squiggly things that are still moving though that yeah 

128.58 135.98 B: i was just going to say the food that they come up with though boy i just can't ew i can't fathom eating any of that stuff [laughter] 

135.12 148.38 A: i've often thought you know i wouldn't mind doing fear factor 'cause i have no problems with like throwing me off a building or you know suspending me from a helicopter or any of that kind of stuff i'm like whatever [noise] cool i'd try it but you want me to eat a cockroach i'm might die 

147.94 153.38 B: yeah right exactly i'd have to give up give up the give up the the challenge at that point yeah 

148.15 151.50 A: [laughter] 

152.69 165.69 A: yeah it's just like sorry i can't do that you know or put my head in a casket full of spiders i'm like no no way on this planet you know i'm sorry that will damage me mentally for the rest of my life [laughter] 

158.70 159.68 B: no 

163.59 171.66 B: right or lie in the [laughter] lie in the coffin of scorpions or whatever that was it's like oh that was just you know scary um some of the 

168.19 169.30 A: right 

170.37 172.00 A: (( yeah so no )) 

171.66 186.23 B: some of the other reality shows that uh that i've just like looked at once or something um you know there there's well there's that new thing on by shannon dougherty called scare tactics that's an interesting one it's not a really a re- well it is kind of reality because 

185.63 187.09 A: i haven't seen that 

186.78 191.29 B: yeah it's on um sci fi i believe sci fi channel 

189.76 191.03 A: oh okay [noise] 

191.10 198.93 B: and uh she hosts it and they they put people in situations and then scare the crap out of 'em basically is what they do 

191.21 192.12 A: yeah 

198.70 207.02 B: um they like an alien abduction a a f- you know a fake uh sasquatch uh big foot that kind of thing situation 

199.81 200.46 A: w- 

205.87 213.16 A: so it's more like a study in w- watching human reactions in in you know different circumstances 

212.46 226.23 B: yeah exactly yeah but they they put people in situations to a point where i just i would be scared to do it as a as a uh a host or as a producer of the show because you know if somebody dies from a heart attack from being scared to death 

224.76 228.13 A: that's yeah that show could backfire on you big time 

227.59 241.30 B: right exactly and and so so i kind of wonder if that's even real after all because why would the producers put themselves in a position where you know a guy could pass out and have a stroke from scaring him so you know from being scared and and 

228.85 230.05 A: (( you know it )) 

240.41 243.31 A: well they most probably get like 'cause you you 

243.28 254.79 A: no doubt you have to get somebody to put them forward right to to volun- [noise] they're mostly friend friends or family that would volunteer this person to do this so they most probably 

247.27 248.48 B: you have to do what 

252.91 254.41 B: y- y- uh yeah they 

254.51 256.07 B: set 'em up right exactly 

254.74 263.84 A: most probably ask like the friends and family do they have any history of you know mental illness [laughter] heart disease you know yeah 

259.87 268.16 B: oh yeah that could be true that might be the w that might be the way they pick 'em you know do they have do they do they pass out from the sight of blood that kind of stuff yeah that might be 

267.09 274.28 A: yeah you know they they most probably have to do some kind of because even when you're on t._v. and y- you're doing nothing you have to sign a disclaimer 

274.04 275.76 B: oh yeah absolutely 

274.50 275.94 A: you know so 

275.81 290.25 A: so therefore you know they they have to sort of do research on the people from their friends and family to find out you know what will affect them what won't affect them and then at the end of the day those people will have to sign a disclaimer to say that they will show that footage they'll allow that footage to be shown 

289.84 298.76 B: yeah i'm sure that there's more people not signing it than there are people signing it though [laughter] you know because people just don't wanna be seen on t._v. being scared to death i don't think 

294.05 295.62 A: (( yeah you know )) 

298.13 302.16 A: yeah crapping their pants it's not a good thing [laughter] 

300.55 304.18 B: no no not really [laughter] 

303.06 308.03 A: [laughter] i never ever did you ever watch a- any of those um big brother shows 

307.87 316.13 B: um actually i did uh watch them last season and i think the s- s- second season that they were on i looked at 'em but i didn't really watch 'em 

316.04 328.60 B: um like for you know like on a regular basis but yeah i have seen those and there's some other ones too like that like those um like real t._v. and real world i mean yeah real world on m._t._v. and and shows like tha- 

318.89 319.84 A: right 

326.75 333.67 A: yeah i saw real world like years ago [noise] when they first starting doing it and i thought it was kind of interesting but i haven't watched any of those big brother 

329.14 330.15 B: yeah 

331.56 332.41 B: (( real )) 

333.54 347.01 B: right i've only seen a couple of those episodes and they didn't appear to me they didn't they didn't appeal to me all that much and what's really interesting about the big brother series though is the fact that they've got them online twenty four hours a day seven days a week see 

333.84 335.62 A: you know things 

346.81 347.88 A: right 

346.99 357.36 B: and so you watch them on you can watch the cameras online all the time and there are so many people that got into that i could not believe you know some of the num- 

356.37 359.73 A: it takes voyeurism to a whole another level doesn't it 

358.69 361.99 B: oh doesn't it yeah that's exactly what it is and that's 

360.87 367.15 A: and it's kind of startling to think that people are so interested in knowing what other people are doing at any given time 

366.80 367.90 B: (( right i- i )) 

367.86 369.29 A: (( you know i mean )) 

369.44 375.48 A: it also takes away e- every kind of ounce of your privacy you know so i i 

373.21 375.21 B: [cough] oh yeah see i can't 

375.71 376.52 B: (( [cough] i'm )) 

375.74 377.50 A: i can't deal with that 

376.85 388.77 B: no i wouldn't i would never sign on to be on something like that i i personally wouldn't never do a re- a a a real t._v. type uh you know thing uh uh y- i i just couldn't do that you know there's no way [laughter] 'cause 

387.89 389.68 A: (( i'd do the bachelorette )) 

389.74 391.55 B: you would do the bachelorette 

391.31 404.60 A: hell yeah why not you know if they're gonna like set you up with twenty really good looking guys they're going to pay for everything you're going to have great wardrobe great make up great hair and you may even get decent shag out of it i'm like 

392.34 394.21 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah but 

394.84 396.33 B: [laughter] 

398.69 402.33 B: [laughter] 

404.57 411.86 A: why not you know i mean look at look at the money that like joe millionaire um evan what's his face is making in endorsements 

404.92 406.28 B: hey you know what 

409.84 414.08 B: yeah five hundred thousand dollars each right and then all the contracts afterwards yeah 

413.33 422.81 A: yeah he's making so much money from all the endorsements since he's done that i'm like sure i'll do that if i'm going to make a couple of mill in the next year and then just like fade away into oblivion again 

420.70 424.10 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

422.75 436.49 A: why not but i mean all the other shows i'm just like not interested and i'm not interested in watching them i'm just like p- i'll participate if you want me to but i'm not going to be one of fifty girls that you're going to choose from 'cause i know you're going to boot my ass out yeah 

434.81 444.33 B: yeah that's that's a that's that's the that's the thing there that you know i think my husband would have a problem with me doing the bachelorette [laughter] i 

441.79 444.66 A: [laughter] 

445.04 448.14 A: yeah i know you could do the merry widow [laughter] [laughter] 

445.17 451.86 B: don't know if i told him how much i don't know if i told him yeah although if i told him how much money was involved he might not be so upset 

451.48 453.52 A: (( right yeah you could be the merry widow )) 

453.44 457.12 B: [laughter] no yeah right [laughter] 

454.32 461.08 A: [laughter] sorry honey you gotta go [laughter] yeah

505.68 515.80 A: yeah i'm i'm kind of i'm into all of those types of shows but as far as like reality t._v. i'm like it's a waste of space you know obviously they're trying to put trash out there i'm not really into it but 

511.84 512.91 B: yeah 

515.97 519.29 A: fall into that category [laughter] [laughter] 

517.14 531.28 B: yeah i i i i think you're absolutely right it's uh that's amazing that they connected us together that we're both interested in those kind of things and not interested in reality t._v. at all i mean you know it's a maybe a like i said a passing show i will look at you know and like the 

524.13 525.33 A: right 

526.24 527.28 A: (( you know ))

535.58 536.46 B: right

561.15 564.37 B: simon you're talking about [laughter] 

564.14 571.38 A: and it's like you know i'm pretty sure that he really sucks at some things as well and i'd really like to see him you know be put in his place
