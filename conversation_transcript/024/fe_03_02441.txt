36.74 39.49 B: okay well we'll talk about my topic first 

39.18 40.13 A: okay 

39.69 44.19 B: okay they asked why do you think they're so popular 

44.03 44.86 A: (( hm )) 

46.14 53.70 A: in a way i think they're kind of like less reality than like sitcoms or drama shows they're like more of a 

49.68 58.39 B: [mn] yeah i know yeah i think it's really stupid how america like some of 'em are interesting you know but some are really outrageous 

55.95 57.09 A: yeah 

57.71 59.01 A: yeah 

58.77 69.78 B: they are like um what was that one like the bachelor like the marrying shows when you marry people you don't base your decision on like a t._v. show and

66.63 67.76 A: [laughter] 

68.78 75.08 A: i know i find myself like watching them every now and then i'm just like this is such a strange phenomenon [laughter] 

73.36 82.05 B: [laughter] yeah like survivor was okay you know that was the beginning and everything but now it's just a little out of hand [laughter] [mn] 

76.86 78.07 A: yeah 

80.52 94.00 A: yeah i mean i think like good drama shows or something that are fictitious are supposed to be more like in tune with real life scenarios or they're supposed to mirror something about us but this is more like a distraction or an escapist thing 

93.69 97.43 B: yeah i don't know i think maybe america like 

97.56 104.27 B: lives out their i don't know lives out their fantasies or whatever they want to do by watching [noise] 

101.73 103.22 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

104.51 108.05 B: (( nothing [laughter] sorry um ))

129.96 131.89 B: have you okay you've seen it on 

130.79 136.85 A: i watched that the first time i didn't know if it was still on or not because i never see it or hear anything about it 

132.53 133.34 B: oh 

136.32 139.61 B: (( oh yeah it was like it's kinda degrading [mn] )) 

138.69 141.02 A: it's horrible [laughter] 

140.03 147.30 B: it's degrading eh but people actually go on it you know they they they put themselves in that place 

144.02 145.30 A: yeah 

146.33 150.26 A: i can't imagine wanting to do that one oh god 

148.58 156.43 B: i know i know but i mean if you're hot [laughter] you know and i guess you have to be a little cocky 

152.11 153.67 A: (( [laughter] )) 

154.20 163.24 A: i just don't understand like who's qualified to judge that you know like [laughter] one of the judges was like so perverted and weird [laughter] 

158.45 160.22 B: yeah the people 

161.95 164.72 B: yeah the the the blond guy 

164.09 165.02 A: (( yeah )) 

165.13 167.02 A: (( [laughter] )) 

166.27 170.74 B: but i was watching 'cause it was on after friends and i was like 

169.10 170.27 A: (( oh yeah )) 

170.88 181.08 B: [mn] it was kind of interesting it kind of held my attention 'cause like i don't know to see like who actually makes it i think i think the big thing is like who's gonna win you know 

174.34 175.42 A: yeah 

180.39 191.41 A: yeah i just think that's such a subjective thing i just don't understand how there's like they're promoting this whole like this is the standard of beauty i'm like oh come on do we really need that 

181.28 182.35 B: like 

184.94 186.53 B: i know 

189.93 196.68 B: i know one of 'em there like yeah you're good except for your knees [laughter] [laughter] it's like 

191.77 200.19 A: do we really need like oh god [laughter] like everyone needs to be more self conscious about their body have like more body issues 

199.74 204.73 B: yeah i know [mn] but other ones like um 

201.09 202.03 A: god 

204.74 207.87 B: what's the other one the bachelor i've seen 

207.93 211.47 B: that was oh no no joe millionaire you know the one 

210.09 212.18 A: yeah i watched that a couple of 

211.89 224.52 B: yeah i watched that a couple of times but um it was pretty funny how you could obviously tell the people who actually wanted to marry him for the money like that one blonde chick that was such a bitch [laughter] 

212.66 213.30 A: (( times )) 

220.75 221.85 A: yeah 

223.51 234.26 A: i know i thought he was going for her for a while [laughter] [laughter] i think he was just trying to make the show interesting in instead of like i don't know being married for like his temper 

225.69 228.44 B: [laughter] yeah but 

231.41 235.41 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah you feel like he was doing it for a joke and 

234.48 236.50 A: yeah [laughter] 

235.65 241.73 B: i didn't he like end up um didn't he end up divorcing or something 

241.17 248.96 A: i don't think so i don't i didn't like keep up with it after that i remember it was like in all these magazines and stuff i'm like argh [laughter] i'm embarrassed for these people 

246.79 249.17 B: yeah i'm sure it didn't work out and 

249.23 252.81 B: then there's that new one you know the one with the masks 

252.69 256.08 A: but the masks oh yeah i haven't watched that yet 

253.61 266.03 B: oh you haven- you know i haven't i don't think it came out i don't know if it came out yet yeah that one's a little too much they do they look like have you ever seen a movie with leonardo di caprio in it um 

257.05 259.42 A: (( that looks really weird the man in the )) 

265.69 266.47 A: (( iron mask )) 

266.64 269.74 A: yeah yeah that's kinda creepy 

266.91 267.68 B: (( oh )) 

267.89 270.64 B: that's what they remind me of i know it's 

270.74 273.67 B: (( a bit ah like sitting there talking to )) 

271.45 280.87 A: it's an interesting concept but i'm not sure like i mean you could obviously tell if there was like some big overweight person that they would still be judging on their appearance or something like i mean 

279.32 285.91 B: yeah yeah you're right yeah it is a good concept actually because most people are like you know 

281.12 282.50 A: [laughter] 

285.92 288.44 B: base what they like on looks 

287.91 292.53 A: yeah i mean it seems like it's going for something that's kind of yeah [laughter] [laughter] 

289.67 298.32 B: but it's just scary [laughter] to like sit there and have a conversation with someone in this weird colored mask and 

297.28 308.04 A: i can't imagine being that girl that has like thirty guys trying to win her over in like this really short amount of time like oh i can just pick and choose you know [laughter] 

300.96 303.42 B: yeah that'd be fun [laughter] 

304.17 306.20 B: [laughter] that'd be fun 

307.59 309.44 B: yeah but see then 

309.59 313.12 B: the the base thing is when like she picks somebody 

313.22 315.73 B: and then they take their mask off 

315.84 318.93 B: and you know like i don't know if 

316.46 317.57 A: [laughter] 

319.03 325.48 B: um like the t._v. show for n._b._c. or whoever has it is gonna make like everybody like 

322.33 323.36 A: yeah 

325.88 328.77 B: really really ugly or just really like 

327.32 329.52 A: [laughter] 

329.04 333.02 B: that would be i don't know like what what do you think the person would do 

332.46 333.59 A: yeah 

333.05 337.33 B: like i'm sorry i don't wanna do this any more [laughter] 

334.83 348.10 A: [laughter] they'd probably be like you know they're in front of a camera they probably have to go along with it just for their own like [mn] image or something [laughter] to not look like they're a bitch and like [mn] like oh you're ugly forget it [laughter] 

344.75 349.55 B: [laughter] well what if somebody had like i don't know like 

349.83 361.49 B: like hideous you know like some people i'm not trying to be mean or anything but some people are really just um are kinda hard to look at you know [laughter] wait so 

350.79 352.16 A: yeah [laughter] [laughter] 

353.05 355.00 A: (( [laughter] )) 

358.41 359.80 A: [laughter] 

361.86 364.12 B: um what are the other ones 

365.42 371.37 A: (( um i don't know i watched like survivor the first couple of seasons or something i watched like a lot of it yeah )) 

369.38 371.97 B: (( yeah they had a lotta hype )) 

371.90 376.11 B: they had this other show that was like teen survivor they had all these like 

374.97 376.19 A: oh really 

375.93 387.04 B: pre teens like thirteen year olds and stuff and they were all like crying like you know how oh i know what a reality t._v. show is um road rules and real r- world 

376.99 378.70 A: (( oh my god [laughter] )) 

385.76 389.35 A: that's right those were like the original ones 

387.46 388.75 B: yeah 

389.00 393.91 B: the actually yeah i think they are the actual original ones before it got all big 

393.41 394.55 A: yeah 

393.92 396.58 B: they've been on for like ten seasons probably 

395.97 400.54 A: i thought that when they first came out with that whole idea the real world was pretty interesting 

400.00 403.53 B: yeah th yeah yeah yeah i watched the real world 

400.80 405.09 A: i mean it kind of got like old after a couple of seasons but 

404.17 408.33 B: yeah i watched the last um the first one was like 

408.97 411.23 B: where was the first one seattle maybe 

411.14 412.25 A: (( um )) 

413.66 415.74 A: (( i don't know i think it was on the west coast )) 

415.62 423.83 B: well like i i never got into it like some people watch it every week okay this time gotta turn on the t._v. and the past season was las vegas and 

419.19 419.92 A: (( or something )) 

423.70 429.26 B: my roommate she was into it so i watched it and i kind of enjoyed it a little 

428.85 429.77 A: yeah 

429.08 432.05 B: just to find out like what they were doing you know 

431.65 432.63 A: yeah 

431.83 446.70 B: and seeing it like the commercials actually is what gets you into it 'cause they're like oh no what's going to happen and you see these other t- random two people making out or like [mn] somebody hitting somebody and you're like oh know who did what 

438.23 439.52 A: (( yeah )) 

443.15 444.23 A: yeah 

444.72 456.02 A: i sometimes wonder how much of it is just like editing i mean they make it so dramatic and everything but i wonder like there's so many hours that they don't show on there that it's just more like normal life when they're not showing 

452.10 453.89 B: yeah [laughter] 

455.41 463.78 B: yeah they show all the like worst of everything the worst absolutely worst of everything probably 'cause that's what keeps america interested 

456.39 459.88 A: and they pick these like yeah [laughter] 

463.10 465.23 A: yeah [laughter] 

463.86 470.30 B: [laughter] seriously they wouldn't make that much money if it was just people living their lives 

469.65 470.97 A: (( yep )) 

470.40 477.56 B: but that's why they have like those people 'cause they screen them [mn] i wonder what the criteria is to be on one of those 

476.54 481.90 A: [mn] everybody like wants to be on that i c- i would never wanna be like in front of the camera 

479.82 484.81 B: i don't know yeah i don't know if i'd want like a camera 

482.42 483.48 A: (( [laughter] )) 

484.76 492.53 A: oh i i don't think i could get used to it like they just seem like they don't notice it any more but i think i would always be self conscious about them 

485.35 485.97 B: (( [mn] )) 

492.49 503.08 B: yeah and always fixing like how i look [laughter] [laughter] like i'd always be like have a mirror and be like oh okay i don't have anything hanging on my nose or anything 

494.54 496.29 A: yeah [laughter] 

500.59 502.43 A: yeah [laughter] 

502.58 507.66 A: i know they're always following you around to the bathroom like when you first get up you're like argh leave me alone 

506.50 507.80 B: yeah 

507.82 522.38 B: i saw the like the follow up on the las vegas one and they were talking about how like there was rooms for the people the like the video camera people to sleep in [laughter] like in that in in their big like hotel suite they had 

517.22 518.49 A: oh wow 

518.51 520.08 A: [laughter] 

520.58 521.97 A: (( oh my god [laughter] oh yeah )) 

522.83 525.09 B: [laughter] but i think um 

525.47 533.91 B: i and then now i'm watching the real world versus road rules you know the battle of the sexes they have on m._t._v. 

533.36 535.21 A: (( oh wow i i've never seen that )) 

534.83 535.96 B: and um 

536.18 545.64 B: it's interesting i guess [laughter] it's not much of a reality show it's more of a competition 'cause it's mm battle of the sexes and everything but 

541.45 542.39 A: (( yeah uh )) 

546.16 550.16 B: um let me think is there any other subject of reality t._v. 

550.17 551.33 A: (( [laughter] i don't know )) 

551.69 552.90 B: um 

552.34 560.10 A: well there's always like the dating things that's just like sort of an extension of old dating games to this whole reality 

554.38 556.64 B: oh yeah the dating ones 

559.70 572.03 B: oh yeah like all those do you oh like the fifth wheel the fifth wheel and the one where they have like somebody has an earpiece and two of their friends like tell them what to do argh 

560.76 561.44 A: (( thing ))

574.06 575.34 A: [laughter] 

577.77 582.96 B: the basics are okay you know like blind date is okay 

582.38 583.60 A: yeah 

583.13 586.22 B: but like the fifth wheel where they take like 

586.06 587.20 A: [laughter] 

586.41 598.89 B: three of one sex and two of another and then they like mix them all together and introduce they have like four in the beginning and then they introduce the other guy or the other girl and [mn] i don't know [laughter] 

589.26 591.28 A: (( yeah it's so absurd )) 

595.57 596.65 A: yeah 

598.80 599.89 A: (( that's kind of like the s- ))
