39.65 41.00 B: things like that [mn]

48.02 48.81 A: oh 

49.08 50.15 B: oh i'm sorry 

50.88 65.67 B: i was just gonna say i thought i think anything that where something starts controlling you and not you controlling it you know i mean there's a difference between like social drinking and the and drinking too much 

59.31 61.07 A: mhm 

65.87 67.35 A: (( mhm )) 

67.48 70.62 B: so i don't know if one is worth than the other you know 

71.12 77.70 B: but anything that we get out of that makes us out of get out of control i don't think would be a good thing 

78.38 79.85 A: [mn] that's for sure 

79.41 80.80 B: yeah 

80.52 85.82 A: for sure the the foc- the focus is it's the faculties i think because

86.17 89.22 A: you know how many faculties are 

90.19 100.40 A: [mn] you know it's it's very fascinating ah in the past ah i know during world ward two that the pilots 

100.64 109.71 A: ah they used to drink quite a bit and i thought quite interesting for something where you have to be in so much control 

103.28 104.27 B: yes 

109.31 110.25 B: yes 

110.47 114.18 A: why would they be led to drink 

114.24 125.01 A: to be out of control to be under control that was the scenario so the quest- ah what would be worse well the question is 

119.51 120.68 B: right 

125.32 131.74 A: ah w- who is the one looking at the worst they're saying we are 

131.36 133.11 B: yeah 

132.30 145.74 A: ah that makes me made me wonder well look at that lady who lived to be a hundred and seven is it or a hundred and jean or something she smoked but the day but the day she stopped [mn] 

137.35 138.28 B: seven 

139.01 140.05 B: yes 

140.59 143.09 B: yeah i know

146.41 151.99 A: she stopped is that worse [laughter] mm 

150.68 157.63 B: good point i yeah i have people in my family that you know have had bad habits and they lived a very long time 

156.69 158.42 A: mhm 

157.80 158.91 B: you know 

160.09 170.08 B: um and like my parents were social drinkers but i have friends who have quite a problem and they lose control and they get inappropriate and they you know 

170.08 178.52 B: um [mn] have a real problem with drinking but it's just because i think some people have addictive personalities too 

178.57 179.29 A: mm 

179.06 180.17 B: you know 

180.61 183.38 B: not making them bad people it's just i think some people 

183.74 185.64 B: can't like my mom 

185.72 189.04 B: could not quit smoking she was addicted to nicotine 

189.21 190.11 A: (( ahah )) 

189.97 194.84 B: you know and so she just could not not smoke 

192.69 193.70 A: maybe 

194.11 201.28 A: maybe according to what we hear is that whatever drugs in into the tobacco so maybe it wasn't the tobacco itself 

201.24 202.65 B: good point [mn] 

202.62 205.18 A: okay n- smoking is 

205.23 211.19 A: ah part of it [mn] ah nicotine was just ah nicotine ah i mean the 

210.20 211.91 B: right 

211.27 220.43 A: the ball players that that chewed nicotine you know that's really bad because ah most of the cases they get cancer of the mouth so it

233.63 235.99 A: it it just you know it 

236.92 242.21 A: to me to me it's a person chooses to be their lifestyle 

241.71 242.77 B: yes 

242.43 253.03 A: ah whether it's corre- right or not ah i've really been influenced lately by a man by the name of michael savage i don't know if you know him

270.91 271.70 B: okay 

272.95 274.32 B: (( [mn] okay )) 

274.70 285.26 A: um th- and and he was also a epi- epide- ah ah what is studied you know diseases so he's been up and up i mean what's worse sars

288.98 290.24 B: good point

294.16 296.98 B: yeah yeah yeah 

297.16 306.64 B: and well i think anything that [mn] as far as taking control of you like i have a friend who ah is addicted to espresso and you know spends a lot of money and 

297.46 299.07 A: yeah 

307.02 314.37 B: goes to starbucks or whatever every day just to get a buzz and you know that becomes a problem 

314.05 315.66 A: yeah 

315.87 316.67 A: (( [mn] so )) 

315.89 322.10 B: (( [mn] people sure i somebody thinks that maybe going to school is ah not going out of control but there are professional )) 

321.62 330.09 A: (( i think whatever someone does that maybe is taking them out of control [mn] yeah )) 

325.40 326.34 B: (( students that lose )) 

330.24 333.15 A: (( yes [laughter] )) 

330.86 337.84 B: it i have a friend who is one yeah and can function very very well in school 

338.06 344.30 B: but cannot function out of school that's it i that's a very good point and i totally agree with you 

344.30 347.07 A: and and how does that affect him 

347.19 350.30 B: that they can't function in the real world 

349.88 352.13 A: but i mean is it deadly 

353.21 358.20 B: [mn] [lipsmack] well [sigh] not to them no because i think they are happy 

358.73 360.31 B: you know 'cause they've kind of 

360.56 361.26 B: (( of )) 

361.85 372.03 B: [mn] worked their whole life around school and always getting one degree or another and that's all they do and if they're happy then i guess you know more power to them 

371.81 382.65 A: ah well one other question is what is this in relations to i mean does it affect other people [mn] i mean obviously we we figure the thing with sars 

382.30 383.30 B: yeah 

383.71 386.03 A: it affects other people ah 

385.19 386.27 B: yes 

386.18 400.90 A: i mean you can't qua- i mean you know what are we going to do quarantine all the smokers that's what's going on with the laws in this country we're quarantining all the smokers then we're quarantining all the drinkers then we're quarantining e- i mean what is going on here 

400.61 404.67 B: good point that's a very good point 

404.76 405.93 B: (( because ah )) 

407.27 410.55 B: ah i think as as long as ah i don't know 

407.39 411.13 A: [mn] 

410.69 413.25 B: um like i have a a neighbor who 

413.34 418.79 B: is a very serious alcoholic and her life's going to you know gonna have 

418.91 421.59 B: she has cirrhosis of the liver 

419.00 420.22 A: yeah 

421.63 422.78 A: yeah 

421.65 424.63 B: so i would say she has a major problem [mn] 

425.37 429.04 B: sadly 'cause she cannot not drink 

428.45 429.06 A: (( mm )) 

429.84 434.71 B: and i don't even invite her over any more because she's always inappropriate 

436.54 441.49 B: and that i think would be a problem when you know when it starts affecting your life 

436.74 438.43 A: (( yeah )) 

442.38 446.08 B: in her case people don't want her around 

446.28 447.16 A: (( s- ahah )) 

446.77 449.94 B: and so it you know has become a an illness 

450.04 454.28 A: mm yeah that is that that is another social disease 

453.31 454.31 B: yes 

454.35 460.41 A: but i think you you're absolutely right i think that there is something there that how 

461.11 463.10 A: (( how can one )) 

464.05 468.45 A: ah communicate with someone who has this problem 

467.80 468.92 B: yes 

469.11 477.11 A: firstly in a one to one but however a- and it saddens me to say there is no um 

477.26 479.87 A: second step to that it there is only 

478.94 480.72 B: right 

479.96 483.92 A: there is only oh you put them in these groups to 

482.92 483.76 B: yeah 

483.96 491.06 A: them but y- no one in the family or friends is in that group 

489.84 492.08 B: right right 

491.59 503.27 A: to ah to point out the situation to them to give them a kind of a handle to get back into society instead they have their own handles ah ah 

503.97 511.59 A: ah drinkers anonymous and all these groups and how can they get back in the real world i mean 

512.76 514.16 A: (( interesting )) 

514.41 518.28 B: well in my neighbor's case she can't because she is so far gone 

518.19 518.93 A: mm 

518.96 524.29 B: and what's sad is that the few times she is sober she's a very delightful person 

524.17 525.10 A: yes 

524.97 532.87 B: but most times i can't even invite her in because she is so inappropriate and i feel bad for her because she does have cirrhosis 

533.12 539.20 B: and she has a lot of personal problems and a lot of daily problems because of her alcoholism 

538.86 540.64 A: yeah 

539.74 546.73 B: and i- it's very sad but i you know i can't have anything to do with her really [mn] because her life is out of control 

546.25 547.25 A: yes 

547.54 555.99 B: and um i'm not a drinker myself but you know i have other things my [mn] my thing is late night eating so i think you know everybody has 

556.04 556.83 A: (( [laughter] )) 

556.51 559.44 B: something that that is a problem 

559.33 560.29 A: sure 

560.93 564.36 B: and as long as i don't weigh eight hundred pounds and i feel i 

564.57 567.20 B: i think people have to monitor themselves too 

567.85 569.07 B: you know 

567.93 574.14 A: yeah influenced by this word i think in our generation moderation 

573.72 574.68 B: yes 

574.68 589.12 A: and we haven't really understood the word balance ah a friend of mine ah acquaintance ah who is a res- a major researcher her name is ann a. n. n. de d. e. wees w. e. e. s. 

588.71 589.70 B: okay
