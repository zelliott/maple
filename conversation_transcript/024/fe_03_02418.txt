0.22 1.98 B: hi i'm melissa 

2.01 3.93 A: hi i'm carol 

3.64 4.95 B: hi carol 

4.96 7.70 A: this is the first time i'm doing this [laughter] 

6.69 13.67 B: same here i've never done this before um i guess i guess we just talk about this topic for ten minutes or however it works 

12.97 18.74 A: yeah that's what my sister said we we and i think they're picking personal habits 

18.69 22.77 B: okay and your sister's gotten paid so this is legitimate and everything 

19.23 19.93 A: (( a- )) 

22.37 24.84 A: oh yeah uh-huh [laughter] 

22.98 23.80 B: okay 

23.89 24.86 B: um 

24.99 27.73 B: i think smoking is pretty bad for you 

27.93 30.30 B: um i'm not a smoker so 

30.59 32.21 B: i think that would bother me 

32.24 33.94 A: okay um 

34.96 40.45 A: i don't think it's what bothers you i think it's um i i think what you think is the worst um 

40.34 41.98 B: i think that's the worst 

41.42 44.99 A: yeah okay i you see i don't i don't smoke either um 

45.11 50.93 A: but i i truthfully i don't think smoking would be the worst i think overeating is the worst 

50.82 57.86 A: because when you um overeat a lot and then you start getting heavy and then you know if you have like a heart condition and everything 

57.68 68.26 A: i think that that really affects you the most i guess maybe smoking i guess smoking would for those people that have had cancer but somehow you don't you don't see the effects 

60.71 61.75 B: oh sure 

67.96 75.43 B: right right but if you overeating is bad but we don't know if the person exercises frequently too 

68.48 69.21 A: if 

76.48 79.73 B: and then it would kind of overset if you eat a lot 

80.30 84.05 A: usually yeah i know but usually people that overeat 

84.10 85.01 A: um 

85.42 88.24 A: have a tendency not [laughter] 

85.99 91.18 B: so [laughter] you're right i have an overweight cousin so i could 

91.10 103.52 B: um she has trouble i mean sh- we walk down the street to a store or even in the mall and she's breathing heavily so you're right in that instance i would agree that that's pretty bad too 

104.58 108.32 A: the only i guess that the big difference is that when you overeat 

108.62 121.13 A: you're really not bothering anybody but yourself and i i know for a fact because i mean i've been um like my sister smokes when you're with people that smoke a lot you're breathing it in 

121.25 126.90 A: and then you're s- you're having to smell it you know it's like i have people at work that they 

126.93 133.79 A: we teach and they they run out on breaks to smoke and they come when they come back into the school 

134.30 136.35 A: you could just smell them 

135.13 137.35 B: (( um mhm mhm mm yeah it you do mhm )) 

136.94 142.79 A: i mean you don't have to know what they were doing you could just smell them their clothing their hair 

142.81 150.40 A: um everything just reeks of smoke if you goes like went out like three weeks ago we we went to um yeah like um a club 

150.56 155.62 A: and i came home that night and i took off my you know my my clothes and everything 

155.65 158.61 A: everything just smelt like smoke 

158.28 159.76 B: yeah i hate that 

159.57 166.78 A: you know even my hair i mean i just everything was just full of smoke and i know everybody always has to take a shower to get the smoke out of you 

166.88 172.18 A: so i mean but it doesn't bother me that much i mean i don't like the smell but 

172.19 175.60 A: i have on occasion smoked you know cigarettes 

175.74 182.93 A: especially like if i'm like you know nervous kind of thing [laughter] so it's something in my hands so that's why i don't think it's you know 

179.31 180.11 B: right 

183.01 185.46 A: i don't think it's the worst have you ever smoked 

184.90 187.67 B: (( mhm mhm right i've never smoked but um )) 

187.79 190.00 B: you know the one thing i i have a few 

190.55 191.94 B: smoke and 

191.97 198.98 B: they get really heavily dependent on it like he said they're constantly taking breaks at work i mean any kind of stress 

199.08 200.22 B: all of a sudden 

200.71 212.60 B: i got to go for a smoke and to me i mean that could be bad too because you're depending on a cigarette that's harming your health and other people too if you're smoking around people so 

213.48 214.65 B: i don't know but then 

214.73 217.30 B: with the overweight cousin of mine 

217.40 220.05 B: she eats when she's depressed too so 

220.22 224.63 B: i guess it's all these different types of dependencies that you have 

224.35 235.92 A: well i've been eating lately when i've been stressed [laughter] out at work today i actually well i'm not i'm not heavy i was actually walking around with a bag of potato chips [laughter] at one point 

235.60 236.74 B: (( oh yeah i )) 

236.91 244.50 B: yeah i snack a lot at work too but [laughter] but i mean i work out a lot too so it kind of overrides it i can't remember what 

244.62 247.16 B: there was a few other things i mean 

247.18 248.07 A: um 

247.21 249.85 B: exercising regularly i think is 

250.13 261.03 B: you know important too i mean like my cousin can barely walk through the mall without breaking down and having to take a break and sit down for half an hour 

262.32 275.84 A: well that's because when you overeat that your heart's working out and you know you have you can't breath as well you know you start having you know labored breaths and everything one of the things that they said there was you know too much drinking 

264.42 265.85 B: (( overweight yeah right mm )) 

275.81 276.97 B: mhm 

276.31 290.00 A: that doesn't bother me all all um my friends have a tendency they they like beer i don't like beer but they drink a lot it doesn't seem to bother me i mean i don't mind if people are drinking as long as they're not sloppy drinkers 

285.73 286.48 B: ah 

289.22 291.49 B: as long as they don't drink and drive 

292.52 297.30 B: that worries me too like people just being silly at parties or bars and then 

298.06 300.54 B: (( being irresponsible after they drink )) 

300.29 302.63 A: where are you what area are you from 

302.55 305.39 B: california what are you from back in boston 

305.16 311.22 A: a- no i i'm in well i'm originally from new i work in new york every day but i'm i'm from jersey 

311.03 324.47 B: i knew you had the east coast accent i was born and raised in new york i lived in boston for eight years and i lived in jersey for a year [laughter] and then i moved out to california so i was like where's that accent coming from [laughter] ah 

312.21 313.04 A: [laughter] 

323.85 331.08 A: everybody knows this accent i mean all i have to do is open my mouth and that's it they know exactly where i'm from 

330.15 332.55 B: yeah it's definitely the east coast mm mm [mn] 

332.56 340.43 A: and i haven't even lived here all my life that's the funny part i've lived down south for many years but the accent has never 

340.94 342.73 A: has never left 

342.80 343.93 A: but um 

344.27 349.88 A: (( okay getting back to overeating [laughter] i think that's what we're supposed to talk about [laughter] )) 

345.41 346.43 B: yeah 

349.05 352.29 B: yeah well they said to introduce ourselves um 

352.44 353.56 B: (( yeah i'm ))

361.99 364.50 B: you know my the time i get my 

364.36 378.83 B: monthly doodads i tend to overeat or yeah if i'm at work if i'm stressed out i tend we have like a um like a starbucks near us so i always go for one of their ice blended coffee drinks and 

373.43 374.21 A: right 

379.27 383.29 B: i mean that has so much calorie in itself and it's ah like i think 

384.00 387.68 B: i mean i'm not overweight by any means but 

388.35 389.37 B: i do 

389.50 395.93 B: crave food a lot like snack i eat a lot for a person my size but i do work out frequently too 

395.46 404.48 A: yeah well and some people have fast metabolisms i used to so you have a tendency to be able to eat a lot more than you know 

404.53 410.53 A: somebody who who doesn't have a fast metabolism but there's one thing i know i would never do 

410.53 425.26 A: i would never go on a cruise that well i have friends and they've really been pushing me to go on a cruise i mean like they've been dying to go on a cruise and even say oh we'll pay half for you you know like the whole bit and the thought of being on a cruise with 

412.51 413.55 B: (( mhm mhm mhm really mhm )) 

424.35 425.61 B: with lots of food 

425.33 433.35 A: with all that food being served and all that you know smorgasbord kind of food eat as much as you want and the variety 

433.53 437.16 A: i know that i would not do well 

437.20 443.09 B: mhm it's really not that bad i've been on a cruise and i mean it's there but like 

443.36 454.06 B: there's so much activity on the boat so you would you yourself would have to be like okay i am now going to the cafeteria to get food or i'm now going to the dining room to get food or 

455.00 466.91 B: you know there's like on the top part of the boat is like the pool like it's outdoorsy and there's like a certain area where the bar is where all the food is so unless you purposely walk yourself to it 

466.53 469.32 A: oh i would be walking myself 

468.08 469.81 B: (( [laughter] mm mm )) 

469.33 473.93 A: to it just 'cause i know i every time i go to you know a wedding or 

473.91 486.77 A: anything where there's a smorgasbord or i have a tendency not to go to those places like if you ever go to a chinese smorgasbord i mean i i cannot believe what i usually [laughter] eat at these places i have to try everything 

487.00 501.77 A: and i said forget it i cannot and so i know not to go to these places because i would just eat myself into oblivion whereas when i go to a restaurant i eat don't even get dessert you know i like walking away 

501.89 505.69 A: not feeling totally full i don't like that really full feeling 

505.86 507.99 A: that you get when you've eaten a lot 

508.31 513.25 B: right yeah my cousin orders two desserts so she's quite addicted [laughter] 

513.61 520.75 B: but i think it's more i think these types of habits where it's smoking or drinking or 

513.82 514.69 A: (( oh )) 

521.02 525.97 B: overeating i think a lot of it has to do with stress 

527.05 529.49 B: and in your mind you've 

529.67 538.44 B: viewed that thing whether it's drinking or smoking or eating as like a way to relieve your stress it's you know you kind of become 

538.92 546.81 B: addicted to it it's like a you're dependent on it like a lot of people after work they go for a drink so that's how they relax [laughter] 

547.14 551.95 A: i could see that i mean i i don't really eat after work 

552.04 557.12 A: but today [laughter] today we had fun overeating it's um 

556.27 565.64 B: yeah like m- i know my cousin likes on her drive home from work she's like oh i had a rough day today i'm treating myself to a burger and shake or something you know mm 

564.96 568.85 A: no today they had um today was um april thirtieth 

569.11 578.18 A: maybe they didn't do it in california i don't know about the advertising they had bask- this is really funny baskin and robbins had free ice cream cones 

577.72 580.03 B: oh yeah i think so mhm mm 

579.38 586.38 A: all right well i i have a um i have a fifteen year old in fact so i had my son and his friends 

586.22 597.37 A: and we went to one basket and robbins and they got the ice cream and then after the ice-cream they wanted to try different flavors and it just so happens where we live there are like three basket and robbins and they're maybe like 

597.68 599.95 A: five minutes of each other in different directions [laughter]
