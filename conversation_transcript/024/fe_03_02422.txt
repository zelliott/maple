0.65 2.48 A: hey my name is treney 

2.94 4.68 B: hi my name is bonnie 

4.44 5.56 A: hey how are you 

5.21 6.10 B: okay 

6.16 8.66 A: ah good and so shall we start talking 

8.58 11.46 B: right i don't know this is my first time ever doing this [laughter] 

11.04 13.42 A: (( ah and that's a for me also )) 

13.23 14.18 B: oh 

13.88 17.63 A: okay so they said the topic is personal habits 

17.28 18.42 B: right 

17.84 21.70 A: okay so what do you think is the [mn] ah is the worst one 

21.60 28.37 B: i missed the last two but i think um it's a toss between gossip and excessive caffeine 

28.06 31.90 A: g- okay i think overeat overeating is the bad thing 

32.56 35.66 B: i thought gossip gossip was the first or second 

35.10 37.14 A: yeah something like that yes 

36.59 37.92 B: yeah 

37.33 40.81 A: so you think ah gossip is a really bad personal habit 

40.70 42.30 B: i think so yeah 

41.69 42.62 A: why 

43.33 44.38 B: um 

44.45 48.25 B: just it can get out of hand and your ch- children could pick up on it 

47.78 48.75 A: uh-huh 

48.34 53.93 B: you know i don't know just from what i see on line and in real life it it's not good [laughter] 

52.11 52.96 A: (( oh )) 

53.10 57.64 A: but um that's true actually i really think overeating is bad because 

58.03 61.51 A: ah what happens in overeating is people 

62.09 63.53 A: tend to be 

63.79 70.18 A: leaning towards personal gratification immediately because once a week you get the gratification of the 

66.79 67.66 B: mhm 

69.88 71.03 B: right 

70.44 73.75 A: but the long term effects of it are usually bad 

73.45 74.72 B: mhm 

74.03 79.78 A: so people fall for the immediate gratification rather than for the long term thing that's my opinion 

79.54 84.44 B: that's more a health issue than a personal habit don't you think so maybe some people can't help themselves 

84.20 86.19 A: yeah that's that's true 

85.88 93.21 B: so it might not be a habit it might just be a health condition or it might be something they were they genetically you know they're not responsible for 

92.93 98.62 A: ah and it's possible but what happens is people usually tend to eat when they watch television 

98.40 102.02 B: yes that's why i get up when a commercial comes on [laughter] mm 

98.80 99.85 A: and they 

101.42 114.51 A: [laughter] yeah okay and people when they watch television what happens they don't ah actually they the amount of food they eat they they t- take a big chips packet and start start eating then they think yeah 

113.91 115.15 B: right 

114.53 120.45 A: yeah so that's what i think [laughter] is the thing so [laughter] you you need to for something yeah 

119.83 124.03 B: okay but what were the other options i didn't hear them or did you get what they all were 

123.61 126.60 A: (( i listened to about three of them one was gossip )) 

125.64 127.51 B: they didn't have smoking did they 

127.10 129.21 A: yes they mentioned smoking 

127.60 140.01 B: oh okay they did have smoking okay i'm an ex-smoker so i don't know [laughter] but that's more health related than i think a habit that you you know what i mean a- but a habit i think is somebody who will like um 

129.53 131.04 A: they mentioned smoking 

131.95 133.83 A: okay ah they mentioned 

140.24 141.63 B: like um g- 

141.64 147.82 B: ah twirls their hair or picks their teeth or or snaps their fingers you know that's like a habit you know 

147.52 161.35 A: yeah that's true but what happens even smoking it depends on how we want to classify it something what people do is when they it becomes more like a habit for them for example some of my colleagues can't um 

148.00 148.79 B: or 

152.63 153.32 B: (( mm )) 

157.07 158.42 B: (( right mhm )) 

161.87 165.31 A: (( quit smoking even for a night so what they do is every )) 

165.51 171.95 A: hour they just go down stairs and they have a smoke so it has become more like a personal habit rather than for the pleasure of it 

170.76 185.60 B: right yeah i quit smoking like six or seven years ago but um i still have mints every day i you know i it's like a habit when i used to smoke you know i didn't want bad breath so i would p- i would have tic tacs all the time and that's that's still with me i still have the tic 

174.12 174.95 A: (( mhm y- )) 

178.64 179.59 A: mhm 

179.77 180.68 A: mhm 

182.03 182.93 A: mhm 

185.01 186.29 A: okay that's 

185.50 190.15 B: tacs it's ah yeah so it's like a habit that kept with me from the smoking 

186.73 187.47 A: (( that's )) 

188.32 189.24 A: mhm 

189.79 191.38 A: yeah that's [laughter] 

190.19 192.38 B: to make sure that my breath is always okay 

192.12 199.05 A: okay that is always good yeah [laughter] where you you can have a habit which always is a pleasurable experience yeah 

192.84 193.78 B: (( [laughter] )) 

194.30 195.64 B: yeah right 

198.41 205.49 B: right right it depends on the habit exactly and i don't know what the other options were though i can't remember there was about eight of them 

199.11 200.17 A: yeah 

201.21 202.17 A: yeah 

205.22 211.53 A: right i remember gossip i remember smoking i remember drinking 

207.69 208.54 B: yeah 

209.44 210.50 B: mhm 

211.41 213.82 B: drinking okay yeah right 

212.73 215.97 A: (( and i remember overeating )) 

216.37 219.62 A: (( and ah i remember )) 

216.52 217.20 B: (( oh )) 

218.62 219.25 B: (( yes )) 

219.71 220.81 A: (( the )) 

220.93 221.87 B: what 

221.55 225.30 A: they also mentioned some something else i d- don't know 

224.36 226.00 B: oh i didn't yeah 

225.56 228.30 A: so those are the things that they mentioned 

227.71 229.22 B: (( oh okay i )) 

228.40 235.20 A: okay but i don't know what the p- what's the purpose of this study they might want to see how people talk to each other 

235.38 238.86 B: think yeah i think the whole thing is about speech isn't it or not 

238.26 246.81 A: (( yeah maybe it's speech yeah it's a meeting and they talk what are the things they will talk and how do they talk how the conversation goes )) 

239.80 240.83 B: maybe 

246.15 248.78 B: that could be yeah i don't know so this is your first one too 

248.49 249.91 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

249.44 254.49 B: [laughter] yeah my first too 'cause ah they're like very um 

254.79 256.43 B: (( what do i say um )) 

256.65 262.84 B: exactly on time because i i forgot what times i signed up for and i had to go on line to see what times 

262.08 263.75 A: (( right mhm )) 

262.85 265.24 B: and um they yesterday 

265.16 272.90 B: at like exactly whatever time it was like say five o'clock at five o'clock they called and the day before exactly at four o'clock but my 

267.67 268.93 A: (( mm )) 

272.56 273.13 A: (( ah )) 

272.68 282.51 B: my power went out and my clocks were off by two minutes and i was still on the computer because i have dial up and like as soon as i turn off the computer i had the message and i was like oh i missed them by thirty seconds you know 

275.45 276.35 A: okay 

281.75 288.65 A: oh okay so i think that same happened with me also yesterday they have apparently called and i was not at my home 

285.52 286.44 B: yeah 

288.21 289.13 B: uh-huh 

288.82 291.72 A: and there was an automated message i think but 

291.11 296.15 B: yeah press one or press two so i tried pressing two just to see what would happen [laughter] but nothing happened 

295.32 296.65 A: yeah that's true 

296.40 298.83 B: yeah right that could be it 

298.18 306.09 A: okay so ah what ah so your your opinion gossip is a really bad personal habit a 

305.23 311.49 B: i think just from my experience um because i go on line a lot and like go to these communities and it just 

308.58 309.49 A: (( mhm )) 

310.16 311.77 A: (( yahoo um )) 

311.57 316.44 B: yeah different communities and boards like m._s._n. and yahoo g- groups groups 

315.38 317.09 A: (( yahoo and uh-huh )) 

316.55 318.69 B: yahoo groups and m._s._n. groups 

317.25 318.14 A: uh-huh 

318.32 319.73 A: (( okay i got it )) 

318.81 333.74 B: and then writing communities and and just just in the last three years that i've been there it's just gotten worse in the last couple of days um women just gossip back and forth and men gossip and it's just it gets so out of hand that people are very upset about it 

325.20 326.15 A: mhm 

331.27 332.12 A: mhm 

333.08 334.01 A: okay 

334.53 337.77 A: (( so you are talking more about online gossip right )) 

337.17 337.82 B: (( yeah mm )) 

337.89 339.98 A: (( you're talking about online gossip )) 

339.93 341.04 B: yeah 

340.54 344.80 A: okay so but i think it applies for the general gossip also 

344.80 345.76 B: mhm 

345.44 355.96 A: yeah so that's ah what my my point is overeating is something because drinking and other things um see w- w- what the problem with w- w- with everything is it affects all age groups 

346.52 347.79 B: (( general gossip )) 

351.67 352.56 B: right 

355.49 356.50 B: mhm 

356.26 360.97 A: and even ch- from children to ah elderly people senior citizens it 

360.39 362.28 B: right that's true 

361.22 364.44 A: so i thought that might be a worse per- personal habit but 

363.64 369.08 B: yes that's true that's true right i guess i was thinking more health so what do i know [laughter] 

367.91 369.72 A: so [laughter] 

369.16 375.85 B: 'cause that's like a personal personal you're talking about other people all the time you know and it's a habit that probably people can't break who knows 

375.44 378.49 A: yeah maybe i don't mm i 

376.31 382.34 B: yeah i don't know a- a- i'm i'm probably more influenced by just what's been going on the last couple of days that i've been reading 

381.91 393.09 A: ah that's true actually i was also reading something on that's why i was talking to you about immediate gratification right but it's a it's it's philosophy called a pag p. a. g. pag 

387.80 388.97 B: mhm 

392.95 393.82 B: uh-huh 

393.47 396.87 A: and that's called this problem with instant gratification 

396.56 397.52 B: (( mhm )) 

397.09 398.07 A: so people 

398.15 403.54 A: (( tend to you know getting all with habits in which there is immediately gratification )) 

403.23 404.62 B: right mhm 

403.66 407.68 A: even though it might have a bigger negative impact in the future 

407.47 413.23 B: right i'm surprised they didn't say anything about exercise though you know because i mean people can over exercise too [laughter] you know 

412.80 414.24 A: yeah that's true 

413.40 420.20 B: you know you've got these men that take the shots and the steroids and stuff like that and you know they just go overboard yeah it is 

417.03 418.57 A: yeah yeah that's true 

419.14 426.60 A: so as i said it's like what we saw experienced in the last couple of days will have a definitely 

426.00 435.14 B: oh yeah it will impact you and influence you yeah 'cause it's you see people in commercials you know those a- the way that they you know show you those people eating the food or whatever [laughter] 

430.56 431.57 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

434.20 435.60 A: yeah that's true 

435.39 439.09 B: and then you go out subconsciously and it's like oh i want one of those i want one of these 

438.74 440.28 A: yeah that's true 

440.08 440.98 B: yeah 

441.24 445.62 A: (( so it's isn't it the not yet right )) 

445.04 449.28 B: i have they said that there was going to be a beep or something indicating when the ten minutes was up 

448.90 449.93 A: okay 

449.10 460.95 B: a- th- the other one that i missed they didn't say yesterday what it was but monday they said the topic was food [laughter] because that's kind of funny that you were talking about overeating and the topic monday was food so 

452.81 453.35 A: (( ah )) 

455.02 455.93 A: okay 

456.01 456.90 A: okay 

460.25 468.35 A: mhm i think it's ah i think this is a maybe they're doing some study i don't know i might i think it should be very interesting [laughter] 

465.40 466.28 B: mhm 

467.71 473.33 B: right did you sign up for their other stuff that they do where you go on line on thursdays and you do a something every thursday 

473.26 477.40 A: they do i i don't know what th- that's good yeah do they do something 

475.52 476.66 B: (( i don't know i signed )) 

476.67 481.95 B: i signed i don't know i i was looking all over the place trying to find more and that's when i found um 

481.99 487.83 B: a link um they use you sign up every thursday and you get like three dollars for the survey or something so 

483.34 484.83 A: is it in a it's in a 

487.22 493.14 A: okay that's um that's something to think so that was an information for me yeah thanks yeah 

490.77 491.94 B: (( yeah i don't know )) 

492.52 498.32 B: yeah i'm not sure where i found it though [laughter] but it had something to do with the same place that is doing this right here you know mhm 

494.43 495.73 A: (( [laughter] no )) 

497.24 504.79 A: (( no i i can always find it because i i usually play on the internet forever for about fifteen hours a day )) 

504.58 505.77 B: mhm 

505.21 508.04 A: (( so i think i'll be able i'll be able to find it out ah )) 

507.44 510.70 B: right did you sign up for every day to do this or just a couple of days 

510.65 516.75 A: i signed for the previous this week but on monday and tuesday actually i came home really late 

516.35 517.16 B: right 

516.96 520.25 A: so i think that maybe tomorrow and friday and 

520.13 523.32 B: uh-huh did you sign up for more than one time a day or no 

522.83 524.04 A: no only once 

523.70 526.98 B: yeah right i wasn't sure what people do with it [laughter] 

526.38 532.40 A: yeah i i heard sometimes it's difficult because you see if it is a casual conversation you can continue 

532.41 533.27 B: right 

532.57 537.05 A: (( but if it is constrained by a topic and you are asked to talk for ten minutes )) 

536.93 538.12 B: mhm 

537.46 541.05 A: then it becomes kind of difficult to talk yes 

539.05 540.00 B: right 

540.10 545.55 B: right and i run errands when my kids when they're in school and plus i only have a dial up connection so i
