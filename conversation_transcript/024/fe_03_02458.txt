243.69 250.44 B: i don't know i don't know you know some of these guys you know that are coming up like i've got a k- i've got a couple of kids my that are teenagers [mn] 

250.57 260.81 B: and some of them [mn] n- not mine but some of the ones out there expect seem to expect to get everything and not have to pay anything for it 

250.85 251.47 A: (( yeah )) 

260.38 261.59 A: yeah 

260.98 262.20 B: you know the 

262.36 271.41 B: ah some of my kids' friends they they literally you know they go up to mom and say hey mom give me the money and momma hands over fifty bucks you know jeez 

268.24 268.85 A: (( [mn] )) 

270.72 271.32 A: (( yeah )) 

271.73 282.49 B: [mn] my kids don't do that one thing is they know we ain't got fifty bucks [laughter] but another you know they just they don't expect a whole bunch of of things 

282.13 283.05 A: yeah 

282.59 286.96 B: they want 'em of course don't get me wrong but ah 

286.19 294.80 A: well like on um that real real world or whatever that's really stupid that's they're going to take some kid's life when other kids are out there doing the same thing 

290.96 292.24 B: yeah 

294.53 302.07 B: yeah and like i say these these reality shows sometimes it makes you wonder about whose reality are we talking about 

302.10 312.25 B: 'cause you know like i say you know the the survivors you know [mn] and [mn] you know let's m- you know let's m- well there's another one out now 

302.42 303.02 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

312.49 315.83 B: [lipsmack] where there's a la- w- a girl trying to 

316.47 321.16 B: you know pick out a one twenty twenty guys that are running round with funny masks on 

321.49 327.73 B: she don't get to see what they look like but yet she's supposedly got to pick one of these guys to get married to 

327.39 330.25 A: well why would you want to do that if you didn't know who they were 

330.30 340.34 B: don't get me wrong i don't know [laughter] me i got i got married but i know what she looks like you know [laughter] ah you know there are 

339.46 340.58 A: (( [laughter] )) 

340.65 345.39 B: i don't know you know it just seems to me like y- you know you shouldn't take in 

341.47 342.39 A: somebody 

345.43 351.56 B: in you know th- there's just so many people out there they're worried so much about getting that quick buck 

351.85 358.01 A: well there are people who go out and they pick dates for people and they ring them back and they go on dates with them and 

355.05 355.97 B: yeah 

358.51 359.94 A: that's just stupid 

359.78 369.32 B: well you know it's it all goes back to you know for some reason the y- younger generation like i say they expect a whole bunch of nothing 

370.10 379.44 B: [mn] an- or they expect everything and they want everything but then expecting somebody else to give it to them 

378.50 380.25 A: yeah 

379.58 391.62 B: and that's what all these programs that's what they're about is getting something for doing nothing you know to me going out there you know for well the one on the amazon right now that they're just about to finish off 

385.06 386.27 A: for doing something 

391.79 404.36 B: how what's so hard about going out there and living off the land all's you gotta do is know how to catch fish or or how to to find something that's edible or not necessarily edible you just gotta be willing to eat it 

404.74 407.02 A: that's just nasty some of the stuff they eat 

405.80 415.44 B: [mn] and that's that and just you know and taking and and and taking a- and knowing a little bit about what you're doing that's all it takes 

415.41 416.30 A: yeah 

415.42 428.22 B: you know but they make it a lot harder in the fact that [mn] they've pit one person against the other so that they make sure that you know they- they're saying okay everybody you know whoever wins i don't even remember what the main prize is 

428.11 442.85 B: [mn] but basically they're saying you know you put twenty twenty five people out here and in the space of about three months you know they they kick everybody off but one or two people and then they pick and choose and y- you know you may go through all that and not win a a penny 

442.92 445.09 B: so what's the use of it you know 

444.87 448.31 A: i think it's stupid i- it's dumb it's just a waste of time 

448.10 452.83 B: yeah [mn] and i think it's a waste of t._v. space too y- you 

452.40 456.15 A: there's never nothing on you flip through channels and you just can't find anything 

455.22 464.50 B: well [mn] i have a satellite and i i watch other kinds of programs mainly but like i say you know you always see the advertisements for those 

464.72 478.38 B: ah you know the the you know quote reality based t._v. and now they i was reading the other day in on the internet they're now they're gonna have a channel of nothing but reality based programs 

478.33 479.79 A: that's just stupid 

479.75 485.02 B: (( [laughter] ta- talk about you know [mn] th- that's )) 

484.26 487.33 A: some of it's not even reality that's not even how you live 

487.39 491.98 B: i know the you know these guys it's like i say you know these guys 

492.15 505.28 B: they're they're they're literally the well the the t._v. guys are doing what what the you know what they should be you know they're literally providing what everybody wants to watch but unfortunately these people need to get a life i think 

501.92 503.09 A: (( it's stupid it's )) 

505.19 506.22 A: dumb you 

505.43 507.14 B: (( you know 'cause ah )) 

507.34 514.27 B: ah i don't know what it was like with you but with me [laughter] i didn't get given nothing by my parents 

514.31 515.82 B: in fact my parents 

514.74 516.14 A: (( had to work for yours )) 

516.26 528.31 B: my parents you know if if they if they'd said if i'd said i was going to go out to you know be on a survivor program to try to get a million dollars my dad'd tell me look me dead in the eye and tell me get a life 

528.10 530.84 A: (( [laughter] like they would have laughed at me )) 

530.68 545.67 B: yeah you know that's 'cause our parents were brought up to to have to work your butt off and [mn] you know that's the only way you're gonna get anywhere and i can understand [mn] you know the urge is there you know who wa- who doesn't want to win the big lotto 

545.87 548.41 B: or something else but 

548.02 549.88 A: (( everybody wants that )) 

549.28 561.07 B: the yeah and i can u- i can see the reasoning behind going to well let's just you know because we're both familiar with it let's just say survivor 

560.96 573.67 B: you know 'cause they're saying okay we give you a half million dollars [mn] let's say if you can s- you know be the last one there well i can see that you know hey i wouldn't mind having that money and that's all i gotta do to do it you know [mn] that's a lot less 

567.19 568.11 A: yeah 

573.73 577.46 B: difficult than doing some of the other stuff you could really have to do [mn] 

577.70 578.86 B: um 

579.09 588.13 B: you know i've always heard people say they'd do almost anything to win a m- to get a million dollars but you know there are some things that you know 

585.77 587.24 A: that's ridiculous 

588.25 591.29 B: they i think they're just carrying it too far 

591.11 595.93 A: yeah i mean a little bit and it just gets worse and worse as the time goes on 

591.95 592.88 B: they're 

595.37 599.89 B: ah ah yeah and and the the thing is is is i
