227.03 228.73 B: [mn] not for what they're doing 

228.51 231.44 A: yeah i would agree with that though i would agree 

231.26 238.06 B: [mn] heights don't bother me at all except for the first fifteen or twenty five feet 

238.97 239.93 A: okay 

239.83 243.89 B: 'cause if you fall from there you get gimped out for life 

244.33 245.85 A: you you what for life

249.23 251.99 A: what do you mean what if you fall from fifteen twenty feet 

251.66 255.93 B: yeah above twenty feet it doesn't bother me any more 

255.32 258.53 A: because basically you think [mn] if you fall 

258.99 260.90 A: does- you know that's it 

260.32 262.07 B: that's it you're through 

261.98 263.19 A: [laughter] 

262.53 266.97 B: although i have seen seen people fall a lot further and get up 

266.89 267.84 A: okay 

267.64 269.06 B: (( [lipsmack] once )) 

269.41 272.20 B: maybe twenty years ago i seen a guy fall 

272.70 274.40 B: from thirty feet 

274.41 276.20 B: at least thirty feet 

275.72 276.93 A: mhm 

276.29 277.91 B: get up and run 

278.45 285.13 B: probably another twelve feet and he had two broken legs and a busted pelvis 

286.14 288.12 A: how where did he fall from 

287.54 291.09 B: he fell off a tank i work in an oil refinery 

290.47 291.44 A: (( oh okay )) 

291.11 293.94 B: they were cleaning the top of a tank 

293.33 294.13 A: (( ahah )) 

294.04 295.37 B: and i you 

295.42 296.67 B: know they'll 

296.56 301.62 B: bring people in as laborers that aren't really too swift 

301.38 302.28 A: okay 

301.42 311.71 B: and they were up there hosing the top of it and they hit an explosion light bulb or one of those light bulbs and it when it hit it exploded 

309.02 309.86 A: mhm 

311.64 317.98 B: 'cau- from the heat of the glass and he didn't know what it was and he turned and ran and ran right off the tank 

313.17 314.34 A: right 

318.69 327.02 B: but he had an air hose on that halfway down caught him flipped him around and then snapped so 

327.93 337.30 B: you know he did kind of a flip in the air and then when he fell and he hit and got up and run when he fell i thought he was dead and then i thought wow he got up and ran 

337.11 339.32 A: oh but he was running with broken legs 

338.97 340.58 B: with broken legs 

341.33 342.35 A: oh shit 

342.20 344.03 B: yeah [laughter] 

343.79 348.79 A: and how [laughter] and how many feet how many feet h- high was that 

348.42 351.17 B: [cough] the tank was at least thirty five feet 

350.72 357.55 A: okay so basically what what you're saying is is the ah the hose kind of broke his fall a little bit 

357.27 362.14 B: it didn't really break his fall it only flipped him around so he didn't land on his head 

361.90 364.01 A: oh okay okay 

363.76 372.35 B: 'cause the first i don't know the first thing he did it wasn't the explosion didn't rock him off the tank he panicked and ran off the tank 

369.00 369.81 A: (( ahah )) 

372.33 373.28 A: (( wow )) 

373.05 384.90 B: so he got like like three feet off the tank and then shh started straight down but when he got almost down there the- they had a breathing air because ah the gas up there 

384.28 386.21 A: (( yeah )) 

385.34 390.88 B: caught him flipped him and then it it didn't hold him it just snapped 

390.94 393.55 A: okay i gotcha and how's he doing now 

393.55 395.43 B: ah he lived 

395.47 396.59 A: yeah 

395.96 401.12 B: but i never seen him again you know he was a contractor who came in to clean the tank 

400.51 401.50 A: okay 

401.49 402.80 B: but 

403.13 404.74 A: sounds like a dangerous job 

405.05 416.64 B: well it doesn't happen often and now they a- whenever they go up there they all have to have a o._s._h._a. has given 'em [lipsmack] the thing that makes like a bungee jumper like the rock climbers have 

416.05 417.15 A: yeah of course 

416.90 421.39 B: yeah so now they have that on everything so 

420.96 423.47 A: oh okay so it's a little bit safer 

423.47 433.51 B: quite a bit but that was my first i wish they should have had that on t._v. or those other ones like them ah america's stupid videos are they reality based t._v.
