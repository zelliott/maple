12.04 13.97 B: (( pretty good )) 

13.43 17.21 A: yeah so i guess we've got to talk about personal habits relating to 

17.23 19.26 A: which one do we feel is worse 

19.33 20.63 B: i think smoking 

19.56 22.11 A: over eating drinking etc etc 

21.62 23.64 B: yeah we've got quite a few topics 

23.71 27.23 A: yeah you got any ah any thoughts off the top of the head 

27.14 28.62 B: (( ah well i think )) 

28.68 33.46 B: i think smoking actually and actually lack of exercise was part of the top two 

33.67 35.78 A: yeah i actually agree with you there um 

36.08 38.36 A: i don't smoke cigarettes myself 

38.72 41.76 A: and ah i don't ever plan on doing it 

42.42 45.45 A: and i think it's pretty bad bottom line ah 

45.24 50.07 B: yeah i mean i've always been an athlete so it's like um smoking would just 

50.10 57.02 B: my aerobics um and actually my workouts and i wear contacts also so it also bothers my eye- eye as a manner of speaking 

57.02 66.71 A: okay yeah i'm i i'm a former athlete i'm a college student now i don't play sports any more but i was pretty active all through junior high school and high school 

66.99 72.71 A: and um yeah i don't like to smoke i still like to stay in shape and i don't think anything's wrong with over eating 

73.57 79.55 A: a- ah like i was thinking i was having a hard time choosing between over eating and lack of exercise 

79.71 81.12 B: mhm 

79.79 86.26 A: like i would you know you can you can over eat and still exercise and stay in shape 

86.82 89.52 A: but you can't really if you don't exercise you 

89.60 90.86 A: can't over eat 

90.78 92.84 B: yeah i agree there it's sort of like a 

92.91 96.63 B: actually you know if you exercise the more you exercise the more you can eat though 

96.57 110.33 B: that's the way i always look at it and then um you know everybody should need to know know their own body in a manner of speaking but i know this this um i'm i'm forty nine but i've i'm pretty lucky i've always been an athlete and ah i've always 

110.50 114.71 B: been able to manage my weight pretty much but but most people can't it's 

114.85 125.86 B: amazing they don't really understand food as a manner of speaking i always thought that you know your body's like a car you've got to throw in you know put in your car you throw in your gas oils you're going to have problems 

125.45 126.62 A: right 

126.27 138.65 B: and ah ah strange i when i was a when i used to compete a lot i used to eat actually about eight thousand calories per day and now that i'm older i don't train as much i'm down to about half of that so 

136.95 139.05 A: (( mm )) 

139.65 146.93 A: ah so do you have a hard time adjusting your diet as you get older like does your metabolism actually slow down noticeably 

146.13 157.51 B: [noise] not mine because i've a i've always did aerobics when i did train i was i was a body builder and a power lifter on the national level that's why i came out that's why i came out in los angeles 

154.89 155.92 A: wow 

157.59 159.61 B: so um 

159.95 170.95 B: and now that i'm forty nine years old actually i don't actually well i don't eat when i was i just don't eat as much b- m- and ah a lot of people actually when they're when they're training either either eating more and then 

170.98 180.45 B: if they don't train they're still eating more but for me it's just the opposite it's like if i don't i don't train i don't have to eat as much then my and my weight comes down a little bit but not by much 

173.11 174.05 A: right 

180.75 190.08 A: so your metabol- i find metabolism slow down naturally so it sounds like the more if you if you stay active then your metabolism stays 

190.00 199.60 B: yeah you keep you i think better i think it keeps you running better you know that's that's the way i look at it i mean i ah the more ah to me a calorie's a calorie so it's like um 

190.26 190.94 A: as 

199.89 208.98 B: it doesn't matter what you eat it's just total calories that's the way i always look at it even though some people say you you got to eat so much protein or carbohydrates or that or whatever 

209.41 210.36 B: (( i don't know )) 

209.57 210.42 A: right 

210.41 218.61 B: i've always um yeah i've been lucky in a manner of speaking but i my whole family is heavy ah has to lose weight and i'm just the opposite 

218.73 220.08 A: oh okay 

219.98 226.86 B: and i'm pretty i'm still pretty big for my size and but but because of my my good muscles it's just old muscle i guess 

227.10 229.01 A: right 

229.19 236.62 B: now i no- i notice she said they mentioned drinking though i i don't have a drinking problem anymore because after after a certain age i sort of got 

236.82 242.11 B: had the dry heaves for two or three days so i that eliminated my ah drinking problem really quick 

242.46 244.54 A: you dry heaved for two or three days 

244.10 253.71 B: oh yeah where right when i got about twenty nine years old i i just couldn't handle drinking as much as i could i mean in college i used to drink all the time you know a case of beer or a bottle of 

253.94 256.11 B: whisky or vodka or whatever 

256.22 258.08 B: but then right about twenty nine i 

258.20 261.68 B: i used to it just used to wipe me out for two or three days and um 

261.86 264.81 B: (( i'd lose about eight or nine pounds )) 

264.23 267.60 A: wow i guess your body just couldn't handle it anymore 

267.20 277.90 B: no exactly i could have a couple of drinks now but now i sort of nurse them you know in a manner of speaking but i ah yeah for me i i know drinking's a big problem in this country but um 

270.92 272.21 A: (( mm )) 

278.14 280.09 B: ah that that's not you know 

280.49 288.15 B: and um they do consider drinking and drinking is a drug in a manner of speaking but it's more acceptable but a lot of people get hurt with drinking so 

287.71 289.37 A: especially i mean 

289.75 293.30 A: i think drinking is pretty dangerous because 

293.55 297.92 A: people so many people do it and it's so widely accepted it's 

296.99 298.03 B: oh yes i 

298.04 299.04 A: so you do 

298.21 299.94 B: i agree there 

299.62 306.04 A: so so to fall into the trap of alcoholism and the funny thing is i drink a lot too i'm in college 

305.86 309.57 B: mm yeah i'd it was every day in college [noise]

312.25 319.90 A: this is my senior year of college so i have less responsibilities now than i did in the past and i drink a bottle maybe four times a week 

316.68 318.20 B: mhm 

320.85 323.77 A: and it's about and i can see it

371.91 372.91 A: wow 

375.54 382.88 A: yeah i've always i've always wondered what it's like to go to a school like that because my school is considered the the call it the ivy 

382.93 384.86 B: mhm 

384.19 391.13 A: so that our friends who go to bigger schools that our party life is is nothing compared to what they do over there 

392.92 398.86 B: yeah you know at that age you just learn to well you're away from home and i guess everybody goes sort of wild 

398.70 400.25 A: (( yeah )) 

399.77 401.81 B: yeah i mean but you 

402.53 415.48 B: know actually in this country i one of since i was a training out here you know a lot of and i'm surprised they say california a lot of people are a lot fit compared to other parts of the country but i still i think there's a lot of people over here that need to lose weight 

415.31 416.27 A: really 

415.94 419.49 B: oh yeah including the kids kids nowadays because they don't exercise 

419.64 429.12 B: sixty there are sixty seventy percent are actually out of shape they can't even do like a mile on a just even these little things that are con- considered simple thirty years ago 

429.18 430.17 A: wow 

430.02 438.82 B: i actually think it's just a lack of nutrition or you know there's a well there's a lot of different things but people really need especially the kids they ah 

439.26 441.87 B: they need better eating habits 

441.24 448.91 A: yeah that's one thing that i've been thinking about is the way the f- like the f- the food quality is really really on the 

449.06 456.46 A: really on the down slide in this country if you look at like things like ah restaurants like mcdonalds that are spreading like wildfire 

456.52 460.14 A: and the food they serve isn't even food it's it's pure garbage 

460.38 464.93 B: i we are so used to fast food nowadays especially in california that ah 

465.12 468.23 B: oh it's hard to get aw- get away from fast food 

467.58 470.92 A: yeah and as much as i don't like it i find myself 

471.14 474.57 A: being drawn to it because it's just everywhere and it's so convenient 

474.29 481.29 B: yeah well actually in college that's when i started gaining weight but i needed to gain weight because of the but i lived in the dorms the first couple of years 

481.18 482.18 A: right 

481.60 484.00 B: you get to eat as much as you want but 

485.11 487.59 B: (( yeah in this country )) 

488.24 501.15 B: coming third recent tests have showed that kids nowadays are getting kind of very depressed at being overweight even to the point where it's like um it's almost like they're taking depression on to have cancer that was just recently recently stated 

500.61 501.55 A: really 

501.19 503.92 B: oh yeah i just saw it a couple of weeks ago 

503.90 508.03 A: wait so what so what are they saying that the depression was a result of the over eating 

507.85 518.45 B: ah yes yeah and bad self-esteem self-respect you know a lot of the a lot of kids nowadays are you know sometimes they put them on ritalin or other different drugs or um 

518.49 521.14 B: sometimes sometimes even antidepressants you know 

521.09 523.87 A: yeah they over medicate them 

523.37 527.32 B: over medicate and that's they're starting at an earlier age nowadays 

527.94 529.93 A: that's kind of scary because 

530.16 536.37 A: i don't know i don't i don't really trust the medical establishment insofar as their mass production of 

536.71 539.96 A: of pills and and and 

540.22 542.71 A: and ah antibiotics 

543.04 545.12 B: yeah well actually in 

545.22 556.36 B: when i was training actually the more that i trained the more i learned about medicine tell you the truth and ah all my all my doctors i would tell them tell them what what i needed um 

556.39 563.66 B: and actually i came out pretty good compared to most of my friends some of them are already some of them are even dead or you know have ah kidney problems or heart problems or 

563.50 564.40 A: really 

564.18 575.71 B: yeah i i took steroids at about ten years when i was a competitor but i didn't take i took the least ones that are least an- anabol- or ana- anogen- anogenic 

575.69 582.14 B: anabolic affects your which is good for the protein part but the the side effects i took i always took the least amount 

582.59 587.32 B: and tell you the truth i i it must have worked because i still have all my hair i have clean skin 

587.41 591.13 B: i have ah no kidney problems i have no heart problems 

590.48 593.37 A: you said some of your friends are dead but so they probably
