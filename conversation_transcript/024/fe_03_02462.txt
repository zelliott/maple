70.66 76.84 B: and ah [mn] and i only watched the survival type one i'll be ten 

77.08 84.73 B: so but i i can't understand why people watch the fear factor ones they seem really

92.97 94.23 B: why 

94.74 103.38 A: i don't know i mean they're just entertaining that that's all it is i don't think that there's really that these people are really in danger or anything 

95.35 95.91 B: (( [mn] )) 

98.82 99.76 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

103.40 106.83 A: so [mn] it's just pure entertainment to me 

106.40 112.34 B: i don't think they're in danger but i think it's so disgusting i mean like eating bugs or eating 

112.39 122.49 B: stomach lining or the one i saw the ad for was burying somebody in the ground as if it was a grave and when i saw that it just totally 

112.73 114.60 A: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

120.06 120.85 A: ooh 

121.57 124.24 A: that's kind of nasty anyway [mn] 

122.84 128.06 B: i don't know i think people are desensitized or or something or they need 

128.80 132.83 B: [mn] maybe they're just so far away from their own feelings and 

132.69 134.02 A: maybe 

133.11 138.03 B: the natural part of life that they just go to 

138.52 142.44 B: things where they just i don't know i mean i don't i don't really get that 

142.56 145.25 A: [mn] i've seen the um 

145.63 148.82 A: what is it ah meet the meet my parents or something 

148.12 149.24 B: mhm 

148.84 150.22 A: do you know this one 

150.05 153.47 B: i didn't see that one but i saw the ads for it 

152.75 155.56 A: yeah it's like um um 

155.24 157.59 B: oh i did too i saw it once 

157.14 159.08 A: oh so you know what it's about 

158.07 159.16 B: yeah 

158.85 172.76 A: yeah i thought that was pretty funny though i mean i personally i don't know i don't believe that they're really real 'cause i know people like here that have parci- participated in like blind date or meet the parents or something 

165.67 166.61 B: mhm 

172.38 173.69 B: mhm 

172.75 178.18 A: and a lot of times these people are like actors or wannabe actors and they get paid like 

178.37 187.13 A: a little bit for it so they do it and they kinda like cheat [mn] so i don't really believe that it's actually re- reality t._v. 

179.52 180.60 B: mhm 

183.08 184.05 B: (( mm )) 

186.42 187.52 B: mhm 

187.38 190.42 A: so i don't know i just think it's funny 

190.20 198.30 B: yeah well i've watched i've gotten sucked into the the bachelor one and the bachelorette and i'm watching the one now on 

194.97 195.79 A: (( ahah )) 

198.09 212.02 B: [mn] the bachelor one but actually this is the last one i'll watch because i- it's not very interesting and to me it seems really ridiculous that you could expect to meet someone and know if they're the right person to marry 

212.00 213.49 B: and that but 

212.23 215.43 A: yeah i agree i agree totally on this one i mean 

214.45 225.62 B: and i think they are real i mean i think those people who do go there maybe they're thinking it's a bluff but i think they're once they get there they do kind of you know hope that the guy's going to choose them and 

225.52 226.69 A: you think so 

225.86 226.44 B: (( [mn] )) 

226.36 240.16 B: yeah i really think s- i mean fr- i think from what i've h- i've seen them on like the past people um [lipsmack] the bachelorette people i've seen 'em on oprah and stuff and i think it's it's sincere that these women do 

232.73 233.93 A: mhm 

240.03 244.47 B: start really believing in yeah i wanna marry this guy or whatever 

244.20 246.98 A: [lipsmack] maybe yeah you're right 

245.19 253.94 B: but i don't see how they can do even that though i mean i couldn't do it even just to be filmed on a date [laughter] would i'd just be uncomfortable 

251.66 255.02 A: yeah totally yeah yeah me too 

254.73 263.66 B: but it's funny because so many of my friends i had mentioned that i was watching say the bachelorette and then it's like oh yeah my husband and i are watching that too it's like 

255.05 255.75 A: so 

263.45 270.45 B: i just just channel surfing one night and i stumbled across it and i just couldn't believe it was happening you know i mean 

264.24 265.93 A: (( [laughter] ahah )) 

269.92 270.93 A: [mn] 

270.35 277.50 B: but you're kidding these people are dating and they're gonna show these dates and then they're gonna go meet their parents and 

277.36 290.66 B: so i mean i i did get sucked into it and i i was really embarrassed to admit that i did watch it but i did but now that i'm watching this latest bachelor [mn] which i chose to watch mainly because i had been to the winery and [lipsmack] i know the 

282.72 283.85 A: [laughter] 

290.48 303.59 B: wine maker who was at andrew firestone's parents' winery so and i've stayed at the property so i was just curious to see scenes from the property and that but it's pretty boring i mean the women it's 

300.85 301.71 A: (( ahah )) 

303.55 313.92 B: are pretty it's it's not interesting and that but i think they're a big hit on the other hand but i could more easily watch those than the fear factor ones and the 

309.73 310.66 A: yeah 

314.43 316.99 B: [mn] they're to me those are disgusting 

314.78 325.18 A: yeah they're more more yeah that's true i mean they're more interesting to me too like um all these dating shows i think they're more interesting than yeah like survivor or something like that 

321.02 322.11 B: mhm 

323.86 325.77 B: mhm mhm 

325.08 331.46 A: but um i don't know maybe to me because i think that they're not real i think they're so funny but if 

329.30 329.86 B: (( [mn] )) 

330.31 331.83 B: they're just funny 

331.73 342.23 A: yeah but if they are like if it was real i i would feel it's weird too like who would look for a partner you know like on a t._v. show in front of the whole you know no 

338.63 339.67 B: mhm 

341.72 343.15 B: mhm 

342.51 351.61 A: i mean i would never like want to be filmed on a real date you know but if i felt it was just you know because i got paid for it and you know then there'd be a whole different story [mn] 

348.34 350.19 B: mhm yeah 

351.01 356.20 B: yeah but the fear ones you find that they are entertaining for some reason 

354.98 355.78 A: (( ahah )) 

356.41 357.63 B: [mn] i wonder 

356.63 361.67 A: um kind of i mean yeah kind of i have to admit kind of 

360.25 373.28 B: i know i mean i'm forty seven but i have a group of students who work for me who are in their twenties and they get a kick out of 'em and they find 'em entertaining but to me it's not entertaining it's so disgusting 

366.28 367.82 A: mhm 

373.31 375.76 B: i just don't it seems like it 

374.92 383.04 A: and then it's also [mn] you know what it is it's easier sometimes when i watch t._v. because if i want to watch like a movie [mn] 

379.98 381.03 B: mhm 

382.24 383.28 B: mhm 

382.92 395.76 A: or something like this if i like kind of like like start watching it after it's been been on for like half an hour or so [mn] it's kind of hard for me to get into it plus i really have to watch closely 

388.99 389.81 B: mhm 

390.43 391.48 B: mhm 

395.39 396.45 B: mhm 

395.84 408.19 A: to um you know to be able to follow the movie [mn] while if there's a t._v. sh- if there's like a reality show i can you know start it when it's like you know after it's been on for like half an hour and then i can 

399.36 400.27 B: mhm 

408.01 413.28 A: i don't know do something else at the same time because it doesn't require that much attention 

412.68 414.45 B: oh that's yeah 

414.01 420.27 A: that's another reason why i sometimes watch um stuff like that because it's 

420.32 426.00 A: yeah 'cause it's kind of like you can do it you don't really have to pay close attention in order to be 

420.91 422.06 B: oh 

424.80 426.10 B: oh 

426.22 434.26 B: that's very that's a good point maybe th- maybe that's why people i think people are used to just um 

426.51 428.18 A: have you ever thought about this 

434.60 438.78 B: you know not thinking a long time about something i think we're hit 

438.87 444.01 B: with so much by the media that you know before i don't know you could 

444.06 445.79 B: [mn] learn about 

446.04 457.98 B: or see something that would have an impact on you for a long time and now you just forget i mean you see some horrific thing and then there is something else that you're bombarded with so y- y- just nothing 

449.39 450.51 A: mhm 

452.51 454.64 A: yeah 

458.29 463.49 B: you don't keep an emotional response that lasts very long 

463.91 464.94 A: yeah 

464.29 475.95 B: [lipsmack] there a long time ago i mean maybe twenty years ago or so they made that one video the i think it was called we can heal the world or something and a group of movie stars got together and they all sang 

475.89 484.02 B: this song together and i think it was part of a fund raising or ah you know make people aware of [mn] 

481.31 482.17 A: (( ahah )) 

484.57 487.65 B: i can't even remember what the topic was now but y- 

487.67 495.32 B: you know making the world a better place and that thing had an impact for a long time and you saw it it was played for a long time but 

495.09 505.35 B: now i don't think you could do a video like that any more 'cause it's like you see something once that might impact you for five minutes and then you just know that there's going to be something else and [mn] 

505.63 511.38 A: kind of yeah plus i don't know it's like for me t._v. is kind of just to relax 

506.68 507.67 B: mhm 

510.80 511.83 B: mhm 

511.40 518.82 A: so um you know sometimes i want to cook at the same time or i want to i don't know fold the laundry at the same time 

518.60 533.23 A: so i cannot you know devote my whole attention to whatever's on t._v. 'cause you know there's other stuff that you know i just want to do at the same time so if i'm watching like news or if i'm watching you know like a talk show or something i can do everything at once 

518.71 519.65 B: mhm 

523.31 524.51 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

533.11 536.43 A: i- if i'm watching a movie or if i'm watching i don't know 

537.04 540.89 A: something that you know i can't really do it [mn] so 

539.65 540.74 B: right 

541.02 545.04 B: so it really is a reflection of our lives today 

541.15 542.17 A: (( sometimes )) 

544.37 546.25 A: maybe yeah 

544.83 557.66 B: and it i mean it seems like that's a very good point that that's why those people can watch those shows is they don't take that long and [mn] and you can kind of be entertained but yet you know you don't have to follow a plot like you say so 

557.24 560.95 A: no yeah maybe that's i mean that's what it is for me 

560.65 561.68 B: mhm 

562.01 564.17 A: (( so i don't know )) 

562.98 566.51 B: hard to know like what it's making our children think though 

567.56 577.12 B: you know 'cause i think t._v. does impact you when i was in college i didn't watch t._v. i didn't have a tv and i remember coming home for the summer and watching t._v. and i watched the streets of san francisco 

567.58 568.55 A: mm 

576.94 585.36 B: and i was home alone and i was totally scared it was just it was a detective show and i had seen that all through high school and i loved it 

580.02 581.31 A: really 

584.38 586.33 A: (( i know the streets of san francisco )) 

585.30 592.23 B: yeah and but then if you don't watch t._v. and you see that stuff you realize it does really impact you 

592.51 594.91 B: so to see a bunch of people 

595.11 599.89 B: humiliating themselves or eating worms or you know being
