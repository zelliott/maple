32.31 38.68 B: okay well i i've watched uh joe millionaire and i've watched uh the survivor i don't i 

35.00 36.20 A: mhm 

37.57 38.66 A: okay 

40.04 44.35 B: i i w- when the survivor first came on i watched it religiously 

43.91 45.23 A: okay yeah 

44.36 47.12 B: and now i watch it uh off and on 

46.48 57.70 A: that's kinda how i am too 'cause it's w- wearing out you now it's kind of wearing out its welcome a little bit but i but i still like it but big brother last year was better than the first year so that but i always watch it even though it's a little boring 

47.91 49.17 B: yeah 

57.30 60.35 B: well apparently i didn't even watch big brother what's it about 

59.76 66.16 A: um it it they they just put a ca- put like seven people in a house and and they each vote

73.07 74.35 B: [laughter] 

73.33 85.78 A: so uh you know i i but i like them i i think if they they're talking about [mn] reality network i probably would watch it [laughter] i don't know but i enjoy it and i think the reason why [sigh] is um 

85.86 94.92 A: it's fun to watch other people just go in their day to day lives you know when when the camera's on i think sometimes if they're interesting personalities 

92.65 94.68 B: you know i think it it [cough] 

95.38 104.11 B: i think although it shows that uh when you when you take a group of people uh especially of say uh seven or eight or ten people 

104.20 106.03 B: close them up in a house 

105.71 106.85 A: mhm 

106.44 111.65 B: and uh y- you know the old saying that familiarity breeds disgust 

111.20 112.99 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

112.43 116.26 B: uh it doesn't take long 'til they they snipping at each other [mn] 

115.60 125.03 A: yeah especially when there's nothing else to take their minds off that you know uh there's no reading and you know i can't even i couldn't stand it i don't think [laughter] jus- 

118.91 120.70 B: that's exactly right 

123.02 123.95 B: yeah 

124.04 133.03 B: oh no i don't think i could either n- n- knowing that uh uh everything i do uh i- is being uh [mn] i- is gonna be on television 

125.81 127.13 A: yeah 

132.54 138.33 A: no i know yeah so and but i like joe millionaire 'cause it had it had a 

133.44 134.23 B: [laughter] 

138.45 140.48 A: twist at the end that was fun 

140.62 148.97 A: and i do like the ones where they do stunts and stuff sometimes too but i don't think i i haven't watched the bachelor 

149.11 149.96 A: yet 

150.01 159.32 B: i have watched the bachelor maybe three episodes in fact i watched it last night he's d- [mn] he is down now to three p- three girls 

150.14 150.96 A: so 

155.88 157.06 A: (( [noise] did ya )) 

158.21 163.41 A: oh you know what i'm watching now um mr personality the one with the masks 

163.06 164.54 B: oh yeah yeah 

163.60 166.26 A: [laughter] now that's fun 

164.61 168.41 B: i watched that listen i watched that for the first time w- was it on last night 

167.80 170.71 A: i think it was monday night but y- 

169.09 171.68 B: oh whenever it was i watched it for the first time 

171.08 173.94 A: [laughter] yeah that was fun i thought 

172.55 176.69 B: and i thought then how d- can these guys go around with these masks on all the time 

175.82 177.21 A: oh i know 

176.84 177.73 B: yeah 

177.98 181.18 A: so i think that might end up being a hit 

180.45 184.44 B: well i kinda of um i kinda liked uh joe millionaire uh 

183.66 185.97 A: yeah that was my favorite too [noise] 

185.31 186.46 B: uh 

186.89 189.61 B: i i'm i think he put on a pretty good show 

189.00 190.43 A: yeah he did 

190.48 194.15 B: but you know really i can understand 

194.47 195.66 B: uh 

195.82 207.41 B: for instance uh this boy uh d- w- what's his name his firestone's his name uh they you know he he's a uh one of the heirs to the firestone fortune 

200.98 201.78 A: oh 

207.13 208.16 A: okay 

207.63 211.41 B: but they own uh he owns uh vineyards in california 

210.88 211.94 A: oh 

211.42 213.71 B: but i what i'm wondering is 

213.60 218.12 A: oh okay i didn't see what they did i knew one one guy was a motivational speaker 

218.15 220.51 A: but i didn't see what the rest of 'em did 

220.31 222.62 B: no i'm talk th- this is the bachelor 

222.28 226.64 A: oh okay oh i see yeah i haven't seen that yet [cough] 

225.51 229.37 B: yeah where where he started off with twenty four girls and now he's down with three 

229.44 230.96 A: oh okay 

230.48 234.59 B: and actually it seems as though he is serious in finding trying to find a wife 

234.64 240.63 A: i know but i was disappointed with joe millionaire 'cause you thought they i thought that was they were gonna b- stay together and they didn't 

240.04 242.35 B: i'm glad you said that 'cause i was too 

241.80 248.62 A: yeah so i don't you know the i think they were both faking it a little at the end that bugged me [laughter] 

247.25 251.31 B: [mn] was it uh the last i heard let's see so she was from kansas 

251.35 255.30 A: oh yeah uh p- pennsylvania th- the reason i know that is because 

254.22 257.20 B: oh she's from pennsylvania sure sure 

255.48 263.13 A: yeah she's from like langhorn or something 'cause that's where i'm from pennsylvania so i remembered that yeah she seemed like a nice lady 

257.78 258.75 B: okay 

259.34 260.27 B: okay 

260.71 261.66 B: okay 

262.75 266.11 B: but they didn't uh uh [mn] 

266.34 269.21 B: i i thought they were gonna hit it off better than that 

268.57 274.96 A: yeah yeah me too but i guess it's h- h- it went to his head [laughter] you know 

269.61 270.61 B: yeah 

273.87 287.38 B: [laughter] i tell you what though they're getting to point uh you know uh if one station has a hit or or or one broadcasting company has a hit then they all uh eventually they all have uh s- something along the same lines 

287.03 288.49 A: yeah and that 

287.51 290.05 B: and uh and that's what's happening now 

289.68 300.75 A: yeah i think so i think they're gonna have to keep coming up with unique stuff because i think it's gonna start getting boring just like you said you watched survivor religiously the first time i'm watching it less and less you know now too 

296.58 298.44 B: right right 

300.22 307.72 B: and that's exactly the way i doing it and i think that's that's true with probably uh the majority of the people that that originally started watching these things 

301.90 303.26 A: mhm 

307.31 319.91 A: yeah yeah that's kinda disappointing 'cause i i mean i would never miss it you know now i'm just like oh well we can tape it or not you know and i don't have tivo or anything but some people tape all that stuff but i don't think i would 

318.60 319.51 B: that 

319.58 324.57 B: [cough] that's kinda like when i was much younger incidentally incidentally i'm seventy nine years old 

324.01 325.93 A: oh how'd you hear about this [sigh] 

325.57 330.15 B: [laughter] a friend of mine uh w- an email friend of mine 

329.57 332.11 A: oh for goodness sakes that's great 

331.52 341.45 B: who i've never met uh she she's a girl that lives in i say a girl i think she's oh probably fifty s- something but anyway she lives in san antonio 

332.93 333.58 A: (( mm )) 

338.42 339.51 A: okay
