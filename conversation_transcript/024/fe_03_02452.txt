54.76 55.84 B: right

61.34 62.34 A: (( ahah )) 

61.75 64.18 B: to the extreme 

64.03 66.15 A: yeah and kind of ran with it

75.72 76.41 B: (( mhm )) 

77.48 79.27 B: i i think it's um

108.98 110.19 B: mhm

119.79 122.03 B: you know and i i i don't know i think 

122.05 124.69 B: t._v. just kind of glamorizes 

124.91 131.17 B: everything but you know it's like when he's walking behind the dog cussing because he has to pick pick up the poop or 

130.75 131.83 A: (( ahah ))
