0.91 2.68 A: hi i'm diane 

2.38 3.96 B: i am julien 

4.03 6.31 A: hi that's funny our names 

5.86 7.52 B: (( [laughter] yes it is )) 

6.53 8.85 A: kind of rhyme in a way 

7.67 9.57 B: (( it's similar yes )) 

9.71 12.80 A: boy they went over the topic so fast 

12.48 18.09 B: well i i only caught a little bit of it it said something like which do you think is the worst 

17.81 19.19 A: mhm 

18.12 25.39 B: i think it mentioned alcohol it mentioned cigarette smoking gossiping overeating and no exercise 

25.30 26.97 A: right right 

26.11 28.30 B: but i don't find it 

28.70 33.78 B: terrible i mean it's more like personal habit it should be up to an individual 

33.84 39.66 B: and ah as long as it doesn't offend me i i see nothing wrong with it 

39.07 40.05 A: mhm 

40.40 44.66 B: you know unless they're gossiping about something that it's really hurtful 

40.45 41.14 A: but 

44.44 47.14 A: boy gossip can really hurt somebody 

46.87 47.89 B: yes 

47.83 48.76 A: um 

48.20 56.99 B: ah ah you know but some people really gossip for social reasons rather than for you know hurtful or vindictive reasons 

57.31 66.01 A: right but when it gets back to the other person and it almost always does somehow or other it always gets back to 'em in a different form that 

66.17 68.18 B: that's the unfortunate part 

66.19 68.76 A: that seems to hurt them and 

69.04 70.89 A: (( but i just um )) 

72.22 73.25 A: i don't know 

73.31 81.26 A: i don't know but i gossip myself but and it's hard not to gossip and spread rumors about other people 

78.95 79.51 B: (( mm )) 

81.00 82.11 B: mhm 

81.94 84.08 A: but it sure can make enemies 

84.43 91.36 B: well i wouldn't rate that as being the worst i think the worst for me will probably be um excessive drinking 

91.77 100.66 B: i mean the ramification of that is that um you know you get into accidents people get maimed or even die while gossip will hurt 

92.25 93.20 A: well 

99.00 100.32 A: oh yes 

100.39 105.12 A: and you know what usually m- i always say that um 

100.81 101.67 B: [laughter] 

105.51 107.11 A: that drinking 

107.48 109.24 A: and driving it's 

109.81 114.74 A: they always hurt somebody else the innocent person and the drunk never gets 

111.91 112.72 B: yes 

115.21 119.13 A: you know usually doesn't get hurt as often as somebody else at least 

117.03 118.04 B: mhm 

118.44 119.26 B: yes 

119.24 122.69 A: it seems that way to me and boy 

121.58 130.80 B: and it's like y- you as a person doesn't have control over it you know you can always walk away from a smoker you can always stop participate in gossiping 

128.34 129.33 A: right 

130.85 133.68 A: right that's true that's true those are both true 

130.88 131.96 B: (( you know you can )) 

132.22 142.77 B: you know all the others yeah you have control over those situations while with ah drunk driving not so much drinking but drunk driving the the effect of it ah 

135.61 136.99 A: it's 

142.32 145.07 A: hard to get away you don't know um 

145.67 148.69 A: you don't know they're there sometimes until it's too late 

147.10 147.98 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

148.86 155.83 B: and that's the direct impact the indirect impact is being the member of the family you know you're hurt by the loved one 

156.03 158.51 B: so there is a a um 

156.19 157.53 A: oh yeah 

158.97 160.84 B: an indirect impact 

160.59 162.96 A: there sure can be a lot of um 

164.06 167.53 A: [mn] a lot of hurt feelings and disappointments 

167.43 169.27 B: yeah this this ah 

168.25 171.19 A: when you have a alcoholic in the family 

171.01 173.16 B: (( mhm oh i'm sorry to hear that but )) 

173.05 176.11 A: it's um yeah 

173.82 175.98 B: um but you know i guess 

176.49 177.99 B: we pull together [laughter] 

176.59 177.93 A: i've tried to date 

178.07 181.03 A: i've tried to date some alcoholics and ah 

181.70 183.33 A: it's it's 

183.67 185.81 A: an uphill battle for sure 

185.85 188.42 B: (( and it's not easy to ah )) 

188.46 190.79 B: to help them get off that habit 

190.95 193.93 A: oh no you you can't really um 

196.72 202.31 A: they can't stop drinking for you they have to do it for themselves and 

201.72 203.65 B: yes that's the first step 

202.43 205.86 A: smoking too ah that took me a long long 

207.60 209.50 A: a real long time to learn 

209.37 210.19 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

209.59 211.50 A: that 

211.54 217.50 A: um you know i'd say well if you love me you won't drink and then you turn around and they're drunk again 

217.58 220.43 A: but they can't do it for somebody else 

220.44 224.70 A: you can't stop smoking or drinking for somebody else or stop any habit 

220.50 221.71 B: (( well you see )) 

223.39 224.10 B: right 

224.39 225.85 B: (( mhm and it's not but )) 

224.80 226.47 A: or start any habit 

226.60 230.18 A: like exercising or overeating or smoking or drinking 

229.88 235.87 B: (( it's yeah a a lot of it requires an enormous amount of discipline )) 

235.94 239.30 B: and it's not that they don't love you that they don't want to do it 

239.34 240.52 A: mhm 

239.89 244.18 B: i i'm sure that they do love the person it's just that 

244.91 247.05 B: it it it's like any addiction 

247.22 249.89 B: (( you you have no control over it mhm )) 

247.46 248.43 A: yes 

249.59 250.60 A: right 

250.85 253.66 A: well i really believe after um 

253.91 260.12 A: attending al anon for many years on and off and going to open a._a. meetings with 

260.64 264.25 A: people that i've tried to date guys i've tried to date that um 

264.78 269.49 A: that they're it is a disease all those things are diseases and ah 

270.01 275.86 A: and it does run in families alcoholism especially runs in families 

275.47 280.39 B: but what can you do you know as a ah a partner or as a friend 

280.70 282.38 A: (( [mn] um )) 

283.19 288.73 A: the best thing that al anon has taught me is to not be an enabler 

288.95 289.99 A: to 

289.08 290.01 B: mhm 

291.12 294.33 A: you know not be the person to call in and say oh 

294.37 300.54 A: you know make up the the story about they're sick today instead of they're drunk [laughter] you know i'm drunk to come to work 

299.16 299.84 B: (( yes mm )) 

300.46 301.77 B: right right 

300.89 305.06 A: and making excuses for 'em or going to actually you know 

305.14 310.19 A: even buy the alcohol for 'em some people enable by doing that 

309.83 310.84 B: mhm 

310.38 314.27 A: and sometimes that's a hard line to draw because 

315.20 316.62 A: okay say i'm 

316.73 318.76 A: dating an alcoholic 

319.73 331.21 A: and he's partly drunk and he wants more alcohol well do i let him go out and drive the car and maybe kill somebody or do i just go get him another beer 

331.45 334.18 A: you know i d- sometimes i don't know what to do 

332.38 333.22 B: right 

334.21 344.97 B: that's a difficult spot because you don't want to participate in it but at the same time you don't want to leave him in a position where he can really do more harm 

345.30 349.54 A: right i know i know and it is really 

349.62 353.97 A: and i just hate that having top tiptoe around the alcoholic 

354.31 367.08 A: you know be quiet because daddy has a headache you know and instead of he's you know has a hangover [laughter] pretending to the kids and to your neighbors that everybody's everything's just fine in our house 

360.04 361.04 B: (( mhm yeah i know yeah )) 

367.06 371.64 B: it's it's a bit like you know um like cheating yourself mm 

371.58 375.98 A: right oh it is it is lying to yourself cheating yourself 

376.16 383.17 A: and you ultimately i guess get to you're you know you're cheating everybody else that you come in contact with 

383.66 386.19 A: because you have to keep the lie going 

386.06 386.99 B: mhm 

387.71 388.71 A: and ah 

387.85 391.10 B: well i i hope you're out of that relationship 

390.85 392.44 A: oh i am i am 

392.41 395.89 B: and you have someone who is very deserving of you mm mm 

392.63 393.78 A: and

401.46 403.51 A: finally is sober 

403.72 407.72 A: but it took him all the way to losing all of his fingers 

407.95 412.36 A: for a- a- he froze his hands off one time in a drunk 

412.24 413.22 B: mhm 

412.94 414.09 A: (( and ah )) 

414.45 416.24 A: i've seen him since then 

416.76 419.40 A: and boy he sure isn't the 

419.75 422.53 A: really cute guy i met four or five years ago

422.84 430.13 A: anymore and no fingers and still holding down a job and o- you know been sober for a couple of years but 

430.81 434.26 A: in a way it seems like he has more excuse to drink now 

434.74 435.93 B: but he doesn't 

436.40 438.13 A: no he says he doesn't 

437.97 438.97 B: (( but he doesn't )) 

439.04 440.85 B: (( well let's ah )) 

441.21 444.25 B: let's hope for the best and um 

444.97 446.50 B: and hopefully 

446.86 448.55 B: he will find other 

448.77 450.60 B: outlets where he can 

449.84 451.35 A: mhm mhm 

450.62 457.03 B: (( enjoy himself and where he can participate as a contributing member of society )) 

454.58 463.11 A: but he yeah the worst part is he did irreparable damage to his kids that they don't want anything to do with him still 

463.16 466.11 A: but have you ever dated an alcoholic or 

463.26 464.25 B: (( well but los- but ))

471.39 472.38 B: mhm

477.25 481.36 B: no but i ah i have seen situations 

481.45 484.64 B: (( and ah as a result i um ))

492.07 493.48 A: mhm mhm 

493.13 495.75 B: 'cause like i said there's a lot of like 

495.80 501.81 B: not the initial damage that you know you also have a lot of peripheral damage

504.13 505.32 A: yeah it ah 

505.46 518.01 B: no matter how you look at it you know we are we are really only one or two degrees away from someone like that and this is not just alcohol it it's well anyone who is doing any form of suffering 

518.12 519.21 A: right 

519.91 522.87 B: (( so ah you know i i can ))

531.37 535.11 B: but ah you know it's like you said they have to take the first steps 

535.27 540.16 B: and they have to initiate that they want to be cured or want to be helped mm 

540.12 543.28 A: right right and when i um
