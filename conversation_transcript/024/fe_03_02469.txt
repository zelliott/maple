41.22 42.18 A: right 

41.70 48.08 B: i just it just bothers me that um they are so popular 'cause i think it says something about our society

49.39 50.25 B: yes 

52.69 54.56 B: and they're getting worse yes 

53.42 68.20 A: they they're just terrible um [lipsmack] i mean ah it it's funny too because a lot of the people on the shows are you know very attractive people you know seem upbeat and friendly and and you know they're they have good jobs and they're young and they're educated and i'm just not sure why they're willing to 

60.43 61.45 B: yes 

62.35 63.24 B: yes 

68.13 74.95 A: risk their you know their integrity and [laughter] and their you know their whole the risk of embarrassment on these television shows and 

70.69 71.70 B: yes 

75.02 76.85 A: it's it's pretty crazy 

76.78 78.37 B: i know and um 

77.19 78.72 A: [laughter] 

78.78 83.75 B: because one of my goals is to become a psychologist and it's like it says something about human behaviour i think 

83.30 84.70 A: i agree [laughter] 

84.00 98.21 B: you know to um and it tickles me you know because [mn] if this g- if the truth were known about that guy you know and you know what two thousand a month and a construction worker no matter how good looking he he may or may not be none of them would have given him the time of day 

93.66 94.68 A: [laughter] 

97.39 99.37 A: it's true it's true 

98.44 104.47 B: ah but you know none of them a- and we're being so i- it had nothing to do with with 

104.39 113.73 B: the fact that he might be a decent person and might that he might be a wonderful human being but that he had m- money they thought and they were being deliberately made fools of 

105.97 107.27 A: right 

113.05 114.23 A: it's true 

114.60 121.14 A: i i think the good thing about well that i i actually got kinda got into that show i was rooting for zora i think probably with the rest of america 

120.82 121.70 B: uh-huh 

121.11 133.45 A: um but i i i i thought she was a genuine person um it's the other girls that were just ah [mn] just completely you could see their hearts on their sleeves w- with you know big dollars signs written all over it 

124.65 125.74 B: yes 

132.15 134.17 B: i kn- yes 

133.55 141.86 A: um and that that guy too i don't i guess he saw it as an opportunity for exposure perhaps to become an actor or other type of media person but 

139.93 141.02 B: right 

141.92 142.91 A: (( oh yeah )) 

142.80 144.72 A: [mn] i mean but the funny thing is i 

144.51 158.25 A: not everybody that i talked to has seen one or more of them and they have you know becomes involved with them too you know watching them every week and and really getting involved i don't know it's it's kind of a phenomenon but hopefully it'll die out soon [laughter] 

148.72 149.64 B: uh-huh 

152.25 153.36 B: uh-huh 

157.60 163.78 B: well i hope you're right but i don't think so because um [noise] i mean i know people who 

164.06 165.24 B: i swear 

165.47 171.07 B: that's their whole topic of conversation when you're with them i'm sure they know the people's middle names 

167.41 168.40 A: yeah 

170.39 171.59 A: [laughter] 

171.04 181.81 B: you know the the the names of their family their cousins and i think it that um the people whom i know and my friends that watch it religiously they don't have lives 

181.15 188.57 A: yeah it can become that kind of a situation where you're so involved but i know people who watch soap operas who are like that too [laughter] 

181.88 183.24 B: they really don't 

187.69 193.91 B: ah y- y- yeah 'cause i have friends who've w- watched days of lives and for thirty years or something 

192.87 194.20 A: right [laughter] 

193.81 207.81 B: and uh those don't bother me as much because if you like i think i have a pretty interesting life for me somebody else might find it boring but i don't h- need to vicariously live my life through some v- uh t._v. personality 

200.14 201.45 A: right 

206.51 209.90 A: like these poor people who are [laughter] 

208.48 218.34 B: yeah yeah and um [sigh] like american idol that's kind of fun or you know to see a bunch of little kids who are talented that's kind of fun um 

216.21 217.71 A: right 

218.50 225.02 B: [sigh] but i think it says something about our and this other one where everybody has has a mask and 

222.75 223.61 A: (( [sigh] )) 

224.07 229.26 A: oh that one i saw that one a little bit and i oh sheesh just just it's horrible 

229.22 230.35 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

229.41 230.88 A: horrible [laughter] 

230.31 234.91 B: and like i'm not quite as bad looking as that ugly guy they show 

233.58 234.67 A: [laughter] 

234.78 241.83 B: ah but i'm a very average person you know and it's like it says something 'cause they're all young and beautiful 

236.49 237.39 A: right 

241.68 252.92 B: and it's like why do you need to come on this show in front of eighty million people and sh- yes if i were that guy yes i'd think hm i'll probably have an acting career i'll probably be in commercials like he is 

245.21 246.36 A: (( uh silly )) 

252.80 255.77 B: so yeah human nature would kick in with me too 

255.15 256.08 A: right 

255.61 268.01 B: if i looked like him if i looked yeah right yes yes i'm the first to admit it human nature is powerful so i will have acting career and you know i- we all are in charge of our own lives you know 

258.76 259.78 A: [laughter] 

261.38 262.59 A: right 

267.71 268.63 A: right 

268.21 277.92 B: and if i want someone if i want eighty million people to know that i can be as shallow and superficial and greedy and materialistic as everybody else that's my choice 

277.51 280.39 A: oh have you heard of the new one called extreme makeover 

280.03 281.23 B: no 

280.67 287.35 A: oh it's on i think channel seven i think it's a._b._c. the the people actually are selected um to 

283.58 284.51 B: okay 

287.32 301.57 A: u- undergo an extreme makeover and by extreme they mean getting plastic surgery getting perhaps breast implants or um you know getting a haircut getting make up getting new clothes but really uh you know and then going to a gym and then working out but but really getting plastic surgery 

293.11 294.31 B: (( oh yeah )) 

300.74 301.58 B: okay 

301.52 309.88 A: uh getting their teeth whitened a- and i watched that with my fiancee for maybe ten minutes or so we were just [mn] shocked that these people would do this [mn] 

303.22 304.00 B: yeah 

309.15 311.47 B: [mn] yeah yeah 

310.16 319.84 A: getting a- and both of them were married they had families and i'm thinking w- why on earth would you want to go on t._v. and do this i guess because it's free 

317.93 319.28 B: you know and 

319.62 330.00 B: and we [sigh] we do have an cul- a culture that says if you're not young if you don't have perfect teeth perfect hair no wrinkles that you're not a valuable human being i think 

320.47 321.45 A: [laughter] 

327.91 329.06 A: right 

329.28 334.06 A: i think that's that's really despicable um that that people should have to feel like that 

331.50 332.55 B: yeah 

333.82 337.27 B: but the only reason it's on is 'cause all of us watch it 

334.99 335.87 A: mhm 

336.61 339.21 A: isn't that sad [lipsmack] [laughter] 

337.74 348.75 B: and that is sad 'cause that does say something about who we are and people you know a hundred or five hundred years uh from now looking back on us w- we're going to look mighty pathetic i think unless we're even worse 

340.24 341.10 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

348.97 356.73 B: you know and i think every culture has exploited people you know and but we allow we allow it and we have ourselves to blame yeah 

354.45 357.08 A: i just wanna know what happened to you know 

357.21 367.71 A: societies where people discussed things and thought about you know intelligent i mean i couldn't even think of a topic to think of i mean really at this point because of all these crazy media things that i'm watching but 

364.51 365.82 B: yeah yeah yeah 

367.50 368.41 B: yeah 

367.75 377.03 A: you know people back in greece and and rome when they would think about these things and discuss them and and you know when kids used to i was um reading an article a- about manhattan 

376.98 391.39 A: um and things that are disappearing for example kids playing stickball in the streets because all kids now play video games so these things where people would get together and and and socialize are even gone you know for little kids they're sitting home with joysticks playing games 

380.88 382.02 B: yes 

383.22 384.36 B: yes 

388.17 389.12 B: yes 

391.28 395.81 A: so that's like part of the reality t._v. generation i guess [laughter] 

391.39 392.28 B: yeah 

395.10 400.20 B: and i think we we're we're so used to instant answers and instant gratification 

400.36 411.52 B: and you know i have a friend i go to [noise] i go to their house and if the [noise] computer is like it takes fifteen seconds they're going oh this is so slow and it's like for god's sake we're talking fifteen seconds 

408.42 410.00 A: [laughter] 

411.12 412.35 A: (( yeah [laughter] we're )) 

411.60 413.32 B: and you're calling it slow 

413.00 420.07 A: what would they have done before the wheel was invented and they had to you know pull a sled behind them or something [laughter] i- it would have been terrible [noise] 

418.20 428.10 B: [laughter] i know and it's like [sigh] and i'll go the library and it's like oh these machines are so slow for god's sake you can send an email to antarctica u- um sooner that you can blink your eyes 

427.33 428.60 A: it's true [noise] 

428.43 429.76 B: you know and [sigh] 

429.73 443.99 B: i just [noise] i know we got off topic a bit but i just think it says something about our culture that i mean i have people i in my life who are very important friends who are average maybe below average maybe aren't perfect but they're incredible human beings 

443.17 444.52 A: [noise] right sure 

444.15 451.75 B: i value them i like them uh but they're not perfect they you know maybe are overweight or uh maybe a little on the ugly side [noise] 

451.12 456.73 A: [noise] oh that doesn't that's not it d- i- outside appearances really shouldn't matter as much as inside appearances 

453.16 453.95 B: it shouldn't 

454.05 460.23 B: you're right but that's totally yeah outside and i didn't mean it to be m- bad at all just we we're running out of time 

459.40 462.44 A: i'm going to tell your friends you said that [laughter] 

461.28 469.09 B: [laughter] and yeah don't my friends i said that but you know how society would judge them as homely or ugly but they're incredible people 

462.93 464.05 A: [laughter] 

466.53 467.57 A: that's just 

468.43 472.11 A: yeah well see you didn't though you gave them a chance and that's why they're your friends 

471.70 473.74 B: yes and 

472.87 477.16 A: so why [noise] so maybe that that means that reality t._v. hasn't sunk in so deep 

477.77 481.37 A: that it's over [laughter] you know people still have hope 

479.69 480.65 B: (( [sigh] well )) 

481.16 485.74 B: and again if eighty million people didn't watch them they wouldn't be on the air 

485.00 486.09 A: (( that's true )) 

486.04 493.27 B: and i do think it's sad for the people whom i know that do not have lives and are bored maybe it's good that they have this outlet 

493.27 505.86 B: because it they they have to have something to talk about to think about you know and they do have you know uh social intercourse with each other because they talk about american idol they talk about joe millionaire and it's like but you talk about these t._v. 

505.82 512.19 B: personalities and you don't talk about your own life what are you doing you know what books have you read what thoughts do you have 

509.84 511.31 A: right 

511.58 512.57 A: right 

512.61 514.11 B: and it's these the 

513.28 520.12 A: well we can start the movement now tell all your friends don't watch these shows and read books and discuss them and [laughter] 

516.67 518.24 B: (( [laughter] well )) 

518.72 519.54 B: well 

519.44 531.47 B: you know to make a very very long story short 'cause i k now we're running out of time you know i go i go to the local starbucks where there are university students there are people who want to be lawyers and there are people who are studying and thinking and talking when joe millionaire is on 

531.26 545.64 B: and they they they're in front of their laptops writing their dissertations and their you know thesis in- instead of glued to the to not watching the simpsons and not watching joe so i think there are a lotta people like you and i 

536.26 537.47 A: good [laughter] 

545.61 548.44 B: that that know there are there's more to life 

547.88 561.98 A: well hopefully you know if pe- people just look at it for a little bit of entertainment and and and don't get so involved into it that's okay but when it becomes s- such a phenomenon that it just takes over that's when it it's really just out of control and some something needs to be done 

548.78 549.83 B: yeah 

551.99 552.83 B: yeah 

561.79 563.09 A: [laughter] 

562.44 568.96 B: well i have friends you know you're talking on the phone much as we are and it's like oh no um american idol's on i gotta go bye see ya 

568.61 578.17 A: and then it's y- y- your friends are actually important who are people are are being taken over for you know some television show which isn't that a sad state of affairs [laughter] [laughter] 

571.78 572.64 B: yes 

577.57 579.48 B: yes and again you know 

579.63 590.92 B: like [sigh] i don't know if you saw the last time of course i could tell you that the the f- the fat guy was going to get booted out and the the good looking cowboy singer was gonna is gonna stay in i mean this is just [mn] the facts of life 

588.10 589.14 A: [laughter] 

590.93 599.89 B: you know i i i read a book a long time ago the power of beauty you know and beauty is very i- very powerful and [sigh] but i i 

593.86 595.69 A: oh yeah
