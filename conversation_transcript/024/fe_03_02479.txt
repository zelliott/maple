275.37 287.95 A: [lipsmack] i watched a few of those shows and she reminds me of some of these good old girls that i've met in in texas you know that if if her i._q. was any lower you'd have to water 'em twice a week

298.25 303.74 A: you know and i've watched it a couple of times but it moves so slowly i get out of patience and go onto something else 

304.18 305.57 B: (( [laughter] )) 

305.23 312.94 A: but what's scary you know i when i've seen bits and pieces of that i think my god there are people who really watch that it 

312.38 313.11 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

312.97 316.38 A: makes me wonder about them [laughter] 

316.15 322.68 B: i guess they don't get enough d- you know during the day all these there's all these reality these talk shows you know 

323.09 330.26 B: i guess they figured there wasn't enough of that on t._v. now they're making it's like almost all t._v. is becoming reality t._v. 

329.79 331.95 A: but why do you think it's so popular 

331.61 333.68 B: (( i yeah [sigh] )) 

335.28 337.73 B: god i i don't know i mean 

339.20 340.51 B: (( [laughter] i don't know )) 

339.45 341.95 A: [noise] well voyeurism comes to mind 

340.86 343.00 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

342.29 354.16 A: but you know i i don't want to be anybody but me i i'm a pow wow dancer and i've my hair has gotten white now in places and what's not white or graying is blond [mn] [lipsmack] 

345.00 346.23 B: (( [laughter] exactly )) 

353.45 354.39 B: mhm 

354.45 363.21 A: um i'm fair complected in the winter time in the summer time i get real brown real easy but when i go to pow wows i have two two long braids 

363.14 371.56 A: so only the white parts show after the braid ties are on and i look like somebody's indian grandmother ghost or ghost grandmother 

369.74 370.87 B: mhm 

371.68 373.25 A: and 

373.74 381.08 A: i pointed out one time to a little gal that made a snippy remark di- digressing from reality t._v. this is my real life but 

381.26 390.83 A: uh she didn't like these white folks coming in you know one of these well it was a contest pow wow and i beat out all of the other grandmothers in my division except one 

391.15 396.16 A: and i pointed out well i'm not a wannabe you know i really am part chachow 

396.44 397.03 B: (( [laughter] )) 

396.96 404.39 A: and i don't want to be anything but what i am and i'd rather watch my own life than watch somebody else's life 'cause mine's a whole lot more interesting [laughter] 

403.30 406.83 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

405.05 409.03 A: e- except for survivor i i think it's real intriguing 

409.83 420.44 B: yeah i think the first one got a lot of buzz you know it's kinda like when uh was it that who wants to be a millionaire when that came out it was you know real popular people were glued to that 

412.20 413.55 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

420.65 421.31 B: was 

421.79 423.95 B: it seemed like it was on a lot more 

424.15 427.60 B: now now i don't i don't really talk to anybody who watches it 

427.55 432.83 A: well i wouldn't be interested in that unless i was one of the contestants and then i'd be real interested 

430.38 431.48 B: yeah 

432.28 433.73 B: yeah 

433.02 441.07 A: and real competitive i wonder what the audience profile is for reality shows if it's more women than men have you ever heard 

441.67 443.04 B: uh 

444.46 445.68 B: you know i don't know 

446.22 448.63 B: (( i don't know that's a good question )) 

447.11 453.92 A: well the reason that the reason that came to mind i was thinking i'd rather watch paint dry that watch reality t._v. 

452.94 455.25 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

454.80 459.14 A: yeah 'cause my life is really interesting at at least it keeps me going [laughter] 

457.08 457.88 B: [laughter] 

459.27 467.87 A: but i've i've seen men that would just get absorbed in sports and i would think why wouldn't you rather be out playing sports you know 

467.38 468.53 B: yeah 

467.88 470.36 A: why watch somebody doing something 

469.14 472.24 B: it's like decompre- i think it's like decompression time 

471.75 472.77 A: you reckon 

472.56 486.36 B: pr- at least the sports is you know it's like their cave they go into their cave and they just forget about what they did all day long and you get kind of absorbed in someone else's life and people like to have people trophies 

487.11 489.32 A: hm well that's a thought 

487.33 490.16 B: you know so they can just see their the people 

491.02 494.76 B: they idolize on on t._v. whatever playing sports mm 

494.73 500.41 A: well that's something else i don't do i've never been able to find any idols that didn't have clay feet 

500.88 504.86 A: [sigh] i but when you talk about decompression [mn] 

505.35 509.78 A: first of all my life is not real real stressful 'cause i i can do pretty well what i want to 

510.45 518.25 A: but i do a a an oriental exercise every day called shagong and that just makes stress non existent in your life i mean it just 

514.60 515.75 B: mhm 

517.32 518.90 B: i have heard of that 

518.48 522.46 A: it is wonderful stuff if you ever have a chance to learn it or take it up 

521.76 522.80 B: mhm 

522.67 523.69 A: (( um )) 

523.84 529.86 A: i think everybody ought to do shagong and then they wouldn't have any stress and they wouldn't need to decompress [laughter] 

529.52 534.49 B: [laughter] [sigh] i think i'll pay more attention to that 'cause i know i have a file at home on it 

535.10 540.37 B: and i i remember reading up on it and it did seem very interesting i i'm certainly 

538.38 539.24 A: yeah 

540.53 543.46 B: much more open i think than the average person to 

543.50 546.22 B: all these different modalities and therapies 

546.46 555.84 A: [lipsmack] well i got a book and i can't recall the author's name right off 'cause i got it several years the eight eas- easy movements or the eight pieces of bro- brocade 

555.88 558.50 A: and it's uh called shagong for beginners 

558.94 569.53 A: and [sigh] it has a lot of pictures in it and you can look at them you know and take it shows you how to take each move until you get it memorized and and then do 'em 

569.94 573.77 A: but there's an awful lot of information out there on on shagong [noise] and 

574.95 576.81 B: so so you do ten minutes of that a day 

577.05 588.90 A: well the guy that wrote this book says you can do it in ten minutes a day i usually go slower and do it do more of each move for like twenty minutes and i do a ten minute warm up before 

580.96 581.86 B: mhm 

589.63 593.83 A: he's a phd and i don't have his book handy i just got the shagong catalogue 

594.18 599.89 A: handy and our time's going to be up and the computer will say that our time is also up and we've gotten 

598.74 599.95 B: (( [laughter] this is ))
