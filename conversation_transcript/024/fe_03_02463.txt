17.37 19.03 A: yes do you watch any 

19.09 20.24 B: um 

20.75 27.60 B: well you know i'm fifty three and the about the only thing that interests me anymore is the bachelor show that shows the pretty girls 

27.43 31.83 A: [laughter] well i don't watch any reality shows although i've seen a couple 

31.95 33.19 B: mhm 

32.23 32.90 A: i 

33.15 34.00 A: i just 

34.26 36.91 A: to me they're no they're almost no different than like um 

36.93 40.44 A: talk shows that you know you're just airing your personal business in front of everyone 

40.62 42.54 B: yeah i guess its it's 

40.81 41.87 A: and 

42.47 55.03 B: i can't imagine how they get these people to do things [laughter] i do have i have to admit i watch that fear factor show every once in a while because when i watch them eating the bugs and things it takes me back about 

54.48 55.47 A: [laughter] 

54.95 61.73 B: forty-five years ago when i was a little kid and we used to do that stuff for fun nobody paid us to do that 

61.19 67.30 A: well i just think that when i see people doing those things i think that to do those things they must really want attention 

67.09 68.59 B: [laughter] 

67.76 75.30 A: so you know that if you're going to go air your business on you know national t._v. like that you really want to be in the public eye 

75.24 77.41 B: yep i i agree with you 

76.13 77.33 A: [laughter] 

77.80 79.37 B: (( where are you located )) 

78.06 78.94 A: (( but um ))

98.45 99.22 A: (( [mn] )) 

105.02 106.80 A: oh okay 

107.31 115.09 A: but uh i guess we're supposed to talk for like the whole eight minutes about this reality show stuff like either one of us know much about cause we don't watch it [laughter] 

113.33 115.81 B: yeah you're right 

115.40 123.78 A: but um you know what i mean i've seen it a couple of times i guess i can understand why some people like when people have fun watching it because it's you can relate to it cause it's real life 

123.67 125.20 B: yeah 

124.56 125.60 A: but um 

125.33 140.27 B: but but to to bare yourself you know besides you know some of these shows they bare almost everything on their body but besides that you know to be kissing and hugging and you know passionate embraces and it just seems like 

131.96 133.08 A: oh yeah 

139.63 147.05 A: well i also think i just happened to watch part of a show on the other day it was visiting someone in a hospital during a date and she happened to have on blind date 

146.49 148.35 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

147.22 150.15 A: and i just i could not believe it because i mean 

150.87 156.41 A: on the first date first of all they're talking about you know sex and you know whether or not 

156.48 160.90 A: you know how much they like sex or have sex [laughter] and then talking about you know 

161.01 161.84 A: um 

162.22 164.69 A: she starts talking about her breast size 

164.48 165.92 B: oh my goodness 

165.04 168.52 A: (( and like all of this stuff on national t._v. you know on their first date )) 

167.37 170.64 B: oh i'm gonna have to watch this show when is it on 

169.98 176.82 A: [laughter] i don't even know but i was thinking is if this girl's mother is watching this show she's going to have a heart attack 

176.78 178.30 B: yeah yeah 

177.79 187.81 A: like i just find it so stupid that the people come across like such bimbos like i mean and she actually said to the guy he said something like well you know i like a really classy woman and she said oh well i have had a lot of people telling 

188.16 191.77 A: me i am the classiest you will never find a classier woman than me 

191.16 193.36 B: oh yeah sounds like it 

192.05 194.63 A: talking about her breast size 

194.09 197.73 B: [laughter] maybe that's low class she's referring to 

197.14 201.83 A: well exactly [laughter] so to me it's just more like um it 

202.41 204.62 A: is more entertainment to laugh at 

204.23 205.26 B: yeah 

204.63 208.92 A: but i couldn't imagine really the people who really do it because they're getting laughed at [laughter] 

207.86 222.59 B: well how would you like you mentioned how would you like it to be the parents seeing your daughter on there how about these shows they make on spring break with all of the kids carrying on you know the thing i regret is that i never had the money to go to one of those when i was 

212.49 213.57 A: oh i know 

216.27 217.64 A: oh my god 

221.54 223.27 A: [laughter] 

222.65 224.32 B: nineteen years old 

223.70 225.67 A: yeah i never went to those either 

225.18 226.66 B: yeah 

226.11 230.65 A: i mean i went to i went to uh you know the jersey shore 

230.75 233.08 A: like after graduation kind of thing but 

232.95 240.98 B: how is that is it i i've been up and down the east coast but i haven't made it that far north is it pretty decent 

234.87 236.56 A: (( you wouldn't like it )) 

240.86 249.38 A: the jersey shore well when i went and that was years ago and it was kind of i mean it was alright but i mean i just remember everybody getting really drunk and trashing the hotel rooms 

249.39 250.36 B: yeah 

249.78 251.82 A: and you know thinking like you know 

252.21 254.15 A: now when i look back on it [laughter] 

253.79 258.43 B: well i i was wondering how the how the actual beach and the water if it's 

257.89 260.97 A: you know i haven't been there in years that was in eighty five 

260.34 262.58 B: oh okay well 

262.36 265.95 A: although i have friends who have houses in the jersey shore so they stay it's nice 

265.66 270.80 B: that's good but um let's see what other reality shows are there 

270.87 271.79 A: um 

272.44 276.83 A: good question cause i don't watch a whole lot of them um what else have i seen um 

274.29 275.69 B: [laughter] 

277.48 280.31 A: i don't even think i've seen how to how to 

280.94 284.44 A: um how to marry a millionaire or whatever i mean i've never watched it once 

283.98 285.46 B: yeah 

285.12 286.03 A: um 

286.59 293.93 A: but um the sad thing is shows like you know they need to be single to be married some without even having met them you are just supposed to go marry the person 

294.07 296.85 B: well but you know but but then again the way 

296.88 307.26 B: a lot of people are certainly not everybody there is a lot of people who don't think twice about you know just moving on to someone else just get a divorce and just keep on talking 

305.34 306.22 A: well 

307.22 308.44 A: that's true 

308.05 309.18 B: yeah 

309.07 310.04 A: but uh 

310.45 319.39 A: i don't know i couldn't do it just like i can't really see these people who would do these things it's funny to watch them sometimes but i just can't imagine doing what they're doing or getting on a show like that 

318.70 323.53 B: yeah well they have that the one out now where the young lady is trying to pick a 

323.62 328.10 B: husband from a group of twenty guys that are wearing masks 

327.89 329.64 A: oh right right right 

329.18 333.39 B: i just i can't imagine anything more demeaning than than 

333.86 343.26 B: trying to sell yourself like that and then hiding your face it just seems it seems so unnatural i don't i don't think i would be a very good participant yeah 

342.68 347.38 A: and but if you notice all of these shows all of the people happen to be on tend to be pretty good looking people 

346.94 349.32 B: yeah that's true yeah 

347.63 350.19 A: (( you know i mean to me i think they are the only )) 

349.37 351.89 B: that guys like me on there 

351.40 360.94 A: [laughter] but you know i think there is like especially with women i don't think they'd have the confidence to go on t._v. like that if they didn't really think they were attractive enough to have people like them maybe to embarrassed to do it 

360.52 363.05 B: well i think you are probably right 

362.87 371.18 A: although you have to wonder if he winning or you know so attractive and all what's wrong with them because they are that desperate that they are going on t._v. to meet somebody or they need that much attention 

367.19 368.64 B: [laughter] 

371.11 375.44 B: well i think it's a money service is what it is you know 

374.99 376.15 A: (( yeah )) 

375.50 379.58 B: to get a lot of cash and a lot of exposure and so on 

379.07 380.00 A: (( uh-huh )) 

380.25 387.90 B: but we what the heck oh oh so they have those entertainment shows so what you know star search and things like that 

387.51 391.17 A: yeah but i don't know i don't think those are considered reality shows are they 

390.98 392.46 B: you know i don't know 

391.67 395.19 A: i mean not they're not like living your life on t._v. so to speak 

394.77 396.20 B: yeah that's true 

395.68 397.79 A: i mean those are fun i like those shows 

397.73 404.52 B: but i i guess to be an american idol or to be a star you have to know how to sing and dance 

404.33 405.47 A: yeah 

404.89 414.26 B: to to play the piano or to play the violin or something like that yeah but but you never see any of those talents all you see is singing 

407.64 409.82 A: yeah you definitely need to have a talent 

414.54 416.53 A: well no american idol 

416.80 423.18 A: is specifically for singing that is specifically to find a singer i mean they have singing all different musical categories though 

418.36 419.62 B: oh 

422.85 424.43 B: mhm 

423.87 426.32 A: each week there is like a different category 

426.99 429.81 A: but see my husband he is in music management
