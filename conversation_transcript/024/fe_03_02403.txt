9.73 12.33 A: so we're talking about all these bad habits tonight huh

14.89 20.95 A: [laughter] as have i yes as a matter of fact i'm still smoking that's the bad thing but ah yeah 

19.22 20.34 B: oh really 

20.85 25.09 B: yeah that's that's the thing that's on everybody's ah agenda right now 

24.64 30.29 A: mhm ah drinking ah drinking's a big thing with me because um 

25.59 26.47 B: (( but ah )) 

30.30 33.63 A: i came um my father's an alcoholic and um 

32.02 32.86 B: uh-huh 

33.99 36.79 A: he's been sober for twenty seven years now 

36.56 37.52 B: oh wow 

36.98 38.30 A: yeah god bless him 

38.39 44.52 A: and ah he's doing well and ah i do remember as a child though a couple of episodes that he had and stuff like that 

43.99 46.14 B: so like did that keep you away or 

45.57 46.52 A: um 

46.74 51.60 A: ah yeah i would think so yeah during my teenage years i mean i guess i was just a teenager but ah 

50.99 51.98 B: right 

52.01 55.16 A: now you know i've got my own family and everything so um 

55.58 57.07 A: yeah it's not ah 

57.67 59.63 A: and ah especially 

58.69 60.65 B: do you not drink a drop or do you just 

60.30 66.75 A: oh no no no i drink socially and stuff like that but um nothing i don't need to have one when i come home or anything like that 

61.83 62.57 B: yeah 

65.58 66.40 B: right 

66.88 71.16 A: um and i'm thankful for that because i know it can be ah genetic sometimes 

69.70 70.52 B: sure 

71.43 73.58 B: yeah and it can run in families too 

72.91 76.90 A: yeah it actually did actually on both sides my mother's and my father's side 

76.13 76.93 B: uh-huh 

77.57 82.45 A: and ah i'm a i'm not a big fan of ah d._w._i. either so [laughter] 

82.13 83.71 B: no yeah 

83.61 90.22 A: ah i've seen what it can do um my occupation ah i deal with it one on one basically so um 

91.16 94.30 A: it's ah it's not a good thing i've seen the results of it so 

94.04 95.33 B: yeah 

94.62 95.95 A: i think that's ah 

96.04 98.74 A: one of my biggest fears ah as a result of it 

99.49 100.40 A: (( you know )) 

100.41 107.40 A: my wife and my child in the car will get hit by somebody who's been drinking or something like that it's just the idea blows my mind it really does 

104.63 105.95 B: it is it's scary 

108.25 111.55 B: yeah and ah i mean and and people it it's 

111.69 115.22 B: m- much more widespread i think than people even realize 

115.03 117.53 A: it's far more widespread absolutely 

116.02 117.01 B: yeah 

117.24 129.86 B: i mean i mean in the city you got kind of not as much probably but ah if you go out into a rural or suburban area i mean there's r- i mean people don't use cabs people don't use public transportation so 

128.94 131.55 A: exactly everybody relies on their own transportation 

130.42 131.30 B: yeah 

131.97 136.30 B: and nobody designates a driver i mean some people do but it's a very small percentage 

135.95 140.41 A: well take a typical bar i mean how many how many people are leaving how many patrons leaving the bar 

140.70 142.46 A: perfectly legal to drive 

141.97 144.35 B: yeah oh a very small percentage 

143.82 144.74 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

144.36 145.94 B: and i mean 

145.70 147.28 A: maybe the bartender 

147.22 149.11 B: yeah exactly 

147.51 148.72 A: possibly 

148.82 151.10 A: but then that's about it as far as i'm concerned 

150.52 158.68 B: yeah i mean again it's the legal limits have come down so far where i mean you can't have two drinks and drive i mean officially legally 

155.60 156.38 A: (( no )) 

156.87 161.40 A: and if you think about it if you if you go out right and you have two drinks let's say 

161.76 165.26 A: and you're fine to drive you really are but somebody hits you 

165.40 169.76 A: just taps you in the rear and you need a police report y- you're in a lot of trouble 

165.42 166.23 B: (( oh yeah )) 

166.59 167.33 B: yeah 

168.96 170.41 B: yeah yeah 

169.79 180.31 A: and ah financially it's it's ridiculous what it's gonna do to you if it was a car your insurance goes up it's crazy you know to th- it's a pretty pretty silly crime if you ask me 

173.00 173.86 B: yeah 

180.47 185.20 A: caffeine not a big deal with me i'm like ah one cup in the morning and then i'm done 

184.84 189.12 B: yeah i i actually stay away even more than that i i mostly drink decaf 

188.77 189.89 A: mhm 

189.30 190.73 B: ah i've been 

190.83 204.41 B: i've been i kind of think it messes with your cycles a little bit you know yeah if you get if you get too involved with it but i'll have a caffeine every once in a while no big deal i just try not to be like every day you know gotta have my caffeine in the morning because 

194.50 195.69 A: it could sure 

204.35 208.15 A: i got to admit i like my coffee in the morning but just one that's all i need 

206.43 209.10 B: yeah yeah a lot of people like that 

209.07 211.45 A: and then ah during the day even ah 

211.48 222.20 A: i drink ah generally i'll drink soda that doesn't have caffeine in it ah your diet sprite diet seven up that type of thing and i don't like ah regular colas hm once in a while but 

222.59 226.20 A: i- i- it really doesn't affect me it won't keep me up at night 

225.67 226.46 B: (( oh )) 

226.21 227.73 A: (( but ah i )) 

227.86 229.48 A: just prefer not to have it 

229.02 231.91 B: yeah it's just one more thing in your system that you don't really need 

231.42 232.73 A: absolutely 

232.12 235.37 B: it's not not not a serious thing i don't think 

235.21 237.25 A: no what what else did they mention 

238.83 241.47 B: ah what is the worst out of all these things 

240.85 242.15 A: the worst one 

243.31 249.09 A: [sigh] i don't know it it's ah it's between the alcohol and smoking i guess it's gotta be 

247.47 250.15 B: yeah probably for your health 

250.15 252.97 A: yeah for health purposes especially i would say 

253.51 257.97 A: to the public the alcohol is more dangerous to the individual the smoking's more dangerous 

257.51 259.87 B: right right 

259.27 260.04 A: (( and ah )) 

259.97 264.57 B: over eating though is a huge problem in america i mean there's a lot of obese people out there 

262.62 263.52 A: yeah 

264.01 267.31 A: yeah look at all the over weight people too that's another consideration 

267.53 269.84 A: luckily i'm still a size thirty four 

269.33 274.68 B: [laughter] yeah i mean i just keep it under control i've just started exercising which is um 

275.38 281.25 B: i i hadn't exercised for years really and i just started kind of getting in the program so it it's good 

280.56 284.16 A: that yeah that's a good routine for you i gotta do the same thing um 

284.55 289.43 A: um the ba- our baby's ah eleven weeks old so it's been a little crazy [laughter] 

288.21 289.61 B: oh i'm sure yeah 

289.35 300.56 A: but ah yeah we gotta ah my wife ah belongs to the gym and she she hasn't been back since but um she's itching to go back and stuff like that so when we get a little more routine 

299.13 300.07 B: that's good 

300.76 302.40 B: that's dedication 

301.83 304.00 A: yeah yeah absolutely 

304.25 307.85 A: but i think ah if you make a part of your routine then y- then you 

308.71 319.13 A: i i guess you're conditioned to either need it or like it ah i know some people enjoy it i know some people don't and and people will ah in both cases they'll do it regularly anyway 

311.30 312.41 B: yeah 

318.69 319.84 B: right 

320.19 322.93 A: and ah i do definitely have to get back into that 

323.31 331.57 A: although i work out you know with weights once in a while at the gym just to i have to [laughter] that's ah i gotta be prepared but ah 

328.09 329.28 B: right 

332.66 334.67 A: yeah exercise definitely important 

334.84 341.40 A: but my my feeling would be ah i can't decide which is worse but ah definitely the smoking and the drinking would be the number one and two 

341.15 342.75 B: yeah 

341.92 344.13 A: and everything would follow in suit from there 

343.97 346.73 B: what do you think about the smoking ban in new york now 

346.42 348.84 A: ah oh with the restaurants and everything 

347.75 348.68 B: (( you know what i like )) 

349.00 349.91 B: (( it you do )) 

349.67 356.05 A: yeah see even with with my baby and everything i i we don't smoke in the house at all or the car 

355.45 356.26 B: right 

356.06 360.76 A: or nowhere around him um change our clothes and wash our hands before he's handled 

361.07 364.52 A: so um and we've 

364.70 367.64 A: we've nar- we used to smoke in the house but that was years ago 

367.24 368.29 B: yeah 

367.71 371.28 A: and we don't do it anymore i i've quit a few times 

371.45 376.22 A: ah one time for a year and a half and a couple of you know eight months here six months there 

376.34 379.92 A: so i i'm i think i'm reaching my point where eventually you 

380.21 385.53 A: know just it'll i'll hit the point where okay now i'm definitely stopping and i'm hoping so anyway 

380.24 381.07 B: sure 

383.89 384.82 B: yeah 

385.27 392.12 B: well it would be nice to be able to bring the ah kid to the to a restaurant and not worry about somebody at the next table smoking 

390.33 391.15 A: yes 

391.26 394.42 A: i i do enjoy that i really and um 

394.56 398.76 A: even as smoker i could say we we don't like sitting in the smoking section 

398.14 399.30 B: yeah 

398.97 403.04 A: um and i i think it's a little tough in the bar situation 

403.33 406.38 A: ah i know they go hand in hand for a lot of people 

405.76 406.67 B: (( i know )) 

406.86 417.73 A: and i can understand the business owners going a little crazy over it but i've got to be honest with you we went out we went out to friday's last weekend and they still had a smoking section so i don't know how they yeah i don't know how they're getting around this 

415.03 416.39 B: did they really 

417.96 418.73 B: (( oh )) 

418.38 425.34 A: and it wasn't wasn't like enclosed in glass or anything like that it was just higher than the rest of the restaurant was 

425.08 429.55 B: i don't know if they've started fining yet or maybe they'll wait another few months or something 

429.40 431.83 A: you would think a chain like that would definitely 

430.90 434.42 B: yeah yeah a chain you would think would definitely be right 

433.49 436.78 A: you know go according to the rules no questions asked 

437.77 438.54 A: (( but ah )) 

438.74 444.91 A: it's been a tough i know the smokers have rights too but you know what the the rights of those who don't smoke i think over ride that 

444.34 453.20 B: yeah i mean my girlfriend just ah just gave up smoking and she it's been so much easier for her to be able to go out and not have to see everybody smoking 

452.60 456.58 A: yes that's definitely going to help her absolutely i know what she's going through 

456.72 457.68 B: so 

457.63 459.60 A: good for her though good luck to her as well 

458.86 461.37 B: yeah i think in the long run it 

461.70 467.85 B: it's you know it it'll hurt the business in the bars at first but in the long run a lot of people are going to quit smoking 

467.27 472.75 A: yeah um there's a few restaurants that we've been to around here as well where where everybody's just smoking outside 

472.19 473.30 B: right 

473.28 477.48 A: and ah you know that's it but yeah i was very surprised by that 

477.55 481.97 A: you know last week at fridays it blew my actually it blew my mind 

480.69 482.66 B: (( yeah it would )) 

482.96 486.04 A: but we had a couple of hours away from him so we were thrilled 

485.63 486.70 B: [laughter] 

486.82 489.82 A: (( and ah yeah drinking is ah )) 

489.85 491.68 A: drinking is number one i think 

492.16 495.22 A: the dangers it poses to everybody else and 

494.25 496.21 B: yeah excess obviously 

495.82 497.29 A: yeah 

496.75 500.53 B: i mean social drinking yeah and and well the driving too is but 

499.99 504.24 A: oh the driving yeah but even even what it does ah just to the family structure 

503.85 505.60 B: yeah 

504.74 506.02 A: um 

506.83 509.93 A: a couple of uncles i've had have died due to drinking 

510.13 512.83 A: ah my grandfather as well on both sides 

512.79 513.65 B: oh wow 

513.79 515.04 A: so um 

515.39 524.38 A: and it's tough to go through it's tough it's tough to see what effect it had on my mother i you know i had to i still have memories of that and ah but ah 

524.59 531.94 A: she's a strong woman and luckily my father was as well and they managed to pull through it and 

532.02 534.56 A: and they're both better people as a result of it 

533.79 535.40 B: yeah 

535.67 547.04 B: yeah i'd have to say due to my family history smoking would be the worst 'cause the heart disease on both sides of the family and then my grandmother had lung cancer so she smoked until 

542.64 543.90 A: is that right 

545.14 545.88 A: (( oh )) 

547.43 548.97 A: how old was she 

548.81 550.32 B: she was about 

551.16 553.97 B: early about early eighties 

553.33 554.86 A: mhm 

554.45 559.04 B: an- but she smoked up until like a year to two years before she died 

559.03 563.80 A: yeah and then once once they stop it's like the body goes through a change too 

563.04 568.32 B: oh i know when you've been smoking for sixty years i mean [laughter] your body needs it 

565.05 566.05 A: yes 

566.29 571.06 A: it's tough yeah exactly it does it does build up a dependency that's for sure 

571.48 575.81 A: ah luckily ah not that it's a better thing but i don't smoke that much 

576.27 579.46 A: maybe a not even a half a pack a day at this point 

578.90 582.72 B: right yeah th- i mean that really helps ev- every every little bit helps you know 

582.33 583.56 A: yeah i suppose 

583.85 587.63 A: and ah i smoke ultra lights you know like they're safer now 

587.75 588.68 B: right 

588.07 589.47 A: silly silly 

588.95 590.54 B: yeah [laughter] 

589.86 591.20 A: really is 

590.58 596.38 B: yeah that's my girlfriend did that for the last like year she's like well i went down to the ultra lights 

595.66 599.89 A: yeah interestingly enough they put little holes in the filter they call it ultra lights but they're exactly the
