209.25 210.24 A: i guess 

210.52 211.78 A: people watch -em because 

212.53 216.33 A: of the dram- well i think i watched real world just because of the drama

227.79 229.20 A: when i was that age 

229.07 230.67 B: uh-huh yeah 

229.40 230.19 A: you know and 

230.82 231.33 B: yeah 

231.00 232.78 A: m._t._v. was kind of a 

233.31 234.69 A: relatively new 

234.66 235.07 B: mhm 

235.53 236.78 A: and um 

242.03 243.14 B: yeah i think so 

244.92 245.37 B: yeah 

245.74 248.77 A: that would've been around the time that i would've been a teenager 

249.59 250.16 B: yeah 

250.39 251.81 A: i'm sure my brother might've 

251.92 254.51 A: liked to have participated in those things too but 

254.69 255.06 B: ah 

255.54 258.85 A: i don't think that i ever would have tried to participate in a 

259.29 262.46 A: uh one of those television shows i think though that 

263.01 265.47 A: uh i would've like to have known that i could have 

266.19 266.65 B: yeah 

267.32 269.52 B: they actually had tried to get one of my friends and i 

269.62 274.97 B: in on one of these shows the um i don't know if you've heard of it it's called um extreme dating 

276.47 277.53 A: no hm hm 

276.64 277.54 B: have you heard of that one 

277.66 279.88 A: huh-uh huh-uh what's that one about 

278.46 278.93 B: i think it's 

279.65 281.61 B: it's about where um 

282.79 285.60 B: you and another person um 

285.69 288.03 B: are sitting in a um in a room 

288.21 292.01 B: and you guys are hooked up to like a phone or something and um your ex- 

292.29 293.34 B: uh boyfriend 

293.53 296.18 B: goes out on um a date with a girl 

296.44 297.23 B: and um 

296.63 297.17 A: mhm 

297.48 301.81 B: you're telling the girl things into her phone or something oh like this 

300.61 302.45 A: oh yeah 

301.97 306.80 B: ask him about this ask him about this or to try to discourage her from um 

305.83 306.34 A: mhm 

307.06 307.97 B: going out with him 

308.28 311.97 B: and then i guess like if he ends up going out with her then he wins 

312.11 316.69 B: a certain amount of money but if um she ends up not going out with him then um 

316.82 318.47 B: the ex-girlfriends win the money 

319.46 320.20 A: oh 

319.96 320.96 B: so yeah 

320.29 321.52 A: so why i mean 

321.78 322.06 A: what's 

322.19 326.95 A: it was- it wasn't that you had to have a a friend on there you were just trying to go on there with your friend 

327.15 333.04 B: yeah they they just they had tried to get my friend and i had tried to go on there but i i just she wanted to do it because she's

354.81 355.81 B: like reality show 

356.49 359.56 A: do you think it's just a phase or you think it'll blow over or 

359.85 365.00 B: who who knows i mean as long as it's getting like ratings and people are watching the stuff i think it's going to 

365.64 366.80 B: you keep on going

473.71 474.72 B: yeah yeah 

475.16 475.65 B: yeah 

477.09 478.21 A: yeah i i 

478.46 482.65 A: i initially i didn't c- i didn't follow it from the very very beginning 

482.95 483.32 B: uh-huh 

483.40 484.85 A: (( just )) and i would always 

485.38 487.60 A: get to see one night but miss another night 

487.94 489.31 B: yeah yeah 

490.37 494.61 A: and it's only recently as the numbers have narrowed down and the contestants that i've 

494.97 498.08 A: actually remembering oh yeah this comes on you know 

497.58 497.99 B: mhm 

498.21 499.22 A: eight o'clock my time 

500.07 501.45 A: (( on today i think )) 

501.79 502.25 B: hm 

505.45 506.03 B: yeah 

509.38 511.56 A: nice i think that's uh i mean i i i 

511.64 516.35 A: i like the concept of that one even if they are a little cruel from time to time 

513.86 514.40 B: yeah 

516.72 517.38 B: yeah 

518.14 518.97 A: but ruben 

519.25 523.48 A: is definitely great because you know he's such an exception to probably what 

524.65 526.57 A: they were looking for in terms of an idol 

525.56 526.82 B: exactly yeah 

527.60 528.14 B: yeah 

528.27 530.26 B: i agre- i actually had wanted to 

530.60 532.76 B: um audition for that show myself 

532.52 534.14 A: oh really do you sing 

533.86 535.94 B: i sing yeah but it 

542.55 544.77 B: but you know what i was glad to see this year 

544.97 548.33 B: they weren't seeming to be like that and that's what i really like the most 

548.95 550.53 A: i think they realize that the 

550.63 553.78 A: stereotypical person was not necessarily the best person 

553.38 553.92 B: yeah 

554.58 558.35 A: cause i was surprised that they didn't like uh what was her name kim 

558.84 559.66 B: k- yeah 

560.10 562.15 A: um you know i thought she was talented 

560.89 562.83 B: i really liked her she was very good 

563.22 564.35 A: but they just 

564.47 565.56 A: for some reason 

565.90 567.62 A: and it could've been from 

565.95 566.38 B: yeah 

567.73 569.95 A: you know the beginning when she was such
