58.37 60.96 A: [mn] um i i 

61.19 72.33 A: i mean i think they're slightly entertaining i don't think i had anything else to watch on t._v. that i liked that night but i'm not i'm i'm not really into them at all 

64.38 65.37 B: well 

68.08 69.24 B: yeah 

71.73 86.09 B: well actually you know i'm not either um you know and i almost want to even and i know i've heard about that you know um survivor and those shows i think i saw it maybe once [sigh] and i don't know it just didn't make any reality check with me 

86.02 90.93 A: have you seen the ads of the one that m- mr personality 

91.00 95.59 B: you know i did but i haven't watched it is that the one with monica lewinsky 

95.51 99.66 A: yes i ha i haven't watched it either but the uh like the um 

99.76 106.56 A: [lipsmack] the ads on t._v. where they show the guy is very upset and he can't take it any more and he's going to take his mask off 

106.00 108.36 B: [mn] right right i think i saw that too 

106.73 114.43 A: [laughter] i mean my fourteen year old is someone that tells me that these shows are like very very silly 

114.04 119.85 B: [noise] yeah yeah you know i have to probably agree with her for you know the little that i've seen of 'em 

119.97 122.78 B: and it doesn't excite me at all 

123.43 124.99 A: i know i know 

124.03 130.54 B: you know i mean you know you almost wonder if it is really a reality thing or or something else you know 

130.65 136.40 B: but i suppose it is but um and even the one is r- remember the one that was on 

136.49 138.00 B: where um 

138.11 145.43 B: he picked the bride their they got married or something her name was darma or darva or one of those did you see it remember that one 

143.30 146.73 A: oh that that was the first one 

146.13 148.12 B: was that the first you know 

147.12 155.42 A: the very very the yes the w- that they went on a cr- no well i saw parts of that one actually 

149.17 150.29 B: did you see that 

152.22 152.98 B: [laughter] 

154.10 155.95 B: yeah yeah i did too 

155.60 159.26 A: where you where yes i did watch um 

159.54 166.06 A: a couple of episodes of that one where you had the women dressed actually in their wedding gowns 

164.13 166.97 B: in their wedding go- ah yes yes 

166.28 167.44 A: yes 

167.08 168.75 B: you know and 

167.46 168.01 A: (( a- )) 

168.08 180.80 A: but that yes after that one and the whole thing just blew out and then they had the other then then came survivor and i'm not really into watching people eat bugs and 

173.62 174.46 B: right 

177.91 178.62 B: no 

180.20 190.15 B: no i'm not i you know actually to be honest with you i'm not either i'd rather watch a good movie or something like that on t._v. if i'm going to watch it i you know sometimes i think the news is better than those shows to be honest with you 

185.63 186.70 A: right 

189.83 197.37 A: the only ones that well they're not really reality shows are like the the m- the star search ones 

196.99 198.53 B: right well 

197.55 201.40 A: i enjoy that more than any of these even though 

198.67 200.17 B: yeah [mn] 

200.21 205.99 B: yeah i think you're i think you're right actually you know you can probably call it a reality show in a certain way because i mean they're 

206.02 211.19 B: down to earth people you know in doing that but i think they're more reality than these other ones were 

211.50 215.52 A: yeah i think these other ones are people that want to be famous 

215.06 216.97 B: i think so too and they you know 

215.83 222.45 A: and they want to be noticed and and obviously it takes a special personality to want to do that kind of stuff 

220.61 221.37 B: oh 

221.50 226.73 B: well i suppo- you know i suppose it does i mean i wouldn't want to do it i couldn't do it but 

226.07 227.89 A: no neither could i 

226.90 240.89 B: y- you know i'm sure there are people that can but no you know i don't i don't even see what people get out of it i mean and i've heard people you know if they're missing the survivor and then they have to tape it and have to watch it again and all this craziness you know [sigh] 

240.91 245.43 B: and i don't i don't see anything in it myself either i agree with you a hundred percent 

245.14 246.23 A: yes 

245.59 246.47 B: you know 

246.54 248.71 A: how old are your are you 

247.94 252.74 B: well i'm fifty seven so i mean i'm you know been around [laughter] a long time [laughter] 

251.90 260.50 A: well i'm forty three and the little time that i have to watch t._v. i really don't want to spend time doing [laughter] watching that stuff you know ah 

257.49 259.04 B: no actually me too 

259.58 272.37 B: well this is it this is it i mean you know um there's not that much time in a day when you think about it you know a- with working and everything else you know you come home and i i just don't want to see a show like that 

272.12 274.72 A: no me neither either exactly 

272.74 273.72 B: you know 

274.06 275.41 B: you know um 

276.00 286.33 B: i mean it almost seems like you know it's you know even though like even the one where they had the bride and groom on and they said they were going to get married you know it wasn't going to be it wasn't going to last or it wasn't going to be a true thing 

286.73 287.66 B: you know 

286.79 289.71 A: no and what are the odds of um 

288.65 290.60 B: [mn] well this is it 

289.88 300.65 A: people that don't know really anything about each other and go on a couple of dates and for one it's just kissing and making out with the whole other group 

294.95 296.25 B: i know and 

296.37 297.40 B: you're right 

298.68 299.51 B: yeah 

300.01 302.55 B: oh yeah you're right yeah yeah 

300.61 305.95 A: i m- i mean what are the odds of a relationship like that really lasting 

304.48 305.55 B: that's right 

305.46 312.25 B: i mean you know it's not going to last i mean people that are in a a good relationship you know to go to start with 

312.17 324.07 B: end up separated or divorced too you know um and these people don't even know each other you know but i think you're right i think they're in probably for the name or the fame or somebody would know who they were 

324.13 325.89 B: you know something like that 

325.75 329.38 A: but let's face it a lot of people like just crappy t._v. 

328.91 332.40 B: well that's true that yeah you're right they do they don't care what [sigh] you know it's 

331.38 335.29 A: if if they didn't they wouldn't have picked monica lewinsky to 

335.07 338.28 B: to m- m._c. it right i know isn't that the truth 

335.53 336.72 A: [laughter] 

336.84 338.89 A: y- you know what i'm saying 

338.37 346.16 B: i think they s- you know somehow in even in that respect you think they're probably gonna people are gonna to look at it just to see her they don't care what the show is 

346.43 347.48 B: you know a- 

346.46 349.13 A: right but i'm not even interested in her 

347.95 352.24 B: and to me i couldn't care less about her myself too [laughter] you know [laughter] 

349.96 356.62 A: yes [laughter] i mean i i really couldn't care less about her i think she got too much publicity as it is 

356.04 360.64 B: right oh i think she did too and i think she only did it for publicity 

357.94 359.07 A: you know 

360.97 362.38 A: probably 

361.59 367.90 B: you know i mean number one if you or i had an affair with the president i don't think i'd want anybody to know [laughter] 

367.17 368.51 A: that's true 

367.92 370.49 B: you know [laughter] you know 

368.61 369.98 A: that's true 

370.31 373.25 A: no definitely yeah 

370.91 381.54 B: [laughter] you know but ah yeah you know i agree w- i agree with you too and and i think probably even the guys that are going on that show just wanna go on because she's there 

381.69 385.02 A: but did you hear that there's going to be a new um 

385.31 387.78 A: reality t._v. channel 

387.59 388.93 B: no i didn't 

388.60 389.87 A: yes 

389.29 391.33 B: oh are you serious 

390.56 401.03 A: yes i i think it's um some of the people that were involved in some of the reality s- shows um the actual participants 

397.81 399.17 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

400.44 403.65 B: oh yeah right oh no you know how is 

401.75 408.44 A: um yes they're putting together a channel where it's all r- reality yes all reality 

404.45 405.31 B: (( [mn] )) 

405.70 411.29 B: all reality can you believe it i mean you know i don't even think it's reality to be honest with you 

411.46 415.95 B: you know i mean [sigh] how how long how is this going to last you know 

415.59 418.45 A: y- you know what's reality is um 

418.54 422.42 A: you know those blooper shows where like candid camera 

421.62 423.93 B: oh yes yes that now i 

422.79 427.52 A: well there you go that's reality 'cause people react in a normal way 

426.49 438.88 B: they're under normal cir- circumstances exact- you're absolutely right i would think that was a more reality show than these other crazy yeah i agree with you on that too and that was kind of funny because you know it it could happen 

427.95 430.14 A: un- exactly 

432.39 433.46 A: yes 

438.80 443.28 A: exactly you can see yourself you know in those situations 

439.70 440.28 B: (( [cough] )) 

441.58 447.74 B: yes you're right yeah you're right you're right and i think yeah i think you're right i think that was more the reality than what's out today 

447.85 453.71 B: you know and people don't know that i think the people that are into these other shows don't even think of that show 

453.67 454.80 A: that's true 

454.27 458.11 B: you know which is sort of sad you know but i mean [sigh] 

458.24 460.56 B: i don't know i don't i don't agree with it either 

459.76 463.30 A: well you know what it tells you is that there's a lot of there's 

463.82 471.37 A: a huge amount of lack of love and warmth out there in the world that people have to really connect with t._v. 

466.48 467.90 B: yeah yeah yeah 

470.11 470.89 B: yeah 

470.99 472.42 B: i think you're right you know and 

471.59 478.58 A: and have a fantasy about being one of those people with a mask and taking it off and being the bride and 

473.01 475.08 B: yeah i think you're yeah 

476.65 483.12 B: yeah oh yeah absolutely right you know and i think people can't relate on a one to one basis with each other 

478.90 479.98 A: you know 

483.28 489.41 B: you know you know and that's and that's what it is and they feel this is the w- this is their outlet to do it you know but 

483.49 484.85 A: exactly 

489.44 492.10 B: no i [mn] i don't you know i 

491.33 494.95 A: do you know professionals that like to watch those kinds of shows 

495.22 496.28 B: i don't know 

496.39 498.47 B: there are i'm sure there are 

497.39 501.76 A: i'm i miss i'm i'm wondering the type of people that like to watch it 

499.21 511.34 B: i don't know oh yeah you're right what kind of people would watch it you know and it's sort of sad when you know people pick this as a priority to watch on television as compared to other things that they could be watching or could be doing 

502.07 503.12 A: yes 

510.99 512.57 A: [noise] right 

511.95 512.85 B: you know 

512.68 514.71 A: right absolutely 

513.05 514.00 B: you know 

514.01 516.26 B: um yeah you know and and 

515.36 518.07 A: no i'd much rather spend time with my children 

517.56 520.94 B: well there you go there you go i know uh you're right you're right 

518.29 521.73 A: [laughter] [laughter] you know 

521.10 522.70 B: i know i know 

521.88 523.87 A: or with my husband 

523.16 524.75 B: that's right you know 

523.99 527.31 A: i mean there's so little time every day for 

526.31 540.09 B: when you think of the hours in a day that you're apart i mean between work and going here and er- errands and all this and everything you don't spend that much time together anyway you might as well do quality time instead of sitting and watching a show like this you know [mn] 

528.02 528.91 A: yes 

530.42 531.50 A: mhm 

534.80 536.17 A: absolutely 

539.32 540.49 A: i know 

540.76 543.18 A: having some kind of personal connection 

542.63 550.23 B: well this is it and you know i've had so many people put themselves in that exact situation and say well if this was me i would do this or that and the other thing you know 

550.60 554.84 B: um but i you know i agree with you i don't think it's it's anything worthwhile 

554.55 561.27 A: i wonder how long they'll last as long as people continue to watch 'em or advertisers continue to 

556.45 557.25 B: yeah 

558.27 559.93 B: well that i'm sure that's what it is 

560.67 562.28 B: yeah yeah 

561.68 564.45 A: you know pay money during those slots 

563.81 569.13 B: well that's it and look at the advertising that even people are paying to to put them on you know 

569.24 570.24 A: true 

569.73 572.04 B: it's sad it's sort of sad because 

572.21 577.78 B: this isn't you know this isn't life i mean you know you figure reality is life and that's not life 

578.17 583.55 A: right no it's all fake and you have to go in under false pretenses like the guy that 

578.57 579.46 B: you know 

581.89 582.70 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

583.86 587.36 A: pretended to be a millionaire but he was a construction worker 

586.04 590.00 B: oh was a cons- right e- exactly there you go exactly 

589.56 591.94 A: i mean like why would you want to do that 

591.10 594.16 B: why would you e- you know and he knew all along 

594.21 596.68 B: he was he wasn't a millionaire 

597.19 598.30 B: you know 

598.31 599.95 A: and he picked this girl
