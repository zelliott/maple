19.26 20.84 A: and your feelings are

29.44 30.89 A: ah you know what i have 

30.07 32.65 B: 'cause i find it distracting from what i'm doing 

32.73 34.81 A: i have to agree i do to 

34.82 38.77 A: now when you go into excessive then then i can add other ones 

38.84 41.99 A: but smoking in any form is 

41.37 44.76 B: yeah there's the my tolerance there is pretty low 

44.24 47.71 A: yeah and mine i feel the same that's amazing 

47.92 49.33 B: yeah

50.07 53.97 B: and unfortunately my my daughter has recently taken it up 

53.76 63.53 A: is that right isn't that something i think my my son did that all we neither one of us smoked never never smoked in the house but then like well my son decided he'd smoke 

58.82 60.03 B: like social 

63.41 64.24 B: yes 

64.00 66.01 A: and i didn't know it for a long time 

65.75 66.78 B: same here 

66.38 71.64 A: till i went till i took him to the dentist one day and i heard the dentist when he was cleaning his teeth say hey 

71.83 76.49 A: and i thought nah no it's it's still in denial right 

73.63 74.43 B: (( [laughter] )) 

75.86 77.18 B: yeah 

76.64 79.10 A: and then one day he turned to me and he says um 

79.57 84.00 A: i need fifty dollars i'm going to pay to be hypnotized to quit smoking i said what 

83.51 84.67 B: (( mm )) 

84.09 85.49 A: (( yeah )) 

85.64 86.58 A: so 

87.23 93.09 A: to this day i don't know if he's he said it worked but you know as soon as you go back to it you're hooked again 

92.92 95.01 B: yeah yeah it's 

94.21 94.83 A: (( mm )) 

95.92 98.08 B: (( ah i think a )) 

98.16 103.10 B: long time ago i used to do a a pipe and it took me a long time to get over the attraction 

102.76 105.08 A: yeah i i i never would 

104.37 105.21 B: (( so )) 

105.20 109.42 A: i was never hooked on anything like smoking but i can understand it you know 

108.93 110.54 B: yeah 

110.41 111.81 A: they can do that 

110.81 111.63 B: (( right but )) 

111.84 117.04 B: but the only other thing i have you now i don't know where you live i've um 

118.14 121.82 B: ah i live in california currently i've lived in oregon 

122.10 123.13 B: um 

123.18 132.22 B: and most of the and i've lived in colorado and like oregon and and california are pretty much like restaurants are no smoking at all 

132.01 132.95 A: right 

132.62 135.20 B: colorado is like partitioned [laughter] 

134.96 138.98 A: yes that's how it is well i don't even know if it's partitioned here it's like it's 

138.22 140.17 B: yeah you get the zones 

139.61 144.42 A: right exactly yeah yeah california's pretty strong on that aren't they 

144.02 146.32 B: yeah i think um 

147.14 148.11 B: (( so it's )) 

148.31 154.36 B: but by the same token i've lived in colorado springs and it was the only place i saw people walking around with air tanks 

154.82 155.61 A: (( [laughter] )) 

155.82 156.78 B: so 

157.24 158.39 A: (( so )) 

158.16 160.11 B: i guess that says something 

159.60 161.58 A: what part of california 

161.47 162.53 B: um 

162.79 165.22 B: i'm just north of l._a. 

165.27 166.48 A: oh okay 

166.59 169.15 A: oh my cousin lives c- around that area 

169.43 170.32 B: oh 

170.65 173.58 A: (( um as soon as i can think of the name riverside )) 

173.73 174.85 B: (( oh okay )) 

174.51 175.43 A: yeah 

175.78 176.86 A: um 

177.01 178.58 A: we live in um 

179.13 185.02 A: south east ohio so we're in rural ohio actually amish country so it's um 

182.00 183.15 B: okay 

185.47 192.51 A: but that doesn't mean it's smoke free for the most part it is yeah when you visit people and things like that you know 

187.62 188.49 B: yeah 

188.79 190.14 B: yeah 

192.88 195.03 A: you're not around cigarette smoke 

194.67 200.84 B: yeah i find most people are probably more tolerant than they used to if you ask them not to 

200.44 202.50 A: exactly yeah 

201.81 202.77 B: um 

204.76 207.51 B: but i know i've 

207.89 219.86 B: i don't know i did th- there seems to be differences in culture even across the u._s. as to what's acceptable and not and so forth and so i end up seeing more smokers and like colorado 

219.95 224.94 B: seem to be more accepting their laws seem to be a little bit more lenient to smokers 

223.37 224.59 A: (( mhm )) 

225.25 227.61 B: and i saw a lot more people 

227.78 231.44 B: smoking in cars i just you know just get more visible 

231.36 238.35 A: well that's yeah that's how it is here even six- sixty miles north of us like i say we live in kind of rural america and it's 

231.45 232.42 B: and 

237.59 238.87 B: mhm 

238.42 243.39 A: and but i grew up in akron ohio so when i go back to akron to visit 

243.43 249.00 A: it's like you know everybody smoke in the house you know and down here you don't have that 

248.63 250.37 B: yeah 

249.42 254.00 A: and it's just sixty miles away fifty miles away and it's totally different 

254.25 255.43 B: mhm 

254.76 258.72 A: and so yeah i guess we kind of agree on that smoking thing i 

259.32 267.62 A: guess the drinking to excess you know when you're i guess the more thing i'm thinking about that is driving you know if you're going to drink stay where you are 

265.05 266.79 B: yeah i um 

269.28 273.35 B: yeah make allowances you know if you're going to 

273.38 275.00 B: like a company party 

275.00 275.88 A: yeah 

275.23 276.33 B: get a room 

276.02 279.13 A: yeah exactly that's exactly how i feel about it 

278.23 280.02 B: get a taxi right 

279.38 281.18 A: yeah yeah because 

280.46 288.41 B: yeah as long as you don't put anybody else at physical risk through your behaviour i don't 'cause whatever that behaviour is 

283.46 284.19 A: (( it )) 

288.11 289.10 A: yeah 

289.34 291.87 A: yeah yeah i don't drink but it 

289.38 295.42 B: i don't mind i guess that's what smoking is is it puts me at risk as well as everybody around me 

293.47 294.58 A: (( mhm )) 

295.64 296.77 A: yeah 

296.52 304.07 B: but i think that's what probably upsets me more is when people their through their behaviour put others at risk not just themselves 

303.41 317.56 A: right oh i know it just upsets me when i see a like a mother in a car or something and a baby and i'm thinking there's that poor little lungs you know it doesn't have a chance you know in that little car just packed with smoke yeah 

312.01 312.97 B: yeah 

314.97 316.07 B: mhm 

317.55 318.54 B: (( oh )) 

318.67 323.81 A: so i guess that's we've got to talk ten minutes about this huh [laughter] wh- 

322.31 323.41 B: [laughter] 

324.26 325.21 B: oh 

325.77 327.89 B: yeah i think 

328.76 330.24 B: i think that's 

330.30 331.22 B: um 

332.75 335.08 B: do they monitor us for what we talk about 

334.21 337.13 A: i i believe we are i believe they ah 

337.80 338.83 A: they do 

338.89 339.69 B: (( yes )) 

339.24 340.71 A: 'cause that's um 

340.18 344.32 B: so we're not supposed to change [laughter] the subject once they come to us and sensor us 

341.54 347.29 A: so we're not supposed to change the subject about bad habits [laughter] i bet not [laughter] 

347.47 350.08 A: it's kind of interesting i when did you sign 

350.13 353.49 B: um my actually my daughter signed me up yesterday 

353.13 354.97 A: up th- that's when i did too 

355.11 357.17 B: yeah she and 

357.23 366.61 B: that was the first time i walked in the door and she starts saying would you be interested in you know signing up for this and if i sign you up i get more money [laughter] 

364.13 365.41 A: is this the one that's 

365.83 367.85 A: is this the one that's smoking 

367.91 372.59 A: [laughter] what wait till you tell them ye- yeah and i talked all about you [laughter] 

368.04 368.94 B: yes 

372.12 374.48 B: yeah she's in the ah living room right now 

374.13 376.85 A: [laughter] that's funny 

375.77 377.98 B: [laughter] probably listening to me 

377.47 380.34 A: ah that is really funny um 

379.39 380.35 B: yeah 

380.51 386.14 A: i'm not even sure how it works my daughter just sent me an email and said hey you've got to try this it should be fun you know 

380.70 381.63 B: i think 

385.43 387.62 B: oh so it's your daughter as well 

386.94 388.44 A: yeah 

387.72 388.66 B: (( so )) 

388.91 393.02 A: but she doesn't smoke she has other habits but she doesn't smoke [laughter] 

389.34 390.19 B: (( mm )) 

392.99 399.12 B: yeah well i think part of it is with my daughter it was just i think the the group that she's in 

399.24 400.17 A: yeah 

399.54 400.51 B: um 

401.04 402.25 B: her um 

402.59 404.22 B: boyfriend smokes 

404.06 404.93 A: yeah 

404.48 408.18 B: i used to kind of pile his cigarette butts when they're together 

408.44 410.14 A: (( yeah oh well )) 

409.73 410.61 B: so 

411.55 416.49 A: yeah i thought that was kind of crazy now but i think the advertisers have a way of pulling in people that 

417.21 419.69 A: that wouldn't ordinarily smoke [laughter] you know 

419.07 420.71 B: yeah plus 

421.08 429.52 B: you know like any fashions come and go and sometimes you know being not smoking is fashionable sometimes smoking can 

421.45 422.28 A: 'cause they 

424.08 425.10 A: yeah 

427.66 432.65 A: yes exactly and then there's cigars i mean they're they're big on that now too 

432.01 433.83 B: oh yeah 

432.85 435.11 A: girls and cigars big

442.65 443.53 A: yeah 

449.59 454.24 B: i for a little while i tried the after dinner cigars in the display case 

454.17 455.14 A: yeah 

454.74 459.14 B: i think that was about for a minute with um cigars 

458.52 461.13 A: yeah but i think that's fashionable again 

461.20 462.08 B: (( mm )) 

461.32 462.88 A: that's that's back 

464.10 465.08 B: (( oh )) 

465.35 473.71 B: yeah actually i was actually i've seen a few articles on ah what you might call gourmet cigars you know very exclusive blends or you know

473.09 478.27 A: oh yeah and the and the i mean they're selling those now again 

474.19 475.57 B: that kind of thing 

477.78 480.55 B: maybe i've you know every time it's 

479.22 480.40 A: hot item 

480.79 484.76 B: ah after a while they start to when it becomes more rare they 

484.83 487.27 B: they it in to making it sheik again 

486.13 486.86 A: (( mm ))

511.94 512.86 A: (( uh-huh )) 

513.39 516.64 A: and i don't think they follow through with the i._d. thing too much 

517.32 518.58 B: um

537.40 539.02 B: and i don't you know 

539.27 545.00 B: i'm not sure i would trust them either particularly particularly in a rural area i remember it was fairly easy 

544.57 547.09 A: it exactly [laughter] yeah it is 

547.03 547.92 B: (( so ))
