49.92 51.11 A: yeah 

51.36 55.29 A: so we should so we should talk about the topic right 

53.22 54.87 B: yeah um 

55.34 67.76 B: so i i i mean i think there are bad aspects to each one but ah then again i participate in some of those bad aspects there [laughter] so you know but you know i think out of all of them um 

56.49 58.21 A: (( [cough] yeah )) 

62.47 64.72 A: (( [laughter] sure mm )) 

67.84 69.54 B: overeating's really bad 

69.41 71.68 A: yeah i i think um 

71.80 83.97 A: that's prob- i would probably agree ah your smoking is is horrible but it seems to me ah i mean i i i smoked for a long time but i was able to quit and ah do you know what once you quit 

73.83 75.12 B: yeah 

79.70 80.72 B: mhm 

81.46 82.43 B: yeah 

83.98 89.02 A: you ha- i mean there is it's i mean you can you can reverse a lot of the negative side 

87.69 90.83 B: yeah i know your body reverses i know i know that one 

90.99 99.50 B: that's true and then the same thing with ah yeah with drinking well i cert- with drinking if you destroy your liver you really destroy your liver 

98.94 100.51 A: (( of it right )) 

99.88 107.34 B: but um but still you could stop drinking and but you can also do both in moderate in in moderation and you'll be fine 

102.09 103.79 A: (( yeah um )) 

103.85 104.69 A: (( [laughter] right yeah )) 

106.15 112.69 A: right right yeah so i mean smoking is maybe harder to do in moderation than drinking but it's i think it depends 

111.07 113.15 B: yeah yeah 

112.82 121.33 A: i i i couldn't ah i couldn't i c- i couldn't smoke just one cigarette you know every once and a while i had to smoke a a pack a day eventually 

120.72 124.38 B: oh you know you know i i'm like i can isn't that weird 

123.96 126.52 A: yeah some people can some people 

124.50 133.32 B: i can smoke a a one cigarette today and then i can smoke chain smoke t- later on tonight and then go for a month and not smoke 

130.64 131.61 A: yeah 

132.56 134.87 A: wow how the heck that's great 

133.79 146.20 B: so i was thinking am i really addicted or not because i've been doing this on off and more than off and on but i mean i i do smoke but i've been doing this right i there are periods of time where i'm not with my gang of people to 

140.45 141.50 A: yeah 

145.56 146.51 A: [laughter] 

146.13 153.69 B: my camaraderie then i will and i'm really busy and i don't have access then i will not smoke and it will be 

147.17 148.27 A: (( yeah )) 

152.11 153.09 A: yeah 

153.94 156.40 B: and it's been going on for about five years now 

156.35 157.53 A: (( yeah and )) 

156.88 163.27 B: i don't know it's don't know about i mean people say you're really addicted or you're not addicted and y- and i was like well i must not be addicted then 

163.22 166.38 A: i think you're not addicted [laughter] 

164.51 167.85 B: i guess not i mean but you know what smoking's really easy really 

167.94 169.15 B: addictive 

168.62 180.16 A: yeah i mean i i have have i mean i know some people that have been were like that and for you know were like that for a few years just ah sm- smoking a cigarette every once and a while and eventually they started smoking a lot 

169.21 169.87 B: so 

179.58 187.18 B: yeah but i can smoke a lot and that's okay that's why i i mean when i i mean i know smoking is bad for you in excess but 

181.56 183.47 A: okay [laughter] 

185.11 186.31 A: (( [laughter] right yeah )) 

187.15 198.56 B: i but you know the effects of that asthma the effects are are not as immediate as with like over eating for instance where if you that becomes a really really strong psychological need 

193.38 194.53 A: (( mm )) 

198.42 205.97 B: like just like smoking is like also if it becomes an addiction it can be psychological and also bodily but if you over eat 

206.03 209.04 B: it hits all your organs at once 

209.02 210.77 A: yeah exactly that's right mhm 

209.25 218.01 B: because of because that becomes the not only psychological but it also becomes it hits your endocrine system if you eat too much sugar because that generally is the path of eating a lot 

218.08 231.23 B: then you have you develop diabetes which is which then involves medication or diet change then you could also develop other miscellaneous medical conditions i mean yeah heart attacks from the coronary 

227.57 230.37 A: sure heart attacks and yeah [laughter] 

230.91 231.90 A: sure 

231.37 237.69 B: build up from eating fat and so you're not even doing sugar anymore you're doing the fat from the meats and fats i 

236.19 242.24 A: yeah it has yeah and once you're and once you're you know dangerously overweight i think ah it's 

237.82 238.91 B: (( see that's hard )) 

242.54 246.87 A: one of the most difficult things ah you know to to to lose 

244.92 246.25 B: yeah that's 

247.06 250.77 B: yeah yeah that's why you hear about it all the time on t._v. 

250.76 265.36 B: you hear about these new things to um help you lose weight or medical advances for obese people well yeah because they- they'll just die a- obese one once you're obese you've already damaged the majority of your bodily systems 

250.80 251.86 A: yeah 

254.16 254.74 A: (( or )) 

255.48 256.54 A: [laughter] 

258.95 260.06 A: yeah 

264.68 265.62 A: yeah 

265.40 271.21 B: if you get to that point obese is really it's not being just overweight it's obese it's really overweight 

269.91 275.85 A: yeah but there are a lot of people in america that are obese [laughter] it's pretty yeah mm 

273.16 275.47 B: yeah it really does 

275.49 289.67 B: affect your ah every system smoking affects a lot of systems eventually and first and foremost it's the respiratory system but obesity over eating affects every single system right away and 

289.33 292.03 A: so do so do you drink a little bit 

291.45 294.33 B: i do drink yeah not so fast though but 

292.27 293.82 A: yeah okay 

294.14 295.72 A: (( and me too right )) 

294.57 300.18 B: it's fun to drink and smoke [laughter] except they have that law here in california where you can't do that 

296.64 297.84 A: yeah 

299.26 304.76 A: i know yes san diego th- all the bars yeah i notice it's been it's been like that for a couple of years so 

302.15 303.20 B: well see 

304.12 307.17 B: yeah you see i've only been here for almost three years 

306.72 307.74 A: mhm 

307.12 321.18 B: and um it really killed me so now i don't even go to bars isn't that sad i i don't go to any bars because i can't smoke in the bars unless it's one of the secret bars where they allow you to smoke because you're in with the ah the guy behind the bar but 

311.76 312.86 A: [laughter] 

317.13 318.17 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

320.89 322.63 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

321.11 331.77 B: but you know it's it's really difficult but people do smoke outside i mean we do we smoke in the parking lot and we just wait for a cop to come up to us and spend time giving us a ticket because 

325.93 326.77 A: yeah 

330.93 333.71 A: wait y- you can't smoke outside 

333.13 337.81 B: you're not supposed to smoke in public places and a parking lot is a public place like at the mall 

334.72 335.90 A: oh really 

338.23 340.44 A: so you can't smoke on the sidewalk 

338.49 339.25 B: but 

339.83 342.92 B: well that's a public place too it's like you can't smoke anywhere 

341.25 344.71 A: yeah i guess so [laughter] i didn't know that mhm 

342.90 355.87 B: so i was thinking well where can you smoke and i mean and the other thing too that i used to do all the time when i was in school was i used to go to coffee bars and like coffee places a- outside and just smoke but that's a public place now 

355.74 357.10 A: yeah sure 

356.11 365.35 B: here here and even i'm from new york originally and so like new york they just passed that law [laughter] and i'm like oh and they're up in arms because it's so new 

361.91 363.46 A: yeah [laughter] 

365.23 371.97 B: but i guess they don't realise that in a few years it's going to be really relaxed and people you will find places where you can do that 

369.15 370.17 A: yeah 

371.32 379.60 A: well i mean i i think i mean in i've read a- that the cali- in california the rate of smoking is a lot less than it is in a lot of other places 

378.96 386.56 B: it is now but [laughter] yeah yeah [noise] yeah i guess so [laughter] 

380.30 381.74 A: (( [laughter] )) 

381.79 384.06 A: (( but that's a- but that's good you know )) 

385.82 387.09 A: (( yeah it's )) 

386.75 399.25 B: i mean you know but there it is relaxing though it maybe that's just the the initial um like experience and then it's going to change because people do smoke outside you're not supposed to but they do 

391.92 392.85 A: [laughter] 

399.11 404.13 A: yeah well you can't have a million cops out i mean ah it's it's [laughter] 

402.72 403.58 B: (( yeah i mean )) 

403.96 413.35 B: and oh oh not only that let's well you know i heard that in new york that because people were so upset that they're starting to do recipes with tobacco and that 

412.73 415.83 A: wow that is yeah [laughter] 

413.64 420.08 B: that's kind of weird though that didn't happen in california i don't think i think that's really weird and out there and yeah 

419.30 432.86 A: yeah yeah well it's you know it's not good for you you know this i mean ah folks ah folks should quit but ah but there's you know there's a line you know there's ah it depends on how much you value your personal autonomy 

425.65 426.57 B: yeah 

432.49 433.53 B: yeah 

432.85 442.56 A: and ah you know and if you value it really highly you know it you sort i mean there's sort of sort of want people to have a right to do stuff but if they're not smart you know just because they have 

441.22 442.38 B: right 

442.59 447.68 A: personal freedom to do it and as as long as you're not hurting anybody else then the government shouldn't really be you 

447.79 450.11 A: know telling you what you should do right 

449.30 450.46 B: yeah 

450.68 451.95 B: yeah 

452.00 455.18 B: i wonder if they're worried about the health cost that's why 

454.81 465.75 A: yeah i think i think i mean i think yeah that's a big part of it i i don't know i don't know if there's a lot to you know i mean the second hand smoke that you get when you're wander- when you're working outside i mean i don't i don't think ah there's 

465.12 470.70 B: you'd have to really be in contact for great amounts of time it is dangerous but you know 

465.77 466.62 A: [laughter] 

467.68 468.86 A: yeah 

469.32 473.78 A: yeah if you live with somebody that smokes all the time then you i mean that's one thing but 

473.20 474.49 B: yeah 

473.89 481.82 A: but i think i mean yeah part of it is they want to you know reduce smoking figures people are a lot of people get lung cancer and don't have health insurance and the state has to 

480.58 482.64 B: yeah and then it goes to the government yeah 

481.95 483.33 A: yeah 

482.87 484.15 B: yeah 

483.52 489.87 A: well that's you know that's that's sort of that's semi-legitimate you know you [laughter] i don't know but it's it's 

489.23 491.93 B: well the same thing with um being obese 

491.35 492.75 A: yeah that's right 

492.12 501.39 B: we're not even the obese are just even overweight for some people genetically predisposed to problems but the government doesn't like covering those things but they need to talk about that if 

496.54 497.65 A: right 

501.24 502.08 A: yeah 

501.49 504.74 B: give us all free health club memberships 

504.07 510.86 A: [laughter] yeah well um there's like ah there's talk about giving people tax deductions for their health club memberships 

504.88 505.84 B: [laughter] 

510.40 511.47 B: really 

510.85 517.33 A: and some states have tried to put taxes on sort of sin taxes on fattening foods like ah 

517.16 526.93 A: you know like regular soda and big macs and that they they wanted to put an extra extra ta- tax on foods they think they thought that you know were yeah were bad [laughter] 

524.48 535.67 B: was bad oh my gosh you know how awful that's a- that's g- they're going to start crossing lines and they're going to start saying well what is bad and what's good and then you're going to get into like pregnant women saying but that's supposed to be good for me and 

531.04 532.77 A: right well that's the problem 

535.00 536.38 A: (( yeah )) 

535.55 543.84 B: you're taxing everybody and then you know see i can see the problem with that but i could but they also already tax us more for fast food did you know that 

542.75 546.19 A: yeah why is that right is they they tax more 

544.38 549.16 B: yeah go through a drive through go through a drive through and watch her tax go take a look at your tax 

548.20 550.77 A: is it more than a rest- than other restaurants 

550.27 556.54 B: well yeah it's more than because of the drive through tax or it's a fast food tax it's like twelve percent rather than five or seven or whatever 

553.44 554.46 A: really 

555.21 557.67 A: wow i guess they have it all right 

556.76 561.98 B: well i mean they every state i've lived in so far has done that so i'm like okay 'cause in iowa i've lived there 

559.43 560.28 A: (( right )) 

561.82 575.59 B: um there was i've lived everywhere but i've lived in iowa and they didn't have tax on food and then they had twelve percent tax on fast food i'm like what is this and then i went to chicago for grad school and they did the same exact thing like it was i think 

562.15 563.06 A: [laughter] 

569.12 570.09 A: wow 

575.51 583.46 B: i've forgotten what the tax was there maybe six point two five and then it was twelve point five percent for fast food and then i moved to providence 

580.55 581.39 A: (( wow )) 

583.77 587.41 B: and then to boston and and i was like why is there a tax on my 

583.97 586.23 A: (( mm )) 

586.75 591.05 A: [laughter] yeah it's horrible because yeah 

587.47 589.42 B: fast it's higher than normal 

589.50 598.90 B: and then i think it's the same thing here let me see i think it is the same thing here because um i mean why wouldn't cali- california follow suit [laughter] they 

597.37 599.95 A: yeah they're usually the first ones to come over the 

599.45 599.89 B: they're
