10.61 14.53 A: um y- i flip through 'em but ah yeah kind of 

14.34 22.79 B: yeah i kind of i've i've watched a couple of them but i i really thought that they were so cruel that i never watched any more i watched the one did you see it where 

22.75 29.57 B: um the young girls were were trying to get married to this young guy i forget what it was called probably the bachelor i'm not sure 

28.96 33.45 A: well yeah you got the bachelor you got joe millionaire you got um [laughter] 

32.25 41.92 B: okay it wasn't the millionaire one i heard about that one but [mn] by then i had already watched that bachelor one and i watched a couple of them [mn] and when as he you know rejected them 

38.79 39.55 A: (( ahah )) 

41.77 56.31 B: um they were real brave in front of him and very gracious and all that sort of thing and then they interviewed them again when they got in the limousine and left and they were just crying so hard and i just it just really broke my heart to see them do that so i didn't watch 'em any more [mn] 

56.74 57.96 A: ah 

58.02 59.27 A: (( yeah well i mean you know )) 

59.36 64.61 A: those particular reality t._v. shows it's like i almost want to gag 

64.61 65.52 B: why 

64.95 69.96 A: just because anyone who goes you know who at this point you know the first one 

70.11 75.96 A: you know yeah people might not really have known what was going on but at this point everybody knows what's going on 

75.64 77.78 B: mhm mhm 

77.18 84.00 A: so it's like ah yeah okay i [mn] what we really want is an acting job i think [laughter] 

82.90 87.32 B: yeah [laughter] yeah i bet you're right i wonder if the girls knew on that um 

87.39 97.49 B: on that millionaire thing i wonder if they if they ever got a hint that this this poor kid was really a nineteen wasn't he didn't he make nineteen thousand dollars a year or something as a construction worker 

97.60 106.62 A: which by the way just you know i used to do construction so yeah no you don't make nineteen thousand year as a construction you make a hell of a lot more than that 

106.08 117.57 B: i thought so 'cause i used to work at the unemployment office here in ohio and you know i took a lot of unemployment claims and they made a ton of money [laughter] so i thought that was a little bit fishy to begin with but mm 

109.58 110.72 A: yeah 

116.30 122.60 A: right but just you know and i actually talked to so- somebody who was a contestant on that particular one

127.30 129.39 A: and she said you know 

129.42 135.26 A: she knew something was up because just the way he was talking it just didn't click it didn't make sense and so 

134.85 136.16 B: oh 

136.18 138.52 A: she knew something was going on but 

136.24 137.16 B: yeah

179.93 182.67 B: i don't kn- were they on an island was that the deal or 

182.02 189.31 A: yeah exactly the the first one was on an island and you know basically you know they the the characters interested me

209.45 210.64 B: really 

209.69 214.55 A: and it was kind of yeah it was kind of cool to see how they were relating on this this island 

214.39 224.92 B: well what was the what was the concept behind i mean did they eliminate each other as as this went along is that how it [mn] was there something about getting together and voting who would go [mn] 

222.30 225.16 A: right they had ah they had competitions 

225.37 229.81 A: yeah they would have competitions and through the competitions would kind of um 

230.43 231.25 A: (( ah )) 

231.41 241.71 A: you know get like personality traits come out and then at the end of the episode they would have a little meeting where everyone would vote off one person off the island 

241.51 242.97 B: [mn] oh 

243.33 247.71 B: well that wouldn't leave that one person with a very good feeling would it [laughter] 

247.15 248.29 A: right 

247.81 252.28 B: wow so did you watch the entire thing then or just part of it 

251.37 253.44 A: just towards the end of the first one 

252.98 259.29 B: oh that's right you mentioned that earlier and i forgot so then that that's the only one you ever really got hooked into watching then 

259.31 264.96 A: well then i watched from there i watched the the whole series of the second survivor ah 

264.19 265.39 B: oh did you 

265.46 272.24 A: yeah two reasons one was because two of the guys were people that were from you know from detroit which is where i'm from

282.83 285.07 B: [mn] no what happened 

284.86 298.03 A: oh he just leaned too close or to the fire and kind of you know inhaled too much smoke and passed out and so he was you know basically burnt his hands and i i think w- was it his hands and face or just hands i don't know but either way

374.51 376.60 B: no i didn't hear of that one either 

376.70 378.30 B: i guess i live in a vacuum 

376.85 378.31 A: that one always got a 

378.68 384.21 A: i don't know why it it got like a bad night or bad time slot 'cause i know i couldn't even watch it um 

382.04 383.02 B: oh 

383.27 384.60 B: oh okay 

384.78 389.10 A: but the the few times i saw it it it was kind of funny 

389.01 390.03 B: really 

390.07 391.43 A: i mean yeah it 

392.25 397.73 A: it just i don't know i- it didn't take itself as seriously as some of these other ones did 

396.85 398.39 B: oh that's good anyway 

398.76 399.91 A: yeah 

399.00 404.72 B: [mn] i guess we're supposed to talk about why these thing- things are so popular but you know what mike i don't know why they're popular 

404.89 407.58 B: why do you think they are do you have an opinion on that 

407.92 409.12 A: um 

409.49 410.77 A: [laughter] 

410.86 414.96 A: why are circuses popular you know it's a freak show you know 

413.33 418.03 B: [laughter] [laughter] a freak show [laughter] that's true 

415.81 416.78 A: yeah 

416.79 417.90 A: people 

419.38 423.21 A: ah people i think people like watching train wrecks 

423.75 428.42 A: in fact i think that's the real reality t._v. that was the one that started it all was cops 

424.48 425.58 B: mhm 

428.76 429.95 B: yeah 

429.98 432.45 B: yeah that's true that's reality yeah 

430.56 431.37 A: you know 

432.55 437.03 A: in fact that's more reality based than any of the other things and it's just like 

437.43 438.32 A: you know 

439.21 442.91 A: [mn] sometimes things that aren't scripted are just 

443.45 445.39 A: you know just you [mn] 

445.63 446.97 A: more amusing 

447.19 448.71 B: i guess there's yeah 

447.29 449.59 A: it's like people want to watch the train wreck 

449.13 451.41 B: there's probably a lot more room for 

451.69 456.21 B: really wild things to happen than there is on something that's that's already scripted and written 

456.67 457.41 B: (( hm )) 

456.74 469.38 A: right 'cause you got that predictability factor in when you've got scripted things but you just don't know what's going to happen on these reality things although now it's to the point where you've seen so much that it's like okay [laughter] 

459.06 460.51 B: (( mm mm )) 

464.24 465.47 B: that's true 

469.38 472.75 B: hm i wonder if it's getting kind of hokey now for most people 

472.84 474.98 A: well do you remember that movie ed 

475.27 476.39 B: no 

477.35 483.05 A: um it was about somebody who agreed to sign hi or ed t._v. i'm sorry it was called ed tv 

483.16 483.87 B: (( mm )) 

483.44 490.41 A: and the premise behind it was this guy signs away his rights and they follow him around twenty four hours a day with the t._v. camera 

491.34 494.50 B: oh wait i think i did hear something about that yeah 

493.88 499.08 A: yeah that was a movie that was done well about five years ago six years ago something like that 

498.07 499.64 B: mhm mhm 

499.93 505.14 A: well now i guess it's to the point now where they're actually gonna try to do that 

504.82 506.29 B: are they really 

506.53 511.92 A: yeah i read somewhere that they're actually doing testing for that show 

512.22 521.95 B: oh i wonder if the shows are still more popular than than you and i seem to both hope i wish they'd just do away with them really but [mn] i can't figure out why they're so popular at all 

521.22 529.95 A: right they're i think that's what it's gonna come down to is i think everything now is going to have that reality slant until until people stop watching it 

527.40 528.50 B: (( mm )) 

529.51 532.85 B: mhm until the newness wears off or the novelty of the whole thing 

533.13 535.64 B: maybe that's why they're popular 'cause it's novel yeah 

533.38 543.44 A: hopefully i'm hoping that's the case but because i k- i kind of like the sitcom and the drama and now you can't watch as many of them because it's all reality t._v. 

536.57 537.73 B: (( [laughter] )) 

543.44 558.25 B: yeah i just like i said once i watched a couple of those episodes of that one with the the bachelor and that was that was not the construction fella but the other one [mn] and it was just it was too cruel and i can't figure out why people like to watch 'em i jut think they're a real drag 

552.16 553.03 A: yeah 

557.63 560.20 A: why di- why did you like to watch it mhm 

559.59 561.75 B: [mn] um actually i 

563.21 566.79 B: i watched it twice i got kind of curious to see 

566.89 569.25 B: which girl was gonna get this guy 

569.13 575.16 B: [mn] it was down to like i it was down to about three or maybe four by the time i started watching it 

574.93 584.88 B: but i watched it twice and and the one girl and i can't even remember what she looked like now but she sat in the back of that limousine [mn] and she was really heartbroken she was really in love with this guy you know 

584.77 587.83 B: and um or at least she seemed to be you know and she was 

587.66 599.95 B: she just sobbed her little heart out and i felt so sorry for her she'd been so brave in front of him and she was real gracious about you know the rejection and everything [mn] and then she got in the car and cried like a baby you know [mn] so i was curious to see which one of these girls
