186.58 187.55 B: (( mm )) 

189.80 191.20 B: (( oh okay )) 

191.48 192.60 A: so i know 

192.63 199.48 A: [laughter] every day was about eating [laughter] and people just kind of look at you know and i'm 

196.37 197.64 B: right 

199.49 204.75 A: you make friends along the way and you say let's do lunch or something if we meet up and they kind of look at you you know 

204.84 206.81 B: [laughter] 

205.31 207.42 A: why would i want to do lunch with you 

208.09 214.68 A: but it's just the way people are nowadays i mean if you're looking at the i mean even kids nowadays 

208.18 209.07 B: (( mm )) 

214.72 219.52 A: that's all they do they eat to escape the problems you know they have 

218.69 220.09 B: that's true 

220.24 223.80 A: and it's just outrageous a lot of these young pretty 

223.88 228.18 A: ah teenagers are s- just overweight because of the depression 

228.73 234.44 A: i guess it's better to have them eat than opt out and shoot themselves or commit suicide 

234.42 246.02 B: right right i and i agree with that but it's better to find some other more constructive way to to vent your your feelings or emotions than 

245.61 247.09 A: r- right 

246.26 250.45 B: than eating or ah overindulging in anything can be unhealthy 

249.89 253.11 A: you know join a y._m._c._a. you know or 

253.29 256.83 A: start a little summer group or something you know [mn] 

256.93 263.49 A: or start a a night thing you know after school meet and talk about your problems or find something creative to do 

257.02 258.92 B: yeah 

263.87 267.05 A: give your time to the homeless people or something you know 

266.73 269.93 B: yeah i think those are all good ideas 

270.75 277.34 B: compared to just sitting around eating and getting bigger and bigger because when people well normally 

277.70 280.62 B: when people overeat and you start gaining weight 

281.30 284.66 B: then y- you don't feel as good about yourself 

284.92 287.23 B: you're down on yourself even more 

285.12 286.32 A: (( right )) 

287.11 288.93 A: self-esteem goes down 

288.48 303.46 B: yeah and you you and and you you ate in the first place to make yourself feel better just temporarily i guess it's just like drinking the more you drink the better you feel up to a certain point and then of course as long as you're high 

296.04 297.30 A: mhm 

301.05 302.06 A: right you 

303.50 305.04 A: well yeah 

303.54 305.38 B: then when the high wears off 

305.57 308.80 A: and then you face the consequences of of your actions 

308.22 312.57 B: right and then it's even worse because not only have you um 

312.97 317.76 B: gotten drunk and and i mean not only are your problems back but you've got more problems 

317.73 327.99 B: 'cause if you get in the car and drink while you're drunk then you're probably going to end up in jail or killing somebody or something yeah 

323.17 326.53 A: killing somebody or you killing yourself 

327.64 330.58 A: you know drinking is a very bad thing because 

330.69 337.67 A: i mean a lot of teenagers turn to drinking and stuff and a lot of people opt out to drinking because that's their escape 

337.84 343.63 A: you know and i i really drug- i mean drugs and alcohol should be banned 

343.26 345.98 B: well when you were driving a truck 

345.99 350.34 B: did you ever take drugs to keep you awake 

348.98 351.69 A: stay awake no coffee 

352.58 353.63 A: caffeine 

353.67 354.76 B: (( okay )) 

354.66 358.88 A: coffee i- is my my wake up my get up and go 

359.45 360.80 B: got to have it 

360.31 367.81 A: yes but i have seen a lot of truck drivers drink drive do drugs and that was just 

367.91 370.40 A: not something that i i was really 

371.34 376.58 A: wanting to get to know the other truckers because when they started that you know 

376.61 383.60 A: hey here's some pills it'll keep you up tonight or here's here's a little bit of vodka something to keep you warm and y- 'cause you're hitting the snow 

383.52 392.51 A: no you know because we're out of here with big rigs and some of these people in these motor cars don't know how to handle the snow and stuff we might end up running over 'em 

392.60 393.56 A: you know 

393.50 395.41 B: yeah 

394.19 399.30 A: and i didn't really even appreciate someone asking me to take any type of drugs or alcohol 

399.70 403.97 A: you know and that was just ah that's my motto don't drink don't do drugs 

404.18 405.18 A: i mean 

405.24 409.01 B: well that's that's good how long were you a truck driver 

408.68 410.34 A: for eighteen years 

410.08 411.83 B: oh my goodness 

411.12 412.32 A: mhm 

412.01 414.14 B: that's a long time 

413.53 415.22 A: then i was a nurse 

415.06 416.74 B: [laughter]
