108.01 114.79 B: california we've already passed well in san francisco they already passed that law where you cannot smoke in bars or restaurants 

115.00 117.89 B: and i think that's what you're going to right now in new york 

117.29 121.91 A: yeah i mean it wasn't really well accepted but i mean out of those four 

120.54 125.54 B: but do you want to talk about this one because this is much more controversial right now it's ah you know 

124.58 128.95 A: i don't really understand i don't i mean we're supposed to say which is the worst 

129.17 135.78 B: no we're supposed to just choose one of the four topics and just talk discuss about it whatever you want to discuss about it that you know you think 

134.54 136.61 A: we could do smoking if you want 

136.64 143.34 B: yeah because i was thinking oh that's much more ah you know kind and if it's effective as you know effective in new york city right now 

143.33 154.04 B: it's going through here in california san francisco bay area because you know a lot of the bars and restaurants ah have already implemented that programme so you're going through it right now 

154.34 156.61 A: yeah i mean i know the 

157.97 160.77 A: i mean personally 

160.85 164.69 A: i don't smoke and i don't think it's healthy i think it's an addiction 

165.41 170.06 B: oh yeah i i agree i don't smoke at all myself but you know i guess the main thing is that 

167.85 174.29 A: i mean i think smoking pot is a lot safer [noise] you know 

172.79 173.95 B: smoking what 

174.49 175.95 B: smoking what 

175.44 182.05 A: i think smoking pot is safer and less toxic than [noise] you know [noise] tobacco 

177.39 178.28 B: oh 

180.42 188.04 B: yeah i think yeah that's ah yeah that's a herb that i used to do that but i i i stopped from about five six years now so 

183.43 186.63 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] 

188.31 189.31 B: (( ah )) 

189.10 190.88 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

189.79 192.63 B: as for smoking you know itself do 

192.66 193.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

192.90 199.69 B: you think it's still right for people to smoke in new york or like in california or not to smoke in certain areas 

197.95 203.15 A: [noise] well i think that i don't think it should be a law because 

204.76 209.03 A: [noise] i don't know i guess i just have even though i don't smoke i've always associated bars with smoking 

209.45 212.30 B: that's second hand smoke and that's the most important 

211.50 224.86 A: yeah i guess i never really was concerned about it it seems really extreme to outlaw smoking i mean i think it's i don't think it's really constitutional i mean it's not healthy second hand smoke is not good but i i don't think it's constitutional 

221.15 222.08 B: well 

225.30 233.88 B: well you know the thing is that you know fine a person could smoke if they wanted to which i believe 'cause i've done some studies where 

233.92 243.69 B: you know w- there was a lot of cases here in san francisco against the major tobacco companies you know because now people have been suing them because of you know ah them developing cancer or deaths 

237.17 237.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

244.03 253.21 B: but the thing was it it was an addiction now the thing is that i was feeling was that yeah sure everybody has their own choice you know freedom of choice to do whatever they want 

252.22 254.11 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

253.71 257.87 B: but if a person smokes in a combined area like a restaurant or a bar 

258.68 269.73 B: doesn't the person who doesn't want to smoke or doesn't or is allergic to smoke have that freedom of choice of having clean air not be- ah being imposed on second second hand smoke 

267.11 268.44 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

269.23 271.36 A: right i mean [noise] 

272.13 277.29 B: see right now that's i think there's a lot of things in new york is going on right now a lot of people will probably grumble 'cause they 

275.78 281.24 A: [noise] [noise] yeah they just put the smoking [noise] and it [noise] it's it's unconstitutional [noise] 

281.31 282.55 A: it is [noise] 

283.48 289.53 A: it's so some smoking is so main stream and it is it is laced with some kind of addictive 

290.17 300.47 B: yeah but you know if you don't smoke and you don't want to smell it don't you have the right to say hey look i don't care what you do but you know you're really polluting the air that i'm breathing right now 

291.07 291.96 A: thing 

300.06 308.96 A: yeah i guess i'm just kind of brain washed 'cause i associate you know smoking with being cool or whatever you know the prestige is sexy 

305.48 308.97 B: (( yeah but that that's just is that yeah i'm exactly )) 

309.28 310.54 A: but um 

309.78 314.14 B: you you aren't below you're less than twenty five years old or less than thirty years old 

313.72 315.90 A: i'm twenty four but um 

316.23 318.30 B: see i'm a little bit older than that so 

316.79 319.84 A: (( [noise] ah )) 

318.72 320.67 B: (( you know the thing is that it's )) 

321.57 322.74 B: (( ah smoking ))

327.01 330.44 A: that's what i was going to tell you the media [noise] brain washes us

334.12 335.42 A: yeah 

335.37 337.38 B: ah they're advertising in 

337.59 345.13 B: ah schools and you know and television shows or movies before they have the young people smoke and think that they're cool and everything else 

344.86 346.02 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah ))

347.12 350.74 A: it's it's like it's a brain wash it's conditioning 

350.42 355.65 B: yeah yeah that's what the media wants that's what the smoking p- ah companies tobacco 

355.29 355.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

355.89 361.43 B: were saying even though they're saying but hey no we were not but you know everything that they've been using

462.93 469.93 A: no i don't feel violated 'cause it it's just always it's always been that and that's how i grew up my whole life like 

469.26 470.92 B: (( so you you used to sm- )) 

470.02 471.43 A: being around smoke 

471.03 472.34 B: around smokers 

472.24 482.02 A: yeah but listen ah you know i was out a- the the the week that they put the cigarette ban in and people were most some people were still smoking 

479.34 480.12 B: (( ah )) 

482.11 484.03 B: yeah i know ah 

483.18 486.90 A: i mean in california do you find that 

486.23 492.54 B: well the funny thing is my my ah niece is a reporter for the daily news and she did a story on smoking 

491.85 493.11 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

492.86 501.52 B: and she was yeah she went to the bars areas in new york city to see what was happening and yeah a lot of people still let people smoke the only thing they 

493.12 493.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

501.79 503.45 B: (( ah in her article )) 

503.66 509.62 B: was that ah you know they may not give you an ashtray but they're not going to stop you from smoking 

508.69 510.47 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

509.81 514.82 B: you see that's that's what happened about a year ago in california san francisco area 

513.85 515.77 A: (( and i'm sure it was a year ago )) 

515.84 519.76 B: it's a little more over a year in the whole of california they had a ban 

519.63 520.44 A: uh-huh 

520.13 524.53 B: and the funny thing is it's been reinforced now so you go to restaurants and bars 

524.35 538.68 B: nobody smokes at the beginning initially yeah you know you have those people that say hey i'm rebelling i'm going to do what i want to do it's my own right to do whatever i want i don't care about other people if they don't want to smell um they they don't have to smoke but they don't understand that there's that smell 

534.19 534.99 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

538.40 539.12 A: mhm 

539.12 541.17 B: and you you could be allergic to it 

541.18 545.05 B: and they don't care take that into consideration they say hey i have the right 

544.92 545.86 A: mhm 

545.10 550.88 B: so what's you know at the initial time what happened was that it was a very relaxed situation 

550.95 556.14 B: until you had the smoking cops coming around and they were fining the bar owners 

556.13 557.43 A: the owners 

556.50 563.02 B: and it yeah because that's they're that they're they're they're supposed to tell people the patrons not to smoke 

562.63 563.65 A: yeah 

563.07 568.30 B: they're going to smoke they have to go outside you know and they're not supposed supply ashtrays on a bar 

568.40 573.89 B: and if somebody does light up a cigarette they're supposed to stop 'em and say there's a law you can't do that so that's basically 

573.14 582.95 A: there were a lot of signs that i saw in new york that said you know due to the new law there's no smoking allowed please do not give us any trouble we're only complying with the law 

579.33 580.08 B: uh-huh 

583.24 586.35 B: yeah it's it's new because like you said it just began 

586.55 593.56 B: you know it's not it so it's just new it took a you know a little while before everything in san francisco and the california and los angeles 

593.66 599.89 B: to really take an effect so you don't go you go to restaurants and bars and nobody really is smoking anymore they w- 

598.97 599.95 A: mhm
