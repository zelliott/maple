0.39 2.94 B: hi my name is anita lamber 

2.87 6.14 A: hi my name is bergita rascala 

7.42 13.57 B: and i did not hear too well what she said about the topic i thought i heard two different topics 

11.25 12.13 A: um 

13.32 19.68 A: yeah she went kind of fast i heard um the first time the topic was personal habits 

19.44 20.35 B: right 

20.13 29.67 A: and then she gave a list of choices of people's personal habits and asked which one we felt was the worst i believe 

29.32 30.49 B: okay 

30.08 32.06 A: and they were um 

32.13 33.52 A: (( smoking )) 

33.85 39.47 A: um drinking alcohol drinking caffeine excess- excessively 

39.54 40.65 A: um 

40.91 44.08 A: over eating and not exercising i think 

43.75 47.07 B: i think that's yeah your right she did go very fast 

46.79 52.95 A: [laughter] yeah there were a lot of them it would have been nice to have two or three maybe of those choices 

49.19 50.46 B: [laughter] 

52.37 58.01 B: i think so i think you're right also because you need more than ten minutes [laughter] 

57.40 58.97 A: right [laughter] 

59.06 60.83 B: well did you want to go first 

60.72 63.14 A: um sure um 

63.75 71.37 A: well i guess um out of the habits listed i would say that um smoking would be my 

71.55 72.49 A: (( ah )) 

72.64 78.62 A: least favorite habit of people but um it's kind of ironic because i used to smoke 

78.50 79.08 B: (( [laughter] )) 

79.04 80.99 A: and so [laughter] i think um 

81.05 85.31 A: i'm a little ah even more biased towards that as 

85.44 88.39 A: as a horrible habit do you smoke 

88.43 96.14 B: no i don't so but ah you spoke exactly as if it were i speaking [laughter] because i did at one time 

96.05 97.19 A: oh okay 

96.74 99.88 B: but that would be my number one really 

100.31 101.41 B: um 

101.42 103.45 B: bad habit i would say 

103.56 110.41 A: yeah i um it just bothers me when i see people smoking especially in front of kids 

110.35 112.09 B: yeah yes you're right 

112.11 118.58 A: ah holding babies things like that and it's kind of annoying to have people smoking by you when you're 

118.65 122.55 A: at a restaurant or you know trying to sit down somewhere 

123.13 125.04 A: but you know i used to be 

125.24 127.74 A: one of those people that did that [laughter] 

127.85 133.26 B: yeah i i was that way too at one time but thank god we're not any more right

137.35 141.43 A: twelve years that's great i've been about four years 

140.49 145.11 B: well you wouldn't want to any more and if you ever get the urge 

143.03 144.41 A: yeah

152.91 154.30 B: that i'm smoking 

153.54 155.99 A: mhm yeah i've done that too 

156.00 159.51 B: and i wake up shaking [laughter] 

157.94 166.35 A: yeah yeah i've i've dreamt that i've smoked and then i wake up and i have to really think about it sometimes did i did i smoke or [laughter]

169.24 170.35 A: mhm 

169.74 175.28 B: well i'm really so ah set against it because my step father died

177.70 185.20 B: the throat and and the lungs and all kinds of stuff like that you know it was just horrible it just went all through him 

185.43 190.93 B: and to see such a good looking tall handsome man go down to a waste of 

190.96 194.27 B: i don't even think he was eighty five pounds 

194.17 195.61 A: oh my gosh

196.86 198.62 A: and he was a smoker 

198.53 207.96 B: yes he was a smoker oh a couple of packs a day but the worst part of it is is that the truth of the matter is it is addicting 

199.95 201.10 A: mhm 

207.89 208.92 A: mhm 

208.37 212.79 B: and people don't realize that and the companies did it on purpose

213.17 214.22 B: and that's 

213.44 214.38 A: (( yeah ))

232.26 236.26 A: guy who um who worked for the company and then he 

236.28 241.22 A: um went to the public and told them about it and then they were he was in danger himself 

239.24 240.53 B: yeah that's 

240.90 244.43 B: that's right i forget the name or the man who even played it

296.44 302.70 A: and i'm never going to become a smoker but then i think i used to say that too when i was a little kid [laughter] 

302.36 308.07 B: i you know i don't know if i ever did because my mother and father both smoked 

307.80 308.85 A: mhm 

308.11 312.03 B: so it was like a natural thing to do and in those days 

312.41 315.37 B: you just didn't hear about it being cancerous 

315.13 316.22 A: mhm 

315.61 318.01 B: you didn't hear about it being harmful 

318.13 319.45 A: (( right )) 

318.29 321.36 B: you know i believe i'm much older than you are 

321.44 323.66 B: ah i'm in my sixties 

323.47 325.99 A: okay yeah i'm only twenty eight

329.34 332.53 A: right yeah i remember my dad's a smoker 

332.47 343.31 A: he smokes a pipe and i remember you know i knew that it was bad what he was doing because i learned it in school and you know i used to give him a hard time and my sister and i once 

332.53 333.73 B: mhm 

343.22 352.39 A: found all his pipes and threw them away and you know [laughter] we used to always rag on him for smoking and say that we would never smoke but 

352.44 359.10 A: she's four years younger than me and she she started smoking too [laughter] she's she's still a smoker 

357.96 358.63 B: (( oh ))

361.93 363.17 B: (( oh mhm )) 

365.19 367.18 A: she's sort of um 

367.47 370.31 A: you know it's hard to quit because you 

370.34 383.56 A: start doing these things and they're like she just moved this year to boston from chicago she started law school at harvard and so she's in this period of her life where she's under a lot of stress 

383.78 389.70 A: and you know that wouldn't have been a good time for her to quit because you can't quit when you're under a lot of stress 

389.50 391.97 B: mhm no it is difficult 

391.75 395.97 A: yeah so there's all these things going on in her life that keep 

393.00 393.81 B: but 

396.18 399.76 A: preventing her from really being ready to quit 

400.42 401.64 B: she can 

401.51 402.96 A: yeah she can 

401.99 409.28 B: it's really it's really an excuse that we use with ourselves when my stepfather wa- had his surgery 

409.02 410.09 A: mhm 

409.43 410.62 B: i had been 

410.94 413.39 B: off cigarettes about a year 

413.14 414.16 A: mhm 

413.42 423.79 B: and while he was in surgery i was in the waiting room smoking i went back to smoking after he's having cancer surgery isn't that awful 

418.27 419.30 A: [laughter] 

421.57 422.80 A: mhm 

423.32 424.51 A: mhm 

424.00 425.25 B: worst part 

425.09 426.26 A: yeah 

425.36 430.08 B: and he came out of the surgery and got home he smoked again 

429.77 431.98 A: he wanted a cigarette yeah 

431.39 434.60 B: he did he went right back to smoking 

432.31 433.37 A: yeah 

434.80 435.81 A: (( i know )) 

435.01 437.03 B: he knew he was going to die 

437.82 442.95 B: and so at that point you know he just didn't care but he lived through three years 

440.82 441.73 A: he just 

443.87 445.19 A: yeah 

444.62 446.10 B: with that horrible 

446.39 455.20 B: but i'm just um i think the american people in some ways are very stupid [laughter] sorry to say that 

454.54 455.92 A: mhm 

455.29 465.41 B: but we'll gang up together and and get to the president or whoever it is we have to get to about these companies being allowed to produce cigarettes 

464.95 466.09 A: mhm 

465.95 470.59 B: you know they say that they don't um spike the cigarettes but they do 

470.72 473.35 B: i don't know if they do any more but they did 

470.74 471.84 A: mhm 

473.08 476.73 A: mhm well nicotine is an addictive drug 

477.29 480.57 B: yes but they were also putting something else in it 

479.87 481.18 A: yeah 

480.68 483.05 B: if you remember from the movie 

482.84 483.96 A: yeah 

483.56 486.86 B: they were putting addictive substances in there 

486.65 487.82 A: mhm 

487.25 489.02 B: which was so bad 

488.83 489.95 A: yeah 

489.62 495.32 B: but that to me seems worse i think my second next thing would probably be alcohol 

495.67 496.59 A: really 

496.51 498.99 B: mm being a bad habit 

498.41 499.55 A: mhm
