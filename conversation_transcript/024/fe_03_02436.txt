0.21 3.50 B: hello [noise] hi how are you 

1.01 2.42 A: hi 

3.00 5.31 A: oh i'm doing just fine this is steve 

4.84 6.51 B: hi steve 

6.70 10.17 B: wow that was a long list of things [laughter] 

9.26 12.51 A: i wrote down three cussing alcohol and smoking 

11.95 21.19 B: oh okay you heard the cussing i didn't i did hear overeating not exercising [mn] and drinking alcohol smoking 

16.65 17.94 A: oh okay 

21.45 24.22 B: and i think [mn] gossiping okay 

24.08 25.36 A: gossiping 

24.80 32.12 B: i think ou- out of ah all of them what did you say cuss- cussing was the first one i don't know i think the worst one is probably alcohol 

32.38 44.43 A: well [mn] yeah as far as social ah costs yeah alcohol is just amazing and then the smoking um [mn] we spend so much time and money and resources on those two that um 

44.46 45.75 A: you know if you think 

45.87 48.83 A: globally yeah that that would be it personally 

47.50 51.91 B: [noise] but like smoking smoking hurts your body 

51.50 52.90 A: mhm 

52.31 59.11 B: but like drinking hurts your body and your soul because you know you mess up your family 

58.90 59.77 A: yeah 

59.23 68.21 B: you know what i mean because a lot of people abuse it m- most people i know abuse alcohol they can't handle it they can't go out and have one drink they have to go out and have twenty 

68.01 69.61 A: why do you think's that 

69.56 70.51 B: huh 

70.09 72.03 A: why do you think they're doing that 

71.51 74.13 B: well i think a lot of people have um 

74.67 78.85 B: i think a lot of people have issues and so they tend to bury 'em with alcohol 

77.74 79.15 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

78.96 93.24 B: um they have issues from childhood or whatever [mn] and um it really makes me upset because more people die from d._u._i.s than they do from lung cancer and [mn] [laughter] you know [mn] and and innocent people die you know from from 

93.00 97.92 B: from d._u._i.s children that i don- you know and [mn] 

98.27 105.28 B: alcohol is a really sad thing to me [mn] and they abu- a lot of people when they drink they abuse their children 

106.28 112.01 B: and they abuse their wives or their husbands or whatever you know [mn] their entire family 

112.16 114.92 A: [mn] do you think there should be prohibition again 

115.29 116.76 B: (( [mn] um )) 

117.22 129.37 B: n- i don't know i mean i know they would never be able to get away with it but in my personal opinion [mn] i think that [mn] um there should be done something done 'cause i could certainly live without alcohol [mn] 

129.62 130.57 B: (( you know )) 

130.33 144.06 A: yeah i i grew up w- [mn] i- in iowa and when i turned eighteen eight- iowa was an eighteen state so kids drank a lot in college [mn] and then now of course most states it's twenty one and and um 

139.09 139.89 B: (( [noise] )) 

143.97 157.96 A: i just it it must make a world of difference because of ah all the ah i know how we behaved at eighteen we weren't mature enough to handle it responsibly and we over- we always over drank 

157.59 158.54 B: right 

158.58 165.78 A: and it was like the the object of ah of all the parties you know that was that was the reason to party [mn] 

165.59 168.71 B: of course yeah and smoking was never 

169.15 182.63 B: based around partying or anything it was just like a cool thing to do [mn] it is addictive and yeah it is bad for the people around you [mn] but it's more like a slow process [mn] than alcohol where it's like an immediate thing 

173.61 174.56 A: (( right mhm )) 

182.59 183.42 A: yeah 

182.68 185.63 B: you know i mean to health it's not immediate but 

185.71 192.59 B: um if you're drunk and you're being a jerk [mn] then you know [mn] then it's pretty immediate 

193.16 196.26 B: [mn] then you immediately affect everyone around you 

195.82 197.42 A: yeah that's right 

196.44 207.18 B: i i grew up with a lot of drunks [mn] and um my best friend just ah quit alcohol [mn] and um he did say that quitting smoking is harder than 

207.50 216.10 B: quitting drinking but um the drinking affected his life in a whole [mn] different it's a whole different ball game [cough] you 

216.47 220.62 A: [mn] do you think it's it's it's ah different here than it is in other countries 

220.72 222.35 B: mean alcohol [mn] 

221.94 223.16 A: mm abuse 

223.06 224.59 B: um [mn] 

224.92 230.23 B: i don't know i'm not really sure but i know like um 

230.35 238.25 B: [lipsmack] like countries like britain and stuff that are real close to us anyway you know it's pretty just as bad there that it is here 

238.37 243.11 B: um but of course places that um aren't quite like us 

243.36 257.82 B: [mn] um i think that it's not so bad there you know [mn] i think it just all depends on what country you're referring to [mn] but like countries like um australia and [mn] you know and britain and places like that of course you know 

257.63 260.40 B: they're all just as bad [laughter] 

260.68 266.31 B: in my opinion you know i don't know i've never lived there so i've never really seen it 

265.50 273.17 A: yeah i've always had the sense that we all share pretty much the same problems there as far as alcohol abuse and and perhaps it's not as bad in [mn] 

273.25 279.35 A: northern european countries like finland and sweden and [mn] of course they say that alcohol is in worse 

279.37 282.27 A: in in russia than anywhere 

281.77 287.38 B: [noise] [mn] i can't imagine why with all that vodka [laughter] [laughter] [mn] 

284.14 285.62 A: [laughter] 

286.37 292.69 A: and i don't know what it's like in greece and italy and spain the s- the southern european countries but um 

293.45 302.35 A: [mn] we just you know it's it's it's s- so prevalent in in of course now they don't have the t._v. ads like they used to [mn] 

301.92 302.87 B: right 

302.36 304.70 A: um but it's still 

305.81 307.61 A: ah the influence 

307.63 317.25 A: both from smoking and alcohol and even guns [mn] all the stuff that we see in print ads and in advertisements it just makes it acceptable 

316.75 325.78 B: yeah oh definitely [mn] but i think there's other things that are wrong but i mean like overeating and not exercising [mn] 

325.66 334.54 B: yeah it's bad for the long term but i mean i guess if you really overeat and you were like five hundred pounds and couldn't get out your door [mn] i guess that would affect 

334.73 335.96 B: you know your 

336.04 343.30 B: family life but for the normal american overeating is like going to mcdonald's twice a week 

343.69 356.47 B: you know it's not like where they're five hundred pounds and can't move [mn] it's just that they're [mn] you know thirty or forty pounds overweight and in my opinion that's not really i think we [mn] we expect too much out of ourselves sometimes 

356.83 369.97 B: and i think we put um labels on people and [mn] you know not everybody's meant to be barbie dolls and kens you know if we were we it would be a very boring world [laughter] you know 

368.57 370.75 A: mhm yeah that's right mhm 

370.30 376.21 B: if everyone walked around and everyone was skinny and fit [mn] it would just be a very boring place 

376.31 383.56 B: so the overeating and not exercising i think you know 'cause i actually hate to exercise like on purpose 

383.66 388.99 B: i'd rather go out and go hiking or go swimming just for just for fun 

389.01 393.32 B: you know and that is technically exercise because i'm doing something but [mn] 

393.35 399.64 B: i'm not going to just go out and exercise on purpose like i can't go into a gym i get bored really fast 

399.76 408.94 A: [mn] well i i go to the gym a couple of times a week and i'd rather not i mean i went to tomasco canyon for a hike last weekend and i'd prefer to do that that's that's a lot more fun 

399.93 401.11 B: (( [mn] )) 

409.00 412.35 A: and it's just as good a workout um but [mn] 

412.43 423.91 A: i guess to to best organize my time or manage my time i've i've fallen into that that rut of ah going to the gym but [mn] you gotta 

424.23 426.97 A: be active in other ways too i think so 

426.60 432.45 B: right well i ride my bike um but i normally ride it to places around town 

432.27 433.36 A: mhm 

432.83 434.52 B: just for exercise 

435.00 440.00 B: and um but i don't mind riding my bike around town because i'm actually accomplishing something 

439.85 440.98 A: oh yeah 

440.35 448.94 B: you know i'm going to the post office i'm going to the grocery store i'm not just going on my bike just to ride for exercise like that would be very boring [mn] and um 

449.32 458.46 B: [lipsmack] so [mn] i don't know for the most part as far as exercise and stuff goes it's like you know if like if you can fit it in now in the in the winter 

458.50 472.23 B: [mn] you know i it's like the most exercise i get i guess is shoveling snow [mn] so [laughter] i live in maryland [mn] i just feel like this winter i did nothing but shovel snow [laughter] 

465.46 466.78 A: where do you live 

471.19 474.18 A: it's always heavy wet snow in maryland 

473.86 475.11 B: yes 

474.95 482.57 A: yeah i i live in los angeles so ah and i grew up in iowa so i i i i certainly did shovel a lot of snow 

482.64 485.84 A: and ah i don't miss it at all [laughter] 

485.88 492.30 B: i certain- i certainly didn't mind it at all actually [mn] but it was a lot so um [lipsmack] 

492.60 495.21 B: um you know for the most part 

495.74 498.41 B: [mn] and what else did they say gossip 

498.58 500.28 A: gossiping and cussing 

500.44 503.32 B: well i don't really see how cussing could be 

503.66 510.76 B: i mean it's just a word [laughter] you know and i don't really see it as a bad thing it's like okay whatever [mn] 

510.20 514.07 A: do you think it's a reflection on someone's education 

514.01 521.12 B: i don't think so i know really smart people really intelligent people that have been through all kinds of education that cuss 

521.57 529.77 A: and wha- what makes 'em cuss are they frustrated or are they [mn] i know that when i've cussed it's when i'm angry and i just can't think 

529.38 530.47 B: right 

529.99 535.07 A: logically and calmly and put my thoughts down concisely and i 

534.48 535.39 B: um 

535.27 538.38 A: just choose the easiest thing [laughter] 

538.13 541.53 B: i i think sometimes [mn] um 

542.42 548.10 B: you know it's it's partly frustration and sometimes they're just using it as an expression 

548.34 550.63 B: you know [mn] um 

550.73 552.39 B: (( it's like [cough] )) 

552.89 558.36 B: like have you ever heard someone like talking about a bad situation [mn] and um 

558.70 568.57 B: you know they're talking about a bad situation and they'll be like i can't believe that that's an arsehole you know or something like that and it's just their way of of telling you 

563.99 565.07 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

568.53 574.14 B: how bad this person was to them [mn] it's sort of like an expression sometimes [mn] 

573.95 585.81 B: you know i mean i guess they could use deeper words but at that point they were just trying to express themselves [mn] you know so i think i think when i when i you know listen that when people cuss i don't really 

586.18 599.36 B: i don't really think twice about it now if i hear some kid walking around just saying a cuss every three seconds i start thinking i'm like what [laughter] you know but if he if he falls off his bike and says shit i'm not going to um
