3.92 5.22 A: i'm fine 

5.32 6.55 B: [laughter] 

5.56 7.48 A: my first phone call 

7.03 8.64 B: oh this is my second one 

8.82 11.69 B: okay reality television huh 

11.78 13.18 B: well do you watch any 

13.26 16.17 A: uh the only one i watch is survivor 

15.74 20.23 B: okay i i don't really get a a chance to see that often i saw the first one 

20.23 32.84 B: and not all the way through but i read up on it every you know every week they have something in the papers regarding it so that's how i keep up with it but i watch uh anna nicole smith and i watch the osbournes i watch that kind of stuff 

32.22 34.19 A: oh wow [laughter] 

32.95 38.31 B: yeah 'cause i because i i i'm a cable fanatic i don't really watch uh regular television 

38.75 41.01 A: okay great yeah i 

39.28 40.82 B: y- yeah 

41.10 45.29 A: kinda wondered on that anna nicole and if it was any good [laughter] 

44.36 47.16 B: well let's put it this way i- it's unbelievable 

47.39 53.79 B: yeah let's put it that way i don't know if it's good you wouldn't say it was good but it's unbelievable that someone could be like that every day 

54.09 66.95 A: [laughter] okay well i know with survivor here at our house when you wake up thursday morning it's survivor day and and we set our schedule by it and i never thought i'd be a person to watch that so 

60.49 62.31 B: [mn] really 

66.36 68.40 B: wow what's it like 

68.40 70.11 A: [lipsmack] um 

71.32 79.52 A: i i guess the reason i like to watch it is because you get to see the sneaky underhanded way people work together and 

78.73 80.19 B: ah 

79.79 92.59 A: i- i mean you get to see everything pretty much that's happening while you know the the members there don't really get in on what the other people are thinking and and plotting and [laughter] 

92.41 93.49 B: wow 

93.23 99.37 A: [laughter] it's just kinda like um being a fly on the wall i guess to all of this 

98.84 109.14 B: right well what ah o- on the those that have actually won the money the winners what did you think of that person do you think they were entitled to the money or should it have gone to someone else 

99.59 100.33 A: [laughter] 

108.03 118.71 A: oh [lipsmack] i you know i've only watched a couple of series all the way through but i don't think the person who really deserves it ever wins [laughter] 

115.80 116.38 B: (( [noise] )) 

118.16 122.65 B: that's true i i know the first one that older guy rudi i thought he should have won 

121.32 122.20 A: yeah 

123.06 124.17 A: yeah 

123.50 136.39 B: i really do i thought he should have won i thought that he um handled himself very [mn] i don't know i just thought he was just a gentleman throughout you know and i guess as y- you said you can't be that way you have to be cut throat [laughter] 

130.90 132.10 A: [laughter] 

134.36 142.16 A: well it's true yeah the nice people don't win it's the people who are more devious and are into the survivor game so 

138.97 139.55 B: (( [noise] )) 

141.83 142.93 B: wow 

142.21 152.11 A: um the it's i- i always wonder at what cost you know i mean they win all this money but then everybody who knows them or 

151.28 158.31 B: now knows what they're like they're deceitful people right [laughter] [laughter] so you lose all your friends [laughter] 

152.50 155.24 A: yeah [laughter] right 

157.32 161.02 A: so what do you think on why they're so popular 

160.50 166.58 B: well i think p- people need something different i think that uh you know i- it's an environment now that 

166.48 171.43 B: um i know that uh post nine eleven it's been really tough for people 

171.27 185.62 B: um and i i happen to live in new york and worked in the royal trade i- it was very difficult i think now you just want to see the world as it is no rose colored glasses you just want to see it you know whatever's there is there and you know you try to as you say survive 

185.60 189.51 B: how do you survive when you you know have been through something that's so traumatic 

189.79 195.49 A: yeah mhm yeah i i i think part of it too is it's not movie stars it's 

189.82 191.83 B: so it 

195.76 196.71 A: people 

196.36 204.47 B: yeah but what about the one with the movie stars did you see the one there's really a show now that has uh like melis- melissa rivers in it 

204.26 213.33 B: and some models and whatever same thing they're like it's it's the survivor -vivor but with actors and actresses and they are really cut throat 

211.19 212.46 A: (( just mm no i haven't )) 

213.03 215.30 A: [laughter] oh boy i bet 

213.92 220.31 B: oh it was something else i mean it was really and you know who ended up winning uh jennifer lopez's second husband 

220.05 221.28 A: oh really 

220.65 221.75 B: yeah 

222.18 223.02 A: hm 

222.57 234.06 B: and he was really nice actually the whole show he was really nice and i thought well that's nice that he won and yeah that's the first time i've ever seen somebody in a but melissa rivers was really exceptional she was an exceptional survivor 

233.80 234.64 A: hm 

234.49 240.15 B: so her mother taught her well she hung in there no matter what and i love the fact that i saw the stars without any make up on 

240.57 245.72 B: made me feel good [laughter] [laughter] all those beautiful women i was like okay now we really see 

241.42 243.10 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] yeah )) 

245.88 250.67 B: so that was pretty good i don't know um what about yourself what do you think why people watch 

250.90 253.22 A: i i think um 

253.47 256.03 A: that probably you know not [mn] 

256.09 259.47 A: it's not stars you know um 

259.52 261.12 A: otherwise 

261.15 261.90 A: (( a- )) 

262.17 271.43 A: maybe 'cause it's not plotted out necessarily i i have no idea why i mean i can't even say for sure why i watch it 

265.03 266.49 B: right 

270.80 272.73 B: right but you get hooked don't you 

272.31 275.21 A: yeah something's appealing about it but 

274.19 288.00 B: exactly it is it's just it's a very appealing i don't know and once to me you really start to g- you you look forward to next week you're like okay you know it's almost like a book you know you get to that book and it's really interesting you're like i can't wait to the end and then when you get the end you're like ah i don't 

282.81 283.87 A: mhm 

287.89 289.07 A: [laughter] 

288.51 297.10 B: know maybe i'm hoping the author writes another one you know of the follow up and then you buy it and you know [mn] that's just how we are we want to keep going 

291.93 293.03 A: yeah 

297.16 305.16 B: especially if it's a i- if it's a good theme or a good thought you wanna see and you know i think we like survivors we like those people that are able to hang through it all 

305.55 306.47 B: (( you know )) 

305.58 313.09 A: true a- and you pick someone that you want to win and and you follow 'em and uh-huh [laughter] 

310.44 313.86 B: right you're rooting for them like come on you can do this [mn] 

313.33 314.43 A: yes 

314.71 316.15 A: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

315.54 322.53 B: what happens when the person that you were rooting for though doesn't make it do you stop watching or do you continue to watch 

322.03 332.86 A: well this just happened like the week before last my favorite person got voted off and i wanted her to win but i knew she wouldn't just because i you know i felt like she 

332.91 340.72 A: was a strong leader and stuff and i just knew that eventually they'd take her out and she did and i thought well i don't wanna to watch any more 

340.72 348.49 A: well the next show there's a big turnaround and all of sudden it's interesting again so [laughter] so i'm right 

346.37 357.75 B: okay all right so then you pick a new hero what it i- it appears that that the watchers were flexible okay well the one we wanted to go didn't we're not going to keep watching let's see who is going to win so we choose a new 

357.25 359.79 A: [laughter] 

357.71 366.31 B: favorite yeah i tell you our allegiances you know we hang right in there don't we we're like okay you didn't make it okay now i'll pick ted over here [laughter] 

365.06 368.65 A: yeah yeah well there's someone's gotta win [laughter] 

367.05 374.42 B: yeah someone's gotta win you know i tape would you if you would you ever think about being on one of shows 

368.91 369.68 A: [laughter] 

373.53 375.82 A: absolutely not [laughter] 

374.81 384.99 B: no i wouldn't either i mean i- i i i'll have to work for the rest of my life to make that kind of money you know and another life after that but i i just couldn't do it just couldn't do it 

376.21 377.10 A: no 

383.47 392.23 A: no i just i have no interest i think my fiancee would be terrific at it um [laughter] 

391.52 397.22 B: yeah mine too actually yeah but he's too p- he's too uh private he would never 

392.99 394.40 A: [laughter] but 

397.24 398.73 B: allow you know 

398.85 401.69 B: his to be exposed like that just never ever 

401.67 408.98 A: oh y- yeah my my fiancee he is definitely um [mn] he would be a survivor 

408.85 418.13 A: i i don't know if he can be devious enough but otherwise i mean i think he could do it [laughter] i would feel sorry for everyone [laughter] 

412.23 414.01 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

415.04 419.29 B: oh well that's good really oh boy 

418.87 420.34 A: (( yeah 'cause ))

421.31 422.60 A: [laughter] 

422.95 435.69 B: you know i tell you i wonder how they select i've never seen um anything like on a website [noise] when they start to select those those people that you ever seen like an application or something i don't even know how those people are selected 

433.65 434.35 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

434.37 440.04 A: i have i have seen a few things here and there passed around the net um 

440.52 446.14 A: [lipsmack] i don't know what they go through but i know they have to b- uh send in like tapes of themselves and 

445.25 446.36 B: oh okay 

446.28 449.44 A: all kinds of stuff like that so [laughter] y- 

448.59 457.31 B: almost like a [lipsmack] what's the the real world i know how the real world in uh r- road rules their reality shows as well on cable same thing 

455.01 455.95 A: yeah 

457.01 462.63 A: i used to watch i think it was the real world was that through m._t._v. 

460.12 461.57 B: oh y- i love that show 

461.97 471.24 B: yeah that's one of my favorite shows because i mean those people i mean living together in a household for four to six months is not easy you know 

463.79 464.92 A: yeah 

470.04 472.87 A: yeah and most of 'em are pretty young yeah 

472.08 475.63 B: yeah they're like under you're supposed to be under twenty five [noise] 

474.68 477.14 A: yeah so they kind of 

477.87 481.44 A: sometimes their interpersonal skills are [laughter] lacking 

480.84 485.55 B: exactly and they all come from different backgrounds and that you know that's interesting 

485.68 487.96 B: to see how you all work together you know 

488.38 491.85 B: and so wow but that i like that 

490.22 494.39 A: i believe that's like th- that might have been the first reality 

493.57 504.18 B: it was that exactly the real world was the first then road rules came along was like a spin off of that it's almost for those people who didn't quite make the first cut of of uh real world they then got a chance to 

494.66 495.85 A: t._v. s- 

496.30 497.25 A: yeah 

504.26 506.94 B: go onto um road rules 

506.32 513.16 A: uh y- i saw road rules a few times too but i didn't i don't think i quite liked it n- you know as much 

507.73 509.45 B: yeah 

511.66 518.67 B: well you gotta be really athletic to be on that show and if you're not athletic um y- you you won't you won't make it i 

518.23 528.94 A: [lipsmack] we we tried to start watching uh something called amazing race i don't know i think it's called amazing race isn't that out of like canada or someplace or 

528.02 531.44 B: don't think i've seen that is that on uh cable or is that on regular television 

531.09 532.93 A: uh regular television 

532.28 534.57 B: oh i've not seen that oh okay 

533.70 542.67 A: yeah it's a i- it was pairs of people and it was a survivor kind of game but it was more like a big um 

542.79 551.93 A: almost like a big scavenger hunt and and each time you know whoever was slowest they're the ones who got dropped [laughter] so 

544.11 546.19 B: [noise] yeah oh 

550.28 554.39 B: wow well you know y- you that's what the weakest link 

554.43 556.45 B: you know goes bye bye 

554.62 559.15 A: yeah it w- it it was yeah it wasn't about picking who you thought was your 

559.18 564.05 A: your favorites or anything i mean whoever was slowest was done they're out 

562.87 568.77 B: [sigh] that's pretty much how um road rules is too nowadays you know if you're slow you you're dropped 

569.39 570.97 B: (( you know wow )) 

571.46 585.76 B: couldn't do it just couldn't do it i think it's gonna run its course though i believe that people are gonna go back into their fantasy worlds and they're gonna want to start seeing something different so i think that you know give these reality shows another two years and people won't watch them again 

585.54 590.34 A: true like the more ridiculous they get to um i i think 

590.41 595.72 A: the more [laughter] more people that will just finally say you know i've had enough [laughter] 

595.10 599.38 B: exactly i have had enough of this let's let's do something else you know
