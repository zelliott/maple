43.83 53.42 B: go into a pool of people and and then date them for that short period of time and end up in a marriage situation what 

53.04 54.70 A: right now

64.86 66.06 A: oh really 

68.77 69.76 A: uh-huh 

69.64 73.86 B: so they let us talk and um tell us when your ten minutes is up 

73.69 85.44 A: i see so um all of those shows for instance my wife watches these shows and she really loves this thing she thinks it is just neat to see who the heck is gonna get to the level 

85.26 95.73 A: that's going to win and when on top of it when uh like i don't really keep in touch with those things because it's not me you know what i mean i'd rather watch a movie or something 

95.98 97.69 B: right [laughter] 

96.59 110.33 A: but i see her rooting rooting for a certain individual or a certain party she's not like i can see where like you know these shows do capture the regular you know people at home you know

129.80 134.51 A: know like it bachelorette and survivor and all of that other good stuff 

134.42 148.45 A: you know it i just think it's just a bunch of crazy things like reality t._v. is even another crazy show i mean as far as saying crazy is is that you know these people out there really are coming up with some unique ideas you know 

147.86 155.81 B: right that's one of the questions they asked was why do you think they they are popular and i think 

155.75 163.58 A: i mean would you go on a show and eat bugs and jump off the side of buildings or have them pull flags from a building i mean it's at little scary 

160.32 161.24 B: [laughter] 

163.37 176.60 A: and my wife said she would go on survivor yeah right let me tell you something is not so easy and she sits there and you know they they say it looks easy when you watch other people do it it's really not that easy where 

167.03 168.12 B: [laughter]

197.72 199.48 A: fear factor 

198.93 208.39 B: that was wicked because they you know like i guess they they just capitalize on your fears and if you're scared of spiders what's going to be on there 

208.59 211.00 B: so it was kind of weird and this one 

211.13 213.83 B: the poor people who were on it were um
