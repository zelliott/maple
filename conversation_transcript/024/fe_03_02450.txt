0.77 1.92 A: hello 

0.98 4.48 B: [mn] hi hi [mn] my name's mary 

2.17 3.38 A: [laughter] 

4.14 5.85 A: okay my name is marla 

5.61 6.60 B: oh hi 

6.24 7.84 A: hello [laughter] 

7.19 9.24 B: i'm in massachusetts 

8.90 10.42 A: okay i'm in ohio 

10.13 13.42 B: oh very good [laughter] 

11.50 12.72 A: [laughter] 

13.86 16.19 B: how's the weather in ohio today 

15.28 17.90 A: oh it's very very beautiful today 

17.33 18.71 B: (( oh is it )) 

18.11 19.64 A: yes it is 

19.05 22.13 B: we have rain here today [laughter] 

20.33 22.75 A: oh [laughter] 

22.23 29.93 B: but we usually get your weather like the next day you know it it comes across you know heads east from you guys 

25.00 26.53 A: oh that's good 

28.29 29.37 A: right 

29.66 30.63 A: right 

31.66 32.63 B: (( [mn] so )) 

33.75 36.95 B: what do you like about do you watch reality t._v. 

36.63 43.14 A: um [lipsmack] well i'm not sure which ones are considered the reality t._v. shows um 

43.34 48.66 A: [lipsmack] i'm not a big fan of survivor i've i've watched it um maybe once or twice 

48.17 49.16 B: yeah 

49.04 52.81 A: um and i- i'm trying to remember the other ones they meant oh the 

52.89 60.02 A: [mn] the millionaire thing um [mn] i don't really care for those only because i think that's very deceptive 

60.10 64.06 A: i think that the women like the the joe millionaire 

63.84 76.17 A: program i think it it made women think one thing when it wasn't the truth and to me if you're setting up a relationship based on lies then there really isn't anything there to base a relationship on 

68.86 70.20 B: oh yeah 

76.57 87.77 A: [mn] so i think that was not i i don't care for those kind of shows if you're not going to be realistic about it and be and actually be up front about everything then to me it's [mn] it's not you know a good show 

87.64 91.78 B: yeah and i think there's another one coming out like that too where it's deceptive 

91.47 92.45 A: yeah 

91.98 94.76 B: um whereas you know at least the bachelor 

94.62 95.58 A: yeah 

94.96 99.05 B: that's usually a rich person but you know it's not a lie 

97.55 98.50 A: yeah 

99.41 107.26 A: well the only thing i don't like about those though either to me is it's sort of like you're putting yourself in a position to be on display 

107.30 110.21 A: for like um one person who's 

110.05 120.56 A: deciding among all these women d- dating all of them at the same time and all that and there's nothing wrong with dating different people i mean if you're not married and that i understand that's not a problem at all but [mn] 

120.49 131.57 A: i don't know i just feel like that they they go into it with the impression like [mn] you know that um he's only going to be with her or [mn] because i've seen the first one i think it was 

131.48 138.21 A: and i think that there was a lot of fighting among the women based on what they were doing when they went out on their dates and that and i think that's kind of 

138.31 140.20 A: ridiculous [laughter] 

139.31 141.95 B: it is ridiculous and the other thing is like 

142.14 147.69 B: p- people can't possibly get to know each other well enough for him to decide anything 

145.18 149.65 A: exactly especially to get married right after [laughter] 

148.51 159.89 B: i know well at least they're not ge- like that last one that last couple there that broke up that was sad but ah but it's like you know what made her think she knew him all that well anyway 

152.10 153.14 A: yeah 

153.55 155.56 A: right yeah it was 

158.53 160.66 A: oh i know exactly 

160.01 161.05 B: yeah 

160.86 171.48 A: and to me for them to get upset with each other too is kind of like ludicrous because they know going into that what they're putting themselves into i mean it's not like they're thinking this person's only dating me 

171.44 172.50 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

171.57 180.89 A: they know he's dating like thirty other women so why would you go into that and then get into these cat fights with these other women [mn] you know 

174.33 175.41 B: i know 

178.99 193.79 B: well it's kind of interesting 'cause with the bachelor i didn't i've never watched the bachelor but from what i hear there was all this cat fighting but then i watched i did watch the bachelorette for some reason i was into watching the bachelorette but not the bachelor and 

183.35 184.13 A: uh-huh 

191.14 193.22 A: yeah i did too mhm 

194.31 203.50 B: the guys were all like hey man good luck to you [laughter] you know they were much more understanding than the women [laughter] 

196.44 198.88 A: (( [mn] pick me yeah [mn] [laughter] )) 

199.03 199.94 A: yeah 

200.41 201.64 A: yeah 

201.71 202.86 A: yeah 

203.57 215.10 B: so it is interesting to see the differences between men and women but it's it's such a goofy thing it's so goo- i don't know why people want to watch it so much either i i don't know why people like it 

207.09 208.07 A: right 

209.45 211.15 A: it is yeah 

214.68 215.73 A: yeah 

215.26 217.88 B: um i did watch the first survivor 

217.55 218.35 A: (( ahah )) 

217.92 222.42 B: but i thought that's all they needed i've never watched another one because i'm like 

219.67 220.72 A: yeah 

221.54 222.45 A: (( yeah )) 

222.60 225.41 B: why do i want to watch it over and over again um 

224.68 225.82 A: right 

226.09 236.86 A: yeah ah i i've watched there was a celebrity type of i don't know if you've caught that one or not [mn] um it was sort of like a survivor i think program i'm not sure what the name of it was 

235.90 242.50 B: oh was it that goofy one i'm a celebrity get me outta here and the title turned me off so i didn't watch it [laughter] 

238.59 240.28 A: yeah yes yes yes 

241.51 253.60 A: yeah i've watched like maybe two or three of the shows um just because i thought it was funny some of the things they were asking them to do that that they were like freaking out about [mn] i mean i thought that was kind of funny 

244.25 245.49 B: yeah 

250.72 252.01 B: oh yeah 

253.49 254.31 B: yeah 

253.64 267.84 A: but you know i just i don't know i think it's kind of strange to put yourself in a position i wouldn't want to do that honestly i wouldn't want to go to some far off place and be kind of secluded and have to deal with bugs [laughter] 

266.50 275.29 B: i know my daughter goes mom you should sign up for that i'm like are you trying to get rid of me [mn] yeah i'm like i could never do that [laughter] 

270.67 272.58 A: [laughter] 

273.61 279.54 A: yeah that that's exactly what i was saying like no i don't think so [laughter] 

278.20 292.84 B: yeah i don't know but for a chance for a million dollars i can see why people have have done it but my god some of the things that they've gone through [mn] like in the first one that girl who got um all those scars on her legs from being bitten by bugs and 

283.35 284.36 A: yeah 

286.47 287.66 A: i know 

292.17 293.15 A: right 

292.94 293.96 B: um 

293.23 294.17 A: right 

294.62 298.26 B: other one you know losing all that weight because they're starving 

297.86 298.76 A: right 

298.35 299.52 B: out there 

298.93 299.95 A: right 

299.53 300.78 B: (( yeah )) 

300.18 303.10 A: is is fear factor considered one of those 

302.67 308.71 B: oh it is i've never watched it i- i've seen commercials for it and i think i would be too grossed out to watch it 

303.35 304.20 A: it is 

305.88 306.84 A: yeah 

308.12 312.12 A: now that one i probably watch more than the rest of them to be honest with you 

311.48 313.22 B: do you watch it yeah 

312.53 320.02 A: well when i when i am around and it's on but i mean i don't make a point of having to be home for it or something [mn] but um 

317.63 319.91 B: yeah i've never seen it 

319.99 334.70 A: i- it's pretty i don't know it's pretty out there i mean it well it was funny because at one point they had four couples on and two of the couples were just dating but they had been dating for like two or three years or something and then they had two couples that were married 

323.35 324.25 B: yeah 

327.71 328.59 B: yeah 

334.09 335.13 B: yeah 

334.70 337.24 A: did you notice did you happen to catch that one at all 

336.31 338.22 B: no no i've never seen it 

337.88 348.51 A: okay well they put 'em in this like the the girls were put into this encased plastic like box that they put in the water completely submerging it in the water and the men 

344.93 345.78 B: (( oh )) 

348.35 353.56 A: um had a key and they were locked in there with padlocks three padlocks and the men had to jump in 

353.67 363.96 A: [mn] swim to the box and open it and let 'em out and then they had to catch grab this flag and whoever got it fastest i guess was like the winners and two of the couples would go on 

362.81 365.59 B: oh my god i c- i could never do that 

364.96 374.48 A: well what was so funny about it was that you know the ones that were dating are like oh yeah we can handle this we're gonna do this you know kinda thing and both of the ones that were dating the men 

374.46 387.71 A: f- once they got into the water it freaked 'em out and they had the women had to be let out from the other side because the men couldn't get 'em out whereas the the dat- the one the ones that were married actually trusted their 

387.59 393.01 A: spouse enough that they did go down and get 'em out and i thought that was so funny because 

392.12 393.69 B: wow 

393.28 397.84 A: a- and to me it just says a lot about being married and you know 

395.35 399.12 B: i guess i would trust that my husband would get me yeah 

398.51 412.63 A: yeah well that's why with me i'm thinking well you know if you're just dating somebody and you haven't made a commitment to me there's still that thing there that you're not committed fully to each other and i think that show really proved that and i thought that was just so interesting 

407.83 408.87 B: right 

412.21 416.63 B: that is very interesting no i hadn't heard anything about that either 

413.97 414.95 A: yeah 

416.27 417.31 A: yeah 

417.78 421.31 A: but um so that was a good episode of fear factor i thought 

421.01 422.01 B: yeah 

421.38 425.07 A: but um there are some really yeah really gross ones [laughter] 

424.55 436.23 B: and ah oh have you seen the the latest one what was it there's a girl she's dating all these gu- mr personality that's it um there's a girl she's picking the guys um 

431.13 433.02 A: oh i haven't seen that one at all 

436.32 438.34 B: without seeing what they look like 

437.96 438.89 A: uh-huh 

438.43 441.88 B: they have to wear this thing over their head like 

441.23 442.10 A: uh-huh 

441.96 443.61 B: and um 

444.80 449.66 B: [mn] one guy let her have it she dumped this you know she had to say goodbye to like four of 'em 

449.32 450.15 A: (( ahah )) 

449.70 455.32 B: and this one guy let her have it he took off his mask and he goes oh you're going to regret this 

454.88 456.49 A: [laughter] 

455.88 460.63 B: oh my god he was so rude i thought what was he expecting out of this 

457.68 458.87 A: yeah 

460.06 466.58 A: right i mean you put yourself in that position so what else can you expect like you said i mean 

460.87 462.33 B: [laughter] 

465.66 475.16 B: i know it well how about that what was her name um marla was that her name the one that from who wants to marry a millionaire 

476.75 478.88 A: ah i'm not sure which one you mean 

478.77 479.81 B: um 

479.93 485.25 B: well she got chosen and they were supposed to get they they did get married right there at the end of the show 

484.99 485.82 A: uh-huh 

485.46 488.35 B: and then she didn't um want him 

488.66 495.03 B: any more she had a boyfriend and she really didn't want to be married to him so i couldn't figure out why she went on the show to begin with 

494.49 497.02 A: right yeah 

495.15 502.71 B: and it turned out the guy wasn't even really a millionaire i mean he had a lot of money but he had kind of exaggerated his assets and stuff 

502.33 503.33 A: yeah 

502.92 504.01 B: yeah 

504.54 507.52 B: so that was kind of a fiasco 

507.91 519.82 A: what about um i'm not sure if these shows are the ones that are considered reality based either but what about the ones where they have couples or not couples but people that go into a house and ah s- they have to stay there for like eight weeks 

518.46 520.94 B: yeah that's considered like big brother 

520.99 523.69 A: i i think that's what it is i'm thinking of 

522.11 527.07 B: yeah yeah that's considered reality too that was kind of fun to watch 

524.90 531.06 A: yeah yeah that was probably pretty neat i kind of thought those were kind of neat you know 

530.45 531.82 B: yeah 

531.33 544.32 A: except that i thought a lot of those is when i watched them i thought some of the couples on there of course well i'm a christian so i mean i look at things maybe different than you would [laughter] but to me to be in that kind of environment and then just let yourself 

539.68 540.66 B: yeah 

544.30 552.15 A: become active with other people when you're not married [mn] is just i don't know it's kind of weird i mean and kind of set up these kind of like 

552.36 559.56 A: you know prob- you know there's gonna be a problem if you're dating or not really dating i guess 'cause you're living there but you know what i'm saying i mean 

559.00 565.74 B: oh something could happen with one of the other contestants where you stop liking each other and stuff yeah yeah [laughter] 

560.70 574.98 A: yeah yeah right that was kind of a strange situation but yeah i mean [mn] that was a neat show as far as i i remember i can't remember everybody that was on it but i thought there was one who had amy on it 

574.88 580.02 A: a blonde girl and a black guy marcus or something you remember that one 

575.86 576.89 B: yeah 

577.65 582.14 B: oh yeah yeah marcus was like one of the girls [laughter] 

580.68 586.14 A: yeah yeah that was funny i liked that one yeah 

583.12 595.19 B: it was good yeah because it's interesting to see the different personalities and how they conflict and who gets along with who and who's lying to who so they can win the game and yeah 

590.22 591.44 A: right 

593.37 594.53 A: i know 

595.19 599.90 B: i could never do it i don't think i could play the game well enough to be so 

596.36 597.81 A: oh i couldn't
