11.98 19.52 A: okay this is reality t._v. boy i don't watch reality tv [laughter] i don't think i've watched reality t._v. in a long time 

14.93 15.79 B: yeah 

19.80 23.24 B: oh that's probably the smart way to do things [laughter] 

22.52 28.04 A: yeah my my husband watches the history channel most of the time and i just sit there and watch that with him 

28.02 29.03 B: yeah 

28.20 31.11 A: do do you watch re- reality t._v. at all 

30.78 39.42 B: i can't say i watch it i can say that when there's nothing on else on i have it on [laughter] so i'm ve- i'm trying to remember the name of the show 

35.54 36.72 A: okay 

39.65 42.63 B: the uh bachelor the bachelor i've had on 

42.92 44.23 A: oh okay

45.52 48.60 B: it's ridiculous it sounds like a ridiculous idea to me though 

49.12 57.04 A: yeah i i never watched that um i'm trying to think if there's ever been a time when i've watched re- reality t._v. um 

58.40 67.25 A: [lipsmack] you know i've watched the um american idol for the last probably eight weeks i'm not sure if that's reality t._v. or not 

66.86 71.63 B: i guess it is 'cause it's like the the making of people [laughter] 

68.17 69.40 A: well i'm sure 

69.52 70.20 A: (( [mn] )) 

71.26 79.40 A: yeah it was it was really the [mn] the people that have been on that show [mn] the singers have been ab- absolutely fabulous for over the last eight weeks 

79.54 80.65 B: yeah 

80.53 92.17 A: so that's something that i enjoy doing watching uh young people perform and seeing how things turn out and watching them uh uh get better and better every week 

92.37 99.76 B: yeah that's true it's cool to see that although that's uh i haven't watched it very much but that simon guy is just too nasty 

94.99 95.89 A: yeah 

100.14 103.57 A: [laughter] oh you mean simon [laughter] 

101.14 101.97 B: (( [laughter] )) 

102.44 103.85 B: yeah 

103.59 116.74 A: yeah simon can sometimes be a little rough on them but uh he was he's been pretty good lately because the ki- all the pe- young people that are singing right now are all good so he's um he's been a lot nicer to them [laughter] 

112.17 113.22 B: yeah 

115.71 117.30 B: (( [laughter] that's cool )) 

117.30 122.23 A: they only have i think uh four four three or four left that are singing 

121.97 123.15 B: oh really 

122.93 123.86 A: yeah 

123.89 128.89 B: after is that [mn] the because the last time i saw it there was a marine was the one who was on 

128.98 130.45 A: yeah he's still on 

130.02 131.19 B: he's still on 

130.97 132.42 A: yeah and reuben 

132.40 135.02 B: reuben right reuben's the heavy guy right 

133.44 134.85 A: reuben's on 

135.16 140.26 A: uh uh yeah he's the really heavy guy with a wonderful voice and then clay is still on 

138.62 139.40 B: yeah 

140.75 142.23 A: and uh 

140.87 142.57 B: i don't know who clay is [lipsmack] 

142.30 147.50 A: oh i can't remember the other one other girl that had a fabulous voice is on 

147.77 150.99 A: and those those four will be performing next week 

151.43 152.36 B: oh cool 

151.71 161.96 A: but that's i think that's the only really reality show that i watch in the mornings i watch little house on the prairie [laughter] [laughter] that's not that's not much of reality t._v. 

158.11 159.56 B: [sigh] [laughter] oh okay 

161.32 162.68 B: no [sigh] 

162.03 164.33 A: i'm trying to think in the past 

162.99 171.74 B: i i wonder if things like trauma um life in the o._r. maternity ward those things [laughter] i wonder if those count 

170.06 171.35 A: yeah they could 

171.48 176.10 A: yeah those could uh probably be considered and even um [lipsmack] um 

176.34 187.08 A: the x. files i don't know if there's that's reality but cops and uh trauma and e._r. those are all probably reality t._v. too and i have occasion i have occasionally watched them 

180.11 180.98 B: yeah 

184.36 185.34 B: yeah 

187.06 188.21 B: yeah the 

187.39 188.45 A: and 

188.29 198.19 B: i watched some of them i i spent some time in new orleans in the hospitals there so i i love watching the like the charity trauma or the 

198.53 202.66 B: or the uh maternity ward over at university hospital 

202.52 204.54 A: right right 

203.15 206.26 B: [laughter] it's like hey i know where they are now [laughter] 

205.91 210.20 A: yes and those shows actually those shows are really good 

207.19 208.01 B: (( [cough] )) 

210.38 211.36 B: yeah 

210.60 220.70 A: um i i like those shows i think that they uh offer a lot to the public uh they're not crazy shows some of the reality shows i understand are pretty crazy 

218.24 219.12 B: yeah 

220.55 222.67 B: yeah i think 

221.55 223.34 A: and i'm just not into that 

222.77 225.14 B: yeah i think most of the new ones like 

225.20 231.87 B: like the survivor survivor i've only seen part of like the first one when they sat down and ate rats 

229.68 230.80 A: yeah 

232.29 233.34 B: i mean 

234.05 236.42 B: i don't know what the sense in that is 

236.51 237.13 B: (( [sigh] )) 

236.61 241.11 A: i think that i watched [mn] one time and i thought this is ridiculous [laughter] 

240.20 241.39 B: yeah 

241.38 249.03 A: [laughter] these people are putting their lives in danger just to to be on this show i i don't i didn't like it at all 

247.05 248.05 B: yeah 

249.55 259.88 B: and then and the one like i said the the bachelor i've seen a bit of that that's the one that comes on when there's nothing else on that i like and it's consistently been that way 

259.95 264.98 B: so it's usually playing in the background while i do something else but 

260.19 261.23 A: really 

264.13 277.78 A: well we ha- we have um uh a dish so we have satellite so we have so many channels to choose from that i don't normally go to any of those reality channels there so much there's so much good stuff on you know 

274.48 276.44 B: [laughter] that's true 

277.60 284.84 B: yeah i have uh i just have cable so i have some more but i like comedy and stuff that i don't have to pay too much attention to 

284.87 286.21 A: right 

285.13 297.78 B: but that sit- that that one sits well in the background but it's really heartbreaking to see you know these are really people who really think they're gonna find love and a lot of that i think you know i don't know there are too many broken hearts there 

297.79 300.63 A: i would imagine there would be i've never seen that show 

299.89 307.54 B: yeah oh what happens is that they all come in and they all there are twenty five girls who come in and like i think eleven are kicked off on the first show 

307.62 310.31 B: and then after that they're um 

310.54 317.29 B: [lipsmack] slowly but surely weeded out and as you're getting to the lower numbers they're all completely falling in love with the guy 

317.33 324.75 B: or vice versa when they had the bachelorette the last two and were like falling both in love with the girl 

317.40 318.60 A: mhm 

325.15 332.32 B: and you know you put yourself out that far because it might be marriage but on the other hand you know 

325.21 327.13 A: oh boy it 

331.62 333.59 A: might be heartbreak [laughter] 

332.70 338.18 B: exactly but that one still makes more sense to me than this one um [lipsmack] 

334.34 335.24 A: yeah 

338.24 340.14 B: married by america 

340.35 342.52 A: i i've never seen that either 

341.93 348.48 B: i've seen just a bit of that one once and what it is is they have just i think it starts off with a bunch of people 

348.66 350.12 B: and 

350.41 354.79 B: friends and family say which of those people they think would be good for 

355.08 357.50 B: the their friend or family member 

357.41 358.46 A: mhm 

357.81 363.93 B: and then the three last people get up and america votes basically 

364.50 369.76 B: which is [mn] ludicrous like without without knowing anyone or anything 

366.55 368.49 A: yeah [laughter] 

370.14 371.27 B: they hear what 

370.18 375.26 A: america doesn't america doesn't always vote right let me know let me tell ya [laughter] 

373.97 375.84 B: (( a- absolutely )) 

375.57 378.14 A: they make some pretty bad mistakes 

376.63 377.60 B: (( you know )) 

378.25 381.67 B: and it's one thing to make a mistake like on um um [lipsmack] 

383.25 386.32 B: on uh what's it called what were you saying you watch 

386.06 387.89 A: (( [noise] um )) 

387.31 388.94 B: over the last eight weeks 

389.22 390.97 A: oh oh the american idol 

390.55 399.48 B: oh american idol it's one thing to make a mistake like that and then you know [lipsmack] worse comes to worse they the kids are going to have to find another producer or something 

399.36 406.14 A: yes and almost every one of those [mn] young people that are left on that show right now will all probably become stars 

405.70 406.88 B: right 

406.70 408.52 A: because somebody's gonna want them 

408.14 418.17 B: exactly and it's another thing when you get married by america and like they're they're [mn] this is marriage you know we're not talking about buying a 

412.42 413.39 A: yeah 

418.35 421.96 B: uh [mn] not even buying a million dollar house we're talking about like a 

422.15 423.85 B: sacred matrimony 

424.17 435.07 A: yeah i know and i would not want somebody in ame- you know people in america to match me with my husband [laughter] [laughter] i would i would much rather uh do that matching myself 

425.01 425.94 B: [laughter] 

430.22 433.37 B: (( [cough] [laughter] [cough] )) 

434.70 436.01 B: exactly 

436.01 436.99 A: so 

437.45 438.52 B: it's very 

437.71 447.84 A: but you know as far as reality [sigh] t._v. i just i'm just not into it so i guess i'm not a very good candidate for this call tonight since i don't ever watch it 

443.43 444.32 B: yeah 

447.13 451.05 B: that's same here but we're making pretty good time so far i think 

448.12 449.04 A: [laughter] 

451.12 453.82 A: how many minutes have we been talking [laughter] 

451.35 452.21 B: [laughter] 

452.81 455.03 B: hold on one second i'll look at my phone 

455.30 461.35 B: nine minutes and fifty three seconds oh no since i called so it's uh about two minutes less than that 

457.19 458.35 A: oh we've only got 

458.77 459.50 A: (( [mn] )) 

460.72 462.74 A: yeah about a couple of minutes yeah 

462.13 464.13 B: yeah so 

462.75 465.41 A: (( okay um [mn] the )) 

464.30 472.34 B: but there was just i don't if it was an ad or i just my t._v. is on silent right now but there's something about the bachelor just showed up on it 

472.12 473.10 A: what 

473.00 475.72 B: um not the bachelor yes the bachelor 

475.73 479.14 B: i thought it it almost seemed like they're playing it 

477.02 480.96 A: oh the bachelor yeah i've never see i've never even heard of that program 

481.12 482.16 B: oh it's 

481.31 486.32 A: [laughter] see i'm out of t._v. except for because we have satellite i get so many channels that 

483.89 484.47 B: (( [mn] )) 

485.68 488.55 B: yeah [laughter] why bother watching the plain things 

488.31 489.38 A: yeah 

489.13 493.03 B: what other oh the other one fear factor have you ever seen or heard of 

493.29 502.61 A: what is it fear fact- oh yeah i think that is ridiculous i watched it one night with my [mn] one daughter who really likes it and i went you are kidding you like this [laughter] 

493.84 495.31 B: fear factor 

500.12 501.36 B: [laughter] 

501.52 507.46 B: yeah i mean some of the stunts are pretty cool but then like eating this lousy stuff 

504.97 505.84 A: i only 

507.37 509.53 A: oh [laughter] 

508.29 513.78 B: that's just like because they they make sure they're safe that's why i don't mind the stunts 

513.80 514.81 A: yeah 

514.12 516.45 B: they have all these safeties in place 

516.59 518.46 A: that's good that's good 

517.23 519.85 B: but like you know eating 

520.32 533.54 B: what was it the the ones i watched they had to ox text- testicles it's like exactly but i heard from someone that they claim that these are delicacies everything that they make them eat is a delicacy somewhere 

524.73 527.17 A: oh yuk [laughter] 

527.57 528.57 A: [laughter] 

533.82 540.16 A: oh [laughter] yeah there probably is somewhere a delicacy but not in this country [laughter] 

534.83 535.76 B: but 

537.10 538.14 B: yeah 

538.62 541.34 B: exactly for a good v- very good reason 

541.70 542.88 A: [laughter] 

542.23 548.12 B: but that at least at least that one's safe like [lipsmack] of all of them that one's the safest one 

548.13 555.33 A: yeah because survivor i don't think was real safe i think that the people could've gotten hurt very easily on that program 

549.09 549.90 B: (( [mn] )) 

551.31 552.64 B: yeah 

553.60 554.38 B: they 

554.49 562.38 B: they had someone get hurt they i think they had someone get hurt i don't remember what happened but i think it had to do with water 

556.28 557.20 A: did they 

562.68 571.59 B: i think he was either either he something happened in the water or right outside of the water and they had to fly it it was made did they have one in australia 

562.91 563.84 A: oh 

572.87 577.30 A: i think i think i remember watching the one with the water and he almost drowned 

577.09 580.75 B: maybe that and then they had to fly him to mainland or something 

580.24 583.95 A: yeah yeah he was he was in real trouble 

581.40 582.37 B: yeah 

583.85 585.68 B: yeah so that's like 

584.63 586.02 A: he was in real trouble 

587.02 591.03 B: i think i think most of these shows are unsafe on one level or another 

587.38 588.11 A: (( oh )) 

591.50 599.89 A: yeah and i don't i i am not into um radio i mean television shows that put people's lives in jeopardy 

592.28 592.87 B: (( [cough] )) 

599.40 599.95 B: (( exact ))
