482.60 483.55 B: (( oh yeah )) 

485.36 487.36 B: [laughter] 

486.27 492.80 A: it doesn't make me want to overeat the same with drinking you know after one glass of something that's enough [mn]

512.14 514.33 B: [laughter] 

514.59 517.23 B: that's always a good thing [mn] so 

516.57 519.37 A: yeah i don't know all my friends can 

518.06 519.60 B: you don't get like killed 

519.94 530.97 A: yeah all my friends can drink more but [mn] and i won't i won't drink and drive that's that's for sure you know i know how that i feel really buzzed with one you know i can't imagine trying to get in the car

531.06 531.62 A: [mn] 

532.65 533.32 B: [mn] 

532.66 538.03 A: yeah it doesn't make any sense so but i don't know why people think they can drive 

537.93 541.54 B: oh my god people think a lot of things they shouldn't [laughter] 

538.65 539.84 A: although i 

540.94 551.62 A: yeah although i have to say that that my ex boyfriend who was an alcoholic he was so used to the alcohol that he could actually drive better than i could with my one drink but [mn] you know 

550.15 553.31 B: oh my god [laughter] 

551.99 558.52 A: [laughter] so either he was like like one of those very functional alcoholics that could um 

558.65 566.90 A: work and everything but he rode his bicycle to school 'cause he did have a dui [mn] i think a lot of people have had d._u._i.s you know but 

563.50 564.37 B: uh-huh 

565.99 569.26 B: oh yeah it's so common to drink and drive these days 

569.27 578.17 A: yeah [mn] but but you know you only have to just dr- just have one drink eat food with it and wait and hour you know then you're okay but [mn] 

577.33 579.64 B: or just walk to the bar you know 

579.26 582.77 A: yeah yeah i don't i don't really understand 

583.00 595.14 A: why people keep drinking you know just to up the time to the time they're gonna leave and [mn] stuff but maybe 'cause it's a habit because they have more than one and they lose their judgment i don't know [mn] 

594.50 595.70 B: yeah 

595.36 599.89 A: but i don't get it and i don't get the overeating 'cause you know like i said i stop
