59.67 70.97 B: and so you can even say whatever you want against them and it won't bother me at all but um i you know i'm embarrassed to admit it but since um since this is a survey about it i'll be honest um 

64.00 65.71 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] [noise] )) 

71.04 79.49 B: i generally watch every reality show that i can get my hands on i started with i i started watching the real world when it first came out and then

78.56 79.82 A: oh really 

79.56 89.11 B: yeah and then um i quit watching the real world to watch survivor and big brother i watched every single night of big brother that it was on

105.04 114.95 A: uh i'm there's some of them like i really didn't like uh the like date your daughter shows you know what's what was that i watched a couple of those but they didn't really work for me 

110.74 113.18 B: [laughter] yeah that's right 

114.60 115.41 B: yeah 

114.73 126.17 A: um [laughter] i i don't watch the real w- i watched the first survivor and i was really into it and i was on the web all the time and i was shocked that rich w- won 

123.10 124.23 B: right 

125.66 127.25 B: [laughter] 

126.29 139.91 A: and then i tried to watch the most recent survivor that was men against women and then like i- i've been i've been taking a class at night now so it didn't it didn't work but i also really like the channel thirteen shows uh frontier house 

134.03 134.97 B: mhm 

139.72 142.00 A: and the manor house that's on now 

141.61 144.19 B: the manor house actually i don't think i know that one 

144.07 149.17 A: it's uh w- well i guess it's channel thirteen here in new york but it's t._b._s. you know public television 

147.20 148.16 B: oh 

148.85 149.97 B: oh okay 

149.05 163.79 A: um and so the manor house is it's a ho- it's it's like a it's in england and it's a it's like they're pretending they're at the turn of the century and there's some volunteers that are the servants in the house and there's some volunteers that are the family in the house 

154.16 155.00 B: mhm 

163.37 164.47 B: i see 

164.17 166.29 A: it's been tense and um 

165.37 169.93 B: i i don't think that's out here yet or i i mean i'm in los angeles 

167.51 168.63 A: (( where are you )) 

169.75 172.37 A: (( oh that's funny the guy i talked to yesterday was in l._a. )) 

172.30 176.09 B: oh really and the guy that i spoke to the other day was in new york so 

172.46 173.05 A: (( mhm )) 

175.49 176.79 A: how funny 

176.18 179.74 B: maybe they want both points of view i guess from new york and l._a. 

179.88 185.03 B: but um well yeah i'm not familiar with that one but um i'll keep my eyes peeled 

185.41 186.42 B: um 

185.45 187.18 A: (( i'm going to be like ten minutes )) 

187.81 188.75 B: i'm sorry 

187.83 190.70 A: [noise] oh okay [noise] sorry i was talking to someone else 

190.36 191.31 B: (( oh okay )) 

191.22 192.29 A: [laughter] 

191.41 192.36 B: um 

192.42 194.99 B: so well let's see so we w- [mn] 

193.54 205.92 A: so well like [mn] although yes i think that it is a guilty pleasure because although i watch them like i think who would subject themselves to being [noise] on this show like and i you know 

202.84 204.21 B: right 

206.12 211.90 A: and i i feel like it's sort of [noise] um like i i see that people 

211.95 223.52 A: w- who are in relationships with each other like me and my husband for instance [laughter] sit on the couch and watch other people living their lives like it's this weird disconnect thing that i ha- 

215.44 216.87 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

223.35 230.48 A: think happens in society i mean i'm totally guilty of that myself but i can't help but thinking of like how 

230.53 236.78 A: it's it's weird like it's it's weird and seems not good [laughter] 

235.55 247.26 B: well you know actually i don't think it's so bad i studied a lot of psychology in in college and i've been kind of obsessed with that ever since and i think that this is a wonderful way to learn about people um 

243.46 244.85 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

247.07 256.53 B: unfortunately these people are put in certain situations so it's not an accurate portrayal of people in their everyday lives because of course these people are being filmed all day 

254.36 255.51 A: yeah 

255.69 256.53 A: (( [noise] )) 

256.55 261.73 B: but it's like having um you know watching people under a microscope 

261.65 276.28 B: and certainly with big brother you get to watch them twenty four hours a day if you if you subscribe online you can watch them twenty four hours a day it's really interesting to see how humans interact in certain si- situations and you can compare and contrast your own behavior 

276.06 285.98 B: and modify your own behavior accordingly if you don't like that way that somebody presents themselves in a situation you get to see that in a way 

286.41 296.72 B: that i- i- where you y- you are able to have an objective opinion of it um instead of being involved in the situation yourself and so you can 

295.94 297.34 A: mhm 

297.00 300.25 B: take that information out and apply it to your life i think 

299.71 301.15 A: well i see your point 

300.99 314.63 A: i mean i've often especially on big brother i've i think it was the second one that i watched really i thought like i would never make it like i would never make it on the show like this i would just crack up like i couldn't i care too much what people think about me i couldn't 

303.54 304.59 B: mhm 

314.05 315.34 B: right 

314.47 320.46 A: stand the idea of like being voted out like i just i'm not cut out for that but have you ever like 

320.28 331.04 A: so you know what you say is kind of interesting like you can observe people's behavior and possibly modify your own do you think that you've ever like modified your behavior based on something you've seen on a reality t._v. show or like 

330.21 331.04 B: hm 

331.42 333.24 B: that's a good question um 

331.77 343.63 A: i i mean i i don't and oh and before before it also i mean this isn't um [lipsmack] do you watch do you watch anna nicole and the and the osbournes as well of course okay yeah 

341.09 344.20 B: yes [laughter] yeah of course 

343.98 345.64 A: [laughter] 

344.07 344.86 B: um 

344.74 350.04 B: you know i wouldn't say that there was a specific event that happened to me that i can say oh i i 

349.87 359.00 B: a- acted this way because of the reality show but i can say that when i see a character that i don't like on a reality show that i make sure that i never 

358.84 365.28 B: do anything that would remind me of their behavior because i think their behavior is so distasteful or whatever 

361.71 363.58 A: [laughter] 

365.24 379.24 B: so yeah and it does come into my mind every now and then i'll be saying something kinda gossipy or whatever and then i think oh god i sound like lisa or i sound like you know [sigh] and um and so yeah i i kind of keep it in mind 

373.60 375.68 A: [noise] right 

377.43 378.48 A: [noise] 

379.24 381.05 B: i suppose do you 

381.40 383.47 B: have you ever done that [laughter] 

381.45 386.93 A: um i think i think if you no i mean i don't think i've ever changed my behaviour but it's true like if you 

386.88 394.91 A: especially i think fox did this when they had like the reality show i think mr mr personality and joe millionaire it was like this two where they're on like three days in a row 

394.51 395.48 B: mhm 

394.72 406.86 A: so it feels like it really does become part of like the characters become you know people who are part of your consciousness like almost like when you read a book and you get really get involved and the characters are in your head yes i definitely think that um 

404.04 405.28 B: right 

406.90 420.98 A: you know they become almost like peripheral friends like soaps like when i used to watch soap operas when i was in high school and you know like those people are sort of part of my life [laughter] it's sort of it becomes it becomes like that 

412.32 413.31 B: mhm 

415.96 418.40 B: mhm yeah right 

420.78 430.16 B: yeah i think that's one of the reasons why they're so popular is because people do they they find friends in these characters and and it is it's like a real life soap opera 

424.79 426.07 A: [noise] 

428.39 433.76 A: i guess it is it's like a soap opera it's exactly like what dynasty and dallas used to be 

430.36 431.38 B: yeah 

433.15 434.53 B: right but 

433.77 434.60 A: for 

434.76 435.75 A: people 

435.06 447.50 B: [mn] and it's got another level of excitement because you know it's real and so i- you know a lot of people are voyeurs and what you're doing is you're basically watching somebody else's every move and and so that's exciting in its own way 

441.12 441.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

442.57 444.71 A: (( right and )) 

447.62 454.44 B: and these are your captive people you know exactly where they are [laughter] and um you can 

453.68 467.16 A: it is kind of fun to predict 'cause i was watching the first i only saw the first episode of mr personality but i was like oh my god i can't believe that guy said his dad just died three weeks ago or whatever it was it was like she's never going to pick him now and she and she was like 

458.34 459.25 B: mhm 

463.19 463.75 B: (( [mn] )) 

465.15 466.68 B: yeah yeah 

466.95 475.21 A: oh he was so honest and he really opened up to me i thought that was great and i was like what [laughter] it's like it's interesting to see 

471.99 473.18 B: yeah 

475.38 485.79 A: i don't know i find that i really there has never really been a character on any show that i've related to like oh i would be just like her like i just 

485.76 492.05 A: i i watch people say things and i'm like are they serious are they just saying this because they're on t._v. like stuff like 

492.19 498.60 A: oh like the extreme makeover show [laughter] oh my god i watch so much t._v. it's really embarrassing 

494.24 496.90 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

497.42 500.92 B: [laughter] i know i'm embarrassed talking to you about this too 

500.05 510.84 A: [laughter] um like the women get on the extreme makeover show and they're like i'm so proud of myself i'm really doing something to change my life and i'm thinking what are you out of your mind 

501.06 502.38 B: okay yeah 

507.71 508.84 B: right 

510.72 511.89 B: mhm 

510.96 521.92 A: i mean and i think a lot of people i'm not the only one who feels superior when i watch these shows i mean i think that's something else people get out of them as well i guess they feel superior to 

516.88 517.69 B: yes 

521.82 527.44 A: people on t._v. like it's not they're not stars but they're you know still on 

526.43 528.05 B: exactly 

527.91 532.52 B: that's i think that's a really good point and also watching those reality dating shows 

532.31 533.22 B: you 

533.00 547.69 B: yeah i mean i- you're married but i'm not and um you know it it gives me reminders about you know what definitely not to do on a date [laughter] and it also makes me feel better about myself makes me think wow i'm really a catch because i would never act like that 

541.64 544.14 A: (( [laughter] )) 

545.86 549.78 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

547.97 557.83 B: so yeah i think that those are a bunch of reasons why people find them appealing and just also for the laugh factor of just just laughing at these ridiculous people how these people behave 

558.35 559.18 B: so 

558.57 560.05 A: yeah 

559.60 564.13 B: well i think we've covered it but we're supposed to wait 'til they tell us to um 

563.27 566.46 A: i know i i'm surprised it hasn't but this this 

566.51 578.35 A: talk is going much better than yesterday's [laughter] it was i actually lied to the guy about my name [laughter] i got all weird like oh my god what if he finds out who i am and i don't know why 

568.85 571.28 B: really yeah yeah 

577.12 578.61 B: (( [laughter] )) 

578.85 583.70 B: well don't worry i won't i won't come and stalk you or anything [laughter] 

580.11 582.85 A: no no i [laughter] yeah that's okay 

583.04 583.72 A: [laughter] 

583.78 589.99 B: um but uh yeah i let's let's see what else um what else can we talk about 

588.70 592.13 A: so you live in l._a. do you work in the entertainment industry 

591.97 594.60 B: um no i'm an english teacher 

594.67 596.51 A: (( oh wow )) 

595.13 597.39 B: so yeah what do you do 

597.49 599.89 A: um well i actually did ah
