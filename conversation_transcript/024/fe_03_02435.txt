0.70 2.25 B: hello 

2.00 3.20 A: hi 

2.88 4.92 B: yes my name is max 

4.68 7.22 A: max hi my name is mike 

5.24 6.18 B: yes 

7.17 8.12 B: hello 

8.33 10.94 A: so max and mike two ms 

10.36 12.78 B: yeah [laughter] m. and m 

12.84 17.51 A: yep so i m. and ms let's see i think eating candy is worse 

17.49 19.91 B: um what were the choices again 

18.38 19.55 A: [laughter] 

19.65 25.46 A: oh there are about ten choices and i didn't follow them all i think there was over eating 

25.72 28.11 A: uh voting republican 

28.50 30.96 A: uh too much caffeine 

31.45 34.93 A: uh smoking i'm not sure what else 

34.83 37.26 B: um was there one gossiping 

36.86 38.31 A: yeah gossiping 

37.61 40.96 B: yeah i would think that's probably the worst 

43.03 49.44 A: yeah that's pretty bad because you know you can't destroy somebody else's reputation if you're smoking 

48.97 53.70 B: yeah exactly and i don't think the other ones are really that bad i mean 

53.72 66.56 B: they are bad but like like this one i would say is probably much worser than the rest of them cause the other ones are more like worser for your body than this one is more individually 

68.48 75.10 A: yeah you know the only thing wrong with that is that if we both agree we've gotta fill up eight more minutes 

74.91 75.92 B: okay 

75.65 82.68 A: [laughter] so let's think of something worse than gossiping let's see without doing physical harm to anybody i guess 

78.24 79.26 B: okay 

82.60 85.66 B: yeah that sounds okay 

85.78 90.81 A: you know my um teenage daughter is taking a religion class and uh 

90.86 99.50 A: for their assignment they were supposed to not engage in in gossip or idle chitchat for a day 

99.17 100.16 B: uh-huh 

99.51 102.87 A: and it was like impossible for her for her to do 

102.70 103.85 B: wow 

103.57 109.60 A: you know every time she'd say something we'd go oh isn't that gossip or isn't that idle chitchat 

109.31 110.53 B: yeah 

109.81 117.73 A: and uh she got so frustrated by the end of the day that i think she and her friends kind of like gave up on it it was like it was too hard to do 

117.22 118.84 B: no point [laughter] 

119.07 125.88 B: yeah especially in high school like my brothers and i and it's really hard because like everyone does it so it's like 

126.15 131.88 B: like one person can't just decide not to do it cause there's always someone instigating it or something 

131.56 135.33 A: yeah if you didn't gossip you'd have to work 

134.90 136.69 B: yeah [laughter] 

137.86 140.99 A: you know so it's something else to do other that 

140.42 141.73 B: yep 

141.45 150.80 A: so let's see gossip we think is worse let's see what do we have we had over eating uh over drinking taking drugs is that it 

146.75 148.19 B: (( i have to say )) 

150.27 152.18 B: not exercising 

151.50 155.63 A: not exercising well i i missed exercising tonight so 

155.12 156.40 B: [laughter] 

155.78 157.81 A: so i guess i'll live through it 

157.74 158.79 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

158.93 160.21 A: but um 

161.46 162.68 A: uh 

163.52 170.31 A: yeah they i guess i could do active harm or probably worse than like not exercising where 

166.40 167.69 B: yeah 

170.43 176.38 A: you know it's just like you're not you know you're are not making yourself better but you're not necessarily making yourself worse 

172.35 173.33 B: (( yeah )) 

175.99 180.33 B: yeah there the difference is so significant really 

180.07 182.03 A: yeah 

182.04 188.91 B: yeah but other than that also that i'm sure drugs and smoking are bad for your body and lungs 

188.99 190.18 A: (( yep )) 

190.51 193.04 A: and too much caffeine i don't know 

193.35 197.46 A: i did a thirteen hour day today and i don't think without caffeine i would of made it through 

197.10 200.43 B: so caffeine isn't necessarily too bad 

199.94 208.89 A: [laughter] yeah although if you get too much of it you start i you know i start getting the shakes after a while and and you know that's not too good 

205.66 206.73 B: oh 

208.27 210.51 B: yeah that's true you 

212.98 219.67 B: but i heard it gives you like um brown teeth is that true i don't think it is but 

219.36 224.23 A: well yeah coffee and tea you can get teeth stains but mostly on like the inside of your teeth 

223.63 224.60 B: uh-huh 

224.47 229.82 A: and uh you know they don't like really turn brown they're just not as white as they might be 

229.40 230.47 B: oh 

230.50 238.43 A: but you know at fifty three i'm just lucky i've got teeth i'm not too worried about what color they are most of them are gold anyways so 

233.26 236.02 B: (( hm )) 

237.70 241.42 B: [laughter] yeah that's okay that's cool 

243.95 244.74 A: so 

244.83 247.72 B: are there any other choices we're forgetting 

247.34 251.84 A: uh i'm trying to remember what kind of choices there were 

251.87 258.65 A: i think that's about it seem i think they purposely gave us a long list so we could spend two or three minutes just trying to figure out what uh 

258.48 259.76 B: they were 

259.35 260.69 A: what they were 

260.22 263.78 B: yeah then like come up with it ones that are 

261.85 262.88 A: yeah 

263.05 265.55 A: how many calls you been on 

264.93 268.62 B: this is actually my first mm 

266.93 281.75 A: yeah this is my third although they've called a bunch more times but i told them they could call between seven and eleven o'clock and they always call just right a minute or two before eleven p._m. and sometimes i'm just in bed asleep 

281.38 283.54 B: oh did they just call you right now 

283.18 284.53 A: yeah 

283.94 288.06 B: oh cause i don't know i called their number and then they just connected me 

287.88 288.67 A: huh 

288.79 290.51 B: sounds pretty cool i guess 

290.29 292.26 A: yeah but uh 

292.50 299.21 A: so i left them a message to change you know so i wouldn't be called after ten but they don't seem to of read their email yet 

298.55 300.24 B: oh yeah 

299.71 300.84 A: but um 

301.89 304.26 A: i've been up since five i'm just 

303.71 306.26 B: oh damn a long day 

305.02 308.78 A: i was just i was just brushing my teeth heading into bed 

308.20 310.58 B: [laughter] and they just called you out of no where 

310.43 311.71 A: yeah 

311.05 312.11 B: (( damn )) 

312.29 315.93 B: um d- can you do more than three calls 

315.83 320.06 A: i don't know the the material said that you'd be called three times so 

320.27 324.58 A: i don't know whether you do more or not so if it's three then i'll sign off 

324.48 325.52 B: (( uh-huh )) 

324.59 328.97 A: but still haven't quite figured out what this study is really about 

329.00 332.71 B: what what were some of the other questions they asked before 

332.47 336.01 A: well let's see one of them was how many uh 

336.09 340.01 A: you know whether you have a lot of close friends and acquaintances or 

339.77 352.47 A: just a few you know whether you make friends easily and that was the last one i did the first one was two or three weeks ago and i'm trying to remember what w- what that one was 

342.57 343.85 B: mhm 

352.61 359.32 A: but i can't remember what that topic was so i don't think i don't think the study has anything to do with what topic it is 

359.50 362.09 A: they may actually be um 

363.23 367.62 A: you know they ask about what type of phone you're on so may be it's like 

367.80 370.14 A: whether whether 

370.62 379.73 A: it's a lot harder for people to talk or like one person or or both people are on cell phones or something that might be it 

379.13 382.25 B: mhm well i'm on a regular phone i guess 

382.00 386.81 A: yeah i'm on and i'm on a portable although most of the time i'm on a regular phone 

386.73 387.80 B: oh 

388.02 397.25 A: but the other night i was with some woman from washington who was on a cell phone and she was fading in and out at at 

398.13 399.41 B: reception 

399.28 400.51 A: yeah 

400.06 404.61 B: oh how would that go if you got like disconnected or something 

400.97 401.99 A: so 

404.06 411.69 A: well you know you can get disconnected it's just like you know i'd hear like the first part of the sentence and then wouldn't hear the rest of it 

411.09 412.36 B: oh 

412.52 413.38 A: (( you know )) 

413.68 414.88 A: but um 

415.70 419.21 A: so maybe we'll find out and maybe we won't know what it's really about 

418.69 420.23 B: (( yeah )) 

419.63 421.48 A: so where where are you from 

420.87 424.01 B: i am from um los angeles actually

426.69 431.67 B: [laughter] um more than i need [laughter] i don't know 

431.87 433.76 B: probably a few 

435.75 437.30 B: three to four 

436.92 438.16 A: three to four 

437.76 440.19 B: yeah where are you from

448.83 450.62 B: only football 

449.17 450.43 A: (( cause uh )) 

450.62 464.57 A: you know the the hawks are out of the they didn't make it into the play off and hockey the bulls didn't make it into the play off and you know baseball you know the cubs and the white sox didn't start off good and then and then 

455.03 455.94 B: yeah 

464.31 466.59 B: (( yeah )) 

464.79 467.53 A: fade out so there is nothing really going on 

467.71 469.38 A: how about yourself 

469.03 479.43 B: well i am a i am a huge clipper fan that's my team but i'm always a lakers fan i always got to cheer for them especially if they keep winning 

477.58 478.74 A: yeah 

479.49 480.41 A: (( oh )) 

480.29 482.42 B: coby's just too great 

482.11 485.76 A: well i always l- i always like when he was in chicago 

485.36 488.42 B: yeah he was pretty he was doing it for the clippers 

488.38 489.46 A: yeah 

488.79 491.89 B: i hope they sign him to like a long contract 

491.44 495.30 A: yeah cause he always seemed like the kind of guy who you know he could play for 

495.43 500.32 A: fifteen years and he'd still be pulling down rebounds and he seems like a nice guy 

499.93 502.30 B: yeah he's solid build 

505.73 515.65 B: hm but athletics we don't really have a football team and the baseball teams i guess they're good like the angels world series and the ducks have been on fire lately 

512.46 513.63 A: yeah 

516.36 517.79 A: that's right 

517.15 519.70 B: playing right now but it's zero zero 

521.29 523.65 A: (( so do they have a second round yet )) 

522.84 525.67 B: yeah they're playing dallas second round 

525.89 526.68 A: (( oh )) 

527.93 531.65 A: it still seems like an odd name for a hockey team the ducks 

530.42 532.98 B: yeah the mighty ducks it's 

532.64 534.00 A: yeah 

533.40 536.95 B: sort of like a t._v. movie name 

537.44 538.98 B: but [laughter] their 

539.04 541.19 B: uniforms are pretty nice 

542.06 544.04 A: yeah 

543.51 550.81 B: but it's also a disney company like the angels and ducks so i guess that's why they picked those names really 

550.93 552.94 A: (( yeah let's )) 

554.06 559.34 A: see what other sports teams they could buy their name after disney characters 

558.49 560.56 B: mickey mouse [laughter] 

560.37 561.52 A: [laughter] 

563.40 565.39 A: yeah 

566.68 570.43 A: so let's see maybe we should gossip about people that would make sense wouldn't it 

569.80 571.22 B: we should 

571.28 575.09 A: yeah i'm trying to think if i know any good gossip about anybody 

579.03 582.62 A: nothing about coby and his new bride or anything like that 

581.21 585.79 B: hmm [laughter] shaq's been the player lately 

586.15 588.87 A: oh that's right shaq got married didn't he 

588.40 590.48 B: oh yeah he did 

590.56 592.61 B: he had a kid recently too 

593.19 594.96 A: yeah 

595.29 598.63 A: well you know when you're that big i guess you work fast 

598.10 599.83 B: (( yeah you have to ))
