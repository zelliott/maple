50.83 57.38 A: yeah i watched some of that especially not it wasn't this this current season maybe it was the past season 

57.43 59.98 A: ah i guess it was because we had the 

60.79 65.65 A: sixty some odd year old school teacher from ah right outside tampa 

65.05 66.60 B: (( ahah mhm )) 

66.04 70.12 A: and she was on there until almost the bitter end she was kind of interesting to

80.57 84.73 B: easy it's easy stuff to watch all this reality t._v. 

84.87 87.58 B: programs but [mn] i think 

86.52 92.01 A: [mn] they seem to be running out of ah anything that's even remotely interesting any more 

90.73 91.53 B: yeah 

92.07 104.19 B: yeah [laughter] yeah yeah i i and and they seem to be dumbing down and making things trashier as it as it goes o- as it goes on its on on its cycle 

92.69 93.25 A: (( [mn] )) 

103.89 114.02 A: ah i didn't i didn't watch it but i think i believe it was fox network that has stooped to the ultimate low and had monica lewinsky as the moderator of one of their [mn] 

111.13 112.41 B: right right 

113.10 114.85 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

114.17 116.66 A: reality shows come on [laughter] yeah 

115.84 125.42 B: yes ah um the woman's picking ah her suitor and the suitors are all wearing masks so it's called mr personality yeah 

122.72 123.73 A: that's it 

124.79 126.20 A: yeah [laughter] 

125.53 132.60 B: yeah i think um something just started on ch- on t._b._s. though manor house it's called 

132.77 141.24 B: and they ta- they're taking modern people and placing them in um servants' positions like in a victorian 

141.09 149.03 B: household ah you know upscale victorian household so they're having like they're chamber maids people becoming chamber maids and [mn] 

148.83 157.76 B: and um um first houseboy and hall monitor boy and [mn] the 

156.61 160.06 A: i've heard about that one i've seen it advertised 

159.48 160.54 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

160.19 163.99 A: ah but t._b._s. had something like that a few years ago 

164.30 165.60 A: (( is that where they ah )) 

165.66 172.57 A: attempted to get a modern family to live like a pioneer family in montana or some you know some western state 

168.62 170.01 B: yeah exactly 

171.80 179.28 B: yeah i yeah i saw some of that too that was that was that was sort of interesting and this manor house just started 

179.25 191.43 B: on monday it it might have been just a three night show monday tuesday wednesday might have been all of it um i'm not sure i i remember something having to do with three nights but i only was home on monday so 

184.80 185.75 A: mhm 

191.53 196.11 B: um but it was it was very interesting you know th- there's a lot of things that [mn] 

196.05 207.38 B: that ah you learn from from that type of show you know i- in fact you learn how the house- households were structured and how the [mn] the various um 

207.38 219.61 B: um responsibilities of the various servants ah how they in- both intertwined and stayed separate as well and you know the things that they used to have to do like 

219.69 220.94 B: (( [mn] um [mn] )) 

220.97 224.94 B: you know its its education and it's of course that's what you 

225.54 227.88 B: know th- they put it on p._b._s. for 

228.66 234.96 B: [lipsmack] but these reality shows they're [mn] they're kind of there's a lot of cheesiness and they're just going to get cheesier too 

234.84 244.68 A: well you know i think what it is is that in comparison to a let's say a regular show with regular actors in a regular studio 

244.72 247.11 A: they're probably much cheaper to produce 

246.60 248.14 B: (( yeah )) 

248.40 258.37 A: and ah you know and they fill up the time slot that the advertisers like you know th- that bring in the under fort- you know the eighteen to forty nine year olds or whatever the 

253.71 254.70 B: yeah 

257.82 259.48 B: yeah yeah 

258.38 262.97 A: the key thing is for advertisers what they where they perceive the most money is [laughter] 

262.76 265.06 B: yeah [mn] true 

265.77 276.00 B: [mn] i've i've always i've always liked the um the non fiction t._v. anyway i mean i remember back in the day of um the the loud family and the the 

276.34 281.55 B: ah p._b._s. and american family the family they left in was loud 

282.59 284.54 A: i remember that vaguely 

283.90 286.43 B: yeah that was like back in the seventies 

286.55 293.81 B: [mn] and ah even the real world on m._t._v. you know as of starting about ten years ago so 

293.87 299.51 B: even sixty minutes and twenty twenty that that's my type of ah television so [mn] 

300.58 303.29 B: um yeah no laugh tracks and stuff just [mn]

488.15 489.46 B: and um 

489.55 491.83 B: [mn] yeah it's a nice [mn] 

490.65 497.84 A: well i guess well i guess we should go back to the topic and just you know my opinion is i guess they're they're here to stay but they're on the wane 

497.90 499.59 B: (( yeah mm )) 

499.57 502.58 A: you know i think you'll see survivor survive and you know 

502.68 505.53 A: maybe the bachelor or something like that but ah 

505.62 520.47 B: mm [mn] there's a lot of passion to it though there's it's it's still it's still very popular and i i know that a lot of people are very addicted to it um [mn] and ah i i know even for myself in a couple of years of survivor [mn] 

520.47 527.57 B: towards the end of the survivor season i've definitely started to watch it when the when the ranks 

527.60 535.46 B: get smaller and it be- you can start to focus on who's there a little more you can really enjoy the second half of a season 

535.85 537.70 A: yeah that's true there's no 

536.72 537.28 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

539.44 544.30 A: ah you know there's no way you've really missed anything even if you tuned in on the last day so you 

543.34 553.26 B: yeah yeah [laughter] well you know you do you do miss something you do l- like survivor you know there are there's a lot of dynamics um [mn] 

553.14 559.87 B: that ah that ah that you you would miss if you just tuned in on the last show 

559.84 569.22 B: but in the beginning they don't know each other so it's really it's like [mn] it's like the beginning of a party where everybody's just feeing each other out and then 

569.05 582.24 B: [mn] someone leaves the party early and they were insignificant but after they leave after the well into the season there's a significant loss but [mn] if you miss the first couple of shows where the first [mn] 

582.12 587.68 B: twenty or twenty five percent of the contestants are leaving then they they're pretty extraneous 

587.71 595.70 A: [laughter] i just wish i i knew what ah demonic hold they have over these contestants that they don't disclose what they know 

595.71 599.89 A: you know [laughter] because that that show is over be- months before we watch it 

596.25 597.59 B: oh yeah
