13.67 14.60 A: indeed 

15.12 22.18 B: i kind of like them all to be honest with you i watch american idol who wants to marry a millionaire 

17.65 18.49 A: really 

22.27 25.67 B: i've become kind of addicted to them how about yourself 

25.01 36.44 A: oh that's good so you uh you'll be able to tell me something i don't have a t._v. so [laughter] i've i've actually b- been going over to my neighbors to watch american idol 'cause they they have a little little party every every time but 

29.51 30.45 B: (( you don't have a )) 

36.49 37.51 B: oh really 

36.66 40.07 A: i don't know does that count is it reality i mean i don't know 

39.73 45.09 B: i well i would think so i mean you know it's a reality to them right 

41.55 44.01 A: [laughter] i mean they're they're singing 

44.35 46.70 A: yeah i guess so they're they're singing 

46.56 53.12 B: yeah so that that's pretty cool i remember when survivor first came out and it was like this big [sigh] 

47.57 48.52 A: (( i don't know )) 

52.63 53.46 A: yeah 

53.66 55.04 B: (( you know new )) 

55.10 59.07 B: s- thing but n- now it's kind of ridiculous how they have so many um 

59.32 63.49 B: [lipsmack] like that show oh married by america have you seen that [laughter] 

61.79 70.31 A: oh yeah yeah no actually i haven't but where it it's like the the audience picks the couple or something like that or 

69.64 79.99 B: right yeah they pick who is going who's supposed to get married and they propose on stage without even seeing the other partner [laughter] i thought that was pretty crazy 

76.67 78.25 A: [laughter] 

78.83 83.36 A: good plan that sounds like a basis for a really sound relationship [laughter] 

82.33 84.10 B: [laughter] yeah right 

83.57 84.82 A: [laughter] 

84.14 88.87 B: yeah how well could you get to know somebody in a couple of weeks or months anyway 

87.51 89.92 A: (( [laughter] i don't know [mn] )) 

89.28 96.17 B: [laughter] i mean i haven't found somebody in person so i can't imagine like a couple of weeks uh 

92.77 94.19 A: (( [laughter] )) 

96.12 99.61 A: yeah i think that's probably not the way well i don't know though they have all these 

99.43 113.66 A: you know i think it's like [noise] like they have this game show and i mean it's not reality t._v. or anything they have this game show in argentina where if you win you get a job [laughter] like they don't give you money or anything 'cause the employment's so bad you get like a good paying job you know 

108.88 110.61 B: oh really [laughter] 

113.52 114.58 B: [laughter] 

113.91 119.75 A: uh i mean [lipsmack] i think this you know this might be an avenue open to you if you're looking for someone 

120.05 123.16 B: yeah right i you know now that you mention it it 

120.11 121.62 A: (( [laughter] )) 

121.90 122.89 A: i know 

123.17 125.19 B: may be so like um [lipsmack] 

125.35 131.51 B: you know how people do personals and over the internet i guess maybe it isn't much different from that 

128.71 129.56 A: mhm 

130.90 132.60 A: (( yeah i guess i don't know )) 

132.37 133.10 B: (( huh )) 

132.87 139.97 A: i'm i'm like uh w- what i'm wondering is when the the i think the next phase is going to be 

140.01 146.74 A: r- reality television shows they're not reality any more they're like supposed to be reality but they're all staged you know 

146.51 147.77 B: yeah well 

146.98 159.66 A: i was just reading about something like this some like internet thing some internet site i don't even remember what it was it was like but they were like it was supposed to be this like real thing and and they documented all this i think it was like blair witch project you know 

159.19 160.52 B: right right 

159.69 162.77 A: but it was like it was actually like you know it was made up so 

162.28 172.54 B: yeah well i mean it is hard it's hard to know if it is it is all you know just for show or i mean you know they they they want to make money they want to have viewers so 

168.58 169.35 A: yeah 

172.89 175.72 B: and you know some people will do anything to make a buck 

174.67 177.79 A: well i mean yeah like american idol it's like i mean 

177.92 182.54 A: it's all so i i don't know it's so weird it's like so artificial you know it's like 

182.96 192.46 A: l- like they're not like actually being selected by like people for their singing quality it's like just this ring and call and vote thing 

192.42 196.13 B: yeah well in the beginning they are when they're screened 

193.62 194.42 A: (( i don't know )) 

194.89 198.66 A: but it works too i mean that girl that won last year is like a superstar 

198.14 199.16 B: i know 

199.00 200.02 A: [laughter] 

199.41 211.69 B: but i you know i was thinking about that too now with this the second phase that's you know coming up and everything how many times can they do this before people are like oh right another american idol singer you know 

204.99 205.99 A: yeah 

209.39 211.64 A: right right totally 

211.79 215.37 B: what you know how how many shows can they do i'm surprised that 

215.51 221.96 B: like survivor has lasted so many seasons and fear factor which has become disgusting factor 

217.87 218.87 A: yeah 

220.00 222.98 A: (( yeah fear factor i saw once that was yeah that was kind of fun )) 

222.20 233.01 B: [laughter] but that's becoming sort of your fears it's become like an eating gro- you know gross eating contest of [laughter] you know well i don't know it's strange 

228.36 229.88 A: [laughter] 

232.09 233.74 A: [laughter] it's pretty silly 

233.60 234.95 B: pretty strange 

235.08 243.71 A: i wonder where all this has i think i think like cops you know must be the original reality t._v. show or something i mean probably there were things even before that but 

240.86 242.35 B: see that i like 

244.21 246.22 B: i liked that 

244.25 245.42 A: (( or you know )) 

245.59 249.09 A: like kind of or american gladiator you know that was like 

248.50 249.90 B: oh yeah 

249.29 259.46 A: they had like r- i mean it was definitely all artificially set up but they had like ordinary athletes competing against these sort of steroid pumped up superstars and 

258.81 259.81 B: right 

259.87 260.80 A: (( yeah so )) 

259.92 265.59 B: yeah well yeah i wonder and game shows and all that i guess it all had to come from somewhere 

264.25 265.13 A: [sigh] 

265.45 266.33 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

266.12 270.49 B: but i think with shows like that they tended to really use people that 

270.58 283.21 B: were your average people i mean for shows that are there today th- the screening processes that you have to go through and american idol it's not that you know it's not like i'm up there singing like your average person they're almost a superstar 

272.25 273.05 A: yeah 

280.36 281.45 A: right right 

281.77 285.33 A: yeah they went through sixty thousand people right [laughter] or something like that 

284.22 285.59 B: yeah right 

285.35 290.33 A: (( yeah yeah we we were talking actually i i just watched uh watched this show last night )) 

286.10 287.06 B: and they are 

290.18 302.47 A: and um my girlfriend really liked the girl that got kicked off say oh it sucks you know like it doesn't matter there's five of them left they're all millionaires already they as soon as she walks o- off the stage she's got a record contract you know 

299.21 300.26 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

301.71 303.37 B: [laughter] 

302.57 305.17 A: (( like none of these people are going to have any problems you know )) 

305.28 306.61 B: yeah 

305.99 310.99 A: it's weird though i'm don't [mn] it's such a weird show uh uh did you see the little like ford 

311.25 313.96 A: like advertisement they did in the middle of the show 

313.74 314.75 B: no 

314.37 327.86 A: it was so strange it was like they took like five minutes out of the show with like the ford logo hanging onscreen to like advertise this ford and like all this american idol like contestants were like saying how cool the car was and stuff like that 

327.37 339.31 B: uh no but you know what i did now that you bring it up sure i've seen um [lipsmack] like in the middle of the show where they go off and they were r- riding in some kind of race cars or something like that they're like subliminally uh 

336.63 337.62 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

338.75 343.23 A: yes all this weird promotion i mean it's not that weird it's like or they all like 

343.25 356.54 A: um oh yeah a- a- all of a sudden last night they had they go onto the set of boston public and like they shoot a little mini scene with them as characters in the high school and it was like well of course you know like boston public's like owned by the same network and all that stuff 

356.15 360.04 B: right plus that girl tamyra or tamyra that was on 

359.40 362.84 A: right right she she got she got a role i guess there's a 

360.06 361.32 B: last season 

361.56 363.66 B: she's an actress now 

363.06 366.21 A: legitimate tie in there okay that's real 

364.59 366.53 B: (( [laughter] )) 

366.58 367.90 B: (( [laughter] but )) 

367.06 369.32 A: but anyway so 

368.12 368.99 B: yeah 

369.62 373.15 A: what about what else about real why do you think they're so popular 

373.46 374.87 B: oh boy 

375.10 389.53 B: i think i would have to say they started to become so popular because the people the viewers at home sit there and they watch it and think wow that could be me but it but now you know i mean i thought that when survivor came out 

384.66 386.29 A: [laughter] yeah 

386.61 387.34 A: (( [noise] )) 

387.68 391.46 A: but that's i mean that's like [noise] that's like what what like 

391.88 400.16 A: [noise] i don't know a- television shows uh shows do all the time like why is it more interesting that rather than being this like made up fantasy world like you know like 

400.70 404.08 A: cop shows or like you know i don't know like 

403.43 410.26 B: well i certainly wouldn't want to be on cops but i'd want to be on [laughter] fear factor or survivor or something 

405.48 407.25 A: that's true yeah [laughter] 

408.66 410.27 A: that's true that's true 

410.33 422.87 B: and have the opportunity to win some great prize that you know maybe you wouldn't have otherwise but i think it's gotten to a level where it's not your average person anymore really that's on there so 

422.24 426.46 A: yeah yeah do you do you watch a lot of television i'm just interested 

425.83 426.69 B: um 

426.75 428.38 B: yeah i 

428.55 435.06 B: well i go to school at night a couple a nights a week so i spend a lot of my time studying but when 

431.79 432.66 A: okay 

435.30 447.94 B: when i'm off like i i try not to miss american idol the first season i didn't miss any nights i was totally addicted to that one clare kelly clar- clarkson won at the end i was crying [laughter] oh yeah [laughter] 

441.95 442.86 A: yeah 

445.00 446.38 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

446.95 448.66 A: but did you want her to win or 

448.44 450.92 B: i did i did i was crying out of joy 

449.19 450.49 A: that's good okay 

450.65 451.80 A: yeah 

451.04 457.06 B: which i- thank goodness this is like an anonymous call because i would never admit that to anybody else 

453.66 455.15 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

455.17 457.67 A: [laughter] no worries 

457.27 458.72 B: (( [laughter] )) 

458.76 460.62 B: [laughter] so 

459.95 468.71 A: i i i broke down reading email spam today so i was like yeah [laughter] just sort of got caught off balance uh yeah 

464.56 466.76 B: [laughter] all right 

468.10 470.23 B: you can relate [laughter] yeah 

469.24 474.82 A: yeah totally it happens [sigh] yeah well that's cool i don't know i i mean 

472.51 473.29 B: hm 

474.84 485.93 A: yeah i i'm like pretty i'm not not totally regretting not having a t._v. i don't i don't miss it that much but i i spend many hours a day surfing the web so i guess 

485.66 491.02 B: right so you when you watch the shows you watch them over at your friend's house oh 

490.03 498.77 A: yeah yeah i mean they've kind of made a thing of it they make a big bowl of tex mex and we all you know issue witty commentary on this and that and [sigh] 

498.40 501.19 B: right ah that's that's neat though that you could 

500.06 507.67 A: yeah it's a social event more than a you know like a veg out event but uh [sigh] i get my vegging too so i don't know 

503.86 504.74 B: right 

507.16 508.27 B: hm right right 

508.42 513.92 A: i don't know i think i think the whole thing's a just i remember first hearing about you know survivor and all of those 

512.82 513.68 B: mhm 

513.96 520.76 A: and thinking it was like the coolest thing and then by the time like it came out and there was in you know within a month or two there were another couple of shows 

520.93 528.64 A: ah it just seems like it's part of the landscape now it'll probably just fade into being another television genre i think i don't know 

528.60 538.89 B: right but then you know people are just going to keep trying to beat that show and beat that show i mean i wonder what does it have to come to public execution or something 

533.03 533.87 A: yeah 

534.95 536.69 A: extreme like [laughter] 

537.44 546.37 A: yeah exactly how are they going to ratchet it up one more i think jackass is kind like that i i didn't see it but the reality movie there's this thing like 

540.16 541.12 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

546.29 547.86 B: yeah 

546.88 557.90 A: these people doing incredibly stupid things and capturing it on film i was also reading about this thing which is like totally terrible i i and i didn't totally get it but it was like 

558.19 570.70 A: like basically these these kind of punk kids are travelling around uh new york city and like pick fights with bums or like get bums to fight each other and then like tape it and like sell this as a like video 

570.37 574.75 B: but they they [laughter] boston public did a show on that 

570.75 572.66 A: totally alarming 

574.13 576.41 A: oh really boston public did 

574.77 575.57 B: (( yeah )) 

576.30 578.23 B: boston public yeah how the 

577.46 579.12 A: oh that's funny [laughter] 

578.27 581.83 B: the kids were um going out and and taping that 

581.42 583.41 A: oh 'cause that's like a real thing 

582.97 590.93 B: yeah yeah well they've i think they base a lot of their s- their um ideas on actual events that happened but 

583.98 585.06 A: yeah 

588.60 591.11 A: it's like law and order or something kinda [sigh] 

591.08 592.28 B: that's um 

592.50 598.86 B: ah that's pretty horrifying but you know it's even more horrifying that they do it because there's an audience for it 

594.06 595.06 A: yeah 

598.24 599.89 A: (( yeah totally they're like )) 

599.29 599.95 B: there's
