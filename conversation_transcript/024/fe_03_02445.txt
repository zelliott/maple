2.09 3.36 B: i'm kath 

3.89 4.96 A: who are you 

4.67 5.93 B: my name is kath 

5.90 7.58 A: hi kath how are you 

7.30 8.38 B: (( good how are you )) 

7.98 9.55 A: i'm fine thanks 

10.12 14.28 A: [mn] so the question i guess is d- do we watch reality t._v. 

13.79 15.13 B: (( right um )) 

14.34 15.39 A: (( do you )) 

15.24 16.93 B: i don't 

16.58 27.14 A: i do [laughter] [cough] i don't watch all of 'em but i have watched some of the reality t._v. shows before [mn] any particular reason why you don't 

17.35 18.38 B: okay 

26.63 30.67 B: um i don't know i'm just not really interested but what makes you wanna watch them 

30.39 31.92 A: [mn] um 

32.50 43.50 A: [mn] just because i c- find them interesting and o- oftentimes i actually find them irritating and i don't know if that means i enjoy being irritated or [mn] or what or maybe i'm just nosey i don't know 

43.08 47.99 B: do you think it's because you're able to relate to the people on the show more because they're real characters 

47.82 49.14 A: um 

49.66 56.10 A: [mn] that's qui- that's a possibility although like i i watched um [lipsmack] joe millionaire 

56.46 68.12 A: and ah i couldn't relate with the women at all because i f- i thought they were phoney and i couldn't see how anybody could convince themselves that they were in love with a man that they'd only known for like twenty four hours 

64.34 65.22 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

67.52 69.15 B: (( mm that's true yeah )) 

68.36 80.25 A: [mn] you know so but i haven't watched i watched survivor only maybe once or twice it was a little bit too intense [mn] for me i didn't find it ah fun i i don't like to watch the ones that 

80.31 83.85 A: where people are like miserable and unhappy 

84.00 89.97 A: i've w- i watched the bachelor um i watch american idol i guess that's considered reality t._v. 

89.99 95.14 B: is that the one where they pick people to perform and try and find a pop star thing 

94.78 95.88 A: yeah 

95.32 96.19 B: okay 

95.94 105.05 A: [lipsmack] yeah i've watched i'm um this is the second time that i've watched that i've watched i watched that from start to finish last last year and i i i've enjoyed it a lot this year a 

105.12 106.95 A: lot of talent on there 

106.48 110.65 B: yeah one of my sons watch it ah do people actually make big breaks with that show 

110.49 122.83 A: yes absolutely there there was a woman named tamyra gray that was on last year who i think should have won the contest but was voted off towards the end and [mn] she's got a guest appearance on one of the 

123.06 129.52 A: weekly t._v. shows that i haven't watched i think it's boston public or one of those she she c- she's on there 

129.02 129.58 B: (( mm )) 

129.47 143.10 A: and a couple of them have made a movie together and they've got recording contracts and so yeah [mn] i think that [lipsmack] they get a lot of exposure you know [lipsmack] just by being on the show on american idol itself so 

138.01 139.00 B: yeah 

142.82 152.56 B: yeah when i think about that show i um i think of that guy with blond hair was he on that show the curly blond hair and he looked like somebody from n._s._y._n._c. or something 

152.42 154.73 A: um justin 

154.84 160.19 B: i i don't even know his name but whenever they had advertising for that show that's what i saw on it 

159.56 165.38 A: oh you know who that was i think it was ah probably the like the master of ceremonies a young guy 

165.02 166.31 B: oh yeah 

165.71 180.03 A: yeah that's that that yeah that yeah he does have blond hair and i've never really [mn] i don't know n._s._y._n._c. that well but i could see where he could be he could look like he would be in a group like that yeah yeah that that's that's who that is then evidently 

176.08 177.36 B: right 

179.53 181.07 B: is he the one who won 

181.44 187.35 A: no no i think who you were seeing was not a singer were you seeing him singing or just seeing him on stage 

187.34 188.74 B: he was on stage 

188.13 192.16 A: yeah i think he's just the m._c. for the show right 

190.06 191.99 B: oh okay right 

192.67 195.25 A: [lipsmack] so [mn] 

195.93 203.86 A: [laughter] let's see what other w since you don't watch reality t._v. let's see what other ones have i seen a a couple of years ago there was a show called um 

204.07 206.18 A: temptation island 

205.62 206.80 B: hm i've never heard of 

206.75 209.92 A: [laughter] that was [mn] 

208.46 217.43 B: that oh yeah wasn't that when two couples ah or two p- members of a couple went and tried to see if their partner would cheat on them or 

216.82 218.11 A: yes 

217.90 220.58 A: and that was very it was very irritating too 

220.49 221.07 A: [mn] 

221.02 231.35 A: it was [laughter] it was very irritating and i used to watch it with my daughter and we both would gripe and complain all the way through it and then we'd be the first ones to be tuning in the following week 

230.31 232.28 B: (( something [laughter] )) 

231.30 237.46 A: [laughter] but it was just kind it it was kind of evil it really was [laughter] 

236.39 239.49 B: did people usually end up cheating on their partners 

238.81 247.86 A: oh some of them did and and again why would you if you were a couple why would you put yourself through an experience like that why would you know i mean 

245.61 247.20 B: exactly 

247.30 250.01 B: you'd have to be pretty insecure about your relationship 

249.39 256.95 A: yeah or or way too secure one or the other but either way i just don't see how you could come out of it with a healthier relationship 

256.12 257.84 B: yeah exactly 

257.25 266.64 A: you know but it it was fun watching but it was irritating it [mn] so i- in answer to your question as to whether or not i relate i don't actually think i do relate 

266.69 268.15 A: i think it's just 

268.29 276.08 A: i just look at it as as fun you know and ah like i would never even consider going on one of those shows [mn] 

270.19 271.08 B: (( mhm right )) 

275.31 280.84 B: yeah i wonder if people just do it for the money or th- whether they're driven by the topic of the show 

281.49 285.71 A: i think i think a lot of it is just the opportunity to be on television 

285.12 286.25 B: (( you know right )) 

285.75 286.94 A: i really do 

286.64 288.93 B: yeah 'cause then the entire country knows you 

288.65 289.86 A: exactly 

289.02 290.61 B: it's like instant fame 

290.07 291.89 A: mhm exactly 

291.92 302.10 A: [mn] and i guess they they do become some of these shows do become very popular i know they've got websites on on the internet and i know there's a lot of talk rooms and stuff ah chatrooms where 

302.26 305.73 A: people some of the people that watch these shows are 

306.15 313.00 A: [lipsmack] i remember when big brother was on a couple of years ago i went into one of those chat rooms once just to see what the people were talking about and 

313.03 323.00 A: you could watch the the people in the home on big brother on the internet and some of those people were literally tuned into the internet twenty four hours a day it was kind of scary 

320.53 321.82 B: (( ahah ahah oh my god it )) 

322.52 324.30 B: becomes like an obsession 

323.65 331.73 A: exactly it was kind of creepy to think that somebody was so obsessed with what was going on in that house that they were literally [mn] glued to the 

329.79 330.83 B: yeah 

331.83 335.82 A: internet just to see what those other people were doing twenty four seven so 

335.12 336.45 B: yeah 

335.94 338.06 A: yeah it's kind of it's kind of scary 

337.65 342.73 B: i think the first reality t- t._v. show was the one on um m._t._v. the real world 

343.17 344.52 B: do you remember that show 

344.29 345.90 A: actually i do 

345.51 346.88 B: yeah 

346.33 348.65 A: there was one in l._a. i think 

347.90 351.18 B: yeah and they all shared like a huge house and just 

351.34 352.98 B: the camera followed them around all 

351.40 355.99 A: yeah i saw a few episodes of that because one of my kids used to watch it 

355.32 356.71 B: yeah 

356.08 363.76 A: and ah yeah i do remember that and ah you're right that is like the first i think [mn] big brother was very much like that 

363.24 373.59 B: mm yeah and then just recently there was this huge resurgence of um and a bunch of them came out ah it was i think survivor was the one that sort of sparked all of them yeah 

364.24 365.36 A: mhm 

373.38 376.50 A: absolutely it was survivor i know that 

375.62 380.33 B: i i haven't watched that show even once but i heard so much about it 

380.71 384.04 A: i watched it once and i didn't like it it was too 

383.07 384.71 B: 'cause it was too intense 

384.42 385.44 A: pardon me 

385.01 386.34 B: too intense 

385.68 396.34 A: it was those things they wanted them to do and it was just it was too much i just it made me uncomfortable some of the things the physical things that they put them through um it ju- it bothered me 

395.77 396.80 B: yeah 

396.21 400.78 A: it was they were not having any kind of a good time and so therefore neither was i. 

400.57 402.30 B: what was the point of the game hm 

402.51 409.20 A: [lipsmack] ah whoever could go through the hardships and was the last one to remain i guess in the location wherever they were 

409.56 411.60 A: (( won i think )) 

411.86 422.36 A: i'm not sure how much they won but i think it was like a million dollars or something yeah it was a lot of money [mn] plus they got like you were saying instant fame 'cause i know they go on david letterman 

414.54 415.73 B: oh my goodness 

421.77 423.21 B: right exactly 

422.42 427.96 A: and and they're the big topic of conversation on jay leno and a lot of the talk shows and 

427.26 428.60 B: yeah 

428.04 435.93 A: [lipsmack] so but i don't know i was surprised that survivor is still around i think they're in their like their fifth year now or something it's just location i don't know 

433.67 434.85 B: (( yeah oh my )) 

436.02 439.30 A: [lipsmack] [lipsmack] but that one i don't watch [laughter] [mn] 

437.64 438.59 B: (( goodness )) 

439.93 443.20 A: (( [lipsmack] so ah w- so you've never watched any of 'em )) 

442.81 447.81 B: not really i mean i've seen a couple briefly like the real world one but i'm not 

446.29 447.28 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

448.06 450.62 B: like a regular watcher you know 

449.73 451.08 A: yeah 

451.16 457.83 A: [lipsmack] ah the only one that i really watch faithfully now is american idol i do enjoy that but 

456.68 459.16 B: right because everybody's happy and everyone 

458.47 463.94 A: i and and they're singing [laughter] i like music and i like to to see who's good and who isn't 

459.75 461.09 B: right exactly 

463.05 464.52 B: yeah exactly 

463.96 469.47 A: and like you know who's going to win you you pick a winner and it's kind of like rooting for your favorite football team you know 

468.65 469.51 B: (( right )) 

469.60 474.20 A: [mn] so it's more like a a a contest than anything else and i like that [cough] 

471.68 472.47 B: yeah 

475.11 478.91 A: [lipsmack] because i guess game shows don't fit into the reality category 

478.40 479.48 B: yeah 

479.83 483.43 A: but i'm a big game show watcher so 

483.03 484.57 B: yeah they're kind of similar though 

484.42 488.36 A: yeah in some ways there's a winner [laughter] 

486.34 487.21 B: yeah 

487.29 488.75 B: and they're not actors 

488.56 491.97 A: no and they have to follow the rules [laughter] 

490.61 491.82 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

492.23 493.79 A: (( so i don't i don't know )) 

493.84 495.79 A: [cough] so what do you watch [lipsmack] 

495.33 502.15 B: [mn] um let's see i don't i spend more time on the internet than i do watch t._v. but um 

502.44 504.00 A: i love the internet [lipsmack] 

503.54 510.24 B: yeah it's yeah because it's sort of possibilities whereas t._v. youre limited to what's on but 

509.37 511.36 A: mhm exactly [mn] 

512.50 516.84 A: in fact you wonder how you ever went without the internet or at least i do i 

516.24 517.66 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

517.04 528.78 A: was talking about that with a friend of mine the other day the fact that that it used to be if if you if there was even the name of a song or there was something you couldn't remember and it would drive you crazy you'd lie awake at night trying to figure the answer to something [mn] 

528.71 533.73 A: now you can just go on the internet and in in two seconds you know what the answer to that thing was that was haunting you 

532.61 538.83 B: [mn] right yeah you know it's really weird you know you just have one question whether it's a name you can't remember or anything and 

538.43 550.65 A: you can get it mhm i love it [laughter] [mn] yeah [mn] it is and and when are we supposed to still be talking about reality t._v. i wonder [laughter] [mn] 

538.99 540.33 B: exactly 

540.64 542.46 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

548.59 551.58 B: oh right um how long have we been on for 

551.33 554.80 A: i don't know i don't even know if we're supposed to time it or what 

554.51 558.78 B: yeah i know um i think it said a minimum of eight minutes and 

558.33 560.06 A: see i thought it was ten 

559.54 564.29 B: i'm right they said um it's a ten minute phone call but a minimum of eight minutes or something 

563.80 566.09 A: okay is this your first call 

565.52 567.38 B: yeah i've never called before 

566.85 571.35 A: i haven't either so i don't know if they just cut us off or if 

567.74 568.90 B: oh yeah 

571.20 572.24 B: yeah 

571.67 577.07 A: because they said something about you have a chance to to enter your own comments at the end 

576.48 577.93 B: oh huh 

577.35 578.88 A: where are you by the way 

578.53 580.34 B: oh i'm in massachusetts

583.76 584.93 B: (( yeah )) 

585.98 592.52 A: but um i guess i assume then that we d- did you look at the clock before we when we started 

591.93 596.28 B: um no i don't i didn't register i think it was something like two o'clock though 

596.24 597.88 A: (( mm-kay [mn] )) 

596.91 599.95 B: yeah it was definitely two o'clock when we called
