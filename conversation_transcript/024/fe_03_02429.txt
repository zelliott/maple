140.14 141.79 B: oh that's wonderful 

141.18 154.14 A: it's amazing how much difference walking or swimming or sometimes i ah sometimes i use a treadmill but most often wa- just walking a half hour a day

153.89 155.14 B: mhm 

154.52 155.56 A: makes

199.59 200.62 B: mhm

229.72 230.97 B: and 

231.00 241.76 B: ah i don't gain more weight or lose any weight but it contributed to a weight gain that never varied but but but the walking 

239.54 240.60 A: mhm 

242.02 253.44 B: made me feel healthier it just i've never lost i've never gained it just stayed at one level but the walking made me feel better i just felt so blah and so

413.94 424.04 B: and that helped a lot i have to admit i can't remember all the others but did they say alcohol and that's not a good one either [laughter] 

420.73 421.97 A: (( mhm )) 

423.37 432.58 A: no it's it's i think a lot of those things it's a it's a case of in have any of a- any of it in excess is is bad i can

444.18 452.82 A: the dam- the the damage and how people can behave very badly with with that influence too

453.14 467.49 A: so you have to ah you just have to try to keep it an even keel and i don't know it's probably harder for some people than others pro- some people are probably more more chemically prone to things i don't you know i don't think 

465.20 467.83 B: mhm i believe so too 

467.72 480.20 A: you know i don't think i'm you know necessarily more virtuous than they are or anything it's it's just ah just how things ah how things end up sometimes you have to 

467.97 469.01 B: mhm 

471.72 472.73 B: yeah 

479.24 480.38 B: mhm
