114.05 115.53 A: [laughter] 

123.29 125.03 A: right exactly 

123.66 125.56 B: representing our country 

125.71 127.12 A: exactly

131.32 133.12 B: so uh mm 

133.20 139.16 B: no comment so which other ones are out there you know which one i did like was um there is that uh 

134.01 135.59 A: [laughter] 

139.27 148.41 B: the bachelor one the guy was from around like the mid west area and i watched that one 'cause i really did think them that h- he and that girl would end up together it was so stupid 

148.49 150.54 A: yeah see now i didn't um 

151.22 153.59 A: i don't know the whole dating thing just 

153.87 156.13 A: i i don't like yeah i don't know i 

153.95 155.06 B: (( would yeah )) 

155.20 161.55 B: well right it's bad enough like people dating on their own why you know advertise and 

159.33 160.35 A: yeah 

162.29 163.87 A: i yeah 

162.37 163.13 B: (( i don't know )) 

163.54 164.65 B: (( i i hear ya )) 

164.27 165.37 A: yeah 

164.81 170.66 B: and especially once you get to be like in in your twenties and stuff like in your [mn] when they're rich like that 

170.68 172.45 B: that's almost a mockery 

172.52 174.27 A: well i think so too 

173.91 179.58 B: yeah 'cause you can just walk into it why would you wanna flaunt how much money you've got on t._v. and all that 

179.39 190.93 B: if you you know if you're having problems meeting somebody and stuff maybe you need to get your head out of your butt and you know drive like a cheap car and go out to real places and you'll meet plenty real 

184.82 186.27 A: [laughter] 

190.81 197.25 A: well that's what i yeah and i always wondered it's like okay you have all this money why is it so difficult to meet somebody 

196.32 198.46 B: (( right right you would )) 

197.74 199.78 A: you know what is wrong with you 

198.94 207.33 B: [mn] because i don't know about you but i have a ton of girlfriends they're like looking for a guy that does have a lot of money and it's like you know that's not going to buy you all the answers to your dream but 

203.73 205.42 A: oh absolutely 

207.15 215.03 B: i'm sure they can find somebody like that because y- you know let's be real a lot of these guys that do have a lot of money aren't anything to gawk at 

214.66 215.59 A: right 

215.33 216.64 B: you know so 

215.67 217.34 A: i yeah 

216.75 222.89 B: and it it seems to me there should be [mn] anybody who wants to meet somebody should be able to meet 'em somewhere 

223.38 224.21 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

223.82 226.26 A: i think so i think you know 

226.05 228.41 B: [laughter] where where do you live 

226.83 229.96 A: i mean a wh- i i'm in pennsylvania 

229.35 237.54 B: oh okay so you're up east and yeah i don't know what the ratio is like there i mean i'm in the mid west as i had said earlier and it's you know there's more guys than there are girls 

231.00 232.00 A: yeah 

237.14 239.51 A: oh re- see now that's see i'm just re- 

238.52 241.52 B: opposite up there right yeah 

239.97 243.24 A: yeah see i'm recently divorced and 

241.91 243.90 B: yeah do you have kids 

243.50 245.98 A: um a a tw- twenty year old daughter 

245.49 251.95 B: oh well yeah hey you know this reality stuff you've lived it [laughter] or you are living it huh 

248.73 250.81 A: (( yes [laughter] )) 

251.26 252.66 A: yeah 

252.17 263.82 B: well yeah the i guess you're kind of going through the thing of reality life yeah the dating scene it stinks i mean you know people tell you where you're supposed to go and how you're supposed to meet people and it doesn't work like that 

263.47 265.24 A: no it doesn't 

264.65 273.33 B: and then the ones that you meet at the place y- between you and me if if i were to go again i probably would kind of use one of the dating services 

273.64 282.50 B: i don't you know i i've never well i guess i've known some people that do but why not you know the people are signed up for the thing for the same reason so at least you got a 

280.40 281.33 A: right 

282.57 285.10 B: you know you're starting out with one thing in common 

285.02 288.47 A: yeah well i have a friend that that's how um he met his wife 

287.95 291.23 B: yeah and why you know i i think it's a a great way to start 

290.79 291.97 A: yeah 

291.36 303.93 B: you know if y- the matching up thing with um your friends and somebody knows somebody yeah that's fine and dandy but d- i i wouldn't expect a love connection from it no just going out and getting out of the house and having fun that's that's cool 

299.44 300.29 A: no 

303.24 309.30 A: n- no uh yeah and that's i mean you know and that's what a lot of the reality based t._v. shows are 

307.01 307.89 B: (( yeah )) 

308.68 315.76 B: exactly exactly and and if you look at it like entertainment that's fine but i i kinda get tired of it 

309.56 310.67 A: (( you know )) 

316.27 322.53 B: being all over now when you turn on t._v. you know before it seemed like it was only on a couple of days of the week which was cool 

319.07 319.87 A: yeah 

322.21 323.31 A: right 

322.54 331.06 B: you know you know which days not to turn on the t._v. least they haven't convoluted our thursday nights yet have they [laughter] 

329.22 333.47 A: i don't think so i think survivor is the only one that's on thursday nights now 

332.43 339.57 B: right right and i think people actually that that was like the the fore founder if you will so i think people kinda 

339.59 346.32 B: you know the true fans will stay with that show on the thursday night and then they've got the other stuff on t._v. like the friends and all those 

346.14 347.17 A: yeah 

346.44 350.44 B: things that are real popular so it's not bad yeah 

349.42 354.17 A: so why so why do you think this is so popular i mean why why all of a sudden 

354.55 356.32 B: i i think [sigh] 

356.34 360.13 B: it's new it's different and everybody can relate to it 

360.20 362.24 B: and e- misery loves company 

361.76 363.24 A: yeah 

362.62 365.66 B: and maybe that's what it is misery loves company and 

366.39 372.87 B: and and and like the it's not phony or staged i mean i mean parts of it are obviously but i mean it's just 

373.04 381.83 B: people can relate to different aspects of it be it you know they like laughing at other people making idiots out of themselves because they've done the same thing i guess and 

378.37 379.31 A: right 

380.36 383.65 A: and i think we're all voyeurs deep down in our hearts 

383.04 385.28 B: yeah i know we are right 

383.69 389.48 A: you know we all wanna p- you know have you ever driven past a house where the the lights are on 

389.61 396.40 A: you know and they have like sheer drapes or maybe the curtains are open yeah you you're still kind of like you don't wanna look but 

392.69 395.90 B: yeah yeah yeah 

396.32 402.79 B: well you do though especially yeah especially if it's a house like a a new house or something and you we're we're nosy 

397.03 399.80 A: but you do it's it's human nature 

400.13 401.15 A: yeah 

402.54 403.54 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

403.19 409.01 B: we're nosy and and it's just we like to see that other people a- are other similar to us with that 

409.09 412.67 B: you know i i think we we become more comfortable as 

413.11 415.40 B: as like you know people that are 

415.83 422.55 B: living in this day and age maybe that's part of it too with all the crap going on it's like you know it's a diversion 

422.61 427.65 B: [noise] you you know the wars and the the unexpected this and that and tragedies it's 

424.31 425.47 A: yeah 

427.84 429.74 B: it's kind of lighthearted 

430.10 431.78 B: and there's no to it 

432.37 433.60 B: not really 

433.17 434.03 A: no 

433.82 437.94 B: you know and it's it's much to do about nothing you narrow down who you think 

437.70 448.43 B: you know it's it's almost like voting i guess people like to vote for their favorite and then this kind of draws it out and you know in in the end some of us well we'll pick the right one [laughter] which some of us won't 

446.70 448.11 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

448.19 454.95 B: and you know it doesn't matter 'cause we're gonna get another chance to do it again [laughter] 

451.93 458.25 A: exactly exactly yeah y- yeah i mean you know like if you look at um like american idol 

458.02 459.59 B: yeah yeah 

458.36 465.19 A: um i know several people now i w- i i don't usually watch the whole thing i wait 'til like the end um 

463.14 477.64 B: yeah yeah i but you watch a little bit of it here and there so you just kinda know the ones that you think are good and then it was cool the way you're saying because then if you pick it up like in two or three weeks if you're person's still there you're like hey i'm doing pretty good and then you wanna watch more 

465.60 467.52 A: yeah yeah 

477.10 484.90 A: right right but i mean people i mean i the i uh uh two people come to mind right away they are like obsessed with this show 

477.90 478.93 B: yeah 

484.61 488.65 B: yeah and they have been since the la- since the last go round and all that yeah 

485.26 486.27 A: (( you know )) 

486.71 487.84 A: yeah 

488.29 491.86 A: yeah and i'm like you know it's just a television program 

491.12 492.17 B: right 

492.00 498.57 A: you know when their favorite one gets voted off oh n- oh my god i don't wanna watch it it's like well come on it's just a t._v. show 

492.22 493.22 B: right 

497.90 504.29 B: yeah but you know this that show out of all of them i really do kind of appreciate um purely because 

504.57 510.72 B: talent does get recognized and rewarded on there and you don't have to be the one who wins in order to 

506.19 507.25 A: right 

510.68 518.23 B: have your dream come true [noise] you know so that part of it i think is cool and i can i can see watching that because there's so many talented people on there 

511.79 512.94 A: yeah 

518.16 529.83 B: then again there were a lot that were talented that didn't make the cut yeah so that one's pretty cool i i kinda like watching that periodically th- the songs are great they do you know r- remakes of um 

521.75 522.72 A: yeah 

524.80 526.17 A: i like yeah 

529.84 535.20 B: popular ones that we probably heard when we were growing up yeah some of 'em are are really good 

533.26 534.31 A: yeah 

535.21 541.26 B: so it'll be interesting to to see who does get i haven't even seen it to see who who's left on it has ruben left 

540.89 545.35 A: no he's still on he almo- he was in the bottom two last night and i was like 

541.96 542.79 B: okay 

545.56 550.21 A: um oh my god no [laughter] 

547.51 559.26 B: yeah i'm i'm hoping he gets it and if he doesn't then there's uh you know another person that would be all right to so you know whatever and making it this far right [laughter] same thing we were just saying it's like we pick one of the ones 

555.11 556.37 A: right [mn] 

558.99 560.03 A: yeah 

559.31 561.46 B: is that somebody that's one of your favorites 

561.07 564.89 A: him and um that clay aitken i don't know how but um 

564.31 565.81 B: i- is he the other guy 

565.47 567.89 A: he's yeah very thin and 

567.29 568.93 B: the blond haired guy kinda 

568.41 570.80 A: kind of yeah with like an elfish face 

569.48 571.43 B: yeah i like him too 

571.01 571.98 A: yeah 

571.34 581.26 B: those are the two that i'm i'm with i'm like one's really diversified but the other one's just got a really good raspy voice and you know and and if ruben makes it i think that's just great you know 'cause 

577.06 578.17 A: yeah 

581.11 588.08 B: it's gonna it's gonna prove old what's his face wrong about he's always nailing people about being overweight screw it you know 

586.14 587.46 A: yeah 

588.17 593.55 A: yeah i ju- yeah i mean that's like you know the one show that you know if i am home i will 

588.27 590.08 B: [laughter] 

592.69 599.89 B: right yeah yeah it's like yeah and then maybe they'll come up with something else but i never did do the osbournes 

593.56 596.70 A: make sure that i watch but oh yeah
