1.73 3.03 B: hi 

2.83 4.67 A: i'm virginia a- 

3.79 5.03 B: i'm karen 

5.24 6.84 A: karen i'm calling from 

6.99 8.09 A: (( texas )) 

7.98 10.00 B: oh well i'm in new york city 

9.63 15.46 A: new york city okay ah i'm a former yankee myself but i was born and raised in new york 

10.34 11.34 B: mhm 

15.09 26.66 B: oh my goodness well i'm actually from originally from florida i've but i've been here since college i did not get the last the l- l- the second before last thing before exercising did you hear that 

15.60 17.66 A: [laughter] 

20.86 21.79 A: uh-huh 

26.06 29.93 A: um caffeine smoking drink- alcohol 

30.23 31.81 A: (( ah overeating )) 

31.40 33.62 B: overeating okay that's okay 

32.33 33.24 A: uh-huh 

33.50 37.77 A: yeah and gossiping was one of them yeah so where do 

33.86 34.63 B: (( ah )) 

34.97 39.30 B: and gossiping [laughter] right where would we be without gossiping [laughter] 

38.00 42.90 A: what is to decide which is worse right and what do you think 

40.25 42.50 B: (( which is the worst yeah which is the worst thing )) 

42.90 45.30 B: i think um 

47.47 49.21 B: i guess i have to say smoking 

49.19 50.18 A: smoking 

50.11 53.15 B: although overeating is in there plus smoking i guess yeah 

52.01 54.91 A: mhm ah why do you say smoking 

55.03 60.71 B: because i think it's the the one thing that has been seemingly um 

61.26 69.69 B: a- medical evidence that seems to show that it's harmful for many many people and it's hard to counteract it like if you overeat you can exercise if you 

69.96 82.93 B: don't exercise some people it never bothers i don't like for everything else it seems seemingly like there's you know somewhere that to to counter counteract it um but i don't see any counteraction to tobacco you're just lucky whether you 

78.54 79.87 A: mhm 

83.17 86.16 B: you know whether you ah have the gene that 

86.31 91.78 B: takes it into into stroke cancer heart attack whatever so what do you think [laughter] 

91.22 92.15 A: well 

92.34 106.66 A: i probably will take alcohol but i i agree with you to some extent on smoking because my husband smoked all his life and he had ended up with ah emphysema and then cancer of the lung which he ah he didn't live very long after he was diagnosed with that 

100.35 103.94 B: (( yes oh no [mn] oh )) 

106.81 114.63 A: and ah you know a- and he probably would have lived for um several years if it hadn't been for that 

106.81 108.54 B: (( my goodness that's to bad )) 

114.42 115.35 B: (( mm [mn] )) 

114.91 117.51 A: because it it definitely ruined his lungs 

117.41 118.56 B: yeah 

117.57 119.85 A: and you know you can't replace lungs 

119.40 120.81 B: no no 

119.94 121.95 A: but i also um 

121.97 124.21 A: i i don't l- like alcohol 

124.39 129.45 A: no ah this ah programme didn't say to what extent you know 

124.49 125.21 B: ah 

128.13 131.56 B: no no that is sort of um my guess is 

130.54 142.74 A: so i mean ah alcohol in in small portions you know i mean if they just had like were a light drinker or or maybe just socially once in a while maybe on a weekend or something 

140.04 140.93 B: mhm 

142.75 146.57 A: you know that would be different but what i'm talking about is an alcoholic 

146.34 152.72 B: ah right but they they didn't yeah because my my father was an alcoholic and i certainly have seen the damage that that that does 

150.42 151.25 A: uh-huh 

151.51 153.47 A: i mean they're abusive 

153.33 154.17 B: pardon me 

153.92 155.40 A: they're abusive 

155.73 156.75 B: my father 

155.75 158.48 A: they abuse they abuse their partners 

158.53 163.48 B: ah i say well my father was just he didn't do anything physical he was just sort of um 

162.05 166.39 A: yeah well some are quiet drinkers and and then 

164.92 168.13 B: right well he was l- he was he was verbally abusive 

167.48 176.12 A: yeah but yeah but some are physically abusive yeah and you know it destroys um their marriages 

168.14 169.67 B: which is bad enough 

170.75 172.39 B: yeah that's awful 

172.42 173.48 B: (( ah when )) 

175.53 177.06 B: mhm mhm 

176.20 178.88 A: and it destroys um their health 

178.69 180.68 B: oh absolutely yeah 

179.31 190.60 A: ah i had a brother-in-law that ah drank now he was a pretty happy drinker you know like he didn't really didn't fight or anything but he drank to excess and he had to have his pancreas removed 

189.99 192.33 B: [mn] gee 

190.67 196.36 A: and that made him a diabetic he w- he wouldn't have been a diabetic if he didn't have to have his pancreas out 

196.12 197.37 B: (( oh )) 

196.34 207.39 A: but this made him a diabetic and you know he just went down i mean he would just break out in perspiration even though he took insulin he'd have to be just real careful you know to eat at a certain time 

206.83 208.15 B: mhm 

207.59 208.45 A: so 

208.76 215.06 A: you know a- and then there's alcoholics after they've been alcoholic for so long they have an alcoholic psychosis 

215.31 226.23 A: and you know th- that's really bad too there's so many many things with alcohol i mean smoking y- yeah you know emphysema's real bad and cancer of the lung is terrible 

226.18 227.13 B: (( mm )) 

226.40 234.68 A: and you know when you can't breath that's one of the most important things in life is to breath but it's also ah terrible with alcohol 

228.19 229.72 B: (( oh yeah )) 

230.08 231.46 B: exactly 

231.70 232.99 B: exactly 

234.80 239.92 A: and you know ah drunk drivers if they've been drinking they may kill somebody 

238.72 241.37 B: mhm oh absolutely yeah 

239.94 244.90 A: yeah they might not even mean too you know but they'd be on the road and maybe fall asleep at the wheel 

245.12 250.75 A: and you know kill somebody and then they would have um manslaughter charge on them you know 

246.71 247.82 B: that's true 

248.42 251.08 B: they're hurting other people not just themselves 

250.96 253.31 A: ah there's so many different things um 

253.64 254.74 A: of course now 

254.94 264.31 A: i have a tendency ah to use caffeine i i used to when i was ah younger just drink coffee you know that's how i kept my weight down 

263.88 265.08 B: (( ah )) 

264.49 272.64 A: but i've had to cut it out since i've been older you know but i still like my coffee in the morning a couple of cups you know i can't quite give that up but um 

268.34 270.06 B: [laughter] 

272.67 276.82 A: i am more sedentary than i was when i was younger 

276.52 277.45 B: mhm 

276.85 282.87 A: and so um i guess now i you know i tend to overeat when i get nervous you know 

282.21 286.60 B: oh yeah i know the feeling but how how old are you if you don't mind me asking 

283.45 285.67 A: but um so of course 

285.82 287.08 A: seventy one 

286.61 288.21 B: seventy one i'm sixty 

287.26 290.19 A: and i i gained weight you know [laughter] 

289.30 292.49 B: it's what happens metabol- metabolism slows down 

291.85 306.51 A: right and i gained weight and i'm not as active i used to be active all the time you know but then i worked eight hours on my feet all the time and ah so but you know overeating is real bad you know when you're obese it it's bad for your health too 

292.75 293.62 B: (( right )) 

305.76 307.22 B: mhm 

306.57 313.15 A: but i'm going to pick alcohol and you're going to pick smoking [laughter] and we didn't even touch gossiping did we 

308.46 311.66 B: (( okay i'm going to go with the smoking right [laughter] )) 

312.61 317.20 B: ah well gossiping again 'cause they don't talk about the degrees i know it can sort of be 

317.57 322.69 B: you know it's just kind of a wasteful waste of time and it it it ah 

320.30 322.40 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

322.81 324.64 B: sometimes i think puts 

324.72 328.66 B: road blocks into getting to know somebody because you you hear something about them that you 

328.69 333.92 B: perhaps shouldn't know or it might not even be true and it it colors your 

330.81 331.94 A: right 

333.97 340.51 B: your opinion of them and that's that's really not ah however th- again though everything's not really well defined gossip is really 

335.07 336.11 A: right 

340.81 352.17 B: you know sometimes it's interesting interesting facts and well obviously in new york we have lots of gossip columnists in our newspapers and of course the t._v.s full of them and and some of it's just kind of you know it's just made up just to 

345.76 347.18 A: right 

352.13 359.37 B: sell a record or sell a movie or you know it's just kind of silly stuff but there is very harmful vicious kind of gossip that can be 

355.40 356.81 A: well you know 

358.25 365.06 A: yeah because people sit up and take notice to that and what they want you know is something else they really pick up on that and add to it 

360.67 361.61 B: yeah 

364.36 366.21 B: (( exactly exactly right )) 

365.17 373.43 A: mm there's several things and i don't know what they meant just by smoking whether they meant smoking cigarettes smoking marijuana or what you know 

373.66 377.60 A: but ah there we go again [laughter] marijuana 

375.17 388.29 B: [laughter] well interesting in the alcohol ah really getting back getting back to the alcohol is that um you know like y- y- you've i've heard read some of the studies that indicate wine is and beer have actually 

388.55 390.26 B: (( ah different studies that )) 

390.27 394.36 B: i think it's four ounces of wine a day 

394.66 402.96 B: has been associated with um a le- lessening of heart attacks and something else i i forget what 

399.02 400.03 A: (( mm uh-huh )) 

401.74 405.22 A: well see that's in moderation you know uh-huh 

403.37 411.21 B: ah right exactly exactly especially what i'm think because i don't i don't drink wine every day but i always remem- remember that when i do have wine [laughter] 

409.79 423.96 A: yeah [laughter] i don't drink alcohol i don't drink wine you know but um i i have to go along with you on the wine it does it relaxes 'em and there is some beneficial effect from that but 

419.51 421.05 B: yeah yeah 

422.10 434.22 B: and it's fun that for me to try different wines 'cause the 'cause the taste what they put in it the the different kinds of grapes and the the seasonings and all k- it's really quite remarkable that so many different kinds can come out of it 

428.51 430.85 A: (( ah yeah )) 

432.27 433.63 A: yeah 

433.91 434.78 A: uh-huh 

434.26 435.28 B: but um 

435.61 437.02 B: (( you know ju- ju- we had )) 

436.18 439.47 A: are you do you use caffeine i mean do you drink coffee 

439.09 443.39 B: i i used to drink coffee when i was younger and the last let's say 

443.45 448.32 B: five years it just i kept i'd have coffee i'd say boy they don't make coffee well here 

448.47 459.73 B: and then after a while i realised you know nine times nine out of ten places it must be me and not the coffee makers so i realised it was i just didn't like coffee any more so i switched to tea and once again it's fun discovering different kinds of tea 

458.60 460.61 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] yeah )) 

459.60 465.66 B: and then i've now read that green tea is good for you especially so i'm very happy with mine and and tea is kind of um um 

462.60 463.73 A: (( yeah that )) 

465.81 479.68 B: my ancestors go go back to england and that's that's a kind of a tradit- my grandmother always had tea and stuff and so i maybe it's you know my maybe my genes are [laughter] breaking through like you were meant to drink tea all along so 

468.89 472.14 A: yeah really [laughter] 

475.74 477.12 A: right 

477.30 485.09 A: ah [laughter] i had an aunt that raised me and she lived on tea usually with tea and toast you know but it was the tea that kept her going 

482.81 486.22 B: oh yes exactly exactly 

485.17 489.40 A: yeah she was a little thin lady real prim pert you know [laughter] but 

488.63 493.09 B: well it's picking up in popularity tea is really coming coming on strong and that's 

491.62 504.35 A: yeah they're really suggesting that you either and green tea especially i mean black tea is you know is helpful but i think in any form i i don't think it matters whether you have it in ice tea or hot tea do you 

495.72 496.77 B: yeah 

498.08 499.65 B: it's good but the 

503.36 516.99 B: exactly ah no no it doesn't and the green tea with mint is a is um it makes the the green tea especially palatable for for new new green tea drinkers yeah yeah so there's the you can get you get the combination ah 

505.14 506.02 A: uh-huh 

509.43 511.05 A: oh really uh-huh 

511.52 513.48 A: i bet it does uh-huh 

516.53 524.67 A: yeah there's different kinds of coffee you know but i i just stick to the regular yeah uh-huh and ah 

517.13 518.27 B: green tea with 

521.53 523.01 B: the regular right 

524.88 538.02 A: i don't know i've just never been when i was little and younger i just never really cared even for coke you know it was either water or milk you know something like that and ah now i drink diet coke and ah 

533.64 535.00 B: mhm 

537.07 538.10 B: oh 

538.16 541.78 A: b- but there's caffeine in that too you know [laughter] 

539.16 543.12 B: (( yeah there's a lot of caffeine in that yes [laughter] )) 

541.73 555.44 A: but i drink more of it right now in the summer time you know than i do in the winter i mean i d- in the winter i can let it go you know but of course it doesn't have any calories so that's one thing you don't [laughter] 

551.68 554.58 B: that helps yes yes [laughter] 

555.65 558.10 A: what about ah you as far as eating 

558.45 568.32 B: [mn] ah no i'm an extremely fussy eater i'm a vegetarian so i don't i i r- i always try to ah- mostly fruits and vegetables are what i have so um i'm 

562.15 563.60 A: oh yeah 

567.20 571.30 A: uh-huh you make meat loaf out of your vegetables and like that

586.25 599.89 B: tofu's great it's it's basically it's it's pretty ah it practically has no flavors it's what you add to it so it's like when you have stir fries you add those nice ah sauces to it you know the the ginger kind of sauce and whatnot are it's it's pretty 

591.85 592.77 A: uh-huh 

595.65 596.55 A: uh-huh
