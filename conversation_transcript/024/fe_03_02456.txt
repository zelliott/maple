48.04 48.90 A: yes 

51.91 56.54 A: i didn't see the first part of it you know the very first episode 

54.14 55.10 B: (( ahah )) 

56.01 56.98 B: (( right )) 

57.19 65.28 A: but i um i caught some of the ending once and then i was out of town so i didn't even see all of that but every chance i get i would try to um 

65.68 74.72 A: see you know on good morning america they'd have the next day what happened [laughter] [laughter] yeah [mn] i was catching up anyway 

68.88 71.76 B: oh yeah yeah there you go 

71.95 73.25 B: yeah 

74.79 84.76 B: i always ha- i always had to tape it 'cause i couldn't stand the suspense of the commercials so i would purposely tape it so i could fast forward through all the commercials 

75.00 75.88 A: so 

78.52 82.07 A: yes [laughter] 

84.80 85.47 B: [laughter] 

84.95 89.83 A: exactly i love that that's great well now what hooked you on that 

89.20 90.62 B: [mn] um 

91.27 102.74 B: i don't know i guess maybe i was i i kind of thought to myself that something you know like ten years ago i could see m- i could see myself doing something like that 

102.30 107.31 A: (( i know i could too is that just awful [laughter] )) 

104.89 109.05 B: yeah and and i thought and and so i just kind of put my place 

108.96 118.05 B: myself in their place and just thought that i think that's why i was so into it because it's almost like i was feeling what they were feeling i was 

110.93 112.30 A: (( mhm )) 

117.88 132.47 B: i was feeling the disappointment and the elation and the the tension and the and i thought you know what would i have done in that situation i was like totally i i was totally putting myself in that scenario 

131.82 140.28 A: exactly and i i think too that i thought you know when you first apply for this or audition for it or send in whatever it is they ask you to do 

139.87 140.80 B: (( ahah )) 

140.39 143.66 A: i think your first thing is is hey i can handle this 

143.36 144.48 B: right 

143.92 155.14 A: you know i- whether you're a guy or whether you're a girl or whatever you're you're thinking to yourself no no i got it i know how this show works i'm not going to be disappointed i'm not gonna do this and i- i'm able to pick from all those girls and i 

153.67 155.15 B: [laughter] 

155.17 158.95 A: [mn] and i think that it changes when you're in that situation 

158.85 163.07 B: yeah but i think that too from what the contestants say and 

160.81 170.31 A: yeah it starts definitely to get more serious so but you know i worry in both joe millionaire and the bachelor and the bachelorette 

170.34 174.05 A: i worry in my mind whether or not it becomes such a 

174.20 182.06 A: a competition that you have to win you have to be the one or your your self worth is kinda messed up you know 

180.71 191.61 B: yeah but that's what i was thinking too and w- that's one of the reasons i like joe millionaire is because [mn] to me it seemed like zora was just being herself the whole time 

189.05 189.82 A: (( ahah )) 

191.18 192.81 A: yes yeah 

191.68 195.79 B: that she didn't let what other people were doing 

195.97 197.09 B: um 

197.32 202.95 B: make her act a certain way and i thought that's like to me that's like 

199.56 200.87 A: exactly 

202.98 205.24 B: total self confidence 

204.92 210.65 A: yeah yeah definitely because you you know you've got that camera on and and it's easy to become somebody you're not 

205.73 206.81 B: you know 

209.89 218.29 B: right and and like like um the one girl melissa she started feeling the pressure and just kinda made a fool of herself at the end 

210.82 212.43 A: [laughter] 

217.32 219.16 A: (( yep yeah )) 

218.15 231.74 B: even though he was really into her w- well she didn't know that you know like we knew it but you know and it's like just to to watch people you know try to change their behavior or start feeling the pressure and start acting [mn] you know different 

221.53 222.38 A: (( yes )) 

231.70 237.37 B: and and then i thought it was interesting too [mn] and and then it ma- it just makes me wonder 

237.53 243.55 B: how real it actually is because i thought that that guy what was his name nevin or d- 

239.53 240.49 A: (( ahah )) 

243.62 253.17 B: what was his name again [laughter] i can't remember [laughter] but the guy the joe millionaire guy i thought he was such a um 

245.30 249.32 A: ah i i don't i didn't see all of it so i don't remember yeah 

250.05 251.44 A: yeah 

253.91 259.06 B: [lipsmack] he was such a guy i mean you know he he was so into how they looked 

259.13 260.93 A: yeah 

259.28 267.34 B: you know he was so into their looks but then like with the one girl that sarah girl who i never liked her um 

261.56 262.96 A: yeah he was 

266.50 267.59 A: yeah 

267.64 268.72 A: yeah 

267.71 274.37 B: he was he thought she was so sophisticated and so [mn] so elegant and and he was to- 

272.46 281.40 A: i know and then you'd see him behind the scenes and you were going oh no no no no no no you are not seeing the real girl here you know [laughter] [mn] yeah she's not sophisticated 

276.02 289.84 B: [laughter] right right and it's just it just made me wonder how [mn] because and then there was the whole guy thing where the only reason he went after zora is because she was this beautiful wild 

289.82 290.81 A: yes 

290.15 292.81 B: woman who just was you know 

293.41 306.29 B: so different from everybody else all the other girls were like way into him and and she was like totally [laughter] i was so shocked when he picked her that that time i thought for sure she was gone you know [laughter] 

295.27 296.63 A: right 

299.75 301.13 A: (( yeah )) 

302.29 303.85 A: well i i see that's 

305.44 316.80 A: that's exactly like the bachelor too because i'll sit there and i'll pick 'em and i'll say oh he's gonna get rid of this one and that one and and yesterday or last night he finally got rid of one that i've been trying to get him to get rid of from the beginning 

307.38 308.99 B: (( [mn] really )) 

315.88 318.41 B: [laughter] 

316.97 323.17 A: i'm like i know she's absolutely drop dead gorgeous but this girl has zero personality 

322.44 323.68 B: yeah 

322.99 337.84 A: you know she [mn] and i would see her clips and things behind the scenes that he wasn't seeing and i was like oh my gosh if he knew that he would get rid of this girl but he finally did last night she finally went and there was only three left but 

327.89 328.95 B: (( right )) 

333.98 335.20 B: yeah 

337.65 342.38 A: you know i've watched one two three of the bachelors and one of the bachelorettes 

342.74 350.32 A: [lipsmack] and i'm thinking to myself i'm watching this show i'm analyzing it if i'm going to be a contestant or a person on this show 

350.59 352.85 A: i'm gonna start getting a strategy now 

352.71 354.78 B: [mn] yeah yeah 

353.01 359.57 A: you know what i mean i'm gonna start figuring a strategy out because they do it the same way every single time 

359.15 360.27 B: yeah 

359.67 367.57 A: i'm gonna start figuring a strategy on this fuzzy you know it's not going to be reality after a while 'cause people are gonna start figuring this thing out a little better 

361.99 363.41 B: [laughter] 

366.41 370.12 B: (( right right right yeah )) 

367.44 374.92 A: yeah yeah yeah but i do i like those and s- survivor was it didn't hold my attention 

374.97 380.49 B: [mn] see i watched the very first one because the people at work were like oh this show survivor they 'cause i 

380.44 391.20 B: i wasn't interested when i heard about it and then the the girls at work were talking about it so i started watching it and then i j- i just got hooked i just because you know that's that was the beginning of it all 

380.47 381.67 A: yeah 

382.84 384.65 A: (( yeah )) 

388.20 389.43 A: [laughter] 

390.86 391.89 A: mhm 

391.18 403.11 B: y- you hadn't seen anything like that before and it was so in- i just [mn] was e- i was enthralled because [mn] i i find it very hard um 

394.32 397.47 A: no no very different 

403.24 406.61 B: [lipsmack] personally to be manipulative 

406.52 408.98 A: ahah i don't think i don't think i could do that stuff 

406.64 421.03 B: and sometimes i end up i i don't i'm not really good with some social graces you know and so i find it c- so intriguing to watch people um 

421.72 425.27 B: dealing with other people and people who are manipulative 

425.17 426.88 A: (( yeah )) 

425.28 432.65 B: it's not that i i don't admire them so much but i'm amazed at how they do it i don't understand how they do it i've 

432.02 433.20 A: i don't either 

432.84 445.57 B: had people in my life that were manipulators and it just amazes me that people can read other people so well and manipulate situations because i so cannot do that 

435.47 436.31 A: (( yep )) 

444.98 453.18 A: no and i so feel bad ah there's a guilt factor there i don't i have a real conscience about things like that and honesty is just 

446.83 448.48 B: [laughter] 

453.01 467.07 A: so important and integrity that i think in some of these shows obviously they have to lose some of that or they're not going to win you know yeah in the mole i watched the mole which was the celebrity mole this last one oh that was funny
