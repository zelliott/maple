81.64 82.50 B: (( yeah )) 

86.54 97.52 A: it doesn't seem hokey it's it's really good singers and um talent and art and the way the business world and the arts works you know all that kind of stuff so

133.80 135.86 B: i ah yeah that he was in the bottom 

135.23 138.92 A: i was really upset yeah i really thought josh should have been 

138.91 151.35 B: yeah i think josh thought he probably would have been [laughter] that's what i heard [laughter] well i i think i don't think clay's ever been in the bottom three so that might be a good sign 

139.07 139.96 A: um 

141.40 145.58 A: yeah [mn] i know he's ha- yeah definitely [laughter] 

148.06 149.57 A: (( uh-uh yeah )) 

150.38 152.61 A: that's a good sign yeah 

151.52 157.41 B: so he he just he's too cute and to be have been put back in the wild card 

156.71 158.74 A: (( mhm )) 

157.50 162.87 B: and barely made it you know i think that's i think that shows a lot for him 

159.05 160.59 A: mhm 

161.54 163.41 A: yeah yeah 

162.98 167.03 B: but um now survivor now i don't see i've never gotten into that i 

167.52 175.78 A: i i used to not watch survivor it just bothered me it kind of bothered me that people were competing for a million dollars it just seems kind of shallow to me [mn] 

175.10 176.95 B: [laughter] 

176.06 182.13 A: just like no offence but just like kind of the bachelor and these married reality shows that everyone's watching 'em but 

179.57 180.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

181.83 182.93 B: i know it 

182.31 197.17 A: i i got into survivor i think it was the australian one and i don't know i just started watching it 'cause it was so what i liked best about survivor was um the games how they had them compete not the eating bugs part i don't like that 

196.59 197.22 B: (( argh )) 

197.45 205.83 A: but they have they're making it more like puzzles and using your mind and it's real interesting how things wind up or psychological games 

205.61 206.52 B: oh 

206.19 210.81 A: and that's what i like now about survivor that's what got me involved i guess with watching it 

210.60 215.31 B: really so where is it at now where's which one which country or 

211.24 212.58 A: mhm 

215.33 221.37 A: that i might wait let me ask real quick 'cause i forget the last one was thailand wh- where is it the survivor oh the amazon 

221.48 223.24 A: it's in the amazon now 

221.63 222.47 B: (( amazon )) 

223.08 224.11 B: (( oh my )) 

223.71 231.25 A: and yeah the one guy got bit by a piranha [laughter] not a little nick but that's what they have to eat they 

227.16 228.00 B: oh 

231.28 239.95 A: [mn] you know yeah ahah and to me it's only like like where they fish but they might catch you know they have to catch piranha that was one of the 

231.33 232.58 B: (( eat piranhas )) 

233.70 234.73 B: (( oh my )) 

240.26 245.93 A: um contests too to catch as many piranha as you could to test your fishing skills i- it was interesting 

245.50 248.95 B: oh my see i probably would get into that show if i just 

248.16 252.19 A: yeah the only thing i don't like about this time the survivor is 

252.52 264.98 A: that people are kind of shallow they're real into the girls' bodies and they're showing the girls like taking baths but i mean they're covered with their hands but it's just like all right [laughter] you know let's get past this [laughter] 

261.37 263.44 B: [laughter] 

263.66 266.34 B: they're really trying to get the reality going 

265.10 275.64 A: and it's that that annoys me but i think if if there is a reason why it's popular i think the guys like watching it [laughter] that's my opinion [laughter] 

271.08 273.89 B: (( [laughter] )) 

274.33 285.44 B: mm well i i just i hadn't i just hadn't gotten into that one i did i did watch when they did the um [lipsmack] i'm a celebrity get me outta here that one i thought that was 

279.00 280.06 A: mhm 

284.57 286.97 A: i've never seen that what's that about 

286.19 292.41 B: it well it was um a whole bunch of celebrities that went and stayed for [mn] [sigh] 

289.30 290.61 A: mhm 

292.33 300.79 B: oh i think sixteen days or something in au- i think it was australia in the jungle and [mn] they got voted off 

300.66 306.96 B: every night or every two nights or something by by the audience they would get to vote em off 

305.03 306.05 A: okay 

306.45 307.43 A: mhm 

306.78 321.15 B: and they had all kinds of challenges and things to do and um and then one whatever whoever won i think it went to a charity whatever they were gonna win or something it's kind of interesting it was a little cheesy but it was okay yeah um 

317.28 318.38 A: mhm 

319.63 322.54 A: yeah and you watched the bachelor one 

322.80 325.01 A: why do you now why do you watch that [laughter] 

324.54 330.89 B: i wat- i don't know i think just to escape life for for a little bit [mn] um 

328.20 329.77 A: (( ah yes )) 

329.93 333.65 A: it's a little rom- it's romantic too i guess some of the things they do and 

333.02 340.27 B: it was romantic the the one i really have liked the best was the bachelorette with the trista 

338.43 339.48 A: oh 

340.29 345.89 B: um she was the first bachelor the one that got um not picked the first time 

345.60 346.93 A: oh 

346.19 349.67 B: and they so they brought her on to do the bachelorette 

349.29 351.33 A: oh how about that okay 

350.28 355.58 B: it was really really good i think i liked it better than the bachelors because 

351.99 353.01 A: yeah 

355.75 358.13 B: it was twenty five men 

358.21 359.05 A: (( ahah )) 

358.46 366.61 B: and men are so much more to me they were just so much more debonair and they they just respected each other they weren't out to be 

366.81 368.24 B: petty and 

367.75 370.78 A: mhm mhm yeah 

368.28 378.78 B: you know how girls you know and they just it was just so much more fund to watch i just enjoyed watching the men and they actually became really good friends and they were like well if it really 

372.06 373.22 A: yeah 

376.19 376.97 A: huh 

379.12 393.54 B: um you know they they wanted the person that really fell in love with her to really be the one to win they weren't out to just oh i'm going to be the one that wins like girls sometimes do even that's what's happening on these other ones they're like oh i'm gonna win 

387.61 388.63 A: right 

393.16 394.55 A: mhm 

393.50 402.47 B: even if they haven't even met him yet you know i'm like you don't even know him [laughter] how do you know if you're gonna like him or not i mean he might not even turn you on you know 

394.97 396.32 A: (( mhm )) 

397.05 401.40 A: (( [laughter] )) 

401.77 403.75 A: [laughter] 

402.78 416.68 B: just looking at him but they're like oh i'm going to be mrs you know whatever but um so the bachelorette to me was the the best one and i hope they do another one but um [mn] i don't know it's just kind of nice to get away and 

403.76 404.87 A: [laughter] 

406.71 407.88 A: right right 

410.05 411.63 A: (( the best yeah )) 

416.37 417.23 A: (( ahah )) 

416.92 426.41 B: i- in in that and just remember what it was like to date [laughter] before you got married [laughter] right 'cause after that 

420.98 422.44 A: yeah right [laughter] 

423.26 432.43 A: [laughter] right and i guess ah the reason why i think american idol too i think it is an escape like i'll i get it 

432.41 439.54 A: i get excited when we wat- like me and my fiance watch and he's a singer so we really like and i'm a i'm a dance teacher so we watch it and 

436.52 437.47 B: oh 

439.46 453.79 A: it's neat watching when they go off and meet stars and they get their hair done and just seeing the it's kind of a fantasy you know of wow look at them you know [laughter] [laughter] hearing some of them are getting a star attitude [laughter] 

443.20 444.33 B: see that's neat 

447.58 448.69 B: oh yeah 

449.34 450.74 B: [laughter] 

453.03 466.82 B: oh i i really like american idol i did not watch the first time around i watched the very last one when justin and kelly were [mn] you know get- getting p- whoever the american idol was gonna be but um [mn] 

455.47 456.22 A: yeah 

457.04 458.36 A: mhm 

461.79 462.75 A: yeah 

465.45 470.50 A: right i heard a lot of people saying that this is a better one but i didn't see the last one 

469.97 476.16 B: see i didn't i i didn't watch it either ah um just at that last part i thought um 

472.38 473.62 A: (( and )) 

475.67 481.81 A: in my opinion i actually like simon and i might be weird but i i like his opinions 

478.98 480.19 B: oh i do too 

481.22 488.47 B: i do too i think he's being honest i think the other ones are not being honest i think they're trying to be you know just sit there and 

482.94 484.19 A: yeah 

487.12 494.36 A: not like yeah they're kinda nice or in a roundabout way especially paula sometimes i don't know what's come out of her mouth [mn] 

493.54 499.13 B: well she probably is the dancer part of it i notice she says a lot about dance and 

497.12 499.90 A: yeah yeah 

499.43 501.07 B: that maybe what she 

501.10 505.64 B: was kind of i know she can sing too but i know she was probably there a lot 

504.15 507.56 A: she's more she was a choreographer and yeah 

505.99 513.04 B: yeah to see if they can kind of do all the moves you know [laughter] [laughter] in 

509.70 520.37 A: yeah yeah but i think simon you know although he's harsh sometimes i like i think he is um he gives the right most of the time gives the right opinion [laughter] most 

519.57 521.20 B: there oh yeah i really 

520.58 522.16 A: of the time i agree with him 

521.71 526.42 B: i like simon i think he i think he just flat out tells you like it is and i think 

522.55 523.57 A: yeah 

525.79 532.19 A: and he's professional i mean even what he said last night because i was freaking out that ruben was in the bottom two 

527.14 528.05 B: mhm 

531.88 532.96 B: mhm 

532.32 537.70 A: and it was nice to hear simon go well you know we have to respect america and this is who 

537.71 544.16 A: this is what they d- they wanted you know so i was surprised he said that i thought he c- he would like freak out or something 

539.42 540.34 B: (( mm )) 

543.76 548.14 B: well i bet you i guess ruben was probably kind of shocked himself 

547.87 552.56 A: [mn] ah yeah and i think ruben's gonna step it up a little 'cause i think that made him i think that shook him up 

552.33 553.96 B: shook him up a little bit 

553.17 556.82 A: yeah i think and i don't know why 

556.69 568.99 A: [mn] i don't know if it's 'cause josh misses not because of the war and everything but because he's a marine i don't know but it was just weird it was really strange 'cause singing singing wise and their voi- their voices i mean ruben is is much better 

568.71 573.41 B: oh yeah i'm i'm not real yeah i wasn't really impressed with josh i was kinda like mm 

571.86 577.32 A: yeah i think he's a good kid but i don't i don't think he's a s- american idol [mn] 

576.91 583.63 B: no i'm surprised i was a little surprised trenice but she i like she's really done a good job 

577.40 578.26 A: (( you know )) 

582.01 595.70 A: i like her sometimes i really liked her when she sang um the first song last night she was real that was really good and sometimes i feel like she swallows her voice so i don't know it's it's back and forth with her 

589.88 591.14 B: see i didn't watch 

595.50 598.25 B: and ah yeah and kimberley's pretty 

597.92 599.95 A: kimberley kimberley's good i think
