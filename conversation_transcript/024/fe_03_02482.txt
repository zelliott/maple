11.42 13.36 B: mhm nice to talk with you 

13.29 14.74 A: all right uh 

14.82 18.55 A: well shall we jump right into the topic or [laughter] 

17.45 19.70 B: yes [laughter] you 

18.72 21.43 A: all right you want to go first or shall i 

20.70 21.27 B: (( can )) 

21.34 21.95 B: (( go )) 

22.16 33.51 A: okay uh well i do watch some reality television not a lot of it i i'm i must say i'm fairly hooked on survivor but that's about the only one 

31.32 32.41 B: mhm 

33.03 34.18 B: mhm 

33.49 46.17 A: i've not gotten into those you know millionaire joe millionaire or how to marry a millionaire or anything like that that just doesn't appeal to me or the american idol or anything like that but i i do enjoy survivor 

39.30 40.48 B: right 

44.45 45.38 B: mhm 

45.79 47.99 B: (( mhm yeah um )) 

49.46 56.54 B: i've watched survivor a few times and [cough] i've watched uh fear factor and i really don't care for it because um one 

51.31 52.31 A: mhm 

56.37 64.81 B: time i was watching it and it was too gross they had to eat like some cheese and maggots were in it and that was really awful so 

63.15 76.83 A: [mn] [laughter] yeah l- like just the promotions for it i thought no this is not for me i i do stand corrected i we do watch one other uh reality show whenever it's on and that's the amazing race 

65.08 66.68 B: (( that kind of put me off )) 

68.62 69.44 B: (( mm mm )) 

76.84 77.87 B: oh okay 

76.86 90.09 A: because we we find a lot of interest in that and particularly as they go round the world we like to travel a lot and so it it's kind of neat to see places where you've been or see places where we may want to go you know [laughter] and things like that but 

82.47 83.51 B: mhm 

87.61 88.76 B: yeah 

88.80 93.48 B: yeah i've never watched that i'll have to look out it it's called the amazing race 

92.47 102.52 A: the amazing race it's on c._b._s. and uh i think it'll be coming on again in the summer they usually run it uh you know about every six months or something like that 

93.64 94.59 B: okay 

95.26 96.41 B: mhm 

101.98 102.91 B: okay 

102.65 106.07 A: and uh it's very interesting they start out with uh 

106.11 108.51 A: teams i i think like you know 

108.48 121.53 A: ten or twelve teams of people and they can be husband and wife or brother and sister or room mates or you know significant others or whatever and they have to travel around the world [mn] 

110.16 111.19 B: mhm 

121.59 130.38 A: doing various challenges as they go and getting there and and trying to get back to the point where they started you know in the first 

124.39 125.59 B: oh i see 

129.21 131.29 B: mhm right okay 

130.54 139.95 A: and so they eliminate uh as they reach different places the last one to come in gets dropped off until it comes down to like you know three teams at the end 

138.52 139.55 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

140.32 143.49 A: so anyway i find it very interesting and i think you would 

142.84 146.58 B: yeah i'd i'd look out for that for sure 'cause i love traveling too 

146.24 156.32 A: mhm but uh anyway so like i say that's my big thing with reality t._v. or you know those two things i'm just not real interested in american idol 

146.64 147.92 B: mhm 

152.15 153.14 B: mhm 

156.01 164.96 B: mm no well i've watched it my daughter um you know told me that i should watch because um we're originally from alabama and there is um a participant 

156.63 157.63 A: (( and mhm )) 

164.83 175.75 B: and he has a beautiful voice so i watched him um the past few weeks but that was my first time you know really 'cause i really haven't gotten into you know those type of shows i just you know 

169.22 170.16 A: uh-huh 

171.19 172.38 A: i see yeah 

174.15 175.42 A: yeah 

175.54 187.52 B: um i've watched who wants to be a millionaire though um a few times when it first came out i- i was you know i liked it a lot but now i've kinda like gotten away from it because i don't think they paid the contestants enough 

175.83 177.38 A: and like it's like just 

184.07 185.06 A: uh-huh 

187.29 195.43 B: they sh- i think they should pay the last two that you know s- get to stay on i think they should pay that other person something not not just let one take it all mhm 

187.40 188.59 A: really 

194.61 203.49 A: exactly exactly um of course the ultimate in reality t._v. of course we've just had with the war coverage and 

201.66 202.67 B: yes 

202.68 203.98 B: oh i tell you 

203.80 207.78 A: i just [sigh] n- i uh well it it was so 

208.20 214.06 A: riveting and and yet so excessive i thought it was just yes yes 

211.41 220.19 B: too excessive yeah i i just started t- tuning it out you know and and wouldn't even turn on you know to it because they i mean it's just like an overkill 

214.98 216.80 A: mhm mhm 

219.97 222.14 A: exactly exactly 

220.53 233.48 B: mhm i don't even know if they're still you know doing it all the time or not on c._n._n. i'll bet they are but i just won't even go there anymore because i'm just you know the mind it it just gets so conditioned and all the violence and the you know 

227.45 228.30 A: yeah 

232.80 234.21 A: exactly 

233.73 238.31 B: we we have enough going on in society with adding more to it i think 

237.70 239.40 A: [mn] thank you very much 

238.55 240.25 B: mhm 

239.50 241.45 A: that's that's for sure 

240.90 242.29 B: mhm 

241.71 246.59 A: and it's a lot of the uh reality shows that that i've seen like the particularly the 

246.82 255.52 A: one about who wants to marry a millionaire or something just seemed demeaning to me i just you know please people you know [laughter] 

248.88 251.17 B: yeah mhm 

251.39 252.62 B: very 

252.91 254.00 B: mhm 

254.31 264.09 B: it's awful because i think that a man if he wants a wife he should go and find her she shouldn't be exploiting herself in front of america trying to see [laughter] you know 

259.27 260.88 A: exactly 

263.24 276.48 A: no ex- exactly and you know so much you know more for the woman i you know like i say we we have come a long way [laughter] a- and to be up there like a piece of meat like you know please pick me pick me it's oh 

264.31 265.26 B: (( mm mm )) 

269.11 271.96 B: yes we have we definitely have i know 

272.59 279.52 B: [laughter] and like it's their last chance you know and [mn] 

278.19 279.70 A: exactly 

279.99 286.88 B: who's to say that there's going to be anything to that you know i i just mm mm it's just too um 

283.84 285.01 A: mhm 

287.22 294.99 B: too demeaning and too degrading for a woman to put herself through something like that hold on for a second yes i am [noise] 

289.58 293.80 A: well yeah and y- you know it just smacks so much of some sure 

295.23 296.05 B: okay 

295.71 303.70 A: it just smacks so much of somebody you know really wanting their fifteen minutes of fame or something like that hang on people get a life you know [laughter] 

300.46 310.19 B: right and wanting to be dis- i know i know go get a life and wanting to be discovered before america you know and mm mm i don't even think that um 

306.99 308.06 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

308.41 309.58 A: really 

310.35 315.68 B: how how would their families feel you know 'cause [laughter] that's what i think about 

313.00 314.20 A: really 

314.33 324.98 A: well like i say you know with american idol at least you can see that they are okay trying to get discovered they do have a verifiable talent [laughter] of sorts [laughter] but [laughter] [mn] 

319.85 321.08 B: right 

322.78 328.92 B: exactly and they are competing you know and everything and people are voting for them so yeah 

326.02 327.07 A: uh-huh 

327.45 335.69 A: but l- like i say these marriage things or meeting yeah the bachelor and things like that i just think oh how awful you know 

329.75 331.12 B: (( i know )) 

332.38 333.70 B: mhm 

334.38 347.15 B: how awful right i mean they couldn't make up anything better than that to put on t._v. you know mm mm i would not even wanna try and participate because i wouldn't want anybody to see how desperate i was 

339.04 339.94 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

340.33 341.30 A: really 

341.38 342.40 A: really 

346.49 353.69 A: oh a- absolutely i oh that is oh anyway i just can't imagine anybody who has so little self esteem that they would 

347.81 349.32 B: mhm 

353.00 354.54 B: mm i know 

353.73 356.13 A: you know take part in that sort of thing 

355.72 358.79 B: i know i just i can't see it either 

356.74 358.17 A: i really can't 

358.90 360.60 A: so what do you do erica

382.90 383.96 A: uh-huh 

384.12 394.05 A: that's right i i'm on my computer and watching t._v. and but uh so like i'm saying s- i'm going oh gee is this really on now [laughter]

392.88 397.42 B: [laughter] yeah 

395.72 405.52 A: it's amazing just amazing but but i keep following it and that's what you know that's what just blows me away is that apparently these things are so popular 

397.43 399.67 B: i know mhm 

402.52 403.54 B: mhm 

405.19 416.93 B: people are watching because otherwise it it wouldn't keep coming on yeah but i think the newness of it but i don't think it's going to last like you know um fear factor i don't think that show will really last 

406.28 408.00 A: yes yes 

408.56 410.09 A: exactly 

416.22 423.56 A: yeah i i think eventually it's gonna you know g- gross people to the max [laughter] or something like that but uh [mn] 

417.11 418.52 B: it is too gross 

420.50 425.74 B: mhm mhm yeah i've heard that a a few people have sued them also 

425.46 426.39 A: mhm 

426.03 426.93 B: yeah 

426.64 435.21 A: i don't doubt that i don't doubt that but i will be watching survivor tonight to see who gets voted off [laughter] 

427.70 429.12 B: mm mm me either 

431.65 432.80 B: oh okay 

433.08 436.70 B: [laughter] 

436.08 442.13 A: and then i guess like i say all about t._v. i guess i'll be watching george bush's speech after that so 

441.21 445.12 B: i know oh he's coming on tonight okay maybe i'll watch a little just to see what 

444.57 450.71 A: yeah i think they said at uh eight o'clock we're we're central time zone so that'd be nine o'clock your time i think

450.73 452.36 A: yeah mhm 

452.41 453.68 A: but anyway 

453.70 460.28 A: so uh i think that that's just kind of you know my feelings on reality t._v. i don't know where else to go with 

460.46 463.36 B: i know i don't know either i mean 

460.50 462.43 A: (( it [laughter] )) 

462.82 468.30 A: h- having said my piece you know that sort of thing i think we're supposed to wait 'til they tell us that it's 

464.44 465.77 B: mhm 

468.38 471.19 A: the time is up but uh anyway 

468.48 471.31 B: 'til it's over yeah we are mhm
