0.12 1.42 B: (( hello )) 

0.73 8.15 A: hi i'm heather michelle [laughter] [laughter] nice to meet you too are you in los angeles 

1.99 6.01 B: hi i'm michelle [laughter] hi heather nice to meet you [laughter] 

7.90 10.28 B: no no i'm in indiana indianapolis 

9.26 12.26 A: oh okay [laughter] 

11.56 13.46 B: have you is this the first time you've ever 

12.57 14.10 A: yeah 

13.55 16.36 B: this is the second time i've done it 

15.39 16.81 A: okay so 

17.22 21.10 A: ah did you get the list of stuff we're supposed to be discussing okay 

19.57 23.31 B: yeah i can't remember everything but i got the list um basically 

21.88 22.77 A: okay 

23.72 26.26 B: smoking drinking alcohol 

24.59 25.79 A: over eating 

26.11 28.08 A: over eating and not exercising 

27.88 28.93 B: yes 

28.55 31.17 A: and drinking caffeine okay 

30.29 31.79 B: yes that's it 

31.84 32.96 A: (( ah )) 

31.88 33.75 B: so what do you think is worse 

33.33 34.41 A: um 

35.17 44.76 A: [mn] it's a tie i think smoking is definitely probably the worst for the person doing it and for the country as a whole 

44.63 45.50 B: yes 

45.04 48.25 A: because it creates huge health costs for ah 

49.37 56.54 A: for everybody involved and the people don't have money to pay and they get sick and then the county ends up paying which is basically the tax payer so 

56.88 63.03 A: it's pretty bad and it also ah has some unintended consequences like people like driving smoking 

62.61 64.11 B: oh i hate that 

63.50 64.99 A: not paying attention 

64.50 66.36 B: that drives me crazy 

65.44 68.77 A: and causing accidents so i'd have to say smoking 

69.77 71.92 A: (( is [laughter] )) 

71.04 73.08 B: i would say smoking is probably 

73.14 74.81 B: yeah the worst thing 

74.91 81.96 B: for your health and the health not just of you i mean it's like if you [sigh] i mean it's like it's probably the only thing that 

76.69 77.69 A: and others 

81.91 90.89 B: you can damage the people that live in your house also i mean like if you drink it probably physically and emotionally scares people but the 

84.51 86.30 A: (( that's why anyone who's )) 

91.08 93.47 B: if you especially if you have children 

93.50 94.50 A: right 

93.53 98.11 B: smoking in the house i mean it's just it's a really bad thing 

97.70 102.94 A: that's why anyone who's around that after growing up in that for sixteen seventeen years inhaling that 

102.64 103.82 B: mhm 

103.15 112.33 A: it cannot be good and everyone who walks in so yeah you've got a- additional health costs and health risks associated for everybody else of course alcohol you 

112.47 117.31 A: could say that as well because if you're getting in a car with somebody who's been drinking and ah on the road 

117.37 118.44 B: yes 

118.29 125.01 A: but [laughter] but you can drink in moderation where you can't smoke and have it ever be like a good thing for you 

119.44 120.43 B: [mn] 

124.71 134.75 B: no and almost never does your smoking not affect the other people around you where if you have a couple of drinks that normally doesn't affect the other people that are sitting there with you 

128.32 129.31 A: right 

133.17 135.99 A: and you can't and people don't smoke one cigarette 

136.57 139.13 A: a day or something [laughter] 

137.83 143.78 B: no [laughter] even if they did why would they smoke at all [laughter] 

141.57 146.93 A: right [laughter] apparently it's highly addictive so i don't do any of these things so [laughter] 

146.23 149.03 B: no yeah i don't anymore i smoked in college 

148.41 149.91 A: oh is that right oh 

149.20 155.30 B: yeah i i drink every once and awhile not a whole lot just because i don't know 

155.04 158.41 A: yeah i don't really i'm actually an avid runner so ah 

158.17 169.76 B: oh did ya i run too and that's one of the reasons i stopped smoking because it's like i smoked in college and then like on new year's eve when we h- like all my friends graduated we all made a pact to quit smoking 

159.27 160.08 A: right 

161.62 163.38 A: yeah it interferes 

169.62 171.38 A: oh that worked okay 

169.96 178.46 B: and i think all of us but one did like hasn't hasn't smoked since then and one one of my friends still smokes so 

177.65 182.28 A: yeah it's ah especially looked down upon in california because very few people smoke 

182.12 193.84 B: yes i know i used to date a guy out there [laughter] and i was in college when i was dating him [laughter] so it was like i'd like fly out over the summer sometimes and yeah and i smoked then so i was just like 

183.72 185.98 A: [laughter] 

186.78 188.53 A: (( oh so yeah )) 

191.67 192.51 A: (( uh-huh )) 

192.79 196.27 A: it's a non starter a lot of people would never date anybody who smoked 

195.97 200.30 B: i know he said the same thing 'cause i hadn't i hadn't smoked in front of him 

197.61 198.68 A: (( yeah )) 

200.47 207.46 B: i i don't know i just never told him and i was like oh really [laughter] 

201.50 202.99 A: it's an immediate 

204.25 213.55 A: [laughter] yeah different parts of the country it's not like that but here it's an immediate disqualifier so 'cause nobody wants to be around that and you can't smoke anywhere now here 

210.01 210.96 B: yeah 

213.76 221.57 B: no and it's really a good thing i mean i w- i kind of wish that the atmosphere like here was a lot like that because i really didn't start smoking until i was in college 

221.03 223.79 A: when everyone else was doing it probably 

222.51 227.82 B: yeah and i'd lived with the i'd lived with these girls for probably six months before 

228.08 229.63 B: i ever smoked 

228.25 230.77 A: oh you picked it up were they smoking as well 

230.43 233.79 B: oh yeah they smoked all the time that's why it was like 

231.86 233.03 A: (( oh there you go )) 

233.98 237.01 B: yeah and then i did i did all through college and then 

237.08 243.08 B: it really makes a huge difference because i run all the time too and it's like when i stopped 

240.64 241.56 A: yeah 

242.34 245.47 A: i can't even imagine trying to run [laughter] 

244.63 257.18 B: it's really i didn't i think it didn't affect me that much because i was young but it's like when i stopped and i i noticed a huge difference in my performance when i stopped smoking when i started running and it's funny because about 

248.10 249.87 A: right then as you get older 

257.35 266.42 B: two or three weeks after i stopped smoking i really started coughing stuff up out of my lungs it was really gross yeah and i didn't expect that at all 

262.40 264.28 A: (( ooh really )) 

264.83 265.60 A: oh 

265.92 267.47 A: oh my god [laughter] 

267.02 270.80 B: yeah and it wasn't like right away it's like not it was like two or three weeks later 

269.53 273.52 A: it takes a long while right for your lungs to actually start healing 

273.16 278.21 B: yeah 'cause like i'd be heavy on the treadmill and i'd get off and i'd just cough 

276.85 277.82 A: oh 

278.24 280.27 A: oh my god [laughter] 

279.23 285.60 B: yeah i know and that that was just the short period of time well i mean relatively i mean i only smoked for like three and a half years 

283.02 284.80 A: right it wasn't a lifetime 

285.54 286.99 A: (( oh my god )) 

285.75 290.74 B: so and i didn't even smoke all the time it was mostly just when i drank like you know 

289.96 292.48 A: (( [laughter] so silly did )) 

291.36 293.76 B: so i mean i can't even imagine people 

294.19 298.62 B: people who do and i think another thing is it's like my grandpa or my grandmother died 

298.98 302.05 B: she had smoked all of her life she had 

301.03 303.52 A: she died of lung cancer or emphysema or 

302.84 312.15 B: no emphysema she had emphysema and congestive heart failure and like i was in the room like i actually saw her die and it was she couldn't breath 

304.37 305.27 A: mm 

311.82 313.08 A: oh god 

312.19 315.44 B: she was on oxygen like the last three years of her life and it's like 

315.46 321.25 B: i had already stopped smoking then but i was just like oh my gosh that would be now like 

319.98 321.94 A: that's not a nice way to go 

321.41 323.77 B: no uh-huh it was horrible 

322.36 324.11 A: (( that was definitely argh )) 

324.16 325.18 B: (( so yeah )) 

325.16 327.30 A: [laughter] 

326.39 328.07 B: i would have to say smoking 

327.57 337.89 A: although i yeah like drinking and 'cause it does ruin your life and ah of other people around you and you can't hold a job necessarily and it really 

337.80 344.49 B: no i would think i haven't really known anybody who has a serious alcohol problem but yeah people who do i mean it can 

341.55 343.45 A: yeah but when they do it's 

343.65 345.08 A: it ruins your life 

344.79 348.44 B: wreck the hav- wreck havoc on your body so 

347.80 356.28 A: yeah and you that's all you think about is when your next drink is kind of ruining your whole life and getting d._u._i.s and you lose your licence and it's 

356.50 357.81 A: (( pretty bad )) 

357.57 358.59 B: yeah 

357.94 362.60 A: and i'm not fond of ah over eating [laughter] but i don't think they're actually 

362.43 363.90 B: [laughter] 

363.25 372.54 A: hurting anybody but themselves [laughter] [laughter] not being overweight it's hard for me to envision [laughter] what 

365.48 367.56 B: no i know but 

371.53 381.70 B: see i'm not either but i i think it's just because i'm lucky i i have a high metabolism and i work out all the time so it's like but i love food i mean it's like i can't imagine 

375.96 376.94 A: right 

382.00 390.40 B: like i mean i diet in the sense that i eat healthy like i pay attention to what i eat but i can't like all these diets that people do i can't no i couldn't do it 

382.12 383.03 A: right 

387.83 389.12 A: oh forget it 

389.49 392.30 A: yeah i don't do any of that stuff either i just eat what i want 

392.20 399.66 B: yeah and i think i can because i work out but if i didn't oh that would be so well that'd be hard [laughter] 

392.89 393.94 A: [laughter] 

399.08 403.69 A: well yeah just as soon as you take in more calories than you're working off that's it i 

404.11 412.56 A: know so the other the only other thing that wasn't physical was gossip that was on our list look gossip can be bad but it can't kill anyone i don't think 

404.91 405.71 B: and 

410.48 414.23 B: that i know that really bothers me too but 

413.54 416.02 A: [laughter] 

415.05 422.11 B: but yeah and that is that's probably i don't know that i think that hurts the person who's gossiping as much i mean 

421.30 424.54 A: as much as a- can as much as the person they're talking about 

424.20 430.02 B: or at least it reveals more about that person because i actually i had a room mate a couple of years' ago 

425.83 427.13 A: their character 

430.19 432.01 B: who's really negative 

432.18 445.72 B: and really talked bad about people all the time and i never realised that until she moved out like what an impact she had in the house like her just her being negative all the time like who it changed everybody in the house 

445.52 446.29 A: (( oh )) 

445.88 459.70 B: and then once she moved out it was just there was just a huge difference and i think that that is so much more subtle you don't realise that like when somebody's negative and talks bad about people all the time what an impact it has on relationships 

453.73 454.81 A: yeah 

459.51 463.82 A: and if the word gets back to that person whom they're talking about what it does 

463.38 464.81 B: oh yeah 

463.94 467.65 A: which it usually does get back to them i had somebody do something 

467.72 470.04 A: crazy like a year ago um 

470.19 477.37 A: i met a guy and we exchanged numbers and got on and whatever and ah she called him like the next day and said don't go out with her 

476.91 477.72 B: (( [mn] )) 

477.96 479.49 A: you don't know about her 

478.17 480.02 B: was it your friend 

479.84 490.74 A: it was somebody i knew but and she was not a friend she's just somebody sort of in my cir- yeah clearly not [laughter] somebody in my circle and she really went out of her way to just to try and like 

483.19 486.73 B: ah clearly [laughter] [mn] 

490.52 495.92 A: basically ah ruin a possible relationship and i couldn't figure out why what she had against me 

495.96 498.97 A: and ah it didn't stop at that one phone call she 

499.20 502.90 A: made a couple of calls and every time she ran into him she said you're not going out with heather are you 

503.43 504.56 B: did he ever 

503.46 511.51 A: [laughter] and he sort of yeah we did go out he sort of threatened her she threatened him like if you do you're not going to be able to do x y and z with us 

511.71 513.40 B: oh my gosh 

511.84 516.04 A: like you're not going to be able to be a part of our tennis group or something and i'm like 

514.86 516.47 B: [laughter] 

516.46 525.00 A: whatever but i finally like six to eight months later i got her alone and said what the heck what were you doing i don't even know you 

525.20 538.26 A: what on earth so why would you do such a thing it's like well i thought you'd been flirting when i was engaged ah with my fiance and it really hurt me so i just did this out of hurt it's like yeah thanks 

533.34 534.74 B: oh my gosh 

537.23 542.12 B: so instead of like coming to you and talking to you about it and clearing everything up [laughter] 

538.81 541.07 A: yeah exactly 

541.10 544.85 A: never right never said a word to me i was just supposed to know this or something 

544.71 546.59 B: oh my gosh 

545.82 552.61 A: right 'cause she was like holding in all this negative feeling for years and then [laughter] got her chance 

552.67 557.63 B: see 'cause gossiping is so and it's always like it's always sneaky and behind the back 

557.04 559.03 A: oh well she ended up being furious 

559.32 566.81 A: that the guy had told me she said the stuff she wasn't like embarrassed for herself as much as that she was angry 

565.43 566.44 B: she was 

566.98 571.44 A: with the person who told me with the guy so instead of saying 

569.10 569.81 B: (( argh )) 

571.62 577.74 A: okay [laughter] i shouldn't have done this and i won't do it again and learning a lesson and apologizing to me 

578.22 581.24 A: she immediately called him and said i can't believe you told her 

581.80 582.74 B: well 

582.11 583.92 A: [laughter] 

582.75 586.39 B: you know that's funny because that's how the like this girl was like 

586.42 592.48 B: she'd do it like there were four of us that lived here and she would do that she'd go from one person to the other and tell things 

592.05 594.03 A: about each other in the house 

593.45 597.94 B: yeah and then when we got together about it she got really mad at us 

594.40 595.18 A: (( oh )) 

595.79 596.99 A: right 

597.23 598.63 A: what a surprise 

598.15 599.95 B: yeah got mad at us
