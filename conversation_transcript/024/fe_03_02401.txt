0.00 1.72 A: hi i'm hillary 

1.18 2.94 B: hi i'm cathy 

3.89 5.14 B: how are you doing 

4.67 6.38 A: (( i'm good how are you )) 

5.62 8.44 B: [laughter] interesting topic tonight 

8.07 10.22 A: (( it was how many times have you done this )) 

9.89 11.65 B: this is my second time 

10.95 14.08 A: okay me too what was your first topic 

12.12 13.05 B: okay 

13.71 15.04 B: um illness 

14.75 16.66 A: oh mine was friendship 

16.09 19.05 B: oh sounds a lot easier than [laughter] 

18.62 24.83 A: it was gosh i just scribbled down that list she just ran over um about which was worse 

25.15 27.32 A: i don't know if you want to go first or oh how 

26.93 35.25 B: well i i guess so [laughter] well um i think out of the whole list um i guess i would have to pick smoking even though i do smoke 

35.00 39.34 A: funny [laughter] [laughter] okay why do you think that's the worst 

36.00 37.67 B: [laughter] 

39.10 41.17 B: well i i think it would 

41.43 46.22 B: i think it's worse because not only does it hurt you it hurts people around you 

46.03 47.31 A: that's true 

47.01 50.06 B: and it's i mean out of all of the things 

50.38 58.21 B: it's it's the one that i i would think would be the most damaging i mean i know you know drinking alcohol can 

58.37 65.27 B: hurt your liver and over eating you know can cause all sorts of problems but it just seems like i don't know maybe with all the research 

65.34 73.85 B: i see [laughter] every day or if it's because i smoke and i'm more sensitive to it but it seems like smoking would be the worst for me how about you 

74.05 88.96 A: um well i was going to say alcohol but i get your point now because if someone's drinking yes they're ruining their own life and of course they're ruining the lives of their friends and families but not well i guess it is directly but it's not the same as smoking um 

86.74 87.67 B: yeah 

89.49 92.02 A: oh i don't know between those two i 

91.36 92.73 B: yeah 

92.07 94.04 A: mean none of these things are great 

93.70 94.91 B: (( yeah )) 

94.07 95.10 A: um 

95.11 97.79 A: i would say still stick with the alcohol 

98.04 100.77 A: i don't know pr- it probably is smoking though 

100.78 101.88 B: yeah 

101.15 105.91 A: why do you choose to smoke even though you just picked that just 'cause you're addicted 

104.00 110.20 B: actually i i yeah w- i- i'm trying to quit and i did quit for two years [laughter] 

109.65 111.14 A: (( oh but that's great )) 

110.30 117.51 B: and then one day i got stressed out and started back again [laughter] and it's been a couple of months so i know i have to quit it's just 

113.16 114.67 A: (( oh no )) 

117.97 125.29 B: it's wanting to quit enough it's really hard when you're addicted but i mean you can do it and i know you can but it's 

123.28 124.44 A: right 

124.65 126.83 A: (( well how long did you quit for )) 

126.70 134.21 B: um it was it was two years oh that was my drier [laughter] i don't know if you heard that my drier just went off [laughter] 

129.53 130.48 A: oh my 

132.87 147.41 A: oh no no no i didn't hear it that's quite a long time to have quit and then come back to it but i guess you like you said stress is one of the things that causes that sure it probably causes that and over eating and alcohol not like i know anything but 

137.39 138.84 B: yeah 

141.82 143.06 B: yeah 

146.56 148.97 B: my husband smokes too so 

148.64 152.43 A: oh so when he's smoking you were probably like okay i want one 

151.97 158.21 B: yeah that was it i mean i there was a cigarette next to me and i was super stressed out one day and 

156.98 158.61 A: [laughter] 

158.26 159.54 B: and then 

159.92 164.02 A: do ya'll live in in a i don't know where ya'll live but i know cal- um 

164.04 168.59 A: where is it that you're not allowed to smoke in bars or restaurants it's california isn't it 

168.23 169.42 B: yeah 

168.99 174.28 A: which is great do you think that'll be something that takes over in most states eventually 

173.95 174.88 B: um 

175.13 188.15 B: you know i i heard i live in florida and i heard that they passed a law it was it was on the ballot back in november but i haven't seen any change so either the law hasn't come into effect yet 

178.06 178.67 A: (( oh )) 

187.55 188.70 A: mhm 

188.12 191.82 B: or it's not people are just ignoring it 

191.80 192.80 A: right 

191.95 197.24 B: because i've seen some restaurants n- not have smoking 

197.29 198.41 A: mhm 

197.47 200.72 B: like since the law passed but not all 

199.49 200.44 A: mhm 

200.89 201.87 A: huh 

200.94 205.95 B: so maybe the law is just too broad some places can have it and some can't 

203.51 204.88 A: it could be 

205.67 213.59 A: yeah well i know myself that when somebody's smoking beside me i like to move away because it bothers me but my mother did smoke 

210.23 211.67 B: yeah [laughter] 

213.87 217.18 A: goodness from such a young age until 

217.49 223.44 A: i would say i was in college so probably ten years ago so sh- so she probably smoked for at least thirty years oh 

223.06 226.94 B: yes my mother did too and she quit i'd say about three years ago 

226.20 228.04 A: (( good for her )) 

227.24 237.57 B: yeah [laughter] yeah she did a great job yes she just got mad one day and then that was it and i'm kind of hoping that'll be what happens for me 

228.27 229.68 A: (( that's fabulous )) 

230.29 232.12 A: that is wonderful 

235.62 236.83 A: (( yeah i )) 

237.43 243.27 A: wonder if anybody on this survey would say gossiping is the worst i couldn't imagine somebody picking that one 

242.55 249.48 B: yeah i i mean it- it's not a good thing to do but you know [laughter] all of the 

247.31 259.47 A: right but it's not the worst of course i hadn't exercised actually myself in two years and about a year ago it would be two years from a year ago too it's been now three years 

259.42 265.66 A: and a year ago i set myself up and raised money to run the half marathon 

265.37 266.25 B: oh 

265.87 280.48 A: and for the leukemia and lymphoma society and so i exercised for the past year and then that race was this past week and i'm now like oh god i can't imagine exercising again [laughter] again and again but i wouldn't say it's the worst thing in the world by any means 

275.04 276.62 B: [laughter] 

280.23 287.24 B: no i i think it's it's just that it would be more worse on you know hard on yourself i know that mentally 

285.32 286.39 A: yeah 

287.36 289.16 B: it's you're a lot 

289.18 293.74 B: more mentally focused and things you feel better about yourself when you exercise 

292.91 294.41 A: mhm 

293.76 295.87 B: when you get out of bed it's kinda [laughter] 

295.64 296.91 A: [laughter] 

296.19 297.54 B: hard 

297.25 299.13 A: true it is very true 

297.78 301.30 B: i don't exercise too much i try to walk every day 

300.96 302.64 A: oh well that's good 

301.87 303.12 B: yeah 

303.02 307.11 A: and then the over eating of course that also is not a great thing 

306.37 307.91 B: yeah 

307.17 319.19 A: i sometimes eat even though i'm full but just 'cause i wanna eat it even though i know i can save it for later i still eat it but it hasn't started to show up on me yet it will eventually i know because my mother it showed up on 

310.09 311.24 B: [laughter] 

311.60 313.00 B: (( yeah )) 

319.35 321.98 B: yeah [laughter] it catches up eventually 

321.45 330.71 A: yeah i watched an oprah show you probably might laugh at me for saying that but it was actually on over eating and a lot of people over eat and it was pretty recent it was in the past month 

330.83 336.06 A: and she obviously thought it was a really big issue but i still would put smoking and alcohol above that 

335.97 343.81 B: it think it's interesting these these choices because it seems like people that choose to engage in this behavior for the same reason 

343.82 345.30 A: well that's true 

345.14 351.67 B: i mean usually there's something going on in the person's life that would cause them to smoke or cause them to drink 

351.78 353.68 B: or not exercise 

351.91 354.50 A: and over eat yeah 

353.75 357.34 B: (( or gossip i don't know gossip's kind of out there )) 

356.51 358.54 A: (( that one's kind of ringing of our there )) 

358.09 359.49 B: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

358.57 367.86 A: i don't know where they got that one but well as far as alcohol is concerned i'm sure that i i don't know how much you drink but we all have friends that 

368.08 373.71 A: unfortunately may become alcoholic or or are alcoholics but we don't know it yet or have been 

373.82 380.12 A: i i don't know if you went to college but i remember thinking some of my friends were going to turn out serious alcoholics 

377.15 382.63 B: oh yeah [laughter] when i was in college when i was in college i i drank a lot 

382.16 383.16 A: yeah 

382.87 386.46 B: i don't think i would say i was an alcoholic because 

386.87 395.31 B: but i definitely had a problem with it but the reason i don't think i was an alcoholic was because i recognized it and i was like that's it [laughter] 

388.64 390.04 A: mhm 

393.39 394.62 A: oh that's good 

395.01 396.44 A: that's great 

395.80 399.04 B: i was just and i actually i took a third shift job 

399.06 404.06 B: [laughter] yeah i took a third shift job so i wouldn't have to 

399.27 400.94 A: wow 

403.55 404.83 A: be around 

404.18 408.71 B: yeah this was in the summer [laughter] and by the fall 

406.39 408.20 A: (( oh my )) 

408.87 409.87 A: yeah 

408.87 414.73 B: and by the fall i didn't and now i have a drink occasionally it doesn't really 

414.87 421.84 B: but my um in-laws they were alcoholics well i guess you always are [laughter] but um 

416.48 417.57 A: mhm 

419.81 421.47 A: right right right 

422.22 424.39 B: when when my husband was younger 

424.46 428.86 B: and he you know he has a lot different experience from my parents 

428.89 431.11 B: i've never s- well i can't say 

431.22 435.57 B: i i wouldn't say i've never seen my parents drink i've never seen my dad drink but my mom 

435.78 436.89 A: mhm 

436.25 438.54 B: h- had a glass of wine a couple of times 

438.58 442.79 A: oh well i still would consider that not drinking like you were about to say 

441.88 445.46 B: yeah they were always of the had the idea that 

445.54 455.99 B: you know you gotta be careful 'cause if you if you have a drink you might become an alcoholic [laughter] weird because well i guess it wouldn't be weird i was going to say weird because my mom smoked but maybe that's why 

449.63 451.17 A: right right 

455.73 463.67 A: could be that's my dad drinks more alcohol than my mom but my mom used to smoke so i don't know if there's a correlation there 

456.37 457.65 B: (( [laughter] 'cause she )) 

463.76 476.74 A: do you i i don't know you were talking about hearing things i only see commercials um about smoking like and how it kills ex amount of people or the tobacco companies this and tobacco companies that i never see 

477.17 483.49 A: alcoholic you know this is what except this is what no that was the drugs remember that commercial this is what happens when you 

481.79 483.21 B: yeah 

483.65 487.90 A: are on drugs and they do that egg in a pot i never see anything about alcohol 

487.71 488.79 B: i don't 

488.86 490.22 A: i can't recall 

489.32 501.43 B: i i don't either and i don't know if it's because i mean i know that there is a lot of tobacco settlement money that paid for that and since there's no alcohol settlement i don't know it doesn't seem like 

495.58 496.72 A: mhm 

500.13 501.49 A: (( but okay )) 

501.50 505.48 B: there's any public health initiative for that 

505.01 507.12 A: (( mhm i don't know )) 

506.10 508.31 B: i just think it's kind of a shame 

508.12 516.80 A: yeah and i wonder how many other i'm not knowledgeable enough to know how many deaths are caused because the person was a smoker versus how many deaths there are 

516.90 520.31 A: caused by alcoholics i don't i don't know anything 

519.10 520.70 B: i don't know either 

520.52 532.83 A: it would be interesting to know that obviously before we talked about which thing is worse that would probably base my answer you know my answer would be based on that information i haven't done enough studying about either of the topics 

523.72 525.22 B: (( [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

529.00 529.83 B: (( [laughter] )) 

532.62 534.79 B: me neither i mean 

534.82 541.36 B: the smoking issue it would be kind of surprising if alcohol kills more people because you're bombarded every day 

541.39 544.25 A: well that's true with smoking yeah 

542.14 543.50 B: with smoking 

543.67 545.79 B: but it probably is smoking 

545.77 551.76 A: i think you're probably right i wonder if they're even close i don't know now i'm curious to see 

547.08 548.28 B: but i mean 

549.36 554.10 B: [laughter] yeah i don't think gossiping kills people at all [laughter] 

553.18 561.54 A: no no and over eat- over eating probably leads to other diseases that cause people to die 

558.86 559.95 B: yeah 

561.62 566.53 B: i think over eating would cause a larger number of ways to die 

566.24 567.96 A: yeah okay that's true 

566.69 567.98 B: than smoking 

568.19 572.16 B: you know like smoking would cause lung cancer and heart disease 

570.34 572.80 A: mhm mhm 

572.26 576.84 B: and probably some other ailments that aren't emphysema that'll kill you 

575.78 577.76 A: mhm mhm 

577.08 577.91 B: but 

578.21 586.64 B: i think over eating actually causes more like problems of that nature or not lung cancer emphysema but like heart disease 

584.63 585.94 A: (( right )) 

586.04 587.45 A: right 

586.82 589.93 B: and like bone and joint problems 

589.56 591.47 A: right circulation yes 

591.00 592.70 B: yeah things like that 

592.86 595.74 B: i know my um my mother in law's overweight 

595.66 596.67 A: mhm 

596.03 599.95 B: and she's really she you know she's trying to lose weight
