20.74 22.51 B: okay how do you feel about it 

22.73 32.16 A: um i'm not sure if how how i feel one way or the other i really haven't watched too much of it ah the little bits that i have seen i can understand how people get sucked into it 

27.12 28.21 B: right 

31.66 38.31 B: yeah but ha- have so you haven't really watched i ac- honestly haven't watched any of it but what i've heard is 

38.53 41.64 B: b- basically it's not good 

41.69 46.00 B: n- n- not to not it's very actually it's not informative so uh 

46.50 49.54 B: what's to me my purpose is what's the use of watching it 

48.93 49.60 A: (( [noise] )) 

49.55 59.70 A: well it's certainly not very indepth uh and it's certainly not promoting humanity [laughter] humanity in any sense but i i think that there is something i i i've seen like 

51.57 52.25 B: (( [cough] )) 

59.64 69.69 A: an episode here an episode there um mostly uh you know with friends or whatnot and and there there is something very disturbingly entertaining 

69.63 75.78 B: no that that i believe just what's that um ah the one about the the bachelorette bachelor 

74.28 74.83 A: (( ah )) 

75.49 76.67 A: right 

76.05 80.06 B: i mean i feel that y- just going on t._v. for that purpose 

80.10 89.00 B: is i mean honestly how h- [mn] i [mn] i don't even i don't remember what timeframe they give you to even know the person i mean you could be with somebody in in real life 

89.03 91.95 B: a- a year or two years and still not know them 

91.68 97.63 A: right yeah i mean it's it's not a very good way to meet people i i i don't think at all but 

92.28 93.17 B: what 

96.33 103.17 B: yeah well it's i definitely don't believe in them that survivor from what i hear it's what in it's in its uh twelfth series if i'm correct 

103.94 106.56 A: it's been around a while yeah i'm not sure 

104.00 105.18 B: (( something like that )) 

105.34 108.69 B: yeah 'cause well and that information i got just from [mn] 

108.81 117.47 B: uh actually reading a newspaper which stated that just a lot of the reality shows are getting getting sickening but they seem to uh draw in a crowd 

117.41 128.30 B: because obviously it's like i said survivor's in its twelfth series and then you have the i think they have like two new reality shows going on now well that are supposed to be actually coming up [mn] 

127.86 130.90 A: well the one that that mr personality 

131.00 134.17 A: which is hosted by monica lewinsky of all people 

133.72 136.46 B: okay and what's that about [cough] 

135.02 136.33 A: (( yeah so )) 

136.91 147.93 A: it it's a dating it's a dating show but i guess the catch is that all the it's one woman and i think it starts with twenty guys the catch is all the guys have to wear masks 

147.36 149.19 B: oh okay 

148.83 150.16 A: so she has to d- 

150.35 153.53 A: she has to decide pick her her love 

153.85 157.16 A: based totally on on personality 

157.09 169.77 B: okay right okay that one i i that's the one i honestly when i s- i think i read when i read that no actually i saw a preview on t._v. and i i i thought it was like a a j- one of those joke commercials 

165.17 166.31 A: right 

169.74 172.07 A: yeah [laughter] yeah it kinda does 

170.55 171.43 B: 'cause 

171.79 182.40 B: yeah 'cause i'm like who who would on personality okay and then the guys wearing the mask is you know it's i i watch the nickelodeon channel and they have like junk cartoons about like the screamer box 

172.14 173.32 A: (( it kinda does )) 

175.18 176.28 A: right 

182.14 183.18 A: right 

182.49 186.42 B: so um like i'm thinking it's a commercial but it's actually going to be a new series 

186.10 189.04 A: yeah i i think it's already it's already started 

187.62 188.39 B: (( [cough] )) 

188.72 191.12 B: oh okay well probably they won't pick me 

191.09 192.31 A: [laughter] 

191.64 201.33 B: yeah well the guy better have a nice personality but let's see okay so we got survivor series bachelor bachelorette i think only one of them actually so called made it 

201.90 203.67 B: that was um [lipsmack] 

203.69 204.97 B: who was that guy 

205.37 210.07 B: god i have their face in front of me 'cause they've been all over the news the only ones that actually made it 

211.01 212.87 A: i mean in what sense 

211.05 211.94 B: god 

212.53 217.68 B: i'm sorry that that actually dated they're married they're supposed to i think they're supposed to get married 

216.44 219.15 A: oh yeah right i don't know which one 

218.15 223.02 B: ryan something ryan i think it's ryan and fisher no 

221.64 225.83 A: them i think that was the bachelorette one i think 

225.42 230.84 B: no no no no actually no isn't that the one where he was supposed to be a millionaire but he's really not that one 

226.44 227.21 A: no 

230.24 231.94 A: oh joe millionaire 

231.36 237.19 B: joe millionaire right that's that that show i mean that seems to be the only that actually had 

232.40 233.24 A: yeah 

237.34 240.48 B: well from what it seems still a happy ending 

240.50 241.45 B: and it's 

240.82 247.53 A: i i i didn't know that at all i know like he's been on like oprah and stuff [laughter] that that 

245.43 260.32 B: yeah and yeah no because they seem that they're supposed to looking into a million dollar home somewhere and they're talking about kids and they're still dating and they're it seems to still be [mn] that still be going on then they had that other o- the new one i think it is on or semi new 

260.34 262.17 B: (( that they meet the um [lipsmack] )) 

262.57 264.30 B: you have to meet the parents first 

264.93 266.54 A: yeah that's uh 

265.35 266.70 B: (( that your parents pick )) 

266.77 272.11 A: yeah and they have a lie detector and all that yeah that one's just mean [laughter] 

267.79 268.74 B: (( i don't know )) 

271.31 275.13 B: oh [laughter] well listen it beats that um what is it uh 

275.21 283.83 B: the the the show with simon and these are m- honestly i i don't watch t._v. but just from what i read and get on the internet they seem to just 

278.02 278.83 A: (( ameri- )) 

281.11 282.12 A: right 

284.41 287.66 B: ha- are finding just more waste of time on 

287.93 288.99 B: on the t._v. 

289.10 292.96 A: well it's like a i think it's a vicarious thrill to see people get 

293.31 304.18 A: you know it's kind of fun to watch people get you know made fun of and yelled at and embarrassed and and i think the fact that it is it's quote real makes it um 

305.66 307.14 B: much more entertaining 

306.73 318.51 A: yeah yeah i mean i i you know i i [mn] i don't know because i i re- really haven't watched i- more than like one episode of a couple of the shows but i can totally see how people really g- get into it 

307.88 308.94 B: yeah well 

315.90 316.99 B: (( [noise] )) 

319.42 330.71 B: right no that's what the like i said i [mn] like i think i quickly watched one survivor series to me it's just from the beginning it was just like a waste of time but you know 

329.64 330.62 A: (( right [noise] )) 

331.12 341.51 B: uh it's it's the talk of the town obviously 'cause everybody seems to be uh listening to it or um you're actually watching it a lot of people rush home just to watch it so [cough] to me it's 

341.66 343.65 B: i personally feel it's a waste of time but then 

343.67 346.02 B: i feel t._v. television's a waste of time 

346.17 347.72 B: that's why we have computers now 

347.75 358.27 A: right well there's still some decent stuff on there but i mean i think that's the probably the problem with reality t._v. too that it is so successful that the networks just keep doing it because it keeps working 

354.88 355.82 B: mhm 

358.90 362.31 A: and eventually i mean eventually people get sick and tired of it and 

362.46 364.32 A: it'll go back to 

365.29 368.25 B: to radio [laughter] [cough] 

366.65 375.07 A: ah no it won't go back to radio but i think it'll go back to more you know the way it used to be you know like sitcoms will always be around and and things like that but 

371.64 372.33 B: mhm 

372.69 373.66 B: yeah 

374.88 381.91 B: right but they have um okay so we see they got survivor from what i hear like i said there's survivor joe millionaire 

382.11 383.95 B: bachelorette i think it was or 

383.99 390.43 B: bachelor guy the one who w- i forgot the show where the guy picked the wrong girl they say he should have picked the other one 

390.70 394.50 B: because he ended up breaking up with just basically like a real soap opera 

394.33 395.55 A: (( right )) 

394.98 408.82 B: i forgot what the show was but it was basically w- well the same thing about um [lipsmack] it was the guy and he he was supposed to pick the girl and everybody stated that he was supposed to p- i think the girl's name was zena he was supposed to pick her because she really fell in love with him or something like that 

408.82 410.34 B: but again this is all 

410.36 414.17 B: i think the new the new show i think i'm going to have to actually watch 

410.74 411.47 A: huh 

413.89 414.98 A: right 

414.40 418.34 B: so that when i call up this topic line i'll actually know what i'm talking about [laughter] 

416.07 417.33 A: [laughter] 

417.65 418.78 A: [laughter] 

418.42 423.80 B: 'cause obviously you've watched a little more t._v. than i have [laughter] so i gotta see um c- 

421.14 422.10 A: right 

423.84 426.55 B: [mn] okay so what else would they have um 

426.95 427.87 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

427.47 437.09 A: well i think th- th- the thing that's kind of creepy now is like like it's the the dating shows are so popular and those are like things like survivor i mean i- i- it's a little different because it's 

438.01 443.68 A: you know it's it's sort of like you know it's competitive but it's there's like some fairness to it and like 

443.21 444.12 B: (( mm mhm )) 

444.03 451.27 A: like they're not setting people like joe millionaire like they set those poor people up like girls and like just lied to 'em for 

451.05 451.86 B: mhm 

451.64 456.66 A: you know and these people take like months out of their lives it's gotta take forever to film these things you know 

456.33 457.88 B: (( oh [lipsmack] definitely )) 

458.40 461.11 B: definitely no that i understand no 

461.17 462.39 B: but they have 

462.63 467.67 B: they have they have um [lipsmack] i forgot what it was um basically that's almost like fear factor 

467.86 469.14 B: it's almost like 

468.26 470.21 A: yeah that right 

469.38 472.60 B: f- like it's it's like a topic stuff 

473.02 474.83 B: it's like a topic um 

475.24 476.73 B: ba- basically not like 

475.63 476.24 A: (( [noise] )) 

476.82 479.11 B: that so called reality show but 

479.13 493.45 B: m- meeting for love and usually kind of reality show and like m- joe millionaire or bachelorette or you could have so called reality shows like um fear factor and survivor but they just throw a little extra in there to um i 

489.67 490.63 A: right 

493.77 498.80 B: guess break up the monotony i don't h- honestly like i said to me i i don't see a point in it 

498.81 501.67 B: but i mean if they're going on this survey for opinion 

501.90 503.39 B: (( bet they've figured ours )) 

502.10 503.02 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

503.22 504.89 A: [laughter] 

503.85 505.64 B: i'm sure they definitely got ours 

505.67 507.54 B: but uh no so let's see 

507.92 511.08 B: oh my god how much can you talk about reality shows 

507.99 508.73 A: (( okay )) 

511.26 515.41 A: ah i guess if you watch them a lot i'm sure people talk forever yeah i'm 

514.74 515.85 B: (( oh )) 

515.88 519.94 A: sure they have discussion boards and yeah 

519.23 519.81 B: (( m- )) 

519.92 520.84 B: right 

520.90 523.28 A: fan clubs and all sorts of stuff 

523.07 524.88 B: yeah well it's like i said they 

525.71 528.93 B: it's a a couple of people watch it i'm that they'll it 

529.16 534.55 B: it becomes a phase so then again eventually it's just like every other fad out there it's obviously just going to die out 

535.05 536.75 A: i i don't know about that i 

536.35 537.53 B: it well th- 

536.77 547.63 A: mean y- you know you i mean you have like game s- you know you know and i said you had game shows was a big fad for a while and everyone had a game show on a few years ago and now you have reality t._v. and yeah 

539.31 540.20 B: mhm 

547.00 550.17 B: right e- exactly but the game shows faded out 

550.13 551.04 A: right 

550.50 553.72 B: how many game shows now you have reruns family feud 

553.94 561.48 B: ah a couple of other ones but not [mn] not anything that's like back in those days i no reality show will be here for a while but 

561.59 563.62 B: like i say that eventually it will 

563.66 564.65 B: die out 

564.52 565.64 A: (( yeah i think so )) 

564.92 573.45 B: yeah well if we're lucky it will but um but then you know what they'll just come up with something new well yeah they'll definitely come up with something new what was that 

567.24 568.42 A: [laughter] 

574.31 578.14 B: but they have okay they said ten minutes and it's been more than ten minutes 

578.36 580.47 B: how much can you talk about reality shows 

580.26 581.31 A: [laughter] 

581.06 583.88 B: my god okay let's see um 

584.39 585.32 B: (( well ))
