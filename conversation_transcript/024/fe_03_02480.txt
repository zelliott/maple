88.67 91.32 A: and they're letting these uh 

91.54 100.87 A: whoever puts the thing on they let them pick out the rich guy and then they're going they're trying to get his money it's like jeeze ladies

101.54 103.21 A: no i 

102.23 104.06 B: no i don't like it it's like 

104.19 109.57 B: all those shows it's like i don't get it because they're so popular but to me it's not interesting 

109.99 116.61 A: no to me either because to me i- it's i don't know i- i- it's like a premade date but it's 

117.03 121.73 A: i don't know 'cause to me those are just money grabbers that are going for those guys 

119.66 121.37 B: yeah exactly 

121.68 128.81 B: yeah i was watching a little tiny bit of the uh bachelor show last night i just watched like the last five minutes 

128.61 129.61 A: uh-huh 

129.13 135.78 B: and this i guess the guy he's like a millionaire or something [mn] do do you watch that 

134.71 135.70 A: no 

135.78 147.36 B: and um he has a bunch of girls and he has to pick he he gets rid of one at a time that he doesn't like and this one girl she got kicked off and she was crying and was so upset and everything 

147.44 150.40 B: and i was like what that's just so stupid because 

150.29 151.45 B: you know she 

151.29 156.67 B: h- how can she like be in love with the guy or something you know it's just some guy that the producers have picked 

156.66 166.73 B: out and you know she's probably just known him for like a couple of weeks or something and she's all crying like he's the love of her life or something i'm sure she's just interested in his money 

166.96 172.85 A: i know and it's like he he must not have been interested or he wouldn't have gotten rid of her 

167.40 168.45 B: (( you know what i mean )) 

171.23 172.33 B: yeah 

172.31 178.17 B: i know and then it's like he he's and then they show the clip from next week's show or whatever and he was like 

178.15 192.01 B: kissing every one of them at different times and i'm like how could they be interested i mean they know he's like going off on a date with the other girl and making out with them whatever and then the next night it's the the next girl whatever [laughter] 

191.99 194.39 B: and they're all still interested in him 

194.44 196.20 B: so i guess it's for the money huh 

194.50 195.44 A: i know i 

196.48 205.34 A: it's gotta be because i mean i wouldn't wanna guy that's sitting there kissing on another fifteen girls in like the same week that he's kissing on me 

200.81 201.99 B: yeah 

204.16 215.02 B: yeah it's horrible huh [laughter] so i guess they uh they just want the money or or they just wanna win or whatever you know they don't want to be embarrassed on t._v. or whatever by 

206.19 208.42 A: [laughter] 

215.25 219.45 B: getting kicked off so they they're just acting like they really like him or whatever but 

215.50 216.72 A: yeah 

219.50 228.49 A: i know but i'm like you i think it's just the money and i think if he would happen to marry one of 'em i think he'd make 'em sign a prenuptial agreement 

225.10 226.02 B: yeah 

227.40 230.43 B: (( yeah and i'm sure it probably wouldn't last e- either )) 

229.98 240.63 A: [noise] and i bet they wouldn't want to marry him then well they might because they might be able keep him happy long enough to get some of his money you know get some jewellery 

232.97 233.91 B: yeah 

237.28 244.37 B: yeah [mn] yeah 'cause they probably wouldn't care really they'd be just running around with spending his money and not really [laughter] 

244.21 248.17 A: yeah i can see that [laughter] but 

244.63 246.71 B: having like a real marriage or anything 

246.94 249.73 B: but did you see that um one called um 

250.09 251.68 B: married by america 

252.37 253.49 A: what's it called 

253.18 255.04 B: married by america 

254.92 256.03 A: no 

255.59 258.80 B: it was it was really bad it was like they um 

258.84 265.19 B: they had these like five single people and then they had this other group of single people and they had um 

265.72 269.91 B: they picked like five people for each of the five singles you know 

270.10 271.51 B: and then um 

271.82 272.80 B: they 

272.90 286.65 B: their family and friends picked two out of those five so they were ba- basically left with a choice of two people for each si- each of the five singles and then um the five singles didn't get to see any of the people or meet them 

286.63 290.05 B: and then uh people had to call in on the phone [laughter] and um 

289.86 302.57 B: choose which one they liked the best you know what i mean so it was like america got to choose which one that they were going to end up with and then they had to actually propose to them on the show without even seeing them like propose to 'em through a screen 

295.57 297.34 A: oh you're kidding 

302.46 305.77 B: and then that was it they were engaged before they'd even met it 

305.81 307.03 A: you're kidding 

306.41 318.85 B: was crazy and i didn't watch the rest of it 'cause then i guess on the following weeks they showed 'em like living together and whether they got along or whatever but i didn't watch it i just saw that first one and i thought no this is terrible this is you know 

319.05 320.30 B: that's just so 

319.26 323.06 A: i mean that's even worse than the money hungry ladies 

321.67 327.78 B: yeah that's like just totally making a mockery of marriage really isn't it [laughter] it's like [laughter] 

326.63 332.69 A: well in a way it's similar to the way they do like in isn't in china or somewhere 

331.85 333.84 B: (( it's yeah i guess huh they )) 

333.26 337.06 A: they prearrange but then the families do that 

334.40 336.08 B: the arranged marriage 

336.20 344.79 B: yeah but this is like people calling in on a phone and dialing the eight hundred number or whatever [laughter] and saying okay this is the person you're going to marry [laughter] 

337.39 338.58 A: it's not 

344.80 353.10 B: and spend the rest of your life with so it's kind of crazy i just thought it was terrible like a i don't see how any of those marriages could last really 

353.38 357.52 A: i don't even understand how they could get married in the first place i mean 

356.47 357.99 B: yeah 

358.39 364.47 A: who would marry somebody they'd never met i mean i can understand if it was your custom and your country 

360.55 361.93 B: (( i kn- know )) 

364.27 370.62 B: yeah and like why are they doing it do you know what i mean i guess because they wanna be on t._v. and in probably 

369.49 372.01 A: i bet they don't actually get married 

371.63 372.69 B: yeah 

372.93 378.42 B: i bet they don't or if they do it's going to be terrible probably they're going to be 

378.54 381.17 B: (( you know it's not going to last it's going to be a big mistake )) 

381.72 383.03 A: yeah 

381.86 382.91 B: but um 

383.43 389.49 B: i'm sure there was a big money prize at the end of it or something as well because i don't see why else they would be doing it you know what i mean 

390.50 392.25 B: (( [laughter] it's )) 

390.93 395.46 A: [laughter] it's just so goofy i n- never even heard of that one i 

395.03 399.13 B: yeah you didn't miss anything trust me [laughter] 

395.73 398.07 A: i guess i don't watch enough computer 

398.23 401.79 A: i spend too much time on the computer so i don't watch enough t._v. 

400.61 411.28 B: yeah i don't watch any of these reality shows really i've seen like a i'll see like maybe half or a quarter of an episode of one 'em and i'm like oh my god this is terrible and then i change the channel you know
