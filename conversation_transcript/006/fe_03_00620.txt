235.66 240.31 A: that was always like the big blow out the last thing of summer before the kids started back to school 

240.89 241.37 B: right 

240.91 244.46 A: and my daughter's birthday is the twenty sixth of august and we always

283.48 283.95 B: uh-huh 

284.01 284.90 A: yeah i think so 

285.88 288.08 A: you're allowed to do it three times so i thought well 

288.21 289.06 A: it's worth trying 

288.91 289.88 B: eh and they might 

290.48 291.38 B: that's a pretty good coat 

291.82 292.15 B: yeah 

292.38 292.82 B: yeah 

292.92 293.20 B: i'll

314.21 318.23 A: i put in for ten between ten and midnight because my husband leaves at ten thirty and i thought well 

318.83 322.24 A: it was worth doing and we could use the extra money 

322.81 323.19 B: right 

323.37 325.94 A: i do all the surveys do you do the survey sites and everything 

326.81 327.97 B: uh

370.03 371.03 A: like um 

371.75 372.87 A: like drawings and stuff

389.10 390.76 B: and stuff like that 

391.37 394.14 B: but uh we were talking about holidays before 

394.14 394.49 A: uh-huh 

395.24 397.13 B: what if they had a world peace day 

397.32 398.21 B: what would you think of that 

397.40 399.52 A: that's what i was thinking if you had some kind of uh 

400.30 405.92 A: or like they even have like like i was going to say have a day where everybody's supposed to go volunteer something 

406.37 406.86 B: uh-huh 

406.75 413.62 A: and like your job would still pay you or something but it's like a volunteer day or som- i think that'd be neat have like world volunteer day or or 

411.00 411.41 B: right 

414.03 416.53 A: you know u._s. volunteer day or something 

416.92 417.95 B: that'd be pretty good 

417.10 417.74 A: and have like 

418.43 422.99 A: you know like have everybody is like your be your business if you could get them to participate 

423.36 428.69 A: but they would still pay you but you're supposed to go volunteer but i guess uh some people would probably try to 

429.55 432.74 A: not volunteer and get paid anyways and say they did or something but 

429.79 430.21 B: well 

433.06 435.94 A: i think that'd be neat to have like uh volunteer day 

436.42 438.98 B: i think you know when a country was founded 

439.17 440.88 B: actually public service was 

441.01 441.78 B: a freebie 

442.37 445.87 B: you know a lot of people didn't get paid now now it's become uh 

446.93 448.39 B: uh uh trough 

449.61 450.32 B: you know what i mean 

452.11 455.31 A: yeah i try to volunteer my time like my kids school and everything 

452.13 452.69 B: so 

456.31 461.58 B: well that's a good you know well you have a reason you know incentive cause your kids are there and uh 

462.18 463.96 B: you know you can help out and everything 

464.77 465.35 A: yeah i try to 

464.78 465.90 B: i don't have any kids 

466.20 466.97 A: well 

466.31 466.68 B: so i 

468.21 468.70 B: so 

469.80 473.62 B: um i'm thinking about doing it cause i'm getting older i need something to do 

474.25 475.72 B: i'm out of work right now 

476.69 478.43 B: but uh i've been looking for 

477.53 480.43 A: if you like kids it's really neat i i love kids 

481.14 481.63 B: yeah 

481.24 486.07 A: and like we have um bible release time here where the kids can get out of school 

486.64 488.56 A: for an hour once a week 

489.39 494.08 A: and i volunteer with that to help the kids learn about the religion and everything 

494.71 495.33 B: right 

495.27 498.55 A: and i think that's important because there's a lot of the kids that don't go to church 

500.03 500.79 A: but i mean even 

500.10 500.73 B: yeah 

500.94 503.73 A: uh you probably have big brothers and big sisters out there 

505.12 508.36 B: yeah i've done some charity fund raising 

509.19 510.76 B: but it was for pay 

511.55 512.12 B: you know 

512.46 513.34 B: uh 

513.51 515.72 B: for special olympics hal 

516.50 520.12 B: uh feed the homeless a coalition for the homeless 

520.57 524.12 B: and or the people donate food and stuff 

525.43 526.30 B: and 

526.98 527.64 B: that was 

527.74 528.80 B: that was satisfying 

529.50 533.14 B: you know doing something for somebody you're getting paid too you know 

534.12 539.80 A: my stuff i don't get paid for but i enjoy it anyhow i think i get as much out of it as the kids do and 

540.60 543.14 A: i mean i do a lot of stuff like for people like i 

543.32 547.52 A: try to help my dad's older and i try to help him make sure he has food and everything and 

547.17 548.93 B: right 

548.48 551.36 A: i do a lot of stuff for other people try to help people out 

551.40 552.72 B: right 

553.04 556.52 A: but i think that'd be neat have uh like uh some kind of volunteer day or something 

556.54 557.57 B: (( )) 

556.84 558.82 A: i know they have like that that health day 

558.95 559.22 A: that 

559.89 561.90 A: they run in the newspaper do you know what i mean like 

562.42 566.94 A: it's national (( )) it's like it's not big help day i don't think i think that's on nickelodeon
