307.77 311.56 A: yeah your holiday sounds pretty good i guess that um 

312.25 315.40 A: i was thinking of that movie uh did you ever watch that 

317.28 326.44 A: [noise] oh what was that one that where where they actually combined christmas and halloween [noise] the nightmare before the nightmare before christmas 

323.22 324.49 B: (( no )) 

326.38 330.21 B: oh no i've heard of that but i never saw it no 

329.30 337.23 A: now that would for me because when you started talking about christmas yeah christmas is because you get together with your family 

336.99 338.23 B: mhm 

337.44 344.18 A: and and you know like i got all my brothers and sisters are grown and my parents are still alive so 

344.21 350.38 A: um you know and and and kicking [laughter] so we always sort of 

347.76 348.94 B: (( oh [mn] )) 

351.15 353.41 A: all converge 

351.81 352.93 B: (( oh you go there )) 

353.48 360.22 A: yeah my father was a math professor at b._g._s._u. in bowling green so he's retired now 

358.32 359.61 B: oh 

359.89 363.57 B: so if you could kinda combine christmas and halloween 

362.79 369.02 A: yeah that would be my it 'cause i need to have all i don't know i kinda i'm kind of a a 

369.13 372.72 A: i'm not a spooky person but i like to be scared 

370.75 376.21 B: so its' gonna be a religious spooky holiday with all kinds of candy and 

375.16 387.17 A: yeah and presents to open it would be like 'cause i mean there there is no doubt that even i'm almost forty i i mean i i still enjoy going to my parents house and they always get us 

387.06 391.16 A: they always get everybody gifts you know so um 

389.05 390.17 B: yeah 

391.70 405.17 A: and most of the time now that my sister and brother and i are all grown we pick out our gifts but but every year they they they surprise us with something that wasn't on our list or you know and so 

401.82 402.93 B: mhm 

405.09 411.65 A: ideally i guess that but that movie just when you said christmas and i said halloween that movie sort of uh 

413.41 416.86 B: but then you'd have to go trick or treating in the snow 

413.52 414.67 A: [noise] sort 

415.05 416.18 A: (( [noise] )) 

416.24 420.32 A: well you wouldn't have to go trick or treating i guess you could you know um 

421.35 422.19 A: uh 

421.92 423.57 B: well if you get snow 

422.43 423.97 A: i spent um 

424.23 429.02 A: part of my when i was in college i spent a year in nova scotia canada 

427.86 429.92 B: oh my word yeah 

429.38 431.60 A: and they have a they have a 

432.44 439.64 A: [noise] guys i'm on the phone they have a a holiday that happens every new year where [noise] they actually dress up 

439.67 441.22 A: and uh 

440.26 441.59 B: mhm 

441.66 444.08 A: and go out and um 

444.35 459.28 A: not beg for money but they go from door to door in costumes on new year's eve and it's like a tradition in canada and i can't remember what it was [mn] but i remember going with the people i was staying with and that was sort of a combination of like halloween and uh 

459.19 466.84 A: and and the christmas season so it was like to celebrate the new year and people would go out and and 

461.05 462.09 B: uh-huh 

466.03 469.68 B: (( that sounds sounds kinda different [cough] )) 

467.09 468.06 A: and y- 

468.34 477.55 A: yeah so and i mean every it wasn't just like them playing a trick on me 'cause i was i mean lots of people were out doing this so but uh 

475.40 476.64 B: mhm 

478.00 484.82 A: so i was just thinking that that was a a combination of the halloween christmasy thing the don't really celebrate 

485.06 486.83 A: [noise] too much 

487.16 488.17 B: uh-huh 

487.90 492.33 A: up there the way uh we celebrate down here believe it or not so 

492.52 494.31 A: anyways you talk for a while 

494.11 499.81 B: oh what am i gonna say i was thinking if you combined those two holidays together you'd have to have like a 

495.21 495.83 A: (( [mn] )) 

500.43 504.55 B: santa claus in a different in a halloween costume and and 

503.77 504.90 A: (( [cough] ))

506.93 509.70 A: excuse me i'm sorry yeah 

508.46 511.82 B: and what else what else well you know you gotta do 

510.04 511.23 A: (( mhm ))

515.42 517.56 A: oh i'm catholic too 

517.19 518.51 B: oh yeah 

518.04 531.21 A: that's probably why i like halloween 'cause it's so against every i mean not that i'm against catholicism believe me i'm a very i'm a very religious person i'm very staunch but i mean it's that one time a year where you know 

531.08 545.38 A: you kinda let that whole all those beliefs sort of fly out the window because you don't believe in ghosts and you don't believe in you know it's supposed to be [noise] against the church and stuff i mean and it's just a chance once a year to 

532.52 533.75 B: let that pass 

541.80 543.21 B: yeah 

543.91 545.97 B: kind of a druid thing 

545.62 554.46 A: yeah where you're just like okay this is obviously a national holiday thing going on here so well i don't even know is halloween even considered a holiday
