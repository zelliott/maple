44.07 46.57 A: my favorite holiday is christmas 

47.64 58.10 A: and i'll tell you why um christmas is my favorite holiday because um i am a christian and i do believe in christ jesus and um 

58.83 62.30 A: um i am saved um so i just 

63.24 65.73 A: think christmas is a celebration of his birth 

79.87 82.43 A: after sometimes not seeing him the whole year 

82.72 86.15 A: we're able to come together it gives the opportunity to give gifts 

86.34 92.59 A: plus i have three small children who really enjoy getting gifts 

92.13 94.09 B: right 

92.75 96.87 A: you know they really enjoy um you know the christmas story 

95.57 98.98 B: just as long as they understand why you're celebrating 

103.67 108.27 A: you know i hate for it to be considered pagan you know just the shopping 

119.81 130.90 A: and everything and um but that's pretty much why it's my favorite one because um i have christmas all year long really because of you know my religion of christianity 

143.93 147.94 A: i am right now i will create the holiday of 

148.40 149.49 A: of um 

150.01 161.62 A: in remembrance of september the eleventh i think um that would be a holiday uh should be i don't know what they would call it maybe because we already have a memorial day 

152.78 153.75 B: that would be nice 

161.40 161.97 B: mhm 

161.78 170.98 A: for the um um veterans and everything but um i would make that a holiday in remembrance of uh the destruction that happened on that day too 

171.44 175.18 A: uh thousands and touched you know billions of lives basically 

175.73 178.18 A: so i think that would be a um 

178.33 183.47 A: a holiday for rest and for people not to have to go into work and just a time for peace 

183.64 192.35 A: you know a time to to think on you know how can we change as a society to bring about more more peace among each other 

189.07 189.74 B: right 

192.44 194.63 A: you know rather then war 

194.65 196.16 B: well that's a really good idea 

196.04 197.71 A: mhm 

197.42 203.76 B: you must be perfect for this thing because i'm drawing such blanks 

202.38 209.65 A: well you know i'm a talker i'm a conversationalist so um 

205.33 208.13 B: well normally i am but 

208.40 213.14 B: it's got to be something that i don't know this was just kind of a surprise uh

218.78 220.10 A: okay but um 

220.27 222.47 A: do you have any holiday that you enjoy

230.32 231.62 A: that big 

230.39 231.59 B: specific one i 

231.77 232.97 B: focus on 

231.77 234.58 A: sticks out other more then the other got you 

235.05 235.89 A: well um if 

235.50 237.56 B: mean don't get me wrong uh 

238.03 241.09 B: like you said christmas is a wonderful holiday and 

240.39 240.95 A: right 

241.53 245.15 B: as long as you keep in mind the reason that we are celebrating it yes 

245.58 246.18 A: i 

245.71 247.07 B: because some people do 

247.38 249.76 B: just make it a retail holiday 

249.50 251.02 A: exactly i think it has 

250.28 252.44 B: but they do that with all of that anymore 

252.51 254.89 A: i think it has left its uh 

255.85 263.06 A: i think it has left it's basically it's purpose now really i the holidays to be honest 

263.16 267.39 A: um have come from i don't really understand paganism 

267.49 273.57 A: um came from people just celebrating certain things that had nothing to do with religion 

273.54 274.14 B: right 

273.79 281.79 A: so they made up all of these different holidays um as far as far as christmas i've heard different things about the christmas tree why do we give presents 

287.86 291.29 A: my own personal reason for celebrating that time 

291.44 296.10 A: is not so that i can shop because i usually don't have the money to shop like that to be honest 

295.34 296.20 B: oh yes 

296.56 300.57 A: so that's definitely not the purpose and it actually really 

314.99 316.18 B: (( )) 

331.80 333.94 A: celebrate christmas because of a santa claus 

340.04 342.06 A: i'm just being truthful with them that 

342.02 344.12 B: so you never let them believe in santa claus 

342.36 342.85 A: you know 

343.86 344.48 A: yeah 

345.10 345.78 A: excuse me 

345.97 347.77 B: you never let them believe in santa clause 

347.17 349.10 A: mhm no ma'am mhm 

349.05 354.45 B: well there's nothing wrong with that i mean it it just kind of alters things because it's it's more for 

349.21 349.83 A: um 

354.94 355.65 A: children 

354.97 355.47 B: um 

355.72 356.81 B: right right 

355.77 359.60 A: yeah yeah um i don't i don't believe that 

359.90 361.34 A: um it's really 

361.84 373.31 A: i mean my husband kind of talks about it a little bit but my i'm pretty much firm on it i'm not going to you know give you anything make believe on that even on easter i'm not 

373.67 375.01 A: get into the easter bunny 

375.40 376.34 A: you know i don't 

376.35 377.05 B: right 

376.63 378.29 A: get into all this 

377.62 380.06 B: don't take away the reason for it 

379.95 388.93 A: yeah i don't get into the easter bunny i don't get into and i don't tell them their is an easter bunny i basically tell them about the resurrection of christ 

389.39 395.08 A: and this is the reason we celebrate them now i don't keep them from going easter egg hunting or anything 

394.89 396.02 B: right 

395.41 407.26 A: you know but and and even as far as uh christmas i don't keep them from watching cartoons but i try to keep it more on the real basis but um 

407.84 408.23 A: i just 

408.31 409.35 A: never serve 

409.47 415.21 A: (( )) purpose of have you know telling them about santa clause because you know usually they know and 

418.53 419.49 B: right 

421.33 424.42 A: get into that now you know my husband will tell them 

424.67 430.33 A: you know look you know and he may we might even write him a little note that says from santa but pretty much they know that 

430.63 431.69 A: really there's no santa 

432.06 432.61 B: right 

432.09 434.73 A: you know but this is just part of what we do 

435.04 443.97 A: around christmas or what people do around christmas but this sis not a foundation this is just added to make fun so you guys can enjoy your holiday 

443.84 444.34 B: right 

444.28 444.79 A: but 

444.91 446.52 A: we don't get into 

446.81 451.79 A: you know the seriousness because when i coming up i really did think there was a santa clause because they was so 

451.92 460.43 A: devout about telling us about santa clause more so then they told us about a jesus so i never really understood the reason for christmas i thought it was gifts santa clause bringing us gifts 

460.80 461.28 B: right 

461.45 466.93 A: and i just don't want that to be my children's idea and and understanding about christmas 

467.46 470.97 A: you know but i don't i don't (( )) go crazy yes 

471.54 479.70 A: you know they hear santa clause or whatever or you know if my husband mention it to them because they know the real truth about christmas is to celebrate christ's birthday 

480.03 482.43 A: i mean everything else just added is just 

482.65 483.79 A: you know man made 

484.28 488.38 A: to have a to kind of you know bring a little spice and enjoy christmas 

488.39 488.92 B: right 

488.84 489.53 A: mhm 

489.64 492.05 A: but um like i said even for easter i don't 

492.36 499.07 A: i don't get into the easter bunny we don't get into the dressing up thing and going to church i mean if we don't go the rest of the year we're not going 

499.37 503.72 A: you know on easter either you know but 

500.12 501.08 B: right 

501.20 501.82 B: right 

503.10 506.45 B: right i i understand that to because i think that's kind of uh 

507.01 509.38 B: a fake thing i mean you don't have to 

508.35 508.79 A: yeah 

509.91 512.80 B: um go there to believe 

512.42 515.22 A: yeah that's true that's actually true 

513.19 518.96 B: just going to that building doesn't make you a believer and there's lots of people that go there 

517.03 518.10 A: no it doesn't 

519.40 521.57 B: and aren't but you know but that
