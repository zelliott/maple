8.76 12.27 A: as far as the security i'm not real sure i've never flown before 

15.26 21.56 B: um i don't think it's a bad idea to have heightened security but i i'm not sure 

21.98 22.36 B: that 

22.64 25.79 B: it will go all the way to stop any terrorist attacks 

26.06 27.17 A: no i don't either 

27.38 28.61 A: i believe there's ways 

29.60 31.77 A: for them to get in there no matter what you do 

31.83 34.88 B: right and i don't think they'll try the same thing again 

35.11 36.84 A: no they won't do that um 

37.72 39.38 A: i'm not sure really what they they 

39.90 42.29 A: but nobody was expecting what they had planned 

43.18 43.56 B: right 

43.74 44.16 A: so 

43.94 52.45 B: right and i think that it if there is another terrorist attack i think it definitely will be in a different way totally and in a way i think 

53.11 59.13 B: you know it was like a knee jerk reaction right after nine one one that they focused on airports 

59.91 63.04 A: that's right it sh- it should have been focused on before 

63.83 67.02 A: with some of the little things that had happened and gone on and 

69.07 71.60 B: well there are a lot of other areas too um 

72.48 74.74 B: you no ah um we have um 

75.31 77.39 B: ships coming in and out of harbors 

78.59 80.29 B: uh you know throughout the country 

80.61 85.88 B: we have trucks coming across the border from other countries and i don't know whether they're really 

85.99 86.40 B: you know 

86.84 90.42 B: checking those the same way they check people at airports 

90.62 93.66 A: right like the (( )) and things that people are taking in 

95.41 101.44 A: you're right they hadn't mentioned any any kind of security that they may have taken security for anything else other than the air flights 

101.66 104.69 B: and there are a lot of products that come in that could be 

105.23 107.83 B: you know like food products that they could 

108.11 114.86 B: some how get to and put a some kind of germ warfare kind of stuff i don't really know that much about that kind of stuff but 

114.54 116.25 A: i don't neither it's like the 

116.40 117.55 A: the anthrax that 

117.86 122.00 A: nobody was expecting that either not that it was the same kind of thing going on but 

123.10 125.20 A: nonetheless it could be on world wide and 

126.49 127.74 A: wiped out a lot of people 

127.75 128.17 B: right 

128.35 133.50 B: and i wa- if i was going to fly which i mostly don't because my husband doesn't like to fly 

134.46 137.71 B: but if i was going to you know 

134.78 135.42 A: (( )) 

137.80 138.80 B: i'm sure it would be 

139.00 146.70 B: pretty much of a nuisance to put up with all the security at the airport but i guess it's just something we have to deal with right now 

146.65 147.36 A: right oh 

147.52 148.37 A: my mother just took 

148.52 148.91 A: flight 

149.27 150.05 A: to california 

152.09 152.86 A: (( security )) (( was up )) 

153.23 154.81 A: but it was more or less like they were just 

155.28 158.42 A: trying to look like they were doing it and just wasting the time 

159.20 159.54 A: than 

160.12 160.78 A: actually 

161.09 162.24 A: going through everything 

162.24 165.06 B: wow and i think i heard on a news report just 

165.72 167.72 B: in the last couple of days that they might 

167.80 169.17 B: start weighing people 

169.45 173.86 A: yeah i read that too ah i've seen it on the c._n._n. web site today 

174.00 175.35 A: where they were talking about that 

174.08 174.44 B: yeah 

175.72 183.03 B: yeah if they weighed me and then compared me with what i told them on my driver's license i'd be in big trouble 

181.51 182.33 A: right 

182.83 186.54 A: me too wel- a which i would think most of us would be 

183.52 185.21 B: so th- i i 

186.61 187.74 B: right i didn't 

188.12 193.84 B: i heard the headline but i didn't see the actual report so i don't know how they were going to do that or why 

194.16 195.29 A: well uh 

195.58 198.94 A: i'm i'm from south carolina and they (( hadn't been long we had a )) 

199.80 200.99 A: crash maybe 

201.17 203.82 A: maybe sixty miles from me uh the charlotte 

204.17 204.79 A: airline 

205.56 207.90 A: where it hadn't took off but they were saying that 

208.33 209.16 A: it was heavy 

210.53 211.08 A: and 

210.74 211.70 B: oh that's right 

211.83 215.31 A: and the news report that i read is eh eh it was more or less 

215.45 218.51 A: from around here and they were going back to their airlines and 

219.57 220.55 A: saying that maybe that 

220.67 221.38 A: why but the 

221.90 223.61 A: teachers that they brought up were those 

223.95 226.58 A: people that got killed they didn't look heavy at all 

227.30 227.55 A: but 

227.84 231.08 A: it was also some bags that they had put on the airliner 

232.05 234.07 A: that the pilot had agreed to 

234.51 236.23 A: and actually i think they were 

236.62 237.32 A: overweight 

237.67 240.35 A: it it took on more weight than it was suppose to have 

240.64 242.20 B: well sounds to me like that 

242.33 243.87 B: um news report 

244.81 253.75 B: they made it sound on the station i listened to like it was something that would be done to you know because of the threat of terrorism but it sounds more 

254.11 260.11 B: from what you're saying like it had something to do with you know overloading planes and you know 

255.86 256.38 A: like 

259.89 260.20 A: yeah 

260.89 261.53 A: (( )) 

262.25 264.66 A: i'm not saying if it was nationwide but that's the way 

264.88 265.37 A: you know 

266.54 268.70 A: here that's the way it led me to believe that 

268.82 269.98 A: talking about you know 

270.46 273.29 A: a lot of them that pick up and then crash because it didn't 

273.98 279.84 A: it just picked up and flew right into the hangar it took sharp left turn and just flew right into the hangar 

287.96 288.41 A: yeah 

290.76 291.40 B: terrorism 

292.94 293.34 A: yeah 

295.51 296.17 A: no and 

296.61 297.80 A: i don't see how the weight 

297.92 298.38 A: you know 

298.83 299.67 A: be an issue with 

299.77 300.89 A: terrorism unless they're 

301.71 303.39 A: they would have to be carrying something 

305.21 305.65 B: well 

305.79 306.25 A: eh 

306.87 308.62 A: i guess there's ways they could 

308.79 311.73 A: according to their clothes and everything that they would wear 

308.87 309.78 B: i guess 

312.06 313.27 B: well you said that 

313.40 314.77 B: eh did you say your mother 

315.08 315.62 A: my mother 

315.54 317.19 B: flew um 

317.35 321.64 B: and she said it was more like just a joke that the people were going through he motions 

321.13 325.82 A: yeah she said eh it was just like they they were told they had to do it 

326.78 327.22 B: (( )) 

327.51 330.26 B: we've heard so many reports of um 

330.47 338.01 B: breeches of security at the airport like recently i think i remember they said one of the um bag checkers was asleep 

338.25 338.60 A: yeah 

338.74 342.08 B: so they had to call everybody back and start over again 

342.70 345.04 B: so it does sound like it's really not 

345.84 347.55 A: (( )) that they need us at their s- 

346.47 348.69 B: the the people aren't taking it seriously 

348.50 349.91 A: they need to put their s- 

350.01 351.83 A: security through more training and 

352.18 354.15 A: make them understand exactly what 

355.36 357.66 A: what could happen and what is happening around them 

357.94 361.08 B: right i know they're paying them more than they use to 

360.71 361.69 A: that's right i 

361.45 365.62 B: they got rid of a lot of them and they were suppose to have trained them better 

366.80 368.06 B: and paid them more 

368.74 369.86 B: you know more money 

369.92 370.25 A: yeah 

370.72 371.41 B: but it doesn't 

370.78 372.74 A: i know around here you see 

373.14 374.46 A: well right after terrorist 

374.59 376.25 A: attacks happened and even now 

376.91 380.52 A: you'll see the national guard some of the national guard will be there at the airport 

380.76 381.29 B: wow 

381.55 385.92 A: it and now that you said that i i wonder if it's more for show 

386.82 387.81 B: i don't know i haven't 

387.19 388.61 A: or the news cameras or 

389.22 390.91 A: or whatever 

390.34 396.27 B: i haven't flown lately but i do ah on occasion take people to and from the airport and 

392.17 392.58 A: yeah 

396.76 399.13 B: but i haven't been there for the last few months 

399.54 399.97 A: i use 

399.62 403.73 B: i guess because most of my friends haven't really flown much since nine one one 

404.10 404.52 A: yeah 

404.62 405.02 A: um 

405.33 405.75 A: (( well )) 

406.62 408.30 A: when that crash happened here rec- 

408.48 410.60 A: well i know there was a man that just lived in n- 

410.76 411.18 A: county 

413.15 413.44 A: it 

413.90 416.41 A: his job was was in sales and 

417.23 418.78 A: he said after that he said 

418.90 419.16 A: (( )) 

419.95 425.96 A: the w- his way of thinking about flying he said he's thinking more or less just renting cars and he would rather just take the drive than 

426.88 430.82 A: he said because eh if it's not with the airline he said you're scared of the terrorist 

426.89 427.36 B: wow 

430.95 432.02 A: attacks he said and what 

432.12 433.50 A: what may be going on and 

434.14 436.87 A: he said you don't know who to trust and you don't you don't know if 

437.50 438.46 A: person you're sitting ne- 

439.86 441.35 A: you know they may be friendly but 

441.91 443.63 A: then again going to shoot you in the head 

444.91 445.34 B: right 

445.46 449.64 B: you don't know and you don't know you know if you decide not to take a plane 

450.64 453.90 B: and you're going to drive you don't know when you're heading over that 

454.02 456.05 B: big long bridge where ever you are 

455.36 456.06 A: they yeah 

456.46 458.30 B: that they're not going to blow up that bridge 

458.25 461.57 A: that's right eh it's everywhere and it could be anywhere 

462.79 463.89 B: that's for sure 

464.10 464.66 A: that's it's 

464.92 469.03 B: eh and i think people you know they were more aware of everything 

469.60 470.54 B: a year ago 

471.27 475.92 B: eh and people aren't so aware now american people forget things very quickly 

475.76 477.46 A: they do and and they just 

477.67 478.25 A: tend to 

478.60 481.12 A: they go on and then when something else drastic happ- 

481.61 482.65 A: shock to them again 

482.94 483.29 B: right 

483.20 483.53 A: which 

483.89 485.50 A: i'm probably the same way i would 

485.78 487.42 B: well i'm sure we all are 

486.31 486.64 A: i 

487.53 489.47 B: i know i did things differently 

490.32 493.27 B: uh i carried my cell phone more with me 

493.47 496.39 B: where eh before that i tended to leave it in the car 

496.55 497.90 A: i do that to and 

497.66 500.86 B: you know if i'm going in and out of you know grocery shopping and that 

501.78 509.52 B: you know for awhile right after i was more aware of that more aware of making sure i knew where everybody in my family was 

509.79 512.53 B: you know in case we needed to get in touch with each other 

512.70 513.18 A: right 

513.36 514.48 A: me too and 

514.10 516.51 B: anyhow we do slack off but 

516.91 519.41 B: i don't know as far as the airports go
