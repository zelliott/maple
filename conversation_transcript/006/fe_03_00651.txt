385.57 386.22 B: yeah 

387.08 387.82 B: um

458.09 459.05 A: which is kind of a 

459.75 460.73 A: a small town 

461.36 463.62 B: it's kind of nice to be in a small town once in a while 

463.40 468.39 A: yeah well i'm close enough to orlando and close enough to gainesville and tampa to be able to 

468.49 468.92 A: you know

478.60 478.92 A: so 

479.20 483.78 B: one thing that surprised me is that the security at the mall of america hasn't changed much 

483.93 484.61 A: oh really 

484.68 485.11 B: no 

485.40 485.93 B: huh-uh 

485.94 486.41 A: huh 

486.85 489.36 B: you'd think they would've beefed that up a little bit but no 

488.64 490.52 A: is that your big mall there 

490.22 490.64 B: yeah 

491.09 494.15 B: yeah that's in bloomington near the airport

503.35 503.82 A: yeah 

504.21 505.86 A: because i know that i've had like 

507.14 511.57 A: sent things to young america minnesota and i wondered if maybe that was 

509.05 509.63 B: yup 

511.80 512.25 A: you know 

512.58 519.38 A: some kind of huge place that yo- has probably come under more security now and what have you since the mail system is 

519.72 521.69 A: is all so screwed up 

521.52 522.10 B: uh 

522.57 523.49 B: yeah i don't know 

523.58 524.89 B: i don't know if it's um 

525.92 526.29 A: hm 

525.99 527.28 B: changed there or not 

527.41 530.10 A: ten minutes is a long time 

530.40 531.74 B: um 

531.94 536.49 B: kind of i'm just trying to 

537.44 542.16 B: well and they say you don't have to stick to the topic so uh what's the weather like down there right now 

539.67 540.24 A: right 

542.54 548.22 A: oh right now it's it's been we had a real cold (( nap )) and we got quite low like around twenty 

548.38 548.95 B: okay 

548.89 550.27 A: uh at nighttime 

550.67 551.24 A: uh it's 

551.72 558.40 A: it's back up the temperatures are are hanging right around sixty during the day and i'll tell you it's going to dip back down into 

558.54 560.90 A: the high twenties but the rest of the week is 

561.13 562.91 A: it should be in the thirties at night 

563.82 567.42 A: so it's been one of the colder winters we've had in probably about ten years
