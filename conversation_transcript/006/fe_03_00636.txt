3.88 4.57 A: hi 

5.78 8.54 A: um i think trustworthiness is the most important

9.56 12.96 B: i absolutely agree trustworthy and honesty 

12.27 13.18 A: yes 

14.23 19.09 A: um i think that if you have that as the foundation everything else falls into place 

19.19 20.28 B: that's right it does 

20.48 23.05 B: it certainly does i'm actually divorced 

23.27 23.77 B: um 

24.21 26.21 B: for eight years now and 

26.34 28.10 B: that's exactly what fell apart 

28.71 30.60 B: in my marriage was the trust 

30.95 39.58 B: you know was gone and he you know strayed away from me um but now actually eight years later we are better friends then we ever were 

39.81 43.64 B: um the trust was regained but on a friendship lever because it was 

44.62 46.05 B: actually too difficult to 

46.14 47.89 B: to give um 

48.37 59.97 B: you know something like that to each other 

60.20 63.67 B: you know as far as him straying away from the marriage 

63.81 64.50 A: right 

63.84 65.58 B: so trust definitely is 

65.89 67.97 B: you know a major factor in a life partner 

67.99 68.60 A: yeah 

69.12 71.34 B: so are you single or married or 

71.11 72.00 A: engaged 

71.86 75.41 B: uh-huh good for you good for you you how old are you 

75.67 76.43 A: thirty one 

76.41 85.29 B: uh-huh and i'm i'm forty so and i got married kind of young i was uh twenty one i was married and by the time i was twenty seven i had three kids 

78.38 78.84 A: yeah 

85.40 91.66 B: you know so we were married about a year and a half when i found out i was pregnant with our first one and actually the first 

91.91 94.04 B: you know the first thing is about marriage is 

94.15 96.49 B: was wonderful it was really great 

96.14 96.57 A: yup 

96.64 98.01 B: but um you know it's it's 

98.21 103.79 B: like i said the trust went away it was simply he wasn't honest with himself 

103.92 105.59 B: you know and um 

105.82 109.99 B: so so so him not to be honest with himself made it a difficult then 

110.12 112.27 B: be honest with me or with anyone else 

111.78 112.57 A: oh okay 

112.48 114.17 B: so but you know it was it was 

114.41 116.57 B: regained which is nice you know because 

116.78 120.81 B: we have three kids together and our friendship now is 

120.95 129.76 B: absolutely wonderful there's trust there and honesty now it's unfortunate it couldn't last you know in the marriage but i'm glad we were able to you know remain 

130.04 135.69 B: friends you know it's tough the first two or three years because again like we said the trust issue is 

136.02 142.70 B: totally broken and you know it it hurt me a lot and then it took a lot of my own self growth and trust within my 

142.82 147.43 B: self i mean you know first to know that i can be strong and 

147.52 153.83 B: as a woman and as a mother you know to my kids so i've needed to trust myself again and i did and 

153.95 155.59 B: you know then i was able to 

155.77 158.86 B: you know if he was willing to make changes in his own 

159.00 163.23 B: personal life and he did you know i was able to gain a friendship with him that was 

163.40 166.31 B: you know completely different then then what marriage was
