118.77 120.55 A: oh i'm so sorry to hear that 

120.97 122.38 B: and um 

122.58 124.38 B: i met my husband in college 

124.83 125.45 B: we 

126.40 129.68 B: i don't know got along very well he was old enough to buy me beer 

129.94 135.11 A: well there you go that's uh th- you got to like that when you're in college right 

134.09 136.91 B: isn't that terrible to say but 

135.85 141.21 A: n- no i think at that age that's the greatest thing that's what we're all looking for 

141.07 143.51 B: he was twenty two and i was twenty 

144.32 144.85 B: um 

145.70 147.86 B: we were both looking i mean not 

148.01 151.17 B: not actively looking at that age so much but 

152.35 153.95 B: we started 

154.10 156.88 B: co-habitating about two months after we met 

156.97 158.55 A: wow that was fast 

158.38 159.73 B: um and then we were 

161.04 162.98 B: planning to get married the next year 

163.20 164.38 B: in september 

164.94 166.06 B: and i 

167.89 169.06 B: found out i was pregnant 

169.18 175.71 B: so we m- moved up the wedding date and we that was in april of nineteen ninety five and we've been married ever since 

171.50 172.11 A: right 

176.17 176.76 A: great 

176.81 180.09 B: um we just have personalities that mesh 

180.69 181.56 B: we couldn't 

183.40 186.02 B: we couldn't mar- be married to anyone else 

185.82 186.43 A: really 

186.16 187.14 B: to anyone else 

187.58 188.48 A: well that's great 

187.62 187.94 B: just 

188.35 189.38 B: does that make sense 

189.60 191.22 A: good for y- yes it does make sense 

191.25 195.54 B: we're both s- i don't want to say slovenly people but i mean 

195.66 196.59 B: eh uh hm 

197.10 201.25 B: how do i say this nicely he doesn't like to pick up i don't like to pick up 

201.50 202.26 B: i i mean eh 

202.74 204.45 B: now i'm sounding like i'm terribly 

204.37 214.86 A: no you're not because i can imagine that it would be difficult to be in a marriage where the one person is exceptionally a clean freak and the other one leaves the socks laying around 

214.39 215.35 B: mhm and 

214.99 217.03 A: that would be a lot of stress 

216.34 222.68 B: and prior to marry or prior to seeing him i dated someone like that just like that and it was very stressful 

222.84 224.06 A: yeah it has to create 

223.06 225.69 B: nothing was ever good enough and nothing was ever right 

225.50 233.89 A: it has to create a lot of stress i have a girlfriend whose very much a control freak she's a clean freak and she's recently married well 

234.15 236.46 A: couple years now her hus- was her 

236.61 241.64 A: her second husband it's it was his first marriage she's ten years older and 

249.47 249.95 B: mhm 

249.92 256.49 A: and she's one of these you can take a white glove in her houses at any given time you know day or night with no notice 

256.59 257.28 A: and 

257.87 260.50 A: it must be really difficult if you're not 

260.80 261.63 A: in the same 

261.80 262.77 A: mind set 

262.88 269.68 A: as someone like that because i couldn't live with her as much as i love her you know i i i couldn't live with someone like that 

266.51 267.05 B: mhm 

269.94 274.93 B: but yet then again we also get into many arguments because of the fact that we're so much alike 

275.55 276.41 A: okay 

276.38 278.16 B: we are both only children 

278.39 279.13 A: okay 

279.00 279.52 B: we are both 

279.62 281.38 B: very use to getting our own ways 

281.63 282.50 A: okay 

282.90 283.46 B: um 

283.95 287.84 B: eh and that tends to clash we're both right and neither one is ever wrong 

287.88 290.07 A: oh lord how do you resolve anything 

288.15 288.78 B: and we will 

290.55 294.00 B: uh this is going to sound terrible but um 

294.34 303.31 B: usually we yell and yell and yell and that's those are our personalities we yell and let it out and then five minutes after we've gone out separate ways we're 

304.28 306.59 B: we act as though nothing had ever happened in the first place 

307.02 308.21 A: well that works for you 

308.15 308.90 B: but we both 

309.36 311.97 B: kind of resolve our conflicts kind of the same way 

312.34 312.84 A: well that 

312.38 321.49 B: so i think compatibility is a big thing and a i don't think attractiveness necessarily or anything like that because that wears off i think it's compatibility in the end 

319.85 320.72 A: exactly 

321.79 325.87 A: well you know what you're married i'm not and you know what you're probably 

321.85 322.45 B: yeah 

334.28 339.46 A: and it was not a good relationship to be in and it started because of 

339.73 343.22 A: i'm shallow and i liked the way he looked in his jeans 

342.79 344.86 B: oh 

343.37 347.44 A: it was love at first sight and i got exactly what i deserved 

347.55 350.61 A: and i was in a relationship that i couldn't get out of 

350.73 352.71 A: because a lot of it was 

352.85 354.44 A: that just that chemical thing 

355.10 358.05 A: you know and i was just too emotionally immature 

358.65 359.31 A: to 

359.50 366.68 A: (( )) know how to deal with that and it wasn't until ten years of my life had gone by i had had a child with this man 

366.79 373.81 A: that i realized that you know i knew all along eh i would never marry him we even went as far as the engagement ring 

373.96 374.42 B: oh 

374.58 376.44 A: and of course had the baby 

376.27 377.86 B: well yeah 

376.57 383.29 A: uh but didn't do the marry thing and um i knew in my heart of hearts that i never would 

383.34 386.51 B: i don't that if you're together after that long it's going to happen 

386.84 387.59 B: i mean i 

388.25 391.65 B: you hear of situations of where people stay together forever without being 

391.97 395.22 B: i mean heterosexual staying together without being married 

393.89 394.30 A: right 

395.46 397.54 B: but if you're going to be together that long 

398.22 398.50 B: what 

398.62 404.16 B: the difference uh i i don't want to say what's the difference some people will say oh it's only a piece of paper 

411.27 414.64 A: view of the world and this is the way i deal with the world 

411.75 412.26 B: mhm 

412.66 413.13 B: mhm 

418.78 429.01 A: people look at me and probably make certain moral judgments about me not knowing me seeing as i have two children out of wedlock but the fact remains is that i i do have 

429.34 430.51 A: certain moral 

430.95 433.57 A: lines that i won't cross and 

432.71 433.55 B: well and that 

433.85 434.98 B: everyone i mean 

433.89 434.44 A: standing 

442.75 443.47 B: mhm 

443.45 447.47 A: and i i knew that i would never do it with that man i knew it was never right 

447.66 452.16 A: he would never in my heart of hearts i didn't think that he accepted my older son 

452.50 453.27 A: as much as 

453.69 454.70 A: his his own 

454.99 463.52 A: and i couldn't marry somebody who couldn't do that so in in in that instance you know i put my son before him i put my older son before my younger son and wouldn't marry 

463.73 469.34 A: my younger sons father because of it be but we used to fight oh my 

469.64 471.29 A: god we would fight he was 

471.44 472.36 A: italian 

473.11 474.56 A: and the only boy

482.29 488.77 A: he's the prince he was raised that you know th- the world revolved around him the sun rose and set on him 

488.85 494.07 B: well we're in south dakota i don't even think there's one italian in the state 

491.59 496.56 A: that's so funny 

496.17 498.69 B: my husband is c- my husband is swedish 

498.95 499.62 A: okay 

499.65 501.18 B: so
