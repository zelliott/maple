60.52 65.84 A: oh i don't know too much about it to be honest with you about you know uh i don't does 

66.06 68.61 A: does anyone have the vehicle to get it here 

69.13 76.01 B: well that's a i guess that's a big question you know but um uh you know uh it just so happens that um 

76.15 85.09 B: uh i'm from uh my home is in trenton new jersey and that's where they had the anthrax stuff and it doesn't take much just could be a letter 

81.30 82.57 A: yeah 

85.93 86.46 B: you know that 

85.98 87.74 A: that's true to to 

86.60 87.29 B: e- 

87.44 96.13 B: that it could be sent it and um you know you have letters going all over the country to random um uh people i guess and they open it up and 

96.26 102.99 B: uh uh and uh you know could contaminate a house it could contaminate a family yeah 

99.88 101.95 A: yeah it's true that a whole household 

102.31 103.85 A: people that's true 

103.62 105.66 B: yeah so i wonder 

105.85 109.15 B: uh uh i you know uh i i don't know how much of a threat it is 

109.67 113.10 B: but uh i guess one of the questions would be eh what you're suggesting 

114.13 115.79 B: you know it's the delivery system 

114.54 114.87 A: mm 

117.06 120.62 A: like i'd wonder that about you know the state of the union address last night 

117.07 122.32 B: yeah 

121.09 122.73 A: about the saddam hussein 

123.48 124.72 A: eh does he is 

125.11 127.80 A: is he capable of getting anything over here 

128.80 133.18 B: well 

129.03 133.62 A: like are his missiles i mean it's horrible enough everything he's doing and i do think it's all bad 

134.41 138.32 B: well i'm i'm very much against the war uh i mean yeah 

134.47 134.77 A: but 

136.96 137.66 A: are you 

138.48 140.56 B: i am i don't see the point 

141.10 144.49 B: there're so many other nations that are equally bad what are we going to do all of them 

144.92 146.87 A: that is true i do think there are other 

146.39 147.91 B: you know where's it going to stop 

148.60 151.37 B: and if you know it seems to me we should be able to 

151.81 154.37 B: to um coerce him in other ways 

154.88 165.43 B: to um uh stop doing this stuff but you know we're we also have ah bioterrorist stockpiles i mean what if we get a crazy person in our our system 

162.54 163.29 A: right 

165.65 169.46 B: yeah what a- an employee it doesn't even have to be the president 

165.83 167.93 A: what do you do yeah it's true 

169.96 171.31 A: right anybody 

170.00 172.96 B: you know this anthrax stuff had to come from somewhere 

173.66 177.04 A: yeah and you wonder how much other things they have stockpiled here 

176.69 177.14 B: yeah 

177.55 187.47 B: yeah well i don't know yeah 

177.57 182.73 A: i mean you know all with the intention i'm sure of making vaccines and so on and so forth but 

183.54 187.56 A: but what all it you're right it takes one wacko who works there 

188.28 189.25 A: and who's to prevent 

189.65 193.00 A: somebody maybe with the bad intentions of intentionally getting that job 

193.17 196.58 B: exactly and then you know it do- again it it 

196.68 207.02 B: -s um uh it doesn't take a lot doesn't take high tech you know it isn't a matter of missiles you know it could be in um uh it could be in a boat carrying oil 

207.82 209.00 A: well that's true 

207.87 216.63 B: um that (( duh )) comes into a port -n- and um has stuff so i think it's a i think it's a serious problem and i don't know that there's a a good way to stop it 

217.58 219.99 B: you know just as we couldn't stop the world trade thing 

217.85 218.39 A: yeah 

220.50 226.19 B: you know who whose who would figure 

222.30 226.50 A: right i don't yeah certain things are i don't know that there is a way to stop 

226.31 237.98 B: yeah that i know even if they have intelligence you know if they unless they have exact intelligence i don't know if it could be prevented um 

226.79 230.03 A: who'd have ever predicted that i don't know 

238.53 239.47 B: there's um 

240.01 243.72 B: you know there's always somebody who will find a way to defeat the system 

243.91 247.38 A: oh yeah yeah well i think even the airport security thing 

244.77 254.49 B: yeah yeah 

247.90 259.02 A: and there are still people getting things on you know and some of it i'm sure just a test to see how does it really work or not but my goodness you think wow they've done all these things to prevent it and it still doesn't work 

258.92 261.03 B: do you feel any sense of threat 

261.86 267.49 B: personally with these things or or are you just sort of saying well i won't worry until it happens 

262.62 263.32 A: um 

268.61 269.58 A: i don't 

269.80 273.86 A: yeah sort of i mean only because i don't know that 

274.78 278.27 A: that if i spend a lot of my time worrying about it i can't 

278.43 285.92 A: particularly do anything about it at this point you know for my immediate family you know i thi- so 

278.61 280.94 B: right 

282.13 284.73 B: right 

286.64 291.69 A: for me to s- i guess i don't know for me to sit around and think about it all the time and really worry about it 

287.99 291.79 B: yeah 

292.04 295.27 A: you know like couple of my neighbors are really concerned 

295.00 296.45 B: are they 

295.69 297.56 A: yeah very concerned and 

297.90 307.54 B: do they have small children or no kidding are they uh are they from here 

298.12 299.20 A: you know 

299.80 301.43 A: no no they're older people 

301.92 303.69 A: well yeah yeah and 

305.11 305.85 A: yeah

309.01 310.04 A: croatia 

310.13 310.66 B: mhm 

310.87 311.78 A: and 

312.11 312.90 A: they 

313.43 318.45 A: uh have a lot of concern they're not that much older but they have a lot of concerns and 

316.47 317.20 B: right 

318.68 321.82 A: you know i said to be honest with you i just 

321.92 324.35 B: yeah 

321.92 325.37 A: i can't do anything today about it at all you know and i mean 

325.48 330.82 A: even as far as voting on something is not even available to do so for me to 

325.50 329.74 B: right 

330.92 334.66 A: try you know i can't build a bomb shelter or something it's just not 

331.00 334.54 B: right 

335.08 336.81 A: in my day to day life 

336.48 337.10 B: right 

337.12 341.12 A: it doesn't impact me enough at this point what about you do you think about it a lot 

340.19 348.95 B: no i eh because uh i feel the same way there's there is uh i mean what are you going to do are you going to run for canada or are you going to you know what uh 

347.88 348.46 A: right 

349.08 351.24 B: i mean uh what can you do 

349.71 350.77 A: it's true 

351.35 352.68 B: um 

353.01 355.67 B: uh i don't see that um 

355.81 356.75 B: you know i'm 

356.99 368.44 B: uh eh that there is there's anyway that the in- the individual citizen can get involved in this and you have your intelligence agencies but um you know 

368.57 369.73 B: they're limited 

369.85 373.94 B: i mean how much how many billions of dollars you going to pour into that 

373.11 373.59 A: yeah 

373.69 374.78 A: that's true too 

374.62 375.82 B: you know and um 

376.08 377.37 A: to get nowhere 

376.97 377.49 B: mhm 

377.95 384.93 B: yeah and y- you may or may not um be successful in preventing something so um 

385.34 386.70 B: it's a scary world 

386.85 388.68 B: i mean it's a very scary world we've got 

387.72 388.68 A: yeah 

388.92 390.11 A: it really is it's 

389.83 395.12 B: yeah um but you know i don't think the uh i don't think the nuclear 

395.90 400.38 B: thing i think bioterrorism is more of a problem than the nuclear thing as a matter of fact 

400.02 400.44 A: yeah 

400.58 402.32 A: i i think that's probably true 

401.81 404.41 B: because very few countries can hide nuclear 

404.67 408.63 B: stuff because a you need huge facilities to produce 

405.42 406.08 A: right 

409.11 412.21 B: um the um uh 

412.41 413.59 B: the weapons grade 

413.71 417.31 B: uranium and those are pretty easy to spot 

414.84 415.48 A: mhm 

417.79 418.33 B: um 

418.74 423.49 B: and i- it's not something you can conceal in a shoe or whatever 

419.12 420.02 A: oh i didn't real- 

422.16 423.89 A: right right 

424.43 429.22 A: and i i guess since nuclear has been around for so long 

425.22 426.29 B: oh my 

430.29 438.69 A: i think you know in the sense that so they they hit you and you hit them and and then everybody's gone so i mean really i think it maybe keeps itself in 

432.37 437.03 B: right 

438.79 439.50 A: check 

439.26 439.85 B: right 

440.05 440.49 B: yeah 

440.60 448.20 A: only because it's not something i mean if you do that to the wrong person they certainly have the capabilities of retaliating and then what good is it 

447.49 447.89 B: yeah 

448.79 452.28 B: but it was pretty let me tell you in in trenton it was pretty scary when you 

452.65 456.30 B: you you start receiving mail that's sealed in little plastic packages 

456.35 457.16 A: mm 

456.85 457.30 B: saying 

457.68 459.69 B: we believe this is irradiated 

459.97 464.78 B: but if you would like to and if you would if you don't uh want to open it just put it in the garbage 

461.75 462.19 A: oh 

465.62 466.74 A: really 

467.60 468.08 A: huh 

472.00 477.09 B: and it was all sealed up and you you know you sit there and you look at this thing and you say i don't even want to touch it 

476.45 477.43 A: right 

477.52 482.98 B: you know i don't even want to put my fingers on the plastic 

477.57 477.94 A: oh 

479.43 484.42 A: yeah cer- i don't that certainly i didn't realize that they would they would actually you know 

485.05 487.21 A: tell you we think we've done we think we've 

487.87 489.69 A: because they radiate it to kill it right 

487.90 490.31 B: yes 

490.69 496.90 B: and supposedly that was done but they won't they won't put anything i think on paper to guarantee that it was done 

490.74 492.22 A: (( what maybe stuff could work )) 

496.95 497.63 A: right 

497.64 502.32 B: i know it 

498.14 502.39 A: and then you know unlucky you if it's not yours it didn't work on 

502.89 504.88 B: so i just sa- i just saved those thing- 

505.45 507.16 B: i didn't even want to put it in the garbage 

507.51 508.82 B: you know i because i thought 

508.96 509.44 B: well 

509.80 510.28 B: you know 

511.16 512.40 B: what what if it it 

512.52 515.30 B: breaks open and then somebody else is exposed 

513.51 514.65 A: in the right 

515.70 516.33 A: yeah 

516.10 516.89 B: you know so 

517.06 519.16 B: here i have this thing sitting and i i took 

519.33 521.81 B: a couple of baggies 

534.40 534.70 B: safe 

534.92 537.65 A: yeah that that was really scary that 

538.23 541.66 A: you know of course you feel more there right in new jersey and 

541.20 546.99 B: well you wonder you know you start looking you start looking around and you say who the heck is in my neighborhood 

545.23 549.16 A: you know and i hate to say any kind of um 

549.82 553.12 A: like profiling and so on and so forth but you know 

551.34 553.09 B: yeah 

553.35 557.26 A: if that's who's doing it then i guess there is a a profile needed 

556.13 559.19 B: yeah 

557.67 562.94 A: if i call the police and say you know there's this chinese person trying to get into my house 

563.38 568.21 A: i don't know that they're going to go look for everybody they're going to go look for the chinese people
