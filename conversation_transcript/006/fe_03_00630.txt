96.51 96.96 B: you know 

96.55 101.45 A: did you find you're more sensitive to that because of your experience with the uh with the first person

148.92 150.50 B: you know um 

151.07 155.26 B: i think those are the most important things though especially that you get along together 

155.09 157.49 A: cause you're going to be spending an awful lot of time together 

157.66 162.41 B: yes and somebody who- whose if you know uh wants to know

174.97 175.70 B: yes 

176.16 184.01 A: i have i know of a lot of married couples that go on separate vacations and they probably have better marriages from what i can see cause they let each other be themselves first and then 

183.39 191.85 B: yeah oh that's a really really important thing too um yes so letting somebody be themselves having taking time to them self 

192.43 194.51 B: is uh i think really really important

278.78 279.96 B: and uh 

280.20 287.72 B: before i wa- i was not ready to to be married a second time but this this baby really really changed my life and uh so 

286.16 286.76 A: aw 

288.34 290.28 B: i know but defini- oh and i think 

290.40 291.32 B: um 

291.96 293.41 B: like uh looking for 

293.71 299.49 B: somebody who's going to be a good parent also because if you really if you're going to be 

299.61 305.57 B: in in the future parents or think of motherhood you're really going to need help it 

306.66 312.19 B: i don't know what i would do if i didn't have the help that i have from my husband it's really really hard 

311.95 318.19 A: i work from home i'm a transcriptionist and i'm afraid i watch too much oprah in the afternoon i'm typing but i'm listening and they had 

317.71 318.37 B: oh that's okay 

318.41 319.27 A: they had a show on 

319.50 322.47 A: and they said how many people that get married and then after the wedding 

322.98 330.47 A: how shocked they are at how the real life is it wasn't anything like they thought it would be was your situation like that or did you pretty well know i mean maybe with your first husband 

336.57 338.88 B: first one i think if i were to lived with him i would've noticed 

339.54 343.26 B: habits that something was wrong i would've gotten a real good clue 

343.73 350.59 B: and i didn't do that and so with the second husband i lived with him uh for a while first to watch how he is 

351.05 351.74 B: um 

352.16 359.52 B: not only with his family on the phone in private his habits you know um everything that people keep secret 

359.93 361.26 B: on the inside 

361.59 368.81 B: you know once you live with somebody long enough you can't hide those things and if you do you're really really good at it you know 

370.26 381.22 B: right and so i i i lived with my second husband for a while and to check out his mental stability and reactions to certain situations and stuff like that i was a 

389.24 393.32 B: over my mom she's totally against that i'm i'm i'm twenty eight 

393.80 395.01 B: so i how old are you 

395.04 396.88 A: i'm forty five i could be your mother (( )) 

401.65 407.24 B: the older people i talk to there's a difference in the generation the thinking of the generation 

407.41 407.97 A: i think that 

408.36 411.79 A: i don't get that hung up on a when i was in my twenties i was all i had different 

412.25 414.68 A: more conservative views but as i've gone through life and 

415.26 417.88 A: live things and had my own problems and seen people 

417.97 422.05 A: i think i hope i've become more caring and more forgiving and and more accepting because 

422.64 424.85 A: life isn't perfect and people aren't perfect 

425.14 426.37 A: and we shouldn't expect 

427.01 427.99 A: i think we have to be 

428.37 432.03 A: quite you have to be very caring about other people because you know 

432.55 435.75 A: bad things happen to people and you have to put yourself in there footsteps and 

436.35 437.09 B: yeah 

436.78 437.44 A: marriage isn't 

437.60 442.81 A: it isn't like it was like when our grand you know my my grandparents or even my parents my mom was a stay at home 

442.20 444.38 B: i think so too i was talking to a 

453.35 454.00 A: well that's (( )) 

456.52 458.34 B: it's very very different 

457.99 465.25 A: i know a lot of couples that that met on the internet i house sat for a friend that when she went on her honeymoon she has a ni- very very nice husband and (( )) 

465.69 469.31 A: but you have to also be very careful too but it's like that way in real life too you know 

467.38 468.12 B: yes 

477.03 485.95 B: oh on the internet also dating so i totally agree and it's a whole different world out there as my friend was saying you know way back when i used to date 

501.58 504.44 B: oh i know you're trying to court this you know this girl and 

504.76 508.35 B: and that sort of thing and the girl would get to choose the best out of 

514.64 518.29 B: and we put everything we can into him and they only last a year or two 

518.70 524.46 B: you know and that's another chunk and then you we have to go onto somebody else and put that time and forth in to it 

524.58 525.12 A: my 

525.03 525.57 B: and 

525.72 534.00 A: sister and brother in-law were met on they they were lined up on a blind date by their friends and it was a friday the thirteenth was there first date 

547.64 550.07 B: i think sometimes you just know 

550.19 560.37 B: you just know (( )) you really do and just because you're forty five doesn't mean that it's over yet you know i think that that we do a lot to um 

560.55 570.18 B: put ourselves in situations where we could date or could not date like if you're a home body you're not going to get out and you're not going to meet anybody you know but if if -you're 

583.81 588.85 A: i i live in a rural area the town i'm from is is welcome it's called welcome in the sun it's only eight hundred people
