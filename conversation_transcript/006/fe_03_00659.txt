61.85 62.99 B: you've done it before 

62.85 63.37 A: um 

63.60 66.36 A: all right well changes to my life since september eleventh 

67.87 73.71 A: i guess i was kind of in shock after it all happened, i didn't have access i was at work when it when everything started and 

74.24 75.61 A: we normally have t._v.'s 

76.10 78.74 A: going but we were in the process of a move so i didn't get to like 

79.29 85.02 A: see everything and hear everything as it happened like i heard about it on the radio and it was like it didn't really 

81.70 82.16 B: mhm 

85.15 86.63 A: it didn't register at first 

87.00 90.39 A: you know because i didn't i didn't get to actually physically see it with my eyes 

90.57 91.78 A: and so 

92.26 95.07 A: it took me a while and since i am on the west coast like 

95.93 100.69 A: i never really like felt the same amount of impact of it as maybe other people did 

100.81 103.85 A: because i mean the only think i saw was like heightened security 

104.18 113.23 A: you know everywhere there was more people like you know go to the airport they check your trunk but even then they weren't really che- i mean like when i went to the airport, they like just look in your trunk and open it and close it 

104.34 104.83 B: right 

113.48 121.18 B: yeah that's what um my sister had come down for thanksgiving and they had all kinds of christmas presents in there and they didn't really check them either 

121.02 121.60 A: yeah 

122.22 122.85 A: and e- 

123.64 131.78 A: but i like i haven't made any changes to my life still since then like i haven't become more cautious, as a result, you know i'm already a pretty cautious person. 

132.45 133.08 A: so e- 

133.36 137.85 B: no i haven't either i'm the same way i didn't pay much attention to it 

137.97 139.79 B: i didn't know what was going on and 

140.07 144.88 B: and then i heard it on the t._v. and i was you know just watched it but i didn't think you know it didn't hit me 

145.14 146.00 B: personally 

146.05 146.62 A: yeah 

155.58 156.11 A: yeah 

158.12 159.37 B: so that made a difference 

159.93 160.51 A: yeah like 

161.14 171.94 A: once i found out more about it it really upset me like i mean like just seeing some of the pictures and everything like i mean it made me break down you know i started crying like 

173.41 176.62 A: to my lifestyle like after i like after i looked at it i kind of like 

177.01 178.48 A: disassociated with it 

178.97 179.99 A: where i wasn't 

181.34 184.10 A: like affected at by it like as much as i though i would be 

184.25 189.73 A: like other people were saying like oh you know i can't fly now and i can't do this stuff now and i'm like 

190.31 191.53 A: that's what these people wanted 

191.73 197.94 A: you know so like i really didn't want to change my lifestyle just to to say hey these people have that big of an effect on us 

199.11 201.41 B: did you see ah do you listen to country music 

201.41 202.02 A: yeah 

201.95 203.65 B: and the allen jackson songs 

203.52 204.12 A: yes 

204.01 208.71 B: now then that that song really just tells about everything to me it tells all 

210.50 211.63 B: and what people went through 

211.86 212.43 A: yeah 

212.88 214.09 A: yeah an i mean i hav- 

214.66 217.20 A: there a com- have you seen those commercials right now where um 

217.31 223.52 A: i forget who puts them out but like they show a row of houses and it says you know the terrorists want to change us 

223.91 226.90 A: and then they come back on and everyone has flags us and everything 

226.91 228.52 B: oh no they don't have them here yet 

228.61 233.22 A: oh it's it's kind of it's like touching because you look at it and it says well they did change us. 

233.41 233.85 B: yeah 

233.68 238.41 A: and it's like they change this for the better like because i mean there are more people now that take more pride in being 

238.58 239.74 A: an american i guess 

244.47 247.28 B: and he had a speak called the flag man 

247.54 254.87 B: and he would go around and straighten out anybody's flag that was messed up and anybody who didn't have a flag he would ask if he could put one up 

255.07 260.62 B: and you know he really got into it and everything after that so i think it made a big difference like he was in vietnam and stuff 

260.43 262.26 A: yeah yeah and 

262.41 268.03 A: sorry my other line is ringing here i'm at work don't tell anyone but 

268.18 270.55 A: but um i think that also 

271.15 272.33 A: people who 

272.50 278.97 A: wouldn't have gone like to parades and wouldn't have shown their patriotism are showing it more 

277.61 278.17 B: mhm 

279.72 282.01 A: and i think that was of course that's a good thing 

283.17 285.86 A: you want people to take more pride in who they are 

285.93 286.50 B: oh yeah 

286.63 294.83 B: i mean it seemed like too like the president and stuff like that you don't think about things like that until something happens and they you feel like you're more a apart of everything 

294.79 295.28 A: yeah 

295.67 296.79 A: yeah and like 

297.51 300.07 A: i saw a lot younger people taking more pride too 

300.12 301.35 B: right do you have children 

301.50 304.40 A: no i don't have any children yet i'm i'm only twenty three 

307.54 313.65 B: and they done a lot of different things you know like um sending kids letters who had lost somebody 

313.80 318.16 B: and you know just all different kind of things that you know pertain to this september eleventh 

315.97 316.56 A: yeah 

318.33 323.75 A: yeah and i think too i mean you just saw people with more sense of pride 

323.97 329.60 A: about who what they represent what they thought america was and it brought brought people together more 

329.85 330.37 B: right 

330.36 333.09 A: made them more trusting of fellow americans you know 

337.64 344.67 B: really know what was going on but i mean they had them watching everything that went on and it wasn't like one day it was like going on for 

345.23 352.99 B: days after and even after a year after it happened you know they start having all these things and going back and talking to people that had went through 

353.34 356.48 B: you know was right there at it and how it changed their lives 

356.80 357.33 A: yeah 

358.46 359.23 A: yeah and 

359.99 361.25 A: i also like 

362.44 367.04 A: i think that people never actually though something like this would happen to this extent 

367.52 367.77 A: like 

369.05 373.85 A: like certain generations didn't realize the impact of terrorists or war 

374.13 377.85 A: as much like especially like you know twenty five and younger 

378.39 380.55 A: only thing we ever experienced was desert storm 

380.77 381.22 B: right 

380.78 384.72 A: desert storm lasting what like twenty for hours maybe and like so 

383.42 383.94 B: yeah 

385.80 390.32 A: i think that people were so not that like wars are a good thing or you know attacks like this are good but 

390.60 395.01 A: i think it brought people back to that sense of being a nation as one 

394.75 395.87 B: right 

395.50 400.39 A: were people who are older already felt that before because they dealt with other wars prior 

400.92 404.50 A: you know like um vietnam war even though vietnam war didn't bing people as close 

404.96 407.17 B: but like the depression and stuff like that 

406.02 414.15 A: like the depression or world war two like where i mean during those eras where people were came so close together because they had to and and 

414.93 417.87 A: it made the u._s. more close to each other 

418.19 421.69 B: and i can just imagine how it was the in new york at the time 

421.64 429.48 A: yeah yeah i mean you see i mean i watched i watched everything on the news about it and they like had somebody who was actually there with a camera 

430.33 432.65 A: like when the policemen went it to the 

433.61 435.77 A: to the building the fireman actually 

435.76 436.17 B: uh-huh 

436.08 439.00 A: and he was like he was doing a videography 

439.57 440.57 A: of the firemen 

440.98 442.08 A: before this started 

442.65 446.93 A: and then he was there when the fall came in and he was filming it from the very begging 

447.19 448.34 A: and um 

448.62 450.58 A: it was just amazing to see people just like you know 

451.10 452.35 A: helping each other and 

452.85 454.49 A: and being there for one another 

454.91 455.58 A: like 

455.78 461.61 A: i think it bought i think it brought new york a lot closer to everyone else especially when people have such a negative image of new york 

461.56 462.08 B: mhm 

462.40 465.28 A: whether it's like oh it's new york don't want to go there 

466.11 472.84 B: and you know even people that don't watch the news and stuff like i'm one who's not really into the news i mean i watch the weather but that's about it 

472.63 473.12 A: right 

473.04 479.60 B: and then something you know happened like then you know or you know what's going on i mean everybody's involved it's not just a few people 

479.77 487.06 A: yeah yeah like and then plus too we also forgot it wasn't only new york it was also washington d._c. 

487.10 487.84 B: mhm 

487.69 489.75 A: and like the pentagon where 

489.88 491.01 A: i mean that's suppose to be like 

491.52 494.21 A: the hardest you know that's like that's the heart of our 

494.43 495.50 A: security systems 

496.19 496.69 A: and 

497.44 500.54 A: like i was just reading the thing where they awarded 

500.69 502.67 A: a woman who's life partner 

502.98 503.43 B: uh-huh 

503.19 504.44 A: dies in the 

504.67 507.08 A: in the attack and how people were 

507.50 511.73 A: they were it was like setting new precedents for people to get benefits 

512.13 514.94 A: when they're not actually married but they're domestic partners 

514.94 515.41 B: right 

515.46 516.44 A: and so it's like 

516.79 518.97 A: it's like it's doing all these other it's like 

519.16 523.14 A: there's this huge wave that's kind of like happening now like a ripple effect 

523.37 525.84 B: yeah because it's i mean it's everybody it's not just 

525.95 535.82 B: you know people who who's married i mean it's friends and family and relatives and you know so many people was touched in so many placed all over the world 

533.63 534.21 A: yeah 

534.95 539.93 A: yeah and some people knew like i mean people in new york some of them might have knew like twenty people who had died 

540.52 541.04 A: you know like 

541.90 549.96 A: and those twenty people like you know who like you know (( )) i don't even know how many people died that day like it's like a isn't it like fifteen hundred or 

550.86 551.68 A: i have no idea 

551.87 553.40 B: i know i never been did seen the 

553.52 555.05 B: for a total of how many 

554.77 555.48 A: yeah 

561.66 563.96 B: you know most of them you know their husband or wife and 

564.23 572.13 B: and you know they had these kids and stuff and they just never dreamed that when they went to work that day that that's what would happen i mean nobody knew 

570.60 571.26 A: yeah 

572.00 575.85 A: or like the story i mean the story that touched me the most was the people who 

577.08 584.11 A: were like suppose to be there that day and then they changed their mind or or they missed their bus kind of thing 

581.12 581.74 B: yeah 

582.65 586.59 B: i'm sure they was glad about that 

586.05 591.12 A: yeah i mean like but then their are like storied where there was this woman who was in a wheel chair and she was on the very top floor 

591.81 594.61 A: and everybody around here carried her down the stairs 

595.27 596.55 B: oh i didn't hear about that one
