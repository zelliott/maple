27.24 29.03 B: have you had any changes 

30.47 31.55 A: um 

32.29 36.31 A: i guess the biggest change is the financial hit that took our

42.56 43.71 B: yeah 

43.12 44.03 A: um

52.66 54.69 A: i still fly i don't 

56.07 62.36 B: yeah i fly too i was nervous i didn't for about a year but then it didn't really come up i didn't have to fly so 

62.91 65.52 A: um i guess i figured that 

66.66 70.65 A: it was like a fool me once that i really didn't think it would you know 

68.66 69.58 B: yeah 

71.04 72.53 A: they had done that 

72.58 75.34 A: and it wouldn't be happening again 

75.98 81.77 B: yeah i was actually in new york on the uh anniversary because my family that's where i'm from i'm from brooklyn 

81.41 82.36 A: okay 

81.61 85.05 B: and i went up there to visit my family it just happened to be at that time 

84.81 96.98 B: and it was strange i was nervous beforehand i you know a little bit it didn't stop me but i was a little bit nervous but then once i got there you know we just can't sit around thinking about it you know just kind of life goes on 

87.87 88.93 A: mhm 

97.10 98.18 B: people might have 

97.17 100.03 A: did you go down to the to the trade center 

99.70 107.12 B: no i didn't go i didn't go down there because that wasn't the part of town i was in i was in more central manhattan 

106.82 107.75 A: okay 

107.21 110.20 B: and then in brooklyn and new jersey but 

110.54 112.66 B: [mn] yeah 

112.88 114.89 A: any other changes in your life 

115.07 116.95 B: (( uh let's see )) 

118.30 126.27 B: i don't know i guess i for a while there i paid a lot more attention to the news i mean i always keep up but now it's like if ever 

126.13 136.65 B: i'm home and doing chores i always kind of have c._n._n. on in the background especially at the very beginning there when it seemed like there was breaking news things it was like what else could happen we're breaking it every few minutes 

136.44 142.71 A: right and i think probably a lot of people pay more attention to the news now than they used to 

142.67 143.96 B: yeah 

143.55 144.46 A: (( um )) 

145.17 149.24 A: because you're right there are a lot of things that they tend to come on with 

149.17 150.72 B: yeah 

152.17 156.57 A: i think probably i tell my kids i call them a little more often just 

156.55 157.68 B: yeah 

156.93 158.02 A: to say hi 

157.81 158.74 B: [laughter] 

159.33 165.81 B: that's good yeah when it happened my parents were living overseas so it was strange in a way i was 

166.38 173.70 B: glad for them because i didn't know what was gonna happen here i mean when it first happened you know who who knew if things were gonna start happening every day or not 

173.22 174.19 A: right 

173.90 182.07 B: but in a way it was hard for them being overseas they were in asia because like they felt so removed from everything and a lot of the uh 

182.12 187.14 B: media over there was a little harsher than it was over here so they were kind of 

187.73 194.94 B: it was hard for them having to be in a kind of anti american climate when all this was going on and everyone was in shock [laughter] 

191.78 194.08 A: oh yeah i can imagine 

194.35 197.44 A: oh what does what did they do that they were in egypt 

197.78 199.11 B: (( oh no they were in asia )) 

198.98 200.37 A: oh asia okay 

199.46 202.77 B: (( yeah they were in hong kong [laughter] i know what that would have been )) 

200.89 204.65 A: okay i thought you said egypt and i'm thinking oh god [laughter] 

203.50 207.19 B: (( [laughter] egypt would have been really bad )) 

206.57 208.67 A: yeah [laughter] 

207.79 208.83 B: [laughter] 

209.69 210.67 A: um 

211.71 215.11 A: my son travels he's got a girlfriend 

215.34 218.41 A: or a good friend in um paris 

218.25 219.11 B: uh-huh 

218.81 222.07 A: and he goes over there to skiing about once a year 

222.08 224.75 A: and i always worry about him when he goes 

224.67 225.81 B: yeah 

225.17 226.79 A: and he said he um 

227.18 232.50 A: tries to affect a canadian accent and say he's from canada [laughter] 

229.74 230.97 B: (( [laughter] )) 

231.32 233.49 B: [laughter] 

234.30 235.74 A: cause he doesn't 

236.09 239.30 A: he speaks some french but not enough to 

237.55 238.54 B: (( uh-huh )) 

240.00 241.55 A: pull it off that he's 

241.62 243.30 A: not american so 

242.99 244.72 B: yeah 

245.09 255.44 B: yeah my dad was in korea just a couple of weeks ago when all that was starting to heat up and i was like oh god he was in seoul in south korea but i always get nervous when 

249.95 251.58 A: oh jeeze 

255.30 261.44 B: when he travels he travels internationally a lot he's actually been to the middle east but not since all this happened he used 

256.06 256.94 A: (( [noise] )) 

260.14 263.38 A: okay i was going to say does he ever get to go anywhere nice [laughter] 

262.69 269.89 B: yeah [laughter] he used to go to pakistan all the time but they haven't since september eleventh he hasn't been there i think he's been to india once but 

269.11 270.82 A: wow what does he do 

270.67 276.26 B: he works in retail so he goes over there to check the factories and make sure everything's okay 

276.00 277.03 A: okay 

276.68 279.57 B: so there's a lot of you know he gets to go to 

279.73 283.01 B: some nice places but it's mostly um 

283.24 285.67 B: mostly like taiwan and hong kong 

285.07 288.10 A: yeah places where they have the cheaper labor 

287.77 289.13 B: yeah 

288.43 289.43 A: yeah 

289.54 291.13 B: so [mn] 

291.80 296.25 B: it's but he's been to the middle east because they do a lot of uh 

296.60 306.58 B: they used to do some business with israel so he'd go to israel and like you have to have two passports because if you have israel stamped on your passport the middle eastern countries wouldn't let you in 

306.66 307.62 B: so 

307.88 309.47 B: i don't know i guess 

309.84 316.21 B: having two passports works i don't know exactly how it works but he says that how most people do because he used to have to go to egypt 

316.26 318.67 B: and like they would never 

318.74 325.13 B: they wouldn't let him in if he had the israeli stamp on this passport i think he only went to israel like once or twice it's not like he was there all the time 

325.65 330.67 B: but he doesn't go they don't send them to any of those places anymore i think they're too nervous 

330.61 332.84 A: [mn] i think that's a very good idea 

332.51 335.58 B: yeah especially pakistan where they could be kidnapped 

333.00 333.81 A: uh 

335.06 342.23 A: but that's right and there was a photographer and report in columbia just recently that got kidnapped i think it was last week 

341.59 343.22 B: yeah i saw that 

342.79 343.61 A: yeah 

344.33 345.73 B: so scary 

345.48 346.70 A: (( yes it is )) 

349.33 352.46 A: do you have do they come on and tell us when to stop do we have any ideas 

352.48 358.59 B: i think they probably do but i [laughter] [laughter] the little robot operator [laughter] 

354.19 356.71 A: okay [laughter] 

357.44 359.13 A: [laughter] 

359.53 365.29 A: uh i uh when i signed up to do this i really didn't have any idea what i was getting myself into 

365.39 366.53 B: (( yeah but )) 

365.51 366.18 A: (( but )) 

366.35 367.97 A: you can only do three of 'em 

367.92 368.84 B: uh-huh 

368.49 373.29 A: so and i guess we could have just said no we don't like that topic we want something nicer 

373.08 374.25 B: yeah 

373.78 375.85 A: and i don't know how much they expect us 

376.74 384.84 B: i think they said ten minutes isn't it ten minutes i i haven't been keeping track but i think that it's probably we're probably almost done 

379.48 380.45 A: okay 

384.56 386.26 A: (( yeah um )) 

386.68 392.17 A: and i guess some people could get into really political discussions over nine eleven and um 

391.91 395.97 B: yeah maybe they want us to argue [laughter] 

393.54 397.04 A: (( [laughter] well )) 

396.57 400.94 B: well what do you well who's gonna be for nine eleven [laughter] you 

399.13 400.80 A: yeah [laughter]

459.20 460.15 A: okay 

460.68 465.25 A: see if i can remember that when you become famous i'll say i talked to that lady on the phone one day [laughter] 

464.46 466.26 B: [laughter] 

467.28 471.19 B: so do you think that we- being in texas that like we're less 

471.50 479.10 B: connected to it because even if anything else happened i mean like i feel that it's pretty unlikely that anything would happen here like if you lived in 

477.61 481.48 A: okay no see being in houston scares me to death 

481.14 482.95 B: oh 'cause of the oil 

482.27 487.18 A: yes one big boom but not only that but all those pipes connect all of the 

483.02 484.20 B: oh 

487.24 489.17 A: count- all over the state 

489.07 490.20 B: yeah that's 

489.47 490.57 A: and if you 

491.68 497.31 A: set a fire in one of 'em and it gets bad enough it's gonna up all through the state so yeah it does 

497.16 498.22 B: yeah 

497.58 499.17 A: kinda freak me out here 

499.01 501.50 B: yeah i guess that's true i didn't think of that 

500.81 502.42 A: yeah um 

503.41 505.35 A: austin's such a neat place 

505.29 506.41 B: yeah 

505.49 508.99 A: i really like it there and i i probably would feel safer there 

509.15 510.23 A: but um 

510.85 521.66 B: yeah the only thing i could think of that made me nervous is like one of george bush's daughters goes to school here but i mean who would like blow up a city just because of that [laughter] you know i 

516.65 517.59 A: uh-huh 

521.37 523.39 A: [laughter] yeah [laughter] i i i 

522.21 533.11 B: mean you think i'm stupid but right after you know when i was worried about everything happening 'cause all my family you know was still in new york so i worry about them all the time and i have friends who live in d._c. 

529.91 531.09 A: mhm 

533.00 540.91 B: and it's like here it feels relatively safe like that's the only thing that's even political here [laughter] and then that he was the governor 

538.49 544.44 A: yeah i think they probably attack crawford like his ranch before they'd come after the daughter so 

543.71 545.04 B: (( yeah )) 

545.50 548.93 B: yeah i actually don't know where exactly is crawford do you know 

548.34 550.63 A: [laughter] it's somewhere out by waco 

550.47 553.22 B: okay so kind of between here and dallas 

552.61 554.05 A: yeah mhm 

554.11 560.94 B: you know because i wasn't sure it always seems like they were pretty like our local news always goes to cover it so i knew it couldn't be like that far 

560.54 562.55 A: yeah um 

562.77 564.00 A: yeah i i 

564.92 566.90 A: it can't be that big either 

566.89 569.06 B: yeah it must be a little town [mn] 

566.91 568.26 A: because i've [noise] 

568.48 572.30 A: i lived in outside of um well between dallas and 

572.37 578.27 A: fort worth for quite a while and would drive down to austin and stop and i don't remember any big signs or 

578.75 581.22 A: anything about crawford so 

580.19 592.01 B: yeah 'cause i went to high school in plano and i used to and my parents lived there while i was in college back here in austin we drove up and down the interstate all the time and i don't remember ever seeing signs for it 

592.13 596.01 B: either like hillsborough wacahatchi all those places but 

595.45 596.50 A: yeah 

596.52 598.35 B: it must be a little tiny town 

597.99 599.39 A: mhm
