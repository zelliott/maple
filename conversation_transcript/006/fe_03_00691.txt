169.82 170.81 B: that doesn't affect 

171.45 173.79 B: the airport security doesn't affect i don't think 

173.87 179.97 B: the smaller airport like around here like sue city probably the biggest airport around 

180.17 181.30 B: i mean omaha is 

182.23 183.70 B: an hour and a half away 

183.87 184.53 B: probably don't want 

184.71 191.33 B: (( )) city is about forty five minutes away and it's hundred thousand people you know you incorporate all the little 

192.02 193.67 B: (( )) type and you know there's 

193.91 195.66 B: and that's the biggest airport 

195.78 202.40 B: there is and you see a few things on the news about how they've had to tighten security and 

202.88 203.87 B: and how 

204.17 208.72 B: like the national they have the national guard like on the holidays they had the national guard 

209.35 209.88 B: um 

211.23 212.80 B: helping watch you know and 

212.52 213.21 A: yeah 

212.92 222.39 B: posted there but it it doesn't affect me i don't think as much as it does well you know people well where where are you located in 

221.89 224.21 A: yeah i mean for me it's a big deal because i'm 

225.07 227.83 A: washington d._c. area i live 

226.56 227.88 B: oh okay yeah i see 

228.16 230.59 A: twenty minutes outside the capital so 

229.98 230.79 B: oh wow 

232.32 235.38 A: so ah yeah i mean it's a pretty big deal here you 

235.54 237.30 B: yeah well i can imagine 

235.70 237.56 A: have to go to the airport ah 

238.13 240.56 A: a few hours early and they check i actually 

239.59 240.03 B: yeah 

241.15 241.76 A: um 

242.51 243.19 A: i 

243.49 245.28 A: just recently came back from 

245.62 246.18 A: seattle 

246.84 247.69 A: and um 

248.67 250.89 A: like i went through and i forgot to take off 

251.36 255.74 A: just like this little not even real silver bracelet that i had on when i went through 

255.14 255.53 B: mhm 

256.41 258.55 A: so they're like step aside and they 

258.80 259.77 A: do the whole thing it 

260.19 260.69 A: the 

262.94 264.98 A: and they like it dinged on my bracelet 

267.93 269.58 B: sometimes i think they can take it 

267.96 268.44 A: hm 

269.80 271.03 B: to extremes but 

271.55 274.72 B: you know like i said the the one time i did fly 

274.88 280.75 B: which like i said was twelve years ago was an international flight i didn't even get stopped by customs 

281.50 282.78 B: i mean i got 

281.54 282.22 A: yeah 

283.20 291.82 B: we did when got to england that's because you know when we're entering a new country on the way back they randomly pick people i didn't even get stopped by customs 

290.46 290.84 A: right 

292.42 299.41 B: you know twelve years ago and i could have been i mean obviously they x ray you're bag but other then that they 

293.93 294.39 A: right 

299.54 302.31 B: they didn't do a whole lot i mean you didn't have 

303.10 306.39 B: all this extra stuff that you have to do now 

306.00 309.68 A: yeah i had i had the scissors confiscated from this summer 

310.07 310.59 B: ew 

311.00 315.29 A: because i brought i hadn't even been thinking about them i brought them with me they were little sewing 

315.90 316.32 B: yeah 

316.58 317.72 A: and they were just in my backpack 

318.45 319.25 A: and ah 

319.39 321.18 A: they where like do you have scissors and i was like huh 

321.41 323.63 A: and then i remembered and they took them away 

322.57 323.17 B: yeah see 

324.07 328.83 B: any little thing i guess they say is it can be considered a weapon i can't 

328.32 329.75 A: yeah anything sharp 

330.30 332.12 B: and it can't do anything like that 

331.98 333.04 A: and they were telling like 

333.28 340.29 A: college students not to pack all their books in one section of their suitcases so when it's x. rayed it doesn't 

340.47 341.79 A: look like you have some 

342.44 344.91 A: bit thing there and like 

343.74 344.30 B: yeah 

344.54 345.00 B: yeah 

347.06 348.59 B: no it doesn't i mean the 

349.75 355.97 B: they need to worry about the borders more then they do but i think the airports yes but they need concentrate on 

357.26 360.89 B: other ways that people can get in as well besides the airports 

361.23 367.26 A: yeah and people can still really come into the airports and leave stuff there but they don't let people go through 

367.43 368.53 A: to the um 

369.18 371.57 A: to the terminals anymore unless you're on the flight 

372.17 372.48 B: hm 

372.92 373.66 A: which is 

374.06 374.86 A: i'm not sure 

375.13 377.19 A: what that accomplishes but i guess just 

377.76 379.20 A: they know who's back there 

378.71 384.00 B: unwanted passengers that i suppose try to sneak on and whatever you've to make sure you've got a ticket and 

384.02 384.46 A: yeah 

384.78 385.60 B: (( )) you can't 

384.87 388.48 A: so you can't have anyone like meet you when you come off your flight anymore and stuff 

387.81 388.48 B: yeah

484.97 485.52 B: for the 

485.68 486.51 B: city and stuff 

487.94 494.45 B: yeah the airport here doesn't even take any kind of flights in or out any more if you own plane that's about it 

495.20 498.70 B: you know they don't even have any kind of airport like that but 

499.55 500.26 B: yeah the 

502.28 503.83 B: i don't know i i guess 

505.02 506.72 B: the security thing to me 

507.70 509.68 B: like i sa- you know twelve years ago 

508.63 511.03 A: it's not something you really think about that much 

510.47 513.51 B: well yeah you don't think about but but 

515.92 517.88 B: yeah see i'm more worried 

518.00 519.13 B: i live 

519.74 520.95 B: right on missouri river 

521.55 523.93 B: have you ever seen a map you know where the missouri river separates 

523.47 524.48 A: yeah sort a 

524.74 525.31 A: right 

526.18 529.10 B: i'm right on the river in fact the river is less than a half of a mile 

531.59 532.70 B: and we live 

533.16 537.43 B: right where the dam is at gaven's point dam which is basically the biggest the last 

538.04 543.31 B: dam of before you get in to iowa down that area i'm more worried about somebody 

543.75 548.18 B: you know flying in or whatever and putting a bomb on that thing and flooding the whole place 

548.78 550.12 B: then i am i mean it 

550.86 551.77 B: one of the biggest 

552.43 555.81 B: dam sights and things like that and it would case 

556.44 557.18 B: quit a bit 

557.33 557.79 B: you know 

557.99 559.44 B: the dam if they 

559.79 568.21 B: wanted too they could go up the missouri river and there's like four there's these four system that they have the u._s. army core of engineering has 

568.69 571.61 B: they could do a lot of damage in a in a little bit of time 

572.46 580.97 B: but yeah i see it that so you know airport security is a big thing if you are in a bigger city like which you are being in the d._c. area 

581.07 583.72 B: you know out here it's it's not that big of a deal 

585.40 586.18 B: i had a couple of 

586.55 587.57 B: i i've had 

587.72 590.82 B: some people that said they flew over christmas that i work with and 

591.33 592.03 B: they said the 

592.44 594.61 B: they had to get there quit a few hours 

594.69 595.18 A: yeah 

595.21 599.47 B: early before they you know their flight so they made sure that they made their flight
