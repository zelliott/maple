65.63 68.31 A: i think that just for a while afterwards 

70.42 71.01 A: i just 

71.12 71.78 A: uh 

72.78 73.79 A: i think i could eh 

74.53 77.50 A: well i just think everything is kind of different after that 

77.72 79.87 A: for me i am i am only twenty seven 

80.47 81.48 A: and uh 

82.94 83.55 A: so 

85.99 86.66 A: i have never 

86.82 88.12 A: experienced anything 

88.67 89.18 A: that 

89.37 89.73 A: like 

90.50 93.67 A: a war or anything um that 

94.06 94.91 A: affected 

95.88 99.16 A: united states citizens um in that manner 

99.42 99.90 A: so 

100.78 107.14 A: you know i wasn't alive in pearl harbor during pearl harbor or anything like that so for me it just totally 

108.45 112.17 A: awakened my perspective and 

113.09 116.44 A: and the fact that these things really can happen and 

116.80 117.30 A: and 

117.69 120.65 A: you know in a global sense that we're all 

121.35 125.26 A: we all live together even though we live in separate countries 

125.38 127.60 A: and that it can happen anywhere 

127.98 132.77 A: so i know that every time i hear an airplane it's a completely different experience now 

133.81 136.17 A: i look up to make sure it's still flying
