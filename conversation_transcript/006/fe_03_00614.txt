31.60 32.40 A: yeah 

32.57 40.69 A: so um i was trying to see he when he first called he said holidays so for the last few minutes i've been trying to think my favorite holiday 

41.16 43.67 A: um it when i was a kid it was halloween 

44.31 47.03 A: because my birthday is right near halloween and i like 

47.14 48.78 A: getting dressed up quite a bit 

48.57 53.93 B: oh yeah yeah me too i think now i would have to go with christmas for my favorite

55.61 56.91 B: with my kids 

57.50 63.03 A: for n- my favorite now is g- is probably saint patrick's day simply because 

63.19 65.58 A: eh the party aspect 

64.80 70.78 B: well i'm a christian so christmas means you know quite a bit to me so 

71.53 73.63 B: but you know they also said something about 

74.25 76.98 B: if we could create our own holiday 

76.38 77.92 A: isn't (( )) uh um 

78.26 87.54 A: wow what a big concept i i really need you know i could take that that kind of question really seriously and would want to put some thought into it 

84.73 88.40 B: i know i mean that that requires some thought 

87.97 94.49 A: eh you know when you get granted powers like that you want to make sure you do a good job 

93.75 94.55 B: ha 

95.20 96.33 A: eh any thoughts on this 

95.21 98.96 B: maybe an extra mother's day 

97.59 101.06 A: that's a good idea 

101.89 104.67 A: i can see that um 

104.45 110.99 B: you know know a days mom have you know moms have to work and cook and clean and you know all that we need an extra mother's day i think 

107.08 108.07 A: oh yeah 

110.24 112.56 A: oh yeah i i'm thinking eh 

112.71 116.39 A: i don't want something that would be just hallmark card 

116.66 118.76 A: related you know that was like 

117.29 123.43 B: right n- nothing where all these all these companies can make a fortune off of 

121.06 121.90 A: right 

122.06 125.37 A: cash in on it and make it commercial and stuff like that 

126.80 127.21 A: um 

129.29 130.07 A: i know 

130.16 135.45 B: one holiday they've got the stuff out of the store and they've got something replacing it boom just like that 

134.31 134.82 A: yeah 

135.27 144.46 A: and now they're coming up with things like friendship day and secretary's day bosses day and all that kind of thing so i would want something 

138.09 140.72 B: right secretary's day 

144.66 145.78 A: it really 

146.57 148.70 A: maybe something like uh

151.00 152.07 B: yeah 

151.39 154.20 A: where everybody just got a 

154.35 156.38 B: a day off of everything 

154.36 155.05 A: uh

158.92 159.80 B: right 

159.21 164.47 A: or something you know eh i mean you had to let everybody go there wouldn't be any time and a half 

160.50 161.47 B: right 

162.91 171.75 B: nobody could go and buy anything it wasn't about what you were buying or what you were giving somebody that sounds great that's a good idea

169.08 169.63 A: uh-huh 

171.79 172.66 A: that's like

247.07 248.14 A: yeah likewise 

247.90 249.50 B: this is weird 

249.49 251.91 A: i could i could have something like um 

253.01 254.71 A: maybe animal day 

255.95 258.51 A: or oh i know how about like a 

259.30 261.36 A: eh an environment day where 

261.83 262.48 A: um 

264.18 265.47 A: people went around and and 

265.68 267.73 A: cleaned up things or 

267.95 268.81 A: and uh 

270.20 271.49 A: you know 

271.80 277.06 B: yeah where where s- a a day where it wasn't focused on human beings in other words 

276.22 280.80 A: right exactly like animals or the environment maybe animal day 

277.21 278.69 B: something where you know 

279.47 281.34 B: right yeah 

281.67 283.05 A: or the environment day 

283.66 286.83 A: well i guess we've got earth day but people don't really 

287.18 293.80 A: i don't know it's mostly just booths it seems like that hands out information at at little fairs 

287.92 288.48 B: no it's 

290.56 293.79 B: right right 

296.55 297.80 A: i'm trying to think 

298.83 301.08 A: and animal day what would you do like eh 

301.49 302.83 A: you know everyone would 

303.78 304.30 A: go 

304.40 313.89 A: clean up dog poop at the park i guess i'm thinking something that you actually do something you know that that's pro active that 

313.55 314.39 B: right 

314.14 317.87 A: that you that's hands on you know that's not about sending a card 

315.82 316.62 B: that's n- 

318.41 319.94 B: maybe volunteer day 

320.05 322.76 B: you volunteer at at your you know your local 

320.36 320.90 A: yeah 

323.04 323.64 B: food 

324.94 328.47 B: you know food pantry or something like that 

326.73 327.30 A: yeah 

327.91 328.37 A: yeah 

329.46 333.28 B: now that you know that's something that it doesn't involve money it just involves a little time 

329.60 330.32 A: okay 

332.82 333.77 A: exactly 

334.02 339.78 A: that's what i'm thinking something that that means something to people that's important for their 

339.88 347.02 A: oh spiritual growth yeah but th- their own spiritual growth and then important to the community also 

340.37 341.39 B: community 

341.86 343.00 B: yeah right 

347.24 348.46 A: our world in general 

348.60 351.34 B: because i mean nowadays all holidays are just 

351.56 352.43 B: to make a buck 

352.35 355.43 A: yeah you know what might be good is a peace day 

355.95 358.64 A: where if like if there's any conflicts 

359.41 360.83 A: around i mean 

360.93 363.36 A: they would just have to stop fighting just for that day 

366.74 368.04 A: that that might be a little bit 

369.25 371.02 A: grand in scope i guess 

371.35 376.01 B: hey but hey the sky is the limit this is our conversation 

373.93 376.04 A: yeah yeah that's true 

377.20 378.80 A: yeah peace day would be good 

379.73 380.35 A: or 

381.46 383.31 A: i guess we could have something goofy 

385.29 388.18 B: backward hat day 

386.55 387.10 A: yeah 

387.38 390.48 A: and actually that's funny cindy because i was thinking hats too 

390.50 394.35 B: that's the first thing that popped into my mind 

398.25 404.41 A: i mean you couldn't really say groucho marx glasses day 

405.71 408.64 A: you know it's funny cindy because my whole life 

409.22 412.43 A: and my name is ginger right my whole life 

410.87 411.28 B: uh-huh 

412.67 419.92 A: and this has happened at least a hundred times so so many times that it's not even coincidence anymore and it doesn't even shock me anymore 

420.26 422.17 A: whenever somebody forgets my name 

422.31 423.84 A: they call me cindy 

424.53 425.49 B: really 

425.03 435.12 A: not jenny or jennifer or anything that might be kind of close to ginger or a whole bunch of different names if they forgot it's 

435.27 436.10 A: always 

436.37 436.95 A: cindy 

437.14 440.74 A: and sometimes when somebody says cindy and i'm in a crowd i turn around 

437.30 437.64 B: eh 

441.42 441.90 B: eh 

441.76 451.31 A: because it might be somebody who forgot my i know it's really weird it's so far beyond coincidence and i've told people about this and they've been with me when it's happened 

442.02 444.41 B: that's so weird 

451.73 452.68 A: i said wow 

453.12 454.51 A: it does happen to you 

454.20 457.85 B: so of course your luck you would have to speak with a cindy huh 

456.52 464.86 A: my first my first call is a cindy i think that's really there's you know the coincidences just pile up so you just go okay 

466.01 467.43 B: that's interesting 

467.68 468.10 A: well 

470.00 470.78 A: let's see 

471.54 472.71 A: i think they have 

474.23 475.63 A: a volunteer day 

476.66 479.41 A: it seems to me like when you read the parades newspaper 

480.02 480.52 B: uh-huh 

480.86 483.25 A: you know that you get in the sunday paper the the little 

484.45 488.15 A: uh magazine thing the parade they have the volunteer stuff in there 

485.19 486.27 B: right right 

490.14 491.57 A: boy that's 

491.11 492.12 B: boy i'm like 

491.82 493.07 A: big question 

495.94 499.19 B: all i know is i don't want it to be about money 

498.45 500.62 A: exactly me too i really feel 

500.95 502.42 A: just the same as you on that 

502.55 507.37 A: to make it something that that would re- really make people think 

507.47 509.08 A: you know appreciate 

508.98 509.78 B: right 

509.60 512.64 A: and and be active about their life in the world 

514.20 518.00 A: so i don't know what that day would be or what you'd call it
