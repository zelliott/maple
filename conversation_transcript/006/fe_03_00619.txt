270.66 271.22 A: oh 

271.27 273.28 B: years ago so she's kind of like feels 

272.22 272.75 A: yeah 

273.80 279.07 B: feels bad to have to admit that she told a uh lie 

279.17 282.38 A: yeah a huge lie to right 

279.47 280.56 B: like that but 

280.89 284.31 B: yeah really i'm like (( )) you are all old enough you can 

284.85 285.37 A: yeah 

285.07 292.57 B: one of these years you ought to just get it off your chest i would want to if i had done that you know i'm like i don't really care myself

327.27 328.58 B: yeah you can and 

328.93 331.44 B: what does this do is that all you do 

332.45 334.39 B: do we punch any more buttons 

334.57 339.77 A: i don't think so i think the conversation is supposed to last to last like ten minutes or something 

339.90 340.66 B: really 

340.00 342.47 A: and i guess we just have to wait -til you know the

447.33 453.70 B: i don't know everybody is different but i'd rather when it's my folks i'd rather n- uh or even me 

453.94 454.47 A: yeah 

454.46 456.72 B: i don't know do you have any kids or anything um 

456.33 459.44 A: no no i'm i'm twenty one 

459.09 460.00 B: are you cool 

459.76 460.74 A: (( i don't have any ))

461.11 462.33 A: kids yet 

462.25 470.55 B: yeah well you probably will definitely eventually so when you do i've got some and when you do you're like 

471.20 474.41 B: this you know me as a mother especially 

473.81 474.21 A: mhm 

474.58 476.68 B: uh if i was going to die 

477.48 484.74 B: or if i'm going to die duh when when i die i would rather know a little bit ahead of time 

485.31 487.07 B: if i could if i had a choice 

486.91 491.51 A: yeah but it's it's really scary though to know in advance like because it means that 

488.74 489.09 B: (( )) 

491.99 497.11 A: i don't know -cause how ever much we know that we are going to that one day it's not really real until

496.82 498.14 B: yeah you are right 

499.93 500.48 A: there you go 

504.17 504.76 A: yeah 

504.62 514.39 B: but we could die at any age so if you start thinking about those little kids with cancer and they are just so hard to watch like if you see a show 

506.35 506.93 A: yeah 

509.17 509.73 A: mhm 

514.31 514.74 A: mhm 

515.03 517.66 B: on maybe lifetime or whatever something 

518.17 523.44 B: about the young ones even that have cancer they are trying to be so brave you know 

522.38 523.02 A: yeah 

523.75 524.66 B: i- i- n- 

524.87 526.79 B: uh half of them are going to die 

526.54 527.20 A: yeah 

527.40 533.11 B: and they are going to die so young but they n- but that's is what i'm you know so it's k- yeah it is hard to
