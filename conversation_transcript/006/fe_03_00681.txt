18.72 24.18 A: you know some people get indignant about being checked but it doesn't bother me at all it makes me fell safer that they are checked 

30.55 31.05 A: yeah 

30.82 35.54 B: so that we don't have any problems in if i see (( )) future um 

45.30 48.33 B: airlines to major airlines too 

47.45 52.34 A: oh absolutely i don't think it's the end all and it cures everything but i definitely believe it's going to make things better 

52.36 54.18 B: absolutely absolutely 

54.53 55.18 A: have you flown 

55.26 57.93 B: um unfortunately no 

58.10 64.00 B: but um looking forward to in february we'll be flying so yes yes 

62.30 62.88 A: oh good 

63.58 70.64 A: yeah i was a little apprehensive about it until i go to the airport and i saw so much security they did have with the bags and everything else i really did 

65.19 65.64 B: surely 

69.31 69.70 B: mhm 

70.72 71.07 B: mhm 

71.54 74.06 A: a good job and i was flying during the holiday time so 

73.78 74.41 B: oh 

74.31 74.95 A: more so 

75.70 77.89 B: an and people were a little apprehensive 

84.39 88.66 A: said a couple people didn't want to be bothered but for the most part everybody was very obliging you know (( )) 

84.77 85.16 B: mhm 

89.96 91.06 B: they really were huh 

91.14 91.45 A: yeah 

91.41 92.67 B: i'm glad to hear that though 

92.47 92.77 A: yeah 

92.85 96.02 B: yeah sure well that's something that's good 

96.06 96.86 A: uh-huh yeah 

96.97 98.24 A: i think it makes the difference 

98.21 103.37 B: i hope so i hope so so we don't have anything as tragic as we did in the past 

103.01 103.83 A: oh that was awful 

109.01 109.75 A: oh my god 

114.23 114.97 A: oh my god 

115.37 118.14 B: so right now yes i do (( )) 

118.28 118.72 B: so 

119.06 122.82 A: yeah so i mean i i live in the area too and i was actually 

123.20 127.43 A: on bed rush watching it on t._v. when it happened i thought i was seeing things i couldn't believe that 

125.47 125.76 B: ah 

125.95 126.33 B: mhm 

128.46 130.18 B: you just hope it means something 

130.43 131.72 B: that we've learned from 

131.89 134.35 B: this and you know things will get better 

134.54 136.63 A: yeah well the reason that i said something like that 

136.56 137.20 B: yeah 

136.75 138.58 A: feel bad for them to actually put in (( )) 

138.79 143.92 A: for security is ridiculous you know because they really just let you get on and off planes and nobody ever really stopped anybody 

144.51 147.21 B: uh and i wonder if it will happen if um 

147.47 154.77 B: if shorter flights if they were still watching for you know littler flights as well as you know overseas or what have you 

155.35 157.98 A: well they should because it really i mean a flight is a fight but 

158.12 158.50 B: mhm 

158.14 160.55 A: you know i mean i guess they were using the long ones for the 

161.12 161.88 A: (( fuel tank )) but 

161.72 162.07 B: mhm 

164.70 165.35 A: (( project result )) 

167.05 168.28 A: you know if there was like in 

168.60 170.12 A: you know not as big of a building but 

168.68 169.09 B: sure 

170.00 174.62 B: absolutely no matter what it is sure it could be it is devastating sure 

176.32 178.52 B: um what else could we say about it 

178.85 180.30 B: what else could we say 

180.74 182.14 B: i i just think it should be 

190.85 191.13 A: (( )) 

193.26 193.67 B: and that 

194.03 202.33 B: if that's the way it has to be it's a terrible thing in today's day and age you know that we have to go through such a a security issue you know 

202.19 209.56 A: oh i volunteered because i had boots on and i said i have boots do you want me to take them off and they said do they have metal zippers and i said yes they're like absolutely (( remove your boots )) 

202.44 202.78 B: but 

209.46 210.14 B: see 

216.38 224.22 B: like you said that i- i- it's much more advantageous to go through a a little bit of you know delay for for something that could 

224.34 225.61 B: can can save us 

225.89 226.37 B: so 

226.44 230.54 A: oh sure and even when they serve you the meal on the plane we got a plastic knife 

230.83 232.66 A: there was like two knives in every package 

232.83 233.19 B: huh 

233.19 234.53 A: but it was a plastic one so they g- 

234.24 238.26 B: and you got a meal on a plane (( )) 

237.44 240.31 A: oh yeah i w- i was flying out to california 

239.96 241.36 B: uh that's what it is 

241.02 242.34 A: so yeah it was a long flight 

242.55 251.62 B: no i'm only going from new york to florida so if i'm lucky if i get peanuts i don't think so maybe maybe a little flight so 

251.35 251.98 A: uh-huh 

251.72 253.16 B: and that's 

253.52 254.30 B: uh-huh 

255.73 261.30 A: oh you have to do it my family is out there so i have no choice but to go back and forth but it took me awhile to get up the nerve to do it 

261.33 264.52 B: oh so you so you do go back and forth quite a bit huh 

264.43 267.74 A: yeah i do well i hadn't since that happened because i i 

264.76 265.25 B: (( )) 

267.87 269.39 A: just recently had a baby so 

269.14 270.75 B: oh how nice 

270.28 273.42 A: we weren't flying for awhile but i was that made me even more nervous 

273.50 276.78 A: take an infant on the plane i was like oh god what if something happens you know 

274.68 275.50 B: sure sure 

275.99 283.09 B: and do they request or do you know that they request that that the child has a seat too or if it's a little one they don't 

282.96 286.24 A: um she didn't have to because she was only nine months old 

286.50 289.35 B: oh and once you can hold her then that would be okay 

289.18 295.64 A: right yeah if you could hold her it's okay so we didn't because we were able to hold her and she wouldn't have sat on the seat on the plane anyway for that long 

291.11 291.48 B: yeah 

295.32 295.89 B: huh 

296.61 304.68 A: but you know it was even more because i was afraid of i was like well you know when i'm taking my own life in my hands getting on a plane is one thing but now i'm taking somebody else's life too you know 

302.79 303.80 B: (( )) the baby 

304.12 309.66 B: sure it's always what we're saying not the baby not my kid 

307.71 307.99 A: so 

308.25 310.12 A: exactly i mean they took everything check 

309.89 310.29 B: that 

310.28 313.56 A: stroller they went across the whole stroller they you know opened and looked at it 

313.31 313.75 B: wow 

314.78 315.65 B: that's something 

316.30 319.94 A: and um you know i'd flown over seas a while ago and um 

319.11 319.70 B: mhm 

320.07 321.15 A: well before this happened 

321.70 323.87 A: and they actually (( )) 

324.09 331.86 A: airports in asia they would actually if you had a camera they would take it and take a picture with it to make sure it was actually a camera and you didn't have a bomb in it in the shape of a camera 

330.83 340.83 B: well somebody i just heard said that you can't travel with exposed film or there was something about oh i forgot what she said 

341.15 344.29 B: the the case that it's in and it can't be 

344.49 350.88 B: loaded or something like you said it can't be loaded (( )) in the film and if it is you have to prove that it's film and that kind of thing 

350.61 358.85 A: right yeah that's what they did they took the camera out and they saw that we had a film a roll of film that wasn't finished so they said well the only way we'll let you take it through is if you let us take a picture with it 

358.06 358.47 B: huh 

359.24 361.83 B: see i wonder if i'll get that in february 

361.95 362.48 B: when i was 

362.13 362.40 A: so 

362.78 363.65 A: i got a picture of us 

363.75 365.75 A: standing at the airport gate 

366.33 369.10 A: but at least i go to take my pictures home with me 

368.68 369.27 B: good 

369.45 373.26 B: yeah sure they could have confiscated that and who knows you know 

372.33 376.81 A: yeah i wasn't even thinking you know i figured it's a camera you know i knew it was a camera but 

375.65 376.39 B: mm 

377.89 378.94 A: don't know who has what 

391.56 398.47 B: anything as massive as we had and now they've you know taken all these precautions and try to 

398.80 399.31 B: you know 

399.62 403.91 B: even it out but it's not all employees kind of thing and you know 

403.41 404.96 A: no they can't point fingers 

418.88 419.54 A: well i yeah 

419.81 422.93 A: so that's true yeah no nobody it was very lax but 

422.60 423.23 B: yeah sure 

423.37 428.35 A: it was a common i i think it was just a combination of airport security in general they can't just say oh 

428.60 434.39 A: these people or those people i think it was a combination of all of them not checking anything including the people that you buy you know the ticket agent 

434.60 434.97 B: mhm 

435.33 437.03 A: you think when somebody buys a one way tic- 

436.96 437.31 B: sure 

437.29 438.90 A: cash that would really say something 

439.17 443.55 B: yeah and now now they they must question it much more than they have in the past 

443.17 443.68 A: oh yeah 

443.70 451.08 B: and i wonder if the computer has anything to do with it or the you know the internet and being able to purchase tickets and you know that kind of thing 

451.71 452.01 A: oh that 

452.13 452.97 A: true i didn't even think of that 

453.13 459.48 B: yeah sure they you know but hopefully they'll they'll proof they'll look for i._d._s. who checked your bag and those kind of 

459.62 464.82 B: you know little questions that they ask you and that can be the deciding 

465.01 465.63 B: hopefully 

474.89 475.18 A: yeah 

475.62 479.04 B: i it's just something that you feel more comfortable knowing that 

479.22 480.83 B: if it does take a little more time 

481.12 486.64 B: then i'm comfortable with it and i can deal with it patience is a virtue don't they say so 

485.34 486.38 A: right definitely 

486.47 492.34 A: definitely worth it i you know i think it's ridiculous that people get aggravated about it i mean it's trying to protect their own life 

487.46 487.82 B: mhm 

492.52 492.85 B: mhm 

494.51 500.45 A: but people do you know on the plane people were looking at each other you know and that was natural i mean i was looking around too but i mean 

499.89 500.32 B: sure 

500.72 503.98 A: you know what does somebody look like you don't know could look like anything you know 

502.31 502.70 B: mhm 

503.54 504.38 B: that's right yeah 

504.55 504.85 B: yeah 

505.72 511.10 B: don't we teach our children that strangers can be any kind you know that's it so 

509.48 509.90 A: yeah 

511.68 517.18 A: yeah somebody told me that in work one day you know i work in a large firm and there are some people who jus- 

518.23 518.71 B: mhm 

518.46 521.02 A: people that you wouldn't associate with outside of the firm or whatever
