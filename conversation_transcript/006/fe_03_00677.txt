108.70 110.29 B: yeah 

109.82 112.41 A: uh they should have did that a long time ago you 

112.10 114.11 B: yeah yeah 

113.35 115.19 A: know a long time ago 

114.94 115.87 B: yeah 

115.39 120.67 A: um the machines they come out with now cost a million dollars something like that 

120.02 121.53 B: yeah 

120.85 123.93 A: and they should have did that a long time ago when lockerbie 

123.95 125.54 A: got blown out of the sky 

125.31 127.00 B: yeah 

126.18 127.05 A: (( okay )) 

127.30 131.22 A: the cabin door goes into the cockpit

135.31 137.07 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

136.79 144.56 A: okay but then again you have to wonder if they have a steel door or not okay would that help okay because 

138.63 139.60 B: yeah 

141.01 142.51 B: if yeah 

142.99 144.08 B: yeah 

144.70 149.41 A: in the passenger compartment okay you got pilots and navigator in the cockpit right 

148.82 149.75 B: right 

149.52 151.91 A: okay you've got over a hundred people 

152.14 155.86 A: in the passenger compartment right plus stewardesses okay 

154.00 154.83 B: (( yes )) 

155.63 156.80 B: yeah 

156.21 159.16 A: they could use all them as hostages to get into the cockpit 

158.94 160.28 B: oh definitely 

160.12 161.47 A: but so 

160.69 161.83 B: yeah 

161.79 162.62 A: now 

163.44 166.47 A: i would put federal marshalls

170.53 171.63 A: in the plane 

171.55 173.73 B: yeah yeah and i think 

172.80 175.52 A: the pilot and the co-pilot should not carry guns 

175.30 176.55 B: yeah 

175.87 178.19 A: okay because they're not trained 

177.65 178.74 B: right 

178.47 182.00 A: if they were trained unless they're a vietnam vet or something like that 

179.28 180.33 B: yeah 

181.43 183.75 B: well it could get in the wrong hands too 

183.31 189.74 A: exactly it could get in the wrong hands no the steel door is good okay but they still should have federal marshalls 

185.10 186.40 B: yeah 

186.88 187.86 B: yeah 

189.42 190.35 B: (( yes ))

431.17 436.68 A: airplanes one thing about the secur- security is one thing okay but maintenance is another 

436.47 438.04 B: that's right 

437.33 444.94 A: uh they fly them planes so quick they land they take off and that and the maintenance people don't have time 

444.42 446.09 B: to check 'em out 

445.86 447.00 A: right 

446.46 447.53 B: (( uh-huh )) 

447.53 452.25 A: and as far as the uh baggage you know when they put the baggage outside the airplane there 

452.38 454.41 A: should be federal agents there too 

454.13 459.60 B: all right 'cause you don't know what's happening from the time that's yeah 

459.26 460.83 A: with an xray machine 

461.14 462.95 A: okay and that's 

461.14 462.15 B: yeah 

462.99 465.44 A: and because ever since nine eleven 

465.21 466.50 B: yeah 

465.89 467.52 A: flying went downhill 

467.35 468.74 B: yeah

472.34 473.86 B: yeah 

473.50 475.66 A: now's a good time to buy an airline 

475.42 476.73 B: yeah 

476.11 478.33 A: you know if you've got the money [laughter] you know 

477.68 478.83 B: (( right )) 

478.38 485.37 A: it's like at the there's a couple of small airlines that with that blue something or another i don't exactly remember 

485.68 490.82 A: but they fly for cheap because their maintenance is up their security 

489.54 490.23 B: yeah 

490.46 491.46 B: yeah 

491.47 492.41 A: (( you know )) 

492.55 493.75 B: yeah 

492.66 495.06 A: they should put federal marshalls all over the place 

494.74 496.32 B: yeah 

495.70 497.64 A: and if anybody has a gun or 

498.08 500.72 A: ah or even dogs 

500.60 501.55 B: yeah 

501.29 503.19 A: dogs are the best 

503.35 509.12 A: security because of their smell sense of smell their sense of smell is so 

506.75 508.16 B: right 

509.67 513.75 A: so great i mean they could sniff out they can sniff out anything 

513.18 514.77 B: yeah 

513.98 516.65 A: i mean it's probably even better than them xray machines 

516.63 520.41 B: right right 'cause sometimes they could yeah 

520.09 521.72 A: or you could have both you 

521.64 522.65 B: yeah 

521.79 523.61 A: know oh what the hell have both 

523.46 524.57 B: there you go 

524.69 525.69 B: (( double )) 

525.70 526.90 B: yeah 

527.07 528.81 A: (( so that's my opinion )) 

528.82 529.85 B: yeah 

530.35 531.54 A: (( and but know what )) 

531.69 538.02 A: i don't care what you do i don't care what kind of security you got i don't care what they do how much money they spend 

533.07 534.16 B: yeah 

538.57 540.18 A: you can't prevent it 

539.92 541.53 B: yeah 

540.70 542.38 A: (( you cannot prevent it )) 

541.78 543.45 B: yeah 

542.61 544.94 A: you know so if if if you let 

544.04 544.69 B: (( [mn] )) 

545.15 554.07 A: even if they have security at the airport and everything and everybody feels safe and everything there's nothing if it's going to happen its going to happen 

547.57 549.00 B: yeah 

551.30 552.62 B: yeah 

553.42 554.86 B: it's going to happen yeah 

554.85 563.68 A: just like um you ta- it's like say you have a car it's a hard top versus you have a car that's a convertible okay 

562.48 563.50 B: right 

563.79 566.81 A: in summertime you have ah like say 

566.91 570.70 A: a c._d. disk in your convertible and your hard top okay 

570.40 571.26 B: uh-huh 

570.80 576.05 A: now are you going to leave like at night you're going to lock up the hard top right 

575.47 576.54 B: (( yeah right )) 

576.08 577.31 A: if you want now 

577.55 582.13 A: if you have a convertible okay what are you going to do are you going to leave the top down or up 

581.60 582.63 B: right 

582.71 583.50 B: (( yeah )) 

582.85 585.02 A: uh you going to leave it up or down 

584.91 587.44 B: (( uh you're probably going to put it up but )) 

587.30 588.90 A: okay it really don't matter 

588.31 589.84 B: it doesn't matter right 

589.83 596.55 A: because take a knife and cut it open i'd rather leave it down because it costs more money to replace the rag top than it does a c._d. 

596.83 599.89 B: (( oh there you go yeah yeah )) 

599.33 599.89 A: (( player ))
