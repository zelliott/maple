267.08 268.02 B: but 

268.38 272.89 B: you know it turned out to be great i mean of course there's your rocky times 

273.06 278.15 B: and your good times but now it's just like everything is good so 

277.34 281.56 A: mhm well once you get to know that person really well

284.12 285.80 B: oh it does 

285.16 286.41 A: it really does 

286.11 287.86 B: it does um

290.71 291.82 B: i don't 

291.92 298.40 B: i mean i don't condone people to get married you know after they've known somebody for a year or 

298.58 303.91 B: you know six months or whatever but it takes it's like you said it's takes so much longer 

303.91 305.00 A: mhm 

304.22 308.37 B: to get to know and to trust somebody because they can cover up for years 

308.35 309.36 A: oh yeah 

308.96 310.63 B: you know their own 

310.66 311.84 B: traits 

312.04 313.30 A: that's right 

313.06 314.80 B: and personalities 

315.28 318.92 A: yeah discovered that with the last one it took a while [laughter] 

317.03 318.04 B: mhm 

318.53 322.60 B: yeah i was with mine for uh well i was eighteen 

322.71 333.55 B: when i first got with him and he was ten years older and um i should have known that from the get go but i was too naive and young i guess immature 

333.66 340.40 B: to realize it and it took you know a good eight ten years to figure out hey i don't need to be here 

333.67 334.63 A: mhm 

340.44 341.41 A: yeah 

340.99 349.58 B: and then another kid later you know a kid later and he'd already been married had two kids and [mn] 

349.35 354.56 A: yeah gosh i i guess i was lucky i'd i'd never wanted to have kids with with my last one 

354.57 357.38 B: oh you're luck- well mine kinda just happened 

357.03 358.19 A: yeah 

357.66 369.27 B: you know i um we were still just living together and i got pregnant and my mother was kinda like you'd better get married type thing and it was like okay 

367.74 369.08 A: mhm 

369.84 375.83 B: be good to yourself do the right thing and then when she found out what was going on she was like oh i'm so sorry 

375.63 377.46 A: oh no mhm 

376.50 384.26 B: so but you know you always learn from your experiences too i have no at this point of my life i have nothing negative 

384.30 386.91 B: to even say about him um 

387.42 389.54 B: i got a great child out it 

389.91 390.82 A: yeah 

390.02 396.61 B: you know he's a very good he's a hard worker he's a good worker he you know 

396.66 398.72 B: loves his mom [laughter] 

398.16 400.04 A: mhm well that's good 

399.75 401.85 B: which is great you know so 

401.94 409.37 A: yeah funny you're talking about your your previous husband being ten years older mine was fourteen years older [noise] 

408.52 409.75 B: really 

409.42 411.70 A: yeah [noise] so i wonder maybe just the 

412.59 414.28 A: um such a big 

414.39 417.05 A: gap in the ages i don't know 

416.89 428.89 B: [mn] well i know for me i was very insecure um my parents were divorced when i was very young and [mn] you know i didn't have my dad around as much as i wanted to 

428.97 436.24 B: and um my mom was dating somebody else so you know she wasn't around so i figure that's probably what my thing was 

429.18 430.20 A: mhm 

436.57 447.59 A: yeah well my parents were divorced when i was three and i i come from scotland and my father was my father was american i've lived here for eleven years now 

440.03 441.18 B: yeah 

442.97 444.20 B: oh really 

447.20 448.18 B: uh-huh 

447.99 453.55 A: and when i when i was three my mother took my sister and i back to scotland so 

453.97 456.91 A: i don't know maybe just needing 

457.28 460.56 A: another father figure i guess [laughter] maybe that's what it was 

458.92 462.46 B: yeah exactly being the older older guy 

462.44 469.47 A: mhm but i did have a stepfather and he's wonderful um he came into my life when i was about four 

470.33 471.71 B: [mn] well that's great 

470.38 471.69 A: but i guess 

472.00 480.27 A: not not quite the same as your your own father at the time but not until you look back you know that i realized that he was more of a father than my real father was 

476.09 477.11 B: right 

479.81 480.91 B: mhm 

480.66 488.61 A: you know we would get a christmas card and a birthday card with twenty dollars in it every year and that was about the only contact that we ever had with him 

488.50 489.75 B: oh boy 

489.61 491.47 A: so yep 

491.79 494.70 B: well i had a stepdad too but he was not 

495.00 495.80 B: (( [mn] )) 

495.92 498.50 B: i did not like him and um 

498.70 508.38 B: even when my mom passed away several years ago it's been about eleven twelve years now my sister ended up keeping in contact with him 

504.71 505.60 A: mhm 

508.39 509.59 B: and um 

509.83 519.60 B: it really kinda irritates me or irritated me and then he passed away last year and my sister kept saying are you not gonna go even talk to him and it's like no 

519.78 526.96 B: [mn] you know he left my mom when she had breast cancer and he was living with another woman you know i don't find that 

519.97 521.24 A: mhm 

524.43 525.32 A: (( gosh )) 

527.43 530.88 B: a good attribute you know [laughter] so we've 

527.51 528.63 A: no 

529.23 531.38 A: no no [laughter] 

531.13 535.23 B: (( you know [mn] i just say you know it was like uh-uh )) 

535.39 536.67 B: no way 

536.70 537.78 A: (( no )) 

537.71 538.70 B: (( so )) 

539.13 545.65 A: i guess it would be different if it was your real father you know you might have that kinda connection there but you would you know 

543.82 545.38 B: oh i think so 

545.44 547.45 B: you'd still be mad but 

547.91 552.45 B: it it'd still be your real dad you know so to speak your
