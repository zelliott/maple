0.91 1.49 B: hello 

1.71 2.72 A: hello 

2.28 3.49 B: hi my name rita 

3.73 5.73 A: hi rite i'm ingrid how are you 

4.91 6.47 B: hi fine and yourself 

6.63 7.24 A: good 

7.22 11.78 B: so i guess we are supposed to talk about do we believe that airport security 

12.49 14.89 B: lessens chance of terrorism is that correct 

15.00 17.88 A: lessens chance of terrorism that's what i understand 

17.62 19.78 B: okay i don't think it does 

20.00 21.99 A: you don't think that it does 

21.60 22.24 B: no 

23.23 29.60 B: and the reason that i don't this so is because we already had heighten security at different airport 

30.09 33.03 B: and someone still manages to either hijack the plane 

33.44 33.75 B: get 

34.30 35.59 B: sometime of of 

35.78 37.52 B: metal object on the plane 

37.65 38.06 A: yeah 

38.17 42.82 B: or something along that line i mean there's just always sometime going on so 

43.17 44.84 B: i don't think if they heighten 

44.94 47.40 B: security i think it just makes your wait longer 

48.33 49.33 A: well i think that it 

49.55 52.08 A: i think that it it might deter 

54.15 57.05 A: like my copy cat tor- or terrorists 

57.12 57.69 B: okay 

58.01 60.73 A: but i think people who are 

61.12 67.23 A: bound and determined to do it like the nine eleven hijackers i think they are going to find a way 

62.02 63.31 B: exactly 

63.86 65.43 B: right right 

67.73 68.62 A: around 

68.77 69.68 A: the security 

69.42 70.15 B: exactly 

70.62 74.16 A: um now i do think now my husband is a business traveler 

74.19 74.78 B: okay 

74.94 75.59 A: and 

76.33 79.82 A: you the security measures have made his business travel 

80.04 80.70 A: just 

80.94 81.67 A: horrible 

81.61 82.62 B: right exactly 

83.28 90.26 A: so i mean i i'm myself have experienced having to go and take off my shoes because of metal plates that are in shoes 

89.24 90.71 B: right right 

91.02 94.81 A: i think that a possible solution for people who um 

95.59 96.74 A: you domestic 

97.17 104.28 A: or you know citizens of our country if if if they travel on a um regular basis i think they could 

98.36 98.83 B: yes 

104.46 106.45 A: get some type of security card 

106.69 107.92 B: right that's a good idea 

108.14 112.99 B: or something with your fingerprint on it or voice activated somewhere along that type of measure 

108.32 108.74 A: or 

112.73 116.95 A: yeah or even your eye you know you've seen in movies how they um 

114.59 115.35 B: right 

117.23 120.32 B: use the cornea of your eye to color right 

118.40 121.84 A: the cornea and right and all that stuff like 

121.16 123.27 B: i think those are very good ideas because 

123.50 127.33 B: basically i think that they just put the security out there because they really 

128.02 130.07 B: i don't think they knew how to handle the problem 

130.43 131.50 A: no i don't either 

131.64 134.72 B: and i think that it came so fast well not so fast because 

134.92 136.15 B: it had happened before 

136.84 139.31 B: i mean he bin laden had done something like this 

139.41 140.22 B: previously 

140.91 141.44 B: and 

141.65 148.37 B: they just really didn't know what to do i guess they just i don't to me i think they just sat back and said okay he didn't once he won't do it again 

148.81 154.99 B: you you know so we really don't have to do anything and then it happened again and we lost so many lives so 

155.12 161.56 B: to make it look like the government is really doing something that's important let's put servicemen because i was in the army 

161.83 162.27 A: uh-huh 

162.31 166.45 B: so let's put service men out there and give the people a sense of security 

166.93 171.59 B: but to me my sense of security kind of waned when it happened in the first place 

172.33 173.41 A: yeah definitely 

173.68 180.88 A: the the i think the sense of security for our whole country because i think that we all felt that we were untouchable 

180.96 181.66 B: exactly 

181.51 184.33 A: things like this didn't happen on american soil 

184.47 186.06 A: they happened other places 

186.40 188.02 A: they didn't not here 

186.44 187.65 B: but not here right 

188.41 188.91 B: right 

188.95 191.25 A: exactly so ah ah i mean 

192.12 194.30 A: i don't know i i do think that they 

194.81 201.13 A: do need to have some kind of security measures in place because you are going to have the would be copy cat 

197.29 197.88 B: right 

200.75 202.11 B: exactly which you do 

202.30 205.49 A: which you do you know like that guy richard 

206.33 207.38 B: right 

207.12 209.98 A: um the french guy i can't recall his last name 

210.16 218.37 B: i don't know his last name either but i know exactly what you're talking about because there there seem to be more copy cats then the actually crime itself 

211.84 212.41 A: um 

218.57 218.92 A: right 

218.74 222.75 B: for people to get recognition or ah quote unquote their fifteen minutes of fame 

222.93 223.71 A: exactly 

231.21 239.37 B: slowing down production of of getting the people to move i mean it's like you said if someone really wants to do this it was already done 

239.85 240.18 A: yeah 

240.30 241.54 B: so it doesn't mean i mean 

241.96 243.68 B: to me they haven't even found 

243.93 246.60 B: the person that they're looking for who was responsible 

246.95 252.25 B: for it so it's it's nothing to say it can't happen again just because you have a hundred service men at the airport 

252.39 253.49 A: that's right and 

253.92 256.66 A: if they want to happen again they will find 

256.81 258.53 A: some way now 

266.15 271.08 A: caus- you know hassle causes us a hassle if it could deter someone 

268.26 268.65 B: right 

271.77 273.34 A: then i'm all for it even if 

272.71 273.61 B: exactly 

273.46 275.70 A: even if it is an inconvenience for me 

275.07 275.76 B: exactly 

276.41 279.82 A: eh you know if it if it is going to deter someone 

279.17 286.48 B: right i'd rather be inconvenienced then dead so i mean so i mean that is it it's just that 

282.51 283.49 A: exactly 

286.77 288.73 B: from from my following it it 

288.85 291.84 B: okay you have all this security but you still have no answers 

292.17 293.57 A: no we have no answers 

293.72 295.74 B: you know and so what you did was 

295.84 300.33 B: okay you heightened the security and now you're after ah saddam hussein but 

300.54 307.16 B: wait a minute wasn't it bin laden that you were you know that you were after first so i can't get him so i'll get someone else 

307.72 310.30 B: so it seems like the problem is being kind of shifted 

310.71 311.87 B: from place to place 

312.22 315.47 B: when it shouldn't have happened in the first place if we're supposed to be 

315.65 323.28 B: so much like the land of milk of honey and everybody comes here for opportunities and things there should be no way that someone is just able to take a plane and just 

323.50 324.78 B: crash it into a building 

325.17 326.58 A: well i think that 

326.69 329.67 A: you know they hate um they being 

330.30 330.91 A: um 

333.10 339.64 A: you know people from the arabic countries not to generalize or to 

334.56 335.59 B: right they do 

336.67 337.43 B: exactly 

339.80 340.10 A: to 

340.48 345.56 A: put everybody into on category but i guess the extremists they hate us 

342.39 343.01 B: right 

345.75 347.40 A: because of our 

347.61 350.16 A: you know because we are the land of milk and honey 

348.95 349.36 B: right 

349.52 349.96 B: right 

350.27 352.82 A: because we're arrogant americans we go 

352.01 354.32 B: exactly 

353.09 354.87 A: i mean there have been you know 

355.20 360.73 A: you watch the the reality shows on t._v. where the americans go to other countries and 

360.83 361.77 A: they're rude 

362.17 362.63 B: yes 

362.26 363.68 A: you know they have no 

364.15 365.05 A: um 

365.75 368.28 A: respect for the other cultures or 

369.02 373.53 A: you know i don't think that all americans are like that but i think that the ones who have 

373.93 377.21 A: you know acted like that have you know put us in a really 

374.38 375.17 B: exactly 

377.86 378.74 A: precarious 

378.93 380.46 A: position 

379.71 385.08 B: i mean they really have because i'm in i'm an undergrad at la salle university in philadelphia pennsylvania 

385.51 387.71 B: and i would like to go to amsterdam 

387.87 388.76 B: for grad school 

389.32 391.20 B: and that was always been a dream of mine but 

391.32 394.72 B: since everything has happened i will not leave the country 

395.56 399.50 B: because i still don't think because we have all the security it's safe 

395.66 396.24 A: yes 

399.87 401.52 A: yeah i don't think so either 

401.24 401.99 B: right and 

401.62 404.95 A: i think being an american out of the us is very 

404.57 405.31 B: exactly 

405.43 412.95 B: i don't really think it's safe and even to even traveling to go see my grandmother or something like that i refuse to get on a plane 

407.16 408.18 A: it's not safe 

413.36 418.07 B: and i know like i said that i was in the service and the service men and women are very capable 

418.37 419.90 B: of doing their jobs but 

420.56 423.30 B: it doesn't make me feel any better about the situation 

424.19 428.47 A: well i i have been traveling domestically not internationally 

428.88 429.95 A: and i would love 

430.16 432.68 A: you know i would love to go to indian i would love to go to 

433.78 442.30 A: thailand to all the other different but because there are the extreme you know the muslim extremist and radicals in different places you never know when 

442.56 445.42 A: they're going to decide to take an american hostage 

444.98 445.68 B: exactly 

446.12 446.80 A: and 

447.27 449.71 A: you know the the security that we have here 

450.20 452.95 A: is not the same security that are in other countries 

453.02 453.78 B: exactly 

453.65 454.64 A: definitely 

454.71 455.50 B: exactly 

455.25 456.88 A: not 

455.63 462.01 B: i mean i believe that we do have very good security i mean it it hasn't happened again but it happened 

462.32 463.49 A: yeah it did happen 

464.17 474.56 A: and you know if i i think that not only we need to heighten our airport security but we need to heighten the security of the people coming into our country 

473.92 475.25 B: exact- thank you 

475.61 479.02 B: thank you that's that's exactly it 

476.57 477.72 A: they you know 

478.15 489.20 A: why do you want to come you know who are why do you want to be here and i feel badly for the other countries they they're poor but at the same time 

481.00 482.92 B: thank you that's exactly it 

490.64 496.29 A: you know don't don't come here sorry we have to take car of our own first 

492.41 504.26 B: exactly i feel i i i i feel right i feel the same way i mean it seems like like like you said in a way you kind of feel like criminal your bag is being searched you have to take your shoes off 

502.30 502.84 A: right 

508.28 511.33 A: yep like i told you that my husband travels he um 

512.21 513.12 A: um just 

521.20 529.08 A: and um he took him tennis racket him this time well the people and the security gate said why is your bag so heavy on one end 

528.91 529.27 B: see 

529.84 536.06 A: and they went through and they totally went through his bad and he said i felt very violated 

535.63 536.31 B: exactly 

536.33 536.89 A: and 

537.03 539.22 A: you know he said you know the people at the counter 

540.01 546.19 A: you know i see these people every week and i'm i tried to explain they see hundreds of people every week 

545.72 546.28 B: right 

546.30 549.90 A: and he thinks that like somehow they should be able to flag the system 

550.75 553.80 A: the he is a frequent traveler so that the people who 

554.54 555.02 A: you know 

555.26 559.01 B: right and i understand because he feels like he's done something wrong 

555.29 556.78 A: who are the americans 

558.76 559.35 A: right 

559.13 567.52 B: you see come through here all the time i'm a u._s. i'm a constant traveler 

565.82 566.34 A: right 

567.72 568.36 B: a criminal 

568.60 569.27 A: right 

569.26 576.92 B: but like you said it should be the other way around people that are coming into the united states should have to go through all this security checks 

576.77 580.15 A: they should go have to jump through hoops and 

578.89 581.14 B: exactly exactly 

580.83 583.12 A: everything else and you know 

582.82 585.07 B: because it makes you feel like well wait a minute 

585.18 590.89 B: i was violated my sense of security has been damaged but i'm being treated like 

591.26 591.95 B: the criminal 

592.22 592.99 A: right 

592.27 593.47 B: instead of the victim 

594.07 594.52 A: right
