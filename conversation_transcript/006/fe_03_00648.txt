208.78 215.60 B: and then my husband got one when i wasn't here and then i got another one like five minutes before i was leaving for work so i couldn't really do 

215.83 220.85 B: any of those so i was really happy when they finally called and i actually had the time to do it 

220.53 222.63 A: well i think i've missed uh 

222.86 224.97 A: uh let's see there was uh 

225.83 229.00 A: i don't know if it was this morning there was about three calls 

229.07 230.43 A: but it just said 

230.94 233.01 A: penn university or something 

232.69 233.97 B: right 

233.38 237.05 A: and i was expecting a a one eight hundred 

237.94 239.81 A: penn or one eight hun- the 

239.93 242.84 A: eight hundred number but that wasn't what showed up 

242.35 243.77 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

243.25 245.53 A: and then i was on the internet last year 

245.46 248.63 B: and it said about how it wasn't 

248.13 257.19 A: and it came over my call wave you know that but there was anything i could do then i was on the internet but i've i've probably missed about four of 'em 

250.03 252.05 B: (( right [noise] )) 

257.18 258.91 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

259.44 263.43 A: do they pay you when [laughter] i guess we're supposed to be talking about that other thing

267.23 269.56 B: um i'm not sure when 

271.00 273.67 B: that happens [mn] 

274.53 285.67 B: i don't know if you know they're doing this for so long and then you'll get paid at the end of whenever they're done or if they send you a check after every single one that you do i'm not really sure 

286.04 288.43 A: wonder what the purpose is i mean 

289.16 293.98 B: i think it's a a university and they're doing some sort of research project 

293.00 293.87 A: (( mhm )) 

294.64 296.85 A: so they are they taping us [laughter]

305.03 306.50 A: well i don't know what 

306.66 313.76 A: i don't know what uh now the other day i think i couldn't have talked about it e- either because they told me the topic was uh 

314.34 315.14 A: uh 

315.33 317.42 A: lasting relationships or 

317.06 318.48 B: life partners

319.18 322.29 B: yeah that was the one that my husband got 

321.64 326.40 A: [laughter] and i've been divorced for about nine years so i 

326.05 327.34 B: oh really 

326.66 329.19 A: i couldn't have really jumped in that one either 

329.69 330.64 B: (( nope )) 

330.87 331.93 A: (( so uh )) 

332.02 334.47 A: i mean i don't know a whole lot about this uh 

334.96 338.86 A: nine eleven thing except for what i've seen on t._v. and 

338.32 339.54 B: mhm 

338.98 341.79 A: i mean you know i never did fly before 

341.42 342.38 B: right 

342.16 343.34 A: and 

342.75 345.32 B: were you at home when it happened 

344.68 345.62 A: (( um )) 

346.88 352.10 A: yes and i forget who call- oh i know i was i was on my way to a 

352.23 355.89 A: (( county about twenty five miles and i had my radio on )) 

355.48 356.72 B: mhm 

356.12 359.56 A: and they were talking about it but i didn't think it was 

359.92 361.57 A: a real thing you know 

361.25 362.30 B: right 

362.30 365.28 A: because i think when i when it was on there it was when uh 

365.44 367.53 A: the plane hit the second building 

367.22 368.91 B: mhm 

368.61 372.00 A: and the weather i mean the news guy was saying 

372.16 373.94 A: that another plane 

373.96 377.63 A: (( had hit the other tower and i wasn't sure what he was talking about )) 

377.12 379.02 B: mhm 

378.20 379.25 A: (( and uh )) 

379.40 383.92 A: you know i listened a little bit and then when i got back i stopped at my sister's and she was watching it 

384.00 385.23 A: on t._v. 

384.75 386.55 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

385.52 392.91 A: but i didn't know you know what it was or anything till i got back because i thought it was just some kind of story on the radio i didn't think it was 

393.38 395.09 A: something was really happening 

394.63 396.11 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

397.20 400.67 A: but no i don't guess it's affected my life much except um 

400.92 403.35 A: (( really don't want to do again and )) 

402.70 403.74 B: right 

404.09 406.39 A: then after every time you hear a plane 

405.87 407.39 B: mhm 

406.98 408.99 A: [laughter] you know it's kinda scary 

408.75 412.18 B: yeah it is especially once they fly low 

412.25 413.23 A: mhm 

412.50 415.82 B: you know that always makes me kinda nervous 

416.23 417.56 A: but that's uh 

417.67 419.10 A: (( i guess that's the only thing )) 

420.02 423.61 A: how it's affected me is that i'm scared to death to have to hear an airplane go over 

423.62 426.03 A: i'm really afraid you know of them attacking 

426.08 427.26 A: (( again )) 

426.85 428.09 B: mhm 

427.38 428.89 A: because they said 

429.01 430.85 A: something about if uh 

432.27 434.59 A: if we bomb over there 

434.11 435.40 B: mhm 

434.77 436.19 A: (( that the )) 

436.69 439.27 A: the twin towers would have looked like a 

440.82 442.67 A: a fire cracker or 

442.25 443.31 B: mhm 

442.74 444.89 A: something compared to what they would do 

446.74 448.77 A: so that's a scary thought 

448.35 449.42 B: yeah 

451.39 453.16 A: but i'm afraid you know 

453.68 455.95 A: (( i'm just afraid of what will happen if they do )) 

455.69 456.69 B: right 

456.29 458.28 A: you know attack over there so i 

457.53 458.46 B: (( [cough] )) 

459.24 460.97 A: mean i hate to see even 

461.72 462.90 A: now i'm not i 

463.27 466.87 A: don't guess i'm supposed to get into anything like that but [laughter] 

469.66 471.72 B: i remember i was at home 

472.50 476.59 B: and i actually had the t._v. on 

476.87 479.38 B: (( so i saw it you know right when they started )) 

479.45 481.19 B: broadcasting it 

481.23 485.16 B: and my husband actually at the time was uh 

486.27 488.01 B: he was stockbroker 

488.49 491.53 B: so they sent him home because 

491.88 495.20 B: they when they you know obviously they shut down 

495.87 500.99 B: the nasdaq and everything in new york city on wall street so he couldn't do anything 

501.09 505.05 B: so and they ended up sending everybody home then 

504.77 507.09 A: is that far from where that is or 

505.09 505.65 B: (( [noise] )) 

507.43 508.31 B: um 

507.64 510.00 A: i'm not real familiar with new york 

509.67 513.23 B: yeah i'm right up by lake ontario 

515.53 518.23 B: have you ever heard of syracuse new york 

517.32 520.03 A: yeah i've heard of it but like i said i couldn't 

520.11 520.94 B: don't know 

520.14 522.87 A: i'm sure where everything is up there i mean 

521.69 522.69 B: right 

522.88 527.01 B: it's yeah it's probably three hundred miles away 

528.72 531.06 A: that's still pretty close home isn't it 

530.63 535.46 B: yeah a little closer than i would have liked to be 

535.00 536.06 A: yeah 

536.30 538.31 A: but there were there were uh 

538.34 540.45 A: a couple of other people from here 

540.57 542.27 A: in this town that was 

542.35 545.80 A: i think two of them no one other one worked in 

546.16 547.77 A: one of the towers 

547.92 553.84 A: and another one from here had an office down the street they had seen it all happen 

551.88 553.02 B: mhm 

553.64 555.22 B: oh really 

555.86 556.96 A: but uh 

557.29 559.13 A: (( no but as far as )) 

560.79 562.24 A: (( well i don't know )) 

564.57 566.75 B: i didn't know anybody that 

567.25 573.15 B: was either in the planes or in the towers or even saw it happen at all so 

573.68 575.89 B: which i guess is a good thing 

575.86 579.93 A: now you know this this guy that was in town everybody was talking about his 

580.06 581.32 A: grandson 

581.63 583.30 A: being on the 

583.45 585.01 A: on the one plane 

585.23 586.39 A: and uh 

587.25 590.49 A: i wanted to see him on t._v. when they had him on t._v. 

590.07 591.14 B: mhm 

590.88 591.78 A: (( uh )) 

592.22 595.23 A: because when he was here in town it was back 

595.46 597.35 A: i guess when i just uh 

598.85 599.89 A: was young because
