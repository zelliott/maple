72.43 74.58 A: oh well i don't either 

74.91 77.92 A: i have met some i think bio terrorists though 

78.24 87.26 A: i was coming back from a on a bus from pittsburgh and uh these people were here in the city that came in on a bus from buffalo 

87.49 89.76 A: and they wanted to go down town 

90.14 91.58 A: to the bay front 

92.01 95.42 A: and i said oh sure and they were in hiking shorts 

95.43 98.77 A: and they had back packs and they were from um 

100.93 103.29 A: ira- not iranian uh 

103.42 107.74 A: i can't think of the name of it now but it was some place in france 

107.29 108.14 B: uh-huh 

108.05 116.52 A: and uh they were here for the day they came in they said to the united to canada caught a greyhound 

116.64 123.47 A: and came across on the greyhound and nobody bothered them or asked them anything 

123.85 124.94 B: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

124.19 129.15 A: i'm iranian so it's not iranians it's something with an a._r. i can't think of what it is 

129.25 134.08 A: and that they were going to pittsburg and then they were going on to south america 

133.62 134.69 B: oh wow 

134.51 146.28 A: and so i mean i'm talking to 'em telling them about the bay front and so forth 'cause americans are told to be friendly you know for people uh uh foreigners in the country 

141.99 142.94 B: mhm 

146.35 155.30 A: and so a couple of months later when after all that happened i thought gee whiz they were talking about where they were coming in from 

155.84 156.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

155.94 159.50 A: and so i had to call the coastguard and tell 'em 

159.61 161.86 A: that i had talked to these uh 

162.21 165.58 A: men because there was two one spoke english and one didn't 

162.97 163.53 B: (( [mn] )) 

165.69 169.13 A: and that they said they came in from canada on the greyhound 

168.66 172.24 B: and with backpacks and everything and nobody checked them right 

171.77 173.21 A: nobody checked 'em 

172.84 174.10 B: (( wow you )) 

173.71 184.86 A: yeah and so that was right after that that they picked up those people in new york coming in on a greyhound and i thought well maybe my information helped a little 

180.87 181.60 B: (( know )) 

185.02 193.48 A: yeah because it happened that they had they were coming in from canada but buffalo i think it was where they picked them up or syracuse or somewhere up there 

193.84 196.02 B: it was the same two guys 

196.02 202.35 A: well no it was a different set because this was like two months after i had met them 

202.06 203.45 B: (( uh-hum )) 

202.81 207.93 A: that they were coming into the country that way but evidently nobody was checking them on the buses 

208.53 209.23 B: [mn] 

208.57 210.88 A: and so that's how they were coming in 

211.32 215.42 A: and i was i was so nervous about whether i should call whether it was 

215.45 216.38 A: (( you know )) 

216.76 220.03 A: did they take on some crazy lady [laughter] 

220.07 223.30 B: where to call or where to figure out who to call [mn] 

222.89 236.60 A: oh i did i didn't know who to call i called the uh f._b._i. they told me i called police stations and then they told me i think it was the f._b._i. and they told me i had to call the coastguard so i had to make like three phone calls 

236.81 239.13 A: before i could even turn 'em in 

239.78 241.37 A: you know what had happened 

241.08 242.02 B: (( uh-hum )) 

241.67 244.63 A: and then they uh they said uh 

245.07 249.01 A: what did they look like well after two months you know 

249.03 252.33 A: i mean i could give them a general idea and 

252.69 259.07 A: i told them i said that they wanted to know who i was i said i don't want to be involved in it i just want to report it 

258.62 259.47 B: right 

259.35 265.63 A: and i thought to myself yeah right they got caller i._d. there they know [laughter] who i am 

263.13 264.73 B: [laughter] 

264.94 268.85 B: they were probably tracing the call as you went as you called you know 

267.47 269.83 A: (( [mn] [laughter] so )) 

269.94 276.92 A: so anyway that i had run into that so i don't know except that for people to be alert 

276.99 282.32 A: because i was just waiting they were both waiting to catch a city bus into the city 

281.79 282.64 B: uh-huh 

282.62 287.00 A: and so they were asking me questions and so i just 

287.03 291.62 A: like i say we get a lot of tourists here and so just being a friendly 

292.74 297.60 A: guide so to speak [laughter] i thought gee whiz 

297.21 298.68 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

297.89 300.13 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

298.90 301.61 B: you could have been talking to terrorists right [laughter] 

300.82 307.56 A: yeah and i probably was i mean i don't know but seeing as how the way they laughed and said they came in 

307.91 312.05 A: from canada on the bus it just didn't dawn on me 

312.20 314.87 A: to realize they had to be checked 

314.35 315.37 B: right 

315.25 318.05 A: you know i just assumed they were 

318.19 330.91 A: but yet we go to canada all the time and nobody checks i mean they've got more so now but we're not that far from it so we go over to the casino and things like that you know 

330.63 331.49 B: right 

331.67 332.97 A: but as though 

333.26 337.46 A: i guess maybe make american public more aware 

337.88 342.72 A: of what the the which i think we all are now of what 

342.75 345.65 A: the procedure is to come into the country 

346.01 351.15 A: you know they're supposed to be checked and probed and so forth before they're 

351.19 352.67 A: they're they come in 

352.96 354.49 A: i don't know [laughter] 

354.20 361.74 B: it's gonna be hard for them to well just single these people out you know because they look like that or something or you know 

360.76 368.00 A: yeah well they spoke with an accent but i think everybody everybody when they come in from canada is supposed to be checked 

367.87 368.73 B: (( uh )) 

368.77 371.43 A: but they were letting the greyhound buses go 

372.61 373.23 A: (( through )) 

373.02 375.32 B: hm yeah that's scary [sigh] 

374.99 379.30 A: yeah and so it's uh they do check 'em now 

379.55 385.63 A: uh since that happened i mean they don't check every one but they have spot checks and that 

385.16 386.15 B: right 

386.00 390.93 A: but it is it's scary and see how it is they didn't look 

391.02 394.71 A: they just looked like regular people in hike 

394.74 398.15 A: except that they were dressed like you see europeans dress 

397.43 398.62 B: mhm 

398.40 404.85 A: in hiking shorts and the backpack and knee socks you know and so i was just figuring well 

405.57 409.66 A: they were just travelling through but i at that time i didn't know 

409.85 411.80 A: that they should have been checked 

411.47 412.40 B: right 

411.87 413.62 A: i mean i knew it 

413.84 416.26 A: but it didn't register with me 

416.30 419.32 A: you know you just figure they had been and that so 

419.63 421.09 A: other than that 

421.69 425.47 A: bio terrorism it's just i think just be aware 

426.13 427.73 A: of the people around you 

427.90 440.58 B: true and what well how you gonna stop somebody from you know if some guy goes and gives some other guy a million bucks saying here put this anthrax in this water supply here how are you gonna stop that 

428.60 429.38 A: beca- 

440.38 450.13 A: they're not going to i don't think so anyway i mean it's just like i said to one of my friends the other day are you still checking your mail 

441.61 442.53 B: [laughter] 

451.14 454.94 A: because when they did the anthrax everybody was so careful are you 

454.94 461.37 B: no [laughter] no and i get packages all the time i don't even think about it you know 

455.19 457.67 A: i'm not [laughter] 

460.54 470.28 A: right and i thought boy we're getting very complacent you know [laughter] 'cause i ask her too because uh she now she lives in the country i live in the city 

465.36 465.96 B: (( mm )) 

470.44 471.93 A: (( and you know when there was a )) 

472.25 479.56 A: before when i got my mail when it first happened i opened it all downstairs 'cause i live in an apartment building 

479.19 480.34 B: (( uh-hum [mn] )) 

479.86 481.79 A: and threw out 

482.16 487.92 A: the envelopes because i didn't want to bring anything into my apartment you know and things like that 

488.16 489.91 A: i don't do it any more 

490.96 495.16 A: and so i don't think that really there's any 

496.48 502.53 A: homeland security up to a point but i don't think up to a point that we give up some of our rights 

501.72 503.18 B: oh yeah 

503.02 503.58 A: (( [mn] )) 

503.19 517.81 B: now they are talking about monitoring people um for sickness or age what they're you know being prescribed for and their sex and if it goes like a high concentration in some areas they're gonna start checking all that stuff for 

505.92 507.02 A: mhm 

510.93 512.04 A: mhm 

517.19 518.03 A: (( uh-hum )) 

518.07 519.03 B: you know 

519.31 520.08 A: no 

519.64 524.68 B: that's going a little bit far and that's gonna be billions of dollars to monitor that 

524.72 531.79 A: well and the thing of it is already i don't know about where you're at because depending on whether it isn't uh 

532.11 535.67 A: the tennessee river authority and the dam and all down there 

534.56 537.43 B: right i was going to mention that uh we got 

537.51 539.26 B: dam like uh 

539.42 540.15 B: um 

540.33 542.42 B: i don't know ten miles from my house 

542.56 543.68 A: mhm 

543.11 546.90 B: and that's a nuclear plant [laughter] you know 

545.67 548.21 A: yeah well and we do too 

548.29 559.83 A: ohio built a nuclear plant right on the border so that if it goes it comes here [laughter] yeah and i said down thanks a lot and so we're like only thirty miles away 

553.64 554.52 B: (( yeah )) 

560.48 568.87 A: and uh it's in a different state but it's still it's close you know and i was thinking about that just in the last week or so i thought 

564.66 565.81 B: right 

569.29 572.05 A: gee i mean there's so many 

572.75 577.20 A: that i don't think it's possible we have cameras everywhere 

576.42 577.28 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

577.80 581.08 A: and uh the they put in 

582.01 589.60 A: as like somewhere like twenty three airports they put some type of security in that they didn't put in in the rest of the airports 

589.80 593.45 A: and erie was one of the airports 

593.64 596.46 A: and that's because tom ridge is from here 

597.66 599.89 A: and so he's the homeland security
