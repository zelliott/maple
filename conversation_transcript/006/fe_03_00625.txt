35.26 35.71 B: yeah 

35.85 38.53 B: uh and someone yeah that you can get along with and 

40.35 42.05 B: someone you enjoy being around 

42.34 42.90 A: mhm 

43.99 48.06 A: um not necessarily somebody that shares all your same interest 

47.04 47.92 B: right 

49.07 50.17 B: right 

49.73 51.06 A: cause i know mine doesn't

66.93 67.80 B: um 

69.58 71.40 B: well it's someone that has a lo- you know 

71.63 72.31 B: shares a 

72.65 74.49 B: you know some of your interests with you 

74.61 76.10 A: yeah some of them but not nec- 

75.23 78.10 B: that way you have some things in common to do and 

79.94 83.31 A: yeah that's true i mean it doesn't have to be all of them but yeah a few of them would be good 

82.79 83.16 B: yeah 

83.33 85.89 B: it'd be pretty bad not to have no interests (( to the other )) (( )) 

86.08 87.29 A: right right 

87.29 89.05 B: nothing to do 

88.88 89.47 A: uh-huh 

91.23 91.80 A: um 

92.40 94.14 A: i guess really just um 

94.47 97.08 A: somebody that can communicate well with you 

97.19 97.60 B: yeah 

99.19 100.41 B: yeah 

103.66 105.40 A: somebody maybe who um 

107.28 108.40 A: h- i guess i um 

108.51 112.98 A: thinking about my own husband i g- hope we're going to be married for life but um 

113.27 115.24 A: just somebody that will uh 

115.60 115.85 A: (( sense )) 

116.11 119.35 A: have a sense of what you need when you don't even really say it 

120.43 123.13 B: and comfort you when you need comforted 

123.08 123.72 A: uh-huh 

132.45 133.12 A: um 

134.07 136.01 A: yeah (( )) (( that's everything )) 

137.47 138.20 A: that i think of 

138.36 138.67 B: yeah 

138.93 139.63 A: um 

139.32 141.12 B: when we hang up we'll think of plenty more 

141.35 144.00 A: yeah that's probably true 

144.76 145.96 B: first time i did this 

146.15 147.35 A: me too me too 

146.86 148.57 B: really well that's good 

147.45 148.02 A: uh-huh 

151.72 152.01 A: but 

154.42 158.61 A: yeah well i think you just it's going to come on and tell you when it when you're done 

158.65 160.32 B: oh so you just keep talking until 

160.50 161.69 A: i think so yeah 

161.43 162.86 B: keep thinking of things 

162.77 163.35 A: right 

163.92 167.11 A: yeah that was my understanding it was going to let uh notify you when 

166.72 168.49 B: we could go on and on and on 

168.49 174.60 A: right um i think i uh uh i i've been married twel- almost twelve years and i think that um 

175.39 179.92 A: (( )) if i had to do it all again i'd definitely would look for different things 

180.28 182.83 A: not necessarily that i picked the wrong things i just 

182.97 183.42 A: have a 

183.57 186.15 A: better guess now that i'm more mature have a better 

186.76 187.34 B: right 

187.82 188.11 A: of 

188.25 189.11 A: idea about 

189.60 189.92 A: things 

190.22 192.46 A: that i think are important i mean i got lucky and i 

192.87 195.02 A: got some of the things that i think are important but 

196.52 197.85 A: i'd be a lot more cautious 

198.36 198.95 B: right 

199.38 199.86 B: right 

200.10 204.89 A: screening process i guess (( or not )) just a little bit more you know mind set of what was 

205.33 209.53 A: down the road once you became old enough and responsible and all that 

210.43 211.09 B: right 

211.31 212.69 B: it's just hard to find someone that 

213.28 213.91 B: (( compatible )) 

215.24 217.42 B: that you know you can be friends with and 

219.11 219.61 A: mhm 

221.09 221.76 A: right that's 

222.04 223.15 A: definitely true 

223.34 224.88 A: and then some days you still want to kill them 

225.56 225.83 B: yeah 

228.07 228.55 A: i'll say 

228.21 228.52 B: (( so )) 

228.74 230.95 B: i guess everyone has their arguments though 

231.49 233.07 B: even if you've met someone that 

234.96 235.80 B: exactly alike 

236.05 236.38 B: still 

238.18 239.15 A: right i'm (( )) 

238.88 239.30 B: oh (( )) 

239.72 240.97 A: right yeah yeah 

241.42 243.33 A: it w- it wouldn't be very challenging then 

243.56 244.02 B: no 

245.12 248.64 A: also i think too it's helpful if um you have family 

249.10 249.75 A: support 

249.91 251.94 A: uh as far as 

252.42 254.15 A: that they like your your 

254.43 255.49 A: partner too 

255.22 256.74 B: yeah that makes a big deal 

258.53 260.56 B: they hated him it would make your life miserable 

260.84 261.56 A: mhm 

262.50 266.59 A: yeah i yeah if they're not really in favor it makes it a whole lot harder i think 

267.64 272.10 A: oh man i know that too for a fact that it you know just makes it harder but um 

272.81 273.14 A: they 

273.21 274.82 A: kind of ha- i mean of course it's your de- uh 

275.01 275.91 A: decision but 

276.43 280.00 A: if they have a you know (( )) a whole lot longer 

279.65 280.33 B: right 

282.23 283.22 B: they can make it rough 

283.43 284.19 A: uh-huh 

284.83 285.80 A: definitely 

289.61 292.43 A: and i well i had a i had somebody maybe you know like 

292.56 294.92 A: (( say somebody that could )) work but yeah somebody that 

295.16 296.44 A: you know is able to 

297.03 298.11 A: um provide 

298.46 298.91 B: yeah 

300.87 303.53 A: some kind of rich relative or work or whatever 

303.51 306.34 B: yeah that would work either way 

307.78 308.07 B: but 

308.18 310.01 B: this day and time it's hard to find 

312.83 313.11 A: uh 

314.40 314.97 A: yeah 

315.78 316.34 A: yeah 

316.83 318.34 B: don't want everything handed to them 

318.60 320.44 A: right that's true too 

321.05 323.16 A: or expect you're going to start off and be 

324.02 324.61 A: you know get 

324.79 325.86 A: a million dollars 

326.99 328.90 A: yeah i think yeah that's (( probably )) it 

329.01 329.87 A: too and it's li- 

329.47 331.11 B: the h- do the housework 

331.39 333.21 B: cook the supper 

331.58 332.93 A: oh definitely 

334.19 334.89 B: that would help 

334.33 337.12 A: yeah h- help out with the family chores and 

336.91 337.32 B: yeah 

338.00 338.89 A: the errands 

340.39 341.41 A: and the um 

342.65 343.27 A: all the little 

343.62 345.32 A: yucky work too 

345.62 348.07 B: yeah that's also left up for the women to do 

348.23 348.89 A: mhm 

349.91 352.75 A: yes i think it would be awesome for any any uh 

353.30 353.70 A: (( to life )) 

353.80 358.64 A: partner that would be willing to do windows and vacuum and all that good 

358.14 358.65 B: yeah 

358.78 359.28 A: stuff 

359.07 359.43 B: yeah 

361.00 362.02 B: that would be great 

364.71 365.14 B: (( occasion )) 

372.66 373.23 A: uh-huh 

373.78 377.72 A: although love enters into sometimes or what you think is love 

382.40 382.91 A: mhm 

385.76 388.59 A: right the first time that they don't want to be helpful 

393.84 397.94 A: at least somebody also too someone that um shares your um same faith 

398.09 398.92 A: is helpful 

399.30 399.73 B: yeah 

407.12 407.73 A: mhm 

409.18 412.67 A: yeah i know but i'm living in the south the big bible belt that's a big 

412.86 414.05 A: to do down here so 

414.73 415.27 A: um 

416.73 417.82 A: just you know that 

418.82 424.37 A: you know that people that families go to church together and it would be hard if your partner did not 

424.94 425.58 A: you know 

426.54 427.46 A: do that or 

428.44 433.62 A: believe what you believed or even have an open mind to what you believed they didn't believe the same 

434.35 435.40 A: that would be harder 

436.26 437.59 A: especially if there's children 

439.98 441.99 B: yeah i can imagine it probably would be 

445.51 446.97 A: hm too that um 

448.76 449.55 A: that uh 

449.81 453.23 A: a partner that would be somebody who could um 

455.51 456.17 A: pick up 

456.63 457.95 A: where you left off 

458.74 461.68 A: um just in everyday little things kind of 

462.11 465.46 A: you know like really truly be your right hand 

465.95 466.43 B: right 

467.64 467.99 B: right 

468.68 470.20 B: you know if you weren't home 

470.89 474.01 B: and you know they got here before got home before you did and 

474.14 476.93 B: knowing supper had to be cooked they'd go ahead and get is started 

477.56 478.06 B: you know 

478.32 478.85 A: mhm 

478.83 481.38 B: and didn't just sit and wait oh where's my supper 

481.63 482.28 A: uh-huh 

482.87 483.86 B: that would be good 

484.00 488.67 A: and if there were psychic and a mind reader that'd probably be good too but that'd be a little too much to ask for 

489.38 491.55 B: stop by the grocery store on the way home 

493.21 494.88 B: which sean does that quite often 

497.19 498.89 A: mhm hey that's a good one 

501.81 502.29 B: groceries 

503.57 506.14 A: mine does that occasionally it's usually on the days that i'll 

506.26 506.52 A: (( elect )) 

506.66 508.81 A: to do the same on the way home from work we just 

509.31 512.95 A: meet up we both have done it 

512.97 513.85 B: oh no 

513.29 513.82 A: you know and 

514.01 517.83 A: and picked up like you know just really a quick trip in for some essentials 

516.56 517.29 B: yeah 

517.65 518.95 B: yeah just the basics 

518.57 520.22 A: double bread double milk 

520.15 520.48 B: yeah 

520.91 521.93 B: that happens a lot 

523.34 525.08 A: but it i always appreciated that
