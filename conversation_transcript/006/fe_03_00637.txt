92.34 95.19 B: for continental and they um 

93.43 94.33 A: uh-huh 

95.72 106.44 B: cut back so drastically that i ended up leaving because after being there for four years i went back on reserve because they cut back everybody 

105.94 106.86 A: uh-huh 

106.50 115.68 B: and reserve what reserve is is when you first get started you're on call twenty four hours a day and they can give you two hours notice to go like on a quick trip somewhere 

111.48 112.75 A: (( oh yeah )) 

115.43 117.83 A: and was this when you had your little two year old 

117.85 119.01 A: your baby 

118.04 121.68 B: i was coming right off of my maternity leave and going back to work 

120.50 122.86 A: oh you wouldn't want to do that

123.07 123.96 A: uh-huh 

127.17 135.02 A: well i think that's fr- i mean you know chances are like they say of anything happening but i don't know with the baby i'd wanna be home with her 

129.46 131.14 B: yeah 

134.69 145.32 B: yeah well you know it wasn't even it wasn't even like a fear of something happening it was just my work was no longer the same because they cut back hours and i couldn't get the same 

138.71 139.68 A: mhm 

145.68 154.70 B: you know kind of trips i wanted i like as a line holder you get a month's schedule and it's just your schedule but as a reserve person you're just whatever they want you to do 

151.40 152.33 A: (( mhm )) 

155.09 161.87 B: so they've actually offered so many leaves because they're trying to get rid of people there like i have friends who are 

161.80 174.11 B: who have on leave pretty much since it happened and they just keep offering more i think hoping hoping people won't come back 'cause they just don't have as many flights and as much money as they're not growing like they were before 

164.03 165.39 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

173.76 178.24 A: well that had to be awful wh- where were you when that happened september eleven

272.61 277.02 B: not sure i know if you go to canada i think there's a big 

277.70 278.99 B: place 

278.36 286.78 A: uh-huh so okay let's get back to the subject [laughter] so is there anywhere around you that would be like a big mall or anything like that that you would 

280.35 282.41 B: [laughter] 

285.34 291.43 B: okay yeah well we have um a like south park center is probably our largest nicest mall 

291.05 291.94 A: uh-huh 

291.44 301.74 B: but it doesn't you know i really don't think about it it doesn't really i i guess i just figure it's just gonna meant to happen to me no matter what i change or do it's in my fate you know what i mean 

295.08 296.06 A: well 

297.31 298.29 A: right 

300.52 314.67 A: yeah well my daughter's thirty two and the kids are eight and ten so lots of times i stay home and then you hear you hear warnings kinda like oh something's buzzing that maybe something will happen at disneyland or something 

302.26 303.72 B: [noise] 

313.81 317.71 B: yeah well you have a huge theme park there

323.64 326.17 B: six flags uh-huh we have one of those too 

324.59 329.40 A: and knots berry farm so any time they go to those places i'm really kinda 

329.16 330.41 B: yeah 

329.94 343.01 A: and now this weekend she's talking about um my two daughters and the two kids going to las vegas and just to look around and they have the kids you know so they're not going to gamble but there's supposed to be a lot of things families can do 

335.67 336.62 B: mhm 

340.05 341.19 B: right 

343.08 344.03 A: and 

343.18 346.54 B: you know what i used to have layovers there it is it's a lot of fun 

345.29 354.91 A: oh uh-huh well i'm telling the kids boy there's gonna be crowds you better the little ten year old boy he just drifts off and he goes and sees whatever he wants you know 

354.42 355.69 B: yeah 

354.82 363.24 A: i said somebody can get you in a minute i said they you know they have people that block views and you know just stand in front of somebody and [mn] 

356.43 357.74 B: [laughter] 

360.23 361.58 B: yeah 

361.88 371.03 B: yeah and you know i'm more worried about that than anything because there was a um something around here that somebody a neighbor or something had gone into 

371.16 375.66 B: someone's house while the parents were sleeping broken in and stole their child 

374.98 377.00 A: oh that yeah that's happened here 

376.51 380.82 B: i'm like more afraid of that [mn] than someone attacking 

378.37 380.87 A: yeah well lock your doors and 

381.29 386.78 A: huh yeah you don't want to you know leave her out of your sights oh i love girls i have two girls 

387.36 391.44 A: well that's after i had one that's all i wanted was more girls 

390.07 394.50 B: [laughter] yeah yeah 

392.32 393.96 A: so uh 

394.11 399.35 A: other than that you know i mean i've seen a lot of people on t._v. you know on oprah and all them how 

399.00 400.22 B: mhm 

399.41 406.89 A: they've really you know said how this has really affected their lives and they've they second thoughts but i don't have a hus- 

403.25 404.97 B: yeah 

405.83 410.55 B: i think it's it's affected a lot of um people's jobs 

410.51 411.52 A: (( uh-huh )) 

410.79 411.99 B: you know 

411.92 425.93 B: a lot of like just for an example the rock hall of fame my friends lost jobs there because the uh they were getting funding actually funding from continental and continental cut back all their funding after september eleventh because they were losing money 

425.53 426.47 A: uh-huh 

425.98 432.71 B: and so then that in turn that was their biggest funder for the rock hall so that in turn meant that um 

432.82 434.45 B: they were you know 

434.41 436.54 A: when you say rock hall what do you mean 

436.55 439.67 B: we have the rock hall of fame in cleveland 

439.13 441.50 A: rocks or rock and roll or what [laughter] 

440.59 442.67 B: rock and roll hall of fame 

441.71 444.99 A: [laughter] okay rock and roll i understand that 

444.27 445.85 B: (( [laughter] yeah sorry )) 

445.17 446.81 A: [laughter] 

445.94 453.47 B: yeah we have the rock and roll hall of fame here and so because they lost so much funding because september eleventh affected the airlines 

452.79 453.71 A: uh-huh 

453.48 464.43 B: and that was who that's who funded them then my friends have lost their jobs so they were out of work for like six months she finally found a job um with the red cross because she didn't like non profit organisation kind of thing 

464.04 464.89 A: uh-huh 

464.48 467.68 B: and the rock hall is non profit but yeah 

465.75 470.24 A: oh see you're interesting you know a lot they'll get a lot of information out of you 

469.62 471.60 B: [laughter] 

470.46 479.44 A: yeah i'm i'll just stay at home and you know help with the kids and take 'em to school and back and forth but you are involved in how this has affected other people
