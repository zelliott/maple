22.72 24.04 B: little bit i 

28.60 29.46 A: um 

28.70 31.86 B: don't know whether we're waiting for another prompt or 

31.97 32.73 A: (( uh )) 

32.46 34.61 B: they said introduce yourself 

34.17 44.87 A: right um the calls that i've been on before i didn't get another prompt until close to the end of the conversation they'll let us know there's just a short time left 

44.41 45.70 B: (( oh really )) 

45.37 46.20 A: yeah 

46.07 47.33 B: oh okay 

46.59 51.67 A: and then a couple of the others that i have been on there was nothing at the end we just 

51.76 55.95 A: uh talked maybe fifteen minutes or so and then hung up so [laughter] 

55.27 58.26 B: mhm so it's not very structured then 

57.85 59.05 A: right 

60.51 69.68 B: uh i had uh i was on vacation last week so um i think i got one voicemail and of course i couldn't take so this is my first one 

69.39 70.48 A: right 

70.06 71.33 B: um 

72.92 76.91 B: so i guess we should discuss it then huh 

76.31 77.78 A: (( right [mn] )) 

77.53 80.03 B: how did it affect you at all 

79.64 81.50 A: oh [mn] well 

82.26 88.59 A: things that i have done different since that time um tending to spend a whole lot more time with my family 

88.63 89.80 B: mhm 

89.19 94.42 A: i was uh working a lot my husband was working a lot of overtime and everything at the time and 

94.74 97.31 A: and uh [mn] our kids were 

97.74 104.88 A: at the point where they wanted to stay in their room and read or listen to their music or whatever since that time we have um 

105.77 109.90 A: had our satellite service disconnected where 

110.08 113.99 A: we had nothing to do but spend time with each other when we're home together 

114.45 119.75 A: so it has made a big difference as far as the closeness in our family 

119.98 120.86 A: um 

121.52 123.32 B: that's probably a good thing 

122.71 125.73 A: it seems it seems like you know 

125.79 128.85 A: i mean i'm not scared of 

129.11 132.53 A: what might happen you know i'm not living in fear 

133.00 141.57 A: because i know that if god were to decide you know within the next fifteen minutes it's my time to go i'm ready 

141.58 142.84 B: mhm 

142.24 143.16 A: so

146.49 150.73 A: no no i'm not afraid of anything happening to me um 

151.75 153.45 A: as far as that goes 

154.36 155.12 A: oh 

155.17 163.85 A: i mean nobody likes to think about you know walking into an airport and getting on a plane and it being the last time you ever do you know [laughter] but uh 

161.51 163.19 B: right yeah 

164.78 168.71 A: but as far as living in fear it hasn't affected me that way 

169.58 173.09 A: if anything i would say it has uh 

170.00 170.77 B: yeah 

175.03 178.31 A: just pulled everybody in our family closer 

179.03 180.75 B: yeah

193.82 194.92 A: yeah

214.59 217.81 B: i may be a little hardened or uh 

217.83 229.88 B: you know going through life i mean i've been on ships i've been on airplanes you know spent my nine months in vietnam my brother uh was there with me he he died of uh 

222.29 223.84 A: yeah 

225.12 226.43 A: right 

229.85 244.09 B: you know had problems uh from vietnam from post traumatic stress disorder i came from a military family we're pretty close uh sort of a loner though my wife's from another country so we have different uh i guess

237.68 239.47 A: yeah 

241.29 242.29 A: yeah 

244.36 245.50 B: um 

245.75 248.33 B: different interests um 

247.13 248.33 A: yeah 

249.37 262.25 B: and so like i said i felt sorry for the people who died but uh i read a lot on ashcroft before he became attorney general and it's like this is so strange that all these 

252.81 253.83 A: yeah 

257.67 258.95 A: right 

261.77 262.98 A: mhm 

262.44 271.18 B: things sort of fit in you know not that i really believe the government would have something to do with it but i've seen everything heard everything 

265.90 267.21 A: yeah 

268.37 270.05 A: yeah 

270.75 272.45 A: oh yeah 

271.22 273.53 B: nothing really surprises me 

273.19 283.14 A: yeah i've done a lot of research since that time and i guess i've probably read more history since that time than i have in my entire life 

279.62 280.61 B: really 

283.45 284.89 A: you know [laughter] mhm 

284.08 290.92 B: yeah yeah it's interesting because you just start thinking and well let me see why you know 

288.62 289.86 A: yeah were there 

290.01 292.97 A: yeah and were there signs leading up to this or 

293.05 294.34 A: (( you know [laughter] )) 

293.91 295.40 B: (( yeah )) 

295.55 296.89 B: um 

297.23 297.80 B: (( [mn] )) 

298.00 312.93 B: see i was at work when it happened and a lot of people stayed home were afraid i took one plane ride last thanksgiving not two thousand and two but two thousand and one to visit my mother in atlanta and 

301.85 303.21 A: yeah 

312.24 313.05 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

313.02 314.80 B: it definitely 

314.85 322.67 B: not that i travel all that much but there's such a lot of people in the airport it was sort of inconvenient you know an inconvenience 

316.58 317.86 A: (( mhm )) 

319.67 321.10 A: yeah 

323.03 327.02 B: i guess that's probably the greatest impact it had on me 

323.06 324.18 A: (( mhm )) 

325.80 326.89 A: yeah 

327.21 328.47 B: um 

328.76 329.38 B: (( [mn] )) 

330.67 332.42 B: what else 

332.75 333.62 A: um 

335.46 345.31 A: well i was trying to think the day that it happened i had just left my girls at school and i came home and i turned my computer on and before i got signed on good um 

345.46 351.87 A: a friend of mine instant messaged me and asked me had i heard any news and i said no and he said well you need to turn your t._v. now 

351.90 353.14 B: yeah 

352.97 354.07 A: and uh 

354.34 356.61 A: i turned my t._v. on 

357.11 361.63 A: uh i'm gonna say maybe five minutes before the second plane hit 

361.70 365.59 A: and then i guess probably for the next thirty six hours that's where i was i 

365.87 366.76 B: yeah 

366.01 367.09 A: was um 

367.47 369.26 A: right in front of the t._v. i 

369.53 372.36 A: i sat there and cried and um 

372.82 377.31 A: prayed for the people that their families were involved and oh 

375.26 375.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

380.16 382.37 A: i don't know just 

383.03 386.53 B: you're you're a housewife you take care of the kids 

384.84 386.10 A: mhm 

386.29 392.75 A: yeah and a substitute teacher so um i'm here part time part time not [laughter] 

388.30 389.43 B: (( oh okay )) 

392.04 393.76 B: yeah 

393.05 397.66 A: so i do substitute teaching [mn] and so it's um 

399.36 400.22 A: (( it's )) 

401.09 407.90 B: i i guess another [mn] input not direct- well i guess it's directly related uh 

403.39 404.82 A: mhm 

407.84 420.33 B: that it seems to me you know i i like i said i came from the military from my thing was in the seventies so the way to do things is different so i'm old fashioned and live in live in the seventies but 

420.34 434.28 B: the way that they're [laughter] going about you know with tons and tons of ammunition and war planes and over there trying to kill one or two afghanistan guys and they've had more accidents killing americans than they've had 

430.11 431.31 A: right 

433.85 434.86 A: yeah 

434.16 437.80 B: casualties you know and it's like it's like uh 

438.26 452.80 B: it reminds me of the mindset that i read in the sixties uh or when they started the vietnam war and everybody believed whatever kennedy said whatever he he he wanted it this way and that's the way they were gonna do it and then it was like 

448.10 449.98 A: (( i know yeah [laughter] )) 

452.82 456.50 B: ten years later it's like like you know what we're 

456.52 465.03 B: we're not doing anything and we got a lot of people there and fifty eight thousand guys are dead so let's uh let's back out while we're 

462.38 463.31 A: (( mhm )) 

465.09 470.44 B: ahead you know so it's like uh americans get in this mindset and they just 

465.63 467.47 A: yeah 

470.75 472.56 B: you know uh 

473.16 477.24 B: i don't know the word for it uh we all believe in 

477.30 481.01 B: in the same thing you know uh sort of get 

479.33 480.90 A: yeah 

481.11 485.17 B: uh like sheep you know got down the trail and uh 

485.51 496.16 B: get brainwashed a little not that there's a lot of people that have their own disagreements oh yeah americans you know are independent too but it's i just see this you know 

486.75 487.78 A: [laughter] 

496.32 500.44 B: uh sort of strange thing i sort of sit back and watch the 

500.46 502.48 B: way people react 

501.90 503.15 A: yeah 

507.04 509.78 B: um so anyway that's uh 

511.30 517.77 B: september eleventh i had a friend that i just contacted recently that i went to high school and college with and 

517.10 519.01 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

517.56 531.08 B: we had a reunion and i contacted him i think a couple of months before that happened and his daughter went to the elementary school closest to the pentagon i guess he was the first one there 

528.92 530.16 A: mhm 

531.24 532.97 A: yeah 

531.26 538.62 B: to pick up his daughter so he was right there i called him because i knew he was in alexandria and i knew that was close 

536.50 537.70 A: yeah 

538.82 544.93 B: and his wife's a c._i._a. agent uh so he doesn't anything what she does but 

542.14 543.34 A: yeah 

545.12 545.95 B: uh 

545.49 547.20 A: (( yeah ))

549.80 551.62 B: person that i 

551.77 556.13 B: had any direct contact with that was close by there i guess

556.93 558.43 A: (( yeah well i had )) 

558.53 561.43 A: i can't think of anybody you know that 

561.60 562.83 A: was um 

563.11 567.44 A: directly related with us that was involved in that now recently 

567.69 570.78 A: just within the last couple of weeks i have uh 

570.82 574.20 A: started talking to this lady on a message board 

574.22 575.50 A: (( that um )) 

575.54 581.89 A: is dealing with a lot of things from it because her husband was killed there 

581.99 583.12 B: (( [mn] oh )) 

583.37 590.17 A: and so you know she's really going through a lot and we've kind of got a little on line support group for her so [laughter] 

589.89 592.40 B: [noise] that's good was he in the building or something 

591.90 593.57 A: yes he was in the building
