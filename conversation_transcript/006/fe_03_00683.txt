13.16 21.04 B: yeah i'm i'm not too sure about the um new measures i just traveled a week or so ago and i didn't really notice any difference 

18.79 19.34 A: mhm 

21.19 23.60 A: in oh in the security themselves itself 

23.08 26.51 B: in the security itself except for uh waiting longer but i don't 

27.14 31.52 B: feel like they checked anything more closely or anything like that 

29.44 30.03 A: right 

36.80 37.22 B: mhm 

37.77 44.31 A: every single way every every single stop along the way they are always checking my shoes which i mean i think is good because 

44.49 49.70 A: i mean they have had problems with that and i just know uh coming out of uh la guardia there was just an 

49.01 49.39 B: mhm 

49.90 56.06 A: amazing wait um which wasn't good but um there was just lines so i mean i've i've seen more 

56.19 57.39 A: but um 

56.23 56.76 B: yeah 

57.61 59.23 B: you think it is any more effective 

57.74 58.12 A: actually 

59.94 61.26 A: ach i i 

75.10 76.06 A: i don't know i mean 

76.14 79.64 A: to the i i have a feeling that it is more effective to the point of view that it is like 

85.92 86.77 B: mh- 

87.12 91.96 B: maybe i don't know they didn't check my shoes they didn't do anything um 

92.52 94.13 B: my laptop they just had me 

94.33 94.76 B: pass it 

95.33 100.66 B: through to them they didn't even x. ray it it didn't go through the metal detector they just like passed it over the 

95.98 96.26 A: oh 

100.56 101.48 A: oh that is interesting 

101.18 106.12 B: little thing and they didn't have me turn it on or anything like that so i thought that was interesting 

104.20 104.57 A: mhm 

105.46 107.93 A: hm was was this uh an international flight or domestic 

107.70 113.93 B: no this was a domestic flight i was flying from uh san jose california when i was flying home to philadelphia 

112.33 112.63 A: oh 

113.97 114.71 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

114.90 115.50 B: um 

116.83 118.27 B: it it yeah i don't 

118.48 121.77 A: perhaps it is more i mean perhaps it is more astringent on the international 

121.92 122.66 A: um 

122.35 123.49 B: did you notice a difference 

123.82 126.76 B: going leaving the u._s. as opposed to entering the u._s. 

126.38 127.46 A: well see actually i left 

127.63 130.65 A: two weeks after september eleventh so at that point 

130.94 132.82 A: i actually a- a- after that point 

132.98 143.09 A: it wasn't actually as much as i thought it would have been i thought that it would have been you know just delays upon delays and you know absolute everything you know um but it really wasn't um i mean it was more actually in some ways 

137.81 138.28 B: mhm 

144.51 147.08 A: on more on my later travels i experienced more 

147.50 147.80 B: hm 

149.39 153.19 B: they always pass me right by but i always wonder if it is you know 

153.56 158.38 B: -cause i'm a woman because i am white and all these things i don't know i mean if i were 

154.53 155.31 A: right 

156.74 157.39 A: yeah 

158.91 160.33 B: you know uh um 

160.49 163.32 B: dark skinned male if it would be different 

163.15 164.54 A: right right right right right 

164.65 166.08 B: i don't know 

165.24 171.45 A: i mean i know a certain flight me flying i mean i'm a male flying you know i'm young flying by myself a lot of the times can you know i'm sure that is just like 

179.85 183.28 A: so frustrating because i don't want to get on the plane you know and you are just like 

182.36 182.67 B: hm 

184.10 184.40 A: but 

184.67 185.38 A: i mean i guess 

185.71 188.85 A: c- i mean i don't know i can't see how this wouldn't be more helpful 

189.28 191.28 A: in catching things 

190.43 196.45 B: well i don't know see i get a little bit scared i have a friend of mine who um traveled and unwittingly 

197.14 198.22 B: took with her 

198.38 199.77 B: a pair of sewing scissors 

199.85 200.71 A: oh yeah mhm 

200.05 210.54 B: that were huge and she managed to get them on the plane and when she got home she was unpacking her carry-on bag and found -em and she she freaked out she was like how did they let me on there with it 

202.96 203.48 A: really 

209.92 211.27 A: oh wow yeah 

210.99 212.10 B: you know big scissors 

212.32 217.85 A: was she actually uh d- it was kind of funny like (( )) my um my parents were leaving were flying um 

218.21 226.39 A: i think within the country and they um my dad had um nail clippers and they had a file on it and they broke it off and 

224.90 229.02 B: really i left mine at home just in case 

227.89 237.29 A: yeah i mean exactly and he actually and he had scissors too and he told me about this later i'm like why did you take scissors but he you know and they confiscated it and i think he could probably get it later on the way back but 

237.09 239.85 B: well my friend didn't mean to take -em with her it was it was just 

239.05 239.48 A: right 

240.18 244.61 B: happened to be there and she didn't discover it until she got home but somehow she got through 

245.74 248.95 B: you know security i think she went through um 

246.63 247.19 A: yeah 

249.79 251.01 B: she was going to d._c. 

251.24 251.72 A: mhm 

251.79 252.41 B: um 

252.61 254.11 B: from d._c. to california 

254.22 254.97 A: mhm mhm 

255.05 255.75 B: um 

256.21 262.43 B: she had these i mean they are big scissors they could seriously damage somebody i mean these are the heavy duty sewing scissors 

261.67 263.08 A: and you say that they'd be big enough that they 

263.23 264.94 A: could see very easily 

264.43 266.94 B: yeah they are you know they are probably at least 

267.58 272.63 B: six inches long or something like that and you know they are not wimpy little scissors or the kind that 

269.01 270.23 A: right right right 

272.85 275.68 B: you would attach to your keys or something like that they are big 

274.65 277.05 A: so do you think you'd do you think you would be more let's say 

277.55 278.76 A: um sort of s- 

279.11 280.88 A: confidant about everything if it was more 

281.03 288.45 A: um consistent you know like if if my parents weren't stopped and then i mean were stopped but your friend wasn't you know and sort of like but if everybody was 

282.33 283.68 B: -cause i'm like yeah 

287.82 291.77 B: if everybody was i would feel a little better about it and i think if we 

289.73 290.70 A: yeah yeah 

291.99 297.41 B: um the u._s. worked more closely with airport security in other countries as well 

297.38 298.76 A: mh- mhm mhm 

298.34 304.23 B: to learn a little more i i think the security is more intense in the other countries at least that i visited 

303.15 303.52 A: mhm 

304.33 304.81 A: mh- 

305.13 315.46 B: um kind of l- learning from that and and keeping databases or something you know some communication or or something i would feel a little bit more positive about it 

312.13 314.16 A: yeah yeah i'm sure yeah 

315.11 321.15 A: actually it was i've so i over when i was in europe i i went to france over winter break and 

320.34 320.75 B: mhm 

321.40 327.44 A: i think i just had the worst time i think the shoe bomber was like two months earlier or something like that and 

326.66 329.66 B: that is okay i was supposed to fly on september thirteenth 

329.93 331.17 A: oh wow 

330.98 338.26 B: of last year i was interviewing at various schools on the east coast and so i was supposed to fly into um 

335.42 336.18 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

338.53 339.51 B: dulles airport 

339.74 340.39 A: okay sure 

340.17 349.26 B: in in washington and i was supposed to interview at all these schools during the fourteenth fifteenth and whenever and of course my flight was canceled because the airport was closed for a long time and 

341.94 342.49 A: mhm 

348.45 350.01 A: right for the whole week i believe 

349.81 355.16 B: oh i think it was a little bit longer than that but not much maybe a week a week and a half or something like that and so 

352.03 352.77 A: was it yeah 

354.20 354.54 A: yeah 

355.53 360.54 B: that made me nervous like ew if i had left two days earlier who knows you know 

360.10 362.38 A: there was like a couple of days afterwards my mom called me up and she was like 

362.63 374.07 A: you have a flight on american airlines we need to talk and i was just you know but i mean so coming out of france it was like i forget what i i can't remember but it was something like i was like this is it 

365.96 367.61 B: yeah 

368.18 368.54 B: but 

382.90 390.87 A: that you know was like i mean and heathrow i think probably i had the best um checking through i mean it was the most annoying but i mean it was the most thorough and so she was keeping people separate 

382.95 383.75 B: yeah 

390.95 391.40 A: from 

391.58 393.43 A: stuff like that and but like i was just 

391.80 392.20 B: mhm 

393.64 398.68 A: sort of like i was hello you just had this guy leaving from france you know why wasn't there more 

398.39 404.25 B: exactly plus i i also wonder too with making the airport security people um 

404.58 408.93 B: the requirement of being u._s. citizens or permanent residents or whatever it is um 

406.73 407.36 A: hm 

409.12 413.22 B: you know i'm worried about a disgruntled employee or you know that is kind of 

411.37 411.97 A: yeah 

412.08 413.10 A: yeah yeah 

413.48 417.27 B: things as well why they sort out their own internal organization 

417.46 422.75 A: it's it is kind of i mean in some ways you know you always have the thing like who inspects the inspectors 

422.47 423.95 B: yeah exactly 

422.89 427.07 A: i mean you are right i mean like what happens if someone just decides to you know stop being 

427.59 429.60 A: uh cooperative i guess yeah 

429.14 435.02 B: or whatever or having standards like you said i mean if everyone is taking the law into their own hands or whatever 

435.29 436.59 B: i don't know i mean 

436.80 443.55 B: that's got to be a sucky job just sitting there looking at the little x. ray machine or dragging the little dog along the suitcases 

440.32 441.57 A: yeah and 

442.47 445.51 A: it is so boring but it is like so important like at the same time so 

444.52 447.42 B: it is so important too so uh you know what 

446.41 448.06 A: what do you do 

447.76 452.55 B: what are they doing you know to kind of improve that to keep them more on alert you look at twenty three 

450.52 450.91 A: yeah 

452.76 454.35 B: thousand suitcases 

454.60 459.15 B: you are going to miss something you know is there something else they can do from the employees 

455.64 456.19 A: right 

456.32 457.26 A: right right oh definitely 

459.40 459.91 B: aspects 

460.45 467.36 A: yeah well i well yeah well i don't see why they also just started that thing where they i mean i haven't fl- i haven't traveled since i came back in 

467.52 472.81 A: june but they have um i guess they are doing that thing now where they open up they will be more willing to open up your bags 

472.79 474.04 B: and they x. ray them all 

474.01 475.23 A: and they x. uh yeah 

475.38 475.67 A: yeah 

475.38 478.94 B: -cause they kept asking me do you have a camera do you have film in your bag da da da 

479.62 482.50 B: i don't know if they really x. rayed them 

481.74 486.81 A: i i think the biggest problem in the airline industry is just their service but that is just another story 

485.76 490.92 B: well they are all going bankrupt now too so where do uh where do the airlines get the funds 

488.29 488.99 A: yeah 

492.06 495.04 B: increase security you know which means more personnel 

492.07 492.58 A: yeah 

493.31 494.00 A: well that is the thing 

494.65 496.52 A: that actually that is the thing now is that they federalized 

497.21 498.40 A: it is under federal control now 

497.91 499.20 B: yeah that is true 

498.54 506.48 A: so i mean so at least now you know we we don't have to worry about well you know we can only have three people on instead of five or something like that 

505.96 510.64 B: that is true but i worry about the airline industry too i don't know what about the 

509.04 509.48 A: oh yeah 

509.68 510.36 A: yeah i've 

510.83 516.65 B: pilots carrying guns that is a whole other topic and you know and uh you know there are a lot of 

513.44 514.71 A: yeah
