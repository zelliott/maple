20.27 21.15 B: okay 

26.52 32.06 B: yeah i think that and just at the beginning they said just to discuss september eleventh even so 

32.43 41.70 B: i guess the biggest changes for us would just be appreciating what we have and and paying more attention to what's going on around us 

42.31 44.17 A: yeah i'll agree with that 

42.81 43.53 B: that's

62.41 63.39 B: mhm 

64.14 64.93 B: (( okay )) 

71.45 82.16 A: [mn] i i'm a little bit more aware of what you know how other countries perceive us i guess that the the negative way that they perceive us you know us as in being americans 

79.53 80.57 B: oh 

82.24 91.66 A: um but yeah i i i agree with what you said i mean i definitely do appreciate what i do have um when i see what you know obviously a lot of people don't 

91.01 99.08 B: yeah and i have to totally agree with you too on the aspect of seeing how other countries perceive us i had no idea how bad it was [laughter] 

99.24 99.96 A: (( no )) 

100.00 111.04 A: nor did i but i mean you know uh a lot of people say that i mean we only get what we get from the news you know so i mean we're pretty you know sheltered i would thing unless we travel 

111.15 112.72 B: i think so 

113.02 118.76 B: i was just reading somewhere i can't even remember if it was what country it was but they were talking about 

118.97 123.85 B: that couples didn't even dare go to the bars at night and this is supposed to be 

124.08 130.33 B: you know fairly friendly country because if you're just a couple alone you'll get beat up 

130.65 131.75 B: you know 

132.21 134.15 B: it's like it's sad uh-huh 

134.06 142.74 A: [noise] yeah it is um i mean a a lot of the other things that you know i mean i've learned a lot more about other cultures and things 

142.78 146.61 A: um in general you know from what's gone on um 

146.60 152.12 A: you know i i've always i work in technology so i'm exposed to a lot of you know [mn] 

152.05 156.78 A: people that are not from you know the u._s. or or here on a visa but 

156.65 168.37 A: i i never really realized you know how they lived or what they thought or you know um how fanatic [laughter] they could be about the religion some of them 

168.83 173.27 A: you know and and we have that here too so i won't sit here and say that we don't but 

172.74 173.69 B: right 

173.40 182.52 A: it was it was a big eye opener um but uh were you uh did you fly at all like have you i mean did you fly a lot before 

180.67 181.70 B: (( actually )) 

182.14 185.33 B: actually no i have never been in a big plane so 

185.02 188.13 A: oh okay [laughter] 

185.81 187.02 B: [laughter] 

187.34 191.19 B: i'm in rural michigan [laughter] how about you 

189.78 190.74 A: well 

191.10 203.29 A: i um i don't fly a lot but i fly like about two or three times a year and and i will say that um what's kinda ironic is is that i was at a high school reunion the week before september eleventh where i had to fly 

203.44 213.24 A: um so i was kinda thinking man i'm you know what if i had been on a plane then because i really was i was traveling from pennsylvania to georgia 

213.17 214.34 B: oh 

213.54 226.52 A: exactly the week before [laughter] um but uh i remember the first flight i took after september eleventh which was a while i think it was in february um of last year i was definitely very nervous 

226.56 227.37 B: oh 

227.12 236.47 A: you know not so much as something was going to go wrong but i was really nervous because of how different it was to fly i mean you were really searched and there were you know 

236.25 247.98 A: military people and stuff in the airports with guns and you know just things that i had never seen before you know it was definitely very different but uh once the plane took off i felt fine [laughter] 

247.33 250.40 B: oh well i can just imagine the the stress 

250.69 251.98 A: [laughter] 

250.97 259.74 B: you know why you're there like you say with the guns and wondering you know not necessarily that there is gonna be a terrorist attack but what if somebody did some stupid [laughter] 

259.90 261.24 A: [laughter] yeah i do 

260.18 261.22 B: you know 

261.80 270.36 A: well they definitely searched you know i was surprised at like the things that they would take from your bags you know what i mean i mean things that they would consider a weapon 

270.25 283.17 A: you know and how they would search people's things i mean really search people's things i don't think i've ever experienced anything like that even in like customs going into another country so it was definitely really different 

282.88 284.31 B: mhm oh wow 

284.80 292.05 A: but you know i mean here at least where i mean because i'm i'm i'm actually just outside of metra atlanta so i'm i'm 

291.89 300.47 A: definitely in a big melting pot [laughter] as far as you know different people from different cultures you know um people that have you know gotten 

300.47 305.34 A: citizenship from other coun- countries and people who are here like on work visas so 

305.24 317.30 A: um i thought before all it all happened i thought i had a pretty good appreciation [laughter] for you know other people and their beliefs and what not but i think after september eleventh i realized how little i really did know 

317.41 318.38 A: (( you know )) 

318.18 319.47 B: me too 

319.50 326.21 B: and and sometimes i'll i'll get so into it that i end up still going on reality overload 

326.45 335.57 B: you know just with even with iraq and everything going on now it's just like i feel like i didn't know nothing and i still feel like i don't know anything 

329.40 330.70 A: yeah 

335.65 341.06 A: well i don't think i i think that you know now they're like they should tell us everything and i 

341.25 354.42 A: i don't like to not be told things but i think that i think it's okay to pick and choose what you tell us i don't think we have to know everything because i i and this is just building on what you said about information overload i mean 

354.61 365.11 A: i feel like every time i turn on the news now you know somebody else hates us or making somebody else mad and we're gonna go to war with three different countries and you know i just [mn] 

358.68 359.77 B: mhm 

363.52 364.45 B: yeah 

365.33 370.81 B: and sometimes i think they tell us things that we shouldn't know not necessarily because 

371.00 372.87 B: we you know it's 

373.18 381.00 B: if we hear it then you know the enemy is hearing it the terrorists are hearing it you know and there's just some things that they say that 

377.96 379.07 A: that's true 

381.30 383.51 B: i don't think they should be saying 

383.80 388.88 A: no i i do you remember um back like when um it was like the gulf war 

388.84 401.81 A: and um i remember this because somebody actually brought it up on like one of the talk radio things or something recently but back when we had the gulf war and how the media was following it so closely that they were actually tipping off 

401.78 404.64 A: you know saddam hussein as to what we were doing 

404.24 405.34 B: yeah 

405.57 407.04 A: (( yeah i i i )) 

407.18 411.43 A: don't i kinda worry about that too i mean i think that 

411.45 413.94 A: you know they were saying oh um 

414.36 425.25 A: well this was after september eleventh you know we should you know be worried about nuclear power plants and we should be worried about our water supplies and stuff i think it kinda gives them ideas [laughter] you know 

424.22 425.14 B: i do 

425.26 426.37 B: i do too 

426.76 433.82 B: before they end up cutting us off because they cut us off in ten minutes i want to ask you aren't by any chance a member of big big savings are you 

434.05 439.87 A: uh no but i'm on another board well actually i am a member there but i don't post a lot

440.50 450.25 A: um but i'm i'm on you know i'm on all the deal boards and um yeah that's i mean i think we all got this little tip for this thing probably [laughter] from one 

443.93 444.72 B: oh 

450.04 458.49 B: probably but i was reading on there where some of them were catching up they were catching up oh it was you i talked to so i just thought i'd ask ahead of time

472.85 474.64 B: okay atlanta gal 

477.56 490.19 A: or in the first sale or trade and again not a lot because you know it's just one of the many boards that i you know bore through once a day just to see what's out there and what's going on but yeah that's funny so 

485.16 486.07 B: yeah 

490.13 494.57 A: so you've i haven't gone over there to read where what what forum is it under

505.38 506.44 A: [laughter] 

505.69 511.66 B: you know seeing people that caught up with each other there was i think two of 'em that actually made a match oh it was you 

511.61 520.33 A: [laughter] [laughter] well i wouldn't have even thought to ask it because i didn't know you know i mean i didn't know how widespread 

512.16 515.23 B: (( [laughter] what's it to ya so )) 

520.47 524.25 A: the advertisement for this participation was you know 

523.94 525.85 B: yeah i don't know either 

525.67 538.87 A: but we're probably getting off topic they're probably gonna listen to their tape and [laughter] but no i'll look i'll look for a post over there from you and post in it so then you'll know who i am but i'm usually on a board called deal expert 

526.82 527.62 B: yes

550.72 554.55 A: do they so what they usually just cut us off when we've 

553.97 559.08 B: fr- from what i read after ten minutes they will tell us we have to say our good-byes 

558.85 560.07 A: oh okay 

559.09 565.50 B: and then i think they ask us if we want to review it or leave a comment or something from what i read 

565.91 566.75 B: so 

567.05 568.26 B: but um 

568.76 572.03 B: i think this is pretty cool that they're doing this 

572.20 578.78 B: y- you know just kinda interesting getting to talk to somebody like like you from atlanta what you thought on september eleventh 

579.02 581.07 A: [noise] oh when it happened 

580.45 589.16 B: yeah i mean what happened and and see what some of the views are like you said you're from atlanta and i'm in a real rural area
