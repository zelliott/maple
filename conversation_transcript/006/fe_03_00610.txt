199.97 201.18 B: uh you know

206.28 211.20 B: [noise] um together to go out and you know just look at the lights you know and 

211.26 218.03 B: just make it you know big eating out maybe some of them like to eat go out or else go out to look at the lights and then come back and eat and talk you know just 

217.31 219.26 A: right that's nice yeah 

218.98 224.96 B: you know but it's funny i i well i guess with working in retail too it's funny to just sit there and see people who um 

225.93 230.44 B: you know like the men [laughter] 

227.14 228.99 A: oh yeah i know 

229.03 232.84 A: my fri- my boyfriend went out christmas eve and shopped and like thank you 

232.44 235.04 B: okay okay okay [laughter] 

233.58 244.63 A: and then he tells me then he tells me well what i bought you is not really what i wanted to buy you but it's all they had left so [laughter] so you can exchange it after a couple of weeks when they restock i'm like well that's nice isn't it 

238.76 239.47 B: (( [mn] )) 

243.94 246.85 B: oh well gee thank you very much i appreciate the 

245.48 249.50 A: yeah like you had how long to shop for it you know [laughter] you waited until

253.32 256.48 A: (( right so [mn] oh )) 

254.77 259.92 B: that is that is wild but yeah it's funny to see the man and see in here this year it um [cough] 

260.02 264.84 B: you know we had a big storm a big snowstorm so that really 

261.50 262.64 A: okay 

265.16 273.09 B: you know put a damper on the um the shopping experience because you know a lot of the people that day just you know 

268.59 269.79 A: right 

273.10 275.43 B: from the mall until like christmas eve 

274.97 275.95 A: uh-huh 

275.71 279.38 B: (( you know everybody's out like i gotta get this done i gotta get this done )) 

278.77 292.41 A: right yeah [laughter] yeah actually we had snow christmas and it everybody got ended up staying at home all day so everybody's christmas plans were changed so it was like the weekend came along and everybody had christmas on the weekend because nobody could get to anybody's houses so you 

287.38 289.10 B: right 

290.33 300.88 B: i know [laughter] but it was 'cause i you know 'cause well i went to work you know one of those stupid people that was well i went to work you know [noise] the store didn't close so you know what can you do 

292.62 294.34 A: (( know [laughter] )) 

300.49 302.43 A: right [laughter] 

301.25 304.56 B: and you know but it's just like i guess 'cause i get home 'cause you know 

304.78 311.37 B: with the timing of the sun goes down it was also kinda neat because the time i get off work there's a lot of places that are lit up 

310.94 312.92 A: yeah that's neat yeah 

312.22 314.25 B: on the way from the mall 

313.70 314.79 A: right 

314.63 322.91 B: but i guess the only disadvantage from being in the mall you know like i said our store they put christmas stuff outside in september you know by the time christmas gets here sometimes you're kinda like okay 

322.59 327.40 A: i know why can't they at least wait until after halloween before they put the decorations up and like 

324.82 325.98 B: (( you know )) 

326.17 332.98 B: you know you know the halloween twisters are right next to the turtlenecks for christmas and you're going you know you

338.53 341.53 A: (( right yeah i know we should do that [laughter] )) 

340.47 351.35 B: i'm just like but i know i go out and this is something like this year i was so proud of my well my niece made me she said you cannot buy any more christmas ornaments she said you don't even put the tree up
