151.20 151.86 A: definitely 

153.93 155.48 B: maybe at the same time 

155.89 158.47 B: uh allowing that person to kind of do 

158.75 160.63 B: some things on on your own 

160.81 163.81 A: and being introducing you to knew things even 

164.09 166.76 A: being willing willing to teach you about stuff and 

167.23 169.84 A: not expecting you to know it right away 

168.93 169.47 B: yeah 

173.66 174.27 B: (( )) here 

173.72 177.41 A: patience i think for us lately patience has been a huge one 

176.89 179.08 B: patience well when you have children 

179.09 183.28 A: that and just we've gone through some amazing trials lately 

179.66 180.56 B: it really 

181.02 181.53 B: yeah 

183.15 183.69 B: yeah 

183.71 184.17 A: um 

183.97 186.29 B: so how old did you say your child is and 

185.88 187.40 A: he's ten months old 

187.27 188.22 B: ten months old 

187.92 188.49 A: yeah 

188.32 195.25 B: so you've got a long way to go see i'm i'm older my children are twenty eight and thirty one 

190.12 191.77 A: yeah we do 

193.80 194.27 A: yeah 

195.28 195.80 A: yeah 

195.88 196.63 B: so this is 

197.13 198.02 B: and i 

197.16 200.36 A: they're older than me 

198.89 200.49 B: yeah yeah 

200.48 201.50 A: aw 

200.99 202.58 B: and i pretty well i 

202.72 204.33 B: i guess they were about nine and 

205.04 207.59 B: twelve maybe when 

207.73 210.60 B: when we were divorced and it's diff- it's very difficult 

210.74 212.64 A: were they able to handle it pretty well or 

212.49 214.11 B: um i think it change 

214.40 217.27 B: kind of changed my son's personality forever 

217.37 217.95 A: really 

217.63 222.04 B: i mean he doesn't have a real negative one but he's not as warm and lovey and fuzzy 

222.30 222.72 A: right 

222.65 225.15 B: as he was i think he's more 

223.87 226.15 A: well kids need that security too 

225.84 229.69 B: cautious and i think it effected both of them greatly but 

226.70 227.19 A: right 

230.08 234.18 B: i think being in the situation was effecting them so it was kind of like uh 

234.64 235.64 B: no win 

235.94 237.18 B: situation 

236.61 237.09 A: right 

237.32 238.18 B: but uh 

238.53 243.06 B: you know and it and it's hard in looking at a life partner when you're young 

243.12 243.53 A: right 

243.63 246.20 B: sometimes i think you don't see things 

246.63 249.21 A: and you don't necessarily know what you want yeah 

246.86 248.58 B: you know you're in love and 

248.72 251.39 B: yeah you're in love and and uh 

252.28 255.35 B: some of the thi- and i think sometimes some of the things are hidden 

255.61 256.03 A: right 

255.76 256.89 B: you know that 

256.33 257.12 A: exactly 

257.08 260.84 B: that and maybe the other person doesn't even realize that they're hiding 

261.40 265.33 B: those certain aspects of their personality i don't know that it's always the conscious 

265.62 266.10 A: right 

266.62 269.85 B: thing that they are hiding but i i i think it's certainly 

270.37 275.22 B: helps you know if you have a life partner that you know does have a good career and can 

275.67 278.07 B: you know it's money isn't make you happy but 

278.20 280.00 B: certainly is difficult if you 

280.11 281.09 A: don't have any 

280.32 282.34 B: have to struggle yeah 

281.55 282.68 A: yeah 

282.50 283.47 B: have to struggle 

283.35 286.24 A: that's been us lately too and and um 

286.66 289.25 A: another thing to add to it to is the the 

290.58 293.59 A: one thing his one thing to to be a hard worker 

293.85 295.60 A: and my dad was like that um 

295.93 296.57 B: right 

296.24 298.69 A: he's always worked really hard he continues to 

298.84 299.66 A: and uh 

299.76 301.80 A: and my husband is the same way he's 

301.84 302.41 B: yeah 

302.42 303.69 A: you know very much 

303.00 305.66 B: well that that builds your respect 

305.32 306.52 A: right exactly 

305.96 307.93 B: you know you know you 

306.95 311.47 A: and if they want to sit around the house and do nothing it's like uh 

310.55 313.90 B: right so do you work also or 

312.40 313.92 A: i do not we we've 

314.15 316.07 B: decided that's what you're 

315.53 317.79 A: we wanted me to stay home with our son 

318.06 318.45 A: from 

318.22 321.16 B: and you enjoy you enjoy the home 

318.61 319.25 A: the get go 

319.54 320.24 A: i love it 

321.27 321.73 B: um 

322.19 323.68 B: i stayed home one year 

323.98 324.42 A: did you 

324.15 329.21 B: with uh my son but i i'm a school i was a school teacher i'm a retired school teacher now 

328.54 329.32 A: oh yeah 

329.51 330.80 B: that i uh i 

330.96 331.89 B: i don't know i would just 

332.69 342.00 B: not a uh not a home person i never could get that in my i'm and i'm not i'm not saying anything about anybody else that is doing it i'm just saying that everybody is different and it wasn't 

334.72 335.27 A: yeah 

338.78 339.24 A: right 

342.79 345.78 B: i couldn't get it in my mind that that was a job 

345.93 356.45 B: you know that the right mental thing about it and and course had already taught school a couple of years so i went i went back to teaching and and it's funny when kids are little 

346.58 347.05 A: right 

352.78 353.28 A: right 

357.07 366.22 B: you know that is just what mom does you know they and they don't really think that much about it but uh i you know but it's nice

359.91 360.82 A: exactly 

363.11 363.60 A: right 

366.38 369.18 B: i think it's probably you know better for ou- a

433.86 434.34 A: right 

434.22 437.43 B: with mine cause he's been i have just a very mild mood

442.58 453.47 B: um you know but he and he'll say oh i think maybe we need to go out such and such a place you know and he's just kind even sometimes before i realize it that maybe that is all it takes is 

447.01 447.74 A: aw 

448.31 448.83 A: yeah 

453.61 465.46 B: you know whether it's just burger king or something get out and we live in a very small town so you know you always go out and we know half the people in town and and kind of visit with people and it kind of snaps you

504.81 508.16 A: and he wants to do stuff but he's stuck at home and he can't do anything and it 

508.66 509.16 B: yeah 

508.88 509.77 A: it's i i can 

510.03 511.83 A: feel his tension from that 

512.05 512.41 A: um 

512.56 513.71 A: on one hand 

512.68 514.55 B: and it's hard to know what to do

532.28 533.05 A: and we're just 

533.15 540.08 A: trying to work together and he every now and then he'll say you know i'm sorry i i don't want to stress you out i'm like it's okay it's not your fault
