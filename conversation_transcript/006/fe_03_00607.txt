300.76 302.35 B: and uh

311.82 313.10 B: violence 

313.00 314.19 A: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

316.68 319.95 B: and kind you know try to teach to teach peace 

320.30 331.24 A: right [sigh] i'm not for war um and i'm not sure about getting involved in this one right now but i do understand i've read a lot of um 

327.67 329.07 B: mhm 

331.66 336.39 A: [lipsmack] history books on different wars and things that sometimes to keep peace 

336.50 337.54 A: you 

337.67 342.80 A: [lipsmack] have to fight i mean by not fighting [sigh] you don't have freedom mhm 

343.43 353.31 B: [sigh] yeah but if you if you look back to lots of wars that have um started and and they seemed like just wars [sigh] the the reason 

353.55 354.48 B: that 

354.53 356.59 B: they started was because 

356.92 361.29 B: um tyrants were able to take power 

361.11 362.18 A: mhm 

361.92 370.38 B: um because of injustice i mean for instance if if there had been a fair settlement after the first war 

370.39 371.59 B: world war 

371.80 377.95 B: um i don't think hitler would ever have come to power but the people were suffering 

378.16 386.83 B: tremendously and he was able to you know scapegoat one particular group and [sigh] um it it you know and gain 

386.97 389.39 B: uh gain a lot of power 

389.87 395.64 B: um because the the the the german people had been treated very very unfairly after 

390.07 391.32 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

395.70 397.13 B: that first war 

397.48 401.55 B: uh they were punished and and in other words the um 

400.35 401.18 A: (( huh )) 

401.81 406.72 B: the allies um punished them severely in uh in the treaty of versailles 

407.35 408.39 A: mhm 

407.68 409.02 B: and uh 

409.16 413.61 B: i don't think we would have needed to go to war we wouldn't have had a hitler 

413.89 415.21 B: [sigh] to um 

416.14 419.85 B: to fight if uh if it hadn't been for that so [sigh] [sigh] 

419.44 432.75 A: well that may have um um helped but i think there's always tyrants who want power who want to rule and [sigh] want to have power over other countries and and that may have delayed it some but 

432.94 435.47 B: (( well and we've put some of them in in power )) 

436.07 437.32 A: mhm 

436.65 441.88 B: you know we we assassinated a democratically elected [sigh] uh allende 

442.39 446.75 B: on of all things september eleventh nineteen seventy one 

448.13 449.79 A: [sigh] where was he president 

449.63 450.74 B: (( chile ))
