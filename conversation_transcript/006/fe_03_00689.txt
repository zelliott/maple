2.34 2.79 A: hello 

3.18 3.79 B: hello 

4.39 4.76 A: hi 

5.59 7.23 B: my name is mary jo wallstork 

7.84 9.37 A: hi my name is mark etlinger 

10.48 13.53 B: i did not hear the complete question did you hear it 

13.88 15.18 A: yeah it was 

15.79 21.11 A: uh does heightened airport security reduce the chance of 

21.28 23.79 A: i think danger or attack or something like that 

27.12 28.96 B: boy the evidence doesn't show it 

30.36 30.94 A: um 

31.32 32.94 A: well i mean there hasn't been uh 

33.14 34.36 A: airplane terrorists 

34.69 35.77 A: attacks since 

35.97 37.04 A: they've heightened security 

38.47 40.44 B: so it's a good deterrence you think 

40.90 41.52 A: i think so 

42.97 46.16 B: i think it's an impossible task to catch everything 

46.75 47.90 B: so deterrence is 

48.02 48.85 B: the best we can 

49.80 50.51 B: hope for 

50.68 52.02 B: it seems like an awful lot 

52.47 54.92 B: has gotten past when they do tests so 

55.59 57.69 B: what the security actually catches 

58.61 59.77 A: yeah i think it's in 

58.96 59.55 B: so 

59.98 61.33 A: i think it's interesting when you look at 

61.60 63.16 A: different airlines 

63.27 64.07 A: uh some have 

64.19 65.70 A: a lot higher security than others 

66.34 67.00 B: that's true 

66.37 67.02 A: um i c- 

67.17 68.68 A: i know (( )) is famous 

68.94 71.86 A: for having extraordinary security and they've never had a uh 

72.09 73.12 A: a terrorist attack 

73.99 74.53 A: despite 

75.00 76.18 A: it being a prime target 

77.26 77.63 B: hm 

78.37 79.50 B: what do you think about them 

78.48 78.85 A: so 

80.32 82.66 B: having the marshals back on or arming the pilots 

83.31 84.04 A: i think that's good 

84.42 85.30 A: i think that's probably the 

84.49 85.24 B: i do too 

85.48 87.10 A: i think that works the most the best 

87.95 90.03 B: i think it would be good to know that someone 

90.20 92.19 B: else has a gun 

92.29 93.27 A: yeah 

93.23 95.85 B: other than the terrorist or the whatever they are 

97.40 97.84 A: yeah 

97.43 98.31 B: so e- it wo- 

97.99 98.28 A: (( )) 

99.20 99.58 B: pardon 

100.04 106.21 A: i was just once a a couple months ago i was on a f- flight and the first flight left from one particular city 

106.97 107.61 A: um 

107.90 111.52 A: and it didn't they didn't notice that i had a pocket knife in my pocket 

111.72 112.29 B: mhm 

112.51 115.10 A: and then the next flight was from a different city 

115.61 116.79 A: and of course i had the (( knife and )) 

117.83 119.96 A: you know get rid of the pocket knife and mail it to myself 

120.30 121.47 A: because my baggage was already checked 

122.83 123.56 A: so um 

124.11 125.15 A: i thought that was kind of interesting 

126.31 127.66 A: i guess it depended on the airport 

128.36 129.30 A: as opposed to 

129.42 129.98 A: anything else 

130.48 130.84 B: mhm 

132.28 134.29 B: i'm amazed at how 

134.70 135.30 B: how 

136.58 138.22 B: spotty it is i went on a 

138.31 139.39 B: trip that had 

139.54 142.58 B: eight legs with eight other students and 

144.73 146.24 B: the whole time i was 

147.50 148.97 B: i was never checked 

149.45 153.37 B: for the more thorough searches you know just to stand there 

149.78 150.54 A: right 

153.51 154.05 B: and 

154.30 157.93 B: some people in the party were checked every single time 

158.34 159.60 B: so 

158.58 160.72 A: i guess you must have a real innocent look about you 

160.85 166.87 B: well they say you know the the air airline security say it's totally random it's 

167.53 172.12 B: you know that it isn't any of the staff that do anything to chose it 

173.16 174.56 B: it's numbers on your 

175.14 177.61 B: ticket or or whatever but 

177.79 180.03 B: it just was really interesting to me that 

181.36 181.82 B: you know 

181.68 182.04 A: (( yeah )) 

183.12 186.52 A: actually recently i was e- at ah also at the airport obviously 

186.63 187.44 A: and um 

188.49 193.11 A: there was a g- hispanic guy who was getting i guess you know patted down and all that and he was 

192.70 193.05 B: mhm 

193.88 198.31 A: very he was asking a lot about the process that actually got him picked you know 

198.40 199.00 A: (( after he took )) 

198.52 198.97 B: mhm 

199.46 201.58 A: he sort of took it personally that he had gotten 

202.34 203.24 A: um picked 

204.68 205.52 A: to be searched 

206.14 210.13 B: well let me assure you members in my group took it personally too 

210.25 211.89 B: which is why 

212.21 216.05 B: you know our escort and our guides asked quite a lot of questions but they 

216.17 219.23 B: basically got the same answer everywhere that 

219.40 220.67 B: you know it was random 

221.37 222.43 A: yeah where were you going 

221.45 222.27 B: so 

222.81 231.56 B: oh we went out of the country and then we came back into the country we went to south america a and you know some of it might have been our destination 

223.15 224.03 A: there were eight legs 

232.03 232.38 A: right 

232.16 234.12 B: because it's a known terrorist area 

234.83 235.35 B: um 

236.68 238.61 B: we could understand that it was just 

239.69 240.78 B: very odd that 

241.54 247.30 B: certain people got picked every time and we were a multinational group um 

244.48 244.94 A: yeah 

246.79 247.19 A: mhm 

248.04 248.68 A: did that (( )) 

248.07 250.59 B: but we couldn't pick a pattern to it you know 

248.83 249.12 A: what 

251.00 251.62 B: so 

252.09 253.40 A: was it different passport different 

253.67 255.42 A: like was everyone an american citizen or was it 

255.42 258.00 B: everyone was an american citizen but 

255.76 256.49 A: some people had a different 

258.23 258.76 B: um 

264.99 269.80 B: uh the black students or uh younger black students or but 

266.88 267.22 A: right 

277.40 286.16 B: um with their (( )) passport had we gone other places but i guess we were left thinking it truly was random 

286.32 289.02 B: but it was still uh ironic so 

286.86 287.29 A: yeah 

289.93 291.61 B: now in south america oh if you just 

290.12 290.68 A: yeah 

291.96 294.29 B: tip the guards you know you got right through 

294.44 295.55 B: they don't care 

295.97 297.58 B: just coming back here 

296.07 296.91 A: yeah it's true 

298.06 299.59 A: i do have to say though that i 

299.90 303.94 A: certainly i feel like the checkers you know the like the people 

304.87 306.76 A: who control the um 

308.04 313.74 A: the metal detectors and the baggage things i feel i feel like i don't know if it's actually doing things but i feel like they're 

314.27 316.00 A: a little bit more competent than they use to be 

316.15 317.45 A: i mean if you noticed that as well 

317.01 319.86 B: oh i definitely agree they're more professional 

320.32 320.75 A: yeah 

320.83 321.39 B: um 

321.92 323.40 A: they seem to have more of a process 

323.59 324.06 B: right 

324.44 324.74 A: (( )) 

324.57 324.90 B: and 

325.46 330.44 B: they're consistently stripped uh it w- it was a challenge like going out of our uh 

331.76 340.10 B: gate all the time just to get food or whatever because it would be such a hassle to get back to get back in but it was consistently that way so 

336.05 336.40 A: yeah 

340.21 341.42 A: yeah and the first 

340.69 341.40 B: so that was 

342.10 349.25 A: the first couple months after you know like in october novem- like the first couple months after the lines were really really long but there's most the m- 

349.47 349.89 A: couple 

350.15 352.18 A: times that i've flown recently it's actually been 

352.46 353.30 A: pretty fast 

354.34 355.32 A: which i thought was good 

356.58 357.31 B: yeah 

357.43 358.61 B: it's good i eh 

360.41 360.78 B: i 

361.36 364.21 B: but then it makes you wonder if they're getting lax again or if they're 

364.92 365.39 A: yeah 

365.48 366.39 B: skipping or 

365.52 366.29 A: i think they (( )) 

367.06 367.56 B: or 

367.09 368.22 A: seems like there are more people 

369.81 374.06 A: like it before it seemed to be you know back in the olden days it seemed like there were two or three people 

374.54 377.25 A: and they would just people would just walk through and walk through and now it seem like there is 

377.56 380.46 A: you know three people looking at the monitor three peop- you know 

380.62 381.03 B: right 

380.83 383.23 A: one person handing people plastic trays 

381.48 382.52 B: you're right 

383.35 384.65 A: another person you know 

384.96 387.00 A: like three or four people with those little hands 

387.50 388.87 A: metal detectors stuff like that 

389.98 390.67 B: that's true 

390.87 391.71 B: and they're getting 

393.15 394.81 B: they're getting better at it they're getting 

395.29 395.97 B: faster at 

396.08 397.86 B: processing us all through too 

399.49 399.82 A: yeah 

400.70 401.07 A: so 

401.60 402.41 A: well hopefully 

403.54 404.70 A: i guess do you feel how do 

405.04 406.38 A: do you feel safe when you fly 

408.18 411.35 B: i do because i usually fly from this 

412.08 413.90 B: you know midwestern city that 

414.70 416.51 B: no one would want to go to so 

416.51 417.62 A: right 

417.00 418.52 B: i you know 

419.68 424.48 B: it's probably foolish but for the most part yes i feel very safe no one is uh uh 

424.86 429.14 B: of course the experience was they got on planes all over the place but 

428.86 429.15 A: um 

429.94 431.11 B: um what about you 

431.75 432.31 A: um 

432.98 433.42 A: yeah 

433.61 436.99 A: i i think so i remember the first time i flew afterwards i flew in november 

437.61 438.85 A: november two thousand one 

439.68 442.10 A: and i was pretty nervous i guess but now i uh 

442.23 443.11 A: i'm not nervous at all 

445.57 445.86 A: so 

446.03 450.25 B: i'm still more nervous of you know something actually happening to the plane than 

451.74 453.13 B: someone on board i guess 

454.03 454.46 A: yeah 

455.48 458.14 A: i wonder if the uh overall 

458.95 461.00 A: rates of people flying are 

461.54 463.79 A: back to what they were or if they're still a little off 

462.49 465.87 B: no i i just read something recently that's 

466.67 468.20 B: damaged the industry 

469.72 471.53 B: well tourism certainly 

471.80 473.88 B: and business travel too they (( )) 

472.12 473.16 A: is is still down 

474.03 476.14 B: people they're looking for alternatives 

476.62 476.98 A: yeah 

476.94 479.32 B: because too many employees don't want to fly 

479.85 480.40 B: so 

480.81 482.22 B: you know where it use to be 

482.49 483.61 B: very routine 

483.71 486.29 B: uh and plus the cost has gone up so 

487.51 491.26 B: uh both business travel and tourism are still significantly down 

492.83 496.51 A: maybe we'll get an actual working train network in this country then 

497.50 498.47 B: that would be good 

499.10 502.28 B: i would really like that i prefer train travel although those can be 

503.09 503.54 B: hijacked 

503.84 504.15 B: so 

504.36 505.49 B: is that the computer 

506.79 507.72 A: uh i don't know 

507.08 508.26 B: i'm hearing a beep 

507.85 508.34 A: is this your 

508.46 510.45 A: is this your first one or have you done one yet 

510.50 514.42 B: i did it once before and we just ended up hanging up because 

514.60 516.22 B: the computer never came in 

516.89 517.33 A: okay 

517.51 520.72 A: is it just suppose to beep or does it do a voice saying like you 

520.23 521.02 B: i don't know (( )) 

520.85 521.38 A: stop talking 

521.68 522.74 B: have you heard a voice 

523.27 523.72 A: no 

526.16 527.16 B: i have no idea 

528.53 529.26 A: neither do i 

529.43 530.98 A: this is the first one i've done 

531.82 532.50 B: but i've 

532.82 533.71 B: we've talked a long 

535.09 540.02 B: lot longer than i did the last time so i would think they have a good pattern i don't 

537.15 539.19 A: oh okay how long is it suppose to be 

540.48 546.75 B: i don't know the last time we waited around for a good five minutes and it never did anything so we both agreed to hang up 

547.43 547.83 A: okay 

548.40 548.70 B: but 

550.85 551.24 A: um 

551.58 554.46 B: it would be nice if they'd say that in the beginning you will be expected 

554.95 555.88 B: to talk for 

556.52 558.18 A: yeah the first time i got called i was like 

558.44 562.14 A: running around looking for my pin number because i have no i 

561.45 563.81 B: i know me too 

562.28 563.38 A: you know like 

564.11 570.41 B: i had it on my answering machine so i replayed it while i was waiting for the computer to 

564.38 565.25 A: there is this 

570.51 573.76 B: and it waited a long time and then i got it so now i have it handy 

573.14 573.42 A: eh 

574.51 576.36 B: i've only been doing it this week so 

574.94 575.36 A: um 

576.68 578.29 B: i don't know how long do they call you
