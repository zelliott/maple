0.74 1.97 B: jennifer 

1.66 3.76 A: hello uh this is tom 

3.62 4.63 B: hi tom 

4.36 6.00 A: how you doing 

5.37 7.13 B: i am i am fine 

6.94 11.55 A: okay [laughter] good there's this talk about national security 

11.43 13.72 B: okay have you taken one of these surveys before 

13.32 14.61 A: no 

14.01 15.98 B: okay neither have i so 

15.03 15.97 A: okay 

16.17 17.07 B: um 

17.28 19.58 B: my assumption is that um 

19.99 21.49 B: heighten airport 

22.74 24.12 B: i don't see 

24.16 28.33 B: i don't feel that uh heightened airport security is going to 

28.41 31.01 B: um diminish terrorist attacks 

31.08 32.19 A: okay 

31.70 36.58 B: i think it will i mean my opinion is that it might be a little harder for them to 

36.60 37.59 B: um 

38.76 41.08 B: i don't know get through the process of trying 

41.19 45.05 B: of getting through airports but i don't think it will diminish 

41.81 42.62 A: yeah 

45.52 46.69 B: their efforts 

46.83 51.17 A: yeah uh have you have you flown a lot since september eleventh 

50.91 52.08 B: yeah i have 

51.60 54.18 A: yeah me too it's like 

54.28 55.30 A: uh 

54.36 58.61 B: i i'm actually in l._a. and so i go through l._a._x. 

58.24 60.30 A: yeah i've been through there a little bit 

59.87 74.25 B: okay and um i don't i mean there is more security and they do do some random checks um some of the people that i fly with they do look a little scruffy at times and they will call call them out but i 

70.92 71.95 A: uh-huh 

74.31 79.55 B: i mean they're i guess their procedures in my opi- i mean i think they're looking for the wrong people 

79.78 80.78 A: yeah 

79.89 83.13 B: so i don't know how beneficial it is 

83.04 87.26 A: well the thing is like i don't know what the pr- and 'cause 

87.69 97.31 A: they supposedly the people had like uh box cutters right when they hijacked the plane which were okay to bring on airplanes you know so it's not like the security was 

97.41 104.29 A: faulty or anything you know so even if they checked the guys out it's well you can have this on there so i don't see what 

99.00 99.90 B: right 

104.73 105.96 A: i don't know 

106.19 113.22 A: but now it seems like if someone tries to take over a plane that people are just gonna freak out and not let in happen you know 

106.36 107.23 B: yeah 

112.77 124.46 B: [mn] yeah i think i think if nothing else that's the security measure that's been put in place is that people aren't gonna sit around and take it anymore i mean even if even if it were a normal hijacker even if it was some crazy loon 

119.01 121.09 A: (( yeah exactly [laughter] )) 

124.13 125.13 A: uh-huh 

124.78 125.89 B: you know who's 

126.08 134.85 B: who's your typical white blonde blue eyed guy no one is gonna put up with it they're just gonna say it's like you know what i'd rather be the person that dies on this plane to save everyone else 

128.43 129.38 A: uh-huh 

133.20 134.02 A: yeah 

134.20 140.50 A: yeah yeah and i've been flying southwest around and it's always crowded and um 

140.73 147.05 A: you can't i mean whenever you get up to go to the bathroom or anything you can't wait in line like no congestion up here so i don't know 

147.15 150.19 A: how it will work itself out and they have 

150.28 157.56 A: the uh the pilot doors are shut the whole time you know and they have this sign we are not opening the doors up so i don't know it'd be 

158.09 160.54 A: it'd be something to see 

160.57 167.94 A: but in the other the other problem with the airport security is that it's just like you know some some dudes screening people you know 

167.99 180.95 A: like if they're if they don't if they let one thing through one time when they're on the nod or whatever it's that's the problem you know we can have these great security measures but there's always going to be people behind them and people are always you know uh 

181.00 185.53 A: have stayed up too late or be hungry or whatever and that's what's going to cause the problem you know 

185.61 189.74 A: not the measures but the people putting it in place 

189.30 196.63 B: yeah yeah i really agree because uh i mean i do have to i mean i do say that the people that 

189.95 191.03 A: (( i don't know )) 

196.95 201.99 B: have been hired or or are still or still hold their positions are not 

202.37 204.54 B: i mean i don't really think they care 

204.48 205.61 A: yeah 

204.88 210.03 B: one way or the other it's just they only care because they will get in trouble 

210.32 211.12 B: um 

210.43 217.97 A: yeah well i don't know it's even if people do care you know you can't be a hundred percent all the time you know what i mean yeah 

216.12 220.10 B: right yeah i guess i put it i don't i guess that's 

220.29 224.93 B: that's too harsh of a statement to say that they don't care but it's more that 

221.92 222.87 A: [laughter] 

224.96 229.78 B: they're not paid to be uh you know a hundred percent vigilant they can't be no one can be 

227.95 230.71 A: right right exactly yeah yeah 

230.04 233.48 B: unless you're in israel and you're in the military and you're paid to do [laughter] 

231.99 234.71 A: [laughter] yeah well 

235.36 240.16 A: i hear there if uh they have any qualms about a flight cancelled 

240.26 245.00 A: like they just cancel flights if they they have you know a bad feeling about it 

245.05 250.36 B: yeah since september eleventh i've seen several documentaries on um what they do in israel 

249.89 251.46 A: yeah it's intense 

251.05 257.41 B: it's yeah i was really i mean after i saw that i was really scared i mean i could understand what they're doing 

251.72 252.89 A: [laughter] 

257.00 258.04 A: uh-huh 

257.59 261.56 B: but i just thought i would never want to go through their airport ever 

261.13 271.86 A: right don't you have to like you have like an hour long interview or something everybody on the plane before they get on they have to everyone has to talk to the security chief or something crazy like that 

270.36 276.08 B: yeah and i think if i'm not mistaken it's like four to six checkpoints like four to six people can interview you 

275.72 276.91 A: yeah 

276.24 277.19 B: um 

278.15 279.24 B: and i mean 

279.41 280.28 B: (( and )) 

279.49 280.48 A: uh-huh 

281.71 282.55 B: everything 

281.77 286.29 A: well on the other hand they haven't had any any problems 

286.04 287.84 B: no they haven't 

286.95 294.58 A: since they started doing all that but you know that's the that's the slippery slope question right you know how much do you want to give up et cetera 

294.41 305.24 B: well and too i think of it um in terms of i mean israel is a fairly small country and they only i don't know how many i think they only have the one international airport there 

304.62 306.41 A: that's true yeah yeah 

305.98 309.08 B: and we're looking at a country that's 

309.36 311.63 B: you know fifty times bigger than they are 

311.38 313.31 A: at least yeah 

312.79 314.02 B: we have 

314.15 317.26 B: i think we have over a hundred international airports so 

317.71 318.60 B: it's 

318.98 322.59 B: oh no we don't have that many 'cause most of the middle states don't have any 

321.92 328.65 A: but still can you imagine like interviewing everyone at l._a._x. at any given time i mean that place is like a beehive in there it's insane 

325.81 326.96 B: yeah 

328.44 329.63 B: yeah 

328.80 332.24 A: and i'm sure that the ones on the east coast are the same story 

332.86 334.17 B: yeah yeah 

334.89 337.24 A: the thing that freaks me out about uh 

337.30 348.20 A: airplanes and that is i read this article about like shoulder mounted guided missiles that you can you know get on the black market for like a thousand bucks 

348.15 362.61 A: and that you know how are you going to stop that from happening some guy driving up on a pickup truck and shooting a plane out of the sky as soon as it takes off because you know the commercial jets don't have anything to prevent that like the military ones do 

363.82 365.27 B: yeah 

364.60 371.83 A: so when i fly that's what i'm worried about now and not so much someone on the plane but someone you know in the neighbourhood who is going to shoot it down 

372.41 374.03 A: but let's hope that doesn't happen 

372.68 375.90 B: i hadn't thought about that but um 

375.02 376.04 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

376.05 377.18 B: you're right 

376.97 377.89 A: (( yeah uh-hum [mn] )) 

377.90 383.25 B: i mean there's i mean there's just a hundred different i mean a hijacker now is 

383.45 386.07 B: there is so many different ways that they can 

386.32 387.15 B: um 

387.61 390.95 B: you do something to a plane or your airport or 

392.23 393.62 B: anything else like 

394.30 398.09 B: i guess to a certain extent i'm wondering if um 

398.40 402.09 B: all the focus seemed on making sure that passengers and everything 

402.11 403.50 B: aren't terrorists 

403.90 404.76 B: is 

405.42 408.66 B: um maybe deflecting some of the other ways that 

408.76 411.01 B: other things that we should be looking at 

410.58 413.49 A: yeah it seems like it because 

413.64 417.01 A: i don't understand some of the security things like ah 

418.36 420.06 A: like um 

421.09 429.84 A: the at the curb side check ins how they suspended that for a while i didn't really understand why that would matter 

430.11 431.40 B: i didn't either 

431.10 433.22 A: it just doesn't i mean 

433.01 437.43 B: they ask you the same questions and they do the same things as if you were walking up to the front 

433.41 434.37 A: okay 

437.03 444.82 A: yeah i don't i didn't get it at all i don't see how i don't know it just seems like if you're gonna make a bomb 

444.72 452.88 A: and you're willing to sort of kill yourself to get in on you'll just drive to the airport and set if off before anyone can tell you to move your car sort of you know 

452.76 453.67 B: right 

453.54 458.33 A: but then why would you blow up an airport you know downtown 

458.80 465.01 A: san francisco or something and just blow that up or a bunch or people i don't know just scary to think about 

466.83 473.31 A: but i but i guess these stories of people being turned away with you know pocket knives and nail clippers and stuff 

473.86 478.11 A: show that i guess that people aren't sort of doing their jobs 

478.61 483.70 A: but if i guess the point i made earlier is that they were doing their jobs before you know they 

483.83 486.83 A: you were allowed to have pocket knives and stuff 

486.97 489.11 A: that's sort of strange 

489.22 490.61 B: yeah 

489.98 504.93 A: so it seems like this this emphasis on more security isn't misses the point sort of it wasn't that people were asleep at the job it's just that we weren't ready for what happened and it seems like a str- yeah it's like you said people have sort of a cosmetic response you know 

505.46 507.77 A: making sure of doing something 

508.05 510.05 A: instead of actually [mn] 

510.07 511.19 B: i would agree 

510.78 513.42 A: yeah yeah 

513.59 514.44 B: so 

516.29 520.60 B: i guess do you think do you know if they change the questions on us or 

520.33 528.60 A: i i got one the other night i didn't feel like talking about so i just i just said not tonight press nine nine for deny 

528.65 530.01 B: oh okay 

529.68 533.54 A: yeah i thought we were actually gonna be able to pick what we were gonna talk about 

532.83 536.98 B: well i had a friend of mine told me about this and she and 

535.41 536.44 A: uh-huh 

537.21 542.43 B: i i thought it was a questionnaire i didn't realize that you were actually going to talk to someone else about 

541.80 552.82 A: yeah it's misleading the thing i thought we were going to be talking to a robot or something [laughter] [laughter] the way it said it and then i read more that i was like uh i'll just do it anyway it'll be weird and fun 

546.27 547.16 B: right 

554.22 555.26 A: (( yeah i don't know )) 

555.16 558.82 B: (( yeah [laughter] i had no idea either [laughter] this is so strange )) 

555.85 556.77 A: [laughter] 

558.48 560.98 A: yeah i wonder how many people are doing it 

560.36 562.90 B: yeah i wonder too this is really weird 

562.52 571.64 A: and i bet all the conversations get to this point where people talk about it the project more than the topic that's what's more interesting you know than any of the topics 

571.36 578.52 B: yeah because you can only talk about the topic so much without having like some kind of fuel added to it to spark up 

574.17 575.52 A: yeah 

577.42 582.48 A: yeah exactly right like well i disagree with everything 

581.73 584.42 B: yeah [laughter] you guys don't know what you're talking about [laughter] 

583.72 586.19 A: (( yeah it's hard to )) 

585.15 586.80 B: i feel more secure 

586.47 590.12 A: (( [laughter] yeah right you know i hadn't thought of that )) 

590.37 593.86 A: and i guess someone's gonna have to listen to all these too or something which is 

594.33 596.23 A: which can't be a fun job 

596.23 597.25 B: no 

596.88 598.86 A: [laughter]
