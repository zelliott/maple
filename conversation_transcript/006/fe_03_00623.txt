188.92 189.50 B: oh my 

189.80 192.33 A: major thing was that she just kept thinking 

192.58 193.94 A: there's no way we could share 

194.85 196.16 A: child rearing 

195.67 196.44 B: ah 

196.38 199.37 A: you no there's no way we could raise children together because th-

201.10 201.93 B: everything 

201.89 205.23 A: about religion and even education he's uh

216.52 218.25 A: and and he didn't you know (( )) 

220.27 225.11 A: it it wasn't important to him he's just he's not a studier and a reader so and sh- 

222.19 222.84 B: oh yeah 

224.92 226.03 B: yeah i have 

225.40 226.81 A: couldn't imagine that so

247.73 249.84 A: well see that's what i did with mine is 

250.02 250.93 A: from the minute 

251.03 252.82 A: they they were born it was never 

253.34 256.80 A: if you go (( at school )) when you go and you know you need to 

254.50 255.20 B: no it's w- 

255.49 255.86 B: it's 

256.14 257.55 B: you're going 

256.90 257.41 A: yeah you 

257.57 261.97 A: you need to study really hard so you can get a scholarship when you go because it was 

259.75 260.23 B: right 

260.52 264.54 B: that's that's exactly right i've already told this one and we have a 

265.60 269.40 B: special college here it's a christian college and she's already 

268.32 268.73 A: mhm 

269.87 274.40 B: already made the statement that's where she wants to go it's only a two year college but

275.95 276.43 A: mhm

277.43 278.58 B: could get a 

279.05 280.15 B: scholarship you know 

280.44 280.75 B: so 

281.10 284.60 B: i mean you know she's only in the first grade but you got to work at it from the 

281.22 281.47 A: (( )) 

283.26 283.72 A: yeah 

284.77 285.61 B: from the beginning 

285.66 289.63 A: you have to yeah that's and that's what my oldest did when she broke up with her boyfriend is that 

290.51 291.24 A: you know it's just 

291.58 292.56 A: so many things that 

292.99 296.18 A: they disagree with and i guess that's how i look at i'm older now and 

296.37 297.01 B: oh yeah 

297.08 297.59 A: so uh 

297.84 298.78 A: life partner

306.59 307.74 B: oh i know uh 

307.25 310.83 A: safe myself some trouble but you know i look at it uh shit we've 

308.86 309.28 B: yeah 

311.35 313.84 A: we talked about it a lot like i said she broke up with him just a 

313.94 316.98 A: a few months ago so we talked about it a lot before she did 

317.35 319.77 A: because she cares so much about him but she was trying to 

320.73 324.80 A: you know talk they were talking about marriage when she finished college and everything and it just 

324.53 324.94 B: yeah 

325.36 325.72 A: uh 

326.33 329.06 A: and that's some of the things she kept mentioning is that uh 

329.57 330.00 A: you know 

330.22 332.55 A: being able to raise their children together because uh 

333.35 335.90 A: uh we the religious beliefs they weren't

337.90 338.33 A: now he's 

338.70 343.26 A: he goes to church and everything but it's just more of whatever the preacher tells me to do

343.75 345.13 A: and she's more of 

345.28 346.58 A: i want to work out my

387.99 388.50 A: and uh

420.34 420.66 B: (( )) 

421.93 424.25 A: if you don't get on there and even if you do 

424.45 426.03 A: it it's just really it's it's 

426.66 428.23 A: uh it's (( shift work )) and 

428.36 430.61 A: it's just really bad health wise 

430.38 430.95 B: oh yeah 

431.26 431.91 A: and um 

432.65 433.06 A: it's just

435.37 435.93 B: no 

435.97 437.39 A: you have to consider that if 

437.56 438.60 A: if they you know 

438.69 439.84 B: oh yeah what 

439.39 440.08 A: will they move

451.79 452.22 A: (( )) 

451.83 452.89 B: well i live in west 

452.62 454.37 A: definitely rural 

453.10 456.12 B: tennessee northwest i live in northwest tennessee 

455.92 456.58 A: okay 

456.94 458.11 B: up by paris about 

458.51 460.30 B: uh fifteen miles from paris 

461.21 461.51 A: so 

461.61 463.71 A: uh are you in a rural area or 

463.39 463.99 B: yeah 

463.98 464.28 A: kind of 

464.10 466.62 B: it's a very it's a small town you know but 

467.48 468.94 B: just barely a town you know 

469.05 469.45 A: yeah 

469.60 471.26 B: two grocery stores you know 

471.37 472.23 A: yeah yeah 

471.92 474.85 B: couple dollar stores and that's about no walmart you know 

474.79 475.93 A: yeah i'm close to a 

475.43 476.05 B: have to go 

476.41 476.98 B: farther to 

477.10 478.20 B: get to walmart 

478.18 478.76 A: yeah that's 

478.87 480.15 A: where we are here and 

479.77 480.05 B: yeah 

480.33 480.81 B: small 

481.24 483.45 B: but i like it for the kids i like it 

481.33 481.67 A: uh 

483.68 484.04 A: well 

484.32 486.73 A: i i really like for me but actually it does that's 

486.82 489.45 A: one of the reasons i don't like it where we're at right now is 

489.76 490.85 A: because mine uh 

491.26 493.47 A: i've got a boy that just turned fourteen yesterday 

493.66 496.03 A: and and my seventeen year old is still at home 

493.72 494.14 B: uh-huh 

496.22 500.15 A: and there's absolutely nothing for them they have to drive an hour even to see a movie 

499.41 502.17 B: oh i know there's not even a skating rink here you know 

501.39 501.70 A: yeah 

501.84 503.74 A: uh uh there's nothing here and also 

503.49 504.83 B: that that's the way it is here 

503.93 506.13 A: so that's bothersome you know because they don't 

505.59 514.65 B: but you know even in the big town even in paris there's hardly nothing for kids they do have a skating rink they've got movie theatre you know but that's about it
