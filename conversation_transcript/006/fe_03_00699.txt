65.75 66.59 A: yeah 

65.91 71.30 B: you know and we have so much government controlling on everything so why can't they do that 

71.03 75.05 A: right and the way they fixed it this time was 

75.24 77.60 A: microwave the meal basically 

76.49 77.05 B: (( [noise] )) 

77.19 78.48 B: yeah

81.94 83.53 A: doing any damage 

83.04 84.03 B: mhm 

84.93 86.98 A: [noise] they could do stuff like that 

86.54 91.14 B: oh i'm sure there is way they that they could control [noise] have better control 

91.20 94.20 B: like say with technology as great as they are

104.31 105.05 A: no 

105.61 106.49 A: i mean 

106.75 109.07 A: it's it's basically just a 

109.79 112.77 A: our technology has gotten so bad that 

111.45 113.20 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

113.32 114.64 A: they can do 

115.14 116.75 A: warfare with 

116.95 119.38 A: chemicals without actually 

121.18 122.42 A: throwing a bomb 

123.05 126.06 A: and basically that's basically we are at war 

125.78 127.22 B: mhm

178.60 179.63 B: mhm 

179.49 181.24 A: but they just blew 'em off 

180.88 181.89 B: mhm

216.19 217.49 A: yeah 

217.78 221.96 A: (( well we're gotta stay on this task we gotta talk about biochemics )) 

223.22 224.37 B: mhm 

224.43 226.39 A: anyway um 

229.09 230.76 A: are you afraid to open your mail 

233.47 234.57 B: no not at all 

235.41 236.34 B: are you 

236.25 237.03 A: no 

236.91 240.96 B: yeah i think i i have confidence 

241.10 242.36 B: that you know 

244.26 251.17 B: that these thing now does make aware in and things like that that they are better control 

251.55 253.18 B: better monitor 

252.94 253.88 A: (( mhm )) 

255.00 257.88 A: are you afraid to go into like a mall or 

257.53 258.36 B: no 

258.52 260.93 B: you can't be afraid i mean to me 

258.53 259.19 A: (( a )) 

261.62 266.75 B: to me i live a good life i'm not afraid of dying [laughter] although i'm not 

265.27 265.92 A: (( no )) 

266.82 269.69 B: so no i'm not afraid of anything 

269.71 270.67 A: yeah 

270.18 277.07 B: and i refuse to let somebody else control my life by putting fear in me 

277.09 277.96 A: right 

277.92 279.75 B: so no not at all 

279.96 283.65 A: do you watch news regularly to to see what's going on 

282.51 287.99 B: mmm not really on and off i usually listen in morning when i go to work um 

287.50 288.42 A: (( mhm )) 

288.32 290.15 B: and to see what's 

290.60 294.28 B: going on in today's world and that's about it 

294.45 298.45 A: that's what i used to do you know when i was going to work i'm laid off right now but 

298.16 299.37 B: (( oh really )) 

298.72 299.75 A: um 

300.94 303.01 A: i refuse to watch the news 

302.44 303.58 B: mhm 

303.69 307.33 A: because all the news is doing is trying to find the worst story 

307.41 310.30 A: and twist it to make it a little worse and mhm 

309.34 318.76 B: right as a matter of fact if you after them what happen with nine eleven i think the media could actually brainwash people to believe what they want you to believe 

318.32 319.43 A: mhm 

318.82 326.66 B: like they were saying now oh iraq does not have these kind of technology and um i don't believe it i think they do 

327.79 329.86 B: they have it twelve years ago 

330.62 331.57 A: right 

330.71 333.40 B: now i think they even have more 

332.93 335.98 A: yeah 'cause they had uh chemicals back then 

335.89 336.87 B: (( mhm )) 

336.84 338.35 A: 'cause i know a couple of people 

337.33 339.99 B: and then you're talking about that was twelve years ago 

339.56 341.05 A: (( mhm )) 

340.55 343.15 B: so definitely going to have a lot more now 

342.80 344.06 A: (( right mhm )) 

344.54 355.85 B: um i don't know who they're going to use them against there's a couple of theories i have one is to use it in a neighboring country so that they could have control and have uh more 

355.98 357.57 B: um power 

357.88 359.69 B: to take on the u._s. 

360.47 361.29 B: so 

361.36 363.49 B: how long are we supposed to talk [laughter] oh 

363.24 367.81 A: i don't know they're supposed to come on and end it it was thirty seconds 

365.93 367.10 B: (( okay oh )) 

367.24 373.14 B: okay and um so therefore as much as i hate war 

374.53 376.85 B: i i think we have no choice 

377.54 378.97 B: to prevent 

380.24 381.10 A: right 

380.65 381.69 B: (( you know )) 

381.83 383.31 B: what's gonna happen 

383.18 385.32 A: we need to protect our country 

384.93 386.49 B: yes we do 

386.05 388.73 A: and i did get an email you know 

388.76 390.70 A: and it was an awesome 

390.73 392.40 A: email because 

392.42 394.21 A: it said [noise] 

394.77 396.57 A: (( something about )) 

396.98 403.67 A: one of the big wigs like saddam like or something was gonna give a hundred thousand dollars to anybody that would kill an american 

403.40 407.86 B: mhm oh yeah i know that for a fact and i can't reveal the source 

407.87 408.81 A: right 

408.31 412.91 B: so i don't want to put myself in jeopardy but yeah that is a fact 

412.88 418.25 A: right but it in this newsletter it said [noise] well this email it said that um 

418.75 428.12 A: what is an american we all are americans there is not just one nationality here it's every nationality in this country 

423.96 425.38 B: exactly 

427.51 428.52 B: mhm 

428.56 430.78 A: and to be an american 

431.00 432.04 A: you know 

432.15 435.75 A: it could be saddam he could be an american 

435.41 436.44 B: mhm 

436.62 437.71 A: it it 

436.75 440.88 B: look at bin laden's own family that was living in u._s. for how long 

440.50 441.79 A: mhm 

441.20 442.24 B: (( you know )) 

442.49 443.69 B: so but 

445.51 447.86 B: his idea is that 

449.81 460.31 B: the bad thing about it is that if his people were only know how we really are compassionate caring and all that they probably wouldn't have that kind of hatred against us 

459.96 460.91 A: uh-huh 

460.51 461.52 B: (( you know )) 

461.73 463.59 B: (( but in that )) 

463.83 466.47 B: they are brainwashed from the day they were born 

466.37 467.23 A: yeah 

466.97 472.90 B: so they have no qualm about him using any kinda chemical thing against anybody 

472.71 479.79 A: uh and like it said in this email that it's sad because we've helped every country out in one way or another 

479.80 481.24 A: over the years 

480.68 481.56 B: mhm 

481.81 494.35 B: i know it's amazing how it's as i mentioned to my husband say why can't we be selfish and just pret- take all the military out every country and just surround our border 

494.48 496.56 B: but then he say that with a chemical 

496.61 503.53 B: uh warfare and all that it wouldn't help because they could shoot in the air or whatever but then why can't we intercept it 

503.66 504.59 B: (( you know )) 

504.16 505.29 A: i don't know 

505.96 508.50 B: i think it's about time we should protect us 

508.62 509.55 A: yeah 

509.94 514.77 B: we have enough force that could protect us for sure 

514.58 515.50 A: yeah 

514.87 517.61 B: 'cause we have military all over the world 

517.42 520.25 A: yeah and it but my thing is 

520.29 521.65 A: if they're going 

521.69 528.62 A: going to get to the military they need to protect us they need to pay the military more 

527.99 530.26 B: [mn] oh i totally agree 

530.53 534.66 A: i mean congress has no problem with giving themselves a raise but 

534.72 538.23 B: well how about giving to other country money for that 

537.17 538.04 A: yeah 

538.19 547.21 A: i mean uh military is a lot of military families are live on welfare because [noise] they can't make it on the pension or the money that military pays them 

546.61 551.52 B: mhm exactly and we know how hard it is for um 

552.88 558.08 B: military spouse to go to another country and try to get a job you know it's not easy 

556.26 557.02 A: (( [mn] yep )) 

557.91 559.17 A: no it's not 

558.47 559.59 B: so 

559.61 564.52 B: and i know they don't get paid too much so i i agree totally 

564.63 566.99 B: give them better housing too [laughter] 

567.63 568.55 B: so 

568.45 569.89 A: (( i don't know it ma- )) 

570.36 574.45 A: the the warfare it scares me because they could 

574.60 579.45 A: do so much effect just by one little bomb that's got all these 

577.94 579.00 B: mhm 

579.48 581.51 A: bad chemicals and stuff 

581.74 582.61 A: (( you know )) 

582.93 585.09 A: that's the reason why we got cancer 

584.71 586.34 B: right right 

586.14 588.30 A: is because of the radio- uh 

588.54 589.95 A: uh the 

589.05 595.05 B: well the chemical is even worse because you don't live do you suffer 

594.81 595.79 A: yeah 

595.31 599.89 B: and like you say i'm not afraid for myself 'cause i enjoy live a real good life 'cause
