10.62 12.04 A: i think probably christmas 

12.57 14.83 B: i think a lot of people feel that way 

12.77 13.29 A: and i 

15.06 17.51 A: i think the reason i like christmas best 

17.87 20.16 A: is because being russian orthodox 

20.46 21.64 A: i have two christmases 

21.93 23.11 B: oh 

22.73 27.64 A: huh i celebrate christmas january seventh as well as december twenty fifth 

25.82 26.41 B: uh-huh 

27.90 28.82 B: oh well that's 

28.91 33.32 B: nice that's lucky for you especially since it's your favorite holiday 

29.58 30.04 A: um 

31.32 32.11 A: right 

33.78 34.41 A: mhm 

34.39 35.06 B: oh 

35.56 36.04 A: um 

36.44 39.35 A: i think the children really enjoy it because of the fact 

39.58 41.45 A: you know that it's being celebrated twice 

41.59 42.14 B: uh-huh 

42.75 44.44 B: and so then 

45.02 45.69 B: do you have 

45.86 47.53 B: gifts at both holidays 

47.41 52.87 A: we h- we give gifts for both holidays what we do as far as adults are concerned is we divide 

49.41 49.99 B: uh-huh 

53.18 54.93 A: which holiday it's going to be 

55.15 55.57 B: uh-huh 

55.51 57.03 A: and it's just for one holiday 

57.23 59.40 A: with children it's for both holidays 

57.32 57.87 B: oh i 

58.19 58.53 B: uh-huh 

59.48 60.03 B: uh-huh 

60.89 61.28 B: well 

60.92 61.32 A: what is yo- 

61.53 62.95 A: what is your favorite holiday 

63.32 65.96 B: well i think my favorite holiday probably is 

66.10 66.98 B: thanksgiving 

67.37 68.14 A: mhm 

67.71 68.27 B: um 

68.56 69.84 A: all the good food 

69.73 75.13 B: i love to cook yes and i love to cook thanks th- k- thanksgiving meal 

71.89 72.41 A: right 

75.49 76.15 A: mhm 

75.77 76.86 B: and um 

77.77 78.23 B: and a and 

78.44 83.50 B: for me i find even though i like christmas with all the decorations and the lights 

84.10 84.64 A: right 

84.50 87.03 B: and all that goes with um 

87.93 89.26 B: it's less stressful 

89.73 92.12 B: thanksgiving to me is much less stressful 

92.11 95.21 A: oh i think it would be because there isn't all the shopping 

95.34 96.26 B: exactly 

95.58 95.84 A: uh 

96.20 96.70 A: right 

96.63 97.41 B: exactly um and 

97.53 98.34 B: and who do i 

98.57 102.29 B: what do i get for whom and will they like and 

102.79 109.63 B: you know and then it gets i can remember back when i was first married and how stressful it was because of course money was very tight and 

109.95 116.43 A: and not only that but you don't know what to get for in-laws because you don't know their you don't know their likes and dislikes that much 

112.86 114.05 B: exactly 

116.07 117.72 B: mhm exactly 

116.77 117.66 A: mhm 

118.01 118.80 B: and uh 

118.13 118.66 A: right 

119.80 121.09 B: so i just 

121.21 128.92 B: you know as far as a a relaxing family get together type thing i just have always felt partial to thanksgiving 

129.19 132.15 A: well i'll admit this i like the holiday also 

134.51 139.38 A: i'm just trying to think if we could make up a holiday what would it be 

140.27 140.95 A: wow 

141.47 142.78 A: that's a difficult one 

142.62 148.81 B: that would yes that's not something you think about everyday because we have so many holidays to celebrate 

149.07 149.91 A: exactly 

149.63 153.91 B: for so many reason and uh to throw one more in there 

154.63 155.39 A: mhm 

155.08 158.14 B: you know i just once again i go back to the 

159.31 166.07 B: the stress and i think of all the people that uh are not able to celebrate holidays like they would like to 

166.13 166.95 A: your right 

167.09 168.35 B: and uh 

168.90 171.42 B: (( )) i guess maybe that's one reason too about 

171.53 172.56 B: christmas because 

173.20 175.45 B: i have an imprint of my mind 

175.46 176.09 A: right 

175.78 177.82 B: in my mind when my kids were little 

178.26 182.29 B: and i didn't have a whole lot but we always managed to have a nice christmas 

182.31 182.83 A: yes 

183.28 186.90 B: and i had a friend who was i went to high school with 

187.01 187.57 A: mhm 

187.45 189.26 B: she had five little kids 

189.48 190.82 B: she loved kids 

189.88 190.39 A: right 

190.98 191.57 B: and this 

191.99 192.62 B: girl had 

192.71 194.31 B: five kids as fast as she could 

195.46 196.51 B: and i 

195.72 197.70 A: and that's a lot to go shopping for 

197.30 199.15 B: oh and well i remember 

199.60 203.73 B: it was the christmas eve day one year and i ran into her 

202.81 203.32 A: mhm 

204.21 205.23 B: at one of the malls 

205.65 206.22 A: right 

206.08 209.48 B: and she was out her husband had just got his paycheck 

210.12 215.10 B: and she's out there frantically trying to buy christmas for her kids and you know 

215.33 215.66 B: that has 

215.77 217.65 B: stuck with me and i felt 

217.91 223.22 B: so bad for her because number one they had hardly enough to live on anyway 

222.85 224.06 A: to live on yes 

224.35 228.97 B: and then here she is with and he didn't get his paycheck until that day and she's out trying to 

228.63 232.28 A: and she's out there the last minute trying to get something for the children 

230.01 231.02 B: mhm 

231.96 232.97 B: exactly 

232.89 236.94 A: and how do you explain to children that there really isn't enough of money around 

236.99 237.43 B: that's 

237.27 238.94 A: to be buying them what they want 

238.98 240.51 B: right right and that's 

240.71 244.62 B: that has all i have used to feel i felt so bad about that 

244.97 245.61 A: mhm 

245.22 249.15 B: and i didn't have any resources to step in and help her with it you know 

248.64 249.19 A: right 

249.52 249.97 A: yes 

250.18 251.40 B: and so e- 

251.56 255.19 B: just like uh the commercial side of this holiday 

255.04 255.78 A: mhm 

255.54 257.12 B: is just so heavy but 

256.78 257.11 A: (( why )) 

257.40 261.15 A: i think we've commercialized a lot of the holidays now unfortunately 

262.20 266.10 B: i think so too i i agree with you because it that's what it 

263.49 263.91 A: yes 

266.27 268.55 B: so you get these companies involved in it 

268.39 269.10 A: mhm 

269.21 275.57 B: they want to make that uh bottom line dollar and so it's push push push and we ah we're like sheep we just 

273.67 274.43 A: exactly 

275.69 276.84 B: fall right into their 

276.24 282.95 A: you just follow right along with it exactly you know now that i'm thinking i think i'd like a holiday that's for pets 

277.28 277.86 B: mhm 

278.14 279.04 B: that's right 

284.12 285.02 B: well there you go 

285.59 286.39 B: there you go that's 

286.55 286.86 B: yeah 

286.63 287.26 A: mhm 

286.95 289.57 B: that would be a good one to start if they were going to do one 

287.95 289.00 A: right because 

289.89 293.27 A: i love animals any and all types of animals 

293.39 293.91 B: mhm 

293.82 294.32 A: and 

295.36 296.73 A: you know i mean i give my 

296.88 299.51 A: my dog gifts anyway even if it isn't a holiday 

299.04 300.13 B: right 

299.94 302.30 A: but i think it would be nice to have 

302.58 303.84 A: a holiday for them 

303.97 307.88 B: right and and and and then have the holiday and 

304.29 304.73 A: um 

308.08 311.40 B: (( )) to get away from the commercial quality of it is t- 

310.66 311.36 A: yes 

311.49 312.05 B: (( )) 

312.69 314.26 B: kindness to your pet 

314.38 316.73 B: and care and and um 

314.45 315.60 A: mhm 

317.02 319.10 B: eh the neutering and 

319.24 320.74 B: all of that that goes with it 

320.75 321.29 A: right 

321.26 323.87 B: and really highlight those points 

323.95 327.87 A: and you know that might be something that would help children too because 

328.16 331.98 A: i mean you hear of so much in the way of abuse happening to animals 

331.82 332.34 B: mhm 

332.45 332.94 A: and 

333.22 338.70 A: my feeling is if they were exposed to pets at a young age and had to take care of them 

338.99 341.61 A: etcetera that maybe it would make a difference in how they would 

341.73 342.38 A: respond 

342.50 343.42 B: exactly 

342.69 343.87 A: as years go on 

344.06 351.91 B: right and i think an and an abused child the way they're treated is the way they treat animals in a lot of instances and 

349.72 350.07 A: yes 

351.20 351.64 A: yes 

352.27 352.97 A: that's true 

352.64 353.62 B: and um 

354.22 355.18 B: you know to 

355.48 361.32 B: to educate a child in the fact that what happens to me and and how i feel 

361.71 363.80 B: that animal can feel the same way 

361.99 362.32 A: right 

363.86 364.46 A: mhm 

364.23 368.80 B: and to know that they they hurt and they have pain and all of that too 

368.66 369.20 A: right 

370.11 370.56 B: that would 

370.36 370.66 A: yeah 

370.74 372.65 B: that would really follow through so 

372.43 373.06 A: mhm 

373.49 375.67 A: can you think of any type of a holiday 

375.78 376.26 A: that we could 

377.03 378.12 B: well you know i eh 

378.73 380.16 A: that we could come up with 

380.00 383.05 B: i have one other one would be to um 

383.66 385.04 B: a holiday for singles 

385.35 387.51 A: oh very good idea 

386.43 386.91 B: um 

387.45 392.02 B: that was well it's it's not an original one on my part but um 

392.69 394.15 A: really you mean someone has 

394.43 396.73 B: someone someone else had mentioned that 

395.12 396.31 A: had suggested this 

396.91 405.51 B: (( )) someone else had mentioned that to me and you know once you think about it there are so many single people and there are so many transitional people 

405.01 405.60 A: right 

405.74 408.45 B: oh across the country that um 

408.69 414.63 B: i know i have a i have a single daughter whose in her mid thirties and um a lot of times 

412.15 412.68 A: mhm 

414.95 415.91 B: you know she'll show up 

416.62 419.45 B: for the family but y- leaves you know 

418.47 419.12 A: right 

419.63 427.25 B: works it so that she gets together with a group of single friends who uh maybe their families are not in town close by or 

427.46 428.06 A: mhm 

427.95 431.53 B: and there's just a group they just gravitate you know because they do so many things together 

431.13 431.69 A: oh yes 

431.93 435.60 B: and they gravitate and they'll celebrate whatever holiday that happens to be 

431.97 432.48 A: yes 

435.35 435.90 A: mhm 

436.27 439.62 A: well you know in the same respect you might think then in terms of a holiday for 

439.95 441.12 A: people who are 

441.30 442.36 A: either widowed or 

442.86 443.68 A: or divorced 

444.18 446.18 A: because they too probably 

447.22 447.90 B: yes 

447.37 450.55 A: in other words need something where they can get together 

448.39 448.77 B: yeah 

450.73 454.88 B: right a lot of people right a lot of people like that are alone on holidays and 

454.31 454.91 A: mhm 

455.46 456.26 A: exactly 

455.49 459.17 B: and uh or just just make it a blanket holiday for 

459.88 460.81 B: anyone alone 

461.03 461.49 A: right 

461.54 463.90 B: anyone without family without 

464.69 465.07 B: you know 

465.35 466.35 B: close ties 

465.37 465.73 A: yes 

466.49 467.04 A: mhm 

467.94 468.33 A: and 

468.56 470.13 A: i guess this also happens 

470.26 472.44 A: as people get on in years where 

472.80 474.47 A: all of a sudden they're without a mate 

474.86 475.40 B: mhm 

475.12 476.90 A: and it would help them to 

477.56 480.77 A: to have a holiday where possibly they could get together with others 

481.09 481.59 B: mhm 

482.66 483.90 A: sounds like a very good idea 

483.02 483.95 B: yeah i could i could 

484.05 485.32 B: see something like that 

485.63 487.70 B: working see something like that happening 

487.72 488.45 A: mhm 

488.50 489.35 B: and uh 

490.66 491.44 A: i'm sure the c- 

490.70 494.27 B: because there are s- you know there are so many people alone on holidays j- 

494.38 494.71 B: for 

494.48 494.98 A: right 

494.91 496.25 B: for so many different reasons 

496.47 496.89 A: yes 

497.46 499.42 A: i'm sure the card companies would really love this 

497.76 498.01 B: so 

499.39 500.00 B: ah 

501.17 503.98 A: one more holiday for cards 

502.67 505.98 B: one more holiday to come up with a verse so well 

506.13 507.62 B: we could put um 

508.40 512.37 B: build another holiday put how many more people to work writing verses 

512.22 512.91 A: true
