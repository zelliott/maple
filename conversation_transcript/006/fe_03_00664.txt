117.85 119.38 B: war and things like that 

120.12 121.07 B: i think of our

122.68 125.41 B: town i mean i'm from woso wisconsin and 

125.53 126.13 A: oh

132.40 133.92 B: about the war you know 

134.37 135.09 B: and it just 

135.94 136.82 B: it seems like

139.90 141.04 B: white in front of the 

142.00 143.10 B: city hall going to do 

145.09 145.97 B: that all goes back 

146.07 146.35 B: to 

147.09 149.54 B: you know nine one one the few people that were 

148.49 148.83 A: mm hm

153.78 154.52 B: i don't know i 

157.79 158.15 B: our 

158.63 160.14 B: little area's going to do anything 

160.40 161.14 A: well 

161.35 163.34 A: believe it or not though i'm i'm um 

163.49 166.28 A: been watching some of this because i'm i'm extremely 

166.87 168.26 A: concerned ah 

168.42 170.19 A: you know even though my business is doing 

170.65 172.84 A: well ah there are some side 

172.94 173.92 A: effects 

174.01 177.74 A: that i'm concerned too that's that's the war which i think is separate 

178.31 179.08 A: um 

179.35 180.85 A: you know the they ah 

180.96 183.30 A: if hussein had nothing to do with the 

183.45 184.65 A: osama bin laden 

184.90 187.56 A: characters and um yet 

187.67 196.26 A: we some how seem to have gotten everything mixed together and ah i um i it seems we are being propelled into something that 

197.20 201.45 A: could be very dangerous for us but it it seems what i've seen 

201.63 204.57 A: seems as if um there are a lot of people 

205.31 206.93 A: becoming more active and 

207.07 208.28 A: the anti-war 

208.43 211.24 A: movement then then i would imagine more quickly

255.22 255.95 B: you know growth 

256.06 257.28 B: this year and 

258.01 258.98 B: it's nice to hear

279.03 279.41 B: in that 

279.59 280.14 B: state 

281.97 284.35 B: per se but we actually did um 

285.65 287.38 B: we had a few people working there 

287.63 288.08 A: um hm 

288.03 288.29 B: that 

288.42 290.64 B: you know as soon as it happened i actually thought that someone was 

291.69 293.07 B: joking when they sent that 

293.16 296.38 B: the email to me that morning showing the buildings going down i thought 

297.03 299.38 B: you know what what is this i don't understand you know 

299.21 300.21 A: yeah 

299.71 301.59 B: went over to hear and i'm like what are you doing 

301.94 302.78 B: this really happening 

303.76 307.25 A: wow the got it was it was scary i i i 

306.57 309.22 B: yeah but then later a little bit later we got a note 

307.44 307.74 A: yeah 

309.88 313.07 B: saying we had two people in there they got out of the building and 

313.14 313.56 A: oh

326.52 327.11 B: yeah 

327.78 328.13 B: yeah 

329.33 330.07 B: but i still think

332.39 334.07 B: this may be getting off a little bit but 

334.49 335.53 B: i feel um 

336.20 338.89 B: less confident in giving money to the red cross 

340.32 342.13 B: because of the way they handled the nine one one 

342.83 343.29 A: hm 

343.81 345.61 A: wow tell me about that because i 

346.05 346.96 A: i i thi- 

346.52 346.91 B: they 

347.90 350.53 B: they had money people sending in money 

350.79 351.28 A: um hm 

351.88 354.42 B: strictly for the victims of nine one one 

355.18 357.40 B: and they had such a huge excess 

357.62 358.36 B: of money 

358.96 360.24 B: they decided to 

361.34 361.70 B: keep it 

362.35 364.44 B: and use it for other disasters 

364.92 365.36 A: oh 

365.57 366.69 A: i didn't know that 

366.17 366.64 B: (( future )) 

366.82 368.64 B: yeah for future things that happened 

369.01 369.42 A: oh 

369.83 372.47 B: and these people were very upset because they gave it 

373.35 375.12 B: wanting it to go to these victims 

375.69 376.35 A: yes 

376.52 376.94 A: yeah 

376.81 380.21 B: and the red cross decided how much they were giving and that was it 

380.77 381.72 B: to these people 

382.43 382.92 B: and 

384.35 385.66 B: that was it you know 

385.92 386.70 B: they felt that was 

387.05 387.75 B: plenty and 

388.40 389.61 B: that's all they were doing 

389.66 394.69 A: wow that ah that's not their position to make that decision 

393.37 394.43 B: no 

394.87 396.05 B: no if i gave money 

396.46 398.93 B: you know i would want it to go to where i specify 

399.26 400.77 A: yes absolutely 

399.74 401.71 B: i wouldn't want it going to 

402.49 404.49 B: you know someone else or otherwise i would have given it 

405.62 407.71 B: and said here use as what you want 

407.70 408.23 A: mm hm 

409.08 410.79 B: i just i thought that was really wrong 

412.44 414.68 A: wow thank you for telling me about that 

412.66 413.12 B: but

422.10 422.72 B: like i said it 

422.90 423.16 B: it just 

423.30 425.59 B: makes think you twice about where you're going to give your money 

426.51 427.62 B: where you're going to donate 

427.78 428.48 A: yes 

428.53 429.87 B: and you shouldn't i mean

433.33 438.04 A: that's true now ah i you know all of these facets one doesn't necessarily imagine 

438.59 439.33 A: um 

441.08 442.48 A: spring up

467.92 470.57 A: well i live in chicago it's south 

470.68 475.47 A: and so i was wondering you know you were talking about it being a small town i was wondering if 

476.29 477.28 A: you feel 

477.95 479.92 A: less threatened then you might have 

480.03 481.34 A: feel if you were 

481.59 484.08 A: ah living here with me in chicago 

484.59 485.36 B: if i feel what 

485.51 487.99 A: less threatened living in a smaller town 

488.33 491.09 A: a little bit away from the main 

491.38 491.99 A: ah 

492.22 493.85 A: potential target i don't know 

494.16 494.50 B: yeah 

496.12 496.44 B: i 

496.61 499.32 B: yeah i don't think we have anything here to attract 

500.24 500.94 B: um 

502.06 503.55 B: like a bomber per se 

503.72 504.20 A: um hm 

504.86 507.37 B: so i guess yeah i don't i don't worry that 

508.31 511.20 B: that much you know none of buildings are humongous and 

511.85 513.39 B: you as far as our 

514.35 515.57 B: um 

516.27 517.55 B: held gatherings we don't 

519.97 521.81 B: would be like the football stadium 

522.14 522.64 A: mm hm 

522.55 522.94 B: and that 

523.39 524.88 B: too far away to effect us 

526.34 526.78 B: um 

527.77 528.37 B: yeah i guess 

529.97 532.36 B: i don't i don't feel that there's any harm in 

533.27 534.70 B: our schools and 

536.62 537.81 B: things like that either 

539.13 540.40 B: you know maybe i'm just too 

545.10 546.13 A: well you know 

546.52 547.39 B: but i guess i don't 

547.50 548.19 B: i don't know how to ah 

549.19 557.45 A: no but it ah make sense because ah when when i talk about the areas the people that they've caught 

557.70 559.21 A: have been heading towards 

560.06 560.66 B: right 

560.60 562.60 A: it's generally l._a.

578.00 580.70 A: that's right the miami the miami area and orlando 

578.71 579.07 B: so th- 

581.24 584.68 B: yeah she's not you know right in one of those cities but 

585.03 587.28 B: i just think of florida as as a whole and 

587.58 590.62 B: you know kind of worry for my grandmother 

590.81 591.26 A: mm hm
