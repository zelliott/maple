45.49 49.39 B: oh well they want to know about airport security and i definitely think that yeah 

49.53 51.11 B: that he has tightened it up a lot 

51.92 54.06 B: i've flown five times this past year and um 

54.61 58.54 B: i've been stopped all five times at the security check-outs 

58.49 60.67 A: uh but do you think that will actually um 

61.15 62.30 A: have any impact on 

62.69 63.76 A: stopping terrorism 

64.17 64.68 B: i do 

64.79 66.99 B: i do because they are checking shoes and everything now 

67.91 69.58 B: it is a lot harder to get on a plane 

69.90 77.15 A: that is true i mean i've had um people actually go through my carry-on and take my cosmetic bag out and like go through that too but 

77.82 79.28 A: i don't know it just seems kind of 

79.79 80.73 A: a lot of the times they just 

80.88 82.79 A: do it for the sake of doing it and 

83.11 83.83 A: not really 

84.28 85.33 A: searching for anything 

85.59 88.01 B: yeah and they they did let me see at one airport 

88.97 90.83 B: i was told i could only have two lighters 

91.53 95.48 B: and i had brought pa- a package of lighters with me and they so they took five lighters away from me 

97.85 100.59 B: but i don't know what a lighter would possibly do with terrorism 

99.06 101.87 A: that is what i'm thinking 

101.55 103.47 B: shit is like gee 

103.33 105.66 A: oh you are going to set the airplane on fire 

104.78 105.51 B: yeah yeah 

106.36 106.69 B: yup 

109.03 109.85 A: yeah um 

109.65 111.42 B: i would think that he has more than one question 

112.52 113.44 A: hm 

113.94 115.18 B: so i don't know where are you from 

115.48 116.59 A: i'm from philly 

117.29 117.83 B: from where 

117.83 118.75 A: philadelphia 

119.03 121.24 B: oh oh oh okay i'm out here in montana 

121.60 122.47 A: oh wow 

122.40 123.70 B: yeah 

124.13 126.64 A: is it as cold over there as it is here

127.09 128.39 B: no it is forty degrees here 

128.81 129.52 A: oh wow 

129.86 131.65 A: i would've thought it was it would be cold there 

131.89 132.29 B: no 

133.20 134.49 B: so are you close to an airport 

135.14 138.11 A: i'm about twenty minutes from the philadelphia international airport 

138.21 140.56 B: yeah and i'm about ten miles away from the airport here 

142.75 144.29 B: um the last time i flew was what 

144.39 146.32 B: two months ago i flew from newark here 

147.37 148.00 A: okay 

148.17 148.69 B: and um 

148.90 149.72 B: i got stopped in 

149.96 150.47 B: albany 

150.69 151.43 B: first airport 

151.56 151.95 A: mhm 

152.10 155.18 B: then i got stopped at the second airport for security my shoes again 

156.40 157.40 A: just regular shoes 

157.58 158.66 B: yeah they had uh 

159.18 161.83 B: metal they were (( sneaks )) like and they had like metal uh 

162.57 163.32 A: oh okay 

162.62 164.26 B: tie you know where your tie yup yup 

164.46 164.99 A: okay 

165.26 168.78 A: the only time they actually checked my shoes was when i was wearing knee-high boots 

165.27 165.77 B: that and 

169.12 169.61 B: ugh 

169.43 170.83 A: that i understand but 

170.77 171.25 B: yeah 

171.96 173.37 A: just regular shoes oh 

174.92 177.47 B: i don't know i i do think that it had some something 

179.06 182.25 B: i think people are a lot more cautious about what they are bringing on with them too 

182.14 185.46 A: yeah that is true but then at the same time i kind of question 

185.61 186.20 A: whether 

186.93 187.43 A: um 

187.73 191.10 A: the terrorist groups would be stupid enough to do the same thing again 

191.37 193.03 B: yeah yeah they know what they are doing 

193.18 193.90 A: right 

193.69 194.64 B: that is why they are terrorists 

196.97 197.82 A: yeah 

198.51 200.78 A: how long is this supposed to be do you know 

200.87 202.17 B: i don't know 

202.83 203.61 B: no clue 

204.16 205.92 B: someone had told me ten to fifteen minutes 

206.17 206.98 A: oh okay 

207.82 209.18 A: then do they just disconnect us 

209.38 212.09 B: i don't know what they do i'm like you this is my first time 

212.59 214.22 A: uh how did you find out about this study 

214.38 215.10 B: on the internet 

215.40 216.09 A: oh okay 

216.53 217.35 B: how did you find out 

217.55 220.26 A: oh um i go to this school so 

220.47 221.66 B: oh so you knew huh 

222.26 222.86 A: y- yeah 

223.08 224.34 B: yeah i found out on the internet 

225.66 226.13 A: oh 

227.39 229.89 A: so do you travel for business is that what you do 

229.48 230.81 B: no no i was uh 

231.84 233.22 B: i flew back and forth from 

233.33 236.22 B: new york to montana five times last year -cause i was relocating 

236.60 237.61 A: oh okay 

237.61 238.10 B: so i kept 

237.74 238.21 A: alright 

238.34 239.48 B: you know flying for 

240.06 242.60 B: friends and then finally to get a house and then finally to move 

244.26 246.15 B: but hopefully i won't have to fly now for awhile 

248.92 250.40 B: it is getting too expensive 

251.51 252.56 A: have the prices gone up 

252.82 253.48 A: recently 

253.63 257.41 B: uh well for me to fly from albany to (( )) was like six hundred and fifty 

258.07 258.62 A: wow 

258.63 259.59 B: each time yeah 

263.32 264.04 A: i don't really 

264.15 265.76 A: do a lot of flying so 

268.47 268.81 A: yeah 

269.28 271.18 B: and then i thought it was hard too because i smoke 

271.49 274.21 B: so whenever you got to an airport you had to go outside to smoke 

274.27 276.30 A: right that is a pain 

274.48 277.38 B: you have to go back through that security again 

276.93 277.55 A: mhm 

277.99 281.25 B: and wait in those lines and go go through check all over again 

281.83 282.49 A: right 

282.93 283.30 A: um 

284.07 287.30 A: one of the airports i was at recently was um at in denver 

287.44 287.83 B: uh-huh 

288.00 289.62 A: and they had the system where they just 

289.90 294.22 A: i guess they have it everywhere they randomly pick people like every however many 

294.42 295.86 B: yeah that is what they do yup yup 

295.77 300.25 A: right um and one of my friends that i was with was commenting that he gets 

300.35 301.57 A: picked every time 

302.15 303.48 A: that he goes to an airport 

304.41 307.84 A: and i've never gotten selected for the screening (( )) 

308.15 310.26 B: i think they are doing a lot of race racial thing 

310.40 311.83 A: it seems that way doesn't it 

311.15 312.68 B: with the screening which i think isn't 

312.80 313.06 B: fair 

313.66 314.24 A: right 

314.14 315.55 B: but i think i noticed that too 

316.46 319.07 B: it depends on and it seems to be males more than females 

319.23 319.86 A: yes that is 

319.97 320.50 A: true 

324.22 324.59 A: yeah 

324.90 327.71 B: i wish they would beep in and ask another question or ask us something else 

327.81 332.36 A: yeah this is um kind of awkward i guess 

332.26 332.58 B: yeah 

335.39 338.25 B: i don't know it said we can participate in up to three studies 

335.89 336.45 A: but what uh 

338.97 343.08 A: well i thought i read somewhere that you can do more um they might invite you back for more 

343.72 345.83 B: oh i just said we uh could do up to three 

345.97 346.66 A: oh okay 

347.29 348.93 A: maybe i'm thinking about something else 

352.43 353.94 B: did you watch the state of the union tonight 

354.40 356.03 A: i was kind of flipping through 

356.08 358.67 B: that is what i was doing it is a long speech speech 

358.29 359.65 A: i- yeah 

360.66 361.76 B: a long speech 

362.72 366.01 B: and the security too you know being at the airport an hour earlier 

366.54 367.25 A: right 

367.12 367.86 B: you know it is it 

369.60 375.28 B: that i didn't like so much it was bad enough you had to be there an hour before anyways and now they want you there two hours earlier 

373.41 373.98 A: mhm 

375.11 375.84 A: yeah 

376.29 376.73 A: and they're 

377.18 378.16 A: um also i 

378.41 379.35 A: don't like the fact that 

379.90 380.97 A: people um 

381.38 383.38 A: you need to have a boarding pass to get past 

383.65 384.45 A: security and in 

384.65 385.66 A: in to the terminals 

386.58 387.04 A: and 

387.38 392.32 A: it is nice to when you are coming off a flight and you have friends or family and like they are waiting for you at the gate 

390.82 394.03 B: oh i know i know and they can't be there anymore 

393.89 394.74 A: yeah 

395.49 396.53 B: and it is hard to find -em 

397.44 399.38 A: right -cause you don't know where to go 

397.99 398.69 B: i've gotten to the 

399.10 401.91 B: no i've gotten to the point where i tell everybody well i'll meet you at 

402.01 402.58 B: baggage 

402.89 405.75 B: at the baggage you know where you pick your baggage it's like that is easier 

403.61 404.35 A: yeah 

406.19 408.19 B: place to meet some of those airports are so big 

408.53 409.16 A: yeah 

411.38 414.15 B: but um i haven't seen them taking anybody's uh luggage 

414.81 416.23 B: that is going on-board 

416.58 417.00 B: in fact 

417.55 418.41 B: when i came out 

419.49 422.68 B: ugh this was my first time coming out in april of last year 

422.72 423.12 A: mhm 

423.19 428.02 B: my son is out here and he left a chain saw back in new york and everybody said to me you are never going to get a chain saw on the plane 

428.10 428.91 A: did you get it on 

428.96 430.53 B: yeah they never asked any questions 

431.18 431.95 A: wow 

432.67 434.07 A: that is surprising 

435.03 438.15 A: so they take a lighter but they let you carry on a chain saw 

437.66 440.19 B: well no i didn't carry the chain saw on i mean i did um 

439.87 440.81 A: oh yeah 

440.44 441.01 B: b- book it 

441.28 442.46 B: but it did get on the plane 

443.18 443.83 A: wow 

443.93 444.53 B: which everybody 

452.41 453.34 B: and that surprised me 

454.75 456.64 A: yeah that is very surprising 

464.10 464.42 A: um 

465.36 467.21 B: do you have a clock do you know how long we've been on here yet 

467.26 468.75 A: i don't know how long we've been on 

468.86 469.26 A: maybe 

470.12 472.61 A: a little over five ten around ten minutes maybe 

472.75 474.02 B: i would think so by now 

474.15 474.69 A: yeah 

477.23 478.62 A: i wonder if they'll disconnect us 

478.94 479.34 A: or 

479.45 482.25 B: well they called me about an hour ago but i didn't have my pin written down 

482.42 483.84 A: oh me too 

483.67 484.50 B: j- ugh 

485.61 491.95 B: so then i click in to get back on the internet and look up my pin number and i wrote it down i was like it will probably not call again tonight 

492.09 493.16 A: yeah 

492.96 493.58 B: but they did 

497.64 498.76 B: so you don't fly too much 

499.33 499.67 A: um 

500.66 503.46 A: i fly a- about two or three times a year 

503.74 504.01 B: yeah 

504.14 504.90 A: and 

506.63 507.38 A: uh like 

507.83 510.10 A: i guess one or two of them are local and then 

510.34 511.85 A: not local domestic and then 

512.48 513.99 A: once out of this country 

514.27 516.02 B: oh is it harder flying out of the country 

517.46 520.36 A: i didn't really notice that much of a difference in security 

520.37 520.77 B: no 

520.95 521.60 A: yeah 

521.85 523.71 A: um the only thing i actually noticed was that 

523.95 524.39 A: um 

525.72 526.08 A: uh 

526.67 526.98 A: well 

527.33 529.62 A: i carry um you know those cosmetic scissors 

529.99 530.61 B: right right 

530.81 531.54 A: but um 

531.83 538.62 A: on domestic flights they just kind of um look at it and tell me that like warn me or something but they let me carry it on 

536.75 537.01 B: yeah 

538.71 542.62 A: but and the international flight they actually took it from me and that is pretty much it 

542.93 543.71 B: oh they did take -em 

543.94 545.11 A: yeah they did take it 

550.57 552.41 B: but that is good in a way though huh huh 

553.03 553.81 B: i guess flying 

554.08 554.79 B: overseas 

556.05 556.78 A: yeah 

560.53 562.80 B: i wonder if they come back in and tell us you know okay
