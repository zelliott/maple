14.07 16.29 B: run-ins with the airport security 

16.83 18.14 A: no um 

18.53 19.48 A: but i do think 

19.59 21.75 A: that the increased security has helped a lot 

22.64 23.80 B: yes i agree 

24.29 25.68 B: um i feel safer 

24.40 24.82 A: um 

25.84 26.32 A: yeah 

26.43 27.85 A: yeah and i feel that they can 

28.00 29.88 A: you know wait out some of the bad stuff 

30.35 30.89 B: right 

32.07 32.49 B: um 

33.19 36.13 A: but it has slowed things down you know checking in and 

36.19 43.54 B: it has slowed things down and it is also a little bit of an inconvenience um they have you take off your shoes and things now 

44.22 45.80 A: yeah but it is worth it you know 

45.40 47.08 B: oh it is i i do agree 

45.96 49.30 A: yeah i would rather do that than go in to a building 

48.67 51.55 B: right no i i do agree that it is worth it 

53.83 55.97 B: i- it makes me feel better about flying 

56.41 57.87 A: yeah it does me too i mean 

58.62 61.28 A: i haven't flown but a couple of times but 

61.60 67.70 A: the times i had i was always a little bit nervous but i feel that you know doing that would make me a little bit easier 

67.94 68.36 B: yeah 

69.36 71.69 B: i i actually fly pretty often 

71.69 72.19 A: yeah 

72.20 72.65 B: um 

73.13 75.05 B: and you know you have to get to the airport 

75.37 76.18 B: uh two hours 

76.50 77.36 B: early now 

77.41 77.94 A: yeah 

77.52 78.24 B: um 

78.39 79.89 B: allow extra time for that 

82.30 83.93 A: for the baggage check-in and 

84.39 85.23 B: yeah 

84.50 85.83 A: the security and 

86.00 86.61 B: yeah 

87.01 90.18 B: and you know there are times where i can tell that my bags have been 

90.65 94.86 B: um searched you know like when i've checked them i can tell that they have been looked through 

94.70 95.11 A: yeah 

95.15 95.49 B: and 

95.60 97.92 B: you know i i i do feel that it's 

98.80 101.10 B: it is a little bit of an inconvenience but 

102.45 106.22 A: well i i just wish they had it done that before the tragedy happened 

106.16 107.43 B: oh i no it they 

107.11 108.34 A: you know it i mean they 

107.74 109.41 B: they could have done something about it 

108.74 110.22 A: they got to where they had curb check- 

110.46 112.21 A: curb-side check in and 

113.15 114.67 A: and i don't think they do that now 

114.96 115.47 B: yeah 

116.54 116.95 B: um 

117.40 119.07 B: it it would have been nice if they could have 

119.23 119.67 B: caught 

120.32 122.29 A: yeah it would'v- it would have really been 

123.57 125.06 A: you know better off for everyone 

126.86 128.51 B: and i definitely know that they find the 

128.78 135.24 B: they find things now i've had a lot of items confiscated that i didn't think were were a threat at all like a like a button 

131.94 132.37 A: yeah 

134.77 135.62 A: oh really 

135.39 137.24 B: a bike lock for example 

137.35 137.74 A: hm 

137.37 137.83 B: um 

138.24 139.54 B: you know it's just this 

139.88 146.05 B: it's just a met- a piece of metal in a shape of an u. to lock your bike up and they took it from me i was 

146.59 150.80 B: a little disappointed but i guess i guess i understand that it's a heavy object 

150.93 151.82 B: that you could 

152.24 153.35 B: you could poke an eye out with 

153.37 153.81 A: yeah 

153.67 154.75 B: or clobber somebody 

154.04 156.14 A: well my friend she went to london 

156.26 156.58 B: yeah 

156.82 157.27 A: uh 

157.69 158.36 A: see it was back 

159.30 160.36 A: last um 

160.61 161.62 A: march i believe it was 

162.12 164.80 A: she had a pair of fingernail clippers and a file and they 

165.02 166.85 A: took them from her i mean they wouldn't let her 

167.55 168.12 A: get in the 

168.45 168.83 A: plane 

169.12 169.71 B: yeah 

170.13 173.00 B: fingernail clippers you know i mean what what could 

173.31 175.86 B: what could you how much damage could you do with that 

175.88 178.40 A: i know i mean that that is what i was wondering i mean 

179.60 180.73 A: she even said they was caught 

180.90 182.82 A: getting lighters from people and 

183.66 185.69 A: some hair brushes that had metal in -em in 

185.79 186.56 A: stuff like that 

187.66 188.14 B: wow 

188.28 190.25 A: i guess anything can be viewed as a weapon 

192.93 193.47 B: yeah 

197.78 198.95 B: you have to wear um 

200.71 203.34 B: the appropriate clothing to um 

204.66 211.06 B: i've had to remove my belt and my shoes and it's i feel like i'm disrobing at the security check-point 

210.91 212.28 A: yeah and i've seen something on the 

212.59 214.23 A: television news the other day 

214.91 215.33 A: that 

215.73 216.19 A: um 

216.59 219.13 A: there is some kind of shoes now i believe nike was making them 

219.26 219.58 B: yeah 

219.58 221.46 A: that has metal in the bottom of them and 

221.56 222.25 A: sometimes 

222.71 224.28 A: when you go through the the um 

224.43 224.92 A: scanner 

225.23 228.62 A: it was going off and they are telling people if they have them shoes not to wear -em 

228.87 230.29 A: if they are going to go to the airport 

230.50 231.10 B: yeah 

230.91 231.42 A: save a lot of 

231.66 233.21 A: problems with having to take them off 

233.51 235.15 A: because i believe they was confiscating 

236.60 238.29 B: they would take away the shoes 

238.09 240.46 A: yes -cause they had metal in the soles of them 

240.69 241.27 B: yeah 

240.80 243.58 A: and they said if it was removed it was like a razor or something 

244.13 245.03 B: oh wow 

244.75 245.15 A: i guess 

245.62 246.08 A: you know 

245.80 250.74 B: i i have to say i would be pretty disappointed if i had to leave my shoes behind 

246.23 246.66 A: people 

248.85 250.22 A: yeah i mean 

250.33 254.23 A: that is the reason they was telling people not to wear -em -cause otherwise you would have to be barefooted you know and 

254.66 255.96 A: -cause they would confiscate -em 

257.34 258.80 A: i i was shocked about that 

260.00 260.32 A: so i (( wouldn't )) 

262.20 265.01 B: yeah all the 

265.69 268.18 B: the the walking around with no shoes would not be 

269.54 269.94 A: yeah 

270.76 271.67 B: um i once 

271.86 272.20 B: bought 

272.47 275.78 B: a a christmas present um it was actually the same year 

276.20 278.23 B: so right after september eleventh um 

278.13 278.71 A: oh really 

278.63 280.81 B: and it i i was bringing a christmas present 

280.91 283.20 B: on the plane and it was a leatherman 

283.39 288.26 B: and i could totally understand -cause leathermans have knives in them and everything 

288.04 288.40 A: yeah 

288.37 289.91 B: um so i could totally understand 

290.13 290.55 B: them 

290.17 291.59 A: did they confiscate it or 

291.28 298.07 B: wanting well uh luckily i had time because it was brand new i mean and leathermans are not cheap um 

298.37 298.74 B: and 

299.17 302.50 B: so i didn't want them to confiscate it and luckily i had enough time 

302.70 305.34 B: to go back and put it in 

305.61 313.17 B: checked baggage and then it was fine um it was fine to send it in checked baggage i just couldn't carry it on but 

306.74 307.06 A: yeah 

312.70 313.04 A: yeah 

313.33 316.08 B: you know they were unwrapping my packages like i had 

316.33 316.70 B: you know 

316.86 317.78 B: wrapped presents 

318.44 321.45 B: in nice wrapping paper and they were taking them apart and 

321.06 322.52 A: oh my gosh huh 

321.82 324.67 B: what a you know it was just awful 

324.90 328.18 A: well did they give if they confiscate something do they give it back or do they 

328.37 329.97 B: no they um 

330.22 331.68 B: they they'll take it and keep it 

332.86 333.24 B: um 

332.97 335.94 A: i forgot to ask my friend about that because i forgot -cause 

337.16 341.56 A: you know i didn't even think about it this time whether they gave her her stuff back but i guess they don't 

341.72 344.56 B: no uh uh you have options like you can 

345.19 345.86 B: you can have it 

346.00 347.80 B: you know shipped home you know you can 

347.94 349.08 B: you can leave the line and 

349.17 352.65 B: and have give it to somebody or put it in your checked baggage and 

353.13 354.89 B: if you have time for that kind of thing but 

355.04 355.58 B: sometimes 

356.17 357.51 B: you know i haven't had time 

358.04 360.51 B: and i have to get you know catch my plane 

360.45 360.84 A: yeah 

361.03 363.03 B: so i end up losing things 

362.71 367.50 A: yeah by the time you get through all the check points and things probably then the plane is probably done loading and 

368.05 368.69 B: yeah 

369.02 369.45 B: yeah 

372.07 373.15 B: and they used to 

373.74 375.61 B: do another security check once 

375.88 376.35 B: um 

376.75 378.04 B: you are about to board the plane 

378.17 378.54 A: uh-huh 

378.85 379.34 B: um 

380.01 386.04 B: and yeah they would call you y- you would be about to get on the plane and they will call you aside and and check you one more time 

385.73 386.43 A: oh really 

386.40 388.86 B: yeah i don't think they do that anymore 

389.22 390.61 B: but they did at first 

390.95 394.57 A: yeah y- and you know i was reading somewhere i believe it was in reader's digest 

394.81 395.13 B: yeah 

395.19 396.69 A: that they they that them people 

397.07 398.10 A: boarding that plane 

398.62 400.79 A: (( )) had some kind of security system that matched 

400.89 401.43 A: their face 

401.59 402.47 A: to terrorists 

403.12 405.34 A: and they were supposed to have caught them too 

405.79 408.44 A: but they let -em go on through without even stopping -em 

408.61 409.66 B: oh you are kidding 

409.43 412.11 A: yeah and they said if they would have just done their job that day 

412.15 412.56 B: yeah 

412.60 413.36 A: something about the 

413.50 414.13 A: the face 

414.26 416.99 A: that the camera took the face picture and it cross referenced 

417.10 418.28 A: w- with known terrorists 

418.51 419.81 B: oh no 

419.12 420.62 A: and it and it sent a red 

420.72 421.12 A: flag 

422.14 423.23 A: thought them to but they did 

423.45 424.49 B: but they didn't 

424.18 425.91 A: no and that is what ended up happening 

426.00 427.05 B: oh my goodness 

427.73 428.23 B: you know 

428.70 430.33 B: i think that back then like 

430.78 433.06 B: no one ever thought anything would ever happen 

433.25 433.62 A: yeah 

433.89 435.27 B: and you know -cause our planes 

435.44 436.79 B: i- uh they were so safe 

437.66 440.47 B: and so i think maybe that is why the employees just 

440.63 441.09 B: slacked 

441.58 445.56 A: yeah that is probably what it was and they thought well you know that it wouldn't happen and then it did and 

446.85 448.74 A: but you can't go back and change the past 

453.95 455.12 B: i mean even um 

455.69 456.90 B: after they started 

457.54 459.72 B: beefing up the security a little that um 

460.12 462.66 B: that guy with the that guy that was going to um 

463.01 464.15 B: ignite his shoes 

464.26 464.65 A: uh-huh 

464.80 465.69 B: yeah he got on 

468.20 469.60 A: and what did they ever do with him 

470.01 470.52 B: um 

471.32 475.16 B: he they they subdued him when he was on the plane so he didn't do any damage 

475.57 475.90 B: um 

477.02 479.26 B: but the stewardess had something to subdue him 

479.77 480.30 B: and 

480.55 482.13 B: then i don't know he was on 

482.25 484.20 B: trial i don't know know whatever happened 

484.61 485.23 B: in the end 

485.17 488.96 A: well i remember hearing about it but i don't remember what actually if if he went to jail or 

490.71 491.23 B: um 

491.62 492.46 B: yeah i 

492.56 495.27 B: i don't know the outcome of that i know they had like a 

495.65 499.02 B: a dateline special on it or something like that um 

499.24 500.91 B: where they they told the story but 

501.56 502.01 B: i 

502.25 503.52 B: i'd i'm not sure of what 

503.42 505.29 A: and every time a plane crashed i think it 

505.49 507.46 A: you know people first thing people think is 

507.86 509.21 A: is it terrorist related 

509.29 510.41 B: oh i know i've 

509.56 513.15 A: you know -cause one just crashed here in charlotte north carolina -cause i'm from north carolina 

513.22 514.05 B: oh okay 

513.98 514.44 A: and 

514.65 518.50 A: one crashed in n- charlotte i don't know if you've heard about it it was like a couple of weeks back 

519.36 520.41 A: it was at (( )) 

519.48 519.86 B: um 

520.75 522.73 B: i think i did here about that but uh 

523.10 523.87 B: but i just it 

524.04 526.27 B: you know came up one day and then it was dropped the next 

524.22 524.76 A: well they (( )) 

526.38 528.94 A: yeah well we heard a lot about it because it was in our state but 

528.65 529.07 B: right 

529.17 529.46 B: right 

529.36 530.97 A: but now they told us (( )) 

531.06 536.09 A: that some airlines is going to start weighing people and weighing the luggage because they believe that weight 

536.43 542.06 A: had an issue in that plane crashing but the first thing after it happened i remember every one was asking on the news 

542.38 543.16 A: was this terrorist 

543.53 544.55 A: related in a- a- 

544.72 545.57 A: in anyway 

545.64 546.23 B: yeah 

545.89 546.97 A: and they said they didn't think 

547.61 549.26 B: yeah i'm i'm not surprised 

549.38 554.72 B: that they would ask that um that's funny that you say that about the weight because i just got a 

555.03 556.13 B: an email from 

556.62 559.72 B: united saying that they were going to start charging people 

557.42 557.77 A: uh-huh 

560.70 561.53 B: for um 

562.90 565.24 B: checked baggage that was over fifty pounds
