10.43 13.29 A: okay well what's your favorite holiday 

12.99 16.87 B: [sigh] well i think my favorite holiday is probably thanksgiving 

16.71 18.04 A: thanksgiving 

17.44 19.03 B: yeah how about you 

18.45 26.20 A: oh i think i like christmas just because of the decorations not because it you know it's all special but j- i like the house decorated [laughter] 

21.44 22.46 B: uh-huh 

25.36 34.30 B: yeah [sigh] yeah that is nice too [sigh] i don't know i guess thanksgiving because um [lipsmack] i like to cook and that's the tradition 

34.45 41.63 B: turkey with all the trimmings and everything so [sigh] and to me it's a lot less stressful than christmas time 

35.14 36.39 A: turkey yeah 

41.34 46.01 A: ah yeah the they they you know you've got to be right on that it really is 

41.92 43.39 B: you know even 

45.38 47.63 B: yeah and i love the dec- 

46.82 56.52 A: your biggest worry is just getting the turkey done [laughter] and it being juicy [sigh] christmas you don't need to get everybody to just get what they like blah blah blah [laughter] yeah [sigh] 

49.48 52.32 B: [laughter] [laughter] exactly 

54.59 67.08 B: mhm yeah [sigh] and um [lipsmack] i love the decorations and the lights and everything of that sort and i love to decorate the house but i do find christmas to be [sigh] very stressful and i haven't um 

67.32 72.09 B: found my way around that yet i haven't figured that out over all these years 

70.82 82.76 A: yeah yeah yeah it does get stressful by the time it's all over you've just glad and you want to get the decorations down and out [sigh] and just relax a little while and get it done with [sigh] 

72.88 74.02 B: uh-huh 

76.48 77.59 B: oh 

78.05 79.96 B: yes yes 

82.12 89.96 B: yeah i know it and i think y- you know all through christmas i think i've got to take these decorations down and repack them and restore them 

89.99 97.85 B: [lipsmack] in the basement room and it's like [lipsmack] oh there's the most horrible job ahead of me so [sigh] yeah i think that's part of it too 

94.63 95.54 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

97.36 98.34 A: yeah 

98.39 108.95 A: [mn] taking them down i think is worse than putting them up i mean you know before christmas you know the month before or whatever when you decide to put 'em up you know the stress isn't really there [laughter] 

101.29 102.75 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

105.26 107.14 B: mhm oh it's new it 

107.61 120.98 B: yeah it's new and exciting at that point you know you haven't done it for a year so it's [sigh] you know it's fresh it's something different and you can get into it but by the time it's over with it's like oh i've had a whole month on this and [sigh] i don't want to 

119.54 124.61 A: yeah you've sick of it and now you've got to touch 'em again [laughter] and put 'em away [laughter] 

120.83 123.54 B: mhm [laughter] i know [sigh] 

124.33 129.07 B: i know and make and [sigh] then you have to get 'em packed back into that [lipsmack] 

129.51 132.27 B: um box [sigh] and like 

132.44 139.11 B: they never fit back like you took them out you know [laughter] [sigh] exactly so [sigh] 

134.89 136.35 A: [laughter] this is true 

136.40 137.60 A: this is true 

137.99 141.30 A: so if you had to create one what would you create 

141.20 142.33 B: (( oh )) 

143.15 144.26 B: well 

145.42 148.38 A: and i didn't have an answer for it this morning so 

147.83 154.67 B: yeah i don't know i haven't i have really never ever considered that there's so many holidays i thought mm 

148.61 149.87 A: [laughter] 

154.82 156.95 B: one more what would i do with one more 

154.87 159.41 A: yeah it seems like there just would be there's just one for everything almost 

159.04 160.21 B: i know i 

159.51 165.41 A: well the guy this morning that i talked to in georgia said if he had he would create singles day 

165.20 176.50 A: because his holidays all all the holidays are basically for families but none just for single people [laughter] and i was like hey that's pretty good one off the top of your head 

168.67 170.22 B: families yeah 

171.90 175.15 B: right [laughter] [sigh] well that's a good 

175.79 189.44 B: really that's a good point that would be a good point and [sigh] and i know [mn] i have a single daughter who's in her early thirties and um [lipsmack] she does a lot of holidays and a lot of things like that [mn] from time to time with her 

189.31 191.31 B: circle of single friends 

191.17 192.04 A: (( mm )) 

192.02 196.79 B: [lipsmack] and so i could see where that would that might work out 

196.46 209.31 A: yeah i just can't think of another holiday that i would want i would want th- the another legal holiday i think september the eleventh should be [sigh] a legal holiday but as far as a celebrating holiday 

209.38 211.85 A: [sigh] i just can't think 

209.58 210.58 B: [lipsmack] y- 

211.40 215.06 B: i'd i could i'm [mn] with you i don't think an- 

216.29 219.52 B: and we've got so many th- and 

219.16 224.61 A: [sigh] but i think m- you know as long as it's another day off work what difference does it make [laughter] 

222.77 227.84 B: yeah [laughter] [laughter] well i don't have to worry about that any more so [laughter] 

225.47 229.02 A: we'll create ten of them just to get the days off work huh [sigh] 

228.23 237.19 B: [laughter] exactly so holidays to me are you know kinda like another day only [sigh] you cook something different or whatever but [sigh] um yeah it's um 

229.11 230.00 A: (( [sigh] )) 

237.92 244.48 B: [lipsmack] yeah and sometimes i think people you know they have to celebrate absolutely everything so [sigh] 

244.52 247.54 B: and th- then you think about the consumer 

248.09 252.45 B: consumerization of everything you know it it just gets to the point where 

252.49 254.89 B: people drive themselves crazy 

255.29 259.87 B: feeling that they have to celebrate every little thing 

257.26 259.10 A: yeah yeah 

260.22 267.48 B: and i think it creates y- you know so much added stress to people's already stressful lives 

263.30 264.51 A: more stress 

267.23 268.29 A: yep 

268.34 271.83 B: so i'm for leaving everything as they are [laughter] 

270.91 272.99 A: [sigh] [sigh] yeah that works too [sigh] 

272.31 273.68 B: yeah 

273.44 274.55 A: okay 

274.26 275.07 B: so 

275.48 279.50 A: [sigh] i don't know are we supposed to stay online till it comes back on or what [mn] 

275.67 276.66 B: (( and we're )) 

278.84 288.52 B: i like i say i've never done this before so [sigh] i've i assume that they'll let us know when it what do we have fifteen minutes or something like that to do this 

280.49 282.75 A: [sigh] oh that's right okay 

286.89 294.57 A: oh i don't know the other two the both of the other ones that i did was about [laughter] five minutes i mean you can only talk about [sigh] a subject y-

469.92 471.50 B: exactly

479.20 480.65 A: (( ah [sigh] )) 

479.65 487.93 B: because he had signed up and they had called him [sigh] a time or two but [mn] and left a brief message but i think he was on the computer at the time 

488.41 490.94 B: or some the phone was busy anyway um 

491.10 499.12 B: [sigh] so then he signed me up and then things came in my name so i don't know if they just switch from him to me now

528.30 541.81 A: yeah it was very short so you know there was nothing left to talk about i've only [mn] i've seen an ad [lipsmack] you know [sigh] in passing so you know i don't even know what's [mn] even out there any more [sigh] but some of them are just gross 

529.80 531.10 B: [laughter]

571.15 573.14 A: yeah [sigh] so 

572.32 576.89 B: but there's got to be a better way of making a buck than doing stuff like that 

574.56 580.99 A: yeah you know like i said anybody will do anything for a buck but you know that's going too far [laughter] 

579.60 581.03 B: really [laughter]
