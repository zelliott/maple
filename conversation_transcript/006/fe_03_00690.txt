0.87 3.07 A: hello i'm cherie foster 

2.81 7.70 B: hello oh yes my name is vincent brown hi how you doing how you doing 

5.18 6.30 A: hi vincent 

7.97 11.68 B: okay um well we're supposed to talk about the airport security 

11.07 16.71 A: yeah yeah oh i guess and do we think that it uh heightens the uh 

17.42 19.47 A: security in the air or 

18.91 26.22 B: [mn] well i think it's good you can't say it's bad but then again it has its negative too [laughter] 

25.04 25.88 A: [laughter] 

26.08 31.34 A: yeah i guess if you the if you're the passenger having to wait in line [laughter] 

29.09 39.62 B: oh yes yes ah it um you know um i know what you mean it's just it's it's making our way of life a little difficult but ah 

38.56 42.00 A: well i'm a little biased i guess because i work at an airport 

41.62 42.78 B: (( ah ha )) 

42.18 55.79 A: and although i don't have anything to do with the security end of it i work in administration um i can see the real pluses for it in the particular airport i work at seems to have done a pretty good job of um changing things 

53.81 54.97 B: right 

55.69 59.33 B: oh so you say you are okay what do you mean by you're biased you see 

59.50 61.17 B: you see mostly plus 

61.22 68.12 A: yes oh yeah absolutely it's hard not to be a little biased because i work for the airport but ah 

63.10 63.99 B: yeah 

68.22 76.40 A: but the way that we handled things at the airport we seemed to have gotten lines down gotten lines pretty short and get people through uh pretty well 

74.97 82.42 B: yeah right no i i see although don't get me wrong after nine eleven there's no doubt about it that we need security okay 

81.99 83.01 A: mhm 

82.57 90.29 B: you know and as i said i'm also proud of my in other words if you said to me take it away go back to your way i say no 

89.93 97.68 A: yeah well now have you had to fly since then i i've not flown so i have not had any personal experience 

90.61 91.57 B: [laughter] 

95.35 96.43 B: (( [laughter] )) 

96.93 100.69 B: i have not flown but i have taken him to the airport 

100.12 100.90 A: yes 

101.00 108.40 B: and taking someone to the airport and waiting sometimes just as [laughter] easy [lipsmack] it gives you a certain sense of um 

108.92 116.85 B: you get the feeling about what they have to go through because you know you have to wait for them until they get on the you know they get on the plane so you see all the security and what they have to go through 

116.47 117.82 A: mhm 

117.66 121.45 B: (( but uh i i like i said i've no problem with a negative )) 

122.15 123.87 B: (( [lipsmack] but ah [mn] )) 

123.27 137.78 A: well our airport the the uh the meeters and greeters cannot go airside any more so you can't actually meet passengers off of the airplane so that's kind of a negative in some ways but uh 

136.62 137.62 B: (( oh oh )) 

137.70 140.13 B: oh you mean what you are saying is that um 

140.88 143.76 B: to get in the airport and to get in a plane you have to go through 

144.24 148.20 B: a you know just like you know when you used to meet them coming off the plane right there 

147.35 153.26 A: well you have to go you can't go in fact you can't go through a checkpoint if you don't have a ticket 

153.20 155.09 B: right exactly 

153.39 154.84 A: so yeah 

155.08 158.92 B: exactly right right right be a certain distance away 

158.89 173.39 B: and now they are talking about uh the amount of luggage that you can carry on what kind you can carry on you have to leave your bag open um i was reading something about leaving the bags open access to uh security if they need to go through the bags 

173.50 176.73 B: and i couldn't figure out fully understand that you know what i mean [mn] 

176.56 187.68 A: well in in not having the personal experience myself i but i do have a daughter that flew over the holidays and they were searched a couple of times but her husband uh is originally from another country 

187.72 199.44 A: not a middle east country or anything like that he's from yeah from iceland but she felt like they kind of picked on him because he was from another country even though he's a citizen so 

190.57 191.67 B: right right 

192.46 193.55 B: mhm 

196.88 197.93 B: [laughter] 

199.28 200.51 B: (( right right yeah )) 

200.82 205.70 A: but but i you know all in all i think that um 

206.18 218.22 A: i think that we've done a good job i think that the airline industry as a rule has done a real good job as far as security goes and i can't help but think it's got to have some impact 

218.33 229.53 B: it does and also i think that okay my view is too also that the government may have to okay the cost when i look at the cost factor too okay 'cause i'm you know in economics and figures in my 

226.69 227.64 A: mhm 

229.56 233.97 B: (( head and this is tremendous cost factor added to the airport uh )) 

234.13 235.24 B: (( you know what i mean )) 

234.91 243.05 A: well that's correct and i just watching the changes in our budget and stuff this year [laughter] i can see the difference it's making 

236.79 238.05 B: [laughter] 

239.59 241.29 B: yes i 

242.90 252.56 B: yeah because i'm in new york and i'm ah as a matter of fact very close to ground zero and i when i look at the airline i say gee that's such a tremendous cost to them i don't know if 

251.61 252.61 A: mhm 

252.99 254.74 B: whether they should be um 

254.85 260.20 B: subsidized by government because there is a certain amount of cost for security or because let's face it um 

260.42 266.48 B: you know you have a railroad too that's going to be a i don't know but it might be the next to be attacked but anyhow i'm saying that they 

266.71 272.35 B: all the these these security that is going to be in demand by the federal government right 

272.06 272.97 A: mhm 

272.36 281.43 B: uh it's a tremendous and i may be wrong the airline industry worked out security too but if they had to put all these costs on to your 

281.59 286.88 B: ticket [laughter] i guess it's gonna either hurt the budget in terms of making a 

286.97 290.79 B: negative profit or either just increase the price of tickets tremendously 

290.48 292.14 A: (( well in )) 

292.41 297.31 A: the industry itself is hurting because of a lot of that anyway already 

295.74 296.50 B: (( you )) 

297.14 311.01 B: don't have to tell me that i know it [laughter] people ah people are thinking twice about flying you know i mean if i gotta go here to if i just go next door or something i'd just take a train you know i train now but you're right go ahead go ahead i certainly 

298.49 300.92 A: [laughter] 

301.21 303.94 A: [laughter] oh absolutely yeah 

310.48 324.11 A: yeah i'm in dallas and i wish we had more public transportation uh you know i really do i wish we had more public transportation here but there are what i've been reading and what my experience has been too there's more people renting cars 

312.09 313.47 B: [laughter] 

324.06 333.78 A: and driving if they don't have more than a few hours to go whereas they used to get on a plane now whether that has to do with security or cost or what it's probably a combination 

328.59 330.33 B: (( yeah ex- [laughter] )) 

331.91 340.74 B: [laughter] it is a combination like you say it is a combination of definitely thinking about have that uh you know 

340.78 344.28 B: flying fear fear of flying now because of what's going to happen you know 

344.55 358.17 B: um so there is like i said a combination of factor uh why people are considering not flying now and but as you say there are still a lot of people not flying out as before and i think that nine eleven of course had something to do with it tremendously uh 

356.11 357.10 A: yeah 

357.23 371.81 A: well my daughter said she felt safer in the air this year yeah and when she came in for christmas she said she felt safe which that to me is good you know even if she complained a little bit about some of the stuff she had to go through she did feel safe 

361.05 361.90 B: (( uh-huh she )) 

371.32 377.17 B: did feel safe yeah well that's good that's good that she felt safe because uh you know um 

372.30 373.16 A: uh-huh 

377.88 389.68 B: before the only fear we had of flying before was if something went mechanical or otherwise happened to the plane and now we have this factor of what you say and uh [laughter] basically about terrorism when you see certain people that you try to 

389.81 391.61 B: stereotype or you try to 

391.62 399.14 B: like they say uh profile them [laughter] because of the situation you know and i had some friends of mine from um 

394.38 395.33 A: right 

399.16 403.12 B: and even right there in texas i was stationed in san antonio texas when i was in the air force 

402.79 403.87 A: (( uh-hum )) 

403.27 408.85 B: and you have many mexican american descendants and they could look very well like a mid- middle eastern 

408.37 409.36 A: mhm 

409.09 419.22 B: and um i have friends from central america that look like middle eastern and um sometimes you know like i said again people look at them kinda funny [laughter] 

418.38 424.77 A: well a lot of people are in a lot of fear and i guess that's a tendency that people have you know and i can 

424.58 438.04 A: i really i've really felt for anyone who looked of middle eastern descent you know that had to deal with that 'cause that's a shame you know that to have to deal with that but [sigh] you know i mean our skies 

429.39 430.39 B: [laughter] 

438.16 444.15 A: should be safer considering you know the wake up call that we got and everything that's been changed 

442.13 444.83 B: oh yes oh yeah oh yes 

444.88 455.22 B: like i say i'm in favor don't get me wrong in security too because i tell people you know like realistically no one thought you could just take a plane and use a plane as a bomb you know or use it as a missile you know what i mean 

447.16 448.05 A: yeah 

452.98 453.91 A: mhm 

455.08 466.43 A: well i just can't understand why nobody thought of that before you know i i feel like airport security was so lax and i didn't you know i didn't know it of course i didn't have anything to do with that end of it either but 

458.24 458.99 B: (( [mn] )) 

466.28 472.48 B: well you know it's just like um you could not think about it 'cause it is just something that was beyond your thinking 

472.75 477.65 B: okay during world war i._i. we had what was called the japanese what they call it kamikaze 

477.21 478.28 A: mhm 

477.68 479.26 B: [laughter] where 

478.64 482.73 A: well that's in essence what they did just like the kamikazes yeah 

481.90 485.56 B: when you run out of bullets or whatever you just use a plane and you go straight into the ah 

485.89 489.28 B: ship right you use the plane itself as your 

489.62 501.17 B: weapon and uh you know we just didn't think of it today in those terms that the person in the plane is going to commit suicide is going to use it to come and you know blow themselves up and ah 

501.17 504.12 A: what's hard to fathom is that anybody would think that way 

504.12 514.76 B: it is hard to but you see when you have i don't know ah i see certain things another way to it um i'm not gonna talk about in general but you know 

515.00 523.20 B: people first of all if you were a humanitarian you'd say well why would someone want to do that that's a big question you should ask yourself so we are all born 

523.38 532.36 B: blank whatever from childhood and why would someone if you've been brainwashed if you've been whatever but the reason why i mean ah 

532.68 536.71 B: i'm not in favor of those people i think are negative about they doing things wrong 

536.67 550.62 B: but we also have to look for the cause too and i think that's the biggest thing to look into why are they doing these things and has something been done to them or something what purpose it could be it could not be just for greed or just for craziness itself to want to kill yourself 

550.03 551.58 A: right right 

550.92 552.68 B: [laughter] 

551.74 558.18 A: yeah that's i'm in a sociology class right now and uh we're talking about different things and how you 

555.74 556.76 B: ooh 

558.35 560.69 B: well you must have a lot good 

560.16 575.01 A: [laughter] it's very interesting it's very interesting right now and we haven't talked a lot about terrorism or anything like that but i'm getting a whole different point of view of a lot of things by being in this class and 

560.71 561.77 B: go ahead [mn] 

568.39 569.46 B: (( well )) 

574.90 585.31 A: and you know culture is interesting anyway any culture but you know we all we're all used to what we live in and anything that's out of the norm um [laughter] 

585.84 591.48 A: it's hard to accept you know because we've grown up with a certain thing 

592.07 598.85 B: (( let me tell you a story we lived in in america we accept a lot more than many other countries in the world and many other cultures )) 

597.01 597.95 A: yeah 

598.65 599.79 A: mhm 

599.06 599.95 B: you follow what i mean
