88.68 90.92 A: it is it really is 

94.21 97.35 A: the first thing that comes to mind is honesty i guess 

97.02 97.92 B: oh 

98.85 101.96 B: yeah well i guess it depends probably on the age 

102.04 103.33 B: because 

102.35 103.72 A: yeah that's true 

103.45 105.44 B: i mean i'm

115.98 117.99 B: [noise] yeah is it different 

118.41 119.48 B: i guess 

120.13 126.77 B: [mn] so i think it's kinda well honesty's important thing too of course 

127.13 127.93 B: but 

127.96 130.10 B: kinda need you know 

130.25 131.12 B: (( some )) 

131.37 133.78 B: time to play and stuff [laughter] 

132.05 132.62 A: (( [noise] )) 

133.40 134.41 A: (( mhm )) 

134.18 135.49 B: and um 

136.06 142.42 B: so romantic relationships so it's like [mn] that's where attention comes from i mean 

142.49 143.38 A: okay 

143.49 149.12 B: so uh is it is it the first time you're on the on the phone like that 

150.58 153.44 A: yes the first time i've talked about a topic 

151.04 151.93 B: yeah 

153.21 157.69 B: no well in general yeah about something because i don't know how it goes in general 

157.68 170.75 A: i don't either because they've been trying to call but their automated system doesn't work very well and i i pick up the phone and there's nothing for a long time and [laughter] usually that means a [laughter] telemarketing call 

158.45 159.36 B: [laughter] 

167.34 168.28 B: yeah 

170.12 171.77 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

170.62 174.66 A: so i usually hang up the phone and then my husband just decided he was gonna 

174.68 179.80 A: let it go for a while and see what it happen and he said yeah it's it's from some 

180.07 181.29 A: some 

181.32 183.88 A: college or some university in 

183.69 184.77 B: mhm 

184.14 190.18 A: on the east coast and i said oh yeah i signed up for that [laughter] [laughter] if i had known i would have waited 

186.51 187.97 B: yeah 

189.94 190.89 B: sure 

190.21 198.07 A: but they called earlier tonight and i waited and waited and waited and nothing happened so i i hung up the phone and they called back again 

196.12 197.63 B: right now actually 

198.17 201.55 B: right now it it happened at once that's fine 

198.89 200.00 A: (( [noise] )) 

200.56 205.57 A: sorry about that my son just knocked the phone out of my hand go play go play with dada go play 

206.20 207.46 A: (( [mn] )) 

207.88 209.00 B: so um 

208.94 213.16 A: so yeah i mean this is the first time that i've actually successfully been 

213.20 214.16 A: (( you know )) 

214.81 215.83 A: (( um )) 

215.16 217.82 B: participating in anything like this yeah 

218.04 220.44 B: (( in this kind of research or something )) 

219.21 223.69 A: then uh connected with somebody you know [laughter] 

221.49 222.61 B: yeah 

222.81 228.16 B: it's kinda strange [laughter] but um so um 

229.04 234.55 B: i really think that all this relationship and partners really depends on the age 

235.04 235.97 B: um 

236.00 236.67 B: (( think )) 

236.13 237.42 A: i think so too 

237.23 244.53 B: because and when people are even dating it's different when people live together for ten years already 

244.28 245.10 A: (( true )) 

244.96 245.93 B: so 

245.85 246.81 A: sure 

246.28 249.29 B: and it probably changes even 

249.48 252.96 B: within one person's mind all the time so 

251.58 252.43 A: sure 

253.60 263.23 A: but that's always what i've looked for first is honesty i figure you know somebody's not gonna if they're not gonna tell you the truth then there really isn't anything to base your relationship on 

263.42 265.33 B: well and probably is 

265.46 268.68 B: there is i'm from russia actually myself 

269.10 271.71 B: so and i'm married to an american guy 

271.26 272.19 A: okay 

271.77 283.50 B: and but we have a like a proverb or saying that like i don't know if you say like this here to um as sweet um the bitter truth is better than the sweet lie 

284.07 287.85 B: so it's kinda that type well you understood yeah 

287.45 289.01 A: sure sure 

288.24 290.49 B: so do they say like this here too 

290.56 293.72 A: something like that yeah [laughter] 

292.23 298.55 B: okay [laughter] but you know i i think it's not always the best thing to say 

298.60 299.70 A: mhm 

298.96 300.85 B: the true thing 

300.81 309.88 B: like my husband he doesn't say well it depends what honest i mean how honest he should be you mean but sometimes he 

308.49 309.31 A: right 

309.83 321.50 B: like he says it about budget or money or about something like he probably might not say something you know just go round like figuring out later that um he kinda lied about something 

312.63 313.50 A: uh-huh 

321.06 323.48 A: [laughter] 

321.92 336.55 B: [laughter] so well i mean not really bad things but it's like oh we didn't have money he tried to show that we had [mn] we had or something that kinda kinda okay type of not being honest when you're trying to well kinda okay i mean 

325.25 326.32 A: mhm 

336.80 347.08 A: if you're trying to protect somebody else my husband does that too he'll not tell me something just because he thinks it's it's better for me [laughter] but it usually isn't you know 

337.90 340.07 B: well yes it seems 

343.88 345.87 B: yeah well 

346.80 348.25 B: yeah it's better 

347.42 350.23 A: (( i'd like to know so that i can you know )) 

348.28 350.80 B: sure it's like same 

350.87 353.81 A: have input on it [laughter] 

351.08 363.18 B: thing yeah you're thinking it's good and you're you know enjoying it and doing more and more of that stuff say spending moneys and for example and then it's like we don't them but um 

357.36 358.24 A: (( right )) 

360.28 361.07 A: right 

363.20 365.10 B: so i don't know if 

365.45 369.88 B: honesty's like uh in that way the most important thing so 

370.82 372.09 B: but uh 

372.49 380.38 B: [mn] it just depends i don't think it's can it can be really just one thing it can't be 

372.50 374.12 A: it's a tough question 

374.67 375.61 A: anyway 

378.18 381.50 A: one thing exactly exactly 

380.64 384.89 B: a little bit of that and of that and everything twines kinda so 

383.20 384.13 A: mhm 

385.70 387.42 B: (( and so like that yeah )) 

386.59 393.39 A: because i really appreciate my husband's sense of humor but i wouldn't put that first you know [laughter] 

391.21 393.35 B: [laughter] right 

394.29 396.61 A: yeah but to me it's it's 

396.65 407.81 A: honesty because i think that's the building block for your relationship that's like the biggest one and if if you have that then you can usually work around everything else 

408.17 411.62 B: well what do you mean honesty it's like um 

411.76 412.53 B: (( how )) 

411.96 414.88 A: truth like truthfulness you know like 

415.56 416.28 A: like 

416.14 421.49 B: well how honest i mean all the way honest or just about 

417.81 419.23 A: (( [mn] )) 

420.76 427.70 A: well that comes as your relationship grows though at least it should anyway as you become more comfortable with each other it will 

424.71 425.72 B: yeah 

427.75 429.66 A: just kinda fall into place 

431.40 435.20 A: and i guess we're older too my husband is is uh 

436.01 436.97 A: uh 

437.46 439.84 A: thirteen years older than i am so 

439.87 442.73 B: well my husband is same 

441.24 442.50 A: the ages 

442.99 444.70 A: it's a big thing you know 

443.03 444.16 B: same age 

444.40 445.06 B: (( huh )) 

445.05 448.13 A: the ages is a big thing like you said 

447.90 457.57 B: well my husband is older than i am something like about fourteen years too something like i even don't know how much actually we're married three years already 

452.55 453.58 A: mhm 

456.73 458.39 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

457.66 466.62 B: and i also had i changed i've changed since the first time i met i mean i met him and we're married and everything 

466.77 467.94 B: and also 

468.34 472.33 B: so but still it's um probably also environment 

472.63 479.56 B: if you're working or not you're looking or if you're it depends on each person i guess yeah really 

477.98 479.32 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] mhm )) 

480.46 484.43 B: oh well god it's so it's a hard question 

484.86 492.48 B: i don't know are are we supposed to talk talk talk talk and then they're like disconnect us or are we just say bye bye and you know 

491.78 497.13 A: i don't know this is the first time i've ever i've ever done this successfully so 

494.31 495.14 B: oh 

495.17 498.89 B: at least they should issue you some instructions or something 

498.20 500.81 A: no you know some lady called me 

500.94 515.00 A: and you know she asked me if i had got a confirmation email with my p._i._n. and i said no and so she gave it to me and that was it that was like the most [laughter] the most uh in- information i got about this whole program 

509.82 511.10 B: okay 

513.27 518.86 B: okay 'cause i did i did it through the internet so then it didn't say anything there either 

518.27 522.72 A: right yeah i haven't i never got an email back or anything so 

521.97 525.47 B: [mn] i got but it didn't say anything it didn't 

523.50 524.35 A: i don't 

524.92 531.37 A: i suppose that in all that that they will at some point i mean you can only record for so long i would imagine 

528.19 529.45 B: [laughter] 

530.95 532.96 B: i guess [laughter] 

533.43 536.97 B: well at least they should provide some questions or something 

537.04 540.94 B: to answer because it's so hard well you said once you said twice but 

537.11 537.97 A: right 

541.68 546.39 B: i i don't what even to say more how to discuss all those things 

546.37 547.41 A: right 

546.79 548.08 B: because uh 

549.47 556.90 B: so hard and do you see any changes oh have you changed with the time you're married well for how long 

556.12 557.80 A: have i changed 

557.48 567.46 B: yeah well your i mean um your um you what you say the most important thing for you is honesty have you changed with time 

565.44 571.46 A: yeah no pretty much that's always been in all of my relationships because like i said if 

571.69 573.46 A: if you don't have that 

573.74 577.90 A: that truthfulness and that honesty then you really can't build your relationship 

577.94 580.08 A: up from that point you know 

579.74 580.70 B: mhm 

580.38 582.89 A: because if you can't trust the other person 

583.53 592.10 A: you know then to me it's really not worth it to to go on and start a family and the whole nine yards [laughter] 

588.21 589.71 B: yeah of course 

590.52 592.62 B: yeah yeah that's true 

592.23 599.89 A: but i've always gone out with older men and i find that that helps as far as the honesty because they're gotten past that young and impetuous 

597.92 598.95 B: yeah
