58.83 61.45 A: had armed guards in the airports and 

61.77 62.28 A: um 

63.01 65.66 A: in railway stations and places like that and it's always 

66.31 70.12 A: i i think it does make a big difference i don't think they have nearly the kind of 

70.53 70.95 A: um 

71.27 72.87 A: problems we have in our airport 

77.18 78.48 A: is this the first one you've done mary 

78.67 81.56 B: oh yes 

79.21 80.60 A: uh okay me too 

81.28 88.41 A: me too yeah they keep on trying to get a hold of me i was just on my way to bed so i hope i'm coherent 

85.41 87.47 B: oh i was 

87.93 91.03 B: watching i watch the state of the union and then 

91.92 92.46 B: guess i was 

92.62 101.00 B: interested in what he was saying and i guess that has to do with whatever we're supposed to talk about cause i was curious is what he was if we're going to war or not i guess 

96.31 97.44 A: oh okay 

101.37 102.89 B: yeah but 

102.40 107.50 A: yeah oh absolutely yeah if we went to war then you'd have to have airport security i would think 

107.78 108.29 A: sure 

109.04 110.94 A: are we supposed to wait for them to come back on 

111.61 114.42 B: i don't know i know we're supposed to talk about ten minutes but 

114.56 117.45 B: i think that's what it said 

117.06 120.98 A: i didn't even read i didn't read the email to find out exactly what i'm supposed to do 

121.51 122.74 A: it's okay um 

123.67 126.68 A: i didn't get to see the state of the union did they say what they were going to do 

126.96 129.95 B: no but he's pushing real hard so i think yes 

129.98 131.59 A: yeah you do (( )) 

131.93 132.35 A: too bad 

133.07 134.74 B: probably war 

134.10 135.36 A: (( )) yeah i kind of 

135.54 139.50 A: was hoping they would decide that they had gotten enough information 

139.99 141.25 B: i'm hoping the same thing 

140.15 141.29 A: not to have to do that 

141.53 145.30 A: and i've got a son that's twenty one and i don't want that to happen 

144.62 146.56 B: yeah i was thinking always the older 

146.68 147.63 B: always the older men 

147.72 149.56 B: willing to send the young ones to 

149.69 150.72 A: yeah they sure are 

156.54 157.76 B: nope i'm not either 

157.42 158.24 A: i'm 

159.35 162.51 A: i'm pretty certain that if that happens we probably will have 

163.19 167.48 A: increased security in the air force no doubt about that 

167.59 169.19 B: i really wasn't sure 

169.47 171.14 B: again not sure what they were 

172.33 172.83 B: um 

173.80 181.33 B: want us to talk about and like i said i don't fly i never have i just drive around here a small town no uh-huh no 

178.40 179.40 A: oh you've never flown 

180.17 181.22 A: haven't you oh 

181.96 182.38 A: yeah 

182.03 183.63 B: um mm the only thing 

182.50 189.09 A: uh i used to quite a bit but i don't anymore we used to when we were younger and and had our own business we used to fly to uh 

189.24 191.37 A: gift shows we used to take our son with us and 

191.64 193.65 A: he was little when we used to take him and 

195.45 196.78 A: and all i can say now it's 

197.54 198.05 A: mostly 

198.78 205.00 A: i don't have time for one and secondly i just don't feel secure enough anymore to fly 

205.83 206.18 A: i just 

207.80 209.90 A: security in the airports i'm so much concerned with it 

210.03 210.91 A: (( )) actual 

211.14 212.68 A: flying so 

212.54 213.16 B: (( )) 

213.26 216.91 B: does it um because you have does it take longer 

218.02 218.70 B: now 

219.03 220.06 B: to get through 

221.57 222.09 A: what do you mean 

222.17 225.00 B: does it take longer to get through security now than it did before 

224.40 226.72 A: it oh yeah a lot a lot longer 

226.76 227.34 B: okay 

226.90 229.42 A: um i've taken other folks to the airport and 

229.92 241.36 A: and seen them off and um you can't even get near the gates anymore used to be able you you could go right down to the gates with a person and drop them off now they don't even let you down to the gate with the person that you're with 

241.95 242.99 A: unless you're ticketed 

241.97 242.90 B: oh okay 

243.19 245.89 A: you can't go down to the gates and used to be able to do that 

244.71 245.11 B: now 

245.90 249.47 B: i didn't realize that cause yeah i've we live by the pittsburgh airport and 

250.13 253.64 A: yeah we live near uh akron canton and cleveland in ohio 

250.22 250.73 B: um 

251.00 251.73 B: we're the ones that 

252.79 253.46 B: okay 

253.73 255.34 B: yep and we're the ones that are always picking up 

255.57 256.19 B: family 

256.30 257.15 A: yeah us too 

257.01 260.01 B: and i guess that's how long it's been since we've picked anybody up because 

260.11 260.57 A: right 

260.12 262.53 B: last time i went we could go right down to the gate 

262.49 262.91 A: yep 

263.16 267.52 A: yep we used to be able to go right down to the gate in akron canton or cleveland either one 

267.97 272.01 A: and the cleveland airport they've really tightened it down since you can't even get close to the gates 

272.53 276.38 A: uh akron canton we can go right to where you can see the gates that you just can't get to them 

276.99 277.99 A: and um 

278.09 279.90 A: they've they've made it so that uh 

280.66 283.71 A: you (( )) you know if you were going down to the gates and you're ticketed 

284.07 285.23 A: you still have to go through 

285.66 286.91 A: a lot to get there 

287.32 292.07 A: they they check your luggage of course in the back you know when you drop it off 

292.53 294.21 A: and they also check um 

295.75 299.49 A: uh your personal belongings and all your carry-ons as you go through the 
301.71 303.84 A: passage way into th- where the gates are 

304.23 304.94 A: get your flight 

305.42 305.95 A: so 

306.11 307.31 A: that there's quite a bit a 

307.45 309.75 A: and the and eh they always did the uh 

310.15 312.00 A: the carry-ons they always did that 

313.20 314.64 A: they're getting a lot more stringent 

315.30 316.45 A: about the um 

318.65 319.86 A: the luggage that 

320.16 320.97 A: is brought in 

321.15 323.09 B: okay so the carry-on always went through the 

323.08 323.99 A: always yes 

323.84 325.31 B: screeners whatever that is 

324.39 326.22 A: yeah you always had to do that 

326.30 327.00 B: okay 

326.84 328.58 A: yeah and metal detectors 

328.79 330.64 A: you know we always had metal detectors 

328.87 329.13 B: yep 

330.32 332.33 B: yes i remember that i remember going through those 

332.43 333.03 A: yeah 

332.52 333.48 B: to go back but 

333.22 334.47 A: yeah they were they were a 

334.58 337.52 A: not as sensitive as they are now it's a little bit more of a pain 

337.99 340.47 A: i had a real hard time getting through metal detectors 

340.99 343.01 A: even with just certain pieces of jewelry 

343.55 350.87 A: and practically have to strip any kind of jewelry i have on just to get through a metal metal detector used to not be that way 

351.32 352.40 A: used to i think it 

352.60 354.16 A: they've become a lot more sensitive 

354.95 358.94 A: and um they do ju- search purses where they never used to do that before 

359.08 360.53 A: i had a friend who went to 

360.90 362.21 A: washington d._c. 

362.89 364.29 A: and she said they actually 

365.43 366.32 A: because she had 

366.76 367.25 A: um 

367.64 368.17 A: metal 

368.60 369.00 A: like 

369.21 379.10 A: pieces in her bra they had to check her bra cause it was you know they they just checked everything you see they actually patted her down in washington d._c. 

379.78 382.58 A: so you know some of it's just a little overboard 

384.71 386.61 B: encouraging but what about uh 

387.29 388.88 B: oh how's the guy that had the 

389.58 390.59 B: bomb in his shoes 

391.00 391.39 A: yeah 

391.46 394.37 B: now can they pick anything like that up or no is it just metal 

393.53 396.70 A: nah probably not probably not i wouldn't think so 

394.83 395.39 B: okay 

396.91 398.41 A: because it you know the 

398.64 401.10 A: the scan is really only down to your about your 

401.42 402.48 A: about your knees 

402.67 404.51 A: i don't think it really scans that low 

405.44 405.83 A: hey 

406.07 407.69 B: okay well i just wondered (( )) 

406.94 411.71 A: so it's some security you know really needs to be beefed up and other other types of security 

412.27 413.91 A: they just go a little bit too much 

414.16 415.67 A: in that direction 

416.34 417.97 A: i don't i know they can't really uh 

419.31 423.18 A: but i i would think they do more background check on the people they actually sold tickets too 

423.92 424.37 A: um 

425.16 427.02 A: place where i worked we sell cell phone 

427.91 428.83 A: and um 

430.65 436.14 A: in the cell phone business sometimes it be kind of scary you wish that you actually knew who you were selling them too 

436.55 438.54 A: you'd get uh 

438.99 439.94 A: a lot of um 

440.40 441.81 A: arab business that would 

442.36 445.35 A: sound as though they were trying to get phones all over the country 

445.74 446.28 A: with 

446.76 447.90 A: adjoining numbers 

449.02 450.13 B: wow 

449.33 451.14 A: and it would be real real scary 

451.42 455.89 A: you know and it used to be about a year ago they asked us to report those to the f._b._i. 

456.30 457.61 A: well they don't do that anymore 

458.02 458.82 A: and they don't care 

459.03 460.35 A: you know they don't want to hear from us 

460.47 461.42 A: so 

461.43 461.84 B: (( )) 

461.96 462.28 A: but 

462.49 464.90 A: they did a year ago when it seemed important to them 

466.28 466.66 A: so 

468.06 471.58 A: i don't know it's you know they're just let you know they're forgetting 

468.78 470.54 B: maybe just too much of it going on 

471.75 473.95 A: they're they're forgetting and they're forgetting 

474.51 478.33 A: you know that things do happen if they'd been a little bit more aware maybe they 

483.08 483.44 A: i don't 

489.57 489.90 A: (( )) 

490.13 495.86 A: spend a year or more after a tragedy then they get a little lackadaisical an- and lessen things up a little bit and 

496.60 498.98 A: don't pay attention to certain things or whatever 

499.72 500.01 A: but 

500.83 503.57 A: that's why i'm not real crazy about flying is that i 

504.70 505.09 A: i don't 

505.21 506.11 A: i don't trust 

506.35 507.23 A: the folks who 

507.63 513.15 A: run the airlines you know they're going they're going to be in it for the money you know 

508.79 511.04 B: the ones making the decisions 

512.55 513.76 B: yeah that's true 

513.68 515.76 A: they're going they're going to do whatever it takes to 

516.11 516.89 A: make the buck 

516.12 516.46 B: well that's 

516.83 520.51 B: what i wondered about the more scanning and stuff more it that 

520.74 524.74 B: being so much more longer isn't it costing them more money that way or 

524.78 526.86 A: you would think you would think 

527.71 532.76 A: i don't know tho- those folks have to be there eight hours a day they do their eight hour shift and go home anyway 

533.42 536.03 A: you know i don't know if they pay them a great deal 

536.35 539.90 A: from what i understand from somebody i know that did work airport security they 

540.28 541.54 A: put them a stringent 

541.67 543.23 A: security measures themselves 

544.28 546.75 A: to make sure they have no criminal background whatsoever 

547.24 550.14 A: and a very stringent training as well 

550.83 551.34 A: um 

551.77 556.30 A: um for all types of situations and the interview process takes weeks 

556.80 559.12 A: to get one of those jobs and they don't pay that well 

562.43 564.14 B: yes so not a big incentive to
