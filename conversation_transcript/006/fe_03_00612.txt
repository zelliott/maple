373.70 375.19 B: they think it's a southern accent 

375.50 375.97 A: oh 

376.32 379.56 B: but i think it kind of comes from speaking spanish at home a lot

385.93 386.58 B: yeah i speak

396.92 399.91 B: sometimes i'm on the computer i'll be in a chat room and 

397.57 398.42 A: oh yeah

404.02 404.46 A: yeah 

404.67 408.34 B: and this is like kind of contagious i catch myself talking like it

409.47 411.44 A: yeah i know someone else who does that too 

412.97 414.84 B: and not on purpose or anything it's just 

413.97 414.56 A: no 

416.82 418.28 B: because i notice with people who 

418.39 419.46 B: speak spanish 

420.46 420.93 B: they don't 

421.27 422.37 B: understand
