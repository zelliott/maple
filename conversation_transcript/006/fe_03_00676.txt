3.65 5.19 B: hi my name is matt 

6.16 6.78 B: ah 

9.07 11.58 B: you think it's going to you that more airports 

11.75 12.37 B: security 

12.85 14.57 B: ah could help 

14.96 15.53 A: yeah 

15.71 16.51 A: i think so 

15.83 16.32 B: yeah 

16.90 18.08 A: i think because um 

18.38 21.10 A: what they found um recently 

21.83 23.83 A: in doing by upping it 

24.12 33.26 A: the security they have found a lot more weapons and they have probably saved more lives because of it and i don't think just if it's a little bit inconvenience 

33.38 34.25 A: i don't think that 

34.38 36.24 A: you know it's worth saving lives 

36.86 37.28 B: yeah 

38.22 38.81 B: um 

39.06 40.99 B: yeah no i i agree i think i think 

41.69 42.24 B: that that's 

42.74 45.45 B: certainly almost goes without question that you have to check 

45.54 46.58 B: that stuff thoroughly 

47.02 47.53 B: um 

47.05 50.06 A: yeah because it could of saves a lot of peoples lives that day you know 

47.80 49.14 B: do you have any (( )) 

50.43 51.75 B: yeah 

50.47 50.84 A: yeah 

51.45 52.81 A: yep 

52.28 52.91 B: yeah they didn't have 

53.22 53.73 B: and 

54.80 59.23 B: i guess i saw some story about ah the security in places like israel 

59.36 61.59 B: where it's really common and they've managed to 

59.41 59.80 A: uh-huh 

61.85 63.55 B: to lower the amount of hijackings 

64.03 66.35 B: very much because they've been very strict and they have 

66.80 68.46 B: the military in the in the airports 

69.06 73.25 B: but that's out of a much smaller population i suppose they try to control and only a few 

73.51 73.98 B: airport 

74.49 74.96 B: um 

75.36 81.97 A: and you know they don't advertise they're not going to sit there and advertise that they found all this you know um 

77.81 78.29 B: mhm 

82.23 93.90 A: um equipment and um weapons on people you know what i mean so it's not going to be like oh well we just saved ah two hundred lives they don't know how many lives they saved in the security 

86.42 86.71 B: yeah 

94.00 96.39 A: and i think it is well worth it i think it is a good investment 

96.73 97.10 B: yeah

97.78 99.26 B: have you have you flown lately

124.74 125.13 B: yeah 

125.01 132.35 A: so that we know you know to you didn't want to sound off anything so we knew what not to bring with us so that wasn't an issue

453.87 454.47 B: mhm 

453.94 458.40 A: you and sometimes bad things have to happen before somebody realizes that we have an issue that we have to 

458.68 459.05 B: yeah 

458.72 459.73 A: address you know 

459.92 460.21 B: yeah
