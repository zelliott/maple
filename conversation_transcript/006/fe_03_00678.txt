54.49 57.50 A: the cra- crash into the big b- 

58.55 60.00 B: you haven't 

60.02 61.93 B: i did a couple of weeks ago 

62.31 67.95 B: and i know i felt a lot safer i think i mean for me anyway 

68.05 71.29 B: knowing that they're watching everything [laughter] 

73.60 74.64 A: (( well )) 

74.85 76.86 A: i think i had a uh 

77.40 83.12 A: um my sister's daughter came in on a airplane and we took her to the airport 

83.20 89.71 A: and we pick her picked her up but we walked her as far as we could walk her and um 

89.95 92.02 A: it looked a lot sa- safer 

93.26 100.88 B: right yeah it is my cousin i was with my cousin when we flew and she has shoes that have metal plates in them 

101.18 103.09 B: and she had to take them off 

103.24 107.05 B: when she was going through security so i mean i know they're really watching 

107.99 110.39 A: she didn't have to go barefooted did she 

110.22 114.09 B: just um when she 'til after she got through the 

114.25 115.18 B: um 

115.54 119.26 B: the security gate thing the metal detector 

119.49 124.73 B: 'cause this type of shoe that she has sketchers and they have metal in the shoes for some reason 

125.17 127.10 B: i'm not sure why [laughter] 

127.37 128.56 A: (( yeah i've )) 

128.23 134.35 B: but they just had to take them off and then they checked them to see if there was anything else other than just the 

135.13 137.38 B: the normal thing that's in there 

139.93 146.11 B: but i i was scared right afterwards you know as far as flying and what it was going to be like but 

146.73 156.67 B: i know it hasn't [noise] changed anything as far as wait time i mean when we were at the airport we didn't have to [noise] stand in really long lines or anything 

156.90 159.42 B: [noise] 

158.80 161.30 A: always been afraid to fly anyway 

160.80 161.90 B: have you 

162.53 168.24 A: unless there was a death in the family i don't think you know it could get me on an airplane 

168.21 171.78 B: yeah my mother's that way too 

173.05 178.80 B: but uh i love to fly and i didn't for the longest time afterwards but 

178.99 184.77 B: i think i feel safer with having that extra security there and people checking and 

185.02 188.81 B: knowing that people aren't going to get any farther than what they are supposed to go 

190.09 190.88 A: yeah 

191.36 192.78 A: i didn't they 

192.82 196.75 A: turn it over to military this checking people now 

197.08 198.09 B: um 

199.64 204.43 B: i'm not sure if it's military exactly or if it's just government 

204.73 209.56 B: employees or you know that they hired special people for the security 

209.81 213.80 B: instead of just any kind of joe schmo coming off the street [laughter] 

210.25 210.81 A: (( [mn] )) 

214.19 218.11 A: yeah [laughter] so they had to go through ah um 

218.47 222.30 A: more security before they could even get the job i guess 

221.60 226.71 B: right yeah like a high security level position is what it's like they're applying for now 

227.12 231.13 B: [noise] they probably check everything about the person [laughter] 

231.79 234.99 A: and i heard from somebody else that 

235.07 236.16 A: um 

236.54 241.11 A: that the people are nicer that check are checking you out 

241.35 244.16 A: they're not so rude 

244.94 252.10 B: yeah you know come to think of it they were the people that 'cause i've flown through the same airport before and the people were nicer 

252.15 254.90 B: that checked us through a lot more patient 

255.15 256.18 B: you know 

257.12 258.14 B: (( i don't know )) 

261.00 268.93 B: but i know after the experience i just had and this was actually my first time flying since then um i i definitely would fly again 

270.61 273.12 B: without any second thoughts about it 

276.69 280.51 A: well i just have a fear of flying altogether so 

280.08 281.34 B: (( [noise] yeah ))

324.22 326.94 B: and that was difficult [laughter] 

326.95 330.27 B: but yeah i wouldn't like going just by myself 

331.10 333.46 A: and i smoke [noise] so 

333.61 341.57 A: they had these rooms you go in and the rooms are full of smoke with people [noise] just standing in this little room smoking [laughter]

344.21 345.45 B: yeah 

345.54 348.65 B: you wouldn't need one with all the smoke that's already in there 

349.20 352.46 A: and i don't i [noise] went in the bar 

351.63 352.53 B: [noise]

507.37 513.62 B: have something to start with anyway but i don't know if it's just about that subject or if they just want to see 

514.02 515.12 B: how
