60.71 61.28 B: yeah 

60.78 61.22 A: but uh 

61.43 63.12 A: i think the biggest change is i've really 

63.83 64.51 A: you know 

64.66 70.94 A: taken in to consideration how important it is to you know talk to my family cause it can you know be a tomorrow type of thing 

69.32 69.70 B: mhm 

71.48 71.92 B: mhm 

72.31 73.59 A: so 

73.47 77.11 B: are you more afraid of a tax now than you were before 

77.67 78.12 A: um 

78.47 81.92 A: i'm a more aware of it i mean i knew that they could do it any time but 

82.09 82.55 B: yeah 

82.61 88.52 A: now uh that they've actually you know been bold enough to do it it's not going to uh i don't think it's going to be the last time 

88.70 89.25 B: yeah 

90.56 93.36 B: well i grew up in germany and um 

93.59 99.71 B: in the seventies eighties or you know other times in europe that was always a big threat especially at 

93.62 94.17 A: oh wow 

100.06 102.73 B: public places airports and you know 

103.24 104.42 B: restaurants club 

105.01 107.69 A: (( )) been kind of exciting but scary i would think to 

105.31 105.93 B: (( )) 

107.56 109.72 B: yeah and so so i um 

108.55 108.82 A: (( )) 

110.98 114.71 B: i don't know to that it wasn't to that extent but uh it was 

114.85 118.38 B: people were more afraid and were more aware of it over there 

118.68 119.51 A: would you say that 

118.76 125.93 B: all the time and and here especially with air travel you could just walk in and out of the airport and it was no big 

126.02 127.15 B: deal and there was no 

128.15 129.91 B: uh um awareness of 

130.05 132.09 B: about security 

132.58 136.00 B: but uh you know i think that is just one aspect um 

137.20 141.72 B: i think you know that other places that could be attacked that (( )) is bad 

142.03 142.71 B: than the airport 

142.07 142.95 A: exactly 

143.37 145.80 A: do you think that people here are are 

146.28 149.89 A: serving science as they did in germany when you were there in the eighties 

150.59 151.22 B: mhm 

151.81 153.76 A: over there (( )) would you say or 

154.90 158.41 B: i think this brought a a greater awareness in the (( )) 

158.72 161.05 B: measures being taken now that 

162.28 165.13 B: mhm i think maybe this country wasn't as prepared 

165.37 165.83 A: mhm 

166.43 173.80 B: for example uh with uh immigration not as prepared to screen people or to look for people you know 

166.98 167.50 A: yeah 

169.88 170.31 A: mhm 

173.97 174.45 A: mhm 

175.18 176.17 A: yeah that's true 

176.61 178.71 A: i think i think we were a little to uh 

179.26 182.68 A: i don't want to say egotistical but we never thought it could happen to us and 

182.43 183.09 B: yeah 

183.33 186.90 A: yeah could've helped with another country but not us cause they're too big and 

186.68 191.02 B: yeah what i also noticed about here people are very uh mm 

193.28 197.90 B: oh how do you want to put this very proud of their independence proud of their 

198.03 198.54 B: mhm 

199.67 201.00 A: where they're from their roots 

200.72 210.53 B: oh that's i don't want a freedom is is such a cliche but you know to to go anywhere and do anything they want to do they they want don't want to be regulated and checked and 

210.33 211.31 A: exactly 

210.96 216.84 B: uh and you don't carry a cre- uh um an i. d. card with them everywhere and things like that 

217.14 217.82 B: uh i don't know 

217.18 218.36 A: yeah definitely 

218.93 222.29 A: what do you see is going to happen with the the economy do you think it's going to 

222.73 225.42 A: pick up at all or keep going downhill like it has been 

226.11 228.23 B: i think that um 

228.83 236.30 B: i think the economy will stay down for a while i think that people are very unsure of what is about to happen in the near future 

236.40 239.24 B: if if there is going to be a war or not then i don't know 

236.45 237.07 A: right 

250.23 253.41 B: going to improve in the next six months or so 

251.43 251.96 A: exact 

253.70 259.54 A: yeah uh at least in the next six months i think it's going to be a couple years especially if this war happens where 

255.71 256.24 B: yeah 

259.46 260.53 B: yeah yeah 

260.51 263.06 A: we're going to lose a lot of our men unfortunately

266.45 267.07 B: yeah 

268.14 268.87 A: but um
