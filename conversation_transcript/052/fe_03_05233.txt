0.22 2.86 B: hi i i'm david 

2.15 3.53 A: i'm mitch 

3.79 5.54 B: how are you doing mitch i 

4.80 6.11 A: how you doing 

6.20 8.36 A: what do you think is the worst 

8.40 10.76 B: i think what was the first choice 

10.49 12.92 A: (( ah gossiping )) 

12.96 15.65 B: okay so it was gossiping 

13.59 17.13 A: drinking drinking smoking and some other things 

17.12 24.30 B: okay not exercising i don't know i'm not a smoker so i guess i'd say ah 

19.24 20.48 A: right 

24.36 28.59 B: s- smoking would be um probably the worst for me 

27.46 31.17 A: yeah ah not smoking and not drinking 

31.91 34.08 B: i drink sometimes so 

34.05 34.98 A: uh-huh 

34.39 41.19 B: [laughter] so i guess i'm maybe a little biased you know i don't consider it all that bad i don't 

40.14 41.00 A: right 

41.24 42.73 B: i mean i 

42.70 57.27 B: i guess i mean it also depends you know obviously you know a person who smokes excessively is not going to do as much harm to their family or friends as a you know a ah mean drunk 

56.70 57.55 A: (( mm )) 

57.86 61.63 B: so i mean it also depends on 

62.28 66.12 B: but at the same time you know if i go out drinking 

66.55 68.98 B: and have a couple of drinks and i you know 

69.16 82.68 B: maybe technically that's ruining my body but i'm not really doing harm to anyone else but smoking you know even casually smoking you know pollutes the air for everyone who's breathing that air 

82.16 84.38 A: right what about gossiping 

85.07 87.40 B: well i mean i 

87.57 91.20 B: i guess if you hurt people's feelings and um 

91.20 93.55 A: especially if you talk behind their back 

93.41 94.79 B: (( yeah )) 

93.77 95.99 A: and then they find out about it 

95.87 103.89 B: yeah i mean if you hurt people's feelings but um i wouldn't consider it the worst thing in the world 

99.56 100.81 A: right 

102.32 103.26 A: no 

103.41 104.41 A: no 

104.25 110.27 B: and and again i guess it depends on what kind of gossip and what you're gossiping about and 

109.47 111.09 A: yeah that's true 

110.28 112.57 B: how harmful the gossip is 

111.93 114.83 A: well i think the worst is drinking and smoking 

115.44 117.48 B: you do- you don't drink or smoke 

116.96 119.79 A: no i can't i'm a diabetic 

119.21 120.37 B: (( oh okay )) 

120.52 126.64 A: but even so even besides that i still wouldn't because either one of them is dangerous 

127.38 128.64 B: yeah 

128.03 130.70 A: i don't know what the other topics were supposed to be 

130.87 139.44 B: um well i think um one was not exercising um maybe it was not reading i guess you know 

139.03 150.34 A: well not exercising um that's okay but i usually try to exercise but th- that's there's nothing really wrong with that unless you're really supposed to exercise for your ah health 

150.75 158.64 B: well i mean everyone's supposed to exercise for their health i guess but but you only do harm to yourself by not being healthy 

158.06 160.89 A: right by not by not exercising 

160.71 161.85 B: yeah 

161.14 166.80 A: but the most harmful two things are ah smoking and ah drinking 

166.50 173.10 B: yeah i can see that you know i mean other things that are less 

173.25 179.57 B: say it's gossiping for most part it sounds like they only hurt yourself they don't really 

177.87 178.72 A: yeah 

178.99 180.29 A: right 

179.60 181.15 B: extend beyond you 

180.81 182.16 A: right 

181.97 183.12 B: but um 

183.97 193.49 B: there are yeah i think you know for me in fact the order of them would be smoking drinking and um gossiping in that order 

192.87 197.66 A: right so what else are we supposed to talk about 

197.65 203.33 B: i think we're we're just supposed to talk about this and our opinions on 

202.81 205.01 A: right those topics 

205.07 207.79 B: and maybe also like i don't know 

207.96 210.22 B: we can expand on it and stuff 

210.05 211.09 A: [sigh] 

212.44 221.78 B: i mean once you get your opinions out you know unless we unless we have very different opinions on it you know it's not like we're going to debate about it 

221.18 226.89 A: yeah well i think smoking is is ah not only is it bad it's bad for other people 

226.85 230.45 B: exactly i mean i'm in new york city where um 

230.46 232.50 B: where bloomberg's just ah

235.22 243.64 B: public buildings bars and restaurants except for a few select um ones that have special permits 

243.25 248.12 A: right in new york they have a place called it it's like a ah cigar bar

381.52 385.19 B: um i don't know um 

385.82 388.39 B: i guess you know reading you know 

388.53 389.80 B: actually 

390.06 398.71 B: there you know people who are uneducated you know aren't very read up a- about anything 

398.01 400.41 A: because they can't they can't read

422.34 424.27 B: i have no idea 

423.52 425.25 A: (( hm )) 

425.64 429.69 B: i think that um we got an email i think you um 

430.52 433.52 A: i haven't checked i haven't the emails yet 

433.03 443.69 B: if you check your email i think you should have gotten an email and there is a contact person there who you can probably email and ask about that this is only my second time 

438.26 439.18 A: (( oh all )) 

440.92 441.94 A: right 

443.43 445.88 A: yeah well this is my second time 

446.08 448.37 A: but they don't give you all that much to talk about 

448.41 455.94 B: mhm well yeah i mean it depends on the topic i think last time it was a little bit better topic 

454.70 455.60 A: yeah 

457.19 461.50 A: well then we gotta stretch it out until they until they tell us the time is up 

461.24 464.05 B: yeah so i mean 

464.16 468.19 B: i'm wondering if it makes any difference where are you from 

467.53 468.72 A: philadelphia 

469.17 470.88 B: you're in philadelphia right now 

470.39 471.57 A: yeah 

471.49 472.45 B: okay 

472.64 480.40 B: i'm in new york now you know because i'm wondering if if you went to like say california if there would be a difference 

480.48 483.12 B: of opinions or if you went to you know 

483.63 485.71 B: florida or you know 

485.91 489.46 B: or alaska if people would 

489.52 492.78 B: think differently about what's worse 

492.35 506.05 A: right right well i think they just want conversation because they're probably recording them and this has to do with some research at the university of pennsylvania linguistics lab that's all i know about it 

503.63 504.61 B: mhm 

506.85 507.81 B: uh-huh 

507.76 511.94 A: it's a scientific research on on linguistics 

512.23 515.28 B: on linguistics so it's just like talking basically 

514.55 521.68 A: right right right some kind of experimentation done by the university of pennsylvania 

521.13 523.78 B: yeah okay 

524.75 532.84 B: so i mean do you think that you have your opinions about what's worse and better is similar to you the people around you that you know 

532.49 536.92 A: y- well my opinions is that drinking and smoking are not good for you 

536.98 539.08 A: (( and i don't believe in one of them )) 

539.03 543.68 B: but i mean that's um part of that is because you said you're a diabetic 

543.04 544.36 A: right 

543.74 551.51 B: but um i was wondering if you thought that people you know like your friends or family would have similar opinions 

551.28 553.11 A: oh i don't know about that 

552.49 553.93 B: because you know 

553.45 556.82 A: i never got into that m- i i couldn't i don't know 

557.12 559.03 A: i have no idea 

559.00 562.78 B: of course on a college campus you know i think 

563.47 565.29 A: what what college 

564.86 575.92 B: um columbia university i think um especially drinking and smoking people do it all the time it but and you're attuned new york is 

566.20 567.57 A: right 

572.83 573.91 A: right 

575.88 589.58 B: a big smoky town you know i'm not a smoker i never really smoked i never smoked i mean i should say never really i never smoked but um new york is just a smoking town so it's kind of interesting to 

579.49 580.98 A: mm 

583.24 584.15 A: right 

590.99 591.99 B: (( um )) 

592.30 593.85 B: you know we have 

594.21 598.04 B: a what we don't do but you know 

598.13 599.89 B: you talk to people who do smoke
