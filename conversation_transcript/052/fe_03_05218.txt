0.84 2.01 B: hi 

1.63 3.88 A: hello my name is rick 

3.78 4.96 B: i'm ivan 

4.57 6.04 A: hi ivan how are you 

5.85 7.56 B: doing good how are you rick 

6.95 15.00 A: good when i ah heard the topic was ah illness i thought i had a lot to talk about but then after you connect and it says ah 

15.05 22.37 A: as the seasons change do you get sick i'm like well no i don't have a lot to say about that but then they turned that ah colds 

19.27 21.32 B: [laughter] 

22.68 32.82 A: lasts seven days if you don't go to the doctor and a week if you do i w- i i been pondering that the last couple of seconds and i found it [noise] funny at first and then i thought well seven days 

32.74 38.75 A: seem a lot [noise] longer than a week especially when you have a cold so i i had never heard that before i thought that [noise] was funny [noise] [noise] 

38.38 40.25 B: yeah i've i've never heard that either 

40.37 45.79 B: but regardless of whether you think it's the same or longer it's the same amount of time so 

44.58 46.23 A: [noise] right [noise] 

46.09 50.00 B: is it questioning our perception of time or is it questioning 

50.11 55.44 B: the irrev- irrelevance of going to the doctor with a cold 

54.20 67.31 A: ah i thought of i thought of the time when [noise] you're sitting at home sick with a ah a cold it ah the seven [noise] grueling days they do seems to go by a lot slower than than when you think of a week on the calender [noise] 

66.93 71.30 B: yeah well i thought about it the other way 'cause actually last time that i had a cold 

71.56 78.27 B: ah it seemed like it was going on forever so i ended up going to the doctor to get some some ah stuff i get i think it was actually 

78.51 83.73 B: something that required antibiotics but ah it still lasted 

79.74 80.95 A: (( [noise] )) 

83.99 85.14 B: (( for )) 

85.23 88.42 B: a little while longer and i probably 

88.57 93.77 B: would've gotten better on my own even if i hadn't gone to the doctor so 

94.08 104.69 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] hm interesting [noise] interesting the ah the comment on there about ah as the weather changes i have a i know a lot of people that when the season changes they have 

104.75 119.09 A: um allergies like in the springtime and summertime and ah ah fortunately i've ah i've been blessed in in that regard in that i i just get to watch the other people suffer i don't suffer ah personally from that how 'bout yourself [noise] [noise] ugh [noise] 

106.00 107.81 B: mhm 

118.71 123.91 B: well i never did ah i'm currently in in texas 

124.49 130.06 B: and the not the first year but maybe the second year after i'd moved here 

130.39 134.90 B: in the spring and in the fall i got sinus infection 

135.49 137.93 B: and ah it would last for 

136.44 137.26 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

139.17 153.20 B: [mn] i'm not sure exactly how long but i remember going to the doctor for the first time thinking that i had the flu or some- something and she was like no it's allergies i'm like what do you mean allergies i'm twenty eight i've never had allergies in my life 

151.74 153.68 A: yeah yeah 

153.88 158.55 B: she's like well have you lived in texas long i'm like no she's like well texas is known 

158.80 162.96 B: for a bad allergy area i go great 

162.41 172.20 A: [noise] interesting i thought it was the same thing too you're either born with them or without 'em but ah evidently you're in an area that attacks you more than than where you were before 

172.03 174.46 B: yeah so where are you located 

173.58 177.86 A: [noise] i'm in chicago ah been here all my life and ah [noise] 

174.55 176.19 B: in chicago okay 

179.20 186.20 A: with the the breeze coming off the lake i think it keeps our ah air relatively ah clean um [lipsmack] 

186.19 194.28 B: right i grew up on the gulf coast in florida and it was the same way you had the gulf breeze and probably less pollen in the air 

193.89 195.38 A: mhm mhm 

194.75 206.79 B: although well i don't know there was quite a bit of pollen i remember in the spring going out and the cars would have this film of pollen over them but i h- never had a an issue with anything so 

202.79 203.98 A: yeah 

206.69 213.83 A: well are you ah are you in texas ah temporarily for a job and then you can get out of there or ah is [mn] kind of [noise] 

212.34 216.70 B: well no my wife my wife grew here and her family's here so 

216.42 217.68 A: (( ah i )) 

216.91 218.55 B: we're probably here for 

218.63 220.21 B: a while 

220.61 223.60 B: ah we've talked about moving but have nothing 

223.80 228.95 B: on the horizon which would lead to a an easy departure 

229.31 233.65 A: see i see well is it something that can be cont- controlled with a prescription are you [noise] [noise] 

232.82 237.84 B: [mn] well i really she gave me clar- the doctor gave me claritin and i have not had an issue 

238.58 248.57 B: with taking it on a daily basis i just when it's i can tell when it's starts to come on and so i usually will take the claritin at that time and if i catch it 

248.86 259.44 B: quickly enough it ah i never really get a problem and it goes away and if there's only a [lipsmack] a ah short period of time that i'm even i guess vulnerable to it 

250.92 252.08 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

259.58 266.97 B: and that's r- that's when in texas we have very volatile weather so you know it be thirty degrees one day and seventy the next and then 

267.05 274.75 B: thirty the next and it's that extreme change in the temperature that as- appears to to affect me 

273.30 274.56 A: (( [noise] [noise] i see )) 

275.27 281.66 B: so i i i have claritin that i've had for two years before it was over the counter and [mn] 

280.39 281.62 A: mhm mhm 

281.81 285.89 B: i think i have they're expired now so i haven't i'll have to next time i have a 

286.55 288.06 B: an issue i'll have to go 

288.29 291.35 B: to the drug store so no it's not really a big deal 

290.93 291.93 A: (( good [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

291.70 292.58 B: so 

292.67 298.48 B: but it talked about like what do you do to prevent or you know for health i think that was another question 

298.56 299.86 B: i know that um 

300.59 303.32 B: [lipsmack] my wife and i take something called juice plus 

303.61 313.26 B: which is like a whole food product it's not really a vitamin what they do is they take whole fruits and vegetables dehydrate them put them in capsule form 

313.17 321.52 B: and so what you're doing is your taking stuff that has all the antioxidants all the vitamins and minerals in its natural form rather than it being processed out and stuck in a pill 

321.44 323.42 A: [noise] [noise] kind of like v8 in can 

323.31 326.68 B: something like that something like that except for not a lot of sodium 

323.86 325.56 A: [laughter] 

326.20 327.47 A: right 

327.00 336.07 B: and so i my wife and i have been on that for three of four years oh she's been on it longer than i i think i've only been on it two but i have not been sick 

335.96 346.16 B: other than a couple of allergy issues since i started that stuff and i don't know of course if it's contributed to that i've always had a strong immune system but 

338.76 339.93 A: mhm 

341.06 341.93 A: now 

344.97 350.72 A: i was just gonna ask you if you were healthy before that or if you noticed a significant difference once you started taking that 

348.93 355.53 B: i have noticed a significant difference whereas before i would be vulnerable to sniffles and colds and flu 

355.50 368.69 B: every year that kind of stuff i have not gotten flu shots and not done anything ah i also teach school so i'm always around people with colds and handling papers i haven't i've not gotten sick 

365.48 366.36 A: yeah 

368.60 370.82 A: can you give me the name of that i wanna write that down 

370.49 372.29 B: it's called juice plus 

372.08 373.83 A: juice plus 

372.99 384.93 B: it's very well documented it's i'm not i'm very skeptical of that type of of thing and i did research on it and and i went and listened to several doctors who were very ah 

377.27 378.85 A: mhm 

385.10 386.18 B: credible 

386.49 390.03 B: and also listened to a guy names jack 

390.61 392.35 B: jack bennett jack 

392.76 396.14 B: ah i forget his name now he was a gymnastics coach for 

396.58 401.94 B: ah the little girl that won back in like eighty eight or something [mn] with the big smile 

402.93 405.74 B: she won like the gold medal in olympics [mn] 

405.48 409.28 A: yeah there's a few ah with big smiles ah mary lou retton 

408.72 412.02 B: [mn] mary lou retton that's the one he was involved with her somehow 

409.51 410.69 A: yeah 

412.14 421.70 B: and he talked about it he dis- developed an independent company that did research on different vitamins because one of his gymnasts died by taking some stuff 

421.19 422.19 A: oh wow 

421.72 425.30 B: and he talked this stuff and how he broke it down and how it 

425.32 429.79 B: um came through with his his testing and it's it's really impressive stuff 

429.11 430.15 A: interesting 

429.96 430.82 B: so 

431.36 445.32 B: i figure a lot of people drink diet coke every day and all that nasty stuff and that's why i take ah a whole food product which works out i think it works out to be about a dollar and a quarter a day it's like forty bucks a month 

436.67 437.72 A: yeah 

437.80 438.77 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

445.28 451.26 B: but when you compare it to my mother who drinks at least three diet cokes a day 

450.88 453.31 A: yeah that stuff's not good 

452.77 454.48 B: no it's not 

453.56 456.33 A: but you can you can use that to remove ah 

456.47 462.59 A: stains off your furniture they say so i don't know what what they ah what at all is in it but it's not 

462.85 470.58 A: it's not not good for you but ah i definitely wanna check this out is it like something you can get al walgreens or do you have go to a health food store 

469.11 470.43 B: no 

470.57 472.56 B: well it's not even that it's it's 

470.90 473.14 A: or a vitamin store 

472.84 475.19 B: it's set up i think through 

476.78 488.97 B: [lipsmack] the easiest way to describe it is like multi level marketing but it's it's not it's not multi level marketing but you know you can get in and be a distributor my wife and i are actually a distributor but we don't sell it we just take it 

479.59 481.47 A: oh okay okay 

488.40 489.29 A: okay 

488.98 495.38 B: it was cheaper for us to become a distributor at the time but um i'm sure if you did a search on the internet 

491.24 492.10 A: okay 

495.04 498.31 A: yeah yeah i'm sure they have a website 

495.59 499.57 B: you'd find some information it's produced by a company called n._s._a. 

499.48 500.94 A: (( n._s._a. okay )) 

500.70 502.71 B: yeah and they're out of memphis 

502.54 503.36 A: okay 

503.44 506.70 B: i'm not sure what n._s._a. stands for but 

505.99 510.74 A: okay i'll put in juice plus and see what ah the search engine pulls up in ah 

510.36 516.79 B: yeah it might bring to like an individual um person but i'm sure that you could 

517.09 519.23 B: um get taken straight to 

519.52 523.60 B: the company i'm not exactly sure how the hierocracy works as i said i didn't really 

523.64 526.24 B: i don't pursue it i hate that stuff 

526.14 529.85 A: mhm the ah multi level marketing part of it yeah 

526.88 528.06 B: but 

528.11 532.56 B: yeah you know like- amway and all that stuff it's not even amway anymore but i got 

531.68 535.38 A: yeah herbal life is another one you ever hear of that one 

533.95 536.82 B: yeah mhm yeah 

535.49 542.08 A: see bumper stickers all over the place ah ask lose weight now ask me how and they have had their stickers 

537.87 538.72 B: yeah 

540.17 552.97 B: right but you have to research on the validity of 'em and and third party testing and all that stuff and juice plus if i remember correctly is one of the is the most documented stuff and it's not 

553.13 554.64 B: it's not a a 

555.00 556.55 B: ah the typical 

557.13 561.00 B: scam type stuff that's just looking to get your money and it has 

558.12 559.75 A: yeah 

561.15 561.95 B: (( ah )) 

562.10 563.31 A: benefits 

562.16 565.72 B: bad bad after or side effects 

565.81 572.09 B: it's just a whole food product and one thing that impresses is one of the doctors was saying that she the first thing she did was 

572.26 574.29 B: she took took the powder out of the 

574.77 588.20 B: the [sigh] capsule and added water to it and it rotted and so that it's not a chemical laden product it's a whole food product and i thought that's pretty impressive 

588.28 593.77 B: you know cause most things you get they're they got all the preservatives in 'em they'll outlast us all 

594.44 598.17 A: mhm mhm mhm mhm right right like twinkies [laughter] 

594.60 595.43 B: so 

597.37 598.47 B: (( [laughter] )) 

598.69 599.95 B: yeah 

599.39 599.89 A: (( twink ))
