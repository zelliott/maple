22.19 25.03 A: oh yeah [laughter] yeah this was it 

23.84 25.03 B: how about yourself 

25.33 36.63 A: yeah i had ah one one call before and ah the guy that i was talking to didn't talk about the topic the e- the entire call so it was kind of weird [laughter]

36.89 38.39 A: (( [laughter] )) 

37.22 40.40 B: ah so what what are your opinions 

41.14 51.17 A: ah bioterrorism um i don't know if ah there's a easy solution i don't think it's a preventable thing i think it's ah you know you can 

51.35 62.99 A: prevent the odds of it or lower the odds of it i guess um by ah i guess i don't know i guess what we're doing now with the ah war on terror and everything will will help 

63.55 65.37 A: (( ah i don't know what do you think )) 

65.23 66.54 B: i i 

65.50 66.06 A: (( [mn] )) 

66.55 70.17 B: somewhere along the same lines i c- i can i mean i think it's 

70.21 81.31 B: it's good obvious- you know ah unfortunately it took a an event such as september eleventh for us to i guess to be a little bit more proactive than reactive but 

80.39 81.28 A: uh-huh 

81.32 82.32 B: (( um )) 

82.59 92.29 B: i i i still am onto the belief that you know if anyone is willing you know whether it's bioterrorism or any act of terrorism if someone's willing 

92.68 93.62 B: ah 

93.67 97.97 B: to give their life for their cause or whatever it is they're trying to do that it's 

98.54 103.72 B: it's very hard to prevent and i guess the best thing we can do is just to try to um 

100.09 101.63 A: yeah 

104.38 112.84 B: you know do do as much as you can to prevent it you know ah with you know security and everything um 

110.91 111.87 A: (( hm right )) 

113.19 123.54 B: i guess as ridiculous and tight as it is these days as compared to you know i mean even a couple of years ago never mind you know ten twenty years ago 

123.21 134.76 A: [mn] right yeah yeah when they ah when you can't ah worry scaring with the law then they're up to that stage like you said with you know willing to give their life up for it to 

125.67 126.46 B: so 

134.98 140.30 A: and sorta makes it steps over that bounds to make it a lot harder to prevent [laughter] 

141.19 142.56 B: yeah i 

143.41 144.76 B: definitely ah 

144.77 145.97 B: seem to agree
