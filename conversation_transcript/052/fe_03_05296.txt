0.75 3.49 B: hello my name is peter hamon 

7.15 9.94 A: hello my name is ben ostrowski 

8.45 9.60 B: (( oh yes )) 

17.01 20.55 A: this is my first call i don't know do do you wanna start 

17.95 18.76 B: (( go )) 

21.17 24.60 B: (( [laughter] go ahead [laughter] i'm sorry )) 

24.03 33.93 A: oh gosh well um [sigh] i don't know a whole about bioterrorism but it it seems like [mn] it's not a matter of preventing things it's you know i think 

24.76 45.05 B: (( right )) 

34.04 45.68 A: ah there's gonna be an attack at some point um you know whether ah i think maybe you could say there already has been that that loony who was mailing out the anthrax stuff 

44.93 48.81 B: you're right okay 

48.98 50.34 B: um 

50.62 61.51 B: and like you i do agree that something is gonna happen i don't know if it's gonna be bioterrorism but i got the feeling like something is gonna happen and um 

61.28 65.99 B: my only concern is that you know are we ready you know which i 

66.70 71.36 B: don't feel too comfortable to say that we are but um 

70.48 76.89 A: yeah i guess you'd have to think about where you're gonna see the most damages i think 

71.39 106.81 B: (( right okay )) 

76.89 86.73 A: what i've s- what i've seen online and read generally is that most of the damage caused by ah a bioterror attack 

86.73 92.50 A: is by affecting a community so hard that the local hospitals can't treat people 

92.38 103.33 A: you know it may just be really high fevers or something like that but if everybody in a city has a really high fever there just isn't enough medicine to go around there isn't enough 

103.34 106.84 A: facilities for the people who are old or sick or what have you 

106.82 115.42 B: right yeah a big breakdown i could s- yeah that would be that's a scary situation uh yeah whoa [noise] [noise] [noise] 

114.80 121.38 A: maybe if the government started up some more clinics where people could get health care generally 

115.77 153.25 B: (( right right that that that would be better )) 

121.48 126.40 A: ah you know if if we had some more doctors' offices if we had 

126.54 135.38 A: ah you know i know somebody who's a nurse and he's still paying his s- school bills after like twenty years 

135.77 139.13 A: maybe if the government was um 

139.14 142.79 A: putting together some facilities where you can just say 

143.00 156.94 A: you know okay i'm a doctor i'll work here for ten years you pay me a decent salary and wipe out my bills you know or something like that and then we'd have more doctors out there waiting to to treat people 

154.37 163.77 B: that's true yeah that's a pretty point it would be you know you're right about those student loans it's ha- 

163.75 172.34 B: took me a while to pay mine back [laughter] um but that's a great idea though that is just a a great idea you know 

165.90 167.16 A: yeah 

172.88 179.42 B: maybe they could probably do it with all fields you know teachers teach for a couple of years to pay back their loan you know 

178.79 179.77 A: mhm 

179.53 190.50 B: yeah that's a great idea yeah 

180.91 190.57 A: i just [laughter] i just worry about what they're going to do now that um you know they got all this new technology to to keep track of things 

190.30 203.52 B: (( yeah yeah yeah it )) 

190.58 192.18 A: you know ah i 

192.22 202.15 A: if somebody gets sick in my city am i gonna have to like stay in my house or is there gonna be army guys running around with machine guns saying stay in your house 

203.46 206.66 B: could break down f- it could break down mm 

206.74 216.03 B: there's a lot of possibilities yeah you know and um i catch the subway to work you know i live in d._c. and i catch the subway to work and and af- ah 

212.64 213.93 A: mhm 

216.80 220.09 B: i'm just thinking that would be a perfect place you know 

220.09 221.33 A: oh yeah 

220.67 222.96 B: if they wanted to just you know 

223.01 230.16 B: like go in the the mains heart of it like metro center and just you know drop something that's airborne you know 

230.37 234.30 A: yeah and that's that's why they've got a bunch of sensors in there 

230.47 235.73 B: yeah oh they do they got sens- 

234.95 237.10 A: oh yeah yeah 

235.86 236.89 B: okay 

237.21 240.66 A: that's probably the first place they put it that and new york 

240.30 241.37 B: okay 

241.27 245.70 A: so yeah f- if there was anything funny in the air in ah 

245.72 248.96 A: in the metro i think you'd know about it pretty fast 

248.71 250.32 B: okay 

250.75 252.48 A: or at least somebody would 

252.45 267.39 B: hopefully yeah [laughter] right okay 

254.02 265.96 A: but i mean they they can find ah y- they could detect weird chemicals they might be able to detect see i don't think we can detect a particular disease floating around in the air 

268.00 274.25 B: like the what's that ebola virus or something somebody could walk with that and unleash that or something 

271.24 272.51 A: yeah 

273.54 285.95 A: yeah i mean if there's a known chemical uh i don't think there's that many different kind of poison gas that people would use you know if we know what we're expecting then you could build a a machine that would sniff for that 

275.70 287.02 B: (( yeah right yeah okay )) 

286.15 290.09 A: but a virus is a lot more complicated than just a chemical 

290.20 303.98 B: (( yeah oh man okay i see what you're saying )) 

292.93 294.73 A: and then you got you know 

294.76 301.60 A: somebody comes down with a new kind of a cold and he gets locked up for trying to spread bioterror or something like that 

303.74 306.68 A: i just worry n- [sigh] i don't know 

307.44 317.34 B: yeah it's it did- didn't they what kind of they used some kinda was that a virus that they used in china when they put it in um metro s- in ah subway system 

317.45 323.71 A: oh i think um i think a cult in tokyo used some poison gas 

323.25 324.63 B: oh okay 

324.35 327.38 A: is that what you're talking about aum aum shinrikyo 

325.35 327.63 B: yeah yeah 

327.75 328.88 A: yeah 

329.18 342.96 B: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

329.88 336.34 A: yeah and they weren't even very good at it and they trained for it you know the had the box full of it and this 

336.38 343.49 A: this guy starts poking the box with an umbrella with a knife on it or something like that and you know 

342.95 344.52 B: (( oh man )) 

343.95 346.90 A: they had the perfect opportunity and they messed it up 

347.07 357.79 B: (( yeah yup )) 

349.03 358.55 A: i mean what i've what i've learned basically is that most things most kinds of attacks just make you leave the area alone 

358.28 359.46 B: (( hm )) 

358.86 362.27 A: you know if if somebody nukes d._c. 

359.29 376.68 B: (( mhm yeah that's right )) 

362.34 371.97 A: well then you have to build a new capital somewhere else 'cause you're not gonna be able to clean it up really you know if somebody sprays some awful chemical all over d._c. 

371.99 373.71 A: you know ah 

374.17 376.56 A: [laughter] not counting the metro buses 

376.47 377.00 B: (( yeah )) 

376.93 378.08 A: [laughter] then 

377.39 390.28 B: (( right [laughter] right )) 

378.12 380.34 A: um 

380.79 384.25 A: [lipsmack] you just have to leave the area until you clean it 

384.52 387.66 A: but ah the bioterror thing you know it 

387.94 391.93 A: you gotta lock everybody down i guess in order to control it 

390.15 394.82 B: yeah so it won't spread yeah 

392.82 393.81 A: yeah 

395.21 396.16 B: (( mm )) 

396.01 404.17 A: i don't know i think maybe you teach teach more science in the schools and people will will have a better idea you know 

401.86 404.00 B: (( yeah )) 

403.99 415.96 B: yeah yeah right 

404.33 405.55 A: so they won't 

405.61 414.85 A: they won't say oh i got a virus i better take some cipro you know and then you find out that cipro's mostly good against bacteria which is something else entirely 

414.93 415.88 A: (( you know )) 

415.97 419.57 B: won't do you any good to take it you know [laughter] 

417.59 418.68 A: yeah 

419.69 425.24 B: hm at one point that's what they were giving out a lot in d._c. they were you know they 

425.09 436.08 B: when the anthrax was out people was thinking that they might be infected so they was going you know and they was giving everybody anybody came in there they gave 'em that you know that's what i 

435.19 441.67 A: oh yeah my uncle was taking that for a while 'cause he works for the postal service he works in the building where the 

441.73 445.57 A: the the new jersey building where they think the guy mailed the letters from 

445.13 447.38 B: (( oh man )) 

445.74 447.92 A: or where it went through or something 

447.61 448.57 B: mm 

449.14 456.46 A: so he was wearing all kinds of fun suits showing it showing everybody okay then the mail goes from this machine to that machine 

451.59 457.24 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

456.79 460.64 A: and they're still cleaning it up they still haven't opened that building up again 

460.73 462.68 B: (( dang that's the same with the the )) 

462.83 467.86 B: (( down you know i don't think this one is open ah ah i'll be ca- i don't think it is open though )) 

467.16 469.79 A: (( hm )) 

469.80 471.45 B: yeah 

471.87 474.18 B: it's wow 

473.84 478.45 A: and of course for a a while you didn't even have anybody opening their mail 

478.15 489.89 B: yep you're right [laughter] for the first time i mean people don't want bills anyway but yeah yup 

478.74 479.63 A: you know 

480.56 481.41 A: so you 

481.69 488.56 A: you write a letter to your congressman and say hey knock this nonsense off and they're never gonna open it 

490.98 504.36 B: they um the the i noticed the hart building and all that stuff though they they kinda opened them pretty quickly i mean it i'm not saying they didn't take any time but yeah the ah the um the hart building and the um 

498.31 500.26 A: what is that the senate building 

504.46 518.90 B: what was it yeah it was the hart building and the what's that connected to the hart is the dirksen yeah okay it's the um it's w- it's on um the house side of the hill 

511.16 512.58 A: oh i don't know that one 

517.63 521.80 A: okay so that's that's where all the junior reps have their offices 

520.34 529.91 B: right right so they you know they they opened them up fairly you know those those those buildings have a underground rail- ah 

522.00 522.97 A: okay 

529.82 542.25 B: train subway train you know it goes from those buildings to the it go from the house side of the capitol to the senate side of the capitol yeah and it goes to the capitol too you know so 

538.61 539.66 A: really 

542.02 551.46 B: if it was something airborne the silly man could've spread it from one of those [laughter] i mean he just could've went through the tunnels it seemed like you know but they only creamed one building so 

548.78 550.10 A: well yeah 

550.43 556.26 A: i mean you know you'd think somebody would carry it into a common place and then it would go from there 

554.20 558.83 B: (( yeah yeah so it's )) 

558.47 560.74 A: (( hm )) 

558.87 563.17 B: it's a lot to think about hm mm 

560.92 562.24 A: yeah it's 

562.27 565.42 A: and it's tough to think about what to do ahead of time 

565.16 583.85 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

565.78 577.13 A: i know i've got some computers that are running a program that helps find um some sort of cure for smallpox or inoculation or i i forget what it is 

577.26 584.21 A: um but basically it just goes through we know what smallpox looks like we know the structure 

583.75 599.90 B: (( mhm )) 

584.19 592.52 A: and so it just tries to imagine every possible chemical in the universe and see- sees okay well what does this do to smallpox 

592.61 599.90 A: and if it finds something that works well together ah then it says oh okay well let's let's let the scientists look at this one
