0.00 1.24 B: i'm jonathan simpson 

0.80 2.29 A: oh hi i'm 

4.04 5.32 B: [laughter] how ya 

5.04 6.37 A: good thank you 

6.56 7.77 A: how are you 

7.03 8.81 B: (( doing um i'm doing )) 

8.97 12.73 A: okay so what are we supposed to spend time on 

12.64 24.73 B: all right uh we need to figure out which of these uh personal habits is the worst uh gossiping smoking drinking alcohol or caffeine excessively overeating or not exercising [laughter] 

24.46 26.53 A: oh okay [laughter] 

25.87 28.13 B: so i don't know um 

28.87 36.40 B: i don't know i guess we'll hit each 'em uh one by one and see what you think about it and i'll tell you what i think about it and then kinda move on and see if we can determine what we 

33.37 34.78 A: okay sure 

36.07 36.96 A: sure 

36.42 40.10 B: come to an agreement on so as far as gossiping what do you think about that 

39.41 48.04 A: okay just uh just to um uh interpret you like i got a uh message that we were supposed to talk about reality shows or that 

47.56 49.53 B: is that what your topic said 

48.92 49.71 A: yeah 

49.93 55.23 B: hm must be something weird with the system 'cause i got the topic of the day is being uh 

55.03 55.80 A: oh 

55.58 58.15 B: did did they just tell it to you on the phone right now 

57.41 62.72 A: yes yes yes but anyway we can talk about your topic that's that's okay [laughter] i don't care 

58.69 59.81 B: hm 

61.91 69.08 B: [laughter] all right it doesn't matter um all right so i guess the first one is uh gossiping what do you think about that 

67.55 69.61 A: (( yeah uh )) 

70.14 74.80 A: well uh difficult question what i mean which which one is um 

74.37 76.41 B: which one is uh worse 

75.90 77.91 A: oh which one is worse 

78.27 80.95 A: uh some i mean it depends on how you 

80.91 95.78 A: uh how you define gossiping that sometimes you know we gossip and uh we kind of get to know something we never knew before you know we kind of stray aside and go to a particular point you know and then 

96.27 99.91 A: we kind of know things from also being uh told but uh 

100.19 107.03 A: let's say if the person at the time is uh you know arrested but uh i would think something 

107.30 115.18 A: we get out of it uh even a little thing that uh helps a person's life whatever so how would you mhm 

114.10 118.76 B: yeah i agree i think uh as far as gossiping is concerned um 

119.13 131.93 B: i don't know it it seems like it's the only one on this entire list uh that might actually you know hurt somebody else rather than yourself everything else seems to be that you know you're just doing bad things to yourself drinking alcohol excessively smoking 

132.17 140.22 B: overeating or not exercising those are all like personal things that you do to yourself but as far as gossiping though that can you know that kind of involves other people so you 

139.32 141.42 A: mhm yep yep oh yeah that's true yep yep 

140.58 145.79 B: know that's that's the only thing i was thinking about that um the next one is uh smoking 

142.79 143.50 A: (( yep )) 

145.03 146.22 A: okay 

146.36 148.44 A: smoking um 

149.17 155.34 A: well you harm yourself and you can harm others by by passive smoking right so 

155.97 162.88 A: uh let's say you're a woman and pregnant and you're smoking so you harm the baby too and stuff like that so yep yep 

162.52 166.65 B: yeah that's that's true um the other thing is is it also 

166.66 170.48 B: i think the other things on the list uh including smoking can harm 

170.61 177.91 B: you know people who care about you family members and things you know whenever you're doing anything detrimental to yourself um but that is a good point as far as uh 

177.96 179.33 B: you know um 

179.42 183.15 B: secondhand smoke and things like that you know people a lotta the times don't 

183.21 186.28 B: uh acknowledge other people when they're smoking um 

186.03 187.50 A: (( yep yep yep )) 

186.67 190.20 B: let's see uh drinking alcohol excessively 

190.57 192.33 A: mm so 

193.07 197.52 A: uh it's probably less harmful than smoking 

197.37 202.41 B: yeah probably uh it it takes a longer time i'm sure for uh it to really 

198.68 199.73 A: um 

202.46 216.93 B: i don't know it's one of those habits that sometimes you know i think it depends on whether or not you have a problem with it as far as if you drink excessively on the weekends or something or if it's something that you do and it starts interfering with your personal relationships and your uh your work 

208.18 209.94 A: yeah but i think 

214.66 216.20 A: yeah yeah yeah 

216.31 229.45 A: i think excessive that term is important because once i mean one shot a day probably is good for the heart or something like that like you know one one wine a day one glass of wine a day is probably okay but excessive um 

229.40 237.43 A: yeah it depends you know like what you do after you drink excessively do you sit quiet and curl up in a corner of the room or do you 

237.47 245.33 A: uh hamper other other activities or um uh do you d- disturb other people or how how you react 

245.51 250.57 A: to other people that matters right i mean yeah yeah mhm 

249.64 261.34 B: yeah yeah i agree with that completely uh just as an interesting side comment i've al- also read some things uh they have said like one glass of wine um can be good for the heart a day um but they've also 

261.37 268.18 B: um i mean define it as as one you know drink of wine rather than you know a shot of liquor or something like that 

267.28 268.77 A: (( mhm yeah yeah )) 

268.14 277.60 B: can be more beneficial but they've said that that might be true because the people who drink wine maybe one glass a day or something are the kind of people who also eat healthy 

277.19 279.97 A: (( mhm mhm yeah yeah yeah probably yeah yeah that's )) 

278.48 285.78 B: they're you know just from a higher category of people so you know they're not sure if it's the wine or not i don't know but um 

280.90 282.01 A: (( true yep yep )) 

284.66 286.09 A: yeah yeah yeah 

285.96 289.08 B: as far as drinking caffeine excessively what do ya think 

287.72 289.37 A: (( yeah um )) 

290.32 295.51 A: okay how excessive uh is excessive i mean how how big is excessive how large is excessive 

294.15 297.39 B: yeah i think it's definitely we have to define that term 

296.91 309.05 A: yeah because normally i would drink um just a mug of coffee a day i mean that's there but uh some people drink you know every hour in my in my workplace so 

309.17 316.41 A: um i don't know like caffeine is there in tea coffee um maybe chocolates right so mm 

316.03 319.03 B: yeah yeah and also you know coke and uh 

317.81 321.91 A: yeah yeah coke yeah yeah sure coke yeah yeah 

320.02 321.74 B: coca-cola and all that stuff 

321.73 333.13 B: i used to drink caffeine extremely excessively and it got to the point to where i was feeling pretty crappy at the end of the day um but you know when i was drinking it it was all right but the problem is when you stop drinking it 

332.34 334.38 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

333.08 342.57 B: and uh so i quit drinking coffee for that reason but you know like my dad you know he drinks probably maybe a pot a day or something you know and he doesn't seem to have any problem with it so 

341.95 349.65 A: mm mm mm mm i think if if you do have a habit and you can't you know you can't uh get rid of it that's bad because 

342.87 344.06 B: i don't know 

348.87 351.88 B: yeah i think with all these things that's probably true 

349.82 357.93 A: you'll have headaches and stuff like that so that's that's all if you're under under control it should be okay yeah 

357.15 359.07 B: what about overeating 

358.75 361.65 A: (( uh [laughter] i like to overeat )) 

361.59 362.82 B: [laughter] 

361.86 370.22 A: i mean but the thing is you know like my system i have a good digestive system like even if i overeat it won't stick to me so 

370.01 371.79 B: yeah it's the same with me 

370.40 377.90 A: i mean okay i eat a lot i do eat a lot a lot of junk food whatever food i get i can grab my hands on i eat but 

378.10 384.17 A: yeah it depends because i think i do exercise also like i play soccer and stuff like that so if you 

384.80 387.88 A: balance it out with exercise it doesn't really matter 

388.17 392.95 B: yeah i'm fairly young and so my metabolism is pretty quick as well 

388.41 389.28 A: but 

392.89 403.69 B: so i don't seem to kinda have that i i have tried to eat more healthy um in the past you know not as much junk food and stuff and it's a lot more and believe it or not i think probably you know 

404.03 404.88 A: yeah 

404.13 411.29 B: eating some canned soup or something with preservatives and things like that is probably worse than going out to a a nice restaurant and just 

411.13 424.51 B: you know [laughter] stuffing yourself and at least it's you know good quality food and you're not dealing with all the the preservatives and things like that um seems to be all you know a lotta people that the higher cancer rates and things like in america 

414.64 415.56 A: (( mhm yep )) 

417.78 419.14 A: mhm 

424.17 425.35 A: yeah yeah 

424.54 429.56 B: rather than other countries due to the amount of preservatives we have in all the food and stuff so [lipsmack] 

428.75 430.67 A: yeah yeah yeah 

429.82 430.64 B: um 

430.84 438.53 B: and then uh i guess the last one here is uh is exercising or um let's see hold on not exercising i well let me check 

438.60 441.62 B: i can refer back to this topic list here 

440.83 444.65 A: so did you uh write down these or did you have time to write these down 

443.64 447.83 B: i'm i'm looking at the the topics on the internet right now um 

447.21 448.23 A: (( oh okay )) 

448.06 450.89 B: not exercising is is the last one 

450.44 451.90 A: oh okay so 

451.96 454.25 A: are the topics there on the internet 

454.00 458.74 B: yeah they're they're listed on the the fisher website project website there's a list there 

457.24 460.44 A: oh oh okay i didn't know that okay i just heard yeah okay 

459.56 460.63 B: but um 

460.82 465.25 B: let's see i don't know how much time we got so not exercising would probably 

466.04 473.72 B: i don't know that's that's one of those things that i think is probably not very high on the list as far as uh as you know being 

473.78 476.24 B: uh worse for you or something you know 'cause 

475.45 476.78 A: mhm 

476.35 488.49 B: i don't know that all does go in conjunction with overeating um you know and kinda those other personal habits exercising is something that can kinda counteract some of the bad effects of some of the things we talked about 

488.12 489.16 A: yeah 

488.55 500.75 B: um but it's not something that's you know if you don't do as long as your other habits are all right you know a moderate amount of exercise uh just that you get you know in a regular day i think is probably sufficient so 

493.09 494.96 A: yeah yeah yeah 

500.07 504.12 A: yeah i think um most of us i mean who are 

504.29 508.55 A: regular exercisers they do really good but uh i mean 

508.83 512.69 A: like i don't use any machine or anything like that but i 

512.77 526.38 A: walk a lot like at least walk around you know do i mean let's say i do gardening and lawn mowing and snow snow plowing and all those things probably are much more strenuous than you know sitting on the machine or riding on a 

526.82 528.98 A: treadmill and stuff like that so um 

528.79 532.82 B: oh i agree completely i think too uh they've also proven that 

532.90 547.68 B: you know half an hour worth of brisk walking will do just as good for you as running you know uh doing that every day is just as good as as running two miles every day uh especially in your older age that you really don't need a ton of it and to go completely crazy and especially with you know 

540.79 541.83 A: yep 

542.48 543.59 A: yep 

544.70 545.57 A: mhm 

547.50 560.52 B: well it's a global thing but especially in america the whole fitness gym and that whole industry is is just exploding because people think that they can just go crazy with it and if they do then it's gonna counteract all their other habits 

560.52 561.30 A: yep 

560.71 563.87 B: so what do you think is worst like the worst outta that whole list 

563.94 570.34 A: mm uh okay they want to um worst to yourself or worst for community or 

570.45 571.27 A: (( worst )) 

570.63 579.12 B: i think they don't really specify i think you can you can pick one or the other i mean if you wanna say something's worse for yourself than anything and 

572.85 574.00 A: okay 

578.43 584.63 A: yeah i would say smoking is the worst um to yourself you can do 

584.90 586.67 A: out of this um 

587.11 591.92 A: then probably would come excessive drinking but um 

592.00 593.82 A: (( worse for others )) 

595.07 596.11 A: uh 

596.76 599.89 A: i don't know what to say like how you can uh
