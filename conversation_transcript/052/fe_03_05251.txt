31.22 33.30 A: [laughter] 

32.59 33.54 B: (( [laughter] )) 

33.68 34.88 B: but uh 

34.98 38.46 B: uh what did it say it was what do you find more 

38.81 49.92 B: uh offensive like smoking um [lipsmack] or reading lack of exercise excessive cussing cursing 

44.40 45.92 A: smoking 

48.46 50.70 A: drinking 

50.52 57.65 B: um or there was a couple of others in there uh other ones there that were more favorable to me are you still there 

55.63 57.03 A: right 

57.39 59.06 A: yeah 

58.01 63.15 B: okay there's a couple more in there that were more favorable to me i can't think of can you you know what they were 

63.07 65.87 A: uh i think one of them was drinking 

67.35 69.08 A: (( and )) 

69.29 75.27 B: yeah yeah but oh the first one anyway it might come to it might come to me oh gossiping 

74.82 78.38 A: gossip that's it yeah 

75.98 80.08 B: yeah uh personally i find uh 

80.10 81.90 B: i can handle smoking 

82.10 83.65 B: i can handle drinking 

84.10 85.31 B: um 

84.10 85.84 A: mhm 

86.20 88.32 B: i mean in other people 

88.37 99.74 B: well to to a point but like uh gossiping is kind of the thing that kinda sticks to me i was actually thinking about it at work today i worked with a bunch of uh guys that i never worked with before 

100.02 103.53 B: so i was kind of like the outsider but you know working on a certain crew 

103.75 109.62 B: and all took lunch and i sat a nearby table and i was just noticing how people just talk crap at each other 

103.93 105.64 A: right 

109.32 111.01 A: yeah 

110.13 118.68 B: and not at each other but about other people behind their back and i just find it to be complete- completely useless and damaging 

114.19 115.24 A: right 

118.36 120.14 A: right 

120.34 121.81 B: so um 

120.34 121.33 A: (( yeah )) 

121.92 122.96 B: (( uh )) 

123.39 126.11 B: for me that's like one of the one of the most uh uh 

126.87 129.75 B: hurtful of of these uh of these uh 

129.78 133.04 B: things that uh the service has listed 

131.40 139.96 A: mhm yeah it seems like most people have been doing it for so long they don't even realize what they're doing 

133.92 135.32 B: (( so uh )) 

139.39 152.60 B: right it has psychological you know implications too like uh you know people often talk down about other people just so that they can like you know deflect uh attention from their own flaws 

152.44 155.00 A: right uh-huh 

152.65 158.74 B: and what have you and i think if people investigated those things more then the world might be a better place 

158.36 159.56 A: [laughter] 

159.46 164.75 B: you know and personally i could indulge in this conversation with you face to face having a cigarette and a beer 

164.72 166.58 A: [laughter] 

165.94 166.83 B: (( you know )) 

166.87 167.95 A: (( right you )) 

167.42 168.73 B: maybe a few 

169.53 175.60 B: so um well how 'bout you 'bout those those uh those topics that they uh that they uh picked out 

176.10 177.62 A: know what uh 

178.73 186.74 A: i don't really have a really big problem with any of 'em but i guess smoking is one of my pet peeves though 

188.32 190.04 B: (( yep )) 

189.59 192.14 A: just when people smoke around me it's kinda 

191.37 193.31 B: (( i think that are you still there )) 

193.04 194.71 A: yeah 

193.71 197.87 B: okay cool i just switched over to speakerphone 'cause i think my uh 

194.80 196.43 A: sorry did i fade out 

198.26 201.15 B: my phone battery was dying in my hand- my handheld 

201.04 202.62 A: oh okay 

202.43 203.56 B: but uh 

204.08 205.07 B: uh 

205.55 212.06 B: [noise] yeah but you know it's cool to investigate all those things like you know like take the drinking for example drinking uh 

212.17 218.43 B: uh is fine you know like i was just saying if you and i were sitting down having a couple of beers that's fine having an interesting conversation 

218.32 229.59 B: but you know it's like when drinking uh is is like brought home and it's taken to excess and then it becomes uh abusive and people get abusive to each other then then then then we have got issues you know 

229.22 231.07 A: right 

231.22 234.13 A: right personally i 

234.16 243.96 A: i prefer not drinking or smoking just because of how i was raised so i'm just a little more sensitive to that but i don't it never 

240.13 241.44 B: yeah 

243.82 249.74 A: ceases to amaze me how much gossip there is around me though and it just bugs the the bejesus out of me 

249.63 251.43 B: yeah does it uh 

251.46 255.61 B: you mean directed towards you or just you hear people talking about other people all around you 

255.25 258.14 A: just hear people talking about everyone 

258.54 262.36 A: they don't ev- they don't even realize what they're doing they don't realize it's damaging 

258.57 259.72 B: yeah 

262.46 272.28 B: yeah and it uh serves no real uh real uh useful purpose i mean like you know like if i had some sort of uh problem with you 

272.59 273.66 B: uh 

273.67 287.91 B: if i'm gonna come home and talk to my girlfriend about you being your back right well it doesn't really serve any useful function if i really want to get to the heart of the matter i should take it to some to to someone that that uh 

287.92 299.65 B: so something can be done about it like you know if there's a problem then why not just come to you and say hey listen i've got this uh i you know something you said really bothered me or whatever it it might've been and take it up with you and just have a 

288.29 291.17 A: (( right )) 

299.84 304.04 B: a conversation where you could like clear clear the space a little bit you know 

303.84 304.70 A: right 

304.45 310.84 B: and uh and get on with it but you know gossiping uh stuff is just uh it's useless 

306.29 307.37 A: right 

311.46 324.87 A: right and like smoking and drinking it's really physical and it's really easy to see what happens from that but gossiping it's just so subtle they don't they don't even realize when anything's happening 

320.52 321.92 B: (( right )) 

324.28 326.90 B: yeah yeah it's true 

327.25 330.38 B: but you know by the same token i understand like uh 

330.97 332.18 B: (( [lipsmack] uh )) 

332.59 335.25 B: like the whole secondhand smoke uh 

335.51 342.95 B: uh business you know they've found it's scientifically proven that secondhand smoke is is damaging to uh 

343.24 349.44 B: people who don't smoke so you know if i'm a smoker which i am 

344.78 345.97 A: right 

349.73 355.30 B: um i could respect that you know i don't want my smoke getting all over in peoples uh space 

355.24 356.27 A: mhm 

355.65 367.51 B: but at the same time i don't want that right taken away from me if i wanna do it in my own space or outdoors or something then you know i should be able to indulge in that but uh yeah i could see it as being a pretty uh 

363.35 365.06 A: (( right )) 

368.00 373.32 B: it can be viewed as a pretty foul pretty foul habit 

372.98 375.99 A: mhm 

375.38 376.85 B: so and uh 

377.12 381.16 B: overeating you know i don't really understand overeating too much 

382.43 387.36 B: 'cause i'm uh kind of on the lean side you know i could eat anything and not gain weight 

385.23 386.81 A: [laughter] 

387.50 389.34 B: so people tell me i'm lucky 

389.52 390.69 A: yeah 

390.11 392.01 B: uh uh 

392.53 405.50 B: i've never understood the whole overeating thing i've never really investigated it you know like i know uh i've read things about people who are like excessive like obese people for example when they were growing up uh were always given uh 

405.61 412.66 B: you know little sweet treats and stuff as a reward for doing something good so they just got accustomed to that little it became like a comfort zone 

412.76 420.65 B: and they never were able to give that up so as a result they became obese in adulthood and then lived to regret it 

420.26 421.21 A: uh-huh 

421.09 423.55 B: suffer all kinds of psychological uh 

423.74 425.92 B: damage because of that you know 

425.61 427.36 A: right 

426.37 427.46 B: um 

427.83 431.75 B: but it's an interesting thing i've never really looked at it beyond 

432.53 434.30 B: what i just said really 

435.15 443.32 A: yeah yeah and then probably in about the past coup- past year also i've kind of become a health nut 

442.96 444.15 B: (( good for you )) 

443.70 445.06 A: [laughter] 'cause uh 

445.08 446.82 A: i'm not so lean 

446.90 448.99 A: and so it kinda sticks on me 

448.67 450.03 B: yeah 

448.87 463.45 A: and so i've i've heard about what some people do and i've kind of put my own plan where i for breakfast i'll eat anything anything i can basically and then lunch we'll just keep it moderate and we'll have a light dinner 

463.35 464.77 B: yeah 

463.78 465.41 A: (( 'cause you know )) 

465.60 474.53 A: usually i eat my dinners pretty late and so i'm not doing anything after it so why do i need all the calories and everything it's just gonna sit and grow on me 

471.31 472.55 B: exactly 

473.81 475.37 B: yeah it will 

475.94 480.91 B: yeah my girlfriend and i have been indulging in uh like organic foods lately 

480.55 481.43 A: uh-huh 

481.68 494.89 B: and like investigating that like going on the internet and and uh finding out all kinds of incredible information and then supporting like local farmers rather than going to like the main supermarkets to buy carrots and what have you we go to farmers' markets 

495.03 496.32 B: and uh 

496.51 498.96 B: uh just really got into it you know 

498.69 500.04 A: mhm 

499.45 504.55 B: so you know it's uh you start putting really good uh good nutrients in your body and uh 

504.71 514.70 B: i don't know if its psychological or superficial or it's like a placebo effect but uh i seem to well i think that i feel better maybe that's good enough 

512.90 515.83 A: [laughter] right 

515.22 521.58 B: [laughter] i don't know if the the the actual reality is that i am doing better things for my body but you know 

521.67 523.93 B: it makes me feel like i'm doing something good for it 

521.91 523.65 A: (( mhm )) 

523.87 526.27 A: yeah 

526.19 527.75 B: yeah what uh 

527.76 530.26 B: what else was there on that little list there 

529.43 532.04 A: i have no idea [laughter] 

531.65 535.45 B: this is the second time i've done i've done this is this your first call on this service 

535.03 536.72 A: yeah 

535.75 537.47 B: yeah it's it's something else 

538.04 540.32 B: so how did you hear about it 

539.70 547.37 A: uh i have a friend at work who did it and they just gave me the number referred me to it 

544.03 544.84 B: (( ah )) 

546.91 555.03 B: yeah i just got an email from a friend saying hey man here's a cool way of making some money i mean not that you'll be making so much money i think you get to do it three times 

554.41 556.93 A: yeah yeah but 

555.85 558.00 B: or something like that but uh 

557.51 559.16 A: it's pretty easy though 

558.94 569.06 B: yeah it's easy and and uh it you know it's for some sort of scientific study and i'd be real curious to see what the outcome of that is so i was willing i was willing to support that 

565.87 567.57 A: right 

569.32 570.96 A: yeah 

569.68 574.67 B: yeah you know i'd support it even if it wasn't paying but don't don't tell them that
