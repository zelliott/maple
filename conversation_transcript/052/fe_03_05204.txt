280.81 286.29 B: mhm right that i'm i'm familiar with that chain too i don't eat there that much because i'm a vegetarian 

280.87 282.82 A: uh restaurant 

283.30 284.71 A: yeah 

286.16 294.12 A: yeah yeah that that makes it tough too in a sense you know when you go out to eat you gotta be careful there you know in a sense to uh 

292.74 298.52 B: well i'm not a fanatic about it but i definitely don't partake in max and irma's too much 

298.33 307.56 A: yeah [laughter] i'll i'll be honest i i've never been in there and i'm probably uh i could walk there probably in fifteen minutes 

305.68 308.33 B: my understanding was that's a steakhouse 

308.36 311.46 A: yeah we have the steakhouse so 

312.52 316.96 A: let me say there was the long horn we have that and the uh 

317.13 317.96 B: mhm 

317.32 322.15 A: oh i can't think of it all i can think is outback or something like that 

321.30 327.28 B: yeah the outback is a big one i mean there's all sorts of ones but outback is a big one 

323.14 325.03 A: (( yeah )) 

325.35 327.29 A: (( yeah )) 

327.52 329.79 B: i've been there it's pretty good 

329.25 335.19 A: yeah now they have another if you're into buffets the uh old country buffet 

334.96 339.68 B: mhm i didn't like the old country buffet i thought the food was kind a greasy 

339.43 340.87 A: uh 

341.31 347.47 B: i've only eaten there once though i mean sure you've got i mean you have tons of food you know

346.59 349.51 A: oh yeah yeah yeah they uh 

348.31 350.98 B: but um i didn't really think it was all that tasty 

350.94 363.74 A: yeah the beef uh i've been there when they had the uh roast beef and they had roast turkey and the times and uh that wasn't too bad but then like you say some of the other some of the other foods you're right their chicken was uh 

364.20 368.23 A: like a deep fried de- deal and i don't like that 

365.60 366.43 B: mhm 

367.64 371.09 B: well the situation i have is that i live by myself 

370.65 372.23 A: uh oh okay 

371.45 373.30 B: and when you live by yourself 

373.50 378.13 B: and you're going to cook and by cook i mean not just heat something up 

378.15 383.84 B: it's kind of limited because it most meals that you make you really can't make it as a 

384.12 388.42 B: you know one person meal so you have to have something that you can make in a relatively 

388.65 396.19 B: you know large quantity that will keep or you have to be in a situation where you're inviting people over 

395.52 403.23 A: right yes like you say you could make up a meal and uh and have a freezer type yeah 

400.40 401.52 B: like i make la-

420.92 435.14 B: well my aunt cooks a lot she's a really excellent cook and she really enjoys it so she i mean she eats out sometimes but she really gets a lot of psychic satisfaction out of cooking i mean she just really enjoys it 

435.44 440.23 B: but that's not me [laughter] i mean i don't mind cooking 

440.47 445.75 B: but um i certainly am quite happy to eat out all things being equal 

445.59 452.96 A: yeah once you find you know find a good places to eat that's uh now i don't know if they have a applebee's down that way
