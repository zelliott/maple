0.22 2.18 A: hi my name is bill 

2.02 3.89 B: hi bill my name is jess 

3.93 5.71 A: hi jess how ya doing 

5.19 6.64 B: good yourself 

6.34 9.40 A: okay ah this is the first time i've done one of these 

9.27 15.07 B: ah it's my first time too i've been turning the calls down last weekend i was really busy so 

10.57 12.67 A: okay um 

15.84 19.97 A: ah so i'm not quite sure to how to proceed i guess we just start 

19.96 23.19 B: i think yeah we're just supposed to chat about the topic 

22.67 23.61 A: okay 

23.61 26.53 B: see how the dynamics of that work out 

23.65 24.76 A: um 

26.12 32.29 A: so the ah [sigh] so the topic is bioterrorism and how the u._s. can prevent it um 

31.31 32.11 B: (( right is )) 

32.57 38.94 A: so ah it th- that's a good one because i i'm not really sure um as far as 

37.92 40.14 B: this something you've thought about much 

40.34 45.00 A: well um just you know within the the realm of 

45.13 47.80 A: other you know terrorist issues 

47.67 48.96 B: right 

47.92 49.36 A: um it's 

50.16 54.14 A: ah ah i guess number one is making sure the borders are secure 

54.37 57.38 A: um but something with that i don't even know 

57.83 63.12 A: no matter how secure you make 'em you're so hoping to that to that problem so 

62.51 64.38 B: yeah 

63.77 67.29 A: i guess the primary thing actually maybe would be 

67.67 73.91 A: ah you know the medical response and coming up with as many antidotes and having them as widely dispersed as possible 

74.65 75.66 A: (( what do you think )) 

75.02 79.43 B: yeah def- definitely um i mean i think there's 

81.90 85.27 B: i don't know that we necessarily can 

86.73 88.35 B: you know prevent 

88.48 91.65 B: somebody from doing something c- really wacky 

91.88 100.97 B: necessarily ahead of time um i don't really particularly worry about that one 'cause even though i know that people have definitely done research in that area it's 

93.37 94.40 A: yeah 

101.00 101.92 B: like 

101.99 108.51 B: there's a a a huge amount of self risk in doing research in that area and so i think it's somewhat self regulating 

105.97 107.04 A: uh-huh [laughter] 

109.23 110.17 B: um 

112.00 116.32 B: but um then my other thing would be a you know 

117.07 130.67 B: it's easy to try to set up a security system to you know prevent somebody from trying to get inside something that they wanna get inside of um but there's definitely another tack you can take which is try to like eliminate the desire to do that 

124.17 125.01 A: yeah 

131.17 134.42 B: and i know that that's a little more like esoteric 

134.69 147.23 B: type of thing to do but i i i don't know i think we'd be more successful at preventing future attacks if we you know prevent them from happening in addition to having like infrastructure in place to to deal with them if they do 

148.22 150.99 A: yeah i think you're right there i mean i think um 

152.18 153.32 A: ah 

153.54 155.51 A: [sigh] e- granted you have the 

155.54 159.95 A: individual person who um i don't really think you you 

160.51 162.65 A: can control that 

162.17 163.26 B: right 

162.63 173.65 A: but when you're involved in political issues or things like that then then if there's any way that you can go to the root causes of that and eliminate that as a desire 

173.62 178.24 A: or eliminate your country as a target and see 

178.33 188.10 A: ah the united states as a proponent of your cause or an aid to your cause rather than a detriment then i think that lessens the possibility of the attack 

188.54 190.33 A: a lot more thoroughly 

190.48 194.92 A: at at least in terms of of organized terrorist organizations 

190.65 191.61 B: right 

195.81 200.65 B: of course then um and mostly playing devil's advocate here when i say that 

200.81 206.41 B: but definitely brings up the idea though that you're giving power to the threat 

207.26 208.38 B: because 

208.86 217.91 B: the the potential of that that danger would potentially sway your politics to try to appease a group that you knew was p- potentially capable of that 

218.22 219.17 B: um 

219.07 226.06 A: yeah but i think that's part of the you know evolution of the political system i mean obviously if there's something that's 

221.53 224.09 B: that's part of the political ah yeah 

226.10 231.00 A: that's causing enough people to be angry enough with you that you're trying to think of ways to kill 

231.89 237.85 A: tens of thousands of people you know in your country then i think you need to examine where you stand anyway 

238.16 239.17 A: um 

239.20 240.80 A: so um 

241.19 243.49 A: ah you know a- and i think it's 

243.31 244.36 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

244.56 246.35 A: ah certainly there's problems 

246.51 251.88 A: in this country that causes domestic ah groups to consider terrorism 

251.57 253.16 B: (( right [noise] )) 

252.35 256.46 A: and there's also you know foreign groups that consider us a target so 

256.18 264.74 B: yeah well i was just gonna say we wheeled you know the other side of that coin ourselves in that you know we certainly 

256.62 257.71 A: (( ah a )) 

265.31 272.10 B: [noise] if necessary use the threat of what you know we're capable of economically and militarily to 

272.23 275.67 B: you know bring other countries in line politically with us 

275.74 279.97 A: oh yeah absolutely yeah um that's ah 

277.92 278.61 B: (( so )) 

280.66 283.75 A: that's a a given i think um 

283.88 293.22 A: but ah [sigh] as far as you know as far as bioterrorism itself i mean specifically um because 

293.77 299.68 A: i i don't know i just think it's just like you said it is sort of self defeating in many ways um 

299.84 303.15 A: ah i think the bigger threat is from some sort of a 

303.38 317.41 A: you know a bomb or something like that i mean that seems to be the the weapon of choice in in like israel and stuff like that i mean they're they're a lot even though we had our own situation with nine eleven ah ah ah they're much more on 

305.73 307.45 B: right 

317.72 327.24 A: every day facing terrorist issues and they've never been subjected to anything like that you know any sort of a bioterrorist type of thing and um 

323.46 324.32 B: (( no )) 

327.88 333.24 A: you know and the ones that have been have not been remarkably successful except like in a military 

333.65 335.23 B: right 

333.82 335.08 A: field you know 

335.34 339.16 A: like mustard gas in world war one or um 

339.66 342.43 A: ah i guess the attack in ah 

342.66 345.82 A: that saddam had against the ira- the ah kurds 

345.75 346.96 B: yeah yeah 

346.09 360.02 A: ah but that's very you know that's that's within very specific conditions and and with the ability to achieve you know overwhelming force at a certain point so it just doesn't really seem 

361.45 363.52 A: that would be our main focus 

364.00 364.89 A: to me 

364.14 366.40 B: no and i guess that's 

367.13 373.82 B: like i know there's you know efforts it's and they talk and do we have enough vaccine and should we just vaccinate everybody you know 

374.03 376.56 B: ultimately we're not gonna to be able to 

376.85 380.08 B: foresee every potential agent that might be used 

379.78 380.69 A: right 

380.13 383.98 B: and it's not worth the risks to to act paranoid 

384.30 386.70 B: at that level i don't think um 

386.88 390.87 A: yeah i i agree with you also i don't think that ah 

390.89 395.12 A: i think if the bigger risk is the is the paranoia and the um 

395.20 404.40 A: you know passage of restrictive laws and and things that just make you think about being in a terrorist situation all the time rather than the actual terrorist situation itself 

405.99 412.69 B: the one thing about it that concerns me a little bit though is that it's such a less controlled ah type of attack 

412.94 417.69 B: that it's not gonna be as immediately necessarily like 

418.76 420.89 B: visible that it's occurred 

420.65 421.69 A: yeah 

421.12 426.24 B: and the targets themselves are gonna be way like a lot more potentially random 

426.76 429.57 B: right like just like a person getting sick somewhere 

429.50 431.21 A: right 

430.38 436.49 B: or since you know oh this was like a large monument so of course they went after it or it was an embassy building or 

436.51 443.44 B: and even like the things that go on in israel like they usually target large public places and stuff but this could you know be a small town 

444.57 445.49 B: um 

445.77 447.32 A: yeah but i mean it's 

447.42 454.59 A: ah [sigh] it's usually ultimately it's a political statement so i think they wanna make the biggest statement they can make 

452.31 453.63 B: right that's this 

453.75 463.60 B: yeah i think the only thing that protects like the common person is that at least right now our enemies seem to be still focused on it being political 

463.99 464.92 B: um 

465.83 470.48 B: the anthrax attack which you know looked like they were probably internal 

470.80 472.56 B: were much more of a 

473.26 476.14 B: a worrisome thing 'cause that was kind of random 

476.95 484.20 A: yeah but again i mean it i mean it seems to be the person that they suspected is ah is ah a highly trained scientist 

477.66 478.47 B: group 

478.49 479.05 B: (( yeah )) 

484.08 485.91 B: yeah 

484.56 490.07 A: and i just don't know i mean they were saying at one point that it was fairly 

490.12 494.29 A: easy for somebody to get access to the stuff and to develop it and stuff but i 

494.32 497.79 A: but apparently the the milling of it or the or the 

498.05 500.93 A: th- the making of it to such a fine level 

501.05 502.21 A: requires 

502.30 506.35 A: quite a bit of scientific knowledge and quite a bit of scientific equipment so 

506.56 511.21 A: again you have a limited number of people can actually do that and then it 

509.80 515.59 B: right and it's easy to track the [noise] [noise] i'm sorry i'm outside 

512.14 513.14 A: yeah 

514.94 520.20 A: oh that's okay and um it's it's ah yeah it's identifiable um 

520.22 526.54 A: and and again even that attack even though it was really scary it was not all that successful you know 

526.63 529.68 A: um aside from the initial people who got it down in 

530.06 531.97 A: down in florida which seemed 

532.70 536.26 A: i don't even know if it was connected you know it just seemed sort of random 

536.65 548.19 A: and then the but the ones in d._c. i mean they they seemed to find it pretty quick and then close it down and sterilize the buildings and stuff and i think the only ones at risk were really the the postal workers and stuff 

547.66 559.01 B: [noise] i i have a question do you feel like we get enough information to make decisions like suppose there was a recommendation from the government you know in ne- next month or so that we all get 

560.24 565.87 B: smallpox vaccinations like would you feel that you had enough information to 

566.26 570.23 B: [noise] like decide if you wanted to go ahead and do that or not 

570.17 578.56 A: [noise] [noise] ah [sigh] you know i don't know i mean i [sigh] i don't know if if like in just day to day medical information it just seems like the way 

578.74 584.04 A: at least the way it's reported that it just seems that so many things come out that are conflicting 

584.10 586.80 A: just about like everything like about like you know 

587.41 599.89 A: everything to to what weight should be and what your blood pressure should be and how much exercise you should get and you know what you should eat and all this stuff it it it always is changes and sometimes you're 

588.73 590.06 B: oh yeah
