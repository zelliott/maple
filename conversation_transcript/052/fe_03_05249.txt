316.05 319.92 A: uh it's just a human nature thing that's what it is 

320.04 326.03 B: i mean personally i think a a worse habit is somebody hey who 

326.18 327.02 B: who 

327.03 336.81 B: drives and uses their cell phone and you know and has a coffee and and doing their hair at the same time

346.57 350.20 A: oh it's it's uh scary you know 

350.82 365.45 A: like our habits like we're talking here are i think are mild compared to some what you just said you know going down the road uh talking on the phone having a coffee there and trying to read the newspaper at the same time or something you know 

364.87 366.68 B: yeah 

365.62 368.87 A: so it uh no i i think uh

370.42 375.42 B: (( we're yeah yeah that's )) 

375.54 384.74 B: [mn] there are a lot of personal habits i would change but then there are when i look at them i they don't seem as 

385.04 390.26 B: as being as bad as as other people's habits 

389.49 398.60 A: right like a drug habit and such uh that could be that could be dangerous to your health that's that's for sure or or somebody else's

410.19 424.80 B: and i didn't have to go through any twelve step program or anything like that but that's what also when i was bartending and and and drinking you know having tons of money in my pocket and not knowing how to spend it 

423.79 431.23 A: right and that's an easy way to do it you know it uh say hey i got the bucks why in the hell not you know 

427.30 429.46 B: yeah 

430.48 432.65 B: mhm 

431.49 433.76 A: uh yeah that's it's

477.56 483.12 A: exactly exactly yep i agree with that a hundred percent 

483.46 489.81 B: and then end up more more addicted and more fucked up than you know what they were when they started 

489.28 493.31 A: exactly because the doctor's there for one thing

498.94 512.11 A: uh a lotta these doctors they don't they push the pills and then they get the people to come back and like you say they get addicted and it's worse than uh going down there and smoking a joint of marijuana or something you know 

511.62 524.86 B: right i mean i i'll still smoke a little pot once in a while but i don't oh i don't do it as nearly as nearly a tenth as much as i used to
