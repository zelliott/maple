290.73 296.10 B: oh that's even fictional following the war and everything it's about terrible [mn] 

296.38 301.47 A: mhm well everybody in t._v. knows that t._v. is not about news or reality it's about entertainment 

300.91 303.80 B: yeah definitely all about the ratings 

304.08 306.22 B: how many folks you can catch to watch 

306.99 314.56 B: the grossest thing i don't know and these survivor shows that are going all around the world and [mn] some insane stunts 

314.94 318.26 A: mhm i think all these ah t._v. programmers are on drugs 

317.85 320.36 B: yeah probably [laughter] 

319.48 324.80 A: oh but not probably i think they are they sit there thinking about what what next sugar coated thing that people will swallow 

324.41 325.49 B: (( oh oh i know )) 

324.87 327.10 A: and they they go as far out as they can 

326.77 327.75 B: mhm 

327.20 330.64 A: [cough] and then someone with a budget says no you gotta come back from further in 

330.33 331.47 B: [laughter] 

330.85 332.44 A: and that's about where it is 

331.86 335.53 B: yeah that's that's probably i would agree [mn] 

335.57 340.16 B: and some of them are so far fetched and i have a younger sister who's three years younger than i but [mn] 

340.44 346.55 B: oh well she'll be twenty one coming up in august and she's still in ah middle high school mentality [mn] 

346.50 357.01 B: so she watches all of these programs and if i happen to go visit my parents where she lives right now and ah they're on i mean you cannot tear her away from them one bit 

355.96 358.08 A: is that because she's been pre programmed 

357.79 364.92 B: i think so she's very susceptible to that she's the type of person that pretty much follows the group and ah 

360.48 362.13 A: mhm 

365.31 370.09 B: does whatever's popular at the time popular clothes popular music [cough] 

370.42 374.15 B: you know i like to buck the system a little bit myself so i don't [mn] 

374.38 375.83 B: quite watch all of those [mn] 

377.24 382.03 A: why did did you have to go to school and tear your w- tear yourself away from t._v. or something 

381.32 384.93 B: no not particularly um i'm always fond of ah 

385.51 387.46 B: (( [mn] i don't know ah )) 

387.97 395.18 B: i don't know what i'm fond of come to think of it a lot of i watch a lot of learning channel and the discovery channel um 

396.10 403.26 B: [mn] m._t._v. is right out for me [mn] cartoon is a great little kickback for let- letting your ni- mind go numb 

403.33 415.24 B: just to watch cartoons nowadays they're rerunning a lot of things from the eighties from when i grew up ah like the a team and mcgyver and knight rider all of these shows are on and i think of those as you know 

415.54 419.45 B: quality dramatic t._v. compared to the some of the things that are on now 

419.74 423.43 A: i think the best ones are ah myst- mystery science theater 

423.00 424.88 B: oh i love that show 

424.43 427.92 A: where you have the three little guys commenting on what's really going on 

425.62 426.66 B: mhm 

427.44 428.56 B: mhm 

427.99 430.64 A: now that- that's what's missing off reality t._v. 

430.09 431.14 B: mhm 

431.80 433.32 B: commentators [laughter] 

433.31 435.07 A: well somebody actually you know 

435.25 441.35 A: putting the real twist on what's going on with these things or or or taking the humor side of it you know 

437.75 438.90 B: oh yeah 

441.03 447.99 B: mhm oh i think itself is kind of funny if you're reading beyond the what you see on the t._v. 

448.00 450.68 B: i think the whole concept is hilarious 

450.85 452.28 B: and such a farce 

452.63 454.90 A: is it ah are we being brainwashed [laughter] 

455.24 466.73 B: well [mn] i don't know if you are but i'm not [laughter] i like i i think so i think the media's just a big circus mostly media circus of course 

466.57 479.11 A: well um in terms of your sister though i mean she she seems to be hooked on this kinda thing and i remember having a conversation i'm sorry with with somebody one time who was in the advertising industry and they have they have pulses in the t._v.s 

470.15 471.43 B: yeah she is 

475.45 476.83 B: mhm 

478.61 480.00 B: mhm 

479.35 484.19 A: to ah to tune into your alpha waves or whatever it is that makes you most relaxed or excited or whatever

527.52 534.01 B: and things like that and the conversation just strayed and strayed and strayed different different ways 

534.24 544.28 B: and you know i'm i'm trying to think about the actual study is this a linguistic study to find out how we talk or what we talk about or you know [mn] 

544.78 547.31 B: i think there's probably some kind of a hidden meaning 

547.45 549.23 B: [mn] somewhere along the line 

548.32 551.68 A: ha- it has something to do with linguistics i believe i'm not sure
