190.16 191.48 B: yeah 

194.08 206.28 B: yeah but you know you can't go wrong with the rib eye i tell you [laughter] you get one of those uh they're easy to cook you know they're hard to mess up but uh some of the other ones yeah they get real tough on you if you 

197.33 199.88 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

202.07 203.24 A: that's true

239.95 245.67 B: i haven't had anything that exotic uh i suppose i'm trying to think of what was 

242.28 243.71 A: [laughter] 

246.30 249.67 B: the most exotic i went to a there's a restaurant 

249.91 253.18 B: in the area called malibu up around here up in the hills 

253.34 254.45 A: mhm 

253.38 258.10 B: and they have uh they specialize it used to be a hunting lodge back in the

266.85 268.51 A: right 

268.16 270.35 B: and i think i had 

271.08 282.20 B: i've been there a couple of time one time i did have ostrich which wasn't didn't seem to be too exotic at the time the way the waiter talked me into it but uh the other thing 

276.50 277.06 A: (( [cough] )) 

278.83 280.06 A: [laughter]

296.95 298.23 B: type uh 

296.97 298.18 A: right [mn] 

298.27 300.26 B: after taste to it 

299.36 302.63 A: it's kind of gamy i think [laughter] 

300.60 309.80 B: [laughter] yeah like you know how they say yeah you got to soak it in buttermilk for [laughter] two days or something you know it's 

305.29 306.16 A: yeah 

306.45 313.03 A: [laughter] yeah it's definitely it's definitely different from beef and not in a good way i think
