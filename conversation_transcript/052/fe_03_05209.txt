0.50 3.04 B: hello good evening my name is feni 

0.81 1.61 A: (( [mn] )) 

3.12 3.88 A: who 

3.95 5.20 A: feni 

4.85 5.78 B: yes 

5.48 7.51 A: okay and i'm steve 

7.44 8.94 B: hi steve how are you 

8.56 12.45 A: oh i'm doing fine tonight we're supposed to talk about food here 

12.57 20.56 B: uh not just that but which we like better eating at a restaurant or eating at home and i think that's sort of a an apples and oranges question because there's 

17.64 18.20 A: (( [mn] )) 

19.25 23.67 A: yeah yeah [mn] i think it all depends on what the uh circumstances are 

23.56 25.35 B: exactly 

24.33 26.53 A: mhm 

25.44 32.14 B: but having said that uh since i really enjoy eating i do a lot of eating at home and also eating out 

31.54 41.39 A: well me too me too i uh i i cook some of my own meals and uh you know every uh all the adults in in my house uh male and female uh participate in uh 

41.35 47.56 A: um in um cooking the meal [mn] i have an extended three generation family here 

47.71 54.18 B: and what you said participate that is a very important uh aspect of meals that are cooked at home i think 

51.18 52.09 A: yes 

52.85 56.13 A: yes yes yes yes yes 

56.23 57.33 B: [noise] 

56.60 69.01 A: yes i i think that there are things that we do at home that probably they could not get away with in a restaurant as to sanitary conditions etcetera etcetera you know like using the same uh um 

65.05 66.65 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

68.77 70.00 B: [noise] 

68.84 81.87 A: uh board for cutting meat and vegetables i mean you you could not do that in a restaurant but we do it at home and we get away with it 'cause nobody's inspecting over our shoulder [laughter] 

74.06 75.31 B: sure yeah 

77.93 78.89 B: (( yeah )) 

80.97 85.03 B: but there are plenty of times when i really look forward to a meal out not just 

84.35 85.87 A: truly yeah 

85.05 87.80 B: because then i don't have the uh 

87.99 93.30 B: whole uh cleaning up issue but also because there's things a restaurant will do that i simply can't 

89.49 91.03 A: right the cleaning up 

92.97 94.91 A: mhm yeah 

93.81 97.68 B: uh they can uh go out in the morning and get really nice fresh fish 

97.83 98.65 A: uh-huh 

97.88 102.83 B: and that that certainly is something that i don't often have an opportunity to do 

102.54 104.92 A: (( right right right right yeah )) 

105.65 112.74 A: yeah and and and yeah uh the difficulty of of the meal itself sometimes uh um 

112.69 122.27 A: you know i i don't know that much about cooking japanese foods so if i want to have japanese food i go to a japanese restaurant i i wouldn't try to make it myself i don't think 

122.34 127.27 B: [laughter] it's funny that you mention that 'cause that's one of the things i really enjoy cooking at home 

125.77 128.23 A: mhm mhm oh you do you do 

127.80 137.82 B: oh yeah um but th- uh i think it shows that there there are many different types of cuisine i know absolutely nothing about i mean i find it really difficult to 

134.70 135.96 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

138.05 140.87 B: prepare good tasting italian food 

140.28 142.32 A: uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh 

141.62 146.49 B: because there are all these nuances to the sauces that i haven't uh mastered [noise] 

144.25 146.01 A: right 

146.09 150.38 A: yeah i i think a lot of it depends on on the quality of the olive oil 

150.84 153.47 B: uh-huh ye- yeah 

151.64 165.53 A: yeah i i used to live in in fresno california and that's olive country yeah that's olive country and um we used to get uh olive uh oil fresh pressed from off the trees 

155.42 156.91 B: (( oh yeah yeah oh )) 

157.38 158.93 B: oh yeah 

164.46 165.02 B: (( [mn] )) 

165.53 167.57 B: that sounds so delicious 

167.00 169.75 A: yeah yeah and there's a difference 

169.95 172.68 A: from what you get you know in the stores 

172.74 176.21 B: yeah fresno also produces a lot of really great fruit i've had um 

175.42 177.28 A: yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah 

176.56 186.08 B: some grapefruits and oranges and apples from a friend's farm out there and it's heavenly yeah i don't think i've had any apricots in fresno 

178.00 179.17 A: yeah 

179.19 180.05 A: uh-huh 

181.10 182.95 A: right apricots 

183.42 188.03 A: yeah you haven't uh well yeah 

186.43 188.71 B: but uh i'll have to get on that 

188.13 189.99 A: yeah yeah 

190.12 195.71 A: yeah yeah nothing nuts mostly the fruits the nuts are a little farther north in california 

195.20 201.11 B: i [mn] i have tasted some of the best uh almonds i've ever had in my life came from fresno 

200.66 203.40 A: mhm mhm mhm mhm 

202.05 204.06 B: they were really huge and milky 

203.94 205.74 A: yeah yeah 

205.48 207.52 B: (( um and )) 

207.62 212.41 B: some of them i toasted up and made into a certain granola dried granola thing 

211.12 214.46 A: uh-huh yeah yeah yeah 

213.48 219.99 B: and that's another asset to cooking at home is uh you get to really experiment and discover your 

218.14 219.91 A: uh-huh truly 

220.03 227.75 B: own tastes in a way that you can't you don't have the time or luxury to do at a restaurant in the same way i 

221.03 222.63 A: yeah 

225.53 237.70 A: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah huh i agree i agree when you when you cook a a japanese food uh do you cook uh sushi and and things like that 

237.40 239.65 B: have made sushi yeah um 

240.11 244.28 B: in sushi there's a lot of technique to the preparation 

243.97 245.74 A: mhm 

244.31 248.13 B: you need to have uh first off the right equipment but 

247.54 249.21 A: right 

248.43 260.22 B: um and the the right sort of fish is very important and and um p- preparing the rice you need a certain type of rice and it needs to be cooked with a certain amount of moisture in it 

251.92 253.04 A: (( mhm )) 

255.82 257.38 A: (( mhm yes )) 

259.62 261.10 A: yes yes 

260.28 262.62 B: (( so it's you cling clumps together )) 

262.00 266.40 A: right right you can kind of roll it into a ball with your hands 

263.22 264.54 B: and uh 

266.50 275.98 B: there are also um certain types of dried seaweed but um [mn] l- l- like [mn] um same thing as with olive oil it's really about the ingredients 

269.75 271.54 A: (( yes yes yes mhm )) 

275.54 276.93 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

276.44 280.09 B: you have to pay a lot of attention to that 

278.45 279.67 A: (( yeah yep )) 

279.69 281.13 A: yeah 

283.59 284.55 A: (( yeah it's uh )) 

284.13 285.76 B: and um 

286.17 292.90 B: one thing i've been in i've enjoyed a lot lately is uh preparing cold noodle dishes so uh 

292.21 294.89 A: cold noodle uh-huh like salads 

293.53 294.67 B: yeah i'm 

295.00 298.85 B: yeah they're like salads sort of um with uh japanese buckwheat noodles 

299.03 300.28 A: (( hm )) 

299.52 305.50 B: and then i eat them either add a bit of freshly pickled cucumber which has been 

305.47 314.84 B: uh finely you finely chop the cucumber and then add um so- a little bit of [mn] rice wine vinegar and toasted sesame seed to it 

308.37 310.55 A: mhm mhm 

314.40 316.19 A: (( mhm )) 

315.29 321.37 B: and then you toss that in with the cold the noodles which have been chilling for a little while and the noodles are dressed in sesame oil 

319.23 319.94 A: (( yes )) 

321.05 322.40 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

321.45 331.58 B: and you add some tamari which is a very salty s- uh soya sauce like dressing and um zucchini and bell pepper 

326.89 329.42 A: mhm mhm mhm mhm 

331.09 332.63 A: mhm mhm 

331.61 340.68 B: which are warm but not hot and that that's a very good pleasant thing to eat um i live in california so on a warm summer evening it's a good thing to be eating 

333.71 334.47 A: yeah 

337.75 338.60 A: yeah 

340.53 344.88 A: yeah yeah exactly exactly yeah 

346.28 357.87 A: yeah yeah you get inspiration from you know you know for the japanese the appearance of the food is just as important as the taste with the chinese [mn] 

357.74 364.10 A: they they really don't care that much about the appearance of it they just mainly go for the [laughter] taste yeah 

362.62 367.66 B: right and um you see that's a good point because in a restaurant uh 

368.05 374.12 B: the japanese chefs are much m- more trained in the appearance and presentation than i am 

371.88 372.86 A: yes 

373.08 375.60 A: yes yes yes 

374.22 381.97 B: so there's a big difference in in that sense in going to a japanese restaurant versus eating anything that i would have [laughter] cooked at home 

381.43 394.37 A: right right the ceremony yeah yeah yeah if you went through the ceremony at home i mean people would say [laughter] what wha- what's this [laughter] you trying to change your culture [laughter] 

383.82 386.08 B: yeah most certainly the ceremony 

393.34 394.80 B: [laughter] 

394.29 405.20 A: [laughter] yeah yeah yeah yeah but i mean you think nothing of going into a japanese restaurant taking off your shoes and squatting down on the floor and you know uh eating virtually off your lap 

405.38 406.35 A: uh 

405.65 407.06 B: (( yeah exactly you )) 

406.58 408.62 A: yeah yeah yeah 

409.37 419.69 A: have you ever tried the uh the country inn uh uh style of of japanese restaurants i i'm i'm not sure exactly how you pronounce that riyoko or something like that 

409.44 410.35 B: (( know )) 

419.55 421.12 B: (( no i don't know those )) 

421.00 426.88 A: hm i i got a a cookbook one time that was based on that and uh 

426.78 441.25 A: uh they said that uh you know if you want to know any country's uh actual cuisine you take the country cooking over you know what they formally present in a uh you know a formal presentation in a restaurant 

440.71 443.01 B: (( sure yeah that makes perfect sense )) 

441.94 444.21 A: yeah yeah yeah 

444.32 445.35 B: um 

445.53 449.27 B: (( no i've i've eaten a lot of say german [mn] um )) 

449.60 451.90 B: uh country cuisine 

450.93 454.17 A: mhm mhm mhm 

452.31 461.52 B: but uh i'm not actually a not [mn] japanese food because i've never travelled to japan so all the of the japanese that i've eaten has been in the states [laughter] 

458.03 459.89 A: yeah me either 

461.33 463.72 A: yeah yeah yeah 

464.47 469.71 A: they probably wouldn't have that in countries where japanese go abroad because 

469.88 480.23 A: uh you know the only people that they get to eat [laughter] there would be would be other japanese they wouldn't get too many uh uh [laughter] foreigners you know 

480.33 481.95 B: (( well yeah )) 

480.50 489.65 A: yeah yeah i i've travelled in in asia i i uh went in the phillipines and i studied and i uh of course was a a soldier in vietnam and uh you know 

489.82 490.74 A: (( uh )) 

490.71 505.22 A: i i've been to asia several times taiwan i taught over there in uh english as a second language and i've had thoughts of of going to korea as a teacher for english as a second language but we're supposed to be talking about food aren't we [laughter] 

496.74 497.94 B: (( oh wow [mn] )) 

504.47 510.37 B: yeah but i mean travel is a great way to experience different types of restaurants and different cuisines 

506.60 509.60 A: (( it is it is it is yeah yeah )) 

511.46 514.21 B: uh it's a very exciting way to do it 

512.98 517.35 A: mhm mhm mhm yeah yeah 

518.00 519.25 B: and um 

518.08 528.54 A: yeah and uh i think if you went to italy and you went to different parts of italy and you learned the differences between each region's cuisine uh then um 

528.65 540.51 A: i i think you could you could make meaningful distinctions when you when you plan a menu you know the northern italian um the southern italian and the different tomato sauces and and so forth 

539.46 540.68 B: oh boy 

541.48 546.95 B: yeah there there's also a beauty in collecting the ingredients at home because [mn] 

546.08 547.69 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

547.00 549.14 B: sort of things like tomatoes you can 

549.61 550.80 B: uh 

551.50 553.00 B: you can really um 

553.69 555.42 B: fine tune the selection 

555.08 557.29 A: yeah yeah 

557.14 567.36 B: um i i was just thinking that sometimes you go to a restaurant you order a tomato salad you end up with uh something that isn't necessarily as earthy or authentic tasting as what you'll get out of your own garden [laughter] 

565.92 575.76 A: yeah exactly exactly yeah it's kind of uniform whereas if you get something out of your own garden you might not be able to describe it too well but 

575.62 585.40 A: the taste would be entirely different so i i think basically we're we're coming to somewhat of an agreement that uh we do like uh eating at home uh 

584.55 586.38 B: yeah 

585.45 587.44 A: [mn] for the for the uh 

587.46 591.51 A: reason of being able to put together our own ingredients in our own 

591.60 593.84 A: styles and our own you know 

594.27 597.06 A: uh preferences yeah 

598.03 599.83 B: (( yeah i think you're right )) 

598.06 598.70 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

599.44 599.89 A: yeah
