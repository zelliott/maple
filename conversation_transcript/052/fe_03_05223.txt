0.26 1.42 A: hello [lipsmack] 

1.07 2.31 B: hello 

2.21 3.88 A: hi my name is fabio 

3.66 4.99 B: this is j. b. 

4.92 6.51 A: (( j. b. how are you )) 

6.11 7.74 B: good doing well 

7.40 8.42 A: okay 

8.45 10.54 A: i i have you done this before 

9.95 11.88 B: i've not done this before 

11.11 12.88 A: my ah myself either 

13.05 15.97 A: so i think we're supposed to talk about illness 

15.54 16.53 B: yes 

16.19 17.08 A: (( yes )) 

16.74 20.71 B: and the fact is i have one right now so [laughter] yes 

19.34 24.77 A: really what what what i've i've had one recently what what's your situation 

23.75 26.21 B: [lipsmack] i think it's just because of the weather 

26.05 30.19 A: mhm [lipsmack] are you in the north east in the ne- new york area or 

28.87 35.63 B: [lipsmack] ah in the ah north east yeah yeah and it's but it's ah but it's been nice the last couple of days 

31.17 32.25 A: mhm 

35.48 36.40 A: mhm 

35.80 37.94 B: and just been travelling and stuff 

38.07 40.74 A: is it some sort of respiratory illness or 

40.36 44.83 B: ah just a mm head cold and different things like that 

42.19 43.42 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

44.24 46.74 A: well i recently had bronchitis 

47.01 48.67 A: which um 

48.76 52.96 A: [lipsmack] i i thought the first day it was just a cold and went to work 

53.52 60.91 A: and the second day stayed home but still thought it was a cold and finally by the forth day went to doctor and got antibiotics 

61.06 64.13 A: which i regretted not having done sooner 

64.52 65.92 A: (( and ah )) 

64.61 70.78 B: so so one of the questions is what would you have done ah to keep yourself well [noise] [noise] 

70.85 73.46 A: well i would've gone to the doctor much sooner 

73.48 76.91 A: especially since ah [lipsmack] i had fever 

77.04 79.12 A: but i tend to um 

79.21 81.86 A: be reluctant to go to doctors 

82.09 88.09 A: and ah i don't get sick very often but but it really really knocked me out for a few days 

88.31 91.97 A: and it took a week after that to really fully recover 

92.04 105.27 A: so it was um [lipsmack] and i don't know i live in in brooklyn in new york and ah it's been a very wet and cold spring and and and ah i guess beginning of summer now 

104.90 107.37 B: yeah do you get c- ah do you get colds often 

107.87 109.53 A: perhaps once a year 

109.15 110.94 B: yeah 

109.68 112.84 A: once a year perhaps usually in the fall or the winter 

112.90 118.19 A: um [lipsmack] and i've been getting a flu shot the last few years i think that that's helped 

118.35 119.76 A: and how 'bout yourself 

119.50 127.53 B: ah i did it twice i i i mean twi- usually twice per year i get a really bad cold other times it might just be excuses so 

124.53 125.37 A: mhm 

126.80 128.08 A: excuses 

127.71 129.20 B: yeah [laughter] 

128.27 130.06 A: i'm not sure what you mean by that mhm 

129.18 143.66 B: well sometimes you just don't wanna ah you just don't wanna do something so ah so i think that that ah combination of what is happening in in life and what is happening in ah in work and stuff like that can can ah 

143.69 145.64 B: [noise] can get you down ah 

144.77 146.11 A: just wear you down 

146.04 157.11 B: we- ah just wear you down but it's also you're you're you're kind of like ah okay so this is what's happening and and ah stress and stuff like that can cause it as opposed to the weather 

155.22 156.06 A: mhm 

156.72 160.37 A: [lipsmack] is it because it weakens the immune system 

159.94 167.01 B: it could be i i i'm certainly not a doctor so i can't really ah analyze what's the reasoning behind it and stuff 

163.42 164.42 A: yeah 

166.72 167.97 A: mhm 

167.35 178.43 B: ah but it certainly has it's effect ah and these the the the the regular colds that come twice ah twice a year or so usually ah wipe me out for a couple of days 

178.20 179.11 A: (( mhm )) 

178.52 180.19 B: completely 

179.34 185.29 A: and are they um i think i asked you this before are they seasonal or are they ah sort of unscheduled or 

183.30 184.13 B: (( ah [mn] no )) 

186.03 194.80 B: nothing nothing um perse i think it's a combination of ah of what's happening in the weather and also what's happening [noise] um 

194.82 197.01 B: (( what's happening ah )) 

197.07 205.77 B: ah yeah just depends on the weather and if i take care of myself there are some times that you you just take care of yourselves you take care of yourself much better than you would 

202.87 203.74 A: mhm 

205.31 208.64 A: and what does that mean take care of yourself taking vitamins 

206.84 213.60 B: um exercising vitamins um eating right getting more sleep 

209.91 211.80 A: mhm getting more sleep 

213.44 214.28 A: mhm 

213.63 217.01 B: i mean you i i i certainly ah tend to 

217.39 227.37 B: [lipsmack] i certainly tend to ah get more more um [lipsmack] um more sleep during during the weekends than i do during the week 

227.01 228.43 A: yes yes 

227.45 235.97 B: so ah if there's just a series of let's say i'll go a whole week without um without sleeping and then all of a sudden comes to the weekend 

228.96 229.52 A: (( [cough] )) 

235.65 236.55 A: mhm 

235.94 244.81 B: and i'm still not getting the sleep ah i have something to do or something then all of a sudden i will ah ah i'll um [lipsmack] 

239.90 241.15 A: right 

244.89 247.06 B: i'll be what's it called i'll be ah 

247.61 254.49 B: [noise] i'll i'll all of a sudden start getting really tired and really dreary and stuff like that yeah 

252.21 253.44 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

253.82 257.57 A: [lipsmack] do do you believe in the ah efficacy of vitamin c 

257.87 259.71 B: um actually there's 

258.58 261.01 A: there's a bit of a controversy about it and ah 

260.04 268.78 B: yeah actually the thing that i've been taking that ah been really interesting is um [lipsmack] what is it called it's called ah zinc 

268.19 269.28 A: yes 

269.31 270.34 A: mhm 

269.77 276.98 B: and ah i haven't i haven't done the um [lipsmack] what is that called the ah there's another kind of herb that you're supposed to take 

276.70 278.25 A: ah echinacea 

277.72 283.06 B: yeah echinacea so i don't do echinacea but um but the what's it called but the ah 

279.90 280.74 A: mhm 

282.82 295.95 B: wh- what has been great was is the zinc um i don't know ah i don't know what what type it's like these pills and and each time i um like feeling some kind of sickness coming on i'll take that and and it's worked so far 

285.74 286.63 A: (( [cough] mhm )) 

295.53 298.40 A: so you you you only take it when you feel ah 

298.17 307.42 B: yeah it's not a daily thing it's not a daily thing but ah every so often it ah [mn] you're i'm about to come down with something and i'll be like 

299.60 300.55 A: mhm 

300.94 302.01 A: mhm 

307.19 313.42 B: okay let me ah let me start let me start ah taking that and it seems to work 

313.13 314.27 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

313.70 314.97 B: it seems to work 

315.10 329.41 B: um but the o- but ah yeah the the fact is is that ah the north east really like i know i was in washington yesterday and ah and um it was beautiful out there and i was just walking around in the heat 

326.64 327.51 A: yeah 

329.50 333.57 B: and then ah you walk into an air conditioned room and so it's 

333.41 334.48 A: mhm 

333.88 337.30 B: just back and forth but ah hopefully the weather will ah 

335.07 335.63 A: (( [cough] )) 

337.34 344.73 B: will kind of calm down over time yeah ah have you been doing these ah when did you sign up for these things 

338.55 340.73 A: yes the pattern will change hopefully 

344.64 348.98 A: um yesterday oh no actually today today actually 

346.28 347.30 B: oh really 

347.31 348.19 B: okay 

348.35 349.17 B: okay 

349.07 352.27 A: and this is the first time mhm 

351.63 355.33 B: yeah they're interesting um it's ah i mean 

355.30 360.52 A: do you know what the purpose of them is it it's some sort of linguistics study but what precisely 

355.35 356.09 B: (( wh- )) 

356.80 358.74 B: ah they're probably getting [noise] 

359.72 369.83 B: yeah i'm not sure exactly what they um what they're doing they could be testing anything they could be ah testing on how long out of the ten minutes we're really talking about the subject or if we're getting into 

367.72 368.53 A: uh-huh 

368.82 370.81 A: (( well we better get back to it then [laughter] mhm )) 

369.97 376.93 B: [laughter] or if we're getting into issues of um other issues and stuff but ah you never know 

375.83 382.27 A: [lipsmack] well that that tends to be the nature of conversation i think it kind of drifts and comes back and drifts again and mhm 

380.52 389.33 B: right right or they could also be doing how how two males talk to each other versus two females or two ah a male and a female and so on and so forth 

388.40 389.22 A: mhm 

389.20 395.63 B: there's all kinds of ah tests that that can be done in order to study what's ah what's happening 

395.28 405.67 A: yeah before i signed up i did do a a search on the um i forget what it's called now the the center of university of pen that's sponsoring this and apparently it is a well established 

403.48 405.24 B: yeah 

405.86 407.34 A: linguistic center 

406.80 417.14 B: yeah it was a ah it was also i i think everyone has their hesitations of what to do and how to do this and stuff and ah and especially when you get it from someone how'd you hear about it 

410.43 411.69 A: (( [cough] mhm [lipsmack] )) 

416.79 418.68 A: through a um 

418.73 426.09 A: [lipsmack] frankly i'm trying to make a a few extra dollars and i go to this ah site called craig's list 

421.60 423.30 B: yeah 

425.92 427.06 B: yeah 

426.41 428.34 A: dot org have you heard about it 

427.23 429.40 B: yeah no i haven't heard about it mhm 

428.45 438.39 A: and they have things like this and sort of odd temp temp jobs and ah [lipsmack] ah and i'm a and especially they have translation jobs 

438.60 444.71 A: which i feel i'd be capable of doing very well but i'm i've never i'm from ita- italy originally 

441.63 443.52 B: where are you from originally 

443.97 445.01 B: (( oh okay )) 

444.87 449.04 A: and but i i've never done it and i don't know how to break into it i'm sorry 

445.73 447.02 B: hence the name 

447.46 455.58 B: [laughter] ah hence the name [laughter] um yeah i i think that it's ah look i'm sure that um 

449.75 451.65 A: yes yes 

455.83 457.46 B: the consulate here 

457.56 463.03 B: in ah the states or the embassy whatever would be would would probably have information 

461.11 461.97 A: mhm 

462.91 469.32 A: [lipsmack] yeah it's just hard to break into without experience and ah you know everybody wants experience and ah 

465.49 467.38 B: yeah 

469.42 476.76 A: you know i i've actually responded to some things and said you know i i've i'll do a sample gladly for free and judge from that and ah 

474.66 476.79 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

476.89 486.14 B: right it's also i i mean lo- look your your english is perfect so it's probably ah probably worthwhile for to send in a send in a voice 

483.47 485.54 A: but well i'm kind of in 

485.69 488.11 A: well i immigrated here when i was five 

487.56 489.44 B: yeah 

488.19 489.48 A: so 

489.67 498.69 A: you know until i was five i spoke only italian and that kind of puts me in a special situation i think that you know people who learn another language as an adult always have i think some tra- 

491.87 493.74 B: yeah 

497.12 497.71 B: (( [mn] )) 

498.90 507.36 A: never really [lipsmack] are completely ah versed in that language in terms of pronunciation or you know i don't know 

500.94 503.05 B: fully grasp it 

507.75 510.33 A: so anyway um 

510.53 513.84 B: yeah but you could you should i mean you should send over i mean especially the ah 

513.81 517.33 B: if people are are hesitant i mean there's there's opportunities for 

517.11 530.06 B: translations between english and italian i'm sure at conferences and and stuff like that as well yeah um yeah so i mean this this this getting back to the subject the fact is that this sickness is ah [noise] 

519.91 522.35 A: hm oh there are yeah mhm 

529.94 533.56 B: it ah it comes and goes and it when it wipes you out 

531.69 534.83 A: mhm mm have you ever been have you ever been seriously ill 

535.11 536.84 B: um 

536.53 538.26 A: (( i don't know how old you are or )) 

537.99 543.57 B: yeah um [mn] no not really um i'm mid thirties and stuff 

540.70 547.43 A: yeah i have i have i had i had um hepatitis a once [lipsmack] which 

545.53 547.93 B: yeah did you get it here or 

547.90 555.99 A: ah i'm not sure that the kind of hepatitis you get from eating dirty food or i think maybe from swimming in dirty water or something like that 

552.23 552.99 B: uh-huh 

555.30 556.94 B: right 

556.23 563.61 A: and it was very scary ah i had over a hundred degree fever for three weeks straight 

561.76 565.00 B: mhm yeah 

563.93 574.31 A: and [lipsmack] it was the first time i was seriously ill and until that time [lipsmack] i had sort of believed myself to be invulnerable 

573.86 575.70 B: right 

574.42 575.33 A: (( you know )) 

575.61 578.65 A: in in the sense that you know my 

579.20 581.19 A: [mn] in a mind over matter 

581.00 581.76 B: uh-huh 

581.37 582.76 A: kind of sense 

582.29 583.04 B: uh-huh 

583.10 589.35 A: and that took the that took my invulnerability away from me and my my sense of invulnerability 

586.53 587.55 B: right 

589.74 591.21 A: [lipsmack] and um 

591.65 593.71 A: [lipsmack] and yet i think 

593.92 599.89 A: again ah you know i really think that the immune system is subject to to emotional ah
