205.46 207.21 B: yeah yeah 

206.53 211.59 A: i'm lucky i have no food allergies or anything like that i guess as far as getting sick ah 

208.63 210.21 B: right yeah 

211.82 213.80 A: one time a year that's about it 

213.26 214.92 B: right right 

213.86 226.16 A: and usually that doesn't go too far and if i don't catch it in the bud ah it gets a little a little nasty you know the main thing you know sneezing and things like that [laughter] i won't go into any gross details of course but 

222.51 224.03 B: yeah yeah 

225.51 228.24 B: right right yeah 

226.46 228.54 A: (( it's interesting )) 

229.62 234.17 B: yeah actually i tend to probably do pretty well considering you know there's a lot of um 

234.80 235.61 A: yeah 

234.99 236.70 B: ah scares around 

236.42 237.64 A: oh definitely 

236.73 239.43 B: you know health scares around so um 

238.01 243.11 A: mhm between sars coming i guess what is it prairie dogs now [laughter] 

242.55 247.30 B: oh no it's something else it it's um monkey monkey pox 

246.12 247.06 A: oh 

247.15 249.48 A: oh monkey pox that's what that was 

247.56 251.56 B: monkey pox yeah yeah monkey pox yeah yeah 

249.55 250.38 A: (( [laughter] )) 

251.59 259.52 B: so i don't know and then they say it usually comes from hanging around prairie dogs so i live in the middle of the city so that that eliminates me 

257.31 258.61 A: [laughter] 

258.93 268.00 A: well i'm just about in the middle of nowhere so it's so it's a very small town and there's not much going on but i'm from a larger town i went to school here and stayed so 

260.94 262.09 B: okay 

264.43 265.44 B: yeah 

266.00 270.17 B: right yeah yeah yeah 

268.01 269.48 A: not too much going on 

269.58 271.56 A: not as big a scene as new york is [laughter] 

270.35 283.26 B: yeah right right yeah well new york city has its challenges because there's so many people and there's so many buildings and everything's all close together and you're always in the subway or the bus usually walking in the street you're always next to somebody too who is always sneezing 

274.98 276.11 A: mhm 

282.88 284.04 A: [laughter] 

283.44 288.77 B: you know and they don't tend to be too too courtes- you know they don't use too much courtesy just sneeze 

286.35 287.22 A: no 

288.25 289.74 A: oh i can't stand it and don't 

291.69 292.67 A: ((  )) 

292.06 297.99 B: you do tend to that's why i tend to be a little cautious about what i eat and try to keep my system together you 

295.87 296.89 A: ((  )) 

297.73 300.09 A: yeah that's definitely gross 

298.48 299.45 B: (( know )) 

299.48 302.33 B: (( yeah )) 

300.11 308.03 A: [laughter] yeah folks walking around as a as a as another member of the male species another thing that gets me is always going 

308.08 314.95 A: ah to the restroom and the guys that don't wash their hands and i and i work in a business where i have to wash my hands constantly it's not food service i 

313.00 313.87 B: (( you )) 

314.72 315.88 B: (( know right )) 

315.38 319.82 A: but i do need to keep clean and you know smudge and grease free and everything else 

318.95 325.18 B: right yeah yeah and i guess the other reason too why my health's pretty pretty good i i i don't eat in restaurants too often 

324.73 325.91 A: mhm 

325.22 326.72 B: for that very reason 

326.32 327.57 A: oh yeah that's 

326.85 329.10 B: for that very reason yeah you know 

328.43 329.81 A: very very bizarre 

329.17 334.85 B: yeah i know the few times that i do eat in a restaurant i notice a lot of things and i'm like it just makes me sick so i don't 

334.88 335.86 A: uh-huh 

335.50 338.27 B: (( i don't visit restaurants that often )) 

337.93 340.20 A: yeah some sometimes you have to 

340.21 349.97 A: i know there's a couple of places that i won't go to anymore because in fact one time there was a a chinese eatery down the road from me here and ah 

340.29 341.26 B: yeah 

350.05 360.98 A: we left there and ah went actually shopping at wal-mart and the girl that was the ah hostess there we saw her flying around in one of the aisles and she was picking up um 

353.70 354.60 B: (( mm )) 

361.24 374.81 A: little boxes of mouse traps [laughter] and she said oh we never had this problem i don't understand it and i was i was a regular there until that happened [laughter] that's that's definitely not a good thing [laughter] 

363.06 364.99 B: (( mhm )) 

366.80 367.73 B: (( mm )) 

370.01 372.50 B: i know right right 

372.60 373.58 B: yeah 

373.83 387.78 B: yeah yeah well here in new york we just there's just clearly a problem and the city doesn't have enough money to hire people to go round and check the restaurants and when they go check the restaurants the restaurants pay 'em an awful lot of money 

380.38 382.00 A: oh yeah 

383.71 384.63 A: mhm 

387.16 388.76 A: oh yeah definitely [laughter] 

387.77 396.24 B: so um there there there's problems and i see a lot of it i don't even bother complaining about it i just don't even eat there i just don't bother to eat there you know 

393.89 395.06 A: (( yeah sometimes )) 

395.29 399.25 A: yeah in a place that large there's so many different places and so many different peoples 

398.81 404.93 B: yeah yeah right an- an- and the problem is too i think a lot of people just tend to take it for granted 

399.33 401.02 A: around and everything 

404.32 405.67 A: mhm 

404.98 414.80 B: so they kind of if you don't like go along with it they tend to look at you like you're odd like you sit there in a restaurant and you complain because you see a piece of hair in the food or something the waiter looks at you like you're crazy 

414.21 415.49 A: oh yeah 

414.88 419.53 B: and then if you call the manager [laughter] or something they're like what's wrong with you [laughter] 

416.60 417.61 A: [laughter] 

418.72 420.83 A: that's totally a viable excuse though 

420.65 430.28 B: right right yeah you know so um an- and i know of ah once or twice in the past a number of years ago i did get um food poisoning 

429.97 431.05 A: oh really 

430.50 435.75 B: yeah and that did that didn't really help me being wanting to be able to you know eat in restaurants that often either 

434.32 439.07 A: [laughter] yeah i would guess not it's luck that i've never had that the 

436.55 437.53 B: no 

438.83 440.82 B: yeah yeah 

439.87 452.08 A: closest i've ever come is my father's had that when i was a young kid and i still remember that from eating in a burger king [laughter] and ah he he still to this day that boy that must have been at least fifteen years ago ah 

443.66 444.65 B: (( mm )) 

445.71 447.22 B: (( mm mm )) 

450.68 452.83 B: yeah yeah 

452.63 455.66 A: and he still doesn't go back there and ah i'm 

454.35 456.73 B: right right yeah 

455.89 459.20 A: blessed i guess with an iron stomach i can handle just about anything 

458.87 460.72 B: yeah yeah 

459.40 460.56 A: (( but )) 

461.02 461.82 A: (( ah )) 

461.69 466.42 B: yeah well i've got to really worry about stuff soon because my brother who is 

466.61 471.68 B: working over in china and he's coming back ah probably in summer 

467.77 468.62 A: uh-huh 

471.33 472.46 A: mhm 

471.84 481.14 B: you know so i say well i've got to you know i mean things are fine but i'll just take a little extra vitamins or something to beef up the immune system you know 

479.66 480.81 A: mhm 

481.44 485.47 B: (( phow whatever [laughter] you know )) 

482.31 485.81 A: [laughter] what a world 

485.50 488.15 B: yeah exactly yeah 

487.26 488.36 A: (( oh jeeze )) 

488.62 489.78 B: but um 

489.79 491.07 A: i have to ask 

491.23 496.94 A: is this the first time you've called on something like this or have you talked to somebody else for this study i guess i don't know 

496.49 499.04 B: yeah um they called me 

498.74 499.70 A: yeah 

499.15 500.64 B: a day last week 

500.45 501.34 A: (( oh )) 

500.74 504.71 B: and ah the top- what was the topic the topic was um 

504.99 506.78 B: oh gosh what was the topic 

507.10 508.52 B: (( oh i forgot what it was )) 

507.90 509.91 A: [laughter] 

508.88 512.16 B: (( oh that's not good some- somebody from california )) 

511.58 513.06 A: oh wow 

512.60 514.21 B: yeah yeah 

513.25 519.62 A: it's it's unusual to stay on the phone with somebody for ten minutes that you don't know it's a it's a really neat experience let me tell you the first time here but 

518.98 521.03 B: exactly yeah 

520.16 528.21 A: talking for ten minutes on some obscure topic out of the blue literally i was playing solitaire on the computer when you called [laughter] 

522.11 522.98 B: yeah 

525.99 540.86 B: yeah yeah no i know we were talking about family families what constitutes a family and that kind of stuff yeah it was really interesting yeah yeah so i just decided tonight i had some extra time to spare so i'll just sit and see what what the topic would be 

529.30 530.44 A: (( oh oh )) 

531.38 532.45 A: (( oh )) 

540.56 543.43 A: [laughter] yeah not bad 

541.13 542.84 B: you know tonight 

542.92 544.55 B: (( no no no )) 

543.94 555.10 A: i did actually i did think to get back on topic or anything but ah i did think of another time i don't know if you know anybody who gets like this but when it gets to be the fall the i guess it's certain light levels or something i have 

554.90 561.50 A: a a more of a tendency i guess to get a kind of a little queasy feeling like car sick more prone to like a migraine headache 

561.22 562.37 B: oh really 

561.86 572.06 A: yeah i think i think it's because of um the angle of the light i i'm relatively photosensitive if the sun has a chance of being out i'm going to wear sunglasses that day and um 

565.64 566.54 B: oh 

567.52 568.87 B: (( oh )) 

570.70 572.48 B: oh 

572.78 583.61 A: it's just an unusual factor that whenever it it doesn't happen in the spring or any other time and especially as bright it is with the snow in the winter and ah the gleam and everything but ah 

579.88 581.03 B: yeah 

581.52 582.70 B: (( oh that's interesting )) 

583.89 585.87 B: so this just happens in the fall 

585.28 596.95 A: yeah it just happens in the fall when the weather starts to get a little cooler i think it's the ah point where um the sun is shining down say you're driving in the car and the sun is shining down really hard but then 

588.55 589.85 B: yeah 

597.01 599.89 A: um if you're wearing darker clothing it'll absorb the heat
