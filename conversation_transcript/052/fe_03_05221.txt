283.62 296.34 A: in all turkey there are about seventy thousand doctors oh for seventy million people so that's not enough and yeah and but in ah in the states i see there's ah really very good 

289.44 292.01 B: wow yeah that's that's definitely low 

296.31 304.09 A: ah health system but ah it's still expensive for the people and ah not everyone has ah medical insurance 

303.88 312.45 A: but everything ah most of the people are very concerned about their health it is one of the most important things ah it should be that my [mn] 

312.73 316.77 A: one of the most important things and um 

314.81 316.24 B: yeah i agree 

316.91 321.88 A: ah american people are very careful about that i i believe 

318.95 319.51 B: (( [cough] )) 

322.57 326.74 B: so you found in germany ah does it a long time to get to see a doctor 

326.87 327.89 A: no actually 

327.16 329.26 B: or do you get an appointment quickly 

328.69 334.69 A: (( no it's it's quick and it's a good service and they are friendly and ah )) 

334.46 344.16 A: it's good that everyone can can go to the doctor without paying anything and even if they have a complicated surgery or something like that um 

338.95 340.17 B: yeah that is nice 

344.27 347.70 A: (( it's free and ah )) 

346.60 349.46 B: even like specialists and so forth all that's free right 

349.04 351.53 A: yeah um 

352.63 365.98 A: ah even if you don't work you have ah you you have social rights and you can go to the doctor and you have that insurance it is it is a must ah subject that you must have an insurance 

365.97 375.60 A: and the state gives the government gives you that insurance but um ah it is german people try to 

375.41 389.29 A: eat good and make um sports too and ah take care of themselves but in the states it's people are much more concerned about their health it's much more important that ah i mean 

388.61 392.76 B: so you like the german way ah that's handled better than say in america 

392.85 399.48 A: (( um they are both not bad they are both good because the um it is um )) 

399.53 400.59 A: (( they )) 

401.28 414.81 A: people usual do what they know and ah how to live long and happy and it is ah not the same in the east and i like the german way but it is i can't say that it is better than the american because 

414.70 419.91 A: (( um people here are ah very concerned as i told about their health )) 

420.11 421.70 A: [noise] and um 

422.37 422.93 B: (( [cough] )) 

422.47 424.53 A: (( and this is good ))

424.67 428.99 A: (( mhm )) 

427.57 433.48 B: definitely ah have a much longer lifespan particularly when you start getting ah older and you really need that medical 

432.71 435.93 A: [noise] yeah yeah 

433.50 434.39 B: (( ah )) 

434.22 448.82 B: ah attention and so forth ah there you have some real quality ah things like they have like like ah like with the you know the nursing homes and so forth that people can take advantage of and ah course like you said i mean that stuff can be terribly expensive in america they really 

438.52 443.37 A: (( yeah )) 

448.72 452.69 B: can can they really can drain you on some of those things with ah serious illnesses 

451.12 458.88 A: [noise] yeah um i um it is maybe ah ah the subject was to have more than 

458.77 473.46 A: certain illness but ah i i'm very surprised about the homeless people here and that they can not get health ah benefits or nothing and [mn] much of them die on the streets that's that do- doesn't happen in germany 

473.41 475.94 B: you're saying there aren't any homeless people in germany 

475.51 484.99 A: there are no homeless people ah the state gives ah everybody the money and the place to live and food and ah 

483.77 485.90 B: oh so they have public housing there as well 

485.79 496.64 A: yeah public housing and even ah if they are not working they are receiving like um like one thousand dollars from the state each month yes 

494.53 496.89 B: oh really just for money just to 

496.80 505.55 A: yeah yeah and so they can survive so ah and the people th- who are mental illnesses they 

496.91 498.93 B: go do whatever eat or whatever 

505.54 516.48 A: ah there are good institutions to gain them back to the ah society [noise] so um every german or even if you are um 

516.55 521.55 A: there if you are not a german but living there you have all this protection 

521.52 533.72 A: um but i hope not to get suddenly ill this ah spring [laughter] ah yeah and this is this is a good conversation that to remind us that we must be careful in 

526.82 527.91 B: yeah 

533.23 535.08 B: oh yes sir absolutely 

533.71 538.52 A: (( yeah [laughter] isn't it )) 

535.53 546.86 B: particularly when you have things like you know like ah we had recently that whole thing with sars in like at toronto and it's getting getting close and you know and a lot of people with bad immune systems were dying off from that 

543.19 546.17 A: (( yeah )) 

546.72 547.72 A: uh-huh 

547.03 548.60 B: you know when you get ah ah 

548.66 555.12 B: a sickness introduced from another part of the world that you don't have any kind of immunity to it's it can really be bad 

555.08 556.80 A: yeah 

555.35 563.17 B: like you seem to get all every couple of years something like that comes from asia that ah can can can really be dair- dire to some people 

558.76 561.99 A: (( yeah [noise] it's )) 

562.67 576.02 A: interesting that ah what you say like in every couple of years there's a new illness and ah they beat the illness and two years later there there comes something else form asia or africa or somewhere else 

575.60 578.65 B: yeah yeah some- the far corners of the world it 

576.03 577.40 A: (( that's interesting )) 

577.92 585.87 A: (( yeah it's like a you know it's [laughter] interesting yeah yeah )) 

582.10 590.01 B: yeah yeah it's a it's a little scary with how how global the world is and people transport it all over the world shipping and so forth 

587.85 599.89 A: mm yeah uh-huh so i heard that the united states that ah president bush um will give fifteen billion dollars to the h._i._v. research in africa
