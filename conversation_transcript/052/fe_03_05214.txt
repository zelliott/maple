291.28 293.18 A: and you still got diabetes 

293.21 298.39 B: it doesn't come from eating it comes from a it comes from [mn] other things it's genetic 

298.36 300.82 A: i thought that um like i knew 

300.06 303.32 B: if you oh you mean if you overeat and you're obese maybe 

302.90 304.02 A: yeah 

303.43 307.01 B: but there's other factors that come into ah come into play too 

307.08 309.64 A: it has to do with the different types of diabetes right 

309.25 314.55 B: well there's only type one and type two type one is juvenile type two is ah adult onset 

314.19 316.51 A: hm

349.73 350.68 B: yeah 

350.49 351.88 A: were you drafted

363.11 365.39 B: yes army army reserves 

365.09 367.62 A: and why would they not send you to vietnam then 

367.20 372.63 B: because you're in the reserves your unit has to be activated and our unit wasn't activated 

372.57 375.77 A: but you would think that if they're drafting people that aren't even 

374.89 380.06 B: i wasn't drafted i ah i enlisted in the reserves which is a different that's a difference 

380.23 383.51 A: s- so then you stayed at home

391.34 393.57 A: yeah but i thought that the reserves 

392.90 407.20 B: that's only when you're on active duty and then you get discharged you have to st- you have ah go into the reserves i just joined the reserves right away so i didn't have to worry about getting drafted 'cause there wasn't any the only way you could go was your whole unit got called up and it never happened 

407.33 411.68 A: okay but there is a possibility that you could that that that your whole unit goes 

409.34 410.28 B: no 

411.26 414.75 B: yeah very very slim very slim 

414.89 424.73 A: okay because one of my friends was ah he went into the marine reserves and he actually had to you know with the whole iraq thing had to you know stop what he was doing he got called

461.86 462.82 B: yeah 

465.82 473.09 B: no did yeah the people they let go they they lost douglas and a couple of other people and that that's gonna hurt 'em 

468.27 469.53 A: exactly 

472.41 474.52 A: it's because they wouldn't sign them 

473.98 481.64 B: right they didn't wanna pay 'em the money they wanted so they let 'em they let 'em walk so about five people they lost and mitchell went to the giants 

481.42 484.88 A: ah the number one punt returner i can't believe that 

484.46 487.02 B: right and what about douglas 

486.86 489.50 A: yeah he was he's a pro baller 

489.09 491.91 B: (( yeah [mn] that's gonna hurt )) 

491.36 496.84 A: i mea the eagles were known for their solid defence and if you're gonna let one of the key defe- defensive players go 

496.59 500.41 B: yeah well that's the eagles that's that's the way they do things 

500.19 502.73 A: i mean come on could we go to one super bowl please 

502.53 505.54 B: it's not hey to you're gonna have to wait a while 

504.96 506.64 A: [laughter] 

506.24 507.88 B: maybe not this year 

507.46 511.69 A: [laughter] probably not i mean it it's i think it's all downhill from now 

511.48 514.52 B: sure it is they might not even make the play offs 

514.40 519.53 A: ah i think they'll make the play offs but ah i think last year was their year and they 

515.87 516.77 B: yeah 

519.29 521.79 B: they blew the game against tampa bay 

521.20 523.89 A: yeah plus mcnabb was hurt [mn] oh man 

522.12 522.99 B: they sh- 

523.32 525.68 B: that that they should have won that game 

526.59 532.08 B: they won that they they ah let that running back go to the giants dorsey levens 

531.68 532.92 A: yeah 

532.60 542.28 B: and now they ah they don't wanna ah ah extend the contract of ah duce staley and ah taylor they lose th- those two guys they're really gonna be in trouble 

541.82 544.77 A: well i think they're relying on correll buckhalter 

544.33 548.44 B: oh they can't rely on him he's he was out for a whole year 

547.79 552.16 A: yeah i did i do remember his rookie year though he was good until he did get hurt 

550.90 554.37 B: yeah he was he was good and these was a couple of other players 

554.50 559.56 B: ho- ah hollis thomas he he was injured twice he may not play again there was another guy 

559.60 566.70 B: another defensive guy that's um supposed to come back but once you're injured it's very doubtful whether you're gonna play again 

566.34 569.07 A: that's true it it depends if you're gonna recover or not 

568.66 570.34 B: how serious it is 

570.01 574.08 A: which is why personally i didn't think mcnabb should've even played in that the next games 

573.32 575.12 B: nah he shouldn't have 

574.49 582.21 A: because he broke his ankle and he comes back after six weeks i mean you're gonna start playing full full throttle on a broken ankle it's just 

575.82 576.89 B: right 

577.74 578.71 B: right 

581.21 595.76 B: well well besides that they're weak in certain defensive positions middle linebacker they're weak at the running back they're weak at the at the tight end tight end and wide receiver they have too many holes ah that they haven't addressed ah for them to go anywhere 

588.04 589.55 A: wide receiver [mn] 

595.85 599.95 B: and if that coach is deluding himself andy reid if he thinks they're gonna go anywhere they they're not
