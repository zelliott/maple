0.15 2.18 B: hi my name's randy 

1.32 3.25 A: hello my name's doug 

3.10 4.90 B: good to meet you doug 

5.05 14.22 B: okay let's see ah talking about illness and the changing weather and how it affects it i've noticed that when the weather changes a lot in a [noise] period of time that i'm 

14.13 20.08 B: prone to get ill like if it's hot really hot one day and then cold the next but i think that's because the body's trying to adapt 

20.29 22.07 A: yeah 

23.61 25.05 B: um 

25.45 30.68 B: that and also it affects changes in plants and which also put more pollen into the air 

31.01 35.68 B: [noise] and that would cause allergies to act up which would which would weaken the immune system as 

37.46 41.38 A: right and then some people do have to work outside in the weather 

38.17 41.00 B: (( well )) 

41.25 47.07 B: [noise] oh yeah [noise] probably half the people on the planet have to work outside 

46.42 47.63 A: oh yes 

48.41 50.02 A: not everybody's ah 

50.35 53.36 A: lucky in getting a cush job in a office somewhere 

52.85 53.66 B: (( ha )) 

54.83 60.74 B: i think there's advantages to both types of jobs too i mean granted you're probably more prone to get ill in an outside job 

61.06 64.39 B: 'cause you're exposed to weather but there's different illnesses inside too 

64.93 65.78 A: right 

65.15 67.90 B: that come from like ventilation systems [mn] 

68.31 69.29 A: oh yes 

68.35 73.34 B: and you're more cl- prone to be close to other people be sick inside as well 

73.22 77.43 A: well your outside people working would probably ah 

73.92 74.52 B: (( [noise] )) 

77.78 82.88 A: be a little bit healthier getting out there and working and stuff so they would not 

83.13 87.27 A: i i would think that their immune system would be a little bit better 

87.45 92.22 B: that's true and [mn] probably people that are outside working more probably have to eat a little bit better 

92.39 93.32 A: (( mm )) 

92.43 94.49 B: to keep their bodies up 

93.95 95.75 A: correct 

96.17 101.30 B: 'cause the average person sitting working inside in an inside office is probably only eating 

101.41 111.02 B: always fat always eating fast food a lot of coffee and if they're drinking a lot of coffee coffee has things in it that break down the immune system as well 

111.36 113.87 A: oh i didn't know that 

112.46 114.58 B: [noise] yeah there's um 

115.01 116.28 B: in coffee 

116.84 123.00 B: [mn] one of the characteristics of caffeine and there's another chemical in it as well it breaks down the vitamin c. in your body 

124.49 126.09 A: (( hm )) 

124.85 130.71 B: the only reason i remember that is my mother majored in nutrition and she kind of put all those things in my head 

128.32 129.65 A: [laughter] 

131.17 132.62 B: she'd like 

131.26 133.45 A: so you don't drink coffee then do you 

133.44 140.33 B: not too often i mean i i like good c- i'm like really picky on coffee and i only drink it on weekends 

139.98 141.25 A: (( hm )) 

143.04 148.41 A: but ah yeah i i think people working outdoors um would be a lot healthier 

148.82 155.46 A: um because they're out there and they're used to it and they keep their body bet- in better shape 

155.09 161.52 B: that's i i i would agree with you on that because when i was working outside i was in a lot better health than 

161.76 164.58 B: before i was started working indoors 

164.76 168.34 B: so me i was out there i was going god i hate sweating out here 

168.45 175.21 B: and then i started getting edcu- started trying to get more education to go in- work inside and a lot more hassle 

168.47 169.53 A: (( mhm )) 

175.50 177.12 A: right 

178.46 186.60 A: but you know if you stop and think about it a lot of people [mn] inside ah just from the air conditioning will get sick 

187.44 190.44 A: you know from the coldness of the air conditioning so 

187.59 189.36 B: yeah 

191.16 199.51 B: plus also if if there's the really cool air conditioning it's hot outside and it's hot and humid their body's going through all those temperature differences it'll put a lot of stress on the body 

195.75 196.49 A: (( mm )) 

199.37 200.37 A: correct 

202.40 205.77 B: if you're outside you're exposed to stuff more often so 

205.78 212.25 B: yeah you you may get you may get sick early on a lot but once your body adapts to it probably won't get sick too often 

212.61 216.30 A: oh yeah and it also depends where you're at also 

216.83 218.19 B: that's true too 

217.43 220.02 A: i mean if you're in the south or in the north 

221.79 226.05 B: [noise] yeah [mn] one thing that kind of helped me also is i was in the navy for ten years 

225.42 226.64 A: mhm 

226.06 233.17 B: and getting exposed to people from all 'round the country at first i got really really sick because there's different illnesses to different areas 

233.88 245.93 B: and it took me a long time to get used to it and then now i was i'm originally from california and i got used to all the illnesses that are common out there but then getting exposed to people from the east from the south or from the mid west 

246.19 249.66 B: i got exposed to their illnesses and my body'd never seen that before 

250.47 254.72 A: oh yeah i was in the marine corp for three years so i know what you're talking about 

254.77 260.58 B: yeah once you get start getting exposed to all those new people then get their new illnesses then it breaks you down 

260.73 266.40 B: plus you're also getting exposed to a new climate in the military too when you relocate 'cause the climate's complete- [mn] 

266.45 269.92 B: out here in new england we we had seven months of snow 

270.94 272.52 A: seven months 

271.90 276.33 B: yeah it start- it just it's just stopped snow it stopped snowing last month 

276.34 287.68 B: like well not not last month the month before last but it was raining it stopped s- it stopped snowing april and then it's just been raining today it's raining so bad that in fact i was just dr- driving home a few minutes ago 

287.54 291.41 B: i couldn't see more than maybe ten feet in front of my head 

291.44 293.25 A: is it snowing up there now 

292.91 294.97 B: nah just raining real hard 

294.17 295.81 A: just raining real hard okay 

295.71 298.19 B: yeah i couldn't see nothing 

297.02 299.92 A: i think we had what one day of snow here 

299.78 300.69 B: wow 

302.26 304.42 A: in the panhandle of florida 

303.85 304.91 B: oh okay 

305.31 307.51 B: you don't see too much snow down there anyway 

307.32 311.02 A: now every once in a while we'll see it but it doesn't usually stick 

311.69 315.88 B: i've only been down to florida a couple of times i remembered it seemed like it rained the same time every day 

316.64 320.07 A: yes ah in the summer months you get those ah 

320.18 325.42 A: heat waves and stuff and 'bout every afternoon it's it'll start raining 

325.51 329.77 A: and see that's another bad thing especially for the in- pe- people that work indoors ah if 

330.08 337.79 A: they do go out to luch or something and then get in that wet weather and then get back inside in that air conditioning their clothes are all wet 

339.02 346.43 B: [noise] i think the humidity down there too because you'd have more pr- you'd have like fungus getting inside of the air conditioning vents as well 

339.08 339.93 A: and 

345.35 348.60 A: yes the humidity's a lot different 

350.23 357.75 B: yeah 'cause it if if it's that hot outside it's that cool inside it's gonna condense a lot you're gonna get a lot of moisture i would think inside the ventilation systems 

357.58 358.56 A: you do 

357.91 365.19 B: people'll be getting sick i i'm surprised people don't get sick all the time down there from that unless you have a lot of people going around cleaning up all the air conditioning ducts 

365.90 371.17 A: well ah there again your immune system starts to get used to it after a while 

370.64 373.87 B: that's true too yeah i guess it would 

372.84 377.22 A: ah i mean i've lived in florida since eighty one so 

378.84 382.87 A: i'm originally from up in michigan so there was a big difference 

383.77 388.41 A: as far as getting used to the the humidity and the heat and everything 

389.83 393.50 B: yeah bet bet it took a little while to adapt 

393.01 396.16 A: well it took a little while not not too bad 

395.89 399.91 B: 'cause i remember i was going through like school when i was in the navy i did it in memphis 

400.01 403.34 B: and it's pretty humid out there i thought i was gonna grow gills and breathe like a fish 

403.16 405.11 A: (( [laughter] )) 

404.71 407.60 B: i thought i was gonna get heat stroke or something in the summer there 

408.62 411.18 A: oh yeah it can get hot 

412.89 416.04 B: about how hot does it get down there 

415.27 416.68 A: um 

417.14 420.04 A: just the other day i was ah 

421.20 427.87 A: somebody was telling me 'cause they were looking at a thermometer in their in their vehicle which shows the outside temperature and it was a hundred and fifteen 

427.57 428.84 B: wow 

429.86 436.97 B: and just yesterday yesterday was really hot here well hot for here anyway it was it was about ninety yesterday 

436.57 437.96 A: mhm 

437.30 444.34 B: but up until yesterday i'd say for the most part it's been like sixty five seventy and raining 

444.37 451.76 B: and like a month ago it down in the forties and back before like april and before w- we were getting in the negatives 

449.73 450.70 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

452.80 458.97 A: oh yeah now you got this little heatwave if you wanna call it that and then all of a sudden it's gonna cool down again 

458.47 473.35 B: oh yeah it it i don't think we're even gonna get a real summer up here i think a lot of people are gonna get sick because of that i think it also causes i think if you don't see enough sun makes people get depressed 'cause i remember when i was ah stationed up in washington and it rained three days out of the week out there 

470.72 471.65 A: mhm 

473.30 474.46 A: right 

473.89 483.74 B: and people would get s- and people would get really depressed and i think that would also weaken their immune systems too 'cause i remember people getting sick a lot more up there 

483.65 488.28 A: [noise] [noise] oh yeah if you well you gotta be ah your body's gotta be up and your 

488.67 497.37 A: i i feel that your your attitude has to be up a lot too i mean you're feeling good then your body's feeling good 

493.62 494.98 B: yeah 'cause i know some pe- 

496.84 503.26 B: yeah people let themselves get down they get all worn down they're moping around their bodies weaken up 

502.98 504.34 A: (( right [noise] )) 

506.10 517.34 A: well problem is down here in the south is you know they get outside and start working and everything they get over exhausted and then their immune system sort of breaks down a little bit 

520.11 528.28 B: that's makes sense yeah ah yeah if you if you're getting exhausted and yeah your body doesn't have energy to keep up your immune system 

521.54 522.24 A: [noise] 

523.69 524.79 A: right 

528.36 535.78 A: [noise] and that's where some of 'em get sick but [noise] but once you get used to it you learn how to pace yourself and how to work it 

537.23 549.81 A: but if somebody you know like if you came down here and just all of a sudden got an outdoors job and worked a eight hour [noise] ah job working outdoors you'd just be so exhausted you wouldn't even wanna get up the next [noise] morning [noise] 

549.39 553.15 B: oh yeah i especially if your body's not used to the humidity 

550.11 551.16 A: because you 

552.02 554.33 A: right 'cause you're not used to it 

554.36 559.96 B: i mean i've [mn] last year i was doing outside work here up here i was doing some demolition work 

560.23 575.08 B: on buildings and moving big chunks of concrete and i i i remember it was [mn] it it took a while to get used to it but once i did i mean it it didn't really get all that humid out here th- last year i was kind of surprised it was it was really hot 

575.66 580.43 B: but it wasn't too humid [mn] and from what i'm gathering i've only lived here for like two years 

580.64 583.08 B: that normally it gets really humid up here 

584.53 585.51 A: (( hm [noise] )) 

585.63 592.42 B: in the summer and it's i mean it gets really extreme up here too i think that's one of the reasons why i've gotten sicker here 

592.66 594.75 B: than some of the other places i've been 

595.02 597.88 B: is because it goes from such an extreme 

597.95 599.89 B: but you know this last winter i think we went down
