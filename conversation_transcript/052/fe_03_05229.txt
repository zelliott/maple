43.15 44.26 B: (( hi fred )) 

51.89 57.81 B: here's what i thought they were talking about and let me ask you if you kind of got the same impression 

58.47 60.23 B: the question was 

61.08 63.37 B: i thought it was first of all 

63.54 66.66 B: whether we- we get sick often 

66.77 68.71 A: oh right right right 

66.96 67.84 B: and 

68.00 76.04 B: secondly whether there are certain things that we th- think are effective at preventing us from getting sick 

74.74 86.33 A: oh right right right yes it was something you see i have a cell phone and it you know i i thought it was a real good cell phone but i don't know whether it could you hear me okay 

86.55 88.03 B: i can hear you fine 

87.85 90.23 A: oh okay because i'm outside 

90.50 102.51 A: 'cause when i inside it's i think maybe all the steel framing or whatever it is that's a little distorted or something like that so i usually go outside using the a 

102.73 104.09 A: the cell phone 

104.07 104.97 B: okay 

104.16 106.38 A: (( yes okay ah )) 

106.88 108.06 A: (( um )) 

107.70 113.66 B: i suspect actually that may be part of the purpose of this survey that's my suspicion 

114.12 125.05 A: right right it's ah sometimes it would break up or like you know de- dead zone or whatever it is are you ah are you talking with a cell phone too 

121.74 122.55 B: mhm

130.57 134.78 B: so basically on the subject of um illness though 

135.40 139.02 B: i have to say that i am almost never sick 

139.22 140.46 A: i see 

140.71 145.46 A: i haven't been sick for about a year or two [laughter] you know i

144.53 146.22 B: that's pretty good 

145.70 157.79 A: i i guess i've been taking multi vitamins and things like that and vitamin c. to try to prevent from getting a cold but i'm well you know since i'm in florida 

157.77 166.93 A: florida i don't really get too much of a cold because i don't really get into deep cold weather like you guys in cincinnati right [laughter] 

166.63 173.97 B: right well yeah we're not that far south we're i mean cincinnati's right on the border of ohio and kentucky so 

174.11 184.37 B: we're reasonably far south we're probably as far south as you are maybe not but we- we're pretty far south we're as far south as washington d._c. 

184.47 193.71 B: it gets it gets it gets cold enough but it doesn't get down to zero really you know it's just about freezing but not down to zero but um 

184.61 185.90 A: oh 

189.40 190.43 A: uh-huh 

194.17 198.21 B: but yeah at least in florida you probably don't have any trouble with getting orange juice 

198.26 202.08 A: [laughter] right i can pretty you know um 

202.09 208.97 A: you know warm weather basically you know really i don't really see too much of cold really cold so 

208.38 209.96 B: mhm so 

209.09 210.58 A: um 

210.17 213.57 B: you basically feel that you don't really get sick so 

213.56 228.38 A: no i don't really get that that often get sick not that much you know like i said you know i haven't been really getting sick much but do wh- what do you take you ta- you take any ah like anything during the week you know like ah to 

223.48 224.23 B: i 

228.22 230.28 A: prevent you from getting sick 

229.92 230.79 B: no 

230.95 234.09 B: i don't do anything i don't take any 

234.13 235.09 A: and the 

234.52 238.19 B: i i do drink orange juice but that's because i like orange juice 

237.88 239.06 A: right 

238.50 243.00 B: um so i probably have a glass of orange juice you know maybe th- 

243.05 245.97 B: three or four glasses of orange juice per week 

246.08 248.71 B: um i don't take any vitamins 

248.91 249.93 B: um 

250.78 259.87 B: i don't i mean i i eat a lot of fruits and vegetables i have a very high fat diet i mean i eat pounds and pounds of cheese a week 

256.68 257.73 A: uh-huh 

260.08 263.42 B: um maybe four or five pounds of cheese a week 

263.72 264.99 B: but um 

265.16 268.93 B: i i'm pretty active so i burn up a lot of calories 

268.81 269.70 A: oh 

268.99 270.06 B: but um 

270.49 272.32 B: but i 

272.57 278.35 B: i'm almost never sick and when i am sick really all i do is i just i normally go to 

278.72 280.59 B: (( sleep for maybe three )) 

280.71 282.75 B: or four hours per day 

282.85 284.10 A: (( right )) 

283.28 285.41 B: i don't i don't sleep very much 

285.42 292.19 B: and if i get sick the only thing i do is i try and make sure that i stay get at least seven or eight hours of sleep 

292.39 302.97 A: i see that's what i i normally try to get about eight to ten hours well i since i i'm retired from the post office you know i did thirty years in the post office 

296.79 297.70 B: sure 

300.28 301.11 B: uh-huh 

302.53 303.36 B: uh-huh 

302.82 317.32 A: and now i've been getting kind of you know longer sleep i i i like while i was working ah i had just about seven or eight hours but now since i've retired i sleep a little bit later 

317.13 326.32 A: and of course i don't have to set an alarm clock so now i get up about maybe you know seven thirty instead of six thirty in the morning 

326.46 333.29 A: you know and maybe i guess that's maybe preventing me from ca- getting all sick now you know 

332.94 334.20 B: mhm 

333.59 342.79 A: so um nah you know since now i don't have no alarm clock so i sleep a little bit later so that's getting into the nine 

343.40 345.73 A: almost nine hours of sleep 

345.85 346.70 B: mhm 

346.06 350.51 A: but i i don't really get too much of sleep in the like 

350.45 362.86 A: going to bed at nine o'clock it's usually about between like well i go to bed about twelve o'clock and go get up about maybe eight or nine o'clock 

362.63 370.14 A: so it's it's the extension of sleep so maybe that's really preventing me from getting sick too [laughter] you know 

369.18 371.78 B: well let me let me ask you this fred 

371.15 371.98 A: yeah 

371.92 379.69 B: after you start doing this do you think that you- you're getting sick less than you than you were before when you were sleeping less 

379.67 391.31 A: oh well i i think it's maybe the extra hours and now i'm really doing more than really a job i'm trying to get into fitness you know walk more 

389.67 393.95 B: but do you think you're getting do you think you're getting sick less often 

393.82 395.71 A: yes that's because 

394.65 398.42 B: okay so it is having a positive impact 

398.71 409.97 A: yeah that could be that could be you know one factor that preventing sickness is getting more rest and more of um 

410.16 419.68 A: activities you're doing more activities that are not really pertaining to a job i don't know i'm more of a now of the out 

418.59 419.49 B: of course 

419.62 427.89 A: outdoors type of person that now i'm doing more outside work than really basically doing inside you know 

427.63 428.68 B: mhm 

428.33 431.55 A: i don't know maybe that could be a factor for preventing 

430.83 437.20 B: yeah and perhaps now that you're not working you don't feel as stressed and maybe that is a factor also 

436.36 449.30 A: could be less stressful too you know getting you know because you always have a clock to set you know now i don't have a clock and that could be a stressful factor that also you know 

449.63 452.00 A: you know preventing sickness 

452.87 453.79 B: mhm 

453.16 456.42 A: but um are are you still working 

457.08 462.25 B: yes i had a different job i had a pretty high powered job

486.61 500.43 A: oh that's that's neat that's you know that's re- i like you see i like the sense of going outdoors and now i'm trying to go into national parks and doing you know just just doing different ah 

499.94 501.18 B: mhm 

500.69 512.53 A: ah just to go out there and just going on a nature trail you know what i mean it's just like i read a you know doing things in the out you know ah going 

506.05 506.97 B: sure 

512.44 519.61 A: right now i'm trying to get my plan is going to visit different states going to the national parks 

519.51 530.06 A: and just just getting out outdoors instead of more of more of just staying into you know ah 

523.11 523.97 B: mhm 

530.17 537.80 A: malls and things like that i'm more of an outdoor person really going out there seeing animals and things like that and maybe that's 

537.95 546.18 A: the best thing is ah to get away maybe you know the environment is getting you sick i don't know i'm not more of a 

546.68 548.58 A: a city dweller you know 

548.33 562.84 B: yeah i couldn't tell you because i never really was sick much but i commend you for that i mean that's what i do pretty much for a living i think a lot of the state parks and i'm pretty partial but the kind of parks i work in i think they're pretty good too so 

562.48 563.68 A: i see 

562.78 566.19 B: i think there's a lot of good opportunities 

566.29 572.64 B: out there and ah it sounds like whatever you're doing is it's working if you're not being 

571.96 581.72 A: [laughter] yeah right i y- you know that is you know they're saying that if you go out and enjoy people and you know and just 

581.72 587.40 A: doing the nature of it type of thing you know you're getting less stress you know 

587.43 592.47 A: that's what i think the stress is a factor of illness too really 

592.24 598.63 B: uh-huh so basically so basically one of the things i thought the question asked was whether
