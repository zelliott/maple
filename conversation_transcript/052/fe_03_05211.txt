309.98 313.19 A: yeah i figure it's ea- it's it's it's worth it 

313.23 320.32 A: to to avoid it it's so much easier just to be careful than to ah to go through the suffering of being ill 

320.49 325.86 B: now how long how long are you gonna be um in your in your 

325.51 333.92 A: oh originally they told me it would only be four to five months but it's already been it's over fifteen months

370.91 378.37 A: wasn't until two hours later when i returned home that ah and it was warm where i realised i couldn't get up 

378.31 379.82 B: oh wow 

378.88 381.78 A: ah i had not control over the leg anymore 

382.96 388.96 B: wow i mean do you did you you still have usage of that leg or is it 

383.79 384.35 A: (( [mn] )) 

387.78 397.37 A: ah i can use it i'm for rehab i'm now able to to put some weight on it i'm not allowed to carry anything my ri- on the right side of my body 

393.84 394.64 B: okay

399.01 400.43 A: yeah 

400.19 401.16 B: okay 

400.58 404.30 A: and also i can't twist can't turn 

404.53 406.39 A: therefore it's ah 

406.62 410.35 A: it would put extra strain i could could injure it further 

410.79 411.85 B: okay 

412.08 414.18 B: but i mean 

414.90 418.61 B: so i mean are you on on a wheelchair or crutches or 

418.30 423.48 A: no no no i'm trying to ah walk on my own in order to develop the strength i had been 

422.92 425.15 B: mhm 

424.00 434.40 A: but at this point i'm trying to walk on my own because if i use any assistance it doesn't ah give the muscles the ah the exercise they need 

434.70 437.51 B: but you can't walk very long 

436.61 445.13 A: no no no no or very fast i can only put the right foot about a foot foot and a half length in front of the left 

445.11 445.90 B: (( mm ))

450.84 452.66 B: yeah 

451.25 453.11 A: have to keep it bent 

452.78 454.98 B: yeah

457.44 462.37 A: i can straight now when i'm laying down but i can't straighten it out when i'm standing 

464.00 469.53 B: [mn] so i mean how's your mental health like being cooped up 

467.57 474.30 A: oh it's fine it's fine everybody wonders how how i'm doing so well considering i've been stuck at home for fifteen months 

473.98 476.19 B: yeah i mean i would think that um 

476.20 486.32 B: i would be worried less about your physical fit- fitness versus the the state of mind of just being home alone for fifteen months cooped up 

484.36 485.51 A: i don't mind 

486.32 487.57 A: (( i ah ))

503.20 507.44 A: and ah i can't stay still i have to keep the leg moving 

507.45 514.92 A: so i move the leg back and forth bend it straighten it bend it straighten it if i keep it st- if i don't move it it tightens up 

514.42 515.70 B: yeah
