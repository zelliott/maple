0.55 1.65 B: hello 

1.70 3.43 A: norman rose hi 

3.13 6.84 B: hi um i guess we're talking about food 

6.25 9.76 A: uh yeah i think the topic is specifically 

9.84 16.07 A: uh which would you rather eat at a restaurant or at home and your perfect meal 

16.32 17.40 B: um 

17.52 18.80 B: i'd rather 

19.14 23.19 B: eat at home um probably because 

23.24 33.81 B: you're more comfortable at home and you have your like your home environment and you can probably watch t._v. and whatever you want to watch and bring a movie um 

34.15 37.29 B: i like lasagna and french fries personally 

37.34 38.62 B: um 

38.77 42.77 B: and um wait are you supposed to be talking or is it just me the whole time 

42.89 44.26 A: oh it's it's both of us 

44.02 46.22 B: okay yeah um 

44.53 47.47 A: i think i think i think we're supposed to have like a conversation [mn] 

46.76 50.24 B: okay yeah so i mean it do do you like eating at home 

50.72 56.60 A: oh you know i i think the the question to this predicates uh another one which is uh that 

57.04 58.40 A: uh [mn] 

59.01 71.30 A: it it's uh or actually it predicates a number of them like you you have a number of factors to it like o- one is the the comfort like okay are you more comfortable eating at home or in a restaurant you know what it indicates to you like like you if you go to restaurants 

67.29 68.41 B: right 

71.82 79.37 A: uh are you more likely to taste your food you know [mn] you mean you know how sometimes you're you're sitting at home if you're in the same location that you're normally in 

79.49 87.30 A: uh doing the same thing that you normally do sometimes you you don't actually get a chance to taste your food you sort of eat it it's in front of you you eat it you do something else 

86.75 87.59 B: true 

87.56 94.01 A: uh whereas if you go to a restaurant [laughter] i.e. i- if you're you know paying for it basically uh or 

92.66 93.38 B: right 

94.32 108.29 A: uh so there's there's there's a quality of that there's also the qu- the question of you know do you get good food at home uh if you're you know a typical college student like i am for example [laughter] your diet consists of a lot of rama noodles uh [mn] so 

99.94 100.82 B: right 

107.41 108.24 B: right 

108.41 112.03 A: your your your fare it's not like would be very good if you stay at home 

111.66 112.47 B: true 

112.41 116.81 A: uh on the other hands uh [mn] i don't know me i 

117.06 122.36 A: guess i'd rather eat at home uh but mainly just because uh i enjoy cooking yeah 

120.99 121.83 B: right 

122.37 124.31 A: uh it sort of um 

126.31 132.57 A: what can you uh what can you uh what can you throw together with the stuff in the house uh it's really like a it it's an experiment 

126.34 127.09 B: (( good )) 

127.27 128.06 B: [laughter] 

132.00 135.48 B: right exactly i mean [mn] i i mean [mn] 

135.71 136.81 B: i 

136.60 147.58 B: like e- even if it's like a date i'm going on like eating at home sometimes is really good just because you can like cook together and work on stuff and sit down and you know [mn] 

147.40 154.40 B: you know it's gonna be like a comfortable environment and you can get up and get more and also it's free you know so 

153.99 160.80 A: [laughter] yeah yeah al- although although i and i don't want at the risk of going off topic a little bit here i think i think that uh 

154.86 156.10 B: i mean that 

159.31 160.05 B: yeah 

160.89 165.94 A: i sometimes if you're going on a date you you you would want like a restaurant for example to provide a 

165.93 176.67 A: a setting that was a little more neutral well it's it's like you know if if you're going in a first date with someone you don't say come over to my house we'll have some dinner and has has very sort of aggressive overtones 

176.19 177.26 B: right 

176.57 182.94 A: you you you'd want to meet somewhere neutral hey we can go for coffee or [mn] go out meet you at this restaurant here uh 

183.36 189.33 A: so i i i think that's you know depending on the social situation it may be s- similar to a faux pas to 

189.09 190.12 B: right 

189.56 197.27 A: uh to like come over to your house per se but but yeah yeah i i agree it's it's it's it's often sort of more cosy also 

197.85 201.13 A: at the risk of kowtowing to the great american gods of multitasking 

201.09 201.86 B: (( [laughter] )) 

201.14 212.19 A: you can also you can eat and then watch a movie you know just [mn] eat and then it's it's easy to serve way into something else uh if if you're at home whereas if you're at a restaurant 

207.35 208.13 B: right 

208.78 209.77 B: exactly 

212.53 225.34 A: you know the the the meal is sort of uh a big thing uh you you you go you sit down and you order this you order this and you eat the meal pay the bill then you get up and go you're at home you know you you go home 

218.74 219.52 B: eat 

220.00 220.80 B: right 

225.26 229.42 A: uh [mn] you you you get to you get to cook the meal uh you can 

229.63 233.40 A: you can watch a movie you can take a bath [laughter] 

232.31 241.46 B: right you can eat and you can just sit there you know you can just relax you don't have to get up you don't have to clean up you just you just sit there do what you want to do relax and then whenever 

234.90 236.79 A: (( exactly you know you )) 

237.61 239.09 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

240.63 245.76 A: if you like eating in spandex that's fine if you like eating in your ballroom gown that's fine 

242.72 243.92 B: exactly 

245.24 259.66 B: exactly it's it's more yeah it's more homey you know it's just is it [mn] i mean rather i mean i'd rather eat like when i'm more comfortable you know and like at restaurants like people could be watching you or just rela- i mean you can you can do anything you want at home you know so i mean 

246.13 247.46 A: (( uh there's [mn] )) 

259.47 262.32 B: i'd rather eat in that environment 

261.70 266.57 A: yeah i think i think it certainly provides for for more relaxation well let's see if we can uh [mn] 

266.33 272.33 A: let's see if we can't m- marshall some more arguments on the side of uh on the side of restaurants here i mean we- we've got lots of reasons to eat at home 

272.00 272.74 B: (( okay )) 

272.12 281.68 A: i mean what's the reason for what's the reason to eat out i mean gen- generally you get better food this this i can't really [laughter] i like to cook but i'm generally not as good as the stuff you get at the store 

277.59 278.44 B: (( well uh )) 

281.32 293.69 B: right i mean but also at restaurants it's also good because i mean you can you can eat different things and it's not always about putting in more effort you know you just you just sit there and wait while your meal's cooked and catered to you 

293.50 302.69 B: so it's just sometimes if if you're lazy it's good to go to a restaurant and you can always try something new like sushi if you can't make that then you go there and you can try it you know 

302.51 313.74 A: [mn] mhm and it also gives you a chance to sort of expand your horizons like for example if if i don't know how to make sushi uh then if i sit at home if i make dinner for myself every night i'm never gonna have sushi unless 

306.62 307.65 B: exactly 

313.03 314.18 B: right 

313.76 317.25 A: you know i go out and eat some or you know um bring some over 

315.53 316.26 B: right 

316.92 330.76 B: and ea- eating at restaurants is also a more social thing so if you want to go out and meet people see somebody at the restaurant you want to talk to you get a better chance to go out there and talk to people it's a good chance to dress up and and a good excuse to get out get out of the house sometimes 

317.35 318.33 A: uh 

323.59 324.77 A: (( mhm )) 

330.86 343.44 A: yeah it it's [mn] like now i think like i was saying it's it's sort of a socially mutual environment so i mean you you don't have to be best frie- [mn] you know [mn] humans have at least americans have this this particular sort of social 

334.82 335.60 B: right 

343.67 348.93 A: ordering principles wherein if you're not a good friend of someone's you don't get invited over to their house for dinner 

348.63 349.91 B: right exactly 

348.97 362.41 A: well i mean meal uh so so you can take you know but it's okay to go to somewhere that's a little more neutral like a restaurant so if you if you don't you know if you have lunch with your business partners that's great if you want to have a barbecue with your business partners that might be a little funny 

356.39 357.23 B: right 

362.06 363.11 B: correct 

362.46 366.58 A: uh so yeah yeah okay so it's a it's a good meeting place 

366.33 367.35 B: yeah it is 

367.16 368.25 A: (( let's see )) 

367.39 376.44 B: um yeah also yeah you're right [mn] about the meeting place [mn] you wouldn't want to invite somebody back to your house unless like you know them so it's it's a good neutral place to meet up you know 

376.63 383.79 A: mhm yeah i do [mn] it's a i mean generally we think of that uh more more i think i think of that more in bars you know 

377.11 378.45 B: yeah i 

383.97 385.65 A: meeting people that you don't know 

385.31 386.20 B: right 

385.77 390.47 A: uh but it's a good place to to get to know pe- get to know better the people that you know slightly know already 

390.27 391.24 B: of course 

390.86 391.77 A: uh 

391.93 397.16 A: so that i think that's uh i think that they also asked the the second part of the question was um 

397.80 409.67 A: uh the ideal meal that's [laughter] i i'm a baker so it i have i i do a lot of thinking about [laughter] food it it's it's tough to really come up with a good concise answer to that question 

405.14 406.06 B: yeah 

409.85 411.40 B: (( what's your ideal meal )) 

410.11 411.12 A: uh 

411.58 412.15 B: (( [mn] )) 

412.00 416.70 A: [mn] yeah [laughter] gosh um 

414.24 414.80 B: (( [mn] )) 

418.04 423.28 A: i suppose uh it has a lot to do with atmosphere uh the food itself 

421.02 422.47 B: (( mm )) 

423.31 427.74 A: it's it's something i've been learning about well obviously um the food itself is actually 

429.18 436.87 A: you know what the what the food consists of is maybe fifty percent of eating maybe that's generous maybe it's more like forty 

436.84 445.96 A: uh like what the food tastes like uh or or rather what's what's in the food uh like the food itself has has a lot less to do with 

446.15 448.43 A: eating than than we think 

448.52 450.65 A: like for example 

450.75 453.30 A: if i made up say 

453.87 455.16 A: uh 

455.54 456.30 A: mm 

456.45 457.01 B: (( [mn] )) 

457.26 461.56 A: say like a a shortbread like a a couple pieces of shortbread 

461.69 469.15 A: and uh some vanilla custard and i sliced up some fresh strawberries and made the uh [mn] 

469.03 477.55 A: maybe a peach or two and a few slices of mango can't leave the mango off um and i just sort of toss them all on a plate and scramble them up with a fork 

471.97 472.76 B: (( right [mn] )) 

477.28 478.13 B: right 

477.87 481.60 A: uh it's the same stuff as biting into a 

481.67 484.77 A: a uh fruit custard tart but 

483.24 484.34 B: mhm 

484.81 490.21 A: i- i- it's not [laughter] appetizing because it's it's not it's not ordered and um 

486.83 487.87 B: exactly 

490.58 494.11 A: i think you you can extrapol- you can expand on that like if you're eating 

494.41 498.49 A: with uh music that you like playing or if if you're 

498.70 506.88 A: eating certain in an environment which allows you to sort of calm down and just relax and taste what you're eating for example if you're if you're eating at a four five you know five star restaurant 

503.11 503.93 B: right 

507.03 507.89 B: mhm 

507.59 511.50 A: but you know uh you've got deaf metal at full volume in the background 

511.46 512.02 B: (( [mn] )) 

511.53 515.72 A: uh it's it's it's harder to sit and sort of concentrate on on your food 

515.31 516.30 B: exactly 

516.03 520.09 A: uh so i guess to to respond to your question 

520.59 523.68 A: the ambience has to mean has to be right um 

522.77 523.60 B: uh-huh 

524.37 531.15 A: [mn] i guess i would need to be either by myself or with someone i feel very relaxed so it's okay to shut up and eat you 

528.64 529.69 B: right 

531.05 532.06 B: yeah 

531.43 535.95 A: know [mn] you know the the best compliment to the chef is that no one says anything because they're all busy eating 

535.70 536.71 B: right 

536.07 537.81 A: same same idea like [cough] 

538.29 540.89 A: not a lot of people get nervous when you don't talk to them 

540.53 541.53 B: right 

540.92 543.20 A: uh so like all right 

543.24 556.13 B: yeah i mean i i think the best time is to the best way to taste your food is always by yourself because it's so you don't have anybody bugging you asking you oh how's the food how's this how's that like if you cook it yourself and then you eat it yourself i mean you can 

543.28 545.18 A: uh who 

555.94 558.57 B: you know the taste like a hundred percent you know 

559.06 562.88 A: [cough] mhm yeah i i i think that there's it's 

559.92 560.66 B: yeah 

563.69 565.86 A: (( do you eat do you eat do you eat sushi a lot )) 

565.26 566.67 B: yeah i i like fish 

566.72 570.52 A: yeah well they serve the little slices of pickled ginger 

570.35 571.73 B: right yeah 

571.33 580.22 A: to to clean the pallet i think in a way having can be kind of like that it's like the the if you actually stick yourself fully into the experience of eating 

579.88 580.87 B: mhm 

580.25 581.14 A: uh 

581.29 587.07 A: you want to sort of break it up every now and again uh with the experience of you know uh 

583.58 584.34 B: (( sure )) 

587.54 589.18 A: dealing with another person 

589.20 594.23 A: uh or inter- like so basically you you want to stop every once in a while like take a breath 

589.25 590.06 B: right 

594.33 598.89 A: and come up for air and at that point it's nice to have someone there you can just you know talk 

595.66 596.44 B: (( mhm )) 

599.09 599.89 A: (( about what ))
