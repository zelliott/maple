95.20 107.99 A: to to take out iraq's um warring factions and those that would use the uh the oil and the income going in there is by by strengthening the the relationships with uh with the uh middle east 

107.75 108.64 B: right 

107.96 117.46 A: uh the biggest issue i think was in you know in the seventy was it in the seventies when we we when we accepted uh israel as a as a state it

119.87 120.63 A: was 

121.15 130.93 A: think think it was in the seventies um but uh the fact is i mean if if you ask any any any person who's a a devout jew a a a a 

122.71 123.67 B: okay 

131.16 144.86 A: a jew who believes in in the principles of judaism uh they said that they wouldn't be they they would never have a god told them that they wouldn't have a land until the their their um messiah came 

144.29 145.97 B: right that's right 

144.82 155.66 A: and and the zionist movement is the one that ca- actually ca- created that was only after the holocaust i i can understand i mean i would be kinda ticked off at the world in

173.59 175.00 B: right exactly 

175.18 181.50 A: with the income and the diaspora because god knows we have a str- extremely strong diaspora uh um 

181.49 193.36 A: of um uh of of jews in in both in canada and in both and and the states i i you know i can i say support them but i don't say support them at the end of at the at the cost of blood
