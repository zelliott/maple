63.57 78.08 B: the final of i think one of the survivor series so i sat through that with some other friends more to offer moral support than because i was really interested in [laughter] what was going on in the show

97.29 98.52 A: what's that 

97.92 102.34 B: is fear factor what they're talking about when they talk about reality t. v. 

101.27 106.77 A: oh no yeah you're right i think they mean like who wants to marry a millionaire and 

106.26 117.06 B: right 'cause fear factor is that's sort of to me that's that's um would go under the extreme game show [laughter] 

114.59 117.83 A: yeah yeah that one's kinda [laughter] 

117.02 122.74 B: yeah either there's not much real um from what i've seen in that 

119.51 129.10 A: yeah yeah all right yeah okay i got off the off the subject but yeah yeah i got 'em a couple of them there was that other one we watched there it was [mn] 

130.53 132.45 A: married by america 

132.81 134.04 B: okay 

132.95 140.53 A: it was a bunch of good looking people that that claim they couldn't get get a date or laid with a hundred dollar bill or anything and 

139.92 142.53 B: [laughter] 

140.74 152.80 A: and they uh you know then then everybody had to choose you know america had to choose their dates for 'em and and hook 'em up and to me i mean to me that was 

148.17 149.19 B: oh 

150.12 150.95 B: i 

153.14 161.37 A: it was just pretty lame because it was you know good looking people quote unquote you know compared to to others i've seen 

160.99 162.16 B: yeah 

161.55 173.09 A: and uh and they're saying that they're just so hard up and they can't get a date and you know but then on the other hand they're working a hundred hours a week and and uh [laughter] they have no personal life you know 

169.84 171.31 B: [laughter] 

172.42 176.27 B: right and don't have have time to devote to someone else 

175.97 182.30 A: yeah right but you know i mean to me reality t. v. would be uh you know the big 

184.95 190.45 A: you know i mean just stuff like that 'cause everything they show ya on these reality shows is 

190.52 192.00 A: is just uh 

192.50 193.61 B: well i 

193.03 196.05 A: you know it's like picture perfect people 

195.39 202.80 B: well reality t. v. i i think it probably started with m. t. v. when they had their show real world 

200.37 201.87 A: that real world 

202.23 204.76 A: (( and that was just as bad [laughter] )) 

203.71 215.88 B: [laughter] you got um what you you get uh half dozen people together in a house to live rent free and have yourself recorded twenty four seven and see what develops 

210.99 212.07 A: yeah 

215.42 218.82 A: yeah i mean to me uh i don't know i mean 

220.45 232.24 A: it just doesn't interest me [laughter] and i and i don't know why they're so popular with people because i mean something like that that real world i mean that wasn't as bad as like 

222.14 225.85 B: [laughter] 

232.87 245.24 A: because i i used to watch that not on like a daily basis but i i'd catch it and i'm trying to figure out how and now that you've just reminded me of that show because that was something i watched quite a while ago but 

242.45 243.17 B: (( yep )) 

244.84 245.86 B: yeah 

245.27 252.63 A: i think it was just something that was on uh t. v. at a time in a time slot when there was nothing else on 

249.69 252.12 B: [laughter] 

252.37 256.29 B: well speaking of someone who doesn't have cable it's that's not a show 

256.18 258.12 B: that i um 

258.00 261.40 B: that i watched very much i think i saw 

260.60 261.88 A: right 

261.23 275.60 B: parts of an episode once because i've i'm in boston and i think at one point it was filmed in boston and so somebody said hey my house you can sometimes see it in the camera shots when i was over there [laughter] and so that's why i 

265.56 266.51 A: (( yep )) 

271.15 272.90 A: [laughter] 

273.30 274.24 A: (( yep )) 

274.71 278.00 A: you live in boston and don't have cable t. v. huh 

277.60 279.79 B: yeah well i 

278.89 292.29 A: hey there's nothing wrong with that i was i lived with my wife before we were married for probably close to a year and didn't even have a t. v. [laughter] so i mean me myself personally if if i had my choice if 

285.73 288.37 B: [laughter] 

292.28 299.48 A: you know if i could say hey i don't want a t. v. and chuck it out the door i'd i'd be perfectly happy without it 

298.88 300.12 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

299.49 310.68 A: you know i i mean i could fu- i mean right now i'm kinda like a junkie you know like like a crack head because it comes on and yeah okay i i feel compelled to watch it but if it wasn't here i wouldn't 

308.59 309.68 B: (( no that's )) 

310.52 312.21 B: you you've given uh 

310.94 312.84 A: i wouldn't miss it you know 

312.38 318.66 B: probably the one of the top reasons why i do not have cable in my house [laughter] 

316.29 328.59 A: yeah i mean well we got that satellite t. v. but main- the main reason we got it is is my daughter she likes to watch uh the disney shows and stuff and uh 

320.52 321.51 B: (( uh-huh )) 

327.33 328.12 B: (( that's )) 

328.49 330.38 B: that's like what you said then 

328.93 332.04 A: she's she's learned quite a bit from them you know i mean 

333.16 336.50 A: so that's the only reason we have what we have you know [laughter] 

336.04 343.39 B: yeah well i think yeah i think that the reality shows well i know why one reason why they're on a lot 

336.84 337.64 A: but 

343.55 347.77 B: is because they're very inexpensive compared to 

347.47 357.35 A: they're inexpensive but i bet you i'll bet you a million dollars that well i don't have a million dollars but i would bet you know i'd bet ya that that like the uh 

352.99 354.39 B: [laughter] 

357.29 365.79 A: [lipsmack] oh what am i thinking of here not the producers but the the company like the the t. v. channel like c. b. s. fox m. b. c. 

365.03 366.44 B: the network 

365.83 372.46 A: the network there we go thank you the one you know them selling it they're probably making a killing on these shows 

371.39 373.43 B: oh yeah they are 

372.50 387.46 A: because because the ratings are through the roof because people love misery you know and they see these schmucks getting dumped on t. v. and they're loving it so you know instead of a you know a thirty second slot being five hundred thousand hell we can up it to two million 

380.79 382.54 B: [laughter] 

387.30 388.28 B: yeah 

387.31 390.40 A: and and we're gonna you know we're gonna cash in on this 

389.77 398.03 B: and not only that but they don't have to pay i mean how much does it cost to make an episode of friends [laughter] 

394.37 400.59 A: oh yeah oh yeah i mean yeah what are ya talking at least you know [laughter] the bare minimum it's six mil you know 

398.08 398.81 B: (( you know )) 

400.19 412.80 B: oh it's i'm sure it's a lot more than that that's that's with the salary to [laughter] to the actors and when you compare that price to what the price tag is for one of those reality shows 

401.88 404.27 A: oh yeah but that's what i mean [laughter] 

404.58 405.67 A: and uh 

412.78 418.25 B: it's much and and you don't have to deal with actors [laughter] 

415.48 426.09 A: right well yeah i know but yes yeah you get yeah they're making money that way but i i just i don't understand why people like 'em so much you know i mean 

425.67 426.33 B: well 

426.14 429.95 A: i think a lot of 'em are geared for like teenagers 

430.02 433.00 A: and you know i mean i don't know 

432.42 436.09 B: there's there's i think part of the appeal is 

435.93 440.86 B: the thought that people have you know that could be me there these are 

440.28 442.07 A: yeah that's true 

440.70 452.39 B: theoretically real people you know these are just normal people like you and me and everyone else and here they are competing to win a million dollars or 

442.99 444.82 A: yep but i mean 

451.80 464.11 A: [laughter] yeah i know but it's just i i don't know i don't get it i mean for some people to go on like that one we watched was was married by america these these people just weren't happy together 

452.54 453.55 B: or 

463.65 465.10 B: [laughter] 

464.02 473.00 A: and and yet they gotta go on these dates and i mean to me if i'm not happy with somebody i i'm not gonna go on a date with 'em i'm just gonna leave you know [laughter] 

471.85 474.39 B: yeah well but i mean dating 

472.83 479.31 A: but i mean i guess they must've upped the ante or thrown 'em some more money because they stayed on the show 

479.42 486.22 A: instead of just saying i'm out outta here and um yeah i mean 

480.92 482.14 B: (( well also )) 

482.45 490.81 B: uh it's amazing what people will do for the possibility of getting a little bit of money [laughter] 

488.68 498.98 A: and then what was you know i mean we've we've watched 'em and uh i mean that joe millionaire that was another one where all these girls are after this guy because they thought he was a millionaire 

492.34 493.28 B: yeah 

498.83 504.81 A: and these women are like ice if they had bats i mean they would've savagely beat each other 

504.23 506.01 B: [laughter] 

504.78 515.04 A: i mean this is how they were but yet the second they're at the dinner table they're all friends you know and it's it's just it's like i don't know maybe that's what it is people like that they tune in for the 

509.50 510.71 B: yeah 

513.32 518.62 B: peop- people like seeing seeing real life behind the scenes 

515.14 516.63 A: for [laughter] 

518.58 519.63 A: yeah 

518.69 523.21 B: and and and what people are really like given the [laughter] 

521.27 524.20 A: yeah i mean i mean stuff like that i mean 

524.51 530.58 A: i don't it's that that stuff would would piss me off 'cause i don't like two faced people but i mean it is 

530.56 542.93 A: i mean they see you know girl a. and girl b. and they're all fine and dandy but then you put b. and c. together and they're ready to gang up on a. and and you know [laughter] hang her out to dry it's just like 

539.34 540.27 B: and 

541.93 551.63 B: and without a show like what was that who wants to marry a a millionaire how would you ever get a chance to see such wonderful interactions between people [laughter] 

545.86 546.93 A: yeah 

551.00 558.73 A: yep you know but that's what i mean i mean you take them shows like like that one and and it's and it's always good looking people 

558.90 569.40 A: you know i mean i'm not [laughter] i don't know i don't know how to classify myself but you never just see the you know the the computer geek on there trying to find a wife you know 

559.00 560.37 B: yeah 

568.82 570.09 B: [laughter] oh yeah 

569.33 576.39 A: the day i see bill yates' cousin on there looking for one [laughter] looking for a wife or something now that'd be a reality show 

571.75 574.86 B: [laughter] 

575.95 579.87 B: yeah but that's a- again that's not gonna sell as well 

577.39 578.72 A: (( you know i mean )) 

579.31 591.73 A: yeah that's it i mean everything is is image and i that's another that's that's a lotta reason why i don't like t. v. be- you know is that 'cause they everything has gotta be you know these perfect you know oh 

579.90 581.40 B: (( i don't know )) 

591.73 599.89 A: you know muscles and tanned women and blonde hair and and it's just you know look around you where do you see that
