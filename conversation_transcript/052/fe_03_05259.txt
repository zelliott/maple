148.86 150.61 B: [laughter] 

150.31 155.17 A: but yeah i don't know do you remember a character on that show named zora 

155.90 163.41 B: oh i don't remember exactly but i know yeah i know some part of the story you know 

163.51 168.96 B: (( one gentleman you know twenty twenty ladies yeah )) 

168.47 170.16 A: yep yep 

169.62 170.44 B: (( [mn] )) 

170.47 171.34 B: so 

171.74 177.43 B: (( do you think uh these things are possible or this is real )) 

179.41 180.87 B: it's really happening 

181.76 183.61 A: if it really happened 

184.09 189.59 A: yeah i think it really happened [laughter] i don't i don't think that the uh 

189.61 192.72 A: people they hired were actors or actresses no 

191.84 193.06 B: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

193.29 201.02 A: i i think i think that it really did happen and if it didn't really happen then i'm kinda mad because 

200.03 201.74 B: [laughter] 

201.36 205.96 A: you know it's i really followed that show closely [laughter] 

205.57 217.71 B: but uh you know the people um participate in such a program so what's their motivation why why do they 

217.83 221.44 B: you know join such such a program 

221.53 232.02 A: um i think that they everybody that went on that t. v. show wanted a little bit of fame you know they wanted their fifteen minutes in the spotlight 

228.94 229.75 B: uh-huh 

231.80 232.68 B: uh-huh 

232.48 244.01 A: you know they wanted to be famous you know and and they knew they would be on fox television and you know millions of people watching 

235.72 236.79 B: (( oh okay )) 

240.60 241.51 B: uh-huh 

244.02 248.51 A: and one way and another it would probably help out their careers 

248.22 249.57 B: oh okay 

249.36 256.23 A: so i think uh at least for the women and also with you know joe millionaire as well um 

256.95 263.98 A: [lipsmack] oh his last name was marriott i remember that something marriott and i've forgot his first name but with 

264.42 271.10 A: you know i think that that might've been the main reason for the majority of the people who went on the show 

270.96 272.15 B: (( oh okay )) 

272.05 275.31 A: but for some of the 

275.42 279.24 A: you know competitors i think they might've went on to 

279.42 281.82 A: maybe actually see if they could 

282.06 286.96 A: you know meet meet someone that they could you know marry eventually 

286.28 288.47 B: [laughter] 

287.80 294.27 A: i don't you know i think that's just a very small minority of the people who were on the show 

293.85 294.81 B: uh-huh 

294.66 305.00 A: but i think that there might've been one or two out of the i think there were about twenty ladies on that show who were actually there to 

305.03 310.11 A: try to find you know find something you know maybe they had been dating for a while and 

309.47 310.35 B: uh-huh 

310.36 322.34 A: they figured you know why not you know why not go on the show and see if this person's right and not to mention that you know this person supposedly has is a multi millionaire 

322.57 327.73 B: (( yeah i think if that gentleman is poor i think )) 

323.01 323.86 A: but uh 

327.86 333.78 B: (( um not too many ladies will want to date him )) 

333.27 338.34 A: yeah yeah well first of all i don't think fox would ever make a t. v. show 

338.38 343.41 A: about a poor guy trying to marry [laughter] 

342.89 348.59 B: (( yeah try to marry a millionaire lady [laughter] )) 

343.61 345.14 A: yeah i i 

347.73 352.12 A: yeah that you know i i don't think that would ever work [laughter] so you 

351.45 353.07 B: [laughter] 

352.30 354.79 A: (( know you know yeah if )) 

355.20 358.02 A: if it was just a regular guy 

357.65 358.59 B: uh-huh 

358.85 360.26 A: and 

360.40 363.00 A: you know i don't think that you get the 

363.10 377.75 A: you know th- these girls that came on the show probably you know some of them might've been aspiring actresses or whatever you know but i don't think you'd find that that type of that class of girls if you just had some 

377.39 378.28 B: uh-huh 

377.71 379.84 A: regular regular guy 

379.74 380.68 B: uh-huh 

380.35 386.19 A: well in actuality uh mr marriott was a regular guy but you know 

386.12 389.31 B: but uh he pretends to be uh 

389.32 391.53 B: (( very rich yeah )) 

391.59 398.36 A: ah yep he pretends to be very rich uh he doesn't pull it off too convincingly i must say 

394.36 395.65 B: yeah 

398.06 399.02 B: uh-huh 

398.76 404.99 A: [laughter] i mean he uh yeah not not too convincing and i think that 

405.08 410.30 A: the uh people at fox did a good job of casting 

409.83 410.76 B: uh-huh 

410.86 415.19 A: casting women who they felt would not catch on as quickly 

415.21 416.53 B: yeah 

415.96 417.24 A: so 

417.41 422.86 A: maybe that's why a lotta them but i must say that zora i 

423.24 424.71 A: (( you know i )) 

425.33 432.81 A: i did have a strong feeling that she i i pooled for her from the second show 

428.85 429.73 B: uh-huh 

432.51 433.44 B: uh-huh 

432.87 435.49 A: because after the first show um 

435.59 448.07 A: she had a uh incident where she couldn't find a good dress that fit her or something and i really sympathized for her with her and um i was pooling for her throughout the show 

440.74 441.62 B: uh-huh 

448.69 461.72 A: and in the end she ended up winning and i was about the happiest person [laughter] 'cause i i felt that she was perhaps the only one that i knew was there 

453.96 455.52 B: [laughter] 

461.83 466.23 A: to find someone not you know not for the fame 

465.87 466.99 B: okay 

466.73 472.45 A: she was actually there to try to find someone and it wasn't about the money there that didn't have you 

471.87 473.33 B: [laughter] 

472.70 477.63 A: know that was that was pretty low on her priorities that's that's the feeling i got from her 

477.65 478.73 B: okay 

477.89 491.70 A: and maybe you know what maybe she was just a really good actress and she could play it off like that but i think that she was actually the one really decent girl on that show 

491.43 498.92 B: yeah maybe she has uh sincere intention to be that um that to be the play 

499.06 507.70 A: yeah so i think that she was great [laughter] i if i ever met a woman like that you know she'd be a keeper 

499.55 500.53 B: yeah 

502.95 504.27 B: [laughter] 

508.04 515.64 A: but you know and and the you know geographic wise she's from new jersey which kind of uh 

516.48 518.51 A: it startled me because 

518.42 519.35 B: uh-huh 

518.58 524.11 A: this this woman had was so y- you know i don't not to uh 

524.53 529.20 A: [lipsmack] you know generalize too much about 

528.13 529.04 B: uh-huh 

532.20 533.09 B: (( hello )) 

534.69 535.65 B: hello 

539.21 540.15 B: hello 

544.74 545.54 B: (( what's wrong ))
