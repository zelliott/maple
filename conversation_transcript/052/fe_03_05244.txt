49.67 50.41 A: (( ah )) 

50.62 56.34 B: i mean it's right near the major artery but it's still a small little town everybody knows everybody's business 

54.47 56.17 A: [laughter] 

56.56 62.22 A: yeah see i wouldn't have i couldn't say smoking because i smoke so [laughter] 

59.49 60.38 B: okay 

60.52 71.20 B: most of my friends i don't smoke but most of my friends do but i'd be a hypocrite if i said smoking when i drink a lot so or not a lot but enough [laughter] so yeah i i i'd go with that 

66.78 67.77 A: ah 

70.61 80.06 A: yeah the gossiping drives me crazy he said she said this and that it's like you know just go put it in you know they should start a newspaper i swear [laughter] 

72.54 73.59 B: yeah 

78.25 82.12 B: right and that's usually what it is is gossip unfounded rumors 

81.84 85.16 A: yeah the the story gets bigger and bigger and bigger 

82.75 84.17 B: (( you know it's people )) 

84.76 92.49 B: right it's people paying attention to other people's business when there's really no need to it's like you wanna say get a life [laughter] 

89.27 91.14 A: (( yeah and )) 

91.58 96.06 A: yeah and it's it's funny though because i've noticed that the story always gets bigger and bigger 

95.69 96.95 B: oh sure 

96.50 101.02 A: 'cause i did that as an experiment once i actually started a story 

98.59 99.77 B: [laughter] 

100.72 103.05 B: and it got bigger by the time it got back to you 

102.25 107.08 A: and when it got back to me it wasn't [laughter] making no sense 

105.01 107.78 B: it wasn't even the story you first started telling 

107.32 113.38 A: um it was just something simple you know it was like um i said that this one girl was with this other guy 

114.08 123.46 A: and then it turned out that she left her boyfriend and was pregnant and they were gonna get married and i'm like what you know [laughter] 

122.69 125.09 B: [laughter] i didn't say all that 

124.54 126.72 A: yeah exactly it was funny 

126.16 138.30 B: but that's what people do they embellish to make a story believable i mean you know i mean take i mean that's a good point i mean take uh you know t. v. for instance they've sensationalized a lotta stuff that's really not true 

136.22 137.84 A: yeah they really do 

139.58 143.45 B: huh i i wasn't originally going to pick that but it's it's that's a good one 

143.96 145.13 A: yeah 

145.97 148.79 A: [cough] but how much can you talk on it about it you know 

148.47 149.74 B: right 

149.17 151.07 A: i don't know why they do that 

150.85 158.87 B: well we i guess we all succumb to it a little bit you know just listen to gossip and you know is it true is it not true you know 

155.89 156.79 A: yeah 

158.00 162.47 A: oh yeah yeah and i've even been suckered into spreading the rumor 

162.04 163.01 B: right 

163.12 164.70 A: you know oh 

163.57 168.17 B: well and you can't help it 'cause it's like you're like well that's not the way i heard it [laughter] 

164.81 171.15 A: do you know what i heard about so and so [laughter] yeah it's like part of the excitement or something i don't know 

170.79 176.03 B: yeah i think it's especially a problem in the business uh you know at work 

175.66 177.79 A: yeah yeah definitely 

176.28 179.56 B: it's like you spend so much time with these work people 

179.69 182.94 B: and then it's like you know they're almost like your family 

182.36 187.48 A: yeah i've i've seen that a lot in factories where the people will talk about each other 

187.15 188.41 B: right 

187.81 190.22 A: yeah it's really funny you know 

189.31 190.84 B: yeah it's a shame 

190.62 194.56 A: you get all the news on who's dating who and who went home with who and 

193.74 195.74 B: [laughter] 

195.54 197.13 A: it's really funny 

196.67 198.62 B: (( right )) 

198.04 201.19 A: which ones are the drug users which ones aren't and 

200.65 206.56 B: right and it could've stemmed from something so insignificant that started it 

204.56 205.58 A: yeah 

206.21 216.13 A: yeah that's the funny thing yeah you know someone could be talking about going out for a couple of beers and the next thing you know they've spent three nights together you know [laughter] yeah 

207.17 208.57 B: that's true 

208.72 210.01 B: [laughter] 

215.13 218.63 B: right right it's like where did you get all that information from it's 

218.08 219.54 A: [laughter] 

218.68 221.45 B: not what i said [laughter] 

220.43 222.23 A: yeah it's crazy 

222.68 223.38 B: (( mm )) 

222.75 231.19 A: yeah that's i think the worst is the gossiping because like i said again you know the other stuff mostly harms the per- the person who's doing it 

230.97 232.80 B: right 

231.90 235.43 A: uh and the gossip you can actually harm other people with that 

234.86 238.07 B: oh sure i mean there's some things that you know 

238.34 241.59 B: aren't really that bad but then there's other right 

238.38 239.38 A: yeah 

239.46 248.38 A: well even if it isn't even you know even things that are true or not true if you go around telling it some people believe it other people say they know better you know 

248.22 249.19 B: right 

248.58 256.83 A: but um it still you know eventually trickles down and it and it sometimes harms the person who's the victim of the gossip 

255.61 256.50 B: well 

256.71 260.56 B: some gossip could actually be in your favor ironically enough you know 

258.79 259.97 A: yeah 

260.36 265.86 A: yeah it depends on you know what the what the gossip is again [laughter] yeah 

263.54 267.01 B: right [laughter] it can work in your favor sometimes 

266.78 268.08 A: yes it can 

269.88 271.60 A: i've had that happen too 

271.54 274.55 B: oh sure i have too i mean 

274.63 288.15 B: things that were said about me and i said well you know and i would say just like you're asking why do you think that you know and they're like oh no i mean we didn't really know why just you know i'm like yeah but you know but you know i wouldn't do that 

287.49 288.85 A: (( yep )) 

288.34 294.45 B: it's like they'd rather prefer they'd rather believe what they hear you know rather than question it 

293.87 296.28 A: yep yeah yeah 

295.02 296.93 B: it's just the way we are 

297.08 301.55 A: yeah well if it's someone close to me i'll defend them if i know for sure you know 

300.70 303.40 B: right otherwise you really shouldn't pass judgment 

301.88 306.69 A: but if there's even a shadow of a doubt i'm like oh really you know [laughter] 

305.59 307.28 B: (( right )) 

307.10 309.32 A: it's kinda funny i don't know it's weird 

309.28 311.37 B: it's like you should call them on it you know 

311.14 323.28 A: yeah yeah i actually try nowadays i'll try you know i'm thirty eight years old i'm tired of all all the stupid little games you know [laughter] so i um pretty much try to catch 'em on it 

319.36 320.76 B: mhm 

323.84 325.67 B: that's probably a good way to go 

323.99 324.90 A: (( you know )) 

325.75 334.57 A: you know i'm like did you see this or were you there when this happened and they're like no well i don't really wanna hear it then you know go tell somebody else you know 

331.73 332.66 B: right 

333.18 338.04 B: right oh no no i wasn't there but i heard it from a friend who you know 

337.30 338.77 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

338.20 343.87 B: was with someone who knew you know it's like well then you don't really know [laughter] 

340.73 342.70 A: (( yeah it's like okay )) 

342.83 346.68 A: if you can't give me names i don't wanna know [laughter] you know 

345.25 347.95 B: right [laughter] or a specific 

347.32 350.63 A: i want supporting facts [laughter] 

348.84 349.94 B: (( you know )) 

350.45 358.75 B: and then it's usually a rumor off of a rumor you know oh i heard this is this was always the case blah blah blah [laughter] 

353.18 354.20 A: yep 

354.35 355.31 A: yeah and it's 

358.31 361.52 A: yeah it's it's true it turns into a a 

361.67 364.71 A: frigging big fiasco you know [laughter] 

363.28 365.82 B: yeah it's just unbelievable 

365.22 375.91 A: someone could come out of the bathroom and say i just took a dump and the next thing you know the the story is oh he took a dump in the middle of the main street you know [laughter] 

372.30 380.11 B: right [laughter] i think that's that's one of the drawbacks of being in a small town you're right you know 

378.48 379.68 A: yeah 

380.24 384.59 B: i think it can be the best of the world and it can be the worst of the world i know my 

383.44 385.04 A: oh yeah it can 

384.64 392.08 B: p- my parents grew up in a small town and you know growing up i mean we would visit my grandmother on weekends we were in the town newspaper 

392.15 393.18 B: [laughter] 

392.74 393.69 A: (( ah )) 

393.15 407.23 B: it's like you're getting i mean what and some of it was gossip it was like you know oh such and such came to visit and you know who knows how long they'll say and it's like it wasn't really gossip but you know it was just yeah 

400.31 401.30 A: yeah 

404.82 410.86 A: it was more like an announcement yeah but it was yeah it wasn't gossip because it was telling the truth in what was going on but 

409.00 413.41 B: but to be in a newspaper it's probably gossip created off of it [laughter] 

412.76 416.49 A: yeah oh yeah of course yeah someone reads it in the paper 

413.50 414.49 B: you know 

415.45 420.61 B: i mean that's that's how that's how small this newspaper [laughter] was that they would write about us 

420.03 421.00 A: yeah 

420.63 422.31 B: it's just funny yeah 

421.57 429.11 A: i hear those kids like to break out windows and you know [laughter] i can hear it already are ya kidding me 

426.67 431.25 B: (( [laughter] ))

448.91 453.54 A: yeah i've got a friend who everybody tells me he had sex with a horse when he was younger 

453.11 454.92 B: right 

453.95 462.87 A: now everybody everybody else has heard this from him but you know i'm like a really close friend and he hasn't told me and i'm like no i don't think so you know 

459.92 460.98 B: huh 

463.35 470.71 A: i mean if he was gonna give that kind of a secret up it would be to a close friend you know why would he go tell somebody 

467.69 473.91 B: right why not you'd want them to be most proud of you if you were gonna tell a story like that to anyone to begin with 

473.71 474.60 A: (( yeah it )) 

475.45 478.01 B: well that's a good one i've heard that one before

484.66 488.41 A: so i you know i don't even tell him that they talk about him like that or nothing you know 

487.89 495.29 B: yeah it's not worth it and i'm not gonna say anything to my friend you know that somebody said something because that just precipitates it you know 

495.09 496.30 A: yeah 

495.85 503.24 B: you know and if they call me on it and say well why didn't you tell me about that i'm going to say you know i really didn't put wanna put my stalk in and that's why
