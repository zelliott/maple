5.99 7.89 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] good to meet you 

8.19 11.71 B: and today's subject is bioterrorism 

10.51 14.22 A: right and what can the united states do to prevent it [laughter] 

13.74 15.07 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

16.30 19.25 B: (( well )) 

18.40 21.49 A: [laughter] i really you know i mean 

20.49 21.96 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

23.37 25.31 A: to me it it's 

25.42 30.48 A: like an assassin i mean if somebody really wants to get somebody 

30.57 36.71 A: ah there's a way they're gonna get there you cannot prevent every single possibility 

37.23 38.18 A: (( ah )) 

37.62 38.45 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

38.90 45.39 A: i think the best way to prevent bioterrorism is to improve our foreign relations [laughter] 

46.44 49.11 A: and to start being a little more 

49.23 52.93 A: sympathetic to all countries that're out there 

53.39 58.24 A: and their ideas rather than believe everybody has to be as we are 

55.10 55.78 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

60.34 74.86 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah that that that's part of the problem is that everyone does not think like we do [laughter] and and with the [noise] chemical weapons they're really pretty easy to 

66.51 67.52 A: right 

75.32 78.79 B: (( um manufacture today [noise] [noise] )) 

77.97 84.88 A: oh absolutely i mean and they don't have to bring 'em into the country they can get what they need right here ah 

84.23 86.98 B: right the oklahoma city bombing 

86.64 87.68 A: right 

87.01 90.30 B: with the the guy used a fertilizer 

89.95 91.04 A: mhm 

90.38 92.59 B: basically ten ten ten 

92.54 93.46 A: right 

92.70 102.22 B: an- and packed his truck full [laughter] and let it go and that's pretty you know that's s- it's pretty hard to to it's a tough deal when you can't buy fertilizer any more [noise] [noise] 

101.13 104.01 A: right i know i ah i 

105.18 108.18 A: think through laws and and restriction 

108.99 112.68 A: would help you know i mean because they do make things harder 

112.74 113.80 A: but 

114.13 117.24 A: i don't see how you could completely stop it 

115.07 116.43 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

117.46 118.34 A: (( ah )) 

119.01 123.25 A: i think you have to have some laws and that but there again i'm 

123.46 125.33 A: concerned because 

126.26 133.83 A: i don't wanna give up my individual freedoms [laughter] for the perception of security either [laughter] 

134.55 138.87 B: yeah you want more than just a perception there [laughter] before you're you know before you're willing to give 

137.58 146.15 A: right well it's been said and i don't know who said it but the only real se- the only real security is in freedom [laughter] 

146.61 150.73 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] well well that that's a good saying i'm not sure who said that either 

150.36 152.51 A: [laughter] so you know i mean 

153.36 158.42 A: i can't see giving them up because then i think i have even less security [laughter] 

159.83 160.79 A: (( so ah )) 

159.90 163.68 B: yeah yes i that's like they'll disarm america 

163.72 164.97 A: right 

164.37 165.48 B: (( but i would think )) 

166.00 167.57 B: they are doing w- 

167.79 171.89 B: somewhat with ah ah the homeland security 

171.29 172.54 A: mhm 

171.98 173.81 B: and trying to 

174.61 175.87 B: (( [noise] um )) 

177.59 185.98 B: [noise] follow down you know the groups [noise] who may be trying to do this sort of thing 

186.11 187.90 A: right 

187.88 188.45 B: (( [noise] )) 

188.73 191.74 A: and and one of the problems is is ah 

192.68 196.46 A: you know i- if you're talking about domestic terrorism then that's ah 

196.88 202.72 A: morality itself which is on the decline to a great degree 

201.13 202.79 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

202.85 205.28 B: yes it's hard to ah [noise] 

203.07 204.10 A: i mean 

204.69 206.60 A: i i have a ah 

207.68 211.87 A: twenty year old son so i s- talk with a lot of his friends and that 

211.89 214.18 A: who come by to visit and ah 

212.96 214.26 B: (( [noise] )) 

214.90 219.21 A: it's amazing that a majority of young people i meet 

219.29 221.79 A: don't believe in any higher power 

223.40 226.44 A: they strictly believe it's them [laughter] 

227.49 230.89 A: and that's that in itself is dangerous [laughter] 

230.50 235.25 B: [noise] [noise] yes yes and ah what [mn] [lipsmack] 

235.48 236.71 B: i guess what 

237.42 242.41 A: 'cause the basis for their morality becomes whatever they want whatever they think [laughter] 

243.53 253.23 B: yeah and if they're basically comes down to what you believe in i- in anymore how like you're saying your moralities but um there're so many different religions out there 

246.65 247.59 A: right 

252.69 253.74 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

253.40 256.47 B: [noise] and i- it's like that is the what's that's the number one cause 

256.56 260.61 B: of death h- is is l- t- peoples different religions 

260.41 261.55 A: yeah 

261.02 263.73 B: have started more wars [laughter] than anything else 

263.18 267.80 A: well religion in itself has has always been destructive 

267.42 269.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

268.34 271.30 A: [laughter] unfortunately i mean i'm a christian 

271.34 272.42 B: yes 

271.73 284.50 A: but i do not believe in organized religion [laughter] because every organized religion i've looked at has their own thoughts their own ways their own do's and don'ts 

284.82 290.74 A: so they each have their own morality [laughter] unfortunately and ah 

292.19 295.73 A: you know everybody has to be just like them or they're 

295.80 296.89 A: wrong 

296.31 299.04 B: yeah yeah 

297.84 298.93 A: (( and ah )) 

299.37 303.62 A: in a way that's carried over into our foreign policy [laughter] 

305.17 306.68 B: yes 

305.75 306.61 A: so 

306.65 309.59 A: i mean it it's bioterrorism is 

310.00 320.73 A: i don't know it's it's a very difficult thing because like you were saying earlier it it is so easy ingredients are so available i mean there're so many things 

320.95 324.03 A: in your every day life that can be combined [laughter] 

324.78 326.67 A: for a disaster 

327.86 328.88 A: so 

329.24 335.89 A: i think y- all we can do is is the best we can through laws and vigilance and everything else 

336.41 338.07 A: and through 

338.74 344.92 A: changing our our policies to be a little more accepting and understanding of 

344.98 349.44 A: of other people and maybe not try to interfere as much 

350.41 351.56 A: [laughter] and you know 

352.00 352.89 A: ah 

353.26 357.16 A: let things take their own course in in these foreign countries 

360.82 365.04 B: [mn] yeah 'cause ah well we're we're fixing to find out 

364.63 374.95 A: and yeah [laughter] yeah i mean the way i see it ah we're gonna have a few more battles in the middle east before we're finished ah the way the president's talking [laughter] 

365.30 366.84 B: [laughter] 

375.86 376.86 A: so 

377.51 384.99 A: and you can't tell me that a lot of the unrest we're seeing in different countries isn't formatted by our c._i._a. [laughter] 

385.75 388.47 A: and our operatives in there agitating 

388.62 396.96 A: i mean we've done that around the world and it you know ten twenty years later it comes out oh well we did this we did that and [laughter] 

397.41 399.81 B: (( yeah )) 

397.42 401.30 A: and we don't always we don't always back the right side [laughter] 

403.74 405.52 A: i d- i don't know i mean 

405.94 407.10 A: this ah 

407.51 414.22 A: oh god i forget his name it just slipped my mind the guy in iraq that the united states is ah 

415.59 424.40 A: backing ah he's a darling of the pentagon and the c._i._a. well the iranian people don't want him he hasn't been there since he was a baby 

425.05 433.02 A: plus he was driven out of lebanon for ah bank fraud so he's a fugitive from the state of lebanon 

433.19 440.11 A: they're still after him [laughter] and ah and we're pushing him to be the newest leader of iraq [laughter] 

441.71 446.24 A: you know and their people don't want him so i i don't know you know 

441.73 442.79 B: (( hm [mn] )) 

446.72 449.48 A: ah [sigh] i think a lot of the things we do 

449.62 455.10 A: lead to terrorism we we format it we don't stop it 

455.76 458.51 A: whether it's bio or anything else 

460.07 460.94 A: ah 

461.28 463.98 A: terror- terrorism is a difficult thing 

464.87 466.61 A: yeah 

466.78 471.59 A: you know and and what is terrorism i mean it's getting now to where 

471.60 478.31 A: people talking if if if in their talk they make some kind of a threat they're saying well it was a terroristic act [laughter] 

479.15 486.64 A: so [laughter] i i mean you know you look at some of these cases who people m- have been arrested and 

486.80 494.21 A: they're lumping it all under terrorism now because that's the key buzz word that excites people and says yeah yeah yeah [laughter] 

493.66 497.99 B: yes you [laughter] if you if you r- if you use that word then you can 

496.86 497.77 A: yeah 

498.56 499.57 A: so 

498.75 499.71 B: you 

501.03 505.18 A: well i'm doing all the talking [laughter] i haven't let you talk so [laughter] 

504.45 512.42 B: [laughter] uh-huh yeah well bioterrorism there's a there's a few you know different points you can look at but obviously 

512.93 517.42 B: it would be um well like we've kind of both agreed that 

518.92 520.83 B: s- s- there there're enough 

520.98 523.35 B: every day chemicals available 

523.78 526.04 B: that um 

527.23 531.06 B: y- that part of it can not really be controlled 

529.89 537.57 A: right i mean you you can track them you can track 'em to try to make sure there aren't any large purchases but 

531.58 533.72 B: and then as you were saying i was 

538.18 542.66 A: from the things that're being said it doesn't take large amounts [laughter] 

542.39 543.62 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

546.71 558.90 B: then it's also s- who who would do ah who would use a a biochemical weapon or a or a bioterrorism and that would be that would be a very desperate group of people 

553.12 554.05 A: right 

559.03 560.04 A: (( right mhm )) 

559.08 563.51 B: who were kind of like thinking that would be like their if their their 

563.78 567.86 B: you would hope that they would feel that would be like their only option 

568.58 572.02 A: yeah but i mean what what is a desperate person 

572.56 575.51 A: i mean when you come right down to it 

576.17 578.23 A: the most massive 

578.62 580.50 A: weapon of destruction 

581.00 584.52 A: have only been dropped by a president of the united states 

585.89 592.63 A: who with his military leaders purposefully targeted civilian populations to get maximum carnage 

592.51 593.71 B: [mn] 

593.33 594.79 A: and that was truman 

594.47 597.17 B: [laughter] yeah that was a pay back 

596.66 599.04 A: [laughter] well i mean but still 

598.58 599.89 B: yeah [laughter] but still
