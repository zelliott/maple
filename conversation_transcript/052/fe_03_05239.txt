174.17 174.91 A: (( how )) 

175.20 178.93 A: a person eats isn't really nothing to be ashamed of 

179.69 183.69 B: right i mean you shouldn't overeat 

183.72 186.55 B: and you should exercise but 

188.39 189.91 B: i don't really 

189.95 195.85 B: you know as far as i'm concerned i i try not to do those things or do them as 

195.98 197.37 B: you're supposed to 

197.63 199.58 A: mhm 

198.46 201.63 B: but i don't force it upon anyone else 

205.90 208.26 B: live and let live as i 

208.69 210.05 B: as i say 

208.70 212.03 A: yeah good motto 

212.06 213.18 B: yes 

213.75 215.02 B: exactly 

217.43 220.05 B: so are you a first time caller or

229.61 234.02 B: so but the noise level will go up 

234.88 238.40 B: and i'm trying to cook supper too here at the same time 

238.62 240.26 A: [laughter] 

240.38 241.60 B: but ah 

242.18 243.38 B: yeah so 

243.76 246.03 B: what do you do out there in san francisco 

246.22 251.34 A: um i'm a part time worker and full time student 

250.72 252.72 B: you're a student 

251.90 252.83 A: yes 

253.00 255.46 B: and ah what are we learning to be 

255.61 258.49 A: um computer science and technology 

258.56 261.50 B: which is the field to get into in these times 

261.32 263.61 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

263.93 265.73 A: yeah it's 

266.25 269.69 A: it's something that i've always kind of 

270.22 274.97 A: fell into since i was little i've always liked either building stuff or 

275.18 279.32 A: taking things apart and rebuilding them and computers 

279.04 280.50 B: right 

283.52 287.94 A: so that's kind of kind of the field that i felt that i would probably 

288.40 291.16 A: progress in as i got older 

291.34 293.91 B: right so how old are you 

294.33 296.03 A: um nineteen 

296.02 298.16 B: nineteen another young whippersnapper 

299.07 304.10 B: the last guy i had was eighteen and you're nineteen i'm forty years old 

304.03 305.31 A: [laughter] 

307.10 313.13 B: so all i guess it's ah the young whippersnappers that are looking for the easy cash [laughter] 

312.75 316.28 A: actually my girlfriend ah suggested 

315.19 316.74 B: hooked you on to this 

316.43 317.56 A: yeah 

317.52 320.12 B: yeah my wife hooked me on to it to so 

320.36 321.77 B: you're not alone 

321.89 323.34 A: [laughter] 

323.29 326.86 B: but you know it is kind of easy money so 

326.41 328.21 A: yeah true 

328.09 333.94 B: so i put up with it but anyway we digress from ah personal habits 

334.05 334.73 A: (( mm )) 

336.02 336.77 A: (( [sigh] )) 

337.32 344.36 B: so i mean like i said my feelings are as long as you're not bothering me with it 

345.41 349.60 B: i think you should let people do whatever they want to do 

350.75 354.55 A: yeah 'cause pretty much you can't change a person's 

355.86 356.90 A: habits 

356.01 364.69 B: right like i said i mean ev- nobody should be smoking everybody knows i._t. but they're still out there 

364.40 366.21 A: yeah 

365.36 372.88 B: and they'll they'll fight over it i mean we just had a big you know a big town vote in our town 

373.21 376.12 B: you know whether to make it non smoking or not 

376.21 377.09 A: (( mm )) 

377.50 380.28 A: yeah we actually passed a um 

380.63 381.97 A: a bill 

382.23 392.23 A: i believe it was last year or the year before last which kind of restricted smoking in um resid- residential areas and business areas 

392.56 393.60 A: um 

393.63 403.10 A: we're not allowed to smoke in bus stops or and all the non and all the smoking sections in restaurants have been kind of ah terminated so now 

403.13 414.46 A: by law you have to smoke ah at least a hundred and fifty feet away from a bus stop or yeah or outside of a a public restaurant 

408.68 409.66 B: really 

413.94 417.37 B: you have to smoke outside they wont let you smoke inside anymore 

416.84 418.75 A: no more inside smoking 

418.89 422.32 B: that's basically what we passed here 

422.36 428.65 B: i mean not outside it's just inside and it has to do with how man- you know 

428.96 432.77 B: if if someone's employed somewhere 

432.63 434.60 A: mhm 

433.59 435.40 B: they ban the smoking 

436.02 440.56 B: so that i mean that that counts all your restaurants 

440.80 443.33 B: (( all your bars so ah )) 

443.75 452.06 B: the people were quite up in arms that the bus- the bar owners and the business owners 

451.28 453.15 A: mhm 

452.81 459.69 B: so i can kind of see their side of it you know who am i to tell you what you can do in your business 

459.88 460.77 A: (( sure )) 

460.67 461.75 B: but 

463.32 464.95 B: it passed anyway 

465.28 467.56 B: so it's a moot point 

467.71 473.30 A: yeah if you it's kind of hard to believe that there's a lot of non smokers 

474.30 480.53 A: than there is smokers but somehow the bills passed 'cause i'm out here in san francisco 

480.34 481.49 B: (( yeah )) 

480.90 486.35 A: and you think that the ah ratio would be more smokers than non smokers 

486.41 490.61 A: the way everybody the way you always walk down the street and see everyone smoking 

489.70 492.65 B: yeah you walk down the street and everybody's smoking 

492.76 495.70 B: i guess because they're all booted outside 

495.35 500.67 A: [laughter] probably that's a possibility 

500.11 508.64 B: that could be it well like i said hopefully ah smoking will become a thing of the past but too you know there's too much money in it 

509.35 516.42 B: with all these companies and too much money in you know the government makes huge money off the smoking 

516.61 517.41 A: yeah 

517.43 521.13 B: so i think it's going to be around for a while anyway 

522.58 525.77 A: yeah and i guess 

526.76 533.75 A: eventually some of the people will start realizing as they start losing relat- relatives and friends 

534.07 536.37 B: oh and just the cost of it too 

534.59 535.87 A: yeah 

537.17 541.95 A: i know prices here actually went up a dollar fifty 

543.09 544.36 A: so i mean 

544.99 547.08 B: a pack you mean 

545.08 546.11 A: cigarettes 

546.35 557.66 A: yeah cigarettes used to actually be like two seventy five three dollars a pack now some some cigarettes are like five dollars and fifty cents five seventy five 

557.95 559.92 B: oh it is it's an 

559.93 561.58 B: expensive habit 

561.42 563.49 A: yeah very expensive 

563.92 564.72 A: (( [sigh] )) 

564.60 566.19 B: and a bad one too 

568.10 570.08 A: yeah 

571.07 573.39 A: (( so how about the long term um )) 

575.04 578.35 A: long term medical issues you can get from smoking 

578.29 582.04 B: right and that costs everybody money 

582.37 583.45 A: yeah 

582.79 585.76 B: 'cause now my insurance is going to go up because 

586.46 589.15 B: you know these smokers have cancer and 

589.74 591.22 B: trust me cancer 

591.31 593.96 B: (( treatments are very expensive )) 

595.41 597.16 B: (( very expensive )) 

597.77 599.89 A: i bel- i believe so
