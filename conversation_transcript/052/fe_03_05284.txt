244.71 254.41 B: [laughter] that's about the only thing i can think of 'cause i'd uh me i would think of something for the family type thing trying to get the family more involved and the kids' day suits me more 

250.34 251.24 A: yeah 

251.86 255.25 A: yeah you you you you sound like a family person

418.78 419.62 A: (( yeah )) 

419.17 432.31 B: i mean i have and then it makes me upset with them i try to watch it but i i get a gift for this person i get a gift for this other person i got each one of them a gift they're not concerned that i got one and one for them it's the fact of the value of the gift 

427.96 428.97 A: (( mhm right )) 

431.58 433.36 A: exactly that's right 

432.70 434.54 B: they're upset about 

433.93 445.67 A: yeah and you know that that's the problem you know sometimes you you you want to get a gift but then you are thinking about how the other person might feel about that gift and and it puts you in 

439.71 440.58 B: mhm 

445.51 451.02 A: in in limbo it puts you in in doubt as to you know well what am i going to get will they like this 

451.03 456.95 A: you know not realizing that it's more the thought [laughter] you know 

451.20 452.04 B: yeah 

455.03 457.94 B: (( yeah it start i'll tell you about my )) 

457.85 465.73 B: my my um uh feelings about going shopping for christmas presents when i go shopping for christmas presents it's not that easy to me 'cause you know you got fifty fifty and go through like twenty things 

465.58 473.37 B: what should i get then finally when you get the gift they don't realize how hard it was to get this thing it ain't just the money it was also the thought and thinking with the gift 

470.17 471.77 A: that's right that's 

472.41 484.44 A: right you you are so right you spend a lot of time wondering you know about that gift and how how is the person going to react to that gift you know you really do you spend a lot of time thinking about that that 

480.73 481.61 B: yeah 

483.85 497.21 B: yeah i know i've done that before and then when i hand the gift to the person they they they all look at 'em it's like [sigh] is that all you i mean mind i didn't say nothing to them but like i said gave two people gifts and the other person's throwing down the other one's happier like 

493.95 495.29 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

497.18 502.68 B: they don't even she this this person doesn't even realize how hard i went to get that gift for them 

501.69 503.62 A: exactly you know 

503.56 505.64 B: (( i mean and all they can do is complain )) 

503.89 504.92 A: and that's 

505.38 517.23 A: that's right you know gift buying can be that's a that's a time consume consuming occ- oh i won't call it occupation but that's a time consuming uh job you know that's oh man you know you spend like i said you spend a lot of time you know 

517.34 518.47 B: yeah 

517.74 523.66 A: you take a lot of time uh out of out of your time you know to to do that thinking about someone else 

523.59 524.56 B: mhm 

523.79 527.81 A: and that was really what you're doing you know you're giving them that that time 

527.31 528.72 B: mhm 

528.11 534.19 A: because all the thoughts are on them and how they're going to accept that gift and how they're going to perceive the gift when you give it to 'em 

533.91 535.45 B: yeah exactly 

534.84 537.01 A: yeah that's right 

536.82 539.90 B: yeah but that's not me 

538.35 539.61 A: are you a veteran 

540.80 549.94 B: that's not how i think when if i get a gift to from a person right away it's just it's just like it already breaks my heart it's like oh they thought of me at least they thought 

541.82 542.81 A: (( yes )) 

548.67 551.03 A: that's right that's right 

550.74 552.17 B: (( of me [laughter] )) 

551.56 561.47 A: when the time i get it oh i thank you for this this oh you know i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm really i'm overjoyed but it it doesn't take much to make me happy anyway [laughter] 

557.68 558.71 B: yeah 

560.69 563.20 B: (( it doesn't take much to make me happy either well )) 

561.48 565.25 A: i'm a very simple person [laughter] 

563.56 575.40 B: yeah well all all that makes me happy is if i had a wife which i don't right now but if i had a wife all she has to do really is show me simple make me some happy hugs and kisses that's all i really need to show that she definitely loves me 

573.24 574.40 A: (( oh okay )) 

575.26 576.36 A: okay 

575.56 577.31 B: that's what makes me happy she
