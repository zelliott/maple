59.41 73.49 A: so basically ah i i'm using more cautious and like using stupid thing except [laughter] ah ah my physician i called the other day voodoo doctor he gave me some kind of ah herbal medicine 

73.48 85.10 A: which makes this thing [mn] ah a bit more easier so when you've if not not feeling well [mn] it's about ten drops on the tongue and you're all set

107.80 110.14 B: right right that makes sense 

110.77 112.06 B: that makes sense 

114.29 115.20 B: well just 

115.00 117.96 A: you going you doing more exercises or 

117.00 121.41 B: yeah just just ah i do a lot of running actually especially in the winter

131.68 133.26 A: mm yeah well 

132.15 139.31 B: i suppose i suppose many people ah feel that way during the winter they're everything's slowed down and ah 

140.77 151.33 A: well i wouldn't say so it's just a matter of ah like you get sick if ah the temperature jumping back and forth and that's like that's what it is 

140.86 142.19 B: just just 

151.37 163.65 A: because if it stays cold [noise] okay it's usually you get sick when it's going up or down and it's it's again i don't know personally i don't like running 

163.60 166.58 A: i prefer do do to do something else 

167.14 171.21 A: but ah that's about it 

170.43 175.92 B: yeah but it's [laughter] it's it's it's not just sick in terms of getting a cold or catching you 

176.06 176.95 B: know 

176.39 182.22 A: yeah it's it's just sometimes you want to sit on the couch watch t._v. right 

181.66 182.66 B: right 

182.83 183.53 A: (( ah )) 

182.98 189.44 B: right and and and it it also has to do with you know mood changes also and and how you feel all around 

188.94 199.81 A: ah it's it's it's again ah i know but i i i get used to live with it because like yeah days become shorter and ah 

200.04 213.03 A: you feel it and it's [laughter] and when they we we change the clock boom instantly you get the switch that's the most difficult ah part of of of the fall because it's boom you get ah 

212.95 218.73 A: you leave your home when it's dark and returning home w- it's already dark 

218.17 222.09 B: right and and that's that's part of it that's part of the problem there 

221.92 224.81 A: ah i wouldn't say it's it's like that's what 

224.67 237.39 A: (( on your mood but it's yeah maybe that's that's the part but there is not much you can do with it just ah have to live with it that's just overcome [laughter] would not ah make later )) 

237.69 239.22 A: right 

238.66 239.72 B: say that again 

239.44 247.80 A: (( would not ah make later when the day a is ah like it it it spreads ah even distributed during the year )) 

247.65 250.66 B: yeah i guess that's right i guess you're right there 

250.86 253.49 B: that's certainly one way of looking at it i mean 

253.98 258.71 B: it is equally distributed i can't complain now that ah i'm close to the summer 

257.20 265.11 A: yeah no that's no that's fine that's it's it's it's it's again but it's still it's not bad because like yeah if it's 

265.25 273.73 A: the the worst ah the worst thing in the winter when it's really cold that's what i don't like that's what about the weather 

274.88 280.28 B: yeah the cold i mean like i said it depends on what type of illness you you once caught it 

279.23 293.95 A: ah it's not the illness it's just cold it's it's again the [laughter] [laughter] [mn] most often you get sick when the temperature ah usually goes from very cold to cold or ah f- to warmer then when you [mn] 

283.82 285.03 B: [laughter] 

293.72 299.57 A: then you get sick but when it stays cold all the time that's that's that's that's 

299.74 301.44 A: (( it's terrible )) 

301.87 313.84 A: it's terrible because i don't know it's it's it's it's like i just don't like once i feel ah the cold it was about forty some minus forty something [mn] 

314.90 319.06 A: and i wish i never feel ah feel like that

374.24 377.38 A: (( a cold it it's in a mild shape ah )) 

377.32 391.32 A: it usually it's it's somewhere in the middle of fall when it's really become cold and usually once once ah right after new year and it's like each year and it [mn] it's 

391.27 393.01 A: going each year

398.32 402.78 B: and and just to you know do a regular check up 

400.60 411.98 A: no it it's like yeah most likely you call your doctor and they go an talk oh did you try tolen- ta- tylenol or tylenol flu and it's something serious ah then it's 

411.95 417.45 A: but in my case sometimes it may be be serious um but that's that's ah that's 

417.52 425.07 A: sometimes it's usually once in the five years it ah this weird time i get sick pretty serious 

425.12 425.91 B: (( ha )) 

425.15 428.25 A: it's like accumulating your sick i don't know 

427.81 430.22 B: (( hm ))

438.95 439.74 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

440.36 443.57 A: (( and it's it's again it's pretty you know it's )) 

443.75 447.69 A: [laughter] i want to yeah it's sometimes pretty 

444.87 445.88 B: (( and )) 

447.81 453.13 A: [mn] the weather might be pretty lousy because it's wet and cold and moist 

452.23 462.47 B: and you're also you're also exposed to all kinds of bacteria such as the subway when you're touching the rails if you don't careful to wash our hands at all times you know 

458.32 459.87 A: yeah but i'm 

462.33 472.90 A: [mn] but i'm not using subway but still you cannot like ah in- insulate yourself [noise] because what's happened is in the grocery store 

462.77 464.47 B: easy to pick up germs 

472.77 477.34 A: or in the public places where you're going you're exposed to bacteria 

477.37 478.94 B: (( oh yeah [mn] )) 

477.54 489.42 A: it may be bank it may be a a a supermarket it may be but it's it's it's again i'm not using subway for example and i'm not using buses but still 

489.69 502.11 A: there is people around like you can go for lunch for burger king and ah that's you get bacteria or [laughter] in other places and like it's another [mn] 

503.04 509.19 A: (( that's where you and you can't [mn] you're not living in the bubble right )) 

508.58 509.94 B: you're not using the what 

509.82 512.02 A: you're not living in the bubble 

511.63 513.20 B: no you're not but 

512.38 513.41 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

513.26 519.62 B: just just in terms of personal hygiene i think the higher your standards are the less likely you are to get sick 

519.12 532.07 A: yeah but it's it's it's again the whole thing is with washing hand and it's it's i don't know ah again yeah i i do but i don't believe that washing hands alone can help you 

531.75 533.21 B: (( mm )) 

532.53 540.94 A: it's you cannot wash yourself because it's like it ah it may get into through the your mouth through your mouth it's it's in the air 

540.87 544.41 B: mm that's that's interesting yes 

544.36 547.10 A: it's in the air it's not only our 

547.59 552.41 A: hands and it's again this is my personal like i'm not health care professional 

552.24 553.11 B: right 

552.89 562.72 A: but it's my [laughter] general wisdom tells me hey that can't be done this way because it's it's there there's bacteria and it's it's again 

562.96 570.08 A: usually i i'm in the high risk in the high risk group because what's happened is my wife she works with the kids 

571.04 573.08 A: and when the fall starts 

572.85 580.16 A: they're sick all the time and she brings all this ah stuff in home at home so it's it's it's 

580.05 593.23 A: like ah bec- [laughter] you can not stay away um but the [laughter] the the three years kids with ah whom my wife works it's like basically [laughter] it's like a smoking gun right 

592.64 594.34 B: right right 

594.32 599.89 A: so it's it's it's funny she'll become sick pretty often but not me
