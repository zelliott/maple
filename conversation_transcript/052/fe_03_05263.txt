112.39 115.38 B: um i'm a great fan of ah 

115.22 122.23 B: british news and french news radio and ah newspapers and comparing them and contrasting them in the search for truth 

122.16 123.35 B: [mn] and ah ah 

123.34 132.78 B: i don't know if you followed the ah private lynch story but ah that seems to be an a a case of reality t._v. ah 

126.84 128.28 A: (( yes ahah )) 

132.77 139.27 B: purely invented there's two versions of the story one is the made for television version and then there's the truth 

139.23 149.64 A: [mn] right i i thought about that from the start i know she's pretty and a young woman so it's great press [mn] but there's other people out there too you know went through an awful lot [mn] 

149.98 151.76 B: (( yeah )) 

151.66 154.80 A: i'm sure they invented ninety percent of it for tv [mn] 

154.77 164.86 B: yeah i mean that's and the funny part is they're going to actually as i understand it make a t._v. made for t._v. version which will be even more over the top [mn] 

163.98 168.80 A: [mn] oh wow [laughter] do you follow those other shows they have 

168.84 172.60 A: [cough] excuse me like survivor or no

201.20 211.29 A: ah i i can't figure it out for the life of me my family doesn't like it my mother in law loves it but nobody else does i mean they're getting everybody they got this girl lewinsky that was 

211.24 224.94 A: president ah clinton's you know girlfriend yeah and she has no experience no nothing she's worthless except for you know what she does and ah she got a big show big contract big money big money

235.59 237.85 B: yeah i have i know that one 

237.19 241.44 A: yeah she really blew up and she got a fantasy show too so 

241.66 247.33 A: [lipsmack] they must have an audience for it [mn] i think it's just a passing fad though myself 

242.08 243.06 B: [mn] 

247.38 255.38 A: and it's going to blow up in a few minutes they're over saturating the market all of a sudden nobody's gonna watch any more they're gonna get rid of all of 'em 

254.97 268.96 B: i remember about seven years ago when this was all starting out ah maybe about the same ah era as cops or maybe even before that [mn] um i was flipping through the channels on the t._v. with a room of ah 

268.73 270.01 B: people i didn't 

270.06 273.44 B: know watching and there was this show [mn] 

273.71 278.63 B: where they had live footage of ah people doing extreme sports 

278.74 284.67 B: and they were doing sorta para-gliding on the edge of a hill and it's like i don't know 

281.96 282.83 A: (( ahah )) 

285.08 296.27 B: -chuting you actually just sort of hang right over the top of the hill by the wind and the wind turned the wrong way or something and this guy fell more or less straight down ah six twelve 

296.33 302.77 B: feet onto it wasn't really a hard surface but you know he probably broke something [mn] and you know this sort of 

302.96 312.87 B: random brutality [mn] and i just kept going but everyone had to go back and see it and i [mn] i just didn't understand what was the joy of it 

313.52 314.24 A: mm 

315.40 320.07 A: yeah they really get carried away now though they they have to invent a script for these things 

320.04 332.77 A: and people will kill themselves to get on a show [laughter] and the ratings are quite high in illinois anyway in the u._s. it's a big deal over here they have articles in the paper and everything so 

327.11 328.79 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

332.53 344.36 B: oh i um went on ah abroad ah it sort of depends on the moment but ah the latest wave ah it it filters into the media on this side of the ah 

344.31 348.39 B: ah it ah it truly does ah make waves 

348.57 349.33 A: (( ha )) 

350.67 353.58 A: are the shows popular in ah paris also 

353.78 355.68 B: well they have um 

356.74 368.64 B: they have their own versions of reality t._v. um they like putting ah groups of young people in lofts and locking them in there for six months and sees see what happens 

368.97 369.76 A: oh 

368.97 370.69 B: that seems to be their ah 

370.57 371.94 A: oh okay 

370.96 372.81 B: favorite genre 

372.96 380.60 B: but um the they really don't they pick up some american television but they picked up very very little on 

380.48 383.93 B: reality t._v. with the exception of cops 

383.79 385.00 B: and that's 

384.91 393.43 B: hilarious for the french because you get these video feeds of ah and of course it's all translated into french but you get these video feeds of a 

393.44 405.24 B: a person driving ah seventy miles an hour through a sort of residential area and the the cops screaming like guys doing seventy doing eighty and the french and it's translated and 

405.15 408.76 B: the are looking at each other and saying well so what [mn] 

408.51 412.69 A: [laughter] they drive that way out there 

412.72 413.81 B: exactly 

414.81 418.47 A: [laughter] oh ah can i ask you a question off the subject a little bit 

418.67 419.86 B: (( sure [mn] )) 

418.71 424.80 A: how do they feel about the americans with all the stuff going on with you know the middle east 

423.71 424.47 B: (( you )) 

424.89 427.81 B: know ah france and america have an 

427.83 439.55 B: [lipsmack] an incredibly long history and despite the fact that ah there've been many moments when ah that capital has been burnt a little this time it's different ah 

429.91 430.82 A: yes 

439.78 450.44 B: ah america has burnt up ah almost all of its good capital with france this time [mn] um this ah 

447.30 448.19 A: oh 

450.86 464.00 B: this confirms ah for many peo- this confirmed not only for the french who didn't like america and there always w- was a sliver but this confirmed for centrists and even people who liked america that ah 

465.30 467.04 B: [mn] the world is a different world 

467.34 468.39 B: ah 

468.57 475.33 B: america to reestablish the relationship that existed before has a hell of a lot of work to 

475.55 476.45 A: mm 

476.49 489.78 A: i see [mn] yeah we get a one sided version over here you know it's all the french fault and ah [mn] there's a lot of americans don't understand it either i still don't i'm not vocal about it or in protesting but 

486.61 487.75 B: (( do )) 

489.78 494.32 A: i didn't understand the need for war that's the last thing anybody wants 

494.76 497.08 B: (( yeah )) 

495.05 496.37 A: yeah but 

497.08 499.05 A: i think it should have been through the united na- [cough] 

499.22 501.76 A: united nations but 

500.07 500.86 B: (( [mn] we- )) 

501.73 511.51 B: [mn] the problem was that ah it should have went to the united nations and the bush seemed to do the right thing but ah 

511.36 523.36 B: we all discovered ah that um it was all for show and when he didn't get the answer that tony blair promised him he would get ah he basically said screw it [mn] um [lipsmack] it 

520.97 522.05 A: right 

523.65 525.29 B: managed to debase 

525.89 534.24 B: the institution ah and that is something that ah huge slices of the world are not going to forgive ah 

534.29 536.32 B: (( bush for but ah )) 

536.58 547.78 B: to put it differently a lot's gonna depend on the next election um europe and the world will be willing to dismiss this all as george bush if he is not reelected 

547.48 548.30 A: (( ahah )) 

547.90 557.65 B: but if he is reelected and strongly reelected it's going to be awfully hard to ah just write this off as the madness of one man 

558.56 569.77 A: yeah it seems ah you know a shame 'cause france and u._s. were always allies th- they helped us during the revolutionary war you know [mn] they were a big factor in the americans getting their freedom 

559.41 559.97 B: (( [mn] )) 

566.91 568.53 B: (( yeah )) 

568.72 570.17 B: (( i think )) 

569.93 574.63 A: that's not brought up lately it's all the you know one sided stuff but ah 

574.22 576.59 B: [mn] well you know th- 

574.85 575.83 A: (( ah but )) 

576.82 579.66 B: (( sorry go ahead [mn] )) 

577.90 588.85 A: ah there's no real answer to what they did over there there's no definite proof or definite reason to go jumping in like they did ah it reminded me so much of vietnam 

587.62 590.75 B: (( yeah )) 

588.92 599.89 A: you know just basically the same type of thing a certain group of people got together and decided to do this and no matter what happened they went ahead and did it and it's still gonna be 

593.13 593.69 B: (( [mn] ))
