218.01 219.53 A: (( except it's inside you )) 

220.29 222.76 A: (( don't have to worry about getting rained out )) 

230.63 233.13 A: yeah i've been working there about six months yeah hm 

233.35 235.11 B: mhm 

236.70 239.20 B: so which ones do you think are the worst 

244.13 246.32 A: i kinda agree with you i think goss- 

246.34 247.56 A: (( gossiping really )) 

247.97 251.48 B: it is isn't it 'cause it'll hurt you in the workplace it'll hurt you at home 

251.99 259.43 B: it can cause some real upsets i know that and especially in marriages and stuff stuff like that uh in relationships 

261.89 264.41 A: (( is mhm yeah i agree with that yeah )) 

263.83 266.12 B: and the bible does say don't gossip 

266.63 267.77 A: that's true 

272.61 274.41 A: i suppose that's the reason 

275.22 279.61 A: it says that 'cause you know you can get hurt feelings 

279.73 282.45 A: and people you know and 

283.60 286.53 A: hurt them and people you don't know 

286.97 288.59 B: was that the ten minute tone 

289.22 291.00 A: i think that was my watch 

290.97 291.81 B: oh 

291.28 295.28 A: (( going off i don't think we've been talking for ten minutes yet [laughter] )) 

296.52 300.22 A: they're supposed to come on and tell us when we've been on ten minutes 

301.88 308.46 B: yeah i think when you uh when you smoke or you drink coffee you tend to hurt yourself more than you do other people obviously you can 'cause you can get 

308.93 311.69 B: irritable if you drink coffee or you can um 

312.42 314.95 B: you can uh you know give people the 

315.32 319.61 B: second hand smoke effect but that's becoming less of a problem these days i suppose 

319.76 324.69 B: but gossip hurts everybody it hurts the gossiper more than anybody but they don't know it 

321.48 322.32 A: yeah 

326.54 329.40 B: 'cause um it really just keeps them in a place where they're 

329.67 334.95 B: still insecure and you know trying to get points with other people rather than dealing with real issues 

335.26 336.81 A: yeah 

342.12 345.16 B: and it's a trap for people too gossip can trap people 

347.57 349.00 B: it's scary 

350.34 352.95 B: so have you got any gossip anything you wanna tell me 

352.44 354.70 A: [laughter]

469.46 471.38 B: yeah 

479.05 480.24 B: i uh 

480.79 485.30 B: i had a problem with a girlfriend about three weeks ago maybe maybe a month ago she 

485.33 491.42 B: she called i called her one day 'cause we were supposed to meet and she didn't show up and it was uh a misunderstanding 

490.73 492.26 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

492.64 499.08 B: and uh it turns out she'd she'd gone to my office a week later she'd picked up some gossip there about me and she 

499.13 500.89 B: chewed me out 

500.27 501.26 A: uh-oh 

501.25 504.04 B: and i still don't know what the whole thing was about 

503.53 505.01 A: she won't tell ya huh 

505.04 510.68 B: she didn't tell me and uh i haven't called her back since then it's been it's been three weeks at least since i talked to her now 

511.48 517.89 B: but uh you know gossip didn't help our little problem that we had there which was an innocent little problem and a misunderstanding 

517.39 519.01 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

518.62 519.83 B: and uh 

520.36 528.25 B: i won't say that it killed the relationship what killed the relationship for me was the fact that it was how she handled it and the fact that she would listen to gossip 

528.47 529.71 B: (( do you know what i'm saying )) 

529.31 531.22 A: yeah instead of listening to you 

531.23 533.17 B: instead of listening to me and you know 

532.99 536.09 A: (( yeah and hearing your side of the story )) 

533.68 534.89 B: fixing 

535.42 540.04 B: right and then fixing something that's broken which is what relationships about a lotta the time you know 

539.92 541.12 A: yeah 

540.48 547.23 B: if it's broken you know you can fix it and move on and and it's just the same as it ain't broke at at all then i think that was the tone 

542.21 542.97 A: [noise] 

545.50 546.32 A: yeah 

548.50 552.96 A: i don't know i just moved my hand and i think i pushed one of these 

552.56 554.68 B: [laughter] 

553.26 556.16 A: (( touch tones [laughter] yeah )) 

555.40 557.51 B: so anyway that i mean that um 

558.36 561.37 B: can i say that it ruined the relationship no um 

561.94 563.31 B: it didn't help 

563.98 565.31 B: and um 

569.49 572.27 B: it does it it bugged me afterwards 

572.47 577.92 B: because i'm trying to sort through all the facts and i don't have the facts but the gossip is something that i can't control 

578.08 578.95 A: yeah 

578.25 580.70 B: you know that's something you can't necessarily fix 

581.44 582.56 B: um 

581.63 584.34 A: (( it seems like uh people believe gossip )) 

584.78 586.49 A: more than they would the truth or 

587.47 599.89 B: that be- believes gossip more than they would the truth that's that's right that's right so in that sense it's pernicious because there's no getting away from it there's there's no uprooting it and throwing it out unless you know where the 

588.12 588.81 A: (( something )) 

591.09 592.05 A: yeah
