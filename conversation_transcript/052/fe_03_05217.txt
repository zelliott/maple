96.05 98.56 A: too many coats or jackets on

108.38 109.62 B: yes indeed

115.18 120.12 B: yes and what i do now is i take a multi vitamin in the morning 

120.08 122.17 B: this way it covers you know 

120.12 121.87 A: (( mm )) 

122.07 136.47 B: everything so i won't be overloading my body with one specific type of vitamin [noise] you know so i just take a multi vitamin every morning you know right with my breakfast you know and it kind of keeps my body at a even keel 

128.26 129.31 A: right 

135.78 150.51 A: [noise] [cough] i think it's also important ah the style what style you eat if you eat ah let's say regular meals during the day a normal breakfast lunch and supper if your general health 

142.66 143.67 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

148.38 149.19 B: uh-huh 

150.37 151.48 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

150.95 156.84 A: it keeps your general health in in in in good ah in good position if you don't eat normally 

156.94 165.72 A: you're more likely to get a cold and also it depends on generally how your body is if you say if you exercise or if you 

159.20 159.96 B: yes 

165.86 174.43 A: in general the type of food you eat is healthy food so your body's more healthy ah people catch less co- people catch ah less colds 

173.68 175.55 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] i agree i )) 

174.68 176.02 A: ah that way 

175.74 180.66 B: it can also though depends [noise] on which climate you live in too like i'm in minnesota 

180.87 181.79 A: okay 

180.96 186.74 B: so we're we have a very long winter climate and a very short summer climate 

186.28 188.16 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

187.04 191.07 B: so sometimes our winter carries over into like 

191.13 192.82 B: may and june 

192.93 194.36 B: most of we have to 

194.63 200.91 B: keep out bodies um bundled up even though some parts of the country are still hot you know 

201.03 205.11 B: here if it's forty degrees outside people are wearing shorts 

201.22 202.12 A: (( [noise] [noise] [mn] )) 

205.55 213.65 B: me i stay in jeans [laughter] you know i'm in jeans and a sweatshirt and maybe a hat if it's really chilly you know 

205.69 207.02 A: (( yeah mm )) 

214.48 215.41 B: (( so uh-huh )) 

214.80 218.85 A: most most a lot of people find that that ah 

219.20 228.74 A: it's not necessarily that they would catch a cold when it's colder sometimes it's more when when the weather changes so sometimes it more when it's 

228.76 229.82 A: like 

230.11 232.41 A: changing hot cold one day 

232.62 247.37 A: it's n- it's not when it's let's say twenty degrees outside when i would catch a cold it's more one it's one day warm and one day cold so i'm used to keep my jacket in the closet 'cause yesterday was warm and i walk out on the street and today's a little bit colder 

246.87 248.02 B: right 

247.98 251.27 A: ah it's easier to catch a cold that way [mn] 

250.48 251.54 B: i agree 

251.70 255.31 B: i agree and see i'm originally from new york from the east coast 

255.34 264.92 B: and it i mean and our seasons normally you know change winter spring summer fall but here they just have winter then summer you know 

264.41 265.52 A: mhm 

264.92 270.77 B: so it's really not like a transitional period where you know the temperatures you know 

270.68 271.24 A: [cough] 

270.86 282.67 B: um they just either very hot or very cold you know and like you said from day to day when it's like hot cold hot cold that's when your body can't really adjust and your immune system can't get really used to 

278.65 279.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

282.87 285.55 B: those you know type of changes [noise] 

286.15 293.46 A: why why do you think [noise] people don't take i believe that most people don't take enough vitamins let's say to prevent colds or other types of things 

293.01 294.26 B: i agree too 

293.51 295.64 A: is it just a lack of ah 

295.69 304.53 A: you know going out and doing it or it's people don't wanna spend the money or what is what is the main reason why a person doesn't 

299.93 300.77 B: (( mhm )) 

304.43 305.28 B: well 

304.69 313.50 A: like you know make sure to take the vit- or maybe it's a lack of just knowing he doesn't know that ah what type of vitamins to take [noise] 

312.59 316.17 B: that's true and plus you know by us by 

316.36 328.62 B: society in general has a busy life you know we're always doing something or keeping ourselves busy sometimes it could be you know not really paying attention enough to our bodies ourselves 

322.06 323.20 A: right 

328.48 329.49 A: mhm 

328.75 343.22 B: and having other things that might seem more important but ultimately our bodies are more important than anything else because if we don't keep up our health then we're not able to do certain things with family with friends with work you know 

343.66 348.73 B: so i think it's more of you know people not paying more attention to self 

348.88 350.42 B: than you know 

350.66 362.58 B: just going on with their day to day activities and not realising that you know your body needs certain type of foods to sustain itself they need certain type of foods to build up to help the immune system you know and not really taking that time out 

354.82 355.77 A: (( [noise] )) 

361.44 362.72 A: (( mm )) 

362.54 365.85 B: you know to really pay more attention to our bodies [noise] 

362.81 364.01 A: (( [cough] mhm )) 

366.41 381.24 A: yeah sometimes it can be that ah younger people i don't know if it's true but younger people catch a cold faster than older people 'cause the older people you know they know when they go outside and the weather is cold 

376.19 376.95 B: (( yes [noise] [noise] )) 

381.41 389.89 A: they know to check if they would need a sweater or a jacket or they make sure to take those vitamins 'cause they they know that their body is more ah 

390.29 394.53 A: likely to you know to catch a cold or 

393.67 394.42 B: (( yeah )) 

394.58 405.22 A: [mn] and younger people you know they think that ah they're still young and healthy and they don't need to do anything about it so sometimes they're m- more likely to catch cold because of that 

400.39 401.68 B: [laughter] 

404.41 407.81 B: and you know something the majority of time when i do get a cold 

407.91 421.63 B: i catch it from a young person [laughter] you know it's not like like i went outside and you know right after i got out the shower in twenty or thirty degree weather i've caught it from some from a young person you know because i i i have a lot of kids 

410.96 412.38 A: mhm 

421.59 428.49 B: and you know sometimes they they don't go outside and bundle up properly so they'll be the first ones to catch a cold 

426.87 436.29 A: mhm [mn] where do you think most colds are picked up like it transferred from person to person or or just going outside in in 

436.59 443.38 B: well i w- i would say i would say most of 'em are are transferred from person to person because 

443.72 454.79 B: people don't wash their hands properly we really don't pay attention to like when we put our hands to our face when we sneeze or something we don't go right to the bathroom and wash our hands like we're supposed to 

445.70 446.99 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

454.23 460.99 A: oh you think like just the handshake with someone who didn't his hands good and he has a cold could transfer the cold to me 

456.87 457.70 B: (( yeah )) 

459.03 459.87 B: (( yeah )) 

460.08 466.48 B: yes indeed yes indeed and and that could very well happen especially in public places where there's public bathrooms 

466.37 476.13 B: you know and t- especially when you know my kids go to school you know i mean as you know the majority of the the air borne you know um 

466.59 467.70 A: mhm 

476.64 482.91 B: um [noise] the viruses and bacterias and stuff are transferred from person to person in in in close spaces you 

477.59 478.29 A: [noise] 

483.05 491.14 B: know especially when the temperature's really humid you know viruses and bacteria have a tendency of multiplying and growing quicker in in warmer 

488.53 489.23 A: (( [cough] [mn] )) 

491.26 494.19 B: um conditions than they do in colder conditions 

494.30 504.31 A: oh so so we're coming down with with another reason to prevent colds i mean another thing another way how to prevent colds is to make sure you go into public places you know 

504.19 505.06 B: yep 

504.48 510.72 A: don't don't ah you know touch what other people touch and ah wash your hands keep yourself hands properly yes yes 

508.17 510.93 B: exactly wash your clean 

511.60 512.50 A: (( mhm )) 

511.82 521.65 B: that's why from i guess from when i was a kid i i really wasn't it wasn't hammered into me [noise] you know continuously you know to wash your hands after coming out the bathroom 

521.45 534.37 B: you know if you use a tissue take that tissue and open up the door with it and then throw it in the trash you know 'cause a lot of people will wash their hands and then grab the door to open up the door and boom there's the transfer of the 

521.69 522.63 A: right 

531.45 533.08 A: right right right 

533.76 545.31 A: i i find that so in new york ah with when travelling on the trains yeah i w- i would never touch the the railing of the you know what i mean 

538.72 539.81 B: oh yes 

543.36 544.91 B: mhm 

544.98 545.71 B: yes 

545.28 552.46 A: i would put like with my sleeves if i don't have a seat and i have to stand i would hold onto it with sleeves 

551.65 552.79 B: yes 

552.89 563.37 B: yes and people think that's strange but it's it's just protection of yourself and others as well because we don't know what type of viruses and bacteria that we've picked up in our travels 

562.36 563.28 A: right 

563.31 570.53 B: you know to transfer onto a handrail or maybe like you said on the subway or the bus you know or even into a public restroom 

570.52 571.30 B: (( you know )) 

570.91 571.71 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

571.24 585.98 B: i i try to instill in my children that you know it's important that you know you wipe the toilet seat off before you sit down there you know and before you touch the faucets at the sink try to wipe it off a little bit then you know proceed to to wash your hands because that transfers 

572.64 573.22 A: (( [cough] )) 

581.96 582.84 A: right 

586.06 587.04 B: i think 

586.34 591.68 A: actually for some reason i find myself going to the doctor 

592.79 599.42 A: i can't say i've missed a winter without having a cold ah even more than once 

596.19 597.06 B: uh-huh 

598.67 599.48 B: okay
