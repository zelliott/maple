0.10 3.98 A: hi this is tho- thomas [noise] 

1.31 2.61 B: hello 

3.59 5.04 B: i'm h- howard 

5.21 9.41 B: um i guess the topic today is bioterrorism 

5.55 6.35 A: (( hi )) 

9.17 10.95 A: yeah 

10.12 12.55 B: um how to prevent bioterrorism 

13.56 17.52 B: um i don't know if duct tape is really worth it [laughter] 

17.56 28.36 B: it seems to be the topic well i remember a while back ago in the news that we were told by i forgot who it was but we were supposed to use duct tape to 

18.00 19.16 A: (( uh-huh [noise] ah )) 

27.39 28.25 A: (( ah )) 

28.59 30.96 B: cover the screens with plastic 

31.29 33.17 A: yeah 

32.48 34.20 B: yeah so 

33.22 36.39 A: i don't think there's gonna be any 

35.92 38.76 B: oh b- you don- yeah but 

36.45 37.35 A: (( so )) 

39.94 43.60 B: i mean what what what can we do to prevent it um 

43.57 44.40 A: (( you know mm )) 

44.96 49.87 A: well just basically do what they say is like use the duct tape 

49.72 50.83 B: duct tape 

50.36 53.80 A: and stuff and just 

54.13 58.10 A: nobody's really ready for it there's 

57.23 66.14 B: yeah yeah th- they seem to be i remember a a while back ago they had a bunch of people with um gas masks and they were selling gas masks 

66.12 67.95 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

67.05 68.32 B: (( eee truckloads )) 

68.36 69.19 B: um the 

68.63 71.98 A: that was like during the war and stuff 

70.91 72.64 B: yeah it was during the war 

73.08 76.69 A: s- yeah the were getting ready for they didn't know 

73.36 74.25 B: (( ah )) 

76.88 79.91 B: yeah well the- and there hasn't been 

78.42 80.40 A: (( i don't think yeah )) 

79.96 80.99 B: (( an- ah hello )) 

80.99 82.63 A: yeah 

81.93 86.67 B: oh and there hasn't really been any you know sort of attack bioterrorism attacks 

86.84 90.73 B: um not not in not in america at least that's what 

89.83 96.05 A: ah well basically if if there was we'd kill everybody 

96.43 99.35 A: and then wouldn't even 

99.54 100.81 A: matter 

100.83 108.16 A: 'cause everybody would be dead if they actually went if they actually did 

103.11 104.11 B: mhm 

108.78 111.64 A: it ah it's just um 

113.21 117.30 A: other countries are just terrorizing us 

117.50 118.41 B: (( uh-huh )) 

117.65 122.42 A: and they just don't like the united states for some reason [noise] um 

122.75 126.62 B: yeah but it's it's an interesting state we're in right now 

126.80 127.90 B: um 

129.06 130.09 B: (( but )) 

130.14 133.01 B: i think to prevent bioterrorism is 

133.48 134.56 B: um 

136.24 146.18 B: yeah it to- it's basically to get ready and to make sure that everything's o- okay i mean they were talking about using crop dusters and stuff like that to 

146.46 147.65 B: cause 

148.09 149.54 B: do bioterrorism 

149.79 154.07 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mm [noise] yeah it's just it's crazy )) 

153.47 156.04 B: yeah it it's certainly um 

156.17 161.10 B: it's a it's more of a fear factor i mean it's more to create 

161.12 162.38 B: fear on 

162.94 166.99 B: on the you know that's why it calls terrorism um [lipsmack] 

168.50 172.69 B: but i don't know if we the people can prevent anything i mean 

172.57 184.71 B: the the most detrimental effect of t- terrorism is the cause of the psychological effects they they could put cause eco- um eco- economical problems where people would just c- are s- 

184.81 188.26 B: stuck in quicksand and can't really do anything 

187.78 189.59 A: yeah 

189.85 193.54 A: (( [noise] yeah it's just i don't know it's just )) 

193.55 198.59 A: i don't think we're gonna have we're gonna have it but you never know it 

197.88 202.67 B: yeah yeah and then just the basic 

202.71 204.20 B: thoughts of how 

204.28 205.36 B: um 

206.77 209.33 B: w- what do you call it ah 

209.45 215.95 B: just normal environmental effects like the wind change and how it blows 

216.30 219.07 B: and and how it can spread across 

219.66 223.80 B: i- it's it all depends on the area 

223.87 224.80 B: um 

225.54 229.70 B: but preventing it's it's it's kinda l- hard thing to do 

229.79 235.53 B: ah once it happens it happens and i don't think anybody who's really has the means to 

235.76 237.48 B: save the masses 

237.50 239.87 A: (( [noise] mm [noise] [noise] ah basically )) 

240.73 248.69 A: if they do do it it's it's probably gonna kill like i said it's gonna kill everybody so 

249.49 255.96 A: if if you don't have a mask ah that's it it's just 

256.08 261.17 A: (( i don't know it's just that's how it is )) 

260.20 261.95 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

262.08 266.01 A: and they talk about preventing it from happening 

266.42 269.09 A: that's like you can't ah 

269.78 275.21 A: you can't prevent anything from happening it it it just happens 

275.74 281.72 B: uh-huh so we any- ah i mean they were talking about like all these different levels of 

282.46 294.20 B: um like charlie bravo the different levels of um state of awareness i i guess they were calling green or red and yellow and um 

291.24 293.49 A: (( ah [noise] [noise] mhm yeah )) 

295.32 296.76 B: (( [noise] ah )) 

297.27 298.51 B: [noise] preventing [noise] 

301.81 311.79 B: yeah i'm not sure how to prevent bioterrorism e- except just to catch 'em at the source and just stop stop 'em from actually starting to plan 

312.00 316.94 B: um figure out people buying the source of buying materials 

317.17 325.20 B: i guess one of the main things for bioterrorism is fertilizers and and also certain kinds of acids 

320.68 329.43 A: ah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well basically we [noise] we 

327.07 327.90 B: (( and )) 

329.66 336.48 A: we have like the security and stuff to prevent a from preventing from happening 

336.91 340.36 A: and and stuff but you don't know 

341.23 345.91 A: it's like somebody can sneak it onto a train and [noise] [noise] 

345.16 356.04 B: mhm yeah but there's always a some sort of trail some sort of money trail where where things are bought things are created and manufactured so where 

354.19 357.24 A: (( yeah )) 

356.86 361.03 B: hello w- where these materials actually come from um 

357.62 358.76 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

362.35 365.86 B: so i guess that could be your one way of preventing bio 

365.91 375.74 B: is to actually know where the materials are actually being generated from and even locating some places where they can can be generated i 

373.56 378.04 A: (( yeah )) 

375.80 378.12 B: mean to really do 

378.35 384.22 B: bioterrorism in the mass scale there has to be a certain amount of equipment 

384.23 385.69 B: ah raw material 

386.20 387.56 A: (( [noise] yeah yeah )) 

386.38 388.54 B: and even a a way to 

389.05 390.72 B: monitor the stuff 

392.75 393.52 B: (( ah )) 

395.74 401.57 A: [noise] i don't know it's like the subway is to have like a bunch of security 

401.67 408.64 A: and and stuff so they're ready for anything now 

408.33 410.24 B: (( eee yeah in the subways yes )) 

409.62 419.46 A: they have the soldiers and stuff in there and stuff even though the war is over they still have them them in the subways 

417.80 419.02 B: yeah but it's 

419.21 424.33 B: there's so many like i just saw in the news the other day that forty seven soldiers had died 

424.48 431.20 B: in the war of iraq i mean e- even though the war of iraq is done there're people there's still people dying out there 

431.65 433.65 B: (( and i i mean )) 

434.14 436.75 B: it's it's really a shame [laughter] 

436.69 448.41 A: yeah uh yeah it's it's a shame that we have to come to another country to rescue them from things that are happening 

447.91 449.30 B: yeah 

448.63 450.41 A: that's like 

451.47 453.03 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

453.27 454.40 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

454.65 455.52 B: (( [noise] )) 

457.16 459.07 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

458.05 459.78 B: but like i say um 

460.38 461.79 B: (( bioterrorism )) 

462.82 463.99 B: let's see 

464.01 470.62 B: what else can be said about bioterrorism besides that it's [laughter] it's very dangerous [noise] 

470.80 471.65 B: um 

472.16 473.68 B: (( w- [noise] i don't know )) 

473.13 473.88 A: mm 

473.90 477.66 A: well biochemicals that 

477.78 480.90 A: they're not really that good 

481.43 486.39 A: if you set them off th- that's it it's gone 

486.39 496.74 B: yeah um but but i think that's like a misconception on um how [noise] um bioterrorism is caused um 

497.01 503.88 B: i- it's it's not like a nuclear war head where if it goes off it just destroys everything in a certain m- mile radius [noise] 

502.07 512.94 A: yeah well n- nuclear a nuclear war that would that would destroy everybody if that if that were to hit 

509.77 512.67 B: (( yeah it w- we'd be we'd be devastated [noise] )) 

514.71 515.68 B: (( [noise] )) 

514.83 524.71 A: [noise] they're talking about that stuff now and it's like they think we're gonna have a nuclear war and all that and it's like 

517.27 518.54 B: (( [noise] )) 

526.04 527.63 A: (( m- m- i don't know [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

527.82 528.84 B: um 

529.49 530.74 B: (( [noise] but )) 

530.90 539.49 B: like for bioterrorism to actually occur there's a a a i- it's it's very different from how like the the dirty nuclear bombs where there're 

539.67 542.35 B: are just trying to radiate an area 

542.87 545.77 B: but with bioterrorism 

545.78 552.03 B: there's usually some sort of way to counter eff- counteract the effects of the chemicals 

552.29 553.27 B: um 

553.37 554.68 B: way of um 

554.80 559.13 B: i mean they've been using this kind of stuff like agent orange in 

559.16 560.91 B: vietnam 

561.42 563.98 B: napalm all that stuff to 

564.20 566.02 B: kill off the vegetation 

566.47 569.29 B: but they still have it causes a lot of 

569.53 576.67 B: genetic effects i mean these are long term effects that don't eff- don't actually happen right away i- 

578.31 581.43 B: i- it's it's sorta hard to say 

582.67 586.23 B: um i guess more research in the area of 

582.77 584.14 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

586.55 589.16 B: (( creating and um )) 

589.66 596.56 B: [lipsmack] neutralizing these effects is pretty much important in preventing bioterrorism 

597.49 599.40 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] mm mm i don't know ))
