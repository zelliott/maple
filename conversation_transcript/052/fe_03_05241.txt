250.39 251.24 A: so 

254.07 265.00 B: office in the uh facility so you know when they gripe about it we just ask 'em how much rent they participate and we we pay over a quarter of the rent so no one gets on to us for playing it we just play wherever we want to 

260.24 260.94 A: (( yeah )) 

261.68 263.35 A: [laughter] 

264.42 274.18 A: yeah we just um there's still some guys who do who um they'll they'll hack between the cubes so they'll like they'll just go out in the aisle and just hack 

271.49 272.94 B: (( [mn] that'd be fun [laughter] )) 

275.18 280.77 A: but i haven't we haven't done the group that i normally hang out hasn't done that in quite a while so 

276.66 277.21 B: (( oh )) 

281.30 286.46 A: now we just we just go out on cigarette breaks you know [laughter] 

284.11 294.03 B: yeah yeah that's i play soccer a couple of times a week and i play basketball every night see i got up to about two hundred and eighty pounds i'm six foot one so it was getting where it was really harming my health 

287.48 288.47 A: oh 

293.76 295.69 A: mhm 

294.03 303.68 B: i could feel it i could feel how much it was harming my health so you know i've dropped a little weight but not a lot but i'm healthier 'cause i'm playing every night i don't mind being two fifty if i'm in good shape but 

300.96 302.67 A: yeah 

303.68 305.96 A: (( true [cough] yeah [mn] )) 

304.50 307.89 B: the overweight the overweight part don't bother me it's it's the people who are 

308.12 314.27 B: if they're like there's a lady i know that's huge like five hundred pound and you know any time she's gonna die 

314.53 316.47 A: yeah 

314.95 322.00 B: there's there's no way your body can push that much weight around and you know she fell one day and we it took six people to pick her up 

321.50 322.66 A: oh 

322.33 334.38 B: it was just horrible and she's just an awesome person and i just feel bad i don't know how to help her and and you know people tried you know to offer her help but you know that'd just be like uh we you wouldn't someone telling you and 

334.62 336.80 B: i wouldn't want someone telling me i couldn't eat a hamburger 

336.46 339.37 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

338.21 344.25 B: so that'd be very difficult it's very difficult but you know when she's when you're five foot two and you're six hundred pounds well that's 

344.35 350.33 B: that's that you're taking your life into your own hands every day that you wake up 

349.27 350.96 A: uh-huh absolutely 

350.36 351.65 B: is a good day 

351.72 353.21 A: (( yeah )) 

353.67 355.24 A: true enough 

355.62 356.40 A: (( so )) 

356.53 359.15 B: i think that personal habits though as far as 

359.13 371.25 B: you know they always talk about personal habits as a bad thing like it's a thing that's it's overweight or drinking and stuff like that but there's so many personal habits you can form that are good like the exercise thing if you every day you get up a take a brisk walk 

368.35 369.29 A: yeah 

371.03 376.25 B: and you do it for you know three or four months pretty soon it'll be part of your routine it'll be a habit 

375.91 377.85 A: mhm 

376.42 383.37 B: you know just like chewing your nails or smoking or any other habit and it would offset a a whole bunch of your smoking and my hamburgers 

382.79 384.79 A: mhm 

384.84 387.99 A: yeah i i i uh [laughter] 

388.56 393.44 A: my uh my wife uh had had gone had started going to a gym

395.97 397.63 B: oh yeah we have one of those here 

397.28 404.53 A: yeah she started going to curves you know i'd i'd get home from work and she'd she'd run off to curves kinda thing 

404.66 416.48 A: and that didn't end up working out 'cause you know half the time the baby was taking her nap right when i was getting home so she wouldn't be able to go 'cause you know the baby's still little and still nurses herself to sleep normally 

414.96 415.78 B: yeah 

417.23 426.76 A: so she ended up having to kill that membership but she's got her little schedule and she has a walk weekly walk planned with her best friend so they they can for a walk every week
