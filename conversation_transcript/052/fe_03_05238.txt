5.30 7.76 A: i'm fine did you get that list 

7.89 10.87 B: (( yeah )) 

8.52 9.56 A: (( it )) 

9.57 10.84 A: went fast 

10.89 16.79 B: yeah it was like personal habits like like which the person thinks is worse 

16.38 25.40 A: yeah but let's see on my list here i've got what they said it's gossiping smoking alcohol or caffeine excessiveness right 

25.15 26.71 B: (( yeah )) 

25.68 28.16 A: overeating or not exercising 

28.17 29.21 B: yeah 

28.80 30.62 A: (( interesting )) 

29.31 31.48 B: i think that was pretty much it 

30.65 31.76 A: okay 

31.99 34.73 A: well do you have any opinion on which you think is worse 

35.10 39.58 B: i can't really comment on the smoking because i smoke [laughter] 

37.79 41.72 A: yeah okay i understand that [laughter] 

40.72 42.17 B: yeah 

42.95 44.14 A: (( oh )) 

44.30 51.97 A: it depends obviously upon the situation my my my gut reaction if i had to choose the one that i think is the worst 

51.60 52.54 B: uh-huh 

52.41 60.44 A: it's ah it's probably excessive alcohol just because i think there's a greater chance it can impact other people 

56.11 57.94 B: yeah 

60.47 61.91 B: yeah 

60.47 72.80 A: in the short run like drunken driving and things like that um i personally think that's that's like really bad excessive caffeine i don't know anybody they can be irritable but then nobody's ever died from excessive caffeine or 

63.65 65.82 B: yeah 

73.02 78.94 A: irritated other people to death [laughter] with excessive caffeine 

75.50 78.88 B: yeah yeah 

79.05 85.02 B: on on the caffeine note i can't really comment on that either [laughter] i've got a big two liter sitting next to me as well 

84.53 85.64 A: of what 

85.60 86.63 B: pepsi 

86.29 90.60 A: oh well i drink diet coke but only one or two cans a day that's all 

90.22 92.09 B: yeah 

90.96 92.69 A: that's not too bad 

92.39 94.28 B: yeah 

93.11 98.76 A: um well jeeze you got a couple of these covered yourself i don't do any of those things 

97.68 99.91 B: [laughter] 

98.83 103.07 A: i don't drink too much caffeine or too much smoke i don't smoke my god 

102.93 104.86 B: yeah 

103.59 104.55 A: it's like a 

104.99 110.30 B: well there is also gossiping i'm not too fond of that because that always impacts everybody 

109.45 112.08 A: yeah it does but um 

112.38 119.55 A: you know i'm not a big believer in gossiping around the water cooler and half the time if you do it it comes back to haunt you anyway because people then 

119.73 125.89 A: quote what you said or miss quote what you said or say you were gossiping and it all gets out of hand so 

125.14 126.98 B: yeah 

125.91 134.58 A: my and you know especially if you're working for the most part you can't trust people so your best bet is not to gossip with anybody 

134.38 137.58 B: yeah yeah 

136.54 143.03 A: my experience is what is the ultimate famous quote from some business person if you want a friend in business get a dog 

144.70 151.50 B: yeah unless it's like the borscher's baked beans or whatever dog and it ends up telling everybody [laughter] 

150.61 164.64 A: yeah well that's true i mean i think gossiping can be very dangerous my experience is when people have come to me and wanted to gossip i just sit there and listen and i don't say very much because it only gets you in trouble and then maybe sometimes they stop coming to you 

164.64 166.47 B: yeah 

166.48 170.21 B: yeah because i remember back in grade school like i was always 

169.98 179.09 B: like the blunt end of all the gossip and everything and it always it always just ended up coming back and hurting the person that they were gossiping about because 

178.87 187.78 B: usually it wasn't even true and the people would just believe whoever and they wouldn't even go the source to see if it was true or not 

189.15 197.42 A: i think that's right i think that's right gossiping can be very dangerous i don't think it's the worst personal habit but i think it can be very dangerous 

193.18 194.97 B: yeah 

197.59 200.62 A: i think it's something i do less and less of as i get older 

200.67 201.84 A: for sure 

200.94 203.98 B: yeah 

202.17 211.19 A: but um actually smoking it depends it can be bad it depends on where you're doing it of course now you can do it fewer and fewer places 

211.06 212.12 B: (( yeah they're )) 

211.38 213.05 A: (( um it's not like )) 

212.14 214.13 B: starting to chase it out of places 

213.84 218.30 A: yeah you can't like do it in restaurants as much anymore depending on where you live or 

218.32 220.90 A: on trains or things like that god 

219.50 222.54 B: yeah 

220.96 223.62 A: it's like you can only do it in your own home [laughter] 

223.10 224.66 B: yeah pretty much 

224.68 234.16 B: and then like where i go to school at like they're trying to pass a city ordnance that there's no smoking in any public places like even at a bus stop or whatever 

233.46 235.62 A: oh what city is that 

235.10 237.08 B: it's in bloomington indiana 

236.46 237.87 A: oh okay 

238.15 238.95 A: hm 

239.15 240.03 A: wow 

240.52 247.00 B: yeah i don't i don't think it'll pass though because there's just so many smokers around that you know 

247.11 252.81 B: it just wouldn't be very conceivable you know it'd be like a fifty fifty vote 

254.00 256.22 A: they did something like that in new york 

256.27 260.32 A: you can't smoke like almost anywhere anymore you can't smoke in any offices 

260.36 261.41 B: wow 

260.80 270.35 A: you can't even have like smoking rooms or like which is headquartered in new york you can't they can't nobody can smoke there anywhere period yeah 

268.86 272.19 B: wow i did i did not know that 

271.28 276.17 A: this went into effect a couple of months ago the mayor of new york really hates smoking 

276.26 284.10 A: and so he got this law passed and you know i understand that you know but you'd think should get an exception for god sakes 

283.89 285.72 B: yeah 

284.24 292.01 A: [laughter] if you're smoking marlboro cigarettes you should be able to ah smoke them in the company in the headquarters of the company that makes them 

291.52 293.33 B: yeah 

292.29 298.98 A: and let's see what else have we got here overeating to me is not i don't know it's a personal sin it's your problem 

298.91 300.69 B: yeah 

299.82 308.30 A: i've done it but you know i don't think it's a terrible personal habit unless you're stuffing twinkies down your throat in front of other people [laughter] 

304.00 305.76 B: yeah 

307.63 312.07 B: yeah then it then it starts to get kind of just annoying 

311.57 316.51 A: yeah but it doesn't it's not me the wor- as bad as like excessive alcohol 

315.94 330.15 B: yeah because excessive alcohol i've got some friends that'll they'll just they'll sit there and they'll go to a keg or whatever and they'll just get so trashed they don't even remember the party and that's just one of those points where okay why did you go there in the first place then 

324.94 325.94 A: yeah 

329.82 331.97 A: you could have just stayed home and done that 

331.47 345.65 B: yeah yeah it's like okay if i go to party i'd like to remember the party especially like if a bar if there's a cover charge you know i'd like to i could probably spend that money somewhere else [laughter] 

336.87 338.15 A: yeah i guess 

345.23 351.82 A: that's a good point i hadn't really thought about that but that's true that's true and the last one not exercising you know 

352.05 353.84 A: i guess that's um 

354.51 358.67 A: you know it's a personal sin again it doesn't really affect other people unless you 

358.82 364.46 A: i don't know unless you consider it a global sin if people don't exercise and get fat and die there's a co- 

364.65 372.00 A: cost to society of people being unhealthy but you know what did i just hear in new was it new york they want a tax 

367.82 369.78 B: yeah 

372.01 373.67 A: like bad food 

373.99 375.88 B: really 

374.48 386.34 A: yeah mcdonalds and potato chips and so on i think it was new york i was watching the today show or whatever this morning and it's like i think it's just a really bad idea who's to say what's good and what's bad 

383.54 385.69 B: yeah 

385.89 389.48 B: yeah exactly it's it's not up to 

389.64 393.53 B: like the lawmakers or whatever it's up to the consumer 

392.83 398.13 A: well they say you know cigarettes they say are bad but they put little warning labels on it you know 

397.88 399.28 B: yeah 

398.48 403.79 A: that's different but i don't think government the other thing is it it sometimes it's very um 

403.77 408.59 A: it's very ah open to debate because for example some people think cheese 

408.40 419.01 A: like if you eat cheese it's bad but if you follow a low carbohydrate diet like i do cheese is good because it's high it's not not because it's high in fat but because it's low in carbohydrates 

414.17 415.95 B: yeah 

418.85 419.85 B: yeah 

419.04 432.55 A: so you know it's everything's relative and who do i want who's making these decisions the government can't even agree so [laughter] it's very very interesting it's very interesting to figure out who who would determine that 

432.28 442.83 B: yeah because you know it's just like the adage one man's trash is another man's treasure you know one's person's junk food could be another person's daily diet 

442.49 446.81 A: well right and the other thing is that actually i heard this and i think it's true and that is 

446.79 449.74 A: um a lot of people who eat 

449.67 454.89 A: the junkiest food are often lower income people because let's face it mcdonalds is cheap 

454.48 456.26 B: yeah 

454.82 466.98 A: you know and so you can go and get a happy meal or or or big mac and fries and a soda for three fifty but where else can you eat for three fifty and walk out full you know it's probably the only place 

461.29 463.03 B: yeah 

463.44 466.99 B: yeah yeah 

467.01 478.15 A: so there's a lot of um belief that that's just not not a good thing that's not a good thing and i happen to agree with that no taxing mcdonalds i ate there last weekend [laughter] 

477.36 487.93 B: yeah it just charging more money for food that's bad for you just it it's pointless but it's kind of like the cigarette tax they 

484.06 485.61 A: yeah i agree with you 

487.92 494.79 B: charge you know like an extra seventy five to a dollar on cigarettes before you even pay for it jus- 

494.82 499.47 B: just because they have tobacco in there and they're trying to regulate it 

497.39 503.81 A: yeah d- do you know what somebody told me a pack of cigarettes in manhattan cost from a vending machine 

503.62 504.93 B: how much 

504.19 505.61 A: six dollars 

505.49 506.60 B: wow 

506.11 508.21 A: yeah i mean nobody 

507.21 511.93 B: here in indy here in indiana it's like three twenty five for a pack at a a 

511.96 514.38 B: gas station 

512.96 515.34 A: (( that's not well that's half of manhattan )) 

515.26 517.07 B: yeah 

515.73 519.33 A: [laughter] it's crazy it's crazy 

519.98 525.63 A: well so have we covered all the personal habits we haven't filled up our ten minutes brandon it's not good 

524.92 534.42 B: yeah i notice that it's like i was on i was talking earlier and like we started to get off topic because you know ten minutes is quite a long time and 

534.59 537.76 A: can you do more than one of these calls in a day i guess 

537.96 552.10 B: ah i don't know i just like i got off the phone i was talking to a friend of mine then i called back to see if i could and well here i am [laughter] so i don't like i don't think they would you know get mad at you for it because it's just more research but i don't know 

545.49 547.47 A: yeah yeah 

551.75 553.68 A: well interesting 

553.82 559.12 A: it's always some- it's interesting interesting they need better topics [laughter] 

557.85 562.25 B: yeah yeah or like a topic that changes from hour to hour 

562.17 566.85 A: although this is the first time i've ever done it so i don't know what if it changes every day 

566.82 570.06 B: yeah i had the same topic as well this is my second call 

570.15 572.68 A: oh that's true that's true 

572.01 576.02 B: technically my third but i missed the first one because my phone was on silent mode 

575.70 576.64 A: oh 

576.83 590.25 A: somebody hung up on me i said hello and they hung up i'm like okay i guess they don't like my this is not a sex line you don't have to get turned on by my voice whoever you are [laughter] sorry i didn't mean to be so personal about it why 

580.32 581.76 B: [laughter] 

584.51 587.19 B: (( yeah )) 

589.32 593.05 B: don't worry don't don't don't even worry about it 

591.93 595.49 A: are you hanging up on my voice [laughter] that was bizarre 

595.51 599.89 A: so wow i guess that they they're adver- advertising this because i'm in the philadelphia area
