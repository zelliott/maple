19.27 23.17 A: ah though they dug up that pool appar- or drained it rather 

23.38 25.00 B: they drained the pool 

24.79 30.31 A: yeah in maryland you know they they still think that that guy what's his name philnick 

30.24 37.27 B: oh the pond they drained the water from the pond to find some kind of um evidence but i don't know 

34.24 35.66 A: yeah 

36.09 41.78 A: (( i think that he actually went into a pond went underwater and do you know what i mean i don't know )) 

42.61 48.04 A: how to trust the f._b._i. because if you remember when that richard jewell thing 

48.34 51.60 A: they were convinced he bombed atlanta 

51.02 52.74 B: right [laughter] [laughter] 

51.87 56.55 A: and now they've got rudolph the red nosed wh- [laughter] 

57.52 61.65 A: (( ah you know what i mean when they hatfill that's his name )) 

61.95 63.21 A: hatfill 

62.15 64.25 B: oh right hatfill yes 

64.04 69.54 A: yeah yeah so ah i don't know about bioterrorism it worries me but [lipsmack] 

69.46 76.06 B: well you know it's a real problem because it c- c- it could come without your knowing it when you're least aware 

76.15 77.16 A: mm 

76.25 80.51 B: um because there's no warning signs i mean it could get into the water 

80.06 83.90 A: (( yeah but isn't how to aerosolize it that's the problem )) 

83.40 85.21 B: the what 

84.21 85.94 A: aerosolize it 

86.19 88.83 A: i mean how to deliver bioterror 

86.34 87.16 B: (( ah )) 

89.35 91.62 B: yes but you know it can be done 

92.21 97.63 B: they can put ah ah chemicals in that that don't activate for 

97.67 99.79 B: a long time 

98.90 103.61 A: yeah i know yeah i would think the first target for it would've been somewhere like 

103.92 106.71 A: (( ah israel or europe )) 

107.22 108.21 B: right 

107.27 109.79 A: 'cause obviously it's gonna come from ah 

110.18 111.84 A: al qaeda isn't it 

112.66 115.31 A: or a homegrown nutcase i don't know 

112.85 113.78 B: (( ah )) 

114.55 118.20 B: yeah probably probably al qaeda though 

118.11 121.67 A: (( yeah and if it's al qaeda have they got the technology )) 

122.21 125.82 A: i don't think they found it in afghanistan really 

125.42 126.55 B: no 

127.04 129.09 A: and if you look at iraq 

129.42 134.37 A: however connected they are to al qaeda they didn't they found a couple of old 

134.38 136.43 A: mobile labs you know 

136.38 137.36 B: yes 

137.45 141.78 A: i live very close to new york city so i'm very worried about it 

141.70 146.14 B: ah yes well i understand i live in new york city also so 

145.53 149.70 A: (( oh l- yeah but i live on long island i know it sounds crass but )) 

150.34 156.78 A: you know if you live on long island you know i mean we only need like a bit of bad weather and we don't get any food supplies 

156.49 157.86 B: this is true [laughter] 

157.59 161.93 A: you know the only way to escape is to have a boat on the north shore or something 

162.73 165.71 A: [laughter] which i can't afford [laughter] 

165.14 166.97 B: right 

166.54 170.83 A: but you know aren't you more worried about maybe they'd attack indian point 

171.91 173.04 B: um 

174.50 179.80 B: ah that's possible i don't know where ah where is indian point that it's going to 

179.19 187.86 A: well it's just i- it's up in westchester county it's on you know like it's in connecticut i mean i'm sorry it's oh no it's about 

183.14 184.22 B: oh the 

187.09 188.92 B: it's the nuclear site 

188.45 194.92 A: yeah it's the nuclear site well the- they crash a plane into it you know we'll get the ah what they call the flu 

192.36 193.29 B: (( mm )) 

195.61 198.42 A: which i suppose is a biological attack isn't it 

195.71 196.58 B: oh i 

198.71 202.59 B: yeah because if they're gonna mix chemicals it's all part of that 

202.35 204.31 A: yeah mm 

204.74 206.49 A: i well it worries me 

205.37 209.22 B: i'm just worried about the food supply and the basic needs like water 

209.61 212.32 A: yeah well i i only drink bottled water 

213.54 217.89 A: (( ah you know and i always buy about a couple of cases of it )) 

217.36 219.29 B: oh is that right 

218.40 221.05 A: (( yeah but i don't think that's gonna last long enough )) 

221.16 223.00 B: well that's smart 

222.85 228.51 A: do you know what i mean but i mean you know i've got a filtering system but i still don't trust the tap water really 

227.98 234.22 B: well but even the filtering system ah how is it gonna stop the chemicals that're already in the water 

232.59 237.96 A: yeah what type of what what type of bio attack do you think we're looking at here 

239.71 247.22 B: well i think something that's gonna get into the food supply or the water supply so mhm 

246.60 259.80 A: yeah they've been talking about that water thing recently 'cause some al qaeda nutcase said that they were thinking 'cause all our reservoirs are upstate and if they put something in that 

256.37 257.65 B: right 

259.22 260.12 B: right 

260.52 261.97 A: yeah 

261.36 265.17 B: but i think it could be also a gas that just would um 

265.51 266.50 A: mm 

265.88 268.62 B: you know you'd breathe in and wouldn't even know it 

268.67 269.77 A: mm 

269.41 272.80 B: and then it gets into your nervous system and 

272.13 275.71 A: yeah there's only so far you can with these precautions 

275.74 277.09 B: (( ah correct )) 

276.35 280.28 A: because if you're really that worried you've just gotta move 

280.53 282.04 B: well this is true 

281.54 286.79 A: because i think you know there's only ah it's it's gonna be a major population center 

287.09 291.81 A: um there's no point in them releasing it in the middle of montana whatever it is 

291.64 297.17 B: yeah they wanna cripple the economy [sigh] at the same time as putting a lot of people out of commission 

294.91 297.74 A: well it worked with september the eleventh didn't it 

297.50 298.81 B: well this is true 

298.76 302.70 A: and that was a b- massive multi billion dollar hit 

302.78 306.86 B: yes i think it's it was priceless you 

306.45 308.82 A: (( yeah so those bastards you know )) 

306.99 309.32 B: can't really estimate the impacts 

309.49 313.37 B: because if you estimate it on all levels it's ah 

313.49 315.45 B: it's ah irreplaceable 

315.61 320.08 A: yeah and i think any bio attack would come from a similar 

320.13 323.93 A: demographic i don't wanna sound racist 

323.00 324.59 B: mhm 

324.13 327.27 A: you know but i mean they were saudis 

327.07 328.47 B: mhm 

327.92 332.30 A: this country has got to do something i'm english by the way my wife's american 

332.14 333.00 B: uh-huh 

332.99 340.77 A: but i mean i didn't desperately wanna come here i met my wife in england and we had to come here because her mother was ill 

341.14 344.04 A: now she's in hospital and you know 

344.10 347.93 A: so basically i but i mean london's just as bad as as here 

347.98 348.96 B: yes 

348.50 350.18 A: (( as a target )) 

350.59 353.90 A: i lived through all that i._r._a. stuff in london you know 

353.40 354.74 B: oh right 

354.39 356.26 A: (( a friend of mine died )) 

356.69 362.81 A: (( you know like in my arms practically just outside a pub that i was working in )) 

359.35 360.55 B: oh my gosh 

362.86 364.13 B: oh my goodness 

363.61 365.84 A: so i'm used to the terrorist bit 

365.98 368.26 A: (( but they they were just bombs )) 

367.94 368.79 B: (( mm )) 

368.78 372.12 A: this they they've gone to a different level now 

372.67 378.24 A: you know and i'm not sure ah the size of this country you've got that massive canadian border 

379.23 381.99 A: and c- canada is notorious for just 

381.34 385.01 B: yeah it's the poorest border you can get across so many places 

384.36 387.91 A: yeah i mean i've been to canada and no one's ever asked me for 

388.25 389.56 A: anything 

388.94 390.25 B: right 

390.01 393.79 A: you know and i've been to mexico and no one's ever asked me for anything [laughter] 

393.33 394.65 B: right 

394.22 396.20 A: so i'm thinking you know 

397.12 402.70 A: you know and i think those borders are just too big so i think you know i don't know we've got to ah 

403.58 410.63 A: oh i don't know [sigh] i can't see the only thing we c- we could possibly lower our profile internationally 

410.32 411.31 B: yes 

411.60 421.67 A: make us less of a target but i think that would be ridiculous because i believe that the people who are gonna get us just resent us because of our lifestyle 

421.41 428.46 B: i don't think we'll ever become less of a target so there's no way we can lower our profile and not be who we are [laughter] 

423.63 424.61 A: yeah 

427.77 432.23 A: that's right um they just don't like us because we're westerners 

428.64 429.87 B: i mean that's it 

432.94 442.05 A: you know because they just don't like us because well i'm a christian i don't know what you are but if you're a christian or a jew or you're not one of their religions they don't like that 

441.44 443.09 B: right 

442.39 445.12 A: and they seem to they they're going on about this c- [sigh] 

445.80 448.88 A: this jihad they wanna get us all 

449.01 450.00 B: mhm 

449.49 455.82 A: and they won't be happy 'til we're all dead so we have to take a proactive role and go and get them 

454.91 458.57 B: yes but where do you think the bioterrorism will come from 

458.27 460.39 A: where do i think it will come from 

460.98 471.50 A: i think it's not gonna be organized from within the ah middle east or anywhere like that i think what it's gonna be is because there's enough ah 

471.92 476.35 A: muslim fundamentalists who already live in this country 

475.45 476.22 B: (( mm )) 

476.41 479.71 A: and there's enough information available on the internet 

480.26 488.55 A: that they're gonna suddenly just get the idea there's gotta be they've gotta be out there already and you can't expect the f._b._i. to monitor everybody 

488.01 489.32 B: mhm 

489.37 493.32 A: and you know with the borders being so poor s- there'll just be an attack 

493.18 494.36 B: right 

493.46 497.36 A: we have to educate ourselves and be prepared for the attack 

497.65 501.25 A: and do whatever we can to limit the extent of the attack 

500.56 508.84 B: well there're people that i mean m- all of israel has gas masks i've never heard of anything about that here and if we live in new york area 

508.81 514.27 A: yeah but is- israel is a much more confined community isn't it i mean it's it's much more dense 

508.98 509.81 B: i 

513.51 514.81 B: (( d- yes )) 

514.63 517.49 A: and i think israel is about the size of jersey 

518.11 519.32 B: (( mm mm mm )) 

518.12 519.06 A: you know 

519.52 523.83 A: ah you know well y- [laughter] new york as well is very very dense 

524.10 536.32 A: but you've got to also think of [lipsmack] i don't know i think a gas mask is a good idea but it seems to me if i had to carry a gas mask around all the time i would feel like those people had won 

536.78 540.21 B: well they have won haven't they [laughter] in so many many ways 

540.04 541.04 A: mm 

541.03 542.80 B: they've instilled fear 

543.28 549.09 B: they've instilled ah this kind of conversation that we never used to have [laughter] 

548.29 551.99 A: no we'd be talking about baseball if this was a few years ago 

551.10 555.69 B: right you know we wouldn't have the care and concern about our [sigh] 

555.70 557.80 B: our livelihood or our lives 

557.57 561.56 A: well i'm fifty years old i worry about kids growing up now 

561.22 563.61 B: uh-huh oh it's a horrible time 

561.93 568.28 A: with no ah concept of you know like i mean they're gonna be attacked by people they don't know 

568.24 570.60 B: yeah it's a horrible time to be born in 

568.54 572.09 A: for reasons they don't understand 

571.22 573.60 B: unstable very unstable world 

573.16 578.87 A: using methods that can be i mean have you heard of ah botulism 

579.15 580.23 B: um 

579.65 581.86 A: the botulinum virus 

582.58 584.09 B: (( it gets into your )) 

582.64 585.58 A: that is so disgusting you know what i mean 

584.54 586.63 B: it gets into your intestines 

586.44 591.80 A: well it affects your entire body you break out in scabs basically you've got a few hours you know 

591.26 592.86 B: mm mm and 

592.25 593.95 A: it's like the black death 

594.12 595.91 B: where does that come from 

595.74 599.89 A: well it's always been about it's always existed but
