90.38 90.94 B: (( [cough] )) 

91.17 99.98 B: [laughter] okay that's kind of an interesting thought because i i only watch news that's my ah 

95.72 96.63 A: (( [mn] ahah )) 

99.88 106.46 B: but um ah ah if you talk about joe millionaire and all of that kind of shows which is kind of reality t._v. 

104.69 105.60 A: yeah 

106.25 117.03 B: um a lot of women in my office they just talk about that joe millionaire all the time so it depends what kind of a show you are talking about [mn] and when it was survivor 

111.48 112.40 A: yeah 

115.13 116.26 A: yeah 

117.13 124.07 B: um i remember that um i think it's still going on but ah i think it ah the first was really popular 

125.03 127.47 B: the first survivor show was really popular 

125.18 130.99 A: yeah it was ah th- that's actually what started the whole reality t._v. craze 

130.76 132.15 B: mhm 

131.52 135.34 A: it like right right on the on the success of the first survivor 

134.99 135.85 B: (( ahah )) 

135.32 148.25 A: um a- all of a sudden there was all these other so called reality shows and per- and you know for for myself i don't i don't find these to be very reality based anyway it's just like a marketing term ah 

147.77 149.56 B: (( exactly i totally )) 

148.53 157.99 A: you know ah none of the people i know in the real world behave ah i- in such a fashion and ah i i don't know i find it very unreality you know 

156.72 162.18 B: [mn] well probab- probably you will you will be the best person to tell because you were involved in that show 

162.26 165.02 B: so do you think that they know like they 

164.80 172.14 B: if if i'm remembering remembering it right because i ah i haven't watched that show for a long time the the joe millionaire 

170.50 171.47 A: yeah 

171.91 177.36 B: that all these women who are wanting to ah you know get married to joe 

177.12 189.91 B: and ah they didn't ah joe didn't know that ah she will get or whichever girl he will get married to she will get a million dollars and i don't believe that that he won't know that 

177.34 177.90 A: (( [mn] )) 

186.20 187.13 A: right 

190.37 196.27 A: yeah i don't i don't know on on survivor um [lipsmack] um nobody knew who was gonna win 

196.62 207.27 A: they had people you know on call back ah ah when i came back ah to the united states and the show came on so we had already taped the show so i knew the the outcome 

202.09 203.03 B: okay 

203.71 204.43 B: mhm 

206.93 208.73 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

207.78 218.01 A: but um and people were constantly asking me um come on you guys i- it was a set up y- you must have known it's like no no one knew who was gonna win and everyone wanted me to tell them 

218.21 220.30 B: [mn] you actually knew that 

218.26 219.67 A: and i 

220.33 228.23 A: ah but we n- ah well i knew because see when we fil- we we videotaped the show and then 

222.09 223.81 B: you can't disclose that 

227.00 229.75 B: yeah but you didn't know that who was gonna win 

229.55 233.52 A: ahead of time no i- it's not set up that way no n- nobody knew 

233.49 235.53 B: nobody knew that 

234.77 246.08 A: no ah 'cause i mean it was like an actual competition and ah and they had games we we were on an island for quite a while and ah all the writers were out there and they were [mn] ah 

239.91 240.72 B: so 

245.97 253.85 A: oh making up the games ah that that were the the contestants were gonna play right right there so 

252.65 259.86 B: okay i have a i have a question ah did you tape the last show before it has went on the air or the last show 

258.89 263.53 A: oh yeah the whole show the whole show every episode was taped bef- 

262.53 267.08 B: okay so then you have taped the last show you knew the results 

267.46 280.34 A: yes oh but see i- i'm sorry i m- i misunderstood your question i thought um you you were saying did did i know ah like was it staged like did we know even before we started filming the show who was going to be the winner 

279.77 286.45 B: well th- that's perfectly i i totally agree with you when it's the same thing when you go on a you know o- on a 

286.21 295.33 B: on any quiz ah show you don't know there were there were like two movies ah made on that ah whole issue that 

295.14 301.56 B: when the passed the information to the ah to the contestant that what kind of a question they were going to ask 

301.56 313.67 A: no yeah but see what i'm saying in in i- on survivor um like the the the producers of the show didn't didn't know that the guy who ended up winning was going to win 

312.30 313.11 B: (( ahah )) 

313.70 314.85 B: yeah that's 

314.01 320.80 A: w- we knew as being being on the crew filming the show because you know n- the general public doesn't know 

317.42 318.42 B: yeah 

320.57 322.81 A: anything about it yet so of course 

322.58 333.39 A: there's a small handful of people in the world who do know who the winner was but we were there for all the competitions and and ah a- and i- it could have been anybody who won 

329.49 330.53 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

333.16 345.99 A: so i think they were pretty honest ah w- with that you know i mean because they they made a bunch of games and who- whoever played it best ah wins but um [mn] ah ah just to 

336.95 337.92 B: okay 

346.28 350.93 A: stick with the topic o- of of this of this service we're doing here um 

349.58 350.58 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

351.12 354.39 A: [mn] i'm not quite sure why these shows are so popular 

354.64 367.71 B: th- that's that's the main thing because in most of the other shows ah which you watch you kind of think that everything is kind of preplanned and this ah reality t._v. that's why it's so popular because 

367.61 377.50 B: ah you know nobody knows which will what will be the outcome of that and in other shows when we watch the other shows y- they they are kind of preplanned 

371.29 372.20 A: (( yes )) 

377.37 391.54 A: ri- right well like and and they're and they're really kind of sn- they're sneaky you know like this joe millionaire just ah you know the girls all know that whoever gets to marry this guy's gonna get a million dollars but the guy the you know joe millionaire doesn't know 

377.55 379.48 B: that yeah 

382.07 383.50 B: mhm 

391.40 400.45 B: so do you believe that joe millionaire never knew that he's ah that ah the girl he's go- he's gonna get married ah she she will get the million dollars 

400.41 405.22 A: um i don't i don't know i don't know i have no idea how to answer that ah it 

404.41 407.06 B: what is your educated guess 

406.85 410.62 A: [mn] i would say that he probably doesn't know 

410.50 411.38 B: (( mm )) 

411.40 412.87 A: but 

412.32 414.16 B: well then that that that [mn] 

413.14 417.43 A: but but see but i i don't know how how how ah accurate that can be because 

417.46 429.29 A: um [mn] i mean what did they have this guy sequestered and locked away so he couldn't communicate with anybody until the show was ah finished you know because somebody sh- mu- you know must have told him somebody watching the show 

427.68 438.69 B: that that that's what my point is and you probably just explained your ah you know just give your answer to your question that's why [mn] these shows are much popular 

430.27 431.41 A: yeah 

438.47 447.74 B: on ah on the basis of that that nobody knows the outcome of that and if you think that they are honest like you just said it about the survivor show 

442.62 443.71 A: right 

447.49 448.47 A: yeah 

447.88 450.31 B: that nobody knew who was gonna be the winner [mn] 

450.21 451.15 A: yeah 

450.30 457.89 B: in the same manner they might have protected the information and ah kind of d- didn't disclose that ah 

457.85 463.72 B: and i i i don't know when when you are in such an intimate relationship with 

463.67 475.28 B: with joe when ah all these women are [mn] ah filming all of that episodes ah they might not have told her [mn] told him that if you will marry me [mn] 

475.39 487.33 B: they might have struck a deal between them and yeah they they will say if you will marry me i will pay you fifty percent of the money which i will get so so wh- who knows because they will 

477.97 479.91 A: yes yeah 

483.50 485.71 A: [mn] right right 

486.21 487.99 A: yeah exactly who knows 

487.60 491.53 B: yeah who knows so but but the general public is 

488.76 489.99 A: yeah 

491.62 495.06 B: [mn] probably have a low i._q. [laughter] 

493.76 496.03 A: i know actually this is the problem 

495.87 504.88 B: yeah and i think that that that's why these shows are so popular because general pub- public don't think the way we both are thinking 

504.26 512.12 A: no no they don't and ah i think ah especially in this country i hate to say it ah the the less people have to think the happier they are 

512.02 513.09 B: [mn] [mn] [mn] 

512.15 519.47 A: and that's really that's a really sad sad state of of a country's consciousness you know 

515.70 518.03 B: (( [laughter] )) 

518.55 526.60 B: [laughter] and i think that ah i don't know whether you heard of that expression that says that ignorance is blessing 

526.53 530.06 A: yeah yeah we say we say ah ah ignorance is bliss 

529.91 534.09 B: yeah ignorance is bliss so so w- we are living in a bliss 

531.47 535.70 A: right but you know what i like to know i like to know things 

535.39 536.16 B: (( [mn] )) 

536.02 538.74 A: so i i ask too many questions you know 

537.96 544.30 B: yeah that- that's the way exactly i am but you you don't find too many people like us 

540.42 541.45 A: yeah 

543.92 555.23 A: yeah and that's why this is one reason i said a- at the beginning of ah of our conversation that i haven't had a television or i haven't had any t._v. shows for seven years it's changed my life i can't stand the television set 

544.65 545.45 B: and 

554.70 555.97 B: [laughter] 

555.24 563.96 A: i think most of the stuff that comes in ah even the news you said you liked to watch the news ah and i think it's it's most of it's propaganda it's like who who 

559.22 560.10 B: (( ahah [mn] )) 

564.04 570.20 A: who's in charge of the news what do they want to get you to believe why are they telling you these things and mostly 

567.57 568.27 B: well 

569.12 583.11 B: that's why i love people from california because they are so open minded and ah ah you know the rest of the world and all the other people ah who watch this t._v. they they just they just believe they just 

580.40 585.60 A: they just buy it they think that they that it's the truth just because somebody on the t._v. is telling it 

583.24 584.21 B: yes 

585.11 586.57 B: yes and 

585.61 589.87 A: they they don't stop to think that who's in charge of the t._v. you know 

588.53 599.95 B: and exac- i i that's why you know most of these democrats thinks that ah you know ah people from california are weird but i i think that they are the most liber-
