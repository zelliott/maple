24.96 27.10 A: found any interest in

31.31 33.73 A: why do i wanna watch it 

33.58 35.34 B: well you watch the news 

35.38 41.34 A: well i mean actually i guess you're absolutely right i'm a news addict but i mean 

41.39 44.82 A: so i'm but that's i guess that's real reality 

45.10 48.70 B: really reality yeah some of these shows 

46.92 51.40 A: i mean survivor i mean how stupid was that 

48.80 50.44 B: yeah 

50.76 52.42 B: [laughter] 

51.60 53.99 A: i mean really i mean 

54.82 55.81 A: (( i don't know )) 

57.57 63.76 B: huh i didn't watch that either but i have watched some of those shows um mainly the dating shows 

64.11 74.74 B: i i find them interesting when they're when they're not too you know i think some of them are are fake um but some of them i i get the feeling are not and they're 

74.68 79.94 B: it's sort of like watching a documentary that's been edited to be entertaining 

79.89 84.93 A: you think you i mean you don't think that they're not completely played up i mean 

86.52 88.70 B: uh okay well 

86.64 89.83 A: completely s- scripted 

88.89 93.49 B: i don't i don't know i can only trust my own 

94.32 101.00 B: feeling of whether something is believable or not and some of them are believable to me 

97.12 98.74 A: right 

100.90 104.89 B: um there was one of them that was so ridiculous that i even 

104.68 112.65 B: searched on the internet to see what i could find out about it and found out that yes indeed that some of the lines were 

112.46 123.75 B: made up by the producers but that that was a show that i watched i felt you know these these people are not acting like real people that i know but there's other shows that i've watched and i it's rung more true for me 

123.69 132.21 A: well it's like a movie i mean you know they say the movie is based on a true story you can't follow the true story that would get kinda boring 

132.28 135.88 A: so you know they have to put a few different things and that's 

136.06 141.84 A: that is you know a fact but i don't know i just 

142.67 144.30 A: i just never 

144.76 150.18 A: never had the you know i mean never had the the want to sit down and watch any 

150.29 153.08 A: but then again i guess that's just 

153.93 154.79 A: you know 

154.63 169.25 A: i mean i just i am such a news addict when i sit down to watch any t. v. if i'm going to do that it usually is either a movie type of show or the news period i mean i don't 

169.15 171.49 A: i don't like sitcoms i don't 

171.62 173.40 A: so i guess i'm i don't know 

173.65 179.39 A: i'm sort of out of the normal as far as disliking television i guess to some extent 

180.38 182.59 B: uh-huh did you say you don't watch sitcoms either 

182.53 184.11 A: i don't no i don't 

184.14 186.46 B: ah interesting 

184.75 189.86 A: i mean my kids will you know but as far as i'm concerned 

191.51 192.76 A: and you know 

192.93 196.76 A: ev- even now at their age they're not interested in watching 

198.06 198.89 A: you know 

198.67 213.26 A: um any of these star search or any of these types of shows like that and i know i go to work i listen to people talking about it all the time and it's like i don't have a clue what the hell they're talking about but here again though i also don't watch 

202.84 204.24 B: (( oh really )) 

213.05 214.31 A: sports 

214.18 215.03 B: okay 

214.71 224.13 A: you know so i mean i'm like it i don't have anything particular on television that i find is all that you know 

224.87 233.75 A: and then of course even like i said you know the news that i do watch i'm pretty picky about who i'm watching it delivered by because they can be so damned biased you know 

234.12 235.62 A: (( so i mean that's )) 

236.27 238.10 A: whose whose m- you know 

239.84 241.67 B: okay well you know 

240.41 242.30 A: whose input do you believe 

242.27 244.05 B: well i 

244.54 258.65 B: i'm trying to think of why do i watch those shows so i watched um let's see i've i've watched the american idol and i've watched some of the dating shows um the ones that felt less phony to me and um 

259.01 261.67 B: i think i watch them for different reasons 

261.95 266.83 B: the american idol show i i liked it 'cause there was good singing and 

265.34 272.65 A: well okay but do you wish sort of do you sorta enjoy them or wish that you could be part of that or 

272.63 282.72 B: i i i it wouldn't be me myself but yeah i think part of the appeal is the the way they're presented that these are ordinary people that have gotten this big chance 

272.86 273.59 A: (( you know )) 

282.75 285.94 B: um yeah i think that does add to the interest 

285.31 294.71 A: yeah i mean that i i think that's a key why people may do that i mean years and years and years ago uh m. t. v. had that 

294.86 298.06 A: where the people all moved into the same house 

298.56 300.07 A: do you know what i'm talking about 

298.62 300.45 B: okay yeah i do 

300.32 303.58 A: i don't remember i've only seen a couple of shows of it 

303.74 310.35 A: but at one time that did sorta catch my interest but it never really went the way that you know 

310.36 314.08 A: i mean i thought it would go i mean i i was from a different world then 

314.34 317.86 A: anybody on t. v. type of thing they just don't have 

317.93 319.33 A: you know what i'm saying 

319.36 322.88 A: they just don't do that type of t. v. 

323.08 324.31 A: (( and it's )) 

324.79 327.86 A: i don't know i just never related to any of it i guess 

327.81 328.74 B: uh-huh 

328.66 335.45 A: yeah i think like what you were saying if you relate to it i think it it catches your interest 

334.42 335.41 B: (( ah okay )) 

335.53 336.45 A: (( i don't know )) 

337.14 340.04 A: i mean i just ah i just never saw 

343.70 346.16 A: i don't know [laughter] 

352.01 357.95 A: uh did you ever did you ever do anything like in entertainment or anything 

358.00 364.34 A: where like in a community center or something and and and and inspired to do something like that or 

364.24 368.93 B: no it's not something that i would do but um 

369.51 375.31 B: i i think there's still this idea that there's um ordinary um 

375.44 380.07 B: some ordinary person some young men or women and they've got this chance to 

381.23 382.57 B: suddenly 

382.74 390.51 B: win something that perhaps they wouldn't even have been dreaming of but to really jump ahead and actually i th- i think 

390.55 397.78 B: um that makes it more interesting than if it was someone who was already well established as a star who was up there 

398.21 399.22 B: um 

400.47 404.96 B: and another thing i find interesting about that show is you have judges who are 

404.99 406.06 B: (( um )) 

406.69 408.43 B: commenting within 

409.02 413.35 B: entertainment industry kinda perspective um 

413.59 427.03 B: on on these people singing and so they can talk about it from the point of view of marketing and image which is something i wouldn't have thought of but which is interesting to hear 

427.86 442.38 B: and it's also there's this aspect that if you're watching it you yourself are a judge 'cause you have your own opinions so it's interesting to compare your opinions to the judges' opinions and the the audience voting opinions 

442.25 446.44 A: do you do you have a circle of friends that that also 

446.71 447.54 A: you know 

447.73 454.28 A: like you can talk about it type of thing oh did you check out that show or did you see this one or that one type of thing 

454.05 463.29 B: you know i i i watch it alone but i probably do find it more interesting knowing that a lot of other people are watching it 

462.55 464.21 A: yeah see i don't like 

465.07 475.87 A: uh like i said i know i hear about it at work but i don't participate in it 'cause i don't find it you know and i don't have any knowledge about it either so i mean i guess on the other hand that's like 

467.17 468.04 B: (( yeah huh )) 

476.62 477.36 A: (( you know )) 

477.66 482.66 A: but here again the same thing with you know the guys have baseball and football pools and i don't 

482.95 483.85 B: okay 

483.41 489.21 A: i don't have a clue [laughter] you know what i'm saying yeah they say oh monday night who's playing this game i don't know [mn] 

489.80 491.23 A: (( you know )) 

492.44 493.00 B: (( [mn] )) 

493.89 498.59 A: so i guess i'm not really qualified to even be on this subject today 

499.25 503.38 A: [laughter] my daughter handed me the phone and said here dad wake up 

503.64 504.73 B: [laughter] 

504.92 510.03 A: 'cause i work third shift so i was just this is just about the time when i get up during the day 

509.91 511.09 B: [laughter] 

512.99 514.98 A: uh what do you do for work 

515.44 517.90 B: for work oh i'm a computer engineer 

517.60 518.76 A: oh okay 

518.83 530.79 A: but don't then you're sorta surrounded by you know people that would i think would you know you would hear that conversation type of thing at work more so i'm i'm a maintenance uh technician 

530.84 537.23 A: in a place pretty much well they make a lotta fire equipment one of the top named companies 

537.27 539.04 A: so i mean it's you know 

539.96 542.45 A: the cut of people are like you know 

544.89 548.29 A: i guess a little different i don't know you know what i'm saying 

546.06 547.96 B: but i 

547.98 550.42 B: i thought you said you did hear about it at work 

550.11 552.76 A: well yeah but i mean 

553.38 558.66 A: i don't know i don't like i said i don't really participate with that type of conversation 

558.86 562.77 A: so i don't know how much of it does actually go on but i do hear 

563.93 572.90 A: uh you know like the survivor series and stuff that sorta caught seemed to catch a lotta people's attention and stuff at work and you know um 

566.61 567.67 B: yeah 

571.66 572.46 B: uh-huh 

573.41 576.97 A: [lipsmack] oh what the other one that you were talking about 

576.97 578.24 B: american idol 

577.70 585.67 A: american idol no i would i would see it um like in some of the um uh you know my computer's 

587.66 599.89 A: um you know news services type of thing and who got thrown out or got busted for this or who did that and you know or who won in the end but i couldn't tell you anything about 

589.42 590.85 B: yeah okay
