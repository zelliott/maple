1.91 3.12 B: hello 

3.01 3.92 A: hello 

3.68 5.67 B: (( hi how ya doing )) 

5.59 7.34 A: (( all right what's your name )) 

7.15 8.27 B: lester 

8.47 9.39 A: lester 

9.16 10.15 B: yes 

9.83 11.38 A: hi my name's charles 

11.05 12.15 B: okay 

12.30 15.94 A: okay well uh what was the topic um 

16.66 19.62 B: i could just barely understand what she was saying 

19.23 24.22 A: yeah i think she said what do you think is worst and she gave a bunch of topics 

24.65 27.48 A: and i just heard gossiping and smoking 

27.94 31.55 A: and uh drinking and [mn] 

32.62 35.84 A: oh not exercising like which which do you think is 

36.02 38.33 A: like the worst i guess and why 

38.11 40.10 B: the worst 

39.45 40.21 A: yeah 

41.02 43.36 B: the worst would be drinking 

42.74 46.74 A: you think drinking they said drinking alcohol or excessive caffeine 

43.59 44.63 B: yeah 

47.07 48.18 A: (( that's what she said )) 

47.16 49.27 B: the alcohol 

48.67 50.70 A: (( drinking alcohol why do you think that [lipsmack] )) 

49.48 50.77 B: yeah 

51.04 54.86 B: that would be uh that would 'cause it deteriorates your mind so much 

55.38 57.11 A: okay that's true 

57.08 66.06 B: and uh also it takes and it affects your uh walking and your exercise altogether it just it ruins your whole life 

60.58 61.14 A: (( [cough] )) 

65.94 67.98 A: that's true that is true 

68.16 69.35 A: i uh 

69.73 79.11 A: well i mean if it's excessive drinking i guess i would say drinking as well but i'm not sure if she meant excessive drinking i thought i think she meant just drinking in general including alcohol in general 

73.29 75.18 B: right 

77.43 78.56 B: oh 

79.29 82.35 A: i think drinking alcohol in general is fine uh 

82.95 86.38 A: as long as it's you know not to an excessive point 

86.13 88.23 B: (( as long as you can control yourself )) 

88.23 95.99 A: as as long you can control yourself exactly well yeah exactly i mean i'm i'm pretty young so that's my mindset i don't know 

94.92 96.94 B: mhm 

96.16 98.28 A: i don't know how how old are you 

97.91 99.39 B: i'm fifty six 

99.24 105.97 A: fifty six okay i'm twenty two [laughter] so it's like a it's a different mind- yeah there's a little bit of difference i don't know i would say 

99.90 101.18 B: yeah 

102.47 104.02 B: there's a little bit of difference 

105.25 115.59 B: well moderation moderation in anything is good but as far as what we're talking about you know drinking in moderation um being able to handle or control it 

114.82 115.56 A: (( yep )) 

115.61 118.50 B: i think it's good 

115.63 116.45 A: sure 

117.08 118.31 A: (( yeah exactly )) 

118.72 120.51 A: excessiveness 

120.63 123.25 A: in anything like that is just not good 

122.85 125.14 B: right 

124.16 126.85 A: i don't know i would say um 

127.75 132.64 A: in that sense yeah drinking but if it's just regular i would say gossiping 

133.19 139.36 A: and again this is coming from a i guess a point of view but gossiping can uh 

139.75 143.81 A: mess things up a lot especially between people like i've seen it happen 

143.91 152.44 B: well yeah well gossiping can to my in my opinion is is not good period 

144.13 145.58 A: plenty of times 

148.65 149.21 A: (( [cough] )) 

151.97 153.14 A: okay yeah 

152.48 153.20 B: it's 

153.32 164.18 B: because if somebody can't defend themselves about whatever they said or do why should somebody else make the opinion on what they thought or what they did 

163.53 164.36 A: yeah 

164.77 169.94 A: and i don't know i don't see any real good in gossiping like gossip is just 

170.42 171.65 A: um 

171.66 176.89 A: you know one person talking about another person usually talking about another person 

177.09 184.40 A: uh in their own view you know not not necessarily the truth you know what i mean what good what good comes out of it and it's just spreading you know 

177.62 183.02 B: mhm 

184.63 185.61 A: just more 

185.71 187.06 A: things i guess 

187.26 188.74 A: so in that sense 

188.80 190.28 A: gossip is bad 

190.53 197.11 A: i don't know i think that's an interesting topic that she was speaking about i don't know they're all bad in their own way 

195.20 202.37 B: right well just like when we was talking about at the beginning anything anything in excessiveness is bad 

202.44 203.97 A: (( [cough] yeah yeah exactly )) 

203.12 204.05 B: (( you know )) 

204.47 212.79 B: but people's gonna gossip you can't stop that people's gonna drink you can't stop that people's gonna do drugs you can't stop that 

209.20 210.20 A: yeah 

211.83 213.12 A: that too yeah 

212.89 217.78 B: you know so everybody in general is gonna do basically what they want to right 

216.99 219.23 A: yep that's true that's true 

219.52 224.74 A: and i don't know i not what was the other one not exercising or something like that 

224.43 225.69 B: mhm 

224.98 225.97 A: well 

226.76 233.01 A: you know i don't think that's as bad that's not anywhere near nearly as bad as uh just the other ones 

232.35 236.34 B: well the other thing my opinion about exercise 

236.80 243.16 B: if you don't do enough of it your bones and your muscles and everything get soft 

243.35 244.94 A: yeah okay okay 

243.81 248.66 B: and then in the long term you have you have bad health 

248.64 249.83 A: right right 

249.85 250.87 B: you know 

250.06 252.34 A: well yeah i mean i i myself i 

252.37 259.47 A: you know exercise pretty much every other day i like workout at the gym so like i understand but 

259.25 261.36 B: do you do much walking 

259.78 267.69 A: right yeah i mean it's too a point where you have you know you have to at least be active in some way not just sit there and you know eat and 

263.97 268.65 B: right right 

267.86 268.92 A: just sit there 

268.95 270.98 A: you have to be moving at least but 

271.48 273.24 B: moving something anyway 

271.79 272.66 A: uh 

273.42 274.18 A: (( huh )) 

274.02 276.13 B: moving something anyway 

274.83 278.85 A: yeah moving something yeah yeah that's true that's true 

279.15 282.26 A: i don't know but and what was the other thing smoking 

282.49 284.16 A: smoking cigarettes so 

284.08 285.31 B: [mn] 

284.33 288.20 A: you know again excessiveness of that is just horrible too 

288.24 291.85 B: well my personal opinion about smoking is terrible 

291.75 292.69 A: okay 

292.41 295.54 B: i don't think anybody should smoke number one 

295.33 296.70 A: oh right right 

296.05 299.64 B: uh because of the lung damage that it causes 

299.63 300.78 A: mhm 

299.77 308.97 B: and then when you're in a group of people that that excessive smoke uh interferes with other people's lives 

308.81 310.25 A: yeah that's true 

309.67 324.05 B: if it's if it's done i think it should be done outside and then i think uh i don't know how you feel about it but i think if somebody's gonna smoke they shouldn't blow the smoke in the direction of your of wherever you're at when you're carrying on a conversation 

313.37 314.54 A: right 

322.14 323.05 A: yeah 

323.84 330.42 A: yeah well i mean second hand smoke also really affects people too so it's pretty much just as bad 

326.77 329.49 B: mhm 

329.51 330.96 B: do you smoke 

330.91 332.36 A: do i smoke no i don't 

331.92 332.86 B: (( oh )) 

332.37 338.00 A: actually i [cough] um well do you smoke at all no have you ever 

335.61 336.66 B: no 

337.79 338.71 B: no 

338.80 339.60 A: okay 

338.99 342.88 B: i did i smoked a pipe when i was about thirty years younger 

343.44 344.74 A: oh okay okay 

344.33 356.56 B: and uh but that was basic- i tried to do that in an o- area where there wasn't a lotta people confined like in a bar or a restaurant or something like that and uh 

353.03 354.13 A: (( all right )) 

355.21 357.72 A: yeah at least at least be courteous about it 

357.29 361.83 B: right my nasty habit is i drip tobacco 

357.91 359.39 A: yeah 

359.58 360.35 A: um 

362.50 366.07 A: oh you drip tobacco do you you do that right now or 

363.35 364.97 B: mhm 

365.41 368.28 B: (( mhm )) 

366.18 370.09 A: okay well i mean that just became an uh i guess an addiction in 

370.27 371.53 A: a sense right 

370.30 373.51 B: right it is it's a habit 

372.39 374.27 A: it's a habit yeah okay 

373.58 378.80 B: but my my opinion about that is it's it's a habit itself you know 

378.67 379.84 A: mhm 

379.19 392.79 B: if and you don't you don't take and interfere with anybody by dripping they just don't like to see that wad some of these people that carry a big wad in their upper lip you know or lower lip or on their jaw 

384.28 385.88 A: right right 

391.05 392.14 A: yeah
