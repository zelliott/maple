27.10 28.12 B: really 

28.41 33.54 A: yeah and it's like i don't know i guess the pollen count was extremely high this season 

28.90 30.23 B: yeah 

33.10 36.81 B: yeah ah have you ever had ah allergies before though 

37.11 40.25 A: no never this is the first time yeah 

37.87 38.70 B: really 

39.04 48.44 B: yeah yeah it used to be um when i was younger i would get ah i like in my teens i'd get sick in the beginning of the summer like a fever 

48.77 50.62 B: it'd last like a week or two 

51.13 55.71 B: but ah i haven't gotten sick at all for probably three or four years 

51.22 51.98 A: really 

55.94 57.47 B: and i'd be like a 

56.15 57.35 A: (( how old are you )) 

57.82 60.11 B: um i'm twenty eight 

60.54 61.51 A: twenty eight 

61.13 61.93 B: (( yeah how )) 

62.19 63.15 B: old are you 

62.20 63.19 A: (( oh okay )) 

63.69 65.45 A: ah twenty five 

64.96 68.81 B: twenty five yeah so yeah that's kind of odd that you had a 

69.54 73.23 B: the pollen count must have been really high for you to get allergies huh 

73.62 79.26 A: yeah actually um i i did look it up and they did say that ah this this season the pollen count was 

79.34 81.40 A: at it's highest in a long time 

80.72 81.77 B: wow 

81.78 90.34 A: and i think there was a sliding scale it's like there's a scale up to nine or or ten and this year was ah seven or eight 

87.15 88.02 B: uh-huh 

89.97 91.04 B: really 

91.16 91.94 A: yeah 

91.28 92.53 B: yeah my ah 

92.59 96.33 B: my wife ah didn't have allergies before ah 

96.46 99.38 B: she we had kids and after she ah 

99.73 102.63 B: had um had kids she's got allergies now 

102.90 108.28 B: that's kinda yeah that's kinda yeah she's been suffering quite a bit the past you know couple of weeks 

103.05 103.92 A: really 

108.78 110.88 A: (( what did you just have a kid recently )) 

110.55 115.74 B: um actually no we've had we have two kids ah one's ah five and the other's two 

116.41 117.19 A: (( ah )) 

116.45 119.51 B: and ah after the first one she started getting 

119.88 123.00 B: you know a little bit of allergies now they're pretty bad though 

123.62 130.33 B: so it's kinda odd how that you know after you have kids sometimes you can be allergic to things so 

130.14 132.12 A: yeah 

132.72 137.72 B: and ah what do you think wh- what was that saying that they were talking about if you go to the doctor 

138.22 139.23 B: (( ah )) 

139.24 140.55 A: seven days 

139.97 142.15 B: yeah and if you don't 

142.48 143.61 B: it'll be go- 

142.83 147.25 A: i i i couldn't get the rest of that all i heard is something about seven days 

145.02 146.23 B: yeah 

147.14 156.81 B: and i think they said something else about ah if you don't then it'll be over by week's end or something like that i think what they're saying is if yeah if you go to the doctor it'll 

153.56 154.94 A: oh i see 

156.87 159.46 B: [cough] last longer than if you don't 

160.43 164.28 B: i guess i kinda i kinda agree with that 

164.60 165.68 B: (( 'cause yeah )) 

164.86 168.29 A: what that if you go to the doctor your your symptoms might last longer 

168.05 171.30 B: it seems it always seems like when you go to the doctor you know they're 

171.79 173.88 B: (( they end you know )) 

174.08 176.60 B: longer it takes a little longer for it for 

176.77 178.04 B: you to heal 

178.33 179.41 B: maybe just 

178.70 179.93 A: that could be true 

179.61 183.86 B: and then if you just sit back and let the 

184.63 186.40 B: bug take its course 

187.55 190.26 A: yeah seems you lighten the wallet too [laughter] 

187.64 188.51 B: (( so [laughter] )) 

189.32 191.07 B: yeah definitely 

191.16 193.70 B: especially with doctor bills you know

222.15 223.70 B: like the pollen count 

224.02 228.77 B: or if it varies from you know region to region or if it's bad everywhere

283.89 288.47 B: in the winter you can get to like you know thirty below
