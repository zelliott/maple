306.29 307.55 A: we had a 

307.56 314.09 A: a humidifier going during the winter to put more moisture in the air which also helped 

310.53 311.92 B: (( [noise] )) 

313.95 315.44 B: right 

315.56 320.56 A: ah that that's one of the things that you really have to watch out for is 

315.90 316.88 B: yeah 

320.57 322.53 A: the amount of humidity 

323.17 325.98 A: that it doesn't get too low or too high 

327.06 328.47 B: yeah 

328.79 332.95 B: (( ah i completely agree actually i've used a humidifier ))

366.07 367.48 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

372.60 373.86 A: and um

388.85 390.08 A: so 

390.54 391.39 A: (( ah )) 

391.63 392.64 A: i just 

391.76 406.27 B: [mn] yeah i was actually i see that the sicknesses are definitely used to live in memphis tennessee and the humidity there is ridiculous it's near a hundred percent and the sicknesses were actually 

402.94 404.21 A: yes 

406.44 408.02 B: (( i guess )) 

408.22 417.54 B: a lot more down there like if something hit like a cold like ice storm a lot of people got sick 'cause they're not really used to it 

417.40 418.56 A: right 

417.58 420.81 B: so very it's very cold it's very wet 

420.72 426.02 A: once one february i came home i had been out in arizona 

420.82 422.11 B: cold 

426.47 428.62 A: ah at quartz site 

428.69 431.54 A: which is right near blythe california 

432.04 442.32 A: and ah w- when we came home the trees were all bent over and they could you could just see where they had cut it the limbs off 

436.93 438.10 B: yeah 

442.35 451.96 A: and let 'em drop by the side of the road they hadn't had time to pick 'em up or anything and it was like going through a tunnel with that ice storm 

448.20 449.19 B: mhm 

451.97 456.40 B: yeah yeah and um 

456.27 470.99 B: as for sicknesses during ice storms like just when it get it [mn] got cold down there just 'cause people weren't used to it they like new germs can live in the cold and things like that i mean like everybody everybody would be sick whereas up north 

463.03 464.07 A: mhm 

468.89 469.96 A: yeah 

470.87 477.57 B: less people get sick during the cold i think people are more ah i guess adapted to it ah 

476.67 477.62 A: well 

477.71 488.45 A: during the winter you're inside and if someone gets sick you get sick too sometimes i u- used to have you ever lived in the philadelphia area before 

482.96 486.13 B: right yeah so there's more illness there 

488.19 490.53 B: ah no no i haven't [mn] 

490.65 493.46 A: okay the summers are very sticky 

493.88 497.59 A: [laughter] not good news for you 

497.73 509.17 B: that's all right memphis was a hundred times a hundred percent humidity it wouldn't be raining it'd be ninety six degrees outside and be trying to play sports 

508.99 521.99 B: got kind of rough down there but it never did much get cold but ah i didn't really i got sick down there when i was young ah i'd moved from california to there and i got sick several times 

516.59 517.66 A: mhm 

522.52 536.98 B: and ah then after that i seemed to have adapted and then just you know i think as people move i think people also move during season changes 'cause i've been studying real estate ah people move 

537.09 538.85 A: yeah after sc- 

537.22 542.94 B: ah like or right yeah after spring or like right after ah

546.26 547.31 A: mhm 

557.71 559.20 A: yeah

565.02 567.09 B: much more likely to get sick 

566.52 570.98 A: yeah i think the cold wet weather kills off a lot of the 

567.42 567.98 B: (( [mn] ))
