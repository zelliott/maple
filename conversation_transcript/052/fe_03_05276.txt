32.69 34.32 B: [sigh] um

54.53 56.53 B: you know should we do it you know 

56.59 62.71 A: well this is my take at it um i don't think the u._s. should play the sort of police role 

62.54 63.44 B: yeah 

62.75 66.02 A: um in in a foreign nation policy 

66.36 77.96 A: uh i don't think it should be i don't think it's our it's our job to necessarily go into another country and say let's see your weapons when we're being hypocritical and we have weapons longer range than that in the first place 

77.79 78.81 B: yes 

78.71 83.19 A: you um you know if they're going to say you know you can't have these weapons then we shouldn't have them either 

83.34 85.88 B: [lipsmack] yes i agree [lipsmack] 

85.63 87.43 A: (( so i uh saddam )) 

86.09 90.95 B: but the united states is a superpower and so they they they figure that 

88.63 92.41 A: yes they are so they might have to take on the superpower role 

91.83 93.62 B: yeah 

93.08 96.81 A: see i i agree with you on that they are the superpower and uh 

95.77 96.71 B: mhm 

96.95 105.94 A: a lot and lot of countries depend on our country to be fully functional and working to its prime and if we see a threat to a country like saddam hussein in iraq 

101.76 102.74 B: yes 

106.03 112.76 A: then the whole world cannot let uh you know our united states go downhill 

112.38 113.63 B: mhm 

112.97 116.01 A: (( we're going to have to eliminate the threat )) 

115.57 116.56 B: yes 

116.89 120.75 A: so i don't know i you know i go both siding on it but 

120.86 128.17 B: [lipsmack] well that's just like terrorism in united states you know i was way shocked over the twin towers 

121.75 122.92 A: (( [mn] that it )) 

128.28 131.29 B: you know i was way shocked and i still 

130.36 131.82 A: (( happened )) 

131.58 145.34 B: yes and i still i still don't believe that only five thousand people lost their lives i bet it was a lot more than that you know those are those are the like the tallest fucking buildings 

140.35 141.73 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

143.64 145.64 A: oh they're extremely busy

172.55 173.50 A: okay

173.79 176.17 A: (( so let's say thirty thousand just approx )) 

175.05 181.57 B: i would say yes probably thirty thousand people died but they don't want to let us know that that many people died 

181.83 188.14 A: why because they don't want to they don't want uh us to think that this terrorism really did impact us that much and 

187.54 189.67 B: yes yes
