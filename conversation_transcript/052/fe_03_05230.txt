57.56 61.93 A: because that's ah generally i only get sick when the seasons change like from ah 

61.80 66.93 A: i- it happens a lot mostly from when the winter the cold weather changes into warm weather 

66.70 76.91 A: ah my body i guess just has a hard time adapting to that so i that's a that's a problem for me i know personally 'cause i get i get the flu and stuff like that happens commonly 

72.56 73.46 B: (( oh )) 

76.75 78.26 B: no kidding
