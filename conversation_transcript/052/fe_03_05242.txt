85.49 91.53 A: yeah well after my left lung collapsed i figured it was time to stop 

90.39 93.65 B: uh that would be a good hint i think 

93.10 102.06 A: sure i you know i ignored it after the when the right one collapsed but when the left one went too i said nah maybe it's time to quit [mn] 

101.40 103.46 B: well i hope your health is okay right now ah 

103.08 106.22 A: oh yeah i'm healthy as a horse except i can't breathe 

106.32 110.94 B: a small detail [lipsmack] uh let's see 

107.85 109.41 A: (( yeah )) 

112.33 114.31 B: which one would you pick on the list 

114.53 118.02 A: as what i would consider the worst habit of all 

117.01 118.39 B: yeah 

120.02 123.08 A: probably drinking too much 

123.17 124.73 B: okay 

124.94 128.75 B: i don't know that i got you know although i'm a smoker i think it's a pretty bad habit 

128.25 130.81 A: right but you're basically not 

131.09 133.44 A: killing anybody but yourself 

133.64 137.57 B: well they'd be those that would argue about second hand smoke 

135.74 138.34 A: well that's that's that's in dispute 

138.82 140.43 B: uh 

140.23 145.15 A: but i mean you drink too much get behind the wheel of a car and go you're 

146.68 148.54 B: yeah that can be pretty lethal 

148.01 149.49 A: that's lethal 

149.89 153.67 B: too much caffeine not eating okay well you know 

153.81 162.00 B: from a viewpoint of too much alcohol if you wanna talk about all of the social consequences associated with that to others then i think you're 

162.17 167.67 B: i'd i'd put alcohol up there as number one or number two because of you know the drunk driving sort of thing 

165.02 165.83 A: (( oh )) 

168.43 170.57 B: smoking i mean is offensive 

169.54 172.48 A: smoking is up there as one or two too 

171.17 173.76 B: yeah smoking is offensive to others 

173.21 173.77 A: (( [cough] )) 

173.91 175.04 A: well 

174.02 176.31 B: and it can be a pretty dirty habit 

175.90 177.08 A: yes 

176.40 179.11 B: and you can get ashes all over everything 

178.59 180.00 A: right 

179.17 181.61 B: and cigarette burns in stuff 

181.23 192.83 A: oh yeah i've gotten i've gone through enough couches and and tables and car seats and stuff to say yeah that's not good 

192.35 201.36 B: yeah okay so gossiping we we we agree is not too terribly bad not as bad as smoking or alcohol ov- overeating [mn] 

199.52 200.33 A: and 

201.59 209.66 A: well you know what they're saying i i was surprised that obesity is starting to edge out smoking as the number one health 

209.39 210.44 B: concern 

210.06 212.54 A: concern [laughter] of the country 

212.64 216.42 A: that more more money more health money is being uh 

216.69 218.71 A: spent on the 

218.85 224.64 A: consequences of overeating than than on the consequences of smoking 

225.38 226.36 B: okay 

225.73 227.68 A: interesting but 

227.16 241.45 B: yeah well the the whole concept of people being americans getting more and more weight and and there've there've been a couple of well more than a couple but just the whole uh m- much ado in the in the in the popular press 

240.78 242.39 A: mhm 

241.64 246.64 B: about overeating and how it's becoming overweight is becoming an epidemic 

246.77 249.41 B: and the health consequences of overeating 

249.04 256.86 A: right and you know and the only thing i was saying is i just read recently that the health consequences of obesity are starting to 

256.90 259.91 A: overshadow the health consequences of smoking 

259.29 269.19 B: yeah yeah well you know i think i think it's too bad that they're gonna l- they've lost the suit against mcdonalds [laughter] 

265.03 274.87 A: [mn] [laughter] i you know to be perfectly honest i think that was a piece of nonsense anyhow how can ya 

275.91 286.97 B: well they weren't well they're they're taking they're taking uh they whoever they are uh the lawyers the lawyers are basically uh taking a a page out of the smokers book 

280.20 282.89 A: they are the people we don't like right 

286.61 287.67 A: right 

287.08 298.36 B: in terms of saying you know you didn't adequately inform the public about the dangers of you know how how much fat was in your stuff and therefore you've caused these health problems i mean you know smokers are collecting pretty significant damages 

298.17 303.17 A: well most of yeah you're not a lawyer are ya [mn] 

302.57 311.27 B: no [laughter] although my father was but he was not uh yeah uh he was a corporate lawyer rather than a rather than a trial lawyer sort of thing

433.74 436.95 B: oh that's been in the press in philly these days 

436.38 440.82 A: yes there's apparently a been a rash of them

510.60 511.76 A: but uh 

512.93 518.35 A: yeah i if if we have to reach a decision here i think probably the the uh 

519.05 523.54 A: the worst habit is probably smoking sorry on- only b- 

521.20 527.70 B: okay yeah well no no no well you know you are a former smoker so i mean at least you've broken the bad habit 

527.10 530.39 A: yeah it took me about five years to do it 

529.49 532.81 B: did you uh do any of the nicotine gums or any of those things 

532.00 539.93 A: i used the gums i i used everything and it was finally just the gums that that got me out 

533.61 534.71 B: and 

539.61 542.80 B: well they t- they taste so terrible i've had some of 'em 

542.27 543.23 A: right 

542.87 547.24 B: and i take it you did did you have to uh was it more than one attempt was it three or four 

546.26 548.75 A: oh three four five 

548.45 553.85 B: okay and you get on the wagon again and fall off and then decide to restart 

553.64 560.80 A: yeah i mean it was and i always found every time it was the hardest time in it was about three months in 

559.28 559.84 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

560.80 563.65 B: yeah yeah 

561.81 566.05 A: yeah give up for like three months and then all of a sudden [laughter]

571.30 572.69 A: mhm 

571.83 574.42 B: three weeks and three months 

574.04 575.23 A: oh really 

574.64 578.81 B: now i know that the three days is when the nicotine finally clears your system 

579.18 580.59 A: oh do you 

580.69 589.96 A: i don't believe that [laughter] no 'cause i've i've i've tried to cold turkey and after three days all somebody would have to do is walk by me 

581.99 585.21 B: well you still have a dependency on it 

589.92 591.56 B: and you'd smell it and 

590.70 595.44 A: and it's i'd smell it and i just wanted one so bad
