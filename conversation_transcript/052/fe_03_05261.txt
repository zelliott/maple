544.58 546.40 B: mhm 

545.27 554.16 A: like it's not a series then like it's pretty much all about like just how attractive they are but you can't follow their personality or character just in an hour you know 

547.36 548.49 B: yeah 

553.90 555.32 B: right that's true 

555.30 559.31 A: (( but if it's like a series then it's more like you gotta enter their personality ))
