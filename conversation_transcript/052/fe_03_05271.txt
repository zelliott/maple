49.39 50.40 B: (( ya )) 

51.07 54.53 A: okay what do you think about disarming iraq 

54.77 56.51 B: [noise] about disarming iraq 

56.62 58.08 B: we already did [mn] 

59.17 61.09 B: i think we already did didn't we 

61.48 63.11 A: no i don't think so 

63.39 64.44 B: (( how do you mean )) 

65.11 70.07 A: well i think there there are still a lot of terrorist groups there 

69.74 72.62 B: [mn] oh that's what they mean by disarming [mn] 

72.64 75.66 B: you mean civil unrest and yeah 

72.92 79.68 A: that's what i thought yeah that's what i just had a lot of terrorist groups still there i think just the other 

82.87 86.39 A: i think just the other day they found a lot of terrorist camps 

87.65 89.70 B: they could have had a hundred of 'em yesterday 

89.86 102.29 A: yeah and then they have the weapons of mass destruction i still think they have those too and i think that we'll find 'em some day yeah what do you think 

98.18 99.24 B: really 

101.44 103.80 B: i don't think there are weapons of mass destruction 

103.93 105.31 A: why don't you think so 

104.02 107.74 B: i think it was a i think it was just well we could have found them by now 

108.35 111.91 B: you know if there's radioactivity it's pretty easy to find a 

112.16 114.81 B: to do a scanner for radioactivity 

114.98 120.40 A: yeah there's a lot of chemical weapons though that you wouldn't be able to find out biological weapons 

121.14 130.45 A: i mean you have a a country the size of california it'd be like trying to find that in california just take forever 

130.37 136.12 B: well i would say in that case our intelligence is severely lacking to the point of being morons 

136.63 137.83 A: you think so 

137.58 141.47 B: yeah 'cause we have what hundreds of those people in in ah capture 

141.57 145.95 B: you don't think they could point down one or two ah places where they think they had ah 

146.63 149.03 B: some kind of ah storage for that kind of stuff 

149.43 156.15 A: well it's like well that that might be true but then i think about why they have all those chemical biological weapons too 

159.09 160.77 B: why they have them 

160.52 170.55 A: yeah exactly they have them they just they yeah they found a lot of that ah when they first operation iraqi freedom when it first started 

161.83 163.84 B: i don't even know that they do have them 

169.78 172.28 B: oh i heard the brits sold them to them 

172.56 175.64 A: oh really 

173.27 175.87 B: maybe they were afraid of chemical attacks themselves 

176.77 178.27 A: (( yeah i don't know )) 

178.56 184.49 A: i just think that saddam is such a sly guy i'm sure he has stuff hidden away 

186.87 187.75 B: (( saddam )) 

188.35 190.31 A: saddam hussain 

190.06 191.24 B: yeah 

191.24 192.84 A: yeah 

192.03 198.57 B: oh i think we went in there ah on the rationalization for ah weapons of mass destruction but the real reason was because we wanted the oil 

199.62 202.65 A: i i don't think that's true 

202.67 214.86 A: i think that i think that maybe if it's not the real reason is the weapons of mass destruction the only thing is we want saddam out of power because he is funding all the terrorist groups 

215.85 219.74 B: well there was a report in the newspaper this week that he had no connection with them 

219.81 223.30 A: oh really i don't i just don't buy that 

223.44 236.64 A: i i would be a hundred percent sure that he has connections with those people i mean it with all the training camps that they had in his country he's such a militant guy 

229.50 230.94 B: based on what facts 

236.54 239.46 A: (( you would have to know that they have these )) 

240.13 242.04 A: they have these camps for 

244.08 244.88 B: huh 

245.69 250.78 A: that yeah so what do you think we should do instead 

250.42 253.09 B: interesting instead i think we should take the oil fields 

253.98 257.24 A: take the oil fields for how do you 

257.24 259.02 B: to support our ah 

259.12 262.26 B: our economy which is going to take a downturn in a couple of years' time 

262.79 264.49 A: mean do what i'm sorry i 

265.07 269.04 B: to support our economy which is going to take a downturn in a couple of years' time 

265.36 266.04 A: (( say it )) 

267.11 275.58 A: again yeah so you think we should take all their oil for 

272.84 275.46 B: well it's it's ours by now by um 

275.85 277.24 B: by right 

276.22 280.61 A: that yeah because we bailed them out you 

280.78 283.63 B: well we've taken over the country i mean that's just a classic 

281.87 293.02 A: mean yeah do you think that we helped the people over there 

283.78 285.20 B: form of ah 

285.29 286.91 B: of imperialism 

291.56 299.89 B: um i don't know i think they're baking in a hundred and twenty degrees heat right now and they're not very happy with it if you ask them i guess that's the important question 

299.95 302.05 B: for the most part they're not happy with us 

300.02 301.61 A: yeah 

302.22 303.76 A: you don't think so 

303.40 306.33 B: [cough] they have no electricity and won't have electricity for the next ah 

307.23 312.79 B: what is it three months or a year i can't remember there's some time they're gonna be without juice 

310.32 311.55 A: (( yeah i don't know )) 

313.24 315.11 A: yeah 

314.81 317.31 B: so what we're getting into huh 

315.33 318.78 A: (( how about what's that )) 

318.29 322.65 B: what we're getting in in terms of news coverage does not reflect apparently what's going on there 

323.44 325.42 A: yeah not if yeah that's true 

326.21 327.40 A: just depends 

327.94 331.87 A: i think they're better off without saddam i mean how 

330.75 334.12 B: [mn] well yeah there's no doubt about that he was a scoundrel 

334.04 338.20 A: yeah where are you originally from 

337.55 339.28 B: i'm from dear old england 

339.49 341.54 A: oh really 

340.42 342.12 B: mhm 

341.61 346.98 A: so what did how did you feel about the english going in and helping out the americans 

346.45 347.64 B: i think it's great 

348.23 351.00 A: yeah you supported that 

349.00 349.76 B: yeah 

350.47 351.32 B: huh 

351.32 354.58 A: you were in support of that 

353.42 357.16 B: well in so far that it was going to happen and it was going to be inevitable sure 

357.09 358.03 A: (( ahah )) 

357.54 362.30 B: i'm not so sure we did the right thing to begin with and i'm not sure i'm i'm pretty sure went for all the right reasons 

362.32 366.09 B: and that's the question about weapons of mass destruction again i don't think there ever were any 

366.33 368.12 A: yeah 

366.58 371.22 B: i th- ah there's i there's plenty of room for the intelligence people our intelligence people 

371.38 375.44 B: to bring in experts quote unquote experts from ah iraq 

375.64 378.25 B: who are fleeing the coun- country quote unquote 

378.28 380.09 A: yeah 

378.63 383.45 B: who are who are are basically in the service of the united states as agents 

383.66 388.02 B: and they'll give their their story to support our theories and probabilities 

383.91 385.95 A: yeah 

388.27 389.96 A: yeah 

388.83 393.02 B: there's plenty of room for that that's just that's just common sense in terms of covert action 

393.35 396.18 A: so would you have wanted more talking 

397.07 399.53 B: no i d- you know i'm not ah 

399.79 404.49 B: i'm not against what happened i just think that we're being sold a bill of goods in terms of 

404.89 406.34 B: the rationale for it 

407.38 408.49 B: um 

409.65 414.82 A: i think that happens with anything though any type of war there's a little bit of you know 

415.26 416.25 A: ah 

417.29 420.82 A: (( what's it called propaganda )) 

420.83 430.78 A: (( with anything ah from from both sides yeah )) 

422.15 423.14 B: right 

426.87 427.73 B: yeah 

427.78 434.91 B: but ah i think it's it's a form of brainwashing and and i don't like as an american to be brainwashed by my own government i mean we stand for freedom 

435.62 438.82 B: um let's not try and pull the wool over our own people 

439.69 445.83 B: does our government really know that they're doing the best thing i think in this case they might i don't think it's always going to be that way though 

446.40 448.24 A: yeah 

447.48 451.12 B: i'm not in favor of paying more taxes for higher security for what 

451.94 453.75 A: for our country 

452.97 454.13 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

454.29 456.97 A: (( oh you're not in favor of that )) 

455.91 456.95 B: no 

457.36 459.33 A: why not 

457.57 461.78 B: mainly well because once it's there it's never going to go away it's another tax 

462.43 467.57 A: yeah but don't you think that our security is really important 

463.59 465.04 B: and you know i mean 

467.21 477.25 B: it's very important and i think that we're right to protect it but i don't think that they're that we're doing it the right way and i think there's an overkill and a psychological brainwashing that goes along with it which i'm not comfortable with 

477.59 481.66 A: what do you think would be a better way to protect our security 

481.39 488.42 B: well right now i would drop all the guards i would i would revert to the pre nine eleven security that we had i would just cancel everything 

488.53 492.40 B: and say you know what this really is a free country go ahead and try it again 

493.09 495.58 B: we got your oil go ahead and try it again 

496.52 498.85 A: yeah what do you think that'll do 

499.49 501.01 B: i think um [mn] 

502.03 508.67 B: i think it would it would encourage us if we were serious about it to spend more money on intelligence and have real intelligence 

509.01 509.89 A: (( ahah )) 

511.06 512.53 B: rather than ah 

513.09 524.75 B: rather than just put up a wall rather than ah you know having more more personnel ah being paid five five dollars and seventy five cents an hour to to secure this country or whatever it is 

524.99 526.02 B: um 

527.13 530.27 B: i just think it would be a free country and that's what that's what we're here for 

530.68 537.34 A: yeah well you what would you say then if we had another big attack and 

537.14 541.49 B: i'd say i'd say use our intelligence to find who it is and bomb them out of existence 

542.33 544.08 A: (( what )) 

543.21 544.95 B: bomb them out of existence 

545.40 547.69 A: yeah so you're not 

545.83 549.91 B: the message the message has to go out that you cannot get away with it 

549.88 551.37 A: yeah 

550.28 557.71 B: the fact that there are crazy people in the world is something we're gonna live with and you know one way or another we're gonna control it i just think the way we're controlling it is the wrong way 

558.12 563.05 A: yeah but if we can gather intelligence and then protect ourselves as best we can 

563.50 567.94 A: and then hopefully ward off another attack like that 

570.61 572.32 B: (( [mn] [mn] well that's wishful thinking [mn] )) 

573.16 574.81 A: yeah 

573.39 575.77 B: i think i think we're gonna get another attack anyway 

576.31 580.53 A: (( yeah i don't know i hope not )) 

581.40 585.47 A: hope not how long does this thing last 

584.61 586.65 B: (( [mn] [laughter] have you had enough )) 

586.88 589.55 A: well i thought it would last ten minutes 

589.71 591.48 B: yeah you've probably been on five 

592.24 594.18 A: oh really my timer s- 

593.08 594.06 B: i'm not 

594.22 596.31 A: my timer says twelve minutes now 

596.41 597.45 B: oh really 

597.52 598.53 A: yeah 

598.71 599.89 B: (( how did who go who ))
