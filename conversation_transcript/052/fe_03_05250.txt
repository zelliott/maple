12.88 15.50 B: what was the uh uh today's topic 

14.02 19.63 A: [laughter] she kinda ran through like five topics really quickly 

19.12 21.53 B: yeah i couldn't really hear 

20.01 21.04 A: it was 

21.43 27.00 A: what what was uh the worst thing to do gossiping 

26.52 29.26 B: oh not exercising and smoking 

27.97 31.70 A: not exercising overeating smoking 

31.63 34.38 B: (( hm )) 

31.73 32.99 A: drinking 

33.28 36.80 A: uh alcohol or caffeine 

37.63 40.33 A: i think was about it 

39.80 42.43 B: well to me it all 

42.44 50.31 B: i think it all depends on the person like if the person's already overweight then you know they really shouldn't be eating 

47.29 48.25 A: uh-huh 

50.79 55.57 B: and if the person is like if they have asthma then they shouldn't be smoking 

55.60 60.00 B: well i i suppose that alcohol would be the best outta all of those 

59.54 60.81 A: yeah 

60.77 61.63 B: (( yeah )) 

60.82 65.10 A: what were the other ones [laughter] oh you know um 

65.52 74.79 A: you gotta point there because it is different with everybody i think because you you know different people have different bodies that react to different things in different ways 

69.30 70.29 B: yeah 

74.35 75.56 B: yeah 

75.00 77.49 A: and there's some people that can't drink at all 

77.14 78.57 B: mhm 

77.94 82.37 A: and there's other people that can't that shouldn't be smoking that do 

83.07 83.95 B: (( mm )) 

84.16 89.48 A: i have an uncle that uh he lost a leg because his circulation was so bad 

89.17 90.48 B: (( oh man )) 

89.58 90.84 A: from uh 

90.87 97.12 A: smoking cigarettes and he was the type that you know should never ever smoke and then 

97.22 101.09 A: man he got outta the hospital and started right back up again 

101.67 109.94 A: then he had a heart attack and then the doctor told him he was gonna cut his other leg off if he didn't quit finally that's what it took you know 

101.68 102.68 B: oh 

107.35 108.44 B: (( oh )) 

109.90 110.93 B: man 

110.34 112.54 A: so in his situation 

113.00 116.91 A: i think that uh you know smoking is definitely 

117.21 118.94 A: definitely wrong now 

119.05 127.51 A: as far as eating i know people that can eat like you know tons and tons of food and not gain any weight [laughter] 

123.90 125.64 B: and not gain any weight 

125.90 129.44 B: yeah that's just like my sister she'll eat and eat 

129.54 132.40 B: and she she she won't get any bigger 

132.28 144.27 A: oh i have a neighbor like that he comes over here and orders food and he just woofs it and eats so fast too i mean if you turn and blink his plate is empty and then uh 

134.51 135.97 B: [laughter] 

144.44 146.45 B: (( mm )) 

144.57 146.73 A: he doesn't he's he's skinny 

146.90 151.14 A: but if i do the same thing i i gotta watch what i eat because uh 

151.30 153.51 A: if i don't man [laughter] 

152.75 153.99 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

153.58 155.33 A: it'll go right on me 

155.94 157.01 A: but 

157.28 164.59 A: yeah i i think eating is not well i guess if you're a a you know a compulsive binge eater 

165.28 171.67 A: and you have like high cholesterol or high blood pressure something like that then you know it is a 

168.42 169.40 B: uh-huh 

172.26 175.63 A: it is a bad i think all of those things that they mentioned it 

175.86 177.41 A: really depends 

177.11 179.38 B: yeah it varies 

179.32 182.66 A: and even like with uh the caffeine

216.10 218.66 A: it doesn't disgust me or anything 

218.96 221.01 A: because i don't think you know they don't 

221.39 227.82 A: they they might get a little agitated or you know a little nervous or something like that but but they don't go 

223.60 224.58 B: (( yeah )) 

227.97 232.16 A: you know like if somebody's binge drinking for instance 

232.46 234.85 A: you know and they go off on you or they 

234.99 241.86 A: can't control themselves when you take 'em some place and they embarrass you or something like that that doesn't 

236.36 237.54 B: yeah 

240.68 243.12 B: some people have that problem 

242.54 245.26 A: yeah that doesn't happen with with uh 

245.69 247.06 A: drinking coffee 

248.29 254.72 A: and uh you know smoking is is like a uh individual individual choice 

248.44 249.19 B: [noise] 

254.87 255.66 B: mm 

255.76 263.80 A: as far as gossiping i think everybody gossips [laughter] you know i don't know anybody that that doesn't and they say that uh

266.01 274.19 A: that that people say women gossip all the time but men gossip just just as much but just about different things you know different topics 

266.16 266.89 B: (( mhm )) 

272.05 273.50 B: yeah 

273.63 277.25 B: women can gossip and go on and on 

276.70 278.81 A: [laughter] 

278.02 285.81 B: i mean i've learned the hard way i mean if you have no choice but to sit and listen to what females talk about its horror 

283.45 284.31 A: (( mm )) 

285.71 288.72 A: oh yeah you mean among themselves 

286.31 288.20 B: i mean it's just like 

289.03 298.21 B: you would not believe what women talk about when there are no guys around or some of 'em they just don't care they talk about bizarre things 

297.72 299.46 A: [laughter] like what 

299.64 301.30 B: [noise] oh can you excuse me for 

302.21 306.36 B: and women they can go on and on about talking about things man 

306.06 310.02 A: oh i know especially if they're talking about somebody they don't like 

307.13 308.10 B: i mean 

309.42 310.68 B: of course 

310.22 312.55 A: [laughter] 

311.25 314.65 B: (( mhm [noise] yeah )) 

313.93 318.18 A: and they have to convince somebody else that it's something that they don't like 

317.68 318.66 B: mhm 

318.64 323.47 A: yep i've been in that position too where i'm the one that they're gossiping to 

322.84 324.34 B: [laughter] 

323.71 327.38 A: and i don't necessarily wanna hear it you know but uh 

326.07 327.02 B: (( yeah )) 

327.39 340.17 A: there's not a quick exit i can make or anything [laughter] that's that's gonna get me out of it so i just kinda just bear and usually what i do i can go into this little 

329.23 332.48 B: [laughter] 

340.54 342.74 A: trance like state 

342.09 343.63 B: [laughter] 

342.90 345.33 A: where it just goes in one ear 

344.91 346.62 B: and goes out the other 

345.58 354.22 A: and goes out the other but inevitably after a while they're gonna say and what did i just say or [laughter] were you listening to me 

351.28 352.84 B: and you just like 

353.77 355.60 B: [laughter] 

355.01 362.41 A: and i'm like going yeah yeah yeah well what did i just say well you were talking about uh yeah [laughter] 

360.40 362.04 B: [laughter] 

363.29 366.08 A: but yeah that happens to me all the time 

363.54 364.66 B: yeah 

365.51 371.49 B: and if there's a room of females talking before you walk in and as soon as you walk in they stop you know they're talking about you 

370.88 372.94 A: oh yeah well that happens 

371.73 374.30 B: i've had that happen plenty of times 

373.68 375.18 A: all the time 

374.59 380.65 B: i'll be outside of a room and you hear a bunch of laughing and talking and as soon as you walk in it's just dead ssilence 

380.24 383.16 A: and it's like what's going on oh nothing 

383.22 385.55 A: [laughter] 

384.86 389.65 B: [laughter] don't mind me keep on talking you know that's okay you're here now you know 

390.67 392.31 A: yeah because uh 

390.72 391.97 B: oh man yeah 

392.89 394.04 A: women 

393.89 395.62 B: (( [laughter] mhm mm )) 

394.17 395.74 A: they like to 

396.51 398.44 A: go into detail 

398.08 399.32 B: yeah 

398.77 403.23 A: sometimes get into detail and then they go off on a little tangent 

403.21 403.83 B: (( uh-huh )) 

403.53 416.84 A: and they wind up completely in a different place than where they started out and maybe you wanted to hear about what they started out talking about but by the time they wind up you know with it especially when they're talking about people at their job 

407.40 408.63 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

417.22 418.85 B: mhm 

418.42 419.35 A: (( [mn] )) 

420.14 421.77 A: but 

421.88 424.66 A: yeah i guess you know gossiping can be 

425.38 427.16 A: can be bad if 

427.51 434.39 A: 'cause a lot of stuff they'll say is just because they don't like somebody and they're trying to influence somebody else 

431.17 432.31 B: (( yeah mhm [laughter] )) 

434.58 436.42 A: not to like that person 

437.04 438.55 A: so maybe 

438.66 444.62 A: you know the person that they're gossiping about it might not be all that bad 

440.95 452.66 B: hm 

444.64 451.34 A: but they're gonna you know embellish it and you know just make it sound like that's the worst thing that person 

452.04 458.27 A: you know that that person is just like the worst person around and the other thing is the uh 

459.10 463.63 A: the uh person they're talking to probably don't even wanna hear it you 

464.34 477.29 A: know that that happens to me a lot see i work around a lotta women [laughter] so i get i get that treatment all the time where you know like you were saying you walk in and they're 

477.55 482.49 A: they're either you know real quiet or they give you like a look like you know 

482.76 486.51 A: what are you doing here i walk in and i'll just turn around and walk out 

486.56 489.25 A: just let them go ahead and say what they wanna say 

489.77 498.97 B: no matter how many years go by we will never understand women they're just like a human enigma i mean it's it's a mystery it's it's 

493.90 494.92 A: (( mm )) 

498.28 499.78 A: it is a mystery 

500.20 506.23 A: because you know they they um and when you right when you think you've got it figured out 

505.62 508.92 B: mhm they they just do something to change your mind 

506.57 510.20 A: (( [laughter] they switch off on you )) 

511.43 511.99 B: (( yeah )) 

511.98 515.03 A: that is so true you know it's uh 

513.35 514.44 B: (( mhm )) 

515.17 517.09 A: it's something that you can never 

517.42 524.59 A: really uh predict you know they're not as predictable i'm pretty predictable i think you know 

522.71 523.49 B: (( yeah )) 

524.67 526.27 A: basically 

526.41 527.78 A: but uh 

528.23 532.36 A: yeah when i come to work i know what my job is know what i gotta do 

532.75 535.81 A: you know i get through it but um 

536.30 540.49 A: it's like you say the the gossiping especially around jobs 

540.36 541.56 B: yeah 

540.99 546.69 A: if they hire somebody new or something and some of these women don't like 'em 

544.46 545.40 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

547.02 550.31 A: or if you're the new person everybody's gonna gossip 

550.00 551.49 B: (( mhm you get you )) 

550.66 552.10 A: and and the 

551.50 554.27 B: walk in get all the stares and 

553.68 559.26 A: mhm well the women kinda gossip to the people who have already been there to see what they think of that person 

558.93 560.13 B: yeah

570.17 571.08 B: (( you know )) 

571.13 580.30 B: women have they they have this ability where they can they can speak with their friends they they can talk to other females without even moving their mouth they can just look at 'em 

579.69 581.75 A: oh yeah mhm 

580.58 582.58 B: and then they'll know what they're talking about 

582.03 587.36 A: [laughter] they they give 'em that look and then the other one will give 'em that nod like yep 

586.61 587.76 B: yeah 

587.81 592.13 B: and you'll be sitting there looking dumbfounded like uh 

592.22 595.62 B: and one looks at the other like ah okay
