11.53 12.75 A: green 

14.29 15.89 A: you're right um 

15.02 17.71 B: [laughter] it's right outside of philadelphia actually 

17.24 18.28 A: (( oh okay )) 

18.28 20.23 B: not far from the university 

19.86 23.95 A: okay well great have you participated in one of these before 

23.30 25.01 B: uh no this is my first time 

24.63 26.32 A: same [laughter] same here so 

25.83 27.94 B: right that's good [laughter] 

27.69 31.24 A: so as i understand how did you find out about it just through a search on the web or 

31.01 35.25 B: actually uh i was visiting this site it's called two plus two dot com 

35.02 36.36 A: right 

35.45 37.05 B: it's like a poker site 

36.84 37.85 A: okay 

37.06 39.26 B: and someone had like a thing up there for it 

39.15 40.06 A: okay 

40.42 42.95 B: so i was like why not ten dollars 

40.54 41.42 A: yeah 

42.79 48.66 A: yeah exactly well as i understand this basically we're just supposed to talk about bioterrorism 

43.34 44.52 B: yeah 

48.37 49.68 B: yeah i guess so 

50.61 53.95 A: and uh is this being recorded do you know or 

53.28 56.77 B: yeah i think it's being recorded for ten minutes we just talk for ten minutes 

55.71 56.50 A: okay 

56.73 57.71 A: okay 

57.21 60.43 B: and then they like i don't know give us money or something 

60.16 61.05 A: okay 

61.09 62.86 A: well i 

61.97 69.54 B: uh what do you think of it i i think we're supposed to talk about like what the u._s. can do like i guess to either prevent it or 

64.02 64.97 A: well i [noise] 

70.66 73.11 B: stop it i guess before it happens 

71.93 73.08 A: mhm 

73.69 76.42 B: uh do you have like an opinion on the matter 

76.33 80.08 A: well yes i do is there another participant on the line 

80.01 81.62 B: uh i think it's just us two 

81.89 83.46 A: (( okay i thought i heard someone hello )) 

83.48 84.24 B: (( oh )) 

84.14 91.17 A: okay um yeah as far as just yes i do have an opinion on it probably fairly strong and that 

91.47 95.77 A: is uh i i do believe that we what we have done 

96.38 99.14 A: in the last two years 

99.18 104.27 A: is a good indication that we probably were too weak in our intelligence gathering 

104.35 107.32 A: but have done a fairly decent job 

107.78 108.96 A: (( in )) 

109.58 113.26 A: improving the intelligent gathering that was necessary to uh 

113.54 119.10 A: um i guess pick up on potentials of bioterrorism and terrorism itself 

119.39 120.54 A: um 

121.42 128.89 A: so i do think it's you know it's it's up to the government it we we have to depend on the government to be strong in that area 

122.62 123.52 B: yeah 

125.96 126.72 B: yeah 

128.86 135.89 B: i i agree with you with that i don't know if we were weak in the actual intelligence area i think we were weak on the actions area 

135.90 141.79 A: oh okay now i do agree with you there because every time we and i i appreciate that comment because every time 

141.79 150.91 A: uh during the uh clinton administration when we did have some type of uh uh terroristic attack he would always say well you know we're going to do something about it but never did 

147.09 147.81 B: yeah 

150.31 151.59 B: right 

151.04 156.83 A: so without the action that was you know behind the words as uh george w. bush did um 

154.09 154.88 B: yeah 

156.91 162.49 A: i guess we they just felt we were open to uh bioterror- or terroristic opportunities 

161.87 169.28 B: yeah i think that they didn't really well i think the problem was they didn't want to go in because no one would have supported it 

169.29 170.42 A: right 

169.60 172.48 B: i mean you saw what happened when we went into iraq 

171.88 173.80 A: mhm 

172.69 180.95 B: i mean still i mean after that they they thought they had good intelligence on that they did have weapons of mass destruction and obviously 

180.98 186.59 B: their saddam hassan wasn't being cooperative and still people were against the war so 

186.81 191.58 B: i think that was i think it's a major problem that people aren't for like taking more action 

191.62 193.36 B: to prevent these things 

193.01 195.39 A: well what do you think cause i mean why do you think people 

195.61 201.00 A: uh first of all i guess my question to you would would be were you surprised at the uh uh amount of 

201.13 206.01 A: uh non support that bush had within the united states itself 

206.39 212.03 A: uh not uh we you know not only considering the world community just within the united states and then 

210.68 221.37 B: [mn] [noise] i was a little surprised that the united states didn't really back us up i wasn't as surprised at the world community because that's how i think it's been through pretty much history i mean that's 

221.28 231.18 B: that's what happened with world war two and no one wanted to go to the war and then became a whole big thing because no one wanted to stop hitler when he first began you know invading other countries 

223.32 225.54 A: mhm 

229.19 230.27 A: right 

231.23 237.43 B: everyone they'd just be like well we don't want to get in another war 'cause they were still you know people were still upset about world war one 

237.87 245.85 B: so i think uh i think that's been like the world's opinion for a while now that they don't want to take military action 

246.10 247.57 B: uh you know 

247.72 256.14 B: i mean i think the the thing with september eleven was we had the support was 'cause well it just happened and i think people felt we had some evidence that it was them 

255.59 256.94 A: right 

256.31 260.52 B: but if people don't want to like go to the war unless you know 

261.18 263.81 B: unless it's like in their backyard 

264.06 277.85 B: and i think you know that a lot of times united states likes to go into other countries and try and help out and and they they've always i mean they that's definitely been a policy over the last couple of years and definitely with the clinton administration 

277.96 281.76 B: uh he went into you know some countries and you know 

282.01 284.39 B: it didn't always work out the best for us 

284.25 285.70 A: right 

285.11 292.86 B: i mean especially when we went to somalia a lot of people thought we shouldn't be there and even when we went into bosnia people thought we shouldn't be there 

287.34 288.09 A: (( mm )) 

293.62 306.51 A: well a lot of people have even gone as far as saying that he was doing those type of actions just to take the uh pressure off of himself as far as what he was going through personally and uh take the uh direction off the white house and put it someplace else 

293.82 294.57 B: (( so )) 

299.32 300.30 B: yeah 

301.72 303.07 B: yeah 

305.90 307.59 B: yeah 

306.73 308.76 A: um now what 

307.78 315.96 B: i don't know if i agree with that as much because there's there's definitely other things that were going on in the world that he could have directed attention to 

311.96 313.18 A: right 

313.25 314.16 A: right 

317.01 321.16 B: um i don't know how much people would have cared about them you know 

321.08 322.83 A: right 

321.67 328.35 B: i mean if you'd have put well if clinton started talking about you know we're going to go into al qaeda and do all these things no one would have cared 

328.65 330.44 B: (( you know but )) 

330.49 339.28 B: i i don't know i don't know how you felt about the iraq war but i i thought you know before we went in i thought it was a good idea and i actually supported the war 

339.34 340.76 A: no i did yeah i 

341.16 351.06 A: i i guess just as far as reference points uh now i i come from a very strong uh conservative republican background and in this respect uh 

351.22 357.19 A: i guess i was also a little concerned that maybe people forget too easily as to what the 

355.29 356.48 B: (( mm yeah )) 

356.98 371.35 A: what happened here on nine eleven and and the impact that it uh played on the united states and there's no doubt about it i mean there there has to be some sensibility as to you know what the u._s. can and cannot do in 

370.45 371.44 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

371.22 377.26 A: in respect of foreign relations and especially toppling foreign governments but you know 

377.58 381.19 A: from you know what again we're at the mercy of whatever the uh 

381.25 389.80 A: government uh puts out as to what is happening in in each country but but still i i i felt very comfortable that iraq was a 

386.81 387.60 B: right 

389.92 393.15 A: um stronghold for terrorist activities 

392.26 407.21 B: yeah and it obviously is 'cause even though they haven't found weapons of mass destruction they have found al qaeda cells there and there's obviously other terrorism going on there i mean i mean not too many people were going to say that oh no there's no terrorism going on 

398.01 399.75 A: right 

407.12 411.14 B: in iraq it may not be well i wasn't necessarily sure it was al qaeda 

407.14 408.15 A: right 

411.01 412.76 A: mhm 

411.82 417.46 B: but i'm sure there was terrorism going on and even if it's not that regime wasn't too good to begin with anyway so 

413.83 414.65 A: right 

416.90 421.45 A: right and then going back to the opening statement that i came up with or had is is 

421.38 433.53 A: is we have to the government has to protect their own citizens and and uh that wasn't you know that was a definitely an opportunity to protect the uh 

424.71 425.49 B: yeah 

425.92 427.07 B: yeah 

433.56 441.27 A: uh homeland of the u._s. now that we've seen that we're not invincible that we can be attacked on our own ground um 

435.32 436.16 B: yeah 

439.68 442.09 B: yeah i i i agree 

442.09 455.79 B: and i think i forget what i was going but i was going to say uh people definitely i definitely agree with that i think they should do it and i have no prob- i have no problem with the government getting involved with foreign elections especially in some of those you know 

448.19 449.27 A: so start 

449.39 450.40 A: (( right )) 

451.97 452.81 A: (( right )) 

455.70 456.65 A: right 

456.02 462.80 B: third world countries to help get people in there that are going to be more supportive of the united states like i think that's okay 

461.32 462.28 A: yes 

462.64 467.05 A: yeah because if it if there's an opportunity that it can bring um any type of uh 

466.88 469.41 A: harm to the u._s. then we're entitled to 

467.92 468.85 B: right 

469.22 472.60 A: you know defend ourselves and protect ourselves uh 

472.58 483.03 A: as long as there's people who want to do harm to the u._s. then the u._s. has all the right in the world to uh protect herself and do what's necessary for the protection so i think you know same thing with the bioterrorism i mean what 

476.48 477.57 B: (( right yeah yeah )) 

483.02 488.79 A: i wouldn't i would not have any qualms with the u._s. doing whatever's necessary you know to 

487.06 488.63 B: (( right sometimes )) 

488.65 498.51 B: yeah sometimes i think we're a little weak though in like actually trying to prevent it 'cause i mean it's a well well known fact that the nuclear plants are like hard ea- pretty easy to break into 

496.85 500.10 A: mhm right 

499.17 503.63 B: like i mean even though like my dad uh he works for general electric 

503.35 505.18 A: mhm 

504.04 511.19 B: and he said you know before nine eleven he would just drive up to a nuclear plant and no one would ask him anything he would just drive his car in there 

511.80 516.18 B: and like no one would say anything to him i mean he could just walk right in 

513.51 515.34 A: (( [noise] right )) 

516.24 523.16 B: and now he said even with nine eleven he said it was still like pretty easy to get into them like he didn't really have to go through much security or anything 

522.91 524.57 A: (( yeah )) 

523.45 526.29 B: like he just walked i mean he just 'cause i mean 

526.34 531.03 B: he just has like a simple general electric badge like it's easy to forge you know 

530.99 537.54 A: right [laughter] well you know it's interesting you say that because we have a big g._e. plant that builds gas turbines here in graniteville 

537.08 537.79 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

537.73 541.33 A: when we went up one level a couple of months ago um 

541.33 553.48 A: i drove by the plant the day after the increased security alert was alert was made and they did have security out front but that lasted all of one day then the next day i drove by and it was nobody was there so 

546.43 547.37 B: mhm 

550.02 551.03 B: right 

552.36 553.25 B: right 

553.63 557.41 B: yeah it was i mean it was he said they're pretty still i mean 

557.68 563.08 B: like ours is right in harrisburg it's only you know fifty sixty miles away from our house but still 

560.28 561.87 A: (( yeah )) 

562.28 563.99 A: yeah 

564.54 565.42 B: so 

565.67 568.06 B: i definitely think they could you know 

568.17 572.14 B: do more i know bioterrorism is more like uh 

572.38 578.04 B: it's harder to deal with because i mean it's just like implanting like something in the water supply 

578.10 579.15 A: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

578.40 587.42 B: i mean it's just that easy i mean no one's checking you know every water supply everywhere what's being you know going into everywhere i 

587.88 593.37 B: mean the chances are if there was a bioterrorist attack like we wouldn't even know about it for a couple of weeks or something 

593.50 596.12 B: 'cause the people would start getting sick you know 

597.12 599.89 B: so it would be hard to it would be harder to
