108.76 110.51 B: again apologies 

109.86 112.89 A: that [laughter] happens 

113.42 118.94 A: ah it w- b- it was um of course a lot more ah 

120.06 122.34 A: difficult at the time but you know 

122.35 123.41 B: yeah 

122.86 124.04 A: it happens 

124.76 128.90 B: are you like a definite cat person do you think or you don't know 

128.03 129.86 A: (( mm no )) 

130.01 135.71 A: ah actually my wife would much prefer a dog which is what she had as a child 

133.66 134.62 B: (( oh yeah )) 

135.42 136.81 B: mhm 

136.50 139.26 A: um and ah 

139.87 144.47 A: i i like dogs too it's just that we like to be able to go places 

144.30 145.14 B: yeah 

144.52 153.14 A: and cats are a lot easier to deal with than dogs in that you know in that sense you can always just 

153.73 160.90 A: have you can leave a cat by itself for you know a weekend without any problem um 

159.80 160.70 B: right 

161.10 162.15 A: (( but )) 

161.31 165.29 B: yeah a dog not so much we actually had that problem with my mother we ah 

162.53 163.85 A: (( yeah a dog )) 

165.31 168.45 B: she's widowed recently and we decided that we were going to 

168.53 169.64 B: get her 

169.72 172.89 B: a dog because she's in the home alone now all of her children are 

173.39 185.17 B: old and on their own so we figured that would be the best idea but she too is now in that well i want to go on and get on with my life and do things and travel and see things i've never seen 

174.74 175.63 A: mhm 

177.53 178.50 A: mhm 

185.18 186.31 A: uh-huh 

185.68 191.83 B: and she is unfortunately allergic to cats because that would be a lot more ideal conducive to her schedule but 

191.91 192.70 A: (( mm )) 

192.28 193.14 B: (( you know )) 

193.31 194.68 B: not going to happen 

194.42 195.77 A: yeah 

196.02 196.76 B: but 

196.64 200.80 A: so what would happen to i mean does she did you get her a dog or 

200.50 208.11 B: no we ultimately couldn't just because we knew we couldn't make the commitment and we're also kind of dog snobs um and 

200.97 203.16 A: oh okay okay okay 

203.82 204.89 A: right 

206.54 207.34 A: uh-huh 

208.04 223.02 B: we would really want to get her you know a pure bred puppy and really take care of it and since she's working to support herself now she doesn't really have the time to train a puppy and we really can't house train it at any of our houses and then 

222.96 226.68 B: expect it to adapt easily to hers because it would be a big shift 

226.32 227.61 A: mhm 

227.01 230.40 B: so we're kind of holding off on that but 

227.72 228.64 A: yeah 

229.85 231.20 A: mhm 

230.50 232.02 B: hopefully ah 

232.40 238.15 B: one of the siblings one of the three kids are going to get a dog and just make frequent visits home i guess 

237.89 239.19 A: [laughter] 

238.56 242.51 B: because ah i don't think any of us want grandkids because as far as time ah 

242.71 246.73 B: time commitments we'd rather have a pet all of us 

245.47 246.45 A: mhm 

246.88 248.13 A: mhm 

247.50 248.81 B: but um 

249.63 250.74 B: yeah 

250.18 250.90 A: (( mm )) 

251.13 252.40 B: (( hm )) 

252.52 260.60 A: yeah so i guess yeah um we're supposed to talk about how much time we spend with our pet i actually feel slightly bad because our 

260.76 267.27 A: our cat used to be an in house cat but ah she and her sister 

267.78 273.27 A: no matter i mean we went to heroic efforts trying to train them to stop doing this that they were 

273.42 276.46 A: marking ah the carpets 

276.17 277.52 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

276.94 282.21 A: ah severely [laughter] and it just 

282.94 284.78 A: looks bad smells bad 

285.01 287.36 A: and it's just not healthy 

285.90 286.79 B: (( [noise] )) 

287.41 293.87 A: eventually we had to banish them ah they're you know so they basically have the run of the garage and the yards so 

293.63 294.48 B: (( right [noise] )) 

294.15 296.87 A: i don't get a whole lot of time to ah 

296.91 300.54 A: to spend time with ah with the one that's remaining 

301.53 302.73 A: um 

303.01 311.43 A: but you know every once in a while you know on a weekend we'll let her in and she basically spends her time on my lap 

311.10 312.19 B: mhm 

311.57 313.60 A: while i'm trying to ah 

313.74 315.86 A: work at the computer or whatever 

315.98 319.09 B: and you don't have the territory marking problem anymore 

318.56 324.78 A: no she's on excellent behaviour when she's visiting the house 

323.67 326.24 B: [laughter] good good 

325.50 333.05 A: but ah we don't ah we don't we try not to leave her unsupervised just ah just in case so 

332.41 333.68 B: yeah 

333.14 335.08 A: i mean she she gets to 

335.43 343.57 A: you know she gets the run of the place but we just try and keep an eye on her to make sure she doesn't go back to old bad habits 

343.11 344.62 B: mhm 

344.80 349.86 B: yeah i actually i live near a college town and the one thing i remember having a conversation recently 

349.87 357.10 B: that i noticed i found remarkable that there are so many young people who do have pets young people who don't have their own homes and who have their 

357.63 369.17 B: little college town apartments that aren't in the best condition and they've got their own busy schedule and barely enough time for themselves and i don't understand how they can possibly make a commitment to have i see all of them walking around with 

369.30 372.02 B: with dogs of some kind and um 

370.75 371.68 A: (( mm )) 

372.13 373.64 B: i just imagine 

374.20 381.80 B: you know it it seems to me and i could be absolutely wrong because i've never owned a cat but it just seems to me that the cat is more conducive to 

382.29 389.55 B: making your schedule work for it better because it is such an independent creature and and i i have a feeling 

387.27 388.22 A: yeah 

389.44 397.52 B: but i don't i don't know if i have any [laughter] actual information to back this up but cats just seem to be healthier creatures 

397.22 399.23 A: mhm 

397.89 400.24 B: you know they just seem to have 

400.94 405.98 A: well psychologically i mean [laughter] you know they seem to be a lot more ah a 

406.56 409.04 A: lot more independent and less um 

409.52 412.49 A: less tendency to um 

413.24 414.85 A: neur- neurosis 

414.89 415.80 B: mhm 

414.93 417.37 A: than than ah dogs 

417.79 420.48 A: (( ah i think it's just you know the way they've )) 

420.69 423.09 A: ah the way they've been bred 

422.84 424.37 B: right 

424.57 436.04 A: and then again also um i'm not sure that that there's as much um tendency to go for purebreds in ah in cats as there ah as there is in dogs 

435.81 437.33 B: absolutely 

437.41 447.93 A: i have a feeling that that tends to be healthier to have the mixed ah the mixed genetics and it ah the purebreds i mean there are some pure bred cats 

447.95 449.70 A: and like the dogs 

449.80 456.15 A: they they tend to have more um they tend to be more quirky ah 

455.29 456.34 B: mhm 

456.64 458.57 A: and some of them are just plain 

458.76 460.22 A: stupid i 

459.45 463.20 B: [laughter] i i agree whole heartedly 

463.29 464.37 B: um 

464.97 472.92 A: mean there are there are some purebred ah purebreds of ah ah dogs that that seem to be you know really 

473.03 476.87 A: just great robust and um and fun 

477.03 478.44 A: and 

478.28 480.57 B: but it's so dangerous like i've seen 

480.58 489.39 B: one specific pure breed that requires so much attention so much time so much energy is like the greyhound because although it's a 

487.34 488.43 A: mhm 

489.61 503.64 B: faster dog it's not strong at all and it's not it's not built for home life and a really good friend of mine actually had a greyhound and unfortunately also lived in a split level house and it was the worst the dog couldn't 

494.54 495.29 A: yeah 

500.07 500.89 A: (( mm )) 

503.64 511.39 B: do anything it needed constant attention and constant care because it couldn't really get around and the first time i met it i thought it was ill because it 

509.04 509.75 A: (( mm )) 

511.47 515.84 B: apparently the greyhound just shakes naturally a lot 

515.29 516.05 A: (( oh )) 

515.85 517.28 B: and um 

517.62 519.27 B: i just found that the 

519.61 533.78 B: the owner's children had to take a lot more care of the dog because they were around more they were in a two working parent household and they just since they were around more even though they had school to contend with their schedules they 

533.75 540.32 B: still had to go and you know assume the responsibility because the dog needed that much attention and they were the ones who had 

540.51 544.45 B: that free extra four or five window of ti- hours of time 

543.90 544.80 A: (( oh )) 

545.54 546.96 A: [laughter] 

546.35 547.70 B: but 

547.87 548.96 A: (( yikes )) 

548.99 550.44 B: a little bit yes 

550.60 559.61 B: yeah yikes for that but personally when i get my dog i know i'm going to get a dog but i w- i have to wait till i move but when i do get my dog it's going to be 

560.31 568.54 B: a very little in house dog my the rest of my family's all about the big dogs my sister just bought some property and she's got 

562.58 563.54 A: mhm 

568.73 578.16 B: a lot of space to have a very outdoorsy dog so she actually wants to get two labs she wants to get a ah a chocolate lab and a black lab and i i can't understand why 

574.33 575.13 A: (( ah )) 

578.24 583.31 B: because they're so much work and they have way too much energy but i guess she's got 

582.19 585.65 A: and then when they shake their heads you've got to stand back 

584.87 591.78 B: [laughter] yeah but i guess she's got the acreage where they can they can you know do their shake and make their mess and 

591.23 592.72 A: mhm 

592.30 593.45 B: go ah 

593.42 594.45 A: (( yeah )) 

593.84 598.05 B: go unnoticed in a bad way [laughter] um 

595.93 597.18 A: [laughter] 

598.46 599.39 B: so
