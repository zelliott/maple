363.22 364.24 B: (( [mn] oh )) 

363.97 368.87 A: and we taught her young as soon as the first time she you know i'd shake the 

368.92 373.89 A: the uh the coins and make [mn] [mn] [mn] noises and she wouldn't do it 

371.21 372.35 B: oh really

414.63 415.84 B: (( oh my )) 

415.52 417.60 A: and then it was really funny 'cause i've 

416.60 418.17 B: she's a real princess 

417.85 429.24 A: oh i know and then my my daughter and i were gone for the weekend and my husband he goes i don't know what's wrong with the cat she meows and she wants to eat so i put her up there and i walk away and she comes

437.45 441.34 B: oh mine's right here right now looking at the phone 

438.52 439.39 A: and then 

440.97 446.84 A: and she's like my daughter not my daughter my cat also she learned from the dog how to beg 

446.88 448.15 B: oh really 

447.10 449.48 A: and she begs worse than the dog 

449.01 450.51 B: oh jeeze 

449.60 462.33 A: you'd be eating and she'll go up on your she'll you know stand up on her hind legs and she'll just like pat you not hard but just like someone would tap you on your shoulder yeah like hello it's me 

458.29 461.28 B: i'll just tap at you [lipsmack] yeah 

461.39 468.94 B: that's one of the things my daughter said she misses most about the older cat that passed away but he wasn't even two yet the second one 

467.89 468.84 A: uh-huh 

468.92 474.04 B: is that when he would beg he'd come in the kitchen they wouldn't they know they're supposed to leave us alone when we're eating 

473.67 474.48 A: uh-huh 

473.98 478.46 B: so the dog would stay in the living room and just stare at you we have a german shepherd 

476.54 479.19 A: yeah [laughter] [mn] [laughter] 

478.40 493.31 B: and the cat would come right on the edge of the kitchen but if you looked at him or spoke to him he knew he wasn't supposed to come over and beg so instead he'd roll over and go meow and look really cute and roll over on his back and like turn upside down [laughter] 'cause he 

489.61 491.60 A: [laughter] 

491.66 494.27 A: [laughter] oh they got us pegged man 

493.21 498.28 B: yeah he knew if he was cute enough my daughter'd be slipping him something while i wasn't looking 

498.42 512.18 B: so but this one she's a she's cute we the other two were male this one's a female so that's different i didn't want a female just 'cause they cost more to fix [laughter] yeah they cost a lot more to get them spayed but 

507.66 509.43 A: do they really i didn't know that 

511.35 513.07 A: oh i didn't know that 

512.26 517.61 B: the humane society actually helped me so that was okay but today we're supposed to be getting a new kitten 

517.46 518.78 A: another one 

518.29 528.15 B: yeah my well 'cause we had two before so my daughter's like well now we need two again 'cause she needs a friend 'cause her and the dog the dog loved the cats but this kitten is really spooky 

520.51 521.25 A: uh-huh 

524.06 525.07 A: oh 

528.21 533.00 B: and she's still kinda spooked at the dog she if we even move too fast she'll run 

532.84 533.71 A: mhm 

533.07 540.76 B: even though she's really loving and wants to sleep on my stomach and stuff if i make too quick a movement she takes off so her name should have been spooky 

536.51 537.59 A: oh 

540.60 541.94 A: oh that's a good name 

540.88 543.11 B: [laughter] we named her xena 

543.21 549.14 B: warrior princess because she's she's small she's petite but she's real muscular 

548.96 550.84 A: huh interesting 

550.10 552.50 B: [laughter] she walks kinda like 

552.72 564.38 B: like someone who's just gotten off a horse [laughter] [laughter] so i don't know why i just came up with that it just kind of made me think of her as a little little tough cookie kinda [laughter] 

552.73 553.90 A: (( [noise] that's )) 

554.95 556.59 A: oh that's funny 

556.83 558.22 A: that's funny 

560.18 562.13 A: no i think that's a good name 

562.87 570.13 A: that's a good name ironically enough how i said great minds think alike before our corgis we had german shepherds too 

566.94 567.72 B: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

569.73 571.12 B: did you really 

570.49 572.80 A: yeah we had we had one 

572.71 584.88 A: i was nearly attacked by a german shepherd when i was a kid so i didn't my husband wanted a dog we started dog sitting for a friend of ours and it got to the point where she would come they were a single couple and we were married 

575.94 576.83 B: (( oh )) 

584.78 592.94 A: so they were always out and traveling and stuff so i said oh we'll watch them for the weekend well then we'd watch them for like a month or two or three 

591.98 593.19 B: wow 

593.03 599.89 A: and because they she'd say oh and she lived quite a you know maybe i don't know a long way away in the city and we live in the suburbs so 

598.03 599.21 B: (( mhm ))
