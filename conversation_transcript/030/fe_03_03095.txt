223.54 228.49 A: as many as i i was going to say as many as the animals as i have it's like an all day thing [laughter] 

228.71 231.34 A: right now the baby raccoons i've gotta feed them every 

229.89 233.19 B: so it's a full time job to take care of all of the animals

233.69 235.72 B: [laughter] 

235.11 247.10 A: i feed the cats a couple of times a day and like i said we got well we got baby chickens we just got this at easter time and raise them up to ha butcher 'em [laughter] i ain't telling them that though [laughter] 

241.32 242.35 B: [laughter] 

243.44 244.16 B: [laughter] 

244.91 252.34 B: [laughter] well they don't quite qualify as pets if you eat them do they 

247.69 248.76 A: [laughter] 

251.86 261.26 A: yeah really [laughter] when they're little we have to take care of them you know clean out their cages and stuff before we could put 'em in a bigger pen 'cause they couldn't stay outside 'cause it's too cold [noise] 

260.91 261.95 B: mhm 

261.33 264.54 A: so we had a you know they're kinda like pets then 

264.55 265.70 B: yeah 

264.65 267.74 A: so like the first time we had chickens out here 

268.08 271.04 A: we ah [sigh] my kids named every one of them 

270.94 273.53 B: uh-huh how old are your kids 

273.27 277.30 A: um i got a twelve year old and a sixteen year old 

276.65 277.73 B: mhm 

278.53 280.22 A: (( so [sigh] )) 

280.90 290.27 A: but yeah those animals are definitely a full time job we've had five five of our female cats had kittens this spring 

290.12 292.72 B: five of them that's a lot of kittens 

291.05 293.71 A: yeah oh yeah 

293.96 296.10 A: [noise] got a lot of kittens 

297.55 298.56 A: our kittens 

297.75 302.98 B: so what do you d- do you given them away or does they just fend for themselves 

301.42 315.27 A: well sometimes you know if somebody wants one we'll give 'em one you know and otherwise i mean i don't really i don't go to great extents with the outside cats you know as far getting shots and all that stuff 'cause there's just way to many of 'em [laughter] 

311.08 312.14 B: mhm 

313.07 314.21 B: mhm 

314.61 315.62 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

315.85 322.51 A: [laughter] i probably got about twelve or fifteen outside [laughter] and now we got a whole lot of babies [laughter] 

322.22 323.26 B: uh-huh 

323.07 327.45 A: but you know like i say wintertime comes and that usually 

328.27 329.58 B: down in numbers 

329.12 332.11 A: yeah i will send a few of them 

331.15 335.26 B: do you feed the outside cats or assume that they're fending for themselves 

335.20 340.65 A: well we do feed 'em cat food you know scraps but otherwise you know just twice a day 

341.26 342.42 A: otherwise they 

342.72 344.65 A: have to hunt for themselves 

344.34 351.31 B: yeah but that's sort of the reason to have them is to have them hungry enough that they keep the rat supply down 

350.75 359.03 A: yeah yeah we haven't really the last few years i haven't really seen a lot of mice in the house you know wintertime comes around they get in somehow 

356.61 357.56 B: mhm 

359.22 361.37 A: and i see one or two but i haven't 

361.49 366.68 A: really seen any in the last couple of years but with as many cats as we have there shouldn't be any [laughter] 

366.44 367.26 B: yeah 

367.50 369.56 B: unless the cats are too well fed 

369.16 376.41 A: [laughter] i know as my husband keeps saying don't feed them damn things [laughter] make 'em hunt 

372.70 374.92 B: [laughter] 

376.69 385.41 A: [mn] but i tell you i've lived here for like about eight or nine years and where we're at right now and i have never seen a squirrel yet and or rabbits 

384.75 385.76 B: uh-huh 

385.56 386.64 A: cats 

386.55 388.91 B: the cats keep those supplies down 

387.48 392.03 A: yeah [laughter] you don't have to worry about rabbits getting into our garden so [laughter] 

391.13 392.28 B: mhm 

393.19 394.82 A: cats pretty much keep them 

393.80 397.36 B: did you grow up in the town or from des moines or
