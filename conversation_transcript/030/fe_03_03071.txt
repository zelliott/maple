241.03 243.13 A: yeah i'm about the 

241.93 246.95 B: and he does not he has not gotten fat that which i i don't understand because that calico cat 

247.11 252.63 B: didn't even eat that much i mean 'cause we would measure the food and everything and that cat 

251.22 252.10 A: yeah 

252.94 260.76 B: there'd be like a whole bunch of food left over because neither cat would eat a lot but she got fat even though she was fixed so who knows 

259.28 273.32 A: yeah you know she isn't ah ours isn't fat she's just really shiny coat and and smooth coat and she's one of those um [lipsmack] oh i don't know the color is is kind of a that reddish you know
