151.09 156.43 B: no more pets once this dog you know once this dog dies you're not allowed to have any more pets 

156.57 163.27 B: so yeah we always had a dog when i was growing up though we've had ah three different dogs 

156.60 158.03 A: oh yeah [mn] 

162.79 166.57 A: what kind of breeds were they like mixed breed what kind of mixes 

166.17 177.43 B: well the one my mother has now my dog she's part um cocker spaniel and i don't know what el- i don't know what the other part of her is i don't know 

177.30 178.38 A: mhm 

177.85 185.97 B: but yeah she has kind of a cocker spaniel's face got curly ears she looks like a cocker spaniel but you can tell there's something else mixed in with her 

181.91 183.00 A: mhm 

185.73 186.85 A: mhm 

186.83 190.73 B: and then we had another dog before her that was 

191.12 203.73 B: part beagle and part something else you could tell she was beagle she had the long floppy ears and all that um and before that i don't know w- we had a dog named tippy when i was a little kid um [mn] 

196.91 197.98 A: mhm 

203.85 213.61 B: i don't know what she was she was literally a mutt i mean [mn] she had no discerning characteristics at all [mn] she was just a very generic looking dog you know 

210.76 211.87 A: mhm 

212.89 214.14 A: mhm 

213.97 217.60 B: you couldn't tell what she was she was we got 'em all from the pound though 

217.60 218.69 A: mhm 

217.91 219.21 B: (( they were all pound dogs )) 

220.10 221.02 B: um 

221.58 225.59 B: she was my favorite dog though she lived she lived for a long time too 

223.26 224.24 A: yeah 

225.61 228.59 B: all of our dogs lived for a long time 

225.92 226.59 A: you 

227.89 230.69 A: that's probably you keep 'em well [mn] 

230.21 236.99 B: yeah well my mother was always under the assumption that if you buy a pure bred dog they always have problems 

237.16 251.83 B: they always seem to have health problems yeah [mn] so she would never buy a pure bred dog she would always buy a mutt she would always buy you know go to the pound and get a dog for thirty dollars you know instead of paying all that money for a dog that only lives five or six years 

237.41 239.55 A: yeah that's true sometimes though 

248.25 249.27 A: mhm 

250.10 253.23 A: did she did she get young young dogs or older ones 

252.47 257.61 B: yeah we would she would never buy a dog that was older than like a year i think a a year old was the oldest one 

257.38 258.53 A: (( oh really )) 

257.84 261.97 B: yeah that when we got it it wasn't it was just barely a year old 

261.46 266.54 A: [mn] i bet it's hard though for the um older dogs at the pound to find a new family 

266.15 269.02 B: yeah i would imagine so um 

269.11 271.06 A: especially if they were larger 

270.91 277.00 B: yeah 'cause when you walk through the pound if you see all these cute little puppies and then you see those big dogs 

276.65 277.87 A: mhm 

277.26 281.99 B: i don't know who would opt for the big dog when they can take home you know something that's cute [mn] 

282.41 285.61 A: yes plus the the bigger ones you know they're 

285.87 294.66 A: already sometimes they're a little aggressive 'cause they feel uncomfortable in the um [mn] you know at the pound so i think it's hard harder for them 

291.69 292.99 B: yeah i guess 

293.45 301.42 B: yeah they they grew up in another environment and they're used to another environment and then you know they end up at the pound i guess that could be traumatic you know 

296.92 298.19 A: mhm 

301.28 315.61 A: yeah i always you know i'm always like that's why i was always tempted to um get an older dog from the pound but then i was like you know what then i'm going to have problems with it just because i feel sorry for it i cannot take problems home so 

311.64 312.69 B: yeah 

315.80 318.04 A: [mn] it was kind of like yeah 

319.26 321.61 A: kind of like that too [laughter] 

322.46 325.32 B: well the other thing about an older dog is 

322.61 323.52 A: but 

325.54 333.07 B: [mn] i think well why is it at the pound why did they get rid of it does it do something that they don't like does it bite people you know why is it you know 

330.56 331.61 A: (( mm )) 

331.87 338.89 A: [mn] really that's that's not what i would have thought at at all that's nothing that would have came to my mind at all [mn] 

338.10 344.40 B: that's the first thing i think of if somebody had this dog until it was this old why did they get rid of it [mn] you know 

340.03 341.21 A: really 

343.91 355.55 A: no because um i don't know people don't have time as much any more or people move and can't take the dog and [mn] people run out of money there's all kinds of reasons why people 

354.46 365.50 B: yeah yeah i mean i yeah i know that's true in the back of my mind but the first thing that comes to my mind is what's wrong with this dog [laughter] why'd they get rid of this dog something must be wrong with it 

359.94 362.09 A: really that's not what i would think 

365.40 376.77 A: i mean if if that's the same thing if somebody breaks up and i don't know breaks up with somebody why did they get rid of that person you can't say because that person has you know what i mean [mn] it's like people get 

376.90 380.57 A: get rid of certain things f- for all different kinds of reasons i 

379.88 381.27 B: (( ah yeah that's )) 

380.70 386.89 A: mean if you sell a car you don't always only sell it because it- it's it has a problem yeah 

384.23 387.27 B: something's wrong with it yeah well that's true 

387.39 389.64 A: [mn] but um 

389.67 394.82 A: i don't know [mn] i wish i could have did you have any other pets like birds 

395.24 404.96 B: my mother yeah when we were kids we always my mother said you know no more pets after you guys grow up me and my sister and she pretty much stuck to that except for the dog 

395.32 396.53 A: or fish 

401.98 403.15 A: mhm 

404.95 410.94 B: um she liked birds we always had um like tropical birds and stuff in the house [mn] 

409.71 410.78 A: mhm 

411.05 412.30 B: um 

411.66 414.67 A: i did too parakeets and stuff [noise] mhm 

414.10 416.99 B: she had an african gray parrot 

416.92 418.22 A: oh wow 

417.80 420.10 B: and a mynah bird 

420.40 421.21 A: (( ahah )) 

421.32 422.80 B: um 

422.83 427.67 B: i don't even you know i wasn't i didn't really like the birds [mn] i don't even remember their names 

427.04 427.94 A: (( how come )) 

428.05 429.49 B: i don't know i 

428.67 430.10 A: too boring to you 

429.95 436.00 B: guess you couldn't take 'em out and play with them or you know at at most you'd let 'em out and they'd fly around the house and then 

435.26 437.91 A: no you can play with them if you have a good um 

438.14 441.65 A: if for some reason you have a good i don't know how you call it connection with them 

441.26 442.40 B: yeah 

441.84 446.37 A: you can they have a lot of personality like they will kiss you and 

445.01 453.25 B: yeah my mother could do that because they they were used to my mother she was the one that fed them and groomed them and took them out of the cage and everything 

446.63 447.79 A: yeah me too 

452.48 453.76 A: mhm 

453.16 463.88 B: i never did that they didn't really you know if i tried to if i put my hand in the cage i got bit [laughter] i didn't right they didn't right they didn't know who what i was or who i was but 

458.28 461.53 A: right because they they didn't have the connection with you 

463.68 464.90 A: mhm 

464.31 468.14 B: i mean i wasn't really interested in them either you know i liked ah 

467.24 470.26 A: that's why probably you never developed a connection with them 

469.49 478.60 B: yeah because i was more apt to want to go out and you know take the dog in the yard and play with the dog you know take it outside not 

474.99 476.45 A: mhm 

478.07 481.49 A: but they do have a lot of personality because i had two of 'em 

481.08 482.33 B: mhm 

481.72 484.51 A: and then [mn] one of them died 

484.96 494.01 A: [mn] and um after the her um her mate or whatever died the the female wouldn't eat for like two weeks and be 

489.68 490.57 B: (( ahah )) 

492.16 495.38 B: yeah get like lonely yeah 

494.72 496.19 A: yeah be very lonely 

496.39 497.36 A: and then 

497.42 499.98 A: [mn] whenever we went on vacation 

499.99 501.90 A: we would give him to the neighbors 

501.48 502.39 B: (( ahah )) 

502.30 507.14 A: and they kind of like felt it like before like when you were actually i don't know [mn] 

507.16 508.57 A: they have a very 

508.88 517.83 A: [mn] i don't know they kind of like felt that something was going on and they got scared and [mn] they also felt when it was going to rain they were acting different too 

513.07 514.06 B: (( ahah )) 

517.52 519.04 B: oh really 

518.48 523.57 A: yeah they have a they have a lot of like compared 'cause i had a guinea pig too 

523.21 524.08 B: (( ahah )) 

524.01 526.47 A: (( in comparison with the guinea pig [mn] )) 

526.54 529.05 A: birds have a lot more personality 

529.67 532.97 B: w- i can imagine that [mn] 

531.20 538.62 A: because a guinea pig really doesn't doesn't really remember you and [mn] i don't know a guinea pig is not very smart [mn] but 

533.09 533.90 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

537.66 539.24 B: [laughter] 

538.87 542.15 A: the birds actually have a lot of personality 

542.27 548.20 A: i was really surprised 'cause i always thought they were like boring kind of like boring and just you know 

542.30 543.16 B: yeah 

548.03 554.61 B: yeah i guess that's pro- about the same way i looked at 'em like you know why would anybody want to buy a bird for a pet you know 

554.35 567.16 A: yes that's what i thought too and my parents would only allow me a bird at first because they thought everything else was too much work so i got the bird but it has a lot of personality with e- emotions and and 

556.12 557.09 B: yeah 

567.56 573.49 A: i was really surprised 'cause compared to the guinea pig i mean it was just so such a big difference 

572.29 577.80 B: mhm well i can imagine compared to a guinea pig i can't imagine a guinea pig has too much personality [mn] 

576.87 578.35 A: no he doesn't 

578.51 582.42 B: just kind of sits there and sits there and makes noises all day 

578.82 580.79 A: i'm afraid it doesn't 

583.02 584.18 A: (( like um )) 

584.49 587.04 A: [mn] my guinea pig was pregnant a lot 

587.05 589.43 B: really did you have more than one 

587.82 588.79 A: mhm 

589.42 591.30 A: yeah i had two but 

591.36 596.22 A: oh my god over like the period of a year we had at least like twenty little ones 

595.76 597.46 B: oh my god 

596.99 599.95 A: and um [mn] but after she
