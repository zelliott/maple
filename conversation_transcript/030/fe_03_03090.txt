122.59 132.91 B: o- it wasn't about pets it was about um inappropriate humor or something like that was it it was that was a hard one to talk about i thought

129.59 130.44 A: uh-huh 

131.58 132.81 A: yeah that was

135.75 144.91 B: so you know what's inappropriate to men isn't always inappropriate to women and what's inappropriate to women isn't always inappropriate to men so that was a little bit difficult

157.55 158.83 B: yeah right 

158.91 160.54 A: get 'em in a grocery store 

158.93 160.41 B: do you do any 

160.44 162.31 B: do you anything with your dog 

162.80 174.99 A: ah we you know what we've just since my cat died we've been letting her inside and so she sleeps with us and i mean the whole works the only thing that we don't have her trained to do is to s- 

168.04 168.88 B: uh-huh 

169.74 170.51 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

175.11 177.40 A: if you open the front door she's gone 

177.18 178.99 B: yeah yeah 

177.83 191.46 A: yeah and so we ordered one of those um pet trainers like as seen on t._v. and it's very high pitched you know but she can hear it but you can't hear it it's working it's definitely working uh-huh it's working 

183.17 184.06 B: uh-huh 

185.65 186.77 B: yeah 

187.31 188.64 B: right 

188.78 192.41 B: oh is it really interesting interesting 

192.14 194.86 A: we'll open the front door completely open 

194.89 195.79 B: mhm 

194.93 201.46 A: stand outside and we'll she'll start getting close to it and we'll go no and we'll push that and she she won't even get close to that door 

200.61 205.19 B: oh interesting now does she have to she doesn't have to wear a collar or anything it's just a remote 

204.91 207.79 A: it's just like it looks like a garage door opener 

207.16 208.64 B: oh isn't that funny 

208.53 216.93 A: now if you put it up to your ear you gotta put it really close but you get that really high pitch and go wow that you know that didn't feel good so you can imagine what what the dogs are hearing 

213.81 214.94 B: right 

216.75 220.37 B: so what did you what did you how did you train 

220.39 221.47 B: her 

221.50 225.16 B: her with it i mean is it is it to 

225.69 229.70 B: as she as she approaches the door it's a negative 

229.81 231.79 B: reinforcement for her 

229.91 234.07 A: right what i do is i go no and i press that button 

234.13 235.03 B: okay 

234.14 242.06 A: and then it just stops her it's like and her head will cock and her ears will come up like ow you know what are you doing and 

237.18 238.88 B: (( yep )) 

240.36 241.51 B: yeah 

241.48 248.42 B: now have you thought like when after she's already like say she's 'cause i'm looking to do something for my black lab 

248.32 257.75 B: 'cause he i- i'd like to jogging off off leash and i'd like to be able to take him walking off leash and stuff but once he gets the freedom of off lease even though 

251.77 252.74 A: uh-huh 

257.96 270.68 B: i've taken him through um um pre-agility classes and advanced basics you know he's basically he wants t- you know he wants to go and so i was thinking about doing either an e. collar which i'm not too 

266.52 267.61 A: mhm 

270.63 273.99 B: keen on the electric collars or um 

272.58 274.67 A: they're so expensive 

274.63 275.45 B: (( hm )) 

275.24 279.19 A: they're very expensive yeah [laughter] 

276.70 278.27 B: yeah yeah 

278.38 288.31 B: um but i what i want to do is i want to do something to get his attention to look back at me and then you know come to me as th- as the safe as the safe place 

283.69 284.97 A: mhm 

288.25 298.70 B: um not to punish him just get his attention when he's you know half way across the field and i was wondering if that type of thing do you think that type of thing would be something i could use with him 

290.19 291.56 A: right 

297.62 312.10 A: well it says you know it says that you can teach him to heel you can teach him to ah don't jump on ya to get off the furniture with it you know right now we're we're teaching her not to go out not to go out that front door or or the back gate 

309.97 311.07 B: right 

311.89 312.71 B: uh-huh 

312.00 317.02 A: but um i- it probably would work it was only nineteen ninety five at as seen on t._v. 

315.55 317.75 B: now what is it what was the name of it again 

317.91 321.21 A: let me see if i still have any of the paperwork here 

321.43 323.25 A: i don't have the paperwork here but 

323.53 326.02 A: it was ah pet trainer 

325.49 326.97 B: oh pet trainer okay 

326.21 329.97 A: pet trainer just look up ah as seen on t._v. on your internet 

329.74 330.71 B: okay 

330.34 333.61 A: and then look up pet trainer and it'll be in there 

333.12 334.76 B: cool cool 

333.94 339.56 A: i read some place though that if you want to train your dog like what you're talking about put some 

339.68 348.96 A: snacks you know kibbles or whatever in a coffee can and shake it everytime you want him to do whatever you're telling him to do and then they know to come back to that can 

344.88 346.92 B: mhm yeah yeah 

348.43 349.94 B: right right 

349.07 352.67 A: you know we tried that but ah [laughter] 

351.16 366.03 B: yeah see the yeah the problem and i mean you know labradors are very food motivated so that's okay but the the problem with it is that i mean we he's gotta you know they both have a very large back yard to run around in and stuff but it again it's it's just the sense of freedom you know what i mean 

355.21 357.13 A: mhm mhm 

365.34 366.60 A: right 

365.83 380.63 B: to be able to go and um sometimes he just goes and he visits you know we have a two acre plot and then everybody in our neighborhood has about a two acre plot so he knows everyone you know he just goes and visits everyone it's like get back here you know 

375.70 376.57 A: (( wow )) 

378.62 379.72 A: right 

380.54 388.59 B: and of course mine's the only dog that's gone to obedience training and mine's the dog that runs away you know what i mean so it's really always impressive and 

385.11 386.43 A: [laughter] 

388.09 398.54 A: you can try this you know i mean for this dog her worst asset is to leave this yard and then she'll leave for about two hours the dogcatcher she plays cat and mouse with the dogcatcher 

395.78 397.08 B: right 

398.10 399.60 B: yeah yeah 

398.69 410.33 A: you know i mean they're looking for her they know she when she gets out but um it's actually working and she doesn't like it and you can hear it you know when you first get it put it up to your ear and you'll go whoa 

400.71 402.25 B: (( yep )) 

404.95 405.69 B: (( mm )) 

409.83 411.23 B: (( mhm mhm ))

411.36 412.25 B: yeah 

414.18 416.19 B: yeah cool 

417.09 418.25 A: try it 

417.10 427.12 B: well i'll be interesting to looking into that yeah 'cause the older lab she's you know i can give her more free reign but you know being twelve she's like okay mom's calling me back you know 

426.75 427.73 A: uh-huh 

427.06 434.84 B: the only thing that they the only thing she gets ah pretty selectively deaf on is ducks and water she loves water 

433.67 434.37 A: oh 

434.73 436.64 A: [laughter] 

434.87 441.89 B: but um but no they're they're pretty good now being out in texas do you have horses too or are you around horses or what 

441.70 453.13 A: we where we live here we're in the upper valley so it is the valley we don't have horses ourselves 'cause we own we our house right now sits on ah um three quarters of an acre 

447.96 448.81 B: uh-huh 

452.78 453.68 B: oh neat 

453.53 458.94 A: but it's not big you know we we don't have any horses but you can walk down the ditch 

458.89 459.56 B: (( mm mm )) 

459.00 466.40 A: and there's horses everywhere you know you see 'em riding on the ditch and you know it's nice but we're about to move to dallas 

460.63 462.86 B: oh okay yep 

462.95 463.75 B: uh-huh 

463.95 464.77 B: uh-huh 

465.92 467.07 B: oh neat 

466.78 471.97 A: and that's why we're trying to get this dog trained because i'm so afraid of losing her 

471.14 473.13 B: right right 

472.48 477.28 A: so afraid i'm going to lose her she's gonna take off and she'll be so lost 

474.27 475.38 B: (( yeah )) 

476.88 480.48 B: yep yep especially in the city that's just scary 

480.45 482.10 A: yes well 

480.92 482.67 B: (( you know that really is )) 

482.51 486.94 A: i found out from a vet that you can get those microchips put in 'em 

486.46 496.11 B: yes yeah and they are and they are good um my my puppy i actually rescued him from a labrador ah retriever rescue group 

495.37 496.96 A: mhm 

496.10 510.87 B: um and they tattooed him when he was little so he's definitely tattooed so if he ever gets lost without his collar on they're gonna actually call they'll call the rescue place and they've got all my information so um 

498.23 499.35 A: (( mm )) 

509.07 510.71 A: oh that's nice 

511.22 513.64 A: well you know those little chips are are cheap 

511.24 512.54 B: so that that 

513.75 526.42 B: yeah they're not bad at all and they don't you know there's not like you have to replace them or anything i mean once they're in there they're in there and they really they don't hurt the dogs the dogs don't even know they're there and ah there's very very rare case of being a reaction 

513.84 516.32 A: i thought that she would yeah 

521.52 522.49 A: uh-huh 

526.37 535.22 B: um at the site of penetration and stuff so it's um yeah they are they're very feasible in fact we generally have um 

529.56 530.97 A: right 

535.07 546.70 B: rabies clinics around here where like um it'll be sponsored by like the local kennel club or whatever and you can go and get your rabies shots for like five bucks and then you can get the microchip implanted for like twenty 

536.26 537.41 A: mhm 

543.52 544.39 A: wow 

546.50 551.36 A: oh my gosh and i thought and they were telling me forty down here and i thought that was cheap 

547.31 549.51 B: yeah so it's like 

550.57 555.77 B: right well this 'cause you don't have to pay for an office visit all you're paying for is the chip 

554.00 555.18 A: right 

555.97 557.35 A: well that's good 

556.12 563.75 B: and so um the only pro- the only reason i didn't get it done this year was because they ran out of chips and i was like yeah i was like um 

561.02 562.28 A: oh really 

563.58 571.48 B: i thought well okay should i do this or pay forty three dollars in the office [laughter] no [laughter] so [laughter] wait 'til next year [laughter] 

567.66 572.48 A: [laughter] i'll wait [laughter] 

571.72 575.43 B: it's okay i just told my dogs don't run away until after next year 

575.42 577.89 A: oh [laughter]
