3.23 5.45 B: this is anita 

4.61 6.22 A: hi this is liz 

6.15 10.58 B: hi liz okay so i guess we're talking about our pets 

9.85 11.46 A: right yes 

11.12 12.95 B: i have fish how about you 

12.88 17.26 A: i have two goldfish [noise] and we have two cats 

17.76 19.52 B: nice combination 

18.91 24.80 A: we used to have piranhas but we had them from like the size of your fingernail up until 

24.74 34.89 A: they were probably eight inches long and then they both died one of them i think just had a bad goldfish and you know it died and then the other one got put in that same water and it died too 

35.33 37.07 A: so those were fun to watch 

37.38 38.88 B: [laughter] yeah 

38.38 40.16 A: what kinda fish do you have 

39.78 41.23 B: ah tropical [lipsmack] 

40.81 42.44 A: ooh okay 

41.61 43.84 B: i have a a lot of knives 

44.26 48.45 B: a lot of platties i have a fifty five gallon tank 

47.82 50.52 A: oh my goodness yes that's a lot of work 

50.20 57.93 B: and i i try to keep eels knives just a nice assortment of color along with your longer stranger fish 

58.89 61.33 B: [sigh] and ah i went through 

61.46 65.20 B: when i first got the tank i've had the tank about two years now 

65.59 73.41 B: when i first got the tank it was the first tank i've ever had and i started off with a fifty five gallon i don't know why i would do such a thing 

68.46 69.78 A: (( mhm )) 

71.95 74.95 A: yeah i was going to say why did you start with such a big one 

73.83 77.70 B: [laughter] my guy he really wanted one 

75.78 77.59 A: [laughter] 

78.00 84.84 B: and so we put all these fish in there well i decided to clean the tank and i wasn't aware that you only clean one third 

84.68 86.99 A: right right yeah 

85.82 91.69 B: and so i took all the fish out and put them in individual baggies like when you buy 'em 

91.24 92.17 A: (( mhm )) 

92.36 95.77 B: and i i think we had about twenty five fish at that time 

95.50 96.66 A: oh my 

96.18 98.37 B: [laughter] and killed every one of them 

97.78 100.67 A: that's right yep you did [laughter] 

98.69 112.12 B: [laughter] so now i guess my tank's been running pretty solid for about the past year and a half i did buy an infected fish and gave all my fish ick 

111.85 114.42 A: oh i've seen that yes yeah 

113.85 117.27 B: oh it was bad but 

114.94 118.36 A: yes i know 'cause you spend a lot of money on that 

119.21 120.05 B: (( yah )) 

119.88 121.88 A: very much so yeah 

120.38 129.52 B: well i'll tell you i- i- if you ever know anybody with a fish tank if they get ick all you have to really do is just boost up your temperature to about eighty five 

128.91 130.76 A: oh and it just kills it off 

130.27 135.63 B: it'll kill it off and then there's i also buy some ick remover just to be safe 

131.11 132.64 A: (( oh )) 

135.78 140.28 B: but i lost probably about ten fish before i found that out 

139.82 141.54 A: okay yeah 

141.49 148.05 A: no we just and the only reason we have goldfish right now we have two of them is because my son had a science project to do 

147.90 159.52 A: and that was his project and you don't really kill goldfish you know [noise] they're pretty sturdy they just stick around and you can not feed 'em for a day and you know they're still there and [laughter] [noise] 

148.20 148.90 B: (( okay )) 

151.57 152.54 B: (( nah )) 

158.35 160.31 B: definitely low maintenance 

159.60 161.33 A: yeah but they are dirty 

162.04 164.42 A: you know they are one of the dirtier fish [noise] 

164.58 171.65 A: but my son is only in first grade so you know it's something to keep him occupied they're in the kitchen in a tank and stuff so 

171.16 174.82 B: [sigh] yeah and it teaches some sort of responsibility 

174.18 177.80 A: oh yeah yeah and he gets his kick out of watching them eat you know 

177.92 182.69 A: and then we have the two cats and the one of them will jump up there and just watch the fish so 

182.81 187.97 A: that's okay we've always had pets we've never had a house without a pet 

187.79 191.05 B: so does the kitty cats try to go for the fish 

190.66 195.95 A: no they did when we had the piranhas 'cause they were bigger you know and you could see 'em more clear 

195.72 196.59 B: uh-huh 

196.07 200.59 A: the one cat would just jump all the time at the tank and they were only in ten gallon tanks 

200.96 202.10 B: [laughter] 

201.09 212.34 A: and we had we had 'em together when they were little but then one started chewing on the other when they got big enough because they you know that's what they do and we had to separate them so we had one per tank 

212.49 223.90 A: so and they did live for probably six seven months before they got that bad goldfish and [lipsmack] it just killed it off and the pet stores around our area now 'cause i live in minnesota 

223.93 226.41 A: they don't sell piranhas anymore 

226.52 233.06 A: because people were growing them to a huge size and then putting them in the local lakes 

226.60 227.89 B: really 

232.74 234.28 B: oh lord have mercy 

233.72 237.02 A: uh-huh yeah isn't that terrible 

234.84 236.49 B: oh that's terrible 

237.40 240.30 B: to me those are some of the ugliest fish 

239.78 249.93 A: well these really i mean they're they're kinda cool to watch grow because they start so so little and no color and then they just grow with that pretty red and their their um 

249.83 256.00 A: gills all sparkle and you know their teeth their jaw starts protruding out you know and 

255.18 260.07 B: that's i think that's what freaks me out is the whole teeth thing [laughter] 

256.55 263.41 A: yeah the jaw and they're very aggr- very aggressive we never fed them by hand or anything you know of course we just um 

263.57 273.17 A: [lipsmack] threw in the fish and and mostly we just gave 'em frozen blood blood something or other i don't know yeah and they would just chow on them i mean they'd attack them 

268.85 270.34 B: blood worms 

273.43 277.56 A: but it was kinda interesting it was you know an experience 

277.30 280.36 B: i'll tell ya i was raised with about six hundred pets 

280.09 281.34 A: oh my gosh 

281.74 287.59 B: so if you're ever raised with that many animals something is always before you 

284.49 285.64 A: yeah 

287.34 288.47 A: (( right [mn] )) 

288.00 298.04 B: you know it wouldn't matter if it was my my softball games or either a horse has snapped a fence or the the cougar had got out or [laughter] 

296.23 298.35 A: oh my goodness where did you grow up 

298.12 299.61 B: indiana

347.70 355.92 B: oh i couldn't i hate that that's why i kinda like my fish but it's not a lot of work really as long as you maintain it 

353.53 354.50 A: no 

354.99 358.62 A: that's right and you can be gone for a period of time you know 

357.93 362.23 B: and the only other animal i accept is i had a big um

472.48 475.05 A: [laughter] it'd be worth it 

475.53 478.71 A: there you go yeah oh my oh 

477.43 479.44 B: so i'm sticking with the fish 

479.23 484.04 A: oh yeah no and our cats are just you know low maintenance too 

484.05 489.86 A: they let you know when their food dish is empty and they need water but otherwise you know they're good company too 

489.77 491.08 B: are they declawed 

490.78 499.92 A: yes oh yes we get 'em usually from the humane society that's the only place we'll get our cats so that they're grown already they're declawed and they're um already fixed 

499.54 501.85 B: and not to mention you're saving their life 

501.19 509.33 A: oh i know and they're you know they're like three years old and they're cheaper to buy that way they're only like seventy five dollars and it's got everything done already 

502.14 502.77 B: (( [laughter] )) 

509.90 512.99 B: my brother in law just bought a rottweiler 

512.64 513.83 A: ooh 

513.91 517.99 B: and as much as it's going to serve the purpose he got it for protection 

517.66 519.20 A: right 

518.33 522.98 B: 'cause he lives in a pretty bad neighborhood but he's never had an animal 

520.03 521.08 A: yeah 

522.96 524.46 A: oh 

523.70 532.13 B: and i told him you just and he's kinda cheap [laughter] i said you just really do not know what you're getting into [laughter] 

526.37 527.82 A: [laughter] 

531.23 533.56 A: no he's tied down now 

533.82 538.66 B: oh yeah it it's but that is he got his from the humane society also 

534.64 536.06 A: definitely yes 

538.09 541.21 A: oh he did oh 

539.11 545.37 B: yep so at least it did come you know shots and everything and it was um 

545.58 546.84 B: semi trained 

546.70 548.36 A: is it a a puppy 

548.24 550.08 B: ah three years 

549.42 550.79 A: oh it is ah 

550.44 557.25 B: three years old so they they got to pretty much obedience but not attack yet 

555.96 560.43 A: oh okay that's good yeah yeah 'cause those are strong dogs 

558.30 559.16 B: so 

560.76 563.07 A: oh my goodness very strong 

560.86 573.22 B: yeah well i told him if he's going to get a guard dog that is that's what i recommended because they do have the best mentality whereas your pits and your dobermans have the tendency to turn on you 

567.84 569.23 A: (( right yeah )) 

573.00 579.86 A: yeah oh yeah yep and those are good with they're very protective you know once they know you they will protect you 

579.59 582.90 B: right they're very possessive 

580.25 581.18 A: so 

581.24 589.12 A: yes right and especially if you had kids or anything they'd be very protective over them and yeah huh well 

587.77 596.42 B: but it's like i said as that dog eats [laughter] and and starts using the bathroom and that's just a lot to take as a first pet 

593.10 594.33 A: yeah 

596.05 597.96 A: does he have a yard 

598.05 599.89 B: um he has a
