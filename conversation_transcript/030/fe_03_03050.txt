111.80 113.19 B: yeah 

112.79 122.06 A: i've heard that siamese cats are um i've only seen a few of them in in person but i've heard that they are are cool but sometimes they have health problems did you ever have health problems with yours 

121.51 123.61 B: um maybe like 

122.68 125.99 A: i mean if he lived twenty two years then probably not 

124.34 125.45 B: yeah yeah 

125.23 140.12 B: yeah probably like probably no more than any other cat as it got old you know like probably just from age i guess like well i guess it it's hearing or his hearing started to get a little bad as he got older and a little bit but nothing like major 

129.47 130.23 A: yeah 

132.01 133.22 A: right 

136.99 137.75 A: yeah 

139.94 140.73 A: uh-huh 

140.44 145.46 B: yeah but ah they're they're real well mannered they're jus- they're like real calm they're not real 

145.57 147.58 B: not real hyper like some cats 

147.39 155.23 A: right and um do you do you are you like um you are close to home so you are able to take your dog for walks and stuff or 

147.95 149.14 B: yeah 

154.85 163.53 B: oh yeah i i do li- my my brother does it a lot of times so we usually share the job doing that yeah so 

160.24 161.04 A: yeah 

163.59 164.93 B: yeah what about you 

164.95 175.70 A: um well when i was keeping the dog um i would usually try and take a walk in the morning and evening and of course you know whenever i was in the house the dog was always following me around and stuff 

171.07 172.20 B: right 

175.06 177.23 B: right yeah we have a 

176.39 177.44 A: so i g- 

177.96 183.51 B: we have we have a big yard so a lot of times we just let it go out and run round you know yeah 

181.20 185.56 A: oh that's nice [laughter] it kind of takes the pressure off you to to do 

184.32 185.40 B: yeah 

185.57 189.02 B: yeah so so you live in washington d._c. so you 

188.44 190.10 A: (( it yeah )) 

189.42 194.09 B: so yeah so you don't can't really do that too much do you take it to the park and stuff like that 

193.63 196.46 A: yeah there there um in the town i live in um 

196.46 211.38 A: yeah i'm i'm in one of the suburbs there there's a nice dog park so we used to take it um take it there and usually about between about four and seven in the evening there would just be dozens of dogs out there because all these people would come out there and just let them run around crazy 

198.16 199.01 B: right 

200.75 201.63 B: really 

207.59 208.55 B: yeah 

209.30 210.34 B: yeah 

211.06 212.10 B: (( yeah i bet )) 

212.03 217.37 A: it's good for socializing your dog you know because if they just stay in the house by themselves all day then they get kind of crazy but 

214.06 214.88 B: yeah 

217.01 230.76 B: yeah i know what you're saying yeah that's kind of kind of how like even though there's not too many dogs around us but we kind of we let her run around our yard and stuff and so it sometimes sees the neighbors neighborhood dogs or animals whatever 

230.63 231.67 A: yeah 

231.05 235.39 B: but we li- i live in the woods so it does see a lot of other animals obviously 

235.23 235.98 A: really 

235.71 237.00 B: (( yeah )) 

236.51 240.24 A: is it is it good when you when you do take it on walks are you able to take it off the leash 

240.23 241.18 B: ah 

241.11 250.73 B: sometimes depends on it depends because a lot my dog my dog has a tendency to bite other dogs someti- or not other dogs but other people if they only if they pet him so like 

247.03 247.88 A: (( oh [noise] )) 

250.60 258.93 B: it's like when people come to my house sometimes it depending it's weird it some- depending on how my d- like how i respond to that person 

258.83 259.54 A: yeah 

258.84 260.69 B: sometimes my dog'll 

260.58 270.59 B: like one per- like a girl will come into my house sometimes and it will just go nuts on her and like bark at it like crazy and we have to put it away and then sometimes other times we can bring someone else in 

266.52 267.58 A: [laughter] 

270.36 281.61 B: and it'll be sen- real nice to it so it's weird depend i don't know w- i don't know what it is i don't know if it's because the person that we have might have pets and it smells it on them or something like that i'm not sure but 

270.53 271.33 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

281.71 290.81 A: yeah well i've i've i've been around a few cocker spaniels and they're always nice um one thing i've heard about them is that they sometimes get kind of overprotective of their owners or 

282.29 283.38 B: yeah 

286.40 287.28 B: yeah 

290.09 292.88 B: yeah that's that's a major thing 

291.04 291.96 A: and 

292.37 307.34 A: and so with and maybe even with um if a if a couple has kids or young if you you have a baby and you have a cocker spaniel sometimes they don't get along because the cocker spaniel has a tendency to bite or stuff like that but i don't know i mean that's that's kind of a generalization of course 

300.77 301.81 B: right 

303.18 304.46 B: right 

306.97 309.93 B: yeah that that's kind of true though because 

309.92 322.13 B: dog it definitely does we it's it's almost like it's trying to protect us now it's not even has anything to do with ah the d- the dog not liking the person it's just almost that it's trying to protect us 

314.78 315.59 A: right 

319.58 320.39 A: right 

321.87 322.87 A: yeah 

322.30 324.63 B: um and it's it's weird though 

325.00 327.27 A: and my dog is kind of the same way it's 

327.38 332.96 A: um sometimes little dogs have what what they they call it an inferiority complex you know where they 

331.96 332.79 B: right 

333.19 339.33 A: esp- either either around big dogs or um around people they sometimes feel threatened or stuff like that so 

338.75 340.39 B: right yeah 

340.04 343.95 A: so sometimes mine is a little bit aggressive but only if 

342.19 343.41 B: right 

344.32 345.50 A: sometimes if 

345.51 355.14 A: i mean she's she's social but sometimes if if a dog is kind of getting in her face too much then she'll kind of snap at them but not really to hurt them just to kind of make them back away a little bit you know 

354.27 357.73 B: right yeah yeah i understand yeah because ah 

357.70 360.27 B: (( my dog ah like sometimes )) 

360.20 369.14 B: we see sometimes there's dogs running around i don't even know where they come from but like sometimes in our neighborhood i guess they get loose from other other like houses or whatever but ah 

368.75 369.66 A: yeah 

369.08 375.83 B: they they sometimes come by my house and my dog sees them and through the door and [mn] goes nuts on it like they 

375.10 376.27 A: [laughter] 

375.80 385.35 B: just goes starts barking going crazy on it though sometimes sometimes they it doesn't mind being around other animals and sometimes just goes crazy so 

378.32 379.14 A: yeah 

382.52 383.30 A: (( mhm )) 

385.39 387.61 A: and did the cat and dog get along 

387.08 388.01 B: (( ah )) 

387.93 399.42 B: yeah they did in specific times like there would be like times where my cat could just walk right by and be fine and then other times if it was trying to protect something like say my dog was eating or had a bone near 

399.33 407.72 B: and my cat was walking by and didn't even realize there was a bone there like she wouldn't really attack she would just kind of like growl and p- know that know that she was trying to protect her 

407.65 416.79 B: food or whatever whereas my cat would say my cat jumped up on like next to us and my dog's trying to get attention from us at the same time my dog would growl 

407.81 408.59 A: yeah 

415.41 416.18 A: yeah 

417.01 419.31 B: stuff like that 

418.94 421.33 A: and you you currently have a rabbit too 

421.29 424.29 B: ah no i did it it's not alive yeah 

422.52 423.50 A: oh you did 

423.60 424.39 A: okay 

424.59 433.76 A: yeah we used to have rabbits when i was little and they're pretty cool um it's it kind of sucks though you can't really keep them in the house too much you know i i guess yours was outside too right 

426.05 427.33 B: yeah 

431.25 432.22 B: yeah 

433.03 441.95 B: yeah that's you know i w- when i was little because i don't have any more i only had one when i was little and i always used to want to let it run around because i was thinking 

438.53 439.28 A: yeah 

441.73 451.23 B: because i knew i was just a little kid so i knew it was like and ah i knew it was animal just like my dog and i always wondered why my dog could always run around the house but my rabbit couldn't 

450.87 452.30 A: right [laughter] 

451.28 453.25 B: (( but so i don't know )) 

453.33 456.51 A: did you ever have a dog and the rabbit um at the same time 

455.92 460.04 B: um yeah actually i did when my when my dog was a puppy but 

460.05 465.64 B: ah we never really put them in the same room just because we knew how m- how protective my dog was and we didn't want anything to happen 

464.54 465.42 A: (( yeah )) 

465.46 469.44 A: i can imagine that a that a dog might just see it as prey or something even the 

468.27 476.68 B: yeah yeah because i know yeah i know my especially a cocker spaniel because they're like supposed to be hunter hunting dogs or used to be hunting dogs so 

475.25 475.98 A: yeah 

476.21 477.82 A: (( yeah )) 

476.99 478.23 B: so like they're 

478.46 483.71 B: it's almost like their instinct to go after rabbits and s- ah birds and such right 

483.18 496.05 A: yeah yeah i i had um we were house sitting another like a friend's dog one time and um my girlfriend had a a parrot it was i think they call it a quaker parrot which is just it's kind of a small one not one of the big ones but 

495.55 496.69 B: right 

496.16 500.22 A: but probably about um i'd say about five or six inches long 

499.73 500.98 B: right 

500.42 515.13 A: and um somehow the bird got out of the cage and within just a few minutes we we weren't at home at the time but the bird got out of the cage and the dog that we were house sitting for just went over to it and just tore it out it was crazy i couldn't believe it 

512.49 513.37 B: (( wow d- )) 

513.58 515.58 B: did it kill it or 

515.16 516.37 A: yeah it killed her 

515.96 516.98 B: wow 

516.54 521.45 A: it probably didn't take that much because i'm sure the bird was kind of fragile compared to the dog 

520.81 522.78 B: c- could the bird fly or 

522.53 527.66 A: yeah well it could fly a little bit but i think sometimes right at first they clip the wings 

524.90 525.84 B: the w- 

527.02 529.21 B: (( yeah yeah that s- that's what i was wondering )) 

528.51 536.10 A: and and she had just gotten it so i think she i think she was going to let the wings grow out but from the pet store they they clip them so 

530.14 531.03 B: right 

532.75 533.62 B: right 

535.29 539.10 B: yeah so they can't fly like they can fly for a few feet but that's about it 

538.26 544.79 A: right right and this dog was i don't know he was a little bit hyper and i don't know just couldn't control itself so 

539.26 540.11 B: yeah 

544.23 545.79 B: right yeah 

545.12 548.39 A: she was she was d- devastated when that happened 

546.69 550.68 B: that's crazy yeah it's p- birds are pretty expensive too 

550.88 559.36 A: yeah i don't remember how much this one was it wasn't it wasn't one of the ones that was you know can get into the hundreds of dollars this one was more like um i think twenty or fifty or something like that 

555.63 556.69 B: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

558.54 572.27 B: yeah one of my friends has you can hear i live like two streets over from him and when i was little i used to go over there and you can hear the birds from like in the summertime you can hear them when their windows are open you can hear their their birds chirping from two streets over 

567.05 567.83 A: uh-huh 

571.97 573.32 A: [laughter] 

572.57 574.91 B: crazy that's that's how many birds they have 

574.99 575.71 A: (( oh )) 

575.47 576.37 B: yeah 

575.74 579.88 A: that's probably those little ones that like the canaries that are some of those little ones 

578.03 585.19 B: yeah yeah they they spend all kinds of money on them his mom loves birds for some reason i don't know 

586.05 594.70 A: i know this one this one that she got um i think you can teach it to talk but we'd only had it about um probably a couple of months 

590.98 591.81 B: yeah 

594.24 595.42 B: right 

594.84 599.89 A: and i think they they don't start learning how to talk until maybe they're six months old or something like that 

599.33 599.95 B: right
