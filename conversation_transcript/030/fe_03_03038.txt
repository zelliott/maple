132.34 140.83 B: so i you know was pregnant with twins so i was quite large and he would lay on my stomach i think because he felt the babies' heart beats and you know

139.23 140.27 A: uh-huh 

141.46 148.34 B: but as soon as i came home with the the kids he was like hey wait you're not paying any attention to me what's up with that [laughter]

210.83 219.10 A: [laughter] yeah i i didn't grow up with cats i grew up with dogs and have always considered myself a dog owning 

213.05 214.07 B: 'cause you get [mn] 

219.31 220.46 A: person 

220.61 226.63 A: and um so getting a cat was was was definitely a wild hair on my part 

225.75 235.91 B: oh they're they're definitely unique individuals every one has its own personality and because we i i grew up on a farm so of course we always had thousands of cats not literally but 

228.29 229.12 A: oh they 

234.76 235.70 A: uh-huh 

236.05 239.73 B: you know if we had less than ten that was unusual 

239.48 241.29 A: mhm makes sense 

240.29 248.66 B: so you know i i'm i'm so used to having 'em but for as many as we've had over the years they're so very very different 

248.40 249.49 A: yeah 

249.10 253.27 B: you know they each have their own little personality and their own little quirks and 

253.47 259.10 A: yeah what's funny is is with the the two puppies that we have that are brother and sister but look nothing alike 

259.25 266.61 A: um there were there were two fath- at least two fathers i think maybe three uh in the whole litter so 'cause they were there were 

263.74 264.79 B: oh wow 

266.75 273.15 A: three distinctly different sets of of puppies in the litter they just looked all different 

271.51 272.76 B: oh my 

273.61 281.83 A: and so we have one puppy the girl that looks like a yellow lab and then the other the other dog we have the male looks like a really fuzzy german shepherd 

281.94 287.33 B: [laughter] funny you should say that we had a we had a dog that looked like a miniature german shepherd 

283.28 285.03 A: and 

287.01 293.46 A: oh fun we have one of those living next door and she looks like a miniature gern- german shepherd it was very weird 

287.99 288.94 B: so 

293.00 297.70 B: but it's easy he was well she was much more like a collie i mean like very 

297.96 302.47 B: very lovable very but just looked like a little miniature german shepherd it was very pleasing 

301.31 302.32 A: oh 

302.45 303.86 A: interesting 

304.00 314.42 A: well bogart the the male we have is is the nicer of the two he is much less aggressive and the minute you if you have to yell at him for doing something he's immediately on his back rolled over 

314.58 317.10 A: you know like oh i'm sorry i'm sorry 

314.91 317.62 B: please don't hurt me [laughter] 

317.25 322.66 A: and and katie is is much more aggressive and you know you yell at her and she's like prove it 

322.73 325.29 A: [laughter] so 

323.19 324.46 B: yeah 

324.48 327.38 B: you know i think i think that's true of most female dogs 

327.41 328.44 B: (( my um )) 

328.68 330.96 B: my mother has a has a 

331.26 333.49 B: a dog he's very 

333.53 339.13 B: she is very unusual but much more aggressive than my brother who has a rottweiler who's a male 

338.97 339.92 A: mhm 

339.52 343.00 B: and is much more playful and 

343.83 345.63 B: and just much less 

345.80 348.55 B: (( psychotic i guess [laughter] that's a good word to use )) 

347.34 348.73 A: [laughter] 

349.28 351.71 B: so my mother's my mother's dog is crazy 

351.80 358.52 A: yeah well my the dog that we had that we we lost both of our dogs they were ten and eleven and we lost both of 'em last year and 

357.89 359.09 B: oh 

358.78 368.15 A: um the female was a sheep dog and she was just she was great i mean she was when we first got her she was a free dog that cost us a lot of money 'cause she had terrible allergies and 

367.68 368.97 B: (( oh that's a shame )) 

368.15 377.54 A: just you know was that when we first got her but but then she kinda mellowed out and grew into this really wonderful guard dog she was a great guard dog 

377.64 383.11 A: and loved to play she she taught our other dog who who was a yellow lab how to play 

383.22 388.10 A: he was just he was so laid back that he didn't really wanna to do anything 

383.30 385.16 B: (( oh that's funny [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

388.31 393.92 A: and so she would she would you know jump on him and pounce on him like a cat and and get him to play 

394.19 395.68 A: and um 

396.26 404.42 A: and i'm seeing kinda the same thing out of out of our our new dogs that that they'll do the same thing the female will will push on the male to play 

405.87 407.48 A: oh they're back 

406.85 408.00 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

408.28 410.32 B: my child is so much fun [noise] 

410.15 411.34 A: (( how old are they )) 

410.54 412.81 B: [laughter] they're four months 

412.72 416.39 A: oh oh that's just like my puppies wow 

414.85 416.01 B: yeah 

416.58 419.10 B: yeah they're just little sprouts [noise]

419.40 420.69 A: oh 

419.74 428.58 B: [noise] but is hot but um [noise] it's funny 'cause the cat he doesn't quite know what to do with 'em yet he looks at 'em he sniffs 'em 

428.72 434.22 B: but he's not quite sure like is this something i'm supposed to play with not play with can i 

434.28 437.21 B: you know 'cause we caught him one day he actually was in the crib 

437.32 438.33 A: oh 

437.50 440.93 B: but he was laying at their feet 'cause like they share a crib

444.66 446.61 A: i don't have a problem with that 

446.02 460.18 B: no i i i didn't either so but he's still like every time they like start to cry or something the cat doesn't know quite what to do he's like um okay wait um is that where's that coming from who who you know like you know are they 

457.41 459.04 A: right 

460.20 465.65 B: you know when they're little and they sorta shake their hands around and stuff he just does not quite know what to do with that 

465.00 467.74 A: oh yeah 

465.75 476.09 B: he's you know he's he wants he wants to play with them but he's also any time he gets even that little glint of look in his eye i'm like get away from the kids [laughter] 

475.26 476.85 A: [laughter] 

476.71 480.53 B: (( so the poor cat's like hey wait i was just trying to play ))

529.53 536.91 A: and she's really mellowed out she's still very playful and she'll play with the puppies which is which is really funny to watch 

537.22 545.01 A: and and i think they we've had the puppies since they were five weeks old yeah way too young and i think they think they're cats 

540.84 541.99 B: oh wow 

545.36 546.59 B: [laughter] 

545.48 551.03 A: um because they they they have so many kitty mannerisms it's it's very interesting but
