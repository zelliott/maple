263.98 265.07 A: yeah 

264.61 270.35 B: big cats and of course um because i wasn't used to them 

270.43 276.28 B: naturally they liked me they always like the one that's the [laughter] and so 

276.53 282.36 B: but then i got used to them and then i would play with them and stuff and then i remember going to sleep 

279.83 280.87 A: mhm 

282.44 284.34 B: and waking up 

284.40 294.81 B: and they must of they they must sense when you're sleeping and when when you're up because as soon as i woke up this cat leapt on the bed

289.44 290.38 A: (( yes )) 

293.99 295.07 A: mhm

300.42 303.28 B: (( yes yeah )) 

303.96 314.98 B: because the whole time i was sleep i don't think they bothered me at all but then as soon as i was awake they just jumped on the bed and i screamed and woke everybody up and everybody was 

307.51 308.63 A: mhm 

313.82 320.85 A: [laughter] [laughter] i don't i understand believe me [laughter] i'm not laughing at you but i can relate

321.02 322.59 A: i've been there 

328.88 329.95 A: yeah 

329.85 332.37 B: but it wasn't traumatic or anything 

331.47 340.90 A: yeah well when you think about pets remember dogs have to be walked cats have a cat box and when it's raining that's a wonderful thing 

335.46 336.31 B: yeah 

336.95 338.27 B: right 

340.67 345.23 B: i can imagine but you know it's funny because um 

342.58 343.80 A: so 

345.50 355.62 B: [lipsmack] i took my son they kinda had a fair nearby and um part of the show one of the shows that they had was snakes and reptiles 

355.06 356.49 A: mhm 

355.93 361.26 B: and so the guy was bringing out all the different pe- um snakes and describing them 

361.15 371.69 B: and then he was talking about the advantage of having a snake as a pet as opposed to a dog and a cat [laughter] and one of the things he was saying is like you said 

365.10 367.46 A: [laughter] 

371.66 378.60 B: a dog you have to walk the dog you have to take him to the vet he has to get shots you have to do all this and 

373.02 374.30 A: mhm 

378.47 390.78 B: then he broke it down to the cat how they have to be fed every day you have to clean out the litter box and then they scratch things and everything and then he went on to the snake and he said 

390.88 393.29 B: you don't have to do anything to the snake 

393.35 399.01 A: yeah but some of 'em eat live animals you gotta feed 'em live animals ew

402.98 404.41 A: (( i don't care )) 

405.93 414.02 A: i had a friend who had one and he ate he kept little mice in his fridge 'cause that seemed cold slowed them down so the snake could get them 

408.60 409.28 B: (( mm )) 

409.72 410.52 B: (( yuck yuck )) 

414.13 414.72 A: (( ew ))
