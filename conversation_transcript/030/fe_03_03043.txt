229.45 232.58 B: really and not dogs and you have a hundred pound dog huh 

232.44 245.51 A: i well you know i think it's i think it's the fact that any dog's controllable you know you can and but a bird is not a- and ah i think when she was real little i think a nanny took her into a um 

233.21 234.59 B: [laughter] 

237.99 238.78 B: right 

245.64 259.33 A: [lipsmack] we had a pet store out by us and it was kind of entertainment to walk up to the pet store you know look around and i think one of these huge parrots really scared her you know squawked and scared her and so ever since then she's been kind of 

250.43 251.47 B: right right 

254.89 256.10 B: (( aha ah )) 

259.16 260.89 B: ingrained in her memory 

259.92 269.87 A: yeah yeah and and her ah boyfriend's mother's real big into parrots and every time she goes over the mother you know the mother has to move all the birds 

269.22 271.57 B: oh no how old is your daughter 

271.16 279.52 A: well she's twenty one but she's mentally challenged and so she's you know twenty one going on about eight mentally so 

274.19 274.97 B: (( oh )) 

278.02 278.98 B: [laughter] 

279.21 280.09 B: cool 

279.54 289.78 A: um but anyway she's a good kid yeah we you know my my um daughter that's still at home spends all the time with the dogs basically i mean the little one is 

281.99 282.98 B: (( excellent )) 

289.92 302.10 A: her dog and and she's you know he's always with her and under her feet wherever she goes and the big one is so big that he spends a lot of time outside he's just kind of like 

294.05 294.88 B: mhm 

302.12 311.22 A: he comes in but he drools and he takes up all this space until you kind of have to you kind of have to pre kramer the house before he's allowed to walk in 

303.94 305.97 B: [laughter] 

306.26 307.49 B: i imagine 

311.15 312.06 B: wow 

311.60 318.63 A: but i've always had dogs you know at least two and sometimes three so yeah so i couldn't live without them 

315.63 316.67 B: wow 

316.85 317.59 B: (( m )) 

318.43 326.54 B: it's really interesting that the topic is pets because i just had this huge fight with my girlfriend over lunch today because she really wants to get a dog 

326.22 327.27 A: yeah 

326.64 328.02 B: and i don't want 

328.03 329.47 A: (( why not )) 

328.24 335.21 B: and she got she well i'm allergic to them and i also ah i worked out in wyoming for a summer 

331.04 331.95 A: (( oh )) 

335.04 344.83 B: and the dogs out there were just amazing and they had all this space to run around and just like you know when i saw when i see that it just you know 

337.42 338.33 A: yeah 

340.05 340.91 A: yeah 

344.93 351.73 B: i i feel like i i live in the city now and i see all these dogs in the city and they're just they're just miserable in the city here 

351.51 360.65 A: well now you shouldn't have seen that because dogs dogs will adapt to whatever their people want them to i mean you don't want to buy a breed like a beagle that's born to run 

353.97 354.68 B: really 

360.49 365.76 B: i can see that this one lady our next door neighbor has like three siberian huskies 

361.17 362.13 A: (( you know )) 

365.27 368.58 A: yeah now that that's not good for an apartment 

368.06 370.35 B: yeah i i can [laughter] 

369.42 374.25 A: but you know like ah and i know this sounds too phoo phoo but like um 

374.29 387.94 A: a little medium sized poodle for example they don't shed people are not allergic to them and they're perfect little dogs for apartments and houses and even though they look kind of phoo phooie they are still pretty smart little dogs you know so 

376.40 378.53 B: (( mm )) 

387.87 390.68 B: oh really well don't tell my girlfriend that 

388.43 389.52 A: yeah 

390.16 393.89 A: oh do you want to tell your girlfriend the only thing i would not like is like 

394.23 395.48 A: (( you know you )) 

395.61 404.32 A: it's not like having a cat where you can leave the house and and if you don't get back for a day or two fine they they eat their food one bite at a time and they use the litterbox 

403.94 404.95 B: right 

404.32 413.52 A: with a dog you have to be there you have to be there in the morning you have to be there at night you have to walk them whether it's snowing or raining or sleeting or hailing or a hundred degrees 

411.84 413.00 B: exactly 

413.53 416.00 B: and we're also moving soon so i kind of 

416.40 419.87 B: you know i'd rather wait until we get settled somewhere then 

417.48 418.66 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

419.56 430.71 A: that's a good idea then wait and see what how much space you're going to have and yeah but from the allergy perspective don't don't be afraid of the poodles because they don't shed and they don't have um 

423.52 425.10 B: yeah exactly 

428.19 429.08 B: really 

430.69 434.81 A: pet dander they're dif i don't know what the deal is with them but 

432.66 433.39 B: (( huh )) 

433.79 441.95 B: yeah she said to me that there was some that there are some that were hypo allergenic or something and i s- i thought i didn't i wonder what types they are 

438.05 439.12 A: yeah 

441.38 448.21 A: well the poodle is one yeah yeah and even if you don't want you know if you're thinking oh well gosh that small one's not 

442.14 443.09 B: the poodle 

448.39 450.92 A: not macho enough well a big

454.39 455.25 B: really 

458.63 459.58 B: (( wow )) 

461.06 467.53 B: well it ended because i told her i said i want a horse really and i said if you let me get a horse then i'll let you get a dog 

466.66 470.28 A: there you go so you need to move out to virginia to like a real

470.33 473.10 A: yeah fairfax county or something and 

472.82 476.28 B: right and i know that's not fair because horses cost 

476.65 480.68 B: ah a lot of money to upkeep and everything

489.13 489.96 B: really 

490.80 491.71 B: wow 

491.26 493.07 A: so it just depends on where you live

507.70 509.19 A: [laughter] 

508.33 512.05 B: and this is just such an annoying little pony that i finally just 

512.14 514.77 B: decided to ah to quit and [laughter] 

513.83 517.32 A: [laughter] that's funny so do you work for the government

521.81 522.95 A: oh okay 

522.39 534.39 B: like in order to have this h- offering trail rides they had like it's funny because it was kind of like this was the only way that they could have board and the boar- horses' board was how they made most of their money 

533.79 535.09 A: oh yeah 

534.33 542.73 B: but there was like a government rule there was like a law in effect that they have a horse center it has to offer trail rides to the the park 

542.44 545.69 A: oh for because it's a national park or something right there yeah
