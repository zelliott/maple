174.58 175.38 B: yeah 

176.69 177.98 B: right 

177.52 179.45 A: and about oh 

179.80 192.53 A: f- ah four years ago we heard from pom rescue finally and they had a dog for us to look at so we drove over and looked at this dog and ah we ended up taking her home and that's how we got the second one 

182.98 183.99 B: yeah 

185.21 186.26 B: yeah 

187.72 188.82 B: yeah 

192.19 194.14 B: well how did you get the third 

193.64 199.71 A: well that's part of the story so the second one is deranged because she was abused 

199.27 200.45 B: (( oh okay )) 

199.83 205.40 A: so she's slightly off she's nuts but she's extremely intelligent and clever 

205.43 210.52 A: and so she just a an amazing dog but a little screwed up mentally 

210.17 213.41 B: well what do you wha- wha- well how's the dogs who are mentally 

213.25 222.22 A: well she was raised as a puppy and left alone a lot in a trailer they told us and she was thrown against the wall by the owner when she ah defecated in the house 

217.30 218.17 B: yeah 

221.80 223.31 B: oh lord 

222.69 229.68 A: yeah so she's like afraid of heights if you pick her up you have to cover her face with your arms so that she feels secure 

225.07 225.91 B: oh 

229.24 230.58 B: (( wow yeah )) 

229.79 233.34 A: or she just shakes and shivers like there's no tomorrow 

231.38 232.57 B: right 

233.02 235.32 B: oh lord wow 

233.84 238.26 A: yeah and she eats feces we can't get her to stop 

237.72 239.01 B: yeah 

238.36 242.26 A: and ah that's fifteen dollars a a thing for the vet 

242.31 251.11 A: you feed it to your other dogs and it's supposed to make their feces so disgusting even this dog won't eat it but it's fifteen dollars a dose and we got three dogs 

247.62 248.50 B: (( ooh )) 

250.81 251.98 B: yeah 

251.29 256.21 A: so it wasn't practical so i go out with a spoon every morning and pick everything up 

255.59 256.47 B: (( ew )) 

256.51 257.63 A: so then 

257.58 270.78 A: our friends up the street had a white pomeranian and they didn't know what to do with this dog and they often had him tied up all day while they were at work outside he was in the hot sun and he was under a tree and they had a bucket of water but you know he just didn't look happy 

265.38 266.37 B: mhm 

270.67 274.39 A: they got divorced and came down to us and said would you like our dog 

275.00 278.09 A: you have two already so we couldn't say no you know 

276.15 277.05 B: yeah 

277.75 278.74 B: yeah 

278.14 279.79 A: so that's how we got the male 

280.28 284.28 B: so you got oh you got two d- d- do you have two females and a male 

283.68 284.95 A: right 

284.45 288.49 B: are they all spayed and neutered like bob barker wants you to have 'em spayed and neutered 

287.89 289.31 A: yes they are 

288.77 291.90 B: that's good so you won't have any accidents 

289.46 290.66 A: yeah 

291.32 292.66 A: no [laughter] 

292.64 294.04 B: yeah 

293.23 295.41 A: but they've become like a pack 

296.10 303.34 A: they have the pack mentality now and they bark incessantly at things that have crossed the street and we can't get them to stop because they encourage each other 

302.96 305.88 B: (( well do ah do your neighbors complain a lot )) 

305.32 309.78 A: no cause my neighbor's got three or five i don't know how many he has 

309.41 310.28 B: oh 

309.99 313.19 A: he has a whole bunch too and his are much noisier than ours 

313.02 316.74 B: there you go so you have a whole neighborhood of pomeranians 

316.18 326.89 A: yeah and across the street we have a terrier and there's another large dog down the street on the other side and there's dog people all around us so we don't have any problems with barking everybody's dogs are barking 

326.91 328.48 B: really 

327.62 329.48 A: we've been pretty lucky that way 

329.93 333.41 B: mm that's good do you have to tie 'em up a lot 

332.65 337.93 A: well we have a dog door and a fenced in yard they can come and go as they please 

337.38 342.61 B: d- do they have strict laws in your i- in in your town about dogs wandering around 

341.98 343.32 A: yes they do 

343.11 347.14 B: in other words if your dog wanders away they can arrest you for having a dog that wanders 

346.55 347.81 A: that's right 

347.29 350.50 B: oh they can have you ever had that problem 

347.98 349.10 A: (( oh yeah )) 

349.85 356.54 A: no we've been pretty good and ah the only problem we had we had one obnoxious neighbor who turned us in for barking dog 

356.77 361.09 B: ah do you mean you mean you can be arrested for having a barking dog 

360.42 362.63 A: yeah we've got a hundred dollar fine 

362.95 364.99 B: you had to pay a hundred dollar fine 

364.40 367.30 A: almost the second notice would have been a hundred bucks 

367.19 368.94 B: what was the first notice 

368.47 370.43 A: ah first notice was a warning 

371.08 373.70 B: so ah ah so what have you done now 

373.28 374.85 A: well they moved away 

374.60 375.90 B: oh that's good 

375.31 379.00 A: yeah [laughter] once they moved away everything was fine again 

376.11 377.57 B: that's good you got the squeal- 

378.62 380.32 B: squealer's moved away 

379.90 380.95 A: yeah 

380.37 382.81 B: yeah well they obviously didn't have any dogs 

382.31 383.94 A: no they didn't 

383.38 386.98 B: so that's so you have to contend with people wh- who don't have dogs 

386.25 391.88 A: well what she had was a cat that came into our yard all the time and that's why the dogs were barking 

389.22 390.45 B: oh okay 

391.30 393.43 B: you should of called her on the cat 

392.85 402.14 A: well i tried and the ju- one judge i talked to said there weren't any laws but you know if somebody shot a cat there's no laws against that either and i thought well that's no answer 

401.83 403.17 B: no that's no 

402.95 407.00 A: he was this was a judge a court judge telling me that i oughta just shoot it 

405.03 406.77 B: right 

406.90 410.81 B: huh way he had the right idea i guess right 

409.45 415.25 A: [laughter] then i'd have been back in his court somebody would of sued me for shooting their cat 

412.52 413.93 B: yeah 

414.67 417.87 B: oh shit you don't want that 

417.09 419.30 A: no i like the cats but you know
