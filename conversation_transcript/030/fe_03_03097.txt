108.11 111.36 B: [laughter] yeah it is actually 

109.89 114.21 A: yeah you only have it for the weekend and then by then the kids are tired of playing with it 

113.62 117.16 B: right no question about that 

114.51 115.32 A: whereas 

116.09 122.28 A: sometimes you get stuck with a dog for twenty years when when the kids get tired of it after six months i guess 

121.89 130.85 B: right well i don't know i've i've had rabbits and i think my parents bought our first rabbit for christmas yeah actually 

122.92 123.98 A: so 

130.44 131.38 A: right 

131.11 132.71 B: i was like nine 

133.37 137.02 B: and i think now this is number nine 

136.78 137.90 A: wow 

137.50 139.19 B: [laughter] 

138.29 140.16 A: so what's the um 

140.31 142.47 A: life expectancy of a rabbit 

142.23 153.01 B: um it depends usually the smaller they are the longer they live like the bigger like lops and have shorter life spans than the smaller like dwarf rabbits 

146.65 147.55 A: uh-huh 

152.67 153.57 A: right 

153.35 156.67 B: um mine right now will be eight in september 

156.14 157.06 A: uh-huh 

157.16 163.45 B: so i mean i've had i i think the longest that we had we had two that lived to nine 

163.20 164.54 A: right 

164.45 165.39 B: (( so )) 

165.52 172.95 B: but they were they pr- were pretty much together most of the time they were sisters they were you know purchased closely together 

172.55 173.39 A: uh-huh 

173.25 177.52 B: i'm like so any other rabbits after that just didn't get along with those two 

177.32 181.20 A: my neighbor had a rabbit and they'd have to clip their teeth i guess 

181.43 182.64 A: (( do you have to do that )) 

182.61 184.05 B: um no 

184.27 185.06 A: (( okay )) 

184.29 185.78 B: no um 

186.38 196.80 B: mainly nails we have to clip his nails but other than that no ah i think that that some rabbits have have that problem where their teeth grow faster than they're supposed to 

196.16 197.00 A: right 

197.33 204.36 B: but i'm like as long as you give them good stuff to chew on they're usually all right 'cause they like to chew on hard stuff 

203.75 204.61 A: uh-huh 

204.85 208.45 B: but i'm like mine he runs around the house all day long 

208.97 214.83 B: we leave him by himself all the time and he likes to come up and hang out on the couch once in a while 

214.66 219.35 A: that's a- amazing do you ah have to get shots for him like a dog 

219.69 220.40 B: (( no )) 

220.20 220.96 A: (( no mhm )) 

220.76 229.14 B: no um most vets don't know anything about rabbits so usually when it comes to to finding out info on him 

229.17 236.16 B: i usually go online and like chat with the breeders because they're the ones that that actually know the rabbits 

230.44 231.35 A: right 

235.87 236.75 A: right 

236.37 239.97 B: i think the vets get one day of rabbits in school 

239.83 240.53 A: hm 

240.40 242.86 B: out the what three years that they're there 

242.43 243.34 A: right 

242.89 245.42 B: they get a whole day on rabbits and that's it 

245.39 250.07 A: what and rabbits are you know it's that un- unusual for people to ha- own rabbits 

250.54 255.27 B: no not really so you'd think that they'd teach 'em a little something but 

251.51 252.39 A: no 

255.51 256.73 A: yeah i mean you would 

255.53 257.08 B: maybe nobody knows 

256.74 259.90 A: you'd think they'd have to have some type of health care 

259.93 262.58 A: on a rabbit like they do cats and um i mean 

260.06 261.23 B: right 

262.87 267.49 A: although you know a rabbit's not gonna bite a child for say i guess 

267.72 272.42 B: well that depends [laughter] i don't know mine likes to bite me once in a while 

268.87 269.72 A: yeah 

272.12 273.04 A: right

357.65 358.57 B: um

362.21 364.69 A: will he run he i guess he won't run away then 

365.06 372.49 B: um well we have decks out in front and out back so we we let him out on the deck all the time he likes that 

370.50 371.32 A: right 

372.38 373.20 A: yeah 

372.64 375.68 B: so he can get some fresh air and some sun and 

376.23 377.87 B: but he's he's 

376.66 378.30 A: and he's safe from other 

378.21 382.65 B: yeah oh yeah but he's not much of an outside bunny 

378.80 379.82 A: other things 

383.40 395.75 B: he doesn't care for it like most of the bunnies that i had they loved to be outside you'd have to chase them around to get them to go back inside when i was little i can picture myself running around the back yard trying to catch a rabbit and it's not fun [laughter] 

389.38 390.43 A: (( that's interesting )) 

394.82 396.79 A: oh no um 

396.14 398.24 B: so yeah 

397.19 411.66 A: when when we were small we had a dog and it was a brittany spaniel and my parents went walking ah in th- in the woods and they were cutting through someone's back yard and did not realise that their bunny rabbit was in a cage 

411.89 414.18 A: and the dog 

414.24 426.57 A: was a bird dog and immediately smelt the rabbit and got underneath the cage wh- while the bunny rabbit got so scared it popped up and it hit the screen on top and got out 

416.39 417.62 B: (( mhm )) 

420.06 421.03 B: right 

426.62 440.50 A: and so my parents were in the back chasing the bunny rabbit trying to catch the bunny rabbit and you know the the dog which was a bird dog actually clamped down on the rabbit and my mum was so afraid that you know he was going to bite it but by nature 

426.90 428.14 B: oh jeez 

440.51 443.48 B: he just picked up and retrieved it yeah 

440.51 442.25 A: that's what he was supposed to do 

442.38 447.59 A: r- right retrieved it and he has a soft mouth and he didn't he didn't hurt it or anything 

443.73 445.05 B: not to kill it 

447.12 448.44 B: (( well that's cool )) 

448.42 449.64 A: (( so ah )) 

448.87 450.21 B: that's unusual 

450.23 451.95 A: yes yes it is 

451.10 454.69 B: als- well my rabbit my rabbit had a run in with a cat once 

454.88 455.83 A: right 

455.54 459.02 B: and i'll tell you i've never seen my rabbit jump that high 

458.76 459.95 A: (( i'm sure )) 

459.62 468.85 B: i mean he literally jumped up and and i'm five nine and he jumped into my chest from the ground and i was like damn 

463.16 464.07 A: uh-huh 

465.51 466.65 A: wow 

468.49 471.01 A: now i would say a cat could do some damage 

471.08 475.73 B: yeah oh yeah he definitely did not like the cat but the cat could never have caught him 

475.49 476.38 A: right 

476.96 484.21 B: cats are not fast enough a dog maybe yeah yeah there is no way a cat's fast enough to catch a bunny 

478.78 479.92 A: oh really 

484.29 485.42 A: (( well that's interesting )) 

484.77 488.17 B: a dog yeah a dog could catch a rabbit if he tried 

487.62 492.82 A: right i guess cats they scoot so fast they appear that like they're running fast 

492.24 493.25 B: right 

493.40 496.97 B: and see that's well the bunnies' protection is to is to dart 

497.01 502.80 B: you know zig zag and stuff that cats they just don't have that kind of speed 

497.63 498.54 A: right 

499.26 500.61 A: they zig zag 

501.81 502.71 A: right 

503.00 504.06 B: so 

504.40 507.08 B: but yeah he- he's a member of the family 

506.90 509.05 A: does he have a name does he have a name 

507.15 508.38 B: pretty much 

508.49 509.53 B: (( buster )) 

509.59 510.69 A: i'm sorry 

510.41 512.47 B: buster like tiny toons 

511.89 513.00 A: (( oh okay )) 

512.65 513.88 B: [laughter] 

515.01 516.35 B: stranger things 

515.02 519.04 A: how many have you stuck with male rabbits versus female rabbits 

519.02 520.85 B: um he's a male 

520.65 521.52 A: okay 

521.23 526.33 B: actually um all the other rabbits that i've ever had were female but he's my first male 

526.28 527.17 A: right 

526.63 534.22 B: they don't sell they don't the reason that it's my first male is 'cause he was breeded they don't they don't sell male rabbits at pet shops 

530.65 531.56 A: right 

534.47 535.29 A: oh 

535.13 538.48 B: they just don't it's it's strange i don't know why but 

538.70 543.40 B: like they don't sell male pets or male rabbits at at the pet shop so 

543.22 546.56 A: do certain breeds ah call for a lot more than others 

547.08 548.15 B: (( um )) 

548.57 550.00 B: (( not usually )) 

549.34 550.21 A: right 

550.01 556.11 B: i mean i would i would say we probably never paid more than thirty five or forty dollars for a rabbit 

555.02 555.79 A: right 

556.53 558.99 B: i'm like but i've come to the decision that 

559.01 563.82 B: that i'm not buying rabbits from pet stores any more that i'm just gonna take like they have um 

563.95 567.99 B: in westchester which is probably about an hour from me they have ah 

568.44 572.36 B: it's kind of a sanction for um 

573.37 576.25 B: it's kinda like an s._p._c._a. for rabbits 'cept they don't kill 'em 

576.08 576.99 A: right 

576.88 582.80 B: which basically you can go up there and for forty bucks up there you can adopt a rabbit that doesn't have a home so 

581.89 582.77 A: (( right uh-huh )) 

583.43 589.08 B: ah i had baby bunnies and they were small and they were nice and cute and stuff but eh 

589.53 591.49 B: every rabbit's gotta have a home 

591.31 593.80 A: this is true this is true well i would think 

592.55 593.83 B: like i feel they 

594.06 597.97 A: the one's that breed probably are healthier than the ones that you get at the pet store 

598.09 599.95 B: [cough] yeah probably
