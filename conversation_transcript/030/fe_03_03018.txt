113.24 114.49 A: uh-huh oh that's 

114.05 124.09 B: um but they're they're really nice they're kind of distant as cats go they don't really like to be picked up [noise] they just sort of if they want you to pet them then they will come to you

126.98 132.40 B: these cats are actually they're about three i've only been living with them for about let's see

145.56 146.83 A: wow 

150.99 151.83 A: uh-huh 

151.60 165.08 B: and they apparently got along from the very beginning and the cats well one of the cats the big fat one actually really loves the dog like sits with it um whenever the dog is sleeping the dog's a girl willow 

164.80 165.67 A: uh-huh 

165.11 173.89 B: whenever willow is sleeping the cat will try and come up to it and hug it and like lick it and stuff it's really super cute yeah 

171.40 183.81 A: oh that's so cute well i'm begetting beginning to think that my cat maybe needs a little friend i mean i'm home a lot but i i sometimes i'm working so much that i don't really have time to play with her and she's 

177.45 179.00 B: yeah 

183.70 188.36 A: she's coming on my desk and sort of wants to sit like on the keyboard and 

187.50 191.33 B: yeah and siamese are so active 

190.97 197.46 A: she is extremely active she's ten years old and she's still extremely playful 

197.06 198.41 B: yeah 

197.61 203.72 A: and really active and well i mean she does sleep a lot like most cats 

203.11 204.31 B: mhm 

203.73 209.55 A: but i don't know that she'd actually get along with another cat that's always been my biggest fear and i don't wanna upset her 

209.27 218.04 B: actually i've heard a lot that siamese cats do not get along well with other cats 'cause they're kinda like one peop- one pet sort of people or pets 

212.89 214.45 A: yeah they don't 

216.74 218.70 A: yeah they're territorial also 

218.09 219.75 B: yeah 

219.12 229.48 A: yeah that's what that's what i figure and i don't know that i i mean at this stage of being the age that she is i don't know if it's a good uh chance to take 

224.09 225.03 B: mhm 

226.11 227.08 B: mhm 

228.79 235.44 B: yeah it's a lot of stress on them um when we got our when i was still living at home when we got our siamese 

235.34 244.26 B: or siamese mixed we actually had a grey tabby that was about um twelve or thirteen years old we weren't really sure we kind of adopted her when she was about two 

244.44 256.50 B: um but she did not adapt well at all to having another cat in the house um yes she was sort of an inside outside cat and the siamese was 'cau- 'cause she we sort of adopted her out of the wild 

248.72 250.36 A: (( [noise] mhm really okay )) 

256.72 259.41 A: and sometimes they try to run away it's i mean they'll 

256.82 257.66 B: and 

259.17 267.94 B: yeah she she spent a lot less time in the house um was just not aggressive but just really distant whenever um 

259.58 260.92 A: they'll take off 

267.98 273.04 B: whenever the siamese was inside she wouldn't wanna come inside wouldn't want to come and play with us 

272.89 277.66 A: oh wow that's so interesting well i mean i'm hoping that [noise] 

273.46 274.41 B: yeah 

274.87 276.11 B: yeah 

277.68 285.61 A: i mean everyone keeps telling me don't take the chance um not not always good to bring in another cat into the mix so 

284.18 285.37 B: mhm 

285.89 286.78 A: um 

285.94 288.22 B: especially since she's older 

287.61 293.22 A: yeah especially i mean i would have needed to have done it a long time ago if i was going to 

291.42 292.81 B: yeah 

292.97 294.22 B: (( yeah )) 

293.30 300.56 A: give her another cat friend [laughter] at this point in time i don't think she's gonna get another one [laughter] 

295.37 296.64 B: yeah 

299.15 300.87 B: yeah [laughter] 

300.74 304.79 A: but i've i grew up with a lot of animals and stuff so i 

304.73 305.54 B: mhm 

304.95 310.19 A: i just sort of miss being surrounded by a lot of animals 'cause we had horses what's that 

307.60 309.81 B: yeah what kind of animals 

310.05 311.87 B: what what kind of animals 

311.32 319.29 A: we had horses and uh goats i grew up on sort of like a semi farm ranch 

315.17 316.04 B: wow 

318.94 320.39 B: (( wow )) 

319.62 329.89 A: and i mean he had just a lot of animals growing up like tons of just dogs and cats and chickens and you know turkeys and i know it was amazing 

321.96 323.04 B: mhm 

326.84 328.62 B: that's really cool 

330.16 338.82 A: it really was and i would i would really love to have um horses again that would be really great but you know i live in new york city so 

336.15 337.53 B: mhm 

338.79 340.23 B: oh [laughter] 

339.62 343.02 A: i don't think that's possible [laughter] [laughter] 

341.15 343.12 B: yeah a little difficult 

343.12 352.88 B: i actually live somewhere where uh we have a humongous yard um i don't think we would exactly have horses we're not really horse people um 

347.65 348.52 A: uh-huh 

352.81 364.28 B: i've pretty much almost always lived not in the city but sort of in the suburbs but we could have a bunch of dogs but unfortunately i really don't like dogs that much um 

357.26 358.25 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

364.25 368.50 A: well dogs require a lot of uh maintenance and attention also 

367.60 373.92 B: they're really like having like another child it's really cra- well not that i have any kids but it 

370.31 371.40 A: yeah 

373.14 376.21 A: yeah but i agree i mean they require a lot of attention 

375.54 380.64 B: mhm and the dog that they have is a vishler which is like a 

376.51 377.07 A: (( [noise] )) 

380.82 383.82 B: sort of a hungarian hunting dog 

383.37 384.37 A: right 

383.76 393.30 B: and they have really short fur and they're really attention craving like they're really they really want to be with people all the time and when i was growing up um 

390.60 391.34 A: (( mm mhm )) 

393.24 394.57 B: we sort of lived 

394.46 401.99 B: further out in the suburbs and we had a garden and almost always had a dog um but they were outside pets they never came inside 

401.89 415.25 B: um you know we played with them bunches and they were definitely family pets but they stayed outside and this is the first experience i've had with living in a dog living with a dog that lives inside and i just i really don't care for it i think dogs are 

411.66 412.72 A: mhm 

415.10 419.36 B: well she's kind of big um about seventy pounds 

418.78 420.04 A: oh god 

419.45 420.72 B: yeah 

420.14 422.27 A: they have an odor to them too 

422.58 425.11 B: yes yes 

422.64 430.59 A: i mean they do i mean cats cats don't i mean cats have a lot of hair but they don't produce the same odor that dogs have 

429.80 433.84 B: the funky dog smell [laughter] yeah 

431.16 444.16 A: yeah [laughter] it's a really funky dog smell i mean you can you can definitely in my building where i live there are a couple of people that have dogs and every now and again when they've walked them after it's rained i can smell it and i 

434.81 436.03 B: yeah 

438.56 439.54 B: mhm 

443.26 445.07 B: yeah 

444.02 447.22 A: i can smell it in the hall and i can smell it in the elevator it 

446.56 447.83 B: (( yep )) 

447.24 450.31 A: just go- it has that wet doggy smell that 

449.56 458.35 B: and i'm i'm not exactly a clean freak but i do like to keep it a little clean and like everytime it rains we have to mop like the entire house and 

458.32 467.18 B: um we uh since i've moved in we laid down a lot of rules because she's also not very well disciplined which i think makes a difference with dogs 

458.89 459.99 A: (( [noise] )) 

466.93 467.78 A: true 

467.36 473.24 B: b- because they really need someone like always telling them not what to do but sort of keeping an eye on them 

472.80 473.91 A: right 

473.30 487.12 B: and given like a split second chance she'll go i- if she's soaking wet she'll run into our room and lay down on the clean sheets and bedspreads and everything and we have to wash everything 

478.39 479.25 A: mhm 

483.03 485.47 A: oh no [laughter] 

486.40 490.02 A: oh no that's terrible 

487.27 488.34 B: yeah 

488.78 492.46 B: that's her favorite place to be when she gets wet for some reason 

492.35 494.66 A: (( [laughter] )) 

492.48 504.59 B: so since i've moved in i've sort of cut that out and we keep our door closed most of the time 'cause she's not very well behaved and i don't know it's always hard to have upholstered furniture with dogs 

495.56 496.89 A: [laughter] 

500.39 501.74 A: yeah 

504.21 506.47 A: yeah i can imagine 

504.69 505.66 B: they're just 

506.08 518.47 B: very hard on it and like we had to get rid of the sofa because she spent a lot of time on it it wasn't really her favorite seat but enough time on it to wear i don't think we were ever gonna get the dog smell out 

518.07 520.35 A: oh no 

518.94 524.42 B: yeah so but it it you know we were remodelling anyway so we just kind of put in some new furniture 

524.36 525.44 A: [laughter] 

524.65 529.78 B: but now she's adopted the next furniture and we try and keep a blanket over it but 

529.79 531.65 B: (( i don't know it just )) 

530.48 538.91 A: yeah it is it is really it's really difficult i mean i've contemplated also getting um a dog a couple of years ago 

533.68 534.76 B: mhm 

538.48 539.63 B: yeah 

538.92 544.86 A: uh with my boyfriend and i and we thought well maybe we'd get like a mid sized small dog 

544.41 545.67 B: yeah 

544.89 552.20 A: and we were looking at maybe getting a terrier but we'd [noise] heard from so many people after doing a lot of research that apparently they get 

552.21 565.12 A: um [noise] suicidal if they're not run enough [noise] yeah and i didn't i didn't know that about terriers but apparently they just have this innate need to run and [noise] and also they like to [noise] 

555.71 557.23 B: really 

562.25 563.89 B: wow 

565.16 573.01 A: sort of run after cats so [laughter] it seemed like the wrong choice after that we just said [noise] you know what maybe we better not um 

566.81 568.54 B: yeah 

569.40 570.28 B: [laughter] 

573.13 579.29 A: get a dog for now [noise] i you know who knows what kind of personality type they're gonna be carrying with them so 

574.81 576.22 B: yeah 

577.94 579.20 B: yeah 

579.65 584.12 B: i think that's another thing i think if cats don't like you they just sort of do their own thing 

583.49 584.89 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

584.24 591.30 B: but if dogs don't like you or you don't get along well with your dog it can be really unhappy 'cause they need so much attention 

587.80 588.58 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

588.65 590.05 A: (( yeah )) 

590.58 599.95 A: exactly i mean i had another friend that um has had her dog for maybe about six or seven [noise] years and he's extremely comfortable in the city 

596.34 597.55 B: mhm
