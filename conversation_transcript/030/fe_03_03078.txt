444.12 444.94 A: (( mm )) 

445.05 456.90 B: and ah i said what what's the prognosis and he said not good i can give her this i can give her that well if she's going to die let her die quietly at home you know so we're waiting on her she wa- she to see if she's going to recover or not 

456.72 461.41 A: yeah that's sad i mean i've been through a lot of pet deaths [laughter] i've been through at least 

461.81 465.77 A: two that got hit by a car and that got out 

464.20 465.63 B: yeah

470.08 471.46 A: had to pick one off 

471.53 479.92 A: pick one up off the highway it wasn't damaged i think someone must have kept her and she died in their in their care but we could we put signs up and stuff 

479.63 487.36 B: [mn] i thought people if you don't want an animal don't just throw them out this is not like a bag of trash you can just throw away it's a it's a living thing you 

488.59 489.80 B: know i guess it 

488.79 492.76 A: i don't know some people shouldn't eve have kids let alone pets i mean what are you going to do 

492.52 495.84 B: i'll tell you what i've seen people who should not have had children 

496.01 497.75 B: i got in trouble one day um 

497.87 504.22 B: i'm ex marine and ah i'm six foot three i was six foot three but i shrank when i had chemo 

500.12 500.92 A: (( okay at )) 

504.48 508.26 B: um this woman slapped her kid like halfway across the store 

508.39 509.99 B: just backhanded her 

510.00 519.25 B: and i was like don't you ever hit a child like that who are you i'm your worst enemy you got a problem don't slap a child like that no no way 

519.89 527.35 B: you know discipline's one thing but beating someone's another thing it's like with dogs and cats the same way it's like if you don't want want an animal get rid of it 

528.43 529.33 B: so 

529.10 532.00 A: least put it in a shelter don't just leave it on the street 

530.77 533.66 B: yeah there's operation kindness down here which 

532.42 535.85 A: i don't know what happened to my dog she didn't have a collar or anything and no one 

536.31 542.36 A: no one claimed her i d- i kept her and just called the s._p._c._a. i didn't like take her to the s._p._c._a. 

543.13 551.46 A: but my buddy was a vet was going to vet school so he was able to do things for her and get her shots and get her spayed he did the surgery himself 

548.14 549.21 B: yeah 

551.27 557.08 B: that's right people you have them spayed or neutered okay it's instinct just like us 

552.25 553.13 A: actually 

557.33 559.43 B: the need to breed 

560.26 562.44 B: appropriate the earth 

563.10 574.93 A: but if you're not going to breed your dog i mean i was read there's lots of health there's good health benefits of doing that but it also makes it well obviously a little less more calm you don't have to worry about going into cycle or estrus every twice a year 

568.01 569.35 B: yeah there is good health 

574.43 577.36 B: yep unbelievable 

576.07 578.92 A: i mean it reduces chances of cancers and stuff 

579.35 580.37 A: so 

581.17 594.64 B: yeah i wonder you know people once you have a little common sense with um a an animal you know a dog is your best friend that little chihuahua i had little mixed terrier and chihuahua was the best friend i ever had i mean 

594.60 597.15 B: just you couldn't ask for anything any better 

597.63 599.89 B: the stuff that she you know she worked cheap [laughter]
