53.22 56.28 A: yeah right they do that people drop them off 

56.13 62.68 B: yeah um my actually my son had found it um he was visiting the uh local y. center 

62.23 63.38 A: oh okay 

62.88 68.43 B: and ah found it there and ah and then as a p- it was a very young as a puppy 

68.17 69.13 A: yeah 

68.50 75.38 B: and ah and brought it home and then and then it just and it just no just stayed 

72.72 74.16 A: just didn't go away 

74.80 76.93 A: (( yeah i know the feeling )) 

75.45 78.23 B: and ah took care of it and and um 

78.58 79.43 B: (( ah )) 

78.68 81.17 A: my my sister in law 

81.47 89.16 A: is she's a young girl she's probably twenty now and she used to have a pet turtle and i asked my wife at the time how can you have a turtle for a pet 

84.31 85.19 B: mhm 

88.63 90.02 B: [laughter] 

89.36 97.05 A: you know i mean all they really do is eat lettuce and but she said well you know they can show love too and i thought no they can't 

91.94 93.06 B: right 

96.39 98.02 B: no yeah 

97.14 100.85 A: but ah this dog of course a dog is probably 

101.49 104.98 A: for most people is probably the ideal pet he's um 

105.12 116.56 A: a a light black lab and he's got something else in him 'cause his head structure's not the same as as th- a general black lab but he's a a really intelligent dog 

111.14 112.17 B: mhm 

113.50 114.69 B: right 

116.10 117.49 B: mhm 

116.93 120.96 A: and ah we've all just really fallen in love with him 

120.29 122.11 B: now now do you have kids 

121.91 125.48 A: no well i did i mean i'm fifty six years old so 

125.00 128.62 B: oh okay so they're you're you- yeah 

126.44 132.38 A: they're gone yeah i've got one son he's he's moved out some time ago so 

130.59 133.57 B: (( mm i see so i was goin- )) 

132.83 134.86 A: and he's got cats too 

134.98 149.85 A: so in fact the reason we first got cats was because of my son's love for cats and we had a german shepherd at the time and he said as soon as the german shepherd dies can i get a cat and my wife said yeah i guess so 

142.00 143.04 B: mhm 

149.51 150.55 B: mhm 

149.93 153.09 A: and we ended up with a cat and i didn't like cats 

152.56 159.78 B: [mn] neither do i i i mean well i mean ah you now you're probably now you're probably different about it but 

156.12 157.76 A: i know what you're talking about 

159.26 164.98 A: yeah i am yeah i am they they're a lot more independent they're not as dependent on people 

160.08 160.91 B: but 

164.86 167.03 B: right right ah 

166.04 171.54 A: as a as a dog is and they're not as ah they're lovable 

171.41 173.01 B: right 

172.47 183.01 A: and they're just they're kind of independent and in fact ah from what i understand they're still not really considered tame animals they're still kind of considered wild 

174.99 175.92 B: right 

182.57 183.89 B: are you serious 

183.36 197.20 A: yeah so and they're not in fact if you i don't know how religious you are and and and i'm not particularly religious but i've studied a little bit and there's no mention of cats in the bible which is kind of ironic because 

184.50 185.59 B: now who said 

188.44 189.41 B: very 

189.86 190.76 B: okay 

197.22 200.42 A: um egypt that was one of their deities 

200.50 201.73 B: right 

201.13 209.52 A: yeah and it's not mentioned in the bible and you know i mean if you look in the bible in the back part of it there's no mention of cats 

209.95 210.98 B: i wonder wh- 

210.09 214.42 A: which doesn't make sense well evidentially they weren't domesticated yet 

214.88 216.67 B: oh 

216.22 218.09 A: when the bible was written 

218.84 224.36 B: now i thought that they ah now i i could have sworn ah um 

224.52 226.63 B: that in 

227.38 236.62 B: seeing you know some you know maybe like the history channel or something like that and looking at s- 

236.65 238.12 B: (( some ah )) 

239.73 242.19 B: looking at some um 

242.27 245.69 A: so- like the hieroglyphics and stuff yeah they do have cats 

243.24 244.55 B: yes 

245.22 246.35 B: right 

245.73 250.53 A: yeah they do and that should correspond to the time that the jews were in israel 

250.66 252.56 A: or i mean in ah egypt 

252.20 253.54 B: right 

253.20 266.80 A: and i don't un- i don't understand it myself and you can double check me on this 'cause you're obviously on the internet and you may want to double check me 'cause i could have my facts wrong but i think i'm right on this i think that ah cats are not mentioned in the bible at all 

258.82 259.98 B: right 

265.86 270.07 B: wow that's interesti- i mean i i think that's a very interesting fact 

267.26 268.14 A: so 

269.68 270.96 A: i thought so 

270.29 272.63 B: i mean you know a little bit of information 

271.27 281.01 A: i just ran across it in and i didn't double check it i ran across it the other day and i thought yeah i might keep this in my brain 'cause i might want to use it one of these days 

276.14 277.32 B: mhm 

279.22 280.77 B: [laughter] 

280.81 283.38 B: now now where abouts in tennessee do you live 

282.82 285.87 A: i live in north west tennessee um 

286.44 288.51 A: between memphis and nashville 

286.47 287.38 B: nor- 

288.46 290.70 B: between memphis and na- 'cause w- 

289.52 294.45 A: yeah i live in the i live twenty miles roughly from the kentucky border 

294.79 297.68 A: so right close to the kentucky lake 

294.98 296.51 B: oh

315.61 316.68 B: mhm 

318.02 320.42 A: geographically they're quite different 

320.17 321.31 B: mhm 

320.87 322.36 A: and ah but 

321.59 326.81 B: you mean as far as um you know j- a- as far as looking at the terrain you mean 

325.00 329.31 A: th- okay yeah yeah exactly east tennessee's mountains 

329.05 330.04 B: right 

329.39 339.04 A: ah middle tennessee's relatively hilly and when you come onto the west end it's still hilly but it's a lot more gentle hills and a lot more level ground 

338.40 339.55 B: (( oh okay )) 

339.28 346.66 A: so yeah we can do probably we could probably farm more of our our area than the east tennessee people can

346.53 348.13 B: (( oh i see oh )) 

347.42 351.78 A: you know it's because we've got a lot more of level land but um

565.49 566.46 A: you know 

566.88 570.87 A: it gives them three or four years however long they enlist for to determine 

570.32 571.20 B: yeah

572.69 587.28 B: yeah um i i i tell you i was ah i was a little bit against it when he was coming out of high school a matter of fact i was very much against it and because because um he's very intelligent and he had a scholarship for
