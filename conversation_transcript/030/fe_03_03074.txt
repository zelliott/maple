155.30 157.01 A: that's interesting 

156.17 166.36 B: yeah so he's a pretty good animal then we also have two cats ah both of them are outside cats one is a long haired tabby and the other one is a short haired russian gray 

162.07 162.63 A: (( [cough] )) 

166.56 168.24 B: ah they're both females 

168.48 175.30 B: um the long haired tabby is a long haired calico is what she actually is she's probably 

175.33 177.92 B: i think i've had her for about thirteen years 

178.19 179.11 A: hm 

178.33 191.05 B: um so she's pretty well mature she used to be a fire cat a real killer you know always leaving dead animals on the porch and what not chasing off dogs ah and just in the last three years she's mello- mellowed out intensely um 

190.40 192.12 A: did you say she's thirteen 

191.76 193.44 B: yeah 

192.78 198.58 A: [noise] yeah that's a at about ten we find they start mellowing quite a bit yeah 

197.06 203.12 B: yeah so that's about right about ten is when she when she started to chill out and she'd get in your lap she'd actually come and 

202.07 204.27 A: how many teeth does she have left 

203.57 205.09 B: she has them all 

204.41 205.87 A: she's got all her teeth 

205.24 208.27 B: mhm yeah she's in really good health 

206.00 206.79 A: (( uh )) 

208.55 216.00 B: um and she starts now she'll seek you out and you know get on your lap and we'll pet her and you know we take her for an annual checkup 

216.13 218.18 B: um and the other one 

218.30 226.07 B: is very loving very little cat it followed us home when it was about nine weeks old it chased my dog all the way home and stalked it has absolutely no fear 

226.34 228.90 B: um we used to spend all kinds 

226.84 231.91 A: [laughter] well he stalks the this one stalks or she rather stalks the pit bull 

231.51 235.53 B: yeah he followed her for five blo- followed my dog for five blocks 

235.62 241.75 B: and would jump out from underneath cars and goose him on his belly and then dart on yeah followed us for five blocks home 

238.25 239.50 A: boy oh boy 

240.08 244.25 A: doesn't she know he could snap her in two with one snap of his jaws 

243.24 248.07 B: ah yeah but i don't think she cares she does it with everything 

245.77 246.46 A: (( [laughter] i )) 

246.96 249.74 A: guess she's got a he's got to catch her first doesn't he 

249.18 259.80 B: yeah well she'll i mean she's plays it's playful you can i guess she puts off that sense that it's playful so the dog doesn't really get aggressive i mean she never hisses or rears up her fur 

259.81 266.87 B: um very nice cat we used to spend lots of time with her until about two months ago she got hit by a car 

265.94 267.27 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

266.99 268.59 B: yeah and it um 

268.42 279.25 B: broke her tail right on the inside um right before it exits the body so it severed the nerve that controls her bladder and her rectum 

273.67 274.29 A: [cough] 

277.80 278.37 A: (( [cough] )) 

279.08 285.59 B: so we have to leave her outside and you know so that because she's not no longer trained to use a litter box 

283.89 286.68 A: no that d- that would not be cool 

286.16 291.47 B: no and it's not and we're giving her the benefit of the doubt and we're hoping that it's going to 

291.30 302.35 B: rectify itself ah but with her we used to i mean she used to sit in our laps and fall asleep for hours i mean my wife would be working at the computer and lala would be sitting in my wife's lap for like two hours 

301.73 303.31 A: i'll be darned 

302.72 316.89 B: yeah so now with the cats we probably spend maybe a half hour a day with them maybe because whenever we're outside they'll come round we'll pet them and then they'll wander off and do their own thing mhm 

309.00 309.56 A: (( [cough] )) 

314.20 317.46 A: do their thing go catch some vermin or whatever they want to do 

317.12 322.28 B: right and yeah so they're nice and then on top of that we have fish tanks [lipsmack] 

318.41 319.43 A: wow 

323.07 326.04 B: so i don't know if those are actually considered pets or not 

324.95 326.45 A: [cough] well i think so 

326.28 340.25 B: well they might be but um i used to raise and breed sicklids until i had children and ah i only kept my large breeding pair of red tears which were the male was probably about seventeen inches long 

340.09 342.73 B: and the female's about eleven 

343.24 350.51 B: and my kids really like them they'd get up on the tank you know the fish would come up and look at them and all that [cough] and they passed away shortly ago 

350.57 360.28 B: so i've replaced them with all kinds of little you know like tetras and neons ah bedas you know just the little frilly fish that you walk up and they scatter and go everywhere 

359.69 361.66 A: yeah but they're colorful 

361.11 372.06 B: oh yes they're colorful and they're shiny and they're you know everytime you move they move [cough] so the kids like it they can have their fun and then the only other one i saved was my piranha which i've had for the last 

371.38 372.68 A: (( a piranha )) 

372.19 374.14 B: mhm i've had him for seven years 

373.12 373.70 A: (( [cough] )) 

374.27 375.28 A: you you 

375.29 379.25 A: you're the only guy i've ever heard of with a pit bull and a piranha 

378.49 379.88 B: (( [laughter] )) 

380.10 387.48 B: yeah i have a red bellied piranha he's about seven years old i got him in ninety six 

387.77 390.85 B: i believe it was ninety six it was early ninety six got him when he was 

389.78 391.55 A: they live pretty long then 

391.11 394.84 B: oh yeah they they'll live for a long time i got him when he was a half inch long 

394.54 395.95 A: hm 

394.88 403.08 B: and now he's about ni- eight and a half inches long beautiful looks like ah looks like liquid mercury when he swims through the water 

399.54 400.89 A: i'll be darned 

403.01 405.68 A: wow does he he doesn't eat your other fish 

403.52 405.19 B: yeah 

405.34 407.14 B: well i have him in his own tank 

406.50 407.69 A: oh okay 

407.17 409.03 B: yeah i don't put him with anything else 

408.89 412.97 A: [cough] i was going to say you'd think he'd get hungry and make a meal for himself 

409.72 411.33 B: (( yeah )) 

412.41 416.99 B: and he would and he most definitely would and the kids like him as well and the fish ah 

415.93 417.25 A: what do you feed him 

417.12 420.54 B: i just feed him fish food i used to feed him live fish 

418.71 420.29 A: just 

420.59 431.76 B: ah and then the quality of the feeder fish around here started to slack and since i've i've never had any diseases in any of my tanks and i didn't want to run the risk of him getting sick so i just started feeding him regular 

424.09 424.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

429.49 431.16 A: yeah 

431.26 433.98 A: i thought that maybe you'd give him chicken or something 

432.49 440.79 B: food no you don't have to you just they'll live just fine off regular fish food as long as it's made specifically for carnivorous fish like sicklids are 

436.26 437.12 A: (( huh [laughter] )) 

440.94 451.20 A: i i i had no idea wow well you have quite a ah an entourage of of of ah animals there that's really something
