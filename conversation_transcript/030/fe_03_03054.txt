98.22 107.22 B: which i always felt guilty about when i h- ah when i had my other cats because i got them as kittens and had them declawed and i mean 

107.05 117.92 B: i know i read about you really shouldn't it's like cutting off fingers but ah without doing that without declawing them i really couldn't have the cats because i value my furnishings too 

117.59 121.76 A: (( yeah your furniture and your floor you know if you have hardwood floors i mean they'll scratch that up )) 

121.38 134.17 B: well yeah i mean i've seen ripped up furniture you know where cats ah exercise their claws they don't do it maliciously it's a form of exercise that's why they have sc- ah scratching posts when they have claws and y- and then you hope they use them 

127.95 128.96 A: yeah 

134.51 136.46 A: [laughter] true true 

136.27 141.37 B: right ah and the let's see well what where the questions i spend about ah 

141.26 155.38 B: oh maybe over the day about an hour with them i used to be a lot better about brushing them daily now if i get to it once every four days or five days it's a lot but they're both short hairs but i know my house is full of cat hair because of 

147.86 148.57 A: (( yeah )) 

155.35 164.00 B: fr- some friends of mine came over and her husband was wearing black pants and while she and i did our thing he was sitting reading the paper on the couch and when he got up 

163.93 172.78 B: his seat in the back and the trouser legs were full of cat hair and yeah you really can't see it a lot because my couch is kind of a beigey 

166.85 167.99 A: uh-huh oh no 

172.86 175.11 B: two tone beigey tweed 

174.71 175.68 A: right 

175.21 179.75 B: so you know and and they d- even if you vacuum every day 

179.69 187.07 B: the hair kind of winds itself into the fabric i don't know so i've been lax about vacuuming the 

186.95 197.19 B: the cushions because i don't care i i do know i have a two or three pair of black slacks and when i have to go out if i'm dressed before i'm aware for me to lay a towel down 

187.31 188.16 A: right 

197.11 204.25 B: wherever i'm sitting [laughter] i mean you your life changes to some degree when you have pets it's really like having children 

197.65 199.03 A: right [laughter] 

204.35 205.47 B: but cats 

204.49 206.48 A: i i'll bet it is i bet it is 

206.13 216.63 B: well it's it's a different kind of responsibility i mean ah ah cats are very clean you don't have to walk them ah i keep mine indoors i'm afraid to let them outdoors because 

216.65 222.00 B: one they can get struck by a car two they can get lost i mean there's a million reasons 

221.19 225.12 A: mhm d- do you live like in a in a big neighborhood or like in a rural more rural area 

224.42 228.96 B: well yeah i live in nashville tennessee and i live in a condominium complex 

226.83 227.69 A: okay 

228.64 230.03 A: right okay 

229.20 242.98 B: and and ah i don't you know like every once in a while i see a cat wandering outside and and they may soil not that the lawn belongs to me but you know people who let pets run loose are really for the birds you know 

242.73 243.63 A: (( mhm )) 

242.86 253.78 B: because the cats will s- you know they'll defecate or urinate and if you're trying to grow a nice lawn or flowers that can be kind of hard ah but i'm more concerned with the cats' safety so i keep them in 

253.91 254.72 A: right 

254.01 259.76 B: ah and ah i was going to tell you something else about indoor no i don't remember what i was going to say 

259.02 262.75 A: well i i do have a question is it do you find it harder to um 

262.77 270.09 A: to maintain like you know some sort of level of cleanliness within in the house or w- you know ar- like around yourself because you have pets or 

269.71 279.05 B: no i don't because cats oh that's what i wanted to tell you cats don't have to be walked like dogs and they're very clean their mother usually teaches them 

279.10 286.94 B: ah cat cats kittens are adoptable at about six weeks before that they're with their mother d- you don't know anything about cats right 

282.66 283.52 A: right 

286.66 287.72 A: yes i do 

287.42 292.43 B: all right then you may know this but the mother teaches them how to cover 

292.51 295.35 B: their ah feces and their urine 

295.70 296.50 A: uh-huh 

295.75 298.60 B: with a with a assuming they're indoor cats you know 

298.04 298.92 A: uh-huh 

298.67 303.40 B: and use a litter box and the mother can teach the babies so they're they're trained when you get them 

303.47 307.75 B: and cat do you know why cats bury their waste i bet you don't know 

306.90 309.19 A: (( why why do they no i don't )) 

309.26 312.59 B: yeah this is supposed to be a nice little bit of information for you 

312.70 314.80 B: cats are felines 

315.07 315.90 A: uh-huh 

315.14 321.23 B: ah lions and tigers and ah leopards and you know cheetahs they're all 

321.53 326.44 B: felines and and in the wild they bury their waste so that 

326.69 332.20 B: ah any predators cannot sniff to find out that they've been there 

332.79 337.45 B: in other words they hide their waste they're really doing it for self preservation 

332.89 333.95 A: (( oh okay )) 

337.89 346.56 B: and i was kind of delighted to learn that fact many many many years ago you know it made sense as to why [cough] excuse me cats cover their waste 

346.31 351.18 A: mhm that's interesting you know how they're like because they're related to the lions and you know the wild 

347.00 348.37 B: it's just 

350.46 352.95 B: yeah well they're all felines they're all from the 

351.77 354.16 A: and they have the same characteristics like that 

353.78 355.16 B: exactly 

354.25 356.58 A: (( it's instinctfully really huh )) 

355.82 367.89 B: and you know people make a big mistake that ah people who don't like cats say oh they're not friendly you know like dogs they don't come when you call them well they're trying to make a cat into a dog i love dogs too and i love 

367.78 381.91 B: that a dog comes when you call it but cats are very independent they'll just sit and stare at you when you call them or they'll turn their back on you with their rear end toward you i mean they're they're very delicious animals you you just have to understand them 

373.89 374.84 A: yeah 

375.75 376.79 A: [laughter] 

381.77 386.68 B: and i heard a couple of sayings i think i can remember one when you call a dog 

386.77 391.31 B: he he comes right away when you call a cat they 

391.75 394.08 B: you leave a message and they get back to you 

393.48 395.15 A: [laughter] 

394.34 406.04 B: something like that [laughter] but it's so true they are so they're just you just have to one has to understand that cats and dogs are not the same totally i mean 

396.63 398.11 A: [laughter] 

399.36 400.19 A: yeah 

405.16 408.00 A: yeah cats are much more independent they're much more independent 

407.57 416.23 B: well they don't th- they can they will love you but they don't show it like a dog does a cat will come occasionally and rub himself against you 

416.11 416.96 A: uh-huh 

416.59 426.04 B: ah you know and purr or lie down next to you ah neither of my cats are lap cats particularly but ah my first cat is is not 

426.46 431.52 B: i mean he's not affectionate at all but i know he is because he'll rub his head on me once in a while but the second 

431.89 442.91 B: will lay next to me when i watch television in bed you know he'll curl up and go to sleep next to me and then he'll go and do his thing and then when i shut the light out no matter when i turn the light out to go to sleep 

437.16 438.11 A: right 

442.81 454.30 B: no matter what that second cat is doing or where she is she comes and finds me and lays down against me again to go to sleep with me so they you see you h- you just have to understand that a cat is different 

449.26 450.29 A: (( oh [mn] )) 

454.10 455.02 A: uh-huh 

454.65 466.94 B: most people you know love dogs ah because they are so friendly but cats i mean ah dogs are herd animals and cats are loners dogs traveled in packs many many many many years ago 

466.77 473.87 B: cats never did well ah actually that's wrong in terms of lions lions ah there's ah 

473.08 474.38 A: (( uh-huh they travel in )) 

473.91 476.43 B: their prides they have a pride right 

474.43 475.78 A: (( prides yeah )) 

477.06 483.05 A: that's interesting yeah the dog does do i mean when i think about it they do actually travel in packs i'd never thought about it like that 

481.39 482.75 B: right 

482.79 496.58 B: and that and ah dogs depend on they need man's friendship a cat really doesn't yes he depends on you for food and keeping his litter clean and i'm really great about that that litter box gets cleaned out every single day 

496.35 497.31 A: [laughter] 

496.88 505.67 B: because if it doesn't i mean ah if you go two or three or four days without cleaning it out a cat is very fastidious and he will deposit 

505.74 510.37 B: his bowels somewhere else c- because he won't go in- 

509.17 511.20 A: (( yeah )) 

510.66 523.23 B: right and anytime does it a cat puts his waste either urine or bowels somewhere other than the litter books box he is giving you a message either he is not feeling well or the litter box is dirty 

523.50 524.33 A: uh-huh 

523.90 528.01 B: so they can communicate in their way you just have to be able to read them 

528.33 532.22 B: but i like them because they're really a low a very low maintenance animal 

532.23 533.08 A: uh-huh 

532.32 539.57 B: i mean ah if i had to get out three hundred and sixty five days a year twice or three times a day to walk a dog no way 

539.88 540.77 A: [laughter] 

540.30 546.02 B: but the cat doesn't have to go out ever it's really self contained under my roof and i like that 

546.90 549.00 B: so anymore questions for me 

548.64 556.46 A: well i i actually learned have learned a lot just by talking talking to you because i've heard like both sides of the story like when people say you know it's more work with cats just ah 

556.69 561.83 A: they're not as friendly and you wa- like people that want that kind of a friendly animal they they you know 

561.07 563.96 B: if they want a friendly animal do not get a cat 

564.16 567.02 A: yeah and i'm i'm learning that i'm learning that yeah 

564.30 578.65 B: i mean they j- they just don't they don't understand cats that's what it is so a lot of people will put down cats you know it's only because they don't understand it and they think that all animals are alike i mean no two animals are alike 

569.00 570.05 A: (( mhm )) 

578.89 579.68 A: wow 

578.92 592.69 B: i mean there are different breeds of animals a bird i- a bird is not like a cat a cat is not like a dog a ferret is like no other you know whatever guinea pigs aren't like you know it's all different you just have to learn who your who your little person is 

580.96 581.75 A: uh-huh 

589.24 590.18 A: (( yeah [mn] ))
