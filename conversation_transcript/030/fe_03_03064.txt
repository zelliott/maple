197.50 200.59 A: oh and then they toss them [noise] 

201.71 203.08 A: that's terrible 

204.55 205.87 A: oh my goodness 

205.89 207.05 A: yeah 

207.83 209.12 A: huh

211.53 212.72 A: wow 

211.96 214.86 B: yeah so have you had any other animals 

212.87 213.77 A: (( well that's )) 

214.67 216.42 A: good i've always been a cat owner 

216.22 217.74 B: just a cat oh 

216.92 227.96 A: i've always had a cat i had one cat until i was fourteen and then ah we got a new and then she she passed away and then we got a new cat as a kitten so that's why 

228.01 239.65 A: she's about fifteen years old now fifteen yeah going on sixteen she's an old lady but she's still she killed her first mouse the other day yeah after fifteen years my dad said she finally earned her keep 

230.06 231.29 B: [noise] oh wow 

235.14 236.17 B: oh wow [laughter] 

239.53 241.09 B: oh wow [laughter] 

239.91 250.80 A: so she caught her first mouse um so they're very excited about that but yeah she's she's all the way across the country 'cause i just didn't want to [lipsmack] i felt putting her on a plane would freak her out 

250.74 252.56 B: oh yeah 

251.81 259.71 A: and she she's just you know 'cause they're so cats are so they're such regimented creatures and they hate change 

259.76 261.12 A: and um 

261.52 264.40 A: i just i don't know i wouldn't wanna stick her on a plane 

264.48 265.69 B: yeah 

264.94 267.74 A: and then bring her all the way out here but um 

266.81 268.46 B: yeah 

267.87 273.73 A: [lipsmack] but yeah she's a little tabby cat and she's she's a sweetheart she's very 

274.21 282.00 A: very good i mean she gets bathed and she gets and she's really good about that and um she's just a little princess 

281.99 283.61 B: oh that's nice 

282.75 284.71 A: yeah she's getting old 

284.39 285.51 B: yeah 

284.79 289.43 A: so she's getting up there i don't know i think she's going to outlive us all she's very healthy 

289.42 293.29 B: oh that's good so do you think about getting another one 

290.26 291.85 A: which is good 

293.57 294.87 A: i you know 

293.66 294.80 B: out here 

295.01 299.36 A: i miss having a cat a lot i do but ah i'm not home 

299.38 300.51 B: oh 

299.78 304.18 A: you know so much during the day i just i you know and they hate to be alone 

303.68 304.74 B: yeah 

304.26 314.81 A: and i would just feel so bad and that's why i didn't wanna i didn't wanna put mickan on a plane and bring her out here and she's old and then okay here's this you know little apartment you're going to live in and i'm not going to be home 

313.48 314.11 B: (( [noise] )) 

314.62 316.09 B: yeah true 

315.09 320.51 A: um so i thought about it but usually i just try to 

320.62 323.68 A: you know visit other people that have pets and then [laughter] 

323.57 326.42 B: oh yeah that's a good idea [laughter] 

324.55 329.06 A: yeah live vicariously through that and then ah you know when i go home i see her 

329.02 330.57 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

329.22 330.59 A: (( but um )) 

331.66 336.78 A: yeah so they never so your kids never asked for this the standard dog or 

336.88 343.96 B: [sigh] um well you know i love dogs but we live like in a townhouse and so we do have our own yard 

339.45 340.31 A: (( anything like that )) 

341.74 342.95 A: (( mhm hm )) 

343.54 344.43 A: mhm 

343.78 357.21 B: but it's really not fair for the dog 'cause we like big dogs you know like boxers that's what yeah and so that's not really right and actually the bunny is just mine that was my gift [laughter] so you know they're kinda too young to 

347.70 350.26 A: yeah well that's good 

354.23 355.66 A: [laughter] 

357.30 366.24 B: really you know although they play with him but they don't they can't take care of him you know and so yeah that's something i wanted because i'm a total animal lover 

361.20 362.75 A: no no 

365.72 366.93 A: yeah 

366.35 369.00 B: and then um yeah so 

368.23 372.84 A: no that's good you recognize that because i see so many people with these huge dogs 

372.74 374.70 B: oh yeah mhm 

372.88 378.25 A: you know in little apartments and things like that and the poor dog it's just 

377.24 379.09 B: and that's not right [laughter] 

378.40 384.28 A: no and they don't get to run and it's just not a place for a big dog you need a big yard or 

380.55 381.73 B: yeah 

383.23 384.96 B: oh yeah [noise] 

384.29 387.55 A: at least somewhere close you can take them that they can run 

387.35 396.78 B: yeah so once we you know buy a home then it's perfect you know and you have the time and you have the place it's fine but for now these will do [laughter] 

391.07 392.27 A: mhm 

393.49 395.75 A: mhm mhm 

396.70 401.31 A: [lipsmack] yeah that's why i always love having cats 'cause they're so low maintenance as far as 

397.07 398.11 B: yeah 

401.40 406.47 A: you know um they know where to to to go you don't have to take them out and 

402.18 403.65 B: oh yeah 

406.66 410.99 A: and you can leave them alone for a few days um you know if you do need to go away 

410.73 412.68 B: (( oh yeah yeah that's true )) 

411.41 413.99 A: 'cause we used to kennel my cat but she 

413.98 428.36 A: she always came back in sort of an altered mental state she was very upset when she would come back home [laughter] [laughter] so i don't know what was going on in the kennel but um they you know just now they take short little trips and they have someone to 

420.63 422.09 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

428.50 434.83 A: come in and check on her but you know they just leave out enough food that that she'll be all right for a few days 

430.13 431.56 B: yeah [noise] 

435.07 436.38 B: (( yeah )) 

435.86 436.44 A: (( so )) 

437.18 438.94 A: they're good pets to have 

437.71 438.39 B: (( mm )) 

438.93 453.65 B: yeah i've never had a cat my dad was allergic so yeah but but my sister got a cat and we were talking one day and her cat had a kitten right when i was on the phone so that was kind of exciting [laughter] and then you know she sent ah digital pictures 'cause she's in colorado 

441.13 443.30 A: oh that would do it 

448.35 449.95 A: (( aw )) 

452.09 453.13 A: mhm 

453.22 454.18 A: mhm 

453.59 456.34 B: and it was kinda cool you know they're so little 

455.50 459.91 A: they're so tiny they look like little mice when they're born little kittens aw 

456.44 457.74 B: yeah 

458.65 464.08 B: yes and it was very cute [noise] very cute but yeah 

460.79 462.26 A: (( you know )) 

462.40 466.04 A: we got my cat at at she was like i guess she was six months old 

465.92 467.08 B: oh 

466.37 469.73 A: and her ears were so big 

469.76 476.83 A: she's like this little tabby kitten with huge ears and we always made fun of her she just had the biggest ears in the world and she grew into them 

469.96 470.84 B: oh 

471.39 472.48 B: (( [laughter] )) 

476.66 484.85 A: but she looked like i mean i don't it was just so strange how her ears grew faster than everything else because i just remember her being this big eared thing 

484.59 486.64 B: yeah oh that's cute [laughter] 

485.94 491.96 A: yeah now she's completely proportionate but it was kinda it was kinda funny she was like a little bat when we got her 

491.93 494.21 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

493.03 500.57 A: [lipsmack] but um yeah but she's an she's an indoor cat that usually helps them live a lot longer 

495.86 496.43 B: (( [sigh] )) 

500.42 503.60 B: oh yeah that's better 'cause i don't like those outdoor cats 

501.59 502.47 A: yeah 

503.06 516.75 A: no well they get into fights and they get worms and they get fleas and they get you know and they get all that crap and and so it's just a lot easier when they're um house cats but you know we got her declawed which a lot of people 

506.45 507.46 B: (( mhm )) 

508.49 509.95 B: yeah 

517.29 522.65 A: um are against but it really doesn't it doesn't hurt the animal 

522.56 523.71 B: yeah 

523.06 531.79 A: and if she's an indoor cat it saves your furniture and it doesn't you know it's not she still was able to kill that mouse without her front claws [laughter] 

530.40 531.20 B: yeah 

531.69 533.75 B: [laughter] yeah that's true 

533.10 541.87 A: she's able to something but um no i mean if you have an outdoor cat or an indoor outdoor cat then no you shouldn't declaw them 'cause it's their weapon but 

539.60 540.65 B: yeah 

541.84 548.24 A: um but just for an indoor i don't think there's they don't you know they don't mi- i don't think it's unusually cruel 

548.22 553.76 B: yeah i know there was a big controversy over that i think in hollywood or something they were trying to outlaw that 

548.41 549.17 A: (( at all )) 

550.28 551.36 A: mhm 

553.19 559.95 A: oh i'm sure i'm sure but if but if you do 'cause my first cat was clawed and we had her as an adult 

553.98 556.69 B: some yeah i don't know [laughter] 

559.96 563.15 A: so we couldn't declaw her 'cause you have to do it when they're young 

562.92 564.04 B: oh 

563.44 568.24 A: um and you know i mean the she would [mn] 

568.64 570.43 A: claw everything 

570.59 581.60 A: she would claw all the furniture and then and when we got my cat when she was a kitten before she was old enough to to get declawed you know my mom came down one morning and she was hanging from the curtains 

570.61 571.60 B: yeah 

580.97 582.12 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

581.91 584.87 A: you know [laughter] so just looking at her so 

582.97 585.58 B: yeah [laughter] 

584.91 587.57 A: that wasn't going to work [laughter] so 

586.70 588.36 B: (( no [laughter] )) 

588.03 593.38 A: you know so we got she got spayed and she got declawed at the same time she got the works 

593.05 595.28 B: yeah [laughter] 

593.87 597.53 A: yeah she was not not happy when she came home but um 

598.08 599.89 A: but i don't think that's unusually cruel
