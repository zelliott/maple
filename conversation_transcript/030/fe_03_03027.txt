202.87 205.25 A: oh okay so he's 

204.19 210.56 B: i mean i was married in the past you know and it was like he tolerated my husband 

205.65 206.54 A: uh-huh 

209.83 211.13 A: oh 

210.64 215.09 B: that's why my husband had to get his own cat you know the other cat was like 

214.08 216.70 A: [laughter] 

215.12 221.93 B: my husband's cat and then when my husband you know left i was the one who kept the cats 

222.03 224.50 A: oh okay 

224.58 228.31 A: so did you so you had two cats at one time or 

227.40 231.52 B: yeah at one time i had two cats and you know he just tolerated her

235.20 238.13 A: his cat and your cat did they get along together 

238.59 250.69 B: they got along you know but it wasn't anything like really great you know like uh like i have a friend that she had three cats and they all slept together and stuff like that and it it 

249.32 250.26 A: yeah 

250.62 256.40 B: wasn't like that you know as a matter of fact if he didn't like what i served for dinner 

252.28 253.32 A: oh 

256.46 259.69 B: he would start chasing the other cat 

260.36 263.26 A: really that's odd 

261.08 262.61 B: you know 

263.03 269.29 B: an- an- and and the way to get him to stop chasing the cat was to put down some fancy feast 

269.33 270.82 A: oh 

270.93 272.81 A: [lipsmack] how funny 

272.89 278.25 A: [laughter] is the cat uh real fluffy is it longhaired or is it short haired 

278.03 280.93 B: no he's a domestic short hair 

280.30 281.57 A: oh okay 

281.04 284.01 B: and at this point he's sixteen years old 

283.54 285.36 A: oh my gosh 

284.61 289.74 B: you know so that's why i think part of the reason that he doesn't wanna be bothered you know 

289.34 301.16 A: oh maybe that's it yeah our cat is w- i have two little boys one is um eight and one is five and the five year old when we got the cat 

301.22 303.77 A: used to carry him on his shoulder 

303.80 308.16 A: and he you know the cat was still little he could just hold him on his shoulder 

307.73 308.73 B: right 

308.16 316.50 A: and then as the cat grew it got really huge and now he tries to carry him on his should- and so 

316.45 324.35 A: you know the cats he- he- cameron can hardly carry the cat and we laugh because the cat his name's chewy 

324.35 334.24 A: um he just lays there he doesn't bite he doesn't scratch he doesn't even n- he doesn't even growl or anything he just lays there and takes it 

334.17 335.46 B: oh okay 

335.14 348.16 A: and he even climbs up the um cameron sleeps on the top bunk they have bunk beds and he'll even climb up the ladder to sleep with my little boy on his bed at night 

346.94 348.53 B: oh that's cute 

348.19 356.98 A: yeah we hear the ladder like clunk clunk clunk and i'll say to my husband what was that and he'll go in there and it's the cat he climbs up and down the ladder 

356.46 360.12 B: [laughter] that must be something you ever catch him doing that 

360.07 363.86 A: um well i've seen him do it i've seen him go down it 

363.25 364.66 B: oh wow 

364.13 375.39 A: and he's funny he just and you know he's so attached to the dog that when he doesn't see the dog he'll start walking around meowing 

375.86 383.16 A: until he finds the dog [laughter] he's so wei- i don't know maybe he has mental problems [laughter] 

382.58 387.53 B: no he just thinks the dog is like his mother because that's the way the dog treated him 

385.39 386.32 A: yeah 

387.13 389.25 A: yeah 'cause the dog 

389.23 401.04 A: you know they say every animal in when they come to your house they attach themselves to one person in your household and the dog has become attached to me 

400.97 404.33 A: and then the now the cat's attached to the dog 

404.38 410.39 A: and so the dog is always laying by me and so now the cat's always laying by me too 

409.55 411.75 B: [laughter] 

410.77 411.80 A: (( i'm like how )) 

411.86 422.14 A: on earth you know but whenever my husband around the cat loves my husband for some reason he just purrs and purrs and 

421.94 429.86 A: i get i get jealous 'cause i'll say how come when i pet him he doesn't purr what's the difference between me petting him and you petting him 

429.81 440.34 A: [laughter] but i don't know like right now the dog's sitting her laying on on down by feet and the cat's right over there one foot from the dog so they're funny 

440.64 441.38 A: (( [laughter] )) 

441.14 446.81 B: yeah i think the thing they wanted us to talk about is how much time do we spend taking care of them 

447.29 452.50 A: oh how much time do we spend well we give jen a bath 

452.71 458.17 A: and well we don't really take care of the cat he kinda takes care of himself 

457.99 460.84 B: well still [lipsmack] you need to feed him 

460.32 462.91 A: yeah well we fed 'em every day 

461.02 462.20 B: and you need to 

462.39 467.89 B: yeah and and and that's the thing to like my cat wants to be brushed a lot he's spoilt

468.91 472.98 B: you know he wants to be brushed like four or five times a day 

472.95 480.08 A: how does he let you know that he brushes that he wants to be brushed does he come up and like put his paw on you or something 

481.11 484.14 A: or does he just come by you and then you brush him [noise] 

483.58 485.14 B: well he uh 

485.18 496.89 B: well one of the things he does is he meows you know or cries to let me know and then you know he gives me looks like when he points with his chin to the futon 

490.26 491.13 A: yeah 

497.14 501.20 B: i know that means he wants me to get on the futon and brush him

504.46 508.10 B: you know he's gotten really good at communicating with me 

507.92 513.43 A: what a smart kitty [laughter] and so then you just sit there and brush him 

513.23 523.65 B: yeah well actually he likes me to lay on the futon and then he lays on my chest and then i brush him that's what he wants he has to have the whole routine
