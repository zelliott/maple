87.07 90.77 A: with my daughter well that's easier than some things 

90.11 91.35 B: [laughter] 

91.04 93.67 A: so you you've had pets in the past 

93.36 105.20 B: um i have um but not for a while we're actually um considering getting a dog you know now i have um two girls that are five and eighteen months 

100.29 101.19 A: mhm 

104.83 106.56 A: oh uh-huh 

105.65 108.36 B: so we wanted to wait until they were a little bit older 

108.05 109.10 A: uh-huh 

108.90 109.83 B: um 

111.20 114.13 B: [sigh] because you know you get a pet and 

114.18 119.34 B: you know if we have a pet it's a member of the family and there's much work and 

118.84 120.44 A: yeah yeah 

119.80 120.65 B: so 

121.36 124.56 A: do you have a yard where the dog could be outside 

123.67 135.59 B: we do we do fortunately i mean not all houses out here do but actually we just moved in february and that was one of our things was we have to have a yard we have to have a yard so ah 

134.98 135.92 A: uh-huh 

135.61 141.17 B: by philadelphia standards it's probably not very big but by california standards it's not bad [laughter] 

140.53 152.12 A: well we live in the city in philadelphia and our yard is pretty small but um it is fenced so we can let the dog go out and um so far she hasn't dug under the fence 

143.84 145.08 B: yeah 

152.14 157.59 A: so we don't we should walk her every day but we don't 

157.11 158.16 B: right 

157.81 163.10 A: um i we sometimes just let her out in the back yard 'cause it doesn't take very much time 

162.95 164.28 B: right 

163.57 164.53 A: [laughter] 

164.88 169.09 A: so we don't spend a whole lot of time 

166.37 166.94 B: (( [mn] )) 

169.28 171.31 A: taking care of our dog 

171.45 172.92 A: i i mean 

173.08 174.70 B: he's not high maintenance 

175.44 179.52 A: no well not really i mean a few minutes every 

179.68 181.75 A: you know to feed her 

182.29 188.87 A: i i guess it takes more attention when there's somebody's afraid of the dog and then we have to put the dog out and put the dog away 

186.08 191.44 B: right right i guess where i was coming from our standpoint is if you get a puppy 

191.43 193.02 A: if you get a puppy 

192.21 195.34 B: obviously yeah there's a lot more work involved until 

195.35 197.36 B: you know they get a couple of years old 

196.78 206.81 A: right we would definitely not have gotten a puppy if we had known we were going to have a baby [laughter] we had both things at once [sigh] and um i was working 

201.80 202.99 B: yeah 

207.08 210.63 A: during that year when i when we had the puppy and i 

210.75 215.03 A: i had to pay somebody to come in in the middle of the day to take the puppy out 

214.44 215.79 B: (( [laughter] )) 

215.53 218.70 A: so it was an expensive proposition 

218.24 225.92 B: yeah at least we're here where you know they they can spend enough time outside or be outside and not 

225.27 226.50 A: mhm 

226.11 227.88 B: you don't have to worry about 

227.94 230.26 B: you know them running around the house all day 

230.60 232.24 A: yeah 

230.68 245.18 B: um but we kinda go back and forth on that it's like okay we're going to get a dog is it going to be an inside dog or an outside dog 'cause my husband wants a bigger dog i'm like well bigger dog will have to be an outside dog but i'd rather get something medium sized that you know can be able to come in 

242.89 243.96 A: (( oh )) 

245.43 246.35 A: uh-huh 

245.72 248.79 B: too and something short haired [laughter] 

248.29 249.69 A: yeah 

250.14 255.84 A: well we have a beagle which we we picked partly 'cause she didn't have to go to the to 

255.85 266.83 A: you know to get clipped and groomed but she sheds a lot so there is a lot of dog hair in the house and i guess that's time you know to to clean up after the dog 

259.64 260.78 B: yeah 

267.29 269.48 A: (( you know where where she sheds )) 

269.14 272.05 B: mhm how does she get along with the cats 

269.72 270.82 A: (( because )) 

272.08 273.11 A: um 

273.15 280.96 A: [lipsmack] the our young cat is very playful and loves to play with the dog and the dog likes to chase the cat and 

281.04 284.36 A: and the cat literally jumps over the dog 

284.52 286.83 A: and they're friends 

286.88 290.79 A: the old cat is pretty old and doesn't like to play much 

290.38 291.62 B: [laughter] 

291.79 293.52 A: um so they don't 

293.94 295.93 A: they don't have a lot of interaction 

296.14 301.70 A: but the little the young cat which is a calico so she's black and and um 

301.73 302.29 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

303.03 314.84 A: kind of um what do they call tortoiseshell and white and the beagle is of course brown and black and white [laughter] so they kind of match [laughter] they they are really friends 

305.99 307.03 B: (( uh-huh )) 

309.95 310.93 B: right 

315.67 317.43 B: have you had any other pets 

317.83 319.09 A: yeah 

319.19 323.93 A: we've had mice as as pets 

322.02 322.76 B: (( aw )) 

323.33 324.20 B: yeah 

324.06 327.54 A: and we've had we had a skink 

327.56 333.48 A: which is a kind of lizard that can lose its tail we had a skink for several years 

329.17 330.18 B: right 

333.61 341.02 A: and then my son took it to school for show and tell and and it got lost [laughter] and never came back 

337.12 338.75 B: uh-oh yeah lost it 

341.30 344.71 A: [laughter] so it escaped somewhere into the school 

346.33 347.55 A: (( and let )) 

349.10 351.95 A: me see if there's anything else i think that's it 

353.11 355.76 A: we had quite a few mice in succession 

355.58 357.13 B: [laughter] 

356.31 358.45 A: and then we gave up mice 

358.22 360.39 B: yeah i don't know if i could do mice 

359.88 362.62 A: [laughter] they're smelly [laughter] 

362.02 363.24 B: oh i bet 

363.05 364.46 A: (( [sigh] )) 

364.64 368.94 A: but they say cats are the animal that takes the least care 

369.38 372.03 A: and at least that's true when we go away 

372.10 379.67 A: we can go away and not do much at all for the cats but one our other we did have 

372.11 373.07 B: yeah 

380.06 381.11 A: um 

381.18 390.44 A: we had two cats who were litter mates and one of them developed diabetes and we had to give her insulin shots twice a day 

389.86 391.41 B: (( oh oh oh )) 

392.18 394.82 A: and that was hard that was work 

395.14 399.20 A: when it also meant we had to be sure to be here 

399.33 401.65 A: twice a day to give her her shots 

401.33 402.57 B: yeah 

403.07 407.04 A: [lipsmack] and then one day we gave her her shot and then she went outside 

407.21 410.29 A: and had didn't have her food outside and she hadn't eaten 

410.51 416.08 A: and we came back and she was in a like a diabetic coma 

416.67 419.18 A: [lipsmack] and she didn't recover 

420.03 422.01 A: so that was [sigh] 

422.79 424.71 A: that was the end of that cat 

425.60 434.49 A: that was that was a lot of work though that was ex- an extraordinary amount of work not only did she have get shots but because of the diabetes 

434.53 437.32 A: she urinated an awful lot 

436.89 438.29 B: oh yeah 

437.70 442.81 A: and so the litter box the litter would get soaked 

442.88 446.57 A: in a few days and then of course would be really really heavy 

446.77 447.70 A: um 

447.83 452.80 A: so that that was lot of a lot of work yeah 

450.13 451.42 B: a lot of work 

453.54 459.96 A: and we had to be really careful with food because she was always hungry so she would eat anything that was left out 

459.97 460.86 A: um 

461.10 463.52 A: and the other cat wouldn't eat very much 

463.89 465.13 B: [laughter] 

464.86 467.48 A: [laughter] [laughter] so 

466.90 472.18 B: yeah our neighbors have like four cats and they're very very friendly so they come over all the time 

472.20 473.10 A: hm 

472.46 477.21 B: and i'm actually i mean they'll let my eighteen month old walk right up to them and 

477.22 482.62 B: she tries to give it everything so she like drops rocks on it and balls and 

481.93 483.66 A: oh [laughter] 

482.72 485.49 B: it just lays there and takes it 

486.48 488.40 A: very tolerant cat 

487.72 492.91 B: very tolerant cat so they've kind of at least they have them to play with 

492.92 493.96 A: yeah 

493.00 494.28 B: right now 

494.67 497.89 A: so they your neighbor's cats are outside cats 

497.61 503.59 B: they're um both in you know we had just moved here a couple of months ago 

503.60 514.74 B: so you know we saw the cats and that they were friendly and then i would notice a couple of times i'd come in and shut the garage door and then i'd go out later and i'd open the garage door and i'd see the cat running out 

514.13 515.74 A: oh [laughter] 

514.81 526.12 B: they had snuck into our garage and i said you know i think i kept a couple of your cats in my garage over night by accident and she said well they rotate only one cat gets to be inside at night 

520.04 521.43 A: oh uh-huh 

525.82 527.09 A: [laughter] 

526.44 534.65 B: and then the rest i guess have to sleep outside or in the garage or something she said because when they're all inside she said they would just run round all night long 

528.19 530.22 A: oh i see 

534.53 535.47 A: (( mm )) 

534.96 536.47 B: playing with each other 

536.55 538.69 B: so i guess they all get their turn 

536.63 537.82 A: oh 

538.58 539.39 A: mm 

539.11 542.24 B: unless it's really really cold or 

539.41 540.25 A: (( huh )) 

541.70 548.71 A: well you must have warm weather there 'cause we we couldn't possibly keep our animals outside all night in the winter 

547.12 556.97 B: right well for most of the year we do so in the winter there's you know sometimes a period of a few months where they'll get down into um the thirties or forties 

557.75 559.39 A: [sigh] mm mhm 

558.33 564.10 B: but you know the rest of the time it's usually you know it doesn't get much lower than the fifties 

564.20 565.37 A: oh 

564.86 566.81 B: so we're lucky in that regard i suppose 

566.29 567.59 A: yeah 

567.01 567.99 B: (( [sigh] )) 

568.17 572.81 A: well it can get quite cold here it can get down into the teens 

572.20 573.33 B: right 

573.20 576.34 A: um and we have a lot of i mean gee it's 

576.56 580.76 A: last week it was in the fifties it has been cold here 

581.02 583.91 A: it's just an extraordinarily cold and snowy winter 

583.99 586.38 B: yeah it lasted a long time didn't it 

584.40 585.18 A: um 

586.09 587.50 A: yeah 

587.73 588.83 A: but um 

589.85 599.95 A: our our cats who were fr- who were litter mates that we had from the time they were kittens they were born outside they really wanted to go outside we had the idea that they were going to be inside
