43.86 52.12 A: well that's what we've been doing actually we've been searching my children have always wanted a golden retriever and we've been searching the internet for the retriever rescue sites

51.54 52.61 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

52.05 60.15 A: and they've gotten a lot of really beautiful dogs but the process is i don't know if you've ever tried to get a rescue dog one of the dogs they've actually rescued and

60.37 61.15 A: they 

61.47 63.39 A: um they um 

63.66 78.04 A: they do a a home check my friends have been teasing me because they do more than they say they do for an adoption [laughter] my friends all say they do a home visit and they teach you about the dog and they teach you how to train the dog and all that sort of thing they bring they actually bring a retriever to your house 

65.29 66.61 B: yeah 

68.85 70.49 B: right yeah 

74.54 75.85 B: oh okay 

78.52 90.23 A: so that you can you know try to get comfortable with the dog and my friends have just been having a great time with this because it's been such a difficult process with the application and then a home visit and then they have to check your references 

85.53 86.32 B: huh 

90.51 92.34 A: [laughter] it's just a dog 

91.91 99.99 B: wow wow yeah i i've seen the rescue people um [lipsmack] i i worked at petsmart for a couple 

93.08 94.37 A: so it's been 

100.15 103.47 B: weekends for a while and they would bring in like ah 

103.48 104.44 B: um 

105.14 113.11 B: [lipsmack] what's the other dog not great dane [laughter] the kinda dog greyhound they would bring in greyhounds and those seem really nice dogs 

109.76 112.82 A: oh yeah they have big rescue operations 

113.36 119.01 B: and they're very gentle and they would have you know weekends where they had the rescue dogs come in 

119.34 121.49 B: so yeah i've seen the ah 

121.57 122.78 B: process 

123.14 125.53 B: so hush up okay 

125.43 126.42 A: [laughter] 

125.54 126.28 B: um 

126.92 129.05 A: the kids don't want pets [laughter] 

127.77 134.34 B: [laughter] um well my daughter wants a dog um but like i said since i can't have a cat um you know 

130.22 131.22 A: [laughter] 

134.37 138.80 B: that won't work very well since i'm allergic to cats but my husband doesn't want 

139.65 142.83 B: [sigh] doesn't wanna dog so um we're we're 

140.98 150.73 A: yeah my husband grew up on a farm and he has the feeling he just has always felt that dogs belong outside and i've always believed that if you're going to have a pet it belongs inside so that's been our 

149.36 156.78 B: right right yeah see when i was growing up we always had pets in the house as a matter of fact my mom has a pet now you know 

150.86 153.08 A: big argument 

156.79 166.38 B: and ah we've always always always had dogs i've i've never had a cat [laughter] so i kinda miss having you know an animal it's it's 

166.41 170.68 B: course it is like having a um another child in the house you know 

170.39 181.29 A: yeah that's why with the adoption thing we've asked for an older pet especially with our cat being kinda ruler of the house we figure bringing in a big golden retriever's probably not going to go over real well so 

174.22 175.06 B: uh-huh 

180.49 182.15 B: oh yeah yeah 

181.44 183.55 A: we thought some- somebody older 

182.41 185.56 B: they have they have a dog now that's called a noodle [noise] 

186.07 194.41 B: which is part golden retriever [laughter] and part poodle [laughter] yes yes my husband 

186.16 189.05 A: i don't know what those are poodle and 

189.25 190.84 A: part golden retriever 

191.47 192.74 A: really 

193.02 194.89 A: that's an interesting mix 

194.72 202.22 B: said he saw one the other day and i was thinking that's kind of a strange name for a dog a noodle but yeah yeah he said you know it 

198.90 200.09 A: [laughter] 

202.34 206.85 B: it has the characteristics that it doesn't shed like a poodle 

206.43 207.97 A: well that would be nice 

207.59 214.38 B: you know 'cause the golden retriever does shed [noise] hey you're going to cut me off honey please stop okay 

209.74 211.38 A: yeah absolutely 

213.35 214.22 A: [laughter] 

214.78 227.13 B: [mn] sorry she's banging round the phone and the next thing i know we'll be cut off [laughter] um anyhow yeah so i thought that would be kind of a fun dog to have but then he said that would be big i don't really wanna big dog 

218.48 219.45 A: [laughter] 

227.32 229.28 B: you know if i get a dog i want 

229.51 233.85 B: maybe a a greyhound 'cause they're nice but you know something 

234.12 235.41 B: a lap dog 

234.70 235.92 A: manageable 

235.50 237.69 B: yeah man- a little bit more manageable 

237.80 247.93 A: yeah they had one retriever on that rescue site that had gotten to a hundred and thirty five pounds and this poor thing couldn't even move it said more than two steps without two grown men having to carry it 

237.93 238.85 B: so 

241.91 243.24 B: oh wow 

247.36 249.34 B: wow wow [noise] 

248.28 251.32 A: and they had it with a foster mom and then they'd gotten 

251.41 260.36 A: i think it was a he down to eighty six pounds and so the dog was doing really well now that was can't remember the dog's name it was hoover they called it hoover it 

255.94 258.08 B: wow wow 

259.58 262.92 B: wow i can't imagine how a dog 

260.96 263.46 A: was a big animal [laughter] 

262.93 269.59 B: yeah see and then you gotta feed it you know so if you have a smaller dog you don't have to feed it as much [laughter] you know 

265.07 266.79 A: yeah 

268.30 271.16 A: although our cat likes to be fed quite regularly 

270.61 276.93 B: yeah so um [lipsmack] and the other thing my kids were were thinking about is um 

277.27 278.13 B: (( a )) 

278.44 280.63 B: is it a parrot no a parakeet 

281.01 282.41 B: (( 'cause my ah )) 

282.49 284.24 B: nephew has a parakeet 

284.66 288.11 B: and ah you know he flies around the house and 

287.08 289.71 A: yeah i could do without that i think [laughter] 

288.51 290.75 B: [laughter] 

289.83 301.63 A: well my daughter went to college this year and decided she wanted a pet and of course you're not allowed to have hardly anything so she finally got herself some fish and then found out that the fish aren't allowed as pets in the dormitory either so we have the fish [laughter] 

294.53 295.38 B: oh 

299.51 300.74 B: oh really 

301.45 306.75 B: well that's kinda strange i mean you would think i mean they don't really pee or poop in the dorms you know 

305.35 313.89 A: yeah i know i can't imagine it's just a little tank so it's not like if it broke or something they'd flood the downstairs i mean it's just a she has four fish [laughter] 

310.97 317.56 B: right well i guess they just have to have a a general rule you know to 

315.66 319.11 A: yeah well she was very disappointed [laughter] 

318.10 319.04 B: oh 

319.82 324.37 B: oh [mn] well she's not going to be in college very long so [laughter] 

322.17 325.40 A: no well it just feels that way [laughter] 

324.28 335.78 B: [laughter] yeah it does especially the last year [laughter] but um yeah what i was hoping is when we i'd like to move and when we get a uh move we'll have a bigger yard and then you know try and get a- 

335.80 337.78 B: an animal at that point 

338.18 341.35 B: [lipsmack] so but i don't know if that's going to happen so 

341.47 344.16 B: what we do is we visit my mom's dog 

344.12 346.53 A: yeah well that'll work if she's close enough 

345.64 354.67 B: [laughter] yeah so so she's our surrogate pet you know [laughter] we take her for walks and [laughter] we visit and you know the whole nine yards 

349.33 350.25 A: [laughter] 

353.16 357.57 A: either that or get them working at the a._s._p._c._a. walking dogs or 

356.96 358.24 B: yeah 

358.01 359.46 A: feeding or something 

359.11 368.21 B: yes see and then you don't have to have the bother of paying for the vet bills or for the you know [laughter] that's right i don't have to worry about anything [laughter] 

363.98 366.93 A: or boarding when you go out of town for anything 

368.12 371.03 A: a lot easier hard to convince the kids though 

370.75 373.83 B: yeah yeah [lipsmack] yeah so 

372.92 380.04 A: it's been on my daughter's wish list oh probably since she's five a golden retriever and she's almost twenty so [laughter] 

376.67 377.79 B: oh 

378.55 379.71 B: (( oh )) 

380.58 385.36 B: [lipsmack] yeah well sometimes when your husband don't don't want it that's kinda hard to 

384.08 384.93 A: yeah 

385.83 389.74 B: get around they they get priority [laughter] over the dog 

389.30 397.62 A: yeah and then that cat adopted us [noise] and she's she's not very happy about dogs so that's made it more difficult yet 

397.85 400.88 B: now do you have your um [noise] 

402.02 404.78 B: pet outside or inside you have you said you like 

403.79 407.26 A: she's both she's mostly inside 'specially summer time 

405.82 406.66 B: (( i see )) 

407.45 411.63 B: now do you live in a climate that she could be outside if she in the winter 

412.21 416.50 A: um most of the time we're in texas in dallas and um 

415.35 416.60 B: oh okay 

417.57 423.51 B: yeah 'cause that was the other thing we talked about we live in maryland so it'd be kinda hard to 

418.01 419.92 A: the winters don't get too cold 

423.99 428.57 B: have a cat outside you know what i mean 'cause i mean we do get 

426.46 429.15 A: yeah it's just too cold in the winter 

428.73 440.84 B: cold winters [laughter] and we don't really have any place to stick the cat in the winter time if the if if it could you know if it needed to come inside you know what i mean [noise] we don't have a garage or you know something 

432.59 433.46 A: [laughter] 

439.78 442.25 A: yeah if you're allergic that makes it really tough 

441.65 443.99 B: yeah so that wouldn't work very well 

444.08 447.43 B: [laughter] 'cause we've even talked about that you know 

447.47 450.78 B: 'cause you know sometimes you can put cat doors you know 

450.35 451.29 A: mhm 

451.20 455.43 B: in the outside door so they you know but it it just wouldn't work very well [laughter] 

455.35 458.06 A: what about a rabbit [laughter] 

456.91 461.56 B: yeah i actually talked to my husband about that i have a friend that um 

461.96 471.08 B: [mn] potty trained their rabbit which was kind of interesting litter trained litter trained the rabbit which is kind of interesting [laughter] yeah i 

463.67 464.77 A: [laughter] 

464.92 466.88 A: potty trained [laughter] 

470.04 472.74 A: i wouldn't mind doing that with the cat that'd be nice 

471.40 479.98 B: [laughter] [laughter] evidently you can um train them so that they will go in a particular part of their cage 

480.02 481.82 B: instead of the whole cage 

482.19 489.41 B: and then ah that way you you just empty that part of the cage out you know instead of um 

486.62 487.44 A: hm 

490.66 494.55 B: you know instead of having the whole cage to deal with so i don't know 

492.52 493.43 A: yeah 

494.42 496.58 A: i've not heard about that 

495.60 501.29 B: [laughter] yeah i thought that was kind of interesting [laughter] it wasn't going to be that expensive but then 

499.96 500.82 A: [laughter] 

501.59 502.98 B: you know i don't know 

503.70 505.88 B: i don't know that i want the smell of 

507.04 508.59 B: (( rabbits in the hou- you know what i mean )) 

508.46 509.92 A: yeah 

509.05 511.86 B: [laughter] i mean i don- i don't know [laughter] 

512.01 513.52 B: (( i think it would be )) 

512.20 516.44 A: actually my son's best friend's family has a rabbit i don't know if they smell that much 

515.84 518.31 B: they don't you don't think it smells that bad 

517.98 522.53 A: well we've never had one in the house a rabbit doesn't do anything for me so [laughter] 

522.05 527.88 B: yeah see the kids [noise] wouldn't wouldn't care one way or the other i mean they they want anything that that's furry that's 

526.34 528.09 A: that's breathing 

528.07 529.89 B: breathing that they can 

529.83 531.80 A: pet and cuddle 

530.10 533.97 B: play with you know [laughter] [laughter] i mean we even considered 

534.01 535.83 B: [noise] we had a friend that had 

537.12 538.39 B: (( [noise] pick it up )) 

538.64 540.69 B: we had a friend that [noise] um 

542.49 545.97 B: [noise] that had turtles and we would go visit them all the time 

546.01 551.14 B: and they were offering to give us the turtles [noise] but then i figured we'd have to worry about the 

551.18 553.95 B: (( salmonella problem you know with the turtle [noise] )) 

552.08 553.44 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

553.91 558.00 A: that's what i had as a kid i lived in uh i grew up in brooklyn and had um 

558.13 562.71 A: lived in an apartment and that was the extent of my pets [laughter] turtles 

562.59 563.44 B: uh-huh 

563.34 568.19 A: i don't remember i don't remember the salmonella thing back then but that's what i always had 

564.77 566.46 B: [noise] 

567.83 572.63 B: [noise] yeah i mean don't you have to worry that isn't that the disease i'm thinking about 

570.75 577.92 A: i think you do now 'cause i remember friends talking about that that it's really hard to even find pet turtles now because of the problem with salmonella 

577.62 579.45 B: yeah 'cause so i 

579.59 587.83 B: i didn't wanna have to be concerned that every time you know and you know how kids are they would pick 'em up all the time and then i'd be like 

586.35 588.97 A: yeah and forget about washing their hands 

588.20 594.47 B: forget washing their hands [laughter] i would be constantly [noise] worrying about it you know so 

591.98 592.85 A: yeah 

593.46 599.72 A: yeah 'cause they were fun to pick up and race 'em across the floor or whatever [laughter] whatever you did with them 

597.25 598.66 B: right right yeah
