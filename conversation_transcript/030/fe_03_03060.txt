176.96 185.95 B: cat scans and everything [laughter] ran ran on him [noise] to find out what the problem was because at that point we didn't know he was epileptic but 

184.97 186.04 A: uh-huh

229.56 230.44 A: uh-huh 

232.56 233.54 A: yes 

233.26 234.88 B: yeah a lot of time how 'bout you 

234.57 240.60 A: well i live in florida where it's extremely hot so ah our cats are indoor cats 

240.02 241.64 B: okay right 

241.01 247.09 A: um we did have them declawed because being um inside they tend to tear everything up 

245.02 246.16 B: right 

246.65 247.77 B: right 

247.22 259.03 A: and um when i owned a restaurant obviously i didn't have a great deal of time with them um and then my husband had open heart surgery so i was home quite a lot with them 

256.45 257.26 B: ah 

258.34 259.36 B: right 

259.40 267.69 A: and now i work with the elderly um but i only do a couple of nights a week so the rest of the time i'm home with my babies 

267.10 268.44 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

267.81 275.69 A: um and in actual fact luckily we have a large bed because all four of us sleep in [laughter] in and on the bed at night [laughter] 

272.99 275.95 B: [laughter] 

275.73 288.00 B: these guys try to get up into bed with us and i'm like there's no room guys it's it's a queen size bed but still they're they're going to be well the the oldest one's already forty five pounds and the other one's not too far behind [laughter] 

281.45 282.51 A: uh-huh 

287.23 296.37 A: and i'm thinking my cats are huge 'cause my large one i have i use two arms to carry him about because he he is so heavy now 

289.02 290.25 B: [laughter] 

293.57 294.85 B: [laughter] 

295.93 296.88 B: [laughter] 

296.57 297.84 A: (( ah [mn] )) 

297.64 303.87 B: i used to have a shih-tzu for years so i'm used to this tiny tiny little dog and then my husband 

299.93 301.02 A: (( uh-huh )) 

303.95 307.38 B: started researching dogs that would be good for our little boy and 

307.60 313.24 B: i thought at first i did not want this big dog now we have two of 'em [laughter] [laughter] but 

311.16 312.16 A: ah 

312.19 316.14 A: i i've never had dogs i've always had cats um 

313.70 314.49 B: (( yeah )) 

314.81 316.98 B: yeah i had cats growing up 

316.57 329.46 A: yeah in england where i was born we always had cats um and then we decided to have two because they are company for one another [sigh] um and we got one from the s._p._c._a. here and then another one 

329.27 333.91 A: was abandoned the one with the heart murmur so that's how we got our two again 

331.70 332.46 B: (( oh )) 

333.72 338.63 B: you said england i knew with your accent i love your accent [laughter] 

335.68 341.17 A: [laughter] thank you [laughter] i've lived in florida fifteen years [laughter] [laughter] 

339.35 342.73 B: really [laughter] but it stays with you [laughter] 

341.38 350.21 A: [laughter] ah um but i couldn't think of a household without pets um you know pets pets make the household 

345.89 347.00 B: right 

349.28 350.33 B: right 

350.28 355.63 A: and i'm very lucky because as i say they're both house trained um 

354.71 356.37 B: right 

355.86 361.42 A: and apart from both of them having a lot of fur um and my youngest one 

361.35 375.60 A: um although he's um not an actual breed um but he has so much fur i mean masses of it and i have white everywhere because he is pure white um so he makes me vacuum every day [laughter] 

367.93 368.74 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

373.92 374.72 B: right 

374.74 380.13 B: that's the reason these caissons they're furry they they don't have like dog hair it's like a 

380.56 384.35 B: a fur i can't describe it it's like a bear's fur 

383.95 385.08 A: uh-huh oh 

384.52 389.74 B: and they do not shed they blow their coats once a year in the spring 

388.28 389.54 A: okay 

389.97 394.11 B: so we brush 'em a lot and vacuum a lot in april 

393.83 394.84 A: yes 

394.22 402.04 B: and then that's it the rest of the year they do not shed so that was another thing with bringing in a dog i was like i don't want something i have to you know constantly 

396.17 397.28 A: wow 

402.07 403.68 B: vacuum [noise] so 

403.04 406.15 A: this is wonderful i'm learning so much information 

404.80 412.16 B: [laughter] and the same thing we live in north carolina so it's it's warm here and they're actually 

406.56 407.64 A: (( ah )) 

409.27 410.19 A: uh-huh 

412.31 417.80 B: cold natured dogs so they need to stay in with the air conditioning so that's another reason we keep them in 

417.41 428.49 A: that's like when we go on vacation i always keep the air down for the cats so whoever takes care of them for me um they're still in a nice environment for them 

421.19 422.35 B: right 

427.26 432.07 B: right ours come in and and we have the central air so they flop on the 

431.99 446.47 B: vents in the floor and they sleep on the vents on the floor that's as soon as they come in [sigh] but they have yeah we keep 'em in most of the time mainly because of the the heat course it doesn't get as hot as florida but it gets pretty humid 

433.41 434.21 A: yes 

442.63 443.66 A: uh-huh 

446.03 459.61 A: well it's ninety or ninety one degrees here today so both my cats are inside the air conditioning's going the fans are going and they have nice ice cold water and milk as well as their food so 

449.20 450.21 B: (( [laughter] )) 

451.39 454.78 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] )) 

459.66 461.75 A: (( they are both thoroughly spoilt )) 

460.55 463.20 B: [noise] [laughter] now what part what part of florida 

462.91 464.16 A: (( near tampa )) 

463.89 465.47 B: okay okay 

464.69 466.71 A: (( yes and ah )) 

466.73 468.13 A: as i say ah 

468.55 470.60 A: my babies are always with me 

470.26 472.01 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

471.12 477.32 A: my daughter is grown up and she's in england so so i have a substitute now [laughter] 

473.63 474.67 B: okay 

475.58 487.66 B: [laughter] well that's what i keep saying i have a four year old and i thought what happens when he grows up there's no telling what i'll end up with as far as animals [laughter] because i already have the two here of course they're gonna be here 

487.80 493.68 B: probably till he graduates from high school we're looking at before you know because they live to be about fifteen 

493.30 494.41 A: yes 

493.94 494.90 B: so 

494.83 509.26 A: well with my cats being uh sixteen and eleven you know i kind of if i go on vacation i say to my friends well if either of the one you know go or gets sick you know i'm expecting it because sixteen for a cat is 

504.21 505.61 B: right 

506.26 507.32 B: right 

508.12 509.75 B: that's wonderful 

509.30 511.91 A: what a hundred and twelve in um 

510.47 512.74 B: right [laughter] 

511.98 523.80 A: our years so you know he he's an old man [laughter] ah but ah yeah the only other pets i think is when we were in england we had ah my daughter had a rabbit 

512.78 514.00 B: right 

515.38 518.61 B: right [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] 

523.97 534.98 A: um and that was fun ah that was when she was in her early teens and ah we had him out on the patio obviously with a cage and a run 

534.13 535.25 B: right 

535.03 538.63 A: um so we had two cats and a rabbit then 

537.50 538.96 B: [laughter] 

538.65 540.73 A: uh uh but 

541.55 545.38 A: oh i thought that was the end of it [laughter] i heard a click 

543.36 544.25 B: no 

544.74 546.32 B: (( oh i didn't hear anything )) 

545.49 548.34 A: um and ah so 

548.62 555.13 A: um as i say they're about the only animals i've had dealings with um my ah 

552.58 553.42 B: oh 

555.27 564.75 A: daughter in law had um dogs at one time um and they were what we call alsatians or you call german shepherds over here 

558.75 559.76 B: right 

563.29 565.49 B: right right 

564.86 570.81 A: um and i must admit i was a little bit frightened of those they were kind of a little bit on the aggressive side 

569.82 571.25 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

570.82 575.37 A: um so i really haven't had a lot of dealings with dogs 

574.68 584.85 B: right my caissons look a lot like the german shepherd but with really long furry hair they like they're like a they're actually um from the dutch is who bred them 

584.47 585.48 A: uh-huh 

585.11 593.25 B: to begin with but they they're that way too most people think they're afraid of 'em when they first see 'em and then once they get to know what big babies they are they're 

586.00 587.00 A: yes 

593.16 596.00 A: well i think it's how you treat your animals 

595.24 597.25 B: right that makes a difference 

596.48 599.89 A: um because you know if you treat them as part of
