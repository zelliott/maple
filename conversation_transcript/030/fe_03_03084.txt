126.91 128.78 B: oh we get along fine now 

129.11 130.58 B: she knows 

131.06 135.22 B: that when i say lay down that's what she's supposed to do 

135.37 148.44 B: you know when i say stop barking that means be quiet you know yeah we get along fine now although i'm still not in a position to really keep her because i'm not here all the time 

149.32 151.71 B: so it's kind of rough 

152.10 155.13 A: how d- how did you happen to get chosen for a pet call 

155.61 158.82 B: actually i don't know [laughter] 

157.68 159.37 A: [laughter] 

158.95 160.17 B: i don't know 

160.29 161.42 B: um 

161.64 172.24 B: shin my my son i have a five year old so he loves champagne he loves his dog 'cause i got him i got the dog after he turned a year old 

172.69 174.86 B: 'cause he wanted a puppy and 

175.16 180.26 B: it kills me not to ke- to hold onto the dog 

180.79 186.60 B: because i really just can't i just don't have the time for her and he's not 

186.66 190.95 B: up in age where he can do all the things that need to be done for the dog 

190.67 191.78 A: right 

192.41 195.19 A: so why are you afraid of cats any particular reason 

194.63 198.93 B: well you know um i was pregnant with my first son um 

199.10 200.34 B: years ago 

200.76 202.00 B: and 

202.44 210.67 B: my girlfriend i was over my girlfriend's house and i think her cat kind of sensed that i was afraid of him 

210.93 214.56 B: so all of a sudden the cat jumped up on me 

214.78 217.47 B: and started scratching and clawing 

218.14 221.79 B: and from that point on i have been afraid of cats 

222.78 229.76 A: well that's too bad 'cause a cat would actually be better suited to the way you live because you can go off and leave a cat 

224.12 225.27 B: yeah 

229.29 230.40 B: mhm 

230.37 239.48 A: for a few days and you know leave him some dry food and some water and and a place to go to the bathroom and he'll take care of himself just fine 

238.98 240.28 B: oh okay 

240.15 243.60 A: but a dog you can't do that with 

242.09 243.98 B: no not at all 

244.45 259.15 B: not at all and see i i think the only reason why i have a dog is because i was raised up around dogs as opposed to cats now my mother has she has a cat she is she's had cats over the years and 

260.28 264.96 B: i don't know for some odd reason though all those cats seemed to know 

265.10 274.83 B: that i was afraid and they would just come and just you know how they just jump up on the jump up on you or jump behind a chair that you're sitting on 

274.52 276.34 A: (( oh yeah )) 

275.07 276.14 B: you know 

276.15 278.43 B: and it would be like oh my gosh 

278.59 281.24 B: but i was a heart attack coming for real 

281.45 282.24 B: (( [laughter] )) 

282.03 283.88 A: well i'm 

283.96 288.04 A: i have had as many as twenty five cats at one time 

287.31 289.46 B: oh my gosh 

289.12 290.24 A: that 

290.46 295.66 A: ah they're free to go outside whenever they want to but they basically live in the house with me 

295.33 296.69 B: oh okay 

297.18 299.98 B: now how many cats do you have now 

299.60 303.16 A: right now i only have six 

301.84 306.63 B: oh okay do you have any of 'em that are they all females boys or 

306.37 310.40 A: no it's a mix boys and girls 

307.52 308.69 B: oh okay 

309.14 312.05 B: so do they have ar- are they all spaded or 

311.43 312.65 A: they're all fixed 

312.37 316.76 B: oh okay so you don't have to worry about any little kittens running around 

316.19 324.45 A: no well i've had my share of kittens when i've gotten a cat that's already been been pregnant and i haven't had the heart to kill the kittens 

323.13 324.55 B: oh okay 

324.70 337.39 A: but i mean that's okay it's just with me if there's an animal in need i mean my horses are rescue horses my dogs are rescue animals um that can't find placement 

332.58 333.95 B: oh okay 

337.16 343.41 B: now what kind of rescue um oh okay they were um brought in to you 

343.66 346.10 B: for being abused and things of that nature 

346.13 353.19 A: ah n- no usually i have either found them or i belong to a couple of rescue organizations that 

349.18 350.14 B: okay 

353.31 355.78 A: ah for instance the horses 

355.94 361.26 A: ah two of them have been horses that they felt that they couldn't sell because they were 

361.58 365.20 A: um either too old or they had a physical 

365.65 370.13 A: fault that would not allow them to be ah ridden a lot 

369.44 370.58 B: mhm 

370.22 373.48 A: or they didn't want people to ride them because they 

373.40 374.66 B: were temperamental 

374.76 377.43 A: no they were they were physically 

377.97 383.34 A: um for instance one of the mares i got had weak knees 

382.99 384.10 B: (( oh okay [mn] )) 

383.96 389.33 A: and and shouldn't be ridden a lot she could be ridden lightly but not a lot 

388.69 389.78 B: mhm 

389.48 402.87 A: and kids get on a horse and they run the living daylights out of 'em and this was not a horse for that so i took her and then i then i rescued another actually i resc- rescued a colt by myself but 

394.47 396.24 B: oh okay okay 

402.99 405.60 A: most of the animals i either find 

405.70 408.52 A: or they find me [lipsmack] one 

408.63 409.98 A: way or another 

409.56 410.55 B: mhm 

410.48 415.40 A: and ah i can't find homes for 'em so i bring 'em home [laughter] 

413.44 414.80 B: oh okay 

415.06 417.32 B: okay now do you have children at home 

417.32 418.10 A: no 

417.92 418.91 B: okay 

419.21 421.67 B: so i guess they are a lot of company for you 

422.93 425.11 A: ah they are 

425.27 430.99 A: and i prefer to live alone and so i mean i say i live alone but i don't 

430.49 433.03 B: mhm right because you have all your animals 

432.28 442.54 A: because i have all my animals and and the nice thing about animals is that they're they are what they are they don't lie they don't cheat they don't steal 

439.83 440.39 B: (( [mn] )) 

442.03 444.19 B: that is true that is true 

443.99 446.78 A: and and i appreciate that 

446.49 447.84 B: mhm 

447.26 455.80 A: in them so i am very happy being i mean i've been married a couple of times and i'm but i'm very happy not to be 

452.98 453.72 B: mhm 

455.60 456.78 B: (( oh okay )) 

457.09 459.68 B: okay and that's the choice you've made that's yo- 

458.90 462.29 A: yeah and that's just what works for me 

459.86 460.90 B: and that's 

461.03 464.02 B: and and i understand that um 

464.14 469.95 B: when you say that they they are there to protect you basically they are not there to harm you 

470.34 474.55 B: because you take care of them and t- they can be your very best friend 

474.50 480.34 A: and they are all of them every one i got a horse right now that is really freaky 

480.44 485.60 A: scares the living daylights out of me because he's been abused 

485.02 486.43 B: (( [mn] oh okay )) 

486.02 493.34 A: but we're making friends and you know eventually um he won't be so freaky 

492.87 493.84 B: (( mhm mhm ))
