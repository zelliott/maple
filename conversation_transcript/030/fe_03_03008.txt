253.82 267.28 A: i mean you know all of them were not pet pets i mean they were some of them were breeders that were just in the house and had not been hadn't been acclimatized to the weather yet so they they were in like the utility room but 

262.56 263.82 B: oh okay 

266.94 273.25 B: yeah but they still count they're [laughter] part of your family in one way or another [noise] oh that's just

276.37 280.86 B: [noise] so where do you sell your birds to uh pet stores 

280.11 284.47 A: ty- typically to pet stores we sell to individuals sometimes but 

283.66 296.45 B: yeah oh i can't imagine where i'd even buy one here i just i've never seen 'em in the stores [noise] ever uh-uh no oh i live in indiana and they our pet stores don't have birds at all 

284.96 285.70 A: (( oh )) 

289.90 290.91 A: really 

295.71 296.61 A: well 

296.66 300.74 A: [laughter] we try to find places like 

299.92 302.02 B: to sell 'em [laughter] 

300.78 304.07 A: yeah up there because you know shipping up there you know we 

304.26 307.00 A: down here in florida there's a um 

307.81 314.10 A: [noise] a flood on the market you know and i can't i can't hardly get anything but if i can ship up north 

309.43 311.10 B: oh sure sure 

313.79 319.47 B: then you'd be all right oh but they don't sell any bird i mean anything i 

314.89 316.60 A: yeah i can [mn] 

319.72 327.91 B: i guess i've never seen a single bird for sale of any type but even like when i was little i remember seeing baby turtles for sale and 

327.18 328.29 A: right 

327.96 329.25 B: it it's a 

328.61 331.25 A: most places have outlawed those does now 

330.64 333.83 B: oh have they well maybe that's why i don't see 'em oh 

331.37 332.35 A: because 

332.98 337.93 A: because well i mean you'd have to go through special licensing and all because they have salmonella 

337.99 350.08 B: oh okay all right oh well we only see cats and dogs and that's it and yeah there's nothing in a pet store of course pet stores are very prevalent here either so 

340.19 341.79 A: (( yeah so )) 

343.35 344.48 A: really 

349.21 350.11 A: yeah 

349.99 354.65 B: but no you if you don't want a cat or dog or or guinea pig you 

354.36 355.84 A: yeah yeah 

354.75 364.03 B: you don't get anything so and the cities are trying to curtail it so you can't even if you like have a litter of cats that you're not supposed to sell 'em from home 

362.16 363.26 A: (( [noise] right )) 

364.27 369.96 B: so like like if you have a litter i'm not sure what you're supposed to do with them because the pound doesn't want 'em 

365.02 365.84 A: [mn] 

369.76 371.50 A: yeah yeah 

370.34 375.60 B: so then you're just stuck with them so the city's getting involved 

374.40 376.81 A: but you can only keep three so 

376.02 385.82 B: you can only keep three and the rest of 'em like we're gonna tell the city but [laughter] oh hey look what i got guys but [laughter] no it's just kinda weird that 

380.16 381.67 A: yeah yeah 

383.05 384.01 A: (( yeah )) 

385.58 391.30 B: yeah the city's kinda getting in on that but i'm sure you guys have rules and regulations down there too that are 

389.23 390.40 A: oh 

390.58 400.24 A: yeah we have you know technically down here if you have you know a a small you're supposed to be licensed by the state 

399.68 400.69 B: okay 

400.51 402.20 A: you know and 

402.14 406.20 A: uh we had a big zoning thing a few years back where 

406.09 417.31 A: if you had if you have less than five acres you can only have two birds more than you know i think six hundred grams or something 

416.85 419.65 B: oh gosh [laughter] [laughter] 

418.12 422.56 A: and uh you know i'm going hey i've got macaws and i've got 

422.59 433.74 A: amazons you know these guys all are right up there and and i'm not getting rid of 'em because you decide to change you know because one guy made the zoning department mad you know 

432.88 438.57 B: oh and then they go after everybody uh-huh uh-huh yeah well that makes sense but 

435.30 436.76 A: yeah yeah 

437.98 439.22 A: (( [noise] no )) 

439.28 442.93 B: good old city regulations oh they have to 

442.17 443.46 A: yeah 

443.08 445.91 B: be checking on ya oh mm 

444.28 445.36 A: (( oh yeah )) 

445.61 448.81 A: we just we get a lot of rescue birds that 

448.33 450.09 B: oh do ya oh good 

449.10 450.06 A: (( yeah they )) 

450.07 452.97 A: they'll never be breeders but we 

453.24 467.33 A: it's kinda kind of a rule at our place if it comes it stays it never has to wo- you know it has a home it may not you know even if it's out- outside with the other birds i mean at least it's with other birds you know and hears them and sees them 

457.04 458.02 B: (( oh good )) 

465.80 467.08 B: right 

467.20 468.99 B: there is safety there 

468.28 471.42 A: yeah and they get [noise] you know they get fed 

471.45 474.47 A: i feed you know good food [noise] and i 

475.46 482.03 A: you know take care of 'em and i have to go back and to since the fire i'm not down there every day but 

477.96 478.65 B: so 

481.66 484.81 B: so you get 'em like with broken wings and stuff or they just 

483.88 497.98 A: well i get i you know these peop- people will buy a bird uh we got one yesterday it's a nanday conure it's a you know they're they're beautiful birds i i love 'em to death but they're noisy 

497.70 499.89 B: (( ah okay )) 

499.32 502.86 A: and if you don't if you're not used to 'em [noise] 

502.76 503.75 B: [laughter] 

503.65 507.94 A: they you know they they nip at you sometimes and [noise] and 

508.08 509.19 A: they don't 

509.85 514.25 A: they're not cat that goes and lays on the couch they're active animals 

512.05 513.39 B: (( [laughter] )) 

513.42 516.11 B: uh-huh uh-huh so 

515.24 517.01 A: and uh [noise] 

517.10 519.08 B: then they get rid of 'em they don't mm 

518.25 522.45 A: yeah yeah they go i can't you know i can't handle this animal and 

522.56 523.63 A: (( uh )) 

524.92 526.79 B: so they default and 

526.20 531.44 A: yeah yeah and so we get an animal that's been raised as a pet that it'll probably never bred 

531.49 535.05 A: or we'll get people go my grandmother had this parrot 

535.51 539.23 A: okay you know and it's it's sixty years old 

535.80 536.95 B: [laughter] 

539.45 543.29 A: and it's it might breed but [sigh] 

542.76 544.96 B: or then again yeah mm 

543.83 553.25 A: you know it i mean amazons can do that you know at that age but it's it's always been a pet you know it's never been around other birds so 

552.46 555.68 B: it's it's not gonna know what to do oh 

554.39 562.15 A: yeah so the best we can do is give it a chance to get used to being ar- you know let it spend the last few years around other birds you know 

561.14 564.80 B: mm like a hospice for birds [laughter] 

563.57 570.04 A: yeah yeah well i mean we went down we were down in south or central florida looking at birds and 

570.25 578.68 A: the guy opened this utility room that had no windows and one lightbulb that was not turned on in the late afternoon 

578.94 584.51 A: so i can only assume it had not been turned on all day and here's this blue and gold macaw in there which 

581.11 582.39 B: yeah 

584.56 590.45 A: normally they're a spectacular bird but this one only had about twelve feathers on it 

590.04 593.34 B: oh it's like a mistreated bird [mn] 

591.32 592.59 A: and it 

592.74 599.89 A: yeah one of its feet was turned under and the guy said yeah i'm selling him for five hundred dollars and
