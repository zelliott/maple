206.90 207.85 B: mhm 

207.16 214.71 A: well the chihuahua doesn't wanna do that because [mn] she just basically wants to be in under the covers somewhere [laughter] you know 

213.66 214.99 B: somewhere safe 

214.87 222.65 A: yeah i guess so and she she feels safe here now but she's still a house dog ah you know she's just

249.89 256.04 A: [lipsmack] oh she's just so mischievous and so we i go out there i'm i'm not working right now i'm at home 

256.18 271.08 A: and ah it's kind of fallen to me to exercise this dog so i'm which i don't mind most of the time but after for about an hour throwing the ball and working in the yard and you know what i'm saying oh 

268.21 273.00 B: [laughter] yeah that's so funny you know what's funny is that um 

273.23 275.46 B: that's what they always say with larger dogs 

276.00 278.90 B: that large dogs need all this exercise 

279.97 280.99 A: (( [sigh] oh )) 

281.00 281.97 A: really

310.61 318.83 A: but i didn't know that about big dogs 'cause my grandparents always had big dogs and they never never i've never seen a dog like this they were just 

319.26 332.87 A: [sigh] maybe 'cause i wasn't around when they were this age i don't know but i was thinking of a big dog as being mellow more and i guess it's probably the different breeds and this and that and the other thing 

326.66 327.65 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

332.06 335.85 B: [sigh] [sigh] probably like i know like labs can be pretty
