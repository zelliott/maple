34.35 36.61 A: well that's cute i like that 

36.40 43.13 B: yeah and they're both about a year old and they're a lot of fun 

43.56 46.82 B: and they uh one of them fetches 

47.79 51.33 A: okay i never heard that from a cat before [noise] 

48.64 49.79 B: i 

50.72 53.35 B: yeah well i taught my cat to fetch 

53.41 63.42 B: and uh it's very interesting and um [lipsmack] i've always had pets in my life and i think it's very nice to have them if you can 

64.04 66.52 B: did you ever think of having a pet [noise] 

65.95 69.79 A: [noise] i did when i was a child and 

69.89 75.98 A: um once i got out on my own and had my daughter i tried then too 

75.99 90.67 A: and just actually a couple of years ago we tried to have another dog and it just didn't seem to work out with me working i didn't have the time to properly you know train the animal the dog and my daughter she 

79.36 80.88 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh [noise] )) 

88.52 89.63 B: sure 

91.02 98.42 A: just you know it was her time to start going out and having fun and she was just too busy to stay home and train the dog 

96.30 102.60 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] oh especially as a as a teenager it's hard to be home and do everything you wanna do [noise] 

100.43 101.31 A: (( [noise] )) 

102.40 109.79 A: right and then with me being um [noise] i had got disabled i wasn't able to do it so we just kinda 

106.63 108.41 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

110.64 113.43 A: you know decided no pets [laughter] 

113.29 120.03 B: okay it's you know some- sometimes you have the opportunity and sometimes you don't so that's understandable 

119.31 122.93 A: [noise] right and i think more people you know some people have 

123.89 126.98 A: the ability and the knowledge and just the 

127.77 131.60 A: just the born in effect of what to do with the animal 

130.88 136.49 B: [noise] [noise] oh sure i see the difficulty of having pets sometimes is that you don't have the time 

136.36 148.78 B: to play with them or if you have to go away what do you do next and [noise] what i do sometimes is that when i go away either i would have a neighbor watch them or i would bring them to a veterinarian to board them for a week or so 

148.50 150.07 A: mhm 

148.84 157.52 B: so so it it's interesting but uh they're good animals and cats are independent more than dogs so a lot of times you don't have to 

157.36 168.34 B: watch everything that they're doing they still have the tendencies like dogs do like they wanna nibble and bite but they're playful and then and sometimes they may not be as 

168.65 178.06 B: uh friendly or sometimes they may not be as loving and affectionate as dogs do so it's different depend on what kind of animal you like basically to have 

178.11 179.23 A: right 

178.36 192.44 B: um i've always had pets in my life unfortunately sometimes i didn't meaning like there were a few years that i was not able to but [sigh] i think it's nice to have a pet if you can if you have children a lot of times it it teaches them the responsibility 

192.53 197.91 B: and also gives them an opportunity to get close to an animal where they would not be frightened 

198.86 200.12 B: [noise] how about you 

201.06 207.47 A: i you know i believe the same thing and it's just pets to me 

207.48 211.37 A: like i my sister had a shih-tzu dog 

211.28 212.39 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

211.75 217.27 A: and she had a dog for many years it was just a puppy when they got it for a christmas present 

217.37 225.33 A: and my mother was never a animal person too much you know she didn't hate animals or anything 

221.91 223.60 B: (( [noise] [noise] ah okay )) 

224.89 226.14 B: [noise] uh-huh 

225.58 226.53 A: (( but )) 

226.85 233.75 A: with this um shih-tzu of my sister's my mother just completely attached to it 

233.65 235.20 B: (( [noise] ah okay )) 

234.72 239.63 A: and they would go on vacation all the time like every three or four months 

237.98 238.73 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

239.69 252.69 A: and my mother would always watch it well it first started out where she would go over there and keep an eye on the dog like go le- you know let her out let him out you know and then make sure he had food and water and that 

252.02 253.54 B: (( [noise] sure [noise] )) 

252.78 260.21 A: well then as time went on and she got more attached to nicholas then he was coming home with her 

260.11 262.06 B: (( ah okay [noise] )) 

260.73 268.96 A: but then she would take him back but then as more time went on he was staying with her [laughter] you know 

267.51 269.69 B: (( [noise] [noise] huh that's interesting yeah )) 

269.60 270.76 A: and it just 

270.82 272.98 A: i i don't know it um 

273.86 274.81 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

274.14 279.35 A: either that you just have to be around them enough i think to have them grow on you 

279.79 280.89 A: or 

281.07 286.03 A: i don't know it's just it's always been hard for me to accept a animal in the house 

285.90 287.63 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh okay )) 

286.46 291.88 A: and with cats in your instance i always used to have nightmares as a child [laughter] 

290.97 292.80 B: oh okay 

292.20 293.56 A: of cats 

293.14 297.49 B: [laughter] have you have you done a few of these surveys before 

297.04 299.26 A: this this is my first one 

299.15 300.93 B: oh okay well i 

299.83 302.00 A: (( can you tell [laughter] [noise] )) 

300.98 313.40 B: i've i've i've done a few and i think it's very interesting 'cause you learn a lot from other people around the united states [noise] and how they think and do things and different lifestyles you know so it it's interesting 

313.32 323.08 B: and it's nice to talk to people to see what everybody's about but pets are very interesting in a lot of ways it just gives a little bit more harmony in the home if you can 

323.13 324.23 A: mhm 

324.55 333.93 B: and um i don't know if you if you're children have pets where they live if they're married or anything like that but if if they can it would be really nice to have 

334.52 340.49 A: no my daughter she still lives at home with me and she would love to have an animal 

337.51 338.84 B: (( okay [noise] )) 

340.90 343.16 A: um unfortunately [noise] 

343.23 354.46 A: you know once again she's not home enough to be able to train it or spend you know give it the time it needs and plus uh the duplex that we live in we're not allowed to have animals 

346.78 348.22 B: [noise] right 

348.69 349.53 B: [noise] 

354.01 365.21 B: oh i see well my well well my well my two c- my two cats are therapeutic cats we're not supposed to have 'em either but they don't go outside so they basically stay inside 

354.79 355.73 A: so 

355.83 357.69 A: (( and i mean she's had a hamster )) 

365.25 366.74 B: (( and [cough] ))

372.68 374.05 A: (( right [noise] )) 

375.18 387.30 B: but other than that uh the surveys are very interesting and you will enjoy 'em and [noise] it's something that you can learn a lot from other people around the united states basically 

386.80 395.95 A: well that's one of the reason that i signed up for them and plus to with me only being on disability and only getting less than 

396.03 402.08 A: a little bit than what seven fifty a month it the ten dollars helps out here and there 

398.52 399.94 B: [noise] [noise] right

402.23 402.84 A: (( [laughter] )) 

403.27 407.12 A: you know 'cause it's definitely hard to live on that 

406.64 417.35 B: sure and you learn different things and and it's good and um i think you will enjoy everything about the surveys 'cause you will learn a lot about different type of uh people too 

418.51 422.95 A: definitely and i take it they talk on different topics all the time 

422.77 428.39 B: yes they do they talk about different topics you know it could be people it could be pets it could be 

428.22 441.10 B: places of interest um and it's good because they wanna basically find out how people relate to different facets of uh life itself and family life family's important you know 

441.12 445.47 B: and what's in the family could be very important to people as they get older too so 

444.62 445.83 A: (( [noise] right )) 

446.05 449.27 B: [noise] but you will enjoy it and uh
