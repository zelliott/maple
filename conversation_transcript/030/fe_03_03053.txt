325.58 330.40 B: when we played it was really ah freak- freaky it was like um 

331.17 339.62 B: [lipsmack] it was [laughter] usually though she doesn't like it she doesn't like the not doesn't like the music she sees the music as 

339.67 342.26 B: ah we don't pay attention to her 

341.70 344.30 A: [laughter] right right 

343.02 352.89 B: so she sees she looks at it that way but she really freaks out when we have a tape on and because she can recognize the sounds and then she 

349.29 350.67 A: [laughter] 

353.39 357.29 B: (( doesn't you know understand how come we're ))

361.27 362.04 A: (( [laughter] huh )) 

361.71 363.14 B: that's just trippy 

362.37 366.64 A: ah have you thought about incorporating her into ah your act if you get to vegas 

365.21 369.69 B: (( no no no )) 

366.87 368.65 A: no [laughter] 

369.79 372.00 A: oh all right just a thought 

370.53 372.93 B: [lipsmack] yeah [laughter] 

372.24 373.75 A: [laughter] 

373.37 378.29 B: you know that it there's the logistics of that is so um 

378.00 380.70 A: yeah especially considering she's not a fan of the music 

380.50 381.86 B: yeah right 

380.71 381.42 A: [laughter] 

381.98 394.28 B: but even you know with the there's so much intensity around um when you're doing that that i don't really have time to focus on um 

394.15 395.46 B: her because 

395.23 404.77 B: you know when when you take your animal out and you definitely want to make sure that with traffic and she doesn't run out on the street 

404.22 406.20 A: (( oh yeah oh yeah )) 

404.63 418.10 B: you know and all those kind of issues and some people are really freaked out by dogs you know that they're even though my dog is harmless that they're like tripping that um 

418.32 420.53 B: the dog might um 

420.76 425.47 B: hurt them you know they're when i get on the elevator sometimes in my building they 

425.84 431.63 B: ah ooh and real scared of the do- yeah some people are kind of weird 

427.59 428.86 A: oh really 

430.11 435.69 A: well well how big is a japanese terrier it doesn't sound like a yeah i was going to say it's not a particularly big 

431.96 434.89 B: (( not big at all no it's not big at all )) 

435.41 440.50 B: but you know pe- some people ah they i don't know they have ah um 

440.90 443.11 B: they're just not animal um 

443.83 445.04 B: people 

444.85 446.43 A: ah they're not animal friendly 

446.10 447.58 B: yeah 

446.92 450.27 A: just like some people aren't kid friendly which boggles my mind but anyway 

449.30 452.22 B: yeah yeah 

450.37 451.33 A: (( ah )) 

451.46 454.84 A: so that can ah go into this topic too so 

455.50 459.44 A: ah well the question was how important is a pet right so the hypothetical 

459.52 466.42 A: say i don't know the building decides a not pet policy that you live in i mean would y- would you be willing to move 

463.29 465.04 B: (( oh )) 

465.85 467.32 B: oh we'd have to 

467.23 468.47 A: yeah 

467.37 470.86 B: e- e- yeah we couldn't ah 

471.65 473.54 B: we couldn't just ah 

474.14 478.24 B: give up the dog because of the building yeah we'd definitely have to move 

478.36 484.10 A: what if it was a what if it was a super great location that like in the best spot with an awesome rent 

478.54 479.84 B: what about you 

482.50 496.93 B: there's no super great i don't know if you've been to l._a. [laughter] there's no super great l- location well i've got one over on you i've been to austin texas it's a lovely place i i used to live in huston so i 

485.93 487.21 A: no i haven't 

487.59 488.93 A: [laughter] 

497.10 499.91 B: (( but ah no there's um [lipsmack] )) 

502.25 508.99 B: we're going to move anyway but it's not because of the dog but when you know when you're looking for a place to live 

509.19 513.44 B: with a dog that hampers the situation which 

512.74 519.32 A: yeah it does i mean it it's it's amazing to me that i see people that will move and leave their dog behind 

518.67 520.03 B: oh no 

519.73 522.16 A: or try to give them to somebody you know 

521.46 526.71 B: oh no i couldn't do that that's like part of your family 

523.05 525.91 A: i don't understand that a dog's like part 

526.00 536.43 A: exactly dogs are like part of the family i mean that's ridiculous um i had a neighbor that actually let their dog just like purposely let him run away because i guess 

528.01 529.56 B: [laughter] 

529.94 531.10 B: [laughter] 

535.77 537.39 B: oh no 

536.64 544.72 A: he would get out and the pound would always tend to find him somehow and then they'd have to pay some fee like it's a pretty big fee i guess to go and pick him up 

544.49 545.50 B: oh 

545.02 554.17 A: so eventually one time when he got out they just didn't go and pick him up they're like oh i guess it's easier that way yeah and they'd only had it i think only had him for like a a year and a half 

549.05 550.37 B: oh no 

553.87 554.72 B: mm 

554.63 562.45 A: and it was just i d- that was just that just seems so cruel to me i mean because i know the dog liked them and it was a friendly dog too 

558.57 560.35 B: yeah 

563.06 564.32 B: oh god 

564.42 569.70 A: yeah i mean hey our pets have alway- pets have always been ah pretty important to me actually 

569.73 571.14 B: yeah me too 

570.79 574.38 A: and i don't see [laughter] i don't foresee a time when th- when they won't be 

574.60 576.00 A: important so 

576.18 579.48 B: yeah we're trying to figure out how we can um 

580.49 585.97 B: [lipsmack] what our next move is as far as if we have to do um 

586.94 597.18 B: [lipsmack] if we have to go on a cruise ship it's it's like a six month commitment so we're trying to figure out what we're going to do probably we n- um 

593.48 594.28 A: ooh 

598.09 599.34 B: um
