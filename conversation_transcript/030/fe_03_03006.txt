168.23 169.56 B: that's really cool 

170.01 171.67 B: yeah 

172.11 174.57 B: like actually i have two cats 

172.65 176.21 A: mhm 

174.89 178.95 B: but one is like an outdoor cat and both of them we found 'em 

176.71 177.46 A: (( mm )) 

178.96 190.27 B: but one is like an indoor cat and then the other one's an outdoor cat so always likes to be outside and you can't pet it even though we've had her for years it's just one of those cats i don't know if it was abused when it was a kitten 

188.89 191.60 A: mhm 

190.31 195.90 B: but it you know if you pet it you can pet it for a minute and then after a while it just you know whack at you 

195.54 196.88 A: (( mhm ha )) 

196.26 208.17 B: so um the cat stays outside usually at night and then the other one stays inside but when the when one of them has to come in and eat and stuff it has to pass the other one on the stairs and so 

204.51 206.19 A: mhm 

208.50 212.10 B: [laughter] actually the other one will wait like hide behind the door 

212.01 224.22 B: so that when the gray one comes in it'll pounce on the on the outdoor cat the indoor cat but then at the same time the gray one will hide and then the the white one will try to go out and the gray one will pounce on him 

224.07 228.44 B: [laughter] so i mean they've been living together for you know 

224.19 225.24 A: wow 

228.21 229.33 A: (( [laughter] )) 

228.60 231.89 B: probably six seven years and they still don't get along 

232.23 233.76 B: [laughter] 

233.69 234.78 A: (( wow [mn] )) 

234.12 235.81 B: so that's really funny 

236.17 246.44 B: but he just comes in eats and leaves you know it's just like a street cat you know just like stays around but you know it's not like one of those cuddly cats like the other one 

246.08 248.17 A: oh hey we got a kitten 

248.26 251.72 B: oh you have a little kitten did you find it or did you i mean 

249.60 253.22 A: ah nah th- we got it at the s._p._c._a. w- 

252.90 261.20 B: oh that's the way to do it yeah and i think it's so stupid when people go and spend hundreds of dollars to buy an animal in a pet store 

254.35 255.85 A: yeah 

258.07 261.81 A: (( i mean yeah and they already had their shots )) 

261.26 264.12 B: when there's oh that's cool yeah

265.08 268.23 B: (( the s._p._c._a. they they already give 'em their shots )) 

267.32 274.24 A: i mean you go to a pet store you probably get worms and stuff like that i mean i'm not a big cat lover 'cause they they have attitudes 

270.51 271.70 B: exactly 

274.21 276.40 B: yeah yeah they do have attitudes 

274.57 275.61 A: (( you know ))
