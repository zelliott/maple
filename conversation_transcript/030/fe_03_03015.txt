148.27 149.35 A: right 

148.74 157.43 B: but um i don't know i i went to talk to a a counselor he he kind of discouraged me because at the time that i talked to him 

157.28 167.42 B: i think i was thirty years old and they he was talking about he wanted you know they were looking for younger people you know and he would he told me how much time i had to put into it 

166.88 169.42 A: yeah it's a long long path 

168.87 172.49 B: yeah and it's a lot of money and plus i watch um

186.80 193.06 A: that's enough you know yeah that's enough um so that's that's so you've always had dogs in your family 

192.49 200.94 B: we've always had animals um especially dogs we've always had a dog my mom and my grandmother you know they've always had pets 

200.81 210.34 B: and i have a uncle that always brought strays home so i don't know i guess i'm just taking over or something [laughter] yeah but um i love 

206.81 208.91 A: (( hey well good for you )) 

209.56 213.14 A: hey i- i'd rather have them living with you than out in the street 

212.39 216.49 B: yeah i mean you know it's it's terrible it's it's it's terrible 

216.27 227.99 B: um i always it seems like i'm always end up taking care of somebody else's pet you know which i don't mind but it's not fair because you know the life they live before they get to me is pretty bad you know what i'm saying 

227.60 231.03 A: yeah it's yeah it's hard for the pets to r- 

228.16 229.09 B: so 

231.13 238.22 A: it's just like people you know if you don't take care of them you know it's going to be hard when they get to a g- even a good master if they've 

232.33 233.71 B: yeah 

237.50 238.90 B: right 

238.30 241.85 A: been like damaged you know before but ah 

239.59 243.92 B: right right but they seem to really adjust i mean 

243.42 244.81 A: that's good yeah 

244.06 256.29 B: it de- it depends sometimes they're just left you know fending for themselves out on the streets but once they become ah a pet of someone they seem to adjust very well and they seem to be very loyal 

256.16 257.08 A: yeah 

256.38 264.38 B: you know they're very loyal they come in when you tell 'em they they're they're very obedient they don't none of my cats ever made a mess 

264.26 266.75 B: you know they always went to the kitty litter 

266.54 279.75 B: which means that i guess someone else had them before so they were trained they always went to the kitty litter they never scratched up anything i've been fortunate in that area and um i have asthma but i they don- the only thing that affects me with them is the ah kitty litter 

279.63 280.58 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

280.12 293.36 B: so i can't i have to hurry up and scoop it up 'cause you know that affects me but other than that they sleep in my bed i i feed them you know and they don't they don't leave a real big mess so and they're pretty clean you know these are strays 

292.97 301.77 A: [noise] yeah no no that's good that's good i um i remember meeting a woman last year who ah she had like eight 

293.79 295.86 B: yeah yeah 

302.28 313.43 A: eight dogs or something like little puppies but she took 'em in from like one of those places where they starve the the animals to turn them into like ah you know warriors 

303.55 304.93 B: (( wow [laughter] )) 

304.96 306.19 B: yeah 

306.27 307.46 B: yeah 

309.18 310.72 B: yeah 

312.91 314.25 B: yeah 

313.45 321.71 A: you know those like places you hear about in north philly where they they find them in the basement all hungry and i was like ah hey that's 

315.66 317.52 B: right right 

318.01 319.86 B: right exactly 

321.35 323.05 B: yeah that's terrible 

322.45 330.09 A: i mean i i couldn't imagine like you know i couldn't imagine having eight dogs anyway but like that you know it seems pretty risky to me but ah she 

324.58 325.38 B: (( no )) 

326.57 327.73 B: right 

329.81 340.13 B: i don't see how people can live around that you know what i'm saying to me animals are like children to me and you know if you've got any kind of conscience how could you let your children 

333.17 334.05 A: (( sh- yeah )) 

340.04 346.29 B: be stuffed in some dirty room and half way starve them and stuff like that that's not normal do you know what i'm saying 

345.94 352.14 A: no it's not clearly not well i can't say that you know pets are like children to me but 

347.44 348.47 B: yeah 

350.89 353.10 B: oh [laughter] 

352.49 357.98 A: [laughter] but you know and i don't really like animals but i'll say i'll say this 

355.48 356.44 B: (( oh really )) 

357.40 358.38 B: uh-huh 

358.40 371.89 A: you know it's screwed up if you're like starving the thing i mean you know what i mean i mean ha you know i don't but let's put it this way i don't believe in cruelty to animals you know what i mean i don't want 'em around me i don't want them in my house necessarily but you know 

360.78 362.09 B: yeah 

362.15 363.73 B: yeah 

366.89 368.26 B: right okay 

369.33 370.34 B: yeah

373.70 376.38 A: there's a you know there's the- 

375.49 380.42 B: a humane a humane thing about it yeah right right 

376.68 385.90 A: yeah humane right exactly exactly so um but i it's funny how many people in this city that to me ah have 

386.22 389.51 A: dogs particularly dogs and big dogs 

386.86 387.97 B: right 

387.99 390.26 B: right yeah

394.08 395.55 B: (( yeah )) 

394.98 398.32 A: um but m- my wife tells me that's because ah 

398.56 403.15 A: eh a a lot of the times big dogs make less noise actually 

402.57 403.65 B: okay 

403.16 408.76 A: i i don't know if that's true but like that's why people in the city sometimes like the bigger dogs 

408.20 409.10 B: okay 

409.10 410.17 A: what do you think [noise] 

409.26 413.99 B: yeah because ah it seem like well smaller she's kind of right because 

413.88 428.22 B: smaller dogs are kind of hyper they're real hyper i guess because of their size or whatever and bigger dogs they don't really bark as much they bark if there's an intruder or if it's somebody they're not familiar with eh but other than that they really don't bark 

417.63 418.58 A: right 

426.53 427.27 A: right 

427.60 430.18 A: they don't sit and yap all day yeah 

429.01 432.63 B: yeah but a little dog he'll bark at everything and an- anything 

432.25 434.19 A: yeah exactly exactly 

432.86 435.48 B: yeah so you know she's right about that 

435.05 437.46 A: that's cool um 

435.73 437.04 B: yeah

443.19 446.68 A: sunnyvale that's like in the l._a. area right right 

443.80 444.82 B: yeah 

445.22 448.64 B: yeah right e- exactly it's almost closer to san francisco
