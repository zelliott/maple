61.27 62.94 A: who um 

63.07 65.22 A: it's weird ah

139.42 140.37 B: mhm

456.48 457.42 B: [noise] 

459.52 469.40 A: you know they said it's you know sometimes it's controversial sometimes it's not but they said you'll basically be talking to a stranger and i guess they monitor it 

464.66 465.41 B: (( mhm ))

489.64 493.75 A: let me ask you something i this was something i was always curious 

490.68 491.49 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

493.95 496.66 A: when someone rings a doorbell 

496.69 499.86 A: dogs gravitate to 

500.00 503.90 A: the door i mean either they get excited or angry or whatever 

503.91 508.54 A: when someone rings a doorbell normally cats will run and hide 

508.64 509.41 B: (( oh )) 

509.68 517.30 A: you know especially like if it's a kid or something like that ah that's something i always wondered [noise] um 

517.52 518.65 A: i guess 

518.93 522.04 A: how i mean why the different reactions 

522.08 526.98 A: that you would get from that i mean are your dogs the type that get excited when people come 

523.56 524.12 B: (( [mn] )) 

526.82 530.25 B: it sounds like um a sense of survival kind of thing you know 

529.87 531.36 A: mhm 

530.75 531.98 B: but um 

532.39 537.27 B: you know they get they they get excited they they're like um even like ah 

535.88 536.54 A: (( [noise] )) 

537.39 540.46 B: like i'll wake up at like four thirty in the morning and ah 

540.69 551.38 B: there'll be a dog barking out in the distance and i'll i'll realize it's a different bark and i'm thinking maybe somebody's come back into the neighborhood kind of thing because it's kind of like a summer kind of place and i'm thinking 

547.90 548.89 A: yeah 

549.90 550.85 A: uh-huh 

553.43 559.24 B: [lipsmack] you know the the dogs are like you know she she wants to bark but she doesn't bark loud she does like these um 

559.20 573.53 B: she pepper barks she pepper she ah she uses these under undertone things and they're like it's not out loud it's to herself she's like speaking to herself but every once in a while they if it came out loud she would 

560.57 561.13 A: (( [mn] )) 

564.96 565.99 A: mhm 

573.47 579.21 B: she would burst but on the most part she's really she's just talking to herself 

579.09 586.14 A: well see that's a- i mean their hearing has to be i mean it's legendary what they say about the hearing but i 

579.27 580.96 B: kind of thinking about it 

586.22 586.78 A: (( [cough] )) 

587.07 599.89 A: myself and my sons we deliver papers in the morning it's like a second job for me and like i'm out there four o'clock in the morning and there are times where i mean i don't even get out of the car sometime 

590.96 591.86 B: uh-huh 

593.69 594.63 B: yeah
