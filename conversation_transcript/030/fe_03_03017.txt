395.10 398.08 B: they really in a way they wanted 

398.32 401.10 B: you know they would have wanted to really kind of ah 

401.50 413.76 B: you know possibly maybe get you know have a dog for ah my brother sister and i but um you know i guess i mean it's a lot of responsibility i mean i'll i'll say that probably 

412.81 413.56 A: (( yeah right )) 

413.98 417.21 B: you know i i wouldn't really probably disagree with their 

417.05 418.54 B: um decision 

418.44 432.19 B: you know growing up there 'cause you know it's basically it's not whether or not i had the commitments whether or not they could have the commitment to really kind of properly raise the dog i would have been there just to probably assist and walk it but they would have done most of the rai- you 

429.63 430.40 A: (( yeah right )) 

432.11 441.06 B: know raising of ah the dog there my father was a policeman and worked shift work and my mother also worked too so they didn't really have the time 

437.15 437.97 A: okay 

440.64 442.46 A: yeah well 

441.15 447.52 B: but ah my yeah but you know i'll i'll bring lily over to my parents' house and they they love her you know 

446.59 447.40 A: uh-huh 

447.64 448.37 A: good 

447.67 460.17 B: and ah they've always said that when i come home with when i bring lily over they say you know growing up you've always asked for a dog and they're glad to see that you know i'm happy and that you know my wife and i we take such good care of her 

460.01 460.77 A: mhm 

460.16 465.10 B: and ah you know at night there she sleeps right in bed with us we have a little blanket that says 

463.20 463.99 A: really 

465.70 467.32 B: this al- um 

467.46 473.30 B: i'm trying to think what it says ah my baby's ah first blanket or or something [laughter] 

472.23 474.16 A: sleeps on the bed with you 

473.91 476.30 B: yeah she sleeps righ- right between us 

476.15 477.24 A: (( wow )) 

476.34 481.87 B: and it gets yeah it's um what's funny is like if we're sleeping 

481.53 482.10 A: (( mm )) 

481.94 491.78 B: lily a part of her has to touch one one of us like whether it's my leg or you know she has to be you know snuggle up against us 

484.71 487.38 A: hm 

491.50 492.70 A: right 

491.84 498.83 B: and ah intentionally my wife or i will move so we're not touching her and she'll squirm back just to touch us 

496.44 497.12 A: right 

498.68 499.58 A: (( right )) 

498.95 503.43 B: i guess you know i guess a sense of security there and it's a 

502.33 506.23 A: well they're all domestic animals think of the owner as the parent 

505.86 507.14 B: yeah 

506.99 512.31 A: and it's it's and dogs like to sleep sort of in piles as it were um 

511.72 513.03 B: yeah 

512.44 515.10 A: just that's interesting yeah yeah uh-huh [mn] 

514.17 518.93 B: i'll tell ya i mean if we're on the couch she'll jump right on us and lie right on our chest 

518.64 519.82 A: (( right right )) 

519.02 521.09 B: and you know i 

521.50 530.36 B: sometimes it's better to have her on top of you than a than a blanket 'cause her body temperature is right around i- it's about one o a hundred and one 

530.46 531.95 B: to one o two 

531.97 540.07 B: so you can definitely that that's a few degrees difference between us and them you can you can tell the difference there you know like if she's ah if 

537.74 538.76 A: pounds 

540.18 545.59 B: she lays down right on our feet or something sh- she keeps them you know nice and warm there [laughter] 

545.25 546.96 A: that's twenty pounds on you 

546.69 551.54 B: oh yeah oh you can't really tell that i mean you think of twenty pounds like a lot but 

551.01 552.25 A: yeah 

551.83 558.57 B: y- you know it's it's a little different how she i guess positions herself and rests her paws on your on your feet and 

557.94 559.32 A: (( yeah okay )) 

558.71 562.29 B: but cats i'm i'm allergic to cats 

562.00 563.47 A: yeah a lot of people are 

562.46 567.38 B: um i don't know why it's maybe the dander or 

568.30 569.36 B: um 

569.60 575.32 B: but i i would imagine i alwa- i always thought like some dog fur and and cat fur was almost similar 

575.29 578.86 A: yeah well it's cat fur is is i would say lighter dogs 

578.22 579.29 B: yeah 

578.97 582.44 A: dog hair is is generally thicker 

582.08 583.35 B: yeah 

582.61 583.66 A: (( but um )) 

583.70 590.76 A: but ah yeah it's it's it's a good domestic animal he's um he's companionable he's he's 

590.12 591.99 B: yeah 

590.89 599.56 A: that's a slight inde- independence streak where he's doesn't like have to be around but whenever i come home and come in the door he like runs to the door and 

598.52 599.58 B: okay
