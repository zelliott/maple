108.21 109.97 A: she won't get much bigger 

110.80 112.71 A: so but she's spoiled [laughter]

127.52 130.10 B: (( dog [noise] )) 

129.35 136.90 A: and we just we have fixed it so she can't get in the street and nothing can get a hold of her you know 

137.17 141.16 A: but then of course we walk like i say we walk her morning and night 

141.51 142.80 B: mhm 

141.80 144.91 A: and we take her outside of the yar- i mean then but 

146.55 147.40 A: yeah 

146.63 152.15 B: so i- was the dog something to help teach your kids responsibility and 

152.24 160.99 A: yeah my my little girl more or less she's well she'll be nine so she's not real little but yeah kind of to teach them the responsibility 

152.38 154.28 B: how to take care of something 

161.26 162.30 A: (( um )) 

163.01 166.24 A: just kind of a s- you know for a fun thing for them 

166.35 167.22 A: that they 

167.41 171.16 A: they dress her up and take her to the pet shows or whatever 

171.31 173.60 A: (( you know something just for them )) 

172.28 174.46 B: well that's good 

173.83 175.06 A: and 

175.16 177.10 A: i well she just has become 

178.41 179.79 A: (( just a part of the fam- )) 

179.82 183.33 A: family we don't leave very often without her so 

183.34 184.22 B: (( uh-huh )) 

184.38 188.41 A: so she stays in the house most of the time because she's so small and i'm scared something go- 

188.75 191.92 A: would get in while we were gone and get her but 

190.97 192.85 B: right 

192.48 193.24 A: (( so )) 

193.48 195.66 A: and she loves the snow so that 

196.31 197.75 A: i mean she's kind of 

197.93 200.46 A: one that can live in e- either weather 

200.83 202.87 B: mhm 

201.51 204.23 A: hot's a little harder than the winter 

204.54 209.49 A: but she does does pretty good what kind of dog do you usually take care of 

208.93 212.28 B: uh my friend has two greyhounds 

211.65 214.64 A: ooh i like greyhounds [laughter] 

213.79 215.75 B: and they're wonderful dogs 

215.39 216.70 A: they are they're 

217.11 219.50 A: they're just a little more active than 

219.63 221.58 B: well ac- i mean that's 

221.67 232.52 B: i thought that too but when you sit around with the greyhounds you find out that they're kind of boring unless you play with them because all they do all day is rest and sleep 

223.13 223.99 A: oh really 

228.96 230.31 A: oh really hm 

232.74 238.38 B: like these are rescued dogs so they've already done the track stuff and 

237.68 238.71 A: right 

238.63 247.56 B: so now it's just sit around eat sit around go for a walk it it's the perfect kind of dog to dog sit because you there's nothing to do 

247.74 248.57 A: yeah 

249.03 255.12 A: i didn't know if they were kind of like a lap dog i mean you know that would actually sit still and enjoy 

249.16 250.19 B: (( but they )) 

255.33 263.83 B: oh yeah well they tow you can sit down and watch t._v. and they'll just lie there next to you or you can pet them all night and they love all the attention 

261.93 262.72 A: (( right )) 

263.90 273.41 B: but the best thing about them is that they they're pretty smart and if you tell them to do something they pretty much learn how to do it so 

272.67 273.50 A: hm 

273.46 276.91 B: and you can train them really well i mean i think that's part of the reason why 

277.13 280.65 B: greyhounds are so popular for racing is because they're easier to train 

279.94 282.05 A: probably probably 

282.30 285.39 A: well this is she w- we got her when she was eight weeks old 

285.92 290.27 A: and first we brought her in she'd never been outside 

290.41 294.27 A: from the place we got her she'd been inside had never 

290.76 292.12 B: mhm 

294.70 296.74 A: never seen the outdoors 

296.78 298.96 A: and she was so 

299.46 303.44 A: that she didn't want to get off the sidewalk she didn't like the grass she didn't you 

303.49 306.45 A: know didn't want to get her feet wet nothing 

305.46 306.84 B: wow 

307.02 313.38 A: and so we had a little trouble getting her housebroke you know those type thi- 

314.12 315.56 A: but now she's 

314.20 317.11 B: that's a very sheltered dog 

316.34 324.32 A: oh yes she was and now she'll go out and play in the snow she run she has fur- snowballs in her fur 

324.34 326.23 B: mhm 

324.47 325.53 A: i mean 

325.54 327.53 A: but we've had to work with her 

327.88 332.59 A: because she didn't even know what like the rain and stuff was she didn't like that she was 

332.49 334.56 B: [laughter] 

333.05 338.72 A: all set against that [laughter] so that's why we that's where she got her name because she was 

338.77 340.48 A: because we call her percy 

340.85 341.80 A: but 

342.14 343.90 B: okay i can see that 

342.76 350.70 A: i just had never had a dog that was like that [laughter] i'm not used to that i said look you've got to go outside i don't care 

350.84 353.30 A: but she learns pretty good 

353.32 359.19 B: [noise] well yeah e- especially if you want her to be h- housebroken and then take her outside to potty train 

358.72 368.35 A: well and when we walked her she didn't like it because she didn't she didn't want to be in the grass she didn't like the gravel i mean you know it was hard for her 

368.64 372.78 A: i mean we spent a lot of time just working on that just to get her to walk 

372.94 375.98 A: um hadn't been around very many people 

373.16 375.03 B: mhm 

376.08 385.92 A: which concerned me at first but she took right up with the kids of course now she's kind of gotten where she's protective of us of all of us 

385.75 387.50 B: well that's good 

386.27 387.14 A: so 

387.51 389.31 A: she just 

389.64 397.09 A: she's kind of kind of a different dog [laughter] i had a poodle when i was younger and completely different 

397.12 399.14 B: yeah 

397.92 399.39 A: i mean he was 

399.55 401.51 A: all laid back and 

402.16 404.27 A: this one you kind of have to 

404.30 405.66 A: push her a little back 

405.75 409.63 B: have you thought about getting another dog to to play with her 

408.66 410.39 A: no i 

410.56 418.33 A: i don't because i have the two kids and my son has a disability and it's really hard for just 

418.46 420.76 A: to make time for the one you know [laughter] 

420.63 422.70 B: yeah 

421.54 425.89 A: with us running him back and forth to the doctor and stuff it's it's hard 

426.22 431.80 A: and my husband works construction and he's gone a lot and i just 

432.23 437.41 A: i think one's enough [laughter] i mean we have cats and stuff outside but 

436.87 441.73 B: okay yeah so there there is something going around that he that the dog could play with 

437.77 438.89 A: you know that's 

441.50 445.98 A: oh yeah oh yeah she loves she loves the cats and the cats love her 

446.19 447.14 A: um 

447.25 448.66 A: i had a dog 

448.94 455.61 A: that lived outside that i kept outside and he would even let my cats sleep with him in the doghouse so 

455.97 460.30 A: my cats are real gentle and loveable so they don't mind the dog 

460.79 463.87 B: that's interesting that cats and dogs aren't always 

460.87 461.76 A: but 

463.98 474.56 B: enemies like that like everyone makes them out to be such opposites and yet i always hear stories about dogs and cats like just being best friends and playing around and 

472.57 476.18 A: i mean they would share their food bowl their water bowl 

476.42 479.16 A: i mean they'd sleep in the doghouse together 

479.75 484.10 A: you know even when she had kittens he never would aggress 

481.86 483.03 B: mhm 

484.20 485.19 A: towards them 

485.78 493.75 A: he was always really nice to them you know now if somebody went to hurt the cat you know he would kind of get protective but 

493.82 495.61 A: that was the first dog i'd ever 

496.40 499.80 A: seen let a cat sleep in its house though 

499.08 501.12 B: yeah i've never heard of that 

500.23 503.46 A: [laughter] he was they'd get in there together and it 

503.81 505.12 A: it was like okay 

505.25 508.83 A: [laughter] and i kept telling the cat look you're going to get in trouble one of these days 

508.93 511.31 A: but he never did he 

509.02 510.58 B: [laughter] 

511.33 512.92 A: he didn't like it 

513.72 515.48 A: (( um i don't know )) 

515.72 523.85 A: now this one i don't think he would have liked this dog i don't he wasn't too much on other dogs being around in his territory 

523.87 529.20 B: yeah sometimes they're like that th- they just don't want other dogs around because it's 

524.73 525.62 A: but 

529.59 532.96 B: one of those possession things they're attention things 

532.33 534.33 A: yeah well he was 

534.50 536.92 A: fifty pounds he was a mix 

536.98 542.73 A: just a little of everything basically and i had to keep a log chain on him to keep him home 

543.15 547.01 B: oh he he would have run off yeah 

543.47 545.15 A: that's how strong he was 

545.99 547.88 A: because he'd just 

547.95 549.88 A: overpower anything else 

550.03 556.13 A: [laughter] but and that's why i was surprised that he would let something that little you know be near him 

556.23 559.15 A: but he never had a problem with it 

558.86 562.53 B: well i guess he knew that they were never going to be a threat 

559.21 559.80 A: (( so )) 

562.74 564.29 A: i guess not i'm 

564.98 570.61 A: he was comfortable with it i was even surprised for him to share you know food bowls and stuff that would be 

571.21 574.44 A: that's not something they do very of- [laughter] very often 

573.11 574.74 B: no not at all 

574.60 578.01 A: and he didn't have a problem with it he'd share 

578.59 582.00 A: so i don't i don't know they were un- unusual 

582.42 584.87 A: they're all different i guess and 

584.47 586.33 B: it sure sounds like it 

586.90 594.36 A: i don't know missouri's not missouri's not too bad if you've you know the animals some of them it's still too cold for in the winter 

594.70 597.72 A: i mean i've i've had several dogs and 

597.95 599.87 A: (( one of them was a little teacup ))
