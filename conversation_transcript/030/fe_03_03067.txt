127.62 136.18 B: until one found [mn] i found one that liked him and kind of got the best side of my dad i guess so we were allowed to keep it but i've always had pets 

134.69 136.85 A: mhm mhm yeah 

136.22 140.84 B: i i think it's good for children to be around pets and they don't grow grow up to be afraid of them 

140.55 141.38 A: yes 

141.61 147.06 B: but they are a lot of responsibility and usually it's the the mom that gets the responsibility 

145.80 147.78 A: [laughter] right [laughter] 

147.38 160.26 B: [laughter] my kids have dragged home everything from snakes to puppies to kittens to most of the time i say no no no but you know after some talk we always decided we'd have one one or two pets for them 

159.76 164.29 A: yeah well when i was growing up we had a pet chicken 

164.70 166.24 B: oh really yeah 

165.48 171.07 A: yeah he used to follow my dad around he'd get a bucket to go feed the cow or something 

170.51 171.83 B: mhm 

171.12 174.60 A: and he'd always sneak this little chicken 

174.66 176.16 A: some of the food 

176.53 179.92 A: and every time she saw him with a bucket she came running 

179.51 188.20 B: isn't that funny you know i remember being when i was a kid around easter time we got a little chicken too my mom ended up calling it henry and it followed her around squeaked all the time 

187.75 188.88 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

188.54 197.98 B: um but we've had yeah we used to have little little chicks around easter time we'd get those and we had guinea pigs and but we surely didn't live on a farm i mean you must have had a farm if you had cows 

197.56 200.38 A: yeah we did i grew up on a farm 

198.59 199.59 B: yeah 

200.05 203.66 B: yeah well then you have a lot of pets outside and you can you have the room for 

203.56 208.49 A: yeah we had ah cows pigs chickens dogs cats 

203.76 204.73 B: for a lot of 

208.09 210.52 B: oh my god so you know how to take care of all of them huh 

210.04 211.41 A: (( ah yeah mhm )) 

211.14 212.80 B: oh my god 

212.67 214.38 A: yes i've milked cows 

215.01 216.08 B: really 

215.77 216.87 A: mhm 

216.38 217.76 B: oh my goodness 

217.95 219.92 B: but do you still live on live on a farm 

219.71 222.46 A: no i don't i live in in the city now 

221.96 223.43 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

222.69 225.35 A: i've been in the city for twenty seven years mm 

224.71 230.33 B: yeah yeah well that's where i am in the city but you know everybody has ah pets here 

230.49 239.13 B: you know we have ah dog parks now that you can actually take the dogs and take them off the leash 'cause you you're supposed to have dogs on a leash when you walk them you know but they 

238.08 239.80 A: yeah we are here 

239.44 245.51 B: yeah but they have specific parks that are built for just dogs and you can take the dogs and let 'em off do you have those too 

243.16 244.40 A: mhm 

245.47 247.84 A: no i had never heard of that 

247.21 254.09 B: yeah well you just take 'em there's a designated park they're called dog parks free no leashes and you let your you still have to watch your animals 

253.72 254.50 A: true 

254.19 257.89 B: it used to scare me to death because dogs come in all sizes you know 

256.93 258.54 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

257.95 264.69 B: and you know your own but you don't know the temperament of somebody else's but because so many of us live in apartments you know 

260.77 261.99 A: right 

264.74 270.87 B: the only way to get the animal's exercise that or take 'em down by the ocean but even there you're supposed to have them leashed 

270.59 271.64 A: (( yeah )) 

271.14 278.47 B: so it's pretty difficult you know unless you have the space for a dog that's why i've kinda picked just picked the cats because it's a lot easier for me 

274.12 275.15 A: yeah 

278.18 279.24 A: yeah 

279.05 280.21 B: (( you know )) 

280.49 286.80 B: so but they're still a lot of responsibility i'm always cleaning up after 'em and always seems to be cat hair somewhere but like 

286.02 287.50 A: oh yeah yeah 

287.08 294.37 B: like i said i wouldn't give them up for anything because they really are i'm not married they really are my best friends [laughter] 

293.68 295.24 A: well i'm not married either 

295.33 296.24 A: um 

296.40 297.34 B: (( [cough] )) 

296.85 301.52 A: but i said i don't have any pets i have a cat that thinks she lives here 

301.21 302.60 B: oh do you 

302.30 304.76 A: she lays on my patio all the time 

304.84 306.02 B: do you feed her 

305.66 309.98 A: no [laughter] and she looks fine she eats somewhere 

308.33 309.29 B: uh-huh 

309.92 310.98 B: oh she just 

310.08 315.09 A: but i don't know whether i don't know where she comes from or where she's supposed to be 

314.88 316.01 B: well somebody 

315.23 323.32 A: but she comes and lays on my patio i don't know if she has a mean dog at her residence or what but [laughter] she seems to like it here 

319.69 321.71 B: [laughter] 

322.78 326.45 B: well she feels safe she must go home to eat and come back and rest at your house 

325.91 327.23 A: evidently 

326.70 329.57 B: oh that's funny and how long has she been outside your door 

329.90 332.40 A: oh she's been around for a year 

332.11 333.59 B: oh my god 

333.75 347.40 B: a friend of mine just told me the same thing that they bought a house up north somewhere and she said that she thinks the people just left their animal behind when they moved and she's has she and her husband have allergies and so they didn't let the cat in but she said 

342.00 343.10 A: mhm 

347.32 351.49 B: after six months watching it and then it started to rain one night they just couldn't help it 

351.19 352.12 A: [laughter] 

351.50 356.19 B: and so now they've adopted it and that's horrible when people do that just leave their animals behind 

353.04 354.15 A: yeah 

355.53 357.13 A: oh it is 

356.62 361.73 B: you know don't there's so many organizations now that will take your pets for you if you can't 

360.44 361.54 A: yeah 

362.21 369.08 B: so it's kind of sad you know and it's not a very good way to teach your children how to um take care of children i mean pets 

369.18 370.58 A: we just had a 

370.66 378.98 A: there was a story on t._v. i think yesterday or the day before where this lady had kept taking in pets and she wasn't taking care of them 

378.63 380.26 B: (( oh isn't that horrible )) 

379.76 382.89 A: and ah she's going to be prosecuted 

382.63 384.07 B: yeah that happens 

382.98 392.58 A: and she should be well like she took 'em because she thought she could help 'em i think i think she really did but she just had more than she could take care of 

384.15 385.06 B: mhm 

387.96 389.05 B: right 

389.70 390.72 B: right 

392.05 402.33 B: yeah i don't really believe that these people that i've heard of that those kind of cases too i don't think that they originally started to to to be hurtful to the animals i think they felt they could make a difference 

401.70 402.64 A: (( yeah well )) 

402.36 405.66 B: but you know it's very expensive to keep animals i 

404.82 406.73 A: she couldn't afford to feed them 

406.20 417.42 B: mhm i it seems like i every time i turn around it's didn't i just go out and buy i try to buy the food and litter and everything i need for them once twice a month and it seems like i'm always it's always on my list [laughter] 

414.36 415.28 A: yeah 

416.73 417.95 A: mhm 

417.75 426.80 B: so it it can get away with you i i i think if you have way too many animals i've seen that i just don't know how people can live with that many animals in their house you know 

421.63 422.53 A: yeah 

426.17 427.63 A: (( no [mn] )) 

427.25 437.43 B: [mn] cats are very they can be really smelly as as clean as i think i am you know i'm always still worried about somebody coming in 'cause cat cat boxes are nasty 

437.20 440.68 A: yeah you have to keep 'em cleaned and 

437.86 439.33 B: and they're easy to train 

440.02 443.42 B: yeah 'cause cats are very easy to train that's the beauty of them 

442.05 443.23 A: (( oh yeah )) 

443.70 446.32 B: and not and not having to walk them you know 

446.64 455.32 B: but we've we've heard about cases like that too um where the animals they just finally go in there or [sigh] i think it just gets away from them too much you know 

454.89 456.18 A: yeah 

456.12 458.25 B: [mn] so is this your first call 

458.02 459.14 A: yes
