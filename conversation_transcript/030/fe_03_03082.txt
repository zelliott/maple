277.05 284.97 B: um and that's that's the food that's the food that [noise] works the best we had um the eukanuba weren't happy with that 

284.99 290.22 B: and then we had iams i guess it's i think iams is made by the same brand as eukanuba 

290.53 295.17 B: and now um they eat science diet and they really really like it a lot 

294.86 295.60 A: (( hm ))

307.49 308.91 B: do they make um 

307.52 310.50 A: (( [mn] do you do you have different bowls for each of the dogs )) 

309.89 311.37 B: [noise] yep 

311.12 314.00 A: oh okay so will that that kinda 

313.97 314.82 B: (( [noise] )) 

314.13 315.81 A: narrows down the fight 

315.42 325.70 B: yeah we have well the bi- the little dog was eating the big dog's food so we had to get one of the bowls up propped up plus it was better on the big dog's back so he wouldn't have to bend over to eat 

326.55 332.41 B: so we got one of the bowls that stands real tall so the little dog can't reach it and neither can the cat 

327.15 327.81 A: (( mm )) 

332.63 335.42 B: but the cat still tries to eat the little the puppy's food 

335.79 337.00 A: really 

336.39 339.52 B: mhm oh yeah cat loves it 

338.14 342.06 A: you see and i would think that that would not interest her one bit 

341.44 348.58 B: oh it does and they wanna eat her food too but we put her food downstairs and neither one of our dogs go downstairs for some reason 

349.13 350.67 B: they stay on one floor 

351.74 353.73 A: but you have a big yard for them or 

353.28 354.10 B: (( ah hm )) 

353.99 355.05 A: (( oh good )) 

354.46 359.21 B: yep we just actually got it fenced in because our big dog kept running away 

359.72 361.45 B: he um we had him 

361.46 362.52 B: chained 

362.66 363.62 B: to 

364.12 366.39 B: the house like a physical 

366.74 369.41 B: bolt into the foundation of the house 

369.53 375.35 B: and he just ripped it right out of the house ran away just running down the road with like a ten foot chain and a 

375.56 377.42 B: screw on the end of it 

377.57 379.44 B: and he was gone for twelve hours 

379.12 393.10 A: [mn] twelve oh that's not bad i my dog when i had lived you know back at home um had been gone for like three or four days and we thought we'd never see her again and do you know she just came like walking down the street all scroungy and you know like hey i'm home i had my party 

393.04 394.72 B: how how long was she gone 

394.52 396.79 A: ah between three and four days 

396.44 398.08 B: (( ah really )) 

397.52 400.70 A: and we couldn't believe like she didn't get hit by a car 

400.90 407.46 A: ah because we had her brother at one time too and um my father took one to dog obedience school 

407.63 419.23 A: and the brother didn't go and he was shoveling snow one day and they were still puppies and there was a dog across the street and shane was the name of the the boy dog he ran right across the street under a van 

419.65 420.84 B: oh 

419.83 423.04 A: and and he thought like one dog would talk to the other dog 

423.50 426.19 A: you know like don't run across the street and i'm going 

425.12 426.30 B: mhm 

426.41 432.03 A: they're like nine months and i was home with like strep throat and i watched it from inside the house 

431.44 433.04 B: oh goodness 

432.49 435.13 A: [laughter] it was quite traumatic as a kid 

433.59 435.36 B: that's my worst fear 

435.69 436.65 A: yeah 

436.02 438.73 B: we have the backyard fenced in and it's a nice 

437.98 439.12 A: well we did too 

438.96 439.89 B: yeah 

439.30 447.06 A: but my father brought them out front figuring oh they you know she's been to dog obedience school and you know she'll talk to the other one oh yeah well that was a mistake 

441.57 442.73 B: exactly 

447.34 460.61 A: you know but ah my parents had a big big fenced in yard they had like two hundred foot deep for the the dog to run around and then ah i moved the next town over and i have like um a cubby [laughter] it's almost the size of the cubicle at work [laughter] 

458.10 458.92 B: we have 

459.94 466.55 B: [laughter] ours is a pretty decent size and we actually fenced it in he has a nice area back there 

466.59 470.90 B: to run round in plus we have a nice trail up here where um 

470.91 481.05 B: every day i can take him and it's like a cross country trail it's like through the woods and it's real wide you could drive a car through it but nobody does um the actual the high school 

481.06 486.07 B: for the area that i live in they run through there so it's perfect everybody walks their dogs and 

486.55 487.11 A: (( mm )) 

486.65 491.93 B: you know i- it so every time you go up there and it's actually a big fenced in area it's a dog park 

491.93 493.57 A: what what state are you in 

492.23 493.57 B: so you could actually 

493.97 495.64 B: (( pennsylvania yep oh )) 

495.00 497.05 A: oh okay so you're just next door 

497.52 498.73 A: 'cause i'm in jersey 

498.79 499.75 B: okay 

500.44 502.57 B: (( yep i'm in pennsylvania pittsburgh )) 

502.91 504.49 B: and um 

502.92 503.71 A: oh 

504.89 511.19 B: we take him up there and i let him loose and where the chained in area is so he can play with other dogs and stuff it's a real it's really nice 

512.15 517.49 B: so we take him up there once a day because i feel so bad 'cause they're they're home all day by themselves 

518.18 520.17 A: good yeah but they do have each other 

519.85 521.43 B: yeah [laughter] 

520.84 527.54 A: no seriously i mean you know they may be bored without you know humans around but they do still have each other 

523.10 524.46 B: (( yeah it was sad )) 

527.19 531.82 B: it was sad when it was just the one dog here but now that there's two dogs 

531.59 532.62 A: mhm 

532.54 539.94 B: they keep each other company and if i even put one in a cage like if they're bad we have we have the crate that we trained them in 

539.97 546.25 B: and we just use it as a reserve we call it the jail [laughter] so if they're bad the one goes in the jail 

542.71 543.71 A: [laughter] 

546.65 547.60 A: oh 

547.46 552.95 B: and they'll cry they'll they have to be out you know where the cage is they have to be there and they just stare at the other one 

553.68 556.86 B: it's crazy the way the way that they get along because they're 

557.20 563.38 B: our husky is over a hundred pounds and the pekinese isn't even five isn't even five pounds 

563.64 564.60 A: wow 

564.17 565.54 B: [laughter] 

565.92 567.47 B: [laughter] so he can 

567.57 572.88 B: sometimes if they are playing around he'll grab it by its tail and like whip her around 

573.87 576.03 A: over do it just a little bit oh [laughter] 

575.50 577.24 B: yeah and that's when 

577.28 579.40 B: that's when he goes in his cage 

579.96 582.45 B: and then she'll have the run of the house for a little bit 

582.82 585.00 B: and then she'll do something that's mean 

585.66 591.81 B: and then she'll go in the cage but she normally every time she goes in the cage she'll go to the bathroom in there just to spite us [laughter] [laughter] 

590.43 592.44 A: (( ah oh )) 

593.91 598.57 A: yeah by the way that's like the second child [laughter] [laughter] 

596.51 599.48 B: yes it is by far and
