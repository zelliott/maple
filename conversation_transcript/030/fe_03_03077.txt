196.71 199.90 A: i don't know no he's really big i don't know 

199.75 202.09 B: yeah i've only seen small ones 

201.79 203.12 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

202.84 203.62 B: oh 

204.00 214.24 B: no well my milo is the dog he um he won't come upstairs so he doesn't i i d- i still have to use my alarm clock [laughter] well now it's the baby but you know

221.33 226.12 B: and um but no he won't come upstairs like even if we ask him to he won't 

225.85 227.52 A: he knows that's off limits 

226.21 228.51 B: he just won't i'm sorry 

228.28 231.46 A: he knows that's off limits or he just doesn't like climbing stairs 

229.35 239.86 B: yeah no yeah he's it it's been off limits since he's you know since we got him and now if if we'll if we sit in the top of the stairs and we call him he won't come

248.11 250.56 B: yeah my husband [laughter] 

249.73 257.74 A: oh okay i i think that's i'm with the cat i think the cat favors me more than the rest of the family just because i'm the one that feeds the cat
