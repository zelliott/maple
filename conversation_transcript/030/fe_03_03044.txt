91.29 96.70 B: we had ah two cats a kitten and a well a kitten and a cat and they 

96.61 110.23 B: both died recently my daughter i have a twelve year old [laughter] she had a black a male cat that was really i mean she was really in love with that cat and he got run over by a car

109.46 110.59 A: oh 

110.57 116.41 B: [lipsmack] and that was really hard for us and she um 

113.63 115.28 A: (( yeah i can imagine )) 

117.32 124.59 B: she thought we both talked about getting another cat because our cat was lonely you could tell he was really attached to that cat and when he died 

123.60 128.34 A: uh-huh well since we're talking here i've got to ask an obvious question 

127.63 128.44 B: okay 

128.41 130.57 A: how do you know when a cat's lonely 

130.50 140.61 B: um he needed a lot more attention when we had the kitten he could play with the kitten and once the kitten was gone we had to give him constant attention and 

132.98 134.07 A: (( okay )) 

138.82 144.68 A: oh something like a kid huh ah there you go now it makes a lot more sense 

140.71 144.18 B: yeah he it was it was a big 

144.15 158.71 B: yeah it was a and we have a dog we have a german shepherd and they were close but it's still not the same he can't play with the shepherd the the little the cat that died the black one did play with the shepherd a lot his m- his whole head would be wet because the dog would have his head in his mouth 

146.82 147.92 A: mhm 

157.52 159.50 A: [laughter] 

158.81 161.86 B: but the older one didn't play the same way 

162.01 166.49 B: so and then we got this other kitten that we have now we have got a female 

166.79 170.90 B: and then not too long after we got her my other cat got sick 

171.00 182.80 B: and after paying two hundred and fifty dollars to try to save his life he ended up having to be put to sleep because he had pneumonia he said either pneumonia or a foxtail in his lungs but it was going to be 

175.95 177.91 A: (( mm mm )) 

180.17 181.93 A: (( mm [mn] )) 

182.75 190.97 B: really expensive for surgery and they couldn't guarantee they could save him even if i did it so i couldn't afford to do that so 

187.47 189.62 A: (( mm i see mhm )) 

190.98 199.96 B: we put him to sleep and so now we have one cat again who's lonely [laughter] so my daughter's got someone bringing a kitten by this afternoon 

194.30 195.95 A: (( mm )) 

200.10 202.03 B: and she wants another black one 

200.43 201.13 A: (( p- ))

207.46 212.77 B: um yeah we had a dog when i was young that um 

213.17 217.59 B: [laughter] i brought another dog into the backyard so they could play 

217.06 218.67 A: [laughter] 

217.70 229.59 B: and they sure did play [laughter] she ended up pregnant [laughter] so we had we went through puppies that time i would not want to through p- in fact i got my shepherd i love shepherds he's they're

229.91 230.73 B: (( do you )) 

237.73 240.22 B: shepherds are really good dogs 

239.61 252.90 A: yeah and my wife was like what kind of dog are we going to get she says she likes ah she was like she looks at the little bitty chow dogs she says i love them they're so beautiful when they're a puppy i say yeah but their temperament is not good you know 

246.60 247.74 B: (( uh oh i )) 

251.28 254.63 B: that's right chows are meaner than shepherds are 

253.43 258.19 A: yeah well actually shepherds i don't think they're mean along kids 

257.80 260.03 B: n- well you know the best 

259.15 261.32 A: you help enlighten me 

260.71 263.00 B: [laughter] um actually 

263.65 267.94 B: german shepherds if you if you get a male i think you'd be better off 

267.58 268.71 A: oh okay 

268.06 275.66 B: actually the males are have a little bit better temper and if you got like a doberman pinscher the females have a better temperament so it kind of depends on the breed 

273.39 274.42 A: yeah 

275.15 278.15 A: they do say that the female shepherd is tough 

277.72 290.57 B: the female shepherd is harder yeah and yet the male doberman is harder so it kind of depends on what you breed you get but chow chows are nasty biters dalmatians too both of those dogs yeah they're both really 

285.82 286.89 A: yeah 

288.07 289.10 A: oh really

295.15 304.33 B: german shepherds don't my mine is really friendly with people he's huge he's almost a hundred and twenty pounds he's way big but most of them are only about eighty five pounds 

300.77 301.72 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

304.14 311.20 B: but he's big but he's more like a european shepherd than the american shepherd he's got a straight back it's not sloped
