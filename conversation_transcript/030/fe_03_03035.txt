98.27 111.57 B: yes well when i was when i was growing up i had a dog and my dog's name was power i was about twelve and my brother gave it to me when he went to college because i was depressed because my brother was leaving

108.12 109.22 A: mhm 

111.18 112.39 A: yeah

130.61 131.97 A: (( oh )) 

131.01 135.78 B: because i was twelve and then right around thirteen or fourteen 

132.58 133.66 A: yes 

135.91 140.55 B: i unfortunately or fortunately got interested in girls and 

140.96 143.86 B: started to neglect my pet 

143.25 146.60 A: oh [laughter] 

144.22 146.99 B: so my sister 

147.09 150.26 B: inherited the job of feeding 

149.66 150.94 A: oh wow 

150.46 153.27 B: the pet which she did not like 

152.64 154.80 A: oh no [laughter] 

153.95 157.91 B: so eventually ah they gave my pet away 

157.63 160.02 A: oh i'm so sorry 

159.17 163.56 B: yeah well i was j- i wasn't ready for the responsibility of a pet 

162.55 164.75 A: you were prioritizing 

164.45 168.19 B: it was great for the for a couple or two weeks a couple or three weeks 

166.63 177.39 A: [laughter] that's too funny well i i've had my bird for two and a half years and and she's um she needs a lot of attention so 

169.33 170.22 B: yeah 

172.79 173.57 B: (( okay )) 

177.51 182.66 A: um i have to play with her or spend time with her probably about an hour a day 

182.79 191.05 A: um and i normally tickle her or you know she likes to try chew my fingers but she has a three hundred pound bite so 

189.98 192.31 B: (( that's what i was going to say how how big is she )) 

192.36 197.63 A: she's very large um because she's the second largest parrot so um 

197.75 200.38 A: i can't it's hard for me to i w- 

199.59 202.69 B: how much does she weigh just approximately 

201.22 207.39 A: she only she doesn't weigh a lot because she's mostly feathers um but she weighs about 

204.98 205.97 B: okay 

207.51 209.58 A: two and a half pounds 

208.88 210.86 B: oh that's a lot for a bird huh 

210.70 212.87 A: (( yeah and you know um )) 

212.89 225.39 A: she's probably as with her she has very long tail so from her the tip of her tail to the tip of her head she's probably waist high you know almost maybe f- for me anyway as a female not you as a guy maybe 

219.30 221.49 B: (( mm mm )) 

225.39 234.07 A: um so you know she's a very big pet and we take her out all the time into central park and walk around with her because she loves to be outside 

233.53 234.88 B: okay now 

234.90 235.94 B: you've got to 

235.99 239.54 B: help me with this visual how do you walk a bird 

237.52 238.95 A: mhm 

239.66 246.25 A: well she sits on my shoulder well well or she holds or i hold her on my arm yeah she doesn't walk on the ground 

241.32 242.44 B: okay 

246.03 251.55 B: no i was just trying to figure out okay now that's a trick [laughter] 

249.65 259.55 A: [laughter] and then um i put a little leash on her and go just in case you know she doesn't ever try to fly but um 

255.55 257.14 B: mhm 

258.56 259.71 B: just in case 

259.61 263.17 A: o- yeah just in case and her her wings are clipped anyway 

261.71 265.53 B: but may i ask what the value of your bird is oh 

265.08 273.18 A: well i don't know what it is today but at the time that i bought her um she cost like twenty four hundred 

273.26 282.41 A: which was sizeable and then i lost my job after that and i was like what did i do oh no but you know they live up to eighty years 

276.31 277.08 B: (( okay oh )) 

277.74 278.71 B: [laughter] 

281.79 283.11 B: really 

282.43 289.66 A: mhm so if i had bought a dog every twelve years i'm sure i'm sure i'll have spent that much 

286.29 287.40 B: exactly 

288.63 289.89 B: that's great 

290.05 292.69 B: so obviously you do not have kids 

292.48 296.03 A: no but why is it obvious i might have some one day 

294.85 303.35 B: no i'm just saying because the fact that ah it seems like you know with the well young kids and a big bird that would 

296.14 297.30 A: [laughter] 

302.48 305.75 A: i know that's what my husband keeps saying to me 

305.03 310.49 B: i would be i got a five year old okay and she would ride it oh sure 

305.84 306.94 A: yeah 

307.76 309.00 A: [laughter] 

310.11 322.36 A: you see well it it is a concern that we are um that we have to look into um i you know i'm willing to do whatever i can to try and make make um 

316.42 317.71 B: mhm 

322.49 326.87 A: a decent relationship there because you know she's very possessive over me 

326.35 327.69 B: mhm 

327.08 335.01 A: so if i um if i just you know a friend comes in and i give them a kiss hello on the cheek she tries to lunge at them 

334.75 337.38 B: (( i was going to say does she bite or scratch )) 

337.21 340.39 A: she bites and she bites hard and 

340.31 341.19 B: (( [mn] really )) 

340.47 351.10 A: yeah and if you know i- we were out on sunday and someone came up to us and he was really weird and she felt so uncomfortable and so she bites me when she's uncomfortable 

345.70 346.97 B: [laughter] 

349.29 350.15 B: (( what oh )) 

351.22 356.98 A: yeah so i got a quite a few nips from this from this creature my loving bird 

355.81 357.96 B: what does she eat 

358.09 359.01 A: um 

358.15 360.04 B: what do you feed your big bird 

359.92 366.84 A: well first of all she loves everything we eat like her favorites are p- ah pizza and pasta favorites by far 

362.05 362.92 B: okay 

364.77 365.71 B: really 

365.90 368.85 B: hey wouldn't that that doesn't hurt a bird 

368.33 383.13 A: no as long as it's in moderation i mean we don't feed it to her everyday and then otherwise she eats nuts and seeds and fruit and i give her vegetables um a very healthy diet i'm sure if i lived on it you know i'd be in good shape 

370.35 371.09 B: (( yeah yeah oh )) 

382.63 386.69 B: okay mhm how much does she eat like at one feeding 

386.09 390.74 A: well you know they're not like dogs they're not obsessively hungry 

390.07 391.28 B: mhm 

390.88 392.27 A: but um 

392.30 399.29 A: and of her own food she doesn't eat that much but if i'm giving her pizza she'll try and eat quite a lot you know 

397.53 398.62 B: [laughter] 

398.90 406.11 B: well i i guess what my question is then in like in a month all right how mu- how how often do you have to replenish her food supply 

402.31 403.52 A: yeah 

405.81 412.41 A: well i i replenish it i mean i give her fresh food most food everyday and i that's that's probably 

410.83 419.47 B: yeah but i'm i understand that but i'm i guess what i'm getting at is like do you buy thirty pounds of food or ten pounds or five pounds of food monthly or 

416.56 418.30 A: oh okay 

418.55 426.12 A: no i think i think um i think i probably only use up about of her specific food i probably only use about 

426.20 434.48 A: five or six pounds a month i would imagine but that's just her seeds and nuts and stuff and it doesn't include all the human food she eats 

427.78 428.79 B: i see 

434.02 435.54 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

434.64 435.65 A: (( you know )) 

435.66 438.31 A: so she's quite something to have in the home 

437.15 439.60 B: so she is female right 

439.34 454.16 A: um you know they said she was female when we bought her and her name is we called her lulu and then they told us a few weeks later that they weren't sure and i was very disappointed because if she's a male with a name like lulu so i 

442.13 442.87 B: [laughter] 

444.22 445.08 B: (( uh-huh )) 

447.91 448.92 B: okay 

453.16 456.06 B: [laughter] she's going to have a psychological problem 

455.09 460.64 A: yeah there you go so i didn't you know the only way to tell if they're male or female is to have them blood tested 

460.73 465.21 A: so um so ah you know i don't want to do it 

464.81 467.59 B: mhm how long how long have you had her 

465.25 466.48 A: i'm holding back 

468.00 470.66 A: um now for about two and a half years 

470.20 471.57 B: (( okay about two and a half )) 

470.70 476.94 A: yeah the first six weeks that i knew her she was still being hand fed and i used to go visit her at the bird store 

477.08 484.63 A: you know they use a syringe and they put the food right into their crop which is the area before it hits the stomach 

481.20 484.44 B: hm 

484.79 490.33 A: so they're really interesting pets and i think you might enjoy having one even with your five year old daughter oh 

490.14 495.90 B: (( okay mm [mn] oh i've got to see something hopefully i had time i'm on in the internet i was going to try to pull up a picture of one )) 

496.22 497.67 A: (( well let )) 

497.73 502.16 A: me tell you i got a i don't know what's going to happen at the end will it just cut off 

501.73 505.04 B: yeah well it's going to beep and then they give you thirty seconds uh-huh 

504.50 512.12 A: oh okay well um when i was much younger i used to have parakeets all the time and um 

512.16 519.80 A: i loved them i mean it's very good to teach responsibility to a child it's and it's an easier pet to have than a dog for sure 

518.33 521.65 B: (( mm )) 

520.07 529.42 A: you know so maybe if your daughter ever expresses an interest in getting something besides a goldfish or a guinea pig which are probably the other two easiest ways to go 

525.14 525.99 B: (( [mn] all right yeah )) 

530.05 530.90 A: (( you know )) 

530.28 539.27 B: what what in what since you've had lulu in two years would you think was the most astonishing thing that they that she does that you had no idea that she would do 

539.48 540.41 B: or that 

539.61 541.63 A: oh wow well 

541.78 548.33 A: that's an a fantastic question i think the most astonishing was is her level of acrobatics 

547.74 549.05 B: (( oh really )) 

548.49 562.97 A: yeah she has incredible balance and control so you can put like a tight wire and she could go to sleep on that and lift up her one foot and still be comfortable you know it's amazing i mean we wouldn't balance on that for for two seconds 

556.51 558.05 B: [laughter] 

558.23 559.13 B: (( oh )) 

561.46 562.58 B: [laughter] 

562.99 568.11 A: and so she loves to flip and hang upside down and she's just very acrobatic like 

567.95 579.52 A: if you give her a wire she'll slide up and down if she you know like build up a speed slide down the wire you know yeah so i guess that'll be it so it's character as much character as that 

572.71 573.53 B: [laughter] 

574.30 575.54 B: (( really mm )) 

579.96 585.14 A: now i'm looking at the the time on my my phone and it's actually almost eleven minutes 

586.39 587.29 A: and 

586.61 589.93 B: oh ah it's it's usually i guess it's going to beep 

590.07 591.65 B: in a second here 

591.58 595.11 A: so how many phone these phone calls are you doing a week 

594.57 598.50 B: ah i just did this as a like i'm just new to this 

598.12 599.89 A: well you know you're excellent you could be
