45.90 57.00 B: oh okay that's good well what i recommend if you're gonna get a dog is to do a lot of research and make sure you get a breed that's gonna be that's gonna suit your lifestyle 

46.46 47.47 A: yeah 

56.70 57.93 A: yeah 

57.32 68.45 B: um my cousin for instance got a jack russell terrier and it tore her house apart because she didn't give it they have a lot of energy like border collies have a lot of energy 

62.79 63.91 A: wow 

67.61 68.64 A: okay 

68.36 74.79 B: uh a lot of the hunting dogs weimaraners things like that you have to walk 'em a lot i have a german shepherd 

74.31 75.37 A: okay 

74.96 83.92 B: and what's nice about them is that if you wanna be busy and walk all the time they'll go with you but if you don't and you wanna be a couch potato they'll do that too [laughter] 

82.98 84.57 A: oh they go with the flow 

84.20 92.42 B: yeah they do whatever you wanna 'em [laughter] to so they're really labradors are that way any dog that would make a good like a seeing eye dog 

85.54 87.07 A: that's cool 

92.14 93.83 A: oh yeah something helpful 

93.50 103.08 B: anything you see as a seeing eye dog uh a golden retriever a labrador a german shepherd all those dogs are good because they can be active if you want 'em to be but they cannot be 

97.04 98.76 A: yeah the labradors 

103.20 105.65 B: active if you need 'em to calm down 

105.74 113.21 A: do you need space 'cause um i i always think when i think i think of dogs that you need like a lot of um you know backyard things like that 

111.97 120.62 B: well that's another thing with my dog he's a big german shepherd too um he weighs about a hundred and fifteen pounds a hundred and twenty pounds 

116.54 117.59 A: okay 

119.98 121.20 A: yeah 

120.56 132.36 B: but again he it you know i can walk him and he's fine we're in a small two bedroomed house and the yard's pretty small but he's fine he runs in and out the door a lot [laughter] 

128.03 129.06 A: okay 

131.47 136.26 A: and that and that's where the the walking comes in when you take them for the walks that's where they get their 

136.30 138.06 A: fresh air and you know 

136.50 137.35 B: right 

137.68 140.20 B: and we're lucky we have a field nearby 

139.76 142.07 A: okay so he gets to run around and 

140.28 141.24 B: so 

141.43 146.12 B: right i take him on a leash to the field and then i let him off the leash so he can run some 

146.29 151.40 B: and but he's really good if doesn't walk or a week or so he still doesn't he's fine 

149.63 150.68 A: yeah 

151.48 162.15 B: he um he's a little on the heavy side he needs to walk a little more than he does we spend a lot of time together but not a lot of time walking [laughter] well that's probably me feeding him [laughter] 

154.30 156.55 A: really [laughter] 

157.66 158.76 A: yeah 

159.27 160.95 A: wow so that's a just 

161.40 169.00 A: yeah d- you know that's another thing i'm like i don't know if i can afford to care for you know they're they're just as expensive as having like a child or something 

168.66 170.24 B: they're expensive 

169.47 173.51 A: you know with the feeding the the vets and you know uh 

171.78 172.67 B: (( yes )) 

172.73 176.58 B: cats too though we have a cat and um 

175.34 179.12 A: oh you oh do they get along like the cat and the dog 

178.51 187.62 B: yes my dog if he's outside and he sees a cat he wants to eat it but if we bring a cat into house and he knows it lives here he immediately accepts it 

182.35 183.73 A: (( yeah oh )) 

185.75 188.99 A: that's a different story it's a respect okay 

188.43 190.28 B: yes he's very good about 

190.12 204.65 B: he knows when he's supposed to be nice to something and he's bad about when we're out walking he doesn't like any other animals but he minds i mean if i tell him stop it if he's trying to go for something he'll stop it or whine a lot like let me kill it [laughter] 

196.54 197.51 A: yeah 

203.37 204.42 A: wow 

204.59 208.98 B: [laughter] but if i tell him to knock it off he's usually pretty good about it 

205.00 205.85 A: [laughter] 

208.98 222.97 B: the cats turned out to be we had two cats and um i have a twelve year old daughter and she had two cats and the younger one got hit by a car um right after christmas 

209.15 209.82 A: (( mm ))

224.36 231.04 A: you get used to them you know you get used to pets and you know living with them every day it it' such a comfort you know 

230.67 244.45 B: yes it was really hard we cried a lot and then we went and got another kitten to try to our cat i could tell was lonely too 'cause she was really used to this other cat so we got another kitten those were males we got a female this time 

240.30 241.33 A: yeah 

244.48 257.98 B: and they had just really got acquainted and started getting along when my other cat got sick my other male cat got sick and i thought we quit letting him out too because we didn't want him to get hit by a car so our cats became indoor cats 

257.45 259.19 A: oh really domestic 

258.56 266.97 B: and he got sick and they said they think it was pneumonia we had to have him put to sleep he just like died before our eyes he was getting really really bad

270.71 274.93 A: yeah that's what i mean they they could really um you know takes an investment 

273.11 279.02 B: yeah cats too so it's not just dogs i mean dogs cost more to feed of course 

278.77 282.97 A: you know if if i can get over that allergy i would get some cats 

279.28 280.01 B: but 

282.37 287.77 B: we both have allergies and we just put up with it anyway yeah we we take pills for it

444.26 446.02 A: they look like little mouse 

446.68 455.02 B: um yeah i don't know if they bite or not because it's really strange that mice and rats are a lot alike except for mice will bite you and i've never had a rat bite me ever 

454.36 457.40 A: wow that is scary oh i ooh but 

456.56 465.23 B: [noise] and hamsters can be nasty and they also are great escape artists god they can get out of [laughter] any

474.94 487.79 A: you know it it's the way is set up because y- you know the house isn't really like that crowded so you know there wasn't that many and we used to always search and once once it escaped though yeah we always found it 

487.18 491.94 B: uh-huh mm [noise] well that's good well another good pet [noise] would be a snake 

488.02 488.86 A: (( but um )) 

489.25 490.48 A: so you know the 

492.29 497.16 A: i like that no i trust me i do you know the the little skinny ones

503.05 505.93 A: oh so they have snakes and stuff like that 

504.68 510.22 B: and i grew up um in huntington beach and we had field right behind our house 

509.59 510.69 A: okay 

510.17 523.69 B: so i would catch snakes and we ca- we had a lot of pets growing up we had dogs and cats and snake and like you're saying hamsters and rats and chickens and rabbits [laughter] 

519.08 520.92 A: the turtles everything 

521.29 526.47 A: oh yeah the rab- yeah they're st- yeah they're fun they're very fun 

525.78 530.80 B: but i was the first snake i ever got i found a a um garden snake 

530.85 537.52 B: uh guess it was a i like it was a kin- a california king snake and i thought it was a belt laying on the sidewalk 

537.29 538.21 A: wow 

537.60 545.63 B: and i went to see what it was and it was a snake and i caught it i wasn't afraid the first time i saw one i just like yes [laughter] and i picked it up 

544.39 544.95 A: (( [mn] )) 

545.21 547.82 A: you didn't think it was poisonous or anything 

547.36 553.07 B: i didn't even think about it i was probably about seven or something and i was just excited to find it 

548.28 549.80 A: you didn't think about it 

550.30 551.90 A: oh it was just fun 

552.60 554.14 A: yeah 

553.49 561.96 B: and over the years we had florida kings and burmese pythons and rainbow boas and i don't have any now but 

561.37 568.72 A: are they loyal like i don't know anything about snakes is like like like do they get used to you or do would they escape if they get a chance 

568.88 570.97 B: [lipsmack] well um 

571.38 577.24 B: i think they would probably escape if they had a chance but a lot of dogs would do that [laughter] 

573.57 574.71 A: (( oh okay )) 

575.34 582.37 A: okay 'cause i know dogs i'm thinking dogs are loyal they get used to the the person they're with and cats too they'll come back 

578.51 579.21 B: (( too )) 

582.09 592.90 B: [mn] but snakes can be really friendly um i was again if you're gonna get a snake i would like you're saying get a smaller one that's not gonna get too big burmese pythons are really sweet but they get huge 

589.39 590.61 A: (( yeah )) 

592.11 594.56 A: they get oh yeah they they're from burma 

592.96 599.95 B: i ended up yeah i was actually raising rats to feed the snake because it was getting so expensive 

596.69 598.26 A: just to feed the snake 

599.47 599.95 A: ye-
