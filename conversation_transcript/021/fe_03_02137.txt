111.47 124.58 B: and cook um [noise] you know maybe several times a week [sigh] but if you have small children and a [noise] husband and then you have to cook [sigh] three times a day that's overkill [noise] you know [noise] right 

115.18 116.11 A: mhm 

123.98 132.85 A: yeah that is a lot of cooking i know what you mean 'cause i did it for my three kids and [sigh] i'm telling you i'm glad they got to teenagers [laughter]

149.45 151.43 A: (( yep that's good enough )) 

151.19 158.60 B: know [sigh] [sigh] and i would go um i didn't have a car for a while so i would walk over to the farmers' market and i would buy fresh 

158.73 163.38 B: fresh vegetables and fresh fruit and i would carry them home on the bus 

163.25 164.13 A: uh-huh

179.80 181.50 B: mm i know 

185.50 188.26 B: yeah that's the trouble with going out 

187.78 189.09 A: uh-huh

193.59 195.15 A: [sigh] um 

195.26 197.29 A: (( let me see i ))

206.07 207.25 A: yep 

206.66 213.76 B: i like fish [noise] but [sigh] you know i only know how to fry it i don't [laughter] and then it's not so healthy for you [laughter] you 

211.21 212.36 A: [laughter] 

213.49 222.51 A: i used to make a mess of it when i first stated making it it's like oh my god this ain't coming out right it would be half done inside and i mean i wanted to give up [sigh] 

220.43 221.75 B: (( know )) 

221.95 232.37 B: ooh yeah [sigh] i put like half oil and half butter in the pan and then the oil doesn't burn you know and the butter gives it that good flavor 

226.91 227.84 A: uh-huh 

232.07 233.03 A: (( yeah )) 

232.46 236.86 B: olive oil doesn't burn as easily as butter burns you know [laughter] so [sigh] 

235.75 241.66 A: yeah that makes sense i do that sometimes too i mix the um oil and the butter yeah 

239.50 249.98 B: oil and the butter yeah and then just cook it you know a few minutes and then turn it over and cook it you know and then when you stick the fork it sort of flakes 

247.02 248.01 A: yeah 

249.76 263.50 A: yeah it takes time but when you're cooking that it's like you know you can't like turn it up real hot or rush through it [sigh] like with chicken you can try and cook it a little higher but i learned there was the difference between cooking fish and chicken [laughter]
