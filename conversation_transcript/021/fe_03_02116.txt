52.69 53.77 B: mhm 

58.76 67.35 A: um where i'm originally from is germany the whole the whole um concept of friendship is quite different 

67.01 68.73 B: oh really in what way 

67.37 68.17 A: (( um )) 

68.31 75.82 A: in in a way that here very people say very quickly my friend so and so okay 

75.00 75.96 B: mhm 

75.71 84.99 A: um which does not really necessarily mean like a friend so i guess the def- definition of friendship is a little different um 

83.60 84.68 B: mhm 

84.88 91.31 A: knowing someone sometimes i meet i people tell me about friends but they don't know their last names 

91.03 92.01 B: mhm 

91.70 93.25 A: okay so 

93.88 99.75 A: i i for my that's why i'm saying i i very clearly distinguish between friendship 

99.83 110.13 A: and acquaintances so friends being people i share intimate secrets with people that know me fr- you know 

101.53 102.45 B: mhm 

110.09 115.19 A: a a relationship that has built over years and years people who i can 

115.35 116.64 A: um 

116.86 120.13 A: really really rely on um 

120.67 125.74 A: so this is what i would uh consider like close fr- close friends 

125.21 130.77 B: i agree with you that's what i consider close friends are i think everybody has friends then there's certain friends that you 

129.21 131.04 A: (( right )) 

130.83 134.53 B: you will be friends all your lives that's what i try to tell my children that 

134.55 146.17 B: certain friends they'll be your friends from now till till you die you you'll stay close to 'em all your life and then you'll meet new friends new people'll come in to your life that will be good friends but those old friends just kinda hang on with you 

146.19 152.65 A: yeah i've what what's interesting though is that sometimes you meet friends from long gone days 

152.39 153.44 B: mhm 

152.86 159.19 A: and uh it seems like within like it takes about ten minutes and it's the same like it was years and years ago 

159.05 169.75 B: yeah i have a friend that that i went to high school with and we still stay real close we don't see each other that often but she knows i'm here for her and i know she's there for me and if i need her she'll be there for me 

169.67 175.25 A: this this this is this is exactly that's that's exactly what i'm saying yeah 

170.26 171.01 B: we'll 

173.35 184.23 B: mm but i've met another friend that i haven't known but just a few years from here and i could call on her any time i needed her and we've developed a fr- a real close friendship over just the last three or four years so 

183.75 185.56 A: mhm 

184.19 188.37 B: you know new people can come in your life and they can you can develop good friendships with 'em 

188.04 190.06 A: mhm mhm 

189.97 196.96 A: yeah i i mean you know i guess sometimes once you have a family you get married and so forth you know the 

196.86 208.21 A: like relationships change a little bit and sometimes even or people change their lifestyles people who you were close with maybe at college and you shared 

208.47 216.95 A: let's say an apartment because you both both of you didn't have much money and uh you know th- ten years later one is making 

216.88 227.02 A: uh five hundred thousand a year and here i am with uh fifty or sixty or seventy and uh sort of the lifestyle has 

226.98 234.84 A: changed on both sides a little bit and sometimes friendship i just interesting enough i just spoke to a close friend of mine 

235.31 241.34 A: sometimes friendships um grow apart just like relationships i guess 

240.56 254.22 B: they do they do and i don't think the you know nothing has to happen it's like you said you you get busy in day to day living and you go your separate ways and nothing has to happen to make that happen it's just just a matter of life 

253.40 260.03 A: sometimes it's hard to let go i mean you hang on to you you went through certain phases of 

260.07 269.73 A: your lives together and there was a lot of trust a lot of common ground and all of a sudden you see someone who is just you know there's like this 

269.95 283.98 A: this this this change of let's say maybe life philosophy someone who was very liberal becomes uh very conservative or the other way round and uh you know one has very 

284.43 291.49 A: i you know how difficult it is deal with this and sometimes i guess it's just better to let it go um 

290.77 292.82 B: yeah you're right 

292.08 300.43 A: this is this is this is i mean that's that's that's the tough part and i guess um the harder it is to let that happen 

301.16 304.47 A: i guess the deeper the friendship was in a way 

303.37 311.09 B: yeah my very best friend that i had had all my life passed away about three or four years ago and i have missed her so bad 

310.99 319.11 B: and and picked up the phone to call her she was my very very best friend and there's been other friends that come in my life but that special special friend 

319.25 323.52 B: just had a way with me she knew me inside out and i still miss her today 

323.81 324.63 A: mm 

324.33 329.17 B: but you know life had to go on for her for me and for her family after she left us 

328.91 332.39 A: does she does she does she miss you as well 

329.36 330.63 B: and it was hard 

332.26 337.44 B: i think she does i think she's watching over me i think she's an angel watching over me i think she misses me too 

337.00 341.06 A: oh she oh you you uh she oh 

338.82 340.14 B: she passed away 

340.74 342.79 B: (( you know she had an aneurism and passed away )) 

341.78 347.27 A: well that that that can be just as tough i guess as a family member oh 

346.43 359.22 B: i i think it was i think it was she talking about friends she had a picture in her living room that was two two little ladies walking up on the front porch and she always said that was me and her growing old together walking 

359.24 371.86 B: and you know the picture was us represented us and a couple of christmases ago her husband brought me that picture and gave it to me for a christmas present and i just recently moved and the first thing i took with me was that picture that's how much it meant to me 

372.00 374.65 B: so he knew how close our friendship was 

375.10 376.44 A: i i i 

375.63 383.39 B: and i but you know like i said i have developed new ones but nothing as as close as that friendship but i have developed new ones and have friends that i deeply care about 

383.62 398.50 A: that but that you know sometimes that that that's that's hard especially when you when when something not necessarily like that but when a few disappointments with people you thought you could trust when that didn't work out it's very i mean you become very 

398.80 403.40 A: um one becomes very careful to choose 

403.43 416.14 A: uh you to to i mean to let anything out in in a way because friendships is foremost about trust and uh trust is something that has become very difficult over time 

415.23 421.74 B: [sigh] that's right you know if if there's a true if they're a true friend you could tell 'em anything but you know like you were just talking about some of those acquaint 

421.76 432.62 B: acquaintances i just wouldn't tell them anything but those that true friend i would tell them something and know that they were trust [mn] trust them with what i had told them too or if i needed help i could call on them and they would be here to help me 

432.31 433.53 A: yeah 

432.89 445.05 B: specially living from a a small town and there's you know like i said i have so many friends but there's a few group of just of special friends well i guess you've made a lot of new friends when coming from from germany 

440.52 441.62 A: yeah 

445.01 448.00 B: you left a lot of friends how long have you been in united states

466.51 475.43 A: but after all these years what it really came down to is like a handful of five people handful of people that is
