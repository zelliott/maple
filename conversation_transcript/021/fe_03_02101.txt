10.52 12.41 A: yes i think so [mn] 

11.61 15.33 B: (( oh okay um so i guess we're tal- we're supposed to talk about friends friendships )) 

12.50 13.17 A: [noise] 

14.70 16.23 A: (( yes yes )) 

15.94 17.63 B: okay um 

18.89 27.00 B: gee it's uh well [laughter] i recently i recently got married and before that i had a lot of friends and it just seemed like 

19.94 22.28 A: [laughter] well [noise] 

26.98 34.57 B: when when i moved away it i just tended to lose a lot of my friends and as as i got older i just found out that 

34.85 49.28 B: i mean true friendship is very hard to fi- find i lost a friendship i've had for tw- for for years over something that happened and i mean right now i i can say i have very few friends but the friends that i do have are true friends 

42.00 42.66 A: [noise] 

49.19 52.47 A: (( [noise] right )) 

49.84 54.93 B: and that that's what i've learned about friendships is they're very hard to find 

54.53 66.07 A: [noise] yeah when we're younger we think we everybody's our friend you you know high school and college yeah name your friends and i could name them on you know 

58.28 59.61 B: mhm 

65.97 67.08 B: right 

66.38 77.93 A: both hands and both feet you know i had friends galore and as years go along you get away from those and you know you still retain a few sometimes 

68.96 69.68 B: (( mm )) 

70.42 72.27 B: yeah that's what you 

73.99 75.26 B: mhm 

76.41 77.31 B: (( [noise] )) 

77.26 83.36 B: yeah it's just that i find that a lot of people just don't tend to keep in touch i find that i'm the only one that's constantly 

83.24 95.73 B: emailing or calling and i i just don't don't get the same response and then when i confront them they're just life is busy i'm sorry life is busy for me too but it takes two seconds to pick up a phone call and say hello 

87.95 89.66 A: (( right [noise] )) 

95.70 96.72 A: (( yes )) 

96.06 103.13 B: and it just i mean i just realized who who my couple of friends are that stick by me but 

102.98 115.99 B: otherwise i i think i find that as a big challenge i look at my fr- my parents and they've had friends for over thirty years and they came from a different country and and the people that they've met thirty years ago they're still friends with 

115.55 117.03 A: (( [noise] right )) 

116.07 125.22 B: and i i look at myself and that one friend that i had for twenty something years and our friendship ended two years ago over something really little 

125.15 130.82 B: and i the other friends that i have are all the people i've made in the last five years and 

130.71 133.99 B: i i i i just i just don't understand wh- why 

133.81 136.82 B: and it's also a matter of trusting i just find that 

136.58 150.29 B: a lot of it's competitiveness and jealousy that comes among friends and i just don't believe that that should happen if if you're a friend and that's what i tend to find you know when i got married you know my husband and i we bought this nice home and 

137.77 138.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

140.63 141.85 A: (( right )) 

150.07 158.01 B: everyone our they're they're constantly asking do you have do you have this or that or they just want to come now to visit us just to look at our home 

158.02 165.29 B: and if if they're friends i i mean i moved out of the i used to live in two years and no one has ever made a visit 

165.25 166.70 A: (( yeah )) 

165.39 169.13 B: if they were true friends they would have came you know a while back so 

168.92 180.60 B: that that's the biggest challenge i find as far as friendship i just don't i i think they're very very hard to find and if you if i now if i do meet people i'm always very hesitant to open up because of my experience 

180.17 186.66 A: right yeah we found out about friends uh our house burned down in august 

185.88 187.07 B: mhm 

187.06 191.12 A: and we had no insurance and we had no you know 

191.37 192.66 A: no nothing 

192.89 194.19 A: (( and uh )) 

195.10 199.56 A: we i was surprised at the number of people that said 

199.79 200.93 A: okay 

200.80 201.91 B: mhm 

201.74 204.03 A: here here you know we had some 

204.14 209.35 A: some neighbors that we didn't really even think of as close friends that said 

208.15 209.19 B: mhm 

209.78 215.48 A: no you're not going any- you're staying here at our place for a couple of days at least until 

215.84 217.86 A: we figure out what's going on 

217.11 218.20 B: right 

218.17 220.72 A: you know and they they have 

220.01 223.13 B: out of out of how many fr- like how many friends 

223.52 227.70 B: o- offered that or were you shocked at the ones that didn't offer 

226.68 239.10 A: in in all reality i was kind of shocked at the number that did that that you know afterwards said hey our house is open while you're figuring out if you want to stay here awhile and that 

230.99 232.03 B: mhm 

237.04 240.49 B: but do you think do you think they really meant that or was 

239.74 243.61 A: yeah i mean some of them did 

240.92 245.73 B: because there's a big difference and lot of people will say i will help you but when it comes down to it 

245.85 248.16 B: they're nowhere to be found so 

247.40 252.32 A: well it it did cut up because we had the first weekend after it 

252.27 262.50 A: we had probably twenty something folks show up to help us clean up the house you know to clear out stuff that was burned out because it was really hard for us to do it we lost 

256.64 257.73 B: mhm 

262.76 263.95 B: right 

262.93 266.70 A: you know we lost everything we lost a bunch of animals 

266.27 267.39 B: mhm 

267.06 278.05 A: uh it was uh real hard uh barbara couldn't even go down there you know it was just so so much for her but here i somebody had to go down there 'cause i had these people coming down to help 

271.96 272.97 B: yeah 

277.70 278.78 B: mhm 

278.47 288.48 A: but they didn't stick it out [laughter] you know they were there one time and then i had about a dozen there the next weekend and then i had 

280.88 281.82 B: (( [laughter] )) 

283.14 283.75 B: (( mm )) 

286.46 287.76 B: mhm 

288.97 290.60 A: one person came 

290.63 295.38 A: or like two people came next and then one person came like three more times 

294.93 296.25 B: (( oh okay )) 

295.70 300.54 A: you know so it was kind of quick to see you know it kinda dwindled 

299.84 300.94 B: yeah 

300.76 305.15 A: and uh but [sigh] you know it it was 

305.36 311.64 A: most of the people that came to begin with were acquaintances that just they wanted to help people but 

310.65 314.70 B: what about the people that you expected did they come through 

314.46 325.51 A: [sigh] so- a few of 'em did but not near what i would have liked not what i would have ex- what not near what i would have done for them you know 

315.70 316.70 B: or not 

316.80 317.98 B: like your long 

318.24 319.52 B: oh okay 

320.99 321.62 B: (( mm )) 

322.77 324.09 B: you realize 

324.57 331.06 B: you realize like that was a test and now i'm pretty sure in your mind you know who will stick by you 

330.53 332.90 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

331.11 337.81 B: and um you know that pretty much happened to me is at any situation in your life you will know who sticks by you and 

337.39 338.54 A: right 

337.82 346.41 B: um i just find that as we ge- as i got older it was more so the competitive issue and a big jealousy and envious issue 

346.28 347.79 A: yeah 

346.70 360.50 B: and and that that's what causes problems and i i i was always brought up whether it's family or friends you should you should just be happy with what you have and you shouldn't let jealousy get in the way of friends and that that's just what seems to be happening a lot with a lot of my friends 

360.30 368.49 A: right yeah i i've got a few friends that that they go when i've got it it's theirs and when they've got it it's mine you 

366.02 367.04 B: mhm 

367.98 369.10 B: yeah 

368.65 371.30 A: know but for the most part 

371.90 376.92 A: when you've got it they they're they're fine to be your friends but when you don't have anything 

376.45 377.62 B: mhm 

377.44 379.11 A: you know it's like 

379.21 383.02 A: well you know i'll see you around you know 

381.81 383.39 B: right yeah 

383.83 392.00 A: so uh i this this indeed has shown us what friend you know what friends will do and what they won't do you know 

390.24 392.21 B: mhm yeah 

392.91 395.95 A: so i i don't know i'm 

397.02 404.57 A: i'm [laughter] we had some we had some friends that since this happened they were 

398.27 399.06 B: (( [laughter] )) 

405.05 408.55 A: our cl- i mean every saturday night we went to their house 

407.99 409.15 B: right 

408.76 421.84 A: you know it was just we went out there and we did stuff together if they wanted to go off we stayed and took care of their kids and uh we did you know all kinds of things together 

421.30 422.45 B: mhm 

422.06 423.11 A: uh 

423.16 425.29 B: so what caused the change 

424.67 429.82 A: well we had a a friend of ours was was moving away 

429.58 430.70 B: mhm 

430.41 443.21 A: and she had said when i leave i'm not taking any of my furniture and y'all need it 'cause you're going to be getting a new place eventually so the furniture in the house all the furniture's yours i just have to sell the house 

436.98 438.08 B: mhm 

442.81 444.08 B: oh okay 

444.15 447.71 A: and our friends were looking for 

447.91 450.51 A: a place to move to 

450.38 451.55 B: mhm 

450.73 453.22 A: but they would never qualify for 

453.35 456.09 A: getting a loan on this nice little place 

455.61 456.80 B: yeah 

456.21 458.35 A: in a very nice neighborhood 

458.61 459.59 A: you know

463.74 464.87 B: mhm 

465.23 471.32 A: and so we turned to the girl who was you know a a that had offered us the furniture and we said hey they're 

471.41 482.02 A: looking for a place to rent they're friends of yours would you be interested in renting to them and she was like you know i hadn't thought about it but yeah that sounds like a good idea 

475.92 476.98 B: yeah 

481.65 482.97 B: mhm 

482.38 485.12 A: so they went through and they did it and we were gonna 

485.17 488.25 A: she had to move a month earlier 

488.24 489.45 B: oh okay 

488.72 497.95 A: than she'd planned on and so it was like they had to move right in and we said well we'll rent a truck we'll split the price on the truck we'll 

498.29 507.17 A: take your stuff over and as we load your stuff in we'll load our stuff which is all the furniture that was in the house out on to the truck 

506.73 507.85 B: mhm 

508.41 520.20 A: and we got over there to to load the stuff in she said why don't we just put our our stuff in the garage and we'll get the stuff later and then it came around where they ended up keeping all the furniture too 

519.98 520.97 B: oh 

521.10 528.62 A: and so yeah that kind of put a real damp they got greedy as friends they got greedy
