362.17 369.72 B: put some water in it and put the lid on it and go off and leave it for a wh- for a while you don't do that with stir fry i bet do you uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh 

368.38 376.55 A: no 'cause see stir fr- the secret to stir fry is you keep in most of the nutrients in the in the veg- vegetables you try to use fresh vegetables 

376.69 386.47 A: and you um you cook them fast you know you heat your pan up you put the oil in and you put the you put you put all the vegetables in and you like you keep moving them around 

386.19 388.29 B: no water to melt anything 

387.58 399.87 A: no not no water unless you use froz- you can use frozen too so with frozen you need a tiny bit of water to thaw it out but once it thaws out you still cook it fast and you might have a like a you know like a cup of rice on the side 

390.99 393.61 B: yeah and then might melt off a little uh-huh 

399.31 400.36 B: yeah 

399.70 408.03 A: and and the secret to stir fry to make it taste nasty uh t- tasty to make it taste tasty is a nice sauce like a low fat sauce 

407.96 415.72 A: there are you know you can go to the library and get recipes for low fat sauces and just you know when you're cooking the sauce just um 

416.62 424.62 A: when you're cooking a stir fry just a- a- add add it in when it's almost done you put your sauce in so because you don't want your vegetables to get limp 

424.64 431.00 A: you know you just want them to be still fresh and crunchy so you put the put the you should do that cause you'll lose a lot of weight
