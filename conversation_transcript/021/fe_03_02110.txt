0.06 2.07 A: hi my name is anne 

1.67 3.48 B: hi i'm paul 

3.51 4.76 A: (( [laughter] nice to meet you )) 

4.39 6.37 B: you too how are you today 

5.63 7.58 A: (( [laughter] i'm okay how're you doing )) 

7.16 9.43 B: i'm not too bad 

8.21 9.55 A: that's good 

9.78 13.89 B: so i guess we're supposed to talk about friends this is kinda my first time doing this 

13.28 15.66 A: oh it is okay this is my second so 

14.99 17.31 B: oh okay well you're the old veteran then 

16.72 19.68 A: i guess so [laughter] [laughter] 

17.66 18.93 B: (( outstanding )) 

20.06 22.13 B: well so tell me about your friends 

21.57 30.05 A: okay well i would definitely say that i'm the type of person who has a few close friends rather than many acquaintances i tend to be 

29.86 36.72 A: slightly hesitant about making friends and you know i always make sure that it's somebody i'm really going to be a good friend with before 

37.13 38.15 A: um 

38.54 42.02 A: you know i start to associate with them generally anyway so 

44.44 45.46 A: (( how about you )) 

45.57 52.18 B: okay well i'm kinda the same way but i've got a fairly outgoing personality and so 

52.20 53.96 B: i do tend to 

54.24 63.87 B: to make acquaintances easily and then within that i have um oh a small handful of people that i'm really close to 

63.38 65.07 A: right okay 

65.10 66.34 B: but uh 

66.67 70.26 A: yeah no i'm definitely not that outgoing person who'll just you know 

70.93 73.95 A: just start talking to people [laughter] that's not me at all 

73.53 74.36 B: (( no )) 

74.87 81.30 B: ye- i you know i haven't always been but it's one of those things that i kinda decided that i wanted in my life and so i developed that 

80.74 84.00 A: oh really that's really impressive actually because 

83.29 84.44 B: oh thank you 

84.14 87.67 A: yeah that's something i wish i could do so maybe i'll 

87.62 88.44 B: well 

87.85 89.78 A: start giving it a try [laughter] 

89.27 93.85 B: it it's amazing to me it's intensely gratifying that uh 

93.78 103.29 B: i've noticed that as i walk down the street if i just greet somebody with a friendly smile maybe a nod of the head they get a look on their face that's 

103.10 109.24 B: well not only surprised but sometimes relieved because i think sometimes people just expect rejection 

109.06 111.54 A: that's actually yeah that's a good point 

111.48 112.85 A: i found well 

112.66 126.62 A: so i've lived now on the east coast and i currently live in california and i found that it is true that people are way more laid-back out west and that you know you can you can just walk down the street and have people smile at you and it is something to 

126.42 131.15 A: take note of if you if you're not used to it so it is yeah it is surprising 

130.94 134.79 B: i think it depends a little bit though on where in california you are 

134.47 137.53 A: okay that's true so i'm from san diego 

137.60 145.95 B: oh okay see now i'm from indiana and i live in indiana now but i did spend five and a half years in california 

141.14 142.03 A: mhm 

145.40 146.41 A: mhm 

146.38 150.57 B: and part of that time i was you know driving a school bus in east l. a. 

150.22 151.48 A: oh okay 

151.38 157.65 B: and i discovered that there people are less likely to be friendly in that area 

152.32 153.35 A: that's true 

154.61 155.67 A: (( right )) 

156.97 158.32 A: yeah okay 

159.40 165.59 B: but as far as friends go i've had one best friend for twenty two years and 

164.60 165.89 A: oh okay wow 

165.67 166.78 B: um 

167.65 173.54 B: oh and then other people in my life that i've been close to for a time and then oh 

174.49 179.71 B: uh maybe we drift geographically or just kinda lose touch 

179.32 180.32 A: yeah 

180.92 183.23 A: yeah i don't know i've 

183.33 186.90 A: i'm a junior in college right now and i still 

185.79 187.80 B: yeah you sound young 

187.25 191.94 A: [laughter] um i had actually kind of an unusual 

191.88 195.55 A: group of friends in high school there were ten of us total and we just 

195.39 207.56 A: all got along so well and it's a fairly large group to call each one of them my best friends but it's completely true they were all my best friends and we've kept in touch ever since graduation and it's 

207.66 210.87 A: still the same i still consider them my best friends so 

210.30 214.32 B: yeah i'm picturing phoebe rachel monica the whole bunch here 

212.63 218.36 A: [laughter] no not quite [laughter] little bit different but uh 

218.98 220.48 A: (( yeah so )) 

220.50 224.87 B: were they all all um young ladies or okay 

222.82 224.42 A: all girls yeah 

224.47 234.31 A: yeah the ten of us we somehow we got named the squad it's not a name that we ever came up with ourselves [laughter] but i guess other people noticed you know how how tight we were so 

234.93 236.80 A: it was interesting yeah 

235.08 236.14 B: okay 

236.44 238.19 B: well that's kind of cool 

237.62 238.56 A: yep 

239.20 245.94 B: but uh it'll be interesting over the next oh number of years to see just exactly 

239.34 240.52 A: (( so )) 

245.35 246.94 A: (( how close we stay )) 

246.24 249.09 B: yeah how close you stay because i had a 

248.15 249.44 A: yeah 

249.24 254.02 B: oh i had a little group of friends like that in high school and and 

254.77 257.28 B: uh we all kind of went our separate ways 

257.13 271.69 A: yeah i've always found that pretty sad actually that you know my parents will talk about their friends from college a lot and obviously their friends since college but i almost never heard anything about friends in high school so when i was in high school with this fabulous group of girls 

271.57 273.82 A: it just really scared me that i you know 

274.04 279.35 A: i might not keep in touch with them as well as i planned to so we've we've all made a really good effort i think 

279.02 283.25 B: [sigh] well that's cool and i think the internet has changed things too that way 

280.44 281.34 A: yeah 

281.88 283.93 A: oh yeah definitely 

285.15 294.48 B: but um yeah i know that that well thanks to the internet i've recently gotten back in touch with an old friend from high school 

294.09 295.17 A: oh okay 

295.00 299.29 B: and discovered that we are still old friends and it's great 

297.54 300.25 A: yeah mhm no that's cool 

300.92 302.33 B: of course that was 

303.09 306.27 B: [mn] oh we were friends in high school probably before you were born 

305.82 307.26 A: [laughter] 

308.52 309.51 B: so 

309.38 310.42 A: yeah 

311.47 314.95 B: it's uh uh it's interesting 

314.44 315.54 A: mhm 

315.45 319.47 B: but i've moved all over the country and lived in two other countries now so 

319.04 320.20 A: oh okay 

319.75 322.11 B: it's been a little bit hard to keep in touch oh 

321.59 336.09 A: yeah i know i actually grew up part of my life in england so um i had a couple of friends that i you know i kept in touch with probably about ten friends from england right as soon as we came back and also i was ten when we moved back so i mean 

325.68 327.19 B: very good 

335.98 336.86 B: yeah 

336.26 338.89 A: expectations are a little bit different but um 

337.96 338.75 B: sure 

339.29 343.86 A: and i still keep in touch with one of them it's dwindled down to one but um 

344.03 350.10 A: yeah i am still in contact with one of my friends my parents keep in really good touch with the people we know over there 

349.78 352.29 B: [noise] you do that mostly by internet 

352.00 355.43 A: um no actually that's all through regular mail 

355.11 356.07 B: (( oh okay )) 

355.86 356.98 A: yeah 

357.03 358.03 B: wow 

358.37 368.82 B: now that i respect because you know i can i can bang out an email and hit a button to send it but for me to write a letter find an envelope 

359.83 361.54 A: [laughter] yeah 

366.46 367.66 A: mhm 

368.21 371.82 A: yeah keep track of the address yeah [laughter] 

368.89 370.38 B: look up the address 

370.40 376.48 B: you know get a stamp and get it to the post office way too many steps for a 

375.12 378.59 A: [laughter] yeah 

377.26 378.83 B: for somebody like me 

378.75 380.03 A: yeah 

379.94 384.96 B: but uh so yeah i have tremendous respect for that that's awesome 

380.64 381.66 A: (( i don't know mhm )) 

385.87 389.22 A: it's not as good i don't know i enjoy receiving actual mail too 

390.65 393.66 B: (( oh i bet )) 

391.71 392.71 A: yeah 

395.91 396.82 B: so 

396.99 398.90 B: with your friends i mean 

398.94 400.87 B: what kind of uh 

400.93 408.43 B: what kind of activities is it a real active go do things bunch or is it a sitting round sit around and talk group 

407.83 418.99 A: but i don't know um definitely [laughter] um actually it's a little bit of both we had our share of sitting round and talking and actually one of the things that really distinguished us this is the group from high school 

418.94 425.18 A: we would get into the most crazy fights over trivial little things but and i don't know 

425.65 437.57 A: it we'd have these longstanding battles that it was you know didn't change our friendship at all just kind of a fun thing to do [laughter] to argue and you know cat fight or whatever but uh no we also had a lot of um 

431.49 432.90 B: [laughter] 

438.19 449.95 A: activities that we did fairly regularly one of them whenever it rained um we would go to this one field near our high school and play just mud sports you know mud football or mud soccer and 

449.36 450.66 B: oh that's awesome 

450.06 456.27 A: have a great time with that so yeah that was one of our things that we did whenever possible 

455.98 457.59 B: oh very cool 

457.32 458.38 A: yep 

458.85 464.22 A: so i don't know maybe it's the fact that i kept the same friends pretty much all throughout high school 

464.64 466.64 A: that you know 

466.83 469.72 A: makes me more likely to 

470.22 473.77 A: or less likely to just branch out and try and meet new people 

474.74 477.61 A: since i had such a steady group in high school i don't know 

477.48 483.18 B: i don't know though maybe it's because you're less likely to branch out and meet new people that you had such a steady group 

481.85 484.09 A: that i had a st- oh that's true [laughter] 

483.39 486.11 B: i don't know which is the cause which is the effect 

484.52 487.05 A: (( a lot of causality here [laughter] )) 

486.36 488.28 B: exactly 

488.22 490.27 A: mm that's interesting 

489.41 492.45 B: very interesting now that would be a uh 

492.41 495.88 A: yeah i should write my next paper on that [laughter] 

492.58 493.32 B: (( that )) 

495.15 496.62 B: yeah what's your major 

496.09 498.77 A: i'm actually a bi- uh a biology major 

499.46 502.38 B: yeah i don't know if there's a biology paper in that or not 

501.44 504.18 A: [laughter] oh that's right 

503.90 505.59 B: sociology maybe 

505.04 507.03 A: yeah definitely 

508.28 511.10 B: but uh yeah very interesting 

510.95 516.75 A: yeah it's convenient for me right now because my roommate is definitely the type of person who 

516.80 522.26 A: uh will meet you know ten people every night she goes out so as long as i stick with her 

522.63 527.95 A: [laughter] you know i'm likely to meet a couple of people once in a while but 

527.91 533.44 B: yeah that's kind of cool now do you consider yourself more of an introvert or more of an extrovert 

532.89 534.50 A: introvert definitely 

533.93 535.90 B: definitely yeah okay 

534.55 535.74 A: mhm 

535.98 537.93 B: [sigh] with all the uh 

538.21 543.85 B: all the uh personality characteristics that go along with that very detail oriented very 

543.28 545.63 A: oh yes definitely 

544.07 545.02 B: okay 

545.66 547.16 A: analytical 

547.07 548.00 B: okay 

548.14 555.02 B: well see now i don't know if that necessarily follows because i'm very much of an extrovert but i'm also very analytical 

554.46 555.54 A: oh really 

555.18 556.33 B: yeah 

555.82 556.51 A: hm 

557.70 559.91 A: for some reason i associated the two 

559.88 567.23 B: yeah i'm kind of a oh i don't know i don't think of myself this way but my friends and family all tell me i'm quite the philosopher 

566.98 569.24 A: oh okay [laughter] 

570.55 571.52 A: (( mm )) 

570.79 571.83 B: (( so but uh )) 

574.93 577.29 B: (( yeah uh )) 

578.14 585.13 B: you know and then i enjoy a couple of really close relationships and i you know i belong to a couple of groups that uh 

586.00 591.06 B: yeah we meet we're good friends and we go our separate ways until we meet again 

590.69 591.66 A: yeah 

592.71 595.20 B: and that's kinda neat you know clubs and that kind of thing but uh 

594.63 597.07 A: right yeah oh that's great
