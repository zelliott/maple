90.00 102.68 A: well i live in a retirement community yes i do and it's a very active community and we've been here for two years and have a big circle of friends 

92.02 93.71 B: oh do you really

102.47 104.97 B: i bet you do in something like that

106.00 106.66 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

107.43 107.99 B: (( [cough] )) 

110.09 115.10 A: none of them are as close as the friends that i left up north because 

115.40 122.87 A: of the time that we had friendships up there it was an extended period of time like thirty years 

122.62 123.78 B: yeah 

123.22 128.02 A: and so we've only been here for two years but i mean we 

128.34 134.56 A: have a very extensive social life and what we would call close friends down here but 

134.61 138.23 A: um uh still our friends are only two years old 

138.76 140.01 B: that's true not 

140.25 142.34 B: (( a long time )) 

141.92 143.00 A: pardon 

142.55 144.42 B: not a long time 

143.85 147.76 A: no no not to build deep deep relationships 

147.58 151.12 B: i call them deep relationships rather than friends 

151.31 158.05 A: well and and that's and there is a big difference in my opinion there's close friends that are more like family 

157.68 158.73 B: yeah 

158.12 166.14 A: and then then there's friends that you can know for years but they're a fr- a more distant type of friend where the um deep 

165.09 167.17 B: you don't really know 'em 

166.52 173.20 A: yes where the deep bond isn't there like you would have with friends that are more like a family member 

173.28 174.37 B: right 

176.15 182.27 B: that's the difference there's a fr- there's extended family which are friends 

182.66 187.27 B: and then there's family and then there's just people you know 

187.07 191.15 A: well exactly and you our close friends 

191.29 192.36 A: um 

192.71 205.83 A: haven't lived in the same town as in fact haven't even lived in the same state as we have for twenty five years but they're just like a family member whether i see them once a year or possibly twice a year 

205.93 209.85 A: um and they're just like family where the loyalty 

207.27 207.83 B: (( [mn] )) 

209.87 213.51 A: um is there like would be for with a family member 

213.59 215.56 B: yeah 

213.72 214.80 A: um 

215.98 220.80 A: they're just not what i would call distant friends and 

219.43 220.67 B: right 

220.86 221.79 A: like 

222.61 227.60 A: somebody you might do something with but still you don't have this close personal bond 

228.07 229.14 B: right 

228.59 232.00 A: and and what else did they ask us to talk about 

231.41 232.97 B: family 

232.37 233.49 A: (( family oh )) 

235.10 239.15 A: well do you have any comments on that how do you feel about that subject 

239.87 241.31 B: family i i 

245.07 248.88 B: i think it was family wasn't it 

247.63 251.01 A: i i didn't see i didn't hear their last sentence 

251.49 252.40 A: (( so i )) 

251.61 254.62 B: i didn't hear that too well either it was sort of blurred 

254.07 260.90 A: i just i just heard about the friends i have trouble when they give the topic it's not very clear to me 

260.54 262.01 B: yeah 

261.81 263.25 A: but see 

262.36 266.07 B: i know i talked this morning to somebody 

266.24 269.05 B: and we talked about our family 

270.80 273.96 A: so you can talk on the same subject more than once 

275.05 277.65 B: i think you can three times 

276.25 277.03 A: oh 

277.46 282.39 A: oh i didn't realize that okay well this is just my second call so 

281.89 283.85 B: how did you learn about this 

283.62 286.74 A: um on the internet through a friend 

286.41 291.26 B: yeah i did we did my wife did she's on the internet quite a bit 

290.68 294.60 A: uh-huh yes just a friend told us about it so 

294.44 295.37 B: oh 

294.94 300.43 A: i thought i'd give it a try thought this was easy money and real interesting 

300.86 303.61 B: yeah it is very interesting 

303.48 304.43 A: so 

304.51 308.92 A: [mn] can do you have any more thoughts on on the subject of friends 

309.78 311.44 B: um 

310.80 312.86 A: how do you establish friends 

312.94 314.22 A: new friends 

315.39 319.97 B: well you just run across them and either you hit or off or you don't 

319.24 320.40 A: that's true 

321.15 322.37 A: that's true 

322.24 326.08 B: and if you hit it off you see 'em again and 

326.21 340.95 A: well we're in the situation where it's a very active community um dinner dances every saturday night so we're we're always in a situation of meeting new people here whether it's at the swimming pool or 

341.07 347.81 A: and it's an extremely friendly community extremely friendly and welcoming community 

344.57 345.99 B: jeeze [sigh] 

348.01 358.59 A: and because we're in nice weather nobody's stuck in their houses so you're out walking and you're meeting somebody whether you're walking your dog or riding your bike 

352.85 353.97 B: right 

358.72 362.41 B: right when i was younger i had more friends 

359.31 360.40 A: so 

361.81 362.86 A: did you 

363.01 367.23 A: well maybe it's because you don't get out to meet new friends 

367.02 374.14 B: well we go out to restaurants and we have our friends at the rest we go to hotels 

373.91 374.94 A: uh-huh 

375.26 380.01 B: on trips in the city we don't go outside the city very much 

376.52 377.56 A: uh-huh 

379.49 380.59 A: uh-huh 

380.12 385.15 B: we stay in the city when we go to a hotel we stay there 

385.23 388.03 B: but we go back to those places 

388.33 392.14 B: and we have i guess friends there 

391.55 392.56 A: uh-huh 

392.51 395.97 B: people we know and like and get along with 

395.73 399.08 A: are your neighbors friends or are they just neighbors 

399.01 404.59 B: just neighbors we um we moved in to this place this house 

400.16 401.34 A: (( just neighbors uh-huh )) 

404.74 408.45 B: about eighteen years ago and it was um 

409.03 410.57 B: it was all white 

410.23 411.18 A: uh-huh 

410.86 413.66 B: but then the blacks have been moving in 

413.29 414.23 A: uh-huh 

414.09 416.24 B: and um 

416.80 419.54 B: it's not what it used to be 

419.83 427.94 A: well see our this when you live uh in florida in a retirement community they're all displaced northerners 

427.81 428.80 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

428.06 434.98 A: so generally all of our families are still up north and that's a good bonding 

432.06 433.03 B: yeah 

435.55 443.31 A: when when holidays come and uh everybody gets together because most of us aren't with our family 

437.88 439.12 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

443.44 447.24 A: so our friends down here become 

443.46 445.21 B: right 

445.86 446.60 B: (( [mn] [mn] [mn] )) 

447.27 453.15 A: an extension of your family just because family is always so far away 

449.88 451.33 B: right 

452.86 453.93 B: yeah 

453.21 458.34 A: almost everybody that retires here is from up north in cold weather 

458.14 459.35 B: right 

458.77 460.46 A: so um 

460.67 465.57 A: that's that's why friendships are built so fast down here 

465.51 467.27 B: right 

467.33 474.76 A: so i i don't know what else they want us to talk about do you have any more thoughts on on just the subject of friends 

475.51 476.88 B: um 

476.47 480.14 A: i know they said do you have lots or just a few 

480.56 482.77 A: and we've kinda answered that 

482.07 486.83 B: well there's a difference between what i guess you have lots 

486.62 487.78 A: (( mhm )) 

487.33 489.81 B: and i have few close 

489.80 490.98 A: (( mhm )) 

491.45 493.62 B: we have few close so 

492.83 501.02 A: well see that's what we kinda left but we're still very close to them and still see them even though they're back in michigan 

497.66 498.75 B: yeah 

501.22 502.21 B: yeah 

501.59 509.79 A: and the closest ones are twelve hours away but we still see them and they're still as dear to our heart as they were then 

510.12 511.22 B: yeah 

510.61 523.83 A: and we just don't see them on a monthly basis or couple of times a month like we used to that's all but they're you know they're long longstanding friends and as i said 

518.15 519.34 B: yeah 

523.04 525.59 B: like we have our friend that uh 

526.04 529.21 B: we we've been helping out quite a bit 

528.66 529.65 A: uh-huh 

530.11 531.70 B: and uh 

531.98 537.40 B: he's a friend of ours and he'll call us up if he has to get to a doctor appointment or 

537.42 542.30 B: the hospital or anything like that or if he needs anything he'll call us up 

541.84 542.90 A: uh-huh 

542.39 544.44 B: we won't always do it 

544.16 545.14 A: uh-huh 

545.05 548.62 B: but he knows he can count on us if it really got bad 

548.45 555.56 A: well then then then he thinks of you as a very good friend just because of your loyalty and understanding 

552.40 553.49 B: yes 

555.34 557.18 B: yeah 

557.48 559.65 B: and then we have um 

560.31 563.55 B: our in laws my in laws her parents 

563.69 567.42 B: and she's a very close friend with her mother 

568.21 571.14 B: and they do things at least once a week 

572.78 577.47 A: mhm so that those are friends that are like relatives very close friends then 

577.09 583.89 B: there's relatives and there's relatives you're friendly with some relatives and not friendly with others 

579.45 580.28 A: true 

583.33 588.08 A: true and sometimes friends can be more meaningful than some relatives 

588.10 590.14 B: that's right 

590.18 591.66 B: and uh 

592.69 594.08 B: um
