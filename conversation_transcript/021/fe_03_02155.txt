83.96 85.12 B: oh i see

88.71 94.39 B: yeah i mean i i like it getting getting stuff from whole foods and like taking it home but i'm really not that good of a cook 

94.05 95.14 A: mhm 

94.61 96.19 B: so um 

96.67 99.50 B: generally uh i uh 

99.53 107.67 B: i i like to eat out because you know i get to ex- you know experience different things experience different cuisines and stuff my 

101.11 102.10 A: mhm 

108.18 109.71 B: my uh 

109.95 122.49 B: my whole uh uh uh cooking ability is very limited and so um i like to go out to just you know get more [sigh] you know get more food you know experiences 

113.41 114.75 A: mhm 

120.80 121.79 A: (( yeah w- )) 

121.83 133.94 A: well i have a child who's allergic to dairy and um he has a problem with wheat and other grains like that and so you know that's why we really have to s- um 

125.19 126.44 B: (( oh really )) 

133.84 137.58 A: eat mostly at home because we can't take the chance [laughter] 

136.94 140.10 B: yeah i know i know a couple of people who are allergic to wheat 

140.14 148.04 B: and it's uh they they pretty much can't go out i mean they or and when they do they have to make all these you know specific instructions to people yeah i'm here 

146.32 147.28 A: (( are you there )) 

147.32 154.73 A: okay um yeah so um so i guess my perfect meal would be um 

155.51 157.39 A: steak on the grill 

157.18 158.27 B: really 

157.68 159.75 A: yeah and uh 

158.87 162.40 B: organic organic uh range fed steak 

161.87 169.29 A: right [laughter] and organic uh peppers and onions and that kind of stuff um 

162.77 163.68 B: [laughter] 

168.92 175.42 B: you know a lot of that stuff uh the organic is french for o- uh overpriced [laughter] 

173.31 185.97 A: yes [laughter] well that's what i've read but you know i can really taste the difference like if i go to um just a regular department store around here and i taste like their apples or 

175.73 176.80 B: yeah 

185.83 196.55 A: um say nectarines or th- or anything like that um i can taste the difference and also with the tomatoes tomatoes like the 

195.72 198.85 B: yeah are supposed to taste like fruit you know what i mean 

198.41 203.19 A: yeah the tomatoes like the cellophane package one where you get four in a package 

202.85 205.36 B: right 

205.32 208.80 A: i can um i can taste the chemicals in them 

208.48 209.64 B: really 

209.02 212.55 A: yeah see after a while you really can 

212.74 214.98 A: you you know like when you're away from it 

212.98 213.86 B: (( hm )) 

215.18 219.32 B: yeah see i was sort of raised on crappy food so it's uh 

218.59 220.16 A: [laughter] 

219.44 223.03 B: you know it's uh the whole i i can't really taste the difference now 

222.79 223.77 A: yeah 

223.04 234.36 B: um but you know i definitely like i think it's more flavorful and i think it's [sigh] i just you know i i think the reason why i eat it is because i you know it's a kind of sense of wellbeing like i 

234.29 248.55 B: like i um i know that what i'm eating is good for me and you know sometimes i worry about like whole foods being a chain and like you know them you know i i i'm afraid that they're not really um as healthy as they seem 

237.71 238.61 A: mhm 

248.16 249.30 A: mhm 

248.69 262.68 B: um but in general i think it's more peace of mind for me you know i think my perfect meal though [sigh] uh honestly would be sushi going out like for a sushi and having like uh you know basically being able to buy whatever i want at a really nice sushi place 

253.42 254.38 A: yeah 

262.51 265.94 A: see i don't eat any s- uh fish except for tuna fish 

265.50 269.28 B: oh god i love i'm just a sushi addict 

266.73 268.08 A: so uh 

268.90 269.95 A: yeah 

270.01 282.57 A: no i've never even tried it my daughter 'cause i i have a daughter too and she's six and she has tried you know the nonfish sushi you know like all vegetable and she loved it

294.81 307.81 B: you know i think that's how asians live longer than [laughter] anybody else and their diet i mean i lived with two japanese women for a long time and and their diet uh is is is i think part of the reason why they live so long

432.96 434.93 A: oh delicious 

435.01 446.24 B: yeah we've got some good eats uh down here i have to say i mean i just you know a lot of it is money for me like i mean even though i love restaurants and i like getting out more because mostly because i don't have to do the work you know 

445.25 446.22 A: mhm 

446.10 453.93 B: um it's a money thing you know it's pretty expensive to eat out if you want to eat well so um you know it's really more of a money thing 

449.01 449.96 A: yeah 

450.09 451.26 A: oh yeah 

453.44 454.49 A: mm 

453.89 467.75 B: and i when i ten- like i don't eat much meat but when i uh pretty much the only time i do eat meat other than fish i i eat it when i eat out so and and i'm always kind of you know scared of the beef because i don't know what's you know ranch fed and what's not 

461.26 462.62 A: mhm 

467.81 469.43 B: so um 

469.94 471.52 B: you know it's uh 

472.10 484.43 B: a lot of you know about this question you know about eating out is is has a lot to do with money for me you know it's it's really more of a money issue you know because my perfect meal would be eating out but it's like whether i can or not it's a different story 

477.07 478.08 A: oh okay 

478.71 479.68 A: yeah 

483.97 484.98 A: right 

484.78 485.71 B: so 

485.42 489.11 A: have you ever thought of um taking a cooking class [laughter]
