41.63 49.94 A: are you the kind of person that has a lot of friends and acquaintances or are you the kind of person that has couple of really close friends or 

50.64 54.62 B: oh personally i used to be i used to be 

55.51 61.60 B: i still am a social butterfly but i don't um i know lots of people but i don't have a lot of people that i'm close to 

61.74 73.30 A: really i'm the opposite [laughter] i have a closer i'm really lucky actually 'cause i've got a large close circle of good girl of good girlfriends right now [noise] 

64.11 64.90 B: you 

70.67 71.67 B: uh-huh 

73.27 78.38 A: but um but definitely like [noise] i'm i'm the kind of person that needs 

78.91 85.09 A: like a steady group of people that i know that i can count on that i know really really well 

85.55 95.45 B: i i think everybody kinda needs that to a certain degree i was i was raised military so we had we picked up every few years and left so we 

85.58 86.48 A: (( and i )) 

94.12 99.01 A: oh so you got used to sort of switching groups and switching friends 

95.80 96.71 B: yeah 

98.59 108.24 B: yeah so well yeah 'cause well yeah you just bond with your family a little bit i think better i notice that people that i went to sch- to school with they grew up together 

102.57 103.55 A: mhm 

108.35 112.11 B: you know just like at third fourth grade they grew up to high school together 

112.17 116.03 B: and they were really close to their buddies closer than they were to their family 

115.76 116.73 A: really 

116.43 117.51 B: and 

118.55 120.53 A: my my best girlfriend 

118.94 126.51 B: you know adversely i think it caused a lot of people to be like into drugs and stuff like civilians because they weren't as close to their their family 

123.91 124.90 A: really 

126.25 127.20 A: yeah 

128.07 138.79 A: [sigh] my best girlfriend actually married into the military and they're living at fort carson right now and she um she's got two kids and they're switching bases a lot 

138.36 139.54 B: mhm 

138.89 148.82 A: they've been at fort lewis out here and fort carson and um and they're only going to be at fort carson probably for another year and and she's actually been talking about how um 

145.24 146.36 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

148.89 163.02 A: how she how she's been wondering about how that's going to affect her kids her two boys because they'll get to know people and then they'll kind of be form a bond with them and then they have to move and then they have to find a whole new group of friends and [sigh] 

162.23 165.40 B: they're more they're more resilient than i think people 

165.34 174.13 B: give 'em credit for because if if anything it just made us closer as a family and and i i feel like i i benefited as far as 

173.93 181.95 B: um just just my education and what not you know i don't i didn't quite fit in with everybody else in the civilian schools because 

182.17 191.78 B: i talked differently because i was you know i travelled being well travelled just it it gave me a little bit more of an edge i think in society as far as employment and what not but 

185.30 186.33 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

192.06 196.98 B: i'm not really too concerned about having a lot a lot of friends i would like to have a couple of close friends um 

196.77 197.95 A: yeah 

198.05 198.84 B: (( you know )) 

198.20 210.24 A: that's how i am i mean you know i love having acquaintances but i'm so busy that i wind up feeling when i when i have too many people in my life i feel like i don't have enough time and then to 

209.28 212.00 B: obligated yeah spread too thin 

210.61 224.83 A: to to give the people that i do really care about the kind of attention i want to give to them and so i wind up with a with a really tight kn- tightly knit group of friends that i try to rely on really heavily and 

216.02 217.01 B: yeah 

223.39 229.27 B: well you're fortunate i mean because you know it's like i was married to a canadian guy for a while there and 

228.61 229.45 A: really 

229.35 242.58 B: he um he went to school catholic school with like twenty guys and they still all hang out together they're just like really really close and i just i thought it was kind of weird but i but cool at the same time you know 

235.97 237.21 A: really 

241.71 242.77 A: yeah 

242.66 247.05 B: uh but you just you don't see that especially stateside that often i don't think 

246.66 251.81 A: no people that have like such a history together and they've stayed close i 

251.53 252.53 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

252.48 258.30 A: mean of of the people i grew up with i know where a couple of them are and we'll talk once in a while but i don't really 

258.00 259.53 B: you just grew apart 

258.27 262.26 A: they're they're not in my they're not in my close knit group of friends 

262.04 275.23 A: so you know i'll i'll touch base with them and let them know when major events happen but but but they're not kind of in my in my day to day but i also am not living where i grew i mean i wasn't military we moved a lot too 

267.42 268.83 B: right right 

275.03 275.97 B: mhm 

275.36 278.95 A: and then i moved a lot when i became an adult and um 

279.47 286.81 A: and uh and some of my close girl well my like my girlfriend that that now she's in fort carson she's out of state so um 

287.02 298.21 A: so a lot of my a lot of my close friends have been long distance but but people yeah i don't really have anybody that i have a really long history with like i've known since third grade or went to school with and 

297.71 306.10 B: well don't you don't you feel too that like the older you get the harder it it is to meet people that are of good quality you know that are 

305.03 309.48 A: oh yeah well there's less chances i mean it's kind of if you don't meet people at work 

307.15 308.02 B: yeah 

309.42 310.88 B: right right 

309.59 310.78 A: how do you meet 'em 

310.87 312.47 A: (( you know [laughter] )) 

310.93 316.78 B: that's probably why a lot of people you know have infidelity with somebody that they work with because that's all they do is work and home [noise] [noise] 

315.46 325.49 A: yeah because that's the only people they see totally totally no i know it's it's a lot harder it's um i've been i've been lucky 'cause i've sort of stumbled in 

325.58 332.48 A: to meeting people but no it's really really difficult and dating people a couple of my girlfriends are single and um 

331.41 332.44 B: mhm 

332.58 337.28 A: and they just have a really tough time because the question is if you don't meet 'em at work 

337.55 341.81 A: how do you meet 'em you know it's just internet i know i know 

338.79 340.92 B: the internet or yeah 

341.01 343.00 B: i've been that route and oh no 

343.23 348.15 B: no no no i'm i'm single myself too and i you know i just turned thirty this last year and it's very 

349.38 351.27 B: my girlfriends that i 

351.37 354.50 B: i would say we outgrew each other they 

353.33 354.34 A: (( [sigh] [noise] yeah )) 

354.74 363.93 B: they continued to live a lifestyle that i just thought was time to grow up and you know unfortunately some of them went down the path of drugs or 

358.99 360.06 A: yeah 

363.96 368.11 B: whatever you know addicted to money or whatever their case may have been 

364.14 365.03 A: (( right )) 

368.57 371.85 B: doesn't make 'em bad people it's just i just don't want any part of it 

371.87 372.89 B: and 

371.93 376.97 A: no it's that's funny i i just turned thirty in february so we're about the same age and uh 

375.96 376.96 B: oh wow 

376.90 388.26 A: and the same thing happened i mean i there have been a lot of people prob- probably in the past say see it's been a longer process say in the past three years there've been people in my life that i've had to slowly 

388.15 392.84 A: um break ties with because that same stuff has happened it's just our 

390.13 391.08 B: right

406.40 407.75 B: and um 

408.06 416.43 B: but they they're like really into family and you know i notice that like a lot of caucasians specifically don't really have a real strong bond with their heritage 

412.75 413.87 A: mhm 

416.00 417.00 A: mhm 

416.60 429.77 B: that you know like say maybe you know like african americans i don't know if it's just because they're all black but but you know what i mean they have that bonding or like italians they have their culture and hispanics and i don't feel like white people really have that
