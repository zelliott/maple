34.98 39.86 A: oh good well then i'm s- i'm sure i shall come across one soon [laughter] 

39.17 41.15 B: right [laughter] 

41.78 42.81 A: um 

43.13 48.69 A: so we're supposed to talk about whether we like to eat at home or in a restaurant 

48.80 54.36 B: well i guess really person- personally speaking myself i guess it depends on the occasion 

54.45 59.75 A: yeah i think that too 'cause sometimes i think making food at home is really fun 

59.19 66.12 B: right like sometimes um like i i belong to this like you you get like a recipe each day on the web 

66.03 67.28 A: oh how fun 

67.07 74.68 B: yeah and i really i really enjoy making some of the meals because you know it's something new rather than always having the same old thing at home 

74.85 83.51 B: but sometimes like [sigh] i i love cooking for my relatives but i have a very big family so sometimes [laughter] it's really 

82.25 84.53 A: so it's a big production [laughter] 

83.91 90.74 B: yes exactly and it's a lot of clean up even with even if you do paper plates it's still a lot of clean up so in 

90.03 99.79 A: it is yeah well there's always pots and pans and stuff yeah i think definitely like i y- making meals at home is much more of a commitment you know 

97.94 100.18 B: right exactly 

99.89 101.05 A: yeah 

100.04 114.17 B: an- and i mean i- it sometimes y- the one thing though about eating at home is portion control and how like just eating healthier 'cause sometimes when you go to a restaurant [laughter] they give you like this por- you know just the portions they give 

106.27 107.42 A: yeah 

112.89 118.13 A: oh they do they give you tons of food and you go i can't possibly eat all this 

116.85 121.18 B: and you try and eat it while you're there you know you don't think about it so 

119.14 120.35 A: yeah 

120.63 125.04 A: yeah yeah that's definitely not not as cool 

124.60 125.66 B: no 

125.65 126.43 A: (( no )) 

126.38 126.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

127.02 131.10 B: but i mean um in fact i'm cooking right now as we speak so 

130.54 132.40 A: oh cool what are you making 

131.65 136.73 B: i am making floppy joes with [noise] pirogies [noise] and broccoli 

136.66 140.39 A: oh how fun i love pirogies 

137.88 138.93 B: (( so )) 

139.76 142.06 B: (( yeah so do i. [laughter] )) 

141.14 145.20 A: (( pirogies are like ul- ultimate [laughter] )) 

144.22 150.02 B: yes they are they're so good now i'm not making homemade pirogies but i'm just making regular you know 

150.16 150.98 B: the ones 

150.22 153.81 A: well you can get good ones now and you know 

152.42 153.68 B: yeah well 

153.70 154.77 B: and they're cheap 

155.29 166.28 B: so that's the well that's the other thing about eating at home now it's much like the one thing we notice my husband and i both used to work and when i had the baby i decided to come home 

155.44 156.52 A: yeah 

166.29 169.99 B: and i work i work part time from home i telecommute now 

166.50 167.69 A: yeah 

170.07 170.87 A: uh-huh 

170.36 171.82 B: and he works full time 

171.88 179.13 B: the one thing we notice is our we haven't been spending as much money because we used to go out to eat all the time when we worked 

179.20 191.18 B: so after we'd get off work we'd go out to eat or if we were at lunch like because we worked in the same place we would go to lunch together and we were spending exorbitant amounts of money each month on that 

191.01 194.57 A: oh yeah it is a lot it adds up fast 

191.86 192.63 B: (( yeah )) 

193.93 194.83 B: yeah 

194.98 200.06 A: yeah so it yeah eating at home is definitely more cost effective 

199.65 200.46 B: yes 

200.54 207.56 B: so for that reason too i mean de- and with a baby for us you know it it's it's just wiser you know 

206.97 213.11 A: yeah you and you can't really take the baby out and have like a quiet peaceful meal [laughter] and eat 

211.81 215.41 B: no not any more [laughter] 

213.82 217.26 A: no the baby is not into that 

216.49 220.09 B: [laughter] yeah that's very true 

217.85 219.45 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

220.49 225.80 A: yeah i mean you have to get somebody to watch the baby and it just becomes even more of a production 

225.29 232.74 B: right exactly it's like we we try to do it my husband and i now we try to do like once a month we have what's called date night 

232.87 234.38 A: oh cute 

233.74 244.28 B: yeah it's very nice we go out we literally have like our old dates like what we used to do like we'll go to the movies and go to dinner and [noise] have like a really nice peaceful dinner you know [laughter] 

243.61 249.24 A: yeah well i think that's a great idea it's great that you're making time for that 

244.37 245.87 B: and have a couple of 

246.79 247.56 B: yeah 

248.67 251.43 B: you have to you really do so 

250.04 255.36 A: i yeah i think that too but you'd be surprised how many people don't even think about it 

254.69 262.81 B: right and they're the people who are totally probably whacked and stressed out by the point you know what i mean like it it it's a lot i- it's a lot so 

259.23 260.10 A: yeah 

262.84 265.57 B: you really need it [noise] specially for your 

262.91 263.80 A: yeah 

264.47 265.35 A: (( i don't [mn] )) 

265.91 268.95 B: for your you know just for your yourself so 

268.38 283.06 A: you do well you need this for your relationship 'cause it really just gives you an opportunity to to bond all over again and get to know each other all over again which you don't have time for when you're with the baby and you know you're doing stuff at home and [mn] 

270.87 272.03 B: (( right [mn] )) 

282.86 284.63 A: (( you know all that )) 

284.02 290.17 B: right well what what kind of like if you go out to eat where do you what's like your favorite place to eat at 

289.18 292.24 A: um i i like japanese food 

291.65 297.24 B: (( okay i was thinking oh i love japanese food and ah where do you live [noise] )) 

292.60 294.31 A: a lot [laughter] 

297.04 298.14 A: l._a. 

298.12 302.44 B: la okay well i live um outside of philadelphia 

302.37 303.66 A: oh okay 

303.07 314.98 B: and there [noise] is this incredible japanese food [noise] place um [noise] it's like literally like the sush- they have sushi that like sits on a it's like a how do i describe it 

314.71 315.60 A: (( [mn] )) 

315.29 318.97 B: oh god it it sits on this like belt 

319.13 321.65 B: and the belt comes around 

319.20 322.52 A: oh okay like it's oh yeah we have those too 

322.29 323.27 B: (( do you )) 

322.70 324.05 A: (( todai )) 

324.76 330.81 B: it's what's it called it's called something easy like the spot or something like that it's called 

330.21 337.75 A: uh-huh yeah we have those too and it comes by and you just take off whatever you want yeah it's so fun 

333.58 336.06 B: (( yes it's so neat )) 

337.18 338.72 B: (( yes ahah )) 

338.12 343.65 A: yeah i love sushi and also 'cause i can't really make it at home 'cause i don't know enough about fish 

343.20 344.38 B: right 

343.82 349.29 A: so and that's one thing i always try to do if i go out i try to have food that i can't make at home 

348.68 355.82 B: yeah that's a great idea because you know there are things like why do you even want to [laughter] spend two hours in the kitchen [laughter] 

353.40 354.90 A: yeah like 

355.22 363.72 A: yeah ex- exactly like i'm not going to go out and have something i can make at home 'cause i'd rather make it at home and [laughter] i know i'm gonna like it better if i make it 

362.36 364.26 B: right exactly 

363.74 371.17 A: [laughter] [laughter] so i always try to have stuff that's either like super super fancy that i just would never take that much time [lipsmack] 

370.41 371.80 B: mhm 

371.36 376.48 A: um or stuff like you know that i can't do just because i don't know enough about it like sushi 

376.33 380.80 B: [noise] [noise] right now out in l._a. do you guys [noise] have good italian restaurants [noise] [noise] 

377.30 378.27 A: and stuff 

380.65 387.26 A: you know it's actually it's funny that you mention that 'cause i was just talking to somebody about how we don't have enough 

386.74 387.89 B: uh-huh [noise] 

387.35 392.07 A: i mean we have good ones but they're like super super expensive 

391.54 392.58 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

392.17 402.21 A: and then we have like two good ones that aren't that that expensive but not like 'cause i know in pennsylvania you guys have just italian restaurants everywhere [noise] 

394.50 395.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

400.28 401.43 B: oh it's 

401.53 405.98 B: yeah well it's like the that's pretty much the cornerstone of meals here [laughter] 

405.60 412.56 A: yeah and we don't have that and it there was a lot of times that i missed that 'cause i just love italian 

406.67 407.45 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

412.14 413.16 B: (( right [noise] )) 

413.17 421.90 A: and it's you know i'll make it but i get really obsessive about it like i like to make my own pasta [laughter] and i like to make my own sauce and stuff 

419.23 420.25 B: right 

420.74 431.13 B: oh well you gotta make you own sauce now that's that's one of the things that a lot of like [noise] i don't really [noise] like to eat at those italian restaurants like t- like the olive garden yeah 

423.32 424.41 A: (( oh yeah )) 

430.57 433.74 A: yeah i don't like those either 'cause that's not real 

432.62 439.50 B: 'cause you yeah why don't i just go out and buy myself a frozen dinner and cook it [noise] you know because they pretty much taste the same but yeah 

438.92 445.19 A: i know i'm like that too and like i ha- it has to be totally real and i want to like see the 

443.58 450.19 B: oh it's a shame you don't live out this way we sound like two connoisseurs here you know like [laughter] uh
