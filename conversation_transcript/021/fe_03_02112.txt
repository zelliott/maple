216.94 220.73 A: and uh i i keep in touch with him and um 

220.95 227.18 A: but the relationship changes after you're not in close proximity to the person 

227.30 228.03 A: (( you know )) 

227.36 229.20 B: oh yeah 

228.09 235.20 A: i mean because certainly people change but um it's funny how you tend to um 

235.90 243.20 A: uh revert to the person that you were when you were around them when you are with them you know 

242.21 248.35 B: [sigh] exactly yeah we can still bust each other up with just one little funny word [laughter] 

244.77 246.05 A: kind of interesting 

248.18 262.52 A: yeah yeah and um you know like my girlfriend she won't i mean she'll see a side of me that possibly no one else has seen other than my best friend the one i best friend which is kind of uh 

258.87 260.82 B: mhm 

262.89 265.47 A: endearing and disconcerting i'm sure 

265.46 266.37 B: yeah 

265.61 267.13 A: [laughter] you know 

267.46 272.88 B: i moved to austin about five years ago so i've got all all new friends now i met a girl and moved up here 

272.71 286.75 B: and i i was just back in houston where i used to live and thought well i could go visit this guy and i could go visit that girl and i could visit these people and ah what the hell forget it you know [laughter] [laughter] i don't keep up with them anymore [laughter] 

272.74 273.79 A: (( mhm )) 

279.64 280.77 A: yeah 

281.15 282.97 A: yeah yeah 

284.44 285.94 A: yeah 

286.33 287.78 A: yeah 

287.27 291.23 B: although i did drive around a little bit to see what buildings had changed [laughter] 

290.55 291.55 A: uh-huh 

291.72 301.21 A: yeah i did i did that i did that when i went back to california recently to to see my parents and i i drove drove through the neighborhood to see where 

301.50 308.17 A: you know all my friends lived and then it had all changed and different people different communities 

305.52 307.09 B: yeah 

308.36 313.50 B: now back when i was kid ed and i also ran with a guy named steve and for like the last twenty years steve 

313.48 324.07 B: ed and i have been thinking of tracking down steve and we have made furtive attempts over the years and now since the internet's here it seems like it would be easier but there's no telling where steve is if he's even still alive 

316.19 317.07 A: (( mhm )) 

320.72 321.55 A: right 

324.07 325.18 A: yeah but 

324.43 327.38 B: [laughter] we were all really tight at you know at that age 

326.17 327.61 A: yeah but 

327.53 332.75 B: and since we haven't keeped up kept up with each other there's no telling what he's like today if he's still with us 

332.05 337.12 A: yeah oh yeah yeah i actually got a it it's interesting i got a 

333.16 334.51 B: [laughter] 

337.13 340.62 A: email from a guy i was really good friends with in high school 

341.22 351.65 A: i hadn't you know spoken to him in ten years and he sent me this huge email about his whole life post high school and how right after high school you know 

351.56 363.88 A: he had a child and you know he had all these problems and got back on track and went back to college and it was it was just really you know really neat to see that you know to but i i don't have 

364.15 369.88 A: there's something i mean i'm not really too compelled to 

370.90 382.47 A: to keep that friendship really you know close or anything more than simply you know a good friend i used to have and now i know his email address and now i know where he is 

381.76 383.67 B: mhm 

383.22 384.16 A: um 

384.60 389.06 B: no i'm considering next year'll be my twenty fifth uh high school re- reunion 

388.93 389.87 A: oh wow 

389.12 391.64 B: i'm thinking of going back to that 

390.88 393.03 A: yeah yeah i've 

391.95 392.83 B: just because 

393.52 395.10 A: [sigh] i've gotten 

394.07 396.72 B: haven't been to the old hood in a while [laughter] oh 

395.74 403.80 A: yeah well yeah that's that's yeah i'm always afraid of like you know people who you knew who i mean i knew a guy 

404.14 412.27 A: uh in high school and then in college i found out he had committed suicide and that kind of rooted me out and i i'm i'm a that's 

412.77 417.88 A: that that's kind of scary for me to see who is there and who's not there anymore 

418.05 420.97 A: you know you mentioned that earlier and 

421.22 427.60 A: that's that's one fear i think and then just to see people getting old is kind of a another 

423.48 424.59 B: [sigh] did you 

427.00 438.90 B: yeah it's inevitable though i look at myself in the mirror and i still think of myself as the same little kid but i know i'm different [laughter] did you live in the same place growing up or did you move around 

427.62 428.55 A: (( age thing you )) 

432.45 433.93 A: (( know i know i know )) 

434.11 435.52 A: no i mean they are 

437.01 439.64 A: yeah yeah i grew up in the bay area 

439.73 440.85 B: (( oh okay )) 

439.75 441.54 A: (( california yeah )) 

441.37 451.90 B: we moved around it seemed like every year we lived in l._a. even for a couple of years back in the late sixties but i don't that's part of why i don't have many very what i would call very close friends 'cause we kept moving so much 

444.97 445.77 A: oh 

446.08 446.99 A: uh-huh 

450.42 451.42 A: yeah 

451.67 453.61 A: right right right 

454.64 456.08 A: yeah 

454.68 455.64 B: (( i don't know )) 

456.25 468.30 B: plus people are strange [laughter] and actually probably my last my last really good really good friend uh passed on from liver cancer and this would have been six years ago now 

457.91 459.78 A: yeah [laughter] yeah 

460.45 462.47 A: yeah and 

467.70 468.73 A: oh 

468.13 472.00 B: and i only got to know him about the last five years of his life and he was a real good guy 

471.01 471.79 A: oh 

471.93 472.85 A: yeah 

472.17 474.83 B: he and his wife and i would do all sorts of stuff together 

474.54 475.48 A: (( wow )) 

475.24 481.01 B: he's gone now she done moved to new york and married another guy so i don't talk to her very often any more [laughter] 

475.76 476.50 A: so 

478.55 479.43 A: uh-huh 

480.29 485.85 A: right now now uh do find that your uh closer friends are um 

485.86 490.23 A: are male or female what is there a gender divide 

489.48 494.39 B: oh that's a really tough one probably an even mixture of both um 

493.26 495.10 A: (( yeah myself too )) 

495.76 503.63 B: um my honey would probably get a little jealous if she knew that but [laughter] 

499.86 504.27 A: right right exactly yeah yeah my my girlfriend gets 

504.31 513.94 A: yeah she like you know she gets a a little jealous when i talk to a good friend i've known for a long time on the phone and about problems and stuff you know but 

510.93 512.64 B: yeah 

513.39 524.28 B: but then again she still keeps up with some of her old boyfriends i mean she's the kind of girl that is friends with everybody for their entire life and i in fact i met her at one of her ex boyfriend's uh 

516.45 517.45 A: right 

519.82 521.31 A: right right 

524.14 534.07 B: at at at his farm one day at a weekend event we were both volunteering at this event and so we hooked up so it's all good you know [laughter] 

529.41 530.63 A: oh wow 

530.99 532.24 A: [laughter] 

532.72 534.46 A: (( yeah i'm i mean )) 

534.48 540.66 A: yeah i'm kind of the type of person to once a relationship is over it's kind of over over 

540.69 541.45 A: so 

541.97 542.91 A: i don't know 

542.09 552.94 B: well i i am kind of that way too though when when it uh girl wise it's over but the girls that i would say were are my friends still are ones that i never did have a romantic relationship with 

544.20 545.22 A: yeah 

551.46 559.73 A: right yeah yeah yeah that that's that's the interesting thing though that those memories 

558.99 562.84 B: although there's one or two going back to my early twenties that i still keep up with you 

562.67 564.30 A: yeah 

563.45 571.10 B: know we're just probably because we live so far away we can do that [laughter] you know [laughter] 

566.69 567.57 A: right 

567.59 568.28 A: (( that's )) 

569.10 570.26 A: (( right )) 

570.39 574.05 A: do you do you have a um easy time making new friends 

574.78 583.23 B: [lipsmack] um not really i'm fairly gregarious but i i do i do not oh man it's hard that's hard to say 

577.86 578.92 A: (( mhm )) 

583.52 586.18 B: it's hard it's hard to put that into words because 

586.39 599.89 B: when if someone is my friend i i would give of myself to them no mat- if they needed anything you know they got it and that level of trust you can't just give to everybody 'cause you'll die real soon so [laughter] [laughter] so i guess in in some sense i do limit 

590.35 591.29 A: mhm 

591.76 592.61 A: right 

596.06 597.29 A: (( exactly exactly ))
