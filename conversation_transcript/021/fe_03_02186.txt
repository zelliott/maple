6.19 10.28 B: okay [laughter] me neither well i'm laurie 

9.87 10.99 A: i'm barb 

10.71 19.60 B: okay um okay our topic is food i guess whi- which do we enjoy eating the most i guess in a restaurant or at home 

19.20 20.55 A: right 

19.80 20.74 B: (( okay )) 

20.70 35.45 B: um [laughter] well i enjoy going to a restaurant more but it's more convenient to do it at home because i've got a three and a four year old so it' s more of a hassle to go to the restaurant but i love going to the restaurant i love going out to eat 

31.59 33.02 A: oh but it's 

35.16 40.27 A: well when somebody else prepares it for you and cleans it up and 

37.11 38.12 B: i know 

40.38 42.95 A: gives you a choice of what you want 

42.28 43.86 B: (( i know )) 

43.20 45.64 A: it's just delightful [laughter] 

44.70 55.87 B: it is it is it's a lot of work but you know i got this um this new book that actually just came today i ordered it it's the suzanne sommer sommercize and it has all these recipes in it 

55.46 56.68 A: oh 

55.89 69.94 B: so i thought well you know maybe if they're easy enough to to do you know maybe i'll start cooking more at home and that'll be easier but they're supposed to be pretty good recipes and i've got a whole two um a set of two books that came so 

69.43 78.45 A: well if you have a good recipe and it's something everybody'll eat then you know that always seems to be the best part about eating at home 

78.01 78.95 B: right 

78.76 84.70 A: um we tend to eat at lot of chicken and broccoli and um [lipsmack] 

85.23 97.07 A: so it's always a treat to go somewhere else because then you get such a different you know you get a variety a better variety but you've got little kids though that makes it a little harder 

88.62 89.93 B: oh yeah 

93.30 94.80 B: yeah 

96.60 104.62 B: it does it does it makes it i mean 'cause you know it's it it's when they're three and four they're harder to they have a short attention span 

104.47 106.00 A: mhm 

104.48 105.37 B: so 

105.21 118.60 B: you know to take them out they're they're okay for about ten minutes but after that first ten minutes they're like okay wanna go play now you know we're done you [laughter] you know [laughter] so you if you take if we take the kids we have to find one of those you know 

110.68 112.33 A: we're done [laughter] 

112.87 115.16 A: (( mm mhm )) 

118.41 120.67 B: quote unquote family restaurants 

120.51 121.80 A: mhm 

120.82 132.39 B: and that's not my idea where i'd really want to go they love going to like the pizza place pizza buffet well they're happy that is not mommy and daddy's idea of going out to dinner [laughter] 

127.62 128.85 A: mhm 

130.89 145.11 A: no it's um our girls i remember when they were at that age they're thirteen and sixteen now so i- i've already been through that but it's um [lipsmack] it's sure a treat when you do get to eat out just i think um 

145.98 151.92 A: [sigh] 'cause somebody else gets to do all the thinking and preparing and [laughter] 

151.11 155.21 B: well it's just ea- it's just fun it's nice to get away from the house 

154.78 156.10 A: mhm 

155.43 164.94 B: it is so although i'm not home a lot either i mean i guess if i were at home all the time i'd really be glad to go but i'm not home all the time but even if i w- 

157.15 158.28 A: i remember 

165.03 169.77 B: even if i were i'd i think i'd still want to go out more to eat out 

168.18 172.85 A: well it it's yeah we use our entertainment book a lot 

172.45 175.09 B: (( mhm oh we've got one of those too )) 

174.60 177.41 A: oh w- i got one probably oh 

177.55 188.52 A: seven years ago or so as a gift and since then we've used it as a fundraiser we if it's we don't have a coupon were not going [laughter] 

180.05 181.18 B: (( mhm )) 

187.32 202.03 B: [laughter] oh my g- you know i have i actually have two of them and believe it or not i have not used them yet i just haven't bothered to open them up but i've heard people who say those things are great and i'm like okay well maybe one day i'll get around to looking at it 

190.75 191.93 A: mhm 

195.68 196.95 A: oh 

200.92 206.83 A: well open the front and get your little card out and get online and register your card 

206.28 207.30 B: okay 

206.89 213.11 A: and then they'll send you an email every once in a while like with a new restaurant in the area and that might remind you 

212.87 216.58 B: oh okay so it really is a good bargain though 

215.80 221.21 A: it is and i mean if you guys go out to dinner just the two of you one time 

220.88 221.94 B: mhm 

221.63 224.76 A: for something nice you've more than paid your book back 

224.57 229.72 B: wow yeah 'cause the book was pretty cheap like twenty bucks or something yeah 

225.34 226.50 A: and we 

228.05 229.14 A: right 

229.15 239.51 A: when um [lipsmack] two pizzas and you've got it covered you know and most times it's a pizza that they'll bring you so you don't unless i keep my books in the car 

232.60 233.63 B: okay 

239.18 240.48 B: mhm 

239.85 244.61 A: and so that way you know when you're out if you think of something then you've got 'em 

244.27 245.18 B: right 

245.02 252.28 A: so th- that was the key for me to start using them and now it's just such a habit so we're 

245.24 246.21 B: right 

250.83 252.82 B: wow okay 

252.53 254.68 A: we're in the southern california area 

254.67 257.06 B: okay and we're in florida 

255.67 256.49 A: where 

256.65 257.77 A: oh okay 

257.29 259.17 B: yeah we're pretty far apart 

257.80 258.52 A: so 

258.79 261.30 A: we are at opposite ends of the country 

259.62 262.66 B: (( oh my yeah )) 

262.06 263.86 A: but i know um 

263.88 268.03 A: it it sure made our eating out a little more reasonable 

267.68 269.63 B: (( okay okay )) 

268.56 270.32 A: then you feel like it's not 

271.09 273.12 A: you can afford it more 

272.54 281.12 B: now it i i guess are the restaurants more expensive in california i i i think florida i don't think that things are that expensive 

277.41 278.27 A: it just 

280.28 285.46 A: it just depends where you go you know i mean if you want a really really nice out to eat [sigh] 

281.78 282.77 B: okay 

286.44 295.46 A: it depends on you know how sometimes your salad is separate and your entree's separate and you know your side dish is separate [mn] 

290.18 291.66 B: yeah 

291.92 293.06 B: yeah 

296.16 301.25 A: that's just once a year maybe [laughter] 

299.66 301.63 B: right right 

301.21 313.79 A: but um we found the fine dining in the book a lot of times you can go somewhere very nice for something special an anniversary or birthday or just a real special date for you guys that 

313.77 320.14 A: that really helps on the expense end but it's i know sometimes it's just kind of fun 

315.37 316.47 B: okay 

320.16 328.16 A: especially when the girls were little darryl would like to go out with them because it was kinda like dad got to show the kids off too
