246.01 247.26 B: [laughter] 

247.80 256.33 B: so n- you know i basically i was um i'm getting to a point where i'm very and i've been drastic at time i'm getting ready to go 

256.14 267.40 B: really drastic and eat only fruits and vegetables for a while only because my body is not feeling uh normal it's it's and when it when i feel this way 

267.70 278.72 B: usually if i clean myself out like that because then not only do you um lose a lot of weight which i- it's not really a weight thing but uh you feel incredibly great 

279.04 281.77 A: just heard about this i read it in um 

282.08 287.87 A: a book like fit for life or something by some guy is that the the same 

284.90 286.17 B: yeah yeah 

287.21 299.91 B: well no no actually it's uh i've i've i've just done it before when i've i've done a cleansing because uh uh i actually had gained some weight and ow in when i was about uh 

292.94 293.95 A: (( uh-huh mhm [laughter] )) 

299.86 306.36 B: in my thirties and i i've got because my wife was um at the time i was married and she was 

306.46 312.78 B: uh cooking all this food and uh we were just pigging out and um [lipsmack] 

313.32 321.49 B: so uh i had to clean myself out and that's then i did it with um i just ate fruits and vegetables and then i 

321.51 330.50 B: i did you know took vitamins to uh get the proper nutrition but i did it with a doctor and boy i lost a lot of weight [cough] and uh 

331.46 335.79 B: [sigh] you know i was really aware of how i was feeling 

335.85 337.14 B: and which is 

337.17 341.49 B: basically you know on- once you eat and you eat a big meal 

341.81 352.64 B: and uh i was conscious of how that made me feel afterwards even though it was good going down but what did it make you feel like afterwards 

352.13 353.68 A: oh [laughter] 

353.48 359.85 B: because if you're stuffed and you're at that point where oh i can't move but then once it goes away then y- 

359.87 364.16 B: there was a tendency t- to stay at that full point 

363.61 364.85 A: yeah 

364.22 368.98 B: and then once you stay at that full point then you don't notice 

368.93 380.07 B: that any more and you um make the barrier a bigger barrier to get to that oh that point where you need to roll me out of here but um 

376.25 377.04 A: [laughter] 

381.56 393.24 B: i don't know i just uh right now since i you know i've never been forty nine or i'm actually going to be fifty this year and and to me you know i'm still eighteen or nineteen 'cause that's how i remember myself 

387.47 388.32 A: [laughter] 

388.68 389.62 A: (( happy birthday )) 

392.76 393.78 A: yeah 

393.16 405.84 B: uh uh i'm experiencing uh physically what not mentally but physically what it's like to be and my body's just not the same as it was so remember that you're twenty one now it's 

404.32 407.03 A: (( yeah [laughter] hm mhm )) 

405.81 415.82 B: and and it's just like a blink of an eye you're you're like going to be uh thirty and then you're going to be forty and then and each each of those increments your body 

415.88 419.94 B: uh that energy level is not the same and you can't really eat 

420.27 425.20 B: what you used to you know you can go to burger king but it just isn't going to do it any more 

424.58 427.19 A: yeah oh 

425.45 426.42 B: you know 

427.20 432.58 A: so when you do the the fruit and vegetable thing how long do you do it like for just a couple of days or what 

431.47 437.08 B: i've done no no i've done it for six weeks you lose an incredible amount of weight but you feel 

434.99 436.16 A: wow 

437.12 449.44 B: beautiful oh it's like you're a kid it's like the energy of a little kid yeah i just it just and then you start to think oh my god can i ever go back to real food and then you know you do but you do 

446.93 448.66 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

449.40 453.05 B: and then it it gets where you forget the feeling 

452.86 453.79 A: uh-huh 

453.53 456.81 B: it's a it's a beautiful thing um you know 

456.90 460.56 B: some people never go back because uh they realize 

460.65 465.26 B: um you know the just the benefit of um 

465.88 470.65 B: you know just eating uh properly 'cause you you can really get into some 

470.68 480.17 B: um products and and you start looking at labels and seeing what they're putting in the food and at at 

478.06 479.45 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

480.15 492.44 B: mass consumption uh they're just it's kind of addictive [laughter] sugar and white flour and they're putting certain ingredients in that that only makes you want to you know eat more so 

491.74 502.47 A: yeah yeah i see that see i've 'cause i've read about that before and that sounded really interesting to me but i've never actually known anybody who did that so it's 

501.16 515.12 B: yeah i've done it several times it's it's a good thing it the hardest part is the first couple of days 'cause you're in a habit of just grabbing anything but once you break that habit in the first couple of days you're like you're good to go 

510.05 511.04 A: yeah 

514.83 516.24 A: yeah 

515.57 520.72 B: but then you start you know you're head starts tripping 'cause you're lightheaded so you start 

519.18 519.88 A: (( but )) 

520.07 521.19 A: [laughter] 

520.78 522.56 B: so you got to watch that too 

523.01 524.20 A: 'cause you know 

524.32 525.58 A: (( yeah 'cause it's ))
