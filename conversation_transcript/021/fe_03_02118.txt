0.36 2.48 A: hello i'm kim 

2.10 5.21 B: hi my name is francesca what's your name again 

4.98 5.91 A: kim 

5.59 7.18 B: kim how're you doing kim 

6.80 8.12 A: good how are you 

7.57 9.50 B: all right where're you from 

9.59 11.70 A: um i'm from georgia 

11.35 13.61 B: oh okay i'm from philadelphia 

12.21 13.06 A: and 

13.55 15.60 A: oh really i live in chicago 

15.35 16.73 B: oh okay okay 

16.60 17.57 A: [laughter] 

17.52 22.85 B: [sigh] so our topic for today is friends and 

21.01 22.43 A: yes 

22.99 25.00 B: uh i think one of the questions 

25.14 30.31 B: was do you have a lot of friends or do you just have a few close friends 

30.62 36.89 A: well right now i don't have a lot of friends i just moved to this city about two months ago so 

36.16 37.75 B: oh okay 

37.35 38.86 A: but generally 

39.13 46.94 A: i have a few close friends and i usually just have a lot of other acquaintances with varying degrees of closeness 

46.61 49.10 B: [sigh] right right 

47.72 49.47 A: and and yourself 

49.39 51.54 B: me i have 

52.52 54.87 B: i would say i have a few friends 

55.03 57.26 B: uh maybe 

57.54 59.78 B: one best friend 

60.15 71.35 B: and i i can honestly say i don't have the same relationship with my best friend as i did like years ago when i was in high school and you would tell your best friend everything 

71.06 72.03 A: mhm 

71.40 80.47 B: now it's you know we hardly because of our lives we're so busy we really don't get a chance to even sit down and talk and 

80.49 82.81 B: go out that much but um 

82.75 84.36 A: that's too bad 

83.75 88.85 B: and i think that's another reason why i only have a few friends because i don't have enough time 

89.16 94.34 B: to go out and really meet people because of work and school 

94.71 99.52 B: so with you being in chicago how do you go out and meet people 

99.71 108.03 A: well i really haven't much [laughter] lately i um probably the one friend that i've made here is a girl that i work with 

107.40 108.41 B: okay 

107.98 121.13 A: and she's very nice and i had the opportunity last night there was um this girl was having a party and she wanted to introduce me to all her friends but i just was really tired and i had to work today so 

121.28 126.55 A: it was like the first social opportunity i'd had and i i just couldn't go [laughter] 

125.67 129.20 B: okay right right but you know what there'll be so much more 

129.09 130.95 A: i hope so [laughter] 

129.99 136.78 B: especially you know the weather's changing it's getting a little warmer i don't know how the weather is in chicago 

135.92 140.65 A: it it seems like it might be getting warmer now today was actually 

141.06 143.41 A: low seventies but 

142.55 143.54 B: okay 

143.87 144.83 B: okay 

144.87 150.99 B: and that's when i don't know people are going to start going out and having barbecues and 

151.15 152.15 A: yeah 

151.79 160.45 B: yeah that's what i told my friends they asked me what when's the next barbecue i think that's the only reason why they're probably my friend just to come over and have and eat 

155.82 156.75 A: [laughter] 

160.27 161.42 A: [laughter] 

160.91 164.69 B: so uh but usually um 

165.02 171.06 B: my close friends that i have uh we will go out um to the mall 

171.09 179.22 B: then go out to dinner we try our best to get together at least once a month and go out to eat 

179.77 183.64 B: and uh i most of my friends are teachers i'm a teacher 

183.36 184.08 A: (( mm )) 

183.88 185.41 B: so um 

185.52 198.00 B: but when i first started out we all worked in the same school and now we're scattered around at different schools and some people left so we try to get together at least once a month to um 

185.58 186.31 A: do 

195.41 196.10 A: mm 

198.79 201.40 B: just [sigh] talk and you know 

201.94 203.94 B: we don't want to you know miss that 

204.48 208.01 B: that bonding and that friendship so we don't want to 

208.69 212.02 B: have years go by and then not get a chance to 

212.50 214.75 B: to see each other or talk to each other 

215.23 217.50 A: yeah what do you teach 

217.06 218.63 B: i teach kindergarten 

218.52 219.91 A: oh wow 

219.31 220.92 B: yeah so 

221.16 223.49 B: i teach the little babies 

223.07 227.83 A: [laughter] i bet they wouldn't like it if they heard you call them babies [laughter] 

223.68 224.88 B: and 

227.01 231.09 B: you know what i call i call them babies in the classroom [laughter] and they 

230.10 231.67 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

231.26 241.47 B: i tell them you're my babies and they're like some of them they're they're so excited like oh yeah you know i'm i'm her baby but then the other ones are like specially 

241.70 254.65 B: the older like the six year olds that just turned six throughout the year they're like i'm not a baby i'm a i'm a big girl i'm like no you're not [laughter] but it's it's great 

245.47 246.50 A: mhm 

247.68 249.38 A: [laughter] 

251.35 252.60 A: [laughter] 

254.73 256.80 B: but all day 

256.91 259.16 B: you're with five and six year olds 

258.58 261.90 A: yeah you need some time to be with adults 

259.24 260.58 B: so it's like 

261.25 267.01 B: i know so having friends is like just getting on the phone and talking to somebody 

267.38 272.11 B: i said this is great and like i have but then most then i have friends who 

268.97 269.82 A: [laughter] 

273.10 286.55 B: all they do is talk on the phone at their jobs they're all used to like talking so that's why we try to get together everyone loves to eat so if you just go out to eat you tell them i'll take you out to eat then they're ready to go 

275.66 276.87 A: yeah 

281.76 282.88 A: (( [laughter] )) 

287.09 287.96 A: (( mm )) 

287.71 289.81 B: so why did you move to chicago 

290.14 299.71 A: [lipsmack] well um for a change of scenery and and new opportunities um my boyfriend just graduated college we live together 

293.67 294.73 B: okay 

299.31 300.30 B: okay 

299.88 310.95 A: and um he graduated from the university of georgia and i he's never lived in a big city before um i lived in new york for a few months once and um 

311.94 320.46 A: so for me it was you know it wasn't really that weird to come here only it doesn't really feel so much like a big city in chicago as it does in new york 

320.21 324.84 B: okay i've never been to chicago before i would love to go but 

324.08 328.10 A: it's a very beautiful town it's just a lot more spread out than um 

328.53 331.25 A: than new york is it's not as concentrated 

331.60 333.59 B: now did you have to leave 

333.80 337.48 B: good friends when you were in uh georgia 

337.26 339.17 A: well i left 

339.39 344.46 A: probably who the person who was like my best friend um 

344.75 353.40 A: we'd been friends since i was in high school and he's a couple of years older than me and we still talk a lot and he calls me and i actually worked with him 

353.49 364.44 A: right before we moved um he he's the manager at a hotel and um we worked the night audit together so we got to spend a lot of time together before 

364.93 366.69 A: i i moved but 

366.77 370.82 A: i think in a way me moving is a good thing for him because i think that 

371.33 375.27 A: um he has a lot of growing to do in his life 

374.63 379.07 B: okay okay now how did your parents feel about the move 

376.30 377.06 A: so it's 

378.34 379.03 A: (( [mn] )) 

379.15 387.69 A: well they're they're starting to get used to it just 'cause ever since i was eighteen i've i've been going off to one place or another i also lived in london for about half a year 

387.24 388.50 B: (( wow )) 

388.25 393.19 A: um i just have always been kind of a a nomad [laughter] 

392.62 394.51 B: okay okay 

393.36 405.72 A: so but the thing is this is the first time where they weren't enraged by the fact that i was moving and i think it has a lot to do with my boyfriend i think they see my life as more stabilized now which i guess it is 

399.50 400.36 B: [laughter] 

405.13 406.32 B: okay 

406.42 407.52 B: okay
