31.37 32.48 B: yeah 

31.89 40.26 A: actually you're the first person i've talked to that's in california usually the people i talk to are like in are in texas um let me think washington places like that [laughter] so 

39.59 48.51 B: yeah i only this is my second call and the person i spoke to before was from philadelphia which is which is actually where i'm from originally so it was kind of cool yeah 

46.45 48.71 A: oh okay that is cool 

49.31 54.20 A: (( okay so let's talk about friends [laughter] do do you have a lot of friends [laughter] )) 

51.23 52.75 B: (( [laughter] okay )) 

53.88 60.01 B: um yeah i would say i mean i i do have a lot of a lot of like acquaintances 

55.83 57.01 A: (( [noise] )) 

59.68 60.72 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

60.21 62.93 B: people i'm friendly with different groups 

62.60 64.19 A: mhm 

63.03 70.24 B: but um but i mean there's definitely like a core group of i would say like ten friends that are like very close 

69.98 73.37 A: okay all right um i'm 

70.88 72.07 B: how about you 

73.40 77.77 A: kinda different i have a lot of acquaintances i even people that i've known for 

77.74 83.87 A: a long time i really don't consider them friends unless i share like a really close bond with them somehow 

80.06 81.20 B: right 

83.45 84.42 B: mhm 

83.79 98.13 A: um i only have a handful of people that i actually consider friends um i think that it's changed as i've gotten older also because i realize that um fr- being in a friendship isn't is you know also big type of relationship 

87.83 88.84 B: mhm 

97.78 98.74 B: right 

98.09 108.25 A: and when you just call everybody your friends i think it's like spreading it a little bit too thin so that's why i like calling um just a a couple of people friends instead of just you know 

102.59 103.57 B: yeah 

108.51 117.39 A: you know instead of just telling everybody oh this is my friend blah blah blah blah blah it's easy to say that this person's my friend but like really how many people truly are so 

112.16 113.28 B: right 

116.34 127.25 B: right you you throw it around a lot [sigh] but i mean i i actually had a friend who was visiting from out of town and we've been friends since college we're both like twenty six 

118.78 120.68 A: yeah 

125.55 126.51 A: mhm 

127.21 133.42 B: and we lived together for a while and we were just saying how like as you start to get a little older it's 

133.47 141.00 B: funny how hard it is to find like really good friends people that like you know like you can count on 

140.83 142.38 A: (( mhm )) 

141.37 142.42 B: um 

142.72 149.26 B: so and it's also it's it's interesting too like the older we get the more we're likely to kind of like 

149.27 155.13 B: cut out the the excess people that really like are not your true friends 

151.92 153.41 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

154.53 161.61 A: exactly exactly what i did mention um i was having this conversation well a similar conversation with one of 

155.42 156.36 B: so 

161.60 164.12 A: i think it was either my cousin or my mom 

164.00 175.30 A: but um i was saying well it's easier to to call people friends when you met so many people when you were at school because you were forced to interact with them on a daily basis so i think that's also where it come 

172.56 173.57 B: right 

175.16 179.83 A: comes from because you know we have a lot of people around us when we're going to school 

179.55 180.54 B: mhm 

179.70 192.09 A: and we're with them so much we might as well call them our friends even when we know that they're not and i think that's also it leads to why there's so many um rumors in high school because we consider everybody our friends but we both know that we 

184.69 185.58 B: right 

191.97 197.52 A: talk about people behind their backs just because [laughter] you know [laughter] they're there we know a bunch about them 

193.55 194.94 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

195.41 196.36 B: right 

197.32 198.32 B: yeah 

197.67 208.92 A: so but when you're older and you you're starting to have families and when you're you know having a career and stuff like that you can't socially interact with other people and i think that's why we've stopped calling people 

208.87 219.36 A: um friends we just know oh this is my work acquaintance this is somebody that i you know there's always some it's somebody that i do this with it's not so much oh this is my friend blah blah blah blah 

209.88 210.90 B: mhm 

219.15 220.19 B: right 

219.93 221.04 A: (( blah so )) 

220.63 226.21 B: it seems the older people get the the smaller their circle of friends is 

225.70 227.48 A: mhm it's true 

226.68 240.28 B: but it it makes sense because you're just focused on different things when you're in college you have so much free time on your hands like [laughter] everybody's your friend you're constantly going out and it it's it's definitely different when you know the older you get 

232.41 233.21 A: mhm 

239.92 246.55 A: i believe and i think that the more outgoing you are the more um you you you tend to call people your friends because 

246.47 260.50 A: you know it's always nice when you go to like certain clubs or bars or restaurants and you're like oh i have a friend that works here or i know this person who comes here regularly and it's nice to just know people because you know who wants to go to a place where they don't know anyone 

254.23 255.18 B: mhm 

260.14 261.13 B: right 

260.52 263.86 A: and a lot of people embrace friends that way also 

263.45 264.52 B: mhm 

264.10 274.96 A: i can't believe i did that i just used the little tiny finger quotations [laughter] when i said that i'm like i'm driving who's going to see this [laughter] 'cause it's [laughter] i'm driving 

267.34 269.39 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

270.23 272.11 B: [laughter] 

272.37 274.09 B: (( you're driving right now )) 

274.71 276.50 B: (( [laughter] that's great )) 

275.08 281.17 A: [laughter] i i'm coming from just coming from one of my oldest friend's houses it's really strange because i've known her since 

281.01 286.09 A: gosh i was like well there's two girls over there one i know i've known since i was five years old 

285.62 286.76 B: wow 

285.91 288.27 A: and the other one since i've known since i was like 

288.04 291.87 A: i would say eleven and we have changed so much over the years 

291.58 292.54 B: mhm 

291.64 303.50 A: and if i would meet them now i swear to god i would hate them i would be like no way i'm not hanging out with them [laughter] but you know when you have a when you have history with somebody it's really hard to to break away from that so 

296.10 297.53 B: i know 

302.04 303.05 B: right 

303.38 318.09 B: i have uh a lot of friends from high school i have a couple of like really close friends and then i have more just acquaintances and everyone like a a lot of them are kind of getting married now and it's it's so strange because i don't really like talk to them on a regular basis 

303.83 304.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

309.36 310.29 A: mhm 

317.45 318.80 A: mhm 

318.20 329.48 B: and we get i'm invited to their weddings and it's it's strange but and it's so true like i wouldn't like if i met them now i really wouldn't have much in common with them like i wouldn't 

329.49 339.72 B: consider really going ahead and forging a friendship with them but because we have so much common history and so many memories together like that just sort of kind of still cements it 

332.37 333.11 A: mhm 

339.67 346.19 A: it does it's like um a feeling of nostalgia i guess because i know i went to a wedding this past um [lipsmack] 

346.39 352.89 A: this summer i guess just passed and it was you know it was a big trip because i had to go to hawaii because my friend see i call her my friend 

352.83 362.72 A: [laughter] because she was getting married let me tell you i have not talked to this girl in the past three years maybe a handful of like four times but 

353.21 354.71 B: [laughter] 

360.53 361.44 B: right 

361.83 362.76 B: mhm 

362.58 373.74 A: when you know i did talk to every day and when i was with her every single day she was such a good person and i you know she was such a good friend to me then i just wanted to continue that even though i know it wasn't going to be the same 

371.36 372.51 B: right 

373.45 374.47 B: yeah 

373.71 383.43 A: so it's you know friends are a good thing you know the ones that you have that you can talk to and stuff it's great it really is so i don't know 

374.84 375.82 B: i know 

380.16 381.09 B: it is 

381.14 382.05 B: it is 

383.24 385.29 B: [sigh] yeah it's um [lipsmack] 

385.56 396.02 B: it's kind of sad too because it it really you really especially when you don't live in the area like all my friends back east i've the majority of them are back east you really have to make an effort 

394.49 397.62 A: (( mhm )) 

396.29 401.80 B: to keep the friendships going 'cause if if you don't like make the call then you know 

398.56 400.27 A: it 

401.86 407.24 B: write them cards on their birthdays and like try and get together at least like a couple of times a year 

408.32 410.64 B: (( it's it's it's pr- it's just not going to last )) 

410.28 414.58 A: it it is and do you find it um how old were you when you moved from um i'm sorry you said 

415.16 424.57 B: well i i lived in pennsylvania grew up there i went to college in new york i lived in new york then for a couple of years and then i moved out like in october to l. a. 

416.21 423.13 A: (( pennsylvania )) 

424.46 425.63 A: oh wow 

424.88 429.32 B: [lipsmack] yeah so i'm a new i'm i'm very you know new out here but 

427.17 436.98 A: and is it do you find it's different like the types of friendships that you have had um in new york and in pennsylvania considering the ones that you have over here 

437.60 438.69 B: um 

438.00 472.69 A: (( mhm )) 

439.54 445.53 B: not so much like i have uh the the a big basis of my friends out here are people i work with 

446.18 455.15 B: because um it's lot of uh work with a lot of like fun people and we all socialize together a lot much more so than any of my other jobs really 

455.60 462.09 B: [lipsmack] um so it's it's definitely different i mean like i said a lot of my friends are you know from 

462.23 466.29 B: not even so much from college but from high school are my close friends 

466.60 469.75 B: so it's di- it's definitely different out here 

470.33 471.64 B: but um 

472.09 486.94 B: but it's not i mean you you ki- tend to find people that are just on the same wavelength i think they're definitely friendships of convenience but like true like people that you really like get along with and enjoy spending time with i i don't think it's different [laughter] 

478.22 490.19 A: mhm okay okay they you know i really like how you put it friendship of convenience because that's 

490.18 494.20 A: what i hate to say it and i might it might make me seem like a shallow person 

494.54 504.04 A: but i know that i have a couple of those and um and it's it's just like it's a give and take thing they su- they give me what i need when i need someone to go shopping with or 

496.94 498.11 B: (( oh ya )) 

503.40 504.45 B: mhm 

503.96 513.80 A: or if i need to do something and they come with me it's like that or if they want me to come with them some place and it's not necessarily like come to my house and ha- 'cause i have nothing to do and we'll just hang out doing nothing 

513.58 525.47 A: it's not like that [laughter] there's always an there's something that has to be done and that's why we hang out so i like how you put that that's a that's a good explanation of one type of friendship because there really are different types 

514.73 516.13 B: right right right 

519.08 520.03 B: yeah 

520.67 522.25 B: mhm [laughter] 

525.92 526.84 B: right 

527.71 542.03 B: [sigh] yeah you know and i i've always been um i've always really tried to like maintain friendships because i see so many people that like that don't and they just like take for granted their friends and then they lose them and i just 

542.34 544.70 B: i don't want that to ever happen to me 

544.98 556.90 A: (( of friendship so that's true )) 

545.60 546.44 B: (( you know )) 

546.56 549.43 B: but you don't you're always going to have friends that are just 

549.48 556.91 B: i mean it's a it's a reciprocal relationship like everyone benefits but it's not like the the bond of certain other relationships 

556.83 563.20 A: it i i find that i have not had a serious like a a bonding friendship like that for quite some time you know 

562.89 564.11 B: it's hard 

563.05 573.09 A: the peop- yeah the people that you meet when you're older it's it's different because you don't you you don't um how can i say you don't grow with them because pretty much you've done all of your 

570.87 571.83 B: mhm 

572.94 582.34 A: all of your growing already with relationships and with your careers and with yourself and um you everybody's pretty much on different levels and um 

578.27 579.29 B: right 

581.29 582.28 B: mhm 

582.37 590.42 A: so that that i guess that common bond is kind of missing you have other things that you can relate to but just that whole growing experience that's a big thing 

590.17 591.17 B: it is 

590.60 599.89 A: that that's really what people get to like really that's how people connect and you know the friends that you that thing you cry over you know your first boyfriend or 

594.99 595.95 B: mhm
