0.43 2.15 A: hi i'm brenda 

1.94 5.46 B: yeah hi brenda i'm wayne how do you do 

4.36 6.16 A: hi wayne fine how are you 

6.13 8.17 B: very good uh 

9.46 12.89 B: as far as eating at a restaurant or home goes uh 

13.19 14.82 B: i'm a cook [laughter] 

14.62 15.42 A: (( ah )) 

15.06 20.18 B: yeah so [cough] uh not not that i don't enjoy 

20.86 22.86 B: eating someone else's food 

22.27 23.25 A: uh-huh 

23.25 25.97 B: but uh i 

26.49 30.35 B: i have greater faith in my own [laughter] yeah 

28.67 31.79 A: [laughter] you know what's in it that way right 

31.14 38.04 B: ah yes yes exactly an- and i guess as a result my my preference is to remain at home 

33.21 34.24 A: uh-huh 

37.45 39.60 A: (( i see well i cook )) 

39.30 40.43 B: yeah 

39.83 44.57 A: and i have two daughters and a husband so i i really have to cook 

44.63 46.24 A: and we 

46.82 52.48 A: mm probably eighty percent of the time we'll eat at home occasionally go out to a restaurant 

53.20 58.70 A: [lipsmack] or uh instead of going out to a restaurant have pizza delivered so i don't have to cook 

58.10 59.47 B: (( yeah )) 

59.81 66.52 B: yeah i've uh uh i've gone that road but it's it's probably rare and and only because 

66.65 68.60 B: not having children 

68.42 69.44 A: uh-huh 

69.45 71.08 B: (( that's [cough] )) 

71.42 73.52 B: one meal 

73.97 78.88 B: uh which i you know i don't know never having children i uh 

78.97 81.77 B: i mean i've never cooked for them 

81.02 82.03 A: uh-huh 

81.82 82.95 B: (( and but )) 

82.23 89.52 A: well it- it's kind of like if you don't cook then everybody sits around and okay what are we going to eat what are we going to eat [laughter] 

86.67 87.50 B: well 

88.07 92.15 B: yeah i expect there would be some of that however 

90.64 91.77 A: uh-huh 

92.48 93.80 B: (( uh )) 

94.42 99.60 B: i don't know why i think it would be any different i suppose it would depend upon the age of the child 

99.16 100.63 A: mhm 

99.86 108.10 B: uh maybe if i had children maybe i'd order out more i don't know i'd probably still cook at home because that's that seems to be what i do 

107.74 112.93 A: right it's less expensive that way also as opposed to going out 

108.39 109.39 B: um 

110.32 116.54 B: oh yeah i mean just the sure just the idea of of having children 

114.19 115.33 A: (( yeah )) 

116.77 121.44 B: and the amount of energy it takes not only to cook for them but 

120.68 121.90 A: uh-huh 

122.09 127.43 B: uh [cough] just to care for them you know is is pretty taxing 

127.07 127.92 A: (( yes )) 

127.49 134.74 B: uh but it's it's just a preference that i have i know an awful lot of men don't don't cook 

134.16 135.81 A: mhm 

135.29 138.67 B: and there are some women who don't cook 

138.06 139.71 A: right that's true 

138.69 144.40 B: [laughter] so i guess they have to rely upon someone else to do it and uh 

143.00 144.25 A: uh-huh 

145.20 149.95 B: as a child i wanted to cook my father was a cook so 

149.28 150.13 A: huh 

150.68 156.89 B: you know as a youngster i wanted to emulate him and hung around the kitchen and the first thing he taught me was 

152.97 154.13 A: mhm 

156.92 158.37 B: clean up 

157.97 161.37 A: [laughter] you have to know that if you're going to cook 

160.65 164.52 B: absolutely that was the first lesson he taught me and 

161.61 162.50 A: (( yep )) 

163.44 170.36 A: unless you have someone else that will do it for you which is not real likely [laughter] 

166.42 167.23 B: i 

167.78 172.10 B: [laughter] no not in my circumstances i 

170.87 172.19 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

172.22 178.35 B: don't don't happen to have that luxury so to me cleaning up is part of the cooking process 

177.26 179.36 A: exactly right 

178.59 186.35 B: and it goes along with it it's it's one of the things i guess that distinguishes eating out from doing it at home is if someone else 

185.10 186.63 A: mhm 

187.62 190.52 B: has the burden of doing all the cleaning 

190.14 191.48 A: yeah 

190.72 196.41 B: but uh to me cleaning and cooking are simultaneous they you know they 

194.83 198.26 A: mhm yeah both have to happen 

198.33 199.63 B: yeah they do 

198.43 201.13 A: or if one happens you have to do the other 

201.00 204.55 B: yah and then there's the issue of of um 

205.11 207.43 B: i guess all of us have probably seen 

207.57 208.49 B: uh 

208.71 212.37 B: things on television if nothing else where 

212.41 215.91 B: people go to restaurants and they discover [laughter] 

216.28 219.80 B: things that are that you wouldn't want in your own kitchen 

217.59 218.23 A: (( hm )) 

219.26 220.54 A: yes 

220.45 225.03 B: and there is i think a health issue which is also uh 

226.32 233.50 B: uh not a primary [sigh] motivation but probably a secondary motivation for cooking at home 

226.37 227.25 A: (( yeah i )) 

231.41 238.61 A: right something that's always in the back of your mind because you don't know how clean the place is and 

236.51 241.94 B: absolutely brenda i i i mean i don't know right right i don't have a clue 

239.40 240.67 A: right 

241.41 242.61 A: uh-huh 

242.13 245.74 B: and we've seen these stories too uh [cough] 

246.17 252.10 B: where uh people who are employed by restaurants as acts of either 

252.31 258.05 B: well it's malice uh it may not be directed toward you specifically but you could be the 

253.60 254.80 A: mhm 

258.07 259.67 B: the recipient 

259.87 263.86 B: of their particular anger or their jokes or their 

264.35 266.50 B: just plain nastiness 

266.26 267.82 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

267.04 270.63 B: and you don't really [laughter] know what's in that salad i mean 

269.90 274.04 A: right yeah that's scary you don't know what you're going to be eating 

271.02 271.98 B: so 

272.59 273.28 B: yeah 

273.55 282.07 B: that is correct i don't know and not that i know everything that i buy say at farmers market or the grocery store to cook at home but 

282.45 286.35 B: at least i can wash it and clean it and know 

285.64 289.54 A: the best that yeah best that you can get everything off 

287.87 291.86 B: ah right as best sure sure as much 

290.08 297.57 A: yeah i feel a lot of people nowadays also more people probably eat out because of the husband and wife both working 

297.19 299.03 B: this is exactly right 

298.41 307.58 A: you know and and if i was the working a working wife i wouldn't want to come home and cook and clean up y- you're just too tired and 

304.58 305.50 B: well 

305.64 306.43 B: that 

307.02 315.90 B: i i was a working husband and still did all the cooking my my wife is not a cook 

312.06 313.60 A: (( mhm )) 

315.22 316.67 A: (( mhm )) 

316.04 322.48 B: but i can assure you uh that after working twelve hour days which is what i used to do 

320.26 321.19 A: (( mm )) 

321.82 323.49 A: mhm 

322.78 325.69 B: i wasn't as anxious to cook 

324.47 327.38 A: no [laughter] i would think not 

326.71 329.58 B: coming home at six o'clock in the evening 

328.48 330.95 A: right yeah 

329.99 332.34 B: um as 

332.90 335.78 B: i was when i you know on my days off 

335.15 337.69 A: mhm exactly 

336.24 337.16 B: so 

337.45 348.00 B: and you know there are still women out there who uh because historically i think women have been relegated more into the kitchen 

348.16 349.80 B: men who 

349.94 354.99 B: think that a woman's job is often more of a hobby [laughter] 

354.20 355.93 A: mhm 

355.02 364.31 B: and they think oh well she can come home and cook for me and one or two children and because she doesn't really have a job you know and 

360.23 361.08 A: (( [laughter] )) 

362.97 365.45 A: mhm right 

364.85 372.35 B: um this this attitude while i don't think it's as uh pervasive as it used to be is still pretty 

370.63 371.80 A: mhm 

372.65 376.57 A: yeah not as much as it used to be but it's still there yep 

374.76 378.14 B: it's still out there that's right that's right because i 

378.57 385.22 B: i know when i do go to the grocery store to shop uh uh i find that uh i don't talk to women 

385.43 386.67 B: or men 

386.85 391.85 B: unless they look particularly keen under the age of forty because they don't know anything 

389.72 390.87 A: mhm 

391.22 393.35 A: [laughter] 

392.32 396.81 B: and if i see a women who is say seventy or eighty 

396.41 397.37 A: uh-huh 

397.43 399.69 B: that's where i get my advice 

399.26 400.69 A: mhm 

400.10 401.25 B: on 

401.26 402.93 B: things to [cough] 

403.54 408.71 B: look for and things to do so i can take the food home and maybe do a little bit better job on it 

407.64 419.16 A: right yeah yeah the young young ones don't they just get the the fast food or the easy microwave or in the oven type foods something quick and easy 

409.16 410.01 B: but 

414.04 414.60 B: (( [cough] )) 

418.72 423.35 B: well this this is another thing with which you have experience and i don't 

423.52 425.08 A: (( mm yes )) 

424.25 429.78 B: if i had children you know it's it's very easy for people who don't have children 

429.40 430.77 A: yeah 

430.16 436.07 B: to say oh well i would blah blah blah blah blah well you don't have a clue i mean 

433.60 434.88 A: (( mhm )) 

435.51 436.95 A: [laughter] 

436.09 437.65 B: [laughter] pe- 

437.01 440.03 A: (( it's a different world [laughter] )) 

438.42 444.01 B: it is a totally different world and people like me who don't have them don't really know 

440.05 440.98 A: yeah 

443.69 444.77 A: yeah 

444.17 449.67 B: what i would do if i had to you know say for example two children coming home in an hour 

449.19 450.36 A: mhm 

450.80 454.50 A: actually i had one just come home [laughter] 

452.61 458.87 B: yeah and y- and they are hungry i mean i- if they are nothing else if they're awake 

455.29 456.20 A: (( yeah )) 

457.61 458.43 A: (( uh )) 

458.95 461.27 A: they're hungry exactly 

459.17 460.43 B: (( they're hungry )) 

460.68 472.07 B: and you've got to prepare your food unless you happen to have a a great deal of money and e- you know even though their preference may be for eating out my god 

467.61 468.90 A: mhm 

469.93 476.48 A: r- oh yeah but they don't pay for it so that's not how it happens [laughter] usually 

473.13 474.80 B: well not only 

476.01 481.18 B: that's true they may not pay for it economically but they may pay for it in other ways 

480.42 482.19 A: yes that's true 

481.77 486.90 B: because of the you know the amount of yeah the weight gain the 

483.11 485.10 A: weight gain for one 

486.18 487.73 A: mhm 

487.14 491.62 B: the quality of the food when you eat out to me is not 

491.88 494.08 B: in some places for sure 

493.57 495.00 A: mhm 

494.40 498.58 B: uh is not as nutritious nor as good as 

498.72 500.93 B: and i think once a child develops 

501.30 508.33 B: certain habits and again i'm an expert on raising children having raised none of them [laughter] uh 

505.19 507.31 A: [laughter] 

509.10 514.41 B: that you know that that it can't be healthy some of that stuff 

513.79 515.76 A: right exactly 

514.53 519.79 B: so yeah and at at least at home as a parent 

520.95 525.07 B: you would have a certain amount of control and possibly 

525.57 527.60 B: teach them to develop 

527.65 530.78 B: better safer healthier eating habits 

530.25 531.46 A: mhm 

531.08 534.75 B: than say going to a place that is uh 

535.28 536.75 B: not as healthy 

536.13 538.30 A: right i hope i'm doing that 

538.22 542.71 B: well yeah it's it's not as if parents don't have enough responsibility 

538.67 540.05 A: i think 

542.07 544.21 A: yeah [laughter] yeah 

543.23 549.00 B: i mean you know but i- it's it's difficult and and it 

549.15 552.15 B: it places a greater burden i guess on the 

550.82 560.45 A: mhm that's funny that cooking is the topic now because i have no power i have no electricity so i don't know what we're having for dinner tonight [laughter] 

559.69 564.59 B: uh without electricity that can be a real problem i'm very fortunate 

561.36 563.66 A: yeah and my 

564.69 567.68 B: in that i ha- i uh cook with gas 

567.05 570.14 A: ah my whole house is electric so 

569.19 578.60 B: yeah and even if if my you know if my electricity did go off you you know which it does if there's a storm or something sometime 

575.03 575.96 A: yes 

575.99 581.46 A: mhm right that's what happened here you'd still be set you could still eat 

580.44 585.47 B: i can still cook at home because of the fact i have gas 

581.63 582.88 A: (( uh-huh )) 

585.93 589.74 B: and um at least i can boil water [laughter] 

588.97 590.93 A: [laughter] 

589.81 591.22 B: and uh 

591.33 593.28 A: you could have soup that way 

593.53 594.79 B: well i 

594.84 599.52 B: i also trust gas more than i do electricity i think it's f-
