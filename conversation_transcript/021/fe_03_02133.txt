272.96 274.32 B: yeah 

273.70 286.16 A: it was a gradual thing it's like i basically i had to cut one thing out at a time you know i couldn't just go cold turkey it's like i started with just cutting out cold cuts and then gradually made my way up to steak and chicken 

286.39 289.66 B: oh is that right sort of like quitting smoking 

287.37 288.65 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah ))

298.95 301.04 B: (( and cheese you know eat that [noise] )) 

300.48 314.03 A: yeah that's the problem it's like you wind up eating stuff that's not always so good for you like cheese like eating a lot of it but [lipsmack] it it's fine i mean living here in new york there's so many options and like i said there's so many restaurants that cater to it 

308.35 309.29 B: yeah 

312.76 313.66 B: right 

313.95 315.80 A: so it works out okay

446.41 451.87 A: yeah [sigh] wow did you have cravings afterwards or did it pretty much dissipate 

451.83 455.74 B: well i had cravings yeah in fact i would think about 

455.14 456.52 A: yeah 

456.21 464.60 B: it and i'd crave 'em but it would go away it wasn't too bad because i leveled out over a period of six or seven months 

463.97 465.15 A: mhm 

465.44 470.58 B: so when i finally broke off i didn't have as much nicotine built up in my system 

469.86 471.21 A: mhm 

471.11 474.03 B: [sigh] which is a very powerful drug 

473.64 475.55 A: it is definitely 

474.61 477.75 B: why they allow that to be legal i don't know 

477.16 480.43 A: i know that what kills me it's so argh and i 

479.66 482.27 B: but they're cracking down on it 

481.57 487.06 A: they sure are they just outlawed it here in new york all the bars you can't smoke in the bars anymore 

487.42 494.00 B: well they um most restaurants you ah well the ah most restau- restaurants they have two sections 

493.39 494.44 A: mhm 

494.13 496.21 B: smoking and non smoking 

495.66 496.76 A: right 

497.16 499.64 B: we don't go to bars of course but 

499.28 501.43 A: yeah it's for the ba- 

500.34 506.90 B: some have a bar attached and if people are smoking at the bar and then it drifts into the restaurant 

503.92 505.02 A: mhm 

506.29 516.45 A: yeah exactly it kinda makes it moot even separating it [noise] it's kinda like when they used to have smoking and non smoking on a plane it's like what's the point [laughter] have one little barrier up 

509.55 510.68 B: right 

515.05 518.72 B: boy that plane travel is dangerous these days 

518.26 519.48 A: [lipsmack] what's that 

519.49 521.19 B: (( with sars )) 

520.89 523.89 A: oh yeah it's crazy it's like the plague 

522.85 527.42 B: that's all you know [noise] a- they don't take s- air in from outside you know [noise] 

526.84 527.92 A: (( mm )) 

528.43 536.76 A: it's just so ah it seems like every day on the news it's something worse when it come- it's just a creepy kinda thing anyone who went to asia i feel sorry for 

538.75 542.48 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah well um it it's dangerous the whole thing 

541.91 543.40 A: absolutely 

542.80 544.76 B: and it's hurting the economy 

544.56 548.61 A: [sigh] yeah that too i mean everything's just kinda weird right now 

547.09 553.41 B: air bonds are going down travel's going down because the people aren't staying in the hotels going travelling 

549.79 550.82 A: (( i know at least at )) 

553.04 557.51 A: least you can get cheaper plane tickets [laughter] that's the only positive thing to come out of it 

555.02 556.35 B: [laughter] 

557.32 559.27 B: right [noise] 

557.77 561.22 A: [laughter] but yeah everything else not too good 

560.91 566.84 B: we can get a round trip from indianapolis to los angles for a hundred and fifteen dollars a piece 

566.33 568.79 A: wow that's pretty sweet 

568.44 572.11 B: from indianapolis we have to travel up to indianapolis though

577.01 577.96 B: no 

577.70 578.71 A: yeah 

578.10 581.19 B: we would much rather stay around here [sigh] 

581.22 586.06 B: and just go to restaurants and stay in hotels around here and do what we want to do 

582.85 583.91 A: mhm 

585.69 587.59 A: (( i hear you [laughter] )) 

586.93 590.03 B: you don't have to go to some foreign city to enjoy it [noise] 

591.71 597.25 A: exactly and then it gets old pretty quickly you know especially with everything going on right now 

596.98 598.25 B: (( [noise] yeah [sigh] ))
