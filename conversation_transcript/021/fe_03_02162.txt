106.90 110.57 B: wow that's quite a load okay let me see um 

110.53 122.88 B: i eat out a lot because in new york city there are something like thirty thousand restaurants so between eating out and ordering in i'm um always eating restaurant food um 

115.46 116.68 A: wow 

123.00 133.39 B: you know in my mind i'd like to i say i'd like to have home cooked meals and all that kind of stuff but um in actuality i really uh 

133.37 144.66 B: don't want to be bothered with the going for the groceries and you know the cooking and the clean up afterwards you know you eat out you order in it's so much easier you just throw it i- throw the plates away you know 

139.24 140.21 A: really 

144.10 154.33 A: yeah but it costs so much money to eat out and that's where it's at with us is you know i i'm on a fixed income uh you know it i make a decent salary but 

146.55 147.85 B: (( yeah right )) 

150.78 151.79 B: right 

153.74 154.68 B: uh-huh 

154.38 158.44 A: the nine hundred mortgage for the house and whatnot just kind of bites in 

158.09 159.87 B: yeah sure sure 

159.31 168.61 A: you know uh so on and so forth you know i only make under well under twenty thousand a year is wh- what i make and uh you know 

164.48 165.43 B: uh-huh 

166.05 166.91 B: uh-huh 

168.55 175.74 A: eating out it it you end up spending over well with my family you end up spending over twenty dollars every time if you eat 

174.79 176.60 B: you're right right 

175.71 181.74 A: if you eat as cheap as you can you're eating at burger king or something nasty like that you know i 

179.55 181.84 B: that's right that's right 

181.72 193.38 A: i do uh on on wednesdays i usually do uh a eat out thing but we we order in like we uh just order it we've got a oriental restaurant that delivers here and 

188.22 189.09 B: uh-huh 

192.86 193.84 B: uh-huh 

193.69 197.88 A: a few other places deliver and we just eat in on wednesdays 

197.54 201.75 B: now are you in the city or i- is ogden a city or is it more suburban 

201.39 206.55 A: it's a city outright my neighbors are twenty feet from me i- if that 

204.53 205.86 B: oh okay 

206.02 215.25 B: okay well i mean one of the things about having so many restaurants is that you know yeah i do a lot of cheap chinese 'cause you're right it is expensive 

215.15 229.61 B: um but there's a such a um a wealth of um you know places that they can't afford to make their pr- prices go too high because there's you know a hundred other places that will will undercut them with prices you know 

229.18 242.15 A: and see out here the olympics uh jacked up prices for everything it made it impossible for low income m- and whatnot people to be able to afford to go out and enjoy a nice meal in a nice restaurant you know it's twenty 

242.12 245.20 A: twenty to thirty dollars a plate to go a nice place 

244.58 247.75 B: wow yeah yeah that is quite 

245.76 256.63 A: you know and that that it's not i can't you know it's not worth it and there again like i said you know other than that you end up at burger king or mcdonalds or nasty food 

250.27 251.30 B: right 

256.11 260.97 B: right right the only thing about um restaurant food is that 

256.97 257.96 A: (( you know [sigh] )) 

260.96 275.03 B: even though it might be good it's not exactly wh- the way i like it you know when you cook you can make it the exactly like if you like it spicy or hot or not too spicy or whatever then you can make it exactly the way you want it 

265.46 266.88 A: right 

267.28 268.87 A: exactly 

271.38 273.48 A: and uh you know it 

274.30 287.49 A: in the beginning i i thought i wanted to be a cook and i moved down to las vegas where my mom lives and uh started cooking institutionally and i tasted what i was cooking and found that i couldn't make it taste good 

279.46 280.36 B: uh-huh 

282.04 282.98 B: uh-huh 

287.48 289.33 B: oh that was in the beginning 

288.27 290.12 A: i wasn't allowed to 

290.16 292.01 A: it's against the law 

291.80 293.85 B: (( o- oh really what do you mean )) 

292.84 296.65 A: people are a- people are allergic to things like salt pepper 

295.66 297.63 B: oh right 

296.71 305.13 A: uh other spices you know that you naturally add in your food at home so i decided to back out of that real quick 

298.27 299.37 B: right 

300.93 303.73 B: right so you had to make it kind of bland 

304.53 306.88 B: yeah did it make it kind of bland
