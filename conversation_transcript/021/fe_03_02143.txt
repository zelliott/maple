15.33 16.36 A: uh-huh 

16.18 21.54 B: um i love to cook but i i can't do it seven days a week [laughter] 

18.74 19.60 A: (( [noise] do you )) 

20.89 23.21 A: i hate to cook i live in pennsylvania 

23.45 25.44 A: my husband does most of the cooking 

25.66 27.35 B: what kind of food do you like 

26.66 28.04 A: [sigh] ah [cough] 

28.32 40.47 A: i like to go out because you don't have the mess to clean up [sigh] and it's not really i guess that i don't like cooking it's that i don't know a lot of how to because my mother always gave us frozen entrees [noise] 

40.09 41.19 B: oh really 

40.60 45.16 A: so [noise] i'm ah [sigh] probably an experimental cooker i guess you could say 

44.86 46.06 B: oh that's good 

45.55 49.19 A: [cough] and they eat anything just [noise] about except fish 

49.72 51.09 B: your family [noise] 

50.43 54.58 A: yes [noise] two kids and my husband and myself how about you [noise] [noise] 

54.24 58.34 B: um i'm a vegan so i don't eat any meat or anything that comes from animal 

57.74 61.33 A: [noise] so isn't it hard to [noise] prepare things 

59.87 60.68 B: it's 

60.85 64.21 B: kind of it forced experimental like yourself 

61.52 62.29 A: (( [cough] )) 

62.49 63.34 A: (( [noise] )) 

63.71 65.58 A: especially if you're going out 

65.29 73.77 B: [mn] well there's actually a lot of places to choose from in new york that cater to vegetarian and vegans and like healthy lifestyles so it is actually fairly easy to eat out 

69.72 70.97 A: oh 

73.15 75.76 A: what's the difference between that and vegetarian 

75.65 81.36 B: just no animal products no dairy no cheese no milk no butter mhm 

75.90 76.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

78.21 80.53 A: so no butter or anything [noise] 

80.58 81.50 A: (( [mn] well )) 

82.30 84.29 A: for milk then [noise] what do you do 

84.54 97.38 B: [mn] i don't drink it either that or i use soy milk it comes from beans and [sigh] it's just as good um so i enjoy eating out because the places that are really [noise] healthy create these amazing creative dishes 

87.04 88.18 A: okay [noise] [sigh] 

96.80 98.17 A: oh 

97.77 102.81 B: that ah introduce y- like my mouth to new flavors beside your meat and potato [noise] type dishes 

102.21 103.63 A: (( right [mn] )) 

102.94 108.99 B: so when i go out and eat because i like cooking then i'll go [noise] home and try to cook it and make it better [noise] 

108.44 110.72 A: oh okay 

110.77 113.45 A: [sigh] [mn] plus when you eat at home you save more money 

113.22 114.45 B: that's true [noise] 

113.78 115.36 A: than going out [laughter] 

114.85 116.09 B: [laughter] 

115.37 119.25 A: especially nowadays everything seems to be on a tight budget for everybody 

118.82 120.01 B: mhm 

120.63 126.22 A: [noise] [lipsmack] is there a lot of areas to eat in your [sigh] where you live do you live right in the city into 

125.78 140.60 B: i live in brooklyn so it's a couple of stops [noise] but brooklyn is actually the biggest borough so we have a lot of selection as far as restaurants go from you know your cheap fast food to inexpensive lunches to fifty dollar steaks 

128.28 129.86 A: (( the city mhm )) 

137.62 138.35 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] )) 

140.17 141.41 A: oh 

140.64 146.27 B: so whatever you want you can find it here and it's pretty much all deliverable until four in the morning 

145.76 146.83 A: wow 

146.49 155.48 B: [mn] so if you are a night owl or you work strange hours or just have cravings first thing in the morning or late at night after a night of drinking you can 

151.64 152.53 A: (( right )) 

155.56 157.51 B: eat whatever you want you know 

156.56 164.01 A: [noise] and see round here [sigh] everything closes by nine or ten so if you're travelling through and you're hungry you're out of luck 

162.82 163.47 B: (( [noise] )) 

163.82 165.51 B: [laughter] that's no good 

164.83 165.84 A: no 

165.54 171.58 B: [sigh] that's why it's always hard to leave new york because i crave those staples that i'm used to having all the time you know 

169.74 171.06 A: (( [noise] right [sigh] )) 

171.38 172.34 A: (( right )) 

172.64 174.36 A: (( [mn] gee [sigh] )) 

173.82 183.99 B: yeah my parents [noise] live in the mid west so every time i go there i it's all family or it's all um [lipsmack] what are they called ah like chili's and applebee's and 

183.20 184.65 A: (( right [sigh] )) 

184.05 194.59 B: those types of places where here i like to support the independent stores and the boutiques the people that it's a family owned business you know you are actually getting like roman italian food 

187.70 189.17 A: oh yeah [sigh] 

190.72 192.25 A: right 

192.37 192.96 A: (( [sigh] )) 

193.95 195.60 A: exactly [noise] 

194.75 197.31 B: and they are going to make it good because 

197.35 203.54 B: that's their business they have to do this well to survive or they're not going to survive and they'll have to go back to their own country or whatever so 

198.18 199.26 A: mhm 

201.86 205.07 A: that's right right [noise] i agree 

204.01 205.60 B: i like the diversity 

205.40 208.39 A: i agree [sigh] how about pasta do you eat that 

208.12 211.24 B: [mn] rarely it's funny because my room mate last night was 

211.02 223.69 B: commenting about the healthy way that i eat she's like you eat pretty much anything but pasta and i'm like well it doesn't really do much for me but every once in a while i really like a good bowl of pasta with some eggplant homemade tomato sauce 

215.92 217.66 A: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

219.89 221.34 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

223.53 226.95 B: but just like the spaghetti maybe like once a month [noise] 

224.93 228.31 A: that's a lot of work [noise] homemade sauce [sigh] 

227.65 228.86 B: mhm 

229.59 230.20 A: (( [noise] )) 

229.80 234.22 B: but i like to do that and then you know you make a big bowl and then you can eat it a couple of times that week 

233.04 234.90 A: (( [noise] right )) 

234.33 236.98 B: but it's difficult to cook all the time and work 

236.49 237.96 A: it is [sigh] [sigh] 

237.30 241.85 B: so now i'm working at home and freelancing i have time to actually cook two or three meals a day 

240.23 242.84 A: ah that's nice yeah 

243.09 245.44 B: [mn] so it makes a big difference i can feel 

243.17 244.16 A: great 

246.00 248.50 B: m- i feel more energized 

247.83 249.15 A: yeah 

248.55 254.21 B: you know and i get kinda bummed out if i go out and spend like ten dollars on lunch and it sucks 

253.08 256.36 A: [noise] [sigh] yeah you could have s- saved it [noise] 

254.91 257.35 B: and you did it because of convenience you know [noise] 

256.60 264.64 A: yeah that's true that that's probably [sigh] we're on the go a lot so that's why [noise] sometimes we feel like we 

264.50 277.80 A: [mn] are living in the car run to soccer run to dancing run to cheering run to [noise] music lessons [sigh] we're running every day of the week except sunday [sigh] so [noise] sometimes we can't avoid going we have [noise] to go out you know unless i 

269.99 270.93 B: sure 

272.71 273.64 B: mhm 

277.74 289.18 A: [sigh] which i do sometimes put something in the car you know throw together [sigh] vegetables in a bag or fruit in a bag and here f- f- just until after your soccer game and then you know we'll go home and eat [mn] 

289.60 292.39 A: [laughter] [sigh] yeah 

289.64 290.27 B: (( [laughter] )) 

290.86 296.29 B: it's true like even like we're so busy my boyfriend and i that sometimes we only eat two meals a day 

296.58 297.94 B: [sigh] because by the time 

296.67 299.69 A: you just don't have time for that third one right [noise] 

298.00 304.37 B: exactly it's like right now we're getting ready to go into the city and then we'll go out tonight and we won't get home until probably two in the morning 

303.78 305.39 A: mhm 

304.83 308.07 B: so we'll eat now and maybe have a snack later and that's it 

307.41 309.87 A: [sigh] yeah you're forced to sometimes 

308.31 308.87 B: (( [cough] )) 

310.34 312.21 B: [sigh] but it's yeah 

311.80 315.33 A: [mn] but it's nice to work from home like you said then you have it right there 

315.23 316.71 B: you have no excuse 

316.12 317.54 A: (( right )) 

316.96 318.42 B: [laughter] 

317.66 319.32 A: (( [laughter] [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

319.72 321.89 B: so i wonder what else they want us to talk about 

321.08 322.15 A: i don't know 

322.28 323.26 B: [laughter] 

322.65 324.86 A: how how many minutes did we use up 

324.70 328.78 B: um let me see two six or seven so far [noise] 

327.78 328.54 A: oh 

329.27 331.64 A: and then do they get back on [noise] 

331.27 334.85 B: yeah they'll tell us at like the eight minute mark that we've talked enough 

334.39 335.37 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

335.28 337.28 B: what kind of restaurants do you like 

336.70 343.82 A: [noise] [mn] um [sigh] ones that aren't really expensive like we don't do the sixty dollar steak definitely ever 

342.38 343.43 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

343.83 344.93 A: [sigh] um 

345.31 360.31 A: probably middle of the line you know not n- not a greasy place but i i like like you said independent people that [sigh] are trying to make a go of it and trying to make it a family business and [sigh] keep customers coming back that type of thing 

360.73 365.97 A: [mn] we do have all those applebee all those garden chili places around here but we don't go to them 

360.76 361.66 B: (( do you f- )) 

364.63 365.53 B: mhm 

366.64 368.48 A: [sigh] um i'm not saying i 

367.48 375.13 B: that's good because i feel like if you support those places then eventually all we are going to have is like chili's and starbucks and applebee's and nothing else 

371.78 373.03 A: is that 

373.37 377.78 A: [noise] that's right i i [noise] i think so too [sigh] 

377.00 386.85 B: it's a little upsetting because a lot of those places are starting to pop up in new york we just like a t- another t. g. i. f. you know the fiftieth starbucks and it's like do we really need that 

383.18 384.71 A: (( [sigh] )) 

386.03 390.46 A: do we need that that's the other thing i think too [noise] [sigh] sooner or later 

389.90 390.62 B: (( [noise] )) 

390.46 405.15 A: i just feel there's nothing going to be left except houses in america and [sigh] we always have to trade oil and food and this and that w- what about farming in our own [noise] country every farm that is around here where i live [sigh] has almost been sold to a developer [sigh] and 

404.93 414.71 A: maybe they only grew corn or maybe they only grew wheat or maybe they only grew i don't know grapes apples whatever [sigh] but [sigh] now where are we getting the stuff that they used to grow 

414.43 415.44 B: mhm 

414.76 421.17 A: and if we just keep turning all of our land into condos [sigh] i i think people should have to buy 

420.71 423.05 B: we're not going to be self sufficient anymore 

421.44 426.45 A: no we're not we're not and and i really fell that we aren't [sigh] because 

426.58 433.38 A: nothing [mn] hardly is american made nothing is i'm not saying nothing is american grown there still are a lot of farmers but [sigh] [mn] 

432.67 433.81 B: mhm 

433.79 434.66 A: we 

434.48 439.39 A: we live in a city so we live in a row home and that's like an apartment or a townhouse [noise] 

439.15 448.22 A: probably similar to [noise] new york city you know it's a [noise] smaller city but [sigh] it's a high crime area so we get away on the weekends we have a trailer and it's in the mountains [noise] [sigh] 

448.11 463.09 A: and i love going there because every single weekend [noise] we get to go the farmers' market and get the freshest [sigh] [noise] tomatoes and the freshest apples and and [noise] it's [noise] all grown on their farm [noise] and the taste is just so much better 

463.05 463.61 A: (( [mn] )) 

463.90 472.38 B: no i totally agree we have farmers' markets here and i try to support those [noise] or the people p- pushing the carts with the fruit on the corners [sigh] versus going to the supermarket 

468.85 469.86 A: mhm 

471.34 481.13 A: yeah i mean sometimes you have to go to the supermarket but [sigh] i just [noise] taste i don't know maybe it's just [noise] me i taste the difference in the product [noise] i do i [noise] 

479.37 480.29 B: mhm 

481.35 486.42 A: i just think their apples are so much crispier and and juicer and i don't know 

484.20 485.14 B: sure 

485.52 487.28 B: they're not waxed and 

486.59 498.34 A: we don't know where they're coming from when they're in the grocery store i know where they're coming from when i buy it from the farmers' market i know it's fresh i know that that money is going to them and not [sigh] who knows who 

487.81 489.50 B: sprayed with preservatives 

493.33 494.32 B: mhm 

498.19 499.07 B: right 

499.17 509.24 B: [sigh] no i agree with you and sometimes like now that men are making animals and crossbreeding different kinds [noise] of fruit and making them without growing them on trees anymore [mn] 

500.20 501.64 A: (( yeah [sigh] [noise] )) 

508.31 509.66 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

509.39 519.30 B: they're not the f._d._a. does not require them to put any kinds of stickers f- fruit and produce like that so you don't even know where your produce is coming from when you buy it at the grocery store 

513.44 515.72 A: oh i didn't know that 

518.85 520.51 A: i didn't know that [sigh] 

519.67 522.77 B: sometimes if i see like really large grapefruits 

522.22 523.41 A: yeah 

522.83 529.74 B: i'm like this isn't possible this is not physically or humanly [laughter] possible where did this thing come from but you just don't know uh-uh 

529.13 539.53 A: yeah [mn] we have an orchard that's about seven miles away [sigh] and their apples are really really expensive but they're the biggest apples that you ever saw and [sigh] 

539.59 542.67 A: the place if you've ever heard of mrs prindable's 

542.75 553.67 A: apples they're chocolate dipped they're like twenty one dollars for one apple and i said who would pay twenty one dollars for one apple well did you ever have one of her apples i said no i'm diabetic i really shouldn't have chocolate 

553.12 554.32 B: (( [laughter] )) 

553.54 562.64 A: taste one of their apples without it [mn] it was the best apple i ever had and that i found out because [noise] i researched it that it comes from right here nine 

558.08 559.08 B: wow 

562.57 574.05 A: nine miles away at the orchard and i don't know how they get their apples that big but [sigh] they had it gated in so people aren't going to [noise] the orchard at night to pick apples [noise] you know it's gated in and 

573.93 581.17 A: the trees have been there forever and you can [noise] see the apples growing and [sigh] not as big as a grapefruit but bigger than a regular apple 

580.61 581.69 B: mhm 

581.06 590.50 A: and just really a good taste so whenever we can [noise] a- afford that luxury we'll go get apples from there [sigh] [sigh] yeah they're really a good apple 

587.22 588.46 B: oh that's neat 

591.51 592.57 B: wow 

592.17 595.67 A: [mn] but other than that i see to think thank most of the farms are 

595.98 599.89 A: [noise] i don't know about your area or if you ever drive through you know fields
