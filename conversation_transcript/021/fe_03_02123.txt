117.07 118.06 B: mhm 

118.30 125.01 B: [noise] exactly and sometimes people we've met m- more recently might seem like good friends and then all of a sudden 

125.08 126.11 B: they 

126.24 133.84 B: change on you and they're not o- okay actually one of the questions was like do you have many friends or a few and i guess i 

133.92 135.64 B: i'd say more 

135.71 150.40 B: a few really good friends and some acquaintances and some frien- friends at you know different varying levels but the closest friends i can't say i have a whole lot of close friends [laughter] because ah i don't think that would work too well [laughter] 

143.82 144.77 A: mhm 

146.28 147.74 A: right right 

150.20 156.67 A: you know that's what they say though is like if you find a true your true closest friend is like a diamond never let them go 

156.20 157.44 B: mhm 

156.82 163.64 A: you know there's that an- and nothing can destroy it you know pretty much nothing that can destroy that kind of friendship it's so strong 

163.37 164.74 B: right right 

164.32 177.93 A: yeah yeah i know what you mean with like the superficialness of some friendships it's like they come and go and you they you know they think that you did something that they don't care about and then suddenly they don't return your phone calls and 

168.51 169.84 B: mhm 

177.16 178.39 B: mhm 

178.01 179.41 A: yeah [laughter] 

178.99 191.24 B: or yeah some of those are mo- some of those friends like you call them and they just don't call back you call they don't call back and not that you did anything wrong and it's like what kind of a friend is this what do i need this friend for 

184.74 185.59 A: yep 

185.73 186.60 A: yep 

191.08 192.02 A: right 

191.38 194.44 B: um wh- and why am i always the one who's doing the calling 

194.11 194.97 A: right 

194.56 198.93 B: [laughter] that's what i also find with some of those friends but um 

195.72 197.39 A: right right 

199.29 205.18 B: one of my closet friends from long ago um always calls me on my birthday 

205.23 206.13 A: oh 

205.41 208.74 B: so i'm i'm she lives she lives in portland oregon so 

208.58 209.86 A: oh okay [noise] 

208.75 211.10 B: i know i'll always hear from her then 

211.18 220.17 B: so we call a couple of times during the year but i know that i can count on her and her birthday is right behind mine it's ap- mine's april third hers is april sixth 

211.21 213.91 A: aw that's nice once a year [laughter] 

219.91 225.59 A: so she knows that you know she does- she'll never forget because she knows [laughter] [laughter] 

222.93 223.83 B: right 

224.09 231.07 B: and then turning fifty was a big turning point [laughter] so you know we had lots to talk about when that came about 

227.19 229.73 A: oh sure definitely 

230.80 232.78 A: [noise] a lot of reflection 

231.10 232.99 B: but um 

233.13 236.26 B: it can be so so far away and yet 

236.48 238.38 B: yeah it really is 

238.07 239.16 A: that's neat 

238.49 245.51 B: a very comfortable and secure feeling to speak to an old friend you know you can trust an old friend 

245.41 246.81 A: right right 

246.00 248.69 B: whereas some of these newer ones it's like 

249.00 253.08 B: what happened there or why haven't i heard from her or what's going on now 

251.81 252.69 A: right 

252.93 265.19 A: i actually i um had watched this oprah i don't know if you have ever heard of her ah watched her before but she had this thing on toxic friendships and how like some friendships will just suck the life out of you 

253.10 254.06 B: and 

256.39 257.39 B: mhm 

260.91 262.12 B: mhm 

264.67 265.96 B: mhm 

265.54 268.62 A: and that you know you need to like cut those away from your life 

267.98 276.66 B: right you have to step back and say come on this is not good for me [laughter] this is not working i've had to do that with some people just have to step back and say [mn] 

271.57 273.33 A: right right 

277.39 288.94 B: i can't divulge everything i'm getting too close and it's not serving me well and um i know to be careful with this person from now on i wish i didn't have to be 

280.91 282.01 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

287.36 288.18 A: right 

288.56 289.87 A: right right 

289.55 293.38 B: i wish i could totally trust as i trust my other friends 

291.20 292.06 A: trust 

293.32 307.87 B: but it's just not turning out the same way unfortunately got to step back and not be as close and be cautious and [lipsmack] it's a shame and you wish that it could be like your other friendships it doesn't always work like like that 

301.39 302.39 A: yeah 

303.53 304.80 A: i've had people 

306.91 307.83 A: right 

308.01 317.47 A: a lot of people where they just sort of use you they just like you're just basically there to like hear them gripe but they don't want to hear anything about your life it's just they wanna l- 

311.54 312.57 B: mhm 

317.48 323.81 A: they wanna like bitch and moan about everyone else but they don't want to hear about any of your issues and if you bring something up it's like 

319.61 320.49 B: mhm 

322.13 323.14 B: right 

323.89 326.12 A: oh they brush it off and [sigh] 

325.97 334.15 B: yeah it's also funny when you're just like they're [lipsmack] you think you might be developing a new friendship it is becoming a very nice i was walking with somebody um 

334.52 338.73 B: for a n- number of months once a week we'd walk together 

338.84 343.14 B: and you get to talk while you're walking and it's very nice and i thought that was really great 

343.15 347.85 B: well she found something to do called spinning and this and that other things to do 

348.06 357.93 B: (( [mn] other than walking and got busy with other things and we weren't walking anymore and she doesn't talk to me every anymore you know [laughter] you thought you had a f- new friend [laughter] )) 

354.72 356.33 A: (( mhm oh )) 

357.27 358.81 A: yeah exactly 

358.24 370.05 B: and they disappear but you know when i lo- the other thing that i found though over the years especially um i work part time and a lot of my friends work full time and they literally do not have the time for friendship 

359.38 360.43 A: right 

369.32 371.97 A: yeah it's becoming that way isn't it 

371.69 374.71 B: and that what i i found a lot of that happening mm 

374.31 377.47 A: yeah that's interesting because there is like um 

378.02 387.51 A: a article i just read in um a journal and it talked about how our yo- our whole way of society is changing and where friendships 

387.49 388.52 A: um 

388.43 395.38 A: [sigh] i cannot remember i think it was like something it was reflecting on a book that was written about bo- i think it was bowling or something 

395.24 409.81 A: anyways it was talking about how the friendships where we used to have where we'd like get together and bowl you know that kind of thing or you get together for p._t._a. those are long times are long gone we don't have those social structures any longer 

400.70 401.52 B: mhm 

401.69 402.67 B: mhm 

404.38 405.21 B: mhm 

406.51 407.84 B: right well i 

408.50 410.29 B: right i find other 

410.66 423.98 B: things somewhat similar too i think email is changing the nature of relationships with people even with i have two younger brothers and they seem to prefer to email rather than call 

413.42 414.28 A: (( mm )) 

416.14 417.40 A: mhm 

423.63 424.61 A: yep 

423.99 434.10 B: and i we lose the personal touch it becomes very cold it becomes ver- you know like like a sentence two sentences very abrupt and sharp and [sigh] 

429.78 430.66 A: right 

433.01 434.37 A: exactly 

434.73 444.05 B: it loses too much and but when i call i'm interrupting their lives [laughter] don't call me now i'm getting the children to bed don't call me now it's too late don't ca [sigh] 

434.80 435.81 A: yep 

439.74 440.68 A: right 

443.52 446.48 A: yep you feel like you're always an intrusion 

446.32 447.35 B: mhm 

446.74 457.44 A: yeah i know exactly what in fact my husband and i tonight we went out we were on the way home we were talking about resume writing and how um tech the tech industry has really changed the ways resumes are being written 

457.28 467.93 A: they used to be like superficial you know you just write like this whole long thing about you know you'd really fluff yourself up and now head hunters all they want to know is like facts 

463.89 464.75 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

466.81 468.45 B: get to the point [laughter] 

467.85 474.00 A: exactly don't even use like adjectives just write down what you do and that's it and that's like [noise] 

472.27 478.06 B: mhm and they'll hopefully find out more about you in the interview if you get the interview [laughter] 

477.06 485.05 A: exactly and you really can't you know for a person who is like doesn't have a lot on their under their belts that's hard because you know 

482.50 483.58 B: mhm 

483.78 484.81 B: (( right right )) 

485.11 494.44 A: it's cold hard facts and you can't really play with it any more like you used to sort of a reflection of our society and the whole mentality that our f- that friendships 

494.34 501.20 A: um they don't have that closeness and there's no time and it just seems like it's a rat race everybody's going going going 

500.82 501.97 B: mhm 

501.64 502.92 A: yeah 

502.28 512.56 B: well that's for sure and that's wh- what's making it more difficult to have those close friendships that i guess ha- had been established long ago by [laughter] myself with my friends and [mn] 

512.74 515.01 B: it just it's different now it's 

515.21 519.62 B: it's really harder and i you know aware that it's sometimes maintaining it 

519.84 522.43 B: i i hate to be the one to have to keep it 

522.72 529.67 B: i i'm often the one who has to keep the friendships together um there was a [lipsmack] not a close friendship but a nice group 

529.52 538.33 B: through a mother centre that i was part of when i moved into the community about twenty years ago and then we would still continue to get together every now and then 

538.24 547.31 B: but then everyone kept looking at me to get us together and set the date and if i didn't call didn't happen [laughter] so it hasn't been happening i'm it's 

544.36 546.37 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

547.32 559.26 B: falling apart it's like i don't know why they all look to me and nobody else took the re- there were like four or five of us and no one else took the responsibility we hav- we didn't see each other last year as a group as we had in the past and it 

548.62 551.72 A: [sigh] and you're sick of it yeah right [laughter] 

559.35 566.04 B: i guess i better remember to call again but um i think you're right though just people are so busy with so many things 

560.70 562.48 A: [laughter] 

566.10 568.19 B: and as i said before too with 

568.24 570.17 B: w- w- women working 

570.32 578.79 B: it just um there just isn't time for friendships as much as there had been maybe that why my old one reason my old friends are my closer friends 

571.35 572.36 A: yeah 

578.35 579.10 A: [mn] 

579.39 579.95 B: (( [mn] )) 

579.40 580.59 A: go ahead i'm sorry 

579.96 582.17 B: yes okay go ahead you go [sigh] 

582.11 584.49 A: i was just going to say that i had a um 

584.94 587.71 A: girlfriend that we used to be pen pals 

587.16 588.07 B: (( mm )) 

587.72 599.89 A: and we when i had a really rough childhood and a really bad situation in my household and we would write each other and that was like my escape and um we wrote from the time we wer- we were about eleven 

591.12 592.08 B: mhm 

592.56 593.38 B: mhm 

596.09 597.14 B: mhm
