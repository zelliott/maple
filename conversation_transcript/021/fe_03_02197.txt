19.34 20.97 A: [laughter] 

20.11 23.64 B: i am definitely a restaurant person um 

22.66 24.82 A: [laughter] 

23.79 28.90 B: they say there's nothing like a home cooked meal i beg to differ [laughter] i mean 

28.03 30.41 A: [laughter] 

29.21 30.38 B: if i had 

30.70 36.70 B: if i had this you know this unlimited disposable income i would probably eat out all the time but um 

35.75 36.94 A: you would 

36.74 38.19 B: yeah yeah 

36.98 40.52 A: if it were- if you had the money you'd prefer to eat out all the time 

40.27 41.82 B: yeah yeah 

41.01 42.90 A: even breakfast and lunch 

43.53 44.25 B: (( uh )) 

44.67 46.44 B: yeah probably 

45.03 47.54 A: are you a three meal a day person 

47.53 51.68 B: i am a i'm a three meal a day person so that's why i'd do 'em all 

49.92 51.33 A: yeah 

51.70 52.69 B: yeah 

51.73 54.07 A: [laughter] 

52.96 55.62 B: i mean i i'm starting to cook more because 

56.36 62.04 B: well because i [laughter] need to start to cook more and i just want to enjoy the process of cooking 

62.28 63.28 B: (( it's good to eat )) 

62.31 63.69 A: do you work 

63.56 64.87 B: yes i do 

64.75 68.99 A: so ti- is time a factor in that decision to prefer to eat out 

68.92 72.21 B: (( um somewhat )) 

72.22 75.85 A: if you had more time you could probably cook more [laughter] 

72.48 73.54 B: but no but 

75.22 86.12 B: probably but then i mean i think about what i if i'm work- if i'm if i have a big meal when i pick up you know 'cause i also like a slow meal too [laughter] so you know like 

85.46 86.72 A: sure 

86.27 88.01 B: yeah this is 

86.80 97.18 A: well i'm i'm i'm kinda torn on this question because i love to cook i grew up with an italian mother you know and she made everything from scratch 

89.85 90.69 B: yeah 

92.54 93.44 B: mhm 

94.96 96.36 B: oh 

96.68 97.92 B: gotcha 

97.85 106.61 A: and then my family owned a restaurant in in a in a resort and i i grew up working and playing in the restaurant 

101.41 102.49 B: (( [sigh] oh )) 

102.98 103.90 B: uh-huh 

106.80 108.38 B: oh that sounds great 

106.95 111.25 A: you know and so i you know and i ate a lot of meals at home 

111.25 113.95 A: with you know and learned how to cook from scratch 

113.64 114.47 B: uh-huh 

113.91 126.53 A: and then i ate a lot of meals at the restaurant and my parents idea of like taking us out for a great birthday or a special occasion was to go to a restaurant so i link that in my mind to 

126.50 134.83 A: it's special when you go to a restaurant so i love going to restaurants but i also love to cook the kind of food that i want to eat at home 

132.30 133.23 B: yeah 

134.92 136.29 B: mhm mhm 

135.89 136.81 A: so 

136.97 140.13 A: if i had to choose between one and the other 

140.36 142.48 A: i'd probably choose 

142.50 147.51 A: cooking at home 'cause i'd definitely as long as i had enough time and ingredients 

147.68 156.31 A: you know and maybe even a little help [laughter] i you know i would prefer that because then i could make it exactly the way i want it 

150.24 151.40 B: yeah 

156.24 159.62 B: yeah and you know exactly what's going in it yeah 

158.94 172.54 A: true true you don't have to worry about whether or not the cooks you know keep a clean kitchen or if you know if there's any e. coli hanging out and you know if they refrigerated the ingredients properly and 

159.81 160.79 B: yeah 

168.30 169.96 B: that's true 

172.32 181.60 B: or if you're allergic to something whether you know peanuts ended in up in there or you know thank god i don't have any food allergies 'cause peanuts tend to be like the worst one to have 

181.42 184.26 A: right well see i grew up with food allergies 

181.66 182.71 B: and it's so 

183.87 185.96 B: yeah oh really 

184.45 198.79 A: in fact i was probably allergic to more foods than than not so i had to really kind of you know either put up with ah the skin problems that it caused or just you know learn to pick and choose and ask a lot of questions when i went out 

188.81 190.13 B: really 

197.52 199.49 B: mhm mhm 

199.28 201.35 A: so that's a really good point 

201.86 204.22 A: [laughter] 

203.15 203.77 B: (( yeah )) 

203.85 205.42 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

204.61 215.77 A: you know in fact in fact i i decided to open a restaurant when i was you know in my early thirties and i owned my own restaurant for a while and it was all natural foods 

215.77 218.24 B: really how cool 

217.06 221.18 A: organic and natural healthy vegetarian food and healthy 

218.90 219.77 B: uh-huh 

221.23 227.56 A: chicken and shrimp and fish and you know gourmet vegetarian foods it was really great 

222.73 223.75 B: mhm 

226.25 228.76 B: yeah yeah oh wow 

228.73 231.09 A: so i got spoiled [laughter] 

229.14 229.86 B: yeah 

230.04 234.65 B: but i was going to say you wouldn't happen i'm look i'm always ah good for a new restaurant [laughter] 

233.73 242.80 A: [laughter] well that's another thing do you would you go to the same restaurant or would you go to different restaurants 

235.20 236.23 B: (( [laughter] )) 

237.72 239.30 B: i'd go visit that one 

242.55 246.43 B: i tend to go to the same restaurants because i know 

245.10 247.56 A: really do you have your favorite meals 

247.81 260.34 B: ah favorite meals i actually you know my favorite meals are usually the ones i cook myself so that's kinda weird [laughter] i know i know like when i and i you know i have some things that are like 

254.58 256.91 A: huh [laughter] [mn] [laughter] 

260.33 264.49 B: i don't know like comfort food in a way like ah my mother used to make this chicken 

264.79 274.94 B: soup that was really really good and it had like you know you know bunches of chicken and tomato base with stewed tomatoes and you know and corn and 

274.38 275.78 A: oh yum 

274.94 283.32 B: peas and it and it was really really good and it had bacon in it too so like whenever i feel myself getting sick or i just like to think that's good and hearty you 

283.36 287.04 B: know i've eaten it in the middle of the summertime [laughter] 'cause it's just you know it's 

285.72 287.93 A: [laughter] and you go for that [laughter] 

287.10 289.18 B: yeah yeah it's good and it's co- 

288.10 292.50 A: sure 'cause of the emotional and and the the thought connection to it 

291.81 303.31 B: yeah and it's and it's just easy and i you know i don't have a lot of patience either like um my boyfriend makes fun of me 'cause i cook everything on high [laughter] you know on high on the ah hottest heat i'd ever have he goes 

296.94 298.59 A: [laughter] 

300.57 303.39 A: [laughter] 

303.46 310.51 B: (( like do you hey like have you ever heard of medium i'm like but i just don't have time for medium [laughter] and [laughter] )) 

306.67 312.31 A: [laughter] forget you and sauces [laughter] since you 

311.60 315.39 B: no and i really can't make sauces 

312.41 314.03 A: (( cook them on low )) 

315.42 319.81 B: i try i just i just have to be in it for the long haul [laughter] 

319.49 324.01 A: [laughter] well my restaurant used to do cooking classes too 

320.71 321.70 B: but um 

323.76 325.35 B: uh-huh really 

324.74 328.44 A: for different things yeah for people with allergies for people who 

328.42 343.27 A: had cancer and wanted to eat healthy foods to r- you know to restore their health and and cook you know cooking classes for kids and you know to lose weight or gain weight as the case may be for athletes all that oh god it was so much fun 

332.92 335.15 B: oh really how great 

339.60 340.57 B: mhm 

343.13 350.16 B: or people who find who are trying to if they're trying to be vegetarians with transitioning and trying to get the e- enough enough protein and such 

349.67 355.28 A: yeah and didn't have a clue you know how to do it you know and what to replace ingredients with 

351.83 352.69 B: yeah 

354.99 356.59 B: mhm mhm 

355.81 361.22 A: you know and people who hated to cook but you know need wanted to learn [laughter] 

360.38 363.41 B: yeah yeah that's true it is a skill 

362.46 366.75 A: or wanting to only you know cook on high [laughter] 

363.67 364.59 B: [laughter] 

365.56 378.49 B: i don't like [laughter] well you know i started getting cooking like because you know with this whole thing of cooking for myself and i've gotten better about you know medium and you know and patience with it but still you know it's 

378.49 389.37 A: well you know if you if you only have so much time you you kinda can only you know commit so much time to eating too so cooking on cooking on high works really well in that case 

378.75 380.01 B: (( like ah )) 

385.50 387.17 B: yeah that's true 

388.28 390.16 B: (( [laughter] and then )) 

390.37 391.65 A: [laughter] 

390.59 394.82 B: i think you know the whole restaurant i i shouldn't say i mean 

394.93 405.48 B: it's all so different 'cause usually you go to a restaurant you're with other people and you have the whole speaking experience too like you know i live by myself and and if i'm just cooking for myself i'm probably just gonna 

404.11 406.53 A: plus for social for you yeah 

405.58 408.12 B: (( yeah you know probably gonna you know [mn] )) 

407.01 415.07 A: i like that part of it too because in fact you know a lot of times the restaurant that i go to will depend on who i'm going out to eat with 

414.88 416.74 B: yes that's true yeah 

416.50 426.78 A: you know like there are certain people you'd never go to like a thai restaurant with you know 'cause they would never eat thai food without complaining bitterly for you know the whole meal 

421.43 422.28 B: mhm 

423.59 424.41 B: yeah 

424.85 425.86 B: mhm 

426.66 429.87 B: or just you know like i can never find anything yeah yeah 

426.80 428.51 A: and other people 

429.38 443.28 A: right you know there's nothing on the menu that they'd eat and then there's other people who'd really be adventurous and they'd go to a totally brand new restaurant just for the experience of of of eating something totally new and having you know a 

431.99 432.96 B: mhm 

443.19 448.22 A: a curious meal at you know it's something they had never done before and that would be fun 

447.97 449.86 B: yeah that is yeah 

449.16 451.85 A: so i really i like that part of the social 

452.15 455.41 A: aspect of eating out at restaurants too for me 

454.37 455.32 B: yeah 

456.76 459.22 B: (( that's true yeah i like the social )) 

457.18 463.03 A: and you can talk and you don't have to think about if people are enjoying what you've prepared you know 

462.95 467.87 B: or is there enough this or enough that you just kinda like you know that's someone else's worry 

466.36 473.02 A: yeah [laughter] you call the waitress and say bring more s- bring more bread [laughter] 

468.21 469.41 B: [laughter] 

470.52 477.47 B: yeah yeah we're out of we need another bottle of wine you bring it over it's not your not your not your issue at all 

476.53 482.52 A: yeah an extra spoon for dessert they're eyeing my dessert [laughter] 

481.49 490.64 B: but you know it's so funny when i think about what i want when i ah i shouldn't say when i grow up but when i like i have more disposable income and like i want a nice kitchen 

490.87 494.42 B: 'cause i think that might propel me to want to cook more you know 

493.54 496.00 A: [laughter] oh it totally makes a difference 

495.54 499.14 B: 'cause my kitchen is so cramped and i cook on it but i'm just like you know 

499.26 508.41 A: well when you have a kitchen that's totally stocked and it's big enough and you've got you know a full pantry and you've got everything all the herbs and the spices and 

507.71 509.09 B: oh yeah 

508.28 518.53 A: you know all kinds of pasta and all kinds of sauces and all the condiments and you've got everything there for you you know and and and then you can make whatever you're in the mood for 

512.32 513.36 B: mhm 

518.44 519.76 B: that's true 

518.91 526.15 A: you know and you're much more likely to to do to cook when you can just whatever you're hungry for it's totally you know 

526.31 530.77 A: your you have the freedom to do whatever you want you're much more likely to cook 

528.80 529.86 B: mhm 

530.23 536.31 B: yeah yeah that's true so what would be you're ah what's your perfect meal your favorite meal 

536.42 540.73 A: my perfect meal has to be um [lipsmack] 

540.86 545.50 A: there's there's this one restaurant that i really like it's called the urban onion 

545.73 546.69 B: oh 

546.09 554.71 A: and my kids love it my partner loves it my friends love it so it's kinda like whoever i can go with they always love it 

549.54 550.48 B: mhm 

553.11 554.35 B: (( where is it )) 

554.65 561.41 A: and i have i ha- my perfect meal is they make these casidieres that are just delicious 

560.52 562.33 B: mhm mhm 

561.57 571.29 A: with a dipping sauce that's just got the perfect amount of jalapeno and scallions and and cilantro and cheese and beans and spice 

569.32 572.28 B: (( huh cilantro's the best mhm )) 

571.66 576.92 A: and so you can put as much dip on your casidiere as you want so it's kinda like i can get it my way 

576.91 578.17 B: yeah yeah 

577.26 587.25 A: and then and then i dive into the salad because they make this delightful lemon tahini dressing that i can't find anywhere else and i can't make it myself 

584.32 585.31 B: (( really )) 

586.85 588.20 B: mhm mhm 

587.51 591.63 A: and they won't tell me what all the ingredients are that go into it so it's really special 

591.98 592.79 B: (( gotcha )) 

592.03 599.51 A: you know it's like the only place i can get it and on their salad it goes really well and then i dive in to the ginger chicken spinach salad 

594.08 595.05 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] ))
