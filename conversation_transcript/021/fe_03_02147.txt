53.14 55.35 A: (( somebody to feed me [laughter] you know [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

54.51 69.39 B: yeah yeah [sigh] i guess ah [mn] i guess i'm the same way in some ways [sigh] um i i like eating out can be ah it can be a treat because there is no cleanup i ah there is ah my wife and two kids in the family and so [sigh] um 

69.25 80.81 B: going out means ah no preparation no cleanup and so on but i also find that [mn] ah especially when i travel [sigh] and then i'm kinda eating out every night you know o- one night after the other and maybe even including breakfast and lunch 

80.77 87.06 B: [sigh] is that you get i i get tired of it ah the ah the novelty wears off [sigh] ah pretty pretty quickly 

82.52 84.12 A: oh yeah huh [noise] 

86.70 93.79 A: [sigh] well the other thing the other thing about i guess you know eating at home is i kinda like [noise] you know i'm married i have two kids too [sigh] 

93.91 103.75 A: and ah i i look forward to that evening meal i mean kinda i don't know it's like fifties television or something but i mean just [sigh] there's something solid there's something [noise] comforting about 

103.76 105.85 A: [sigh] the [noise] the sitting down [noise] 

105.71 120.31 A: [mn] ah you know ah for a meal as a family you know the four of us and how was your days and [sigh] you just kinda [noise] you're catching up with each other i mean this is 'cause we all go here there and yon and [sigh] what goes on i think [noise] you can't get that in a restaurant i mean it's not there's something [noise] about ah [noise] 

120.20 126.98 A: you know eating at home [noise] that that does it and a meal that you [noise] prepared yourself is kind of aesthetically pleasing [noise] i think [mn] 

125.89 135.50 B: [mn] mm [mn] yeah [sigh] yeah yeah that that's ah that's true although [sigh] it can be hard in our family sometimes to to [sigh] ah be creative enough to ah 

135.62 145.48 B: [mn] prepare lots of different kinds of meals and yet find things that everybody likes [sigh] and that's i guess that's an advantage to going out isn't it i mean we we do the same thing you know we kind of eat at ah ten and thirteen so 

138.58 140.22 A: (( [noise] [sigh] yeah i know [noise] )) 

140.84 142.29 A: oh i know 

142.66 144.12 A: (( how old are you kids )) 

144.74 146.49 A: (( [noise] ten and thirteen oh [noise] [noise] )) 

145.53 156.79 B: yeah we're eating dinner every night at at six o'clock more or less you know and um but you know things come and then ah your kids have activities or whatever i have to work late so that doesn't always happen but that's that's the goal [sigh] um 

156.92 169.40 B: ah and generally they're they're not picky eaters but ah you know but but also it's it's kind of fun to go out and where everybody can really ah get exactly ah what what he or she wants of course then we have the problem of finding a restaurant that everybody likes 

168.97 171.04 A: right [laughter] 

169.23 178.15 B: and that's a yeah i can't tell you how many times and you kinda almost get in the car and not even sure where we're going and and that ah that even in itself is difficult [mn] 

178.11 182.17 A: oh i oh i know [sigh] oh who does the cooking at your house 

181.47 193.56 B: [sigh] um mm ah well in early days my wife and i split it but ah now she does the yeah she she does most of the ah of the cooking [sigh] so um [sigh] ah yeah we'll have 

186.22 188.20 A: (( you're gone a lot i think you said )) 

188.23 188.98 A: (( [noise] )) 

193.56 204.24 B: typically kind of a meat related meal maybe y- you know for dinner maybe once or twice a week and then the other nights we're trying to eat you know kinda vegetarian dairy kinds of things just to to 

201.85 207.63 A: oh good for you wow you w- how do you define vegetarian is it like fish vegetarian or [noise] 

205.40 206.92 B: (( ah )) 

207.06 218.45 B: vegetarian for me ah just means k- i guess i should say non meat that would be that would be a better way to describe it which we kind of think of as being somewhat more healthy so fish or pasta or or things things like that [sigh] 

210.35 211.72 A: non meat okay [noise] 

211.99 212.98 A: right [noise] [noise] 

217.18 218.54 A: (( right [noise] )) 

218.41 231.04 B: um and it it's kinda interesting that you know we w- you know after years of doing that you know we know how to make lots of things like that but the reality also is that that in our family we all seem to be carnivores and we really kinda crave those ah 

230.71 231.91 A: (( [noise] i know [noise] )) 

230.86 235.28 B: those meals where it's ah where it's some kinda meat that's kinda interesting that way [noise] 

234.95 243.23 A: oh i know i know [sigh] ah you said something that struck me i don't know i guess oh i do the cooki- you know i'm home from i get 

243.70 256.29 A: off work at two t- i'm a teacher [noise] i work at a school where i'm home early [sigh] and so it's kinda up to me to cook the meal i guess i kinda like put the meal together but i don't like the cleaning so 

245.47 246.81 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

255.69 256.48 B: yeah 

256.14 258.82 A: so i [laughter] but i do i guess i ah you know 

258.72 265.34 A: if you put a gun to my head and said what do you prefer eating out or eating at home i would have to say eating at home because i [noise] 

265.15 279.09 A: i i do like to cook my um you know and i don't like to clean and so i kind of have the [sigh] you know [mn] kinda under [mn] kind of an implied rule in our house that the person who puts the meal together doesn't have to clean it up or whatever [sigh] and so yeah we're kind of a a 

275.92 276.90 B: yeah

319.37 321.19 A: [mn] no but i guess ah 

321.24 332.48 A: my wife and i guess we both when we were dating we had a long courtship and we both [noise] loved to put meals together [noise] i think that was ah [mn] part of our attraction [noise] to each other we both [noise] kind of that was a big thing [noise] for 

332.51 336.79 A: [sigh] four years we you know didn't live together before we got married and we just sort of [sigh] 

336.60 347.63 A: enjoyed getting together on the weekends and putting a meal together you know so it's part of our part of our background part of our ah [sigh] culture as it occurred or ah history as a ah as a [noise] as a couple you know to do that sort of 

346.85 349.49 B: [laughter] yeah so what's a what's a perfect meal to you [noise]

358.77 368.65 A: something that's put together with another person and you know sort of a teamwork kind of an effort sort of a thing and [sigh] i would guess i ah but in terms of what what it would i don't know 

368.54 376.40 A: yeah we're carnivores [noise] but i mean i [sigh] some of our i think [noise] you can be just as creative [noise] or more creative vege- cooking non meat ah cooking meatless
