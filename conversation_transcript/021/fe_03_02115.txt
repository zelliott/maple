253.94 254.72 B: yeah

297.24 299.37 A: (( for a whole semester but yeah )) 

298.60 300.70 B: i wish i'd have done something like that 

300.72 302.21 A: (( summer school [laughter] )) 

301.81 303.66 B: i bet you met a lot of people over there 

303.58 309.40 A: yeah yeah definitely i mean um it was different 'cause i'd been on the study abroad program before 

308.80 309.74 B: uh-huh 

309.51 322.20 A: um i went to rome and actually today um i hung out with probably the only person that i've kept in touch with from that trip like i've kept in touch with i've hung out with and stuff so 

318.87 319.81 B: okay 

321.99 323.14 B: fun 

322.95 324.15 A: that's cool 

324.23 325.04 A: but uh 

324.32 329.16 B: that would be yeah there were some girls um doing a semester abroad 

329.19 331.09 B: that are friends with my friend 

331.24 332.71 B: living in france 

331.40 332.46 A: (( oh okay )) 

332.74 334.17 A: yeah 

332.78 335.55 B: and i was like how cool and they don't even speak french 

335.64 337.23 A: (( yeah [laughter] yeah )) 

336.46 339.14 B: i wish i'd done [laughter] something like that how cool 

338.61 342.62 A: (( i didn't speak italian at all i took a class and that's )) 

341.98 342.93 B: right 

342.81 343.80 A: (( about all )) 

343.76 346.20 B: yeah they said it was all english speaking in class 

346.42 347.70 A: yeah it was 

348.34 353.21 A: my class it wasn't really that difficult and you know but uh 

352.55 353.67 B: yeah 

353.90 360.57 A: yep so i met a lot of good friends through there and then when i just came back from interning over in england 

360.43 361.19 B: (( right )) 

360.58 367.58 A: i met a lot of people that i guess you'd classify as like work friends that you met through work 'cause it wasn't a study abroad program at all 

364.36 365.42 B: right 

367.68 371.62 A: so it was really just kind of like fending for yourself and 

370.89 373.85 B: do you keep in touch with any of those people or do you think you would 

375.51 377.03 A: it's hard because 

376.99 378.21 B: yeah 

377.60 386.86 A: some of the people at work i really didn't go out with at all but then there's some people i mean it was a really unique situation i think um the one 

386.95 393.91 A: it's actually one person that i've i've still really kept in contact with like emailed and stuff like that so 

393.20 399.04 B: yeah i never keep in touch with anybody [laughter] maybe that's why i don't have a big group of friends [laughter] it's 

396.74 397.42 A: [laughter] 

399.58 402.18 A: no it's hard though it's really hard i think 

401.09 402.79 B: hard yeah 

402.40 408.27 A: to keep in with um i mean i like especially when people have different schedules going on 

407.52 408.74 B: mhm 

408.58 411.43 A: you know just different things going on it's 

411.64 413.54 A: it's just hard 

413.08 421.87 B: my boyfriend and i went on a cruise and we met this couple and they were so nice and i sent them one email and they sent me back an email and we haven't talked since and that was like 

421.60 423.21 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

422.08 423.07 B: (( october )) 

423.45 425.63 A: it's just really hard especially like 

425.90 430.52 A: to i think to meet like really good friends is really hard because 

429.87 435.70 B: oh absolutely it gets harder too when you get i mean as you get away from college it's going to be even harder to meet people 

435.77 436.59 A: oh 

436.00 441.30 B: specially guys i mean [laughter] meeting guys is not as easy as it was in college 

438.24 439.05 A: [laughter] 

440.99 452.86 A: yeah actually um the girl i lived with in england i remember her telling me that um she was like twenty five but she didn't have a boyfriend and she was like oh she was like i really wish that you know 

441.36 441.92 B: (( [laughter] )) 

446.70 447.46 B: uh-huh 

453.68 458.60 A: i could meet like more guys she was like 'cause in college they're like everywhere

467.60 471.32 B: and who wants to work with somebody that you're dating in case it breaks up
