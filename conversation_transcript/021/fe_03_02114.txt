148.99 149.71 B: (( i know ))

155.55 156.82 A: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

156.08 159.66 B: and you know people from school stay here and people from work stay here 

159.50 171.18 B: and i'm actually uncomfortable with that i always feel strange when somebody doesn't want to introduce me to people in their other world even if we're just friends i you know not dating or anything just wanna go out um i don't know 

166.21 167.56 A: right 

169.49 170.67 A: yeah 

171.35 186.04 B: the best friend question is sort of weird for me i i feel like there're different people who at different times in my life were you know definitely there for me and maybe now we're not as close but like you said you know you don't have to see people for a long time and then you see them and it's great um 

179.20 180.47 A: (( right [noise] )) 

186.55 194.20 B: my sister recently moved back to new york so i'd say right now she's really you know the person i call up first when something 

194.22 200.67 B: happens or something pisses me off but i don't know if sisters count as best friends because that's like you know 

199.04 203.02 A: [noise] well they could be i think [laughter] 

202.38 204.24 B: do you have any siblings 

204.23 206.85 A: [noise] yeah i actually have a brother and a sister 

206.98 210.49 B: and would you consider them what you know your closest friends 

209.89 215.66 A: um you know my brother and i actually were very close friends growing up [noise] no you can't talk 

215.54 216.83 B: [laughter] 

216.10 224.32 A: [laughter] 'cause we're only a year apart and people couldn't believe that like in high school we did everything together we had the same group of friends and you know 

218.64 219.41 B: uh-huh 

222.03 223.35 B: that's great 

224.24 238.26 A: but uh we just enjoyed that you know and now i've moved away [noise] and so i don't see him as often so but i still think we're you know pretty close you know i know if i ever needed something he'd be there for me 

227.21 228.41 B: mhm 

230.27 231.13 B: mhm 

232.23 232.91 B: (( mm )) 

234.98 235.76 B: right 

238.03 238.98 B: oh that's great 

238.53 242.84 A: and my sister [noise] i'm pretty close to except that she's thirteen years younger than me 

242.65 244.74 B: oh that's a big difference 

242.95 243.75 A: so 

244.24 249.09 A: so she's only in high school right now [laughter] you know but i mean she's 

246.45 247.50 B: [laughter] 

247.62 249.77 B: (( oh wow you're leading very different lives )) 

249.27 256.13 A: yeah [noise] so it's pretty different although i realize that you know like if she really needs to talk she'll call me though 

255.71 256.79 B: mhm 

256.18 258.27 A: (( you know so i )) 

257.26 258.79 B: even though she's in high school 

258.50 260.30 A: yeah 

259.28 262.47 B: i feel like especially at that age um 

262.68 271.45 B: uh my roommate's a walking american beauty right now you know the idea of friendship and who you talk to is so restricted by who your peers talk to for their you know for their advice 

269.60 270.42 A: mhm 

271.04 272.20 A: mhm 

271.59 274.51 B: and i'm i don't know i don't remember 

275.19 280.71 B: at that point i don't remember really talking to a lot of older people although now i don't know why i didn't do that 

280.37 281.57 A: right 

280.72 285.44 B: so people who have did similar things you know or had that experience before 

285.77 290.75 B: but when you um the best friend you have now how long have you known her or him i don't 

290.29 294.13 A: um for about a yeh let me think 

294.32 296.19 A: for about twelve years 

295.92 297.61 B: know [noise] oh wow that's a long time 

297.05 299.20 A: [noise] yeah we met in college 

298.90 300.13 B: (( okay [noise] )) 

299.45 307.99 A: and then we um we both moved out away from our families to start our teaching careers together so we really kind of bonded that way [laughter] from 

307.70 308.79 B: mhm 

307.90 316.79 A: both being far away from home and stuff [noise] and then well i've moved away from there now but you know she still lives out in michigan where we were at and stuff so [noise] 

314.99 315.80 B: okay 

316.68 318.59 B: yeah that's definitely 

316.88 317.65 A: so 

318.90 320.45 B: very bonding [laughter] 

319.98 333.25 A: yeah well i think that's where we especially bonded 'cause we both moved far away from our families and that's all we had was each other you know [laughter] so then that kinda brings you together and and then i i hooked up with her husband too so 

324.99 326.01 B: mhm 

327.63 328.65 B: mhm 

332.75 333.78 B: [laughter] 

333.08 338.04 A: you know that helps a little bit too [laughter] [sigh] 

334.19 335.10 B: [laughter] 

336.30 343.85 B: um i think some of my best friends i actually went through a sort of similar experience because i did americorps i don't know if you know what that is 

339.95 340.55 A: (( [noise] )) 

343.27 344.44 A: what is it 

344.06 348.18 B: americorps it's sort of like the peace corps but you stay in the u. s. 

347.10 347.66 A: (( wh- )) 

347.78 349.19 A: oh okay 

348.97 353.60 B: and um instead of doing an individual project i was on a team of people 

353.44 354.69 A: oh 

353.69 357.02 B: and we traveled around and did you know all sorts of things like 

357.10 364.75 B: you know in education environment public safety and and all these projects [lipsmack] um but you couldn't get away from each other you know it's like 

364.23 364.81 A: [noise] 

364.77 371.31 B: just sort of like you're saying you're bonding over the projects but the truth was you were bonding because you spent all this time together [laughter] and you 

365.06 366.99 A: yeah [noise] 

369.42 372.46 A: yeah [laughter] you didn't have much choice [laughter] 

371.36 384.60 B: you had to figure out how to deal with each other you know how to and those are people who are mostly like sort of like you said who i don't see very often you know they live all over the u._s. and none of them live in new york city which is where i live and 

373.26 374.64 A: [noise] 

383.38 384.40 A: [noise] okay 

385.54 397.54 B: and i like i can see them and immediately we just go back to that you know that team feeling we had and it's amazing because um there was one person on the team who 

388.82 389.85 A: (( [noise] )) 

392.33 393.45 A: right 

394.83 396.29 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

397.73 409.26 B: actually sort of hated me during that time [laughter] it was amazing he just totally hated me um for no reason that anybody knew and as soon as the thing as soon as the the program was over 

400.48 401.55 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

409.25 420.36 B: you know he sort of decided he loved me you know it's just that that kind of wow we've done this whole thing together and how could i not you know appreciate you know these things that we've gone through and it was just you know good to 

412.94 414.65 A: (( [noise] right )) 

415.04 416.05 A: yeah 

420.46 423.99 B: it was good to finally see something like that you know see someone 

422.19 423.72 A: [noise] yeah that's 

424.08 426.72 A: that's quite a good great experience 

425.88 433.47 B: [laughter] it was pretty it was cool how long how long were you and your friend living in the same city before she moved away 

427.95 429.05 A: i bet 

432.40 440.16 A: [noise] well we went to college four years together and then we lived um out in michigan together for three years 

439.68 441.09 B: mhm 

440.18 442.90 A: so we were together for seven years you know 

441.83 443.28 B: oh that's a long time 

443.14 448.90 A: yeah pretty close you know 'cause when you live in the dorms and stuff ya you know you [laughter] 

444.67 445.69 B: mhm 

447.60 449.51 B: spend a lot of time together 

448.80 459.18 A: yeah you do and then like i said out there it was just a kind of survival you know we both were starting new careers and we had no family nobody near us you know except each other so 

456.32 456.88 B: (( [noise] )) 

457.21 458.13 B: mhm 

459.24 462.15 A: that's a special relationship i think you know 

461.53 465.49 B: is one of the reasons you decided to go out there because you had her to go out with mm is 

465.41 477.80 A: [noise] actually the school i graduated from we were assigned to our first um teaching position and we both just happened and we just happened to both get assigned out there 'cause we teach in a i was teaching in a private school 

471.10 472.34 B: that usual 

477.53 478.38 B: okay 

478.31 484.57 A: so and that was just part of the agreement you know they would give you a place to teach if you would go anywhere in the united states 

484.74 486.58 B: is that is that usual though 

485.45 495.97 A: [laughter] um that's not usual it i think our college is probably the only one that does that yeah most people think that sounds pretty strange [laughter] 

489.69 490.90 B: is a bit different 

491.40 492.23 B: (( okay )) 

492.32 493.64 B: i haven't heard of that 

494.73 498.02 B: [laughter] well do they pay for your school if you do that 

497.65 498.45 A: no 

498.47 499.81 B: (( oh wow okay [noise] )) 

498.72 506.53 A: well they do they do pay part of it actually i take that back 'cause it's a private university and they do reimburse you part of it part of you know 

505.09 505.94 B: okay 

506.59 510.16 A: so that you'll be trained to teach in their schools and stuff so [noise] 

509.09 509.88 B: (( okay )) 

510.10 515.00 B: but that's still pretty not knowing where you're going to go and how you know what you're going to do 

510.34 511.18 A: yeah 

513.07 513.77 A: (( no )) 

514.63 521.88 A: no you they tell you the end of may and you move by the end of june usually [laughter] [noise] so 

517.96 519.75 B: [laughter] 

521.21 521.97 B: and 

522.08 525.93 B: besides her i mean you said you like to have lots of friends um 

525.63 526.20 A: (( [noise] )) 

525.98 534.58 B: do you usually meet your friends through work or through other friends or randomly sort of on the street kind of walk up to strangers thing 

532.97 536.25 A: yeah well actually i work in my own um 

536.46 541.78 A: internet business and so i'm always out and i'm sharing it with other people and so 

537.73 538.51 B: okay 

541.70 548.84 A: i love to do that i love to go out and share and like make a friend with them you know so we have a working relationship or 

545.86 546.81 B: mhm 

548.63 558.20 A: even when i'm just out and about i love to talk to people 'cause i you know maybe they're the one i'm looking for and i could help 'em or something you know that's the way i love to help people 

551.70 552.48 B: okay 

554.45 555.27 B: [laughter] 

555.84 556.78 B: mhm 

558.11 563.79 A: so i'm always thinking all right i you know i want to meet this person 'cause maybe maybe we'll be a friend you know 

563.65 564.58 B: mhm 

563.77 574.50 A: and i just actually yesterday and today started taking real estate classes and i came home and i told my husband like all right this girl my classmate she needs a friend i'm going to be her friend [laughter] he's like 

568.22 569.32 B: oh good 

572.76 574.00 B: [laughter] 

574.50 581.65 A: does she want you to be her friend [laughter] i'm like i don't care if she wants to or not and i'm going to be her friend [laughter] 

576.32 577.99 B: yeah i think 

579.24 581.09 B: i think that's important i mean i 

581.25 588.08 B: i know maybe twice that's not very many but twice in my life i made a conscious decision that i was going to be friends with someone 

587.73 588.58 A: uh-huh 

588.11 589.82 B: and i just did it you know and it's 

589.87 599.89 B: so it's amazing to me sort of how attitude affects you know even relationship i mean i guess that happens a lot when you're married um but even with just friendships you know you can decide whether you 

596.71 599.26 A: (( yeah ))
