11.62 12.76 B: new jersey 

12.29 19.67 A: okay i'm in new york myself uh the uh topic of our conversation i'm told today is uh eating out or eating at home 

18.25 21.30 B: huh mhm okay [laughter] [laughter] 

20.11 22.38 A: and uh [laughter] it's interesting because 

22.17 32.30 A: [cough] in my case i'm a mystery shopper and i eat out uh only to satisfy those requirements [sigh] i don't normally eat out on my own i really would rather eat home how do you feel about eating out uh 

32.08 37.35 A: either c- cost wise or uh [sigh] uh you know for convenience or uh wh- 

32.13 33.04 B: well 

36.51 42.12 B: well i'm a wife [laughter] and i have to do the cooking [laughter] so i like to eat out [laughter] 

39.72 40.84 A: okay 

42.09 45.92 A: okay well you can be creative at home for sure uh 

44.67 49.30 B: yeah um but i've been cooking for thirty four years and [laughter] i'm tired of it 

48.90 50.03 A: yeah [laughter] 

50.21 51.32 A: yeah uh 

51.33 56.27 A: the first thing that comes to my mind when i eat out is the cost versus um 

56.31 68.34 A: eating at home i know you've got um you know consideration there for the labor and so forth eating out but uh i've heard it's said that eating out is normally about uh four or five times the uh 

61.14 62.97 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

68.58 79.76 A: uh cost of the items as reflected in the bill a- as opposed to eating home where you e- eat for about ten or twenty percent [sigh] do you fin- [cough] have you found any restaurants that are economical that would uh 

75.32 76.61 B: (( oh yeah yeah )) 

79.82 81.26 A: as well as convenient 

81.31 89.28 B: well what we try to do is go for early bird specials and two for one from the entertainment book coupons buy one get one free 

81.37 81.95 A: (( [cough] )) 

87.06 88.28 A: (( oh okay )) 

88.89 90.95 A: are you anywhere near the casinos then 

90.74 95.49 B: um 'bout forty minutes away but we really don't go down there 'cause the restaurants there are 

96.02 97.14 A: okay 

97.02 99.83 B: (( outrageous )) 

97.22 107.99 A: okay because uh i recall in nevada many years ago there were some very good uh type of restaurant deals but [sigh] of course that was a long time ago for me uh in the eighties and uh 

107.58 115.21 B: no las vegas is a lot cheaper than atlantic city atlantic city does not give the bargains that that las vegas does 

112.69 113.93 A: mhm 

114.96 122.15 A: well do you find that the uh the courtesy within the restaurants and the wait time and the uh [sigh] and the uh 

122.11 130.07 A: uh you know th- the various types of items on the menu uh make up for the costs are you pretty much satisfied with your favorite restaurants 

130.66 139.49 B: they're all right but uh to be perfectly honest my cooking's better [laughter] [laughter] an- and i know my husband agrees with that but sometimes you just need a break 

134.21 136.05 A: (( [laughter] so )) 

139.19 142.72 A: okay so you don't really make it a habit in eating out then you just uh 

142.16 144.64 B: no we do tw- at least twice a week 

144.47 145.61 A: okay 

145.64 159.40 A: well that's that that's good that's probably th- uh about the average today i know that um [sigh] um you know people are so darn busy that they almost have to eat out today and i think it's a lot more predominant in the south i've seen than up here 

155.44 156.70 B: mhm 

159.80 166.35 A: um i think it's 'cause the heat down here involved with uh being in the kitchen cooking it probably has a lot to do with it 

165.46 172.28 B: well my parents live in florida and it's a lot cheaper down there to eat out that i see when we got to visit them 

170.59 171.57 A: uh-huh 

172.32 180.96 A: well that's down south in the south east especially it's a generally low costed area low cost of living and that uh transposes over to the uh 

176.91 178.71 B: (( mhm )) 

181.06 183.30 A: uh outdoor eating as well 

182.97 186.95 B: now i live at the shore and in the summer the prices are horrendous 

186.38 187.79 A: oh they change huh 

187.25 190.28 B: mhm [laughter] because of all the tourists 

190.51 194.24 A: uh well i- it makes you want to bring a doggie bag along doesn't it 

193.60 194.78 B: mhm 

195.07 202.25 B: but i mean uh there's a lot of times i'll go to a restaurant i won't eat uh something that i chicken marsala i won't eat in a restaurant 'cause i can make it 

195.13 196.32 A: (( uh d- )) 

202.31 203.84 B: just as good at home 

203.13 204.98 A: (( mhm [cough] )) 

203.86 206.75 B: and i try to eat things that i don't cook at home 

206.43 211.74 A: mhm well that's that's probably uh the reason a lot of people uh 

211.82 222.08 A: go out you know just for the variety sake they don't have available to them at home [sigh] uh do you usually eat uh just you and your husband or do you uh bring friends or family with you when you go out 

221.07 226.68 B: mhm no we usually just go the two of us 'cause it's easier to just go when we want where we want and not have to argue [laughter] 

226.55 227.56 A: okay 

227.19 234.14 B: with other people of course you know we'll take our children out some tim- they're grown but if they're around we'll take them to eat with us 

232.85 237.34 A: mhm well it's nice to make it a bit of a family affair too especially if you have the time 

235.20 236.69 B: yeah 

237.65 240.12 A: uh [cough] excuse me the um 

240.44 243.79 A: uh many times people look uh for the sunday uh 

243.88 256.76 A: uh restaurant coupons in the newspapers do you ever find yourself uh coming across those um i don't think i could name the restaurants but there some of the more f- uh common family uh style restaurants 

246.09 247.20 B: mhm 

255.15 260.26 B: oh yeah like um olive garden and t. g. i. fridays we don't really frequent those restaurants 

259.78 262.89 A: mm oh okay so you have special ones then 

262.83 265.49 B: (( yeah um )) 

262.97 266.97 A: i mean you have favorite restaurants as opposed to others 

265.55 266.35 B: per- 

266.41 269.59 B: personally i prefer non chain restaurants 

269.03 270.18 A: (( [cough] mhm )) 

269.97 271.65 B: i find that they're 

272.01 273.29 B: a lot better 

273.50 276.86 B: i mean the chain restaurants you know what you're gonna get no matter where you go 

273.62 274.29 A: oh 

276.23 280.90 A: yeah that's for sure you can get uh kind of tired of the uh uh the food pretty fast 

279.11 280.06 B: mhm 

280.48 281.45 B: mhm 

281.31 291.02 A: uh even though they do have specials now and then but uh [sigh] uh you know you have to know your prices i think and it has to be convenient to home too do you ever go to the uh 

287.85 288.69 B: (( mhm mm )) 

291.20 294.54 A: chinese style buffet restaurants those are a very good value 

294.36 299.03 B: i'm not a big buffet person because i [laughter] think of the germs and everything 

298.35 299.75 A: really 

299.05 301.49 B: yeah [laughter] i'm weird i guess 

301.26 308.84 A: well you probably might uh uh you wouldn't look to good eating with the uh one of those face uh m- masks on either a little inconvenient 

301.55 302.52 B: but 

306.12 307.37 B: no [laughter] 

308.49 312.93 B: no i just don't like that people let their children touch everything and 

309.15 309.81 A: (( [laughter] )) 

312.94 314.86 B: cough on things 

313.89 317.50 A: well if you go early and you're the first in line even that's not 

316.07 319.31 B: yeah that we've done but we [laughter] [laughter] 

317.69 318.77 A: [laughter] 

318.96 329.93 A: 'cause i've been to some chinese restaurants where th- the spreads were immense i mean three or four tables long tables you know you you just couldn't really take a little bit of everything it's impossible 

325.62 326.52 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

329.47 337.24 B: well down where we live the chinese restaurants are horrible but that's i think because i grew up eating in chinatown in new york city and 

337.62 339.55 B: you know they're so much better there 

339.54 340.69 A: (( oh okay )) 

339.86 342.01 B: nothing can compare down here 

342.14 348.62 A: i don't know chinese food enough to make the comparison so [sigh] i guess to me if i see a big spread i'll i'll be happy i don't care what 

347.52 348.78 B: [laughter] 

349.12 350.92 A: (( [laughter] [cough] but um )) 

349.65 350.66 B: no there 

351.09 351.92 A: um 

351.55 352.96 B: there's a big difference 

353.12 362.09 A: uh-huh so y- you're a bit of a a connoisseur then when it comes to eating out you sort of pick your places and you just uh you don't really uh just 

362.60 365.46 A: g- go haphazardly into any place that 

365.81 368.19 A: you know th- where there might be a parking spot 

367.77 374.86 B: no no and right now we're in in search for a good greek restaurant we're going all over [laughter] looking for one we can't find one 

371.74 372.68 A: oh 

374.05 374.73 A: hm 

374.74 379.39 A: well um i'm sure you started with the yellow pages didn't you of the phone book 

375.28 376.10 B: [laughter] 

378.37 385.12 B: oh yeah mhm oh and i've spoken to some um restaurant reviewers from different websites 

384.69 385.86 A: mhm 

385.27 388.43 B: and none of them have any [laughter] ideas either 

388.20 401.44 A: i'd be darned if you can't find it on a website now i'm just wondering uh you know maybe you need to maybe if you have any greek friends you could talk them into opening a place uh in jersey it sounds like they need the uh you know representation there 

401.15 405.46 B: i just think that greek food just isn't big here 

405.71 407.98 A: uh-huh have you had it over there 

406.30 407.26 B: (( but uh )) 

408.18 410.59 A: i mean a- are you familiar w- with it 

411.20 412.81 B: what do you mean in new york or 

411.74 414.01 A: well no the greek food in general 

413.59 415.81 B: yeah mhm mhm 

414.84 424.42 A: okay um that's one thing that i i come to think of it never um [sigh] never really uh sampled here unless you go to a uh street festival um 

415.82 416.74 B: um 

424.22 425.19 B: mhm

430.42 431.38 A: [laughter] 

431.80 436.67 A: but that's really not restaurant food you just have to hope that whose ever uh 

433.82 434.62 B: (( no )) 

436.69 445.22 A: uh doing the church work is a good cook and uh you know you may be surprised but again you have to be near a large city i would think
