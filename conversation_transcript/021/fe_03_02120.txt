22.81 23.86 A: yeah 

24.63 28.61 A: i don't really have a lot of friends i i i i tend to keep 

28.79 36.22 A: [sigh] my circle of friends to a select few i might have acquaintances but i don't really have a lot of friends 

31.43 32.22 B: (( mm mm )) 

36.58 40.71 A: i don't know i find that a lot of times 

41.59 43.30 A: (( [sigh] uh friends uh )) 

44.47 55.12 A: it causes problems to have a whole lot of friends because people have certain expectation levels [noise] and and you can't [noise] fulfil them and meet those expectation levels and then you find yourself in a 

55.37 59.14 A: lot of headache and heartache so it's easier just to have a couple 

59.15 65.51 B: oh sure yeah i have uh and they're divided up into two groups of friends that i go out with but don't really get along with each other so 

64.55 65.65 A: [laughter] oh man 

65.56 75.06 B: i've ended up you know dividing my saturdays like you know two saturdays with one group out of each month and then two saturdays with the other group out of each month and [sigh] oy it's insane 

74.43 75.06 A: (( mm )) 

75.30 79.97 B: but actually i really only usually only have like one or two really good friends 

80.00 82.47 B: like my roommate than

88.39 90.00 A: yeah i think so too 

90.89 96.88 A: uh uh the other thing too is i mean who has really ti- it it takes time to maintain friendships [noise] 

97.51 106.20 A: [noise] in in between work and [noise] and i'm married and i have kids and i just don't have the time to devote to friendships like i used to 

97.60 98.30 B: (( mm mm mm )) 

106.90 118.55 A: i you know to go out and socialize and i i don't really find that i have the time to do a lot of those things and my friendships are pretty much you know 

118.86 126.03 A: relegated to telephone friendships or work friendships not really the friendships that i had maybe when i was you know 

122.31 123.21 B: mhm

127.98 129.20 B: (( [laughter] mm i )) 

129.91 133.63 B: find that another problem is you know i'm living in l. a. 

134.14 136.34 B: and it's really hard to have friends in l. a. 

136.92 139.85 B: 'cause a lot of people are just i don't know 

139.86 141.21 B: non reliable 

141.21 142.62 A: (( yeah )) 

142.00 151.09 B: uh it's hard to get a a decent yes or no answer out of anybody or it's you know let's go out let's get together on friday okay yeah sure we're getting together on friday 

151.35 156.57 B: and of course friday rolls around and oh i'm sorry you know something came up i'm busy blah blah blah blah
