128.88 129.89 B: (( i )) 

130.48 140.31 B: let's see since i don't cook very much and my husband doesn't like fish i like fish but my husband doesn't like it so i either have to cook chicken 

140.88 145.73 B: um usually we only have meat when he cooks

150.05 151.11 B: but 

151.00 151.65 A: (( mhm )) 

151.52 154.49 B: i usually just make chicken dishes or 

154.77 158.48 B: casseroles like a tuna casserole or something like that 

158.10 159.26 A: okay 

159.92 163.83 B: wh- what was the rest of the question was that the whole question whether we 

162.93 166.44 A: our our topic is food and we're supposed to talk about 

166.52 170.11 A: whether we prefer to eat in a restaurant or at home and why 

170.06 171.60 B: oh i see 

171.50 177.00 A: yeah and my why for the restaurant is because my family just doesn't appreciate it 

177.06 178.42 A: as much 

178.13 180.30 B: yeah and my why 

179.26 182.22 A: because they're fussy and 

181.19 183.02 B: oh yeah 

182.53 184.38 A: that you know and that's why 

184.20 185.21 B: yeah 

184.61 187.35 A: they're fussy and they just i mean 

188.09 193.95 A: it you know how when you h- have guests yeah it's like when you don't have to cook you appreciate the food a lot more [laughter] 

193.10 200.37 B: yeah that's true yeah yeah because usually i- if i cook for people i don't feel like eating 

194.81 196.05 A: (( mhm )) 

200.67 202.48 B: after i cook it you know 

202.21 203.22 A: uh-huh 

203.94 204.65 B: but 

204.07 206.10 A: i get that way sometimes 

206.34 214.33 B: yeah but i l- i just like to eat out just because i don't want to cook and also i l- i enjoy going to new restaurants 

214.10 215.29 A: mhm 

214.68 217.34 B: i love going to new restaurants 

216.69 221.81 A: well there's several good reasons to go to a restaurant rather than to cook 

222.23 224.01 A: and to me that would be 

224.72 230.32 A: like i said the choice everybody can get something different and they can get it the way they want it 

229.82 230.83 B: right 

230.65 233.64 A: another thing is is you don't have to cook 

233.64 234.69 B: right 

234.09 235.97 A: and you don't have clean up 

235.85 236.99 B: that's right 

236.62 241.74 A: when you're done eating you simply pay the bill and you leave it's awesome [laughter] 

239.50 244.05 B: right [laughter] yeah it is i know 

243.46 253.05 A: where with at home you have to shop for it you have to you have to prepare it you have to clean it up you know after you serve it and 

246.00 247.05 B: right 

252.63 253.70 B: yeah 

253.58 256.48 A: and to try to accommodate fussy eaters is 

256.26 257.37 B: yeah 

257.22 259.05 A: not so fun 

259.37 263.50 B: sometimes i make things from cooking light magazine d- 

263.62 264.50 A: uh-huh 

264.11 265.96 B: did you ever see that magazine 

265.29 266.28 A: uh-huh 

266.65 269.57 B: um i made a ham and lentil stew 

269.67 272.45 B: recently that my husband really likes 

272.82 273.81 A: oh 

272.88 275.49 B: and it and it's real easy 

275.54 284.44 B: it's just ham and lentil beans and um carrots and potatoes and chicken broth 

284.46 288.15 B: is and one can of diced tomatoes 

287.92 289.45 A: it does sound easy 

289.23 292.03 B: yeah it's easy and it's also very filling 

291.78 292.83 A: mhm 

292.55 296.50 B: it's kind of good for a winter night i think 

296.54 299.47 A: right you know in the winter i do prefer to stay home 

300.04 302.24 B: yeah because it's cold out 

301.86 306.65 A: well in michigan the winters are so bad we don't live near anything 

304.23 305.42 B: oh really 

306.55 307.70 B: oh

334.98 338.53 A: in the summer we tend to stay home more because we grill yeah 

338.38 339.95 B: oh that's good

402.87 405.76 A: you know when we when we do go to restaurants a lot 

406.03 409.70 A: and then we get like bad service at one it's that's when i 

410.51 415.97 A: or we go through phases anyway but once we get bad service that kind of wraps it up for me for a while 

415.63 416.76 B: yeah 

417.68 420.26 A: and then i just w- cook at home 

420.00 421.24 B: yeah

429.29 438.65 A: and at lot of times when he's on his way home from work he'll stop and pick something up so is that eating at a restaurant or eating at home i guess that's just the takeout [laughter] the in between 

438.41 440.87 B: oh yeah i guess that is in between 

440.40 441.54 A: uh-huh 

441.99 445.37 B: my husband likes everything cooked from scratch 

445.53 447.73 B: and that's kind of a bummer 

447.78 450.50 B: because you know i can never 

450.98 455.22 B: buy any packaged potato mixes or anything like that 

455.10 455.98 A: uh-huh 

455.53 457.28 B: 'cause he doesn't like it 

457.21 461.41 A: right i cook probably ninety percent from scratch 

461.04 462.52 B: oh that's good 

461.96 465.47 A: i don't make my own bread or anything but we enjoy that at the restaurant 

465.27 466.52 B: yeah 

468.19 470.62 B: yeah what else have i made 

470.89 472.92 B: well we also 

472.08 475.73 A: do you pref- so you prefer dining out hands down 

474.46 476.45 B: yeah yeah i do 

476.23 478.16 A: and does your husband cook at all 

478.15 484.09 B: he he used to cook a lot he's a he's a history professor and now he's a dean 

484.15 485.01 A: uh-huh 

484.32 487.05 B: so now he practically never cooks 

487.25 492.44 B: but he used to cook a lot before before [noise] he was a dean 

492.61 495.56 B: he would stay home and do his research at home 

495.94 498.24 B: so he had more time than i did 

498.48 501.30 B: 'cause i was a medical secretary 

501.15 501.96 A: (( uh-huh )) 

501.55 504.46 B: and i had like an eight thirty to five job 

504.77 507.85 B: and i didn't feel like cooking you know when i got home 

506.95 507.89 A: right 

507.99 511.03 B: but he enjoyed cooking in those days 

510.82 512.98 A: and did you enjoy what he cooked 

513.40 520.92 B: uh i would say fifty percent i i mean i always ate it but some uh some i liked better than others 

520.74 521.86 A: (( uh-huh okay )) 

521.24 524.78 B: and some stuff for example he'll make tacos 

525.36 529.63 B: well tacos are pretty easy you know anybody can make tacos 

529.09 530.09 A: uh-huh 

530.72 531.66 B: so 

532.20 537.29 B: i could probably i could make tacos too but i never make them he- he's always the one who makes them 

537.88 539.93 B: and um he made 

540.67 545.23 B: he has a lot of recipes from when his kids were little that he used to make 

545.75 551.37 B: like let's see there's one pork chop recipe and i don't really like pork chops that much 

551.08 552.47 A: mhm 

552.22 556.23 B: but i would eat them when he cooked it you know i didn't hate it 

555.95 556.98 A: mhm 

556.83 559.16 B: but he knew it wasn't my favorite thing 

559.91 561.47 B: and um 

561.48 562.46 A: [noise] 

562.12 565.90 B: i think he he makes this spaghetti recipe that he 

565.70 566.92 A: [noise] 

566.13 568.32 B: thinks is wonderful so 

568.94 571.33 B: w- we always eat his spaghetti 

571.48 574.58 A: so the fifty percent was better than having to cook yourself 

573.98 576.82 B: exactly [laughter] yeah yes 

574.95 576.05 A: uh-huh 

576.73 577.91 A: yeah 

578.25 580.16 A: i think my husband has cooked 

581.24 584.94 A: three times maybe four times since we've been married 

584.57 586.29 B: and how long have you been married 

586.11 587.59 A: fourteen years 

587.15 588.61 B: oh 

588.08 596.19 A: [laughter] he just doesn't have the know how or the want to i think he might plead ignorant just because he doesn't want to 

595.76 596.89 B: yeah 

597.13 599.89 B: in my first marriage i was married fourteen years
