121.64 125.89 B: but i c- this last year that i've been here i've come there a lot so i always see her 

126.02 131.85 B: and she's about my age a little bit older than me i'm thirty one she's about thirty four thirty five 

129.22 130.03 A: mhm 

130.63 131.36 A: mhm 

132.22 133.78 B: she's um

142.05 145.95 B: yeah i have two boys and my kids are older than hers 

145.35 148.28 A: well did you oh so your kids really didn't have anything in common 

147.37 150.37 B: right so they don't play together or anything at all 

150.38 155.79 B: um well her first daughter is older than mine and then her youngest is younger than both of mine 

155.99 160.25 B: so our kids don't interact at all but we've been friends for a long time [noise] [noise] [noise] 

159.60 167.01 A: [cough] interestingly enough my um lady friend that um i've had for so long has never married and has no children 

166.88 177.85 A: and let's see she would i think she just turned sixty one i'm fifty three so she was quite a bit older and not really a mentor but just somebody who was just 

177.72 187.44 A: just always so nice and always there and um um kind of a non pressure kind of a friend you know non judgemental non pressure just was willing 

186.53 188.11 B: (( how often do you see her )) 

188.02 198.81 A: i you know what i don't see her that much anymore i just spoke with her today we probably talk at least um we talk once a week maybe i slip into two weeks and i'm the one that has um 

198.81 209.34 A: not been quite as good i've got uh i my kids are grown but i've got grandkids and seemingly always doing something and always busy and and i'm the one that's kind of let that go a little bit 

209.11 210.14 B: (( mm right )) 

209.18 224.14 A: last time i saw her was probably about four uh four months ago or so and i would hate to admit it but i hadn't seen her in almost two years and i don't know if you're familiar with california i live in the riverside moreno valley area and 

222.89 224.84 B: (( yeah i'm very familiar i grew up there )) 

224.77 225.95 A: where'd you go 

225.77 229.67 B: i grew up in hankins beach but i'm very familiar with southern california i've been there all my life 

226.74 227.83 A: oh okay 

229.17 241.48 A: and she lives in whittier so that you know that's pretty sad that just is a state of how busy we all are and how little time you have to devote but we do speak on the phone a lot so it's like we're in constant contact with each other's lives 

230.83 231.57 B: (( mm )) 

241.56 242.55 B: (( right )) 

243.06 245.82 B: well my girlfriend and i used to be in the same business together 

246.28 253.15 B: so that kind of helped because even though we weren't didn't see each other all the time because we both had little kids 

252.47 253.88 A: mhm 

253.56 257.62 B: and it kept us too busy we still talked to each other all the time because we were 

257.87 263.59 B: forced to even if we didn't have anything else you know our friendship stuff to talk about we were still working together 

263.48 267.18 A: you were in the same field or worked in the same at the same business 

264.88 265.96 B: yeah 

266.19 268.33 B: we were in the same field but 

268.68 270.78 B: we also used our 

270.80 274.79 B: clientele off of each other because i had a book business so 

272.24 273.08 A: okay 

275.03 279.22 B: um she worked with sales in the books also 

278.96 281.14 A: okay what kind of business did you have 

280.53 282.04 B: technical books 

281.39 282.68 A: technical okay 

282.79 284.93 B: and i sold books to schools 

284.95 289.98 B: so she got involved in selling in in her area so that was pretty fun 

289.82 293.75 A: did you help each other out or you just had the same common interests 

294.01 296.00 B: no we helped each other out 

296.11 301.16 B: and then we also were like always on the same page when it comes to things like um 

301.42 307.38 B: when she was looking to buy a house we were looking to buy a house so we'd like do all that together 

304.10 305.81 A: oh okay mm 

307.46 311.98 B: and do our research together and things that we were always with 

310.62 312.93 A: has she been able to visit you in washington 

313.12 319.02 B: no not yet but um i've just got settled down up here and we just purchased a hou- a house up here so 

319.96 323.01 B: so now i'm in a situation where she could come visit so 

322.12 323.39 A: whereabouts are you 

323.50 325.05 B: um in tacoma 

324.70 328.44 A: okay tacoma yeah i'm not too familiar with that area i just know that i love the 

328.58 337.04 A: i love the um the uh it's just it's just pretty it's it's pretty are you is it crowded i mean i know seattle has just gotten insane 

332.76 333.77 B: yeah 

337.03 339.45 B: (( right no it's not like seattle at all )) 

339.62 340.74 B: um 

340.80 343.61 B: when i was down there it was 

343.63 347.17 B: it was too much like you know her daughter goes to 

347.49 350.98 B: a public school over there and she lives in uh [mn] 

348.88 349.76 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

352.74 363.20 B: pretty much in santa ana but believe it or not not in the really bad area of santa ana i didn't even know there wasn't a a bad area but apparently she doesn't live in a bad area it seems pretty good but um 

354.07 355.13 A: oh okay 

356.99 358.21 A: yeah 

360.80 362.27 A: [laughter] yeah i 

363.74 368.14 B: but her daughter goes to public school and you know she's constantly having problems and stuff and so 

368.16 373.66 B: my son was five and i wanted to move before he started school before he was going to start 

371.81 372.78 A: (( yeah that )) 

373.73 376.67 B: so i decided i wanted to raise him here uh-huh 

375.95 389.14 A: get him in a different place yeah i don't blame i don't blame you i was born and raised in california and uh [cough] excuse me just the demographics have been incredible it it as a matter of f- as a matter of fact i was born in inglewood so 

382.55 383.39 B: uh-huh 

388.42 390.07 B: (( uh-huh i know where that is )) 

389.35 396.85 A: and it was a [cough] excuse me a totally different kind of area then and then raised in in lakewood so um 

396.93 409.13 A: pretty much lived in different places but all southern california so and my my uh [cough] excuse me my friend was born in minnesota and came here when she was just about ready to start high school 

400.82 402.17 B: (( right [noise] )) 

409.35 414.52 A: so she was very very um we're totally different i mean as far as 

414.65 417.47 A: i'm far more outgoing and far more 

414.85 415.68 B: (( really )) 

417.68 418.70 A: (( [laughter] um )) 

419.02 425.18 A: i don't know just just more open i want to use a word like kind of hip you know even though you're older you can be hip and um 

422.84 423.86 B: mhm 

425.10 439.25 A: she's she's much more reserved raised um good catholic girl good good went to catholic school and and kind of straight the the combination of us is is really interesting it just kinda goes to show when you hit it with somebody and you just really 

439.46 440.35 B: right 

439.84 443.90 A: you know you have that faith so it it's interesting to it's the the um 

443.61 447.47 B: well i had two really really really close girlfriends and they were both 

448.05 452.38 B: well you know one of them i was closer to than the other but they were both twenty years older than me 

452.07 453.09 A: really 

452.79 458.48 B: yeah neither one one of them had fully grown kids and the other one her kids were pretty much grown too so 

458.54 463.34 B: and both of them you know weren't married so that was kind of strange because we were nothing alike 

460.50 461.23 A: mhm 

463.33 464.39 A: well 

463.36 465.08 B: but we were very good friends 

464.64 467.39 A: well for my myself i'd be i'm either 

467.40 470.67 A: a good ten to twelve years older than 

470.93 478.73 A: my other close close friends or i tend to be about eight years younger so i really don't have any contemporaries in my 

472.88 473.64 B: mhm 

479.04 487.54 A: closer age group i guess within eight years is is sort of close but really it isn't when you think about um you know where you were what eight years does make a difference 

487.36 488.76 B: (( right i )) 

487.94 494.35 A: so um yeah kind of the same position that you're in just just kind of a different different age group 

494.91 495.86 B: right 

496.30 504.60 B: i think a lo- big difference with my friends depended on made a difference through my life because of my first husband my first husband was ten years older than me 

502.03 503.00 A: mhm 

504.13 505.24 A: (( oh okay )) 

504.82 507.25 B: and since i was married at seventeen 

506.76 507.68 A: oh [laughter] 

507.47 509.44 B: yeah there was a lot of um 

510.20 513.16 B: [lipsmack] kind of being raised by him in a way 

512.01 520.48 A: that well that made you very comfortable with older people normally a seventeen year old would not hang with a twenty seven year old or wouldn't 

514.56 515.55 B: yeah 

518.76 521.30 B: right so i started to get know 

521.88 526.85 B: you know i knew all his friends and those fr- you know couples and friends and so then 

523.21 524.25 A: mhm 

527.02 528.34 B: it seemed like 

528.35 533.78 B: you know by the time i was in my late mid and late twenties all my friends were much older than me 

533.40 534.36 A: well 

534.58 538.15 A: but don't you think that made you maturer and and kind of 

536.21 538.40 B: right yeah mhm 

538.26 542.94 A: and not only that but to be able to interact with people of different ages 

542.35 544.42 B: right uh-huh yeah 

543.44 546.29 A: i think that's yeah but uh i know when i 

546.28 554.51 A: got out on my own as a [cough] excuse me a single mom i tended to gravitate to older people because i really felt like i could learn something 

554.51 560.32 A: from them and i really wanted to learn something from them so i really went in that direction 

554.63 555.49 B: uh-huh 

560.28 564.55 A: and um not so much men i ended up when i remarried i married um 

564.46 578.86 A: a man that's you know five years my senior which is really no no big deal but um i did go through a dating period where i dated like way out of out of my uh my age group but i've always preferred the the older age it's just that it's it's 

575.72 576.64 B: right 

578.78 590.34 A: just kinda interesting that you try and think of the friends that you have that are your age or closer that you wo- think that you would think you would have more in common with and in fact you may not 

590.14 591.13 B: right 

591.70 594.32 B: yeah i don't have many friends that are my age that i 

594.88 597.96 B: have anything in common with and the ones that 

596.27 597.37 A: mhm 

598.97 599.89 B: [sigh] like are
