0.19 1.33 B: hello 

0.98 3.30 A: hi my name's jeremy 

2.94 4.59 B: hey jeremy i'm rob 

4.47 5.82 A: nice to meet you rob 

5.54 7.52 B: nice to meet you where you calling from 

6.93 8.84 A: (( ah alabama )) 

8.19 10.39 B: okay i'm calling from los angeles 

10.10 11.27 A: oh really 

10.78 11.95 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

11.32 15.62 A: yeah my wife is from california she's from ah seamy valley you know where that is 

14.66 18.64 B: oh i do know where that is indeed up north it's nice up there 

18.18 20.58 A: yep yep that's what she keeps telling me 

19.47 20.03 B: (( [mn] )) 

20.16 22.35 B: yeah so where in alabama 

22.16 25.63 A: uh close to huntsville it's in northern alabama 

24.04 25.06 B: (( oh okay )) 

25.60 27.95 B: sure okay i know where that is [sigh] 

28.42 40.78 A: so the topic of today is food [sigh] and whether i'd prefer to eat out or eat at home see that that's kinda a tricky question 'cause i love to cook myself 

30.87 32.06 B: (( okay all )) 

35.19 36.18 B: right 

40.46 41.57 B: mhm 

40.60 52.68 A: so i love to eat at home but at the same time you know there are times when i just want to go out to eat because you know it's always fun to eat in a like a a newer atmosphere or something like that you know like 

42.52 43.52 B: right 

52.54 54.09 B: sure absolutely 

53.00 60.19 A: you you can't go to i i don't have a mexican theme in my house so you know i can make pahitas here and they're good 

58.91 61.07 B: but its just not quite the same 

60.39 67.12 A: you know but yeah so i like to go out to eat [sigh] but i can't afford to go out to eat all the time 

62.37 63.89 B: (( right i like )) 

66.61 67.67 B: right 

67.07 77.80 A: so i like the i like the atmosphere of going out to eat and i but i also love to cook i mean love to cook but it seems like every time i cook i always end up trying to make some kind of pasta 

77.34 78.54 B: mhm 

77.83 80.86 A: because italian food is really hard to cook [laughter] 

80.35 81.97 B: right 

81.38 88.15 A: and it it's good [sigh] but it it always ends up being more of a mess to have to clean up so 

87.94 97.85 A: i would wager to say that i think i like eating out more than i do eating at home 'cause then at least i don't have to worry about cleaning it all up and you know and i still get the good meal 

88.15 89.38 B: mhm 

94.12 95.83 B: cleaning up afterwards 

97.57 99.07 B: (( [cough] [lipsmack] right )) 

97.80 109.52 A: however you know to cook that same type meal i can make it and i'll have enough to eat it for two to three days but you know i'll end up spending about the same amount as i would if i went out to eat 

109.31 110.18 B: really 

109.88 118.75 A: yeah well when i get you know when we like say we make swedish meat balls at home we'll end up buying enough stuff to make like 

110.55 111.47 B: oh 

115.25 116.28 B: mhm 

118.71 126.12 A: five pounds worth of swedish meat balls so we can eat it for like four or five days between me my wife and out son 

121.26 122.22 B: okay 

125.88 127.08 B: right 

126.44 134.94 A: you know that way it's cheaper to buy in bulk than it is to just buy like one pound of meat when you can buy a big five pound thing and get the discount so 

134.78 136.01 B: right 

135.38 147.08 A: so we end up just usually buying in bulk i'll end up cooking this big grand meal for us all we'll eat it for like two or three days until we're sick of eating the same thing even though it is good food 

138.07 139.02 B: mhm 

145.03 146.01 B: right 

146.33 147.60 B: mhm 

147.42 160.35 A: but on at the same note you know whenever you go out to a restaurant you see the thing is i always get on to my wife because we'll go out to eat and she'll always order the exact same thing off the menu every time [laughter] 

154.98 155.86 B: mhm 

159.77 162.58 B: oh really do you go to the same place every time 

160.56 161.51 A: yeah 

161.90 173.30 A: well no it's just like you know we'll say we go to olive garden she knows exactly what she likes there so rather than experimenting and getting something different she'll just get the same thing she always gets from olive garden 

164.98 165.89 B: mhm 

170.28 171.36 B: right 

173.31 180.78 A: uh you know i'm that way with mexican 'cause you know if we go out to eat no matter where we go for mexican i'm gonna get pahitas 

180.51 181.58 B: right 

180.95 193.24 A: you know but whenever i go somewhere i generally try and get something new every time that way i can experiment broaden my horizons see if i like something more than i i thought i did 

185.43 186.98 B: mhm 

192.80 194.30 B: right 

193.62 197.83 A: you know like i don't know if you go out to eat a lot and i 

196.89 208.94 B: all the time actually i hate i i don't hate to cook i just don't i live by myself so i'm not really motivated to do it very often so like i'll basically make breakfast for myself and the other two meals i'll tend to eat out 

204.03 205.84 A: oh yeah 

208.51 209.96 A: (( yeah )) 

208.98 214.20 B: you know or i'll make something at the studio and which i guess is sort of making making your own food 

214.44 215.90 B: but um 

214.60 216.50 A: in a way it is but you know 

216.14 217.89 B: mhm 

216.97 224.72 A: chances are if you're throwing something toge- ah together at work it's something real quick that you can chances are just nuke 

224.63 225.78 B: right 

225.15 238.29 A: and you know that's not really the same thing i mean in a way it's the same thing but you know it's not the same thing as sitting down and cooking for like three hours trying to flap together this meal with all the sides and all that stuff 

229.46 230.67 B: mhm 

236.89 242.41 B: yeah i probably i don't think i've done that in the last ten years to tell you the truth 

241.83 250.03 A: i just recently started to do it since me and my wife got together 'cause you know i used to could not cook to save my life i would like 

248.99 250.54 B: mhm 

250.07 252.96 A: burn macaroni and cheese [laughter] 

253.00 255.10 B: oh really okay that's 

253.59 262.20 A: yeah i was like horrible and then you know she taught me a couple of things about cooking like step one do not cook meat on high 

259.73 261.47 B: mhm 

262.24 263.47 B: right 

262.79 271.35 A: so you know stuff like that just little pointers and from there you know from that and from you know my mother's advice and my father who also loved to grill out 

271.16 272.08 B: mhm 

271.33 283.14 A: you know from the tricks they te- taught me and what she taught me i started learning to cook more and more and you know i'd generally get online find recipes you know try and cook something new so 

277.41 278.25 B: huh 

283.28 294.34 A: i'm not sure whether it would you know it's such a an honest debate in my head whether i like to cook more at home because i enjoy you know learning how to cook all this stuff 

289.86 290.80 B: mhm 

294.12 295.06 B: wow 

294.24 299.41 A: but i end up trying to cook basically the same thing usually some form of chicken 

297.44 298.80 B: mhm 

299.65 308.55 B: gotcha gotcha well that's amazing man that's really great that you ah you put all you put all that much time into it i'm i'm very impressed with that 

300.41 301.31 A: huh 

306.50 318.63 A: well i- it's more or less the thing of you know as much as i love to do it i think it means more to my wife and my son that i actually put forth all this effort to try and cook a really good meal for them 

314.02 315.65 B: mhm 

316.32 317.29 B: sure 

318.06 319.57 B: oh sure that's 

318.48 327.21 A: so you know it makes me feel good to know that they're happy that i actually did something to try and you know make their day happier and go by quicker and you know 

325.20 326.52 B: (( true mhm )) 

327.03 336.26 A: just a little surprise for them but if i had the money chances are i'd go out to eat a lot chances are i'd eat it out back almost like every night of the week 

329.17 330.33 B: (( oh yeah )) 

332.34 334.76 B: (( [laughter] )) 

335.75 337.60 B: yeah yeah 

336.50 342.12 A: 'cause i'd love those kookaburra wings just cannot not get them 

338.98 340.26 B: (( um )) 

340.94 344.11 B: that's good stuff man that's good stuff 

343.37 349.33 A: got my friend that goes there and everytime he goes there he gets the blooming onion and i'm not a real big onion fan 

349.07 350.10 B: right 

349.10 359.20 A: i like the way onion flavor is like if you cook it with something but i don't like the texture of onions unless like you can cook an onion enough to where it's like 

352.79 354.56 B: mhm 

359.11 369.03 A: you you know almost has no texture it's just real chewy you know and you can't taste it usually if it's boiled in something 

368.68 370.67 B: right 

369.46 373.04 A: [lipsmack] that's about the only way i'll get i'll get my onions you know 

373.12 375.72 A: and usually that's in something like chili 

375.65 380.59 B: ah okay i love onions god i eat them all the time sauteed 

375.82 376.64 A: so 

380.80 383.52 B: over over s- with fish or with steak or 

383.84 386.53 B: yeah onion soup don't like onion soup 

386.11 398.42 A: ah onion soup is okay the flavor of it it's just that i'm not a real big soup person i'm more of a meat eater myself you know you give me a baked potato and a big old steak and i'm happy 

388.44 389.41 B: ah 

394.14 395.78 B: ah i got you 

397.78 399.75 B: that's that's what yeah 

399.65 414.53 B: okay i got ya no i'm kinda the opposite though i eat a lot of japanese food and ah yeah well you know i live in l._a. and it was it was just something completely different than ah what i you know what i grew up with my mother was ah my mother was a cordon blue chef and so 

403.83 405.29 A: oh really now 

413.44 414.61 A: (( oh )) 

414.47 421.90 B: i know you know like and um things like that were like big thick meaty sorts of stuff and [sigh] 

421.99 427.94 B: i don't know it's just it's just different and it's it's new and since you know i'm new in town and i'm just experimenting it ah 

428.37 432.57 B: (( [lipsmack] it ah it makes it it makes it easier you know 'cause )) 

431.65 436.66 A: understandable you know everytime some new place opens up in town here i have to go try it 

436.20 437.19 B: sure 

436.47 447.63 A: just can't you know especially if it's a new type of food like i just moved from a city called decatur to this city scotsborough because ah my wife got promoted got a bigger store 

439.87 441.01 B: mhm 

442.49 443.72 B: mhm 

444.43 445.62 B: right 

447.34 448.77 B: oh that's cool 

448.19 454.12 A: and ah when we moved out here like decatur has a population of around like fifty sixty thousand people 

453.75 454.83 B: right 

454.19 469.06 A: and then we moved to here which has a population of like fifteen thousand so you know i had a wider variety of food places in decatur but now that i've moved here you know you're stuck with like barbeque mexican or you know 

458.04 459.14 B: mhm 

464.57 466.30 B: mhm 

467.57 468.60 B: ah 

468.76 470.15 B: or the chains 

469.67 478.44 A: yeah so you know ch- you know if we want something good to eat you know that's like different we have to go to huntsville which is about forty minutes away 

470.21 471.28 B: yeah 

478.17 479.78 B: wow okay 

479.27 482.14 A: you know thirty to forty depending on how fast you drive 

481.91 482.83 B: wow 

482.44 492.70 A: but you know i like to go to huntsville a lot 'cause they have like sushi bars thai food mexican food japanese food chinese food italian food you know 

487.54 488.42 B: mhm 

491.58 492.51 B: wow 

492.72 495.79 A: just about anything you can think of because 

495.97 497.72 A: huntsville is like the ah 

498.06 504.41 A: big conglomeration i guess in the north of alabama it's the biggest city around so 

502.00 502.99 B: mhm 

503.62 505.17 B: right 

504.65 510.75 A: i think it has a lot to do with the fact that they've got a the boeing space and rocket center there 

510.61 512.26 B: oh that's right okay 

511.02 523.19 A: plus a redstone arsenal and you know so everything grew around that so i go there a lot but chances are hm i like to eat a lot of italian a lot of chicken

523.37 525.86 A: butter lot of spaghetti [laughter] 

525.67 529.43 B: yeah i do eat a lot of spaghetti that's something i'll make at home yeah 

528.18 532.76 A: that's 'cause that's easy to make man just get some sauce throw some meat up in there

533.55 535.08 A: boil some noodles 

536.51 550.71 A: could be a lot harder things to make like not too long ago i tried to make a cannelloni don't know if you know what that is it's basically take pasta cook some flavor some meat you know the way they told me to and you roll it up and ah 

541.98 542.95 B: ah

547.23 549.72 B: mhm mhm 

550.83 564.94 A: i had never actually tried to make homemade pasta before and then i tried it and they were all like this whole recipe including making the pasta will take you around four hours it was like well that ain't too bad you know i could start around two we'll eat around six 

554.56 555.51 B: mhm 

563.45 565.28 B: mhm 

564.86 571.84 A: i didn't end up getting done until nine o'clock at night because i had never made pasta before 

568.04 569.02 B: wow 

570.51 575.76 B: [laughter] the kids were screaming at you wondering where the food was and yeah 

574.21 583.39 A: you know i basically had to feed the children and send them you know not a whole meal just enough to get them by and then told them you know go l- go ahead and go lay down for bed 

583.19 593.17 A: you know i'll wake you up in an hour when dinner is ready ha then we'll eat you can sit up for a little bit more i know that you know it'll be up past your bed time but i'm sorry i didn't know 

583.35 584.20 B: mhm
