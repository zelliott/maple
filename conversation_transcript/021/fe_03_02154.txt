263.15 269.78 A: uh it's very simple i think pretty much it's just the uh uh juices run together 

269.79 270.75 B: oh wow huh 

271.35 274.59 A: yeah and so you provide your own uh ketchup whatever you know

276.03 280.07 B: so do you do you so do you eat them with uh with a condiment then you 

279.86 281.58 A: yeah you tend to yeah 

280.46 281.62 B: you prefer to put 

281.94 284.33 B: so they're pretty bland then by themselves 

284.10 295.09 A: yeah there is a place here in madison that also makes them and they do uh a number of different flavors of them so they put in spices but generally the ones you buy in the store are not spiced 

292.25 293.16 B: okay 

295.00 298.17 B: right so it's just uh what is it ham or beef or

303.80 310.67 B: that's cool well i'll have to i'll have to look in uh i'll have to look and see about that pasties pasties 

310.86 314.99 B: so is that the correct uh the correct pronunciation is pasties 

315.12 321.14 A: um there is a great deal of controversy about that and it can be pronounced both ways [laughter] 

321.02 322.90 B: okay huh 

322.99 329.12 B: which is the uh wh- which school of thought are you at are you currently in i guess the pasty 

327.68 331.26 A: oh i i use the short a myself [laughter] 

330.44 334.67 B: okay [laughter] interesting [laughter] 

334.97 340.97 B: interesting that's why i um i think my uh my favorite type of dinner like that would be a uh a 

341.08 345.05 B: recounter's pot pie it it's a more sophisticated pot pie 

344.98 347.24 A: a sophisticated pot pie 

345.30 346.51 B: the um 

347.12 354.30 B: yes i would say so i would say that it's it's quite sophisticated [laughter] but uh it's uh it's um 

348.57 349.84 A: oh really 

354.56 358.42 B: well you know your typical uh swanson pot pie is uh 

358.80 361.40 B: you know it- it's pretty short it's like an inch high 

361.21 362.16 A: yeah 

361.58 371.56 B: uh not a lot of not a lot of substance to it th- the crust is made out of some pretty cheap stuff um but the recounter's version they cost uh they cost about three bucks 

371.80 372.91 B: um 

373.38 378.80 B: and they use some very good ingredients fresh vegetables um you can 

378.86 385.13 B: you know you can actually crunch if there's broccoli in it y- you can crunch the broccoli or the carrots it's pretty good 

384.88 385.99 A: (( oh [noise] )) 

385.33 390.17 B: and um actually they used to use uh sherry in their sauce 

390.42 402.00 B: um which was pretty cool but i think they stopped doing that uh for some reason or another probably uh [laughter] probably due to economic restrictions of some type 

401.35 402.66 A: yeah i suppose 

402.83 404.74 B: yeah i've been eating those uh 

404.93 406.79 B: eating those since i was a tyke 

408.50 409.64 B: (( but uh )) 

409.67 411.93 B: what about uh international food then 

415.46 418.48 A: uh what about international food 

417.49 420.93 B: yeah what uh what type of uh international food to you like there 

420.91 435.08 A: [laughter] well when i was in zambia last june um i really did like their uh meat dishes there now mind you the normal zambian doesn't get to eat meat a lot [laughter] 

429.77 430.67 B: okay 

434.13 435.54 B: right 

435.22 437.20 A: (( they eat nsima )) 

437.52 438.85 A: over there 

438.87 447.17 A: and that is just um ground up corn basically corn meal that's been boiled with water until it's so stiff you can't stir it any more 

446.84 448.22 B: (( okay really )) 

447.71 451.82 A: that's when they know it's done [laughter] and that's used as your spoon 

449.63 450.57 B: okay 

452.71 453.71 B: really 

454.32 456.51 A: believe it or not [laughter] 

455.54 456.37 B: huh 

457.03 464.69 A: and so you have the nsima and some kind of sauce or something to dip it in because nsima itself doesn't taste like hardly anything 

457.17 458.07 B: and then 

464.76 465.62 B: okay 

464.92 476.65 A: but you know then they have uh some meat or uh some vegetables or something like this and uh you dip the nsima in that and eat the nsima with dipped and uh actually it came up quite good with meat sauce 

477.07 478.50 B: (( wow so )) 

478.09 484.89 A: [laughter] their spicing over there is uh fairly moderate and uh quite good by my taste 

485.93 489.62 B: so it's it's just corn meal it's it's corn meal that they boil 

489.46 490.90 A: yep that's it 

489.71 492.36 B: or it's just corn okay corn meal 

492.09 493.24 A: yep 

492.75 495.07 B: and they just boil it until it's uh 

495.61 496.33 B: huh 

496.60 502.18 B: well th- an- and so it's do they dry it before they give it to you is is it dry when you uh 

501.13 502.03 A: no 

502.05 506.96 A: uh-uh it's hot and uh a little bit sticky and very stiff 

507.06 509.04 B: okay and so you 

507.42 511.29 A: if not then y- you don't use spoons and knives over there mind you 

511.38 512.25 B: right 

511.40 521.52 A: so the nsima is your spoon [laughter] so you pick up a globule with your right hand squish it around until you've got a spoonish like shape and then use it 

514.25 515.17 B: hm 

520.04 520.81 B: (( oh )) 

521.54 524.07 B: so it's so it's malleable then huh 

523.22 525.13 A: yeah it's quite malleable 

525.00 529.13 B: wow can you find that uh do you think in any uh 

529.24 532.01 B: uh ethnic restaurants do you think 

532.39 534.73 A: um i don't think so uh 

532.49 533.62 B: (( or do you )) 

534.18 534.88 B: huh 

534.91 538.77 A: for people in the united states uh we gotta use spoons 

539.20 540.04 B: right 

539.41 541.24 A: you know [laughter] what i mean 

541.34 542.60 B: [laughter] 

541.70 544.18 A: you wouldn't want it th- they won't do it that way 

544.30 549.12 A: it would be very difficult to get people to eat nsima correctly in the united states 

544.55 545.36 B: right 

548.11 553.49 B: i'm sure too it'd probably violate a whole host of health codes [laughter] 

552.90 555.44 A: um well maybe maybe not [laughter] 

555.76 559.36 B: depending on how you how you grab the the nsima then 

559.55 563.02 B: huh that's interesting so where um 

560.42 561.59 A: (( hm yep )) 

563.07 566.81 B: where else did you travel did you travel anywhere else in africa while you were there 

567.13 570.26 A: um well only uh making 

570.62 576.64 A: connections on the airlines so i actually was in south africa also 

576.64 577.52 B: okay 

576.98 581.09 A: to uh make connections there and we had a 

581.23 590.10 A: what was it four hour lay over so we actually got to kind of wander around a little bit but not a lot um and also we had an eight hour lay over in london 

586.78 587.44 B: (( okay )) 

590.30 594.82 A: so that was cool got to go to a london pub and everything else like that 

590.68 591.41 B: huh 

594.66 599.95 B: oh yeah how how long ago was that 'cause actually i i haven't gotten to get overseas uh quite yet
