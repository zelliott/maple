271.12 272.04 A: (( mhm )) 

272.34 283.01 B: i would say i have quite a few friends and i think a lot of people i- it's interesting to hear your perspective about people moving out of the pittsburgh area 

283.39 294.48 B: because around here i was born right in this area i have lived here my entire life i have i'm still in contact with the girl i grew up next door to we've been friends for thirty five years now 

288.54 289.11 A: (( [noise] )) 

292.30 293.33 A: really 

294.90 305.51 B: and i have several long time friends sixteen seventeen years um but it seems that people at least the people i know don't move out of this area 

305.32 307.11 A: really they stay 

306.54 313.82 B: yeah they stay and i went through you know school with all the same people and went to the university of washington and 

311.18 312.18 A: mhm 

313.84 326.05 B: i still stay in contact with people i've known my whole life and then i'm continuing to make new friends because we have a three year old so that always opens up a lot of opportunities to meet other parents and other moms 

321.74 322.85 A: (( ooh [laughter] )) 

323.50 324.10 A: (( [mn] )) 

326.10 335.04 B: especially being a stay at home mom i have a lot of time to go to the park and do lots of stuff with her so we meet a lot of other stay at home moms 

327.99 329.04 A: yeah 

334.32 335.73 A: (( yeah )) 

335.23 337.48 B: so i would say i have um 

337.52 351.15 B: it's kinda hard really to to keep up with everybody and that's why mark my husband and i were talking the other night saying we should have a big party and have everybody here [noise] because we yeah exactly because it's really starting to get nice outside 

346.01 347.75 A: yeah for the summer 

351.09 361.65 B: that way we could see at least everybody all in one place because if we just pick one couple a weekend then we are going to see people maybe twice over the course of the whole summer 

354.42 355.49 A: (( mhm )) 

361.61 362.92 A: yeah 

361.93 362.82 B: (( [lipsmack] so ))

420.02 421.29 B: yeah 

430.33 432.33 B: oh yeah seattle is one of 

431.24 432.90 A: because of the war 

432.89 438.12 B: the war the economy it it seattle has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country 

437.99 441.19 A: really i think it's because of those dotcoms 

438.66 440.56 B: yeah because there's so many 

441.29 445.90 B: i now it is because there were so there's a lot of very wealthy people out here 

441.96 442.72 A: [laughter] 

445.68 446.76 A: (( mhm )) 

446.02 460.06 B: and there's a lot of dotcom companies a lot of people have computer science or computer information or information system degrees and so so many people were laid off when the dotcoms went under including several of my friends 

453.12 454.41 A: yeah 

460.14 465.98 B: and some of them are still unemployed and cannot get a job in the computer industry because they're n- nobody's hiring

493.07 497.36 A: i mean if you're on unemployment you'll get a job if they see that you're on unemployment 

497.90 504.01 A: you'll get calls from people offering you a job and it might pay less than you made but you have to take it 

503.74 505.38 B: (( [mn] ah [noise] uh-huh ))

544.01 545.56 A: yeah and i do 

546.29 557.00 A: yeah and that's i guess that's maybe why they don't want to hire [laughter] anybody because there we there's a lot of temporary people there and we're just all frustrated because they won't hire us 

550.28 551.98 B: (( ah ))
