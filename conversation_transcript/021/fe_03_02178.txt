388.61 389.91 B: you're done 

389.97 392.38 B: buying everything you need for a good meal [laughter] 

392.87 399.96 A: i know and everyone's like hey it's much cheaper if you make your own food but then there's like all this clean up to do and how can you clean up with having had a kid screaming and 

398.80 410.27 B: sometimes it is but see we only have a family of three so we could go to sam's club and they do have good food and the prices are cheap but sometimes it's too much just for a couple of people 

410.59 421.49 A: hm yeah [sigh] i mean uh you know she's not it's she's like only a just a little baby but she's like about six months old and just being with all the time is just oh man she wants everything

445.08 447.24 B: well see that's good but 

447.65 450.81 B: sometimes you can't really burden your family all the time [laughter] 

451.44 452.55 A: oh i know 

452.72 456.10 A: [sigh] like if i need her to watch her she will but usually it's just oh 

455.69 458.14 B: well it's nice that you have some help though 

458.02 460.65 A: yeah it's nice to have 

460.90 466.37 B: do you ever cook at home at all like when going out gets too expensive and what do you like to make at home
