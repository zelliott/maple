2.70 5.08 B: oh hi this is laurie 

5.22 6.22 A: (( are you )) 

5.97 8.36 B: good um w- i'm from atlanta 

8.27 10.37 A: (( oh okay i'm in new york )) 

9.79 11.36 B: oh okay that's great 

11.24 12.03 A: yeah 

11.38 12.28 B: um 

13.04 18.72 A: so uh so so i guess this is for restaurant or uh at home 

17.51 18.54 B: mhm 

18.79 20.15 A: so what do you prefer 

20.30 30.10 B: um i always like to go to restaurants um i mean it's really more expensive and i you know i realize that but if i had um you know 

30.39 36.61 B: the as much money as i wanted to spend i would eat out every single night i really would [laughter] 

36.85 37.94 B: how 'bout you 

37.91 44.35 A: yeah uh actually i'd rather um [sigh] eat at home because you know what's 

44.38 46.64 A: in the food [laughter] 

45.60 47.42 B: (( [laughter] oh [laughter] )) 

46.68 51.46 A: you know i you know exactly what you put in and exactly how much 

51.66 54.50 A: fat or whatever that you uh you know put 

55.22 58.96 A: in [sigh] but um if you go to a restaurant i don't know what they 

59.07 60.70 A: put in so uh 

61.23 74.22 A: that's kind of like actually i have a very good example the other day over the weekend i uh went to a restaurant i ate out and [sigh] my stomach bothered me all night [sigh] so 

74.44 82.75 A: that so i don't know what was in that thing uh they don't give you the full detail in a restaurant of what- whatever you know spices or whatever they put in 

76.40 77.74 B: [laughter] 

82.70 83.71 B: mhm 

82.93 85.31 A: (( so you know i like to )) 

85.56 92.82 A: cook at home and eat of course i love cooking so that may be uh just me but uh [laughter] you 

91.81 93.41 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

93.95 95.11 A: know so 

94.84 101.39 B: well you're right about that 'cause you really don't know what they're putting in it and actually you don't know 

101.31 110.08 B: who's cooking it if they're you know they could have a cold or something worse but yeah it's [laughter] but you know um 

106.24 107.24 A: right 

109.17 110.80 A: (( right )) 

110.02 116.13 B: i i mean i guess what i try to do is go to places that have been good in the past and so 

115.95 121.40 B: i tend to you know have a good expectation of those places but [sigh] 

121.31 132.38 B: um but you're right i've had experiences like that too occasionally and then you're hear the really bad stories sometimes in the newspaper [sigh] somebody really getting a food poisoning experience so 

132.48 133.68 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

132.54 138.03 B: um there's definite advantages to eating at home i agree with you [laughter] 

137.92 152.33 B: but also i mean one of the things i don't like to clean up that much and once you kind of get that into a rhythm it's not so bad but that's the worst part for me if i could have somebody clean it all up i could get real creative in the kitchen so 

151.86 160.52 A: right yeah that yeah that i like cl- i i hate cleaning when i'm done with cooking too [laughter] but 

159.55 160.98 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

160.57 175.11 A: i i li- i love the cooking part so you know to do that uh i i have to you know sacrifice [sigh] cleaning and then i i you know i just clean after i have done cooking [sigh] so uh 

176.08 180.90 A: (( you know i like to cook that's why [sigh] you know i- it doesn't [sigh] )) 

181.27 184.05 A: (( seem much of a hassle after )) 

184.50 188.37 A: you know you're done so the cleaning part is not 

185.53 187.19 B: (( mhm mhm well )) 

189.33 192.24 B: that's good you've got a good attitude 

189.42 190.88 A: (( it doesn't not so )) 

191.84 193.15 A: [laughter] 

192.50 201.60 B: no really 'cause that's part of the that's my block you know is that i'll say oh i just don't want to deal with this and i'll you know i'll even kind of 

201.76 204.50 B: rationalize it by saying well 

204.35 217.83 B: you know i know this costs a lot of money to go out to eat but if i was heating the stove and i was running the water all this would cost some more and it's really not true 'cause it's like three times the price to go out you know 

207.81 208.64 A: yeah 

216.20 220.57 A: oh yeah sometimes even more if you know it depends where you go so 

219.76 226.72 B: yeah i'm talking about just your moderate priced places like you know red lobster [laughter] [laughter] 

223.89 226.95 A: hm right right right 

226.91 232.77 B: um but that's the hardest thing for me is just getting it all together and cleaning it up and 

232.63 242.70 B: you know i don't know i need to start doing it again but i guess what's happened is i've been to some of the really nicest restaurants in atlanta and you can get spoiled i mean um 

242.57 254.25 B: you know where it's like every course is really it's more like the presentation than the food so you think you know wow and that's really part of it the whole psychological experience of the 

247.75 249.58 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

254.18 262.69 B: room and the waiters and the whole thing and you can really get very into that i mean it's more about that than the food 

262.54 268.72 B: so that's kind of the secret and the really nice restaurants realize that's what brings you back [sigh] 

268.42 269.81 A: (( right okay )) 

268.50 272.05 B: so yeah i think that was the second question they asked what was your 

271.90 286.90 B: what's like a perfect meal and i guess that would be uh like at one of those really really upscale four star restaurants [laughter] you know just to have everything really not i don't like quantity like some of these restaurants now give you too much food 

286.66 298.00 B: but it's just in small beautiful arranged kind of you know proportions and i like seafood which is not something i cook a lot at home so it would probably be something like in a seafood plate yeah 

286.76 288.62 A: (( yeah )) 

290.24 292.06 A: right 

297.99 299.02 A: (( oh okay )) 

299.06 308.23 A: yeah i like i like a nice um my perfect would be like a nice juicy uh steak or something [laughter] with potatoes or whatever [sigh] 

305.91 307.28 B: mhm 

308.42 319.51 A: but uh yeah that's 'bout it but that's occasionally that you know otherwise you can't eat that every day you know it's like killing yourself but uh [laughter] you 

314.56 315.66 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

318.23 320.36 B: [laughter] that's right [laughter] mhm 

319.86 325.39 A: know but now these days are coming up with steamed stuff like steamed vegetables or uh 

325.53 330.83 A: (( for healthy cooking so uh i don't know how often you eat out )) 

331.62 332.63 B: um 

333.11 338.22 B: well let me think [laughter] almost every day for lunch i eat out so 

337.48 338.65 A: oh okay 

338.16 351.09 B: yeah and sometimes breakfast too but i've kind of cut back on that and tried but i don't eat m- i try to eat my main meal at lunch and have something light at home for dinner if i even eat that 

346.63 348.33 A: mhm 

351.07 356.32 B: um i don't i didn't come from that kind of background but i think it's the most but you know 

356.24 360.31 B: normal thing to do is to have your main meal in the middle 

360.21 369.24 B: but i came from a family who they were like regimented and wanted to eat at six thirty every night by then i was already [sigh] just famished you know i 

369.11 383.09 B: and it wasn't a good way to to remember my childhood so [laughter] i don't do that to myself now that i'm grown up i try to eat just you know when i'm hungry usually before way before six thirty [laughter] but yeah so 

380.88 382.10 A: mm oh okay 

382.87 389.70 A: yeah that's a good idea that's what i like to do i like to like eat a big lunch and then very small dinner 

389.13 390.11 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

389.72 395.77 A: so you know you you know you usually you don't like go after dinner y- you uh you know 

395.84 404.42 A: uh stay home and then you go to sleep after that so it doesn't [sigh] uh dissolve after l- for lunch it is you- you're still working 

404.17 405.24 B: yeah 

404.59 408.25 A: and then you're still moving around so that you get uh 

408.55 412.50 A: (( you know you get that lunch uh pretty uh um uh )) 

413.67 416.45 A: get into your uh system so 

415.70 417.26 B: (( yeah right )) 

416.55 424.75 A: you don't have to worry about that but uh for dinner if you eat a very heavy dinner then you go to sleep and then it stays there and then you you know 

424.92 426.64 A: you get sick or whatever 

426.26 427.77 B: mhm 

426.86 432.17 A: but uh you know that's a good thing to do is to eat big lunch and then a small dinner 

432.06 433.16 B: yeah 

432.46 433.87 A: (( that's what i think you know mhm )) 

433.50 435.10 B: yeah i think so too 

435.47 447.69 B: um well you know i live in the south and there's still a lot of that fried southern cooking here so i've tried to avoid that because it gets into you you know you could start eating that all the time 

447.59 457.44 B: for a while i went vegetarian but that hasn't worked out real well 'cause i just seem to need more protein so i just wasn't getting enough i just couldn't do it 

457.64 470.01 B: so um you know i said i tried to eat um i really have sworn off the fried 'cause everything is like i go yeah chicken sandwiches are just so big here and they're always fried well they have some grilled but 

469.93 481.42 B: most of it's fried and it's it's awful and eating out you know some of it is just terrible the look i don't know wendy's is really bad and uh yeah 

479.61 483.87 A: mhm yeah burger king mcdonalds and all that 

482.93 487.14 B: i've done it though i've gotten desperate enough to actually get that stuff 

486.73 490.37 A: yeah oh yeah that stuff is very bad 

487.59 488.58 B: yeah 

489.21 499.01 B: gross it's uh i'm not doing it any more i just swore off of it and i don't know if you well you probably have uh it's a place called schlotzky's is that in new york 

498.92 502.19 A: um it sounds familiar but i'm not sure 

501.78 507.31 B: okay it's kind of a i mean it's not a real deli they call themselves a deli but it's a chain 

507.10 508.81 A: mhm 

507.18 516.51 B: and it's just i couldn't believe it i ordered something there it was like child size it was so tiny [sigh] and it was so expensive and i'm still mad about it so 

512.87 513.73 A: oh 

515.74 516.92 A: [laughter] 

516.29 522.29 B: i mean it's either like you get these huge amounts or you get nothing it doesn't make any sense 

521.99 523.71 A: right 

522.46 535.41 B: so it's hard but i eat a lot at chinese restaurants because you know i feel like it's a good balance and different ethnic kind of restaurants because at least i feel like it's sauteed and it's a little bit less 

535.52 538.21 A: do you have uh subways in atlanta 

535.72 536.67 B: of fat 

537.98 539.09 B: do i have what 

538.59 539.54 A: subway 

539.86 541.36 A: subway restaurants 

541.25 542.81 B: um what's it called 

542.70 543.75 A: subway 

543.40 545.69 B: oh yeah yeah we do we do 

544.91 549.57 A: yeah that's uh i think that's now a new kind of uh healthy cooking 

549.71 554.92 A: they have uh you know different stuff but it's supposed to be supposedly 

555.01 556.82 A: uh very healthy stuff 

556.70 557.86 B: yeah 

556.99 562.57 A: so it's like alternative to mcdonalds or uh burger king or wendy's or something you know 

561.66 563.53 B: right right 

562.91 563.78 A: so 

564.10 568.85 A: that i like that sometimes i get that and uh so you 

568.16 569.30 B: yeah 

569.23 570.60 A: know instead of going to 

570.73 573.14 A: get that fried burger or something 

572.23 579.51 B: [laughter] i know they even have that guy gerard on t._v. he lost all that weight from subway 

579.58 580.57 B: and that's 

579.76 581.22 A: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

580.61 589.83 B: i believe he could you know 'cause if you just keep your portions to a certain amount and at least their bread at subway is better 'cause it's 

589.03 592.07 A: mhm right that's uh fresh bread and 

590.15 591.11 B: (( better mhm )) 

592.42 599.14 A: uh you know if you go to mcdonalds it's like uh like they are frying everything 

599.33 599.89 A: uh
