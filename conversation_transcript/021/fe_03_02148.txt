216.64 218.15 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

217.27 217.83 A: (( [mn] )) 

217.85 223.18 A: very just like small portions and very just weird

228.68 236.35 B: beckley i don't know if you have been near it but it's a very small city it's ah we're south of charleston which is the capital of west virginia 

236.22 243.94 B: and even there there isn't i guess maybe one of the biggest ones is the the italian restaurant i can't think of the name of it ah olive garden 

236.48 237.89 A: (( okay [lipsmack] )) 

243.81 246.34 A: okay i don't like it there that much

272.85 277.85 B: mhm [noise] yeah i'm more into sweets i think but as far as food [sigh] ah 

277.95 280.78 B: i just think it tastes better at home unless [noise] it's a you know 

280.92 291.24 B: unless it's a place i'm really looking forward to going like one time i went to the rainforest [sigh] caf ah the mall of america [sigh] and that was delicious but the portions were huge 

281.04 282.47 A: (( [noise] right )) 

291.16 292.97 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

291.24 296.86 B: like two great big pork chops and just piles of just you know just too much nobody can eat all that 

297.17 302.54 A: [sigh] well sometimes the portions are so huge and then other times the portions are like so small 

302.62 312.76 B: and it's just a waste isn't it if you really i mean i like to buy ah we go to the cheesecake factory we buy one meal [sigh] and split it and it's it's not because we're cheap but we just know we're not going to be able to eat two of them 

308.53 310.38 A: mhm

469.04 472.68 B: well we have this little cheap restaurants like taco bell 

472.87 487.67 B: ah i think i prefer to cook something like that at home because it's [noise] so well it's such a cheap food to fix because i would hate to pay those big dollars to go out and buy it when i know i can make it at home [sigh] with just a taco bell kit or you know any of the other brands at the stores 

472.88 473.78 A: (( [mn] okay )) 

487.61 498.84 A: [noise] [sigh] well when you make like when you make food at home you're making food for your whole family right [lipsmack] so that's i guess the difference 'cause i live by myself so 

492.26 493.77 B: (( right uh-huh [noise] )) 

498.74 500.42 B: right 

498.87 507.75 A: [noise] it's not that much of a hassle like for me to make myself food but you have to like make [noise] you know food for like a house full of people [noise] 

507.17 519.02 B: [noise] [sigh] but the difference right [noise] just one person sometimes i think it's cheaper to eat out you know especially if you get to the lunch buffet and things like that but ah when you have several people in your family it adds up [noise] 

515.58 516.38 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

519.63 520.60 A: right 

520.65 521.34 B: (( so )) 

520.75 523.89 A: have you ever been to new york like the [noise] city

526.12 532.50 B: when we went up north canada a couple of times but i've never [sigh] ah we we saw the brooklyn bridge and we got lost in ah 

532.68 536.21 B: new brooklyn that area one time got scared to death 

536.46 544.34 B: [sigh] and ah that my husband never would take me downtown because he said the traffic was too bad and i always wanted to see what the high rise buildings looked like 

543.98 545.93 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

544.61 548.51 B: i think it would be fantastic just to get to walk on the main street and look up

570.10 573.47 B: oh i i think you're lucky i've always wanted to go there but ah 

574.02 584.51 B: i guess the only way to ever go is to like to ride a [noise] train or something and i wouldn't have to worry about parking 'cause we could not navigate the big city we've just got two lane roads up here [laughter] [sigh] 

583.84 594.41 A: [noise] yeah i um i take the train [noise] into the city [noise] every day [sigh] 'cause like i'm at work right now so [noise] i take the city [laughter] i don't
