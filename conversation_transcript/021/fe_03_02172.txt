489.67 490.46 B: right 

492.35 493.69 B: exactly 

493.06 495.17 A: you know but if they do 

495.09 503.31 A: you know th- and they're successful that way that's a better way to be successful with eating you know different types of foods [sigh] because 

503.14 510.70 A: some people if you change it all at once it'll work for a little while but then they're right back to the same grind you know [sigh] 

504.50 505.08 B: (( [cough] ))

535.32 536.50 A: right 

537.24 538.20 A: right
