4.84 6.24 B: how are you 

5.50 10.74 A: [noise] good [sigh] so do you like eating in a restaurant or do you like eating at home [noise] 

6.86 7.78 B: good [noise] 

9.77 17.82 B: um [noise] i like both i mean i think eating at a restaurant is easier 'cause you just kinda go and sit and they [laughter] bring you food 

17.24 20.55 A: yeah i will eat anywhere where i don't have to cook it [laughter] 

19.93 29.88 B: [laughter] yeah [sigh] but i like cooking too i mean it's fun like as an activity and stuff [sigh] but it's definitely much [noise] more [noise] of a production 

23.32 25.52 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

29.80 35.77 A: oh [sigh] well i i don't mind cooking it's the cleaning i don't p- particularly care for 

33.65 38.93 B: [noise] yeah [noise] it's the cleaning [noise] and all the m- yeah [laughter] 

36.44 37.42 A: you know 

38.00 49.73 A: [sigh] and then you gotta do the dishes and you gotta clean the table and blah blah blah [sigh] so it's definitely nicer to go just to go to a restaurant [sigh] and not a fast food restaurant but you know one where you can 

39.87 41.47 B: (( and [noise] the dishes [noise] )) 

42.55 43.59 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

47.94 50.20 B: (( [noise] [noise] n- no but nice [noise] )) 

49.62 54.28 A: sit down and just order your meal and have them bring it to you [sigh] um 

52.51 56.65 B: yeah and [noise] have a glass of wine with it [laughter] [noise] 

55.35 68.29 A: yeah well you know we've got two small ones here so it's not too often that we actually [sigh] could have a glass of wine and it's not too often that we have a quiet meal with just ah [sigh] my husband and myself we usually have to bring the kids with us 

67.78 69.69 B: oh [laughter] [noise] 

68.63 82.24 A: so a perfect meal would probably have to be ah one without the kids where we could you know actually hear ourselves talk and not ah [sigh] not be yelling at [laughter] back and forth 

75.83 77.47 B: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] yeah )) 

79.11 81.11 B: [laughter] 

82.04 89.60 A: sit down don't touch that use your fork [sigh] get back in your chair [laughter] that kinda thing but um [mn] 

84.59 86.27 B: [laughter] 

86.49 88.71 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] [mn] )) 

89.74 95.78 A: we do go out to eat [noise] a couple of nights a week um [noise] because i really just [noise] d- d- 

95.13 101.35 B: well i can imagine with the kids you don't have much time left for cooking [laughter] and all that 

98.59 99.31 A: (( [sigh] )) 

99.73 103.19 A: yeah yeah i mean e- well even if i do cook 

102.98 109.58 A: then [sigh] you know there's a whole another hour's worth of cleaning that is involved you know so [sigh] 

106.78 108.03 B: yeah 

109.02 110.07 B: (( yes )) 

109.37 121.50 A: it definitely is easier if we can um go out so i mean sometimes we will go out to a restaurant where we can actually sit down and sometimes it's just you know sandwiches somewhere [sigh] so um but ah 

119.04 120.27 B: yeah 

120.58 123.06 B: but it is definitely easier 

122.52 124.94 A: yeah yeah we definitely ah 

125.29 134.22 A: definitely like to go out to eat [sigh] and ah especially in the weekends um [sigh] [mn] you know in the weekends i really don't like to do much of anything [sigh] 

127.41 128.45 B: yeah 

134.16 138.09 B: (( yeah [mn] no [noise] [laughter] it's ah [laughter] interesting )) 

134.47 136.06 A: and ah [sigh] 

136.43 139.83 A: so if i c- if i can get away without cooking i will [sigh] 

139.69 150.95 B: yeah yeah cooking is nice when you have like lots of time [noise] and you can [sigh] get in- involved in it and you can do [noise] you know a little bit of experimenting and [lipsmack] 

140.27 141.47 A: but um 

151.10 156.09 B: and stuff like that but yeah when you don't have [noise] time it's just not fun [sigh] 

155.77 164.01 A: [sigh] [sigh] well it's a chore i mean you know i i and i don't know that my husband actually sees it that way [sigh] i mean you know he he 

162.69 166.48 B: no he thinks it just magically appears [laughter] 

164.86 166.49 A: yeah you know 

166.45 180.19 A: what are we having for dinner well [laughter] ah you know it's three o'clock i don't know i haven't had a chance to think about it you know [sigh] i mean he doesn't realise that you know it actually takes [sigh] almost all day to get a meal on the table at dinner 

168.95 169.93 B: [laughter] 

179.24 182.20 B: [laughter] it does yeah it does take all day 

180.10 187.70 A: you know especially when you have two kids because you have to first in the morning you have to decide what you're gonna have [sigh] and then you've got to figure out the ah 

185.45 188.22 B: yeah and then you have to shop 

187.64 196.56 A: yeah and then well if you don't even if you don't have to shop if you have to take something out of the freezer then you've got to wait for it to thaw and all that [sigh] but then you [sigh] y- 

193.68 205.38 B: mhm [sigh] oh and then trying to like plan a full meal that always befuddles me 'cause i can make one thing i mean i can like put something together and i can spend a couple of hours doing that and that's fun [sigh] 

197.98 198.86 A: yeah 

204.70 207.73 A: [noise] [sigh] yeah but there's always got to be side dishes 

205.21 217.15 B: but trying to plan like a main course and side dishes and [sigh] like soup or salad and then dessert and i'm like oh my god wh- you need like a week to just [laughter] do all that 

216.09 227.79 A: [noise] well yeah i mean my husband just thinks you know i don't know whether he thinks it's just like a- a little a few minutes to get something on the table i don't think he realizes that it it 

225.70 230.48 B: [sigh] [noise] yeah you think you just turn the oven on and throw it in [laughter] 

228.95 242.16 A: yeah that it literally takes all day you know to do something and and he'll say to me well you know it's not like you have to stand over the stove and stir it for three hours no but you no but you have to be 

231.29 231.85 B: (( [sigh] )) 

231.87 235.20 B: it does it does and 

238.78 240.35 B: you're like yes i 

242.63 245.42 A: close by i mean [noise] 

242.67 249.97 B: [laughter] and you do it's like you literally d- you can't walk away from it because the minute you walk away from it it'll burn [mn] 

248.94 262.38 A: it'll burn it'll boil over it'll you know s- something so you you've gotta be pretty handy and you really can't be involved in anything else you know so you're you're cooking and you're cleaning and you're chopping and you're you know doing all this stuff 

250.99 253.27 B: (( all of that yeah so )) 

256.46 259.29 B: no it's yeah exactly 

260.66 261.72 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

261.78 268.38 B: and you're pretty much trapped in the kitchen for all those hours you can't like can't like go off somewhere 

265.46 268.11 A: right right and it's very difficult 

268.20 274.62 A: very difficult when you have two small ones because they command so much attention [noise] you know so 

271.13 272.21 B: how [noise] 

272.65 275.82 B: oh yeah absolutely [noise] how old are you kids 

275.16 278.83 A: um [noise] um i have a three year old and a five year old 

278.18 284.25 B: oh my god yeah that's like constant attention you can't leave them [laughter] alone [laughter] 

281.03 282.65 A: yeah [noise] so y- 

283.07 289.28 A: yeah so definitely you know a restaurant [noise] no one has to ask me twice you know 

288.04 291.85 B: yeah it's much easier [laughter] 

289.24 298.65 A: i mean [laughter] so it's not too often that ah i i s- i can't remember ever saying no let's stay home i wanna cook 

298.04 300.86 B: [laughter] no i 

299.20 301.64 A: (( [laughter] i don't ah [sigh] )) 

300.94 309.52 B: [laughter] i think cooking is like for people who don't who have lots of time and don't really have you know much else going on 

306.81 310.30 A: yeah [sigh] see my husband's m- see my husb- m- 

310.39 311.99 A: see i spoilt him 

311.69 312.96 B: [laughter] 

312.61 320.69 A: okay because when we first got married i mean i had an older daughter i have an older daughter but she's you know [noise] she's gonna be seventeen 

320.60 324.56 B: [mn] mm so she's on her own kind of doing her own thing 

322.00 325.41 A: yeah [noise] so i mean i you know i don't cook for her and 

325.56 326.57 B: yeah 

325.68 336.37 A: you know when [sigh] when my husband and first got married she was already nine or ten so it's not like i had to spend every minute with her [sigh] so i could literally spend all day cooking a meal 

332.50 333.66 B: yeah see 

336.00 337.42 B: (( that's fine [noise] sure )) 

336.21 348.78 A: so he came home every night and there was a you know nice meal on the table you know and then we have two little ones come along and he doesn't understand why i can't get that dinner on the table anymore 

340.48 341.86 B: yeah 

345.97 354.74 B: that changes everything [laughter] yeah you tell him get you a nanny and then you'll cook [laughter] 

349.82 351.48 A: you know [laughter] 

353.30 356.47 A: well it's funny because he just said to me what are we having for dinner 

356.36 357.44 B: mhm 

356.47 366.30 A: i said we're having h- hamburgers and hot dogs on the grill [noise] [noise] okay [laughter] 'cause i thought ahead [noise] and took the hamburgers out of the freezer that's why we're having that 

359.70 361.23 B: mhm 

365.86 367.15 B: mhm 

366.21 375.41 A: i mean 'cause this way ah there's no planning you know i mean i'll open up [noise] actually i i you know have some like [noise] frozen vegetables 

369.36 370.12 B: mhm 

375.20 388.33 A: you know and what i do is i get f- frozen vegetables and i either cut them up myself or i'll get them you know already mixed or whatever [sigh] and i'll put them in tinfoil pans with tinfoil covers 

387.52 389.66 B: oh and then they can go on the grill 

388.80 390.57 A: i can throw them right on the grill 

390.18 391.92 B: yeah that's perfect 

390.58 403.27 A: [mn] and then there's no cleanup there's no you know i you know i'll throw some spices on them and throw some butter in it and just toss 'em right on the grill even though they're frozen [sigh] you know because they only take a couple of minutes 

393.54 394.61 B: yeah 

400.78 402.58 B: [noise] yeah no that's great 

402.73 404.78 B: yeah they're quick 

404.11 411.66 A: and that's it you know so then i can get a decent meal on the table you know but summer is definitely 

407.89 409.31 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

411.84 414.77 A: the better time [noise] to get a meal on the table 

414.03 417.10 B: well yeah 'cause you can use your outside [laughter] 

415.93 429.34 A: c- well yeah 'cause you can use your grill you don't have to cleanup [sigh] afterwards i mean we still ha- we still use dishes i mean we don't use paper plates or anything [sigh] but but at least you don't have pots and pans and all of that [sigh] and at least 

419.74 420.82 B: mhm 

424.27 425.48 B: yeah 

427.95 434.29 B: well that's what takes the most time i mean the plates and the silverware [noise] doesn't take that much time to clean up 

429.96 430.94 A: right 

431.75 432.67 A: yes 

432.61 447.00 A: and if the kids are outside they don't command as much attention from you if they're outside yeah 'cause they're they're in their sandbox it's not like they need you to help them with the video game or turn the computer on or [sigh] change the video in in on the t._v. 

436.27 439.56 B: well it's easier to keep an eye on them too [noise] 

445.40 450.55 B: yeah and it's not you've got to constantly come in from another room to watch [noise] them 

448.23 462.18 A: [noise] yes i mean if they're out- yes if they're outside riding their bike in the driveway you don't [noise] need to be on them every second and they're not coming to see you every five seconds you know i mean because we have an enclosed yard so they can ride their bikes they can play on the swing 

454.45 455.80 B: mhm 

456.83 458.11 B: mhm 

461.09 462.79 B: oh that's nice 

462.10 470.38 A: you know they can play in in the sand you know and they do ah you know they've got a trampoline we you know in the summer we've got a pool and of course then i'll have to watch them but [sigh] 

470.39 477.99 A: i mean normally i don't have to be on them every five seconds so i can get a meal on the table [sigh] and thank god with the grill 

475.81 476.73 B: mhm 

477.83 488.07 A: you can get a decent meal on the table with a a meat and a couple of side dishes [sigh] you know but um in the winter when everybody is stuck in the house there's just too [noise] because [noise] just to go [noise] 

482.77 483.98 B: mhm 

487.17 495.16 B: (( yeah then that's [laughter] definitely more comp- well everything just takes longer in the winter [noise] )) 

489.38 490.82 A: (( to the store's like a huge production )) 

494.61 497.60 A: oh please yes it's just well when you have 

495.58 502.61 B: you can't just put everybody in the car and run out you have to bun- bundle up and then driving is a big deal 

501.85 511.64 A: oh yeah yeah my husband doesn't realise that to go grocery shopping with the two little ones takes me you know an hour and a half if i'm going to go alone i'll be back in twenty minutes [noise] 

502.80 503.71 B: (( and [noise] [noise] )) 

506.04 507.39 B: (( oh god )) 

508.17 509.64 B: oh at least 

511.20 512.63 B: sure 

512.24 518.12 A: you know i mean [laughter] big deal and he doesn't he you know he just he just doesn't grasp it 

513.12 513.72 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

517.49 523.48 B: [noise] no no well because he doesn't do it [noise] you just let him do it for a week he'll he'll [noise] know what's going on 

518.45 521.50 A: and [laughter] [laughter] 

522.55 528.30 A: but see even even then he doesn't because when men do it it's 

523.85 524.65 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

529.19 532.32 A: men don't take care of their children they babysit [sigh] 

532.03 533.71 B: (( oh )) 

532.97 540.53 A: you know so i mean they're not doing the laundry they're not doing the house cleaning they're watching the kids that's all they're doing 

535.60 538.15 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

538.97 539.65 B: (( [sigh] )) 

540.09 543.11 B: yeah no that's not the same thing 

540.77 544.09 A: see they don't have to do everything that goes with it 

543.78 546.50 B: yeah no you gotta make 'em

551.81 554.53 B: (( but your house isn't [laughter] )) 

555.81 558.80 B: [sigh] ooh that's it 

557.22 570.75 A: you know i mean so [laughter] you know it's not like you know so they can't understand you know why it you know why is it so difficult to get a meal on the table you know well [mn] because i've got twelve things going at once okay
