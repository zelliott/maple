336.41 347.81 B: and um we had um easter at her house and she she cooked like all this hu- huge meal for everyone and she couldn't eat any of it so she made her own little thing of stuff that she could eat and she made um 

347.75 351.72 B: it's a mock potato cake which she made it with cauliflower 

351.42 352.43 A: uh-huh 

351.85 359.66 B: and it turned out to taste just like regular potato cakes that you would make yet and it's really good and she just grounded up the cauliflower 

359.45 360.57 A: wow 

359.56 371.90 B: and fried it in a pan and it was so good and i would have i mean i don't even care too much for cauliflower 'cause it to me doesn't have that it don't really have a taste to it but goodness that what she made was so good i 

362.91 364.58 A: that sounds really good 

367.10 369.14 A: (( exactly that's what i was thinking )) 

371.59 373.52 A: mm that sounds good 

372.12 374.96 B: was thinking i might have to try some more of this stuff [laughter] 

374.15 380.15 A: yeah so did she that must be hard then making a whole meal and then not being able to eat any of it 

379.40 383.09 B: oh it was really hard very hard for her i felt kind of bad for her 

382.40 383.31 A: (( oh [laughter] [sigh] )) 

383.35 387.85 B: 'cause she's a big potato eater you know and that's ah against the rules 

386.29 387.54 A: yeah they're great 

387.78 392.61 A: yeah is now the aitken's diet is that the one where you can't have carbohydrates 

392.12 395.06 B: yeah you can have all the fat you want but no carbohydrates 

394.46 395.48 A: okay 

395.73 398.98 A: yeah pretty much all i eat is carbohydrates [laughter] that 

397.91 402.13 B: that's pretty much all i eat too [noise] pasta's and things like that [noise] but 

399.65 400.96 A: would be hard 

401.76 402.86 A: (( yeah right )) 

402.44 408.69 B: i don't i couldn't do it i have another friend who's trying to do that diet now and she can't even make it past 'cause she's a big potato eating person too 

408.03 408.73 A: [laughter] 

408.80 410.32 B: she wants everything 

408.87 409.82 A: now wh- 

409.96 411.69 A: (( oh i wonder )) 

412.22 419.63 A: i mean i wonder how well they work it just seems like so much of it must depend on your you know you're own biology and [mn] 

419.49 421.02 B: yeah i think so too 

421.29 422.75 B: but i don't know 

422.80 425.72 B: it she seems to lost a lot of weight on doing that so 

425.19 426.08 A: really 

426.17 431.20 B: i think it's just changing your eating habits um being able to change your eating habits you know like 

430.37 431.38 A: right 

431.22 432.64 B: um even with ah 

432.97 436.58 B: just eating the fat stuff and then being able to go 

434.95 435.92 A: right 

436.87 441.04 B: you know just go to eating just directly fats and all that i don't really know [sigh] 

440.45 446.39 A: what is the one where you on- you're only supposed to eat or you're supposed to eat a lot of fat isn't there one like that 

445.61 447.48 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] um )) 

446.51 449.42 A: that you're supposed to a lot of fatty meat and stuff 

448.80 453.21 B: i think that is the aitken's diet well that's the majority of what you eat is fat [noise] instead 

451.26 454.63 A: oh okay i'm sorry that's right and you cut out the i'm sorry 

453.60 460.93 B: of [noise] [noise] that's okay [noise] yeah you cut out all the carbohydrates so your body's not burning your carbohydrates [noise] it's burning all the fat 

460.65 461.72 A: okay 

461.44 464.04 B: so and that's really weird [noise] 'cause 

464.18 471.42 B: i don't know how that works and how someone could come up with that just by changing their eating [noise] habits and deciding that i'm going to eat all fat [laughter] 

470.89 472.06 A: i know 

471.82 479.24 B: but i could do that diet because i love bacon i love any type of meat i love meat absolutely love meat but 

479.38 484.38 B: there are things that like [noise] bread and things like that i have to have that just are 

484.40 486.48 B: full of carbohydrates 

486.02 487.16 A: right 

487.47 493.60 B: [mn] but um like bacon i me and my little boy could eat a like a whole thing of bacon daily you know 

493.06 497.58 A: it's funny i actually about a year and a half ago became a vegetarian 

496.08 498.26 B: [noise] [noise] really 

497.67 512.02 A: 'cause but i i'm i used to love meat and it's funny 'cause the things i crave the most it's bacon and sausage and all those like really fragrant fried breakfast meats like that's oh feel to this day whenever i smell it it smells so good 

511.86 514.09 B: [noise] what made you decide to be a vegetarian 

514.36 527.37 A: um i guess there is there is a variety of reasons it was partly for health reasons um partly i initially i started just buying i was concerned about a lot of the pro- the stuff that was going into the meats 

526.84 527.72 B: uh-huh 

527.42 532.22 A: so i started just trying to buy free range and organic stuff and then 

532.24 534.84 A: um i eventually just cut it out completely 

534.61 535.57 B: really 

535.16 542.33 A: yeah but it's strange your body r- really seems to adapt like i was thinking 

541.00 541.66 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

542.85 550.03 A: back to when we were talking about those diets and sometimes it it seems like it would be so hard but it's after a while if you give something up 

550.24 551.94 A: your body just seems to 

552.00 559.24 A: adjust to it like you don't crave it as much anymore except for bacon of course [laughter] i never got over that [laughter] 

557.34 560.44 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise] oh bacon is the best 

560.05 561.03 A: (( oh )) 

561.08 563.99 A: i heard was that your little boy in the background earlier 

563.71 564.84 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

565.57 570.31 B: yeah he was coming in with a little girl gave him a dollar i was like hold on [noise] wait a minute [sigh] 

569.91 572.02 A: okay what he got a dollar 

571.80 574.09 B: some little girl gave him a dollar down the road 

574.33 580.12 A: wow lucky guy [laughter] so is he a picky eater 

575.00 578.13 B: he's a cutie pie [laughter] 

579.66 591.38 B: oh my goodness he is the pickiest eater in this world i i've never [noise] met anyone as picky as him i mean he doesn't eat hardly anything [noise] he eats chicken nuggets 

583.50 584.63 A: really 

586.11 587.07 A: oh 

587.19 589.40 A: that's really hard for you right 

591.37 599.89 B: um [noise] fish sticks macaroni and cheese ramans and things like that [noise] hot dogs hamburgers and all the [noise] you know the pizza and things like that
