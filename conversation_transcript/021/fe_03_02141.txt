234.99 238.30 A: oh i'm there's chemicals for everything these days 

235.32 237.43 B: i'm i'm always wondering exactly 

237.94 245.64 B: sure it it it's ah [sigh] yeah it's it's it's kind of a wonder how they're able to do that really [lipsmack] but 

244.22 252.66 A: yeah i act- years and years ago i used to work in a in a restaurant and ah i don't know what it was but all our milkshakes used to come out of like the 

252.65 260.48 A: enormous milk containers and you put it in the machine and i guess it would cool it enough so it would thicken up more or something i'm not quite sure 

254.48 255.84 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

260.13 261.96 B: oh right yeah [noise] 

260.84 265.78 A: but ah i i remember thinking it was at least majority of milk so 

265.90 273.10 A: hopefully they're not too much bad well enough good stuff in there for you but not bad stuff what 

269.42 271.48 B: [sigh] i think in the mcdonald's case [noise] 

272.49 275.78 B: yeah i think in the mcdonalds case it's probably plastic 

275.21 277.87 A: (( [laughter] oh yeah )) 

276.88 284.69 B: they actually put ah you ever noticed that they never quite melt [mn] i think they put ah they they put gelatin in them 

283.95 289.16 A: t- to get sort of ah the the the ah anti equivalent of anti freeze in there 

288.69 292.14 B: [mn] [mn] yeah it's it's basically always freeze [sigh] so 

291.42 292.81 A: (( exactly [noise] )) 

292.22 301.21 B: right yeah that stuff is um [sigh] it's kinda scary you know i mean it it should have the same physical properties as matter but in fact it doesn't 

300.66 301.66 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] there )) 

301.42 311.49 B: [mn] [sigh] it just kinda does its own thing it's kind of an amorphous blob um never quite liquid never quite never quite solid but somewhere in between 

311.92 312.48 B: (( [mn] )) 

311.94 312.79 A: (( you go )) 

313.08 315.67 B: it seems to be temperature independent too [laughter] 

313.18 314.23 A: yeah 

314.58 317.29 A: [laughter] there's ah 

318.13 323.16 A: the ah what was i gonna say i was gonna say something about other milkshakes whatever now do you like ice cream though 

322.95 326.57 B: oh yeah yeah [sigh] it's hard to get good ice cream though 

326.68 327.51 B: you know 

327.09 331.38 A: yeah i actually have near me too there's a ben and jerry's right across the street 

330.43 339.31 B: [sigh] yeah that's that is good there there [lipsmack] you know we used to make ice cream when we were kids that the homemade stuff is just that's the best right [sigh] can't beat that [mn] 

334.68 335.79 A: mhm 

339.08 344.06 A: exactly as long as you still have arm left after like cranking up that crank for an hour and a half or whatever it was is 

343.51 345.25 B: yeah well [laughter] 

344.21 347.07 A: that how you did it with ah spinning the thing and the ice an all that 

345.51 351.97 B: i think that's why it tasted so good [laughter] yeah [laughter] right the ice and the salt that's right [laughter] [noise] [sigh] 

347.46 349.51 A: (( [laughter] it sort that's )) 

351.17 355.34 A: 'cause the the the ah taste is in the effort [mn] yeah 

354.57 363.70 B: taste is definitely in the effort because otherwise you just don't have a [sigh] you know y- y- y- otherwise you'd just buy it at the store and get kinda mediocre ice cream for free right 

362.94 365.96 A: take it for granted although i will say my favorite is 

363.76 364.84 B: right 

366.92 368.48 A: breyer's 

368.66 370.91 A: ah just plain vanilla bean

373.10 377.35 B: yeah that's that that's pretty good stuff that's pretty good stuff [sigh] 

376.46 377.76 A: the basics 

377.72 379.33 B: [noise] so what about desserts 

379.40 385.46 A: um i'm actually not a huge dessert fan like even like just talking about ice cream right now like i i eat ice cream 

379.67 381.07 B: other than ice cream [noise] 

385.81 395.32 A: once every six months you know what i mean like i i'm not a dessert person i like the appetizer i like the entrees and i'm usually too full after that 

389.22 390.49 B: mhm 

394.76 396.04 B: (( [laughter] )) 

395.53 409.74 A: you know it's j- the ah i'm like the ah the master of going to a place like ah olive garden or something like that and loading up so much on the bread and the ah and the salad that [sigh] i just take my entree to go an eat it for lunch the next day [noise] [noise] 

408.85 410.58 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

410.85 419.37 B: well they tend to do that don't they at those ah those places where they have an all you can eat type type environment basically [laughter] 

418.07 418.92 A: (( mm )) 

419.15 431.44 A: well and that's the nice part about that place it's because like other all you can eat places like you eat as much as you can in that sitting and then it's over [sigh] with the whole like entree thing like i i literally take three or four bites and i'm then like [sigh] 

431.32 435.58 A: you know i i'm just not going to gorge myself i can't really eat any more 

434.99 443.26 B: [noise] [laughter] well i usually can't quite make it past the salad phase [laughter] so you know [sigh] you know especially those kinds of places so 

435.64 436.79 A: so 

440.31 441.85 A: see if i yeah 

442.71 451.58 A: yeah if i were intelligent i would just order the bread stick and salad and the soup and salad and [sigh] be full and leave and spend a whole lot less money but for some reason i still always go for the entree so 

451.20 458.46 B: mhm [mn] [sigh] yep that that's the inclination i think that's where they get you you know they know that they can get you that way [sigh] 

456.33 457.43 A: mhm 

458.58 459.54 B: so 

458.78 461.40 A: oh really how much does it cost to make the pasta 

460.69 462.15 B: right [laughter]
