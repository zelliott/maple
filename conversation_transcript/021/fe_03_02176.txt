59.58 60.64 B: (( ooh )) 

65.46 72.72 A: twelve days so [laughter] [sigh] it's getting a little old er yeah and and plus we're forced to eat out a lot because [lipsmack] 

66.23 68.53 B: oh yeah that's that's a bit much 

73.00 77.75 A: my daughter's in competitive [noise] soccer and we're always just we're just going everywhere so 

75.06 75.99 B: oh 

76.65 77.70 B: oh 

77.59 88.35 A: sometimes my biggest treat is just to sit down in h- at home to a real meal and eat because [sigh] i'd say we don't get to do it any more more than about 

81.69 82.80 B: (( at home )) 

86.49 87.42 B: yeah 

88.37 92.92 A: about maybe maybe once a week or twice a week at the most so

94.70 95.96 A: [laughter] 

98.94 108.17 B: and i always take something for lunch 'cause with a half an hour you know by the time you get somewhere [sigh] you know then you don't have time to eat [sigh] then by the time i get home [sigh] 

108.15 122.45 B: i mean and you have to [sigh] you know i do whatever i'm going to do around the house and get ready for the next day and try to catch up on work i didn't get done [sigh] uh well okay like right now i'm fixing my dinner which consists of [sigh] a toasted swiss cheese and tomato sandwich [sigh] 

122.05 122.97 A: (( oh )) 

122.38 129.47 B: you know so i guess in a way i'm [sigh] fortunate i don't have [sigh] anyone here that i have to please but myself 

128.81 131.40 A: there you go yeah yeah [laughter] 

129.62 135.40 B: yeah but in a way [sigh] you know i get tired of [sigh] so i guess eating out for me is more of a 

135.24 145.56 B: [sigh] a treat than it probably is for you but my perfect meal my well i still [noise] although i am trying to get away from it [noise] i'm still like a big red meat [noise] eater 

137.54 139.05 A: yeah 

145.13 146.07 A: (( mm )) 

146.04 158.81 B: prime rib baked potato [sigh] [noise] and [noise] salad and [noise] home made bread i think [noise] would probably [noise] be my [noise] idea of a [noise] perfect [noise] meal [noise] i'm not much for sweets and i'm not much for desserts i'm more of a curb 

158.45 163.18 A: yeah you know i don't really have a perfect meal i mean there's so much [noise] 

159.01 160.09 B: person 

163.20 173.97 A: i like [noise] that it doesn't really matter to me i mean sometimes my perfect meal is something that n- well usually my perfect meal's something that nobody else in my house would eat 

164.31 165.14 B: uh-huh 

173.49 174.91 B: [laughter] 

173.93 178.38 A: like you know like like uh calves liver and onions you know 

177.12 179.57 B: (( oh ooh i love liver and onions )) 

178.54 186.02 A: and stuff like that that no one else will eat it's just devine to be able to find a place that will have that stuff 

180.26 182.48 B: [laughter] 

183.85 184.69 B: (( [laughter] )) 

185.16 197.93 B: well you know we do have now there are quite a few columbus is a very big [sigh] um restaurant town [sigh] there are lots and lots of chains come in here i guess it's because it's the perfect test market 

197.58 199.48 A: i've heard that yeah 

197.80 203.80 B: but there are a lot of places here where you can get liver and onions i mean and 

201.34 207.32 A: yeah i'll have to come up and visit c. uh ohio or indiana ohio okay 

205.54 218.15 B: ohio yeah they um yeah but this is this is one thing and well though we do have a variety and i'll tell you that thai food and the middle eastern food is starting to catch catch on here 

214.36 215.66 A: oh yeah 

217.53 220.64 A: yeah that's all the rage here every other place 

218.18 218.76 B: (( y- )) 

218.84 223.82 B: yeah oh you know isn't that funny i mean for the longest time here in columbus [sigh] 

223.94 236.00 B: if if exotic was like chinese you know and yet i would notice that people [sigh] would still stay very close to things they were familiar with like fried rice [sigh] and you know nothing 

235.90 247.94 B: nothing indefinable nothing whatever but we do have a couple of sushi places here now [sigh] and i don't know i mean it's all right if once you get past [noise] the thought of what you're actually eating 

247.88 260.17 B: i [laughter] i think that the the big draw with the sushi restaurants is more the presentation [sigh] you know it's all [noise] it's very decorative and the colors are so nice and they're arranged so nicely 

248.21 250.26 A: [laughter] 

256.96 257.90 A: (( [laughter] oh yeah )) 

259.38 260.55 A: yeah 

260.18 270.01 B: you know you really [sigh] forget that you're paying nine ninety five for for two bites of raw fish and an octopus tentacle or stuff [laughter] like that you know [laughter] 

265.49 280.21 A: oh yeah [laughter] well yeah and that's that's something i usually don't eat except on a an expense account [laughter] we do have a favorite sushi restaurant here that [noise] we go to but not very often 'cause it's so expensive 

273.15 274.66 B: no mhm 

277.83 278.85 B: no 

278.70 288.36 B: no that is the kind of thing you know and of course [sigh] you know i don't know about your daughter but when my son is here [sigh] because he's in college and i think he probably lives mostly on [sigh] 

288.31 301.96 B: cereal and fri- you know leftover pizza [sigh] you know he's always [sigh] wanting somebody to cook this or cook that but then of course there's always the infamous white castle [sigh] i don't know if you guys have anything 

299.70 300.74 A: (( [laughter] )) 

301.15 308.40 A: no we really don't have it but we just got steak n shake down here actually yeah so that's pretty exciting 

302.21 304.01 B: an equivalent to 

305.02 309.73 B: oh really oh my [laughter] huh 

308.41 309.97 A: (( it's pretty exciting )) 

310.05 320.43 A: [sigh] but yeah um and see my daughter's miss pasta girl pasta and pizza so that's what she always wants and my husband hates it so you know it's like oh [sigh]

318.59 320.01 B: [laughter] 

320.75 335.33 A: i just finally told them i said there's no you know you either sit down and eat what i'm fixing or you don't eat you know but you know what i don't really you know what when somebody says what would your last meal be i just don't know what i'd say 'cause i like so many different things

332.13 333.05 B: mhm 

333.71 334.69 B: yeah 

334.46 348.93 B: you know and uh we we used to have the contest too about if you could only eat like one type of food [sigh] for the rest of your life what would it be [sigh] and for me it would have to be potatoes you know because there's so many different things you can do with a potato 

341.35 342.66 A: oh yeah 

345.64 346.86 A: really 

347.65 355.96 A: well that's true but n- yeah that's true well i don't know because i uh i had a cousin that went to iceland for a year and all they eat is

385.10 396.03 B: i will fix the same kind of food and my grandmother and grandfather were farm people [sigh] so the meat always had gravy the vegetables always had cream sauce there was always bread on the table 

395.55 397.16 A: mhm 

395.96 401.50 B: you know so we grew up with that also and then finally you know when my mom was like
