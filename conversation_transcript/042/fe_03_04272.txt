3.35 6.46 B: uh this is larry i live in maine how about you 

6.12 8.83 A: [mn] hi larry i'm here in atlanta georgia 

9.70 12.02 A: (( we have an unusual uh topic today )) 

11.53 13.27 B: yes i see we do 

12.86 21.07 A: [laughter] [sigh] um [lipsmack] any thoughts on what you might change if you had the ability to uh 

21.18 23.44 A: go back in your own life and change something 

22.84 31.14 B: yeah i think i might change technology and go back about fifty years or well even more [laughter] maybe a hundred years [laughter] 

29.93 32.71 A: no no i think it said within your own life 

32.25 33.39 B: [sigh] i'm sorry 

33.10 37.26 A: i think the uh instructions said uh something within your own life 

37.64 41.13 A: your own your own lifetime 

40.45 44.06 B: well i didn't understand it that way but you're probably correct 

44.99 45.87 B: uh 

45.03 46.43 A: (( um )) 

46.08 47.22 B: how 'bout you 

46.90 59.49 A: well me uh [sigh] let me see i had a mid mid way through my uh life i went back to school and got my masters uh degree um [lipsmack] 

59.60 65.12 A: (( uh and it was like one of the best things i ever did for myself but uh i would like to have uh )) 

65.21 76.60 A: maybe done that a lot earlier um [lipsmack] than now uh because it's been such a positive um life changing kind of thing [lipsmack] 

75.59 87.22 B: well i guess probably if i had that to do over again i would do it right out of college i uh i never did finish mine [laughter] [laughter] [sigh] and a disappoint probably i won't 

82.81 84.35 A: [laughter] 

86.87 88.19 A: (( [sigh] all right )) 

87.57 88.70 B: uh 

89.35 92.25 B: but i really do it's probably a smart thing to do 

92.42 96.20 A: what uh so you started your masters you say but never finished 

95.63 101.13 B: uh well i didn't officially enroll but i started [laughter] taking graduate level courses 

100.63 102.06 A: yeah 

101.21 106.12 B: [sigh] and uh then i moved and i got farther away from the university 

105.69 107.52 A: (( yes yes [lipsmack] )) 

106.94 113.26 B: so it was a longer commute so i didn't bother to take a course and then i had a couple of children 

113.08 114.56 A: (( oh well of course )) 

113.92 119.00 B: so that kind of interfered and yeah by the time they grew up well i was 

115.39 117.15 A: (( [laughter] )) 

119.02 125.98 B: in my forties and i said well is there any point in going back now so [laughter] [sigh] [sigh] 

124.41 126.43 A: probably probably not 

126.03 135.85 B: [sigh] well [sigh] it was easier to rationalize it that way for me [sigh] so i never did complete it i've i don't know nine hours probably or something like that 

128.92 130.04 A: yeah 

135.68 138.16 A: oh really you're that close gosh oh 

137.61 140.20 B: no no i i took about nine hours [mn] 

139.74 141.84 A: (( you took about nine hours i see okay )) 

142.36 143.63 A: [lipsmack] but uh 

144.23 156.59 A: (( i'm i'm thinking if there's any other thing that i might change if i could um [lipsmack] um you know other than you know starting school earlier um )) 

157.37 164.22 A: probably um you know maybe getting into computers [laughter] a little bit [laughter] y- younger in my life 

164.29 167.79 A: (( [sigh] um [lipsmack] i was sort of late- uh )) 

167.95 174.11 A: getting on getting into computers which only made it more difficult i think 

173.48 177.11 B: well i had a tendency to fight that and 

176.19 178.07 A: (( [laughter] )) 

177.41 187.22 B: and that's why i say [laughter] if i could roll back the hands of time i'd roll back technology because [sigh] i'm a great [sigh] personally i like to tinkle with things 

187.13 189.28 A: yeah yeah 

187.67 191.45 B: but uh you know i'm kind of mechanically inclined but [sigh] 

190.26 191.43 A: uh-huh 

191.67 197.05 B: uh now i'm finding that with all the computer technology that everything has why 

193.88 194.65 A: [noise] 

195.79 197.84 A: (( yes yes [noise] )) 

197.11 200.28 B: the need to do that is sort of passing me by 

200.56 206.99 B: [sigh] i know and there are some other things i guess i would change too i'd probably start my family a l- a little bit earlier 

206.46 208.04 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

207.37 208.45 B: uh 

209.88 211.02 B: [noise] i uh 

211.18 219.83 B: i look back on that and i thought it was wise to wait and start you know [laughter] after i had a good secure job and had been working for a few years 

220.25 224.10 B: so i got a late start compared to most of the people i went to high school with 

223.64 225.08 A: (( [noise] )) 

224.34 226.76 B: but uh now [lipsmack] 

225.13 225.73 A: (( [noise] )) 

227.22 229.30 B: i'm finding that uh 

230.15 240.84 B: you know uh neither of my children are married [laughter] [sigh] and if i become a grandpa well i'm probably going to be too old to enjoy my grandchildren so [laughter] 

232.27 234.42 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [laughter] )) 

238.24 239.60 A: (( [laughter] the )) 

240.05 246.03 A: (( kids today i think are waiting longer and longer to get married and then to have kids after that i think )) 

245.49 248.34 B: i think so i think this generation is 

247.17 250.33 A: (( um [lipsmack] uh i think there is uh )) 

251.31 261.13 A: [sigh] mm [lipsmack] th- they they don't want to commit to things uh and there's a lot of uncertainty about the future i think i think that's a part of it as well 

260.20 268.19 B: i think that's part of it too and uh and i think a big part of that probably comes from the economic climate 

267.91 269.16 A: yeah 

268.51 273.93 B: and uh you know the fast pace of the world that we're living in [sigh] uh 

274.83 280.74 B: i don't know thirty years ago i it seemed liked it was easier to step out of college and get a 

281.13 283.77 B: a job that paid a decent wage a 

283.77 284.90 A: (( well it )) 

283.85 285.20 B: decent salary 

284.95 295.76 A: yeah it used to be you know when m- my father's lifetime you know one person could work and support a family and uh 

292.70 293.50 B: right 

295.37 296.74 B: now it takes two 

296.43 301.44 A: (( now it takes two and there's uh there's a trade off with that so um )) 

302.43 303.63 A: (( [lipsmack] uh )) 

304.85 314.50 A: i don't know if people are uh you know they're willing to do what it takes you know like the feller has to chip in around the house and uh you can't just leave it to your partner 

315.55 319.95 B: [noise] [sigh] [cough] you know i think times have changed a great deal there's no question about that 

318.61 321.18 A: (( um definitely )) 

320.64 326.94 B: [cough] i don't know i i think maybe we're deviating from the topic here again [laughter] 

324.07 333.51 A: okay [laughter] well originally i thought the topic was just to time travel in general and um and i was thinking my gosh i might even like to go in the future 

333.52 337.30 A: to see how things turn out rather than just in the past you know 

337.52 339.63 B: well that's an interesting concept 

339.61 340.66 A: (( so but )) 

339.76 343.94 B: maybe if we could travel a little faster than the speed of light we could look ahead 

342.73 344.79 A: (( um exactly )) 

343.97 349.26 B: or look back [laughter] [sigh] depending on which way we were going right 

344.97 346.69 A: [laughter] 

348.04 350.74 A: [laughter] 

349.69 352.20 B: [laughter] that would be an interesting thought wouldn't it 

352.03 357.13 A: (( uh i mean there's some there's some things happening now that i'd like to sort of see how they all pan out you know )) 

357.02 358.02 B: yes 

357.50 358.89 A: (( um i )) 

358.31 360.58 B: i i hear you on that one so would i 

360.52 372.70 A: mean it uh i just feel like it's almost like a class of uh cultures now western cultures versus middle eastern or something and i'm just you know 

373.42 387.99 A: um [lipsmack] i'm just hoping it's not going to go that way but [lipsmack] i'm just curious to see how m- that all might turn out [lipsmack] but uh i don't think there's any other things i would change i've been married twice so 

388.63 397.30 A: a part of me i guess maybe thinks well maybe if i had could have gone back in time maybe i could have made the first one work or 

397.35 403.38 A: maybe not have pursued that path um that things might have been different 

404.00 405.24 A: (( but )) 

404.62 413.17 B: well i've had that same thought too uh it sounds like you and i think about a lot some of the same things here i've been married twice [sigh] and 

405.60 407.20 A: (( um mhm )) 

408.49 410.99 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

412.15 415.31 A: (( and i'm i'm guessing you're probably about uh fifty five [mn] )) 

415.30 419.44 B: you're pretty close [laughter] i'll be fifty four the end of this year 

419.02 427.87 A: yeah i'm i'm forty i'll be forty three in a couple of weeks heck no forty four i forget you start forgetting what age you are after a certain age 

427.93 429.82 A: (( [lipsmack] but um )) 

429.83 430.39 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

431.46 444.81 A: i haven't really lived life uh with something with many regrets you know that i'd want to go back and try to change things you know i've always just sort of lived with the decisions i've made 

444.40 447.96 B: yeah well i have [laughter] but [cough] 

445.68 446.24 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

446.27 447.93 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

448.12 452.28 B: all of those are things probably if i were to live life over 

451.87 452.90 A: uh-huh 

453.05 455.57 B: that i would consider doing a little differently 

455.16 456.90 A: yeah 

456.26 461.64 B: probably waiting a little bit later to get married and having children a little bit earlier 

458.70 460.00 A: right 

462.11 467.01 B: and uh probably getting masters degree and maybe in a different field 

468.60 469.63 B: (( uh [sigh] [cough] )) 

468.69 471.41 A: what did what did you study when you were in school 

470.82 475.36 B: oh i taught school for quite a few years uh so i majored in education 

475.08 476.05 A: of course 

475.76 478.39 B: and it would've been 

479.09 482.50 B: i think probably very smart to just keep it ongoing 

482.10 483.35 A: mhm 

482.70 488.36 B: which i did i did start doing that for a summer but [laughter] i got sidetracked so 

484.54 485.59 A: yeah 

487.59 491.16 A: well in the education field um 

491.55 498.09 A: [lipsmack] they really value education so the more you have under your belt the farther you can really go 

497.97 499.85 B: i think that's true yeah 

498.95 501.51 A: um but i think ultimately though 

501.72 516.15 A: the best and the brightest and that it's becoming managers of people rather than teachers you know they tend to elevate you into administration at a certain point and then you sort of get away from the kind of things that maybe brought you in 

511.97 513.24 B: (( ah )) 

516.13 524.41 B: in the in maine here where where we live we have uh a licensor for master teacher 

516.39 518.02 A: (( to the field in the first place )) 

524.22 525.23 A: uh-huh 

524.91 526.30 B: and 

526.64 530.78 B: not all school systems in maine participate in that but 

530.93 533.19 B: the system i retired from did 

532.86 533.92 A: uh-huh 

533.69 537.77 B: and it did exactly as as you're suggesting uh 

538.32 543.05 B: it it took those people out of the classroom for a good part of the time 

540.80 541.97 A: mhm 

542.58 543.83 A: yeah 

543.08 545.55 B: and they became mentors 

545.78 549.33 B: rather than teachers and 

545.95 546.88 A: oh 

547.80 549.34 A: oh 

549.47 550.99 B: i mean [sigh] i- 

552.10 556.76 B: it's good and bad at the same time okay the kids the kids lost the benefit of it [lipsmack] 

552.15 552.73 A: (( uh-huh )) 

553.51 555.68 A: yeah i can see some benefit of that 

556.19 557.48 A: mhm 

556.87 568.11 B: at the same time they're in positions where they could influence and help to mould teachers to become better teachers but [sigh] uh i know we had [sigh] the superintendent that hired me in that system 

562.89 564.51 A: well yeah 

568.70 583.51 B: uh felt that th- those people very he very strongly felt that those people should be in the class room [sigh] and i have a tendency to agree with that but i'm a little bit conservative i guess in my thinking so maybe i'm a little out of touch with 

574.28 576.28 A: right 

580.61 581.85 A: mhm 

583.61 584.95 B: current trends 

584.86 585.82 A: (( well )) 

585.01 586.74 B: (( [laughter] that way [laughter] )) 

587.73 596.93 A: well especially in teaching though they'll have those trends you know that do you know and others pushed you know have since been you know it's 

596.99 599.66 A: (( not considered you know the best thinking ))
