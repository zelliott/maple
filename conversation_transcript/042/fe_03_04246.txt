15.04 23.58 A: oh [sigh] that's a tough one you know [sigh] if i could really change something i'd done i would change that i would not have been in an accident so i would not be disabled 

23.42 32.60 A: [sigh] but since i can't change that [laughter] i think you know if we all could change something we had done [sigh] it might be [sigh] 

33.17 36.20 A: i don't know for me i think it might be that 

36.25 37.81 A: i would have [sigh] 

38.07 40.51 A: had children i think 

41.20 42.75 A: um what about you 

43.09 48.43 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] uh if i could have done things differently i would have waited on having children um 

47.65 51.41 A: [laughter] well we're just the opposite aren't we [laughter] ah 

52.08 53.31 B: i um 

54.13 55.68 B: would have um 

56.44 57.62 B: probably 

58.20 59.52 B: not have had 'em 

59.76 66.52 B: single i had my first child at twenty four i was in college i was doing good you know no husband no relationship and um 

67.41 68.36 B: um 

68.60 69.20 B: (( [cough] [lipsmack] )) 

70.61 71.57 B: i just 

74.76 75.84 B: i um 

76.38 78.52 A: you just had your children young huh 

77.77 87.97 B: yeah and and now i'm a single mum of three [noise] so if i had my choice i love my kids and i know that even [sigh] my choice god still had his plan 

81.05 82.13 A: (( oh )) 

88.20 93.99 B: [sigh] and children you know he gave life that's why i know he gave it in his timing but i would have um 

95.47 97.70 A: done a few more things first maybe 

95.61 96.33 B: (( [sigh] )) 

96.48 99.04 B: i yeah i would have done a few more things but 

98.36 109.35 A: [laughter] you know it's funny we're just the opposite because i mean i [sigh] haven't had children yet and i you know now i'm thinking gee now i'm thirty four i wish i had had 'em when i was younger 

109.08 111.12 B: [laughter] how old are you now 

109.77 112.28 A: [laughter] [sigh] thirty four 

111.87 113.76 B: oh okay okay 

112.72 115.74 A: [sigh] so you know i could s- i can still have them 

116.16 121.61 A: i guess i've just always been so wrapped up in my job and you know how that goes 

116.21 117.54 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

122.00 129.69 A: [sigh] and everything i just haven't done it and so but you know i think you know i think of your situation i think but it must be hard you know 

128.37 131.06 B: (( yeah it's it's hard )) 

129.85 132.94 A: to raise three children by yourself and 

133.61 139.29 A: [sigh] especially you know [sigh] um having them i mean twenty four's not that young i guess but 

139.51 142.57 A: i guess if you're doing something else at the time it is 

142.92 144.00 A: (( i don't know )) 

142.93 143.93 B: oh 

145.41 146.58 A: (( [sigh] i i [mn] )) 

147.03 150.15 A: you know it it isn't it funny though that most people 

150.89 156.08 A: say so- that they would have had or have not children that they would or wouldn't have gotten married 

155.75 158.33 B: [mn] [sigh] i i would love to be married i'm 

158.82 159.94 B: i'm not 

160.03 163.97 B: against marriage and i'm not against having children 

164.03 175.93 B: i just you know wish things could have been different or i you know i technically probably could have been [sigh] you know waited on my children have my children and my husband die or leave me and i'm a single parent so it could have happened any which way 

175.04 175.96 A: right 

175.70 180.64 B: it could have been god's destiny for me to be a single parent at this particular time i'm not sure 

180.56 187.74 A: [sigh] mm must be [laughter] [sigh] oh you must be doing okay you're walking and talking [laughter] 

181.89 183.21 B: (( [laughter] )) 

183.41 184.95 B: but i mean 

185.64 186.74 B: yeah i 

186.93 195.02 B: i can't complain because i own my own business at home so [sigh] um and it's it gets a little hard at times but for the most part 

195.23 196.13 B: um 

196.63 206.68 B: i thank god for everything that he's provided for me and my kids and even sitting at home i get tired sometimes and i'm like okay god [sigh] he's in control i'm not in control you know 

206.52 207.63 A: right 

207.20 218.18 B: and i just have to be patient and know that he's you know he's going to do what needs to be done and in his time and in his time only like now i desire a husband because [sigh] being a single parent isn't easy [sigh] [sigh] 

207.90 208.77 A: right 

217.88 220.08 A: right well and you know i 

218.34 221.32 B: and paying all the bills by yourself isn't [laughter] easy 

221.08 232.85 A: right [sigh] and i think you know to say well if you could change something what would you change that's difficult because [sigh] you always tick the obvious things and in reality if you could go back and change things it might be little things 

232.61 236.31 B: [noise] [sigh] oh for me it would have been to finish college um 

236.42 238.58 B: [sigh] for me i don't know 

239.00 249.68 B: [sigh] just my mind frame i have a close relationship with god if i could have changed that and take these last five years and five years ago had a closer relationship with god [sigh] that would have been 

239.98 240.70 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

242.22 242.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

249.70 255.73 B: something that i would have loved to have changed because [sigh] i truly believe my life would have took a different road 

252.68 253.50 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

255.79 262.66 B: [sigh] and i i would have been closer with him therefore i wouldn't have gotten y- you know the little stuff that i did get into 

256.04 257.75 A: yeah maybe [laughter] 

259.64 260.43 A: (( [noise] [sigh] )) 

263.07 267.47 A: right yeah maybe that's true i guess you'll never know huh [laughter] 

263.33 265.05 B: (( [sigh] you know but once again )) 

265.11 275.71 B: [laughter] [noise] no i won't that's why i don't worry about what i could or should or would have did i just worry about where i'm at now and where where do i pick up from now so what i do in 

273.10 279.47 A: [noise] right i think i think we have to be more fo- [noise] future focused maybe becau- and present focused 

276.97 281.36 B: [mn] yeah than past y- [sigh] you use your past tense to 

281.34 293.88 B: [sigh] to enlighten you to show you your errors show you what you could h- do better [sigh] and and then you do better because it's like my says when you know to do better and choose not to 

282.21 282.85 A: [noise] 

287.19 290.67 A: (( right [laughter] [sigh] right [noise] )) 

293.67 294.37 A: [noise] 

294.03 306.80 B: you know that is when your destiny is doomed [sigh] because y- once you h- you ha- everyone has to have a past and they have to have something that they would or should or could have [sigh] and would have changed in order to be a better person today done differently [sigh] and maybe there are things i would have done differently yet i don't have any regrets really you know what i mean 

296.73 297.68 A: right 

306.08 315.29 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] you know what's funny though [sigh] you know when they asked that question i'm like well what would i have [noise] )) 

315.76 328.05 A: i mean just like you don't you think well i had the kids well [sigh] you know maybe that was meant to be [laughter] so [sigh] i mean you know it i think there's a difference maybe between thinking about what you might change and really having regrets about 

316.40 317.45 B: (( mhm )) 

327.82 330.86 A: the way you did things or i don't know i just [sigh] 

330.30 332.31 B: how long have you been doing surveys 

332.30 333.64 A: h- what i'm sorry 

333.23 334.99 B: how long have you been doing surveys 

335.79 337.77 A: i i can't hear you very good 

336.60 338.72 B: how long have you been doing surveys 

338.29 341.20 A: [sigh] oh this is just my second one 

340.86 342.02 B: oh okay 

341.63 344.85 A: i did one yesterday and this is the second one how about you [laughter] 

344.30 345.72 B: this is my third one 

345.40 346.79 A: (( oh so you [laughter] )) 

346.12 348.04 B: i [sigh] i guess this is it 

347.62 349.82 A: [sigh] oh this is it for you huh [laughter] 

349.01 351.10 B: i well they they say you can only do three 

350.90 360.97 A: oh right yeah [sigh] sometimes it you have to sometimes it's a little hard to hear you 'cause sometimes 'cause sometimes my dog barks [laughter] obnoxious but anyway [sigh] so things we would have done differently huh 

352.44 353.24 B: so 

355.46 356.26 B: oh 

356.60 357.44 B: (( oh )) 

360.38 362.26 B: you're thirty four years old 

361.65 362.69 A: uh-huh 

362.38 365.91 B: so you've still got time to have kids and change what you would have done differently 

365.34 367.79 A: i do yeah that's true 

366.70 368.45 B: so you're not married 

368.76 369.76 A: (( [sigh] no )) 

369.93 372.92 A: not yet [laughter] [sigh] so yeah 

370.66 371.62 B: okay 

371.81 374.18 B: so you work do you work for yourself or 

374.11 376.05 A: no i don't i [sigh] 

375.27 376.15 B: okay 

376.53 378.41 A: i work in retail [sigh] 

377.87 378.94 B: (( oh okay )) 

378.49 382.39 A: so [sigh] but i [sigh] um i don't know i 

381.46 386.15 B: would you have changed that you know from the past to now where you're at as far as your career 

386.16 386.83 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

386.71 387.86 A: (( i don't know )) 

387.90 391.46 A: i hadn't really though about that i m- i might you know [sigh] i think [sigh] [lipsmack] 

392.31 402.85 A: it's very difficult to talk about what you would have done differently because i think we're all a product of our environment and we're all a product of our circumstances 

402.76 405.67 B: yeah some of us have to go through those circum- 

403.21 407.75 A: you know and you and it's very easy to look back and say i would have done this and that differently 

406.71 408.70 B: yeah exactly 

408.05 410.77 A: but you don't really know that for sure 

410.06 415.33 B: you don't because the bottom like of it if i had to do things all over again [sigh] 

410.80 411.91 A: you know 

415.44 429.05 B: oh [mn] i guess like i say the thing that i would have changed is having a closer relationship with god therefore i know that my children may have came later [sigh] but [noise] if it was god's [noise] predestination [sigh] for them to be here at this time there's nothing 

428.89 432.13 B: [sigh] that i could have done to make it different 

431.50 436.79 A: right exactly so [sigh] you know there's no point in saying oh gee [laughter] 

432.83 435.15 B: so the bottom line [mn] 

436.62 440.14 B: so the yeah so the bottom line is is simple 

440.21 442.47 B: and you know 

443.58 450.38 B: so i probably you know would have had my children at the age that i had 'em because there may be a point in life when 

450.47 452.14 B: i can't have children 

451.94 453.52 A: yeah yeah 

452.68 456.01 B: so you know he may know that better than me 

455.93 457.07 A: that's right [sigh] 

456.18 464.20 B: so is there something that i would have done differently [sigh] and you know turned it around maybe maybe not 

464.48 465.67 B: (( so [noise] [sigh] )) 

464.60 476.75 A: huh and you know what else i was thinking too you know if you asked that question of somebody what would you have done differently i bet you people's reactions are really different if you'd ask them that when they're say fifty than if you ask them that when they're thirty or 

476.59 482.76 A: if yeah i mean you know what depending on what age a person is they might have a really different perspective on that [sigh] 

479.26 480.46 B: mhm 

482.26 483.15 B: uh-huh 

483.15 489.25 A: because i i just think y- that at different points in your life you really look at things differently 

489.50 492.93 A: i mean when you were eighteen just think of how you looked at things when you were eighteen 

493.38 494.66 B: (( oh [noise] mhm )) 

493.53 499.57 A: (( you know if somebody would have asked you then what you would have done differently [laughter] i think you probably would have said [laughter] oh [laughter] you know nothing [laughter] )) 

499.40 500.87 B: yeah that's true 

499.89 504.02 A: i mean i mean it's really different when you're you're um [mn] 

503.60 513.77 B: [noise] i had a lot of i had a lot of issues [sigh] so to me i i i i d- i c- i don't even know if i could have said i i wouldn't have wanted to have those issues [sigh] um 

506.41 507.36 A: [laughter] 

513.77 522.26 B: i just i don't i i guess i personally [sigh] there's not much i probably would have changed except be having a closer relationship with god with all honesty 

522.23 523.39 A: yeah well 

522.42 526.98 B: really 'cause i feel but with that alone i could have saved myself 

527.21 529.09 B: a lot of um 

529.73 533.80 B: a lot of heartache a lot of unnecessary disappointments 

533.66 540.78 A: uh maybe but but on the other hand [sigh] maybe you needed to have those heartaches and disappointments for a reason [laughter] 

533.98 535.00 B: you know 

540.86 542.29 B: you know so 

541.19 554.41 A: [sigh] you know you never know [laughter] [sigh] so yeah it's hard and that's a tough question and i i don't know i would hate to go and stand on a street corner and ask people that question [laughter] because i don't know you know 

554.47 559.01 A: i think some people would would have a million things they would do differently 

559.10 560.38 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

559.29 568.59 A: you know and and other people would just say well you can't do anything differently that's a stupid question [laughter] [sigh] you i mean really if i asked some of the people i work with that's what they would say 

563.37 565.23 B: [laughter] 

568.82 577.84 A: [sigh] you know that's stupid you know why would you even think about it [laughter] [sigh] so i don't know it's a it's an interesting question [sigh] and it's a um [lipsmack] 

578.76 587.95 A: a more simplistic question i guess than the other one i had was kind of complicated whereas that's kind of just so almost like a one sentence question 

583.38 584.26 B: uh-huh 

587.97 589.12 B: yeah 

588.13 592.29 A: you know [sigh] so i uh i don't know [sigh] 

593.44 597.76 A: i i you know the more you think about that the more you really wonder 

598.60 599.89 A: if if you
