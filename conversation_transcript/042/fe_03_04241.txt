382.14 390.81 B: right yeah it is it's a nice thought i mean it's just a a broad question it's like i don't know where to begin [laughter] [laughter]

402.22 403.76 A: uh i don't know i 

404.25 407.03 A: i kind of like the diversity that we have 

407.28 408.34 A: (( you know i )) 

408.66 411.15 A: i i work with some people who are 

412.93 419.44 A: not of not of the same race as mine i i have some very dear friends who are not of the same religion as mine

440.08 441.86 A: that 

442.82 449.73 A: it it's nice that they're different you know and uh i don't mean to say that in a in a negative kind of way 

450.26 451.68 A: (( you know but )) 

451.88 453.95 A: that diversity i- is 

452.80 454.69 B: yeah life would be boring 

454.77 457.48 B: life would would definitely be boring 

455.16 456.69 A: yeah it would be 

456.81 460.65 A: exactly it it'd be way too boring and 

461.21 462.79 A: it's a nice thought though 

462.27 464.90 B: but how could be eliminate all the hate that you 

466.56 467.63 A: well i 

466.90 468.58 B: know if you go back 

468.64 476.26 A: maybe i'm a pacifist but i think i- if we would take and even though you would take them and mix everybody the same 

475.68 477.67 B: (( same they'd find something else mhm )) 

477.51 484.49 A: yeah and you know they would they would take and hate you for the kind of house that you have 

485.73 488.08 A: or the type of job that you have 

488.60 490.40 A: (( you know that )) 

490.46 493.95 A: they [sigh] some some idiot would come up with something different 

493.51 494.81 B: (( right right mhm mhm mhm )) 

494.29 496.21 A: that they can and hate you over 

496.79 499.30 A: so it it's a nice thought but 

500.49 504.17 A: just watching the watching the human the human nature is hm 

506.19 510.91 A: as as what it is you know some idiots would come up with something different 

511.25 512.17 A: (( but )) 

513.13 516.23 A: you could be the the finest person in the world 

517.21 522.79 A: and there'd be some bozo out there that'll find that would that would find something that they didn't like about you 

523.63 529.34 A: now maybe that you could take and go back in time and try to change that person 

530.57 531.65 A: (( you know )) 

532.32 533.71 A: that would be something 

532.96 535.01 B: now we're going somewhere [laughter] right mhm 

535.11 540.01 A: that would be something go back instead of trying to make everybody the same change the ones who are 

540.41 547.20 A: you know the the saddam husseins and the osama bin ladens and adolph hitler and you know 

547.86 552.78 A: change them that might be something to think about 

553.56 555.11 A: then you could take them 

555.55 558.14 A: then you would stand a better chance of having 

558.72 560.01 A: the peace 

560.15 561.86 A: along with the diversity you 

561.71 562.69 B: right
