77.16 86.52 A: [noise] lots of uh [noise] problems from and i i [noise] wasn't i almost always wear my seatbelt and of course that one day [sigh] i had not put my seatbelt on and uh 

77.54 78.13 B: (( mm )) 

85.56 87.44 B: oh my goodness 

86.87 99.46 A: ended up uh hit a airbag but i still kind of went flying hit the windshield and and suffered for a couple of years with you know problems uh [sigh] [lipsmack] i had post traumatic stress disorder all these kind of things that you know you

98.71 100.40 B: oh my god

105.42 106.90 B: (( wow [noise] )) 

106.00 120.68 A: i could have changed you know at the time it was like i was in a lot of pain but it went away and and then i thought that i was going to be fine but then it turned out [noise] that i started then having [noise] like all these the- these um depression type things and and you 

109.85 111.26 B: right right 

119.71 121.47 B: oh i can imagine 

120.86 128.58 A: know that that i didn't know where they were coming from [noise] and and i didn't realize [noise] that this uh accident had affect me affected me so much and uh 

127.85 129.20 B: (( oh my goodness )) 

128.44 139.28 A: i went to a psychologist for a while and stuff and so you know i had never done anything like that so i was [noise] really surprised at how much this one event [noise] [sigh] had changed my life and had had really you know caused a lot of [noise] 

137.16 138.07 B: oh 

139.25 149.94 A: [lipsmack] a lot of anguish for me and my wife especially too i mean my wife like had to [sigh] put up with uh you know a husband who [laughter] was depressed [noise] who didn't want to do anything around the house i didn't want to help out around the 

148.96 153.04 B: oh my but i can imagine i mean that is traumatic 

152.50 153.88 A: yeah so 

153.07 155.50 B: have you recuperated fully 

154.74 160.55 A: i'd say yeah i think you know [cough] i've kind of gotten over that and i stopped seeing a psychologist i was you know 

160.80 161.78 A: [sigh] uh 

162.78 166.24 A: i think i'm fine now you know i mean i still kind of get a little 

166.12 179.74 A: seeing accidents and stuff i get a little emotional and stuff you know it's really unfortunate that uh [sigh] but what had happened like also six months earlier there had been another member of the family who had who had died in a car crash so i think that kind of brought up a lot of those memories too and yeah 

168.41 170.06 B: yeah yeah yeah 

170.27 171.81 B: oh wow 

178.24 181.83 B: oh wow oh gosh i'm so sorry 

179.91 180.81 A: (( it's it's )) 

181.02 184.16 A: a bit of a bummer so you know it's like it's 

184.24 190.47 A: hypothetical you know that you could go back and change some you well i think we all know we probably never will whether we believe in uh 

185.64 186.46 B: [noise] 

191.72 199.44 A: or either the stuff you see on t._v. these days but uh [sigh] you know you just have to kind of cope with it w- with what's happened in the past and deal with it so 

197.01 197.80 B: [noise] 

197.98 198.88 B: [noise] 

199.23 205.83 B: oh god [noise] i can't [noise] i've been in a couple of [noise] car accidents myself but nothing as traumatic as yours 

205.21 206.32 A: yeah 

205.73 219.98 B: but um [noise] when i was in the service [noise] i had a car accident where i didn't injure [sigh] well i tried to avoid injuring somebody what happened was it it was a choice i had to make whether to go into incoming traffic [sigh] or hit a lady 

219.94 226.69 B: with a baby it wa- in a so i tr- i veered off into incoming traffic but i hit a light pole 

220.88 221.84 A: oh gosh 

226.65 236.94 B: [lipsmack] and i kind of went through the windshield myself [sigh] and i mean the the [sigh] i i guess you would know because i mean my face swell up to like twice the size 

229.01 230.24 A: yeah 

236.26 237.47 A: yeah 

236.80 250.71 B: black and blue my nose was fractured i mean it's traumatic so [sigh] i mean [sigh] [lipsmack] in a situation like that i don't know what you know [laughter] [sigh] what uh you could have done differently especially if it's not really your fault 

248.28 249.27 A: yeah 

250.11 263.17 A: right it's hard to you know you know maybe if i it was in a place that i don't normally go to if i had not gone that way that day you know or i made a different choice and not go there that day or or five minutes earlier i had you know er 

255.62 257.52 B: exactly 

258.28 260.71 B: yes see mhm 

263.65 266.33 A: you know done something different you know and so 

265.40 266.80 B: yeah 

266.64 269.54 A: [lipsmack] you know how 'bout you what type of thing might you uh 

269.35 282.04 B: [lipsmack] well with that situation i mean um if [sigh] not if really if i had a chance to do something different i think probably i wouldn't have [sigh] i would have went to school earlier [laughter] 

281.57 284.11 A: (( mhm do you mean to like college or )) 

281.94 283.44 B: [sigh] i would have went to 

283.27 290.93 B: yeah i went through with the coll- i've taken college courses and everything but i've never really gotten my degree my husband has we have six children now 

290.35 291.83 A: wow six 

290.70 303.15 B: [sigh] and i'm you know [laughter] i think which is why i'm implanting in my children now not necessarily getting a job but [sigh] trying to venture out and trying to do your own business 

302.54 303.64 A: yeah 

303.04 314.03 B: you know so i if i had a chance to do something um i think i probably would have went to school earlier [sigh] but my mom gave me a choice after high school she said either you go into the service [sigh] or you go directly to college 

313.28 315.47 A: and so so you went to the service and then 

314.51 316.46 B: and i went into the army 

315.85 317.40 A: (( met your husband )) 

316.77 327.34 B: and i didn't no actually i didn't meet my husband until like way after i came out of college i mean aft out of the [noise] service [sigh] but i think i would have went [noise] to school and pursue my education [noise] and gotten 

319.31 320.09 A: oh 

320.76 321.80 A: mhm 

327.14 338.76 B: [noise] you know [noise] when that direction first [noise] you know now i have children that um you know are taking c- college classes [noise] here and there and you know so i think i probably would have done that a little earlier [laughter] 

328.67 330.63 A: true yeah 

335.46 336.43 A: (( that's great )) 

337.50 345.50 A: yeah [laughter] as we get older i mean i had my kids when i was uh thirty eight it's my first two i have a three year old and a five year old you know 

342.20 343.23 B: okay 

344.47 346.24 B: oh wow 

345.54 356.45 A: and so [mn] you know i mean i could have gotten married earlier i just didn't meet the right girl you know [laughter] and uh but now you know and i i would say well i'll be more mature and will be well my body's a lot older and like you know
