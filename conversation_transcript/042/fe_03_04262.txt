74.52 78.39 B: yeah i you know i wh- when you start talking about major 

78.45 88.10 B: major world events [noise] you know you may want to go [sigh] i and i start to think about cause and effect so if the holocaust had never happened [noise] 

83.98 85.55 A: (( [noise] )) 

88.64 96.31 B: obviously there'd be six million jewish people a lot happier about that but at at the same time though 

93.46 94.24 A: (( [sigh] )) 

96.98 101.68 B: did that galvanizing effort by nazi germany 

101.74 108.71 B: uh galvanizing to world [noise] change uh create [noise] f- favorable situations 

109.05 110.70 B: (( for the )) 

113.22 114.14 A: (( uh )) 

114.54 115.29 A: (( you know )) 

115.72 116.57 A: (( somehow by )) 

116.88 122.21 A: (( [noise] fate or whatever we knew about it ahead of time and we had air marshalls on )) 

123.41 130.55 A: (( board and just as they began to act we just nail them all and they were able to prove you know what their intentions were without having the effect )) 

132.81 136.82 B: (( [noise] future world stability )) 

137.77 140.91 B: (( [noise] )) 

141.40 143.48 B: (( if that had )) 

144.36 145.03 B: (( it because )) 

145.04 145.54 B: (( it )) 

145.55 160.42 B: (( happened [noise] [noise] you can )) 

160.41 161.60 B: (( change the cause )) 

163.23 166.42 B: (( you could change the effect automatically you know )) 

167.28 168.06 A: (( hm )) 

167.92 170.99 B: okay so we've saved three thousand american lives 

171.56 177.62 B: would the american public have have uh stomached 

177.76 185.14 B: going into in afghanistan for that matter going into iraq the fact that we caught them all [noise] i think the answer clearly is no 

188.11 189.14 A: (( how do you mean )) 

189.28 193.22 A: i think we're we might be getting cut off 'cause i keep you keep going in and out um 

192.67 194.32 B: oh sorry 

193.39 194.31 A: that's okay 

194.37 195.30 A: um 

195.22 195.94 B: (( [noise] )) 

196.19 197.19 A: so 

197.95 200.62 A: (( wh- what do you th- what do you um )) 

201.63 202.83 B: well you just [noise] 

201.75 202.57 A: so 

203.04 205.05 B: y- you you [noise] start to wonder 

205.72 210.14 B: [noise] if we had have foiled that [noise] those three thousand lives were not lost 

210.01 221.86 B: the world trade centers are still standing [noise] w- would that have made the world a better place today well [noise] th- then you start to ask yourself again it goes back to this cause and effect so then you say to yourself okay 

211.86 212.75 A: uh-huh 

222.76 230.41 B: we foiled them we saved three thousand american lives but we'd also probably never go into afghanistan 

230.18 245.04 B: [noise] we'd probably never go into iraq for the weapons for mass destruction all that [noise] enthusiasm [noise] uh for the life of a better term then it was kind of mixed emotions until we just ran over iraq [sigh] all [noise] that was fueled [noise] by [noise] the idea that 

245.53 246.64 B: we could 

247.84 252.08 B: you know [noise] that we could change the future and it was driven by 

252.14 260.94 B: something horrible that happened in our past so that's that's where [noise] that's where i kind of have that's where i kind of have a problem with changing 

254.88 255.55 A: hm 

257.29 258.39 A: (( oh okay )) 

261.13 266.56 B: going back into in time and changing something [sigh] because of the cause and effect 

265.90 274.98 A: yeah i see what you're saying so because something was caused a long time ago um we were able this time making a new choice on how the effect 

273.76 274.62 B: that's it 

275.00 276.52 A: what the outcome would be 

276.33 282.82 B: exactly now there are other things though but i think [noise] as far as i'm concerned are pretty straight forward [sigh] 

283.20 289.63 B: if i could go back and change uh time that says that i would that we were able to discover 

289.93 292.24 B: uh polio vaccine 

292.34 294.12 B: two decades earlier 

294.99 301.15 B: or wipe out [sigh] you know uh small pox which which it reached the united states i guess 

301.38 308.85 B: could we have done that earlier there are things like that i think if we had have had those discoveries earlier uh 

308.96 318.65 B: what would the differences be in this world today suppose the suppose the united states was able to discover the same kind of technology advances that we have today and the computers and things like that 

318.93 321.31 B: uh or or anywhere in the world i guess 

321.36 330.61 B: two decades earlier would that same technology provide so many other benefits in terms of better fuel economy now two decades earlier now [sigh] 

331.51 336.52 B: uh medical advances because of that kind of technology e- earlier 

336.42 337.40 A: (( mhm )) 

337.10 342.55 B: so you just i- if there was something i was going to change that way and quite frankly one of one of the things that i think 

342.74 350.80 B: that has had a world impact in a positive way i will say in a positive way 'cause i i do think that the uh nine eleven [sigh] 

350.89 354.35 B: u- u- unlike a world war one and a world war two 

354.26 362.55 B: because of the modern day atmosphere and the global uh global uh communications and connections that we have around the world [sigh] 

362.40 374.02 B: i do think the nine eleven event is going to be generational changing i- it will have an an incredible long lasting effect for decades and decades to come [sigh] at the same time i think this whole 

374.26 378.49 B: technology revolution from computers to cell phones to [sigh] 

378.60 386.40 B: y- you name it it affects everything i'm i'm sitting here in my in my vehicle right now and there's electronics all around me that did not exist 

386.70 388.63 B: [sigh] uh a a dozen years ago 

388.16 389.96 A: mhm mhm 

389.57 392.53 B: and have they benefitted man well [sigh] 

393.25 400.58 B: i i'd say by and large they have 'cause of their applications elsewhere within within the overall um 

400.75 402.12 B: uh community 

403.96 404.54 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

404.04 407.96 B: but i i would like to discover that ten years earlier i wish [sigh] i wish 

408.06 409.08 B: (( you know )) 

409.45 417.72 B: um what's his name microsoft's guy billy boy i wish he was born ten years earlier maybe he'd thought maybe he would have thought of this stuff ten years earlier 

414.32 415.32 A: [laughter] 

417.48 419.25 A: (( yeah um )) 

418.51 420.00 B: (( i don't know what do you think )) 

420.28 423.00 A: i'm a mac guy myself [laughter] 

422.50 423.64 B: well yeah yeah 

423.17 424.70 A: yeah uh 

424.75 438.73 A: yeah i know i'm uh but i think i think like things like polio and the people that get involved um now may have been affected by the technology that happened then and and like you know i'm diabetic and and right now i have an insulin pump in me [sigh] and uh 

437.69 438.79 B: there you go 

438.61 450.54 A: i mean it's the greatest thing in the world three days you know a a kids kids get them now and they they can eat whatever they want they gauge it and then they give themselves as much insulin as they need it just sits on your side you get a little i._v. it's got like a little uh fibre 

446.13 447.29 B: yeah 

450.44 459.70 A: um in- intravenous needle kind of thing it doesn't even hurt it just sits there [sigh] and it pumps you with n- insulin it just you know and it's great and i'm thinking 

458.69 460.85 B: yeah but let me let me ask you this 

460.33 461.10 A: what 

461.06 472.95 B: if those discoveries had been made a decade earlier due to other tech- technology advances you right might you m- right now might have either an external an external wrist watch 

464.02 465.09 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

465.53 466.54 A: oh yeah 

468.71 469.56 A: might have 

469.59 471.03 A: something inside 

472.45 473.65 A: yep yeah 

472.95 481.09 B: that doesn't require any kind of i._d. that has some kind of a transdermal uh [noise] delivery of the drug or whatever else but it's also 

479.76 482.05 A: i've heard that there is there actually works that stuff 

482.14 493.00 B: yeah i mean so you know i mean uh or or something that's implantable that lasts because it has a a nuclear safe uh chemical reaction in it that is guaranteed for twenty five years 

488.62 489.54 A: (( [laughter] )) 

490.88 491.58 A: (( huh )) 

493.01 500.06 A: i don't know well how can we change it now so that something like this can be um effective later on 

499.92 508.24 B: ah well here's the thing [sigh] e- every time everyone t- when you talk about hypothetical situations going back in time to change things 

508.28 511.85 B: those are those are uh you know wish lists 

511.39 512.70 A: (( oh i know mhm )) 

512.16 517.90 B: th- the difference moving forward is the er the uh willingness 

517.77 529.45 B: [sigh] to take risks to invest in things that seem a little hair brain and i tell you what in the commie that we've had lately with the war and everything else like that the stock market you know everything that's going on 

529.92 538.35 B: [sigh] you know er the american public a- and now i'm going to keep this localized to the american public er but it also kind of applies to the global economy [sigh] 

538.68 553.56 B: we're not interested in you know it's like kaslow's uh i mean maslow's uh hierarchy of needs you know right now those nice to haves we're not going to talk about those we're just trying to figure out if we can re- still retire at age sixty five let alone working to seventy two 

553.54 565.90 B: [sigh] and working and we're w- worried about paying for our health care benefits and how are we going to put a kid through college because it's getting more and more expensive [sigh] and when you start telling those same peo- you start telling those same people but you know what go ahead 

560.96 564.59 A: yeah yes you know it's the long term 

564.69 568.84 A: you've got to look after the long term and the short term will take care of itself i 

568.18 578.99 B: uh but when everything's rolling when you're on the dot com bubble sure let's invest in that risk that risk technology now everybody's retrenching [sigh] holding in 

572.24 573.19 A: yeah 

574.24 575.12 A: yeah 

577.80 586.23 A: yeah it's like it's like yeah it's like change would never occur it's like w- well i'm not a real bush fan um but uh 

586.15 599.89 A: it's almost like you know the sixties were denial i mean like there was a lot there was a lot of positive stuff that also took place at that time in history i'm thinking about like john lennon uh you know is he able to like question and and open you know
