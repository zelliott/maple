138.41 139.74 B: [noise] uh-huh wow 

139.13 146.86 A: and i i guess the only thing i'd change is um trying to go to uh a more prestigious school 

147.09 156.94 A: not that not that i didn't do well uh with the university of buffalo but i would give anything you know now to have gone to a place like harvard for example for my m._b._a. 

147.11 148.00 B: (( oh )) 

157.21 158.75 A: i think it's um 

157.25 159.09 B: (( mhm )) 

159.24 171.22 A: um at the time i didn't have the opportunity but or the money [laughter] for that matter but um that's probably the only one regret uh and i'm not sure it's really a regret just something i might do over 

163.79 166.65 B: (( [noise] oh yeah [laughter] it's pretty expensive )) 

171.00 185.08 B: [noise] [noise] yeah i don't really know what well i think uh talking about school i may have tried to apply to more schools and thought maybe gone to a more prestigious school as well but i don't know if that would change much 

186.06 190.46 A: no i don't think it would change well maybe open some different opportunities 

189.53 198.45 B: yeah some different opportunities but not nothing significant it's not like i'm unhappy with where i am is 

190.97 192.09 A: mhm 

192.72 193.64 A: (( but [sigh] )) 

198.63 203.26 B: there's other things that i could have done but i don't know if i'd be happy with those things either 

203.03 204.33 A: (( mhm [mn] [noise] [mn] )) 

204.22 208.52 B: i well i i'm just doing um mainly computer science work which is 

209.13 222.19 B: i'm doing some consulting right now i'm in uh technical support i work in engineering and i just feel the grind of just working every day [laughter] you know 

220.61 222.18 A: (( mhm yeah [noise] )) 

222.15 232.88 B: so maybe if i'd gone to a better technical school and really focused on a couple of things i could go into research or something like that which is a little different 

232.24 236.53 A: yeah it's the i'm sure there's still pressure just just a different kind 

235.95 242.83 B: yeah it's a different kind so it's a [mn] it's one of those things where the grass is seems always greener on the other side but may not be 

242.64 243.20 A: (( [cough] )) 

243.26 244.18 A: yeah

262.70 263.88 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

265.21 270.09 A: back then it was more usual to get married right after you finished um college 

270.52 277.00 A: but then i went to graduate school and uh we had kids and both worked and you know worked out fine 

272.19 275.93 B: (( mhm )) 

276.59 278.20 B: [noise] yeah [noise] 

278.32 285.87 A: um i've always traveled a lot so you know we were used to um i'm used to being gone you know for weeks at a time 

285.45 286.98 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

286.99 288.10 B: and i i

291.78 292.85 B: uh-huh that's 

295.31 299.05 B: yeah that's pretty i've been out of the country a couple of times 

298.43 299.94 A: mhm whereabouts 

299.47 304.24 B: uh well i've been to taiwan and i've been to mexico [laughter] 

301.19 302.09 A: uh-huh 

303.46 306.13 A: okay well you're pretty close to mexico 

305.16 313.02 B: yeah pretty close to mexico so [cough] been over to mexico like two or three times and been in taiwan about the same number of times 

306.22 307.51 A: yeah 

312.07 313.07 A: mhm 

313.89 315.60 B: but it's not not too bad 

315.75 324.23 B: like i said there's a lot of things well maybe i would like to change but i don't know if i would really like to change after i'd seen the results 

324.80 327.80 A: [lipsmack] yeah i think so i mean uh 

328.68 332.42 A: i don't know have to think more about it than just off the cuff to uh 

331.83 333.10 B: yeah 

332.43 334.81 A: think about what i might want to change 

334.72 344.32 B: [noise] yeah i don't see anything that's really life changing like if if certain point of my life i did something different then i would become a totally different person 

335.11 336.22 A: certainly [noise] [noise] 

344.51 346.04 A: right 

346.38 349.91 A: so is this the first call that you've done with this uh 

348.89 351.57 B: this is actually my third call [noise] 

350.91 358.06 A: oh this is the first one i've done i've i've gotten several calls but i've always been uh busy at the time so 

356.06 357.04 B: (( oh )) 

357.86 362.20 B: i think this is my last one it's pretty neat this linguistics uh 

362.66 366.07 B: [noise] kinda research and get paid for it 

363.94 364.92 A: mhm 

365.69 366.90 A: yeah 

366.62 367.61 B: so 

367.75 372.13 A: one one thing i you know i'm getting back to the education that uh i 

368.06 369.87 B: (( not too bad )) 

370.41 373.84 B: mhm 

372.74 380.70 A: i don't know if i regret it i might have thought harder about it wa- after i got my master's degree i seriously considered going for my phd [lipsmack] 

379.96 381.30 B: mhm 

380.81 388.75 A: and um i i always liked teaching in fact i'm an adjunct professor at both u. of h. and uh coupla other schools here 

388.57 390.06 B: oh that's pretty neat 

389.42 394.25 A: yeah i like that bent um it's a different kind of a outlet and different kind of 

394.45 399.67 A: satisfaction so maybe you know i would um think about doing that next time 

399.27 400.65 B: yeah 

399.49 409.88 A: but at but at the time you know i needed to get a job and get some money [laughter] so uh didn't do that and of course then you get busy with your career and um 

403.08 404.67 B: [laughter] 

406.25 407.85 B: yeah 

408.55 411.33 B: it just it becomes really hard 

410.17 412.37 A: ri- right to go back again 

412.20 419.17 B: yeah i think if there was no like money constraints i knew i was going to be successful in whatever 

419.34 423.54 B: you know pursuit then there's a lot of things i'd want to change 

420.54 421.47 A: uh-huh 

423.64 424.73 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] )) 

423.97 424.91 B: but then 

424.92 437.30 B: let's say you go back to a point in time where you could have been a teacher gotten your phd or done something else then make the same decision again it would still you'd still have to think about it it's not 

437.46 441.87 B: there's really no definite answer 'cause there's always a risk to 

441.54 442.97 A: (( [sigh] [noise] oh absolutely )) 

442.01 443.71 B: doing something else 

443.07 444.28 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

444.91 450.64 B: [noise] so well i guess i knew i'd be successful i'd i'd do things a lot differently but at the same 

450.72 457.77 B: um along the same lines if i knew what i knew then maybe i'd make the same choice again 

456.14 458.95 A: [sigh] [noise] [noise] yeah i was yeah that's true 

460.02 465.59 A: [cough] i don't know whether i would have or not 'cause i really uh enjoyed school and could have gone on 

465.67 467.31 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

466.34 469.53 A: but i enjoy being out too so [laughter] 

468.17 470.79 B: [laughter] yeah but i mean i think 

471.12 480.56 B: yeah i enjoy kind of enjoy i pretty much enjoy what i'm doing it's interesting work and i just don't see myself doing this for another ten years 

480.21 482.73 A: [noise] mhm yeah i under i hear ya 

481.00 484.74 B: [laughter] maybe 

483.44 488.60 A: i've had i've had uh oh i've been with four companies since i left 

488.08 488.80 B: (( [noise] )) 

488.84 492.19 A: which makes it a little interesting 'cause then you um see different 

490.58 494.89 B: (( mhm )) 

492.83 498.49 A: ways of operating and uh some some of the good things and some of the bad things are the same 

498.68 501.95 A: but um so i've had kind of a varied career 

501.84 514.92 B: that's pretty good i've been with one company the same one but i have gone from engineering to support and i've seen the company grow shrink and uh start growing again 

502.38 503.78 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

514.64 515.72 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

515.79 516.35 A: (( [noise] )) 

516.48 523.77 B: so it [cough] it's been pretty interesting and we do a lot we provide a lot of the content management services to 

523.72 534.74 B: um chemical companies and pharmaceutical anything that's heavily process oriented so i don't know maybe some of your clients have probably have used it before [laughter] 

529.47 530.37 A: mhm 

534.60 536.63 A: what's the name what what co- 

534.82 543.09 B: so [cough] documentum we do content management uh we'll manage the plant drawings uh operating procedures 

536.82 537.87 A: documentum 

542.43 543.37 A: (( mhm )) 

543.10 551.13 B: stick it in the machine it's similar to a database but it's a lot more complex and you can apply workloads business processes to those 

550.47 551.39 A: mhm 

551.19 561.37 B: and um sign off on them send them to the right people uh really just model any type of business process even between companies so if you want to 

560.35 563.56 A: are most of your clients here in uh in houston [noise] 

563.49 575.99 B: um we most of our most of the clients i deal with are in the east coast because a lot of the pharmaceuticals the ones in houston are mainly like the oil companies 

568.73 569.63 A: mhm 

570.79 571.60 A: right 

576.05 580.11 B: um the engineering companies companies you know you got bechtel exxon 

576.31 577.44 A: right 

580.16 581.08 A: mhm 

580.54 582.16 B: um texaco 

583.27 596.00 B: just because they they have they're process oriented anything that's process oriented will will need something need a content management system and it helps them become a lot more paperless whilst uh 

595.82 596.86 A: mhm 

596.47 599.95 B: engineering will do a drawing they'll route it around get the
