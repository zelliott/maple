0.51 2.32 A: hey what's up 

1.75 4.42 B: not too bad my name's pete how you doing [cough] 

3.64 5.45 A: i'm fine my name's earle 

5.30 6.07 B: earle 

6.10 7.37 B: nice talking to you 

6.11 7.00 A: yeah 

8.10 11.32 B: um i guess the topic is going back in time 

10.62 14.12 A: yeah and changing what you would what to change i guess 

14.17 17.11 B: i think the one thing i would change is probably going to college 

16.95 20.51 A: college did you not go to it or did you go to it or mhm [noise] 

17.61 18.40 B: yeah 

19.91 22.00 B: i went for three months 

22.18 25.15 B: and i thought it actually i thought it was uh 

22.32 23.18 A: mhm 

25.57 26.13 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

26.56 30.78 B: it wasn't structured enough they didn't care if you came or not you know 

28.43 29.01 A: (( [noise] )) 

30.92 32.40 B: and it was a little bit 

31.08 32.42 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

32.71 34.97 B: since it didn't have structure it wasn't uh 

35.09 38.06 B: i wasn't able to apply myself how 'bout yourself 

38.51 43.40 A: [sigh] i don't know i'm still in high school currently sir but um i don't know what i would change 

41.28 41.84 B: (( [cough] )) 

43.59 48.61 A: maybe is it in my course or the course of history or what is it do you know 

48.98 50.38 B: excuse me 

49.79 56.74 A: is it in the course of your life like you mean like is the question asking about your life or is it asking about like history in general what would you change 

56.06 58.10 B: no uh no in your life 

57.95 60.48 A: in my life hm i don't know 

58.68 64.66 B: yeah what what would you ch- what would you go back and change in your life if you could change it that was the question [cough] 

63.52 69.28 A: i think once in middle school actually i got in a fight with some kid 'cause he was saying some racist comments 

69.20 70.23 B: mhm 

69.62 74.49 A: and i shouldn't have even gone there 'cause he was like oh don't walk away 

74.00 74.81 B: (( [cough] )) 

74.67 79.93 A: and then i went up and i punched him in the face and i got suspended and all this other bad stuff happened 

76.70 77.50 B: (( mm )) 

79.94 82.72 A: i probably could have avoided that something i could 

81.75 83.42 B: how about himself was he 

83.45 85.37 B: was he um also expelled 

85.73 86.83 A: was he what 

86.81 88.16 B: expelled also 

87.92 91.05 A: oh he no he was suspended actually but yeah 

89.94 90.83 B: okay 

91.07 92.05 B: you're both 

91.17 92.76 A: he was suspended as well 

92.42 94.30 B: right 

93.67 94.78 A: but yeah 

95.21 97.06 A: are there any other things you would change 

96.95 97.57 B: (( [cough] [lipsmack] )) 

97.96 99.02 B: um 

101.13 107.00 B: [sigh] probably well the well going to sch- well going to college would have changed my life um 

106.03 110.23 A: yeah definitely so you dropped out after 'cause it wasn't suiting you or mhm 

109.86 113.85 B: it just wasn't um well i didn't think it was important and um 

113.89 116.00 B: like i said it wasn't structured enough 

117.13 124.35 B: that uh forced me to go i guess i say but looking back i'm i'm pretty intelligent [laughter] you know 

123.25 124.61 A: [laughter] 

124.60 127.50 B: in math i was always real good in math 

126.93 127.98 A: mhm 

127.69 131.07 B: and i'm thinking if i'd have went to college maybe i would have learned 

131.21 134.09 B: uh math and i probably would have got into one of the sciences 

134.07 135.12 A: yeah 

134.61 142.18 B: and in my and i loved to r- like watch science uh channels and i like to see to see things that are 

138.38 141.57 A: (( [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

142.61 144.86 B: uh science oriented 

144.97 151.49 B: and i think something like that would have been really interesting to invent stuff and to watch stuff being invented 

148.04 149.13 A: yeah 

151.43 160.12 A: i think something else i would do is [sigh] go back to my freshman year of high school and maybe start trying 'cause i didn't really try throughout my high school years 

159.60 160.80 B: right 

160.19 165.52 A: and now i don't know if i'm going to get into a good college and it's going to affect my entire life just 'cause i didn't 

165.53 168.98 A: give my full effort into w- my work and everything like that [laughter] 

169.91 172.34 B: i can see your i can see your dilemma 

172.84 176.74 B: but there's always to make a suggestion there's always 

176.80 178.97 B: a like a junior college 

178.70 179.98 A: yeah that's true 

179.08 187.34 B: if you don't think you had really good scores you could go to maybe a year or two at junior college and really apply yourself since now you know 

184.59 185.65 A: yeah 

187.65 189.76 B: how important grades are 

190.07 194.56 B: for a couple of years you could really apply yourself and and get your grades way up there 

193.95 197.94 A: [noise] yep and transfer into a nice college or you know and just graduate at another 

196.11 197.54 B: right 

197.84 199.61 B: (( yeah )) 

199.30 206.16 A: one yeah it's probably what i'm going to have to do i don't know i wanted to go to u._s._c. that's like my dream but it's a lot of money too 

204.55 205.37 B: mhm 

206.09 207.86 B: yeah do you live near u._s._c. 

207.94 211.07 A: ah yeah i live in uh southern california area 

210.68 215.03 B: okay i live on the other side other coast on uh south carolina 

214.71 215.71 A: oh you do 

215.36 218.31 B: oh yeah um 

216.15 217.34 A: (( cool cool )) 

218.83 220.09 B: yeah i think uh 

220.21 223.06 B: i think 'cause i love to learn anyway 

222.92 223.95 A: mhm 

223.46 229.63 B: and um i'm constantly reading and constantly looking at stuff and constantly 

229.86 231.37 B: trying to learn things 

231.47 232.80 B: and i think uh 

233.23 235.15 B: i think college would have been 

235.22 237.63 A: something that could have definitely changed your life 

237.28 238.80 B: yep 

238.64 251.27 A: yeah i'm pretty much opposite i don't like learning but i do it 'cause i know i want to have a good future in life yeah i don't enjoy reading so i try not to read [laughter] only if there's school assignments stuff like that i mainly play video games 

243.94 245.01 B: right 

247.44 248.70 B: (( [laughter] [lipsmack] )) 

251.05 251.94 B: oh l- 

251.67 253.75 A: life of a normal kid [laughter] 

253.70 256.36 B: yup when i first um i guess when i 

256.43 267.91 B: mm i have two kids and when they first were uh born you know and as they grew up i played with them you know i play video games and baseball and things like that but but video games really don't turn [laughter] me on too much 

263.10 264.07 A: yeah 

267.60 268.73 A: mhm 

268.10 270.45 B: i like going out there and actually um 

270.97 278.42 B: you know doing stuff i like staying active i'm a carpenter by trade so i like to build stuff and uh 

272.26 273.30 A: yeah 

274.87 276.02 A: mhm 

277.27 278.25 A: yeah 

278.97 280.94 B: but i think college would have been 

281.82 283.75 B: would have made a lot of difference to my life 

283.80 285.50 A: yeah definitely 

285.64 292.07 B: what is your interest uh other interest do you have besides video games as far as as far as education 

289.37 290.58 A: (( uh [laughter] )) 

291.90 296.17 A: well i don't know i was hoping to maybe go to a bus- a good business school maybe even 

296.38 297.56 B: mhm 

296.94 304.13 A: or u._s._c. somewhere i don't know like i don't know what i want to do specifically in business but i just kind of want to own my own company and you know 

298.52 299.28 B: right 

304.00 304.92 B: right 

304.32 306.32 A: be really successful and 

306.39 306.95 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

306.71 307.88 A: normal dream 

307.62 312.80 B: well if you think about it uh george bush um the president he has an m._b._a. 

313.01 314.13 A: oh he does 

313.64 319.94 B: yes and um an m._b._a. you can work anywhere if you have a a college degree with an m._b._a. 

320.33 322.78 B: you can work anywhere because every 

323.25 324.54 B: every business 

324.65 326.24 B: everything you do is a business 

326.33 327.45 A: yeah that's 

326.79 330.79 B: whether it's your own business or it's uh wormald or it's um 

330.51 331.28 A: (( yeah )) 

330.93 335.05 B: any s- any business you need a business manager 

335.15 335.72 A: (( yeah )) 

335.45 339.76 B: and somebody that has a masters in business uh could work anywhere 

339.78 340.75 A: mhm 

340.42 343.87 B: but um the sky's the limit i guess [sigh] 

343.29 344.57 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

344.83 349.14 B: i think another area that's really growing is the medical medical field 

348.71 352.26 A: oh definitely and it's getting a lot more competitive as it's growing 

349.80 350.66 B: um 

352.59 356.68 B: and uh now that requires a lot of college [laughter] 

356.00 365.47 A: yeah it does which is why i used to always want to be a doctor or something but then i don't know it's just the the years in college kind of turned me off on it 

357.15 358.24 B: uh you talk 

359.68 360.90 B: right 

365.77 373.49 B: well an alternative to that would be going to into um into radiology or um being a male nurse or 

373.19 374.13 A: mhm 

373.69 374.46 B: uh 

374.59 377.46 B: uh pharmacology something in that field that way 

377.55 378.72 B: you're not as 

379.12 379.71 B: (( er )) 

379.72 382.92 B: you're not as liable as a doctor you know 

381.15 382.09 A: yeah 

382.62 383.53 A: yeah 

383.44 387.92 B: but you're still in the medical field and it's very good 

387.33 392.92 A: yeah lately i've been thinking about maybe becoming a [noise] dentist but that requires a lot of schooling as well but 

390.38 391.18 B: yeah 

393.75 396.77 A: it's not as demanding as becoming a doctor that's for sure 

396.65 398.10 B: yeah how how are 

398.39 401.66 B: are there a lot of dentists in in california a 

401.08 402.69 A: oh yeah there's lots 

402.35 403.55 B: (( lot of them um )) 

402.83 406.38 A: my dad's friend's a dentist and he seems to be very successful sorry 

406.82 414.45 B: the thing now about dentists um talking about school about is that dentists try to save teeth [laughter] 

413.82 415.20 A: (( what was that )) 

415.01 419.45 B: the dentists try to save teeth they used to just pull them out and put false teeth in 

418.50 420.34 A: (( y- yeah i know )) 

419.84 423.02 B: now they try to s- save teeth so they're kind of um 

423.20 424.17 A: (( mhm )) 

423.46 427.57 B: i guess they're keeping their their profession alive [laughter] 

426.88 428.00 A: yeah 

428.63 432.26 B: but yeah dentistry i think there's a lot of dentists out there 

432.14 433.06 A: mhm 

432.89 438.72 B: and i think that's one area that of the medical field that there might be a little bit too many of 

438.58 439.49 A: (( oh )) 

439.35 442.82 B: in in my opinion of course what what do i know [laughter] [sigh] 

440.39 441.49 A: yeah 

441.86 442.84 A: [laughter] 

445.12 448.52 A: yeah uh back on topic is there anything else you would want to change 

449.11 450.47 A: other than college 

451.12 455.80 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] well if i went to college it would change it would've changed a lot of things um 

458.67 460.07 B: [mn] that's hard [noise] 

460.37 465.63 A: make sure you're kids know how important college is to you so they don't mess up in their life 

465.00 468.53 B: well i'm trying to do that that i got one that's um 

468.99 475.14 B: that's been out of school two been out of school two years and he's uh manager managing a restaurant 

474.88 476.07 A: (( oh that's nice )) 

475.98 478.59 B: and the other one just got out of high school and he's 

478.81 482.31 B: he's in the year i'm going to wait a year and decide [laughter] 

481.68 482.90 A: [laughter] 

482.34 492.16 B: so he's still he's thinking about going he's got a few months to decide [sigh] of course right here where we live there's a lot of um like tech schools 

486.48 487.52 A: (( to decide )) 

487.80 488.60 A: yeah 

491.90 492.85 A: mhm 

492.94 501.48 B: and he's going to probably take some tech courses to keep his mind active until he decides what he wants he wants to go into um 

497.47 498.51 A: yeah 

501.75 504.04 B: uh arts management 

503.43 504.74 A: mhm 

504.06 506.01 B: he wants to manage one of these big 

506.48 507.30 B: uh 

507.39 510.53 B: boy bands or uh something like that you know 

510.20 511.60 A: oh yeah 

510.99 513.92 B: sort of like a m- sort of like a uh agent 

513.35 514.75 A: oh yeah yeah 

514.34 516.48 B: so he he wants to do that and th- and 

516.74 521.60 B: there's a college in charleston in south carolina that has a major in that 

521.03 522.12 A: (( oh wow )) 

521.63 527.35 B: there's there's a brand new major arts management and uh he's really interested in that 'cause he he's he's 

527.37 529.13 B: he works at a theater now 

528.87 529.79 A: mhm 

529.60 530.68 B: (( and um )) 

530.53 532.07 A: that'd be really fun though 

531.95 537.00 B: yeah he is really he likes singing and dancing and things like that 

536.43 537.49 A: that's cool 

537.30 538.49 B: so he's um 

538.55 542.21 B: art manager art management is his his thing 

541.60 542.88 A: (( [laughter] )) 

546.96 552.39 B: so you're not too old to change the line of things i'm a little bit older than you are um and uh 

549.70 553.08 A: yeah yeah [laughter] yeah i'm only sixteen 

552.68 554.19 B: yeah i'm in my forties 

553.86 554.99 A: (( oh wow drastically )) 

554.92 565.16 B: so there's a lot of things that i guess i would change but i think if i'd had i changed that one thing it would have drastically changed the rest of my life and i would have 

563.74 564.71 A: yeah 

565.51 568.12 B: you know a totally different view of things 

568.44 569.00 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

569.66 572.23 B: how long have we been talking [laughter] 

570.98 574.85 A: mhm i don't know it seems like it's been what too it seems like it's been a while actually 

574.46 578.68 B: it does i think they're supposed to give you a warning when it gets up toward 

578.02 581.21 A: to ten minutes and also like you have thirty seconds to 

581.16 582.98 B: this is my first call as a matter of fact 

582.65 589.28 A: oh it is okay yeah well my first time i didn't even know what we were supposed to do [sigh] so i thought i was talking to an answering machine 

588.94 590.33 B: (( okay well um )) 

589.53 599.89 A: so i was just talking for like five minutes and then finally i hear another guy on the other side of the receiver and he's like ah okay is it my turn [laughter] [laughter] but yeah it it'll give uh you a little w- 

596.47 597.63 B: oh wow
