84.57 88.11 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well is it because you were drunk or just carried away

92.87 94.44 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

93.38 97.78 B: i am i'm a recovering alcoholic so i [sigh] i was sober at the time so 

95.13 96.31 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

96.91 99.92 A: well let me ask you did you end up marrying her 

97.82 99.45 B: that kind of made it a little more 

99.76 106.59 B: yes i did i ended up married h- married her [sigh] and we've been married for six years now and we have two beautiful daughters so 

104.36 105.00 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

105.55 109.01 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] well i wouldn't even think about it any more 

108.50 112.89 B: no i i don't think about it but it's it's something that i would go back and change but 

109.35 110.27 A: oh [noise] 

112.10 113.27 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

112.96 122.87 B: um but a lot of my well a lot of my uh life growing up uh there's a lot of things i wouldn't change i mean i [sigh] i was a troubled kid troubled teenager into drugs and alcohol and uh 

121.68 122.82 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

123.01 133.72 B: i was in treatment a couple of times but [sigh] all of that uh all of that experience really helped me in the profession that i er that i work um in now and [sigh] that's that's a 

124.27 125.53 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

132.57 136.94 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well it seems to build stronger character for you all of this 

135.92 137.97 B: yeah yeah it it sure has [sigh] 

137.34 151.29 A: and i think it's fantastic that you can talk about it is it easy to talk to a stranger about it than um [mn] than people you know or were you in uh deep therapy that you could that you feel that you can talk about it [noise] 

150.40 158.39 B: [sigh] no i i wasn't in therapy or anything but uh the bachelor party i i i'm embarrassed by it so i i rarely bring that up at all 

153.49 154.42 A: [noise] 

155.76 156.71 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

157.81 163.52 A: well maybe it's happ- actually maybe it it happened in the s- in the w- w- weird sense for the best 

158.59 159.68 B: (( so so )) 

163.39 173.30 A: because it might have just brought things to the surface [noise] and uh you're able to face a lot of underlying things that um that you never recognized before 

172.82 174.11 B: (( [sigh] yeah it it )) 

173.24 178.90 A: and they came out in in a very strange negative way [noise] but you were able to face it [noise] 

178.35 187.15 B: yeah in a in a sense yeah and [sigh] you know in in the long run it actually made our [sigh] our uh our our marriage probably stronger just because you know so 

181.31 182.79 A: [noise] 

185.13 191.69 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] but that's what i really mean that's what i mean because it's when sometimes there are a lot of underlying things that we feel 

191.47 196.36 A: and we're not in touch with [sigh] and when something happens and um 

196.14 209.70 A: we're kind of embarrassed or guilty about it or whatever [noise] [sigh] we're able to face it and if you're able to really [noise] be able to face it with her and talk about it [noise] [sigh] uh you probably came out much stronger about it and you can talk about anything [noise] [noise] 

198.06 198.95 B: right 

207.47 209.16 B: yeah see i think so 

209.29 212.94 B: yeah [sigh] i think so so how 'bout you what would you go back and change 

211.72 224.87 A: [sigh] well i would go back and change [noise] the man i lived with for about four years [noise] um [sigh] but actually [noise] what happened was that i wasn't ready for a real relationship 

224.87 237.28 A: [noise] so it was a very you know very superficial relationship [sigh] uh too very good looking people he had a lot of money we [noise] travelled we but it's very superficial [sigh] but i didn't like him [noise] 

237.49 238.74 B: (( [lipsmack] oh mhm )) 

238.16 245.73 A: uh i loved him [noise] and i didn't like him and i never and i knew how to marry him if i wanted to and i knew i didn't want to marry him 

245.76 249.22 A: (( [noise] so um [noise] i was um [lipsmack] )) 

249.26 264.03 A: i mean you know i shouldn't have been in the relationship to start out with [noise] but the fact was i was there and i enjoyed it for what it was and it would've lasted probably a long time except that he moved to florida [noise] [sigh] so that really ended it basically 

263.55 265.74 B: and you didn't want to move down to florida with him 

265.03 273.21 A: well he didn't ask me [laughter] and i might have moved but i really never liked him but the interesting thing was that years later 

266.28 267.73 B: oh okay [laughter] 

273.03 282.38 A: he called me periodically and the more he called me the more i disliked him [noise] [sigh] and one time when i was in florida i saw him [sigh] and he had gone through like two marriages 

282.19 291.04 A: [noise] and two children but he was in military background and very disturbed guy had a lot of problems i always felt there was a very dark side to him 

290.68 291.64 B: oh 

291.00 300.41 A: [noise] um that i couldn't really put my finger on but i knew it was there and it came out years after uh when i met him he was heavy into drugs and drinking 

292.45 293.01 B: (( [cough] )) 

300.83 304.80 A: [noise] and i had a very strange reaction i was very happy 

305.13 311.12 A: [laughter] [noise] i was very happy to see him destroyed [noise] it's terrible [laughter] 

305.51 307.16 B: well what do you mean you were happy 

308.90 309.99 B: (( oh [sigh] )) 

311.10 320.71 A: and i didn't feel guilty about it 'cause i just felt that this was not a nice person [noise] [sigh] and um i'd seen him [noise] afterwards he gained a lot of weight and 

320.48 332.05 A: he lost everything he had but we never had anything it was very very superficial [noise] [sigh] so that was probably the biggest mistake because i wasted a lot of years [noise] [sigh] and i shouldn't have been in it 

331.83 336.30 A: [noise] [lipsmack] and i think the biggest [noise] thing that's missing in my life is having children 

336.73 337.95 B: you don't have children 

337.01 343.23 A: [noise] [noise] no i don't have children and and so i never really married and i love children and i love animals [noise] 

338.77 339.89 B: well it 

343.43 347.85 A: and i think that is the biggest loss in my sense in in my life 

347.79 350.88 B: okay so it's probably good that you never had any with him then 

350.30 362.96 A: [noise] [sigh] oh i wouldn't i i wouldn't have married him because when [noise] uh every time i pulled back [noise] he was so neurotic that he'd call crazy it's it's you know i always kept my own apartment because i always felt which was very interesting 

350.97 352.15 B: i mean i mean 

362.78 370.70 A: i kept my apartment i lived with him in his apartment but i always kept my apartment 'cause i never felt [noise] this would really end up as a permanent thing [noise] 

370.38 371.73 B: oh so for 

370.96 376.90 A: and i came back monday nights i used to come back to my apartment [noise] to just to be alone [noise] 

377.07 385.72 A: and he would call [noise] and i wouldn't pick up the phone there's a very sadistic part of me [laughter] i really i really disliked this man [mn] [cough] [noise] 

381.87 383.43 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

384.40 388.19 B: so how how can you how can you not like him but love him how does that work 

387.95 389.21 A: well [noise] 

389.47 401.86 A: it was superficial it was a good a very good lifestyle he was very handsome um we looked good together he had it was a very good life he had a house in the hamptons i live in new york where do you live 

401.51 403.41 B: i i live in uh minnesota 

402.33 414.73 A: [noise] [noise] oh okay so he had a house in the hamptons which is very lovely and a boat and we used to go you know eat lobster dinners and v- ver- have a very big social life we travelled a lot [sigh] 

410.23 411.34 B: (( wow )) 

414.07 415.86 B: so you liked the lifestyle 

414.97 422.72 A: [noise] i loved the lifestyle that's what it was all about [noise] [sigh] now when i met him he was going with a girlfriend's sister of mine 

417.52 418.48 B: okay 

423.14 428.53 A: [noise] and uh we were at a party i'll never forget it [noise] [sigh] and he was really very handsome 

428.50 435.05 A: and i looked at him and i says when was the last time you took a champagne bubble bath with somebody [laughter] 

433.24 434.61 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

435.04 447.70 A: [laughter] and sure enough i got a call [laughter] [sigh] and two weeks later he invited me he was going to mexico he invited me so i went [noise] so that's how the relationship started and it was always on a [noise] a very superficial [noise] basis 

447.28 450.94 B: right so how old are you now if you don't mind me asking yeah 

450.27 451.71 A: [noise] uh how old 

451.74 453.08 A: i'm forty seven [noise] 

452.64 453.50 B: okay 

453.11 458.87 A: [noise] so um so i can still get married [laughter] [mn] i still could how old are you 

456.02 457.80 B: (( oh yeah you still have plenty of time )) 

458.60 460.02 B: i'm thirty two [sigh] 

459.48 460.49 A: [noise] uh-huh 

460.80 462.63 A: [noise] but so what other 

462.64 470.27 A: [noise] i mean those that was a big thing i mean there are a lot of little things that you'd like to change but they're not important it's really the big things [noise] [noise] 

469.35 475.79 B: another big thing that i probably would change and this is i think probably something that any everybody would want to change is [sigh] 

474.26 475.14 A: [noise] 

476.01 483.34 B: when when someone passes away having spent more time with that person just because you don't know when they're going to leave 

481.95 483.02 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

483.25 484.97 A: [noise] you mean before [noise] 

484.42 494.11 B: yeah before you know [sigh] you know i i and i think that's with everybody though once someone leaves it's that that loss that you feel and [sigh] wanting to spend more time with them just before 

485.41 486.25 A: [noise] 

486.40 487.36 A: [noise] 

490.47 491.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

492.31 495.47 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] well are you talking about a parent 

495.03 498.66 B: yeah yeah my dad passed away um three years ago 

495.72 496.97 A: [noise] 

497.48 499.99 A: [noise] [noise] so he must have been young 

500.19 502.88 B: (( he was fifty )) 

504.01 505.22 B: fifty five 

504.69 509.71 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] that's very young [noise] was it heart or cancer [noise] [noise] 

505.94 507.58 B: yeah i think i think 

509.16 512.51 B: it was actually sleep apnea so it was it was in the heart 

512.61 519.75 A: oh well you don't you never expect somebody at that age to to to go [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

513.58 514.45 B: so 

516.22 518.52 B: [sigh] no um right 

518.76 521.55 B: and that's what i mean you know you you just don't know when 

521.62 526.59 B: but that would be another thing that i would change just just to have a strong relationship 

523.89 534.34 A: yeah but you know what [noise] you have to look back and say what was the quality of the relationship you had and that's really more important than the time because even though you didn't spend time i'm sure you were on the telephone you spoke to him 

528.45 529.31 B: right 

534.12 535.17 B: yeah 

534.42 538.55 A: [noise] [noise] and did he uh wh- [noise] did you have your children when he was alive 

538.67 540.83 B: [sigh] one one i did so 

540.02 549.48 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] so he did see the child [noise] [noise] okay well then you should be happy about that [noise] [noise] but it's really the quality now when 

541.94 544.26 B: yeah yeah that was that was nice 

545.06 546.29 B: yeah 

549.50 557.35 A: [noise] [mn] talking about that i can think back in my relationship with my mother and she was very angry she became a widow when she was forty 

557.28 569.32 A: and she didn't know what to do with it and i was a kid and i used to tell her go out [noise] you know [sigh] date have a good time i'm going to leave the house we're going to leave the house you're going to be alone i was a kid i was like fourteen 

568.92 570.01 B: yeah 

569.43 579.26 A: and everybody told her oh you can't go out i mean it's crazy you can't go out so there was a lot of anger there and i couldn't handle the anger but then she got cancer [noise] 

579.47 582.37 A: and she became a totally different person 

582.43 592.13 A: [noise] and if she had died with all that anger i would've felt guilty but i came to terms with it because we became very close in that six months that she was dying [noise] 

591.58 592.65 B: (( wow )) 

592.54 599.99 A: and so i have no guilt [noise] or no regrets about the relationship i i saw her every day because i wanted to s-
