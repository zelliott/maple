98.69 99.81 A: right 

99.16 108.96 B: 'cause i have a good marriage but i would not have had my kids young i would have gone on and got a you know degree in something maybe i don't know law or something 

108.82 110.70 A: yeah i have a good career 

111.07 117.50 A: regardless of school but i would have paid more attention to school and i i mean 

117.60 120.54 A: it's just it's not more of some i mean i would have 

120.64 123.37 A: only because i know it would have gotten me more 

122.79 125.48 B: you would have got further if you'd have gone to school fur-

167.87 180.06 A: and even though she's been married twice before she said you know she's the first two were just lessons in life and this is this is i mean she she said this is the first she feels like she's never been married before coming into this marriage 

179.80 185.16 B: [noise] if she could go back and change that's what she would do a away with her past of being married yeah
