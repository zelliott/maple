349.28 358.76 B: it didn't last long but at least i didn't have any kids so there's no real reason to change that 'cause then i wouldn't have met my second husband who i've been married to for twenty years now so 

350.04 351.48 A: (( [noise] [noise] ))

364.69 365.71 A: right 

369.34 375.71 A: [laughter] 'cause that's just what happens if you change one thing everything is going to switch up 

375.36 382.80 B: but there wasn't any real damage done i mean you know maybe little tiny bits of psychological damage or emotional damage but 

380.70 381.91 A: (( right [noise] )) 

382.21 383.71 A: (( right )) 

382.88 390.38 B: there wasn't any real damage done to my life by um going through that if anything i think i grew up a lot in those coupla years 

389.77 392.67 A: [noise] but like you said no major changes you want to 

392.29 396.69 B: no no major change i think the only kind of changes i would really want to do

403.96 407.51 B: waltz into i mean i still had to i still worked hard i still 

407.72 416.62 B: wanted to earn the money i was making but you know having your father be the president of a company i was doing pretty good made it a lot easier for me 

410.01 410.97 A: right 

413.30 414.90 A: [noise] 

415.16 418.01 A: that helps a whole lot right [laughter] [noise]

447.50 452.97 B: so i didn't even let my youngest get his licence until he was almost eighteen 

453.20 457.26 A: (( [noise] oh yeah you know he was going to be reckless uh-oh )) 

453.57 455.69 B: 'cause i knew he was going to be trouble 

457.19 467.11 B: and then he had he wrecked up one of my cars that i let him drive 'cause he was looking for a car and he wrecked another car so his insurance is like it was eight grand a year we got it down to a six grand a year

506.22 512.18 B: in january and i'm hoping it'll drop a little bit then but i don't think it's going to drop until he's like twenty five and it's just 

512.08 513.34 A: (( [noise] )) 

512.71 518.58 B: i don't know it should drop a little bit 'cause he's been sticking with the same company if he keeps his record clean but

518.63 522.15 B: it's like the things that i would want to change would be like 

519.27 520.01 A: (( [noise] )) 

522.19 523.25 A: (( [noise] )) 

522.59 533.99 B: the ways that we spoiled them a little we should have like now one of my kids is living with my mother he came out here to arizona and then went back to connecticut 'cause he didn't really like it here and he missed his friends and my mother took him in 

528.82 529.79 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

534.19 535.74 B: and he's been there 

534.26 535.84 A: (( mm )) 

535.96 546.64 B: not quite a year but i'm wondering if my mother's sorry she took him in [laughter] i don't think so 'cause he's a pretty good kid but he's they're just not that responsible yet or ambitious you know 

537.25 538.00 A: [noise] 

539.07 541.54 A: [laughter]

554.84 556.78 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] okay )) 

555.93 559.71 B: and he doesn't want to go to college which i don't blame him 'cause i didn't want to go but 

558.63 561.56 A: (( [noise] right )) 

560.31 567.69 B: but it's tough to get into a good job today unless you just kinda luck into one or if you learn a trade or you know they just like 

564.83 565.85 A: [noise] [noise] sort of 

567.98 570.35 A: so the kids just hanging out [noise] 

568.50 578.47 B: it's hard for them to support themselves right now and maybe you know my mother says i shouldn't have done this for him and i shouldn't have done that for him 'cause now he's kinda like you know 

571.18 572.32 A: (( [noise] [lipsmack] )) 

572.52 573.69 A: (( i )) 

578.85 581.43 A: suppose all that's really like water under the bridge 

581.44 582.82 A: water you know 

582.46 586.21 B: but those are the only things i'd want to change those little things you know like 

585.99 586.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

586.26 599.46 B: we always let him talk us into like helping him buy a computer or like video game and he'd pay most of it back but not all of it back and then we'd let it slide you know and all those little 

592.84 594.44 A: right [noise] [noise] 

596.04 597.25 A: mm
