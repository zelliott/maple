0.00 1.04 A: (( hello )) 

0.64 1.86 B: hello 

1.51 2.63 A: hi there 

2.37 3.31 B: hi 

2.91 4.30 A: hi this is jim 

4.16 5.40 B: this is boon 

5.36 6.64 A: excuse me boon 

6.30 7.78 B: boon yes 

7.19 9.06 A: oh hi boon are you doin' 

8.73 10.46 B: i'm doin' pretty well how are you 

10.10 13.55 A: oh i can't complain having a decent day [laughter] 

12.58 15.73 B: indeed yeah where you where you uh calling from 

15.17 17.02 A: uh brooklyn new york 

16.41 19.49 B: br- oh i see i see i'm in harlem [mn] 

18.92 20.17 A: oh okay 

20.02 21.02 B: yes 

20.40 24.79 A: um boy what a topic to think right off the top of your head about 

23.00 30.51 B: [laughter] indeed well i mean i think we've all kind of thought about that at one point and another but yeah yeah pretty deep 

28.78 32.07 A: yeah do you have anything that you thought of right away 

32.30 42.05 B: um well the first thing i thought of i mean besides maybe you know romantic sort of things [laughter] uh uh my big one i guess is that i think back to uh i 

37.30 38.31 A: (( uh-huh )) 

42.27 45.25 B: think back to like high school and how uh 

46.00 51.39 B: how i didn't how i think uh i always had a good a good aptitude and i kind of let myself uh 

51.39 56.27 B: kind of uh eke by in high school and even a little bit in college and uh 

54.95 55.89 A: mhm 

56.04 58.35 B: i feel like if i had put my uh 

58.31 63.27 B: put my all into it you know given it you know a little more than that ten percent effort 

63.28 74.61 B: that i really could have uh i could have you know gone to a better college and then maybe would be in a better graduates program and things like that so i always wondered what would've happened if i could have if i had gone back and you know maybe taken out uh 

74.47 79.36 B: an hour of my time every day and actually studied instead of uh [laughter] you know 

77.64 88.34 A: ri- right i hear ya i know what that it's funny how uh things work out in life 'cause the first thing that came to my mind uh was the exact opposite of what you just said 

87.49 90.03 B: [laughter] really 

88.64 94.36 A: yeah i uh i ended up at hosta university here uh out on long island and uh 

94.20 105.49 A: i was just so focused that i mean i was always three chapters ahead in every class and i studied on the weekends and i think back to my my life there and thought 

105.35 119.48 A: if you coulda just taken it a little bit easier had more of a social life and and took in the the culture and and uh just the whole atmosphere the whole the whole experience rather than being um 

119.44 122.56 A: just so academic 'cause as it turns out 

122.41 135.95 A: um the first job i took was one with the government um and i really didn't need the high standards that i ended up with as far as grades at the end and uh looking back over that experience and everything that went on 

130.00 131.27 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

135.83 146.38 A: uh i missed a lot of opportunities to uh make more friends and join more clubs and things like that so it's it's just [laughter] funny how we were put together on this call 

145.55 151.95 B: [laughter] indeed it's it's always a hard thing to uh to uh postulate about because 

146.67 147.95 A: (( oh boy mhm mm )) 

151.91 153.05 B: uh you 

152.95 166.18 B: you never know i [laughter] see you you know regrets i've always thought was a ve- a very funny thing because you because you never really can know what would have happened you know and say that you had studied a little less i mean maybe the ramifications for that would have been greater than you 

160.69 161.73 A: (( mhm right )) 

166.00 173.67 B: than you think they might have been and maybe if i had studied more then it would have been it wouldn't have been so great the changes wouldn't have been so great either [noise] 

167.23 168.02 A: oh 

172.60 177.97 A: right right no you're you're absolutely right and i i'm a firm believer in uh 

177.79 180.68 A: you know how things go kind of 

180.48 193.83 A: even if you don't think they went right they the way what what makes up your life is all these experiences and sometimes something you don't think went right went exactly right 'cause you needed that experience to grow you later on in life 

193.60 194.59 B: absolutely 

193.67 203.07 A: and yeah yeah so how these things connect again we don't we don't have all the information we only have a uh a moment in time to figure that out 

202.75 203.73 B: mhm 

203.16 216.66 A: yeah no i agree with you and and you know what you know good study habits have also led to other things in life so you're right maybe those things needed to be there uh for other things for me um 

216.73 219.68 A: then again i i do see that uh 

219.81 221.83 A: socially i still don't 

221.78 236.36 A: i i don't act in circles and and i don't get out as much as i feel i should or i want to and um i wonder if um well maybe this call is is the wakeup call for me to to improve in that area i don't know 

233.09 237.26 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

236.63 238.94 A: but um yeah 

238.90 245.71 A: [lipsmack] but um see i also had uh something wh- that i didn't have control over when uh when i was seven years old i um 

245.57 252.41 A: i contracted uh rheumatoid arthritis and that changed the whole course of my life and uh 

252.27 267.12 A: i mean again you you don't know i 'cause all the experiences and going through [sigh] uh drugs and surgeries and what not all you know have made me who i am today and and you know adversity you know hopefully builds character um 

259.95 260.80 B: yes 

266.44 270.88 B: right i think the pr- i think the point goes even a little further that uh 

267.10 267.83 A: but 

269.54 270.44 A: mhm 

270.74 277.59 B: that when i if when i make a when i right now hypothesized about the kind of factuals that might have been the case 

277.22 278.00 A: mhm 

277.45 289.97 B: or what i might have liked to happen with my life what i'm what i'm saying is that if i had made a decision if i had made a change in the past if i had made a different decision i would be somewhere else right now that i would prefer however 

280.18 281.03 A: (( mhm mm mm )) 

289.73 301.41 B: as we said [laughter] what makes you who you are including your desires and the things that you like are the experiences you've had so if i had made a different decision at the time i would be a different person today and who's and so 

300.86 301.83 A: (( mhm yeah mhm )) 

301.21 309.64 B: i mean the idea of that i that i would prefer that life over this one doesn't even make sense because i wouldn't even exist in the same way i would be a different person so [mn] 

308.88 310.43 A: (( excellent yes mhm )) 

309.72 319.44 B: so i think that i i'm not even sure that it makes a lot of sense to regret things or to uh wish things had gone differently i don't i don't i don't think it's really that coherent of a of a notion [noise] 

318.81 326.11 A: right i agree with you i i think a better question would be if if my life had taken a different course uh 

325.99 332.74 A: especially um physically because i was very much into sport i'm kinda curious and i hope maybe uh 

332.51 345.26 A: some day if there's a a videotape in the next life to see what would have [laughter] what would have happened uh i wouldn't i'd be interesting to run that film and and just out of curiosity see what would have happened but you're right i mean 

337.23 339.02 B: [laughter] 

345.13 353.18 A: you're exactly right everything would have been different about who we are and where we're where we would have been and who's to say what that would have been all about 

352.59 353.75 B: exactly 

353.22 355.70 A: yeah yeah no i agree with that 

354.49 363.79 B: yeah yeah i feel like you know uh i mean things really would have been differently like that i remember when i applied for when i appl- was applying for colleges i was really into 

363.56 368.13 B: in high school into music and i was really into mathematics [laughter] and uh 

364.93 365.82 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

367.90 374.02 B: and so i i applied for like m._i._t. and some other like like uh programs 

373.40 374.25 A: (( mhm mm )) 

373.85 374.88 B: and uh 

374.81 379.19 B: and i didn't get into the ones that i really wanted but then i ended up going to school and i 

379.18 388.02 B: and the first classes i took were in philosophy and in russian [laughter] and i ended up going going on to major in a few different languages and in philosophy and now i'm in philosophy graduate school 

385.74 387.65 A: (( [mn] wow mm )) 

388.01 395.58 B: so i just wonder what really would have you know like everything would have been so different and if i if i had actually ended up taking the course that i 

393.57 394.39 A: (( yes )) 

395.44 408.42 B: that i originally intended on but apparently wasn't good enough for [laughter] so i'm actually happier like i i'm glad i'm not a mathematician i know a lot of mathematicians i like them but i wouldn't not want to be one of them so [laughter] 

396.71 397.65 A: oh 

398.92 400.35 A: (( right no [sigh] yeah uh-huh )) 

405.24 414.87 A: see that isn't that wow no that's that's good that you can see that that glimpse of it now that it you know going down that road really doesn't um [lipsmack] doesn't 

414.83 423.33 A: uh work as well as what you're in now that that's great 'cause uh i mean boy what a difference from math to philosophy that's that's [mn] 

418.42 419.17 B: yeah 

422.28 434.11 B: well um i'm i'm ve- i'm very mathematically minded in philosophy as much as that makes sense but very uh so i the my love for math is still there in that i like the idea of proof and i like the idea of uh 

432.62 433.95 A: uh-huh oh okay 

433.93 445.14 B: of uh very rigorous and logical explanations for things uh but i but yeah i but i think that in a way mathematicians think a lot less than philosophers do and they do and they're more into uh 

437.24 438.09 A: (( mm mm )) 

444.91 455.39 B: they're more into just learning formulas and then applying formulas whereas i'm i'm interested in taking formulas apart and seeing how they work and why they work and things like that [sigh] so um 

448.13 449.15 A: right 

452.30 465.61 A: right right yeah that's um yeah uh does does philosophy use a lot of um like the scientific method of of putting things down and seeing what worked what didn't work and why things like that okay 

464.75 465.90 B: [noise] um 

466.09 471.12 B: it it's more a a a related question that we would study in philosophy is 

471.03 484.63 B: is the scientific method a reliable method for uh for developing truth uh things like that so uh like the the question of hume had a fam- had a question uh that hume brought up you know two or three hundred years ago 

476.30 477.45 A: oh okay 

484.43 489.01 B: that we never really that scientific method can never really produce uh 

489.14 493.14 B: positive knowledge like it can never like certainty because we can 

493.11 505.38 B: the sun rises every day for instance it's risen every day of my life and every day of your life but nothing we can't we can't uh reason logically from that to a law of nature we can't reason from a finite number of cases of the sun rising 

496.59 497.69 A: (( mm right )) 

505.01 505.82 A: mhm 

505.19 515.44 B: to the general law that the sun rises every day and the prediction that the sun will rise tomorrow which is what we do in science so hume said that you know we can't do that and that's the kind of thing we talk about in philosophy you know 

510.86 511.73 A: mhm 

515.28 522.80 B: and we obviously do do that why do we do it so why does it work and uh and things like that so to me that's a lot more interesting so [noise] 

515.32 516.17 A: right 

518.87 519.65 A: (( mm )) 

520.17 521.19 A: wow 

521.62 529.37 A: yeah that is interesting the thing is though it sounds like that's on a road to uh never really having any definitive answers 

529.34 531.52 B: (( well um yeah [noise] )) 

529.36 540.19 A: right because if we're in a finite existence and making finite rules about what we know and we're only a blip on the screen then we never really can know everything 

540.01 547.21 B: no you're absolutely right and there are a lot lot of skeptics who say well for this very reason for hume's reason we can't know anything we just uh 

541.00 542.10 A: yeah 

546.42 547.64 A: (( mm that's just )) 

546.97 557.53 B: we go through our lives just uh we make these guesses about things but we really have no basis at all to predict what's going to happen in the future we have no reason to believe that the future will resemble the past [sigh] um 

555.99 565.42 A: right right wow wow oh boy that could real [laughter] you can go on and on with discussions on this stuff my goodness but but it sounds like you do enjoy it so 

559.40 563.62 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

565.07 568.10 B: i do so i mean as far as time travel like it's it's so 

565.49 566.67 A: yeah 

568.01 580.92 B: it's a scary thing i mean i think if anything i would like to time travel as as as you said in the future you'd like to see a tape of how things might have turned out i too would like to go back as a as kind of a independent observer you know who 

575.65 576.61 A: right 

580.10 581.59 A: mhm mhm 

580.70 587.75 B: not to relive my life but to kind of look at myself leading my life in the same or in different ways just from the outside knowing what i do now 

581.79 582.73 A: right 

587.36 588.35 A: right 

587.52 596.14 B: and uh things like that i think that would really that would be the interesting uh aspect of time travel to me if i could be independent of the way things are happening and just an observer 

594.88 599.95 A: right i yes i i that's exactly what i would like to do i and uh i don't know
