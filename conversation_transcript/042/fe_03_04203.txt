0.10 2.66 A: hi this is rina from iowa city 

2.23 5.52 B: hi uh this is meredith i'm actually also in iowa city 

5.19 8.45 A: (( are you really where in iowa city )) 

6.02 7.07 B: (( no kidding )) 

7.86 9.53 B: uh westside drive 

9.30 12.25 A: oh my god i'm actually in coralville right off the strip 

11.90 13.59 B: [laughter] awesome okay 

12.83 15.23 A: that's really odd [laughter] 

13.95 17.90 B: [laughter] yeah i think the last time i did one of these i talked to somebody out in california 

17.59 20.58 A: yeah i think that's i talked to somebody from like washington 

20.97 24.94 A: last night with a far more interesting topic actually 

24.42 26.94 B: so are you a linguistic student then or 

26.63 33.70 A: um no actually i f- i used to be [noise] a psych and social study social work student um but i'm no longer in school 

33.47 36.66 B: huh okay so how did you find out about the uh about the study 

35.62 41.06 A: about the study um actually i'm a participant in a whole bunch of different human services sites 

40.66 41.60 B: (( oh okay )) 

40.97 51.42 A: and so i get referrals to different studies that require human participants and they figure that social service or human rights people will probably be more likely to participate 

42.68 43.62 B: oh 

51.09 52.08 B: neat 

51.82 53.29 A: yeah how about you 

52.28 56.29 B: i'm just i'm a linguistic student so that was that was how i found out about this 

54.12 55.13 A: oh 

55.96 57.47 A: that's pretty cool 

57.92 59.62 A: so have you taken the calls before 

59.77 61.20 B: um sorry 

60.59 63.23 A: [noise] have you taken calls for them before 

62.81 64.20 B: uh just one 

63.94 66.10 A: yeah this is my second as well 

64.41 65.20 B: yeah 

66.26 67.57 A: so what do you think 

67.22 75.36 B: groovy about businesses um well let's see i think if i were gonna start a business um i would probably want to start like a magazine 

68.34 69.13 A: yeah 

75.49 76.48 A: really 

76.07 77.03 B: yeah 

76.98 78.19 A: of what nature 

77.97 79.10 B: uh fiction 

79.04 80.14 A: (( okay [mn] )) 

79.74 85.94 B: yeah 'cause i i r- i write you know just some fi- a a little bit of stuff like science fiction and fantasy and stuff like that 

85.50 88.28 A: actually my partner does sci fi fantasy writing 

87.84 89.04 B: oh really 

88.41 90.77 A: yeah he's working on his second book right now 

90.42 92.60 B: awesome has he had anything published 

91.17 93.97 A: and i'm actually reading his favorite series right now 

92.91 95.99 B: (( yet has he had anything published yet )) 

94.87 99.35 A: no um he just bought his very first book on self publishing so [noise] we'll see 

98.98 104.94 B: it's it's difficult it is but i mean i've i've had like a couple of short stories published but nothing huge 

100.12 101.08 A: is it 

104.92 108.44 A: he's been fearfully living in iowa city but not being brave enough to 

108.55 111.31 A: try to join the writers' workshop for a long time [sigh] 

110.75 119.80 B: i've heard that they're that they're very um that that there's a lot of antipathy towards um anything even remotely like fantasy like 

119.22 120.62 A: (( really )) 

120.27 130.61 B: yeah 'cause i took one of their undergrad classes and um one of the other students said that her mom um had taken [sigh] like one of the upper level undergrad classes 

122.37 123.32 A: okay 

129.98 130.85 A: okay 

130.71 135.91 B: and that she was thinking about the mom was thinking about applying to the graduate program 

135.44 136.27 A: okay 

135.98 141.25 B: and the instructor for the class um looked at this one story that she had written 

140.88 142.10 A: mhm 

141.42 155.47 B: um that had a scene in it where a character has a dream about having a conversation with one of their dead relatives and the instructor said you know this is a real good story but you're gonna have to change this one scene because they're gonna think that it's too 

148.24 149.74 A: (( okay [noise] )) 

155.42 157.95 B: you know too out there too fantastical 

157.94 163.38 A: you know i think it's really rare to find adults that are brave [noise] enough to use their imaginations these days though 

163.56 169.52 A: you would think that that would be embraced but it seems anything about spirituality anything about 

165.17 166.73 B: yeah um 

169.60 175.79 A: i don't anything that involves adults you know conceiving of anything other than what we see seems to be 

175.53 181.01 B: yeah and it's it's weird too because i mean it's not that out there to have dreams about your dead relatives 

180.53 182.02 A: no kidding there 

182.51 184.65 A: are people that are completely rational that 

184.70 189.77 A: really honestly believe that they talk to their dead relatives on a regular basis in dreams so 

189.46 197.56 B: yeah and i mean there's a lot of there's a lot of science fiction and fantasy that's really you know that's really literary in nature and that's the kind of magazine i'd like to start 

189.90 191.62 A: so much for that 

197.55 199.28 A: that would be terrific 

199.09 200.48 B: so what kind of what kind of bus- 

199.70 207.43 A: and i would pick it up [laughter] actually the only time i've ever thought about starting my own business was when i when i visited israel a couple of years ago 

200.80 202.49 B: [laughter] cool cool 

207.05 207.84 B: uh-huh 

207.64 213.92 A: um and when i visited i realized that this is a country that was perpetually in a state of war so that all 

214.29 219.16 A: pretty much all funds that were available were always going towards military 

219.83 221.89 A: you know businesses or 

222.05 227.01 A: military suppliers or the military itself and that very little was going towards social services 

226.59 227.43 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

227.08 234.65 A: so very little money i i work with um women and children primarily usually survivors of domestic violence or sexual abuse 

231.07 231.86 B: uh-huh 

234.32 235.11 B: uh-huh 

234.86 246.66 A: so i realized that very little money was going into services for women plus there was this whole division between jewish israeli and palestinian israeli women and so there was certainly no cross cultural services 

246.27 248.05 B: (( [noise] right )) 

246.74 255.62 A: so it was even harder to seek you know any kind of care because services would be specified [noise] for either you know jewish israeli or palestinian israeli so 

255.30 256.96 B: right 

255.63 263.34 A: i always thought that if i had the money that i would try to set up some kind of cross cultural social services for women in the middle east 

262.93 266.92 B: that's a neat idea 'cause that would be an that would be an interesting way of fostering understanding 

266.67 268.19 A: i would hope so 

268.40 277.78 A: i mean i would think that you know that there's gotta be a huge you know percentage of the population that just needs to live their life despite the fact that all of these things are going on and 

276.95 284.14 B: [noise] [noise] well right and if you get people in group interaction you know they realize that there are certain problems that occur you know i- for every 

283.31 285.51 A: cross cultural yeah 

284.18 285.85 B: for for every culture 

285.85 288.53 A: i don't know how i'd go about it i would imagine 

289.02 290.69 A: i mean it would have to be 

291.77 294.11 A: it w- it would have to be non for profit 

293.51 295.40 B: yeah oh sure yeah absolutely 

294.95 298.97 A: because these people are constantly rebuilding their lives and 

297.46 298.50 B: yeah 

299.03 304.28 A: women aren't allotted funds anyway it's it's a pretty patriarchal society from what i could tell 

304.09 305.86 B: right 

304.41 310.39 A: and so men really have control over a lot of the money and a lot of the services would probably be considered pretty liberal 

310.57 313.57 A: so they wouldn't really be supported by 

313.38 317.05 B: so you'd be overcoming a lotta pressure just as both as a woman and as an american 

315.06 316.07 A: yeah 

316.96 325.81 A: i don't know how i'd be as business owner though i'm not really business oriented i'm social service oriented i might have to hire someone out to do that end of things 

325.77 337.16 B: well i think it still counts as a business even if it is a not for profit 'cause you know y- 'cause even non for profits have to you know have to sorta keep a business plan and you know manage a budget and stuff like that 

333.79 335.63 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

336.15 343.66 A: well i've done a little bit of grant writing thus far and that's a big pain in the ass so [laughter] i don't think that i'd like that either [laughter] but 

338.99 339.83 B: cool 

342.98 347.21 B: i i applied for a for a grant this last year but i didn't get it so 

345.67 346.61 A: did you 

347.17 354.17 A: [sigh] it's awful i don't think i don't know living under this administration you're gonna get money for anything cool 

354.14 360.48 B: well this was from the national science foundation um yeah um i'm going into computer science next year 

356.59 357.63 A: really 

360.26 361.14 A: okay 

360.50 367.71 B: so i applied for just a computational linguistics project essentially 'cause they offer all these things to uh 

364.17 365.04 A: (( i see )) 

367.78 370.47 B: they o- they offer all these grants to um 

370.90 373.52 B: first and second year graduate students essentially 

372.44 374.84 A: [noise] i see are you a grad student then 

374.57 377.37 B: yeah yeah [noise] i'm getting my masters on friday 

375.01 375.78 A: okay 

376.97 380.04 A: i see oh my gosh congratulations 

379.37 380.79 B: thank you [laughter] [noise] 

380.51 384.26 A: i forget that people are in school and that these are graduation dates 

383.72 385.56 B: [laughter] 

384.54 387.63 A: are you in the midst of finals or do you have finals [noise] 

386.99 392.01 B: um i've got a i've g- i've actually got a final at like seven thirty tomorrow morning [laughter] in 

390.99 394.58 A: (( oh my gosh lots of luck meredith )) 

392.25 393.72 B: yeah it's pr- it's 

394.25 402.33 B: thank you it's actually for an undergrad class you know so it doesn't really count towards my you g- it's 'cause i'm changing fields i had to take some computer science classes [sigh] 

394.92 396.28 A: you're welcome 

401.35 402.26 A: right 

402.44 409.54 A: so usually enough actually tony [laughter] he minored in c._s. he majored in religion and german and he writes science fiction 

409.37 410.41 B: wow

457.81 468.01 A: he's actually they've [laughter] they have no outlet right now other than their own writing and and each other alan and tony so we've been developing some live action role playings as an outlet 

457.84 458.80 B: well 

467.49 469.72 B: oh cool i used to do that a lot 

469.12 472.88 A: i used to do that in high school and i haven't done it since so this is kind of interesting 

472.44 474.83 B: (( i i did it when i was an undergrad in huston so )) 

474.62 480.76 A: yes so they've started um a role playing campaign based on robert jordan's work 

480.46 481.27 B: okay 

480.90 482.16 A: have you read his work 

482.22 485.69 B: some um i'm more of a tolkien fan um

489.09 489.92 A: yeah 

492.20 493.21 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

495.34 499.96 B: one of jordan's novels and i read it and i was like man this is really ripping off tolkien hard core 

499.17 507.91 A: [laughter] yeah i think there's a lot of borrowing and then you read p. s. anthony and you realize that he's ripping off people too there's a lot that's ripped off from asimov as well 

500.00 500.93 B: [laughter] 

505.32 506.79 B: yeah 

507.77 512.00 B: yeah but there are a lot of newer writers these days that are very originally china 

512.08 513.67 A: mhm mhm 

513.02 515.40 B: he's really impressive um 

514.81 520.06 A: [noise] i really i admire the way that jordan handled his female characters that was great 

519.70 525.21 B: yeah those were a lot they were a lot more modern i think than uh than a lot of uh do you read any neil gaiman 

522.69 523.61 A: yeah 

525.27 526.33 A: excuse me 

525.85 527.28 B: do you read any neil gaiman 

527.16 533.00 A: no but he's been recommended to me before as a matter of fact i have been trying to remember that name for a really long time 

529.50 530.68 B: fantastic 

532.47 535.17 B: stuff well there you go [laughter] 

533.47 535.34 A: [laughter] how do you spell the last name

537.18 538.22 A: okay 

538.28 542.44 A: yeah my friend nicholas actually asked me to go ahead and read that and then i forgot the name 

542.97 545.10 B: (( i've got a number of his novels actually so yeah for )) 

545.11 546.31 A: really 

546.50 551.35 A: i think i'm i'm on book eight of ten for of robert jordan's work 

550.51 552.54 B: (( real time okay that's that )) 

551.66 555.96 A: um so as soon as i finish that i think i'm gonna read conversations with god 

556.16 559.21 A: because that that was also recommended towards to me 

558.01 561.32 B: is that robert sawyer or no that's calculating god 

560.99 563.41 A: i i'm not sure who the author is 

563.49 576.91 A: um a friend of mind um knew that i was kind of on a hunt for my own kind of higher power and kind of metaphysical view of the world and he said that this would be a book that i really enjoy or a series that i'd really enjoy so there are three of them i 

577.04 579.85 A: guess one's written kind of written on an individual 

579.91 586.01 A: level hypothetical conversations with a higher power the second is local and the third is global so 

585.24 586.13 B: (( mhm cool okay )) 

586.78 588.35 A: i'm excited about that 

587.51 589.79 B: the the the title doesn't ring a bell but 

589.89 592.70 A: i know evidently it's been really popular lately 

592.35 593.17 B: cool
