127.63 142.13 A: see um and today's ah you know world is not comparable to yesterday's world i would have um you know wished to have accomplished my education a bit earlier than now

164.27 165.28 B: uh-huh 

165.10 166.38 A: um 

166.40 170.29 A: there are so many things that i would have accomplished you know that i would 

170.68 175.05 A: want to have accomplished in time in those days ah if i had a change 

175.81 177.55 A: (( but as you see )) 

177.60 180.90 A: wishing is is is not doing 

181.01 182.16 A: um

190.84 202.02 A: (( um i did not have a good education background i grew up in a country where apartheid was ah the norm of the day )) 

194.16 195.16 B: right 

202.32 209.47 A: and that has sort of ah prevented me to do things that i would have liked to do 

209.63 215.80 A: ah one definitely is i would have ventured vigorously in education 

215.81 218.96 A: to not only educate myself 

219.34 223.51 A: but then to be able to assist other people 

223.58 233.61 A: by assisting other people i mean there are other many people around the world or live in my country who are unable 

233.74 245.16 A: to access education because of the vastness of the country because of the poverty and because of the exposure to those harshness during colonialism but now 

245.20 248.18 A: that i'm at this age i don't really regret 

248.76 258.44 A: (( i don't regret however i wish i could have had a change to accomplish a bit ah of education a bit earlier other than now )) 

258.75 261.12 B: and what country did you grow up in

271.06 273.97 A: (( country where apartheid was practised )) 

274.23 275.19 B: oh 

275.01 280.24 A: yes we were a colony of south south ah it's the bad south african regime 

280.81 287.35 A: before that we were a colony of germany and we had been subjected to all sort of um 

287.37 288.55 A: um 

289.37 303.21 A: exclusion in decision making ah we were excluded in education we were excluded in almost in everything so one would have wished to accomplish a lot of things if you had ah if one had a chance to do so 

304.41 306.39 A: ah i have now 

306.54 311.95 A: (( a chance presently but that's now ah in my early you know years )) 

311.80 325.25 A: so um i i i mean ah i- i- i- if one wished you know you would not want to wait until you are very old or you're old you would want to finish your schooling i mean your school career while you are very very young 

325.00 326.18 B: right 

325.96 329.21 A: so ah that's something that i would have wished

347.49 348.39 A: yes 

348.45 355.61 A: (( did you actu- did did you have problem to access education or to to finish one i mean your career that you wanted to have )) 

356.36 361.50 B: um i i chose to take a job um [lipsmack] 

361.82 368.57 B: i chose to take a job at twenty years old and not go to school so it was my choice not to go to school 

367.22 367.97 A: (( mm )) 

368.79 370.04 A: (( okay [cough] )) 

368.99 374.71 B: looking back i wish i would have chosen school over a corporate job 

374.67 379.29 A: oh yes yes yes it's always regrettable sometimes 

378.95 380.11 B: mhm 

379.49 386.17 A: (( but ah when you make decisions sometimes you think it's the right choice to make )) 

386.49 389.46 A: (( you make a decision you think it's the right decision )) 

389.52 397.88 A: you wanna regret when you you come to terms of understanding that ahah this is not what i'm supposed to have done 

397.81 399.02 B: right 

398.23 399.59 A: i've messed up 

399.60 400.63 B: right 

400.10 401.82 A: (( but um [mn] )) 

402.12 406.61 A: there is always a a a way out sometimes ah 

407.08 420.52 A: when you really realise something is going wrong unless if you realise very very late but if you realise in a a a a reasonable time you would always be in a position sort of you want i mean you can change you can 

420.35 427.80 A: you can you can page out pull the page out you know and get to something that you really or closer to something that you really want to do 

423.04 423.95 B: right 

427.83 428.70 B: right 

428.95 429.96 A: (( and )) 

429.16 434.92 B: i i agree with that i think um circumstances change as you get older 

435.32 436.95 B: with family 

436.81 437.87 A: right 

437.21 442.03 B: um and financial and the the time it would take 

442.22 445.72 B: [lipsmack] to get the education you have to give up a lot as well 

445.64 446.53 A: yes 

445.78 449.48 B: and i think that makes it very difficult to give up 

449.46 450.79 A: exactly 

450.36 451.77 B: um a lot of things 

450.93 451.95 A: so 

452.30 456.73 A: if that's the situation ah because wishing is wishing we wish 

456.66 468.28 A: we would have done this but if ah it it's not always possible as you are saying but there is something that's closer that's probably closer to that one you wanted to do probably that you can venture into 

468.15 475.51 A: (( but we have got now young people whom we are either taking care of as ah our own children )) 

475.58 481.17 A: (( or as ah siblings siblings or um as ah as extended family members )) 

481.15 490.10 A: w- w- what do you think what advice do you have ah so that we can ah i mean you can probably um guide them 

489.96 496.17 A: in or ah right it in the right time before they come they they they and 

496.00 501.64 B: well i know that my son i have i'm a single parent of a sixteen year old 

501.52 502.61 A: right 

502.01 505.98 B: and i encourage him to get a good education because 

506.38 511.02 B: of what's of the jobs that are out there today are not easy to find 

511.39 518.05 B: and i think what our economy is going through today is really no different than we did in the nineteen thirties 

511.53 512.09 A: (( [mn] )) 

517.98 526.89 A: correct yes so the trend of the economy is is is is it is a problem in in in ah in a way to good education 

519.05 520.09 B: and 

526.66 527.71 B: right 

528.61 536.45 B: i try to encourage him to get even a trade to fall back on something that he can always find employment 

536.52 537.66 A: right 

537.01 543.04 B: um it's really what i'm encouraging him today he's in high school but not getting the [noise] 

540.73 541.66 A: yes 

543.12 545.51 B: not getting very good grades 

545.70 547.49 A: that's right mm 

545.79 546.91 B: and 

547.29 554.43 B: yeah i just wanna encourage him all i can it's kind of hard because they know everything at sixteen [laughter] 

554.39 568.05 A: yes i i i i get your point i get your point very well ah the thing is also whether we grew up in a in a in a neighborhood in a community where education is highly regarded or where education is 

556.16 556.83 B: yes 

568.52 570.86 A: (( accessibly possible )) 

570.67 585.09 A: (( ah in general in terms of ah the you know ah financial accessibility and then ah in terms of ah ah material ap- ah i mean ah accessible so yeah ah how do you think the environment where you stay )) 

585.03 586.63 A: and where the child stays 

587.76 589.62 B: and where he stays 

589.23 591.19 A: (( yeah in terms of education )) 

592.47 599.89 A: (( i in a in the area where he can access education easily you've got all the accessibilities to go the ))
