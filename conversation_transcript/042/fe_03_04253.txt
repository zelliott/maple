47.01 48.69 A: [sigh] that was um 

49.03 59.03 A: away from my neighborhood [sigh] um i went and did that and i think i would not do that again i think i would stay in my neighborhood school because

62.86 63.80 B: right 

67.24 77.50 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] reunions and stuff [sigh] u._m. wh- where i went to school uh people came from like all over the place so that when once you left school there was [laughter] 

68.76 69.77 B: right 

74.78 75.86 B: right 

77.70 91.43 A: you know everybody got either got well we didn't have school buses in those days but [sigh] everybody got on a trolley or a train or a bus and went home [sigh] s- and there there was nobody in my neighborhood that went to that school so 

85.79 86.72 B: right 

90.37 101.04 B: right i guess it's kinds like college where you know if you go to high school together you stay friends but college it's kind of people come from all over and you kind of lose lose touch and things like that 

95.63 96.75 A: yeah 

99.09 109.75 A: yeah so that i don't i think that was the probably something i you know it looked a the time like it would have it was a good move but [sigh] um and one of [mn] 

109.66 118.98 A: uh one of the people that i that i knew that went that did that um they didn't seem to have a problem you know with it that [sigh] no but i 

115.71 116.84 B: [noise] really 

119.30 123.14 A: i ne- i i guess i needed my friends more than 

122.79 134.08 B: yeah i d- it does make a difference i think where you go to school i had a friend who [sigh] went to uh elementary and junior high with everybody else from where she lived but then she went to a private school 

133.76 134.75 A: mhm 

134.14 137.37 B: for high school and we all you know lost touch with her 

134.96 136.11 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

137.27 141.39 A: that's exactly what i did yeah and it was really hard [sigh] yeah 

137.40 137.98 B: (( [noise] )) 

138.47 139.54 B: right 

140.11 147.12 B: yeah and it was weird because the school was i mean it was [mn] basically right near our district but it was a totally different world 

146.54 147.90 A: oh yeah 

147.31 150.22 B: as far as i mean it was it's called the george school 

150.10 152.10 A: [sigh] oh yeah mhm 

150.94 164.60 B: and uh you know like bill cosby's son went there and and all that and uh and it was right i mean we went to the school district right next door to where her private school was [sigh] but she just you know we just all lost touch with her and [sigh] you know you know 

159.63 160.77 A: [sigh] right 

164.01 170.52 A: that's exactly what happens yeah yeah what would you change is there something specific or 

165.51 167.85 B: yeah so [sigh] 

169.82 179.43 B: um i don't know about anything specific i think um not so much something that i did but maybe things i didn't do as far as [sigh] you know tell people i liked them or 

179.85 185.81 B: [lipsmack] um you know just be bolder in certain things like i think anything i've i've been a teacher since then 

185.62 200.17 B: [sigh] and i look at some of the stuff the kids do or don't do and i'm just like you're so stupid you know like just you know say what you want to say and dress how you want to dress and [sigh] and don't do things to impress other people and care so much like i would definitely not care so much [sigh] 

199.82 202.47 A: [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

200.03 213.18 B: what people thought of me you know i mean every kid every did they they have a pimple they think oh my god everybody's looking at me and you grow up and you realize that [mn] they all have pimples [sigh] you know what i mean [sigh] and it's it's not that big a deal and i would probably feel more secure about myself you know back then 

207.79 208.99 A: (( yeah but )) 

212.13 214.18 A: i think that comes with age 

213.88 215.85 B: yeah i think yeah 

214.61 215.91 A: i really do 

215.87 216.81 B: (( 'cause you )) 

215.96 228.21 A: i think the older you [laughter] get the less you worry about well i with me it's been that way and with some of my friends i mean [sigh] the less it becomes important but in oh gosh in school it seems very important [sigh] 

218.98 220.08 B: yeah 

227.41 233.93 B: right that's it it's like so traumatic if you don't have the same clothes that everybody else has and [sigh] um [lipsmack] 

234.07 247.71 B: and i have kids now and like my son's two and i just feel like y- you know i hope he's always his own person like he's really strange right now and [sigh] makes well he makes us laugh and everything and i want it always i you know i want him to always just be [sigh] 

241.09 243.62 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

247.59 260.14 B: himself and not you know turn that off or not be like oh the other kids think i'm weird so i can't be like that any more or you know i just a [sigh] and it's just it's hard 'cause you know you hear it when you're a kid you hear you know oh this you know 

256.09 257.00 A: yeah 

259.91 273.33 B: things'll change or you'll feel differently when you're older or it won't matter as much or you'll forget about this and w- at the time you think you know everything you're like no i won't it's the most important thing and if i can't have what the other kids have or [sigh] you know be like the other kids so 

264.57 265.72 A: yeah 

271.07 272.09 A: yeah 

273.19 277.73 A: [sigh] i think it is though i really do i think uh the issue um [sigh] 

278.91 285.71 A: it i think there's something about not being part of the group when you're young the m- that really 

285.48 286.93 B: scars you [laughter] 

285.99 288.41 A: stay [laughter] stays with you 

287.80 289.34 B: yeah yeah 

288.58 299.28 A: i do i mean i w- i was part of the group until [laughter] i hit high school [sigh] and i i don't think it affected me as much in high school as it would have in elementary school but um 

292.26 293.28 B: right 

298.03 299.13 B: yeah 

299.95 303.70 A: it's i think it i think it it is 

303.70 317.76 A: for whate- i don't know what it is [laughter] if it goes back to the old primitive times like the [sigh] a group is is safer than an individual [sigh] but w- why we need to do that or what uh fortunately where my 

310.26 312.61 B: yeah more secure yeah 

317.57 319.68 A: grandchild i have grandchildren 

320.24 326.20 A: [lipsmack] and [sigh] fortunately where my grandchildren go to school they finally put in a dress code [sigh] but 

324.98 328.40 B: yeah i would love that even as a teacher [mn] as 

327.42 331.57 A: 'cause that has got that has gotten so ridiculous with the clothing 

329.94 340.55 B: yeah that's wonderful that they did that i know in you know the the school district i grew up in um [sigh] was pretty i mean the high the teachers are the highest paid in the state so you know the parents have a a good deal of money [sigh] 

339.93 340.91 A: mhm 

340.31 347.81 B: in the district and they fight every time somebody brings up you know lets get a dress code the parents fight it and i want my kids to be unique and and that's because 

347.09 347.91 A: right 

347.69 358.89 B: they all want to you know like they're they're all into trying to out out impress each other you know they all have the bigger house and the bigger car and [sigh] and they want their kids to look more affluent whereas i'm just like 

348.57 349.51 A: [laughter] 

350.92 352.82 A: do the [mn] [laughter] 

354.56 355.52 A: right 

358.50 359.46 A: right 

358.89 369.25 B: y. y you know no don't put 'em all right make their personalities make them stand out [sigh] their intelligence you know make them stand out in other ways you know in with their skills and their abilities [sigh] 

362.94 364.00 A: sure 

368.64 383.20 A: yeah that it really doesn't stifle people i [mn] [laughter] i grew up in a really heavily catholic neighborhood and i'm not catholic but a lot of my friends went to parochial school and [sigh] it believe me it does not stifle individuality or 

378.16 380.02 B: mhm the uniform [laughter] 

381.78 383.90 B: no it doesn't [mn] no 

383.10 386.34 A: it cr- it actually makes them more creative [laughter] 

385.58 398.70 B: right that's it it uh brings out your personality it brings out your creative side [sigh] and i i've said to my husband and just from a teacher i'm like i wish they would uh you know put in a dress code even for the teachers [laughter] be like [laughter] where you know what i mean i'm just like 'cause 

389.58 390.51 A: yeah 

397.31 401.07 A: see if if you wouldn't have to decide what to wear [laughter] every day [laughter] [mn] 

398.87 410.24 B: yeah you wouldn't have to decide what to wear and suffer for the kids it would just be like you know nobody has to know who's r- richer than whom and [sigh] you know what i mean who has a better sense of st- you know what i mean like the stuff that doesn't really matter 

408.09 409.14 A: yeah 

409.78 413.02 A: [sigh] yeah that takes one of our differences away 

410.45 411.41 B: and um 

412.43 425.35 B: yeah i wish all schools would do that i just think that would be [sigh] you know for the benefit i have a neighbor who's [sigh] always trying to [sigh] she [mn] they have no money they live on credit they're in their forties they're you know they they 

425.35 430.52 B: they have nothing saved they sold their house and they spent all the money and they rent the house they're in now [sigh] 

429.97 430.90 A: mhm 

430.42 436.54 B: and she still buys her daughter on credit she buys her daughter like three hundred dollar bracelets 'cause all her friends have bracelets and she's alw- 

435.78 437.06 A: oh my god 

436.50 449.81 B: [sigh] she's always saying how badly she feels for her daugh- oh i feel so bad that we have to h- live in this small house when all christine's friends have [sigh] big houses and their parents all drive b._m._w.s and i'm driving [sigh] you know a toyota and [mn] and it's just like 

443.71 444.65 A: yeah 

449.67 457.52 B: well you know as a mother that shouldn't matter like you shouldn't be telling you kid you know you should be especially if you don't have money you shouldn't be telling your kids that's what matters is money [sigh]
