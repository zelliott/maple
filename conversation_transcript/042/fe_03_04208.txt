353.50 367.14 A: yeah but now we can't tolerate i'm joking no no w- we a lot of our problem comes with we live with our with his parents and that's another big thing i'd have changed i'd have made him get us an at least an apartment the day i moved in [sigh] [mn] 

356.55 358.41 B: i i know what you mean uh-huh 

360.84 361.82 B: (( ugh ))

374.21 379.11 B: [sigh] oh that's great well co- oh that's wonderful i'm so glad for ya 

377.99 381.59 A: [cough] the only downside is his father's the primary on the [laughter] loan 

381.39 384.24 B: well that's all right just 

382.32 386.29 A: well uh it's because he made the mistake of lending his credit to his sister 

385.83 387.38 B: yeah oh yeah we 

386.62 396.34 A: and i wouldn't have let him do that either now that i'm thinking about it oh and she went three months delinquent on her car but they put him down as the primary on the loan so it affected his credit 

389.17 390.51 B: yeah we 

391.89 393.42 B: well my [mn] 

395.51 401.29 B: exactly my husband did that for his brother and he run up ten thousand dollars and we ended up had to go bankrupt 

400.88 401.92 A: mm 

401.30 411.17 B: because we couldn't pay his bills and ours too you know yeah that that that would be something you'd wanna change yeah if you could go ba- oh gosh but they say hindsight's twenty twenty 

403.24 404.48 A: (( right )) 

407.31 408.62 A: (( yeah )) 

410.49 411.82 A: (( right oh )) 

411.12 417.02 B: and [laughter] we can't go back and change it but oh i i fully understand that 

416.32 421.33 A: and we have three [mn] and so technically on his credit we have three vehicles now 

420.89 421.92 B: uh-huh 

421.50 426.40 A: we have his truck which is a two thousand and one and we still owe like sixteen grand on 

425.57 427.28 B: (( uh mm mm exactly )) 

426.55 432.89 A: her car which we still owe fifteen grand one and my van which we still owe thirteen on 

428.88 430.69 B: oh gee 

432.29 433.92 B: oh that's a bummer 

433.38 438.49 A: yeah so we have to put his father down as the primary owner occupant [sigh] 

437.04 450.49 B: yeah because you're over extended yeah huh i kn- been there been there done that [lipsmack] well thank goodness that my husband and i came into our marriage without any debts except for we bought this place and his his ex wife he'd only been marred to 

438.91 439.91 A: yeah 

444.47 445.06 A: (( mm ))

461.41 463.99 A: oh wow [noise] 

466.58 467.97 A: oh wow 

467.45 480.88 B: and and i really wouldn't change anything with he and i had a rough time i didn't know if i was ready to get married again and i broke up with him and dated a lot of other guys off the internet it was a lot of fun you know at sixty and uh 

478.60 479.67 A: right 

480.55 482.49 A: being allowed to date again 

481.92 491.90 B: oh yeah it was fun you know 'cause i got married so young and uh didn't date a lot and so it was i had a lotta fun met a lotta nice but i dated eighteen guys in eighteen months

495.34 496.33 B: mhm 

497.61 499.49 B: i'm thinking that too but 

499.54 503.85 A: i mean how since i've been with my husband since i was fourteen you know 

502.05 503.23 B: fourteen 

503.25 510.23 B: [mn] right and i i i know where you're coming from i do and the only thing is that if you get to that point you feel like that 

509.15 513.87 A: and especially now we fight so much but because of his being with his family 

510.71 516.50 B: th- mhm uh r- oh g- i sure couldn't live my husband's family 

515.65 521.05 A: and and granted we've moved into the garage but [mn] it's still in the same house you know 

519.97 524.07 B: yeah and they still know when you're coming in when you're going and what you're doing uh-huh

551.11 552.15 B: mhm 

552.11 559.80 B: so that's one of the things you would like to change uh the fact that when you got married if you could've been living on your own instead of having to live with his parents 

554.42 555.76 A: yeah 

558.01 561.35 A: [sigh] definitely definitely [noise]
