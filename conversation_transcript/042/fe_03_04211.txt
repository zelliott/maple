7.83 12.57 A: sure this is if you go back in time is there something that you would like to change 

11.78 12.86 B: right 

12.99 17.63 A: [lipsmack] my first [noise] uh thing that i would like to change would be on nine eleven 

18.13 22.76 A: that i could change something that day that would've stopped what happened [noise]

34.37 36.90 B: [lipsmack] if i could go back in time um 

37.03 40.12 B: it's just really it's really hard to say if if we're talking about 

40.62 44.73 B: event or talking about something in our personal life 

45.25 54.45 B: um [mn] uh then i would have many thing that i think if i could rethink on knowing what i know now i would do differently um 

53.14 54.17 A: mhm 

55.70 60.67 B: but then they of course would affect the outcome of everything else that's happened in my life so 

61.55 68.41 B: honestly i think i would have to say no i would not change anything of it because all of it did have a ripple effect 

68.30 70.04 A: and that's in your personal life 

69.36 71.60 B: yes in my personal life 

71.13 72.34 A: mhm 

71.67 77.60 B: i b- and i believe that was you know what they were referring to and uh so i don't think i would change any of it 

78.42 83.12 A: so if you had if you had the chance to is there anything that you would change 

82.37 83.05 B: no 

83.92 85.84 A: i mean not in your personal life

94.74 95.80 B: no 

94.76 96.87 A: or if you had the opportunity 

96.35 106.32 B: no i think i've pretty well done just about everything i've ever wanted to do or decided to do and haven't really l- left any uh stones unturned that i 

107.28 111.46 B: didn't do or d- or any regrets things that i didn't um 

111.52 114.53 B: that i didn't decided i didn't want to 

114.98 117.31 B: so no i can't really say 

115.93 120.51 A: well what about what about traveling is there anywhere that you would've liked to have traveled to [noise] 

118.43 119.23 B: no 

119.67 124.67 B: [lipsmack] no really i i think when i was younger i traveled uh to just about every place that i 

124.71 130.84 B: decided to go when i wanted to go now that i'm you know older i really don't even 

131.42 135.54 B: care about going anywhere um it's such a hassle to 

135.81 137.39 B: (( try to um well )) 

137.47 140.02 B: try to well flying is just not 

140.21 142.28 B: huh what it used to be huh 

141.23 144.07 A: no it's more of a nightmare now [laughter] 

143.23 147.89 B: uh really and it's just so much aggravation um that it's 

144.11 145.49 A: mhm 

147.93 151.14 B: really not worth the whole hassle of it 

150.81 151.82 A: mhm 

151.17 165.53 B: uh i had thought about i i'd gone on a short cruise um and i thought about going on a lengthier cruise later on in my life and t- now reading the things and reading about these 

165.40 173.44 B: cruise ships and the waters and the the the diseases um i just say nope that's not for me 

165.48 168.22 A: these cruises and mhm 

173.83 176.48 B: of course since i'm not a person who 

176.60 178.67 B: travels light um 

178.80 180.30 B: [lipsmack] i mean going just 

180.43 183.78 B: twenty miles away i tend to take about a 

183.86 185.76 B: whole bunch of bags so 

185.90 190.76 B: if i was going for a long time [sigh] i'd need a whole steamer trunk [lipsmack] 

190.55 191.70 A: mhm 

191.40 204.82 B: and i i don't feel i just don't feel good about the going through i don't mind them looking at the things and checking the bags but i really don't feel comfortable with having all of my things strewn all over the place um 

203.39 205.75 A: no that's not a nice feeling 

205.44 209.53 B: [laughter] and like i said i'm not a light packer so 

209.61 218.44 B: um i can just see it a couple of my under wire bras would set off something and next thing you know we'll have a whole display of my underclothes 

213.80 214.87 A: mhm 

217.85 219.26 A: mhm 

218.64 222.06 B: so no i mean uh it's just it's not worth the hassle of 

222.32 224.94 B: of traveling uh 

225.92 238.61 B: [noise] [lipsmack] and unfortunately because you know it's fun to be able to go i was the type of person i used to like to just say i think i'll go this weekend get uh the cheapest rate i could and then go 

238.44 239.60 A: mhm 

239.54 246.74 B: uh [mn] which you know now huh well it's like i i wouldn't [sigh] i'm just content to stay 

246.76 249.67 B: within the con- confines of the united states [lipsmack] 

249.41 250.68 A: mhm 

250.55 252.86 B: i don't i don't really care about going 

253.16 257.74 B: if i ca- if i can drive there well you know i'll hop in the car and um go for 

257.05 265.94 A: i think a lot of people think feel like that now [lipsmack] they prefer to just get in the car where they can at time where they're going they know 

265.88 279.81 A: approximately you know how long everything's gonna take where to stop you go to the airport and maybe because of security you're held up for maybe an hour then if you miss your flight then they want you to pay extra money now and 

271.12 271.88 B: (( it huh )) 

276.44 277.33 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

279.89 291.27 B: yeah i m- i mean you know they want you to get there an hour early which translated means you'd better get there an hour and a half early well by the time you leave you could practically drive to where you're going mhm 

282.81 283.78 A: mhm 

286.63 288.06 A: mhm 

291.14 303.13 A: true my son has found that that he's there's been quite a few times lately where he's just gotten uh come out of the airport got in a rental car and drove home and got here as quickly as the flight 

302.78 304.07 B: yeah i mean 

303.27 305.05 A: but i- it's gotta get better 

304.70 312.49 B: well uh and as far as going to see new things uh there's it's like [mn] i'm not i never was the type of person that would say oh i think i wanna go 

312.67 314.63 B: and see this or that 

314.70 318.02 B: uh you know actually see a f- a landmark in person 

317.96 319.34 A: mhm 

318.78 323.84 B: um i mean i can look at a photo of it if i'm that you know if i'm that interested 

323.89 326.36 B: um when i i guess when i was 

326.78 330.90 B: y- when i was younger even a very little girl my parents took me all around 

331.43 335.51 B: and i saw just about everything you know that i wanted to see 

334.91 336.36 A: mhm 

335.79 336.88 B: (( um )) 

337.05 342.15 B: and uh now it's not so important to be physically in the place to see it 

341.20 342.22 A: mhm 

342.52 343.89 B: so i mean i've [mn] 

344.11 345.95 B: in the past i would say in 

346.20 348.54 B: [mn] since nine one one [mn] 

348.78 358.21 B: i've been just content to go to some of the um the nicer embassy suite hotels which have i mean they all look alike they're uh 

358.53 362.72 B: the same here as they would be in another city or another state 

362.75 363.92 B: and just 

364.03 367.70 B: have a nice um relaxing weekend there 

367.62 368.72 A: mhm 

368.31 373.37 B: uh close to home and uh it's just as if i've gone away 

373.68 375.85 B: it's not like i'm um 

376.20 387.99 B: gonna be doing anything any differently they have the same indoor pool and the restaurants and different things and i'm not gonna be driving that you know driving that far

411.08 412.16 A: oh okay

425.04 426.00 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

425.44 429.42 B: so i'm sure it would not be like back in the good old days 

428.77 431.74 A: no i guess it would be pretty different now 

430.83 436.89 B: [laughter] you know but w- we tri- i mean they took me i can remember well i can't remember but i can 

437.02 443.19 B: remember being told and i know that they took me they took me to niagara falls when i was two years old

443.54 447.70 B: you know but i mean i can and in a way i can almost remember 

447.84 451.40 B: [mn] i remember it was cold and damp 

451.68 456.46 B: i can remember running around outside back then they used to rent uh

460.16 461.48 A: yes uh-huh 

461.59 469.59 B: and i can remember you know they'd say [lipsmack] now don't go f- well we'd be running in and out in and out now don't go far don't go far um 

469.60 474.61 B: and we'd be running round outside outside of the trailer lodge or whatever it was
