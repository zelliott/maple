16.85 23.60 B: um you you can't do that or it's gonna get dis- no you can't do that because it'll disconnect no no they said it'll invalidate it 

20.33 22.91 A: you can't do it okay all right 

23.26 29.18 A: okay so we won't do that thanks okay thank you th- for clarifying that um 

23.84 26.35 B: (( so and i don't wanna this [laughter] [laughter] )) 

29.55 31.91 B: oh it's a hard question [laughter] 

31.21 33.73 A: yeah i didn't get the question really hm 

33.14 38.90 B: oh okay they said if you could go back in time and change something that you did what would it be and why 

40.37 40.98 B: (( [noise] )) 

40.80 45.45 A: well maybe i'll let you talk for a while and i'll listen and then i'll try to talk 

42.84 44.30 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

45.86 49.40 B: well you know i really like everything that i've done [laughter] in my life 

48.81 49.89 A: you do 

49.88 50.73 B: um 

50.03 55.06 A: that's very fortunate you mean if i beep t- just to see who this is i would lose you 

54.99 55.93 B: right 

55.99 63.16 B: yeah and then it's gonna screw things up for me royally because i have to pay [laughter] i this is the first time i tried calling in 

56.02 56.89 A: oh 

58.63 60.27 A: okay i won't do that 

61.52 65.28 A: somebody is very insistent on calling me oh 

63.85 66.90 B: (( yeah it's probably a telemarketer [laughter] )) 

65.98 72.03 A: no i think it might be that i have several calls coming in i just wish i could tell them to please call back um 

68.81 69.63 B: oh okay 

71.11 80.47 B: no i read somewhere that somebody else said that they do i was waiting for them to call me for about three weeks already and they never did so i decided to take it into my own hands finally 

72.20 73.03 A: okay 

77.43 78.65 A: i see 

79.04 83.06 A: so are you glad that you got into this program [laughter] 

81.31 86.93 B: [laughter] maybe i could back in time and change that no i haven't gotten paid yet did you make any calls yet 

86.35 88.51 A: i made onl- this is the second call 

88.25 93.48 B: second one yeah this is my second now so i figured maybe if i make two more then they'll pay me for the three other ones 

93.65 99.15 B: and i had two people to refer maybe they're waiting for that and maybe thinking that i'm gonna get more 

97.81 100.75 A: well have you ha- have you already made three calls 

100.45 109.04 B: no the first one they called me and that was on my regular phone and i couldn't accept it because i didn't have a touchtone to put in my pin number 

108.77 109.75 A: mhm 

109.38 114.23 B: so i had to call them and give them my cellphone number but i didn't want to do that because i pay per minute so 

114.17 125.04 B: if i don't get paid for it then i'm just wasting minutes on my cellphone like twenty five cents a minute [laughter] so i don't really wanna screw this up so [lipsmack] anyway the first call i had was talking about 

117.65 118.60 A: yeah 

119.70 120.89 A: oh goodness 

125.08 128.55 B: um business like if you wanted to start your own home business 

128.40 129.39 A: mhm 

128.61 136.90 B: so that was easier but like and i'm thinking maybe i wouldn't have gone to work on the day that i slipped and broke my ankle a couple of years ago [laughter] 

135.62 142.65 A: oh isn't that interesting yeah maybe you would've stayed home and taken it easy that day and called in sick right 

140.74 144.78 B: [laughter] but you never know [laughter] right i actually that was 

143.33 145.36 A: that's that's really interesting 

145.07 154.67 B: the only time that i ever called in sick to my current job though 'cause i love it so much i go in with migraines and colds and whatever but that day i had never 

151.85 152.91 A: wow 

154.92 157.22 B: known how to even call in and i 

157.31 162.52 B: had my dad carry me back in from the curb and i was in my uniform and just called and said 

162.66 166.55 B: [lipsmack] um i have to go to the hospital but i'll be in later today 

166.10 169.28 A: [laughter] what kind of work are you is that doing 

167.05 167.71 B: (( [laughter] )) 

168.32 175.65 B: [laughter] um it's really fun it's at the airport and it's the detroit airport that's really busy the hub for north west 

176.00 180.25 B: so we even get celebrities coming in we've seen pamela anderson a few times 

180.85 181.89 B: and um 

182.11 191.36 B: it's just selling newspapers and gum and candy and stuff mainly but there are some specialty stores like golf or g._m. 

191.71 202.48 B: type t. shirts and hats and stuff like that and some of 'em are sports related so we get all the detroit teams and i'm sure there's a lot of famous basketball players around but i don't know who they are [laughter] so 

202.42 204.37 A: i see mhm 

203.38 205.13 B: [sigh] they're just tall guys 

204.40 208.71 A: whoever this is is trying to reach me is really being persistent i i i can't 

207.51 209.62 B: (( we only have five minutes left huh )) 

209.10 216.34 A: yeah but i think that by that time they'll give up but it must it must have beeped already ten times in my ear you probably don't hear it right 

214.20 215.22 B: you didn't have 

215.78 218.29 B: no i can't hear it so you don't have voicemail 

216.72 217.74 A: no i 

218.31 226.33 A: um no they can't leave a message so i don't know who it is i hope it's not the person i was supposed to meet at three o'clock [laughter] 

218.67 220.06 B: (( they can't leave you a mess- )) 

221.91 222.62 B: (( hm no )) 

225.02 232.10 B: maybe it's another person from this thing trying to send well okay can you think of something 'cause my half of the time is up like what would you 

231.07 233.51 A: yeah uh well um 

234.75 242.88 A: [sigh] gosh i i suppose i could say a lotta things but uh you know um that i might really redo over again 

242.96 246.06 A: um one of them um 

246.17 252.39 A: but then you know i mean many times i i have thoughts about this because when my mom was very ill 

252.38 266.36 A: i um had her she was in my house uh and then she stepped out one day and it was in snowstorm and she fell and broke several bones and she went to the hospital 

266.29 275.21 A: and they called and told me to come over to the emergency room and when i did she then was um uh you know she was 

275.24 278.21 A: she really had to go through a very long recuperation 

278.18 287.98 A: and they wanted me to send her to a nursing home in i mean at upon discharge they wanted me to have her go to a nursing home um 

278.28 279.36 B: mhm 

287.91 298.17 A: and i said i went to visit the nursing home and i was just a mess at that point i couldn't relate to any of these nursing homes i couldn't relate to her being in there i couldn't accept the fact that she was so ill 

298.07 299.04 B: mhm 

298.36 306.98 A: and i was really upset and i i don't know what i saw at the nursing home that day and frankly there was a smell there of urine 

307.02 309.22 A: um i couldn't see her there 

307.29 307.91 B: (( mm )) 

309.29 315.21 A: and 'cause she was very very clean and very neat and even though the nursing home l- it looked very 

315.04 326.76 A: you know it looked very sparse and the you know really like the um really utilitarian but there was a very very strong smell of urine and i guess it's because sometimes maybe the mattresses get soaked and i don't know 

325.63 326.73 B: (( ugh yeah mm )) 

326.69 329.63 A: but it was it was um it was repulsive to me 

329.48 341.58 A: and um and i uh i i i did not allow her to go there you know i didn't i in fact i took her home and it was it was really really hard for the next year and a half or two years we struggled struggled struggled 

341.41 349.50 A: that might be something i might try to redo i might try to you know re- really talk to the staff and say i don't really wouldn't you know 'cause 

349.35 357.84 A: subsequent to that i had a friend who went there and i mean although it wasn't a perfect experience it was a sociable experience for him 

357.69 371.24 A: y- you know and i think in the end i had to have her go to a home which uh which which was really far from here it was really hard i was going almost every other day i was traveling um like four hours a day to 

358.64 359.52 B: mhm 

371.14 373.82 A: you know two hours to get there two hours to get home 

372.85 374.19 B: wow [laughter] 

373.71 387.08 A: and she wanted me to be there eight hours a day so i was totally exhausted and i and i wanted to be there you know with her too um but it was a- and it was in the country i thought that would make her feel better but in a way it was run by sisters 

375.93 377.14 B: (( really [laughter] )) 

377.47 378.86 B: yeah no other life 

386.91 399.11 A: and uh i thought you know if she were to get kind of snappy to people they were more trained to you know be more devoted than you know 'cause i didn't know what kin- what who would be taking care of her in any other nursing home 

398.91 399.73 B: right 

399.12 400.96 A: and she might insult them 

400.98 414.14 A: and uh but sometimes i've wondered because she did seem to do pretty well for a while uh suddenly after a while she got used to sorta being there but especially when there was sort of a social component to it 'cause she was really she didn't like being alone 

414.12 429.02 A: although she was quite moody so um i'm thinking maybe it was a mistake not to um have tried to a little harder to get her into that first nursing home before i even took her back into my home and things got even more deteriorated i don't know 

428.15 428.87 B: (( mm mm )) 

428.87 431.37 A: it was a very difficult time in my life 

432.24 442.29 A: so i and and and i'm sure it was an extraordinarily difficult time for her but caretakers you know almost have a situation almost as difficult as the patient sometimes 

441.67 445.39 B: yeah i don't know how they could stand working in a place that smells so bad [noise] 

445.00 457.87 A: well that's a good question you know i mean i don't know 'cause it was so strange sometimes you know they'll give you a tour of places and um they don't realize what a bad thing they're doing when they give you a tour of a place that really 

451.53 452.54 B: mhm 

456.18 457.02 B: (( mhm )) 

457.68 460.31 A: you know looks clean but smells bad 

459.74 463.91 B: (( yeah yeah maybe they get used to it [laughter] maybe their nose gets desensitive [laughter] )) 

461.97 467.50 A: maybe they don't even recognize it but i mean it was like so strong to me i couldn't get over it 

467.93 470.97 B: oh i've thought of something that i would really change and not 

468.11 468.85 A: so 

470.23 471.41 A: w- you have 

471.19 483.85 B: [laughter] don't lend money to friends boy i lost out so much already because i trusted them just because they were my friends and there's one i'm never gonna speak to her again because she thought since we were friends 

475.49 476.58 A: really 

483.77 493.25 B: it was okay if she didn't pay me back but she didn't bother to tell me this so she just kept like doing me favors and hoping that i'd forget that she owed me over two hundred in cash [laughter] 

492.72 493.71 A: uh-huh 

493.65 505.68 B: and then it came to the point where she started lying to people and saying that she paid me back and i was charging her interest and i found out what a [mn] person she was so [lipsmack] i am not talking to her anymore but 

500.44 501.55 A: oh 

505.57 513.43 B: it still is on my mind all the time when i have a bill to pay and i think well i could really use that two hundred and fifty dollars [laughter] so i mean 

512.31 522.26 A: yeah and then also there's this sort of disruption in in in the personal c- you know situation it's sorta like y- y- you have it on you to forgive her really 

519.31 520.01 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

522.33 537.19 A: you know if you do something for somebody and then they don't live up to their part of the bargain it's sort of like to on the person who really put the effort forth i mean the onus is on you they're putting you in a position where you're sort of holding something against that person 

535.75 536.58 B: right 

536.70 537.70 B: mhm 

537.10 538.67 A: and that's no good for you 

538.63 550.65 B: and that's how she makes me feel like oh you want so much from me it's like well you promised to pay back it was always a loan it wasn't to give it to you and it was christmas or something and i gave you a check that'd be different but 

538.83 539.81 A: you know 

546.68 548.33 A: yeah yeah 

550.56 560.70 B: you just like ch- uh no well it wasn't i- in that situation i found out i wasn't the worst of everything she'd done 'cause there was another mutual friend that has told me 

560.66 568.31 B: she tried to get him to do things that were illegal even so that she could save money on stuff like the car insurance and things so [laughter] 

567.42 577.18 A: well it's really sad that the people feel that they need to do that and i guess at times we've all done things that we're not really too happy about you know what i mean uh 

571.37 572.24 B: right 

575.87 584.34 B: uh but no if you need more money you go get a second job or you work more overtime or something you don't take it from your friends and then stab 'em in the back [laughter] and tell lies about them 

584.48 589.15 A: yeah but some people can't even work they're on disability and they can't work without 

584.51 585.77 B: so i mean i- it's 

588.09 599.89 B: oh she could i mean yeah she was when i loaned it to her she didn't wanna work 'cause she was kinda depressed over losing another job and another relationship so i felt sorry for her and i said sure i know you're gonna get a job eventually 

589.73 590.98 A: she could
