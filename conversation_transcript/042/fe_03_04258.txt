292.35 294.63 A: back to israel where they came from 

294.86 295.42 A: (( [cough] )) 

295.90 299.26 A: and they kind of left a bunch of us high and dry a dozen or so 

299.32 300.68 B: oh man 

300.95 301.59 A: (( [cough] [lipsmack] )) 

301.70 305.93 A: and so then i did some work in i did some work in 

306.65 308.64 A: a delivery business 

308.46 309.35 B: mhm 

309.84 312.52 A: i did some work in sales and 

313.99 322.65 A: and some work in customer service and right now i don't have anything i'm just i'm an editor but i just i mean i'm like self employed as a 

316.33 317.66 B: (( mhm [sigh] )) 

323.63 330.59 B: yeah it it's really um our our business took a beating after s- well of course you know many obviously many people did but 

330.50 334.10 B: being that our business is air freight and then you know when when 

333.94 340.45 B: [laughter] when you can't fly any planes after september eleventh it really [sigh] it really put a crunch on us and [sigh] 

340.39 354.46 B: we were very fortunate that we also have trucks in the you know the chicago area we've got seven trucks so we were [sigh] still able to you know we had to let a lot of people go [sigh] but at least we were still able to keep our business but we you know 

354.29 359.16 B: if we didn't have our l- our trucks for local deliveries we would have gone out of business 

359.24 362.84 B: [sigh] and it's slowly picking up now but um 

363.12 368.55 B: [lipsmack] you know it it it it's tough being self employed very very very tough these days 

368.39 372.38 A: how did the u._p._s. strike affect you back in ninety seven 

372.07 373.32 B: [sigh] [sigh] um 

373.46 374.02 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

374.33 385.23 B: it af- the way it affected us is the um [lipsmack] we had some late deliveries because people who normally would ship u._p._s. [sigh] were then shipping fedex and airborne 

385.06 396.71 B: d._h._l. people who had never used them before [sigh] so then they taking on the new business they they they took on more business than they could um handle 

396.80 407.57 B: [sigh] so then all of a sudden you get backlogs and delays [sigh] um i know that um fedex had a new policy after that inc- or after that um [sigh] that 

407.50 412.58 B: anyone new they would only take on so many 

412.72 426.78 B: in other words if you ca- if you normally used u._p._s. and you have twenty shipments a day they're not going to give you they're not going to allot you that they they'll say okay well you can ship a couple [sigh] that we will guarantee but we will not guarantee the rest 

427.35 433.86 A: yeah that's the problem that we had i was working with quill at the time they're over there in uh lincolnshire 

433.57 434.52 B: mhm 

434.60 437.43 A: uh it's in the northwest 

436.87 439.24 B: (( oh i know where that is but mhm )) 

437.54 438.34 A: (( just a )) 

438.58 440.05 A: oh you know where it is 

439.38 440.20 B: right 

440.54 446.03 A: and um [cough] we we did eighty five percent of our business with fedex 

446.60 453.67 A: i mean with u._p._s. and fedex just wouldn't help us out because they knew we weren't going to stay with them after it was over 

452.95 454.11 B: right 

454.81 462.61 A: and the postal service couldn't help us out they they just didn't have the facilities or the capability or whatever 

454.99 455.65 B: so 

463.66 467.50 A: and that uh that about put us out of business i tell you 

467.32 472.34 B: [lipsmack] oh it it it it's terrible it it's terrible when you [sigh] you know they 

472.57 474.43 B: they become monopolies 

474.55 482.03 B: you know they say you know like when they deregulate the you know the gas companies [sigh] you know you think everything's going to be s- 

482.19 486.01 B: it seems like every time they deregulate something it gets worse 

487.99 501.59 B: or at least [laughter] at least it does for us here [sigh] like when they de- you know deregulated the um the gas companies oh you know [sigh] it'll be easier it'll be better more competitive and then they all raised the rates well look what happened to enron [laughter] 

499.81 505.30 A: yeah i remember i remember when they deregulated the phone company 

504.88 505.68 B: yeah 

505.54 508.99 A: and i thought that was like the dumbest thing 

509.04 510.09 A: ever

511.14 511.98 A: uh

520.08 531.11 B: you know we've had uh you know oh you know s- i would never use sprint or m._c._i. be- i mean i'm sure people swear by them but [sigh] i've had bad experiences with both of them and 

531.16 534.87 B: to get through to someone these days just is absolutely crazy 

534.83 537.30 B: especially a big company like that
