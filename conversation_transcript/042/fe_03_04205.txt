225.55 226.36 A: yeah 

228.57 229.34 A: yeah 

228.73 234.18 B: it just that if you do you know it's worth it 'cause some o- and ev- some of it was even tax free

243.99 245.39 B: (( [noise] uh )) 

244.92 246.78 A: what would work for you [mn] 

246.14 250.63 B: well right now i have this website called small business [noise] 

247.71 248.47 A: (( uh-huh )) 

250.67 251.96 B: small biz 

252.59 260.12 B: and i'm trying to make that work but like i said so far i only got two people to sign up under me but they've you know 

258.27 259.20 A: uh-huh 

260.15 262.61 B: you're supposed to get ten thousand hits a day 

262.49 263.33 A: uh-huh 

262.82 275.68 B: and they s- guarantee they don't guarantee but they tell ya that one outta ten people sign up well one outta ten people haven't signed up [noise] if ten thousand one outta ten that would at least be a thousand i haven't got but two so 

273.67 274.58 A: uh-huh 

275.22 276.53 A: yeah 

275.94 281.52 B: and you have to pay for the website and they supposed to send you customers and then you're supposed to get your own customers 

281.26 282.09 A: uh-huh 

281.69 293.86 B: [noise] and every place on the internet you know i put in my website and they send hits there in one place i think i sent five thousand visitors somewhere else ten thousand hits but 

287.48 288.33 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

293.95 303.78 B: it's like everybody's doing it so even though i'm doing all the work too somebody else is doing that same work and it seemed like a lotta people are doing the same work so 

302.53 303.40 A: right 

303.90 310.98 B: [noise] i guess they do it like me they get it off the internet but they don't really read it they just look at it they just glance at it like i do i just read the title 

307.29 308.02 A: right 

310.70 311.60 A: mhm 

310.83 319.59 B: if it's something interesting i might open it but they could send you visitors and hits all they want to if the person don't open it up and read it you're not gonna get to sell it 

313.51 314.53 A: yeah 

319.37 320.40 A: right 

320.21 323.97 B: and i guess too many people are trying to [noise] [laughter] 

323.50 324.51 A: yeah 

324.12 325.64 B: (( sell on the internet )) 

325.95 327.07 A: (( [sigh] yeah hm )) 

326.61 339.31 B: [lipsmack] so that's i guess that's the problem i'm running up again- but when i first read it you know it sounded [noise] well it sounded too good to be true and now i'm saying that it is i'm might be able to send ten thousand people to your website and that you know one outta ten 

327.74 328.71 A: mhm 

337.34 338.21 A: right 

339.06 339.98 A: mhm 

339.70 341.56 B: so i even bought the thing 

341.49 342.43 A: yeah 

341.59 349.12 B: and i only made my money back my money that's one good thing about it though if you make a sale you get half of it so 

344.87 346.71 A: yeah [laughter] 

348.06 349.98 A: so what do you what do you sell 

350.40 353.15 B: just another website i sell websites to 

352.17 354.18 A: oh i see you sell website yeah 

353.40 355.97 B: yeah the same website 

355.64 356.47 A: (( [mn] uh-huh )) 

356.40 358.01 B: so but 

357.37 358.79 A: (( oh very good )) 

358.56 368.17 B: it's it could be a profitable if i got more customers 'cause you could have in two sales you'd make your your money back and so far i've just broken even but i haven't made no profit 

361.26 362.04 A: yeah 

366.36 367.11 A: right 

367.67 368.66 A: yeah 

368.91 371.19 B: so that's the only bad thing about it 

370.93 371.85 A: yeah 

372.04 376.50 B: and i don't know why i haven't got more customers or more people wanna get their own website
