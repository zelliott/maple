287.47 300.89 A: having children earlier i was twenty years between my kids [laughter] [laughter] so that that's another one but then of course that has to do with the decisions i made to leave you know leave that earlier the other my other 

290.88 291.86 B: oh really 

299.80 303.06 B: [noise] the reason you'd want to have them closer is because of uh
