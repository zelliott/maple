1.18 2.41 A: hello 

4.92 8.05 A: [sigh] pretty good my name is tim how're ya doing today 

7.05 9.03 B: i'm doing good man 

8.91 10.39 A: [laughter] 

9.71 14.19 B: and uh so what are we what are we supposed to be doing just talking about the time travel deal 

13.87 18.15 A: yep yep well th- the specific uh uh ha- have you done one of these studies before 

16.23 16.89 B: (( uh )) 

17.53 21.16 B: (( no no i haven't yeah it'll be my first time doing this )) 

18.39 19.88 A: it's your first time 

20.97 24.53 A: okay yeah i've d- i think this is my like fourth time 

23.93 25.37 B: oh really okay 

24.71 34.04 A: yeah so um yeah so the the general category was uh time travel but the specific question was if you could go back in time and change something 

33.87 35.33 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

34.46 36.33 A: uh what would it be 

36.32 46.62 B: [noise] oh if that was possible um basically i guess it's kind of a tra- tragic deal to where i lost my cousin about oh it's about seven years ago [sigh] 

46.46 47.43 A: okay 

46.89 54.72 B: and uh we had been out that night and uh he wanted to you know stay out a little bit longer and wanted you know actually i think spend a night over at 

54.53 65.34 B: my house and you know if he we w- would have done what he wanted to do [sigh] instead of him going home because basically initially what happened that night [sigh] uh somebody broke into their house and actually shot him 

65.29 76.68 B: uh so if i could take that back and you know i would definitely you know uh you know just at all possible just avoid him going home that d- that night so yeah that 

65.35 66.51 A: oh my goodness 

73.83 75.05 A: [noise] wow 

75.25 77.97 A: wh- wh- where did that happen 

77.16 81.41 B: [sigh] it actually happened [noise] here in dallas here in richardson [noise] in texas 

80.56 81.83 A: (( okay [noise] )) 

81.57 95.11 B: so yeah about seven years ago and uh you know [sigh] 'cause he basically just wanted to spend some time 'cause i i was off to college at that time [noise] and so the next day really i was supposed to go back you know for uh for spring sessions for the spring semester and so 

95.32 98.33 B: you know so that that's what happened there [laughter] 

98.19 99.62 A: [noise] wow 

99.36 101.13 B: yeah 

99.88 101.67 A: [noise] i'm really sorry to hear that [noise] 

101.42 103.60 B: yeah yeah so 

103.81 107.54 B: that pretty much uh you know and at that time you know i was pretty [sigh] 

107.40 118.97 B: uh i was a sophomore and you know and that time really you know i had never had an impact like that as far as losing a family relative that you know close to me you know you hear about people dying in the news [sigh] 

118.84 123.39 B: but you know you never thought that really happens to you until it happens so 

119.50 120.51 A: yeah 

123.42 131.03 B: uh so it's kind of you know it's kind of hard for me to accept that for a while so that's the situation now 

127.72 129.07 A: yeah 

130.83 134.01 A: yeah i could see how you might want to go back and uh 

134.00 135.81 B: yeah 

134.82 139.06 A: and change that but uh [sigh] that's not really necessarily something that uh 

139.09 143.35 A: you know that you could have done much about i guess really yeah 

139.28 140.15 B: (( hm )) 

142.66 148.78 B: yeah so you know who wasn't to say you know if uh if i could you know maybe 

148.80 156.75 B: you know something that that some some oth- some other family member would have probably taken it you know the shot what have you so you never know 

155.71 157.05 A: yeah 

157.11 158.40 A: yeah 

158.85 165.14 A: [sigh] well jeeze i don't have anything uh [sigh] anything of that kind of magnitude um 

165.65 174.34 A: [lipsmack] luckily i haven't had any like r- major like family tragedies or at least or you know at least i mean i've had certainly death in the family but nothing 

168.96 170.37 B: [noise] oh yeah 

174.41 175.67 A: (( you know )) 

175.73 188.24 A: sort of like on the scale that you're describing you know mostly it's family members dying from old age or dying from [noise] disease and [sigh] there's not a heck of a lot i could have done uh particularly different [sigh] but um 

178.01 179.68 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

181.05 182.23 B: yeah 

182.71 184.03 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

188.31 190.78 A: i think one thing i would've um [lipsmack] 

190.85 195.20 A: if i could go back and and change something you know change a decision in my life 

195.36 205.02 A: um [lipsmack] i think i would have gone to a different college and i know th- that might you know like not a huge deal but i 

202.47 203.90 B: (( [lipsmack] oh oh really )) 

205.02 207.33 A: so i went um [lipsmack] 

207.20 215.98 A: i went to boston college um i heard but the i i'm up in the northeast i uh i'm in uh right now i'm i'm living in providence rhode island 

208.73 209.72 B: (( oh okay )) 

211.00 212.06 B: (( oh okay )) 

215.22 216.14 B: uh-huh 

215.83 223.01 A: but i'm originally from new jersey and i went to college in uh you know in boston college in boston [sigh] and um 

222.91 234.85 A: when i when i was in high school you know i mean when you know when i was figuring out where i was going to go to college and or trying to figure out you know the guidance counsellors were always telling you oh you should go here and here and like 

228.19 229.35 B: (( yeah exactly )) 

234.41 235.43 B: okay 

235.09 240.07 A: i really didn't all i know is i wanted to get out of the house [laughter] and i i couldn't 

239.09 241.02 B: (( oh yeah oh god )) 

240.24 242.59 A: could- couldn't wait to um 

242.61 246.77 A: [lipsmack] couldn't wait to go off to college and and do my own thing and have my freedom and 

246.49 247.43 B: uh-huh 

247.09 252.87 A: everything like that but i had no er like in high school i had no idea what i wanted in a college you know i 

252.51 253.81 B: yeah 

252.99 266.09 A: i mean i think i i wound up applying to like city schools and co- you know schools out in the in rural areas and [sigh] big schools and small schools and conservatives and you know liberal schools and 

265.33 266.52 B: yeah 

265.88 280.67 A: and just the whole like wide range for no no particular rhyme or reason except you know basically th- the one the different schools i visited like some just had kind of a vibe that seemed you know like you know like i wanted to be there but i had no idea what i really 

267.99 268.94 B: uh-huh 

277.18 278.19 B: mhm 

280.51 281.79 B: wanted 

280.74 282.54 A: wanted to get out of college 

282.18 283.31 B: (( oh okay )) 

282.47 296.09 A: um [lipsmack] and so i went to boston college firstly because you know when i visited it was a very pretty school um you know architecturally [sigh] and the school was supposed to be good and i got in which is uh you know an added bonus [noise] [sigh] um [lipsmack] 

288.44 289.50 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

295.95 297.60 A: but uh 

297.84 309.71 A: after i was there for like even like my first semester i i [sigh] i was not i was never like [noise] extremely happy there well i mean like with the school i i had a good time in college and everything [sigh] but um it's a very s- 

309.54 313.40 A: very very sports focussed school and i'm not at all a sports fan 

313.01 315.86 B: (( [noise] oh yeah i was going to say it's a good uh football college [laughter] )) 

314.66 321.42 A: [noise] oh my goodness huge football is like so huge on campus [sigh] and um 

316.30 317.96 B: (( it's a great yeah )) 

319.24 320.39 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

321.61 331.82 A: [sigh] and a- and and to a lesser extent uh basketball but um [sigh] you know so it's always just a very sports focussed school and it was also a very conservative kind of a place 

331.35 332.58 B: (( oh yeah )) 

332.02 342.95 A: um i just didn't i mean it's not like i'm some like you know like crazy wild liberal or anything [sigh] but uh i definitely found like i that [sigh] i didn't find a lot of diversity on campus 

342.34 343.61 B: (( [noise] oh okay )) 

342.79 354.27 A: uh in terms of just like opinions and lifestyles and stuff like that [sigh] it seemed like everybody there was like okay it's saturday we're going to a football game like everywhere on campus would be deserted 

354.02 355.50 B: [laughter] okay 

354.30 361.85 A: you know and everyone would be down like you know [sigh] doing keg stands and you know like in the parking lot at the uh at the stadium 

360.73 362.10 B: football [laughter] 

361.97 363.66 A: (( and um [lipsmack] )) 

363.82 370.89 A: and it so i mean after i got to school i real- i mean i was very happy being in boston boston's a great city if you've never been i i don't know 

370.18 373.59 B: no i haven't i i've never never travelled through the northeast 

371.22 372.47 A: oh it's a r- 

372.99 387.46 A: oh i definitely recommend it if you ever get a chance to 'cause it's really really nice [sigh] but uh so i enjoyed being there um but i would've gone [sigh] i think i would have picked a uh different school well you know a little bit more of a varied school [sigh] um but in the long run i mean and you know 

382.41 383.66 B: oh yeah 

384.56 385.69 B: yeah 

387.25 402.07 A: i'm certainly happy i went there i had a good education i loved being in boston great place to be going to college 'cause it's it's just a major college town [sigh] and plus um my freshman year i met uh i i met my future wife who i 

401.22 402.18 B: (( oh [lipsmack] )) 

402.05 409.15 A: who and now we've been to- let's see that was see that was just a little over uh ten years ago it was ten years ago in february so 

408.07 409.44 B: oh yeah okay 

409.49 419.44 A: so uh so you know i guess i guess had i not gone to boston college and not gone out on a particular night and gone to a particular club [sigh] then i wouldn't have met her um 

417.05 417.95 B: uh-huh 

419.25 424.60 A: though who knows if i went somewhere else i probably might have would have met someone different and you know that's 

424.38 427.10 B: (( yeah that's the way it would've work out [laughter] )) 

426.46 435.95 A: yeah i mean i'm not like a huge believer in fate or anything i mean like i i don't feel like all of this is like the one you know person who i could've met but uh 

429.32 431.24 B: oh yeah 

433.14 434.83 B: yeah 

435.01 440.69 B: but basically it's like knowing that you have control of your own destiny although it's not set set set in stone [laughter] 

437.94 439.12 A: oh yeah 

440.50 446.02 A: yeah yeah [sigh] well both of us er we always talk about this 'cause we're always amazed in like you know people are like oh you know 

446.28 455.44 A: i got to find the one the person for me like you know i met the the the one person who's right for me i'm like well you know you you could fall in love with a lot of people you know 

455.03 455.97 B: uh-huh 

455.52 458.17 A: like the coin- the chance of like someone 

458.13 472.71 A: like if if if everyone in the world is made to be with somebody else the odds of you ever meeting that person would be so incontestably small you know 'cause like wh- who's to say that person wouldn't wouldn't be like a goat herder in you know in nepal or something like that 

464.92 466.27 B: (( uh-huh yep )) 

470.44 473.30 B: [laughter] [lipsmack] yeah 

472.69 481.23 A: but um but anyway so i'm getting off track but i would say i'd go i i would've um done a bit differently and perhaps gone to a different college 

478.30 479.10 B: done 

480.84 481.85 B: (( [noise] oh okay [noise] )) 

481.73 489.14 A: but uh er not that it really made a huge difference i mean i'm fairly happy with uh with my life [noise] so [sigh] 

488.59 489.75 B: (( [noise] oh okay )) 

489.37 495.16 A: so anyway [noise] so can you uh think of any others er think of anything else while i was babbling on 

491.01 491.68 B: (( mm )) 

493.76 497.42 B: well on that same on on on that same note i would say 

497.34 503.72 B: yeah definitely i i don't think i would have changed as far as going to a different college i think i would have [sigh] uh 

503.61 509.34 B: now knowing what i know now i definitely would have pursued my major a lot quicker instead of just going through uh 

509.18 520.63 B: uh my first freshman and got a sophomore in college as a you know just general studies i would and uh 'cause i ended up spending there six years [laughter] [sigh] so i was there for a long time in my and um so 

514.02 515.00 A: yeah 

517.48 518.38 A: yeah 

520.30 521.62 A: what was your major 

521.30 525.28 B: uh i majored in industrial distribution which is half engineering half business 

525.04 525.96 A: okay 

525.32 536.34 B: so and i went to tex a and m. university down here in texas [sigh] and like yourself i i i really didn't uh basically i was actually um uh first time um [lipsmack] 

529.14 530.10 A: okay 

536.42 542.36 B: first first family member to go ever go to college so i had a big burden on myself [laughter] going 

539.13 540.54 A: (( oh congratulations )) 

541.58 544.71 A: so was that so you were in uh college station then 

544.38 546.35 B: yeah in college station exactly 

545.66 550.80 A: so were you were you were you uh in college there when they had that uh the big 

549.86 551.56 B: the tragedy with the bonfire 

551.39 552.69 A: yeah 

552.08 560.33 B: yeah yeah i was there uh yeah that was a real like i you had if you've never seen a town that's been down i i mean 

553.45 554.70 A: oh wow 

560.33 572.16 B: wow you talk about you know you could actually be a visitor and you go visit that town [sigh] there in that time and you can just feel the atmosphere as far as the sadness and and everybody being down on that so much 

572.04 574.26 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

572.22 575.94 B: i mean it it is so but yeah i was there when that occurred 

576.02 577.04 A: yeah 

576.14 582.15 B: unfortunately so that was an unfortunate incident but uh yeah i think i probably would've you know 

582.55 591.63 B: yeah i mean i enjoyed all my six [laughter] years there but [sigh] i think maybe in the long run i probably would've just gone and you know gotten my 

592.18 596.89 B: my major out of the way and been done with college but oh well [laughter] 

595.15 596.43 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

596.56 598.18 A: [laughter] and so 

596.93 599.89 B: and but then again you know i'm i'm kind of tired of
