31.18 32.49 A: okay and 

31.68 36.24 B: so if you had something to change that i'd go back in time had something to change 

35.32 37.73 A: w- well [sigh] 

38.52 43.19 A: let me see what would i change i i you know i i think i would 

43.36 46.69 A: change my decision making capability 

47.00 47.94 B: (( oh )) 

47.40 51.54 A: and how would i a- and and now i i can't can i ask you questions 

50.93 51.82 B: uh-huh 

51.64 56.02 A: okay how would i change those decision making capabilities 

53.50 54.47 B: mhm 

56.41 65.61 A: [lipsmack] if i'm twenty and i have the capability of a decision maker of twenty i think i wouldn't be so impetuous 

62.55 63.62 B: right 

65.77 74.57 A: you know what i mean 'cause i i i trust everybody until they until they give me a reason to mistrust them i'm a i'm not a cautious 

65.88 66.55 B: (( yes )) 

72.58 73.51 B: right 

74.62 84.79 A: person that way and it's gotten me into a a into a lot of trouble but you know what i can't help it i'm still that way to- i'm sixty i'm still that way today 

84.35 87.82 B: well that happens yeah i know what you mean there's a certain 

87.83 96.46 B: certain things one has you have faults and you have some- sometimes the faults are sometimes an advantages and sometimes they're disadvantages 

95.67 103.22 A: are are y- are you ah zu- real quick are you in the same situation i am y- they called you to call me type thing and we're discussing this 

102.70 106.72 B: yeah well i mean you know i called in and then they said please wait and um 

105.76 109.10 A: oh i see yeah that's good oh that's g- that's neat 

108.62 118.32 B: so ah you know i guess that's a good point i mean on the one hand you know we we can all say you know sort of hindsight is twenty twenty on the other hand it that's you know 

109.60 111.10 A: well na- 

111.94 112.50 A: (( [mn] )) 

117.89 121.80 A: but i think the ultimate fantasy is to know 

118.37 119.26 B: if you o- 

121.85 124.51 A: then what you know now 

123.61 125.84 B: (( exactly and unfor- [noise] )) 

125.00 130.36 A: but since it's a fantasy i guess we can't [laughter] talk about that [laughter] 

129.12 136.72 B: well i guess you know that's true and that and that is the problem i mean to the you know i i've there've i've decisions i've made in the past 

135.65 139.97 A: i think when it comes to money there's so many unscrupulous people 

139.99 151.87 A: i'm i'm into loving a person i'm into relationships i mean i i am a rich person i just don't have a lot of money i mean i've gone into millions of dollars worth of stuff but 

151.71 156.75 A: when money is involved then ah people become 

156.80 159.68 A: different you know they become greedy 

157.90 167.67 B: well i think that's why it's sometimes an advantage you know i so i take to try and tell my children so- it's an advantage in a way not to have money my my 

168.24 172.03 B: you know i have seen situations where people have have 

171.67 172.28 A: (( [noise] )) 

171.95 178.18 B: cheated people out of [sigh] something they had coming like for example ah friends of mine that have taken 

178.05 189.43 B: help care of an elderly person at the end of their life not expecting to to gain from it just you know that they would be you know say in their will or whatever they would just be recompensed for you know basically 

183.26 184.29 A: sure 

189.53 195.23 A: absolutely the love the love that they have for their friend yeah isn't that something 

189.63 191.65 B: what they put out and a 

191.70 193.53 B: and a friend of mine 

193.90 196.33 B: friend of mine made that decision and 

195.38 201.31 A: i try to put that in check as much as i can i mean it it's y- y- you think you know ah 

198.15 198.78 B: (( it )) 

201.39 207.72 A: ah everybody says well when so and so dies then you'll get a lotta money i don't wanna think that way i don't even s- 

206.49 210.80 B: no well no what i'm saying is is that what what has happened is that 

210.61 214.28 B: ah they they would if they had to do it over again they'd do it no matter what 

214.06 226.85 B: but for example i had a friend who ah took care of an elderly lady who then just basically didn't have a lot to leave her just i mean it still didn't compensate her for for having quit her job for a year to care for her you know basically over a year 

223.14 224.01 A: sure 

225.16 226.19 A: mhm 

226.71 235.80 B: and she would never have done you know she had to do it over again she would've done the same thing but the family it wasn't the lady it was the family of this woman who all of whom 

235.76 245.48 B: were very comfortably off and very well heeled they just resented that that small pittance going to 

245.86 258.86 B: you know going to that friend yeah so that's what i was talking about not not that in any way shape or form they were trying to get ahead financially but you see again and i know another situation where it happened too so actually what happens is is it's [sigh] 

246.84 249.18 A: the person that helped yeah [laughter] 

259.62 261.80 B: the people with the money [laughter] 

262.06 263.87 A: [laughter] 

262.43 266.55 B: just you know you know i mean the irony was that they didn't need that little bit of money 

265.18 271.33 A: you know we're trying to get we're trying to get as much information out as we possibly can let's just s- settle down and chat do they 

271.20 281.86 A: do they beep you or something after five minutes or s- something like that well they they i think they've got enough information you know i i i think both of us agree that ah 

273.76 274.65 B: yeah 

274.90 276.62 B: yeah no they basically tell you 

281.80 287.29 A: that family and ah and respect and ah self esteem and then all those 

287.16 297.02 A: accolades are more important than money and if we had to go back in time that we would probably put ourselves more in check 

297.18 307.85 A: with ah the people in other words being more sensitive to the fact that you know this guy's pretty greedy and i think there's trouble down the line where i was just blind to that [noise] 

307.06 311.38 B: right and i also think i my son was talking to me once and he said 

311.50 319.86 B: we were we were kind of discussing bad decisions that ah that my that my own father had made i actually was fortunate my mother and my stepfather were 

319.76 329.69 B: very normal people but um and my son said to me once he said gee you know it just sorta came to him he said do you know what if gramps hadn't spent all that money which my dad was just a complete spend thrift 

329.63 339.04 B: he just went through thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars his family h- was originally very well off and then my my grandmother was a widow and he just ran through all her money 

339.20 341.84 B: and my son said jeeze you know 

341.91 347.10 B: if gramps hadn't spent all that money then we'd have money wouldn't we you know like 

346.51 348.16 A: but i'm wondering did 

347.37 349.68 B: and i said to him do you know what 

348.21 349.84 A: did he spend it for good 

349.89 363.11 B: no not really i mean he spent it on his art work but he didn't really sort of do anything with it be different and i said well i said you know francis you got a point there but i said you know we would be very different i would be a different person 

353.53 355.20 A: no mhm 

363.36 374.99 B: i might not have had kids i might not have had you i said you know would my values because of of and that was a case where decisions were made not [laughter] not decisions in time that i made but decisions 

366.68 367.47 A: (( true )) 

375.04 378.86 B: that another person made that were in a lot of ways bad [laughter] 

379.15 386.38 B: you know from from the stand point of that they were imprudent and selfish but i said well you know the thing is is that 

379.17 380.28 A: well 

384.80 394.45 A: the th- you know a- and we we can go into a whole different thing what is selfish what is prudent and and whose definition is it you know [laughter] 

389.40 399.29 B: well he was definitely not prudent and not selfish and right now he is in very tough shape in a in the v._a. hospital so um 

396.55 397.91 A: (( [laughter] )) 

398.46 399.59 A: (( ah )) 

399.32 412.44 B: but i'm j- i was just more saying that you know sometimes that those decisions that seem negative in the long run are positive you know i said we're i'm a better person because probably i'm a better person because of that [noise] 

406.38 408.19 A: well you know i i'll tell you 

409.28 410.26 A: sure 

411.64 422.30 A: well you know y- you say this fella's in a- you're almost saying like ah because of of his past he's ah he's suffering retribution at this time is that is that 

421.17 428.78 B: oh i d- wouldn't say that i but wo- i wouldn't call it retribution i'd just say you know what as as one sows sows so you reap i mean 

428.94 441.67 B: he is it's a fact it is health i mean frankly he didn't take care of his health and he didn't have any money left o- you know what i mean i mean i'm not i'm not sort of even i i frankly don't think he was capable of 

429.11 431.86 A: it yeah what goes around comes around yeah 

439.04 440.19 A: so how would it 

441.10 449.41 A: how would it affect your life let's say it w- we we would just isolate everybody else and it's you and i and we s- and we were sitting and talking to each other and said 

449.66 464.28 A: if we went back in time what would we do and i think the question was what would we do differently to and i'll extend it a little bit to say th- to improve our life as it sits today 

464.23 468.89 A: what would you do to improve your life back twenty years ago 

469.49 472.55 A: to to to make your life better today 

472.98 474.77 B: that it it's so 

473.85 478.44 A: is that a question or what [laughter] 

475.38 480.59 B: yeah that's a question it is that is such a hard question 

478.87 487.58 A: oh it is i and i think that's the concept they wanted and that's a very difficult question you know i i'll tell ya my first marriage [lipsmack] 

487.83 493.04 A: is ah w- was not a disaster i ha- i have the most wonderful son 

493.14 503.58 A: in the entire world from it and i wouldn't change i would suffer that marriage again to have the same son so i couldn't say i wish i was more prudent as far as as 

503.41 515.05 A: the choice of women i can't say that because then i wouldn't have this son and i i i had a lot of ah entrepreneurial ah ah attitudes and things to do 

507.92 509.14 B: right right 

515.02 526.18 A: ah i think that's what i would i would be more prudent about i would be more cautious if you will because i'm as you can tell i speak loudly it's [laughter] i can't help it i'm sorry 

526.11 538.98 A: but it's i [mn] i i'm i'm an aggressive person and i just go out and and i really get burnt a lot but you know what i'm i'm i'm happy with myself and i i'm sh- you sound like a person that would be the same way 

526.13 526.98 B: yeah 

538.54 544.34 B: yeah i mean i c- i see what you mean i mean i've always been a person that took chances on friendships and um 

543.29 544.78 A: (( yeah [noise] [lipsmack] )) 

544.41 559.20 B: and i've made some fabulous friends like that and i've also gotten burned as well and ah but the thing is i wouldn't have the wonderful friends that i have if i hadn't been the way i was so you know i mean it's i i've looked back myself and thought 

554.76 556.33 A: exactly 

559.30 562.15 B: oh well that wasn't a good experience but 

560.51 562.31 A: what what is your name 

562.22 564.71 B: i'm elizabeth elizabeth nelson right 

563.07 568.81 A: elizabeth you know what i i think we wouldn't change a damn thing [laughter] 

566.55 575.84 B: well i just look i look back and and there are some things i might change because i look back and i think i wish i had been you know say more 

576.35 578.85 B: prudent or less fearful 

579.35 583.04 A: yeah you know i would've i wish i would've been more fearful ah 

579.40 580.41 B: you know 

581.03 595.61 B: and so there's more kind of for a negative it's more for something you know like ah i know i we have my husband and i have four wonderful children and ah we look back now and we think damn we should've started having kids a little you know w- you know what were we waiting for you know 

594.68 599.66 A: exactly this is what what i was tell- yeah [laughter] 

595.68 598.88 B: and and you look back and i think well in a lot of ways 

598.95 599.95 B: you know because
