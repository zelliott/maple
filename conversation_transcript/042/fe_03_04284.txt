37.47 38.53 B: (( did you say )) 

38.59 42.81 A: i went to college right outta high school if i had that to change i'd probably do something else 

42.96 44.63 A: before going to college 

44.70 47.24 B: ah go into the army or something you mean 

47.08 50.50 A: well [laughter] [mn] if it works out that ah i

55.09 56.12 B: yeah 

55.49 68.21 A: ah the first time and um i just hated school i was very tired of it very bored with it and i just never went to class and almost failed out decided yeah i'll drop out before i fail out [laughter] 

63.23 64.22 B: yeah 

67.89 68.80 B: yeah 

68.18 72.51 A: so i i told my dad one day i said hey dad i'm joining the army 

72.92 73.91 B: yeah 

72.97 75.49 A: after about twenty seconds he said what [laughter]

95.52 97.48 B: yeah 

96.03 104.11 A: oh then i got out and i came back to college after i break and i got my degree and everything was fine but yeah that's probably about the only thing i'd change 

105.51 112.05 B: no i graduated from college i probably would have gone directly into the army instead of going to law school
