2.06 3.32 A: (( hello )) 

3.40 6.37 B: hello uh yes hello can you hear me 

4.07 5.02 A: hello 

5.39 7.25 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] yes )) 

7.10 9.86 B: hi i'm alice how who are you

12.71 15.07 B: [sigh] hi sally how are you [sigh] 

14.23 15.96 A: i'm fine how are you 

15.62 20.03 B: okay um [sigh] do did you understand what the topic is [sigh] 

19.90 21.61 A: yes time travel 

21.61 27.74 B: okay and if you have the opportunity to go back in time and change something that you had done what would it be and why 

27.92 31.25 B: [sigh] okay do you want to go first or would you want me to go first 

30.79 34.25 A: (( [sigh] uh i can let you go first while i think [laughter] [laughter] )) 

33.64 40.65 B: okay uh i'm from by the way i'm from florida and i'm a school teacher [laughter] [sigh] um i live in hollywood and 

40.45 53.50 B: anyway you know i was thinking about this and i think i would have to go back about five or six years ago when i made this mistake that considerably changed my life uh as far as my financial situation 

53.64 59.86 B: so if i had the opportunity to go back in time and change something it would be to change [sigh] um 

59.90 72.42 B: like m- me like when i bought some stock i bought a lot of it you know with our family and we lost a lot of money [sigh] and because of that we're a lot poorer for it [laughter] [sigh] so how about yourself [sigh] [sigh] 

72.41 80.63 A: [sigh] uh i think i would probably go back in time and [mn] to when my children were little and spend a lot more time with them 

80.70 85.45 A: [sigh] and enjoy them while they're little because when they grow up to become teenagers 

85.73 89.50 A: (( [sigh] [mn] forget mum you know they're not ready for mum any more )) 

89.58 92.35 A: because um they feel they know it all 

92.76 101.45 A: [sigh] so i would probably do that and just because i'm i miss the closeness of when they were little and [sigh] and doing so much with 'em 

101.30 102.81 B: mhm 

101.55 102.67 A: (( and um [mn] )) 

102.71 106.98 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] yes well i guess this whole thing is about regret sally and 

106.85 107.53 B: (( [cough] )) 

107.36 111.69 B: [lipsmack] you know i also like i you know i wanted to add on my side that 

111.54 126.52 B: you know because uh when you you were talking about relationships like with your family and [sigh] even though i've never had any children i guess the reason i'd like to go back in time is because [sigh] and why i regretted this is because it's caused a lot of friction between the family [sigh] you know between 

126.42 132.14 B: among the family members because of the fact that [sigh] uh my husband and i did it together and it 

131.94 135.34 B: we we did it because of my [mn] m- my uh sis- my 

135.20 140.54 B: my husband's brother who'd found this great stock and he knew so much about the company and [sigh] and then 

140.51 152.96 B: you know we'd all bought so much they invested their whole lives into it but we didn't [sigh] we lost a lot of money and they lost everything [laughter] [sigh] and because of that you know even though we we can live our same lifestyle they can't 

152.84 167.63 B: you know then he lost his job and [sigh] you know it's caused a lot of friction and it all has to do with us buying the stock [laughter] [sigh] you know and um and and right now at this point you know for several months now you know like she hasn't spoken to me [sigh] [cough] you 

167.82 180.01 B: know i mean it happened five years ago but she's always bringing it up and at my face and if she sees me go on a trip [sigh] you know and all but [noise] and it's cost so much with the family and if i had never had bought that stock none of this would have happened [sigh] 

179.82 181.25 A: (( [noise] r- right )) 

181.10 183.89 B: so h- how about you [laughter] with yours [sigh] 

184.19 190.55 A: well [mn] mine is regret too but you know i think mine's just because [sigh] um 

190.79 191.86 A: i always 

192.38 199.66 A: i don't know i always felt that i should have spent more time with them [sigh] uh i guess because my father passed away recently 

199.41 200.62 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

199.77 208.34 A: and he was sick for a long time and i always wished that i had have spent more time with them [sigh] with him when he was alive because now i can't [noise] 

208.46 216.13 A: and you know [sigh] and i wish my children had spent more time with their grandfather [sigh] even though you know i know it's 

216.18 223.92 A: unrealistic but [laughter] you know i just wish that and [sigh] and that's probably what i would do if i could go back in time and change anything 

223.61 226.29 B: yes so like i know that you can't 

225.88 227.12 A: yeah 

226.27 239.54 B: right now but [sigh] like but one thing you can do is like do something maybe to [sigh] you know like do something else [sigh] you know for for your children that would take the place of [sigh] you know that regret 

239.39 240.30 A: (( uh-huh )) 

240.19 247.16 B: and uh like have you been like thinking of that or [sigh] you know like something something else that you can do for your children 

248.36 257.79 A: [sigh] um i i've been thinking about that uh i i guess because it's i mean when i say recent it's been like within the last three months so 

258.11 259.06 A: um 

259.76 270.21 A: and i and they're just getting older 'cause my oldest one's driving now and it's like good lord i remember when she was a baby and [sigh] i just can't believe that she's that old now 

270.09 272.64 B: mm h- h- how old is your o- your children 

270.92 271.68 A: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

272.29 274.35 A: [sigh] uh eleven [mn] 

274.52 276.39 A: fourteen and sixteen 

276.14 289.95 B: mhm [sigh] well i never you know i never had children s- so i can't identify with that although i have my students in school [laughter] [sigh] so like basically like our our regrets [laughter] are like quite different from one another 

290.09 291.50 B: (( [sigh] um )) 

291.08 292.28 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

291.57 292.95 B: (( [sigh] you know uh i )) 

292.88 303.57 B: like i guess there would be other things to but i i think we have to stick to just one thing and cha- and like they said like to change something that you had done [sigh] and [sigh] i don't know like i i guess what i 

299.93 301.28 A: yeah 

303.33 306.32 B: also what i would have done maybe is maybe 

306.08 314.06 B: if i wasn't so greedy and not had thought as much as i did you know you know people with their get rich quick schemes and i'm not the type that would that 

314.04 327.83 B: that likes to gamble a whole lot because i'm afraid to lose like a few bucks at the track [sigh] but this was something where we saw big opportunity and and then we regretted it because like somebody in the company stole all the money and took off with it and 

327.77 337.09 B: [sigh] um you know and we thought it was pretty safe but like nothing is safe so y- i think what you what people need to do is like really before you make a decision 

337.02 347.90 B: so you don't have these regrets is to really think things out carefully and [sigh] before you do decide you know make a decision what you're going to do [sigh] you know you have to be more careful [sigh] mhm 

348.08 359.27 A: yeah the i you know my husband he's great for that [sigh] but yes i i know what you're talking about there [sigh] because my husband h- has done things [mn] you know like these um [lipsmack] [sigh] 

359.77 372.09 A: selling things you know you see in the newspaper all the time about being a becoming a post office person and it's just one of them rich get rich quick schemes and [sigh] and and all it is is you wind up paying money out and you never use it to 

372.09 381.79 A: [sigh] i i mean i haven't lost as much as you and your husband but [sigh] uh i have um put money into things like that mainly for my husband and then [sigh] nothing ever comes of it 

372.15 373.28 B: mhm 

381.97 385.25 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] well just let this be a lesson to you 

382.18 382.74 A: (( [sigh] )) 

385.25 399.88 B: so you won't be thinking like me that you have to go back in time and change that [laughter] but just just be very careful with your investments because like i guess from our mistakes like we do we learn things in life and i'll tell you this was a very expensive 

399.66 406.86 B: mistake that i had made and [sigh] one that i hope never will never happen again so [sigh] n- now because of this 

406.70 418.67 B: you know i i watch where i put my money i'm i'm more conservative because i'm look i'm i'm probably older than you are because i'm looking to retire maybe in a bout five six seven years i i've been teaching fro thirty three years [sigh] so you know i 

418.66 422.96 B: so that now that i won't have that i won't have these regrets any more i 

422.91 428.76 B: [sigh] i know i'm going to be more careful with my with my money it's taught me like a really big lesson [laughter] [sigh] 

427.96 429.42 A: (( you know yeah )) 

428.72 434.93 B: an um it's funny 'cause i saw this like time travel and i'm i'm doing the time machine with my students 

434.83 445.72 B: [laughter] so i thought it was going to be a question like that that cau- kinda caught me off track [sigh] but i did think of this because this has been something that's been on my mind like so much 

435.31 436.88 A: (( oh well that's good [laughter] [sigh] )) 

445.41 446.54 A: yeah 

445.56 454.63 B: [sigh] and i i just hope that there will be some something with our family where like things will be more cohesive more cohesive with us [sigh] 

454.57 455.44 A: mm

512.17 522.10 B: you know like um [mn] they need some kind of a [sigh] you know like a family a good family environment to prepare them for the future [sigh] and like m- me being a teacher 

522.19 530.09 B: [lipsmack] you know like we we feel that family is very important more so than the school because with the families that's the 

530.26 540.54 B: [sigh] you know what the the family is what really it like makes a mark on the on the kid and how the family handle like problems and and things like that [sigh]
