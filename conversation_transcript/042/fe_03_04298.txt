11.88 13.84 A: oh sorry jerry sorry jerry 

13.58 15.98 B: that's minor are you aware of the topic 

16.38 20.17 A: yeah seems a little personal but 

19.57 24.61 B: yeah yeah but i guess you have to make it not too personal you know 

24.41 25.79 A: sure 

25.19 27.72 B: um but um 

28.28 30.85 B: i don't know i guess in thinking about it 

31.68 36.64 B: ah without being too personal you know [laughter] i would probably say um 

37.35 46.29 B: i when i was married i i i probably say if i could go back in time i would change that when i was divorced um because um it 

47.20 50.20 B: precluded or prevented me from 

50.26 53.23 B: having the kind of relationship with my children which 

53.60 54.61 B: i 

54.86 55.96 B: you know 

56.47 58.23 B: would have liked to have had 

57.65 59.10 A: right 

58.42 62.86 B: and so i think you know now that i'm older 

63.26 67.31 B: and actually it wasn't just a matter of being older it it seems that that was 

67.45 74.97 B: to me probably the most devastating thing that ever happened to me and if i if i could have changed it i would have i would have liked to 

72.18 74.04 A: really 

74.59 75.28 A: (( mm )) 

77.55 78.77 A: um 

79.48 81.44 A: [sigh] i guess the first thing 

82.41 87.67 A: ah i would think i would be if i could go back i would this 

87.88 90.32 A: as a hypothetical i would i would like to finish 

91.21 97.41 A: school i guess i would say i i kinda i never finished i never got my degree in college 

97.52 101.49 A: but ah i suppose that ah that is something that's 

101.55 103.86 A: that i could a ah 

104.01 112.85 A: achieve if i just motivated myself in in the in the right areas it's it's something 

112.94 115.58 A: i dealt with for a long time 

115.74 125.56 A: ah i just i i never knew how i felt about school i i had was never very career minded or had any kind of aspirations as far as 

125.79 133.72 A: working and things like that and i really was just going to school for my parents because it's it's it seemed to me what they expected me to do 

134.39 141.08 A: but [laughter] i guess when when you're younger m- more of the time you seem at least for me it seems you do a lot of things 

141.75 144.67 A: you do in your life just seem to be to 

145.03 148.35 A: what what your what your what your family and what your loved ones 

148.62 149.97 A: expect from you 

150.41 151.49 A: but as you 

151.97 153.18 A: get older 

153.88 156.50 A: it becomes less a little bit 

156.60 162.26 A: less of a concern but ah at the same time i would i would like to go back and do it finish it for myself 

162.06 163.92 B: i'm fifty four how old are you 

164.09 166.94 A: i'm only twenty five 

166.37 171.67 B: oh gosh oh man come [laughter] [laughter] 

167.08 170.60 A: (( so i i got plenty of time you know i )) 

170.84 172.55 A: at the same time i 

172.05 173.72 B: (( [laughter] )) 

172.95 178.95 A: i'm i'm too i'm a little bit much of the the quintessential slacker 

179.54 183.06 A: work a couple part time jobs ah 

183.61 189.65 A: i rent my home with a couple other quintessential slackers 

189.86 190.96 A: um 

192.04 198.68 A: but it's it's not to say that there aren't bigger and better things i guess the whole 

198.92 206.00 A: [sigh] going back in time going back in time i mean i i if i went [noise] further i could go back to before 

206.35 208.21 A: i i maybe i 

208.66 218.01 A: would pay more attention to my studies at an earlier age but education was an issue with me from 

218.18 219.60 A: really early on 

220.13 227.74 A: that as far as i can remember i just just various aspects of the institution and the mechanics of it the the politics 

228.38 234.91 A: ah the bureaucracy ah all you notice it all all the way from kindergarten through 

235.43 241.67 A: if you ever make it to the university it's it's kind of the same story i'm sure you you you seem like an educated guy 

241.81 246.56 B: [laughter] well i i've finished yeah i'm a school teacher to be exact but um [cough] 

246.90 249.19 B: you know i think at twenty five um 

249.59 253.97 B: i remember i used to smoke like um 'bout a pack and a half of cigarettes a day 

253.74 254.51 A: (( mm )) 

254.67 262.48 B: and it was at the thought occurred to me that this was really not something i wanted to do but there i was doing it 

262.57 276.21 B: and i knew that i wanted to stop but or even after i decided that i really wanted to stop doing that i still found myself found myself doing it for a while and then one day 

270.39 271.07 A: mm 

276.46 286.58 B: i just kinda i had a thought and and i was able to stop smoking cold turkey and i i probably haven't smoked for maybe twenty twenty five years 

282.70 284.84 A: that's good 

286.12 287.08 A: wow 

286.75 287.85 B: um 

288.48 294.44 B: and and actually drinking was the same way not that i'd ever drank much according to my father but still 

294.62 298.07 B: i drank a lot to me the point i'm trying to make 

298.15 300.20 B: is though that um 

300.64 302.70 B: you know the fact that it's 

302.81 304.40 B: something that's 

304.94 308.91 B: or sounds like it's important in your mind um 

308.92 313.02 B: means that you know you really oughta consider following up on it um 

313.59 320.82 B: you know [cough] i didn't go back to college in fact until i was twenty seven um i was married young and um 

317.09 317.90 A: (( mm )) 

321.75 324.77 B: ah had three children by the time i was twenty two 

325.55 329.34 B: that's all the children i ever had and um i'm happy that i 

327.44 329.32 A: mhm 

329.36 331.17 B: you know had those children 

330.65 331.29 A: [cough] 

331.44 340.26 B: but my point is that i didn't return to college until i was um about twenty seven i went back to a junior college for several years and then 

340.27 346.95 B: i went to the university of california at berkley and um you know i've done a lot of coursework since then 

346.80 347.99 A: mhm 

347.07 349.59 B: but um at twenty five you're 

349.85 357.32 B: [cough] you know don't ah if you know if you're sincere don't get on yourself too tough the main thing is just to 

357.63 369.65 B: i think it's a i think it's a sound idea ah particularly in these times and um and it is something that in fact you can actually go back in in time and change you know 

368.94 373.46 A: yeah that's why my answer was kind of a half of a cop out i didn't want to go i 

369.82 371.53 B: ah [laughter] 

371.74 374.26 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

373.57 380.04 A: didn't want to go with it but i didn't wanna i didn't wanna dredge up anything unpleasant from the closet though 

380.32 386.39 A: either [sigh] ah i mean if it maybe if going back to when i was really younger i i i guess maybe i i 

386.41 393.81 A: could have or should have paid attention to my father more and then maybe and maybe taken a lesson from him 

394.12 395.34 A: he's 

396.14 402.25 A: he's he's very intelligent but not in academic way 

402.88 404.90 A: he's very hands on 

405.37 406.72 A: um 

406.96 408.78 A: ah mechanical 

409.05 415.32 A: minded but in in that in that regard i consider him a genius and and i just never felt i could ever 

416.02 422.47 A: live up to what he was capable of doing ah you know w- with his with his hands or with ah 

422.50 425.90 A: if he would build or construct or repair something 

426.16 431.15 A: so i you know i i what about what was i gonna be i was gonna be the first person in our family to 

431.44 435.17 A: to even to go to to attend college other than his brother 

435.07 435.97 B: i see 

435.41 444.93 A: i think and and it just i it would seem like it was a big deal it it was mentioned a lot it was harped on it's it's all they talked to you about in high school was 

436.26 436.83 B: (( [cough] )) 

445.23 455.55 A: is like ah everybody's going to college and everyone who's not is going to be working at mickey d's for the next fifteen years which is just isn't the case but they 

455.69 456.84 A: they kinda 

457.57 468.22 A: pushed that scenario as being reality that college is the only answer and and what's the reality of that fifty percent of all college freshmen drop out before 

468.66 470.69 A: ah the four years 

471.05 475.48 A: fifty percent of all all all new freshmen will never get the degree 

475.21 476.26 B: interesting 

475.63 479.33 A: you know ah i think i think the statistic goes something like that 

480.17 494.56 A: you know it i i i i work in a university atmosphere actually right now i work at a bookstore it's a privately owned and operated bookstore operates outside of the confines of the university and 

492.44 495.27 B: where are you at what ah state are you from

582.06 584.08 B: our own parents are 

583.93 584.72 A: mm
