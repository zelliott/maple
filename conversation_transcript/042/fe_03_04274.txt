0.36 1.50 A: (( [lipsmack] hello )) 

1.01 2.07 B: hi 

1.86 3.42 A: hey how's it going 

2.79 3.87 B: good how are you 

3.50 4.87 A: good i'm scott 

4.58 5.69 B: i'm kevin 

5.21 9.01 A: hey kevin how's it going [sigh] um so time travel huh 

6.92 7.82 B: (( pretty good )) 

9.04 13.62 B: [sigh] yeah so if you could go back in time and change something what what would you change [sigh] 

13.16 16.46 A: [noise] something that i did was the question or anything 

15.97 18.16 B: i think it was something that you did [sigh] 

17.30 26.05 A: [sigh] um if i could go back and change something that i did [sigh] let me see [sigh] 

26.81 30.88 A: (( um i don't know what do you think [noise] )) 

30.97 35.90 B: well it's kind of funny 'cause i i have this conversation with my wife occasionally and 

33.16 33.76 A: (( [noise] )) 

35.05 37.24 A: [noise] [noise] do you really 

36.14 40.00 B: [sigh] well not not exactly but you know like um 

40.41 49.29 B: [lipsmack] would change something if you could and [sigh] i don't think you should i think [sigh] i wouldn't change anything that i've done [sigh] just because i think that all those things [sigh] 

40.60 41.56 A: (( [noise] )) 

42.84 43.86 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

48.89 50.95 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

49.78 51.53 B: add up to be [sigh] 

51.52 64.12 B: where you're at and you never know [sigh] what effect [sigh] changing something before could have now [sigh] you know i mean something negative [sigh] because just uh just because it seems like you could go back and 

54.41 56.30 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

57.07 58.47 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

60.70 62.28 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

64.06 74.49 B: [sigh] you know save some money that you wasted or something it doesn't mean that you wouldn't have [sigh] wasted it on something far worse and [sigh] gotten into worse of a jam because of it you know 

65.76 68.21 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

73.39 84.00 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah that's true that's [noise] actually that's a good way to look at it i don't know there may [noise] there may maybe like something like something bad [noise] you did you might change though if there was no value [noise] at all [sigh] 

84.05 92.12 A: like maybe i think if i was going to [noise] go change something [sigh] the worse thing i ever [noise] did was i took money from my student counsel when i was in high school and used it for a party 

91.87 93.02 B: [laughter] oh yeah 

91.96 99.28 A: [sigh] and i've always felt a little guilty about that [sigh] so maybe i would go back and uh [noise] and not do that i'd turn in the money 

98.54 99.80 B: yeah 

99.55 104.28 A: [sigh] so maybe that would be the one thing 'cause i you know that's probably not something that uh 

104.60 110.17 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] probably added to any character that i that i've been building [noise] in my life so [sigh] [noise] 

109.45 117.83 B: really you don't think that maybe doing that on a small scale and [sigh] maybe by the way that you felt about it didn't [sigh] 

111.74 113.10 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] )) 

118.01 119.10 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

119.85 131.15 B: you know maybe preven- prevent you from doing something worse in the future you know i mean noth- nothing about your character but you know maybe you [sigh] you do something on a small scale and then say wow that really made me feel bad and 

130.52 134.78 A: [sigh] yeah you know that's a good point actually yeah that that could that could be valid [sigh] 

134.33 139.43 B: you know somebody maybe does their first thing on a larger scale and uh 

137.47 150.04 A: yeah before they realize that that's you know not the way to to act [sigh] [sigh] hey y- you never [noise] know actually [noise] [sigh] in the long run the the party was pretty harmless and a and a pretty good time so [sigh] 

141.01 141.91 B: right 

142.92 143.75 B: right 

149.15 150.16 B: right 

150.28 158.42 B: yeah i don't know i mean i've done things that i definitely [sigh] wish at the time that i hadn't done [laughter] you know but [sigh] um 

151.80 152.50 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

154.93 157.38 A: mhm 

158.81 165.61 B: i still don't think that the chance that you would take by changing it [sigh] would be worse 

166.11 168.93 B: the potential problems you could cause by that you know 

168.68 174.44 A: [noise] [noise] yeah now that's a good point i i i think i agree with you in in it for the most part on that [noise] 

173.86 186.06 B: [mn] it was funny i read a story one time about [sigh] this um these people who could go back in time they had these trips and there was like a travel agency or a guide service and you could go back in time and kill a dinosaur 

176.85 178.55 A: (( [noise] [sigh] [noise] )) 

179.67 181.37 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

186.11 189.10 A: to kill a dinosaur uh-huh [noise] 

187.17 198.43 B: yeah so but the one they had built this magical path that floated off the off the ground and [sigh] how it actually worked was that the dinosaur was about to die in like five minutes 

197.58 199.18 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

198.57 206.37 B: and so you could shoot it and get that thrill but you really weren't altering the course of history by much [sigh] 

205.55 209.07 A: [noise] because it was going to happen anyway [noise] okay 

207.55 213.90 B: right and so part of the whole rules was that you couldn't step off the path because you'd never how anything would affect [sigh] 

210.92 213.91 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

213.98 222.20 B: you later in life and so [sigh] one guy he decides to ignore the rules and he steps off the path and he crunches this butterfly 

216.29 217.55 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

221.52 223.48 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

222.68 232.96 B: and so he goes back to the future um to his time and there's nazis on every corner [sigh] of his town 

232.66 234.36 A: [noise] really 

233.68 247.21 B: [lipsmack] yeah and so [sigh] he he just fundamentally changed the whole course of history by altering when this butterfly was supposed to die and it lead to this whole other series of events that [sigh] no one could have anticipated 

241.22 243.05 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] huh [noise] [noise] )) 

246.08 248.36 A: [noise] wow that's pretty crazy 

248.26 252.45 B: yeah and it was like a kid's book and i mean i remember reading it when i was probably in junior high and 

251.82 252.97 A: uh-huh 

252.56 253.82 B: (( [sigh] um )) 

254.15 255.64 B: it just always 

255.82 258.37 B: made me think about those things in a different way 

258.00 266.72 A: [noise] yeah that's pretty interesting [noise] [sigh] what about if uh if you could time travel back to any era in history where would you go to 

269.00 270.64 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah i don't know )) 

269.30 270.27 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

271.30 275.28 B: i i mean i've thought about that one too and i i i'm actually not sure 

275.37 278.63 B: [sigh] there's lot there's lots of times that i think would be interesting 

277.97 286.20 A: [noise] [noise] yeah there i think uh [noise] personally i think i've thought about this before too i i think roman [noise] times would be fun to to live in 

286.46 288.42 B: yeah i do too 

287.30 291.07 A: i i i mean as long as you're like uh you know 

291.14 292.27 B: [laughter] 

291.25 298.16 A: in the in the upper class of of the roman uh the roman life i think [sigh] that would be pretty cool to check out 

292.64 293.38 B: (( yeah as )) 

297.42 299.36 B: long as your not a plebe huh 

298.16 302.10 A: [noise] yeah exactly [noise] as long as you're part of the patricians 

300.32 302.53 B: yeah i think that would be pretty interesting too 

302.02 315.73 A: [sigh] yeah i think that would be pretty good to see their the parties and entertainment and [sigh] and the [noise] society and you know [noise] it's probably [noise] it was probably pretty good to be at the [noise] most dominant progressive society in the in the world [noise] so [noise] 

315.05 320.08 B: yeah [sigh] yeah i think that would be interesting i would also kind of like to um 

321.08 324.58 B: go back and just see simple things like i live in colorado 

321.89 323.60 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

324.13 325.19 A: uh-huh 

324.59 332.59 B: and i would like to see you know maybe in the seventeen hundreds what this place looked like you know 'cause i i love the outdoors and i'd like to really see [sigh] 

328.69 330.21 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

332.61 336.63 B: sort of the unspoiled version of what we get now you know 

334.03 334.59 A: (( [sigh] )) 

336.27 337.65 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

337.02 343.89 B: because we've altered everything so much that [sigh] it's hard to imagine what it was like before there was so much settlement 

342.66 346.96 A: [noise] [sigh] yeah that's a good point and uh probably a lot more buffalo 

346.85 349.71 B: yeah [laughter] a lot more of everything i think 

347.88 350.95 A: [laughter] yeah 

350.07 357.87 B: [sigh] so yeah i that's that's probably the first thing i would do is is go back and just see the west when it was untamed 

355.76 361.85 A: [noise] yeah that's really cool i yeah i mean it's the west is almost like even today it's sort of like uh 

362.42 363.44 A: uh 

363.66 369.17 A: like almost like a view of like unspoiled land compared to the east coast so you know 

368.88 370.23 B: [sigh] oh yeah 

369.64 377.29 A: like if you you know if you go out there i i live in d._c. and you know d- driving between here and new york is just disgusting like [sigh] 

377.11 387.04 A: everything's developed you go through new jersey and delaware and it's like [sigh] there's not an inch of land that hasn't been touched but when you go west there's a lot more space it seems like it's a little bit more preserved 

386.36 397.35 B: yeah [sigh] and it's funny 'cause that's probably the second time i would go back is to the [sigh] revolutionary period 'cause i spent some time there too in alexandria and monticello and stuff so 

394.79 396.44 A: [noise] okay 

396.88 398.51 A: oh that's cool 

397.71 400.75 B: i'd really love that that point in our history too 

398.95 402.60 A: yeah there's a lot of i mean in that there's a lot of good history around here 

403.20 405.66 A: for that so where in uh where in colorado are you 

405.84 407.29 B: fort collins 

406.73 408.56 A: oh fort collins okay 

407.80 409.16 B: north of denver 

408.97 415.62 A: now see i've an uncle actually who are [sigh] has lived in colorado for a long time i think he's moving to washington but uh 

415.56 424.42 A: he lived in steamboat springs and durango and uh [lipsmack] [sigh] denver for a while and we visited him in uh boulder when he was there too 

424.55 425.74 B: (( oh yeah )) 

425.02 427.42 A: that's pret- so that's pretty cool 

426.79 428.75 B: where do you live out by d._c. 

428.11 436.09 A: [sigh] uh i actually live downtown uh we used to live in roslyn and uh we moved down um [noise] 

436.35 442.33 A: [sigh] to uh it's sort of like by the m._c._i. center downtown like near capital hill kind of 

439.33 440.28 B: oh yeah 

441.95 443.20 B: yeah 

442.96 456.66 A: so yeah it's pretty good so d._c. there's a good like since the m._c._i. centre has come in there's been a lot more stuff around here so it's been pretty nice a lot more restaurants and [sigh] bars and there's a couple of new con- condo buildings being built so there'll be more people down here 

456.38 459.76 B: yeah yeah i spent a lot of time down there actually 

457.22 460.32 A: oh that's pretty good [noise] oh really [noise] 

459.81 462.41 B: yeah i love to i love to go down there so 

462.83 466.45 B: i just ride the metro down and walked around and 

465.75 479.85 A: [noise] yeah yeah it's pretty nice that way i mean it's kind of cool uh that everything like all the museums are free 'cause you can [noise] if you have like an hour you can just [noise] kind of cruise around and [sigh] you know you're not really investing that much you can go in and look at one thing in the museum and leave so it's pretty nice [noise] 

479.32 484.47 B: yeah [sigh] yeah uh that's it's probably my favorite place i've ever been actually so 

484.04 489.16 A: oh really [noise] yeah it's it's it's pretty cool colorado's pretty c- sweet place though too 

484.84 485.98 B: yeah

490.07 491.88 A: yeah 

491.00 494.05 B: there's a lot of uh a lot of great things to do [sigh]

499.96 502.00 B: uh this is the second call 

501.39 503.42 A: [sigh] second call 

502.56 503.73 B: (( yeah how 'bout you [sigh] )) 

503.49 515.33 A: yeah this is my well [noise] i think it's my fourth but i thought it was only supposed to be three so i don't really know although i had one where i picked it up and when i connected there was nobody there so maybe that doesn't count 

514.82 516.89 B: oh right 

516.34 517.91 A: um but i don't know 

518.83 521.19 B: [sigh] yeah it's a pretty fun 

521.59 522.99 B: easy thing to do 

522.63 526.21 A: [sigh] [sigh] yeah i mean hey ten minutes for ten bucks it's 

526.66 528.35 A: pretty painless you know 

528.14 529.92 B: yeah 

529.41 538.48 A: and uh apparently it's i don't know if how if they decide but [sigh] i think they limit you to three and less but some people can do like twenty five or thirty 

538.75 542.73 A: so you figure yeah that's what i was reading on uh one of the emails they sent out [sigh] 

538.88 539.81 B: really 

542.81 550.42 A: so i mean that's like two hundred and fifty bucks right there for like you know a couple weeks work that's pretty good yeah i'll take that 

547.32 548.76 B: (( yeah that's not bad at all )) 

550.40 556.26 B: yeah i know my um my brother-in-law's from haiti and so you know they keep calling him because they want 

558.04 560.06 B: to t- test sort of his 

560.40 562.29 B: pigeon english you know yeah 

561.75 563.74 A: oh really 

563.86 570.69 A: it so what's the deal are they are they i don't understand the relation to language that the study is is about 

564.44 566.89 B: i mean i imagine i don't know if that's true but 

570.96 578.15 B: well i think they want to determine they they're they're using they're trying to develop speech recognition software i think 

577.08 579.75 A: [noise] oh is that it okay ah 

578.98 586.28 B: and so they want to make sure that all different types of speech by people in different parts of the country can be recognized 

584.93 588.13 A: i see okay 

588.70 594.48 B: so they want to gauge the how people from different parts of the country speak and 

595.07 596.27 B: the uh [lipsmack] 

596.65 598.66 B: different types of accents and 

598.28 599.65 A: oh okay
