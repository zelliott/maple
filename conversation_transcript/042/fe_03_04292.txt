161.05 162.06 A: yeah 

166.02 174.78 B: change who i married or anything but just just do it different ah so i don't think that would necessary change the future but um 

169.09 170.06 A: uh-huh 

174.87 176.40 B: you know that would be something 

175.03 177.31 A: why you don't know i mean there's people 

176.62 178.50 B: it might have i don't know 

178.00 188.12 A: yeah there's people that ah that were at i've been married for this is actually my third marriage and and i wouldn't chan- even though the other two didn't work out 

187.96 188.89 B: yeah 

188.30 201.02 A: they really did get me ready for this one and and it and yeah and it wouldn't i wouldn't have been in a position to appreciate my wife the way i do [sigh] if [sigh] it would have been a different ah 

191.48 193.09 B: well that's good 

201.23 206.34 A: ah different scenario i mean i learned i learned so much about life and 

206.61 217.74 A: what i don't want people to feel like and her- just all kinds of stuff even though they weren't all positive lessons i i really look at those marriages as preparing me for the one that really counts in my life and 

217.01 223.22 B: yeah no one that mat- matters you know and that that it yeah that's true i mean i 

217.84 218.60 A: and it

240.28 246.80 A: you know so i think if you were to go back and change something about your wedding it could it really could affect other people's lives 

246.79 257.45 B: well that could have yeah you know yeah it might that's true i mean i i never thought about it that way i'm thinking you know just a flower here and there might [laughter] [laughter] [laughter]

263.86 264.82 A: [laughter] 

265.78 267.63 A: [laughter] 

270.59 281.24 B: you know that that's interesting i mean the whole thought i mean i know there's times when you think oh i'd just love to just go back and change that one thing or that [sigh] but 

281.66 292.28 B: i don't know i mean you can't imagine your life being any different now than what it is was you know or what it what it could be or whatever i mean that just is [sigh] 

285.32 286.22 A: yeah 

292.14 296.82 B: that's a interesting interesting topic [laughter] 

294.93 299.47 A: it is well i i like science fiction and i and i like ah 

299.71 306.37 A: [sigh] you know if the question comes up if you could go back in time and kill hitler's mother would you do it [sigh] 

306.75 308.47 B: oh hm 

308.63 311.43 B: i don't know about that i i you know 

311.49 325.43 B: there was there is one thing that i've always um i don't think i i don't think i could because see that would change the course of history [sigh] even even though you know you you'd think oh yeah i'd love to but um 

319.79 320.74 A: yeah 

326.01 336.68 B: well it's kinda like um i don't know if you've been if you were watching the news lately but have you see the news with the lady that killed her two little boys in 

336.76 338.00 B: texas 

338.35 340.30 A: is that a recent thing 

339.64 342.79 B: yeah it's just happened this weekend 

341.18 347.41 A: no i haven't seen it but i remember it an identical thing somebody named smith did it five or six years ago 

346.73 352.59 B: yeah and then andrea yates you know drowned her five children you know um in 

350.73 351.75 A: yeah 

352.48 364.76 B: just a couple years ago [sigh] but this girl you know my family knows well but she um you'll you'll see it on the news it's on all the headlines but she lives right down the road from us and 

363.56 365.14 A: is that right 

364.82 378.96 B: yeah and she bludgeoned her two oldest sons um to death and a third one she tried and i don't know if she just snapped or what i mean we don't know what's going on yet but [sigh] um it's pretty horrible with rocks [laughter] 

368.93 370.37 A: (( oh my god )) 

376.91 377.95 A: you [sigh] 

377.98 383.96 A: i bet you're hoping it's not something in the water [laughter] [laughter] 

380.12 393.80 B: no [laughter] ooh lord i know all these people from texas all like these mothers i'm like good grief they're gonna think texas women are nuts but you know things like that you you wish somehow you could go you know go back in time and maybe 

393.86 404.96 B: change you know like when you said that about hitler you know i i think about like her and her husband was asleep when all this was happening and he didn't even know you know you know you just 

395.25 396.28 A: uh-huh 

402.22 403.51 A: (( oh my god )) 

404.89 413.46 B: wish for that sake you could go and say wake up you know go you know get your kids outta here for a few minutes or so i mean anything 

408.28 409.31 A: yeah 

413.48 417.31 B: you know i there was there's one incident that i um 

413.50 414.37 A: yeah 

417.93 428.11 B: always thought if i could ever have gone back in time i went to west rose high school but it was new london high school in back in nineteen thirty seven 

428.30 433.83 B: it exploded and um killed three hundred and sixty five children about five minutes 

432.70 435.07 A: oh my god you're kidding 

433.89 446.18 B: yeah about five yeah about five minutes before the school was to let out and um it was at that time new london was the richest school in the world because it was full sitting on a oil field 

445.74 446.70 A: uh-huh 

446.25 450.22 B: and um ah it was one of the richest areas 

450.45 452.50 B: and [sigh] you know 

452.43 457.94 B: for that to have happened that's the reason why we have a smelling gas natural gas now 

457.67 458.83 A: oh 

457.86 471.45 B: because it had been piped in illegally underneath the school the superintendent had done that to save money and pockets of it had filled up and a spark shot you know and it blew up it just blew everything up it was horrible 

468.51 470.06 A: oh my goodness 

471.32 483.89 B: it was one of the worst school disasters in history but for me growing up and going to that school that was one thing i've done lots of papers on it and things and i used to think boy i tell ya i would love to just 

483.80 489.40 B: have been able to go back in time and get all those kids out you know of that school 

487.45 493.59 A: course if you did that then maybe maybe that's where your parents went to school and they would have never met or something and 

493.01 504.88 B: see that's that's exactly it i mean that would have changed the course i mean new london was growing so much now it's only got like nine nine hundred people i mean it's very small but it was 

493.99 494.94 A: yeah 

495.02 496.12 A: you don't know 

504.27 505.19 A: uh-huh 

504.76 518.79 B: growing to probably be huge it was going to be huge and when you at adolf hitler he actually sent a condolence letter to um our school and said how sorry he was [sigh] it's in the smiths 

508.32 509.15 A: uh-huh 

517.71 519.41 A: is that right 

518.81 529.79 B: yeah it's in the smithsonian now but um in that weird [laughter] yeah i mean he didn't care about lives but he sends you know a a letter saying giving his condolences 

523.59 524.59 A: yeah 

528.45 531.59 A: i guess it was the politically correct thing to do 

531.35 542.16 B: i guess so but you're right i mean that would have changed i mean so many people lost their children and stuff and that that they all left and so you know our town 

542.35 545.81 B: that little new london town was just um 

545.87 548.08 A: [sigh] unalterably changed 

546.45 547.69 B: you know it's gone down 

547.68 557.53 B: it was alterly- changed i mean it but i always wanted to just warn those kids i always thought if i could just that's one thing if i could go back in time and do you know 

557.47 568.09 B: but you're right it would have it would have changed history i mean completely we wouldn't probably have a smelling gas unless you know later on down the line something like that happened and 

568.11 569.82 B: now people you know 

568.19 572.16 A: yeah it would have been another catastrophe that would have caused it you know 

570.52 578.16 B: well that's exactly it so you wonder why things you know you wonder why things happen and i think that 

578.22 587.78 B: you know i hate that children had to [sigh] die for that sake but that um is probably the reason so it could save you know so many more lives 

587.66 588.74 A: i hear ya 

587.89 594.33 B: but um but that's that that's always been one that's always on my mind about going back and changing 

594.46 595.75 B: and 

594.49 597.26 A: have you ever heard of a movie called millennium [sigh] 

597.15 598.36 B: (( [lipsmack] millennium )) 

598.58 599.65 A: uh-huh
