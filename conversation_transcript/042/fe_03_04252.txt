9.58 11.97 A: right so what is our topic i couldn't hear him 

11.34 21.95 B: uh the topic is if we could go back in time and change one thing [sigh] what would it be and why [laughter] [sigh] you mean only one [laughter] 

16.95 17.84 A: (( uh )) 

19.18 20.42 A: um 

21.25 24.11 A: yeah jeeze [lipsmack] uh 

24.62 27.00 A: well i don't know what would you change 

26.37 41.36 B: [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] well [sigh] i've just been sitting here thinking one of the uh which one of the uh [noise] many things would i [laughter] would i change [sigh] um [lipsmack] i would probably [sigh] good grief 

41.92 45.43 B: i'd kind of make it a habit habit to not 

45.45 54.26 B: get caught up in that [laughter] 'cause you can't ever change anything so i don't really [sigh] i don't really sit and think well gosh if i could go back and do that again 

46.97 49.00 A: (( [laughter] that's good )) 

49.01 50.57 A: you can't do it so 

54.17 55.21 A: yeah 

54.47 57.75 B: (( [sigh] um [lipsmack] i don't know have you thought of anything [laughter] )) 

57.58 59.78 A: uh i'd never let my friends cut my hair 

59.86 65.63 B: oh there you go [laughter] well i was going to say if that's a minor [sigh] minor that's pretty minor 

61.61 62.62 A: (( yeah )) 

63.88 64.44 A: (( [cough] )) 

65.25 71.70 A: (( pretty minor i don't think there's anything major [noise] i would go back [noise] and uh [noise] i don't know [noise] hard to say )) 

71.46 81.60 B: right [sigh] um i would probably change where [noise] i went to [noise] school [noise] because i think that [noise] 

72.50 73.50 A: (( um )) 

79.21 82.75 A: (( yeah )) 

81.59 91.13 B: in the end i i went to a pretty [noise] good school as it was [noise] but it wasn't really where i wanted to be [sigh] and after i was done uh 

91.07 99.68 B: i i went there to play college sports but i didn't play my entire uh four years [sigh] and uh i went to b._y._u. 

95.84 96.78 A: (( okay )) 

96.91 97.96 A: (( where did you go )) 

100.06 112.20 B: in utah and so if i but i was raised in austin and so i really wanted to go to the university of texas but they did not have men's volleyball which is what i [noise] ended up playing 

112.15 113.03 A: ah 

112.51 124.76 B: [sigh] so after i was done playing [noise] i i should have transferred which is what i wanted to do but never did and i think it uh [noise] i would have been a little happier [laughter] and wouldn't have 

119.43 120.47 A: (( uh-huh ah )) 

123.33 127.85 A: [laughter] see i i wanted to go somewhere [laughter] 

124.94 128.51 B: i wouldn't have left with the resentment that i had so 

127.96 129.88 A: yeah i didn't have any resentment i 

129.92 135.58 A: you know [noise] but i didn't really initially want to go where i ended up going and then in retrospect i decided that was a great place to go 

135.36 136.93 B: oh really where did you go 

136.70 139.05 A: [noise] the university of vermont 

137.90 138.86 B: uh-huh 

139.12 140.41 A: (( so [laughter] )) 

139.92 148.91 B: yeah so i just uh i k- i kind of left with a bad taste in my mouth and i didn't want to but i did and it's still and it's lasted me now for [sigh] 

148.97 156.44 B: you know ten years eight to ten years oh [laughter] and so it's eh [laughter] 

151.01 152.87 A: [laughter] 

155.48 158.77 A: yeah if only i know what you mean i mean i might have had like a 

158.88 165.91 A: maybe more of a focus maybe i don't know if i could go back and just sort of like slap myself in the head man you should uh 

165.92 169.04 A: have some idea what you're doing once you get out 

169.19 180.67 B: yeah you know i thought about that and it's so hard because you get up there and [sigh] you know for i mean you get to school and for a lot of times it's your first time away from home or close to it 

169.27 170.48 A: yeah 

180.58 181.45 A: yeah 

180.65 189.74 B: and so i i you know i've thought oh you know would i have done this better would i have done that better or what you know but [sigh] i don't know it's 

188.76 191.69 A: yeah there's no really there's no way to say you know 

191.47 192.90 B: (( right )) 

192.30 194.85 A: who knows that's the thing 

194.16 196.91 B: right yep 

195.46 202.32 A: so i mean who knows if i'd have been better off if i hadn't gone snowboarding for three years after i went to school you know [laughter] 

200.22 204.25 B: [laughter] oh yeah [sigh] um 

203.21 207.09 A: but in retrospect that was so much fun like i wouldn't give that up for the world 

206.58 207.83 B: right [sigh] 

207.67 208.70 A: so 

208.58 212.24 B: yeah and i probably you know i probably maybe you know i w- 

212.04 225.73 B: probably would have focussed a little more in my freshman year in college um not that wouldn't have had to do with anything else but that's just something else that [sigh] you know that probably would not have been a bad thing [laughter] 

217.27 217.94 A: [laughter] 

224.72 229.95 A: right [laughter] 'cause i think everybody in the world could say that you know 

226.76 227.51 B: (( no )) 

228.96 234.15 B: right and so that's why i don- you know i don't look back on it with any kind of uh 

234.54 245.10 B: wi- with any kind of regret um because of that you know everybody pretty much says that so i'm not i'm not too worried about that 

240.87 242.13 A: yeah 

243.96 250.11 A: yeah i haven't made any sort of major horrifying mistake that i would go back and change i don't think 

249.46 253.27 B: yeah and i i haven't either and [sigh] even 

253.32 257.28 B: you know even then i've i've told myself over [noise] you know 

257.60 272.14 B: you know a couple of times oh you know if i i guess if i could have done it over again i would have gone somewhere else but i don't like i said i don't sit and [sigh] and dwell on it that's why when they said what the topic was i'm thinking oh gosh [laughter] 

266.60 267.82 A: right 

270.07 273.54 A: yeah what would i do what would i really do you know 

271.95 276.75 B: what really [sigh] well i guess that's a good position to to be in 

276.82 277.90 B: to be 

277.12 278.29 A: yeah you know 

278.72 285.02 A: maybe i i don't know i mean i- if it's really just sort of anything you could go back and change then you know 

285.31 287.37 A: (( i would have uh i )) 

288.12 294.32 A: don't know jeeze i almost cut my thumb off two years ago on the fourth of july so maybe i wouldn't have gone to work that day 

291.98 293.12 B: [laughter] 

293.77 295.59 B: [sigh] right 

294.85 297.63 A: i would've been like stay home it's not worth the money 

298.50 299.57 A: so 

299.62 302.77 B: you know and i think anybody could you know 

302.58 315.57 B: looking back in hindsight everybody could say oh well if i could go back and change one thing i would have invested in microsoft [laughter] [laughter] you know [laughter] i guess we could say something like that something that would have made me [sigh] would have made us 

309.51 311.14 A: (( yeah there you go yeah )) 

315.54 318.73 B: a little more wealthy than we are now but 

317.56 327.72 A: it might have been a moot point for me i think i might have been twelve i know it would have been a good idea to trust in [laughter] [laughter] microsoft [laughter] so yeah all my five dollars that i might have had and you know 

321.71 324.88 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

326.10 329.65 B: yeah yeah that's true [laughter] 

328.57 330.60 A: probably wouldn't have done much 

330.50 342.30 B: sounds like we're probably close to the same age so that's yeah that's [sigh] you know something that you know when we were twenty you know invest in intel or dell or you know one of those companies in 

332.75 334.04 A: [laughter] 

341.75 345.40 A: and know that you're going know to get out before it all 

344.30 348.39 B: yeah and sell out before clinton left off and [laughter] 

346.81 349.70 A: [laughter] 

350.36 351.78 A: exactly 

350.93 362.22 B: [laughter] 'cause i you know you just y- you can really make your life miserable if you keep looking back and saying oh i wish i could change that or or what if and yeah 'cause you can't it's not [sigh] 

357.77 360.94 A: yeah i should have done this i should done that 

362.36 368.82 B: worth really thinking about it it's more of a philosophy lesson than [laughter] 

364.55 365.51 A: no 

367.36 369.97 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

369.03 383.79 B: than anything else so [sigh] but i yeah i'm just i can't i'm thinking well would [sigh] you know maybe i wouldn't have gone out with a couple of girls [laughter] that were trouble yes like ew i would've 

379.56 382.17 A: yeah well there's always that 

382.80 387.54 A: sometimes it's the morning after you're like ooh jesus i wish i could have the you know last night back 

386.95 391.30 B: yeah i would have stayed away from from a couple of them but you know 

388.84 391.35 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

391.32 401.35 B: but again nobody nobody you know none of my relationships ruined my life so it's you know so i don't ever look back on it [sigh] and i say well you know [sigh] 

395.52 397.61 A: yeah exactly it's not like uh 

401.18 410.42 B: would have been nicer had i had i not got involved with that person but it's not like i go man that really screwed me up [laughter]
