74.84 88.56 A: yeah ah that's one thing i know i'd change about myself too i need in fact i'm it's one thing i hope to change [laughter] ah 'cause i need i know i need to exercise more i've kinda let that slip which is so easy to do i'm sure you know 

88.27 95.03 B: oh yes that's because i sit a lot a work on my one job i 

95.21 103.12 B: that i have um i'm a typist so i sit a lot and type so i don't get out there and exercise like i should

112.35 113.29 A: (( ah )) 

120.68 128.82 A: yeah i've done that for i mean off and on for long a for probably about ten years but um lately over the last probably about a year 

128.96 142.73 A: um i've just been really really busy and um i guess you know how it is you just kinda let things let some things that don't seem important they kinda slip by the wayside and then when you look back on it you realise that those things are important too 

143.18 150.93 B: oh yes 'cause i was thinking about going out to san francisco on a trip this fall and i'm 

145.28 146.37 A: (( [laughter] )) 

149.82 151.31 A: oh that sounds like fun 

151.19 156.46 B: oh yes and i'm thinking because see the last time i was out in san francisco back 

156.59 161.92 B: ninety five i didn't quite make it on the cable cars and 

161.31 162.21 A: uh-huh 

162.00 171.91 B: and sometimes i have ste- ah trouble going up steps unless i'm holding on to a rail or something and i don't even know if i'll be able to get up to get on the thing to go you know 

171.93 183.51 A: yeah i i was out in san francisco a long time ago when i was a little kid and ah we rode the cable cars i still remember that and ah it was e- i liked that i liked san francisco i think that's one of the nicest places in the united states i think [sigh] 

184.27 186.32 A: i like that fisherman's wharf too 

186.17 193.74 B: oh yeah that that was nice fisherman's wharf i had ah a nice seafood dinner off i forget which restaurant it was 

193.45 204.22 A: yeah i don't remember the details i just remember the i like good seafood and and ah they seemed like they had it there and i went to i think we went to one of the markets too and um and my i don't know it's 

204.31 213.09 A: been a w- a really long time but it seems like we went to some kinda market where they had fish and then they were ah had 'em all outside and everything else it was ah [sigh] real interesting 

213.77 218.22 A: um yeah if i could change something um 

218.55 230.08 A: i'm not really sure what i would change actually i don't know that i'd change that much i mean i think that i would probably try to exercise more but i think in some ways i still um i should look ahead 

229.94 234.31 A: and just go ahead and start exercising more right now [laughter] 

234.26 243.75 B: i know 'cause ah i forget who was telling me that if we had to do our lives over again we'd probably do the same thing over again make the same choices 

244.01 253.65 A: yeah in some ways it seems like um i don't know how much of a difference the details make and even some of the things that have happened um that have 

253.64 266.77 A: that you might look back and say they were bad it's hard to know what you might have had instead you might have had something actually worse [sigh] so i'm sorta clin- inclined just to take what i got and just try to keep on going 

266.95 268.54 A: but um 

269.35 276.31 A: i don't know i feel like i've been pretty lucky too and i'm pretty happy mostly so i can't i don't have too many complaints really

349.16 352.19 A: oh believe me i know yeah it's ah 

352.85 362.20 A: [sigh] it's expensive to take time off and go sometimes if you wanna go someplace far away 'cause then you gotta get there and then and then you have to pay for hotel and everything else but um 

362.49 367.66 A: on the other hand it's sometimes it's nice just to take time off and just relax really 

367.69 369.23 B: that is true 

367.84 368.94 A: um 

369.55 373.65 A: which sounds like sorta what you're planning to do in ah your virginia trip

416.15 421.86 B: oh okay so then you're pretty familiar [laughter] you know with this area 

421.52 429.67 A: sort of when i was in philadelphia though i didn't really get i didn't have a change to go around very much and i mostly was just in mostly just stayed in philly so 

430.07 433.45 A: um so i didn't see as much as i would have liked to 

433.62 442.00 A: but um in fact i really only saw philadelphia i got to know philadelphia pretty well 'cause i was there for ah i guess about four years but um 

442.03 455.31 A: i didn't get to see as much of the of that area as i as i would have liked the parts that i did see [sigh] which i you know i took some trips out to the um amish country in pennsylvania and that's always nice 

454.70 457.36 B: oh yes that's pretty country 

457.63 463.74 A: yeah it's kinda relaxing just to go out and just see their way of life which is so different from ours 

463.79 466.25 A: um in terms of you know they 

466.61 475.20 A: well i shouldn't say that it's more re- it's it doesn't i guess it's not more relaxing for them 'cause obviously they work seems like sixteen hours a day a lot but um 

475.45 480.86 A: it's just a little bit simpler than the fast paced things we got in the big city i guess 

482.88 496.18 B: oh yes and delaware as you're going i. ninety five um my thing you probably just sneeze and miss it [laughter] or or if you're sleeping in the car going by you can easily miss delaware
