1.70 3.06 A: (( hi this is jim )) 

2.83 5.62 B: hi jim how how are ya 

4.03 4.93 A: hi 

5.53 6.82 A: good 

6.08 12.52 B: [sigh] that's a good way to start off the conversation by saying what what we should have done in the past right [laughter] 

8.69 10.18 A: [laughter] 

11.12 13.58 A: i know [laughter] 

12.54 20.60 B: so many i don't think ten minutes is enough time [laughter] so [laughter] [sigh] what would you say 

15.51 17.98 A: [laughter] 

20.45 23.34 A: uh i don't know i gotta think about this here [lipsmack] 

23.33 24.41 B: yeah 

23.52 24.59 A: um 

26.91 28.94 A: (( [mn] ha ha ha ha )) 

32.40 47.31 B: well this is an easy one for me actually i was just talking uh i was just talking to a friend about it actually over the weekend um a friend of mine uh i live here in philadelphia and um a friend of mine got a job promotion to her their new york city office 

34.56 35.68 A: (( [mn] [mn] is it )) 

42.07 42.81 A: yeah 

46.88 48.28 A: (( right [noise] )) 

47.25 61.59 B: and she was really contemplating whether or not she should do it or not and i said to my i said to her oh my god absolutely you have to do it because that is the one thing that i wish i had done when i was like right out of college and i just uh you don't you don't live in new york do you 

58.87 59.83 A: right 

61.46 63.23 A: no no i live in atlanta 

62.83 71.42 B: in atlanta okay and um i i've lived in a couple of different cities and just not new york and i've always just thought oh that would have been so great and why did i 

71.34 84.30 B: you know miss out on doing that and of course by the time now [sigh] that uh i'd do it again it would probably be when i retire and i think i've got some other plans [laughter] i want to get over with so [laughter] it's just that it's so expensive to live in new york 

79.45 81.41 A: [laughter] 

84.09 89.91 B: that when you're younger you don't really have the money to really afford that city the way you want to 

84.46 85.78 A: yeah 

89.67 90.94 A: right 

90.55 92.58 B: [mn] but um 

93.46 98.01 B: so you live in atlanta well that's probably got a lot that new york has also 

98.23 101.52 A: [noise] yeah i guess [cough] if i had to change something 

102.04 103.88 A: i've just bought a new house 

103.45 104.69 B: mhm 

104.03 105.34 A: and um 

104.75 106.98 B: it's the money pit [laughter] 

106.81 111.60 A: no it's not well it is because it's new we're having to buy a lot but 

111.64 114.85 A: i probably would have waited um 

115.17 121.46 A: if i had it to do over just because of the way things are going now and i'm in the i._t. industry so you 

121.87 125.52 A: know it's it's tough everybody's still laying off and you 

125.39 126.44 B: (( right )) 

125.70 133.16 A: know my company's slow too so i probably would have held off um you know but instead i got in more debt [laughter] 

133.03 135.95 B: exactly what's a little bit more [laughter] 

133.45 135.46 A: just to get a nicer place so [noise] 

136.67 140.49 A: well yeah i mean you know you're already in debt already what the heck's a little more so 

139.59 143.02 B: right well you know the interest rates are so low so 

143.12 149.27 A: well yeah that's what made me do it really you know i'm hoping i made the right move because if if something happens 

149.43 152.28 A: it would be a disaster but um 

152.73 160.81 A: you know with the last house payment we had we could have done it for a while but so who knows we'll have to wait and see what happens 

160.47 162.06 B: [mn] yeah my 

161.16 163.38 A: i'm hanging in there like everybody else 

163.67 168.30 B: my philosophy too is that you know never say should have [laughter] 

167.99 169.26 A: right 

168.67 171.50 B: can't really change too many things about that 

171.63 176.21 A: [laughter] [noise] oh yeah and you only live once so you might as well enjoy life to the fullest 

173.45 174.75 B: mhm 

175.81 177.21 B: that's right 

176.65 187.57 A: and the way i see it if something uh you know bad happened you know it's going to happen uh one way or another whether we had a a cheaper home or [laughter] a more expensive home so 

186.08 187.34 B: right 

187.62 189.25 A: you know what can you do 

189.10 195.46 B: is um [lipsmack] so is -lanta is atlanta are they is it a pretty high cost of living there 

195.15 197.30 A: [noise] no it's actually pretty low 

196.87 197.86 B: is it 

198.67 200.31 B: so you get a lot of hou- [sigh] 

199.37 202.08 A: as far as housing goes you can get a lot of house 

201.50 204.11 B: a lot of house for your money yeah 

203.82 204.82 A: i mean we- 

204.86 211.29 A: for you know in atlanta like let's say you buy a three hundred thousand dollar house up in new york would probably cost 

211.32 213.71 A: you know eight hundred thousand dollars 

212.75 214.61 B: (( [sigh] really )) 

214.39 215.74 A: (( [noise] so )) 

216.75 227.66 A: and i've had people from california that say you know say that house in california would cost you know over a million to have so just to give you an idea like a buddy of mine 

227.90 233.57 A: [mn] we had on my last uh on the first house i own we had uh a house similar size 

233.82 236.53 A: and this was ten years ago but 

236.55 245.04 A: ten years ago in atlanta it was a hundred thousand dollar house out in seattle he paid three seventy five for a house the same size so [laughter] 

243.31 244.22 B: (( hm )) 

244.88 256.06 B: yeah it's crazy i actually i i'm in the process right now of um i'm studying for my real estate license and i and i and a lot of the uh comments that i get is that you're going to find a lot of people 

251.11 251.94 A: right 

256.14 269.62 B: um moving to the area from other parts of the country where they're used to a lot more house for a lot less money and certainly a lot less property taxes our property taxes are very high here 

263.14 264.01 A: right 

264.73 265.88 A: right 

269.50 274.79 B: so um it's you know it's like how do you sell how do you sell somebody that [laughter] and 

274.67 288.87 B: you know the answer is location location location so um [lipsmack] but yeah it's it's it's crazy although that's the one thing with the market like you said that you can count on i mean real estate's doing great that's an odd an odds on high so hopefully 

276.99 278.25 A: right 

289.22 291.37 A: do houses sell pretty quick up there 

290.91 302.44 B: oh yeah i mean usually like within two weeks i mean you can't be you can't be a buyer that like needs to sit and ponder 'cause you'll miss out on your opportunity and there's just not that many people selling so in 

291.94 292.81 A: yeah 

293.82 295.36 A: oh wow [noise] 

301.70 304.18 A: yeah and down here it's totally opposite 

303.63 305.18 B: really 

304.77 310.79 A: yeah down here it's a buyer's market and houses are just aren't selling 'cause there's so many of 'em 

310.21 312.35 B: mhm 

311.24 313.97 A: [mn] and it took us eleven months to sell our house 

314.40 315.66 B: (( [lipsmack] wow )) 

315.69 318.37 A: just because there were so many in that price range so 

317.80 319.53 B: [sigh] right 

320.23 321.86 B: huh that's interesting 

322.07 328.55 A: and there's a lot of new homes in this area too so you know people that have older homes are competing with all the new homes 

328.35 329.89 B: [sigh] right 

329.11 330.01 A: so 

330.56 335.56 B: although there's a there's there's a lot of things that the older homes have that the newer homes don't 

330.92 332.48 A: that 

335.71 337.04 A: yeah that's true 

338.17 344.27 B: [sigh] but um [sigh] so what else can we say about this topic to stay on this talk bit [laughter] 

342.67 343.75 A: um 

344.90 350.18 B: what is it one if you could only choose thing is that what it said you can have one thing that you should have done differently 

348.45 350.69 A: yeah it said one thing but 

351.12 354.28 A: you know it doesn't take me ten minutes really [laughter] to 

354.05 355.40 B: yeah 

354.63 359.95 A: talk about that one thing i mean maybe if we had several things we could talk about um [noise] 

360.42 365.26 B: [sigh] it's almost like a what do you so how what's the thought process that you go through to even 

365.41 370.23 B: think about that you know that would be more of an interesting topic [laughter] i think 

369.40 371.21 A: yeah yeah i know 

370.27 375.64 B: what you know what do what do you go through to to have that idea pop into your head i mean 

376.92 382.67 B: it's you know yours was something recent you know that you had just done so and mine is some 

379.39 381.18 A: right 

381.60 383.69 A: yeah i did it last month so 

382.81 389.36 B: right so it's fresh on your mind and you think wow you know i should have done that but um 

389.83 395.29 B: you know mine was mine was from the past so i try not to think i'm not somebody that really 

395.30 400.33 B: worries about the past i'm always like here's the present let's look towards the future [laughter] 

399.38 403.14 A: (( i'm the same way [laughter] )) 

401.02 404.51 B: (( yeah so but um )) 

405.34 412.57 B: [lipsmack] i'm trying to think of something else i might have done differently did it say regret or did it say do do differently 

412.87 416.26 A: it said do differently didn't it i don't think it said regret 

413.77 415.32 B: do differently it 

415.67 417.80 B: didn't say regret okay 

416.89 420.31 A: you know i don't know that i really have any regrets 

420.13 422.11 B: (( yeah )) 

421.29 422.23 A: (( you know [mn] )) 

426.56 427.96 B: is that your other phone [laughter]

459.03 461.37 B: they called you when i called in right 

461.99 467.04 B: yeah it's uh an interesting study i'd be curious to see what they do with the information afterwards 

466.94 468.81 A: yeah yeah 

468.60 470.60 B: do you know if they're going to be sharing that 

470.44 474.26 A: you know i i don't know i i haven't heard if they do or not 

473.67 480.46 B: maybe that's something i would have done differently before i signed on [laughter] i would have found out exactly and 

476.77 478.39 A: [laughter] 

479.20 483.92 A: i mean they've got my email address but i don't know if they share any of that with you or not is
