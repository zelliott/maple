10.63 13.39 B: oh okay this is my third call today so 

12.91 19.66 A: oh i'm being beeped though can i possibly get that does could it does it work like that like some my call waiting is kicking in 

17.79 18.35 B: (( [mn] ))

21.36 22.07 A: oh 

22.57 26.54 A: okay okay so uh do you i don't know how to do this [lipsmack] 

24.46 25.47 B: (( yeah )) 

25.63 32.72 B: [lipsmack] well it's just we go ahead and talk if there was something back in time [sigh] uh in your past that you would like to change what would it be 

32.76 43.75 A: i would probably go back in time to when i got married and i was so young and i think maybe i would see the world more and have more experience before i would get married at twenty [sigh] 

44.10 45.39 B: okay 

44.86 46.17 A: okay [laughter] 

45.85 48.53 B: and what would you have done differently 

49.52 53.52 A: maybe have gone out with more guys or something i guess 

53.36 54.18 B: (( okay )) 

53.87 54.89 A: okay 

56.88 61.07 B: are you still married to your husband oh okay well then you made a pretty good 

58.10 59.24 A: yes i am 

59.83 62.06 A: almost almost thirty years but 

61.34 63.16 B: it's a pretty good choice then huh 

62.56 68.93 A: yeah yeah yeah it's just that i [sigh] i don't know i just felt feel like looking at my children 

69.18 82.46 A: that i was so young i didn't think it then i looking back i was so young i was barely twenty [sigh] you know and uh [lipsmack] oh i love my man and i think i'd want to end up with him but i [sigh] maybe see more of 

74.83 75.91 B: mhm 

82.74 89.60 A: you know see more of the world socialize i didn't go to college maybe go to college [sigh] you know things like that [lipsmack] 

89.10 90.07 B: mhm 

90.36 91.69 B: okay 

91.39 94.63 A: am i supposed to ask you this or you just ask me this [laughter] 

93.90 97.75 B: no i didn't we [mn] it's both ways it's both ways [sigh] 

95.87 97.03 A: (( oh okay )) 

97.06 98.92 A: okay what would you change 

98.32 111.02 B: i think i probably would have looked to marry someone differently [sigh] i i was kind of uh later in life getting getting together with someone and finally getting married uh i was twenty seven when i had my first child um 

101.16 102.60 A: (( oh marry someone different )) 

109.57 110.62 A: right 

110.81 113.69 B: but the the man i married was not a good choice 

113.32 114.84 A: oh oh okay 

113.84 118.11 B: um and i raised them by myself from the time they were two and three 

116.43 116.99 A: (( [mn] )) 

117.81 119.08 A: right wow 

118.15 120.54 B: and they're now twenty two and twenty one 

120.16 123.49 A: right right that must have been hard though yeah [sigh] 

121.40 122.20 B: so 

122.89 136.08 B: yeah i think i would have uh like uh looked around better and and uh traveled even more than i did travel quite a bit but i would have liked to have traveled more i did go to college but i um [sigh] 

130.97 131.96 A: right 

132.51 133.92 A: right right 

136.01 144.68 B: didn't go wind up going for what i wanted to go for um so i probably would have liked to have stayed in school and and went further for my degree 

138.92 140.18 A: right right mhm 

144.48 145.66 A: yeah 

145.17 156.57 B: so i guess the biggest thing was the um choosing the wrong partner you were very fortunate [sigh] because very few people today who can say they've been married thirty years so that's a real blessing 

150.71 151.74 A: (( right right )) 

153.62 155.34 A: i know i know 

155.75 160.46 A: and and then i still love him so and he loves me so that's that's good you know 

157.98 158.76 B: (( [mn] )) 

159.56 163.27 B: that's and even bigger blessing that's right but yeah 

160.81 165.18 A: yeah yeah but [sigh] but i w- i was very young i had a like a 

165.13 176.00 A: it's a t- a fatal blood disease and they didn't think i would make it and that was between the time i was seventeen and twenty so by the time i went into remission [sigh] i had known him since i was like fourteen [sigh] 

175.78 186.40 A: and he didn't ask me out till i was fifteen 'cause he he was eighteen and fourteen was too young but fifteen was okay [sigh] you know [laughter] so um [laughter] uh it was like 

182.50 183.62 B: [laughter] 

186.55 196.43 A: he was very good to me he would come to the hospital every day and and visit me and i knew he really loved me [sigh] it's just that between seventeen and twenty i didn't do much other than being sick 

196.50 197.65 B: mhm 

196.87 211.21 A: you know going for blood transfusions and [sigh] i w- i did graduate high school and i [sigh] had to go for blood but i was determined to walk down the aisle with my cap and gown and i did and straight from the h- straight from graduation we i'd go and i'd get blood 

211.17 218.28 A: [sigh] so it wasn't really a normal thing to begin with you know normal teenage years or whatever 

214.54 215.51 B: mhm 

218.43 219.85 B: now do you have children 

219.61 221.16 A: yeah yeah i 

220.44 221.55 B: how old are they 

221.26 227.40 A: i have a daughter who's twenty four and a son who's twenty and i have a fifteen year old son 

227.48 228.72 B: oh wow 

228.12 230.54 A: yes yeah we have three 

230.42 231.67 B: oh that's nice 

230.81 245.53 A: [cough] and they're the thank god i mean they're honor students good kids [sigh] grad- uh the first one graduated college and she has a very good job with a publishing house and the middle one's in college now and the little one's in high school doing well so 

245.52 247.65 A: you've got to count your blessings you know 

246.80 249.74 B: [mn] yep and we do have a lot of those don't we 

249.31 251.17 A: yes absolutely 

250.61 252.96 B: we do yeah 

251.31 253.47 A: you've got to look at it that way absolutely 

253.84 264.03 B: [lipsmack] yeah i have uh my daughter graduated from the university of arizona she's out in california and my son is [sigh] um still dabbling and find trying to find his way 

258.09 259.31 A: oh okay 

263.58 265.65 A: yeah yeah all right 

265.16 266.89 B: so [sigh] but uh 

265.77 270.64 A: some kids know what they want to do and other kids go for many years and they don't know what to do 

270.47 272.08 B: yeah this is true 

270.97 273.15 A: (( you know yeah yeah )) 

272.25 274.12 B: this is true and they're all different 

273.85 281.52 A: yeah i think girls are a little more motivated [laughter] or not motivated but i don't know or at least i think that my daughter was like that and my 

280.72 282.26 B: well they're more directed 

281.86 285.35 A: yeah yeah i think so i think so absolutely 

282.72 283.69 B: mhm 

284.07 285.16 B: yeah 

285.37 286.27 A: yeah 

285.49 291.77 B: [sigh] well with your son being the youngest is he the um uh [sigh] i- is he pampered and spoiled 

291.19 301.67 A: oh yeah yeah my other two kids would say that i'm spoiling him and i see it now that [sigh] i did spoil him [sigh] he's basically a good kid he can be a pain in the butt but they all can 

301.34 302.76 B: mhm 

301.78 313.86 A: you know when th- he is spoilt and pampered but he he has a very good heart and [sigh] he's still like my little like he'll still like come to me scratch his back and he's still he likes that little extra attention 

314.15 321.59 A: you know and i and i haven't worked all these years so i've been here and taking care of them and that's it you know 

321.69 323.57 A: so he is spoilt [laughter] 

323.24 325.09 B: well that's kind of nice though 

324.70 326.07 A: yeah yeah 

325.81 326.69 B: you know 

326.24 329.43 A: yeah yeah it was a choice i made 

329.70 330.80 A: [lipsmack] you know 

329.83 331.43 B: and that was a good choice too 

331.07 335.41 A: yeah yeah i mean i at least i had a choice that i could make and 

331.60 333.14 B: mhm 

335.34 341.23 A: [sigh] i did have a career before i was a medical assistant and i loved it and [sigh] and then i 

341.17 352.51 A: took a leave of absence when i had my daughter and i just never went back i took my a year maternity leave and i just [sigh] i figured i do have the opportunity i can stay home and why should i pay someone [sigh] to see her first steps 

352.37 353.82 B: mhm 

352.69 355.50 A: and i was lucky that i could do that 

355.47 359.40 B: yeah i wasn't i worked from when my children were uh raising them 

356.20 356.80 A: (( [sigh] [mn] )) 

357.21 360.51 A: right right well because because it was only you 

360.21 361.89 B: (( yeah ))

362.10 363.87 B: yeah 

365.38 374.78 B: most definitely in fact i kind of uh that's one of the things that i wish i could have changed i wish i would have married [sigh] a different man and would have been able to stay home with my children 

366.28 367.88 A: yeah yeah right 

374.36 380.53 A: right right [sigh] but you know i think maybe your children appreciate you more than my children appreciate me m-
