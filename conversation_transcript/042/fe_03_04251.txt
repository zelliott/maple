24.92 29.51 B: don't know i guess if you could go back and it always you can always do like uh 

29.96 34.31 B: like looking back you can always say oh i could have done that so much differently 

34.03 35.12 A: yeah 

34.57 37.62 B: and like monday morning quarterbacking 

37.65 46.12 A: mhm do you have one uh [sigh] one topic exactly in mind you think you would probably change if you could 

44.95 56.08 B: [laughter] [sigh] um yeah i got married really early and it wasn't a good relationship and i ended up getting [sigh] um you know i ended up getting divorced a year later so 

49.19 50.05 A: (( mhm )) 

55.79 56.73 A: (( mhm )) 

56.14 60.44 B: if i could go back in time i actually would've listened to all my family members and 

60.36 61.61 A: (( oh yeah )) 

61.06 62.53 B: [laughter] 

61.76 65.02 A: (( because they told you and you wouldn't listen right )) 

64.16 65.91 B: right [laughter] 

65.26 74.25 A: yeah usually uh when we young we thinks we know everything and [noise] and sometime it's not really the case you know [cough] [noise] 

74.55 87.60 A: well about myself uh i don't know in my life if i have anything i could change if i could change anything maybe i would say i would try to go 

88.03 95.08 A: [noise] when i by the way i am from uh another country you know so i am not from here 

92.75 93.81 B: mhm 

95.25 100.12 A: [noise] so i would say when i first got here i would probably 

99.98 112.78 A: went to school and tried to get you know my degree [noise] but i probably it's not like i wasn't thinking about that but it's the circumstances you know that i had to deal with [noise] 

112.67 124.77 A: that was a problem so i don't think in real life you know everything that i would say maybe if i could change i don't think i had any problem over here so 

125.24 126.40 B: mhm 

125.61 132.19 A: [noise] i like i say you know like i had children when i came over here and 

132.12 145.84 A: [noise] i had to take of them you know er there is no way you could have said well let me go to school and take a couple of years do this do that then i can come back [noise] because [noise] [sigh] when you're dealing if you're dealing with things 

132.29 132.85 B: (( [noise] )) 

134.32 135.32 B: right 

145.83 149.25 A: [noise] that's different than when you dealing with people you know 

148.77 150.16 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

149.52 156.00 A: and i i think that would be the only thing i would say if i could change 

156.04 161.99 A: [noise] one thing maybe i wouldn't have probably children as early as i did but [noise] 

162.71 169.79 A: hey you know it's hard to think about these things when they're already happened especially when they are people you know 

169.30 170.81 B: yeah 

170.26 171.44 A: and love 

171.76 184.58 A: and other than that do you have any other things you think you can what make you think like do you you said maybe your parents or your family members were right about your situation 

184.94 191.61 A: how do what exactly do you think they told you that you couldn't understand then 

191.37 202.35 B: [noise] [laughter] well they told me he was like no good [noise] and i'm like oh no no no no [sigh] and he ended up like you know taking so much money from me and doing all this stuff and [sigh] 

195.06 196.06 A: (( [laughter] )) 

202.20 207.74 A: and there is no way you couldn't say that to him you know at the beginning 

202.80 203.77 B: and 

209.24 210.63 B: oh what 

210.21 215.41 A: or were you because you were so much you think you were so much in love and 

214.24 220.89 B: yeah that was exactly i just didn't nothing anybody could say bad you know i didn't like that and [noise] [sigh] 

220.93 225.25 B: no he wasn't going to you know take advantage of me and all this stuff and 

224.57 225.72 A: mhm 

226.34 232.33 B: so then i had to go back a couple of years later with my you know tail between my legs and [laughter] 

230.44 231.46 A: mhm 

231.70 239.54 A: then what did your parents or family members or whoever they are did they tell you i told you so or they just 

239.22 249.49 B: no my mom it was my mom and but she didn't really do and i told you so 'cause [noise] i learned my lesson [noise] i really learned my lesson so 

239.76 241.29 A: (( kind of help you )) 

241.38 242.60 A: mhm 

245.94 246.84 A: mhm 

247.27 248.18 A: yeah 

248.81 249.68 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

249.64 252.90 B: she just said it was a learning experience so 

252.94 258.80 A: (( so how that experience help you now through your life you know afterward )) 

256.55 260.16 B: [laughter] it's made me a lot smarter 

259.74 260.79 A: uh-huh 

260.38 268.35 B: and you definitely do trust [noise] you know i if somebody i value their opinion like my mother 

267.88 269.16 A: mhm 

268.74 272.37 B: i definitely do listen to her from no on [laughter] 

271.24 273.36 A: (( [laughter] well )) 

272.91 274.36 B: [laughter] 

274.12 281.64 A: well i don't think you should let that you know make you generalize you know every 

282.12 293.12 A: [noise] every other people that you meet because usually when some things like that happen people usually think [noise] you know maybe everybody is the same way [noise] 

293.29 298.54 A: (( and i probably you know there are some good and bad in both [noise] )) 

298.63 300.80 A: you know uh sides 

300.25 301.32 B: mhm 

300.89 307.21 A: and i am sure like you said about yourself and i think maybe there are [noise] 

307.44 314.90 A: men too who are talking about you know like if they know that they wouldn't get married either you know so 

314.09 315.38 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

314.97 323.13 A: like i said don't think that's only happen you know on the men's side but you know usually it happens in both sides and 

323.58 326.74 A: [noise] and i'm sure there are some men who can tell you 

326.79 333.70 A: [noise] y- you know you can be probably in relationships in every way and you don't take 

333.99 343.07 A: you don't take people's opinion and usually and usually believe me like your parents they don't want to be right even though they can 

343.31 357.71 A: [noise] smell you know like something a mile away but they always want to think maybe that could be different because they don't want their children to be in any situation just to be able to [noise] be right you know 

345.81 346.66 B: mhm 

357.18 358.93 B: mhm 

358.16 369.25 A: but th- that that's why kindred more spirits like you know [noise] if they told you something [noise] then sometimes they can tell you something maybe you you could have been successful in your [noise] 

369.82 372.71 A: you know in your marriage you never know 

372.33 374.00 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

373.39 384.80 A: even though they would say well you know sometimes and they have an idea about someth- some you know somebody and then that person turned out to be you know a changed person [noise] 

385.18 389.28 A: even though they were like you know anyone or whatever but 

389.65 400.27 A: [noise] probably some people whatever people perceive of them they just let it go and say well once they said that i'm not going to make any effort i'm just going to let it [laughter] you know 

399.96 401.29 B: mhm 

400.64 404.42 A: whatever they said i'm going to go with that you know 

405.81 415.94 A: and anyway that uh person didn't prove your parents wrong and that probably will always want that to be like show our parents we have uh [noise] 

416.00 420.93 A: a better understanding of people or things than they are [laughter] 

421.30 428.40 B: yeah that's 'cause i want to be like oh i'm going you know i'm going i'm going to do this i'm going to make it work and you know i'm going to prove them all wrong but 

427.47 429.05 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

428.52 430.14 B: no [laughter] 

429.78 433.69 A: [noise] and probably you didn't get any help from the other side huh 

431.87 434.01 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] [noise] )) 

434.54 441.97 A: yeah [noise] so what have uh what about decisions you thinking now you are more careful about them 

440.67 449.79 B: oh yeah it it was a really big learning lesson i don't like trust everybody i meet um i read people a lot better 

446.41 447.45 A: mhm 

449.97 455.28 A: oh you read people a lot better or you become paranoid or something or whatever 

453.41 456.71 B: [noise] no i i usually [noise] 

456.89 460.72 B: i don't hand my money over to everybody who asks me for it now 

461.07 468.79 A: yeah that that's another thing maybe that's a good lesson you learned you try to hold your money instead of giving it to people anyway 

463.61 465.34 B: [noise] yeah [laughter] 

466.24 467.00 B: (( [laughter] )) 

468.56 473.37 B: it was an expensive lesson but i learned it [noise] 

471.58 472.73 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

472.81 476.45 A: and where are you now in your life do you think you are [noise] 

477.31 485.10 B: [laughter] i'm a lot [noise] smarter it actually it it wasn't very good um i know i said this a million times it was a learning [noise] lesson 

483.71 484.63 A: mhm 

484.97 485.77 A: (( mm mm )) 

485.33 488.88 B: it helped m- me mature greatly 

487.82 489.00 A: mhm 

489.18 490.14 B: (( [noise] um )) 

491.54 498.61 B: [noise] [lipsmack] if i could go back i wouldn't have chosen that route but [noise] it made me a smarter person

508.26 515.26 B: [noise] oh well then um [noise] well if i could go back i would um [noise] [lipsmack] i would have finished school 

515.52 521.06 B: [noise] i would've yeah i would've yeah [noise] 'cause i [noise] i um dropped out of college [noise] so 

515.54 517.43 A: oh you didn't finish school
