122.52 125.07 B: put together um 

125.19 129.48 B: things we used in the past but but

184.42 186.14 A: oh yeah 

185.71 194.75 B: really oh okay okay well that's i'm i'm kinda thinking of doing that making things that we used to use you know 

192.68 193.85 A: mhm 

194.73 205.94 B: used to use uh years ago and you know kind of a kind of a general store [laughter] t- yeah they're just too many coffee shops out there [laughter] 

200.54 203.92 A: oh huh that would be fun um 

204.11 208.48 A: i've tried selling some stuff on e. bay you know a little bit but 

206.87 209.01 B: oh you did have you tried that

222.94 224.85 A: um well i was for 

224.95 239.42 A: about a year ago and then i kinda kinda just fizzled out on it you know it just the last few lots i put in didn't s- didn't sell and so then i kind of i just kind of uh stopped but i think i i'm getting in the mood to 

233.29 234.87 B: oh okay 

235.87 237.68 B: [laughter] kind of [noise] 

239.52 241.92 A: you know start trying it again

243.06 245.26 B: um well 

245.29 249.60 B: [mn] did you find it easy to sell on e. bay i mean is that 

248.54 252.49 A: i found it's very easy to post your stuff on there 

251.98 257.53 B: okay so you don't need to go through a long drawn out application process 

252.70 254.36 A: the biggest problem 

254.80 255.95 A: oh no 

256.09 262.35 A: in fact i even found out how to put in pictures it's real easy they've got it all down to a a real science 

261.77 263.64 B: really really 

262.36 267.65 A: but you can actually get a store on there too if you want i don't know how to how 

265.83 267.14 B: really 

267.81 271.07 A: that works but i know that they have them available 

270.80 274.67 B: oh really so i could have this little store where i sell 

271.12 272.67 A: where you can uh 

273.26 280.08 A: yeah you could get checkout y- you know what the way e. bay has arranged i don't know for sure 

276.43 277.86 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

277.95 279.43 B: oh okay 

280.30 285.23 A: um i know it's a little different setup than their regular um 

281.08 281.80 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

283.92 284.51 B: (( [noise] )) 

285.61 287.83 B: than the regular just the auction 

286.75 289.27 A: yeah just putting the auction stuff on 

288.44 290.28 B: mhm mhm 

289.40 296.35 A: but uh i know it's a you know some people do have actual full stores like a mall you know it's like a shopping mall 

292.76 293.97 B: right 

295.15 296.08 B: (( right )) 

296.35 302.05 B: (( really well that now that would be interesting what i what i'm interested in is is )) 

296.95 297.84 A: uh-huh 

302.10 313.40 B: is a business where it's a one item business that always interested me they seem the most successful like a mrs fields cookies [noise] where she just sold cookies [noise] 

303.35 304.23 A: mhm 

307.37 308.40 A: mhm 

312.03 313.99 A: yeah just one thing 

313.49 324.16 B: yeah just one thing so when people walk into your store they immediately know why they're there [laughter] they're not looking around and they know 

321.00 322.18 A: mhm 

324.30 327.64 B: what they want for the most part you know a cookie 

325.44 327.19 A: right uh-huh 

327.73 338.33 B: and uh that's those businesses like a coffee business because it's a one item they seem to work that seems to work rather than [noise] 

327.95 328.76 A: sure 

331.73 332.82 A: mhm 

335.22 336.51 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

338.48 351.49 B: fifty you know fifty items you know yeah in fact i talked to a friend and she was saying oh uh okay we should make candles and then we should have soaps and we should ha- you know which goes together 

340.92 341.97 A: right 

350.18 352.04 A: (( hm hm )) 

351.32 357.49 B: and then she was mentioning i said okay it's candles and soaps and that should be it 

357.09 358.35 A: mhm 

357.52 371.12 B: it shouldn't get into everything that you had in your drawer you know [laughter] or you know 'til it gets out of out of control but yeah i think i think if i had the money um 

362.67 364.28 A: mhm right 

372.19 379.04 B: [lipsmack] yeah i would try [mn] like i said a small business where it was geared to one 

379.28 388.93 B: type of item like maybe aprons or i was even thinking today i was looking at um jeweled um clothes you know like 

382.23 383.20 A: mhm 

388.32 389.40 A: mhm 

388.91 396.38 B: um i saw this woman in a magazine who had on a it looked like a halter top but it was all made of pearls 

394.25 395.25 A: mhm 

396.16 397.62 A: ooh how pretty 

396.99 409.34 B: i know it was just gorgeous and her eye glasses had they were those old fashioned hollywood style cat eye gla- uh sunglasses and they had pearls all around them 

405.25 406.21 A: uh-huh 

408.87 409.74 A: (( mm mhm )) 

409.27 418.86 B: you know and i was thinking oh god how beautiful you know you could easily do that with ri- you know maybe um thrift store buy a bunch of glasses 

412.82 413.66 A: (( mm )) 

418.77 425.54 B: and uh put rhinestones or pearls around them and sell them you know or something like that i 

422.29 422.87 A: mm 

425.88 428.29 B: uh i i don't know [laughter] 

427.36 438.48 A: that was e- a neat idea if you hear some kind of roaring noise here my cat has just jumped over here and he's he's nuzzling up to the phone and purring as loud as he possibly can 

435.95 436.67 B: (( i )) 

437.15 446.94 B: [mn] yeah uh oh cute how cute [laughter] oh oh i you know i miss the miss that i i'm allergic to cats sorry

471.17 472.11 A: hm 

475.96 476.82 A: oh 

476.98 487.79 A: well that's interesting i mean i know i'm allergic to him because about a year ago i was in the hospital and i was there for about three days and my allergies all cleared up and as soon as i came home they started up again 

478.04 479.06 B: yeah 

485.28 487.07 B: oh wow 

487.89 494.59 A: so my um [lipsmack] doctor just gave me some zertec [laughter] that seems to help a lot 

487.89 488.65 B: (( mhm )) 

492.64 499.45 B: oh some zertec really yeah i i right i can't take it i mean when i'm when i'm around them

506.53 511.85 A: well your i like your ideas about um you know the old fashioned stuff mm 

510.81 515.01 B: really you that one sounds good [noise] okay 

512.92 521.47 A: yeah i've got another idea i had sometime i well i actually had a business for a while i was mak- i have knitting machines and i was making uh 

521.47 522.49 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh )) 

521.72 522.86 A: (( scarves )) 

522.54 523.70 B: (( mhm )) 

523.45 530.04 A: yeah well i used to do contract knitting for other people too uh but for stores you know and and um 

528.50 530.48 B: oh really oh okay 

529.93 542.92 A: but um i designed a line of scarves and i have one that i i still think i'm going to make up some and and put on e. bay but i can't do the knitting as much anymore with my machines it's just too strenuous to do 

533.37 534.27 B: mhm 

542.95 549.83 A: plus you know i would be limited as to how many i could make [laughter] i'd have to find other people with the same machines 

545.81 547.33 B: (( right )) 

549.27 551.11 B: mhm mhm 

550.09 554.62 A: and who could uh contract it out you know for me and then 

552.64 553.91 B: right how 

554.13 560.26 B: when you got orders did they request a certain number of scarves or 

559.45 562.83 A: yeah i was s- selling to some stores for a while 

562.78 563.69 B: mhm 

562.93 568.53 A: um but i had one i had music designs and those were real popular i put 'em in music stores 

568.23 570.44 B: oh wow [laughter] [lipsmack] 

568.90 576.53 A: but then i have another one that i think would be you know pretty popular right now it's um a flag 

576.56 582.06 A: it has uh half of it is blue with white stars and the other half is red and white stripes 

581.72 584.13 B: wow [laughter] 

582.76 595.96 A: and when you put it on you know they cross you know and and ya see both sides and it looks really nice and that one turned out so good that i started making some other ones that were half one thing like 

584.37 585.16 B: mhm 

595.87 599.89 A: um and half another thing like i would have um
