199.39 208.83 A: yeah yeah yeah a person always wishes that [sigh] listen i went to college and i still wish i had stuck with [laughter] the very first job i had [laughter]

251.07 252.43 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

251.34 254.44 A: so you kind of move in a new area it's hard to get in 

255.10 258.28 A: [lipsmack] so um we just made a business of our own 

258.80 261.05 A: and that seems to work out okay 

260.96 263.55 B: (( oh yeah that's good [noise] [noise] )) 

262.22 269.70 A: yeah [lipsmack] well it's interesting that you you realized you should have finished high school [sigh] you didn't get your g. e. d. 

268.79 274.52 B: [noise] no [noise] i started it a couple of times and [sigh] you know i haven't 

274.78 276.01 B: i mean you know 

276.09 277.42 B: been wanting to 

277.95 284.44 B: [noise] try to find something on line [noise] where i could just do it [noise] you know from [sigh] the comfort of my home and 

280.60 281.80 A: yeah 

281.96 283.03 A: from home 

283.31 284.47 A: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

285.53 286.42 A: huh 

286.52 287.89 A: that's interesting 

287.91 290.31 A: it's been a long time since you were in school 

290.45 291.63 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah ))

324.09 325.79 B: [noise] multiplication and [noise] 

324.84 337.84 A: sure sure basic things that you would know yeah [lipsmack] i'm always surprised in son's classes they let him use a calculator all the time [sigh] [lipsmack] so i'm thinking if you could use a calculator you might just whiz [laughter] right past those figures [sigh] 

333.15 334.38 B: (( [noise] oh yeah [noise] )) 

337.20 340.07 B: oh yeah i know that that's how i did it in school so

361.85 363.18 B: mhm 

362.26 365.37 A: but not too late thirty five is not too late 

364.90 368.33 B: [noise] yeah i know yeah every [sigh] there's something 

368.45 375.66 B: in everybody's life or past that they wish they could go back and change i mean [sigh] y- you know 

372.86 374.01 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

374.80 376.32 A: really there is 

375.84 378.34 B: yeah even if it's it's nothing
