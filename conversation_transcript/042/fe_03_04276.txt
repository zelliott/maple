206.11 206.90 A: (( no )) 

207.11 211.95 B: there's the old science fiction um [lipsmack] theory 

212.23 222.03 B: that if you go back in time and let's say you step on ant and the ant w- um back in the day you know jurassic period 

221.43 223.30 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

222.45 236.14 B: and the ant would've been eaten by eaten by a cricket and the cricket would've been eaten by a snake and the snake would've been eaten by a and so on and so on and so on and as a result instead of having bush for president right now 

235.97 238.97 B: saddam hussein would be president 

239.22 242.78 A: well i don't want him for president so [laughter] 

240.96 245.23 B: no but do you understand the the conundrum there that this 

244.32 252.16 A: 'cause he just visited one of our c- cities um i think it was today or yesterday um pierce city missouri 

252.54 255.90 A: you know we're the ones that've gotten all the bad weather here 

255.88 258.07 B: yeah you had the hurr- tornadoes 

257.48 259.69 A: oh yes [sigh] yes 

259.15 261.44 B: were they literally where you are 

261.06 268.60 A: not where we were but um the forces of that are around us we went inside and it's it's really bad

273.04 274.45 A: (( so [mn] )) 

275.25 283.75 A: you know other than that you know i wish we could avoid tornadoes but i guess we can't because it's a part of mother nature 

285.01 286.51 A: (( so [sigh] )) 

285.06 293.14 B: [noise] but but anyway my theory about time travel is that if you went back [noise] 

293.52 296.03 B: yesterday to change something 

295.35 296.35 A: mhm 

296.23 298.38 B: today would not be the same day

300.84 303.22 B: (( r- exactly )) 

302.13 306.11 A: was like ah i don't think [laughter] that would be a very good idea 

306.16 310.07 A: [laughter] i'd just rather go forward [laughter] 

310.49 315.83 A: 'cause there's a lot of stuff that i've done that i don't that i regret but you know you just gotta go on with life [sigh] 

317.91 320.99 B: (( page up is how i modify ah )) 

321.31 325.51 B: okay i've just figured out what i wanna do

381.38 383.01 A: around the
