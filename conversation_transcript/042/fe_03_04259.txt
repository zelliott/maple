93.25 95.55 B: to be the you know to reach the no 

93.26 98.88 A: well you'll never know but you do have the education they can't take that away from you 

98.46 105.05 B: they can't but uh uh to me you can get that education on your own if you're if you just have the desire to read and keep 

103.02 112.40 A: well practical education and college education is not quite the same but uh i can say i have no regrets 

107.97 109.21 B: well 

109.53 110.82 B: the kind of education 

112.22 125.73 A: how it turned it [noise] uh i just if i had to say a regret was not continuing it because i was doing very well in school [sigh] but uh you know e- e- everything is in a time that you graduate there's still a time of the depression

244.36 248.35 A: oh yeah when you're up the front lines it makes no difference what you are 

247.67 248.57 B: uh-huh 

248.50 252.03 A: tell me about yourself because i'm hogging the whole thing 

251.40 253.31 B: well that's that's just fine 

253.33 257.02 B: i i guess i would have uh i would have chosen a different college to go to 

256.88 259.59 A: oh you did get a college education good for you 

258.03 260.86 B: yah uh yeah but i never finished 

260.45 262.47 A: that's all right you got something 

262.10 263.87 B: yah but uh 

264.46 266.61 B: then i went away and 

266.04 267.77 A: h- how did you end up 

267.15 279.01 B: it wasn't uh it wasn't quite the programme i had anticipated then then they had some uh they had some pr- uh some uh classes that i had to take for instance i was in the mass communications uh curriculum 

270.80 271.75 A: uh-huh 

278.37 279.76 A: yeah 

279.30 282.35 B: so we had to take what they call a photo journalism course 

282.04 283.05 A: uh-huh 

282.42 290.58 B: which was fine but it was it was uh uh taught by a by the instructor who is in the art school 

290.53 291.87 A: i see 

291.28 304.33 B: yeah and one of the things we had to do was build our own pinhole camera i believe they call it you know out of cardboard and you put the black paper you had to build one of your own n- now you know i was never i was never handy with my hands like that 

298.80 299.73 A: yeah 

303.58 304.79 A: (( oh all )) 

304.22 309.62 B: so i you know so i said uh i can't so that that was that was the one course i had to take over again 

309.76 310.76 A: (( right )) 

310.32 317.24 B: yeah and there was uh there was some uh i had some other difficulties with i mean i didn't realize i had to take some of these courses [sigh] but if i had gone to 

317.33 319.77 B: a college closer to home you 

319.98 320.84 A: yeah 

320.21 321.01 B: know 

321.09 324.19 B: well well but of course i would have missed the experience of living away 

324.71 326.30 A: (( you were scared of that )) 

325.69 328.49 B: well no i wasn't scared of that i wanted to do that 

327.88 330.41 A: oh you wanted to do that all right 

328.99 338.13 B: yeah but you know the the the college i probably should have gone to would have would have uh i would have been in a in a more stable environment and i probably would have done better scholastically 

338.03 339.24 A: yeah 

338.66 341.63 B: so and uh the odds are i would have 

341.39 343.81 A: y- you probably matured a little faster too 

343.51 344.56 B: (( well i don't know )) 

345.00 346.77 B: i don't know about that 

346.27 353.13 A: well [laughter] i guess depending on the kind of people you run into and the girls you meet and so forth 

351.66 352.59 B: yeah 

352.95 356.71 B: yes yeah yeah like that but you know i was on my own and 

356.93 362.04 A: okay but i i still say whatever it was it was better than i ended up with so 

361.55 363.14 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

362.05 365.88 A: now you got that through you sound like a fairly young guy how old are you 

365.27 366.33 B: fifty two

367.43 368.23 B: right 

370.14 372.62 B: [laughter] well i guess you could say that 

372.03 377.00 A: [laughter] i shouldn't use the word rut what i mean to say you've established yourself 

376.77 384.62 B: uh well no i think rut's the right word you know there's no there's the the i work at a bank in philadelphia and there's really nowhere for me to go

388.45 390.43 B: no no i can't uh 

390.55 395.66 B: in fact i don't think i can i can move out of my position for you know well different different reasons so 

395.97 397.20 A: i see 

396.59 404.20 B: i could transfer to another place in the bank i guess yeah but you know but you get comfortable where you area so it's complacency on my part i guess 

399.45 400.54 A: yeah 

404.25 407.30 A: uh-huh wha- what department do you work at though
