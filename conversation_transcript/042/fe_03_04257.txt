6.39 10.75 B: [laughter] um i s- guess we're supposed to talk about [laughter] 

9.99 18.62 A: about what we would change if we could go back and some point in time in our lives i guess um this is the first time i've done this so [laughter] [sigh] 

15.80 16.81 B: (( if we could go )) 

17.54 19.30 B: [laughter] me too [laughter] 

18.42 27.43 A: um oh well good so we're in the same boat [laughter] um i i think the thing that i would change is i would um not waste so much time 

20.51 22.06 B: [laughter] 

27.24 38.56 A: not knowing what i wanted to do and what i wanted out of life and [sigh] kind of floating through things um even in college like i didn't really know what i wanted to do [laughter] so i feel like i wasted a lot of time there 

38.86 39.84 B: (( [sigh] [lipsmack] yeah )) 

39.86 43.06 B: (( [sigh] i think that [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

43.58 52.91 B: yeah college is a big waste of time [laughter] [sigh] i think that i would even go further back and i would [sigh] 

45.19 46.93 A: [laughter] 

53.12 62.89 B: change [lipsmack] decisions i made when i was a teenager [sigh] and um how i interacted with my family and like choices that i made and 

57.00 57.97 A: mhm 

63.22 64.26 B: um 

64.71 72.11 B: you know with my family and how i treated them and um [sigh] you know subsequently how it affected our relationship 

65.95 66.80 A: (( [sigh] you )) 

71.94 74.52 A: right right i can see that too i'm 

74.45 89.32 A: i know i was a really difficult teenager so [laughter] i um [lipsmack] i was really nasty to my mother [laughter] and i'm kind of getting pay back now i i'm told it's the mother's curse [sigh] because she used to always say i hope you have one just like you some day 

77.58 78.64 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

80.84 82.34 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

88.97 90.89 B: [laughter] oh no [sigh] 

89.10 96.83 A: [laughter] [sigh] and i did [laughter] so um you know it i i'm kind of getting paid back for it but yeah i agree with you i um 

96.80 104.36 A: uh you know i would make some different choices there too and wouldn't it be nice if we could go back and change things [laughter] [sigh] but 

103.00 107.52 B: i know it would i often think about that actually but [sigh] how old is your daughter 

107.22 114.59 A: [sigh] um i have a nice year old and then i have a six year old and the nine year old is like nine going on thirteen so [laughter] 

110.70 111.59 B: oh wow 

113.59 115.02 B: oh wow 

114.50 123.51 A: [sigh] she has a mouth on her [sigh] um the six year hasn't really started it yet but i i mean i think that's pretty normal for girls to do that um 

123.34 131.25 A: [sigh] it's kind of part of breaking away from mum you know and as hard as it is on us [laughter] [sigh] it's just really hard do you have any children 

125.65 127.10 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

128.65 129.87 B: (( [laughter] oh my gosh )) 

130.81 132.96 B: [sigh] no i don't [laughter] 

132.31 136.53 A: [laughter] well i'm not trying to scare you [laughter] 

135.66 141.28 B: [sigh] well i mean i don't i don't think anything could be as scary as as i was when i was a teenager 

138.35 140.13 A: (( [laughter] okay )) 

140.92 142.56 A: yeah yeah 

141.66 147.79 B: so and i started i started pretty young it was pretty [sigh] i was just a really angry child 

147.12 155.86 A: [laughter] i um yeah i i can my kids aren't going be get by with much because [laughter] i know all the tricks in the book and [sigh] 

148.26 149.14 B: and 

155.82 170.17 A: my mum was not like that my mum came from a huge family and all her brothers watched her so she couldn't get by with anything [sigh] and i mean i you know i know all the tricks i know the sneaking out of the bedroom and [laughter] all those little tricks that kids like to do so 

169.66 177.78 B: [laughter] [sigh] well the other thing too is that i always [sigh] i mean i think that there are things that my family could have done to 

170.49 171.93 A: [laughter] 

177.82 188.70 B: you know 'cause i my dad was in the military or um this is his last year but [sigh] you know so he ran kind of a tight house and um [sigh] and my mum was raised in a really um [lipsmack] 

188.70 192.79 B: strict kind of roman catholic household and [sigh] so 

192.72 196.67 B: it was definitely i think there could have been better communication 

196.48 207.82 B: for all of us you know but [sigh] and so i don't th- i don't think that i'm going to have the same kind of [sigh] rules and stentorian kind of um [lipsmack] regulations as maybe my parents did but 

206.67 208.06 A: (( [noise] right )) 

207.90 214.76 B: i think that you know i i definitely i just wish i could have [sigh] you know i could go back and do something 

213.39 223.42 A: you know the things that i notice is that i especially notice this with my husband he he runs i i don't think he's totalitarian but he kind of runs a little bit tighter ship than i do [sigh] 

223.32 230.25 A: so i'm more lenient [sigh] so i think that a lot of times it's good if you marry someone that kind of balances you out as long as [sigh] 

223.53 224.56 B: mhm 

230.18 245.01 A: the kids know that you're a united front and they [noise] can't [laughter] they can't wear you down by playing you against each other but you know if he [sigh] says oh that's it i'm going to ground her for two weeks and you know you come in and you say well that might be a little bit much what about two days [laughter] you know and 

244.84 252.61 A: you kind of work it out you kind of balance each other out or something because i know [sigh] i would be way too lenient on 'em [sigh] if um 

252.40 265.44 A: if not for you know him balancing me a little bit and going look you know this was a really big infraction and she needs to know she can't do this [sigh] so um i think that's good if you can can marry someone who kind of balances out your 

260.38 261.27 B: right 

265.34 271.04 A: your parenting style a little bit so i hope anyway [laughter] 

267.23 268.86 B: yeah definitely 

269.95 281.29 B: they're well they're definitely a balance she's very [sigh] i think i mean i look back now and i think that there's no there's no other person that they could have married [sigh] you know uh i think it maybe it's kind of like 

278.45 279.37 A: uh-huh 

281.12 295.97 B: you know old fashioned cliche or cheesy or whatever but [sigh] because i don't really 'cause i'm really not the type of person that thinks like that i don't like i don't plan on getting married have children or plan on having kids but i think that you know they're a really good example of like how 

284.54 285.82 A: (( no i don't [noise] )) 

296.09 297.00 A: right 

296.27 300.96 B: [sigh] marriage can work and even when people are like really really difficult [sigh] so 

300.62 313.22 A: right well it's um [lipsmack] it's a it's definitely a challenge i've been married thirteen years and um and i love him to death but some days i just want to strangle him [laughter] and i say and i'm sure he feels the same way about me 

312.98 313.79 B: [laughter] 

313.00 320.90 A: and [laughter] and i think it's just you know uh you always have to work at it you can never you know get lazy about it because [sigh] 

320.66 329.84 A: it it is it's hard work to keep it you know to keep the marriage good and to keep it going and and it's not ever going to be perfect no marriage is but [sigh] um 

329.17 330.27 B: yeah 

329.64 336.85 A: you know if you love each other you can get past a lot of things so [sigh] so far it's worked for us knock on wood [laughter] 

335.11 336.86 B: (( how long have you guys been married )) 

337.14 338.64 A: uh thirteen years 

338.39 340.38 B: oh my gosh wow 

339.25 340.41 A: [laughter] 

340.42 348.44 A: so we got married kind of young i was uh i was twenty [sigh] and he was my high school sweetheart so we've known each other quite a while and um [lipsmack] 

347.86 348.93 B: (( oh mhm )) 

348.43 356.31 A: yeah we i don't know it's just kind of worked i mean other people we know that were like dating at the same time we were and married are all divorced [laughter] 

355.61 356.64 B: yeah 

356.08 370.20 A: [sigh] which is a little bit scary [laughter] but um but i don't know it just it seemed to work we both um we had a lot of discussions before we got married about our expect- expectations and [sigh] um that neither of us really believed in divorce unless 

370.00 381.60 A: you know someone was cheating on someone or something really major [sigh] um and you know that we would work through anything and kind i mean we just had a lot of discussions before we ever got married i think that made a big difference 

373.74 374.72 B: yeah 

382.10 383.16 B: (( [sigh] wow )) 

382.17 384.23 A: [lipsmack] so [sigh] but um 

383.41 389.28 B: [sigh] is that like is is that something that's more like re- religious based or religion based or 

388.30 396.54 A: um you know i i um i i wouldn't say i'm a religious person although i i definitely very firmly believe in god i'm not 

396.64 400.95 A: [sigh] i have a problem with a lot of religions because they look down on other religions 

400.79 401.86 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] )) 

400.91 403.04 B: yeah me too [laughter] [noise] [noise] 

401.71 407.72 A: but uh a lot of churches maybe i should put it that way not religions but churches because they look down on other churches and i just find that 

407.73 418.03 A: so wrong but um [sigh] yeah i mean i definitely have a really strong moral compass about certain things [sigh] and i really firmly believe that once you make that commitment you need to 

417.97 427.41 A: [sigh] try to work things out um and i mean there are certain situations if someone's beating you or or emotionally abusing you or cheating on you that's [mn] a different situation than if 

427.19 433.57 A: you're just arguing you know you can work that out you can get counseling or whatever but [sigh] um 

428.64 429.89 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

433.56 445.56 A: [mn] and he comes from he comes from a very strong religious background but he comes from a background that [sigh] his parents were divorced and his grandparents raised him [sigh] and he never wants his kids to go through what he went through 

443.67 445.19 B: (( oh yeah )) 

445.40 459.35 A: so um you know that's his that's his basis that he's coming from is my kids aren't going to go through this you know if there's anything i can do to help it and [sigh] you know my thing was here's the three things you could do [noise] that would cause us to get a divorce anything else we [laughter] can work 

448.27 449.25 B: (( [sigh] )) 

451.63 452.73 B: mhm 

459.18 472.17 A: out [laughter] so um so far he hasn't done any of those things so [sigh] we're okay [laughter] but um yeah i mean it's just you know you i my mum always taught me that you just don't make that commitment unless you mean to 

459.21 460.26 B: (( [noise] right [laughter] [noise] )) 

465.36 466.91 B: [lipsmack] oh [noise] 

472.00 485.33 A: follow through with it and 'cause it is a big [noise] i mean i know it's easy than it divorced it's now easier than it used to be but [sigh] to me it's just you know you're promising in front of your family and friends and [sigh] and we got married in church so we promised in front of god that 

485.09 489.38 A: we you know would be true to each other for the rest of our lives and 

489.62 502.21 A: you know to not be serious when you make that kind of commitment is um not a good thing [laughter] so plus it makes kids so miserable [sigh] um every child i know that's you know whose parents are divorced [mn] 

494.59 495.60 B: yeah 

502.02 510.07 A: in most case you know the children are really miserable i know there's some cases where the kids are probably better off but [sigh] um [lipsmack] you know 

508.31 517.81 B: yeah [sigh] it's probably because i never i never had that experience growing up so i but [sigh] looking looking around me at other kids like growing up they all 

512.74 513.66 A: yeah 

518.02 523.08 B: there were you know more and more there were people that just whose parents weren't together you know 

522.81 525.27 A: [lipsmack] yeah it is really hard 

523.75 526.65 B: or they were remarried or it was like their second marriage or whatever 

526.52 532.43 A: yeah yeah it's really hard on them and well i have an older half sister and [sigh] i know it's been hard on her um 

532.61 535.01 A: [lipsmack] you know just things like 

535.41 547.51 A: [sigh] [mn] you know and seeing me living with my dad and what or with our dad and knowing that it you know she's not living with him and just things like that i it it really bothered her when we were growing up so um 

547.34 547.62 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

547.59 562.42 A: she's quite a bit older than i am she's about six years older but [sigh] i mean just it's just really hard on kids i i've seen it first hand with so many kids and i it would be a last resort for me but [sigh] you know i got to tell you you know if he came in today and smacked me around i'd be gone 

562.37 564.06 A: (( [laughter] you know i mean there's just )) 

562.93 568.81 B: right which is also another thing that [sigh] a lot of women don't believe you know like they'll stay [noise] 

566.25 567.15 A: yeah 

567.16 575.76 A: well there's just certain things that you know i i absolutely draw the line at and he knows that i mean these are the three things that you can do [sigh] that will cause a divorce 

575.65 587.46 A: [sigh] and that i cannot forgive and other than that we can work it out so [sigh] yeah a lot of women just um well they think he won't do it again or whatever so [sigh] which i'm hoping after thirteen years i can't see him walking in and doing that 

587.23 598.65 A: [laughter] [sigh] but i guess you never know [laughter] 'cause [sigh] you you know people change and stuff but um you know he's he's a pretty good guy he's a hard worker and a good dad and [sigh] stuff so 

587.91 588.80 B: right 

598.47 599.89 B: (( mm [lipsmack] well [sigh] ))
