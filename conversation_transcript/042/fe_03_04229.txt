0.00 3.22 B: hello i'm evelyn and i live in brooklyn new york [sigh] 

2.74 6.78 A: [lipsmack] hello i i'm sandy and i'm in los angeles right now 

6.17 12.93 B: oh my god what a long distance [sigh] uh what would you do different it you had your life to live over is that the subject 

12.44 18.82 A: [sigh] well if there was one thing that you could do and go back in time and change [mn] 

15.53 16.89 B: yeah mhm 

17.18 18.04 B: yeah 

18.08 19.97 B: (( all depends upon on how old you are )) 

20.59 21.87 A: [laughter] 

21.21 25.25 B: [laughter] [sigh] well what would you do that you could change if you had to go back in time 

24.96 29.25 A: uh you first 'cause mine is like really personally [laughter] 

28.37 41.15 B: right well you're supposed to discuss [sigh] well i took violin lessons as a child and i was very good and i should have pursued that career [sigh] and maybe i could have made the grade as a professional musician 

41.59 49.11 B: [sigh] so instead i didn't go on with it and i took a commercial course became a secretary and i was the typist 

49.29 62.10 B: and that kind of work is not very interesting it's not very uh you know very [sigh] creative and if i had to go back in time i would have stuck to my violin taken more lessons practiced a little harder and perhaps made a go of things 

49.44 51.82 A: [noise] [noise] [mn] you could still learn 

62.16 64.08 A: but you can still do that 

63.43 68.02 B: i'm a little to old for that [laughter] [sigh] i'll be a hopeful i'm seventy eight right now 

68.74 72.35 A: hm oh you just mean like physically you can't do 

69.10 70.17 B: [lipsmack] so that's 

71.70 78.24 B: no physically i could but it's kind of late to first start a career in music at this age you know something you should do when you're young 

78.50 81.99 A: [sigh] well what i mean is you could still play and uh 

81.16 82.82 B: i do i do 

82.52 84.37 A: and play in an orchestra 

83.81 93.95 B: i do [laughter] i do that i do [laughter] amateur but as far as a career goes i couldn't possibly [mn] i'm not sure if i could have but i would have [sigh] at least made an attempt 

84.64 86.42 A: (( you know all that [noise] [noise] )) 

93.95 103.89 B: to see if i can go into it professionally and i also should have gone on to college because my parents encouraged me to go and [sigh] maybe i would have had something better than what i did you 

104.69 113.63 A: [noise] [lipsmack] well i had a i i i actually did play violin and i had scholarships in in violin but i had a um 

109.16 110.18 B: (( see really )) 

110.63 112.19 B: oh how nice 

113.94 121.71 A: [noise] [lipsmack] an incident where someone attacked me with a knife and my left arm was my left hand is injured [noise] so i had to stop so that 

119.65 120.51 B: oh 

120.81 123.73 B: oh how terr- so then you can't play definitely now 

123.71 130.16 A: um i can still play though it's very it it would probably be better for me to play but it's been very 

126.15 127.23 B: yeah 

129.85 130.79 B: yeah 

130.19 131.50 A: upsetting 

131.03 132.45 B: yeah how old are you 

132.54 135.85 A: [sigh] i'm thirty um three [mn] [lipsmack] 

136.05 141.86 B: oh so you still can do something as far as [sigh] career change [sigh] now what do you do now that you could have changed 

142.27 143.23 A: um 

143.39 150.55 A: [sigh] what i would want to have changed is is is [sigh] it's hard for me to talk about but it it's more 

145.89 146.69 B: yeah 

151.20 153.54 A: i regret and 

153.26 164.38 B: we all have regrets you're not a d- any different than anybody else [sigh] this is a common failing you know with people we do things and then later on we look back and we say why didn't i do this [sigh] so uh it's not 

163.31 168.23 A: [lipsmack] well i think for me it's more because i didn't want to do it at the time 

167.64 175.24 B: yeah well same with me i didn't want to [sigh] play the violin at the time [laughter] and now i'm sorry because you know things could have been different 

170.29 172.33 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

175.24 178.76 A: [mn] [sigh] and i got pushed into this decision when 

178.15 179.47 B: yeah 

178.86 180.93 A: i didn't want to and 

179.97 187.61 B: well nobody can push you into something that you really definitely against you know if it's truly [sigh] that un- you know unpleasant you couldn't be pushed 

187.79 192.24 B: so if you were pushed into something you must have been partially willing to do it right 

192.27 193.78 A: [lipsmack] well 

192.49 194.09 B: someway somehow 

194.03 197.35 A: i think i felt like i wasn't strong enough 

196.71 198.64 B: yeah probably 

197.45 205.57 A: to make it not happen even though [sigh] i really didn't and i think it was a moral decision where 

199.98 200.92 B: (( oh i see )) 

204.95 206.21 B: yeah 

205.71 208.53 A: i felt it was morally wrong 

208.02 209.83 B: uh-huh i see 

208.73 211.44 A: and um [sigh] yet 

210.39 211.93 B: oh i could see that 

211.55 214.09 A: still went through with um 

213.53 216.26 B: yeah this is for the job you're talking about or career 

215.98 218.28 A: [noise] no this is an abortion [noise] 

218.07 224.09 B: oh that's something yeah that i can understand [sigh] that i can understand you feel guilty about it of course [sigh] 

221.03 222.08 A: (( i i )) 

224.37 225.66 B: yeah 

225.13 227.55 A: [noise] it's something i i really wanted 

228.39 231.15 A: it to happ- uh the child so 

230.60 232.35 B: yeah 

231.48 239.79 A: and um [lipsmack] it it's hard because i i know a lot of people who [sigh] they tried so hard and 

233.51 234.31 B: yeah 

239.08 240.17 B: yes 

239.91 247.83 A: they'd have problems and [sigh] whereas for me was more because of my family and the pers- other person 

242.26 243.23 B: yeah 

245.36 246.14 B: (( yes )) 

247.34 249.62 B: yeah and you weren't married at the time i assume 

250.01 251.66 A: [noise] [noise] no but 

250.73 253.90 B: is that so then you did the right thing i feel anyway 

254.46 260.46 B: i feel you did the right thing but i guess you have guilt feelings about it and you think you should have done [sigh] had the baby right [sigh] [mn] 

260.72 263.42 A: [noise] [lipsmack] yeah i knew it would have been hard 

262.94 273.83 B: very hard and the child would have been handicapped by not having a father around so it's [sigh] bad enough because i have two children and i have a husband and it's bad enough that way but without a father [sigh] it makes it 

272.80 276.90 A: [lipsmack] i guess i felt like i could get married [laughter] um 

276.09 288.66 B: not that easily not that easily because a lot of men are anti you know things like that so i think what you did was the right thing but you feel that you could have done something a little different i understand that 

287.70 291.85 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] well what i feel is that my life would have been totally different 

291.16 297.16 B: absolutely but not in a better sense of the word it might have been different but [sigh] not necessarily better 

298.25 299.03 A: (( [lipsmack] [lipsmack] )) 

298.48 301.27 B: you would have been different yes stay home and tied down 

301.78 309.55 A: yeah i i mean i think it would be definitely my career would have been [sigh] different but i i i think it it's sort of 

301.85 303.08 B: (( yeah and yeah )) 

305.93 307.01 B: (( mhm )) 

309.76 317.04 A: different um because for me right now i probably can't have children and so that was probably was the only [mn] 

315.51 316.07 B: (( [mn] )) 

316.09 318.53 B: why not you're young enough 

318.55 319.62 A: um 

320.61 321.90 A: (( but the )) 

322.06 330.96 A: i took hormones right for it to happen and it it it there were some i had bad reactions to it you know 

324.63 326.22 B: (( yeah i see )) 

326.62 327.58 B: oh 

330.05 331.85 B: yeah oh i see 

332.03 333.31 B: so that changed 

332.05 337.33 A: so then i it led to complications and then everything so it it was 

334.51 336.10 B: oh my god 

336.42 340.39 B: so maybe what you're saying you're better off if you would have had the child already 

340.23 353.07 B: maybe in that case you would have been better off [sigh] but look we all have regrets and we all say we should have done this and we should done that but that's part of life you know [sigh] and if you had have done what you said you should have done it might not be the best thing either so [sigh] you know 

351.98 361.31 A: [noise] [noise] [lipsmack] [sigh] but for me it's like how do i it it really is i think if there was one thing that would be it because to deal with the sadness is 

358.05 359.53 B: yeah mhm yeah uh 

360.69 361.99 B: right 

361.36 362.76 A: very very 

362.69 363.83 B: yeah 

363.25 364.59 A: hard and 

363.85 365.61 B: how old were you at the time 

366.49 371.18 A: um i was it was just recently it was still i was thirty one 

369.39 370.17 B: oh 

370.63 379.21 B: so you were an adult and you knew what you know and yeah i can understand that [sigh] and how about your career what did you do you didn't uh make a career out of the violin did you 

379.34 394.27 A: [sigh] no no i had to change and i um i wrote and so i'm still in a career that's not very stable [laughter] and um so i i i write [noise] and [sigh] and that was a career where i could have a child and 

386.89 387.78 B: oh 

392.98 395.77 B: yeah you're a freelance writer in other words 

395.19 396.97 A: yeah i'm a freelance writer 

395.97 401.01 B: that was my daughter [laughter] from new york city [sigh] that's a very hard way to make a living 

400.65 402.89 A: [sigh] it is and 

401.76 404.91 B: and it's no guarantee of a salary every week 

405.01 408.10 B: which is nice to have but you work out of your home then 

408.29 409.24 A: yeah 

408.78 418.30 B: so that makes it easy yeah i see what you mean [sigh] i understand your point of view because things would have been different if you have the child but look [laughter] we can't go back right 

418.51 421.44 B: we have to do the best we can with what we have 

421.75 430.44 B: and if you're in good health reasonably good health that's all we can expect and maybe next time around if we get another chance we'll do things [noise] differently right 

430.58 434.15 A: [noise] [lipsmack] well is there another chance [laughter] 

433.15 443.24 B: yeah if there is we don't know right [sigh] no i can understand why it's difficult for you to speak about it but [sigh] this is what the job [laughter] this is what this requires is this your first phone call 

442.80 453.15 A: [sigh] oh actually [mn] my first phone call was also on a moral issue it was on if someone asked you to commit perjury on the stand would you 

447.36 448.39 B: not mine 

452.01 454.90 B: (( oh no [laughter] i wouldn't [laughter] )) 

454.08 459.15 A: would you do it i don't know if like everybody for the whole wee gets the same topic i don't know 

457.71 463.32 B: [mn] no i didn't i got that if you owned your own business what kind of business would you start if you had to start your own business 

462.96 469.20 A: [sigh] oh well that's more thoughtful i'm all these [mn] uh moral [laughter] 

467.68 470.32 B: yeah right this is your second in other words 

469.74 471.22 A: (( yeah this is my second one )) 

470.57 472.08 B: and you get one more 

472.09 476.22 A: [sigh] um yeah i suppose they'll contact me [laughter] 

474.32 478.65 B: yeah yeah so uh [sigh] they contact you 

478.74 481.62 A: [mn] [sigh] um this time i called up because [noise] [noise] 

480.46 494.89 B: i do too because i'm ready [sigh] ready to leave right now because here it's three o'clock and we're going to be uh going out for lunch yet so [sigh] i decided i was going to do the calling [sigh] but i can understand what you're talking about you know it's a very hard thing to do and [sigh] it's like you can't win either way 

495.24 496.95 A: [sigh] it was a very hard 

496.96 501.00 A: decision and i don't even know why i went 

497.76 498.84 B: yeah 

501.03 504.65 A: that way because i was really against it [laughter] 

503.64 506.49 B: yeah but you were forced by your family 

506.28 513.78 A: [sigh] um my my family were not there and um the father 

507.16 508.19 B: probably 

511.11 512.50 B: oh i see 

513.96 515.19 B: yeah 

514.55 515.45 A: didn't 

515.69 518.44 A: but i was going to leave the father anyway 

517.79 522.81 B: oh so that wouldn't have been too good for the child because [sigh] children need two parents you know 

522.86 528.17 B: even with two parents it's hard in this world with all the [sigh] dope and the drugs and all 

526.76 531.83 A: yeah i had another man who was going to marry me so um 

530.08 532.46 B: yeah i see 

532.11 534.93 A: and who knew it wouldn't be his so 

534.35 536.04 B: oh well g- 

535.08 538.47 A: but my parents were just very [lipsmack] 

538.83 540.10 B: yeah 

539.32 542.12 A: against the particular person 

541.63 542.86 B: i see 

542.67 544.32 A: (( although i wasn't so [sigh] mhm )) 

544.32 556.01 B: yeah well parents don't see sa- things the same way where children do [sigh] 'cause i have two children of my own and i know how it is [sigh] they see things one way i see things from an old older person's point of view 

556.06 558.06 B: and it can't always be the same 

557.93 563.82 A: [lipsmack] and it's hard for me because when i see all my friends and my [sigh] 

560.91 562.10 B: yeah 

564.21 565.77 A: (( my uh )) 

565.81 576.17 A: cousins and they all had children right at the same time where i was [sigh] i was they i mean it was right after september eleven so everybody wanted to 

569.45 570.74 B: yeah so like 

574.56 576.76 B: oh it's almost three years then 

576.52 585.12 A: wanted to get pregnant and have children so it was like a whole batch and it was around the actually around the same time 

577.09 577.69 B: yeah 

577.84 578.63 B: yeah 

579.03 580.20 B: (( yeah of course )) 

581.55 582.36 B: oh 

584.53 587.96 B: oh 'cause nine eleven struck here and [laughter] not your area 

587.53 592.97 A: and uh oh well actually i'm just i'm just traveling i actually live on the east coast [laughter] 

589.22 589.78 B: (( [mn] )) 

592.09 593.98 B: (( where do you live in the east coast )) 

593.81 595.33 A: [sigh] um i 

594.54 595.78 B: not new york 

595.47 596.76 A: yeah new york 

596.34 597.67 B: what part 

597.51 599.60 A: [sigh] um manhattan 

599.09 599.95 B: oh
