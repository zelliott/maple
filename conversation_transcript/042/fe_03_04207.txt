44.76 45.78 A: yeah 

45.13 57.90 B: uh i remember it was the t. r. s. eighty we used to call it the trash eighty and uh [cough] there was a whole set of people that really loved the computer and uh you know they were all they were referred to as computer geeks 

48.95 50.13 A: [laughter] 

57.65 58.92 A: yeah [laughter] 

57.99 67.04 B: um and uh and they they were one of the groups of people that of course were picked on um and uh and i remember thinking 

67.32 80.96 B: damn you know this this uh these guys definitely know what they're doing and uh this is definitely the future uh yeah of course you know it was it was easy to see back then but at the same time it was just as easy to uh 

73.92 74.90 A: really 

75.22 76.39 A: 'cause that's 

80.78 85.98 B: uh uh to shun them as being you know just another group of uh 

85.86 87.41 A: computer nerds 

86.79 91.74 B: well you know any group of nerds uh and it's just so di- when you're in uh 

88.68 89.72 A: okay 

91.61 105.32 B: when you're back in high school or even junior high it it's amazing how easy it is to just get sucked up in the uh in the sweep that uh you know when when everybody decides oh that's not cool stay away from that 

103.91 107.62 A: right that must have been bill gates too you know 

107.80 108.76 B: yeah 

107.84 109.80 A: back then how old are you

111.23 114.03 A: okay i i'm i'll be forty two this year 

114.07 127.98 A: and i tell you in school high school we we hadn't had 'em yet only the kind that had [cough] you know certain programs to learn certain things they weren't at all set up for internet or anything like that 

127.13 128.83 B: right 

128.08 132.69 A: and do you remember s._r._a.s did you grow up in new york 

130.76 131.80 B: (( s._r._a.s )) 

132.62 134.89 B: no boston originally 

133.13 134.07 A: okay 

134.79 141.08 A: well s._r._a.s and that was like right before computers and um we really didn't have 'em 

139.51 141.12 B: what is an s._r._a. 

141.37 146.41 A: i don't remember what that stands for but there were these like booklets that you'd go through and 

142.74 143.38 B: (( [mn] )) 

146.42 149.68 A: you'd have the answers they'd actually be there so you could cheat 

149.94 155.68 A: and you'd have to go through like a certain amount of them and then take a test and it was all like self study 

155.72 165.87 A: which was really ridiculous for especially someone like me that just went to the answers and you know answered 'em and [noise] i was i got a hundred and i was done [laughter] 

165.98 167.24 B: [laughter] 

167.24 170.65 A: um so tell me now with the computer thing what would you change [noise] 

170.43 172.18 B: oh i would uh 

172.45 184.89 B: [cough] instead of uh just taking two uh basic courses which is actually was the name of it basic computer uh and failing the first one and passing the second [laughter] which is really just the same class 

178.65 179.61 A: yeah 

182.90 183.97 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

184.78 187.64 B: i probably would have stuck with it a little bit more 

187.69 188.82 A: yeah 

188.33 190.09 B: yeah uh 

189.11 193.20 A: do you do you have a you don't work in the computer field or anything then 

193.17 202.41 B: [sigh] no but i use my computer you know for the internet for a few other things but uh just the you know i'm i'm starting to 

195.77 196.73 A: yeah 

202.42 214.81 B: make use of um microsoft word excel a few of these other programs now and uh even though it's been dumbed down for the general public um 

206.55 207.66 A: yeah 

214.95 215.95 A: yeah 

215.12 221.96 B: so that we can all get a better hold on it it's still a little bit it's just a tiny bit intimidating still 

221.39 230.74 A: it is i um you know the silly thing is it's cut and paste i still have trouble with even though i can use excel and at work i use peachtree for accounting 

223.22 223.79 B: (( [mn] )) 

230.63 231.65 B: right 

231.03 236.84 A: but um cut and paste still kind of blows me away i don't believe it's going to be there when i come back up 

236.44 237.58 B: right 

236.98 240.35 A: and it is but [sigh] it still scares me a little bit 

240.00 241.14 B: right 

240.58 248.09 A: my computer's a little bit slow compared to my kids' they're they're grown twenty and eighteen 

248.18 260.46 A: and um they have fast computers and they come over here to do something and you know it won't mine won't come up and do things as fast and they're beating on it and you know pounding it and it's [laughter] it's not going to help 

259.96 267.11 B: right yeah my line is uh i bought a laptop because it's a lot easier to throw out the window than a desktop 

264.49 266.04 A: (( [laughter] mm hm )) 

267.16 270.55 A: definitely my son wanted that for a graduation and it 

268.53 269.30 B: (( [cough] )) 

270.59 272.07 A: was just too much 

271.75 272.77 B: right 

272.17 273.06 A: (( you know )) 

273.32 274.48 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

274.94 283.12 B: so i guess that would probably be uh i mean that just jumps off my off my head right away as being one of the things 

281.23 283.87 A: yeah maybe you should have been a nerd huh 

283.52 285.70 B: yeah you know at least uh 

284.28 285.37 A: (( [laughter] )) 

285.71 290.90 B: uh well at least uh not to pre- not to pre- uh to pretend to be so cool [laughter] 

290.17 292.13 A: (( [laughter] really )) 

291.73 295.69 B: you know the older i get the more i realize you know 

295.24 297.01 A: oh i know 

295.77 297.69 B: i'm not i'm not that cool 

297.03 302.76 A: i know me either [laughter] oh my kids think i'm a geek anyway 

297.91 300.28 B: [laughter] 

302.69 303.64 B: right 

302.85 308.91 A: but um you know i definitely would have done better in high school and um finished my degree earlier 

305.85 306.51 B: (( [mn] )) 

309.02 312.46 A: because i um got pregnant first then married 

312.35 322.05 A: and i didn't have to get married i could have had my son myself and stayed in college and he was in the air force so we immediately moved to guam and 

321.94 327.67 A: i stopped my college and he turned out to be his name was mark too 

327.37 328.49 B: mhm 

327.86 334.08 A: he turned out to be a very controlling he wouldn't let me go back to school until my kids were much older 

334.39 340.46 A: and he wouldn't let me work so sometimes i think maybe i'd go back and change the fact that i got married 

340.66 351.72 A: right away instead of just trying to make it on my own but then i wouldn't have gotten my second son so i don't know for sure but i know for sure i would have done better in high school i did a lot of cheating 

350.18 351.38 B: (( yes [noise] )) 

351.78 354.92 A: you know we smoked pot and 

354.96 357.24 A: you know we did whatever we had 

355.94 358.86 B: did you say he did a lot of cheating or you both 

358.31 366.51 A: well i in in high school i cheated on tests i you know my best friend got me through the mess stuff i couldn't figure out and 

359.61 360.23 B: (( [cough] [mn] )) 

365.56 366.86 B: right 

366.69 376.43 A: and i should have you know i know now i should have just try i could have done it if i had tried harder but the group i was in all we cared about really was getting high and 

376.36 385.65 A: you know and getting high after school getting high at lunch getting high before school and that definitely blanked out my memory for being able to do good 

379.67 380.52 B: right 

385.79 390.10 A: and my son my younger son now is he's into that 

389.43 392.47 B: and and you can tell but you can't uh 

391.91 404.58 A: [sigh] no he asked me and i don't want to be a liar but i told him you know when i was younger shit i did it and look what um you know where am i know i do have a degree i'm divorced i'm on my own 

397.03 397.59 B: (( [cough] )) 

404.71 410.92 A: you know i'm i'm working in accounting i don't make a lot of money i i could have done things better i definitely could have and i 

407.91 408.72 B: (( yeah )) 

410.96 416.21 A: i blame myself but it was definitely the you know the drug use when i was a teenager 

416.33 417.37 B: wow 

416.36 418.46 A: that took my ambition away 

418.82 422.60 B: ah sheesh it's funny i uh i i um 

419.72 420.87 A: and i sure 

422.97 426.34 B: [cough] how long have you st- have you stopped uh using it [cough] [mn] 

425.92 429.64 A: yeah i i uh once i had children i didn't want to 

429.90 436.17 A: you know i wanted to be a good mother and i was a good mother when they were little and everything i'm still a good mother but um 

436.24 443.99 A: i've never been a disciplinarian i was never disciplined as a child my parents both smoked so it was completely condoned 

444.27 446.42 A: you know they let me do it they didn't care 

446.49 447.45 B: huh 

447.10 453.18 A: so i thought oh this is cool you know but actually looking back it it wasn't i wish i had never smoked with them 

453.59 459.72 A: and i wish they'd never smoked with me you know it just because i don't i wouldn't do that with my children 

459.75 461.11 A: no way 

461.16 464.57 B: right it makes it the set- the set up ma- it's just too easy 

461.56 462.37 A: (( and then )) 

464.08 471.76 A: yeah [sigh] and you know now well i don't blame them but i certainly wouldn't want my son to 

471.83 483.70 A: he uses it now and you know he i found out i found it and everything and he admitted it and i'm trying to get him to not but he's working he can afford it he does it 

484.00 497.11 A: but he's failing school he's got one he should he should be graduating but he's not going to because he's can't pass algebra he wants to go to summer school but he's paying it himself here in ohio in new york it was like five dollars for summer school 

497.21 499.31 A: in ohio it's a hundred and fifty 

499.88 508.12 A: so he has to pay his own summer school and graduate in january and he'll be nineteen when he graduates so that's silly 

503.47 504.41 B: (( ah right )) 

506.27 507.17 B: right 

508.16 511.55 A: i'm hoping he's thinking he's realizing you know 

508.99 509.55 B: (( [cough] )) 

512.09 518.82 B: [mn] yeah it's tough though i mean it's it's not [cough] if the penalty for it all isn't as isn't terribly severe 

519.10 519.89 A: nope 

519.10 521.02 B: you know if he doesn't uh 

520.75 522.17 A: nope you're right 

521.88 529.53 B: yeah then it's tough i myself actually uh still smoke um and uh 

529.59 530.51 B: huh 

530.67 537.27 A: i like it my fr- i have a few friends here that do and i you know occasionally do as long as my kids don't know about it 

530.79 531.92 B: interesting 

536.90 547.55 B: right i know i i um for it's it's a [laughter] ah it's it's such a rough one for me because uh 

548.40 553.51 B: uh i don't know it just seems like it it because it's so shunned 

553.63 554.57 A: yeah 

553.90 556.81 B: uh and it's so uh um 

557.07 562.65 B: uh everything because it's illegal everybody hides it um 

559.67 563.69 A: yeah yeah and it's not like we're shooting heroin 

563.77 565.46 A: or smoking crack 

565.21 569.30 B: i know i think that makes it all the worse actually 

569.14 581.92 B: for instance [cough] if it was just not shunned as much or it wasn't illegal and could just be [cough] enjoyed when it's enjoyed much like [mn] i bartend and uh 

581.74 586.18 B: and there's so many people that drink so much 

585.42 586.30 A: oh 

586.72 588.00 B: [laughter] 

587.28 590.81 A: and and that's addictive and that's that's very scary 

590.28 599.82 B: i know and and they're so proud of the jobs they can hold down and and there's plenty of 'em every now and then i i when i fi- the worst is when i find out 

592.00 593.40 A: and it's legal
