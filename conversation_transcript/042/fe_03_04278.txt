21.86 26.98 B: o- one to change [laughter] there's probably like a hundred things you would change 

26.73 38.44 A: oh yeah i'm sure there's a lot i think that for one thing [sigh] uh i took a long time to get through college and i think that what i would do is [sigh] uh i'd go back and try and finish a little bit sooner uh [laughter] 

37.21 38.31 B: [noise] ah 

38.48 48.40 B: think about the fun stuff buddy don't think of that think of like all the fun stuff you could've d- you know gone back to you know things that you should've said that you didn't say and all that stuff 

48.45 50.48 A: (( uh well what would you change )) 

50.15 53.81 B: uh everything i i mean there's pl- there's probably 

53.73 66.65 B: you know [sigh] there's probably not a day that goes by in in your life where you don't think ah i could have went one way or the other way i mean ever- every you know every every corner in life every hour there's a pivot [sigh] 

66.68 74.60 B: and and you go in one direction or the other an- and [sigh] you know what it's it's a crab shoot sometimes you got it right sometimes you don't get it right [sigh] [noise] 

66.92 68.07 A: sure 

74.97 80.88 A: yeah that's true that is definitely true i mean there's big things and there's little things [sigh] um 

80.89 90.60 A: i happen to be gay and i think that had i had the opportunity to go back i'd probably have come out uh of the closet a lot sooner than i did 

89.85 101.45 B: [sigh] er see you got to think of that yeah think about that i mean you know you probably had all the apprehe- -hension about doing it [sigh] and when you finally did it it wasn't that bad think of the times that you spent you know 

101.25 105.23 B: where you didn't do it you know think of how you would have had a little bit of a richer life 

105.34 120.20 A: definitely most definitely and [sigh] and that's probably the the number one thing that i would've gone back and changed and the thing is is when it happened when i actually did come out uh people were a lot more accepting than i gave them credit for than 

105.98 107.24 B: (( yeah )) 

119.97 129.77 A: th- that i thought they would be so [sigh] uh i think that more of it was in my head and i built it up to be this huge thing and it really wasn't so 

129.26 138.63 B: [sigh] [noise] [noise] er you know what in in the scheme of things [noise] most things that we build in our head are are not huge things at all you know 

137.98 139.46 A: i agree 

138.64 151.66 B: [sigh] you know life's er you know ever- every every decision that we all make and we all agonize over [sigh] it's not like we're a brain surgeon you know thinking should we tap this artery or tap that artery 

151.44 164.52 B: [laughter] you know it's like we're trying to pick out baked beans at the supermarket no big deal [laughter] [laughter] you know [sigh] but but we all kill ourselves over it [sigh] yeah yeah i i you know i would have uh 

151.52 152.44 A: (( uh-huh )) 

156.37 157.51 A: [laughter] 

164.54 165.45 B: you know 

165.49 175.87 B: i would have done a lot of things you think about even like in in your high school life you know i mean you you know your social life would have been a lot different yeah and i 

173.47 174.66 A: oh yeah 

175.10 182.83 A: definitely and the thing is is i spent a lot of years hating myself because of all that and i think that uh had i uh 

182.79 193.41 A: taken care of those things earlier that [sigh] i would have found that i would've had a lot more [sigh] uh peaceful life [laughter] than i let myself to have 

189.95 192.54 B: (( [noise] yeah but you know what it- it's )) 

193.07 199.90 B: the fact that you can you can you can look at that makes makes it worthwhile the fact that you realize that [sigh] 

199.49 200.36 A: yeah 

199.82 211.16 B: is what makes it worth you know makes it makes your life you know and and if anything you are having peaceful and all that stuff made you know was just the ingredients [sigh] that made you who you are yeah 

210.30 214.29 A: mhm [lipsmack] so is there one big thing that you would go back and change 

213.51 216.47 B: oh nothing big every day i would change something 

216.43 217.26 B: i would've gotten 

217.27 219.88 B: i would've gotten a lot more action in high school that's for sure 

219.79 221.13 A: [laughter] 

219.89 233.13 B: [laughter] [laughter] every day i would have changed something there isn't something you know i wouldn't change every day but you know what change is just that you know change is just a moment to c- you know 

221.29 222.63 A: [laughter] 

232.92 240.07 B: not that i'm an anthony robbins guru 'cause i'm i'm not [sigh] but you can change something 

237.54 238.65 A: (( [laughter] )) 

240.40 251.81 B: all you need is just a moment to change something you know you want to lose weight all you have to do is just say to yourself i want to lose weight and that [sigh] you know that's it you're you're on the road to losing weight 

251.37 252.72 A: yeah that's true 

252.24 263.27 B: [sigh] yeah so [sigh] yes i would've changed a lot of things you know that ev- every day there's probably little minor [sigh] decisions [noise] nothing that would've been earth shattering you know 

263.34 275.78 B: to make me like you know from the courses i'm on now to [sigh] being like an astronaut or something like that but [sigh] just the little things that would've made life a little bit more enjoyable like you know that's probably what i would've hit on mm 

275.87 281.65 A: mhm [lipsmack] well things like that and friendships that i've developed and different things like that that 

281.46 284.95 A: usually they become the strongest and become the most developed [sigh] 

284.82 298.85 A: right before uh one of us is moving away or something like that is going to happen and i always think oh why didn't i just extend myself a little bit sooner or you know why or why didn't we become friends sooner 

298.79 313.73 A: and uh i i think a lot of times it comes down to my ow- you know my own self esteem issues and [sigh] worrying that they're not going to like me so it takes a lot longer to build into those [sigh] uh friendships and relationships and uh well 

311.91 323.91 B: [sigh] self esteem sucks [laughter] you know it's not you know what there's th- th- th- there's guys that you know for christ's sake y- you've got self esteem issues [sigh] jeffrey dommer er 

314.12 315.49 A: yes it does 

324.02 331.14 B: you know eats people and he's okay with himself so you know if you're worried about like you know 

331.67 344.06 B: you know the little issues that you worry about with your self esteem in in comparison to jeffrey dahmer [laughter] you know you're a million times better person than he is [sigh] but we all do it you know we're worried about [sigh] 

341.59 342.53 A: oh 

343.99 347.02 B: you know what shirt we wear and we worry about you know 

347.11 360.47 B: [noise] how we say or how we're perceived and and and we wish we could change it but you know what the the there's a million times million people that are probably like worse off than you are [sigh] you know that really should be worried and they're not 

357.83 358.62 A: yeah 

360.50 362.43 A: yep i agree 

361.93 367.08 B: you know jeffrey dahmer is a bad example i don't know is he dead i think he's dead [noise] 

366.73 368.12 A: i think he is too 

367.73 377.66 B: yeah i think he i i think someone probably ate him in jail too but still [laughter] you know that's a guy he lives with himself every day like you know you be y- i you know you're i i 

372.54 373.93 A: [laughter] 

377.57 391.54 B: you're worried about how someone might react you know [sigh] to your preference or worried about you know and meanwhile [sigh] you've got a guy that's eaten somebody he's not worried about that at all [laughter] you know he's sitting or you know 

388.89 390.22 A: yeah 

391.73 396.07 B: duh it's crazy er you know maybe 

395.31 398.32 A: but then he's a little bit messed in the head as well uh 

397.59 398.98 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

398.34 407.29 A: er i would rather uh have issues and concerns about my self esteem than to uh have a high self esteem and be eating people and thinking that's all right 

402.60 403.76 B: [laughter] 

405.19 406.22 B: (( [laughter] )) 

406.39 416.59 B: well er there's a f- [laughter] fine line between a high self esteem and eating people but [laughter] yeah now look at that laci peterson guy you know the guy the mister peterson 

411.17 412.19 A: well 

416.01 417.11 A: oh yeah 

416.52 419.55 B: yeah he sits there smiling and stuff he probably killed her 

419.40 423.30 B: [sigh] you know i i don't i don't think he didn't kill her there's 

419.98 420.86 A: yeah 

423.11 434.56 B: an- and you know i mean i don't you know that's an example of where you're when you're so crazy you don't care about your course of your life and just keep on going [sigh] but you know 

434.65 442.30 B: a- and i don't think that's the right way either but there's probably like a nice mix where you just care a little bit [sigh] but then you don't kill yourself over the uh [noise] 

442.94 448.36 B: you know we all do that our li- life it's like a bad movie but you know why would you watch 

448.66 458.31 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] a a a thumb ball you know where a bad uh uh a scary movie again and again and again [sigh] but that's what we all do we take those portions of our lives that were scary [sigh] 

453.08 454.37 A: mhm 

458.21 467.54 B: or we take the portions of our lives that we anticipate being scary [sigh] and we do it again and again and again and again and again in our head [sigh] you know 

466.63 467.62 A: (( [sigh] well i th- )) 

467.48 476.74 A: i think within um the process of not actually being able to really go back in time and change things [sigh] uh i think that if uh 

467.55 468.32 B: (( [noise] )) 

476.54 483.65 A: we can uh put it into our lives now and [sigh] use it for good say for instance there's um 

483.45 492.58 A: things that you know right now stress me out and and there are life changing events in my life right now and they seem so important [sigh] and a year maybe two years 

492.03 494.06 B: [noise] that exactly time [noise] 

492.42 504.47 A: maybe even ten [sigh] they're not going to mean a dam thing and i'm not even going to remember them but right now they're totally causing my blood pressure to go up and i'm stressing and all that and if i can uh you know 

504.39 511.38 A: try and think into the future enough that and and the whole scheme of things within an entire lifetime this does not mean much 

507.62 508.97 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] that )) 

509.03 518.81 B: that's why i would only change the fun stuff you know look i would change like the fun stuff so i would have the [sigh] the the snappy comeback when i needed the snappy comeback or you know 

518.38 519.93 A: [laughter] yeah 

518.81 527.08 B: been wearing the right you know [laughter] you know made the move where i was supposed to make the move or showed up when i was you know

527.23 527.90 B: (( [sigh] )) 

528.22 529.26 A: yeah 

528.71 532.35 B: but yeah that's that's you know that's the way uh 

533.24 538.07 B: [sigh] we're all crazy man [laughter] that's the beauty of it 

535.58 540.10 A: [laughter] yeah everyone has their own issues and uh 

539.15 541.87 B: (( yeah [noise] uh [mn] )) 

540.86 554.40 A: [lipsmack] yeah i have a i work with a lady whose uh son is addicted to drugs and he uh was threatening the family the other night and uh they called nine one one and the cops came [sigh] and they shot him nine times in the chest killed him 

553.83 555.11 B: (( shoo )) 

554.16 568.07 A: and i'm sure that right now if you were to ask this question to his mother [sigh] you know she'd say oh if i could turn back time you know like li- you know there's things i would do to prevent my son from getting addicted to drugs you know 

561.11 564.84 B: (( now that's a real reg- yeah that there you go and and look at you [noise] )) 

567.85 580.37 B: [sigh] now that's a th- that's ya yeah and like look and i think you're kind of like me like you know you probably were like freaking out you know you probably freak out over like small things that are just so small in the scheme of things 

568.11 569.26 A: um you 

580.23 588.77 B: you know that's something that ya [sigh] freak out but then for her how do you know it's the question's how do ya you know what moment would you change [sigh] er 

580.31 581.27 A: (( uh-huh )) 

588.73 599.95 B: er she can't she couldn't effect that either because you know what with something like that isn't one moment stuff like that is uh is a a series of moments again moments again and again and again mo-
