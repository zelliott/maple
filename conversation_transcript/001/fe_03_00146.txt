0.87 6.52 B: hi my name is robert felty i'm a graduate student at the university of michigan 

6.24 13.70 A: oh hi robert i'm sharon bodie and i teach english as a second language at ah the university of pennsylvania 

13.74 15.15 B: oh great 

14.55 18.78 A: yeah i have a very g- good friend at the university of michigan though 

19.04 24.71 A: um one of my former students from a year ago so i imagine you're pretty cold these days 

25.12 26.31 B: yes 

26.37 27.13 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

26.68 30.74 B: [mn] um i would imagine [laughter] it's about the same in pennsylvania though 

29.95 37.43 A: [laughter] well i don't know i always think of michigan as very snowy [mn] anyway i guess our topic is about iraq right 

37.24 38.27 B: yes 

37.62 45.17 A: and i haven't really talked with anyone about this topic although i've been [mn] listening to the news and watching 

45.18 46.86 A: programs on television 

46.75 47.81 B: mhm 

47.19 49.36 A: um do you have any 

49.45 50.58 A: um 

50.90 52.78 A: background in this area 

53.74 55.09 B: (( [mn] um )) 

55.14 61.57 B: not not any expertise just ah what i hear on the news i get most of my news from n._p._r. 

61.22 65.99 A: yeah so do i [laughter] as a matter of fact n._p._r. in the morning and ah 

62.94 63.53 B: [mn] 

66.13 69.85 A: and then ah i usually read the new york times on the web 

69.99 71.41 B: mhm 

70.70 73.10 A: i'm fairly depressed about the whole 

73.12 76.54 A: situation i was at a march in washington in um 

77.10 78.53 A: [mn] at the end of october 

78.63 84.59 A: [lipsmack] um basically protesting any possibility of going to war with iraq 

78.99 79.98 B: oh okay 

84.40 85.62 B: mhm 

85.01 88.25 A: so i guess that's my sort of baseline 

88.50 93.65 A: um i don't think that the united states should be declaring war on another country 

94.07 97.23 A: and even though i understand 

97.29 100.56 A: and probably agree with the danger that hussein 

101.71 103.05 A: represents 

103.81 107.73 A: i i strongly disagree with our government at the moment 

108.17 110.01 A: do you have any particular 

110.70 113.02 A: background or feeling about that 

113.46 116.23 B: i would basically agree with that 

116.15 117.23 A: yeah 

116.68 120.92 B: [mn] the ah e- what i don't understand is 

120.79 132.59 B: now they're doing weapons inspections and they've got the twelve thousand page document and and they haven't really read it yet but w- we you know they say that they don't have anything but 

132.54 136.36 B: bush and his administration are are still skeptical 

136.37 139.09 A: yeah i think that you know it's really 

139.14 145.85 A: ah arrogant to say that it doesn't matter what it says or you know i- it's up to them to prove 

146.02 150.55 A: that that we're wrong instead of us pr- proving that we have something 

150.70 154.18 A: um i think if we have evidence 

154.55 158.65 A: then that should be shared with whoever else is going to be 

158.77 161.63 A: um in a coalition with us 

161.77 167.92 A: and that it shouldn't be so mysterious i mean there's either evidence or there's no evidence [laughter] 

167.54 168.72 B: right 

168.14 170.56 A: and ah to put it 

170.62 181.11 A: ah in the way that that i hear the bush administration putting it it it sounds like you know we we just want to g- to ah to go to war and it and ah 

181.58 184.70 A: doesn't matter if anyone agrees with us 

182.92 183.82 B: right 

184.64 185.89 B: mhm 

185.26 188.89 A: um i find that v- a very um 

189.07 193.29 A: [mn] i don't know dangerous and arrogant and i hope 

193.98 199.89 A: i what i don't really understand is why there isn't more objection from most people 

199.90 202.37 A: i'm not i'm not really sure 

203.14 206.70 A: um why more people aren't protesting 

207.31 219.02 B: [mn] yeah i don't know a- a- apparently the the polls seem to se- say that most people are or at least more than fifty percent of the the populous is in favor of it but 

218.98 231.02 B: the people that i talk to don't seem to be and that's you know obviously the academic community is somewhat generally pretty liberal so you would expect that but i also ah 

231.18 239.50 B: i am ah an assistant scout master with a boy scout troop and when i go camping with all of those guys most of the dads are 

235.00 235.86 A: uh-huh 

239.88 240.95 B: you know 

241.03 251.12 B: construction workers or whatever you know working class people and they they all think it's crazy too they're [laughter] they're not saying hey let's bomb the yeah [mn] 

247.93 259.35 A: well i'm happy to hear that i'm really happy to hear that i just spent um thanksgiving with [mn] my dad who lives ah and my stepmother who live in texas and 

251.32 252.56 B: yeah 

259.29 265.21 A: they've always been very conservative and unprogressive in my mind 

265.20 266.17 B: mhm 

265.24 272.76 A: so i i was really reluctant even to um raise the topic i i really didn't raise the topic 

272.28 273.27 B: mhm 

272.64 283.46 A: because i just feel that [laughter] that they're part of the group that says whatever the president thinks is right is right and and i just and of course they're from texas so 

283.48 284.21 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

283.54 290.00 A: and and they're republicans [laughter] so i just didn't think it was a valuable conversation to try to have 

289.97 295.28 A: but i do know it was very reassuring when i was in washington for the march 

295.25 302.18 A: that the people that were there th- the saturday that ah i was there just 

302.15 316.04 A: seemed to be so much like me you know m- more or less my age which is late fifties and [mn] you know and and not really very young radical looking people at all there were lots of children 

305.83 306.76 B: (( mhm )) 

316.06 318.50 A: [mn] lots and lots of families 

318.97 321.76 A: [mn] and i thought that was really wonderful 

321.83 323.12 B: mhm 

322.49 323.69 A: um 

324.45 328.58 A: [lipsmack] so i hope it continues i know that some more actions are planned 

329.19 330.42 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

330.58 331.71 A: (( around the )) 

332.10 336.14 A: i don't know seventeenth or eighteenth of december i forgot what that 

336.36 338.66 A: date i- represents and then again 

339.03 340.64 A: martin luther king 

341.67 345.95 A: holiday is a kind of target date for some more um 

346.00 348.26 A: gatherings i think in january 

348.22 349.31 B: mhm 

348.69 350.06 A: so i'm i'm 

350.25 352.49 A: i'm happy about that part 

352.71 354.15 A: and um 

352.72 353.64 B: yeah 

354.22 357.06 A: [lipsmack] i just hope it keeps building because 

358.13 363.47 A: i don't want to be from a country that just unilaterally declares [laughter] war on another country 

363.12 364.96 B: right 

364.06 367.87 A: and of course i'm very skeptical about bush from the beginning 

368.46 372.95 A: i i'm just really skeptical about his motivation for the 

373.51 374.45 A: the 

374.92 377.95 A: declaration against iraq 

378.04 381.01 B: yeah it it seems 

381.03 387.63 B: you know the weird thing the i was just listening to n._p._r. tonight and they had someone on who 

387.65 391.11 B: has written a book about the war in iraq 

390.63 391.77 A: oh really 

391.40 392.92 B: or or the you know the a- 

393.20 402.81 B: and but the fact that we've been talking about it so long that you can write a book on it [laughter] is just crazy you know 

402.55 404.83 A: yeah i think so too 

404.99 406.55 A: i i i do 

409.21 412.10 A: feel i guess that y- ah that you 

412.27 415.81 A: would have wanted someone to stop hitler in nineteen 

416.09 418.97 A: thirty or thirty two or thirty three 

418.86 419.77 B: mhm 

419.22 422.06 A: as opposed to nineteen forty five 

422.30 426.87 A: and so there's that that kind of argument 

427.88 430.14 A: does affect me i think 

430.16 431.07 B: mhm 

430.17 433.72 A: but i remember being in hawaii in the sixties 

433.84 435.81 A: and seeing all of the 

436.22 442.82 A: young men go through on their way to vietnam and and um i guess i was 

442.86 445.17 A: pretty conservative at that time 

445.20 447.98 A: and thought that we were doing a good thing there 

447.91 449.20 B: mhm 

448.56 449.75 A: um 

451.00 453.41 A: [lipsmack] which i don't think anymore i guess 

453.61 457.46 A: so i i think it's a confusing area 

457.38 458.56 B: mhm 

457.94 460.98 A: but i i really think that just ah 

461.69 465.08 A: without evidence and with- without support it's 

465.90 467.89 A: just not the right thing to do 

468.35 470.06 B: yeah at least with 

470.35 475.71 B: the vietnam war and the persian gulf war there was some kind of 

476.42 477.49 B: um 

477.67 486.33 B: you know conflict or you know but they ha- iraq hasn't even done anything they haven't invaded anyone or you know 

479.37 480.98 A: that's right yeah 

482.48 483.48 A: no 

484.69 490.08 A: it's been what eleven years or twelve years and [laughter] and they haven't done anything 

488.15 488.87 B: mhm 

490.97 492.47 A: except you know 

492.70 495.87 A: not follow our instructions more or less 

495.52 497.38 B: yeah 

497.40 498.43 A: so 

498.66 499.86 A: i suppose 

501.60 504.24 A: that i want the united nations to be 

504.37 506.06 A: the forum really 

506.18 507.90 B: yeah 

508.12 511.81 B: it it makes sense that th- that's what it's set up for 

512.05 513.61 A: [mn] well that's 

514.20 515.28 A: at least 

515.52 523.91 A: my feeling about what it's set up for i know that most of the time the republican leadership has ah really 

518.72 519.65 B: yeah 

523.99 524.95 A: seen it 

525.04 529.29 A: in a very negative way and so i can't really think that this 

529.64 532.21 A: administration [mn] will 

533.01 535.49 A: make a difference in that thinking 

535.51 537.17 B: mhm 

536.05 540.94 A: but i've read i i don't remember where that colin powell was instrumental in getting 

541.00 545.08 A: bush to at least make the speech to the united nations and 

545.37 549.62 A: and take them into account to the extent that he has 

550.54 555.11 A: but i think colin powell from what i've read is not really 

555.73 559.70 A: very [laughter] very widely supported in this administration 

559.83 560.93 B: really 

560.33 563.73 A: yeah i i mean that he's um 

563.76 565.83 A: [mn] sort of constantly at 

565.94 571.51 A: at odds with the other advisors um [lipsmack] like cheney and 

573.54 576.17 A: um [lipsmack] who's the secretary of defense 

576.64 578.03 B: um rumsfeld 

577.57 578.99 A: yeah rumsfeld 

579.21 580.67 A: so um 

580.91 583.49 A: so powell seems to be like a 

583.63 585.01 A: a much 

585.05 587.36 A: more statesman like person 

587.36 588.54 B: mhm 

588.03 590.92 A: and i don't know if that's true or not but 

591.34 596.89 A: i i have read from time to time about the disagreements 

597.00 599.18 A: in the advising about the 

599.95 604.79 A: approach to afghanistan a year ago and to ah 

604.91 606.28 A: to iraq now 

608.00 613.47 B: [mn] yeah it's interesting powell does seem to be a pretty level headed guy 

613.09 614.04 A: yeah 

613.61 616.29 B: for the most part he's definitely a lot 

616.33 621.07 B: better spoken than most of the ah the rest of the administration [laughter] 

620.16 625.02 A: yeah i think [laughter] that's my bias too um what do you study 

625.42 627.72 B: i study ah linguistics 

627.41 629.36 A: oh that's my background too 

629.32 630.29 B: yeah 

629.64 631.56 A: applied linguistics anyway 

631.39 634.48 B: mhm yeah i do germany mostly 

631.83 633.11 A: yeah 

633.89 638.67 A: do you mhm [lipsmack] yeah you're at the home of the linguistics 

638.86 644.29 A: all the all the parents and grandparents of linguistics seem to have been connected with michigan 

644.34 645.97 B: a lot of them did yeah 

645.26 652.10 A: yeah well you know it's h- really hard to be someone whose whole life has been devoted to [mn] 

654.13 657.92 A: communication and bringing 

658.34 662.00 A: people together t- t- to communicate with one another 

662.03 666.08 A: which mine has been as a teacher and as an e._s._l. teacher 

663.98 664.67 B: mhm 

666.20 667.35 A: um 

667.51 671.07 A: and then to to see the american government 

673.80 675.41 A: be so arrogant 

675.83 676.96 B: (( mhm )) 

676.33 679.51 A: you know my my whole life has been spent 

679.53 688.67 A: respecting other people's cultures and belief systems and languages and stuff and and then and then to to have this be the 

689.07 693.57 A: the government that's representing us is is really hard for me 

693.70 695.39 B: mhm 

696.22 697.17 B: (( [mn] well )) 

697.31 700.37 B: who knows what'll happen in two years [laughter] 

699.83 705.78 A: right y- who knows what will happen in two years but how many people you know could die 

705.78 707.93 B: wi- within two years yeah 

706.89 713.76 A: i- in the meantime i just i just have to think that we can make a difference in in 

714.47 719.07 A: protesting and bringing more light on to 

719.15 719.89 A: the act-
