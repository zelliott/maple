142.81 144.99 B: get so little time by ourselves

145.18 145.60 B: or 

145.93 147.82 B: you know just to kind of focus on ourselves that 

148.32 149.77 A: and to get to do something that 

150.31 154.87 A: you really want to do as yourself not just um 

155.19 161.29 A: but you have to go some place for a work related thing or because of a family thing or whatever that's a really good idea

214.16 214.66 B: and i

228.25 228.72 B: yeah 

229.51 232.46 B: i don't have a good answer for that at all actually 

232.86 233.93 B: that's a tough question 

234.58 235.21 B: um 

234.95 235.78 A: now i don't know 

235.97 237.62 A: (( )) 

236.34 237.85 B: i guess i could say let's see 

238.18 239.58 B: i could say what my favorite one is 

240.21 241.29 A: yeah that one's your finger 

240.76 241.31 B: let's see 

242.01 243.98 B: i think my favorite probably is christmas 

244.92 246.05 A: (( )) and 

245.19 246.25 B: because it's very 

246.53 248.07 B: it's very family oriented 

248.48 249.00 B: and 

248.83 250.24 A: and what el- what do you do usually 

250.54 251.79 A: with your family 

251.61 252.36 B: well i 

252.51 254.42 B: most of my family um 

254.62 255.64 B: lives in the midwest 

255.80 262.03 B: so either they'll come here or i'll go there and it's just the one time of year i know i can count on getting to see everybody 

262.27 262.58 B: so 

262.53 263.56 A: oh that's good 

263.17 263.48 B: and that 

263.72 264.19 A: yeah 

264.60 265.59 B: important for me 

264.80 267.01 A: and you're in a really good place it's probably easy to get 

267.11 271.56 A: i would've i would think that it'd be easy to get people to go there because it's such a beautiful area 

271.72 274.57 B: yeah they're all coming this year and they're thrilled 

274.46 282.96 A: yeah and getting away from whatever snow they happen to have in there part of the mid west i grew up in the mid west too and i know it can be really miserable sometimes 

275.04 275.46 B: so 

278.87 279.85 B: oh yeah 

282.27 282.67 B: yeah 

282.80 284.32 B: they like the weather here much more 

284.73 287.18 B: do you have any ideas about a holiday that you would make up 

288.22 288.85 B: if you could 

305.02 305.57 B: mhm 

307.20 308.79 A: good question i don't know 

309.82 313.20 B: who's do you do you have any other special holiday traditions 

313.79 316.21 B: any particular holiday that you do something special for 

317.26 329.16 A: um well let's see i certainly always do something with my family for thanksgiving in addition to christmas we do both which i think is nice to get together as kind of an end of 

321.27 321.62 B: oh 

330.11 334.71 A: um the year tradition thanksgiving sort of like a harvest 

335.01 336.59 A: bringing together everything 

336.72 338.11 A: didn't finish up for the year 

338.46 339.42 B: mhm 

339.12 345.52 A: and getting together for them i have a small family but i like doing a a really nice party 

345.96 353.31 A: or dinner kind of it's not really a party but a dinner just for my very small family but just so that we can be together and that's 

353.66 357.06 A: it's pretty traditional but we don't always do turkey but i think it's a nice 

355.01 355.47 B: yeah 

357.21 362.23 A: it's one of my favorite get together times and i like it because we do get together 

362.52 364.95 B: yeah it's a nice family oriented time 

365.17 371.90 A: we don't always do it right at thanksgiving because of the the problems with travel but we do it sometimes in ah november 

369.60 370.39 B: hmm 

372.04 374.46 A: and the idea is just to get together so 

375.24 376.92 B: is your family pretty spread out 

377.66 381.04 A: sort of i have a mother in the midwest still 

381.50 381.97 B: mhm 

388.82 390.46 A: she never comes to see me at christmas 

391.08 393.32 A: and i usually try to go see her at christmas 

393.44 394.32 A: but 

394.46 397.76 A: i don't think i've ever missed a christmas but it gets hard sometimes with work 

397.90 402.83 A: but uh that's a nice thing to do together too so 

398.53 399.20 B: mhm 

403.36 410.63 A: but uh and the the rest of the family our family are spread between california and illinois and holland 

410.75 419.83 A: and so it's kind of hard to get those people all together so we sometimes get together for a birthday or something in the summer um 

412.21 413.14 B: oh wow 

419.99 420.29 A: but 

420.41 422.63 A: uh around christmas it's hard because 

423.31 425.26 A: most of them um 

425.62 436.79 A: are my mother's generation i'm about the only one in my generation except my two cousins and they have a lot of kids so it's hard to get together at christmas because all those kids are going off doing whatever stuff 

438.39 439.11 A: so 

438.60 442.45 B: wow now is that some of your immediate family that lives in holland 

447.23 447.84 B: wow 

451.15 458.42 A: first cou- first cousins once removed and second cousins and both of my grandparents were the only ones that came to this country so 

458.73 469.55 A: ex- except for my two cousins who are here now all of the other relatives are still over in holland so and the other side of my family they there weren't that many of them and we 

469.71 471.41 A: they stayed in the various 

471.56 477.55 A: other countries that they came from like england and we don't even know who those people are anymore so the dutch ones we know 

475.98 476.57 B: wow 

477.13 484.65 B: yeah well where on the on the holiday subject were there any special holiday traditions that you had because of your mother's dutch background 

484.72 487.41 A: oh well why don't you i guess so one thing is that we 

487.51 492.74 A: open presents sort of early for americans we open them on christmas eve because that's the dutch tradition 

491.92 492.80 B: hmm yeah 

493.48 493.87 B: yeah 

493.83 499.76 A: course my mother thinks it's so good she'd like to extend it to a day or two even earlier than that 

500.41 508.50 B: my my brother and i would always do that to my mom we would want to open just one little stocking gift can't we open one just a little early 

507.04 508.06 A: yeah 

508.32 510.21 A: yeah that's a good idea 

509.26 510.28 B: so that kind of 

510.51 517.38 B: i guess that kind of became our tradition that we would open like a couple of days before christmas we'd start to get to open one stocking gift each morning 

523.94 526.00 A: have a tradition of opening presents 

526.72 531.86 A: uh on a day other than the twenty fifth the traditional christmas day even i think some open presents on a 

529.43 529.86 B: yes 

532.00 539.23 A: the thirteenth is a day in sweden and then things start early 

533.43 533.98 B: mhm 

537.86 545.47 B: yeah but when i was younger i lived in germany for a while and we would sometimes have gifts on the sixth 

543.12 543.68 A: uh-huh 

545.68 546.89 B: because that was saint nicholas 

546.21 547.34 A: on the sixth 

546.97 547.45 B: (( )) 

547.81 550.91 A: oh very nice yeah 

548.12 548.99 B: and december sixth 

551.61 552.49 A: that's uh well 

562.58 563.60 A: probably something that 

566.36 566.84 B: yeah
