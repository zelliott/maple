1.87 3.58 B: hi this is mike 

3.43 4.26 A: hi 

4.53 6.28 A: so what's your favorite holiday 

6.34 7.93 B: oh it's got to be christmas 

7.56 9.95 A: [laughter] no question 

9.69 10.96 B: no question 

10.67 11.84 A: no question 

12.36 15.44 A: [sigh] okay well that's mine too [laughter] 

13.52 14.36 B: (( [laughter] )) 

15.56 19.24 B: but as far as creating one i have no idea 

19.05 22.28 A: ah now that's a tough one [laughter] 

20.71 21.65 B: [laughter] 

23.28 26.92 A: should be should need to be something that um 

28.13 32.78 A: [mn] well i don't know the best ones i think are the ones that involve the kids 

32.89 35.65 A: [laughter] but maybe not in uh such a 

36.43 37.73 A: um 

37.21 38.67 B: materialistic way 

38.39 42.86 A: exactly [laughter] as the hol- as christmas does 

38.93 39.91 B: [laughter] 

43.37 44.67 A: (( i don't know )) 

44.31 52.78 B: hm yeah well y- it probably should be something that appeals to uh many people of different um backgrounds um 

51.93 52.90 A: mhm 

55.17 60.41 A: almost something a bit m- a bit more non uh or it should be non religious then 

61.99 65.40 B: probably you may i i guess 

66.98 71.65 B: i i guess what people get most excited about though is are things that 

72.03 78.18 B: also happen to divide people [laughter] like we have we have independence day which is very 

78.34 81.83 B: american centric we have we have christmas we have 

79.53 80.53 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

81.95 84.05 B: easter we have halloween 

86.11 91.87 A: okay they've got one thing in sweden which which is the country that i'm from uh which is uh 

92.81 99.50 A: a hedonistic thing actually a remnant from the nordic uh holidays which is midsummers 

95.01 97.22 B: (( um oh )) 

100.26 109.55 A: um which only celebrates summer but i think that makes more sense in a country where uh it's winter most of the year [laughter] 

108.39 109.60 B: [laughter] 

109.79 116.03 A: uh but that's just that's just uh sort of getting together n- no uh 

116.23 118.87 A: no gifts and stuff just eating uh 

119.13 123.29 A: pickled herring and um strawberries actually 

124.66 125.68 A: uh 

126.22 129.15 A: and that's sort of a favorite in sweden which would be 

129.96 131.42 A: a sort of non 

132.65 134.25 A: naturalistic anyway 

132.76 133.45 B: (( m- )) 

134.13 137.54 B: must help to have uh the entire country with 

138.05 140.14 B: nearly the same climate 

139.52 142.13 A: yes yes exactly mm 

142.21 143.23 A: that helps 

144.06 144.62 A: (( [mn] )) 

146.11 147.13 A: (( no really )) 

146.56 149.61 B: mm how long are we s- [laughter] are we supposed to keep this up 

149.31 151.76 A: uh [laughter] until they tell us to 

151.47 153.28 B: okay was it ten minutes or 

152.99 154.68 A: yeah something like that 

153.89 155.26 B: (( oh wow okay )) 

155.05 159.90 A: yeah so th- this was a sort of a not that easy topic i think um 

161.39 166.17 A: [sigh] so no no no clues whatsoever on uh making up your own huh 

166.82 168.94 B: oh no um 

170.50 171.87 B: i think i 

172.13 175.08 B: i agree it's gotta be something that you can get the kids involved in 

175.57 177.00 B: that they can uh 

177.51 180.28 B: they can learn about in school and uh 

179.30 180.21 A: mhm 

183.18 184.35 B: (( but no )) 

185.39 186.48 B: no ideas yeah 

187.74 191.34 A: no me neither it's something that you almost have to 

192.27 196.33 A: it's something that's supposed to be there and then that you miss when it's not there 

196.47 198.07 A: it's not something 

198.72 203.03 B: yeah you can't just start a tradition you can't just decide you're going to start a tradition well 

200.67 202.00 A: yes exactly 

202.81 203.59 A: (( [mn] )) 

203.20 205.88 B: i guess you can but but it may take a while 

206.01 207.17 B: to catch on 

207.04 208.88 A: yeah takes time 

209.80 210.64 A: uh 

210.72 214.20 A: i don't know i think i think holidays are so connected to 

214.52 217.33 A: you know the things you remember when you were a kid like you 

217.63 218.81 B: right 

218.21 226.65 A: easter and eggs and midsummer and strawberries and christmas and gifts and stuff like that 

226.94 228.64 A: oh halloween and all the 

230.32 232.20 A: um goblin stuff 

233.80 234.95 A: (( i don't know )) 

235.16 235.89 B: (( mhm no )) 

235.96 236.65 B: (( i )) 

237.55 242.66 B: suppose to start a new one we need some traumatic event that would everyone can remember and um 

243.12 243.88 A: (( mm )) 

246.64 248.65 A: there must be something that uh 

250.43 254.17 A: it's interesting really how how christmas is 

254.50 261.81 A: there are so it's celebrated in so many countries not just christian but others i mean in the in a different incarnation but 

262.30 263.58 A: still sort of 

264.45 265.00 A: (( a )) 

266.41 270.19 A: i know i read some place that christmas 

271.29 271.91 A: (( um )) 

272.24 276.74 A: well you know when when they christianized europe for instance it was uh 

277.40 281.60 A: [mn] they just took a hold of of the date for the 

281.83 285.76 A: the regular holidays that they already had and and just 

282.76 284.69 B: mm right yeah 

285.80 289.53 A: turned it into a religious thing that's sort of interesting [sigh] 

289.59 293.68 A: because i suppose that would be that that's just the thing they were in 

294.23 296.26 A: in that uh 

296.34 297.03 A: (( uh )) 

299.22 306.34 A: [lipsmack] they had to create something new but not really because people wouldn't accept getting rid of like the old i suppose 

304.53 305.83 B: yeah yeah 

307.59 308.16 A: (( [laughter] )) 

308.50 313.05 B: uh one thing um i thought was kind of funny um

315.44 321.66 B: actually have a christmas tree and decorate and i mean and they're they're singaporean [laughter] 

321.99 326.34 B: but they've just tak- adopted the western holiday even though there's no snow or or uh 

326.19 328.28 A: oh so they celebrate it in singapore 

326.47 328.05 B: (( or no no tradition ))

328.95 330.30 A: oh wow 

329.68 331.14 B: [laughter]

339.47 343.90 A: uh um friends from uh india um

345.43 346.74 A: and um 

347.71 355.10 A: i always bring them over because they think it's this thing with a with a tree they think is so funny [laughter] 

354.45 356.57 B: it is bizarre if you think about it 

355.99 361.95 A: yes i know taking in a tree and just [laughter] putting up a bunch of stuff in it 

357.11 358.45 B: [laughter] 

359.58 363.48 B: hanging hanging little little trinkets on it yeah 

362.86 365.49 A: yeah and then you just throw it out 

365.12 366.09 B: [laughter] 

366.02 366.89 A: uh 

366.95 368.69 A: waste of 

369.08 371.25 A: natural resources really 

373.59 378.63 A: [sigh] but the traditional american christmas only lasts for one day right so 

379.09 384.16 B: right yeah i guess in in some other countries it's a much longer affair yeah 

382.81 385.62 A: yeah yes o- ours uh 

385.65 394.89 A: lasts all until the sixth of january that's the twelfth day of christmas and that's when you throw your uh tree out 

395.78 399.54 A: it's so amazing here here you see the trees on the twenty 

399.89 403.29 A: seventh th- they're already out in the dumpsters [laughter] 

405.31 407.52 A: uh feels weird 

407.74 413.18 B: yeah it's when we if we had a fireplace then we could at least burn it but we don- we don't even allow that here 

411.11 412.02 A: yeah 

413.20 414.11 A: no 

415.51 416.91 A: they don't like it anyway 

416.66 418.52 B: yeah 

422.83 426.21 B: so what what holiday would you do away with if you had a choice 

425.88 431.10 A: oh do away with um [laughter] ah 

432.79 434.44 A: that's tough too 

434.48 438.30 A: but we got one well ours well 

439.32 440.38 A: (( [sigh] )) 

442.25 446.68 A: i don't know i think it seems more like there should be more not less [laughter] 

445.81 450.92 B: oh yeah at least ones that uh you take a vacation from work for 

450.68 451.78 A: (( yes )) 

453.06 455.68 A: exactly especially you guys need that here 

456.48 459.08 A: you don't have that many vacation days 

458.78 463.43 B: yeah so i'm really surprised to hear that you're from sweden because your you have 

464.05 467.13 B: perfect a perfect uh american english accent 

467.34 470.48 A: oh really thank you you can't oh you must be able to tell 

470.17 471.27 B: (( no not at all )) 

471.20 472.12 A: (( not at all )) 

472.25 473.23 A: (( wow )) 

473.83 480.89 A: thanks oh i'm glowing [laughter] oh well i've lived here for a while and i was an exchange student 

475.99 476.96 B: [laughter] 

481.14 482.55 A: a while back 

483.88 486.88 B: i would have guessed east coast but that's that's it 

486.25 488.55 A: [mn] yes maine that's where i stayed 

488.29 489.12 B: okay 

490.55 491.72 A: for a year 

495.07 496.99 A: no it's it's it's really um 

497.37 498.33 A: (( if we're gonna )) 

498.74 500.80 A: just a quick anecdote on something 

500.93 510.14 A: else [laughter] but it's really weird when i'm in when i'm in europe because everybody thinks that i'm an i'm an american and i don't get treated w- very well always mm 

508.21 509.57 B: mm 

510.72 511.86 A: that's a bummer 

513.88 522.19 A: so the singaporeans uh is is that a general tradition thing or is it just the friends you have that's uh celebrated 

521.17 527.68 B: i think i think that probably there there's a a a part of society that wants to be westernized 

527.61 528.69 A: oh yeah 

527.88 530.23 B: and so they they adopt uh a 

530.75 531.64 A: (( a lot of the )) 

530.83 535.33 B: lot of the western practices even if they don't quite fit [laughter] 

534.49 535.73 A: [laughter] 

538.30 539.96 A: do they do it uh 

540.20 546.12 A: uh would you i mean if have you celebrated christmas with them so you would recognize the way 

545.43 546.24 B: (( no )) 

546.40 553.04 A: no okay i was just wondering because i've i've heard about uh midsummer uh 

553.53 560.08 A: uh c- celebrations here you know in in uh w- in nebraska i suppose where there's quite a large 

560.20 563.77 A: swedish community and it doesn't sound anything at all [laughter] like we 

564.28 568.87 A: like we do at home it was just be interesting to hear if 

569.08 569.65 A: (( [sigh] )) 

570.70 575.78 A: seems like when things get translated they don't really come out the same 

575.99 578.41 A: or it's probably the memories that 

579.72 581.84 A: (( get diluted in time i suppose )) 

581.77 585.48 B: mm uh new year's seems to be pretty universal it the 

584.89 586.00 A: that's true 

585.61 587.89 B: different cultures seem to have different calendars 

587.80 590.28 A: yes but it's still celebrates 

590.49 591.59 B: (( and have yeah )) 

591.51 592.66 A: something new 

592.80 597.18 B: and i guess the the greek greek orthodox christmas is 

597.43 599.17 B: much later than the 

599.89 600.80 B: (( than the uh )) 

601.46 602.52 B: western 

602.13 603.15 A: (( the western )) 

602.59 603.68 B: (( christmas )) 

604.02 605.16 A: might be 

606.39 610.44 A: such a long time since i read about that in school 

615.18 616.26 A: yeah 

619.44 620.43 B: [laughter] 

620.02 630.62 A: that is [laughter] that is not a you don't have any religion at all in in schools i mean learning about other religions either it's it's it's totally banned 

630.83 631.68 B: really 

631.78 632.78 B: in sweden 

631.93 634.82 A: well no for you is it or or a 

633.93 634.96 B: (( oh )) 

635.00 639.40 A: i mean i mean in high school and up to high school i mean at university obviously you can 

639.97 641.35 A: study it but 

641.25 647.11 B: um yeah that well i mean there's there's world history and and there's 

645.11 646.65 A: okay yeah 

646.97 657.00 B: there's those aspects of world history that do get touched upon but but yeah as far as presenting any particular belief system i think it's that's pretty much a no no in public school 

656.96 657.91 A: yeah 

658.90 661.26 A: it's a bit sad really because it would uh 

661.42 662.81 B: yeah 

663.44 665.37 A: (( goes to something uh )) 

665.48 669.40 A: you get a very li- little hint about what other people 

669.78 671.29 A: believe um 

671.54 672.90 B: yeah 

674.63 676.77 A: always good for communication 

678.21 679.49 A: (( stuff like that )) 

679.03 682.74 B: yeah you have to wait until college to get that 

682.96 683.97 A: yeah 

685.17 689.61 A: we we get that from i think it's third grade and up 

688.71 690.83 B: (( hm )) 

690.74 692.78 A: so you get to know all or you 

693.33 697.93 A: you're supposed to get to know about every every sort of kind of 

699.81 700.75 A: fate 

701.79 703.77 A: (( or faith that's um )) 

706.26 708.14 A: (( [noise] practiced all round the world )) 

709.55 710.72 B: interesting well 

711.55 714.09 B: i'm sure some of that goes on i've even heard of 

715.46 718.41 B: (( a c- a controversial uh )) 

719.56 719.89 B: (( or ))
