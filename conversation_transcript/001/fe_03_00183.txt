81.62 82.29 B: yeah well

88.22 88.58 B: yeah 

88.71 93.02 B: yeah well i'm i'm i'm i'm canadian too but i've lived in the i've lived in the u._s. for 

90.74 91.59 A: oh you are 

93.63 94.67 B: about twenty years now 

94.96 96.25 A: isn't that funny 

95.10 96.29 B: but yeah in in 

96.43 100.42 B: in the u._s. uh thanksgiving is a lot more 

99.31 100.43 A: a big thing 

100.61 102.69 B: prominent than it is in canada 

102.11 107.08 A: i know i know it's such a big thing and the thing is that it's not the same date as 

107.17 108.06 A: in canada 

107.39 107.74 B: no 

108.29 109.18 B: it's like a month later 

109.22 113.15 A: exactly so it's a lot closer to the to the holidays 

113.31 113.80 B: yeah 

113.90 117.30 B: yeah yeah so it's almost not quite it's own holiday because 

117.17 117.72 A: right 

117.54 125.91 B: you know christmas is right on top of you yeah i don't know why it's so late i remember when i was a kid i remember hearing that thanksgiving was actually more 

118.03 119.54 A: it almost a preparation 

119.99 120.49 A: yeah 

126.12 127.70 B: and at the appropriate date 

127.95 131.80 B: in canada than it is in the u._s. because what it's like in october in canada isn't it 

132.11 132.45 A: yeah 

133.06 134.51 A: yeah i it's it's around like 

133.30 133.69 B: yeah 

135.01 135.87 A: mid october 

136.42 143.53 A: as a matter of fact we don't really we don't even celebrate canadian thanksgiving in quebec i think it's it's more of an english thing 

136.48 137.00 B: yeah 

141.82 142.53 B: yeah really 

144.15 147.09 B: i guess the pilgrims were english speaking 

144.22 145.44 A: (( )) 

146.10 146.73 A: yeah 

147.00 148.27 A: yeah well i- i'm not 

148.77 150.70 A: not that it it really shows but 

149.22 149.54 B: yeah 

150.82 156.35 A: (( o._k. )) so if you could create a fr- um what a- an ideal holiday 

151.17 151.51 B: yeah 

158.23 161.61 B: boy that question took me by surprise um 

160.85 161.65 A: i know 

162.18 162.86 A: eh well 

162.51 162.98 B: i- 

163.86 165.71 B: i don't know like well first of all it's 

166.06 171.61 B: the holiday has to uh be a r- r- reasonable number of days one day just doesn't cut it 

171.69 174.40 A: right exactly so (( it )) i guess 

175.10 177.26 A: oh you know when they asked the question i'm like 

177.75 178.75 A: i guess i would have 

178.86 179.88 A: christmas 

180.37 181.53 A: when it's warm 

182.54 183.25 B: there you go 

182.73 186.92 A: so i i i don't know i guess that i would have something similar 

187.16 187.63 A: to 

188.61 192.50 A: well christmas the christmas time um 

191.46 191.87 B: mhm 

192.75 193.21 A: but 

193.37 194.59 A: when it's warm 

194.75 197.67 A: you know let's say in the summer when everybody is off 

198.31 200.36 B: absolutely well you know um 

199.02 199.89 A: you know 

200.73 203.78 B: in europe they have you know i think six weeks 

204.28 205.52 B: of vacation 

205.57 206.02 A: uh-huh 

205.78 213.03 B: and a lot of them i do a lot of work with uh companies in europe and a lot of them pretty much just shut down in july and august 

213.69 220.10 B: because people will go away on a four week vacation it's government mandated the c- the people have to take (( time )) off 

213.71 214.64 A: really 

220.48 223.10 A: oh unless they lose it uh or otherwise they lose it 

220.82 221.23 B: uh 

222.31 224.66 B: yeah i mean c- yeah well no no they have to 

225.01 225.35 A: oh 

225.14 230.09 B: i mean there's no (( )) they they want to protect the employee so that they don't get overworked 

229.82 230.75 A: oh o._k. well that's 

230.86 231.35 A: smart 

231.73 232.45 B: so if if 

231.84 232.77 A: that's smart 

232.56 241.17 B: if the employee doesn't take their six weeks the company gets in trouble so the company forces them too so i'm thinking something like that maybe where we can get a whole week 

236.14 236.69 A: wow 

241.75 244.33 B: and the whole point of a holiday is to 

244.49 245.32 B: recuperate 

245.75 251.63 B: from your yearly work yeah you know just to just to revive yourself so that you are a good employee 

245.80 247.01 A: and see family 

248.05 248.91 A: yeah 

251.68 252.28 A: mhm 

252.46 256.44 B: but it's got to be a big chunk of time because one or two days you can barely 

255.80 256.16 A: (( )) 

256.72 258.15 B: you know recover from 

258.58 260.64 B: you know regular ordeals 

267.69 267.98 B: mhm 

268.53 271.65 A: your visiting friends and then you end up being more tired 

272.10 272.90 B: absolutely 

272.23 272.97 A: then 

273.08 274.78 A: then when you were working 

275.03 276.69 B: you need a vacation from your holiday 

276.60 282.43 A: exactly that you know that's sort of weird but um have you ever had have you ever um 

283.29 284.73 A: gone camping like 

284.83 286.51 A: been in in a camping um 

287.21 287.95 A: um 

288.59 289.14 A: (( )) 

289.82 290.87 A: we have something 

290.10 290.79 B: well um 

291.01 292.49 A: that's called the 

292.87 293.28 A: (( )) 

293.56 294.18 A: camper's 

294.33 295.30 A: camper's christmas 

296.16 296.89 B: (( )) what is that 

296.91 298.33 A: um it's 

298.61 303.97 A: well you know how p- some people just live for the whole summer in at at a camping 

304.38 305.63 A: um place 

305.81 306.18 B: mhm 

313.32 313.80 B: (( )) 

313.51 318.47 A: um as opposed to de- december twenty fifth and you know i guess that you know and (( )) 

318.59 327.22 A: a part from the tackiness of the whole you know camping thing um i guess that would be an ideal holiday because 

327.79 332.15 A: because it's warm and people are actually are a lot more relaxed 

329.55 329.92 B: mhm 

332.28 334.57 A: during the summer than in than in the winter 

335.01 337.88 A: i've never lived anywhere where it where it's warm where 

338.06 340.47 A: you know we don't really feel the difference between 

340.57 340.85 B: yeah 

340.97 342.37 A: cold and and 

342.54 343.22 A: and hot 

343.56 351.03 A: because i think that people are a lot more stressed when it's cold and they're walking faster because they're cold and stuff like that so having christmas then 

343.60 344.01 B: yeah 

351.34 352.07 A: um 

352.30 353.59 A: people are even 

354.16 354.52 A: stressed 

354.64 355.89 A: about the holiday 

356.45 365.72 B: yeah well i think that is maybe why it's uh shopping is so much more stressful because you got to deal with the snow on the road and you know the ice on your windshield and 

356.57 356.90 A: (( )) 

366.01 368.34 B: slipping while you are carrying all the stuff you bought 

367.94 369.94 A: oh my god yeah 

370.18 370.79 A: yeah 

370.90 371.73 A: i don't know 

372.20 373.65 B: so yeah out here 

374.02 380.05 B: you know christmas time y- really doesn't feel like i lived in in michigan and in minnesota for a while 

380.12 380.53 A: uh-huh 

380.66 385.31 B: and it just doesn't have the same feeling as it does when there is snow on the ground 

386.04 387.65 B: it is sort of all sudden it's 

386.11 387.77 A: do you have christmas trees 

388.48 391.21 B: yeah they you can buy christmas trees here and i guess uh 

388.53 388.98 A: (( )) 

390.13 390.94 A: natural 

391.81 393.26 B: yeah yeah 

392.43 393.06 A: wow 

393.96 395.37 A: it must feel weird 

396.07 398.59 A: the i'm sure they don't really last as long 

396.12 396.37 B: it 

396.47 397.56 B: uh it's different 

399.15 403.93 B: well it's also weird to see all the lights you know because people people put lights up on their houses 

399.21 400.06 A: (( )) 

403.88 404.39 A: mhm 

404.07 405.16 B: but you know it's you know 

405.38 410.00 B: seventy degrees out and your seeing houses with christmas lights on it just doesn't quite fit 

408.69 410.06 A: that's weird 

410.52 412.66 A: i've never seen that i know that that 

412.81 416.08 A: um my mom uh is is from haiti 

416.17 423.74 A: and she showed me a picture of her christmas tree like you know uh uh f- fr- from when she was young and i'm like 

416.37 416.84 B: mhm 

423.02 423.38 B: yeah 

424.13 425.98 A: well obviously in haiti they don't have 

426.33 427.83 A: um f- fir tree 

428.32 429.54 B: no no so wh- 

428.89 429.58 A: so 

429.80 430.50 A: it was 

430.04 430.79 B: what was it 

430.85 432.19 A: it was some kind of like 

432.35 432.63 A: like 

432.87 434.29 A: leaf tree 

434.59 435.38 A: um 

435.61 437.05 A: like (( with dec- )) deciduous 

437.71 438.33 A: tree 

437.84 438.34 B: mhm 

438.60 439.43 A: and with 

438.70 439.15 B: mhm 

439.53 440.02 A: um 

440.27 441.96 A: you know christmas balls in there 

442.62 446.83 B: (( no )) i'm sure i mean why not i don't see why it i guess it has to be like a pine tree 

447.16 452.25 A: it it felt weird i guess it's it's you know it's very very cultural but i'm like 

452.69 457.62 A: that that's not christmas that doesn't feel like christmas i i remember that was my first reaction 

455.86 457.40 B: yeah 

457.85 462.46 B: well definitely definitely you know when we grow up as kids the tr- christmas traditions 

462.57 464.87 B: definitely get ingrained to us so when you are 

465.11 466.97 B: when you don't experience them it's just 

467.13 468.61 B: something is not right 

468.27 468.94 A: mhm 

469.09 470.68 B: like the tree or like the weather 

470.87 471.72 A: and you think that 

471.89 472.29 A: that 

472.50 473.34 A: can 

473.49 474.47 A: anything that's like 

475.25 479.99 A: little details you know like the tree i mean the tree doesn't make the whole holiday 

476.95 477.76 B: yeah exactly 

480.36 481.23 A: but hey 

480.36 490.22 B: yeah yeah but like i remember the first time i didn't or i missed like the charlie brown christmas special well like whoa it just doesn't seem like christmas without having seen the charlie (( ground )) brown christmas special 

489.96 493.55 A: it's almost like there is a there is a magic to christmas 

493.73 494.31 B: mhm 

494.39 502.11 A: it's n- you know easter doesn't have that even thanksgiving doesn't have that but christ- you know christmas has all that magic that we 

494.43 495.70 B: yeah absolutely 

497.08 498.06 B: no 

502.51 506.78 A: grew up with so you know when y- when they ask you to invent uh 

507.06 508.30 A: a perfect holiday 

508.57 508.94 B: mhm 

508.64 512.71 A: i can't see anything more perfect than christmas unless unless it's 

511.36 512.53 B: it would be hard to beat it 

512.83 515.58 A: warm i mean that is the only difference that i would see 

513.87 515.40 B: i mean 

515.81 520.64 B: but look at all the uh look at all the movies that hollywood has made around christmas 

520.76 521.49 A: yeah 

521.09 522.56 B: you know it's a wonderful life 

523.03 524.89 B: uh i think you are right (( )) 

523.59 524.93 A: uh miracle on 

525.36 526.01 A: forty 

525.85 528.25 B: yeah yeah thirty fourth street fortieth yeah 

526.64 527.05 A: you know 

527.45 528.00 A: yeah 

528.54 529.17 A: wow 

528.87 529.22 B: you know 

529.39 538.16 B: all these all these films a- around christmas time have that magical feel so i think you are right it's it probably is the perfect holiday because you don't see a lot of movies made about easter 

533.16 533.72 A: mhm 

538.51 545.08 B: or you know about thanksgiving unless they're you know made for t._v. special about the (( waltons )) or something 

539.01 539.71 A: yeah 

543.28 543.89 A: right 

544.49 549.11 A: oh well there are some some easter like these religious movies 

549.28 550.62 B: yeah yeah 

549.63 552.60 A: that take away all you know it that don't really 

553.34 554.53 A: mean anything 

554.95 555.26 A: any 

555.66 558.88 A: i don't know i'd i guess they don't really mean much anymore because 

556.50 557.79 B: no they tend to
