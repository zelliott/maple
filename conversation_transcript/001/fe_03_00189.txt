208.54 211.23 B: oh i was just wandering because eh ah 

211.47 223.22 B: i've got from eh some friends some bosnia-herzegovina and slovenia i was just 

223.90 224.33 B: the 

224.91 225.84 B: uh-huh 

225.98 229.33 B: things are sounding very familiar what you were saying there 

229.60 237.27 A: [laugh] so i see yes so another question of the topic was about should we create a new holiday 

237.65 241.75 A: would we like to create a new holiday or do we have just about enough holidays 

242.19 242.84 B: well 

242.69 243.18 A: [breath] 

243.99 253.79 B: here it's sort of almost except for february and march almost it seems like it averages almost once a month ah 

254.06 254.51 B: i mean 

254.71 255.15 B: things get 

255.33 256.67 B: bumped around eh 

259.56 260.25 B: ah 

261.06 262.64 B: i don't know ah 

263.37 266.10 B: i kind of like the idea of having a 

266.27 270.03 B: a long weekend at least once a month but ah 

270.17 270.90 B: one thing 

272.74 275.05 B: i i think would be 

276.68 280.55 B: rather nice would be having something like a 

280.75 281.50 B: a 

281.89 285.95 B: a holiday dedicated to our heritage 

286.42 287.52 B: no matter what it is 

289.20 290.28 A: i can 

290.71 294.72 A: can you imagine a holiday that sort of covers that already 

294.93 295.47 B: eh 

295.50 299.55 A: ah not that i'm imagining but i think maybe you can attach it to 

295.64 296.08 B: well 

299.92 300.71 A: in some ways 

300.32 301.13 B: no well 

302.06 302.75 B: um 

303.07 313.12 B: for instance back in winnipeg every summer we had this one week two week festival called folkorama which was basically that 

313.23 314.10 B: ah 

316.47 319.10 B: ah that was a pretty good thing and 

319.48 320.58 B: i mean i think i'll 

321.37 324.12 B: you know really helped in ah 

324.83 330.08 B: unifying everybody and introducing everybody to ah eh ah 

330.34 332.18 B: the different diversity available 

333.20 334.97 A: ah there is a 

335.35 339.43 A: quite huge i could say holiday 

339.85 346.79 B: oh well well i mean we didn't have the two weeks off i mean we still had to work and that 

339.89 340.54 A: ah 

347.63 348.10 B: hm mhm 

348.17 355.89 A: i was just gonna share ah my experiences where i come from there is a holiday singing of 

356.09 363.04 A: music and of dancing and those are usually mostly but not limited to folk songs 

358.03 358.48 B: hm mhm 

363.17 365.29 A: and mostly folk dances and that 

364.76 365.30 B: hm mhm 

365.56 366.52 A: that turns 

366.76 368.74 A: out to be a holiday 

368.91 370.47 A: am 

370.75 373.94 A: because pretty much anybody who can 

374.21 380.50 A: from country go to those concerts and the culmination is a concert with a 

380.72 384.09 A: about twenty thousand people singing 

384.26 385.17 A: ten to twenty 

385.30 388.08 A: thousand singing on a huge stage 

388.30 393.74 A: open air stage and about the same number of people are spectators 

393.92 402.17 A: and sometimes singing along so that's quite a but that happens once every four years it's sort of olympics of songs 

401.66 402.86 B: oh really oh 

402.97 404.43 B: oh that sounds so cool 

405.70 406.35 B: hm mhm 

406.15 409.26 A: so maybe that is somewhat close to your heritage 

409.10 410.30 B: hm mhm well 

409.79 413.22 A: holiday but but i agree with your idea yes 

412.99 414.64 B: hm mhm 

414.22 415.64 A: that would be nice 

415.49 416.29 B: i mean like 

416.64 422.08 B: the united states basically is a land of immigrants i think it would be a great idea so celebrate it 

423.13 423.72 B: i mean 

423.20 423.80 A: eh that 

423.95 433.43 A: there are lots of folk festivals going on pretty much in every location maybe what you mean is just make them 

424.41 424.67 B: i 

426.95 427.37 B: hm mhm 

433.53 436.93 A: official at certain dates for everybody 

437.16 437.63 B: well 

437.78 438.05 A: [breath] 

438.16 439.73 B: i don't know i mean like this is a 

439.90 445.17 B: just an idea i was tossing out but i i think it would be really good if 

446.85 450.75 B: people were reminded you know that 

451.05 457.60 B: by an large we all come from somewhere other than the united states here 

451.20 451.80 A: [breath] 

458.45 462.92 B: and it might be a way of helping to break us out of our insularity 

471.31 473.68 B: that a few days ago versus 

473.85 474.37 B: ah 

474.92 479.73 B: what ah ah of the problems with 

479.92 480.39 B: the 

480.85 485.31 B: the president's kostanica's reelection for example 

485.53 489.68 B: i mean for instance you know i mean like 

490.07 490.70 B: it's a thing 

490.31 491.22 A: i 

491.02 492.90 B: it's a thing that i've just seen a little bit 

493.11 495.12 B: very often it just that how 

495.91 496.87 B: am 

497.77 499.13 B: gee i don't wanna use the word 

499.70 503.69 B: self-focused but ah that's about the best 

503.80 508.19 B: quick explanation i figure of it and something like a festival 

507.25 507.56 A: eh 

508.61 517.71 A: i think i see what you mean and not diverge from subject but the stereotype is that americans are a 

518.13 520.18 A: they live their work 

520.28 521.89 A: and maybe their politics 

522.27 532.09 A: while in europe people mostly live their lives and they also work and they are hard workers but that's not what they spend most of their lives 

532.16 532.68 B: hm mhm 

532.59 533.03 A: at 

533.64 534.12 B: hm mhm 

535.51 536.26 B: [breath] well 

536.51 538.49 B: give you a little story i mean ah 

538.89 540.43 B: first week i 

541.23 542.81 B: i after a 

543.01 553.07 B: came down here someone asked i someone asked me where i was from and i said canada and they quite honestly asked me what state that was in [breath] 

553.30 557.92 B: i mean after i picked myself up of the ground i mean like [breath] ah oh well 

558.24 558.51 B: [noise] 

558.24 559.56 A: oh i have similar 

559.16 560.18 B: [laugh] 

561.00 563.37 B: yeah but ah
