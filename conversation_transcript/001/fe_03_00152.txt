7.34 11.22 B: okay so our topic today is iraq [laughter] um 

9.34 10.19 A: uh-huh 

10.99 22.59 B: i guess first of all i've got a i know a little bit but i really don't watch the news like i should [laughter] and keep up like i should so i guess i don't know too much about it so but i'll let you start [laughter] 

15.70 16.67 A: uh-oh 

21.10 23.62 A: [laughter] well shall we change the topic 

23.35 25.83 B: um actually are we allowed to do that 

25.64 27.76 A: you know what i don't know but um 

29.47 41.33 B: i don't know i mean i i mean i know a little bit and i mean i i wouldn't mind learning about it [laughter] i mean that's my biggest thing is i always go god i really should start watching the news and reading the paper and [laughter] 

29.87 30.55 A: (( [mn] )) 

31.81 32.80 A: okay 

33.52 34.83 A: [laughter] 

39.30 44.35 A: oh [laughter] especially doing the study [laughter] you never know what pops up 

42.42 51.28 B: yeah yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] um well i guess i mean well well i guess what i'll start off with is what i do understand about it is i mean 

51.19 62.34 B: actually i just saw on the news last night i actually did watch it last night but it was because of the packers [laughter] um that they had gotten like these huge amounts of papers regarding their chemical warfare and all that kind of thing 

55.48 56.73 A: [laughter] 

61.28 63.97 A: yeah t- yeah twelve hundred pages worth 

63.44 65.25 B: twelve hundred okay 

64.26 68.30 A: yeah so uh i guess we're reading through it i don't know 

67.98 69.06 B: yeah 

68.37 69.37 A: uh 

69.87 74.84 A: but pretty much i mean what i think of of this whole thing is obviously 

72.34 73.16 B: uh-huh 

74.92 77.92 A: it's sort of like a son cleaning up the father's mess 

77.76 79.14 B: okay okay 

78.35 83.15 A: uh you know uh from back in the early nineties when we went in 

83.43 88.72 A: uh and helped out kuwait and we should've taken care of all this 

88.42 89.29 B: (( mhm okay )) 

89.18 90.21 A: to begin with 

90.13 90.98 B: okay 

91.54 93.05 B: yeah i mean i guess i 

93.18 98.02 B: like i said is is my ignorance i guess [laughter] is what i'm talking from but 

96.32 97.43 A: yeah 

97.50 105.05 A: well no i mean you know everyone has their uh you know can things be resolved peacefully uh 

103.72 104.71 B: yeah 

105.07 108.98 A: i don't think these people understand understand that 

108.69 113.39 B: right right it's um i guess my view of it is 

113.40 125.43 B: you know especially after the whole terrorism thing is we're not as invincible as we think we are [laughter] you know and i guess although i think that what we've done in the past that 

115.70 116.52 A: uh-huh 

118.48 119.61 A: right 

125.91 133.37 B: i guess i kind of think that things that the u._s. government has done in the past may have been what caused some of these problems now 

133.47 135.26 B: i i mean that's just from 

135.28 141.82 B: other people's opinions that i've heard and bits and pieces of things that i've heard on the news and um 

136.55 137.48 A: mhm 

138.69 139.59 A: right 

141.97 148.09 B: i mean ob- obviously i would prefer it to be all peaceful because i really hate to see a lot of innocent people 

148.16 153.51 B: you know over there and of our people getting killed i mean anywhere but i mean 

150.63 151.69 A: right 

151.98 164.67 A: yeah and and it's not just um the actual deaths it's the lives that are disrupted you know hopes and aspirations of the families you know kids going to school and all of a sudden they can't go to school 

155.83 156.65 B: yeah 

157.88 158.81 B: right 

161.45 162.41 B: right 

164.14 177.21 B: right right i think you know you lose you know kid young kids losing parents and stuff like happened in nine eleven and it's but i also don't want the threat to be out there for us either [laughter] you know 

165.08 166.63 A: um so 

170.96 172.39 A: right 

175.38 176.37 A: right 

176.44 178.29 A: and i and i think it will 

177.90 178.80 B: mhm 

178.44 184.90 A: um we can't undo the past you know if we sort of instigated things um i don't think 

180.70 181.72 B: right 

182.82 183.84 B: mhm 

185.64 192.75 A: so much we did i think it all it also ties back into the arab israeli conflict 

192.31 193.60 B: (( okay okay mhm )) 

193.03 194.73 A: and uh 

194.94 204.81 A: as long as you know every time you talk to someone in the middle east oh we like the americans we just don't like their government because you know they you know they kiss up to israel 

204.86 205.97 B: (( oh okay )) 

205.47 206.76 A: and so that's 

207.02 209.45 A: i think what it really stems from 

209.13 210.05 B: okay 

210.03 211.22 A: and 

212.18 218.47 A: they view america on the israeli side not on the arab side and as long as that 

215.97 217.03 B: mhm 

219.44 221.36 A: exists in their minds 

221.60 223.60 A: uh they'll keep attacking 

223.54 230.98 B: yeah yeah and i guess i don't see i mean to me i don't understand any of this stuff especially when they say it's 

231.02 236.64 B: you know well you know it's our god telling us to do this and they all it seems like they always blame it on religion 

236.50 237.83 A: yeah 

236.66 237.72 B: and i'm like 

237.75 246.13 B: why i don't understand why people can't be accepting of others people's religions i mean i figure as long as you have faith in something no matter what it is it's 

241.64 242.60 A: mhm 

246.17 250.22 B: doing good for you [laughter] and getting you through your life and 

247.32 248.57 A: right uh-huh 

249.02 249.98 A: yeah 

250.14 252.94 B: yours isn't the only right one out there and 

252.75 266.71 B: if you're but you but what i think is if yours is telling you to hurt other people and kill other people then that's not really a religion [laughter] at least you know what it what i call i perceive any religion out there is one about love and of acceptance of other people as opposed to 

258.68 259.68 A: that's true 

266.57 271.15 B: you know let's start a war because of religion i never understood that concept [laughter] 

269.90 274.10 A: yeah i guess it goes all the way back to the crusades or and and earlier 

272.11 273.12 B: yeah 

273.79 275.27 B: yeah yeah 

274.16 275.57 A: but uh it is 

275.68 282.04 A: it's bizarre it's almost unfathomable you know for people here in the west to understand how 

278.19 279.11 B: yeah 

283.17 287.09 A: extreme these views can be and how deep the hatred is 

287.15 288.13 B: right 

287.29 294.23 A: because over there there's people that never knew peace and it's almost a separate economy 

290.86 291.79 B: mhm 

294.00 295.43 B: yeah yeah 

294.67 296.22 A: and it keeps them going 

296.37 299.50 A: if all of a sudden they got what they wanted they wouldn't know how to act 

299.14 305.43 B: yeah [laughter] yes yes and actually i'm i'm in a class now where we were studying ghandi 

305.23 306.01 A: (( uh-huh )) 

305.42 315.29 B: and i mean the the people there worked so in india worked so hard to get the british out and once they did the hindus and the muslims started killing each other 

315.09 315.95 A: mhm 

315.34 327.98 B: and it was almost like they needed someone to hate [laughter] you know and it was like they worked so hard together to get rid of the british and when they finally achieved that and became their own independent nation it was like they hated each other and i'm like well 

317.78 318.74 A: yeah 

319.02 319.97 A: right 

323.77 324.85 A: mhm 

328.15 331.01 B: isn't there any peace there [laughter] or anything 

329.93 330.63 A: y- 

330.95 334.63 A: it's true it's i think some people can't exist without that 

334.41 335.25 B: yeah 

334.72 336.31 A: uh type of drama 

336.16 337.19 B: (( well yeah )) 

336.62 338.74 A: and it even goes back into 

340.11 343.00 A: something you know almost as bizarre as going back to 

343.07 344.13 A: (( uh )) 

344.41 346.49 A: high school or elementary school 

346.13 347.63 B: oh yeah yeah 

346.63 349.40 A: you know when uh friends are 

349.47 353.32 A: ganging up on someone else they need they need that extra person 

350.83 351.98 B: mhm 

353.13 354.00 B: mhm 

353.81 357.81 A: to gang up on or else that little small clique doesn't 

355.15 356.10 B: right 

358.12 359.26 A: exist 

358.89 360.45 B: right right 

360.26 373.98 B: i even i mean i even have kinda have that going on at work right now and i'm you know i'm in my i'm in my late twenties and i work with people who are you know all the way up into their fifties and they still have that where they have to have like one person in the office 

373.74 375.47 A: (( yeah exactly )) 

374.11 387.49 B: that that and i am uh right now i tend to be the one that's it and then i hired a student worker and um they started picking on her and she said i'm not taking this and she left and then it all went back to me [laughter] 

378.27 379.20 A: uh-oh 

386.90 387.92 A: wow 

387.33 389.24 B: and it was i mean and 

389.24 393.02 B: this was i even had a student who was you- who was you know

402.33 413.68 B: excuse me i've been in the work world for the last ten years [laughter] you know i'm not gonna hire someone who's fresh out of high school to teach me that [laughter] you know and it was like and she kinda got you know another like the 

408.88 409.88 A: (( wow ))

420.44 421.36 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

420.70 433.23 B: so but yeah and it's i mean so i've been on the end where god that's a lot of negative energy to deal with day to day and i don't un- and i feel sorry for the people who are in that position 'cause it's just emotionally and physically draining on you [laughter] 

426.25 427.38 A: mhm 

432.87 436.04 A: yeah it doesn't make for an efficient you know work 

433.53 434.51 B: so

437.05 438.72 B: right right

700.84 702.44 B: as opposed to 

702.83 706.21 A: well i don't know if the average american equates 

706.46 708.67 A: iraq with september eleventh 

708.54 719.51 B: okay 'cause see what i heard was that the whole reason we're doing this because i always i'll catch like a little piece of it and i'll like talk to my boyfriend and go now exactly why is this happening
