58.91 60.30 B: oh good good hm mhm 

60.30 61.74 A: i don't think that'll be a problem 

62.15 64.13 B: so if the check is in your name it's okay 

64.17 64.65 A: yeah 

64.63 65.38 B: okay good 

65.07 66.17 A: yeah that'll be fine 

66.13 66.69 B: oh okay 

67.54 70.35 B: so about iraq 

70.55 74.53 B: arming iraq or uh getting the priority of 

75.60 76.83 B: what what do you think 

77.32 78.03 B: do you think we should 

78.87 82.56 A: well i yeah i do think it should be a priority because i think it affects 

83.29 86.55 A: i think that it is a direct effect to security 

87.04 88.57 A: um internationally 

88.72 89.30 B: hm mhm 

89.78 90.47 A: and 

90.95 93.11 A: um obviously um 

93.57 95.10 A: the u._s. is a super power 

96.02 96.72 A: and 

97.30 99.58 A: i think that someone has to take the lead 

99.92 101.18 A: uh particularly 

101.45 103.37 A: since nine eleven has occurred 

103.56 104.11 B: hm mhm 

104.26 106.49 A: um i think in order to 

106.63 108.21 A: not only protect ourselves but 

108.45 109.16 A: protect 

109.42 110.90 A: other people as well that 

111.83 114.80 A: we need to do something to um 

114.93 116.94 A: aid in disarming 

117.56 120.11 A: someone like saddam hussein i think he's dangerous 

121.38 123.62 B: so do you think they're going to 

123.73 126.58 B: if you disarm the i don't 

126.76 129.24 B: i don't eh understand the 

130.12 130.77 B: the aim 

130.87 132.71 B: is it to just to disarm 

132.88 135.27 B: or is it to get rid of saddam because 

135.73 138.84 A: i don't think i don't think we have the right to 

139.54 142.79 A: try to get rid of saddam hussein i mean 

143.41 150.40 B: because he he he he is the you know he is he can re- rearm h- they can always rearm themselves you know 

143.43 144.62 A: i i think that he 

150.80 152.68 B: it's a it's just 

152.86 155.26 B: disarm them they will do it again 

155.11 157.71 A: i guess that's true but i think that 

158.92 160.01 A: it i think that it 

159.61 163.79 B: that's he is the ge- dangerous man he is the dangerous man 

162.21 166.55 A: yes he is a dangerous man i mean he's not he's dangerous to his own people 

167.05 167.92 B: of course 

167.95 168.67 A: you know 

168.13 172.34 B: he has been dangerous to my country too i'm i'm from iran 

172.40 175.67 A: yes i know i mean i know that he yes he has been 

173.50 174.49 B: he ki- 

175.08 178.11 B: he he has poisoned a lot of people in my country 

179.80 185.63 A: i just i think unfortunately if the u._s. makes its aim to get rid of saddam 

186.10 188.84 A: that the rest of the world is going to 

189.16 191.04 A: find fault with that and 

191.30 193.40 A: it may cause a lot of um 

193.85 196.59 B: no because he is dangerous to a lot of people 

197.11 197.84 A: i agree 

198.42 200.89 B: th- there are a lot of his neighbors look at kuwait 

201.67 203.17 A: i know i agree with you 

202.78 203.36 B: (( )) 

203.92 204.82 A: i agree with you 

205.88 206.21 A: but 

206.31 207.60 A: uh uh i think that 

207.96 209.82 A: the world at large d- 

210.04 212.72 A: the the u._s. a lot of times is seen as an ogre 

212.85 213.47 A: and 

213.59 215.63 A: you know as being too aggressive 

216.35 219.55 A: and i think that if we make that our aim that 

220.04 223.18 A: that's how it's going to be perceived by many nations and 

223.26 229.89 B: yeah i know but i don't i don't think sorry i'm to interrupt you but i don't think by eh 

224.25 225.52 A: i i do think i 

230.10 232.83 B: you know attacking iraq you get 

233.33 238.66 B: eh you have we can get rid of saddam it's by it's something 

239.10 240.09 B: it is 

241.07 242.85 B: not by attacking look did you 

242.99 244.94 B: did we get rid of bin laden 

245.47 246.76 B: did we get rid of bin laden 

246.76 247.21 A: no 

247.55 248.17 B: we didn't 

249.02 252.38 B: and and and we killed a lot of uh innocent people 

253.03 253.41 B: right 

253.68 256.26 A: well how would we go about getting rid of saddam hussein 

257.28 260.29 B: (( )) it if it is eh it just to eh 

260.44 266.16 B: you know i think the best people are the israelis for this they can do that very well 

267.46 269.44 A: they may well do it 

269.34 271.28 B: they won't do it 

270.80 272.31 A: no i said they may well do it 

272.99 274.72 A: they they may be the ones 

274.54 277.26 B: they they don't have to attack they they can go there 

277.73 278.47 B: penetrate 

278.65 279.42 B: and do it 

279.71 280.37 B: kidnap him 

282.23 284.01 B: they are very good at these things 

285.03 286.50 B: they're very sophisticated 

286.76 287.36 B: you know 

287.79 288.32 B: they are 

288.64 291.24 B: this is not a eh hit eh 

292.05 294.61 B: not a eh get rid of saddam 

297.16 300.55 B: and he is the force of all the trouble 

301.97 306.28 B: again attacking iraq killing a lot of innocent people it's like 

306.91 308.03 B: september eleventh 

308.28 308.85 A: i know 

309.22 310.11 B: the same thing 

310.38 311.30 B: it's the same thing 

311.82 314.99 B: because saddam is the source of evil 

316.40 317.71 A: yes he is you're right 

319.75 321.05 A: as i said he'd he 

321.37 323.24 B: to hi- to to the world 

322.60 325.42 A: for him to be able to do what he does to his own people 

325.24 325.69 B: yes 

325.62 329.17 A: i mean he wouldn't think twice about annihilating anyone 

329.44 329.91 B: right 

330.57 330.95 B: right 

330.58 333.80 A: i mean he just wouldn't he's a maniac 

335.44 336.23 B: yes sure 

337.95 348.09 B: so i i don't know i'm not a politician i i'm not i don't know how to do this eh no but that's why i have this idea 

343.90 345.44 A: i know well 

346.35 351.90 A: well i mean i personally have that idea too but i i think that 

352.69 354.55 A: politically it's another issue 

354.92 355.52 A: and 

356.45 361.32 A: you know like i said the u._s. is already considered an ogre for being aggressive and 

361.96 363.83 A: and a lot of um 

364.41 366.40 A: a lot people's eyes so 

366.97 369.94 A: you know it it seems that we're always having to 

370.60 373.78 A: be very careful how we do things and we always hap- 

373.90 374.34 A: to 

374.88 375.55 A: um 

376.72 378.73 A: position it correctly or else it's it's 

379.20 380.17 A: misunderstood 

381.49 384.25 A: so but yet everyone sort of looks to us 

384.58 385.75 A: to take care of things 

385.90 386.81 A: so 

386.91 388.82 A: it's kind of a double edged sword but 

390.00 394.30 A: but i mean we have to do something and he definitely is a threat 

394.60 395.55 A: internationally 

395.85 396.97 B: yes sure 

398.92 400.99 B: but i i don't think that 

401.11 402.63 B: that disarming 

402.80 413.37 B: him will solve the problem anyway he can hide things he can give arms to neighboring countries some arab countries he can do that he can do that 

411.67 412.14 A: hm mhm 

413.93 415.87 A: i'm sure and i'm sure he's doing that 

417.01 419.19 A: i'm sure that he is hiding he 

419.73 422.98 A: i mean come on the man submitted a twelve thousand page 

423.06 423.46 B: yes 

423.57 425.41 A: document i mean that's ridiculous 

426.73 431.34 A: you know uh you know and now he's apologizing to i me- oh 

430.53 435.17 B: kuwaitis now he should apologize to my country too 

431.47 432.51 A: yeah 

434.13 436.12 A: right i mean 

436.41 437.40 A: you know he 

438.99 440.76 A: want he'll do whatever he needs 

440.88 441.55 A: to do 

441.78 446.77 B: yes but i you know i'm against killing innocent people when you're after some other pe- 

446.96 448.72 B: you know just one one man 

448.76 449.13 A: right 

449.49 449.90 A: right 

449.86 450.51 B: kill hund- 

450.88 457.18 B: thousands and thousands millions of of innocent people eh just get one just get rid of one man 

457.41 459.99 B: try'd it before the gulf war 

460.85 466.86 B: couldn't do it by attacking you know that last time the whole world was with you 

463.41 463.89 A: right 

464.46 465.78 A: no that's a very good point 

466.86 468.30 A: right that's a very good point 

469.79 470.23 B: you know 

470.90 476.94 B: hm but i think israelis are very sophisticated and i think if you if america asks them 

477.57 480.60 B: yeah you know we in this country we help the israels 

480.73 481.93 B: israelis a lot 

482.22 483.39 B: we can ask a service 

484.38 488.77 A: i guess we could but 

489.89 491.58 A: oh lordy 

491.44 492.64 B: they're very good 

494.32 497.32 B: no they're very good at they're very sophisticated 

498.73 500.07 A: that's really amazing isn't it
