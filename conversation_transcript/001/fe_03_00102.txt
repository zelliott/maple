20.10 35.05 B: i actually had i i accidentally phoned up for two p._i._n. numbers and they said i could keep both so i [laughter] just talked to somebody about reality t._v. so now i'm like complete confused on what i probably already said i'll probably say everything twice so that's okay it's their fault for giving me two p._i._n. numbers 

34.74 40.47 A: oh [laughter] um i go to georgetown university in washington d._c.

66.06 77.12 B: yeah i stayed a fifth year for the masters and so sharon cariballo i guess is in both departments she does um well she do- she teaches like a linguistics course i mean a computer i think like ah 

70.48 71.49 A: oh really 

77.17 78.83 B: some kind of statistical 

79.04 81.20 B: linguistics i don't know what [laughter] 

80.92 82.04 A: oh okay 

81.59 82.63 B: but um 

82.28 83.64 A: that's interesting 

83.31 86.47 B: yeah i guess so so [laughter] 

84.41 89.10 A: [laughter] so how does this work exactly do you just speak for like ten minutes and they record it yeah 

87.84 98.36 B: yeah you just talk for ten minutes and then we're supposed to like i guess as much as we can keep to the topic of reality t._v. so all right so i don't like reality t._v. but all my friends do 

98.27 112.71 B: and ah [laughter] i know that the kid from big brother was from my hi- the kid that won big brother i don't watch it but he his name is eddy mcgee and he had one leg and he was from my high school so i was proud that someone from my high school won money 

112.40 114.08 A: that's impressive wow 

113.38 118.96 B: other than that i don't um i don't watch i watch the fifth wheel dating show once [laughter] in a while 

119.01 119.98 A: really 

119.07 121.03 B: and it's really bad [laughter] 

120.33 123.37 A: only things i watch are the real world personally 

122.83 125.15 B: oh no you're an m._t._v. person [laughter] 

124.36 134.40 A: yeah i'm an m._t._v. guy so i watch that all the time i've never really got into survivor we used to watch ah [lipsmack] temptation island actually my buddies and i like two years ago 

134.55 138.27 B: yeah my friends all used to watch every single one of those shows like 

137.32 141.62 A: we watched every one we'd all get together like fifteen of us and watch temptation island 

141.02 145.57 B: oh no [laughter] all of you in like harbin or something [laughter] 

141.74 143.04 A: (( yeah it was )) 

144.68 148.08 A: [laughter] all of us it was actually village v. we'd all get together it was 

147.68 148.93 B: [laughter] 

148.50 152.69 A: a lot of fun but yeah i'm actually i think i love the real world and i think it's a great show 

152.32 153.79 B: you do i 

152.92 157.21 A: i think it's like so interesting i it's like so pathetic i know but like i 

156.27 158.80 B: (( i know but [laughter] )) 

158.17 163.66 A: just get so into like watching these kids and like wh- 'cause they get so weird they're like my age and being on t._v. you know 

162.92 176.78 B: yeah i know i i can understand like my friends a- actually vill- i was at village c. freshman year village c. west and my [laughter] my friends would all 'cause i had the i kind of when i went on the dorm tour i remembered there was like one big room 

176.69 185.11 B: on in village c. and i remembered the number so i was very happy i remembered that number because i wound up getting the big room but it meant that everybody watched t._v. in my room 

184.74 186.46 A: oh right [laughter] 

185.22 190.28 B: from the entire floor [laughter] so everybody loved the real world and road rules and that was like my 

190.17 198.11 B: i like i like tried to leave the room every time it was on 'cause you know i think it was like overkill like i didn't like it and then like everyone was constantly like that was 

197.90 207.70 B: that and ally mcbeal those are my two least favorite things to like have people in my room for [laughter] but you know i understand like why someone would like it and because you know i guess like 

202.59 203.67 A: right 

207.82 212.55 B: it's all random people that they lump together and you see what they do and there's not like a script 

210.34 211.19 A: yeah 

212.26 220.25 A: yeah i really think the key is like if you don't watch the first couple of episodes you're not going to be into it like you really need to know like exactly how it started 

217.03 218.85 B: yeah 

220.09 227.93 A: if you don't see the first episode and see how everything like forms and relationships like that like you really can't catch on like half way through too much 

227.67 228.86 B: (( yeah and th- )) 

228.81 231.01 B: the i don't know if you know like 

230.90 245.37 B: which year this is from but the ye- the year that my friends watched was one there was like someone that called themself a lipstick lesbian and someone named genesis and somebody that [laughter] and some big black guy named i think like no not cyrus something no 

245.22 250.73 B: i don't even know but it was like the weirdest mix of people like some girl from alaska 

248.86 250.49 A: yeah they always [noise] 

250.81 254.37 B: the funniest part for me was there was girl from alaska who had like 

254.16 267.82 B: never done anything remotely like bad and then there was like this complete like rebel who called herself the lisp- lipstick lesbian or something [laughter] and the two of those i mean you know i even you know it was fun to laugh at 

262.69 264.60 A: (( [noise] the lipstick lesbian )) 

267.86 273.22 B: but [laughter] i would um i you know i um like that show [mn] 

267.88 268.85 A: yeah 

273.50 280.54 B: it kind of like that and road rules too like i think it just it kind of falls into the whole m._t._v. like kind of culture 

278.99 279.93 A: yeah 

280.16 289.82 A: it is it's all like i mean kids our age basically like i mean fifteen to twenty five or so we just get stuck watching m._t._v. and i always get road rules on and i always get like um 

285.26 286.97 B: (( yeah )) 

289.88 297.90 B: yeah like the carson daley link [laughter] his generation of people [laughter] [laughter] he's okay 

289.95 291.52 A: real world or i'm 

292.42 296.05 A: a big carson daley fan yeah he's the man [mn] 

297.38 298.58 A: (( he's okay )) 

298.36 309.98 B: he well he you know he's i he's okay because he's like he's not one of the people that's always go- like has to always talk about music videos no matter where is like you know like he has his own show and you know like the other day he had on 

300.05 301.27 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

306.76 307.66 A: (( right )) 

310.06 317.11 B: god oh um harvey keitel and he was cool he could talk to harvey keitel i like more like gangster movie people 

316.27 317.82 A: (( gangster movie people )) 

317.39 327.36 B: so i was impressed with his like a- ability to converse with harvey keitel [laughter] and say something other than like so what's songs were in [laughter] like your last movie 

322.35 323.17 A: yeah 

326.73 334.70 A: carson the thing i like i read articles on him he really like hates doing like t._r._l. or m._t._v. stuff because he's so not into like the teeny bopper scene and everything 

334.12 337.54 B: yeah he seems like he's he he knows he too old for it so 

336.51 343.74 A: [noise] yeah he's like way past that now he really just wants to get out of that scene like so badly but i think he has a contract for like another year or a couple of years so 

339.78 341.45 B: yeah 

342.65 347.62 B: [laughter] that's good that he's like making money though he's good yeah 

345.89 350.21 A: yeah he he's doing fine for himself i mean he's got his town t._v. show late night now so 

349.37 358.97 B: yeah [lipsmack] so i'm trying to think what other ah um last the last phone call we were tal- talking about i never watch the bachelor or any of those either but 

358.02 366.40 A: yeah i really don't not too like all the girls around here like always watch the bachelor but my there's a couple of my groups of friends like they always are so into that 

362.83 363.72 B: yeah i 

366.25 376.34 B: i just think it's so sad for those women that are all like after do they even like the guy like they hadn't seem him before they like went to the show so what if they get there and they're like oh my god i hate this guy [laughter] but you 

374.94 377.03 A: yeah it's so ridiculous 

376.42 379.70 B: know i want to win [laughter] i don't know it's kinda 

379.69 380.70 B: and um 

380.59 394.89 B: oh god but the show where they make you like eat worms that's like my least favorite fear factor and like they just need to get like a really obese person who will just eat anything just like starve the person for a day 

384.59 386.99 A: oh what's that called fear factor 

387.01 388.25 A: right 

392.50 393.61 A: [laughter] 

394.76 399.48 B: and be like okay go on the show [laughter] and they would just like eat the whole show and they'll win 

398.17 401.40 A: i know i can't believe some of the stuff they do it's unbelievable 

400.35 412.13 B: it's like will you eat the worm will you stick your head in a boxful of worms will you [laughter] will you go swim with the you know we won't give you enough air but try to do it in ah in sixty seconds or less 

409.96 411.51 A: i know but i can't 

412.36 416.09 A: some of the stuff they make them eat is just like ridiculous i can't 

415.96 417.76 B: yeah 

416.36 420.98 A: (( imagine putting that in my body [laughter] it's just disgusting i'd just throw it all right back up [laughter] )) 

420.37 423.57 B: [laughter] i know i mean i think those people are probably 

423.50 437.85 B: people that are either like just like thrill seekers or like so bored with their life that like you know [laughter] sticking your head in a vat of shit is like the best thing you could think of [laughter] so [laughter] i don't know though i don't know it's i mean 

429.37 430.44 A: yeah 

432.65 434.10 A: [laughter] 

437.81 444.53 B: i gue- like um the person i was talking to last said that she heard that um all these shows are going like kinda 

444.85 447.97 B: be a thing of the past in a couple of years i don't know i think 

446.56 456.95 A: yeah i think i think it might phase out pretty soon i mean i really i suppose like for me personally i can't see myself watching it too much like after i'm twenty five or twenty six years old you know 

448.83 450.60 B: (( yeah )) 

455.78 465.32 B: [laughter] yeah well me you know i i'm like unemployed after graduating from georgetown so i may have to look into [laughter] watching more t._v. 

465.51 466.61 A: yeah 

465.99 470.28 B: it's not a good job market good thing you still have another how many years do you 

469.22 472.30 A: uh no i'm actually a senior so i have like a couple of months 

471.72 476.66 B: oh god what are you business school better idea than doing linguistics so 

476.05 479.73 A: i guess so i'm kinda desperate right now [laughter] 

476.73 478.41 B: (( [laughter] )) 

479.03 484.68 B: [laughter] you know i like georgetown i don't know like are you from somewhere around there 

484.06 485.81 A: no i'm actually from new jersey 

485.46 492.36 B: oh i'm from ah long island so yeah i came back home after georgetown and they're like oh you mean you're not going to stay in d._c. i'm like 

486.90 487.88 A: oh okay 

492.14 495.70 B: i don't actually like d._c. that much like i- it's good for you know 

495.47 507.69 B: like government and some other stuff and i kind of am more of like a family person so i want to go home [laughter] and they're like well what kind of job are you going to get there i'm like well i don't know like new york and d._c. are both kind of big of the 

500.83 502.00 A: right 

508.14 514.64 B: s- scale of like cities but i think linguistics is the thing that's preventing me from getting a job and not the fact that i went home [laughter] 

514.04 515.39 A: you think so huh 

515.21 529.03 B: i don't kn- like ah i i i'm looking for a job in anything like i'll even do like just spanish or linguistics or um [mn] i'm teaching e._s._o. at night at like this to like illegal immigrants [laughter] 

528.41 530.06 A: are you [laughter] 

529.10 537.66 B: [laughter] just like for a part ti- i have like three part time jobs and tutoring some kid with a._d._d. and [sigh] i don't know i'm just trying to make money but it's very hard there was like 

537.45 549.08 B: georgetown was not helpful at all maybe 'cause the people in linguistics don't really look for jobs and they just try to get phds and like become a professor and i don't want to do that but they were no help at all 

547.01 547.90 A: yeah 

549.00 550.71 A: really that sucks 

550.47 562.97 B: yeah i hopefully like if you have like a you know a degree that's like something people want and maybe the business school would you know help give you a boost or like you know at least like have contacts for you 

562.67 565.57 A: yeah i mean we have that new recruiting 

563.14 564.14 B: because 

564.36 566.84 B: (( that's )) 

565.67 569.51 A: website which is pretty helpful i mean i've applied for lots of jobs and stuff 

569.17 574.45 B: pretty good and so are you going to try to s- c- like come back north or are you going to stay in d._c. 

569.89 571.03 A: yeah 

574.38 580.25 A: um i think i'm going to stay around d._c. hopefully i mean i only live in jersey which is like four hours away it's not really that far at all 

580.25 581.06 B: (( oh )) 

580.44 584.33 A: but um i i come from a really small town in jersey so ah 

584.46 590.40 A: if i went back there there would be like nothing to do so i probably i'll stay round here and maybe go to like new york or something like that 

589.78 603.57 B: yeah yeah it's you know i'm there's probably going to be a lot of people in your same like for me i felt like i went home and i was the only one that like left the area from like the whole department i'm sure like there'll be like five million people going every which direction like staying going 

602.98 604.00 A: right 

603.73 612.69 B: going west going north but yeah [laughter] i'm sure you'll you won't have the same like job problem i have and maybe like i think the economy will can't get worse 

613.00 615.28 A: yeah i was hoping it 

613.57 620.02 B: and reality t._v. says so too no [laughter] [laughter] i'm trying to connect it again at the end [laughter] the last per- 

616.10 617.33 A: yeah right [laughter] 

620.00 632.72 B: actually we stayed on the topic longer than like my other three phone calls i had like one conversation on illness and the other person's like ah yeah i think that's enough on illness i'm like how long do we have to ke- [laughter] no they 

632.04 635.80 A: yeah i know ho- how do they monitor how much you speak about it i mean 

635.46 643.03 B: yeah i don't i i i bet like part of the project they want to see like [laughter] how quick we [laughter] like forget about the topic [laughter] 

643.36 649.17 A: yeah um yeah oh what was i going to say so what kind of other topics have you spoken about besides that 

648.62 660.37 B: um let's see i well i spoke about this twice i did illness and there was one more what did i think was the worst habit and they named like smoking drinking overeating a whole bunch of things like that and ah 

660.59 670.51 B: and i picked smoking and the other person picked gossiping [laughter] i'm like okay [laughter] that's an interesting choice [laughter] i guess gossiping could cause cancer depending on where you're from [laughter] 

663.78 665.00 A: (( really )) 

667.25 668.41 A: (( that's funny but )) 

671.44 677.09 A: yeah i'm not the biggest gossip we don't really do too much of that [laughter] i guess guys don't really do too much of that but 

674.17 675.47 B: [laughter] 

676.53 686.36 B: [laughter] yeah so i i like this project because you get paid and they i don't know how many calls i'm going to get but i signed up for the thing where i could maybe get like twenty five of 'em i'm 

685.47 687.27 A: yeah i did that too actually 

686.74 691.52 B: like if you want to pay me two hundred and fifty dollars to talk i'm going to talk on the phone anyway so 

689.88 692.93 A: yes so how do you get paid by the way for this 

692.64 696.52 B: i don't know i'm just guessing they send you a big fat check right at the end 

695.95 697.48 A: you think so yeah 

696.90 702.76 B: i don't know i a- they and it said like you had to put down your social security number right if you wanted the money 

702.38 703.81 A: yeah i saw that 

703.23 708.44 B: so i didn't want to do it and them i'm like argh no money no project okay [laughter] so 

708.49 711.69 B: i don't know i think this is the best money making scheme ever 

711.38 715.66 A: it seems like it i'm just like i really just hope you get paid i wonder how it works you know [laughter] 

715.01 719.89 B: i know i know i kept thinking like if i did bad maybe like they would like take the money away 

719.14 719.89 A: (( yeah i [laughter] ))
