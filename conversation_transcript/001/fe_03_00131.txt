5.97 7.24 B: (( [mn] ah )) 

7.29 9.67 B: (( go ahead [laughter] you can go first )) 

9.12 10.79 A: so is this your first call 

10.36 11.39 B: yes

11.98 13.04 B: oh okay 

12.59 17.73 A: well let's see ah arms in iraq and all that fun stuff um 

13.94 14.79 B: (( [noise] )) 

18.56 22.58 A: well what do you think do you think they're hiding ah weapons right now 

22.01 27.41 B: um [sigh] yes i i do think they're hiding um generally i think that 

27.73 39.22 B: ah we have ulterior motives [sigh] in in our policy about iraq right now i mean i really don't even think it's about weapons at all i think it's like a personal vendetta 

38.89 42.59 A: well as they said after all this is the man who tried to kill my dad 

42.00 46.43 B: exactly [laughter] i mean that's like the most unprofessional ah 

46.07 52.07 A: but it's nice to b- to hear it said let's be honest i mean you know i i'd rather he said it 

48.81 49.69 B: yeah 

49.95 50.86 B: yeah 

51.86 53.09 B: right 

52.49 53.97 A: then we all know 

53.68 55.84 B: right exactly that's true 

54.80 55.63 A: you know 

55.68 57.39 A: it- at least he's up front you 

57.19 58.26 B: that's true 

57.75 59.18 A: (( could hardly blame him )) 

58.92 67.92 B: [lipsmack] right but it's you know you'd hope he'd have a little [sigh] less ah emotional involvement i i i just feel like 

59.20 59.76 A: (( you )) 

67.74 75.75 B: i don't i don't feel like we're getting the whole truth of what's going on and i i um i feel like we're getting yanked around by the press [lipsmack] 

74.36 82.99 A: know oh i don't think either side ever tells you the whole truth [laughter] i mean government as a as a general rule never tells the populous everything 

77.51 78.57 B: yeah 

82.59 83.66 B: yeah 

83.07 87.87 A: i have a a friend who's husband is working for the military right now 

87.68 98.29 A: he's in charge or he's going to be in charge of the briefings for that area in the war room and she says he she comes home and she finds a note on the cabinet that says you know 

91.62 92.55 B: huh 

98.30 108.04 A: ah i'm leaving i'll be back in a few weeks and she won't hear one word and when he comes back he can't say anything i mean her own husband not a word 

101.69 102.89 B: oh my gosh 

106.24 108.28 B: oh my gosh 

108.37 116.79 A: but you know she's she says well i i guess he needs to go um [laughter] you cross your fingers and you hope it was necessary 

116.52 123.89 B: oh that's i [mn] i was listening to m._p._r. today and i i was listening to um kofi annan 

117.56 118.27 A: (( so )) 

121.01 121.80 A: mhm 

123.88 137.88 B: telling a telling um saying you know i hope that everyone can let us let the officers do their job and um let the inspectors go thoroughly through everything and [mn] i think he's really [lipsmack] 

138.17 143.13 B: i really respect him a lot um when i listen to him talk i feel like he's um 

143.50 146.29 B: he's kind of an even keel you know 

146.62 155.72 B: um [sigh] th- i i think the inspections i mean i don't think i'm not sure it will work [laughter] i don't think we'll find any- i don't think they'll find anything 

154.27 167.08 A: they ha- the- there's so much room to hide things but at the same time i mean i think we've got generally equipment that's probably more technologically advanced than there's so hopefully our sniffing 

164.52 165.59 B: right 

167.22 173.50 A: ah machines are better than they are at hiding but it'd be nice if they didn't find anything 'cause there wasn't anything 

170.10 170.95 B: (( yeah )) 

173.10 174.10 B: right 

173.70 181.71 A: i just i think either we're not going to find it 'cause they hid it too well or we're going to find it [mn] there's probably something there 

179.25 180.34 B: right 

181.37 182.67 B: [mn] see 

181.83 184.31 A: especially with all the palaces 

183.64 187.44 B: ah yeah i don't think we'll find it i mean i just i think that they 

187.64 197.89 B: they know where the inspectors are there's like seventeen inspectors it's like they're they know where they are and even if they do the surprise visit like they did the other day you know they're gonna 

198.16 200.96 B: they're they're gonna hide it you know 

199.87 204.27 A: although some of the sniffing stuff can tell if it's been there within 

204.23 217.65 A: even months i mean it's it's because the stuff has ha- the a lot of the things they use have half life and the equipment can say well within the past three months you had this grade of plutonium here 

205.19 206.31 B: huh 

217.63 218.62 B: huh 

217.87 219.39 A: and we can tell 

218.91 219.94 B: right 

219.43 234.38 A: so although some of that stuff has valid uses but you know like ah there was one plant over there when they did the inspections the last time all those years ago there was a plant that they said they did animal vaccines at 

234.44 248.98 A: but when you looked at how much growing medium they had to grow the stuff to make the animal vaccines a plant of something like five times that size in the united states would have had one tenth of the amount of growing medium 

248.81 250.03 B: (( mhm )) 

249.40 253.45 A: and you start to exactly mhm [laughter] 

251.84 253.97 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

253.57 259.13 A: and exactly how many vaccine you know how much vaccine do you make ah well we make this much 

259.20 260.61 A: ah ha 

260.13 261.29 B: right 

261.37 262.39 B: right 

261.50 263.11 A: you know it it doesn't 

262.72 267.89 B: [mn] but if you think about like if you reversed the situation i mean 

268.03 281.23 B: [lipsmack] we we feel like we have the right to judge this country you know i mean if we were like okay inspectors are coming here are we going to show them everything we have there's no way there's no way that we'd show anybody 

280.59 287.13 A: but then again we don't generally run around trying to take over countries that often 

286.96 288.91 B: right i mean i i 

288.01 298.06 A: i we we come in when we f- wh- not always when we have to i mean i think sometimes where places unnecessarily but at the same time [sigh] we don't go let's annex canada 

297.85 298.88 B: right 

298.66 301.96 A: you know we like your natural resources you're ours 

301.36 303.27 B: yeah i 

302.55 308.19 A: so we're if we have a few things we're not telling about what of it i- it's 

306.70 319.99 B: right [sigh] i mean i i i do think we're right okay [laughter] but um but i do feel like we don't ah we don't have the right to be so assertive and i'm not sure where it's going to get us 

319.03 323.58 A: well most of the u._n. team this time isn't american it's only a few 

321.97 323.11 B: yes 

323.25 324.22 B: yes 

323.65 335.54 A: and that's become a problem because the americans on the team [mn] are cleared and have access to a whole lot of information the rest of the team doesn't because it's our militaries and they're saying 

335.46 341.23 A: do we how do we tell people we think they should look somewhere without telling them how we know 

341.21 342.53 B: huh 

341.41 348.58 A: you know [laughter] because sometimes our people have access to say satellite photos that the others aren't allowed to see 

345.80 346.86 B: right 

348.97 362.00 A: and you can't you also can't tell them in a way you can't tell them what we know because we don't want anyone to know how much we know because we use the same satellites to track say troop movements and whatever but it's like 

360.28 361.69 B: right 

361.93 371.96 A: [sigh] hey guys why don't we go to this town come on come on tell me you want to [laughter] why ah ah i i hear the food there is great 

364.72 365.80 B: yeah 

367.40 368.51 B: yeah 

371.18 373.45 B: [laughter] right 

372.82 377.32 A: great ah great belly dancers something i don't know let's let's go that way 

375.65 376.68 B: yeah 

377.04 378.36 B: yeah 

377.74 385.31 A: but i think probably a lot of it th- there was some reports that he had sent saddam had sent a lot of this stuff home with people 

385.33 388.18 A: to houses to to palaces 

387.52 388.93 B: i'm sure 

388.58 392.34 A: and you know you feel really sorry for the women and children i 

391.98 393.17 B: yeah 

392.57 398.23 A: mean what happens if little the equivalent of suzie knocks over the wrong bottle 

397.87 400.71 B: right no and they have no choice 

400.10 402.12 A: right absolutely no choice 

401.55 405.66 B: i mean their culture is just we can't even imagine how they live 

404.41 409.54 A: well not even the men have a choice so you know let alone the women and children 

406.33 407.19 B: (( yeah )) 

408.32 409.97 B: right right 

410.11 416.68 A: and i assume if you if something happens he'll send a payment to the family but what use is that really 

410.17 411.03 B: and [noise] 

416.20 417.23 B: right 

417.14 418.63 A: you know it 

418.04 429.52 B: no it's totally unfair i i think that it's good that the inspections are going on i feel like there's a presence there and they know they're being watched and i [mn] but i don't think 

428.97 431.92 A: makes it harder it doesn't make it impossible 

430.23 431.11 B: [noise] 

432.03 433.07 B: yeah 

432.47 433.44 A: (( you know )) 

433.49 436.60 A: now did you hear his apology to kuwait this week 

436.62 437.62 B: no 

437.24 451.87 A: i ah he apolo- saddam apologized to kuwait for invading finally [sigh] and his apology basically in so many words said i'm sorry i did it i'm sorry if it caused you any problems but the u._n. and the united states made me do it 

451.67 453.02 B: (( what oh )) 

451.75 458.13 A: their unfair tactics and policies and their draconian attitude made me invade you so blame them 

458.08 459.54 B: please [mn] 

458.56 469.75 A: and i forget what his position is in the government but the kuwaiti it's like the equivalent of say prime minister his basic response was he wasn't even going to dignify it with a response [laughter] 

469.26 470.45 B: right 

469.89 473.14 A: it wasn't even worth replying to 

472.61 473.76 B: right 

473.79 475.94 A: but ah i mean [mn] 

475.45 485.17 B: it's just i don't know i mean i think he's he's a horrible person i think he has like [mn] absence of soul you know i 

485.01 488.25 A: pretty close to it if not entirely 

486.25 487.39 B: yeah 

487.76 493.08 B: yeah i was listening to somebody who interviewed him in the seventies [noise] and um 

493.19 495.00 B: [lipsmack] and she said that his 

495.01 503.34 B: he was very polite civil and she talked to him for like four hours then she said she never saw [noise] him display an emotion 

503.66 506.98 A: no of course not he's he's probably a sociopath 

504.58 505.21 B: (( no )) 

506.39 511.48 B: yeah yeah which is crazy that this person has the power 

509.33 512.12 A: and his they say his son is worse 

512.09 513.09 B: yeah 

512.22 515.38 A: they say his son is like ten times more evil 

514.30 516.18 B: i know i heard that too 

516.36 518.90 A: which is just kind of scary 

518.30 519.60 B: yeah 

519.01 519.73 A: (( i mean )) 

519.78 528.05 A: he's bad but he's he's sort of like a sane evil and his son they say is just ten times more evil and completely [mn] loony tunes 

527.81 528.87 B: yeah 

528.85 533.25 A: so i saddam at least understands if i do this they'll bomb me 

533.21 534.31 B: right 

533.77 540.00 A: you know and and sometimes it's worth it [mn] but sometimes it's not i mean he understands a little bit of the game 

539.84 540.73 B: yeah 

540.13 542.45 A: but his kid doesn't care 

542.37 548.87 B: i i don't i mean i don't really understand where their technology is at i mean this 

548.39 550.92 A: less than ours no doubt [laughter] 

549.89 560.04 B: yeah much much less but um but they do i i i mean they're developing things they have scientists working on things and ah i mean 

557.49 558.13 A: (( mm )) 

559.21 565.68 A: they they do have some good scientists some that even went to say um american and english universities 

565.03 565.96 B: uh-huh 

565.56 579.19 A: [mn] you know back in the old days before saddam came up and he was the enemy and they were allowed to come here and we taught them everything and sent them back home again so they could build a strong country that would be pro-united states whoops 

573.08 574.10 B: right 

578.79 587.03 B: right well i don't know what we thought we were doing giving anybody weapons though why is that going to make them into a stronger [laughter] country 

586.69 591.98 A: i don't know i think we always hope these countries will fight it out amongst themselves and leave us out of it 

591.28 596.79 B: yeah it's like we're so involved at every aspect it's like we [noise] don't even 

596.75 600.19 A: although afghanistan they did a lot of their own fighting 

600.19 601.46 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

600.25 607.36 A: you know during this last little war we spent a lot of time in in in planes going now move right two paces 

606.71 607.63 B: uh-huh 

607.39 612.27 A: which was good i mean there were much less casualties than you might have expected but 

611.88 612.94 B: (( [noise] right )) 

612.76 616.61 A: who knows what they'll be doing in in twenty years 

615.54 620.64 B: yeah it's all really whether we have an interest or not an epi- an economic interest 

620.42 623.48 A: i don't even think we need their oil actually 

622.80 628.26 B: you know [noise] i wish that we would just [mn] step away and be self sufficient 

627.71 638.08 A: we don't really need theirs i mean we we well we have i mean we've been trading some of the oil for food with saddam but we don't i don't think we need as much of the middle eastern oil as we think we do 

629.40 630.29 B: no 

637.70 646.25 B: and that would be our greatest power if we cut them off if we said you know we're not interested we're not going to trade with you 

641.96 642.87 A: yeah 

645.36 651.24 A: no every time they get new regulations for the cars with the ah the gas mileage and ah 

650.66 651.56 B: (( yup )) 

651.39 662.53 A: there's the electricity it just kind of goes by the way side no- now i own a twenty year old car with crappy gas mileage but you know as soon as they they price me one in a range i can afford i'd be happy to switch 

658.00 658.91 B: yeah 

662.36 663.95 B: right right 

662.92 667.23 A: actually you know what the government ought to do is give tax breaks for switching 

667.45 671.89 A: here's an electric car and your taxes are cut in half for five years 

671.25 674.66 B: you know there was something going on about that 

672.99 684.12 A: there were there were little ones but i mean when you're talking about being lower middle class in terms of income especially in this economy and you're talking about a fifteen thousand dollar car 

680.62 681.63 B: oh yeah 

683.51 684.74 B: yeah forget it 

684.36 688.61 A: for someone who's never bought a new car and probably never will you go 

687.49 689.89 B: yeah [laughter] yup 

689.18 693.50 A: ah sorry guys you're going to have to subsidize me a little more 

693.16 694.13 B: yeah 

693.53 695.01 A: (( than than that )) 

694.31 700.64 B: th- [mn] they don't want us in the electric cars though i mean they want us dependent on ah on on the gas 

700.04 702.24 A: well the gas companies do for sure 

701.73 714.32 B: i mean you look look at just our heating how we heat our homes i mean [noise] thirty years ago a lot of people heated with wood and now we're all we're switched over [noise] to fuel 

710.89 711.70 A: (( yes )) 

713.85 718.65 A: wood's renewable but it does have some ah it does have some environmental issues 

717.93 719.89 B: oh definitely it's it's polluting [noise] bu
