7.08 8.65 B: do you have a favorite holiday 

8.29 9.23 A: um 

9.43 13.33 A: i think it'd probably be a toss up between halloween and christmas 

14.12 16.30 B: oh yeah me too i like halloween 

16.43 19.78 A: i like halloween 'cause it's a a very celtic holiday 

19.89 25.24 A: and i like christmas 'cause of all the giving gifts routine not so much the getting but i like the giving 

25.58 27.35 B: [noise] yeah i do too 

27.74 31.49 B: although i was thinking when when the the phone call first came 

31.61 35.40 B: when i was younger i thought christmas was so commercial that 

35.65 39.85 B: i i rallied against it but now that i'm older i don't seem to mind 

39.99 44.13 A: i don't know i think there's a little nostalgia in with the commercialism you know 

44.69 51.36 A: you you yeah the there's a lot of um selling you things but at the same time you sort of 

51.56 54.55 A: (( i don't know it doesn't look so bad [laughter] as you get older [laughter] )) 

53.94 54.99 B: i know 

54.98 62.53 A: like the garish light displays start to soften a little i i'm seeing them the same way i did when i was five they're just neat 

55.20 56.42 B: (( i i like uh )) 

62.28 63.24 B: right 

62.64 67.41 A: i'm running the electricity tally in the back of my mind but i'm telling it to shut up you know 

66.86 68.42 B: [laughter] 

68.48 75.43 B: right i enjoy how things look i like things that are pretty and colorful and you know it's the only time of year that 

75.67 79.93 B: [mn] sort of there's across the board attempt to make things look nice 

79.79 80.88 A: yeah 

80.28 86.87 B: like offices and stores and people try to be cheerful and people try to be friendly 

86.80 90.81 A: sort of like there's two holidays in a way i mean you have sort of this 

91.60 103.11 A: holiday of generosity and and good feeling and and the religious overtones and then there's sort of the commercial holiday and i just kinda tell myself there's two holidays on the same day 

103.44 107.03 A: you know and and i like the one and and the other one is 

107.31 113.42 A: yeah i could do without some of the you know gee it's it's october first time for christmas 

113.19 114.88 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] right )) 

114.13 117.70 A: my my husband pitches a fit when that happens 

117.07 118.28 B: mine too 

117.92 120.05 A: [laughter] he can't stand it 

118.95 125.47 B: i spotted some uh christmas decorations in a store in july and i had to rush home to tell him that 

124.93 126.82 A: [laughter] 

125.74 127.67 B: it's already started 

128.07 132.79 A: he's pretty sure that the by by the time he's in his like seventies it'll be like 

132.85 137.44 A: december twenty seventh when they put them out for next year you know 

136.87 137.99 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

137.58 140.70 A: like three hundred and sixty three more shopping days 

140.79 152.64 B: right i think that's why i like halloween it's because they don't there's no sort of other thing going on it's just really a good reason to have fun and people dress up and that's fun and 

153.15 158.09 B: i don't know i think that uh it's all so colorful like the orange and black 

158.07 160.45 A: lots of candy can't be beat either 

160.61 167.22 B: yeah although i mean that's a tough one to like have to eat you know like the candy's here so you end up eating 

160.70 161.71 A: any ex- 

167.03 170.22 A: see i just buy candy i don't like for the kids 

169.76 171.86 B: that's what i did this year [laughter] 

171.27 179.66 A: i either buy stuff i can't hate or stuff like twizzlers individually wrapped twizlers how much trouble can you get in [laughter] 

176.19 177.57 B: right i bought 

178.83 181.75 B: oh yeah and uh i think they liked it better 

181.66 185.12 A: yeah they they seem to and 

183.47 195.97 B: the variety like i bought a big bag of all these assorted sweet things like sour balls and gum and sweet tarts and i don't like those things but they they seem to be pretty happy 

195.11 204.04 A: this year i didn't get any trick or treaters but i give all the candy to my mom to take to her sunday school class the next week and they all were quite thrilled so 

204.04 208.38 B: i didn't get any trick or treaters either like five groups and i was really disappointed 

208.45 209.55 B: where do you live 

209.17 217.16 A: uh i live in a little community in delaware and and usually we get a few but this year we had that whole sniper thing 

216.83 218.55 B: (( right [cough] wow )) 

217.60 220.82 A: and um actually the the guy who 

220.88 227.46 A: who like gave the tip to catch the sniper was like from the area so everybody was sort of in a tizzy 

227.74 229.17 B: that was frightening 

228.85 240.26 A: and they had um uh we had like a couple of community parties and i think most of the kids went to the community parties instead although we normally get a handful or two um being a small 

236.07 236.89 B: (( right right )) 

240.23 251.02 A: small town with or village with walkways and parkways and i mean you can pretty much get to almost all the village with only crossing a uh like a road road once or twice 

251.17 252.88 A: you know but 

251.99 253.68 B: do you have children yourself 

253.42 256.03 A: no no just the cats but 

255.75 261.57 B: mm yeah i know if i'd had children and lived out there i'd have probably been so freaked out 

262.06 268.50 A: well i figured the chances that they were gonna be up in our little tiny little hamlet were pretty slim but 

267.09 269.35 B: (( pretty slim [cough] yeah )) 

268.88 276.08 A: you know people will i i didn't see as many people with their lights on either this year it just seemed a a little subdued 

276.79 282.03 A: but hopefully people will be a little more christmasy now that things have calmed down just a little 

282.37 283.59 B: right 

283.03 285.82 A: although there's that whole war thing but you know 

285.93 287.44 B: (( you have to ignore it )) 

286.04 288.82 A: people tend to ignore that at christmas [laughter] 

289.52 292.23 B: and so many people have been shipped out 

291.80 292.67 A: yeah 

292.36 297.40 B: i hear there's a lot of military people and and a lot of my students actually 

297.77 302.33 B: are in the national guard and and since the whole nine eleven 

302.51 308.59 B: thing that [cough] many people have gotten called up and it was it's very stressful for people 

310.65 321.50 A: yeah we've uh around here there's a lot of drives to send stuff over to the troops cards uh coupons for the wives candy bars for the single soldiers that kind of stuff 

320.97 321.90 B: right 

321.56 330.45 A: but then again being being in delaware we're not too far from do- dover air force base and you know you have a pretty good uh troop 

327.21 328.02 B: right 

330.77 332.78 A: contingency in the area 

333.95 337.03 A: so what type of holiday would you like to create 

336.64 343.06 B: well that's a good one i when when the question was asked i thought well none because we have too many already 

343.34 345.86 B: [laughter] that's my feeling what's your feeling 

346.13 348.01 A: i i wish we could [sigh] 

348.02 352.88 A: i'd like to create a holiday that they couldn't commercialize if they tried 

352.97 355.43 A: but i'm not sure how you'd pull it off 

355.44 361.04 A: national stay home and bake cookies day and they'd figure out a way to sell you cookie mixes 

355.52 356.10 B: (( [cough] )) 

360.77 361.79 B: right 

361.59 363.47 A: uh ah that 

362.41 373.11 B: i heard about a a a i guess um a plan or it was a bumper sticker or something about a a day where you don't consume or you don't buy anything or you don't consume anything 

369.15 370.56 A: (( would )) 

373.46 377.00 B: you know sort of a non commercial day just don't buy anything 

377.25 381.70 A: actually be a kind of a nice holiday a whole a whole day with your family and nobody goes shopping 

381.62 382.88 B: right right and 

382.23 384.57 A: and you can't give anything for it either 

384.22 385.18 B: right 

385.09 391.47 A: you just sort of make do with things around the house it'd be kind of nice but i don't think you'd get too many people to celebrate it [laughter] 

391.10 393.79 B: no i don't think so [laughter] 

393.99 394.76 A: but 

394.16 396.00 B: no i don't think so 

395.34 401.70 A: people are all into the the commercial side of christmas like last year we decided to go to uh bethlehem p. a. for christmas 

401.76 402.52 B: (( oh wow wow )) 

401.86 412.00 A: and the uh christmas market was fabulous and all the lights and all that and they were all j- you know just like you expect you know the tour groups all go up there 

412.15 416.01 A: but it was a big massive thing but 

415.96 420.56 A: in the end we found this little tiny they have a custom of these little creches they do there like the 

420.36 431.88 A: churches decorate them the moravian churches and they tell the story of christmas in these little tiny creches and we found one we found out about one that was going to be in the back part of town and we went 

432.09 438.27 A: and they were showing it for like three nights every weekend for the whole month they show it off to groups 

438.25 447.92 A: and there were only four people in our group and yet you know like five or six people all these kids and stuff did the whole presentation just for us for free 

447.67 448.67 B: wow 

448.43 461.92 A: and you're sitting there in these little folding chairs in this little tiny basement and looking at this panorama that was easily i'd say twenty feet long by fifteen feet tall they had decorated the whole end of one room 

462.06 475.14 A: and they had running water and little animals and lights and music and they would come out and recite things and then the lights would flash on like this one little tiny diorama scene and they'd read something and then they'd go to the next bit 

475.09 480.04 A: and there's just my mother my husband myself and like maybe one or two other people 

480.21 484.64 A: and they're doing it all with the same passion that they'd do it for a hundred 

480.25 480.91 B: mm 

484.56 485.95 B: (( yeah that's nice )) 

484.81 499.28 A: and when you're done you can leave a donation if you want and they have a little tiny room where they laid you they had baked cookies and you could buy a couple of cookies on your way out or a handmade candle and it was just sort of it was like the anti christmas 

499.40 513.95 A: and it was nice it was my favorite part of the whole trip even after doing the huge craft bazaar and the tour of the town with the costumed guide and the everything you know you're supposed to do it was like yes there you go 

514.56 521.77 A: you know they they the you bought something but you bought something that you know i baked these cookies yesterday we hope you like them 

521.39 522.70 B: (( [laughter] [cough] [laughter] [cough] mhm right )) 

522.41 528.53 A: and it was it was it was kind of nice to see the holiday being celebrated on this small scale 

528.78 529.61 B: yeah 

528.94 532.04 A: i mean it was a big diorama but it was very personal 

532.11 537.71 A: and i don't know most of the holidays like valentine's isn't even personal any more 

537.56 538.51 B: right 

537.96 540.42 A: i don't know how they've managed to pull that off 

540.14 541.87 B: [laughter] 

540.92 541.72 A: [laughter] 

541.92 546.60 A: you'd think uh they could keep valentine's day personal but even it's turned into this 

547.23 550.96 A: i don't know my h- my husband thinks hallmark cards is behind all of them 

551.10 554.64 B: yes [cough] they're very [laughter] very huge industry 

555.02 557.95 B: and i think uh you know there's a certain amount of uh 

559.06 560.94 B: i don't know trying to 

561.06 570.09 B: do the right thing you know feel like well i've gotta do something for valentine's day and then what is it gonna be and does it measure up and is it the kind of thing that you know you see on t._v. 

570.25 577.87 B: and you know it it's a lot of pressure [laughter] for people you there's no there's a sense you can't really be authentic and do your own thing 

578.26 592.02 A: nah i think i liked valentine's day better when i was i don't know five through about ten i had a we had family friends that had a son about the same age as i and every year we'd send each other one of those big russell stover hearts 

591.73 592.96 B: yeah 

592.11 605.24 A: i mean we started out with the small ones but by the h- time we hit ten we were doing like the two pounders with the five pounds of lace on it and you know and i still have them i still have the empty boxes because 

600.56 602.06 B: [laughter] those are pretty 

605.30 607.01 A: the candy stunk 

607.07 608.08 B: [laughter] 

607.51 611.92 A: and and and we weren't in love but the sentiment was pure 

612.07 613.01 B: yeah 

612.39 620.73 A: you know happy valentine's day in shaky hand lettering and and a and the drug store candy it it wasn't 

620.79 625.56 A: and it wasn't a diamond and it was quite a bit nicer than both 

625.64 626.54 A: (( you know )) 

625.64 630.88 B: yeah i remember being very little and you know filling out the little tiny valentines to all your classmates 

630.94 639.23 B: and then on valentine's day everybody would you know come home with as many as you made from all your classmates that was nice that 

638.32 641.46 A: and the decorating the valentine's day box usually 

641.03 642.43 B: yeah 

641.91 655.30 A: i liked that that was that was fun nowadays i don't know a lot of the schools around here they don't do like a class valentine day swap you're l- 'cause i don't know people were getting excluded or they were afraid they'd be excluded or 

652.94 654.01 B: right 

655.06 656.69 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

656.23 660.88 A: you know i know i never quite received as many valentines as i gave but that's life 

660.68 662.23 B: right [laughter] 

661.60 663.80 A: might as well learn that when you're seven 

663.89 664.98 A: [laughter] 

664.71 665.86 B: yeah 

665.36 671.20 A: i mean it's it's tough when you figure that out when you're like in your twenties it's a little more traumatic i think 

670.76 672.25 B: it's very traumatic when 

672.72 674.57 B: not everybody's nice 

675.17 676.80 B: not everybody's 

677.70 679.33 B: on the same page 

679.19 685.50 A: [laughter] that's one nice thing about the christmas though is people do try to even if only for appearance's sake be nice for 

685.78 686.84 B: right i 

686.14 687.21 A: a little 

687.27 693.17 B: noticed that in the store the other day that the sales people were just making an effort to be 

693.26 694.57 B: very friendly 

695.22 699.39 B: and it was a stark contrast because [laughter] basically they're kinda not 

699.52 700.38 B: but 

700.49 706.01 B: i liked it i thought i like it even though it's fake and it's contrived it's i like it 

705.72 712.77 A: well the there there there's a charm they have in in uh or i've heard it when i went to iowa and it's called the sincere con 

712.63 713.87 B: [laughter] 

713.13 717.99 A: it's it's when somebody's conning you but they're doing it with sincerity and you can appreciate it 

717.80 719.90 B: that's a good expression i'll remember that
