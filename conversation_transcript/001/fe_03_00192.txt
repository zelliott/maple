30.07 32.97 A: so we're supposed to talk about holidays huh 

32.05 38.54 B: yes we are supposed to talk about holidays according to the instructions and creating a holiday which i haven't thought about at all 

38.19 39.61 A: (( okay [mn] )) 

38.98 40.59 B: do you have a favorite holiday 

40.26 41.17 A: (( i )) 

41.52 45.21 A: think that my favorite holiday is thanksgiving 

44.70 45.82 B: mine too 

45.88 49.87 A: (( and why [laughter] )) 

48.05 58.92 B: well because it's not a religious holiday primarily and i think it's a great holiday 'cause it lets everybody participate i like that part of it a lot 

51.09 52.62 A: uh-huh uh-huh hm 

58.51 59.69 A: mhm 

59.05 60.22 B: um 

60.81 63.97 B: and it just doesn't seem to have quite the emotional 

64.46 67.78 B: baggage that some other holidays have like christmas 

67.31 69.24 A: mhm mhm 

68.55 74.76 B: but then i guess thanksgiving and christmas are about the only two i celebrate so it's [laughter] it's hard to say 

72.40 73.33 A: mhm 

74.42 75.83 A: yeah 

75.21 77.20 B: (( uh yeah )) 

76.05 82.36 A: yeah i think for me it would be thanksgiving um i'm jewish so i don't have the christmas thing to compare with 

81.87 84.23 B: yeah [laughter] yeah 

82.67 84.43 A: and um 

85.48 91.42 A: [mn] so it's really i i do that and i do um passover with my family but that is more 

91.92 93.05 A: (( uh )) 

93.25 98.64 A: can get boring sometimes [laughter] and thank- i just really like to uh 

94.45 96.21 B: (( well )) 

98.95 101.63 A: [mn] get together with my family so i like that 

101.92 110.64 B: i lived in japan for six years and i um [lipsmack] learned about celebrating new years which i had never celebrated before 

110.23 113.87 A: in jap- a japanese new year is it the same new years as ours or 

111.59 112.52 B: uh-huh 

113.43 117.44 B: well no well it's the same date it's the same calendar date 

117.02 119.31 A: yeah so so what do they do in japan 

118.85 122.14 B: well they take off the first four days of the year for one thing 

122.32 128.06 B: and it's a time at the end of the year for deep house cleaning and 

127.75 129.15 A: for what what cleaning 

128.73 131.06 B: deep house cleaning 

130.77 131.75 A: okay 

131.36 141.85 B: and a lot of uh food preparation because you don't really do anything except eat and drink and talk to people for the first four days it's a very very 

141.19 141.99 A: (( oh )) 

142.15 144.36 B: very relaxing holiday 

143.26 146.72 A: eat and drink [laughter] for four days 

145.00 145.70 B: (( [laughter] )) 

146.10 151.32 B: yeah i mean it's not constant eating and drinking it's just that the food's all prepared 

150.89 154.29 A: and the families all stay together i mean they all get together 

152.76 156.99 B: and they do no they visit other people and visit other families 

155.56 156.29 A: (( oh )) 

156.87 159.04 A: i have never heard of that 

158.40 159.80 B: yeah it's great 

159.98 160.80 A: huh 

160.37 164.17 B: it's a very wonderful way to spend a four day period 

161.71 162.37 A: (( un- )) 

163.39 165.44 A: unlike our wonderful new years here 

165.58 171.06 B: well yeah it's very different because it's it's kinda more 

166.17 167.92 A: [laughter] 

173.46 180.60 B: i don't know i don't wanna say spiritual but it it has it's a bit more serious as a holiday you know people really do think about it 

178.14 179.18 A: (( oh so new )) 

180.02 183.64 A: yeah and here new years i mean it's certainly not a family thing or anything that 

182.44 185.01 B: no not definitely not a family thing 

184.98 186.57 A: (( yeah )) 

185.70 189.23 B: except maybe watching the rose parade or something 

188.94 190.02 A: right 

190.24 195.58 A: so this other question about what what was it what holiday would you 

195.44 196.77 B: create [sigh] 

196.14 198.18 A: oh my goodness gracious 

199.12 203.88 A: i always think of solstice things i mean for me it's like things that are sort of honoring the 

199.43 200.01 B: (( [cough] )) 

204.47 209.63 A: i don't know about honoring the seasons but something kinda connected with nature 

209.00 209.83 B: uh-huh 

210.24 210.95 A: (( um )) 

210.27 216.16 B: yeah that seems like a reasonable kind of holidays we have some that are um 

216.96 219.59 B: connected with nature but very indirectly 

219.76 221.02 B: i suppose 

221.06 229.34 B: but um what time of year do you like uh if i had a holiday i'd certainly like to have an earlier autumn holiday 

228.89 231.92 A: autumn i love autumn is my favorite 

231.35 235.07 B: i wouldn't mind having a an indian summer holiday 

234.92 242.40 A: [laughter] i wouldn't mind having a thank god it's not hot any more and thank god i feel invigorated [laughter] but just i don't know 

237.54 239.17 B: yeah that's a good one 

240.39 242.22 B: yeah that's right 

242.82 246.25 B: yeah well something naturish and something 

246.45 249.44 B: in the right time of year i think that would be nice 

249.18 252.80 A: and it would have to involve people that i was close to 

252.65 254.50 B: mhm 

253.06 263.60 A: either family or maybe friends because there are all you have all these holidays that sort of you're supposed to be with your family but there's nothing that's really about being with friends 

260.40 261.80 B: mhm 

262.94 264.08 B: that's true 

264.10 269.86 B: so we could have it a a friendly autumn solstice midsummer i mean uh whatever 

264.12 265.61 A: so that might be cool 

269.58 270.99 A: with with with 

271.28 272.11 A: you know 

272.31 275.65 A: i don't know harvesting vegetables or something or 

275.73 276.37 B: (( with )) 

276.42 281.97 B: kind of a thanksgiving idea but i like the friends part yeah i like the friends part 

278.94 285.84 A: but with friends with friends yeah 'cause the family stuff gets so loaded for so many people it's such an intense heavy holiday 

285.46 286.81 B: yeah that's true 

286.43 287.27 A: so 

286.98 288.66 B: that's really true 

288.68 290.72 B: i wouldn't mind having a 

291.21 292.36 B: um 

292.82 293.54 B: hm 

293.73 298.77 B: maybe a mental health holiday an official mental health holiday 

295.45 297.62 A: (( a mental [laughter] and what would and what would that be )) 

297.96 300.46 A: [laughter] tell me about that [laughter] 

298.97 304.04 B: [laughter] [laughter] well you know it could just be sort of a personal holiday 

304.05 307.69 B: but a- an official one everyone could just stay home 

307.33 310.39 A: m- a mental health the mental health holiday 

309.67 318.99 B: yeah you w- you didn't have to do anything you don't have to cook a dinner you don't have to buy a present you don't have to be with anybody you can just you know 

319.44 320.45 B: check out 

320.19 325.54 A: that's a that's a inter- i work for my work i work with um i work with psychiatric patients so 

324.85 326.37 B: (( oh you do wow )) 

325.78 333.62 A: (( so now you're giving me an idea [laughter] of asking people if you could have a mental health holiday what would it look like [laughter] )) 

327.19 329.68 B: [laughter] 

332.97 336.14 B: i think a mental health holiday would be just dandy 

334.94 337.37 A: what would that what would that mean 

337.27 341.31 B: yeah well it wouldn't mean work is that's what it wouldn't mean [laughter] 

340.54 342.53 A: (( [laughter] right right )) 

341.82 345.21 B: i wouldn't mind what b- what are you associated with the hospital 

345.21 348.11 A: i i work i work in in a hospital 

347.51 348.38 B: mhm 

348.20 350.50 A: yeah yeah north of boston 

348.69 349.84 B: yeah 

350.09 351.57 B: oh north boston 

351.29 352.20 A: yeah 

351.59 355.12 B: yeah i spent a couple of summers working at harvard teaching at harvard 

355.08 356.47 A: what did you teach 

356.31 358.38 B: english as a second language 

358.04 359.38 A: oh wow 

358.96 364.45 B: so i mean i think having a a holiday where everybody sat at the 

364.80 372.46 B: you know at a table outside and drink coffee and read the newspaper and just didn't have to do anything 

372.51 373.42 B: much 

372.55 373.36 A: (( mhm )) 

374.14 377.49 B: that would be pretty cool i wouldn't mind that at all 

377.09 380.18 A: [laughter] the l- 

379.60 387.54 B: but um i don't know i like a nature holiday 'spose we should have a i don't want any winter holidays 

387.62 394.30 A: no winter holiday although there should be i i absolutely hate winter i am having such a hard time with this and so if there was something 

393.89 396.20 B: maybe that's when we need the mental health 

395.58 398.12 A: well or something and something that has 

398.27 401.81 A: fires and candles and [sigh] 

402.51 409.22 A: oh i don't know anything to it's such a hard time of year so anything to to reinvigorate me 

409.45 410.10 B: (( mm )) 

409.53 412.63 A: or or make me enjoy the winter 

412.95 416.15 B: [mn] that's pretty hard to do i'd say 

413.82 418.41 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

417.24 421.54 B: i wouldn't mind um let's see yeah fires 

421.86 424.00 A: (( i don't know [laughter] a- a- and as long as i didn't have to go )) 

424.08 428.79 A: that it wasn't hard to to get to whatever it was that i didn't have to schlep around to 

428.20 429.11 B: yeah 

429.08 433.31 A: but but that would be good 'cause there's nothing really there's nothing 

433.83 439.17 B: i suppose the question would be do we need do we need any more holidays 

433.84 435.83 A: there's no cool holi- 

439.18 440.98 A: do we need any more holidays 

440.53 441.94 B: yeah 

441.10 443.20 A: i think we need meaningful holidays 

443.09 443.78 B: (( mm )) 

443.42 445.87 A: i mean i think a lot of the holidays we have aren't 

445.90 449.63 A: you know they're days off but they don't really mean anything to most people 

449.81 451.31 B: (( yeah )) 

449.89 451.90 A: i think i mean at least to me 

451.39 457.09 B: i've thought about that too because really we don't celebrate labor day 

457.24 462.04 B: i mean i suppose about ninety nine percent of the people don't celebrate labor day 

457.63 459.04 A: no no 

462.44 463.47 B: or 

463.55 465.41 A: or veterans day or 

463.57 468.40 B: i suppose more people probably celebrate veterans day and memorial day 

468.48 469.56 A: yeah i 

470.53 473.82 A: [mn] i you know i think 

475.29 480.20 A: the only ones that i think i ever do are probably like the thanksgiving 

481.73 484.29 A: and the other ones are just like days off from work 

484.30 486.02 B: yeah 

484.88 490.22 A: i mean and that's awful to me yeah some of the jewish holidays are but not many of them either so 

486.58 488.45 B: yeah 

489.99 491.82 B: yeah i think that's right 

492.30 494.49 B: i would like to have a 

495.83 496.63 B: hm 

496.82 498.49 A: hm [laughter] 

499.11 508.41 B: maybe i just wanna retire [laughter] [laughter] oh yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't mind just retiring maybe that's nice 

501.12 505.20 A: (( yeah you sound like you're kinda tired [laughter] like you need )) 

506.88 509.16 A: (( to relax [laughter] )) 

508.81 511.22 B: ah that would be good 

510.10 512.32 A: that's dangerous for me to even say 

511.80 513.17 B: yeah well 

513.20 515.15 B: especially um [cough] 

515.89 516.79 B: (( yeah )) 

517.57 522.67 B: i was gonna say especially with your work we don't want people like you to retire 

522.12 524.13 A: [laughter] 

523.58 530.11 B: we need people [laughter] really you need the work i don't need the work [laughter] there's nothing life or death about my work 

529.48 532.20 A: do you work do you teach the english as the second language [mn] 

531.40 533.95 B: (( mhm uh y- yeah i'm i have a )) 

534.31 535.17 B: (( a )) 

535.91 539.33 B: position at penn in the english language programs 

539.35 543.70 B: which is uh just for international students who wanna study english 

542.81 546.22 A: oh that sounds won- that's something i would love to do so much 

545.76 547.19 B: yeah it's nice 

546.66 549.07 A: i've thought about going back to school for it but uh 

548.71 550.18 B: that's very nice 

549.26 551.65 A: kinda late now but uh 

550.66 554.63 B: well and and you wouldn't make any money compared with what you do so 

552.64 557.64 A: that's what that's the other thing is like yeah to go back to school and then not have a good income but uh 

557.74 558.72 B: right 

558.89 562.64 B: yeah we definitely have to have a holiday where you don't have to give presents 

562.62 568.11 A: uh-huh no presents n- no no no presents no pressure 

563.30 566.64 B: i think i think presents are kind of loaded too 

567.80 569.73 B: no presents no pressure 

569.93 574.19 A: other people but just very s- only friends but very simple 

570.80 572.32 B: only friends 

574.50 576.43 B: (( although a lot of people have )) 

576.74 580.73 B: friends in their family i mean you know they really like their families 

578.79 579.54 A: (( uh-huh )) 

580.12 583.30 A: yeah right and that that's fine if it works but uh 

582.34 585.32 B: but for most people it's kind of 

585.66 586.71 B: difficult 

586.69 588.27 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

588.16 589.70 B: so friends are good 

589.81 593.59 B: of course that would really be troublesome for people who didn't have any friends wouldn't it 

594.06 596.44 A: yeah [laughter] well yeah i mean 

596.47 597.81 A: definitely 

597.18 597.93 B: (( hm mm )) 

598.43 600.21 A: but um 

600.27 602.17 A: it could be an optional 

602.97 606.40 A: an optional holiday i don't know yeah i mean 

603.02 603.86 B: yeah 

605.53 609.23 B: wouldn't it be nice to have a really meaningful national holiday 

609.61 610.77 A: (( mhm mm )) 

609.68 617.17 B: i i would like that we had in philadelphia a i don't remember if it was one day or more than one day a volunteer 

617.68 625.49 B: day when there was quite a lot of national attention on i don't know if it was phila- philadelphia only or se- several places 

625.60 627.78 B: but it was really kind of 

628.45 629.60 B: very 

629.90 631.30 B: inspiring 

630.94 633.75 A: was that uh before or after september eleventh 

633.31 636.57 B: oh much before some years before 

634.32 638.07 A: yeah that's great that's that's a good idea 

637.70 640.00 B: yeah i like the idea of having 

639.70 642.54 A: a holiday of like giving or something i mean that's that's 

641.23 642.70 B: yeah a whole 

642.71 648.02 B: national day of volunteering and we just stop every business 

648.11 652.06 B: we turn off the clocks and we go outside and do something nice 

652.30 656.91 A: that's that's good sort of a humanitarian 

657.82 659.96 A: give back to the world 

659.62 660.61 B: (( mhm )) 

660.23 662.15 A: holiday or something like that 

661.59 666.57 B: yeah a day of giving back although that's getting a little cliched 

666.35 667.74 A: right right but you have 

666.81 669.34 B: and a lot of people volunteer all the time 

669.39 677.65 B: but it would be nice to do the whole country doing it all on one day how much could you get done if every single person 

672.46 674.94 A: okay i like i like that idea 

677.70 680.61 B: didn't work and went out and did something good 

680.61 681.32 A: (( yeah )) 

681.39 686.11 A: that's that's that's a good idea you you should you should work on that one [laughter] 

684.86 686.92 B: [noise] [laughter] yeah 

686.25 690.00 A: (( you're in a university setting [laughter] you can kind of [laughter] i like that )) 

688.63 691.72 B: [noise] yeah i'm i'm h- [noise] 

691.12 692.62 A: that that's good 

692.06 697.19 B: hearing my telephone [noise] j- just one second i don't have any idea 

697.34 698.36 B: (( whoops )) 

698.87 704.35 B: oh yeah okay i don't have to worry about it i just wanted to see who it was 

704.34 709.54 A: i i i told my children there's no way they can interrupt me during this conversation [laughter] 

708.89 711.60 B: i forgot how long this conversation is 

710.63 712.50 A: supposed to be ten minutes 

711.90 719.43 B: ten minutes i don't i i think it m- must be coming to an end then then pretty soon have you done this one before 

718.65 719.89 A: i didn't i
