0.47 1.70 B: hello 

1.07 2.26 A: hi 

2.10 4.34 B: [lipsmack] my name is kristen asplen 

3.94 5.36 A: hi i'm tina koller 

5.31 6.86 B: [lipsmack] um 

7.00 16.65 B: i haven't this is my first call on this system [laughter] [laughter] um [lipsmack] i am a professor and i am 

10.07 11.17 A: mine too 

17.04 18.49 A: where are you a professor 

18.52 20.60 B: uh pittsburgh at 

19.87 20.67 A: okay 

20.93 22.13 B: (( and )) 

22.60 25.10 B: i'm relatively liberally minded 

24.89 25.74 A: uh-huh 

25.25 26.39 B: so 

26.46 31.03 B: i'm actually kind of pacifistically minded so i i really 

31.72 35.09 B: [mn] don't believe in um [lipsmack] 

35.22 39.96 B: a pre emptive strike i i feel that that's kind of aggression 

39.77 40.92 A: (( mhm )) 

40.85 41.71 B: so 

42.27 52.44 A: do you think that iraq has these weapons of mass destruction that the u._s. claims they don't have and they cla- i'm sorry the u._s. claims they do have and they claim that they don't have 

53.09 54.07 B: um 

54.24 56.22 B: i think it's certainly possible [mn] 

57.08 61.20 A: then what do you think should be done to disarm them 

62.03 69.48 B: i think that the steps that the u._n. are taking are fine i don't know what's going to happen when things come to a head [laughter] 

68.90 72.71 A: you mean like when they find it find some evidence of 

70.82 71.62 B: (( we- )) 

72.06 77.45 B: oh actually probably when iraq says i'm sorry you can't look here and and and 

77.49 87.28 B: 'cause i i don't think they're ever actually going to find anything i think iraq's just gonna say no no that's it i'm sorry like they did last time so [laughter] nah too close sorry 

80.30 81.38 A: (( ah )) 

83.35 85.83 A: [laughter] 

86.67 93.47 A: yeah they seem to be very open right now and very cooperative which is curious 

91.50 92.61 B: (( yeah )) 

92.90 98.13 B: [sigh] yeah a lot of people think they may have ah shipped their stuff somewhere else 

97.61 98.88 A: out of the country 

98.35 100.52 B: yeah so [lipsmack] 

100.37 109.94 A: i wouldn't be against that i i i don't agree with [sigh] going to war without a really good reason and i'm not sure whether this is a good reason right now 

108.74 110.58 B: no me either 

110.40 114.35 A: 'cause th- [sigh] the u._s. claims that they have proof 

114.13 115.23 B: mhm 

115.29 118.20 A: which i'm inclined to believe 

118.23 124.58 A: but i haven't seen the proof so i i wouldn't want to be in a decision making position on this issue right now 

123.16 127.02 B: no and and even so and i understand that 

128.43 139.75 B: [sigh] it's extremely difficult when you're in the position of can you keep someone from dying or not um but personally i don't think that i have the right to 

134.06 135.34 A: yeah 

140.01 145.00 B: kill or attack anyone to keep someone else from maybe who might have been dying 

144.96 145.83 A: (( uh-huh )) 

145.56 147.70 B: to keep them from dying you know what i mean 

147.76 149.73 A: no i'm not sure can you explain that again 

150.54 156.45 B: uh [mn] you know i don't think i can be the one who can make a decision to say okay i'm gonna kill you to keep you from killing other people 

155.92 157.24 A: ah yes 

156.63 160.49 B: [laughter] if you haven't already killed people i can't 

160.32 161.22 A: (( ah )) 

160.84 162.31 B: make that decision 

161.85 168.04 A: right yeah there's the potential like that movie that- that's out with um [lipsmack] 

162.37 163.30 B: so 

168.25 173.07 A: tom cruise they they arrest potential criminals 

171.69 174.11 B: [noise] yeah yeah 

174.04 177.04 A: no- not quite as extreme as the movie is but 

175.95 178.31 B: well of course not yes just bas- 

177.38 183.07 A: but there's there's already evidence that saddam hussein is a pretty nasty guy 

182.59 191.44 B: oh yeah yeah i realize this and i have great conflict over this [laughter] personal conflict but i am [lipsmack] 

187.99 190.00 A: yeah yeah 

192.44 195.81 B: generally a pacifist in nature and and 

194.52 195.51 A: (( mhm )) 

196.14 197.82 B: bush is so [sigh] 

197.94 199.73 B: kind of gun toting 

200.56 203.56 A: yeah maybe that comes from his texas upbringing 

200.76 202.08 B: [sigh] gung ho 

202.93 206.61 B: yes quite possibly that kind of rankles me 

204.18 205.23 A: yeah 

206.23 210.42 A: yeah i don't know i how to classify myself whether i'm 

211.11 214.77 A: passive or aggressive or passive aggressive 

214.19 215.52 B: [laughter] 

214.90 218.76 A: or what i i do believe in um 

219.15 226.49 A: [lipsmack] taking action when necessary but the definition of when necessary is that's the tough part right there 

221.67 222.72 B: mhm 

226.14 228.41 B: right absolutely 

229.02 231.78 B: these are of course very gray areas 

231.53 234.31 A: [lipsmack] yeah they are which is what makes it 

234.18 246.40 A: um an interesting topic i suppose for this to discussion [laughter] [laughter] that's right that's right [lipsmack] it's a tremendous investment to do something like this 

236.26 241.42 B: [laughter] for them to overhear yes [laughter] 

246.26 252.83 A: the last time they went over it it the victory was so absolute and so quick 

252.48 253.70 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

253.60 256.19 A: that you would hope that a similar 

254.88 262.37 B: or there was there was so much help and it was such an impoverished country there was so much help within the country and it was such an impoverished country that 

259.06 260.51 A: mhm 

262.52 265.25 B: and and the leadership was so 

265.39 271.74 B: obnoxiously oppressive that that it was not hard to get world support for it so 

267.14 268.37 A: yes 

271.02 273.03 A: yeah and th- 

273.13 276.92 A: i don't know that the leadership has changed their um tactics any 

276.70 278.32 B: right 

277.14 278.16 A: now 

279.17 281.43 A: and except for the [mn] 

282.80 284.54 A: arabic countries 

285.08 290.28 A: there's not e- even so there's not quite as much support now as there was then 

289.99 291.13 B: right 

290.49 294.42 A: because they didn't invade another country there's there's the threat now 

292.46 295.39 B: right they're not as directly linked 

295.07 296.76 A: yeah that's true 

295.65 297.21 B: well technically [mn] 

297.51 300.19 B: you know that afghanistan wasn't 

300.32 302.03 B: didn't invade us either 

301.52 308.87 A: [lipsmack] oh well it depends on whether you agree that al qaeda came right out of [sigh] afghanistan 

307.43 318.57 B: right right if it was directly kind of a sub part of the government or how close you believe it was to the government or all that kind of stuff [mn] so 

315.50 317.94 A: mhm mhm 

319.40 327.02 A: [lipsmack] i don't have any solutions for disarming iraq other than seeing what happens with these weapons inspections and then deciding 

326.81 337.41 B: right yeah i'm very very glad for a while it didn't sound like they were going to be doing the inspection part [laughter] so i'm i'm much happier right now than i was a month ago but ah i 

330.79 332.49 A: yeah 

334.85 336.00 A: mhm 

336.62 337.68 A: (( mhm )) 

337.99 340.10 B: guess it was getting a little scary there 

339.60 344.87 A: [lipsmack] yeah i was wondering what was going to happen too there was a lot of sword rattling 

342.39 343.31 B: yeah 

344.67 347.41 B: yes yes definitely 

347.49 349.44 B: waving the swords 

348.56 351.55 A: and kicking dirt and [laughter] 

349.85 353.02 B: [laughter] name calling and 

351.84 354.63 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

353.38 357.57 B: other other adult like behavior [laughter] 

355.00 361.92 A: [laughter] yes you- you're really glad that world leaders are [laughter] doing [laughter] 

358.48 362.08 B: (( [laughter] yeah right mhm yeah )) 

362.06 366.91 A: [laughter] but i i don't know what else we can say about this 

363.47 364.52 B: (( [sigh] )) 

366.66 368.72 B: i don't know either so where are you from 

368.59 370.38 A: um i'm in maryland 

369.76 373.61 B: oh maryland my in laws are in maryland at baltimore yes 

372.11 373.22 A: oh yeah 

373.23 376.60 A: oh yeah i don't live to far from baltimore in columbia 

376.44 377.39 B: (( oh yes )) 

378.06 381.14 B: [mn] actually is that right by d._c. 

381.03 386.43 A: ah it's between baltimore and d._c. not quite half way a little closer to baltimore than d._c. 

382.70 383.63 B: okay 

385.96 386.66 B: (( mm )) 

387.44 388.47 B: okay 

387.92 390.36 A: but easy to get to both both cities 

389.77 390.79 B: (( yup )) 

390.98 395.92 B: [mn] my ah in laws have lived in several places but right now they're in 

396.57 404.46 B: ah let me think [laughter] kind of sparks parkville area i don't know if you know the- those are kind of like small communities 

402.23 403.44 A: no 

403.88 405.85 A: is it oh 

404.51 406.38 B: yeah but it's um 

407.31 411.13 B: [lipsmack] south no north east of the city 

410.62 411.55 A: (( oh okay )) 

411.48 412.38 B: so 

412.07 414.97 A: yeah i'm not as familiar with with that area up there 

413.65 415.44 B: yeah yup 

415.17 421.42 A: being living s- south of the city so a- are you an electrical engineering professor at pittsburgh 

417.80 418.62 B: yeah th- 

420.82 423.11 B: no ah psychology 

422.77 429.12 A: oh really so are you already aware of the ears program and that's why you're participating in this 

423.43 424.40 B: yeah 

428.13 433.02 B: i i got the information from um 

433.48 436.48 B: [mn] i haven't done this before it's from ah 

436.53 439.27 B: a linguistics researching 

438.82 440.10 A: oh yeah 

439.48 440.50 B: um 

440.76 441.57 B: ah 

441.78 443.00 B: information 

443.11 447.68 B: newsletter that i get they said that this was available and 

443.99 444.82 A: uh-huh 

447.92 458.03 B: [sigh] i always believe it's good karma to participate in all the research i can so that other people [laughter] participate in mine [laughter] so yes [laughter] 

451.36 452.47 A: yeah 

453.60 464.29 A: [laughter] that's why [laughter] that makes sense so you're probably either st- coming up on exams or in the middle of finals [lipsmack] 

458.59 459.74 B: yes 

463.48 467.00 B: [lipsmack] ah yeah i'm giving my first final tonight 

466.78 467.74 A: ah 

467.24 473.22 B: so in fact i have someone studying in my house just right now [laughter] he's like you know [sigh] 

470.32 472.59 A: [laughter] 

472.78 481.09 A: [laughter] i- i'm an adjunct professor at morgan state university i- i'm giving my final for i'm only teaching one class so that's tomorrow night 

473.53 474.30 B: so 

476.79 477.57 B: ah 

480.66 481.93 B: mhm 

481.33 487.87 A: and this is only the second time i've taught a class it takes a lot to put an a good exam together 

484.23 485.02 B: ah 

487.07 489.60 B: yes yes it does 

488.38 493.42 A: but i'd still rather be putting it together and giving it than taking it 

491.21 502.43 B: [laughter] yeah it's it's amazing you know i- i'll put it together and i'll read it three times and i'll sit down and read it while they're taking it and be like oh my god 

503.31 507.20 A: [laughter] 

503.56 506.09 B: how did i put this question in the test 

507.80 508.74 B: so 

508.15 513.53 A: [laughter] so you- you're questions are probably more discussion oriented 

508.86 509.93 B: yup 

512.99 517.89 B: ah um i wish it could be i have i have very large classes 

515.03 516.74 A: really [mn] 

517.35 520.96 A: oh so then grading something like that would be a nightmare 

518.15 519.19 B: um 

520.33 524.60 B: yeah i do do one essay even though all my classes are sixty 

524.83 526.02 A: wow 

525.16 527.93 B: um forty to sixty but ah 

528.31 531.84 B: but they're very kind of factual essay they're not 

531.22 532.10 A: (( uh-huh )) 

532.27 536.67 B: terribly mentally complicated i do get to next semester do a ah 

537.00 540.39 B: more advanced course that should have about a dozen people or so in so 

539.82 540.80 A: mhm 

540.71 543.77 B: then i'll get to do a little more discussion that'll be nice 

542.05 549.52 A: yeah yeah i've only got five students in my class so that does change your attitude about the exam 

549.26 553.61 B: yes very much so [laughter] the amount of effort yeah 

551.33 552.32 A: (( yeah )) 

552.92 555.69 A: yeah you don't have a grader that can help you out with it 

555.44 559.14 B: [lipsmack] um i don't do that for tests it's an undergraduate so 

558.78 559.69 A: (( oh okay )) 

559.76 560.86 B: it's um 

561.19 563.48 B: i don't do that for tests i do do um 

564.02 567.44 B: [lipsmack] ah multiple choice for most of it so it's 

567.97 574.99 B: um about eighty percent of the test is based on the multiple choice so it doesn't have to kill me [laughter] grading so 

570.85 571.73 A: (( uh-huh )) 

572.92 577.75 A: yeah yeah yeah so my tests are usually mathematical 

577.86 579.60 B: (( um yeah )) 

577.91 589.06 A: so th- if they don't get the answer you have to figure out why they didn't so you can determine how how many points to deduct if they accidentally said three times two is five 

581.92 583.32 B: right yeah 

588.55 589.77 B: right 

589.16 590.09 A: then 

590.19 598.21 A: that's only a point or so but then you have to work your way through and make sure that they didn't make any other errors in there so that can that can be time consuming 

595.57 596.71 B: right 

597.13 604.35 B: [lipsmack] yeah i did teach statistics once so yeah i i've gone through those math homeworks 

599.78 601.27 A: oh yeah 

604.57 610.42 B: [mn] where there's multiple stages and you have to figure which [laughter] parts they got right and which ones are more important to 

609.77 610.69 A: (( uh-huh )) 

611.06 613.51 B: assign values to all that stuff 

612.91 627.58 A: oh yeah yeah that's what i found when i last i've o- i've o- i only teach in the fall so last year when i first started grading i thought i've got to be consistent in this so i had to start writing down wh- how many points i took off on when this student made that mistake 

613.99 615.29 B: (( so mhm )) 

625.36 626.53 B: right 

626.93 634.54 B: 'cause if you don't then two best friends will have the same answer and [laughter] come see you and why did he get four and i got five 

631.75 637.58 A: [laughter] [laughter] i like him better [laughter] 

635.64 638.80 B: (( yeah [laughter] yup )) 

638.58 642.53 A: [laughter] that would be pretty mean 

639.30 640.74 B: definitely 

642.32 644.54 B: yeah i don't think that's right 

643.98 646.07 A: no no you probably don't 

645.07 648.13 B: i wonder how much we're supposed to stay on our topic 

647.54 649.64 A: [mn] i was just wondering that too 

648.79 652.05 B: [laughter] 'cause i'm like how long has this call been 

651.73 654.48 A: ah yeah how long is it supposed to be i haven't rea- 

654.02 656.45 B: i th- i thought it was supposed to be ten minutes 

655.97 656.94 A: yeah 

656.87 658.80 B: i don't know how long we've been talking 

658.87 662.01 A: ah i've got twelve minutes on my phone 

661.29 662.34 B: (( though ah )) 

662.06 666.18 A: but it probably took a little time to set things up because i had to 

666.21 668.11 A: try to find my p._i._n. number 

666.29 667.27 B: right 

667.82 669.19 B: oh yeah 

668.63 671.67 A: i- it was in my email i had to go find my email 

671.97 675.11 A: i was surprised that they didn't hang up on me but [mn] 

676.29 679.52 A: i thought that they cut th- the call off after a little while 

676.33 677.31 B: (( [mn] oh ah )) 

680.45 682.09 A: after the time is over 

681.85 683.17 B: yeah i think so 

683.25 684.14 B: (( i don't know )) 

684.00 687.50 A: ah wh- what do you want to do keep talking or go ahead and stop 

685.90 693.35 B: [laughter] i don't know what we're supposed to do [laughter] let me see if i can [mn] find any pieces of paper i have here what do they say 

688.36 690.19 A: [laughter] me either 

694.04 697.53 B: oh no i think i left them at home my my email's let 

695.65 696.75 A: oh yeah 

697.60 700.16 B: me see if i have my old emails up here 

701.33 703.41 A: yeah my don't say anything 

703.18 704.19 B: (( they don't [lipsmack] )) 

706.83 709.96 B: maybe that's part of the test [laughter] 

708.17 710.41 A: yeah well they just say ten minutes 

710.07 714.79 B: ten minutes all right well that's probably been ten minutes it was very nice talking to you 

710.67 712.60 A: yeah yeah 

713.93 715.58 A: it was nice talking with you too 

715.03 716.44 B: (( all right )) 

715.81 717.29 A: have a good holiday 

716.85 719.06 B: you too have good grading bye bye 

718.23 719.60 A: (( thanks bye bye ))
