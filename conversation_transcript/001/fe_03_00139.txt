38.71 47.19 B: i don't know it just seems like whatever we were supposed to do about iraq [noise] doesn't seem like the situation has changed since 

42.87 43.69 A: mhm 

47.78 51.31 B: [noise] i don't know it seems like the situation is the same as it has been 

51.69 56.08 B: for about ten years so whatever we should do now 

53.30 54.19 A: yeah 

56.37 62.13 B: we should've been doing it for the past ten years and i think bush is [noise] [mn] 

62.13 63.06 A: yeah 

62.48 65.67 B: using this as a pretext to finish the 

66.34 72.11 B: as a pretext to start a war to finish the war that his father [mn] couldn't finish 

71.96 73.53 A: i think so too 

73.38 74.66 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

73.73 75.03 A: (( and i think ah )) 

75.35 87.94 A: i don't know i think he must be pretty annoyed at the u._n. and all the and canadians and other countries like us who weren't very ah you know necessarily so supportive about about about having a war with iraq so 

87.80 89.02 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

88.64 91.48 A: some people some people think that ah 

92.67 98.92 A: that he's doing this partly to like distract people from the fact that you know the economy in the u._s. isn't good and a 

98.75 99.85 B: yeah 

99.22 101.59 A: war is kind of like i don't know 

102.69 106.30 A: it just gives something people something else to focus on and 

105.82 110.16 B: [noise] [cough] yeah i mean it's i think it's definitely a way for him to [noise] 

110.21 112.13 B: [mn] continue his 

112.21 114.99 B: popularity ride um 

113.88 115.21 A: (( yeah i think )) 

115.68 119.21 B: [noise] but i mean i do think it's true that saddam hussein is 

121.09 121.95 A: (( so i agree no that's )) 

121.13 131.60 B: [mn] not a good leader and is probably developing weapons programs but i think that that can be dealt with within the framework of the united nations and it should be because it's in 

130.10 131.21 A: yeah 

131.91 138.56 B: everyone the united states included long term interest i mean when the united states is looked at 

136.12 137.27 A: (( yeah yeah that's )) 

138.95 141.29 B: [cough] excuse me abroad as [lipsmack] 

139.65 140.65 A: (( right mhm )) 

141.98 147.04 B: as a cowboy nation that imposes its will on everyone else um 

143.52 144.35 A: (( yeah i )) 

146.76 147.56 A: (( think )) 

147.59 148.58 B: it doesn't 

149.11 150.81 B: you know in the short term 

150.86 159.58 B: um the government may accomplish its shore term sh- short term goals but [sigh] in the long run it will backfire [noise] [cough] 

160.28 164.14 A: so too and most canadians are of the opinion yeah you should 

164.18 175.58 A: you know send the u._n. first and what i guess typically we're we're a little we sit on the f- i wouldn't say we sit on the fence about things but ah you know we're definitely very cautious about 

175.75 178.88 A: you know striking up a war with anybody so 

178.61 179.54 B: yeah 

179.44 184.84 A: so most people here support yeah the way things are going now with the weapons inspectors and what not so mm 

184.24 188.46 B: yeah i mean the weapons inspectors i mean that's an interesting thing because 

188.54 191.91 B: um i was reading something about [mn] how 

191.93 199.40 B: they're apparently not particularly well screened like so there it's an international team and

251.31 258.88 A: well i wonder how one i mean what kind of training they would have to go go through for it or where they pull them from i have no idea 

255.45 256.89 B: yeah 

258.47 267.01 B: and it might be that the kind of training that they have you know maybe military people would be just the people that iraq and their allies would 

267.68 272.52 B: would whose qualification ir- iraq and its allies would question 

272.23 273.60 A: mhm

333.58 334.49 A: (( i don't know mhm )) 

334.16 337.19 B: i don't know it just seems like the 

337.52 340.06 B: from statements that have been made by 

339.81 340.71 A: mhm 

340.07 343.16 B: not just people in the um

356.39 357.43 A: mhm 

357.15 358.46 B: but [mn] 

358.55 361.33 B: making public statements like that just 

361.35 362.55 A: yeah

485.62 497.97 A: exact- well and for us as well so they were like okay we don't like him but you know you don't have to say it in front of a microphone for everyone to hear right [laughter] but then ah chretien acted on it he's not always um so very articulate but 

486.46 487.88 B: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

496.34 497.14 B: (( [mn] ))

523.28 524.47 A: [laughter] 

529.87 532.36 B: talking to americans just 'cause it was too 

532.23 533.19 A: well

547.19 548.51 A: oh yeah 

549.20 550.19 A: yeah 

550.73 552.68 A: yeah yeah 

551.79 554.86 B: the canadian prime minister has endorsed you 

554.88 560.41 B: and he's like oh oh yeah i [mn] you know he's a great man that gilles leflore the canadian prime minister 

554.93 555.75 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

557.72 559.00 A: exactly 

560.20 563.64 A: oh i know i remember that too and they were saying like ah 

561.79 566.33 B: [laughter] or like oh no it was like you know um 

566.89 571.90 B: pierre poteen or something [laughter] and i mean 

568.26 573.70 A: yeah [laughter] exactly yeah that's right and he was like oh yeah 

572.71 577.10 B: yeah and he just betrays the fact that he has no idea who the pri- the 

575.74 576.46 A: (( yeah )) 

577.26 580.28 B: canadian prime minister is 

578.31 584.40 A: well they said yeah that it's just [mn] obvious that they think bush is more interested in the relationship with mexico than with 

583.82 587.01 B: yeah well that was another casualty of the um 

587.35 594.48 B: [mn] september eleventh in in august of that year um all over the u._s. press was that um 

594.59 597.60 B: president fox and and and bush that they were 

598.00 612.86 B: [cough] they were working on a plan to legalize a lot of illegal mexican immigrants in the united states and um labor unions supported it and it would be a great boost to the economy and to mexican american relationships and 

610.08 610.85 A: (( mhm oh )) 

612.06 613.20 A: mhm 

612.89 617.18 B: (( um the mexican american relationship but [lipsmack] you know )) 

617.59 620.24 B: then after the attacks you know people just 

618.61 619.39 A: right 

620.61 626.93 A: i thought they rather enjoyed having all these illegal mexican immigrants there 'cause they could pay them like nothing and 

626.42 637.40 B: well that's why the i mean but that's why the labor unions at least at that time pre september eleventh supported legalizing them because then that raises wages for everybody and 

630.69 631.77 A: oh 

632.65 633.54 A: right 

635.87 637.72 A: true enough yeah 

637.48 639.33 B: (( um but )) 

638.77 640.57 A: oh that's a good point mhm 

639.40 642.20 B: [mn] who knows what will happen i mean but now 

642.42 643.55 B: [mn] 

643.58 648.36 B: you know it's understandable in a way that that people are kind of you know 

650.10 660.60 B: kind of like u- uncomfortable with the idea of [noise] i mean i mean i you know i feel like [mn] the mexicans are [laughter] not i 

653.69 654.57 A: yeah 

655.26 656.19 A: (( oh i )) 

660.89 663.73 B: mean they're not a threat right i mean 

662.46 663.18 A: no 

663.40 665.97 A: not really [laughter] i can't imagine but 

665.54 670.74 B: but i mean i suppose it is understandable that people now want to be more cautious 

668.23 669.17 A: (( well you never )) 

669.97 674.07 A: yeah i mean even go- crossing from canada i mean i've crossed a million times over from 

674.29 687.62 A: you know ah like toronto or whatever into the buffalo and and the last time i crossed at the beginning of november i had a had a hell of a time getting in the country i thought oh my god this is the first time ever where it's not you know been so easy you know

691.77 692.78 A: mhm 

691.92 698.45 B: they would if they stopped you at all they'd say like y'all american or canadian and you say yes and then you'd be on your way 

695.66 696.74 A: mhm 

697.34 702.17 A: that was it yeah i remember like last time i didn't have well unfortunately ah 

698.87 699.86 B: um 

702.50 710.07 A: i did not buy a return ticket [laughter] not even really thinking about it you know because it's been so easy in the past and of course that caused all the problems 

706.86 708.30 B: yeah 

709.42 710.83 B: yeah 

710.19 712.45 A: why don't you have this return ticket and ah 

712.27 713.34 B: yeah 

712.74 713.98 A: whatever 

713.65 719.47 B: you know people don't think about this but do you know that um ohio and ontario border each other
