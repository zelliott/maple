55.74 56.17 A: mhm 

56.50 58.28 A: i think uh a lot of people think that 

70.72 74.55 A: well we're supposed to stay on the line for about ten minutes and 

75.33 75.92 A: and uh 

76.01 77.12 A: we're supposed to talk about 

77.61 78.54 A: about the topic 

79.94 80.37 A: so 

80.62 83.15 A: i don't know i'm real interested to hear more about what you think 

83.27 83.61 A: um 

83.97 86.04 A: where you callin- from just out of curiosity what state 

87.28 87.82 A: missouri 

88.95 90.39 A: i'm i'm up here in massachusetts 

93.02 93.39 A: so 

95.94 101.06 A: it's not really all that struc- i mean the only thing we ar- we're supposed to do is talk about the topic and you know 

101.44 105.34 A: i- as long as we stay on that then that that meets the needs for the data collection 

106.00 106.62 A: and uh 

106.73 108.60 A: no i really i'm real curious to hear 

109.02 109.49 A: to hear what 

110.01 112.55 A: what what's on your mind and what people are thinking down 

113.05 114.01 A: you know where you are 

119.37 119.82 A: mhm 

121.64 122.07 A: right 

122.19 122.55 A: right 

126.90 127.99 A: from your city okay 

137.05 137.46 A: right 

140.17 143.17 A: well it's a political topic and so i can imagine that it 

143.50 145.04 A: it could be you know people could have 

145.17 147.15 A: hurt feelings one way or the other depending on how they 

147.55 148.61 A: think about it i imagine 

156.30 157.27 A: right well he better 

157.80 159.07 A: ha ha ha 

162.45 164.23 A: right right well i know a lot of people 

164.35 165.19 A: agree with you 

166.27 166.89 A: on on this 

173.06 177.77 A: you know i just put it i haven't i w- i the latest i saw was that the inspectors 

178.04 180.07 A: had gone in and that they had prepared 

180.58 182.94 A: a draft of of of their findings 

183.62 184.23 A: and 

184.48 185.29 A: that uh 

185.84 187.95 A: the u._s. response was skeptical 

188.45 190.90 A: and thought that there we- were probably things that were 

191.39 192.30 A: were uh were hidden 

193.19 195.66 A: and uh so i think that's that's the last i heard 

196.27 198.04 A: but uh did you look at the newspaper this morning 

203.41 204.78 A: yeah ha ha ha ha ha 

209.09 210.02 A: yeah i know what you mean it's 

212.06 212.57 A: mhm 

216.66 217.09 A: mhm 

219.31 221.38 A: oh oh well of course that's true that's right 

223.07 226.31 A: but i know what you mean it's negative it's uh you know negative news in the news- 

226.43 226.82 A: -paper 

226.92 227.55 A: that's for sure 

228.39 230.58 A: are people are people out there concerned about 

230.73 231.12 A: um 

231.24 232.80 A: loss of life on our part i the 

232.91 233.87 A: united states' part 

234.52 237.59 A: you think the young men and women who'll have to go over there and fight that 

250.53 250.99 A: right 

255.95 260.06 A: i know and then this sounds like it's less and less likely the from what i understand of it 

260.62 263.11 A: it's not the kind of situation where you can do that 

273.13 273.58 A: mhm 

274.02 275.99 A: i did hear something about that about uh 

276.74 277.52 A: new targets 

289.24 289.67 A: right 

297.24 297.68 A: right 

298.26 298.66 A: right 

300.11 301.42 A: right so you think there's 

301.59 304.54 A: probably a pretty strong connection between al qaeda and iraq 

310.06 314.73 A: well see that's the thing that has me wonder- like it seems to me like the strongest connections are to saudi arabia 

333.07 333.50 A: you mean if 

333.59 335.86 A: for example the u._s. were to take them both on 

339.35 339.77 A: mhm 

340.11 341.66 A: you think that might be a higher cost 

351.49 351.92 A: mhm 

358.33 359.80 A: you think maybe they're more isolated 

365.64 366.04 A: mhm 

367.36 368.27 A: well i certainly think they've 

368.38 369.66 A: they've made their share of enemies 

378.93 381.60 A: oh i i'm um i'm one of the researchers 

395.17 401.15 A: well generally yeah i i'm being studied i volunteered um the people who yeah the people who um 

401.31 403.48 A: get the the advertisements they they get 

404.08 408.09 A: some kind of compensation i think it it's not a lot but it is something and a chance to win 

408.39 408.96 A: i think people 

409.22 413.70 A: pick whether they want a um a certain a- amount of dollars or a chance to win a bigger amount 

414.20 415.95 A: we don't get anything but we d- we're uh 

416.64 422.39 A: they need to get as many people as they can so i just volunteered and i'm on the same exact level as you on this 

424.22 425.82 A: so i'm just a i'm a i'm another 

426.15 426.48 A: um 

427.87 434.61 A: i was going to say guinea pig but uh yeah i was going to say guinea pig but we're just donating our uh in fact you're helping 

434.77 436.42 A: in the in the overall 

436.59 437.15 A: effort 

437.26 438.40 A: we you know in terms of 

438.92 439.51 A: helping 

439.91 440.37 A: study 

440.78 441.33 A: how uh 

441.61 441.99 A: uh 

443.09 444.58 A: conversations can be transcribed 

445.56 447.62 A: so that's very (( mhm )) very glad you've called in 

456.03 456.45 A: mhm 

460.83 461.34 A: all right 

466.97 471.87 A: that's wonderful that's wonderful i we should stay on the topic of iraq just i'm only mentioning that 

473.32 474.37 A: it is it's a tough one 

475.67 476.09 A: it is 

477.25 478.47 A: especially a political one 

486.21 486.60 A: right 

486.88 487.34 A: right 

492.05 493.98 A: i hear you but i think you're doing a wonderful job 

494.41 495.01 A: you really are 

498.34 500.92 A: it's my second one i i had one where we w- we asked 

501.03 503.23 A: b- i i shouldn't mention it it'll throw us off -cause 

503.71 504.95 A: part of the thing is huh 

505.39 507.08 A: but it was a related topic 

508.58 512.01 A: so let's see we've probably still got a couple minutes here about iraq 

512.73 513.20 A: um 

513.97 517.45 A: i know one of the things people talked about was the time frame on that whether 

518.00 520.89 A: at a certain time it's going to be too cold too hot over there 

520.99 522.09 A: for our troops to go in 

522.40 522.65 A: so 

522.95 526.03 A: there is a certain amount of pressure to have any action happen 

526.29 527.21 A: during the colder months 

528.17 529.41 A: do you think that might be a factor 

547.19 553.46 A: my -cause if ther- if they were t- pr- to protect themselves against the different uh biological weapons they would need to be pretty well suited 

553.94 554.58 A: it was uh 

554.68 555.89 A: protection i think that's uh 

49.78 51.49 B: i think there's probably pretty good 

52.31 53.52 B: likelihood that there's 

53.83 55.65 B: that they're just real good at hiding them 

59.09 59.52 B: mhm 

61.56 61.94 B: well 

63.09 63.90 B: it's ha 

63.99 67.16 B: as far as i'm concerned i've said my whole opinion is there 

67.51 71.23 B: are we supposed to stay on the line until somebody tells us to quit or 

74.88 75.54 B: okay 

78.96 79.65 B: okay 

86.62 87.73 B: missouri and where 

87.95 88.76 B: and where are you from 

90.87 92.57 B: oh okay okay 

92.98 94.51 B: wasn't sure just how this all 

94.79 95.92 B: this whole thing works 

100.50 101.27 B: hm mhm 

105.77 106.35 B: mhm 

114.17 114.66 B: mhm 

115.73 116.18 B: well 

116.51 117.85 B: pretty much you know this is 

118.22 119.51 B: the bible belt and 

119.80 121.60 B: people are pretty conservative and 

122.83 124.42 B: john ashcroft is from 

124.54 125.24 B: our state 

125.39 126.79 B: as a matter of fact from our city 

127.70 129.85 B: yeah so i mean it's just um 

131.29 131.59 B: ah 

131.82 133.61 B: i don't know it's not something that i 

133.99 135.21 B: talk about with my 

135.68 136.27 B: colleagues 

136.42 137.60 B: a lot uh 

138.56 139.14 B: because 

139.26 139.79 B: ah 

142.01 143.87 B: yeah so you avoid it 

147.59 148.05 B: yeah 

148.87 149.29 B: right 

149.66 150.11 B: right 

150.96 156.83 B: an- uh main- mainly i probably just talk about it with my husband because i know he already agrees with me so that way 

157.39 160.14 B: huh yeah ha so that way we don't 

160.96 162.21 B: you know if i talked about it 

162.80 163.54 B: to other people 

165.85 166.40 B: mhm 

168.21 168.68 B: yeah 

169.40 170.37 B: well um

188.30 188.81 B: mhm 

193.13 193.80 B: right 

199.56 204.21 B: well you know i did but i probably just read the funny papers so i mean huh 

204.61 208.99 B: that's a as far as i'm concerned that's that's part of the paper all the rest of the paper makes me depressed 

209.47 216.42 B: but i usually read the funny papers and ann landers although i don't go if it's ann landers (( i- )) well not ann landers anymore even 

216.89 217.39 B: uh 

217.68 219.68 B: it's only dear abby now 

221.02 221.59 B: yeah 

221.74 223.36 B: so anywa- yeah um 

226.97 227.49 B: right 

228.22 228.91 B: right 

238.67 242.10 B: i don't know no i haven't heard people talking about that the although that 

242.28 246.24 B: that's the main thing you hear about in the newspaper it's like the united states want's to 

246.71 248.48 B: fight a war without anybody 

248.91 250.78 B: on our side getting killed and 

252.00 253.63 B: i don't know i don- i haven't 

253.87 255.74 B: ever seen anything like that happen 

256.85 257.12 B: in 

262.40 265.04 B: oh you know i did hear something either on um 

266.14 267.42 B: good morning america 

267.91 269.26 B: this morning something about 

269.65 273.03 B: i think there has been a a a message from al qaeda 

275.31 275.68 B: that 

276.10 277.50 B: i didn't hear i didn't hear th- 

277.92 280.20 B: huh yeah i didn't hear the beginning but 

280.78 281.37 B: uh 

282.02 283.04 B: stressing the fact 

283.22 283.68 B: that 

284.73 285.43 B: uh 

286.16 288.98 B: there was going to be great economic disruption 

290.13 291.58 B: at the heart of 

292.05 292.65 B: an- i didn't 

293.03 295.31 B: you know but because i missed the first part of the message 

296.32 297.92 B: i didn't hear exactly 

299.20 300.25 B: what it was going to be 

305.44 307.41 B: oh yeah i think so and between 

307.83 310.75 B: al qaeda and saudi arabia apparently i mean most of 

314.79 316.75 B: yeah and i don't know what the 

317.80 319.55 B: what what it is that keeps 

319.65 321.04 B: the u._s. back from 

322.04 324.41 B: challenging saudi arabia i guess 

325.54 326.02 B: i guess 

326.62 327.06 B: the 

327.57 328.62 B: huge extent 

328.86 329.63 B: of the 

330.53 332.54 B: of the conflict that would be involved 

336.58 339.26 B: yeah or even saudi arabia instead of iraq 

340.11 340.59 B: (( exit )) 

342.35 344.92 B: yeah i think so i think there's much 

345.06 346.07 B: and and 

346.43 347.72 B: much more likelihood of the 

348.74 349.04 B: wide 

349.18 351.27 B: spread involvement of other countries 

352.27 353.62 B: pitching in where i think 

355.03 355.57 B: you know 

355.69 357.84 B: maybe iraq is something that could be 

360.62 363.33 B: yeah i think the arab world even doesn't uh 

363.73 365.52 B: doesn't think too highly of them 

370.21 370.66 B: yes 

371.87 372.25 B: yes 

375.56 377.22 B: well anyway how did you hear about this 

377.60 378.46 B: study anyway 

381.96 384.02 B: oh you are okay i 

384.29 388.85 B: thought no i wasn't sure from the way the questions were um 

389.05 390.20 B: worded if 

390.31 390.73 B: it was 

390.94 392.08 B: two people 

393.34 394.99 B: a- who were being studied 

397.69 398.58 B: oh okay 

405.69 406.26 B: uh-huh 

406.60 407.38 B: uh-huh yeah

465.78 466.95 B: be involved in 

468.46 468.73 B: -cause
