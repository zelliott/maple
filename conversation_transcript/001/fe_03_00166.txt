83.23 89.21 B: a little something that forces everybody to rest no stores no shopping can be done 

86.14 87.28 A: yeah 

89.64 93.49 A: yeah you have to sit at home with your family and do mostly nothing

126.73 128.47 B: [laughter] 

128.01 129.49 A: and he uh 

130.04 134.53 A: his family had big lights on his christmas tree and i had the little tiny lights 

134.76 139.21 A: and so we have to alternate christmases about who gets the lights on the tree 

138.78 140.37 B: very interesting 

139.90 144.72 A: [laughter] like very it's a uh it is a 

145.12 149.43 A: we we've negotiated a settlement so we're fine [laughter] 

148.39 154.20 B: [laughter] i'm glad to hear that i come from a family that likes to 

149.91 150.87 A: yeah 

154.21 163.49 B: sort of stay in the house together for twenty four hours and it drives my husband insane 'cause he comes from a very small family and he's not used to so many people around 

160.89 162.18 A: (( oh )) 

163.31 169.79 A: yeah yeah i was from one of those too where you know like thanksgiving was twenty people in the house and 

169.81 175.71 A: eating and running around and then all th- all ten guys end up in front of the t._v. asleep 

175.87 177.80 A: watching the football game 

175.88 177.27 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

178.96 179.84 A: (( yeah )) 

179.92 183.00 A: so that was that was kind of my family holidays 

183.64 187.08 A: and we also have the negotiation of who gets who at christmas 

187.60 189.84 A: [lipsmack] in our families so right now 

189.97 192.63 A: it's uh we're going to my family for 

192.89 196.52 A: christmas since my family's in illinois and his is in baltimore 

195.80 196.71 B: wow 

196.81 199.44 A: so we're kind of all over [sigh] 

200.29 203.39 B: that's a long way to go especially with kids 

203.03 208.39 A: yeah yeah we just have one but she's three and driving all the way to illinois 

208.26 210.36 B: it's a long drive [laughter] 

209.46 212.67 A: very [laughter] long drive for a three year old 

213.14 214.06 A: so 

214.82 223.80 B: no well we don't have any children but we try to keep the driving to a minimum since we're the only people in the area we always have to drive somewhere 

224.06 225.79 A: (( oh yeah )) 

225.31 226.38 B: so 

227.34 228.95 A: yeah we did that too 

229.70 232.21 A: until three years ago [laughter] 

232.13 235.68 B: [laughter] and then everybody had to see the grandchild it's 

234.52 246.59 A: yes that was nice for a while and then but but we still end up traveling a lot somehow [sigh] you know like my my mom would put up the money so we could go see her and [laughter] and things like that [sigh] 

246.74 247.73 A: so 

247.41 250.14 B: funny how parents do that 

249.55 251.01 A: yeah 

250.19 251.52 B: the bribe [laughter] 

251.35 254.01 A: yes it works [laughter] 

254.56 256.14 A: and then uh 

257.26 260.00 A: but my husband's going to seminary right now 

259.05 260.43 B: (( oh okay )) 

260.21 263.61 A: [lipsmack] so pretty soon everybody's gonna come to see us at christmas 

263.55 265.22 B: i would hope so 

264.83 266.90 A: yeah [laughter] 

265.36 268.82 B: [laughter] 'cause he'll be working [laughter] 

267.25 269.91 A: he'll be working [laughter] 

269.11 271.08 B: do you go to u. penn as well 

271.24 273.28 A: uh no i go to uh 

273.41 277.92 A: i'm i'm a new professor at university of pittsburgh at greensburg 

277.56 278.56 B: (( oh wow )) 

278.97 279.85 A: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

280.25 286.77 A: i heard about this on the the a a linguistic child language requisition list 

287.16 288.40 A: and uh 

289.02 296.46 A: don't know a whole lot about the study i i'm assuming it has something to do with computer transcription of voice or or something like that 

296.96 299.39 A: but uh other than that i don't know 

299.25 304.76 B: mhm that's possible i'm also wondering i'm gonna keep track for myself uh 

305.98 312.77 B: [mn] the the sex of the people that i'm paired with i'm wondering if they're looking for discourse interchange 

312.02 315.37 A: yeah that's the that's the other possibility is 

314.75 320.36 B: between s- you know sex or same sex and that kind of thing 

318.52 322.62 A: yeah so far i've only had two calls and they were both women so 

321.64 326.73 B: oh i've had one man and one woman [laughter] you and and a gentleman 

323.66 325.29 A: [laughter] 

326.55 327.61 A: yeah 

326.94 329.80 B: and uh so it's interesting 

329.66 330.60 A: (( yeah )) 

330.57 331.73 B: i don't know 

331.89 335.92 B: i could in some ways need a vacation from the holidays 

336.02 339.03 A: yeah although right now i'm 

339.14 348.25 A: i'm uh giving finals so [sigh] i get a week off before we start traveling for holidays so that'll be nice where i have a a whole week with no work 

347.50 350.34 B: oh that you don't go right to the bitter end 

350.02 355.42 A: no no fortunately my husband will be his his classes go till 

355.63 359.15 A: the twentieth and then we're gonna be driving that weekend but uh 

358.04 358.83 B: (( oh )) 

359.49 362.29 A: you'd think at a seminary they'd give you more time off at christmas 

363.08 363.83 A: but 

365.21 366.16 A: (( oh well )) 

365.97 370.18 B: no our university will be open on the twenty fourth 

370.25 371.21 A: (( ooh )) 

370.85 372.05 B: yeah 

371.59 372.72 A: are you 

372.73 374.76 A: professor staff are you 

374.30 377.73 B: i'm staff and i'm a student in the linguistics 

377.93 378.93 A: (( oh )) 

377.95 379.10 B: department 

379.36 380.82 B: and uh 

381.20 385.58 B: a graduate student i'm almost done i have to do my research project now 

385.41 386.49 A: ooh 

386.22 387.96 B: yeah a lot of fun 

387.72 389.37 A: so what's your research on 

389.01 397.26 B: [laughter] well it depends [laughter] it's if it works out i'll probably looking at prosodic phrasing 

391.03 392.41 A: [laughter] 

397.16 398.18 A: mhm 

397.35 400.34 B: uh in a um 

400.91 403.12 B: corpus of read speech 

403.81 405.44 B: and um 

406.45 411.15 B: trying to test someone's conclusions from a paper wonderful 

410.55 411.83 A: right 

411.34 420.44 B: and see if they hold true for a different type of uh corpus so a person that had looked at performed speech dr- a dramatic reading 

419.69 421.06 A: oh right 

420.63 426.21 B: and uh so i'm gonna see if it's different with just sort of read speech yeah 

424.36 425.77 A: conversational 

426.76 430.34 B: so i'll see what happens i don't know i don't know if i'm going to find 

430.69 433.05 B: enough of what i'm looking for 

433.11 434.04 A: right 

434.31 436.27 B: so i might have to do something else 

434.89 440.56 A: it never comes out the way you predict it never even comes out the way that your advisers predict 

440.64 444.84 A: i've found so well when i did mine [laughter] i just finished mine 

441.38 442.84 B: really 

444.33 445.76 B: your dissertation 

445.10 448.40 A: yeah i'm gonna be writing it up for publication um 

447.48 449.16 B: oh wow what was it on 

449.19 455.51 A: on uh children's language erudition and how they learn what a verb means especially verbs like thinking 

455.80 461.64 A: or discovering that like you can't really see you can't point to thinking very easily 

458.50 459.49 B: mhm 

461.70 471.15 A: and it's very difficult to draw it [laughter] 'cause i had the little you know i showed the little pictures to tell 'em a story and it's very difficult to kind of you know 

471.24 474.04 A: depict thinking on a page for them 

474.36 475.72 A: but um 

476.84 483.47 A: but um it ended up there was a third factor that nobody had thought of until the results came out [sigh] so 

483.21 484.36 B: well that's cool 

484.10 485.88 A: yeah 

485.74 487.16 B: that's very cool 

486.52 497.85 A: kinda tied everything together but it meant that i should've picked older kids [laughter] so it was like oh well it's interesting it's something to do for the next summer's research but uh 

499.13 502.81 A: obviously they gave me my my degree but 

503.75 505.10 A: (( but yeah )) 

504.62 507.06 B: well that's good um 

505.81 506.97 A: mhm 

509.36 511.34 B: did you graduate from 

511.83 513.78 B: uh in pennsylvania or 

512.94 515.44 A: no uh university of massachusetts 

514.97 516.13 B: oh wow 

516.31 517.21 A: so 

516.91 519.89 B: well that's nice that you were able are you tenure tracked 

519.80 521.38 A: no i wish 

520.84 522.85 B: [laughter] 

521.96 529.48 A: [laughter] but my husband's going to seminary so we're we may try to pick up and move everybody at the same time when he's done 

529.04 530.36 B: mhm 

529.57 532.13 A: and try for a tenure tracked job so 

533.05 534.97 B: well that would be good 

534.18 539.42 A: and then that would be hopefully the last move but pastors tend to move more often than 

539.87 542.00 A: (( [sigh] than um [lipsmack] )) 

542.14 543.53 A: professors do 

543.17 545.27 B: that's true now he's lutheran 

544.96 546.07 A: (( yes yes )) 

547.34 550.40 A: so they're very into christmas and they're very into 

551.01 553.53 A: the meaning of advent not 

553.61 561.84 A: advent is the time to get your house decorated and get the cookies made and and the presents wrapped [laughter] which is what everybody else thinks it is [sigh] so 

557.57 558.96 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

560.89 566.59 B: that's true my husband is from a methodist background so 

564.84 566.40 A: mhm 

566.68 571.72 B: i i don't come from a very religious background so it's just interesting 

569.34 570.47 A: mhm 

571.66 573.05 A: yeah 

572.35 576.61 B: his focus is sort of very sort of quiet introspective holiday 

576.50 577.63 A: mhm 

576.92 578.28 B: and uh 

579.06 580.57 B: i come from a compl- 

580.81 583.48 B: hundred and eighty degrees in the other direction 

582.69 584.44 A: right right 

585.09 587.29 A: (( yeah and for them it's still )) 

587.39 590.86 A: a big family event on christmas it's just that 

589.00 590.29 B: mhm 

591.01 598.35 A: the advent time is supposed to be a time of preparing and watching and waiting for jesus and 

598.34 609.58 A: getting yourself ready for christmas and i of course think of getting myself ready for christmas as getting the cards out and [laughter] shopping done and [sigh] not a whole lot of time for 

605.04 606.88 B: mhm 

607.79 610.64 B: are you ready to be a minister's wife 

610.49 621.14 A: no [laughter] not really [laughter] not really at all no i uh i've been thinking about that a lot lately he just started this fall so 

611.18 613.43 B: [laughter] 

621.68 630.16 A: [sigh] yeah thinking about what that's gonna mean for me and our kids i mean we only have one right now but we're hoping to have more than one and 

627.20 628.53 B: mhm 

630.29 633.53 A: [mn] and uh what that all is gonna be like i have no idea 

633.69 639.31 A: i've watched peter's dad is actually a minister and peter tried very hard to not become a minister 

638.70 639.65 B: mhm 

639.41 643.23 A: uh but ended up doing it anyway [laughter] um 

640.87 642.48 B: [laughter] 

643.31 646.65 A: just 'cause he couldn't find anything else that meant anything to him 

647.02 649.40 A: so he uh 

650.91 652.88 A: i've been watching his mom 

652.56 653.85 B: mhm 

653.18 655.35 A: and and trying to learn from her 

655.83 657.83 A: on how she handles it 

657.79 659.20 B: it's tough 

658.75 660.16 A: yeah 

659.51 660.54 B: um 

660.70 674.62 B: i know my husband's childhood church the minister's wife he's still there methodist ministers are supposed to move every two years but he's been at the same church for like over twenty years it's a very unusual 

670.19 671.00 A: oh 

672.91 673.75 A: (( oh )) 

674.51 675.52 A: right 

675.07 676.35 B: arrangement 

676.36 677.87 B: and um 

678.05 683.21 B: she's completely withdrawn from church life she got so tired of the politics [laughter] 

682.76 684.68 A: oh yeah it's horrible 

683.98 688.28 B: of the parishioners she couldn't take she was just became very disgusted by it 

687.96 688.95 A: (( mm )) 

688.30 690.98 B: and just stopped attending altogether 

690.78 691.65 A: (( yeah i'm )) 

691.71 693.11 B: and uh 

692.80 702.30 A: hoping i never get that far i just wanna make sure that i don't end up on every committee and directing the choir and [laughter] you know organizing the bake sales and whatever 

697.76 699.90 B: [laughter] 

702.41 704.81 A: i'm trying to avoid that 

704.99 706.74 A: particular aspect 

706.27 709.18 B: a balance of involvement 

707.17 708.01 A: yes 

708.22 710.00 A: yes it it will be 

710.01 713.08 A: it will be harder to be i think 

713.46 719.89 A: a spiritual person if the only person i ever listen to is my own husband preaching 

718.50 719.43 B: (( mm ))
