0.48 1.64 A: (( hello )) 

1.13 2.26 B: hello 

2.38 3.56 B: i'm debbie 

2.48 3.37 A: hi 

3.52 5.61 A: hi i'm sam nice to meet you 

5.66 6.92 B: oh nice to meet you 

8.12 11.61 B: so we answer the question or [laughter] 

9.62 12.69 A: i guess so this is the first one i've done 

12.07 14.00 B: okay this is the first one for me too 

14.45 15.74 B: so what do you think 

17.62 19.99 A: i think that um 

20.40 27.83 A: arms inspections in iraq is a false issue that's being created to draw attention away from other things 

28.01 36.45 A: on um the political landscape uh and especially so for the the recent congressional elections 

37.33 46.38 B: hm that's interesting i haven't um caught up on my news too much so i've only heard a little bit about what's been going on 

44.30 45.32 A: mhm 

46.43 47.89 B: but i think it's 

48.46 51.65 B: i don't know i don't know why we're so con- well 

52.05 62.56 B: we can't really control it we have no right to control it but i mean it is an issue because they could do so much with all of their weapons i guess 

62.81 64.75 B: which could involve us but 

65.37 66.80 B: uh it's a 

66.93 68.60 B: tough territory too 

68.76 72.74 A: [mn] [sigh] well yeah i think uh touchy subjects are the ones that they 

72.85 76.41 A: they picked i it 

77.41 77.97 A: (( [sigh] )) 

78.23 84.29 A: i haven't been reading the news recently either just because it's been making me very sick um 

82.36 83.36 B: mhm 

85.28 91.72 A: but it seemed as though they would ask for a certain amount and then 

92.10 98.22 A: at one point iraq said okay we're willing to meet your demands and then all they did was up um 

98.99 109.54 A: was um increase increased their demands and so i think that it's very contrived and they don't actually have 

102.58 103.59 B: mhm 

110.80 114.07 A: any interest in um 

115.25 119.30 A: making the world safer or doing the right thing um 

119.46 121.30 A: what they're interested in 

121.18 129.40 A: is getting everyone to pay attention to that as an issue rather than to the economy as an issue 

129.28 137.77 A: or to the fact that no one has done anything about um what was discovered in the election of two thousand um 

137.82 142.04 A: which is which was that the um 

142.39 145.03 A: voting process is totally corrupt 

146.54 149.96 B: wh- what do you mean by that or or how elaborate 

150.24 153.89 A: elaborate on the the corrupt voting process well just 

151.32 152.69 B: the the voting 

153.92 155.25 A: um 

155.66 170.35 A: [sigh] it w- [sigh] it was sort of bl- it was blatantly [noise] shown that overseas ballots were sent in after election day with the postmarks changed and um 

165.80 166.76 B: mhm 

167.52 168.71 B: yeah 

172.27 177.05 A: voting sites in heavily black areas were demolished 

176.95 191.90 A: and the um people who were supposed to be voting there were not notified some people actually showed up to empty holes in the ground um to vote and they had no idea where to go other people were um 

191.91 200.62 A: labelled felons randomly and they weren't allowed to vote there were all there were all sorts of different systems that that came up when the system uh when the um 

201.90 203.21 A: the voting 

203.29 212.53 A: um bureaucracy was put under close scrutiny for preventing people from voting and um skewing the results 

206.50 207.41 B: mhm 

213.31 220.31 A: and no one has done anything about that i mean it was a huge issue for a very short time [cough] 

220.73 224.12 A: and the supreme court decision um 

225.17 226.76 A: suggested 

226.87 240.28 A: that voting was an equal protection thing which implies that no one should be able to vote on machines of different types everyone in the country should vote on a machine of the same o- of the same type 

237.45 239.14 B: equal yeah 

239.63 240.55 B: uh-huh 

240.11 246.81 A: because some machines are um fairer than others and um some machines are much better at 

246.89 250.94 A: actually having the vote count as the voter intended it to 

251.14 252.53 A: but then 

253.55 260.16 A: there was the attack on new york and since then nobody's really cared about that at all 

256.64 257.57 B: mhm 

260.22 273.20 A: and the attack on new york you know was obviously incredibly serious and it um but it drew people's attention away from other stuff uh and the voting thing is just 

260.57 261.45 B: mhm 

273.19 277.09 A: what i think is the biggest there are lots of other things that are going on that i'm really 

275.61 280.92 B: so this weapons inspections is just an excuse not to deal with our problems huh 

277.17 283.16 A: not happy with it's it's a way of prolonging it it's well it's a way of prolonging it 

282.58 284.13 B: mhm 

283.39 286.37 A: and of um continuing 

287.61 291.03 A: the power that has been granted the president i mean he 

291.06 291.82 A: he was 

291.90 294.82 A: (( granted )) 

296.37 299.36 A: so much power just um 

297.56 298.74 B: mhm 

300.40 305.28 A: to to go into afghanistan and take out the taliban 

305.75 308.31 A: um but now that that's over 

308.67 312.23 A: he doesn't want to give that up his ability to just march in 

311.59 313.24 B: yeah well yeah 

312.39 314.96 A: anywhere with a blank check from congress 

314.60 316.08 B: i think yeah 

315.54 318.03 A: and so you have to keep your momentum 

317.36 318.43 B: mhm 

318.08 320.61 A: and i think that's part of it as well 

320.01 326.22 B: yeah that he couldn't he cannot find osama bin laden and he doesn't know whether he's dead or alive 

324.74 327.45 A: right and rather than be viewed as impotent 

326.60 329.49 B: yeah yeah i agree with that 

330.33 334.47 B: um but yeah that voting thing is an 

334.58 338.03 B: interesting point that you bring up i haven't thought about that 

337.52 340.71 A: well it i mean it's just an example i think 

338.77 339.57 B: really 

341.52 355.04 A: it was mainly to manufacture an issue for the congressional elections because if you look at what normally happens when you have a republican president you have a democratic congress and vice versa and we don't have that right now 

345.71 346.88 B: mhm 

352.88 353.91 B: mhm 

354.58 355.86 B: mhm 

355.24 360.98 A: and i think that the reason is that the republican party has been 

361.05 362.27 A: um 

362.87 365.68 A: creating this enormous smokescreen 

365.99 367.94 A: by um 

368.98 379.05 A: thrusting iraq in everyone's faces and making it look as though their platform which includes this whole homeland defense thing is incredibly incredibly important 

378.87 385.12 A: and i don't think iraq is any more threatening now than it was before and i think that if anything [cough] 

385.45 387.15 A: if it is more threatening 

387.25 394.56 A: it's because we have this brand new policy of um the war on terrorism 

394.69 408.57 A: and marching in all over the world even more than we did before [noise] and just taking out random groups of people i mean if you wanna talk about terrorism the c._i._a. itself could be considered a terrorist organization um 

404.86 406.75 B: (( yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah )) 

408.19 409.18 B: definitely 

408.96 410.62 A: but 

411.57 413.35 A: that's the sort of thing 

414.33 416.61 A: that's the reason why 

417.28 422.31 A: all of these people hate america is because america is presumptuous enough to just sort of 

422.34 426.81 B: step in and think that we're like so right about everything 

423.16 424.56 A: step in and 

425.60 429.46 A: right and and decide right it's this self righteous 

427.17 428.07 B: yeah 

429.84 430.77 B: mhm 

429.92 434.20 A: crap that gets people so pissed off at us in the first place 

434.28 437.65 A: so i don't think it's gonna make the situation any better 

438.73 448.02 B: yeah i have to say i did not vote in this last election [laughter] i feel really bad um i didn't register in time so 

443.65 445.42 A: yeah i didn't either 

447.51 448.37 A: (( mm )) 

448.50 454.30 A: i did i never got my absentee ballot 'cause i registered to vote in in my home state 

453.72 454.95 B: mhm 

455.30 457.80 A: um and not not here at college 

457.99 462.54 B: um so that last election they never even counted the absentee ballots right 

463.42 465.03 A: i don't think so 

465.12 467.15 A: they usually don't unless there 

465.20 468.57 B: i mean and plus the stuff in florida i d- i mean i don't like 

467.94 471.17 A: yeah well unless there are enough of them to make a difference 

470.55 472.01 B: yeah 

471.46 477.86 A: if there i think they don't bother to count them if there unless there are enough of them to um 

477.95 479.65 A: change the balance 

479.18 480.37 B: mhm 

481.14 484.47 A: (( but uh what was i gonna say )) 

486.31 489.71 A: [sigh] i just i don't know i think it's a huge mistake 

490.19 491.14 A: um 

491.77 494.13 A: and i think that it's reactionist 

493.52 495.86 B: to our initial issue about the 

496.45 499.04 B: inspections weapon inspections or 

498.49 500.04 A: no i think i mean 

500.18 501.81 A: (( it's not the )) 

503.41 513.99 A: the people that are behind it that are saying let's let's put ourselves behind this to create a smokescreen and distract attention from what we should be paying it to 

513.79 514.73 B: mhm 

514.11 515.25 A: um 

515.45 519.29 A: are not the only people that support it and i think another 

519.56 521.23 A: issue is that 

521.44 524.13 A: it's a very reactionist thing to do 

524.90 539.25 A: you know we were we were hit and we were hit very badly and for the first time in a long time and you know we're just sort of blindly swinging now and people people want to have their 

539.44 542.74 A: um their re- their sense of revenge 

542.57 543.49 B: mhm 

542.87 543.99 A: assuaged 

544.32 548.83 A: they wanna they wanna be satisfied that you know 

544.45 545.55 B: mhm 

550.69 556.61 A: they're getting the people that hate america and they wanna be satisfied that they're safe 

557.47 558.87 B: yeah 

558.73 571.68 A: you know and i don't think that this is gonna increase the actual safety but i think people want to feel as though the nation is doing something and so they want to see fighter planes on television 

567.83 568.82 B: mhm 

572.00 574.25 A: and not in the skies over new york 

576.89 577.75 B: (( hm )) 

581.54 583.50 B: i don't know it's a very 

583.84 585.43 B: troubling issue 

585.43 586.85 A: yeah 

586.38 589.99 B: i'm always back and forth it's kind of depressing at the same time 

590.06 591.73 B: [laughter] 

590.29 591.41 A: yeah i 

591.97 592.53 A: (( [sigh] )) 

593.78 595.27 A: i um 

595.60 601.30 B: more and more i think about um i i'm definitely not a republican but um 

599.77 600.70 A: mhm 

602.26 603.08 B: uh 

603.46 610.69 B: i i feel really sad that i did not vote in the last election and this recent election um involving my state 

610.65 612.08 A: involving what 

611.23 613.75 B: [noise] my state with the um

641.24 647.92 B: dick [laughter] but um he really doesn't know what he's doing and i mean he's 

642.12 643.22 A: [laughter] 

648.99 654.79 B: he's awful i mean i can't i could go on and on but i won't but and
