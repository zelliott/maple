59.93 61.56 B: in one way and then ended up 

62.42 64.83 B: changing your mind or do you feel about (( )) 

63.83 70.68 A: well i mean this is one of those topics where you know i kno- i know a lot of people in in my line of work have very strong opinions about it 

87.97 92.23 A: forceful advocacy is not really where where i am i don't think at this moment what do you think about it 

92.57 92.95 B: well 

93.45 94.75 B: odd so the question is 

96.15 96.84 B: uh 

96.97 102.49 B: should disarming iraq be a major priority that was one of the que- like that was one of the questions and another one was 

102.82 105.01 B: uh you know what what do you think about 

105.21 105.52 B: armed 

105.65 106.93 B: -spections for iraq right 

106.61 107.31 A: right 

107.07 108.15 B: that's basically it 

107.89 108.26 A: mhm 

108.70 109.41 B: uh 

109.78 112.40 B: you know it's uh in general i i think disarmament 

112.97 115.07 B: should be a major priority for everyone 

114.92 115.53 A: right 

115.37 116.37 B: and uh 

116.94 117.59 B: and then 

118.54 121.96 B: perhaps for arms inspections for iraq you know i think it was uh 

123.03 124.82 B: you know a term of the surrender 

125.37 125.76 B: that 

126.11 126.70 B: they real- 

126.24 129.10 A: you mean back in the gulf war of nineteen ninety one right 

127.68 129.26 B: yeah that you know that 

129.42 131.06 B: that they didn't abide by and 

131.32 132.47 B: you know it's been 

132.92 133.32 B: sort of 

133.67 136.54 B: they've got away with it for a long time and everything like that so 

136.64 137.03 B: that's 

137.67 138.92 B: and i kind of feel like well 

139.65 146.23 B: you know that's not such a bad thing to you know i i'd i'd be interested to know if the tables were turned you know how many countries would allow 

146.79 148.69 B: like yeah the ones like the u._s. 

148.90 150.08 B: or the u._k. 

150.62 154.26 B: uh how much they would disclose under the same situation 

152.86 153.45 A: right 

169.60 171.36 A: uh but yet on the other hand you know there is 

171.44 181.91 A: you know uh the a potential uh problems there uh with um you know whatever it is that they may be doing like under the table or whatever that uh might cause a huge problem later on if it's not dealt with at some point 

196.99 199.25 A: you know it's just bad to be violent and there's a certain 

210.72 216.75 A: um so i'm not you know i i end up kind of agnostic and not really sure what the right thing is to do because of uh you know uh 

228.86 231.04 B: yeah yeah i mean the you know the threatening 

231.40 233.05 B: the threats that are being used to 

233.81 235.36 B: you know eh on one level 

235.87 236.28 B: you know you 

236.43 238.49 B: if you believe in the sincerity of 

239.61 241.15 B: of the u._s. position 

241.47 242.89 B: there's a lot of threats being used 

243.00 245.33 B: merely to get them to comply with an agreement about 

245.48 246.75 B: closing you know (( )) 

246.36 246.70 A: right 

247.34 247.90 B: uh 

248.04 250.80 B: and the threats are pretty extreme but you know it it 

251.58 254.85 B: yeah you know what i think about the idea of applying with everybody 

255.19 260.22 B: you know i'm like you know maybe that's not such a bad idea i think the u._s. wouldn't do it 

260.37 262.51 B: you know my i think a lot of countries that weren't 

262.66 263.32 B: um 

266.42 267.96 B: power you very powerful would 

268.13 268.53 B: do it 

268.85 269.23 B: uh 

269.93 272.64 B: but it would be interesting if ever- you know if there were this full 

272.86 277.04 B: boat you know efforts made a full disclosure to holding countries accountable if they were in honest 

298.13 300.68 A: so there might be an unintended uh positive consequence out of this 

300.78 307.76 B: yeah i think there was something back in the era of the league of nations where they were supposed to be able disclosure about how well everyone was armed 

308.20 308.73 A: right 

308.45 310.58 B: and do you remember that like the brian kello- 

309.78 314.32 A: just vaguely yeah i mean the kellog pact and all that yeah that's like the late teens early twenties right 

313.75 315.74 B: wha- was that suppo- was that what that was 

323.54 328.12 A: uh wilson argued for it and went on a big train tour which really ruined his health he died the following year 

327.67 329.78 B: right but that's the league of nations but the kellog 

329.34 334.97 A: oh really oh the i thought the kellog (( )) and the league of nations was all part of the same thing i'm not a big history expert so i could be wrong 

332.42 333.09 B: oh hmm 

333.75 339.46 B: yeah yeah we're bo- well we're both playing around then cause i thought there was this thing from that period you know definitely the same thing 

338.55 344.30 A: yeah i know it was the late teens early twenties there were a number of things going on because of world war one to try and say that we won't let this happen again 

344.28 344.82 B: yeah 

345.06 345.65 B: and you know 

345.76 348.79 B: i you know i don't uh it's hard to it's hard to know i think it's 

348.89 349.37 B: some 

350.33 352.29 B: there's pressure let's see the u._s. 

353.40 357.37 B: (( )) it's it's it's one of those painful things to deal with i guess hearing about it every day 

357.71 358.26 B: probably 

359.04 361.37 B: maybe reminds both of us about how uh 

362.84 364.18 B: ugly the situation is 

364.22 364.83 A: right 

364.44 369.04 B: you know and then it and it is discouraging to hear about it all the time and you know see how this 

369.20 370.55 B: battle is going on and 

371.20 372.17 B: um it looks like it 

372.29 373.83 B: it's embarrassing for the united 

373.95 374.32 B: states 

374.89 376.46 B: in a lot of ways uh on the one 

376.91 379.08 B: i think i think on the world scene because it's 

379.72 380.44 B: the u._s. ends up 

381.21 383.32 B: looking very truculent and um 

384.46 385.27 A: and you wonder about the 

384.54 389.24 B: and and right now it looks like the u._s. doesn't have any base you know although who are you know it (( )) 

385.87 386.13 A: uh-huh 

403.36 409.02 A: yeah i thought it was more like afghanistan and pakistan and saudi arabia and other places that were really funding and supporting this stuff 

409.11 413.46 B: yeah well i think some people would would think that the timing of all this is is 

414.65 415.27 B: geared 

415.91 418.12 B: just to establish the u._s. as a 

418.91 421.80 B: the youth of the force of the u._s. you know the u._s. as a force 

422.23 423.00 B: to be reckoned with 

422.94 431.11 A: and you and therefore you pick the fights that you think you can win so they started with afghanistan which was relatively easy and uh they think iraq is going to be relatively easy and they're probably right about that as well 

431.47 432.02 B: yeah but 

432.15 434.34 B: funny to think you know if if they're behind 

434.63 434.95 B: scene 

435.06 436.81 B: thinking is that the iraq 

437.50 443.08 B: is an easy target you know up up front they're saying you know what a threat ir- iraq is or could be 

443.65 444.44 B: but yeah i think it 

444.60 445.61 B: i think a lot of people 

445.99 446.44 B: you know 

446.38 456.87 A: i think there ideas is a threat is if they don't do anything about it but if they do something about it before they get like you know whatever it is that they're worried they're going to get then then uh you know uh they'll for- have foreclosed that fairly easily 

456.98 463.14 A: but once they get this stuff and they use then it's like you know it's like closing the barn door after the cow is out or whatever 

457.05 457.51 B: yeah 

464.35 465.10 B: yeah it's it's 

465.30 467.32 B: it's really is bewildering you know 

467.00 467.40 A: yeah 

467.47 469.79 B: to you know like a lot of things in the world are fair is because there 

469.89 470.21 B: i think 

470.40 472.67 B: they're very complicated and and uh 

483.98 492.94 A: general conclusions they don't tell them like the you know the details of all the intelligence they know cause they don't want to give away to the other side what what it is that they're aware of and what it is they're not aware of 

485.15 485.50 B: yeah 

492.94 496.45 B: yeah and in this case but there was one point when bush cited some information 

496.97 503.03 B: you know whenever was clamoring for some sort of evidence (( )) around back in august and then immediately you know it was shown to be 

499.10 500.06 A: right 

503.35 505.12 B: you know he he misinterpreted it 

505.51 508.28 B: he you know there was no evidence for what he was claiming in the 

508.43 510.65 B: in what he cited i don't know if you remember that 

510.51 514.13 A: no i was uh i was in europe in august and i wasn't paying that much attention 

513.42 519.60 B: yeah well he he actually cited you know he goes well there's such and such a report establishes you know weaponry or something like that 

519.34 519.63 A: mhm 

520.02 522.72 B: and then you know the i think the president (( )) saying 

523.04 527.30 B: you know in a follow up to his press people is that true and they said well actually no 

527.79 528.83 B: it's not in there 

529.17 532.31 B: and you know and then tony blair was referring to all this evidence 

533.05 534.65 B: um but they you know i 

535.01 536.13 B: there they 

536.64 537.99 B: they're really asking people to believe 

538.15 539.04 B: well they're asking their 

539.15 541.12 B: their constituencies to believe what they're saying 

541.27 541.92 A: mhm 

541.93 542.52 B: um 

543.38 544.12 B: and 

546.03 550.24 B: you know and then there i don't know and they're just coming across as very you know 

550.42 551.11 B: aggressive 

551.26 554.13 B: on the world front but you know on the other hand i don't see any reason to 

555.03 555.77 B: uh 

556.03 558.41 B: you know pretend that saddam hussein is some sort of 

559.26 559.73 B: uh 

559.93 561.05 B: you know peaceful 

561.98 563.98 B: you know dove you know he he
