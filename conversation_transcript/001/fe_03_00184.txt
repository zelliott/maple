55.77 56.13 A: (( ))

60.03 62.33 A: um i mean i'm an only child and um 

60.08 60.51 B: mm 

63.60 65.27 A: my mom is an only child

68.58 73.63 A: my dad his family was just sort of i mean he was one of three but one lives in 

74.08 76.70 A: atlanta and the other ones sort of an alcoholic 

77.17 79.17 A: he didn't really participate in things so 

79.37 80.30 A: it's mainly just 

80.97 85.61 A: you know my mom and dad and me and my grandma who lives sort of next door my mom's mom and 

86.61 90.08 A: but i mean you know small group but we still sort of manage to uh 

90.74 91.31 A: you know 

91.58 93.61 A: have kind of have a pretty big holiday 

94.07 94.47 B: right 

95.24 99.21 B: so do you do a lot of is is christmas really commercial for you in terms of 

99.54 101.12 B: shopping like do you spend a lot 

101.15 103.95 A: uh not really my parents where pretty um 

107.79 110.04 A: lower to middle middle class 

110.27 110.79 B: mm 

110.71 114.29 A: um growing up things are better now but i remember growing up 

114.98 115.61 A: um 

116.21 117.93 A: i think probably in retrospect 

118.31 119.57 A: i didn't really realize it 

120.39 121.23 A: at the time 

121.57 123.55 A: but i think that they sort of 

123.85 124.84 A: short changed 

125.01 125.97 A: themselves 

126.75 128.02 A: to give me stuff 

128.59 129.03 B: right 

129.61 130.50 A: so um 

131.62 131.97 A: but 

133.24 136.03 A: i still didn't get like things i wanted you know 

136.22 136.56 B: right 

137.04 138.47 A: like everything that i wanted 

139.06 139.55 B: mm 

139.56 144.38 A: which i didn't really have a problem with i think that's pretty good you always got to leave kids something to aspirer to 

144.65 146.03 B: that's exactly true 

146.77 151.15 B: i i think it's funny cause i'm not from the united states i just moved here 

151.27 151.69 B: um 

151.84 153.12 B: and i 

153.58 154.02 B: have 

154.28 156.63 B: i'm so overwhelmed by all this 

157.09 165.68 B: commercialism and shopping and i'm being sucked right into it that's kind of why i asked you about it it's been on my mind a lot and 

164.65 169.51 A: right i can totally see that and and as an american i 

170.31 171.45 A: i was brought up in 

171.77 173.59 A: in a nice southern family where 

174.08 174.64 A: you know 

175.77 178.99 A: patriotism is very big in the family 

178.60 178.91 B: mm 

179.27 180.38 A: um huge 

179.35 179.72 B: mm 

180.78 184.81 A: so like i'm quite the ra ra american person 

185.81 186.88 A: i'm also like 

187.22 190.69 A: horribly embarrassed by us 

191.07 193.33 A: i mean if you can be 

193.83 196.57 A: proud of like sort of the basic things like you know 

197.39 197.96 A: you know 

198.09 203.91 A: uh freedom to do what ever you want yet be horribly embarrassed by our culture 

204.39 204.77 B: right 

204.80 205.34 A: um 

208.03 212.44 B: i know i know what your saying but on the other had that's what makes it so great 

212.48 213.41 A: yeah where are you from 

212.92 213.38 B: i mean 

213.53 214.03 A: where you from 

214.41 217.05 B: i'm from canada which you wouldn't think is that different 

217.56 218.90 B: but it really is 

218.94 223.23 A: well yeah i've known several folks from canada 

223.03 223.49 B: mm 

224.53 225.96 A: uh through i work at 

226.07 226.73 A: uh a 

226.87 228.47 A: the university and 

228.64 229.19 A: um 

229.28 229.67 A: you know the 

229.81 230.76 A: there's a lot of 

231.17 232.61 A: interchange between the 

233.05 237.17 A: institutions and you end up meeting a lot of folks from canada 

237.40 237.86 A: um 

237.62 238.02 B: mm 

238.38 243.00 A: and uh i got a little taste of that actually i think it's pretty cool i often thought 

243.79 246.30 A: of going to canada myself trying to find a way to 

246.92 250.29 A: you know mcgill is a great institution you know so i figure 

249.60 250.04 B: mm 

250.67 254.56 A: try to find some way to get up there because of the uh more of the social 

255.94 257.75 A: aspects of the culture 

258.27 258.62 B: right 

261.53 262.56 A: um so 

263.29 264.83 A: what do you do in canada for 

264.99 265.38 A: for 

266.19 266.80 A: christmas 

267.54 268.35 B: um 

268.58 272.12 A: i mean what would the main difference besides the buy everything you can 

272.39 273.35 A: possibly buy 

272.93 273.46 B: yeah 

273.60 276.28 B: really i mean it's essentially the same 

276.88 286.55 B: idea you know it's a christian holiday and you know we all put up trees and have a big family dinner we have something called boxing day which you don't have here 

286.65 287.90 A: i've seen that on the calendar 

288.29 289.81 A: but i didn't know what it was 

288.31 289.18 B: yeah it it's 

290.00 293.48 B: it's actually a holiday it's the day after christmas 

294.29 300.73 B: you know it originated in britain it's the day to put away all you boxes and things like that after christmas 

297.10 297.45 A: oh it 

299.36 300.92 A: oh i see oh yeah 

301.18 302.22 A: that makes sense 

301.62 301.98 B: yeah 

302.86 306.48 B: and it's actually a pretty fun day it's usually like christmas is the 

306.78 313.64 B: is like a family day and boxing day is a friend day like you get together with all your friends and have like open houses and things like that 

311.75 312.23 A: oh 

313.72 314.43 A: that's cool 

314.75 315.24 B: mm 

315.95 317.22 A: oh wow yeah 

317.87 318.37 A: i wish 

317.89 321.83 B: and we defiantly do the same gift exchange and stuff like that but it's just that 

322.03 322.74 B: it just doesn't 

322.87 326.96 B: it's never seemed so overwhelming to me until i moved here 

328.30 328.82 A: um 

329.08 329.46 A: really 

329.84 330.30 B: mm 

330.76 331.01 A: don't 

331.60 336.18 A: i'm sorry i'm being a really naive and idiotic american um 

336.70 339.20 A: thinking that you know that the world revolves around us 

340.13 342.58 A: um don't you guys get our t._v. 

344.14 344.97 B: um 

346.80 348.52 B: yeah we do but 

349.46 354.14 B: there are laws in canada that make sure that a certain percent of the content 

354.62 362.22 B: of the commercials is canadian even if we get american stations with american programming we see canadian commercials 

357.49 357.89 A: oh 

362.65 365.59 A: oh okay all right 

363.76 364.23 B: yeah 

364.52 364.80 B: yeah 

365.78 367.06 A: well that's kind of interesting 

365.99 367.14 B: unless of course you have like this 

367.25 368.79 B: satellite or something like that 

369.01 371.57 A: you know like protect your culture that's kind of interesting 

371.02 371.98 B: exactly 

372.97 373.88 A: sort of overwhelmed 

373.99 375.04 A: (( )) we tend to do that 

375.96 377.10 A: overwhelm every body 

377.61 378.49 A: regardless of 

380.67 382.88 A: weather they want to be or not dear god 

383.90 386.33 A: we come back to me being slightly embarrassed 

384.73 385.01 B: so 

387.24 387.99 B: oh don't be 

388.82 390.71 B: i wouldn't have moved here if i didn't like it 

390.76 391.77 A: oh well yeah 

391.95 393.22 A: i guess i don't know 

394.00 394.91 A: here i am trying to 

395.04 397.16 A: think of ways to move to canada 

396.95 402.56 B: well i married an american that's why i came 

397.48 398.01 A: sort of the 

401.49 405.01 A: oh okay although i've heard it's really hard to um 

406.62 409.49 A: immigrate to canada to actually get to live there 

410.28 411.13 B: i don't know 

411.47 414.60 A: oh obviously you've never tried to do that 

413.72 416.92 B: i don't know i think if you got a job it would be easy 

416.18 416.57 A: yeah 

417.08 417.52 A: yeah 

417.34 417.98 B: thing to do 

418.41 418.81 A: right 

419.04 420.07 A: i don't know i um 

420.74 424.78 B: so when we create a holiday do you want to create a canada holiday then 

425.84 426.24 A: oh 

426.57 427.20 A: okay 

427.48 430.25 B: no i'm just joking but we have to talk about um 

427.81 428.30 A: um 

430.65 431.11 B: what we 

432.06 433.30 B: holiday we would create 

432.82 435.26 A: oh what we would create oh i don't care 

433.53 434.74 B: and how we would celebrate 

435.84 436.43 A: um 

440.53 441.25 A: well 

441.63 442.82 A: you know um 

443.62 444.43 A: it seems that 

444.61 447.17 A: that holiday are um intended 

447.26 449.52 A: to in some way um 

450.32 454.70 A: um pay homage to or commemorate something that that you feel 

455.48 459.06 A: um should persist the memory of what should persist 

459.37 459.89 B: mm 

460.37 460.89 A: um 

461.97 464.79 A: although i think most people create holidays 

464.93 467.95 A: i think holidays are created by the floral industry 

468.79 469.64 B: yeah i could 

469.39 471.12 A: because if you noticed there's a 

471.22 471.60 A: floral 

471.77 473.01 A: related holiday 

473.85 475.03 A: nearly um 

475.62 478.96 A: in all of the months where there's not another holiday like 

479.34 480.04 A: you know you got 

480.31 481.64 A: grandparents 

481.84 482.43 A: (( )) 

482.74 483.97 A: mothers day 

484.37 487.07 A: and fathers day and you know i just 

488.28 493.85 A: it seems like you know back to american commercialism um 

490.17 490.79 B: oh yeah 

493.97 495.56 A: no i don't know 

496.28 499.92 A: i guess i don't believe that strongly in anything 

500.20 500.68 B: mm 

500.24 501.25 A: that i feel that 

502.29 503.59 A: that every one would want to 

504.42 504.69 A: to 

505.61 506.79 A: participate in it 

507.23 507.60 B: right 

507.79 509.00 A: you know um 

509.39 513.00 B: what about like a civic holiday for works to just uh 

513.15 514.01 A: oh that's good 

513.47 515.28 B: have a day off or something like that 

514.40 515.17 A: oh well 

515.30 517.19 A: the u._s. sort of has something like that 

517.44 518.65 A: it's called labor day 

519.13 519.80 B: oh okay 

520.08 523.23 A: um it's the first monday in september 

523.57 524.10 B: mm 

524.20 524.94 A: and 

526.25 526.76 A: um 

527.46 527.99 A: uh 

528.10 529.82 A: it generally is 

530.46 531.07 A: um 

531.89 533.40 A: taken off by everybody 

534.92 535.28 A: um 

536.53 537.06 A: um 

538.32 540.50 A: you know all the federal stuff is closed and 

541.73 542.19 A: um 

543.19 545.03 A: um they sort of 

545.25 551.31 A: it's kind of interesting because it's take on this other meaning it was originally developed as sort of an um 

551.58 553.62 A: celebrate you know um 

553.84 554.33 A: uh 

554.65 556.98 A: the american worker and american productivity 

557.35 557.92 B: mm 

557.62 558.28 A: but 

558.41 562.93 A: now it's actually the end of the summer beach season 

564.02 566.25 A: um that's sort of 

566.36 576.58 A: you know the american work has sort of fallen by the way side and now it's all about like that's when all of the hotel rates change over to the cheaper rates 

576.65 577.55 B: right right right 

577.50 578.10 A: um 

578.68 579.94 A: and that's when you can start 

578.97 579.93 B: so you 

580.18 582.74 A: beginning to see hurricanes on the east coast 

583.08 583.51 B: right 

583.64 584.23 A: um 

584.84 587.77 A: i don't know that's sort of a course i grew up at the beach so that's sort of a 

588.69 595.21 A: that's the biggest image i have of labor day so that's the last hurrah of tourist that come down 

591.46 592.00 B: mm 

595.90 599.19 A: you know and after after labor day you life will go back to normal 

599.86 602.27 A: the lines in the grocery story will go back to normal 

602.67 603.09 A: the 

603.20 607.17 A: ah people driving the road will go back to normal you know 

607.56 609.00 B: are you from a tourist area 

608.73 611.09 A: oh yes holdom beach it's uh 

609.64 610.15 B: okay 

611.79 614.37 A: it's a little a little family beach in south eastern north carolina 

614.66 615.15 B: mm 

615.47 617.29 A: and it's really um 

618.88 621.90 A: there's not a whole lot to the there's three beaches right in a row 

622.33 623.49 A: and um 

623.83 625.27 A: there's really nothing else to do 

625.98 628.45 A: um so a lot of people 

628.57 629.22 A: come there 

629.86 630.48 A: um 

630.78 635.90 A: you know all the houses are for rent very few people actually live year round on the beach 

636.89 640.26 A: um mostly just um tourist who come in 

640.69 641.57 A: during the summer 

641.71 642.39 A: and it it's 

642.49 642.88 A: it's 

643.49 644.41 A: start telling 

645.16 645.87 A: the difference 

646.29 646.94 A: one 

647.38 656.06 A: weekend will make i mean you know you know you've got the summer which is crazy and there's cars everywhere and there's people everywhere and all the process go up and you can't get through the lines in the grocery store and then 

657.03 657.56 A: suddenly 

657.69 658.42 A: they're all gone 

659.47 662.58 A: it's amazing really

670.96 671.50 A: oh wow 

672.32 677.67 B: so a similar sort of phenomenon, happens happens and i guess that's why i never thought of labor day as 

677.94 681.99 B: workers holiday i always saw it as an end of summer holiday 

682.03 682.46 A: sure 

682.80 683.36 B: you (( ))
