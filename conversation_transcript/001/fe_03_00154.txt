0.70 1.08 B: hello 

1.70 2.65 A: hi this is tony 

2.79 4.07 B: hi my name is renee 

4.31 4.96 A: renee hi 

5.14 5.90 A: nice to talk to you 

5.25 5.67 B: nice 

6.13 8.92 B: nice to talk to you too i was going to say nice to meet you but that's not exactly 

9.62 11.65 B: right there um 

11.11 15.57 A: unless you have some one of those um what do you call picture phones or something 

15.13 17.51 B: yeah not enough money for that way 

17.09 20.79 A: well this is my second conversation on this um 

20.97 22.53 A: on this fisher study i don't know about you 

22.69 23.70 B: uh this is my third 

24.09 24.83 A: third okay 

25.02 26.24 B: yeah i've missed a couple just 

26.79 30.05 B: cause it's hard to be home i didn't realize that this was going to happen every night for the 

31.11 32.22 A: yeah i didn't realize either 

31.25 31.63 B: (( )) 

32.62 35.25 A: uh but i guess you get paid though right so 

35.40 35.73 B: yeah 

35.82 36.34 B: hey hey 

36.02 39.39 A: can't be all that bad do you have any particular views on uh 

36.84 37.43 B: (( little )) 

39.61 40.84 B: the iraq thing 

39.72 40.32 A: arms 

40.73 41.42 A: yeah 

41.56 43.55 B: i haven't been watching it that closely i 

45.58 48.21 B: i think that the u._s. should get involved just because 

50.29 50.86 B: i mean it's 

61.31 62.24 B: and it's security 

61.32 61.87 A: yes it 

62.77 66.85 A: i think so as well and that's really the stance i was going to take it it's not uh something i'm 

66.99 70.10 A: that up on but i think it's more a factor of 

70.30 75.48 A: um looking at saddam hussein and and just in general and realizing what he's capable of 

75.75 76.10 B: right 

76.13 78.51 A: it's seems as though it becomes almost like um 

79.17 80.56 A: it becomes like mandatory 

80.93 82.44 A: that had it been someone else or 

82.58 83.65 A: whatever but he's 

84.59 88.29 A: he's you know a nemesis he's someone that we always have to consider and uh 

88.56 90.42 A: i just read something interesting the other day that 

90.60 93.16 A: you have to actually give twenty four hours notice 

93.34 95.97 A: before we can actually go in and do an inspection did you hear about that 

96.49 101.52 B: i had heard that somewhere and i thought well what is the point of doing inspections then because in twenty four hours 

101.84 105.08 A: exactly we'll give you twenty four hours to get the bad stuff out of here 

105.52 107.41 A: that just doesn't make any sense to me it's um 

106.92 107.32 B: right 

108.03 112.69 A: eh those only those uh inspections are only valid i think if they're unannounced or if they're 

112.98 113.64 A: immediate 

113.72 114.03 B: right 

113.81 116.05 A: not um we'll give you twenty four hours and 

116.52 119.63 A: you know clean up this bad stuff and we'll come back it's just uh it's strange 

119.75 120.12 B: mhm 

120.25 120.96 A: strange to me 

121.93 122.84 A: you think the um 

123.03 124.97 A: war is im- im- imminent with um 

125.24 126.12 A: with iraq er 

127.00 128.72 B: hard to say i mean he's not 

129.66 131.64 B: you know years and years ago with the cold war 

132.04 132.36 A: mhm 

132.38 133.19 B: it was kind of uh 

133.96 136.15 B: it seemed like it was pretty much a standoff 

136.76 137.08 A: mhm 

136.97 138.92 B: kind of trusted each oth- even though we were kind of 

139.67 140.37 B: we we were 

140.50 142.50 B: all equally nuclear armed and what not 

142.97 143.34 A: mhm 

143.44 144.73 B: we could trust each other to kind of 

145.09 147.01 B: stay away from that unless we really got ticked off 

147.55 150.51 B: you know whereas with hussein i think he's just crazy 

147.74 148.38 A: exactly 

151.06 152.12 B: and you don't know what's going to 

151.33 151.69 A: yeah 

152.69 154.99 A: right he's like uh what did clinton call him 

155.37 156.42 A: smart crazy 

156.77 157.11 B: mhm 

156.96 160.56 A: or something like that it's kind of um i think he's totally aware of what he's doing 

161.37 163.53 A: uh so he's kind of like more of uh 

164.15 167.17 A: a sociopath type of crazy as opposed to a psychopath 

167.44 167.89 A: um 

168.16 168.67 A: like uh 

168.87 178.53 A: kaczynski he's he's i think fully aware of what he's doing i mean i know that i'm i heard of when we uh bombed him the other time that he's known to basically surround himself 

178.80 180.14 A: you know with women and children 

180.33 180.68 B: mhm 

180.33 183.47 A: just basically having them as targets so that when we do go after him 

184.19 186.32 A: he has um something to put on the air 

186.50 190.43 A: say look (( )) how bad america is look what they're doing to the women and children of iraq 

186.56 186.88 B: mhm 

190.75 191.08 B: right 

191.34 192.10 A: and uh 

192.39 196.05 A: oh yeah i mean this he's one of those people you can't put anything past them 

196.34 196.88 A: he um 

197.17 198.37 A: he's capable of anything 

199.04 199.65 B: i agree with you 

199.17 199.69 A: um 

200.57 203.04 A: and so yeah i mean i say inspect him you know 

203.17 204.08 A: with a fine toothed comb 

204.81 207.97 A: because if there's only consequences if you don't 

208.74 209.77 A: that's the way i look at it 

209.90 210.22 B: mhm 

210.61 214.09 A: you know it's only if you don't do it there's bad things that can happen if you do do it well 

214.44 218.29 A: you have to do it i mean there's i don't really think there's an option i don't know about you but 

218.99 219.54 A: what do you think 

220.31 221.16 B: yeah i just 

221.54 222.14 B: i think you're right 

222.64 223.47 B: i really do i 

224.82 227.49 B: but they need to change the way they're doing the inspections i mean 

228.38 229.86 B: they seem to be a waste of time at (( )) 

231.32 232.63 B: they're going to be giving them a notice and 

231.55 231.91 A: it's 

232.88 233.28 B: well 

233.69 234.38 B: then again i'm 

233.86 237.61 A: well i mean it seems like such a thing that they've been talking about for so long i thought that 

238.16 241.12 A: it was probably a month ago that we would have declared war 

241.38 242.70 A: it seems like every 

242.96 246.56 A: every night or every other night they're talking about these inspections but 

247.14 248.37 A: wh- wh- what is it that 

248.52 250.11 A: what is it that they do not know 

250.21 254.57 A: i mean supposedly he does have these chemical biochemical weapons and 

255.23 258.01 A: can you know basically launch an attack 

258.27 261.17 A: of that sort of uh you know biochemical sort in any country 

261.82 262.95 A: uh and so i don't know 

263.50 263.87 B: i think 

263.54 264.59 A: what is the hold up 

265.33 268.57 A: you know do they really think they're really going to go in there and not find anything 

268.69 273.33 A: and if they do it's probably just a result of the fact that they have a twenty four hour notice to get the bad stuff out of there 

274.70 275.43 A: so so 

274.76 276.09 B: i think what they're trying to 

276.67 277.05 B: do is 

278.96 279.53 B: i wonder if 

279.69 280.39 B: when 

280.49 281.80 B: you know if a logistical thing if 

282.12 282.69 B: if they 

284.05 285.24 B: when they move them 

285.46 286.94 B: are they considered disarmed 

285.65 285.99 A: mhm 

287.47 287.83 A: mhm 

287.61 290.73 B: and so therefore even though they're giving twenty four hour notice 

291.24 291.59 A: mhm 

291.83 294.22 B: during those twenty four hours when they're trying to move this stuff 

294.74 295.11 A: mhm 

295.18 296.60 B: we're not in danger you know what i mean 

296.82 297.75 A: right 

297.87 302.60 A: it it and i can't help but think too that maybe it's something that we do in in terms of rallying support 

303.01 304.42 A: that we're doing everything to a t. 

304.68 307.11 A: it's not like we're going in there like the big bad americans 

307.19 307.53 B: right 

307.81 311.62 A: and just launching attacks that we're actually following some sort of a protocol 

312.56 315.72 A: and uh i mean a friend of mine is actually from jordan she's much 

315.97 320.32 A: uh much more well versed in the topic of everything that's going on there just cause she grew up in there 

321.01 323.27 A: uh but the little that i know it just seems like we're 

323.69 326.45 A: with iraq it just seems like it's just every few years 

327.16 330.07 A: you know there's just this saddam guy that always has to be dealt with 

330.75 339.77 A: you know this is just as an aside has nothing to do with anything but why aren't the saddams of the world the ones that fall dead of a stroke they always live to like a hundred 

339.39 339.73 B: uh huh 

340.06 345.98 A: you know what i mean like who are these who are these innocent people that uh that walk down the street and die of a heart attack why isn't it someone like him 

340.95 341.43 B: uh huh 

346.17 349.19 A: had nothing to do with the disarming that's just uh 

346.18 346.55 B: right 

349.31 350.88 A: that's just a clever aside there 

351.01 352.57 A: i i don't know it's just amazing i 

352.86 355.21 A: they have to just i think inspect them as well 

355.45 359.43 A: as possible and just bear in mind that no matter what they see it's not the whole story 

359.70 360.66 B: right exactly 

360.97 361.71 A: with him i 

361.05 362.65 B: oh they've got to know that even going in 

363.40 371.96 A: oh yeah and i'm sure they do (( )) i know that he's got he's probably got an intricate as uh cave type of dwelling and system and and underground as uh as osama 

372.92 375.79 A: maybe even more so i mean he's been in power even longer hasn't he 

376.96 377.51 B: oh yeah 

377.25 377.55 A: yeah 

377.85 381.15 A: it it's even a and what's the only thing that's a bigger joke than that is uh 

381.45 382.85 A: they're election system 

383.64 384.58 B: what election system 

384.44 388.00 A: one name on the ballot 

388.28 390.40 A: that's wonderful 

391.57 392.07 A: i don't know 

392.46 392.96 B: yeah 

396.11 398.72 A: hopeful you know what they need to do is basically set up a deadline 

396.36 396.81 B: why don't we 

399.09 403.53 A: and like most often it's the case where you have these sorts of action plans that they're only really effective 

404.32 405.31 A: is if there's a deadline 

405.91 407.85 A: but we we we need to see this by them 

408.14 409.06 A: and if we don't 

409.56 410.53 A: this is what happens 

411.18 412.60 A: and that's something that i haven't heard of yet 

413.12 413.57 B: that's uh 

413.12 413.68 A: i don't know about y- 

413.86 415.77 B: wasn't there some talk of setting a deadline 

416.57 419.64 A: there there may have been if if there has been it it eluded me 

420.20 423.84 A: um they have to because otherwise then what's the point if there's no endgame 

424.02 424.68 A: what is the game 

424.99 425.28 B: yeah 

426.19 430.46 A: you know and so that's i think that they have to really consider that because what what is the next step 

430.75 435.24 A: so they go in there and they say well december thirty first if we don't if you don't comply 

435.96 438.48 A: uh it's an embargo it's or or it's 

438.67 440.43 A: it's a tax it's scud missiles 

440.88 443.26 A: you know whatever it is i mean it has to be some sort of uh 

443.94 445.68 A: a deadline or it's just words in the air 

446.32 446.78 B: right 

447.16 447.92 A: you know um 

449.31 450.02 B: well 

450.46 451.77 B: you know the other thing is though 

454.05 454.89 B: i wonder if they're 

455.05 457.19 B: thinking you know they set a deadline they're going to have to 

459.68 461.10 B: follow through that it's just not 

462.09 464.24 B: i mean he he is going to push it to the deadline 

462.14 463.03 A: yeah then otherwise 

464.86 469.31 A: sure right and if you don't follow through then the repercussions just as well because then 

470.17 471.45 A: yeah who would take it seriously 

472.46 477.51 A: you i think another interesting point too is i wonder how it's being played out in like those countries 

478.42 480.23 A: um the propaganda runs rampant 

480.44 481.63 A: in those countries 

481.83 484.86 A: you know again the big bad americans it'd be interesting to see how they 

485.65 488.59 A: play this same story um watching it overseas 

489.58 490.87 A: i wonder what it would actually look like 

490.94 492.33 B: your friend that's from jordan 

492.53 492.97 A: mhm 

493.07 494.20 B: still have ties back there then 

494.29 500.69 A: oh sure yeah her mother still lives there her mother was here for her wedding back in september first but now she's back there and 

501.40 501.97 A: ah 

502.18 506.28 A: it's tough i'm not they're not from israel and so they don't see that type of um 

506.97 509.33 A: you know travesty that seems to be going on every day 

509.76 514.06 A: uh but they they're much more accustomed to this whole idea of living in fear 

514.76 518.44 A: you know this whole idea of is it a yellow day is it an orange day is it a red day 

518.92 523.44 A: are we in danger of attack today or more so last week or 

523.67 525.41 A: it's more common place there 

526.12 528.91 A: uh that's something that we do- we weren't as familiar with until 

529.15 530.35 A: you know obviously nine eleven 

530.85 531.30 A: um 

531.94 533.14 A: and it's a scary thing isn't it 

534.30 534.90 A: i mean i don't know 

534.31 534.73 B: yeah 

535.03 535.33 B: yeah 

535.96 538.77 B: i look at that and you know we never had to live with that so it's like 

539.94 541.23 B: taking awhile to sink in 

541.79 542.21 A: yeah 

541.84 542.25 B: you know that 

543.17 545.19 B: we are in a heightened state of alert we are 

548.42 550.94 A: right and it's so i don't know i 

551.27 553.59 A: antithetical to the the way we've 

554.12 559.26 A: just always like been it just seems like you know it's not any day is not a humdrum day anymore 

559.35 559.72 B: uh huh 

559.62 559.98 A: you know 

560.11 563.06 A: it compels you i guess to really live life more to the fullest but 
563.72 566.34 A: something there always seems to be detracted from that when 

566.47 567.85 A: there's a certain element of fear 

569.03 570.15 A: that's just always there 

570.32 573.79 A: uh and maybe you know to to to try to tie that in with um 

574.34 575.37 A: uh with what's his name 

575.82 576.96 A: uh hussein it it 

577.38 577.92 A: you know by 

578.17 580.75 A: see seeing what he's doing in terms of this arms race 

581.14 582.20 A: uh than at least that 

582.36 583.98 A: can at least hinder the threat 

584.62 587.46 A: if they can you know say well if you don't meet this deadline 

587.64 589.91 A: we inflict this punishment and then hopefully it'll 

590.43 592.11 A: you know beat down his army a little bit 

592.30 592.62 B: mhm 

592.94 594.50 A: or whatever it is that he's growing over there 

595.27 595.67 A: um 

597.04 597.66 B: but from the other 

597.23 597.95 A: (( cause i think )) 

598.09 600.02 A: no matter how you slice it i think he's he's 

600.38 601.52 A: intricately woven 

601.73 603.68 A: with uh osama bin laden on some level 

604.56 605.78 B: they've got to be i mean there's 

606.83 611.19 A: the the there's there's um there's one commonality there it's their hatred of the west 

611.48 611.81 B: mhm 

612.16 615.25 A: and uh i'm sure there not huh distant cousins 

616.29 622.09 A: they are they i think probably have communications every day if mister osama 

622.26 623.41 A: is uh still alive 

623.86 624.20 B: yeah 

623.96 625.70 A: which is a whole other element 

626.11 627.97 B: i think he is though i don't think he could 

629.45 631.75 A: you know i i i i find i would find it more 

632.62 633.38 A: absurd 

633.81 634.26 A: that 

634.37 634.69 A: they 

634.91 636.72 A: they killed him off and we have no proof of it 

637.20 637.54 B: mhm 

637.89 640.01 A: i think it's much more believable given 

640.28 642.10 A: the the again the underground (( )) 

642.28 644.69 A: that's possible there and the terrain and how 

645.37 646.16 A: vast 

646.39 646.99 A: it is 

647.17 649.46 A: i think it's much more believable that just didn't get him 

650.67 651.68 A: you know unless you drop 

652.03 653.27 A: atom bombs in every 

653.61 654.65 A: every two feet 

655.26 662.09 A: the chances of you know verifying that you actually got him specifically but they mentioned one thing that i can add today that even if you got him 

662.65 665.23 A: um he they're so well connected 

665.76 668.01 A: that if osama they showed osama's head 

668.54 669.09 A: tonight
