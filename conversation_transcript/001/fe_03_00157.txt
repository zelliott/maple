6.81 10.45 A: this is uh kind of a difficult topic to talk about 

9.91 16.39 B: uh yeah that was uh exactly my thought i'm like maybe i shouldn't take this call 

15.64 21.67 A: i thought the same thing i was like uh i don't you know i'm trying to stay up on it 

22.06 22.53 B: yeah 

22.22 29.05 A: um and you know really all i get is a little bit of n._p._r. in the morning when my alarm goes off 

29.16 31.07 A: but um i guess i just get so 

31.49 33.87 A: upset every time i hear the news that 

34.69 37.23 A: i don't know it is hard for me to be objective about it 

37.27 38.91 B: well it is also i guess 

39.55 39.84 B: um 

40.14 41.27 B: it is hard to formulate 

41.74 47.90 B: a real solid opinion that is not based on emotion because you know you are not getting the whole story 

48.04 48.52 A: mhm 

49.53 52.52 A: yeah that is the other thing that is really frustrating is like 

52.66 54.99 A: there is just there is just no way we are getting 

55.46 56.63 A: objective news 

56.85 58.27 A: and objective information 

56.86 57.28 B: yeah 

63.05 65.72 A: go for it we've got ten minutes 

64.59 68.62 B: i was uh watching um deutsche welle 

68.76 69.75 B: uh german 

69.92 73.20 B: uh news show and basically 

71.30 71.68 A: mhm 

84.04 88.67 B: it was israel with any sort of arms or anything else 

89.08 91.33 B: the general public won't even know for a year later 

91.63 92.14 A: really 

92.38 100.84 B: like that was actually like the last bit of the news story is just like whether or not germany supplies armored personnel carriers to israel 

101.44 106.21 B: and i i had no idea that they were supplying them with arms since the nineteen fifties 

105.97 107.11 A: no way really 

106.77 113.62 B: yeah i had no clue this was last night i'm like oh this is whoa and 

110.66 111.38 A: wow 

113.99 114.68 B: um 

115.35 116.65 B: yeah it's just like well 

117.06 121.08 B: you know they may decide that they are going to do this is within the next few months but 

121.24 123.12 B: no words going to get out for a year 

124.08 124.81 A: wow 

124.72 127.32 B: so i'm like okay we could already be 

127.55 129.83 B: bombing things right now and it is just 

129.92 130.71 B: we have no idea 

130.97 131.49 A: yeah 

131.81 132.30 A: i think 

132.98 138.69 A: ach i get so frustrated like the news that we get out here well at least the the news on the t._v. 

138.86 142.62 A: i just get so upset because all this like new movies 

143.29 144.09 A: make the news 

143.36 143.71 B: mhm 

144.52 146.77 A: i'm like that is not news that is entertainment 

146.76 148.19 B: yeah that is not news 

147.66 151.02 A: it has no place on the news you know and they just and all the 

151.51 157.18 A: the rhetoric is is like oh you know the the fight against terrorism and i'm like 

156.57 157.12 B: mhm 

157.33 158.83 A: come on you know 

158.54 162.11 B: yeah that that's the uh the i mean i 

162.61 169.31 B: yeah it's mh- almost you know propaganda you know like making (( )) propaganda but 

165.93 166.44 A: yeah 

168.62 169.15 A: right 

169.47 170.48 B: i mean i guess 

170.91 175.53 B: i guess um i mean i guess it is really hard 

181.95 182.46 B: (( )) and 

189.60 190.11 A: mhm 

192.09 193.48 B: like i just don't know enough 

193.65 197.63 B: details i mean i'm sure there are lots of other people who um 

196.43 196.90 A: mhm 

198.34 199.34 B: who you know 

199.72 205.55 B: have the same thing it is like why aren't we just trying to reduce the cause of war well that would just sort of be ridiculous 

204.79 205.42 A: mhm 

205.82 208.87 B: and it is like how do we target one country 

209.87 210.68 B: i mean 

211.17 214.02 B: there is a source of funding of for the terrorist groups 

214.88 216.10 B: i don't know i mean 

216.22 218.00 B: i guess they are just supposing that 

218.97 220.78 B: i i don't know i mean 

220.91 226.13 B: i'm like i i i'm not getting how everything is really really connected 

227.12 232.09 B: so that is that is one of the things that i'm missing it is like money is flowing from this country to that country 

231.80 232.32 A: mhm 

232.72 233.94 B: and um 

235.00 236.25 B: you know actively 

236.65 239.70 B: as far as i know that you know um iraq isn't 

240.39 241.67 B: flexing it's muscle 

242.11 242.90 B: by 

243.48 248.77 B: accidentally having missiles go off so i mean i'm not 

246.83 247.30 A: uh-huh 

249.32 250.00 B: you know i uh 

250.42 251.78 B: i don't think it's (( saddam )) 

252.13 257.84 B: a crazy idea to like disarm a country but it is it is also one of those things 

259.69 260.54 B: where is the right 

260.87 261.70 B: to do that but 

261.96 265.47 B: you know does it does everybody have the right to bear arms and 

262.46 262.96 A: right 

266.27 270.71 B: i don't know it's it's you know you sort of boil it down it's it's kind of it's a 

270.87 272.70 B: very sticky subject 

273.14 275.18 A: yeah i feel a little bit now that it 

275.70 277.38 A: it seems to be mostly u._n. 

277.64 278.10 B: mhm 

278.27 279.90 A: stuff instead of us like 

279.69 280.27 B: yeah 

280.05 283.33 A: barking at like everybody else you know 

281.42 281.88 B: yeah 

282.19 283.79 B: yeah 

283.88 284.91 A: but um 

285.46 288.14 A: yeah that's you know it is like i certainly don't know 

288.71 290.99 A: what is going on with iraq and 

291.87 295.06 A: like you said i mean it sounds like a good idea 

295.00 295.69 B: mhm 

295.81 297.70 A: you know but 

296.41 300.83 B: yeah they are (( )) everybody so i mean it's like (( )) 

298.06 303.69 A: right exactly it is like but i think that you know like this problem is so much bigger than just 

304.03 306.84 A: right now and going in and what do they have it is like (( )) 

307.32 310.85 A: uh i mean the problem is so much bigger than that 

310.49 311.38 B: mhm mhm 

311.01 311.37 A: and it's 

311.50 314.60 A: you know and the problem has been building for decades and 

314.76 316.85 A: and to just address it on such a 

318.07 322.07 A: i don't know such s- on a small level but just this one point 

321.41 321.67 B: (( )) 

321.82 323.92 B: it's just that it is very specific 

323.90 326.35 A: it is like this isn't going to solve the problem 

326.52 328.00 B: yeah and then you think 

328.10 330.33 B: you know on a huge scale like 

330.51 337.26 B: maybe we should go to electric cars which 

332.95 333.94 A: right 

334.19 336.59 A: exactly it is like i 

336.80 344.13 A: i'm amazed that that uh you know in these last elections in the fall like the local elections and all the stuff that was going on and 

343.96 344.67 B: mhm 

344.94 348.30 A: i i just couldn't believe how many were people were not addressing 

348.92 356.83 A: the issue of like look if we really if we really don't want to be a slave to you know the oil industry then we need to develop 

357.51 365.23 A: like you said like you know electric cars and and solar power energy and blah blah blah blah and all the stuff that we've had the technology to do for 

362.55 363.08 B: (( )) 

364.94 365.80 B: absolutely 

365.68 366.70 A: decades and 

366.80 367.36 A: and 

368.44 372.34 A: you know it's like it is not about gaining control or keeping our 

372.48 378.31 A: our stake in the middle east and the oil it is about like well let's become independent from that and 

377.93 378.41 B: yeah 

379.41 382.54 A: stop screwing people over (( but )) 

391.72 392.65 B: their alternative 

394.17 397.22 B: making choices um you know people 

397.92 401.30 B: people who think i i i mean i actually know people who are like we should 

402.65 409.13 B: you know take our money and not spend it on oil in the middle east and i'm going to try to do my part and it is like well 

409.27 411.39 B: i know people in california who get the who 

411.80 412.60 B: i mean i've 

413.18 415.63 B: a friend of mine went through the subsidy 

415.81 417.46 B: with me and it was 

416.65 417.00 A: mhm 

417.58 422.55 B: an amazing deal you know it it just seemed like the guaranteed return 

419.47 419.89 A: uh-huh 

422.68 424.15 B: in five years 

424.24 424.71 A: uh-huh 

424.29 427.09 B: which is a small amount of time if you have a house if you own a house 

427.30 427.71 A: mhm 

428.20 429.70 B: and she just wasn't convinced 

430.18 430.93 A: oh 

430.96 432.45 B: so i mean i was like but 

432.87 437.35 B: but i'm like one person could do their part to 

436.95 437.93 A: yeah 

437.59 440.81 B: just stop using oil and you know it is just 

441.15 442.99 B: it sparks so many sort of other 

443.12 445.30 B: i mean i guess this this topic really sparked 

448.64 449.22 B: exactly um 

450.16 450.77 B: what is our state 

451.43 451.92 A: mhm 

451.49 453.47 B: and that we should stop being that dependent and 

453.72 454.08 B: you know 

453.86 454.22 A: right 

454.24 458.95 B: do we i guess that is what we are trying to do trying to disable 

459.44 462.47 B: uh cripple this country and but not take it over 

464.25 466.40 A: yeah sure right 

465.56 468.74 B: yeah it is like well we don't kind of want to take you over but we are going to 

468.88 469.54 B: make sure you are 

470.13 472.84 B: you know sort of the toothless tiger 

472.78 473.96 A: right and it seems like 

474.59 475.22 A: you know what is 

475.35 477.00 A: uh or at least what i've been hearing 

477.23 480.73 A: here and there you know i d- i know i don't have a really good picture of it 

481.06 481.46 B: mhm 

481.17 484.58 A: of it all and like you said i don't know if that is possible but um 

485.80 487.73 A: uh just because of the news that we get but 

487.52 487.91 B: mhm 

488.23 491.75 A: um it seems like it doesn't matter like bush seems to have his mind set 

492.30 494.09 A: on the fact that we are going to attack them 

494.15 494.76 B: mhm 

494.76 496.02 A: you know it was like 

496.19 498.62 A: in the beginning it was like oh well unless you 

499.17 501.34 A: unless you say we can go in and inspect 

501.84 502.97 A: inspect all the 

503.79 506.34 A: the site and and inspect your your country 

507.06 508.87 A: then we are going to attack you and then 

509.05 512.73 A: and then they said okay you can come in and so that is not good enough you know 

512.27 513.56 B: mhm mhm 

512.94 514.19 A: it is like okay
