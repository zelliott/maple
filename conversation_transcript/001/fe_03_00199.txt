117.07 117.95 A: uh-huh 

122.79 125.55 A: have you so you've had christmas with both of them before

125.83 127.53 A: does anything bad ever happen 

127.04 133.52 B: well [laughter] they don't they don't g- th- they're like total extremes like one's a total introvert and one's an extrovert 

128.16 129.13 A: [laughter] 

132.90 133.89 A: mhm 

133.54 139.64 B: and like the ex she's so opinionated and the other one like you cannot she won't say what she's thinking or anything 

139.75 141.49 B: so [laughter] 

140.47 143.22 A: it's kind of hard to probably try and please both of 'em 

142.89 144.77 B: yes and they're just 

143.55 145.64 A: or to make sure they're both having a good time 

145.46 153.42 B: yeah well and then it they're like extreme when they're together 'cause they don't really i mean they're just civil to each other not like buddy buddy you know 

146.09 146.95 A: yeah 

153.13 158.87 A: but have they ev- have they ever kind of ruined the holiday i mean at christmas you think everybody tries to be on their best behavior and 

155.51 157.82 B: they've never ruined it 

158.51 159.59 B: yeah 

158.96 162.23 A: you know just enjoy it and relax and have a good time 

161.82 168.17 B: yeah they've never ruined it but um they've they don't like at each other's throats not like 

168.55 182.47 B: like a all out fight but just um [laughter] it was i mean it's funny when you look back at it now [laughter] and it will be but it's just it's so extreme like my parents are normal [laughter] and it's amazing so christmas is interesting [laughter] 

170.67 171.55 A: right 

171.78 172.81 A: [laughter] 

174.29 175.19 A: yeah 

175.20 177.01 A: [laughter] 

178.44 179.51 A: yeah 

180.26 181.11 A: um 

181.59 191.17 A: my boyfriend's family like his parents are very normal and like out of all their siblings his parents' siblings they all have girls and then my boyfriend's parents have two boys 

191.56 193.15 A: and um 

193.36 198.48 A: so adam's two aunts one who is um 

198.66 202.78 A: from the fa- his father's side and one's from his mother's side have never gotten along 

202.38 203.43 B: yeah 

202.83 211.31 A: and they always kind of have this weird competition at christmas specifically about who gets the other kids' girls better presents 

211.30 224.55 A: and it was always kind of like this unspoken thing and but it became just so stressful for everybody because it was so obvious as they were opening it up you know commenting oh well so and so probably wouldn't wear something like that or whatever and one time they actually got in a fistfight 

221.38 222.97 B: [laughter] 

224.11 225.74 B: oh my gosh 

224.78 232.91 A: over who gave better presents or not and so like every christmas you know everybody kind of jokes about that but they've never had both of 'em for christmas at the same time since then [laughter] 

229.52 230.90 B: yeah 

232.37 235.59 B: yeah i can i can imagine [laughter] 

233.78 238.72 A: yeah i mean that's i mean that's the only family i've heard of ever doing that but it's just kind of amazing 

238.32 241.02 B: it's actually it's comical i mean it's 

240.05 245.47 A: yeah and i mean they're this very i mean um you know upper class family they're not like you know 

245.26 248.32 B: white trash [laughter] [laughter] 

246.04 258.83 A: exactly [laughter] and so it's even you know they're buying you know really nice gifts and they have this beautiful christmas and everything and yet these two women just can't [sigh] you know [noise] get into the spirit enough to not be punching each other [laughter] 

257.33 262.81 B: wow that's that's it's kind of funny [laughter] i mean it's sad that it has to come to that but 

259.80 261.76 A: yeah it is it is kind of funny 

262.38 264.79 A: yeah it's always a good story to tell 

263.37 264.20 B: wow 

264.56 266.12 B: (( yeah [laughter] yeah )) 

266.06 268.30 A: what do you have a least favorite holiday 

268.11 269.04 B: (( um )) 

269.18 270.78 B: not really i mean 

271.01 276.19 B: i would say valentine's day but i mean [laughter] not really it's not really that's usually what everybody says 

273.10 275.34 A: [laughter] 

275.84 276.99 A: right 

276.35 280.06 B: i guess saint patrick's day 'cause it really isn't like i'm not i- irish or anything 

279.62 282.85 A: right yeah and that's just kind of an excuse for people to go out and 

280.38 281.32 B: (( i don't know )) 

282.59 289.59 B: get drunk yeah yeah [laughter] there's nothing wrong with that [laughter] no 

283.20 285.49 A: right which i mean i've done but 

286.97 288.82 A: [laughter] right exactly 

288.85 292.86 A: yeah okay and then they say well if we could create our own holiday 

292.12 295.33 B: yeah i i don't i have to think about that 

294.63 295.96 A: yeah i know 

295.34 297.01 B: did you could you think of anything 

296.66 309.16 A: well i mean it would have to be um i'm a total this is weird i'm like a pretty big cat fanatic [sigh] so i i mean i wonder if it it i was thinking in terms like you know some sort of like spay neuter holiday [laughter] 

302.72 303.71 B: oh 

308.67 311.53 B: yeah they have something like that 

309.26 310.15 A: you know 

310.69 319.36 A: yeah i think they do have a spay neuter day and if like we if we could make it a holiday and like make cards and give people you know certificates to go get their pets spayed or neutered [laughter] 

318.64 322.45 B: that would be cute i think i heard was that your cat i heard in the background 

321.91 324.81 A: yeah i have yeah i have a couple in here right now so 

324.07 325.55 B: oh cute 

325.03 326.32 A: yeah 

325.85 327.55 B: that's a good idea 

327.07 330.42 A: yeah i mean you know i'm not very imaginative so 

327.67 328.55 B: hm 

329.75 332.62 B: no neither am i um my brain's kinda fried 

332.28 334.13 A: [laughter] 

332.68 345.66 B: [laughter] um [lipsmack] i guess that's a good idea i might do like an like an animal holiday i would agree with that one because they don't get appreciated yeah like a pet appreciation day 

334.14 334.72 A: (( mhm )) 

339.85 342.62 A: yeah i mean it seems like we have so many holidays 

345.10 346.56 A: that's a good one 

346.58 354.87 A: yeah because we have like mother's day and father's day and whatever yet you should have a we should have a pet day that'd be a good one yeah 

346.61 348.11 B: that would be a good one 

352.53 359.77 B: yeah that's a good idea i used to think that we should have a kids' day but my mom would always say every day is kids' day [laughter] 

358.08 364.92 A: [laughter] may day is kinda like kids' day i think you know 'cause you get all the candy for no reason other than it's may day 

363.66 366.10 B: yeah that's true i never thought about that 

365.24 367.69 A: you know and you get to run around and 

367.70 368.72 A: (( [lipsmack] you know )) 

368.96 370.48 A: ring people's doorbells 

370.73 376.18 A: and leave a bunch of candy and all that stuff so well do you guys do may day i m- i guess 

371.96 374.21 B: yeah yeah 

375.84 382.00 B: um i don't know um in at like in at home i did but not here 

377.41 378.29 A: (( okay oh )) 

380.72 385.15 A: okay yeah i i yeah i suddenly wondered if that was just kind of like an iowa thing or what

416.08 417.34 B: yeah 

416.96 424.57 A: you know but then you just kinda get into it and they decorate our downtown and everything and they have music playing outside and stuff so that's kinda nice 

422.65 423.79 B: yeah 

424.26 426.93 B: (( do you like so do you enjoy christmas shopping then ))

437.38 440.09 A: not stressed out 'cause you said you didn't but um

450.20 451.78 B: yes 

452.14 455.66 B: um i work at the mall so like it it gets 

453.58 455.20 A: oh my gosh 

455.74 470.52 B: it gets pretty stressful when people get mad they get all irritated they get mad that you're i mean you can only ring so fast [laughter] or if you you're out of something i mean that's the only thing that i get stressed out about but usually i do my best shopping if it's like last minute down to the line 

456.83 457.82 A: yeah 

461.77 463.26 A: right sure 

469.11 470.04 A: mhm

470.79 472.36 B: (( so i don't know )) 

471.32 476.78 A: [lipsmack] and then what do you have like after christmas when you go back to work is it just a ton of people bringing stuff back 

476.53 480.66 B: yeah returns like mad [laughter] or exchanging 

478.37 479.33 A: yeah 

479.37 482.14 A: well that kinda ruins the christmas you know 

481.42 482.59 B: yeah 

482.22 483.63 A: the feel of it 

483.30 489.99 B: yeah but and then the second that it's over it's like they take down the decorations and everything and that makes me sad 

488.15 491.35 A: right and then they start doing yeah valentine's day or whatever

492.83 493.73 B: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

493.25 500.88 A: [sigh] yeah but no i think i think a lot of people would also pick christmas as their favorite holiday i think that that would be probably pretty normal

500.54 501.58 B: yeah 

501.16 506.67 A: you know and it's one of those i mean ever since you were a kid it's just kinda one of those magical [sigh] 

506.76 508.60 B: yes all the memories 

507.28 518.04 A: things you know yeah and i can remember as a kid you know i'd actually get up and kinda look outside and see if i could see santa and his reindeer and i mean of course i don't do that any more but you still kinda get that anticipation 

512.53 513.73 B: (( yeah )) 

515.52 516.66 B: [laughter] 

517.73 520.00 B: oh yeah you get so excited
