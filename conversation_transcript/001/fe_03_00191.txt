222.18 225.01 A: interesting so it's eclectic in some ways 

225.11 228.92 B: yeah well witch craft would be part of paganism too 

229.33 229.77 A: uh 

230.16 230.80 A: interesting 

231.83 237.75 A: so uh are there do you have any kind of congregation that you meet with or is it more individual 

239.17 239.81 B: um 

240.14 240.50 B: it 

240.78 241.51 B: it depends

252.58 252.99 A: mm 

254.92 259.07 B: what halloween is supposed to be is at a certain hour the spirit the vale 

259.84 265.39 B: the line between the spirit world and the real world is very thin and the spirits can get through 

265.64 266.13 A: mm 

266.99 272.92 B: and the old story behind halloween is that everybody would dress up in scary costumes so the spirits 

273.06 273.95 B: wouldn't hurt them 

274.39 275.53 A: mm mm 

276.39 278.05 B: so we celebrate that by 

278.29 279.67 B: just having a great big 

279.77 280.54 B: costume party 

280.82 281.87 A: oh

296.60 297.50 B: yeah um 

298.32 302.27 B: i'm not exactly sure how pagans celebrate it usually i just 

302.37 303.03 B: do the whole 

303.18 303.64 B: christmas 

304.10 306.54 B: under the tree thing cause i 

306.53 307.10 A: yeah 

307.57 311.42 B: if my kids aren't here cause i have joint custody one them 

311.69 312.10 A: yeah 

312.30 312.98 B: i just 

313.13 316.76 B: not really celebrate it unless he was here because it's not that big a deal to me 

317.07 318.29 A: i see i see 

318.94 321.15 A: oh yeah i think it's harder when you have kids and 

322.23 326.26 A: there the pressures from outside start 

326.69 329.66 A: creeping in they wan what all the other kids have 

327.86 328.37 B: yeah 

329.82 334.39 B: they don't get what all the other kids have so they have to suffer 

331.97 333.47 A: yeah 

334.64 336.50 A: that's right that's right 

335.09 338.62 B: they get what they want if there luck they get what they want 

339.35 342.43 B: cause it's not easy to buy everything they want 

341.61 343.24 A: uh-huh isn't that is amazing 

342.88 346.53 B: although my kids are only one and there so for now it's kind of easy 

346.33 349.68 A: so far they don't they don't really want yet 

350.20 353.40 B: oh they want everything they don't care if they get it any more 

350.37 351.08 A: my sis- 

353.69 354.06 A: right 

353.78 355.11 B: they're happy with what they get

356.00 356.43 A: yeah 

357.26 361.75 A: my sister has a five year old and they're bringing him up jewish and they're 

362.58 365.98 A: one last year he figured out you know that 

366.24 367.87 A: there were christmas trees and 

368.51 369.72 A: and uh 

369.88 375.58 A: somebody asked him if he was jewish and he said no and they were a little perplexed and 

376.30 378.55 A: she said that all 

378.67 382.38 A: you're not jewish and she said why not and he said because we don't have a christmas tree 

382.75 387.94 A: everybody else has a christmas tree and he was getting the facts all wrong 

388.39 389.20 A: he was very 

390.07 390.95 A: he was very funny 

391.17 391.82 B: mm 

392.20 394.86 A: but the of my other favorite holidays is um 

392.28 393.69 B: that's cute though 

396.68 397.66 A: uh um 

398.32 399.47 A: valentines day 

399.53 400.28 B: yes 

400.46 401.66 B: as long as you have a partner 

402.07 402.91 A: yeah 

403.61 406.98 A: that's true although i lived with a woman who was a caterer 

408.21 410.24 A: so every valentines day she would make 

410.96 415.14 A: yeah just make cookies yeah make butter cookies and we'd frost them 

412.51 413.20 B: mm 

415.54 416.74 A: we'd put uh 

417.78 421.09 A: peoples names on them are friends or you know 

421.17 421.91 B: oh 

421.41 424.56 A: colleagues or some thing in pink and red 

424.73 427.99 A: sparkles and i think at the time i didn't have a partner 

428.20 429.97 A: so it was just a fun way to uh 

430.45 432.31 A: get into the spirit and not feel 

431.63 434.98 B: fun way to stay involved and don't feel lonely 

433.96 437.37 A: exactly exactly that's why i always like to make 

437.53 441.25 A: sugar cookies with peoples names on them cause it makes people feel good 

442.26 443.34 B: that of course is 

442.33 444.44 A: to have a cookie with you name on it 

444.22 446.89 B: when you have kids old enough they have the cards you send to school 

447.34 451.70 A: oh yeah you fill out for each kid right 

451.64 452.23 B: mm 

452.46 457.00 B: yeah they have that i'm glad they came up with that rule cause when i was in school 

457.13 457.77 A: yeah 

457.61 461.74 B: i'd only ever get one or two cards from the kids who brought for everyone because of the parents 

462.31 462.68 A: right 

463.36 468.98 A: right i remember that too how many did i get and how many did everyone else get 

468.93 472.54 B: everybody else would have at least five 

472.65 473.73 A: exactly 

473.07 477.15 B: but then i started getting happy getting that one or two 

475.88 478.92 A: yeah there's a positive out look 

480.16 484.31 B: i'm glad they made the rule if you bring something you have to bring it for everyone 

480.20 480.94 A: exactly 

484.53 486.16 B: it's not fair to the kids who 

486.31 489.40 B: nobody like it's not there fault that nobody likes them 

487.95 488.58 A: yeah 

489.79 491.77 A: right right i think it's a nice 

493.11 495.17 A: just seams everybody gets equal 

495.43 495.94 B: mm 

496.41 497.88 B: especially someone bringing chocolate

499.46 501.78 B: one kid doesn't get any chocolate 

501.94 503.36 A: that would be terrible 

504.02 504.98 A: (( right )) 

505.20 507.16 B: although i had teach who was nice for that 

507.99 508.80 A: yeah she would bring
