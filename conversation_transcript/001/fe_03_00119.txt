23.68 26.25 A: so would you like to start on this topic 

26.58 27.40 B: um 

28.17 30.60 B: i guess i i guess um 

30.71 31.59 B: my 

32.07 35.58 B: main question wouldn't be whether or not we should disarm iraq 

36.23 45.70 B: but what you m- what what you think of the u._s. u._n. being doing the weapons inspections is it going to be valuable information or 

45.80 46.83 B: is it just sort of a 

48.27 49.84 B: play in 

50.19 51.56 B: postponing war 

52.72 54.94 A: i hope it's going to be valuable inspection 

55.10 57.05 A: i can't think of any other 

57.30 57.61 A: fr- 

57.76 62.32 A: from my perspective i can't think of any other organization who could possibly do it 

62.79 63.18 B: yeah 

63.43 64.40 A: outside of 

63.77 64.40 B: i agree 

64.53 65.60 A: outside of the u._n. 

66.09 66.80 A: and 

67.85 68.79 A: i think that they'll 

69.61 70.02 A: do as 

70.84 72.09 A: good a job as 

72.56 74.05 A: iraq will allow them to do 

75.08 78.61 B: yeah and i'm beginning to think that iraq is going to let them 

80.03 81.86 A: yeah i i 

82.01 83.01 A: it's interesting i 

83.96 85.74 A: well i i haven't been following this 

86.08 88.26 A: the way i might i'm i'm and academic and 

88.36 89.60 A: this is the end of the semester 

89.71 90.87 B: right yeah 

89.92 90.65 A: so it's been kind of 

91.03 92.29 A: kind of busy 

91.75 94.49 B: understand yeah 

92.88 93.92 A: but 

94.31 94.83 A: i'm 

96.05 97.38 A: i'm hoping 

97.53 98.86 A: that this information 

99.42 99.89 A: would 

100.30 103.77 A: buy some time because i'm very concerned about the u._s. 

105.24 108.94 A: acting unilaterally making unilaterally and making 

109.24 110.38 A: moves that will 

111.47 112.45 A: be ill informed 

112.63 113.27 A: too soon 

113.37 114.80 A: and i think we need 

115.27 116.27 A: some world 

116.93 119.61 A: support for anything that we might be doing i have 

119.87 124.64 A: a lot of family in the military and they're willing to do whatever the country asks them to do but i 

125.45 128.26 A: i would like to know that there's some good decision with some real data 

128.43 132.98 B: i agree but i'm i'm not so sure that um the weapons inspections 

133.11 139.91 B: even if they come back as unsuccessful are going to do anything to change those people in the world that are that are 

140.38 142.11 B: wary of preemptive action 

142.20 143.06 A: oh i agree with you 

143.29 144.06 A: i agree with you 

143.33 143.71 B: because 

143.95 148.00 B: i just don't i mean in particular i'm i'm i study german and 

148.23 151.27 B: lived in germany quite a bit and i don't see the germans 

149.32 149.81 A: mhm 

151.40 152.03 B: ever 

152.51 154.56 B: agreeing to anything of the sort 

155.26 156.95 A: you know i don't either 

157.12 160.53 A: i don't either and i don't know that we can rely on the french 

161.16 161.63 B: yeah 

161.41 163.66 A: one way or the other because it's sort of this 

163.90 168.23 A: they haven't uh initiated or been involved in it i mean truly our our main ally 

168.56 168.87 A: is 

169.25 169.78 A: (( b._k. )) 

170.74 171.11 B: mhm 

170.90 171.48 A: and 

171.80 174.34 A: i was listening to public radio coming into work today 

174.68 175.26 A: and 

175.06 176.61 B: that is my favorite source yeah 

176.02 186.94 A: yeah i got a lot of my information there too and um they were talking about what ever this information is how much can you know our government says it has a lot of intelligence related to this 

178.37 180.05 B: (( yeah um )) 

187.37 189.93 A: (( to )) all of these situations you know (( )) 

189.75 190.12 B: right- 

190.21 192.65 A: all of these things and 

193.66 194.46 A: what 

194.58 199.99 A: what can be shared is talking about will the u._s. share this with other governments 

200.78 201.62 B: (( uh-huh )) 

200.94 204.72 A: in a in a way that is meaningful because otherwise it is sort of 

202.69 203.17 B: mhm 

204.84 205.38 A: we've got to 

205.52 207.15 A: he said she said kind of thing 

207.07 207.55 B: right 

207.72 208.31 B: right 

208.13 210.20 A: and that bothers me on both sides 

210.47 210.98 B: mhm 

210.82 211.98 A: it bothers i mean i 

212.74 213.13 A: i 

213.57 217.00 A: quote an old phrase around this place i don't trust saddam as far as i can through my 

217.27 218.69 A: building 

217.94 219.18 B: yes 

218.93 220.43 A: and yet it is kind of interesting that 

220.66 222.23 A: there he is apologizing 

222.77 225.73 A: but he is apologizing with his own apologizing to kuwait and then saying 

226.01 228.91 A: we apologize to you don't do anything the united states asks for 

229.13 229.74 B: right 

229.86 230.41 B: right 

230.24 231.33 A: (( )) it's um 

233.03 234.43 A: it's it's (( )) 

234.81 238.56 A: interesting time and there's so much information 

238.86 243.09 A: swirling about i can't even say that i don't not even entirely sure it is information 

243.73 250.38 A: because the spin meisters get in there with their opinion and sometimes you can't remember whether you heard this based on fact or it was the spin meister 

250.47 257.92 B: yeah exactly and i honestly um see uh my concern is becoming more um a belief that 

258.36 259.36 B: that um 

259.73 261.89 B: bush doesn't like to tell everything 

262.04 262.78 B: as it is 

263.61 264.28 A: oh 

263.74 264.74 B: in particular 

264.89 268.84 A: i i agree with you there i think his agenda is pretty 

269.24 270.19 A: transparent 

270.23 270.76 B: mhm 

270.85 271.49 A: and i'm 

271.61 272.30 A: i'm 

272.80 276.79 A: now with the way the um the congress and the houses 

277.57 278.68 A: skewed i mean is 

278.46 279.05 B: right 

278.86 283.61 A: is way that there is no counter balance and i'm i'm afraid it doesn't make any difference 

284.03 287.68 A: (( )) i mean the question is what should the u._s. do about iraq i'm not entirely sure that 

288.45 289.81 A: we the people 

290.48 291.44 A: have much say 

291.57 292.43 B: right yeah 

292.06 297.82 A: you know i think he has an agenda and he's pretty transparent and no matter what the information is 

298.29 298.56 A: if 

299.73 302.99 A: he has an agenda and i'm not entirely 

304.22 307.09 A: i i don't want to go to war to vindicate his father 

308.49 309.02 A: (( yeah )) 

309.27 310.32 A: i mean so 

316.84 321.07 B: without the british on their side having any sort of leeway in 

321.24 324.05 B: or leverage in getting bush to not go to war 

324.20 325.76 A: yeah and 

326.79 327.95 A: i don't know that we should be 

328.06 329.56 A: i mean for us to go war 

329.67 330.16 A: with 

330.43 331.27 A: one ally 

331.93 333.26 A: and turkey 

334.02 336.33 A: not even being willing to let us use those bases 

336.44 336.94 B: right 

336.72 345.07 A: as a staging era area i mean certainly we have long range bombers and planes that can do all these wonderful things but we are going to be all by ourselves and i 

346.29 347.61 A: not that idea of 

348.67 349.59 A: it's it's sort of 

350.00 353.06 A: flies in the face of how i perceive this my nation 

353.26 353.79 B: mhm 

353.60 357.17 A: i don't want us to and like you i lived in new york too and 

357.64 358.36 A: i don't 

358.57 359.22 A: i don't 

360.40 368.52 A: ach when i was i was living in poland and people liked us there people still like us there but i don't i think that there is there is a real arrogance 

365.01 365.38 B: (( yeah )) 

369.15 369.67 A: and 

370.00 370.76 A: we 

371.10 371.97 A: this is not 

372.09 374.79 A: this is not like a conventional war this isn't 

375.10 380.20 A: and we could we could we're talking about tons of money with very little chance we'll 

375.37 376.00 B: no 

380.33 380.63 A: um 

380.96 382.27 A: how should i say that 

383.23 386.20 A: we don't have clear objectives for when it's over 

386.52 387.02 B: yeah 

386.81 387.66 A: how will we know 

387.87 388.21 B: yeah 

388.36 393.39 B: yeah i think unfortunately the concept of conventional war is pretty much antiquated now 

393.21 393.67 A: mhm 

393.64 395.90 B: and um and people have this mis- 

396.15 399.82 B: m- misperception of what it will be like to finally go to war 

399.95 400.39 A: mhm 

400.58 409.57 B: um and and that is also troubling to me that despite um something like the gulf war where we learned that it's not conventional warfare anymore 

403.64 404.07 A: mhm 

409.66 410.12 A: mhm 

410.42 410.87 B: um 

411.16 412.27 B: it somehow didn't 

412.94 414.97 B: jerk people into the reality of it 

415.39 417.51 A: well you know what i that between 

418.74 419.80 A: the war in ninety 

420.26 420.64 B: mhm 

420.88 421.57 A: and 

421.91 425.34 A: the bosnian situation which was more like conventional 

425.35 427.07 B: yeah that's true it was (( )) 

425.86 428.00 A: you know and i was in hungary 

428.74 431.52 A: six years ago seven years ago now and 

431.99 434.26 A: my family is from right on up border 

434.79 435.83 A: right right on the 

443.77 444.22 B: (( mhm )) 

445.32 450.63 A: because because it was pretty clear i was an american i was about a foot taller than everybody and um 

451.36 452.31 A: thank you for w- 

452.59 462.10 A: what was happening for the u._n. being there for the u._s. military being there for keeping the war from coming into hungary and all these other kinds of things we were we were doing the right thing 

460.16 460.88 B: (( huh uh-huh )) 

462.16 462.51 B: yeah 

462.95 463.26 B: yeah 

463.56 465.03 A: i don't know 

465.66 467.18 A: and yet i'm so afraid 

468.66 471.58 A: what if we're what if saddam really has 

473.01 474.26 A: weapons you know i i'm 

474.37 474.77 B: yeah 

474.83 477.24 A: i i wish i had more real information 

477.47 477.83 B: yeah 

478.02 488.15 B: yeah and i think it was pretty clear um luckily for perhaps for our sakes that um the situation in bosnia and serbia was not one where um 

488.90 490.63 B: those nations could overpower 

490.85 491.54 B: o- other 

491.20 491.90 A: right 

491.75 500.90 B: european nations because they were priding on with conventional tactics more than anything and if saddam has what they says he has 

492.75 493.25 A: right 

496.19 496.64 A: right 

501.10 502.27 B: he is a threat 

502.60 503.37 A: absolutely 

503.23 505.77 B: much more so than but uh 

505.91 512.24 B: the other um thing though that i think is sort of ironic in the whole situation is that ultimately by 

512.96 522.12 B: uh if if u._n. doesn't come up with any clear indication that saddam has weapons and if it is unsuccessful i think 

519.60 520.08 A: mhm 

522.38 529.14 B: bush is really going to create a worse situation by claiming this as some need to wipe out terrorism 

528.64 529.82 A: i couldn't agree with you more
