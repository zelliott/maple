57.27 57.73 A: yeah 

60.02 60.48 B: so 

60.78 68.99 B: yes you know i have nothing to compare it to then i spent thanksgiving away and that's not that's turned out to be not such a big deal so i mean 

63.09 63.80 A: yeah 

66.81 67.35 A: yeah 

67.80 70.89 A: yeah well i think thanksgiving will have to be my second favorite 

70.99 71.51 A: so 

71.17 71.84 B: yeah 

72.12 72.65 A: yeah 

72.63 75.01 B: yeah i do enjoy i do enjoy a good thanksgiving but 

72.90 74.41 A: and again for the family reasons 

75.46 75.87 A: yeah 

75.86 82.54 B: yeah i i've honestly never thought about it see christmas my birthday is very close to christmas so for me they all kind of they all kind of blend together yeah 

79.90 81.52 A: oh yeah 

82.10 89.01 A: yeah i've always thought that would be a real pain in the neck see mine is right next to the fourth of july so until i was like six i thought the fireworks were for me 

85.73 86.31 B: yeah 

87.83 92.17 B: thought the fireworks were for you yeah certainly understandable yeah 

89.50 90.34 A: yeah 

90.48 91.83 A: that's always kind of embarrassing 

93.08 93.53 B: yeah 

93.09 94.58 A: but yeah when when is your birthday 

94.42 95.85 B: december nineteenth 

95.81 99.16 A: okay yeah so wow well happy birthday early but 

98.50 106.53 B: oh thanks yeah yeah so i guess for that reason christmas i mean i don't know christmas new years my birthday they all kind of run together in a two week run there 

99.91 100.33 A: sad 

106.84 113.36 B: in a way maybe that makes it my favorite holiday if you include my birthday i believe part part of the topic is what else do you think should be a holiday i guess i could 

107.01 107.41 A: yeah 

110.17 110.94 A: righ- right 

111.40 114.59 A: well no i think i think you you could include your birthday as a holiday yeah 

114.28 124.44 B: yeah yeah i think the romans (( )) are the winners to celebrate for two weeks straight so if we start with my birthday and then go through new years 

120.30 121.19 A: there you go 

123.53 124.73 A: it's the perfect season 

124.66 129.70 B: yeah yeah so they did ask you if you thought there should be a new holiday i i'd like to propose my birthday 

129.49 134.44 A: ah alright well yeah what holiday would you have we would have you know (( )) day 

134.55 135.94 B: yeah yeah 

135.20 139.26 A: oh international (( )) holiday world peace for a day 

139.69 141.62 A: (( )) we would all send you presents 

142.67 143.79 B: that 

143.19 146.83 A: yeah i don't know i was i was thinking about like what holiday would i want 

147.61 149.49 A: you know that that doesn't currently exist 

148.74 149.36 B: yeah 

150.93 154.15 A: i don't know i mean i like the thought of 

155.01 159.30 A: i mean i love martin luther king junior day but i think it's so sporadic and it's so 

160.10 165.53 A: weird across the country like here i am in pennsylvania which is very interesting because i'm from the south 

165.57 166.22 B: mhm 

165.75 167.77 A: so when i came to pennsylvania i just 

167.91 169.48 A: assumed that people had 

169.97 171.88 A: martin luther king junior's birthday off 

172.65 173.72 B: do you not in pennsylvania 

172.75 173.40 A: but i guess it 

174.06 175.63 A: not at penn state 

176.20 176.84 B: wow 

190.11 190.55 A: but 

192.59 195.99 B: still after i've got something to find classes classes start at the tuesday after m._l._k. day 

196.31 196.73 A: right 

196.52 199.29 B: and i had to i find some semesters so it was never an issue 

196.95 197.29 A: right 

199.04 203.06 A: well even if we went back before we always had the day off like we had along weekend or whatever 

203.23 203.95 B: yeah okay 

203.35 207.60 A: so it was really strange you know my husband worked for the banking industry and they had it off and 

207.84 211.82 B: oh yeah well banks take any day off so it's 

208.06 208.99 A: when i worked 

209.96 215.45 A: well that's true that's true but i mean ah when i worked at a big accounting firm i worked at one of the big five firms and they didn- they didn't take it off 

215.78 216.27 A: i was like 

219.44 219.97 A: yeah 

222.40 228.35 A: no no no deloitte and touche like the most american you know big five accounting firm they didn't have it off either so 

227.96 229.54 B: yeah that's funny because (( )) 

228.96 238.35 A: probably be- there are you know there are virtually like no people of color working there like the only other person was like the copy guy so like he and i were like we're not working on the doctor's birthday you know 

234.84 235.81 B: yeah 

247.28 247.72 A: right 

248.03 248.44 A: right 

248.61 249.01 A: right 

249.58 252.47 A: but i mean i think that there should be like sort of a more general like 

253.02 254.32 A: civil rights holiday 

254.56 257.49 A: because i think a lot of people are uncomfortable with the fact that we're celebrating 

257.64 261.13 A: specifically martin luther king junior which i have no problem with i think he's great 

260.97 261.79 B: yeah yeah 

261.40 270.01 A: you know like i you know like i think it's a lot i think it's a big excuse for a lot of people who don't want to celebrate they're like oh he was a philanderer or he was this or he was that i'm like you know what huh guess what 

269.42 271.88 B: those are pretty flimsy excuses 

270.29 274.45 A: we celebrate washington's birthday too and he had slaves you know like come on 

272.13 274.91 B: yeah exactly 

275.13 277.50 A: but it's just it's funny because i i i think that 

275.21 275.84 B: yeah 

277.77 280.86 A: and i i obviously it's because people get on their high horses because they don't want to celebrate 

281.13 283.22 A: what he stood for it's not that they don't you know they 

283.34 286.77 A: give a crap one way or the other about what he did in the bedroom it's just that they don't want to celebrate 

286.92 287.72 B: yeah yeah 

287.29 290.94 A: that but so i feel like if we had a civil rights holiday then they wouldn't be able to say 

291.48 295.99 A: well we shouldn't celebrate that day without looking like a total racist which is what they are so 

295.99 296.42 B: yup 

296.20 296.49 A: and that's 

296.88 297.60 A: some of my feelings 

297.34 300.51 B: yeah i would define (( )) definitely would make it make it more clear 

300.86 302.21 A: yeah yeah 

302.60 304.84 A: but other than that i have no idea like 

305.87 311.09 A: what holiday i mean like half the holidays i don't even know what they are for like i'm sure labor day 

311.60 313.38 A: i used to know what it was like what 

313.83 316.83 A: we don't work it's not about working 

323.21 323.51 A: right 

325.98 326.58 A: ah yeah 

326.73 327.13 A: yeah 

334.37 338.27 A: (( )) with it i want to say i heard this -cause of course i teach international students so they always want to know what the 

338.36 346.53 A: what the origin of the holidays is and i never know and i feel like such a tool -cause i'm like yeah i'm an american and i'm teaching about american culture and i have no idea why we celebrate labor day but how (( )) you know 

339.63 340.21 B: yeah 

347.18 355.33 A: um but i think the reason what i heard was that the unions wanted some holiday that would break up the the span of time between thanksgiving 

355.81 356.85 A: and fourth of july 

357.77 364.27 A: but i could be wrong about that like there was this huge expanse of time where there was no holiday and so they wanted something that would give people a long weekend 

360.23 360.68 B: ugh 

365.01 366.13 A: but that could be complete 

366.28 367.21 A: urban legend 

367.70 368.43 A: no idea 

374.09 381.77 B: played up then as a thing to get people to go out and you know to to stimulate the economy more but really it was kind of a regional new england thing mainly massachusetts thing before then 

374.27 374.73 A: huh 

381.47 382.19 A: really 

382.11 382.71 B: yeah 

382.45 384.85 A: inter- well i've always thought we should have thanksgiving 

383.11 385.17 B: i just heard that i don't know huh 

384.97 387.31 A: i've always felt that we should have thanksgiving when the canadians have it 

387.86 391.78 A: is it much better to have it like in you know late october because then you know you've got 

391.89 394.61 A: like another six weeks or another actually more like 

394.95 396.52 A: two months to you know get sick of 

396.69 400.73 A: you know to no- not be sick of turkey and have leftovers forever and that kind of thing an- 

398.79 399.48 B: yeah 

399.95 400.56 B: yeah 

400.91 405.75 A: you kind of stress throughout the whole holiday season a little bit more but having thanksgiving so close to christmas is always 

406.54 408.49 A: i mean i'm the eternal college student so 

408.75 412.16 A: you know it's always like ugh thanksgiving means exams you know 

411.55 417.25 B: exactly they (( )) signifies the other the time of year you worked the hardest 

414.86 415.40 A: right 

416.59 418.42 A: so it's just i don't know um i 

417.95 418.78 B: yeah 

418.58 421.38 A: that's why i'm not grateful to still be a student after all these years but 

421.58 422.20 A: good grief 

427.86 428.41 A: yeah 

433.58 434.01 A: yeah 

434.07 445.98 B: like i said i think the romans had two weeks you know and other other like i don't know like luther like i work with (( )) i know lutherans and stuff so they get their advent calendars you know which marks the month leading up to christmas and stuff so they get they all consider the whole month before christmas to be you know kind of a season 

434.23 434.68 A: yeah 

441.12 441.97 A: oh yeah yeah 

442.79 443.45 A: oh yeah yeah 

448.59 453.97 A: yeah will then it's great to be like in an international office because then you have people celebrating ramadan you got other people celebrating 

453.58 454.35 B: yeah 

454.16 455.86 A: chanukah and you know this whole 

456.31 456.92 A: thing and it's 

457.21 461.17 A: you know that's kind of exciting because i think now at least i'm learning more about these holidays but 

461.57 465.47 A: you know when i was a kid i just thought okay there's christmas and like a couple of my friends celebrate chanukah 

465.65 466.12 B: yeah 

465.95 470.38 A: but i'm not sure whether it's accepted you get presents for eight days which completely rocks when you're in first grade because 

469.80 473.17 B: yeah right yeah 

470.90 479.35 A: you know who wouldn't want christmas for eight days but i had no idea why chanukah was celebrated i just knew like there was a menorah there was a dreidel and there were lots of presents 

479.51 480.27 B: yup yup 

479.73 480.94 A: like that's all i really knew 

481.67 483.54 A: but you know so i think it's kind of interesting that 

483.78 484.28 A: at least 

484.93 485.53 A: sort of 

485.66 489.21 A: since maybe the late eighties people have started to develop more awareness about 

489.38 490.36 A: other you know 

490.57 494.45 A: other peoples' holidays because not everybody celebrates christmas and i think it's it's really 

495.11 496.50 A: i don't know it's i i 

495.70 496.31 B: yeah definitely 

496.62 497.89 A: i just think that that 

498.13 499.84 A: you know i know tons of people who are like 

499.97 500.44 A: i don't 

502.18 510.74 A: i'm just not interested in christmas you know i'm doing the whole (( )) thing this year or i i switched holidays this year this year i'm going to do you know ramadan at night well great but 

505.22 507.20 B: yeah yeah 

511.53 512.24 A: you know 

516.83 527.51 B: and ah they all say they're all like we don't want to w- we hate to ah break it to you guys but chanukah really is not that big of a jewish holiday it just kind of like feeds off of christmas people want it to be big but it's not you know 

517.02 518.35 A: yeah it was so early this year 

522.65 523.58 A: right exactly 

532.31 535.84 A: the jewish equivalent of christmas well no actually it's not 

534.83 539.79 B: yeah yeah no the jews are (( )) roshashanna and that was the the most the biggest jewish holiday i guess yeah 

538.23 538.99 A: exactly 

539.47 545.15 A: yeah yeah yeah and so like you know their holy season is passed because it was really like end of december 

545.51 545.94 A: you know with 

546.15 547.28 A: yom kippur and 

547.50 551.12 B: yeah they have like a whole week basically right of the high holy days yeah yeah 

547.86 549.31 A: the roshashanna and all that kind of stuff 

549.99 550.46 A: yeah 

550.70 551.19 A: yeah 

551.71 552.16 A: so 

552.31 557.48 B: yeah i wonder when they if they started if they always have exchanged gifts around chanukah i mean not only christians started exchanging gifts on christmas 

552.70 553.23 A: i don't know it's 

557.96 560.10 B: but i wonder if then if that rubbed off on the chanukah 

560.55 564.94 A: yeah i don't know you know i'm i'm sure that they all go back to pagan festivals actually because i know that like 

560.86 562.27 B: in europe or something i have no idea 

564.08 565.02 B: oh yeah yeah 

565.21 568.13 A: you know i know easter is derived from a pagan festival i'm sure christmas
