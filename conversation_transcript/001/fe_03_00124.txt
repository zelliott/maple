22.66 31.23 B: i ah i i heard a couple of of things they left on my answering machine while i was out so i knew what the topic was except that i i 

27.81 28.68 A: mhm

35.98 37.38 B: and ah 

37.95 52.31 B: ah i thought it was just about invading iraq and i'm not even sure what the purpose of the invasion is but i i have just been totally astonished that there hasn't been more of a 

49.90 50.81 A: (( [noise] )) 

52.88 55.12 B: general objection to this 

55.72 59.16 B: it's like you know what what right do we have 

59.40 60.89 A: yeah it seems 

61.02 63.10 A: [mn] i don't know about the

66.96 68.15 A: well um 

68.25 71.13 A: [mn] i don't know about where you are but where we are there is 

71.50 74.72 A: anti war demonstrations but they're very small 

73.31 75.48 B: oh you must be in the north east 

74.90 78.68 A: (( yes yes [laughter] how did you guess that )) 

77.03 78.07 B: (( [laughter] i kn- )) 

78.50 80.33 B: i know how this world works 

78.70 84.93 A: [laughter] [laughter] and where are you located [laughter] okay [laughter] 

81.90 88.93 B: i'm in the mid west i mean there is there's a small a small active um 

85.64 86.74 A: yeah very 

89.11 94.32 B: community but mostly you know nobody's just nobody's making any noise at all 

93.73 100.57 A: mhm are there [sigh] a lot of um people in the armed forces where you are 

100.56 105.52 B: [mn] no no it's a college town as a matter of fact but um 

103.29 104.35 A: mhm 

107.31 108.81 B: [lipsmack] it's just 

110.61 116.76 B: you know it just a- th- because i'm old enough to remember the vietnam war in the sixties 

115.26 116.29 A: mhm 

117.35 119.03 B: and i- 

119.24 121.34 B: i'm astonished at the difference 

121.25 124.50 A: yeah well that's what i'm saying even though there is um 

124.32 127.37 B: (( because we've got our eyes open now [laughter] )) 

126.81 138.52 A: even though there's protest i can't believe that there's not more [mn] protest here um and that could very well be because we have one of the larger contingents [sigh] that are 

130.34 131.75 B: (( mhm )) 

138.61 151.99 A: overseas the tenth mountain division is um [noise] ah about probably about fifty miles from here they're based out of and um they have a lot of troops over there [cough] and i personally know quite a few um people 

144.62 145.77 B: mhm 

151.74 152.84 B: mhm 

151.92 156.44 A: that are stationed overseas between iraq and afghanistan right now 

156.11 157.10 B: oh 

157.06 160.92 A: but um [sigh] as far as [mn] 

161.09 165.66 A: the reaction yes i- i'm with you in that i'm surprised that more people aren't 

165.78 171.43 A: vocal against it because that that was one of my immediate thoughts and you already said that is 

172.10 176.45 A: why are we [laughter] why are we there um 

176.91 182.97 A: what what do we have to do with it um [lipsmack] and i don't feel i don't feel right to give 

183.30 190.87 A: [noise] a a full voiced opinion like we shouldn't be over there we shouldn't be doing anything because i don't think i'm i'm knowledgeable enough about the entire situation 

190.36 194.28 B: yeah i guess i guess what i think is that if 

194.34 195.39 B: um 

195.67 197.35 B: (( the inspectors )) 

197.83 200.03 B: and the report 

200.12 202.35 B: gives any reason to believe 

202.34 204.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

202.56 210.50 B: that you know anything is going on the way the way bush has been saying then the united nations should do something and yeah we should 

210.95 212.10 B: support it 

211.77 213.47 A: mhm s- yeah 

212.40 224.94 B: but the united states acting alone this is the part that i just don't get i just don't get you know how [laughter] i mean tha- that that puts you in the class of an aggressor as far as i'm concerned and i 

216.93 218.05 A: mhm 

224.73 231.07 B: i have never course i'd i'm i'm not old enough to remember the spanish american war i really don't know 

229.37 230.21 A: mhm 

231.06 242.34 B: what that that one might have been an imperialist war a full fledged imperialist war but in my lifetime [laughter] um you know i- it's just totally foreign to me 

242.22 243.09 A: yeah 

243.21 247.55 A: well i an- [sigh] it's scary and i and i 

247.99 248.93 A: feel 

249.20 250.20 A: um 

250.43 260.37 A: no- not just bad i feel poor in the fact that i haven't educated myself more about the situation but i do know that it it does not seem 

260.56 269.79 A: like something a peace- a peacekeeping nation would do is actually you know [noise] instigate some sort of [sigh] military action 

269.78 279.97 A: in a country that is at the moment not directly no- now i say this [laughter] not directly threatening us with anything 

278.83 279.84 B: right 

280.48 282.34 A: so [sigh] 

281.72 287.10 B: you know i did i didn't congress debate this a couple of months ago 

286.80 292.23 A: [noise] mhm and i i recall that bush was saying well it doesn't matter what you're doing because [laughter] 

292.29 296.08 A: (( i'm going to do what i want i mean that's putting it in layman's terms but )) 

294.35 300.37 B: well i think he knew i think he knew he had the votes which he did but they had a long debate because i i 

296.89 297.46 A: (( [cough] )) 

297.71 298.55 A: mhm 

300.34 300.91 A: (( [noise] )) 

300.39 308.71 B: would hear it in my car when i was driving around and the people who were speaking against it were saying all 

302.39 303.63 A: mhm 

309.08 322.17 B: you know the right things that you know everybody should be considering and all of this and [mn] i guess i i think maybe the difference is september eleventh that that just 

316.85 318.88 A: [noise] [noise] 

321.56 323.54 A: oh i'm sure no you're 

322.79 328.88 B: although i don't think there's any any direct i don't know of any direct connection between 

323.59 326.20 A: i'm sure you're right [laughter] 

329.47 332.82 B: saddam hussein and september eleventh but 

331.54 335.31 A: mhm yeah but it's it's not 

333.48 336.33 B: and you'd think if there was one they'd have told us about it 

336.04 343.79 A: [sigh] and even if there is a connection i don't think that the connection is being made at least in 

343.90 350.56 A: american minds the connection is being made between saddam hussein and september eleventh in a physical form it's the 

350.70 365.19 A: philosophical form of terrorism and that's connection enough for most people in other words in other words we experienced a a terrible terrible [sigh] event as a nation that was a result of terrorist activity and so 

353.13 354.18 B: yeah 

354.93 356.08 B: i guess [noise] 

365.02 371.63 A: [noise] we're not going to anymore you know stand for anybody who's who's posed a threat to the u._s. 

371.20 372.25 B: right 

371.80 373.72 A: so [noise] but sorry 

373.37 376.09 B: oh somebody just got up from their nap 

375.73 384.36 A: no somebody's [noise] just [laughter] got up from a fall on the floor [noise] [noise] yeah but um 

379.49 380.73 B: oh 

380.94 382.38 B: well that's worse 

384.96 390.44 A: (( let's see if i can [laughter] distract him [laughter] )) 

391.59 392.59 A: okay 

393.47 404.24 A: so um but no i think that it's just the overall idea of what happened on september eleventh that has given people maybe people that would have spoken out before 

404.57 409.48 A: people that might have said something people that were on the fence are now going to 

409.49 414.50 A: no- either not say anything or support military action because 

414.78 417.07 A: you know september eleventh was so 

417.46 418.74 A: drastic 

417.47 421.68 B: yeah i i you know personally i just get the feeling that 

418.82 420.70 A: (( yup )) 

422.01 423.24 B: um 

423.04 425.63 A: (( yeah )) 

425.36 436.70 B: go- that that people that would speak out th- they they run a risk of you know social ostracism and vilification if they do it in the wrong circles 

436.38 437.37 A: (( [noise] )) 

437.24 439.30 B: i mean much more than 

440.02 441.58 B: than i remember 

441.93 445.21 B: it being i mean [lipsmack] of course i was a lot younger then 

444.86 445.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

445.46 452.01 B: ah during the vietnam war but yeah you spoke out and people that you didn't give a damn about 

452.09 452.97 B: (( thought )) 

453.23 454.87 B: you were terrible 

455.02 455.98 A: yup 

455.69 457.70 B: but um i 

458.55 463.28 B: was it last year was it just a year ago i guess it was um 

463.63 468.07 B: you know everybody put put ah american flags up 

467.48 468.48 A: yup 

468.33 476.70 B: and there was a woman in this town who went around telling the shopkeepers that if they had their flags up that she wasn't going to shop there because 

476.72 480.38 B: you know the flag waving made her uncomfortable 

480.22 480.93 A: (( huh )) 

480.85 486.58 B: and they wrote to the newspaper you know letters to the editor it's a big thing in a small town 

486.70 487.58 A: yeah 

487.36 489.53 B: they wrote letters to the editor 

489.85 490.66 B: (( ah )) 

490.92 494.80 B: describing this activity and and giving her name 

494.83 502.73 B: and for weeks people wrote letters about what a terrible person she was and she should go to afghanistan if she didn't like it here and 

502.90 504.62 B: uh jeeze 

503.83 504.74 A: wow 

505.21 517.71 B: and i understood her sentiment you know i i personally complained to the grocery store you know after a week i said you know could we go back to you know elvis presley and the beatles as some muzak 

507.02 507.91 A: mhm 

517.66 523.12 B: i've had enough of patriotic music it's beginning to get on my nerves 

520.96 521.81 A: yeah 

523.63 524.79 A: yeah 

524.24 527.48 B: i want to think about something else when i go to the grocery store 

529.38 530.90 A: [noise] yeah well ah 

531.33 536.35 A: it- definitely there was a [laughter] huge outpouring of brand new fresh you know 

536.99 542.56 A: americanism and patriotism and everything that could be red white and blue 

542.66 551.17 A: and again that you know leads into the how terrible september eleventh was and the same reason that people now are 

551.83 555.79 A: even if it's passively supporting aggression they are 

556.03 556.90 A: (( you know )) 

557.59 559.49 B: i guess i guess 

559.42 564.29 A: [mn] i think i think [laughter] i think being quiet about it is 

565.35 568.63 A: [sigh] is a is a way of supporting it for some people you 

568.12 572.77 B: [mn] yeah i think people have to feel like they have some power and that must be 

573.19 574.05 B: (( you know )) 

574.69 576.40 B: okay support the 

576.53 582.59 B: support any action against any terrorism and i have a little bit more power then i'm not so helpless 

576.80 578.14 A: (( know )) 

578.16 579.57 A: [noise] 

582.02 586.09 A: yeah yup yeah and september eleventh 

586.27 588.21 A: made people feel helpless 

587.92 590.24 B: oh yeah no doubt about that 

588.37 590.23 A: and and that you know 

590.75 594.44 A: and so it it's [noise] reactions against that so 

594.48 597.02 A: (( but [sigh] )) 

597.92 599.72 A: other- but [laughter] 

599.74 601.27 A: but for me to say 

601.96 605.58 A: we shouldn't be over there doing anything we should have nothing to do with it 

606.67 609.08 A: i'm not quite at that point now 

608.10 611.93 B: no no i think i mean it's i think it's the united nations 

612.42 619.61 B: and i don't i don't have any reason at this point to think that anything's rigged with that either way 

617.58 618.66 A: mhm 

619.54 625.40 B: you know if they find that there's a problem then yeah i a multinational force should 

625.26 634.73 B: should go in and solve the problem but i- if that means [laughter] you know you can't go taking out the heads of state in other countries 

625.41 626.27 A: [noise] 

634.66 640.83 B: this is just you know this is against international law [laughter] you can't do that 

638.03 639.18 A: yeah 

641.55 646.89 A: well um [sigh] the only thing i can say to that though is that [noise] 

647.58 649.43 A: i've done enough study 

649.73 651.69 A: to hear the 

651.91 658.68 A: the overall ineffectiveness of the united nations and the lack of power and the lack of [sigh] 

658.92 662.25 A: the lack of unity as far as 

662.57 669.22 A: any governing that they do that that to say you know let the united nations take care of it 

669.67 673.24 A: doesn't hold a lot of water [laughter] and 

673.10 682.21 B: well yeah there've there've been problems that's true that's true but i don't know isn't isn't isn't aren't things working out in yugoslavia 

676.72 677.82 A: and now 

682.49 683.59 B: slowly 

683.64 688.62 A: [laughter] yeah slowly yeah yeah i mean i like i was saying i do- [lipsmack] 

689.10 694.33 A: i know th- they have power but i also know there's a lot of question of how how effective they are 

694.39 700.10 A: and so the only thing i could think of going back to what you say what you said about having the u._s. 

700.12 701.05 A: um 

701.28 707.11 A: support [noise] in any way the united nations and what they're doing maybe 

707.37 716.97 A: the u._s. could become a more supportive or find out a way to be more supportive more a vocal factor in the united nations so that [sigh] we are doing 

717.09 719.89 A: our part to make the united nations strong and the fact that
