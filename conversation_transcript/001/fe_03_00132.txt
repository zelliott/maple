47.94 51.63 A: sometimes i i'm not sure whether or not i disagree that the prete- that that necessarily a bad thing 

52.61 53.30 A: um 

54.09 60.72 A: so i'm kind of conflicted in in two two different aspects of it one whether or not we should be inspecting two 

60.82 65.49 A: whether or not even (( )) even if we should then even if it's just a pretext whether or not that that's justified 

66.00 66.55 B: mhm 

66.70 68.80 B: yeah i i i 

69.01 70.93 B: well this going to this will be easy and (( perhaps )) 

71.11 73.94 B: and not as exciting as they hope um 

74.15 83.74 B: i feel similarly although what i tend to be confused about these days is why iraq and it's very interesting these days that we're so 

83.83 87.33 B: gung ho about being anti iraq and painting (( )) such 

86.28 88.25 A: it sure came out of nowhere yeah 

87.95 94.11 B: yeah and and suddenly it's oh you know back to the you know just thinking back to the whole axis of evil like suddenly oh 

93.86 96.87 A: yeah yeah that was unexpected yeah 

94.47 95.60 B: okay you 

104.22 107.84 B: it seemed just in terms of at least a financial back of terrorists 

107.74 108.25 A: yes 

108.83 112.56 B: it's interesting how we don't do anything about that 

113.32 116.42 B: you know saddam is evil and iraq is evil and 

118.49 120.23 B: go saudi arabia 

126.17 127.07 A: if uh 

145.89 146.59 A: then 

147.13 155.00 A: i- putting a sort of occupation i mean fifty sixty years ago we were bitter enemies with germany and japan and now we're allies and so if they're planning if it's a long term planning thing to sort of 

152.50 153.01 B: yeah 

155.13 156.74 A: put in a pretext knock down a government 

164.48 172.50 A: they couldn't do it in saudi arabia they couldn't do it egypt afghanistan maybe doesn't have enough to offer and isn't isn't in fact an arab country so 

172.80 178.61 A: you know that leaves iraq because iraq no one i think in the middle east you know saudi arabia egypt iran none of them 

178.77 187.42 A: are fond of iraq but i think the last person they want to see go in there is the u._s. to fix the situation (( )) if there is a situation and if 

183.19 184.19 B: yeah 

188.95 197.26 B: well see that's the trick too is it's like so should we be ousting saddam from power what and you know the other key the thing that 

197.92 206.55 B: frightens me even more is so what if we're successful so what if we get rid of saddam what are we going to do next we're not doing a very brilliant job in afghanistan 

205.87 206.93 A: no not at all 

207.51 208.63 B: and so 

223.92 228.93 A: oh i they uh i think people see maybe as more valuable you know as occupying iraq and then setting up a pro american government there 

229.29 233.07 A: is actually more of a priority for the u._s. than it would than it would have been in afghanistan 

233.45 234.02 B: mhm 

235.81 236.82 B: (( )) 

249.67 250.42 A: go in and do that 

251.51 252.87 B: yeah i don't it's uh 

253.19 255.32 B: what i would i tend to worry about 

255.77 258.44 B: um more and more these days too is 

258.58 260.81 B: eh anti americanism 

261.02 265.43 B: backlashes which is which are tending to become stronger 

266.06 270.34 B: i mean in the middle eats definitely but even in a lot of other parts of the world um 

266.51 267.20 A: yeah 

274.70 275.12 A: mhm 

280.53 283.53 B: western europe western europe which in a lot of ways is 

283.69 288.52 B: uh you know which most people just link up right with the u._s. okay uh you know this western culture 

288.11 289.22 A: yeah yeah 

288.88 294.96 B: um but you you definitely i'm starting i notice that there are more and more people who are 

295.87 299.47 B: basically sick of the united states and are willing to 

299.64 303.14 B: if something goes wrong that vaguely resembles 

303.59 306.04 B: things that happen in the united states the u._s. gets blamed 

306.51 307.33 A: yeah 

307.59 308.54 B: so at s- 

308.84 311.62 B: i mean that's the other thing that we really need to 

311.95 313.88 B: think about it's 

314.21 318.17 B: if we choose to expand for moral reasons to expand our global reach 

318.88 321.63 B: people aren't always going to be happy about this i mean uh 

326.32 335.75 A: to justify it morally i mean it unless you sort of appeal to maybe the the imposition of democracy or women's rights but no i think it's more of a 

335.05 339.30 B: although again we're again we're very happy with the situation in saudi arabia where women can't drive 

337.46 343.20 A: yeah exactly yeah ignoring that yeah 

341.15 343.47 B: that's hunky dory that's fine 

343.30 344.68 A: yeah 

344.17 345.05 B: whatever 

364.65 365.96 B: even think about it 

377.23 378.64 B: yeah 

377.81 383.57 A: you know and not and not and neither of them expand anywhere and y- y- you know within the region it's i think it's also i mean i think it's a bit 

383.80 390.47 A: it's a bit of a fallacy to assume i guess all through all through out the middle east and through all arab speaking nations that they all are sort of one mind about regional politics but um 

403.99 404.60 A: um 

405.19 406.30 A: but i forgot where i was going with this 

407.12 413.24 A: you know you get exci- you get i don't know you get bogged down in the pragmatics of the situation and forget why it's happening um 

413.39 416.96 A: oh but the moral question just whether or not it's right to im- impose american will i mean 

417.40 420.28 A: i guess it depends on sort of your definition of morals i mean whether it was right for 

420.78 422.80 A: the romans to expand as much as they did or 

422.98 424.24 A: anyone like that you know 

425.13 428.30 B: yeah they'll make the problem of course is when uh the the 

428.49 436.12 B: you know throughout history the expansion always always uh you know followed eventually by contraction and that's again huh 

436.31 440.59 B: you know roman empire british empire this doesn't work within the long run 

439.84 441.81 A: yeah yeah 

442.26 443.95 B: and sometimes i mean the eh 

444.29 445.65 B: see things can 

446.08 448.49 B: fall apart and if things work out okay 

448.73 449.27 B: i think 

449.73 451.22 B: we're fine in the u._s. 

451.50 452.53 B: even though you know 

453.13 456.78 B: britain we forced britain to pull out but clearly if you look at other countries 

457.97 460.78 B: when they've been colonized and then they've kicked people out you know 

461.03 465.24 B: it it's can be really it can be impossible to recover from that sometimes or it's 

465.45 469.19 B: i don't know it's a very painful messy period and either countries 

468.30 470.15 A: oh absolutely yeah 

469.62 474.29 B: these are countries with full of painful messy periods and it's just like i 

475.73 476.38 B: i don't know 

476.57 477.89 A: no that's certainly true yeah 

490.05 491.96 A: any ethical consideration can be brushed aside 

492.78 499.00 B: or we create our own ethical consideration you know we cast things in the appropriate light so it looks like it's ethical and moral 

498.98 510.28 A: yeah exactly i mean you can always bring in some sort of like i suppose like nietzchean perspective to it where it's just more i mean morals have been morals have evolved they haven't been static throughout all of human history and so really the i mean the consonance is the the is the will and so 

499.13 499.68 B: oh 

510.93 516.96 A: and that's that's that's where it is i mean and that's all values is i mean it's literally amoral thinking thinking without morals but 

519.01 521.64 A: yeah but that's a debate i don't know that i haven't that's the part that i haven't 

522.03 523.02 A: considered myself 

523.77 526.93 B: yeah well that's something that it's 

527.36 531.20 B: it's that whole juxtaposition wherein on the one hand like i i can 

531.60 533.52 B: think back how long ago uh you know 

533.67 539.97 B: pre september eleventh i remember getting periodically getting emails about the plight of afghanistan's women 

540.44 543.98 B: and in under the taliban and i remember that and i (( )) 

541.80 542.63 A: yeah the 

552.18 559.42 A: yeah but then i think at the same time and it's the same situation the last anybody wanted to see move in there and take over do something about it was america 

558.59 561.31 B: yeah and of course the thing is is that you know
