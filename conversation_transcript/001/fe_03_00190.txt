7.57 9.08 B: so holidays 

8.82 9.47 A: okay 

9.75 10.34 A: um 

10.76 13.50 A: well i guess the question was what's your favorite holiday 

13.58 13.96 B: yeah 

14.84 15.42 A: what is yours 

14.93 15.32 B: um 

16.90 19.51 B: i'm i'm not really sure i have one actually like 

20.34 24.65 B: i know that most people like the the really festive ones but um 

25.77 27.00 B: the one that i really kind of 

27.42 33.94 B: get the most out of i think is i'm jewish and one of the holidays is yom kippur where you're supposed to kind of like reflect on your life and all that 

34.14 34.51 A: right 

34.44 35.46 B: and i just 

35.84 37.10 B: i i really like that one 

37.26 45.98 B: just because it makes me like it's the one day that i can like sit down and think about absolutely everything that's been going on in my life and kind of like plan for the future and stuff like that 

46.12 46.56 B: it's just 

46.84 49.01 B: i just really think it's rare to kind of find that time 

49.64 54.13 B: so i i really like that one but not in like happy festive sort of way 

53.54 53.95 A: right 

58.26 58.59 B: right 

60.25 62.38 A: you're life and where it's going and that kind of th- 

60.69 60.99 B: yeah 

62.53 67.99 A: that's sounds really nice actually sounds very reflective i'm i'm actually catholic so um 

66.77 67.22 B: uh-huh 

68.17 71.15 A: i don't really feel a lot of our holidays are you know very 

71.82 72.36 A: i think they're 

73.05 74.18 A: they should be this and 

74.33 80.02 A: intended that you know we reflect on um what's going on in our lives and all that but i don't think 

80.86 84.61 A: people actually do that particularly in um around christmas time i think a lot of people 

84.73 85.84 A: spend time um 

87.28 95.17 A: doing meaningless things like shopping they don't they don't bring a whole lot of meaning to the holiday itself and it's kind of defeats the purpose 

95.41 95.83 B: yeah 

95.81 97.39 A: that's why i think one of my um 

97.66 100.13 A: favorite holidays is actually thanksgiving because 

99.98 100.45 B: oh 

101.21 102.86 A: a time where people can just 

103.13 107.52 A: sit down and give thanks there's not a whole lot of pressure of going out and buying gifts and 

108.00 109.47 A: it's not very commercialized 

109.70 110.04 B: right 

110.67 111.04 A: so 

110.68 117.57 B: so that's interesting that we both kind of like the ones where you get to you know think about things and and reflect a little bit yeah 

115.69 116.01 A: yeah 

117.60 118.20 A: that's right 

118.99 122.83 B: too because yeah yeah you're right like a lot of the other ones are very commercial and there's 

122.12 122.50 A: right 

122.96 124.03 B: there's pressure to 

123.10 127.33 A: even some of the ones that shouldn't be like for example valentines day that's 

127.45 132.96 A: just supposed to be a day where you can show people anyone in your life that you appreciate and love 

127.66 127.98 B: yeah 

133.19 135.68 A: just show them appreciation that's it but it does 

135.89 145.11 A: it turned into something commercialized where you know if it's not candy that you buy then it's expensive jewelry or and there's the pressure to send cards and 

137.77 138.12 B: yeah 

144.23 148.43 B: yeah yeah well actually it's funny i'm not sure if this is true but i remember hearing 

148.56 149.90 B: from somewhere that um 

150.33 153.15 B: mother's day and father's day was actually created by the card companies 

153.72 155.12 B: (( )) hallmark or something 

154.91 155.49 A: really 

155.52 159.26 B: i i'm not sure if that's true but i i either heard that or read that somewhere 

159.61 160.60 A: i wouldn't doubt it 

159.96 160.31 B: yeah 

160.90 162.95 B: because i mean where do those holidays come from 

163.41 165.20 A: yeah i mean i wouldn't doubt that because they 

165.32 170.17 A: think the card companies probably started other holidays like i mean things that peop- 

169.69 170.65 B: secretaries day 

170.59 172.42 A: yeah secretaries day and 

171.19 171.58 B: yeah 

172.22 179.69 B: i mean not that you shouldn't have a day where you think about all the people in your life and everything that's fine but it's just i mean they didn't do it for that reason they did it because 

179.94 181.83 B: you know let's get the public to buy more cards and 

182.01 182.41 A: right 

182.05 183.26 B: send (( )) presents 

183.08 184.33 A: exactly and people comp- 

185.18 186.45 A: into that i think 

186.25 186.64 B: yeah 

186.89 187.52 B: definitely 

188.07 194.76 A: so okay the other question was if you could create a holiday which one um i'll pose the question to you 

195.29 196.76 B: oh god um 

197.96 200.28 B: uh if i could create a holiday let's 

200.42 200.76 B: see 

201.28 202.30 B: well i think 

203.18 204.26 B: given what we both 

204.71 205.13 B: said 

205.31 206.83 B: about the reflective holidays 

207.24 212.92 B: it seems like maybe l- maybe some universal reflective holiday like not religious 

214.25 214.96 B: not 

215.22 217.02 B: you know specific to any kind of 

217.13 217.70 B: group 

217.73 218.19 A: mhm 

217.86 218.46 B: but just 

218.73 219.12 B: um 

220.77 225.66 B: sort of a day of reflection where we kind of think about the people in our lives and think about our own lives and 

226.45 226.81 B: um 

228.12 234.38 B: something maybe that would make people connect also like maybe the tradition of that holiday could be 

234.93 235.79 B: you know you 

236.04 245.02 B: (( )) now we're getting back to the cards yeah you send cards to like your ten favorite people or something but then the card companies are just going to turn it into something more commercial so you know 

240.51 240.89 A: yeah 

243.47 244.37 A: right 

245.11 246.81 B: send presents too 

246.54 248.69 A: yeah i'm sure that would be involved 

248.61 249.05 B: yeah 

249.39 251.57 B: maybe maybe the rules of 

251.73 255.80 B: the tradition of the holiday should be you know you can't spend money that day 

256.34 256.79 A: right 

256.80 258.75 B: no cards no presents you just 

259.02 260.01 B: write letters 

260.15 264.14 A: i was going to say the same oh maybe write let- i wasn't going to say that but that's a good idea 

264.44 266.99 B: that would be cool actually get back to letter writing 

268.11 268.46 A: hm 

268.66 269.06 B: yeah 

269.56 271.72 B: a letter writing holiday that's what i would do 

271.68 275.56 A: could you do email would email be acceptable 

272.52 273.69 B: you spend a day 

275.34 275.94 B: no 

276.37 278.04 B: i don't know it's not the same 

278.20 278.96 A: yeah that's true 

278.93 280.80 B: you know it's just it's too brief 

281.36 283.06 A: yeah it's it's a little more impersonal too 

282.83 283.30 B: yeah 

283.44 283.77 A: yeah 

284.05 284.51 A: that's true 

285.09 285.43 B: yeah 

285.59 288.29 B: so that that would be my holiday a letter writing holiday 

287.91 288.24 A: hm 

289.18 291.05 A: i think maybe i would pick a day where 

291.42 291.94 A: you would just 

292.06 294.19 A: choose certain people you call them up and 

294.90 297.03 A: choose certain people in your life you know maybe it's 

297.68 300.75 A: spouse or boyfriend girlfriend whatever um 

301.16 302.75 A: and friends whoever you want just 

303.08 306.56 A: call people on the phone and invite them over to your house and 

306.71 307.45 A: the only thing they're 

307.60 310.09 A: allowed to bring is something to eat or drink that's it 

310.37 311.43 B: that's a great idea 

311.29 313.09 A: and it has to be something that they made 

313.56 313.95 B: uh-huh 

314.12 317.42 A: so you know a lot even though thought went into and um 

318.38 324.30 A: you know i mean i guess that might make it stressful because then people feel obligated to cook but it could be done at a time where 

324.88 330.51 A: i don't know especially maybe on the weekend where people have more free time or something they cook a meal of their own something that's 

328.85 329.20 B: right 

330.70 331.74 A: -nificant for them 

332.43 338.75 A: and bring and just all gather and no one's allowed to bring gifts no one's allowed to bring cards no one's allowed to bring anything that 

338.96 339.73 A: had to do with 

339.97 342.92 A: a lot of money going into it except for the little meal that you bring 

343.43 343.99 A: just kind of 

344.11 344.96 A: sit around with candles 

345.37 346.68 B: that's there's a nice idea 

346.58 347.42 A: i think that would be nice 

347.63 350.27 A: i don't know what i would call it but 

347.64 348.16 B: yeah 

349.46 350.20 B: yeah 

351.37 351.88 B: well 

352.26 353.40 B: dinner day 

353.15 353.66 A: yeah 

353.66 356.35 B: keep it simple that's a really nice idea 

353.77 354.15 A: (( )) 

354.58 355.30 A: could be that 

356.68 358.08 B: i think it's interesting how we're both 

358.19 359.74 B: sort of thinking along the lines of 

360.03 365.44 B: you know just reflection and people in our lives and you know it's just it's so not what most of the holidays are about 

362.58 362.93 A: right 

365.37 366.15 A: that's true 

366.54 370.19 A: and that's what they should be about and i was just actually having this conversation with 

370.54 374.40 A: similar conversation with my sister yesterday and saying that um 

374.73 382.12 A: you're get all you receive all these christmas cards i do anyway in the mail and sometimes i receive them from people that i see on christmas day 

382.76 387.21 A: and i really like christmas and it has a special meaning for me too because it's my birthday actually 

386.84 387.61 B: oh 

387.81 389.02 A: yeah so um 

388.37 388.88 B: wow 

390.05 397.30 A: but people end up sending people i see on christmas day and and i told my sister i refuse to send people cards who i'm planning on seeing 

397.43 401.52 A: christmas day because i think the point of the card is to send someone a greeting 

401.71 402.23 B: yeah 

401.73 404.93 A: you know letting them know you're going to think of them on that day or 

405.09 412.12 A: you know they can't be around on that day and you just want to wish them a marry christmas and happy holidays but for someone you're going to see on that particular day what's the point 

409.56 410.01 B: yeah 

412.14 414.01 B: you know it's so funny that you say that because 

414.18 414.90 B: i get 

415.12 420.75 B: so almost offended when i get christmas cards in the mail from from people that are really close 

420.85 422.23 B: to me and that i see regularly 

422.94 427.45 B: and they just kind of say you know happy holidays hope you have a great day or something like that you know 

427.25 427.62 A: mhm 

427.80 428.53 B: but it's 

428.64 429.45 B: so 

429.56 436.03 B: it's it's it's a holiday card and they're all the same they're all kind of you know but for someone who is a close friend of mine 

432.37 432.69 A: yeah 

436.12 438.86 B: i i understand why they think it's a nice gesture but 

439.01 439.29 A: mhm 

439.64 441.78 B: very strange to me i kind of i i 

442.10 443.59 B: do get offended in a way 

443.52 446.88 A: i can i don't blame you because they're really not thinking of what 

447.13 450.77 A: that season even means to you but then again i mean you could be 

448.99 449.41 B: right 

451.29 454.61 A: i can understand a little the holiday cards they're a little more 

455.58 460.14 A: you know they're not as descriptive in saying merry christmas or whatever they just say something very general 

458.78 459.15 B: yeah 

460.26 460.59 B: yeah 

460.61 461.08 A: and 

461.76 464.18 A: for you because i'm you probably celebrate hannukah 

464.13 464.73 B: yeah i do 

465.02 465.48 A: so 

465.90 469.45 A: i think it would be appropriate for them to send a card prior to hannukah 

469.36 469.72 B: right 

469.90 472.96 A: that would be nice but if they're sending it after hannukah's over then 

469.91 470.87 B: it never happens 

472.64 473.28 B: never happens 

473.63 473.97 B: yeah 

473.66 474.35 A: really 

474.24 474.67 B: yeah 

474.80 475.73 B: it's very rare 

476.22 476.69 A: huh 

485.38 489.36 B: but as the years go on they kind of like lapsed a little bit and this year hannukah was 

490.74 491.28 B: (( )) 

491.41 491.77 B: started 

492.19 493.09 B: it was really early 

493.54 496.16 B: and not a single person wished me a happy hannukah 

496.13 497.09 A: seriously 

496.26 500.33 B: it's kind of like if it's not right around the same time as christmas they kind of forget so 

500.63 501.10 B: yeah 

501.56 506.60 A: oh see that's so sad i do have a jewish friend actually and i mean i 

501.68 502.41 B: (( )) 

506.83 508.57 A: i especially think of her 

508.97 511.37 A: around that time and i mean i can't imagine just
