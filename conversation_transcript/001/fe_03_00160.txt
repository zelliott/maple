222.36 222.79 B: um 

223.27 227.01 B: eh eh eh against iraq but also against american forces

237.49 237.90 B: yeah 

240.65 241.78 B: mhm 

241.58 249.86 A: so like ah turkey doesn't want to be involved in it because it already has a lot of political problems and economical problems 

249.73 250.39 B: yes 

256.45 258.73 A: saddam hussein is going to do is to bomb 

258.89 260.07 A: turkey you know because 

260.41 262.87 A: um america has lots of bases in turkey 

262.58 263.25 B: yeah 

272.98 275.54 A: sa- saddam hussein down without the war 

275.80 276.53 B: mhm 

282.95 283.54 B: yeah 

283.26 291.44 A: and stuff like that but the thing is um what i see it's it's a matter of fuel stuff 

292.15 293.55 A: so like um 

293.81 298.69 A: i mean america is acting political realist is to go there and 

298.93 305.64 A: you know have a kind of you know authority on the fuel re- reserves of iraq 

302.49 303.28 B: yes 

305.26 306.13 B: mhm 

305.93 307.88 A: and like um 

308.31 313.68 A: i don't know maybe the guy really has you know very fatal weapons in his hands 

314.32 320.63 A: but as i said before like there can be other solutions to get him down he is really like a poison 

321.27 324.42 A: he really needs to be you know stopped some ways 

324.52 327.93 B: so you you feel that is that the 

328.03 330.99 B: the way most people in your country feel 

331.17 334.22 A: i mean the people in my country don't want 

332.21 332.87 B: is it 

333.31 334.66 B: he's very dangerous 

334.85 335.54 A: i know 

335.08 335.69 B: man 

335.80 338.52 A: i know i know but like ah 

339.40 340.25 A: i mean like 

345.13 346.35 B: mhm 

353.03 353.97 B: mhm 

353.86 360.71 A: like i know that america in so influenced and the strongest country to get influence with you know countries 

361.10 362.71 A: um inside politics 

362.83 363.27 B: yes 

363.62 364.64 A: i mean like 

364.91 370.80 A: they could do something before but the want they waited for the devil to get so big and now it's like 

371.08 371.63 A: terrible 

371.95 372.40 B: yes 

372.81 374.98 B: yes and he's become too powerful 

372.91 373.67 A: and 

375.37 378.03 B: and the other thing that happened is because uh 

375.41 375.76 A: yeah 

378.32 382.05 B: my feeling is that the sanctions that we have 

382.17 382.44 B: put 

383.19 383.64 B: against 

383.79 385.21 B: iraq has caused 

385.35 386.62 B: the iraqi people 

386.75 387.22 A: uh huh 

387.36 389.79 B: to be even stronger in support 

389.95 392.05 B: because they are being punished 

390.00 390.45 A: mhm 

392.38 393.43 A: yeah yeah 

393.22 395.37 B: it is so strongly i mean it it 

394.21 394.53 A: [noise] 

395.55 396.36 B: terrible to 

396.45 396.87 B: see 

397.21 400.88 B: these pictures of children who are being deprived of medicine 

401.08 401.65 A: mhm 

401.09 402.83 B: and simple things that 

404.03 405.71 B: that there is really no reason 

404.73 405.00 A: [noise] 

405.89 406.34 A: mhm 

405.90 406.15 B: that 

406.28 411.68 B: they should not be able to have access to so the embargoes have been and the sanctions 

411.78 412.28 A: mhm 

412.20 412.82 B: i think has 

413.11 413.86 B: could just been lift- 

413.95 414.28 B: ed 

414.46 414.95 A: mhm 

415.16 415.78 B: and 

416.21 419.66 B: if they have lifted the sanctions and have negotiated 

420.32 423.04 B: earlier perhaps they could have negotiated 

423.21 425.04 B: eh and had a more civilized 

426.33 426.86 B: eh eh 

426.96 427.39 A: right 

427.02 429.50 B: solution rather than 

428.19 428.61 A: yeah 

430.06 431.98 B: but america tends to go in 

432.54 435.85 B: we have this history of going in full force and 

436.43 438.19 B: and blowing things up and it 

438.79 439.20 A: yeah 

439.19 439.61 B: so 

439.94 440.33 B: eh ah 

440.76 441.60 B: i it 

441.72 444.37 B: it's my politics i get very ups- 

444.48 446.64 B: upset that they do that i'm more of a peace 

447.23 447.75 A: mhm 

447.62 449.59 B: peaceful person i think that there is 

450.14 451.32 B: that worlds are always 

451.45 451.90 B: better 

452.10 452.85 B: than bombs 

452.13 452.59 A: mhm 

453.85 454.78 B: but i 

455.02 457.78 B: you know i think turkey is in such a dangerous 

458.58 459.87 A: yeah very dangerous 

459.48 460.66 B: location and 

460.61 460.87 A: yeah 

461.35 463.49 B: it it and you get it from all sides 

463.60 464.56 A: mhm mhm 

464.99 467.52 B: that you would be affected by anything that would happen 

467.55 468.01 A: mhm 

468.43 468.84 B: so it 

468.53 469.05 A: and 

469.09 469.79 B: very dangerous 

469.17 469.50 A: yeah 

470.30 474.18 A: and there is another stuff i don't know if you know about the kurdish 

474.29 475.80 A: problem we have in the east 

475.35 475.84 B: yeah 

476.43 479.62 A: and like ah you know the kurdish terrorist is 

479.76 491.57 A: now caught and he is captured and in prison but like um um when america you know invades iraq and changes the type of government 

491.56 492.35 B: mhm 

492.27 497.94 A: these kurdish people are going to stand up and say we want our piece of land in iraq 

497.84 498.16 B: yes 

498.08 502.34 A: so like um they will have a kind of you know like um 

503.07 503.64 A: country 

503.93 504.37 B: yeah 

504.04 512.91 A: within iraq so like it be border neighbor to turkey too and it's going to catalyze the problems between you know 

513.41 516.60 A: kurdish and turkish government 

516.79 518.04 B: oh definitely 

517.94 525.68 A: yeah because like all european countries like use kurdish people to create problems within turkey 

525.38 526.33 B: mhm 

531.80 532.39 A: we always 

531.98 532.90 B: mhm 

532.53 544.38 A: say that say that you know like we don't want deal with that and we don't have problems with kurdish they are very successful they have lots of money and like 

543.20 544.20 B: mhm 

547.92 550.70 A: (( )) it's like a a chain 

550.92 553.49 A: so it's going to affect us in so many ways 

553.67 558.01 B: oh yeah but that's not the vision that we see of the kurdish people 

554.70 555.21 A: right 

558.40 558.95 A: mhm 

558.77 563.40 B: ah eh ed what we see in in our press is that they are very
