57.32 59.66 B: yeah i've i don't really feel that informed about it either 

60.13 61.77 A: it seems one sided to me 

62.92 69.49 B: no i mean i definitely have the opinion that if anything is done it should be done uh unil- unilaterally it should be done through the u._n. because 

69.38 69.97 A: yes 

69.63 73.00 B: u._n. is a recognized international authority and the u._s. technically is 

76.07 76.56 B: that's the 

77.19 77.69 B: that's the 

77.24 81.09 A: and yeah and why we never honor the power that they have i don't understand that either 

80.88 83.05 B: yeah well i mean basically the united states doesn't 

83.16 83.68 B: have to 

84.30 85.18 B: big powerful country 

85.73 86.33 A: right 

99.06 100.31 A: yes rather than 

100.43 103.49 A: rather than sin- uh singly which makes us look 

104.20 105.02 A: even worse 

105.17 108.14 B: yeah i mean no- not only does it make us look worse it makes the 

108.28 108.68 B: process 

108.80 110.36 B: somewhat unaccountable it makes it a 

111.64 113.41 B: a war an an aggressive act 

112.64 113.25 A: yes 

113.64 114.04 A: yes 

113.86 115.24 B: um that's not being monitored 

115.56 115.95 B: by 

116.95 117.61 B: by the authority 

119.04 121.21 A: and i guess i don't understand why now after 

121.41 123.84 A: after everything last year is is this coming 

124.18 124.43 A: i 

124.97 125.65 A: it's like going to 

125.97 127.91 A: is last year an excuse for this 

128.13 128.62 A: for this 

129.27 130.07 B: do you think so 

130.18 131.16 A: i don't know 

131.30 132.00 B: it seems to me 

131.58 132.35 A: do you 

132.31 133.12 B: it seems to me that 

133.93 134.99 B: it's pretty clear 

135.46 136.32 B: it's maybe something that 

136.91 137.94 B: the bush administration 

138.36 140.75 B: wanted to have on its agenda when it came in but then 

140.87 141.95 A: oh interesting 

141.85 144.31 B: but then the change of the mood of the country 

144.47 147.38 B: um after the terrorist attacks last year um 

148.36 150.85 B: made something possible that maybe the rest (( )) country 

151.09 152.57 B: wouldn't have been ready for before the 

152.96 154.66 B: people weren't ready at that time to send 

155.47 157.15 A: it would've been a different atmosphere 

157.14 158.60 B: yeah i think so people would've not been 

159.02 160.19 A: how interesting 

161.15 162.33 B: ready for war or or 

162.57 167.79 B: sort of chomping at the bit to go kill someone to go have some revenge on someone even if it's not the attacker 

163.67 164.18 A: right 

164.64 165.06 A: right 

167.41 170.75 A: the mind set would've been different we wouldn't have been thinking in that direction 

168.86 169.26 B: probably 

170.75 171.95 B: probably would've been more sort of 

173.13 174.79 A: i don't know it's a scary 

175.48 179.68 A: it's a scary part of the world that that i don't understand and i wish i did more 

180.23 180.64 A: um 

181.47 182.73 A: e- you know that i would've 

183.31 189.63 A: i that i would read more and understand it more i have a son whose really into it and i should pay attention more to what he says 

188.35 191.09 B: is he sort of is he just a person who's interested or is he some sort of 

190.57 193.17 A: just very interested yeah ver- 

191.74 193.48 B: ah he's not a journalist or uh 

193.62 194.86 B: political scientist you could say 

193.77 196.52 A: no no just a college student who enjoys 

197.15 199.74 A: watching b._b._c. and all that yeah 

200.14 202.80 A: but i don't have a i don't really 

204.35 207.13 A: i guess my opinion would be that i don't have enough 

207.96 208.45 A: of a 

208.57 211.34 A: a background in it and that i um 

213.30 215.62 A: i'm not sure that we're on the right course 

216.41 217.66 A: i don't know whether that would 

218.10 219.83 A: that sounds right doesn't it yeah 

219.99 221.62 B: yeah it seems like we're sort of agreeing 

222.14 231.81 A: very interesting so yea- we're kind of like what they used to call what the doves instead of the hawks yeah right i'm aging myself now see that 

227.64 228.76 B: yes exactly dove 

231.24 231.76 B: i'm sorry 

231.93 235.39 A: i said i'm aging myself see that 

234.49 236.80 B: oh by saying that they used to be calling it doves instead of (( )) 

237.00 238.59 A: no no no those phrases 

239.92 240.71 A: from from 

240.30 240.64 B: the phr- 

240.74 242.71 B: the phrase doves and hawks oh because it 

241.70 242.39 A: yes 

243.15 244.10 B: associated with vietnam 

244.01 245.49 A: yes yeah 

244.25 244.54 B: yeah 

245.00 247.73 B: i've heard it in other contexts i've heard it in the con- i've heard it in the context of 

247.95 249.43 B: present day israel for instance (( )) 

250.25 251.10 A: oh yes 

252.40 254.02 A: and that election is coming up too 

254.82 257.34 A: i wonder how that's going to work out with all that's going on 

258.24 259.03 A: i don't know either 

259.55 263.51 A: well i'm not i really not going to stay on too long is that okay did we discuss enough 

263.24 267.48 B: well i think actually eh i think we might need to stay on the full ten minutes to make sure we get paid 

267.20 268.35 A: are you serious 

268.33 268.74 B: uh 

268.87 273.36 B: i mean it's only like i think ten or maybe twelve minutes that it goes for but have you have you not done this before 

273.30 273.81 A: no 

274.01 276.42 B: yeah i did a couple i'm not totally sure but i would think that 

276.89 277.94 B: they wouldn't want you to just 

278.10 281.40 B: give your i think they would want you to do the whole time since yo- we are getting paid 

282.58 287.66 A: i hadn't thought of that i should've probably um maybe had it more so that it would be at home rather than at work 

287.45 288.51 B: oh did you have oh you just 

288.19 288.90 A: yeah 

288.84 290.70 B: you're worried that someone's going to walk by and (( )) 

290.49 291.82 A: yeah 

291.43 291.89 B: uh 

292.94 295.61 B: yeah it would maybe maybe could we finish this call up and 

296.46 296.75 A: yeah 

297.62 302.75 A: i don't know but but i guess if they if you're supposed to i didn't start timing did you did you 

302.72 306.62 B: no i didn't i i think we've only i i think we do have a little bit more time to cover yeah 

306.35 307.36 A: yes i bet we do 

306.80 307.12 B: i def- 

307.37 309.54 B: i i i would like to finish it just so i can get my money 

309.98 310.70 A: okay 

310.38 311.52 B: okay (( )) 

311.24 311.86 A: go head 

312.07 313.03 B: uh so um 

313.65 315.31 B: it seems that we haven't 

315.74 318.77 B: we don't have a whole lot much more to say about the iraq situation now do we 

318.66 319.28 A: right 

319.24 321.08 B: you were talking about the press coverage before 

322.53 323.09 B: i know 

323.31 323.65 B: that 

324.32 327.08 B: like you said we get a pretty one sided picture probably here in the u._s. 

328.90 329.93 B: my girlfriend in particular read 

333.13 335.94 B: and i don't in the case of germany she reads the german presses especially 

336.12 340.46 A: right and i know someone that does that too and go head i want to hear what your slant is on that 

340.42 342.09 B: oh well just generally that there's the 

342.32 343.41 B: the you know um 

343.81 348.89 B: schroeder right is his name the the chancellor who did very well for himself by opposing 

345.40 345.76 A: right 

349.19 349.49 B: um 

349.70 350.80 B: u._s. military action 

351.15 351.77 B: um and 

351.18 352.09 A: right 

352.39 354.91 B: it helped his popularity in germany so it's clear that um 

355.19 356.40 B: in that country at least the 

357.06 358.39 B: uh the mood is definitely again 

359.38 360.07 B: unilateral 

361.11 363.51 A: and aren't they protesting or something too 

364.72 367.70 A: i don't know but or or bad feelings i guess 

367.68 368.16 B: yeah 

368.84 372.91 A: that that the way th- there there stance is the opposite right 

373.22 377.39 B: yeah i think in gen- i think the majority opinion in fact probably in most european countries uh 

377.54 378.27 B: with a population 

379.74 383.54 B: at least against u._s. unilateral action i don't know about against u._n. action 

383.97 384.49 A: right 

386.42 393.81 A: that's and i think that's probably how they the rest ma- maybe the other european countries feel the same i don't know though isn- isn't england still with us 

393.92 397.90 B: i believe that england is but i don't know what the majority opinion of the population is in en- 

395.20 395.59 A: yeah 

398.23 400.25 B: i i i think i read somewhere that it's also sort of 

399.12 399.68 A: yes 

401.40 402.62 B: much less uh committed 

403.11 403.52 A: huh 

404.18 405.16 A: be interesting to just 

405.35 409.69 A: be over there and be a little fly on the wall and see what they think don't you think 

407.28 407.68 B: uh-huh 

409.20 410.06 B: yeah i mean i i 

410.21 415.19 B: you'd think actually if you dug around on the internet you could probably find some polling information from those countries 

415.67 417.40 A: but i'd like to talk to people 

417.30 417.68 B: yeah 

417.51 419.77 A: in general wouldn't you rather than just 

420.15 420.49 B: yeah 

420.84 424.15 A: cue from the news or whatever how do they feel you know 

424.82 430.90 A: but i guess being on a college campus you could do that too because there's so many international students that have opinions about how things are 

429.64 430.51 B: that's definitely true 

431.42 434.48 A: i eh i don't know what your experience is but but 

433.58 434.84 B: yeah i'm on a college campus i 

435.29 435.63 A: right 

436.21 437.36 A: and and that they would 

437.66 438.26 A: um 

439.14 440.85 A: maybe weigh in differently than what 

441.01 442.77 A: than what america would think 

443.52 447.49 B: i have one professor in my (( )) department who's very very vocal on the issue and has a big 

449.22 449.89 B: war uh 

450.21 450.99 A: really 

450.81 451.43 B: statement on his 

451.65 452.32 A: really 

451.72 452.90 B: door and on his web page 

453.81 455.48 A: really 

455.30 457.25 B: so he's someone who's not afraid to make a big 

457.69 458.78 B: some other people are probably 

459.59 461.96 B: biting there tongues more if they're here in the u._s. 

462.43 463.00 A: huh 

462.83 465.45 B: i mean it depends on where you come from too whether you feel comfortable 

466.63 467.27 B: political opinion 

468.57 469.09 A: yes 

469.41 469.86 A: huh 

470.21 473.74 A: i i but he's he's he's definitely the other way huh 

473.02 473.90 B: yeah he definitely is 

475.17 476.41 B: ou- outspoken dove 

476.68 479.64 A: yes uh eh you know it's interesting that 

479.75 480.18 A: um 

480.76 482.82 A: issues now are not so much about 

484.04 484.79 A: young people 

485.79 488.19 A: having to go off to war to 

488.65 489.71 A: wear a head band 

490.22 491.99 A: with vietnam you know the 

492.22 493.16 A: protests about 

493.89 494.45 A: um 

495.98 496.98 A: invol- you know 

497.17 497.54 A: um 

498.05 502.06 A: the peace protests and and and the draft and all of that 

502.26 505.69 A: it's interesting now that that doesn't hardly ever comes up as an issue 

506.54 508.14 A: as far as um 

506.57 507.05 B: you 

508.40 510.43 A: who's going to fight is you know 

509.81 512.06 B: so the two first of all that there's this issue of 

512.66 513.44 B: yeah as you said 

513.65 515.88 B: who's going to fight it doesn't seem to come up much and also that 

516.18 519.15 B: it doesn't there does not the there's not yet at any rate in any sort of 

522.11 522.50 A: right 

522.19 522.68 B: -mong among 

523.23 524.76 B: could be that you know people of the age 

525.46 528.17 A: that that it would it really impact and really 

528.38 532.74 A: the other ones would have to go out and do it you know um you don't hear it there not i don't think 

532.85 535.01 A: i think they feel insulated or 

536.15 541.24 A: apart from it or something oh that's somebody else some nameless other person that's not them it doesn't 

541.83 542.22 A: doesn't 

542.60 544.34 A: (( )) effect them you know 

544.51 546.76 B: it could also be that it actually at this point has wide 

547.40 549.37 B: spread support among young people (( )) 

550.70 551.71 A: oh you think 

551.56 554.13 B: i don't know it seems like i mean my impression is that 

559.30 559.72 A: hm 

560.46 560.82 B: but um 

560.99 561.38 A: wow 

561.89 569.08 A: i know my my daughter has a boyfriend who's a marine and i i keep asking if he's going to be going over but so far no he's not so
