0.69 3.16 A: hi my name's elvis wagner 

2.92 5.21 B: hi this is denise best 

5.25 6.69 A: hi how're you doing 

6.36 7.50 B: pretty well 

7.43 8.38 A: okay 

9.96 12.75 B: so ah would you like to start the conversation 

12.67 18.31 A: ah sure i guess so what do y- what do you think about the arms inspections in iraq 

19.08 19.99 B: um 

20.43 24.05 B: what little i do know about it is it's a a pretty 

24.54 27.92 B: i wou- it's not a very easy task to tell you the truth 

27.88 29.23 A: yeah definitely 

29.46 31.16 B: uh all aspects 

31.30 32.19 B: um 

32.54 36.25 B: scientifically politically morally 

36.71 41.38 B: there's a lot of questions with not a lot of answers ah 

42.00 43.21 B: in my opinion 

43.21 46.17 A: yeah um [lipsmack] 

46.33 56.51 A: yeah i don't know i i mean a i'm pretty left wing so i think it's very political and i think it's a kind of a well in a lot of ways it's just ah the president trying to 

56.90 57.92 B: payback 

56.95 63.44 A: i don't know defend the honor of his father for you know not finishing the job because he got so much criticism 

63.39 75.03 A: for not you know ten years ago actually going in and getting rid of hussein but i don't think that's a a good reason to actually invade a country but it's kind of bizarre 

75.49 81.64 B: yeah i think it's not a legitimate reason to go i don't think it's a legitim- legitimate reason to go 

75.71 76.58 A: i don't 

77.43 79.24 A: what- what's that 

81.79 88.62 B: and invade another country now i mean w- are we just perpetuating the ill feelings that are already 

83.49 84.74 A: yeah 

88.74 90.58 A: yeah 

89.10 90.07 B: present 

90.62 92.33 A: yeah and i mean 

90.62 92.85 B: and what's in the past has passed 

92.58 103.08 A: i'm just very thankful that at least he did go to the united nations and got the ah you know the security council to [mn] you know the resolution to actually 

101.72 105.55 B: do you think that was just a pony show for the media or 

105.32 108.58 A: yeah i think so i mean i i think 

106.92 110.11 B: we're gonna do whatever we're gonna do no matter what 

108.86 110.38 A: it would have been 

110.62 118.18 A: i think it would been like a political nightmare to not do that i mean he would've had absolutely no allies whatsoever and so 

115.55 116.48 B: oh 

117.28 118.05 B: right 

118.43 131.75 A: i mean i i mean i think they were s- the administration were still very disinclined to consult the u._n. but they i think they just realistically realized that ah if they didn't it would be political suicide for em so 

131.77 132.57 B: right 

132.84 140.81 A: so um i don't know and then whether he actually has weapons of mass destruction i'm a little skeptical about um 

140.97 154.39 A: i mean if he does then i i hope that you know the united nations can actually find them and and you know get rid of them but i'm just you know like you were saying logistically i don't know how feasible that really is 

152.08 165.02 B: i don't think we have ah yeah i i don't i don't think we have the backing of even the united nations even though it says that you know yes we've g- have permission to do the onsite inspections but 

165.04 167.73 B: where's the political clout afterwards 

167.40 170.96 A: yeah well well and so many things you know 

168.06 169.20 B: (( you know what i mean )) 

170.41 182.24 B: right if we find it wh- what's the next step i mean is there a is there a in writing and has it been told to the public what what we will do other than we- we're constantly on our 

172.74 173.64 A: yeah 

182.47 185.54 B: you know ah on our toes about when 

185.69 188.96 B: you know like war is imminent basically 

187.93 197.43 A: yeah yeah well yeah i don't unders- i i i i don't know i live in new york so it's it's a pretty liberal place but in the 

196.57 204.00 B: well i live in well not close not far from washington d._c. so the the mecca of all this [laughter] prob- ah 

199.84 201.15 A: yeah 

203.30 210.14 A: yeah where it's all going down yeah but i i just don't you know i don't hear anyone like 

205.80 207.54 B: yeah exactly i 

210.50 222.00 A: beating the war drums anyone i ever talk to i mean granted that's because i'm living in manhattan so it's probably a little different than if i were in you know the mid west or somewhere but it just doesn't seem like [mn] 

216.69 217.40 B: (( know what )) 

223.15 228.38 A: i don't think they have a convincing case anyway to argue to the public but even if they did um 

228.68 239.04 A: th- i don't think they've done it and people don't people don't seem to be convinced and yet the- there isn't a huge outcry against it and i think to a large extent 

237.38 244.92 B: you're saying but do you think that that has to do with terrorist attacks that have already been perp- perpetuated against the united states 

245.10 250.41 B: and various stories so people are kind of like hesitant at saying no we don't want war 

245.11 246.16 A: um 

246.77 247.88 A: well i 

250.13 251.91 A: yeah i think it's th- 

250.83 253.67 B: 'cause maybe this is gonna be the preemptive 

252.34 262.50 A: i think they're willing to accept the government's assertions and stuff more than they were you know sixteen months ago but but i mean i don't see how anyone can 

262.41 269.58 A: equate this with a direct you know extension of that because it's like yeah it's an entirely different thing 

268.13 273.75 B: right [mn] i know but th- the less educated would probably make that connection 

273.55 275.73 A: yeah yeah and that's 

274.50 277.76 B: and that's what they're they're i think banking on 

277.57 281.21 A: yeah and it's incredibly frustrating for me um 

280.58 291.21 B: oh it is it is i am totally i think y- with power you have responsibility you have to there has to be checks and balances and there has to be some kind of a common sense to its policy 

290.97 292.25 A: yeah 

291.12 304.21 B: otherwise you know this the and i'm not sure if i really truly believe he's trying to you know honor his father by going back in i mean there's other venues he could have chosen instead of something so public you know 

299.09 300.91 A: yeah 

303.31 305.10 A: yeah but i do- 

304.24 308.05 B: they do it all the time it's not a matter of that it can't be done 

308.08 311.35 A: yeah i don't understand it i really don't and 

311.47 319.01 A: ah and that there isn't more outcry it's a i mean also i wonder how much i mean i'm not a conspiracy theorist but ah 

319.29 325.44 A: it's also i mean in case anyone's forgotten which is possible because it's never in the newspaper or on the news but 

325.39 329.93 A: you know public enemy number one osama bin laden apparently is still alive 

329.87 331.60 A: and for some reason 

331.47 345.24 A: you know i wonder if it really is is a you know to get that that whole aspect of it out of the press and you know and concentrate everyone's a- attention on on you know another public enemy that's that's more salient 

340.76 341.86 B: (( mhm i th- )) 

342.67 344.48 B: mm i think 

344.70 348.18 B: honestly i think it's more in the [mn] you know to 

348.53 349.23 B: if 

349.36 356.49 B: if it's it's just like anything else if someone in in a public place points up to the sky everybody [mn] looks up 

356.49 358.42 A: yeah true true true 

356.66 362.09 B: you know kind of deal and i- in fact what we should be looking at is like what's going on at home 

361.90 364.19 A: yeah 

363.12 369.56 B: you know personally that's what i think you know you can't clean other people's backyards if yours is so messed up you know 

365.09 366.58 A: [sigh] yeah no i ag- 

369.07 370.68 A: (( yeah yeah i know it )) 

369.53 384.49 B: you need to [sigh] focus on our policies here at domestically and you know i mean yes we're part of the world and yes we need to there is a time place for everything [noise] but is this really what we want to do is to have you 

370.91 372.61 A: i i agree completely 

384.52 385.30 B: (( know th- )) 

385.63 386.99 B: i mean [mn] 

387.16 392.17 B: what are we going to do as far as i mean it- it's the same pony dance because he's doing it already um 

391.46 393.00 A: wh- i'm sorry what did you say 

392.26 399.34 B: th- with iraq th- saddam hussein is already doing the same thing he did ten years ago nothing has changed 

393.47 394.23 A: (( yes )) 

397.65 398.49 A: yeah 

398.96 400.77 A: very effectively yeah 

400.21 401.98 B: right so uh-huh 

400.57 403.25 A: yeah and not to not of course not to 

403.03 404.27 A: (( ah you know )) 

404.10 408.57 A: f- the whole saddam hussein administration is it's you know 

408.39 419.84 A: it's a horrible administration i agree but [sigh] i don't think that gives us the right just because we're the most powerful country in the world to to go in and dictate our will and our political preferences on a country you know 

412.75 413.35 B: (( ho- )) 

419.80 423.88 A: on the other side of the world that not coincidentally has a huge 

422.96 425.15 B: has a different dogma than us to begin with 

424.66 432.60 A: yeah yeah yeah different culture different everything but also not coincidentally also has a huge amount of oil reserves i mean i i 

431.78 434.36 B: that's something more you're hitting it round on 

433.64 436.26 A: yeah that's definitely a consideration 

435.45 446.03 B: it's not a humanitarian kind of you know we're trying to rid the wor- world of terrorists and bi- biochemical warfare because that's untrue if that's so then why is fort dietrich open you know 

445.84 447.07 A: what's fort dietrich 

446.27 448.79 B: wh- well that's our ah 

448.37 450.18 A: oh okay okay 

449.45 451.08 B: (( you know we're )) 

450.77 460.54 A: yeah yeah that's the other thing it's like um they can't have we- weapons of mass destruction because they're iraq i mean we have more than anyone else but that's totally fine because that's us 

457.24 458.49 B: but we can 

459.96 462.66 B: and if that's so well who's next north korea 

462.45 464.07 A: yeah yeah 

463.02 464.53 B: they've admitted it 

464.12 465.14 A: yeah 

464.54 469.63 B: they've broken up bro- you know broken all the treaties i mean why why not go in there and 

468.07 472.11 A: and to india and pakistan and israel so it's 

469.72 471.23 B: yeah exactly 

471.51 474.53 B: in ah exactly so i mean 

474.56 477.44 B: i don't and truly isn't iraq 

477.54 484.35 B: one of our bad children to begin with [laughter] i mean we've put him in power we just like osama bin laden 

479.69 482.77 A: [laughter] ah yeah yeah that's 

482.86 485.48 A: that's a pretty long list [noise] yeah 

484.63 487.13 B: yeah it is i d- i 

486.56 488.46 A: i i do find that 

487.41 489.15 B: i don't think we should be there 

488.87 494.65 A: yeah i find it very frustrating also th- and i guess that we were talking about this at the beginning i find it very 

495.09 497.02 A: [mn] abhorrent that ah [noise] 

497.28 508.98 A: that the administration is so incredibly cynically connecting this with the war on terrorism when it really has absolutely nothing to do with it you know and i- without a doubt if anything it's going to make 

508.83 514.81 A: you know terrorist acts against the united states much worse you know but they're to to to cloak it in a 

511.79 513.86 B: that- that's exactly my 

515.28 516.77 A: [mn] in the argument that ah 

516.78 524.16 A: you know this i- this is the war on terrorism when it has nothing to do with the war on terrorism except making you know the whole thing much worse a- an- 

524.20 537.07 A: and such a cynical you know abuse of power and then then people falling for it you know and people not arguing with it or questioning it because questioning it would be ah to be not patriotic yeah yeah 

534.16 539.73 B: un american right exactly you're either well and that was a- already based on [sigh] what um 

539.80 541.36 B: president bush had put 

541.88 548.81 B: up front you know either you're with us or you're not you're them or yo- or or you're us and that's not a really good 

542.73 545.63 A: oh yeah you're with us yeah yeah yeah 

546.53 549.06 A: yeah that really pissed me off 

549.44 555.50 B: ideology fo- i mean it's simple it's a it's a cute phrase but it's not not reality 

554.49 568.64 A: yeah yeah and yeah and there's the implication that you know i mean it's just the the you know we know best you know just listen to what we say because if you don't we know better than you and it's like you know i don't think you're 

556.42 558.50 B: there's more to it [laughter] 

569.27 574.75 A: [sigh] perhaps better informed perhaps not but you're definitely not any more intelligent than i am so 

574.60 575.60 B: mm 

575.53 576.50 A: yeah 

575.67 577.77 B: (( i don't know i just )) 

578.27 591.35 B: it's it lends itself to [laughter] different political [sigh] i mean i- isn't this supposed to be a democracy where we i mean i'm not foolish enough to no- to ah to think that we have all the answers but still 

592.09 593.41 B: (( yo- it )) 

593.50 603.36 B: just i don't know i just it's a scary topic to tell you the truth [laughter] and i don't know if i'd i definitely wouldn't want to be in that position to have to make choices 

595.46 596.34 A: yeah 

597.80 599.12 A: yeah definitely 

603.20 604.69 A: yeah 

603.98 606.74 B: but [mn] i do want to be informed 

606.78 612.73 A: yeah and it's also frightening 'cause at this point they've definitely backed themselves into a corner and if they ah you know 

611.63 614.06 B: how do you think this is going to play itself out 

613.65 616.52 A: i don't know i really don't i mean 

617.05 631.08 A: i'm fascinated i was having this discussion last night with a friend and and ah you know the iraqis seem to be playing it really well so far you know politically they're you know they're getting you know they're going along with it you know just enough and they're you know 

631.12 645.80 A: and they're agreeing and they just to the inspections enough and they're complaining about it which is you know understandable but they're going along with it and they're it seems like they're playing along really well and i think you know the world opinion's on their side so i 

643.12 644.75 B: [sigh] so was it w- 

645.01 653.73 B: i unfortunately i think you're i mean not unfortunately but i do think you're correct you know i think iraq is having a has more al- allies in the 

649.32 650.15 A: yeah 

653.85 657.08 A: yeah and they're playing it very well yeah 

654.52 656.15 B: what the outcome is 

656.69 670.10 B: a- then we're the big bad wolf here we're the evil american and it's just ad- adding gunpowder to the fire over here that you know we- we're i think increasing our enemies to tell you the truth 

658.90 660.52 A: yeah yeah yeah yeah 

661.51 662.30 A: yeah 

665.43 666.28 A: yeah 

669.86 677.75 A: yeah so i don't know how it's going to play out it's i- the- you know they just delivered their forty thousand page document to the u._n. yesterday and you know 

677.83 683.69 A: that's got to buy em you know you would think a couple of months of time to to decipher that and go through it all and so 

683.74 687.08 A: it'll be interesting to see what happens i guess we will find out 

686.53 691.96 B: is there going to be also a comparison of what was the last reports too besides what they're saying now and 

691.30 696.35 A: yeah i yeah i think so that's what the inspectors i guess are doing you know and finding out if [mn] 

696.56 699.24 A: what's in the report is actually there so 

699.30 700.73 A: i don't know it'll be 

699.96 711.12 B: [mn] they're implying i know because it [mn] as far as i'm concerned i haven't heard or seen any kind of information from [sigh] the inspectors there hasn't been any forthcoming 

711.43 716.08 B: information from them you know the- other than they've been here they looked at this 

716.45 719.89 B: and they have grim faces and they leave the pa- the i mean that's the 

718.68 719.89 A: yeah yeah
