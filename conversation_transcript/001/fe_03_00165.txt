2.58 6.16 A: uh hello i'm my name is ricky 

5.74 7.60 B: hi i'm david 

7.24 8.51 A: okay 

8.06 9.99 B: and i guess we're talking about holidays 

9.92 12.32 A: right and uh [laughter] 

13.00 18.73 A: i'm not sure i guess we all enjoy holidays but uh i'm not sure i have specific ones that i 

18.87 21.89 A: particularly enjoy more than any others but 

21.42 26.75 B: mhm is there a type of holiday that you like more 

26.83 28.11 B: than any others 

28.26 33.48 A: um basically long holidays [laughter] 

30.19 36.43 B: [laughter] so vacation holidays 

35.73 40.06 A: defin- definitely catching a week a weekend or two on either end 

39.60 43.58 B: [laughter] oh that's funny 

43.00 44.31 A: how 'bout you 

44.47 49.82 B: well i think the holidays i think if i the one that came to mind for me 

51.09 53.23 B: [mn] was thanksgiving 

52.77 54.09 A: mhm 

53.46 56.32 B: um not because of the length 

56.72 61.46 B: but i lo- you know i've had good experiences with um 

61.73 72.56 B: reuniting year after year with a group of friends and family and dining together i i always like you know when when the event itself is pleasant 

70.10 71.12 A: (( yeah )) 

72.52 79.94 B: you know it just builds up a lot of positive associations and i also like the idea of giving thanks and uh appreciating 

80.25 88.83 B: community spirit even though there's been all the the unpleasant side to thanksgiving of you know knowing what happened to the native americans 

81.63 83.05 A: (( mhm )) 

90.07 93.53 B: do you are there any holidays you like like that 

90.36 91.40 A: right 

92.75 100.16 A: yes i suppose that i have similar feelings about thanksgiving be- especially because it's not as commercialized as christmas 

100.47 101.40 B: mhm 

100.83 102.18 A: and uh 

102.25 103.55 A: new years 

103.57 110.03 A: always seems to mean to me sales big sal- new year sales and so forth and everyone goes frantic 

110.12 112.47 A: about it uh 

111.10 112.17 B: yeah 

112.87 115.48 A: i'm not sure about some of the uh 

116.68 121.58 A: more uh political ones although i sort of approve of the idea 

122.16 134.91 A: martin luther king days is a good idea you know except a lot of people pay no attention to who it's for or or what underlies it but it's simply a day off of work but 

123.51 124.61 B: right 

134.33 138.25 B: yeah i agree with you i i i think that uh 

138.74 143.88 B: i that was the other one i was thinking of but i you know to be honest i don't have the warmth 

143.77 156.62 B: be- bec- you know quite likely because i didn't grow up having a delicious meal with beloved you know [laughter] companions on martin luther king day if i had of then i would i would it'd be it'd be very similar to me you know 

150.19 151.53 A: (( but mhm )) 

156.22 167.78 A: well i have some good uh recollections 'cause i there are some i have in the past uh marched in a parade in a sort of martin luther king's day parade um 

166.13 167.30 B: mhm 

167.96 170.00 A: sort of meet meet people 

169.93 178.46 A: sort of like thanksgiving you know uh people you saw last year and you ask 'em what what was happening and and so forth and it's a very uh 

178.35 190.82 A: mixed race kind of thing it's a way of sort of getting together with people i don't always get a together with as much as i'd like so that that definitely has uh some plus 

185.57 187.36 B: mhm 

190.61 192.76 B: oh that sounds great yeah 

191.64 193.95 A: pluses to it 

192.99 196.38 B: so far i just take the day you know i try to take the day off 

196.55 202.04 B: um but i i haven't you know tried to make it into a social 

196.55 197.85 A: mhm 

202.78 210.75 B: uh you know any sort of gathering type of occasion but that's a good idea i'd have to think about it so if you had to create one 

211.06 212.42 B: what would it be 

211.12 218.40 A: b- yes i don't know well i was just remembering the ones that uh school systems created you know snow days w- 

217.79 219.86 B: [laughter] 

219.51 224.55 A: which when you were in school was just wonderful you just call up and uh they're 

225.74 240.33 A: there you'd be oh you don't have to go in you can sleep in later you can and you have this uh it's a surprise day in a way so that you just have this whole day free it's not something you were thinking you were gonna get and therefore you've made some plans about so 

240.26 247.82 A: it's a kind of luxury in a way to know you've got all that uh extra extra time that you haven't uh 

242.16 243.37 B: mhm 

247.91 250.17 A: made any provision for 

250.09 263.99 B: yeah you know i can't help asking this but are you from i know this is a a linguistic research project are you from a background where a holiday is often used for vacation like i'm going on holiday 

262.35 263.39 A: yes 

263.59 265.55 A: yes i'm from london 

265.04 272.00 B: ah okay i figured because i i can tell your association is much more towards vacation 

266.11 267.05 A: (( so that )) 

272.35 277.13 B: than you know hearing the word holiday perhaps th- than mine is i'm i'm 

276.38 280.69 A: right vacation is not a word that we generally use at all 

280.06 281.40 B: yeah 

280.77 284.12 A: and uh so it covers both holy days 

284.28 287.22 A: which is the origin of it i guess and uh 

287.64 291.41 A: the the break from for other purposes 

291.01 293.84 B: yeah yeah 

293.15 293.94 A: um 

293.99 299.87 B: yeah i think yeah when i always think when i was trying to create a holiday of doing the 

300.13 301.38 B: um 

302.61 311.40 B: of of sort of revamping a lot of the holidays so that they're not po- as politically and nationalistically determined but much more 

311.57 317.15 B: based on ideals so you know like uh community and things like that so 

317.47 320.80 A: yeah but that sounds like a great idea yes 

317.55 318.46 B: um 

319.93 329.55 B: [laughter] yeah except you know but of course someone doing that with without the rest of the culture doing that you know it it's you're kind of out of step 

329.83 341.55 B: it's a kind of non conformist thing to do but i you know some holidays about you know like and the things that like earth day for example has been you know has some form of recognition 

338.07 339.23 A: mhm 

341.69 344.75 B: but it it just isn't um 

345.67 349.51 B: you know sometimes on the anniversaries people 

349.80 350.89 A: (( right i )) 

350.31 363.02 B: acknowledge it more but it's a it's a pretty lonely holiday [laughter] you know in terms of you know like once every ten or twenty years people might really stop to observe it but i like the idea of ear- you know days too 

363.31 369.29 A: think you celebrate yourself in a way and i think that's a a nice idea if it 

369.84 373.70 A: makes you look back on what you've uh been doing and uh 

373.72 378.68 A: what your life is like and thinking about whether you want it to be of a peace 

378.64 380.35 B: mhm 

379.24 380.83 A: and what follows 

381.14 387.91 A: but the best days are generally uh tend not to be on days when you still have to work 

387.80 391.23 B: [laughter] unless uh you determine it yourself [laughter] 

390.55 393.64 A: unless you determine it yourself and uh 

393.82 396.85 A: you know i'm always sick on my birthday 

396.74 398.88 B: [laughter] 

397.19 402.30 A: and and so forth but [laughter] i don't know how often you can get away with that 

400.46 401.20 B: [laughter] 

401.77 403.46 B: (( right )) 

402.69 404.59 A: but but anyway 

404.69 405.90 A: that uh 

405.97 410.27 A: yeah i've always en- enjoyed uh you know going to other people's 

410.33 415.77 A: eightieths or ninetieths sometimes and talking with them 

415.63 417.05 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

416.90 420.75 A: but uh anyway uh i can't think of any 

421.13 426.20 A: special kind of holiday that that's needed i i think 

426.75 436.81 A: uh basically if i make this uh blend between a holiday and vacation one thing i notice about the united states and england is that the 

437.51 443.31 A: amount of vacation is uh cons- considerably less than in most of europe 

443.51 445.72 A: of of continental europe 

446.03 455.55 A: and that there's much more of a a work ethic in the anglo countries which means that you spend most of your most of your life when you're younger 

455.58 463.34 A: at work and you you don't have that sort of you know the month of au- whole month of august 

456.48 457.42 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

464.48 467.05 A: that the french have for example 

467.07 472.30 A: in which you can sort of do things and plan things and do various kinds of things 

472.53 474.43 A: not occupy the whole 

474.77 479.38 A: the whole time with with just one particular thing that you enjoy 

480.47 484.86 B: even um australia has uh a month 

484.94 491.12 B: or at least every several years right people australians get to take a long holiday 

490.64 493.71 A: (( um and academics get a )) 

492.23 498.52 B: well i think they get a year they get a year off and they do a lot of major travelling and academics get sabbaticals 

498.03 499.88 A: sabbaticals right then 

499.93 506.01 A: those are nice like what are they they're years at uh full pay or 

506.60 518.63 A: half a year a full year at half pay i think in most places and some are more generous than that and you're supposed to i suppose you're supposed to sort of do things that you're 

519.03 520.97 A: interested in and uh 

521.03 523.93 A: will help you from not to perish 

524.83 531.93 A: if if it's a publish or perish thing uh actually i guess that isn't relevant 'cause you will already have to have tenure when you 

532.77 535.40 A: wh- uh when you take a sabbatical 

535.24 540.51 B: mhm although there are cases where people get sabbaticals before that like uh 

540.90 541.90 A: mhm 

540.92 543.69 B: there's i know definitely some universities 

543.77 553.66 B: uh which is a very con- considerate you know allows people who are preparing for tenure to take a sabbatical so they they use that time to write books or 

553.84 554.81 B: try 

553.87 556.96 A: yeah that's a that's a wonderful way to do it 

556.36 560.56 B: yeah [laughter] going back to the publish or perish 

561.04 570.68 B: uh concept but yeah i always think that for holidays you know something like i guess there is an earth day but i don't think there's a peace day 

563.35 564.38 A: right 

570.94 573.13 B: or at least not one that is uh 

572.42 574.90 A: no there isn't [laughter] 

574.05 576.99 B: yeah not one that's widely you know i'm you know 

577.06 584.54 B: there there must be some peace days somehow you know like a u._n. thing or whatever but i i'm not familiar with one 

584.66 592.82 A: yeah there is a united nations day it's not usually a a holiday probably would be uh politically unacceptable to some groups 

592.68 593.54 B: (( mm )) 

594.26 600.11 A: who regard the uh u._n. as a kind of left wing conspiracy the 

598.40 605.80 B: yeah [laughter] but you know it would be interesting you know uh if if the calendar were really constructed around 

605.62 616.23 B: i mean i think originally holidays or in many cases holidays were you know very much tied to um you know harvests and all sorts of 

615.30 616.68 A: seasons 

616.47 621.20 B: natural phenomenon or you know efforts between nature and people 

621.27 630.92 B: uh you know the cycles of the month maybe and the seasons changing and all of that and uh the the the number of political holidays that a country celebrates 

631.49 632.59 A: mhm 

632.20 633.34 B: (( you know just )) 

634.14 636.46 B: uh they they they're 

638.85 640.24 A: they're just breaks 

639.21 650.45 B: they're not as unifying i i i think in a lot of ways you know in the short run they might be unifying when when people still h- have strong feelings about them but over time they often lose value 

650.12 652.68 A: they just take 'em for granted 

652.35 653.33 B: yeah 

652.75 654.15 A: right but 

654.38 658.15 A: i suppose that well christmas and uh 

658.54 661.03 A: easter and so forth are all uh 

661.20 670.66 A: are actually uh seasonal things that the christianity and uh judaism adopted like judaism adopted what the easter 

671.13 678.38 A: kind of thing i think the timing i don't know when jesus was supposed to have died someone told me it was september 

672.55 673.64 B: mhm 

678.89 680.27 B: oh really 

679.69 680.84 A: (( but uh )) 

681.07 682.48 B: (( well i but )) 

681.15 687.17 A: they they wanted to re- recruit the pagans who celebrate the winter festival 

687.55 690.73 A: so that's how it got to be in december 

691.81 697.34 A: (( and easter was named after aester or something some pagan festival )) 

697.52 708.10 A: and uh so the resurrection was conveniently dated at that at that time i guess it's a way of sort of uh taking over a holiday and uh 

698.75 699.80 B: yeah 

708.34 710.71 A: pushing the other group out 

710.77 712.66 B: yeah i think that the uh 

713.15 716.10 B: in the case of easter i think it's still 

716.20 719.68 B: if the last supper was a um a sater
