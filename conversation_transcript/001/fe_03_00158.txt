376.89 377.23 A: but 

378.27 382.02 B: there must be an end to this but i think 

382.75 384.18 B: ye 

384.63 388.04 B: peaceful solutions are always better because 

386.94 387.71 A: that's true 

387.94 389.23 A: the question is 

388.15 392.21 B: violence brings violence violence brings more violence and 

392.54 394.77 A: but do you think that there can be 

395.01 401.34 A: i mean do you think that there is anything that anybody can do that would you know to tame saddam and they can 

401.64 403.64 A: like a nice leader 

403.05 405.56 B: i think that he is right now 

405.80 412.41 B: causing a lot of pain for his own citizens too so that regime has to change 

409.97 410.35 A: yeah 

413.04 422.58 A: do you do you think that the america can change it do you think that they can even say win the war and they disarm iraq do you think they can cause a good change 

413.87 414.27 B: yes 

420.79 427.65 B: i hope so i hope so but you know nobody can be sure if they can 

428.13 428.74 B: like 

428.93 430.66 B: take the power from him 

431.10 431.84 A: mhm 

431.60 433.04 B: and 

433.26 437.11 B: help develop a more stable government over there 

437.40 438.74 B: which uh gives more 

437.56 437.94 A: yeah 

439.10 440.43 B: like uh 

440.83 442.69 B: freedom to their own people 

442.81 443.54 B: and which is 

443.63 445.02 B: uh more peaceful 

445.50 446.67 B: that would be very 

446.91 448.68 B: very good for the region 

448.85 449.24 A: yeah 

449.08 452.19 B: yeah but you know 

450.72 451.22 A: i don't know 

452.55 457.37 A: i've grown really pessimistic lately i was i remember i was 

457.20 457.66 B: uh-huh 

457.58 466.75 A: i was i still am basically hoping that you know peaceful solutions can be made and changes can be made but now i don't even 

466.18 467.33 B: yeah 

466.93 473.37 A: oh a. i don't believe in peaceful solutions anymore and b. i'm sort of disillusioned with everything i'm not even sure i mean i'm not 

470.22 470.70 B: mhm 

473.68 474.99 A: i don't think 

475.14 476.57 B: you don't think that could happen 

475.17 476.55 A: much will change 

477.07 477.48 B: yeah 

477.59 479.32 A: and and still i mean (( )) 

485.40 485.83 A: mhm 

485.76 486.38 B: um 

486.71 488.58 B: but i don't know if they've (( )) 

491.72 497.22 A: do you know what what the public opinion 

491.91 492.72 B: or not 

497.39 498.49 A: the u._s. or 

497.90 498.78 B: um 

498.88 502.03 B: i don't know i think people don't want war 

502.14 510.46 B: you know that word is not a very uh like attractive war nobody wants war 

508.15 508.71 A: do you think 

509.44 515.98 A: do you think turkey is in in danger at all do you do you think if something happens then 

516.22 517.37 A: then it might reach 

517.51 518.65 A: that that far 

517.54 518.51 B: mm 

519.98 522.43 B: yeah i don't know but 

523.36 525.68 B: they can not threaten turkey because 

526.46 528.03 B: turkey has a very strong 

529.55 531.06 B: military action 

530.86 533.59 A: yeah but still it's considered to be uh 

532.01 538.35 B: but uh last time during kuwait war we supported the united states 

536.22 536.52 A: yeah 

539.87 542.67 B: we were very much affected 

543.01 544.12 B: economically 

544.94 548.07 B: turkey was really effected economically 

547.84 548.51 A: really 

548.37 550.75 B: but other then that we didn't 

551.11 552.47 B: there wasn't like any 

552.79 553.73 B: uh 

554.45 562.13 B: action from iraq to turkey but no uh the economy really went very bad 

557.26 557.61 A: mhm 

562.36 563.20 A: really because 

562.60 570.00 B: lot of people lost their jobs and stuff there was nobody came we relied very much on prison 

570.14 570.51 A: yes 

570.61 576.23 B: nobody wanted to come to turkey because they thought it was dangerous all though there was no danger for anybody 

576.55 578.92 A: during the war or after the war 

579.60 580.78 B: during 

580.67 581.20 A: mhm 

581.04 584.00 B: and sometime after and then it's 

584.55 586.08 B: it became okay again 

586.74 588.58 B: maybe one or two years later 

586.82 587.19 A: yeah 

589.55 590.22 B: after that 

590.88 591.32 A: yeah 

592.11 593.31 B: yeah but uh 

592.42 592.83 A: i 

594.19 597.99 A: i just feel that in a way i mean it seems to me that 

594.51 595.46 B: i don't know 

598.13 598.82 A: uh 

599.28 610.79 A: american administration have already made up their minds and nothing is going to change it i mean now they are they're talking about this report that iraq made about where they i mean talking about their 

602.64 603.12 B: uh-huh 

611.04 620.38 A: past uh nuclear programs and stuff and and which is supposedly being analyzed right now in washington and other places 

615.09 615.71 B: mhm 

619.65 625.09 B: yeah they i saw some documents and stuff being carried to the united states 

626.62 627.67 B: on the news 

632.95 633.45 B: mhm 

638.24 639.35 A: very well change 

639.46 641.54 A: much of what has been planned 

639.73 640.17 B: mhm 

642.02 647.26 B: yeah i think the first thing should be eh what they are doing right now 

647.71 657.37 B: the is the first step to be taken and if nothing works then their will be no other solution then going to war or doing something 

647.80 648.19 A: mhm 

657.58 658.10 A: yeah 

657.81 658.80 B: some (( )) 

672.11 672.50 B: yeah 

672.24 672.69 A: of 

672.79 675.52 A: eh eh eh moral strain i think 

675.66 678.02 A: american is going to suffer if they go to war 

682.80 683.18 B: yeah 

689.36 695.75 A: people they ask people where in the world was iraq they asked them to like point to it on the map 

695.35 696.16 B: uh-huh 

695.87 700.79 A: and i think the vast majority where it is 

700.35 704.28 B: yeah they don't know and i think because it's so remote 

704.63 709.58 B: uh people think that like it it's not going to affect me directly and 

710.26 710.69 A: yeah 

711.38 714.31 B: i don't care what happens to other people 

715.63 716.16 A: well
