0.00 1.16 B: hi 

0.63 2.00 A: hi 

1.63 2.62 B: (( how're you doing )) 

2.25 3.45 A: good how are you 

3.04 4.05 B: okay 

3.64 7.46 A: [noise] um how do you feel about iraq [noise] 

6.80 9.20 B: how do i feel about iraq um 

9.24 18.01 B: [lipsmack] well i think it's a messy situation i don't i don't think we [sigh] should be going to war but i think ah it's not something 

18.28 23.66 B: that we can just sit by and watch unfold so i feel kind of ambivalent 

21.03 22.00 A: right 

23.78 26.03 B: at this point what do yo- how about you 

25.64 29.86 A: um i personally feel really uncomfortable with the idea of 

29.80 42.58 A: bombing the country um because we disagree with the leader um i feel like it's the job that the u._n. should handle as opposed to the united states and i feel like the u._n. has done an adequate jobs of 

34.08 35.15 B: yeah 

42.74 48.66 A: an adequate job of arms inspections in the past and we should [noise] just turn it over to them 

48.26 49.49 B: mhm 

48.86 59.39 A: because um [mn] i've actually like not really read a lot about this but i've i've had a couple of discussions about it and it seems like they they interviewed um 

59.44 67.16 A: an an arms inspector from the past who has actually gone and checked and he says that there's really no way that iraq can have 

66.99 75.86 A: all of the weapons that we think it can have because the rest of the world would have known about it because they would've had to purchase things somewhere and 

69.03 70.07 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

74.67 76.51 B: right right right 

76.18 80.05 A: so i i feel really uncomfortable with all this you know we should 

80.27 82.13 A: just go in and like 

82.21 90.29 A: dethrone saddam hussein because i feel like that's putting us in a position that we don't necessarily want to be in 

84.54 85.47 B: (( yes )) 

89.97 98.78 B: right well i don't want to be in that position [laughter] i don't know if our current administration feels the same way i mean i guess i agree with you that um 

98.70 111.32 B: [lipsmack] at least for the time being it's more appropriate for the u._n. to be calling the shots so to speak and figuring out what needs to be done and i mean i think we need to give the arms inspections an adequate opportunity to work 

111.35 113.67 B: before we decide what might 

113.78 119.10 B: come next and i feel like the bush administration isn't really doing that i feel like they're 

119.18 122.66 B: you know jumping the gun as it were um 

120.98 121.91 A: yeah 

122.39 127.20 A: i definitely agree with that and i i feel like the media is trying to um 

127.53 129.58 A: kind of turn the whole 

129.35 142.89 A: like iraq as an entire entity into something that's bad whereas in we may not like i'd probably i don't know like saddam hussein personally obviously but i'm i'm guessing that i would not agree with him or 

142.71 150.26 A: support any of his policies but it's it's really different than like bombing a country because we don't like one person 

147.64 148.56 B: yeah 

149.92 154.12 B: sure i mean i think i think it's mo- a little more [sigh] 

154.06 166.70 B: deeply rooted than just him i mean i think the administration as a whole is evil and doing horrible things to oppress the citizens of the country and i i think that the nat- the uh world needs to 

155.90 156.84 A: right 

158.76 159.62 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

162.96 163.99 A: mhm 

166.62 176.46 B: respond to that in some way i mean it seems like sanctions are ineffective just because they're doing more harm than good for the citizens of the nation and i 

174.49 175.41 A: right 

176.35 182.66 B: but i don't know what the solution is i mean i think the arms inspections is i think that's a really good idea 

182.34 183.31 A: mhm 

182.63 195.61 B: um and i'm glad to see that happening and you know i think it needs to we just need to kind of hold our horses for the time being and and wait and see what the results of that are but what happens when you know let's assume that 

195.52 207.47 B: the worst comes true and the arms inspectors come back and say okay well there are all these dangerous things going on what should the response of the world be at that point i mean that's what makes me really nervous 

200.49 201.31 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

207.50 214.88 B: um and i also don't trust the bush administration to accept what the arms inspectors come back with 

214.87 228.71 B: as the final the final say on the matter like if the arms inspectors come back and say okay well it looks pretty clean and you know there was this suspicious stuff and we destroyed it but everything else looks good i think the bush administration is going to come forth at that point and say 

228.52 237.12 B: yeah but we have evidence that you don't have access to and and you know i mean it's a messy situation and i don't think there's a clean a clean solution 

230.68 231.81 A: (( [noise] right )) 

236.89 250.22 A: i i definitely agree that i would not trust the bush administration um very far at all um simply because i yo- i never know exactly what they're telling us and the whole precedent set by 

250.73 256.17 A: i don't know the i this is it's a very different situation with the whole bombing of afghanistan i feel 

256.41 258.18 A: like that was again 

258.58 266.25 A: kind of like the bush administration taking on powers that it it didn't necessarily have in the world community um 

264.76 265.87 B: yeah 

266.40 271.43 A: you know everyo- everyone's against terrorists but it's 

269.84 270.70 B: (( true )) 

271.63 277.78 A: it's very different to go in and say we think there are terrorists here and therefore we're going to drop a bomb 

277.48 281.69 B: so what's what is the appropriate response in that kind of situation 

281.01 289.76 A: [noise] again i would go to the u._n. and world community as a whole and attempt to you know isolate a- al qaeda as opposed to um 

289.94 300.89 A: bombing i don't know i'm kind of a a pacifist i guess i don't believe that the war war is answer to any of our questions about what's going on i think that 

297.74 298.71 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

301.00 309.65 A: everything not ev- like i understand that negotiations can only go so far but honestly like negotiation should always be the first step 

309.03 310.16 B: mhm 

309.74 312.03 A: and uh i 

311.97 326.30 B: so what do you do [laughter] i mean i agree with you essentially i think negotiations need to be given quite a long time to work but it doesn't always work and i mean what do you do with a nutca- i think saddam h- hussein is a nutcase i think he's a complete 

312.06 312.62 A: (( [noise] )) 

317.18 318.09 A: right 

319.43 320.71 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

326.15 329.19 B: you know power hungry um 

329.21 336.72 B: whatever i think he's crazy and i think he's doing horrible horrible things to the citizens of his country 

331.25 332.66 A: [laughter] 

336.20 337.16 A: mhm 

336.55 345.61 B: and i think he's you know trampling over human rights at every turn and i th- you know ideally the united states should use its 

345.42 352.37 B: power and influence to [sigh] somehow improve the the life 

352.36 362.53 B: you know the quality of life of people around the world and if if getting rid of that guy is the way to do it then super but i mean how do you do that without inflicting more harm 

362.77 370.05 B: on people than than bringing about positive change you know like what do you do when negotiations fail 

367.57 368.38 A: yeah 

370.10 371.50 A: (( um [noise] )) 

370.61 372.93 B: 'cause they're not going to work with a guy like that 

372.39 376.03 A: that's true and that's a very valid point but um 

376.24 380.53 A: i i guess it would we would have another desert storm where 

380.55 390.14 A: um it's kind of a u._s. led attack but again it's the u._n. i feel like anything that's purely u._s. is kind of a power trip and anything [noise] 

384.28 385.15 B: yeah 

387.31 388.21 B: mhm 

390.06 398.21 A: that i mean even if it's even if everyone agrees with it i think everyone needs to get behind it and not just have the u._s. be a police force type thing 

397.27 411.78 B: yeah well i mean it seems like the bush administration is at least for the time being going to sh- you know wait things out with the arms inspections but you know who knows what's going to happen after that point like i really don't think 

405.90 406.91 A: right 

411.99 422.52 B: the i mean this is sad to say but i don't really think the final answer of the arms inspectors is going to matter a bit in what bush um decides to go ahead and do w- 

417.82 418.63 A: right 

422.53 423.51 A: yeah 

423.18 425.19 B: (( at that point and that's concerning )) 

424.02 433.30 A: um my concern is that um europe or at least before the um arms inspection were going in when the u._s. was talking about attacking it in october 

433.00 433.82 B: mhm 

433.19 445.89 A: um europe had kind of said as a whole [noise] that they would not support an invasion of iraq and that it would be a u._s. led attack and that kind of gets me concerned about um 

438.93 440.07 B: right 

440.94 442.11 B: yeah 

446.15 458.11 A: you know whether or not that this is really a a legitimate thing if if other you know world powers are not willing to step in is this just us saying we want oil you know 

454.36 455.28 B: mhm 

457.34 467.63 B: yeah well but come on europe wants oil too [laughter] you know like i don't think that's a i think that's a western concern and not specifically a u._s. concern so 

459.68 460.66 A: right 

460.92 462.28 A: right right right 

464.84 465.72 A: right 

466.58 467.43 A: right 

467.86 477.78 B: i don't know i i i don't know exactly know what bush's motivation is um [mn] yeah no i think oil is a part of it for sure but i don't think that 

471.96 472.82 A: okay 

477.97 484.29 B: saying it's oil is adequate because certainly all western nations have an interest in 

484.41 487.40 B: in access to cheap oil you know 

486.14 487.05 A: right 

487.16 490.81 A: then why do we feel the need to step in when europe doesn't [laughter] 

490.47 491.99 B: (( [mn] yeah i don't know )) 

492.16 498.64 B: i don't know i mean i think europe probably has more to lose being in the same continent as [laughter] as iraq 

497.97 498.96 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

498.64 509.11 B: you know i think they're probably more c- more ah cautious and also you know have fewer financial resources to devote to a a prolonged ugly dirty war 

508.71 509.66 A: right 

509.26 512.26 B: you know i think probably the u._s. has [mn] 

512.74 525.46 B: i i don't know i don't know it's just a messy ugly scary depressing [laughter] situation no matter how you look at it and i mean i i've i agree with you essentially that the arms inspections are 

518.40 519.98 A: yes [laughter] 

520.03 521.32 A: i agree [noise] 

525.28 537.88 B: a good idea and necessary and should be given every opportunity to work but i i honestly don't believe that the arms inspections are going to un- unveil everything that's going on inside of iraq 

537.62 538.51 A: right 

537.90 546.04 B: you know like there's got to be stuff that's happening that we're never going to have access to and i'm sure that's true within the u._s. as well 

545.51 546.43 A: mhm 

546.14 548.45 B: you know and so ugh 

548.28 555.39 A: iraq does not have nuclear capabilities is that correct it's just germ and biological warfare that 

554.53 558.49 B: well as far as people know yeah i think that's that's true 

556.21 557.10 A: okay 

558.68 560.02 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

559.47 568.80 A: [mn] you know and atomic we- when you start talking about atomic weapons that's where it get really scary and that's when i would you know want people to go in and 

568.86 573.03 A: i mean obviously like biological warfare is is a pretty scary thing 

572.31 583.78 B: yeah i think the biochemical thing is terrifying i mean did you see tariq aziz on nightline the other night well they found mustard gas you know it's um plant and ted koppel's like well 

577.13 578.06 A: no 

579.51 580.50 A: oh 

583.87 588.63 B: you know what about the mustard gas and tariq aziz said oh that's so eighties 

588.48 590.85 A: [laughter] 

589.03 589.72 B: (( a )) 

589.78 595.39 B: [mn] okay yeah but it still kills people you know [laughter] i mean i think this stuff is 

592.37 593.91 A: right exactly [laughter] 

595.30 605.90 B: pretty scary and okay so you know they don't have the the atom bomb but [mn] mustard gas is going to do some serious damage i mean you know 

596.37 597.34 A: yeah 

604.61 605.52 A: right 

606.23 617.48 B: i don't know i don't i have a hard time balancing my my general tendencies to say you know war is bad and do what you can to avoid it and try everything else first 

617.01 618.05 A: exactly 

617.39 623.28 B: with my other sense that the iraqi administration is truly evil 

622.86 623.87 A: [laughter] 

623.59 628.46 B: and you know really doing horrible horrible things and it's 

626.64 627.53 A: yeah 

628.68 629.88 B: what do you do 

628.71 631.27 A: yeah i i totally agree with that it's just 

631.30 633.55 A: i i feel um 

633.65 645.39 A: you know in the cold war when it was just reaching that point when we had the bomb and they had the bomb and we're both threatening to and it's it's it's one of those things where if they threaten to use biological warfare well 

638.05 639.01 B: yeah 

644.23 645.10 B: right 

645.51 653.61 A: we have theoretically an atomic weapon at our easy disposal that's just and that's incredibly frightening to me that 

649.47 650.55 B: oh sure 

652.85 654.08 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

653.77 668.56 A: like war in this age would necessarily involve like very schem- scary chemicals and very like explosive things i mean i'm a chemistry major and i know like all these things that it can do to you and that's it's not pleasant 

659.42 660.38 B: yeah 

661.01 662.36 B: mhm 

665.58 666.85 B: yeah 

667.94 668.97 B: no 

668.76 669.84 A: so 

669.31 672.74 B: that's pretty terrifying i mean if you think about it in 

672.79 679.12 B: you know without just like a passing thought if you actually dwell on it i mean why get out of bed [laughter] you know 

675.99 676.88 A: right 

677.70 680.36 A: (( [laughter] )) 

679.36 681.48 B: it's like too darn depressing 

681.00 682.00 A: right 

682.06 684.27 A: and you know i i have 

684.75 692.78 A: [mn] i wish there was an easy solution for the people in iraq and you know it makes you wonder whether 

687.03 688.06 B: (( yeah )) 

689.01 690.08 B: yeah 

692.96 697.49 A: i wonder personally whether or not they like saddam or whether they don't 

696.92 701.84 B: [mn] well i guess it's impossible to know because the citizens are 

699.77 700.72 A: right 

701.90 707.96 B: at least if you believe what you hear the citizens live in fear of any repercussions of 

707.18 708.36 A: right 

708.14 717.37 B: of speaking their minds but just knowing what the party line of of saddam's administration is how could people feel 

717.44 719.89 B: happy [laughter] and comfortable and accept
