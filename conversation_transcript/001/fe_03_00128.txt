95.87 96.44 B: right 

97.14 97.41 B: i 

104.38 105.62 A: you'd think people be a 

104.45 104.92 B: right 

106.77 109.30 A: you know quote unquote civilized enough to a 

109.65 110.51 B: no i agree

121.03 122.78 A: well i certainly do not get 

122.99 123.64 A: how 

124.26 124.92 A: um 

133.11 143.14 A: everywhere i look ever somebody says (( )) no we don't think it's a good idea you know including the army the you know some of the inspectors the rest of the world you know a a large ma- 

141.61 142.14 B: right 

142.44 143.07 B: but then the 

143.70 144.15 B: yeah 

144.73 154.48 A: you know percentage of people here but i don't know it's just it's just crazy because you know it it is i think it happens to pretty much anybody that whatever's going on is not 

155.09 155.64 A: cause 

156.04 157.20 A: by the fact 

157.45 157.87 A: that 

158.28 159.44 A: saddam is considered 

159.91 167.00 A: a different kind of threat now than he was you know half a year a year ago you know i mean 

164.92 165.43 B: mhm 

165.91 173.21 B: i think now america will now take him seriously and they want him out because it's the first time 

173.60 176.71 B: eh america's history for this generation 

177.03 179.16 B: to know being hit 

179.57 180.22 B: at home 

180.65 182.44 A: right well that's that the 

181.01 186.44 B: by the twi- by the towers but i'm not saying but the if you talk to the older generation about um 

186.56 196.58 B: japan and bombing bombing pearl harbor they're like it's the same thing it's just now our generation and everybody's so well how dare they 

197.69 199.83 A: well see the thing is i'm from soviet union 

200.14 200.71 B: mhm 

200.23 206.08 A: or former soviet union well the world war two is like a huge thing much more than here i mean 

205.60 206.01 B: right 

206.47 211.00 A: like uh in the republic that i'm from every fourth person died so 

211.18 211.66 A: like 

212.17 212.73 A: you know 

212.94 214.59 A: big thing and 

215.21 217.12 A: this is by no means 

217.22 217.87 A: like that 

217.97 222.58 B: oh no not at all and i don't and i don't mean to to say it was but 

222.29 223.43 A: oh no no 

222.76 225.82 B: saying to if you talk to the americans today 

226.73 228.09 B: they are more hot 

226.99 228.23 A: all right but that's the wrong 

228.51 229.41 A: it's the wrong percep- 

228.83 234.51 B: it's more retribution it's more re- about retribution now than it is about if you 

234.92 238.41 B: maybe if you ask someone ten years ago about 

239.22 246.89 B: the same thing going on except with except without the twin towers and everything that happened okay except that little nine eleven if you took 

247.55 253.38 B: this scenario ten years ago about the weapons and the inspectors some people would have 

253.67 258.37 B: some people would care some people wouldn't but people would just go on now because 

257.55 259.55 A: but but what does that have to do with uh 

259.66 261.14 A: with september eleventh 

259.94 269.90 B: because now the because of nine eleven more people have more of an opinion to let's erase the person let's go after them let's let's destroy them 

267.60 268.02 A: (( )) 

270.40 274.88 B: because it it home they know someone they know someone who died 

270.69 272.79 A: right but i mean as i said 

275.67 277.30 A: right oh i mean i can (( )) 

282.11 284.24 B: one of every uh four people died so 

300.09 300.80 B: no 

306.21 313.66 A: with afghanistan to make sure nothing like that ever happens again in afghanistan not abandoning afghanistan to fight 

313.78 316.15 A: a war in iraq for basically i think 

316.25 321.69 A: pretty much everybody knows it's oil um i mean it's not that oil is the only reason but it's 

321.99 323.42 B: well you know what 

322.08 324.33 A: you know a a huge part of it 

324.39 325.81 B: i know for a fact 

326.44 327.01 B: that 

327.13 332.99 B: america has enough oil right now that we don't have to touch a drop from any of saudi arabia forever 

333.26 338.99 B: i know that for a fact no my father my father was one of the number one guys of the oil industry 

333.46 334.81 A: oh but it's not i don't 

339.45 340.02 B: and 

340.16 342.65 B: there's enough oil within the united states 

343.56 352.38 B: they'll never do it cause they don't want to take the stock pile away but you know that's just an old economical money thing but as far as the inspectors i mean 

350.09 351.23 A: well it's just (( )) 

352.80 353.49 B: i think 

354.56 358.74 B: (( )) like just they said bush says well they lied on their report 

359.42 361.90 B: there are weapons of mass destruction 

362.79 363.24 B: and 

363.36 367.95 B: iraq iran says no there's not well what are you going to do call them a liar how are you going to prove it 

368.47 372.30 B: the inspectors didn't see anything because if they did have it they hid it 

373.09 377.65 A: well but that's kind of you know there's there's an argument that says that uh 

377.78 378.45 A: um 

378.91 384.95 A: neander- neanderthals must have had wireless telegraph why because there there nobody found any wires 

385.30 388.76 B: right right so obviously it had to be 

387.60 388.83 A: but that's not a that's 

388.93 396.72 A: but i mean inspections do the relatively good job the last time they were there and this time they have a much stronger mandate and uh 

393.39 393.89 B: mhm 

397.16 400.43 A: if if uh america wants iraq 

400.85 401.75 A: to disarm 

402.24 409.98 A: don't you think it makes sense for america to share intelligence with the inspectors so they can can actually go into the sites where there are weapons of and i mean 

408.12 408.81 B: i agree 

409.60 410.15 B: yeah 

410.27 412.79 A: the the evidence has not been forthcoming 

410.73 411.98 B: the more information 

412.86 417.28 B: yes the more information that they give the u._n. inspectors to go in 

417.50 424.37 B: the better the chances of the u._n. inspectors number one proving if that's the case proving it right 

425.35 429.20 B: and if it's not the case then america's or put bush 

429.78 433.67 B: and his people should believe the inspectors i don't i don- i don't think you 

434.70 444.86 B: i mean from the panel that is the inspectors i don't see any one of them having a good reason to lie considering you're talking about their livelihood and their lives 

445.03 449.89 A: well plus they're international committee they're it's not like one you know it's like they're all from 

448.37 448.74 B: right 

450.24 451.32 A: iraq or anything 

451.14 458.05 B: right so it's it's a cross section of everybody just for that reason so 

458.36 465.88 B: why i i don't see them lying that they're saying something but you never know i mean that's the sad thing you just never ever know 

466.34 470.20 A: right well but that's that's why i said i don't understand i mean 

470.34 473.41 A: it is very hard for me to understand bush because 

473.89 475.57 A: the reason for the war 

475.67 476.66 A: well you know 

477.08 487.55 A: he he knew even inevitable war in iraq um you should've heard you should've heard (( wolfitz )) talking yesterday about how he said that if you he was basically using the argument that you were using that if 

487.72 493.13 A: if they find weapons then (( )) then we were right we should go in and destroy every- if they don't find weapons then they're still there 

504.69 506.68 A: if the only reason for 

506.85 514.79 A: you know this escalation of situation was a sudden fear of weapons of mass destruction what about north korea who 

515.00 518.47 A: probably already has them and said they have them and you know 

518.47 518.86 B: right 

518.75 523.76 A: the and nothing happened you know you'd you'd think it'd be exactly the same thing right 

520.41 520.79 B: (( )) 

521.43 522.09 B: look at 

522.85 524.95 B: look at india with the nuclear warheads 

525.20 531.95 B: look at look at india who has the ability you know they do have nuclear warheads and everything else and for a little bit there's a lot of rumbling 

540.32 546.00 B: disarm and everything else and everybody was for it i mean and india's like yeah okay right we still have it that's that 

546.74 547.71 A: right i mean it's not 

547.50 551.80 B: and they still have it they still have their nuclear capability nothing happened 

547.82 548.18 A: i mean 

552.29 552.67 B: (( i just )) 

557.38 561.89 A: you know nuclear war with (( )) india and pakistan just at each others throats
