50.79 51.41 B: yeah 

51.25 52.20 A: i'd agree with that 

51.96 53.39 B: okay yeah 

52.63 53.09 A: um 

53.82 55.66 B: yeah i mean of course 

53.89 54.29 A: right 

55.79 59.52 B: i i think that the united na- united nations has been really 

60.16 60.72 B: um 

61.10 63.70 B: has been made really ridiculous in the sense that they 

63.80 65.29 B: they haven't been able to 

65.86 68.43 B: find out whether he has nuclear arms or not 

68.75 69.11 A: right 

69.35 69.91 B: but 

70.23 70.87 B: um 

71.11 71.77 B: but 

72.18 72.73 B: i 

73.15 75.36 B: don't know if this is the right way to 

75.63 76.28 B: go about 

77.67 83.71 B: doing it i mean especially now what is he going to do i haven't read today's paper but what is he going to 

82.05 82.47 A: uh-huh 

83.86 84.66 B: uh now that 

85.49 86.84 B: now that the um 

87.36 87.90 B: saddam 

88.04 88.64 B: produced 

89.79 90.28 B: twelve 

90.67 95.18 B: thousand page documents that he (( )) he doesn't have the arms 

95.50 95.91 A: right 

96.41 97.84 A: i i didn't hear about that but then 

97.59 100.15 B: yeah i think it was in yesterday's paper 

98.07 98.78 A: sounds interesting 

100.18 100.95 A: yeah hm 

101.36 104.06 B: and um i mean what is he going to do now (( )) 

104.35 106.63 B: he's saying that it's it's a lie 

107.48 108.83 B: and you know go ahead and 

109.17 110.79 B: bomb them anyway 

110.63 111.74 A: right yeah i 

112.04 112.96 A: i've thought about that 

113.11 113.81 B: yeah 

113.25 114.46 A: i mean because he seems determined 

114.89 117.86 A: i mean you ca- it's kind of using the arms inspections as an excuse to just 

115.13 115.70 B: yeah 

118.19 119.40 A: get rid of saddam hussein 

119.57 121.38 B: uh yeah yeah 

119.85 120.21 A: i think 

120.74 121.38 A: so i mean 

121.89 124.29 A: he just kind of wants to solve that or whatever but 

121.92 122.33 B: that's a 

124.73 125.41 B: yeah 

125.71 129.43 A: i mean if they don't find anything when with these inspections you know 

129.59 130.32 B: right 

130.11 130.98 A: what's he going to do 

131.10 132.13 A: then 

131.92 133.39 B: then again would that be 

133.92 134.46 B: what kind of 

134.55 135.97 B: solution would that be 

136.26 137.03 B: i mean 

137.48 137.99 B: the i 

138.12 138.63 B: doubt that 

139.09 140.47 B: saddam hussein is the last 

142.43 147.82 B: nutcase in this world so there will always be somebody else 

144.59 145.02 A: right 

148.03 150.83 A: yeah i mean but it's true i mean it's something that 

151.52 153.03 A: i mean saddam has been like making 

153.77 154.93 A: both the united nations and 

155.58 157.96 A: the united states look stupid for a long time 

158.45 159.48 A: um i think that's kind of 

159.70 160.25 A: rankled 

160.55 163.65 B: yeah well definitely i mean he should be 

161.45 162.01 A: bush but 

165.02 168.49 B: following you know he lost the war so he should 

169.62 170.18 B: be 

171.37 172.30 B: behaving 

172.35 172.78 A: right 

173.32 173.82 B: but 

174.05 174.52 B: um 

175.56 176.49 B: but i don't know 

178.58 178.90 B: it 

179.95 180.61 B: quite int- 

180.72 181.00 B: thing 

181.54 181.90 A: right 

183.27 185.15 A: but i mean there's in one point i think it 

186.03 188.59 A: i mean you can say saddam is not the last nutcase or whatever but 

189.34 192.07 A: and this might be too optimistic a way of looking at it but you know if we 

192.58 194.13 A: were able to get rid of his regime 

194.72 197.41 A: i i believe it would help the people of iraq because he might 

197.80 199.80 B: uh oh yeah yes i'm 

198.11 198.51 A: you know he's 

198.69 201.27 A: he doesn't i- respect human rights or anything at all so 

200.96 202.66 B: yeah i'm i'm sure yes 

202.76 205.66 B: that that would help um but then 

205.85 207.95 B: eh then would 

208.35 213.52 B: the united states and the u._n. be willing to remain there 

213.67 215.46 B: so long that a 

215.71 224.30 B: change really could be implemented because it takes you know you can you can obliterate the whole country and and if you don't 

224.50 227.33 B: deal with the situation afterwards then 

226.64 227.06 A: right 

228.19 230.74 A: yeah that's what kind of bugs me actually about the timing of this is because 

230.95 231.41 B: yeah 

231.24 232.20 A: it doesn't seem be like we 

232.88 233.35 A: did what we 

233.69 234.41 A: needed to do 

234.53 236.08 A: in afghanistan it's still like 

235.45 237.10 B: exactly yes 

236.32 237.60 A: an ongoing situation 

237.29 240.79 B: and and in a way our i was kind of thinking is is 

240.92 241.92 B: has this been 

242.36 242.89 B: eh well 

243.05 247.61 B: maybe part of that just like a red herring that okay 

248.08 248.87 B: everybody 

249.18 249.88 B: everybody 

250.20 252.43 B: forget that we really i mean 

253.89 260.64 B: u- osama bin ladin is still alive somewhere and and and planning to do whatever and um 

256.26 257.11 A: right yeah 

261.60 264.24 B: and i don't know how much money will support 

264.43 266.52 B: over that operation 

266.67 268.67 B: and it didn't really resolve 

268.91 269.26 A: right 

269.45 270.37 B: the problem 

271.10 271.57 B: so 

271.81 277.82 B: it's kind of like okay because we couldn't get him let's go and get somebody else 

277.65 279.98 A: what's yeah i mean it's sort of like the easy thing to do is 

280.33 281.70 B: is yeah 

280.42 282.46 A: the easy thing for the government to do is just bomb 

282.81 284.42 A: the be jesus out of some country right 

284.66 285.20 B: yeah 

284.68 285.41 A: as opposed to like 

285.74 287.82 A: you know build a nation that's like really hard so 

287.98 289.54 B: uh that's it building the 

288.80 291.07 A: to make it look like there's results or whatever you know 

290.71 296.30 B: right building the nation i was i was reading somewhere that what uh was done 

291.20 291.73 A: (( )) 

296.89 297.97 B: in um 

299.12 300.16 B: in the post 

300.40 302.08 B: second world war 

302.59 304.92 B: japan and germany was 

305.52 306.59 B: kind of like 

307.11 308.73 B: what should be done 

308.84 309.15 B: but 

310.25 312.16 B: now again we're talking about 

311.17 311.69 A: right 

313.01 314.19 B: a culture which is 

314.31 322.80 B: so different i mean even form the japanese culture different it's it's it i mean so far removed form what (( we're used to )) 

315.45 315.90 A: yeah 

318.04 318.53 A: right 

322.60 324.26 A: yeah i mean that's that's i've thought of that 

324.49 325.16 A: to like 

325.34 327.01 A: you know we're able to rebuild 

327.43 330.23 A: ha- (( re- europe )) and japan or whatever and i mean 

330.75 332.43 A: i don't know they were at like a higher 

332.80 333.33 A: you know 

333.65 336.91 A: economic level or like had a higher living living standard than like 

337.03 338.23 A: afghanistan so 

337.11 338.06 B: right 

338.53 339.27 B: right 

338.71 339.32 A: maybe they were 

339.39 340.06 B: oh yeah 

339.44 342.10 A: you know accustomed to like living that way or something but 

342.57 344.83 A: i mean could we expect afghan- afghanistan to become 

342.66 343.34 B: right 

345.54 346.40 A: you know 

346.76 347.45 B: uh oh 

346.79 348.87 A: like us or whatever it seems 

348.27 349.75 B: oh yes that's that's it's 

349.90 351.39 B: so far removed 

351.05 351.48 A: right 

351.73 352.15 B: from 

352.73 353.99 B: hm just you know the way of 

354.14 355.05 B: thinking is 

355.16 355.50 B: so 

355.31 355.65 A: right 

356.35 356.81 B: so dif- 

357.51 358.56 B: it's it's a it 

358.85 359.29 B: it's a 

359.73 360.96 B: very problematic 

361.40 362.96 B: issue um 

363.51 364.62 B: there's there's a lot of 

365.08 365.47 B: um 

365.99 369.17 B: hostility or you know angriness towards 

369.27 371.27 B: bush over this

414.12 414.78 B: here it

426.60 428.02 B: you know so that i would have to 

428.35 437.37 B: start defending george bush (( )) which as alien thought but it's also annoying when people are just criticizing

437.60 438.05 A: right 

437.68 439.46 B: yeah

449.91 450.46 A: okay 

452.39 454.77 A: so i've just wo- i was just wondering like how you felt about like 

452.50 453.15 B: but yeah 

454.96 457.92 A: whether you felt like personally attacked by that or i mean if you can 

458.36 459.62 B: personally well 

458.98 461.01 A: if you felt like justified in like 

461.40 464.00 A: getting revenge or whatever you know after that happened 

462.91 468.36 B: um i eh i don't know i'm i kind of don't believe in revenge 

468.07 468.45 A: uh-huh 

468.95 469.31 B: but 

469.54 470.91 B: um but that was 

471.04 473.46 B: such a horrible horrible thing to happen 

473.93 474.23 B: that 

474.79 475.57 B: of course you 

475.99 476.38 B: don't just 

476.80 478.59 B: keel over and say okay 

479.01 483.92 B: you know turn the other cheek so yeah i i i just 

480.68 481.77 A: right 

485.43 485.84 B: i just 

486.50 487.71 B: one would think that 

489.23 489.68 B: that 

490.16 490.43 B: with 

490.70 494.40 B: all the resources that they have it would be possible to 

494.76 495.30 B: to have 

496.19 496.77 B: actually 

498.71 500.10 B: they would have been able to get 

500.78 502.21 B: bin laden but i don't know 

503.40 504.65 A: yeah i mean 

505.00 506.08 A: i still wonder about that 

507.08 507.73 A: but uh 

508.88 509.60 B: yeah it eh 

509.23 511.89 A: right i mean they claimed they claimed a while back that they had a tape 

512.14 512.51 A: um 

513.21 515.54 A: of bin ladin saying whatever about iraq 

515.69 516.04 A: um 

516.77 520.28 A: and or they thought that that it was him but i wa- i was kind of skeptical about that 

520.25 522.99 B: eh w- yeah it could be propaganda as well 

522.53 524.65 A: right that what i was kind of thinking that they might just 

524.01 524.89 B: right 

524.94 525.58 A: be trying to get a 

533.12 535.62 B: so (( )) where are you in ohio
