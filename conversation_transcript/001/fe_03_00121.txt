94.51 96.82 A: (( [lipsmack] well i i ah )) 

98.61 100.49 A: i really don't think um 

101.09 112.23 A: ah george bush can lose at this point i mean you know even if even if saddam hussein outsmarts him and ah finds a way to get keep world opinion from ah 

112.25 113.19 A: you know 

113.62 114.77 A: (( [lipsmack] ah )) 

115.33 130.16 A: giving us permission to ah to to disarm him um you know like if they come up and they they say they have nothing the inspectors can't find anything i think they got him pretty well pinned down anyway i don't think he can make any really bad moves without everybody really looking at him and going ugh you know you know 

129.96 130.93 A: what i mean 

131.22 132.16 A: it's like 

131.55 133.35 B: yeah i mean i think 

132.55 141.25 A: you know if he if he reaches and and and attacks anybody then there'll be you know everybo- it's all re- really well 

141.64 148.40 A: you know exposed that he's a bad guy and ah you know then we'll say all right let him have it [laughter] 

148.29 151.10 B: yeah it's all pretty carefully orchestrated right 

150.80 153.48 A: yeah but i don't know he s- he seems 

153.52 164.97 A: you know that that they all surprise me i mean bush surprises me sometimes that ah you know he seems he's sort of like colombo you know he talks kind of he sounds kind of dumb but he's but he's really pretty shrewd 

165.69 167.28 A: (( but there's ah )) 

166.07 168.53 B: yeah i think he's manipulative [laughter] 

168.01 169.82 A: yeah right 

169.46 171.71 B: i think this is all you know 

172.09 172.91 B: he's 

173.00 184.01 B: he is shrewd in the way right that he i think he's hell bent on going to war and he's figured out a way that he can you're right no matter what happens he can go to war and nobody's going to 

177.85 179.32 A: yeah 

185.24 188.85 B: [sigh] be able to say you know that shouldn't have 

188.89 192.75 B: he didn't base his you know he didn't rationalize his decision 

192.92 203.29 A: yeah i think i don't think there's really a need to go to war at this point like i say i think they've got him boxed got saddam hussein boxed in h- h- he can't you know he can't 

203.26 204.89 A: he could do something 

204.69 208.32 A: covert but you know if it's ever traced back to him then 

208.14 222.35 A: ever- everyone will just agree to let him have it but i i i'm concerned now that that bush is going to make a move just to save face you know it's like well they can't do that to us you know i know they have em in there we're going to go in and find em and that's what worries me i think that would be really 

211.19 211.90 B: (( do you )) 

221.21 221.93 B: (( no )) 

222.46 223.27 A: (( really )) 

222.51 226.03 B: so you don't think it's going to be resolved without without a war 

225.84 227.16 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

227.73 228.74 B: or you do 

229.37 243.00 A: [mn] well let's see i don't think the inspectors are going to find much and i think bush is going to pissed [laughter] and then i don't know what's going to happen i hope he doesn't go to war but but ah he'll sure want to and ah 

235.95 237.07 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

243.03 247.72 A: so ah i- i'm very concerned and and and i'd be disappointed if we did i think 

247.77 256.73 A: i think if if the inspectors don't find anything they should just bush should just lay back and say oh well i'll find find something else important to go you know 

256.89 261.58 A: ah to go holler about like the economy or something like that 

261.02 274.91 B: yeah no they were talking on on on the news this morning they were saying you know we've got a republican you know we've got a republican house republican senate you know and how is this going to affect domestic policy now and the interviewer was saying 

275.14 279.60 B: what domestic policy [laughter] you know we're we're focusing so much on 

279.87 287.92 B: what's happening in iraq we're focusing on you know hunting out terrorists i mean are we really going to focus any attention on 

288.10 290.66 B: on domestic issues and i really think that 

291.06 292.60 B: we should you know 

291.91 293.01 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

293.37 297.12 A: ah i think we're getting ourselves a bad name in the world too 

297.09 298.26 B: (( absolutely )) 

297.34 300.36 A: th- there was there was something on um 

300.66 303.15 A: [lipsmack] in the newspaper the philly newspaper 

303.16 317.19 A: t- this morning tha- that ah it was just talking about how how bad we're looked upon by all the european countries and stuff as just being you know we make all the weapons and you know 

313.61 314.22 B: (( yeah )) 

317.35 318.53 A: we ah 

318.62 324.73 A: you know we- we're in all the wars and we- we're just ah you know very aggressive 

324.95 330.35 A: war oriented people based on based on external ah you know observation 

330.38 331.36 B: yeah 

330.75 331.53 A: so 

331.80 332.66 A: (( ah )) 

332.05 336.73 B: and it's weird i i find it weird that tony blair is so you know 

336.85 341.07 B: gung ho about jumping on our our bandwagon too 

340.69 342.83 A: yeah i i don't get that either 

342.65 350.56 B: i wish that he were more i i wish that he were portraying himself as a little bit distant from george bush i don't understand it 

351.03 359.66 A: yeah it makes i- it almost looks like well if you speak english then you're this type of person right so it pu- so it kind of um 

351.20 352.01 B: (( but i )) 

355.85 357.53 B: yeah i 

359.87 363.78 A: [lipsmack] stereotypes all english speaking people [laughter] 

362.83 374.27 B: yeah i mean canada is keeping itself a little bit out of it but i guess i was talking to some of my european classmates and they were saying that they think that blair is trying to distance himself from 

367.17 368.15 A: (( that's true )) 

374.80 376.15 B: some of the 

376.66 386.69 B: some of the anti-immigrant sentiment that's been kind of going around in um in france and is kind of being articulated in some other countries ah like in 

386.86 390.74 B: different elections that just were happening in austria and stuff there's some some 

391.11 394.92 B: anti-immigrant sentiment that's that's kind of 

394.94 396.28 B: becoming 

397.42 402.35 B: you know public discourse in in some of these countries and that he thinks by 

402.77 409.70 B: maybe by by showing himself to be affiliated with the u._s. he's trying to distance himself from that 

409.29 410.56 A: (( mhm )) 

411.19 419.12 B: which could be but i think it's a strange way to show [laughter] that you've got you know open mindedness by rushing off to 

416.15 417.13 A: yeah 

419.81 421.00 B: (( to um )) 

421.52 423.39 B: be aggressors you know

478.11 480.84 A: yeah so you doing any research 

481.40 488.74 B: yeah right now i'm doing ah the kind of research that i'm doing is more um about story telling narratives 

487.26 488.13 A: oh neat 

488.78 492.25 B: so ah the kind of data that i'm getting are just you know 

492.59 493.54 B: um 

493.93 498.40 B: narratives of personal experience and kind of analyzing those right now 

498.17 498.94 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

499.62 512.13 B: and um also a little bit of um some tactic variation type analysis looking at ah different communities one particular community in maryland the way that they ah 

513.42 518.59 B: their you know regional variety of english uses some 

518.73 519.92 B: interesting 

520.73 522.63 A: [lipsmack] is that like a rural community 

522.59 527.25 B: yup they're um an island community actually off the coast of maryland 

523.03 523.80 A: yeah 

527.24 528.21 A: oh really 

528.22 529.42 B: yeah 

528.45 529.15 A: (( oh )) 

530.50 533.33 B: so when you do speech recognition you do 

534.40 542.65 B: um are you working with a with a specific company you said that that has voice recognition software 

541.53 554.95 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] yeah we um [lipsmack] we use s- s- some of the major companies and like nuance and speechworks you've heard of them yeah and then um we write the applications that um telephone companies use 

548.37 549.31 B: mhm 

554.79 565.29 A: for ah voice mail and and getting like content off the web and stuff like that through their telephones 'cause the phone companies are really they're they're hurting for um 

565.46 569.01 A: for finding ways to um make ah their 

569.38 573.02 A: mobile providers their mobile customers spend their money 

573.09 574.04 B: (( mhm )) 

573.10 575.61 A: [mn] so um they're trying to find 

575.90 578.60 A: s- you know glitzy things to ah 

578.72 582.20 A: that ah that users might want like um 

582.34 595.90 A: you know automatic ah subscriptions to traffic reports on roads they travel and we're just trying to dream up tec- technical solutions to [sigh] that stuff so you know but then um 

593.02 593.92 B: wow 

596.52 598.59 A: [lipsmack] people are using ah 

598.93 609.57 A: you know the- they want to they want the user interface to be speech recognition because a lot of people are are using their phones you know walking around with the microphones and all that stuff the headsets and that kind of thing 

609.37 613.25 B: so the idea would be the cell phone caller could just say to 

613.35 617.30 B: you know whatever software i want to know about traffic 

615.32 616.23 A: yeah 

616.69 630.61 A: yeah read my email you know traffic report and it says well you know what what city philadelphia you know what road you know i seventy six east bound or west bound east bound you know 

630.94 638.73 A: um you know that kind of thing well there's a blockage on you know near exit twenty two or something like that it reads it to ya you know [mn] 

637.90 638.94 B: (( so your )) 

639.02 650.15 B: your company would also be trying to figure out like ways to to take like maybe a ah a traffic report and figuring out ways to pass it and 

650.48 654.07 A: no- not that so much as trying to guess what the what the humans are going to say 

653.65 654.99 B: (( right i see i see )) 

654.16 658.01 A: you know and try to try to let them speak naturally and ask for things 

657.99 671.67 A: like some of our applications get pretty complex and but ah capturing um letting people say a whole ah like the airline reservation you know i want to fly from philadelphia to chicago 

671.72 673.44 A: uh tomorrow 

673.76 674.85 A: december 

675.12 676.15 A: (( ah )) 

676.60 677.65 A: tenth 

677.96 689.00 A: ah and then and then let you say as much of it as as you want and then having it come back and ask you for the rest say well what time do you want to leave you didn't say that [laughter] or if you said 

678.11 679.37 B: yeah 

688.05 691.66 B: (( i've got to tell you i don't like do you know the one on american airlines )) 

691.72 695.85 A: yeah yeah there's a lot there's a whole number of them out there 

695.80 698.92 B: american airlines one makes me angry [laughter] 

698.27 700.64 A: (( yeah that )) 

699.04 701.05 B: [laughter] i really hate that one 

701.32 702.38 A: um 

702.99 705.40 A: [lipsmack] a lot of em are really bad 

705.06 706.31 B: yeah 

705.75 715.13 A: ah but some of em are you know the- they- they're getting better people are learning more about you know the human factor so and you know how to how to um 

715.30 719.89 A: how to bou- pe- how to how to give prompts that's a big part of it too how to give prompts so that peop
