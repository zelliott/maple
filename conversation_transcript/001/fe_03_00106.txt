0.66 3.13 A: hello this is susan 

2.82 11.70 B: hello this is ricky calling y- ah we're talking about ah u._s. policy in iraq i believe 

11.38 13.97 A: yes as regards to arms control 

13.60 17.86 B: as to what what should what the united states should do 

19.18 20.26 B: (( and ah )) 

20.79 24.81 B: i don't know i i have ah strong feelings about it i don't know if you do 

25.50 28.11 A: ah i think they should 

28.48 30.74 A: do inspections for arms 

30.77 31.76 A: to 

32.40 36.35 A: give iraq every chance to do the right thing 

37.04 39.65 A: and hopefully avert war 

42.01 43.03 A: (( [mn] um )) 

42.83 43.88 B: uh-huh 

48.05 49.48 A: [mn] i'm 

49.76 51.61 A: wondering if ah 

52.39 55.41 A: the inspectors would be able to find 

56.83 57.95 A: weapons 

58.66 63.23 A: of mass destruction for fear that they've been hidden too well [noise] 

63.62 64.65 B: right 

63.80 66.58 A: and they won't be findable [mn] 

67.95 70.72 A: but still i think the attempt should be made 

71.72 73.85 B: (( yes i i agree ah i )) 

74.18 75.89 B: think we do need to 

75.90 83.06 B: look very carefully they've got some intelligence information of various kinds or they say they do 

83.36 95.54 B: and i think that that's important i'm i'm just not absolutely sure about the prioritization of iraq over terrorism and afghanistan in general 

95.66 105.09 B: it seems it came up rather suddenly when we really haven't dealt with the other terrorist aspects of the situation 

105.59 118.25 B: it seemed to me that iraq was unlikely to attack anyone at that point 'cause it would mean suicide and we did ah we face a lot of danger i think from these ah 

118.40 122.88 B: these various terrorist organizations al qaeda especially 

124.23 129.24 B: you know the question is that what happens if ah we're not successful in finding them 

129.72 134.28 B: and what are the what are the sort of costs of the war [mn] 

134.29 135.46 B: i think the 

135.93 141.69 B: public need to be sort of better informed on the cost of the war they fired ah 

141.86 151.88 B: the economics advisor for sa- essentially for saying that it might cost two i think it was two trillion dollars or some some 

152.92 156.57 B: some huge amount anyway for ah 

157.11 161.63 B: for saying that publicly although they'd been saying it privately 

161.92 172.54 B: and it seems that so there need to be there will need to be a number of sacrifices that ah we will have to make in order to be able to afford this 

173.56 177.35 B: so that's ah one issue that that i'm concerned with 

178.02 188.18 B: it seems seems to me that the economy is really in a not very good shape it seems to be getting worse from what i read about the unemployment this morning 

188.77 195.66 B: so that i'm not sure that i i'd like to see so much emphasis on iraq 

195.83 201.72 B: while our economy and the fate of the forests are sort of getting worse and 

202.25 203.57 A: (( [lipsmack] it's )) 

202.53 204.73 B: i- yeah go ahead 

203.98 211.00 A: is ah it is possible that there is intelligence that can't be made public that 

211.31 212.22 A: (( ah )) 

212.81 215.13 A: iraq is closer to 

217.10 219.48 A: doing something reckless 

219.64 222.57 A: than the general public knows about 

223.72 224.70 B: yeah 

223.95 224.90 A: um 

225.19 229.47 A: i agree that the war would be very costly 

229.73 232.29 A: perhaps unbearably costly 

233.48 234.39 A: um 

236.17 238.51 B: it seems that we're doing spending a lot of 

236.31 237.74 A: yet [noise] [mn] 

239.11 251.26 B: w- we're cutting taxes especially on the higher income brackets and sort of spending money that inva- spending money fairly wildly on defense 

251.60 262.59 B: which you know which may be needed but we're also at the same time trying to let everyone have their cake and eat it i guess ex- except for those programs that are being cut 

263.09 265.51 B: at the lower le- income levels 

266.56 276.93 B: i don't know the the whole business of ah you know th- these people probably know something that ah w- we don't but which they can't make public 

277.35 280.43 B: is a is a sort of way of ah 

281.96 288.12 B: really getting to do whatever it is you want ah and frustrating democracy 

288.46 293.49 B: if you say well we can't tell you what it is but we can tell you that this is what we have to do 

293.53 297.13 B: now sometimes i agree that it's sometimes necessary to 

297.53 300.52 B: do that but ah i'm not sure that i 

300.56 304.31 B: trust our government at this at this sta- 

305.01 309.71 B: stage to to do that and then the question is whether the other 

309.83 313.72 B: powers on the security council really are aware of 

314.55 325.76 B: of this kind of information whether britain and ah france and so forth have been briefed on it and understand the need and apparently ah 

326.14 331.11 B: many of them don't seem to be aware of that that same situation 

331.70 334.62 B: so in a way saying okay 

334.68 340.41 B: you probably have some secret information so we give you essentially a blank check 

340.68 343.06 B: (( seems very dangerous )) 

348.71 352.11 A: yes i have to agree with that 

348.87 350.03 B: uh maybe 

352.74 355.82 B: yeah it's it's a difficult situation isn't it 

352.92 353.76 A: um 

357.66 361.67 A: [lipsmack] it's very difficult for me to make up my mind with any certainty 

363.92 367.02 B: yeah because we don't have all the facts 

367.10 368.53 B: (( and ah )) 

368.98 373.76 B: you know i i we don't know if the administration has all the facts either we're 

374.07 375.26 A: that is true 

374.11 389.01 B: going to see see what they ah do with all these reports they're getting them translated they weren't too successful in the past in getting things translated they ran short of translators apparently 

389.18 394.80 B: that was one of the things that led them to ignore the warnings about the september the eleventh 

395.26 398.85 B: and they didn't get to translate the warnings until afterwards 

395.70 397.39 A: [noise] that is true [mn] 

398.91 406.26 B: then they fired the [mn] group of ah arab arabic trained ah translators because they were gay 

406.30 407.86 B: apparently 

407.29 408.34 A: oh they did 

408.30 413.82 B: yes they fired ah at least seven of them i think from ah monterey 

413.98 416.54 B: because they found out that they were gay 

416.84 422.70 B: and it seems that being gay is more serious than ah this crisis in iraq 

422.99 430.31 B: if that's the one area that we really need it it just seems that the priorities are sort of not being set out straight 

434.09 440.41 B: so it's a little the whole thing is a little scary if we get sort of pushed into a war that's g- that's 

440.43 444.19 B: gonna co- be very very costly because it will affect our 

444.20 447.26 B: could affect our standard of living seriously 

447.78 449.16 B: (( and ah )) 

450.03 457.00 B: it seems to be because we've got some very hawk like people in the administration 

457.12 461.16 B: who are more successful at persuading the president than 

461.45 463.58 B: powell and others who are 

464.00 468.18 B: somewhat more cautious about the rushing into things 

468.65 474.64 A: [mn] if um there is a strike against iraq do you worry about retaliation 

475.33 476.14 B: (( uh )) 

476.27 478.42 B: yes i do because 

479.10 481.13 B: [mn] i mean imagine that you're 

481.18 488.04 B: a a tyrant a sadistic tyrant in iraq and you you have some germ weapons or whatever it is 

488.25 494.08 B: you may not want to use them because ah the retaliation would be so ah severe 

494.42 502.48 B: that ah you'd be committing suicide but on the other hand if you're attacked and they're going to kill you anyway 

502.71 506.26 B: that's the time when you you use anything you've got 

507.00 512.10 B: and ah that's a little scary because that's when you reach o 

512.40 523.58 B: the a country like that may reach out to various terrorist groups and say look ah we may not agree on everything but we're all muslim and ah 

523.72 536.25 B: we- we'll give you these ah germ weapons or whatever it is and ah you do what you can with them put em on a plane on a plane somewhere or [mn] in someone's baggage [mn] 

536.98 542.27 B: and so forth and ah you know kennedy airport or chica- o'hare 

542.69 554.30 B: and you know the whole prospect is is rather scary i mean it's a situation anyone would be in if if you're life is really threatened you'll use anything you'll ge- you've got right 

555.19 557.78 A: [lipsmack] that's very likely to happen 

558.14 559.07 A: um 

560.29 567.87 B: it's not likely he would use it to initiate a conflict if no one was no one was threatening you 

568.16 569.72 B: you ah you'd prob- 

570.19 582.44 B: you wouldn't even want to to do it even on a neighboring country israel might be an obvious target because the retali- they w- the retaliation prospects will be pretty straightforward 

583.64 584.53 A: um 

584.85 585.97 A: still 

586.13 593.93 A: using biologicals on a nearby country could be dangerous because the disease could spread 

594.28 596.34 A: in unpredictable ways 

596.45 601.12 A: not necessarily rapidly but in ways that we can't predict or expect 

601.60 605.38 B: it could very easily i i'm think- imagine if someone 

606.62 608.49 B: (( a suicide type )) 

608.54 610.04 B: carrying ah 

610.10 611.88 B: simply some microbes 

612.85 615.34 B: and ah flying to new york 

615.88 623.60 B: and he could get through all the security systems i would think with there isn't a system for detecting microbes as far as i know 

624.06 625.99 A: no not to my knowledge 

624.55 627.44 B: a- and then ah simply 

627.72 630.67 B: dump them in ah the water supply 

632.02 635.42 A: [lipsmack] or walking all around town sneezing everywhere [laughter] [lipsmack] [lipsmack] 

635.92 641.40 B: yeah well that would be a lesser [laughter] that could also work 

641.55 651.49 B: assuming that it could spread but those things are are not that hard to e- envisage and very hard to prevent 

652.31 656.31 B: we've been walking into this kind of situation for a while 

659.56 661.59 B: it seems that it's hard to 

662.78 667.61 B: because we've taken such a strong position protecting israel 

668.12 681.11 B: and i think israel is a country that's worth protecting in a sense but we've taken such a strong to the major disadvantage to the arabs that the a lot of people in the muslim world all over the place are sympathetic 

681.18 684.90 B: even though th- they may not care for ah saddam 

690.29 694.13 A: i feel that democracy needs to be protected 

694.92 696.47 A: much as 

697.05 703.49 A: it needed to be protected in the nineteen thirties in europe and around the world 

702.90 703.87 B: (( yes [noise] )) 

704.39 705.27 A: (( ah )) 

706.05 707.88 A: we may be out of time 

709.57 710.71 B: yeah that's ah 

711.33 716.54 B: wh- what do you mean by it should be protected ah were you thinking of a particular situation 

717.01 719.89 A: i've been reading about world war two history
