52.99 61.93 A: it's it's it's an ugly see unfortunate it's that's that's a great word to (( )) on the problem is is that they've got one tenth of the population so it's much easier to implement 

62.26 63.18 B: oh i see 

63.29 66.16 A: if you started during that from square one down here 

66.90 69.13 A: well the pharmaceutical companies would go crazy 

70.01 70.40 B: right 

71.11 75.65 B: that's so i mean everyone has access to health care that i just hear that there's sometimes like long lines 

76.47 78.23 B: for certain procedures or whatever 

78.09 80.07 A: well let's just say when you have asthma 

80.87 81.27 B: uh-huh 

81.25 85.34 A: you get used to the idea that the line forms uh around need 

85.79 86.35 B: okay 

91.62 95.99 A: their bleeding from an automobile accident or whatnot i can understand why uh 

96.69 99.73 A: the doctor may be a little more interested in them but if uh 

99.99 107.04 A: i've seen too many times when my wife has gone in after a bee sting and they not only had her they had (( )) literally standing there with the defibrillator 

108.53 108.89 B: mmm 

108.83 110.70 A: so i'm not going to 

110.94 112.94 A: say a word against it 

114.05 119.12 A: there's just you know too much benefit to outweigh any of the the minor inconveniences 

120.84 121.75 B: how good for you 

122.81 130.68 A: but uh no i'm i i kind of wan- been thinking in the long run not just about iraq but about most of our foreign policy 

131.79 134.84 A: and tragically we have an annoying problem in this country 

136.24 136.59 B: okay 

136.81 140.00 A: and that is we think the rest of the world is just like us 

143.11 143.98 A: yeah (( )) 

143.27 149.64 B: i would i would agree with that well i think most people their point of reference is usually what goes on around them what they know and experience 

144.71 145.03 A: (( )) 

149.82 151.72 A: mhm i mean most people think 

152.05 153.45 A: most people around the world 

153.59 155.15 A: get their view of the united states 

155.29 156.22 A: through c._n._n. 

156.58 157.01 B: hmm 

157.49 160.69 A: so they think that america is one gigantic suburb of atlanta 

162.67 163.57 A: and that's scary 

164.04 164.43 B: uh-huh 

164.56 167.75 A: it's the tiny things things we wouldn't even notice 

168.87 170.09 A: you watch a sitcom 

170.81 171.90 A: and in half an hour 

172.11 175.13 A: people are eating at the dinner table four times 

177.61 178.07 A: i mean 

178.46 180.23 A: i hate to say this but uh 

180.55 182.17 A: that's a different kind of gluttony 

182.28 183.75 A: one that we don't even notice 

187.14 193.40 B: so i mean in reference to our foreign policy you think that we're we're out there trying to convert people to be like us or 

193.41 197.89 A: the problem is we don't rea- we don't realize how different things are 

193.93 194.89 B: we're trying to impose 

198.29 200.66 A: well worse when we do make an effort 

202.05 204.54 A: i mean all the problems in the middle east 

204.97 207.33 A: stem from the simple fact that they don't 

207.50 207.93 A: have 

208.12 209.73 A: governments like we do 

211.66 215.15 A: that there are whole traditions and whatnot in our culture 

216.32 219.87 A: that just don't make their way into these other places 

222.38 224.25 A: and when we try to do it 

225.24 229.72 A: i mean israel is technically speaking historically a very young country 

230.25 230.57 B: right 

230.81 232.52 A: but from the very start of it 

232.63 234.51 A: they were trying to run people out of it 

235.06 235.33 B: right 

235.53 238.64 A: you know this is my land god gave my land to me 

239.22 240.24 B: right 

239.85 243.81 A: they were out pushing israel bonds i kept wondering where are the palestine bonds 

244.66 247.38 A: if you're going to live on the same land with these people 

247.68 253.61 A: then you'd better be prepared to have an economy and a political system that works for everybody 

254.42 254.87 A: because 

255.64 258.81 A: if you go up to a sixteen year old kid and tell him 

259.27 259.62 A: that the 

259.73 268.01 A: best thing he can do for himself for his family and for his people is to strap a dynamite bomb on himself and go down and visit the mall 

268.58 268.97 B: hmm 

269.07 278.60 A: i'd love to be in a world where that kid turns around and says screw you you old fart i've got a job i've got a date i've got a life 

279.10 283.91 A: i got something better to do than break rocks up and throw them at the cops 

288.24 294.96 A: and the problem is is that you sit there and you stop and you look at that and you say how true is that for some place else in the world 

295.85 296.35 B: right 

297.10 301.14 A: what worries me is at what point are those idiots going to start convincing people here 

305.29 309.06 B: i'd say seems like a lot of it is about money i think and about oil 

309.69 319.85 A: well of course that's tragically that's probably all that these people in the higher echelons of power give a damn about keeping everything running exactly the way it is now 

322.33 323.27 A: but uh 

333.17 335.55 A: big hero in life is joseph stalin 

337.90 341.67 A: i mean if joseph stalin had money he'd be saddam hussein 

345.79 348.38 B: so that money corrupts absolutely is that it 

347.73 348.32 A: definitely 

348.85 353.96 A: definitely and the arabs are all sitting there wondering if we're going to go in and treat him like this 

354.60 356.32 A: how long before there next 

356.65 357.64 B: exactly yeah 

358.04 360.95 A: we don't have anybody we can point to and say 

361.08 362.93 A: here's somebody who came to america 

364.56 369.39 A: who's learned how stuff works who's learned how to basically 

369.56 370.23 A: divert 

370.38 375.03 A: the power away from the upper crust and the and the big corporations 

375.25 378.09 A: and put it in the hands of the people and the law 

378.89 387.59 A: and unfortunately the problem is is that every time they do this the oil companies have somebody they can go out and hire because have you ever noticed every place where the terrorists are 

387.70 388.88 A: the oil companies are 

389.26 389.65 B: mhm 

391.31 394.68 A: and gee they never get around to blowing up those pipelines 

395.51 399.13 A: they'll blow up children's hospitals before they blow up a refinery 

409.08 412.48 A: put what they consider to be a safe person in power 

413.21 414.17 A: look who they put 

415.57 416.32 A: the shah 

417.27 418.08 A: idi amin 

421.63 425.60 B: i'm not too familiar with those guys i just know their names 

426.54 428.67 A: let's just say we've got a dreadful record 

430.18 432.60 B: of successfully converting people to a democracy 

433.64 438.81 A: you know it's unfortunately uh that's the case we'd rather have monsters we know 

439.22 440.96 A: monsters who at least trust us 

439.37 439.78 B: the dev- 

441.65 444.04 B: the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know 

444.51 449.92 A: yeah but the problem is now the devil are banging little pieces of plutonium and anthrax together 

450.55 452.04 B: right 

451.61 452.55 A: and uh 

452.90 453.24 A: hey 

453.81 455.25 A: who trained osama 

455.97 456.43 B: right 

457.21 458.11 A: in the long run 

458.41 460.74 A: it's our own problems coming home to roost 

462.86 464.99 B: well especially when they're shooting our own missiles back at us 

465.50 465.89 A: yeah 

466.18 472.62 A: i mean that's the joke of it uh i mean you know where did where did they buy all these uh you know where did they get all these uniforms in iraq 

473.16 476.00 A: they bought them second hand from the ur- the romanian army 

476.80 477.92 A: you know who sold them to them 

478.98 479.80 B: americans 

479.86 480.75 A: friends of nixon 

483.52 484.48 A: it's a joke 

484.74 485.72 A: it's a tragic 

486.05 488.82 A: stupid joke because you start playing with these things 

489.60 490.40 A: keep assuming 

490.64 498.15 A: everything is controllable that everybody will do exactly what you want them to do and the world just doesn't work like that 

499.63 502.01 A: and because you need to put gas in your car 

502.43 503.75 A: we have to have a war 

504.45 505.62 A: oh my attitude is 

506.00 508.19 A: why are we still burning oil 

509.00 512.32 A: we had an energy crisis thirty five years ago 

514.27 515.57 A: where's our alternatives 

515.69 525.41 A: what's changed i'll tell you what's changed we don't have cars anymore we have s._u._v.'s they get the same shitty mileage as a nineteen seventy four car 

525.72 526.03 B: hmm 

527.31 529.48 A: but because they're a truck 

530.92 532.41 A: they're magically not the same 

532.63 538.44 A: if we're going to play games like that and say that black is white and red is green then uh 

539.47 540.32 A: we're bound to make 

540.85 543.70 A: a lot of problems when we try to drag this in to other cultures 

544.76 549.42 A: because they're going to look at us and say hey when are you when are you (( )) good is bad you know 

550.39 557.14 A: these people are ali- these people are a rogue nation but these people are a safer nation and they're all doing exactly the same thing 

560.91 563.59 A: politics is just too damn dangerous
