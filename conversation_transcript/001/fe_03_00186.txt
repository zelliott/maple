4.38 5.69 A: hi nina 

5.08 7.37 B: hi nice to meet you over the phone 

7.16 8.25 A: yeah 

7.84 14.72 B: i'm just changing phones so i can hear a little bit better now did you hear the question again it was if you could 

13.85 15.92 A: it was about holidays wasn't it 

15.11 18.71 B: if you could create a holiday and then who would be involved 

19.44 22.25 A: right do you have any idea about that 

22.25 24.56 B: where where do you live 

24.46 28.41 A: i live in columbus ohio but i'm british as you can probably hear 

28.16 33.56 B: uh-huh yeah actually i'm from ohio too but i live in oregon i go to portland state 

32.97 35.85 A: right well your voice sounds really familiar then [laughter] 

35.51 38.11 B: okay well that's where that's a good thing 

36.43 37.21 A: yeah 

38.28 40.59 B: well let's see um 

40.88 43.73 B: if i could create a holiday 

44.24 46.93 B: i think i would 

47.54 49.41 B: let's see well what do you think 

49.21 58.06 A: yeah well i don't know i i like i've i've just experienced u._s. thanksgiving properly for the first time and i like that because it's 

54.28 56.09 B: oh yeah 

57.95 69.46 A: like british christmas but it doesn't have presents and it's not so commercial you know it seems to be about about about family and i like the eating 

59.85 60.82 B: uh-huh 

65.01 67.77 B: yeah yeah well the original 

68.52 69.45 B: right 

69.82 75.11 B: well the original idea behind thanksgiving is a really great one though too you know the whole story right 

73.25 74.05 A: yeah 

74.40 76.02 A: (( yeah )) 

75.19 75.96 B: (( uh-huh )) 

76.06 87.12 B: yeah i see that's what i like about holidays is that they really if they have a whole story then i think that that's what's more uh meaningful rather than just kinda making something up 

87.08 88.76 A: yeah 

88.37 93.69 B: so i i actually would have to say there must have to be some really interesting reason to make up a holiday 

93.71 95.15 B: i don't see 

95.21 96.97 B: the point of doing it 

95.38 96.10 A: yeah 

97.13 102.65 A: yeah well i guess the last one was martin luther king and i can kind of i definitely see the point of that 

102.23 114.07 B: oh yeah no exactly yeah i would definitely agree with that and that's what i was thinking too martin luther king but i mean like that's yeah i guess that's a like a holiday that you celebrate rather than just like having like a meal or 

113.64 114.81 A: yeah 

114.18 115.60 B: some other reason 

115.20 117.89 A: so we've got to think up something that good right 

117.28 120.52 B: okay yeah yeah i agree [laughter] 

119.11 121.33 A: [laughter] tough 

121.43 126.87 B: ah well i was actually going to have to say um international women's day that's what i would say 

126.62 128.22 A: is that not a holiday 

128.29 132.91 B: i think that no i think it's like women's month though isn't it 

128.30 130.34 A: it is some places i think 

132.64 133.82 A: yeah 

133.20 135.26 B: i think it's like you know march 

135.18 136.30 A: yeah 

135.70 142.19 B: but i think if we had a specific day just like you said like the importance of having martin luther king be remembered every year 

141.23 145.42 A: [noise] right well which what would you like to happen 

142.50 143.75 B: i think that that 

145.68 157.35 B: well i think that people should really look at women as being an important part of the world i i don't think in a lot of different places even here in the united states or even in england that women are recognized as much as they should be 

156.96 163.41 A: [noise] no i'm sure that's true but i guess men could say the same thing we're not recognized as much as we should be either 

162.75 165.11 B: (( well then i think there should be a men's day )) 

164.51 165.92 A: yeah 

165.61 174.11 B: sure i think there should be a men's and and a women's day and and people should make more of an effort i think to recognize the importance of the sexes 

165.99 167.76 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

174.40 177.44 B: and not just of your sex necessarily but i mean 

177.34 189.93 B: of the importance of of whatever differences that there are doesn't mean that you have to change them just because of one or the other but the necessarily uh importance of having equality i think that's important 

189.81 190.97 A: (( yeah )) 

190.44 192.19 B: equality and respect 

191.50 202.67 A: yeah i wonder what people would do i mean the tradition th- there are there are quite i'm i'm very conscious of the traditions because the american holidays are mostly new to us so we don't really know what's 

202.70 206.18 A: what's gonna happen my my son is just getting me to sign something 

205.95 207.12 B: (( oh okay )) 

207.02 213.08 A: [laughter] no he's showing me something okay is it anything to do with holidays jamie because we've got to think of what's a good holiday 

213.20 217.17 A: okay sorry third participant doesn't count yeah 

215.27 216.34 B: sure 

217.78 220.81 A: yeah um and have you 

221.65 226.28 A: have you had any holidays that you've really enjoyed more than you expected 

226.33 232.78 B: well let's see i would have to say easter when i was really little and that's probably because 

226.50 227.68 A: (( with holidays )) 

233.36 242.38 B: i got to get dressed up and be with my sister and brother and then my mom would have us look for easter baskets that she'd hide really early in the morning 

242.61 244.32 A: (( yeah )) 

243.22 246.57 B: so something that kind of involves mystery and fun 

247.07 248.41 A: yes 

248.54 251.33 A: (( yes that's that's magic isn't it )) 

252.17 255.45 B: so do we just kind of like talk until we're done or 

255.03 257.64 A: (( i don't know [laughter] i have no idea )) 

256.79 258.99 B: is this the first time you're doing the study 

258.64 260.35 A: first time i've done this yeah 

259.75 261.14 B: yeah yeah me too 

261.28 262.83 B: i just signed up today 

263.94 267.21 B: [mn] but it's sort of what people would be involved so 

268.10 275.51 B: well i guess we could just make up another one um let's see and i think this is for analyzing linguistics right 

275.36 278.43 A: i think so but i've i think we're supposed to act natural 

278.38 279.61 B: (( yeah right [mn] )) 

279.74 281.82 A: (( um which is not )) 

280.80 285.88 B: but i mean like i'm trying to enunciate though too not instead of just kind of mumbling into the phone 

285.64 287.60 A: oh yeah we do that [laughter] 

287.75 294.25 A: that's all right that i mean we're communicating fine so i think no it must be okay we could have a communication day 

288.70 289.86 B: right right 

292.55 293.35 B: right 

294.61 300.11 B: oh that's a good one or or like a like a languages day 

299.60 308.20 A: hey you know what i'd like i know what i'd like this is just me feeling guilty but i do most of my communication by email nowadays 

300.86 301.57 B: what 

302.10 302.99 B: (( okay mm )) 

307.64 308.65 B: yeah 

308.33 312.73 A: um and i kind of like written letters 

313.11 315.69 B: written letters like a letter day 

315.21 316.39 A: (( yeah we )) 

315.79 317.60 B: that's a great idea 

316.57 318.53 A: could call it a red letter day 

318.40 322.23 B: yeah that's a that's a good one i think that's good 

320.44 321.24 A: yeah 

321.61 323.71 A: and then we'd know what to do wouldn't we 

323.05 331.61 B: but then yeah but then you'd have to have like i said what people would you have involved so who would you have be the spokesperson necessarily 

332.10 335.58 A: oh i don't know i think you could g- i think you could get 

335.90 337.71 A: you know authors 

337.43 338.44 B: right 

337.99 339.77 A: might get to is 

339.29 342.30 B: actually you know what today is emily dickinson's birthday 

342.01 343.32 A: (( it )) 

342.67 347.81 B: yeah and uh when she died she had a whole stack of letters 

348.23 361.07 B: and then a whole 'nother stack of poems and two ribbons in piles for her uh sister and then she told her sister to burn them and the sister burn- did burn the letters but she kept the poems 

353.89 355.05 A: yeah hm 

361.44 364.44 B: so maybe it could be something like um 

364.91 365.79 B: you know 

365.07 367.35 A: burn somebody's letters no i don't think 

366.14 371.76 B: non burn non burn letters day like writing letters to make up for all the different things that 

371.94 374.89 B: that people haven't been doing with written letters before 

374.65 380.44 A: yeah yeah or no junk mail day that would be a good one they had that didn't they 

379.89 381.65 B: john mail day 

381.20 382.49 A: no junk mail 

382.37 384.22 B: no junk mail day 

383.74 384.84 A: yeah 

384.26 385.76 B: oh that's good 

385.15 391.07 A: i think they'd i i i think i heard about that that sort of one of these things they they 

391.24 395.37 A: the people who normally send out junk mail decided not to for a few days 

395.19 403.40 B: but see this is the thing now you you'll laugh because i used to work for a company that um sent out different uh 

404.28 406.41 B: [mn] letters for people to 

406.47 410.10 B: have credit cards and they don't think it's junk mail though you know 

407.81 408.54 A: yeah 

408.98 409.90 A: no 

410.45 411.70 B: so i mean 

411.81 416.09 B: like your junk mail is another person's interesting 

412.51 413.75 A: yeah 

415.55 417.14 A: quite right [laughter] 

416.46 417.44 B: uh 

417.87 430.59 B: uh advertising and so that's why solicitors think that they can figure out who you are and what your tastes are and then they can figure out what stuff y- they think that you would wanna receive in the mail but see i don't i don't like any of that stuff anyway 

418.87 419.82 A: yeah 

430.23 434.27 A: was any of that stuff when you were doing it interesting to do or was it just a job [laughter] 

435.01 439.55 B: oh i was actually editing all the letters just to make sure that they were correct 

440.01 443.46 B: i was uh editing for spelling and grammar and syntax 

442.44 444.13 A: (( oh gawd yeah [laughter] )) 

444.19 446.18 A: get it right but no fun 

446.08 449.26 B: yeah exactly well that's okay 'cause they paid me well so 

446.77 447.55 A: oh 

448.67 450.91 A: well that's good the money's good yeah 

451.02 452.74 A: yeah okay 

452.00 464.37 B: so yeah i think that that would be an excellent holiday letter writing day and then you could have like different categories to suggest for people for the 'cause you know people kind of need more direction like you have to hold 'em by the hand and say okay 

464.48 467.74 B: you know why would you wanna write a letter and to who and then 

468.19 469.90 A: yeah 

469.37 473.80 B: you could say you could write for different causes too 

474.26 477.20 B: or political prisoners to get out of jail 

478.02 480.49 A: (( yeah the u._s. postal service would like that )) 

480.87 481.65 B: who 

481.38 483.32 A: the postal service would like that 

482.66 484.58 B: the postal service yeah 

483.84 486.70 A: (( but it would be a good idea i'm i i like that one )) 

487.18 498.59 B: well i mean even now for example i think the uh post office is still doing an excellent job i mean i know people they have a problem with the u._s. postal service but i know other postal services who are much worse 

499.07 500.24 A: [noise] yeah well [laughter] 

499.44 504.34 B: yeah we could we could put posters up in the in the mailroom if we have our letter day 

505.85 507.32 B: that would be great 

506.10 507.07 A: (( sounds nice )) 

507.40 508.22 A: yeah 

507.56 509.38 B: i think that's that's a good one
