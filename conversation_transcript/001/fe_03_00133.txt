105.13 111.23 A: but don't you find do you find the people in the united states agree with you more or less i find that most of my friends 

111.80 114.70 A: are very are in favor of invading iraq 

115.01 119.57 A: i feel alone sometimes with that feeling with my feeling of not 

117.46 118.09 B: aha

142.81 143.36 B: they 

143.58 149.30 B: i mean i see a split i either see people who are 

149.57 150.02 B: guess 

150.40 153.59 B: the easiest way to call them would be very hawkish about it 

153.65 154.26 A: mhm 

154.41 155.37 B: and 

155.49 156.11 B: uh 

156.66 159.57 B: the people are very against it nothing in the middle 

159.79 160.80 B: um 

163.37 167.32 B: i'm in a unique situation i'm since i am 

167.99 171.21 B: ah resident alien 

171.98 173.68 B: and given the 

173.84 182.24 B: climate i mean the climate of what things have been since september eleventh i actually find that i cannot 

178.60 179.52 A: mhm 

182.44 190.80 B: raise my voice very i mean i feel like i can't raise voice in objection very load i wish i could have gone to that demonstration too 

184.27 184.77 A: mhm 

187.15 187.60 A: mhm 

191.60 192.22 A: it was fun 

192.33 195.73 A: it was really fun it was kind of exciting it was ah 

195.98 198.67 A: the vietnam the anti-vietnam demonstrations 

197.47 198.20 B: mhm 

199.28 201.00 A: really kind of reminiscent of that 

202.09 203.58 A: that's interesting so 

203.79 207.50 A: do you feel that people look at you differently because you a resident alien 

207.89 208.79 B: ah 

209.53 213.85 B: no ah what i think it is ah 

214.73 217.76 B: ah there are certain attitudes i'm saying 

218.40 222.25 B: ah or rather hearing not necessarily 

223.14 230.29 B: if i ah a lot of the people i know directly but i just think there is a certain a greater degree of hostility right now 

230.39 230.94 A: mhm 

232.20 233.74 A: in terms of of of 

234.21 235.50 A: dissident opinions 

235.94 236.54 B: oh yeah 

236.56 237.05 A: yeah 

237.87 238.79 B: am 

238.91 239.50 B: my 

240.23 241.31 B: as i said like 

241.46 242.29 B: because 

242.81 247.87 B: i'm on a very active mailing list and one fellow 

248.41 254.47 B: who disagreed with me about it actually i mean went so far as to say if you don't agree go back home 

254.66 256.40 A: ah isn't that terrible 

257.82 259.16 A: that's really something wa- i'm 

259.44 261.71 A: i get the same thing even though i'm from here 

261.70 262.51 B: mhm 

262.34 264.11 A: i have a friend who have told me if i 

264.60 267.58 A: don't support the united states invasion think about living somewhere else 

267.79 268.67 B: yes 

268.49 268.90 A: so 

269.03 270.05 A: i've i've gotten 

269.17 270.41 B: it's an unfortunate 

270.63 271.77 B: exclusionary 

271.87 272.61 A: mhm 

272.40 279.33 B: type of ah a ah approach that they take i never liked this sort of (( )) type patriotism 

279.53 282.92 A: exactly and it has increased since september eleventh 

283.07 284.60 A: decidedly hasn't it 

286.34 289.50 B: well i know as i said i mean i never liked 

289.61 290.56 B: to 

290.74 291.15 B: my 

291.41 294.77 B: my country is eh my country right or wrong 

293.44 293.99 A: yeah 

294.54 295.18 A: right 

295.18 296.11 B: um 

295.75 298.02 A: love it or leave it 

296.84 298.45 B: yeah ah 

300.05 300.41 B: but 

300.70 301.02 B: it eh 

301.13 305.10 B: it it has to some and it's very unfortunate too 

305.88 307.69 B: ah because 

307.92 315.15 B: that sort of an attitude which is really tried to suppress dissent one at a time i think you really need it more 

315.30 315.94 A: mhm 

316.32 317.72 A: need to listen to other opinions 

318.00 318.54 B: yeah 

318.10 319.78 A: what interesting because i teach 

319.89 320.23 A: and 

320.76 326.64 A: my students tend to me they are inner city students they tend to be very conservative too 

327.20 327.73 B: mhm 

327.26 327.88 A: so i'm 

328.04 331.53 A: even reluctant when they ask me my opinion to express that 

331.88 335.40 B: as a teacher you are also in a very unique situation 

337.10 337.52 A: why 

337.99 341.14 B: well ah just seems to me that 

341.79 345.18 B: i you really can't do such 

345.39 349.07 B: to an extreme extent within your job to express your opinion 

348.87 349.38 A: right 

350.24 351.92 A: right because we're so influential 

352.23 352.66 A: that is 

352.31 352.83 B: mhm 

353.00 354.39 A: yeah that's true 

355.59 363.98 A: but it it when i'm asked my opinion and they have you know they kids have asked me i let them know that i have gone to the march 

364.09 364.64 B: mhm 

364.27 367.29 A: except that it was so exciting and i brought back some 

367.66 374.23 A: some information in other languages to share with them since i'm a foreign language teacher and 

371.14 371.76 B: mhm 

374.52 378.87 A: and they asked me why i felt that way so and i said it's just my opinion and i'm i'm 

379.56 386.81 A: more or less i'm fairly pacifistic about that so i really don't believe in more settling disputes 

388.60 389.94 A: but it's it's interesting 

390.29 391.55 A: to talk with them 

392.36 392.92 B: oh yeah 

392.38 397.27 A: and many of them are relatives who are in the military so that puts them in a different position too 

397.02 397.64 B: mhm 

399.04 400.40 B: yeah aha um 

401.14 406.33 B: yeah oh yeah oh yeah and given your um aha 

406.43 408.14 B: you said your d._c. area 

408.00 408.71 A: right 

408.78 409.26 B: yeah 

409.36 411.48 B: some places like (( )) 

412.31 419.04 B: and that yes oh boy and also let's face there's been a very 

414.18 415.19 A: yeah 

419.46 424.85 B: large scale propaganda (( purchased )) for the last two years 

425.07 426.14 A: yeah definitely 

427.61 429.06 A: and one wonders why that 

429.17 430.44 A: being done too you know 

430.51 432.22 B: mhm well i mean i just 

432.50 444.25 B: i just found that i was all too convenient for the presidency to suddenly start pushing for iraq and all when they even haven't finished the eh 

445.19 446.94 B: i eh 

447.61 449.15 B: suppressing the 

450.58 451.90 B: taliban and al qaeda 

451.56 452.05 A: right 

452.51 454.11 A: right and and the idea that they 

454.29 456.10 A: they haven't found bin laden yet 

463.80 464.46 A: mhm 

465.59 466.13 A: no 

467.34 467.84 A: yeah 

468.45 469.48 A: we agree to much 

469.80 473.74 A: doesn't make as controversial as they probably wanted it to be huh 

477.20 478.11 B: i 

478.62 484.48 B: i sort of suspect that i'm not going to be ment- i don't think it's the argument they are looking for 

484.00 487.20 A: no i think it's the language ah it's the use of language 

485.85 487.92 B: mhm but ah 

488.54 490.92 B: i don't i've been following the eh 

491.31 499.63 B: the issue and what i'm rather disappointed in right now is that the u._n. hasn't give out the a full 

500.51 501.11 B: i 

501.23 505.98 B: given out the full text of the iraq report to the eh 

506.10 509.30 B: non permanent security council members 

509.72 515.31 A: they are only doing it to the because i haven't i haven't followed i've been doing something else they are only doing it to the permanent members 

512.45 513.49 B: oh 

515.24 517.07 B: the permanent members and 

515.58 517.39 A: i know the united states is getting it 

517.92 520.13 B: full and unedited 

520.63 526.91 B: copies of the eleven thousand page report the elected members are getting an edited 

527.46 528.74 B: an censored version 

527.48 527.89 A: hum 

529.21 531.00 A: and have they explained why they are doing that 

531.00 540.17 B: ah well they said that it's in part to prevent any so called ah ah bio-warfare or nuclear secrets from getting out 

540.27 541.00 A: oh dear 

541.49 542.01 A: from who 

542.09 543.68 B: well that's 

543.81 545.43 B: the u._n.'s rationale 

545.42 546.06 A: aha 

546.68 547.80 B: am 

548.42 550.30 B: i mean actually though i mean any 

550.51 555.08 B: person in second or third year chemistry or physics could ah 

555.31 557.43 B: do as well as existing sources 

558.03 559.94 A: right that's what i understand right 

559.74 560.23 B: yeah 

560.38 560.83 A: yeah
