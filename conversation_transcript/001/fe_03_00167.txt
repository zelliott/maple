128.45 134.83 B: i don't maybe like five years or so and i hadn't been to any halloween parties i hadn't even thought of costumes and then

158.32 159.00 A: uh 

159.81 165.80 A: but i do like christmas too christmas is it's fun it's nice to be able to see everybody and 

168.67 169.10 A: there's 

173.57 177.37 A: it's it's it's hard to decide i like i like holidays in general i think 

177.22 177.55 B: yeah 

178.44 179.16 A: um 

180.01 180.54 B: for 

180.98 183.55 B: the decorations or the celebration or 

185.48 186.66 A: um i guess 

187.16 189.73 A: i don't know i guess getting together with my family is nice 

190.17 194.98 B: something to give you a day off of work every month i 

192.90 196.78 A: well there's that 

196.92 198.24 A: but it's 

198.91 199.85 A: it's kind of like 

202.63 205.34 A: you know you you take a break from your regular life 

205.87 206.19 B: yeah 

206.39 207.24 A: and 

208.98 210.23 A: you know you think about 

210.98 212.42 A: another year going by 

213.28 214.23 A: and 

216.59 217.98 A: i guess it's 

218.90 220.82 A: it's sort of a nice break in the routine 

221.30 221.66 B: yeah 

222.17 224.84 A: you know whether whether you go somewhere or not 

225.04 225.63 A: uh 

226.61 227.99 A: thanksgiving is always nice 

228.42 228.81 B: mhm 

229.22 230.80 A: the food there is is wonderful 

232.45 233.84 A: um 

235.88 236.92 A: yeah i guess 

237.98 238.73 A: i guess 

239.73 241.54 A: getting together with the family is 

241.85 243.11 A: is what i like about it 

243.54 244.24 A: um 

246.33 247.34 A: mmm how about 

247.14 248.79 B: and something you said made me think too 

249.06 249.52 B: that 

249.87 250.58 B: breaking up 

250.72 251.13 B: the 

251.83 255.30 B: everything else that's going on th- uh for a lot of the holidays 

255.64 257.63 B: they're things that we don't 

257.75 260.18 B: we should probably think about more often 

260.33 263.95 B: mother's day father's day thanksgiving time christmas 

264.10 265.77 B: um the meaning behind them 

264.13 264.56 A: mhm 

266.13 266.49 B: but 

266.20 266.56 A: right 

266.72 268.28 B: if we get all caught up in 

268.93 271.27 B: the craziness of life 

271.39 274.16 B: um then we don't take the time so i guess it's nice to 

274.62 276.67 B: also to set aside that opportunity 

277.03 277.42 A: right 

277.33 279.04 B: to focus more on that and 

279.79 280.19 B: not 

280.76 281.56 B: all those things that are 

281.70 285.62 B: probably not as important but that we tend to prioritize 

285.89 287.34 A: yeah i don't know i mean 

289.11 290.18 A: for me it's 

290.86 294.44 A: you know all the commercialization of christmas is not not a real problem 

295.04 295.38 B: uh-huh 

295.06 295.62 A: uh 

296.63 298.98 A: because most of the gifts i give are 

299.26 300.32 A: i make anyway 

300.77 301.27 B: do you really 

301.32 302.28 A: uh yeah 

302.66 303.89 A: well i mean i can't afford 

304.17 305.33 A: to buy them 

305.19 305.58 B: uh-huh 

305.47 306.70 A: um 

307.79 308.31 A: so 

308.79 310.38 B: but even if you could would you still 

310.59 313.13 B: do stuff or do you like craft kind of things or 

312.82 315.31 A: oh yeah yeah i do i i do a lot of art 

315.45 317.29 A: painting and print making uh

322.82 323.38 A: you know 

323.80 327.23 A: i try to like when my friends have babies i try to give them a baby quilt 

328.10 329.53 B: wow uh that's awesome 

328.66 329.25 A: um 

329.83 332.90 A: yeah it's it's really fun i like to do it 

333.08 333.75 A: uh 

335.18 336.97 A: you know in the evening when i'm watching the news 

337.68 338.06 A: that's 

338.92 340.63 A: that's kind of nice it's relaxing 

340.94 341.44 B: okay 

341.85 342.96 A: so uh 

343.80 344.20 A: but 

344.74 346.55 A: but it is hard trying to 

347.55 353.02 A: trying to make enough presents for everybody the the the kids i buy presents for because 

350.00 350.54 B: uh-huh 

353.65 354.25 A: you know they 

354.76 355.60 A: they're not into 

355.93 357.41 A: homemade presents usually 

356.79 361.92 B: yeah they sometimes don't appreciate the very nice quilt that it took you hours and hours to make 

360.08 360.69 A: uh 

361.77 363.30 A: yeah i mean um 

362.86 365.79 B: they just want the new barbie doll that came out or something 

365.99 366.65 A: so 

366.83 369.49 A: yeah i well i have five i have 

370.01 373.22 A: three nephews and my brother just got married and now i have five nephews 

373.94 374.54 A: so

377.73 383.85 B: that's true okay we and i g._i. joe okay i was going to say i don't even have any clue what 

384.03 387.13 A: but it's also hard because i mean buying presents because 

387.74 389.01 A: so many of the things 

390.34 391.86 A: like when when i was growing up 

392.01 394.18 A: the toys were not expensive 

394.81 396.28 A: uh nowadays 

396.59 397.54 A: you know kids want 

398.31 400.52 A: video games computer games 

401.31 401.93 A: uh 

402.66 405.09 A: they're i mean they're unaffordable 

404.82 405.20 B: yeah 

405.46 410.05 A: uh it's like crazy i mean you used to be able to fill a living room 

410.46 411.23 A: uh 

411.68 414.25 A: you know for a couple hundred dollars and now 

414.03 414.28 B: yep 

415.09 415.90 A: i mean 

416.39 418.41 A: that's four video games 

416.78 417.49 B: can't do it 

418.50 418.90 B: yeah 

418.57 422.02 A: so yeah it's i guess it it's different 

422.23 422.82 A: um 

423.33 424.57 A: i usually give my nephews 

424.68 425.18 A: books 

425.87 426.48 A: uh 

427.05 428.15 A: you know or toys 

428.34 429.67 A: if i know what they want but 

428.43 428.78 B: mhm 

431.71 432.31 A: uh 

434.04 437.19 B: that is one of the things when when the question talked about 

434.09 434.56 A: i mean 

437.76 439.60 B: if you could create a holiday 

439.75 441.96 B: how would you have people celebrate it that 

442.43 443.18 B: it would 

443.47 445.11 B: be nice if we could get 

445.71 447.27 B: kind of away from 

448.12 450.01 B: the commercialization or the 

450.25 452.97 B: you know that it's got to be a huge gift giving thing 

453.51 453.85 B: um 

454.00 456.26 B: i don't know how yeah yeah 

454.10 455.79 A: a huge money spending thing 

456.68 459.60 A: yeah no that's nice it would it would be a nice un- 

456.89 458.97 B: i don't know how we could do that but 

459.80 463.79 A: a nice holiday if you didn't have to buy anything 

464.88 465.55 A: um 

464.91 467.56 B: (( )) i think about my grandparents telling me stories of 

472.74 473.21 A: mhm 

480.47 481.59 B: it would take away 

481.91 483.11 B: (( )) the distraction 

483.36 483.80 A: yeah 

483.62 487.43 B: of everyone as soon as you open presents then wanting to run off and do your own thing and 

487.74 488.16 A: right 

487.87 489.41 B: and maybe encourage more 

490.15 492.34 B: family time or reflection or 

490.20 490.76 A: yeah 

492.55 493.05 B: whatever 

493.69 497.40 B: i don't know but maybe life in general can't go back to that at this point 

493.85 494.68 A: yeah or just 

497.79 499.92 A: uh i don't know i i think 

501.05 502.67 A: i think it depends on 

504.41 505.72 A: you know what you 

506.21 507.24 A: how you deal with it 

508.12 508.82 A: uh 

509.63 511.36 A: it's also harder because people 

512.19 512.54 A: you know 

512.93 516.54 A: not everybody in a family lives in the same place anymore 

516.67 517.03 B: mhm 

516.95 521.47 A: people are so much more spread out people go to other cities to get jobs 

521.68 522.78 A: you know they go to 

524.32 526.80 A: i mean it's it's hard you know uh 

529.56 532.01 A: and then traveling is a pain 

532.24 532.93 A: uh 

533.67 535.23 A: i yeah i don't know uh 

538.94 540.24 A: nobody buys anything 

542.52 544.35 B: and hallmarks not allowed to make cards 

544.47 545.02 A: no 

545.33 548.70 A: no and no no t._v. commercials um 

548.99 553.68 B: and no decorations 

551.60 553.70 A: no decorations uh 

555.30 556.78 A: yeah what would you call it 

558.14 558.80 A: um 

564.68 566.06 A: i'm not feeling very creative 

568.13 572.85 B: wa- you're the artistic creative one i am not at all so
