0.76 1.93 B: hello 

1.54 5.23 A: hello [cough] my name's laurie 

3.27 4.33 B: hi 

4.76 6.04 B: (( i'm arda )) 

5.86 7.08 A: (( hi arda )) 

6.46 7.51 B: hi 

7.69 10.00 A: we got a tough question today 

9.36 13.63 B: i know i'm [laughter] surprised um [lipsmack] so what do you thing 

10.02 12.24 A: [laughter] 

13.59 21.02 A: well i didn't really have too much time to think about it so i'm gonna go from the top of my head um 

21.21 25.09 A: [mn] i really feel that um the u._n. 

25.31 29.04 A: should [cough] take all its time 

29.16 30.45 A: in um 

30.72 32.21 A: inspecting 

32.47 33.81 A: um 

34.99 38.67 A: [mn] i don't believe [noise] that we should go into a war 

38.72 39.65 A: um 

39.90 41.17 A: as 

41.22 45.17 A: we hear every single day on the news and you know 

44.19 45.02 B: yeah 

45.25 46.37 A: um 

46.68 49.06 A: i have my personal um 

49.58 55.30 A: feelings about any war um and to me this is just too too scary 

55.14 67.65 B: yeah um [sigh] i i've kind of been struggling with this issue back and forth for a while now and i i'm really not sure where i stand because on one hand i kind of feel like something has to be done 

67.73 70.63 B: um i'm just not sure what um 

70.84 76.21 B: i kind of think that things in that part of the world have to be kept in check somehow 

76.60 77.63 B: um 

78.61 79.48 B: i'm 

79.68 89.26 B: i it's easy for me to say that i'm not as opposed to war as a lot of other people but that's only because i haven't had any 

89.48 94.94 B: first hand or even [sigh] you know remotely related experience with it um 

95.48 97.90 B: so i don't feel as strongly against 

98.08 100.41 B: going to war there um 

100.76 105.84 B: just because i do i i just keep thinking of the future evolution of that region of the world 

108.77 112.79 A: [noise] [noise] [mn] well i can agree with you somewhat [cough] 

112.96 122.29 A: somewhat i can't because um [mn] you know we still have the terrorists what about that and um 

120.93 121.78 B: (( you know yeah )) 

122.53 131.71 A: [mn] in my opinion i feel that they are linked but i just feel so saddened that so many innocent people 

132.34 136.23 A: um in that area um 

137.35 147.32 A: the israelis are going to be um part of it there's going to be so many other targets and we're not just fooling around with 

147.36 155.61 A: [mn] people coming in with guns you know these are rockets and missiles and god knows what it's scary to me 

155.53 165.14 B: that's true i mean i- [lipsmack] it's true that when you're talking about rockets and missiles it's much less targeted in the sense that of course you're you're going to get lots more innocent people 

165.19 166.13 B: um 

166.20 168.82 B: and that's the part that terrifies me too 

169.18 175.07 B: um but i guess the question is is that going to save more innocent people down the line mm 

174.98 175.90 A: [mn] 

175.98 177.77 A: (( [mn] who are we saving )) 

177.84 180.25 A: i don't really think we're um 

181.01 186.80 A: [cough] at the point now of [mn] it's even difficult to save ourselves 

186.92 187.94 A: um 

188.21 196.12 A: there's so many things i feel that we as americans just let go gun control law 

196.16 197.12 B: mhm 

196.44 199.96 A: you know where where you have a sniper 

200.04 205.57 A: of what happened um you know in the washington area and what's i live in um 

205.81 209.77 A: [mn] california southern california and what's happening here 

209.93 213.84 A: um that there's not enough of a police force 

214.87 215.62 B: (( mm yeah )) 

214.97 216.56 A: but yet 

217.33 225.65 A: [mn] where is all this i don't know i- i- it's very confusing to me [noise] i'm older i went through um [cough] 

226.60 235.93 A: um the vietnam war and um you know we were pacifists then and there was so much of a movement that was against it 

235.95 238.99 A: and you just don't have this now ah 

239.25 246.97 A: that i think president bush is getting a mandate and maybe you know who am i to say that he's wrong 

246.84 247.73 B: right 

248.45 255.33 B: yeah i mean that's that's part of it [mn] you know part of it has to do with how much do you trust that he knows [laughter] what he's doing 

255.59 256.51 B: um 

257.02 259.05 B: and i i have no idea [laughter] 

259.18 263.52 A: [mn] yeah but w- we've seen within the last um 

263.51 275.17 A: several months you know here people are just going out to have a nice evening for dinner and for dancing and they're getting blown up [mn] you know um 

271.21 271.93 B: right 

272.71 274.23 B: yeah 

276.17 279.21 A: [mn] if all if all that 

279.37 285.58 A: a war would do if it would stop it but i don't think it will because it only makes 

287.43 290.03 A: [cough] [noise] other people angrier 

290.33 291.49 B: yeah 

292.06 295.68 B: well yeah i mean that you've got a good point there but 

294.76 296.91 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

295.84 298.77 B: yeah that that's how they're going to respond 

298.88 302.17 B: if they're angry and if yeah it might not help 

301.09 303.38 A: and it seems like um 

303.49 307.47 A: [cough] it's so simple you have a ah a person 

307.55 310.02 A: individuals that say 

310.34 322.98 A: i know i can um take out at least forty or fifty people on a bus or that and it's okay that i give my life you know that this is the difficult thing for me to understand 

318.65 319.61 B: yeah 

322.41 323.82 B: yeah 

323.14 326.39 A: this martyrism that they claim to have 

324.40 325.54 B: right well 

325.76 332.35 B: once you have people who are not afraid to die then that's that's it that pretty much out for any kind of 

330.31 337.19 A: [noise] well the american military they're not afraid to die either you know but at least there's 

337.36 340.80 A: you know they're going through a process [noise] [mn] 

339.84 340.71 B: right 

341.39 348.86 B: but i don't think they have the attitude that i mean what's different is that the terrorists have the attitude that they're not afraid to die and they don't care who they take with them 

348.52 350.41 A: right right 

349.14 352.09 B: and i think the military does care who they take with them 

351.85 353.21 A: oh sure 

353.23 365.60 A: sure [mn] but i really feel that we should see you know l- like make it like i imagine it is like a chess game or whatever you want to call it you know 

365.73 366.84 A: um 

367.80 370.84 A: [mn] see exactly what happens um 

371.31 373.36 A: you know with this um 

373.49 377.33 A: investigation that they are doing in iraq [mn] 

376.69 377.68 B: yeah 

378.48 388.52 B: yeah i- i'm curious to see how it'll go i'm actually surprised at you know i've seen that there are quite a few protests but they seem to be really limited in number 

388.72 390.75 B: ah in the number of people that show up 

391.46 393.03 B: which is kind of interesting 

391.47 401.85 A: definitely definitely [noise] because um of i think what happened now of n- [cough] of nine eleven and it's really hard to um 

399.35 400.15 B: yeah 

401.98 404.22 A: you know separate um 

405.00 407.67 A: the groups um 

406.51 407.33 B: right 

407.80 408.36 A: (( [noise] )) 

408.20 415.01 B: yeah that's true i mean th- you're right that's a big part of it that that i- the entire middle east is being lumped into one group i think 

417.08 424.63 B: and i think a lot of people probably think that you know taking care of things in iraq is going to take of [mn] all the other problems [laughter] 

424.69 428.46 A: [mn] i don't know if if it does [laughter] i'm for it then 

428.46 431.02 B: yeah though i don't think it will 

429.02 437.42 A: i'm older and you know i'm older now and um i have a lot of sadness you know all throughout the years um [cough] 

439.00 441.35 A: you always look towards um 

441.75 449.44 A: your country to be peaceful and to be fair and so many times they're not you know we're 

447.74 448.78 B: yeah 

450.93 464.03 A: [noise] cheating children out of a decent education we're making it so difficult for um homeless people we're making it difficult for people that enjoyed you know at least having 

464.12 473.63 A: you know jobs and a home and every time you turn around it's so sad you know this one's going out of business and that one's going out of business and 

473.76 474.72 A: you know 

475.51 478.78 A: [mn] it's hard it's really difficult on um 

479.77 481.96 A: on us americans [laughter] now 

481.56 482.64 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

483.11 487.72 B: well yeah you sound like you're speaking from a lot more experience than i am [laughter] 

487.74 494.14 A: [mn] well i'm a senior citizen and unfortunately you know i um have to um 

494.97 505.47 A: [mn] depend on ah medicare and the little bit of savings that i had um is dwindling now because our coverage is so poor 

497.21 498.14 B: yeah 

505.57 506.78 B: yeah 

506.17 513.40 A: it's so so very poor and what can you say you know i say to myself i'd rather see the younger people 

514.09 520.91 A: [mn] the schools at least you know where we're giving kids a good education because that's the main thing 

520.55 521.49 B: yeah 

522.23 524.27 B: yeah that's true that's a big issue 

525.11 525.98 B: um 

526.27 529.12 B: ri- right so back to the iraq thing though [laughter] 

528.45 529.31 A: [mn] 

529.36 530.35 B: um 

531.07 534.62 B: what do you think is is actually going to be the outcome of this 

534.30 539.37 A: i don't know i don't know i i i don't want to [sigh] 

539.38 543.84 A: i i have a a somewhat belief in my heart that [mn] 

545.00 549.58 A: things will take its place sometime next year 

549.50 550.47 B: mhm 

550.33 555.80 A: um because it's going to take them several um [mn] 

556.38 564.88 A: a week or something you know to go over all the reports and um [mn] i just feel that we have 

560.50 561.35 B: yeah 

564.89 572.46 A: [mn] enough on the boil with our special militaries and stuff like that where um 

573.31 588.07 A: they may be able to be guided because we're not the only ones involved the english are involved [noise] the canadians and [mn] there's so much that they can see you know through their reconnaissance and 

579.48 580.49 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

584.57 585.34 B: mhm 

588.24 593.85 A: i don't know what to say about it i'm just p- praying that [cough] [noise] 

596.89 602.36 A: i don't think um i i i think there'll be some some type of confrontation 

603.14 612.14 A: but how how that is we don't really know they're not they're not really giving [mn] out all that information 

607.63 608.46 B: yeah 

611.93 613.23 B: yeah that's true 

612.65 615.50 A: and in a way i don't really want to know 

615.51 622.82 A: you know i i have trust in ah [mn] in in our president and um you know 

623.21 624.21 A: [mn] 

624.20 625.21 B: yeah 

624.46 629.54 A: all the people that are um working um [mn] you know in this 

629.23 630.12 B: yeah 

630.51 634.27 B: yeah well let's let's hope that ah that they know what they're doing 

635.58 638.43 B: that's that's the only thing we can hope for [laughter] i think 

637.69 640.46 A: uh-huh but do you think we're going to have a war 

640.07 646.61 B: i i honestly don't know i mean i don't i don't even know how to how to make that judgment um 

641.84 642.90 A: yeah 

646.94 648.33 B: i have no idea 

649.07 657.29 B: i i get the feeling that this administration is being much more maybe i'm naive but much more secretive than the last one 

657.20 667.93 B: um i don't think that we know everything that's going on behind the scenes so i don't i i don't really feel like i could make a guess as to what's happening or what's going to happen because i just think we we know only a fraction 

667.85 669.34 A: [mn] me too 

668.01 669.94 B: of what they have in mind 

669.72 672.80 A: and you know i think a lot of it is um 

674.10 678.79 A: [mn] we just hear ah maybe seven to ten words 

678.90 681.28 A: when the president does speak 

681.10 682.18 B: yeah 

681.64 694.47 A: or you know whoever else is is talking on the matter we only hear a small fraction and this is i'm really annoyed at the darn television i try to you know read some of um 

694.98 699.17 A: [mn] the new york times and we have um [cough] 

696.39 697.41 B: (( yes yeah )) 

699.87 702.68 A: um oh what's that um 

702.72 707.50 A: program it it it they have a decent news hour 

707.51 719.23 A: on and you know they have again a lot of people coming in and giving their thoughts um [mn] um but so i kind of go by what they're saying and [cough] 

707.69 708.64 B: yeah 

719.45 719.89 A: (( th ))
