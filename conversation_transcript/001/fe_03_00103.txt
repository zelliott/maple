59.66 67.33 A: yeah i mean like um actually the name is like reality t._v. but since that is not my reality i never spent time on watching stuff like that 

67.77 68.23 B: mhm 

68.69 69.94 A: so i don't know (( how )) about you 

70.76 74.86 B: well i k- i kind of i watched the very very first survivor

78.66 79.11 A: uh-huh 

78.95 89.25 B: and i watched after we knew who the survivor was so a great element of of you know like the t- trying to figure out and guessing and stuff was lost 

82.38 83.23 A: uh-huh 

89.10 89.67 A: uh-huh 

89.55 91.23 B: but and i kind of 

91.43 94.83 B: thought it was interesting because it was new at that time 

93.85 94.33 A: uh-huh 

94.66 95.19 A: oh yeah 

95.14 96.29 B: but then 

96.43 97.41 B: i sort of 

97.58 97.97 B: um 

98.55 101.46 B: realized that it's not really reality t._v. 

101.16 102.29 A: yeah 

101.67 108.89 B: and that it has the people work really hard to on the plot and they reshoot it and stuff 

106.58 107.14 A: uh-huh 

108.72 109.35 A: oh yeah 

109.39 110.11 B: so um 

109.61 110.08 A: yeah 

118.73 124.06 A: (( )) being on the show like tha- after that it's like i went back to turkey 

119.42 119.86 B: mhm 

124.25 124.69 B: mhm 

124.86 130.49 A: and i never had the chance to watch it but like as you said it's an arranged uh plot so like 

131.01 131.88 A: you can kind of 

132.53 134.39 A: um guess what's going to happen 

134.82 135.26 B: yeah 

135.45 135.89 A: yeah 

136.30 141.51 B: why do you think i mean it seems uh everybody talks about like this 

141.72 150.42 B: well last year and probably the year before that being uh the era of reality t._v. because suddenly they had (( all those )) shows that were really popular 

149.89 151.23 A: uh-huh mhm 

150.70 152.92 B: i mean why do you think that they 

153.20 155.05 B: became popular all of a sudden 

162.27 162.80 B: mhm 

162.82 171.41 A: that maybe so um the second thing is like a spectators are always so you like um how can i say 

172.05 177.91 A: very into you like watching people's lives and their decisions and 

177.16 178.34 B: yeah 

178.01 179.79 A: they are you know like 

178.56 183.11 B: like gossiping is better you can actually look at people doing stuff

196.37 196.96 A: things like that 

209.99 210.58 A: uh-huh 

210.33 218.09 B: and all of a sudden they had like you know people from next door doing all those exciting stuff and you can imagine wow i c- that could be me but 

213.28 213.83 A: uh-huh 

217.09 218.79 A: yeah yeah yeah yeah 

226.80 227.64 A: uh-huh

236.34 237.37 A: hm 

236.92 242.86 B: like the one where you have to answer questions and like if you answer fifteen questions you can you can win a million dollars 

243.80 248.82 A: i i know the similar one but like i am an international student so i don't have much information about 

248.92 252.11 A: stuff but i know the concept of the um program 

251.56 254.46 B: you don't watch t._v. shame on you

275.82 276.22 B: oh 

278.52 279.26 B: right 

279.09 285.11 A: but mostly uh the quality of the programs are not you know like eee not appealing for me 

292.47 293.13 A: uh-huh 

292.69 296.68 B: yeah it is becoming more interesting because i think i am deteriorating 

295.25 295.71 A: uh-huh

303.96 305.98 B: on u._p._n. they had 

306.08 311.77 B: um i think i watched it like a couple of weeks ago but i think it was actually uh filmed um 

311.95 314.75 B: a year or so ago they had a show about um 

314.87 317.71 B: people from like an english family 

317.55 318.03 A: mhm 

317.81 323.59 B: living in a victorian house for i think six months they had they had them live there 

320.12 320.62 A: mhm 

323.97 326.25 B: which was kind of interesting 

324.23 324.90 A: oh 

325.89 333.26 A: oh yeah i i watched one like that like um they would live in an environment like nintee- e- eighteen hundreds 

333.19 334.90 B: yeah i think maybe it is the same one 

335.01 337.52 A: oh yeah and they were getting married 

336.16 336.83 B: that was 

338.47 341.10 B: were they then maybe it wasn't the one 

339.41 339.89 A: uh 

340.96 341.60 A: uh maybe 

342.17 345.55 A: but it was like a (( )) life like not a victorian style (( stuff )) 

342.24 342.58 B: (( )) 

345.70 350.66 B: oh because there was a- also one on u._p._n. where they were living in mon- montana 

350.51 351.05 A: uh-huh 

358.10 358.57 A: mhm 

358.11 361.61 B: they put them in this deserted place in montana and had them 

361.75 366.51 B: you know like b- b- be farmers and have like to make their own 

367.41 370.94 B: well uh have to sort of supply everything 

370.79 372.47 A: oh maybe that was it 

372.79 376.43 A: i don't know like (( it's )) the girl in the end (( that get marries )) 

372.98 373.31 B: yeah 

376.95 378.47 A: in an old fashioned style 

377.23 382.82 B: yeah yeah i think yeah there was there was one couple there who were engaged and then they got married after the 

382.58 383.14 A: oh yeah 

383.70 384.25 A: o._k. 

383.83 384.24 B: so 

384.50 385.54 A: that's it yeah 

391.30 391.78 A: uh-huh 

393.47 394.06 B: it sort of 

394.49 398.27 B: it's more it gives you more information i think than just reading a book 

398.03 405.74 A: mhm i mean no like that program was o._k. like it was really very interesting to learn about another culture actually you are living history 

398.82 399.14 B: (( )) 

402.76 403.19 B: yeah 

406.49 406.84 A: so it's 

407.19 407.89 A: kind of nice 

417.16 417.64 A: uh-huh 

417.21 420.14 B: but i think even for people who watched it it was 

420.49 420.97 A: mhm 

420.53 425.99 B: informative but then they have the shows like the bachelor which you probably heard about 

421.57 422.36 A: mhm yeah 

426.09 426.77 A: oh yeah 

426.87 434.38 B: that was i was just so shocked that they even showed this in a on prime time t._v. 

427.28 427.90 A: yeah 

433.72 438.39 A: oh yeah i- i have the odds with that too like the prime t._v. programs here are like 

438.59 439.77 A: making me very surprised 

439.96 446.27 B: yeah sex and uh i mean it just it just felt like you know there are like twenty five whores 

441.03 441.76 A: (( i don't know )) 

446.12 446.62 A: uh-huh 

446.47 457.80 B: and uh there's this guy who has been i mean basically using everybody just for i mean i was just so disgusted i didn't watch it i watched i think like just 

457.98 462.47 B: fifteen minutes of one episode because everybody was talking about it 

462.31 462.85 A: uh-huh 

462.94 464.30 B: but it was 

465.61 466.79 B: disgusting 

467.83 468.99 B: yeah 

468.84 469.49 A: oh yeah 

469.66 471.62 B: so you don't watch much t._v. huh 

471.47 475.50 A: i i m- i mean like i am just trying to get used to the environment here 

478.89 479.32 B: mhm 

479.34 483.25 A: so like um i am moving from places to places actually so i have 

483.36 485.79 A: really rarely (( to have )) time to watch um t._v. 

486.06 487.64 B: how long are you going to be here 

487.90 488.52 B: in total 

488.07 491.34 A: um i'm going to be i think one and a half years more 

491.92 492.29 B: oh 

492.53 493.30 A: yeah 

492.99 493.93 B: that's cool 

493.78 497.37 A: so like if i have my own cab- cable t._v. i will have 

497.55 498.67 A: more you know like 

498.87 499.26 A: choice 

499.43 500.87 A: to watch whatever i want to 

499.44 500.00 B: yeah 

500.99 506.13 B: i am trying not to i'm so afraid of getting cable t._v. because i know that i'll never study 

506.35 512.27 B: i have to i mean even now even with uh i don't know six channels that we have 

512.28 512.80 A: mhm 

516.83 517.25 A: yeah 

524.87 529.51 A: yeah it is even worse like uh yeah i i watch d._v._d._s. and stuff like that but not 

530.13 531.75 A: into television programs 

532.18 532.58 B: yeah 

532.63 535.28 A: because even tonight like i have to write a paper 

535.40 535.85 B: mhm 

535.59 537.13 A: and if i just you like 

537.28 541.14 A: turn on the t._v. and start watching it it will already be like one a._m. 

541.25 541.76 B: yeah 

541.69 542.88 A: and i will lose the time 

543.12 549.47 B: but in a way i mean i don't know because maybe well i'm also an international student so watching 

547.86 548.31 A: mhm 

558.07 558.56 A: mhm 

558.58 563.78 B: and i think in a way television exposes you to an aspect that you sort of can't 

564.45 566.29 B: can't learn otherwise 

566.35 572.17 A: mhm i don't know maybe i am at a stage that i am not interested in learning anything about america because i'm having 

573.67 574.99 B: yes
