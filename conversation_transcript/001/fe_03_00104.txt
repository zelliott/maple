28.08 28.99 B: reality t._v. 

36.23 36.99 B: yeah there was like 

36.35 37.14 A: meet some guy 

37.13 39.52 B: he starts off with uh twenty five women and he has to 

39.88 41.69 B: cut them down with every episode uh 

42.04 44.98 B: and finally end up with one who he proposes to at the end 

45.55 49.30 B: and everybody kind of you know grits their teeth and you know votes for a couple of girls (( )) 

49.61 50.17 B: something like that 

50.90 54.76 B: but i've never actually watched any of the other ones like who wants to be a millionaire or 

55.36 55.88 B: um 

56.62 57.66 B: (( )) other one survivor 

57.95 60.87 A: survivor and then there was something about 

61.32 63.23 A: temptation island and 

64.24 68.28 B: cool i know so like stuff like shipmates and stuff maybe that's reality t._v. 

68.92 73.17 A: i don't know what that is you know what i this is a i don't watch t._v. very much 

73.48 77.08 A: i don't know what that one is 

76.24 78.63 B: well i think that's the one in which um 

79.41 84.72 B: they take two people and they pu- send them on a blind date except it's for three days on a ship cruise 

85.65 97.38 B: and they have like they video basically everything that they do and usually they start out on the first day being really nice to each other on the second day they like each other and on the third day they can't stand each other and never want to see each other again type of thing you know 

97.90 98.37 B: um 

98.17 99.50 A: that sounds kind of frightening 

99.59 101.61 B: it it is actually quite scary 

101.83 102.23 B: to 

101.92 103.39 A: s- so you watch that one 

103.63 106.38 B: um i've onl- like i don't watch any of them 

107.59 109.26 B: religiously but if i happen to 

109.59 111.76 B: have a t._v. on then i flip over to something 

112.11 112.61 A: uh-huh 

114.19 115.61 B: you don't watch any of those 

115.49 116.36 A: no 

118.36 119.93 A: so what's like the draw 

120.70 121.42 B: i think 

122.27 124.93 B: i know cause people are usually so boring on their own 

125.75 126.40 B: um 

126.61 127.97 B: and you know their lives kind of 

128.14 131.62 B: tend to be boring so they want to look at what other people are doing 

132.82 133.34 B: i don't know i 

132.88 133.84 A: to get ideas 

134.18 137.91 B: yeah and you know i i think the whole bachelor thing was uh 

138.55 141.36 B: oh my you know this huge successful man which 

141.55 152.55 B: most people won't really ever get to meet a man like that but somebody's met and let's see who he picks and you know is it going to be a blonde very pretty looking girl or is it going to be a brunette and basically i think 

152.68 154.10 B: i don't know it's a whole celebrity thing 

155.49 155.96 A: hm 

157.40 160.71 B: i don't know i think that's the same way that you know why people read tabloids and 

161.15 166.39 B: why tabloids are printed and stuff like that because because people kind of have boring lives of their own and they just want to 

166.93 169.11 B: have some kind of excitement but just not immediate 

169.24 170.36 B: direct excitement so 

170.42 171.73 A: that's a good theory 

172.08 173.05 B: what do you think 

175.15 177.35 A: i don't know i i think that's a pretty good 

177.68 179.03 A: assessment that uh 

179.25 180.41 A: people are bored 

180.73 181.43 A: or a 

183.26 185.58 A: i don't know maybe they like being voyeurs or something 

186.01 186.36 B: mm 

186.57 188.55 B: well the the fact that you turn on t._v. 

189.32 190.19 B: has to like 

190.27 192.45 A: there's something voyeuristic in that right 

191.90 193.24 B: yeah yeah and 

193.58 195.60 B: you know you're obviously looking for something 

196.03 197.93 B: that you're not getting outside and maybe 

198.25 200.76 B: you're too shy to go look for it outside you know cause 

200.88 201.94 B: i mean i'd be too scared to 

202.35 204.32 B: be one of those twenty five women too you know 

204.60 206.82 B: go run off to a man and see if he picks me 

207.41 208.59 B: but it's amusing anyways 

208.08 210.46 A: you think there's something about it that's like um 

213.03 214.66 A: i don't know th- that uh 

215.44 218.25 A: people think people are crazy enough to do something like that 

219.09 221.03 A: like the whole survivor thing like 

221.80 222.84 A: what kind of freak would 

223.27 224.71 A: actually take part in that 

225.12 225.91 B: yeah true 

227.01 231.25 B: i think also with i i think the last one the last guy who won is kind of older 

232.77 233.52 B: after a while 

233.65 237.05 B: it's like you know what i see things like iron man competition and stuff 

237.44 237.88 A: uh-huh 

237.90 246.75 B: and it's like i know i can't do such things but there's some kind of appreciation that people can do such things and you know what what limit they stretch themselves out to just to win a million dollars you know 

247.25 249.96 B: so i guess it's right the same way you think (( )) freaks out there 

250.19 258.40 A: right like um i think i've seen that one um it's not really a reality show i don't think it's more like a game show um what is that called 

256.69 256.96 B: mhm 

258.68 259.65 A: fear factor 

260.42 260.76 B: hmm 

260.53 261.28 A: have you seen that 

261.44 263.74 B: i think so is that where people like (( )) 

264.41 265.33 B: pit of snakes and 

265.39 269.10 A: yeah or like they eat worms and cockroaches and 

265.74 266.65 B: what yeah yeah yeah 

267.94 268.64 B: yeah 

270.04 273.01 A: swim in shank t- shark tanks and so on 

274.07 278.13 B: i wonder if there's ever a reality t._v. show that deals with a regular thing 

278.29 279.13 B: you know that's not 

279.54 280.88 B: on the other end of the spectrum 

281.87 285.26 B: it has to be like if unless there's something bizarre it doesn't really 

286.13 287.02 A: they wouldn't tell 

286.27 286.61 B: uh 

287.16 290.38 B: yeah and then why do they call it reality cause technically that's not reality 

291.11 297.17 A: yeah well i i think you know what i think it's that they started off of that show the real world 

297.43 297.96 B: yeah 

298.35 299.91 A: the m._t._v. thing that they did 

300.03 300.67 B: yeah yeah yeah 

300.30 302.35 A: did they i don't know if they still do that anymore but um 

303.07 303.34 B: huh 

303.50 306.65 B: i i i i know of it but i've never seen it 

310.11 311.51 A: pull together in one house 

313.72 314.70 A: film there every 

316.83 317.22 B: and then 

316.99 317.58 A: and uh 

317.74 320.68 A: you know show what they thought were the interesting parts i guess 

320.67 320.99 B: oh 

321.33 322.01 A: um 

322.07 323.38 B: do they get on each other's nerves 

322.17 324.59 A: and usually they got in fights or some of them got 

324.19 324.73 B: oh wow 

324.89 327.10 A: you know hooked up or whatever 

328.21 328.83 A: but uh 

329.73 330.00 B: (( )) 

331.24 334.62 B: it it's like why people watch jerry springer because they know there's going to be a fight 

334.97 335.26 B: you know 

335.13 335.71 A: yeah 

337.15 339.14 B: an- and in some ways 

339.64 341.69 B: i was actually thinking about this because um 

342.43 349.67 B: ther- there was a call earlier and they asked me to hold on until they could find somebody and and they said that you know reality t._v. shows were 

350.04 354.12 B: um you know the theme for today and i was like you know what is reality t._v. anyways cause 

354.34 355.07 B: none of it is 

355.61 357.10 A: none of it's very real right 

355.74 356.31 B: actually 

356.83 358.59 B: yeah it never happens to me you know 

358.82 359.22 B: so 

358.91 359.77 A: yeah 

362.22 363.79 B: well 

363.44 364.97 A: so why do they call it that 

365.26 366.22 B: exactly and 

367.29 368.66 B: i don't know it just seems 

369.21 370.98 B: to me maybe they want it to be reality 

372.19 372.76 A: i think 

372.85 375.77 A: i don't know there's something about it not being scripted or something 

376.30 378.28 A: that makes it supposedly more real 

381.48 382.10 A: i guess 

383.34 387.04 B: or maybe like if you're watching it you wish that it was real for you in your life 

388.17 392.12 B: like you wish that you know you met a man who was a millionaire and he wanted to marry you 

393.05 393.35 B: but 

393.89 397.08 B: doesn't really happen to everybody so it's like a wish reality thing 

398.13 403.42 A: -ike i know i mean well also if that were the case wouldn't they call it like fantasy t._v. or something 

402.89 406.90 B: that would almost like that would become like bordering on porn then 

407.32 407.93 B: you know 

408.15 409.43 A: yeah right 

409.01 411.86 B: yeah it's like and people have a um 

412.26 412.81 B: (( )) 

412.92 415.07 B: people have a way of uh twisting things around 

418.23 420.32 A: i just wonder like where does it go from 

420.76 422.48 A: reality t._v. i mean 

423.73 428.15 B: well i think it's just going to get more and more bizarre you know like people doing strange things and 

428.68 430.56 B: um like right now i think there's like 

430.69 433.04 B: censorship that you can't show somebody who's like 

434.08 434.92 B: who died on 

435.15 437.11 B: t._v. or something you know you can't show something 

436.20 439.94 A: oh yeah in fact they have those videos you can buy i think 

439.46 441.41 B: yeah you can buy them uh cause 

441.64 443.87 B: i mean once you buy them it's not really censored you know 

444.23 444.80 A: right 

445.32 446.01 B: i i think 

446.55 448.85 B: that's going to happen that one point you know that 

449.14 452.84 B: they're going to show somebody who gets really badly hurt and they're going to show you scenes like that 

454.18 454.78 B: and 

454.92 456.77 B: i think there's definitely a market for that 

458.02 459.45 B: i nec- i don't nec- 

459.14 461.12 A: you think that would go on mainstream t._v. 

461.88 462.95 A: like people would watch it 

461.90 465.49 B: i think so i mean i think so because if they can tell you about 

466.01 468.57 B: um i think it was in one episode of um 

469.03 470.40 B: what was that survivor 

470.50 471.88 B: that somebody killed a pig 

472.04 473.45 B: on that island and 

473.96 478.98 B: like (( )) an island and i don't know if they necessarily showed it but there was a big hue and cry about it 

479.26 483.90 B: on like all the papers and on t._v. that they shouldn't really have shown it and stuff but i think 

484.41 489.65 B: when push comes to shove and you when they want there ratings to go higher they're going to show you more and more bizarre things you know 

490.39 490.69 A: well 

490.85 493.04 A: weren't they talking about televising um 

493.99 494.90 A: capital punishment 

496.10 496.72 B: yeah 

496.84 503.20 B: i (( )) oh yeah all the stuff that you that's on court t._v. i don't know if you watch that that's i guess that's reality t._v. too that cause they 

503.61 504.86 B: show you um 

505.88 508.81 B: like live telecasts of trials uh you know 

510.02 510.96 A: is that stuff real 

511.10 512.34 A: trials though like 

512.04 514.14 B: yeah well it is it is real 

515.13 516.26 A: but don't people agree to 

516.93 522.19 A: do something spe- like they they'll i don't know mediate or something if they or they accept 

523.00 526.04 A: because they're going on t._v. they do something different than they normally would 

525.95 528.77 B: oh no no no no not that stuff not not uh like 

528.32 529.36 A: not like judge judy 

529.39 530.31 B: no no no not those 

529.92 530.51 A: okay 

530.43 531.29 B: those those are like 

531.41 533.45 B: little civil court trials but 

533.56 535.05 B: like big trials like um 

535.86 538.35 B: rabbi neulander or somebody who killed his wife 

538.68 540.87 B: killed somebody else and then he got caught and 

541.02 542.56 B: this is an actual trial and 

543.88 544.47 B: televised it 

544.56 545.25 B: the whole thing 

545.69 548.59 B: uh and it's on a daily basis you know so they follow it 

548.74 551.39 B: and then every every so often they break 

551.75 555.22 B: and people comment on you know how the trial is going and it's actually real 

556.26 556.73 A: huh 

557.20 558.00 A: is that like 

558.28 561.36 A: i don't know some spin off of after the whole o._j. simpson 

561.48 563.43 B: yeah yeah yeah definitely you know wha- yeah 

564.14 565.18 B: i mean uh 

569.96 570.37 A: right
