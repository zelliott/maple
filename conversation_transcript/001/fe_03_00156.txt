0.80 1.89 A: hi i'm candace 

2.17 3.25 B: hi i'm becky 

3.62 5.11 A: i live in iowa 

5.40 7.17 B: i live in ohio 

6.66 8.19 A: o._k. um 

9.23 11.05 A: i i guess should i go first 

10.67 12.59 B: sure 

11.26 13.27 A: o._k. um 

13.63 16.75 A: is it disarming iraq should we disarm iraq um 

16.22 17.19 B: yeah 

17.94 18.59 A: well i'm 

19.62 23.46 A: i mean i guess in all interests it would be nice if 

24.44 29.20 A: we had better relations with them and weren't afraid of them doing horrible things to us but i'm not sure 

29.31 33.28 A: we can should just be able to march in there and say well we're going to tell you not to 

33.45 34.85 A: make this stuff and 

35.50 35.79 A: um 

35.88 38.53 A: you know put all these sanctions against you if you do 

39.73 41.97 A: but it seems to be that's what they're doing anyway 

53.77 54.21 A: states 

54.52 59.53 A: that makes it a little harder i think because i don't think as many countries are backing us as fervently as 

59.90 61.22 A: uh we would like them to be 

61.34 61.84 B: mhm 

62.54 65.11 A: so i i guess i have very mixed ideas about it 

69.08 72.12 B: phone rang i was just watching c._n._n. 

72.23 77.00 B: and uh unfortunately they were talking about the new economic 

77.22 81.14 B: person that they've app- that the president appointed and 

81.25 84.21 B: not about iraq as much so 

83.90 85.62 A: (( )) right up to it 

85.60 87.54 B: well i think um 

87.68 90.75 B: going back to iraq i think um 

91.16 93.37 B: there's a lot of stuff 

94.43 102.42 B: and the pic- i think it's really hard to know exactly what the intent is i mean a part of me 

102.78 105.88 B: wonders if it isn't left over from 

106.14 108.73 B: ten years ago and the gulf war 

107.12 108.00 A: oh sure 

108.57 110.33 A: i definitely think there's a lot of that 

110.26 115.58 B: yeah you know and and what amazes me is saddam is someone who we 

116.52 121.14 B: supported at one time you know and then 

121.85 122.57 B: we 

123.03 123.71 B: then 

124.19 126.06 B: decide not to support him 

125.86 126.41 A: right 

126.24 127.20 B: um 

127.35 128.32 B: and 

128.98 133.68 B: i think that is a set up for disaster now on the other hand 

131.80 132.20 A: mhm 

134.09 141.84 B: if they really mean what they say in that they have these weapons and that they are using them against their own people 

142.10 142.60 A: right 

142.27 146.70 B: and you know threatening to use it against the rest of the world and 

147.29 151.09 B: have been dodging you know what is considered universal 

152.09 155.07 B: rules of conduct you know then 

153.50 153.95 A: mhm 

156.39 158.33 B: i mean i don't know i think 

157.90 159.64 A: you're right you're right 

158.75 164.24 B: yeah i mean in one sense you know are we to wait for another 

164.58 166.32 B: you know september eleventh 

166.97 169.28 B: or do we you know 

170.28 174.87 B: disarm them i mean i've really i've never been a fan of 

171.91 172.37 A: right 

175.30 180.88 B: the u._s. kind of running around saying we're we say everything that goes but 

181.87 187.91 B: then again if you look at it like in terms of hitler an europe and how many people were 

186.25 186.73 A: sure 

188.82 189.68 B: isolated 

190.22 191.92 B: you know against uh 

192.04 195.14 B: i mean didn't know what was going on there and 

195.77 202.99 B: but i think uh you know there's a lot going on and and you had mentioned the u._s. and i think the u._s. and britain 

203.43 204.79 B: are the ones who are 

204.98 208.22 B: leading it britain seems to be very much behind it 

206.04 206.49 A: yeah 

208.22 214.77 A: yeah which i was actually a little bit surprised about i think i thought that um blair was um 

215.11 218.23 A: going to be much less for it and then he came out in 

220.46 220.86 A: (( )) 

222.11 222.77 A: but 

222.65 223.28 B: yeah 

223.10 225.14 A: you know them i'm reminded that before he 

225.48 227.42 A: kind of took the party he is now he was 

227.81 229.24 A: pretty conservative 

229.74 230.24 A: you know 

229.94 232.86 B: yeah yeah and so that makes me 

233.14 237.70 B: and then the fact that they did get everyone in the u._n. even syria to 

236.59 237.30 A: mhm 

238.07 243.26 B: agree makes me think that they know a lot more than the public may know 

238.16 238.73 A: yeah 

242.35 242.78 A: yeah 

250.10 254.55 A: and something should be done i guess i wish we were more consistent in 

254.76 256.68 A: doing these sort of things instead of 

257.26 257.61 A: um 

257.88 260.19 A: going over there when it suits us the most 

259.98 261.02 B: yeah 

260.56 261.57 A: i guess that's 

261.12 263.05 B: and and see i i see us 

261.97 263.78 A: that's where it seems kind of sketchy 

263.79 267.01 B: kind of going in like cowboys and then 

266.50 267.16 A: mhm 

267.64 269.87 B: like even with afghanistan 

270.07 273.86 B: they're so unstable right now and 

274.53 275.52 B: they 

275.92 279.42 B: you know really i mean if we're going to go in and 

279.54 282.40 B: change things then we also really need 

282.71 283.88 B: to go in and 

283.98 287.91 B: help build it up you know without imposing 

285.20 285.71 A: right 

285.99 286.38 A: right 

288.15 288.65 B: our 

289.31 290.12 B: you know 

291.04 293.43 B: i mean our religion or our 

293.14 293.61 A: mhm 

294.08 296.33 B: i mean i don't know 

295.53 298.66 A: we have to we have to help them with their infrastructure 

298.48 299.90 B: yes 

298.88 300.81 A: that that suits them i mean 

301.15 303.49 A: people who live in iraq are not american 

303.65 311.29 A: citizens and the things that we would like to have aren't going to work for them and and in the same way you're right i mean we need go in there and do 

304.50 305.01 B: right 

312.09 312.63 A: what 

312.79 315.36 A: you know the u._n. has decided needs to happen and then just not 

316.90 317.59 B: yeah 

318.82 319.75 A: stability i guess 

320.69 326.16 B: because i i do think um going back to ten years ago i heard a interview 

326.50 329.37 B: of uh on public radio 

329.60 334.64 B: of iraqi citizens in the united states who you know 

334.99 339.16 B: were so optimistic with what they thought were the promises 

339.49 340.57 B: of the u._s. 

341.19 345.60 B: and then they were just kind of left alone after they left um 

345.97 347.90 B: the gulf war and and they were 

346.68 347.21 A: yeah 

347.41 348.92 A: once we did what we 

349.43 350.83 A: was in our interest 

350.59 351.33 B: right 

351.09 352.96 A: it's just kind of like well we're never out of there 

353.00 356.59 B: yeah and i i think that really you know if we're going to do 

356.93 360.74 B: what we say we're going to do then we really need to also 

362.77 366.56 B: rebuild and stay with them and and help them 

363.56 364.04 A: mhm 

366.85 367.59 B: get their 

367.84 370.22 B: feet on the ground so to speak 

369.79 370.32 A: right 

370.70 378.50 A: it's like the difference between you know going around and changing things in the world that make it better for us we need to change it to make it better for everybody 

378.37 378.94 B: yes 

378.91 379.64 A: not just us 

379.05 379.62 B: yeah 

379.73 381.52 B: exactly exactly 

380.69 384.77 A: and i'm not even sure with you know the inspections that are going on now and it reminds me of 

384.92 387.62 A: you know the time before when they did the inspections although 

387.75 390.69 A: i was a lot younger then but i mean now it's like 

391.05 393.04 A: you know he stalled for this time 

393.32 398.21 A: and then we you know they finally get to sp- send the inspectors over there and i have to wonder 

398.31 402.91 A: you know the whole time before they're going over there and even now they're saying well we're not saying a whole lot we 

403.22 403.62 A: are 

403.96 408.62 A: kind of assuming i think people are assuming that they had all this time to hide things and so 

408.86 411.33 A: i'm not quite sure what they will get from it 

411.56 412.51 B: yeah i 

411.70 418.26 A: if they already kind of know that that's what happened then there you'd think there would be some other strategy 

418.62 420.46 A: although i don't know what it would be because we 

421.15 422.96 A: you know we had to wait for them to let 

423.10 424.41 A: the inspectors in 

424.31 425.10 B: mhm 

424.77 426.23 A: but they knew what was going to happen 

427.63 428.20 A: so 

428.69 431.64 A: it seems like we're doing it and we know that they're going to kind of 

432.50 433.99 A: cover everything up 

434.11 439.79 B: well one thing i did just see on c._n._n. they do this thing called the whip where they go um 

434.38 435.24 A: one thing i did 

440.50 444.45 B: to different spots where news is happening and give like a 

443.19 443.69 A: mhm 

444.67 448.44 B: a sound bite and then they go back and during the the 

448.82 449.97 B: sound bite part 

450.55 451.25 B: um 

451.55 453.32 B: one of the reporters is in 

453.71 455.61 B: q- qatar which is 

455.79 458.35 B: what i thought was qatar 

456.65 458.67 A: oh qatar okay yeah 

458.60 461.39 B: it's actually called qatar 

458.82 463.64 A: i think i read th- i was reading something about the the 

463.91 467.58 A: uh television station al jazeera or 

467.86 470.59 A: i think that's how you say and they mentioned the spelling of it 

470.40 472.68 B: yeah 

470.73 473.95 A: or the or the pronunciation of it and i was like oh that's funny 

479.65 487.99 B: you know from what he can tell their the troops are getting ready there's been a black out of you know um 

488.19 491.87 B: information media information so 

492.20 495.54 B: i mean even from that little sound bite it sounds like it's still 

495.86 497.84 B: you know going to happen 

497.61 498.52 A: something yeah 

498.87 499.92 B: but um 

500.13 501.86 B: you know i just 

502.06 504.70 B: i'm more worried about the ramifications 

504.62 505.43 A: sure 

505.44 507.91 B: in the middle east you know and 

506.70 507.09 A: sure 

508.28 509.47 B: i do think 

509.64 510.38 B: we 

510.73 512.40 B: have a hard time explaining 

513.02 515.64 B: uh what many perceive as 

515.95 519.48 B: going against islam going against the muslim religion 

517.94 518.69 A: mhm 

521.52 528.13 B: you know y- whether they agree or disagree i think that's an issue we are really 

529.09 533.70 B: struggling with right now and i think any kind of an invasion will 

534.34 536.26 B: uh just perpetuate that 

535.81 536.28 A: sure
