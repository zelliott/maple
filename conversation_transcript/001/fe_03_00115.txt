0.34 1.53 A: (( [lipsmack] hi )) 

1.80 4.56 B: hi my name's jeff hill i'm in boston 

4.58 7.16 A: okay i'm robin i'm in atlanta georgia 

6.95 8.25 B: hi robin 

8.39 10.22 A: good to meet you um 

10.75 12.55 A: so you want to you want to start off 

13.21 15.98 B: yeah you know it's interesting i've i've 

16.16 21.56 B: like everybody else i suppose i think about this and i almost go back and forth on 

21.45 30.48 B: you know i'm of one of two minds on the one hand it seems like a very dangerous precedent to go marching in to other countries just because we don't like what they're doing 

30.27 31.16 A: of course 

30.32 44.77 B: on t- and i'm i'm constantly reminded of of world war two and saying gee in nineteen thirty eight or thirty seven if someone had marched into germany to start hitler stop hitler wouldn't we all be in a much better situation [mn] and 

44.10 44.92 A: right 

45.44 56.01 B: i'll tell ya i'm i'm not sure which one of those is the more valid or i mean they're both valid but which one of those should guide our actions is is a decision i guess i i'm i'm i'm not able to come to 

56.07 68.00 A: well do you feel like it's kind of out of our hands also like i i feel like there's not even really going to be a decision made like the decision has already been made and this is all kind of a formality like the inspections and all that i think 

68.24 70.83 A: [mn] somewhere in there bush will find something that 

71.76 72.82 A: that he 

71.88 85.93 B: yeah i guess i'm not quite so fatalistic i mean i you know i i i feel as though i'd be willing to believe [noise] that that it's true but i i think if you look at the history of what's happened you know he's basically ah 

72.90 73.83 A: (( he would )) 

85.86 99.58 B: you know made very strong statements and then backed down i- in fact i had this kind of you know in terms of strange conp- conspiracy theories i had this kind of thought well what if in fact he's staging this whole thing what if he never intended to 

99.64 114.64 B: invade iraq but just really wanted this inspection thing to work so by becomin- coming across incredibly belligerent and doing all this stuff he actually did in fact get saddam to finally cooperate like [lipsmack] that would be an amazingly clever huh you know 

113.80 121.27 A: that would be really clever i hadn't even thought of that but ah you know conspiracy theories are constantly going through my head and that's that's 

118.29 118.99 B: [noise] 

120.87 127.94 B: yeah no one's willing to think that he's that clever but [laughter] you know it's like you know he he could be that clever and he's certainly surrounded by a lot of very clever people 

127.03 132.52 A: he's surrounded by clever people definitely and i some of them i wouldn't you know that would 

132.88 134.50 A: seem like a possibility 

135.08 136.30 A: [lipsmack] um 

135.09 137.11 B: (( [lipsmack] i )) 

137.15 141.67 B: mean what do you think about about the the kind of world war two analogy i mean 

140.64 141.59 A: i i 

141.79 142.53 A: [sigh] 

143.47 151.94 A: i'm already i mean in that in that saddam is you know tyrannical and a dictator and [sigh] but at the same time i [mn] 

152.57 158.88 A: i i guess i'm i'm sort of in the same position i don't know i go back and forth you know i think he is a threat 

158.90 162.87 A: to his people and possibly to the rest of the world but i just 

163.00 163.78 A: [sigh] 

164.37 170.25 A: i'm kind of an advocate for peace and i you know what war to be the last 

171.12 173.90 A: the last resort definitely 

173.91 182.90 B: yeah and i'm definitely in the kind of good situation where where you know my kids are too old to go to war and my grandkids are too young so you know it's like [laughter] like you know 

182.26 186.84 A: i'm i'm just at the age where i could go to war so [mn] 

187.44 191.88 A: and my sister's in the army and and i i know a lot of people [sigh] 

193.05 196.98 A: you know that if they did start a draft or something like that again that could go 

197.32 198.28 A: but 

198.78 204.85 A: and i think people our age have also forgotten about vietnam even at least my age i'm 

204.89 206.75 A: i'm twenty three so 

206.27 207.88 B: (( yeah )) 

207.90 210.47 A: i know about it my dad was in it but [sigh] 

211.19 212.64 A: it's so horrific 

214.52 215.73 B: yeah an- 

215.24 224.19 A: and do you think do you think it's a ploy about uh bush trying to cover up the econ- the or trying to avoid the failing economy issue 

215.95 217.70 B: (( and )) 

224.41 228.55 B: th- i i really don't i mean you know i i 

229.22 233.87 B: i mean it's kind of it's kind of strange how you know i [laughter] it's one of the things that [mn] 

234.14 237.38 B: you you become a little bit more sanguine with age in terms of 

237.26 238.06 B: (( you know )) 

237.89 248.27 B: ah taking things more at face value i guess and y- you know what i i honestly think he's a sincere person and i think he really when he talks about evil you know which is 

248.06 260.73 B: it's a strange thing you don't you know people don't talk about evil anymore i mean even people that are nominally religious don't seem to think about evil and i actually think that that that he actually believes there is evil in the world 

260.57 265.19 B: and that ah it's it's part of ah a sense of of 

265.21 267.91 B: so- something we should do to root it out you know 

267.18 270.09 A: but i feel like his com- his 

270.13 272.81 A: you know just stamping that on 

273.73 284.06 A: evil the word evil [mn] not only does it bring up connotations of religion which is like the last thing we need right now we don't need any more associations with [sigh] 

285.11 290.32 A: we don't want to pin them as muslims and us as christians and that's i think that's a huge mistake and that's 

290.45 291.39 A: that's 

291.47 293.99 A: ah stirring it up even more 

294.40 296.17 A: stirring up all the heat and the 

297.04 301.72 A: [sigh] us versus them and driving even a a bigger risk 

298.02 298.73 B: (( [lipsmack] i )) 

298.89 300.32 B: guess it just goes to 

302.87 306.29 B: yeah i guess i think of it just in terms o- of more 

306.43 314.04 B: you know wh- why i think he that you know he's not doing this as a ploy ah although i i clearly have 

314.15 328.89 B: you know several friends who are are you know kind of totally skeptical about you know anything bush says and i think ah you know wh- i- almost in their eyes he can do no right so i suppose it's ah they're kind of you know so far one way it's it's hard 

329.01 331.52 B: (( to to form a an opinion )) 

330.55 338.89 A: well sure it's the evil thing he also doesn't [sigh] you know his his background hasn't he's never had any experience with any kind of foreign policy he doesn't know anything about it 

338.92 339.93 A: so 

340.32 342.92 A: and he sees things in black and white when he doesn't 

343.24 352.69 A: know personally first hand things about like w- with big business he can see shades of gray all over the place that's what his background is in 

353.10 354.25 A: but 

354.59 357.30 A: [noise] with foreign policy and and 

354.79 355.35 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

355.38 356.10 B: (( [lipsmack] [lipsmack] )) 

358.10 360.63 A: this situation in particular he doesn't [mn] 

361.28 362.78 A: have a more [mn] 

363.49 365.24 A: definite stance 

365.40 371.81 B: yeah but i mean he also has an incredibly experienced foreign policy team i mean you know ah 

371.30 373.19 A: behind him okay 

372.55 385.32 B: right and you know i i also think that even though ah they talk a lot about how disciplined you know his whole operation is and people tend to speak with one voice i think if if 

385.48 393.79 B: if this was really you know ah a shell game if if you know i just find it hard to believe there wouldn't be somebody like you know 

393.77 408.72 B: ah you know barrigan who basically would blow the whistle on this i mean you know it's it the experience of vietnam i mean i think a lot of people realized that you know it's not moral to kind of cover up something th- the kind of big lie that was going on and it and it was a 

397.35 398.22 A: (( uh-huh )) 

407.77 408.68 A: (( uh-huh )) 

408.67 419.27 B: very hard thing when those people broke those kind of stories i mean they were accused of being unpatriotic an- and much worse [mn] an- but 'cause they did that today 

416.34 417.19 A: right 

419.59 421.85 B: you know the climate's a little different and so 

421.88 431.70 B: ah if there really was if this was g- you know in some sense a giant sham i just don't think he'd get away with you know that there'd be people probably at pretty high levels 

431.53 441.23 B: that would would basically kind of go for your conscience and say look i i just can't keep quiet about what's happening here and there seems to be enough difference of opinion 

441.19 447.35 B: in different parts of the administration between you know kind of the the more hawkish and and the more 

447.36 449.11 B: you know not so much 

449.25 458.86 B: dovish but say the more you know careful or procedural voices coming out of the state department that i think that ah if if something if if this was 

458.65 464.30 B: no truth to it at all if these things were completely fabricated a- and the other thing is 

464.09 478.31 B: there's evidence that they weren't completely fabricated i mean you know not at but clearly you know iraq you know many years ago said we don't have anything ah any weapons and people you know found them so you know they they their track record's not great 

466.66 467.64 A: mhm 

475.52 476.44 A: mhm 

479.14 479.70 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

480.09 482.22 A: i r- i don't i don't really have 

482.37 488.21 A: [sigh] it's really hard to say i i wouldn't want to be [laughter] in their position right now having to make these decisions definitely 

488.41 489.46 A: but um 

489.55 495.54 B: yeah did you did you see any of the ah specials that were out on the cuban missile crisis ah 

494.86 495.58 A: no 

495.69 497.72 B: there were a couple on the anniversary 

497.93 502.33 B: (( you know ah you know that that that were on t._v. and )) 

501.53 504.27 A: what are they what were they saying about that 

504.32 509.21 B: recordings released and i guess the the kind of fascinating thing about it is that ah 

509.66 513.11 B: there was a lot of difference of opinion about what to do 

513.32 515.61 B: you know much more than i would have thought 

515.39 516.43 A: mhm 

516.19 523.81 B: in fact it was the president who actually did make you know kind of ah the final call i mean you i mean i i suppose that's 

524.29 532.21 B: the buck does stop there but you kind of think with [noise] with all those people and all that advice you know there must be some consensus that forms 

532.99 536.29 B: he just ratifies it and and in fact ah you know 

536.60 550.33 B: i- th- th- the kind of thread that that or the image that or impression that came through was that most of his advisors were advocating a much more aggressive stance that they really wanted to 

550.26 552.74 B: you know attack the missile installations 

552.41 553.42 A: mhm 

553.27 564.41 B: so by by going with the blockade he took this much more ah cautious approach and that and that looking back on it everybody says gee that was really a good thing to do 

564.22 565.81 A: (( yeah thank god )) 

565.05 565.86 B: so 

566.45 576.11 B: so in some sense th- the you know a very similar situation is playing out in our times and i guess forty years from now people will look back on it and ah you know make the call 

577.73 578.66 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

581.33 583.77 A: do you think that if we 

583.84 588.71 A: do go to war that's going to bolster the economy or be detrimental 

591.11 592.68 B: [mn] well probably both 

591.93 602.74 A: because in the past it's been good but now wars are just so expensive as far you know just million millions millions of dollars onto the bomb that we just drop and we you know 

602.88 604.62 A: however many thousands of them 

602.94 603.80 B: (( b- yeah i )) 

604.78 617.64 B: i must confess i feel like gee here i'm a well educated person and everything like that but th- the whole economy thing is often a mystery to me like apparently it's a very good for the economy if everybody were to go out and buy a new car tomorrow and throw away their old one 

617.56 618.49 A: mhm 

617.70 622.94 B: right and that seems an awful lot like dropping bombs [laughter] you know on some we 

622.02 622.88 A: [laughter] 

622.95 637.40 B: built all the bombs and the government pays for it but well actually we're the government so we're buying them from ourselves and throwing them away and somehow that makes everything good and it it does seem like there's even though that that's on the surface kind of ludicrous there's some of that going in all 

637.33 640.91 B: right in terms of ah you know what happened you know 

641.38 646.83 B: after the various wars in terms of you know world war two there was just such an outpouring of productivity 

647.23 653.44 B: but ah you know i mean what happened with the last war is that you know in kuwait was that you know 

653.51 664.48 B: ah you know things were bad for a little while and then ah quickly got better in fact you know the the last ten great years of the nineties kind of came after that war so 

664.10 665.47 A: mhm 

665.75 675.52 B: you know it seems kind of awful though to think that ah you know to to wish that th- that almost it's awful that anything good comes out of that much destruction 

675.00 676.85 A: right and we don't even want to [mn] 

676.87 679.67 A: you know speak about what could happen 

679.99 680.76 B: (( right )) 

680.49 688.54 A: just like you know us having control of the oil fields possibly if you know we did go in and wipe out everybody over there [laughter] but 

688.60 690.14 B: (( but )) 

690.17 697.17 A: [sigh] which has also crossed my mind you know a lot of people's minds i'm sure that's another conspiracy theory but 

694.33 695.65 B: (( yeah i mean that [noise] )) 

696.78 710.36 B: i r- i was- i read some article that said that you know the war is not just a big expense it's the rebuilding of iraq that would be a huge expense but because iraq is so wealthy in terms of the 

710.29 717.98 B: oil wealth in the country that the country really you know could more that easily you know rebuild itself if only it were given the chance of it ah 

718.36 719.13 B: (( you know ))
