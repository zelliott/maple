0.27 1.48 B: hi 

1.12 2.26 A: hi 

2.30 3.84 B: my name is stephanie 

3.70 4.82 A: i'm mitch 

4.84 5.84 B: how're you 

5.69 11.88 A: i'm good yeah i don't know what do you think i guess 

6.49 8.30 B: okay so the topic 

12.03 23.16 A: i guess i don't really think it it's doing any good i i don't know why we're messing around with iraq and um i i i don't think that arms inspections are going to help at all 

23.30 26.53 A: i mean 'cause obviously they're gonna hide anything good that they have 

26.61 27.80 B: right well 

28.29 33.31 B: i'm kind of torn with it i'm a little bit i i agree that we need to be doing something 

30.42 35.18 A: mhm 

33.58 37.19 B: but i don't know what exactly we need to be doing 

36.92 38.48 A: yeah 

38.29 39.01 B: (( um )) 

39.69 40.44 B: i 

40.77 49.14 B: i support it because i mean it's better than doing nothing i suppose and at least we're showing that we're doing something to iraq 

45.88 49.17 A: mhm 

49.70 52.22 A: why do you think that we need to do something 

53.74 59.87 B: b- because i think at this point especially we've already started to make a stand and if we pull out now 

59.58 61.17 A: yeah i suppose 

60.58 70.85 B: we end up looking like a weak country and with already knowing that we've been attacked once and people are willing to attack the united states 

71.03 72.33 B: we have to do 

72.58 74.39 B: something at the very least 

75.05 76.31 B: not to mention 

76.89 79.63 B: i'm a little bit more liberal when it comes to 

76.94 79.30 A: mhm 

79.95 81.58 B: doing something [laughter] 

81.02 82.84 A: yeah 

82.93 86.97 A: do y- do you think that the arms inspections are going to help at all though 

88.36 95.84 B: [lipsmack] um the the only reason i think it may help is just to make sure they realize that we're always there 

96.03 96.98 A: uh-huh 

96.40 98.58 B: it's someone always looking over their shoulder 

98.91 102.60 B: and it's going to make it a little bit more difficult for them to 

103.52 106.60 B: do something to us hopefully 

104.37 108.26 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

107.15 109.66 B: that it's one step in the right direction 

109.36 111.13 A: (( mhm )) 

110.48 112.78 B: that's my perspective i mean [mn] 

112.48 114.95 A: i guess i don't really feel like th- 

114.96 119.72 A: that would help in in terrorism and all on us i think terrorists are going to 

119.82 121.36 A: be around no matter 

121.48 126.50 A: if iraq is helping them or not and i just feel we're giving the rest of the 

123.67 124.83 B: (( so do y- )) 

126.82 132.65 A: rest of the international community are kind of mad at us 'cause no one else is really supporting us on it 

133.77 140.45 A: but you know i'm not a big fan of hussein or anything but [laughter] 

138.59 144.36 B: right [laughter] well what do yo- what do you think we should be doing then if 

141.87 143.14 A: (( i )) 

144.56 148.32 A: don't know if we should be doing anything in in iraq um 

148.93 158.37 A: i i don't know if there's anything we can do really i mean that's kind of the whole point of terrorism is that it just takes one guy and you know household supplies to make 

151.45 152.60 B: right 

159.27 160.65 A: wreak havoc 

161.16 164.51 A: you know and build a bomb or something like that but 

163.92 164.73 B: true 

165.89 169.33 A: i i think that terrorism is going to be the biggest problem for us 

169.51 170.69 A: from now on 

170.90 176.53 A: you know since there's no one else there's no other super powers no one else like that we have to worry about 

177.72 180.81 A: i just hope it doesn't get to the point where we're like israel 

180.70 193.09 B: right i completely agree with that one [laughter] that's the only reason i think i'm willing to do anything is to prevent us from having to live i mean i don't want my kids when i have kids [mn] to have to live every day in fear 

182.95 183.95 A: [laughter] 

187.30 189.39 A: (( yeah )) 

193.38 196.31 B: because that's not the reason 

196.90 199.04 B: that we should be living [laughter] 

198.65 199.94 A: right 

202.10 203.48 B: (( um w- do yo- um )) 

203.87 208.44 B: do you think there's something we should be doing in the united states then besides you know just going over to iraq 

208.88 213.38 B: like should we be taking better precautions in the united states for terrorism or 

209.09 210.17 A: (( uh )) 

213.32 217.44 A: i don- i don't think so i just don't think there's anything that you can do 

218.03 222.74 A: you know i guess it doesn't hurt airport security and things like that but i don't like 

223.12 227.37 A: i i'm not a big fan of the new homeland security 

227.44 234.92 A: office of homeland security or anything like that i i think that we're starting to give up a lot of our personal freedom 

234.87 235.88 B: right 

235.54 239.11 A: in the name of security and things like that you know like they can 

239.42 245.04 A: subpoena records from the library and [lipsmack] all sorts of things like that that i don't really agree with 

245.09 249.60 B: yeah i would agree on that aspect i'm not a big fan of having 

247.68 248.91 A: yeah 

249.91 251.38 B: my privacy 

251.61 253.08 A: (( right )) 

251.70 253.24 B: (( stepped on [noise] )) 

253.11 261.69 A: mhm and it's to the point now where you know computers are fast enough and people can write code to figure these things out where they can churn through the data fast enough 

261.35 262.35 B: right 

263.59 265.25 A: but 

270.20 272.98 A: so ah how did you hear about the study 

272.06 275.84 B: [noise] um through one of my professors at northern 

276.69 277.76 A: northern 

277.04 278.70 B: out in illinois 

278.03 278.72 A: (( where )) 

278.84 279.95 A: oh okay 

279.56 280.54 B: [laughter] 

281.26 283.04 A: i'm in minnesota 

282.50 283.77 B: oh okay 

284.33 285.82 B: quite a distance 

285.74 287.01 A: yeah 

288.31 290.53 A: are you a linguistics student or something 

290.58 294.79 B: [mn] um i am ah english education masters student 

294.56 295.54 A: (( oh okay )) 

296.63 297.75 B: for the time being 

297.98 298.90 A: [laughter] 

299.00 300.09 B: [laughter] 

300.56 302.32 A: what do you want to do teach 

301.67 304.83 B: um i'm actually are going to go back and teach high school 

304.79 305.82 A: oh okay 

305.75 311.15 B: because it didn't quite work out as i had planned [laughter] i wanted to be a professor but it's 

310.65 311.56 A: (( uh-huh )) 

311.42 313.43 B: (( not going to happen how about you )) 

312.59 317.82 A: yeah uh well i- i'm working on my masters degree in computer science 

317.97 319.14 B: (( oh okay mhm )) 

318.51 327.99 A: um i participated in an earlier study the switchboard one so that's how i heard about it a- i was into linguistics for a while 

327.73 328.76 B: oh okay 

329.76 330.72 B: (( yeah i've )) 

331.17 333.30 B: never taken a linguistics class 

333.06 334.52 A: you should 

333.63 335.82 B: but next year i need to start taking em but 

335.71 337.17 A: yeah 

336.83 338.88 B: ah right now i'm just trying to hope i can actually 

339.06 341.25 B: get through the classes i'm in now 

340.21 341.58 A: [laughter] 

341.68 342.95 B: (( [laughter] )) 

343.55 346.36 A: how much do you have left on your masters degree oh 

345.09 347.51 B: um this is my first semester 

347.56 349.92 A: okay 

347.57 351.48 B: it's going to take me three years 'cause i have to do student teaching for 

351.51 355.71 B: getting my teaching certification so i'm going to be in school forever again [laughter] 

352.85 353.92 A: uh-huh 

354.53 356.07 A: (( yeah )) 

356.70 357.55 B: i'm ready to 

356.78 359.30 A: are you going full time 

358.21 361.19 B: yes yeah and i'm teaching up at northern too so 

361.10 362.06 A: (( oh okay )) 

363.82 369.48 A: i'm going part time i just take one class a semester so it'll take me even longer [laughter] 

369.09 369.93 B: true 

369.78 375.30 A: i i i don't know how long it's going to take actually i was thinking of switching and taking two this semester 

375.35 378.29 A: 'cause i- i'm working full time um 

378.49 380.33 A: my company's paying for it 

380.31 381.78 B: (( [noise] oh okay yeah )) 

380.90 384.41 A: but you know two a semester i think that might be too much work 

384.58 392.28 A: but at the rate of like one a semester it's going take me i don't know five or six years or something ridiculous like that just to get a masters degree 

392.09 393.02 B: wow 

392.96 394.25 A: yeah [laughter] 

396.02 399.90 A: but i figure since it's paid for i might as well keep taking courses 

399.54 406.58 B: [noise] yeah that's that's the way to do it that's why i'm teaching up at northern 'cause i don't have to pay for classes then [laughter] 

405.94 408.43 A: oh yeah yeah 

407.47 410.73 B: but they don't pay me enough to quite ah [laughter] feed myself 

410.53 411.63 A: [laughter] 

411.49 412.51 B: [laughter] 

413.45 417.24 A: so you teach like like freshman courses or 

416.02 417.76 B: freshman composition 

417.41 418.34 A: uh-huh 

418.58 422.56 B: so they're fun i think that's the best part of sc- about school though [laughter] 

422.17 423.11 A: uh-huh 

422.78 424.06 B: is my kids 

425.75 429.15 B: but i don't know i might end up leaving the program after this year 

428.95 430.78 A: yeah 

429.77 431.19 B: we'll see [laughter] 

430.81 431.65 A: (( well )) 

433.22 435.35 A: it's good to know how you feel though 

435.70 439.60 A: you know you can take the courses and decide you don't like it and you're not 

439.00 442.55 B: [laughter] right that way i tried and i can't ever look back and be like well [laughter] 

442.16 444.00 A: (( yeah )) 

442.63 443.97 B: maybe i should've 

446.98 451.72 A: so you- in your composition class do you have to grade like essays and things like that 

451.11 452.34 B: yeah 

451.79 454.70 A: does it take a long time i had a friend who was 

453.23 462.34 B: oh my god yeah it's insane well on wednesday they're handing in their portfolios so i'm going to have sixty six papers for i only teach one class this semester 

462.01 462.92 A: uh-huh 

462.45 465.43 B: but i'm going to have sixty six papers to read in two days [laughter] 

465.08 466.45 A: yeah that- 

466.61 472.78 A: that- my friend who was a t._a. for the composition class said it took him at least an hour to grade each paper 

473.00 476.26 A: you know and [laughter] at that rate that- that'll take you forever 

476.57 478.62 A: but 

478.21 479.95 B: (( yeah to say the very least [sigh] )) 

480.41 483.42 A: what sort of things are they writing about 

483.95 484.99 B: (( um )) 

486.77 488.79 B: let's see they had to write about 

488.83 493.30 B: their family for one of th- their first paper and then they had to write about the media 

493.35 494.67 A: mhm 

493.77 498.39 B: and how they think the media affects stereotypes 

499.52 502.30 B: [lipsmack] and the last paper was on the movie l._a. confidential 

502.33 503.14 A: oh 

503.31 506.84 B: so th- that was i think the the best paper they wrote on 

506.67 507.73 A: uh-huh 

507.17 509.78 B: everything else has just been [laughter] horrible 

509.19 514.02 A: [laughter] yes i bet i was going to ask of- about the quality of papers you get in 

514.02 517.96 B: yeah it's disturbing it's very disturbing i mean my grammar 

515.33 516.56 A: [laughter] 

518.50 528.16 B: i'll admit it isn't great but oh my goodness i mean it- this the computer age has like ruined all of our possibilities for writing 

520.00 520.88 A: uh-huh 

527.81 528.82 A: [laughter] 

528.46 533.81 B: because i get papers where students instead of writing out the word y. o. u. they just put the letter u 

533.75 535.10 A: oh really 

534.71 538.63 B: and they don't understand that that's not academic writing [laughter] 

538.34 539.51 A: wow 

539.24 541.32 B: it's really bad 

541.93 543.62 B: worse than i ever expected 

541.93 544.31 A: wow i didn't think it'd be that bad 

544.00 545.48 B: yeah it gets bad 

545.17 547.78 A: you get things that aren't sentences and 

547.18 557.08 B: oh yeah [noise] just and you know really bad slang that i don't know what the words mean i'm only twenty two but i've suddenly gotten old in a matter of a couple of years [laughter] 

552.87 555.67 A: [laughter] 

556.50 557.49 A: uh-huh 

557.32 560.09 B: because i have no clue [noise] what some of the they're saying ah mean 

559.91 564.61 A: yeah so are there a lot of apostrophes floating round where there shouldn't be 

564.00 565.39 B: mhm 

564.72 566.13 A: yeah 

565.69 567.89 B: yeah it's bad [laughter] 

566.95 568.21 A: (( [laughter] )) 

571.15 582.38 A: yeah i i noticed that like when i was in college as an undergrad that y- i think if you can write well you can do well in pretty much any class because no one else knows how to write it's 

580.95 582.03 B: uh-huh 

583.21 587.59 B: oh yeah yeah i- i think that's that's what i'm trying to teach my students 

586.80 589.86 A: mhm 

587.70 589.84 B: i don't quite teach them the way 

592.07 594.93 B: um [mn] my professors taught me they always said you know 

595.08 600.42 B: make sure you know all the material and i'm trying to teach my students that if you can write you can get through anything 

600.19 601.09 A: yup 

600.72 601.73 B: [laughter] 

602.48 605.15 A: you either have to study or know how to write 

604.58 605.58 B: (( right )) 

605.17 609.94 A: so it's worth your time to learn how to write 

606.72 609.17 B: if you can't do either [laughter] you're in trouble [laughter] 

610.07 612.71 B: leave now and go find a really good paying job [laughter] 

611.56 613.95 A: yeah 

612.99 614.27 B: find something 

616.73 618.53 B: they're getting better though so 

617.77 620.55 A: (( right )) 

618.71 622.24 B: i i don't think i'm failing any more than one person so that's always good 

621.66 623.91 A: [laughter] yeah that's good [noise] 

624.13 626.03 A: what was your undergraduate degree in 

626.54 630.67 B: my undergrad was in english literature and philosophy 

630.67 631.61 A: oh 

631.31 632.33 B: (( how about you )) 

632.65 633.78 A: mathematics 

633.56 635.52 B: mathematics ooh 

635.31 636.62 A: [laughter] 

636.69 639.43 A: i'm honored in linguistics and computer science 

639.89 648.59 A: i was actually going to switch to linguistics at one point but i i was in the technical college or the i don't know i._t. i guess 

645.68 646.50 B: mhm 

648.60 655.50 A: not the liberal arts college and so i'd taken physics and chemistry and things like that but no foreign language 

655.49 656.27 B: okay 

655.52 665.43 A: because there wasn't a requirement and to switch to linguistics which is in the liberal arts school you need like three years of a foreign language so it would've pushed me way back 

662.86 663.93 B: right 

665.78 667.42 B: yeah that would be enough to 

667.12 672.58 A: so i stuck with mathematics even though i didn't really like it toward the end but [laughter] 

671.75 672.62 B: [laughter] 

673.22 675.36 A: i figured it's better to just get out of 

675.23 677.64 B: right yeah you don't want to spend 

677.81 679.81 B: ten years as your undergrad [laughter] 

678.21 681.17 A: there yeah right 

681.35 682.81 B: might as well get out there 

683.87 687.97 B: yeah i think i got o- got out of college with only taking half a semester of math 

688.01 692.31 A: oh yeah the one requirement what'd you take 

688.53 689.89 B: [laughter] 

692.51 695.25 B: it was math for public discourse 

695.82 699.07 B: and it wasn't even required 'cause i ended up transferring schools 

698.78 700.09 A: (( uh-huh [lipsmack] )) 

699.31 702.53 B: [laughter] so it didn't even count towards my 

702.36 703.30 A: oh 

702.65 704.99 B: credits and then i took logic 

705.05 708.05 A: logic that's a- a lot of people take logic here too 

708.52 712.24 B: logic logic was a lot of fun but it was for my philosophy degree too 

711.50 714.15 A: mhm 

712.30 713.71 B: so it all worked out [mn] 

716.31 719.89 A: yeah i i didn't take logic but i thought about taking it it
