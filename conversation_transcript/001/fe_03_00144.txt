61.18 62.26 A: i uh yeah you are right 

66.61 67.83 A: f- i- i- it is frightening 

68.26 75.87 B: well they way they have it set it up is uh you know they assume that there are weapons there so even if the inspectors don't find any weapons they will assume that they have been hidden 

76.45 76.75 A: right 

76.99 78.66 B: and so it is it is a done deal 

79.73 80.51 B: it is really ridiculous 

79.77 80.08 A: right 

81.40 81.90 A: yeah 

82.53 85.34 A: that's um i mean i i really think the exact same thing 

87.38 89.09 A: i can't i still can't figure out 

90.42 92.81 A: you know after that that first war 

93.01 95.13 A: if they left him in power then you know 

96.47 97.12 A: so be it 

97.80 98.51 A: and you know

102.78 105.64 A: i don't really care if he has weapons of mass destruction 

107.19 108.60 A: every other country seems to 

109.18 109.48 B: right 

109.96 112.08 B: and you know it (( )) 

113.78 114.34 A: (( quite )) right 

116.42 116.83 A: yeah 

117.51 118.01 A: and 

118.37 120.98 A: i mean i have to admit i have been a little bit lazy about 

123.61 125.31 A: i mean i i do read some articles 

127.83 129.00 A: i just don't i i think it is 

136.84 137.72 B: the regular people 

143.06 143.59 B: i agree 

143.76 145.67 B: i agree and i th- you know out here in oklahoma 

146.19 148.40 B: it's very conservative and so you can't really 

148.87 151.57 B: express opinions like this freely 

151.17 151.79 A: yeah 

151.96 156.79 B: everyone is you know very pro-government and p- pro-military it's a very military area 

156.98 157.39 A: really 

157.60 158.17 B: there is a 

158.33 160.00 B: air force bases everywhere you look 

160.22 161.41 A: oh o._k. 

160.87 161.88 B: and uh yeah 

162.11 162.86 B: so we have 

163.12 163.55 B: um 

163.93 166.45 B: (( )) air force base and (( )) air force base 

167.00 168.24 B: nearly ever major city 

168.65 169.93 B: is hooked up with the military 

169.92 172.71 A: oh o._k. i didn't i i i didn't know that 

173.49 175.72 B: and so it's a very you know different viewpoint that 

177.09 177.35 B: there is 

177.50 180.17 B: very few people like you out here 

179.22 179.84 A: right huh 

180.27 182.70 B: and so i'm kind of relieved to hear someone who 

182.34 182.71 A: huh 

183.28 184.45 B: that is somewhat in agreement 

185.13 185.73 A: yeah 

185.16 186.59 B: i just think it is ridiculous 

187.76 190.46 A: yeah i mean i i don't think it is like it it it 

191.36 192.60 A: i mean (( we are )) that only 

192.93 195.90 A: we are that the i also think it is like it it it's 

197.29 198.22 A: creating this 

198.36 199.12 A: horrible 

199.85 200.35 A: bad 

201.31 203.35 A: ill will in the middle east towards 

203.62 204.59 A: you know this country 

205.12 205.41 B: yes 

205.69 207.86 A: as far i mean that is just my own opinion but 

208.70 209.99 B: it's not at all diplomatic 

208.84 209.30 A: um 

210.40 212.49 A: yeah and you know it's like it you know 

212.69 216.56 A: at the same time they seem to be antagonizing our the our you know 

217.36 218.22 A: our supposed 

218.54 223.23 A: allies over there as well and you know it just creates difficulty for everyone over there 

224.06 224.94 B: and the u._n. 

225.08 228.16 B: you know i think it is completely disregarding the u._n. as a major 

228.98 229.94 B: power in the world 

229.08 229.46 A: yeah 

230.10 230.46 A: right 

230.69 234.44 B: and what is it there for if we are not going to follow the recommendations 

233.01 233.43 A: right 

233.88 240.07 A: exactly i mean you know if it and it sets a lousy precedent if they say oh well you know the u._s. can 

242.25 247.17 A: not comply with whatever it is the u._n. you know is doing at a certain time well who is to 

247.46 248.59 A: stop anyone else then 

249.03 250.32 B: right and i think that 

250.61 252.94 B: to me i see that as the big issue as 

253.39 257.07 B: you know destabilize the entire world why should anyone 

257.58 258.52 B: follow these rules 

261.33 263.61 B: well hell you know the world is going to hell in a hand basket 

264.00 264.58 A: true 

265.57 266.99 B: yeah you know i i don't know i just 

268.19 269.58 B: the older i get the more i i 

270.00 275.49 B: think like that and i think oh maybe this is a normal part of aging you know like young people who are eighteen years old 

275.85 277.38 B: they really don't think like that 

277.50 279.28 B: maybe it just this is middle age 

277.55 277.92 A: right 

280.09 281.97 B: to think you know how terrible it all is 

283.33 285.36 A: yeah i don't know though i mean well 

286.23 287.20 A: i don't know i'm i'm 

287.32 288.98 A: i'm thirty nine so 

290.01 290.52 A: uh 

291.53 294.23 B: yeah i'm thirty five so i mean i am not that old but 

292.52 292.98 A: o._k. 

294.96 296.16 B: so i am feeling older 

296.28 296.64 B: as 

296.50 296.93 A: yeah 

296.94 298.37 B: as each year passes 

299.78 300.46 A: oh yeah 

300.56 304.26 A: yeah i mean i grew up with the vietnam war to a certain degree 

305.09 307.02 A: and i i can't put concrete 

307.44 307.98 A: um 

308.92 311.94 A: you know i don't know i remember watching the news 

312.45 314.96 A: the nightly news as a child and you know like 

315.45 317.27 A: the body counts and things like that 

318.55 319.27 A: and uh 

322.35 323.73 A: you know so i guess it wasn't 

324.80 327.69 B: oh yeah i i i think i am very anti-war and i have always been 

327.87 328.45 A: yeah 

328.64 329.28 B: and uh 

329.59 330.85 B: like the afghanistan 

331.41 331.88 B: deal 

331.52 333.20 A: oh that's just completely ridiculous 

335.60 340.07 B: it was very disturbing the idea of all the sort of everyday people just being bombed 

340.53 340.87 A: yeah 

341.38 342.24 A: and i mean 

343.38 343.90 A: you know 

344.19 345.77 A: i understand you know i 

347.37 350.43 A: you know i understand you have to do something you know you can't blow up 

350.58 352.02 A: you know i mean you can't blow up 

352.48 353.97 A: buildings in a in a in 

357.70 359.88 A: i don't think that they really you know they didn't even catch him 

360.45 360.78 B: right 

360.94 362.05 B: there was nothing accomplished 

362.45 367.48 A: what did they accomplished and you know and now we are hearing oh yeah you know al qaeda has uh regrouped 

368.02 370.12 A: you know i i personally think it is just like some 

370.86 375.23 A: i mean i was saying that i think uh (( osama bin laden )) 

376.23 383.26 A: is really you know some guy who is living in mexico or somewhere like that you know and they they pull him out whenever they 

383.59 384.82 A: they need a sound bite 

385.08 385.66 A: you know but 

386.28 388.08 A: but it is just a big farce i mean 

389.31 392.86 A: i don't know i m- you know i i hate to say i have become that cynical 

393.65 395.13 B: (( )) it could be it could be 

394.54 398.09 A: but i think i am i really think i am that cynical 

399.11 402.97 A: you know i mean i did get and i got caught up in the emotion after all that too 

403.70 404.08 A: um 

404.83 406.65 A: but you know six months later 

407.35 408.92 A: you know i am singing a different song 

411.24 412.53 A: you know not that it wasn't awful 

416.76 418.68 B: oh i i think it was a terrible 

419.70 422.78 B: move i mean it was it didn't accomplish anything he is not caught 

423.53 423.81 A: fine 

429.98 432.59 A: supposedly bomb like what are you doing what why are we like 

432.82 436.42 A: concentrating on iraq now i thought i thought it was a war on terror 

437.19 439.37 B: right i it's just a diversionary tactic 

439.40 439.80 A: yeah 

440.62 441.26 A: so you know 

441.75 449.15 A: say how much you f- and they are not doing any- oh from what i have been reading you know they are they are backing off in afghanistan now and you know the the 

449.98 450.36 A: uh 

450.70 454.24 A: you know now whether they are doing that because i know historically 

454.61 456.77 A: i mean afghanistan has got to be 

457.03 458.56 A: you know that is a tough country 

459.48 460.16 B: very tough 

459.60 463.50 A: you know inhospitable landscape and you know i mean if the russians couldn't 

464.03 466.39 A: you know subdue it and they went all out 

476.48 479.26 B: i don't know either i don't know if they really believed that they could do it 

479.75 480.70 B: or if they just 

480.83 482.80 B: though well we have got to make a good show of it 

482.93 483.37 A: yeah 

483.81 484.49 A: that is true 

486.06 489.74 A: because i didn't really see the connection between the normal afghanis and 

495.04 496.11 A: i i really don't under- 

502.04 502.92 A: family feud 

505.91 511.55 B: right and i i i i listened to something on the radio about it and they this washington insider said that 

512.05 513.89 B: you know for the last ten years there has 

513.99 514.42 B: been this 

514.55 516.03 B: desire to get rid of 

516.49 519.22 B: (( saddam )) so to the outside world it looks like a brand new 

519.53 520.81 B: infatuation but 

521.37 522.94 B: the people there in place have been 

523.16 525.80 B: really gunning for (( )) all along 

528.30 531.52 B: and there is really no seemingly con- you know concern about 

532.26 533.37 B: the everyday person it's 

534.13 534.65 A: right 

534.70 536.90 B: and it (( )) you know how will the country be run 

537.57 537.92 A: right 

537.97 539.58 B: after you go in and bomb it to 

542.01 542.46 A: yeah 

543.08 548.50 A: yeah i mean in the the other you know um how will the country be r- i read i did read an article this morning 

561.96 564.91 B: yeah i have heard stuff like that you know like they do want to get the
