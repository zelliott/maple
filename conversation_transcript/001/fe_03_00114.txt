0.43 3.32 B: [mn] hi this is ah doug 

2.93 5.11 A: hi i'm corey 

5.03 9.53 B: ah so what do you think we should do about iraq 

8.89 11.19 A: i don't know that's a tough one [laughter] 

10.96 13.62 B: (( isn't it ah [lipsmack] )) 

13.92 28.23 B: we had a congressional candidate come through town who asked this question to an audience full of people asking do you believe we should intervene militarily [sigh] and got a confused response 

29.48 32.79 A: i guess i would say that's kind of where i'm at i don't 

29.55 30.82 B: and 

31.91 35.30 B: yeah so then she rephrased the question 

35.64 40.69 B: she rephrased it saying well suppose that the u._n. inspectors go in [mn] 

42.14 43.34 B: and then 

44.96 48.38 B: they get rebuffed what should be do militarily 

47.77 48.77 A: (( [sigh] )) 

50.49 52.65 A: that's almost harder [laughter] 

52.11 56.47 B: well that's because now the u._n. inspectors are there 

56.22 57.40 A: yeah 

56.82 58.27 B: isn't it different 

58.29 63.34 B: ah she asked this question ah what was it a month and a half ago 

62.84 64.22 A: mhm 

63.57 70.94 B: and at that time people said well if we get rebuffed we should just go in that's that's the time to respond militarily 

71.01 74.91 B: and ah i wonder if people would change their mind 

75.14 85.80 A: so far it it sounds like and you never know because you never know what spin the media's got and you know where they're getting their information from but it sounds like 

85.88 89.26 A: so far they have cooperated and they've done everything 

89.56 91.19 A: that's been asked of em 

91.06 93.36 B: [mn] i'm just amazed by the 

93.51 98.60 B: how many thousand pages and how many cdroms of documents they've turned over 

98.60 100.47 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

99.77 103.09 B: the idea that someone has to read all that 

102.80 107.87 A: well it kind of make you wonder if it's a baffle em with b._s. type thing 

107.63 108.87 B: doesn't it 

108.26 110.91 A: you know did they just 

110.90 123.58 A: you know spend you know think of how many people it would have taken they've only had what was it a month or whatever to put it all together think of how many people had to have been working on this in iraq for the past year 

117.36 118.47 B: yeah 

121.99 123.34 B: well 

123.41 131.26 B: but they've had since summer as warning i mean the u._s. decided to really start pushing hard when in august 

123.79 124.66 A: or 

131.11 132.36 A: yeah 

132.19 134.60 B: [noise] so they've had some warning 

133.98 138.94 A: that's true but i don't know if he would have started gathering documents [laughter] to support 

138.85 142.90 B: well if if they did that shows some real savvy 

139.64 141.86 A: i guess they might have but they 

142.63 143.82 A: yeah 

144.67 147.03 B: so this is an interesting puzzle 

146.41 149.92 A: yeah i i was actually impressed that saddam 

150.49 151.61 A: you know 

152.09 154.25 A: has played the game thus far 

154.45 162.82 B: i think he's he's smart enough to know that he that he should play the game because that makes any intervention look all the less just 

162.50 163.76 A: yeah 

163.06 166.92 B: i mean if he hadn't played the game intervention might have looked just [mn] 

167.92 168.79 A: yeah 

167.97 171.27 B: and so it it's a it's a challenge 

171.29 172.53 A: yeah 

173.61 174.75 B: ah 

174.16 176.59 A: and i i just hope bush doesn't 

177.60 179.81 A: doesn't decide to 

180.30 183.58 A: just decide to get frustrated with it and do it on his own 

183.00 188.13 B: well that was the editorial that i saw in today's paper that said well suppose 

188.41 191.94 B: the editorial i saw this morning said that ah 

193.21 198.53 B: [mn] said that it looks suspiciously like bush is now going to try to ah come up with a pretext 

198.73 203.07 B: to go ahead anyway and ah that's you know i i 

203.12 210.32 B: i haven't seen evidence of that but it certainly is easy to imagine if you put your pessimistic hat on that he might do that [mn] 

210.00 210.96 A: yeah 

211.99 221.72 A: yeah i know that i've seen different news shows where they're like you know why is this is all coming to light now you know why is this 

221.91 225.16 A: why is it right now all of a sudden we have to do something about it 

224.52 227.58 B: well i th- i thought it was pretty obvious 

228.00 233.03 B: the timing for the election season it distracted everybody from the economy 

230.35 231.32 A: right 

232.80 234.27 A: right which 

233.37 234.50 B: and so now 

234.61 240.71 B: now after the elections we've got ah suddenly the economic team in the administration is being fired 

240.07 241.34 A: yeah 

242.14 246.87 A: well i think that's 'cause he knows in two years he could be in real trouble if they haven't [laughter] 

246.25 247.53 B: right 

246.90 248.53 A: fixed the economy 

247.93 252.46 B: right and it- it'd be very hard to stretch the iraq mess out for two years 

252.23 258.15 A: well and even if they did financially that would just be devastating to the country i would think 

256.08 257.03 B: yeah 

257.32 266.57 B: well but and the other thing is if if there's a military in- intervention now two years from now that's when you expect an army of occupation to be unraveling at the seams 

267.28 268.29 A: that's true 

268.57 272.67 B: [mn] so you need you need something else to get people's support 

272.13 273.78 A: yeah 

274.96 276.60 A: yeah 

277.63 279.20 B: (( [mn] well )) 

279.26 280.60 B: ah 

282.45 285.08 A: it's it's an interesting time to be 

284.89 286.21 B: [laughter] 

285.90 288.48 A: to be living in the u._s. 

287.31 294.08 B: yes my my chinese students tell me that the old chinese curse may you live in interesting times isn't 

294.09 296.63 B: isn't chinese [laughter] 

295.52 296.45 A: [laughter] 

296.88 300.49 B: that's it's a fairly well invented made up curse though 

301.76 302.83 B: ah 

302.53 303.84 A: yeah 

303.34 317.57 B: well i have students who are on the who are in the reserves who are very nervous about being called up before the end of the semester and wrecking another semester to another military adventure 

317.88 321.50 A: oh yeah that would be that could be a big problem 

320.66 329.55 B: yeah one of one of them lost a semester to the gulf war and now he's still trying to finish his degree and is in danger of losing another semester to this 

329.41 332.73 A: oh when does your semester end 

332.21 333.47 B: in december 

333.39 334.19 A: okay 

333.55 336.74 B: well ah this is the last week of classes 

336.69 338.34 A: well they might make it then 

338.04 341.38 B: yeah well it looks like they will this this time around 

341.34 342.64 A: that's good 

342.05 343.37 B: but ah 

343.77 346.07 B: he was worried about that he's ah i 

346.45 349.24 B: guess he's been trained as a combat nurse 

349.67 351.13 B: so he's 

353.13 355.60 B: [mn] he's all ready for it 

355.04 357.23 A: yeah he could be in demand 

356.79 357.78 B: (( uh-huh )) 

358.33 359.91 A: where do you teach at 

359.55 361.76 B: [lipsmack] i teach at the university of iowa 

361.63 365.42 A: oh okay [laughter] i go to school at the university of iowa 

364.84 369.70 B: ah okay perhaps we were responding to the same email asking for volunteers 

369.02 371.97 A: [laughter] probably which department are you in 

371.45 373.02 B: computer science 

372.51 373.43 A: okay 

373.65 375.74 A: i'm in library science so 

375.02 382.97 B: okay ah but the the request came from dave eichmann [laughter] [sigh] ah 

378.19 380.86 A: yes [laughter] that was the one 

382.48 384.87 A: yes it's a small world [laughter] 

383.90 385.18 B: it is 

386.23 388.43 A: is this your first call 

387.87 390.18 B: yes this is my first 

389.27 390.16 A: okay 

390.29 392.10 A: this is my fourth so 

391.44 396.93 B: ah you must have volunteered to do multiple calls from multiple phones or something 

396.33 399.81 A: um just i just thought i would do as many as they needed so 

399.18 400.84 B: ah okay 

400.10 403.53 A: i signed up on friday and i've gotten called every day yeah but 

402.57 406.74 B: [laughter] okay oh i didn't sign up for any weekend calls 

407.41 408.67 B: (( okay [mn] )) 

409.50 410.98 A: it's been really interesting 

409.58 412.00 B: well yeah 

412.32 415.69 B: so what do you make of the ah the student ah 

416.35 418.32 B: the student anti war movement 

419.59 423.83 A: i guess i haven't really heard that much about it i live out of town and i'm 

423.16 424.06 B: (( ah )) 

424.01 425.67 A: finishing up for this semester 

424.17 428.47 B: you haven't walked by the paintings on the fence around the old capitol 

428.23 429.29 A: (( uh-uh )) 

428.92 432.83 B: okay there's a there there's a big stretch of fence 

432.88 438.22 B: near jessup hall that has ah that ha- that's done by the students for 

438.27 440.18 B: (( p- students for )) 

441.15 442.78 B: peace with iraq 

443.08 453.81 B: and they have painted beautiful portraits of of all o- well beautifully tongue in cheek portraits of all of the ah key players in the middle east 

453.93 459.02 B: ah bush sharon saddam arafat [mn] 

459.58 467.56 B: very nice caricatures of these people ah all of them there- there's sort of equality of insult involved in them 

467.17 468.07 A: okay 

468.04 474.69 B: [mn] but none of them are [laughter] no- no- none of them are exactly pleasant someone actually complained to the newspaper about 

474.89 480.60 B: the painting of arafat in a hawkeye football uniform waving a peace sign [laughter] 

483.17 484.23 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

483.19 485.24 B: (( they did sharon in a tutu )) 

489.10 494.44 B: ah saddam just looks like himself and bush looks sort of bush is done as a hippy [laughter] 

496.01 497.65 B: waving a peace sign 

497.41 500.83 A: [laughter] [laughter] yeah i don't know if he's as peaceful as most hippies were 

501.14 505.90 B: we- well that's the whole point i mean the- none of these portraits are exactly 

502.93 503.81 A: yeah 

505.91 506.78 B: (( ah )) 

507.09 516.48 B: honorable [laughter] it's fun political parody but it's it's evidence that there is a fairly large student group that's that's ah 

508.14 509.24 A: yeah 

511.95 512.67 A: yeah 

517.28 520.69 B: that's talking about trying to be an anti war group i don't know 

521.36 524.23 A: yeah i guess i've gotten a couple of emails that 

524.65 526.87 A: the graduate students were working 

526.65 527.93 B: mhm 

527.29 530.53 A: or were trying to form something but 

529.95 530.88 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

530.71 532.66 A: we live in muscatine so 

532.10 533.17 B: okay 

532.96 535.30 A: to to drive up for that kind of stuff is 

534.69 536.36 B: yes that's a long commute 

535.78 536.68 A: (( so )) 

537.20 538.35 A: but um 

538.16 540.35 B: [lipsmack] the pearl city 

540.16 541.84 A: yeah 

542.32 543.41 A: so 

544.95 551.20 A: it's nice to hear that they at le- there is an interest in it and that people are at least aware and care 

548.41 549.74 B: yeah 

550.14 554.52 B: yeah what really bothers me though is that they seem to have 

555.00 556.96 B: real interests 

557.78 559.59 B: but they seem to be 

560.76 562.39 B: very much 

564.57 575.46 B: their sources of information are highly biased and and they're they've decided to disbelieve everything they hear except what they hear through the anti war movement and frequently that's just as biased 

576.07 579.46 B: so they don't se- i don't see much evidence of of 

579.59 582.15 B: strong critical thinking skills there 

582.75 583.75 B: ah 

582.97 585.12 A: yeah that's a problem then [laughter] 

584.54 585.94 B: yeah 

587.12 589.97 A: but it does make it hard to know what 

590.71 593.19 A: what you should believe you know 

592.53 598.26 B: yeah well it's very clear that every source is suspect and the problem is to ah 

598.65 604.29 B: to not let that lead you to believe that everything sa- said by a suspect source is false 

604.20 605.13 A: right 

607.13 607.97 A: yeah 

607.16 611.29 B: even the greatest scoundrels tell the truth sometimes [laughter] ah 

610.75 612.53 A: yeah [laughter] that's true 

612.94 616.06 B: and in this case 

616.07 617.46 B: i'm not sure 

617.71 622.60 B: [mn] i don't i'm not really sure who the scoundrels are and who is merely deluded 

622.46 627.33 A: i was going to say that could be the biggest problem in this one is trying to figure out who the scoundrel is 

626.68 639.51 B: yeah i mean i i i'm willing to believe that saddam hussein is a scoundrel and deluded ah but the the the peace movement people are busily attempting to 

633.36 634.30 A: yeah 

639.55 642.10 B: oh i've heard charges that said that 

643.17 645.21 B: [mn] this was a ah 

646.44 655.27 B: this was a military intervention that that that was going to make money for the ah military industrial complex in the united states 

655.84 667.32 B: and [mn] the economics of that argument just strike me as very bizarre because it's very hard to find any example of a war that has actually had an- a long term economic benefit for anyone 

667.22 668.90 A: yeah 

667.85 672.99 B: wars seem to be losing propositions all the way back to worl- all the way back to the civil war 

673.51 674.31 B: (( ah )) 

673.63 675.12 A: yeah 

675.68 678.21 B: it's hard to get rich off war 

680.09 685.19 A: yeah and i think that's part of why bush is worried about the economy 

685.44 686.34 A: um 

686.55 695.37 A: you know going back to his firing of his economic advisors you know he knows this isn't going to be 

690.42 691.69 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

691.81 692.84 B: yeah 

695.73 698.10 A: this isn't necessarily going to help so 

697.75 705.04 B: yeah how long are we supposed to sustain this conversation [laughter] ten minutes my golly 

702.49 704.63 A: ten minutes [laughter] 

705.21 706.41 B: okay 

705.25 708.61 A: they they beep in and tell you when you're done so 

707.97 709.60 B: yeah i assumed [mn] 

709.86 710.91 B: (( ah )) 

711.19 712.25 A: but um 

713.74 716.91 A: it is it's been very interesting and just 

716.18 717.51 B: yeah 

716.94 719.74 A: to see how the media portrays it all 

719.23 719.89 B: right
