20.96 22.72 B: okay [laughter] 

21.40 27.86 A: they ask for my mom all the time [laughter] so we're talking about um our favorite holiday 

24.11 25.08 B: okay 

27.80 32.64 B: and uh if we could create a holiday what would we make and how would we celebrate it 

32.09 36.27 A: right okay so why don't you go tell me your favorite holiday first 

36.62 37.75 A: and why 

36.74 39.59 B: i think my favorite holiday is christmas 

39.90 41.14 B: and uh 

42.02 47.64 B: if i were to create a holiday i don't know i've never given it any thought what do you think 

45.73 49.79 A: mhm well why do you think why is christmas your favorite 

50.15 57.02 B: it just sort of changes people's attitude i know it's hectic and uh you go crazy w- with all you have to do 

56.65 57.81 A: yeah 

57.49 58.66 B: and uh 

58.89 65.32 B: um you know h- well my my children are actually grown but you know just i still kind of go crazy 

64.68 66.09 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

65.91 73.07 B: you know running around and still shopping and still give them gifts and you know bake and clean the house and go to work and 

72.43 73.65 A: right 

73.40 79.14 B: try to visit family and friends and so it it's very hectic but it's great because uh 

79.35 83.29 B: i don't know i guess we d- i mean our whole year is built around christmas isn't it 

82.68 85.91 A: yeah it has come to that for sure [laughter] 

85.42 87.06 B: yeah do you have children 

86.65 98.45 A: i don't no but christmas is also my favorite holiday and um for a bunch of different reasons i think because um you said it changes people's attitudes i think 

87.43 88.14 B: no 

98.67 108.27 A: people get in the spirit more they they they're kinder [laughter] you can really notice it i mean some people definitely get grouchy and fed up with it but 

100.57 101.40 B: yeah 

104.19 106.00 B: they are they absolutely 

108.38 118.38 A: um and another reason is because it uh brings uh most of the family together every year 'cause we're all over the place and i'm one of seven kids 

118.05 119.05 B: really 

118.46 125.32 A: yeah so it's nice to get together and i love shopping and buying gifts for people and giving it to them and seeing 

125.50 127.47 A: their reactions to it 

127.24 128.46 B: right 

127.59 131.89 A: so i really enjoy doing that so i think that's why it's my favorite [mn] 

131.31 132.75 B: where do you live now 

132.49 134.01 A: in boston 

133.83 137.97 B: in boston i'm in i'm right outside of philadelphia [mn] in the suburbs 

136.17 137.24 A: (( oh okay )) 

137.35 138.27 A: uh-huh 

138.60 148.94 A: [sigh] um okay so if we could create a holiday i'd like to create one that where there's a rule that there can be no commercialism [laughter] 

148.47 153.43 B: i'd like to create a holiday that would bring peace on earth 

153.29 154.54 A: yeah 

153.84 157.83 B: no wars and just you know put an end to violence 

157.54 161.15 A: so then it would be a year round holiday [laughter] 

159.41 165.27 B: [laughter] well that's kind of dreaming but even if you could just do it like maybe a month at a time 

164.57 166.06 A: yeah yeah 

165.28 167.30 B: and just have people uh 

167.50 173.04 B: acknowledge one another and their differences and even you know possibly 

173.58 174.55 B: uh 

174.71 182.04 B: you know give gifts and just like i said try to understand other people rather than be so willing to kill them for their differences 

181.36 182.73 A: right 

183.25 185.91 B: but that's that's a bit of a dream [laughter] 

185.64 188.20 A: that's okay i think we're allowed to dream 

187.57 189.88 B: we're absolutely allowed to dream 

188.77 193.03 A: [laughter] oh gosh i have to come up with something here um 

195.67 196.81 A: (( [sigh] hm )) 

197.98 206.51 A: i guess we sorta i was gonna say a holiday to um celebrate and care for the earth but i guess we have that we have earth day is that is that national 

206.12 210.98 B: i think it's national it's just it's just not i don't think it's celebrated that much 

210.66 215.04 A: all right well maybe we can we can pump that one up a little [laughter] 

211.13 212.64 B: and it should be 

214.68 221.41 B: yeah and i have a great idea for it i think you'd like get all the kids out of school and have them go out and like clean 

221.41 222.91 A: wouldn't that be great 

222.10 230.62 B: pick up trash along you know pl- areas that are s- you know relatively safe and and with someone watching over them so that you know 

226.56 227.55 A: right 

229.00 232.67 A: right and make them feel like they're making a difference you know 

231.45 237.01 B: yeah and help them like clean up and and maybe if they did that they'd they'd take more pride in uh 

237.18 238.68 B: in their world 

238.43 242.42 A: right yeah it's unbelievable to me how many people 

242.45 246.82 A: i see [sigh] throwing trash out of the car oh 

245.23 246.95 B: mhm 

246.92 248.12 A: it's horrible 

248.17 251.84 B: what about things like graffiti and and uh 

251.14 252.75 A: right 

252.15 256.42 B: just destruction i guess you see a lot more of that in the city 

255.86 257.71 A: right definitely 

256.76 259.14 B: because of the concentration of people 

259.22 260.29 A: right 

260.28 261.84 B: [mn] and uh 

262.97 265.66 B: i don't know i think we could all do so much better 

267.37 268.86 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

268.19 272.50 B: for the world and for each other and i sound like a philosopher i'm not really 

271.95 273.71 A: [laughter] 

272.98 279.46 B: [laughter] just uh he asked the question and i had about three seconds to think about it just like well what would be great 

277.10 278.50 A: i know what 

278.79 283.22 A: that's funny 'cause a lot of people i'm sure think the same things you're saying 

283.36 294.16 A: and y- you know you feel like you're philosophizing philosophi- you know what i'm trying to say [laughter] but i mean if we would all just take little steps you know little 

287.24 289.28 B: that's right [laughter] 

294.24 295.38 A: actions 

295.52 297.79 A: i mean we can make a huge difference 

298.09 299.44 A: (( so [sigh] )) 

300.27 301.63 A: anyhow 

300.93 303.35 B: yeah i think they're both good ideas 

303.72 306.45 B: implementing them would be another problem [laughter] 

305.38 308.71 A: right i don't think we need to solve that [laughter] 

308.01 310.37 B: yeah they didn't ask us for that right 

310.05 311.29 A: (( all right )) 

311.18 314.04 B: [lipsmack] so uh what do you do for christmas

437.18 438.61 A: yeah 

438.34 441.61 B: and i didn't even get into the religious part of it i um 

443.06 445.80 B: i guess you're christian if you celebrate christmas 

444.91 446.49 A: (( yeah yeah [sigh] ))

460.02 466.24 A: but you're right isn't that funny like we didn't even get into the religious aspect [laughter] 

465.02 465.95 B: right 

466.61 475.02 A: i don't know i don't know why i think it feels so off limits a lot of the time to talk about it with people [laughter] which is too bad but 

471.56 479.73 B: you're right you're right about that because if you er i mean i didn't know coming into this conversation if you were christian i didn't wanna start with religion 

479.27 480.26 A: right 

480.23 483.04 B: 'cause it you might find it offensive um 

482.07 483.55 A: exactly 

483.99 489.29 B: um i don't find it offensive any religion i don't find offensive but that doesn't speak for everyone 

488.82 491.49 A: that's unfortunately true yeah 

490.74 492.62 B: right but uh we 

492.65 497.98 B: we usually have the tree decorated a week or two usually a week before christmas so 

498.31 500.82 B: the house is looking real uh 

501.11 502.28 B: festive 

501.79 502.71 A: uh-huh 

503.38 506.34 B: and sometimes i even go out and chop down a tree 

506.08 507.66 A: oh that's great 

507.05 509.47 B: yeah but usually i just buy one 

509.56 512.60 B: and it's a real tree it's not uh artificial 

511.46 514.52 A: right yeah you have to get the real thing 

513.89 516.71 B: yeah you have to get that's right you have to get the real thing 

516.23 519.78 A: with a smell and it just makes a big difference 

519.54 523.39 B: i had a tree a few years ago that a skunk must have visited 

522.86 524.38 A: (( oh my gosh oh no )) 

523.62 535.35 B: [laughter] and i didn't know it until i brought it home and you know 'cause it was very cold out and i brought it home and had it all decorated [sigh] and then i started smelling it i was like where is that smell coming from 

528.80 529.78 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

534.57 536.23 A: oh my gosh 

535.37 538.27 B: [laughter] and here it it had to be the tree 

538.30 545.10 B: 'cause there were there were no skunks in the house i i just kept spraying it and it was like i could take it down and take it back but 

538.35 540.39 A: oh what did you do 

544.17 546.31 A: oh all that work [mn] 

545.43 550.41 B: all that work and i thought no let me just keep i kept spraying it with things to neutralize the odor 

550.03 552.07 A: that's so funny 

551.22 553.15 B: [laughter] 

552.13 553.78 A: oh my gosh 

553.83 563.03 B: so from here on in i'm sniffing the tree and people are people will be sure i'm insane but you know there's a there's a reason for it [laughter] 

555.94 557.94 A: [laughter] 

559.87 560.61 A: [laughter] 

562.41 568.08 A: gosh i never even thought about that i bet they didn't even know that skunks had gotten to it 

567.08 575.85 B: no you couldn't smell it outside it was very cold and as i said as the tree sort of it wasn't frozen but as it sort of settled down in the heat of the house it uh 

568.17 569.33 A: right 

573.77 574.71 A: yeah 

575.87 579.07 B: began to give off this odor it's like whoa 

578.95 580.29 A: that's funny 

580.63 585.58 A: [laughter] [sigh] well i'm trying to think of another holiday to create 

585.75 590.91 A: since we have the time i thought i thought this would be much shorter this is my first call 

590.66 592.44 B: okay it's my second 

591.87 593.59 A: ah okay 

593.86 596.95 A: um so and is the time the same every time 

596.38 601.25 B: yeah someone uh the computer will interrupt and tell you when ten minutes are up and uh 

600.30 602.29 A: oh it's ten minutes okay 

601.39 604.64 B: yeah so it it's really q- quite easy to do 

604.17 605.54 A: yeah 

604.93 610.97 B: my my son is a um a linguist at university of pennsylvania and he was just curious as to how far 

610.84 623.57 B: this has gone so far i spoke to the first person was in atlanta and he was happy to hear that you know because these calls start with a a number of people who contact friends and ask them to be part of the survey 

623.15 624.66 A: right right 

623.78 628.21 B: and just you know h- uh if it goes across the united states so much better 

628.21 629.67 A: right 

629.06 633.31 B: i don't know what the absolute uh reason for it wh- what they're 

633.48 637.33 B: what tokens they're taking from conversations 

636.93 639.27 A: i know it's in it's sort of 

639.29 640.28 A: (( i don't know )) 

640.34 642.97 A: (( nerve wracking [laughter] to think about it sometimes )) 

642.82 648.32 B: well i think it's better if you just don't think we don't know what they are so you just talk like you would uh 

647.36 649.72 A: yeah it's better not to know 

649.31 651.24 B: under any circumstances 

651.54 652.25 A: hm 

652.48 653.38 B: so 

654.16 654.75 A: (( [sigh] )) 

656.07 659.58 B: but we have to think of a name for this holiday [laughter] 

658.22 660.78 A: oh we need a name [noise] [noise] 

659.88 661.33 B: the peace 

662.53 663.88 A: let's see

687.75 691.29 A: (( [laughter] [noise] that's cute )) 

692.40 694.48 A: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

692.90 704.92 B: it was interesting my son was in italy last week and he was saying that uh he had been there a number of times before so he knows a number of people and they were saying that that they began talking about nine eleven 

705.33 706.90 B: and crying 

706.67 707.74 A: oh 

707.10 713.88 B: these italian people they were just so empathetic with with what went on here and so sad about it 

713.74 715.16 A: oh yeah 

713.94 719.95 B: i was a little surprised at that i know people all over the world were very concerned when it happened uh 

719.36 719.89 A: right
