164.08 165.70 A: (( mm so i )) 

164.91 174.41 B: yeah uh but you actually made a a good point there's no gift exchange there's no pressure to give stuff there's there's nothing ulterior about the whole gathering 

170.41 172.21 A: right 

173.22 184.91 A: right you you don't you don't feel like you have to go out someplace or see a parade or or anything like that it's just getting together with the family enjoying a meal together enjoying an afternoon together um so i i i really like that 

177.55 178.81 B: right 

184.13 187.39 B: that's cool and so how has that so how was your thanksgiving 

186.88 193.72 A: oh it was it was very nice it was at my um my aunt has done it every year for as long as i remember 

188.38 189.34 B: nice 

193.30 194.21 B: (( wow )) 

193.74 197.72 A: and uh she's getting pretty old now but but she was up to it again this year 

197.77 210.65 A: and uh and came out everybody now instead of she m- instead of her making all the food everybody brings a dish or something so she'll cook the turkey and you know a couple of the sides and everybody else brings the sides and so forth and the desserts 

206.34 208.57 B: everybody brings a side yeah 

209.39 210.46 B: (( right )) 

210.47 212.69 B: does anybody have like a specialty 

210.70 212.05 A: so yeah 

212.79 217.88 B: with their sides like is there something that you particularly like like there was som- one person that brings something 

213.73 214.91 A: um 

216.45 231.20 A: there was one person i think my cousin ann made a really nice uh sweet potato uh just this year uh it was it was absolutely delicious and my mother in law made um made rice with lamb this year which was very good too 

221.99 223.16 B: oh nice 

225.76 226.87 B: wow 

230.45 231.83 B: nice 

231.20 245.27 A: yeah and and i love the rolls [laughter] when my my grandmother was alive she would always make uh potato salad which was which was very very good 

232.23 233.27 B: so 

234.04 235.32 B: oh yeah 

235.41 239.88 B: that's true the rolls are good the biscuits [laughter] 

244.56 245.66 B: yeah 

245.07 251.87 A: but as she got older she lost her taste and it ended up being you know swimming in uh vinegar 

251.61 252.98 B: oh my god 

252.41 257.80 A: so the last few years of her life we wouldn't let her make it any more because she it would just be you you couldn't eat it 

257.17 266.77 B: could be uh uh inedible oh my god that's funny and so how did you gently tell her that there was something wrong with the dish 

259.12 260.51 A: yeah exactly 

260.98 262.24 A: exactly 

265.78 270.75 A: yeah oh it was it was it just came out we can't eat this you know [mn] 

269.52 275.13 B: we can't eat this [laughter] and she took it in stride she was cool with it 

273.57 284.28 A: well no she she thought there was nothing wrong with it because it tasted fine to her it was just that her that her taste got so then she let my aunt make it [laughter] it was 

277.28 278.23 B: right 

282.06 283.73 B: that's too funny 

283.53 289.02 B: yeah you know the funny thing is my my aunt mary started to lose her her taste buds and when she would make dishes they were like 

288.83 299.22 B: very bland you know it was like oh my god so but the thing is we were too embarrassed to tell her that you know that the dish wasn't that good so we had to just tough it out [laughter] but um 

289.80 291.61 A: mhm 

297.01 303.11 A: right right so what what ho- what holiday would you invent if you c- could invent one 

302.64 304.82 B: jeeze that's a good question you know i 

305.25 307.14 B: [sigh] did you think of one 

306.67 311.55 A: oh yeah absolutely opening day baseball opening day 

307.37 309.01 B: yeah what would you invent 

309.93 310.71 B: op- 

311.06 316.91 B: oh baseball opening day and so what would be required at baseball op- no work 

313.10 314.40 A: yeah there'd be 

315.06 320.23 A: no work no work everybody could would either go to a game or watch the game on tv 

320.56 326.50 A: [laughter] 'cause i i've only i i used to work at a at a company where um 

321.09 323.66 B: that's nice that's nice 

326.79 341.42 A: they d- didn't their vacation policy was basically you got twenty days a year and you could do w- whatever you wanted with them so that included holidays and vacation days and so forth um so i always said that that opening day was my holiday 

333.26 334.28 B: mhm 

340.93 342.10 B: [laughter] 

341.48 346.46 A: and so they knew i would be at at stanway park you know watching the red sox opening day 

346.87 355.34 A: and you know just marked on the calendar [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

346.98 348.06 B: (( that's a good one )) 

350.11 351.70 B: [laughter] your name 

351.71 353.37 B: there you go holiday 

353.42 363.83 B: that's pretty cool i think that would be a a a fairly well received holiday in massachusetts i've never seen a town so devoted to baseball as massachusetts like and boston 

358.60 359.55 A: yeah i 

362.43 373.67 A: oh yeah i i i would phillies because they're signing all these free agents and whatnot and building a new stadium i would think that the philies fans would be would be pretty excited 

363.87 365.35 B: unbelievable 

372.13 379.10 B: just as ecstatic yeah i you know the funny thing is i was always like i was never a big fan of baseball but um 

377.42 378.62 A: mhm 

379.28 388.57 B: i ha- uh but i did feel this sort of you know really strong devotion to baseball and but not as much as in boston i mean and i was i was born and raised in philly 

388.10 389.01 A: (( mhm )) 

388.38 392.79 B: and now being a transplant here in massachusetts for i don't know two two three years 

392.59 401.46 B: it just doesn't feel like this is like a significant event you know like this is part of your culture and so you're bred this whole thing so i mean at at work it's 

395.53 397.36 A: mhm 

398.94 400.14 A: right 

401.33 414.09 B: it's huge you know everybody talks about it and it they're right on the game they know what's going on with all the players and it's like incredible and even to the the cashiers at the front end they all know about this stuff i'm like damn i gotta get involved because 

401.57 403.91 A: mhm 

413.96 420.57 B: [laughter] this is you know i'm looking like a complete fool not knowing anything about the game but um 

420.47 431.42 B: so it's amazing i mean i i didn't experience that in philadelphia as much yeah but i don't think uh the phillies were ever a really really good team i just remember like in the early eighties they were doing something pretty good but 

424.34 425.65 A: mhm 

431.14 441.24 A: yeah they had spent for a while but no the the the phillies would be one of the lesser successful franchises in the history of major league baseball yeah 

434.77 435.73 B: the worst 

437.29 438.26 B: yeah 

438.70 450.62 B: absolutely i mean and as far as the like the whole pedigree on who was who's come out of the boston red sox because i can name a couple of players and i can't name any from ph- philly pete rose but he's like he's got some 

450.21 451.55 A: not mike schmidt 

450.98 456.33 B: and mike schmidt [laughter] they got some problems well pete rose has some problems [laughter] his name's sort of notorious 

455.82 456.96 A: oh yeah 

456.36 459.00 B: but other than that i mean 

459.12 466.41 B: it's always been like the yankees and the red sox [laughter] to a certain extent but yeah that's interest- 

465.15 467.90 A: so so have you thought of a holiday yet you'd like to have 

467.33 468.35 B: (( um )) 

468.77 471.70 B: i don't know i mean i actually 

472.61 483.90 B: haven't thought about it that much to tell you the truth don't really think about it's kind of an awkward question because i never really thought about an a a particular holiday that i would want you know um i guess it would be like a 

480.28 481.76 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

485.30 491.75 B: hm something where people had to give me gifts [laughter] besides it wouldn't 

487.82 491.97 A: [laughter] eric day 

491.81 493.78 B: eric day exactly 

492.43 496.07 A: (( [laughter] )) 

493.81 499.04 B: [laughter] so everybody has a day off and they all gotta come round my house and give me gifts [laughter] 

498.46 500.83 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

499.10 502.64 B: but um i guess something like what you said [mn] 

502.81 508.01 B: probably around an event and i i'm a big cyclist so i like i like the tour de france so i guess 

506.93 509.21 A: oh i i i bicycle too 

508.97 520.14 B: oh really oh cool so i think like if the tour de france like would open that would be like kind of like that would be the day you get to watch the first day but actually that that race doesn't really kick in for me until they hit the alps 

509.50 510.44 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

519.54 520.69 A: mhm 

520.04 525.40 B: so that's when i start getting excited about that race but um other than that how how long you been riding 

525.59 535.29 A: well [mn] i was i was riding when i was in college and that was twenty years ago and then i stopped for a long time and then about three or four years ago i picked it up again 

534.66 535.96 B: mhm 

535.33 544.45 A: and now that i've started working at u. mass um there's a bike trail that goes from northampton right up to the university campus 

544.47 551.72 A: so what i'll do is i'll drive up to there um and then bike in the last eight miles to work 

551.65 552.82 B: nice 

551.84 563.84 A: during the summer yeah and then and on weekends when i have time i'll you know i'll do a longer ride [noise] uh and then every fall i do a um the american lung association ride on cape cod 

553.14 554.02 B: that's a 

556.80 558.14 B: mhm 

563.27 565.63 B: oh how how and h- h- how long's that 

565.00 567.62 A: that's a hundred and sixty miles in three days 

567.19 569.38 B: wow that's a good ride 

568.80 573.06 A: yeah and i did a few years ago i i took a vacation and did um 

573.34 578.93 A: a uh back roads trip through wine country in california and that was two hundred miles in five days 

578.48 582.90 B: wow so you've logged some some serious miles on your on your legs 

581.02 582.44 A: yeah 

582.62 585.79 A: yeah yeah 

582.95 584.98 B: that's not bad 

584.85 599.53 B: the funny thing is i just i like you i took a hiatus from the saddle and uh before i was really competitive i was really getting involved and i was you know my performance was pretty good and the funny thing is your brain remembers exactly where you left off but your body is nowhere near that 

597.15 598.61 A: mhm 

598.90 600.25 A: exactly 

599.60 610.25 B: and i got in the saddle just like in the summertime and i was ripping up a hill and i'm thinking oh i'm gonna tear it up i'm gonna do it like ten times like i used to do and i went up it and i was dying 

609.69 611.50 A: [laughter] 

610.05 622.28 B: i went up it was like the first thing i did didn't even warm up did nothing just went on it cold and went from zero to flat out and i was like i think i almost like passed out it was like this is really stupid so 

614.91 616.67 A: right 

619.33 620.78 A: oh yeah 

621.56 623.24 A: (( [laughter] )) 

622.23 631.06 B: you know but the funny thing is i felt that i was much more resilient like ten ten years ago and i that's true i was i mean i i could do stupid crap like that you know 

627.73 628.94 A: oh sure 

629.85 631.62 A: right 

630.85 639.33 B: but now it's like my body's telling me you know what you really gotta be careful [laughter] and i got some back problems now it's like it's not even funny i'm like this is ridiculous 

634.56 635.55 A: yeah 

638.86 647.17 A: oh i had the same bike for twenty years i had an old univega and last last year i just couldn't get the hills with it um 

642.41 643.28 B: yeah 

647.36 652.50 A: and i saw everybody else had the granny gear and i didn't 

651.99 653.52 B: the triple yeah 

652.72 660.03 A: yeah so i went out and got myself a new a new bike with a with the granny gear and i've had no problems with any hills since then 

659.77 663.20 B: see the funny thing is i have not changed my gear ratio 

662.71 663.64 A: mhm 

662.99 674.81 B: and i was a a fairly strong climber and i i actually was trying to max out the size of my my ring so i was like a forty two inside ring with the with the largest ring in the back was a twenty one 

664.99 665.80 A: mhm 

669.14 670.92 A: mhm 

671.20 672.72 A: mhm 

674.29 675.28 A: mhm 

674.68 681.95 B: and that was getting me over any major obstacle in philadelphia 'cause we weren't known for our big our big hills all right just for the 

680.14 681.46 A: right 

681.95 689.36 B: legendary thing there's a tour de tour de pont or some sorta like that and one of the legs is the is that philadelphia they have like a 

685.81 686.84 A: mhm 

689.14 701.31 B: a core states race used to call it now it's called fleet or something like that one of the banks bought the whole thing any case that was a pretty tough climb but now it's like i'm thinking about you i'm thinking maybe i should actually get a triple because 

692.42 693.78 A: mhm 

701.07 712.36 B: even though my ego would be shot to shit [laughter] it's like you know putting a triple on it's just one of those things like i can't climb any more i mean even if i had like a i guess a what are they a a a thirty nine inside ring 

711.93 713.19 A: yeah 

712.32 716.91 B: you can probably go as low what's the lowest you can go with the granny on a on a road bike 

716.74 718.28 A: gee i don't know 

717.76 719.32 B: (( you know there must )) 

718.34 719.89 A: i don't know i just i just bought the
