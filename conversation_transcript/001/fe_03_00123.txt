49.93 50.80 B: all i know is that 

51.54 51.82 B: i 

51.92 52.64 B: don't (( really )) 

53.30 54.89 B: think approve of what they're doing 

56.98 58.87 A: i don't think anybody particularly 

59.33 59.88 A: can but 

61.18 61.78 A: i don't know 

63.74 65.65 A: i don't know how much it's our place to 

66.73 67.70 A: uh 

68.62 70.68 A: get in the middle of some of it though 

71.02 71.50 B: right 

80.49 82.73 A: eh you know we can't ignore it either because 

83.05 83.42 B: mhm 

83.34 83.64 A: (( )) 

84.89 87.66 A: too much of the world is ready to ignore it and uh 

88.23 89.72 A: we'd just be waiting for 

90.78 91.96 A: greater problems 

91.93 94.08 B: i i just don't understand how 

94.35 95.14 B: iraq got 

95.76 98.76 B: got involved in this all of a sudden i thought it was like 

98.93 100.22 B: mostly just be 

101.08 101.93 B: the whole 

103.37 108.77 B: like it like so- the terrorists from nine eleven were from saudi arabia or something 

108.90 113.07 B: and then the whole afghanistan thing and now it's iraq i just don't understand how they all relate 

110.63 111.32 A: right (( )) 

113.94 114.52 A: yeah (( )) 

115.37 116.42 A: it's not even 

116.75 117.99 A: well it's not entirely 

118.57 119.10 A: we're 

119.84 121.93 A: but in a formal way they do except that 

122.11 122.61 A: um 

123.61 124.00 A: i i 

124.15 128.40 A: seems like the best way they're figuring out how they relate is to follow the trail of money 

128.55 129.44 A: and that um 

130.01 130.66 A: and i'm hearing 

131.18 132.03 A: everything 

132.65 133.61 A: including that 

133.71 134.14 A: uh 

134.89 135.56 A: certain 

136.33 139.45 A: supposed charitable organizations in some 

140.16 142.34 A: um arab countries are actually 

142.96 144.42 A: send you know um 

144.61 152.78 A: diverting funds to al qaeda and that's pretty um amazing and frightening um 

149.52 150.67 B: that is a little sketchy 

152.79 153.29 B: yeah 

153.63 157.75 A: and you wonder if the people who are contributing to them realize that 

157.87 158.73 A: but um 

159.54 160.59 A: you know i don't know know 

162.06 163.55 A: in some instances 

164.68 167.48 A: how direct a connection some of of 

168.51 170.06 A: the various countries have 

170.16 170.91 A: um 

171.37 172.70 A: as opposed to simply 

172.80 176.47 A: you know getting into the notion of you know somebody is living in your country and 

176.93 179.45 A: are you willing to kick them out and if you're not then you're 

179.81 181.87 A: with him so you're our enemy 

181.69 182.06 B: mhm 

182.17 183.30 A: and eh you know it 

183.75 187.09 A: seems to be we're dividing up the world into us and them 

188.32 189.63 B: it really does i mean 

190.12 193.00 B: like actually i just talked about this a lot with my boyfriend last night 

193.81 194.34 B: and 

194.72 201.87 B: he's canadian so he has a completely different view of everything that's going on in the world than than say you or i would 

197.81 198.27 A: uh-huh 

202.17 205.03 B: but ha- l- he was telling me like 

205.88 207.76 B: a lot of a lot of people think that 

207.92 212.58 B: americans are like the stupidest people in the world basically because our government is kind of 

213.07 216.25 B: like right now we're very pro-war pro- 

216.47 217.89 B: pro-death pro 

218.26 219.30 B: everything and 

219.57 219.94 B: like 

220.98 228.31 B: and like we make mistakes and we don't apologize or like he was talking about how there was that one accidental bombing of six canadians (( )) 

228.46 228.84 A: hm 

228.50 232.44 B: that six canadians got killed and like they never even got an ap- apology apparently 

232.99 233.36 A: hm 

233.39 238.62 B: and they they just kind of skimmed over it i mean i remember hearing about this in the news and going that's strange 

239.00 242.13 B: but i didn't i thought that they would probably apologize but apparently they didn't 

241.44 242.08 A: yeah 

243.57 243.92 B: yeah 

245.30 245.71 B: mhm 

251.93 252.65 A: certainly 

256.88 257.60 A: could have 

257.89 259.78 A: that that kind of view where 

260.81 261.96 A: um now if you 

267.11 267.56 B: (( )) 

274.05 274.49 B: mhm 

275.46 279.53 A: which i think is frightening as well 

277.89 278.34 B: yeah 

279.65 281.75 A: that anybody thinks that 

282.94 286.76 A: um that anybody considers that that's a solution to anything 

285.82 286.20 B: mhm 

289.86 290.81 B: it's really scary 

290.35 291.89 A: but i know yeah i don't know 

293.47 293.81 A: and 

294.33 297.21 A: uh what but with the whole concept of the 

297.83 299.97 A: weapons inspections and all that it's like 

301.00 303.90 A: it seems to me the experiences before 

304.69 305.53 A: suggest that 

306.58 309.55 A: i i don't know how you can really find 

310.32 312.47 A: what you're looking for if 

312.79 314.57 A: if it's if it's there 

314.26 314.69 B: right 

314.86 317.72 A: if it's there how are you going to find it if 

318.34 318.80 A: you're 

319.03 321.30 A: you're sort of always going to be one step behind 

321.26 321.61 B: mhm 

321.66 324.53 A: them you know 

323.02 323.60 B: yeah my 

334.60 336.11 A: mhm 

336.14 337.44 B: like they wouldn't really 

337.94 338.71 B: think of 

338.86 340.27 B: and think of doing or 

340.94 341.63 B: think of 

342.75 343.18 B: like 

343.60 346.39 B: looking at like you know people's houses or whatever 

346.97 350.49 A: yeah i mean i think that's uh really possible um 

350.70 350.98 A: that 

354.36 354.78 A: uh 

354.68 355.07 B: mhm 

357.59 360.32 A: you know uh and even to the extent that 

361.29 364.05 A: that that might not be i think that there's 

364.42 365.82 A: i you know i don't know how much 

366.77 367.24 A: uh 

367.53 369.91 A: mobility there is in in 

370.02 371.25 A: all this but i can i can 

371.52 372.20 A: imagine 

373.47 373.77 A: like 

374.20 384.08 A: a floating sort of uh okay today they're coming this direction so um move south kind of thing 

382.68 383.17 B: yeah 

386.45 387.26 A: uh 

387.59 388.12 A: and 

390.23 391.25 A: you know i and 

391.88 394.04 A: then there was the news report um 

395.21 396.42 A: was it last week 

397.01 397.99 A: or maybe just the other 

398.21 399.86 A: the other day that they were saying 

400.11 400.45 A: uh 

401.14 401.56 A: um 

402.88 403.50 A: saying well 

403.90 407.93 A: you know why don't why doesn't the u._s. just stop playing games if we have proof to show them 

408.13 409.27 A: you know do- show the world 

409.51 410.36 A: what proof have we got 

410.48 410.90 B: right 

411.28 411.78 A: and 

412.27 420.35 A: that doesn't seem an unreasonable statement you know not to me (( i'm like i just )) i mean uh i don't know 

414.31 415.10 B: right 

420.39 432.30 B: i just think that what's scary is like what will bush think of oh well not just bush but like the whole bush administration what will they think of next to like blame iraq for i mean like obviously he wants to start a war you know he's his ratings were super 

435.41 436.23 B: because he handled that 

436.39 438.21 B: very appropriate and very well 

438.31 438.60 B: but 

438.83 449.40 B: like all of a sudden he's like trying to start this war and try trying to start that war and i just feel like he's trying to boost his ratings just because you know wars do that like for winning something you know go nationalism go the president 

449.10 449.48 A: mhm 

449.59 452.07 B: and it it just seems kind of ridiculous 

452.95 456.79 A: yeah i mean i think that that you know war time presidents have certainly uh 

457.06 457.50 A: had great 

457.63 458.56 A: popularity 

458.85 459.16 A: but 

459.49 460.82 A: generally speaking 

461.56 463.54 A: this country has been more inclined to 

463.93 464.65 A: need to be 

465.15 472.48 A: dragged into a war at least you know great wars (( )) now we're we're kind of 

468.85 471.06 B: yeah like the l- i know like 

472.60 475.54 A: saying where can where can we start one 

474.71 480.53 B: yeah and i i know in like world war one and world war two it was all we were like the last people to join up and 

480.86 481.24 B: and 

481.39 487.62 B: you know once we can once we did i don't want to sound very uh well i'm trying to make sense i don't sound what's the word i'm looking for um 

488.55 489.64 B: what conceited 

488.58 495.14 A: chauvinistic we we once we got there we we took care of it 

489.80 491.80 B: yes we did i don't want to sound conceited 

492.60 493.62 B: exactly 

493.86 494.29 B: but 

494.71 496.32 B: and i don't like 

496.55 499.34 B: like with world war one like everything was 

499.56 501.30 B: you know hunky dory and 

501.60 505.60 B: you know what the we didn't really bother with them and then all of a sudden we decided to bother with them and 

506.06 506.62 B: you know 

507.07 507.50 B: then 

508.77 509.64 B: just worked out that 

510.41 511.46 B: you know we won 

511.34 511.93 A: yeah 

519.94 522.49 B: until somebody got us involved like somebody pushed us to be involved 

521.35 522.22 A: mhm 

522.85 524.30 B: and that was japan with the bombing of 

524.04 524.85 A: right 

524.42 525.52 B: pearl harbor and 

526.41 530.90 B: i just think that like with the (( )) with stuff like the vietnam war we had no reason to be there 

531.78 532.29 B: i mean 

532.55 534.77 A: uh i mean we had we had more reason 

534.93 535.45 A: to 

535.60 536.48 A: consider 

536.78 542.04 A: in what was known of what was going on in europe in world war two to have gotten involved and yet 

542.51 543.55 A: we didn't 

543.68 547.53 A: uh-huh and it was just a real change in what 

543.72 544.15 B: yeah 

544.26 545.04 B: in eh 

548.10 549.33 A: the u._s. is about 

549.37 549.89 B: right 

549.46 549.90 A: um 

552.27 552.87 A: bush is about 

553.04 553.55 B: yeah 

554.62 557.06 B: i just i just see a lot of similarities between 

557.31 559.56 B: uh uh right as this moment between bush and nixon 

560.30 564.16 B: because i see like he's just trying to get us into wars that we don't need to be in 

560.31 561.38 A: mhm 

564.84 565.23 B: like
