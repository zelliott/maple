58.61 61.67 A: and he's not going to not get reelected in the middle of a war 

62.81 64.70 A: so i feel like he's just trying to find excuses 

65.00 69.19 B: uh-huh he's not he's not going to not get reelected (( )) 

68.94 71.96 A: right if if he starts a war i don't see i mean but i don't think that 

72.07 72.62 A: pe- the 

73.02 73.78 A: citizens 

73.92 75.46 A: of the u._s. would go against him 

75.74 76.39 B: uh-huh 

76.44 78.05 A: because that's not very patriotic 

79.03 80.20 B: oh 

81.50 82.83 B: well 

84.85 94.87 B: that's pretty interesting i don't know i think with the the last election showed i don't know i i think it showed that people are a lot more conservative across the country 

95.33 96.92 B: than a lot of people thought 

97.67 99.45 A: yeah um 

100.75 101.50 A: i mean 

103.37 106.47 A: i i actually think the the last election was also just a part of it 

106.75 110.06 A: i mean last election didn't didn't surprise me that republicans gained a lot 

110.06 110.84 B: oh really 

111.11 111.52 A: um 

112.40 113.17 A: no i didn't i had 

112.43 112.88 B: huh 

113.27 114.37 A: think it was really surprising 

114.57 115.29 B: yeah 

115.38 116.13 A: um but i 

116.27 118.11 A: i would be surprised if the next election 

118.33 118.94 B: uh-huh 

118.72 120.85 A: showed the same especially with the economy the way it is 

121.10 121.78 B: yeah 

122.02 123.95 A: um and everything unless we're in a war because 

124.77 128.00 A: like i said i really believe that people want to be patriotic to the country 

128.10 128.79 B: uh-huh 

129.89 135.75 B: yeah well you know if things are going well people tend not to change the administration 

134.30 134.69 A: right 

135.57 140.22 A: right and li- i mean the only the only way i would think that it might change (( )) 

136.09 136.66 B: yeah 

140.38 141.83 A: the economy stays the way it is 

142.35 143.23 A: then people might 

142.41 142.83 B: mhm 

143.51 146.53 A: you know feel like it's time for a change and that if regardless 

146.74 147.51 B: yeah 

147.47 149.10 A: of anything just because they you know 

149.27 150.78 A: financially people are really suffering 

150.78 151.46 B: uh-huh 

151.85 152.39 B: uh-huh 

152.76 158.12 B: so what do you think they should do about the inspections do you think we should disarm them or or 

157.36 160.27 A: i mean if there are arms you know i mean they 

160.86 164.94 A: been if that if they find them then i think you know by all means disarm then 

165.37 166.87 A: is it worth a war i don't think so 

167.70 168.31 B: (( )) 

168.12 171.49 A: not at this point i mean i really like i heard on the radio today on n._p._r. 

172.17 175.68 A: this uh quote i can't remember which president it was i think actually it was a j._f._k. 

175.83 176.45 B: uh-huh 

176.53 179.76 A: and he said that the u._s. would never fir- first 

180.55 181.40 B: oh 

181.41 183.03 A: and i kind of agree with that 

183.09 183.79 B: uh-huh 

183.54 187.67 A: i don't think that's i don't think it's something that's so pressing that we should strike first 

188.32 190.12 A: you know not to say that we should always be the victim 

191.00 191.42 A: but 

191.56 194.72 A: i mean you you can always you know can preempt an attack 

195.41 197.88 A: like if you know something's coming but just to start it out of the blue 

198.57 202.59 A: before anything's planned or anything's really foreseen that's going to happen i'm not so sure i agree with 

202.37 205.82 B: uh-huh so how would they disarm 

206.36 207.14 B: without 

207.65 208.93 B: i mean what if uh 

208.45 210.31 A: i think they have to do it according to the u._n. 

210.45 210.99 B: uh-huh 

211.60 213.50 A: i don't think i don't think we should go against the u._n. 

213.90 215.47 B: oh yeah yeah 

215.00 215.42 A: you know 

215.84 217.79 A: and i mean if the u._n. as a whole decides 

218.08 220.43 A: you know to to go to war then i guess it's a good decision 

220.43 221.31 B: mhm 

221.44 221.86 A: um 

222.36 225.06 A: and i know not everybody in the u._n. is friendly with the u._s. 

225.66 227.44 A: so they might just want to vote against the u._s. 

227.55 228.19 B: right 

228.41 230.03 A: i think we have to respect the u._n. 

230.35 232.25 A: i mean we became part of it because we believed in it 

232.47 233.01 B: yeah 

234.21 235.94 A: and that's how our country works you know by 

236.47 237.72 A: having this kind of system 

238.18 238.76 B: mhm 

238.74 242.06 A: you know just like the court system not everybody believes in it but we still follow it and 

241.89 242.75 B: right 

243.99 244.30 A: so 

245.22 247.18 B: well that's true you have to have some kind of rules 

247.84 250.42 A: yeah i mean otherwise you never know what'll happen i mean 

251.04 254.02 A: couldn't we could elect someone who ends up going crazy and who knows (( )) 

254.66 260.59 B: well that's why why we got those balance of powers hopefully 

260.15 260.79 A: (( )) 

260.72 263.23 B: hopefully everything falls into place and that doesn't work 

260.97 261.52 A: hopefully 

263.30 264.07 A: right 

263.65 265.43 B: (( )) you know and doesn't doesn't happen 

267.51 268.15 B: hmm 

267.70 268.03 A: yeah 

268.90 270.11 A: i mean i don't know like 

270.33 270.93 A: if if 

271.06 274.67 A: people in i mean i'm also in manhattan and manhattan is very west wing 

274.89 275.44 B: mhm 

276.11 277.04 A: you know so i hear 

277.66 278.68 A: like people here are not 

279.13 280.05 A: so pro-bush 

280.15 280.72 B: uh-huh 

280.23 281.09 A: i mean some people are 

281.23 281.76 A: but um 

285.74 287.16 B: they they are or they aren't 

287.02 288.74 A: yeah a lot of wall street people are republi- 

288.92 289.90 B: right right 

291.26 292.82 A: but i would say the majority of people here 

293.00 294.90 A: i mean i think that's alwa- like manhattan usually votes 

295.32 295.85 A: democrat 

295.93 296.51 B: uh-huh 

297.07 297.43 A: um 

298.55 299.81 A: i don't know what it's like in arizona 

300.06 302.15 B: yeah well i grew up in connecticut 

302.26 304.05 A: oh you did so that's pretty liberal 

302.71 303.67 B: and uh 

303.81 304.72 B: yeah kind uh 

305.23 308.81 B: kind of makes me wonder what's going on there my mom still lives there but um 

309.17 314.95 B: yeah actually the the town i live in i live in flagstaff up in the mountains and it's a very 

313.33 313.98 A: oh yeah 

315.35 320.95 B: um it's a very um liberal town it's it's a 

327.62 327.94 A: uh-huh 

330.42 334.65 B: you know you've got a lot of retired people um but that's down in the south 

334.91 335.23 A: right 

335.09 337.30 B: in in the valley near phoenix um 

338.13 342.56 B: and uh so flagstaff is is pretty darn different 

341.60 341.88 A: right 

342.22 342.51 A: sure 

342.66 348.13 B: and uh yeah i'm probably in the minority in fact um my husband's retired military 

348.30 348.72 A: oh yeah

355.32 356.39 B: and uh

370.36 372.90 B: and uh so so that's kind of hard 

373.68 382.06 B: cause he's he's been through a lot he's traveled all over the world you know and and he's worked with a lot of foreign governments and uh it's 

382.18 383.93 B: it's just kind of hard to be 

384.34 386.57 B: to be us here right now 

384.52 385.06 A: i'm sure
