135.36 139.55 B: yeah they didn't give us much time to think about that one [laughter] 

137.50 142.21 A: no i've i've never thought of creating a holiday but it does seem like 

142.38 146.47 A: in the fall there there's an abundance like from 

146.99 151.73 A: like september to december it seems like there's almost always a party going on or 

151.94 153.06 A: and i'm okay with 

153.00 156.62 B: [laughter] you're pro p- you're pro party [laughter] 

153.81 154.79 A: (( that )) 

156.50 164.38 A: yeah but you know the winter i guess the beginning part of the year doesn't although i guess we do have long weekends like for uh 

164.48 172.37 A: human rights day and stuff like that but it seems like right there in february or march there could be something 

171.99 175.49 B: mhm right i think there's presidents day but it's not a day off 

174.36 176.10 A: yeah that's true 

176.11 182.82 B: but i'm learning to look forward to thanksgiving and christmas more usually i close the office down between 

182.92 189.41 B: um for that friday after thanksgiving so that's a nice break four days is uh a nice 

185.50 186.38 A: uh-huh 

189.43 192.49 B: nice time nice length of time to recharge your battery 

192.14 193.65 A: yeah definitely 

193.83 197.82 A: and do you travel on your vacations or just like stay home catch up on sleep 

197.53 198.77 B: uh 

197.85 200.23 A: all those other things that need to be paid attention 

199.29 200.48 B: usually i 

201.35 206.82 B: uh stay around and organize and catch up on things uh not necessarily so much sleep 

204.56 205.64 A: (( to right )) 

206.98 209.77 B: but there's always something to do uh 

209.07 209.98 A: right 

210.14 212.53 B: so there's always something on my list 

212.87 215.40 B: and i just started a practice three years ago 

215.50 216.60 A: oh 

215.75 219.93 B: so it's still relatively new uh very busy 

219.94 227.19 B: so in fact at uh like this vacation i'm gonna touch up on the paint on the walls [laughter] you know little things like that 

225.04 226.39 A: oh wow 

227.31 228.37 A: yeah 

227.76 230.94 B: tighten screws on the dental chairs that are a little loose 

231.14 231.87 B: (( you know )) 

232.12 240.05 A: so when you well i guess this isn't necessarily about holidays but when you started your practice did you have to come up with everything to get going or 

240.15 244.17 A: like did you have a a partner that went in on it with you or 

243.02 244.37 B: no it was just me 

244.79 246.09 A: wow 

245.49 246.78 B: just me 

246.23 250.14 A: so you had to have like start up and buy everything and 

248.17 250.70 B: oh yeah mhm 

250.35 251.96 A: [sigh] wow 

250.89 255.02 B: yeah but banks are always anxious to loan money at the 

254.05 255.16 A: that's true 

255.10 257.52 B: at the right rate 

255.24 258.24 A: especially especially i'm sure to 

258.43 262.75 A: i mean being a dentist doesn't sound like too risky of a business venture 

262.29 267.64 B: well actually it's very expensive that's one of the most expensive ventures that you can go into 

266.55 267.51 A: really 

267.70 275.17 B: because of all the equipment for example for a physician what do they st- need a stethoscope and an examining table 

268.85 270.03 A: that's true 

275.25 276.55 B: not much equipment 

276.05 278.64 A: true that's true but you guys have to be ready 

278.79 283.58 A: to scrape plaque and fill cavities and whiten teeth and anything else 

283.68 285.17 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

285.30 286.11 A: huh 

287.49 290.85 A: are are we just supposed to keep talking until they interrupt us or 

289.64 294.12 B: so but yeah it's ten minutes and they'll give us like a thirty second warning to say goodbye 

291.36 292.21 A: okay 

293.92 297.27 A: so is this just more than this is not your first call i'm guessing 

296.70 299.98 B: this is my second call i had one last night so i have one more 

297.83 298.73 A: (( second call )) 

300.70 302.51 B: so how did you get involved in the study 

302.41 308.04 A: cool um my husband's in linguistics at um u._s._c. and he got an email 

308.35 309.65 A: about it 

309.24 310.26 B: (( oh okay )) 

309.75 313.16 A: and he um kind of follows the 

313.75 315.57 A: i mean he had heard of uh 

316.03 320.04 A: the is it fisher i can't remember he had heard of the group that was doing the research 

319.34 320.33 B: right 

320.35 321.14 A: and that 

320.40 324.57 B: yeah this is i a friend of mine is uh doing this research 

324.15 325.47 A: oh cool 

324.86 328.25 B: (( so uh that's how i got involved )) 

328.40 332.09 B: and so every every person at that place needs thirty people 

328.69 330.32 A: oh right you can 

332.13 333.54 A: oh wow 

332.93 333.98 B: so 

334.59 341.38 B: i spoke to someone yesterday i can't remember where she was from um the suburbs of philadelphia so that's why 

341.54 346.49 B: i i'm surprised that from california but you know it's amazing this study ten years ago 

346.81 348.52 B: wouldn't have such 

348.61 350.74 B: diversity in terms of location 

350.39 352.48 A: oh no not at all i think 

351.42 352.93 B: you know isn't that amazing 

352.60 354.22 A: the internet has done 

354.82 358.31 A: amazing things for getting just spreading the word of stuff 

357.63 358.58 B: right 

360.94 361.93 B: (( it has )) 

361.74 362.70 A: (( hm )) 

362.66 364.50 B: (( so but but uh )) 

364.63 366.53 B: as far as holidays uh 

365.80 367.77 A: (( i know it's like holidays )) 

366.81 369.55 B: (( uh i guess we can stick to that topic um )) 

371.45 372.60 A: (( we have )) 

371.46 376.61 B: er so i think there's too many holidays that are that lose their meaning 

376.61 378.73 A: oh i agree with you entirely 

378.81 380.93 A: like it's all turned into 

381.30 387.44 A: another excuse to shop or to advertise or yeah hallmark or mhm 

382.82 386.27 B: right and cards and mhm yeah 

386.71 394.04 B: right and everyone has the same complaint you know in fact you know especially veterans day and memorial day i tend to 

394.19 398.27 B: wanna always stop and and pause and think and reflect 

398.45 399.40 B: uh 

400.26 405.56 B: you know even though it is a well memorial day at least is a day off but uh 

406.53 407.91 B: it is 

407.92 410.48 B: you know definitely a more somber serious 

411.17 412.12 B: holiday 

412.01 413.02 A: yeah 

413.29 418.74 A: i wonder if they're gonna do something with um september eleventh i mean it hasn't 

419.44 424.86 A: i mean holiday kind of to me implies you know m- more festive more 

425.09 431.10 A: fun times but i know that they do have [noise] more the more commemorative holidays like memorial day and [noise] 

430.94 435.32 B: yeah well i mean on the calendar they always have pearl harbor day 

434.94 436.20 A: yeah 

435.79 439.00 B: so i guess this would fall under that same 

436.81 437.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

439.76 440.88 B: category 

440.77 441.96 A: yeah 

442.73 444.30 B: (( so who knows what will )) 

444.31 446.36 B: be with uh future calendars 

446.37 449.66 B: i think it would have to be something from the president to say 

449.75 452.26 B: this is now a h- i wouldn't want a day off 

452.09 453.02 A: right 

452.81 455.17 B: i wouldn't wanna see that marred by 

455.28 462.89 B: you know people shopping and [mn] plus you sorta just get back to work and school [laughter] 

456.84 457.73 A: right 

463.13 463.97 B: (( you know )) 

463.26 464.43 A: yeah 

464.08 465.75 B: you don't really need that day off 

465.74 466.74 A: yeah 

466.75 470.69 A: yeah and it and it's right after uh is it right it's right after labor day

477.36 480.90 A: we have a holiday that we celebrate just at my house 

480.97 484.08 A: it's not a real holiday but it's like 

484.69 490.79 A: the day that my car broke that prevented me from moving and my husband and i ended up 

491.57 493.20 A: uh getting together

520.00 522.03 A: a horrible car or anything it was 

522.55 525.88 A: just so i ended up staying a couple of days longer and 

526.07 528.24 A: we spent those couple of days together and 

527.36 529.85 B: mhm oh wow and that cemented the relationship
