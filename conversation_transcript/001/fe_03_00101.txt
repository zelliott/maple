44.96 54.93 A: yeah that one is more of a game show more than reality but they kind of involve people's stories like you know torri is a fitness instructor and blah blah blah 

47.51 47.97 B: (( )) 

55.06 56.84 A: but it is more of a game show 

55.10 55.59 B: (( )) 

57.25 58.80 A: the other one fear factor 

58.89 60.15 B: o._k. 

59.58 62.25 A: but i am not i think that is more of a game show than like 

62.46 65.87 A: reality t._v. oh and the osbournes when i had cable 

66.39 66.92 B: o._k. 

67.09 68.67 B: i really 

68.93 76.84 B: i say i hate reality t._v. but then again i do watch the osbournes every once in a while and like i had to see who the bachelor picked and you know 

78.19 79.13 B: things like that 

79.25 83.08 A: oh and of course the reality t._v. show of all of them the real world 

83.73 86.48 B: oh yeah i haven't watched that one in forever but 

86.71 89.06 B: i used to like that show 

88.36 91.26 A: yeah i watched like the first season and then like 

91.38 94.40 A: the most recent season like chicago 

94.53 95.25 A: um 

96.07 101.12 A: only because i had not had cable in so long so i think it's more of a reason 

102.54 103.38 A: but i 

103.58 104.07 A: think 

104.17 113.93 A: i think if people well i don't know i didn't realize that like survivor and all these other things were as scripted as they were but they are 

114.13 115.15 B: oh o._k. 

114.24 114.79 A: which 

115.08 117.73 A: yeah i mean that was like the big thing it's 

124.63 125.31 B: yeah 

143.37 149.10 A: not watch them as watch but still there is a lot of emotion that comes through but how much of that is people 

149.53 151.43 A: overacting 

151.23 155.33 B: yes and worrying about what other people are thinking when while watching the show 

154.89 162.27 A: yeah like oh yeah i want to be the a bitch on the show 

157.91 158.37 B: o._k. 

161.88 165.01 B: so what is your opinion of like the newer 

165.50 167.36 B: shows like the bachelor 

166.92 168.20 A: the bachelor i 

168.42 169.05 A: can't 

169.73 179.52 A: i can't buy into the concept um probably after uh that whole 

180.06 180.73 A: um 

181.05 183.38 A: who wants to marry a millionaire thing 

183.40 184.43 B: yes

200.10 202.53 A: probably have to sort of buy into it like i think 

203.23 203.83 A: probably the 

204.75 208.02 A: better shows i mean it would have to be um 

209.56 210.30 A: um 

210.86 216.06 A: i i just don't think it is a very good thing i don't buy into it i don't like it i don't i don't even watch like 

216.78 220.89 A: i try to watch them and it just really doesn't really hold my attention 

221.23 221.70 A: um 

221.28 221.75 B: yeah 

221.91 226.96 A: other than like the really hot hyped like the first time they had ever been done like the osbournes and 

226.47 226.95 B: yeah 

227.34 228.22 A: (( )) 

227.44 234.81 B: i just wanted to see who the bachelor picked like (( )) because you know it has been a big deal on all the today shows oh what about that that 

234.96 237.88 B: where they were picking the the star whoever was going to 

238.05 245.28 B: i don't even know what it was called but they were trying to find like (( )) yeah that had a lot of hype 

241.22 242.59 A: oh american idol

265.72 268.25 B: yeah 

271.91 280.19 A: i don't know what do you i mean what do you think i mean i (( )) you know you watched the bachelor like did you care did you care about the girls or 

277.74 278.25 B: i don't 

279.48 288.54 B: no i didn't care about the like i didn't really like any of the shows at all i always just watched like the last episode just to see you know who wins or who picks what like i hate 

288.65 290.93 B: that amazing race thing it is the most 

290.06 291.08 A: yeah 

291.11 295.33 B: annoying show ever but i am sure like the last episode i'll watch just to see who wins it

299.76 301.70 A: am are whatever

309.97 310.98 B: (( )) 

314.59 319.62 A: in reality and survivor once it played itself out the first season i 

319.91 322.83 A: didn't really have that much time to get involved 

322.74 329.87 B: yeah and do you watch them when they are like the celebrity (( )) fear factor or like when they have the celebrities on there is that more important than 

329.67 332.42 A: i don't necessarily go out of my way to tune in 

332.29 333.61 B: hm 

333.28 334.07 A: so it is more of 

345.02 345.55 B: mhm 

346.96 353.91 A: um 

347.48 348.94 B: that is understandable 

355.78 356.43 A: um 

358.11 361.56 A: i guess fear factor no no not fear factor um 

362.05 365.79 A: oh my gosh why do i keep blanking out on that 

365.91 373.65 A: uh real real world real world and the osbournes the osbournes i definitely tuned in like all the time 

367.26 368.05 B: the osbournes 

368.93 369.21 B: (( )) 

373.80 377.45 A: like uh whatever every tuesday night when it was on but 

377.96 380.26 A: you know other than that 

379.74 383.89 B: you know that other show that they had that wasn't real world but it was like where they traveled everywhere 

384.13 385.42 A: oh road rules 

385.66 386.75 B: did you watch that one 

386.95 391.57 A: no not at all because it like it was uh 

392.24 394.05 A: it was so 

394.20 396.23 A: obviously trying to 

396.64 398.41 A: capitalize on 

399.37 402.42 A: all the people from real world 

402.20 402.78 B: uh-huh 

402.97 407.12 A: i was just like oh my gosh i didn't you know it was interesting to watch these people but

423.25 424.62 B: other people or 

425.04 426.12 A: probably 

426.41 427.18 A: oh 

426.45 428.22 B: whatever makes (( )) t._v. i guess 

428.08 435.94 A: oh did you ever i watched a few i do have to um oh my gosh this is terrible i watched a few episodes of 

437.21 437.98 A: big brother 

438.36 438.88 B: mhm 

439.37 440.71 A: i guess it was house one 

441.02 442.12 B: yeah i watched the last 

442.37 447.67 B: the last ones on both episodes like both seasons of that i watched just to see who won 

450.53 457.28 A: was definitely i mean there was a lot it it seemed like there was a lot more real controversy on that one because 

457.84 458.31 B: yeah 

458.01 459.61 A: like it was a closed 

460.42 461.33 A: set like 

461.46 463.61 A: you know it was purposely done on like 

463.77 467.52 A: you know a movie lot and um 

465.54 465.99 B: yeah 

467.93 469.63 A: you know there were people who 

469.89 477.12 A: really left because they were really troubled by this whole situation and that was a lot more of a it just seemed 

476.63 479.20 B: reality 

481.78 483.26 A: boring because you are like 

483.43 484.89 A: ew you know that's 

485.01 488.25 A: that's you know they were i mean they were almost cracking people 

488.53 489.25 A: because they were 

489.95 494.56 A: under such scrutiny where as like because the cameras 

491.63 492.07 B: mhm 

494.68 502.14 A: weren't necessarily uh it seemed like they had probably like a smaller camera crew so the people there didn't really have like 

499.50 499.98 B: mhm 

512.76 517.48 A: they were i'm sure a lot more people running around them that there were on big brother big brother 

512.85 513.23 B: yeah 

517.76 518.31 B: yeah 

518.51 520.41 B: would you ever do a reality t._v. show 

518.62 518.97 A: (( oh )) 

520.40 525.55 A: would i ever do one i don't think 

525.70 527.64 A: i have 

528.29 529.48 A: the time 

529.64 533.61 A: like i don't know i mean it's just i don't know what these people really get 

533.76 536.31 A: out of doing it because i i 

546.55 550.41 A: i would probably get so self conscious because there is a camera there it would be like 

551.42 552.10 A: get out of my 

552.26 555.37 A: um get the camera out of my face you know and i would probably (( miss it )) 

563.34 563.71 A: uh-huh
