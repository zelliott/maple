0.43 1.72 B: hi 

2.14 4.22 B: um my name is celeste 

5.55 6.50 B: can you hear me 

6.31 8.47 A: yes i can hear you [noise] 

9.62 11.55 B: okay um 

9.74 10.48 A: oh 

12.26 14.48 B: so i guess we're suppose to talk about holidays 

14.65 16.58 A: mhm 

15.30 18.72 B: um do you want to start or would you prefer that i do that 

19.14 21.46 A: uh you go ahead and start [laughter] 

22.15 27.59 B: wow okay well i'm not really sure that i have a favorite holiday um 

27.67 31.39 B: [lipsmack] i tend to think of holidays as uh 

31.81 40.21 B: somewhat marketing driven in today's somewhat jaded world but at the same time i would also say that um they're 

40.33 43.35 B: nice opportunities to be able to uh 

43.39 49.97 B: see people you know i.e. family and friends that you may not have seen for awhile and that's great i i mean i think they're talking about holidays as in 

50.04 52.86 B: you know like christmas valentines day etc 

51.62 53.32 A: mhm 

53.01 54.38 B: so um 

54.92 68.96 B: it's kind of where i'm at on the other hand um i lived in japan several years ago and what was kind of interesting is they had all different holidays there that was sort of great to have one that was like children's day and sports day and culture day 

67.75 69.10 A: (( [noise] oh really )) 

69.05 69.99 B: sorry 

69.91 71.72 A: (( i i that's that's )) 

71.85 76.12 A: i i didn't i didn't i never heard of that th- that's that's new to me you know 

75.10 77.50 B: yeah it's not it was kind of great because 

77.89 85.78 B: um you know they have this reputation for working incredibly hard which is actually true but there are more holidays there than than gosh anywhere else i've ever heard of 

85.98 96.65 B: so um and they were nice you know they had respect for the aged day and oh my god there were like twenty others i can't even remember those were like the ones that come to my mind and uh so 

97.25 101.80 B: [lipsmack] perhaps as inspiration from living in japan i would say that 

102.71 109.27 B: gosh if i were looking for a constructed holiday i think something like 

109.57 114.73 B: a sports day or a culture day or a respect for the aged day all those ideas were actually quite nice 

114.83 116.13 A: mhm 

115.62 117.04 B: (( i don't know what do you think )) 

117.89 121.85 A: that well that's cool that they they ce- i guess they that they celebrate 

122.11 127.47 A: pretty much of a they they have a lot of holidays they're not like they're not really holidays but they're 

127.51 128.71 A: but they're uh 

129.80 133.83 A: i guess that they let's call it they sh- they sh- try to celebrate each day 

134.17 135.84 A: a different thing each day 

136.37 141.48 B: yeah it was sort of interesting it was kind of almost you know commo- kind of almost like lifestyle you know 

142.36 150.87 A: yeah 'cause they wouldn't really 'cause they kept i would think that they were like working twenty four hours seven days a week i didn't know that they really had holidays like that [noise] 

150.91 158.21 B: yeah [sigh] i mean it's sort of fascinating because it is true that it's hard to take you know like holiday holiday you know like they got a week or two off at a time people 

158.16 169.62 B: sometimes um are reluctant to do so especially in a difficult economic environment but everybody takes these days off right at the same time so there is no guilt involved [laughter] 

167.82 170.80 A: yeah [laughter] 

170.05 182.11 B: and it it makes for a lot of nice you know three and four day type um weekends throughout the year because these things tend to be spread out all throughout the year there's at s- there's at least one or two a month every month so 

175.32 177.08 A: yeah 

182.28 184.77 B: that really it adds up pretty quickly 

184.83 185.91 B: in fact 

185.11 186.99 A: mhm 

186.21 187.51 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

188.03 191.51 B: so other than that in terms of holidays here 

191.78 197.74 B: i like i said i mean t- for me it's a very family driven thing and um 

197.97 200.99 B: i can't stand the idea of having to buy cards for everybody 

200.75 202.67 A: [laughter] 

201.18 204.04 B: [laughter] personally speaking 

204.56 210.54 B: presents are very stressful although i enjoy doing it um in a weird way it's kind of like a 

209.34 211.20 A: mhm 

211.30 215.81 B: [sigh] satisfaction if i get it it it something really great um 

216.41 221.71 B: in terms of the end of the year holiday thing anyway um gosh what other holidays do i like 

222.80 223.89 B: (( fourth )) 

224.25 225.71 B: july is nice 

226.06 227.07 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

226.11 228.12 B: i like i like fireworks 

228.81 234.23 B: uh i think holidays like labor day and president's day are a little ridiculous 

232.94 235.48 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

234.66 241.44 B: oh you know what holiday i used to really like was veterans' day 'cause it happened when i was a kid it would fall on my birthday 

237.86 238.88 A: veterans' day 

241.74 254.98 B: so i would always get that day off and i would always feel particularly like i don't know special because somehow my birthday i didn't have to go to school [laughter] but then they moved it because it used to be like the third week of october 

241.75 242.70 A: oh 

248.62 249.49 A: (( [laughter] )) 

254.78 256.49 A: (( mhm )) 

255.24 261.35 B: and then they moved it and now it's the second week of november i don't know who decided and how it happened but it did 

261.51 265.81 B: so that was a bit of a giant disappointment plus i don't think most people get it off anymore anyway 

265.68 267.52 A: mhm 

267.55 278.27 A: yeah d- for me i don't normally celebrate holidays so i don't i don't know that much i wouldn't i don't really have much to say about it or i'm pretty much working twenty four seven so 

278.26 279.20 B: wow 

278.36 280.02 A: even on christmas or 

279.91 281.15 B: (( what do you do )) 

280.06 287.40 A: on thanksgiving oh well m- mostly moving moving in computers and 

287.12 289.48 B: you even work on christmas that's wild 

289.24 290.65 A: yeah i don't 

289.62 291.98 B: do you get paid double or something at least 

291.91 297.81 A: no no i i charge the same price it's it's m- it's me it's it's for me it's my own business so 

296.30 297.16 B: right 

297.55 302.53 B: well that's the nature of being your own person right you have to work triply hard have 

299.41 302.09 A: mhm yeah 

302.25 304.12 A: mhm 

303.41 306.02 B: you take- i hope you take weekends off 

306.59 310.57 A: not really mm sometimes i do but it's n- 

306.61 307.67 B: or at least 

310.77 315.80 A: 'cause it because of the moving business that's when everyone moves weekends during the weekends 

315.59 317.33 B: ah that makes sense 

316.39 326.65 A: so weekends end of end of the month the beginning of the month pretty much but weekends and all throughout the week so i'm moving and 

320.21 321.09 B: right 

327.51 328.37 B: wow 

327.68 332.06 A: i'm moving and if if i'm not moving i'm fixing a computer or something so that's 

332.94 336.32 A: like pretty much twenty four seven for me 

336.23 337.88 B: [lipsmack] that's pretty intense 

338.17 340.74 A: so i don't yeah 

338.18 343.27 B: definitely well maybe someday you'll be able to retire rich and have a big long holiday then it 

341.78 342.79 A: [laughter] 

344.35 346.28 B: should be quite nice i'm sure 

344.48 347.94 A: yeah yeah that'll be nice [laughter] 

348.19 350.20 A: i'm just saving up that's all [laughter] 

349.69 351.30 B: oh that looks good 

351.65 357.34 B: that you're saving [laughter] he- out there in the world unlike myself um 

357.84 359.21 B: (( which is kind of terrible )) 

359.32 360.87 B: but um 

359.59 360.41 A: (( [laughter] )) 

360.92 361.73 B: (( so do you )) 

362.10 363.32 B: (( at all or no )) 

363.01 365.71 A: [laughter] do do i it it's it's th- 

365.79 367.82 A: it cut you off do i what at all 

367.07 369.61 B: oh i'm sorry are you religious at all or no 

370.90 378.06 A: somewhat yes somewhat religious and i don't go i don't go to church though but i am somewhat religious yeah 

377.95 381.54 B: well i kind of feel the same way i feel i'm very spiritual but i don't think of 

381.79 385.23 B: organized religion as a requisite in my life 

385.07 385.76 A: [laughter] 

385.58 388.05 B: and uh that's another reason why i'm 

388.18 391.22 B: always kind of annoyed sometimes around holidays [laughter] 

390.80 391.48 A: (( [laughter] )) 

392.44 394.46 B: but not really not totally annoyed 

393.83 396.61 A: well what what area are you calling from 

395.86 400.02 B: um actually i live in new york city and um yeah how about you 

398.02 399.71 A: new york city 

399.99 404.36 A: oh wow that's long distance california [laughter] yeah 

401.54 403.71 B: really oh wow 

404.20 406.93 B: oh my sister's in california are you in l._a. or no 

407.25 413.60 A: no but i do a lot of work around l._a. that's where a lot of the moves are a lot of my moving is it's in la 

413.46 414.37 B: right 

414.24 415.26 A: (( yeah so )) 

415.25 425.53 B: well maybe i should have her call you they're getting ready to move out of their apartment [laughter] ironically well after they have to sell it first but i believe they are having an open house as a matter of fact as we speak 

422.33 424.29 A: [laughter] 

425.63 426.58 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

425.66 429.58 B: um hope it goes well for them it's their first one but 

428.99 431.52 A: they're moving out of their apartment 

430.50 441.07 B: yeah they they live over in um [lipsmack] it's kind of like on the border of brentwood and west hollywood i guess i'm not really sh- uh sure what exactly it is but they're 

436.76 437.73 A: oh 

441.15 448.81 B: they're selling their apartment and then they're gon- and they want to rent instead because i guess it's kind of complicated with the school district thing with kids 

442.86 444.04 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

448.65 450.36 A: mhm 

449.17 460.50 B: apparently it's um it's my understanding that it's not easy to be you have to really kind of live in exactly the right location to get your children into a good public school 

460.41 461.98 A: (( [noise] oh [noise] [noise] )) 

460.86 468.96 B: so um [lipsmack] they have uh they've being paying for private nursery school but it's outrageously expensive i mean it just it's ludicrous it's like 

469.27 483.25 B: practically throwing away money and so they really want to stop that so they think the solution is to sell their uh you know apartment and then rent until maybe prices will come down again because right now they think it's too difficult 

477.40 479.68 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

483.32 485.90 B: and the prices are too high to actually buy 

486.86 491.05 B: now do you do you feel like there are a lot of people that are moving right now or no 

490.74 495.39 A: mhm well half of them half of them are moving to arizona from california to arizona 

495.00 495.88 B: really 

495.45 500.10 A: yeah if well if they're moving out they're moving out to arizona like fifty percent of them are 

500.66 502.07 B: wow 

501.48 505.29 A: 'cause it's it costs too much over in california [noise] 

505.90 507.56 B: that's really interesting 

507.39 511.81 A: like the they're like unreachable the houses four hundred thousand dollars 

511.73 526.32 A: they're there they cost too much and they were just a couple of years ago like my parents bought it like it when it was like one hundred and twenty one hundred and twenty five figures and that was twenty years ago now it's like unreach- even if it's two people working 

519.99 521.89 B: right right right 

525.67 526.85 B: fulltime 

526.55 531.40 A: fulltime th- they they have to one of them will have to be making at least fifty thousand a year 

531.45 533.21 A: fifty sixty thousand a year 

533.57 541.57 A: and um then they could they would be spending four thousand a month on mortgage [laughter] just to get a house in this diamond bar area where i live so 

541.40 542.49 B: wow 

542.71 546.89 B: i hear you well new york is like incredibly expensive i can't afford to buy anything here 

543.12 544.05 A: (( [noise] )) 

546.78 547.93 A: mhm 

547.20 554.47 B: and we actually spend a fortune on rent um but we just can't commit to you know an enormous mortgage it's crazy 

552.53 554.21 A: mhm 

554.57 556.28 A: mhm 

554.68 556.14 B: and um 

556.72 561.04 B: (( [lipsmack] wow half of the people living in but it's so hot in arizona )) 

560.80 562.56 A: (( yeah i know it i don't know why they )) 

562.59 570.72 A: they say it's they say it's nicer and it's [noise] the roads are clean and the roads don't have potholes like all over l._a. 

571.09 583.47 A: they tell me that uh it's really really really cheap [laughter] costs one fourth of the cost of [noise] a condo and i mean more like the uh say the same size house will cost a quarter a quarter of the cost like one hundred and twenty thousand 

583.71 587.28 B: so are we talking phoenix or tucson or or where 

583.92 584.84 A: (( same place )) 

586.95 591.69 A: um i think it's when it's got surprise they they said they're going to surprise 

591.40 592.66 B: surprise

593.32 595.22 B: uh-huh 

594.45 599.01 A: and they said they're moving to scottsdale and surprise arizona 

599.50 599.89 B: wow
