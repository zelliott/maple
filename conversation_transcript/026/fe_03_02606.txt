0.98 2.11 A: hello 

1.41 3.98 B: hello this is christine 

3.65 5.33 A: hi this is brian 

4.90 7.21 B: hello brian so 

6.37 10.81 A: so uh the the subject is supposed to be what we should do about iraq 

10.75 13.80 B: yes and about the disarmament 

14.40 17.63 B: or weapons inspection i guess 

17.33 22.63 A: right but i i think we're a little past i mean the weapons inspections right 

21.96 27.59 B: well i think they're still going on didn't they just find some things recently 

28.27 30.78 A: yes they they are still looking for the 

28.29 29.84 B: i i don't think 

31.01 37.25 A: so called smoking gun these weapons of mass destructions that the war was all about 

36.86 39.16 B: 'cause they never found any really [noise] 

38.61 44.66 A: they got close they every every one every couple of days i've heard on the news that they found something that they thought could be it 

44.09 46.01 B: an empty something or other 

45.73 52.27 A: right barrels of um barrels of chemicals that they thought were it and then later they found out they weren't 

52.38 53.80 A: [sigh] but um 

53.95 59.36 A: i think that considering the expense and and what considering we went to war 

59.50 62.96 A: that they ne- really should find this stuff 

63.29 73.64 B: well exactly it makes our country look pretty ridiculous that we went in there and uh caused so much destruction and still really haven't found much of anything 

73.58 77.95 A: well i always thought the war was a little more than just about that 

77.45 83.89 B: well i i think so too but [laughter] we have to stick to the question here [laughter] 

81.94 89.75 A: [laughter] well that's true well yeah yeah well as the actual question is yes we should uh continue to look for the uh 

90.16 93.43 A: the the weapons of mass destruction 

93.67 94.76 A: um 

95.14 98.44 A: i mean isn't it iraq as big as the state of texas 

98.53 101.34 B: if that maybe it's even smaller 

101.69 108.49 A: so i would think that to be able to go everywhere 'cause it was what news item that said that 

108.68 114.83 A: the chemicals were in trailers that were relocated every six or seven days and 

114.25 115.37 B: mobile 

115.47 117.24 A: mobile right 

116.98 121.73 B: yeah well i mean again you know we're talking about spending a lot of money to do this 

121.91 125.58 B: to make ourselves kind of justify what we've already done 

125.44 130.06 A: yeah well we we've secured their oilfields i think somehow that offsets the cost huh 

129.47 135.28 B: hoo that's the most important thing boy we can just breathe so much easier now [laughter] 

135.24 137.60 A: yeah at the very least um 

138.40 143.91 A: getting the the weapons of mass descru- destruction was necessary but um 

143.88 151.65 B: i was really hoping that they would have found you know some anthrax or some you know real horrible thing to make it seem worthwhile 

151.71 154.69 A: but there were other things they found that were interesting 

154.99 159.70 A: um that guy who had did that terrible thing on the ship all those years ago 

160.11 161.97 A: the terrorist who um 

162.07 167.16 B: oh oh oh uh the uh the klinghoffer incident 

166.60 171.26 A: right i mean they found him i mean to a certain degree 

172.37 179.11 A: right there there was some you know 'cause the way it was presented weapons of mass destruction 

179.16 180.18 A: (( [noise] uh )) 

180.46 183.13 A: also it was about harboring terrorists too 

182.81 189.53 B: that's right and they did seem to flush that uh group out a little bit at least get them on the move 

189.26 191.38 A: and there were training grounds there 

191.51 198.85 A: so even though that was the you know plan a mass destruction weapons i think they were all out of b. cs and ds 

199.17 207.73 B: oh i think so too i think so too and i mean we're going to be there for quite a while um i think it's inevitable that 

207.84 212.84 B: somehow we're gonna come across something or other you know or nothing at all 

212.51 219.71 A: oh i think they won't leave until they find something i mean he sounded so convinced that they were there 

219.78 221.41 B: yeah 

220.79 222.38 A: right so 

223.32 228.05 A: uh you assume that it's more than just the president going on his gut instincts 

229.44 232.01 A: that he had some kind of information 

232.01 235.23 B: that's true and i i would love to be able to see 

235.33 239.27 B: a comparison with some of this intelligence 

239.32 243.99 B: with what actually was f- has been found so far like a score card 

243.96 245.02 A: (( [laughter] )) 

245.58 246.65 A: you mean 

247.70 250.49 A: the actual intelligence to see how well they've done 

250.17 251.41 B: yeah 

251.01 253.20 A: that would be very interesting 

253.51 258.47 A: because when they drop stuff on us like the klinghoffer thing you're saying well did they know he was there 

258.81 263.08 B: that's right or did they just happen did it just happen that 

259.71 260.98 A: and they have these 

262.40 264.56 A: did they just happen across him and they 

263.76 265.61 B: and get lucky yeah 

264.89 270.67 A: and once they round up all these people on these playing cards they'll be telling them where stuff is 

271.00 272.38 B: hopefully 

272.35 275.65 A: um well they won't have much choice i think 

275.12 278.84 B: if they know well they did didn't they find some 

279.80 284.93 B: [sigh] professor or doctor who had some kind of information or something 

284.48 286.46 A: which was the guy they called um 

286.98 288.41 A: baghdad bob 

287.15 290.79 B: doctor death yeah or doctor death or something 

290.35 295.95 A: right i assume he'll be pointing them in the right direction 

295.81 300.33 B: well i i hope for you know our the sake of our country and 

300.58 302.26 B: just sort of being a 

302.39 304.61 B: (( a rel- a noble )) 

304.94 307.18 B: country that they do find something 

307.56 310.43 B: [laughter] that some good comes out of this 

310.68 311.99 A: (( well i )) 

312.14 315.86 A: i you know it's funny i'm not of the opinion that i 

316.17 320.07 A: i think it's some people may think of it interpret it as a desperate act 

320.51 323.96 A: um but afghanistan wasn't enough after the towers 

325.04 330.24 B: yeah i think that people really [sigh] are just so angry at that part of the world 

331.00 340.79 A: well yeah i mean um yeah i would agree with that that there's a big conflict of exactly uh what re- america represents 

340.73 348.33 B: right and and but what about p- other pl- parts of the world you know if we hear that [sigh] um 

348.62 360.34 B: they have weapons of mass destruction north korea for example or whatever you know do we what actions are we gonna take then how much money are we gonna spend to find out if that's really true or not 

360.37 366.00 A: well i think the i think that the amount of money spent is 

367.05 370.46 A: part of the trick bag if if if you know what i mean 

370.85 371.84 A: um 

372.08 373.75 B: (( [noise] no what do you mean uh-huh )) 

372.58 374.99 A: i i mean it's part of 

375.00 382.75 A: okay we we we beat saddam ten years ago right so we didn't go into this war thinking we would ever lose 

382.45 384.80 B: well that's true it was a given 

384.39 391.75 A: it was a given we were going to win it was a given we'd be occupying the land and owning owning his oil during that occupation 

391.44 392.34 B: uh-huh 

392.11 399.56 A: so therefore uh there it was a no lose scenario 

399.65 400.93 B: (( [sigh] right )) 

401.15 406.14 A: now the peoples like the germans and the french who were not thrilled with what we were doing 

406.42 407.58 A: um 

407.94 416.87 A: that was to be expected too i think all of this was thought out in advance we're gonna get europe pissed off at us but we're gonna get this oil and people are going to know 

417.32 420.73 B: [sigh] yeah and i i mean i'm curious too whether 

421.33 425.30 B: this government or one of its agencies might even plant [sigh] 

425.96 430.15 B: say weapons of mass destruction say oops look what we found or 

430.59 435.14 B: they may report things have been found that really aren't true 

434.94 439.95 A: i don't know i would think they would have done it by now if they were going to do that kind of campaign 

439.57 440.85 B: mhm 

440.21 441.96 A: i mean there is no pressure 

442.68 455.68 A: at least i don't see any pressure in the way they the way it's being presented him flying on to the ship and the news conference and all that it's not about we didn't go into it to 

455.56 459.85 A: prove that he had them we went into it to remove him 

460.37 462.57 B: right because he was dangerous 

462.13 463.18 A: right 

462.58 464.45 B: and he might use 

464.48 470.79 A: he might u- he he he had used them um before on his own people against the shiites 

464.65 465.55 B: (( these weapons )) 

469.23 470.17 B: right 

470.37 473.47 B: that's right there was a lot of terrible things that happened over there 

473.51 479.90 A: right so and this guy i mean the things that you reg- you read about what he did killing his own relatives 

479.77 482.59 B: [sigh] oh yeah that was pretty grisly 

482.21 485.67 A: yeah and what i think barbara walters had a special 

485.62 487.01 B: i didn't see that 

486.63 488.10 A: she had um 

488.12 493.02 A: when he took over when the ba'ath party took over um in the late fifties maybe 

493.54 501.14 A: um he was a criminal of the state when he managed to come back into the country and take over with the ba'ath party he had been 

501.44 506.77 A: exiled to egypt for trying to assassinate the leader in in his youth 

507.45 511.09 A: so saddam had been i mean he's a career 

508.02 508.75 B: (( mm )) 

511.18 515.61 A: i don't know what you call it but he's a career dictator 

515.01 516.55 B: yeah that's it 

516.99 519.01 A: and this is what he's always wanted to do 

520.30 524.73 A: so i mean in many aspects the the whole aspect of disarming him 

524.97 529.81 A: no i think once we said we're gonna go to war it's about just getting rid of him 

529.20 531.85 B: true well it seems that we've done that 

531.80 538.92 A: yeah so i think it's success on that level at least by the administration's interpretation of it 

538.71 539.84 B: mhm 

539.92 543.98 A: and then all that money they found in the zoos over there 

543.74 545.35 B: that was interesting 

545.62 546.69 A: yeah i 

546.76 550.05 B: that could really help those people a lot if it's real money 

549.78 552.48 A: (( well it was american money )) 

551.37 553.84 B: but we don't know if it's real it could be counterfeit 

554.24 559.71 A: that's true 'cause there was a yeah i read somewhere that there was about the the counterfeit uh 

560.66 563.47 A: try to destabilize the economy 

565.64 566.77 A: [sigh] 

566.28 575.49 B: i mean i think it's a a terrible part of the world and i i hope that these weapons of mass destruction are not just buried somewhere and 

575.55 579.16 B: they're just gonna sort of explode or whatever they do 

579.68 582.00 B: you know if they're so well hidden yeah 

579.76 586.53 A: well i think weapon weap- weap- weapons of mass destruction i think it's chemical warfare that was the big thing 

586.90 591.91 A: 'cause that's what he had used on the on his experimented with on on his own people 

591.77 595.27 B: but we didn't find any of that stuff really not 

594.48 599.28 A: well not not yet i mean you know i what i saw on the news it's only been forty three days 

599.07 599.89 B: right
