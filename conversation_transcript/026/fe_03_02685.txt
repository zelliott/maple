333.50 345.73 A: [mn] believe it or not i grew up with christmas presents and the way they explained it is that it wasn't because of god it was because of santa claus who was a man that never had children and loves children so on his birthday we get the presents [laughter] 

336.53 338.27 B: (( oh okay )) 

342.17 344.72 B: (( uh-huh oh ooh ))

370.65 371.61 B: (( yeah )) 

371.01 372.53 A: not because of 

372.70 379.89 A: of the events like september eleventh or iraq i just it makes people feel like they wish it they could be with someone that they're not with you know 

378.44 383.21 B: [noise] yeah yeah [noise] exactly i tell ya [mn] m- i 

383.15 384.99 A: it's very commercialized
