12.94 18.19 B: yeah ah bu- because it's such a controversy [sigh] 

16.64 21.81 A: [sigh] i know and i'm just you know [sigh] 

22.80 24.97 A: i've kind of just 

26.05 35.56 A: hidden away from it like i haven't oh gotten too involved in in it like i normally get pretty involved in what's going on around me but i've kind of just not 

35.79 38.93 A: really watched too much of the news and kind of 

38.94 45.37 A: 'cause it's upsetting to me so i kind of just avoid it a little bit [laughter] 

44.56 57.16 B: and do you know my sister and different people i talk to they feel the same way you know my sister said can't look at it i get too nervous and everything [sigh] but it doesn't bother me at all 

49.65 51.09 A: really 

54.54 55.49 A: yeah 

56.54 58.19 A: really 

57.40 59.91 B: it doesn't bother me at all 

59.50 62.62 A: i get really you know i get 

63.46 72.03 A: it scares me and i think it scares me because [sigh] with like the terrorists in which people hating america and i feel like 

72.29 85.15 A: this encourages more of that and then i feel like there could be more people retaliating and coming through and trying to do these little suicide things and stuff and it's just i don't know it's just a scary idea scary 

83.94 96.31 B: right and i heard too give time time and eventually you are gonna see that go on here in the states with those suicide bombers and all [sigh] but 

96.32 107.67 B: i don't for some reason i have a lot of faith in bush because he gung ho you know well he just doesn't talk about it he goes and he does it 

100.43 101.39 A: (( uh-hum )) 

103.35 104.42 A: (( i know )) 

107.43 109.60 A: yeah that's true 

108.23 113.82 B: and i like the way i don't know if you like the way he handles everything but i do 

112.22 113.12 A: (( uh-huh )) 

113.49 116.08 A: well he seems pretty ah 

113.87 114.54 B: be 

116.88 119.44 A: focused and 

119.97 131.36 A: ah he goes after what he wants like he's not wishy washy at all and so i mean you just have to trust him i mean i i honestly like the fact th- that i know that he tries i mean 

131.44 138.34 A: i mean i think he tries to get direction from god and spend time in prayer and that makes me feel a little more confident just because 

138.58 148.66 A: of how i feel about that but i guess that helps me be somewhat confident in him but it's just i don't know it's just so scary and i think i have mixed feelings about the whole thing [sigh] 

148.56 160.94 B: right and ah he's not afraid either to show his faith you know where the different ones said oh he's trying to mix religion and all but he isn't 

154.47 155.74 A: yeah 

160.33 161.41 A: (( uh-uh )) 

161.00 174.72 B: he he just feels this country was really [sigh] ah brought together by faith in god that's why the [sigh] ah words are even on the money and everything in god we trust 

172.04 173.23 A: yeah 

174.03 176.96 A: right right so 

175.28 176.45 B: so 

176.40 190.99 B: but ah i like the way he did it as far as he waited and waited and everybody was saying oh what's he waiting for either go or not go but he i think what he was doing was he was just giving time 

184.29 185.29 A: yeah 

185.88 186.79 A: yeah 

190.60 191.65 A: (( uh-hum )) 

190.96 194.13 B: you know so that we could go in there 

193.41 194.80 A: (( uh-hum )) 

194.18 208.36 B: and all that time that he was taking he was taking the chance ta [sigh] ah really decide ah should we go after them with war should we continue talking what should we do 

204.51 205.46 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

208.01 209.04 A: uh-huh 

209.48 210.71 A: yeah 

209.59 213.03 B: but as far as us disarming them 

213.27 214.47 B: um 

215.00 217.94 B: it's a catch twenty two too 

217.85 219.10 A: (( ah yeah )) 

218.81 225.93 B: you don't know should we now that ah you know they more or less have their country back again 

225.95 227.54 B: should we just 

227.91 232.63 B: you know forget about their arms or what except if they have the 

232.97 234.62 B: chemicals 

235.66 237.66 A: (( [sigh] yeah ah i ah )) 

238.53 240.58 A: [sigh] i mean i guess that was [mn] 

241.06 244.47 A: part of the ah you know with saddam 

244.57 250.00 A: not doing what he agreed to do with the united nations and getting rid of his 

250.03 253.71 A: weapons of mass destruction or whatever i mean 

254.01 256.47 A: the whole plan was to go in there and 

256.49 262.08 A: and get rid of that and check out for chemical warfare and make sure he was going by the agreement but [sigh] 

262.57 267.97 A: i don't know i mean i'm glad it's coming to an end and i i just i hope that 

268.25 274.43 A: they get the right leadership and the ri- i mean th- i don't know it just seems like the country's probably pretty much 

274.82 278.07 A: really in a bad state right now 

278.40 281.98 B: [sigh] and the thing that bothers me too 

278.81 279.87 A: so 

281.87 296.09 B: is ah you have the people there that are all happy and like they're able to have their freedom back again and they've never seen this in years and years and all of a sudden they're getting their country back again 

285.48 286.57 A: (( uh-huh )) 

288.63 289.87 A: (( yeah mm )) 

295.70 296.85 A: yeah 

296.04 304.50 B: but yet you see those ah what we really call them as cells where they're still behind saddam 

301.33 302.49 A: yeah 

304.33 307.30 A: yeah they're extremist or you know i 

307.46 309.58 A: it's just scary because 

310.06 311.87 A: it seems [sigh] 

312.21 313.11 A: like 

313.15 323.26 A: i don't i don't really like to think about it too much because it seems they're so desperate that they're willing to kill themselves for their cause [sigh] and that they hate americans and they 

323.24 335.06 A: [sigh] for whatever reason you know it it seems so easy that they could just come here and you know do something an- and it's just i don't know it's just a scary idea to me 

335.85 342.47 A: that you know these people are out there that are willing to kind of sacrifice everything to 

343.01 354.80 A: make a statement or you know [sigh] do something against americans i think that's why i don't watch the news or i try to avoid it 'cause i [laughter] it's like it just seems like a scary time to me 

354.71 356.25 B: [laughter] right [sigh] 

355.68 357.09 A: yeah 

356.56 358.50 B: and i think what ah 

358.52 366.39 B: makes me so it doesn't bother me is just like bush is always talking about faith i haven't got a faith 

364.28 365.27 A: uh-huh 

366.18 367.29 A: yeah 

366.88 373.09 B: and i always feel from the moment we're born we're really born to die 

372.59 374.54 A: yeah oh yeah 

373.28 383.23 B: and i think that part of living is all part of a school and part of a scheme getting our spirit ready to go to the other side 

377.24 378.29 A: yeah 

379.18 380.18 A: (( uh-huh )) 

382.63 384.58 A: yeah yeah 

383.41 389.80 B: and ah i think once you feel in your mind that you're ready to go which i am 

389.30 391.17 A: uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh 

390.15 399.89 B: and i'm one of those people i'm ah called the re-entry you know i'm part of a source at university i don't even go up there i'm in the archives up there [sigh] 

399.34 400.47 A: in the what 

400.57 406.66 B: in the archives you know where people can look up my name and get in touch with me and everything 

404.56 405.40 A: (( oh )) 

405.90 407.73 A: oh wow 

407.10 414.40 B: because i'm a re-entry and that's a person that had the life death experience you know 

413.02 415.35 A: oh really 

414.52 417.59 B: where you die and you come back again 

417.06 420.53 A: what did you ah what did you experience 

420.11 429.50 B: oh god you i even go to these bible studies now and the fellow there he always says oh phyllis tell your story 

429.19 430.58 A: did you see heaven 

430.79 431.93 B: yes 

431.99 433.16 B: and what 

432.25 433.67 A: did you see jesus really 

433.63 445.65 B: what happened it just changed my whole life and the one thing that we do have in common you know when i used to go to those meetings is we're all looking forward to dying 

442.40 443.35 A: (( mm )) 

445.70 447.62 B: and i can't wait 

447.42 450.04 A: so it was beautiful it was wonderful 

449.62 452.61 B: it was and what happened 

452.32 455.67 A: oh my goodness amazing i totally believe in that 

452.67 455.07 B: when i first ah 

455.87 463.27 B: when i when i first ah had the experience i wound up in pitch blackness 

462.95 464.59 A: wow 

464.00 472.70 B: it was so black black that if you put your hand in front of you because i remember i tried doing that you couldn't even see your hand 

466.22 467.43 A: yeah 

472.29 473.76 A: oh my goodness 

472.70 480.82 B: and instead of all the creatures like they say is in the other side there wasn't any of that there wasn't any voices 

477.34 478.36 A: yeah 

480.73 483.54 B: there was just me and myself 

481.67 482.71 A: (( darkness )) 

482.94 483.94 A: uh-huh 

483.42 490.64 B: and that's what scared me knowing that i'd be in all eternity in just that black pit 

488.95 491.08 A: yeah right 

490.49 499.22 B: and no at least if you heard creatures or something you'd know somebody's in the darkness but there was nothing [sigh] 

498.50 500.17 A: then what happened 

499.57 506.20 B: and then all of a sudden i saw a little little tiny light like a a pin the head of a pin 

504.37 505.58 A: (( uh-huh uh-hum )) 

506.37 508.03 B: and um 

508.40 514.16 B: [lipsmack] i had i headed toward the light and all of a sudden i was in that ah

528.33 529.46 A: wow 

530.14 531.66 A: right right 

530.46 543.64 B: but i recognized her and i was so happy and i started [sigh] to go toward her and all of a sudden i zoomed through and shot out the other end and at the other end i was before this light 

535.42 536.31 A: (( uh-hum )) 

539.68 540.61 A: (( uh-hum )) 

543.25 544.31 A: (( uh-hum ))

548.03 549.18 A: (( uh-hum )) 

555.95 564.66 B: when when i thought to myself oh my god i'm with god like i just knew it i knew it ah within my heart that that's where i was
