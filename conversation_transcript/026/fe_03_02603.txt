0.50 2.65 A: hi my name's melissa 

2.64 4.45 B: hi my name is amy 

4.08 6.25 A: [laughter] um 

6.42 8.51 A: actually the topic's kind of a little 

9.08 10.97 A: outdated i think [laughter] 

10.29 11.51 B: yeah [laughter] 

12.26 18.53 B: although i mean i guess technically they're still doing inspections it's just that it's us doing them now and not the u._n. 

18.15 19.93 A: [noise] true true true 

19.65 23.84 B: i i think they're calling them searchers now instead of inspectors but 

23.25 26.99 A: yeah yeah well i think they'll probably get more done 

27.29 32.31 B: i don't know actually i actually think it's sort of ironic because before the war started uh 

27.39 28.38 A: [laughter] 

32.19 43.73 B: you know every- the the people who were anti war were asking the bush administration to give the inspectors more time to find the weapons and now that the war's over and the administration's the one looking they're the one that says they need more time 

38.84 40.05 A: mhm 

43.71 52.78 A: yes true true true it's kinda yeah that is true well the whole thing has been kinda close to home my husband's in the navy so 

52.73 54.79 B: is he actually over there or 

54.20 56.19 A: no he's going 

56.30 57.73 A: going soon 

57.69 58.52 B: ooh 

58.12 60.82 A: but uh so i'm kinda like 

59.24 62.25 B: well at at least he's going now that it's all over but 

61.65 64.68 A: yes yeah exactly i was like oh thank you 

63.32 65.42 B: do you know what he's gonna be doing over there 

65.37 67.39 A: um well he'll be on a ship 

67.18 68.25 B: oh okay 

67.41 69.39 A: so he will just be 

69.45 71.30 B: the harbor patrol or 

69.83 73.83 A: kind of yeah exactly kind of sitting out there in case 

73.96 78.24 A: [laughter] in case they don't let them do what they need to be doing over there 

76.79 77.95 B: [laughter] 

78.50 81.82 B: no i don't really think there's anybody to stop them at this point 

78.64 79.62 A: so 

81.35 83.04 A: ex- yeah true 

82.53 88.58 B: it's really just a question of you know if anybody knows anything finding out who they are and what they know 

88.31 100.52 A: yeah you know i i heard on the news about them like burying them and it's like i wonder i don't really know too much about what kind of equipment and what kind of things they can do to 

101.08 106.24 A: to find those types of things unless p- people will actually come forward and tell them 

106.29 108.92 B: i i mean that's assuming they exist at all 

108.33 110.25 A: y- true true true 

109.10 116.11 B: you know i mean there's not there's not really any evidence that they still exist at all the only evidence is that they once existed 

115.87 125.53 A: yeah yeah which which hopef- you know and plus they've said you know they think that they those that did exist they may have even moved out of the country 

125.07 130.68 B: right that's true they were they were all all that talk about uh things being smuggled into syria 

130.12 138.21 A: mhm and i mean we have no jurisdiction to go over there and search syria [laughter] so we may never find anything 

137.01 137.57 B: (( [mn] )) 

138.40 145.79 B: i don't know i mean we didn't we didn't have any more jurisdiction to go into iraq really doesn't seem to be stopping us 

143.01 145.36 A: this is true yeah we just kinda 

145.86 151.27 A: yeah this is true of course i think we're already looking as at like the bully 

151.17 152.19 B: yeah 

151.57 157.82 A: right now i don't know that they wanna be traipsing all over there saying we're just gonna 

156.25 163.82 B: but you know i'm i'm sort of afraid that if it does work out somebody's gonna get it in their head that what a great idea this was we should keep doing it 

163.41 170.89 A: yeah true true if they find anything i think they're a little bit desperate though [noise] because they haven't really found 

170.39 180.22 B: right and they're starting to look they've egg on their faces now 'cause they were insisting that the whole reason they were going over there was 'cause of these deadly weapons and then if they don't find 'em 

178.34 186.82 A: these deadly chemical weapons yeah and and really they haven't found anything you know i mean they've found some weapons with traces and 

183.94 185.39 B: yeah they found 

186.03 190.56 B: what what did they find like a jug of pesticide and [mn] 

188.75 190.21 A: yeah 

190.23 199.74 A: or or you know a bomb [noise] that they think had traces of some kind of chemical that could have been a chemical weapon and it's like well now they're feeling like 

198.00 203.99 B: although apparently most of the bombs they've found were american bombs that we sold them in the seventies and eighties 

201.32 202.23 A: (( mm )) 

203.76 208.96 A: exactly yeah it's like mm okay [laughter] we're finding 

207.92 210.42 B: going over there to get our stuff back 

209.64 217.61 A: exactly what did we do here so now they're kind of i feel like they're kind of in this desperate search to find something 

217.50 218.55 B: right 

217.78 219.69 A: so that they don't look like 

220.70 223.13 A: stupid you know [laughter] 

222.13 223.29 B: yeah 

223.51 229.99 A: so that's kind of i i i don't know do you really think like that they will find anything i kinda feel like 

230.59 233.08 A: they've we've been over there and 

230.89 232.20 B: i kinda feel like 

232.52 236.77 B: yeah that if if there was anything to find they would have found it already 

236.14 238.73 A: yeah i really do i do too 

236.90 237.77 B: i mean 

237.85 243.94 B: they've they've been searching for what like a month now in addition to all of the inspections that went on before 

240.58 241.70 A: yeah 

243.58 251.20 A: yeah there was inspections that went on before and there were inspections well in the last war you know there was inspections then 

248.64 249.52 B: yeah 

251.27 260.03 B: and you know even when there weren't inspections going on we were still you know flying over the country and taking aerial photographs and spying on them and 

258.91 265.96 A: yeah yeah so either i don't know either they're not telling us something you know they know 

266.20 269.21 A: more than they're letting the public know or 

266.54 267.58 B: right 

270.13 276.33 A: or there's just you know it's been moved i just don't really think that they're gonna find anything if they haven't found anything yet 

276.69 285.18 B: [mn] it seems to me though that if they found something it's not like they're gonna keep it from us because it makes them look bad not being able to find anything 

284.67 287.04 A: [noise] yes true true [noise] 

287.06 290.02 A: it's just kind of i don't know i think it's 

290.14 296.74 A: i i i know that we need to be over there we need to and i feel we need to be over there more helping 

297.01 298.06 A: correct 

298.26 300.25 A: all the damage that we did 

300.44 304.80 A: with the bombs and things and getting them help to set up a 

304.88 305.95 B: yeah 

305.35 307.09 A: society so that they don't 

307.37 310.64 A: fall into all the looting and stuff that they've been having 

310.79 311.84 A: and 

311.16 324.82 B: but i mean ultimately a lot of that took place because of poor planning on our part quite frankly i think there just weren't enough people on the ground to prevent them you know to actually keep the peace while the invasion was going on 

316.40 317.45 A: yeah 

320.79 322.27 A: to stop that yeah 

324.26 325.65 A: yeah 

324.92 337.55 B: i mean you ended up with all this looting of museums and stuff and you know i saw on the news the other day that apparently the director of that museum had like asked the americans to guard the museum and and we didn't do it [laughter] 

336.33 338.78 A: oh jeeze yeah 

338.84 339.43 A: (( [laughter] )) 

339.68 348.21 A: thanks [laughter] you know i'm sure it's what they're thinking so i don't know i think i don't think that the inspections should even be the priority any more 

348.36 355.23 A: because if they're gonna find anything [noise] it's gonna be through i don't think it's gonna be through searching i think it's gonna be through 

354.68 358.25 B: right they'll they'll find it in the course of uh 

355.26 356.20 A: people 

357.49 358.26 A: of 

358.47 359.62 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

358.63 363.71 B: rebuilding or of you know getting to know people and setting up a society there 

363.48 367.57 A: exactly people are you know people are gonna be more willing to say 

367.74 370.47 A: hey this is what i know 

370.75 375.09 A: when they don't feel like we're this horrible tyrant that's come in and 

375.06 376.02 B: yeah 

375.15 381.89 A: bombed them and ki- you know what i mean i think they will get what they want through the people not through searching 

381.94 392.95 B: yeah i mean it seems to me that at this point you know the iraqis were glad to have us but their attitude now is thanks for saving us now go home so that we can start our own country 

390.46 391.68 A: [noise] go home 

392.62 395.40 A: yeah i i think they've probably had enough of us [laughter] 

393.31 394.13 B: and i 

395.43 409.44 B: yeah it seems like it's time for us to sort of back off and you know help them you know maybe something like something like what we did with the japanese after world war two helping them write a constitution and figure out how they wanna set up their government 

406.82 407.92 A: mhm 

409.34 413.72 B: but you know we have to start treating them as equals rather than as a conquered nation 

413.52 417.16 A: yeah yeah [noise] i think it's time more to have 

417.19 426.15 A: peace corps and red cross and and missionary groups coming in instead of so much um the military too 

425.57 430.71 B: although on the other hand if you send in missionary groups there's like a a cultural sensitivity there 

429.76 432.47 A: yes that's true not necessarily 

432.23 439.26 B: religious missionaries but but there oh there are all sorts of n._g._o.s that are willing to go over there i mean uh you 

432.89 435.03 A: religious missionaries yeah but 

438.32 440.79 A: yeah yeah like you know 

439.60 445.68 B: know habitat for humanity does that kind of thing and you know human rights watch 

441.90 443.15 A: mhm 

444.03 447.56 A: peace corps and human rights yeah yeah yeah 

446.24 447.17 B: yeah 

447.98 451.39 A: and yeah i think it's more humanitarian 

451.57 460.96 A: stuff is what's needed yeah more than than than the military presence and the inspections 'cause i really don't think they're going to find anything that way 

451.76 453.83 B: that's what they need right now 

457.86 458.87 B: yeah 

461.62 467.37 A: you know after after all this time and everything that we've done if they haven't found it they're not going to 

463.05 464.09 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

470.37 475.38 B: i mean you never know things sometimes just turn up but you're right i think i 

473.33 474.28 A: true 

476.53 488.73 B: mean to be honest sort of you know even before all of this i was i was skeptical that you know the weapons really existed to the degree the bush administration wanted us to believe they did 

486.55 487.68 A: [noise] thought they 

488.03 490.60 A: yeah or thought that they were 

489.00 490.18 B: (( you know i think )) 

490.37 493.58 B: yeah i think it was more of an excuse than anything else 

494.39 499.25 B: they they wanted to get in there and and get rid of some evil dictators and 

498.63 504.98 A: yeah i you know and and i don't i don't disagree i don't think that that uh 

505.35 508.90 A: saddam hussein was a wonderful leader for the people but 

508.15 518.79 B: i don't think anybody thinks that i mean you know no matter how against the war you are i don't think people really think that saddam hussein is you know the ideal leader for any country but 

509.67 511.39 A: yeah and but 

517.49 523.32 A: [laughter] yeah and but then you gotta you know it's like okay 

524.10 528.57 A: [noise] i i don't know i i feel the same way i feel like well 

529.28 533.60 A: did you wanna get rid of him or did you wanna get rid of weapons 

533.82 543.42 B: or alternatively did you wanna get rid of him so that you could get oil i mean you know it it sounds trite but it's it's a legitimate concern it's the reason we went in the first time 

544.04 553.60 A: [noise] yeah with the pr- well the protection of the kuwaiti oil too yeah whereas this time we weren't really protecting anybody except 

547.61 548.69 B: right 

553.61 555.46 A: them and and us 

554.82 555.96 B: yeah 

556.10 558.30 B: sort of protecting them from each other 

557.86 559.06 A: yeah 

560.18 561.86 A: and i don't know that 

561.90 570.34 A: they feel like we did that i know there's a lot of people that think it's it was all over oil but i think there was more to it i don't 

567.40 568.31 B: yeah 

569.81 578.57 B: yeah i mean obviously i don't think it's as as uncomplicated as any of the you know protest slogans make it sound on either side 

576.88 580.12 A: yeah yeah yeah true 

580.43 582.20 A: [sigh] i don't know there was 

583.26 591.60 A: [noise] we we've bombed so much and i you know i figured with if they had anything i thought they would have retaliated with it [noise] 

591.18 599.95 B: yeah i mean there was there was really no reason not to it wasn't like they they they were gonna win you know much as the information minister got on t._v. 

594.32 595.00 A: (( [noise] )) 

597.49 598.69 A: yeah
