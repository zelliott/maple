8.70 9.90 A: yeah 

10.47 20.74 A: oh i had someone in california um i didn't know what the topic was 'cause my husband answered the phone and he didn't realize what was going on and then when i got it got onto the phone 

12.58 13.87 B: [sigh] 

20.75 26.02 A: i had a- accepted it but i didn't know what it was but now and now i guess it's about holidays right so 

22.77 23.73 B: [laughter] 

25.69 33.81 B: yeah it's what's your favorite holiday why an' if you could make up your own holiday what would it be and how would you celebrate it [laughter] 

33.44 34.42 A: huh 

35.00 36.97 B: okay what's your favorite holiday 

36.61 40.03 A: i guess christmas is my favorite holiday 

40.74 43.48 B: okay mine is halloween [laughter] 

42.63 46.06 A: okay and why is halloween your favorite 

46.53 56.25 B: uh 'cause it's a totally make believe made up kinda day you can be anything you want you can be nice you can be funny you can be 

57.08 58.75 B: drastic i mean 

58.75 59.74 A: right 

59.11 63.94 B: you can just kinda go all out and it's all pretend 

62.66 63.73 A: right 

64.37 69.07 A: i mean i like giving out candy and stuff like that [laughter] on halloween i i know 

67.04 68.69 B: [noise] 

69.35 70.39 A: um 

70.99 78.44 A: christmas has just always been like a real like special family time like always growing up and everything 

78.46 80.40 A: just the time like we would always 

80.53 88.17 A: bake cookies and just do things like me and my mom and me and my dad and so and my dad passed away so it's kind of like 

88.45 92.57 A: i don't know i just that time of year it's for family for us but [mn] 

93.86 96.43 B: so it's a good thing for you it's a special thing 

95.91 97.85 A: it's a special thing right 

97.73 111.78 B: see christmas is not a good holiday in my house [laughter] we [laughter] don't get along i especially don't get along with anybody at christmas and we've always had huge fights like every christmas for years and years 

100.66 101.91 A: okay 

111.33 112.92 A: oh my goodness i 

112.86 121.68 B: so it [laughter] it it's not a real good time and even if everybody's being nice it's always like okay when are we going to start fighting 

113.39 115.91 A: can see why that's not your favorite [laughter] 

121.30 123.81 A: oh that's terrible 

122.61 134.70 B: so it it's not really a good holiday here but we're thinking of trying to celebrate it differently like maybe go to the zoo or something and just hang out and enjoy the animals being there or something 

134.06 135.16 A: right 

135.05 137.71 B: and my family's not religious either so 

137.88 138.90 A: okay 

138.10 142.12 B: that aspect is not part [noise] of any celebrations we have 

141.31 142.62 A: (( oh i see )) 

143.17 148.18 B: [noise] which you know i know can make a big difference depending on the peop- the person 

145.40 146.59 A: right 

148.03 149.95 A: right 

150.13 154.54 A: the other part of the question is is trickier in terms of what holiday would i 

154.62 156.07 A: create [laughter] 

155.44 156.36 B: [laughter] 

156.33 159.64 A: that i i don't know i've never given too much thought to that 

160.30 161.57 A: (( but )) 

161.04 164.30 B: neither would i but i would probably have like a 

164.72 167.43 B: celebration of animals kinda day 

168.06 181.00 B: i i'm sure there's something out there that covers it but nothing that i know of that's promoted [laughter] you know go out support your local zoo volunteer at a shelter something like that respect other living creatures 

173.43 174.53 A: (( okay right )) 

181.88 191.25 B: that kinda thing um i like animals a lot and i like to work with them and i think a lot of kids and adults don't really get enough exposure to them 

181.89 182.68 A: i mean 

190.74 191.95 A: mhm 

191.29 195.11 B: so i think that would be a good thing and maybe help promote understanding 

195.49 197.23 A: that sounds good 

197.73 201.35 B: i don't know i i would like to participate in something like that 

201.97 204.28 B: i always try and do things for 

204.99 210.12 B: like with the lesser known holidays like arbor day and earth day and stuff 

209.40 210.58 A: (( yeah right )) 

210.77 217.13 B: you know work in my yard fix the flowers i mean just something that kind of everybody can share in 

214.50 215.85 A: i mean on earth 

216.92 218.03 A: right 

218.26 227.87 A: on earth day like do they have anything organized for people to like go out and clean up in their neighborhood and things like that or not really 

222.38 224.59 B: [noise] 

227.25 236.56 B: they did something in central park but i'm not exactly sure what they did i did i went to something in the botanical gardens which was a little after the fact 

236.30 237.35 A: okay 

236.96 248.76 B: and it um they had like different information tables and different planting societies and things to answer questions and promote brightening your area and showing you how to compost and things like that 

247.79 253.05 A: right because i i would probably come up with some kind of day like 

253.60 267.24 A: cleaning [laughter] that type of thing for for nature because like even just today we went to a park in our neighborhood and i- it's there are a lot of geese there and things like that and there's just so much junk that people throw into the water and 

267.69 273.75 A: you know now i have a small baby so i can't really um go and pick up the garbage 'cause i have to watch her but 

273.76 278.61 A: before i had her i would always go and pick up the litter around there 

278.84 282.08 A: when just when i was hanging out at the park during the day 

279.29 281.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

282.40 285.51 A: i just hate to see that you know the a- the 

285.69 291.05 A: ducks and everything are living there and there's all plastic bags and things in the water 

287.31 288.56 B: (( yeah )) 

290.83 297.41 B: and it's dangerous to them and that's their home so people need to respect it they wouldn't throw it around in their own home 

292.71 293.67 A: yeah 

297.22 303.79 A: no and people like like there are signs not to feed them but people do anyway like a a lady was feeding them bananas today and 

304.42 305.69 A: so i don't know 

306.60 309.52 A: but i i guess it would be something like that 

309.77 312.20 B: (( [sigh] )) 

310.59 316.84 A: it's ju- i mean it and it it's a nice neighborhood too where you would think that people don't do that but they do it everywhere 

314.03 315.35 B: (( [laughter] )) 

318.84 319.85 A: (( so i don't know )) 

320.98 323.45 A: i can't really think of anything else 

323.55 326.70 A: any other [laughter] kind of a day that they don't already have 

324.12 325.64 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

329.27 330.61 A: (( like i'm not sure )) 

331.91 333.76 A: do you have any other ideas 

333.75 334.69 B: (( um )) 

335.96 343.59 B: i pretty much think it would wind up being something animal based if i was working with it or if i was the one planning it 

339.03 339.95 A: animal 

344.56 345.59 B: um 

346.78 349.34 B: 'cause we have all kinds of 

349.56 353.15 B: religious holidays and different 

354.64 360.92 B: folk based holiday holidays from different cultures which i guess are based on other religions and we have things that are 

354.90 355.84 A: (( right )) 

361.64 375.20 B: um just based on cultures themselves already [laughter] i mean being in new york we get to celebrate a lot of holidays other places don't [laughter] 'cause we can both go celebrate st in two days [laughter] and 

365.02 366.06 A: right 

369.37 370.80 A: sure sure 

372.51 374.07 A: [laughter] right right 

375.46 380.78 B: around here no one cares whether or not you're status you can celebrate but i'm sure maybe people in 

380.94 384.27 B: wisconsin don't get that same opportunity we do [laughter] 

382.66 383.86 A: (( right yeah [laughter] )) 

384.41 386.65 A: yeah we definitely do have 

384.93 385.94 B: but 

386.47 393.95 B: there's a parade like every week now for some group or other and it's always kinda like come on out celebrate learn [laughter] 

388.13 389.65 A: [laughter] 

393.04 394.06 A: (( yeah )) 

394.17 397.89 A: well you must like the halloween parade that they have 

398.32 400.31 B: (( um it's kinda fun )) 

400.12 405.47 A: yeah i it i mean i've never been there but i've seen it on t._v. and it looks like 

404.28 413.11 B: it it's very casual it's kinda like if you want to join in join in this is where we start if you want to just watch from the sidelines watch 

405.58 406.39 A: they're 

412.86 415.02 A: the costumes are amazing though 

416.13 417.78 B: [laughter] well that's 

416.81 418.76 A: you know people go all out 

418.29 421.41 B: yeah that's the fun part [laughter] 

419.69 420.98 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

423.09 428.04 A: and no i look forward to halloween for my daughter she's only eleven months old now but um 

427.00 427.86 B: [laughter] 

428.19 434.70 A: i look forward to that 'cause my mom would always make our costumes from scratch and stuff so i look forward to doing that kind of thing 

434.77 443.76 B: see i think that's what another reason i like that so much 'cause we really didn't do a lot of straw bullet stuff we made a lot of things so that was a family holiday to us 

440.62 441.68 A: right 

443.22 449.93 A: yeah yeah it's so much better when when you make the costume than when you buy it 

448.29 450.45 B: (( [laughter] )) 

450.05 456.01 A: you know you just feel like more pride and stuff in wearing it it's just 'cause of so much went into to making it 

453.11 454.81 B: (( [laughter] )) 

455.41 460.08 B: and it's truly yours it's not like yeah i'll take the mass produced spiderman outfit 

459.45 467.51 A: right and look like everyone else in the block yeah it's true and we still have some of the costumes that we made 

467.02 469.06 B: [laughter] so do i. [laughter] 

468.68 473.54 A: it's funny 'cause we have pictures of like everyone in our family wearing it at some point when they were younger 

473.77 476.09 A: just maybe my daughter will end up wearing 

476.62 478.44 A: the one that we 

476.74 479.21 B: that would be a nice tradition 

478.87 480.34 A: yeah 

480.68 481.56 A: funny 

483.61 484.81 A: i [lipsmack] i don't know 

487.34 488.49 A: (( kind of )) 

489.32 491.43 A: (( not much more to say really [laughter] )) 

490.79 499.04 B: and if there was nothing if if it had to be something more structured than that i would do something silly like okay fine it's 

499.30 505.25 B: celebrate the muppets day let's bring the muppets back and you know 

504.46 506.00 A: right right 

505.72 511.60 B: something like that just something very wholesome enjoy it don't think about it too much 

511.19 512.40 A: mhm 

512.52 516.33 B: just spend a day thinking happy thoughts kinda holiday [laughter] 

516.03 517.39 A: yeah 

518.06 521.67 A: and a uh well so many holidays are so commercialized 

522.16 528.48 A: that y- you know how when you go into the store and like it's five months before a holiday and 

527.07 530.68 B: [laughter] august twelfth and ho- and christmas is up 

530.08 532.00 A: yeah it's terrible 

533.06 538.42 A: it it's like some things get passed over like thanksgiving always gets passed over 

539.46 551.17 A: you know 'cause the halloween stuff is out and then it's like it skips right to christmas and thanksgiving i mean i and i guess it's because people don't give gifts and things like that so the stores don't really care too much about it 

549.07 550.06 B: [noise] 

551.42 552.57 A: but [laughter] 

552.42 556.62 B: but it's important 'cause that's the day you're supposed to just be with your family 

555.93 558.04 A: mhm 

558.48 559.92 A: (( i don't know )) 

559.59 570.50 B: see we do that we try and go to the parade together and eat together that day and stuff and we'll put out flowers and you know if there's friends around we'll say hey come on over for desert or to eat or 

563.86 565.32 A: mhm 

570.84 571.83 B: you know 

572.15 573.65 B: (( just come )) 

572.32 580.08 A: yeah i mean it's genuinely just about people being together and being happy for that opportunity to be together and 

580.54 581.84 B: exactly 

580.58 581.35 A: (( you see )) 

582.32 585.95 A: and somehow that that one gets the least attention [laughter] 

586.45 587.68 A: (( i don't know )) 

589.03 590.53 A: (( very strange )) 

592.89 594.89 A: in terms of these calls 

595.87 599.89 A: th- they told me that i could only do three of them or something
