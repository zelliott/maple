0.78 2.73 B: [lipsmack] hi i'm mike 

2.69 5.03 A: oh i i'm mike as well 

4.77 9.25 B: [sigh] all right well at least we will at least we will mm 

6.36 7.48 A: mike where where 

7.51 9.05 A: are you located 

9.08 10.47 A: where are you located 

10.25 12.04 B: ah near chicago 

12.02 15.15 A: okay i'm in ah i'm in evansville indiana [sigh] 

15.53 18.82 B: okay so just about three hundred miles south 

16.38 17.63 A: (( we [noise] )) 

18.46 19.66 A: yep 

19.37 21.07 B: (( [sigh] and ah )) 

20.18 23.33 A: well the the topic's a little outdated isn't it [sigh] i 

22.76 26.56 B: yeah i'd say it's a a little outdated ah we sort of 

25.74 27.67 A: thought we already disarmed 'em [laughter] 

27.05 31.54 B: [laughter] yeah we sort of know how this came out [mn] um [lipsmack] 

31.88 39.36 B: so um [sigh] i'm a little surprised 'cause i thought i was only gonna be -e called three times and this is already my fourth so 

39.47 42.40 A: yeah we've been called quite a few times actually 

42.49 47.33 B: [sigh] [sigh] yeah so ah may be they're getting a little out of control here and 

45.92 47.52 A: [noise] well like 

49.12 55.37 A: [noise] i mean i don't ha- have a problem i guess we can do a precursor discussion abou it if if you're into that if you want to discuss it 

55.45 56.61 B: yeah sure 

57.22 63.03 B: um you know i i don't really know that the topics have anything to do with anything other than ah 

63.09 65.64 B: [sigh] i think it's a linguistic study 

65.12 66.34 A: (( okay all )) 

65.73 71.07 B: ah so they just want people to talk and they need to have them talk about something 

71.08 73.10 A: right then do you want to change the topic 

73.13 78.91 B: [sigh] um do you have a topic handy or we can talk about iraq now what they should do ah either one 

78.95 82.88 A: well i i'm comfortable with with either if you want to stay on the same ah 

82.90 85.89 A: if you want to stay on the topic that they already introduced [sigh] 

86.64 93.48 A: i'm comfortable with that if you want to begin the conversation [sigh] what what's your opinion what do you think should happen with the government in iraq 

93.05 98.76 B: [mn] well i think ah that they're gonna need to get out of there as soon as possible 'cause ah 

99.20 109.21 B: [sigh] i don't know exactly how they're going to set up some kind of stable government but [sigh] i'm afraid we're [sigh] likely to be suicide bombed and demonstrated to death 

109.32 113.95 B: [sigh] you know what happened the other day with the thirteen ah people who ah were 

114.32 126.93 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] ah well either accidentally killed or killed on purpose or we were responding to people shooting you know in in any kind of crowd situation it's really kind of hard to tell what really went on [lipsmack] 

126.93 130.42 A: i i agree with you i'm i'm a little concerned with 

130.58 143.29 A: i i understand your point of you know our number one concern should be the americans and the welfare of the americans being over there [sigh] um but then i guess you had to look at the point of and it's surreal to me the the realism of it is 

143.07 153.83 A: kind of hard for me to grasp because i'm not there and i've never been there so it's it's really something that i can't really put in in realistic perspective but i will say 

153.76 162.06 A: [sigh] we we did go over we did what needed to be done to take care of mr saddam hussein [sigh] and now we 

162.39 170.81 A: not that they were in a good position to begin with but we've disrupted life in iraq and i think that we do have some some sort of responsibility to help 

170.92 179.25 A: rebuild not all the responsibility but i do think we have to contribute to it does that mean that we should put american lives at risk i guess that's that's the major question 

178.85 187.93 B: [noise] [sigh] yeah and the p- part of the question is how the heck we get out of there with i mean [mn] you don't want to leave chaos you you're absolutely right [sigh] 

179.33 180.27 A: and 

187.79 198.12 B: ah but w- you know the longer we're in there the more you know risky it is and the more likely that ah you know the troops will be a target and [sigh] you know these are [sigh] 

198.29 213.26 B: i mean i i you know they're highly trained military guys on the one hand [sigh] on the other hand you know my neighbor's kid is over there and he's like you know nineteen um and you know i still think of him as like a nineteen year old kid [lipsmack] except [sigh] 

212.29 219.48 A: that's a perspective i can't have i don't i don't know anyone that's over there so it's hard for me to put it in that of 

219.58 233.04 A: [sigh] you know i don't know anyone so it's hard for me to say that but [cough] i do i i agree with you i i think we have to be careful of american lives and that that should be our number one concern that's why we went over there to straighten things out [mn] um 

221.76 222.91 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

233.41 246.96 A: but what what's going to happen to the government of course you hear all the rumors that an an and i'm tired of hearing the oh we just went over to take over the oil um [laughter] obviously that's the that mentality i i don't agree with 

247.51 249.74 A: but i do think that [cough] you 

250.10 257.19 A: know we we got to be careful because now iran wants to go in there and take over or iran however you want to pronounce it they want to go in and take over 

256.88 257.74 B: (( uh-huh [lipsmack] )) 

258.06 271.77 A: so i i think there is a a bigger picture than what's really been drawn and now now does this leads us into syria now we're going to have to go over there and and put our our military force on them next i don't think it's going to stop with this 

271.64 276.82 B: yeah [sigh] and you know that's kind of unfortunate it's kind of hard to figure out how 

277.09 282.80 B: [sigh] you know how y- you know we had afghanistan this year and i mean last year 

283.22 289.50 B: (( [sigh] and iraq this year and ah you know it gets a little thinner all the time )) 

289.19 299.53 A: i mean and the middle east has been a mess for a while [sigh] and it we've pretty much stayed out of it and we've tried to keep it in check but i mean let's be quite honest nine eleven is when they invited us over 

299.40 309.36 A: [sigh] and if they wouldn't have if they if that didn't happen and anybody who tells me that there's not more involved than just um osama bin laden and afghanistan then 

309.45 317.95 A: i i don't if i can agree with that because i do think there's there's a lot more going on over there i think there is a conspiracy [sigh] in the middle east against the west 

318.43 323.06 B: uh-huh [lipsmack] well there's a lot of frustration you know they ah [sigh] 

323.78 331.30 B: we're an easy target 'cause you know i- it's easy to blame them the countries that are materially more successful 

331.70 338.13 B: [sigh] ah it does seem like you know considering how much oil wealth they have they haven't really 

338.45 340.06 B: (( [sigh] um )) 

340.56 350.14 B: you know succeeded in building ah or you know a modern society as much as you might think given the you know the amount of money they've you know they've had to play around with over there 

350.54 351.66 B: (( [sigh] so )) 

350.58 353.00 A: ah that's that's that's definitely true 

352.76 354.09 B: (( and ah )) 

354.14 360.02 B: [sigh] so i think you know blaming it on the u._s. is more convenient than trying to um 

360.16 366.23 B: [sigh] you know figure out well what's wrong with the overall society and and ah you know how can they 

366.43 370.75 B: get you know get their own society moving you know we're a nice target 

370.72 385.32 A: and they're not going to be able to do it that's [sigh] that's why i think maybe we we can help 'em but i do i do expect us to benefit from it from the oil we should benefit from it if we're going over there [sigh] and trying to fix the problems that they have 

385.20 386.99 B: (( [mn] uh-hum )) 

387.84 388.60 B: (( so [lipsmack] )) 

389.31 391.75 B: so we're kind of in violent agreement here 

391.79 396.88 A: yeah and so it it would be better i guess if we disagreed because then the conversation could really get heated 

396.27 399.74 B: yeah we'd have a more heated conversation [sigh] ah 

396.93 398.30 A: [laughter] 

398.73 401.58 A: okay so let's disagree about something are you a baseball fan 

401.82 402.88 B: (( [lipsmack] ah )) 

402.99 411.32 B: well a little bit a little bit you know more so in the spring than any other time 'cause th- the cubs haven't you know gone down to the last place yet 

405.00 406.03 A: okay so [sigh] 

411.20 413.74 A: well yeah the cubs are playing real well right now 

413.28 414.58 B: yeah 

414.09 425.06 A: see my wife's from chicago and her family's from chicago so [sigh] i and i i'm an atlanta braves fan so i like to razz them a little bit about it but hey dusty baker's doing a great job for the cubs right now 

424.85 433.24 B: yeah and ah but you know they they often start off good in the spring and then just kind of fade away so 

433.12 434.88 A: then how long have you been in chicago 

434.63 438.41 B: ah since seventy eight so about twenty five years 

438.00 445.17 A: so you you you yeah you've definitely experienced all the ups and downs so you you never you never went to the other side and watched the white socks though 

441.28 442.20 B: yeah 

444.93 451.38 B: ah yeah i i been you know [lipsmack] i used to go to the old socks park but they built a new one 

451.40 458.83 B: ah i've never actually you know gone to a socks game since then even though that's been oh ten years anyway i guess [sigh] 

458.89 462.46 B: you know the the ball park gets kind of negative reviews [sigh] 

462.86 464.57 B: (( and ah )) 

464.71 469.21 B: [sigh] you know in a way the socks aren't you know as interesting 

469.38 474.73 B: and it's hard to say exactly why yeah you know i don't i don't really know why 

473.48 477.01 A: well i think it's because the cubs have so much character 

476.76 485.95 B: yeah and they got you know they got the cute little ball park and they got the ivy there and you know it's right stuck in the neighborhood so ah you know 

486.10 488.74 B: that's kinda neat so how long have you been in evansville
