15.99 17.72 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

17.74 20.63 A: so we're talking about disarming iraq 

20.08 22.18 B: (( shh yeah )) 

21.25 25.35 A: well do you think that ah we should make that a top priority 

25.63 27.53 A: [laughter] for the united states [sigh] 

27.73 28.77 B: i do 

28.92 33.36 A: really why you sound like you have a have a very strong opinion about it 

29.52 30.88 B: personally 

32.71 33.71 B: i do 

33.69 35.28 A: why's that 

35.01 37.36 B: why is it mm 

35.82 37.00 A: yeah 

37.95 41.19 B: just because of the danger to 

41.43 46.92 B: the entire world you know i don't [noise] think that 

47.29 58.22 B: it's in anybody's interests for us not to be aggressive about it really how do you feel about it 

56.41 57.70 A: (( [noise] well )) 

57.73 58.91 A: i guess [sigh] 

59.69 67.18 A: i i guess because there are dangers all over the world there are many dangers that we should could make priority and ah i guess 

65.33 67.07 B: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

67.78 79.27 A: i i have kind of mixed feelings about it i think that there are other motives for [sigh] going for iraq as opposed to other [sigh] nations and and other even internal threats here in the united states [sigh] 

78.05 79.24 B: oh okay 

80.49 95.35 A: so um [lipsmack] i don't know i'm not sure that i think that our government is is is always looking out for the best interests of the majority of the people in the united states when it chooses these [sigh] um targets 

96.18 100.53 B: [noise] i guess i'm i have a it's probably just a 

100.43 111.48 B: hope or a belief that it would be for the right reasons [noise] you know i guess i take that for granted so i do ha- i do have those concerns also 

105.48 106.64 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

111.35 116.09 B: but i think personally i'm still more 

116.59 117.61 B: um 

119.96 122.93 B: for it definitely [laughter] [noise] 

120.94 122.10 A: (( [sigh] [noise] yeah )) 

122.45 134.04 A: well do you think that after this war we should go after other nations that have um probably been develop developing [sigh] ah weapons of mass destruction or other arms that could be 

134.34 136.75 A: nuclear weapons other other other um 

136.75 139.98 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

137.36 139.92 A: threats in the the world [laughter] 

140.12 141.04 B: (( [noise] um )) 

141.81 144.72 B: i'm not sure about that 

143.65 147.68 A: yeah see that's sort of the question for me why stop why stop at iraq 

147.27 150.09 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] mm [noise] [noise] )) 

148.14 152.78 A: is there a is there a a a reasoned difference 

153.05 154.55 A: (( is there a a )) 

154.63 157.90 A: difference that has some logic behind it 

157.86 160.62 B: one big difference is all of the 

161.10 165.76 B: all the chances he was given you know just a flat out 

165.99 166.91 B: um 

167.54 174.22 B: defiance and just the way he was to his own people that's what sticks out in my mind more than anything 

174.40 176.79 B: what he did to all those people 

177.34 182.93 B: [noise] the families the i mean i can't i don't even know the numbers i don't remember but 

182.94 185.50 B: i know it was outrageous 

185.73 194.12 A: yeah yeah that i mean i i i agree with you there were atrocities there in ir- in iraq and and and elsewhere in the world unquestionably 

194.25 195.59 A: unquestionably 

195.62 201.29 A: things go on that [sigh] would horrify us probably if we knew the extent of it 

202.00 208.25 A: but i think by the same token there are things going on within our own borders that would horrify us if we really knew 

207.73 209.51 B: (( [noise] [noise] there are what )) 

208.98 210.79 A: there there there are 

210.80 214.57 A: are horrors happening here in the u._s. that would that would that w- 

213.14 214.19 B: true 

214.58 216.27 A: if we really knew 

216.41 219.14 A: [laughter] the things that are going on here and 

218.45 219.54 B: right 

219.38 221.99 A: if we were really aware of [sigh] of 

224.37 225.64 B: [noise] and i do 

225.03 236.48 A: ourselves and if we were a more peaceful nation i think i think we'd be more justified in being the world's policeman but i i just don't i don't think we're a peace loving people [laughter] frankly 

236.48 240.18 A: i'm not sure we're in the best position to to be the 

236.59 237.61 B: oh okay 

240.36 246.54 A: the decision makers for the world especially when there's so much opposition from other nations 

246.12 248.05 B: (( [noise] right )) 

247.20 258.88 A: and the u._n. to us going forward [sigh] i i don't think that we have any great moral authority ah any any greater moral [noise] authority than any other country we [noise] haven't demonstrated i think to the world that we 

259.18 261.25 A: [sigh] are the best 

261.83 272.19 A: n- nation to decide [laughter] [sigh] you know what's how much is enough you know because it it i it was hm i'm sorry i i'm dominating [laughter] the conversation i think 

266.51 267.66 B: (( right [noise] [noise] okay )) 

271.01 272.86 B: no i'm listening no 

272.94 276.72 A: because i it was a u._n. it was u._n. sort of 

276.73 278.43 A: (( [sigh] [noise] um )) 

279.89 284.73 A: ah deman- demand ah the disarmament initially was 

284.87 287.46 A: and [noise] the u._n. 

287.55 301.01 A: ah was inspecting [noise] for the arms and [sigh] the u._n. just didn't really back this effort of ours to enforce the disarming [noise] requirement so 

301.30 306.53 A: i just think we should have stepped out an- and and i want i just suspect the motive [noise] [noise] [noise] 

306.67 308.15 B: [noise] what um 

309.37 318.73 B: what i always think of when i [laughter] hear the u._n. is my husband told me that we actually started the u._n. the united states 

320.69 322.93 B: i didn't know that 

322.99 324.37 A: [sigh] well i mean 

323.30 326.18 B: [noise] and i just can't believe now that 

326.19 332.04 B: the the u._n. is not in agreement at all with us 

332.00 337.43 A: [noise] well i mean it's it's a group of of [noise] independent nations like any other group of 

336.68 337.59 B: right 

339.47 340.70 B: [noise] so what 

339.61 347.41 A: [sigh] [noise] who who have each have their own opinions and justifications and rationales [noise] for things that they do [noise] and their own perspective [noise] 

348.74 355.50 A: so i mean it's it's a world body as opposed to a a single country decision [noise] 

353.09 354.06 B: right 

356.02 357.53 B: i do know that i 

358.24 361.84 B: i guess if you had to choose between like iraq 

361.86 368.01 B: an- being a priority and our own hungry people being a priority yeah 

367.47 369.40 A: [noise] [noise] or south korea 

368.95 370.70 B: (( [noise] uh-hum yeah )) 

369.49 378.92 A: [noise] [noise] or syria [noise] [noise] or you know any any other hot spot in the world or israel and palestine [laughter] [sigh] 

376.36 377.70 B: (( [noise] right )) 

377.93 380.51 B: that's oh yeah 

378.81 386.83 A: [noise] yeah we've been [noise] how many years have you been hearing on the news about palestinian and israelis killing each other 

386.54 388.72 B: oh yeah 

387.45 394.95 A: how how many years how many years have you been hearing about that and [lipsmack] we really haven't i think [noise] done a lot [noise] 

395.42 397.65 A: to really help bring peace to that region 

397.83 409.95 B: [noise] there was um a lady that made a statement after nine eleven about you know this has happened in our country every day of our lives for you know like you were just saying 

409.85 418.56 B: and nobody ever made a big deal out of it and now you lose this many people and you know you expect everybody to feel this way or i 

420.04 428.71 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] yeah i i you know actually [noise] thinking back on it i hadn't really thought about that for a long time but i think [noise] i did kind of feel the same way [noise] [sigh] 

429.75 436.11 B: mean i i didn't you know i forgot about that myself i was guilty of it you know myself not 

436.52 440.17 B: you forget we are so fortunate here i do 

437.37 438.26 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

441.72 444.80 B: i do like it that bush wants 

445.42 449.82 B: other people to have what we have the freedoms that we have 

448.94 452.51 A: [noise] [noise] but i mean does he really want that i mean does do you really do you do 

451.92 453.73 B: i hope that he does 

452.40 462.95 A: you see him as a compassionate person who really wants who really cares about the freedom of iraqis to choose their own leaders i mean when you when you 

462.84 469.33 A: watch him on television and listen to his addresses you really get that feeling from him [sigh] [noise] that that's what he cares about 

465.19 467.02 B: (( yeah right uh-hum )) 

469.19 472.16 B: i do [laughter] but
