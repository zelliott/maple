19.79 28.26 A: uh i don't know it just said that uh i was gonna have another person on here and we're supposed to talk about uh disarming in iraq or something uh 

27.23 37.71 B: disarming in iraq yep that's what i heard as well i just it's funny 'cause i had just sent in my signed up on the internet today for today at four so i was just surprised to get a call 

37.74 39.05 B: so quickly 

38.96 43.42 A: i think i signed up a day or a day or two ago it didn't take very long 

41.78 47.04 B: oh okay they're just waiting for people to have partners so uh 

47.24 49.50 B: i guess the question is uh 

49.87 50.78 B: do we 

50.87 58.08 B: favor dis- if iraq if disarming iraq is important for the u._s. was that the question 

58.25 59.57 A: uh i believe so 

59.25 60.25 B: okay 

61.01 62.32 B: so uh 

62.61 64.15 B: at this point in the 

64.20 70.85 B: scheme of things with iraq it doesn't seem like they've found many weapons to disarm them of 

71.12 74.78 A: um really honestly i don't think that really matters 

75.23 77.22 A: at this point i mean 

76.22 80.70 B: no not at this point i don't know if the question was uh posed 

77.65 78.68 A: um 

81.47 85.32 B: at what point in the [laughter] the war in iraq 

81.49 82.51 A: uh 

85.26 86.87 A: yeah uh 

86.82 99.09 A: really as far as disarming 'em i think setting up any kind of stable government whatsoever over there is the most important thing whether we find a smoking gun or not um you know for 

98.94 102.63 A: peace throughout that entire area um 

102.83 109.29 A: i don't see any any any reason to not go ahead and finish the job whether we have proof of uh 

109.61 112.12 A: [noise] chemical weapons or whatever 

111.54 114.38 B: no i think you're right it's more important to 

114.52 115.85 B: establish 

116.45 117.73 B: some post 

117.92 125.07 B: uh saddam hussein government and you know let the people of iraq get their lives back 

125.24 127.04 B: underway and 

127.90 129.80 B: and continue [noise] 

130.77 136.62 A: well i mean what and and really i mean we're looking at what kind of uh 

136.54 145.40 A: what kind of life we're gonna bring to that area you know just uh you can you can look at uh what we did in uh 

145.20 155.41 A: japan and germany and you know whether whether you like the way it ended up or not they they both have stronger better economies maybe maybe even better than what the u._s. has 

152.52 153.88 B: that's true 

155.81 165.00 B: [laughter] yeah that's true especially probably in germany when it comes to healthcare coverage and and more uh 

157.01 161.31 A: (( currently )) 

165.60 167.14 B: don't they have like a 

167.76 171.29 B: month of vacation uh every year or 

171.41 173.62 B: they don't they don't seem to quite 

173.79 175.64 B: work is not quite as 

177.44 182.51 B: the center force as it is in america though and japan i'm sure that's the the opposite 

182.99 186.37 A: well yeah japan is [laughter] is uh 

185.70 186.77 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

186.64 189.96 A: capitalism on steroids but um 

190.40 193.28 A: you know as as far as being um 

193.74 202.44 A: uh becoming a world power and having a voice and being more um on an even kilter rather than extreme one way or the other 

202.49 213.05 A: uh the only way i think the middle east is ever gonna find any kind of peace is if we have enough of it that's at least stable where the people that are in control don't vary from day to day on their 

213.31 227.78 A: i i mean you you you're talking about a part of the world where they have religious wars that have been going on long before america was ever established we're kind of like the young punk coming in and trying to tell 'em how to run the world when they've been around considerably longer than we have 

219.71 221.31 B: yeah it's hard to 

226.85 228.10 B: (( yeah that's definitely )) 

227.72 233.02 A: but whenever the u._s. steps in they usually end up better off in the long run so 

233.07 236.47 A: that's kind of a hard hard call to make 

235.86 238.24 B: yeah definitely so what part of the 

238.78 240.74 B: country are you in are you in the 

240.87 241.84 B: u._s. 

241.04 242.08 A: texas 

241.85 243.21 B: in texas 

242.85 244.11 A: yeah 

243.48 247.82 B: yeah i'm in california been rained on for 

248.38 253.65 B: [noise] many days here this month we've had record uh rain uh 

254.16 255.58 B: fall so 

255.45 258.18 A: that's unusual for that area isn't it 

256.51 258.69 B: [laughter] it sure is 

259.34 264.61 B: so uh i wonder how long we've been talking for here [laughter] 

263.56 265.33 A: uh i don't know 

265.07 268.12 B: we're supposed to talk for ten minutes so 

267.39 268.26 A: okay 

268.49 269.97 B: what uh 

271.24 274.19 B: i was reading in the paper about iraq that they're 

274.30 284.82 B: trying to get people that have had escaped to the united states to go back over to iraq and and and be a part of the rebuilding of uh 

284.84 288.83 B: the government that seems seems like a a good idea a 

289.01 290.16 B: good source of 

289.23 290.39 A: um 

291.45 298.23 A: well it's it's kinda hard to tell uh we didn't have any or it doesn't seem like we had any kind of uh 

298.60 299.57 A: um 

299.96 302.45 A: established understanding of who's 

302.49 316.07 A: where and what their positions were i mean that's kinda something that uh the military has to has the ability to get in there and find out exactly who was in charge of what and who's responsible for what and i mean it's 

305.42 307.37 B: yeah it's true like they didn't 

314.79 315.80 B: yeah they didn't 

317.19 322.17 B: they didn't keep track of or didn't publish very much information about what was going on 

322.26 326.59 B: in the country as far as how many like their census like there's no 

326.78 329.73 B: idea of the numbers of people and 

326.86 328.37 A: well i mean right b- 

329.42 335.07 A: right because it's all government run so you know again a reason why it would it's a good idea to 

335.24 341.46 A: um completely disarm 'em so that the same guys that were thrown out don't get back in 

341.00 342.83 B: exactly yeah you never 

341.86 343.61 A: but it's 

343.68 347.79 A: for for the majority of people that you meet in america i mean you may 

348.27 358.30 A: be you may watch the war coverage constantly um like many of the people i know do um but the the real problem is a lot of people in america think it's just a big you know desert 

358.34 361.62 A: you know baghdad is just as big as you know 

361.71 376.18 A: dallas or san francisco or you know anywhere you know around the country as far as you know having computers and established businesses and all that which which a lot of people don't they don't have that in mind when they think about that part of the world 

369.43 371.27 B: (( yeah i know definitely )) 

374.86 383.70 B: well yeah they're they're generalizations of what it what it's like and deserts and tents in the sand and that kind of a [laughter] 

382.29 386.80 A: it's hard to it it's hard to picture it if you haven't been there 

386.51 389.68 B: yeah i i have never been to the middle east so i 

389.75 392.13 B: i have no idea but 

392.63 394.20 B: definitely uh 

394.71 400.38 B: and it's it's a lot huge billions of population wise i don't know how it compares to 

400.60 405.31 B: the united states but it seems just what i was reading about it it seemed like it was it 

402.07 403.83 A: yeah 

406.73 408.41 B: was much bigger 

407.42 410.03 A: well it's a you it's a 

410.89 416.70 A: you know it was a it was a full working government you know the the question is what kind of government are they gonna end up with 

416.84 423.66 A: after you know all all of this you know what what kind of system will be set up i think that um [lipsmack] 

417.63 418.81 B: afterwards 

424.19 431.87 A: you know the biggest thing that you know the military went in they did their job they took the people out of power that needed to be taken out of power but they still have 

432.09 437.48 A: some responsibility to not just leave 'em high and dry like we did basically before 

437.23 442.32 B: yeah no definitely not is are you referring to the persian gulf war 

442.71 443.83 B: yeah that 

443.31 446.23 A: (( yeah )) 

445.00 445.75 B: (( i i )) 

447.25 460.18 B: didn't realize i mean you you knew it was so short but then that's true being it's so short is that it was just they just went in and asserted power but then didn't do anything to help solve the 

447.57 448.40 A: i mean 

460.52 462.12 B: the situation as 

461.92 470.68 A: well all all the all the same guys even crippled had you know went directly right back into power as soon as you know the u._s. left so 

469.47 471.82 B: soon as the u._s. pulled out no that's 

471.12 475.93 A: so that i mean that's something that's that i mean that i i think is more important than 

476.35 477.89 A: i mean we know we have 

478.22 483.10 A: the military power to go in wherever we want to but what we do with that power 

483.26 487.48 A: a- afterwards is is a lot more important than what actually is uh 

488.30 494.81 A: we do you know currently i mean it's not like we're conquering countries and moving in and trying to take over we're just 

494.11 498.10 B: yeah that we're a far far cry from that so 

498.55 503.78 A: you know not that we weren't at one time but [laughter] but apparently we're better anyway 

500.62 502.42 B: no definitely not 

503.29 507.20 B: [laughter] yeah well let's hope that they uh 

507.35 508.87 A: so anyway 

507.67 509.74 B: use the powers to benefit 

510.69 514.61 A: so is this thing supposed to just shut down at ten minutes or 

514.27 520.92 B: i'm not sure i i think it's going on ten minutes because i think the call came in pretty much at four o'clock 

520.87 521.86 A: (( oh okay )) 

521.24 531.51 B: and my son answered the phone and he's just sitting there holding the phone to his ear and i'm like okay who is it and then but they're kinda set up for that situation so you 

525.60 526.84 A: [laughter] 

527.04 528.56 A: (( [noise] )) 

531.56 535.72 B: it puts you on hold kind of so then you can return to the call 

533.74 535.45 A: (( yeah )) 

535.92 541.21 A: (( okay well i don't know i don't know if we got anything settled [laughter] )) 

537.28 539.19 B: so uh i wonder what they'll 

540.07 547.29 B: [laughter] well uh i don't know do you think we could we have to wait for them or i think they said that a re- recording 

547.91 549.28 B: would come on 

549.50 550.69 B: (( in ten minutes )) 

549.68 554.31 A: uh this this is the first time i've ever done it so i'll know next time what's gonna happen i just didn't know 

554.35 555.20 B: yeah 

554.56 557.42 A: for sure this time what the what the deal was 

557.69 571.31 B: [noise] well it's an interesting uh it's i didn't i was had no idea what kind of questions that they would give you but i guessed it would be something that that would be a current event and a subject of 

571.90 575.87 B: you know sort of that everybody would know about and 

575.47 582.00 A: i i figured it would be more of an interview process where they would just ask questions you know like a survey 

582.06 583.93 B: yeah i know it was i 

582.35 584.02 A: type type deal 

584.09 596.14 B: i as i read further into it i'm like oh this sounds like you're gonna be talking to someone and and maybe even multiple groups of people like you could have more than two people on on the line 

596.10 597.94 A: yeah 

596.62 599.14 B: so are you driving in your car 

599.12 599.95 A: yeah i'm
