20.30 24.33 B: i'm fine i didn't hm okay [laughter] 

20.42 21.19 A: (( [noise] a [noise] )) 

23.65 24.63 A: what 

24.99 28.31 B: well i figured that is is this one of these survey calls 

28.18 31.77 A: [noise] yes it is a- actually did you actually hear the recording at the beginning [noise] 

32.31 36.15 B: sort of yeah i just didn't uh gosh okay 

35.44 37.49 A: did it catch you off guard 

37.07 41.95 B: yeah because i figured it would be to ask questions you press one for whatever and you 

42.46 44.18 B: um [cough] it's kind of 

43.22 45.76 A: [noise] so did you hear what our topic is 

44.23 45.44 B: (( a [laughter] )) 

45.79 49.76 B: yeah something about holidays [laughter] i 

47.30 52.68 A: [laughter] something about holidays [noise] well it's it's yeah [laughter] exactly no it's that um 

52.77 61.12 A: it's something like if you've uh you have a favorite holiday or if you wanted to create if you were able to create a holiday what would it be 

62.10 65.95 A: hm so i guess let's take the first question what is your favorite holiday 

66.00 69.50 B: (( don't know [noise] um i don't know i guess christmas i mean )) 

66.39 67.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

69.37 71.07 A: [noise] christmas 

70.20 71.70 B: sure [laughter] [noise] 

72.38 74.08 A: [noise] [laughter] not thanksgiving [noise] 

74.50 75.32 B: no 

75.68 78.55 A: christmas is better because of the presents [noise] 

76.94 77.77 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

78.34 88.88 B: well just as a big yeah in our h- house thanksgiving is a fa- is a family time but i think you tend to reach out more to people with cards and everything at christmas so yeah christmas 

82.95 84.76 A: mhm 

89.04 99.87 A: oh okay that yeah that's that's true because for other holidays you don't really like send out a lot of cards [noise] i guess right you're just kind of get if you get together you get together 

95.94 97.41 B: well you're not really 

97.51 98.67 B: right 

99.72 104.85 A: [noise] um if you don't then [noise] but yeah i guess yeah you're right i never thought about the difference between christmas 

104.67 111.10 A: because my first thought was oh well thanksgiving [noise] because it's a family holiday and you know everybody gets together 

110.86 111.96 B: mhm 

110.91 121.20 A: [noise] but um what you just said about the cards is it makes sense because not everybody can get together but at christmas even if you can't get together then you just send them a card [noise] [noise] 

119.73 125.79 B: yeah and no matter you know how far across country they are i you know it's generally the time i i do anyway 

121.93 130.29 A: and it's cheaper to send a card for thirty seven cents than it is to fly across country to meet somebody for thanksgiving [noise] 

129.68 130.82 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

130.26 131.56 A: [laughter] 

131.55 133.45 A: right [noise] 

133.46 147.38 A: um well i guess my favorite holiday would be like i said thanksgiving i guess because a lot of it has to do because i come with a from a large family so and we're able to get a lot of us get together and and celebrate it that way but [noise] 

142.16 143.12 B: mhm 

147.33 151.83 A: i don't know if that would have been my favorite holiday if i were like you know from a small family 

153.20 155.55 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah mhm )) 

153.61 155.65 A: do you have any other holidays 

156.64 160.05 B: (( [noise] um not not on and i don't know )) 

160.14 161.62 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

160.38 166.08 A: how 'bout holidays in the summer time when you can get out and do stuff have fun 

163.09 164.38 B: holidays in the 

168.34 170.48 A: like uh fourth of july 

168.70 170.08 B: (( [noise] i don't know i think )) 

171.21 172.16 B: well 

173.40 176.05 B: actually i like halloween [laughter] 

175.19 178.36 A: halloween is fun too do you have kids 

178.07 184.30 B: [noise] no but we usually you know have a- an event at work and it's you know and we're 

178.45 179.77 A: [noise] no 

182.59 183.57 A: okay 

184.47 189.80 B: kind of we're all encouraged to do costumes and we have contests amongst 

187.53 188.74 A: (( oh okay )) 

190.07 191.52 A: amongst your coworkers oh 

191.22 192.81 B: (( um [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

192.46 193.58 A: okay 

193.21 196.30 B: [noise] yeah so it's it's you know it's a lot a it's 

195.01 196.25 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

196.56 200.04 B: probably different than all in a lot of workplaces i guess [noise] 

199.82 208.68 A: but it takes a lot of effort for halloween though i mean it's a good holiday but it it seems to me like it takes well it's different i guess 'cause for thanksgiving everybody has to do something i'm sure 

208.44 209.61 B: right 

208.60 213.18 A: so especially like if you're having a family over or whatever [noise] but um it's it's a 

213.11 224.55 A: i don't know i yeah halloween is fun i used to do like a haunted house uh my house uh for the kids in the neighborhood [noise] so it was fun too but it was a lot of work 

224.54 233.47 A: and okay i'd still rather enjoy thanksgiving than halloween but i think really 'cause other men don't have to cook or bring anything 

233.38 241.48 A: no sorry i enjo- i say i think i enjoy uh thanksgiving better because i don't have to cook or w- worry ab- [laughter] yeah exactly you know 

233.58 234.43 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] sorry )) 

238.69 239.94 B: or bring it [laughter] 

240.44 242.47 B: yeah [laughter] 

241.31 251.16 A: or on thanksgiving like you know it it it was that expensive to have to fix my house for all those kids and get everything for them so [lipsmack] but halloween is fun too 

250.61 251.78 B: mhm 

251.62 252.18 A: (( [noise] )) 

251.98 266.05 A: you know another holiday that uh [noise] because i lived in latin america for a long time that another big big holiday there is um the day of the dead or the day of all saints and it's like a big national holiday where people go out to a 

266.02 273.11 A: cemetery and you just spend the whole day there like you actually bring like a picnic have you ever heard anything like about it or do you know much about it 

274.80 277.25 A: [noise] like has anyone ever mentioned it to you 

277.10 279.06 B: (( mhm no not really not recently mm )) 

278.47 293.15 A: okay well the way we used to celebrate it i remember with my grandma 'cause my grandfather died when i was a little kid so we used to go and like we used to k- have like i said a picnic [noise] and celebrate like i don't know whatever you celebrate at a cemetery like we would clean the [lipsmack] 

292.98 302.38 A: the tomb and everything and like bring fresh flowers and actually eat that person's favorite food so it's like a big big holiday there but here it's not 

302.27 312.51 A: you know it's not anything big i mean i guess in more ethnic communities like i'm from latin america they kind of do something about that but uh overall it's just like a a cultural holiday 

312.31 322.14 A: you know somewhere else in the world i guess [noise] but anything else you wanna say for holidays 

314.33 315.35 B: mhm

401.22 402.15 B: (( ahem )) 

402.42 406.77 B: i know we have labor day but maybe an employees day would be nice [laughter]

407.32 409.81 B: you know hey [laughter] i mean 

409.89 413.04 B: everybody is one in one sense or another 

411.08 424.01 A: [laughter] yeah well you know i here in well you know in california we have like a lot of state holidays but i guess that only applies if you're like a state employee um like i know that you said like just a childhood's day 

420.61 421.65 B: right 

424.29 431.06 A: and um and here in l._a. i don't know about sacramento but here in l._a. um like cinco de maya is like a huge thing 

424.65 425.76 B: right 

431.23 440.85 A: um and it's not really a holiday but a lot of people pretend it is so you know you don't go to work and you do other things everybody is sick on that day [laughter] but they're not they're out celebrating and stuff 

441.07 445.99 A: [lipsmack] but uh to create something in between february and may hm that's interesting 

446.29 447.82 A: employee day 

448.00 455.25 B: that's i don't know it just came to mind i don't know what else could do the only thing that i could think of any because i don't know of anything of insig- 

448.13 449.21 A: um 

450.29 453.28 A: (( right right )) 

455.33 457.23 B: of significance in 

458.25 461.10 B: between [laughter] 

459.35 467.14 A: yeah 'cause i mean you know we have like i would say set holidays we have like pretty much [noise] one that honors 

467.29 474.56 A: you know something or somebody like we have president's day we have well what's labor day labor day is not for people who work 

476.98 485.89 A: but it's still too far into the year huh [laughter] we still don't have that leaves us out something in between uh february and may [noise] [mn] 

482.73 488.51 B: yeah it is still it's getting closer to memorial day but [laughter] i know it just seemed like there should be something 

485.94 487.88 A: right 

489.27 490.22 B: (( mm )) 

490.23 492.16 A: mm interesting 

490.59 494.52 B: well that's my idea [laughter] you know i don't know what the heck 

492.35 494.14 A: yeah 

494.45 499.88 A: and i agree with you because [noise] i didn't realize i wouldn't have a holiday between between those months 

500.01 505.39 A: [noise] so i maybe i have something there [laughter] i don't know what do you do to create a holiday [laughter] 

505.50 511.30 B: well i know when i want it that's for sure [laughter] 

507.66 519.31 A: [laughter] yeah [noise] that's interesting let's see if i wanted to if i because when i heard the question i started thinking well if i were to create a holiday what would it be 

519.14 527.23 A: but um like i was just telling you they i- i- i- i- we it seems like we have a major holiday just about for everything or everyone that we need to 

527.10 534.25 A: commemorate i guess [noise] like i guess thanksgiving and christmas would be like for famil- well christmas would be for family 

534.34 536.97 A: times thanksgiving would be for like i guess 

536.95 549.84 A: you know appreciating things and showing that [mn] labor day would be to a day of rest um is easter a holiday no huh it's just a religious holiday 

549.25 551.57 B: it's a more religious holiday and [noise] 

550.88 552.94 A: yeah 

553.11 557.54 A: um [lipsmack] then we have president's day 

558.20 562.44 A: then we have fourth of july holiday to celebrate the the nation 

563.19 564.21 A: um 

564.51 569.38 A: i don't know i i was trying to think [noise] of what is still missing to 

569.39 571.73 A: commemorate or to celebrate and i guess 

571.91 578.72 A: employee day [laughter] employee day in the middle right in the first quarter of the of the year would be nice [noise] 

578.25 580.04 B: yeah yeah why not 

580.10 581.03 B: (( [noise] as you said )) 

580.38 586.14 A: but you know have you ever read those things where it says like how many like holidays there are in a year 

586.17 599.89 A: and like at the end of the year like supposedly you have had more time off because the holidays than than you have actually worked but it's not true of course because if that were the case have you ever re- do you know what i'm talking about you know i've never i've never 

595.43 597.22 B: [noise] [noise] oh that is definitely 

598.57 599.40 B: (( haven't )) 

599.45 599.89 B: (( se- ))
