43.55 52.31 A: celebrate celebrate the the holiday and basically celebrate ourselves as family and the spirituality of it all and you know where i live it snows so 

52.36 65.59 A: um you get the whole white christmas scenario [laughter] and you know and i've got kids so it's just that you know this is the tree and the presents and trying to get them to go to bed on time oh it's just it's funny

79.81 87.42 A: this is that you know i appreciate you that's i guess the best time to do it if you haven't done it you should do it everyday i think but 

87.54 89.72 A: that's the best time i think 

89.55 91.67 B: it's also a time where 

91.70 92.59 B: um 

92.60 94.56 B: you talk to people or 

94.68 104.04 B: you've kind of like keep keep contact with people you don't normally like you know you send christmas cards to somebody that you wouldn't normally that you don't see everyday or talk to everyday 

98.77 100.26 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

103.38 105.08 A: right right 

104.11 105.92 B: (( whatever and [noise] it's )) 

106.18 115.97 B: just a good way to let people know you care about 'em you know it's the one chance you get to buy somebody something if they want you know i wanna get 'em something and that [noise] 

109.65 110.48 A: (( mm )) 

115.14 118.88 A: that's true that's true i i'd do that as well if you know i- if 

119.00 132.19 A: you know you may not talk to that person for most of the year and yet you know i need to send 'em a card let 'em know i'm still alive [laughter] i'm still here and i'm thinking about 'em so yeah that is a good way if you could think of a holiday what what kind of holiday would you create [noise] 

124.04 125.05 B: yeah 

132.41 133.32 B: um 

134.01 135.84 B: it's a tough one i really 

135.57 138.99 A: [laughter] i know me too [laughter] 

136.11 137.01 B: [laughter] 

137.20 139.88 B: (( yeah i don't know )) 

140.86 142.01 B: um 

143.73 145.53 B: i don't know what 'bout you [laughter] 

145.03 147.02 A: (( [noise] [noise] me uh )) 

148.15 155.48 A: i don't know it's kind of hard to say if well we've got arbor day and earth day and we've got all of 

154.52 156.46 B: (( i know that's hard there's so many of them )) 

155.87 159.50 A: [laughter] yeah i know i don't think we you know 

159.88 166.49 A: other than it it i wouldn't necessarily recreate a holiday but i would like more 

166.44 170.77 A: you know like i said christmas is my favorite holiday [noise] i think i'd like 

167.25 168.12 B: (( [noise] )) 

170.55 182.55 A: more to happen with the holiday like you know you you have times that people are still warring or fighting at christmas that might be the one time they might decide not to or 

182.74 197.38 A: they might decide to kind of tone it down a little bit you know i think that would be a time i would i think i would i would like to see true peace on earth where you know there weren't a lot of conflicts where where people could actually sit down and think about what they're doing you know 

197.73 202.61 A: so i i guess i would i f- i would try to find a way to increase it not necessarily 

202.67 215.55 A: create another day for it 'cause believe me i think we have days for everything [laughter] just you know it's a difficult thing i just think i would take a holiday or like mother's day or something take a holiday and kind of um 

207.64 208.73 B: yeah 

215.58 220.79 A: do a little more to it something that we have never fully achieved and try to achieve for that i guess 

222.75 225.35 B: and then easter is a good holiday too 

224.55 226.80 A: [noise] [lipsmack] oh right right 

225.76 227.39 B: easter's really nice 

227.10 229.86 A: easter's very nice it's a very that is 

229.93 230.83 A: (( um )) 

231.01 232.99 A: in my opinion i i think 

233.07 235.67 A: [noise] more people are um 

237.10 245.65 A: uh it's more spiritual to me in that realm you know i know it's spring and easter bunnies all that's all well and good 

242.01 243.64 B: right yeah it 

244.77 251.37 B: it's nice if the weather's nice too [laughter] we have the spring weather but [laughter] it doesn't really work when there's like still 

246.74 248.86 A: well yeah [laughter] 

251.40 254.15 B: snowing out and the spring's that 

252.79 261.77 A: right well yeah well you know this this year it didn't do that it it actually got warm and stayed warm and that was nice but usually it's 

258.66 259.70 B: (( yeah nice )) 

261.69 274.80 A: you know you're thinking oh it's going to be nice the trees are starting to try to come out a little bit then all of a sudden you get this six six foot snow storm blowing through so [laughter] that kind of kills everything out but 

273.96 280.25 B: what do you think of like um halloween and holidays like that 

280.12 281.19 A: um 

282.76 289.59 A: halloween well i know with my family i try to make it's i think it i don't try to 

289.95 296.71 A: touch on more or less a horror theme or anything like that 'cause especially 'cause i do have a younger child and you know 

292.24 292.92 B: (( mhm )) 

297.41 303.09 A: for the older kids you know they like the harum scarum and all that you know [lipsmack] but for me 

303.10 306.68 A: i think i keep it on a theme of like a costume party 

306.53 307.43 B: mhm 

306.77 311.02 A: and i think in in my neighborhood we have a lot of little kids 

311.19 320.57 A: and so the parents go out with the kids they dress them up in not not scary costumes and but they go and it's a good way to meet your neighbors you know 

320.61 322.35 A: so um 

323.17 327.77 A: i th- i think of it more as like a costume party type theme i don't 

328.08 329.86 A: i don't uh 

330.13 337.16 A: address the horror part part of it like we use to when we were kids because that's just that's just too much you know 

333.93 334.82 B: yeah 

336.34 340.95 B: i think a lot of it's gotten out of hand whereas it 

339.51 340.90 A: mhm 

341.05 345.20 B: it can be a a cute holiday you know with the pumpkins and stuff but 

345.21 351.08 B: it's gotten it's gotten so it it's created much violence and people are 

350.65 352.11 A: (( mhm right )) 

351.09 352.75 B: i think some people think it's 

353.22 357.15 B: this bad holiday and and some people won't celebrate it you know 

356.45 360.06 A: right but y- yeah 'cause i it can be really sc- 

360.28 364.89 A: you know scary for the kids and they may not want to participate with 

364.24 367.09 B: (( then you got to worry 'bout the the violence too )) 

366.45 378.24 A: right you do you have to wo- uh you know 'cause and and worry about what people are doing like you know where i grew up there were people that would put tricks and stuff like needles and stuff in candy you got to watch that 

367.62 368.63 B: (( kids )) 

374.91 376.13 B: mhm 

378.18 382.57 A: you got to watch if anybody's doing anything in the neighborhood or like you know the 

382.71 391.44 A: peeping in the house throwing eggs on cars and rocks and things like that so you you know you got to think of the violence and the cruelty along with that and that's 

391.24 398.50 A: that's not a good idea and i'm thinking a lot of people realize that too especially once you get in young you get young children 

398.43 411.66 A: and they want to steer away from that i know a lot of my neighbors have just you know gotten away from a lot of that and they're trying to make it more of like a family orientated kind of get together kind of you know meet the 

411.63 416.35 A: you know make it fun for the kids but also make it a safe time 

416.42 423.77 A: and a good time to get to know your neighbors you know you know who's that person next door that you know you don't see very often it's a good way to get to know who they are 

424.02 424.91 A: so 

424.95 425.74 A: (( i )) 

426.31 434.61 A: as far as the violence yeah that's that's the big thing that scares me but i do think another holiday that's really cool good as far as getting together is thanksgiving 

434.32 439.50 B: oh yeah yeah and the turkey do you usually have turkey 

436.40 437.18 A: and i 

437.41 439.00 A: (( oh yeah )) 

439.13 444.18 A: oh [laughter] yes [laughter] we we invite a lot of friends over that um 

440.04 441.14 B: (( yeah ahem mhm )) 

443.60 444.83 B: mhm 

445.03 453.79 A: we that lot of times we'll have places to go and everybody in my opinion everybody should have a place to go for thanksgiving that's just a hard n' fast rule 

453.07 456.00 B: and macey's day parade [laughter] 

454.52 463.45 A: oh definitely definitely the parade and of course that's the time of year where the first christmas trees are coming out so you get to see those 

457.62 458.74 B: yeah 

462.11 464.03 B: right mm yeah 

463.51 465.13 A: and and the 

464.16 465.76 B: (( and the the the )) 

465.88 472.44 B: um celebrities like come in and they sing you know and you see 'em come down the parade and stuff 

471.90 473.78 A: mhm 

472.69 476.42 B: that's always nice it'd be nicer if i could actually be there but [laughter] 

475.73 478.48 A: yeah i know that's true that's true 

477.91 479.59 B: see it live but 

479.42 484.06 A: yeah that's true but it's really not another good holiday i haven't thought about is the fourth of july 

483.79 485.75 B: uh-huh the fireworks yeah 

484.41 486.69 A: 'cause i love fireworks 

486.41 487.51 B: yeah 

486.93 488.83 A: yeah i love fireworks 

489.44 496.87 A: but that's a good that's a good time of year too oh well i i think any holiday in the summer from memorial day all the way down to labor day is it's fine 

495.96 498.50 B: (( yeah th- )) 

497.17 498.93 A: summer time is just cool 

498.66 505.69 B: the fireworks would be better if they would well it depends sometimes you can go and there can be like really nice fireworks and they can be like 

505.79 514.88 B: like the last year we went to one and it was like the best fireworks ever they were like grand finale all the way through for like the whole hour but other times you go and they'll be like 

511.52 512.44 A: really 

512.70 513.84 A: wow
