33.41 35.07 A: (( you know [laughter] )) 

34.43 47.05 B: just a day to have a fun [laughter] kids run out and get candy and adults dress up and go out [laughter] in costumes [laughter] so yeah that's a good one [mn] my favorite one is christmas

42.64 44.35 A: yeah [laughter] 

46.95 48.28 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

47.64 61.26 B: um because uh that's when the family is sure to get together [laughter] you know and [noise] it's fun too you know you get to watch kids open their gifts and all that kind of stuff 

52.89 54.81 A: yeah [laughter] 

61.16 61.98 A: yeah 

61.65 67.83 B: it has a lot of meaning too um [laughter] of course [laughter] but ah 

64.02 66.29 A: yeah obviously [laughter] 

68.50 69.90 B: you know i think i- 

70.29 73.06 B: in addition uh to 

73.12 78.37 B: the religious aspects i think it brings the family so much closer 

78.94 82.94 B: you know when they when they um celebrate it so 

82.28 83.25 A: right 

83.64 86.36 B: if you could create one what would it be [sigh] 

86.00 92.57 A: i have no idea [laughter] i was thinking about that and i thought i don't know um 

87.78 89.14 B: [laughter] 

92.88 95.50 A: do you have any answers for that [laughter] [noise] 

94.71 98.02 B: [mn] not really um [mn] 

98.37 102.03 B: i don't know i i just want to celebrate uh 

102.39 105.84 B: something where everybody could get together and have fun and 

106.14 113.30 B: you know be peaceful [laughter] maybe world peace day or something [laughter] that would be good [laughter] 

107.69 109.10 A: yeah [laughter] 

110.08 112.12 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

112.49 113.95 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

113.32 118.45 B: and maybe to do it you could have um like international foods and 

118.82 120.60 B: dancers you know 

120.42 121.43 A: yeah 

121.49 126.25 A: [mn] yeah [laughter] i work at a university so they have stuff like that there 

121.63 124.67 B: something like that kinda that's kinda s- 

125.83 133.13 B: right right that's what gave me the ideas because i [mn] at one of the colleges i went to they had international 

126.76 128.34 A: you know international days 

131.57 132.13 A: (( [noise] )) 

133.15 134.00 B: (( ah )) 

134.27 140.03 B: [mn] international something day anyhow they had all the different flags and all the different foods and then 

136.03 136.85 A: yeah 

140.10 141.06 B: (( um )) 

141.42 144.35 B: [mn] uh native dress and all that and the dancers 

144.43 148.45 B: but you know what that would be kinda hard on an individual basis to do 

148.58 155.47 A: yeah well maybe not that much really you just need a [noise] cookbook and [laughter] um i guess i well i guess you couldn't do 

152.70 153.73 B: yeah 

154.33 157.67 B: maybe you know what it could be it could be heritage day 

157.95 159.27 A: (( [noise] oh yeah )) 

158.05 170.21 B: in other words a day that you celebrate your own heritage and you have you know you read stories from that or like for instance i'm part american indian [mn] okay and um 

168.83 169.90 A: (( [noise] )) 

170.69 173.45 B: you know make indian dishes and 

173.51 175.87 B: read stories to the kids about 

175.88 179.16 B: their heritage that way they could learn more about their heritage [noise] 

178.87 185.92 A: yeah yeah although that'd probably be hard for a lot of people because a lot of people are big mutts [laughter] you know 

184.25 188.59 B: [laughter] well i am too i'm a heinz fifty seven myself but 

186.20 187.08 A: right 

188.18 189.56 A: yeah [laughter] [noise] 

188.64 198.05 B: i'm like i'm one quarter indian and i'm one quarter yugoslavian and the other half is heinz fifty seven english irish dutch you know 

197.50 198.75 A: yeah 

198.02 206.82 B: [mn] but even if you have heritage day where they could celebrate you know one aspect of their heritage or even being american 

205.22 206.09 A: yeah 

206.66 207.74 A: yeah 

207.14 222.04 B: you know like have apple pie and [laughter] watch baseball well i don't wanna watch baseball but [laughter] you know something like that or discuss you know different things about the american heritage because that incorporates 

208.81 211.68 A: [laughter] 

213.54 216.14 A: (( yeah [laughter] [noise] )) 

221.70 223.77 A: [noise] yeah that's true 

221.85 232.63 B: all of it [mn] but maybe an american heritage day you know 'cause like independence day isn't really that [mn] memorial day isn't labor day isn't you know they're all 

228.69 229.75 A: right 

232.70 240.09 B: federal holidays you fly the flag but it's not really getting to the root of your own heritage 

239.70 241.17 A: right that's true 

240.91 243.90 B: so maybe that would be a good one [mn] 

243.27 248.43 A: yeah i have an irish grandmother so uh [noise] we we would always do big things ah 

247.93 250.79 B: (( on saint patrick's day right yeah [mn] )) 

248.89 249.88 A: yeah 

250.20 251.46 A: (( yeah [mn] [mn] )) 

251.60 260.74 B: so at least the irish have that [laughter] i think that probably was because there was so many that came over you know there was more irish than 

253.49 255.50 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

260.22 261.50 A: (( right [noise] )) 

260.87 264.94 B: american way back then in in new york and stuff [laughter] you know 

264.13 265.79 A: right yeah [noise] 

265.33 266.85 B: (( so ah )) 

267.10 269.86 B: that's probably why they [laughter] 

268.70 270.14 A: (( [laughter] probably )) 

269.88 274.13 B: they were able to do that and everybody wants to be irish on saint patrick's day [mn] 

273.49 275.91 A: oh yeah absolutely [laughter] 

274.17 281.06 B: and i i i do have a part that's irish but it's in that heinz fifty seven i don't really know how much of it 

278.97 279.95 A: yeah 

280.87 282.18 A: yeah 

281.54 282.50 B: (( um )) 

282.72 286.57 A: [mn] yeah supposedly i'm a direct descendent of pocahontas 

286.29 288.59 B: oh really that's interesting 

288.03 297.22 A: yeah [mn] so i i how true that is i i never know about these you know [laughter] these family trees that people make but supposedly uh 

293.00 294.53 B: [mn] right [laughter] 

297.42 304.60 A: you know i have an aunt who went back and through the entire family trees and found it so i don't know 

303.72 306.12 B: oh wow that's neat 

305.93 307.05 A: yeah 

306.39 309.80 B: whether it is or not it's still neat [laughter] 

308.05 312.14 A: yeah yeah right [laughter] it's a neat thing to believe anyway [laughter] 

310.80 316.15 B: yeah with mine i know my grandfather on my m- mother's side 

316.44 318.14 B: was um 

318.40 321.08 B: on the trail of tears so i know it's cherokee 

320.74 321.90 A: (( yeah [mn] [noise] )) 

321.47 331.41 B: okay and my older sister knows more about it but she hasn't told me you know i've tried to do some research on it and i haven't found it [mn] but um 

333.06 336.64 B: ah anyhow that's how i know that and then i 

336.65 342.93 B: i had a job where i traveled a lot and one of the places we went was on the cherokee reservation 

342.66 343.99 A: oh yeah 

343.34 350.53 B: and so i got the books that have the um the seven signs and the um 

350.69 354.35 B: [mn] the cherokee language it was almost extinct 

354.23 355.92 A: yeah yeah 

355.14 360.10 B: so i got the book of that the primer of it just little things you know 

359.79 360.89 A: yeah 

360.24 362.33 B: but it meant a lot of me so 

362.13 363.42 A: yeah 

363.57 367.58 B: [sigh] but anyhow for holidays that's a good idea i think [laughter] 

364.72 365.79 A: [laughter] 

366.77 371.41 A: yeah yeah th- that question reminded me do you do you ever watch seinfeld 

371.51 373.06 B: uh once in a while 

372.82 378.62 A: yeah there's an episode of that where george's father makes up their own holiday called festivus 

378.73 382.35 A: and that question [laughter] really reminded me of that episode 

380.36 383.07 B: [mn] oh [laughter] [laughter] 

382.86 384.15 A: [laughter] 

383.12 394.15 B: that's probably where they got it from [laughter] [mn] 'cause 'cause that's not something you normally think about if you could create a holiday 'cause there's so many holidays 

384.74 388.05 A: [laughter] yeah that's possible 

391.21 392.39 A: right 

393.76 395.62 A: right absolutely yeah 

394.83 402.43 B: you know that's why i like christmas 'cause it's kind of all together you know i mean thanksgiving is good too [mn] but 

402.55 407.01 B: christmas is more celebrated by more people in more ways 

406.52 407.97 A: (( [mn] [noise] right yeah )) 

407.31 410.74 B: so i think it's interesting to see 

410.72 411.66 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

410.78 415.70 B: you know how different people celebrate it some don't celebrate it that's true 

415.34 416.76 A: yeah that's true 

415.76 416.76 B: um 

417.08 425.77 B: but uh i think it's interesting and it it does bring the family together like if they can't make it for thanksgiving they'll be sure to make it for christmas you know 

425.29 426.28 A: right 

425.87 438.40 B: [laughter] i i have seven children and they're scattered all over the u._s. so [laughter] they're all grown with families of their own so [mn] ah it's hard for 'em to all get in one place at one time 

426.46 428.21 A: yeah [laughter] 

430.11 432.33 A: oh wow [laughter] yeah 

438.42 439.37 A: yeah 

438.53 446.92 B: so but this christmas i saw every one of 'em even though for christmas itself i went down to missouri for with my son [mn] 

445.77 447.23 A: oh what part of missouri 

447.18 449.76 B: uh near st louis wright city 

449.75 451.89 A: oh yeah i used to live in st louis 

451.53 452.77 B: [mn] oh did you 

452.52 453.82 A: yeah 

453.24 455.60 B: oh wow you weren't that far from him then 

455.67 459.92 B: i think he's what maybe fifty miles outside of it or something 

459.53 462.15 A: yeah yeah what town does he live in 

462.05 463.44 B: wright city 

463.61 465.02 A: [mn] oh yeah i've been there 

464.84 465.71 B: yeah 

465.81 474.27 A: yeah i lived in the city so [sigh] but i i've moved since [laughter] yeah i lived there for about seven years 

470.65 472.89 B: yeah since then [laughter] 

474.14 475.26 B: oh wow [mn] 

477.09 478.47 B: (( so um )) 

479.09 482.23 B: you say halloween's your favorite what's your second favorite [mn] 

482.40 494.09 A: [noise] um [mn] you know there are a lot of the little ones that i really like i'm for instance i'm really fond of arbor day [mn] um because you know it's a nice little holiday plant a tree [laughter] um 

491.74 496.02 B: right yeah it's a nice peaceful little thing and it does good 

495.43 502.94 A: yeah um labor day i think is a fantastic concept although i don't think we do it as we should probably [laughter] 

502.24 507.45 B: i agree i agree most people don't really understand what it's about 

503.22 505.02 A: yeah you know 

507.02 517.99 A: [noise] right you know just the idea that we should all take you know a day out in the year to think about what we do other than work you know [laughter] to realize that there's more to life than that [laughter] 

514.40 516.75 B: right reflect on it 

517.18 528.02 B: right nobody ever said they worked too much [laughter] or or no nobody ever said they didn't work enough right [laughter] i had that one wrong didn't i 

520.18 522.27 A: [laughter] 

523.40 525.59 A: didn't work enough i think [laughter] 

525.70 527.25 A: right [laughter] 

527.62 528.64 A: (( [laughter] )) 

528.20 529.37 B: [laughter] 

529.40 533.76 A: [mn] um although i've met a few people who probably could say that actually [laughter] 

532.64 537.16 B: [laughter] well the first one i know a lot did [laughter] 

535.27 537.29 A: (( [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

537.44 538.93 B: (( but um )) 

539.24 551.19 B: yeah that i like that too because it celebrates the workers themselves and gives them a break you know that's if the employers let them [laughter] 'cause not all of them let 'em off for that day 

545.99 546.96 A: yeah 

550.68 555.26 A: [noise] yeah i don't know how many places do but 

551.66 553.22 B: (( [mn] so [mn] )) 

554.99 566.40 B: i mean like you said they don't do it as they should many times and same with memorial day i mean i remember as a kid that [mn] these holidays were really done up good you know 

558.97 559.53 A: (( [noise] )) 

565.92 568.63 A: yeah yeah parades and [laughter] 

567.69 572.46 B: [mn] ah everywhere parades everywhere every city had a parade you know 

568.98 569.96 A: yeah 

571.48 572.36 A: mhm 

572.72 582.17 B: now they're few and far between you know i mean you find 'em but it's like pulling teeth you know [laughter] 

575.46 576.31 A: yeah 

580.17 584.48 A: yeah people just catch up on housework those days i think [laughter] 

582.93 594.65 B: right and they hibernate [mn] and the other thing is like fourth of july i remember the parades with that anybody with a bike or anything like that that wanted to be in the parade they could 

584.99 586.02 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

592.07 593.65 A: [noise] 

594.23 595.30 A: yeah 

594.77 599.89 B: you know and uh it was so much more every city had one for them
