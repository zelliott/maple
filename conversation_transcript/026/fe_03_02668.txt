140.48 143.21 B: it's very uh special for me 

142.89 144.03 A: right 

143.87 146.90 B: because christmas has no meaning without easter 

146.54 147.89 A: right 

147.45 154.22 B: [laughter] and it's not really easter it's resurrection it's e- easter is a pagan holiday 

153.88 163.02 A: well that's the thing all of the the holidays that are celebrated in our society i was going to say are are from pagan seasonal you know festivals and uh 

159.05 159.63 B: (( [noise] )) 

159.66 160.56 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

163.19 164.95 A: (( um i'm uh ))

173.33 182.22 A: set of beliefs uh and it what's bothers me very much that's why i kinda when i don't really have a favorite per se though i like to be around kids on christmas and 

175.07 176.03 B: yes 

181.71 182.67 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

182.46 186.22 A: easter um the commercialization is just outrageous and uh 

185.58 188.57 B: oh it is and it j- disgusts me 

186.84 196.59 A: and even even mothers' day coming up here has become more of a thing to sell flowers and candy and cards than it is to really honor mothers and grandmothers 

193.46 194.80 B: oh yeah 

195.59 197.06 B: absolutely 

197.20 207.51 B: and it [mn] all holidays seem to have become very worldly and paganistic and i don't um i don't subscribe to any of that i 

208.05 218.16 B: i take my personal stand against the commercialization by i don't send christmas cards um [laughter] i do buy gifts 

214.01 214.90 A: uh-huh 

215.92 217.08 A: i i i 

217.87 218.75 A: uh-huh 

218.65 226.24 B: and and celebrate but i don't [mn] buy into the commercialization i try not to go overboard in gift buying 

225.95 229.71 A: yeah i i really resent the commercialization a lot and and 

226.38 227.32 B: um 

228.88 230.65 B: oh i do i do 

230.25 242.37 A: both in years where i've had a l- a fair amount of money and where i've had literally no money i started some years ago as far as the christmas holiday i have several jewish friends who celebrate hanukkah of course 

242.17 249.10 A: and i'm not in a position to give their kids eight presents [laughter] and um i started some years ago 

242.19 243.54 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

245.35 247.76 B: exactly exactly 

249.34 259.34 A: um instead of sending presents because i do have a bunch of nieces and nephews and at this stage of the game my two oldest nieces have two kids each theirselves so that's uh 

259.66 269.09 A: it's just beyond the budget you know um so i started uh some years ago making donations to a favorite charity and that sort of thing 

261.05 262.77 B: [noise] [noise] of course 

267.50 269.85 B: [noise] and that's a wonderful thing to do 

269.53 279.73 A: [noise] and then having them send a card and uh i was tickled this last christmas 'cause my um my youngest or my sister's youngest daughter a niece who doesn't have kids but is married 

272.40 273.21 B: uh-huh 

279.86 293.64 A: um gave for me uh for christmas a contribution to the american uh society for for the prevention of cruelty to animals and i got this nice letter in the mail and it was such a nice surprise i went that's so much better than getting some trinket 

287.11 288.69 B: oh wonderful 

292.56 302.96 B: [noise] oh absolutely getting something that yeah getting something that you're gonna put in a closet and never look at again and having to pay shipping on it [laughter] 

293.71 295.88 A: sent across the country 

299.25 300.21 A: yeah 

301.55 311.39 A: well exactly that's what really killed me i always gave books or music and and sending even sending a c._d. is almost as expensive as buying a c._d. 

305.58 306.43 B: uh-huh 

309.75 312.72 B: as buying it [laughter] 

311.51 323.32 A: and you don't know that it won't get damaged and books books have become so expensive uh but the cost like you said of shipping is is really prohibitive so i've given in the past um this last year i 

313.66 314.72 B: right 

314.76 316.06 B: exactly 

319.12 320.79 B: (( [noise] uh-huh ))

327.69 329.29 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh wonderful )) 

328.57 332.23 A: did it in the names of you know my nieces and brothers and sisters and uh 

332.34 339.26 A: very close friends and i get as much pleasure out of that i mean i like to give more than receive anyway 

339.20 345.72 A: but i get as much pleasure as the whole i just i i don't go to malls i don't i just don't 

343.77 349.05 B: [noise] [noise] i stay away [laughter] 

345.66 356.24 A: i just won't go into them [laughter] and i think the last time i was in a mall is my watchband broke and to get it repaired the nearest jewelry store was in a mall and that's yeah 

355.46 359.66 B: i i only go to the mall when i absolutely have to have something 

359.23 360.36 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

359.76 367.10 B: and i can't get it any other way and i i buy online sometimes but i'm not real comfortable with that 

366.92 369.89 A: i i eschew that entirely too 

367.16 370.22 B: (( [noise] )) 

369.75 383.99 A: but the other holidays when when i was uh i was engaged for some years to be married and and the woman who i was to marry had a very large family and for several years there every ch- christmas and easter were of course big times for a big family
