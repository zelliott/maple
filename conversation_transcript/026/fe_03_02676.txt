96.29 97.24 A: uh-huh 

98.39 100.45 A: (( oh no )) 

99.65 112.29 B: so their kids would be thinking let's hurry up and get done and get these people outta here because we want to open our presents and of course we're all pouting because they get to open as soon [laughter] as we leave so 

109.70 111.06 A: right 

111.84 112.87 A: right 

112.91 126.87 B: but i've heard a lot of people i know my sister did did to um you know where they okay you can open one and it usually with her kids it was you know it was always the same gift from their grandmother which is a pair of pajamas you know 

126.27 127.42 A: mhm

130.56 131.23 B: (( [laughter] )) 

133.89 146.28 A: as far as like making a holiday i don't know what kind of holiday i would have i would definitely have it sometime like in march or april maybe even may [sigh] 

146.30 147.28 A: (( because )) 

147.05 153.09 A: i don't know i feel like the the end of the year has so many we have thanksgiving and christmas and then new years 

151.66 153.60 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

152.89 164.22 A: but then like the beginning and the middle they don't really have any holidays during then and like i don't know i just i'd like to h- share the wealth throughout the year [laughter] right exactly 

159.43 168.63 B: [noise] yeah and kind of spread it around and get get something some days off one thing i like that idea and the other one that um 

164.75 165.32 A: (( [mn] )) 

169.30 172.52 B: that i think is practical is 

172.41 177.27 B: i'm actually i grew up in northern minnesota right across the bord- border from canada 

177.09 178.04 A: uh-huh 

177.17 188.59 B: and they have boxing day just like um in england and canada i don't know what other countries do it but you know it's it's the day off after christmas

188.28 189.39 A: right 

188.46 194.21 B: so that you're not thinking during christmas jeez i have to go back to work tomorrow you know or or i 

192.14 193.16 A: right 

194.37 202.08 B: i just don't understand why [laughter] why we don't do it it makes so much sense but of course and that means it's you know 

196.98 197.84 A: uh-huh 

199.79 200.77 A: uh-huh 

202.11 206.51 B: favoring one religion over another and [mn] you know all that so

223.90 225.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

224.90 231.33 A: and there's a huge stretch of just like working time and then you get you get the break you get at the end of the year 

227.93 228.99 B: yeah 

230.92 232.04 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

231.44 232.84 A: (( yeah [noise] ))

237.20 238.79 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

239.14 252.38 B: not much you can do as far as work i guess i approach everything as in [mn] in my mind and as how much time do i have to take off from work or while i get to take off from work when i'm thinking about holidays
