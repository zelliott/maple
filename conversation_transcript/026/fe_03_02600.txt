3.97 6.17 A: i'm okay my name is sandy 

5.75 7.34 B: i'm ashleigh 

6.85 8.25 A: (( hi ashleigh )) 

7.82 9.55 B: hi nice to meet you 

8.31 9.11 A: we're 

9.12 10.99 A: it's very nice to talk to you 

11.00 13.37 A: so we're supposed to talk about iraq 

13.10 14.72 B: yeah 

14.10 16.27 A: so what should we start about 

15.71 17.82 B: oh boy [laughter] 

17.06 19.11 A: oh the list is long 

18.68 20.54 B: what a topic 

20.17 21.26 A: (( i know )) 

20.68 21.91 B: um 

22.31 36.99 B: uh disarming iraq well gee you know to be honest i really don't know both sides of th- of this argument um you know that uh what disarming will do versus what it won't do 

30.50 31.37 A: mm 

36.68 37.80 A: right 

37.18 40.24 B: do you have a uh an opinion on that 

39.64 43.20 A: well i i think that um 

44.08 56.85 A: that they're i think they're a dangerous country i don't think the people are dangerous i think the leader was dangerous and i think that arms in in responsible countries is a good thing but i don't think he was responsible 

46.58 47.63 B: yeah 

49.54 50.64 B: mhm 

56.82 58.34 B: yeah 

57.30 62.99 A: with uh using you know a lot of country have you have to have some type of weapons program for defense 

62.88 64.17 B: right 

63.67 70.96 A: just just for practical defense but i don't think he was using his weapons for the good of anybody 

69.12 73.74 B: right and not and not being up front about what he had 

72.02 78.98 A: yeah i think he was just i think he was just really keeping the weapons to um gain control and to use it as blackmail 

78.96 80.31 B: mhm 

79.63 92.85 A: really for the rest of the world and that's that's just not good so i'm glad they that they did that but now they're showing now you're seeing a lot of the weapons of mass destruction coming up and all the chemical weapons so it just goes to show they can lie through the whole thing 

88.82 90.00 B: yeah 

93.17 104.00 B: yeah well it's you know i mean disarming iraq would be would be a great thing to do since since they were supposed to be up front with the u._n. about what they had anyway 

103.36 104.66 A: [noise] but they weren't 

104.02 105.50 B: and they weren't 

104.82 106.11 A: right 

105.56 108.99 B: so you know it it's kind of a tough one 

107.64 110.48 A: if so many people were against it also 

110.19 111.41 B: yeah 

110.58 119.96 A: against disarming him and then now when they found out that you know now now that that you're hearing more and more about how what they're finding you're you don't [noise] see too many protesters 

120.13 121.27 B: right 

121.45 123.11 B: no um 

123.44 124.75 B: i guess 

124.86 132.70 B: it's it's kinda tough i i have always had problems with thinking of a of the u._s. as being a policing 

132.30 133.37 A: right 

132.72 146.05 B: you know kind of um parenting nation to the rest of the world which i don't think is healthy um in all venues but when it comes to weapons of mass destruction 

134.34 135.87 A: right right [noise] 

143.11 143.96 A: right 

145.34 156.93 A: but i think as a as a super power we have a responsibility to keep to not be like not really to be the big brother or to be the police but to keep 

149.67 151.04 B: mhm 

157.11 159.43 A: dictators like this under control 

158.99 160.31 B: mhm 

159.86 169.07 A: and understand that other countries also need their weapons program for their defense but but to keep keep someone like this from from becoming another hitler 

169.24 171.22 B: yeah [laughter] 

170.31 172.06 A: he was scary 

171.42 174.52 B: yeah really yeah really awful 

172.81 173.80 A: you know 

173.87 179.76 A: and now that you're seeing what he has and that there was connections with him and al qaeda and and 

179.83 181.13 B: yeah 

179.96 191.68 A: it's scary what he what he was doing while we were you know running around being happy and thinking nothing of what's going on he was doing all this stuff in the background so 

187.75 188.81 B: (( a- and )) 

191.03 198.11 B: right well you know and the fact that we also i guess supplied um a lot of these um 

191.93 192.80 A: i think 

198.14 199.41 B: (( [laughter] weapons )) 

198.38 200.52 A: mm right without realizing it 

199.90 206.98 B: yeah and um and now you know we wanna try and take 'em back and um i just 

200.70 201.58 A: yeah 

206.08 207.38 A: i don't know 

207.06 208.79 B: (( yeah )) 

207.81 209.58 A: it's a tough topic 

209.43 211.60 B: it is a tough topic y- 

210.72 214.24 A: because you know what it is our country doesn't tell us everything either 

214.02 215.16 B: no 

214.49 217.99 A: we don't know everything so a lot of it is a secret [noise] 

217.59 222.71 B: it's so true and you know i've talked to people who served in desert storm 

222.73 228.23 B: and um and other people who who follow this stuff very closely 

228.13 236.13 B: um over the years and and know about what's going on they still don't even really know even the people who are kind of 

233.95 235.15 A: right right 

235.91 250.63 B: in that knowledge circle and and have this other information at their at their fingertips [sigh] uh they don't they have their opinion on it but we're not gi- well you know the general public at large is certainly not given enough information 

249.38 254.85 A: [noise] right i don't think so but i i also think that they can't really give us a lot of information 

254.94 256.07 B: yeah 

255.41 258.66 A: there there there's only so much they can really give us 

257.86 259.36 B: yeah that's true 

258.92 267.08 A: but i feel i actually feel safer knowing that they did they did disarm that country i do feel a little better because i think that he did supply 

263.22 264.51 B: mhm 

267.09 272.28 A: um a lot of these terrorist organizations with weapons if he hasn't already 

272.79 277.02 A: [noise] with weapons of mass destruction with chemical weapons i'm sure he has already 

276.55 277.92 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

277.31 289.24 A: um and i guess the whole thing is to track them down and try to get the the weapons from them but i think i know i just feel a lot i feel a lot better that they did go in there i i feel terrible that so many people died because of it but 

289.77 292.93 A: um i just i just just do you feel a little safer 

293.70 297.42 A: i just feel a little bit better that they took care of this 

297.08 298.23 B: you do 

297.94 298.77 A: (( mhm i mean )) 

298.38 302.94 B: i'm not sure i i'm not sure it's changed for me i think 

302.13 304.62 A: (( i think there's gonna be a little backlash )) 

304.70 312.44 B: yeah i believe so i don't believe that this is going to be i don't i don't feel like for me personally that i'm gonna feel 

312.47 315.81 B: safer about this whole thing for a while 

314.50 315.35 A: right 

315.45 319.37 A: right well i live in new york so we had to deal with the september eleventh 

319.05 321.32 B: oh do you live in the city 

319.78 320.78 A: issue 

321.22 324.13 A: i live out on on on the island 

323.55 324.78 B: oh you do 

324.55 327.13 A: so my husband works in the city 

326.75 328.33 B: (( oh )) 

327.91 330.05 A: so that was a devastating day 

329.81 331.48 B: [sigh] yeah 

330.74 338.16 A: so to to see that they finally and and what's what's upset what's actually upsetting for me is it took them so long to do what they had to do 

338.46 353.40 B: [lipsmack] yeah well you know then there's also the debate of of whether or not it's disarming iraq versus you know i mean everyone's kind of lumping uh saddam in with osama um and sure that there are connections but um 

349.63 350.52 A: right 

352.48 354.46 A: they don't have any direct link though 

354.37 359.77 B: w- yeah yeah and so well who knows if if we're safe 

355.35 356.86 A: they don't know for sure 

358.55 363.10 A: but you know what i think too i think that if they talk about it then it really is true 

363.33 364.17 B: mm 

363.39 368.92 A: i think a lot of times they can't like you like i said you said we can't they can't really give us a lot of information 

368.95 370.45 A: but that when they 

370.48 374.45 A: talk about it a lot usually that's the truth that's what i find 

374.25 375.39 B: yeah 

374.97 377.56 A: [noise] that that's usually what's going on 

377.90 383.04 A: but no they haven't found a link yet but i don't do you think that he was involved with him i think he was 

382.56 393.82 B: oh yeah i i think that two people that powerful in in that in that space over there you know uh for sure had had some [sigh] 

383.39 384.96 A: i think i think 

394.17 396.52 B: you know some kind of um 

397.21 398.73 A: connection together 

397.48 400.27 B: work you know some kind of connection yeah 

399.48 402.48 A: now the big question is where are we going next 

401.85 404.31 B: [laughter] oh 

402.84 414.24 A: [laughter] you hear about well who else they're looking at now you know they're looking at iran they're looking at north korea you know are they gonna leave everybody else alone or are we gonna go after them too 

404.58 406.18 B: yeah 

410.54 411.68 B: syria 

413.85 416.36 B: i know i know and 

415.24 419.86 A: and is russia gonna start getting ticked off at us and they gonna start stepping in 

420.59 422.20 B: well you know and it's 

422.86 433.38 B: and it's not just us it's not just you know the the european nations or some of our a- allies that are that are kind of divided on this because even within our country people are saying 

431.10 431.85 A: right 

433.30 442.55 B: yes we should we should go and we should we should you know try and bring democracy and then other people are saying no that's not our business and and it's 

442.53 453.23 B: and that's even the case there you know um they they they are divided some of them are very happy that that our presence was there and and others are protesting so 

444.31 445.69 A: right right 

452.60 453.51 A: right 

453.39 454.97 B: you know i think 

455.02 456.49 B: [sigh] i i don't 

455.59 466.44 A: i think that once everything is all said and done and once once it everything comes to light as to what he was hiding and what was there and what the plans were i think everybody will feel 

466.78 470.47 A: um i don't know better but i think differently 

470.18 471.50 B: mhm 

470.80 477.90 A: about a lot of topics i don't think and i i don't i hope that our president and our administration wouldn't send us in there 

478.00 480.75 A: if they didn't have some solid proof 

481.31 482.69 B: yeah 

482.03 490.11 A: you know like i you know sometimes you wonder do they really know any is there really anything that they know or are they just going in there because they want the oil 

489.97 492.90 B: if right right and they're just you know 

492.20 494.14 A: or they want control of the region 

493.68 495.70 B: warmongers or something 

494.79 502.32 A: exactly and i hate to think that they're warmongers i don't want to you know that's i guess i just don't wanna believe that i just 

495.84 496.93 B: yeah which 

500.86 503.19 B: yeah well about our country 

502.82 504.03 A: exactly 

503.29 504.78 B: especially 

504.43 508.15 A: yeah i i just i just don't wanna believe that we're like that 

508.01 509.87 B: yeah no 

508.81 513.92 A: but yeah sometimes you wonder though you know they haven't really found anything substantial 

514.02 515.77 B: that they've told us about 

515.20 521.02 A: [noise] right unless like i said unless they're finding everything and then everything's gonna come out later in dribs and drabs 

516.08 517.29 B: yeah 

520.69 522.19 B: mhm 

521.49 524.17 A: which which might happen too so 

524.27 526.92 B: yeah as is so often the case 

527.00 528.08 B: people 

527.21 532.75 A: but i mean to be perfectly honest i started turning off the news because it was starting to get to me 

532.28 540.14 B: oh i did that ages ago you know uh when when all the war footage was coming over the airwaves and the and [sigh] 

539.95 550.59 B: it it just affected me so much you know i i found that i was so sensitive to what was going on in the world that it was really affecting me in my in my own life 

541.93 542.83 A: right 

549.89 551.30 A: right right 

550.91 552.25 B: that i i 

551.50 556.80 A: you're always afraid and well every time i saw a plane even to this day when i hear a plane fly low 

556.51 557.81 B: (( oh )) 

557.14 563.46 A: i i get my heart just sinks because i 'cause i think it was only thirty miles away from me 

563.34 564.58 B: (( oh )) 

563.73 573.50 A: that this had all happened and i remember sitting on the front steps just sitting there and i was just staring out 'cause i didn't know if my husband was okay and i couldn't get through to him and 

572.89 575.01 B: oh it was just 

573.76 578.58 A: oh it was just still over here it was still it was horrible 

575.11 576.78 B: it was just horrific 

578.20 579.49 B: yeah 

578.96 581.07 A: and to think that it was so close 

581.36 587.87 A: you know and sometimes he goes down there to run to bring reports to the fed and to think that he could've been down there 

587.46 589.76 B: yeah yeah 

588.26 591.40 A: it's just it's horrible what 

590.34 599.89 B: it it really is it's you know i i was thinking about it the other day you know and because for a long time i think that a lot of people had kind of put it out of their minds
