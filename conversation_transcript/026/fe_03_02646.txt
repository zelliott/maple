535.76 536.44 B: (( uh-hum ))

540.94 542.43 B: yeah 

541.73 548.28 A: [noise] so their their prices they they want to get rid of all their stock in the and and so they use 

545.89 546.81 B: (( yes like )) 

548.16 562.60 A: they use the holiday as a means of marketing the rest of what's left on their shelves [sigh] and it kinda it's kind of contorted because people [sigh] are trying to go out and buy their family gifts but um in actuality i mean 

551.46 552.63 B: uh-huh 

562.84 565.80 A: some corporations are using it to their advantage you know 

566.26 567.46 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

567.85 570.41 A: [sigh] and so the then the holiday 

570.74 573.88 A: becomes i guess i would say less genuine 

574.96 577.67 B: (( uh-hum yes i )) 

576.26 581.66 A: and that's why that's why i said as a young kid you're kind of shielded from all that 

581.55 582.50 B: (( guess that's )) 

582.52 586.88 A: as as a young person you don't see that and you kind of ah 

587.16 599.89 A: you just enjoy the holiday as as a a celebration and a time when you can be with your family and get lots of gifts and go round and play with new toys and [sigh] it's a fun time when you're a little kid you know 

595.68 596.80 B: (( [sigh] uh-hum ))
