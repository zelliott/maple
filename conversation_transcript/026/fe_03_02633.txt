7.42 8.99 A: yeah same here 

7.60 8.61 B: uh 

8.97 13.54 B: topic is um do we think that 

13.56 17.13 B: (( [noise] oh what was it ah the arms in iraq [noise] )) 

20.10 23.85 A: d- do we think that there should be 

20.16 21.09 B: hello 

24.02 28.19 A: in my in my opinion i do yes 

24.09 26.20 B: (( yeah i i think that you know )) 

29.03 30.08 A: do you 

30.34 34.34 B: i mean do you i guess i i missed the question i- is it 

34.59 38.24 B: should we disarm iraq is that is that w- what the question is 

38.00 42.90 A: i thought he said or she said ah ah do 

42.95 46.70 A: do about having arms in iraq 

47.25 49.27 B: our presence right 

48.61 50.90 A: yeah our presence uh-huh [mn] 

51.33 54.94 B: (( yeah i think we're done [noise] i think we need to get out of there [sigh] )) 

56.04 58.00 A: yeah [laughter] 

57.37 64.53 B: (( [laughter] i mean [laughter] no i i think i think it was good that we went over there but i don't think we needed 'em i don't think we )) 

64.88 67.81 B: i don't think we needed to do all that we've done 

68.24 69.38 A: (( you don't )) 

69.20 70.66 B: (( [sigh] no i i )) 

69.50 70.97 A: like like what [noise] 

71.08 74.80 B: i mean we have a we have an incredible government with 

75.27 82.25 B: with a lot of resources i don't think it would i don't think it should have taken as much as what it did to ah 

82.64 89.64 B: to resolve i mean they still haven't resolved it but to ah to come to this conclusion an- and yet they still haven't found any 

89.73 92.00 B: any nuclear warheads 

92.17 94.99 A: [noise] they still haven't found saddam either mm 

92.31 93.75 B: so 

95.43 106.30 B: right right so i guess my point is as far as our involvement over there i i i i think it was a good choice to 

106.09 111.51 B: be involved but not to this extent that we had to go to war and everything i mean 

111.83 116.03 B: we should've been able to find ah 

116.07 123.51 B: you know the information that we needed to prove that without going to war [noise] an- and obviously going to war still hasn't [sigh] 

123.82 126.17 B: (( you know conjured up the answer )) 

126.45 130.09 B: which in my opinion is it's it's ridiculous 

130.87 135.57 A: well i don't think there was any other way it could've been resolved though 

136.48 143.10 B: [noise] but we still haven't found anything you would think that somewhere in the middle of the war you know you'd would have a another 

141.22 145.51 A: well they've at least they've captured some of the terrorists 

145.54 147.01 A: that's a good thing 

146.95 151.76 B: that's a good thing yeah that's a good thing but 

147.96 148.91 A: (( yeah mm )) 

152.68 160.24 B: i'm not i'm not ah i'm not anti war but i'm just saying it's it's it's a good thing but the problem i feel 

160.52 174.05 B: is that if we were going to go to war or if we were going to go over there to take care of terrorists well that should've been the objective and there should've been a good reason for that we went over there to because 

174.82 182.30 B: there was no compliance with the with the situation of the ah of the mass destruction weapons 

182.37 192.12 B: and in the process we did we've eliminated terrorists but it's the whole idea that we went over there for a different purpose 

192.26 193.46 B: on pap- [noise] 

193.07 194.48 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

194.03 199.96 B: set out to be and i think that that's that's a problem and that the american people didn't 

200.30 202.46 B: i i don't think the american people 

203.00 204.16 B: you know 

204.44 214.98 B: honestly wanted it us to go over there to to just crack down on terrorism because iraq hasn't been a terroristic threat to us 

216.09 218.38 B: (( at all i mean )) 

218.45 222.01 B: bin laden that's a whole different sit- situation 

222.79 227.56 B: i i don't worry i'm i'm not i'm not for what's going on over there now 

227.26 230.88 A: do you have relatives and friends over there 

231.28 232.98 B: no i don't 

233.16 235.14 A: yo- nobody at all you know 

235.33 238.89 B: ah no um no nobody i know 

238.48 241.09 A: i don't either [sigh] no uh-hum 

241.44 252.14 B: so it's not a person- this is not a personal thing as a matter of fact you know i i come from a military background as far as family and all but i think it needs to be i think it's 

252.55 264.69 B: i don't know i think it's absolutely crucial that their purpose are at least laid out for the public so that i mean not without revealing what we're doing to the world 

265.52 271.76 B: i think it's important that that we have an understanding of what's going to happen or what we intend to do 

271.81 281.21 B: before we send that kind of money and that kind of fire power and manpower into a country all because 

281.97 284.21 B: all because there are you know 

284.30 288.29 B: we say that the these these weapons exist 

288.29 299.71 B: and we still haven't found them and that's pretty unconvincing to have spent as much money as we have and to have spent spend the time even though it has been short it's 

300.04 303.45 B: it's just rather unconvincing though if you ask me 

302.58 306.53 A: that was one good thing it was short only three weeks 

306.48 308.65 B: right and an 

307.25 308.24 A: (( uh-huh [sigh] )) 

309.15 313.69 B: (( and all the time i go into the theory and i don't think that's good either )) 

314.18 325.27 B: you know and then they may just have to keep looking for these things and they may not even exist but we if i i correct me if i'm mistaken but didn't we supply him with the original warheads i 

325.11 326.71 A: that i don't know uh-huh 

326.16 336.90 B: think so i can ah in the in the early eighties and seventies we actually sold we actually sold the nuclear weapons to 

337.17 343.61 B: iraq when they were on our side so of course they're there they're somewhere 

343.92 353.45 B: but you know i i i don't know i mean you would think they would've used them by now too if if they've got 

353.26 360.09 B: if they've got fire if they've fire power like that and if there's just one person there who's trigger 

360.29 363.44 B: happy you would think that someone would've used 

364.26 370.11 B: some of this ah stuff by now just to you know in in retaliation of what we've done 

369.74 372.91 A: well they have a lot of hiding places mm uh-hum 

372.13 383.01 B: but what i mean at this point at this point if they're terrorists right that's the way i look at it if they're terrorists and they have these weapons of mass destruction 

383.79 389.76 B: then even if they hide they'll still want i mean they're still they would still 

389.91 394.06 B: you would think they would still take at least one warhead or one 

394.92 404.02 B: [sigh] biochemical warfare agent and spread it and you know what it would all it would all make sense if for some reason we found out that the whole 

404.02 409.99 B: sars disease or whatever that that illness if we found out that's actually a 

409.85 422.06 B: man created you know biochemical you know virus if we found that out and we found out that its origin was from iraq then i can say yes it was all justified 

422.38 425.42 B: and that's the only thing that's been odd lately that 

425.31 426.65 B: that you know that 

426.64 441.01 B: that's really unexplainable i mean it comes from asia but that's the only thing that's been unexplainable as far as the war and everything actually if we get the troops out of there we have special ops we have navy seals they have we have the you know 

440.97 442.99 B: special ops from marines 

443.18 449.57 B: an- and get them in there and let them fight c._i._a. and s._i._a. have you know 

449.55 459.13 B: get those people in there an- and figure out what's going on find out where the stuff is th- you know we're not going to get hurt at this point we've got we've leveled the place 

459.94 464.75 B: at this point i think that they should if it's there and we can't find it then 

464.94 468.39 B: (( i think there are going to be a lot of countries that are going to be very upset at us [noise] )) 

468.78 471.43 A: uh-huh uh-hum yeah could be 

471.36 474.25 B: i mean i i'm glad you know i'm glad that you 

474.57 483.00 B: know i'm glad saddam's no longer in power but then again they haven't found him so really they haven't found him they can't prove that he's 

484.04 488.99 A: [noise] but the people the people seem to be happy he's out of power 

484.71 486.08 B: dead or alive [noise] 

489.46 491.21 A: that's a good thing uh-hum 

491.08 492.69 B: that's a good thing but 

493.31 497.67 B: i don't know if this is okay for the discussion but what about the oil i mean you 

497.98 502.23 B: know i mean now now israel wants the oil 

502.56 513.03 B: you know i mean it it looks very bad for u- in my opinion the united states has started doing what britain did hundreds and hundreds of years ago 

513.09 516.38 B: when we stuck our nose into a situation 

517.10 521.05 B: that sadly would've resolved itself i believe 

521.32 523.03 B: eventually 

522.32 525.08 A: uh-hum i i don't follow it real close 

525.09 526.02 B: (( no )) 

526.58 528.27 A: no not real close 

526.79 535.64 B: i i don't know i i can't comment to you but i mean you have you have a dictator because we goes and the same thing as fidel castro 

535.75 542.68 B: with optimum power and it really didn't work itself out too much but it it no longer became a threat 

542.91 547.70 B: we showed him what we had it be- it became militarized 

547.92 553.69 B: and i think it could've it could've been dealt with similar in a similar fashion 

554.18 557.30 B: now iraq is stuck with no 

557.70 572.19 B: well it's stuck with no government they have problems we're going to have to pay for that we're and russia and and us we're going to have emplo- we're going to have to install a government of some sort 

571.95 574.77 A: uh-hum uh-hum or the united nations is supposed to 

572.97 573.76 B: (( right )) 

575.33 576.42 A: (( he- help )) 

575.54 578.05 B: but they're not on board 

576.60 578.44 A: with part of that 

578.21 583.15 B: but they're not on board they weren't on board from the beginning it's just britain and the united states 

581.42 582.77 A: (( i know i know [sigh] )) 

586.12 587.96 B: (( i don't know i mean )) 

588.43 589.39 A: (( we- uh-huh )) 

588.54 591.59 B: i really don't know i mean i think as far as 

591.66 598.41 B: for the topic i mean they'd bet- they'd better find the weapons of mass destruction 

598.52 599.89 B: and they need to get
