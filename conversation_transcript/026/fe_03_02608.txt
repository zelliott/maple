0.22 1.44 B: hello 

1.23 3.26 A: hello my name's john 

3.07 4.96 B: hi john this is amy 

4.81 5.91 A: hi amy 

5.60 6.64 B: how are you 

6.29 7.97 A: all right how 'bout you 

7.74 9.20 B: fine thanks 

10.21 14.18 B: oh what the world should do about iraq huh [laughter] 

13.48 21.50 A: good right and it's asking should we disarm them uh it's a little dated because i think they uh put it together before the uh recent uh 

21.80 24.57 A: uh war that went on [laughter] so 

24.10 25.18 B: right 

25.98 31.30 B: i think um yeah other than disarming them this might seem 

32.20 34.90 B: bizarre maybe it is [laughter] a little bit but 

35.46 38.80 B: you know we're going over there and we're spending all this money and we're 

39.46 50.08 B: dropping bombs and feeding their people you know i think we have people here in new york city how 'bout dropping meal packages into the bowery or skid row or something like that you know 

50.34 51.27 B: um 

51.92 53.10 B: take it over 

53.49 57.75 B: you know how much money have we put into this land over there and 

57.78 59.89 B: how much money have we spent 

60.09 61.62 B: trying to make it 

61.72 69.07 B: somewhat of a democracy but the people there that's not what they know that's not what they understand 

69.65 72.44 B: i i think it's kinda crazy i think we could you know 

72.65 80.26 B: if we do like puerto rico or you know something that we've done like that make it a a u._n. a u._s. um 

80.35 82.15 B: i don't even know what it's called maybe 

82.34 84.80 B: colony or something like that [sigh] 

85.81 89.85 B: maybe we could uh benefit they they would certainly benefit 

89.97 91.35 B: from that 

91.85 93.76 B: i don't know what do you think [laughter] 

93.26 98.58 A: oh one of the interesting things that i uh have followed is for the last uh 

98.71 110.50 A: years ever since the g- first gulf war we've continued to bomb there and most of the u._s. populace has been unaware that we've been bombing the whole time [laughter] 

111.01 112.04 A: so 

112.12 117.59 A: it's very interesting because actually the news once in a while would carry it and they um 

118.00 121.55 A: uh it was just a few weeks before september eleventh 

121.72 129.70 A: was um one of the ones that i had noticed that they had carried a news report the u._s. had just stepped up the bombing again in iraq 

129.28 131.03 B: (( [noise] right )) 

129.94 136.08 A: and uh that was one reason i was not really surprised by the september eleventh attacks as we 

136.69 141.80 A: our government was continuing to bomb for you know a dozen years or so 

141.47 142.74 B: (( right [noise] )) 

143.03 145.73 B: well i think our government does a lot 

146.84 151.24 B: more maybe than we think that they do and um [sigh] 

149.70 150.31 A: (( [laughter] )) 

153.06 160.85 B: i don't know it's scary i know september eleventh scared the heck out of me i mean you know i live in new york state 

160.98 164.79 B: i have friends in new york city i had people down there um 

166.23 171.59 B: i don't know i mean that's that's one thing that like hit home to me but even before that 

171.93 173.73 B: i sit back and i think 

173.74 184.30 B: why do these people have to suffer you know let the rich get richer and the poor get poorer there's no middle class you hear people complaining all the time in america okay the middle class gets you know 

184.55 186.86 B: the raw end of the deal all the time 

187.29 195.57 B: but things like this you have to think do you really you know aren't you glad to have the middle class that's 

196.92 198.15 B: really 

198.35 200.54 B: something to think about sometimes 

200.83 206.52 A: yeah i think that's one of the things that's made our society a lot more stable is that we have not had 

206.81 216.27 A: the broad disparities yes we've had a lot of rich people and we've had poor people but overall uh we've had mobility that somebody you know 

216.37 226.09 A: just getting out of school is in the lowest twenty percent of income and then as they work they move up and when they retire often they're back down 

226.03 226.88 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

226.24 230.72 A: and you know people move back and forth so when we talk about uh 

231.11 233.01 A: income disparities 

233.40 239.30 A: it's a fluid thing people have the mobility here that in other cultures other other countries 

239.43 246.43 A: uh you don't have the mobility you're born in the lower class you stay in the lower class you're born rich you stay rich 

246.59 247.49 B: right 

247.05 250.61 A: that's been a real difference here i think um 

251.13 252.87 A: one of the things uh 

254.43 255.41 A: the 

256.20 261.14 A: uh formal reason giving given for going into iraq was to uh 

261.50 266.93 A: uh disarm them of certain weapons of mass destruction and all 

266.01 266.91 B: right 

266.94 273.42 A: you know they kept saying oh yeah we know you've got 'em government of iraq s- kept saying no we don't have 'em and kept saying 

271.77 272.80 B: right 

273.55 274.46 A: you know 

274.55 277.97 A: we our laws forbid them and such 

278.29 284.87 A: and even as the troops went in there and every once in a while they'd come across something and uh they were 

284.83 289.44 A: overly they were very cautious because they did not want people to be hurt 

289.22 290.07 B: right 

289.30 298.70 A: uh if they found something that was dangerous so they'd get a lot of false positives and that would get reported in the media and then later you'd hear no it really wasn't 

298.65 305.29 A: you know they like one of the latest ones was a barrel of stuff that they said oh this might be nerve gas or mustard gas or something 

304.86 305.76 B: right 

305.57 310.15 A: and uh especially there's missiles around it and as they 

310.27 314.21 A: did further testing it came out well it looks like maybe that was for 

314.26 316.33 A: refueling missiles [laughter] 

315.95 317.54 B: (( right right right right )) 

317.17 321.22 A: so uh they never did find the 

318.02 319.17 B: yeah [noise] 

321.66 325.33 A: any evidence yet of the whole 

325.38 327.88 A: rationale given for the war 

328.02 332.08 A: which uh to me is disturbing that our government 

332.63 336.75 A: went after this without that 

337.74 339.31 A: being 

339.14 344.25 A: you know without the rationale that was given being there yes there were other rationales 

344.09 355.59 A: but those weren't the ones used and you know yeah uh hussein was definitely uh very evil and had killed a lot of people but that wasn't the rationale given for the war 

356.67 360.80 B: right and and i agree with that in a way i mean i'm 

361.66 363.02 B: i'm pro 

364.50 366.09 B: iraqi war 

366.61 374.51 B: probably ninety nine percent i do believe however your point like i understand that that the rationale that was given 

374.92 382.41 B: you know they said okay it's like to disarm them of these weapons that may harm you know american citizens and blah blah blah 

382.70 384.39 B: but 

385.28 391.97 B: you know what th- these weapons of mass destruction that were not found okay that may not even be the point 

391.99 401.63 B: the point may be terrorist attacks in general like they did on september eleventh i mean that they did on the world trade center twelve years before that even 

401.88 405.29 B: and that is scary um 

405.31 407.95 B: i think maybe our government needs to 

409.16 414.83 B: they need to validate what they do of course because otherwise they wouldn't get any support or any money 

415.01 421.56 B: but you don't have to i don't think you really it's necessary to to specify correct me if i'm wrong 

421.47 431.63 B: that okay we're after saddam because uh he has these possible weapons of mass destruction all right maybe we're after him because we think he has a link to 

431.55 436.99 B: al qaeda that had a link to you know the world trade center bombings i mean that's where 

437.04 441.19 B: we wanna protect ourselves we we're too busy worrying about 

441.43 447.13 B: every other country in the world and we have people starving and suffering in our own country 

449.44 451.98 B: i think i think it's pretty crazy [laughter] 

451.45 463.27 A: [noise] yeah one of the uh ministries i work with is we we have a food bank and a clothing bank and such to help and uh try and provide what we can 

463.35 470.56 A: for people in need and actually [laughter] you know i've been out of work for two years so i qualify [laughter] as a client as well as a volunteer 

468.23 469.74 B: yeah right 

470.72 471.67 A: so 

471.33 474.09 B: yeah how many meal packets have you gotten [laughter] 

475.67 477.18 B: you know how many 

477.27 478.78 B: meal packets were 

478.82 482.60 B: like i said before dropped down in you know new york city how many 

483.66 485.85 B: people are being helped that need it 

485.88 488.51 B: within our own country i think that um 

489.46 501.05 B: we're too busy sticking our nose into everybody else's business and then when it comes to our own country we're not and it's not like these countries are gonna reciprocate i mean look at the 

501.52 505.79 B: years that we've put action into canada 

505.83 507.19 B: (( and um )) 

507.21 511.96 B: france and germany whatever and now they stick their nose up i 

512.02 513.84 B: mean i'm not saying that 

514.41 525.17 B: we need to have a world war three but it's gonna happen whether or not they you know either way if they agree to help us or they don't they're an enemy or 

525.51 531.03 B: they're an ally you know it's like you can't avoid it but why should we help you 

532.12 541.70 B: in a time where you're not gonna help us when we need it you know i think i think it's crazy and then we're the american citizens we're the ones who are suffering for it 

546.98 549.40 B: am i off base by saying that 

551.21 554.95 A: [noise] well i know there's certainly a lot of need and uh 

555.13 558.01 A: the u._s. has been one of the most generous 

558.08 561.78 A: countries both with our own people and overseas 

562.31 566.31 A: and uh a lot of times it hasn't been appreciated [laughter] either place but 

569.26 570.19 B: (( right well )) 

570.86 576.02 B: i think the whole oil thing is is an issue over there but [sigh] 

577.05 580.80 B: i think even if the you know america took over 

580.83 583.99 B: just say if they took over iraq and made it one of their 

584.72 589.60 B: you know sub areas or whatever like we have puerto rico and all that 

590.66 595.98 B: we're not gonna take those oil fields away from those people you know and and you have to think 

596.43 598.30 B: we're paying the highest 

598.49 599.89 B: gas prices that we've paid
