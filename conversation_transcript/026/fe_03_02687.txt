127.78 130.49 B: we're all christian christians 

129.92 130.69 A: mhm 

130.50 133.29 B: and we we look at the fact that this was 

133.30 145.91 B: the birth of christ it's a new beginning that's how we see it um and that's why we all try and come together to see what's happened to the family during that period and um 

144.32 145.35 A: okay 

145.39 150.67 A: just wondering how mu- how much of that is 'cause of the commercial aspect of it though like i mean 

150.68 157.43 A: in your in your house when you celebrate it how much of it is like the religious and how much of it is the uh 

154.60 155.24 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

157.43 159.66 B: the commercial toys gifts 

157.91 161.18 A: you know the santa claus and and all that 

160.65 165.96 B: it it used to be a big part it used to be i'd say seventy five percent when we were younger 

165.99 166.90 A: uh-huh 

166.20 168.48 B: but as we've grown older 

168.55 171.98 B: it more [mn] we we might spend 

172.25 177.83 B: a quarter of it on [noise] gift exchange the rest of it [noise] is just reflection 

178.24 191.03 B: and that's what's so beautiful about it it's because even though we're all in the same city a lot of us we don't see each other but maybe three or four times a year so that's our time to reflect in in 

178.70 179.56 A: okay 

185.00 185.75 A: mhm 

187.81 188.79 A: okay

197.94 198.82 A: okay 

199.62 200.56 A: i i 

202.27 207.95 A: i think the the nice part about christmas is that you get to participate in it like uh 

207.95 221.52 A: what i mean is that like you know on fourth of july or [mn] halloween or whatever you don't really get to participate but in christmas you get to participate in it like you have family over or you go to some other uh you know
