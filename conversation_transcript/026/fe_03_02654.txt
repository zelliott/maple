131.09 142.14 B: yeah i see i i can i can't even picture having christmas in the warm weather [sigh] and it's actually like one thing that's good about christmas is i personally hate the cold weather 

135.73 136.95 A: yeah 

142.14 143.25 A: oh do you 

142.23 152.92 B: [lipsmack] i hate winter yeah [sigh] so the good thing about when christmas falls [sigh] is that it's just getting so cold and like miserable but it's such a happy 

143.77 144.75 A: uh-huh 

151.10 154.12 A: oh [laughter] [laughter] it's a happy season 

152.94 154.80 B: it's such a happy time 

154.25 156.25 A: [laughter] that's true [laughter] 

155.37 162.61 B: so it falls [laughter] in such a perfect like perfect time but then when christmas is over then we just have to deal with like the winter 

160.92 169.76 A: um then you're down in the doldrums huh it's like when christmas is over it is pretty anti climatic [sigh] it's like the big let down 

163.00 164.04 B: yeah 

166.95 168.69 B: yeah exactly 

169.33 177.58 B: exactly like at least you have new years' so it lets you down slowly you still have something to look forward to but then after that january comes and it's just

175.54 178.31 A: (( boom [laughter] )) 

177.63 179.62 B: it's miserable [laughter] 

179.15 187.31 A: and january is really when you think about it is really one of the ugliest months of the year [laughter] i think anywhere in the country january's that way 

183.68 185.37 B: (( it really is )) 

187.20 188.21 B: yeah 

187.23 197.44 A: [sigh] i really do [sigh] but yeah i can see your point if you really hate the winter then it is a good thing that christmas comes in because it takes your mind off of it and it is beautiful it really is beautiful 

195.04 196.20 B: (( right it )) 

196.54 201.26 B: is and when it snows and th- the lights and everything it's so beautiful 

200.69 209.66 A: i've only seen pictures you know but i always imagined it and always wanted to to at least once ah have that whole thing with the 

202.70 203.95 B: yeah 

208.67 209.85 B: right 

209.50 217.71 A: with the snow and the snow fall and [sigh] to see the lights and everything with the ah reflecting on the snow i just think it would be absolutely beautiful 

217.08 218.44 B: yeah it is 

218.45 219.30 A: (( [cough] )) 

218.60 226.12 B: but that is definitely [noise] like the good parts [sigh] and being in new york it's really nice too just because the city's always so festive 

220.71 221.79 A: (( uh-hum )) 

225.62 227.03 A: oh yeah 

226.43 232.04 B: and that's what i love and i love when the stores are festive and like everyone's just so happy and like 

231.47 232.75 A: i know 

232.13 235.29 B: the music is just the best [laughter] and it's 

235.17 246.42 A: and don't you just wish it could be like that all the time i don't mean with the decorations and everything but it's funny what you said about everybody is so happy it's a shame that it's only that way for such a short time [noise] during the year 

237.34 238.36 B: yeah 

241.54 242.61 B: (( uh-hum )) 

244.91 246.09 B: i know 

246.54 247.53 B: i know 

246.57 248.82 A: [sigh] maybe that's the day we should create 

249.07 256.65 A: a let's everyone be happy day [laughter] for no particular reason [laughter] 

250.85 252.72 B: (( [laughter] )) 

253.21 255.43 B: that is that is a good holiday 

255.75 257.56 B: just a day of joy 

256.57 257.13 A: (( [noise] )) 

256.89 259.70 A: yeah which i suppose you could kinda 

257.92 260.13 B: a day of joy and family 

259.47 261.61 A: yeah i i which i guess has 

261.58 276.38 A: probably already been invented it's called thanksgiving [laughter] [laughter] [sigh] i don't know we could we could invent and celebrate our country day but that would be fourth of july [laughter] [laughter] 

264.38 265.64 B: (( right )) 

266.12 268.14 B: [laughter] [sigh] true 

272.85 277.67 B: (( right that's true [laughter] all all these are there already )) 

276.28 281.07 A: or we could honor our our president but that would be president's day 

280.44 281.71 B: right 

281.15 282.83 A: let's see um 

283.28 290.69 A: how how 'bout bill clinton's birthday i don't think that will ever be ah i don't think anybody will create that holiday that would be original 

286.84 287.82 B: (( [noise] [noise] [sigh] )) 

289.04 290.82 B: (( [laughter] oh that's for sure )) 

290.70 293.64 A: [laughter] 

291.56 295.59 B: that's true but i don't know how many people would want to celebrate it [laughter] 

294.51 301.48 A: [laughter] well it would give us an excuse for a day off [laughter] 

296.63 297.62 B: well 

298.76 303.00 B: that's true that's the best holidays are the ones that you get days off 

302.40 304.60 A: (( absolutely [laughter] )) 

303.38 310.19 B: so the holiday that i would create would definitely be a national holiday that yeah yeah a monday 

306.49 311.69 A: on a monday [laughter] [laughter] it's got to be a monday 

310.64 312.58 B: that everyone has off 

311.99 312.93 A: uh-huh 

312.70 318.49 B: and it's a national holiday because the religious holidays are a little fuzzy because not everyone celebrates 

317.72 319.54 A: exactly [noise] 

318.63 322.75 B: so it's always good when there's like thanksgiving so you always know to like you know 

322.76 333.89 B: wish somebody like a happy thanksgiving when around christmas you don't know who's feel like saying it's always happy holidays you have to say to everyone [laughter] because you don't know what holiday anyone's celebrating [laughter] 

325.01 329.57 A: [sigh] th that's true during christmas you don't you don't that's true you don't know what to say 

330.06 331.80 A: i know i know 

333.00 338.91 A: that's very true that's very true it could be a holiday called you know ah just for the heck of it holiday 

338.16 340.04 B: (( [laughter] )) 

339.00 349.19 A: that's what we should call it just for the heck of it day [noise] and it would always have to be on a monday or a friday i i'd settle for a friday [laughter] 

341.18 342.60 B: [laughter] yeah 

345.32 346.47 B: that's true 

346.54 349.64 B: yeah friday's are good too long weekends are always good 

349.22 356.85 A: [laughter] [sigh] and i guess it should be the time of the year when there are no other holidays you know anywhere nearby i wonder what month that would be 

353.41 354.55 B: right 

357.35 364.41 B: [lipsmack] august [laughter] actually no august is labor day [sigh] [sigh] or august september [sigh] that is labor day
