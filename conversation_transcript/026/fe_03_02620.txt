22.95 24.02 B: [laughter] 

24.42 26.37 A: so what was our topic for today 

25.98 30.27 B: um what should america do about iraq i believe 

30.21 31.39 A: um 

31.56 35.61 A: [lipsmack] i guess my uh my personal opinion is i'm i'm for the war 

35.44 37.75 B: mhm 

36.37 41.89 A: um i guess we went in for reasons of you know liberating their people 

41.74 43.06 B: right 

42.49 44.45 A: and so i guess 

44.53 45.46 A: um 

46.27 51.68 A: as far as disarming them i guess we should make sure that they don't have any nuclear weapons but 

51.25 53.04 B: mhm 

52.29 53.96 A: you know they they have to be 

54.06 56.58 A: left with weapons to defend themselves 

57.09 59.41 A: against somebody else 

58.77 60.30 B: right 

59.67 60.58 A: so 

61.03 62.22 A: how do you feel 

61.96 64.57 B: well i i agree i mean i i i 

64.62 70.40 B: mean i don't like war but i feel like it it's ne- it was necessary in this situation and 

70.71 80.05 B: i mean they're not there's no reasoning with um iraq to you know get around it so that's you pretty much what we had to do [sigh] 

80.25 81.29 A: right 

81.01 82.53 B: and um 

82.62 84.84 B: what let's see what was um 

85.97 90.09 B: part of [laughter] other part of our um question there i forget 

90.45 92.48 A: i guess is the disarming 

92.27 96.73 B: oh the disarming yeah um well yeah i would um say that 

96.77 102.03 B: we should make sure that they they don't have the you know nuclear weapons or the 

102.19 103.92 B: the power to you know 

104.58 107.46 B: get us [laughter] right 

105.52 114.11 A: get us i'm really i'm really disappointed with some of the the news coverage lately of of a lot of the people showing that they want us out 

113.79 114.94 B: mhm 

114.19 118.30 A: and and then they you know two weeks ago they were all happy that we were there and 

118.32 125.21 A: and you know i was happy and i thought gosh you know they really they really wanted to be liberated and they really wanted to be free and 

120.00 121.12 B: right 

124.81 126.26 B: right 

125.88 129.54 A: you know they were very very afraid of saddam and his regime and 

129.30 142.53 A: you know here we are and i felt like [laughter] you know way to go u._s. and now i'm just kinda like now they don't want us there and it's like [sigh] i don't know whether they're afraid that we're gonna take over or whether they're still really scared of the regime that's left 

142.59 145.32 B: yeah uh i i don't know either um 

145.48 147.59 B: maybe they're just um 

147.92 150.16 B: against our our 

150.28 154.27 B: way of life or our our ideas i don't know 

154.20 157.03 A: i think it goes back to a religion thing [noise] 

156.40 159.44 B: yeah religion is a big big part of 

159.86 161.87 B: that country i know that and 

162.09 164.94 B: maybe while they're over there they're trying to 

165.98 170.15 B: convert or i don't know what they're i mean i wouldn't think they would be but 

170.76 174.31 B: it's probably probably a lot to do with that 

173.61 174.59 A: mhm 

177.28 180.82 A: well i i'm kinda i'm glad that it's mostly over now 

180.40 182.68 B: yeah me too [laughter] 

181.93 185.07 A: i'm getting worried with with north korea though 

185.15 187.04 A: that makes me nervous 

186.41 187.63 B: yeah 

188.44 190.01 B: yeah i just um 

190.22 196.20 B: i'm glad it didn't come to the chemical warfare or the biological [sigh] 

197.08 198.25 A: right [mn] 

197.70 199.08 B: over here 

198.51 201.21 A: they they had made some comments on the news that 

201.35 204.78 A: if we never find biological weapons 

204.87 217.76 A: um would you feel like it was a waste and i and i you know i thought to myself i thought you know at first i would think that i thought it was but then i thought i still think that liberating their those people was the most important thing 

212.06 213.05 B: mhm 

217.58 218.64 B: right 

218.09 226.04 A: and i don't think that that was portrayed so much in the very beginning of the war i think it was portrayed more that we're going in to just get saddam 

225.72 226.97 B: right 

226.29 228.25 A: not so much free the people 

228.33 234.15 B: right yeah that's definitely what they've made the most um emphasis on 

230.73 231.29 A: (( [noise] )) 

234.13 235.12 A: mhm 

235.13 242.37 B: so a lot of you know a lot of people who were against it just don't really know the whole situation 

242.28 243.47 A: right 

242.86 244.87 B: i think but 

245.38 247.97 B: i mean they have other you know 

248.03 255.85 B: even if there's no biological weapons there's you know they have other means of um attacking us 

255.46 256.46 A: right 

256.12 256.70 B: (( [noise] )) 

256.86 258.03 B: and so 

258.34 269.09 A: i guess i never really thought there was much of a correlation between iraq and afghanistan until we really went over there i i don't know i guess i was just kind of oblivious to the whole thing 

268.69 270.66 B: yeah me too [laughter] 

269.89 280.26 A: never really thought much about the fact that saddam would have anything to do with osama bin laden but now now they're showing all these [noise] links and i was really surprised 

276.48 277.70 B: right 

280.02 282.48 B: yeah i know it's just [sigh] 

282.99 286.00 B: it's pretty much all a big mess over there [laughter] 

285.64 294.99 A: and you know i just i'm just surprised that a lot of it just goes back because the united states is mostly christianity based and all these things are over religion still 

292.01 293.24 B: (( [noise] right )) 

295.46 299.43 A: that just surprises me that that still is something that 

297.33 298.28 B: yeah 

299.47 300.95 A: the world fights over 

300.99 311.04 B: yeah well that's been going on since [noise] you know the beginning yep [laughter] religion and politics the whole you know 

304.44 305.49 A: day one 

306.13 307.48 A: mhm [sigh] 

311.73 313.50 A: the evolution of the world [laughter] 

313.11 317.52 B: yep [laughter] hasn't doesn't seem like it's evolved all that much [laughter] 

317.23 318.18 A: no 

317.71 321.42 B: [noise] not in that sort of situation 

321.57 326.25 A: now is this your first phone call or second or third from fisher or what 

325.75 327.50 B: it's the second 

326.86 330.25 A: this is your second i actually called in tonight because i 

327.99 328.82 B: yeah 

329.48 331.25 B: yeah i did too [laughter] 

330.33 334.03 A: i hadn't i hadn't gotten a phone call from them in a long time 

333.56 334.94 B: right that's 

334.28 336.77 A: i thought gosh you know i'm just gonna call in 

336.65 343.30 B: that's how yeah that's what i did too because of for the same reason and the last phone call i got we just talked you know for 

343.48 354.85 B: i think fifteen or more minutes and you know nobody ever broke in and said okay your time is up and you know do this or that so i wasn't even sure if that that call you know 

355.04 355.95 B: was a 

355.21 358.71 A: went through did you have did you end up receiving a check

370.83 381.51 A: phone call ten twelve minutes i can't remember and then the computer did break in and said you know say your goodbyes and and it just asked you to summarize afterwards 

373.26 374.32 B: mhm
