232.08 233.29 B: (( you don't [noise] )) 

233.05 240.08 A: no 'cause like i my parents are from chicago and i'm in l._a. and like travelling during the holiday is so stressful for me 

239.93 241.00 B: yeah 

240.09 243.97 A: that i'd rather see them like in february after it's all over you know 

243.94 245.70 B: and they don't get upset m- 

245.80 258.21 A: no i send them gifts and then like i call them and stuff but i they understand because i hate i hate going to the airport when there's like lines up you know outside and it's freezing i just don't like doing that 

258.52 265.85 B: yeah yeah that that's the well my my mom she would lay such a guilt trip because she thinks people should be together for holidays 

265.29 266.42 A: uh-huh
