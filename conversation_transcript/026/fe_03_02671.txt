314.89 315.89 B: yeah 

315.16 320.78 A: and then uh you know depending on the color you can make you can make like a purple mouth or something like 

322.20 323.62 B: that would be neat [mn] 

324.17 326.37 A: (( that you can add )) 

328.24 330.90 A: or like like knobby

339.89 342.06 A: and best friend's day 

341.65 343.12 B: yeah really 

343.97 347.91 A: now which one do you think should be first should it be me day or best friend's day 

349.04 350.54 B: (( mm i don't know )) 

351.16 361.70 A: thing is if it's me day and you make your favorite food then it's really easy for your best friend to know what your favorite food is a week later so i think best friend's day should be first 

356.57 357.13 B: (( [mn] )) 

361.78 368.10 A: so it's kind of like suspense for a week and then when you make your own favorite food or you get your own favorite food and then like your best friend 

368.14 372.26 A: your best friend either knows for next year [laughter] 

370.94 373.08 B: [laughter] 

372.51 384.87 A: and if yo- and if your tastes change in a year and your best friend um makes what your favorite food was last year then you'd be like uh-uh you have to catch up this is my new favorite food you 

380.24 381.16 B: uh-huh 

385.41 386.33 A: (( know )) 

386.16 388.31 B: [laughter] 

389.00 389.70 B: [mn] 

389.40 390.89 A: [noise] i used to like 

389.83 393.03 B: that would just be neat though to have a day for yourself 

393.21 394.29 A: (( uh-huh )) 

393.52 396.13 B: and a day for your best friend i mean 

396.46 398.01 B: (( those are good days )) 

396.59 402.57 A: yeah would you cel- would you celebrate me day alone or would you celebrate me day with everybody else 

402.87 404.40 B: with everybody else 

404.54 409.96 A: yeah th- that'd be that'd be kinda neat everybody else would be celebrating their me day 

411.07 417.13 A: it's like i guess me day is already like a birthday [laughter] we already have birthdays for me day [laughter] if 

417.91 420.57 B: yeah i guess it would be huh 

419.10 419.92 A: you 

420.32 431.11 A: but if you celebrated me day with everybody else like how how special would that be like everybody would be trying to focus on themselves i mean who who else would pay attention to you 

420.67 421.23 B: (( mm )) 

432.75 442.21 A: like the whole point of having a birthday is like you celebrate y- the fact you're here you're alive and then everybody else is focusing kind of on celebrating for you 

442.82 444.06 B: yeah 

443.54 445.67 A: (( yeah )) 

445.87 448.22 A: (( so i don't know about me day anymore )) 

447.91 449.31 B: [laughter] 

448.30 454.52 A: i think i think i think me day would be actually celebrat- you had to celebrate it by yourself 

454.76 460.23 A: and i think that would be great for like people who are uncomfortable [mn] being alone spending alone time 

458.50 459.70 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

460.39 461.20 A: (( you know )) 

462.71 468.53 A: yeah so definitely you celebrate by yourself so at the end of the week when you get back from your cruise 

468.61 473.23 A: then you just take the day off and do whatever whatever it is that you want to do 

471.27 472.36 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

474.69 475.87 A: (( hm ))
