37.93 39.09 B: (( [noise] you know [sigh] )) 

39.17 45.01 B: actually as i got older i don't care too much for holidays except when you get the day off of work and get paid for it 

44.70 49.06 A: [laughter] oh that's true that's true so [sigh] i mean i think 

46.88 47.76 B: (( [noise] )) 

49.06 58.98 A: [sigh] they're i mean i don't know there's so many things like in and in the fall and i mean in the winter time like definitely christmas and then new year's and then [sigh] 

58.81 64.50 A: easter i mean i know a lot of those have religious connotations but [sigh] 

63.74 65.06 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] uh-hum )) 

64.73 65.83 A: i mean 

65.87 72.03 A: i don't know i [sigh] they're [sigh] it's a strange topic t- to talk about [laughter] h- holidays i don't i mean 

70.76 74.46 B: all right i'll tell you wh- what my favorite holiday is the fourth of july 

74.54 75.76 A: why's that 

74.72 88.78 B: [mn] [noise] because you get everybody together everybody eating every occasion you know [sigh] happy [noise] and enjoying themselves [sigh] and i mean you know the fireworks and the displays and just stuff like that it's only it's something to do [sigh] and it's hot 

88.62 98.78 B: and you know what i mean usually [noise] now th- and then that's one of the holidays where really [sigh] unless you're having a big cook out it don't really cost you that much money 

91.00 91.99 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

98.58 100.29 A: that's true that's true 

99.59 108.68 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] you'll notice that all other holidays either you spend this [sigh] [noise] or you spend that and you get now you're trying to make up the money you done spent [sigh] 

108.48 119.81 B: [noise] like easter you buying more clothes and stuff [noise] to go to church [sigh] for the kids and all that stuff [sigh] christmas [noise] you know what i mean [noise] and and you know thanksgiving is a good holiday too 

112.23 113.32 A: (( that's true )) 

113.71 114.91 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

119.55 122.35 A: (( yeah i think it's like it's [noise] )) 

122.12 135.03 A: not the amount of money you spend on it it's like more the thought and then i mean it's nice to [sigh] you know obviously spend money and have gifts and like dress up and do things 'cause you're celebrating a special occasion [sigh] so 

133.42 135.71 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

134.82 147.58 A: i mean i don't know i mean i don't i think i guess my favorite holiday would probably be christmas 'cause it's like just exchanging of gifts and it's [sigh] a time to you know think about other people other than yourself and 

146.88 153.28 B: yeah but [noise] i think some most of the holidays are taken out of context now you know 

153.08 155.39 A: true true but like i think 

154.49 155.42 B: (( isn't it )) 

155.56 165.47 A: without them life would just be like [sigh] very monotonous if you go day by day and like like you said [sigh] like you get these days off of work and 

164.32 165.49 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

165.39 170.82 A: it's a you know it's a time for people to rest to enjoy and to sort of remember like 

170.34 171.76 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

170.60 183.98 A: [sigh] to set a day to sort of like oh well last year we did this and the year before we did that so otherwise if you don't have holidays then [sigh] you're just you're the same like constant like month by month there's nothing to look forward to [sigh] 

183.29 187.10 B: (( [noise] [noise] [lipsmack] uh-huh [noise] [mn] that's true [noise] [mn] mm [noise] )) 

184.28 185.28 A: so 

186.39 195.94 A: but um i'm trying to think what else yeah i mean i agree like thanksgiving it's like it's a great time just to remember certain events in our history and so forth 

193.17 193.87 B: [noise] 

195.34 207.24 B: right right right right [noise] [sigh] you know i i'm not you know taking anything away from holidays [noise] [sigh] you know that you get [noise] like it's it's somehow [noise] i don't know how old you are but i'm forty two 

200.78 201.73 A: yeah 

206.98 209.90 A: yeah okay i'm twenty six [laughter] 

207.31 208.11 B: [noise] 

208.55 213.59 B: (( [noise] right see and the and then there's certain things the way holidays used to be )) 

213.37 214.39 A: yeah 

213.72 217.58 B: (( right and just taking it you know i think we should stay with tradition )) 

217.48 218.50 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

217.82 228.41 B: [noise] you know what i mean because what they really represent you know [sigh] like you know you think easter and christmas you know you just think people just [sigh] it's all about the gimme that you know 

222.37 223.22 A: yeah 

228.01 228.92 A: yeah 

229.31 233.98 B: instead of the worship and why is this a holiday and all that type of stuff you know 

232.22 233.12 A: (( uh-hum )) 

233.65 234.69 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

234.08 247.71 B: and this is what we can't get too far away from because [mn] and then change one of you guys we've got to know how christmas is when you give this and that [sigh] and it's not because that's the day that jesus was born or you know what i mean oh you know you know what i 

244.82 245.77 A: true 

247.14 257.65 A: [noise] yeah and that's true but i think it like depends on the family and the people you're with like some families emphasize [sigh] certain things more than the others you know 

247.75 248.70 B: (( mean [noise] )) 

256.51 258.54 B: right 

257.50 266.91 A: like my family we don't celebrate like a traditional christmas we don't really exchange i mean we have a big dinner but it's not like [sigh] gifts are the number one priority like 

265.58 268.77 B: (( [noise] no right right right )) 

267.08 271.46 A: you know like i i still get gifts like small gifts for friends but like in 

270.76 271.74 B: uh-huh 

271.34 284.09 A: my immediate family we don't exchange gifts because it's like well we should [sigh] it's sort of like every day should be a celebration like we should if we want to get a gift for someone we should just get them we don't need to sort of wait for a reason 

277.77 278.86 B: (( [noise] right )) 

282.90 283.63 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

283.89 297.05 A: [sigh] it should be this excuse like it's christmas or you know it's your birthday [sigh] like if you saw something you really like and you think that person would enjoy it you should just still get that for them [sigh] and it should be like all you know like you should [sigh] 

284.03 285.26 B: right 

288.16 289.18 B: (( right )) 

297.05 299.31 A: the qualities of the holiday you should have sort of 

299.20 309.12 A: have with you all year long like being thankful not just like one day out of the year like well we should be thankful for all these things we have [sigh] and so forth 

309.02 319.73 A: i think that's where a lot of people lose sight 'cause they [sigh] you know it's like once a year or like you know once every couple of months you get together and you know and it's like [sigh] 

311.10 311.95 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

312.60 313.67 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

319.94 321.07 A: i don't know 

320.59 322.84 B: (( well it's just like a reunion you know )) 

322.22 323.92 A: oh sorry um 

323.11 324.47 B: (( it's [noise] [noise] )) 

324.26 325.76 A: i think it's [sigh] 

325.63 333.28 A: people should [noise] sort of like take every day as like a celebration not i mean sometimes i think about holidays and i'm just like it's 

328.92 330.10 B: (( [noise] right )) 

332.91 334.31 B: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

333.15 343.37 A: it's dumb because [sigh] we just pick a sort of random day and we sort of celebrate it each year but like shouldn't we take those qualities of being thankful being like [sigh] 

338.98 340.40 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

343.24 350.24 A: all these remembering things like things in our past like with us to carry it with us all the time 

350.08 356.97 B: [noise] right they said [noise] i think they want as to how if we didn't if we could create our own holiday what would we 

350.91 351.75 A: so 

356.98 359.04 B: [noise] what kind of holiday would you make [noise] 

358.97 362.16 A: um i don't know i mean [sigh] 

361.96 364.42 B: [noise] that should cause in a way [noise] 

363.47 366.74 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah [sigh] [noise] um )) 

367.44 373.26 A: i don't know i that's a tough one because as there are so many holidays already 

373.12 374.80 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] anti war day )) 

373.41 374.26 A: (( it's [sigh] )) 

375.02 376.37 A: what 

375.39 378.18 B: [noise] an- anti war day 

377.79 379.81 A: anti war yeah 

378.93 383.61 B: (( yeah some [noise] you know [noise] what else is going on )) 

380.96 381.92 A: yeah 

383.80 384.57 B: (( [cough] um )) 

384.58 391.36 B: [cough] by the week that we can stop and that we can make a difference and say to bush stop doing this and make a good holiday 

388.09 389.16 A: i know 

390.92 396.42 A: yeah or a a day of peace where people don't fight i mean 

396.45 400.39 B: yeah that's it there you go [sigh] ah national peace day 

400.04 409.55 A: exactly i think that would be an interesting concept [sigh] where a lot of people you know who are more pacifists they would agree with it um [sigh] [noise] 

403.12 404.50 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

409.89 412.55 B: (( yeah i mean no matter )) 

409.96 411.06 A: (( i don't know )) 

411.24 413.41 A: (( but it's also like yeah )) 

412.82 423.75 B: and no matter how bad you get that day [sigh] every peace day you've got to make peace with the p- person that you really don't like or something like that that day [sigh] [laughter] [noise] 

421.49 422.44 A: yeah 

422.58 434.27 A: exactly pe- and then peace within yourself and like [sigh] to stop violence and still like if there are wars and battles sort of like to make this not just a u._s. thing but like an international effort i don't know 

429.12 430.05 B: (( [noise] )) 

434.22 435.92 B: (( yeah uh-hum [noise] )) 

434.59 448.68 A: so [sigh] yeah so yeah i'm trying to think [sigh] but it seems like but it sort of i mean i don't know because shouldn't we want that for every day but i know we can't get it it's it's this idealized version of what we want 

448.12 458.10 B: [noise] [noise] that's true but [noise] people you know we we should you see that's that's the one thing about it i think you know on different levels and you 

457.19 458.50 A: (( uh-hum )) 

458.31 462.07 B: know the same people are just like nobody thinks alike [noise] an 

461.96 463.09 A: yeah 

462.58 468.78 B: and you know ah so sometimes it's hard to get people to come together and one thing you know 

468.22 469.42 A: that's true 

469.35 476.72 B: [noise] and even if you do get a whole bunch of people to come together there's always going to be that person [sigh] or those people who's going to be against it [sigh] 

476.65 477.96 A: yeah 

477.00 481.37 B: (( [noise] [noise] you know just like you have and you know who were )) 

479.97 481.08 A: yeah 

481.38 482.55 B: so 

482.30 483.52 A: that's true 

483.27 488.69 B: and now holidays whatever we do there's always going to be some kind of conflict you know [noise] 

487.68 500.25 A: i'm sure and disagreement and so forth and [sigh] yeah i mean it's i think it's difficult like to establish a holiday and to have other people believe in it and to pick a day that people would do this 

500.00 501.26 B: right 

500.99 510.15 A: it's like somehow history and like tragedy usually brings a reason you know like the death of someone usually establishes [sigh] a birthday 

507.18 508.23 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

509.11 513.47 B: [noise] that's just like ground zero day you know september eleventh 

512.50 518.78 A: [sigh] uh-hum exactly like that [sigh] so that push ourselves to remind ourselves of 

519.06 519.93 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

519.48 522.84 A: just like who we are people and so forth so 

521.27 533.88 B: [noise] right and you know that day did bring people ah that actually did bring um [noise] a lot of people together [noise] [noise] but it just seems like now that people [noise] just back to the way they used to be 

528.81 529.75 A: (( uh-hum )) 

533.74 534.95 A: yeah 

534.22 538.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] you know and and and stuff like that i think should are wake up calls [noise] )) 

538.41 541.17 A: yeah i think so too and it's just like 

541.33 543.45 A: our our actions 

543.23 543.88 B: (( [noise] )) 

544.18 553.25 A: and then we sort of suffer our own consequences what we believe what we believe in what we decide is right [sigh] and people may not agree with us and that's 

546.79 548.15 B: exactly 

553.31 559.82 A: you know just part of us human beings and constantly in conflict [sigh] so 

553.72 555.08 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

558.12 561.72 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] so you're a student right [noise] 

561.31 563.91 A: oh i'm actually working so 

563.69 565.40 B: (( [noise] oh you work in a restaurant ))
