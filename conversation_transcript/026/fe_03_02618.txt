12.48 15.60 A: i'm in um san diego california 

15.44 17.84 B: okay i'm in washington d._c. 

17.50 29.32 A: oh well about as far apart as we could get huh well let's see how far apart we are [laughter] with our viewpoints i guess we're supposed to be talking about um the disarming of iraq 

19.70 20.82 B: (( uh-huh )) 

22.39 24.00 B: [laughter] 

29.31 36.06 B: yeah i don't know um if if that's a little dated or not i mean i feel [laughter] like um 

34.89 36.08 A: [laughter] 

36.09 46.11 B: you know i mean i'm not as informed as i probably could be um at the stage that we are um with iraq right now but i feel like 

40.78 41.89 A: mhm 

42.78 43.95 A: mhm 

46.05 56.96 B: um i mean the u._s. has already done what it what it intended on doing um which is currently disarming iraq correct 

56.09 62.17 A: uh correct but i understand that they're still looking for the um weapons of mass destruction 

61.84 68.44 B: right and you know i mean i've i've never been a big proponent of the war [laughter] um 

67.52 69.03 A: [laughter] 

68.40 76.54 B: and i i feel like there definitely were were ways to go about doing things that were legal and um diplomatic 

76.37 84.75 B: i also understand that you know sometimes um those don't work as well but i don't feel like we um exhausted those methods um 

83.98 86.06 A: mm mhm 

84.82 96.00 B: and i and i don't think that the reason why we went about it so soon was i think i i don't feel like we were in the immediate danger that um the bush administration and the media sort of [sigh] 

96.27 97.90 B: i guess tried to get 

97.96 102.21 B: people to um believe you know to agree with their cause 

101.16 107.81 A: uh-huh yeah well you know it's it's interesting i used to consider myself 

108.42 110.24 A: what they called a dove 

110.13 111.47 B: uh-huh 

110.67 112.70 A: and do you know what that is 

112.49 115.45 B: uh well i can assume um [laughter] 

114.91 121.48 A: uh very peacefully oriented and and that war is an abomination under any circumstances 

115.57 117.81 B: [mn] r- right 

120.82 121.78 B: uh-huh 

121.64 127.78 A: and strangely enough i've changed over the years i'm not quite sure why 

127.69 128.69 B: mhm 

128.07 134.58 A: but i really do believe that iraq and i wasn't a big fan of bush by the way 

134.38 135.55 B: right 

134.68 145.39 A: um but i um i do believe that iraq has weapons of mass destruction i believe that there's a lot of middle eastern countries with weapons of mass destruction 

143.27 144.24 B: mhm 

145.57 159.05 A: and i went against some of my friends who don't believe that and even though we don't talk about it a lot i believe that it's kind of affected our friendships because i believe that we did the right thing 

156.85 157.83 B: right 

159.75 168.12 B: well i mean i feel like the first thing that we should've done about saddam is to not support him fully right through his worst atrocities 

167.93 175.00 B: you know and far beyond and to not have provided him with the means to develop weapons of mass destruction in the first place [laughter] um 

173.72 177.11 A: you know i i agree with that um 

176.03 177.22 B: mhm 

177.15 188.17 A: i have to say that i'm not fully my ex husband is a marine corps reserve and has um a history with the marine corps was you know an officer with the marine corps 

182.88 184.15 B: mhm 

188.02 200.21 A: and has been called back up for fulltime duty and like i say he is my ex so we don't believe you know we don't [laughter] we don't believe all the same things um however 

188.22 189.61 B: mhm 

191.36 192.41 B: right 

194.92 195.98 B: [laughter] 

196.09 197.40 B: right 

198.39 199.64 B: right 

200.19 210.12 A: i don't really remember the history of it with the or- original bush but apparently it was one of those things where it was um 

210.62 211.66 A: um 

213.24 216.92 A: [sigh] how can i say this they 

217.39 218.99 A: they supported 

218.96 232.61 A: saddam hussein as the lesser of two evils and um that's how he ended up being supported by us and i don't i don't really know i mean i don't trust the government entirely either i mean um 

221.89 223.09 B: mhm 

231.80 232.79 B: (( right mhm )) 

232.69 234.51 A: i i don't know 

234.77 239.36 A: exactly why they supported him but they did and um 

239.75 245.82 A: i i personally am behind it all the way i mean i think they did the right thing 

245.84 249.35 A: i i've read a lot of history about germany 

249.26 250.32 B: mhm 

249.46 252.40 A: and uh i know that there was a time 

252.74 254.39 A: when you know 

254.87 268.65 A: the the destruction of hitler wasn't taken seriously you know they wanted to wait and see what was going to happen and now people take a lot of grief because oh well you didn't jump in it faster you know where's your humanitarian beliefs 

261.67 262.95 B: right 

268.56 269.73 B: right 

268.71 276.08 A: and i think if we didn't jump in and take care of saddam hussein we're going to face the same thing in the future 

275.97 288.98 B: well i mean i agree i i'm not always opposed to war i mean i would obviously prefer peace uh you know to war but i don't think that everything can always be solved peacefully and i think in some cases 

288.94 293.17 B: things have to be solved through force just like with hitler i mean there's 

290.95 292.17 A: right 

293.22 306.56 B: sometimes just no way around it but i mean i i do feel like the government supports um dictators in third world countries um far often than than we know i mean there's you know 

295.03 296.33 A: right 

305.66 307.39 A: i think you're probably right 

307.37 310.32 B: um just like um [lipsmack] 

310.40 314.35 B: in burma i mean the president right now who um 

314.24 328.18 B: the the president who the people of burma elected the government has put under house arrest or our government has put under house arrest um and installed um a military leader which most people don't even know about but it's like the situation 

326.70 328.95 A: i've never heard anything about that 

328.86 334.06 B: yeah i mean the situation going on at the moment right there is also you know is is very very bad 

333.89 343.92 B: but i feel like right now our interest is in ir- is in the middle east for countless different reasons and it's i definitely agree that it's it's really good for the people of iraq and i think that 

344.04 356.70 B: if that was our sole you know interest in mind then i think we would be very noble and that would [laughter] would be a good thing i just i i guess i'm a little skeptical as to why we always you know i feel like sometimes 

356.72 366.00 B: we support things when it is in our interest and i just have to wonder you know what it what could be our other interest aside from disarming saddam 

365.67 366.64 A: uh-huh 

365.90 374.18 B: and i you know it might be naive to think that it's just oil but i think that that probably does have a large part to do with you know 

373.24 377.66 A: really and i feel just the opposite i don't think it has anything to do with the oil at all 

377.64 381.62 B: right [laughter] yeah 

378.32 384.41 A: yeah [laughter] you know i have i live in a part of southern california that has 

384.51 390.38 A: an extremely high uh concentration of caldians do you know what that is 

390.53 391.82 B: no i don't 

391.45 395.37 A: uh caldians are christian um 

395.57 398.19 A: christian iraqis 

397.77 398.76 B: uh-huh 

398.57 404.86 A: and so of course they've faced a lot of persecution when they were living in iraq because they weren't muslim 

404.92 406.00 B: mhm 

405.23 408.75 A: and um i live in a subdivision that 

408.90 418.22 A: oh let's see there's fifty two houses probably mm twenty of them are are inhabited by caldians 

417.98 418.95 B: (( mhm )) 

418.33 420.01 A: and um 

420.48 426.87 A: i don't know of anybody in our neighborhood who hasn't entirely supported the overthrow of the iraqi government 

426.41 427.59 B: right 

427.05 432.15 A: because you know they have family there some of them have family who've been tortured 

432.18 440.57 A: and it's their belief that um saddam hussein has had um weapons that he's had a lot of time to 

440.71 441.91 A: hide 

442.03 443.27 B: right 

442.58 444.37 A: because apparently 

444.49 451.30 A: um that part of the country iraq is approximately the size of california is what i've heard i don't know if that's true 

450.62 451.82 B: right 

451.90 457.97 B: uh to be honest i'm not sure exactly i mean i you mean population wise or uh 

456.22 458.86 A: um uh geographical 

458.69 462.12 B: oh i'm i'm really not pos- i'm not sure on that 

461.17 466.96 A: yeah so there's a lot of area a lot of desert you know where they could be hiding this sort of thing 

462.95 463.93 B: right 

464.15 465.32 B: right 

466.62 467.86 B: well i mean i 

468.17 477.33 B: i mean i think it's hard to tell you know just based on and i don't have those you know specific um [lipsmack] you know real life examples 

473.97 474.95 A: uh-huh 

477.99 479.41 B: is my big 

479.37 492.83 B: source and i and i think that there's probably a lot more i'm sure a lot of people are very happy but based on even what you know i feel like the biased media [laughter] presents there's still definitely i think a lot of people who still aren't happy with our role 

488.18 489.58 A: [laughter] 

492.73 499.30 B: and i don't think that we should entirely discredit them for being ungrateful because i know 

499.28 506.40 B: historically we still have done a lot you know of damage i mean they've they are just a country devastated by war 

506.31 515.53 B: and i think that if we're going to install a democratic government there that we have to be willing to accept that in a democracy people might not actually like us you know 

514.89 516.53 A: [laughter] 

515.52 527.77 B: and um i think that um while it's definitely good and i don't think saddam hussein is you know i think he's a very very bad person and i think it was definitely [sigh] it was right to get him out of power i 

527.77 535.89 B: i don't know if there could have been a better way i mean it's i'm i am happy with the war that the war turned out the fact that it was as quick as it was 

535.37 536.53 A: mhm 

535.90 545.99 B: uh but i still feel like there's probably going to be a lot of opposition i and i still think after the war i mean dick cheney is a businessman who profited off of the first war 

545.60 546.67 A: mhm 

545.87 552.39 B: you know so i mean even though i know that you know the people of iraq are very happy i'm sure a lot of people are and 

552.25 553.13 B: um 

552.99 565.56 B: possibly we could have prevented a a lot of future damage i mean there's still going to be the threat of a lot of people being unhappy and a lot of those people you know could turn out to be [laughter] potential terrorists and you know i don't think it's going to 

565.41 569.47 B: maybe in the end save us from as much um harm as 

567.39 568.36 A: mhm 

569.43 572.59 A: so are you thinking that by um 

569.49 570.96 B: as we could anticipate 

572.89 578.76 A: by going into iraq we've opened ourselves to the possibilities of terrorism more terrorism 

578.72 592.50 B: well i don't if it would have been prevented either way i mean i think um i certainly don't think that it helped things um i mean i if anything i think it it could fuel you know more anger and and and 

581.72 583.20 A: yeah i don't either 

583.30 584.15 A: (( yeah )) 

592.52 597.27 B: could have possibly made it worse i don't think that it would've been better by not going in 

596.96 597.94 A: mhm 

597.29 599.89 B: um i just you know i i feel
