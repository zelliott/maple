0.15 1.79 A: hi i'm candy 

1.41 3.24 B: i'm crystal [noise] 

3.15 4.10 A: how are you 

4.02 5.49 B: good and how are you 

5.33 9.60 A: pretty good i i forgot about the phone calls and i was almost asleep [laughter] 

9.66 12.09 B: oh i hate when they do that 

11.94 17.41 A: yeah [laughter] so ah what do you think we should do about iraq 

17.24 26.80 B: well i'm said this from the beginning that if bush would've said [sigh] the correct thing we would've been totally in support of of iraq 

26.67 27.50 A: uh-huh 

26.93 30.41 B: he should've said to we are to go to war 

30.49 36.89 B: to free the iraqi people from their dictator which would've been saddam 

36.97 37.81 A: uh-huh 

37.23 46.28 B: instead he's like well we'll just throw saddam out of power so i support what i support our troops but i don't support support bush 

46.46 47.54 A: i agree 

47.57 48.66 B: because 

48.05 49.29 A: definitely agree 

49.22 60.00 B: you know he for one thing if clinton was in office we'd be doing something totally different [sigh] this wasn't the really big worrisome until bush got into power into the 

54.72 55.78 A: yeah 

60.11 62.17 B: presidency 

61.94 63.67 A: yeah 

64.00 66.31 B: [noise] but it's like [noise] 

67.82 69.59 B: it's really hard to 

70.38 74.17 B: say what would've been right or would've be- what would've been wrong 

74.94 83.10 B: with everything but we should never have put our troops in the first place out there because we've already had so many deaths from this war already 

83.13 84.77 A: yeah we definitely have 

83.99 88.53 B: and they should've nev- we should've never have had those deaths 

92.63 95.61 B: [noise] so what do you think also 

96.44 99.53 A: almost exactly the same thing i don't really 

98.35 98.98 B: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

99.94 106.58 A: i mean i agree with the reason we're over there but i don't agree with his tactics on how he went about it 

106.20 107.32 B: yeah 

107.60 110.19 B: because the u._n. would've supported us 

110.51 111.12 A: yeah 

111.02 113.40 B: if he would've said it correctly 

113.40 114.66 A: oh definitely 

115.76 121.38 A: i mean i've got a family that's over there now and i just pray to god they come home 

121.26 123.24 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

123.48 132.97 B: [mn] and it's just like what um that one guy said when his ah son was killed [mn] that he puts all the blame on bush 

133.26 134.94 A: yeah 

134.20 137.23 B: [noise] because if it wasn't for bush 

137.26 143.09 B: most of our soldiers that have died would not have died they would've been at home safe with their families 

142.87 143.94 A: (( mm definitely )) 

143.80 146.27 B: and now they're so many people 

146.38 153.06 B: in our country that are going without a mom or a dad [sigh] or a sibling 

153.77 157.05 B: you know and it just it wasn't worth it 

155.95 158.19 A: no it's definitely not worth it 

158.64 165.71 B: and [laughter] most of the accidents were mainly because of [sigh] we flying into a briton plane or 

166.11 167.59 B: something stupid 

167.70 168.83 A: yeah 

168.47 173.24 B: instead of ex- except for when we got bombarded and had our 

173.52 175.95 B: [sigh] um people taken over 

177.38 181.12 B: you know and they were captive and pows so it was like 

181.67 188.05 B: why are we going through this it's not worth it on our country [noise] we've already had enough damage to it 

187.95 190.81 A: yeah we definitely have it definitely had that 

190.76 195.80 B: [noise] [mn] and the person that we should be more worried about is bin laden not saddam 

197.36 203.34 A: mm i think it's kinda equal but for me if we would've took care of saddam the first time we were over there 

197.51 198.33 B: (( 'cause he's )) 

203.12 204.45 B: yeah 

204.14 205.76 A: we wouldn't be over there now 

205.74 207.87 B: yeah we should've taken him like 

206.99 211.14 A: what really ticks us ticks me off most is we really had him last time 

211.35 212.73 A: and we let him go 

212.51 215.29 B: [noise] yep we would've 

214.49 220.56 A: just so we could turn round and cost more tax dollars and grief to go back over there for a unsupported war 

220.94 223.21 A: i mean [sigh] that's just crazy 

222.78 226.15 B: yeah it's hurt our economy too totally 

225.56 226.59 A: oh yeah mm 

226.59 240.91 B: and we we should've went over there when we had when we were over there ten plus years ago [sigh] is when we should've just got done with it [noise] instead we had to wait this long to take him out of power 

235.59 237.35 A: (( and )) 

241.21 243.74 A: then we lost that many lives last time 

243.77 248.57 B: [noise] uh-hum and because of bush we have no funding for our schools because we went to war instead 

244.41 245.49 A: (( because )) 

248.71 251.78 B: and a lot of our schools are closing down because of it 

248.74 249.91 A: oh yeah 

251.37 254.72 A: oh yeah definitely it's hit here pretty hard here too 

252.54 254.40 B: [noise] because they [noise] 

254.96 259.33 B: oh it was like he took um a tax cut of like 

259.61 266.23 B: mean out of for schools it was like forty forty nine million i think more 

264.97 266.24 A: yeah 

267.19 268.66 B: i mean our s- 

267.85 272.12 A: i've been signing petitions against it but our word don't mean nothing [laughter] i don't think 

272.30 280.75 B: [sigh] i c- called our senator and stuff like that and um it's like [noise] and our representative and stuff because right now our um 

280.67 288.04 B: our governor is going into a special meeting [sigh] because of the war and everything and re-pass trying to pass things 

288.22 289.51 B: so we can get 

289.63 292.22 B: money for our schools and stuff 

292.12 293.43 A: well that's good 

293.60 301.13 B: [noise] well it's like we're not the ones in ten in less than ten years we're not going to be the ones that are running our country it's our children 

301.08 305.89 A: yeah and if they don't have an education where do we stand i 

301.56 304.95 B: just like our family before that 

305.19 306.30 B: (( uh-hum )) 

307.02 310.70 A: mean my kids are five seven and eight and 

310.83 314.04 A: the way things are right now i kind of wish i'd never had 'em 

314.14 315.97 B: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

315.27 318.21 A: i hate them growing up in a world that's so screwed up 

318.42 320.73 B: [noise] i have a two year old 

320.81 333.92 B: and i'm to to the point that i believe that i think other than [sigh] there's one good school where i live at and i'm thinking about sending her there [sigh] but other than that i would home school her 

334.56 335.38 A: (( yeah )) 

334.99 341.97 B: because of everything that goes on at school and stuff now we have to worry about people coming in with guns and stuff 

341.69 345.51 A: i know i don't i don't know what in the world's happened somewhere another 

345.79 352.90 A: i think it boils down to where they kicked in the child abuse laws and all that we've lost control of our kids 

350.43 351.56 B: (( well it come- )) 

352.45 355.98 B: well it comes with how our children are taught 

356.44 362.04 B: if you if you're taught to a lot of p- a lot of parents are very competitive with their children 

362.21 365.35 B: [sigh] and and bully really bad so 

365.69 374.66 B: when they go to school they're bullying other kids and so forth instead of dealing with with this at home in our own backyards [sigh] we're dealing with this at school 

374.76 375.79 A: yeah 

375.41 381.22 B: and people are like well terrorism starts in different countries no it starts in our own back yard 

380.37 381.07 A: uh-huh 

381.24 382.95 B: it started right 

381.80 384.57 A: when we terrorize each other we have a problem 

384.59 392.67 B: yep and saddam is saddam or iraq is dealt with is dealing with that and that's why 

394.45 396.85 B: i think that's part of why we should've 

397.09 400.75 B: because of how many people saddam was killing of his own people 

400.61 402.00 A: yeah 

403.88 405.35 A: (( [noise] i mean in a way )) 

404.11 406.64 B: because it's not right to terrorize each other 

406.37 407.76 A: no it's not 

406.88 409.45 B: let alone another country 

411.97 417.45 A: but if they don't take him out of power they're set down there and build all these weapons against us that are 

417.47 420.26 A: they could just totally wipe us out with one blow 

417.70 418.64 B: yeah 

420.34 420.96 B: (( yeah )) 

421.60 425.88 B: the only strange thing is is i don't understand is why they didn't find any 

425.93 426.96 B: um 

428.05 430.89 B: weapons of mass destruction yet 

430.86 438.16 A: well i think they said they found a few the first couple of nights the war had started started that they had shot a few of 'em 

435.61 436.59 B: probably 

438.19 439.16 B: yeah 

438.55 440.35 A: actually launched them but 

440.67 445.49 A: all these ones that they say he has sitting back ready to use on us it's funny we can't find 'em 

445.45 453.98 B: uh-hum but yet they found one guy with like regular handguns or like four hundred regular handguns [sigh] whoop de do ya know 

452.17 452.85 A: (( mm i )) 

455.11 459.57 B: we have more weap- more handguns than that and yet 

460.13 471.42 B: [noise] they're supposed to have a lot more than we are in mass destruction and the only other thing is that i don't understand is why is it that every other country except for the united states 

471.45 476.88 B: um can't cannot have weapons of mass destruction but the united states can 

477.84 478.70 A: (( don't know )) 

479.93 481.98 B: is that stupid or what 

481.60 483.85 A: yeah it makes no sense to me 

483.83 486.60 B: because you look at [noise] um 

487.08 487.92 B: (( ah )) 

488.28 492.36 B: let me think here england england can't have them korea can't have them 

492.57 493.71 B: but yet 

493.94 495.02 B: we can [noise] 

496.76 501.42 B: and they're supposed to be our allies and stuff like that it's just stupid 

501.41 503.89 A: and what worries me the most about all that 

503.91 507.52 A: is the more we go to war which is like the third war 

507.99 510.03 A: since i've had my kids 

509.46 510.72 B: (( ah hum )) 

510.21 514.40 A: and it seems like every time something bad happens all of a sudden they want to run to war 

514.38 515.22 B: (( yep )) 

515.02 523.68 A: what kind of message is that sending to our kids because when they get older they'll all become dictators like saddam and think well war's the only answer 

518.34 519.58 B: that 

523.94 529.75 B: well i'm to the point of thinking that the way that bush is handling our country that he's becoming a dictator 

529.94 531.74 A: yeah 

531.64 533.71 B: (( because [noise] )) 

531.84 532.54 A: (( [noise] )) 

532.82 537.51 A: and when he launched his campaign about the war he started off saying we're going to attack terrorism 

537.88 540.56 A: and he brought up the whole nine eleven thing 

540.58 541.51 B: (( uh-hum )) 

540.92 546.02 A: i think he done that just to get enough support to be able to go ahead and get the war started 

545.85 547.08 B: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

546.48 549.88 A: and once the war had started he don't really care what the hell we feel 

549.71 552.67 B: uh-hum and the other thing is he doesn't understand that 

552.73 558.47 B: even though they brought terrorism to the united states we're bringing it right back to them 

558.54 560.56 A: which makes us just as bad as them 

560.39 569.70 B: yep if we would've just [sigh] went on our merry little way and made it out made it look like they didn't change us for no reason 

569.38 577.83 A: that's what they said to do was keep going on about your normal life not to let it affect you and what did we do we turn around and let us let it affect us yeah 

569.74 571.68 B: that we're still gonna fight for 

577.21 581.35 B: yeah [noise] yep we turn around and we just bomb the hell out of other people 

582.15 584.25 B: and bring terrorism to them 

585.27 590.95 B: [noise] and do it right back which is wrong on our part just as well as it is on their part 

592.10 599.89 B: i was always taught through the bible and stuff that two wrongs don't make a right and we haven't made any right
