0.65 2.83 A: uh rebecca gould is my name 

2.20 5.96 B: hi my name is bola i'm calling from washington d._c. 

6.32 9.51 A: hi are we good um 

6.92 8.05 B: how you doing 

9.53 13.86 A: uh well my opinion on the the subject is um 

13.84 25.02 A: that the united states should not involve itself um with with what's going on in iraq we should take care of um the people who are who need help in our own country 

25.99 30.23 B: yeah i think so too but um my feeling is 

30.48 41.95 B: don't you think a- according to what they're saying they're trying to say that they want to you know keep us safe in the future and you know prevent what happened on september eleventh to happen again 

33.77 34.81 A: mhm 

41.85 43.05 A: mhm 

41.90 49.97 B: and if um saddam does have you know weapons of mass destruction they're like scared that he might use it against america 

49.79 50.93 A: mhm 

50.08 63.43 B: so according to them i think they're trying to stop that that is why we have to you know sacrifice you know i believe in this life nothing comes easy no good thing comes easy we have to make some sacrifice i know that 

53.32 54.27 A: mhm 

60.41 61.28 A: true 

63.35 64.45 A: mhm 

63.39 73.14 B: so i think that is what um b- bush and his you know cabinets are you know trying to do right now to you know buy us future freedom and buy our children future freedom 

68.83 69.80 A: mhm 

73.11 74.18 A: mhm 

73.22 81.67 B: then after we make those sacrifices they might come back and you know tackle the issues of poverty and um joblessness and um 

81.66 89.71 B: unemployment and um health insurance and stuff like that that is what they are saying but um personally i don't understand everything 

85.54 86.50 A: mhm 

89.75 91.40 A: right [laughter] 

90.25 102.59 B: i don't understand it and i don't like war like i agree with you that um they should fix what is happening here and you know get people their jobs back and give homes to the homeless and stuff like that 

93.21 94.17 A: uh-huh 

99.19 100.45 A: mhm 

102.27 103.35 A: mhm 

102.63 107.62 B: (( you know that's a valid you know argument and their argument is valid too )) 

105.69 107.09 A: yeah 

107.52 109.40 A: uh-huh that's true 

107.94 109.23 B: (( but um )) 

109.37 110.35 B: like so 

109.51 117.59 A: i live in right i live in new york and uh when i'm on the subway there's there's uh militia army uh people from the army uh are 

117.48 125.59 A: are everywhere in the subways and they they're saying that it's costing us like uh forty million dollars a week and i just think of i mean i 

125.52 137.63 A: security is important but i mean also the the fact that um there's so many homeless people in new york city and there's budget costs in the library and education i think that should be a priority but 

127.20 127.99 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

134.67 135.52 B: mhm 

136.77 145.32 B: yeah yeah i i i believe you i believe you because um right now at my job you know a lot of people are facing the you know 

138.52 139.46 A: it's not 

139.49 140.37 A: uh-huh 

145.42 152.79 B: you know the fact that they might lose their jobs very soon at um my w- uh you know my husband works for one of the you know airlines too 

148.93 149.92 A: mhm 

152.83 154.09 A: oh uh-huh 

152.87 167.40 B: and um he's facing that too so i i really believe firmly that issue like face the problem in the united states right now and try to help people that needs their help instead of you know spending all that money on iraq and all that 

163.41 164.52 A: mhm 

167.35 179.11 B: and um i just believe that if since they've started with iraq now they should go to other countries and help them then if that is really what they want to do if they want to like liberate citizens from you know 

167.38 168.29 A: right 

171.45 172.57 A: mhm 

179.12 184.35 B: wicked um presidents and wicked rulers then they should go to all countries to do that 

184.10 185.31 A: mhm 

184.42 199.14 B: especially the african countries because there are a lot of african nations that have you know bad leaders and um their people really need to be l- liberated so if they want to start if they want to do that and liberate people then they should go around the world and help 

193.87 195.00 A: mhm 

199.27 206.78 A: uh-huh and what do do you think it would be better if the u._s. had other countries helping them rather than just acting alone 

199.74 200.68 B: you know 

206.74 217.11 A: you know there there was some sort of more um neutral um government that could you know because there's all the u._s. is always gonna push its own interests i guess is yeah 

214.56 220.94 B: of course definitely definitely they always put their own yeah push their own interests you know 

220.37 221.61 A: mhm 

221.00 223.84 B: so people just 

224.22 225.46 B: [sigh] i guess 

226.47 233.39 B: i think people just think it's not it doesn't look normal for them to like you know they're claiming right now they're liberating the people of iraq 

233.16 234.15 A: mhm 

233.41 238.26 B: there are thousands of nations that their people needs to be liberated too you know 

236.62 245.25 A: that's right that's right they just picked iraq because of the resources there yeah there needs to be some way to to um 

238.53 239.38 B: so 

241.20 243.26 B: exactly exactly 

245.23 251.18 A: to to monitor what the u._s. i mean the the u._s. can help other countries but i think they should also be watched right 

251.06 261.08 A: i mean there's like the u._n. that should be maybe more aggressive than it is and and um making sure there's justice for everyone not just the powerful countries 

253.95 255.07 B: exactly 

260.07 271.83 B: i know i know i know and we should just understand that we can't save the world you know we should just stay home and save our you know solve our own problems and um leave the world to god 

261.53 263.38 A: mhm [laughter] 

264.78 266.35 A: right that's true 

269.31 270.33 A: mhm

373.69 383.72 B: exactly he was like well this is what i signed up to do to defend the united states and um all that but we said yes we know that but we still prayed that he would not go to the war 

374.78 375.71 A: mhm 

379.33 380.39 A: mhm 

383.62 384.79 A: mhm 

383.95 387.87 B: (( you know my sister is young i don't want her to lose him now ))

393.03 394.68 A: (( [laughter] )) 

396.34 407.29 A: and it's interesting how many um of the people who are in the the uh soldiers at the front lines are not you know how many of them are um latino or african american 

407.32 413.36 A: compared to the people who are at the who are uh in charge and they're they're mostly you know [mn] 

413.59 422.84 A: most of them are are have or come from better you know a better um uh have a more privileged background it makes you think like the people who are dying i mean 

419.57 420.59 B: yeah 

423.39 430.85 A: they they they went into the many people i guess go into the military because they don't have as much opportunity so it's it's kinda sad

451.27 465.25 A: mhm saddam right yeah it's it's interesting uh like i was talking about the u._s. always pushes its its own interests because we supported saddam you know ag- when he when the iraq was fighting against iran 

464.84 466.40 B: yeah yeah 

465.58 469.18 A: so you see how there has to be some neutral you know 

469.22 482.23 A: they can also not not let the u._s. mess up the governments there and i just i mean there's there's a lot of in that area um the arab co- middle east there's a lot of governments that are repressive that i i would like for them to be more free 

482.15 488.75 A: but um also i i don't think you know it should be only the u._s. that decides like which one needs to be invaded or 

488.81 489.75 A: you know 

489.37 500.98 B: that's terrible that's terrible yeah you see that was what i was trying to say earlier they should not just like you know choose the countries they will that they will claim to go help the people who are there 

490.41 491.67 A: [laughter] 

494.44 495.61 A: mhm 

500.88 502.26 A: right 

501.05 504.51 B: you know they should really help those that are really in need 

504.01 506.47 A: yeah yeah exactly 

504.73 506.66 B: (( they should go to sierra leone )) 

506.62 507.86 A: mhm

536.76 538.18 B: so it's just so sad 

537.21 542.69 A: and it's the children children are forced to fight i've heard they make they have children who are soldiers and who 

542.34 548.14 B: exactly you see a nine year old a ten year old carrying you know guns and stuff like that 

542.81 544.32 A: that's really terrible
