152.41 153.64 B: right 

155.72 164.07 A: a listing of the question here it said why if y- if either of you could create a holiday what would it be and how would you have people celebrate it it

165.55 166.93 A: do you have any thoughts a- 

169.48 177.20 B: i would say that it would be um going to las vegas holiday [laughter] you know 

174.18 175.79 A: mhm [laughter] 

175.99 177.51 A: why is that [mn] 

177.47 187.64 B: 'cause i love las vegas i dunno i think it would be no no i just like it i i live in southern california so it's not that far away but i love las vegas it's great 

178.69 180.47 A: uh-huh are you from there 

181.21 181.88 A: (( oh )) 

183.88 185.00 A: (( oh ho uh-huh )) 

186.59 188.23 A: (( u- uh-huh )) 

187.90 195.11 B: um no it would be like a national day off and people er would just spend it um 

195.80 207.84 B: just leisurely it would be like almost req- like kind of like you know um the jewish faith has where you're supposed to go at sundown you're supposed to go in you're not supposed to go out after sundown 

197.03 197.71 A: (( m- )) 

207.39 208.37 A: mhm 

208.13 210.19 B: and friday night 

210.60 216.49 B: and it lasts until i don't know when on saturday but the thing is i guess yeah sundown to sundown i think 

213.06 213.89 A: mhm 

216.33 217.25 A: mhm 

216.53 223.60 B: something like that you know when you're required to be with your family or your friend and just do something leisurely you know 

222.96 225.49 A: (( m- mhm mhm that s- )) 

224.71 226.23 B: what would your idea be 

225.93 227.83 A: that sounds good 

227.38 228.18 B: (( [laughter] )) 

227.91 228.96 A: um 

229.58 231.71 A: (( i would um )) 

231.77 241.97 A: i think i really about having a- like an ex- you know an extended weekend you know where there would be um where you'd be off on a friday and a monday 

241.96 250.94 A: [laughter] so that you could have a really really long weekend and uh and you would have to 

242.56 243.83 B: (( there you go )) 

251.17 256.70 A: you wouldn't be required to but people would celebrate it by doing something 

256.79 263.64 A: um something within that time frame that required you to help somebody else 

263.72 266.65 A: you know like if somebody not necessarily 

264.11 265.53 B: mhm 

266.69 272.56 A: somebody in need but what if somebody you know you do something that you wouldn't normally do like 

272.62 273.81 A: um 

273.83 281.68 A: like i don't have a particular i don't have a house i live in an apartment so it's like um i might go mow somebody's 

281.79 291.64 A: mow somebody's yard or help somebody with with their garden you know something you know something that you would enjoy doing tha- that you don't necessarily have the access to 

289.77 291.44 B: mhm 

291.92 300.04 A: you know so y- you you would get to pick what that would be but but it would be something that somebody might need to have done you know like 

299.52 301.18 B: oh that's a good idea 

300.58 310.12 A: i'm good at orga- you know i like to organize you know so i might find somebody that has a really messy garage and and help them accomplish that task 

309.89 317.11 B: oh great you could come over here and organize my place that could be your first thing [laughter] yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

312.69 314.65 A: [laughter] 

315.77 328.49 A: you know 'cause that would be you know and it would be a reward for the recipient but but then something that you know you would enjoy doing too and you might not get a chance to do it you know that that kind of thing 

327.46 329.83 B: mhm yeah 

328.67 334.10 A: and then you know the rest of the time would be spent however you wanted to spend it just a you know really long 

334.22 337.79 A: a really long weekend you know involving 

336.94 338.30 B: mhm 

338.14 341.72 A: four days instead of two [laughter] [sigh] you know so 

340.35 350.31 B: [mn] that's a good idea how about a national crafting weekend or something like that or something like yeah ma- where you sit around and make things [laughter] 

341.74 342.80 A: i think that 

344.13 346.24 A: maybe that might be possible 

346.61 347.36 A: (( eh )) 

348.49 351.93 A: mhm mhm yeah that would be good too 

352.42 354.01 B: maybe teach people 

352.53 353.19 A: (( o- )) 

354.12 360.59 B: i don't know um when you co- when this topic comes on do you have the the chance to say no or not yeah uh 

360.66 364.93 B: i think you can choose whether or not you want to talk about this when the recording first comes on 

364.81 365.87 A: oh does it 

365.23 367.62 B: i don't know yeah i think s- 

366.33 367.56 A: 'cause uh i don't 

367.68 372.27 A: i didn't i didn't catch that then 'cause it sounded like they picked it and you didn't have a choice 

372.51 384.53 B: oh well i think you have the choice to say no if y- but i don't have that many ideas about holidays [laughter] i mean wh- um because holidays are like all the 

373.02 374.01 A: am i wrong 

379.09 380.44 A: yeah 

381.28 382.64 A: yeah that's the truth 

384.70 389.45 B: you know they try to make all these different holidays like secretaries' day and 

388.74 390.13 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

389.46 393.69 B: you know grandparents' day and all this and [mn] 

393.96 400.38 B: maybe i've become too cynical and mostly holidays are just stuff made up by the card companies now you know 

398.71 399.81 A: right 

400.07 401.28 A: yeah 

400.55 405.69 B: so it would hardly it would be hard to get another holiday going 

405.43 406.52 A: uh-huh 

405.78 406.68 B: you know 

406.70 409.55 B: [laughter] 'cause there's so many i mean now that people are like 

407.38 412.28 A: well you know they have it for everybody you know they have everything related t- 

412.14 425.36 A: you know if i ha- if i had to say anything about that as a criticism it's kind of like well they have a grandparents' day they have a secretaries' day they have a a mothers' day they have fathers' day but they don't have brothers and sisters' day and they don't have a singles' day 

425.27 426.46 A: you know they don- 

425.60 427.14 B: right 

426.33 430.26 A: they [laughter] or the you know and christmas is family and easter 

427.59 428.79 B: right 

430.07 444.54 A: is religious and you know and then there's other holidays named after people like martin luther king you know stuff like that which are and they're fine you know they're all well and fine but you know what about a fun holiday just a day where it's just every g- body gets to take a 

441.63 442.95 B: mhm

456.83 458.11 B: mhm 

457.50 471.86 A: some something where it's just got to be one day where it uh you know what about a singles' day that would be fun [laughter] you know just a something that's just you know kinda different you kn- kinda out there but but i don't know you know but
