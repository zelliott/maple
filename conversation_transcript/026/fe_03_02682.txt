9.69 11.47 A: (( oh get out of here )) 

10.89 12.00 B: no 

11.91 24.54 A: there used to be a time when i was uh when i was little i ha- i really hated my name 'cause nobody else had it and no one knew how to pronounce it [mn] but as i've grown older it's become kind of popular 

24.48 28.15 B: [mn] yeah it's a wonderful name it means [noise] glittering or shining 

27.90 29.84 A: yes i know [mn] 

29.17 32.45 B: and the topic's supposed to be [laughter] 

30.12 33.10 A: (( [cough] right holidays [noise] [mn] [noise] )) 

32.81 36.79 B: yeah what would you choose i would probably say 

36.86 38.18 B: [mn] family day 

38.59 41.08 B: a national holiday just for families [mn] 

41.33 47.49 A: [mn] yeah that would be good my favorite i think they want us to tell what our favorite one is too and why 

47.84 50.43 A: my favorite holiday is christmas 

50.74 51.98 B: definitely 

51.70 61.94 A: and the reason is because that's our lord's birthday that i i believe in jesus christ and it's a day that our enables me to 

62.03 67.05 A: children have presents but it also enables me to tell my children 

67.18 76.71 A: of the real reason behind it and people seem to be generally more giving at that time of year as far as getting along with each other 

74.10 75.29 B: (( they are )) 

78.29 79.34 B: [noise] they are 

78.33 80.69 A: [mn] so that's my favorite what's yours [noise] 

80.49 86.64 B: uh mine's also christmas because it's a time that like you said uh people are more giving more 

86.72 89.13 B: um [mn] precious 

89.52 90.89 B: disposition 

90.58 91.89 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

90.93 100.07 B: it's like the the love that god us through his son jesus christ is very prominent i just wish that same feeling could go on forever 

100.17 103.42 A: [mn] i know i know and [cough] 

103.60 104.83 A: just uh 

105.07 112.32 A: it's just a really good feeling time and you said that you would like a national holiday for family day 

112.33 116.02 B: yeah you've got mother's day you've father's day 

113.03 114.76 A: is that right yup 

116.16 117.01 A: (( [noise] )) 

116.27 119.09 B: but but there is no family day 

118.49 119.12 A: (( [mn] )) 

119.11 132.08 B: there's veterans' day uh you know there's the president's day any number of other days but you know we do we don't just have a family day when everything is strictly dedicated to the family 

132.26 136.90 B: whether it be single parent uh multiple parents or just what 

136.75 140.64 A: exactly [mn] i'd like i'd like to have a 

137.87 139.44 B: and [noise] [noise] [noise] 

140.94 147.58 A: a national peace day just one day that everybody just really 

147.62 151.90 A: prayed for all the you know all the people in all the world 

151.85 164.48 A: and and that it would be somehow done that you wouldn't just say oh oh okay well everybody just pray and you'll have done your part but to do a actually something meaningful on that day 

164.64 172.37 A: to promote peace even within your own family or or in someone else's family just um 

173.20 184.21 A: [mn] you know just a good shepherd's day really i mean just a a good peace day for to proclaim how america does want world peace 

184.28 197.71 A: an- and that that would be real important to me and i also like your idea of family day 'cause i think that's key important if you s- it starts in the families as to how we treat others you know 

197.99 198.99 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

198.34 208.20 A: so ah but in [mn] now i live in south carolina and our major thing right now is they're trying to get um martin luther king 

208.37 220.28 A: um be a recognized holiday for everybody because some counties recognize it and some counties don't now the state itself recognizes it 

220.46 233.67 A: and their position here is that the reason they're not they're saying they don't mind giving a for the counties a martin luther king day if the county workers will give up another because just to have one extra day 

233.55 239.14 A: would cost so many millions and our state is in a real financial crunch right now 

239.25 243.13 A: so i know if we were gonna have it a national 

243.23 244.79 A: extra day 

244.83 256.75 A: that i would have to probably give up some other day for it um i just was [mn] thinking about along those lines that uh i'd like to have that 

256.81 263.45 A: and there may already be like a world peace day but i would like a day for americans to really 

263.68 277.53 A: you know do something peaceful for each other in their own country because there's a lot of stuff we do outside of our country but our own country has so much uh violence in it and 

277.66 282.38 A: uh i i just would love to see something more happen at right here at home 

284.92 286.00 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] i )) 

284.98 288.26 A: [cough] how many of th- how many of these calls have you done 

288.31 293.96 B: uh this is my first one um i've actually received two others but it's the first one that i 

290.10 291.27 A: this is my 

294.19 296.00 B: pushed the right button on 

295.76 299.28 A: oh okay this this is my third one 

296.73 297.65 B: so 

299.83 311.35 B: uh it's a great way to be able to [mn] you know [mn] share with other people i live in alabama uh martin luther king is a day is a national uh or a state holiday here 

310.96 315.22 A: mhm is is it recognized by the counties also 

311.58 313.33 B: and it's just like 

314.88 321.74 B: oh yeah oh yeah and uh just i don't know if you were raised with um the southern 

315.70 316.61 A: okay 

321.88 329.21 B: uh bias but i was and uh it took a lot of education and 

326.69 327.25 A: (( [noise] )) 

329.27 336.61 B: ha- quite frankly uh learning to realize what kind of a humanitarian dr martin luther king was 

335.96 337.44 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

336.98 338.07 B: uh 

339.01 351.81 B: [mn] he did [mn] very very much i don't know what else to say on that subject but there's a lot of people that d- did not disclose their prejudices but at the same time uh [mn] you know 

343.80 344.66 A: yeah 

352.17 366.60 B: given everything that we have to look forward to right now i wish some of the love that he [mn] th- your topic as martin luther king as a holiday my topic or or my my sentiment would be why can't we have that same kind of a holiday 

366.50 372.48 B: like you said just peace day to that 'cause that's what martin luther king was all about 

368.39 369.66 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

371.74 383.34 A: well see we're having a big to do about this in south carolina and and i realize that it's an important uh it's important to recognize him and i do realize that 

383.22 388.12 A: but i think we we get so hung up on just individuals 

388.29 394.93 A: um for instance we don't have a uh john f. kennedy day and we don't have um 

394.94 401.33 A: who else is a great a ralph nader day for the consumer and things like that and 

401.59 404.15 A: but i i feel that 

404.45 405.14 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

404.61 408.14 A: the black people in our country need 

408.14 415.93 A: desperately to to have one of their own so to speak and i think he did a great deal to promote not only 

415.73 429.41 A: relations between black people but white people also and no i didn't grow up in the south i was uh i grew up in the north and um i came i've been down here now about thirty five years so i'm pretty 

420.47 421.42 B: (( [cough] )) 

427.99 430.25 B: [noise] [mn] welcome to alabama 

429.69 441.17 A: [laughter] yeah you know so uh yeah i it's it's a difficult it's a very difficult subject to talk about but um i'm i just really wish we could have 

441.80 451.24 A: and and i don't really know how to how to promote such a thing i i think it's it would be something i would have to sit down and think long and hard about as to 

451.17 459.55 A: we've never had the great national smoke out you know and if we as and which i think is very important but if we can do that for smoking 

454.74 455.55 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

459.57 462.61 A: i think we should be able to do something for 

462.72 463.92 A: our own 

464.01 470.90 A: human beings you know for human beings as as a population [mn] just something that would 

471.18 482.23 A: i mean we should be doing these things every day as as christians but um a lot of times we we get so wound up in our busy world i mean i'm certainly one of those people that 

482.43 489.72 A: sometimes i forget it's just a small thing sometimes if you just say something to somebody in the grocery line you know it's 

489.86 491.98 A: it's such a small thing 

492.01 498.35 A: [cough] but sometimes i'm just so wrapped up in what i've got to do excuse me for sounding so bad 

498.76 499.54 A: (( [cough] ))
