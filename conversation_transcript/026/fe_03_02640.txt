96.01 102.84 B: yes we- ah if anything what the u._s. government should be doing in iraq about a- arms inspection 

97.12 99.26 A: yeah i hope it's current 

100.48 102.11 A: (( mm )) 

102.76 103.60 A: yeah 

102.93 105.96 B: and if ah if it's a priority or not 

105.60 107.33 A: (( uh-hum )) 

106.81 108.87 B: [lipsmack] so what do you think ken 

109.13 117.61 A: well i ah i think we've done the right thing and we should continue to do what we're doing right now and [sigh] ah i firmly believe 

117.85 126.68 A: in our intelligence which caused us to ah to do as well as we did militarily and so i think that same intelligence will lead us 

126.80 135.89 A: to the weapons eventually [noise] so [sigh] i think we're doing the right thing and i think we should continue obviously i wa- was in favor of the war [laughter] you probably gathered that [laughter] 

135.24 136.34 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

136.61 137.72 B: (( [lipsmack] all right )) 

136.75 138.46 A: how about yourself 

137.95 143.35 B: ah i [laughter] pretty much think the opposite [sigh] but that's ah you know like 

139.35 140.10 A: (( [laughter] oh )) 

140.95 142.11 A: okay [noise] 

143.59 146.74 B: i think that it's not [sigh] 

147.22 149.74 B: i think the intelligence purpose is 

149.83 158.84 B: was not i mean i think people do like there's a lot of people here believe it's a good thing because they do believe it but i think they are made to believe it by 

159.11 161.55 B: by an intelligence and a government 

161.81 172.33 B: that's like that that makes people that makes people think that it's happening to like liberate people and make them more sec- more secure and all these things and [sigh] 

172.52 183.81 B: and it it's not true like it's other interests that are in case that are in question and these interests i think should not justify goi- going to another country and killing a bunch of people 

183.77 190.50 B: [sigh] but i mean i believe that it's the right thing to get saddam hussein out of power and all these things 

184.92 185.64 A: (( uh-huh )) 

190.54 192.22 B: but it could happen 

192.33 202.73 B: differently and mostly not under the cover that he has nuclear weapons because they haven't found them yet you know and as you said the military is very performing in very it's like very 

202.82 207.20 B: (( high technology and very like it's the best military in the world but if they really )) 

203.18 205.02 A: (( mm uh-hum [sigh] )) 

207.29 217.71 B: they i'm sure they would have looked i mean since they're so strong they would have found things already after so much time they would've found um nuclear weapons and they haven't found them yet so i think 

217.03 222.78 A: well not so much of a nuclear as they didn't really say nuclear it could be biological or chemical 

222.41 226.98 B: but they haven't said that they found them yet you know like i would 

222.90 223.73 A: and 

225.59 232.17 A: well but it's only been it's only been like less than two months [sigh] so and they said it's going to take some time because 

232.23 238.72 A: they're probably could be in a river they could be buried they could be in so many you know it's a big country [sigh] 

238.78 245.47 A: so i'm willing to give them the time and and so well from that point of view what would you say if they did find the stuff 

246.10 253.61 A: suppose tomorrow they said yeah we found it here it is it's proven and france agrees everybody else agrees it was there all along 

252.15 254.51 B: (( [sigh] oh well i'd be i'd be )) 

253.91 255.35 A: you would change your mind then 

255.23 265.97 B: well first if i heard that i i would be very very careful before i actually believe it like i would want not the u._s. intelligence to say it i would want like 

266.01 278.91 B: neutral like u._n. u._n. govern- like u._n. things inspectors to find them [sigh] and to like put their u._n. stamp on it [sigh] because i think they are very fast in claiming that there were nuclear weapons there and that 

266.29 268.18 A: (( [laughter] yeah [noise] uh-hum yeah )) 

269.16 270.33 A: uh-hum 

270.35 271.20 A: yeah 

271.61 272.91 A: (( [sigh] [noise] uh-hum )) 

278.72 288.74 B: remember how when they said they found things or [sigh] like then it came out that the reporters calling power game was like a paper written by a phd student ten years ago like 

282.28 283.03 A: yeah 

283.47 284.28 A: (( uh-hum uh-hum )) 

288.64 296.41 B: the the things that they have used to prove their points in the the next few months for me have been very like every times 

296.49 302.17 B: they they come they come up with like this oh okay we've got it you know we know they have them and every time it's 

302.21 306.80 B: investigated a little bit more it it turns out that these proofs are not valid 

305.15 318.90 A: well yeah be- but that's why they're investigating they're doing the investigation they were always saying in the beginning well we're not sure yet you know we're going to test it and see [sigh] but what to begin with what what what interests do you think we were trying to 

318.87 320.22 A: promote 

320.33 329.69 A: you said our self-interests what what exactly do you think we're the people in power hope to get out of this if not the stated reason of [sigh] 

329.95 334.91 A: uncovering these weapons and freeing the iraqi people what what interest is it 

334.17 343.08 B: [noise] [sigh] well i mean first like it's not we for example i don't include like you and like the u- like america's people you know because i i think that people 

341.35 345.54 A: uh-hum i said the people in power yeah i'm not in power [laughter] 

343.16 344.74 B: yeah yeah the nuclear 

344.86 359.36 B: yeah [laughter] because i think like people do believe in it for freedom i mean like maybe that's very like heard and reheard but the oil thing is definitely something but it's beyond that it's like more [sigh] like ah for power stability thing like 

346.50 347.49 A: yeah 

349.61 350.41 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

359.22 360.40 B: (( [sigh] because )) 

360.93 362.46 A: stability 

361.88 364.74 B: [lipsmack] like stability in the region like the u._s. thinks that if they 

363.70 365.57 A: well is that is that a bad thing 

365.46 373.50 B: well but it should the stability from like a a democratic government should come from [sigh] like the people of of iraq like 

366.99 368.66 A: i mean shouldn't we have stability 

372.85 373.90 A: (( uh-hum uh-hum )) 

373.40 381.64 B: [sigh] like doing their government because ah you ah if they're going to put in place a government that's obviously going to be in favor of the u._s. [sigh] and it's not going to be because for example 

381.59 389.53 B: you had sixty percent of the shiites people in the streets and they are the majority so if they voted democratically they would not elect anybody 

389.41 403.11 B: favorable to the u._s. and that's not what's going to happen so it's not going to be democratic [sigh] so the purpose the the stated purpose of giving iraq a democratic gov- democratic government is not is false according to me [sigh] and i mean 

403.84 405.88 B: also the fact that you know 

404.39 407.89 A: (( mm [noise] [noise] so wh- what yeah okay uh-hum [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

406.52 409.59 B: all the the halliburton contracts were signed like 

409.52 424.47 B: months before the war and all these contracts [sigh] that are benefiting u._s. industry and u._s. corporations [sigh] being signed [laughter] even before the war you know [sigh] even before they started looking for [sigh] pretext to go in makes me makes me think that these are serving like 

424.62 425.97 B: corporate [sigh] interests 

426.15 431.38 B: and ah things like like like chaney and all these people on board of directors of major companies 

427.39 428.15 A: (( uh-hum )) 

428.69 429.45 A: yeah 

430.58 436.46 A: so yeah given all that wh- what would have been your solution if you if you were in charge [laughter] [sigh] 

436.60 439.86 A: how would you have done this differently 

439.28 440.49 B: how would i have done 

440.48 441.25 A: yeah 

440.59 442.48 B: things differently [sigh] 

441.86 448.15 A: yeah i mean we would just just turn turn your back on it and say well it's not a threat to us so we're not going to do anything or 

447.92 458.89 B: no i mean like everybody i think even the people who are against the war i mean because for example i was against the war but [sigh] people who were like even governments who were against the war and as well as individuals everybody knows 

448.63 449.67 A: (( uh-huh uh-hum yes )) 

450.92 453.33 A: (( mm )) 

458.98 473.08 B: like saddam hussein is a bad person and he's doing nothing good for his people [sigh] but i think some the reason why he he stayed like that is that he was being reinforced by the fact that the sanctions were on [sigh] like first i would have lifted the sanctions because it's impossible for a country 

461.49 462.28 A: (( [noise] right )) 

462.44 463.18 A: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

472.41 476.46 A: oh lifted the sanctions right mm yeah [noise] 

473.97 480.73 B: yeah like ten years ago you know because when people are thinking day to day what they're gonna eat they have no time to think 

480.65 487.51 B: who they are gonna like about the marvellous thing of freedom like you know [sigh] they don't have the energy to do this because they are struggling like every day to 

487.31 496.22 B: like know what they're going to eat like having their children dying in the hosp- like because there's no they can- they couldn't get any medicine you know [sigh] right now the rhetoric is like oh we're building hospitals but 

496.12 506.49 B: these hospitals have been without any medicine for like ten years because of the sanctions first i would have lifted the sanctions a long time ago [sigh] and then like if saddam hussein was still in power and the people 

500.74 503.06 A: (( mm [noise] uh-hum [noise] [noise] )) 

505.47 506.26 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

506.30 514.50 B: were still showing to not be happy about him because i'm sure they would not be happy [sigh] i mean i'm sure if the sanctions the sanctions would have been lifted people would have 

514.53 519.64 B: if they really didn't like him they would have organized then got him out gotten him out of power 

519.68 527.41 B: oh i mean ah bush senior should have could have remove removed him out of power ten years ago and he didn't so that's a mystery to me [sigh] but 

525.33 526.91 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-huh ha [noise] mm [noise] )) 

527.59 539.52 B: i would've evaluated the situation and i would have you know like no country can go in because that's too like you're invading a country's sovereignty and you are yourself a country that's doesn't work but you should send u._n. teams 

539.66 545.46 B: [noise] to [mn] evaluate the problems [sigh] and then n._g._o.s to like educate the people and like 

545.66 548.39 B: educate them about how they could like 

548.58 550.06 B: you know build the infer- 

550.14 554.54 B: organize and make parties and like [noise] build part [noise] [noise] 

552.64 564.95 A: uh-hum [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] but the trouble is when you have a dictator like hussein who's so much in control [noise] and was such a threat to his people and was executing the people [noise] it's pretty hard to 

565.00 567.67 A: organize any kind of a revolt 

567.73 578.61 A: when they know that n- not only they but their family would be at such risk [sigh] and from the prisons that we've liberated and ah areas that we've discovered [sigh] 

578.82 585.03 A: everything from the torture chambers to the killing fields i i don't see how 

585.10 587.71 A: we could have ever encouraged them to 

588.33 589.94 A: (( [noise] revolt [noise] i )) 

589.83 590.63 B: (( [sigh] i mean )) 

590.51 593.63 A: mean he had his thumb over it in such a manner that ah [noise] 

593.92 596.12 A: i don't see how we could've done anything mm 

596.18 598.95 B: [sigh] i i agree that it would've been
