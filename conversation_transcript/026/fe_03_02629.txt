344.79 345.87 A: different things 

346.29 348.04 B: yeah 

347.90 350.11 A: so it's all over the country cool 

350.55 354.39 B: yeah pretty weird since it's like the university of pennsylvania 

354.86 356.41 A: yeah yeah 

354.95 359.30 B: well there is other people who found out about it but 

358.48 359.71 A: yeah 

361.03 364.26 A: yeah but this kind of topic i don't know it seems like they 

364.98 368.05 A: um it is kind of hard to talk about cause it's already 

368.20 370.16 B: yeah it's already happened so did 

368.45 371.10 A: [laughter] yeah so 

371.65 381.49 B: you see that picture of the uh soldiers sitting in like this real expensive chair in one of saddam's palaces and they were like smoking a cigarette [laughter] 

380.94 383.98 A: (( oh that was funny [laughter] )) 

382.45 384.56 B: yeah that was great 

384.51 387.42 A: (( oh it is [laughter] )) 

388.56 390.20 A: what about do you think he's 

390.50 392.51 A: alive or do you think he's dead 

392.54 395.31 B: uh i don't know it's hard to say 

395.52 404.21 A: yeah i know i i all along thought he was then yeah it's just hard to say you don't know if he's gonna twenty years from now you know pop up somewhere 

404.40 405.07 A: (( [laughter] )) 

404.41 405.42 B: yeah 

405.21 406.13 A: so 

406.36 407.95 A: (( yeah i don't know )) 

409.01 412.08 B: my guess is that they got him but 

409.20 410.45 A: (( [mn] )) 

411.97 414.78 A: yeah i that's what i would think so too 

415.88 417.58 B: i'm kind of worried about the 

417.91 422.83 B: the whole like link between bin laden and iraq 

421.52 422.45 A: yeah 

423.39 427.35 B: that's not really firmly established in my mind yet 

426.89 428.14 A: yeah 

427.49 430.08 B: seems like two separate things 

429.67 431.21 A: yeah i know 

431.07 437.32 B: we're gonna go bomb the crap out of iraq because wait a minute [laughter] 

431.26 432.88 A: cause yeah 

436.40 448.67 A: yeah [laughter] really no say yeah cause i mean like on the other hand you know bin laden's still what if he's not dead and yeah [laughter] so it's kind of yeah 

446.66 451.24 B: yeah and he's not even from iraq he's from he's from afghanistan isn't he 

452.11 454.34 A: he is yeah i think so 

454.62 456.57 A: he's from somewhere else yeah 

457.11 469.57 A: yeah i know it is kind of weird thinking it's like what if yeah what if something else happens would it you know like they're two different cases and you know what if he pops up and does something else [laughter] 

469.37 471.03 B: yeah 

470.15 472.95 A: (( so yeah it is kind of )) 

471.95 475.33 B: can't really go bomb bomb iraq some more [laughter] 

474.69 477.77 A: yeah [laughter] what more can they do [laughter] 

477.22 479.12 B: could bomb syria for a while 

479.05 485.52 A: yeah [laughter] i think they pretty much done their do over there [laughter] move on so 

483.26 484.27 B: yeah 

485.72 490.04 A: (( yeah i know it's just uh it is scary thinking but i )) 

490.30 491.14 A: mean 

491.28 494.15 A: (( we have to do what we have to do but yeah is that kind of )) 

495.14 496.98 A: a scary case [laughter] 

497.17 498.04 B: yeah 

497.43 498.57 A: but um 

498.71 500.28 A: (( that is [noise] )) 

500.39 508.62 A: they're still i mean they're [noise] then hopefully [noise] you know something doesn't [noise] pop up like september [noise] eleven again [laughter] 

508.49 510.21 B: yeah 

509.41 511.38 A: all of that so 

511.98 514.45 A: yeah it is scary thinking but [laughter] 

514.44 524.67 B: of course the other thing is i wonder is if the government's really if they've caught bin laden or if they were for sure saddam's dead or either way and then like can't tell us for some reason 

521.36 522.77 A: yeah yeah 

524.54 529.59 A: yeah that's what i'm thinking like maybe they yeah know more than what they really tell you and 

529.87 538.80 A: yeah or if like saddam's not dead and you know [laughter] you think he's marching all of these guys in his palace [laughter] tearing those pictures down [laughter] 

535.71 536.92 B: [laughter] 

538.20 540.46 B: yeah i think he was behind like a mirror 

540.38 544.65 A: yeah [laughter] he's either really scared or just 

544.66 548.23 A: [laughter] or just yeah or else he's 

548.27 552.30 A: planning on something but i i would think they probably 

552.86 553.82 A: got him 

554.56 560.49 A: that would be my guess but god i mean i would just think he's the type of person who would um 

554.66 555.60 B: yeah 

560.77 569.56 A: you know if he wasn't dead would [noise] you know would come out or something you know i just same as bin laden i just wonder about him too [laughter] 

569.77 571.17 A: is he really 

569.95 570.87 B: yeah 

571.15 573.32 B: if they got him in one of those caves 

573.32 586.32 A: yeah i wonder yeah cause i know i've heard different like people talking stuff and they say that you know his past history he's not the type that if he was alive he would just let 

586.39 590.46 A: you know you wouldn't we haven't even heard from him in all this time so 

590.43 591.70 B: right 

591.30 593.86 A: so yeah so i just don't know [laughter] 

594.11 599.89 A: keeping low or is he crazy you don't know what you know [laughter] you don't know really what's have on their mind 

597.25 598.25 B: yeah
