146.63 148.02 B: [laughter] 

148.63 153.12 B: i think i'd i'd feel silly doing it like i'd feel completely out of place [laughter] 

152.25 158.55 A: right exactly it it's it's just not the it's just not the traditional thing that you'll expect to have you know 

157.91 158.80 B: uh-huh 

158.75 165.90 A: and um you know it's just you know and it's the for kids and you know it and even adults and you just bring in new traditions every year 

165.57 166.58 B: yeah 

166.01 170.33 A: i mean we added this year we added from it was my family we added a secret santa 

170.33 179.86 B: [laughter] we did that on uh we do that among my roommates as well we all come together and we do a secret santa we went out for the uh christmas dinner this year right before we went home for a for break 

171.00 171.80 A: and 

179.62 180.53 A: uh-huh 

179.78 190.20 B: and we all you know exchanged gifts and had a nice dinner together and it was a lot of fun like it was a good bonding experience [laughter] and we're all you know we we all like enjoyed the the whole night so 

189.91 199.19 A: right exactly i mean you know that's that's the fun of it you know getting together with people and and and you know family friends and it's not just a gift that's 

199.36 202.36 A: you know in some cases that's important but that's not the key 

202.21 203.27 B: mhm 

202.56 209.88 A: the key is is actually setting the time and saying you know this has to be done because it's the holiday times that we have to get together 

209.52 210.41 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

210.13 219.02 A: because you don't set enough time during the rest of the year you think you're too busy or you just you know you just don't set the time to do all of that and that's 

217.50 218.52 B: (( mhm )) 

219.17 226.80 A: to me that you know that's important um you know to just you know to spend time with the people that you want to spend time with 

226.55 227.59 B: mhm 

226.98 228.83 A: [noise] and um 

229.50 232.98 A: and you know you sometimes don't get to see people unless it's the holidays 

232.76 246.12 B: yeah exactly and like with this on a school schedule as well like christmas is the home coming like you get to you get to go home for a long period of time and see old friends if you know if they're coming home as well and see family that you've been away from for four or five months you know 

246.13 260.27 A: exactly that's that's a definite you know that's definitely true [noise] in my family my cousin has six children and i spend my holidays with them and they're spread around at one point they were spread around four three different states [noise] the only holiday everybody came home for was christmas eve 

246.20 248.94 B: (( it it's the kids' break and )) 

259.68 272.97 B: yeah and that i mean that just adds a lot more like it it's a lot more special if everybody you know 'cause everybody everybody has to make the effort to come together and people will do it for christmas so you know it's everybody's joint effort to get together it just makes it that much more meaningful 

271.79 277.53 A: i mean and even some of the kids are divorced you know and their and the rule is that that they the 

275.00 276.31 B: mhm 

277.42 292.05 A: the grandchildren are with them christmas eve so that all of the kids are together all the grandchildren everybody gets to see everybody at that time [noise] and that's important that's important for you know for for everybody 

280.81 281.74 B: (( mhm )) 

287.26 288.17 B: yeah 

292.34 300.09 A: and um [noise] you just you know you buil- buil- and you build on traditions and that's i think it's important to have some sort of tradition 

299.93 312.04 B: mhm yeah i mean even if it's not a strong religious tradition as well like just to have you know the whole coming together and just spending time together like i know my my family has a pretty strong christian background my dad's a a minister 

304.17 304.82 A: (( mm )) 

311.68 312.74 A: mhm 

311.83 319.35 B: [laughter] so so we do all of the you know the religious aspect of it as well but just just the tradition of being together and spending the time together i think is 

319.24 324.36 A: right i mean what we and we're very we're very big on singing christmas carols 

320.11 321.42 B: (( right up there so )) 

323.96 327.90 B: yeah we always have christmas carols [laughter] around my neighborhood yeah 

325.73 326.88 A: and and 

327.08 332.20 A: and what we while well we do it within the family 'cause there's like thirty people at at the christmas eve 

331.41 332.24 B: uh-huh 

332.25 343.00 A: and what we end up having is um the newest person you know like who brought their new boyfriend or new girlfriend or whatever they have to be the partridge in the pear tree 

342.67 344.19 B: oh god [laughter] 

343.15 348.91 A: when we do the twelve days of christmas so every time we get to a partridge they gotta stand up and say that you know 

348.38 350.09 B: (( [laughter] )) 

348.95 351.91 A: and a partridge in a pear tree

359.38 360.55 B: [laughter]
