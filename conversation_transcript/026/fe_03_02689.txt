134.15 135.41 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

134.63 141.56 B: 'cause it was just all a weather path right down through uh the ozarks there that we we'd get quite a bit of snow 

139.22 140.15 A: yeah 

141.96 147.42 B: and i like snow but you know i like the south i like uh having very little snow so 

147.38 154.68 A: yeah that that definitely sounds like a positive i really i don't like i don't like this cold weather but i love the city so i feel like i'm stuck here [laughter] 

154.23 165.80 B: right yeah i understand yeah and i like the country we live out in the country so right yeah we're uh i guess it'd be eighty miles to the closest large city for us

192.76 193.56 B: (( uh-huh )) 

193.74 202.10 B: y'all exchange gifts and that type thing uh for christmas or do you all just get together more than the ex- exchange of gifts 

202.01 216.95 A: um my my mom has a rule that none of our gifts can cost for each other can cost more than ten dollars so it's usually more of a like a creative trying to figure out what you can do that's meaningful and and it's cheap and she thinks that that's like the most fun way to do it so that's what we usually do 

217.38 223.82 B: [noise] well yeah that that would be for sure uh yeah um trying to come up with a ten dollar gift these days 

219.81 221.03 A: (( yeah it's fun )) 

223.25 224.88 A: [laughter] yeah it's hard 

223.89 226.69 B: would be quite a chore [laughter] 

226.57 228.81 A: yeah it's usually making something 

227.87 235.59 B: [noise] [noise] yeah yeah now that would be a neat thing to do is to make things and exchange what you've made that would mean a lot more also 

235.42 242.70 A: yeah it turns out you know it winds up being a lot of fun what what do you usually do for the for the fourth of july like do you have fireworks and stuff or 

241.89 252.70 B: [noise] [noise] ah yes yes uh-huh we kind of all go in and we each bring you know um a a few fireworks each and of course time we get together there are a little over fifty of us

356.36 357.11 B: no 

357.22 363.23 B: but um you know and it it's you know outside and you know then when it gets dark we do the fireworks 

363.00 363.86 A: mhm 

363.32 371.21 B: um and we just sit around and you know kinda visit we usually si- stay up 'til after midnight on uh the fourth of july just visiting

371.20 372.33 A: (( wow [mn] ))

377.60 378.49 A: wow 

377.85 387.58 B: uh so we usually try to arrange at least two days when everybody is there and they can you know we both my parents live out in the country on like a three hundred acre you know farm 

387.42 388.29 A: mhm 

387.93 392.00 B: so we have electrical outlets so you know you can pull in campers 

391.65 392.54 A: uh-huh 

392.19 399.37 B: and uh hook 'em up to the uh electricity and um pretty big pretty much comfortable you know during the the heat 

399.73 407.45 B: and of course the nights are you know it's kinda muggy but you know the nights are pretty good to sit out under the shade trees and uh just in 

406.57 407.67 A: (( [noise] mhm wow )) 

407.54 412.08 B: folding lawn chairs and uh enjoy the time 

412.12 417.32 A: [noise] is that how often how often does your family like your whole family get together like that 

416.87 418.53 B: every fourth of july 

418.26 422.00 A: that's that's like like you don't get together for other holidays or anything 

421.19 423.16 B: no no because it 

422.07 424.85 A: i imagine it would be hard there's so many of you [laughter] [noise] 

424.45 434.88 B: uh right and you know they have kids and then they have grandkids so you know at christmas they want to be either at home or you know with their grandkids and this type thing so you know you you don't wa- want to all come in 

432.31 433.25 A: mhm 

435.23 440.50 B: uh we tried that you know before we got so large and it just kind of 

440.89 444.10 B: w- we just didn't have enough space inside 

443.38 444.77 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

444.29 450.20 B: um you can kind of tolerate the heat the coldness kids can't really tolerate being cold 

448.87 452.26 A: yeah yeah that's understandable yeah [laughter] 

451.29 455.78 B: yeah so it just makes a a big difference you know with the weather you know 

455.86 460.94 B: outside kids don't know it's hot you know so let 'em run and rip at night and no big deal 

461.54 462.53 A: (( mhm mm yeah )) 

463.15 464.34 A: (( that's cool )) 

463.20 464.01 B: so 

465.00 470.97 A: so what's it like being from such a large family 'cause i'm i'm an only child so i don't really know what that's like 

470.11 483.09 B: oh you're kidding [laughter] well you know i wouldn't know how to relate to being the only child because actually there's seven of us there are three younger and three older than i am so i am the absolutely the middle child 

471.54 472.88 A: yeah [laughter] 

475.29 476.74 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

482.43 484.14 A: uh-huh wow 

483.39 497.57 B: so you know i i wouldn't know because uh you know i'm not the oldest so i don't know how it would be to just be one you know the one or you know the baby and that we were all gone by the time you know and she was home by herself so they can more relate to that 

497.45 498.26 A: mhm 

497.61 510.28 B: but you know i would you know i i can't imagine being the only child because i mean when we were growing up it was like you know it was like a we always had somebody to play with and you know we always had things to do and 

510.24 524.15 B: we were always into something you know and it's kind of pulled over into the holid- you know the fourth of july thing you know because all of us get together and we're all always talking about what we got into when we were kids and this type things so 

512.55 513.63 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

517.58 518.67 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

523.76 524.64 A: (( wow )) 

524.62 526.42 B: so that's like kind of a 

526.85 532.52 B: major thing you know [noise] for the holiday to discuss you know old times 

531.88 532.75 A: uh-huh 

532.99 533.76 B: so 

534.02 542.04 A: so what is the what is the age range of people that get together on the fourth of july like how how old is the youngest person and how old is the oldest person 

541.41 544.93 B: [noise] well my mom um and dad are both eighty four 

544.73 545.69 A: wow 

545.61 557.64 B: and uh then of course the youngest uh the last fourth of july uh was only like probably about three months old and that was a great ne- uh nephew of mine so it would be like a 

552.72 554.00 A: oh wow 

555.81 556.63 A: uh-huh 

557.66 559.48 B: great uh 

559.74 562.00 B: grandchild to my parents 

561.55 562.42 A: uh-huh 

562.51 564.23 B: so uh 

564.71 565.63 A: wow 

565.24 573.89 B: he would have been the youngest but it so the age range is from like eighty four this year it would be like from eighty four down to um let 

567.02 567.93 A: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

573.98 581.20 B: me see if we're expecting and i can't remember if we're expecting any new ones before the fourth or not i know we're expecting a new one in october 

581.01 581.92 A: wow 

581.49 587.78 B: but i guess the youngest one now would be you know uh he'll be uh ab- about fifteen months old 

587.94 588.79 B: um 

589.47 590.30 B: so 

590.52 592.52 A: (( mhm [noise] wow [laughter] )) 

592.74 599.95 B: so this is this quite an interesting thing uh you know uh of course you know i'm in my fifties my brothers are
