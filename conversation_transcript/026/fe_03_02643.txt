206.62 217.24 B: [laughter] [noise] you know that is one of the two things w- why the jewish people have survived all the horrors that they've lived through [sigh] one is an adherence to their faith 

217.30 219.90 B: [lipsmack] and the second is a great 

219.73 231.04 B: sense of humor usually self-deprecating an- and one of my favorite things i've got is a picture frame little things i've cut out from here and there and i just mentioned it to a brother in law whom i haven't talked to in two years [sigh] 

230.88 236.78 B: blessed are they who can laugh at themselves [laughter] for they shall never cease to be amused 

236.51 238.59 A: [noise] ah yeah yeah

245.89 254.59 A: oh well i guess i guess we kinda we went off topic here didn't we i'm trying to think [sigh] i'm trying to think if i could create a holiday what it would be ah 

255.47 263.83 A: [lipsmack] just i i i'm thinking that i'm thinking i would rather than creating a new one i would take an old one and kinda redefine its meaning or something 

255.95 257.17 B: (( [lipsmack] you are )) 

262.98 264.43 B: [lipsmack] such as [noise] 

264.20 269.60 A: i don't know maybe take valentine's day and make it less materialistic or something

270.04 274.70 A: you know make it you know never mind the the candies and the the flowers 

270.99 271.55 B: (( [sigh] )) 

273.29 283.06 B: yeah well they've all become so commercial i'd have a totally different take on that [sigh] which we try to should be doing and i think we try to do it there might be [cough] 

274.83 275.63 A: (( you know )) 

282.95 296.08 B: excuse me a holiday [sigh] you know a love thy neighbor holiday [sigh] love thy neighbor as thyself which [sigh] i mean you have to the world is so small and everybody is a human being it doesn't matter th- 

287.67 288.69 A: yeah 

296.05 303.25 B: that that skin tones are different or that [sigh] you approach ah religion in a different way because ah actually all religions 

303.25 315.01 B: are just different streets i i may take a main street to get to where i want to go which is probably heaven and you might take [sigh] fourteenth street [sigh] and someone else takes this boulevard and someone else takes that 

311.17 312.13 A: right 

313.91 316.61 A: but it's the same it's the same [noise] 

315.15 319.95 B: pike and we're all going the same way we're just taking different directions [laughter] to get there 

320.18 327.76 B: so i i would i would like to see a three hundred and sixty five year holiday awareness of love thy neighbor as thyself 

327.72 329.92 A: right right and just kind of

354.15 361.00 B: those ten commandments boil down to one [sigh] and that is do unto others as you would have them do unto you 

360.92 362.51 A: (( yeah [noise] ))
