343.78 346.39 A: well i think this year they might [laughter] 

345.65 360.14 B: yeah i think i think so but ah i think in general most years people don't even think about the ah significance of it they just look at it as a you know the summer holiday a chance to [sigh] take a few days off of work and have a long weekend or something 

354.35 355.26 A: (( [noise] right )) 

360.01 361.36 B: [sigh] but ah 

361.47 375.27 B: but that's that one's ah one of my favorites now of course we have cinco de maya coming up which ah really has nothing to do with the united states but a lot of people use it as a excuse to get a drink so [laughter] along with st patrick's day
