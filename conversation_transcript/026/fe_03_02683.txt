15.84 17.78 B: i think it's new years 

18.60 19.62 B: um 

18.67 20.66 A: fascinating how how come [mn] 

20.92 26.25 B: because everybody stays everybody gets together and and drinks that why 

25.36 26.71 A: [laughter] 

26.38 34.21 B: and it's pure celebration and it's it's you know [mn] there's no pretension there's no symbols for it first of all except for 

34.39 48.16 B: except for champagne glasses you know halloween you've got something like black cats and and you've got pumpkins which only really go into a pie and whatnot you know you've got christmas which has got like santa claus 

48.13 53.22 B: but new years has got no no symbol and people get together and just have a good time 

48.48 49.97 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

53.22 61.58 A: [noise] [mn] just just out of curiosity what's is it bad to have a symbol for you or is it good to have a symbol it sounds like it's bad how come [noise] 

60.96 72.94 B: it's kind of bad to well it's not bad to have a symbol it's just meaningless more than anything it's kind of it kind of falls flat for me 'cause it it it just i don't know it makes it kind of contrived 

73.44 76.71 B: it makes it uh i don't know like you know 

77.13 83.26 B: you know like uh fourth of july would be al- you know would almost be the uh the other one for me but 

79.32 80.01 A: (( [noise] [noise] [mn] )) 

83.06 95.47 B: then it's get- then it's all wrapped in the american flag and everything and and you know we're supposed to be proud of our government and our military on that day and i i just don't i don't get that um 

95.42 99.21 B: so i'd rather just have one where there's no symbol [laughter] [noise] 

99.12 102.50 A: interesting and and you like the celebration with champagne 

103.34 112.98 B: yeah i like i like uh champagne i know that eggnog is the other but it's not really a visual symbol anyway but yeah i like the uh 

111.49 113.03 A: (( that's so funny )) 

113.90 121.69 B: i like that aspect of it every other holiday has got symbols to it and it's just it kinda makes it corny and contrived i think every you know 

121.55 130.38 B: new years is the one that's kind of neutral on that on that you know aspect of it and you know it's just people celebrating the new year 

130.56 141.73 A: yeah what if what if new year um didn't fall on new years but was a different day it was just a celebration of happy spring would it would it still have the same effect for you [noise] 

130.79 132.42 B: and 

142.83 152.38 B: spring yeah it would actually it it wouldn't matter what day it is because you know the roman calendar is just an abstract kind of idea you know i mean 

151.69 152.54 A: [noise] um 

152.75 154.82 A: as you can tell i live near the train

167.14 168.71 B: oh okay 

169.30 177.18 B: san franci- i haven't been there yet that's one of the only major cities i haven't been to yet in this country i'm actually i'm from new york and i've been everywhere

177.25 178.60 A: oh it's it's good 

177.55 178.47 B: but 

178.67 180.44 B: so what's your favorite holiday 

180.64 181.68 A: christmas 

181.85 183.91 B: christmas why is that 

182.87 183.83 A: yeah 

184.29 195.12 A: eating [laughter] baking decorating it's it's all the things associated with it i'm i'm an atheist and don't believe in in god um but i just like all the 

185.56 186.93 B: eating mm 

192.08 193.67 B: (( [laughter] )) 

195.26 205.59 A: decorating of the house and baking and giving presents and anticipation and then it's always a serious let down afterwards but [laughter] i i like christmas 

204.16 205.42 B: wow 

205.92 206.92 A: yeah 

206.04 219.45 B: i i'm wow that's kinda cool how you're an atheist at the same time and yet you celebrate christmas i'm kinda like the same well i'm i'm completely unreligious like i i don't think i'm i don't think i'm an atheist quite i think i'm more of an agnostic but 

219.45 228.20 B: uh i grew up in a huge catholic family and everything and um i don't know er christmas kind of falls- it's kind of a letdown in that way 

228.35 229.52 B: um 

229.33 230.97 B: 'cause [mn] i i don't know 

230.86 245.09 B: it it's like there's the mixture between you know i'm against kind of religion and commercialism and that's kind of what surrounds me about that day but at the same time you know every every virtue that you just pointed out about it was kind of cool i mean that's that's what i like about christmas too 

243.99 244.89 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

245.00 246.04 B: (( [laughter] )) 

245.11 246.40 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

246.31 260.64 A: we're either [noise] the part [sigh] [noise] [laughter] cleo says christmas christmas the the part that's funny to me is i'm i was raised by um i guess you'd say probably that we were a christian family but we were raised as little agnostic children 

246.40 248.05 B: gift giving and [laughter] okay mhm 

259.68 267.65 B: (( hm )) 

260.63 263.33 A: and then i converted to judaism but 

263.35 276.68 A: whilst still being an atheist [mn] i go to my rabbi and say you know i'm here because i i like the spiritual um moral compass of judaism but i still don't believe in god and so here i am as jew being 

276.65 281.07 A: you know celebrating christmas [laughter] but i still don't believe in god 

281.31 283.40 B: (( wow hm )) 

282.13 295.39 A: so it's kinda kinda strange but yeah i just like baking i like decorating the house i like the celebration of having lots of people over to the house be able to um make presents for people or buy them presents and 

295.38 297.79 A: um i just like that part celebrating 

299.01 302.77 A: [mn] so i i i'm with you though fourth of july who gives a rat's ass

303.60 307.03 A: yeah [laughter] 

305.64 309.55 B: right i especially i'm not too proud of our government right now anyway so 

309.12 317.86 A: [laughter] it's just i just do- i mean in terms of holiday celebration um maybe i can be excited that america was born 

317.87 326.03 A: that's that's nice but in terms of for me baking what am i going to make oh whoopee you know something red white and blue okay fine 

325.28 339.67 B: right there's a there's a more participatory element to it in christmas like you know so far as hosting and uh getting together there's more of a uh you know like you feel more participation into it or y- you know in the holiday 

329.96 330.52 A: (( yeah )) 

339.39 351.29 A: [noise] yeah and it's a one shot deal fourth of july one day not a whole lot of build up to it at least with with christmas there's a whole lot of inte- again it is okay you can say it's one day but oh oh well 

339.58 340.38 B: rather 

344.65 345.62 B: no 

351.44 362.15 A: so yeah ha- halloween never got into it other than throwing um one day we ran out of um halloween candy and so we threw cherry bombs at the little kids that came to the door 

361.16 362.63 B: (( hm )) 

362.01 370.77 A: okay that was a bad judgment day but i was only in fifth grade so i guess you can excuse that [laughter] that that was fun though 

368.69 369.71 B: (( [mn] man ))
