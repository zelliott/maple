0.00 0.40 B: (( [noise] )) 

0.80 2.51 B: hi i'm charlesetta 

1.14 2.16 A: (( hi i'm )) 

2.87 3.86 A: charles 

4.56 6.13 B: [noise] i'm charlesetta 

6.19 7.37 A: i'm charles 

6.96 13.37 B: [noise] oh you're charles okay [laughter] [laughter] i'm calling from savannah georgia where you calling from 

9.13 10.49 A: [laughter] 

14.18 16.83 A: up in oregon up here in portland 

16.03 19.52 B: [noise] [noise] oh okay and is this your first call 

19.93 21.29 A: it is actually 

20.82 23.01 B: [noise] oh okay mine too 

23.44 25.28 B: so how do we start this [noise] 

26.06 29.30 A: well we're supposed to be talking about holidays and if we could create one 

29.62 30.64 B: what would [noise] 

29.82 32.51 A: what we would do and how we'd celebrate it so 

33.22 36.46 B: would you create one if you could [noise] [noise] [noise] 

37.15 45.96 A: i don't know [mn] most of the holidays that we have tend to be over commercialized anyway so i'm not sure that creating a new one would necessarily do any good 

46.86 48.49 B: you you think so 

48.53 52.78 B: but how did you feel about the creation of martin luther king's holiday 

55.80 58.08 A: (( mm [sigh] )) 

58.77 62.48 A: (( i don't know it has a lot of meaning behind it a lot of holidays do )) 

62.66 63.75 A: um 

64.18 77.05 A: the holidays that we've created as a nation to be able to celebrate people who've done great things for the country tend to actually have a little bit more meaning behind them than holidays that have a religious backing 

71.68 72.81 B: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise] )) 

76.71 78.13 B: right right 

78.24 83.91 B: um and i think that particular holiday is under celebrated 

83.97 86.47 B: because as time goes on 

86.88 94.74 B: the newer generations don't remember the struggles that we older generations went through to get to this point 

93.37 94.35 A: (( that's right )) 

95.27 102.08 B: um and like christmas used to be um a holiday of reflection 

102.45 105.25 B: now it's more of a commercial holiday 

105.60 113.37 B: what can i buy you know the stores are how many people can we get into the to the store how many sales can we make 

113.65 118.68 B: um we've commercialized so much that creating a holiday another holiday 

119.29 127.49 B: wouldn't benefit the beneficia- beneficial to us spiritually but only monetarily i think 

127.71 128.75 B: how do you feel [noise] 

129.91 132.49 A: well if i did create a holiday it would have 

132.65 137.89 A: absolutely nothing to do with giving anybody anything other than time and attention 

135.95 137.02 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

137.36 140.18 B: (( right [mn] um wha- [noise] )) 

138.95 144.54 A: and it wouldn't even be like how valentines day is how supposedly you're supposed to be spending time with the person you love 

144.24 145.28 B: right 

144.63 147.48 A: uh at this point it's oh gee what can i buy them 

147.20 153.75 B: i know let let me get some candy or some flowers but ev- everybody's standing on the corner selling something for a holiday 

154.18 155.02 A: (( uh [sigh] )) 

154.19 155.12 B: i will 

155.23 158.19 B: i would like to see um september eleventh 

158.23 162.65 B: celebrated or recognized in some kind of way what do you think 

163.95 172.12 A: i think that that would kind of spur things on on both positive and a negative side though 'cause you have usually you have some people that would 

172.32 185.57 A: be very violent about saying [noise] all that that's doing is celebrating terrorist attacks instead of saying celebrated how a nation got together to stand together after 

185.76 186.93 A: attacks [noise] 

186.64 187.53 B: right 

187.91 199.94 B: [noise] um we come from a military background so for us it would be more of a reflection of how like you said a a nation coming together and reflecting um on such a 

200.37 201.86 B: devastation 

202.17 207.97 B: and and it i feel it's one day we could all as a nation say 

209.49 215.14 B: we it happened to all of us it wasn't just a particular group [noise] 

214.18 215.21 A: yeah 

215.38 220.69 B: um this was a mass destruction it it'd it even affected other countries 

221.17 225.53 B: and those countries rallied um together as well with the u._s. 

225.99 229.61 B: i i think that's why we're now in afghanistan 

229.65 234.35 B: and um iraq because of those attacks don't you 

235.16 238.05 A: [sigh] yeah i think that there's a lot of 

238.68 240.83 A: miscommunication between 

240.98 243.89 A: officials and general public as to reasons to 

244.22 245.75 A: have been there 

245.81 250.65 A: from what it seems now versus when we first started going in there but but 

249.88 251.44 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] )) 

250.77 254.67 A: that was motivation behind being there in the first place [noise] 

254.11 255.02 B: right 

255.37 258.95 B: um i remember the first attack on iraq um 

259.35 263.32 B: the reasoning behind it was to get them out of kuwait 

264.02 267.24 B: um and that's all we did was 

267.41 269.02 B: liberate kuwait 

269.32 273.48 B: if we would've gone in and taken out the regime 

273.78 277.45 B: maybe we wouldn't be in a situation that we're in today 

277.98 281.04 B: um it's like fighting the battle twice 

282.15 283.29 B: what do you think 

285.60 286.21 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

287.23 295.66 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] i think that we could do a lot that would be positive and good in starting a new holiday for celebrating 

295.83 297.11 A: september eleventh 

297.22 298.29 A: overall 

298.25 306.31 B: i i i would love to see some kind of celebration i know the first anniversary was done very tasteful 

306.77 312.28 B: um i sat and watched every memorial i could on it and i cried 

313.15 314.00 B: um 

314.04 317.17 B: i just felt so proud to be an american that day 

317.44 318.43 A: (( [lipsmack] mhm [noise] )) 

318.32 321.95 B: to see those celebrations and people honored 

322.02 322.83 B: um 

323.06 327.60 B: so many volunteers firemen and policemen lost their lives trying to help others [noise] 

329.07 331.37 B: and that's something to be proud of 

332.40 335.12 B: people actually came to each other's aid 

335.43 337.64 B: without regard to their own lives 

339.09 340.68 B: and tha- and that's something 

340.87 345.68 B: americans have always fought for in the modern generation 

346.25 349.50 B: and i i just so feel so proud to be an american [noise] 

350.05 351.29 A: yeah 

352.30 355.65 B: um like the fourth of july is a big celebration for all of us 

356.08 364.40 B: and we tend to forget why we celebrate it but we just celebrate it i- it's a day of re- just being together proud to be an american [noise] 

360.30 361.12 A: (( [noise] )) 

367.51 370.52 A: [noise] what about you what would you create for a holiday 

367.52 368.65 B: i really 

370.42 371.38 B: um 

373.41 383.75 B: [noise] maybe a national day of mourning [noise] for so many other things that have [noise] happened as well just set aside a national day of [noise] mourning 

384.06 385.77 B: for prayer for everyone [noise] 

385.95 387.80 B: that would be my way of of 

388.32 393.85 B: creating a holiday [noise] and it wouldn't be any particular event it would just [noise] be 

394.06 398.48 B: to celeb- to reflect on everything we've struggled to get through 

399.07 400.30 B: (( what do you think )) 

403.40 404.37 B: (( [noise] )) 

403.79 405.66 A: (( mm [sigh] ))

412.05 413.21 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

413.09 416.43 A: ideas behind holidays generally tend to have them be 

415.12 420.89 B: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

416.58 420.94 A: more uplifting topics than mourning 

421.19 422.63 A: [laughter] 

422.36 431.10 B: well not mourning it's a celebration of life of what we've done for each other um 

431.38 432.70 B: reflection 

432.86 436.28 B: reflection means so much that passes on history 

436.44 441.65 B: that's how i see it um after serving so many years with the government 

441.77 445.81 B: it it's just a [noise] remembrance a day of remembrance
