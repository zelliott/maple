31.87 33.67 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

32.12 38.79 A: you know people are so worried about getting gifts anymore they don't forget the actual sentiment involved behind it

46.46 47.02 B: (( [mn] ))

70.58 73.12 A: about the wars you know not the people that are 

73.32 77.82 A: you know that everybody recognizes but the people that went over there did their job 

77.87 80.70 A: but [mn] had no recognition 

81.15 95.39 A: uh and just have them just be on something similar to the regular old veterans' day except maybe call it regular soldiers' day or something you know [laughter] but that's what's the veterans' day i guess is supposed to be about but it doesn't seem to be anymore does it 

91.71 93.39 B: [noise] yeah 

94.86 100.92 B: [noise] well i it it really depends on where on your area that you're from 

95.41 96.54 A: you know 

100.56 101.41 A: uh-huh 

101.33 107.89 B: i don't think until nine eleven i think veterans' day was starting to become a lost holiday 

107.97 110.33 A: yeah i think you're right it was 

108.14 109.02 B: (( but )) 

110.51 111.75 B: (( [noise] yeah ))

113.59 116.81 B: oh yeah yeah it's become the big thing 

117.16 126.38 A: uh yeah but how many people are doing it 'cause they want to or think it's necessary and how many people are doing it because they just wanna get on the bandwagon 

125.68 130.68 B: [noise] yeah but see i have a i have a two and a half year old 

130.41 132.08 A: yeah 

131.13 137.32 B: and we always had flags anyway because my dad is a veteran of the korean war 

132.40 133.74 A: (( i didn't want to take )) 

136.98 141.03 A: yeah yeah i know what that's like 

138.09 139.39 B: (( and uh )) 

139.84 144.31 B: (( [noise] [laughter] he uh was very )) 

144.85 148.14 B: adamant that we always put out flags for every holiday 

147.91 149.63 A: yeah 

148.19 148.93 B: (( you know )) 

149.60 158.10 B: veterans' day armistice day ve- uh memorial day flag day [laughter] 

156.19 160.62 A: i know all all all them good days th- that veterans consider good days 

160.46 161.40 B: yes 

161.04 175.96 A: yeah i i understand that you know um i'd i i don't know sometimes i think i'm guilty of not following through just as much as anybody else you know what i'm saying but at least i'm not you know like some of these dudes lately you know uh 

171.73 172.58 B: [noise] 

173.88 174.65 B: (( [cough] )) 

175.88 190.67 A: they're so worried about you know like this this war thing that we just had you know they were so darn worried about protesting the war that they're forgetting m- about the rest of the stuff you know the thing is is 

190.46 196.45 A: these you know you've gotta support 'em and one way you can support them i i guess is with these holiday things you know 

195.99 198.42 B: yeah [noise] 

196.83 201.03 A: 'cause uh you know like i say you know if you've got a got a holiday 

201.19 209.03 A: you know at least you you're being recognized you know for y- for your contributions to your own country for god's sakes you know 

204.62 205.75 B: (( [noise] and )) 

209.00 213.40 B: and it just it seems so strange to me that 

213.47 215.87 B: they would protest 

216.04 218.85 B: and then they would get upset if people 

219.34 222.33 B: were against them because of their protesting 

222.90 226.07 B: let's see where they have the right to protest 

225.21 232.22 A: that's isn't it isn't i don't i don't don't don't remember right but isn't that what the fourth of july is supposed to be about 

226.13 226.69 B: (( [mn] )) 

231.36 234.33 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

232.01 240.50 A: you know their right and my right and your right to be able to stand up in front of a crowd of people and say what we want 

240.15 247.10 B: right exactly yeah and if they have the right to protest i have the right to be upset because they protest 

241.41 242.45 A: you know 

246.16 249.46 A: you have a right to be a counter protest 

248.79 252.80 B: right exactly [laughter] 

249.66 251.55 A: [laughter] 

252.11 264.52 A: it's you oh you know it gets me these these dudes they're sitting there and they're saying oh jeeze you know this is wro- well maybe it is wrong you know i'm not i didn't agree with bush and the way he did things 

264.93 266.51 B: not totally but 

266.08 270.21 A: uh but the thing is is y- one one thing is 

267.84 269.66 B: you don't take it out 

270.25 275.86 A: is he's the president he's the one that has to make that decision i don't know enough about it to make that decision 

275.68 278.20 B: i don't want to know enough about it 

276.73 285.18 A: and i i you so you got that right who want to have to make a decision that's gonna send hundreds if not thousands of guys out to get killed 

285.33 286.69 B: (( yeah well )) 

285.64 297.38 A: and then and then like i say you know n- now they went over there and they've got all the problems associated with the war and we'll probably bring 'em back over here and they won't even be recognized as 

297.45 298.59 B: oh i don't 

297.67 299.45 A: decent individuals 

299.23 300.55 B: th- you know i 

299.49 306.73 A: except for us people that you know that care uh but most of the people would just ignore 'em 

306.08 312.90 B: here in this area in the kansas city area and i'm not for sure if it's because we have uh an 

315.01 316.22 A: i think 

315.41 318.54 B: airforce base here you know close by 

317.10 317.96 A: uh-huh 

318.64 322.61 B: we have lightning where the uh stealth bombers take off

326.72 329.21 B: yeah [laughter] 

330.75 342.01 A: nah i understand you guys you guys are probably more have have more recognition in that area see i'm from down here in north central arkansas where the only thing we have basically 

331.01 331.91 B: but 

340.48 341.37 B: (( oh )) 

341.92 355.61 A: uh see we used to have a base at blytheville but it's gone now he was strategic air command base the only base we've got in arkansas now is a fighter base down there in uh little rock and it's basically just for 

347.29 348.34 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

355.92 358.59 A: er uh reserves now 

358.64 359.63 B: (( right [noise] )) 

359.21 367.31 A: you know so we you know the only thing we have is the veterans of foreign wars and the recognitions that they get you know for the various um 

368.46 371.89 A: you know the vari- the various things that the veterans get 

371.61 374.20 B: and you know i i will agree with you 

371.69 384.85 A: you know because nobody's willing to you know nobody's willing to come forward and say hey let's recognize these dudes that just got called up last month at our local national guard and got called in to go to war 

374.28 375.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

384.75 398.55 A: you know maybe they're over there in the middle east and yet those guys will come back and they some of them won't even get their jobs back and some of them you know there are the people down the road who have to say oh you shouldn't have gone 'cause you you you know why you know

483.64 488.83 A: much like this go thing going on it's not really a declared war 

488.92 496.76 A: but yet that's the only kind of wars we're gonna get any more is you know why shouldn't these guys that go fight be recognized 

496.95 499.06 B: [noise] exactly 

497.59 502.23 A: you know if if nothing else let's give 'em their own holiday for god's sakes

553.58 554.36 B: right 

553.71 561.07 A: and what do their family get out of it well yeah they get an american flag whoopee that's not a whole lot of consideration 

561.01 570.23 A: for a mother that raised her kid to eighteen years and maybe he got married and had his own little child and now his child's not gonna see him the rest of its life 

570.40 576.97 A: you know that's not you know five thousand [mn] bucks in cash and a flag just doesn't seem to be 

577.18 582.87 A: right you know they need to recognize at least his contributions to the country 

577.57 578.45 B: well 

582.21 587.84 B: one of my friends her son was killed in the pentagon the day of the attack
