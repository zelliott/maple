34.07 35.42 A: i think 

35.54 37.55 A: um they need to 

37.76 41.86 A: i think disarming iraq was probably one of the best things that they could've done 

41.44 42.46 B: (( uh-hum )) 

42.21 44.35 A: 'cause there there just seemed to be 

44.46 46.88 A: ah ah such argument over

69.22 78.81 B: sometimes we do things that we really don't want to do [mn] um and like you said it you know this was something that probably just really needed to be done 

78.71 87.03 B: even though you know we didn't lose a whole lot of lives well we lost definitely enough lives you know 

85.70 88.51 A: oh definitely one life was enough life [laughter] [noise] 

87.96 93.75 B: yes we have definitely lost enough lives [sigh] so um 

93.66 106.31 B: [lipsmack] oh if you know it's just a hard thing you know all round hard for you know even though we would come out on top with the victory there's still 

106.34 113.29 B: you know you look back and you look at the ashes you look back and you you know you may know somebody that 

113.22 122.97 B: even if they have not lost their lives you may know somebody i personally know a few people that had to you know just go over there you know and and um 

120.51 121.39 A: yes 

123.40 134.62 B: i just don't know what impact that would have on them for the rest of their lives even though they may not been in have been in the main stream of everything that was going over 

134.53 147.03 B: on in iraq but still um you know you just 'cause we're not there we're sitting at home we're in our houses we're comfortable you know and and we can watch

156.60 159.08 B: you know what it looks like to us 

159.39 173.08 B: is par- i'm sure it you know it's totally totally different than what they are facing and what they see and how they feel and [lipsmack] you know it's just like you know my heart goes out to them 

162.04 163.46 A: (( it's only a fraction )) 

172.81 173.64 A: (( right yes )) 

173.04 179.45 B: you know even though we may come back as victors you know but still it's like

199.50 208.50 B: right that is true that is true and you know like you said again this is just something that had to be done because 

208.51 217.08 B: i mean if we didn't if we kept stalling and we didn't do anything about it you know ha who knows what would happen next 

216.69 222.09 A: so [noise] well that's right i mean if you were in president bush's shoes i mean what would you have done

231.37 232.13 B: uh-huh 

235.57 236.44 B: right 

236.15 241.15 A: and i mean [sigh] president bush walked in during nine eleven for crying out loud
