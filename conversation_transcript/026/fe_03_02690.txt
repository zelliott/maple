42.46 44.48 B: [laughter] 

47.18 53.96 B: [noise] yeah i i do too but i think a lot of holidays like they take the religious aspect out of it [mn] 

53.37 56.46 A: [noise] oh yeah that that's true too 

56.17 62.21 B: i mean not that i'm highly religious but i think you know christmas is when jesus was born and 

61.51 62.46 A: (( right [noise] )) 

63.13 73.47 B: and people tend to focus on christmas trees and reindeers and santa claus and which is fine for children but i think they should be taught both ways 

66.53 67.68 A: mhm 

72.89 74.38 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

75.33 77.12 A: [laughter] [noise] that's true too

102.17 104.92 B: we do all the other commercialized stuff 

106.31 111.27 B: so what was the other question if you could create a holiday what would it be and why don't think

278.35 281.25 B: i find it's hard to shop for men though 

281.22 286.67 A: [noise] yeah that is because my friend [noise] my male friend he just has 

286.96 287.87 A: everything 

288.88 291.22 A: [noise] so it's hard to shop for him [noise] [noise] 

290.65 295.16 B: and and men aren't like women that like women will appreciate anything 

294.79 297.80 A: mhm and men they're like ew 

295.39 296.85 B: clothing 

297.06 297.90 B: [laughter] 

298.35 300.21 A: they'll give you that look like eew 

300.21 306.70 B: an- and they wear the same thing all the time so it's like you can buy them a shirt and tie and they'll just tuck it away and wear the same thing 

301.32 302.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

305.60 307.43 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

307.54 310.24 B: women women it's easier to shop for 

309.99 311.55 A: (( [laughter] [noise] right )) 

312.10 313.36 A: [noise] that's true 

314.64 317.49 A: (( [lipsmack] 'cause we're more appreciative [noise] )) 

316.88 317.97 B: yeah 

317.96 319.29 A: (( [laughter] )) 

318.70 321.43 B: well that is true because my husband he's like 

321.53 324.63 B: no matter what you give him it's never enough 

324.40 326.26 A: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise] )) 

324.74 327.63 B: or it's not what he expected or wanted 

327.33 329.16 A: mhm 

329.65 337.45 A: so i just give i just give my boyfriend i usually just give him a um a gift certificate somewhere to his like his favorite store [noise] 

335.58 337.50 B: [lipsmack] that's a good idea 

337.96 339.96 A: (( [laughter] [noise] so he can go get it himself [laughter] )) 

340.49 343.14 A: and if he doesn't like it he can just blame it on himself 

343.87 345.25 B: that's a good idea 

344.95 346.60 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

345.75 347.55 B: i should start doing that 

347.19 348.59 A: (( [noise] [laughter] [noise] )) 

348.05 351.62 B: but then if i do he'll probably say well i don't like that store 

351.53 352.42 A: why 

351.76 353.47 B: [laughter] 

352.94 357.09 A: [noise] it's not my fault well see i know most of the stores he shop at so if 

358.08 360.30 B: oh that's good that's good 

358.10 359.93 A: (( i just get him a [mn] so )) 

360.30 362.32 A: (( i just give him a certificate )) 

363.02 364.74 A: and [noise] everything will be fine 

363.11 363.82 B: i 

364.94 366.18 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

366.66 369.31 B: [mn] that's a good idea i'll have to try that 

369.68 371.07 A: (( [noise] )) 

370.50 374.32 B: i don't know i think these holidays sometimes they're blown out of proportion 

374.86 375.78 A: yeah 

376.38 380.14 B: you know even in church because we went to church for easter 

376.79 377.75 A: (( [noise] they are [noise] )) 

380.25 385.04 B: and uh we went to a catholic church i grew up protestant you know in a baptist church 

382.13 386.13 A: [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] mhm 

385.41 391.21 B: and even the priest was talking to the kids about easter bunnies which i felt was really strange 

390.84 391.90 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

393.08 397.26 B: i think you know people need to bring back the true meaning of holidays and 

395.78 397.66 A: [noise] right 

397.45 399.99 B: stop commercializing everything 

400.16 401.28 A: mhm 

402.01 404.33 A: which is true [noise] 

404.57 406.42 B: (( you know and celebrate like )) 

407.51 414.63 B: if they have president's day and labor day and memorial day and people just look at that like a day off they don't 

414.77 415.62 A: right 

414.82 422.83 B: look at the meaning of martin luther king day people don't know the history behind these days they just oh we have a day off 

424.15 425.24 A: (( [noise] [noise] that's true )) 

424.79 427.33 B: yeah i think that that should be looked into too 

429.59 431.54 A: (( [noise] everything is so commercialized ))
