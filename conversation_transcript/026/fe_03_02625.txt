3.13 6.01 B: [noise] ah hi there ah this is dean 

5.37 10.03 A: [noise] hi dean how're you doing this evening have you done one of these before 

7.02 8.43 B: i'm fine [noise] 

9.42 11.11 B: no first one how 'bout you [laughter] 

10.24 13.81 A: oh okay well i got one one other one in earlier today so [sigh] 

13.42 14.27 B: oh 

14.39 18.77 A: [noise] just an interesting little thing but ah let's start talking about 

19.09 20.27 A: iraq [sigh] [noise] 

19.90 22.52 B: okay well like what's the first part of the question again 

21.73 23.18 A: (( [sigh] um )) 

23.66 35.83 A: should ah what well i think [laughter] very open ah ended it was what should the u._s. do about iraq [sigh] ah should disarmament be a major focus of the u._s. effort something to that effect 

35.28 38.32 B: ah interesting what do you think [noise] 

37.65 44.31 A: [noise] [lipsmack] well i guess i mean one is i would say part of th- i think part of the premise is a little off in that um [sigh] 

44.95 47.12 A: if you'd asked me you know a month ago 

47.05 57.38 A: [laughter] about or two months ago about disarming iraq okay that's that's a debate but the fact is we have invaded it and basically possessed the country so disarming is kind of ah 

57.34 71.93 A: part of the game [laughter] now we own it so we've gotta we've gotta deal with the disarming ah part of it whether we whether we had business going in there or not in the first place it still [sigh] it's we got it [sigh] and so we got to do something with it 

70.50 71.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

71.65 77.05 B: yeah i guess i i have to agree with that um 

77.13 79.44 B: yeah i wasn't [lipsmack] i don't know 

79.77 83.55 B: ah the u._s. is like always like messing round with other countries [laughter] 

82.37 84.98 A: [noise] [sigh] yeah i mean it it's 

85.07 89.73 A: it's kind of a notorious thing big countries powerful countries have this tendency 

90.12 94.38 A: and if they don't they're accused of being isolationists 

94.33 95.48 B: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

94.89 102.11 A: [sigh] um so it's when you're with are the big boy you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't 

102.30 112.45 B: yeah i just think they should well i think they should kinda take care of u._s. should take care of its own people a little bit more and [mn] 

102.40 103.86 A: (( ah [sigh] [noise] )) 

110.84 120.97 A: yeah as i said it's a hard balance i mean in and you'll never make everybody happy when you're trying i mean 'cause 'cause you have too many constituencies that have too many different ideas 

121.04 125.04 A: and the constituencies are maybe by their nature vocal [mn] 

125.49 133.41 A: you know um it's like it's which is which is more important foreign affairs or domestic affairs well [sigh] [mn] 

132.56 134.76 B: [laughter] i'd say domestic affairs [laughter] 

134.76 145.92 A: yeah but how much more important and what should that you know wh- where should the energy go and what should it be i mean it it becomes an intellectual exercise i think as much as anything 

137.39 138.08 B: (( we- )) 

145.48 154.77 B: ah i just think well whenever the the oh i don't know the u._s. whenever they get the all these wars and stuff it's like a ton of money they spend [mn] 

154.02 158.77 A: [noise] [mn] yeah i mean yeah and i think wars wars are definitely the last 

158.89 159.97 A: um 

160.28 162.25 A: [lipsmack] last bastion and i've been 

162.33 165.43 A: ah definitely surprised about how 

165.91 173.58 A: the last couple of military efforts have gone ah and from at least from a military standpoint how smooth they've been [sigh] um 

172.73 173.56 B: (( [noise] mm huh )) 

173.75 182.54 A: and the fact [laughter] th- that ah people have had ah to obsess about how poorly things are going in the middle of it wh- when the reality was it was only a day or two 

183.03 184.17 A: (( of ah )) 

184.21 189.17 A: less i'm don't say smooth sailing but less than smooth sailing at some level but ah 

189.19 194.72 A: so i guess let me ask you this dean what do y- what do you think we should do as far as the government of iraq 

194.92 196.62 B: (( the government well yo- )) 

195.90 201.69 A: yeah i mean here you have a country with no government that hasn't had a government in thirty years other than the one 

199.35 199.92 B: (( [mn] )) 

201.63 210.08 B: i think um first of all i think you're [laughter] right it's like well we've invaded and w- and now we own them and yeah we should ah 

210.39 213.75 B: might as well do whatever the heck we want disarming or whatever 

212.08 212.64 A: (( [noise] )) 

212.78 213.34 A: (( [mn] )) 

213.50 222.77 A: [noise] well on- only what you what kinda of i mean how involved should we be in setting up the government should it basically be what we want it to be or 

213.88 215.01 B: (( [noise] )) 

222.68 229.05 A: how much say should we give to the iraqi people in setting up the government 

227.76 230.61 B: well as far as i see it most likely it's going to be [sigh] 

230.93 245.54 B: from the past history of how the united states dealt with these kind of things most likely it's going to be the people over there running it but ah they'll be heavily influenced by the way united states want it run like like a democracy so yeah i guess that's the way to go [noise] mm 

237.10 238.70 A: yeah 

241.35 242.97 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

244.95 247.37 A: [mn] [lipsmack] well i mean wd- would and one of the real 

247.59 261.13 A: issues is gonna be that ah at least right now i a very high percentage of the people will probably opt for a religious government which is exactly what the u._s. doesn't want because they're afraid that'll mirror iran 

261.26 268.05 A: ah and um kind of bring up those problems so ho- i mean how do you think the u._s. should handle that [sigh] [noise] 

270.22 271.92 B: (( kind of )) 

271.00 280.04 A: kind of a danger of giving anybody it's like okay now you've given them the right to vote okay [laughter] now [laughter] this is what the majority says what are you you going to live up to that 

278.49 279.28 B: (( dangerous )) 

279.47 281.59 B: [cough] oh i think it's still gonna be 

282.66 289.15 B: i don't know i still think it's gonna be it's gonna be kinda like a mixture of what the what the u._s. ideas are and what ah 

287.14 288.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

289.06 298.11 B: iraq's idea of ah you know how they want to live the way they want to be governed something like that that's the way i figure it's gonna be as far as i mean they 

294.72 296.06 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

298.49 307.16 B: i mean it is those people over there and we are over here so the u._s. unless they unless the u._s. sends a like a lot of like i don't know politicians or whoever 

307.23 312.33 B: you know to really run the place which i doubt they will do then it's going to pretty much be run 

307.96 310.39 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

312.43 320.12 B: it's gonna be it's gonna kind of be like um [cough] the u._s.'s going to be like the big like the big i guess the big mother hen or whatever 

319.69 321.55 A: yeah 

320.12 327.65 B: and their government whoever it is is gonna is gonna be like a kid [laughter] they're going to be like supervised but their running i- 

325.70 327.37 A: yeah 

327.77 332.03 B: it's gonna be like a mix that's most likely things going to be it's not going to be 

332.51 338.99 B: i doubt it's going to be all that re- really like fanatical religion but if [laughter] it is then it's gonna 

339.08 342.25 B: the future of the thing is going to happen again i think [noise] 

339.38 340.64 A: (( [noise] )) 

340.79 351.28 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah i mean i i i think that there's there's a strong possibility the shias who are a majority [noise] of the people in iraq 

351.39 361.06 A: [mn] have been the less dominant political force in iraq the sunnis have been more dominant politically but lower in number 

361.35 368.30 A: and the shias tend to tend to be more fundamentalist and want a very strong religious basis 

368.53 376.76 A: for the government and so i think they're going to try to um directly or indirectly really have a strong influence 

376.39 378.96 B: yeah i agree they probably will [noise] 

376.94 382.80 A: ah and because i think the only people really the only government right now in iraq is in the mosque 

382.71 392.91 A: it's the imams who have more power than anybody right now other than the u._s. and they have the power of the gun but [sigh] and so i think it's gonna be the ah the the imams who are going to be the ones [sigh] 

392.98 400.90 A: who shape things and they they tend to be very fundamentalist and tend to have a strong influence on the people to get them to go in the direction they want 'em to go 

401.44 404.33 B: yeah i think pretty much it's gonna 

404.42 408.98 B: [lipsmack] what i think it's it's probably going to be as heavily influenced by those people their religion 

408.75 410.38 A: yeah 

409.16 423.44 B: but if the u._s. is going to try to make it ah a democracy that's ah i guess what the u._s. really can do unless they really want like changes to the uni- [laughter] part of it changes like you know puerto rico is like part of the united states that kind of thing 

412.64 413.57 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

423.01 429.66 A: yeah yeah well we don't need we don't need territories [sigh] common rules yeah 

423.43 425.50 B: but i don't see that happening 

426.35 428.42 B: (( well i don't see that happening though )) 

428.70 435.85 B: i think the u._s. [laughter] in some ways are more interested in controlling um probably the oil that's what i think 

434.34 435.90 A: [sigh] yeah mm 

436.01 437.11 B: so 

437.02 444.94 A: so i mean that's why i that's why we were there in the first place i mean the middle the m- if if it weren't for the oil the middle east would simply be part of africa [sigh] 

444.82 452.60 A: you know in the u._s. mind set it's just okay these countries just can't get along and [sigh] they're gonna f- fight some but we really don't care 

452.67 466.08 A: you know b- but kuwait [laughter] and i know some kuwaitis it it was not a country we necessarily needed to [laughter] go worrying about defending yes iraq did a bad thing invading it years ago but the kuwaitis are not [sigh] ah the nicest people in the world 

466.58 471.08 A: [sigh] maybe 'cause they had so much money ah especially in the the oil rich days of the eighties 

472.34 475.66 A: [sigh] they were a pretty rich bunch [sigh] now let me ask you dean do ah 

475.77 484.96 A: is there much discussion you know at work or school about [sigh] iraq i'm i'm working at home mostly so i don't get this the kinda discussion but are people talking about it in the office 

485.11 486.40 B: uh-huh 

487.09 488.45 B: (( ah well )) 

489.05 494.28 B: not really [laughter] i i'm in here in los angeles california so it's 

492.42 493.36 A: [sigh] oh okay 

493.59 495.33 A: yeah 

494.47 507.17 B: it's really not really people don't really talk too much about it i mean i mean yeah well there i guess there is some talk like ah socially like ah where i work and that like you know at ah 

503.51 505.15 A: yeah 

507.35 517.98 B: parties and that people will talk about it and they'll kind of debate about it but for the most part people are pretty i don't know they're not that concerned over here about it in a way 

516.50 523.34 A: [lipsmack] well [noise] i mean it gets into politics and i guess politics becomes contentious and unless you live in washington d._c. you just don't live by politics much 

523.30 528.71 B: [cough] right [laughter] now so do you just get all your information from the t._v. [laughter] and radio 

527.38 532.21 A: [noise] um mostly the radio ah i listen to n._p._r. a lot and ah 

529.02 530.17 B: (( oh do you )) 

532.18 539.41 A: [sigh] i'm in i'm in the boston area so we have we have a lot of there's some discussion about it and you see you hear lots of protests and bumper stickers ah 

539.33 543.99 A: [sigh] that kind of stuff um but you you you kind of you you balance it all 

543.89 555.04 A: um but i was just kind of curious in the workplace i i think i'm assuming there was a lot more discussion when the war itself was on when that reality t._v. show we call the war in iraq was going 

554.35 555.62 B: oh yes 

555.04 564.96 A: [mn] um but that was it it's funny 'cause i'm i have a military background so i you know i i'm you know i haven't lived quite at that level [laughter] but i've a better understanding [sigh] um 

564.94 572.17 A: that was riveting and i think a lot of discussion but it was about you know something real and about real people and it didn't matter 

572.87 587.71 A: the politics of it you know it was happening [sigh] but i think the politics of it make it much more once i- once we're getting to this phase it's the part america hates as a country [sigh] we like to go we like to win the game but we don't like to clean up afterwards 

587.68 599.95 A: [sigh] and we don't like the we don't like messy situations you know where we don't understand i mean we're still we've got a pretty big mess in afghanistan from everything i've been hearing lately [sigh] supported the wrong war lords and [sigh] 

587.91 589.43 B: (( [noise] yeah ))
