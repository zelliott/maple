148.46 155.89 A: see i i know we're supposed to be talking about what we can do in other places but i really think they have to focus on here first [laughter] 

155.14 156.42 B: (( know )) 

158.03 158.78 A: (( [noise] )) 

159.39 160.21 A: hm

167.82 168.72 B: (( so )) 

169.18 179.79 A: well i also think some of the people there are waiting for us to pick up the pieces and i don't think they quite understand that they're not under dictatorship any more we're not gonna tell them what to do 

179.88 183.26 A: they have to work to fix their own future 

184.15 186.32 A: now and kinda tell us what 

186.58 189.23 A: they want and maybe we can give them an idea 

188.74 190.32 B: (( [noise] right )) 

189.35 196.73 A: or steer 'em in the right direction but we can't do it for them then we're just gonna be like dictators over them maybe not abusing them but still 

197.69 199.53 A: not giving them the freedom 

200.39 202.62 A: which is supposed to be what we helped end 

202.98 213.04 B: yeah those those people yeah they they they weren't allowed to do anything for themselves you know they were even afraid to go outside a lot 

213.51 218.93 A: well they've gotta take a chance and learn and experience it 

216.84 220.71 B: i don't really think they know how to take care of themselves now 

221.40 222.34 A: some 

221.60 223.61 B: or else they're afraid 

224.75 232.11 A: i'm sure they are but our country had roots where we had people that didn't know what to do and they had to be willing to stick their necks out 

232.27 234.96 A: to build the type of world we have now [laughter] 

237.07 246.06 A: and some of those areas are developed 'cause they showed the inside of some of the stores and things and they look comparative to what we have i mean i know a lot of it's not like that but 

246.03 252.10 B: [noise] the buildings are beautiful that's a beautiful city baghdad beautiful 

250.62 251.63 A: and i know 

252.15 255.71 A: they have a rich culture so they definitely have things to 

252.20 252.87 B: (( [noise] )) 

256.13 257.82 A: base things on 

258.62 267.06 A: and like their own people getting up and looting their museums and things and destroying them in retaliation was not cool 'cause all they're doing is hurting their own history 

263.96 265.18 B: (( yeah )) 

266.63 268.09 B: (( you're right )) 

267.38 274.20 A: and taking it from their own children and future generations who maybe won't get a chance to see it 

274.56 276.89 B: (( [noise] )) 

275.40 280.32 A: but we can real- we can't be responsible to protect that 'cause [laughter] 

280.93 285.08 A: (( you know that would that would just end by people reacting badly )) 

285.00 286.13 B: (( yeah )) 

285.18 287.92 A: sort of like riots used to happen here 

289.14 292.82 A: more more before i was born but like in the sixties and stuff 

292.43 293.34 B: mhm

297.08 305.72 A: i can't remember that 'cause i wasn't born yet but i've seen footage and stuff on it and there was a lot of civil unrest here too at points when things changed

324.55 325.56 B: uh-huh 

334.21 337.59 A: so i didn't really realize it until people started 

338.33 348.67 A: coming back that were on their way to work in manhattan and saying that the trains and stuff were being stopped 'cause at that point i had changed to a bus and the buses in queens weren't affected 

347.86 348.98 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

348.86 352.82 A: and then i got to work and found out [laughter] 

352.94 353.69 B: (( mm ))

396.83 406.01 A: yeah we can't do all of it though i mean they have to be willing to pitch in i can see like having people say hey this is a plan what do you people think okay 

399.26 400.34 B: no 

405.94 419.68 A: you know we have three of our guys to help show you this get a hundred of your people let's work together [laughter] we'll show you how to you know build a proper system for this or how to clean this up or 

409.46 411.07 B: [noise]

425.69 428.23 A: we can't be the fixers of everything 

425.97 426.74 B: (( [laughter] mm ))

438.89 442.95 B: i don't know how our country's ever gonna recover financially from this 

444.34 448.18 B: people have to pay uh [laughter] taxes 

447.51 453.74 A: [laughter] that's what they'll do they'll raise the taxes but since unemployment's high 

453.78 457.63 A: it's not much of a

465.75 476.50 A: the buildings here our city's really messed up budget wise so they're trying to balance the budget by closing other things and by and they just laid off a slew of city employees 

477.08 477.77 B: hm 

477.51 481.99 A: which doesn't help because then all those families are gonna have to go on assistance 

482.03 488.80 A: and they're gonna have to probably go on medical care which is just more money coming out of the government just from a different pocket 

496.75 500.33 B: (( yeah [noise] ))
