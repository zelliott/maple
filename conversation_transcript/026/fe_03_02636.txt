0.21 2.14 B: (( [mn] hello [sigh] )) 

2.03 3.48 A: ah hi 

3.03 4.41 B: this is dick 

4.16 6.06 A: hi dick this is ryan 

5.77 7.07 B: (( [sigh] ryan )) 

6.63 7.78 A: yes 

7.70 10.86 B: yes i guess our topic is 

11.03 14.26 B: should we disarm iraq or not 

12.60 17.44 A: [laughter] seems like sort of ah a moot question at this point [laughter] 

17.06 21.92 B: well they have weapons but i don't think they have weapons of mass destruction 

21.32 22.85 A: you don't think they do 

22.67 23.97 B: (( no i don't [sigh] )) 

24.59 26.76 B: they never found any anyway 

26.86 29.02 A: yeah i just i guess i 

29.07 35.90 A: i still i still harbour th- the belief that they're that they're there somewhere and while 

35.94 40.38 A: we haven't found them yet i'm sure that now that we're in the active pitching phase 

38.16 42.14 B: [sigh] well i think the only way they're gonna be there is if we plant 'em there 

42.23 44.45 A: you think that we would plant them there 

44.35 47.40 B: we have to do something to justify ourself 

47.18 50.53 A: so you don't think we were justified going over there in the first place 

50.32 53.01 B: not for weapons of mass destruction 

54.33 58.75 B: [sigh] nobody's ever found any over there in the in the last recent years 

54.60 55.34 A: be 

62.22 71.03 A: and [sigh] well i i i know they've certainly found evidence th- that or certainly iraq has not produced any that they've 

68.72 72.83 B: [sigh] they had 'em fifteen years ago yeah [noise] 

71.51 79.11 A: right yeah they had 'em back then and they haven't produced any evidence to show that that they got rid of them so i guess the assumption is that they 

79.09 91.29 A: that they still have 'em there but you're right they certainly haven't come up with the smoking gun per se that i think a lot of people have been [sigh] waiting and waiting and waiting for them to come up with they've found [sigh] you know it almost seems like every time they find 

85.71 86.28 B: (( [noise] )) 

91.35 104.32 A: you know you hear on the news that they find something that may be something that may be and then it turns out that it's not so i can certainly understand why there are a lot of people who are saying okay [laughter] that's why we went over there how come you haven't found any yet [noise] 

96.11 97.08 B: yeah 

104.68 109.85 B: [sigh] well that was a moot question right now we've already conquered 'em [sigh] [noise] 

109.91 116.87 A: yeah that's true and i i know a- another question that i've her- heard come up is whether or not now 

116.85 129.40 A: that that we're there if we should be the ones who are continuing the search or the u._n. should be [sigh] allowed ta to come in and continue the search for that what do you what do you think about that or do you think since 

129.17 134.07 A: since you don't think they're there anyway i guess it's [laughter] sort of a a [laughter] moot point that way too 

133.69 139.11 B: (( [sigh] i don't care who does it when they look for ma- weapons of mass destruction i don't care who does it [noise] )) 

139.02 141.93 A: (( [sigh] do you think that ah a- )) 

141.97 148.56 A: based on the the initial reaction and some of the subsequent reaction of of the iraqi people 

148.37 158.52 A: celebrating in the streets welcoming the united states knocking over the statue of saddam that that was a good enough reason to go in there ta to liberate them from from 

151.23 152.33 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] )) 

157.89 161.42 B: that would not have been a justifiable reason to start with 

161.30 162.73 A: you don't think so 

162.69 165.91 B: just to go in to throw saddam out 

165.31 166.61 A: yeah 

166.57 171.35 B: [sigh] what about syria where they got a [noise] damn a despot 

170.87 172.72 A: (( [laughter] ye- )) 

171.93 174.62 B: are we going to go in there and throw him out too 

173.87 182.67 A: it is it is kind of interesting where we we ah pick our dictators that we like and pick the ones that we don't like ah kind of strangely because they do 

180.89 181.67 B: right 

182.51 194.40 A: much the same stuff in syria they do much the same stuff in north korea they do much the same stuff in in china yet somehow it it's [laughter] this country that we've gone in to do it so you you make a good point [sigh] 

189.79 190.35 B: (( [cough] )) 

192.36 193.42 B: right 

195.84 200.65 B: [sigh] i was for peace but ah i i back the military 

200.07 201.03 A: right 

201.25 206.07 B: [mn] [sigh] i'll back the military but i'm not going to back the politics of 'em 

205.47 207.70 A: yeah well i guess [sigh] 

207.63 214.13 A: i guess i'm i'm m- more along the lines of of after e- especially after hearing 

214.05 224.08 A: th- the terrible and awful things that that he did to the people of his country there and the way that he ruled them so mercilessly it certainly make sense that he's gone but [sigh] 

223.99 231.70 A: i think the people who raise the question then why don't you take care of dictators everywhere certainly have a valid point although 

232.06 234.39 A: [cough] i don't know it seems like 

234.54 241.52 A: with some of the other nations e- even though they they rule with an iron fist there is a little bit [mn] 

241.94 246.51 A: i guess a little bit more of the regular diplomacy when they're dealing with the united states 

245.53 249.50 B: that's what they said about syria they said syria is a 

249.91 251.09 B: is a 

251.64 253.93 B: dictatorship 

253.36 255.76 A: (( i guess that [laughter] )) 

254.16 255.51 B: (( but ah )) 

255.73 259.07 B: they say that that's more more of a 

261.01 262.18 B: um 

263.03 268.74 B: um ah now how should i put it that's more of a um 

269.56 273.02 B: (( p._g. type thing compared to iran )) 

272.56 284.86 A: oh [laughter] that's that's an excellent way to put it an excellent way to put it they're different dic- i guess there are nice dictators and there are mean dictators and because we go after the mean dictators an- and leave the nice dictators alone [sigh] 

279.98 281.05 B: right 

284.21 285.68 B: right 

285.01 298.12 A: do you have any concern that that now that we've gotten ourselves into iraq an- and started looking there an and have have already mentioned that we're unhappy with 

292.07 292.95 B: [sigh] 

298.22 306.57 A: with what syria is doing and that we think that they have some weapons of mass destruction or at least were helping iraq with theirs or helping them get rid of theirs 

306.52 315.43 A: do you have any concerns that we're just gonna keep on rolling and say okay what country is next and just just ah keep getting our country to 

313.73 317.89 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] i don't know what's gonna happen i tell ya i really don't )) 

319.06 321.67 B: i really don't know what's gonna happen 

322.42 324.78 A: [cough] well it it it certainly 

325.38 332.64 B: [sigh] [noise] i think we have more concerns with our economy than we have with these d- dictators 

325.39 327.57 A: it certainly is potentially a 

329.59 330.62 A: [laughter] 

332.42 335.41 A: that's that's very true it it certainly 

334.85 340.83 B: now they they ignored this north korean thing and now that's a nuclear country 

342.10 346.69 B: (( who knows maybe they'll drop an atomic bomb on san francisco or so )) 

346.14 349.38 A: (( [lipsmack] uh-huh uh-hum [laughter] wow [laughter] )) 

349.45 351.65 A: that would that would not be good [laughter] 

351.78 359.08 B: [sigh] oh well i wouldn't that's something they probably would do um they're they're really crazy there they're almost as crazy as bush 

359.19 365.38 A: [laughter] you think bush is that crazy i i take it you didn't vote for him in the last election 

364.92 367.45 B: i voted for him i supported him 

366.85 368.08 A: really 

367.69 369.44 B: i was for him 

368.83 370.82 A: yeah wow 

369.52 374.33 B: [sigh] but ah he's come on here like um hitler or something 

374.43 377.50 B: it's like he's lost his mind 

376.82 378.07 A: wow 

377.99 379.80 B: i think anyway 

379.48 384.28 A: do you think that that's just that's just recently that ah i mean just 

382.66 386.32 B: just in the last year or so yeah after afghanistan 

384.39 385.72 A: w- with his 

385.75 388.21 A: after september eleventh almost 

387.62 392.10 B: no after afghanistan afghanistan made sense to me because 

389.34 390.44 A: ah 

391.48 392.46 A: uh-huh 

392.22 396.73 B: this iraq thing doesn't make any sense but i i support the military 

396.39 397.68 A: right 

397.17 400.06 B: but i don't support the politics of it [noise] 

399.11 405.54 A: [sigh] do you find that's hard when you have conversations with people in trying to make that distinction where 

405.82 410.84 A: [cough] you know you're you're trying to say that you don't support the reason that that you're there but 

410.74 414.92 A: you do support all the people who are there it's very easy for someone 

414.70 427.32 A: who doesn't understand your position to just label you as unpatriotic and how could you do that how could you think that you're hurting our efforts [sigh] do you find that i- is that something that you that you've run into when you've talked about this issue with other people 

427.08 429.65 B: [sigh] i don't talk about it usually 

428.90 430.22 A: [laughter] 

429.82 430.38 B: (( [sigh] )) 

431.31 433.61 B: no i supported the military 

433.01 434.03 A: uh-huh 

435.25 444.35 B: and once it was started i was supporting the military in my mind i would talk about that i want the army navy airforce marines 

440.96 441.90 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

444.92 450.18 B: ah whoever's involved that way to do well and now ah 

447.96 449.11 A: yeah 

450.32 451.99 B: do a good job 

452.33 456.85 B: [sigh] but to get involved with the politics and that is crazy 

456.70 463.13 A: [sigh] i guess they've [sigh] they've got to follow the orders regardless of wh- whether [laughter] they like 'em or not 

459.95 461.02 B: of the 

462.64 467.04 B: right so that that that they're not they're not nuts 

470.76 472.67 A: yeah it's it's 

472.73 485.12 A: i i i thought it was interesting that it was what just yesterday that bush came on and did his national address and you know basically kind of said well the war's over and it seems to me like there is [sigh] 

485.23 496.65 A: there's still a lot of fighting yet to be done not necessarily i guess the m- military fighting but they've got a lot of work to do there if they're going to win over you know the hearts and minds of a lot of the iraqi people 

493.90 507.35 B: [sigh] i'm i'm a sort of clinton supporter i think that ah he's right [sigh] instead of rebuilding iraq we ought to be concerned about our own country re- rebuilding our own country our schools are are needing help 

504.36 505.29 A: right 

507.21 508.14 A: (( right [noise] )) 

509.03 510.95 A: (( that's yeah ah [noise] )) 

510.07 512.96 B: why are we spending all this money on iraq 

513.55 518.21 B: [sigh] how many billions are they talking about a hundred billion to s- rebuild iraq 

517.87 519.90 A: i don't know if it's that much but it's 

518.59 522.74 B: or two billion a week or two billion a day or something 

522.39 525.08 A: i i don't think it's that much a day but it's 

524.11 526.24 B: (( it's two billion a week maybe [noise] [noise] )) 

525.58 540.48 A: yeah it's definitely a a big chunk a change and it's certainly a good argument that my gosh that could there are there are hundreds of thousands of people who are out of work here in the u._s. or who go to schools where the buildings are falling down and [sigh] and and [sigh] 

540.95 544.48 A: why don't they deserve [laughter] a little chunk of that before 

544.55 547.15 A: before it goes off being spent somewhere else 

547.06 547.62 B: (( [cough] )) 

548.40 551.42 B: (( i don't think he's going to be reelected to tell you the truth )) 

550.85 551.96 A: really 

552.16 554.38 A: boy he's got high approval ratings 

554.65 558.27 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] i don't i don't think the people will vote for him )) 

555.11 555.87 A: (( i mean )) 

557.59 558.81 A: really 

558.79 563.22 B: if they want the if they want the economy to continue the way it is [sigh] 

563.38 566.70 A: do you think that will be the the deciding factor [noise] yeah 

565.97 570.30 B: definitely we're concerned about our own selves we're not concerned about iraq 

570.79 581.03 A: i guess what was the slogan that they used in the what was it the nineteen ninety two election with ah with clinton and the other bush it's the economy stupid [laughter] [laughter] it still is [sigh] 

577.98 579.17 B: (( yeah of )) 

580.31 589.93 B: course it depends on who the democratic re- candidate is if they don't have a candidate that can do it [sigh] i imagine i'm just going to stay out of it and 

589.26 590.35 A: really 

590.33 593.97 B: i'll vote for whoever i don't know 

595.21 599.89 B: but ah somebody has to have the strength to turn this economy aroun-
