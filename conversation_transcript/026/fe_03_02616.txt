0.82 2.52 A: hi i'm kathy 

1.93 3.50 B: hi i'm shannon 

3.80 5.46 A: hi what is this 

5.91 7.40 A: (( have you ever done this before )) 

7.17 9.95 B: yeah actually just the first time was yesterday 

9.89 15.26 A: and what's the deal i i signed up for this thing and we're i'm supposed to talk to you about 

14.54 16.86 B: right they give you a topic 

15.39 17.19 A: (( arms inspection in )) 

17.19 21.91 B: each time they call they give you a topic and we talk for ten minutes about the topic 

17.39 18.38 A: okay 

21.86 22.84 A: okay 

21.98 26.67 B: and they're doing a linguistics test so we're just supposed to talk about it [laughter] 

26.42 27.46 A: okay 

27.20 28.64 B: for ten minutes yeah 

28.29 31.37 A: okay [laughter] how very strange 

31.91 35.28 A: all right uh what is it arms inspect- well what do you think about it 

35.24 41.04 B: um i actually think isn't it a little late i mean i thought the war was over what does it matter now 

41.15 42.12 A: right 

41.50 49.62 B: i thought he said that bush or whatever said it was over and we won and 

49.69 51.69 B: obviously it wasn't a big threat 

51.70 64.97 A: right but i think that's the thing it's the whole premise of going into iraq in the first place was that there were weapons of mass destruction and they haven't proved that there are any and they were in there and obviously have control over it 

57.16 58.06 B: mhm 

59.52 60.29 B: right 

64.85 71.42 A: and if they don't find any and do something about it then you know world opinion is still gonna be against them 

71.10 71.97 B: right 

72.22 77.09 A: [sigh] so i don't know i don't do you think there were ever any in the first place 

76.43 79.20 B: um i really 

79.37 86.39 B: have no idea i really didn't know much about it i just kinda hear what everyone else says 

86.36 88.51 A: [noise] were you did you support the war 

88.25 89.36 B: um 

90.80 94.12 B: [sigh] you know yes and no 

92.06 92.85 A: [noise] [laughter] 

95.05 98.07 B: no because it had nothing to do with us 

97.59 98.79 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

98.18 103.31 B: so why did we get involved but yes because i guess it was helping them out 

100.01 101.08 A: right 

103.45 104.85 A: right 

103.95 107.05 B: but a lot a lot of those people are ungrateful anyway 

107.13 109.98 B: they're still still backing him up and 

107.16 107.96 A: true 

110.39 113.61 A: [noise] and i don't know how much we actually see about how 

113.88 114.84 A: you know 

114.94 122.43 A: supportive everyone is i don't know if what we get from the media is true obviously they're gonna show people celebrating and being happy 

118.91 119.91 B: exactly 

121.93 123.11 B: yeah 

122.48 124.33 A: that we won but um 

124.92 126.59 A: (( [noise] i don't know [sigh] )) 

125.97 128.92 B: and about that's the arms inspection 

128.73 129.61 A: (( mm )) 

129.02 139.81 B: i don't even what what even does that mean they're we inspected what they suppo- supposedly had what kind of weapons they had they were supposedly using against us 

139.62 144.47 A: well i guess the thing was that in the first place it was supposed to be u._n. inspections 

143.96 145.24 B: mhm 

144.69 157.65 A: and the u._s. claimed to know more than the u._n. did and more than the u._n. could find so they agreed to send in these inspectors and then thought that they weren't doing anything they didn't find enough in time or something 

150.00 150.80 B: okay 

152.73 153.85 B: mhm 

157.27 158.08 B: right 

158.52 169.08 A: and then they went okay forget it we know that there are weapons of mass destruction we don't need the u._n. to tell us that and it's taking too long and they're not disarming so we're just gonna go in but i think the thing is 

169.31 172.51 A: we still don't know whether there were any weapons of mass destruction because 

172.63 175.91 A: the u._s. hasn't provided any sort of concrete proof 

175.59 180.76 B: right and they obviously they didn't really use any so there's really exactly no proof 

180.52 182.39 A: right and i guess 

183.26 187.08 A: since the first you know iraq war whatever in ninety one 

187.54 188.51 A: um 

188.74 198.55 A: part of the deal when everything was done was that iraq was supposed to let in weapons inspectors and then they kicked them out like after four years 

194.92 195.82 B: mhm 

197.94 198.74 B: uh-huh 

198.63 201.51 A: so it's still part of the you know 

201.95 212.11 A: agreement at the end of that war that inspections should go ahead so i guess whether or not there were was a war now in in the terms of ninety one 

203.45 204.40 B: right 

208.85 209.72 B: mhm 

212.96 217.46 A: they're still supposed to go in so i guess they should go in 

217.08 218.11 B: mhm 

217.49 219.72 A: but it's just gonna be interesting to see [noise] 

220.19 223.14 A: what happens if they don't find anything 

223.34 228.38 B: or what if they do find something and then what are what what if 

228.41 237.01 B: like iraq hears that the weapons inspectors are supposed to come in and so they just start firing off everything they got all these deadly weapons 

236.59 238.36 A: (( right i )) 

237.30 245.88 B: that we didn't we didn't find we didn't know about in the first place so we couldn't do anything about it they just start start shooting them off and whatever whatever they got over there i mean 

241.36 242.36 A: mhm 

246.47 258.84 A: i i don't know i mean the whole thing is so you know what are you supposed to do you think that people have these weapons so you wanna preemptively make sure that you're protecting yourself against these weapons that you're claiming that they have 

251.79 252.75 B: mhm 

256.22 257.00 B: right 

258.19 259.07 B: right 

258.90 262.29 A: but in order to do that you start a war which is gonna 

260.67 261.85 B: (( right yeah )) 

262.60 266.78 A: i i don't know it's it's interesting i really don't know where i stand 

264.70 265.57 B: and what 

266.15 270.60 B: what gave us the idea that they had these weapons over there in the first place [laughter] 

270.03 271.44 A: (( well i g- i )) 

271.74 274.67 A: i don't know hi sorry i guess um 

275.91 281.71 A: [noise] i don't know they they they say that they have their own intelligence they have chatter from the c._i._a. and 

281.84 287.21 A: this and that but i mean actual u._n. weapons inspectors since they went in again 

287.67 299.64 A: after the u._n. decided sometime you know last year to send them in they have been there for years and years so i don't know what the u._s. is doing in there in the first place and what they've found but and i don't know 

290.95 291.93 B: right 

293.36 294.28 B: mhm 

297.65 298.73 B: mhm 

300.20 302.85 A: why that became such an issue today like 

301.93 303.45 B: right right 

303.11 304.75 A: was it something that they 

304.78 312.68 A: found after ten years or like now we know that there are weapons but that we didn't know that before i really i don't know i guess they have to go in 

312.87 316.73 A: and it's never a bad thing for them to go in and check what's going on 

315.06 316.15 B: right 

316.80 323.08 A: and i i think that the the u._s. has to let them in has to want them to go in because 

321.72 322.64 B: mhm 

323.37 333.54 A: if they don't then it's kind of like it goes against their whole cause in the first place and they really must want them to find something 'cause if they don't then they'll forever be wrong even though they liberated these people 

329.30 330.17 B: uh-huh 

333.16 334.52 B: right right 

334.68 335.56 A: (( i don't )) 

334.72 338.99 B: and what happens if we do find something what are we gonna do with it [laughter] 

339.46 340.35 A: know 

339.56 343.81 B: we're gonna bring it back here and build a playground out of it or what [laughter] 

343.03 348.87 A: does does the u._s. still have weapons of mass destruction like aren't they we have nuclear weapons right 

348.83 358.05 B: see i really honestly i have you know very few opinions about it and i really have don't know for sure what even 

358.27 363.01 B: even anything about that i really you know i read what's in the paper and that's about it [laughter] 

360.79 361.60 A: yeah 

362.53 374.03 A: i don't know i wish i i really i'm not clear on it because i feel like so i read somewhere that there are something like five countries in the world that have nuclear weapons so then it becomes you know 

371.95 373.10 B: mhm 

374.53 380.97 A: iraq and this dictator and whatever can't have nuclear weapons while the country that is disarming them does 

377.80 378.79 B: (( mhm )) 

381.02 382.06 B: right 

381.91 385.94 A: but it's just that sort of we trust ourselves not to use them but don't trust them like with the 

386.32 387.04 A: (( stuff )) 

386.67 390.98 B: if other if these five other countries have it why aren't we going after them also 

390.83 394.75 A: right well because they're western countries and we don't care and i don't know 

394.88 401.02 B: 'cause i think they can probably do right they could they could all do just as much damage as as anyone could 

395.15 397.05 A: it could still all be about oil 

400.81 401.65 A: right 

402.75 406.65 A: i mean i don't know what the situation is now are they sending people in have they started 

406.44 413.47 B: i again have no idea i just actually read in the paper today that the war's over so i thought everything was over i didn't 

414.46 415.02 B: (( [noise] )) 

415.46 417.59 A: i don't know i really don't know 

417.68 421.25 A: i think things will start now that the war is over 

420.88 422.13 B: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

421.58 423.77 A: because the war accomplished 

422.44 424.51 B: i think that 

423.93 429.38 A: i don't know getting you know liberating people and blah blah blah but they didn't find any weapons 

426.91 427.80 B: mhm 

428.82 441.07 B: well i think they can go in i think they can probably go in easier now now that they you know he's saddam's not in power any more they can probably go in a lot easier it's probably a lot easier for them to actually go and find something 

436.46 437.32 A: mhm 

441.18 443.92 B: be able to search around without people down their throat 

443.97 452.24 A: and i guess the other thing is now that there are these experts and scientists and stuff that were involved in these supposed programs before who are turning themselves in 

450.08 450.91 B: uh-huh 

451.89 452.98 B: yeah 

452.30 454.87 A: so they're getting more intelligence from 

455.52 458.98 A: um you know the experts that they were trying to track down before 

458.29 459.29 B: yeah 

459.74 461.14 B: yeah 

460.50 463.03 A: but i think they have they have to do something because 

463.06 468.17 A: now they're saying that they think syria is protecting them and maybe knows something else so 

468.90 472.16 A: it's sort of like they've started something they have to finish it 

471.57 472.84 B: yeah 

473.26 475.03 B: how long is that gonna take 

473.73 474.45 A: so 

475.24 477.38 A: i don't know that i don't know 

477.75 478.98 B: (( [cough] )) 

478.77 488.30 A: [laughter] a while i think i mean if they find one thing it's justified in all of it it's almost like we're hoping to find something we never hope 

486.97 488.11 B: (( like what is )) 

488.31 492.30 B: what is classified as a a um 

492.90 496.96 B: a you know mass destructive weapon or whatever 

496.74 502.78 A: i guess like biological and chemical weapons nerve gas they said they had v._x. and i don't know 

499.45 500.62 B: yeah that's 

502.34 510.06 B: that's what they said iraq iraq supposedly had a lot of i thought was like chemical and they thought they were biological warfare and 

509.44 512.18 A: exactly and had like anthrax and stuff 

511.89 520.48 B: well that's the kind of stuff i think they should go in and check for that stuff then i'm i'm all for that i don't want you know people bringing anthrax over here any more at least 

519.91 521.18 A: mhm 

521.19 522.68 A: that's right so 

522.74 528.48 A: that to my understanding that's what they're looking for there was a lot of you know any of those 

528.88 536.48 A: i guess anything that when you have biological or chemical warfare it's mass destruction you can you know wipe out a whole population 

533.51 534.62 B: yeah 

536.21 537.02 B: uh-huh 

536.99 539.17 A: and nuclear weapons too i guess 

539.47 545.60 A: that's the one i'm kind of hazy about 'cause i but the thing is i feel like i don't know if the u._s. has chemical weapons 

545.04 546.47 B: mhm 

545.71 547.25 A: (( i don't know if we have like )) 

547.44 554.89 A: you know nerve gas and all this other stuff but i mean hello we did use a nuclear bomb on you know japan in world war two 

554.52 555.72 B: mhm 

555.12 561.91 A: and it's not gonna go away so i'm sure they're out there somewhere i don't know i really don't know how i feel about all this i wish i had more of an opinion 

561.77 570.41 B: well what about what about weapons inspection on us are they doing anything from over there to come over here and see what we have 

570.47 577.14 A: i think the whole deal is the weapons inspection notion came from the first ir- iraq war the gulf war 

576.65 577.51 B: mhm 

577.57 589.13 A: and no one else is being inspected it's the fact that you know iraq was believed to have these weapons and after the war part of the agreement you know war is over here is the you know 

583.53 584.38 B: mhm 

589.74 599.89 A: treaty and the agreement of peace part of it was let weapons inspectors in and i think that was a big issue too because they let them in they started doing their work then they kicked them out like 

594.24 595.23 B: mhm
