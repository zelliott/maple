4.22 6.89 A: hey my name's brett i'm fr- i'm from philly 

6.79 8.38 B: oh philadelphia 

7.99 9.74 A: yeah 

8.75 11.18 B: so what do you feel about this 

10.89 12.86 A: (( [laughter] um )) 

11.42 12.71 B: [laughter] 

13.24 15.84 A: are we only allowed to talk about this do you think 

16.05 17.93 A: i guess i guess that would be 

17.03 25.26 B: yeah i guess it means disarming you have to talk about disarming iraq and how we feel about it and should that be our main objective 

21.15 22.17 A: right 

25.00 27.18 A: right how 

26.19 28.08 B: i i i think we should 

28.09 33.25 B: that should be our main objective especially being from new york i mean you're from the east coast as well 

33.15 34.91 A: right 

33.52 39.00 B: and being close to what happened i think that should be their major concern 

39.71 42.48 A: yeah i g- i mean obviously if 

42.77 51.33 A: considering the fact that that's like i don't know the only if in with regards to what's a call it um [lipsmack] 

52.48 55.95 A: if you if if they have nuclear weapons and all that stuff 

56.18 59.25 A: um [laughter] i i don't know i'm not into this 

57.58 58.76 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

59.13 62.49 B: oh my my motto is get them before they get us 

62.04 66.34 A: right [laughter] like the preemptive strike thing but i don't 

65.41 69.77 B: you know and i'm not for going there and killing innocent lives but 

69.88 72.77 B: you know i have to look out for my own as well 

72.62 77.64 A: right but every all the money spent like on 

77.78 82.72 A: the military and all that can be spent in other ways also but then again if they are gonna be 

82.76 87.06 A: using nuclear weapons it doesn't matter what the hell we you know what i mean like we have 

86.06 89.22 B: that's true but our our government spends money 

89.13 90.59 A: no matter what 

89.95 95.79 B: right [laughter] so if they're if they're not spending it on military i'm sure they're spending it on 

91.06 92.15 A: (( on craziness )) 

96.25 98.82 B: other unnecessary things yeah 

96.76 98.07 A: something wasteful 

98.48 100.36 A: right 

99.36 103.09 B: i mean i try not to follow it too much because i get too aggravated 

103.50 110.75 B: and you know like i said i'm not pro war but i don't think people should be parading in the streets 

110.89 115.46 B: saying that we shouldn't go and fight for our country 'cause that's basically what we're doing 

115.66 120.07 A: right well they're talk- the people who are are you talking about the um 

120.57 122.45 A: protestors and everything they're 

122.84 130.24 A: they're not against our troops they're just against violence in general because they think that violence begets violence and all that stuff 

130.68 133.51 B: [noise] i would say i guess they have a point but 

130.92 131.68 A: but 

133.40 139.17 A: but like they're thinking idealistically and the world is practical it's not idealistic so 

139.47 142.89 B: but they wouldn't be saying that if it happened to them 

144.29 145.40 A: um 

144.71 155.67 B: you know i witnessed firsthand i you know i've lost neighbors to the world trade center and i almost lost three family members who were supposed to be there that that day so i i kinda think 

156.09 159.51 B: [sigh] we should go get them but then again you know 

159.73 162.17 B: i'm confused [laughter] 

161.42 163.00 A: yeah i don't think um 

164.57 167.93 A: it i think that a p- if someone 

168.69 175.33 A: was pers- personally affected by it and still has that mentality of the peace thing 

175.59 176.64 A: then 

176.74 188.42 A: like i respect that actually but like i said it's an idealistic thing and the world like if you're idealistic usually like the world like you know bites you in the ass or whatever because 

187.50 194.12 B: [laughter] i've been bitten many times [laughter] i said i've been bitten many times it's true 

190.70 191.79 A: what's that 

193.00 194.22 A: yeah there you go 

194.13 196.33 B: you you can't have one without the other 

196.54 199.30 B: you know you can't say i want peace but [sigh] 

199.68 202.30 B: you can't have you you can't live in peace if if 

199.71 203.78 A: that's that thing in order to have peace one must prepare for war or whatever 

203.62 207.93 B: right and i don't think we should sit back and wait for something else to happen 

207.88 209.02 A: right 

208.54 213.60 B: i think bush number one bush senior should have done this a long time ago 

213.95 216.92 A: right and that's why that's one of the 

217.59 222.13 A: like real reasons that we're that they probably went to war huh 

222.24 224.72 A: like the fact that he wanted to like 

225.42 227.75 A: make up for his dad's 

227.95 234.06 A: failures um the fact that there's like oil involved all that other stuff i don't know 

234.16 237.39 B: i could care less about the oil i think that's fair 

236.26 239.23 A: well you could but i mean the united states is 

237.70 239.63 B: no right mhm 

239.64 240.50 A: (( you know )) 

239.80 240.78 B: you're right 

240.59 242.80 A: their self interest and i don't know 

242.96 243.84 A: and 

243.03 250.23 B: i i think whatever we our concern should be just about protecting ourselves not taking from another country 

250.16 251.20 A: yeah but if 

250.89 255.63 B: i don't even think we should go there and free their country you know that's up to their people 

253.91 255.22 A: right like they 

255.37 258.91 A: the way they spun it the operation iraqi freedom 

258.96 264.29 A: it it should have been called o- operation we don't get bombed or we don't get gassed or whatever 

263.81 265.05 B: exactly 

264.96 268.90 A: i mean obviously that's not a very catchy title but i'm saying if if 

267.59 270.96 B: exactly no you're you're a hundred percent right i agree with that mhm 

270.37 276.43 A: right 'cause that's all spin iraqi freedom like the united states is the babysitter of democracy or whatever 

276.40 284.69 A: but there there's a the united states has to go to twenty or thirty they have to go to china now they have to go to tons of places now if they if they really 

284.62 292.53 A: like practice what they preach like they believe in everyone having freedom it just so happens that we go to a country that's like rich in oil 

292.86 299.08 A: and that also the father of the president like failed to beat the guy last i don't know 

299.12 303.69 A: it's kinda cyn- i don't know i mean i'm cynical about all this crap but 

303.36 307.14 B: you're right i i never thought of thought of it like that but you're right 

307.91 309.52 B: yeah exactly 

310.28 313.45 B: we shouldn't be we should be worried about ourselves 

314.55 315.70 A: well i mean 

314.94 317.18 B: rather than i mean i think it's 

317.99 322.66 B: i don't agree with how they treat women and kids and 

323.41 327.49 B: [sigh] and i don't agree with what they do but i think that's up to their own people 

327.26 334.36 A: right and that's their culture like we're not really able to understand not i don't think it's right either but um 

334.96 340.42 A: you know a large part of the world looks at a lot of those things a lot differently than we do 

340.78 345.04 A: like i mean not i i think it's wrong obviously to um 

346.03 346.95 A: you know 

348.08 355.93 A: take away people's like basic human rights or whatever i mean that's an obvious thing but they wouldn't see it because 

353.35 354.81 B: we could be spending it 

356.17 360.58 A: the way that they were raised and the their world view is so much different than ours 

360.76 364.59 A: like they they look at it as like they they're happy to give up those things 

365.19 366.77 A: at least some people do 

365.62 367.56 B: we're we're the bad guys 

367.25 368.58 A: what's that 

368.18 370.45 B: they look at us like the bad guys 

369.82 371.09 A: right 

370.51 377.91 B: we're the sinners we're we're going to hell we have television and our women don't wear burkhas and 

372.62 373.65 A: right 

377.26 378.59 A: all that stuff 

377.97 379.54 B: men control 

379.82 381.22 B: them i just 

381.50 384.79 A: well yeah obviously it's it's kinda ridiculous 

382.02 383.51 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

384.16 388.13 B: but like you said they can they'll have to do that in china also 

388.17 394.72 A: they'll have to do it everywhere there's no there's tons there's a lot yeah there's a lot of places in africa there's 

388.36 389.23 B: you know 

390.67 393.03 B: africa thailand yeah 

394.93 396.72 A: yeah 

396.73 400.03 A: like in the past um 

400.73 407.00 A: well they did they did help out with some of that like milosevic stuff that was going on and everything but 

406.61 413.07 B: well that's true they're doing that in china with the the uh sterilization laws and the forced abortions and 

412.91 419.10 A: but this is the difference is this was an all out war that cost like billions of dollars that like 

420.15 425.69 A: they were willing to like have many european nations like disagree with them like the only 

425.54 439.13 A: country that supported them was england i mean i didn't follow it very much either but i know i know that england's one of the only countries that supported them and that's probably due to the fact that they w- that has to do with trading and stuff i would think 

433.52 434.35 B: (( mhm right )) 

439.40 440.44 A: like 

440.48 441.41 B: of course 

440.51 442.37 A: you have i don't know 

442.68 444.53 B: of course oil 

444.67 446.84 A: yeah and and just 

445.95 449.72 B: and russia russia too russia traded them oil for uh 

449.84 454.18 B: i believe anthrax and nuclear weapons and stuff yeah 

451.38 452.86 A: weapons and stuff 

453.66 455.37 A: right 

454.78 456.36 B: smallpox 

457.22 461.15 A: is your is your participation in this through university of pennsylvania 

461.09 462.12 B: yes 

461.87 462.92 A: oh okay 

464.01 466.01 B: i guess yours is also right 

465.36 467.04 A: yeah but i didn't know 

467.29 470.49 A: that they like they must have done this all throughout a lot of 

470.85 474.91 A: i didn't realize they went they even would go outside of the city or whatever to do it 

474.62 477.82 B: oh yeah they go to uh texas i believe also 

477.52 478.71 A: oh really 

478.13 479.54 B: yeah 

480.58 482.79 B: which i this is the first time i've done this 

482.53 484.35 A: and they listen to this stuff 

484.02 485.93 B: yeah [laughter] 

486.47 488.81 B: i guess they wanna get your views on 

489.27 492.57 B: [sigh] the topics and what's going on in the world 

493.76 495.50 A: i guess that's what it is 

495.57 501.78 B: i think it's kinda cool though too because you get to speak with other people about different issues and 

501.18 503.13 A: right like some of the stuff 

503.33 507.50 A: yeah they said some example of some of the topics or whatever 

507.85 508.92 A: (( on the )) 

508.95 510.71 A: voice message or whatever 

510.87 515.34 A: did you hear it when you called or or no i read it or something i forget now 

515.11 518.90 B: no i didn't hear it they just said something about iraq and 

518.93 520.83 B: disarmament 

520.24 526.16 A: right but i meant like in i heard something else that like talked about just general what the topics would be like 

525.43 527.06 B: and no i didn't hear that 

527.09 528.17 A: anyway 

528.25 529.27 A: um 

529.47 532.47 A: is there supposed to be like a beep that goes off or whatever or 

531.63 534.02 B: i think so has it been ten minutes 

533.40 536.37 A: uh probably close to it if um 

534.86 536.05 B: [laughter] 

536.91 540.94 A: let me think about like it's weird 'cause like the topic just came on 

540.98 543.09 A: the person's voice or whatever and then 

543.21 545.69 B: it doesn't give you enough time to think 

545.10 554.18 A: yeah i mean obviously that's why i felt like retarded [laughter] trying to like trying to talk about it at first because i don't know but i'm a teacher also so 

553.74 554.93 B: really 

554.31 556.04 A: yeah 

554.96 556.35 B: what do you teach 

556.57 561.22 A: i teach um i teach high school to kids that like dropped out of school 

560.66 561.84 B: wow 

561.65 562.75 A: so 

562.13 564.58 B: oh i do occupational therapy 

564.55 566.64 A: (( all right )) 

565.72 569.15 B: yeah and i'm a student as well [laughter] 

569.16 577.15 B: it's probably why i don't have no time to watch the news or read the newspapers and sometimes it it's better not knowing 

574.10 575.27 A: right 

577.15 580.60 A: yeah i mean you're basically just being fed whatever spin 

580.62 585.51 A: the company that owns the newspaper or the t._v. station wants you to be fed anyway 

585.13 592.65 B: that's true whatever whatever they feel would make you read it more or they turn it towards their views and 

592.03 593.35 A: right 

592.85 595.84 B: i don't think we ever get the whole truth anyway 

595.55 597.56 A: right i don't think so either 

597.12 599.90 B: you know i don't think we see like the casualties
