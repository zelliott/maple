294.03 295.30 B: yeah

303.51 304.42 B: (( you know )) 

304.16 309.69 A: yeah my um my mom said when she she was like you know

314.14 315.53 B: how 'bout that 

314.99 322.68 A: she said that um i mean she wasn't against it but it was she got married when she was i guess she was like thirty 

317.92 319.14 B: right sure 

322.56 324.08 B: oh okay that's a good age 

322.98 329.29 A: which back in the day was a little bit on the late side now it's like normal but um 

326.15 327.92 B: oh it was sure was 

328.37 330.34 B: right now it's normal right 

330.08 334.82 A: but she said yeah i had a great time being single and had a lot of fun and i 

333.25 335.31 B: oh that's great oh that's great 

334.85 339.35 A: wasn't sure that i even you know i didn't need to have children 

339.54 341.67 A: like um but 

341.88 346.76 A: your father really wanted to and she said i'm glad i did you know but 

344.21 345.61 B: (( i'll be darned )) 

346.46 353.14 B: oh yeah and you're glad she did too [laughter] 

348.56 358.51 A: me too i'm like yeah good thing mom [laughter] that's a nice conversation we're having i was ah she was like no i i was glad i did but 

353.54 354.71 B: yeah 

357.73 358.83 B: sure 

359.02 359.99 A: yeah 

359.30 361.20 B: so you like it out in california 

361.04 370.41 A: i do i do i um it kinda gets a bad rep out here especially from people on the east coast it was like why you moving out there 

367.80 369.13 B: yeah sure 

370.37 385.30 A: but um it's funny because most of the people i work with are from the east coast a lot of people from philadelphia which is strange and um and so it doesn't and so many people out here it's so kind of transient that 

375.35 377.49 B: oh really no kidding 

377.64 378.86 B: i'll be darned 

384.73 386.21 B: yes i've heard 

385.29 397.26 A: it's easy to make friends because everyone is sort of new and just got into town and so it's been fun so far i mean i don't know if i i'm gonna stay out here forever 

394.28 395.57 B: that's great 

396.92 400.20 B: oh sure especially your family is back there 

400.13 401.06 A: right 

400.23 409.70 B: i always ask people when they move that far that's why i asked you you know how come you mo- i i just ask everyone that's moved that far 'cause i'm a person who's stayed here my whole life so i guess that's 

406.33 407.32 A: right 

409.52 415.50 B: you know i just wonder i guess it's a lot of ah different reasons for people some people go to school and 

415.20 416.21 A: right 

415.53 420.43 B: some people it's job that's probably you know the big biggest reasons i would imagine 

420.13 426.69 A: well the thing about where we're from too is it's such a nice area and there's there's so much to do 

426.35 428.04 B: oh yeah that's what i love 

426.80 433.76 A: that i mean you kinda don't really need to unless you have like a goal in mind like ah 

432.91 434.12 B: that's true 

434.01 435.98 A: for a job or 

436.05 439.39 A: i don't know for a relationship or school or whatever 

438.97 440.13 B: right 

439.57 444.84 A: so but actually my my boyfriend lives in philadelphia [laughter] 

444.10 450.46 B: really oh that's fascinating how was it maintaining a long distance relationship that that subject fascinates me 

444.91 446.13 A: he does 

450.38 458.95 A: you know well i was really nervous but we i was living in new york and he was living in philadelphia so it was always sort of 

453.68 455.01 B: oh sure uh-huh 

458.99 461.85 A: a long distance thing from 

460.81 463.40 B: oh really from the beginning i'll be darned 

462.38 468.87 A: the beginning we we had known each other we had met like briefly when we were in high school we didn't go to the same high school 

467.06 468.05 B: mhm 

468.94 476.51 A: um and then ah we had like a lot of mutual friends and we kind of met up again and we started dating and 

477.21 485.87 A: then i decided that i really just wanted to i wanted to try california and i just figured i should go now because if i waited longer i wouldn't do it 

482.99 484.13 B: yeah 

485.02 487.32 B: that's true yeah yeah 

486.30 493.92 A: so i um i talked to him about it and he actually he's always wanted to move out here as well

494.12 498.39 A: so he is trying to he's been looking for work out here 

498.19 499.19 B: oh 

498.44 505.85 A: so he's thinking about making the move i mean i i'm not holding my breath because it's a big thing to ask someone 

503.60 504.83 B: yeah 

504.84 506.26 B: (( oh i know )) 

505.87 510.44 A: it was really hard moving out here picking up and and moving out but 

510.61 511.60 A: um 

511.03 516.16 B: oh it must of been see myself i can't imagine it but that's just me i guess i'm a little set in my ways 

515.87 519.62 A: no yeah but it's it's tough anybody who's done it 

518.62 520.47 B: oh it must be gosh 

519.64 526.06 A: knows that it's ah you know it's not easy and you really like most of my friends are in philadelphia 

525.65 526.85 B: yeah 

526.21 527.62 A: and um 

528.02 530.53 A: and so it's a little bit tough but

530.86 533.67 A: (( i'm so glad i'm talking to someone from philly )) 

533.12 540.93 B: yeah this is great isn't this something yeah that's funny you're from here and then you moved out to california that that's really something
