206.13 208.31 B: right right 

206.97 212.51 A: because it would just be such a loss if something happened to them i don't know if i could cope

231.11 231.93 B: (( oh )) 

232.69 233.93 B: okay 

234.37 237.84 A: but we're experiencing um budget cuts 

237.11 240.27 B: so are we in fact i just went to a meeting 

238.12 240.06 A: yeah 

240.32 253.39 B: today they're cutting our health insurance like way back where we're going to have to start paying a percentage of our we used to be on h._m._o. and now it's still going to be like an h._m._o. but you still you have to pay like twenty per cent of all your 

253.84 262.38 B: all your things you go to like your lab work xrays stuff like that and we've never had to do that here in texas so it's going to be a huge 

262.31 263.36 A: wow 

262.97 265.34 B: huge huge huge thing 

264.17 264.83 A: (( how )) 

265.04 267.00 A: upsetting because 

266.83 267.84 B: right 

267.06 274.81 A: it's just hard enough financially you know you feel like you everybody lives within their means so then when they add more expenses 

270.63 272.52 B: right 

273.68 276.16 B: right and they don't give you any more income 

275.63 277.17 A: exactly 

276.26 278.61 B: (( but they add more expenses )) 

277.94 282.06 A: and then they have this attitude well just be glad you have health insurance 

281.72 292.64 B: exactly that's what they were saying today look at all these people in the world that have lost their jobs have no health insurance be glad you have health insurance but i'm like look you know that's not the way we look at it 

282.56 283.69 A: (( but )) 

284.24 284.94 A: (( they )) 

292.26 295.69 A: right we look at it like how are we ever going to do this 

295.10 301.74 B: exactly and i think texas had to cut like nine no twenty one billion dollars 

300.90 302.04 A: oh 

301.88 309.60 B: so they're cutting wherever they can and i guess i'm just should be very thankful that i still have a job since 

309.10 313.26 A: yeah they're laying off like crazy it is scary you know 

310.99 314.71 B: yeah it's very scary 

314.20 325.47 A: and then i mean if you could have seen the rich people at enron i mean our country is getting to be like the third world countries where there's the very wealthy and the very poor 

325.07 326.92 B: exactly 

325.51 328.27 A: and the middle class is just disappearing 

327.85 330.09 B: mhm that's true 

330.17 335.72 A: and nobody can afford a home any more i mean the price of housing's just out of sight 

334.56 336.36 B: [noise] i know 

335.88 348.74 A: i was looking at houses just this weekend and i mean the average house 'cause i'm in an expensive area but in ann arbor the average home is two hundred and forty thousand yeah you know [laughter] 

345.44 346.95 B: oh my goodness 

348.59 353.14 B: and it seems like the richer keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer 

351.31 352.44 A: yeah 

352.75 367.33 A: yeah and we keep having more expenses like now we have to pay our health insurance and they don't even pay their taxes i mean we probably pay more taxes than they do because they can afford all these tax cuts 

357.86 359.87 B: right 

362.88 365.38 B: than they do mhm 

367.16 368.49 B: exactly 

368.47 373.56 A: so it makes me angry that um the government i don't know what the government could do 

373.76 376.96 A: to improve it but it would seem like um 

378.41 385.20 A: i don't know i talk to people from other countries you know and um specialize medicine so so i'm pretty good at this point 

383.43 384.66 B: that's true 

385.35 389.13 B: i know i know it does sound good 

387.24 388.71 A: and 

388.76 400.66 A: right and they have a lot of other benefits too as far as housing goes and like if they don't work out in the one job then there's other jobs they can do you know while they look for something else and 

398.57 399.55 B: right 

400.81 404.93 A: i mean it seems like our country is just getting um 

405.36 407.50 A: so that it's very hard to live here 

407.19 408.15 B: right 

408.47 413.19 A: you know and the elderly are really suffering my mother is in her nineties now 

412.70 414.14 B: oh my goodness 

413.50 416.99 A: yeah and like her income back from when she worked 

417.18 425.08 A: you know with inflation i mean and the rate of her social security because of the rate of money that she earned back then 

425.28 431.06 A: um i mean when you're old you're um unable to improve your situation and and you're 

430.41 431.99 B: right 

431.55 432.46 A: (( stuck )) 

432.53 433.74 B: it's sad 

433.64 434.74 A: yeah 

434.58 444.90 B: and it seems like they're cutting the government is cov- cutting more and more for the elderly i know here in texas they are trying to do away with almost the whole entire elderly and disabled program 

445.04 450.83 B: just to save money and i just can't we have a lot of old people in texas i don't know what they're going to do 

449.07 450.76 A: yeah 

450.92 452.70 B: i feel so bad for them 

452.86 456.18 A: they say with the baby boomers you know all turning 

456.47 466.25 A: middle aged now that our country's going to be a lot older everywhere each day in michigan in the next twenty years it will be like florida 

457.72 459.42 B: mhm 

460.44 462.75 B: right exactly 

466.35 467.50 B: wow 

467.20 470.84 A: i know [laughter] with all the seniors you know 

468.11 469.29 B: [laughter] 

470.56 472.17 B: oh my goodness 

471.07 473.45 A: and the three page obituaries 

473.62 475.87 B: [laughter] 

474.06 482.02 A: (( you know [laughter] is what i think when visited st petersburg i was amazed at the obituary columns it took pages yeah )) 

480.57 481.86 B: really 

481.88 483.59 B: oh my gosh 

482.25 484.32 A: i'm exaggerating but they took 

484.36 486.96 A: (( a good two pages you know )) 

486.78 488.46 B: oh my goodness 

487.02 489.71 A: [laughter] i know so 

489.08 491.21 B: that's funny 

489.99 492.49 A: know what they'll accomplish by 

492.95 495.73 A: well they expect for us to take care of them 

495.51 498.42 B: exactly exactly 

496.69 500.11 A: you know but we can't afford a house so where are they going to go 

499.79 500.93 B: right 

500.81 503.70 A: [laughter] i don't know so 

503.53 505.56 B: it's sad 

503.75 507.81 A: i was hoping maybe the economy was better other places 

507.62 509.35 B: i don't think it is 

509.47 513.08 B: i know my father in law and my father right now are out of work 

512.66 514.29 A: are they really 

513.55 518.33 B: and it's all because of nine i mean everything down trickled from nine eleven 

518.54 523.35 B: and they both are out of work now and they both they have been out of work since christmas both of them 

523.43 535.44 B: and i mean they had executive level jobs and both of them have only had yeah older like in their my father is in his sixties and my father in law is in his fifties but 

526.74 527.96 A: yeah 

528.38 530.01 A: and they are older now 

535.57 539.61 A: not old enough to retire so yeah 

537.22 543.61 B: right exactly so they're fast and furiously looking for a job and they can't 

542.59 545.11 A: who's going to hire 'em at that age 

544.38 547.75 B: exactly they're overqualified you 

547.60 551.45 A: yeah and they expect a higher salary than somebody that's 

548.16 549.09 B: (( know )) 

550.60 551.75 B: exactly 

552.56 554.15 B: (( exactly )) 

553.84 556.63 A: plus they have higher medical expenses 

556.15 557.25 B: uh-huh 

557.70 560.84 B: yeah and i feel so bad for them 

558.07 559.18 A: (( so )) 

560.90 562.74 A: i hope that 

561.09 566.85 B: 'cause neither one of 'em i think they've had each had a phone interview and that's about it 

566.98 569.62 B: nothing has they haven't had anything 

568.24 572.00 A: that's so scary i am so sorry it is it's just 

571.64 572.85 B: i know 

572.43 574.21 A: so upsetting that 

574.50 579.50 A: you know especially when it hits home with people that you love you know 

578.95 580.86 B: (( mhm )) 

579.73 582.29 A: and you see how upsetting and 

582.47 586.05 A: they probably still have their homes they're paying for 

585.45 586.86 B: yes they do 

586.22 590.94 A: plus you can't retire because the stock market has taken away all of 

589.77 591.81 B: all of your money uh-huh 

591.92 599.89 B: that's what my dad said he hadn't really had a retirement fund in years and then he had put all of his money into the stock market 

599.43 599.89 A: yeah
