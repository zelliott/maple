334.74 335.74 A: yeah 

335.15 338.20 B: even if they were born here in the united states

347.80 353.65 B: you know i'm i'm pretty much in the same boat i mean even though i'm african american 

353.83 355.81 B: i cannot trace my 

355.86 357.57 B: heritage back 

357.85 359.58 B: past my great 

359.59 362.21 B: grandparents for obvious

380.51 381.57 A: wow

389.56 394.45 B: i've had discussions in the past with caucasians and i ask them well

400.75 401.65 A: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

401.58 409.34 B: but i've asked them about their ethnicity and they just they draw like this blank oh i'm just american

425.86 428.12 B: many families immigrated 

428.30 429.37 B: to

433.16 441.92 A: know if you don't pay you know if you if your heritage wasn't passed down when your family came over to america then you probably don't know it you 

440.98 445.95 B: right it just melted that that's right that's just it just melted and 

444.05 444.76 A: (( know ))
