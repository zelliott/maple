265.50 266.84 A: mhm 

266.22 273.29 B: that's closest to me in age but over the past i'd say over the past five years we've drawn away from each other 

272.97 273.74 A: (( mm )) 

273.85 277.13 B: and so we don't talk as much 

277.36 283.44 B: and right now my my baby brother who's the twenty four year old is living with us

362.09 363.23 A: right 

363.04 367.78 B: so that's kind of neat you know that and he accepts my family as that 

367.87 370.20 B: so it's real we're real close 

370.35 371.77 A: that's sweet 

371.87 378.15 A: it's sweet that he's taking in your younger brother as well as you are too like you all have to communicate and live together now

406.76 409.23 B: um and i think family is very 

408.34 411.41 A: he's young too twenty four is young 

410.92 414.26 B: yeah yeah um now 

414.52 416.91 B: are you are you a church going person

418.33 419.44 B: okay 

419.25 420.28 A: um 

420.72 422.56 A: and my family 

423.34 428.11 A: is synagoguish but i actually since i've moved away from home 

428.26 429.34 A: i came 

429.70 433.02 A: to philadelphia actually to go to graduate school in jewish education 

432.53 433.56 B: mhm 

433.33 447.02 A: and i joined a synagogue and i'm i'm thirty three but i joined about five years ago and it's very not so odd but it's it is a little bit odd for a single person under the age of forty to join a synagogue 

447.23 453.97 A: it's usually very family oriented um so it's been it's been an interesting experience like um you 

449.17 450.40 B: wow 

454.13 459.59 A: know people invite me over for dinner sometimes and my my brother used to tease me like why are you going to synagogue 

459.15 461.02 B: (( [laughter] )) 

460.00 461.12 A: (( um )) 

461.19 462.30 A: but it's 

463.26 465.57 A: it's a it's a way of like making a 

466.19 468.29 A: not family but community 

468.94 472.57 A: and i think that's that's equally indifferent and important because i think 

469.02 471.10 B: (( yeah )) 

473.18 475.64 A: meeting community you know 

476.46 483.66 A: it's like this is the cold call you have a chance to be seen in a different light than all of your mis- all the stuff that you grew up with 

483.88 485.40 A: (( so i think i have )) 

485.68 490.33 A: different relationships with a lot of people who are older than i am like in their fifties 

489.74 490.70 B: mhm 

490.43 492.92 A: who kind of mentor me or 

493.07 503.29 A: i wouldn't say they parent me but they have or get a perception of me which helps me kind of grow differently than my perception by my parents i think that they have you know and then i come home again 

503.70 507.99 A: and i'm talking about valuable relationships that i have with people of diverse ages 

508.26 513.09 A: people who have children young children and teenagers i think it has been um 

515.19 515.96 A: (( i guess )) 

517.53 521.19 A: just a good way of meeting just that meeting people at different 

521.32 522.78 A: life ages 

523.34 525.77 A: um i got a new experience what they're 

525.85 528.48 A: how they feel with different parts of life whether it's 

528.49 533.36 A: family issues for them or life cycle events marriages or death 

533.94 541.84 A: or just hard work and people losing jobs has been a huge topic of conversation i lost my job six months ago 

542.22 545.89 A: and i have been tempor- working temporary jobs and my brother 

546.55 553.63 A: who bought a house a year ago and just had a baby a few months ago which has been a real wonderful thing lost his job 

554.16 555.48 A: (( and ah )) 

555.66 557.97 A: you know when i talk about my parents and i feel 

558.08 566.69 A: i feel very judged and i don't feel very supported and then i go out and i talk to people in the community and i'm like all right this is a normal thing it's a horrible thing right now but 

565.97 567.05 B: mhm 

567.11 568.48 A: kind of normal 

569.29 570.10 A: so 

569.93 578.07 B: and and the reason why i asked that was you know if you went to church or um because we we were pastors 

577.47 578.70 A: (( oh yeah )) 

578.31 579.66 B: and um 

580.04 586.99 B: kind of kind of maybe a lot of people considered us strange pastors in the church world i guess 

587.03 588.48 B: and um 

588.91 590.79 B: we always taught 

590.66 593.46 A: who's who's we you and your husband or in your family 

593.71 596.86 B: well actually my dad was a minister 

596.30 597.06 A: uh-huh 

597.01 599.90 B: and i am also a minister and my husband is a minister
