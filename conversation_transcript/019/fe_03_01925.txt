323.25 324.62 A: yeah 

324.01 328.36 B: as you can see it happens in the news so much you know 

328.65 331.27 B: you never know what you're facing 

331.25 334.48 A: yeah i wouldn't want to teach high school at all 

331.97 333.03 B: and 

334.14 340.68 B: uh you know me i did it a high school a couple of weeks ago and i told them i wouldn't come back again 

340.50 343.17 A: [laughter] why were they like really rude 

342.38 344.15 B: it was a very good experience 

344.61 345.50 A: oh 

345.14 350.07 B: and uh not many of the kids uh um 

350.32 354.76 B: just don't have much respect to teachers like they did when i was in school 

354.69 358.35 A: no they don't seem to have much respect for much of any thing 

357.60 365.96 B: right and when i went to school the teacher was like somebody you looked up to who when they said something you you know 

366.13 368.81 B: (( you got to chill oh i better )) 

369.19 377.97 B: and they look at you and tell you you know hey you know this is basically the way that i am and so i don't want to 

378.43 379.86 B: really uh 

380.00 385.26 B: wanna deal on that level again and i find that little ones i can reach better 

385.27 390.02 B: and you know you can just uh how can i put it 

390.57 397.16 B: i just feel that they're more receptive [laughter] you know 

395.33 397.40 A: yeah think probably 

397.25 398.69 B: you know so 

399.42 408.11 B: basically and i think now with the break down of the family and you can see the results of that break down on the school 

408.30 411.83 B: a lot more kids are coming from broken homes 

411.87 420.75 B: a lot of them coming from one parent homes and there are a lot of them coming from homes where they've been raised by grandparents who 

420.99 422.70 B: you know um 

423.61 435.01 B: i don't know uh coming from this generation that got lost and they got caught up and drugs and other life style which left 

435.43 438.56 B: uh grandparents raising a lot of kids and 

438.16 439.84 A: mhm 

439.37 444.61 B: um sometime i look around the school and parents and coming up and a lot of times 

444.73 449.01 B: it's the grandparents coming up and with the break down of the 

446.59 447.62 A: uh-huh 

449.48 456.61 B: you know you can see that uh you can see the result of that in the kid 

456.97 458.29 A: yeah 

457.75 460.77 B: so that's why you know i try 

461.08 462.93 B: to help my kids 

463.22 466.46 B: and my nieces just how important their family is 

466.78 472.11 B: and you know it doesn't matter who raises them just as long as somebody raises them who 

472.95 474.08 A: yeah 

473.95 475.54 B: (( you know ))
