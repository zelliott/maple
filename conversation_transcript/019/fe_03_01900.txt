3.07 4.95 A: hi my name is shula 

5.24 6.17 B: shula 

5.87 6.83 A: yes 

6.42 7.92 B: hi shula how are you 

7.52 8.96 A: i'm fine how are you 

8.62 9.80 B: fine thanks 

9.91 20.92 B: ah talking about family do you want to start or should i share my okay well my first thought of family is that bonds should not be broken short of something really heinous 

12.84 14.59 A: you can start [laughter] 

21.28 25.75 B: that we accept in family that we might not accept 

25.81 28.01 B: what we wouldn't accept in other people 

28.08 29.25 B: and 

29.56 32.92 B: that is really my my strong belief on it 

34.10 45.26 A: um for me family means a bond you know where you can connect and you can talk about anything with this person and if you you know it's like a confidante also 

41.93 42.67 B: (( um )) 

45.22 45.88 B: (( um )) 

45.56 48.11 A: and you can depend on that person for anything 

48.49 58.13 B: [lipsmack] okay i i agree with the depending on them i think family i believe family should always be to be able to depend on each other 

58.28 71.05 B: i wish i had the experience of family being confidantes because i know that in some of my immediate family my sister one sister in particular we're not we're not confidantes and we're 

71.07 81.75 B: often at odds and another one i is a confidante so i i don't have that experience unfortunately with every member of my family my mother i do my dad 

81.76 86.70 B: i don't so it's it's a little more neutral when i talk to him 

86.98 91.78 A: oh um um i have a sister's like one year older than me 

90.60 91.33 B: (( um )) 

91.84 94.36 A: and she's my confidant and 

94.37 96.33 A: you know we grew up together 

96.20 97.02 B: (( um um )) 

96.69 104.15 A: i got married before she did she got married she moved to where i live [laughter] you know 'cause she married someone you know where i live 

103.95 104.78 B: (( um um )) 

104.30 108.36 A: so you know we get along great we don't have an argument or anything 

106.63 107.48 B: yeah 

108.18 118.67 B: yeah yeah well i do i've got one of those sisters too it's funny that you said a year that you're a year apart i i remember noticing this when i was uh a teenager 

118.92 127.25 B: one of my dearest friends had a sister a year younger another good friend had a sister i think a year and a half older 

127.18 139.01 B: and i i remember saying to my mom once i think when siblings are close in age no more than two years apart they tend to be really like friends and in my situation ah we're five years apart 

139.29 148.61 B: so when i think of the sister that i'm close to she's the oldest one she's actually a little over eight years older than me but the other one is five years older and 

145.73 146.61 A: (( um uh-huh )) 

148.69 153.16 B: so so the one that i i've always had a better um 

153.46 157.46 B: communicating relationship with is the oldest and i'm the youngest and 

158.35 163.16 B: it even even that we can share and talk about just everything 

163.49 169.60 B: now now less but i remember when i was younger especially when i was a teenager and in my early twenties and that kind of thing 

169.74 182.09 B: there's a difference you know the eight plus years was different than when you're in your forties and fifties you know it's like being fifteen and twenty four miles apart just miles apart 

171.98 172.68 A: (( well )) 

182.49 190.08 A: i'm from a huge family [laughter] so you know we're pretty close and you know i'm the youngest girl i have two younger brothers 

185.67 186.68 B: yeah 

189.59 190.36 B: mm 

190.14 194.82 A: and there was thirteen of us so [laughter] [laughter] 

191.85 201.84 B: oh wow [laughter] oh your mom your mom was was a busy lady [laughter] well we didn't we didn't have that i mean i've got a 

197.76 199.41 A: [laughter] 

202.37 210.70 B: you know it's funny about family i i always thought of my family up until i was on my own in my early twenties as a really close family because 

211.01 225.36 B: um we did everything together and so there were three kids in my family but aunts uncles and children everything was together you know every weekend every holiday every everything you know friday night watching 

225.41 230.34 B: t._v. it was it was always a family thing as far as 

230.53 239.32 B: aunts cousins being there uncles being there it was it was really very centered around the family and so i always think of it as as close but as 

239.40 246.54 B: as i got older especially as i get into my teenage years and my older cousins and my sisters started 

246.79 250.32 B: going off in their directions and married and whatnot it um 

250.20 262.67 B: yeah it definitely changed especially the sister that i i was never close to we just never we butted heads you know we just [laughter] we she she says dysfunctional and i'll be you know i'll agree with her 

262.95 270.85 B: oh she was she i'm i'm sure that she [laughter] she probably wanted to ring my neck a whole lot of times and she tried too 

271.08 275.64 B: um and then the older one was the mediator she was the the diplomat 

271.19 272.08 A: yeah 

275.47 285.56 A: well see because my family's so big and the years so different my older sisters usually take used to take care of us and so that was like a mother to us too 

282.27 282.99 B: mm 

285.20 287.98 B: yeah yeah that was my oldest sister definitely 

287.29 290.44 A: so you know now family is like 

290.63 299.20 A: just there we won't you know for my mom my mom and dad has the same birthday so usually we have them a party go home for their birthday every year 

298.85 299.67 B: (( um um )) 

299.32 301.71 A: and you know just everybody comes home 

301.52 302.36 B: yeah 

302.16 303.47 A: and you know 

303.62 306.87 A: and usually if we don't take our husbands with us 

307.01 309.24 A: all of us just stay at the house [laughter] 

308.43 309.03 B: (( um )) 

309.15 311.30 B: and it's just as much fun probably 

311.06 312.10 A: (( well yes )) 

311.69 315.95 B: yeah it probably is more fun i think the thing the nice thing about family 

316.82 321.57 B: sat in as as you get older you spend less time with your birth family 

321.77 325.88 B: because you've got your own which is usually created through marriage 

326.09 327.18 B: and 

327.90 334.89 B: so the the family contact from the childhood and before marriage days you know 

334.98 347.32 B: is is less and so that's the sad part but then on the other hand when when families do get together as we're adults it it seems a lot more precious 

346.83 347.79 A: (( um um )) 

347.42 353.07 B: because of the memory so yeah that uh families families are an education 

352.95 358.38 A: yeah i'm i'm learning firsthand i'm i've got an eight month old now so 

353.09 354.51 B: i i 

358.33 363.92 B: oh you do okay i have no children so this is this is interesting about family because 

358.89 360.47 A: yeah [laughter] 

364.06 372.64 B: i have to i've got to wonder i'm i'm the youngest of three daughters and they all no boys in the family and i'm gonna be forty seven in a week 

372.23 373.14 A: (( um )) 

373.20 375.76 B: and my two older sisters no children either 

375.96 377.31 B: none of us had children 

377.20 380.11 A: oh oh well this is my first 

377.66 378.96 B: all of us 

379.93 380.97 B: yeah 

380.35 382.31 A: and my last [laughter] 

381.68 385.65 B: so i i got to wonder at this point if i if 

385.76 391.27 B: if i ah really had this wonderful family life that i thought i had when i was when i was a kid 

391.28 393.53 B: because we've all had a divorce 

393.75 397.98 B: in the case of my middle sister two [lipsmack] and 

395.32 395.96 A: (( um )) 

398.24 404.08 B: none of us had children and it's um i definitely think about that what what happened 

403.60 405.68 A: i thought i thought i had gotten away 

405.94 410.74 B: [laughter] so you have one and and and you're you're done
