0.70 1.79 B: hello 

1.45 2.92 A: (( hello )) 

2.74 4.01 B: i'm mary 

3.59 5.70 A: i'm mary too [laughter] 

5.01 6.56 B: oh two marys 

5.94 7.77 A: yeah it's easy to remember huh 

7.44 9.57 B: uh-huh i live in minnesota 

9.19 10.90 A: oh i live in wisconsin 

10.63 12.40 B: oh we're neighbors then 

12.10 13.51 A: yeah 

12.88 13.81 B: um 

13.93 19.23 B: i'm ah fifty years old and my husband's ten years older than me and getting close to retirement 

19.02 20.23 A: oh 

19.80 31.44 B: and so that um the thing about the corporate scandals or ethics you know i think is really important because it's affecting a lot of people especially those that are close to retirement and in retirement 

29.49 30.59 A: mhm 

31.30 33.43 A: yeah i think it's really important too 

33.75 39.30 A: i mean you just can't if we don't trust in the system you know nobody wins so 

39.84 41.72 A: i think it's very important 

41.93 49.74 B: yeah and i'm just i'm just kind of afraid that george bush or even though i voted for him is that he is a big businessman and 

49.77 51.84 B: i'm not really sure if he 

52.10 54.32 B: is willing to clamp down on 

54.81 59.54 B: you know those fraud and the things that have happened i mean he was friends with ken lay 

59.87 67.35 B: and i think ken lay was responsible for a lot of the things that were going on in enron but it doesn't seem that he's being held responsible 

67.24 70.82 A: hm i'm not familiar with him but um 

71.06 76.65 A: yeah i believe you [laughter] the stuff that went on with enron was was crazy you know 

72.42 73.46 B: [laughter] 

76.97 86.19 B: do you um do you have any like do you work for a big company or any company that has been in the news lately at all about any of the things that have been happening with 

85.59 90.32 A: no uh-huh nothing about it really affects me personally 

90.08 91.07 B: okay 

90.42 91.36 A: so 

92.17 100.59 A: it's just all theoretical but i can certainly relate to it you know i can imagine if you were working and lost everything you'd saved it would be 

100.96 102.79 A: (( you know catastrophic )) 

102.36 108.03 B: yeah well one of the reasons i kind of stay up on it too is i read the wall street journal every day 

107.87 108.87 A: (( do you )) 

108.58 113.76 B: and when you read the wall street journal it's very alarming to see what's happening 

113.61 114.66 A: (( mm )) 

113.87 120.87 B: one of the things lately is that um like say several major airlines are on the teetering or already filed for bankruptcy 

120.47 121.90 A: (( mhm )) 

121.31 126.42 B: and then you read that the tops the top level people the executives 

125.82 127.17 A: mhm 

126.56 134.21 B: are writing in all kinds of protection for their own retirements you know and huge bonuses and huge retirements 

133.70 134.89 A: mhm 

134.22 138.88 B: at the same time they're asking the lower people to take all these pay cuts 

138.23 140.80 A: mhm i have heard about that yeah 

140.17 146.87 B: yeah and it's just recently been happening with american airline even though i don't know if they're officially filed yet or not 

146.49 147.49 A: uh-huh 

147.33 155.93 B: but um so all the different unions that were involved were taking their votes and the only one that hadn't really finished or had an opportunity to 

155.91 169.95 B: to redo their vote was the flight attendants and then when they they had heard that the top people had written in all these bonuses and retirement perks for themselves so they redid their vote and they voted voted down to take the pay cut 

158.52 159.59 A: mhm 

169.83 170.68 A: (( mm )) 

170.34 179.62 B: so the board pressured the president who had the president who had decided to push this through you know for the pay raises for the top people 

177.24 178.15 A: mhm 

179.37 180.59 A: mhm 

179.92 182.62 B: and so now they've forced him out 

182.71 184.02 A: (( well that's good )) 

183.08 195.46 B: because of the stance of the flight attendants and the other unions you know revolting to that they were not going to give any concessions if the people at the top were you know asking for these but yet going the opposite way on themselves 

194.87 195.91 A: mhm 

195.50 199.76 B: and so my husband and i just had a long discussion about this actually before the phone call 

199.65 203.46 A: wow that's weird you didn't know what the topic was gonna be 

200.72 201.71 B: yeah 

202.93 203.79 B: no 

203.67 207.28 A: wow [laughter] you're ready to talk about it then 

204.73 206.26 B: and he he works for 

206.83 212.54 B: yeah and he works for a major company and they just had a meeting yesterday on business ethics you know so 

212.11 213.25 A: (( oh )) 

212.69 219.46 B: he was just leaving for work and i said oh this phone call subject is business you know the ethnics and things going on but 

219.49 225.98 B: i mean i really do feel that we need a president who's willing to get in there and say we've gotta clean up this mess on wall street 

225.41 227.11 A: mhm mhm 

226.51 232.63 B: and it's not even so much just the big companies when you're starting i mean when you read the wall street journal you see all these 

232.70 238.24 B: things that are being looked into about cheating like even on the trading floor and how people are getting 

238.18 251.72 B: information and even though some of the people who are called specialists on the trading floor they might be able to profit only by a few pennies because of their inside knowledge when you multiply it times the number of share of stock that they sell 

251.61 253.01 A: mhm 

252.35 264.45 B: you know that they're everybody's getting their little cut of things and all these things have been kind of known about but nobody's really stepped up and said much about them so they're it seems like they're checking into a lot more things now 

255.28 256.73 A: sure yeah 

264.30 267.45 A: well that's good that's a beginning anyway 

266.86 273.24 B: yeah but every time you read about a new thing coming out it shakes the stock market a little bit more in my opinion 

271.96 274.21 A: oh yeah yeah it does 

273.91 278.41 B: and it seems like you know it causes you know the overall values to drop 

277.97 280.67 A: mhm and people 

278.83 285.39 B: the company the company my husband works for the stock has gone from a high i was looking at a chart just a little while ago 

285.52 294.09 B: from a high in nineteen ninety nine of sixty eight dollars well they're really happy because right now i think it was trading at nine dollars and something 

293.64 299.15 A: oh jeez and i suppose you invested in that hoping to 

298.07 300.12 B: um not by choice 

299.62 300.96 A: not by choice 

300.31 312.34 B: only because it was part of you know the say they didn't have a match they had um where they would give you employee stock options i mean you didn't you just took them because that's what they said that they would give you so 

307.76 308.90 A: mhm 

312.15 313.25 A: (( mhm god )) 

312.91 320.87 B: and so you go from being on paper you know where the stock was worth almost seventy dollars and the low that it's been as low as four dollars 

321.25 327.89 B: so it changes quite a bit and it's just i mean it's something that of course you can say well i got it for nothing but it was part of your pay 

327.49 328.82 A: yeah 

328.18 335.50 B: you know and and you counted on it by saying oh this is what you'll have for retirement and then all of a sudden it goes from what it was 

335.39 338.54 A: was his company involved in a scandal 

337.99 339.18 B: yes 

338.64 339.63 A: it was 

339.33 346.12 B: yeah his was one of the companies that was actually one of the ones that was one of the first ones involved in some scandals 

345.79 351.68 A: oh boy [laughter] he still has his job though and he's plans to keep it 

347.26 348.62 B: yeah 

350.40 356.61 B: yeah he still has his job and they've had a lot of you know like it's it's a worldwide company so they've 

356.68 363.39 B: had announcements you know that they were reducing this many and this many i mean they've done that routinely over the years but 

362.67 363.83 A: mhm 

363.73 365.90 B: it wasn't anything like the enron i 

365.83 367.50 A: mhm 

366.42 369.06 B: mean that that was a huge scandal 

368.11 373.35 A: yeah yeah that was and the whole thing kind of fell apart too there you know 

373.63 378.71 B: yeah and i would like to believe that you know president bush is a good enough person that he would be 

378.83 383.92 B: putting putting good people in charge of making these decisions too 

383.79 384.93 A: mhm 

384.02 393.43 B: you know to oversee these boards and things but it seems like some of the people that he's appointed have themself had problems from that have come out in their backgrounds 

392.77 394.30 A: mhm 

393.67 397.60 B: you know where they shouldn't really be sitting in positions to judge other 

398.20 401.09 B: leaders of other companies for the things that they're doing 

400.73 401.82 A: mhm 

401.21 404.72 B: because they themselves have had some shenanigans in the past 

404.39 408.84 A: yeah well he president bush himself had a little trouble i heard too so 

408.61 413.63 B: yeah i'm not real sure of what what his things were as far as financial dealings 

409.27 410.27 A: (( you know )) 

413.14 421.79 A: i'm not exactly sure either but they said he wasn't entirely you know clean [laughter] that he has done some thing that were suspect so 

418.56 419.60 B: yeah 

421.77 428.27 B: yeah i mostly i've heard more of of chaney you know and his involvements with halliberton and and things like that 

427.69 428.90 A: mhm 

428.85 434.24 B: so i i try to pay attention to it but it just seems like it's so overwhelming that there's so much 

434.63 437.39 B: you know there's so much um questionable stuff 

437.54 439.79 A: yeah yeah there is 

437.77 441.93 B: [laughter] that you just you don't know how to keep track of it all and 

440.88 442.91 A: no you really don't 

442.84 449.47 B: i think that it's causing a lot of people that maybe have already retired and are looking at some things now and are saying 

449.73 452.80 B: well maybe maybe i shouldn't have retired 

452.60 454.49 A: mhm mhm 

453.52 459.79 B: but then i guess if the more people that can move on they create an opening then hopefully they could bring on a younger person 

459.55 460.67 A: mhm 

460.15 462.58 B: you know to employ another person so 

463.19 463.90 A: (( mm )) 

463.95 468.02 B: i'll let you give a little more 'cause i've been i've been shooting off my opinion 

467.64 473.73 A: well [laughter] i'm not you know as knowledgeable as you are about the subject 'cause i don't read 

473.95 480.92 A: ah the paper every day and i don't know you know it upsets me personally to think that all these things are going on 

481.25 483.55 A: but i really don't know how it 

483.90 487.86 A: change you know how to change it or or what should be done 

488.34 497.35 B: yeah i felt that the union pressure on american airlines was a good thing i've never really been one that has said i think that unions are so great but 

496.69 497.91 A: mhm 

497.29 504.76 B: i feel that that because they are organized they've been able to put pressure and and cause something like that to be done 

504.74 508.79 A: yeah that really that did work out well you're right that was a good thing 

509.23 517.75 B: and my husband was kind of saying well i mean he's not in a union but we could do the same thing well how would you organize it well just pass the word well 

517.78 521.09 B: i don't think it would be that easy you know unless you 

519.81 520.57 A: (( uh-uh )) 

521.18 526.13 B: have a network of of say through email and communication to say that 

526.15 536.56 B: you were going to have a walk off the job to protest because the president of his company just got a huge ah bonus you know even though the company has lost money 

536.26 537.50 A: mhm 

537.53 541.27 B: so i mean if you wanted to protest that as an individual 

541.33 545.68 B: i suppose you could write a letter to the president of the company and 

545.94 552.01 B: you know and voice your opinion but then you're also in a position where maybe you'd get fired because of it 

551.50 554.14 A: yeah that's true mhm 

553.52 559.88 B: or watched more closely but at least as a union you've got that protection of the whole group of you 

559.63 561.31 A: mhm mhm 

560.17 563.58 B: you know standing up for something like that so 

562.96 567.93 A: yeah and it's official they can vote and they have official results so you know 

567.10 568.20 B: right 

568.40 573.66 A: yeah that does work well but unfortunately not everyone has unions you know so 

573.52 574.58 B: yeah 

574.94 578.43 B: i think it's cutting deep into the fabric though this cheating and 

578.46 586.33 B: i mean if if people are just not going to have any faith in our stock market it's not only going to affect us as americans but as foreign investors too 

586.03 588.01 A: mhm mhm 

586.82 593.77 B: that are looking at this and saying well we can put our money in other places where possibly we we don't have to deal with all this 

593.79 595.38 B: corruption and 

595.34 597.20 A: yeah mhm 

596.89 599.95 B: and all these investigations are not only
