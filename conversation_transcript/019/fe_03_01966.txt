66.74 67.39 B: (( yes )) 

68.18 70.79 A: gosh so corporate scandals let's see 

71.13 78.50 A: let me think of some of the most recent ones um [sigh] how about all the the c._e._o.s accepting 

78.44 82.18 B: oh all this the way they the new way they pocket their money 

81.79 88.10 A: right right and all the stock that's been put underneath the table um 

83.14 83.89 B: mm 

87.19 88.23 B: right 

88.15 91.83 A: and people cashing in and making millions of dollars 

91.49 96.13 B: i know and it affects me because i'm a graduating senior from college 

94.89 95.84 A: okay 

96.54 97.80 B: and 

98.44 105.41 B: i've seen all the kids who are i'm not um a business major but all the kids who would have went to those fields 

105.67 108.20 B: are now coming into like um 

108.73 113.43 B: more like non profit sector type work of which i would have gone into 

113.04 113.98 A: uh-huh 

113.74 119.17 B: and so now the job market for the jobs i would like teaching um peace corps 

119.52 121.06 B: all the 

121.14 123.61 B: i guess what people call crunchy jobs 

123.75 124.66 A: mhm 

123.90 128.98 B: um are being swarmed by these kids who are getting turned away from corporate america 

128.80 129.99 A: oh wow 

129.22 131.91 B: because they're not they're not they're just not hiring 

132.02 145.20 B: um because these kids really are taught for four years how to sell themselves how to like put themselves out there no matter what if they know how to do it or not they are getting all these jobs and getting into teaching america they are getting into the peace corps they're getting they're becoming 

145.22 151.69 B: like usually you know anyone could go in the peace corps you just have to be willing and able and now it's just such a 

149.89 151.27 A: right 

151.93 161.49 B: it's such a process you used to be in line and you know into these programmes and teach for america they were dying for people to to just apply and now they have too many applicants so i think 

161.62 169.58 B: in that respect it's it's i'm dealing with it because i'm dealing with ah a more competitive job market it's like come out of school 

169.49 183.59 B: um and i came into school in nineteen ninety nine boom of the economy everyone is still doing really well um you know computer stocks were still out- outrageous you know going into into this like yeah i can 

183.48 185.96 B: do really well in the um 

186.37 188.45 B: (( in the helping industry )) 

188.21 189.18 A: right 

189.04 195.85 B: as everyone else goes off into you know wall street and here i am and i'm at an i._d. as teacher and um 

196.03 209.22 B: my the school i go to i go to school i go to the university of pennsylvania and have laughton business school no more on the graduate business school and so i'm like sitting next to the most competitive people in the world [laughter] and there they are taking my job as a teacher 

205.43 206.51 A: (( right )) 

207.95 209.08 A: [laughter] 

209.41 213.97 B: so that's the way i'm feeling it i'm feeling it that that way 

213.34 215.29 A: (( that's interesting for me 'cause like )) 

214.39 215.12 B: (( yes )) 

215.78 223.24 A: you're in school and i'm in the corporate world and i think i feel in in some respects the same way because um 

223.20 227.60 A: let's see i worked for the dot com industry during the dot com boom 

227.54 241.78 A: and um you know we were building web sites for companies like walgreens and you know really big companies are paying big money to have to have their an internet presence and to have the same look and feel on the internet that they did in their in their stores 

241.77 249.74 A: and right about the time that the dot com industry fell that's when you had all these corporate scandals 

249.40 250.76 B: (( right mm mm )) 

249.70 256.98 A: um start happening and i think that really contributed to um the dot com industry failing 

257.03 258.45 A: as hard as it did 

258.43 267.40 A: i think if you wouldn't have had all those scandals um the dot com industry at least probably more of the dot com industry would have been able to survive 

267.28 278.83 A: and as a result i mean everybody pretty much everyone that i knew in the dot com industry got laid off you know companies went bankrupt my company went bankrupt ah people got laid off and all of a sudden you had this glut 

278.79 282.72 A: of technical people um that needed jobs in the market 

282.83 284.07 A: and um 

284.30 286.56 A: i was actually off work for about i 

286.70 289.34 A: guess probably three or four months 

289.25 299.25 A: um which was actually ended up being good timing because i had had just had a baby so um i was able to stay home you know a little longer than i had anticipated um but when i came back to work 

299.17 311.16 A: um you know working for a company that makes um who makes ah testers for for chips for companies like intel and motorola that put computer chips into their you know their telephones and their computers 

311.09 315.44 A: and i'm an information security professional and um 

315.59 320.29 A: so i you know do all the technical and procedural stuff on how to secure information assets 

320.37 332.63 A: but our company um i think is still in some respects reeling from the scandals as well as the the you know the fall of the dot com industry you know our stock prices are still low 

332.64 333.74 A: um 

333.84 342.25 A: you know as a result um when i signed up my options were really high um so my my stock options for signing up you know are worth nothing now 

342.26 353.61 A: um the good news is that as we get stock incentives and stock bonus you know now we're getting the lower prices um but i mean definitely definitely it's affected ah 

353.73 357.02 A: i think the whole corporate world as a whole 

358.69 361.53 B: let's say i think it's also funny is that um 

362.81 369.84 B: people as you mentioned the dot com fall i think that people really weren't asking questions and asking 

369.87 382.38 B: in like i remember the hot question was where is all this money coming from and how when when are we going to see you know when these companies are actually going to make money like everyone was asking where is you 

374.15 375.28 A: mhm 

382.42 383.43 B: (( know )) 

383.66 387.00 B: where is it like where where is the money that it's earning 

387.01 388.07 B: um 

388.31 393.12 B: that because we have the stock that's worth all this stuff but like where's where's your output 

390.85 391.87 A: right 

393.04 403.95 B: and i think that maybe as you as you're bringing it up i'm thinking that maybe that might be the callous looms other to other sectors other industries like yeah where's yours too [laughter] 

403.46 416.70 A: right we think about all the millions of dollars that was spent you know to get an internet presence and and you think about all the scandals and even some of the the scandals that didn't come out you know i think about people that were in my company that were 

404.25 405.49 B: (( mhm )) 

407.28 408.58 B: mhm 

416.62 427.84 A: like um just you know gurus you know that you you pay top dollar for them and they they abused um their privileges you know i knew one guy that worked out of california and um 

428.04 428.91 A: he 

428.98 431.08 A: he expensed um suits 

431.09 439.00 A: you know to the company because he was just you know he was so good the company didn't want to lose him and so they they did things like that 

438.94 447.82 A: and i think that you know doing things like that you know it started at the bottom but it starts at the bottom and and it gets approved you know it goes all the way to the top the corruption 

446.73 452.14 B: i think almost it's like a culture it's like that's that's how you're supposed to behave 

452.22 462.47 B: and i think it's an idea that people have that that's what you're pos- supposed to do so that i think i think i think what happens is a lot of people come into these positions newly 

462.62 465.32 B: behave that way and then it 

465.41 473.85 B: it kind of backfires on you like i know here at school like the culture the the idea that people at college think they're going to behave in their 

474.04 475.66 B: in their next job 

475.71 480.60 B: and they're so out of touch with reality i'm not in the business i'm not looking people like 

480.78 493.83 B: do you really think it's going to be like that like [laughter] do you really think you are going to have like this grey like right out of college like all this you know all these beautiful things that you know it's not going to be what world are you living in what t._v. show are you watching what loser is watching 

492.60 494.33 A: right 

493.99 494.92 B: um 

495.20 497.37 B: i think that's interesting how people 

497.39 500.81 B: how like it gets feed it gets fed back to us 

500.87 515.61 B: like these myths of how you are supposed to behave in the corporate sector and then and you do it and it all backfires on you and you just and then your excuse is well you know this is how everyone does it and this really isn't how everyone does it it's how you are doing it um and absolute messes it all up right 

503.74 504.70 A: right 

511.99 512.90 A: right 

514.93 517.86 A: and i i think of that too like how it affected our company 

517.83 531.91 A: price waterhouse does our does our um financial auditing but they also come in and they do contract technical work for us well we can't we can't contract with price waterhouse any more on the technical audits because we have to keep them separate now 

529.59 530.35 B: (( right right )) 

532.12 537.25 A: so that's you know definitely a way you know another way that it's that it's been affected 

537.33 543.06 A: but then on the positive side i look at my company and [cough] i look at 

543.16 547.19 A: when all this happened i think they did all the right things you know they immediately said 

547.13 556.90 A: you know they they they um disclosed their accounting practices they separated themselves from you know financial and technical audits um 

556.84 564.37 A: [cough] one of the things i really like about the company too is they actually do a lot of um we do a lot of volunteer work around the around the boston area because i live in boston 

564.51 565.48 A: um 

565.74 571.02 A: and i i like that i wish more companies would do that 'cause i think that would help alleviate some of the 

571.17 572.67 A: some of the um 

572.98 575.65 A: you know stuff that we're still seeing you know some of the 

575.80 582.02 A: you know that we're still seeing the negative stuff from from all those scandals i think our company's more proactive 

579.28 581.00 B: but i've seen 

581.82 588.06 B: yeah what i've seen coming up here it's as they are students are proposing classes on corporate ethics 

588.07 589.15 A: really 

589.45 595.36 B: yeah i was in a class full of students who were learning a proposal for um 

595.56 599.32 B: corporate ethics and civic responsibility 

599.27 599.89 A: wow 

599.41 599.89 B: in
