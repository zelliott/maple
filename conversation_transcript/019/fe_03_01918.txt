324.82 326.88 A: yeah

368.63 370.85 B: i'm like don't you get enough of it at work [laughter] 

369.93 383.76 A: off ah yeah yeah so there's some people at work that's all basically all they do is is watch the news and everything and i i just don't see how love it well it's like right now my kids are watching nickelodeon so that's about all i get to watch 

381.74 382.76 B: mhm 

383.36 385.87 B: yeah [laughter] they control the viewing 

385.45 392.41 A: they pretty much do ye- although they have one in their room too they're just kind of back and forth and i just kind of relax 

392.49 402.32 B: our newspapers actually slowed down some on it now there's all budget cuts and people being laid off for this that and the other taxes all that stuff [laughter] 

400.88 404.16 A: yep well same thing here 

404.88 408.00 B: i go to the university and that's kind of a mess right now 

408.49 410.03 B: i guess the um 

411.27 416.94 B: president said that they were going to have to get rid of some tenured faculty and that's really caused enough horror 

416.65 417.94 A: (( oh )) 

418.61 419.89 B: i don't know in what program 

419.83 423.19 A: (( oh yeah that's going to ruffle a few feathers there )) 

422.09 427.14 B: yep and then i heard something about a fifteen percent or twenty five percent tuition hike 

427.84 430.51 B: [laughter] and it already went up about 

431.14 433.58 B: ten or fifteen percent this year 

434.06 436.04 B: so i'm glad i only have one year left but 

437.91 439.30 B: that is unless 

440.57 444.84 A: [laughter] 

441.13 445.91 B: and they already have it with where the out of state tuition is just outrageous 

446.55 448.88 B: and now the in state's getting that way 

446.64 449.55 A: yeah 

450.70 456.17 A: well that's just i guess ah i know one thing everybody's looking at here in north carolina is 

456.44 461.06 A: trying to follow south carolina's example where they've got a just started a lottery 

460.69 461.55 B: (( mm )) 

462.13 465.60 A: yep so they ah a lot of the tuition is paid for 

466.23 473.43 A: pretty much they're trying to get it to where if you maintain a a c. average you don't pay for school you pay for college all the way through 

471.11 472.17 B: (( wow i was )) 

473.84 478.00 A: and here in north carolina they are fighting the lottery 'cause they don't want a lottery 

476.97 480.21 B: going to say i think they were fighting it here a couple of years ago 

479.88 482.71 A: yeah 

481.18 484.13 B: then everyone said that everyone's running to iowa 

484.38 485.28 A: uh-huh 

484.60 487.86 B: and doing it there so we might as well have it here [laughter] 

487.44 496.69 A: well that's it around us well we've got tennessee that's got it virginia's got it and south carolina so there's pretty much all the states around us have it 

497.16 502.86 A: and we said what are we waiting for why are we sending a lot of our money somewhere else we might as well leave it here 

502.29 505.15 B: yeah that's what they said here and then i think they dropped it 

505.49 507.10 B: i haven't seen anything about that but 

506.93 510.74 A: yeah well i think our i think our governor is now pushing for it so 

511.33 513.37 A: yeah that's one of my concerns is 

513.79 520.54 A: trying to pay for college later on with the with the kids and i've tried to start saving but it's 

517.15 518.65 B: (( well yeah )) 

520.72 527.57 A: just a little bit i'm saving and seeing all the costs going up i'm not sure how i'll be able to afford that much 

525.49 527.73 B: yeah outrageous every year 

529.04 530.05 A: (( yeah and i )) 

530.14 536.23 A: i guess when they fi- were first born i said well i've got eighteen years to save for it well now i've got like eleven 

534.63 535.42 B: right 

535.95 537.22 B: yep [laughter] 

537.99 540.17 B: it'll be here before you know it 

539.77 544.64 A: and then both of them are going to hit hit at about the same time there's only like two years' difference 

544.06 547.39 B: yeah yeah that can really 

547.84 549.19 B: be hard 

548.33 551.44 A: yep so i'm either hoping one of them or 

551.47 556.30 A: or both are really good athletes and can get scholarships or really really smart 

556.00 556.91 B: yeah 

558.30 561.71 B: yeah scholarships definitely help i couldn't have done it without it 

561.03 564.21 A: (( or yeah [mn] i'm )) 

564.55 573.75 A: afraid i'll be just like my parents where they they were able to put me through the first year and after that i had the co-op i pretty much paid for my school 

571.27 572.52 B: mhm 

574.83 576.05 A: but then ah 

576.27 579.12 A: it was difficult it took me like a year longer 

578.85 579.84 B: yeah 

579.21 583.49 A: to go and but i did come out and only owe about two thousand dollars 

582.82 584.21 B: wow wow that's great 

585.08 590.24 A: but ah yeah i- i'd like to be able to pay for theirs but i just don't see i don't see how 

589.92 590.86 B: yeah 

591.34 594.19 B: yeah my husband's still paying off some of his stuff 

593.82 595.28 A: yeah 

595.11 598.58 B: he started out as a meteorology major with a 

598.78 599.90 B: journalism minor
