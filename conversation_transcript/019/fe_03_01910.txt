0.20 2.20 A: (( hi i'm therese mccracken )) 

1.68 3.73 B: i'm wendy how are you doing 

3.33 4.62 A: fine how are you 

4.15 5.24 B: good 

5.21 7.08 A: uh do you have any children 

7.08 9.36 B: no i'm still only twenty four 

8.75 13.59 A: oh okay well uh then what does family mean to you at th- at that age then 

13.31 19.18 B: well i think it just means you know people who love and support you and will always be there for you no matter what 

19.43 24.91 A: that that sounds good um i have a four children and a husband and um 

25.06 32.50 A: i think my opinion of family that there's many different families as far as we have a church family that we're very 

32.63 40.11 A: involved with and fond of and uh our view of family on the our inner circle of our fo- or our six 

40.10 53.50 A: is supporting and loving each other like [noise] like what you've said and um but with being a parent also it's part of the discipline thing and trying to get your children to do to do what's right even when it's hard and uh 

53.90 56.80 A: i'm very grateful for my family a lot of times 

57.00 59.73 A: i get stressed out and challenged but i 

59.92 62.19 A: think that's part of being a mom also 

61.45 75.53 B: [laughter] definitely and like you said a family you know doesn't necessarily have to mean biology it's just anyone who's you know really close to you and gives you that love and support it doesn't have to be you know someone who you're related to 

75.19 79.36 A: [noise] yeah it makes me think of when i worked and um 

80.00 86.58 A: then it it was it was a family in that point of view even though we wasn't blood related uh 

86.84 90.15 A: you knew about everybody and what was going on and that 

90.72 98.63 A: actually my goodyear family because i worked at goodyear and was um you know you were affected [noise] by what affected them [noise] and you hated 

98.68 110.14 A: to hear of their sorrows and you rejoiced with them when there was happiness and so and and that's the same way with the church family also and it it's amazing how many different families you can have because then you also have your 

110.22 116.19 A: your mom and your dad and your sisters and brothers and all the ones nieces and nephews you care for 

115.91 117.52 B: mhm mm definitely 

117.18 119.11 A: and so that's um 

119.48 127.44 A: it's amazing when you actually think about it and and i i tend to take it for granted and now just sitting here and talking with you about it 

127.48 137.56 B: yeah i mean i think everybody takes it for granted until you know that day comes along when they really need you know someone to be there for them and and then it's a family member and they realize how important they are 

137.17 144.06 A: yeah well i think you know it makes me think about the the m- the war [noise] that's going on with iraq and how uh there's many 

144.17 152.99 A: mothers and fathers [noise] that are over there and family back here missing them and we are so blessed uh that we you know myself didn't go 

149.31 150.62 B: (( mm definitely )) 

153.32 156.51 A: my brother may end up going still even though 

156.52 169.36 A: the war's [noise] potentially over and the separation is really hard but i think that also if it's a real strong family it'll pull you closer together with just know that you know that support system is there 

158.54 159.56 B: mhm 

165.75 166.64 B: yeah 

169.26 170.46 B: definitely 

170.76 173.54 A: [noise] and do you have any brothers and sisters 

172.93 175.27 B: i have one brother he's an older brother 

174.98 177.17 A: is he are you close to him [noise] 

176.24 179.38 B: yeah we've always been like very close and 

179.42 187.06 B: you know i always idolized him growing up and you know now that we're both adults you know we're we help each other out and we're just close like that 

186.51 188.06 A: oh is he married 

187.44 188.57 B: yes 

188.13 195.80 A: so see yeah and that's probably just another extension [noise] of family as far as his wife and children and does he have any kids 

193.13 194.44 B: oh yeah 

195.80 198.16 B: no they just got married recently 

195.89 197.07 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

197.50 208.25 A: well well see then you're looking forward to nieces and nephews and [laughter] spoil these young 'uns yeah and that's i have got a sister in florida and well i'm from north carolina i don't even know where you're from 

199.93 202.10 B: (( [laughter] definitely [laughter] )) 

207.64 208.82 B: new york 

208.60 210.28 A: oh okay [noise] and um 

210.56 217.45 A: i don't get to see her that often and so it it does i call here quite often and just to be able to talk with her she's got five children 

216.89 218.15 B: wow mm 

217.33 225.76 A: and uh so it's you get to hear each one about each one and it it's just you know you love 'em so much and hate to be so far away from 'em 

224.91 225.83 B: (( mm )) 

226.22 229.36 A: [noise] and then with uh i've got all my other 

229.39 239.09 A: other family here with as far as my mother and i've got two brothers and uh two sisters and so i'm closer to all my other nephews and nieces [noise] and uh 

239.03 246.31 A: it is it's precious we almo- we almost all of us go to the same church [noise] and so that that brings another closeness [noise] 

246.56 247.73 A: and so we 

248.02 249.51 A: (( all i know is i'd been depressed )) 

250.11 253.58 A: just to have the you know just uh you d- when you're 

253.77 256.05 A: getting to the point where you are 

256.39 261.48 A: don't know where to go it's nice to be able to turn to family that care about ya and love ya anyway 

261.13 262.16 B: right 

261.51 270.20 A: they can look past you know your faults and say you know i'm here for ya [noise] and i'll care of your needs or i'll support you with whatever you decide so 

270.50 272.17 A: that's [noise] that's a good thing 

271.98 273.23 B: yeah 

274.04 280.95 B: yeah like even when i went away to college and i didn't have my family around there you know your friends that you live with they become your family and 

274.08 274.64 A: (( [noise] ))

289.75 296.97 A: oh okay [noise] yeah and that's [noise] you know any i think any time that you have that close sort of relationship where you're talking to them every day and 

296.90 310.04 A: you're spending time with them and eating meals and cleaning up after each other and all the w- all the things that go with living together it it is it's uh so personalized and if you get along with 'em or you don't get along with them 

310.33 316.08 A: and it well the thing with with family you don't get to choose you do choose your friends but you can't choose family and 

312.74 314.09 B: [laughter] 

315.47 316.69 B: [laughter] 

316.10 323.97 A: even if you get along with them or not you're still in that situation so hopefully as you mature it it gets better 

323.42 325.29 B: right you learn to get along with them 

324.89 332.96 A: yeah it wa- i grew up with uh i have a twin and then my other two older siblings and then i have a younger sibling that's ten years younger 

327.29 327.85 B: (( [mn] ))

335.71 336.65 B: (( mm )) 

337.99 346.91 A: as we became teenagers we were further apart but as we became adults because we're all in our thirties now except for the younger sibling um 

347.04 350.12 A: we have a good relationship where i can call each one and 

350.13 356.99 A: share with them and they share with me and it's it's a better relationship and i'm grateful that you can get to that age where you 

357.02 360.45 A: no longer get upset [noise] about every little thing and you know you 

360.46 366.20 A: you've matured enough that you know the bad things even though they are bad you can get through 'em 

365.95 367.30 B: right 

366.72 368.26 A: and be supportive 

368.64 371.41 A: and then we have to have a dog that's part of our family 

370.94 374.17 B: oh that's true i forgot i didn't even think about that [laughter] 

373.36 379.16 A: yeah well you know for a lot of families my my dad and his wife uh they have 

379.32 380.98 A: three dogs and

407.57 408.47 B: (( mm )) 

409.80 411.16 B: [laughter]

422.22 425.94 A: and they love the older ones but they can't hold them on their knee any more so

427.32 431.68 A: amazing to see how families change and mature and um 

432.48 434.45 A: we had moved away for a year

443.30 444.12 B: (( mm )) 

443.45 457.25 A: as far as height and uh i'm like it's just amazing 'cause life doesn't stop [noise] just because i'm not here and you would you would love to think that everything stopped at home until you get back and that's just not the case but
