11.41 15.23 B: well i'm new to it too this is my first call but um 

15.44 18.39 B: the topic was corporate america 

19.65 22.00 A: which i think is a mess right now 

22.05 29.25 B: yes i would have to agree and ah one of the things they said towards the end is how how their conduct has affected you 

29.57 33.48 B: and um i used to work for m._c._i. worldcom 

34.06 35.04 B: so 

35.13 41.77 B: the conduct of the people that are involved in that has affected me greatly since i was laid off last year [laughter] 

40.79 44.87 A: [noise] yeah that would i know ah my husband is a truck driver and 

44.95 46.33 A: the way the econom- 

46.78 48.99 A: whether he's going to 

49.13 51.01 A: have freight to haul or not 

50.86 52.36 B: right right 

52.67 59.81 B: well personally i mean my friends and i have been talking a lot about ah you know how we were brought up is 

60.00 70.66 B: you know you go to work for a company and you work hard and you're honest and you're devoted to them and that they're gonna take care of you in the end and and those days just seem to be gone 

70.61 71.91 A: yes they do 

71.71 82.50 B: you know you get laid off and your your 401k isn't worth anything because your stock is now worth nothing so you have no retirement and you have no job 

82.84 90.31 A: and i think before everybody was kind of loyal to the company that they was with it was kind of like you know more like a family 

90.00 92.10 B: exactly exactly 

90.93 94.03 A: anymore it's everybody's out for themselves 

93.42 99.05 B: yeah yep and when your leaders are are taking advantage of 

97.86 98.85 A: [noise] 

99.71 100.86 A: no you don't 

99.75 100.83 B: people 

101.50 104.01 A: sorry i had a five year old come talk to me [laughter] 

103.39 104.34 B: that's okay 

104.58 110.55 B: um yeah when the leaders are you can't trust them and they're you know it seems like they're just trying to 

110.80 115.00 B: suck the blood and money out of the company and then leave everybody 

115.08 116.00 B: hanging 

116.04 117.02 A: yes 

116.45 119.82 B: you know you can't you feel like you can't trust anybody anymore 

119.68 121.65 A: no that's the way i feel 

121.37 122.56 B: mhm 

122.16 131.63 A: they're out for what they can get and they don't care about their workers it goes both ways the workers don't care about the company and the management don't care about the workers 

131.27 132.33 B: (( yeah )) 

132.39 140.56 B: yep that's ah you know i mean bernie eberds is sitting there getting paid a a million and a half a year to not come to work you know 

140.87 142.18 B: um he's not 

141.13 142.81 A: i'd like that but 

142.40 147.35 B: yeah i don't go to work and they're not sending me my check for a million and a half a year [laughter] 

142.90 143.68 A: [laughter] 

146.89 150.26 A: no we don't go to work we don't get a pay check 

149.68 151.76 B: that's right that's right and 

151.87 155.98 B: i was just talking to another friend of mine he used to be a flight attendant 

155.99 160.21 B: and apparently the ah was it american airlines 

159.54 161.02 A: i think that's the one 

160.99 167.04 B: they all the employees just agreed to take a pay cut to keep their jobs and keep the company afloat 

167.14 170.67 B: and um all the executives got a um 

170.89 176.89 B: retention bonus and it equaled the same amount that the employees agreed not to take 

177.42 183.69 B: so all the management and all the executives got bonuses and the employees all took a cut in pay 

184.01 186.46 B: now that doesn't make any kind of sense 

185.83 192.99 A: no that makes absolutely not sense to me i think if the employees have to have a cut management should have a cut too 

192.82 196.20 B: right right but the employees did it to keep their jobs 

196.96 201.57 B: you know and management once again has taken advantage of the situation 

203.15 207.11 B: so my faith in big companies and 

207.13 210.34 B: having them take care of me is completely shot 

210.50 211.67 A: mine too 

212.08 213.39 A: it really is 

214.20 217.08 A: it seems like you can trust anybody anymore 

214.22 215.15 B: so 

217.06 218.00 B: no 

218.12 224.03 B: well i don't i trust people individuals people i can talk to face to face 

223.38 224.36 A: yes 

224.17 225.56 B: and um 

226.16 235.01 B: you know i still have that faith but you know as far as putting my heart and soul into a company again i don't think i can do it well 

234.95 238.31 A: no that's hard to do because you never know what they're going to do to you 

238.56 241.10 A: they don't care about the individual anymore 

240.69 242.65 B: that's right that's right 

242.73 250.83 B: pay you as little as they possibly can and get as much out of you and screw you in the end if it suits their purpose 

250.47 253.85 A: yep they they expect you to work for nothing 

253.91 258.78 A: and be at their beck and call if they want you to work overtime you need to be there 

255.51 256.66 B: that's right 

258.46 259.56 B: that's right 

260.06 262.28 A: you're not supposed to have a private life 

261.77 263.44 B: right right 

264.28 269.12 B: well those days are gone for me i'm gonna try to figure out another way to 

269.15 270.36 B: make a living 

270.91 273.10 B: i've got three kids at home so 

273.76 274.68 B: (( [mn] )) 

274.41 278.18 A: i do too i'm raising three grandkids so 

277.88 279.11 B: yeah 

278.49 279.41 A: it's 

279.54 281.87 A: starting over for me and it's 

282.99 285.34 A: i don't don't envy them 

285.50 287.85 A: growing up in this world i really don't 

287.88 293.68 B: yeah it's tough it's tough to know what to teach them you know you want to teach them honesty and integrity but 

293.83 299.02 B: everybody around takes advantage of those qualities it seems like you know 

298.30 303.82 A: yep you want them to teach them that but on the same hand you want to teach them 

303.86 305.52 A: to protect themselves 

305.02 306.51 B: watch your back 

306.05 307.05 A: yes 

306.67 309.15 B: [laughter] yeah it's tough 

309.67 314.86 A: because you never know what your boss is gonna do be loyal to your boss but watch him at the same time 

314.48 317.91 B: right right people in general i think 

317.55 318.51 A: yes 

318.09 319.18 B: anymore 

320.18 321.51 B: so where are you 

321.41 322.67 A: i'm in utah 

322.47 324.40 B: oh in utah i'm in colorado 

324.27 326.25 A: oh we're not too far apart then 

325.95 327.09 B: no 

327.37 329.43 B: we had some snow yesterday 

327.43 328.01 A: (( [noise] )) 

330.25 332.30 A: we had a nice day yesterday 

332.74 334.69 A: it's a little windy today but 

335.12 336.71 A: not too bad 

336.11 337.31 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

338.60 342.24 B: well we got ten more minutes or ten minutes total 

342.97 345.68 A: it's hard to think of something to say for that long 

345.59 346.68 B: (( [laughter] )) 

347.11 348.06 B: well 

349.04 353.37 B: i think i'd like to figure out a business i could start on my own so i'm only 

353.74 360.84 B: you know i only i'm only accountable to myself and my conscience is my guide and i don't you know 

360.89 364.03 B: i don't have to worry about being screwed you know what i mean 

363.58 364.92 A: yes i do 

365.56 366.51 B: so 

366.05 372.07 A: but i think in this time it's hard to start your own business because everybody's out to run you out of business 

372.07 374.98 B: yeah if you unless you can find a niche 

375.02 376.05 B: um 

376.77 377.62 B: (( you know )) 

377.84 390.54 B: something i'd like something i can do from home 'cause my kids are are in school and daycare is so expensive that you know with the the economy the way it is i can't afford to go back to work and pay daycare 

392.95 396.17 A: see it even it's the trickle effect it even affects 

396.21 397.76 A: people in daycare 

397.85 398.96 B: oh i know 

398.55 403.56 A: everything has to be you know they have to raise their prices for childcare because everything else is 

403.95 405.32 A: (( outrageous )) 

404.91 405.81 B: right 

405.71 408.66 A: so it doesn't make it worth your while to go to work anymore 

408.45 418.95 B: it doesn't um you know that's why finding something something part time you know that you could do from home that allows you to still be with your kids 

419.28 422.52 B: is is what i'm trying to come up with 

422.00 424.29 A: then you'd have a boss you could trust 

423.59 426.17 B: [laughter] most of the time 

425.81 427.25 A: [laughter] 

427.29 429.41 B: unless i'm having a crazy day [laughter] 

429.42 431.54 A: oh i think we all have those

457.12 458.09 B: wow 

458.63 460.33 A: so i don't 

461.05 464.45 A: i don't envy them having to grow up in this world and 

465.09 467.53 A: going into the business you know into the 

468.46 469.78 B: the workforce 

468.81 472.99 A: workforce that's the word i was trying to think of because that's gonna be hard on them 

472.79 473.80 B: yeah 

474.28 475.41 B: yep 

474.93 479.06 A: if there's even one when they grow up the way things are going you never know

489.19 494.56 B: but there's people with masters degrees working at mcdonald's 'cause that's the only thing they can find right now 

494.87 496.70 A: it it's crazy 

496.76 497.71 B: yeah 

497.36 503.42 A: some of the big businesses that you though would never in your lifetime go out of business are out 

503.26 504.28 B: right 

504.71 506.19 A: and it's like okay 

506.26 508.18 A: this is getting scary
