20.82 23.45 A: tell you a little bit about my family [lipsmack] um 

24.48 28.65 A: my family is actually kinda twisted a little bit because i ah 

29.06 33.83 A: was growing up and somewhere along the ah i was in kindergarten 

34.19 41.07 A: my parents got divorced ended up going to live with my dad and somewhere after that i ended up living with my aunts 

41.08 43.25 A: and i grew up with them pretty much ah 

43.46 46.27 A: (( you know until i graduated until i went to college )) 

46.54 47.52 B: mhm 

46.83 50.16 A: and so that was kinda interesting so it's 

50.43 54.22 A: really they played the mother role in my 

54.26 56.38 A: you know in my life i guess 

56.47 59.06 B: [noise] so you're you're an only child

75.03 82.79 A: i grew up with my two of my sisters and my brother my other sister for some odd reason went to 

83.10 85.36 A: um stay with my mother 

85.37 86.01 B: (( mm )) 

85.92 87.53 A: so that's pretty bizarre 

87.71 98.25 A: cause ah we we actually grew up very differently like completely different ah like goals and you know we went to college she didn't all that kind of stuff 

98.54 99.71 B: (( [noise] [noise] so )) 

98.59 101.67 A: (( how how about your family ))

108.29 109.52 A: oh really 

109.35 110.95 B: so um 

111.00 112.44 B: we grew up in 

112.56 113.84 B: a really 

114.46 115.76 B: strange 

115.77 122.31 B: strange lifestyle we we're from korea actually and my parents are jewish 

117.45 118.34 A: okay 

122.27 123.48 A: okay wow 

122.89 125.06 B: so [laughter] we were um 

125.21 127.96 B: kinda thrown into this really 

128.27 129.43 B: weird 

130.32 135.27 B: clash of culture and and there's a lot of 

135.71 137.82 B: prejudice as far as 

138.54 143.43 B: in my own family i have i have really strong ideas 

140.14 140.96 A: it's 

143.81 150.65 B: about what's important and what should be number one priority among families 

151.90 158.02 A: mm that's so is the prejudice from like just a lot of people the jewish faith um 

152.46 153.22 B: so 

158.27 161.09 A: weren't as open in accepting or 

161.30 172.33 B: um i'm i'm not sure if the religion had much to had much of a major role in it but i i remember that a lot of my my grandparents 

165.54 166.47 A: okay 

172.69 173.61 B: um 

174.06 176.03 B: well a few from 

176.10 179.77 B: my mom mom one from my mom's side and 

179.79 184.06 B: both from my father's side were from orthodox 

184.13 186.62 A: okay they were very strict right 

184.86 189.91 B: upbringing yeah so and i remember that my grandfather 

190.12 191.85 B: refused to 

192.81 201.51 B: refused to take part in certain activities that that my sister and i did because we belonged to the reformed temple and you couldn't convert 

201.52 209.54 B: in the conservative orthodox and he refused to visit or to talk to my dad and they kinda severed all connections 

210.25 211.53 A: (( ahah wow that's )) 

210.39 211.26 B: so 

211.96 214.99 A: was do you have a big family though is it ah 

214.93 218.21 B: um it used to be but not any more my 

218.50 221.34 B: my mom's grandmother 

221.44 226.72 B: i'm sorry my mom's mother had ten brothers and sisters 

227.00 228.05 A: wow 

227.77 232.39 B: but they all passed away and they were 

232.47 235.48 B: i don't think they married so i don't have a lot 

235.81 237.98 B: of like second cousins or anything 

237.89 240.61 A: yeah ahah our family is pretty small too we um 

241.47 243.15 A: it seems that ah 

243.14 245.35 A: outside of 

245.13 258.79 A: you know the immediate family brother sisters i don't really keep in touch haven't really met the aunts and uncles a lot of them are in different states and things like that but so it's kinda weird the reunions weddings things like that aren't the largest but um [mn] go 

256.30 257.06 B: (( ahah )) 

258.88 260.62 B: (( yeah so do you )) 

260.83 261.60 A: ahead 

261.05 262.44 B: i was going to ask you 

263.06 264.14 B: i guess 

264.51 268.28 B: do you have friends that are considered family 

269.10 270.22 A: um 

270.94 271.94 A: you know 

273.08 275.46 A: friends that are considered family well 

274.83 276.45 B: well i mean for me i 

276.50 279.64 B: i can say that i don't think blood is 

280.71 282.88 B: has anything to do with family 

283.19 284.91 A: i yeah i mean 

285.31 291.34 A: i i guess i completely believe that i mean i um i i don't can't say that i really have that 

291.26 306.18 A: i mean like my aunts for example um were like you know taking the part of my mother and i completely think of them in that respect anything that my mother would do or anything like that i'd look to them you know if somebody says mother i think of them 

306.40 316.31 A: so in some respect they weren't really my mothers but they played that role and i think ah they did just as well [laughter] 

306.47 307.10 B: mm 

314.50 315.30 B: (( [laughter] )) 

316.91 318.05 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

318.20 326.28 A: how did ah did you actually did you try to keep in touch with any of the ah culture from south korea or do 

326.41 330.03 A: you speak the language or were you exposed to that or 

329.45 334.07 B: um for a time i was on this little crusade trying to find my 

334.16 335.32 B: birth parents 

335.02 335.83 A: (( ahah )) 

335.39 341.02 B: and i always used imagine what i would do if i found them and they already had another 

341.20 347.60 B: another family and i had brothers and sisters and they didn't want any part of me would i get angry upset 

347.93 353.70 B: um i know that i would i would be pissed because i'd feel like 

354.03 354.86 B: i 

354.98 357.30 B: i was rejected in a way 

357.59 358.46 A: right 

357.64 360.09 B: but then i think that 

361.75 365.33 B: i think that it i was i definitely 

366.45 372.57 B: like living and growing up as a family in the united states than i would have in korea 

372.88 377.82 A: right so you weren't successful in finding out anything 

373.82 375.22 B: so 

376.92 379.10 B: no it got too expensive 

379.44 380.69 A: yeah 

380.30 384.26 B: and i realized that it really it it wasn't that important 

380.86 381.56 A: (( [noise] )) 

384.30 386.13 A: right 

384.74 385.68 B: to me 

386.64 390.84 A: so you um did you go away to school or anything how old are you are you 

390.79 392.61 B: oh i'm twenty three 

392.09 394.87 A: twenty three so are you going to college or 

394.66 396.96 B: i'm actually in grad school right now 

396.37 399.62 A: oh okay so do you keep in touch with your family a lot do you 

399.14 405.61 B: yes we're actually very close since um we're just an immediate family 

406.28 407.26 B: (( it's it's )) 

407.49 409.69 B: it's my guess we're 

410.78 412.44 B: we realize that 

412.78 415.92 B: when you have little family it's important to 

417.15 418.19 A: yeah that's 

417.61 418.92 B: to keep them close 

419.50 425.31 A: yeah that's how i wish my family would think actually it's kinda weird because we have a small family but everyone is pretty bad at keeping in touch 

425.69 427.89 A: and um it's kinda 

427.32 428.27 B: so you 

428.18 429.82 A: bizarre 

430.33 431.38 A: so 

430.36 433.30 B: do you keep in touch with your aunts 

431.93 437.67 A: so i i keep in touch with my aunts the most but my father for example he's not too far away yet 

437.47 447.17 A: and i feel like he should be taking more of an active role but he had remarried and ah had two other kids and i feel like he played father to them more so than he did with me 

440.99 441.56 B: (( [mn] )) 

447.80 455.08 A: um so it's kinda weird because it's like i'd like him to be more of a part of my life but i feel actually i still don't know if he 

448.34 449.47 B: (( i see )) 

455.22 463.60 A: understands you know that um you know that's important or he's just i don't know it just seems like 

463.56 464.67 B: so do you 

465.42 468.09 B: still have you i guess you haven't spoken that often 

468.31 470.24 A: well i mean actually you know 

470.91 474.78 A: i talk to him a fair amount or lately anyway because um 

474.71 486.45 A: you know my grandmother has actually been ill so it's his mother and so he that that tends to be bringing us together when we're visiting and things like that um but at the same time you know in terms of you know 

484.28 485.28 B: mhm 

486.44 495.16 A: picking up the phone calling saying hi how are you doing and that kinda thing those types of things don't happen unless i initiate and sometimes it's frustrating because you know he does it on the other hand to 

495.28 499.18 A: you know his kids with his second wife who actually he's 

499.25 501.43 A: divorced with him now too so [laughter] 

501.40 503.41 B: wow the guy has record 

501.71 506.00 A: i think he is through with the marriage concept at this point 

504.77 507.33 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

506.41 516.90 A: and in some sense that has kinda played with my mind because now that's like very important to me like i you know i just got married last year and i'm so thank you and um 

512.78 513.66 B: right 

514.00 515.75 B: oh congratulations 

517.15 529.24 A: you know it was so important to me to find somebody whose is like kind of a calm nice that somebody who i felt would have the values to not want to leave a relationship because i've just seen how much it can hurt a relationship mhm 

528.99 535.03 B: exactly my my my sister just got married last summer and um 

535.35 536.35 B: just 

537.18 541.42 B: [mn] however many times they've had arguments threatened to leave each other 

541.05 542.21 A: yeah 

541.57 551.73 B: it makes me feel that when people get married especially young young couples they don't really understand that you can't can't up and leave you 

546.72 547.43 A: (( ahah )) 

551.38 552.72 A: yeah it seems 

551.96 553.65 B: have to work things out 

552.95 563.55 A: like it seems too easy any more you know to [noise] for people to get up and leave which ah is kinda sad because you hear so many cases but 

564.40 565.29 A: (( you know )) 

564.66 573.27 B: yeah well i feel that like i guess it's not as bad if you don't have children that you need to split up [mn] 

572.80 579.77 A: right i i guess i agree with that i mean if you're totally miserable and you don't have kids and you know it makes sense to 

579.86 582.79 A: to not torture yourselves for the rest of your lives 

582.80 587.12 A: but when you have kids i i i guess it's the kinda the way i believe too i mean 

587.99 596.82 A: you really really i mean you have to try in all circumstances but i mean that's just the effects it can have on them just are you know 

597.08 598.81 A: you can't overlook that 

598.55 599.89 B: i'm sure you can understand
