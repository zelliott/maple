0.16 2.06 B: hi i'm lenora 

1.75 3.88 A: hi i'm ted 

3.40 7.66 B: hi ted i um this is a big broad topic today 

7.41 13.02 A: yes it is and they're asking like three questions in one it seems 

12.75 20.42 B: yes but i do think that um that the major corporations and all the scandal has a lot to do with our economy today 

21.09 24.00 B: because um a lot of money was lost 

25.00 28.08 B: through enron and some of the other big boys 

29.00 33.03 A: yeah i think you're you're definitely right about that 

33.40 36.51 B: and what do we think that they can do to curve it 

37.31 42.06 A: i think they can for one thing put the big boys in jail 

42.34 43.58 B: and real 

43.00 45.29 A: throw away the key i'm sorry 

44.84 47.74 B: real jail not not the luxury prison 

45.97 48.15 A: right [laughter] 

47.95 53.58 B: um not the luxury prisons where they are getting caviar and lobster and hard time 

53.47 54.71 A: right 

54.08 55.83 B: put 'em on the chain line 

55.77 59.73 A: right [laughter] where are you are you from new york 

56.76 57.51 B: [laughter] 

59.23 61.12 B: no i'm from philadelphia 

60.62 65.38 A: oh okay i knew it had to be new york philadelphia or new jersey somewhere in there 

64.68 66.08 B: where are you from 

66.07 67.84 A: i'm fr- in atlanta 

67.36 68.71 B: oh all right 

68.10 69.87 A: yeah 

68.99 76.40 B: so yeah so it's just that you know they do they do the crime but it's blue collar so they act like it's nothing major 

76.94 80.17 B: but it affected a whole lot of people their pensions and 

80.24 94.38 B: just it it's an tumbling effect you know they start at the stop but it comes down to the to the cleaning people because they lose pensions and you know their livelihood they work twenty years and they think they have a pension in there and they don't have any money 

94.65 97.01 B: it's a sad sad situation 

96.85 100.82 A: it really is [cough] so what do you think should be done 

101.01 103.16 A: to curb this kind of thing 

102.58 113.14 B: i think they should have more monitoring of these major companies you know being that they do have the financial status they have their own accountants and all that 

113.05 118.55 B: government need to have some kind of systems in place to monitor those people 

118.85 125.82 B: because it's just like you have carte blanche you are working for the person that the person that has the money that is doing the scam is paying you 

125.85 130.01 B: so you pad the books to make your um person look good 

130.29 135.61 B: they have to do something because it can't continue on like continue on the way it is 

136.13 140.76 A: yeah i agree i don't i don't know exactly what's going to be done but i think that's 

141.02 154.48 A: probably one thing that i think excuse me i think one of the main things that can be done to discourage that type of behaviour is simply to punish people who are who are proven to be guilty of it 

154.81 155.78 B: openly 

155.04 162.50 A: stop them in their tracks and make examples of them openly and like you said send them to real jail 

162.71 165.29 A: you know just like they would anybody else because 

165.32 177.49 A: if you or i or any i'm assuming you know that you you're not one of these people who works in you know who was in top level at a top level management position in a corporation 

176.99 178.26 B: right 

177.59 182.92 A: um but if you're in that situation and and you have access to 

183.38 187.93 A: or you have an opportunity to participate in that type of behaviour 

188.21 189.94 A: i think that um 

190.69 195.65 A: you need to be stopped in your tracks i mean something like you say has to be done 

195.96 197.73 A: to stop it 

197.15 198.73 B: right because 

198.82 203.01 B: it's not it's it's not a small it's not a small crime 

203.58 217.89 B: it's you know it's not a small crime to get a couple of headlines in the paper then it's not hurting no more what actually happens to those people that were found guilty in enron do we ever know no it's not in the news no more 

215.98 217.18 A: right 

217.26 227.06 A: and you know what is funny to me is you have people who write bad checks and i'm not saying that it's right to write a bad check to a merchant or to anybody else but 

223.88 224.93 B: mhm 

227.50 231.86 A: you can get prison time if you can thinking of writing bad checks 

231.22 232.14 B: right 

232.72 247.65 A: and yet i mean i have known people who have gotten you know maybe five years ten years whatever depending on how much was involved for writing a bad check and yet these people can steal literally millions of dollars from people 

248.17 252.74 A: and also from thousands of people and nothing happens 

250.60 251.60 B: mhm 

252.78 255.73 B: yes and i believe the stock the stock market 

255.75 269.43 B: actually is affected by it because all these big corporations are reporting that they have all this gain and once they do the paperwork it's just paper money they actually don't have all that money so the stock markets are affected 

269.32 273.09 B: by these corrupt you know people 

272.31 278.50 A: well and the other way that they're affected too is the fact that people like you and me 

278.82 287.07 A: ah typically become more ah more distrusting of corporate america in general i know i'm more distrusting 

282.51 283.49 B: right 

287.03 300.99 A: that alone with the fact that we know that well along with the fact that i was reading not long ago that a lot of the ah the top level managers in corporations get these huge bonuses 

301.05 305.19 A: besides already being paid really really well 

305.23 310.83 A: in addition to that they get these big big big bonuses for meeting certain goals 

308.77 309.78 B: mhm 

310.34 311.28 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

311.16 316.97 A: and even when their when their jobs are eliminated they're the first ones 

317.24 318.76 A: who are um 

319.19 324.74 A: provided for i mean it's like screw all the rest of you you know all the rest of the employees 

322.58 323.49 B: right 

324.10 326.53 B: the hard working ones [laughter] 

325.46 331.98 A: you just have to do the best can you you you might get you know maybe a couple of months pay or something like that but 

332.19 337.67 A: it seems like they get huge bonuses and they're taken care of for life you know 

337.19 350.50 B: right so now people that have a little bit of money that want to invest in some stock are scared now because of these major corporations that are scam scamming so we won't take our little bit of change and 

349.76 358.66 A: yeah and put it in the stock market instead i think a lot of people are going with the more conservative investments like real estate 

350.42 352.81 B: put it in the stock market 

357.87 358.89 B: right 

358.79 367.42 A: t. bills um bonds and things like that that are a little bit like i said a lot more conservative 

360.22 361.50 B: or bonds 

366.83 373.01 B: but they don't have big returns you know they have smaller returns but they have more security 

368.97 370.17 A: right 

372.74 375.43 A: right more security less risk 

374.82 379.39 B: right right and that you know and it's all of us have our 

379.36 390.80 B: a lot of us have our pensions and our 401ks invested into the stock market so you know if we're not retiring within twenty years what do we look at you know with all this scandal and all this 

388.27 389.52 A: right 

390.68 399.03 B: stuff going on will there be any money will there be any social security [laughter] because they want to take our social security benefits and invest it 

399.53 401.46 A: yeah that's true 

401.44 403.71 B: so it's it's a major concern 

401.77 413.96 A: that's a pretty sad state of affairs and i think like you said something must be done and quickly otherwise i guess we are all kind of 

413.89 418.04 A: our pensions will go in the hell in the hand basket so to speak 

417.63 420.76 B: you have to come from the top the top man 

420.57 426.27 A: yeah and speaking of that i mean i haven't been real impressed with our current administration 

426.08 426.91 B: no 

426.28 428.98 A: in terms of actions taken 

429.06 433.19 A: against people who have committed those kinds of crimes 

433.21 438.59 A: i don't think there's going to be very much done either because i mean when you think about it i mean 

439.17 441.44 A: you don't cut off 

441.52 444.29 A: the source that feeds you so to speak 

443.11 447.36 B: right that's it that's it that's the bottom line [laughter] 

446.69 448.66 A: (( [laughter] )) 

447.37 453.70 B: that's the bottom line so those big corporations funds a lot of the political campaigns and 

453.99 461.26 B: things to that nature so if you are going after them then that means the money that they are putting into you 

461.28 462.72 B: are going to cease 

463.19 474.15 B: so we all [laughter] so let's quiet it down let's put it in the headlines a couple of days let it die down get another big issue and then people will kind of press this under the table 

474.57 480.27 A: right and that's what has happened since we have been involved with this war with iraq because 

478.44 479.35 B: right 

480.29 486.01 A: people aren't talking quite as much as about about the economy people are still losing jobs 

486.21 491.57 A: but when you look at the fact that people are losing their lives in the war with iraq 

491.05 491.97 B: yeah 

491.59 494.17 A: that kind of took a back seat 

494.06 495.61 B: took a back seat 

494.99 496.51 A: yeah so 

496.15 504.53 B: some other corporation is is doing the same thing that enron was doing but he's getting away with it right now [laughter] 

501.30 502.21 A: (( oh )) 

502.84 506.91 A: yeah and eventually it it will come to light 

506.32 510.68 B: yes but after he has made millions of dollars 

510.37 511.90 A: oh yeah 

510.90 514.15 B: and have put it somewhere where it may never be found 

513.85 516.77 A: and the thing that gets me too is that 

517.14 525.34 A: these people really are in need of the money much less than the average person i mean they're already making 

525.35 537.45 A: millions of dollars i mean they would make that whether they stole money or not but in addition to the money that they're already getting paid the salaries and the bonuses and all the other perks 

531.01 532.29 B: right 

538.12 545.85 A: they can't settle for that they've got to steal got to scam and scrounge around to ah to get more 

545.26 547.65 B: it's that cut the rope attitude 

547.85 561.96 B: you know you know just go after the jug- jugular and get whatever i can get don't care who it's going to affect and it not only affects those immediate people in their company it affects all of us in some way or another 

562.36 574.84 A: well i think it it starts to affect like you say not just the investors of the particular corporation that's affected you know where the scam takes place but it also affects 

575.11 582.63 A: people's attitudes towards corporate america in general which in turn affects our national economy 

577.58 578.94 B: mhm 

583.04 598.03 B: yes and and national economy needs to be affected in a positive way right now [laughter] because it has enough negativity going on around us that we need to bring something positive so if he showed us that he was working 

587.92 590.78 A: yeah you you better believe that 

597.92 599.89 B: to do something with these
