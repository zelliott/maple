23.80 26.21 B: yeah that's what came to mind for me 

25.64 27.41 A: okay same here 

27.53 32.74 B: um the government what can the government do um i think if they would 

33.01 39.56 B: maybe have more checks and balances with the um corporation on their reports that they put out 

39.14 40.37 A: right 

40.09 41.29 B: might help 

41.94 48.47 A: i know that where i work is they've gone very very extreme on um ethics and they 

48.43 57.09 A: do a lot more communication you know on this is how we do things this is our accounting practice we don't you know we will not put up with any you know blah blah blah 

57.01 58.17 B: real strict 

57.83 64.85 A: very very strict i think a lot of the big companies have had to come out with that you know to say we are not doing anything like that you know 

61.58 62.47 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

64.48 66.16 B: yes you can trust us 

65.78 72.47 A: well you know because i and i think that's one thing that's said is it how has it affected the stock market and i and i i'm sure it has 

72.51 73.60 B: (( yeah )) 

72.90 78.98 A: the safe in the the company i mean was shocking when all that started never thought about 

78.27 84.19 B: right that they would lie about that and um yeah be dishonest about their earnings and mislead 

82.63 83.70 A: (( right )) 

84.32 90.26 A: and play that kind of game i mean and how many people it affected how many employees did it affect at that company 

90.32 96.41 A: that it devastated with no you know no pos- no retirement built up gosh 

94.55 95.82 B: (( right )) 

95.86 96.94 B: (( yes )) 

97.22 99.12 B: lots lost the lot 

98.57 104.47 A: yeah yes and then to kind of find a couple of other companies have done it as well to to play that game 

104.41 106.29 B: yeah yeah it's bad 

105.79 110.36 A: yeah so that so what can the government do huh 

110.28 112.31 B: yeah what can the government do 

111.49 112.86 A: gosh 

113.37 119.06 A: what really it really saddens me is that the government has to keep getting involved and involved and involved 

119.35 131.88 A: you know and that there can't be regulations out there that like like the accounting firms you always assumed okay since accounting firms are doing the the audits and a double check and all that but but was it was it arthur andersen 

119.88 120.96 B: right 

131.62 132.56 B: yes 

131.92 133.59 A: that also got in trouble 

134.02 135.08 B: (( yeah )) 

134.25 138.47 A: (( like gee your whole faith in the whole system was like oh no )) 

137.63 142.39 B: yeah they were all um lying about numbers so maybe 

140.77 143.79 A: right now the government is going to have to step in and help 

143.34 147.91 B: right and have extra checks to make sure that everyone is being honest 

147.26 149.37 A: mhm mhm 

148.31 152.28 B: yeah and i think the stiff penalties for those who do lie 

152.09 153.33 A: yes 

152.47 154.00 B: and deceive 

153.70 158.89 A: and make it really well known what those penalties are right i mean of course 

156.68 157.78 B: right 

157.79 160.14 B: you do this this is going to happen yeah 

159.57 162.13 A: right and earlier in the earlier in the game 

162.30 174.59 A: so that so not many employees' lives are so devastated by it you know every year whatever so now we have what somebody checking the checking company i mean somebody is going to have to audit the audit company i guess 

171.30 172.47 B: right 

173.71 174.71 B: right 

174.75 175.73 B: right 

174.88 178.90 A: but it would be a shame to spend more government money to do that but i guess if it 

179.39 181.14 A: which means more of our money 

180.74 184.20 B: right yeah that's right it is a shame that they 

183.79 189.11 A: yeah so i'm but i'm not sure of the answer i don't know what other answer unless you have a 

189.40 194.74 A: well there would almost have to be somebody that's accountable to the government another audit company 

195.00 199.65 B: uh-huh yes i don't know what would make sense be honest though either 

195.61 196.88 A: i guess 

198.43 209.58 A: right exactly unless it's oh my gosh you could get into all sorts of i guess the only thing that's going to keep the confidence of of the united states people as 

209.58 215.25 A: you know being within a company like i._m. that that just continuously says here this is what we're doing 

215.34 216.31 A: you know 

216.70 225.47 A: um i know we were the company i work for was in a magazine it was like one of the top what was it hundred ethical companies in the country 

225.07 226.43 B: oh that's good 

225.84 236.11 A: yeah yeah because they're just going and this this comes out every year so it's not like something new because of enron you know they they do this every year but they are looking for specific things that ah 

230.54 231.19 B: (( [cough] )) 

231.56 232.49 B: right 

236.37 239.17 A: um that companies are doing to make sure 

239.58 245.45 A: that their stockholders are you know comfortable and their employees are comfortable so 

245.60 249.31 B: yeah i think that's a good a good idea to do that 

247.50 248.60 A: (( i wonder if )) 

248.66 252.07 A: yeah i wonder if the government couldn't do something on that same kind of i 

252.13 253.97 A: wonder who does all that checking 

253.69 255.03 B: right 

254.24 255.25 A: you know 

255.18 256.12 B: uh-huh 

255.71 257.85 A: maybe they could use that same system 

257.59 263.39 B: yeah just show they would want it to be high on the ethical list and they'd want their company listed 

262.99 264.05 A: right 

263.58 268.02 B: as high 'cause that would give people confidence and invest in their company and 

267.46 268.48 A: right 

268.06 269.44 B: you know that would be 

269.08 274.14 A: i wonder what they i don't know what they use but i mean there would be something that maybe it's already in place that wouldn't cost 

274.17 276.14 A: the taxpayer so much money 

276.06 276.97 B: uh-huh 

276.90 283.81 A: i don't know about you but it just seems like every time we turn around the government has got to get involved and to regulate something because 

283.91 285.58 A: somebody has ruined it for 

285.65 289.46 B: right right they don't always do the best job either so 

286.40 287.32 A: (( you know )) 

288.54 290.36 A: right right 

290.36 298.67 B: yeah not not to pay them so yeah that sounds that sounds good what was the other question oh how has it affected us 

298.07 299.20 A: yeah 

299.08 309.30 B: um yeah i'm a stay at home mom but my husband works and um it's affected us i guess because the 401k keeps coming back um with quarterly losses 

308.70 310.45 A: (( losses )) 

309.51 320.64 B: loss loss loss and yeah we're just in our mid thirties and we're looking for retirement and wanting to not knowing what to do um where to put our money and 

316.49 317.59 A: sure 

320.01 321.08 A: sure 

320.68 325.24 B: and um so it has affected us and that we aren't 

325.31 329.12 B: we're not making anything on the money that we do invest and um 

328.19 329.09 A: mm 

329.78 332.99 B: yeah then we don't know really what else to do with it so 

332.28 345.34 A: right right and of course you know granted it was inflated for a while and maybe it was inflated because of these companies being you know being dishonest i mean really you had a stock market doubled and it you know maybe there was a 

339.68 342.13 B: [laughter] yeah yeah 

345.59 349.15 A: maybe if it that hadn't happened maybe they're the ones that caused it 

349.27 351.63 A: while these you know great earnings and 

351.74 356.93 A: all that and and now we're hitting seeing a ripple effect of not only going back to 

357.41 361.78 A: to the negative like you said um quarterly reports but also 

361.86 363.72 A: where's reality in this 

363.88 366.22 A: where wo- where would we be realistically 

366.61 372.06 A: you know and and and if they did they inflate it so much now that they really are hurting everybody 

367.13 368.08 B: yeah 

372.65 373.81 B: yeah 

373.21 377.52 A: maybe it's not just their employees they hurt but maybe 'cause the stock market is you know 

378.23 380.30 A: rebounding from it 

379.68 383.13 B: right yeah yeah there's a lot a lot going on 

382.57 383.81 A: gosh 

383.40 389.04 B: all it with nine eleven and the war and enron and just you know 

387.72 388.61 A: right 

388.77 395.73 A: and usually usually usually 'cause i'm older i mean usually the like the vietnam war and stuff sim- stimulated our economy 

389.17 390.32 B: confidence 

395.93 400.32 A: and wars normally do that in some ways i mean the other is tightening in other areas but 

399.82 400.71 B: uh-huh 

400.48 402.67 A: but you kind of wonder if ah 

402.82 408.31 A: you know the timing of all this with enron and all the other companies the dot com companies and stuff that happened to that 

408.48 414.30 A: it kind of um you know ruining that part of the stimulation of the economy 

413.70 415.49 B: yeah yeah yeah there's 

415.71 423.35 B: been a lot been going on in the last few years with it so i don't know if it's just the corporate conduct or but um 

417.69 418.92 A: mhm 

422.77 423.86 A: (( right is )) 

424.57 429.57 A: your is your husband's company kind of going out of their way to make sure everybody's comfortable and 

428.94 433.27 B: yeah yeah they do uh-huh he works for a family owned company 

432.69 434.26 A: oh that's nice 

433.48 435.05 B: yeah yeah and they 

435.28 439.52 B: they have good earning systems that is finally coming back but um 

440.17 446.72 B: i don't know that it didn't sound like they go out to the extreme that you all do but they're private so they don't they don't have to prove anything 

444.03 445.60 A: but they're yeah 

446.61 456.76 A: yeah and that that is a difference i mean the family still needs to [cough] family operated still needs to [cough] make their employees comfortable but at the same you don't have the thousands of employees to 

456.78 457.76 B: right 

456.94 459.26 A: to worry about to you know to 

459.62 460.49 B: yeah 

459.76 462.19 A: communicate to i guess is what i'm trying to say 

462.07 463.18 B: right 

462.58 464.67 A: it's not as critical that's good 

465.05 466.03 A: man 

465.82 473.29 A: you know it's just an interesting question that they pose today isn't it the i know last time i was on a call i was i didn't take the call because nobody 

473.08 481.29 A: to get on with me and it was very confusing so when she first said the topic i went okay i hope she's going to go into more detail on this [laughter] 

479.48 488.50 B: uh-huh yeah they said the topic and then i then a man came on it sounded like a recording and i didn't understand how it worked so i hung up and i was like oh my gosh i'm confused so 

487.83 489.98 A: oh funny a man came on oh 

489.67 496.47 B: yeah and he said patrick or something he didn't say like hi and i thought i just had to ramble on for ten minutes i didn't quite understand 

492.33 493.71 A: (( okay )) 

495.90 497.05 A: on no 

497.14 500.27 B: yeah but what did they want to know anything else 

499.78 501.34 A: i don't think so let's see 

500.31 502.30 B: corporate conduct and the 

502.10 509.26 A: the scandal and how the scandals affected us and how has the scandals affected the i guess everybody else i mean that's kind of 

508.48 510.88 B: yeah like you said it sounds bad 

509.52 512.64 A: what yeah what have they shown the the 

514.01 514.83 A: the
