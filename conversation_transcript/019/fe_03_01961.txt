0.69 2.41 A: hi this is jackie 

0.71 1.59 B: (( hello )) 

2.26 3.94 B: hi this is christine 

3.77 10.35 A: [laughter] hi christine [laughter] this is an interesting subject [laughter] what's you 

4.85 5.77 B: hi 

7.82 9.04 B: (( yeah i )) 

9.06 12.90 B: think i can do about forty seconds out of that [laughter] 

11.50 13.65 A: [laughter] oh is that right 

13.00 13.91 B: (( yeah )) 

13.97 14.98 A: oh 

14.99 21.48 A: um it really hasn't affected me personally financially i think ah 

21.53 24.08 A: morally it probably affects us all 

24.32 25.77 A: (( what do you think [laughter] )) 

25.32 34.24 B: probably to a small degree but not directly you know i guess what affects one person kind of affects other people and it spreads but not directly at all 

34.36 35.90 A: (( yeah )) 

34.80 35.73 B: um 

36.27 49.84 B: i i don't know that i heard that topic exactly clearly um they were talking about corporate scandals like enron right so that's gist oh okay all right then i did get it yeah i don't i don't think that that's affected me directly at all 

42.80 44.54 A: yeah yeah 

45.87 46.70 A: (( yeah )) 

50.37 63.09 A: and then i think the other part of it was what the government should or or could do to um i guess regulate it or or control it or if they should or shouldn't do anything about that 

62.91 67.28 B: first off i think stop taking these campaign contributions 

68.04 71.11 B: so they wouldn't have an incentive to not do anything about it 

73.55 87.74 A: okay i i probably i probably agree with that to the effect that i think that a lot of politicians are quote unquote owned by their interest groups um and i don't think that i don't think that i'd have an argument with that 

74.42 75.52 B: [laughter] 

83.43 84.27 B: yes 

88.07 90.71 A: that statement at all um 

91.76 93.69 A: as far as as 

93.75 95.45 A: that um 

96.07 104.08 A: regulating what they will or will won't do i think that that probably has more to do with the general public taking an interest and either allowing them 

104.08 114.42 A: not allowing them as has been the case many times in where i'm from in new england ah the case of where the worse they are it seems the more they'll let them you know [laughter] [mn] 

113.39 121.75 B: well i think if um if they didn't have the the money thing hanging over their heads then the the idea of doing what's right 

121.84 130.13 B: could have some sort of prominence in in their plans but you know they have this money hanging over their head and their career and if they want to keep going 

130.47 133.97 B: then they kind of have to go along with the status quo in a way 

134.51 136.01 B: i think the public 

136.88 144.31 B: even though they take an interest in certain things politicians b._s. the public all the time and people just kinda sit back and go for it 

144.57 145.98 B: so i don't know how much 

146.72 149.21 B: just the public knowing alone is going to do 

149.72 159.16 B: like when this whole enron thing went on the president's like we need tougher laws and da da da da but in reality if they just enforced the laws that exist already 

159.51 161.24 B: it wouldn't of happened 

162.20 166.71 A: yeah i i think that's probably true in in the mainstream of well 

166.69 179.76 A: they're always great at making new laws but then everything is ah seems to be enforced haphazardly i.e. it's the little guy that that bears the repercussion of of the laws that are passed as opposed to 

168.67 169.75 B: mhm 

172.56 173.37 B: (( [laughter] yep )) 

176.37 177.30 B: you know 

180.11 182.55 A: um yep 

180.15 180.96 B: right 

181.99 185.53 B: the bigger you are the more able to find a loophole you are i think 

185.74 188.01 A: well yeah you got the money to spend 

186.02 188.84 B: or the better friends you have [laughter] 

188.06 198.47 A: yeah yeah you got the money to spend to to find the loopholes and you got the money to oh what's that ah when politicians influence people [laughter] 

189.03 189.97 B: buddies 

197.16 198.72 B: yeah yeah 

199.35 200.65 B: exactly 

201.33 208.72 B: well that's all i have to say on the topic [laughter] now can we go off the topic or do you have to stay on this one particular topic 

203.33 205.33 A: [laughter] 

208.48 212.85 A: i think we're supposed to stay on the topic i don't know how we can [laughter] 

211.57 214.93 B: yeah yeah for eight minutes we're supposed to talk about that topic 

215.00 215.94 A: pardon me 

215.60 218.70 B: i said for eight minutes you're supposed to talk about that that topic 

218.53 220.04 A: yeah 

219.21 223.69 B: well i started reading michael moore's book stupid white men have you heard of it 

223.60 226.04 A: i i've heard of it yeah how is it 

225.43 232.18 B: it it's pretty good he talks about some of this stuff and other things as well but but some of the way that ah 

232.19 237.70 B: things happen in politics and politicians say that didn't happen and people just kind of say oh okay 

238.17 242.02 B: but they're simple things that go on go on right in front of your face that if you 

242.27 244.54 B: really looked to see you'd see them 

245.73 246.46 B: so 

246.54 248.52 B: he goes into some of that stuff 

248.67 261.56 A: oh i i think that that carries on all the way from from local law law enforcement all the way up you know it it it it's who you know not what the law is um i know that i've had 

253.92 255.80 B: oh yeah oh yeah 

261.71 265.12 A: my daughter had a had a guy that ah 

265.43 271.00 A: that she was dating that that i always told her that he was a little psycho in the head well 

271.22 276.36 A: um he came over my house he was i don't know if he was high he was drunk he was something 

276.70 288.55 A: and they were sitting out on the stoop and it was like midnight and she had a new baby and i and the baby was in the house and he start he woke up and started crying i went out and get her told her she needed to come in the house and tend to the baby 

288.71 291.82 A: she comes in the house gets the baby goes out on the porch 

291.37 293.03 B: [laughter] 

292.01 303.14 A: i said oh no no no no no honey you're not understanding and you know it's midnight i don't care if it's the middle of summer bring that baby in the house well he went off on me just in a tirade 

293.91 296.07 B: (( stay in and tend to the baby )) 

303.27 307.34 A: and um i ended up he wouldn't leave and then 

307.35 308.43 A: um 

309.47 316.53 A: i don't know my son i guess got involved and he and the guy finally left and the next day he came back 

317.41 328.76 A: even in more of a rage i guess he just simmered on it all night or did whatever he did all night and came back early in the morning in more of a rage and i called the law you wouldn't believe what a fight i had trying to get them 

322.56 323.62 B: mhm 

329.13 330.24 B: (( to come out )) 

330.14 336.30 A: to to to put a restraining order on him because he holed up when he found out that i called was calling the law 

332.35 333.40 B: oh 

337.19 337.93 B: (( mm )) 

337.21 341.34 A: but then the third cop that showed up for it because i mean 

341.89 346.31 A: then it ended up three weeks later he ended up slitting some guy's throat so now he's sitting in prison 

346.48 347.28 B: (( gosh )) 

346.80 348.54 A: so you know 

347.31 348.48 B: could have been you 

348.74 349.71 B: [laughter] 

349.82 351.62 A: (( [laughter] )) 

350.38 351.43 B: you're lucky 

353.29 354.60 B: (( some people know how to pick )) 

353.53 363.64 A: sometimes they just don't take things as seriously as they should and i think that it like i say it goes all the way from from little local stuff all the way up to big stuff that ends up affecting everybody you know 

359.63 361.02 B: them yeah yeah 

362.40 366.51 B: even little local stuff goes beyond just not taking things seriously they 

366.81 370.18 B: the whole institution of of the police system is 

370.37 371.53 B: i mean it's it's 

371.72 374.96 B: not designed to be corrupted but it's hard to not be 

375.26 379.54 B: i mean just in its nature there's gonna be corruption and there's gonna be 

379.74 386.49 B: loopholes that they get to get through that you know they're supposed to be enforcing the law and they're breaking it so i don't know 

385.66 392.95 A: i mean yeah how many times have you had a cop go whizzing by you only to see him pulled over at mcdonald's or something up the road you know 

389.13 390.12 B: (( you know )) 

390.53 392.32 B: you know [laughter] 

393.29 400.81 A: um and and so i don't know is it just human nature that the more power you have the more you have to take advantage of it 

396.93 398.31 B: drinking and driving 

400.36 402.07 B: (( yeah yep )) 

402.55 403.76 B: that's it 

403.70 405.37 A: (( [laughter] )) 

404.64 405.70 B: that's it 

405.73 409.91 A: so how so how do you then regulate and how do you how do you um 

410.21 411.93 A: (( set up ah )) 

412.35 416.75 A: checks and balances i mean that's supposed to be what the senate and house and all does 

417.51 421.80 A: set up sets checks and balances for each other and for the presidency but 

422.39 424.43 A: how do you actually effect that 

424.10 428.36 B: you have to strip all the possibilities for corruption that you see 

428.37 432.95 B: and you know in in politics basically like i said the funding thing 

433.09 434.08 B: um 

433.54 435.03 A: mhm 

434.36 441.34 B: having pub- public meetings all the meetings should be public and broadcast like they do on c-span for most of them 

441.23 442.25 A: mhm 

441.43 446.42 B: um policies maybe if they made the policies understandable for everybody 

446.61 452.42 B: because a lot of people don't do politics because they don't know what they're talking about you know if they can understand it 

450.74 455.08 A: because it gets so involved that that your average joe 

454.03 456.10 B: it's another language yeah [laughter] 

455.90 469.18 A: [laughter] never mind that but doesn't have the time to spend four days to to to listen to arguments about um why the the the pine beetle ah the pros and cons of the pine beetle 

459.74 461.30 B: try and understand 

468.84 470.75 B: [laughter] mhm 

470.14 476.12 A: and why fourteen million dollars should go into funding more research to find out its breeding 

475.96 477.89 B: right right right 

476.40 477.89 A: habits you know 

478.45 479.41 A: so 

478.59 486.58 B: i like the news programs that um where they kind of break it down they say this is the issue this is what's going on and then they'll play a clip of the debate 

484.91 486.56 A: like frontline or 

486.77 493.39 B: um i don't know what i was listening to something this morning i don't know what it was even but um they were talking about um 

493.85 496.54 B: partial birth abortion and something else 

496.57 499.00 B: related to that i can't remember what the other thing was 

499.13 508.65 B: but the guy basically explained his side and what the issue was and you know just made it really simple to understand and then he played the clip of of the meeting or the 

508.81 513.71 B: debate or whatever it was so you can kinda understand it a little easier that way 

513.37 514.18 A: (( mm )) 

514.22 518.10 B: that would be helpful to make it really accessible to everybody so they know 

518.47 520.76 B: when people are bsing [laughter] 

520.79 523.91 A: which brings me to another thing does the government have 

524.67 527.36 A: have too much say so in too much 

528.52 531.20 B: hm in some things i think so but 

531.40 532.77 B: i'd rather 

534.20 537.71 B: i even though i'm i'm anti 

537.88 542.32 B: you know big brother and stuff like that i think i'd lean more toward 

542.39 544.80 B: them having too much than having too little 

545.01 546.01 A: yeah 

545.40 556.09 B: i mean i think it's gone too far at this point you know with the whole nine eleven thing and just a lot of a lot of freedoms being taken without there being a really good reason 

551.44 552.29 A: yeah 

556.97 558.29 B: but generally 

558.72 562.09 B: i'd say it's for the government to be involved because if they're not 

562.70 564.02 B: you'll have 

564.79 568.00 B: lesser hoodlums [laughter] taking over things you know 

568.19 576.30 B: if they don't regulate this that and the other thing somebody's going to be in there that's going to be corrupt and probably more corrupt so it's like a lesser of two evils 

577.55 579.03 B: like in industry 

579.43 581.31 B: meat packing that kind of stuff 

579.71 580.49 A: (( it )) 

582.64 587.38 A: is not a perfect world [laughter] 

582.74 583.76 B: i don't know 

584.82 585.97 B: not at all 

586.63 588.12 B: far from it 

588.00 589.11 A: (( hm )) 

588.80 590.19 B: far from it 

590.84 591.63 B: so 

592.25 598.45 A: so you say you say that that you'd rather see them have have more power than less power 

597.85 598.87 B: mhm 

598.46 599.68 A: where
