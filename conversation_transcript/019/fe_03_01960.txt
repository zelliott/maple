42.43 43.76 A: oh really 

42.55 47.58 B: [laughter] based on the other topics i've done on these phone calls this one hit me from out of the blue 

47.58 48.69 B: i mean 

48.63 56.45 B: i think it's terrible i think it's terrible that there are that the way america has evolved is that there are these huge corporations 

56.32 67.03 B: with these guys who are doing awful stuff and hiding millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts and laundering money and you know insider trading and there's all kinds of stuff going on 

67.09 68.17 B: and 

67.50 68.87 A: and getting away with 

68.65 77.78 B: and they're exactly and they're getting away with it and i don't necessarily believe the government should intervene in everything but i think if nothing else is taking care of it somebody needs to 

78.37 83.87 A: it yeah i agree and i one of the main things that i have a problem with is the fact that 

84.60 97.80 A: you've got these big corporate giants you these people i was reading the other day about all the money that a lot of the ce- c._e._o.s are collecting um who are ah you know caught up in the job 

93.59 94.48 B: mhm 

97.78 101.40 A: reduction and ah work force reduction and so on 

98.90 100.07 B: mhm 

101.04 101.90 B: right 

101.44 102.46 A: and how they're 

102.72 109.56 A: some of them are getting most of them are getting millions of dollars and all that and i and and i'm not 

106.75 107.64 B: yeah 

109.36 119.60 A: disagreeable with the fact that they're getting paid well but my thing is that um you know even with the with the as far as the scandals are concerned is ah 

119.91 121.87 A: in many cases you know they 

121.92 125.46 A: they already making big big big bucks 

124.56 125.41 B: uh-huh 

125.23 139.53 A: and then on top of that they're not satisfied with the money that they're making and then they go out and they pull these stunts like that and then they give you know if somebody is caught with ah you know you've got a lot of people who you know kids who are 

130.58 132.98 B: well and in addition to that 

133.00 133.97 B: yeah 

139.45 149.25 A: caught up in selling drugs and and even adults and if they're caught with just a little bit of mar- marijuana they give them ten years fifteen years 

140.89 141.85 B: mhm 

145.86 146.83 B: (( mhm )) 

147.55 149.24 B: right right 

149.18 156.96 A: and these people who are stealing millions of dollars ruining people's retire ruining people's futures you know when when 

151.59 153.06 B: yep yep 

156.86 165.45 A: in the case of enron and m._c._i. and all that i mean they're people whose futures are literally just tossed to the wind 

158.26 159.27 B: mhm 

159.62 160.52 B: yep 

163.19 164.44 B: oh absolutely 

164.71 166.84 B: (( that's right financially )) 

166.67 181.63 A: that's what i have a problem with i and i really think that they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and i don't think that there's much difference between them and the the guy the drug lords the people who are selling drugs and making big bucks 

168.50 169.38 B: yeah 

177.90 178.76 B: (( yep )) 

179.30 180.58 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

180.92 193.93 B: well in general the government's priorities are off if you know if they're going after the little guys instead of starting from the top you know i mean how many white collar criminals behind their desk who are embezzling small amounts of money 

193.93 206.37 B: wouldn't be happening if governments were monitoring corporations that were allowing corruption from the top if they got good ethical people in starting from the top going all the way down they wouldn't be hiring guys who'd be able to get away with embezzling money 

206.48 208.83 A: right right and that's true 

207.02 207.98 B: you know 

209.04 212.03 A: that's very true and just recently 

210.72 221.61 B: and the same thing like you said about the drug lords you know go after the the big supplier guys don't go after you know people who are small scale and on the street and yeah 

217.77 222.40 A: the little guy on the street who's making a few couple a hundred dollars a day 

221.92 229.93 B: yeah go start from the top and you'll actually be able to address the problem start start that small and you'll never be able to do it yeah 

222.62 224.74 A: or even a thousand dollars a day 

226.91 236.04 A: yeah but you'll never address it ah completely if if you just go after if you start at the bottom the people who are at the bottom of the totem pole 

233.56 234.98 B: yep exactly 

235.47 236.63 B: exactly 

236.70 241.46 A: yeah and and that's what i say too so i i think it's just ridiculous 

239.29 241.07 B: well and the other thing is 

240.91 247.23 B: you know you look at these guys and it's so crazy how america how the whole 

247.05 256.49 B: ideal has changed it's funny because i'm a teacher and i was covering somebody else's class the other day and they were discussing american ideology and 

256.31 264.09 B: looking at ah walt whitman who lived in the eighteen hundreds and what was the ideology of the eighteen hundreds compared to now and the kids said now 

263.85 272.79 B: everybody hates america who's not american but everybody in america thinks we're great because we're totally selfish we're all about what do i want what can i get 

270.57 272.17 A: [laughter] 

272.89 283.51 B: and that's exactly what's going on these guys are like okay you're not happy with the twenty four million dollars you already have now wait a minute you play you pay all of your employees you know poor fred and his wife over there 

283.38 291.63 B: you pay them seventeen thousand dollars a year and you have twenty four million dollars and you're going to rip off all of your stock holders too 'cause you don't think that's enough 

291.65 295.41 B: i mean it's crazy it's got to it's gotten to be 

295.40 307.43 B: such great extremes these guys have so much money and the employees are so poor they are earning so little compared to the big guys and the middle class is getting wiped out by these big corporations 

307.49 317.50 A: and you know it almost makes you think about well it makes me think about the way it is the way it was in iraq you know with ah saddam [laughter] he was living 

313.19 314.29 B: (( mhm )) 

317.51 320.51 A: like a well he was literally a i mean like a king 

320.04 320.91 B: uh-huh 

320.54 329.72 A: i mean you know i heard about these these all these you know he drank from some um container that was made of gold or something 

320.94 321.83 B: oh yeah 

327.60 328.52 B: right 

329.10 335.25 B: right yeah i know i was reading about all of this insane stuff that they found in his palaces yeah 

332.37 336.72 A: all this extravagant stuff that he that he had or 

336.01 336.67 B: (( yeah yep )) 

336.76 351.46 A: that he used and all of that and i just think that it's just ridiculous i mean it's it's it's awful i mean we are in a sense not too much better ah i mean we have freedoms to do things and we you know we can work 

349.69 350.58 B: mhm 

351.40 363.92 A: basically wherever we're qualified to work in most cases and make money and take the money and spend it the way we like for the most part and and we do have freedoms and i'm glad to be in america i'd rather be here than anywhere else in the world 

353.59 354.45 B: (( mhm )) 

363.37 366.67 B: oh definitely but i think most americans abuse those freedoms 

366.88 370.36 B: they don't take the responsibility that comes along with it 

367.49 369.24 A: yeah and and the people 

370.96 372.24 A: and the people 

371.03 371.98 B: like 

372.42 380.64 B: like i was just gonna say you know like like managing your your company and paying your employees properly and making sure that you know 

372.52 373.62 A: go ahead 

380.86 384.52 B: the if you own a company and you have a bunch of people that work for you 

384.30 396.88 B: you distribute the profits through your employees you provide profit sharing you send dividends to your investors you know it's not all about how can i get rich and have a million other people doing the work so that i can jaunt around being rich 

396.65 399.48 B: you know the responsibilities of being free 

400.32 402.15 B: need to be taken care of 

400.73 412.73 A: well to me now it seems like i mean 'cause they're already rich i mean if you can live very comfortably by going by the book as a c._e._o. i mean very comfortably you can be rich 

408.53 409.37 B: mhm 

410.95 411.99 B: mhm 

412.13 413.36 B: yep 

412.73 418.26 A: and if you're president of m._c._i. i mean well not now maybe [laughter] but 

416.79 418.30 B: (( yep [laughter] )) 

418.88 425.72 A: when they were in their heyday i mean you could do very well i mean you could have a very very comfortable life 

420.24 421.10 B: yeah 

425.69 439.68 A: but the thing is those people are not satisfied with just making that salary and getting all those other perks and getting stocks benefits and profit sharing and all that they they have to steal from their stock holders and 

431.25 432.07 B: (( yep yep )) 

439.61 442.76 A: all that in order to feel like they're really really i guess 

443.30 448.02 A: i think it's almost like a game i 'cause they can never spend all that money 

445.79 446.51 B: (( mhm )) 

446.78 447.70 B: yep 

448.25 459.24 A: i think it's like a game of i think it's kind of like with some of the celebrities and some of the other people who have a lot of money i mean my thing is once you get you know a certain amount of money 

454.31 455.09 B: yep 

459.05 463.61 A: every additional amount that you get each marginal unit of of 

462.97 463.71 B: [cough] 

463.71 467.76 A: dollars that you get really ain't gonna make that much difference 

465.00 465.80 B: uh-huh 

466.97 468.92 B: yeah yeah 

468.59 470.10 A: what can you do with it 

469.10 470.73 B: that's very true 

470.72 474.11 A: you know oprah's a billionaire now but i mean 

474.47 477.88 A: what what can she do she'll never spend all that money 

477.06 486.33 B: yeah and you know she you know she sells a book contract or you know does a part in a movie or something and you read about a you know fourteen million dollar contract 

486.10 488.58 B: oh yeah like she needs another fourteen million dollars 

487.45 488.25 A: [laughter] 

488.34 489.42 B: and then 

489.24 490.10 B: then 

489.94 503.49 B: to make things even worse they put these stupid shows on like celebrity who wants to be a millionaire and celebrity jeopardy and these celebrities are so rich that it wouldn't mean anything to them to win the petty you know a couple thousand dollars you can win on jeopardy 

503.34 512.23 B: so they play for charity now why don't you just get out of the way and let some american whose life would be changed by two thousand dollars stand in that spot and win the money you know 

511.60 513.65 A: that's a very good point 

512.04 526.55 B: charity's good and great and i like that but you know look at some of the charities these people pick you know like like the cat spay and neuter society it's like great thank you that money could of gone to some person who could of actually used money 

526.38 531.51 B: instead of to your charity charities should come later after individuals are taken care of 

529.13 533.87 A: and and you know something else has just occurred well occurred to me i guess 

533.91 538.65 A: in light of all the the corporate um scandals that have occurred 

537.15 538.04 B: mhm 

539.08 542.09 A: you know recently is that 

540.34 541.18 B: (( uh-huh )) 

543.82 553.97 A: i just i've just thought about this recently that if they took all the money [laughter] or just a portion of some of the money that has been stolen 

553.88 562.57 A: by some of these corporate executives in some of these scandals recently and over over the years not necessarily just recently 'cause there's no telling how much has been stolen 

557.87 558.75 B: mhm 

562.10 563.15 B: yeah 

562.53 574.01 A: that that hasn't been discovered yet but you think about how many homeless people that would help and how many handicapped babies you know babies who have birth defects people who really 

568.11 569.14 B: oh yeah 

569.19 570.06 B: yeah 

570.10 571.50 B: exactly 

572.14 574.58 B: exactly people who really need the money 

574.13 578.24 A: yeah who really do like you were saying who really do need the money 

578.11 593.02 A: who a couple of hundred dollars will make a major difference you know people who can't some older people who have a problem getting their medication you know think about how many how much that would drastically improve so the quality of so many people's lives 

580.93 581.79 B: yeah 

585.48 586.28 B: yep 

592.16 593.20 B: yeah 

593.01 599.26 A: if they would take a portion of that stolen [laughter] of of that money and put it for a good toward a good cause 

598.86 599.77 B: yep
