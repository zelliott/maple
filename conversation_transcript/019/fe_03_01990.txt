3.25 4.91 B: hi i'm marion 

4.74 5.89 A: hi marion 

6.92 11.17 B: i really don't know anything about corporate scandals it hasn't affected me 

11.35 16.09 A: well it hasn't affected me either i mean not directly i suppose you know you've got the uh 

16.18 23.13 A: the enron thing i suppose is the first thing that comes to mind when i think about the corporate scandals 

23.29 24.73 A: and you know 

24.74 28.07 A: i know a lot of people were affected by that 

27.47 28.91 B: mhm 

31.21 35.68 A: i guess ah the most recent one i live in saint louis i don't know where you are 

35.19 37.07 B: i live in massachusetts 

36.83 38.75 A: (( in massachusetts ah )) 

38.84 42.45 A: you know there's kind of a deal going on right now with um 

42.24 54.22 A: american airlines and and how they set aside you know the special pension fund for ah their executives and so all of the labor unions and everything are up in arms about that 

54.55 61.90 A: i gue- to me that kind of qualifies as another one of those corporate scandal sort of things i don't know but it [mn] yeah 

59.24 61.21 B: mhm and 

61.40 68.99 B: i i didn't watch the news today my son had a hockey game but i heard my mother was telling me something about some c._e._o. from 

69.04 72.92 B: some company she wasn't sure well she didn't tell me 

73.04 79.43 B: um both of them had to resign and they're going to get some charges against them 

76.52 77.76 A: yeah 

79.44 87.73 A: yeah i think that might be american airlines i don't know about charges against them there may be something else going on it seems like once a week there's something going on 

81.35 82.21 B: oh 

88.03 98.83 A: you know m._c._i. had a big deal where they were ah fabricating numbers and making everything look good and it got to a point where they couldn't make up numbers any more and 

99.21 100.70 A: got caught at it 

100.29 105.30 B: see now i thought that these companies have independent um 

106.13 110.97 B: accountants that have to go in and check their books 

110.56 121.18 A: well you know and i guess that is the theory but i know that when i worked ah i there was a company that i worked for and they had a you know supposed 

121.24 128.35 A: independent auditing company but you know realistically that company the auditor is paid by that company 

127.89 129.16 B: mhm 

128.54 129.54 A: you know 

129.62 142.06 A: you don'- they don't want to be the person to say oh you can't do that or you know that's where they're making their money so they're going to do whatever to make their client happy it seems like in a lot of cases anyway 

143.20 155.11 A: you know if the auditors were somehow [mn] i guess i hate to say gosh more government regulation but you've don't want a situation where you've got c._e._o.'s and the company is losing money hand over fist 

155.32 164.62 A: and the c._e._o.'s and the board of directors and everybody they're they're giving themselves these million dollar bonuses something just doesn't seem right with that you know 

164.08 172.66 B: i know but you see the same thing in ah government where you know they just voted themselves a raise and upped our taxes 

167.80 169.28 A: oh yeah 

172.67 183.31 A: well you know and and my husband and i were talking about that the other day that the days of having to have someone represent us in government i think that that is quickly coming to an end as well 

183.19 191.87 A: that you know with telephones and computers and all the communications that we have that weren't around two hundred years ago 

191.81 201.77 A: you know why should i have someone go to washington to supposedly represent my interests when in reality he's representing the interests of whoever gave him the money to get into office with to begin with 

201.35 202.20 B: true 

202.27 213.96 A: you know that if they were taking put a vote okay you know all three hundred million americans here's what we're talking about today do we want to send fourteen billion dollars to turkey so we can fly over 

213.88 217.50 A: (( no [laughter] you know let's all vote no you )) 

214.58 215.88 B: (( [laughter] )) 

216.36 217.96 B: [laughter] 

218.40 223.50 A: know where i guess congressmen and senators have kind of different interests i think if you 

223.75 227.26 A: take it back to the people that the money really belongs to 

227.29 228.38 B: mhm 

228.27 238.79 A: you know what what you're saying that the government wastes yeah you know i- it it probably doesn't seem like such a bad thing t- to these businesses to do that because they look at it and that's the way our government's run 

238.34 239.81 B: right 

239.16 241.30 A: so you know why not but 

241.81 246.54 A: you know our government has this bad habit of spending money like it's theirs or something 

246.55 247.63 A: [laughter] 

246.65 249.75 B: (( [laughter] is isn't )) 

249.08 253.79 A: ah y- i i don't know i think it's your paycheck and my paycheck 

253.19 254.30 B: i know 

254.03 261.43 A: you know where they get the money from but but there's just this bizarre theory that they think they can spend whatever like they've got just an open checkbook 

262.11 269.70 B: just like i read something about um during some meeting they slipped in some you know other um 

270.88 275.60 B: allocation of some money and it was like to go fix some statue in 

275.64 280.59 B: down south or something and people just didn't realise what they were voting for 

277.41 278.23 A: oh 

280.23 284.69 A: well they do that all the time what is that called pork pork barrel 

284.27 285.51 B: yes 

284.85 299.35 A: stuff and you know what it is is that you know fred the senator is try to get his bill through and so his buddy bob says okay you know i'll vote for you and the three other guys from south carolina will vote for you if you'll just add this one little thing here 

299.39 304.38 A: and so you know that's how they end up getting the big bill passed is by adding all the little junk to it 

303.98 305.87 B: mhm 

304.87 306.33 A: it's just crazy 

307.52 308.08 A: (( i'm )) 

308.54 310.93 A: just trying to think there was another one oh i 

313.25 314.67 A: don't recall 

315.73 324.08 A: the m._c._i. the american airlines thing oh i know what i was thinking here here sits american airlines you know threatening bankruptcy about once a week now 

323.48 324.52 B: mhm 

323.90 336.01 A: you know like well if the unions don't take a thirty percent cut in pay and you know they've got to lay off like ten thousand people and got to do all this stuff and so they're wanting another federal bailout and i'm like i'm like no 

333.49 334.86 B: oh yeah 

336.33 342.37 A: it it's it's kind of like i heard somebody refer to it as corporate welfare you know and 

341.19 342.99 B: ah mhm 

342.56 353.57 A: and it's like okay we've we've pretty well figured out over the course of time that welfare doesn't actually help anybody help themselves that it just kind of creates a class of dependency 

353.15 354.53 B: mhm 

353.91 368.42 A: and i think you know like with these airlines they're kind of in that situation like well if we run our business really poorly and american airlines had a one billion dollar loss for a quarter i mean that's incredible i can't even imagine spending that much money running an airline 

364.32 365.29 B: (( i know )) 

368.96 373.45 A: a- and so they're like back with their little hands out going okay we get more right 

373.75 376.41 A: and they were trying to tack that onto the uh 

376.63 378.72 A: the war appropriations bill 

378.27 380.50 B: mhm 

379.39 385.11 A: and you know it's it's of those deals where okay let let one of them go under and 

385.79 388.89 A: and you know then the others will pick up the slack 

388.93 395.04 A: there are certainly airlines running profitably in this country right now i mean it obviously can be done 

396.87 397.54 B: (( mm )) 

397.59 400.01 A: some of them aren't doing it very well 

405.96 408.80 A: so you're in massachusetts it's almost seven there huh 

408.40 409.92 B: yes 

409.35 413.01 A: did you initiate the phone call or did the uh thing call you 

412.70 414.07 B: it called me 

413.86 425.41 A: oh okay when it has called me in the past it's always been pretty much on the hour so i was really surprised when um my son comes up and he goes hey mom your cell phone's ringing it's like oh that's strange 

424.70 432.46 B: right i i didn't know i could go off topic but i do have a question are we supposed to leave comments or is that an optional thing 

432.70 435.46 A: i this is only my second call 

434.87 436.57 B: me too [laughter] 

435.34 448.47 A: um i didn't i didn't leave comments before i get the impression they throw out a topic this is just my theory they throw out a topic so we will have something to talk about instead of going hi i'm a stranger you're a stranger we don't know each other 

448.38 452.35 A: um it this is some other of a linguistics study 

451.59 458.08 B: yes that's what i read to dev- developing software voice recognition software 

456.30 457.49 A: yeah 

457.84 471.94 A: yeah so they take someone like you from the northeast and someone like me with a bad southern accent and they're like okay what are the differences in the way these people talk and i think that is of more interest to them than us sitting and discussing econ- yeah discussing economics you know 

463.58 464.84 B: [laughter] 

468.05 470.78 B: what we're talking about okay 

470.90 472.43 B: [laughter] 

471.73 476.00 A: i think as long as there's some rattling going on they're pretty happy with us so 

476.19 478.52 A: so you've done this is your second also 

477.16 478.99 B: this is my second one 

478.75 480.65 A: when did you get started on it 

480.00 490.27 B: um just this week uh um the first two calls i missed i wasn't home this is ah school vacation for us for us and my 

482.38 483.42 A: oh okay 

487.92 489.21 A: oh 

490.35 492.16 B: my son had a hockey game 

492.05 503.14 A: oh i was really surprised i ah signed up for it one morning and i indicated that i would be available for it at two three four five in the afternoon and i mean two hours later my phone was ringing 

502.62 503.65 B: wow 

503.30 512.96 A: and i-i didn't realise it was going to be that quick so i missed that call and then um i think i missed one yesterday as well i was out of my car for just a few seconds my son had baseball practice 

512.26 513.67 B: mhm 

513.06 520.93 A: and so i was out of the car for those few moments and missed the call and i thought oh they're they're surely going to dump me 

520.25 522.93 B: that's what i thought when i missed the first two 

523.33 526.32 A: do you ah do you like work regular work 

525.94 527.08 B: no 

527.36 529.33 A: what do you do normally 

527.91 530.52 B: i'm independent contractor 

530.20 532.17 A: do you do mystery shopping and stuff 

531.51 532.74 B: yes i do 

532.43 535.29 A: yeah i think that's where a bunch of us got onto this thing 

534.70 535.58 B: (( yeah ah )) 

535.99 537.65 A: yeah did you ah 

537.71 540.64 A: get it like the cheryl durban post or

544.23 546.40 B: oh it was everywhere you know 

545.89 546.84 A: oh 

546.72 554.14 B: people didn't believe the legitim- ah i can't even talk they're going to get like that one you know if it was like legitimate or not 

553.78 555.19 A: yeah 

555.75 556.71 A: (( i ah )) 

556.80 565.08 A: you know i signed up for it and i thought gosh you know how bad can it be and you look at it and it's actually a dot e. d. u. it's i mean it's a legitimate email address and i went through and 

563.65 564.65 B: mhm 

564.97 579.15 A: kind of did a-a search engine search on some of the fisher project and stuff and it it seems to be legitimate so i wasn't that worried about it i thought oh what's the worst thing i talk on the phone for ten minutes to a couple of strangers [laughter] 

573.09 574.53 B: mhm 

576.36 584.78 B: i know that's how i felt they're paying me that's great i mean i hope they do but [laughter] i- it wasn't a big waste of time 

584.46 586.76 A: yeah yeah exactly 

587.42 593.67 A: and they said that you could get gosh i guess up to twenty or something calls did you see that that you could actually 

592.47 599.89 B: i saw that and then i saw someone say but they only pay you for three i i don't know i don't know if what's right uh that 

596.49 598.01 A: oh is that right
