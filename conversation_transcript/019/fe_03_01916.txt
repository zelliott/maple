319.86 322.02 A: really uh 

322.44 334.57 A: yeah i think my family is a very ah productive force in my life i've been through some pretty tough times but my family's been very supportive of me and i don't know what i would do without them 

335.37 338.06 B: well that's good that's what families are supposed to do 

338.57 339.13 A: (( [noise] )) 

338.94 339.85 B: right 

339.74 341.51 A: exactly

342.03 346.04 A: and uh you know even though i make mistakes in my life 

346.12 351.74 A: my parents make sure and tell me that they still love me and they're here for me no matter what 

352.09 353.49 A: and that's just great 

354.39 356.08 B: well that is great 

357.10 359.17 A: if i could change one thing about my 

359.36 365.15 A: no i'll make this a question if you guys could change one thing about your families what would you change and why hm 

366.98 368.52 B: [laughter] 

368.86 374.09 B: i know i have a lot of republican relatives in texas i don't know maybe i'd [laughter] get get rid of them 

374.02 376.02 A: my uncle's a fascist 

376.43 381.51 B: oh or that or my in-laws are really kind of not at all pleasant to be around 

381.21 383.31 A: ah that's too bad so uh 

383.45 387.04 A: you're frustrated with your republican relatives in texas 

386.94 389.22 B: well you know i just try not to talk to them 

389.31 393.19 A: really i wish that you had a better relationship with your with your relatives i think 

393.19 394.80 B: (( [laughter] )) 

394.42 400.67 A: that's kinda too bad i kind of like it when my relatives aren't aren't of a similar political view because 

395.45 396.43 B: (( it's just )) 

400.88 404.25 A: it makes for some interesting conversation and debate 

404.73 405.96 B: yeah you know 

406.08 408.65 B: it depends on the relatives 

408.38 410.89 A: yeah that's true i mean uh 

410.45 413.06 B: they have to have an opinion to be able to debate 

412.91 413.88 A: yeah 

413.16 416.67 B: rather than just be stupid [laughter] 

414.94 420.39 A: yeah sometimes ah people like to wallow in a pool of their own ignorance like my uncle 

420.44 423.55 B: exactly people like that are a little hard to tolerate 

424.16 426.73 A: my uncle's a fascist 

427.13 433.88 A: yeah my uncle's just a dirt bag i don't even really consider him my family 

430.38 431.47 B: [laughter] 

433.92 436.52 B: yeah i've got some family like that 

435.92 437.10 A: i'm sorry 

436.93 438.01 B: (( [laughter] )) 

438.79 443.42 A: so sam if you could change one thing about your family what would you change and why 

444.08 455.60 A: well i would start by going back in time to when i was a rebellious ah seventeen eighteen year old and i would really try and appreciate my parents more and uh 

454.09 456.41 B: [laughter] 

455.75 461.17 A: you know 'cause sometimes they would do stuff that really pissed me off but in retrospect 

461.56 464.78 A: most of the time it was in my best interest [mn] that's 

466.07 467.02 B: (( well )) 

469.94 471.44 A: (( a that's a pretty good answer yeah )) 

471.42 472.96 B: that's pretty interesting 

474.87 478.04 A: (( than- thanks sam yeah )) 

480.60 481.52 A: (( when i )) 

480.75 483.42 B: [laughter] personally personally i thought that most of the 

483.51 488.60 B: insane stuff i did as a teenager was a growing experience i wouldn't take any of it back [laughter] [laughter] 

489.07 493.89 A: originally yeah i mean i probably wouldn't either but uh 

494.01 497.70 A: you know i think i gave my parents a lot of unnecessary grief 

498.27 499.29 B: yeah 

499.08 500.07 A: and now 

499.79 500.95 B: i hear that 

500.53 508.44 A: i'm coming to that point in my life where i view them not only as parents but friends as well and i can see uh 

508.65 516.88 A: a lot of my own stupidity in growing up and and i can appreciate their their love and grace a lot more now 

517.18 518.18 B: sure 

518.49 522.95 A: when i originally posed this question my answer was going to be that i wished that my dad could breath 

523.54 529.06 A: fire 'cause then when people are making me mad i'd say back off 'cause i'll have my dad come and breath fire on you 

528.77 530.11 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

531.26 534.05 B: well you know that would that could be handy 

533.82 536.49 A: mhm because then you figure 

536.62 541.73 A: if my dad breathes fire and it's genetic then i would probably also be able to breath fire 

542.22 547.86 B: in all likelihood you might have to hit puberty or something but [laughter] then you'd be able to breath fire 

545.25 545.97 A: (( [mn] )) 

548.47 550.19 A: uh what 

549.76 551.46 B: [laughter] 

550.38 555.21 A: yeah i i could see that as sort of a coming of age of sorts 

556.14 561.38 A: when you breath your first fire are you guys trying to suggest that i'm prepubescent 

561.82 564.70 A: uh well it was the 

564.13 569.39 B: no we're talking about you went back in time to your childhood we're not saying you're prepubescent now 

569.26 573.91 A: yeah but you posed the breathing fire theoretically and 

573.31 574.41 B: exactly 

574.07 578.54 A: you really don't breath fire at this point but yeah 

580.24 582.20 A: (( okay i concede )) 

586.37 587.74 A: yeah 

589.26 593.93 B: yeah but um i don't know i never actually wanted to breath fire as a child myself 

593.46 595.61 A: mhm what did you want to do 

596.47 599.89 B: [sigh] um what did i want to do as a child i don't know
