64.09 65.02 A: so 

64.14 66.37 B: wow that that must be difficult 

66.15 75.51 A: it is it is 'cause as far as family my parents are pass have passed away and my brother lives in chicago so i really don't have a close family 

75.43 84.22 A: which which is too bad it's not what i would have wanted for a family it's not what it wasn't my idea of a family when i was growing up i wanted you know a close 

75.45 76.36 B: uh-huh 

84.47 87.44 A: a close family but i guess that doesn't always happen 

88.01 102.51 B: that's true that's true actually i um although my family is is much smaller i'm the ones that are but i do have i'm not very close to them either so i can i can understand that but ah i guess i i look forward to having a family of my own some day 

101.97 110.82 A: right right well my sons my i have one son that has got three kids and then the other three sons two aren't married they live with their 

110.72 121.71 A: significant others and the i have another son who's been married seven years but they have both have great careers so i don't know about kids it's hard to say so i don't 

112.35 113.28 B: uh-huh 

119.61 120.66 B: right 

121.77 125.58 A: know i guess and and you have so many ah you know 

125.60 129.29 A: what's the word i want stuck parents and um 

130.17 133.25 A: oh what's joined families you know ah 

133.44 137.48 A: i don't know what the word family it's not like it used to be for me anyway [laughter] 

137.83 147.35 B: right that's true um in fact sometimes i'm not close with my blood relations i do consider some of my closer friends more so my family 

146.85 157.50 A: you've got it you've got it because i know i spend a lot of time with i have a a friend who is actually much younger than i am but his family and i are are very close 

157.36 163.38 A: so they kind of adopted me and i spend holidays with them and more so than my own family so 

163.62 170.65 A: i guess i guess the word family means a lot of different things or can can mean a lot of different things 

170.92 179.72 B: um that's true that's true in fact my my boyfriend's family has somewhat adopted me already even though we're not you know engaged or married yet so 

179.74 182.35 B: like you know i certainly see what you mean mhm 

179.79 180.82 A: (( but )) 

181.96 189.29 A: that makes it nice makes it nice if you're close i i know i i was i have been married twice and my both in laws were 

189.33 198.01 A: i was very close to them and ah they make you know 'cause my mother i am i am from canada and my mother lives up there and i live down in the states so 

198.15 201.11 A: it was nice to have like a second set of parents 

201.59 203.47 A: on both sides so 

203.51 205.46 A: i was lucky in that you 

205.62 208.50 A: know that way we did get along really well 

209.26 218.38 A: but no i don't know if i don't think i i i assume you said you have got a boyfriend so you haven't got children obviously yet 

217.86 219.74 B: right not yet no 

218.71 224.56 A: though nowadays that doesn't seem to be the case either [laughter] [laughter] 

221.34 227.99 B: that's true i [laughter] that's true there are a lot of families with ah that don't have married parents 

225.83 233.03 A: i know they have the kids first and then get married i know [laughter] and i'm from the era where i'm still not quite with 

229.24 230.94 B: [laughter] 

233.41 234.58 B: (( [laughter] back )) 

234.61 235.92 B: (( when it was the other way around )) 

235.02 240.30 A: (( that [laughter] but ah )) 

237.53 238.63 B: [laughter] 

240.32 245.62 A: i i i don't know how i feel [laughter] but i have mixed feelings but 

245.01 255.70 B: oh well i i mean i i feel that it's that it that it can work out i mean people might have difficult circumstances especially if it was an unplanned child but 

255.01 256.10 A: right 

255.76 257.78 B: but i mean i i even know 

257.78 259.95 B: couples who are not married who 

259.93 272.82 B: plan to and had children even before they were married and that wasn't a purposeful thing you know and it's worked out for them so i mean i think they have they have great families even if it may not be like a traditional nuclear 

264.47 265.44 A: right 

267.20 268.15 A: right 

272.99 274.53 B: family used to be 

274.69 283.88 A: i know it's it's funny 'cause i was brought up in a very conservative family we were very and no such word as divorce in our family and ah 

283.90 285.36 A: you know we were 

285.94 292.79 A: i i won't say religious fanatics 'cause that wasn't the case but it was church every sunday you know and sunday school and 

291.20 292.15 B: uh-huh 

292.69 301.17 A: it was just it was just so very different than what it is now and even my own kids i brought my own you know my own children up very differently so 

301.20 304.65 A: but i wouldn't i wouldn't trade my childhood for anything 

304.87 319.65 A: nothing not when i look back and i see what's going on nowadays it's like no i'm i'm glad i had the type of childhood my dad died when i was fourteen so obviously it changed rather you know when i was young but and my mom never remarried 

314.31 315.74 B: mhm 

317.07 318.02 B: right 

319.98 320.97 A: (( so )) 

320.09 321.05 B: uh-huh 

320.81 325.85 A: you know i i did miss the man's influence in my life i think that's why i've been married twice 

325.66 336.26 A: [laughter] so [laughter] i don't think i learned how to get along with them [laughter] [laughter] 

326.48 327.80 B: [laughter] 

331.64 334.73 B: [laughter] 

335.13 338.60 B: oh no well i guess one really never knows what 

338.67 340.74 B: what caused that [laughter] 

339.73 349.88 A: no no i i think i became very strong though and and strong willed and strong you know opinionated [laughter] and i wasn't a yes yes person so 

349.92 351.42 B: mhm 

349.95 355.93 A: um and the kind of men that i happened to be attracted to were the type that didn't you know 

355.98 359.65 A: that i guess wanted to be in control so it was always a 

358.81 359.70 B: (( mm )) 

360.43 368.65 A: no my kids have my kids have all married strong women isn't it it's funny how you look you look and you see we are i guess we are what we're 

368.79 371.08 A: we are a product of our 

371.91 373.90 A: (( ah you know bringing up )) 

374.22 376.93 B: oh that's true i mean you can definitely see how your 

376.98 382.77 B: family shapes you for the for the better or worse and you can see it reflected in 

378.75 379.77 A: (( yeah )) 

380.03 382.12 A: yeah very much so 

383.06 385.00 B: future ah generations as well 

384.61 388.46 A: right very much so in fact i married two only children 

388.83 390.17 A: and um 

391.83 406.68 A: well i don't know i have as i say i come from i have a brother but it just seemed that i was drowned and you know even now men that i dated have never been married both of them are only children and it's like whoa there's something wrong here 

404.32 406.01 B: [laughter] 

406.93 410.28 A: (( because i i happen to i would i would like i would )) 

407.16 408.25 B: yeah 

410.80 414.22 A: like my family to be closer i really would 

413.86 415.27 B: mhm 

414.27 422.52 A: you know big family get togethers and i envy i envy people like that my dad was one of twelve so

427.76 428.78 B: yeah 

430.85 434.58 A: yeah i come from a fairly good sized family but 

434.28 442.53 B: mm i'd i'd always wished that i had a a sibling it's ah difficult being only child in many ways and of course 

442.44 452.65 B: you know everyone else especially when you're you're kids they say oh you're so lucky you get everything and yeah it's true i had eve- i was spoiled and you know i was able to 

447.07 448.61 A: mhm 

452.68 466.04 B: you know get everything just for me but you know it's just not the same not having someone someone around so i know that if i have one child i'd definitely have to have one more [laughter] because i don't i don't want just to have an only child 

456.32 458.18 A: right right 

462.20 463.91 A: one more yeah 

465.47 479.36 A: right i always said that too and i didn't plan on four but [laughter] [laughter] i always said that you know i would have liked two that was my plan way back but ah but my brother and i i mean there was two of us but we are not close at all 

469.04 470.22 B: [laughter] 

479.27 481.92 A: you know and you would think we would be because he's 

479.65 480.78 B: mhm 

482.06 484.14 A: you know we're we're the only living 

484.38 496.32 A: of you know of this generation and ah we both have parents that you know have passed on but no no we're not i tried not like i didn't want it and not like i didn't try but it just 

496.32 507.94 A: he was a workaholic or he is a workaholic and he just doesn't have time for anything but you know work and his own family he is close to you know his immediate family but yeah 

504.90 506.34 B: mhm 

507.21 511.30 B: were you able to rely upon each other when your parents passed 

511.41 513.00 B: at that time in your life 

512.33 524.65 A: well my dad died when i was fourteen and my brother was eighteen and he did he supported my mother and i until i got out of high school so he was very good yeah yeah and ah 

520.30 521.22 B: wow 

524.54 536.51 A: he's been there for me several times but he's just ah he's not an outgoing person like i am he's he's quiet and he would never be doing what i'm doing now [laughter] 

531.45 532.49 B: mhm 

536.49 543.02 A: he is just we're just very two dif- you'd never know we come from the same parents never

543.51 555.17 A: he has done very well with his life he has had a great career and he set goals and he went after them me i kind of floundered and my my idea was going to get married have my kids my little 

555.11 564.68 A: house with the white picket fence you know that's that's what i wanted back then that's i would have been very happy but unfortunately the first man that i married didn't feel that way 

557.09 559.05 B: right 

561.12 562.64 B: mhm 

565.62 571.34 A: he didn't really want kids so that was a big bone of contention 

565.65 566.75 B: (( yeah )) 

571.73 576.94 A: and even though we had three he didn't want the responsibility so 

578.32 579.20 A: (( but )) 

580.31 583.41 A: and he doesn't have anything to do with them now so
