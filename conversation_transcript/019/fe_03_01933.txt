95.06 97.74 A: oh that's so cool it's like 

96.10 97.90 B: yeah yeah we started 

97.81 99.25 A: (( a storybook ))

107.10 108.47 A: wow okay 

107.56 110.83 B: we've been married since nineteen ninety eight so we've been together for twenty years

125.39 126.44 A: wow 

129.87 131.00 A: (( wow )) 

134.94 144.28 B: and i'm a stay at home mum because i believe that if you can afford to have either the husband or wife stay home 

144.46 155.09 B: the children to me in my opinion because this is this is what i was raised up in uh mum was a stay at home mum and my dad he worked so 

155.08 167.90 B: i think that a child gets that one on one attention starting from birth up until you know whenever there is that one on one attention there's that security that either mum or dad is always gonna 

165.96 167.16 A: right 

168.13 177.95 B: be there and and it's really i mean my husband and i started dating and talking about marriage and everything like that that's one thing we talked about in the beginning 

168.14 169.48 A: awesome 

177.84 190.61 B: when we start having children we want to be somewhat financially okay where as you know i could at least stay home and stay home with with our son or either stay home and work from home 

182.34 183.44 A: sure 

190.38 191.34 A: right 

190.73 194.34 B: and be there with him at least until he gets in school all day 

194.69 204.62 B: and then that'd be first grade and then what i'll do then is i'll go to work after i get him to school and then hopefully i'll have a job where i'll get out and be home by the time he gets home [laughter] 

203.96 205.24 A: that's great 

204.55 210.86 B: yeah but family it's it's it's everything to me and um i talked to my brothers and sisters 

211.58 215.77 B: [sigh] i mean a different one every night i have one in florida 

213.86 215.01 A: (( wow ))

224.22 234.66 B: yeah i'm in michigan i'm about twenty miles out from um detroit i'm in a suburb called flinton township yes so what about your family what does your family mean to you 

230.31 231.40 A: nice 

233.90 244.76 A: well a lot of the things that you said are extremely similar and a lot of things that are extremely converse um i'm uh i'm actually thirty three 

236.21 237.23 B: mhm 

240.43 241.61 B: yes 

244.16 245.14 B: okay 

244.77 253.75 A: and uh i have two children but first i guess i should say that family to me if you could put it in two words it would probably mean 

253.84 256.13 A: unconditional nurturing 

255.59 256.70 B: yes 

256.23 259.40 A: and you know 'cause nurturing goes along with love 

257.04 258.55 B: oh 

259.02 260.58 B: oh yeah 

259.59 262.76 A: i'm a i'm actually a i'm an only child 

262.21 263.44 B: okay 

262.79 268.88 A: um my dad comes from a family of seven and my mum actually has nine 

265.88 266.81 B: okay 

268.53 270.04 B: wow 

269.27 273.92 A: so and everybody else on both sides have more than one child 

273.23 278.06 B: really the lord blessed them with you an only child 

273.98 275.36 A: yeah so 

275.83 276.72 A: (( yep )) 

277.44 284.25 A: yeah and uh i actually have a a three year old a daughter and a five month old 

278.27 279.41 B: okay 

280.83 281.76 B: okay 

283.76 285.50 B: (( oh you have an )) 

286.06 287.03 B: (( infant )) 

286.32 290.11 A: yeah i have an infant i have a five month old son yes 

287.71 289.46 B: aren't they precious 

289.53 293.20 B: aren't they i mean children are precious aren't the newborns amazing 

292.55 297.57 A: ah they're they're they're the most uh they're the best commodities we absolutely have 

294.62 296.06 B: oh 

296.94 300.74 B: oh i know you're in awe 

297.71 299.76 A: yeah there's nothing like it 

300.31 301.93 A: i i am and 

301.36 311.84 B: no matter how bad your day's going when you make it home and look at those children's faces like every thing that you've gone through to to take care of them and make a living is worth it 

302.57 303.57 A: (( uh-huh )) 

305.73 306.67 A: yeah 

306.69 307.60 A: it's 

309.89 313.76 A: so minimized it is it absolutely it it's gone 

312.55 317.03 B: and even if you've had a bad day when you look at their faces it don't even matter no more 

316.36 318.42 A: it really doesn't and love it 

317.39 319.83 B: and their faces can brighten up the whole room 

319.04 328.78 A: right like you my wife uh and i are both professionals but my wife um gave up her career and she is stays home with our son and daughter 

323.42 324.59 B: mhm 

328.22 330.73 B: oh god that's great 

328.91 332.30 A: and that's very very important to us 

331.51 335.12 B: you know what people don't realise how important that is 

334.46 336.73 A: i i couldn't agree with you more 

335.34 338.30 B: i know the economy is in in 

338.37 347.76 B: a kind of the desperate state and really takes two incomes you know like with myself i was in telecommunications my husband is a detroit police officer 

339.86 340.83 A: right 

342.59 343.57 A: right 

347.06 348.31 A: okay 

347.89 353.41 B: so i had some complications when i when i became pregnant and that was in two thousand and then i 

353.19 365.90 B: i had well i became became pregnant in ninety nine i had blair in two thousand and i've been home with him ever since so we've kind of had to really you know lay back some things and really budget and so forth because he's the only one working 

356.88 357.75 A: uh-huh 

365.75 371.03 B: uh outside the home i recently started working inside the home doing some market research 

370.36 375.03 A: that's so unbelievable that's that's so does my wife [laughter] 

373.59 374.84 B: (( mhm )) 

374.98 386.30 B: but you know what i believe [sigh] in my opinion i believe sometimes when one parent at least stays home and does the beginning years the child is 

386.74 388.06 B: much more 

388.47 398.30 B: when they do get in school and when they do start going to kindergarten and getting around other people i believe they're much more they're independent and they all much more secure and grounded 

397.62 401.22 A: and you that's what i was going to say they're much more in tune with their emotions 

400.61 402.38 B: exactly 

401.71 404.09 A: they they understand consequences 

403.41 405.11 B: exactly 

404.13 408.68 A: i i couldn't agree with you anymore anymore on that topic 

406.59 418.11 B: exactly a- and you know and it makes it makes a big difference too when that child gets in school and that teacher says you know okay i see where mum has been working with her i see where dad has been working 

417.61 418.74 A: right 

418.19 428.76 B: god he's excelled and i mean he can really speak well and you know he knows this he knows his colors that stands out because why one of the parents is at home 

428.43 434.80 A: because again back to that unconditional nurturing twenty four seven three sixty five no matter what 

431.49 432.74 B: exactly 

433.70 435.32 B: exactly 

434.83 437.50 A: and that that is you can't put a price on it 

436.78 438.31 B: (( no that's right )) 

437.77 447.47 A: and even if like day care was free and it was great it still wouldn't be the same and day care you know in itself i think it's a necessary entity but i don't think that they're 

440.43 441.70 B: there's still not 

441.93 442.83 B: no 

446.85 453.07 B: you know i used i used to work in the day care field and when i was working there i would always say 

453.14 456.54 B: that is going to be a last alternative for my child 

455.46 457.26 A: (( yeah absolutely )) 

457.06 465.24 B: the ratio is one to ten i mean ten you know ten children on one teacher so and as the kids get older the ratio becomes higher 

464.79 465.78 A: right 

465.15 475.74 B: and i mean you really can't give each of those kids your undivided attention at all times someone is gonna miss out on something somewhere 

472.36 473.07 A: (( no )) 

475.28 477.04 A: right exactly 

476.30 481.11 B: you know becky's gonna have to cry while the teacher goes over there and attends to lucy and johnny 

480.68 482.76 A: and it's easier and that's in 

482.86 486.36 A: how they slip through the cracks all the way up you know 

484.59 499.49 B: exactly exactly you know when i used to work in the day care centre i used to try to just make it my business to try to give each kid as much as i could all of the love and nurturing that i could because 

486.80 487.86 A: (( wh- )) 

499.50 507.48 B: i really felt for them mum would come in leave them at six o'clock in the morning mum is the last one or dad's the last one to pick them up at six o'clock in the evening 

506.43 508.50 A: right at six o'clock in the evening 

507.86 510.24 B: and that's a long day 

509.56 512.58 A: right they're with the kids for you know three four hours 

511.84 518.19 B: that's a long and this one lady actually brought her son in who was six weeks old 

518.53 519.78 A: that's a sin 

519.65 520.91 B: and he got 

519.94 523.40 A: i mean it's not a sin i guess for some people it's what they have to do 

521.74 529.67 B: she had and she had to do it but it's just oh and she would come in crying every morning tears in her eyes she could hardly leave him 

529.28 530.69 A: yeah i bet 

529.76 534.82 B: you know she leave him so i mean i said at that point when i have kids 

535.04 541.45 B: we just have to struggle need to cut back on a few things but i'm going to be home with mine 

536.66 538.16 A: (( right right )) 

538.64 539.94 A: (( exactly )) 

541.12 547.70 A: it's so worth it because you it's worth cutting a few pointers and and and we actually just bought a house last year 

542.30 543.41 B: it is 

547.12 548.95 B: okay congratulations 

547.78 549.99 A: we're thank you and we're um 

550.37 555.83 A: you know we are not doing as many things we are not buying as many things we're not indulging as much but it's 

553.33 554.39 B: (( mhm )) 

554.84 555.75 B: mhm 

555.95 560.02 A: not you don't really even think about it it's like just so worth it 

557.42 558.49 B: no 

558.83 562.77 B: no you really don't you're in a whole you're in a whole different 

562.32 563.33 A: (( yep )) 

562.88 570.96 B: frame of mind you know because your most important thing is the welfare and the safety of your children 

563.59 565.17 A: yep it really is 

570.45 577.95 A: yeah that's in some ways you know that's kind of a purpose maybe of it all you know every your whole perspective changes 

574.61 575.64 B: mhm 

577.24 579.83 B: you know what that's a good way of looking at this 

579.25 580.89 A: it really is 

580.08 593.63 B: it's a good way of looking at and when things get hard for me and my husband and he's like you know we really need two pay cheques coming in here and i i'm doing this and i'm doing that and i say okay honey i understand but look how intelligent blaire is 

593.19 594.29 A: right 

593.89 599.89 B: he can count to forty he just turned three so he knows all of his colors all of his a._b._c. 

596.70 597.51 A: (( yeah )) 

598.21 599.89 A: that's really cool
