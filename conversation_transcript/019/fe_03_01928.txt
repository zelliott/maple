45.85 54.60 A: [mn] well not yet um one of them i home schooled my children through the sixth grade yeah and then 

51.67 53.16 B: oh really 

53.47 55.79 B: i never knew anyone who did that 

55.31 67.35 A: i loved it i would do it again in a heartbeat it was really a lot of ah well it was just a good opportunity for me to to be able to know what my children were learning and 

57.81 58.82 B: (( um )) 

67.22 77.62 A: and just to be able to spend time with them but when they went when when my son was it was time for him to go or when he was turning thirteen and getting ready to go to seventh grade 

77.63 82.23 A: i really wasn't equipped to teach him at home any more so he went to a private school 

81.75 82.70 B: uh-huh 

82.72 92.85 A: and and then he's a a football player and a baseball player and he wanted to play five eight ball so he ended up going to public school when he was a ninth grader and she 

93.17 103.48 A: ah when he was in ninth grade was in ah turning seventh grade so she went to the same private he did but next year they're going to be at the same school he'll be a senior and she'll be a sophomore

104.54 106.46 A: yeah it's really um 

107.08 110.41 A: and actually the reason we did that was to um 

110.63 117.70 A: to let her enjoy and she's also an athlete so she'll be playing ah varsity soccer 

117.94 125.39 A: they could be at the same school and enjoy each other playing and ah they're very close so it's it's 

125.45 128.79 A: i'm i'm happy that she'll be at the same school with him 

127.58 134.00 B: that's nice my daughter is ah my daughter played softball up until a couple of years ago she played 

134.04 137.76 B: i guess from the time she was six till she was fourteen 

137.57 140.30 A: is that right why did she quit 

138.38 139.58 B: mhm 

140.32 148.27 B: [sigh] because all of the people who were managing the girls' teams moved out of the neighborhood and nobody took it over it was really sad 

147.70 148.87 A: oh 

148.28 149.47 B: mhm 

149.11 150.72 A: now did you ah 

151.24 154.22 A: [mn] did you play is that how she got interested in 

153.02 162.74 B: no i didn't play at all i never played any sports um [mn] i had i had a friend and ah they put fliers through the neighborhood 

162.66 171.21 B: and my girlfriend was getting her granddaughter into it and she told me about it so we walked them up and signed them up for it that first year just for you know something for them to do 

170.82 172.26 A: mhm 

171.71 180.71 B: and then she liked it and she was good at it and she got a lot of trophies and she got ah best defensive player she was good mhm 

178.90 181.80 A: really and then she quit 

181.51 182.93 B: yeah well 

182.01 185.02 A: i mean was there no other way that she could have found 

183.88 197.44 B: she could have done it in school but she kind of lost interest she didn't want to play in school i think it was kind of the neighborhood thing and then a lot of the players weren't around any more you know the neighborhood changed so 

197.21 198.29 A: right 

197.69 207.64 B: you know she didn't really want to do it in school and the only option she had which i paid for her to sign up was to play baseball and she would have been the only girl 

207.47 208.45 A: (( well )) 

207.69 212.08 B: and then a lot of people told me not to let her do it cause she was going to get hurt 

211.52 212.47 A: well 

212.30 218.38 B: playing with the boys so i just put an end to it i was sad 'cause i used to like to go see her play 

214.04 215.15 A: right 

215.48 216.58 A: but but 

217.82 222.37 A: oh i know that's that's what i i really am going to miss when 

222.56 234.09 A: my son is gone [mn] it it really is a wonderful opportunity to to go and watch them perform and not only that but all their buddies that they've basically grown up with 

233.37 234.90 B: right 

234.47 238.51 A: are still on the same team i mean that's really fun 

236.67 237.67 B: that's 

237.91 240.15 B: that happened with her but 

240.36 244.71 B: ah most of the girls she was on the team with moved out of the neighborhoods so 

244.62 245.70 A: mhm 

244.83 247.15 B: it was just a bad situation 

247.07 250.23 A: right so is she involved in anything else at school
