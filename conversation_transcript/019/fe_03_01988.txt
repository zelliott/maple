12.89 15.07 A: and is this your first time in the study 

14.71 16.20 B: yes it is 

16.39 20.34 A: oh we have quite a topic here today what do you think of the corporate 

21.07 22.80 A: illegal activity 

23.20 36.56 B: well i think it's gotten way out of hand because they hadn't hadn't policed it up until ah they they got ah you know until it got out of hand they could've been doing something about that 

35.57 39.39 A: what do you think our government can do to help police the corporate activity 

39.91 44.42 B: well now i i think that they they they can do a lot of things with it now because 

44.64 52.04 B: they got a constant watch on it and they got the police that ah the police watch on it 

52.62 55.14 B: (( [mn] and ah )) 

55.40 59.19 B: that's all they have to do is keep keep on top of that now 

59.69 62.61 B: and i think they can erase all of that 

62.15 66.69 A: do you think high collar blue collar white collar crime has risen in the past few years 

66.82 68.06 B: ah did what 

67.74 69.09 A: has it risen 

69.22 70.85 A: or have we just been more 

69.26 77.67 B: yes it has it it is really risen in the last well i think they've had it all along but they just caught up with it 

75.96 78.24 A: so we've just been more aware of it now 

77.80 80.56 B: yeah right 

80.12 82.38 A: has it affected you personally 

82.93 85.59 B: (( well not well it is affected of us )) 

85.75 89.24 B: (( personally )) 

88.05 91.62 A: and what do you think we as as a general public can do 

92.07 94.23 B: well ah 

96.58 107.29 B: well the general public ah they can stay ah right ah abreast with it i mean by ah keeping a watch on it 

108.00 109.07 B: and ah 

108.07 112.38 A: do you do you think we should boycott certain companies that have had the problem 

112.83 116.23 B: well i don't think you should really boycott it but ah 

116.51 121.56 B: the ones that are really been into it ah the government's taking care of it 

122.16 124.91 A: and is that a responsibility of our government 

123.85 126.48 B: i think it is 

127.24 130.85 B: cause they're supposed to keep things like that in check you know 

131.65 137.93 A: [mn] so i think i think personally that it's been going on for a long time it's just that we're more aware of it now 

135.52 139.12 B: it has been they just caught up with it they just caught up with it 

138.93 145.37 A: and we've just we're just becoming more aware of it now due to the different media that wasn't always available in the past 

145.11 146.91 B: right 

146.33 155.41 A: i definitely feel that's an issue i don't think that i i think that we have seen perhaps rising costs because of some of the issues 

155.38 164.14 B: oh yes definitely definitely so yeah especially especially ah the ah the ele- electricity thing 

155.42 156.99 A: (( that are passed )) 

157.39 159.68 A: (( consumers and )) 

166.03 166.78 A: yes 

167.09 169.39 A: that i think that's a very big issue 

169.60 174.17 A: and the cost has passed down to us so we have seen it from that end of it also 

174.31 175.62 B: yeah 

174.99 177.21 A: i also think perhaps that 

177.90 179.84 A: we don't do enough 

180.50 185.85 A: i don't know per se what we could do to change it [noise] but i think perhaps that we 

187.48 191.40 A: general big business gets away with too much 

190.91 192.25 B: yes they do 

192.06 204.32 A: and i don't think they pay their fair share of the taxes i think that we need to make the general businesses and big businesses more responsible for the fair share of taxes rather than the brunt being to the working person 

204.01 205.71 B: that's true 

207.11 210.88 A: so i'm trying to see i i'm not sure 

211.61 216.46 A: where we could do this but if if the tax pays line up 

216.81 224.70 A: and they were held more responsible for some of the issues that have been in time i don't think that necessarily that they are being held responsible 

224.81 226.29 B: they're not being 

225.37 226.28 A: (( [cough] )) 

226.92 229.97 A: it's always being passed down to a different person 

230.26 236.23 A: whereas the true culprit responsible is not being is not being given the brunt of the punishment 

235.99 238.31 B: you're right 

236.82 240.25 A: i think perhaps that we see 

241.04 248.03 B: oh listen ah is it possible i got i gotta to urinate i'm sitting on the bed it it'll be about one minute 

249.02 250.03 B: hello 

249.86 250.70 A: yes 

260.64 263.28 B: (( [noise] )) 

328.46 330.12 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

328.47 329.51 B: hello 

330.20 335.18 B: yeah well the reason for that it i'm handicapped i'm paralyzed on one side 

335.56 338.36 B: due to a stroke i had ten years ago 

338.78 342.26 A: well that's okay we all have to do our duty [laughter] [mn] 

342.01 345.58 B: you're right well that's why i had to tell you you know 

346.27 348.85 A: yeah i don't know i think 

349.03 360.56 A: i don't necessarily know how specific we can make changes but i do think that it it is an issue in our economy today do you feel that the economy has taken a a downward trend because of some of these issues 

359.23 367.82 B: it it really has it's taken ah a big beating because of that all that money them billions of dollars 

367.83 370.70 B: it it the stock market has really suffered 

370.82 375.12 B: so have all the people that has that has the stocks and stuff 

374.87 375.88 A: yeah 

377.20 385.90 B: well they got ah two or three of the big fish and i i think if they stay right on top of this they'll they'll get some more 

386.00 395.60 A: yes i do i think they need to be able to uh you know pull these people out but at the same point in time i i also think that the corporations that are the worst offenders are being 

396.24 398.37 A: they're given more leniency 

398.04 400.30 B: yeah they're being slapped on the hands 

399.86 404.05 A: and i don't think it it's necessarily a strong deterrent for them 

404.34 414.02 A: and i also see that perhaps they're having each corporation is using what is you know called a called a scape goat where the true people responsible for the decision making are not paying the price 

413.64 420.21 B: well they have deterred a lot of it by punishing the ones that has gotten caught i mean the big ones 

421.66 426.17 B: but it really haven't stopped haven't stopped at all 

427.25 429.73 A: no i don't know do you think it can stop 

430.07 432.60 A: i mean if it's something we're always going to have 

430.27 435.15 B: well i don't know well i don't know whether they can stop it all 

435.21 440.33 B: (( but ah they they can do a pretty job on it )) 

440.46 445.95 B: it all depends on how they handle them now and how they punish them 

446.10 450.39 A: and do you think do you have you seen punishments that fit the crime right now 

446.23 446.94 B: w- 

450.84 452.64 B: no i don't think so 

453.01 456.19 A: [noise] do you think the punishments will be a strong deterrent for them 

456.72 459.26 B: (( i think it it it is being )) 

459.62 464.63 B: i don't know what the future might hold but it it stopped a lot of it 

463.54 465.58 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

465.03 467.94 B: when they when they ah got the big men 

467.95 473.69 B: and they seen what they do to them the ones right behind it they they believe ah 

473.86 477.42 B: really slow it down they're not going to stop it completely because 

477.50 485.09 B: a lot of that stuff is done under the table and the big people think that they they did enough not to get caught well 

485.42 499.74 A: yeah i don't believe they're going to be a list out but i think i mean i think we can stop some of it but i do think that the majority is under the table and the pocket books are always going to be big enough and human nature being what we are there are always going to be somebody willing to accept money for 

499.44 507.25 B: that's right that's right because that that almighty dollar is so big that's what it's all about 

499.72 501.08 A: a wrong deed 

506.88 514.14 A: yes and i think that we're going to have and and i mean i don't think that we can ever get rid of that innate greed that people have 

514.29 519.60 A: and it's not everyone but there's always going to be a certain percentage of the general population that's going to have it 

518.58 520.50 B: that's right that's right 

520.24 529.50 A: i think we could cut down on that but i i don't see it disappearing as a whole in the future i think it's something [noise] we're always going to deal with 

525.84 527.14 B: naw i don't either 

528.70 533.09 B: look at barbara stewart i mean ah ah what her name 

534.23 535.36 A: streisand [noise] 

535.63 539.79 B: no what's the lady's name miss stewart the one 

539.91 545.41 B: that that they had ah she's a billionaire a self made billionaire 

545.48 550.91 B: martha stewart yeah they didn't done anything they haven't done anything to her 

545.57 548.19 A: oh martha martha yeah 

551.30 555.94 B: they said that ah that a lot of people say that they're not going to do anything to her 

556.07 559.05 B: she knows too many big people in in the high places 

559.60 560.94 B: and that's wrong 

560.79 569.33 A: yes if it was inside trading it was but i think maybe perhaps it's an issue of that that they can't prove it that's another issue i think that they're facing with the corporate 

567.48 570.81 B: (( well they have to be able to prove it in order to do anything about it )) 

570.39 573.35 A: right is that they're going to have a hard time proving [noise] 

575.59 580.90 A: i think that is another issue that they're going to have is that some of these crimes are going to be unprovable 

580.54 587.92 B: (( that's right and if they're un- if they're unprovable they'll be unpunished )) 

582.09 583.23 A: [noise] 

584.10 585.79 A: and that is an issue 

587.44 588.82 A: exactly 

589.30 594.51 A: [noise] i think it's going to be very difficult finding proof companies are getting [noise] more and more 

595.26 596.95 A: sneaky [laughter] 

597.41 599.89 A: with you know issuing specific memorandums
