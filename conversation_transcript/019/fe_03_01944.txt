26.79 40.38 B: unconditional love is extremely important [noise] when it comes to family and family members [noise] [noise] um i am a mother [noise] and are a grandmother and [noise] my children grandchildren will always have unconditional love from me i will be there for them 

32.01 33.52 A: mhm

51.09 52.35 A: mhm 

52.65 54.30 A: mhm

65.76 67.03 A: mhm 

69.94 76.89 A: well i think like you that it's it's really important it's a support system and ah place kinda a safe haven 

75.85 78.66 B: [noise] mhm [noise] 

76.90 86.70 A: um i i'm a mother a single mother and i guess i i feel like single parent family is just as important as a two parent family um 

86.98 99.77 A: i think you know there can be various organizations of family but the important thing would be that there is cohesion that there's caring that there's mutual support um 

100.22 113.65 A: empathy um and well like you um there were some problems shall we say with my family when i was growing up some dysfunction and but i think that we i think that's not that uncommon to tell the truth and 

103.02 105.64 B: [noise] 

107.87 109.13 B: right 

113.90 122.07 A: and i'm just hoping that in my family that i've had with my children it's been less so although my daughter is sitting right here and i don't know what she would say but anyway 

120.84 123.26 B: [laughter] [laughter]

125.39 127.70 B: oh right great great 

126.66 127.48 A: um 

128.08 133.21 B: i think families today are a whole lot different than families of yesterday you know 

128.09 129.27 A: anyway 

132.10 138.00 A: [mn] well that's really true there's been such a broadening of definitions of of what family is 

136.01 136.94 B: right 

137.78 145.05 B: and and family doesn't necessarily to me have to be ah blood family member um i consider some of my friends 

145.01 148.68 B: because i don't have family um my friends are my family 

148.48 160.12 B: um you know my best friend ah she calls me mom and and i'm she's family to me i mean there's nothing in the world that i wouldn't do for her in fact um she's more family to me than some of my family is you 

148.50 150.30 A: mhm mhm 

154.00 155.30 A: mhm 

159.93 172.13 B: know um so like you said there are different ah aspects or branches of family and um you know god there's so many different things out there there's groups of people that call themselves families you know 

159.95 160.89 A: (( ahah )) 

170.79 172.27 A: mhm true 

172.16 174.21 B: cults and things like that 

173.79 174.89 A: yeah 

174.42 175.29 B: i 

175.23 185.50 B: in a way you know i know how different is it is now some of the things in the olden days it seems like families were a lot closer to each other um back in the olden days um 

185.33 186.35 A: mhm 

185.37 190.39 B: you know even go back to the covered wagon days or days of the indians everybody was always together 

190.16 193.92 B: ah they did everything together they lived together um they just 

193.70 205.93 B: it just seemed like ah there was more of a bond there than ah nowadays i don't know if it's a baby boom generation or what it's but ah the families have grown apart and family values don't ah 

201.92 203.13 A: (( [mn] well )) 

203.20 204.19 A: yeah 

205.73 216.11 B: seem to mean so much um even with one of my own children um one is really good and one is really bad and the bad one unfortunately is my daughter and 

212.69 213.81 A: mhm 

216.21 228.03 B: it hurts it doesn't family doesn't seem to mean anything to her except for when she needs something you know she talks bad to me ah she wants to fight with me she doesn't want to listen to me um 

220.53 221.49 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

221.89 223.17 A: mhm 

227.90 231.93 B: and i i wish that things were different that you know i could 

232.39 246.48 B: i'm i'm there for her whether she knows it or not but i wish she could feel that bond more you know um more with me than i don't know who so she's trusting or talking to i'm sure she's got somebody you know but i just i wish that i could be that family person um 

236.93 237.85 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

246.07 247.01 A: right 

246.49 251.48 B: in my own family my mom um she committed suicide when i was to fourteen so i lost her 

250.35 251.96 A: mhm mhm 

251.51 263.17 B: my dad i haven't seen him in twenty years um he's in another state but he doesn't i don't he doesn't even know me but he doesn't like me because i ride motorcycles and so 

258.85 259.98 A: mhm 

262.51 263.92 A: oh [laughter] 

263.05 272.50 B: ah harley davidsons and i wear a leather jacket so he's classified me as you know i guess a hell's angle or something like that which i have absolutely nothing to do with anybody like that i'm a great person 

264.80 265.67 A: (( ahah )) 

268.64 269.57 A: (( ahah ahah )) 

272.42 283.04 B: but the family [noise] the family values just don't seem to be there any more and um [noise] and i don't know what we can do to change that um you know except for 

272.47 273.30 A: (( ahah mhm )) 

283.13 292.23 B: keep trying and love our family love our friends love people ah show respect to everybody and just hope for the best i guess you know [laughter] 

291.05 295.17 A: yeah yeah you know when you were talking earlier i was thinking about um 

295.21 300.29 A: you know in the olden days when families were closer and i really think that the struggle to survive 

300.12 301.25 A: was so 

301.07 311.82 A: intense that people had to really pull together and in more recent years maybe like after post world war two there was a lot more prosperity and 

310.70 311.76 B: mhm [noise] 

311.61 318.12 A: and kids tend to be much more indulged and maybe just don't you know feel that need so much to pull together 

314.64 315.77 B: [noise] 

315.88 319.52 B: [noise] right [noise] yeah um [noise] i would think 

318.51 319.09 A: (( mhm )) 

319.54 324.82 B: ah that some of the other countries i mean even go over there and look at ah iraq and what's going on 

324.61 327.92 B: and how those people [noise] and those families how they live um 

327.72 338.97 B: that those families are probably a lot closer than our families because [noise] like you said they have the survival [noise] thing you know that they bond together [noise] because they have to take care of each other [noise] and that's all they have and here 

330.52 331.69 A: mhm 

334.41 335.40 A: yeah 

338.79 347.02 B: in the united states there's so much there and so much distractions and ah other things [noise] or opportunities or whatever that 

346.81 360.02 B: um the kids and people nowadays are so involved in everything else that they don't even worry about their families you know they just don't seem to have the time or the concern for them um which is you know that's that's sad too but 

352.89 354.75 A: mhm mhm 

359.73 360.99 A: mhm 

359.82 362.98 B: that's just the way it's [laughter] i guess [laughter] 

362.00 367.55 A: yeah yeah you know and i think um the other thing that i was thinking of when you were talking is that when um 

367.45 372.01 A: families have not been really close or maybe have had a lot of strife or or 

371.78 382.84 A: pain in them i think that those the people who grew up in those families do reach out more to friends and i know that to me some of my friends have meant more than my my sister or brothers certainly um 

381.53 383.87 B: right right 

382.76 389.13 A: just because my sister and brother just aren't close with me but some of my friends really are and [noise] [noise] 

386.35 396.88 B: right and that's sad th- that's sad i mean but like i said it's the way it is you know so we have to go to other means for our 

389.56 391.07 A: mhm 

396.74 400.33 B: to feel good and have people we can trust and confide in you know and 

400.15 400.94 A: (( ahah mhm )) 

400.17 403.36 B: our families should be able to be there and that's why i'm hoping that 

403.14 410.22 B: you know i can be there for my children and my grandchildren and in fact i'm going to try extra hard and that word unconditional um 

410.00 424.63 B: means a lot to me um to love somebody um unconditionally no matter what you know you may not like them or like some of the things that they do but to love them and still be there and support em and pick em up if you need to or whatever you know um i think 

412.14 413.19 A: mhm 

418.20 418.79 A: (( [noise] )) 

424.60 437.90 B: in each every family that's the way people should be with their family members is no matter what because that's your family you can't change your family no matter what you know and and you need to be there for em and for each other um 

431.14 432.15 A: (( [noise] mhm [cough] )) 

433.84 434.78 A: right 

438.21 439.66 B: i don't know um 

440.03 453.55 B: i just [noise] just hope the world gets better and you know i hope best for my life and everybody else's you know i don't know if there's anything i with do to help somebody but um you know if i could help a family ah i definitely would you know 

453.04 454.53 A: (( mhm mhm mhm mhm )) 

453.85 454.96 B: definitely 

454.89 465.94 A: well you know and when you were talking about your daughter i'm kinda wondering if maybe that's just a stage she's going through in her maturation that at some point she may value her ties to you her 

465.93 470.34 A: relationship with you more than she does right now i don't know how old 

469.11 470.38 B: i hope so 

470.53 471.94 A: (( she is but )) 

470.88 477.35 B: she just lost her child ah to protected services and she lives in another state and ah she's not 

474.07 475.86 A: oh that's sad 

476.00 476.75 A: (( ahah mhm )) 

477.29 491.74 B: doing anything right to try and get her son back which is just killing me you know and there is nothing that they will let me do about it they're just gonna keep him in custody up there for a while and i mean if i could have him and they no 

479.03 479.92 A: (( mhm )) 

487.92 490.81 A: mhm they won't study you 

490.86 501.95 A: i work in child protection services in texas and normally well under texas law we study family members family are considered to be the first choice above foster parents 

497.26 498.79 B: (( right )) 

500.54 514.95 B: right um i've had some ah problems in my own life so so even though i'm extremely stable now and i'm married and everything is going great for me it's they as you know they look at your past and if there's problems in your past and 

503.89 505.23 A: okay so 

506.31 507.27 A: right 

511.69 513.24 A: right and they may 

514.71 519.88 B: they're just not gonna allow this little boy to go to anybody that has any kind of a past 

519.46 520.55 A: mhm 

519.77 529.03 B: you know and i guess if you even looked at my my family family's past going down the line from my mother and her parents were ah dysfunctional and then 

528.34 529.47 A: mhm 

528.86 542.39 B: she was dysfunctional and then my own family is dysfunctional and now my daughter's dysfunctional and even though i got my act together it's just ah it's it's a never ending cycle and it's really it's sad it's hard you know 

533.41 534.64 A: mhm 

536.34 537.83 A: mhm 

541.59 544.52 A: mhm ahah are they letting you stay in touch with the child 

543.90 552.37 B: um i i have no way to you know if i want to fly up to oregon and see him once a week in a child services um office or something that would be the only 

547.67 548.58 A: (( mhm )) 

551.35 554.68 A: mhm which would be pretty hard yeah mhm 

552.63 553.45 B: (( way )) 

553.47 558.44 B: right he's been there for like three months now so i'm not quite sure what's going to happen with him you 

557.53 558.55 A: (( mhm mhm right [noise] )) 

558.34 562.07 B: know i guess every is still open there um 

561.84 574.15 B: we don't know he's probably even going to be to his grandparents down in arizona which at least he'll be with family in fact i i was offered to call um you know the parents down there because they didn't know what was going on the grandparents to say hey your 

572.83 573.75 A: (( ahah )) 

573.98 577.16 B: grandson is in child services i can't get him can you 

576.95 587.76 B: and even though we're not we don't communicate or know each other hardly at all i would rather see my grandson with some kind of family than with no kind of family or no kind of blood because 

580.27 581.64 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

583.61 584.50 A: yes 

587.52 599.95 B: even foster homes and foster families um you know that's not necessarily the best way to grow up but there are some good ones you know i'm sure there's lots of good people out there that would love um love to have a little kid that you know it's definitely 

595.11 596.24 A: right
