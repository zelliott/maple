0.16 1.66 A: donna stajack 

1.70 3.35 B: hi joe mccarthy 

3.41 4.63 A: hi how are you doing 

4.39 5.94 B: good how about yourself 

5.75 10.34 A: oh just fine thank you a little surprised about the topic [laughter] i wasn't too sure i couldn't hear it at first but 

9.72 12.36 B: [laughter] kind of a different [laughter] 

10.45 11.76 A: [laughter] 

11.83 13.05 A: yes it was 

13.88 18.35 A: but i guess i should say how it affects me i don't know i think it affects me in gosh every way 

18.38 19.24 A: (( um )) 

19.53 24.82 A: all of the prices of things going up and i don't know [laughter] 

25.33 32.30 B: well they let's just review review the topic basic the first thing they said was the illegal 

33.18 36.60 B: ah activity in business basically is what they said or 

35.98 37.95 A: (( mhm i i do believe so )) 

38.17 41.70 B: so what would that involve i mean stealing or 

42.89 43.60 B: (( what )) 

43.14 48.34 A: [noise] to me i'm thinking they're talking probably about like enron which i live close to i'm in houston i don't know where you're at but 

49.20 51.37 A: so to me that's my opinion on that part 

51.91 53.16 A: so if that's the case 

52.18 57.95 B: so basically scandals scandals within companies right [noise] yeah 

55.81 58.65 A: that's what i'm thinking i'm not positive ah 

58.72 60.30 A: i didn't receive like a 

60.62 64.87 A: pretty much a letter or email you know detailing everything that goes on with it but 

65.22 66.84 A: i know in our you know in our 

67.20 69.54 A: town it's it's pretty big 

69.80 73.48 A: and to me you know it's just i know it's hurt a lot of people that that have been around me 

72.69 73.80 B: (( i'm on the phone )) 

74.72 78.30 A: hurt their you know their pay checks and things like that [noise] 

78.85 80.71 B: (( yeah well )) 

81.24 85.38 B: [cough] i guess basically what i'm thinking is that 

85.77 88.41 B: if there's scandals in companies 

88.62 97.88 B: all i don't know [laughter] it's hard to say what i'm thinking but it's just first of all it's unbelievable how how people get away with that kind of thing 

97.56 99.08 A: oh i agree there [laughter] 

97.90 100.70 B: (( you know how does it affect me )) 

100.77 102.78 B: how does it affect me i mean 

103.12 106.68 B: personally it doesn't i don't i don't think it really affects me 

107.23 111.29 B: it personally but the economy i guess it would be 

111.89 116.05 B: you know all these people lose their jobs because there's a few 

116.34 121.17 B: people in a business that want to try to make themselves rich 

121.31 123.65 B: i guess in that way it would affect me 

123.19 137.59 A: well true yeah i mean myself no i don't i don't really know anybody personally i know that you know i've talked to other people that i've known you know other people which i guess you could say and it has affected them to the effect well one they are unemployed which also hurts our economy ourselves 

136.99 138.51 B: (( uh-huh right )) 

137.75 141.90 A: so and plus i i have known with with reading and things like that 

141.93 150.39 A: that with the enron scandal oh my gosh that the money that they've lost the people have you know built their things on 401k and and stocks and bonds and 

149.76 151.52 B: and then they have nothing 

151.16 156.66 A: yeah they're completely broke and that was their their whole life is involved around that i know if it was for me 

156.71 164.77 A: and if i had you know had a 401k and all of a sudden it went bankrupt and all my money was gone i'd be terribly upset myself 

164.21 167.59 B: [laughter] yeah yeah 

164.85 166.23 A: [laughter] 

168.03 171.70 A: so i guess i could say that's how it affects me i suppose i mean 

171.88 176.05 B: i was having trouble kee- keeping up with the like there was different 

176.25 183.69 B: things that the topic was about others like how it affects you or i or did you catch the other parts of 

182.77 183.75 A: right 

183.88 185.51 A: well the economy i know it 

185.53 187.56 A: it was hard to hear it myself here so 

187.30 188.31 B: (( it )) 

187.67 194.68 A: sometimes there's background noise here but i i believe they were saying i don't know how it affects your economy or how it affects you or 

195.45 206.02 A: i suppose we're supposed to be continuing talking about you know our economy i mean i don't know that's pretty much the only biggest thing i could think it would be enron but i know there's a lot of other companies that are 

198.03 199.08 B: yeah 

206.66 207.81 A: you know where the 

208.06 211.27 A: whether it be c._e._o.s or somebody down below there that are 

211.44 213.91 A: taking advantage of the people [noise] 

214.41 216.36 B: [cough] well like 

217.12 219.37 B: what's another one like ah 

219.60 225.29 B: like the ah mcdonald's scandal you know about that with the monopoly thing 

223.26 224.38 A: oh yes yes 

224.63 228.71 A: definitely yes i cannot believe that [laughter] 

227.70 228.81 B: i mean 

229.40 232.41 B: that affects 

235.44 238.00 B: people's trust you know what i mean 

237.71 239.16 A: right definitely 

238.35 244.56 B: so like say you are going to mcdonald's and you think you're going to be eligible to win a car or a million dollars 

244.89 252.59 B: and and you go in and you do you know you do this for a year you know what i mean or whatever i mean whatever they run the thing for a month you know 

252.00 252.97 A: mhm 

252.77 261.72 B: so so you've been buying all their products and half the reason why you went in there was to try to win you know yeah you're hungry but you you thought you had a chance to win something 

260.89 271.45 A: yeah yeah i understand my family was like my kids were like please take us to mcdonald's we can you know try to win this i need one more my stepdaughter's like fifteen i need that one piece park place 

267.18 272.72 B: right yeah i need the i need the railroad and i win a vehicle or whatever 

271.81 285.50 A: yeah just give me park place that's all i need or you know we were the same way okay okay we'll go ahead and buy you this you know you had to buy a certain amount of or a certain type of item we were the same way we definitely went in and did that and yeah we were duped the whole way through 

285.45 288.73 A: that that definitely disappointed me now they're wondering why they're um 

288.10 289.85 B: yeah 

288.81 290.30 A: they're having problems 

290.14 291.07 B: well 

290.90 292.06 A: [laughter] 

292.24 298.20 B: well i will tell you right now that that one affects me because i work for mcdonald's [laughter] 

296.76 299.73 A: oh do you really [laughter] 

298.75 300.26 B: so so 

300.59 304.27 B: you know what i mean it it affects me personally because 

305.35 316.72 B: first of all it makes me look like i'm part you know i mean obviously i'm not but i mean it makes me you know i'm a mcdonald's employee i don't think people look at me like i'm a big thief or anything but 

316.62 327.35 A: unless you were the person that that was part of you know that had the hand in the dealings of all that i think you're probably okay there [laughter] you might not think that i can understand your point there definitely 

316.74 318.25 B: maybe they think 

322.28 324.97 B: (( [laughter] )) 

327.12 328.70 B: (( so ah you know )) 

327.87 330.08 A: i mean that had to be hard on you mhm 

329.95 332.71 B: well yeah it was very disappointing you know 

332.84 339.90 B: and and you know just recently we were running another um it's not monopoly or anything but it's another game you know what i mean 

339.79 341.98 A: oh are they i didn't know that 

340.22 347.00 B: where you can win where you can win stuff you know but i just wonder i've had several people say well yeah i don't think there's any prizes 

347.09 348.32 A: [laughter] 

347.95 350.34 B: just because you know [noise] 

350.03 351.83 A: and that hurts mcdonald's doesn't it 

351.61 353.78 B: well it hurts mcdonald's it hurts 

353.49 355.68 A: your sales i mean it hurts yeah 

354.73 366.94 B: well it hurts your sales it hurts it hurts the everybody that's connected with mcdonald's you know what i mean well we buy this and that from everybody else so if we're not selling quite as much or whatever well then you 

367.37 369.62 B: know what i mean it affects them too you know 

369.09 380.39 A: well then it's been a while 'cause i have to admit though i do kind of work not work for mcdonald's but i have done some secret shopper jobs for mcdonald's thank goodness you don't think remember my name [laughter] hopefully or where i live 

379.18 381.94 B: you actually were a shopper you're you do that now 

380.88 388.78 A: yeah i do that yeah i do that now yeah oh gosh now i wonder if i can't i don't really know you so i i guess it will be okay you know i do the secret shopping for mcdonald's 

388.40 391.26 B: that's awesome that's very interesting 

389.19 390.05 A: yeah 

391.18 402.21 A: but i have not i know isn't that strange but i've never really thought about that when i go to do the job like oh look at this oh look at this company you know how it duped us but to me i don't think of mcdonald's duping us i think of a few people 

402.13 412.89 A: that have done that so so really it hasn't affected me in that way but that's where mcdonald's itself i imagine it's affected you know affected their business that's what i'm saying i have been reading about it i know their business has suffered 

403.17 404.25 B: yeah 

413.03 422.07 A: that's for sure and you know they're not building as new as many this is what i'm reading in the paper here now they're not building as many new or redoing mcdonald's and things like that so 

417.04 419.07 B: yeah i read that stuff 

422.40 424.30 A: (( but i do secret shopping for mcdonald's )) 

423.89 426.09 B: that's that is very interesting 

425.38 430.86 A: isn't that weird but as the economy no as for how their scandal has affected me no 

431.08 432.55 A: i still pretty much you know 

432.75 434.67 A: after that i went a little leery 

434.79 439.72 A: but i still you know went to mcdonald's because my kids wanted a you know big mac [laughter] 

438.94 442.52 B: yeah i mean most people don't go for those games and stuff but i 

442.43 444.07 A: but um you know it's 

443.57 446.80 B: mean what other scandals has there been i'm just trying to think of any 

446.62 447.77 A: i i i'm 

447.86 450.56 A: (( sure there's tons [laughter] yeah )) 

449.73 455.13 B: we could talk about president clinton but i don't know if you want to go there [laughter] 

452.62 456.83 A: [laughter] no kidding hey i voted for that guy what a fool you know 

456.26 459.10 B: (( [laughter] well [mn] )) 

457.19 459.35 A: goodness gracious what did i do 

460.07 464.63 B: government is business and that was definitely a scandal of sorts you 

463.49 473.19 A: yes yes it was you're absolutely right but i do kind of feel bad for you if you're a mcdonald's employee there not not now though 'cause i imagine from what i can see they've bounced back 

465.52 466.33 B: know 

473.13 481.54 B: yeah i think we've i think that the i think that the the shopping thing has kind of put everybody on their toes so to speak 

481.23 482.47 A: mhm 

481.78 483.55 B: yeah i have 

484.59 486.92 B: have you noticed i mean do you 

487.68 488.70 B: i guess 

488.85 492.39 B: do you do the same stores or do you do different ones or 

492.02 498.82 A: [noise] oh i do different ones all the time yeah it depends i can only do them like once a month or once every two months i have probably done about six of them 

493.57 494.72 B: (( okay oh )) 

498.69 499.65 B: (( okay )) 

498.81 507.20 A: so it varies like i said though but i guess i'm lucky that i haven't really thought about the scandal any more when i first heard about it i was looking at all my pieces thinking 

503.85 504.77 B: uh-huh 

507.16 516.26 A: you know i was duped this is ridiculous but then i also thought that wait a minute now it wasn't the whole mcdonald's company it was just i think it was just two guys or two people or whatever 

514.80 518.85 B: well it was a separate it was a separate entity altogether yeah 

518.38 521.03 A: that's right it was the people that were doing the business 

519.42 523.30 B: they hired it out yeah they hired out another company 

523.54 531.93 B: that that basically handled the prizes and you know and all the packaging and all that and 

529.09 529.94 A: right 

530.54 536.91 A: yeah who didn't stop me now the enron thing like i said the only reason that was affecting me is because forino is my town 

537.00 538.59 A: and watching people 

539.67 542.55 A: sorry lose all their money that that's the part that was affecting me 

543.03 543.99 A: that you know 

544.00 546.59 A: just watching people lose thousands or 

546.64 551.47 A: hundreds of thousands of dollars i mean i've heard about people saying well all my savings was in there and i had you know 

551.12 552.66 B: right 

552.00 557.43 A: three hundred and fifty thousand dollars and you know tied up in all their stocks and things like that and the next thing they know right 

556.29 559.01 B: (( so how do you how do you even )) 

559.13 572.85 B: trust i guess i guess to me the way it affects me the the most out of everything would be my trust for anybody that's in some kind of authority 

573.60 582.59 B: figure type thing you know like the upper executives or the people that were in charge of the [cough] pack- you know the the prizes and that all that 

582.16 583.55 A: yeah but it has power 

584.07 596.73 A: the economy makes they can do whatever they want to do that's hiring practices you know quite well i don't like that person okay he might be the most qualified or whatever i just don't like that person so i'm sorry you know or you're fired because you know you don't think the way i do 

586.53 587.51 B: (( that's )) 

597.06 599.89 A: so that's the part that worries me about all this it's
