40.01 47.89 B: 'cause you know the government has to bail all of these ah corporations out and then it costs all of us 

47.64 48.86 A: right 

48.14 49.15 B: so

76.92 77.60 A: ah 

79.55 89.51 B: so it's very you know it's very hard to to you know hear all of these things going on and um you know and here 

89.51 98.09 B: you know my husband's working sixty seventy hours a week and you know and you know when i hear about all this corruption 

93.73 94.82 A: right 

98.17 105.41 B: and ah the taxes in our area are you know really really high and you know and i just think you know 

105.43 108.05 B: you know all this is going on you know 

108.28 109.23 B: so 

110.95 111.85 B: um 

111.05 113.11 A: well i think that um 

115.05 129.67 A: for one they need to get the corrupt people out of office [laughter] um you know that could put a stop to some of it because i know that you know how how are they doing this all by themselves the government has to be involved somehow 

119.24 120.26 B: mhm 

129.59 130.59 B: mm 

131.46 134.71 A: um i mean you know maybe not 

135.22 139.35 A: to the fullest but you know they talk about the 

139.90 144.36 A: the crimes you know stuff getting over the border and things like that well 

144.37 148.23 A: there are corrupt government officials that let it get over the border 

148.23 149.20 B: right 

149.49 151.47 B: yeah and um 

151.97 156.33 B: you know but there's there's only so much that um 

156.52 164.94 B: you know that you know we're trying to control everything in all of our lives you know in all of our lives and um 

162.54 163.70 A: right 

165.23 167.56 B: you know and so um 

167.70 168.54 B: you know 

168.71 176.54 B: like there's so much money that has to go to other things and that's why there's not enough money for the borders to protect the borders 

177.03 178.60 B: and um 

178.61 185.91 B: so you know that goes on too i mean they've had to cut down on the amount of people that can be watching over the borders 

185.75 186.68 A: right 

187.51 195.18 B: but that could also be because we've spent so money so much money bailing out you know all these corporations [laughter] 

195.63 196.61 B: so 

195.70 198.80 A: yeah and they're the one they're the ones that 

198.83 202.22 A: is doing illegal activity and then 

202.36 214.71 A: you know we indict them and then we just pass it off and they get cleared in the free and and i read an article in the paper where the government paid them back you know so much money 

203.91 204.81 B: mhm 

215.12 218.33 A: you know corporate businesses get more money than 

218.45 223.25 A: anybody i know and they're as far as taxes and the i._r._s. and things like that 

222.93 223.94 B: right 

223.35 225.68 A: and um you know 

225.79 226.67 A: us 

226.77 228.31 A: you know middle class 

228.34 230.63 A: families we're sitting here with 

230.71 232.59 A: you know nothing 

232.54 233.55 B: mm 

232.96 240.65 A: and why the corporate businesses they get in trouble um and then they're back in business a couple of weeks later 

240.02 243.51 B: yeah with a new name and yeah 

241.16 242.25 A: right 

243.86 245.53 B: and ah yeah 

245.83 249.19 B: but you know somebody else you know 

249.25 261.03 B: like these small and small businesses they may do the exact thing as these corporate you know corporations and you know people go to jail 

260.42 266.27 A: yeah and it's because they don't have enough money and the government wants somebody with money so they can 

261.10 261.94 B: but 

266.31 271.01 A: in return receive more taxes from the bigger corporations 

270.49 271.49 B: mm

352.45 353.36 A: right 

354.73 355.66 B: but 

356.77 364.19 B: i feel like the economy is always better when a democrat is in office [laughter] so you know i mean at least i 

364.27 365.19 B: (( mean i'm )) 

365.21 371.19 B: talking i mean i'm really not that old i mean i'm thirty something years old so but what you know from 

371.29 374.12 B: from the time that i remember back 

374.16 376.29 B: you know it always seemed like 

376.39 379.46 B: i always did better under a democrat 

380.39 387.00 B: but then i wouldn't really want a democrat in office when i was you know when we were in the midsts of a war so 

386.67 387.76 A: yeah 

389.42 391.76 B: [laughter] that's just that's just my opinion 

392.97 397.98 A: um how do you think we can crack down on the corporate scandals 

395.23 396.21 B: [laughter] 

398.40 399.56 B: um 

401.53 402.54 B: [sigh] 

402.58 403.72 B: well 

404.18 412.64 A: i mean not we as the people but you know um maybe we can write letters to our senator about you know what 

412.85 418.30 A: our position is and how we think they should go about doing it i mean sometimes they do listen to 

418.70 419.57 B: mm 

418.71 420.18 A: smaller people 

420.31 421.62 B: and um 

421.80 435.05 B: you know what and i think it really has to be put down on paper exactly how this affects families you know if somebody really if they actually looked at it and you know and saw how 

435.35 442.27 B: you know how we could you know we are spending so much money on this kind of thing and um 

442.70 447.54 B: you know and you know and there's so many programs that we could be giving that money to 

447.17 448.14 A: (( right yeah )) 

447.56 449.11 B: to help people 

449.52 451.73 B: and it's really unfortunate 

452.61 453.84 B: you know but 

454.60 463.07 B: you know when we get when you know when they're we're at our country is in the midsts of you know a huge corporate scandal 

463.13 467.21 B: you know everybody's looking to how how do we get out of it 

467.43 471.35 B: you know how is this gonna be how is this gonna be taken care of 

470.81 475.66 A: right instead of just taking responsibility for what they've done to begin with 

471.46 472.42 B: (( you know )) 

475.09 476.00 B: mm 

475.87 481.74 A: and then they pay these high high you know attorneys millions of dollars to get them off 

481.49 482.49 B: mm 

482.10 483.25 A: and 

483.35 488.62 A: so there's more money wasted over something they know they've done to begin with 

489.06 492.71 A: and you know um 

489.09 490.06 B: right 

492.15 503.64 B: and then it just it sets it sets up other con- other companies to do the exact same thing 'cause you know they're like well you know we'll get away with it and ah 

504.45 506.59 B: you know and that's unfortunate 

506.98 508.71 A: right you live in a big city 

508.53 510.58 B: no we live in a small town

544.11 545.13 B: mhm 

546.68 547.64 A: um 

548.27 552.09 A: i think us taxpayers are the ones that are paying to 

554.72 555.94 A: not to 

556.46 562.10 A: i think we should be paying more to prevent it and we're actually paying to

588.63 597.32 B: you know i mean people just go back to doing what they were going what they were doing you know it doesn't last very long
