0.61 1.80 B: helen 

1.79 2.91 A: jenna 

4.77 9.67 A: ah so the topic is corporate conduct in the u._s. 

9.07 10.01 B: mhm 

9.88 12.14 A: um how has this affected you 

12.25 17.18 B: um it's it has affected it hasn't affected me per se 

17.38 29.52 B: but um [noise] i realize that over the last couple of years there have been like a lot of mergers and acquisitions and um you know like companies like enron and n._c._i. where 

29.46 34.40 B: people you know [noise] end up losing their jobs their investments 

34.46 37.57 B: all because of the corporate you know the conduct [noise] 

37.75 39.67 B: the businesses are conducting 

39.74 50.71 A: that's true and enron and also um martha stuart with that scandal that happened ah actually somebody i know has stock in martha stuart so it definitely affected that person 

44.20 45.29 B: yeah 

48.40 49.69 B: wow [noise] 

50.98 64.49 A: that ah conduct i guess they think they are very they're immune like these these rich people they sort of think they're immune from being found out um but ah the enron thing and the martha stuart thing proved that that's not true that ah 

57.54 58.41 B: yeah 

62.17 63.64 B: [noise] 

64.77 72.67 A: that anyone is susceptible but i wonder if this has had anything to do with the recession do you think that ah it has had something to do with the recession or 

72.19 76.70 B: i don't um i don't know if it per se has anything to do with the recession but 

76.54 88.43 B: i think that their conduct because now you know companies are not seen in the same light that they were seen before and i think because of the way that these businesses are conducting themselves 

86.49 87.38 A: (( not )) 

88.44 91.10 B: they are making themselves appear 

91.36 95.23 B: you know i mean that i'm pretty sure that's not going to help the economy 

95.48 97.88 A: mhm that's true that's true 

97.07 105.24 B: you know because i mean you have um all across the board like even with the acquisitions and everything that has been happening i mean 

105.29 118.53 B: the salaries of c- c._e._o.s has like doubled and tripled and understanding that they play a large part into you know the success of the company but it it doesn't exactly say that they are sometimes not aware of 

109.18 110.13 A: mhm 

118.54 123.38 B: the any if any illegal activity that has been going on 

123.29 124.48 A: mhm 

124.33 128.51 B: so i think you know there has to be a place where you can [noise] kind of draw the line 

130.07 132.37 A: yeah that's true that's true 

131.76 137.63 B: and say okay well you know this is going on but i think that the there has to be more you know 

137.66 145.46 B: government monitoring [noise] and even then it's it's still left because it's human beings that are doing it because it's like 

139.51 141.27 A: yeah 

145.64 148.70 B: i think it was yesterday in the newspaper here in new york 

148.84 152.13 B: had a whole bunch of judges [noise] accepting money 

153.02 155.02 B: for doing divorces 

155.08 160.07 B: the lawyers are paying the you know the the the judges under the table 

161.03 163.04 A: i had hadn't read about that really 

163.11 165.87 B: yeah and it just came out yesterday 

165.69 166.36 A: (( mm )) 

166.03 169.82 B: so i think or this morning but it's just you know as long as 

169.90 179.86 B: you know the person is willing to do the dirty business and someone is allows them to do it you know for the sake of collecting money then there's always going to be 

180.15 182.05 B: you know laws are going to be broken 

182.05 194.89 A: yeah i mean i think i think president bush said something about ah when enron and all those things first happened that they were coming up with some kind of law or something or some kind of something he was going to come up with to ah to sort of stop this from happening but 

194.70 197.67 A: i i don't quite remember what it was and i know he said something 

197.40 198.62 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

197.77 208.71 A: but i mean i think like that enron example and the martha stuart example i think it's been um a learning lesson to all these different companies you know that you can't do these kind of things you can't have illegal practices 

209.05 209.95 A: so 

210.19 214.43 A: you know you would think that they would have maybe learned by the others' experience 

213.61 220.92 B: [laughter] but i think that they're all many are driven by the dollar [noise] and as long as [noise] okay thanks 

221.02 224.44 B: as long as you're driven by the dollar you know 

224.45 235.01 B: the company may be willing to do whatever it takes to make the dollars like i used to work for a company before where we had to verify people's employment status 

235.09 241.78 B: and we had there were like one or two members at the job who were forging other people's signatures 

243.05 244.36 B: you know and 

244.66 250.45 B: as time passed on it was then discovered that it it was one of the unwritten 

250.52 256.13 B: you know policies of the company whatever brings in the money just do whatever brings in the money 

255.76 256.60 A: (( mm )) 

256.71 264.36 B: you know so as long as things like that happen [noise] it's hard to say that illegal activity you know won't go on 

264.50 265.69 A: mhm 

265.07 274.49 B: there's always people that want to want to rise to the top and if the way to rise to the top is by being a brown noser or doing special jobs then 

274.63 275.49 B: you know 

275.65 278.33 B: there's always going to be somebody around to do the dirty work 

277.84 283.73 A: yeah you can't you can't sort of put a law on human nature and what human people do yeah that's true 

281.30 282.80 B: exactly 

283.56 295.47 B: and you know it's hard even with the government because then you have even like politicians you know you did when they are running for office it comes out you know the news is more you know comes out even faster but 

295.44 303.68 B: they sometimes accept money that even when they need to pass a bill or something you know [noise] people make gifts and donations and you know 

304.32 313.82 B: you know they use that as an excuse but sometimes it's just in order for them to vote in the way that whoever you know whatever company they are involved with 

313.85 315.47 B: to kind of you know 

315.87 320.41 B: use that to get a vote or to get a decision passed their way 

320.20 321.62 A: mhm 

321.52 323.87 B: so you know it's kinda hard 

323.74 337.33 A: i wonder if like this is i mean i'm sure i i don't read that much but if they you know i don't know if this happens in other countries talking about corporate conduct in the u._s. i wonder if it's like as bad in other countries too or if they maybe have better rules or 

337.66 350.98 A: you know it seems to be but it seems to be very prevalent in the u._s. with all the examples but i can't think if there are any other people i mean all i think of is enron and martha stuart when i think of you know legal illegal business practices 

350.79 363.66 B: yeah i don't know because i i mean i'm studying human resources now so it's kind of hard because there isn't much to read about on global you know global cor- corporations i mean 

364.25 365.70 B: that global 

366.22 369.58 B: the way that the you know the united states has had to 

369.58 382.01 B: globally expand to other parts of the world as well has also affected the economy because they can't conduct business the same way as before now there's more competitors and even to the simplest things i mean 

376.78 378.08 A: mm mm [cough] 

381.98 386.81 B: you can find [noise] fifty thousand different brands of soap 

386.82 391.81 B: so you know that when you start thinking like that somebody is not making the money 

392.26 402.75 B: and you know when you go to the store i mean you have so many choices and variety so you know every company is not going to be able to stay on top because everybody's not going to be able to purchase 

402.73 407.43 B: you know we're not all going to purchase the same soap or maybe three or four or five of them 

408.40 413.21 B: so i think that also affects it and they really haven't made 

413.35 418.14 B: any text books that i know of on how you know other countries 

418.49 423.83 B: do their um their business globally i know the salaries like of c._e._o.s 

423.96 427.59 B: are not across the board in the global countries 

428.59 435.64 B: so if the salaries are there's not that need to make the money there's probably not that need to you know 

436.55 439.10 B: do illegal activity 

439.64 450.28 B: and i i'm also pretty sure ah the the expenses are not that high because i mean the last couple of years i mean rents have doubled tripled you know 

450.33 454.73 B: people are spending more have to make more people are now working 

454.78 457.21 B: where before maybe you only had a one 

457.76 462.95 B: one person in the household who could work and support the family nowadays it mostly takes two people 

463.03 464.89 A: that's true yeah 

464.28 474.85 B: so with expenses and everything going on you know people have to work even harder and at the same token you kind of understand why somebody might want to do something illegal just you know 

474.89 477.25 B: to make a little extra money or to be a little 

477.47 479.81 B: you know have that peace of mind 

479.93 482.17 B: or be able to provide for their family 

481.97 496.60 A: yeah that's it's like the conditions of you know financial financial conditions today with the recession and with also with the war recently and all that it sort of creates a climate where people are more likely to do these kind of illegal business activities 

489.99 491.14 B: mhm 

493.88 495.29 B: [noise] 

496.03 502.31 B: mhm i mean i was even overhearing people today on the train and they were talking about um 

502.26 512.34 B: 'cause now with all the budget cuts i mean they want to cut unemployment people are now finding jobs and after they run their year up in unemployment guess what they're not entitled to any more benefits 

512.39 515.31 B: so it's going to become again where robberies were 

515.82 524.93 B: robberies had decreased over the last couple of years they're probably just going to go up because if people can't find jobs they got to [noise] feed you know they're going to do whatever it takes to feed their family 

524.78 525.61 A: (( yeah )) 

526.02 536.82 A: you're right you have all those cuts like bloomberg is making all the cuts different jobs and stuff and cutting cutting different things and after school programs and that kind of thing so it all just creates this kind of um 

531.16 532.72 B: mhm 

533.66 534.60 B: yeah 

537.41 546.67 A: this kind of financial situation where people are likely to do illegal business practices 'cause it's they're just interested in the dollar and not anything else really 

546.00 552.44 B: mhm and then the thing the funny part is that everybody is talking about how bad the economy like everything is nine eleven 

552.64 556.19 B: every company is always having these cuts um 

556.46 563.67 B: business is bad but you don't see people's salaries or at least you don't see the the lower class workers' salaries being 

564.18 565.26 B: um 

565.98 572.77 B: given substantial raises but however the top executives are getting large bonuses [noise] they're getting 

572.93 583.03 B: their regular percentages of raises so the business can't be doing that bad i mean there's other companies where even though they say you know business is bad 

582.95 591.65 B: but what they are actually doing instead of laying people off they actually will have them work instead of working five days a week come in and work four days a week 

591.99 595.01 B: that kind of stuff in order not to lay people off 

594.93 595.68 A: (( yes )) 

595.52 599.95 B: so it all depends on the standpoint of whoever is in the top position in what they feel like do
