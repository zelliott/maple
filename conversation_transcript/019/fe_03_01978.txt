1.80 4.67 B: hey amy my name's ben how are you 

4.43 5.62 A: good how are you 

5.59 11.00 B: good ah so that's ah a pretty difficult topic we have 

10.70 11.84 A: yes 

11.46 17.38 B: [laughter] are you ah i'm a i'm a i know a little bit about that stuff i'm a third year 

17.49 19.17 B: ah law student 

19.28 20.09 A: okay 

19.66 21.44 B: (( so ah do you )) 

21.63 22.52 B: and you're 

22.63 25.64 B: (( what sort of ah career do you have )) 

25.65 30.27 A: actually i work for a very large software company so um 

29.79 30.69 B: okay 

30.51 35.42 A: and actually this year we have been um affected financially at least 

35.88 38.13 A: a lot because of corporate 

38.15 39.01 B: yeah 

38.26 45.29 A: well the economy i don't and it's hard to pinpoint how much is related to um 

45.31 52.32 A: corporate scandal i guess but certainly our stock has gone down significantly this year which is very disappointing 

52.02 54.03 B: yeah there's i 

54.43 56.92 B: mean part of it ah 

56.96 67.17 B: you know i mean i think over the past few years you know there are folks on wall street that have sort of inflated expectations about companies 

67.20 74.26 B: and you know there was a couple of years there where there was where investment bankers were pretty much committing fraud 

74.69 76.09 B: (( you know )) 

76.10 86.11 B: in sort of the way they structured deals and ah and you know that pumped up the stock market but maybe that a lot of that was just sort of fake value 

86.44 87.19 B: (( you know )) 

86.52 87.37 A: right 

87.75 92.35 B: and you know and hopefully the government will ah 

92.42 93.65 B: (( you know ah )) 

93.67 94.98 B: go after 

95.12 100.89 B: the investment bankers and c._e._o.s that are um committing accounting fraud and all that stuff 

100.79 101.71 A: right 

101.38 102.30 B: (( so )) 

102.55 104.71 B: yeah i'm ah 

105.06 111.18 B: i i think you know that's the sort of ah scandals in the sense that you know they um 

111.30 120.20 B: that a lot of value was lost and a lot of ah money was sort of taken away from small investors and and ah put in 

120.55 122.96 B: you know investment bankers' pockets 

123.19 125.72 B: is is not a good thing you know 

126.20 129.74 A: yeah and i think it's hard to say because um it's probably 

130.01 136.98 A: there's so much going on in large corporations today that um that i think it's hard for anyone to really know how much 

137.65 144.85 A: maybe scandal or how much pocketing is going on of funds i mean you open the paper any day and you can see 

144.95 151.35 A: you know somebody that was committing some type of fraud um and it but i think it's hard to strike a balance between 

151.50 154.70 A: government's involvement and private corporations 

154.58 156.66 B: (( yeah yeah sure mhm )) 

154.84 155.83 A: to balance 

155.99 159.80 A: balance that out with people's investments and their own personal 

160.48 163.68 A: savings and well being i mean that's certainly huge so it's 

163.77 170.22 A: it's a fine line because um even for a publicly traded company it's still usually private corporation and 

170.73 173.82 A: i would hate to see government getting too involved in 

173.59 174.45 B: yeah 

173.83 178.24 A: in how companies run their their finances and their corporations 

177.61 184.93 B: yeah i think a a lot of it is ah accounting issues and um you know right now there 

181.94 182.97 A: mhm 

186.09 196.15 B: there used to be very little government oversight of accounting standards you know there was ah the federal accounting standards board or the and there was 

196.25 200.90 B: some private sort of industry accounting boards that monitored sort of how 

201.08 210.75 B: how accountants you know how so you know when a company makes makes a contract with a or sells some services they can either book it you know 

210.90 218.21 B: i mean a lot of this stuff came from the companies booking ah profits you know now when they should have booked them over twenty years 

218.08 229.20 B: so their balance statements looked looked a lot better to investors but it the so that their stock price went up and they made a lot money more money off their stock options but the reality was that they 

229.17 237.31 B: were sort of those were artificial accounting entries because they they weren't actually going to get the money for you know unless it was over twenty years 

237.57 241.50 B: and the accounting industry i think was sort of complicit in a lot of that sort of 

241.53 244.79 B: sort of loose standards that that ah were out there 

245.22 248.17 B: so so right now i guess um 

248.37 254.87 B: you know with with sarbanes oxley with legislation that the government passed and um 

255.49 261.30 B: with sarbanes oxley there's sort of this new accounting oversight board that ah 

261.36 263.48 B: which a few people were just appointed to 

264.34 266.19 A: okay what i'm sorry what are they called 

266.08 280.06 B: well i i'm not sure i'm not sure what it's called but there's um there it's sort of part it's sort of under the direction of the securities exchange commission there's there's this accounting board that's gonna that's gonna have some oversights sort of over 

274.81 275.78 A: (( oh okay )) 

280.38 285.72 B: over accounting standards now and there's so that one of the big questions is whether or not 

285.80 287.22 B: ah companies should 

287.24 289.76 B: have to account for stock options 

289.82 290.66 A: okay 

290.25 294.60 B: like when they like when a c._e._o. gets a hundred million of stock options now 

294.63 299.72 B: you know they don't have to put that on the balance sheet so investors so investors don't know 

301.17 302.13 B: you know how 

302.38 312.65 B: so a company could be making you know have twenty million in profits but be paying off thirty million to c._e._o.s in the form of stock options and um so 

307.06 308.10 A: right 

313.30 314.33 B: (( so there's )) 

314.43 315.43 B: right now 

315.60 319.89 B: right now nothing's happened about that so i'd like to see them you know ah 

319.99 328.00 B: force these companies to account for stock options and but i mean there's the concern of the government getting too involved you know 

327.78 330.52 A: it yeah there is 

331.12 339.16 A: my job i work as i mentioned for a software company and i work in support so um i deal with customers all day and um 

333.71 334.98 B: (( mhm wow )) 

339.17 350.22 A: as i mentioned it's a really large company and um all the fortune five hundred corporations are not all but i think i don't know like eighty seven per cent or something use our software to run their financial 

348.12 348.72 B: (( mhm )) 

350.25 360.05 A: um their sales and distribution and their marketing so i i mean i speak with customers all day and a lot of issues that come up with the software because it's very complex is um 

360.11 363.55 A: is really it's the financials and especially in the past i'd say 

363.65 365.58 A: less than a year or so 

365.52 374.36 A: there have been so many more issues that have come up in terms of quality assurance um and and regulation for finances 

374.16 389.15 A: and um for example enron has been mentioned i so many times just in talking to customers and they've even mentioned on a couple of occasions you know this is wouldn't have been an issue last year but you know we need resolution on this immediately because 

377.16 378.02 B: (( sure wow )) 

389.11 396.67 A: because we're so tightly regulated we're getting audited all the time and you know that's all based on on situations like enron 

396.69 399.45 A: so it's it's impacting on i think a lot of people 

399.19 400.32 B: mhm 

400.79 405.33 A: in in every facet of public corporation life anyway 

400.93 401.51 B: (( mhm )) 

405.23 419.22 B: yeah i guess so i mean i've read a few articles saying that sort of the chief financial officers of these big public companies their jobs are are like three times as hard as they were before sarbanes oxley 'cause ah 

419.28 428.90 B: they have to personally certify the company's financial statements under sort of penalty of going to prison or facing big fines and that wasn't the case 

423.68 424.50 A: mhm 

426.88 427.69 A: wow 

428.75 436.28 B: sort of prior to sarbanes oxley so they they really want to make sure they get it right and the problem is with accounting standards 

436.50 445.93 B: you know people there's so many things that are sort of questionable there's no accounting isn't clear at all you know because because um 

443.28 444.18 A: mhm 

446.26 447.41 B: (( you know there's )) 

447.51 451.79 B: items of income and ah assets that you know are 

452.10 466.70 B: there's sort of different ways that you can value them and several of them are sort of acceptable under business practices so so sarbanes oxley it's sort of it's come in there but it's created a lot of confusion for ah c._f._o.s because they 

465.78 466.47 A: (( mm )) 

466.84 471.67 B: you know they they want to make sure they're getting it right but it's um it's not really 

471.73 480.51 B: you know and a part of it is enron worldcom and a few other companies are sort of you know they're bad actors and ah 

480.55 486.53 B: i think most people most people think that most companies are not trying to engage in those sort of ah 

486.62 493.45 B: you know schemes so it's it's a shame that ah you know that more honest financial officers are having to 

493.46 496.66 B: you know deal with the fallout from enron but um 

496.36 502.79 A: mhm and i think it's hard too because especially someone at that level of management is involved in so many other 

502.72 506.87 A: other areas of management in managing the company even if it is the c._f._o. 

506.74 510.19 A: um so for them to actually personally certify that 

510.05 522.01 A: you know every fact of accounting is not so much even right or wrong or trying to be corrupt or or not right it's just to certify something of that magnitude it's 

511.52 512.50 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

522.01 527.55 A: i think it's too difficult because they wouldn't have been involved in the day to day daily operations in running 

527.55 541.31 A: you know the numbers for last month i mean they wouldn't have done it themselves so how it's it's tremendous pressure i think on them if they have to say yeah i guarantee that everything's right even if it's you know that i mean how could they know that they can't 

540.88 543.56 B: yeah i i'm glad i don't i mean 

543.84 548.59 B: a lot less people want to be ah i think want to be chief financial officers because 

547.97 549.05 A: mhm 

548.76 549.67 B: (( you know )) 

550.05 553.59 B: just because there's so much i mean there's a that sort of 

553.71 567.21 B: they're i guess ah i mean some people are worried about sort of maybe a progression over the past maybe you know what ten or twenty years of ah of imposing a lot more criminal liability on ah corporations 

567.33 580.55 B: and they're sort of the direction has you know has been towards making ah making a lot of things crimes that pr- that previously would of been you know you would of would of been subject to damages and civil fines 

580.61 594.73 B: but they're the penalties have gotten a lot harsher and ah there's a lot more criminal penalties for a lot of things that ah the corporate officers do now and and for people that are in and also you know each corporation has a board of directors also 

594.82 599.89 B: and ah and previously you know boards of directors they're they're supposed to
