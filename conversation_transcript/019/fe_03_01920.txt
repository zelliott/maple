103.50 104.80 A: mhm 

111.11 116.34 B: and um my father never wanted her outside of the home 

116.55 117.99 B: uh but when i

155.21 157.57 A: right [laughter] 

155.69 165.27 B: and after she started working and she said you're gonna have to help around here uh he became what i would call the casserole king for us being able to cook

165.47 171.79 B: uh and i've had uh good relationships uh with with um 

171.95 178.51 B: people that i would of married but i miss a lot of men who had been married once before 

178.48 185.20 B: [lipsmack] and they're a little gun shy going uh the second time cause we have had a lot of pressure 

180.62 181.62 A: yeah 

185.18 197.70 B: put on the family in the last uh few years i i'm with you i'm very pro family um i don't feel new york city is an environment where i'd lived 

192.40 193.43 A: (( [laughter] )) 

197.72 202.42 B: um that uh is family friendly 

202.13 203.25 A: right 

202.62 206.18 B: uh it doesn't make any difference if you're young 

206.48 220.65 B: or you're old there's certain things i wasn't aware of when i was younger that i am sensitive to now the schools are a disaster [sigh] and if you have kids you want 'em to be able to go to at least 

216.43 217.44 A: mhm 

220.50 224.06 B: why should you have to pay two times to go to school 

222.78 224.69 A: right absolutely 

224.14 227.95 B: uh public and private schools [sigh] and 

226.43 227.35 A: yeah in 

227.66 235.99 A: california it's strange because some of the schools are really good but then a few miles away you have schools which are horrible so it's all dependent on the neighbourhood you're in 

235.04 241.82 B: [mn] true that's very true i'm but i'm in a nice neighbourhood in manhattan 

241.14 244.12 A: (( is the schools bad )) 

243.85 248.85 B: the schools are um parent people who pay two times 

248.77 249.87 A: yeah 

249.14 251.61 B: it's okay for children 

250.57 252.86 A: oh right i see what you mean yeah 

252.32 259.18 B: into into middle school they're okay uh elementary 'til um 

259.89 263.29 B: about sixth grade it starts getting better at seventh 

263.00 264.38 A: mhm 

264.00 272.73 B: high school um i would not send my high school students to the public school in my neighbourhood 

272.13 273.34 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

272.97 280.03 B: um however if uh you know the ropes and your child can pass the tests 

280.24 293.29 B: they can get into some better schools but you can't be assured you are gonna to have a child that's gonna get into the better school and for a senior citizen it's not that friendly um like 

285.24 286.48 A: right 

291.46 292.61 A: mhm 

292.65 297.32 A: that surprises me i would think that there would be enough of the senior population that it would be 

293.76 296.55 B: [noise] 

296.95 302.53 B: uh there is is a strong senior population but they're not listened to [laughter] 

297.89 298.57 A: (( mhm )) 

302.54 310.63 B: and there are certain things that are hostile uh like i went out to brooklyn a couple weeks ago 

310.94 319.92 B: and uh because of the world trade centre disaster uh there's been a lot of in how to read the transportation maps 

319.53 320.62 A: (( right mhm )) 

320.00 330.27 B: uh the phone service so you can plan it in advance how to get i just wanted to go shopping in brooklyn [sigh] and just to get to brooklyn 

330.19 340.27 B: um i- i had difficulty on the transportation system but that wasn't the senior most unfriendly thing the most unfriendly thing is 

340.13 351.08 B: the subway stations didn't have elevators no it's okay for me but i thought you know what does a senior citizen do 

344.18 345.19 A: oh really 

351.06 356.24 B: and a lot of people like to come into manhattan the steps are too 

353.49 354.38 A: sure 

356.34 357.27 B: steep 

357.35 361.21 B: and that's true even in manhattan you have t- t- 

359.58 362.41 A: i would i would of thought ada would of 

362.55 365.31 A: really taken care of the american with disabilities and how 

364.83 371.30 B: oh they paid tonnes of money in buildings but if you're charging 

367.63 369.85 A: yeah yeah 

371.29 380.81 B: uh rent of two thousand a month that's not senior housing even though it's it's they they spent all of the money to make it capable 

376.06 377.30 A: (( right )) 

381.01 382.81 B: (( for disabilities )) 

382.84 389.98 B: and um it's it's it's a shame because the only people uh 

390.01 391.26 B: need 

391.59 397.13 B: there needs to be planning so that when they go out they know where they can go 

397.07 409.02 B: to use the the bus transportation works very well uh but the subways no so that's okay there is something there cause the buses lean down um 

400.75 401.94 A: mhm 

408.33 416.76 A: [lipsmack] at least at least you have public transport you should try this area [laughter] well we have it but it's it's pretty sparse pretty far between [noise] 

411.73 413.79 B: you don't have it [mn] oh 

415.47 417.41 B: okay the thing is 

417.36 431.98 B: [mn] women you know in families who wanna go shopping with their kids if you don't have elevators or escalators it's not a friendly environment to move around and do things with your family 

431.90 440.08 B: um one thing that i saw within the last week that i thought was so nice i went into a supermarket and there was a father 

440.43 447.54 B: and his son had a baby shopping carriage that the market provided 

446.67 448.50 A: yeah [laughter] 

447.53 451.18 B: and he had his own basket full of goods 

451.04 454.77 B: and he checked out independent of his father 

454.62 465.38 B: and he had to of been around seven or eight years old and i said to the i said to the dad and i said to the boy and said you have such a nice father 

457.15 459.51 A: that's great good training [laughter] 

465.22 471.05 B: i said when i grew up my father never went to the grocery store and did the shopping 

470.89 476.60 B: uh you're very lucky to have such a nice father and he just the father beamed and the 

475.95 478.56 A: (( [laughter] )) 

476.43 489.80 B: son beamed and it felt so good um to see that there are changes coming about but you need an environment that supports having families 

479.38 480.43 A: yep 

489.73 504.10 B: and uh it means that economically in tough times as well as better times that there's the support systems around and you came from a larger family so you should have that network 

499.36 500.56 A: right 

503.66 505.06 A: that's right [lipsmack] 

503.97 511.16 B: with my family kind of broke apart uh both my parents died relatively young 

511.06 523.26 B: my brother w- moved out to california and uh i'm in in new york and i have some friends here who believe it or not i still stay in touch with friends in california 

522.68 523.57 A: sure 

523.43 535.81 B: and one of the most uh the best things i heard was this friend in in uh the l._a. area who's a flight attendant [lipsmack] um she has this boyfriend who 

535.62 539.34 B: was the first to getting married if they can go in 

539.30 551.95 B: and didn't always want to do stuff uh because um he felt that he had done it all when he was married and i- i just spoke with her and i haven't talked to her in a long time 

545.07 546.57 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

551.82 559.35 B: i talked to her in the last couple of weeks and she said to me that her mum who is eighty said 

559.68 563.01 B: (( beverley when are you going to get married you know i'm )) 

561.43 562.81 A: [laughter] 

563.17 574.37 B: eighty right now and believe it or not she and her friend harry who'd known each other for years when he wouldn't budge they're now married 

574.20 575.54 A: oh that's great 

575.08 583.95 B: and they're building a home in santa barbara and they're happy and she'd seen so much more as he 

583.55 584.55 A: mhm 

584.05 589.18 B: and um and it's funny 'cause when he was single she used to complain 

588.84 589.86 A: mhm 

589.33 591.09 B: no complaints about him 

591.20 592.26 A: (( [laughter] )) 

591.28 593.09 B: you know which is nice 

592.78 599.89 A: yeah oh you know i it seems to me that a lot of second marriages actually work out pretty well because i think people know more about it 

593.40 594.27 B: umm
