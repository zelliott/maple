26.87 28.06 B: what about you 

28.46 34.90 A: um my family is in indiana i actually have some cousins in north carolina

104.12 105.07 A: uh-huh 

104.68 105.88 B: [laughter] um 

105.19 107.91 A: [laughter] what's your area 

107.44 109.55 B: uh i'm in linguistics 

108.97 112.58 A: oh really i'm a linguist [laughter] 

110.04 110.66 B: (( are )) 

111.11 112.13 B: (( you )) 

113.27 117.21 B: it doesn't surprise me because [laughter] those it's a harvard 

116.35 119.94 A: people interested in this kind of data collection 

117.58 118.77 B: yeah 

119.45 123.33 B: right harvard linguistics is doing this i think 

122.94 124.36 A: mhm 

125.38 126.42 B: um 

127.93 131.39 B: uh and what about you what does the word family mean to you 

132.01 133.16 A: well 

133.60 140.14 A: um they're people who even though they may not like you [laughter] can't get rid of you 

140.11 142.84 B: [laughter] yeah 

142.62 143.86 A: [laughter] 

144.43 152.21 A: and they share a history although it's been extended in a strange way recently like i have a 

152.18 162.33 A: twin brother who um just found out an ex girlfriend of his had a baby twenty five years ago that she [laughter] never mentioned to him [laughter] 

159.24 160.30 B: (( [mn] )) 

161.68 162.95 B: oh 

163.40 166.12 A: but it turns out to be his [laughter] 

165.00 166.67 B: oh you're kidding 

166.44 167.17 A: (( mm )) 

167.24 168.74 B: oh wow [laughter] 

168.06 173.87 A: [laughter] so i have a niece who is twenty five years old that i never heard about 

169.14 170.43 B: (( what a surprise )) 

173.33 175.32 B: oh my goodness 

175.57 176.84 B: wow 

175.95 187.83 A: so in in some sense that's family but somehow the the relationship of seeing somebody grow up and seeing somebody you know knowing somebody since you were little or seeing somebody since they were little is 

178.17 179.03 B: (( but it )) 

187.08 188.55 B: right 

187.86 191.85 A: more of the feeling of family to me than than some 

191.89 196.90 A: biological bond that you can only tell if you run some tests 

193.69 194.73 B: right 

196.88 197.88 B: right 

198.19 199.39 B: absolutely 

199.70 200.68 B: um 

200.72 201.62 B: my 

202.12 206.94 B: i mentioned i'm very close with my aunt and um she 

207.78 214.19 B: she divorced um the guy that i kind of think of as my uncle and uh remarried and 

213.51 214.53 A: mhm 

214.29 218.51 B: i cannot bring myself to call this man uncle dan 

218.13 219.22 A: mhm 

218.75 224.20 B: um he doesn't feel like family to me they've been married for maybe three or four years and 

220.93 222.00 A: mhm 

223.35 224.42 A: mhm 

224.26 225.30 B: um 

225.68 226.81 B: i think it maybe 

226.99 231.20 B: doesn't help the situation that he's kind of not a nice person 

230.88 234.26 A: oh yeah especially if you like the aunt that's got to be un- 

231.58 232.57 B: but 

233.04 237.79 B: yeah yeah i like the aunt a lot and um it's 

237.81 243.22 B: it's interesting i m- i don't know being southern you kind of grow up calling people 

243.23 245.23 B: aunt that aren't your aunt 

244.87 246.41 A: mhm 

245.55 246.51 B: um 

246.81 249.11 B: i remember my mom had a good friend 

249.28 250.16 B: that 

250.21 259.46 B: i was called aunt jackie that was not any relation to me just one of mom's friends that she wanted me to kind of show deference to 

255.90 256.79 A: mhm 

257.13 258.19 A: mhm 

259.90 264.17 B: so you stick an aunt in front of that [laughter] um 

261.96 263.16 A: mhm 

265.16 266.77 B: (( but i don't know if that would make )) 

265.55 275.50 A: yeah actually my the best friend of my graduate thesis adviser asked me to call him uncle doctor arthur [laughter] 

274.82 276.77 B: (( uncle doctor )) 

276.40 281.65 A: [laughter] that's arthur abramson i don't know if you did any phonetics but 

277.08 278.72 B: [laughter] 

280.93 285.35 B: um i did i although that name doesn't 

284.96 288.20 A: yeah they're the voice onset time guys 

285.62 286.18 B: (( oh )) 

287.43 288.79 B: okay 

288.80 290.10 B: okay yeah 

290.54 291.79 B: absolutely 

292.24 296.16 B: got ya uh what is your area in linguistics now 

295.58 309.34 A: um most phonetics after after after graduate school in linguistics i did a post stock in electrical engineering and m._i._t. and then ended up doing mostly speech recognition since then 

297.78 298.66 B: mhm 

304.97 306.14 B: (( oh wow )) 

308.88 310.22 B: oh cool 

310.62 311.90 B: very cool 

310.78 316.95 A: although now i'm um doing consulting and getting involved in um 

317.49 323.14 A: using speech technology and language education so that's a lot of fun 

321.56 322.77 B: oh 

323.26 325.23 B: that's very interesting 

325.89 327.47 B: um in 

328.54 330.84 B: e._s._l. or just in 

330.65 337.87 A: well more generally but a lot of the a lot of the um interest is in um e._s._l. and 

337.06 338.10 B: okay 

338.65 339.81 A: what about you 

340.87 344.51 B: (( i am studying reading acquisition )) 

344.19 349.32 A: oh really i'm really interested in that area too i'm also tutoring reading 

348.85 350.27 B: (( oh wow )) 

350.71 353.65 B: that's great i'm i'm trying to 

353.70 356.23 B: uh hopefully land a job with leapfrog 

356.04 357.01 A: uh-huh 

356.64 358.92 B: they're based out there in california 

358.30 366.66 A: that's right well one of the one of the company [laughter] i started a company that had a spin off company that does reading and 

359.20 360.85 B: (( nice area )) 

364.59 365.47 B: oh 

366.70 376.93 A: they had hired somebody who came from leapfrog and and i had done a project with the guys at broderbund who are now at um leapfrog so that sounds like a good company 

369.35 370.53 B: wonderful 

372.39 373.29 B: uh-huh 

375.02 376.26 B: oh neat 

376.86 380.26 B: neat so is all of that out there in california 

379.59 381.53 A: mhm mhm 

380.79 382.51 B: okay so that's kinda 

381.61 385.89 A: well actually the spinoff company the reading company is in boston 

385.54 387.60 B: okay what's the name of it 

387.00 391.92 A: it's called i named it sups but now it's called soliloquy learning 

391.97 393.80 B: soliloquy learning 

393.48 400.40 A: yeah and the idea is to use speech recognition to track as a child reads 

394.14 395.05 B: huh 

400.58 402.10 B: oh interesting 

403.35 404.63 B: interesting 

405.03 412.67 A: the project i'm now trying to get linguists interested in is um that you might be interested in is 

412.86 422.26 A: rewriting text to a lower reading level because in the kids i tutor once they get more than a year or two behind the real problem is that 

416.80 418.55 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

422.09 428.72 A: stuff they're interested in is too hard for them to read and stuff that's at their reading level is too babyish 

425.57 426.51 B: right 

428.25 429.43 B: right 

428.78 438.54 A: so if you could translate vocabulary and grammar um somehow make it more accessible there would be more text of interest to them 

433.11 434.18 B: mhm 

435.87 436.63 B: (( ha )) 

439.03 441.91 B: that's that's interesting i've um 

442.28 446.18 B: i think leap frog does something like that actually high interest low level 

445.62 459.56 A: mhm right introducing books high the high low series but i i think it's a technology not too much more difficult than things that people are doing automatically and i can't figure out why people aren't doing research in this area 

447.76 448.74 B: right 

449.78 450.61 B: okay 

457.10 457.83 B: mm 

459.25 460.19 B: huh 

459.60 462.32 A: for you know automating the process 

461.94 463.89 B: that's very interesting 

463.70 465.81 A: what's your thesis topic 

465.52 469.60 B: um onset rhyme awareness and reading acquisition 

468.90 469.96 A: mhm 

469.65 473.11 B: a balanced approach [laughter] 

470.94 472.62 A: [laughter] 

473.18 477.63 B: yeah i'm trying to finish it up um this month 

477.35 478.80 A: mhm 

477.98 484.47 B: but i'm i'm kind of at a standstill i haven't uh run any data yet so 

483.89 485.05 A: mhm 

486.63 487.91 B: um yeah we'll see 

487.62 494.07 A: yeah are you do you have to treat dyslexia and dealing with that or sort it out or 

493.62 504.31 B: um not not in my thesis um particularly although i'm interested in it um i'm looking i'm kind of replicating a study by rebecca trayman um 

498.70 499.71 A: mhm 

504.73 512.11 B: whether or not onset rhyme awareness is a strategy that kids can use when they're learning letter sounds 

511.48 512.53 A: mhm 

512.27 513.27 B: so 

513.53 521.28 B: letters um let's see letter sounds that occur in the onset of the letters name like the letter b. make a sound ba 

521.13 522.25 A: mhm 

521.37 526.70 B: and ba is the onset of its name those are much easier for kids to learn than when the um 

522.35 523.39 A: mhm 

527.64 530.05 B: letter sound comes 

530.50 538.03 B: say in the decode yeah like w. for sure or like even an l. where it's in the name of the 

530.69 533.29 A: like w. [laughter] 

535.02 536.00 A: mhm 

536.01 538.55 A: mhm mhm mhm 

538.11 542.71 B: decoder we've got w. and h. and y. those are really hard 

542.40 543.49 A: mhm 

542.82 543.78 B: um 

544.38 545.27 B: (( you know )) 

545.99 549.99 B: and then i'm trying to tie it in you know on a grander scale 

550.39 552.87 B: onset rhyme awareness and like 

552.97 554.11 B: there's 

554.16 568.00 B: a body of research out there using orthographic analogies that uh you can kind of get into that cycle of reading where you have to learn a segment but you don't get good at segmentation until you um 

568.52 573.97 B: have some experience reading and you don't get good at reading until you can segment and um 

574.46 576.04 B: you know kind of my 

576.09 580.28 B: proposition is that onset rhyme awareness is a way into that so yeah 

579.36 580.59 A: mhm 

582.82 586.27 A: well that's interesting are there any other linguists in your family 

586.26 589.62 B: no unfortunately um 

589.89 594.41 B: my uncle is a rhetorician in california um 

592.50 593.63 A: mhm 

594.61 596.57 B: maybe i could just go visit him 

596.90 599.89 B: uh yeah i suppose we need to go back to the family
