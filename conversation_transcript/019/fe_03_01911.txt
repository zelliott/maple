142.38 143.66 B: what were you saying 

144.06 147.42 A: you know i totally lost uh my train of thought there on that 

146.67 147.95 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

147.94 149.41 A: i totally forgot 

148.96 151.23 B: um your family's moving closer 

150.76 152.52 A: yes yes they are 

152.60 156.20 A: um hopefully in the next uh two or three months 

156.39 158.44 B: wow that's pretty soon 

158.00 162.77 A: yeah actually it is it it's been in the process for about a year now i think 

162.12 163.21 B: yeah 

162.78 163.71 A: so 

163.97 166.03 A: um 

164.04 166.95 B: is the reason they're moving to be closer to each other 

167.13 170.02 A: um yeah yeah um 

168.88 169.74 B: yeah 

170.94 175.61 A: my my uh [cough] excuse me my mother recently got married a few years ago 

175.59 176.63 B: mhm 

175.97 179.25 A: and uh my grandparents are getting older 

179.05 180.02 B: yeah 

179.40 181.94 A: and uh i guess they want to be together 

182.96 184.07 A: so 

183.18 184.40 B: yeah 

184.46 189.31 A: what about yourself did you grow up in uh a decent family so to speak 

188.94 190.20 B: um 

190.57 198.39 B: i have come to appreciate my family a lot more now that i'm older um i 

198.42 199.98 B: i guess uh 

200.15 209.81 B: i grew up with mom dad brother pretty standard but i moved out um when i was sixteen and lived with another family that i'm still closer 

209.68 210.58 A: okay 

210.19 216.61 B: and then when i kinda grew up a little um i moved back after high school 

216.82 224.69 B: as an adult and um we were able to kinda forge a relationship as adults and we work much better like that and 

224.07 225.62 A: well that's good 

225.24 228.25 B: so now they're a huge support for me and 

228.44 234.95 B: so i have a lot of family i have two large families plus i kind of consider 

235.07 237.55 B: the people that i've adopted into my life 

237.84 242.64 B: to be my family as well so lots of friends that i've had that i 

243.49 245.66 B: consider almost my blood 

245.51 246.84 A: mhm 

246.44 252.01 B: so i have a pretty loose definition of family actually [laughter] 

249.78 252.96 A: yeah i suppose well that's that's good though that's good 

252.24 255.30 B: yeah so that's i think why i like it so much 

254.88 256.42 A: do you think um 

256.79 260.44 A: middle class people have better families than uh 

261.04 262.37 A: substandard 

262.65 265.50 A: class people or uh really 

264.93 266.48 B: substandard [laughter] 

265.80 267.55 A: yeah well i'm you know 

267.16 268.98 B: right um 

268.36 270.59 A: the bottom of the bottom i guess 

270.01 273.08 B: yeah well i would say that um 

273.60 284.45 B: no i mean i think that economics don't have much to do with a family i think that if you're living in poverty you have a lot it's a lot harder you have a lot more stresses 

284.65 286.87 B: and so your family might get 

287.70 290.37 B: like tried more often 

290.19 291.07 A: mhm 

290.66 303.75 B: but i think also for some families um that's what brings them close together you know that sometimes when you're in a really difficult situation you have to kind of bond together with the people around you 

303.40 304.62 A: (( mhm mhm [noise] )) 

304.05 305.59 B: so i think that 

306.30 313.08 B: i don't know if i would i think that there's a lot of differences for people who live in different classes but i don't think 

313.20 316.01 B: it necessarily makes a better family or not 

315.92 318.89 A: okay well what do you think about the uh wealthy 

318.67 320.00 B: the wealthy 

319.40 321.36 A: and families yeah 

321.18 325.59 B: i i guess i would say the exact same thing you know i think that um 

325.77 335.84 B: money makes things logistically easier but it doesn't mean parents are going to be around it doesn't mean you're gonna spend time together it doesn't mean that you're not shipping kids out you know [laughter] 

330.65 331.54 A: mhm 

335.19 336.71 A: mhm 

336.04 341.34 B: to the with the nanny or whatever [laughter] so um i 

338.49 339.68 A: [laughter] 

340.46 341.50 A: okay 

341.58 343.41 B: (( don't know i think )) 

342.30 343.12 A: i 

343.65 345.04 B: so how about you 

344.52 349.22 A: i i i totally i would totally agree with you on that but um 

349.84 356.39 A: you know sometimes you know you just get a feeling you know middle class has you know the mother father brother sister 

356.50 357.61 B: yeah 

356.79 357.98 A: you know 

358.02 359.41 A: living in 

360.45 364.98 A: mid america so to speak you know a little bit better off than 

362.77 363.76 B: right 

365.18 370.14 A: the wealthy or the poor some you know sometimes i think 

367.93 368.97 B: yeah 

369.53 375.96 B: yeah i guess you know it's interesting say you know i think that in some cases it's really true 

376.09 386.54 B: i mean in other cases i think that one of the reasons we probably think that is we think of like america as like the we think of like middle class as like mainstream 

386.36 387.54 A: mhm 

386.85 395.80 B: you know and i just try i heard a statistic recently that um apparently only seven percent of the families 

395.85 404.38 B: are traditional families in the united states so meaning that only seven percent of all families are a mo- mother father 

399.06 399.94 A: really 

404.52 410.80 B: a married heterosexual um living together non divorced family 

407.00 407.78 A: mhm 

410.25 412.31 A: wow pretty low 

411.92 418.93 B: yeah it is pretty low [laughter] you know and that's kind of what we have our standard by pretty interesting 

418.79 424.46 A: i remember uh my grandparents talking um many times years ago about uh 

421.76 422.41 B: (( mm )) 

424.59 434.57 A: about back when they got married you know in the early fifties and uh how family was so important everyone lived within like two or three blocks of each other 

426.21 427.38 B: yeah 

431.04 432.03 B: mhm 

434.06 435.14 B: yeah 

434.90 440.53 A: and it it's funny how uh time goes by and that's not the same any more 

439.97 443.87 B: no it's really different i think and yeah 

442.03 442.85 A: different 

443.25 446.03 A: different values people have 

444.75 445.63 B: (( definitely )) 

446.27 448.88 B: i was um visiting my family 

448.92 450.95 B: um last week and 

451.32 466.28 B: we were talking about how even when i was growing up it was really important for us all to have dinner together you know and that it was like you couldn't miss dinner you know that you had to home whatever you were doing after school or after work or 

457.99 458.90 A: mhm 

466.31 474.09 B: and that was just the time that you spent together and now we weren't really a functional family [laughter] i moved out when i was sixteen but still you know 

474.09 482.67 B: there was still that time that we all had to spent together and that's just not even not even at all a reality now for most families yeah 

477.26 478.21 A: mhm 

482.04 485.27 A: mhm mhm well that's all very true 

485.72 490.30 A: i know a lot of people that uh you know have children and are not with uh 

490.42 492.50 A: the individual any more 

492.19 493.57 B: yeah 

492.99 495.59 A: and uh it it's just crazy 

496.34 498.67 A: you know i i can't picture that 

497.90 505.96 B: yeah yeah it it's kinda funny i um often get more surprised when my friends i'm sort of at the age where a lot of my friends are getting married and 

506.22 507.80 B: i i'm getting 

506.96 508.59 A: what age might that be

509.22 510.19 A: okay 

510.28 511.58 B: so i'm 

511.75 515.44 B: kinda more surprised that my friend are getting married than having children 

515.41 516.87 A: yeah yeah 

515.87 521.63 B: [laughter] you know i'm like oh you're getting married that's a huge commitment you're pregnant no problem you know and

520.89 521.87 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

521.93 523.39 B: it's very different

545.38 546.90 A: we'll say twenty 

546.72 547.81 B: right 

547.19 550.59 A: you know and that that's just crazy 

548.18 549.14 B: (( definitely )) 

550.54 557.06 B: it is i mean it's kind of i don't know what do you think about those new shows the married by america

558.44 560.91 B: (( uh terrible in my opinion )) 

559.76 560.92 A: [laughter] 

561.50 562.71 B: [laughter] 

561.50 562.52 A: um 

562.67 564.56 A: yeah i don't know i mean 

565.31 570.61 A: it's too hard of a topic i guess you know to really discuss 

569.03 569.90 B: (( what are you )) 

571.34 572.37 B: family 

571.74 573.49 A: yeah i mean 

573.50 575.62 A: i mean really what is a family though 

576.27 578.36 B: yeah what do you think a family is 

577.77 579.86 A: i i have no idea 

579.28 581.91 B: if you could define it right now what would you say it was 

581.72 582.89 A: um 

583.50 588.01 A: people being close to you that you care about and love 

588.34 591.51 A: would probably be family for me 

588.42 589.25 B: yeah 

591.14 593.21 B: i think that's a pretty good definition 

593.77 594.59 A: (( well )) 

593.81 598.53 B: i think yeah i think i kinda think of it as like people who are unconditional 

598.86 599.89 A: yeah 

598.99 599.95 B: (( they're unconditional ))
