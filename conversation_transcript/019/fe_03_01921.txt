58.50 59.36 A: (( um i )) 

60.26 64.33 A: guess family is sort of a support group in a lot of ways i think 

63.99 76.03 B: yeah see that's what i think too because i don't i don't have any family in chicago so i've definitely learned to like as far as my biological family [sigh] i have 

69.71 70.74 A: mhm 

76.10 80.69 B: limited contact with them 'cause they're in different states [sigh] so um 

80.74 91.00 B: i've definitely learned that family like you said is a support group or it is a different you know it's not necessarily meaning you are related to someone 

91.01 101.41 B: i think it can just mean people that you're comfortable you know around and people that you can lean on and share things with 

100.77 101.94 A: definitely 

102.36 108.79 B: you know and this might sound i don't mean to sound funny but like i consider my animals [sigh] my family too 

108.56 111.64 A: oh of course no me too [laughter] 

110.68 113.06 B: [noise] do you have a lot of animals out there or 

112.91 125.70 A: um i only i have a bird i have a parrot um and he's my only pet beside my roommate [sigh] uh has a bird and she has a bunch of fish [laughter] 

115.26 116.44 B: oh cool 

124.76 126.33 B: very cool 

125.99 130.52 A: and i definitely think that we treat them like [mn] spoilt children yeah 

129.85 137.96 B: like fam- yeah i actually work with animals so i'm like really a strong advocate of knowing a lot of people who consider their 

137.97 142.95 B: their pets um like family and my friend has a bird i don't know 

142.89 157.50 B: [noise] like hardly anything about birds but she loves hers i mean she is always talking about it and what she d- you know what the bird does and how it talks back to her and i know that she would be lost if any thing happened to the bird so 

158.51 160.73 A: wh- what kind of animals do you have 

160.46 168.66 B: i have um two cats [lipsmack] and then i have one fish and um even the fish i consider my family [laughter] 

167.30 169.60 A: [laughter] yes this is funny 

169.20 173.44 B: you know i feel guilty like if i forget him you know sometimes i'll forget him 

173.43 186.92 B: eh you know forget to feed him and then i'm like oh no i forgot to feed hulio and then i'm like oh no hulio here i am [sigh] and my cats are definitely because i live alone with them so they're definitely like my family 

187.30 192.41 B: you know and um i you know get 'em presents and you know 

193.04 199.63 B: i don't know i get really and i get really angry too this probably getting off the topic so sorry if someone's whoever 

198.83 201.62 A: (( [laughter] mm the topic )) 

201.01 208.90 B: but um yeah i get really mad when people don't treat their pets like family like and just abandon them when you know when they move or 

208.95 210.23 A: definitely 

209.03 211.19 B: y- you know if they 

211.23 222.20 B: get a new boyfriend who doesn't like cats or doesn't like dogs they just bring their animal to the shelter and you'd never do that with a person like i don't think many people are gonna bring their son or daughter 

221.86 222.86 A: [laughter] 

222.23 228.78 B: you know to a shelter because they meet a guy and they're allergic they think they are allergic to 'em 

229.02 229.96 B: you know 

230.11 236.18 A: i hate um you go pet stores and they have [sigh] those starter kits which are like 

236.32 238.14 A: the smallest little 

238.63 251.74 A: cages they're something for i guess frogs and lizards and things like that just with nothing and i i don't know people just i don't t- tend to think that people think that animals have um 

252.06 259.29 A: you know feel things as deeply as people but that doesn't i don't know that's definitely not the experience if you observe them 

259.09 268.89 B: i know like last last week it was really sad 'cause so many people were looking for rabbits for easter gifts and they don't you know that that is so so 

266.47 267.87 A: yeah 

268.91 277.27 B: wrong to get a rabbit for an easter gift you know i don't even know what rabbits have to do with easter any way you know we were trying to figure that out 

274.15 275.55 A: [laughter] 

276.92 283.18 A: yeah or chickens people get chicks and then they grow into chickens [laughter] [sigh] 

277.42 278.30 B: (( but )) 

279.41 280.37 B: yeah 

280.67 281.96 B: oh i know 

281.91 292.26 B: the saddest thing 'cause you know people think it's cute and you know it's i mean it's cute to look at but it's not cute for the animal when it's abandoned and 

292.15 299.29 B: you know it's like left somewhere and you know no are you in like a big city or like a smaller town or suburb or 

298.90 305.52 A: um it's a large city for for montana i think it's the third largest it's it's about 

306.28 317.19 A: we there's a university here i go to the university and um with the when all the college kids are in town um it's about eighty thousand sixty to eighty thousand people 

308.50 309.52 B: okay 

317.11 320.93 B: so so are most people there like in like um 

321.28 326.03 B: [lipsmack] how can i put it like in traditional families did you have every thing there as well like 

325.44 326.75 A: oh everything

330.94 333.18 A: large uh 

333.46 334.96 A: gay community 

334.63 338.02 B: oh really now see i wouldn't of even thought that 

337.82 344.25 A: [sigh] no yeah there are actually is um missoula's a pretty liberal uh town 

343.10 344.66 B: oh i've heard of missoula 

344.60 345.63 A: uh 

345.69 349.44 A: part i think partly because of the university and it's also um 

349.66 357.13 A: a writer's sort of colony there's a lot of writers who come out here we've got a good creative writing program and 

356.88 358.99 B: i had no idea 

358.46 367.72 A: just the mountains attract it so um yeah there's a lot of actually it's kind of interesting cause of the university [sigh] about a year ago um 

361.12 361.93 B: yes 

367.65 374.68 A: these two women two partners uh filed a complaint against the university saying that they should have equal um 

374.74 376.77 A: equal partner benefits 

376.94 390.50 A: um but they their partners should get insurance like uh heterosexual couple would get insurance and health care [sigh] and i think like a week or the few days after they um 

381.70 382.74 B: right 

390.57 394.17 A: they they filed the suit uh th- 

394.39 405.15 A: their house was burnt down with 'em in it they all got out they have a young child as well but it was a big hate crime out here and really pub- i mean they showed it around the country for a while [noise] 

397.77 399.55 B: (( oh my god )) 

403.50 416.50 B: [sigh] yeah i you know i vaguely remember like this is some sort of like i remember hearing a glimpse of this and that's awful cause i think that's definitely like falls into like a family as well do you know what i mean 

416.01 416.97 A: mhm 

416.54 421.17 B: it's like the traditional family of whatever a hundred years ago 

421.07 432.51 B: is not like the way every one lives these days you know and so i totally agree i think if people um i don't think people should have to be in a legal marriage 

424.98 426.08 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

432.53 443.63 B: you know i think there should be a way to clear your partnership or your family without having you know i don't know how you would do it but i just think that there should be some way to do it 

443.43 444.82 A: mhm 

443.85 457.65 B: um [lipsmack] so you can get those benefits without you know tax benefits insurance benefits things like that without having you know it doesn't mean the only family in the word is a straight man and a straight woman and two point five kids 

457.33 458.05 A: (( [laughter] )) 

457.78 469.04 B: you know see that's so interesting 'cause i i've travelled a lot but i've never been to the north west and all i really have heard about montana is that it's absolutely gorgeous 

468.95 482.40 B: and that also like um [lipsmack] you know there is some cowboy and western people and then also and i know this is so like stereotypical i so apologies and that like a lot of weirdo's go out there that want to be left alone

485.80 492.20 B: right and that's like i said i mean but i don't really believe in stereotypes do you know what where mean but that's 

490.81 504.00 A: mhm but they're sort of true i mean there are still not so much in western montana but um eastern montana's completely cowboys and you still you know they're all over town and [sigh] um 

503.55 506.26 B: now are you in eastern or western or central
