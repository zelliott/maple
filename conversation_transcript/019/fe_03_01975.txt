14.09 16.10 A: it doesn't matter to me [laughter] 

15.80 17.77 B: um i don't think 

17.97 26.91 B: that the government can really ever monitor all the things that somebody can do behind their closed boardroom door and um 

26.99 34.00 B: luckily a lot of the scandals have not affected me like thank god i haven't lost my life savings when enron 

34.10 34.98 A: right 

34.30 41.02 B: you know died or something but you know a lot of people have and it's terrible um do you have any thoughts on that 

40.82 48.38 A: yeah i you know i don't think you know i think there's a lot you know you can do so only do so much as far as reporting and there is just some 

48.40 49.89 A: people have to be 

49.91 54.82 A: honest and you know you can regulate try to regulate as much as possible but 

55.26 56.20 A: you know 

56.40 60.61 A: unless you are in a totally government run state 

60.95 61.99 B: (( right right )) 

61.30 68.43 A: there isn't really a lot that that can be done and corporate scandals haven't really affected us a whole lot either 

68.44 69.44 A: so 

69.17 71.32 B: (( okay yeah yeah it's )) 

71.50 82.02 B: until it starts getting like that book ninety eighty four and they have a camera in every single room everywhere um they can't possibly monitor all that stuff but the thing that's amazing in a way is 

76.14 77.07 A: right 

82.26 86.57 B: people can be so evil like like you hear about stuff where they'll 

86.52 101.30 B: just play fast and lose with people's life savings or their retirement plans or all those things and it's just for greed and it's like they just don't care they're so selfish and greedy that they can just you know destroy the rainforest or ruin people's lives or 

101.23 106.97 B: whatever or like that whole mike milkin thing or like how can people be that evil it's amazing 

103.87 104.75 A: mhm 

106.70 108.89 A: yeah and that they don't 

109.20 113.25 A: and it's always you know it seems like it's the people at the top [laughter] 

112.93 114.00 B: yeah that's 

114.09 115.50 A: that you know 

114.16 115.29 B: (( interesting yeah )) 

115.55 124.42 A: they have they're making plenty of money anyway and they're just you know i guess it's just kind of proof that you know there's never enough you never have enough 

124.65 130.48 B: yeah i guess like they're in some kind of weird psychological state where they i don't know i can't 

130.71 132.27 B: never having known 

132.30 141.23 B: you know bazillionaires corporate executives or anything i don't really know but they're i think they just can't be like regular people or something 

134.07 135.07 A: (( right )) 

141.05 150.64 A: yeah yeah you know they just can't be happy that you know i have enough money to buy what i need and just that doesn't seem to be enough for some 

149.20 150.27 B: yeah 

150.74 152.09 A: people but 

152.37 155.29 B: yeah it is very and i'm sure they have their whole 

155.33 160.83 B: own mindset about like probably in their mind they think wow this is great i'm doing the right thing or 

160.95 165.43 B: look how great it is what i'm doing or something like i i don't know if they 

165.46 178.78 B: really even feel that what they're doing is wrong or or anything kind of like you know drug dealers or people who are in a a drug culture where drugs are accepted and then they don't realize as much how awful it seems to people not in that culture 

169.20 169.97 A: yeah 

178.41 180.22 A: right yeah 

178.91 184.17 B: and maybe they're just all in their little world of you know high finance or something 

183.65 187.47 A: yeah and what looks looks good what you know 

185.71 186.94 B: right 

187.66 189.26 A: it looks good for 

189.92 194.25 A: for now and kind of live almost living for the minute instead of 

193.57 194.86 B: yeah 

194.29 196.03 A: on it really looking 

196.24 201.02 A: long term you know how this will all play out [laughter] 

197.41 198.51 B: (( right )) 

200.93 201.99 B: yeah 

201.34 202.32 A: but 

202.38 206.96 B: i don't know are we allowed to like do we have to stay on this topic 

207.13 207.87 A: i 

208.18 209.32 A: i don't know 

209.54 211.70 B: i don't know either like um 

212.59 216.31 B: i was you know when you read that little thing in the beginning of the study it say 

217.07 220.13 B: um like when people 

220.88 226.46 B: i don't and they ask you so many questions about the phone that i don't know if this study's about phones 

226.17 227.30 A: yeah 

226.70 234.29 B: or is it about people talking or what and they you know of course for the study they have to make it deliberately kind of ambiguous and 

234.48 239.67 B: 'cause if we knew what the study was it would affect us but really it's like you gotta wonder 

237.43 238.40 A: right 

239.54 242.56 A: yeah what yeah i'm not sure exactly what 

242.70 245.92 A: you know talking about trying to find information from 

246.22 247.67 A: from somebody 

247.67 248.67 B: yeah 

247.80 252.36 A: usually when you're talking you're usually trying to find out information from somebody 

251.91 258.04 B: right you're just like it's that the person's a stranger you're just like well what are the directions to independence hall or 

252.68 253.27 A: (( [laughter] )) 

257.63 258.72 A: right [laughter] 

258.39 264.90 B: you know do you know what time it is and so then they give us these these big meaty topics to talk about 

265.26 269.81 B: um oh okay yeah it says in your calls please speak on the suggested topic 

269.96 273.96 B: give your opinions and the benefit of your personal experience of which we have none 

274.00 279.33 B: and please ask about the other person's experience and opinions um yeah 

279.83 282.28 B: okay well 

280.56 281.23 A: (( [laughter] )) 

281.88 282.74 A: ah 

282.46 289.12 B: i mean it was a good choice of a topic you would think there would be so much to say about it but i kinda like 

289.41 292.29 B: it's just so remote from us well from me 

291.80 294.79 A: yeah yeah i don't i mean um 

296.21 310.23 A: my husband's an actuary so he works in insurance and i stay at home so so we don't have a lot of i mean we have retirement we're saving for but other than that we don't really have a lot of 

299.41 300.44 B: right 

301.67 302.82 B: right 

311.40 314.25 A: you know it doesn't affect us a lot [laughter] so 

312.20 313.20 B: right 

314.11 326.54 B: well the the scary thing is like sometimes it trickles down to just the regular people i think that that happened at enron and like a lot of these places just like the normal employees who had their retirement plan or whatever um that got affected 

326.31 327.69 A: yeah 

327.14 328.07 B: but 

327.62 342.45 A: i thought it was sad when i heard you know them talk about how every day when they were coming in to work people you know they were just really talking up enron and and encouraging people encouraging their employees to invest all of their money in enron 

340.13 341.84 B: yeah 

342.20 344.10 B: i know can you imagine 

343.84 347.50 A: and then you know then you know they're left high and dry 

347.20 348.41 B: right 

347.81 351.36 A: well you know while a lot of the executives sold 

351.84 353.39 A: they knew when to sell 

352.89 354.03 B: right 

353.94 356.77 A: and so they ended up being okay and 

357.77 359.38 B: yeah that's terrible 

359.02 365.62 A: and so you know i just thought i thought it was pretty sad you know it's one thing to be excited about your company and and 

366.04 377.03 A: you know wanting your employees to be happy with the company and and happy to work there but it's another thing just to be hyping it up so that they'll and buy your stock [laughter] 

369.25 370.29 B: right 

375.06 376.23 B: oh yeah 

376.32 389.88 B: right see that's it's just evil that's what i'm saying it's just like evil it's heartless and evil and then just think about the people who are kind of older like you know the younger people probably can pick pick pick up the pieces and move on but like the older people 

389.63 394.61 A: yeah the people that were you know five to ten years from retirement 

390.37 391.78 B: it's you know 

394.32 395.58 B: right 

394.97 396.56 A: that you know now 

397.25 401.70 A: you know they don't have twenty thirty years of working left 

401.42 402.49 B: right 

402.17 403.64 A: to make up for 

403.67 405.55 A: make up for that 

404.91 407.47 B: yeah yeah see well 

407.49 408.64 B: do um 

409.25 412.47 B: like does your husband work for a big corporation is it like 

412.16 413.54 A: mutual of omaha 

413.38 415.02 B: oh that's a big corporation 

415.01 420.20 A: so yeah it's you know it's pretty big but it's a little different in that i mean it's not 

415.51 416.44 B: yeah 

420.48 424.30 A: it's you know owned by the policy holders 

424.31 425.15 B: oh 

424.39 426.17 A: and so there really isn't 

426.33 430.40 A: stock per se to buy of the company 

427.45 428.74 B: interesting 

429.92 432.40 B: is that true of all insurance companies or is it 

431.77 434.20 A: most all mutuals 

434.45 436.84 B: wow so is that what mutual means 

435.80 436.37 A: (( yeah )) 

436.50 445.73 A: yeah yeah that's if a company if an insurance company is a mutual company then it's owned by all the policy holders 

437.05 438.10 B: oh 

438.67 439.62 B: so 

445.10 449.43 B: (( that's so interesting [laughter] i'm so glad i talked to you but )) 

447.73 456.55 A: [laughter] so yeah and i mean and it's kind of you know most most insurance companies are kinda set up that way but but um 

456.59 458.88 A: not not absolutely all of them but 

457.34 458.62 B: (( not all of them wow )) 

460.13 469.78 B: that's kinda nice that's like when united did that thing where the employees owned the company it's like all the stock somehow was turned over and all the employees owned it 

469.58 470.61 A: right 

470.32 472.65 B: i don't not sure how that works but 

471.73 474.90 A: yeah there's some some grocery stores around here like that 

474.71 475.87 B: (( oh yeah )) 

475.50 478.71 A: yeah that the it's employee owned or whatever so 

478.66 482.20 B: like what where are you are you in jersey of philadelphia or what

483.20 484.75 B: oh wow 

484.02 485.13 A: [laughter] 

485.27 496.87 B: oh 'cause um you know of course university of pennsylvania's right here in philadelphia and i am from philadelphia and i learned about it in an ad in the local paper but they're getting people from as far away as nebraska 

496.38 499.30 A: yeah i found it on the internet site actually 

498.90 500.65 B: wonderful 

500.14 501.51 A: so yeah [laughter] 

501.13 508.51 B: oh wow and um you really didn't have any kind of an accent that would make me think that you were not from around here or anything 

508.08 510.94 A: yeah well i don't know i think that's kind of 

511.34 512.53 A: nebraska 

512.66 526.57 A: there isn't a lot of a lot of accent around when you get further south kansas and south then there's more and more of an accent but i'm originally from kansas so i used to have the accent before we moved here 

512.70 513.67 B: okay

541.26 543.77 A: yeah well we're sorta 

541.60 542.80 B: do the topic 

543.59 546.09 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

544.45 545.60 A: [laughter] 

545.96 547.13 A: (( but ah )) 

547.03 548.07 B: um

556.04 563.01 A: yeah like five hundred you know five five different things and then i was like well i should of been writing that down but i wasn't [laughter] 

562.04 567.13 B: [laughter] um yeah 'cause i had the general idea and thought that okay so um 

567.40 570.42 B: scandals um 

570.80 575.41 A: oh and how it affected the economy and the stock market i guess was one 

574.36 580.64 B: oh okay yeah ironically like the stock market it's all made out of those people sort of and 

580.03 581.06 A: right 

580.92 583.20 B: so you hardly know what to think but 

583.35 585.27 B: the stock market is so 

585.67 594.02 B: i mean this is going so dumb to say it's obviously unpredictable it's like normally a war makes the stock market better but this made it worse 

589.39 590.32 A: right 

593.65 594.72 A: yeah i 

594.92 599.89 A: i don't know if it really i think it affected the stocks some because you know they just
