56.38 60.03 A: oh my goodness [laughter] so 

57.10 60.67 B: yeah i've had her for almost twelve years so 

60.18 65.37 A: that's like another daughter or something then [laughter] 

61.48 65.45 B: yes it is it's yeah so how about you 

65.56 66.60 A: um 

66.65 68.70 A: i'm thirty one 

68.34 69.28 B: uh-huh 

68.75 77.21 A: and my parents are about your age you know a little bit older but they started young too [laughter] but yeah i have two daughters and um 

72.35 73.38 B: uh-huh 

77.54 82.00 A: one's in preschool they're five and six and one's in kindergarten so 

80.08 80.85 B: oh 

81.79 83.00 B: neat 

82.01 94.72 A: i'll be pretty young when mine grow up and move out too [laughter] what family means to me let's see my family's all really close we all live in the same state 

84.79 87.39 B: yeah [laughter] 

94.24 95.48 B: oh 

95.02 96.02 A: so 

96.12 110.99 A: it you know i see them frequently and um i grew up with also kind of an extended family friends of the family that we always called grandma and aunt and uncle so to me family means you know anybody that's there for all the important times in your life 

98.72 99.76 B: mhm 

110.96 117.22 A: and anybody that whenever you have a problem you can call them up and they'll help you and they're not going to be judgmental 

116.78 117.83 B: right 

117.35 129.53 A: so technically i could say a few of my family members are less like family and more like acquaintances [laughter] there always are i think [laughter] so yeah that's what i consider family 

122.62 126.20 B: right well we all have those don't we [laughter] 

129.54 143.05 A: and i feel really blessed to just have as many people around as i do and since everybody did start young my children have met their grandparents great grandparents and know them well and we just started to lose some of them recently but 

143.35 152.17 A: you know we've been really blessed to have a very big family and and to meet everybody you know i remember my great grandparents so that's a good thing about starting young right 

151.81 153.30 B: yes it is 

152.23 157.37 A: you get to know all your grandchildren [laughter] before you pass away [laughter] 

153.94 155.24 B: (( yeah )) 

155.89 158.55 B: well it sounds like you don't have um 

158.81 164.40 B: like you have a very connected family like not many divorces or 

163.56 178.42 A: we have no divorces anywhere in our family oh my gosh i can't even imagine that we don't i didn't even think about that my parents aren't divorced none of my grandparents are divorced none of my aunts and uncles have ever been divorced oh my gosh 

166.13 167.43 B: see i think 

176.67 184.83 B: mhm see that makes a big difference because divorce just really splits a family just splinters it off you know 

179.67 181.12 A: yeah 

183.95 187.03 A: i think it has to i mean i don't know how it couldn't 

186.43 188.43 B: right and then it 

187.38 194.17 A: unless you just happen to be in one of those situations where the people are just get along so sickeningly well but [laughter] 

191.37 198.68 B: right yeah and then you know there's like stepparents and then there's more family and then 

196.14 197.51 A: (( yeah it's hard )) 

198.54 201.93 A: is that your family [laughter] 

199.59 209.89 B: oh my gosh you know i mean it's it's like the story of of generations you know my my grandmother on my mother's side was married seven times 

205.37 206.55 A: yeah 

209.22 210.50 A: oh my gosh 

210.15 216.00 B: and my mother is on her fourth marriage fourth of fifth [laughter] i don't know 

214.33 221.96 A: oh my gosh so what does family mean to you then as far as the step family goes is that just anybody who marries into the family or [laughter] 

220.41 223.78 B: you know that's just it you never really connect 

223.85 232.40 B: you know um i have i'm the oldest and i have three brothers um and my and my youngest brother is actually a half brother 

224.11 225.70 A: oh 

228.64 229.59 A: okay 

232.21 233.11 A: okay 

232.70 238.33 B: but um i mean i was there when i was eleven when he was born so i you know he's like my brother 

236.34 239.26 A: you watched him grow up yeah 

238.65 239.77 B: (( then um )) 

239.96 248.21 B: my brothers and i are close we all live in different places i have one brother here in the same town with me everybody else is scattered 

248.04 249.51 A: that's hard 

248.89 261.26 B: yeah it is really hard and so it's hard just to stay in touch um then you know there's all those little family things that happen you know there's the divorce and then there's remarriage and 

257.63 259.53 A: there's the divorce and 

260.71 263.99 A: everybody takes their sides and right 

262.27 275.51 B: exactly and then and then somebody has a baby and you don't find out about it for a while because everybody's mad you know what i'm saying it's just really it's hard it's disconnected because i because all it takes is that first divorce 

267.77 270.07 A: (( oh my god yeah )) 

275.32 276.29 A: right 

275.47 278.91 B: and and then things just start going really awry 

278.33 283.46 A: you said your mom's married five times four times that would be really hard in itself 

280.25 281.27 B: uh-huh 

282.85 285.33 B: yeah it is and because 

283.98 289.02 A: to try to have a man walk into the house and take over as a role model over and over again 

287.07 288.00 B: right 

288.62 296.99 B: exactly yeah it is it's tough so for me my family is um immediate 

289.60 290.85 A: yeah 

297.08 302.89 A: right who's living in the house or who's just moved out [laughter] 

297.38 298.96 B: (( it's what's immediately )) 

300.67 309.85 B: right you know um my husband and i have been married for seven years and and he's um sixteen years younger than i 

309.29 310.60 A: (( wow )) 

309.97 314.57 B: yeah he he never was married he's never been married so he doesn't have any children so 

313.99 319.63 A: he must be a responsible man then [laughter] he's that much younger than you and he's got it together 

316.06 321.66 B: yeah [laughter] he he's learned he's [laughter] he's 

320.19 333.39 A: i think my husband's just about figured it out now i mean we've been together for ten years but well married for ten years together for sixteen we've been together since i was fourteen but it's like he's finally growing up now that he's in his thirties [laughter] 

321.91 323.49 B: [laughter] 

324.28 325.75 B: oh 

327.10 328.18 B: uh-huh 

331.31 336.39 B: right well this one had to learn real quick because i had the granddaughter 

335.84 337.13 A: well there you go 

336.48 339.21 B: you know and she was only four when we met 

338.11 342.11 A: oh my god that's a hard time that's a very hard time 

339.45 341.13 B: yeah and he had 

341.99 345.45 B: never been around children you know he had never had any 

344.76 345.92 A: (( oh my )) 

345.53 355.74 B: but um so what i have built here with my husband and my granddaughter and now the mother you know my daughter of this of the grandchild that i'm raising

359.61 360.83 A: oh 

361.04 374.20 B: um it was it was like a drug thing you know and all that and now she's got now she's gotten herself straightened out and lived here for a year and she's gotten her first job and she's i'm trying to connect those two my granddaughter and her back again 

361.37 362.89 A: that's hard yeah 

364.27 365.42 A: oh yeah 

373.12 378.78 A: that's so great and she's probably old enough to accept start accepting that now probably too 

374.21 375.39 B: you know so 

378.03 385.64 B: a little there's still a lot of resentment you know it's like why didn't you want me when you were young why why did grandma raise me and you didn't you know 

384.52 388.59 A: because honey you'd probably be a mess [laughter] that's 

386.45 393.05 B: that's right or you wouldn't even be part of this family you know she could of ended up in the system heaven forbid 

389.36 390.46 A: right 

392.83 405.06 A: oh my mom works with kids that are in the system she's a behavior classroom teacher and you know it's just terrible you know kids of druggie parents who don't have grandparents that will accept them and take them in it's just a mess

395.69 396.83 B: yeah 

397.51 398.66 B: uh-huh 

402.89 404.20 B: right 

404.55 415.18 B: well i was just i've been reading a lot on the subject and there are over thirty thousand grandparents across the united states that are raising grandchildren because what's the alternative 

409.55 410.75 A: oh yeah 

411.68 412.63 A: oh yeah 

413.42 414.54 A: right 

415.19 423.34 A: the alternative is to never see your grandchild again which unfortunately some people don't care you know they just say i don't care 

420.66 422.78 B: i know i know 

423.32 433.09 B: and see that's part of me going now wait a minute i know that there should be a core family and this baby belongs in my family and that's where that baby's gonna stay you know
