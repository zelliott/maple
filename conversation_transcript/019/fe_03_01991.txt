132.97 143.41 B: um we get three but i think you can sign up to do more a couple of people they're letting do more and then you can always call into the system too i think 

139.35 140.47 A: right 

143.08 155.20 A: well i had uh i've been having trouble with my phone number i don't know if it was because i was using the zapper on my line but i was not receiving any phone calls so then they gave me a email telling me i could initiate phone calls 

154.90 155.56 B: yeah 

155.36 164.94 A: so that's what i've been trying to do lately and this is the first time that it's worked for me [laughter] i did talk to a lady ah a month ago and she was in new york 

159.57 160.79 B: [laughter] 

165.26 170.75 A: [mn] we had a interesting conversation because [cough] she had family overseas 

170.62 171.92 B: oh 

171.31 175.22 A: and you know she was having mixed feelings about the war and everything because 

175.36 177.67 A: she had loved ones she cared about too 

178.04 179.05 B: yeah 

179.21 180.94 A: (( but i tell y- huh )) 

179.30 180.33 B: this past 

180.55 181.40 B: pardon 

181.31 183.11 A: (( [mn] go right ahead i didn't mean to )) 

182.19 190.06 B: oh i said this past month i have a lot of friends in the army and the marines so i was calling their families to see if they'd been deployed or not 

189.67 194.46 A: interrupt my ah son in law's in the marines he just got back from over there 

193.89 194.55 B: (( oh )) 

194.95 198.69 A: so yeah it it means a lot to me too to keep up with this 

199.86 210.83 A: and especially on i don't know if you watch fox news network but it was so comforting to you know to have the reporters right there with all the military guys letting us know what they were doing 

211.00 219.08 A: and they got you know to talk to the family back them and it kind of gave me a bond with them like you know they weren't so far away 

220.81 225.49 B: yeah i try not to watch the news too much 'cause it's depressing [laughter] 

224.61 231.76 A: [laughter] it can be i just you know i think that ah i'm just so relieved that the hopefully the worst part's over with 

231.42 232.40 B: yeah 

232.48 233.57 A: (( but you )) 

233.69 235.48 A: just never know [laughter] 

237.49 239.05 B: the news has kind of like 

239.12 248.67 B: kind of dropped their coverage of it they've kind of said you know the war is basically over we're going to be occupying and there isn't as much coverage as there was even two weeks ago 

248.90 262.14 A: well i just think that ah i think that sometimes we had too much focus on our men because we were telling everywhere they were and if they were trying to sneak up on someone they had no way of doing it 

255.08 256.16 B: yeah 

261.53 262.59 B: right 

262.18 263.48 A: [laughter] 

262.70 264.88 B: i totally agree with that [laughter] [mn] 

264.14 275.94 A: right it was just something that it was interesting though to get to to see it first hand for a while but now when you turn to the news it just seems like it's so boring because [laughter] it's back to the regular things 

277.93 282.67 A: and i miss some of it i guess 'cause it kept me company during the night i was you know watching 

284.09 290.95 A: but i'm just glad that i saw two of ships come home home today and it's just so wonderful to see the families reunite 

293.03 293.81 A: (( [cough] ))

300.66 303.35 A: (( i have [mn] to keep clearing my throat )) 

304.83 306.04 B: no problem 

305.72 306.37 A: (( [laughter] )) 

307.14 311.14 A: [cough] so do you have anyone close in your family that's in the military

350.07 352.65 A: oh it's still hard isn't

352.77 353.60 A: (( it )) 

354.58 359.77 A: right i can't believe that there are still pe- people out there because you know we're sending so many home now 

359.77 366.95 B: yeah yeah well one of our other neighbors ah was going to be sent to afghanistan and they changed it to france

380.20 383.32 B: we're we're glad they changed his posting though uh 

383.69 390.46 A: i know they're trying to find you know all those hidden documents and things and that's going to put our men in jeopardy too because 

390.49 403.25 A: they want us out now they say okay w- we've won you all get out united states and we can't do that we got to hand it over to somebody responsible and and that's going to be hard trying to decide who's going to you know rule the country now 

403.15 404.20 B: yeah 

404.75 410.61 A: 'cause they think already think the united states is really aggressive so we really need to kind of tiptoe around them [laughter] 

411.70 413.98 A: and get out and get our guys back home 

413.92 415.21 B: (( yeah yeah ))
