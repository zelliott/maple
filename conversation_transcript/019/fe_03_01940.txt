74.40 76.42 B: oh you have an extended family 

76.20 82.06 A: yeah and then my mother i always tell people about her because she's from a family of fourteen children 

81.62 83.04 B: oh my gosh 

82.57 87.76 A: so i mean that's really a huge family i can't imagine what that was like but i hear the stories 

84.54 86.21 B: [laughter] 

87.89 96.90 A: you know from her sisters and them talking about what the days were like back then and they lived in a four bedroom house and

97.63 101.63 B: fourteen children and two p- sixteen people total

104.25 106.12 B: oh my gosh mhm 

105.16 119.21 A: but what family means to me is i think about her family and you know they have a lot of um get togethers every every year they have a standing thing for thanksgiving where they hold it in a church basement because there's so many people 

118.59 119.98 B: oh my gosh 

119.57 125.84 A: so there's usually you know it probably varies from one hundred and fifty to two hundred you know on a good year but 

125.09 126.83 B: [laughter] 

126.65 127.83 A: [laughter] 'cause 

126.91 128.37 B: that's amazing 

127.89 134.42 A: all the nieces and nephews well th- they can come come in if they can't come they don't feel bad and they'll try to come the next year 

132.58 133.35 B: (( ahah )) 

134.09 137.00 B: because i guess you get lost in the maze of of 

136.39 137.59 A: yeah 

137.01 138.42 B: so many people 

138.32 139.47 A: yeah 

139.03 140.15 B: wow 

139.61 151.78 A: and there's varying degrees with those people in the family i mean there's some that don't come have never come because they live well they use that for an excuse they live out of state or even when they live closer they didn't come they just don't care about it you know 

144.51 145.49 B: (( mhm )) 

150.99 151.79 B: right 

151.78 155.22 A: and then there's certain ones that are diehards and they love it but 

154.54 155.59 B: (( mhm )) 

155.67 164.81 A: and my daughter being an only child because i didn't get married until she was actually in her teens i think she feels kind of cheated sometimes you know because she was the only child 

159.62 160.27 B: (( mhm )) 

165.23 171.01 A: and like where's the rest of my family you know [laughter] maybe you know what i mean when i say that [noise] [noise] 

166.89 169.05 B: mhm right [laughter] 

170.13 182.26 B: [laughter] i do i do it's it's so interesting because now that i'm i'm married my husband um he has a kind of a typical family like a mother and a father and brother and 

182.28 193.10 B: aunts and uncles and nieces and nephews and all these people so this past year was the first time that i've actually been to a thanksgiving dinner or a christmas dinner with 

193.11 195.13 B: a bunch of people who were related 

194.99 196.22 A: yeah 

195.59 200.14 B: so it was so change for me i was like oh my gosh this is great [laughter] like 

199.57 200.62 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

200.46 206.42 B: you know just really amazing and so someone just recently it's my birthday today actually 

206.06 208.14 A: oh happy birthday [laughter] 

206.91 214.12 B: thank you and i got a card in the mail that said you know happy birthday to my niece and i was like whose niece am i 

213.24 214.73 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

214.28 222.88 B: but i was like oh my gosh it's great now i have like a big normal family because all my mother's relatives passed away so ahah 

218.98 220.08 A: yeah 

222.20 225.61 A: i think it can be real comforting especially when there's times when 

225.84 229.72 A: um like right now i'm helping out a lady who has cancer 

230.01 242.62 A: and she really has been very independent she's in her seventies but hasn't really had to rely much on anybody for any help and all of a sudden she needs a lot of help because she's you know getting chemo and 

236.65 237.52 B: (( right mhm [noise] )) 

242.69 252.47 A: she just needs somebody there and i thought this is when the times when family and friends are really important you know you hate to say that but you you need it you have need 

251.08 252.50 B: yeah it's true 

252.91 257.74 B: and she doesn't have family or friends in the area obviously you're helping her out a lot okay [noise] 

256.91 270.12 A: well she has a son that lives um you know within ten miles but another son that lives in another state so it makes it really hard i mean our society now is people live all over and people lose track of their 

270.24 272.35 A: family ties and 

272.63 278.10 A: it's really i think it's difficult you know cause you have to go where you can for a job and [noise] [noise] [noise] 

277.26 278.18 B: yeah 

278.37 285.63 B: yeah it's it's kinda of interesting people used to stay in the same areas as their family all it the time kinda year after year and year 

285.72 288.18 B: (( and so um you know my )) 

288.47 301.84 B: my new family you know they all live in pennsylvania area and one after i started you know dating him got married i realized i wanted to be closer interstate where all these new people who were my new family were 

301.47 304.11 A: yeah you wouldn't want to be away from them [lipsmack] 

303.48 309.21 B: yeah so we picked up everything and left our jobs in new york and moved back to pennsylvania 

308.89 310.25 A: oh wow 

309.79 315.72 B: so it's been great though [noise] it's definitely been great you know it's a new experience for me 

315.90 327.01 B: um but it's definitely been worth it you know i'm glad that i get a chance to have like kinda of a pseudo grandmother now and uncles and aunts which is really kinda neat 

318.75 319.65 A: yeah 

323.85 324.90 A: yeah 

327.75 329.65 B: so i love it [laughter] 

329.23 334.76 A: well that's that's good because then you've got your um what do they call it when you have your network 

329.98 330.54 B: (( [mn] )) 

334.93 340.55 A: you know there's your um support group or whatever you want to call it and then there might be times when you say 

337.80 338.97 B: yeah 

340.66 347.44 A: oh i well i live i grew up in a small town and it seemed like my relatives were always around keeping an eye on everything i did 

346.80 350.96 B: yeah [laughter] [laughter] the good things and the and the bad things 

348.43 356.35 A: [laughter] growing up yeah and if it wasn't a relative somebody knew you know my family or knew my relatives so 

354.43 355.32 B: (( right ))

364.56 367.98 A: i grew up in a little town of fairbolt minnesota 

366.93 368.95 B: (( fairbolt which part of minnesota okay )) 

369.01 375.47 A: um it was about an hour south of the twin cities so about an hour north of the idaho border 

375.27 378.73 B: i use i used to travel a lot to minnesota for work 

378.46 379.61 A: oh really 

379.02 380.84 B: so i love it out there 

380.32 382.19 A: was towns did you travel in 

381.61 388.39 B: um the twin cities mostly back and forth there but there was a small town in southern minnesota 

384.02 384.94 A: okay 

388.57 390.65 B: oh my gosh i'm trying to remember the name 

389.94 391.44 A: (( ohatana ))

391.55 392.98 A: (( ohatana )) 

392.77 397.52 B: no it's really tiny back when i used go there and this was in the 

397.84 401.53 B: late eighties the telephone numbers were two numbers though 

401.82 404.04 A: oh wow [laughter] 

402.50 403.35 B: um 

403.77 416.38 B: and i oh the high schools' colors were purple and white and it was and i can't remember but it was just like a small kind of farming community and there is a lake there and everyone knew each other there was as general store so 

413.35 414.22 A: mhm 

416.63 421.54 B: i have always you know looked back on those times like really fondly because everyone knew each other you know 

420.89 424.36 A: yeah my town was bigger than that it was sixteen thousand so 

423.76 424.80 B: (( oh okay )) 

424.71 428.36 A: so it had but i know what the little towns are like i think 

424.90 425.95 B: [laughter] 

428.42 431.67 A: you know sometimes growing up in those kind of towns 

431.75 434.56 A: the family really sticks around 

433.94 435.04 B: yeah 

434.98 448.26 A: especially if there's enough enough um farm or whatever their kids are gonna to do to keep em busy but a lot of times you know like if there is more than one son or daughter there's not enough to make a living off of one farm so 

447.50 455.98 B: right right and it seems like a lot of people you know stuck around if they did go to college you know at the university of minnesota they would come back 

456.06 460.54 B: and work in the town or work on the farm so it was a kind of a nice atmosphere 

460.27 461.35 A: yeah 

460.70 461.80 B: (( and um )) 

461.68 465.56 B: the family that i would go out there with one of my friends from high school 

465.35 477.21 B: you know everyone knew that you know this family would come in during the summers so it was kind of nice like everyone would get together and you know have picnics and things like which was great but i love minnesota 

475.12 476.08 A: yeah 

476.50 479.06 A: [lipsmack] but talking about families again 

479.16 486.16 A: i feel sometimes like well that huge family is my mother's family you know it's it's not really my family 

483.17 483.84 B: (( ahah )) 

485.59 486.52 B: (( really )) 

486.33 488.27 A: well because it's 

488.51 493.28 A: i mean my family should be my mum and dad and my brothers and sister 

492.89 493.95 B: (( right )) 

493.36 494.55 A: you know but 

494.77 499.62 A: none of my brothers or sisters like to come to that big family get together 

499.02 500.17 B: oh really 

499.86 502.39 A: no they just don't feel comfortable there 

502.56 503.25 B: (( wow mhm )) 

502.67 514.78 A: but and i'm the only one that really goes you know and i don't go every year either but my daughter and i we kinda get a kick out of it we think it's neat that it's a tradition that just keeps going and 

507.65 508.57 B: right 

514.83 520.68 A: you know we we feel like well if we're around then we'll go to it but if like say she lives in atlanta

520.27 521.82 B: oh wow [noise] 

521.09 526.56 A: so if i want to be visiting in atlanta then i don't feel bad if i miss the thanksgiving

542.10 545.17 A: [laughter] she travels every week for her job and 

545.36 551.85 A: and and i mean i guess when i was younger i thought oh it would be great if my daughter grows up to be a career women 

545.56 546.28 B: (( [noise] )) 

551.45 552.20 B: (( ahah ))

556.25 562.02 B: right [laughter] and that that's kind of the nice thing that i discovered when i kind of you know 

562.19 571.34 B: changed everything in my life now i have a lot more time to focus on family before when i was so involved with my career you know i never took vacations now i feel like
