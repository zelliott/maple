11.27 12.97 A: hi this is krystal 

13.20 14.38 B: okay 

15.78 24.08 A: and i'm not exactly sure what i'm supposed to be talking about but um i guess it's about um what the government can do to prevent um 

24.53 25.83 A: what is it again 

26.64 32.98 B: oh how the scandals has affected the economy and how we feel about it and this that and the other 

33.19 34.29 A: (( oh okay )) 

34.42 39.99 A: well i guess you could go ahead and start if you wanted i'm not too familiar with that topic 

40.30 45.33 B: you're not familiar with all the scandals that going on with the companies out there like enron and 

44.93 48.73 A: oh okay yes i've heard about enron so oh 

49.01 51.69 B: yeah they they want your feedback on that 

51.30 52.29 A: okay 

53.05 59.81 B: you know has it do do you trust the government do you think they should be more involved in it do you um 

60.55 66.14 B: do you feel like they're doing enough to to keep this stuff from happening again 

67.87 69.31 A: oh um 

70.10 80.23 A: yeah the government should probably be in it a little bit but not too much or it becomes more um government controlled for independent businesses 

80.52 81.59 A: um 

82.42 85.23 A: boy i'm not quite sure 

85.32 87.83 A: how much they should be involved in 

87.40 88.35 B: right 

88.91 89.86 B: um 

90.12 91.32 B: (( you know it's )) 

91.73 92.51 B: (( ah )) 

92.80 95.30 B: (( so many probably step in because )) 

95.75 96.74 B: the um 

97.58 103.63 B: you know a lot of companies would go under and lose a lot of bus- a lot of jobs people's gonna lose jobs and then 

103.78 114.94 B: that will bring the unemployment down you know the the unemployment rate's gonna go back up and you know and then it's like okay you gonna have that problem 

115.23 117.64 B: and then you're gonna have you know the um 

118.45 124.08 B: these companies that you know continually just put bad numbers on the books that's um 

124.53 131.29 B: it's like every day every day you pick up the paper or on the news you hear another company's where the accounting 

131.65 135.18 B: department of the firm has done something wrong 

135.50 136.88 B: and it's just like 

137.71 141.94 B: maybe they should have stricter guidelines or something 

142.05 145.94 A: oh i agree i think that they should um become a little more hard 

145.95 150.57 A: um especially with the consequences of those companies that are doing those things 

150.70 151.82 A: um 

152.33 154.23 A: i'm not sure how much um 

154.57 159.32 A: controlling they should do but they should make it ah a lot more strict um i 

162.73 164.37 B: (( yeah maybe they um )) 

164.87 166.38 B: (( i don't know if they um )) 

166.63 171.31 B: you know i agree with you i don't know how much they can actually go into a business and say hey listen 

173.10 181.87 B: you can't do this you can't do that and you know it i mean pretty soon i guess if the government has too much control over them they'll be running the business 

181.33 183.04 A: (( don't know right exactly )) 

183.06 184.56 A: yeah that's for sure 

183.41 190.42 B: and then and then the companies wouldn't be owned by themselves they would be run and owned by the government 

189.83 193.08 A: right it would be government controlled so 

191.29 192.43 B: exactly 

193.14 199.86 A: and that's it's a kind of a tight line between government controlled and um and independent business 

197.26 198.44 B: mhm 

199.53 200.68 B: right 

201.20 202.54 B: so um 

204.28 205.97 B: i don't know what we're gonna do 

207.10 210.40 B: you know it's a it's a tough call here so ah 

211.27 219.19 A: right i don't know how much the government can actually get in there i mean with any you know any business i mean especially with you know enron is a 

219.50 220.72 B: yeah 

219.71 222.08 A: was a huge corporation but 

221.00 226.39 B: oh yeah well and then you have health south now that's being investigated 

226.16 227.55 A: pardon what was that again 

226.97 228.61 B: health south 

228.58 229.41 A: oh 

229.64 231.48 A: i'm not familiar with that one 

231.69 232.88 A: what was that one 

232.40 233.51 B: um 

233.76 236.36 B: it's a big health care um 

236.51 242.71 B: they're based out of um i think down in alabama or somewhere um 

243.44 251.98 B: where they also had big accounting where the president or the c._e._o. or somebody i forget now um just did the numbers wrong 

252.45 257.97 B: well he knew about it and um you know he still got his big pay out bonuses 

258.20 261.68 B: and and all this kind of stuff and ah 

262.92 267.24 B: while his company's going down he's living the good life 

267.65 268.61 A: (( oh wow oh )) 

268.55 269.35 B: so 

268.72 269.52 A: (( yeah )) 

269.59 282.87 A: it's really um sad for the employer employees who have nothing to do with the actual you know c._e._o. and you know the managers of the company it's kind of sad when they lose their job over it you know when the top um 

272.03 272.95 B: mhm 

277.16 277.99 B: well 

280.39 281.39 B: yeah 

282.84 288.77 A: you know managers are are the ones who are involved [laughter] in this you know downfall of these companies 

287.23 295.12 B: well i mean they're the ones who make the big dollars they've invested their money so even if they lose their jobs they've still got money to 

294.41 295.46 A: right 

295.15 303.90 B: to to live on where the you know the the other people they don't make that kind of money they're probably just making just 

304.84 308.95 B: you know they probably have to have a two income family where um 

307.61 308.81 A: exactly 

309.48 320.96 A: it's tough for them because then especially in this economy that we have right now it's really tough you know for them to even find a job after something like this happens like at enron or you know any of these other companies 

312.16 313.25 B: mhm 

318.88 320.16 B: well any of them 

320.23 322.14 B: that's right so um 

322.74 324.95 B: (( so i don't know we )) 

326.32 331.20 B: something has to be done not quite sure yet what what it's gonna be but um 

332.12 345.65 A: yeah i guess maybe the government should just you know make tough really tough consequences for these companies that do these things and then maybe the other companies will decide that maybe they don't [laughter] they don't want to do the same thing 

345.50 347.91 B: right right so 

348.51 349.40 B: um 

350.60 353.86 B: i don't know i don't know how the government can do it it's um it's ah 

357.94 359.05 B: maybe 

359.59 363.93 B: (( who knows i don't know i'm just thinking out loud here um )) 

368.16 371.18 B: maybe they just have more frequent audits i don't know 

371.37 373.45 A: that's true more audits 

372.33 376.15 B: maybe that would ah maybe that would help some you know 

375.56 376.91 A: that that's true 

376.73 379.85 B: um and maybe the maybe the um 

380.04 382.56 B: the blame should be on to the auditors 

382.82 383.65 B: too 

383.48 384.98 A: well that's an idea 

384.10 388.66 B: maybe maybe they should also be investigated somewhat 

388.71 391.72 A: true if they're really doing you know what they're supposed to be doing 

390.52 398.16 B: see if they're doing their you know making sure they're not getting a kick back from from the company saying hey you passed this number on we'll 

398.02 399.14 A: oh 

398.49 399.58 B: (( we'll )) 

399.65 400.54 B: (( you know )) 

400.75 401.97 A: oh that's true 

400.97 402.44 B: make sure you get your 

402.54 404.71 B: [mn] big bonus pay out and all 

404.70 406.56 A: do you think that happens 

405.89 407.91 B: i don't know i don't know i mean 

408.10 409.82 B: ah who knows 

410.73 411.72 B: who knows 

411.96 413.21 B: so um 

414.00 415.26 B: it's hard to say 

415.24 418.88 A: mhm yeah some under the table thing going on 

415.64 417.12 B: but i mean it's 

417.52 429.61 B: well i mean the auditors are the ones checking the books and and they're um they're accounted they're supposed to be the ones that's supposed to be answering 

430.25 435.27 B: for the company so obviously they know something maybe they're not doing their job 

435.78 436.77 B: um 

436.92 438.12 B: (( enough )) 

438.34 439.56 A: that's true 

439.77 440.88 B: (( so um )) 

441.64 442.59 B: (( i don't know )) 

443.73 445.79 A: yeah more auditing and 

446.16 454.70 A: just tough consequences i'm not sure what else they could really they could really do without you know making it government controlled i guess 

452.37 453.06 B: yeah 

454.58 455.55 B: i don't know 

456.32 457.34 A: (( so )) 

457.79 459.91 A: (( i don't know um )) 

460.43 465.55 A: i hardly know of any i know enron was a big deal but can you think of any other ones 

465.79 469.82 A: that has happened recently besides other the medical one 

465.79 466.64 B: (( so )) 

466.94 467.66 B: mhm 

469.68 474.05 B: yeah there's a few others i can't right now think um 

474.73 475.80 B: um 

477.81 479.32 B: (( oh shoot there was )) 

481.81 484.04 B: oh i can't even think right now 

484.12 486.74 B: what the others there were some others i just 

486.95 494.44 A: yeah they just come and i don't think a person really hears about them too much unless they are a really big corporation corporation like enron 

492.38 497.11 B: mhm oh yeah there's lots of companies i'm sure that um 

498.57 510.49 B: [mn] that um have problems that they just you know unless you are the big cheese you're not gonna be it's not gonna be as noticed as as a um big company would be 

510.29 511.45 A: right 

510.57 511.54 B: (( you know ))
