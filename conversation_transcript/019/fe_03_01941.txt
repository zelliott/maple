88.82 90.39 A: mhm 

89.36 92.67 B: but for me what family is is 

93.69 97.34 B: anybody in the blood line or married into the blood line

116.15 126.96 A: husband's aunt she has friends that she's known for like twenty five years and you know thirty years and i'm thinking at at some point it just starts to become family [laughter] [laughter]

144.51 146.03 A: (( [noise] ahah )) 

146.96 158.71 B: we kinda lost each other for like ten years and because of the class reunion we managed to link back up and kinda just picked up right where we left of it was pretty amazing yeah yeah yeah 

149.58 150.81 A: oh my gosh 

151.64 153.32 A: mhm 

156.72 157.87 A: really was

163.38 164.25 A: yeah 

163.57 164.35 B: (( so )) 

164.60 169.50 A: well that's nice i have a friend like that to i've i've known her since seventh grade but you know 

165.69 166.39 B: (( [noise] but )) 

169.77 171.26 A: (( we kinda keep touch )) 

171.85 174.49 B: you know people kinda go in and out of your life 

173.92 177.08 A: (( yeah i notice that [noise] )) 

174.76 181.39 B: and it's it's kinda interesting to watch the girl that i knew since fifth grade um 

181.58 194.98 B: she married a guy that was in the military and moved all over the country um one of the few that didn't go out of the country but it's like okay once a year almost always we find each other you know and write christmas cards 

192.33 193.92 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

194.54 196.07 A: oh that's nice 

194.98 202.77 B: and i happen to go again another class reunion [laughter] found her again in person she didn't go but she was living in that town still 

198.46 199.68 A: [laughter] 

202.93 208.04 B: and it's kinda like we picked up where we left off that is nearly two years ago too so 

206.01 207.55 A: (( oh that's nice )) 

207.70 209.59 A: that's always good 

209.17 210.52 B: good friendships 

210.23 211.92 A: yeah yeah 

210.82 212.67 B: are lasting you know 

212.51 214.82 A: yeah no matter what 

212.79 216.13 B: when and when they disappear i always know there's something wrong 

216.37 218.59 A: really [laughter] 

217.39 222.21 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah like one one when she disappeared for ten years it was um 

222.29 232.19 B: a marriage problem and she dropped out of sight and the other one disappeared for a few years and and there was just a lot of stuff going on 

223.60 224.53 A: (( mm )) 

232.50 240.29 B: that it would have been good if i put more effort into finding her because she could have used an ear or a shoulder to cry on kinda thing 

239.52 241.28 A: (( oh that's too )) 

241.23 243.13 B: [laughter] that's a lesson for you 

241.91 242.62 A: (( bad )) 

242.83 249.84 A: well [laughter] but you know i guess that's the big difference between family and friends family you can't get rid of friends maybe 

244.28 245.28 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

250.00 251.41 A: they just dwindle away 

251.47 252.37 B: pardon me 

252.10 257.74 A: [noise] oh i'm i'm just saying that family you can't get rid of but friends you know but friends [noise] you know 

256.22 257.38 B: [laughter] that's true 

257.97 259.87 B: you don't get to choose your family 

258.05 259.25 A: [laughter] 

259.52 262.24 A: right exactly so [noise] [noise] 

261.77 271.85 B: [laughter] you're stuck with them but you know the other thing a i've noticed about that even if it's somebody you know a brother or sister or parent or something that you really don't like and 

270.50 271.93 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

272.31 277.85 B: i don't know there's that there's that family tie that brings you back and well you know if they really need you 

277.98 281.50 B: you're there or if you really need them they're there 

278.29 286.21 A: [noise] yeah yeah [noise] that's true that's true yeah [laughter] knock on wood 

281.91 282.91 B: i hope 

283.53 286.57 B: [laughter] i don't know if that's true with everybody but 

286.94 292.29 B: my daughter had a friend who was a foster child and he was still in touch with his his parents 

289.70 290.48 A: (( ahah )) 

292.00 293.24 A: wow 

292.72 302.14 B: and after he graduated from high school he was no longer eligible to do foster child so he was out in the world on his own and 

300.79 301.64 A: (( ahah )) 

302.49 314.09 B: couple of years later my daughter comes back telling me that his mom had gotten in touch with him and she was always a real problem case with drugs and and alcohol and anyway she 

314.49 321.56 B: gotten really really sick and ended up in hospital and didn't have any way to pay for it he felt obligated to pay for her medical bills 

321.27 322.93 A: (( oh no )) 

322.33 331.05 B: so you know here's a case of family in a worst possible situation and yet there's a a tie 

330.63 334.36 A: [noise] yeah yeah he felt obligated oh my goodness 

333.05 334.29 B: yeah 

334.45 336.20 A: that's a sad story 

335.87 337.81 B: yeah it really 

337.06 342.71 A: [laughter] my my husband's um mother or my mother in law she's um 

343.13 353.70 A: she was raised as a foster child and so she kinda has the same type of situation where she has family that she knew while she was in care but you know as soon as she was old enough 

353.76 358.26 A: you know they didn't step in to offer her anything it just kinda seems strange to me but 

358.79 363.20 A: you know or you know it's just very different yeah 

360.46 361.46 B: it's tough 

361.72 370.75 B: yeah there is a lot of situations like that i understand i belong to a quilting group and a couple of times one of the members has gotten up and said 

370.78 375.22 B: you know well we do charity quilts all the time anyway and 

373.68 375.09 A: [noise] oh 

375.07 388.52 B: so she was asking people to direct their quilts to this one organization and what they do is as each foster child turns eighteen years old they get a quilt because often often times that's about the only thing that they can call their own and take with them 

384.63 385.49 A: (( ahah )) 

386.82 390.27 A: oh yeah that's nice mhm mhm 

388.41 390.75 B: because they just get turned out 

390.49 396.09 A: yeah yeah so it's not much of a family structure and you almost wonder how how it affects them 

391.30 392.08 B: so 

396.19 399.80 A: you know i know it does but how does it change them or 

397.54 400.16 B: (( oh yeah very )) 

400.33 404.51 A: you know how how does that affect their own family when they you know 

404.70 416.05 A: have one and in this situation she got married or my mother in law got married and then you know had my husband and then that was it just one child and they ended up getting a divorce but so you know 

412.93 413.82 B: mhm 

416.30 421.86 A: you wonder how how much that impacted her life and ability to keep her own family together so 

421.81 426.16 B: that's true you know it kinda comes back to what does family mean to them 

422.70 423.93 A: yeah 

425.88 428.84 A: right right exactly you know and 

427.46 428.26 B: (( right )) 

428.34 429.99 B: well because fellow 

430.27 441.70 B: my daughter's friend i mean he had he was treated very very badly as a small child before he went into the foster care so for him family 

436.60 437.83 A: mhm 

441.66 446.97 B: in some cases means a lot of pain and a lot of rejection and a lot of 

444.27 445.43 A: right 

446.38 447.44 A: right 

447.10 450.55 B: problems so i don't know it would be interesting to watch 

448.24 449.39 A: yeah 

450.87 454.78 B: if we can stay in touch with him i believe he went into the army recently 

454.38 455.80 A: oh wow 

455.42 460.39 B: i don't know you know exactly where or if he ended up in the mid east or 

460.44 461.54 B: anything 

460.68 463.54 A: oh wow hopefully he's not [laughter] 

461.65 465.19 B: hopefully at some point somebody will get in touch with me again and say 

465.24 467.24 B: okay here's where he's at now
