18.82 21.01 A: yeah what what family means 

21.57 25.67 A: so i mean i what do you what do you think family means 

25.90 31.37 B: well um that's ah an interesting topic because i'm mormon 

30.72 31.90 A: oh really 

31.40 43.19 B: yeah and so the family could family is real important and like the families like the your bottom line in what with me what defines my rules and how i conduct myself 

34.64 35.55 A: mhm 

43.15 48.15 B: throughout my day and throughout my life so i ah 

45.98 46.96 A: mhm 

48.58 56.26 B: wasn't born mormon i i chose it just because of its stand on the family and so i think what 

56.41 64.49 B: when i see someone who's having problems in life or doing well in life i always credit the family negatively or positively 

62.44 63.49 A: mhm 

64.40 66.14 A: right 

66.23 68.47 B: so i'm sorry go ahead 

66.60 67.40 A: well 

68.31 71.31 A: oh i was going to were you are you were you an only child 

71.43 73.22 A: or do you have brothers and sisters 

71.94 74.54 B: yes i was an only child yes 

74.48 76.48 A: yeah me too i'm an only child 

75.91 87.90 B: oh really and see i'm an an adopted only child so my parents had to like apply and and had to ah get references to become a family to have a child 

76.83 77.66 A: yes 

87.90 88.92 A: oh really 

88.47 90.64 B: yeah 

89.36 91.35 A: how old were you when you were adopted 

90.95 92.75 B: two months old 

92.07 93.31 A: (( oh wow )) 

93.13 97.67 B: yeah [noise] and it's interesting that you're also an only child 

97.00 98.52 A: yes yes 

98.05 106.15 B: because i think that kind of shapes who your birth birth order or if you don't have any brothers or sisters kind of shapes you too 

106.42 110.22 B: in what you do in life and how you how you look at the world 

110.03 112.57 A: oh yeah my roommates are always 

112.84 120.01 A: telling me i'm an only child and i'm i'm spoiled to to no avail but i disagree i'm not spoiled i'm just you know 

120.25 122.03 A: i'm used to being an only child 

121.60 124.76 B: well that's interesting because um my 

125.09 126.22 B: friends 

126.44 131.48 B: always say that my strengths and my weaknesses are because i'm an only child 

131.37 132.21 A: right 

131.44 137.55 B: it was like [noise] i was spoiled at home but i was also taught manners outside the home 

137.25 138.12 A: right 

137.40 150.97 B: so i wasn't i was not allowed to act spoiled outside the home like i had to conduct myself appropriately in other people's homes and i had to conduct myself appropriately at school i couldn't get away with murder 

141.70 142.75 A: right 

150.86 152.54 A: oh exactly 

152.07 154.07 B: whereas at home of course 

154.36 160.39 B: i was the only one that mom and dad had to worry about so they didn't have the pressures that you know i have a friend who 

160.27 166.65 B: came from a big family so there's just fewer pressures when there's just one child 

163.89 164.87 A: mhm 

165.98 167.13 A: right 

166.53 175.73 B: but i am used to like when i see friends i i see my friends like one at a time i don't like crowds i don't like groups because i was always alone 

175.53 176.78 A: right 

177.37 178.89 B: so i um 

179.45 184.90 B: it's very easy for me to even now as i'm older it's easy for me to entertain myself 

184.84 186.16 A: oh yeah 

185.55 196.42 B: i don't get bored easily because i'm always used to you know i'm not lonely but i've you know when you're when you're a child you're growing up alone 'cause you don't have brothers and sisters to entertain you 

196.42 202.22 A: exactly oh yeah i can i can entertain myself for hours without without anyone else 

199.97 201.45 B: oh yeah 

202.71 210.20 B: oh yeah and people think i'm lonely and i'm just you know happy 'cause i'm not lonely at all i don't i don't need 

206.68 207.60 A: mhm 

208.11 209.01 A: right 

210.42 211.66 B: i don't need 

212.07 222.86 B: outside things although i have a lot of friends i don't i don't have to have them to to not be lonely you know and it sounds like you feel the same way 

215.63 216.66 A: right 

222.96 224.88 A: oh yeah yeah definitely i 

224.99 232.37 A: mean and i can i mean i'm also it it also kind of developed me into being more shy than everyone else 

232.07 233.38 B: okay me too 

232.42 240.94 A: you know because you don't you don't interact with you know a whole lot of other i mean you go to school you know when you're little and you play with all your classmates 

240.99 242.04 B: (( yeah )) 

241.08 247.43 A: but you're still you're still not you know going to sleep next to you know your brother every night you know and 

246.30 248.57 B: right right 

247.69 258.96 A: you know it makes you somewhat more shy than than you know someone than someone that comes from you know a family where they had you know two sisters and three brothers 

251.80 253.19 B: i would agree 

259.65 273.64 B: that i would agree but i had to work harder at having self confidence because i was always yeah it did make me a little shyer because when i went to college for the first time you know i had a roommate and i had to 

260.96 262.12 A: yeah 

265.15 266.06 A: right 

273.55 278.63 B: deal with the dorm and i had to deal with a big group of other guys 

276.74 277.62 A: yeah 

278.76 281.70 B: and that took me a while to adjust to 

281.85 283.12 A: mhm 

282.47 286.16 B: because i had never had to adjust to other people 

285.62 286.85 A: right 

286.34 291.57 B: because my it was just my my parents with me so i didn't have to 

291.88 296.50 B: it took me a while to adjust to a group of people so i totally totally agree with you 

294.66 295.50 A: right 

296.46 308.09 A: oh yeah yeah i mean i went from living you know just me and mom to going to having you know a roommate at college and i'm still in college now but i have i mean i live in a house now 

307.99 309.06 B: okay 

308.45 314.40 A: and but yeah i mean i did the dorm all that and i moved like three states away 

314.61 318.88 A: and went [noise] and went went to a school where i didn't know anyone at all 

314.74 315.66 B: okay 

317.92 320.43 B: yeah [noise] 

319.50 327.86 A: and that was it was quite a change and i go to the largest university in the country of course so i mean no no no no texas 

324.58 325.75 B: ohio 

327.97 329.20 B: really 

328.41 329.88 A: (( texas yes )) 

329.57 331.29 B: (( all right )) 

330.69 340.87 A: so technically we're the we're larger than ohio because we we don't count our ah part time students and they and they count part time students when they for their enrollment 

336.94 338.11 B: okay 

340.59 343.42 B: (( oh right )) 

341.48 343.33 A: so technically we're the largest 

344.21 347.50 B: wow i did not know that 

345.99 356.81 A: yeah i mean it's not a thing to brag about because i mean our classes are huge it gets kind of bad but yeah i mean i came here and didn't know a single person when i got here 

349.64 351.85 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

356.95 358.03 B: wow 

357.39 363.75 A: but it worked out to where i met you know some really cool kids and it worked out real well 

364.59 373.92 B: i just did the opposite i stayed in state and i went to a small lutheran college 'cause i i didn't think i could cope like you did 

373.65 376.06 A: (( mhm it was hard mhm )) 

374.22 386.53 B: i thought i would be because of being an only child i thought i would be overwhelmed and that i wouldn't be able to you know i would just be overwhelmed with it all so for me i made the right choice 'cause it was a 

383.88 384.78 A: yeah 

386.57 393.35 B: smaller school and it was in state it wasn't right in the same city but it wasn't that far away from my parents 

393.37 394.64 A: oh yeah 

394.09 402.94 B: yeah and i did okay because [cough] because of that fact i think i knew myself well enough that [noise] if i'd gone you know to a big school i would have just been 

403.14 405.59 B: i think swallowed up 

404.71 406.02 A: yeah 

406.03 407.39 B: and that for me was 

407.91 408.81 B: um 

409.45 413.94 B: [noise] the negative part about being an only child but it 

414.21 421.28 B: i really have stayed all my life with my parents' values and i've always 

419.07 420.42 A: mhm 

421.42 429.99 B: not done anything really really stupid because i didn't want to my parents were always very important to me in my life and i i you know i didn't want to ever 

427.34 428.52 A: right 

430.34 433.56 B: do anything too dumb that would disgrace them too much 

433.20 434.34 A: mhm 

433.95 435.14 B: so i think 

435.34 441.60 B: my family is probably the most the strongest pull on my every aspect of my life 

441.40 442.30 A: yeah 

442.34 444.30 A: oh yeah definitely for me too 

444.68 452.14 B: but it sounds like i was growing up more i was overprotected whereas you maybe were given more freedom 

451.50 455.38 A: oh oh i mean well yeah to an extent you know 

454.57 456.13 B: okay okay 

456.28 459.00 A: (( i mean it was i mean i went to ah )) 

459.09 463.62 A: the i went to a um an episcopal school like middle school 

463.22 464.38 B: okay 

463.80 467.11 A: and my mom worked the episcopal church that was right next door 

466.71 467.99 B: okay 

467.48 474.94 A: so if i got in trouble you know the teachers just walked right next door and you know were like hey your son your son's acting up and of course i got in trouble 

474.51 475.97 B: yeah 

475.31 477.70 A: so i mean i didn't get away with much then but then 

477.95 486.13 A: once once i hit high school you know my my parents they were pretty they were like okay you know you're going to go to college in four years so 

486.17 491.44 A: we're going to let you you know just make sure you don't mess up on your own 

491.25 492.89 B: yeah 

491.71 493.78 A: and you'll be ready for college 

494.19 502.95 A: so really like yeah once i hit high school they backed off and they weren't they never really hounded me about homework or you know anything real hard core like that 

502.36 503.69 B: okay 

503.78 508.48 A: so and it it worked because you know i hadn't hadn't bailed out of college yet so 

507.99 509.68 B: did you choose 

510.11 512.18 B: this college because it was so big 

512.12 515.14 A: oh well i i was born in texas 

514.91 515.90 B: okay 

515.49 525.50 A: so this is i've always wanted to come back to school here and i mean you know we have such a great they have a really good engineering school which is what i'm in right now 

519.59 520.57 B: (( all right )) 

525.06 526.30 B: okay 

525.88 534.35 A: and i mean our football team basketball team it's all it's all great so there's this is i i only applied to three schools and they were all in texas 

534.04 535.50 B: oh okay 

535.28 536.15 A: so 

536.43 542.73 A: yeah i i was basically set on texas by the time i was a sophomore in high school 

542.55 544.08 B: really 

543.38 546.94 A: yeah oh i knew i knew this is exactly where i wanted to go 

547.34 549.06 B: that is so cool 

548.18 549.02 A: (( yeah )) 

549.07 550.80 B: (( um what was i going to say )) 

551.27 556.24 B: but it sounds like it helped didn't you kind of go to a private middle school that episcopal school 

555.63 567.45 A: oh yeah my my middle school was it was tiny i had like my i think when i graduated like eighth grade it was it might have had like twenty three students maybe in my class 

566.95 568.26 B: okay 

568.01 573.29 A: but then my high school was really big i had like almost six hundred kids when i graduated in high school 

573.20 574.93 B: okay mine too 

574.98 577.83 A: so i gradually stepped up you know in size 

578.07 580.35 A: so it was it wasn't too bad 

581.08 583.23 B: and so now you live in a house 

582.84 584.38 A: yes i'm in a house 

584.15 586.21 B: okay like a fraternity 

586.20 592.53 A: oh no no no it's a it's just it's a four bedroom house like a couple of like 

590.82 591.97 B: (( oh okay )) 

592.75 594.72 A: ten blocks off campus 

595.28 597.20 B: i was just asking because i have friends who 

597.46 599.95 B: say they live in a house but it's a frat
