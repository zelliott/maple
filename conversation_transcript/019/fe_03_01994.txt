2.56 4.61 A: hi my name is gwen 

4.38 5.83 B: hi gwen 

6.82 10.11 B: so did you understand what the topic is about 

9.51 17.82 A: well a little bit i i listened pretty close because whenever they first called it didn't make any sense but after they had explained it a little more it ah 

17.96 20.69 A: it does make sense it seems like ah 

21.29 29.38 A: especially in the past year there seems to be more and more scandals that have affected so many lives and 

28.62 36.50 B: yeah enron and american airlines i'm right in the middle of an american airlines right now i live in dallas texas 

33.61 35.32 A: are you really oh 

36.27 41.70 A: i live in texas also and have quite a few friends that work for american it has been 

36.57 37.45 B: so 

40.45 41.53 B: yeah 

42.06 43.88 A: watching along and 

43.92 49.67 A: i used to work in the telecom industry so world com and ah 

49.79 57.38 A: and i used to have as one of my clients ah the big houston scandal that went on down there in 

56.44 57.46 B: yeah 

58.06 71.51 A: you know i i think it's sad in so many ways because the people that it affects don't have any say so at all in what's going on and nine nine times out of ten 

72.00 75.98 A: they don't they don't have an inkling that it's even happening 

76.31 77.62 A: until 

77.72 79.95 A: you know until the bottom falls out 

78.78 79.35 B: (( [cough] )) 

79.95 86.51 B: that's true i know and it not only affects their lives but you know how much money they spend 

86.16 87.13 A: mhm 

86.89 90.46 B: you know when they can't buy cars when they can't 

91.71 92.80 B: buy 

92.92 98.89 B: insurance and you know it it affects everybody so much and and 

94.48 95.62 A: oh yeah 

100.30 104.75 A: well it's it's i think it's it's tough you know because 

105.67 106.64 A: you know 

107.24 112.54 A: the big ones in the in the group usually come out less harmed 

112.67 116.12 A: than the worker bees like you and i you know 

114.95 116.37 B: yeah that's 

116.41 117.90 B: (( very true )) 

117.05 122.70 A: they end up with the golden parachutes that no matter how bad things are going to be 

122.80 123.83 A: um 

124.52 136.27 A: you know they were they were protected throughout i ah worked for motorola for a year ah in their ah iridium program which was a satellite phone program and it finally went bankrupt 

135.80 137.16 B: uh-huh okay 

136.43 142.37 A: but the interesting part was i knew what was happening as it was happening 

142.21 146.35 B: but was there a big rumor mill and it was real scary right 

145.75 151.66 A: oh yeah it yeah it was really scary but it was more palatable because 

151.81 153.12 A: we knew 

153.34 161.94 A: pretty much what was going on as it was happening we didn't know everything but it wasn't just where you walked in one day and boom it was over 

161.51 162.65 B: yeah 

162.31 167.51 A: like it has been with so many of you know the big the big companies that you know 

167.63 169.47 A: it's you know 

169.56 170.39 A: (( i )) 

170.67 180.87 A: you know a lay off is not fun but at least if you've been semi prepared for it and at least feel like there was no scandal involved i i think it's 

180.82 190.71 A: it's so much harder on these people whenever they find out later that you know funds have been misappropriated and their 401ks are gone and 

190.69 197.92 A: you know that there's fraud involved i you know in our situation it was just a matter of a lot of bad business decisions and 

197.93 212.09 A: and technology that was before its time and and things like that and that was much more palatable than knowing that the people who you've trusted you know have have not been making wise judgments 

211.62 212.73 B: yeah 

214.19 217.66 B: well and so what what can you do about it 

217.90 227.89 A: well i you know i think at the point where i am at i don't think there's a whole lot that that can be done you know i think most of the time it's over my head i mean don't you 

226.41 232.01 B: did your company did your company come in and help retrain or or 

231.70 242.07 A: oh yeah i got a wonderful severance package you know so i mean i you know i like i say you know i've been in several downsizings and lay offs and stuff and i have never 

232.40 233.28 B: yeah 

233.65 234.76 B: yeah 

242.20 247.95 A: ever been in a company where i had you know any inkling that there was fraud involved 

247.47 249.51 B: uh-huh well that was lucky 

248.29 256.07 A: how do you feel about the motorola ah or not the motorola i'm sorry the american airlines i mean did you feel cheated and 

256.12 257.63 A: um you know 

257.39 259.48 B: well it um 

260.00 263.55 B: you know the the news i think makes it scarier 

263.36 264.33 A: mhm 

263.69 266.75 B: than what's what's going on um 

267.71 270.73 B: i i don't know what those people are going to do 

270.94 275.81 B: you know what's it going to do to our economy as far as losing thousands of jobs 

275.99 284.17 B: in dallas you know what what about houses are they going to be able to you know support their homes their you know send their kids off to good 

284.17 294.30 B: schooling college or whatever and you know you just wonder what the what the big picture is like and and what did that guy just um um 

295.30 299.21 B: retire yesterday or whatever not retire 

298.17 299.94 A: yeah it makes you wonder 

299.32 302.01 B: resign he resigned yesterday 

301.60 303.72 A: he resigned but you know 

303.97 313.07 A: how did it really affect him you know was he really harmed in the deal or was he just given hush money to go away quietly 

305.25 306.49 B: yeah 

310.02 311.18 B: his name 

311.58 317.65 B: yeah his name is just sullied and everything but you know he went away 

318.15 327.51 B: quietly with his tail between his legs off to get another job or whatever because he is he is a prime guy for for a new job 

327.14 328.17 A: oh yeah 

327.75 334.33 B: he's creative and innovative and and whatever and and so you know you know he's going to get a 

333.31 338.25 A: well and what's sad is a lot of people probably don't think he really did anything wrong 

337.93 339.08 B: yeah 

339.21 341.23 A: you know he got caught 

341.51 344.62 A: you know and that's bad but 

344.83 345.73 A: you know 

346.23 351.80 A: so many people will feel like well he was just trying to do what was best for the company at the time 

351.40 354.78 B: and he couldn't be all eyes and all ears 

354.31 355.25 A: right 

354.87 356.21 B: (( yeah )) 

355.71 357.47 A: yeah so you know that's 

358.02 360.81 A: the part i don't really know that 

361.80 367.58 A: [sigh] you know i know one of the questions that they ask was do you think it affects the economy 

368.23 376.29 A: and [sigh] i don't know that it really affects the economy that much i think it affects people more than it affects the economy 

376.40 380.57 A: i mean yes if if american airlines was to go bankrupt and 

380.48 394.91 A: there was a lot of people laid off sure there's going to be a a ripple effect out into the you know into the workplace because they're people that you know are their suppliers are going to be affected and you know there is going to be a ripple effect but 

395.42 396.38 A: um 

396.45 402.11 A: other than that ripple effect i sad to say is i think people are getting used to 

402.84 406.43 A: being conned any more i think it's much more 

406.65 415.24 A: i don't want to use the word palatable but [sigh] it's almost more acceptable than thirty years ago when my parents were working 

415.36 421.04 B: yeah my dad can never understand why i've had so many jobs when he worked at michigan state for 

421.04 431.49 B: you know well over thirty years and even though he's retired he still is asked to come and do lectures and and do such and such even though he's in his eighties now 

431.40 438.43 B: you know and he can't understand why i've had so many jobs and it's like but daddy they don't want you 

438.72 445.02 B: you know like they they have no loyalty to you like you have to them 

438.92 439.70 A: yeah 

444.67 446.28 A: oh no no 

445.46 451.21 B: and you're just so easily replaced and here i am in my fifties and 

451.26 460.69 B: you know i have as much experience as a kid coming out of college but i want twice as much salary as they do 

460.40 461.79 A: oh of course 

461.50 465.22 B: and so you know because i've i've 

466.06 467.74 A: you deserve it 

466.79 472.19 B: i deserve it but yet they can get two people to replace me 

471.93 473.26 A: oh exactly 

472.97 481.04 B: and of course if they keep me then they are going to make me do two or three people's jobs and when i can't handle it 

478.03 479.31 A: (( exactly and )) 

481.56 483.27 B: and if i 

484.32 491.42 B: crab about it or whatever then you know i'm uncooperative or whatever and then 

491.21 494.14 A: then when the axe falls you'll be the first to go 

493.42 495.88 B: yeah yeah yeah 

495.17 498.58 A: yeah i think that's the that is the key 

498.64 505.91 A: that is hard for people our age as we watched our parents with the same job for twenty thirty years 

505.98 510.06 A: and our society any more is just not set up that way 

510.22 524.74 B: and my daddy used to take a month or a month and a half vacation we used to go places we went to europe we went to mexico we went and did fun cool things together and now you know if if you're sick for one day 

524.81 535.82 B: then the work on your desk is is not taken over by somebody or it hasn't you know it's not passed off to somebody or shared it's like there when you get there 

529.94 530.73 A: no 

535.44 536.40 A: mhm 

536.11 537.59 B: and um 

538.07 544.31 B: so yeah the um the loyalty from corporations is not what it used to be 

539.15 540.27 A: (( yeah )) 

544.47 550.55 A: no it's not no it's it's it's a totally different society and you know the 

550.46 562.39 A: the thing about the lay offs and things you know whether it affects our economy i think is what's sad is people are very accepting of the fact nowadays if you go on a job interview 

562.31 572.06 A: it's not the stigma that it used to be if you've had five jobs in the last three years you know i was reading an article about that and you know 

568.05 569.01 B: yeah 

572.46 573.42 A: i think 

572.47 576.80 B: just as long as you use the appropriate word you know that was a 

577.39 590.75 B: cezanne or a downsizing or you know the company moved or whatever like my my husband's company moved um from dallas to new jersey and they offered him 

580.15 581.61 A: oh yeah 

590.83 599.36 B: the same salary that he was making here for a move to new jersey well but the cost of living up there is more 

598.75 599.56 A: yes
