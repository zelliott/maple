148.21 149.26 A: (( company )) 

151.63 161.59 A: you know so i think i think all of that corporal corporate scandal has hel- has really um put a damper on many people you know um 

161.41 167.50 A: not just from a working perspective but also from the stock market and the way the economy moves 

167.43 171.25 B: [cough] right because um even myself i want a um 

171.33 183.11 B: i mean my company is not under no scandal but because of the um economy and because i invested a lot of mo- money into the stock the value of the stock is not worth 

183.27 185.00 A: right exactly 

183.95 186.26 B: is not worth anything 

185.35 196.43 A: yeah i i i hear you there you know i mean a year ago you know i i i remember three or four years ago you know looking at my husband's company it was like a hundred dollars a share 

196.36 202.17 A: and you know now he comes home and says oh we broke thirty five today and it's like hurray 

202.03 203.63 B: [laughter] 

202.15 216.45 A: you know i mean just [laughter] and you know you're looking for that small little jump you know he was talking the other day about selling at forty dollars a share and i'm sitting here thinking you know four years ago we would have laughed at such a thought you know 

216.35 218.70 B: right right 

216.78 218.09 A: but um 

218.48 233.37 A: i don't know i i i don't know what the government can do about corporate scandal and ah except put may- maybe um stiffer penalty well not really stiffer penalties but maybe stiffer regulations on auditing 

233.21 245.96 A: um you know i think that you know these fortune five hundred companies and these really big corporations that have stockholders like this i think they really need to be audited on a yearly basis by an independent 

246.41 257.51 A: auditing firm um you know and and i think audits need to be done on the auditing firms i mean you know i think that's the only way unfortunately we live in a society where 

247.90 249.72 B: exactly exactly 

258.41 260.55 A: not only do people 

261.77 275.97 A: um you know move around in a in a vicarious position but they also i don't think people really take their jobs all that seriously any more so i think mistakes are made whether intentionally or unintentionally 

271.90 272.72 B: no 

275.77 279.46 A: and i think the only way to get around that is to do more checking 

279.94 283.67 B: oh yes and because if if they start doing a check and balance 

283.72 284.91 B: (( on um )) 

284.90 299.76 B: corporate america [laughter] they already complained about how the government does a check and balance on each other that might curtail some of the ah the the scandal but like you say it depends on the individuals that they're hiring and it also depends on the 

297.70 301.66 A: yeah and i and i think i think that they should also 

301.92 306.89 A: [sigh] i think they should also when they find these um 

306.93 321.66 A: you know things that have have been done illegally and knowingly done illegally i think they really need to push these people's buttons and put them where they belong i mean i think they need to set examples of these people 

321.66 332.03 A: you know i don't know how many ah enron executives are actually going to end up behind bars but i don't think there's going to be too many of 'em and i and i certainly don't think it's the top level 

328.82 329.63 B: no 

332.15 334.89 A: you know that are going to end up behind bars 

334.86 344.49 B: right and then it also goes on the on the on the on the fact of if the person was on the inside working for enron or any company for that matter 

344.50 351.18 B: how much information do they know and did you can look at it one or two ways did they try to tell someone about it did 

349.82 351.85 A: mhm yeah 

350.98 361.73 B: they try to you know stop the practices that were going on or did they get like a little pay off like okay you know that we're [laughter] that we're doing something illegal 

354.35 355.23 A: yeah 

360.52 361.78 A: yeah 

361.74 364.09 B: you know you scratch my back 

362.34 367.25 A: and not only and and once they're caught are they are they then paying off 

367.20 373.53 A: you know these big lawyers to get them off the rap you know to blame it on to somebody else i mean you know 

373.31 382.64 A: it just seems that the more money you have and the more money you can steal the better off your chances of getting away with it you know which which unfortunately 

379.63 382.11 B: exactly exactly 

383.17 394.02 A: has just multiplied over the years you know it just um it it just seems to me that if someone has stolen you know a billion dollars they should be in the same prison 

393.91 398.84 A: with you know everybody else you know i mean they shouldn't be 

396.78 398.67 B: right it's almost like 

398.83 405.82 B: a repeat performance of like o._j. simpson or one of those big type trials like okay he is very known well known 

401.28 402.15 A: yeah 

405.32 407.95 A: yeah and he's going to get off yeah 

407.03 415.02 B: uh-huh let's get a dream team together and we're going to play this out as long as possible [laughter] 

412.73 421.06 A: that's right that's right you know i i think the i think the i think the government has to be more focussed on um 

421.85 428.72 A: you know things that are really illegal and things that are you know just savvy business moves like the whole 

428.87 435.49 A: you know trying to get bill gates and microsoft i mean i think that was just a total waste of money 

432.43 433.64 B: right 

435.26 446.36 A: i mean they they couldn't prove any wrong doing there's there was nothing devious that microsoft was doing i mean they weren't trying to bilk people out of money i mean 

435.73 436.91 B: [laughter] 

444.75 445.41 B: [laughter] 

446.19 459.99 A: or anything like that yes they were trying to make a buck for themselves but isn't that the reason we are in business maybe instead of spending a billion dollars chasing bill gates maybe we could have spent a billion dollars getting osama bin laden 

452.57 453.44 B: right 

460.27 463.77 B: and that was just a jealousy factor because of he had 

463.20 467.55 A: that's all it was that's all it was i mean bill gates has never 

463.80 464.53 B: the 

467.69 472.92 A: done anything illegal in his life he gives billions of dollars to charity every year 

472.84 473.78 B: yeah 

472.87 487.24 A: um microsoft employs more more people than anybody else in the world they give to so many charities and yet they went after them with a vendetta as though they were organized crime 

487.79 495.65 A: you know i mean i just think that the government is misplaced in you know what they're trying to do you know i you 

487.90 488.71 B: right 

495.85 500.16 A: know it's all a political thing and i think this whole um 

500.20 507.72 A: corporate scandal thing has just you know i i think it's fallen by the wayside you don't even hear about it any more 

507.77 519.23 B: no and then then once it gets into the scandal then it gets into well this is our first amendment right we have the freedom to do this or we have the freedom to do that and 

517.92 522.34 A: oh yeah they all have the right yeah they have the right to do everything yeah yeah 

521.00 532.77 B: and then it brings up a whole different ball game like wait a minute you just [laughter] you just embezzled millions of dollars of the company's money for something that doesn't have any fancy business or you just 

532.81 533.85 A: yeah 

532.95 536.54 B: (( sold the money you know what i mean [laughter] )) 

535.84 538.43 A: yeah i i don't understand it 

538.53 552.04 A: i don't understand it but you know it it just seems that the government has really misplaced their ah loyalties and um and you know really misplaced where they should be putting their efforts 

538.58 541.22 B: (( [laughter] )) 

547.94 548.61 B: (( [cough] )) 

552.12 553.97 A: you know i think um 

552.47 553.53 B: right 

554.16 558.51 B: then it goes back to like even if you start in a corporation what type of um 

558.73 566.08 B: ah rules are in place so when a person decides to start up a corporation what type of procedures do they have to go through 

565.84 567.41 A: yeah to make it 

566.51 567.41 B: (( on a )) 

567.52 568.63 A: to make it 

567.93 577.51 B: check and balance all the way from the time that the company signs the document and go into a corporation or do they just okay this is what you need to do x. y. and z 

577.52 580.43 B: follow this and then you have your corporation 

580.27 583.90 A: yeah but unfortunately the um 

584.72 590.88 A: unfortunately it's the little guy with the small company that's going to um pay 

590.79 599.89 A: because he's not he's not going to be able to follow all these procedures that are in place because of these you know big corporations and
