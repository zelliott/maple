409.22 421.86 A: ah which if i could have another guaranteed girl i have four boys and a daughter i'd have another one but since there's no guarantees she's been easier than any of the boys put together 

421.34 422.79 B: [laughter] 

422.28 427.37 A: maybe that'll change people tell me in the next couple of years but so far she's been a blessing

429.16 439.32 A: well tell me something if it's [mn] you know [mn] we were just talking before this phone call came that you know it it seems like they take turns and we never know which one is

445.20 446.19 B: right 

446.08 447.88 A: you know it's constant but

452.50 453.93 B: yeah help each other out 

453.71 455.88 A: yeah so [laughter] 

454.38 456.99 B: yeah i guess that's the main the main thing is 

458.04 467.76 B: ah i ac- i actually called in tonight because um i got a phone a couple of phone calls and i i tend to screen my calls 'cause we get a lot of you know ah 

467.73 482.14 B: soliciting and stuff like that and then i told my husband i said ah maybe it's that phone call thing's calling me so i need to you know call in and see if i can get on one of them because you know i can't guarantee that i will e- even pick up the phone 

468.95 470.02 A: right right 

481.73 482.85 A: right 

482.16 486.46 B: so um i figure it's well if it's important they'll leave a message i can call right back 

486.10 487.34 A: right 

486.91 500.71 B: so um so i go well let me call in and see and ah i- i had actually called in earlier today and i couldn't get through 'cause i think where i work there's a call waiting system and they said that call waiting would knock you off or whatever and i couldn't get through so 

498.77 499.65 A: (( uh- huh )) 

500.75 509.32 B: i already knew what the topic was and like ah i guess i can talk a little bit [laughter] about the family 'cause i got bob's family and my family and 

509.59 510.71 B: you know just 

510.91 511.78 A: yeah 

510.95 511.92 B: i don't know 

511.83 517.22 A: yeah well i got lucky ah [mn] knock knock knock on wood but when i met my wife 

517.15 530.49 A: ah her mother passed away when she was younger and ah she'd ne- never really had a the father got re- married and nev- there was conflicts there and so she never really had a continuing relationship with her father after that 

530.39 539.95 A: so i practically met a girl who didn't [mn] i met a girl who didn't have a mother and did not have a relationship really with her father so i have no real in- laws 

540.21 546.51 A: so i don't have to deal with that end of it of the holidays and christmas and all that stuff of ah 

546.52 550.68 A: you know wh- who's parents are we going to for thanksgiving and 

549.91 553.15 B: well that's true but how does she get along with your parents 

553.31 558.77 A: ah mine [mn] she did fine but ah they've both passed on since and ah 

556.80 558.15 B: yes right 

559.15 564.28 A: so we're both ah in- law- less [laughter] and ah 

562.27 563.25 B: [laughter] 

563.46 566.14 B: well you will be in- laws soon 

566.38 580.17 A: yes this is true yeah yeah yeah well [mn] there's we're worried about one of them [laughter] the one we who we'd hoped he one will meet a girl and you know like you said and it's you being a teacher this generation is a whole different world 

570.58 571.84 B: [laughter] 

580.03 582.04 A: of these kids of you know 

582.25 583.39 A: (( ah )) 

583.40 588.04 A: nobody wants commitments in these teenagers and twenty year olds and 

587.98 599.89 A: i don't know what you see down there but ah as far as our kids it's you know this is everybody's friends and everybody goes out together and but this commitment [mn] we're only gonna see each other and they don't want to know
