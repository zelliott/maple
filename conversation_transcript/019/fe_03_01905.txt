325.70 327.90 A: right and you turn out to be so different 

327.81 331.75 B: right and i just never understood that it will come to me 

329.74 336.97 A: that's that's how me and my sister i mean my sister still she moved back in with mom my parents and and ah 

337.26 342.34 A: and i remember when my husband's parents had passed away um you know went through all the 

342.68 347.07 A: ordeal of um having to move everything and sell the house and 

347.02 361.24 A: it was a lot of work trying to get rid of all that junk that they had and i remember um after you know they had passed and we went through that whole whole ordeal i told my parents um look you all need to try to get rid of some of your junk you have 

350.70 351.83 B: mhm 

361.23 362.26 B: right 

361.52 372.49 A: because when you pass away it's not going to be fair to leave all that on me and jenny so so we can get your house ready to sell it and i remember my mom saying you're not going to sell my house [laughter] 

372.59 381.09 A: okay and she said well where where's jenny and ashley going to go her she has daughter and i say well 

372.67 373.79 B: okay 

379.45 380.35 B: okay 

381.17 390.42 A: she's just going to give her the house [laughter] so of course i got pinned the selfish one [laughter] at a high 

388.26 391.13 B: so that's just being the the realistic one 

391.21 398.42 A: i have had to everything i have my cars my furniture everything i have worked for [laughter] you know some some 

396.03 397.05 B: right

423.96 424.85 A: uh-huh 

424.70 426.37 B: and when something breaks

430.98 432.98 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

433.21 436.04 B: or fix what her kid has broken 

434.43 437.75 A: (( [noise] )) 

436.31 441.96 B: or replace something for normal wear and tear she feels it's his his responsibility 

441.51 451.47 A: mhm i think you know what i think it all boils down to i think all across the world we all have the ex- exact same family we just all look different [laughter]
