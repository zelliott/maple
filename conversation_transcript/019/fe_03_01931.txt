46.96 47.77 A: okay 

47.49 53.91 B: um [sigh] i just got married like a month ago so um i think that family 

54.69 65.58 B: um is starting to mean a lot more to me you know like i have i have a mum and a dad and um all of that but um now that i have got married it's like 

66.28 78.26 B: you know there's somebody else that i have to focus on and then um where we wanna have kids so it's kind of like your whole attitude towards family life changes when it's 

78.90 80.02 B: two of you 

80.07 80.90 A: right 

80.18 82.39 B: (( you know what i'm saying [sigh] )) 

80.98 82.01 A: right 

82.06 86.37 A: yeah no i understand completely because um 

86.41 95.71 A: my family has been very disconnected because um hold on the second [noise] being recorded on my answering machine [noise] 

96.48 97.38 A: okay 

97.70 98.85 A: um 

99.78 106.00 A: [cough] 'cause my parents split up when i was a kid and um 

106.70 109.21 A: then my sister passed away 

109.77 110.82 A: um 

110.89 115.02 A: like in her twenties and so then it was just me and my mum 

115.53 117.08 A: and uh 

117.61 128.00 A: you know so it was kind of like very disconnected and now that i started my own family cause i'm married also and i we just had a baby he's uh eighteen months 

127.42 128.45 B: (( mhm oh )) 

128.50 132.00 A: i you know i'm focusing more on 

132.60 137.61 A: my immediate family my immediate family has changed it's no longer 

135.82 136.88 B: right 

137.70 140.66 A: you know what was it's more what is 

140.36 141.21 B: right 

141.00 142.78 A: so i understand that 

142.35 147.56 B: yeah and i understand where you're coming from 'cause my parents got divorced when i was a year old 

147.03 148.34 A: oh okay 

147.92 158.82 B: so my dad is actually my step dad 'cause i don't have any contact with my real dad since the wedding [laughter] don't want any contact with him 

150.70 151.74 A: mhm 

154.16 155.28 A: oh okay 

156.32 157.37 A: yeah 

158.37 159.42 A: (( wow )) 

160.11 164.46 A: so you haven't had any contact since you were a year old 

164.10 172.58 B: no we've had a little bit of contact um it was my mum and i from the time i was a year old up until i was seventeen 

172.23 173.25 A: mhm 

172.64 178.48 B: and we kind of had contact with my dad was not the type of dad that you would want he didn't 

178.35 190.88 B: try to see me he didn't want to see me he took us to court i mean it was horrible and um we started getting a relationship back together and then he made his own other family and kind of left me out 

182.87 183.80 A: mhm 

190.66 191.64 A: (( mm )) 

191.18 192.30 B: so 

192.32 198.97 B: we haven't um we haven't really had much contact for two years but he was invited to the wedding and he came 

198.58 199.90 A: yeah 

199.31 203.14 B: he almost didn't come cause my step dad walked me down the aisle but 

202.56 205.59 A: oh he he was resentful about that 

205.41 215.02 B: yeah and then my husband his family is close so it's kind of it's hard for him to understand you know when i get upset because my dad's not around and things like that 

209.19 210.17 A: mhm 

214.42 217.64 A: yeah i have exactly the same situation where 

217.66 222.16 A: my father's family is very close they're in meshed even 

222.17 223.26 A: you know they're 

223.42 224.91 A: mostly all 

225.18 230.44 A: on the east coast and [mn] they're very much in each others life 

230.79 237.33 A: and my family is all over the place you know cousins and what not they're very spread out 

233.74 234.75 B: mhm 

237.38 240.21 A: and very distant from each other 

240.90 241.68 A: so 

241.56 249.67 A: it was kind of hard for me to get into this pattern of attending all these family functions and you know 

249.52 264.42 A: like getting used to a routine of being with family again [mn] um like i kind of fought it the first two years that we were dating and wh- after we got married but then [mn] now it's become pretty natural 

252.91 253.84 B: right 

264.28 272.16 A: where i'm not fighting it any longer and i kind of like it [mn] um and as a matter of fact like at our wedding 

267.73 268.82 B: yeah 

272.23 276.39 A: i was kind of that was my family because 

276.48 287.67 A: since they are all over the place they're you know not as much participation on my side of the family as there was on his like his family all came 

287.70 290.63 A: you know and it was expected that they would come 

287.72 288.68 B: mhm 

290.68 294.83 A: where as like on my side of the family it was pretty optional [mn] 

295.89 299.17 A: and yes as far as my father he had 

299.26 300.26 A: died 

300.54 303.31 A: i guess about five years ago 

303.38 305.83 A: and i 

306.04 308.48 A: you know kind of like wondered 

309.03 314.13 A: how comfortable i would have been with him even being at my wedding because he was an alcoholic 

313.97 315.15 B: yeah 

314.55 318.47 A: and i just wouldn't of been able to trust him 

318.50 320.41 A: being sober that day 

320.51 322.61 A: (( you know so it would have of been uncomfortable )) 

323.37 326.64 A: and so i didn't really have to make that choice 

326.22 327.89 B: (( yeah yeah it was )) 

328.04 329.99 B: hard on my wedding 'cause like 

330.44 335.72 B: my whole family doesn't get along like my grandmother which is my mum's mum 

332.45 333.79 A: oh [laughter] 

336.23 346.84 B: doesn't get along with us and then my mum's sisters doesn't get along with i mean it's it's it pause pretty messed up so of course we were worried that somebody was gonna 

343.73 344.57 A: mhm 

348.09 354.10 B: you know do something [laughter] everybody acted alright [laughter] 

348.84 350.21 A: create the scene 

351.83 355.86 A: [laughter] yeah yeah every thing was so i 

356.40 366.38 A: guess you know i did have a few resentments about people who didn't show up you know and just didn't even respond to invite 

366.28 376.40 A: cause i stay connected with the whole family i'm one of the few people who have you know most of my cousins like they don't really stay in touch with the other cousins but 

376.36 381.89 A: i'd like to travel a lot so i am always visiting you know this one or that one and [mn] 

382.15 386.14 A: so i kind of stay in touch with everybody and um 

384.22 385.17 B: mhm 

386.59 392.53 A: i go to their weddings you know so like i'm going to one next week in florida 

392.57 399.87 A: and my mother's down there any way so i want her to see the baby you know 'cause we haven't been down there in about six months 

397.47 398.38 B: mhm 

400.04 401.06 A: um 

401.93 408.94 A: but you know i would i would go anyway you know cause i think that you should be there for the occasion 

408.70 409.78 B: yeah 

410.05 410.97 A: um 

410.10 411.48 B: and family's 

411.62 416.90 B: important and i think i started to realize that word lately with 

417.52 424.00 B: um you know my step dad and i getting closer and then being a part of my husband's family 

423.73 425.02 A: yeah 

424.82 428.33 B: because before i thought family was my mum [laughter] 

428.12 429.16 A: right 

428.98 433.11 B: and now you know you find out that there is more than that 

432.70 437.20 A: right yeah we're not even sure like [mn] 

437.53 441.57 A: you know i kind of would like to have another baby um 

442.09 445.44 A: just so that it is a bigger unit 

445.31 446.81 B: mhm 

446.24 447.43 A: um 

447.62 450.54 A: 'cause you know i guess like 

450.56 453.28 A: i'm kind of an only child now you know and 

453.45 467.63 A: it's so fleeting you know and to see like you know like if my when my mother passes away that's it you know my immediate family and i guess you know i would like to build a bigger family but at the same time 

460.37 461.19 B: right 

467.71 471.56 A: i don't know if i have to energy the stamina 

471.61 480.29 A: to kind of do it 'cause i'm older i'm in my forties and started a family late you know so 

480.92 482.57 A: i'm just thinking 

482.59 485.49 A: it's kind of rough to start it now 

485.34 486.49 B: (( mhm right )) 

485.85 490.18 A: you know if i was in my twenties maybe i would have more energy to do it 

490.81 492.80 A: so it's something we've been saying like 

492.88 493.91 A: i kind of 

494.13 497.77 A: would probably do it but my husband's not willing to 

497.87 501.86 A: h- unless like i took over all the responsibility 

501.63 502.94 B: oh wow 

502.06 505.48 A: [laughter] 'cause he thinks it's too much work 

505.10 506.28 B: yeah 

505.67 512.12 A: and he doesn't really want to do the work 'cause you know when he was growing up his mother did it all 

511.77 513.11 B: yeah 

512.29 514.88 A: and he kind of expects me to do it all 

514.93 516.78 A: so we have a lot of 

516.52 517.98 B: different views 

517.39 520.02 A: yeah and we have difficulty 

520.21 522.49 A: over it you know we've sought 

522.58 527.17 A: out counselling over it because i'm just not on that mind set 

526.91 528.00 B: yeah 

527.36 535.47 A: i'm a modern woman you know and i just don't believe that my job is to diaper and feed and you know you 

535.49 539.70 A: don't have to do any thing except you know get waited on 

539.80 545.32 B: yeah i'm pretty much lucky 'cause my husband understands that if we have kids you know 

545.26 555.12 B: he has to take care of them as well as me and we worked an out where he'll just have to work his job at night and i'll have to work my work mine during the day so that we can both be there 

554.63 555.83 A: yeah well 

555.87 557.07 A: you know we 

557.53 563.37 A: i thought we had that agreement too because he seems to be you know very 

563.77 573.34 A: modern also you know where he really didn't seem that way when we were first married you know he helped clean up and stuff you know he wasn't the type that wanted to be waited on 

573.36 582.05 A: and it but after the baby came and he saw the work that was involved all of a sudden you know it was just like he didn't want the work 

581.64 582.62 B: right 

582.11 586.29 A: so he kind of started taking this different attitude 

586.37 595.45 A: and um he was working at night which really worked out well because [mn] you know we could do shifts um 

595.47 599.89 A: but he really just didn't want the responsibility stop it
