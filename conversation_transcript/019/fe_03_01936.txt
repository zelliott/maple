529.79 531.18 A: that company is 

531.31 538.24 A: isn't doing that great and actually people are getting laid off and forced into retirement so we're probably here a lot longer than we wanted to be

560.36 561.65 A: (( yeah )) 

562.00 570.72 A: that was kind of one of the conditions of us moving so far away we'd we'd try to have another child and it happened really quickly so it was a
