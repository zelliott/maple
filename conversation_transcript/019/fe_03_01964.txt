0.00 1.06 A: karen 

0.74 2.07 B: lyn 

2.61 4.31 B: hi how are you where are you 

4.17 6.50 A: i'm in ah louisville kentucky 

5.99 8.59 B: okay i'm in canada actually montreal 

8.54 10.00 A: oh wow [laughter] 

9.14 17.04 B: [laughter] okay the question was ah about the illegal activity in corporate america i believe okay 

15.38 16.11 A: (( yes )) 

16.35 17.59 A: yes 

17.58 23.88 B: well i don't know about you but it ah i no longer trust ah 

24.46 29.97 B: accountants i feel that a lot of the business probably are doing the same and we don't know about it 

30.31 32.64 A: i i feel the same too um 

32.81 42.60 A: a lot of things that are happening in corporate america the general public is not brought about upon ah especially stockholders or not being aware of what's going on there either [noise] 

43.56 46.67 A: get out and close the door i'm sorry [laughter] 

44.73 47.25 B: (( [laughter] that's okay that's okay )) 

46.87 47.79 A: [noise] 

48.36 49.57 A: just close the door 

51.18 55.28 A: [noise] corporate america is not being brought up on what's going on um 

55.69 66.65 A: the the stockholders are not even aware of what's going on because what they put in their year in paperwork is what they want to say it's not necessarily what has happened 

66.46 67.65 B: yeah 

67.22 71.80 A: and i think that reflects into the stock market too because no one trusts anything any more 

71.09 73.95 B: exactly exactly i think 

74.21 82.82 B: maybe part of the business ah the problems are businesses so big that nobody knows what anybody else is doing so people can get away with a lot of things 

82.35 83.47 A: i agree 

83.14 86.33 B: yeah so um i don't know what the answer is 

86.36 95.74 B: but definitely more monitoring is and i think it's good that they are starting to check into it and i hope they continue that because we need more confidence in 

95.87 97.88 B: in the business people 

98.05 99.04 A: right 

99.20 99.97 A: (( um )) 

100.79 105.83 A: i i look forward to thinking that once what's going on in the world today 

105.86 111.17 A: once that ends and we can get back to what the home problems are 

110.75 111.74 B: (( yeah )) 

111.42 118.76 A: ah that at that point they can give more ah actually government regulations into private businesses 

118.40 119.37 B: mhm 

118.83 120.50 A: even even um 

121.58 125.65 A: stockholder held businesses that they can get more accounting in there 

125.69 134.73 A: and independent accounting i guess would be the best way to phrase that because right now the in home accounting or the hired accounting can easily be swayed 

135.09 139.95 B: yeah or it can be bought you can buy for for what somebody that you want them to do 

140.08 141.31 A: exactly 

140.21 145.82 B: and they're and they're loyal to the person that ah hires them because i've seen that on small scales 

146.06 150.20 B: um so you know you almost have to have open books and ah 

150.95 155.85 B: people like you know people more than one person that can check the books on a regular basis 

155.86 160.46 A: yes the accounting firms need to be held i think they need to be held more accountable too 

160.58 161.75 A: for 

161.87 164.03 A: what is being done 

164.19 167.94 A: the it's almost like the accounting firms need to be audited as well as 

168.07 171.05 A: um the firms that the accounting firms are auditing 

170.76 173.25 B: (( yes yes i agree )) 

173.63 177.08 B: (( [cough] i don't know i think it's bit like lawyers it's um )) 

177.67 180.59 B: ah i don't know it's 

181.99 186.15 B: accountants ah or the record keeping 

186.41 188.06 B: is um 

189.16 190.71 B: (( how should i say it )) 

191.45 196.30 B: let me think about this i haven't thought any kind of a wind and way i'm sorry 

192.92 194.54 A: [laughter] 

196.03 197.09 A: that's okay 

196.84 198.14 B: um 

198.34 199.22 B: anyway 

199.23 201.16 B: ah yeah you're right 

201.23 209.64 B: i think we need to get back to to something smaller and i think ah they need more monitoring like i said 

209.58 218.94 B: ah and i am i'm anxious for everything to get back to normal because values are not what they should be and i think that's reflected in family life everywhere 

219.03 221.62 B: so it obviously spills into business 

222.36 223.10 B: um 

222.45 223.24 A: yes 

223.64 226.59 B: so we the problem is probably very deep 

223.87 224.44 A: [noise] 

226.90 227.78 A: yes 

227.72 236.17 B: um more than it's a symptom i think of our society probably and we're as much responsible for it as anybody else i suppose 

236.08 238.34 A: and it's probably much more elaborate 

238.45 240.98 A: than anyone could ever imagine it being 

240.69 243.33 B: yeah and more complex and ah 

244.02 247.76 B: i guess people get too big and it's just like power corrupts almost 

247.38 249.12 A: ((  )) 

250.79 251.63 B: (( yes )) 

252.73 261.46 A: away with anything and then you turn around and look at these companies that are going bankrupt or close to bankrupt that yet they are still paying their c._e._o.'s these exorbitant amounts of bonuses 

259.83 261.14 B: (( oh yeah )) 

261.20 263.15 B: (( yeah you )) 

262.62 263.36 A: (( yes )) 

263.17 265.86 B: you don't have to go too far for that you can start with governments 

265.70 267.06 A: [laughter] 

265.98 270.85 B: [laughter] their retirees get the pensions that none of us will ever get 

270.80 271.90 A: oh yeah 

271.88 273.27 B: so it's ah 

273.42 275.29 B: (( i don't know it's ah )) 

275.87 279.69 B: we need to get back to basic principles of way back 

280.07 289.12 B: and ah i don't know if that will ever happen i think it may be crises are necessary to bring back balance and maybe everything that's happening in the world right now 

289.45 300.91 B: is for a reason i mean a bigger reason that we don't know about like up there i guess i'm a bit i'm a bit ah spiritual also so that's affected my thinking 

294.61 295.56 A: oh yeah 

299.01 300.33 A: yeah i think 

301.18 304.96 A: yeah i agree with you i do everything does happen for a reason 

305.02 305.91 A: (( ah )) 

305.60 317.11 B: at a at the perfect time in that we may not understand it and i think things will ah change and sometimes we need something to be really jolted for things to really change 

317.26 323.43 A: i think in a way with the stock market falling as it has it's given people more reason 

320.24 322.37 B: yes people are scared 

323.35 334.16 A: to go and reevaluate things that they were just taking for granted before which is how a lot of these c._e._o.s and agencies got away with what they did because people didn't really look 

334.18 335.74 A: and question 

335.31 336.35 B: mhm 

335.73 337.95 A: what was go going on they just thought oh 

337.86 351.71 A: i'm getting this much money back from this much stock and i'm doing this and hey you know i just i want everything go because i'm making money which in the long run should not be the way things go money it's become a money driven society and 

344.99 345.73 B: (( okay )) 

350.72 352.58 B: oh yeah yeah for sure 

352.68 364.87 A: and that's what it has come down to and as long as these people are getting money that's all really all they cared about and what they've got themselves into now is they had everything all lined up and now with the things that have gone on at home 

356.94 357.88 B: mhm 

364.84 369.17 A: in ah the world everything um 

369.43 372.75 A: then they are finally starting to see hey wait a minute maybe i 

372.95 374.74 A: should take a better look 

374.88 381.32 A: at what is going on how how is my money being used in this area and how is my money being used in that area 

381.39 382.59 A: and 

383.28 385.24 A: reevaluate that 

385.37 394.27 B: it's i wonder if it's so big i wonder if it will ever come to pass it's i think things are too big corp- corporations are too big everything is too big 

394.36 396.58 B: and um for my in my 

396.99 401.37 B: and whenever something is that big you lose control nobody has got control 

401.45 402.55 A: oh yeah 

401.85 404.08 B: (( there is there's no way c._e._o.s can not be )) 

404.20 408.78 B: cannot keep track of everything i mean it's impossible it's impossible 

406.17 407.00 A: (( uh-huh )) 

409.41 418.12 B: so ah i think we need to demerge instead of merging [laughter] you know because little when things are small they are more transparent 

418.22 421.50 B: ah by virtue of being small and ah 

421.64 423.79 B: (( they they use ah more )) 

424.11 425.43 B: consultants 

425.59 432.47 B: ah you know wi- without 'cause when everything is in house sometimes you you hide things 

432.27 433.68 A: exactly 

433.10 444.30 B: and ah you get away with you you start you try something small you get away with it and then it keeps going bigger because i seen this like you know personally at work and at some other places 

444.34 445.73 B: and people 

446.28 449.79 B: if their their tendency is to be that they ah 

450.31 461.79 B: they go bigger and bigger and more fr- and more fraud and they get away with it like i say they become invincible so they think and then it gets out of hand and then you have to continue i suppose [laughter] 

461.49 465.35 A: i guess it would go right back into slapping the hand that feeds you at that point 

465.29 473.46 A: because why would they want to go against the company that's giving them a pay cheque whereas if they had an independent contractor come in 

469.55 470.42 B: (( yes )) 

473.24 481.86 A: that had no real cost to the company that would feel freer to acknowledge when there was ah 

482.22 486.27 A: errors or misappropriations or whatever they feel 

485.26 486.75 B: i don't think 

486.77 492.08 B: i'm personally probably don't think they're errors i think somebody along the way 

492.20 496.17 B: ah maybe even hired somebody to do you know that would do the creative 

496.20 506.05 B: ah accounting but they want it you know the creative bookkeeping to hide things or to misrepresent things and 

499.45 500.25 A: yes 

504.44 510.26 A: and even if it and even if it was ended up being a legitimate error but no one went back and fixed it 

510.04 518.32 B: it's too big i think to be a legitimate maybe at the very beginning and then they hid it maybe you're right you know like you make a mistake and then you hide it because 

514.44 515.20 A: yes 

518.31 530.52 A: and then that turns into something bigger and it snowballs and then it's out of everybody's control and all they can do is just continually try to hide what started out small and grew larger and 

521.72 522.43 B: (( yes )) 

531.11 535.20 A: what i'm sorry what was the company name that was closed 

534.79 535.81 B: enron 

535.34 536.95 A: enron yeah they 

537.05 539.17 A: you know that one there that was just 

538.94 544.41 B: that one was bad [laughter] that was bad i wonder how widespread it is it's it's you know it ah 

539.21 540.23 A: total 

545.64 552.49 B: it would be ah more reassuring if it was just a couple of companies but it's it has become an accepted practice in that 

552.76 567.59 B: then we are having probl- you know it's i think it's ethical and it's morals and it goes like i say much deeper than just the companies it's obvious probably a reflection of our society and you need to get down to basic values of you know 

563.83 565.06 A: exactly 

567.72 569.49 B: family values and 

570.69 576.31 B: what the forefathers thought of you know if you look at the constitution and ah 

576.50 585.38 B: you know even the the the core with god trust does america what does it say god in god i trust 

585.00 585.94 A: yes 

585.50 591.27 B: you know it's at that time it sounded like they had very solid religious and moral values 

591.62 593.90 B: and i don't think that would have happened 

592.68 599.19 A: very much so and and back i want to think that back when they wrote the constitution and they got everything written down 

599.21 599.95 A: yet
