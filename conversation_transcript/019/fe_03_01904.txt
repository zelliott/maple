519.72 534.44 B: out in the school parking lot most of the time doing band camp and things like that but we go to every game and every performance whatever they do and that means a lot to 'em more than the little extra things they were getting when we were both you know working out 

534.22 535.86 B: school time and things 

536.64 547.15 B: but they have seemed to enjoy it more because i talk about maybe getting another part time job outside of the home and they're just no no because you've got to do this and do this 

546.89 548.13 A: [laughter] 

547.41 549.22 B: they want me there more than

556.38 568.11 B: they they're real good and i've been lucky they you know no trouble or anything and they're both active in church real well and you know it's just another blessing from god that i've got my family 

568.31 571.02 B: in church and they look to him too 

571.23 574.80 B: first and they're not often because there's so much here 

574.82 577.12 B: (( that they could be into and i just )) 

577.21 583.14 B: i'm lucky that they ain't you know like they come up with good morals and stuff so 

583.35 589.35 A: it's hard it really is hard to instill that in your kids i mean i live in a little town 

584.36 585.49 B: it is 

589.39 591.84 A: you blink your eye and you miss it 

591.50 593.76 B: that's right that's why where we're at
