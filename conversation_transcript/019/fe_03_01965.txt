0.45 2.66 B: hello i'm salina 

2.76 4.78 A: (( hi i'm phyllis [laughter] uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh )) 

4.31 5.26 B: (( hi [laughter] )) 

5.97 6.87 B: um 

8.02 10.13 B: i don't know i work for a corporation 

11.38 14.20 B: so um a large corporation 

15.28 16.87 B: (( so ah )) 

18.29 19.39 B: i guess 

21.20 22.51 B: i guess um 

22.58 24.59 B: what th- what they were talking about 

24.60 31.13 B: i mean you got you got all that that stuff at the top you know nobody like come down and talks to the indians 

31.35 35.55 B: and they make decisions that are i think eco- economically 

36.02 38.71 B: not um good for the company 

38.95 42.65 B: because they don't talk to the people that it directly affects 

43.24 44.82 B: you know they say um 

45.28 48.53 B: i watched a documentary like on walmart one time 

48.95 57.10 B: and it said that that's why he became so successful because he came down and talked to the little people 

57.90 62.30 B: and found out how they would you know better run the company 

62.67 63.62 B: so 

64.06 65.02 B: (( and ah )) 

65.85 67.48 B: 'cause you know 

68.56 72.11 B: all the bureaucracy that goes along with it you know 

72.44 76.11 B: hiring people because of who they are not because what they can do 

76.80 78.28 B: (( you know and ah )) 

78.35 79.27 B: pay 

80.37 86.00 B: you know the pay office and all that kind of stuff but it really goes on i think some people think it's like 

86.43 88.55 B: just but it really does go on 

89.34 91.01 B: so i don't know where do you work 

91.23 93.01 A: oh i just work at home 

92.96 95.82 B: okay well how about your husband 

95.15 97.86 A: ah he works for an elevator company 

97.13 97.78 B: (( okay )) 

98.88 101.95 B: okay so i don't know if he has got the same situation 

102.34 103.09 A: yeah 

102.43 104.26 B: you know how big the company is 

104.04 108.18 A: uh-huh yes he is about you are reminding me of 

108.20 114.74 A: him when you were talking there that's the way he would talk you know it's if he would have had this question put to him so 

115.24 116.16 B: yeah 

116.18 119.87 A: he he knows a lot more about it than i would and probably you do too 

120.22 131.87 A: so that's why i'm [laughter] you know you're inclined to have more to say about it than i would but i think you're right about that they should have the the smaller people you know the ones that are not as high up 

132.07 134.29 A: you know in some of the decisions 

135.09 135.91 B: right 

136.46 138.22 B: i'm in health care so yeah 

138.23 139.33 A: oh you are 

138.30 140.59 B: i'm with the big hospital 

140.43 141.35 A: oh 

141.44 143.84 B: so but i'm i'm a little guy 

143.63 144.46 A: uh-huh 

144.33 145.97 B: you you know what i'm saying 

146.13 153.00 B: and they make all the dec- decisions and and and things and no one like no one asked us what will work 

153.16 153.97 A: uh-huh 

153.93 157.78 B: and it it ends up sometimes making our job harder instead of easier 

159.21 161.01 B: and things like that and then 

161.12 166.20 B: you know the people that get put in like supervisor positions are like pay offs 

166.34 168.46 B: you know somebody's uncle or 

169.07 171.74 B: you you know and they're not like 

172.87 181.77 B: so i i just think that the little people should have more input and i'd rather see these big corporations hire from like within 

181.82 184.16 B: i think they would have more dedication 

184.42 188.77 B: and if somebody has worked for you for years and they prove to be an honest 

189.00 199.94 B: um person and and and they seem to have the company you know first in mind i think they would be better off giving them the job than some outside person you 

202.09 204.46 B: know and i guess your husband runs into the same thing 

205.21 207.24 B: i think it costs us a lot of money 

209.75 212.67 B: you know and government wise 

213.16 214.91 B: you know 'cause like they were saying you 

215.31 218.73 B: know employee theft is like a big thing you know 

219.78 221.85 B: you know people that work for 'em 

222.23 227.23 B: and taking things and i think in the long run that's why things are so expensive in you know 

228.51 229.29 B: (( ah )) 

229.88 231.45 B: and it makes it hard 

233.51 236.64 A: yeah i know where my husband works i know they would fire you if they catch you 

236.93 238.24 A: taking anything 

237.98 238.98 B: right 

239.38 242.03 A: so that i guess that cuts down a lot of the little 

243.96 252.15 B: yeah and then they don't stop and think about the big guys sitting up there at the desk though he's he's maneuvering the figures around with the thousands you know 

244.09 245.30 A: (( bits )) 

251.81 253.05 A: oh yeah [laughter] i 

252.57 254.07 B: to his benefit 

253.55 255.19 A: guess that's truly we're 

255.28 256.52 A: (( at huh you )) 

256.64 257.94 A: (( know i'm )) 

256.71 258.63 B: yeah he's doing it too 

259.55 262.08 B: because they don't have that corporate integrity 

262.94 264.75 B: you know filtering down 

264.88 267.42 B: you know they always say it starts at the top 

268.15 274.66 B: you know because if you've got integrity at the top then your employees will be integrity conscious 

275.17 277.67 B: but if the people at the top aren't 

277.71 279.48 B: then it doesn't come down 

280.19 283.07 B: you know if he if he is um 

284.60 285.58 B: you know 

285.76 293.82 B: um cheating on his expense account and doing all these these little underhanded things that they do at the top it it filters down 

294.20 296.40 B: and i think it just like 

297.50 303.60 B: where if they hired i think if they were a little more sometimes i think they look for too many credentials 

304.21 311.81 B: and they're not looking at the they are better off maybe with somebody that doesn't have as many degrees that ha- that is like more corporate 

312.48 322.58 B: that's been there a while that's had some dedication and has some integrity you know that that would be a better person to move up that the workers already respect 

322.94 323.87 B: (( you know )) 

324.18 328.73 B: (( but they don't do that i don't know about your husband do they bring people in from the outside who don't know anything )) 

329.18 332.18 B: or don't know anything as far as you know what you're doing 

333.27 338.15 B: they just graduated from got an extra degree at college or something 

338.17 344.83 A: not sure if they do that but they may i'll have to ask him tonight i know they move them all around to different locations too 

341.84 342.66 B: (( yes )) 

344.95 345.90 B: uh-huh 

346.47 359.36 B: and that's the biggest complaint we just had a an employee survey at the hospital and one of the biggest complaints there is they bring people in from the outside put 'em in a supervisor position and they don't even know what they are doing 

360.56 364.04 B: so the little guy ends up training their supervisor 

366.95 371.39 B: but see the people they bring in from the outside got degrees and all 

372.35 376.98 B: they may be the girl that has been working there for ten years that knows what she is doing 

377.03 385.59 B: doesn't have like a four year degree from college maybe she only has a two year or has a high school but she has got more on the ball 

385.88 387.51 B: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

386.79 388.64 A: yeah 

388.05 391.30 B: than the college graduate they just brought in [laughter] 

392.36 393.93 B: as far as the job goes 

395.04 398.17 B: so that that's one of the biggest complaints i know we have 

399.25 400.89 B: (( because they are always trying to )) 

401.59 404.96 B: change things for the better but they seem to make it worse 

406.30 408.12 B: and the morale goes down 

410.96 414.30 B: and it's that big corporation thing that goes on 

415.63 417.89 B: this is the second one i've worked for 

418.87 420.73 B: and it doesn't change 

421.62 423.30 B: it it seems like 

423.94 425.31 B: you know go 

426.33 428.29 B: on from one to the other 

428.96 431.16 B: i mean there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of 

431.41 433.28 B: not in health care anyway 

434.34 435.48 B: yeah 

434.95 438.98 A: yeah my daughter is just studying she wants to do that type work 

439.22 441.62 A: with the coding and things like that different training 

440.87 441.79 B: uh-huh 

442.55 445.02 B: yeah well she will find the same thing will happen 

445.65 448.54 B: you know her she will end up training her boss 

449.58 452.12 B: [laughter] 

452.66 454.20 B: and and it's 

454.45 456.20 B: it's just not right 

457.12 457.79 B: (( so )) 

460.34 461.20 B: (( well )) 

461.57 462.71 B: (( i don't know )) 

464.18 469.07 B: um how many ah is she in college or is she taking a class or 

468.23 471.01 A: [laughter] all right yeah she's taking a she's in a business school 

471.03 471.90 B: (( yes )) 

472.45 474.62 A: i i guess it's a nine month program 

474.97 479.78 A: she wants to do medi care forms and i guess it's coding and things like that you know 

479.25 480.84 B: it's all numbers 

480.30 488.05 A: yeah first yeah she's on that part right now learning that she has had a little hard but she's doing real well i hope 

481.71 482.64 B: mhm

488.70 490.49 A: she can get a good job 

491.09 494.06 B: yeah the the courters get paid pretty good

496.53 497.68 B: (( i mean you know )) 

497.99 502.74 B: to me i i i i would probably get bored sitting there doing those numbers all day

536.93 540.35 B: (( big corporation thing goes on at all levels ))
