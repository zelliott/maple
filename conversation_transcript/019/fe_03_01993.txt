99.85 101.67 A: i started ah 

101.97 109.88 A: just ah maybe six months ago having the deduction taken out on a weekly basis of buying a savings bond 

109.93 116.13 A: the ah federal government goes right into your checking account and i buy a twenty five dollar bond every friday 

116.21 123.46 A: and i figure i'm i'm thinking of even upping that to maybe buying a fifty dollar one every friday and 

122.70 131.10 B: do you want the government you let the government go into your checking account i'd be afraid that they'd take more than you wanted 'em to take [laughter] oh 

130.25 140.13 A: well in this day and age you know you you check it every day and ah you know it's all there computerized and anybody who takes it out you know you got it documented that they took 

140.27 145.74 A: you know two they hit you for two bonds but they give you the serial number right away and 

145.47 147.11 B: well that's good 

146.54 164.33 A: and this and that and i just feel that's safer than the stock market i mean you know it's going to double in seven years or ten years and and ah you know the the way the stock market's going and you know you hear more and more of people who have i was talking to my father in law last year and he says he took a sixty 

154.14 155.33 B: that's true 

164.34 174.86 A: thousand dollar hit in the last three years and he wants to buy a new car and he was planning on it but he's retired and he doesn't think he can afford it now and you know 

173.49 181.79 B: no mine mine wasn't that bad mine was only a couple of thousand every quarter but it was enough to hurt me 

176.10 178.10 A: yeah and well you know 

181.75 183.93 A: yeah and yeah i 

183.05 188.79 B: because i'm thirty seven and i've been putting in since i was twenty eight so that's like nine years 

188.45 194.93 A: yeah but i don't trust 'em anyway as i think they're all politicians and they don't they all 

195.30 204.96 A: they make their little deals before and you know the the big guys know who's selling what or what company's going to do what before 

204.08 206.26 B: oh the insider trading like 

205.20 209.99 A: the insider trading every you know that it's been going on for years 

208.90 213.26 B: oh that's illegal you don't think that goes on do you [laughter] 

211.57 225.86 A: oh for cry- i mean you might get somebody else that they catch you know and they you know how many do they catch and how many do get away with it in you know so they is it the story that they catch one but they didn't catch the other fifteen 

219.92 220.81 B: yeah 

226.00 226.98 A: you know 

226.25 232.27 B: well we used to say about enron earlier they were building that huge power plant out in one of our um 

232.31 236.35 B: rural areas um over the last two years and 

236.29 244.87 B: we didn't know enron was one of the major in it and when all that blew up now we have like sitting on like a sixty acre field 

244.75 255.02 B: obvious electrical big you know and and you know those big things they have for um that they conduct the electricity through and everything 

254.68 255.70 A: right 

255.09 260.48 B: sitting out there and they're rusting because when they went belly up 

260.47 262.47 B: it just left out there 

262.40 276.76 B: and a lot of people lost their jobs at you know when they first brought it in it was going to be this real great thing you know and it was going to bring a lot of jobs to the area and and now you just drive by and it's all still fenced up and the fences are locked and the gates are locked and 

276.70 289.22 B: and it's just sitting there resting and you can just imagine how much money's sitting out there it seems like somebody could take it and at least sell what's out there and make some money back for the the shareholders that lost so much 

288.95 291.26 A: (( oh yeah yeah )) 

289.81 295.17 B: yeah but it's just it's sitting there and if it sits much longer it's going to be just wasted 

291.69 293.45 A: you read the stories 

294.55 299.35 A: and the people who got ruined the average you know mom and dad who 

299.63 314.06 A: who were advised or whatever and you know they thought they were going to be able to retire and do six months in florida and six months here or something and not live like kings but you know enjoy themselves then you know sixty five year old people have got to go back to work 

306.64 308.15 B: oh yeah 

314.03 315.49 A: (( because ah )) 

315.54 318.30 A: you know the games they played and ah 

317.62 328.16 B: well see what they could take place at and you know if there's one here there's probably several around the country why can't they sell that stuff that's sitting out there and there's they're just literally rotting 

322.72 324.28 A: oh more than that 

328.18 332.09 B: and try to recoup some money for these people that lost all their money 

331.66 332.72 A: (( yeah )) 

332.17 343.10 B: i've wondered that i don't know how many times it seems like the courts would have you know taken possession over some of that and try to have sold it because you know there's stuff out there that other electrical companies could use 

337.90 338.81 A: yeah 

342.78 355.71 A: and all these people who were smart enough they they hid the money and they you know the big shots and they donate to the politicians and who's running for this and that and the old story that the big guys you 

355.71 362.66 A: know would you go to jail for five years and but you know you got fifty million in some swiss account somewhere 

362.53 369.76 B: yeah and because it's it's in another country's account you know they don't have to give it back and that's not right 

362.98 364.49 A: (( you know )) 

368.53 374.51 A: yeah it's under their kid's name or it's under something and they you know they can't touch it or 

374.43 388.75 A: you know it's just a whole big game and a mess and i i just don't trust any of 'em and you know financial advisors this is i think they're just throwing sand in the wind too and just throwing it up and who knows what's going to happen every day 

388.88 390.72 A: you know i don't even 

390.88 394.51 A: i like you say i try to listen to what the market did 

394.92 405.80 A: but you know one day it's you know it goes up seventeen twelve thirty and then boom you get whacked for a hundred and fifty and but it's it's really hurting a lot of people 

405.61 407.64 B: it is it really has 

407.37 415.87 A: and you know the i don't know what the answer is you know my father used to tell me growing up you can never go wrong with real estate i wish i listened to him 

416.21 420.78 B: well but you can too have you not heard about that poor woman in texas 

420.74 432.13 B: she she was a nurse somewhere up in oklahoma somewhere saved for years and bought a piece of land down there in texas they were paying she was going to build her house there and retire 

431.97 437.81 B: well the e._p._a. have confiscated this land because they found a bug 

437.96 446.88 B: on it that has never been found anywhere else and now they've got this rights of of protection on this land because of this little bug 

438.05 438.83 A: oh 

446.94 459.72 B: and she can't build on it and she can't sell it because they're making it into a a preserve for that bug and she got screwed out of all of it she can't sell it the government won't pay her for it it has just been taken 

460.13 465.75 B: and here she has tak- saved for years and she is i've seen her on t._v. two or three times and 

466.03 475.80 B: ah the last time i seen her was a couple of months ago but she was you know talking about she can't even recoup any of her investment because you know the e._p._a. has taken it as 

475.86 476.68 B: (( you know )) 

476.28 480.63 A: (( yeah the intimate domain or whatever )) 

477.02 477.75 B: this 

477.92 478.99 B: (( bug )) 

480.18 481.51 B: and you know 

481.83 483.35 A: you can't win these 

482.21 487.41 B: the people suggested her you know if you burn it the bug's gone 

487.26 488.88 A: (( right )) 

487.85 501.76 B: you know maybe you can at least use it then and she said no then they'll put me in jail for it and that's not right so i mean real estate's not always the best way to go either because that'd be me i'd save forever and buy a piece of land and have some weird little bug nobody has ever seen before 

491.80 492.95 A: yeah 

502.03 503.71 B: and not be able to use it 

502.05 507.61 A: yeah so where which way do you turn do you invest i mean you've got to invest this day and age 

507.68 514.87 A: but you know do you it's even hard enough to scrimp enough to invest in anything be it a stock or so 

514.85 518.92 A: so i figure that at least buying a bond every week i'm doing something 

518.66 520.28 B: yeah that's true 

518.88 532.80 A: and and trying to save something and you know at least the government backs that and i'm not taking some c._e._o. of some board who is you know i don't 

532.76 534.60 A: know who knows 

534.13 535.70 B: [laughter] 

534.95 547.76 A: but you know and every day you get something in the mail from this financial or you know every time on the t._v. you get these commercials of prudentials or let us let us help you in 

547.98 559.75 A: you know every ever- it seems like every other commercial's somebody you know american express financial advisors or these financial advisors 

558.62 559.44 B: (( or )) 

560.18 561.64 A: (( yeah every )) 

561.15 562.76 B: counselling and 

562.04 564.76 A: yeah yeah and you pick up 

563.45 566.54 B: and you know those are just as bad as if you file bankruptcy 

566.90 568.42 A: it's what 

567.88 574.87 B: um if you go to one of those 'cause you are overloaded with bills and all it's just like if you file bankruptcy 

570.13 571.04 A: yeah 

572.16 572.94 A: yeah 

574.72 575.61 A: yeah 

574.89 581.29 B: because ah they call your creditors and actually tell them that you can't pay the higher price you know 

581.48 593.40 B: payments and everything and they ah the creditors end up revoking your cars they cut your interest down so you will pay part of it and because some of the people at work were talking about it and 

593.37 597.76 B: they said that it's just like um if you file bankruptcy in the first place 

597.98 599.89 A: so you're you're you're behind the eight
