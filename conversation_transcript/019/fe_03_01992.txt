21.53 25.94 B: um could you adjust the topic and everything 'cause i'm not 

24.70 26.73 A: yes i guess um 

27.42 29.30 A: the topic is 

29.59 33.04 A: as i understand it what corporate um 

33.43 36.80 A: misdee- meeds misdeeds have done 

36.85 38.74 A: to affect us right 

38.29 39.25 B: mhm 

39.44 40.51 A: um 

40.96 41.96 A: well 

43.06 51.87 A: i guess i would have to say that it is costing ah us in various ways because 

52.07 52.85 A: of 

52.92 54.25 A: (( the enron )) 

54.56 59.07 A: and there's i think there's a whole lot more of that going on 

59.17 61.11 A: than what we even know 

61.11 62.19 B: mhm 

61.55 64.58 A: and um 

65.16 68.90 A: we're actually all paying for it probably in higher taxes 

68.67 71.16 B: yeah that's one thing i don't like [laughter] 

70.61 71.91 A: me either 

72.31 74.29 A: and so what do you think 

74.55 75.49 B: well 

75.60 76.54 B: um 

76.93 81.05 B: i guess pretty much the same stuff but um 

81.88 83.93 B: so is it basically just like what 

83.98 84.95 B: um 

86.51 88.22 B: what are like the misdeeds though 

88.55 93.36 A: well what they were doing is they were um 

93.40 95.26 A: giving um 

95.66 107.06 A: like false information to investors showing that the company was [mn] it's not just enron there's other big corporations are doing the same thing where they're showing um 

105.07 105.94 B: mhm 

107.15 111.78 A: false information on their books to make their stock value look higher 

111.51 112.78 B: oh yeah 

111.87 119.13 A: so then the investors bought the stock bought stock based on information that they were given which was false 

119.18 121.85 A: and a lot of people have lost their money 

121.79 122.73 B: mhm 

121.89 127.37 A: a lot of people are being affected by this because they had their pension money 

127.39 128.46 A: (( in )) 

128.61 130.68 A: um stock with 

131.08 142.01 A: those corporations that have done some of this so a lot of people are going to be affected because they're going to have to work longer than they planned 

142.04 145.15 A: um 'cause their retirement money is gone 

145.22 146.15 B: mhm 

146.50 152.25 A: so that's one nother way that it's going to be affected and 

152.32 153.12 A: (( ah )) 

153.14 156.40 A: actually i mean that's the way uh people are going to be affected 

156.08 157.44 B: yeah 

156.72 157.87 A: um 

158.40 161.72 B: well what do you think the government can do to fix 

161.01 168.78 A: well for one thing i think the government needs to make an example of those executives that were responsible 

168.78 169.65 B: mhm 

169.45 171.10 A: and i think 

172.51 175.71 A: that they should get really big prison terms 

175.74 180.36 A: and i think that their assets should be seized so that other executives 

180.51 181.53 A: um 

181.60 183.20 A: in other companies 

184.37 185.26 A: um 

186.27 197.51 A: are warned that they can't do this and get away with it because a lot of those guys got not only when they were ready to close up um they walked out with gigantic big bonuses 

188.99 189.92 B: mhm 

197.79 198.68 B: right 

197.83 201.01 A: like millions and millions of dollars in bonuses 

200.34 202.06 B: but they really don't deserve it 

202.15 208.02 A: mhm that sh- no that should have gone to the stockholders and to the back into that company 

202.92 203.78 B: yeah 

208.40 209.23 A: so 

208.58 209.39 B: mhm 

210.12 211.10 A: anyway 

210.97 215.26 B: yeah i think they go make tougher laws so you know 

214.45 215.17 A: yes 

215.57 216.46 A: mhm 

215.59 217.57 B: (( i don't know [laughter] )) 

216.74 217.92 A: yes yes 

218.01 220.90 A: yeah i agree um 

221.66 223.36 A: (( although )) 

223.72 227.63 A: i don't know um if making more laws is going to 

227.75 229.04 A: do it because 

229.22 232.67 A: what these people did was illegal anyway 

232.51 235.53 B: i suppose doing it all behind their backs and stuff 

234.86 236.58 A: right mhm 

235.62 236.61 B: yeah 

236.76 237.78 A: yeah 

237.96 239.52 A: (( and )) 

239.63 240.62 A: (( let's see )) 

240.34 243.07 B: did they get like punished or anything or you don't know 

242.33 245.96 A: well i don't think so far i um uh 

244.53 245.30 B: (( uh-huh )) 

246.00 251.29 A: they're all under a lot of these guys are under indictment and but um 

252.97 255.37 A: (( um what was i going to say )) 

255.89 257.02 A: um 

257.56 264.57 A: there's a l- there's a whole lot more [mn] out there [mn] in other big companies that hasn't even come to light i'm sure 

264.82 272.01 A: because enron and these other companies that have been caught recently um that went under um 

269.61 270.38 B: mhm 

273.99 279.75 A: there's other ones that have been doing the same thing because there were people on 

279.79 285.72 A: enron's board of directors that are also on other big gigantic major corporations in the united states 

286.17 286.95 A: so 

286.26 287.16 B: mhm 

287.37 288.26 A: um 

288.75 294.20 A: but the main thing is they want to know why we think that's going to affect people 

294.51 296.43 A: um what do you think 

296.92 299.22 A: when big companies go under 

299.23 301.00 A: because of um 

301.37 303.47 A: or big companies do 

303.77 304.66 A: um 

304.82 309.07 A: illegal or fraudulent things how do you think that it affects 

309.09 309.91 A: you 

310.29 311.99 B: well it um 

313.27 319.61 B: well it doesn't it like make us pay more well first of all tax money and stuff so we're 

319.73 320.87 A: mhm 

320.33 322.33 B: we lose our money by doing that 

321.94 322.95 A: mhm 

322.70 324.40 B: and um 

325.45 326.98 B: well i don't really know 

326.90 327.86 A: mhm 

327.58 329.91 B: 'cause i'm only in ninth grade and everything so 

329.34 330.82 A: you're in ninth grade 

330.22 331.63 B: yeah [laughter] 

331.22 332.96 A: i kind of thought so 

332.33 333.48 B: [laughter] 

334.47 335.48 B: it's kind of 

334.60 335.42 A: um 

335.69 340.69 A: yeah um well what you ah let's see how can i 

341.62 343.52 A: (( say um )) 

344.41 352.02 A: what else are we supposed to there was another topic on there that we were supposed to talk about um do you remember what it was 

352.45 356.05 B: um no not really well because my mom gave it to me [sigh] 

355.69 357.11 A: oh your mom gave it to you 

356.68 358.62 B: yeah right but i'm supposed to talk to you 

358.36 360.12 A: oh [laughter] 

359.49 361.79 B: well she did write something down about this though 

361.94 366.59 B: so that's all like sorry no some of this stuff is she said well it said that um 

366.82 370.19 B: they could also like the government they can audit 

368.72 369.45 A: uh-huh 

370.71 373.62 B: by outside agencies to help honesty 

373.61 375.85 A: oh right that's a good idea 

375.53 376.70 B: yeah 

376.72 380.94 A: yeah um but um they had um 

381.42 387.29 A: um big acc- they had big accounting firms that also went went under because of this because 

387.32 392.82 A: they participated and allowed allowed didn't actually 

392.96 397.95 A: present they knew that the information that they were putting out was was was fraudulent 

397.84 398.75 B: mhm 

398.11 401.57 A: ah what was it young i forgot i forgot who it was 

401.84 402.90 A: um 

403.25 404.95 A: arthur young was it 

404.74 405.97 B: (( i don't know [laughter] )) 

406.76 407.55 A: (( mm )) 

407.11 413.12 B: could be i i've heard of enron and stuff but i didn't really keep up much with what they do 

409.27 410.25 A: mhm 

411.46 412.59 A: mhm 

412.96 413.99 A: mhm 

414.30 415.17 B: but 

414.55 418.09 A: so um you're in minnesota and you're in the ninth grade 

417.63 419.04 B: yeah 

418.78 419.77 A: (( oh )) 

420.06 420.98 B: (( so so )) 

420.35 422.36 A: okay um 

422.49 425.50 B: is it like but wasn't it sort of like a computer thing 

425.45 426.31 A: what 

425.95 427.45 B: en- like enron 

427.54 432.07 A: no it was a they were i think they were like um 

427.55 428.51 B: like they were 

433.12 435.73 A: it had something to do with um energy 

435.70 438.28 B: (( oh i don't know [laughter] )) 

437.94 444.04 A: but anyway they're not the only ones that did this also um let's see what else could the government do 

440.62 441.56 B: mhm 

444.99 446.12 A: um 

447.75 449.88 A: basically they're going to have to 

450.55 453.48 A: find these people who were in charge 

454.14 456.19 A: and um 

456.60 459.37 A: all do prison terms because otherwise 

460.03 460.85 A: when 

461.04 465.13 A: they see that they can get away with this kind of stuff it'll just continue 

465.13 466.12 B: mhm 

466.75 467.87 A: um 

467.44 469.77 B: i think we should just get rid of all of them [laughter] 

469.53 470.91 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

470.28 472.35 B: somehow i don't know though 

471.33 472.12 A: (( yes )) 

472.52 473.42 A: yeah 

473.66 475.20 A: but um 

476.10 477.43 A: let's see 

477.47 480.60 A: so did they teach tell you anything about this in school 

480.72 482.62 B: not much 

482.36 483.21 A: no 

482.74 485.39 B: well 'cause like in history we're learning about geography so 

485.36 486.35 A: the what 

486.06 487.25 B: geography 

487.26 488.20 A: oh 

487.78 490.50 B: so it's not really on this type of topic 

490.20 491.14 A: oh 

491.82 496.82 A: okay well when they when they originally called they had a different topic and then 

491.84 492.61 B: but 

497.15 499.86 A: somehow they they it got changed to 

500.49 502.90 A: ah corporate um 

504.48 505.46 A: um 

507.44 508.89 A: fraud and whatever 

508.69 511.03 B: mhm that's kind of weird 

510.83 511.70 A: mhm 

512.32 514.43 B: but you don't remember what the other topic was 

514.23 517.75 A: well it had to do with that also but i can't remember i should have wr- 

516.80 518.28 B: oh [laughter] 

517.77 521.67 A: and the recording talks rather fast so i couldn't um 

522.14 524.11 A: it wasn't clear to me 

523.90 524.91 B: mhm 

525.15 526.13 A: um 

526.80 527.83 A: (( let's see )) 

528.10 528.90 A: gee 

528.93 531.76 A: ten minutes goes seems like a long time doesn't it 

531.25 533.60 B: i know [laughter] [laughter] it does 

531.81 533.15 A: [laughter] 

534.78 535.93 A: um 

535.51 538.23 B: especially when you have to stay on like this topic you know 

537.66 540.93 A: y- yeah um what time is it there 

541.34 544.86 B: it's um six twelve 

544.52 546.35 A: oh it's only one ten here 

546.27 547.50 B: oh really wow 

547.52 548.27 A: (( yeah )) 

548.36 550.38 A: yeah um 

549.46 550.45 B: that's kind of 

551.22 552.58 A: what was your name again 

552.30 553.29 B: maria 

552.94 554.86 A: maria i'm susan i- i'm

556.01 557.11 B: that's okay 

556.90 557.92 A: it's okay 

558.15 559.95 A: so um 

560.55 565.51 A: let's see what else could we say about the fact that how this is going to affect 

566.36 567.55 A: well 

569.73 573.63 A: it affects the stock market because people are afraid to invest now 

573.43 574.41 B: yeah 

573.76 578.91 A: in addition to the stock market going down down down down this added to the 

579.55 580.60 A: to the 

580.93 581.88 A: (( um )) 

582.65 584.52 A: lack of confidence 

585.13 586.15 B: mhm 

585.19 586.04 A: (( 'cause )) 

586.38 588.36 B: and i think that you know 

586.78 587.35 A: (( [mn] )) 

588.72 592.50 B: once like if they get away with what they're doing now 

592.20 593.16 A: mhm 

592.69 596.63 B: you know then more people are going to be like oh well we can do this 

596.70 599.89 B: like people like my age and stuff they're going to be oh well we can do this and get 

598.49 599.51 A: (( mhm ))
