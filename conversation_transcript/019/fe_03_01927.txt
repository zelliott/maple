231.72 233.40 B: right 

233.62 234.66 B: (( right exac- )) 

234.74 236.89 B: (( exactly maybe it is girls )) 

236.57 238.53 A: i think it's a girl thing 

237.14 238.18 B: [laughter] 

238.60 245.15 A: but i'll tell you what even at eleven months she was already when she wants it she wants it now and if she doesn't get it 

245.19 249.26 A: so she is just gosh she's so much fun 

248.89 250.38 B: (( [sigh] oh )) 

249.24 260.34 A: i forget how much fun they are at this age and everything's so new i think that's what's so wonderful is you know she'll sit there and just concentrate and concentrate wish my boys would do the same things with school 

253.09 254.30 B: right 

255.68 257.25 B: [noise] 

259.39 262.03 B: [laughter] concentrate right 

260.55 268.55 A: you know concentrate that hard to get it accomplished until she does it and she'll just keep working on it it's like standing up 

262.82 264.15 B: right 

267.99 269.30 B: wow 

268.70 276.07 A: and so i mean that's what i think the big thing though that we do as as a family is make sure that we eat together 

275.50 276.83 B: right yes 

276.36 280.87 A: it's like there's no options and that's the thing i remember growing up as we get older 

280.91 285.23 A: sunday nights you ate with the family you had to be dead at the morgue 

284.80 286.60 B: [laughter] 

285.10 292.06 A: to not be at the dinner table on sunday nights that was just that was all there was to it so 

290.69 291.73 B: right 

291.89 300.29 A: and i think that's a really neat thing to have with the family to be able to sit down and say you know i ate cause you can find out so much with that 

299.65 304.24 B: that's true an- and that's how we are as you say growing up 

304.60 308.78 B: sunday dinner was always the big dinner you know it was always this 

308.97 321.55 B: the biggest meal of the week was always sunday dinner and all you always had desert and every thing else and um an- and so yeah we still and there even today there are certain things 

311.59 312.30 A: (( mm )) 

321.59 322.47 B: you just 

322.59 333.06 B: don't be late with the sunday dinner you know it's like i remember one night it was one sunday we were really busy and i made spaghetti for dinner my mother happened to call 

325.36 326.46 A: (( yeah )) 

333.17 343.36 B: and i said oh we're in the middle of dinner wh- what are you having oh spaghetti on sunday [laughter] it was like how dare you have spaghetti on a sunday 

338.87 339.74 A: yep 

343.08 347.05 A: oh yeah you have to have meat potatoes vegetables and fruit 

344.74 348.20 B: exactly exactly 

347.20 351.24 A: chocolate milk and you know home made apple pie 

348.27 349.95 B: [laughter] 

350.52 352.34 B: (( yeah oh of course )) 

352.32 361.51 A: oh yeah well and that's what i mean that's just how it was growing up and i this is some of the neatest times that i remember that you know mum and dad always made sure they were home 

355.42 356.49 B: right 

360.98 362.08 B: right 

361.45 368.35 A: you know my brother and i could bring home friends or whatever on sunday night but our buts were sitting on that table on sunday night 

364.31 365.90 B: mhm 

366.85 369.12 B: right exactly 

368.27 378.11 A: and that's pretty much the kids the only thing i just that kind of bothers me now is that our church for our youth group do a sunday night dinner 

377.76 378.83 B: oh 

378.17 390.78 A: and so that kind of gets difficult sometimes because but you know i'm like that's fine if you guys want to go but you can't you still have to come and sit at the [noise] dinner table [noise] with us [noise] 

381.41 383.04 B: right 

390.19 392.20 B: right that's true 

390.71 401.69 A: [noise] and the kids don't always [noise] i mean they're kind of [noise] like i want to go play game boy i wanna [noise] go do this it's like no you know you will sit down here and you will enjoy this [noise] 

398.66 400.20 B: [noise] 

400.76 412.83 B: [cough] exactly cause i mean i remember y- i remember my mother getting up on sunday morning and putting the roast in the oven before we went to church and setting the oven and you know the whole 

410.13 411.05 A: (( and )) 

412.78 416.23 B: the whole thing so it is i think that it is really important 

416.14 427.35 A: so i mean if there's i to me if there [noise] is nothing else that i can give to my kids to go on [noise] it's t- to you know remember that you know is family is the core 

426.82 428.15 B: right 

427.67 439.62 A: and you know no matter what else happens i could be furious with my mother but you know what i still know mums going to be there i want my kids to do the same thing i want them to know you know the families the core 

430.00 430.84 B: that's 

434.50 435.57 B: right 

436.80 437.80 B: right 

439.08 440.19 B: right 

439.59 445.33 A: no matter [noise] what else is going on you can always count on the family to be there [noise] 

443.70 449.27 B: exactly exactly and always come back home you know and 

445.39 446.37 A: [noise] 

449.65 453.66 B: [sigh] an- and i think that's what we try to instill that you know 

454.06 462.65 B: it's great to have friends and it's you know um work we're happy that you make these these wonderful friends but 

463.15 467.69 B: as you said the family is is the core and you know 

467.67 478.47 B: lauren is always going to be ajay's sister no matter what happens you know and um and i think right now of course they're very young so they get along 

478.49 485.89 B: pretty well for siblings of this age [cough] and i just hope that it continues as they get older 

484.20 485.23 A: but see
