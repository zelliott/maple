109.07 117.87 B: at this point i'm like thirty five and i haven't had children so i'm not thinking that i really want any if if i do i can change my mind and adopt i guess 

117.66 120.80 A: oh well actually i'm looking into that i'm doing research 

120.64 121.83 B: for adoption 

121.51 122.31 A: yes 

121.90 123.32 B: are you really 

122.70 124.79 A: uh-huh and i'm quite a bit older than you 

124.48 125.39 B: oh 

125.41 127.05 B: that's exciting 

126.60 130.77 A: yeah i'm kind of scared because i don't have a family support system 

130.42 131.41 B: mhm 

130.82 132.53 A: and if i do this 

133.20 135.14 A: it it's going to be all on me 

135.62 139.43 B: wow but i've i've known people who've done that on their own mhm 

139.06 144.23 A: well i've met some people who have but ah the people who who um 

144.21 156.30 A: have done it the single women who i know that i've met briefly um they have support systems they have aunts or or cousins or sisters or mothers or somebody helping them out in the same city 

156.01 157.09 B: wow 

156.50 159.04 A: and i know i won't have that support system 

158.98 162.59 B: do you have really good friends that you're really close to 

160.88 164.45 A: well yeah but that doesn't mean that they're going to 

164.04 165.20 B: well yeah 

164.58 168.94 A: you know they don't live close enough to just drop over i do have one neighbor 

168.63 169.53 B: uh-huh 

169.11 172.24 A: it's my best friend but um 

170.59 171.60 B: mhm 

172.50 182.02 A: i mean if i take it on i can't i can probably depend on him sometimes but not a whole lot because you're taking this on you're you're asking for this 

181.52 182.81 B: yeah 

182.20 183.96 A: you're choosing this 

183.83 184.90 B: wow 

184.26 189.32 A: so um i could probably depend on him on in an emergency but 

188.73 191.61 B: so mostly and you work full time and everything 

191.11 203.44 A: yes but um as it is now i'm close to kind of retirement that i can get out of my ah i have like a half a dozen jobs i can get out of my main job 

203.50 205.78 A: um and and not too long 

205.59 206.94 B: oh wow 

206.36 217.38 A: and if i coincide the adoption then i'll have to put the kid in day care maybe for a couple of years and then i can be a halfway full time mom 

217.09 218.60 B: oh that's cool 

218.19 221.28 A: so i'm i'm not sure about that i'm not 

221.30 227.69 A: i mean i i think i do want to adopt and i've been thinking about it for a long time and doing research but really not 

227.71 229.10 A: doing anything 

228.88 230.55 B: yeah are you wanting like 

229.39 235.56 A: you know you do research and you get ah caught in the research and not the actual doing 

235.18 236.66 B: yeah 

236.12 241.03 A: and right now the cheapest i find i've found is sixteen thousand 

240.40 241.41 B: wow 

241.30 242.33 A: so i was 

241.49 246.09 B: are you wanting to adopt like ah an american child or a foreign child 

244.48 248.69 A: no no i don't want to do american because they take 'em back 

248.39 249.52 B: wow 

249.52 250.73 A: (( they have made )) 

249.79 261.11 B: such a good opportunity for for a child from a poor country to be able to be raised you know the united states is so wealthy when you look at the global view of things you know mhm 

260.52 261.43 A: yes 

261.39 275.62 A: well the ah the foreign adoptions are very expensive because we have to travel to that country and do all the legal and social work you do the social work here in this country and you have to travel to that country and do all the legal work there 

275.43 276.41 B: wow 

276.65 286.00 A: and so that's very expensive and ah the the money worries me right now 'cause i don't have that in in bulk that means you have to take out some kinda loan 

281.32 282.18 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

287.01 295.81 A: so um but that is an option and there are single women doing it you know i never made at these i've i've gone to like three seminars 

295.43 296.33 B: mhm 

296.03 298.50 A: and i never meet single men 

298.76 299.62 B: (( right )) 

299.03 300.54 A: wanting to adopt 

300.21 301.24 B: really 

301.13 302.57 A: no and 

301.99 303.10 B: that's odd 

303.04 306.58 A: you know i don't know i i don't think the men 

306.95 310.46 A: ah as a as a whole in society are that 

310.79 313.49 A: ah i don't know they're just not doing it 

313.36 315.36 B: well that that's interesting 

315.37 317.36 A: the women are but not the men 

317.54 321.40 B: oh you know women i guess tend to be more nurturing or yeah 

320.64 326.08 A: yes and they're not ah the men are not developing 'cause i see single women 

326.13 332.11 A: and their hu- their boyfriends leave 'em when they get pregnant so where is the nurturing for their own flesh and blood 

331.80 333.21 B: yeah that's true 

332.75 337.75 A: and there's a lot of divorced people who aren't getting the child support from the men 

337.39 338.57 B: mhm 

337.76 339.54 A: again where's the nurturing 

339.35 340.25 B: right 

340.43 343.68 A: so i'm not getting that but um 

343.70 349.66 A: yeah that is an option for you if you decide to do that though you are still young enough to get pregnant 

350.80 355.49 B: mm yeah i don't know that i'd make a good parent that that's what's always scared me 

355.32 360.78 A: well you know the thing about it is in in our time the the time we're living in 

360.37 361.26 B: mhm 

361.22 364.49 A: you don't have to do either if you don't want to 

364.66 367.83 A: you don't have to be a parent it's not like the old days 

367.38 369.09 B: where where you yeah 

368.84 371.95 A: where society said you had to they gave you 

372.09 374.30 A: a a certain limitation 

374.04 375.06 B: mhm 

374.36 378.01 A: but now you live in such a good time span 

378.13 380.72 A: that if you don't want to you don't have to 

380.60 381.63 B: yeah 

381.86 383.70 B: that's that's very true 

385.54 393.26 B: um living in the south is a lot more conservative than where i grew up too where at my age being single here is considered very odd 

393.44 394.36 A: yes 

394.33 398.81 B: you know back home it it wouldn't be as noticeable or or something but 

399.10 400.19 B: i'll get that 

400.41 405.54 B: oh you poor thing somebody will find you [laughter] it's like well i'm not really looking but 

405.68 409.98 B: you know for somebody to assume or make that presumption it's kind of odd 

410.07 412.82 A: yes i i get that a lot 

412.25 413.25 B: mhm 

413.02 418.00 A: and i just tell 'em look i'm not doing a good job of finding a mate then you do it 

417.83 418.74 B: right 

418.73 423.08 A: and i just give it to them now my circumstances is that i'm an artist 

423.41 426.18 A: and i live in a gay kind of world 

425.78 426.82 B: yeah 

426.23 427.84 A: and that's all i meet 

427.67 428.57 B: yeah 

429.00 429.83 B: well 

429.95 438.05 B: to to me my friends mean more to me than my family because my friends have been there for me in ways that my family never was 

437.40 439.48 A: well the same here 

439.05 441.91 B: and so to me that that is my family 

441.59 446.59 A: okay then you're saying that family is not flesh and blood you're saying it's relationship 

446.01 448.37 B: yes very much so 

448.01 448.98 A: okay 

448.61 450.34 B: but yeah 

450.65 452.94 B: i would say that i truly believe that 

452.33 453.32 A: yeah 

452.96 454.00 B: because 

454.11 461.06 B: my friends and i are very close and we've been friends for years and years and i can talk to them and 

461.28 463.04 B: rely on them more 

463.19 468.88 B: and plus i know that they care about me because they want to not because they're related to me and feel an obligation 

469.50 470.87 B: and and that's 

470.89 473.65 B: that's a special gift to have somebody who 

473.86 477.95 B: wants your friendship and cares about you because they just want to 

477.74 478.73 A: yeah 

478.36 479.50 B: you know what i mean 

479.09 479.97 A: yeah 

480.44 482.10 B: what kind of artist are you 

481.94 487.27 A: well right now um i do several kinds of art but my my main job 

487.36 494.57 A: is um yellow pages um the artist that does it um in the texas region so dallas houston san antonio austin 

491.08 491.91 B: oh like 

493.74 496.26 B: graphic artist oh 

494.86 502.90 A: yes it's computer art so when you open up the yellow pages from a to z somebody has to design all those ads 

496.39 498.02 B: oh well that's cool mhm 

502.42 506.37 B: see i work for a newspaper so i know exactly what you're talking about 

505.81 511.79 A: okay so yeah they they do the same type of paper almost and the same color prints 

511.40 512.60 B: mhm 

512.48 514.24 A: so yeah you would 

513.66 518.53 B: yeah yeah we do layout we're a weekly paper so we do the layout every week and 

517.96 518.85 A: okay 

518.57 521.46 B: we have our own in house graphic artist 

521.04 522.80 A: well what's your position 

522.48 523.83 B: i do accounting 

523.60 524.47 A: okay 

524.25 527.88 B: yeah i do the anal crap that nobody else wants to do [laughter] 

527.21 533.66 A: yeah but are you anal ah in your home life are you good at saving and number crunching and 

531.96 533.00 B: yeah 

533.08 536.70 B: oh yeah yeah that that part of it yeah 

537.41 539.66 A: that's good that's real good 

539.02 541.74 B: yeah if it doesn't drive people nuts it's good 

541.96 545.69 A: yeah i mean if you're getting your goals accomplished 

545.24 546.34 B: yeah 

545.71 550.34 A: because in our society money is a really valuable tool 

550.08 551.20 B: mhm 

550.56 555.99 A: and i mean you you're dependent on it for lots of things 

555.69 556.82 B: yeah 

556.19 561.10 A: so um if you're real good with that that is really good because 

560.27 562.93 B: yeah it it buys you independence 

562.32 565.81 A: yes that's what ah money means to me freedom 

565.53 568.68 B: yeah yeah i i equate that the same way 

568.30 569.30 A: (( mhm )) 

568.69 571.42 B: money means independence and it means freedom 

571.20 572.03 A: yes 

572.25 575.84 B: and if i were to have to rely on someone it would 

576.66 581.03 B: it would really really devastate a certain part of me 

580.67 581.58 A: yeah 

581.27 584.21 B: i i just wouldn't be able to let go like that 

584.60 590.69 A: yeah you'd probably need to have your own job or or your own source of money coming in 

589.23 590.02 B: yeah 

590.44 598.66 B: even if i were married i i i could never not work because i would feel that i would lose my independence and give up a part of myself 

598.21 599.03 A: uh-huh 

598.81 599.89 B: and and that
