13.10 14.38 A: right 

13.75 15.23 B: [lipsmack] oh well 

15.37 24.51 B: i guess i can do that um so the the the minimum wage i can't believe it's like five dollars and fifteen cents 

16.74 18.26 A: [laughter] 

25.22 27.94 A: well they are um 

28.14 31.43 A: [lipsmack] they're arguing about even raising it that high 

31.00 32.27 B: really 

31.96 34.05 A: yeah because uh uh 

34.62 37.34 A: they're complaining that uh um [lipsmack] 

37.35 41.06 A: it's too much money for them to pay out for the workers and everything 

40.84 42.12 B: yeah well 

41.18 43.02 A: isn't it bad 

42.29 46.67 B: yeah no i i uh yeah they so they're there are 

46.79 54.88 B: i mean definitely what it does is it it puts a strain on uh all the places that are hiring that you know employ people 

56.25 59.53 A: well five dollars and fifteen cents 

59.98 64.20 A: is not really much money to live off these in this day and age 

63.24 65.66 B: not at all i mean 

64.51 69.62 A: when you're bread is running what two dollars and something a loaf three dollars and something a loaf 

69.03 73.83 B: yeah well you got to work an hour just to get a get a loaf of bread right 

73.25 80.57 A: mhm and don't throw in anything but the bread [laughter] because really if you 

76.05 77.52 B: right right 

80.79 85.99 A: it's foolish to go to s- to the store unless you start out with at least a twenty dollar bill 

86.29 88.14 A: that's the way i see it 

86.38 87.47 B: yeah 

87.60 95.67 B: yeah now now what i'm what i'm looking at is that that that that is two hundred and six dollars a week 

95.11 96.16 A: right 

95.77 99.18 B: on a full time um 

97.88 98.81 A: mhm 

99.07 100.12 A: basis 

99.20 100.82 B: (( salary pay yeah )) 

101.03 105.04 B: and so it's only it's a little bit more than ten thousand dollars a year 

104.74 110.31 A: [lipsmack] and apartments runs three hundred five hundred 

109.23 110.59 B: (( hm )) 

110.32 111.63 A: (( and up )) 

110.73 114.62 B: hm yeah yeah i'll i'll say [noise] 

114.71 123.42 A: so if you're only making five dollars and something an hour fifteen cents an hour i really don't see how you can actually live 

122.87 126.25 B: aye yeah it's kind of hard to think of how you can even live 

125.95 128.65 A: unless you're living home with your parents 

129.01 136.34 B: right well i guess a l- i guess a lot of the people who are earning minimum wage are are doing that i don't know 

136.38 139.29 A: well that's the only way i can see it because 

139.44 148.98 A: look i mean the food you have to take it and then okay if you're working you're either going to be driving a car or taking public transport- -ation right 

145.38 146.33 B: yeah 

147.09 148.07 B: mhm 

148.08 149.69 B: mhm 

149.15 151.44 A: okay now here is um 

150.31 152.71 B: no you couldn't even afford a car i guess 

152.45 154.02 A: no you couldn't afford a car 

153.40 154.84 B: yeah right 

154.23 157.13 A: 'cause here i'm in philadelphia pennsylvania 

157.16 162.93 A: okay the ride straight one way on public transportation is two dollars and fifty cents 

162.31 163.89 B: is that what it is now 

163.68 164.88 A: (( mhm )) 

164.42 166.33 B: two dollars and fifty cents 

165.64 171.19 A: two dollars and fifty cents and that's without your trans- uh the transport 

167.10 168.28 B: shoo 

170.09 171.36 B: oh my 

171.57 172.86 B: oh my 

173.11 173.99 A: yeah 

174.41 177.08 B: yeah so um 

177.17 187.83 B: so you know like like the take home pay out of five dollars and f- fifteen cents is probably somewhere around four dollars or four dollars and twenty five cents an hour 

186.83 196.21 A: [noise] yeah because they're going to take out you know they're going to take out all your taxes and all like that so when they get done taking out you don't have much to take [laughter] home [laughter] 

190.81 192.44 B: right yeah 

194.85 198.05 B: no and then if you if you're making four dollars 

198.06 205.01 B: uh an hour take home and you got to spend two dollars and fifty cents of it just to start your day 

203.83 205.85 A: yeah and that's just one way 

205.47 212.53 B: just one way and then you got to spend a two and uh so you're s- you're working an hour over an hour 

206.35 207.85 A: that's just one way 

212.30 213.22 A: (( mhm that's )) 

212.85 220.20 B: just er to make enough money to cover uh your transportation to and from work 

216.12 217.17 A: right 

219.89 220.77 A: right 

221.24 222.48 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] wow

223.50 225.49 B: wow that's right yeah

419.32 420.31 A: right 

421.58 425.22 A: the basic needs like food shelter 

422.96 427.12 B: and i'm not sure that five dollars and fifteen cents would provide that 

426.88 435.00 A: no i d- if you i'm trying to think how you could take five dollars and fifteen cents and have food shelter clothing 

434.61 438.00 B: (( boy i don't know how you do it i don't know )) 

436.89 439.18 A: just food shelter and clothing 

438.73 439.90 B: yeah 

439.27 442.88 A: i'm like now these are basic things that you must have 

441.03 442.11 B: right 

442.62 443.90 B: (( right )) 

443.91 446.64 A: and i don't know how you can do it on five dollars and fifteen cents [noise] 

445.09 447.95 B: i i don't know how you could do that no 

448.20 449.44 B: i agree with you 

449.98 452.81 B: i i don't know how that how 

453.98 455.40 B: how that could be done 

455.69 460.71 A: but they expect and but see the people who sets these uh um 

458.20 459.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

460.94 464.08 A: wages they are millionaires 

464.62 467.33 B: oh well yeah yeah well 

464.68 466.49 A: they're billionaires 

467.49 471.20 A: they have no concept of poor 

471.90 477.48 A: of poverty they really i don't believe they have any concept of a of a of a poor of people being poor 

474.82 476.39 B: well i th- i think 

477.07 480.97 B: i think one of the um one of the things that um 

481.77 487.44 B: that they look at er people people consider is the fact that you know if 

487.55 497.34 B: if they raise the wage minimum wage then certain companies are going to go out of business so that there's going to be a certain number of lost jobs 

497.68 509.28 A: you know what i don't believe that honestly i i think you know what if you tell a lie long enough hard enough and convincingly enough everybody believes it 

499.66 501.40 B: (( hm )) 

506.41 507.74 B: [laughter] 

507.90 513.85 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah yeah yeah hm hm 

510.00 523.96 A: you know that's propaganda that's how you get propaganda going because everybody believes it and so these people they're billionaires millionaires but they don't want to pay people enough just for food clothing and shelter 

514.11 515.47 B: hm 

517.55 522.36 B: hm 

524.26 534.98 A: we're not asking for a mansion a swimming pool you know uh vacations over in europe nobody's going over there anymore [laughter] 'cause they're afraid [laughter] 

527.13 528.18 B: right 

533.83 535.66 B: yeah right that's right 

535.63 540.06 A: that's plain common things every day things people need 

539.54 541.40 B: yeah 

540.32 543.47 A: and i'm quite sure they wouldn't go broke 

543.49 544.74 B: yeah 

544.16 546.90 A: if they would pay a minimum wage 

546.50 547.70 B: yeah 

547.10 549.39 A: a decent minimal wage 

548.74 552.23 B: yeah yeah what do you think a decent minimum wage would be 

552.54 555.66 A: (( right at this day around eight dollars an hour )) 

555.09 560.65 B: yeah i i i i think you're probably right about that i i don't think i could argue with that one 

559.13 567.47 A: i think it eight dollars you know i think eight dollars would be a an hour a decent wage for people to live on 

565.48 566.31 B: yeah 

567.07 569.34 B: (( yeah yeah yeah mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

568.98 575.93 A: and the more people had to live on the more money they could spend more money would be generated 

573.69 578.27 B: (( hm )) 

576.02 582.55 A: 'cause to me the everytime you make something higher you just lose more people 

582.97 591.59 A: 'cause i believe if they would lower the prices on transportation people wouldn't drive cars as much and they would have more people on transportation 

591.24 599.89 B: yeah well you know that and and that answers a lot of other problems too you know like pollution and the wear and tear on the roads and 

597.38 598.51 A: yeah
