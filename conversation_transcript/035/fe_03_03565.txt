9.48 10.31 B: so 

10.72 12.90 B: (( what was the minimum wage before )) 

13.23 18.42 A: um i think it was four seventy five but i thought it had been five fifteen for a while 

15.64 16.35 B: (( but )) 

17.61 22.10 B: that yeah that's what i thought too and i thought it was like supposed to be six something now 

21.99 24.72 A: i thought it was going to six twenty five but 

23.81 25.64 B: right right 

24.88 27.21 A: (( i guess we could be wrong [laughter] )) 

26.24 29.34 B: [laughter] yeah i know right maybe it never happened 

28.13 28.82 A: (( but )) 

29.50 33.67 A: [sigh] well i just don't think it's enough for people to live off of anyway 

33.65 35.13 B: yeah that's true 

34.04 36.08 A: not not at five fifteen 

36.16 41.06 B: right but we live in and the economy's like doing terribly now 

36.61 37.96 A: [noise] 

41.16 42.15 A: yeah 

41.49 46.37 B: i i guess um i wouldn't know if i wouldn't be picky if it meant like a job you know 

46.45 47.44 A: right 

48.87 51.90 B: but i think the last time i did um [noise] 

51.96 54.87 B: a minimum wage job was when i was in high school 

54.13 57.56 A: [noise] yeah me too [laughter] but um [noise] 

56.43 57.38 B: yeah 

58.15 66.28 A: i s- still i don't see how people can survive so many people are on welfare i mean and work minimum wage jobs and still have to have welfare 

66.32 68.50 B: i know i know that's true 

70.14 74.78 A: so i don't see how anybody could survive i think it should be more than six twenty five but 

74.84 76.39 B: [laughter] i think it should be 

76.10 76.68 A: (( [noise] )) 

76.43 82.13 B: close to seven because isn't that five something that's that's um before taxes right 

81.55 82.91 A: right right 

82.29 87.17 B: so actually in their pocket i guess they're getting you know two thirds of that right 

87.05 87.98 A: yeah 

88.53 89.81 A: maybe you shouldn't have 

90.35 92.26 A: [laughter] i don't i don't but 

91.12 93.41 B: i'm sorry you're breaking up what was that 

93.03 97.98 A: oh i said if you um make minimum wage you shouldn't have to pay taxes i guess 

98.45 101.01 B: [laughter] is that is that so 

102.01 103.82 A: that's the case 

102.47 104.98 B: oh you shouldn't oh i see 

103.87 107.53 A: yeah 'cause they take out so much in taxes now anyway 

107.33 108.90 B: yeah that's true 

109.04 117.29 B: but then um people who are actually making like seven something or act- and who are paying taxes would think 

117.37 121.11 B: that um they're actually earning earning minimum wage in their pockets 

121.49 128.78 B: right i guess there's um in a way you kinda have to standardize like everyone should pay taxes no matter what 

121.53 122.47 A: right 

122.59 123.33 A: yeah 

128.76 129.83 A: yeah 

130.00 131.06 A: that's true

249.77 256.66 B: i mean when i heard about the increase well what i thought of as being increased to six something i thought oh that's great because i mean 

256.65 269.39 B: um kids you know students uh trying to pay off college whatever i thought that would be like you know that would be a big help and compared to like a twenty five cent raise each year an increase from a dollar something is actually like pretty good

265.18 265.98 A: (( yeah no )) 

269.97 273.09 B: but i don't see how they could do that anymore since uh

407.79 409.17 B: right right 

409.37 410.58 B: that makes sense 

409.83 412.33 A: but i'm sure they make the minimum wage
