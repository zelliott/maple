12.05 14.23 B: [laughter] what about you 

14.67 15.77 B: okay 

19.22 20.76 B: yeah

28.79 29.88 B: yeah 

32.65 34.05 B: i know me too 

34.92 37.73 B: although on one of my calls i did talk to a man 

37.10 38.53 A: oh really 

37.97 40.28 B: i feel more comfortable with a woman though 

39.70 44.78 A: [noise] yeah you know it's just it's kinda odd yeah talking to them you know especially men you don't know [mn] 

40.46 41.60 B: (( kinda glad )) 

42.06 44.24 B: yeah it was kinda awk- 

44.40 46.14 B: right it was awkward 

45.56 52.32 A: that's that's weird [mn] but uh so i guess minimum wage you know i had no idea [noise] minimum wage had even gone up so 

51.30 53.39 B: [noise] i didn't either 

52.72 64.30 A: is it is that like what a federal increase i guess it would have to be because they don't know what states we're you know we're each going to be in [mn] because i know there's different state minimum wages and then federal minimum wages 

63.86 66.57 B: to be honest i don't know 

65.20 67.70 A: [noise] see i had no idea 

66.70 69.87 B: and i've always thought it's it's too low 

69.63 79.96 A: well see that's what i was just sitting here thinking i'm like can you imagine trying to like [mn] support [mn] i mean not even a family just yourself [mn] on five dollars an hour i mean that's that's absolutely ridiculous 

76.53 77.87 B: there's no way 

79.20 86.42 B: there's no way even jo- jobs that were like over minimum wage i've had i'm like this is even horrible [laughter] 

83.01 83.89 A: right 

85.81 91.23 A: yeah exactly well i kinda bitch and moan because i mean i have a second part time job 

90.76 91.65 B: uh-huh 

91.03 101.00 A: outside of my regular job [mn] that you know i'm always complaining 'cause it's only like six fifty an hour or something it's just a little clothing store [mn] but i just keep working there because i just want the discount on clothes for my real job 

95.72 97.11 B: (( yeah [mn] [laughter] )) 

100.87 110.00 A: you know [laughter] [mn] but i mean if i had to live on even six fifty i can't even imagine [mn] i mean 'cause five dollars an hour even if you're working a full forty hour week it's two hundred dollars 

109.77 113.65 B: [noise] yeah there's there's no way you'd have to move in with your parents or something 

110.19 111.54 A: i mean that's nothing 

112.65 121.07 A: exactly [mn] and i mean then you figure just taxes are gonna come out of that and then god forbid you have a child or something i mean that's jus awful 

116.21 117.24 B: yes 

119.09 121.92 B: that would be horrible what would you do 

121.38 124.91 A: i i i just can't even imagine [noise] 

123.34 125.42 B: i i don't know what i would do mhm 

125.05 129.23 A: yeah it's it's really scary and it's it's funny because um 

129.30 140.31 A: i have i had a roommate last year and she says oh i want you know my girlfriend's gonna come and stay with us for a couple weeks [mn] and it's actually funny because a couple of weeks turned into the rest of the year 

139.67 141.23 B: [laughter] 

140.33 153.43 A: but as a matter of fact she's still there i've since moved out and this girl is still there [mn] but she's a sweetheart i love her to death [mn] but she's like one of those people that's like oh you know i can't find a job then i'm like well how hard are you really looking [mn] you know i mean there's 

146.74 147.68 B: uh-huh 

152.29 153.18 B: right 

153.32 166.76 A: i mean not that there's a best job in the world but there's something out there [mn] you know there's always like even if you go through temp agencies things like that [mn] and this girl is like well i think you know i'm just gonna kinda look into getting welfare [noise] and this and i'm going [sigh] 

156.83 157.78 B: right 

166.08 167.13 B: ooh 

166.69 178.37 A: i yeah i'm going i don't think that's what it's for that's for people you know to have kids and that need it and are really having a tough time [mn] not just for somebody like who doesn't feel like getting up off their butt and not looking for a job 

170.09 171.38 B: right [laughter] 

178.04 183.12 B: right and i don't like it when people try to take advantage of welfare 

178.47 180.77 A: that's just you know and i'm thinking 

182.38 184.83 A: exactly that's the thing 

183.37 186.93 B: they need to get out there and and get two jobs if they have to 

185.66 195.49 A: well that's the thing i mean and and i understand you know the thing with the kids you know like [mn] oh sometimes it costs more for like the day care [mn] then you would make bringing it in 

195.27 206.02 A: but i like to think i don't know and i guess 'cause i don't have any kids [mn] but i like to think that there's either like special situations you know where they could find like either reduced childcare 

205.45 206.70 B: (( mhm right )) 

206.05 210.99 A: but then you hear about these people that just keep having more kids so they can get more money 

209.13 210.28 B: oh 

210.46 212.48 B: i've heard about that 

211.65 219.43 A: and i'm going oh my god you know that's just not right [mn] yeah it's just ugh i don't know [mn] i mean 

214.78 216.41 B: this is not right 

218.55 219.93 B: i don't get it 

219.41 231.26 A: yeah i mean like i said i mean i i hate to be judgemental 'cause i don't have any kids so i don't know how expensive it is or any of that [mn] but i know like my sister she's a single mom she actually went out and adopted a little boy 

223.56 224.83 B: i don't either 

228.62 229.54 B: mhm 

231.40 233.41 A: [mn] and she's yeah 

231.82 232.81 B: really 

233.29 237.40 A: and she's a schoolteacher so it's not like you know she's making massive amounts of money 

236.79 237.81 B: (( right mm mhm )) 

237.25 244.85 A: but yet she manages to find you know the really good day care [mn] and even when he just turned six and she got him in school at five 

244.84 259.43 A: and she just decided to take the money that she was already spending on day care [mn] and see what she was able to get in terms of a private school because she's in like an inner city school and she was like ah i don't want my baby in there [mn] you know so she sent him to this like this christian school and she just you know took the money she was already spending on day care 

253.73 254.63 B: right 

256.33 257.21 B: right 

258.86 259.81 B: uh-huh 

259.27 271.62 A: and just turned it right over to that [mn] you know and i'm thinking okay well if she can make this work on one income a school teacher income [mn] you know i i i don't know like i said you never know but there's always exceptions to the rule but 

261.05 262.02 B: uh-huh 

271.55 275.39 A: i'm sorry i believe some of these people have to be able to do a little better than they're doing 

274.93 278.06 B: right some people are just lazy 

275.51 276.61 A: so 

277.56 287.12 A: exactly and that's what pisses you off because then the people that really need it [noise] don't get it [mn] and it's it's a shame it's really a shame so 

280.42 281.30 B: right 

281.95 282.79 B: right 

283.01 284.18 B: that's right 

287.27 296.66 A: [lipsmack] i don't know i mean i guess just i should count my blessings that i'm not in that situation but it's just it's scary it's really scary so 

292.57 293.57 B: right 

295.86 297.33 B: it is 

296.65 302.30 A: [mn] but yeah i mean i guess for the people that actually need it i can't imagine trying to live on 

302.33 316.81 A: five [laughter] dollars an hour [mn] i mean 'cause you figure even [mn] i mean what's the tax it's probably about like twenty eight percent i sitting here doing this on a calculator [mn] yeah well i'm sitting here thinking from you know from that two hundred dollars a week they would probably take home about one fifty 

303.58 304.85 B: i can't either it 

308.05 311.96 B: probably takes like a dollar [mn] almost a dollar or something off mhm 

316.88 320.38 A: now what the heck are you going to do with a hundred and [noise] fifty dollars a week 

316.88 317.88 B: right 

320.02 323.42 B: now if it's like a teenager or something i understand you 

322.59 327.20 A: right exactly well yeah that would make more sense but 

323.68 324.49 B: (( know )) 

325.81 331.01 B: but if it's i i mean i don't know how you how would they would do that but it just doesn't seem fair 

330.39 343.82 A: no not at all [mn] i mean we got minimum wage jobs when we were growing up like we my parents shoved us out the door at fifteen they're like you're not even waiting till sixteen get out there and find something [mn] and you know we worked at like hershey park i i live in pennsylvania well i grew up in pennsylvania 

337.81 339.13 B: right [laughter] 

343.45 344.44 B: (( mhm )) 

343.78 351.67 A: [mn] like hershey park and all that kind of stuff it was a fun job for a kid but yeah it was minimum wage [mn] you know but granted i didn't have to put food on the table or pay rent 

344.99 345.94 B: (( mhm )) 

351.24 352.38 B: right 

351.76 354.23 A: you know i mean that was like you know my uh 

354.41 365.32 A: you know pay to go like buy clothes for school type of money you know it wasn't like i was and then it was three thirty five an hour when i was growing up [mn] yeah can imagine so it's like god [mn] but 

356.34 357.47 B: right 

360.35 362.34 B: oh my gosh i know it 

362.89 363.81 B: (( no ))

375.64 378.06 A: no i'm single and no kids 

378.14 386.94 A: oh okay okay [mn] but yeah i mean so could you imagine i mean let's say your husband has like a minimum wage job and you did i mean you know yeah 

385.90 387.84 B: well i wouldn't have married him [laughter] 

387.86 399.26 A: i mean yeah really i know i'd have been like keep keep biking buddy you know [laughter] [mn] i mean imagine trying to like you know get a car to be able to get to work or get even jump on public transportation [mn] and 

388.96 390.03 B: yeah i can't 

391.18 393.06 B: i know i can't imagine 

395.69 397.00 B: no there's no way 

397.91 405.22 B: i have a friend that her husband only makes thirty thousand dollar a year she stays at home with the kids and there's no way they're struggling so much 

404.55 405.89 A: (( wow oh i )) 

405.45 408.37 B: i i don't i couldn't live off of that 

407.73 414.23 A: bet no well exactly that's what [mn] and again it's like when you're growing up and you come out of college that sounds great you know [mn] you know for like your first job [mn] 

412.67 413.63 B: yeah 

413.86 414.77 B: right 

414.19 426.45 A: but then like you said you figure once you actually are getting like a real house [laughter] a real car [laughter] you know you're not living in a college town off of box crates and things [mn] you know it's god that just doesn't quite cut it anymore 

418.40 419.51 B: right 

422.23 423.48 B: right i mean 

425.71 430.25 B: i mean she can't even afford to get a haircut and she wears rags 

427.71 429.16 A: (( [noise] wow )) 

429.90 433.22 A: that's awful and how many kids do they have 

431.07 432.20 B: yeah i 

432.51 440.51 B: well she has one kid and now she's expecting a second and she was crying because you know she wanted to wait till her husband got a promotion 

435.99 436.99 A: ooh 

440.16 441.35 A: (( [noise] wow )) 

440.80 447.92 B: and um she wants the kid but it's just uh the money is not there so 

446.41 448.48 A: [mn] yeah you have to be able to afford him 

448.50 453.03 B: [mn] so for people making minimum wage i can't even imagine 

451.20 452.18 A: (( [mn] )) 

452.73 460.50 A: now does he have benefits and everything like healthcare benefits and all that good stuff [mn] god 'cause i mean even hospital bills are gonna just kill them 

454.68 456.60 B: not at all no 

460.13 461.98 B: ooh i didn't even think about that 

460.98 468.90 A: you know imagine that 'cause that's like if you think a lot of the minimum wage jobs probably don't have you know healthcare coverage and 

466.18 476.94 B: right and and th- what they do is they just use credit cards and they they they can't help it they just don't make enough that they they they have to and that's just awful 

469.40 470.65 A: wow 

472.29 474.17 A: yeah they don't have any choice 

476.62 478.23 A: (( that's horrible )) 

477.43 478.97 B: that is horrible 

478.39 485.44 A: [mn] i mean they really need and you know what kills me is that the people that are setting these minimum wage are like these 

485.46 489.88 A: [mn] whoever the heck they are senators congress people whatever that are just like making 

490.08 497.77 A: [mn] hundreds of thousands dollars to sit on their asses and do absolutely nothing you know they have no real concept of what it takes 

492.58 494.77 B: oh i know it 

498.11 501.52 A: [mn] you know the amount of money it takes especially to raise a child 

498.37 499.47 B: (( that's right )) 

500.95 502.26 B: that's right 

501.63 505.05 A: i mean that's that's just terrible and 

504.95 515.62 A: uh i don't know i i can't even imagine i mean i sit here like i said i'm single no kids no husband it's me and my dog [mn] you know and i'm sitting here going oh you know i'm so selfish i'm like oh i think i want to take a trip this year 

515.40 523.55 A: damn i don't have enough to go to europe i guess i'm only going to be able to go on a cruise you know what i mean that's like my big worry [mn] and i mean i can't imagine if i had a child 

518.91 519.87 B: (( yes )) 

520.24 521.32 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

523.20 524.30 B: oh i know 

523.66 525.48 A: oh my god it would [mn] 

524.75 526.68 B: it's gotta be expensive mhm 

526.08 531.30 A: yeah i i i you know i see the things that my sister gets for 

531.08 545.30 A: her little boy and things like that you know and sh- she has me and my mom you know i mean my mom [mn] you know we're all i'm the youngest so we're all up and out of the house and she's retired but you know she gets her pension and [mn] you know money from the divorce from my dad so she helps her out a little bit if she [mn] if it ever gets tight and 

535.02 535.81 B: right 

545.14 552.13 A: you know i help her out with clothes and things like that [mn] but even still and she's one of those people that's really anal with budgeting so she's never in a tight spot 

551.60 552.71 B: (( mm right )) 

552.01 562.39 A: but i just can't imagine trying to do it on [mn] i mean i think maybe as a teacher she probably makes maybe thirty seven or so and even with that it's still at time she's like struggling [noise] 

558.59 559.58 B: uh-huh 

561.94 567.30 B: wow what does she do during the summer does she just take it off or does she get another job 

562.50 563.84 A: (( you know she like )) 

565.41 566.65 A: (( [mn] you know what )) 

566.48 569.51 A: that's what makes me mad because my mom and i keep saying 

568.84 570.34 B: she needs to get a job 

569.31 578.31 A: you have three months off get a job work at something like a a walmart where you can get clothes and food and everything else you know you get a discount [noise] [mn] and you can get clothes for the baby clothes for you 

578.13 590.48 A: she's like no she likes to take that time to spend with him [mn] so i'm like [mn] yeah right you know the kid would get over it [laughter] you know i mean i love him to death but [mn] he can spend time with grandma and aunt jen you know i mean 

584.94 586.48 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

589.75 591.14 B: yeah 

590.55 599.89 A: so but she's just like no that's [mn] i almost can't blame her just because [mn] i hear some of the horror stories she encounters during the year and i think i might need [mn] at least a month mental health
