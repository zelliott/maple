0.00 0.76 B: [noise] 

0.90 2.06 A: hello 

1.75 2.90 B: hi 

2.54 3.55 A: hi 

2.97 4.74 B: hi my name is jamie 

4.55 6.31 A: (( jamie hi i'm teresa )) 

5.91 7.45 B: hi how are you 

6.71 14.52 A: hi um good [laughter] so um okay so the topic was um minimum wage so 

9.89 10.78 B: [laughter] 

13.97 16.27 B: right right 

14.87 17.69 A: do you think five fifteen is 

17.82 18.94 A: sufficient 

18.43 20.10 B: yeah 

19.28 22.49 A: what is it right now actually do you do you know 

22.55 27.06 B: i'm not sure i think h- here in jersey it's five 

27.42 30.51 B: well it was five oh five yeah i guess it is about five fifteen 

31.08 32.95 A: (( okay see i don't even know what )) 

33.23 37.30 A: don't really like yeah i don't even know what the uh real minimum wage is 

37.44 38.98 A: so um 

40.84 45.12 A: [lipsmack] so i g- i guess i don't really know the comparison [laughter] so 

43.83 52.23 B: [noise] i know but i i guess it's well five dollars and fifteen cents is practically nothing g- uh you know even hourly once you take tax out 

47.60 48.44 A: right 

49.77 51.91 A: yeah i know of course 

52.33 53.25 B: so 

52.51 55.83 A: um you're right i'm just trying to think um 

55.86 58.19 A: it definitely is well 

58.22 70.09 A: i'm trying to think yeah it's with taxes it's going to be literally nothing so definitely it's it's obviously not enough but minimum wage only really applies to certain jobs 

69.96 71.05 B: right 

70.85 77.56 A: at the same instance um i feel like you know i don't really know about minimum wage really but i feel like it's 

77.65 83.08 A: always is like kids who do like after school jobs and you know what i'm trying to say 

81.49 87.17 B: yeah yeah exactly like students and retired people 

84.83 87.11 A: right and 

87.26 92.41 A: i mean it's definitely not a lot especially in this kind of economy 

92.48 95.49 A: um you know um 

93.98 95.80 B: yeah 

95.63 102.31 A: five fifteen i mean that it's like working a lot just to make four hours just to make twenty dollars not even with taxes taken out you know 

101.87 103.28 B: right right 

103.34 104.30 A: um 

104.49 108.91 A: so it's definitely not good but then on the other hand 

109.11 112.94 A: i don't really know how much more you can give um 

113.65 117.50 A: a you know from a company standpoint without like losing out [laughter] 

116.91 130.41 B: yeah exactly like to ah 'cause some of most of the jobs that are minimum wage are so simple or not all but some can be you know but i mean like yeah they they're not going to just change and say hey let's pay them twelve dollars an hour [sigh] 

122.79 125.82 A: right yeah i know i know what you're saying though 

129.88 133.16 A: right like you know if you're a cashier at a place um 

134.30 135.88 A: it y- you know it's 

136.18 138.23 A: you can't really give them 

138.28 142.65 A: a l- not that doesn't make sense i don't want to sound like rude or anything 

143.01 144.80 B: uh-uh say whatever 

144.80 145.92 A: [laughter] 

145.21 148.75 B: (( you know you got um [laughter] )) 

146.09 147.94 A: [laughter] all right [laughter] 

147.97 149.01 A: um 

149.02 152.23 A: so i g- i mean i guess it's definitely not sufficient [laughter] 

152.25 153.68 B: yeah 

153.22 154.10 A: so 

154.11 154.83 B: (( um )) 

155.10 157.35 B: hm i'm trying to think 

155.11 156.02 A: um 

156.41 159.68 A: did you ever work for a job that you was making minimum wage 

159.52 167.13 B: yeah but like you said you know like back when i was a student or in college you know and it's a little different then you have a different perspective and different 

166.98 176.95 A: right especially like when you're living with your parents you know um and you're you're just making money so you can you know get by in the summer or buy your extra expenses 

167.91 169.72 B: responsibilities 

170.27 171.30 B: right 

176.64 177.64 B: mhm 

177.31 187.92 A: but as you get older i mean if you're really if your job you depend on is the minimum wage that that's nothing you know it's you're not gonna buy anything 

184.08 187.81 B: yeah you can't even make rent anything 

189.15 190.06 A: so 

190.20 194.89 A: but i honestly don't know how much they would have to raise it to um you know 

194.52 199.39 B: yeah yeah that's a good point because yeah you can't even live independently 

195.90 196.77 A: so 

199.39 206.51 A: (( yeah you really can't and especially if you have like a full family to raise and et cetera et cetera that's it's it's not gonna do anything for you [laughter] )) 

206.60 216.64 B: like i know in a lot a tourist areas like even where most of the jobs are minimum wage like quay west and everything people down there work like three or four you know like two or three part time jobs at one time 

214.44 216.15 A: yeah 

216.68 218.78 B: just to and they're all minimum wage 

216.73 221.92 A: right but it's also it's it's really also different like standard of living 

221.65 223.24 B: yeah 

221.99 225.72 A: so and like i mean i i you said you live in jersey right 

225.38 226.31 B: yeah 

226.49 228.05 A: um where in jersey 

228.16 233.62 B: okay oh i'm sorry i thought you said you're like me too um we're in north jersey uh burden county 

230.35 231.15 A: oh 

232.78 244.63 A: right and it's still so it's still pretty like kind of like 'cause i live in the city i mean minimum wage in the city is gonna get you nothing but you're like you know subway pass is already two dollars you know [laughter] um i 

236.60 237.60 B: okay 

242.84 244.54 B: yeah 

244.97 246.01 A: (( don't know )) 

246.07 246.90 A: it's 

247.21 251.46 A: i- it it really depe- you know especially it depends on where you know money [mn] 

251.65 255.88 A: you're spending the money 'cause out in the caribbean et cetera you don't have to 

255.95 261.37 A: pay for like the taxes that you know we all pay [laughter] you know things like that so 

259.08 260.37 B: (( uh-huh )) 

261.96 263.47 A: (( but it's i don't know )) 

263.90 265.04 A: um 

265.68 275.21 A: [lipsmack] what else [laughter] these are always so funny 'cause like i this is like my second one and i definitely after like five minutes i was like all right [laughter] 

267.61 269.35 B: [laughter] i know i'm like 

274.58 281.00 B: yeah this is my first one i actually i saw it on today and i was like this can't be for real and then it 

276.99 278.02 A: oh 

280.23 284.75 A: (( yeah it's so do you know what they they call me kind of almost every day now so it's kind of weird )) 

284.83 285.99 B: really 

284.95 288.27 A: [lipsmack] um yeah sometimes it's you can't do it you know 

288.82 292.23 A: 'cause i'm walking on the street and my cellphone is just kind of funny so 

288.83 290.49 B: i just 

292.60 300.23 B: see that's funny and and they actually like i mean i just wanna not to sound like it's all about the money but i hope that they do actually pay out [laughter] 

299.70 307.31 A: yeah honestly i've signed up for maybe two weeks now i haven't gotten anything yet but i don't know what the limit is to have when you get things 

306.90 309.01 B: (( yeah yeah i know what you're saying )) 

307.61 313.56 A: (( you know what i'm saying like i don't know if it's um [lipsmack] like oh you have to do ten of them and then something happens i i really have no idea )) 

312.96 313.93 B: right 

313.86 314.67 A: so 

315.09 316.45 A: (( i don't know )) 

315.58 318.36 B: but ten minutes is a long time [laughter] 

318.19 323.94 A: yeah like it didn't doesn't seem like it at the time but really it is [laughter] [laughter] so 

321.85 329.93 B: yeah well yeah especially when you just have like one specific topic thrown at you and you're you don't have really have that much to say on it [laughter] 

324.88 329.33 A: one thing to talk about yeah yeah 

330.30 333.92 A: (( um minimum wage minimum wage um )) 

334.72 344.71 A: i uh so again recap i guess um if you're an adult raising a family minimum wage is not going to be good enough but y- you can't like set a st- government wise you really can't set a standard 

337.93 339.14 B: work 

344.33 345.26 B: right 

345.18 355.41 A: as to oh you can get minimum wage of five dollars and you can get minimum wage of seven dollars you know 'cause that would be like y- yeah crazy 'cause then you have to deal with like you know 

350.69 351.86 B: mhm 

356.36 358.59 A: [mn] you can't even get into that you know 

358.31 360.24 B: mhm 

359.99 361.73 A: so i don't know i mean i 

362.07 364.28 A: (( and my question is these these )) 

364.41 369.52 A: conversations they ask of us what are they trying to get out of 'em are they trying to change minimum wage like you know 

369.14 379.87 B: i think actually it's all different topics i think it's more of like a linguistics thing like they wanna hear our our voices like our tone like what area of the country you're from 

380.08 381.26 A: (( hm )) 

381.04 383.51 B: you know that's why i think it was important 

383.63 384.75 B: um 

384.91 390.04 B: what did they ask where we were from originally and then like what we spoke and then 

386.49 388.80 A: (( right yeah yeah yeah )) 

390.23 395.86 B: i i forget that i thought i think there was something else that i read that made me think that but i can't remember what specifically 

398.39 399.41 B: (( but i don't know )) 

400.33 401.26 A: yeah 

402.89 412.11 B: i'm trying to think ah like l- it's like are they going to be like oh those two didn't talk about anything they're supposed to [laughter] [laughter] the way it [laughter] no 

403.48 405.86 A: (( um i know [laughter] )) 

409.11 410.81 A: (( i know u- um i i [mn] )) 

411.19 413.85 A: (( it's kind of i know it's um let's see let's see )) 

413.86 418.54 A: [lipsmack] um mm [laughter] just trying to think of something else to talk about um 

419.76 428.32 B: they're probably going to laugh when they listen to all these conversations 'cause probably everybody is probably saying the same thing to each other [sigh] like oh how do we talk about this for ten minutes [laughter] 

421.45 422.91 A: (( i know right yeah )) 

428.03 432.53 A: (( [laughter] like first of all can you make minimum wage like )) 

432.54 438.29 A: at a store web or without getting taxes taken out because 

438.39 442.85 A: i know like i mean my friends who like waitressed and everything 

443.22 454.35 A: and they were getting minimum wage of like say two dollars an hour but then they get their tips you know but sometimes like your tips could be really horrible so it's kind of like you're not guaranteed more or less money you know 

446.89 448.71 B: mhm right 

456.36 458.77 B: i wonder i'm i bet you can't 

457.93 465.44 A: 'cause i know i know that like 'cause they also like you know by not getting taxes that you get straight even like you know straight two dollars instead you know [laughter] 

465.06 466.53 B: right right 

467.96 469.37 B: (( i don't know )) 

469.91 470.58 A: hm 

472.64 474.17 B: that's a good question 

473.91 474.70 A: hm 

476.64 477.27 A: (( um )) 

478.26 482.11 A: [mn] but i'm also i'm also pretty sure i'm sure that if you 

482.30 486.40 A: if you you know are on minimum wage you know job um 

487.28 490.83 A: i i i feel like they don't tax you as much because you know 

490.49 494.57 B: yeah you're probably in a lower tax bracket so they take out less 

491.94 501.30 A: yeah you'd have to be there's like no way they'd be like that mean to take out [laughter] you know nothing you'll probably you'll probably get most of it back that's what i'm assuming 

501.00 502.76 B: mhm 

502.06 503.72 A: at least i'm guessing now 

504.14 505.05 A: um 

505.66 506.50 A: so 

507.28 510.12 A: um what else [laughter] 

510.48 513.33 B: (( let's see and uh uh uh you're kind of )) 

510.84 513.74 A: (( we're getting there we're getting toward ten minutes )) 

514.38 516.55 A: (( [lipsmack] um oh )) 

516.38 517.81 B: (( we're getting through it )) 

518.83 519.47 A: (( um )) 

524.04 535.56 B: let's see i guess some people are probably maybe some people that work not all but some um that work low income jobs maybe they're used to it too like maybe they grew up 

535.64 538.80 B: being in that environment like not having a lot of money and then 

538.51 544.38 A: right no i completely understand but i mean if you think about how little money that is 

538.96 540.48 B: you know it's the minimum wage 

541.90 543.53 B: (( but it's tough )) 

544.34 546.44 B: it's nothing it's nothing 

545.38 548.29 A: i i mean you know it's just kind of i 

549.33 553.92 A: mean think about it you're you're working all day to make just say forty dollars 

553.86 554.75 B: right 

554.33 558.15 A: [laughter] [laughter] and that's without the taxes taken out you know 

557.68 559.27 B: (( mhm )) 

560.18 561.87 B: yeah 

560.24 561.76 A: (( you know so )) 

565.74 566.69 B: (( i know )) 

570.61 571.82 A: (( uh-huh )) 

572.84 577.96 A: (( like what else [laughter] this has exhausted every angle on this [laughter] )) 

577.66 579.68 B: i know me too 

580.70 582.59 B: (( i'm trying to think uh )) 

580.82 581.84 A: (( mm [mn] )) 

584.50 585.87 A: um 

588.40 589.14 A: (( huh )) 

589.36 593.67 A: yeah i th- i so i don't i don't i really didn't um i've never 

594.00 595.05 A: um 

595.53 599.74 A: [lipsmack] worked at a job with a minimum wage like i guess i've really
