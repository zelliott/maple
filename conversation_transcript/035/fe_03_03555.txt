30.35 34.71 A: [noise] yeah i imagine it's about the same there too though right the 

33.40 38.46 B: oh i think it's a national uh it's national from what i understand but 

37.82 43.04 A: yeah but i mean i mean you know even if that's the minimum [noise] you can't you can't get workers 

43.25 47.91 A: to work for that little most of the time [noise] i mean even here at mcdonalds you make six dollars an hour 

48.15 51.71 A: so no i don't think i don't think five fifteen an hour is uh [noise] 

51.89 53.57 A: even near enough 

52.97 64.18 B: no not not at all nor nor do i if you at most you have a lot of single parents raising children uh that are are are you know are economically uh you know uh 

54.21 55.45 A: that's kind of crazy 

58.91 60.65 A: mhm 

64.45 72.62 B: [noise] not good in in not a good way and they go out to get a job and when they tell ya that you're gonna make five fifteen an hour it almost makes you want to stay home [noise] 

72.11 73.64 A: yeah exactly i mean 

73.77 87.38 A: what you what your wage is that should be enough to support at least yourself and five dollars i mean it's really five dollars that's not enough to support yourself it's certainly not enough to support a spouse [noise] or [noise] you know a kid [noise] and uh [noise] 

88.15 89.96 A: (( you know it's just insane [noise] that's [noise] [laughter] )) 

89.54 97.57 B: it it it is l- like i said earlier i was under the impression [laughter] that i thought minimum wage was like seven fifty an hour 

97.15 99.06 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

97.86 101.76 B: and i i don't i i wonder if their stats are correct 

101.35 111.15 A: i don't i don't know about that [noise] because it is pretty low but [noise] i i've worked i've worked for less when it was lower so i don't think it's that high i think it's [noise] it's just [noise] you know 

111.26 119.39 A: [noise] er i i can't im- i don't think there's any jobs that actually pay that except for like you know mcdonalds or something it it it's like 

117.48 120.96 B: [noise] i i think mcdonalds pays more more than that 

120.31 122.26 A: i think you're right actually [laughter] 

121.58 130.62 B: ay yeah [laughter] i mean i i know a couple of people that work in the local mcdonalds here and uh not that they're doing very well but they're you know they're they're doing okay 

130.37 137.22 A: yeah and [noise] and this so what do you think it should be [noise] what do you think the minimum should be [noise] [noise] 

131.03 132.26 B: y- you know 

135.83 141.77 B: i think the minimum wage should be at least i don't about eight eight nine dollars an hour 

141.41 142.73 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

141.92 154.56 B: at least because a lot of um uh i know a lot of college grads that are out there right now and it it you know i don't know how it i- how it is down in your area down in texas but i know jobs up this way are very scarce 

147.80 149.93 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

154.49 156.97 A: oh yeah it's [noise] really bad here 

156.63 158.36 B: also down there 

157.64 164.01 A: [noise] [noise] oh yeah we we have all the tech people [noise] and so [noise] it's just gone [noise] you know straight down the toilet [noise] 

164.03 165.55 A: since uh [noise] 

165.60 176.24 A: since everything you know since the economy's so horrible [noise] but i mean [noise] you can't the thing is is that i guess you're kind of in a bind because you gotta get the job you can get so 

176.59 186.07 B: [mn] well i i know up in the philadelphia area we have uh er w- we're not far from the south jersey area where a lot of summer jobs are open for kids 

176.80 178.18 A: (( i i )) 

182.40 184.80 A: (( i mhm )) 

185.91 186.84 A: yeah 

186.13 189.10 B: like a lot of college kids or high school kids 

189.17 200.84 B: and they were saying that you know due to the the poor economy a lot of these jobs are gonna be in danger for these kids but wi- with the fact that the adults are going out adults are going out and getting these jobs 

200.98 202.29 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

201.07 203.77 B: these summer jobs just to make ends meet [noise] 

203.64 204.90 A: yeah i mean 

205.32 208.89 A: [sigh] that is that is happening yeah but i mean 

210.04 215.56 A: if you think about how much that i mean okay five dollars an hour right 

215.63 219.06 A: [noise] that's like eight hundred a month right 

217.82 220.16 B: yeah well for a forty hour work week 

219.51 222.29 A: yeah i mean if you're working full time that's 

222.70 224.88 A: yeah i mean you'd have to have two jobs 

224.72 227.77 B: yeah well a lot most people do have two jobs 

227.00 228.40 A: i mean yeah [laughter] 

227.81 236.81 B: [laughter] [laughter] you know just just to just to pay the bills it seems like everybody just working to pay their bills but i i you know get not not to repeat myself but i i c- 

228.59 230.15 A: that's coerced 

236.85 245.32 B: i'm going to check into that fact i'm gonna go on the internet or whatever and try to find out what the i believe it's national if i'm not mistaken [mn] 

238.99 240.23 A: yeah 

244.52 249.15 A: yeah i know that that's something indicated that it's something that's determined by the uh 

249.16 253.16 A: you know the treasury board or something or the labor board 

252.58 253.83 B: yes 

253.21 257.89 A: something i mean i know that we have to see i work for the government so 

257.57 258.66 B: oh you do 

258.13 264.83 A: yeah [laughter] we get we get more than that [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] but 

258.70 260.08 B: oh well [laughter] 

260.94 265.30 B: [laughter] oh y- yeah [laughter] i'm i'm sure i'm sure you do 

265.11 278.53 A: but like i i think i think either the treasury board or the labor board determines it and i know that like that's just [noise] for certain jobs i know that you can get paid less than that if you work like in food service 

278.09 279.26 B: yes 

278.69 280.14 A: where you get tips 

279.86 281.02 B: right 

280.40 285.38 A: i had a friend who worked for a restaurant and she got i think like two fifty an hour 

285.72 286.72 B: wow 

285.75 289.72 A: but yeah but i mean you know she get she gets tips 

288.67 297.36 B: o- okay th- th- they kind of compensated that though with with i s- i guess they figured she with her tips she might be making six seven dollars an hour 

295.03 296.65 A: mhm 

296.89 305.24 A: yeah i mean she usually made a lot more just because you know if you're good you get you get pretty good tips but still i mean that's that's a 

305.29 317.49 A: that's a horrible way for them to cheat ya there 'cause people don't you know always tip well and you know what if you don't have any people come in and that's kind of lame you know so at least they should be getting the minimum since minimum's like nothing [mn] 

317.13 321.33 B: well you know it's it's not a subject that you talk about every day 

320.71 322.23 A: (( but yeah )) 

321.38 328.74 B: you know you don't go to work and say uh to your co-worker like well you know what do you think about the minimum wage y- you know what i mean 

326.37 327.95 A: yeah 

328.25 334.92 A: [laughter] well it's kind of hard 'cause 'cause like everyone pretty much agrees yeah it's kind of low but you know if they raised it then 

335.24 342.01 A: all of a sudden mcdonalds would cost more and star- your co- your starbucks well your starbucks coffee couldn't cost much more but you know [laughter] 

341.29 344.27 B: yeah oh that's expensive enough as it is 

342.85 346.57 A: and uh it that's exactly 'cause that's about what they make an hour 

346.62 347.89 A: (( [laughter] incredible )) 

347.14 349.59 B: (( but yeah yeah [laughter] )) 

348.74 350.45 A: you pay for your day in coffee 

350.01 363.54 B: well e- exactly i i just don't i i i'm just amazed like i said uh i'm gonna go ba- i'm gonna check this out and find out what exactly the minimum wage is and like i said i was under the impression it was like seven dollars or over 

356.87 357.98 A: yeah 

363.16 368.78 A: yeah and i think [sigh] i used to make four fif- four ninety 

369.00 372.35 A: and that was you know a while back it was like maybe five years ago 

372.15 373.34 B: right 

372.72 379.67 A: but it was like four seventy five then so it probably isn't that much higher i thought maybe they'd i thought clinton raised it it 

379.50 392.65 B: i i thought he did too but then again you hear a lot of these ow you know when you listen to the uh uh economist or whatever on t._v. they say that sometimes raising the minimum wage is bad for the economy but i i i don't i don't understand that 

379.69 380.72 A: (( was like )) 

392.03 396.91 A: well yeah it's it's okay to give like it's good for the economy to give people money 

397.09 399.40 A: like [mn] randomly 

399.63 406.58 A: you know like three hundred dollars a year or something you know their their rebate but it's bad to give them more money like consistently throughout the year 

406.42 407.96 B: well i- if some 

406.65 408.86 A: yeah especially if they're working [mn] [noise] 

408.10 422.86 B: yeah but if they're working and they're making a decent minimum wage you know that you know that puts more ba- you know bang for your buck and and and the economy i would think would would um w- would ju- you know would would rebound you know where people would go out and buy more goods 

419.90 420.89 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

422.53 430.24 A: yeah especially right now i think that would you know even even if you raised it like forty dollars and even if you're getting like forty dollars more 

430.52 440.28 A: a m- a week you know if you raise it like a dollar you know then they'd s- they'd still they probably would be spending that money on you know consumer goods which would you know increase 

431.89 432.82 B: right 

440.43 443.75 A: would would would make more jobs and stuff like that so 

442.70 444.29 B: absolutely 

443.82 455.37 A: i think they should raise it i mean i i who could say they can't and they shouldn't raise it because you know especially the people who make minimum wage are the people who work you know really hard and they do a lot of manual labor and stuff [noise] so 

452.02 453.33 B: yes they do 

454.17 455.44 B: yes they do 

455.39 463.11 A: so it's kind of sad that they're [noise] they're doing something you know [noise] s- standing up all day and breaking their back you know [noise] and everything 

461.62 469.76 B: well well i've been there and done that i've worked in a factory in a fil- actually a film where uh where i processed film envelopes all day 

464.72 466.01 A: yeah 

469.12 470.54 A: oh god [noise] 

469.85 474.91 B: and that that was quite boring after eight hours and it was tedious you know what i mean 

472.14 473.45 A: (( [laughter] )) 

474.50 475.95 A: yeah 

474.98 482.89 B: uh a- and and you're really you know you actually you got tired mentally and physically you know 'cause it was the same rhetoric over and over again 

481.80 484.41 A: yeah ay yeah 

483.55 489.55 B: you know but it was it was spending money and you know y- y- you gotta do what you gotta do you know what i mean 

489.12 490.95 A: exactly and plus you 

490.07 491.03 B: but 

490.97 493.38 A: you know college students are 

493.41 502.10 A: are are usually the ones who really work minimum wage and high school students too i guess [noise] you know they they have to sacrifice all that time when they should be studying 

502.32 510.27 A: you know like they they they really should be able to make enough money like you know say they can work twenty hours 

502.34 503.73 B: (( r- right )) 

510.03 511.29 B: (( mhm i )) 

510.18 517.97 A: you know they should be able to make enough money in that time so that they can you know have at least some time to study or you know even 

517.73 529.03 A: maybe go out with friends once in a while but you know if you're having to go to college and work forty hours a week just to make ends meet uh you can't really dedicate yourself to your studies you know [noise] so 

526.59 531.83 B: i uh i agree i agree i know back i'm a lot older than you i think but um 

530.91 534.47 A: [noise] yeah well [laughter] i'm twenty three 

532.14 533.52 B: [laughter] 

533.57 544.43 B: no well i'm i'm th- uh i'm thirty years older than you [laughter] [laughter] well i worked back in my days for you know um er in high school 

537.68 539.21 A: oh wow okay [laughter] 

544.38 553.91 B: and i worked at a local uh supermarket and back then and i'm going back in the sixties i made three dollars and thirty three cents an hour and that was big money 

553.76 555.84 A: yeah oh yeah 

554.39 557.21 B: that was big time money back then 

557.39 561.24 B: three thirty three an hour you know that was you know i was and y- y- you know i was 

558.80 559.97 A: yeah 

561.25 572.26 B: r- you know that you were rich you know what i mean i had a car i had my first car and you know and i i d- and i think it was much i don't even know what minimum wage was back in the sixties 

563.08 564.00 A: (( yeah i )) 

572.30 575.53 B: er i know it wasn't three dollars and thirty three cents an hour 

572.36 573.34 A: (( don't i )) 

575.57 577.52 A: don't know if they had it back then 

577.12 591.93 B: yeah they did i believe that they did and i don't think it was three it might have been maybe three dollars or a little less but i was making more than minimum wage you know er you know uh being a cashier at a supermarket and like i said that was considered a lot of money 

577.89 579.14 A: (( did they oh )) 

592.07 593.50 A: yeah 

593.16 597.33 B: you know we were we were unionized and you know the whole nine yards 

593.58 594.39 A: like 

597.21 598.39 A: huh 

597.61 599.89 B: you know even though i was part time and
