19.26 24.90 A: um [sigh] i do not think the minimum wage is enough at all not even close 

24.96 28.40 B: well how much do you think the minimum minimum minimum wage should be 

28.62 31.60 A: i think it should be eight dollars an hour 

30.48 42.70 B: eight eight dollars yeah well and when i was living in san francisco um california um the minimum wage i think was about that that amount and that was sufficient 

42.51 43.51 A: yes 

43.14 50.50 B: barely to cover the cost of living in san francisco it's extremely expensive um 

50.59 58.49 B: [lipsmack] but it still wasn't it didn't really cover a lot cover a lot of things like yeah h- healthcare and those kinds of things 

58.17 63.31 A: y- yes because most of those jobs don't have healthcare included either 

58.68 59.59 B: you know

77.95 79.26 A: i agree 

80.96 82.41 A: (( no [noise] [sigh] )) 

81.67 85.91 B: you know but certainly five dollars an hour isn't an ample wage 

84.61 88.23 A: it's not even not even close to adequate 

87.65 89.49 B: mm mm no 

88.56 96.66 A: um here here in iowa the cost of living is is fairly low com- compared to some of the larger cities 

96.45 97.67 B: mhm 

97.31 101.23 A: so i'm thinking eight but it may need to be ten i don't know 

101.28 103.30 B: (( yeah )) 

101.51 106.25 A: i just i i can't believe it's still at five fifteen it's 

105.48 108.15 B: i know i can't either it's just out- 

106.80 108.83 A: no one can survive 

108.27 111.57 B: outrageous no no not at all 

111.60 115.73 B: um it's not a very just society you know 

115.90 119.87 B: you know in in canada um [lipsmack] people 

120.20 121.54 B: uh look at 

121.80 125.18 B: um the prime minister as being somewhat of a semi 

125.32 127.95 B: or a pseudo dictatorship you know 

127.52 128.69 A: mhm 

127.98 129.43 B: because there isn't 

129.94 132.23 B: there isn't um you 

133.44 142.42 B: know the kind of support the kind of of a level of of care that there should be for the grassroots level who are working 

142.93 144.52 B: you know in order to 

144.75 147.96 B: provide the government with the funds that they 

148.20 154.37 B: have in order to do what they're supposed to be doing which is not really a lot compared to what 

154.43 157.38 B: how much money they make as politicians 

157.54 160.00 B: you know i mean right now we have labor 

160.01 161.20 A: yes 

160.49 162.94 B: um the uh retirement 

163.12 166.62 B: situation and the retirement situation is not 

166.87 172.75 A: well if you're making five fifteen an hour there's no way you're gonna be able to save anything for retirement 

172.04 173.60 B: mhm 

172.98 184.28 A: i would bet that at five fifteen an hour well but they probably make a few dollars above whatever it is for [mn] to qualify for uh [mn] 

184.60 186.87 A: government assistance [laughter] 

186.10 187.03 B: mhm

309.77 319.45 B: to be on social assistance and at the end of the three when by the time christian's three go to a job that's paying you know minimum wage i mean that would be his 

319.59 323.62 B: his desire to yeah because he doesn't want to see 

320.03 322.33 A: his preference oh [sigh] 

323.74 326.26 B: people get ahead because knowledge is power

460.54 462.58 A: i i [mn] 

460.78 470.05 B: billions of tri- trillions of dollars of o- of oil i suspect because they didn't find any mass y- you know mass destruction uh

474.67 476.86 B: no and in fact 

475.01 483.46 A: well we get we get a lot of the propaganda here you you know it's always slanted i try to watch b._b._c. so that i get kind of the world view 

477.83 478.88 B: yeah 

480.06 480.99 B: (( mhm )) 

481.89 482.72 B: some 

483.11 484.43 B: mhm 

483.66 486.83 A: of what's happening too but the 

485.90 498.18 B: i don't w- i don't w- i don't have cable i don't watch i don't have one television show one television station that comes into my television everything that's on my television i put on it because it's it's through a video 

493.23 494.12 A: [sigh] 

497.96 499.28 A: yes 

498.65 502.92 B: and if i want something informative i go to the library and pick something up from that 

502.29 508.80 A: i think that's a really good idea 'cause [mn] [laughter] 'cause it's really some they can slant it so much 

504.01 506.25 B: and if i y- yeah and 

508.14 509.89 B: yeah 

509.34 510.50 A: but um 

510.35 511.24 B: (( so )) 

510.91 520.40 A: [lipsmack] i i don't know i i understand the other side too that the bu- the small businesses are going to really struggle or they do struggle you know the beginning 

519.09 527.29 B: mhm well well the you know the interesting part of out of that is that um if you look at the uh the labor force 

527.37 534.79 B: pre- predominantly the small businesses are the businesses that are actually um employing these people 

534.54 535.95 A: mhm 

535.21 536.32 B: so 

536.87 549.75 B: you know i mean in one sense it's a good thing but in another sense i mean as a small businessman can you afford to have to offer you know a reasonable wage and can you afford to offer 

549.82 550.79 B: um 

550.96 557.50 B: you know benefits that that would be able to cover i- i- you know all the needs of of your employees 

557.10 565.62 A: [noise] i have a friend that is a business owner and she [sigh] was complaining that even now she pays more than minimum 

565.49 567.05 B: mhm 

565.55 577.35 A: she i think she pays about ten dollars an hour but she said on top of that you have to add another almost a half so fifteen dollars about for a ten dollar an hour person 

577.51 581.30 A: just for social security benefits work comp 

579.56 590.50 B: mhm worker's comp worker's compensation and did you hear what worker's compensation in canada just lost um well over a billion dollars lost 

581.46 582.56 A: (( wo- [sigh] )) 

588.73 589.86 A: (( oh [mn] )) 

590.57 594.59 B: because they put it in some trust and the trust company robbed them blind 

594.27 598.79 A: oh no and now so they're going to have to increase that now 

594.99 597.27 B: and they lost it so 

598.14 599.60 B: mhm 

598.92 599.89 A: to make up for
