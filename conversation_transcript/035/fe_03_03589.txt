117.05 126.05 A: d- uh uh much higher than that and he said e- uh and then president clinton said it would stagnate uh business it would be bad for business well i my 

125.92 134.28 A: philosophy was this if you can't afford to be in business you shouldn't be in a bus- you can't afford to pay your workers a mi- a a decent wage well you don't deserve to be in business 

133.97 140.31 B: yeah that's that's just crazy and i'm a i'm actually uh uh laid off right now from the airline business and 

134.30 135.38 A: uh i mean 

139.13 142.99 A: oh real- oh god there's been so many cutbacks to airline industry it's unreal 

142.15 152.25 B: it's horrible and i i'm looking for work but i've seen jobs offer for like six dollars and seventy five cents an hour that's the lowest i've seen so i thought that the minimum wage was higher 

143.30 144.31 A: i know 

150.46 159.18 A: really right no i i i guess it i thought it was i thought it was too i thought they raised it but i i i guess i'm u- u- a lot of pressure i don't 

158.88 164.07 B: yeah well i i haven't seen any jobs listed as that low but uh my goodness 

160.58 161.37 A: (( know )) 

163.88 177.66 A: well i mean look at look at people who work in the hospitality industry like the bartenders i'm sitting in a a a in a this particular establishment right at at this time on my cell phone and actually what time it's my watch dog gone 

172.77 173.69 B: mhm 

176.37 178.80 B: well it must be five thirty there 

177.66 180.87 A: (( it yeah and i got a i but um )) 

181.63 188.43 A: uh [sigh] out here they pay two thirteen an hour two dollars and thirteen cents an hour but they 

187.09 189.26 B: oh for like bartending jobs 

188.91 202.49 A: like well eh eh anything restaurants anything like that but exactly exactly and depending like if you were in las vegas either you can walk away with easily a thousand dollars a a week depending on you know depending on the out there 

191.42 193.78 B: right where they rely on tips 

201.72 204.00 B: yeah that's true that's true 

202.97 209.08 A: but uh and there's clubs especially out here it's like they just opened up a new place here uh last week 

209.33 220.50 A: and their catering was this woman uh opened up she's had a couple of other clubs here in tampa but uh she is catering to the hockey and the uh n._f._l. players 

220.39 229.55 A: in out here and it's gonna be a five hundred dollar membership to you know get in i mean and you buy like you buy a bottle it's like a hundred and sixty or a hundred and ninety five dollars a bottle 

229.57 243.75 A: i mean we're talking normal stuff you want the the supermarket and buy it for twenty five dollars but the others uh they're charging a hundred and ninety five dollars for a bo- you know it's a private used as a oh and it's very elegant you know i i been there but jeez i mean 

243.07 252.75 B: yeah i i just like really can't imagine and and out here i i can see now why so many people have tons of roommates not just one or two they have like five or six roommates 

251.17 258.87 A: right well now i- if you go up enough for example san francisco i mean rent is is is it's absurd up there 

255.49 256.89 B: oh my goodness 

257.97 259.12 B: it is 

258.79 268.80 A: and i've been there many many time and and and the problem is up there is this uh if you can even find a place uh then finding a job to be able to support it 

268.64 269.61 B: right 

268.84 279.14 A: that's a problem you know most people i i know a lot of people that work in san francisco but they they they live over in oakland or you know or surrounding areas you know uh 

275.89 277.20 B: right 

279.44 289.82 B: but then you'd have to deal with the commute and i know that they started charging more just to get across the bridge now and it's it's crazy up there in san francisco nobody could possibly live on the minimum wage there 

285.51 286.39 A: that right 

287.15 288.86 A: well 

289.71 291.22 A: no no no 

289.94 294.37 B: they need to raise it and they need to do do it soon like real soon 

294.11 301.03 A: i know i i lived at a house i had had a condo in l._a. but then i moved down to lafayette park place and i bought a house 

300.86 312.14 A: now this is i'm i'm single so but it was you know nice house two bedroom you know big enough for me but anyway uh my next door neighbors uh were chinese and they had eleven people living in that house 

312.25 320.64 A: and i think what was it about five of them worked uh and a couple yeah i came over a coup- couple of times and they couldn't believe if i lived there alone 

320.74 327.62 A: well yeah i did i mean it's like eleven people in that house i i i just can't i can't i can't fathom it you 

327.13 333.82 B: yeah i can't either but uh i do have a roommate and always while i was flying i did just out of convenience but 

333.22 335.40 A: (( know yeah y- y- y- y- )) 

333.80 342.37 B: out here i mean i feel forced to have one even if i didn't want one because of you know being out of work and if i'm gonna look at jobs that only pay this much i have to 

341.06 342.53 A: no it's ridiculous 

342.27 348.83 B: have to have a roommate but i wonder if it's already um i guess it's already in legislation or you know the g- mm 

343.54 346.01 A: right right 

347.98 352.62 A: [laughter] i i don't know well th- th- they had it it it before 

352.86 354.69 A: congress and um 

354.73 363.92 A: uh clinton wouldn't it came up when clinton was in was in office and he shot it down because he he said it'd be bad for small business 

363.96 366.91 A: because they couldn't afford to pay the the high 

366.76 377.87 A: what they wanted to do is raise it to seven and a quarter an hour in increm- increments over i think two years maybe it was three years i don't know but they claim it'd be bad for small business well hell 

374.27 375.26 B: oh 

377.70 388.93 A: most small businesses don't last more than two years anyway i mean the fallout rate's fifty percent anyway it's just like the marriage rate now th- th- that's fifty five percent [laughter] in divorce rate but uh it wouldn't if 

385.42 386.51 B: mhm 

388.95 390.96 A: the problem is not 

391.33 395.67 A: why i mean why well like o- o- okay closer to home in hawaii 

395.55 407.58 A: you know if you've ha- employed work uh more than twenty hours a week in hawaii you have to pay 'em uh you have to pay their benefits healthcare benefits so what they do in hawaii is 

404.32 405.16 B: (( mhm hm )) 

408.52 421.56 A: on the right for the state of hawaii all the healthcare benefits in hawaii so they have all their people many chickens they're worth nineteen hours a week as a part timer best they don't have to pay any kind of healthcare benefits 

421.13 422.64 B: that's horrible 

422.44 427.97 A: and they hire two people to do a forty hour job and that's how they get around it 

425.52 426.63 B: mhm 

427.35 432.47 B: yep and out here i see a lot of uh jobs listed at thirty seven hours 

432.30 434.56 A: well thirty seven is fair that's a forty hour 

432.59 434.31 B: so it's just under forty 

434.38 444.98 A: well yeah the thirty seven and a half hours is standard though that's a forty hour week 'cause you got uh lunch that's how they figured out you know that's that's a standard week though that's standard but now in hawaii it's nineteen hours 

444.78 450.19 A: and and 'cause if they go over twenty hours in hawaii they g- g- put you on a- all the benefits 

450.04 451.15 B: right 

450.51 453.49 A: so that's how they get around it up in h- but uh 

452.15 461.11 B: well they have to i think out here it has to it would have to be at least ten dollars an hour to even make four hundred a week and you still wouldn't i don't even know how people would pay their rent 

458.02 459.72 A: i know i know 

460.28 467.89 A: i know well see what i did i'm a i mean i lived eight years and i probably wised up i moved over to las vegas because nevada hasn't any stop any taxes 

467.79 478.65 A: and uh luck uh you open up a business uh you got a- i didn't afford i i got incorporated in nevada even being out here it doesn't matter uh and and uh it's 

475.03 476.00 B: mhm 

478.51 487.03 A: that's why i live in nevada and wyoming are the two best states to incorporate in used to be delaware but now uh now it's now it's those two states 

483.92 484.97 B: oh yeah 

486.84 491.92 B: yeah i grew up in maryland right next to the delaware border and i remember that about the mhm 

490.31 494.48 A: maryland you know i'm originally from philadelphia personally 

493.40 494.91 B: (( oh mhm )) 

494.73 495.84 A: (( but um )) 

495.87 496.43 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

497.15 504.92 A: no i don't understand that's ridiculous i mean yeah that's ridiculous i mean i mean five and a quarter i mean even if you worked forty hours and they say they say forty eight forty full hours [lipsmack] 

505.07 507.86 A: uh five you know fives in five 

508.36 509.71 A: (( uh eh it's ridiculous )) 

508.37 516.81 B: well you can't survive i mean you and and out here where the gas was over two dollars a a gallon for a long time so people couldn't even pay to go to a five dollar job 

512.63 515.06 A: i know it w- i know 

515.59 520.97 A: i know you keep 'em down the grass and i just gassed up today it was uh what did i pay today 

521.00 523.33 A: uh fi- oh a dollar forty five 

523.22 531.81 A: uh it's a dollar forty five now it's gotten back down it it was is a it's it was still pointed that it had nothing to do with the cost of anything it's just 

531.62 538.51 A: arbitrary that they just decided they're gonna raise it and then know what see yeah and look at foals like in mexico you 

538.28 547.18 A: i mean i used to live in san diego you go down to mexico it's premix you know one brand of gasoline that's controlled by the government one brand and they set the price 

546.96 559.33 A: and when i was down here like in nineteen eighty one check say i could buy i could gas up and i think it was forty nine cents or something like that a gallon but it's it's it's fixed anywhere you go interstate count- in the state of mexico it's fixed th- 

554.54 555.10 B: (( mm )) 

559.69 564.88 B: well they need to change that here too the minimum wage and the gas it just needs to all change 

560.34 561.28 A: (( but yeah )) 

561.77 562.48 A: but 

564.72 569.33 A: see they always local merchants they just run the prices up to whatever they want 

569.37 570.53 B: right 

569.94 575.92 A: and they have no controls over it they have no and you would think the governor of the state would step in and say no you can't 

576.20 584.86 A: you know gouge the people like this at at your whims and and and also the the the the the fuel companies can't just arbitrarily run the prices up at their whims 

584.69 598.76 A: what they th- with with this iraqi war starter they thought the prices were gonna go up and they would burn up all their all the fuel all the wells over there but it didn't happen so now they're starting to come back down but this is in anticipation of it going up that's not even in the uh uh and it didn't even 

596.19 597.41 B: right 

599.23 599.95 A: (( happen ))
