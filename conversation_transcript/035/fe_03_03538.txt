0.05 1.29 B: helen 

2.79 3.82 B: (( hello )) 

3.03 4.56 A: (( [noise] [noise] hi )) 

4.28 5.11 B: hi 

5.56 6.59 B: how are you 

5.60 7.62 A: i'm p- i'm peggy 

7.57 9.26 B: okay how you doing 

8.99 10.44 A: good 

9.64 10.91 B: [mn] okay 

10.99 15.15 B: um do you feel the five fifteen minimum wage is sufficient 

15.24 22.56 A: um it doesn't like it to me i've been retired for many years so i'm not really up on what would be 

22.16 23.51 B: (( [mn] [mn] okay )) 

22.97 24.29 A: adequate [noise] 

24.83 33.26 B: all right no i don't think it is because i think with prices and everything going up it's just it's set at too low of a price 

33.59 36.06 B: for people to really survive on 

36.19 37.15 A: (( mhm )) 

36.63 45.44 B: i mean you figure five fifteen but [mn] you know the average at at least for new york the average rent is like six seven hundred dollars a month 

44.81 46.79 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

45.54 55.12 B: and that's not saying if the person has children you know and other expenses i mean it's just it's it's really pocket change if you come to add it up 

49.02 50.52 A: right 

54.74 56.64 A: right and i think 

56.79 65.58 A: it looks like it comes to about two hundred a little over two hundred a week two four six that's like [mn] maybe nine hundred a month at the most 

60.73 61.73 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

64.65 68.18 B: [noise] and that's not even talking about after tax exactly 

65.61 67.51 A: before taxes [mn] 

68.59 70.97 B: but that i mean i think 

70.13 72.61 A: that's not enough to live [laughter] on [noise] 

71.93 77.91 B: mhm no they just i they really just need to raise it because it's not i mean 

75.85 78.39 A: mhm 

77.96 79.92 B: it's not practical 

80.24 87.64 B: i mean the majority if you even with rent you f- you figure i mean people are spending a good amount of money on rent a month 

88.93 90.84 B: it's just it's not 

89.17 92.95 A: [noise] right and if they have if they have children to support 

92.37 93.46 B: (( mhm )) 

93.87 95.02 A: (( i don't know )) 

94.47 99.60 B: [noise] clothing shelter i mean there's just so many things to consider 

99.40 108.91 A: [noise] [noise] but then you have to look at the employer [mn] side of it like uh fast food and stuff if they can afford that 

105.63 106.66 B: yeah 

107.60 113.13 B: [mn] but see it would be fine in fast food if it was that they were gonna make sure that their [mn] 

113.96 117.67 B: if fast food would offer um 

118.14 120.84 B: [lipsmack] would offer [lipsmack] benefits 

120.59 123.23 A: mhm [noise] mhm 

121.18 122.49 B: then it's fine 

122.68 136.16 B: you so to speak because at least you're getting the help and if there's at least you're getting paid for sick time and stuff like that but i think when you look at you're not getting paid for any of that i mean it just it doesn't make any sense because even with annual medicaid [mn] 

128.08 129.96 A: (( [noise] right )) 

136.11 142.18 B: a single individual cannot make more than nine hundred and sixty eight dollars to be eligible for medicaid 

141.87 142.84 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

142.21 156.37 B: [mn] and at least for here in new york if you're earning six hundred dollars transportation is gonna cost you maybe i think it's seventy dollars a month now for a metro card that's five seventy that's not talking about phone or any other expenses you have 

150.91 151.91 A: uh-huh 

155.92 156.95 A: right 

156.39 163.70 B: food so when it comes down to it when you look at the nine hundred and sixty eight dollars that's that's not enough to live on 

163.44 164.75 A: right 

163.84 166.22 B: i mean you just you you can't it's 

166.26 168.76 A: it's too bad they can't have um [mn] 

169.02 172.58 A: a minimum wage for people that are teenagers 

172.26 173.35 B: (( like mhm )) 

172.69 174.48 A: versus adults 

174.69 178.19 A: with the teenager living at home that would be plenty 

177.87 183.07 B: yeah but even with the teenagers because the teenagers [mn] they're only allowed to work 

183.15 186.25 B: a certain amount of hours until they get to a certain age 

186.05 187.27 A: mhm 

186.54 194.95 B: so and the way everything is set up now even in two family households [mn] it's requiring both family members to work 

194.80 196.02 A: mhm 

195.22 203.99 B: sometimes even more i mean you have people who are homeowners and you see them [mn] renting rooms because that's the only that they're gonna be able to make ends meet 

203.89 204.96 A: right 

204.29 206.76 B: [noise] so i mean [mn] [noise] 

206.71 210.50 A: what do you think would be a good minimum wage [noise] 

210.94 212.13 B: (( [mn] [noise] [sigh] hm )) 

212.17 214.56 B: i think with the cost of living [noise] [mn] 

212.36 213.12 A: (( [laughter] )) 

215.06 217.17 B: maybe seven 

217.94 219.95 B: seven dollars 

217.98 218.94 A: seven 

220.21 234.94 B: [noise] i mean it it's not a walk in a park but [mn] i think five fifteen is just extremely low i mean even if [mn] i mean you had a good suggestion even if they make it just [noise] for the teenagers to have the five fifteen and that's fine but for an adult 

225.66 227.36 A: (( [mn] [mn] right )) 

231.08 232.95 A: (( mhm )) 

234.91 239.37 B: especially an adult with children and a family to support 

237.69 238.72 A: (( [noise] )) 

239.49 245.33 B: five fifteen don't doesn't cut it i mean you have people on welfare trying to get off of welfare 

241.49 242.73 A: right 

245.07 248.41 A: mhm and we don't want people on welfare 

245.38 246.99 B: [mn] and you know 

248.02 251.16 B: [laughter] no it's understan- 

248.84 252.74 A: [noise] right [laughter] [noise] i mean if they if they don't have to be 

252.46 263.14 B: exactly but then at the same token i mean i'm all for them not being on welfare but at the same token if an individual is gonna spend thirty five to forty hours a week at a job 

263.58 266.22 A: and then pay a babysitter and 

263.86 265.01 B: the minimum 

265.31 278.54 B: [mn] exactly 'cause um for my son i know i pay [mn] the the [sigh] the the wage to pay for a a small child is a hundred the most a childcare [noise] provider someone that takes care of them in at home 

266.25 267.66 A: yeah 

278.45 288.18 B: if they have a license it's a hundred and thirty five dollars [mn] so that's five forty a month that's why i say that that you know that minimum wage amount is just not 

281.37 282.41 A: wow 

283.87 284.83 A: uh-huh 

287.94 288.99 A: right 

288.57 293.83 B: it's not really realistic because if i have to pay a hundred and [mn] 

294.19 296.95 B: you would say if i have to pay 

297.81 301.91 B: [lipsmack] that's five forty a month for childcare my rent is six thirty five 

301.74 302.92 A: mhm 

302.15 304.56 B: you see where the nine hundred went 

304.45 306.81 A: yeah yeah 

304.87 305.98 B: it's gone 

306.84 308.30 A: nothing to live on 

306.85 307.83 B: (( you know [mn] )) 

309.71 311.31 B: (( [laughter] so i mean )) 

310.10 313.01 A: [laughter] you gotta buy food right [laughter] 

311.44 319.62 B: [mn] exactly and and see i didn't even talk about food and i still haven't even mentioned diapers you know 'cause he's still in in in 

316.85 318.14 A: yeah 

318.89 322.12 A: and medical bills and when you 

320.12 331.00 B: exactly and that kills you 'cause you know the medical i mean [mn] especially when you have no health insurance i mean the price can range from forty to two hundred dollars just for the doctor to to look at you 

322.17 323.01 A: (( [noise] )) 

325.70 327.18 A: mhm 

330.95 332.02 A: right 

331.16 335.04 B: 'cause we're not talking about when they start ranging up all those prices and everything 

334.66 336.30 A: mhm 

335.31 339.82 B: and i think if if they're not gonna put it [mn] put up the minimum wage 

339.95 345.72 B: then it should be set in such a way that everyone is entitled to health benefits 

345.69 346.79 A: (( right [noise] )) 

345.72 359.97 B: because like right now with this um sars you know they're afraid of the sars but you know if a person who has no medical insurance because people get disgusted too because when they go to the hospital the first thing is do you have medical insurance do you have medical insurance 

359.57 360.97 A: mhm 

360.16 362.00 B: and the people are turned away 

361.77 363.74 A: mhm 

362.07 369.25 B: so if the people are gonna be turned away like this you know many people have illnesses and just refuse to go to the doctor 

368.80 369.80 A: right 

369.69 374.59 B: so [noise] in essence they need to then come up with a realistic amount 

374.72 375.80 A: mhm 

374.99 378.31 B: [mn] where a person can actually survive and then they're just helping 

378.41 383.41 B: one class of you know of individuals they have to go around across the board 

382.80 383.90 A: (( [noise] right )) 

383.57 396.46 B: so not just um individuals with you know good paying jobs i mean you've got c._e._o.s making a hundred two hundred thousand dollars and and i'm not knocking it because maybe they have great expertise and you know they're good at what they do 

394.81 397.34 A: [noise] mhm right 

396.69 401.12 B: but everybody wants to everybody needs to survive and live as well 

400.87 402.73 A: that's right i agree 

402.42 406.04 B: you know and i think healthcare i i mean like europe 

406.07 407.63 B: you don't have to pay anything 

407.60 409.34 A: mhm 

408.15 409.83 B: it's supposed to be um 

410.02 413.21 B: you know they really believe everyone should be entitled to that 

413.69 417.86 A: so i'm wondering how people can get the minimum wage 

413.74 414.61 B: and i think 

417.99 418.92 A: up 

419.15 421.06 B: [sigh] well i think 

421.10 422.22 B: in the state of 

421.30 424.73 A: you know what i mean what can the average person do 

422.34 423.39 B: yeah 

424.54 434.67 B: [mn] well it's gonna take a lot because you know what even if e- even if people were to say well we're gonna go on strike against companies that don't offer health insurance [mn] that leaves 

434.67 440.04 B: [mn] the majority of the retail industry with no people to work 

437.58 439.07 A: mhm 

439.88 441.64 A: right 

440.19 441.14 B: um 

441.24 449.67 B: if there can be something like that because at the same token everybody's crying broke everybody's like oh money is tight money is tight [mn] you know and 

447.70 451.03 A: mhm especially now they're say that 

450.30 460.35 B: exactly yeah but ever since nine eleven everybody's being crying that it's broke [noise] [mn] but i think it needs to be assessed on the the the standard of living 'cause i know even here [noise] 

451.17 452.59 A: mhm 

453.17 454.65 A: right 

460.38 467.43 B: the average person in order to live kind of well in new york needs to make at least twenty do- twenty dollars an hour 

467.61 473.09 A: mhm yeah i've i've heard new york's expensive i'm in texas 

467.97 470.79 B: which is about forty hour [noise] 

472.19 474.23 B: (( [noise] [noise] okay [laughter] )) 

473.11 476.30 A: so it's more reasonable [noise] i think [laughter] or 

474.84 481.34 B: [noise] yeah and i had a friend up in texas and [mn] and you know she was like well the job market was hard over there as well 

481.11 482.14 A: uh-huh 

481.57 490.74 B: [mn] you know it wasn't exactly a walk in a park but you know if if you can give people decent money then people can come you know be able to provide 

482.44 483.48 A: (( right right [noise] )) 

490.51 491.47 A: mhm 

490.90 496.57 B: and i think that's what everybody is striving for and it shouldn't be at the case of [mn] that you have to work two and three jobs [noise] 

496.32 500.07 A: so the minimum wage [noise] is the same in our states 

499.97 502.44 B: i don't know i mean that's [mn] 

501.26 506.98 A: because like new york and california i take as being very high cost 

506.70 507.72 B: okay 

507.19 510.23 A: to live compared to other states 

508.16 511.97 B: (( mhm [mn] mm yeah well [mn] )) 

510.73 514.06 A: like housing in california is terrible 

513.63 514.60 B: oh 

514.56 515.68 A: you know 

515.34 520.49 B: yeah i think those places are just like the the harder ones 

516.54 518.31 A: and i just 

520.69 521.65 A: (( uh-huh )) 

521.32 523.71 B: you know in the sense of expenditures [noise] 

523.36 524.37 A: right 

523.90 529.58 B: but i really think they need to work on lowering it or doing something 

529.40 530.91 A: right 

529.66 534.16 B: to make it feasible across the board 'cause i don't think it should be the same if the 

534.25 541.25 B: if the rents and expenses aren't the same everywhere it should be nationwide but i think they make it nationwide 'cause it's just easier that way 

540.89 541.93 A: uh-huh 

541.42 547.07 B: instead of saying okay well this state is going to have this price and that state is gonna have that price [mn] it you know it kind of 

547.30 551.39 A: [mn] it would be be a lot of uh red tape and [noise] 

547.47 549.51 B: [mn] throws everything off the board 

550.70 551.80 B: mhm 

552.29 554.84 A: yeah that wouldn't work [laughter] 

554.21 556.02 B: no it's not gonna work 

556.54 560.81 B: so i think if they leave it across the board the same way then it's fine 

560.88 567.88 A: but then if if there's a minimum wage of say seven dollars maybe a lot of companies would go out of business the smaller ones 

567.88 569.16 B: (( mm [mn] )) 

569.20 571.43 A: fast food and small 

571.30 572.47 B: yeah 

572.05 575.88 A: small mom and pop shops and things like that 

575.72 581.89 B: [noise] but i think that they wouldn't be so [mn] because all right you take like mcdonalds 

581.67 582.62 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

581.97 591.85 B: you know they don't offer health insurance only to the managers [mn] but you figure you see mcdonalds being built up franchises going up all over 

591.59 592.77 A: mhm 

591.86 599.89 B: [mn] you know it might cost you because you have to offer your your your health your employers your employees some insurance [mn] but at the same token
