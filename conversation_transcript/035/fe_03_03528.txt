0.57 1.82 A: (( [lipsmack] hello )) 

1.49 3.03 B: (( hello )) 

3.19 4.77 A: (( [sigh] hello i'm barbara )) 

4.19 7.94 B: hi barbara i'm paul and i live near washington d._c. 

7.97 10.31 A: i live in western new york 

10.34 11.60 B: western europe 

11.49 15.33 A: in new y- yor- i mean western new york [sigh] [laughter] 

13.52 24.79 B: oh how nice yeah well i i guess our topic today is do you think the minimum wage going to five dollars or and some cents is sufficient that 

15.88 16.67 A: [sigh] 

24.58 25.50 A: uh-huh 

24.72 33.45 B: uh i don't know if you have any opinion on that but uh i guess my initial thought would be that it depends on er 

27.01 27.80 A: (( mm )) 

33.43 46.78 B: who is being placed in the position to have to make only that amount i mean for young people going to college you know i i guess it is but i'm afraid that when you talk minimum wage what that means is that most large 

38.98 39.79 A: yeah 

47.41 57.19 B: manufacturing companies feel that that's sufficient to pay their workers and i i i really don't think today that five dollars an hour can can pay anybody's 

57.44 60.04 B: [sigh] bills very well 

59.27 65.57 A: yes uh-huh who who is the one who on what basis was this amount established 

64.41 71.27 B: oh i see the good question uh it's um it it's it's really a congressional mandate it's something that congress 

71.28 77.75 B: passed to um as far as i understand the situation to uh make sure that um 

72.52 73.16 A: (( mhm )) 

77.75 88.16 B: the country has at least that minimum amount of money because if they er what happened in in times past when there was no minimum wage you had these huge 

88.90 99.43 B: companies in especially in new york city that were making clothing and so forth that would have basically sweatshops where people would be making pennies uh an hour 

95.72 96.65 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

98.17 99.06 A: uh-huh 

99.34 107.09 B: and they were still willing to do it because they immigrated from overseas and didn't make any money over there and so here they came to america but we [sigh] 

105.30 106.15 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

107.07 116.02 B: we just think that that's not fair and when the unions began developing in this country they were the ones behind it that really said oh no no no no 

113.55 114.65 A: mhm 

115.50 118.68 A: yeah well i see that um it just isn't uh [sigh] 

119.36 125.32 A: uh like you said fair um although because i i'm a foreigner and mm 

120.93 122.37 B: yeah 

124.95 126.82 B: yeah where are you from 

125.62 127.43 A: i'm i'm polish 

127.22 128.82 B: really 

127.62 132.13 A: yes and i i live in in in in the u._s._a. though and for two years 

131.84 133.18 B: yeah 

132.56 136.14 A: those who are [sigh] but we in poland we do have [lipsmack] 

136.62 141.49 A: the same type of thing a minimum as well although obviously it's much much lower 

138.99 139.97 B: right 

141.59 142.68 A: because i'm a i'm 

141.59 143.60 B: lower than five dollars yeah 

142.98 149.00 A: um the americans tend to to have to to earn better money than poles but [sigh] but uh 

147.07 148.48 B: right 

149.16 161.40 A: um you know and we're happy with that although i d- i did not see that in poland people were terribly attached to this idea that it was i think the case that 

161.43 165.05 A: you could be paid less than that than this the minimum wage 

164.34 172.00 B: [lipsmack] oh well the truth is here too i think we can less than that in certain jobs i know waitresses and waiters 

165.23 167.76 A: but i i maybe wrong i know how 

171.82 172.94 A: oh yeah 

172.29 178.48 B: i think they don't make anywhere near that amount but they get their tips you know yeah 

175.52 183.99 A: they get their tips right mhm but um like you said you know we we do have that and other countries have none 

183.70 185.70 B: right 

184.37 186.20 A: so i guess we should feel

241.89 243.64 B: well you can't do that no 

243.85 252.21 B: no no no no go back to poland yeah of course of course i was just studying poland a little bit last night i was 

245.61 249.16 A: [laughter] we would like to yeah we like the space 

252.12 259.86 B: preparing a paper for um [lipsmack] uh the events that occurred uh in september of nineteen thirty nine 

259.47 260.61 A: mhm 

260.07 267.37 B: and those that's the very important month for the beginning of the war and uh germany's invasion into uh poland yeah [lipsmack] 

263.55 264.96 A: yes mhm 

265.93 266.80 A: (( mhm hm )) 

267.42 274.62 B: but anyway i i think the minimum wage question is a good one but i i my opinion is that 

274.57 287.39 B: i'd like to be able to see all of the world get a better income because we must i think have some equality in wealth in this world or otherwise we're going to continue to have problems 

277.20 277.93 A: yeah 

284.86 286.00 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

287.57 289.75 B: i think one of the reasons we are 

289.65 291.63 B: having fighting wars is 

291.63 302.87 B: it's simply because of monetary issues and uh the people look at us in america some times and they say oh my my they just they don't care about anybody else they just make their money and 

294.13 294.99 A: mhm 

302.34 303.25 A: mhm 

302.88 306.72 B: get fat and eat hamburgers and that's all they do 

305.97 307.45 A: mhm 

306.96 319.13 B: and i agree i think there is an element of that in this country i mean i think it's a good country in many many ways but it's there is a a certain indifference i think to the population of the world uh uh you know in general so 

311.80 313.15 A: yes mhm 

318.43 326.04 A: i think it is it's just a trend which always is there and it has to be if we have it right we you know if we have it comfortable 

321.91 323.86 B: yeah 

325.25 327.01 B: to have it comfortable 

326.30 333.58 A: it's pretty hard to to be concerned with with things outside especially that america's such a huge place and you also have 

328.37 330.16 B: right 

332.05 333.85 B: right 

333.87 340.03 A: you know oceans and seas around you and um it's not very often that people travel that much 

336.05 337.50 B: yeah 

339.29 343.57 B: that's true though are you happy with america did you like it 

340.14 340.92 A: [sigh] 

342.09 345.73 A: (( um you know there's a lot of wonderful things about america )) 

345.02 346.84 B: and also other things 

346.45 358.06 A: and also other things [laughter] but it's it's just e- every place is like that i can't europe is obviously very very full of of um things which are so old 

347.19 349.69 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

350.82 353.31 B: yeah 

353.97 355.82 B: right 

357.68 358.79 B: (( yeah uh )) 

358.40 362.27 A: and um it's obvious obvious when you come here that um 

362.38 367.35 A: this isn't the place here but at the same time over here people are so much more practical and efficient 

366.54 367.87 B: (( true true )) 

368.23 369.11 A: (( you know mhm )) 

368.50 375.37 B: well were you uh not to be personal i'm just curious are were you a convert to uh protestantism from catholicism 

374.76 376.48 A: uh well um er 

377.23 387.90 A: i i believe in i considered myself a christian for a period of time in my in my youth and then and then um because er the roman catholic church in in poland is 

380.51 382.11 B: got ya got ya got ya 

388.19 394.38 A: um i i don't even know if it compares to the ca- catholic church here but anyhow it was just very um i mean 

394.51 396.82 A: it kind of put me off christianity 

396.17 397.60 B: right right 

397.01 401.68 A: and so it took took the whole new approach for me to um 

399.86 404.69 B: mhm [lipsmack] ah that's wonderful oh yeah 

402.37 405.75 A: to to just r- regain this idea 

405.25 407.53 B: yeah 

405.84 407.88 A: so i'm i'm pretty glad [sigh] 

408.29 409.30 A: and um 

408.97 412.10 B: well excellent excellent excellent 

410.06 413.51 A: yeah an- and i i can hear that you're doing some interesting things too 

413.13 419.60 B: well yes i was a airforce fellow for twenty eight years i retired from the airforce and now i'm teaching school 

419.61 427.98 B: at the uh it's called the national defense university and um [lipsmack] and uh we teach uh senior officers uh 

423.36 424.14 A: uh-huh 

428.02 429.21 B: um 

429.14 441.11 B: many many things history and and and international commerce and uh in- industrial development so that when they become very very senior officers they can uh [lipsmack] 

434.16 434.89 A: uh-huh 

441.04 447.02 B: uh have abilities that that they didn't really probably pick up as they were growing in their career because 

447.09 460.75 B: uh when you become very senior in the military you suddenly then have to switch to become er very tied to the industrial complex and in- inter- -national you know diplomacy and things like that and and some of them are not prepared for that 

455.33 456.40 A: okay 

457.91 458.87 A: uh-huh 

460.43 461.45 A: okay 

460.76 464.81 B: so they have a school set up just to kind of make you smarter a little bit or some 

464.09 468.28 A: that's clever so you have people uh what ages of 

465.13 466.94 B: yeah 

467.65 470.63 B: uh they're almost all in their 

470.70 480.39 B: uh late thirties and forties yeah yeah so it's right here in washington d._c. i hope you got to washington 

474.52 476.57 A: okay mhm 

478.11 478.89 A: oh 

479.86 487.33 A: i got it yeah it's it's very nice it's nice i mean you have some [sigh] obviously i won't talk about your traffic [noise] but [noise] 

480.82 483.30 B: good it's nice 

486.89 488.71 B: yeah terrible traffic 

488.03 490.69 A: [laughter] yeah
