28.45 30.28 A: oh yes [noise] 

29.30 33.26 B: yeah we got hammered the other day that's why they haven't been able to get in touch with me 

33.00 38.49 A: oh okay [mn] yeah well i was [mn] wondering because you know in different parts of the [mn] 

38.56 44.65 A: uh you know the united states different states i i think [mn] is minimum wage straight across the board 

44.82 47.34 B: ay uh it's five fifteen here too 

48.01 50.17 A: well i guess it is here i'm in texas 

49.13 63.95 B: yeah yeah yeah it probably is i'm sure it's i i'm sure it's straight across the board you know but it's my my son is seventeen and that's what he usually gets paid when he works anywhere you know and it's not you know it's it's not it's just not enough it's not enough to do anything with 

53.61 54.90 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

63.35 65.76 A: no it's not [mn] and

67.62 73.43 A: yeah i don't either [mn] but i know in some states that the cost of living's higher also [mn] 

72.95 79.35 B: oh yeah especially you know i know it is in texas because my dad just moved there he moved their last year he moved to longview

86.00 88.00 A: [mn] right right 

87.13 98.55 B: you know so i mean it it's [mn] it yeah i mean it's ridiculous it's ridiculous to ask somebody to try to live on that that's probably why a lot of people that have minimum wage jobs have several jobs 

97.80 103.03 A: [mn] [mn] well and and probably a lot of it's too why so many people are on welfare 

102.67 103.90 B: yeah that's true 

103.44 107.40 A: you know because they try to go out and get a job and they can't make it on that 

107.64 115.22 A: so i guess they figure why work you know when i can get food stamps and housing and you know 

110.05 110.84 B: yeah 

115.20 124.58 B: yeah and dependent on how what the size of their family is too you know the minimum wa- it's not gonna take care of that and they're gonna have to file you know for welfare or some kind of help anyway 

118.20 119.66 A: (( [noise] right )) 

124.29 125.31 A: right 

124.95 129.28 B: so [mn] a i it it's comical it's really comical

135.34 137.43 A: you must not be a mystery shopper okay 

136.56 139.01 B: no i don't even think i know what that is [laughter] [mn] 

138.61 145.07 A: [mn] oh okay [laughter] well that's okay i won't go into that we better stay on our topic 

144.31 145.94 B: (( okay yeah )) 

145.34 146.40 A: um 

146.77 151.27 A: [lipsmack] it's i don't know what else to say about minimum wage except it stinks 

149.85 152.49 B: (( except for it's not enough it stinks [mn] i don't )) 

151.38 153.64 A: yeah it's not enough 

154.29 157.78 A: how do they expect you to talk about minimum wage for ten minutes [mn] 

158.01 160.17 B: know i really i i don't know 

160.43 169.07 B: [mn] i don't know how they expect you to talk about some of these things for ten minutes but [noise] you know i'm i'm m- my sister told me to do this because i'm very opinionated you know 

168.72 169.76 A: (( [noise] [noise] really )) 

170.13 175.03 B: yeah and it's [sigh] but i [mn] i don't know how you're supposed to stay on topic for that long 

175.07 176.20 A: (( [mn] yeah [mn] [mn] )) 

175.26 188.48 B: you know it's just a matter of opinion do you do you agree or do you not agree no i don't agree as a matter of fact i think it should be you know i- in order for anybody to live on anything it should be you know at least seven dollars and something an hour 

187.98 190.59 A: at least at the very least 

189.67 192.84 B: you know i mean that would at least benefit somebody 

192.60 194.85 A: yeah [mn] because if you figure 

193.58 203.12 B: you know i mean i'm not talking about kids or anything like that that are just out working part time while they're going to school or something that's that's totally different you know they got parents to support 'em and everything else 

198.72 200.52 A: [mn] r- right 

202.90 203.95 A: yeah 

203.18 217.13 B: but you know some of these people that don't have good educations and granted that's their fault you know that's all they can do is go somewhere and you know flip burgers at mcdonalds or whatever and they're not gonna pay 'em anymore than minimum wage but [mn] you know at least give 'em something to live on 

217.04 219.59 A: [mn] [noise] exactly i agree 

219.41 221.20 B: (( [noise] you know [mn] i i [mn] )) 

219.76 221.71 A: 'cause it's it's not cheap [mn] 

221.35 226.26 B: no it's not and everything go- you know everything keeps going up and going up and going up you know 

226.21 229.52 A: yeah and minimum wage doesn't seem like it goes up very often 

228.77 242.95 B: [mn] it it doesn't go up enough anyway because i can remember yeah i'm thirty eight okay and i can remember when i first started working i was sixteen and mini- minimum wage for a waitress was like two dollars and eighty nine cents an hour 

233.51 234.61 A: (( [mn] [noise] uh-huh )) 

242.34 243.91 A: (( r- right [mn] )) 

242.97 247.91 B: and i think minimum wage for a waitress is just little over three now 

247.64 249.32 A: oh that's it 

248.69 249.73 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

249.65 264.58 B: for a wai- because because they get tips right and i think when i started and minimum wage was like three dollars and something an hour if y- you know if you weren't waiting tables and i mean you're talking [mn] y- you know you're talking more than you know twenty years ago 

249.75 254.13 A: because they get tips but [noise] yeah but tips [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

264.28 266.14 A: right right [noise] 

265.15 275.51 B: you're talking twenty two years ago three dollars and something and they've increased it i don't even think they've increased it two dollars because i want to say it was like three seventy five or something like that when i first started working 

274.73 276.72 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

275.73 281.83 B: and over a twenty two year period of time you know they haven't even increased it two dollars what is wrong 

281.20 283.55 A: [noise] [mn] y- i know there is something wrong 

282.97 284.70 B: yeah there is something wrong 

284.84 287.30 A: because these companies are making money 

287.64 293.02 A: and why do they figure y- you know how they [mn] i [mn] do we ever get to vote on this 

292.82 296.07 B: i don't think so i think it's just something that the government decides 

296.25 297.78 B: uh it's not a 

297.96 301.44 B: [mn] i- it's not something that's open to the public 

298.91 300.45 A: it couldn't be us 

301.31 303.42 A: yeah or it would be higher 

302.09 305.16 B: no if if it was it would probably be different 

304.54 307.32 A: right it would be a lot higher i'm quite sure 

306.13 307.02 B: right 

307.37 312.19 A: [mn] yeah i'm [noise] thirty eight also [laughter] i wonder if they choose you by your age 

309.73 310.30 B: (( [mn] )) 

311.66 313.53 B: i don't know there's a 

312.28 315.86 A: to match you up i don't remember if i if i had to put my birth date [noise] 

316.15 330.11 B: i can't remember either it's been it it's been a while since i signed up for it you know but it's [mn] an- and i've had a phone call you know i could see where i've had a phone call just about every day but i either haven't been here or what with the mess that's gone on here it's [mn] it it's been kinda chaotic [mn] 

320.65 322.43 A: yeah me too [noise] [noise] 

329.47 332.60 A: [mn] mhm ho- how did you know you had a phone call 

332.70 335.91 B: uh just by the number that comes across my caller i. d.

350.79 352.65 A: oh okay [noise] 

354.55 359.50 A: okay yeah [sigh] well i'm glad they called us 

359.54 360.68 B: oh i am too 

360.75 373.81 B: even though it's a you know [noise] [mn] i don't know an awkward an awkward topic i can't imagine anybody agreeing with it it's like do you think it's sufficient well yeah i'm gonna say it's sufficient not [mn] 

363.63 364.70 A: right 

368.93 370.86 A: [mn] [noise] [noise] no i can't 

372.16 376.26 A: [mn] right [mn] i don't think anyone's gonna say it's sufficient 

375.56 378.54 B: no it's not it's not and never has been 

376.47 377.83 A: you know unless 

378.33 381.83 A: [mn] unless it's one of the law makers that that decides on it [laughter] 

381.88 383.98 A: and i don't think they would doing this 

383.50 393.53 B: no they should try living on minimum wage if that's the case now if they're the ones that pick and choose how to you know how to decide what minimum wage should be [mn] then they need to try living on it 

385.78 387.47 A: it exactly 

392.97 395.03 A: [noise] exactly i agree

398.48 399.82 A: oh no 

398.97 400.45 B: i mean there's no way 

400.31 402.13 A: not at all [noise] [noise] 

400.44 406.31 B: that's why a lot of places around here i know the minimum wage is five fifteen but a lot of places around here 

406.18 415.45 B: they'll pay like five and a quarter which isn't you know that's a dime more five fifty an hour five seventy five an hour you know and i think they do that simply because 

411.97 413.60 A: (( [mn] mhm [mn] )) 

415.51 418.03 B: you know they know that it's ridiculous 

417.93 419.10 A: right 

419.67 420.82 A: i agree 

419.78 428.10 B: but they want they don't wanna go too much over because then they'll be afraid that they'll increase it you know all all across the board so [mn] i don't i don't know 

427.85 430.98 A: well i wish they would increase it all across the board 

429.98 437.08 B: well they need to either that or whoever's deciding how much these people are getting paid need to get out and and like i said try to live on that [noise] yup

443.92 448.31 A: [mn] [mn] [mn] yeah but you know they'll never get out there to do it so 

448.44 453.12 A: i don't know what anybody else can do to change it just the general public [mn] 

452.89 456.10 B: i don't know either unless they put it to pub- public referendum 

456.37 457.92 A: yeah but i don't
