2.01 4.02 B: hi this is stacey 

3.84 5.14 A: how are you 

4.88 6.58 B: good how are you 

6.09 11.86 A: i'm doing good but i wouldn't be doing good if i made minimum wage i tell you that 

7.75 8.66 B: good 

10.35 14.95 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] i didn't know it was five fifteen [laughter] )) 

13.51 23.85 A: [laughter] and and and when they said it i said to myself please don't let it still be five fifteen i think it's been that way for like five years or so 

19.15 20.22 B: [laughter] 

22.69 33.32 B: yes i agree with you i think it has been five fifteen i actually thought it had been raised to five thirty five but [laughter] but i think it's been five fifteen for quite a few years [laughter] 

32.51 41.25 A: a a long time a very how can anyone live off of five fifteen and to show you how ridiculous it is when i was in 

37.36 38.26 B: i 

38.87 39.72 B: [laughter] 

41.51 47.48 A: high school when i was fifteen i got my first job i'm thirty two now so we're looking at seventeen years ago 

47.31 59.88 A: minimum wage was three thirty five you mean to tell me in seventeen years the cost of living has only go- gone up a dollar eighty i don't think so [laughter] 

49.77 50.77 B: yeah 

56.87 57.86 B: [laughter] 

57.91 69.38 B: [laughter] [laughter] i i completely agree well it's it's funny because i used to recruit people for a temporary agency that used to be my job and um i can recall 

69.36 81.63 B: uh you know that the minimum wage at that time this was about four years ago was five fifteen and uh i can remember people saying hey i make more on unemployment why am i gonna come and take this job [laughter] 

74.41 75.38 A: right 

80.71 94.59 A: exactly exa- e- that's absolutely correct that's true even on unemployment i mean five fifteen that's not even worth getting up to to go to work for especially if you have a family 

84.62 85.43 B: (( yeah )) 

90.80 92.29 B: [laughter] 

94.28 101.56 B: yes and i mean it not that if you work forty hours a week that's um two hundred [laughter] dollars before taxes 

100.96 114.43 A: exactly who could live off of that the only person i could see living off of that would be a fifteen or a sixteen year old who lives at home and has no bills and that's just mall money [laughter] 

107.83 108.50 B: [laughter] 

112.73 120.81 B: [laughter] that's [laughter] that's right because i i i can't imagine i mean that's eight hundred dollars a month there's no way that anybody could live off of that 

114.68 115.51 A: [laughter] 

120.35 135.20 A: and e- even if you was married and your spouse was making that that's sixteen hundred dollars a month who could uh what where that's you know what that's why there's a lot of people who live in what they call overcrowding situation 

126.68 127.79 B: mhm 

134.41 136.08 B: yeah yeah 

134.97 147.39 A: it'll be like a three bedroom apartment with like three families in it because yeah because how could you how could you afford your own single occupancy five fifteen that's ridiculous 

137.71 138.88 B: yeah 

139.23 140.57 B: exactly 

147.22 149.02 B: i know well um 

149.04 157.51 B: (( [lipsmack] uh oh what was i going to say i was going to say something about [laughter] but i forgot what i was going to say um [lipsmack] uh )) 

152.69 154.05 A: [laughter] 

157.92 160.72 B: oh goodness i can't remember [laughter] 

159.96 171.24 A: well maybe you'll remember it but but but but think about this i'm i'm sitting here thinking and you know what's it what makes it even worse what's like the salt in the wound think about it 

171.13 179.37 A: if you had a minimum wage job you're making five fifteen an hour nine out of ten you're in a job with no benefits 

179.19 181.88 B: yeah that's true that's true 

179.37 180.97 A: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

180.74 186.14 A: 'cause a lot of times we'll take jobs that may pay less than what we desire 

185.93 199.13 A: but we can get the benefits health and dental and stuff we'll weigh it out so you can say okay well i do i can afford to get sick at least you know my children can go to the doctor 

186.10 187.00 B: yeah 

188.91 189.82 B: yeah 

196.79 198.04 B: yeah 

198.91 201.54 A: but most jobs at minimum wage 

201.55 208.25 A: they're they're like [mn] below entry level they're like cashier job they have no benefits 

206.73 207.51 B: yeah 

207.94 219.51 B: i and i i remember now what i was going to say was that um i think that the minimum wage law we still need benefits those employers because look at all they're getting for five fifteen an hour 

219.03 220.95 A: exactly 

220.04 225.60 B: you know they're making millions of dollars a year and they got people working for them for five fifteen [laughter] 

225.43 228.81 A: (( exactly ex- exactly )) 

226.91 232.46 B: yeah i mean it's it's it's not a law that protects the employees by any means 

232.05 236.75 A: exactly it's it definitely benefits the employer completely 

232.88 234.50 B: i i mean i can't 

235.68 236.76 B: yeah 

237.29 240.26 A: that's terrible and then those jo- 

237.38 238.37 B: (( to to )) 

238.67 239.98 B: yeah 'cause i mean 

240.30 241.51 A: (( go ahead )) 

241.13 255.01 B: oh i was just gonna say i mean no one you know it it only does benefit the employer because it doesn't benefit the employee um because no one in their right mind would take a job for under five fifteen i would think so there's no benefit to the employee 

251.81 255.64 A: exactly unless they're working illegally 

255.32 257.36 B: yeah exactly [laughter] well i think 

256.38 259.94 A: exactly exactly and then what 

257.77 260.38 B: [laughter] yeah and that's why there is 

260.07 262.35 A: and then on top of everything 

262.18 269.36 A: i mean it's like another slap in the face the jobs that pay the lowest are the m- you have to put the most effort into 

269.20 281.63 A: you know those are those like really laborious jobs janitor real you know those are the jobs that you really have to roll up your sleeves and get into the dirt you know the the 

269.98 271.09 B: yeah 

272.80 273.98 B: yeah 

280.62 282.00 B: yeah you're right 

281.69 285.49 A: the more people make the less i mean there may be 

285.28 295.20 A: a an intellectual you know that there might be a lot of intellectual and educational stuff you have to put into your job i'm not saying if you're a c._e._o. you're not doing anything 

295.04 304.92 A: but at the end of the day it's your mind that's tired it's not that your back is hurting and then you can't and then you can't even go see the doctor about your back that's hurting 

295.25 296.21 B: right 

298.69 301.18 B: right that's right 

304.14 315.10 B: [laughter] [laughter] that's right [laughter] and typically those [laughter] typically those positions too they don't get 

305.11 307.90 A: (( [laughter] you )) 

308.62 311.61 A: can't [laughter] that's awful 

314.95 325.81 B: you know the not only do they not get benefits but they really don't get any respect either you know people say oh she's just a waitress or she's just you know making minimum wage and um you know i mean they don't 

319.31 320.47 A: right 

320.77 322.85 A: exactly 

325.66 331.28 B: they don't get anything and they don't even really get self respect if people are going to make derogatory comments about 'em 

330.97 339.83 A: exactly that's why i've always made i've always felt the personal obligation to when i'm in restaurants to always be 

339.67 346.33 A: awfully polite to the waiters and the waitresses aside from the fact that i don't want my food spat in 

342.61 343.80 B: yeah 

345.88 348.97 B: but right [laughter] 

346.16 359.66 A: but i don't you know i mean let me give them a break for the day because i know they've ran across all type a arrogance and nastiness and like you're saying just because they make that much you know people 

349.81 350.92 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

353.63 354.82 B: yeah 

359.45 366.73 A: they they equate how much respect they give you according to how much they think you're worth and they only look at how much you're worth 

364.95 366.21 B: right 

366.56 381.03 A: or according to how much you're making now but your worth has nothing to do with what your cu- your current position one has nothing to do with the other someday you may be asking that person for a job [laughter] 

368.28 369.44 B: that's right 

373.97 375.11 B: that's right 

375.67 376.84 B: that's right 

378.93 386.39 B: yeah that's [laughter] that's right and i mean someone may be taking that minimum wage job just as a second job to support their family so 

386.19 397.98 B: you you know i mean they could be you know they could be some other very important job you know or what people perceive as an important job during the day but at night they could be doing that minimum wage job for extra money 

386.37 387.32 A: right 

393.67 395.20 A: mhm 

397.47 409.85 A: exactly that's true too it's not so it's not right to so quickly judge a person just by what they're doing exactly like you said that could be a second job somebody could be going to school pulling off two 

406.99 407.92 B: yeah 

408.74 409.65 B: yeah 

409.64 420.27 A: two jobs because they need flexibility and they they the flexibility can only be found in these low paying jobs where they're in the service sector right maybe they 

417.69 418.79 B: (( that's right )) 

420.12 423.19 A: like me for example i gave up a career 

423.06 424.83 A: to go back to school 

424.71 438.76 A: you know so i wasn't collecting unemployment because i was a bum and i got fired [laughter] it was actually it was actually all planned and my supervisor said don't quit i'll hook you up 

424.75 425.82 B: mhm 

429.98 433.07 B: [laughter] right [laughter] 

435.15 436.44 B: [laughter] 

438.57 444.92 A: and get you unemployment we'll we'll we'll write you off as as as um 

438.68 440.22 B: [laughter] 

441.64 443.44 B: [laughter] 

444.78 447.31 A: (( what what is it called when you're la- laid )) 

446.50 449.29 B: laid off yeah that's good 

447.10 461.95 A: off you'll get your ben- fine you'll you'll get your benefit and you'll still be able to use the job as a reference but you know pe- people don't always know the whole story behind everything and they wanna draw their own conclusion which is sad [laughter] 

450.87 451.79 B: [laughter] 

454.07 454.99 B: yeah 

459.81 470.88 B: yeah well you know um [laughter] that's something else too about minimum wage is that i live in virginia and virginia you can't get a one bedroom apartment for under twelve hundred dollars a month 

470.89 476.31 A: wow wow uh that sounds like new york [laughter] 

471.89 473.32 B: yeah so like 

473.33 474.58 B: it it 

474.99 485.10 B: well and you know it's so expensive and so you know why should it be five fifteen here and then also five fifteen in missouri where you can get a mansion for twelve hundred dollars a month 

484.34 490.82 A: well exactly you're right about that i think that they they they use like those 

487.33 488.05 B: yeah 

490.60 500.19 A: very very rural areas when they take into consideration living standards where you can get apartments for five hundred two bedroom 

496.38 497.38 B: yeah 

500.08 509.85 A: furnished g- um gas and electricity and everything else included i wish i could get something with anything included [laughter] i don't have 

500.91 502.05 B: yeah 

505.88 507.43 B: [laughter] me too 

507.67 509.85 B: (( [laughter] yeah me too )) 

509.74 524.57 A: i have nothing included i moved from new york to new jersey i have to pay for my own heat [laughter] and hot water [laughter] i was like are you kidding me 'cause in new york that's inclusive you know where where are you at 

511.46 513.10 B: [laughter] me neither 

516.63 517.92 B: [laughter] 

518.27 519.67 B: [laughter] 

520.02 521.28 B: [laughter] 

522.02 527.40 B: oh yeah it's not included here [laughter] [laughter] in virginia in um 

524.47 526.13 A: (( where are you at )) 

526.56 528.56 A: (( oh you're in virgi- okay )) 

528.04 531.12 B: yeah yeah i'm like i'm right outside a d._c. 

530.92 533.22 A: oh okay yeah i have to 

531.72 534.07 B: yeah right near the pentagon yeah 

533.87 541.60 A: oh okay yeah i i have to pay for my own heat and hot water so every time i wash my hands i'm paying for that 

537.95 538.69 B: yeah 

540.82 542.89 B: (( me too i have to pay for it too [laughter] )) 

542.58 555.14 A: that's awful that's awful it's it's it but in new york it was never like that a- and that was in- included and the law was they had to give you heat from october fifteen to april fifteen 

543.87 545.23 B: yeah 

545.40 546.37 B: [laughter] 

548.75 549.81 B: yeah 

554.92 569.34 A: and even if the weather stayed below like uh i think sixty degrees after april fifteen they was obligated to continue to provide you with heat but now were yeah now were i'm at i've never had such a high 

555.07 556.09 B: oh 

564.96 566.27 B: oh wow 

568.45 569.60 B: [laughter] 

569.26 578.28 A: bill [laughter] in my life you know and five fifteen an hour it's not even it's not worth it that's for kids 

570.07 571.29 B: i know 

572.45 573.07 B: [laughter] 

574.82 575.95 B: no 

576.19 580.79 B: no you need to work five jobs at five fifteen an hour 

579.90 591.86 A: e- exactly exactly and then the thing about it is the ironic part is you're that at five fifteen an hour you'll work forty hours a week like you said make two hundred bucks 

581.07 583.05 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

591.69 599.89 A: then you'll try to go into the public aid office and say okay well look i'm working but can you at least just give me some food stamps and supplement and they'll t- 

598.24 599.95 B: (( [laughter] right ))
