3.77 4.84 B: hello 

4.49 5.77 A: hello 

5.70 6.51 B: (( hey )) 

6.45 7.64 A: um 

7.12 7.97 B: this 

8.14 15.19 A: i um uh this is the first time i've uh received one of these calls so i'm not too familiar with the procedure 

14.97 15.82 B: (( is chris )) 

15.73 19.53 A: uh have you um been with this outfit too long have you uh 

18.44 21.08 B: okay uh no my first one as well 

20.49 21.66 A: yeah 

21.70 25.77 A: well the subject they say is minimum wage 

25.13 26.40 B: right 

26.43 30.56 A: and uh uh whereabouts are uh what part of the country are you in 

30.16 31.91 B: washington d._c. 

31.34 34.75 A: oh and i'm in i'm in uh kansas city in missouri 

34.18 35.05 B: okay 

35.49 36.59 A: um 

36.85 42.18 A: well we're supposed to we're supposed to talk about the minimum wage for about i think eight or ten minutes 

41.57 42.41 B: okay 

42.99 44.31 A: um 

44.60 48.34 A: i haven't thought too much about it lately but um 

47.11 48.64 B: [laughter] 

49.09 53.87 A: i know it's quite uh a lot there's a lot of debate going on about it um 

53.27 56.58 B: yeah it hasn't it hasn't been a big focus of mine lately either 

57.04 66.18 A: 'cause there's been so many other things you know going on that uh have been tak- you know with this war in iraq and that that i don't think too many people have been talking about it 

65.57 67.70 B: (( that's probably true that's probably true )) 

66.67 67.87 A: um 

68.28 79.48 A: but uh as far as my opinion goes i don't know it it's one of those subjects you know i i think it'd nice for uh the minimum wage for a lot of people but then a lot of companies claim that uh 

79.54 90.87 A: if they raise the minimum wage they'd just have to maybe lay off a few people to make up for the difference so maybe it wouldn't be too beneficial but i don't know that that's kind of a hard topic for me i 

91.32 93.93 A: what do you think about that 

91.44 92.10 B: (( yeah )) 

92.27 93.10 B: well 

95.84 96.72 B: (( er uh )) 

96.94 104.61 B: [laughter] guess i don't know um it would seem that you know i think there are statistics that show that you know 

104.83 110.18 B: well generally speaking you know ten percent of the people in this country have ninety percent of the wealth 

110.15 111.24 A: yeah 

110.51 115.88 B: um so there are a lot of people who who struggle with with you know five dollars an hour 

115.98 118.37 B: um there are a lot of people who also 

119.18 124.50 B: you know won't take five dollars an hour there are a lot of people that would rather be on welfare than take five dollars an hour 

125.18 134.04 B: you know and i don't know if that is prevalent as it is in i don't know if it's as prevalent in kansas city as it is here in d._c. i mean i grew up in new york and now i live in d._c. 

134.27 135.63 B: and so [lipsmack] 

135.80 137.65 B: when you see a lot of people who 

137.61 145.99 B: you know don't have any money who are just out on the streets and things like that um i mean the person that i would be most concerned about in the scenario would be 

145.85 153.59 B: the honest you know working guy who really or or girl i guess in this day and age you have to say guy or girl and [laughter] um 

153.70 154.91 B: you know who 

155.26 163.64 B: you know is out there really trying to make it at four dollars and eighty five cents an hour now to that person a hike to five dollars an hour is a big deal 

163.69 174.15 B: it means a lot to you know a huge company say like ford or philip morris or something like that well you multiply that by you know a hundred thousand employees 

174.35 177.73 B: and now all of sudden you're talking about a big cut into profits 

178.21 179.17 A: mhm 

178.62 181.41 B: [lipsmack] so it really depends i mean i don't know 

181.05 182.05 A: (( [cough] [mn] mm )) 

181.43 184.31 B: how many other nations really 

184.76 192.79 B: have have come to a conclusion with with minimum wage whether or not they have it whether they'd whether or not they just let all of the 

192.84 197.54 B: the sort of wage agreements be dealt with between the employee and the worker 

198.05 204.17 A: [sigh] [mn] um i think uh like you said there might be a lot of people who 

204.11 215.29 A: uh are having a hard time making it on on a minimum wage so they might be better off you know they might a- actually get more in welfare than they would through minimum wage 

215.49 216.63 A: um 

216.72 228.21 A: i think the minimum wage uh benefits uh a- and the way our young people well see a lot of young people who just work part time t- to make extra money for going to school 

228.31 240.92 A: they might be able to get okay by on the minimum wage er where it's at right now i'm not exactly sure where it's at right now because it's changed uh d- do you know what they what the minimum wage is now per hour 

240.33 247.78 B: you know i d- i don't um in the in the recording it said it was five dollars but i would have thought i would have thought it was more than five but maybe 

244.39 245.82 A: (( [noise] yes )) 

247.71 252.88 A: yeah i think they said five or five something i remember the five figure but um 

248.20 248.99 B: (( they yeah )) 

252.35 255.22 B: certainly not more than six i can say that 

254.45 264.69 A: yeah i i know it's less than six but er uh for a young person who uh let's say a high school student working at a fast food place the minimum wage where it's at right now 

264.81 269.67 A: might be sufficient because they're not totally dependent on it it's just a 

268.96 269.92 B: (( that's true )) 

270.00 279.00 A: a s- you know a supplement to their income and if they raised it of course they would have a little more spending money for an extra britney spears c._d. maybe 

278.08 279.58 B: [laughter] 

279.76 286.52 A: b- uh so i don't think it'd be critical for people like that but for somebody who is 

280.77 281.34 B: (( [noise] )) 

286.70 299.69 A: maybe uh been unemployed uh or you know with the economy they might even be somebody who was making you know really good money at a company and now they just need something to to get by to pay their bills 

300.01 305.33 A: uh [cough] a increase in the minimum wage would probably help somebody like that um 

306.42 308.48 A: uh if somebody yeah [sigh] 

306.81 310.45 B: well you also you also wonder whether that whether that same 

310.40 322.16 B: you know those same two types of individuals that you just mentioned um in particular the person you know who's not who's not the high school kid who really is dependent on that money if you put that person in 

319.72 321.03 A: yeah 

322.12 325.78 B: you know in washington d._c. or in kansas city missouri 

326.01 334.03 B: or maybe you know in in billings montana you know that five dollars is going to have different weight in each one of the places 

332.78 339.07 A: well yeah that's true yeah because uh let's say you've got somebody who's maybe uh let's say you've got somebody who's uh 

339.20 351.80 A: uh a a married man with maybe only one kid and he's uh uh thirty years old and he doesn't have a great deal of education but he is making the minimum wage uh somewhere 

351.67 365.72 A: and uh he could probably get by like you said in a place like maybe i don't know maybe montana or maybe west virginia wherever the cost of living is cheaper he might be able to get along okay er you know and if and if his wife was working making the minimum wage 

365.94 370.25 A: this is all just theoretical of course they could probably get by 

370.44 380.34 A: uh er with a modest lifestyle but if those two people were each working and were er making the minimum wage in washington d._c. 

380.23 389.82 A: i just don't see how they could uh make a living at it so the minimum wage is probably more critical to some people in some parts of the country than others 

384.05 384.88 B: right 

389.26 390.30 B: that's true 

390.79 399.01 A: so that's why i'm i'm debating this now th- the companies as far as i know that are making profits now are making very good profits 

399.23 408.41 A: so the minimum wage maybe wouldn't hurt them now like mcdonalds though they- they're been in trouble here they've closed several hundred restaurants now they definitely probably wouldn't want to have to 

408.64 410.64 A: increase the minimum wage 

410.66 413.44 A: but the the thing i don't understand is um 

413.81 416.42 A: i i went to hardee's last week 

416.77 423.27 A: and they had one girl working behind the counter only and i think they had one guy 

423.28 425.28 A: cooking the food in back 

425.62 427.39 A: well um 

427.50 438.83 A: it seems to me that they had cut down to the b- bare minimum right there so even if they had to increase the minimum wage for that for those two people i don't think it would have a great impact 

438.40 439.29 B: okay 

439.19 440.29 A: i it 

439.35 443.67 B: well it also it also depends in um you know res- restaurants like uh 

443.56 444.82 A: yeah 

444.20 450.74 B: hardee's um your wendy's uh mcdonalds type places they use different uh matrix 

450.61 462.28 B: by which they calculate the time of day based on the amount of business that they have and then they staff accordingly so you wouldn't have a standard you wouldn't have a standard five person 

455.90 456.74 A: (( mm )) 

457.88 459.61 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah i definitely )) 

462.47 470.06 B: you know staffing you know at the h- hei- at the height of lunch and the height of dinner as you would at say maybe two in the afternoon or 

469.65 470.95 A: mhm 

470.12 472.28 B: you know ten o'clock at night 

471.92 483.75 A: well i was there it was you know around five or six o'clock in the evening which which i which i thought and there were there w- there were quite a few people you know ordering hamburgers but there weren't that many people eating 

475.65 477.31 B: oh wow well it 

481.41 482.26 B: yeah 

484.02 490.63 A: uh you know in the dining area uh i think their business maybe they'd rely on drive up a lot because 

489.80 490.71 B: okay 

490.47 504.02 A: there's always cars driving up so they might have had an extra person i can't remember if they had an extra person to handle the drive up or not but uh it used to be when i went in to a burger king or mcdonalds i don't eat fast food that often 

504.31 507.60 A: uh but when i used to go into those places there would be 

507.68 512.03 A: two three sometimes four people behind the counter 

512.42 517.05 A: plus another two or three or four you know in the back preparing the food 

516.44 518.26 B: right 

517.14 524.63 A: so i was a little surprised that they only had that one one girl up front there they usually have at least two so maybe there was a sickness or 

524.83 526.58 A: or something i don't know 

526.69 531.19 A: but on this minimum wage i suppose it depends on the company uh 

531.24 540.25 A: now you take like companies like general motors and general electric well they they they aren't going to be affected by this because uh you know there's they don't pay minimum wage 

540.94 545.30 A: but a co- but the fast food places i think they're the ones that probably 

545.42 552.81 A: you know hire the most people at minimum wage they're the ones that might be impacted and maybe some restaurants 

545.46 546.16 B: yeah 

552.56 562.61 B: yeah that's that's an interesting point and i was just going to make that point that i think that you know a term like minimum wage is usually associated with places like fast food restaurants 

562.22 563.41 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

562.69 568.50 B: you gotta wonder for companies as big as say you know your general motors your general electric um 

568.63 583.32 B: you know they have a number of different you know even the pack- the packages that they send out you know for if it's for g._e. if it's light bulbs or you know washing machines even the packaging the things like that i would assume that there's probably some people there on minimum wage 

577.59 580.03 A: (( yeah i always w- yeah )) 

581.73 596.43 A: yeah there probably are yeah yeah because you know you know like uh companies like general motors now or then they have cafeterias probably i don't know about the pl- plants here but a lot of companies will have large cafeterias now no doubt a lot of those people are working in the 

589.81 590.52 B: (( sure )) 

595.08 598.45 B: even the cleaning crews for the building and things like that 

597.50 599.89 A: yeah those people probably aren't making a
