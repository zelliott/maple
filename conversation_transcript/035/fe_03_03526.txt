0.38 2.15 B: (( [noise] hi i'm beth )) 

2.34 4.00 A: [noise] hi i'm jen 

3.82 9.91 B: hi jen [mn] um i really don't think it's enough money five dollars and fifteen cents 

10.25 15.49 B: [mn] i just personally don't think that's enough money at all [laughter] for minimum wage 

15.60 16.84 B: what do you think 

16.51 18.77 A: [noise] um i would tend to agree with that [noise] i 

18.88 20.39 B: i mean it 

19.09 25.42 A: think it should be a little more than th- i actually to be honest with you i didn't know what it was i i thought it was higher than that 

26.15 29.44 A: if you'd asked me what what minimum wage was i would have told you it was 

28.71 29.60 B: (( [sigh] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

29.65 30.79 A: six dollars yup 

30.27 36.97 B: [mn] [noise] really [noise] i think six dol- even six dollars would be not enough i mean when you have rent to pay 

37.05 43.47 B: [mn] i don't see how single people with children do it because there's just [mn] 

43.91 48.70 B: y- with if they're making minimum wage say working at mcdonalds or something 

48.70 60.69 B: five dollars and fifteen cents per hour forty hours a week that's just a little over two hundred dollars and you cannot find a place to rent for you're supposed to use what a quarter of your income for rent 

60.31 61.24 A: mhm 

60.91 66.62 B: you can't find a place to rent for two hundred dollars a month [laughter] 

64.86 66.02 A: no you can't 

66.79 70.42 A: although most people that start at minimum wage don't stay at minimum wage 

70.49 73.20 A: i mean if if you stay at a job longer than 

74.28 77.40 A: um you know a month you're gonna get a raise but 

76.67 78.41 B: [mn] well yeah usually 

78.57 84.89 B: but do do they give raises like that at um like mcdonalds and places like that 

83.51 84.95 A: i would assume they do 

85.11 86.09 B: okay 

85.53 87.01 A: (( i don't know i never worked there [laughter] [noise] )) 

86.68 88.96 B: oh well me either [laughter] that's why i asked 

89.09 90.31 B: i wasn't sure 

90.69 91.76 B: um 

92.74 95.45 B: [mn] i just i don't know wha- 

96.05 97.80 B: what do you think it should be 

98.68 105.41 A: [noise] um i i would say you know six six twenty five somewhere around there i think would be a um 

106.05 110.38 A: an adequate starting salary um especially for a teenager 

110.58 112.53 B: yeah 

111.25 113.85 A: yeah i think minimum wage maybe should be more 

114.17 117.55 A: um segregated [mn] into age and classes 

117.05 120.47 B: [mn] you know i didn't think of that but that would be a good idea 

120.15 121.11 A: right 

121.69 122.86 B: that would be 

121.89 125.60 A: oh i guess that wouldn't be fair either to the teenagers but 

125.83 127.42 A: yeah there's certainly um 

128.69 130.26 B: but 

128.88 131.09 A: (( there has to be something said for )) 

130.66 133.06 B: for experience life experience 

132.38 135.57 A: right exactly for age and life experience 

136.55 140.91 A: but yeah certainly there should be a higher starting salary for those types of um 

143.24 145.81 A: for that for that type of knowledge 

143.31 144.66 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

145.55 149.05 B: [mn] and what about for different industries i think it should be 

149.23 151.81 B: slightly different for different industries 

151.96 156.83 B: you know the harder the work or something like that like factory work 

157.69 160.88 B: or you know business work or clerk work 

161.06 164.81 B: um cashier work should be different i think than factory work 

165.34 167.53 A: mm i don't know that i agree with that 

167.24 168.64 B: (( really [noise] [noise] [mn] )) 

167.99 170.09 A: yeah i think that um 

171.55 175.01 A: [mn] yeah i think to certain people they can't do certain jobs that's 

175.34 176.78 A: that's unfair 

177.58 184.91 A: you know to someone that to say that you know because you're gonna sit at a desk you're l- you're worth less than this person that could lift forty pounds 

185.11 187.18 B: (( well yeah )) 

186.57 187.50 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

187.69 189.62 B: you know you're right about that too mm [mn] 

196.32 198.56 A: uh what d- what do you think minimum wage should be 

200.03 206.92 B: i would probably say between six twenty five and six seventy five somewhere in that area 

207.45 212.05 B: and that's still not a lot i don't think 

211.92 213.49 A: no it's not a lot 

215.99 219.94 A: because there there's a lot of jobs out there that don't start at minimum wage [mn] 

219.45 221.81 B: [mn] oh yeah i know um 

221.95 224.03 B: [lipsmack] but a lot of them do 

224.34 229.48 B: and that's the bad part and sometimes you don't get a raise for ninety days or 

230.47 233.05 B: something like that at a lot of jobs 

232.85 233.60 A: right 

233.62 243.25 B: and living three months on six dollars an hour or [laughter] even [mn] well what the minimum wage is now five dollars and fifteen cents 

243.68 246.59 B: is not good [mn] i guess 

246.81 252.99 B: well even if you like switched jobs even from a teenager who starts a job at five fifteen an hour 

253.13 260.28 B: i mean if they change jobs e- if they've had a raise at the other job you know they don't take that into consideration at a new job 

260.54 263.32 B: they'll probably start you back at minimum wage 

262.98 267.60 A: right let's give you incentive to to stay at a job instead of switching jobs 

267.25 269.23 B: yeah 

268.38 275.94 A: i mean a a teenager should learn that that you know they shouldn't be job hoppers they should commit to a job and actually stay at a job mhm 

276.20 287.86 B: [mn] yeah but i think also another thing to look for you know whenever you're looking at jobs and that kind of thing is the benefits and sometimes you'll take a lower pay for a better benefit 

289.62 290.58 A: that's true 

292.62 295.82 A: i think a lot of minimum wage jobs don't have very good benefits 

295.47 296.31 B: (( uh-uh )) 

298.99 301.36 A: just really all depends on on the job 

301.87 303.25 B: [mn] but there's some 

303.59 306.91 B: really good paying jobs that don't have very good benefits either 

306.84 307.86 A: [laughter] that's true 

307.44 316.15 B: [laughter] my i mean my husband's got a pretty good paying job and his insurance is terrible and it it's terribly expensive too 

315.94 316.81 A: (( right )) 

317.24 318.32 B: um 

318.11 324.40 A: i hear that bit ours ours is actually getting worse and worse [laughter] as the as the days go by it used to be really good 

322.46 326.29 B: [mn] well his company [mn] his company pays for his insurance 

326.45 331.43 B: [mn] but it doesn't pay for his family's and it it's 

331.46 336.16 B: like five hundred and seventy five dollars a month for all of us to be on his insurance 

335.85 337.14 A: (( wow that is a lot )) 

336.91 338.89 B: it [mn] it it's crazy um 

338.53 340.14 A: makes me feel better about mine 

339.81 343.36 B: [laughter] i'm thinking they need to find another insurance company 

340.18 340.81 A: (( [laughter] )) 

344.29 350.64 B: [mn] [cough] but back on topic of minimum wage [mn] it's kinda hard to talk about minimum wage for ten minutes 

350.28 351.52 A: (( yes it is )) 

351.04 351.96 B: [laughter] 

352.43 355.17 A: [laughter] i can remember when minimum wage was 

353.79 354.35 B: (( [noise] )) 

356.22 363.04 A: [noise] was a lot less but is that [mn] i remember when it was you know four twenty five four o. five something like that which 

357.31 358.82 B: [mn] yeah i think 

363.43 368.34 A: yeah i think it was twenty years ago so i would certainly have thought that minimum wage would have been more than five fifteen 

368.00 369.85 B: (( [noise] [mn] well see [mn] )) 

368.91 371.79 A: although like i said i [mn] i didn't really pay attention to it [noise] 

371.60 376.16 B: it's been i guess since my first job i was uh 

376.24 382.46 B: sixteen years ago or so i started my first job and i think minimum wage was three eighty five 

382.95 385.33 B: here where i live in north carolina 

385.83 387.14 B: (( [mn] and )) 

387.27 388.78 B: i was um 

389.41 391.52 B: a grocery shopping clerk [laughter] 

392.64 394.13 B: a cashier person 

394.02 394.77 A: right 

394.27 400.01 B: so and i got paid three eighty five an hour and i thought i was doing pretty good i was in high school though what did i know 

399.72 400.96 A: [laughter] 

400.24 401.40 B: [laughter] 

403.21 405.89 B: you soon realise though money doesn't go far 

405.55 408.33 A: no three eighty five certainly [laughter] doesn't go far 

407.24 408.98 B: [laughter] 

409.19 412.52 A: i think i spend more than that in gas just driving to the grocery store [noise] yeah 

411.96 413.72 B: exactly 

415.08 416.11 B: um 

416.27 420.87 B: (( what else can i say about minimum wage [noise] )) 

422.78 424.85 B: we both agree it should be higher 

424.63 427.86 A: yeah definitely should be higher than five fifteen 

433.05 437.40 A: um i guess the more i think of it the more i guess it should be more than you know six six twenty five 

439.35 441.12 A: in this day and age because 

441.19 442.93 A: things are so expensive 

445.21 447.49 B: and i think i don't know 

448.90 453.16 B: i'm trying to think about education playing into the minimum wage thing 

454.52 459.30 B: because most of the i gue- [mn] no that's a generalization and that's not right 

459.39 461.37 B: i shouldn't say that um 

463.23 468.92 B: i was gonna say something about people not finishing high school staying at a lower paying job you know 

469.66 471.09 B: but that's kinda mean 

471.17 472.36 A: (( mhm )) 

472.04 474.73 B: (( [laughter] i don't want to say that [laughter] )) 

474.40 476.79 A: [laughter] there there are circumstances where 

477.17 478.86 A: people can't 

479.31 482.69 A: um [noise] for one reason or another [noise] 

484.29 485.30 A: um 

485.46 487.10 B: find a higher paying job 

487.88 490.43 B: (( is that what you're yeah )) 

488.01 492.03 A: (( yeah yeah you know they lack the skills or they lack the experience or )) 

492.05 493.29 B: the education 

492.40 494.28 A: um or the education 

494.33 496.48 A: to get a higher paying job and [noise] i 

498.72 499.47 A: (( don't know )) 

500.19 501.16 A: um 

501.78 505.01 A: (( i lost my train of thought there and know [laughter] where i was going with that )) 

505.07 505.86 B: [mn] i 

505.99 510.32 B: i mean i know some people that make like eight fifty an hour 

510.48 511.71 B: and 

511.75 516.69 B: even that's not enough i don't see how they make it at eight dollars and fifty cents an hour 

518.33 519.83 B: and 

520.86 525.77 B: i [mn] i just don't understand how how they do it and they have a family 

526.04 528.93 B: and they're the only working person in the family [mn] 

531.12 533.31 A: right yeah i i don't know how they do it either 

532.79 534.38 B: [laughter] 

533.78 537.18 A: i don't know how you know even just a single person 

537.40 540.26 A: in this day and age makes it on a salary 

541.52 544.47 B: [noise] and to imagine starting at five fifteen 

544.77 547.30 B: and then you have taxes which have to come out 

547.13 547.92 A: right 

548.47 552.25 B: so what would you bring home maybe if you're lucky four twenty five an hour 

553.12 554.25 B: or four 

554.13 555.13 A: mhm 

557.16 559.90 B: ew it just keeps getting worse and worse 

558.94 559.84 A: (( [laughter] yes it does )) 

560.76 567.29 B: i'm going to go write the president a letter [laughter] [mn] we need more money 

568.09 571.00 A: [laughter] either that or the uh cost of living has to be lowered 

571.06 572.33 B: (( [cough] well )) 

572.49 574.41 B: that's true too um 

573.58 576.15 A: yeah when you look at it you know where does it stop 

576.18 579.54 A: because and people make more they spend more it costs more 

579.10 585.69 B: [mn] is is the five fifteen the united states' minimum wage or is it a state thing 

585.82 587.64 A: i am not sure 

587.15 588.82 B: [mn] i'm not sure either 

588.91 597.61 B: um because i know that it the cost of living is different in each state you know i i know up north [mn] 

598.00 599.90 B: it's a lot higher than it [mn] is here
