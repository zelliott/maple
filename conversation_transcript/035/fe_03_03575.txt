9.10 14.52 A: well that's good i kinda got a surprise i i done this a couple of weeks ago i didn't know i was getting another one which is fine with me 

14.33 20.16 B: uh yeah well i thought they'd de- decided not to include me in 'cause it had been a couple of weeks for me too 

19.87 21.12 A: oh really 

20.60 21.54 B: uh-huh 

21.52 24.48 A: so i guess it's minimum wage what we feel huh 

23.15 24.24 B: right 

24.50 34.16 A: well um i'm a homemaker so but so i haven't are you [laughter] yeah well i have a stepson and he's eighteen so he works you know sometime for minimum wage i honestly don't think it's enough 

26.24 28.83 B: m- me too [laughter] 

32.63 34.24 B: mhm 

34.44 35.30 B: well 

35.32 42.11 B: it certainly is better than it was but i still i i agree with you it's not enough 

38.55 39.63 A: mhm 

42.49 45.92 B: in some jobs it's not nearly enough 

45.61 54.20 A: oh definitely 'cause like when i was younger i remember minimum wage i think as being like two oh five things like that so i understand but then again gas was seventy cents [laughter] a gallon 

50.78 52.90 B: mhm 

53.55 55.73 B: right everything's 

54.20 61.91 A: [laughter] you know and a loaf of a loaf of bread was very inexpensive so things like that are you know but now i mean a gallon of gas here is what uh 

57.54 58.60 B: yeah 

62.29 64.77 A: dollar fifty or a dollar sixty 

64.46 65.86 B: oh really 

65.24 66.51 A: yes 

66.06 67.30 B: (( oh my )) 

66.90 69.14 A: i i i'm in texas i don't know where you are 

68.45 72.90 B: oh i'm in michigan [laughter] talk about the other end of the world [mn] 

72.29 75.02 A: oh my god [laughter] well no not really it's not too far away 

74.78 85.29 B: no not really i was amazed we flew to touson a couple of years ago and i didn't realize how close it was to texas [laughter] it 

83.49 85.88 A: yeah it is it's like the next one over there 

85.59 90.52 B: it seems like my gosh you know [lipsmack] but back to the subject 

90.08 96.39 A: yes now in california i i lived there when i was younger and i i understand they have a higher wage which they do need it 'cause everything's more expensive 

95.65 96.69 B: uh-huh 

96.67 101.09 A: but here like i said my son if you work minimum wage he only brings home a hundred and twenty a week 

101.29 107.61 B: well that's really not enough if a kid is in school and or even if he's not he's got 

101.45 102.63 A: you wouldn't 

103.06 103.92 A: no 

106.61 109.04 A: no he's not in school anymore right yeah so you figure 

108.06 114.97 B: that seems to take care of it anyway you know room and board and cars yeah cars 

110.74 111.76 A: yeah 

112.07 114.55 A: cars [laughter] car in- 

114.51 128.33 A: insurance [laughter] oh i like that room and board part thank you [laughter] he pays room and board here yeah w- 'cause he's out of school and stuff so w- we make him pay a little bit per month but yeah it's definitely not enough for him to and he works at a um chicken place 

115.63 117.13 B: insurance [sigh] 

118.20 119.10 B: huh 

122.46 123.42 B: uh-huh 

128.08 129.58 B: [noise] oh uh-huh 

128.61 130.21 A: that's dangerous work 

130.03 131.69 B: yeah 

130.88 133.06 A: for five dollars and fifteen cents 

132.90 135.09 B: yeah [lipsmack] [sigh] 

134.17 139.70 A: um like i mean i don't know if an- i think waitresses should make that much 'cause sometimes they do- like you know rely on their tips 

139.84 152.01 B: yeah well that's there's another thing that that really gets my goat these poor waitresses they say oh you're getting tips so we don't have to pay you as much well they do hard work 

151.54 153.06 A: that's right 

152.69 158.48 B: i have a friend that was a waitress and she said if it weren't for tips she said i couldn't live 

158.60 169.31 A: oh definitely i s- i started as a waitress before i became a manager for a restaurant and some people just don't tip as well as a- as they should maybe they can't afford it that's understandable but also we can't afford to live 

158.78 159.53 B: (( 'cause )) 

165.53 166.79 B: mhm 

169.23 170.97 B: that's right 

169.46 175.26 A: so you know it you can't make you're you're barely making minimum wage and what they do is at the end they would tack it on 

175.33 176.69 B: mhm 

175.35 179.98 A: to your uh ta- they would tax you for it or you'd have to pay taxes for something that you weren't making 

179.69 181.00 B: yeah 

180.41 183.55 A: 'cause you have to claim they said that you have to claim that you're making um 

183.92 186.56 A: minimum wage even if you're not on tips 

185.74 189.45 B: oh for heaven's sake yeah 

186.71 194.88 A: right mhm so now me like i said the minimum wage uh it's i think maybe six something would probably be better 

194.89 201.55 A: for the for the rent you know for kids to pay rent or you know people of course some people don't have the experience to do anything else 

197.72 198.92 B: uh-huh 

201.68 202.94 B: that's true 

202.95 205.54 A: without college or anything like that and 

204.51 207.48 B: and if they're not making all that you know 

208.14 215.59 B: and it's not and if it's i mean even if they're making minimum wage and it's not enough to get by on 

215.50 223.40 B: they're really not going to be doing their best work for it some some kids i'm not saying all of them are that way but you know they'll think oh well 

218.93 220.12 A: [noise] no they're not 

223.55 226.04 B: it ain't much i'll get a better job so i'll just 

226.05 228.24 B: you know slack off 

226.84 238.06 A: ta- yeah uh yeah i'll just pass the pa- pass the bar here and it's you know i'll do the little i can do until i can get better you're right p- plus it's not helping the economy i mean if they if they were making more money they would be spending more money 

232.39 233.72 B: mhm 

234.96 236.29 B: that's true 

237.73 239.56 B: [mn] that's a fact 

239.07 246.36 A: so it's kind of like it just goes around i think you know if you pay somebody something it goes right back in to the economy whether it's in groceries gas 

244.48 245.60 B: sure 

246.35 247.61 B: mhm 

246.52 249.19 A: you know apartments electricity 

249.22 252.57 A: so like my husband he doesn't make minimum wage but he doesn't um 

252.66 257.12 A: he doesn't always get a you know a wage increase when everything else goes up see 

255.29 256.42 B: oh uh-huh 

257.25 258.89 B: yeah that's 

257.30 258.34 A: so it's a 

259.07 265.70 B: well if they were to just consider increasing the minimum wage a little more often or a little 

265.71 270.25 B: better when they do a little more when they do it might help a whole lot 

270.50 273.42 A: yeah for for them but then again for people like my husband who uh 

273.44 282.05 A: they don't you sometimes they don't get raises 'cause the companies use the excuse that well we they raised the minimum wage now we have to pay the other people more so we can't pay you 

281.05 284.65 B: so they ain't going to pay you more that's rough [laughter] 

283.73 294.78 A: so it's a double edged sword really so i i think they should earn more but then again it hurts people you know that are making more they can't get more because of the minimum wage [laughter] it's a double edged sword there [laughter] 

285.04 286.73 B: (( yeah it is )) 

292.19 293.60 B: that's right 

294.90 296.49 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

295.90 297.89 A: [laughter] so i don't know 

296.53 297.24 B: uh 

298.08 303.62 A: i don't know which was the which which is better i guess i would i'm more concerned about probably the children you know [mn] 

303.07 306.41 B: well that's that's a fact i just uh 

306.74 308.37 B: of course my son was 

308.41 314.36 B: [mn] i don't know what he's making but he's been with the company like fifteen years he ought to own it by now [laughter] 

313.31 315.14 A: oh no kidding [laughter] 

314.43 321.51 B: he he knows more he [laughter] i shouldn't say that he knows more than the bosses do whenever they have a problem they call for brian 

321.43 322.92 A: (( oh that's good see )) 

322.28 328.73 B: [laughter] and but so we don't have that problem but my other son had an awful time for a while there he just 

329.18 332.70 B: mom he said if my wife weren't working 

332.77 338.95 B: i'd be on the streets [laughter] and i said that is it that bad and he said yes it is 

334.77 337.47 A: yeah it sometimes i- it can be hard 

338.85 344.75 A: that's what i worry about my son yeah he's and he wants to get things but he can't and you know he works as hard as he can 

339.12 340.05 B: so 

340.38 341.40 B: (( yeah )) 

344.61 346.15 B: yeah yeah 

345.15 359.22 A: and then he's got he's gonna get a different job now because there's another job offer that's making more than minimum wage it's out working outside which is hot in texas i mean today was ninety something degrees [laughter] ninety at least yeah it it's hot here 

349.33 351.03 B: well good 

352.99 354.44 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

354.53 355.70 B: how many 

356.80 358.05 B: oh 

358.84 362.89 B: oh it's only around the l- low seventies here 

362.10 370.62 A: oh you're so lucky but then again winter you have the higher bills but right now my air conditioner's working overtime i have to get it serviced because it's been working for the last three weeks 

363.87 364.98 B: [laughter] 

367.45 368.38 B: oh 

370.22 372.57 B: oh gosh we haven't turned ours on yet in 

372.09 374.43 A: oh how nice non stop ours is 

373.35 379.74 B: fact it isn't even set up yet my son has gotta bring it up from the basement and and install it again 

379.59 381.35 A: oh oh you have a window unit don't you 

381.06 382.27 B: yeah 

381.67 394.51 A: yeah we have the whole house you have to here window units don't work [laughter] it's just too hot but like you said he can't get an apartment that's in a decent neighborhood or you know or a a decent apartment with what he makes on minimum wage 

385.31 386.91 B: well i can imagine 

394.38 396.05 B: (( hm oh that's true )) 

395.72 400.05 A: yeah 'cause i mean you have to have a car to get back and forth 'cause there's no buses out here so 

400.12 403.66 A: and everything keeps going up the buses went up even if there was one i mean 

402.99 405.11 B: uh-huh well it's 

404.80 407.82 A: like i said the gas went up the buses went up you name it it went up 

406.13 407.38 B: yeah 

408.15 409.93 B: the kids here are 

408.16 409.62 A: (( but yet his you know his )) 

409.84 411.31 A: wage isn't going up 

411.15 418.68 B: and i complain a lot about the about that and you know here the most the most uh 

419.66 421.19 B: i don't know t- the 

421.68 429.21 B: biggest part of of the [mn] job market is like restaurants fast food restaurants 

428.17 429.40 A: mhm 

429.29 432.63 B: i mean mcdonalds and you know and they 

429.51 430.53 A: (( oh definitely )) 

432.79 437.09 B: those girl girls especially they work their doggone heads off 

436.69 437.94 A: yes they do 

437.58 443.86 B: and uh [lipsmack] i haven't checked lately about how much they're making but i'm sure they're not making enough 

443.63 452.47 A: well some well there's a lot of places have started out like where my son started out he he didn't start off at minimum wage he could have his last job he did but they started off at like six fifteen 

452.54 453.86 B: mhm 

452.59 457.28 A: so that was good so that i guess that's an incentive to get them to work there but still it's not much 

457.29 465.39 A: not when you're working round the hot fire and and and customers we know how customers can be [laughter] so many different personalities out there [laughter] 

459.47 460.41 B: no 

460.61 461.80 B: no that's true 

464.65 465.83 B: yes 

465.92 468.37 B: sweethearts and others 

466.24 477.49 A: so like you said he he can't get anything yeah he's buying a used you know old old car i'm like well welcome to the club we've all had to do that now haven't we you can't you can't have the new thing at first because you're just starting out 

473.01 474.97 B: yeah i'll say 

477.48 478.44 B: true 

477.68 483.27 A: when you know when you get more experience in life and you get better jobs and you work your way up then you can get the more expensive things 

484.40 487.18 A: right now you have to start at the bottom like the rest of us did [laughter] [laughter] 

484.61 486.09 B: right [laughter] 

487.09 490.16 B: yes at minimum wage or below [mn] 

489.06 489.92 A: that's it 

490.03 492.81 A: y- yeah yeah like i said the waitresses yeah

495.10 499.71 B: yeah [noise] yeah [lipsmack] oh yes i retired as a steel buyer for a 

499.80 510.03 B: company that [sigh] sort of left us high and dry [sigh] i was the next to the last person out of the door they transferred everything down to alabama 

504.08 505.04 A: (( uh-oh )) 

510.04 514.13 A: uh-oh so you understand the minimum wage because they probably had a lot of people on that 

513.86 522.74 B: yeah yeah and he s- i said uh well the the boss asked me i wanted to go down there and said no thank you [laughter] i s- 

521.72 524.02 A: my husband's a welder if that's not strange
