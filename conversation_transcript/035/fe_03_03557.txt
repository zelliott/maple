13.69 14.82 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

14.48 16.90 B: so i guess we're not too far away from each other 

16.70 18.31 A: no that's not too bad 

17.74 21.00 B: so how close are you to like uh salt lake city 

20.40 23.83 A: uh we're just about uh ten miles south of salt lake city 

23.23 26.31 B: okay so you're just just not too far away from there then 

26.22 29.41 A: no not at all it's uh pretty close actually 

30.24 32.31 A: yeah and so where are you from south dakota 

31.68 35.07 B: hm [lipsmack] uh yeah from rapid city we're we're here in the black hills 

34.94 35.95 A: (( oh okay [noise] )) 

35.78 40.17 B: we're we're probably 'bout eh i suppose twenty some miles from mount rushmore 

39.81 41.73 A: oh okay i've been there once 

42.49 45.01 B: [lipsmack] yeah it's kind of an interesting place isn't it [laughter] 

44.84 50.57 A: yeah it really is really is i mean i like living in salt lake city and know that there is just the mountains or uh 

50.23 51.50 B: mhm 

50.95 52.34 A: very nice to look at 

52.02 59.07 B: [lipsmack] yep it's kind of nice to be able to basically walk out your backdoor and in ten minutes you're in in great great scenic country huh 

58.85 60.37 A: that's right 

60.91 64.26 B: [noise] yeah so i guess we're supposed to talk about minimum wage huh 

63.71 65.69 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

66.52 69.00 A: it's five fifteen an hour um 

72.16 75.79 B: [laughter] um i don't know i guess i always kind of have mixed feelings about 

76.18 86.00 B: about [sigh] you know minimum wage 'cause in a lot of case it seems like the people they're trying to help are the very people that actually end up end up hurting 

86.19 98.94 B: and because uh you know if you got somebody that you know isn't worth five fifteen an hour you're sure as heck not going to pay them that and so you'll find somebody else that's worth that and the person you're trying to help ends up uh [laughter] out of a job 

98.85 101.03 A: [cough] that's right yeah and with 

101.17 104.86 A: i think it really it it makes a difference in today's economy 

104.91 110.83 A: um and probably a lot more people who who are willing to work for five fifteen than there were three years ago 

110.33 111.93 B: (( yep )) 

111.42 112.85 A: and [noise] 

113.60 117.53 A: i judging by five fifteen and and the amount of money per work 

117.96 123.41 A: and that that rough- roughly translates into you know about ten thousand dollars a year annually which 

123.57 126.27 B: [lipsmack] yep isn't isn't a whole lot of money 

123.64 124.70 A: (( um )) 

125.42 127.06 A: it really isn't [noise] [noise] 

126.56 134.13 B: but i i guess a person looks at it that minimum wage is basically kind of like the starting wage [lipsmack] and i guess i've always kind of figured that uh 

134.55 136.51 B: that uh anybody that's 

136.67 142.10 B: you know got anything on the ball won't [sigh] be at minimum wage for long they'll you know work their way up 

142.93 147.22 B: up to a you know to a a decent salary level and 

147.48 148.57 B: (( and uh )) 

148.83 152.18 B: i don't know you know may- maybe i'm overly optimistic but uh 

153.00 156.42 B: but i guess i you know that that that's where i kind of always figured that uh 

156.71 159.94 B: that uh yeah if they got anything on the ball they won't be at minimum wage long mhm 

160.22 165.34 A: [noise] that's true we uh i i hire employees and we we pay higher than that with uh 

165.57 169.11 A: we we have a cashiering functions we try and pay a little bit more just to 

169.45 172.50 A: eliminate the temptation to steal 

173.01 177.76 A: so i haven't had to deal with uh [noise] with working at minimum wage employees um 

177.79 181.55 A: i think one of one of the drawbacks [noise] to minimum wage employees are the 

182.02 185.39 A: wi- with the lower paid there's a higher rate of turnover 

184.99 186.41 B: yeah it seems like it 

186.43 191.58 A: and uh u- unless you can get the the people that you're talking about who are the the people who 

191.62 195.80 A: who work a little bit harder and and and advance within 

195.87 199.39 A: and and you're right at that point you're not going to be paying them minimum wage 

199.91 204.23 A: (( uh even though it's pretty much one of the typical you [noise] get what you pay for )) 

204.45 209.01 A: you know pay minimum wage you're going to get the minimum effort and the minimum [noise] 

209.50 210.72 B: yep 

209.72 215.31 A: uh [noise] over the long run i mean you're right you may get somebody who comes in who will take minimum wage for 

215.54 220.58 A: three months six months with a complete desire to to move up 

220.64 223.67 A: but unfortunately there's there is those people who 

224.12 228.49 A: take minimum wage and don't put any effort in and you're kind of stuck with what you got right [noise] [noise] [noise] 

227.64 235.03 B: yeah not very well if i'm making a minimum wage i'm going to put minimum effort and [mn] i know one one place i worked at that i guess b- basically 

230.49 231.72 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

235.08 238.02 B: we had it up front we had an agreement with uh 

238.13 242.41 B: the employment agency and you know what they had to 

242.76 243.83 B: had to 

244.23 248.27 B: pay for you know commission employment agency was based on the starting wage 

248.30 254.37 B: and so we told people hey you know we're gonna start ya at minimum wage for the three months which gets ya by the 

254.35 263.78 B: you know the employment agency and if they're really good we'd you know sometimes pay the pay the fee for them and then you know after that period which basically is kind of the probationary period 

263.96 268.42 B: you know th- th- th- then we give them a nice a nice raise normally we'd 

268.77 272.71 B: i guess nor- normally we'd kick them up about you know two or three 

272.55 285.78 B: bucks over minimum wage and then kind of go from there but uh i guess nothing else you know to if they're they're paying the the the fee to the employment agency and then they'd cut their fee if we're paying it you know cut we uh what we had to had to pay 

285.95 287.67 A: right 

288.34 291.39 A: [noise] right yeah and i yeah and i 

292.34 296.95 A: i i think i think minimum wage i i think it is a it is a necessary 

297.56 302.60 A: uh point as well because if if not you are going to get people who will pay whatever they can 

298.83 299.44 B: (( [noise] )) 

301.94 303.04 B: (( mhm yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

302.90 306.73 A: uh taking advantage of situations and um 

307.29 308.90 A: it would be very 

309.47 312.45 A: very poor for all that kind of thing to go through where if 

312.64 317.88 A: you have somebody who has no choice and ends up making five dollars minimum wage can't even support themselves there [noise] 

319.26 325.38 A: one time i did get minimum wage i think people [noise] de- depending on situations but people may 

326.00 331.49 A: be better off um staying on welfare as opposed to 

331.67 333.21 B: (( yeah i've had a lot of people )) 

332.24 334.08 A: taking a job at minimum wage 

333.79 342.87 B: yeah a lot of cases you figure out the benefits of what you know what the you know figure out the cash benefits of what they get off welfare and a lot of cases they'd have to make nine ten bucks an hour 

343.00 347.16 B: just to just to equal what they're getting off welfare 

346.97 348.29 A: (( that's right )) 

347.62 353.51 B: and then they get penalized if they do go out and get a job and start making money they get penalized they you know lose their welfare 

353.63 356.67 B: somehow it seems to me like it'd make more sense to have some kind of [noise] 

356.60 369.96 B: sliding scale you know that if they're ambitious enough to go out and get a job rather than cut them off you know maybe [noise] you know have some kind of sliding scale that as their income comes up their their welfare benefits go down or something but 

369.78 382.23 A: and yeah not a not an all or nothing [noise] kind of thing it's a good idea i also think they should do welfare where it it goes on a a gradually decreasing that kind of goes by as well that incentivizes you to to get a job 'cause if 

371.94 373.52 B: right 

382.59 396.35 A: [noise] you work then you're getting a hundred percent the first two months and then it goes to eighty and it keep going down ten percent [noise] uh it's going to make you realize you know that you're hooking a lifestyle but but know what what's out there and 

396.41 403.65 A: say do you want to supplement your welfare income by getting a job and hopefully most of the job will surpass the welfare and get people back working 

403.37 405.07 B: mhm 

405.18 411.08 B: [lipsmack] yeah i gu- guess i al- i gu- guess i guess i always feel you know that gee shouldn't i shouldn't penalize people for 

411.01 422.67 B: you know for having the [noise] you know the the gumption to get up and you know try to better themselves and [noise] and i guess so much of the time that's what welfare does i guess they want to want to keep them dependent and of course i guess for a lot of for a lot of people i think that 

422.79 430.93 B: you know do well and yeah i'll keep my you know nice nice high paying welfare job if i can keep all these people fully dependent on me and in that way i got job security [laughter] 

431.40 433.92 A: [noise] yeah yeah that's one way to look at it for sure [noise] 

434.65 436.40 A: yeah you never know what uh 

436.72 440.07 A: what motivates people today in doing or not doing what they do 

440.22 441.72 B: mhm 

442.16 451.82 B: [noise] yep [lipsmack] oh well of course i i know you see see a lot of that in the minimum wage thing a lot of that comes i think from the the unions 'cause they know that hey if the minimum wage goes up then 

443.58 444.45 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

451.75 464.33 B: then they'll maintain their difference so their wage has to go up too and yeah i think i guess that's beneficial for them but not necessarily for those of us that buy the product [laughter] that they they produce [laughter] [laughter] 

462.37 463.29 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

463.83 465.00 A: [mn] that's true 

466.13 468.52 A: that's true you know it's sad about the uh 

468.65 471.81 A: the other interests who who want it to go up 

471.98 473.83 A: [noise] but i just uh 

475.46 477.53 A: (( [noise] i don't know i don't i don't see a )) 

478.19 488.41 A: as as far as the rate where it is now at five fifteen i'm not sure if that is the is necessarily enough though if if you do have somebody with unskilled labor and is trying to take care of family 

488.89 492.68 A: [noise] um trying to live on ten thousand dollars a year i don't think would uh [noise] 

493.28 494.58 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

494.05 495.95 A: would suffice for them 

496.76 501.53 B: [lipsmack] yep yeah and i know you hear this kind of little buzz ruler l- living wage but uh 

501.84 503.19 B: i guess if you're 

503.48 504.30 B: (( you know )) 

505.30 516.73 B: [lipsmack] that uh maybe minimum wage isn't meant to be a living wage like say it's part of meant to be a starting salary and you know if you're if you're worth anything of course i guess so many people don't look at it from the viewpoint you know they look at 

516.81 523.33 B: you know they're that they're owed you know they're owed so much salary they don't look at the fact that uh [noise] 

523.43 536.87 B: if you know they're not making at least as much you know value to their employers with what their salary is then they're basically a drag and they don't deserve to have the job [noise] and you know and you know people just don't look at it that way they think they're 

533.55 534.56 A: (( [noise] that's true )) 

536.86 542.57 B: think you know they're entitled to a job and because i guess like a lot of things you're entitled to a lot of things 

542.68 543.79 B: [laughter] 

543.54 546.15 A: yes exactly yeah i i 

546.39 559.88 A: i think you're right i think you're right i i think there are people who are forced to live on m- by on the minimum wage salaries and support themselves but i i think you're right i think it is a it's a way to get your foot in the door um i think minimum wage also benefits 

560.49 563.48 A: um high school kids who are trying to get their first job 

563.53 565.64 B: mhm 

564.07 573.41 A: um and uh structured it that way so they're not out there being taken advantage of by uh the corporation or by uh by somebody who's trying to hire them to work for them 

575.47 585.18 B: [lipsmack] yeah but i think so heck and i'd i think it's better minimum wage goes up oh you see like when you look at your fast food place you know your mcdonalds and burger kings and stuff 

575.95 576.87 A: (( um [noise] )) 

585.28 591.75 B: when the minimum wage goes up then all of a sudden gee don't have uh you know high school kids working there any more all of a sudden you got 

591.93 599.20 B: got you know adults working in there and and uh i know i had asked the guy that has our local mcdonalds one time said jeeze what happened to all the kids 

599.33 599.89 B: (( and he ))
