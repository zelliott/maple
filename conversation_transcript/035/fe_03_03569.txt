24.20 29.28 A: five thirty five or five fifteen i think it's five thirty five here in n._p._a. 

29.04 34.21 B: and it's five thirty five here i believe uh my daughter um m- 

34.63 44.90 B: m- is is working at minimum wage but she has a lot of benefits to go with it so it makes it a whole lot less than minimum wa- a whole lot different than just minimum wage with no benefit 

44.87 45.79 A: (( right [noise] [sigh] )) 

44.93 48.78 B: i haven't been on minimum wage in years 

49.29 51.01 B: i mean yeah 

49.93 55.04 A: but if you lost your job and had to go back to minimum wage would it be sufficient 

54.76 55.60 B: no 

55.68 57.84 A: with or without benefits 

57.33 58.16 B: no 

57.97 65.57 A: 'cause that did happen to me i was making more the i'm i'll tell you with unemployment i made more than what my husband made 

65.65 68.78 B: [laughter] [sigh] well i'm 

66.82 75.88 A: so unemployment is now gone [mn] i can't i could not take two jobs at minimum wage and be make it sufficient 

75.88 79.66 B: if you're an older employee if you're an older person 

79.75 94.55 B: uh you've already got yourself set you've already got your standard of living set you're usually in a mortgage uh usually got a ha- a car payment and the insurance alone wouldn't even be covered by minimum wage usually 

83.72 84.99 A: exactly 

93.31 95.56 A: that you're exactly right 

95.34 96.66 B: and uh 

95.74 99.78 A: and if you lose your benefits and you have health problems and medical 

98.93 100.92 B: that's right well that's 

100.10 103.12 A: minimum wage is not going to cover anything 

103.22 107.34 B: [sigh] no it it it covers your groceries and your gas that's it 

103.25 105.42 A: but you're you're usually in a bracket 

107.32 110.62 A: [laughter] and with and not gas the last couple of months [laughter] 

110.14 111.41 B: [laughter] 

111.39 116.79 A: [laughter] no but minimum wage is there is no way that in today's society 

116.83 121.30 A: minimum wage even for a high school student would be sufficient 

121.62 122.68 B: (( [cough] well )) 

121.96 126.30 A: maybe for a high school student it would be sufficient but more 

125.18 127.60 B: yeah with no responsibilities 

126.99 141.30 A: right with no responsibilities whatsoever it would be sufficient but once you start getting out into the world you have your own apartment and you're trying to become self sufficient and a producing member of society 

141.50 144.45 A: minimum wage just isn't enough 

144.33 145.54 B: exactly 

145.28 147.85 A: now should there be a minimum wage 

148.51 154.43 A: i think there should i don't i think companies like waitresses still only make two something an hour 

150.43 151.23 B: yeah 

154.33 157.58 B: ah waffle houses which are very 

157.63 171.88 B: [mn] very prominent here in this area uh the waf- uh my ha- hand signal's out on me i have to go to the speaker phone yeah that's the beeping that you're hearing uh but uh i have a niece that's working at a waffle house she draws two sevent- two thirteen an hour 

164.29 165.21 A: okay 

172.01 172.73 A: and 

172.02 173.73 B: plus her tips 

173.31 177.59 A: plus the tips there's no way that that it would be sufficient 

177.58 180.88 B: well no she's making it but i gave her a car 

180.91 181.86 A: (( right )) 

181.38 184.30 B: uh yeah it's just an old clunker 

182.46 186.19 A: and without the car she couldn't get to home to get to work 

185.75 191.66 B: actually she works about ten blocks from work uh she's renting a a r- dump 

188.75 190.18 A: so she can walk 

191.91 197.77 B: at three hundred dollars a month and it takes everything she can and and then she had to get a a roommate 

197.90 198.72 A: right 

198.71 201.98 B: because she could ha- have a place to live but she couldn't have a place to eat 

202.36 208.33 B: i mean that was her options she either got a roommate or she was without food or she did did without a an apartment 

208.66 215.26 A: [mn] so they're really keeping those little person down by keeping minimum wage at such a low rate 

214.85 219.39 B: but at the same time if they increase minimum wage everything else goes up 

219.79 221.28 A: [sigh] i know 

221.19 227.31 B: i mean it's just like my niece uh she's one of the brightest people i know and and my daughter too 

227.62 234.50 B: uh i have a twenty year old that's going to be twenty one year old uh daughter uh that instead of going to college 

234.70 241.35 B: they've opted to take the the minimum wage or slightly above minimum wage [cough] 

241.49 246.30 B: and build on that which is great except for one thing they could be in college 

246.17 247.02 A: mhm 

246.39 253.01 B: uh getting a degree where they wouldn't have to worry about whether or not they had to accept a minimum wage job 

252.90 263.01 A: well my niece just i have twin nieces and they both just completed college last year one went into psychology and the other one went into elementary education 

263.15 267.03 A: the one with psychology which is a nice major 

267.15 269.70 A: took a job in a home safe 

270.09 274.15 A: you know um shel- women's shelter at minimum wage 

272.57 273.30 B: yeah

295.99 299.38 B: oh now that notre dame is w- an ivy league 

299.17 310.08 A: right and they had full scholarships i mean they're very very bright and they had full scholarships to notre dame the the girls' school in cleveland not the not the main campus 

309.60 310.68 B: mhm 

310.02 316.05 A: but the branch in cleveland she's so depressed that they've put her on antidepressants 

316.32 317.06 B: hm 

316.61 324.09 A: because she's she's gone through all of this and she cannot get a good job above minimum wage in her field 

323.98 331.84 B: well now i went to school i got a two year degree associate's degree in horticulture from there i went to u._a._b. university of alabama 

332.02 335.38 B: (( and uh completed a bachelor degr- degree )) 

335.51 341.92 B: in um uh i started out in uh education p._e._p. program

363.52 366.84 B: uh averaging about twenty three dollars an hour 

366.89 369.76 A: if you you go to if you go 

367.09 369.00 B: with commissions 

369.91 378.14 A: to college and you get a bachelor's degree you choose to stick in that field and not have to start at minimum wage 

378.59 387.85 A: maybe you were not going to start at the top i don't believe everybody should start at the top but you should be at least two bucks above minimum wage start at seven or eight 

387.61 396.13 B: yeah a- and e- even in the job that i had at uh the uh cable company started out at seven dollars an hour 

388.78 389.79 A: (( you know it so )) 

396.30 397.66 B: in ninety five 

398.42 403.87 B: and i had no experience in that field but i was kind of more service orientated 

398.43 399.86 A: (( you're [mn] )) 

403.53 414.35 A: you're cutting out really bad here when i was when here in pennsylvania the small town that i'm in the taco bell was paying nine bucks an hour a year ago

422.56 427.47 A: so they were offering nine bucks an hour for closing shift

452.98 454.90 B: okay well i am too 

455.22 464.25 B: and uh and i agree you know this that you're good at and and yeah it's frustrating knowing that i put in all that time in college what it did was helped to open the door 

464.51 475.57 B: for me to get into something else and no one knew about my credentials until well after i had established myself because the old re- regime was simply hiring me as a token 

475.67 476.98 A: right oh
