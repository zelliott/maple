214.76 216.16 B: basically 

218.82 222.76 A: or at least around here we live in farm country 

222.48 223.48 B: uh-huh 

223.08 226.21 A: so uh when it comes time 

226.23 227.78 A: for them to

234.05 235.18 B: right 

234.43 238.68 A: for minimum wage and that is a tough tough job 

238.34 242.16 B: yeah it's rough you're in the in the outdoors all day 

241.86 242.98 A: right 

242.37 244.25 B: sun beaming on your head 

244.01 246.28 A: and it is so humid down here 

244.78 248.92 B: sweating and oh yeah forget it you know i can imagine 

249.11 253.35 B: i've never been to north carolina but i can imagine it's hot there all the time 

252.13 255.22 A: it's it's hot here [laughter] 

253.92 256.44 B: yeah i i can imagine it's hot 

255.30 258.15 A: and we have that wet kind of humid 

258.18 261.38 A: so you go outside and you feel like you've been mugged 

261.14 262.88 B: yeah moist weather 

262.48 267.97 A: right so minimum wage here you know to work outside all the time 

263.02 264.50 B: yeah yeah 

265.63 266.85 B: that's that's 

267.31 281.40 B: it's wrong for them to do that to people you know it's it's they they really need to raise it it it would be a blessing if they did but i don't expect it because i see how everything is going lately you know and price of stuff is so high 

277.93 279.03 A: right 

281.40 290.74 B: you know people who make minimum wages they make just enough to pay their bills and uh have food you know they co- have to be content with that you know 

289.98 291.10 A: right 

290.75 296.11 B: any type of necessities and stuff that you need you have to get you know the best way you can 

296.31 301.18 B: and it's you have to have some kind of government relief or some kind of help you know 

300.33 301.87 A: i think so too 

301.50 316.24 B: yeah you [mn] i mean right now we're we're in a crisis [laughter] you know and they're sending food over there to iran when people here there's people here that don't have food that can't afford to buy food 'cause of the prices [sigh] it's really wild 

305.86 307.17 A: that's right 

311.94 313.09 A: right 

316.45 328.67 B: but um if they if they were to raise it i think things would pr- probably level off at least two dollars you know if they were to raise it two dollars i think you know people could probably you know with the extra two dollars an hour 

328.70 333.14 B: that could help a whole lot you know even a dollar a hour would help a lot 

332.25 341.79 A: [sigh] that's right and what amazes me is the companies say we can't afford to do that and yet 

339.32 340.43 B: yeah 

340.92 345.03 B: and i don't understand that why why can't they afford they're making money 

342.10 343.99 A: and yet these people 

344.49 347.81 A: right and these people that are owning these companies 

348.25 350.21 A: they're making a killing 

350.17 353.12 B: uh-huh and they don't do any of the work 

350.96 352.08 A: and 

352.60 353.79 A: right 

353.55 355.44 B: all they do is push paper 

356.10 359.00 B: it's terrible it's really terrible
