0.82 1.97 A: hi 

1.75 4.41 B: hi uh this is shinda down in texas 

5.65 8.17 A: oh hey how ya doing 

7.04 8.98 B: not bad 

9.68 14.85 A: um this is uh john duboe from uh los angeles california 

13.62 19.47 B: i was just in los oh just in actually uh san francisco about six months back 

18.38 20.13 A: okay cool 

19.50 21.05 B: so minimum wage huh 

21.18 23.10 A: what's that 

22.11 24.26 B: we're talking about minimum wage 

23.90 25.79 A: yeah 

26.01 28.46 A: uh what about minimum wage on your end 

26.05 27.04 B: so 

27.83 28.81 B: um 

29.76 33.32 B: i i don't know i think the minimum wage 

33.45 35.83 B: isn't enough to live off of anyway 

36.22 42.52 B: there's really it's really uh depends on how you think about it like supply and demand the more people 

42.67 47.77 B: who need jobs the lower the minimum wage is gonna be because they will be willing to work for less 

47.47 49.65 A: right exactly 

47.57 57.70 B: but you can actually see in the tech industry people are willing to work for a lot less it's not even close to minimum wage but as long as people are getting employed they're working for less 

51.57 52.48 A: uh-huh 

57.33 59.25 A: right exactly 

58.59 60.43 B: and i think it'll become 

60.80 71.91 B: i mean it is good to have minimum wage so certain people who work at the lower end jobs like if i was working at mcdonalds i would like to make enough to survive on but if they 

72.29 76.58 B: don't make the minimum wage enough to survive on anyway and you get more from welfare 

75.99 77.83 A: right 

76.88 80.65 B: it's kind of a slap in the face like well i work but i don't get money 

80.50 89.91 A: yeah well it is kind of a um i mean it's i actually um especially for me 'cause i i i remember being the minimum wage being at three thirty five an hour 

90.06 93.02 A: and uh i was working at mcdonalds my very first job 

92.86 106.46 A: actually i was making three fifty an hour and actually [laughter] i remember when eighty bucks was my first paycheck and i was so excited and now it's like eighty bucks right now i i mean i can't even hold on to it for more than two days 

98.13 99.78 B: (( mhm mhm [laughter] )) 

100.03 100.97 B: (( wow )) 

106.04 112.38 B: yeah you you spend it all and um i don't know i don't have a solution for it but i don't 

112.50 115.19 B: minimum wage it's like it's just the guideline 

115.45 127.75 B: just like anything else is to make sure there's at least a certain level of competency whereas something like that just like getting a g. e. d. or anything like that is 

116.82 117.70 A: uh-huh 

123.28 124.20 A: uh-huh 

127.77 141.28 B: as long as you set the lower standard at least we have we have a some sort of education to earn some sort of money because if we don't set it i'm sure you know companies will be hiring people for a lot for a lot less 

134.79 136.67 A: right 

140.97 155.23 A: right well actually believe it or not i'm actually pretty excited because i actually found a way to get paid on people's electric and gas and and long distance and uh actually all their public utility bills so that's actually a referral base business opportunity it's called e. c. n. 

150.35 151.25 B: (( wow mhm )) 

155.04 163.37 A: so that's actually been able to put me in a position to earn money off that so i'm i'm kinda outta that loop of minimum job 'cause i i can't work for corporate america 

160.98 162.24 B: (( mhm [noise] [laughter] )) 

163.07 166.18 B: yes corporate america i've been working for a while and it's

180.23 181.22 A: uh-huh 

184.49 189.74 B: italian people who uh who are very rude [laughter] 

189.14 198.31 A: yeah yeah and you know they don't appreciate good workers in mean i i worked for uh riot aid which is a uh which is like a like a you know you 

189.78 190.78 B: (( but )) 

192.53 193.48 B: oh no 

196.30 197.28 B: the chain 

198.25 205.25 A: know it's a drug store and i remember working behind the ice cream counter i i used to be the ice cream guy and i used to um 

199.17 200.20 B: yeah mhm 

203.58 204.43 B: yeah 

205.16 217.39 A: have this one customer that would in and be very rude and he would expect and demand so one day he looked at me and he says oh don't worry you'll be all right you know you you'll one of these days you'll get a real job and i and i looked at him straight in the face and said 

217.22 223.16 A: you know you don't understand i'm not here i'm not here for a career i'm here to make to make money so i can have money in my pocket 

222.73 223.66 B: yeah 

223.04 235.83 A: okay um the difference between you and me is is what i told this guy the the difference between you and me is is that i don't need this money to survive off i live with my parents and you know i mean at the time you know of course when i 

234.84 235.64 B: yeah 

235.66 248.99 A: in my twenties uh i'm much older now i'm i'm thirty three but um um i i told him the difference between you and i is i don't have to pay my rent off this money this is pocket money for me to go out and have a fun time with you know um 

236.59 237.45 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

239.07 239.92 B: uh-huh 

247.23 248.04 B: yeah 

249.04 254.40 A: and so b- b- basically at that time i was i had no responsibilities i was living at home 

254.27 260.07 A: um but i i made it very clear to him that i working on on goals for me to get you know become more successful 

259.91 273.49 A: and you know and and i told him i'll tell you what i don't care if you go tell my manager right now i have a choice on whether i want to help you um serve you or not and if i don't want to serve you i will not serve you you can go tell my manager right now and i'll tell him straight to his face that you're a schmuck 

269.50 270.12 B: (( mhm )) 

273.18 274.20 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

273.42 284.62 A: i told i told him [laughter] that straight out and he his eyes bulged out when i said that and i said i'll take you to my manager right now i'll tell him that to you in front of him [laughter] you know 

274.77 276.01 B: (( [laughter] )) 

278.44 279.39 B: yeah 

283.60 294.38 B: well in a service industry like that your manager will if he's been a manager you know for a certain amount of time he'll understand that people are like that and of course 

294.21 304.35 B: but in front of the person he'll go oh yeah you shouldn't do that but after the guy leaves you know if he's pretty much a normal guy like me and that guy was just just wrong for doing 

304.19 306.09 A: yeah 

305.02 309.99 B: that 'cause i work in the service industry right now i'm i'm doing uh some support so 

310.26 322.63 B: you know you have a different face in front of the customer they're gonna play like oh yeah yeah you're right you know the manager will say yeah he shouldn't have done that and then at the end of the call it's like man that guy's such an idiot you know 

313.60 315.34 A: right 

323.00 329.45 B: [laughter] and so that's something to be careful of if you ever cross any support line 

329.69 331.18 B: there's people 

331.28 332.69 B: who wanna help you 

332.84 338.58 B: and sometimes you just can't do anything about 'em people just get mad 

337.56 339.64 A: that's right 

338.65 347.13 B: it's just like what can you do i can't do anything you can get mad but i'm trying my best to help you because that's my job and and i wanna help you but 

346.13 352.50 A: right well the other side of that is when you're earning minimum wage you know what they say you get what you pay for 

352.39 363.04 A: and so if you pay someone minimum wage you will get minimum wage attitude and minimum wage uh effort [laughter] so th- that's the other side especially when you're paying somebody very low wages 

359.75 360.49 B: (( [noise] )) 

362.82 363.87 B: oh yeah 

363.47 374.43 A: me personally i have uh my own business al- i have another business i do artwork when someone works for me i pay them you know at an adequate rate of you know eight to ten bucks an hour 

367.77 368.69 B: mhm 

374.07 374.98 B: yeah 

374.38 381.95 A: under the table because uh it enables them to be able to actually get paid and feel good about themselves if i pay them six bucks an hour forget it 

379.37 380.28 B: yeah 

381.84 385.21 A: um they'll give me six dollar an hour uh effort 

385.11 386.82 A: and i know that you know what i mean 

386.18 387.02 B: uh-huh 

386.59 401.34 A: and so um why put myself in that position or put them in that position insult their intelligence make them feel low for paying them that kinda wage 'cause they probably won't won't even work i mean before there was a time where you could pick up one of those hispanic guys off the streets 

401.30 403.21 A: and they'll work for five bucks an hour 

403.09 404.95 B: yeah because they need it 

403.30 406.81 A: but now they won't work for less than ten bucks an hour now 

406.17 413.56 B: yeah be- it's it's supply and if there's less than five if you can find someone for five dollars an hour say okay you know 

413.89 422.45 B: there are two people there and i have one job i'm gonna pay you you know ten dollars an hour or pay him eight dollars an hour 

415.86 417.66 A: yeah 

418.00 423.80 A: mhm mhm mhm 

422.48 425.31 B: are you gonna take eight dollars an hour or not work 

425.34 427.72 B: so it's really if you need the job 

427.75 433.34 B: if i needed a job i'd i'd try to you know get a job doing whatever working in mcdonalds 

430.18 434.69 A: (( mhm )) 

433.88 436.77 B: i'd work in mcdonalds if if i needed the money 

436.20 442.64 A: right see that's the other thing for me see if i'm broke and i'm hungry and i need money i will work for anything i don't care what it pays 

441.52 445.12 B: yeah i don't care i'll work for minimum wage i'm glad there's minimum wage 

443.27 448.95 A: at that point yeah yeah yeah but if i had the choice believe me i would not work for minimum wage 

447.99 457.30 B: oh yeah if i had the choice but most i i think minimum wage just like e- everything else is just the lowest common denominator to make sure everyone has 

452.14 453.17 A: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

457.36 459.38 B: has has at least something you know 

458.85 461.02 A: that's right 

460.00 472.01 B: it's not the best but it's better than other places where there is no minimum wage and they'll pay everyone's out of a job so they'll pay everyone one dollar [laughter] an hour or something if you don't wanna work i will give it to the next guy 

463.23 465.44 A: mhm 

468.06 469.84 A: that's right 

471.21 473.54 A: mhm 

472.35 475.20 B: but now at least you have you know something 

476.48 488.56 B: so yeah yeah that's that's pretty cool i think corporate america it depends the larger a company gets and if you're running your own business you'll you'll see that the more people you have you 

476.53 477.72 A: that's cool 

489.27 493.74 B: it's it's bad to say but things will have to change there's gonna be more process 

493.57 500.39 B: involved there's gonna be things that you don't wanna do to these people but if it's kind of a balance between 

500.22 514.18 B: making the people happy and doing what's right versus well i want my business to be successful as well and and for the for me i'd rather just do what's right and be somewhat successful rather than you know 

506.21 507.24 A: (( uh-huh )) 

514.24 519.98 B: um changing my morals and my values to make it very successful but corporate america doesn't think that way 

520.40 522.84 A: yeah yeah 

520.78 528.92 B: you get a bunch of guys together and they're saying we want more money and you're going to [laughter] do what you can to make more money 

524.94 525.98 A: (( [laughter] )) 

529.58 531.12 A: yeah that's true 

530.14 538.49 B: it's just more people you know one person is smart but you have you know ten people the more people you have together the dumber they get [noise] yeah 

538.31 540.14 A: yeah 

540.25 544.18 A: well i so you're you're working so are you off today or

557.76 560.56 A: really does it make pretty good money for you
