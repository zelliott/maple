115.03 126.92 B: ah three hundred thousand dollars for it i know it it's it's it's totally that's why we moved out of california we we originally lived in san diego my whole family lives there and my mother lives in in uh i'm uh from north san marcos area 

116.42 117.18 A: (( yeah )) 

117.47 118.32 A: terrible

145.56 151.74 A: so what's there about the minimum wage well i know i know that most of the businesses in the valley here are offering between 

151.91 156.49 A: uh eight and ten dollars an hour depending on your experience and and your age 

154.84 160.15 B: oh that's terrible for what how do people do that on it's it's even worse 'cause your standard of living is so expensive 

159.87 162.69 A: i know it truly is yeah so 

162.12 164.37 B: oh that that's disgusting 

164.33 170.65 A: i don't i don't know how much impact our discussion is going to have on the actual cost of living but [laughter] uh but it it 

169.67 181.10 B: well this that well i'll i'll go on record i'm totally against it i mean i understand if you're a child or or i mean a young person but if you're raising a family there's there's it's it's not feasible you can't do it 

170.68 171.63 A: (( er uh )) 

171.66 172.20 A: (( er )) 

180.82 184.50 A: is that minimum wage n- nationwide or is that statewide 

183.70 193.63 B: i don't think it is because they want to pass something in califor- in in arizona here to to have a minimum wage a minimum of like seven eight dollars if it was a government job so i think every state is 

192.34 193.66 A: (( yeah i think )) 

193.67 195.42 B: different i think 

194.83 198.50 A: i think you're right too 'cause i think ours is a little over six bucks an hour here

198.75 200.20 A: well i'm i'm 

201.12 215.25 A: no you're right it still needs and i k- and i know how important the benefits are to have too so that's that's something to take into consideration of course all the the store owners and and the business owners definitely need that consideration how much it costs to 

215.26 220.57 A: to uh to keep an employee under under dental plan a medical plan or retirement plan 

216.01 216.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] ))

237.11 250.30 B: [noise] yeah it is and our our agents it's very hard for them to find any kind of work and [noise] and i i i really appreciate it but it's it's like i said i've been looking for work myself you know just part time work and it's only going to pay six seven eight dollars an hour it's ridiculous [noise] 

246.53 247.49 A: (( right )) 

249.70 252.34 A: it is especially for a an adult 

252.45 264.25 B: [noise] an adult yeah and like i said doesn't matter and and here in tucson the standard of living is so cheap i mean you know the rent is cheaper than los angeles way cheaper but you still stay in the park for the same price i mean a hamburger's a hamburger 

262.87 263.68 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

264.32 268.49 A: well that's true now i know i was a fireman for thirty years and the 

267.80 270.56 B: oh really that's that must have been really interesting work 

268.68 269.88 A: the city 

270.29 283.11 A: yeah the city would hire overtime as opposed to hiring men because they'd pay us time and a half to work an extra shift where that'd be cheaper that'd be cheaper than hiring another fireman because of the retirement 

278.24 280.13 B: (( oh really [noise] [lipsmack] )) 

281.79 283.55 B: oh exactly [noise] 

283.23 284.49 A: medical so 

285.35 290.70 A: so we worked one to one twenty four hour shift for a fireman oh i was a captain it'd be about six hu- 

285.40 286.57 B: (( and you know that )) 

289.54 291.79 B: oh really were ya oh that's a v- boy 

291.76 294.57 A: so it's six hundred bucks a day if you worked overtime

294.96 295.75 A: (( that's what )) 

296.24 306.56 A: yeah i was er but then we kept wondering why we had to work so much overtime because we realized when the city wasn't going to hire we but i worked i worked there for twenty nine and a half years and like you know when 

305.31 307.09 B: oh that's terrific 

306.58 308.51 A: (( i came on on to the department at eighty five )) 

307.24 313.80 B: i have a lot of admire for the fireman i mean what you go through i i really admire you really after seeing what happened nine eleven [noise] boy i really admire and

313.84 315.11 B: that that's 

315.15 319.07 B: just disgusting i mean we re- i'm really you know i give it to you really 

318.73 322.44 A: [noise] [lipsmack] over three thousand lives and three hundred firemen were lost in that thing 

321.87 327.11 B: that's unbelievable just it's you know to this day i don't believe that that that uh that really happened 

323.16 323.96 A: (( yeah )) 

327.72 333.81 A: but uh but that that cost of living i mean i i think the minimum wage should be close to ten dollars at least to start with 

332.55 335.95 B: [noise] at l- you're right at least and insurance too 

335.94 336.90 A: oh yeah

369.68 371.40 B: (( and and the bill was six hundred six )) 

372.24 373.52 A: thousand dollars 

372.90 376.13 B: (( hundred and sixty thousand dollars i wouldn't know what to do )) 

374.52 379.92 A: and if i didn't if i didn't have medical insurance i would i don't know what i'd do i'd be in debt forever obviously 

379.01 386.82 B: you would be then that's right the people without i- it it's disgusting that's what i mean they have to they should do something about insurance everybody should have the right to have insurance and 

386.48 387.55 A: oh i know 

386.66 394.93 B: and decent pay i mean that's what um i told my wife yeah my wife's name my wife's name is gail i told her yesterday if she was in a third world country she would've been dead already 

394.91 397.38 A: oh oh that's isn't that true though that's sad but true 

397.62 399.44 B: it is really sad 

397.81 398.80 A: yeah 

399.78 402.01 A: i know i mean uh it's what 

399.88 400.99 B: just like you 

402.35 407.41 B: i was saying just like your thing if you you were in another country they wouldn't know how to take care of you you wouldn't be here right now 

406.18 415.86 A: well well well they almost they almost misdiagnosed it anyway so i mean i'm you know i was supposed to have died but i got lucky and and survived so i'm definitely lucky 

410.26 412.01 B: [lipsmack] really oh 

414.48 416.50 B: you know that's very lucky you are 

416.44 417.62 A: yeah 

417.74 428.90 A: but definitely without without a [sigh] other jobs you know now the minimum wage that that's a factor un- un- unfortunately on kids when they're when they're looking for jobs they don't consider the the benefits because they don't get sick too often 

428.91 433.79 B: i can't believe that you told me los angeles they only pay eight eight nine dollars an hour 

433.40 434.24 A: well 

434.36 438.43 B: well how do your kids how do the kids afford the housing what do they do 

437.39 445.54 A: well well my f- the one that's going to school is going to graduate school right now he works at a church so he's the the director of youth ministry at the church 

445.28 446.50 B: yeah 

445.55 453.63 A: and he's got some benefits there but my youngest son is a um a life guard and going to school and working for a for w- working for a grocery store 

450.49 451.69 B: yeah 

454.03 455.84 B: [lipsmack] in san diego right you said 

455.38 464.68 A: well the youngest son's living here in the valley with me but he doesn't have any medical coverage and he just turned twenty three so he's off my medical insurance too so if if he gets sick right now he's on his own 

458.12 458.85 B: oh 

462.31 463.65 B: oh my god 

464.68 466.04 B: oh my god it's 

464.71 468.43 A: (( which might happen but but there's no coverage you know )) 

466.18 467.72 B: yeah really 

468.65 470.99 B: that's terrible just terrible 

471.11 483.04 A: yeah i know it's uh it's really bad and you know we're talking about insurance i i i also sell life insurance too so i being older and like like yourself i realize the importance of having good coverage when you're young and most most 

481.24 484.12 B: yeah we don't even have insurance you know [laughter] 

483.11 485.93 A: most most kids don't yeah i know most people don't 

486.10 488.35 A: that's common and it's tough 

486.17 487.14 B: no 

488.52 489.89 A: and now for you 

489.91 495.86 A: it it'd be three times four times more than it would be for for my kids the twenty year olds you 

495.06 498.59 B: i know we should have b- we should have bought insurance a long time ago you're right 

497.87 506.58 A: know that's terrible and for me too i get the same coverage that they do they pay uh twenty nine bucks a month and i pay a hundred and fifteen for exactly the same coverage 

506.50 509.55 B: amazing 'cause you you bought it so many years ago 

509.00 517.98 A: well it's because of my age yeah i've got to pay more now but if i got it right now i did i've had it for the with the fire department so i'm okay but um 

516.43 521.59 B: so you're very lucky you had a good job with the fire department that had all those benefits the benefits out- outweigh everything 

518.70 519.47 A: (( well )) 

519.92 520.84 A: yes 

521.44 526.56 A: and who'd ever thought that would have happened you know when you're young you just take any job you can i thought a fireman would be fun to do 

526.63 529.25 B: that's right exactly right 

527.68 530.14 A: yeah were you in the military at all 

530.18 531.54 B: no no 

531.43 533.20 A: you missed vietnam then huh 

532.87 540.35 B: yeah well i was supposed to be drafted but [lipsmack] the uh i was a father at that time and we had one kid and and i was almost ready to go i mean they 

540.13 549.32 B: they they registered me for the draft and i had a i was living in i was living in chicago and i went in front of the board and my doctor wrote an order this person has only one kidney and they believed me 

544.20 544.85 A: (( oh )) 

549.23 550.22 A: oh boy 

549.39 553.62 B: everybody was trying to get it everybody wanted to get out of vietnam i mean not that i wanted to get out 

553.65 557.36 B: they said well let's take an x-ray they took an x-ray and they said no way [laughter] 

557.36 562.68 A: yeah well that's kind of i mean i went i wasn't happy about going but i got back from there so i got lucky that way too 

562.79 565.17 B: yeah i know a lot of my friends went to vietnam 

564.90 567.97 A: and so how long have you done this this phone thing have you been doing it very long 

567.25 573.69 B: uh this is the first one i've ever done my wife's done a couple already but it's variable and when you mention minimum wage that's a good subject 

573.79 575.20 A: well that's yeah 

575.30 579.55 A: that's interesting i i i've this is my first one too uh my girlfriend does it 

579.88 582.85 A: and she actually and she definitely enjoyed the conversations 

579.90 581.10 B: yeah 

582.92 585.31 B: yeah it's a very good conversation i know 

585.05 585.93 A: yeah 

585.45 590.43 B: (( i know well the person that uh they sort of give you a warning when ten minutes are up i think )) 

586.14 587.26 A: well that's good 

589.85 593.88 A: i think so too it must be close but i guess we have to give some input when we're done if 

594.64 595.94 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

595.49 599.89 A: we want i'm i'm i'm definitely going to suggest that they they raise the uh minimum
