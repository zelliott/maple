20.27 21.11 B: (( okay )) 

21.31 28.27 A: but i mean as you get older i just i can't see any way that you could be expected to live off that you know an- especially 

21.41 21.99 B: (( [noise] )) 

22.71 23.27 B: (( [noise] )) 

26.77 29.10 B: i know it [noise] 

28.84 29.83 A: absurd 

30.56 34.72 B: it is absurd there's just no way it's i mean [sigh] given 

34.81 48.17 B: i live in montgomery county and i think the minimum wage here or i used to live in montgomery county i think minimum wage here's like i don't know uh seven dollars and there were there was a bill to raise it to ten dollars but there's just no way you could live off five something i mean 

44.37 45.50 A: mhm 

48.00 49.27 A: oh god no 

48.32 51.40 B: especially as an adult with rent and bills and [mn] 

51.65 59.83 A: you'd be living check to check and you know like god forbid you know if something crappy actually happen to you or or like you know anything unexpected happened i mean how are you supposed to try to take care for yourself 

59.62 64.15 B: right even check to check i don't think it's possible to live 

64.21 69.95 B: you know off a full time job to work forty hours and make enough to like live you know like 

69.27 71.27 A: yeah [sigh] and you can s- 

70.31 72.74 B: i know it's very tough [noise] 

71.97 80.81 A: yeah you can say you know like well then why not get a second job 'cause people do that that's fine but i mean that's like uh that's still you know basically like you know ten bucks an hour gr- in uh total that's 

80.59 88.47 A: i don't know of any kind of service that you can render that that really you know any kind of even s- unskilled service still you know laborer i don't know 

88.20 89.83 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

89.42 94.05 A: people i mean and obviously somebody's going to sting the benefit i mean you've got there's some kind of 

90.55 92.13 B: (( [noise] )) 

94.15 96.88 A: you've got to be good at what you do or whatever but i mean 

96.90 99.86 A: i just can't see any justification for having it that low 

100.21 109.38 B: [noise] i know i really don't it's almost you just make enough so it's almost like they're fleecing people 'cause it's like it's just so low 

103.60 105.17 A: (( mhm )) 

109.19 121.19 A: it's it's yeah it's it's really i think it's insulting i mean it's it's almost insulting to say you know well this is this is all you're worth this is all you're you're just another person i mean that's fine but at least the people um at least the people who you know are employed you know 

110.62 111.84 B: [noise] 

116.79 118.23 B: (( right [noise] )) 

121.28 131.37 A: you know just you know do their job and and make you know make a decent wage or you know or [mn] you know uh it's not like it should be minimum wage it's not something you can you live off you you're living in poverty but still have a job 

131.51 133.23 B: right 

133.02 135.06 A: yeah but um 

134.16 140.91 B: and it's also like yeah if you i mean if minimum wage is so low what's incentive to go get a job if you know 

141.43 143.59 B: you're not going to make enough to live 

143.46 155.98 A: right [noise] what's the point [noise] i mean why not again what reason or what what incentive do you have to go out and get a job at all why not you know just ride out on unemployment for a while or why you know why not deal drugs or why not do anything else that's you know risky and it's illegal but 

153.89 160.16 B: exactly 'cause it's easier i mean most minimum wage jobs are not easy they're usually pretty labor intensive 

159.92 172.97 A: yeah oh service yeah service jobs are like i i i've w- i've waited before you know i've worked as the receptionist stuff and it sucked i mean it's you know i mean it takes a lot to just go there every day and try to be [noise] pleasant you know and and make your money i mean it's it's a skill 

160.63 161.89 B: and 

172.70 175.02 B: right and just to make such little 

175.56 182.84 B: they're almost like thankless jobs for like little or no money many times they don't even i mean they don't have and other things that 

182.25 190.98 A: yeah no benefits i mean y- you know if m- if maybe like you yeah maybe if you're [sigh] you know you're working and make minimum wage but you're also you know that if you if something happens to you you're taken care of 

183.42 184.33 B: yeah 

190.76 193.12 B: (( right [noise] )) 

190.85 198.65 A: and you know then that and that's another reason to basically you know to keep your job and to to get it you know for your family you know and family plans and whatever but 

198.86 204.88 A: to not to just be paid and like to be paid so poorly like like i could see you know why some 

201.33 203.05 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

203.90 213.74 B: yeah because i mean if um peo- i mean we i'm sure i mean even and those folks who have like decent jobs and make good money theres so many other incentives we get vacation time we get 

210.13 211.10 A: mhm 

213.91 215.33 B: we get 

215.59 223.16 B: you know there's so much more we can do that we you know get to do or get given on top of like so much more pay 

219.21 220.24 A: yeah 

222.98 224.36 A: right right 

223.51 236.57 B: and stuff i mean historical i think stuff costs more for like lower income people just because they really don't have the credit or they usually can't you know do stuff they can't buy a house they have to rent and stuff like that that's what's 

235.33 236.69 A: (( yeah i mean yeah )) 

236.47 242.59 A: yeah the opportunities for them i mean there's there's some and you know if it's it gets more like a social tax there i mean if they even if they you know 

242.04 243.66 B: (( [noise] )) 

242.50 253.71 A: they say now you can get the same rates you know and stuff i mean they might not qualify so they have to pay er you know higher higher rates 'cause people are afraid of them defaulting and stuff like that i mean it seems like it to be the other way around wanting to work 

251.15 252.07 B: right 

253.51 267.51 A: you know at least uh people in lower income brackets are you know they have the opportunity and if they default you know then then the rules should apply but at least the opportunity should be there and it should be a real opportunity and people you know people who have like luxury homes and stuff you could you know tax them to the ass it 

261.83 263.20 B: exactly 

266.80 268.57 B: yeah you know we 

267.90 269.09 A: doesn't 

269.81 278.71 B: it's i mean it's i don't know it's just law it's like i'm not quite sure what the fix is or how if if it can be fixed just because of the way society's built 

269.92 270.97 A: i don't 

273.32 274.00 A: (( know )) 

275.74 277.57 A: yeah yeah 

278.86 284.72 B: but you know you try not to think about it but when you do really think about it it's just wrong the i mean it's almost like they have no 

285.28 290.24 B: out you know it's like okay you stop in lower class and that's where you're going to be if you make 

286.34 287.30 A: yeah 

290.83 301.19 A: well you know it's k- it's kind of like a like a glass ceiling you know but not limited to just like you know not limited to just sex but in to an entire social class where you know you're wishing that you're so you know 

290.91 292.30 B: a certain amount of money 

298.64 299.98 B: exactly 

301.15 310.75 A: the situation's so bad we're like okay you don't make enough money and stuff you know actually costs more than it would otherwise because you don't make enough money it's like a catch twenty two 

309.72 313.05 B: so it just yeah it's like an endless cycle of 

312.46 313.67 A: yeah 

313.43 314.55 B: you know [mn] 

314.76 321.80 B: 'cause you don't make enough money your bills are late 'cause your bills are late your credit is bad 'cause your credit is bad you can't get a good job it just you know it's 

321.42 335.00 A: right yeah yeah and you and you yeah i think you can get out of it but you know it require- er i think it requires at least like a generation i mean it's going to it's going to burn you out definitely maybe your kids might have a chance if you bust your ass you know like your entire life but 

334.55 341.06 B: r- right but it shouldn't be that way but then again even your kids like just comparing your kids to like 

335.49 336.67 A: but that's pretty 

337.54 338.35 A: (( no )) 

341.20 344.71 B: other kids who come from you know regular middle class or 

344.43 345.59 A: yeah 

345.17 357.12 B: upper class kids they are at a disadvant- you know they're starting off at a disadvantage and that's really not fair to them 'cause i mean i i mean my parents were like working class barely middle class and you know i went to like 

349.18 350.19 A: right 

350.63 351.56 A: right 

354.50 355.77 A: mhm 

357.00 367.48 B: university of college so i went to a school that was pretty um uh i went to a state school but it was a good school where most you know i'll say eight out of ten kids were like from well off you know well to do homes so 

366.89 368.01 A: yeah 

367.45 374.96 B: i was getting out of class and going to work and they were like you know working on the project or whatever so it was like i almost felt i had to work twice as hard 

372.25 373.21 A: yeah 

376.14 381.87 A: well it's true i mean you had to you had you can't really focus you know you can't really put as much effort into 

376.17 377.12 B: you know 

377.32 379.02 B: to get yeah 

381.68 393.22 A: just learning and just l- and just basically you know taking advantage of your situation [sigh] as you might otherwise i mean you have you have other stuff to you know to worry about i mean i come from the other side i come from the other side where i mean i come from parents you know who 

388.89 390.50 B: (( [sigh] exactly )) 

393.04 402.95 A: who are very well off and and and we didn't i never had to worry about you know like m- making ends meet i still busted my ass 'cause my dad needed help you know and he wanted me you know to i think learn you know 

397.84 398.66 B: right 

401.07 401.63 B: (( [sigh] )) 

402.98 414.24 A: learn that you know it's not always like this where like you really i mean it makes you know you basically you know you earn your keep but i didn't have to i mean i i didn't have to worry about you know what if's you know or or bringing money in so i could go to school 

408.66 410.20 B: right 

412.10 413.35 B: (( exactly [noise] )) 

414.13 422.70 A: and it's it's tough i mean i have a lot of i've had a lot of respect for people who actually bust their asses and they do that 'cause it's not it's not easy and i don't know what i would do 

421.49 428.89 B: it's not at all and when uh i mean my parents weren't even close to like minimum wage type mo- you know so it's almost like i can barely fathom 

429.28 435.44 B: if you earn minimum it's like you have a you know a two income family you both earn minimum wage how do you send your kid to college 

435.27 436.65 A: right right 

436.04 437.04 B: you know 

436.88 446.16 A: right it's almost out the door i mean like you can't you can't even start you know you can't even start early and and put money aside i mean if you're yeah two two house incomes and you can't by i mean what are you you know 

445.80 449.91 B: yeah if you're not living you're not saving you know saving is not even an option 

448.10 449.00 A: yeah 

449.71 462.63 A: yeah even you know sav- saving if you're you know if you're middle class right now you know for you know for going to college i mean you can go to county college and shit like that but i mean [sigh] you know if you want to go to any kind of college where people say wow you went there you know and and you really got a good education 

454.61 455.66 B: right 

462.60 471.05 A: it's it's it's difficult i mean and even you know even county college i mean it costs money you're saving up a couple of grand you know for all the courses like four years so it's uh 

467.52 469.72 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

470.11 471.62 B: (( [noise] right )) 

471.95 472.91 A: so 

472.15 483.52 B: and many times i mean even if they're not even if like college is you know they get a scholarship or whatever they still have to help out at home because no kid is going to be comfortable at school living his life when he knows that you know 

483.39 484.31 A: right 

483.73 495.10 B: his folks are home barely making it there's going to be that pressure i mean many times a person's not gonna wanna but you're not going to go party with your friends when you know your folks are like at home barely making it you know like it's just i don't 

495.76 496.75 A: or you're 

495.77 497.43 B: know it's just 

496.56 500.66 A: yeah or no well adjusted kid is going to do that if if they do i mean if they do then you know i mean they 

500.53 503.44 A: you know they deserve to get to basically you know get 

503.31 504.38 B: (( right [noise] )) 

503.33 504.00 A: or the parents would 

503.99 507.75 A: be like no you know you can't do that i mean yeah yeah yeah i mean it's 

507.73 519.00 A: yeah no no respectful and you know mindful kid is even going to be able to to dis- you know distance themselves from that and sort of say okay well my parents are taking care of business now i can focus on just what it just doesn't that doesn't happen 

518.16 518.83 B: yeah 

518.91 519.85 B: true [noise] 

519.83 528.51 A: you're going to do whatever you can to you know kind of help them out and help yourself and that usually means like you know getting a full time job during school and again you go back to the same situation 

523.43 524.69 B: (( [noise] )) 

528.81 529.81 B: right 

529.91 530.86 A: but 

530.11 544.87 B: i mean it's just tough 'cause it's like the biggest thing is uh the hardest thing is to break from like one class one economic class to another you know like [sigh] okay even if you can't find a way to survive on that that means you stop doing that for the rest i mean how do you retire on minimum wage 

535.43 536.40 A: mhm 

544.89 545.46 A: (( [mn] )) 

545.86 546.67 A: yeah 

546.02 547.78 B: you know what i'm saying like 

548.18 562.76 B: [mn] most folks who are you know i'm just twenty three and i'm thinking you know i'm saving this so my company's matching it and i'm like okay you know maybe one day i'll be able to retire and maybe one day i'll have a nice little but how do you even think about that if you're not making enough m- you know money to live that's 

548.31 549.34 A: (( yeah )) 

562.20 574.99 A: yeah you can't you can't possibly think about retirement when you're li- when you're living you know when you're when you're [sigh] you can't really fo- focus on anything except for you know what happens if this you know if things don't come through for me next week you know what if what if they fire me 

573.02 583.60 B: exactly like you don't have your vision is so short it's almost like a weekly or basically pay check to pay check and do i have enough this pay check to survive to the next one 

577.81 578.68 A: yeah 

583.19 591.71 A: yeah and you can't be and you can't be anything except for short sighted you know even if even if you wanted to be even if you aspire i mean you you reasonably could not get any except for short sighted 

591.12 592.23 B: right 

591.92 599.89 A: and actually and that's yeah i mean that's that's i mean i i think it's like a fundamental attitude 'cause things aren't this way in canada or you know other states where they i mean they
