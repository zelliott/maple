0.22 2.23 B: hello this hi 

0.27 1.47 A: hello 

1.95 13.89 A: [sigh] hi okay my name's brian uh as you'll guess from the voice i'm british which gives me a bit of a different perspective on minimum wage as to uh what's probably the standard in the u._s._a. 

3.70 4.26 B: (( [mn] )) 

13.95 19.05 B: oh okay well yeah i [sigh] am american uh my name is steven um [cough] 

19.48 25.86 B: and uh wh- what what's your f- uh er scr- uh er [sigh] do you live in the united states currently 

25.29 29.03 A: yep i'm in northern pennsylvania i'm over here permanently 

27.21 28.18 B: (( oh )) 

29.09 30.03 A: it's uh 

29.11 31.02 B: okay so um 

31.31 32.66 A: yeah but see 

31.50 33.86 B: let's hear your perspective [laughter] 

33.01 34.13 A: well 

34.24 40.54 A: i mean basically we the minimum wage in the u._k. is far higher 

40.57 42.03 A: than it is here 

42.18 45.06 A: um it's something that we've had [lipsmack] 

45.27 47.11 A: for quite some time and with 

47.42 52.92 A: less shall we say resistance than there appears to be to increasing the minimum wage [sigh] 

53.17 58.37 A: um but i think that's due to the fact we've got much stronger unions in the u._k. 

57.98 59.48 B: (( [noise] [noise] right sure )) 

58.42 60.71 A: than seems to be the case here 

60.84 61.86 A: um 

62.65 65.65 A: but when all said and done looking at the amount 

65.92 69.76 A: that uh they're talking about as a minimum wage um 

70.33 72.16 A: (( y- you know i mean huh )) 

72.18 79.47 A: it it it it strikes me that the wealth distribution in this country is a little lopsided to say the least 

79.68 80.74 A: um 

80.89 86.78 A: we're used to an entirely different tax system and uh [sigh] you know i mean the 

87.79 92.06 A: i i i would think five dollars is derisory to be quite honest with you 

92.87 98.90 B: um [sigh] well i i have to start by pleading ignorance i had no idea that 

99.10 103.12 B: er the rate went up i i wasn't even sure what it was um 

103.60 106.13 B: i um 

106.29 108.41 B: recently um 

109.01 114.16 B: beca- lost my job and i've been l- looking for work and um 

114.65 118.22 B: it and when i've had work and i've i've done 

118.83 122.85 B: er fairly well out of uh different types in my life but now it's just 

122.91 127.11 B: i'm not finding any work employment at all and um [sigh] 

127.44 130.93 B: uh you know i i don't know how people 

131.56 136.61 B: you know could function on minimum wage um 

137.10 146.26 B: whether er i think it was four seventy five whatever or five or f- or five dollars and fifteen so what- whatever [sigh] they're raising it to i think it's so um 

147.24 150.31 B: incrementally small that it really doesn't matter 

147.88 148.86 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

149.24 149.81 A: (( [noise] )) 

149.86 150.80 A: (( [sigh] )) 

150.84 152.45 A: (( it [noise] )) 

152.49 155.41 A: all right that's my wife knocked the [noise] other [noise] phone off the hook [noise] 

153.64 154.43 B: (( [laughter] )) 

154.48 155.04 B: (( [mn] )) 

156.32 157.85 A: okay you still there 

157.42 158.82 B: i'm i'm with you brian 

158.29 163.54 A: yeah okay [sigh] um yeah i mean the the thing that seems to me to be nonsense i mean having 

163.75 171.80 A: moved over to this country about six years ago [sigh] um i managed to live in four different states 

171.82 173.56 A: in the six years 

173.73 180.24 A: and it just strikes me that the idea of a national minimum wage particularly in this country 

180.17 181.08 B: (( right [sigh] )) 

180.27 181.58 A: (( [sigh] is )) 

181.76 184.03 A: you know nothing short of ludicrous 

184.17 185.17 A: um 

184.20 186.48 B: oh yeah with- without a doubt [noise] [noise] [mn] 

185.89 191.91 A: it's i mean you you the the u._s._a. seems to set everything else on a state wide basis 

192.08 195.06 A: um you would have thought at the least [sigh] 

195.34 196.10 A: that 

196.05 203.78 A: this was something which could take um be taken some account of on on the state wide basis i mean uh [sigh] put yourself in 

203.62 212.10 A: i i i apologize having to use the states that i can [sigh] think of as uh examples but put yourself somewhere like 

212.26 219.97 A: oh i don't know let's say massachusetts as an example of a a fairly expensive state and go out to 

217.44 218.37 B: right 

220.17 225.78 A: montana and is it really viable to have the same minimum wage in both states 

225.44 231.35 B: [noise] [noise] um n- not not only isn't it i i live in new york city and uh 

230.57 233.30 A: all right well [laughter] 

231.78 241.28 B: yeah that's that's something i [sigh] uh i just uh you know got back from a trip from uh from georgia and 

241.74 242.61 B: (( [sigh] you know )) 

242.67 256.27 B: things generally may cost a little less but the big difference is housing prices and um yeah that's a huge huge difference in new york city versus other places so [sigh] uh 

256.90 266.35 B: whatever that five dollars an hour even though i don't think it's sufficient pretty much anywhere i definitely think it's far less [laughter] sufficient in new york city [noise] 

265.52 267.49 A: hm well certainly so i mean i'm 

267.61 274.25 A: i said pennsylvania we're actually quite close to the new york border up near up near corning and um 

269.14 270.13 B: right 

272.79 273.94 B: (( um [noise] oh )) 

274.38 275.22 A: the 

275.48 284.72 A: you know i mean i i we we moved up here from maryland where house prices were around oh probably two hundred thousand that sort of thing 

284.54 289.21 B: [noise] uh yeah greater like washington [noise] washington area's ridiculous yeah 

284.78 287.65 A: and uh bought up 

288.17 293.46 A: yeah bought ourselves well we were actually at the top end of maryland a- above baltimore 

291.44 292.75 B: (( oh okay [mn] oh mm )) 

293.51 302.15 A: but uh you know we we we move up here and buy ourselves a place and er it cost us fifty five thousand it's small but uh 

302.23 305.23 A: you know it it it uh there's no work in this area 

305.58 312.82 A: but um you know where the right in north central pennsylvania where there's very very little around but 

313.26 316.37 A: certainly i mean you know y- you that sort of 

316.93 322.55 A: er trying to compare the amount of money you need to live on in this sort of area compared to [sigh] somewhere like yourself 

322.46 323.50 B: (( [noise] right )) 

322.75 325.20 A: (( um you know it it's it's just a )) 

325.25 327.00 A: ludicrous situation 

327.57 330.77 A: um even new york state i mean we we look at the 

330.87 334.97 A: (( the taxes and so forth that are just across the border and uh )) 

335.01 342.89 A: you know and we we looked at new york when we were moving up here and uh we looked at the various taxes and so forth pr- property tax in particular 

343.03 344.89 A: and thought hell no way 

344.82 345.98 B: (( [noise] [sigh] [laughter] )) 

344.97 349.52 A: um you know [laughter] it just isn't viable [sigh] um 

349.75 355.68 A: and uh it it's it it seems to be that the state there the state of things that uh 

355.70 358.38 A: in new york city i guess is expensive to run 

358.57 366.35 B: um yes it's uh it it may not be as bad as it was two years ago but still it's unaffordable and and uh 

366.44 370.69 B: the state of everything else isn't [noise] as good as it was two years ago [noise] so [sigh] 

370.78 379.60 B: um yeah no [cough] um i'm glad they're [sigh] they're raising the minimum wage but right here in new york city like just on sunday [sigh] 

379.41 389.59 B: uh the price of a uh subway or a s- subway uh a bus ride [sigh] just went up from a dollar fifty to two dollars 

389.63 391.14 B: (( um )) 

391.18 396.02 B: i mean there are ways to make it cheaper with monthly passes or whatever but still [sigh] 

396.20 398.35 B: (( um you know that )) 

396.60 401.40 A: [noise] for someone on minimum wage travelling in and out to work each day that's a hell of an increase 

400.78 404.84 B: that's pretty it's pr- it's pretty drastic yeah um [sigh] 

404.95 411.14 B: and you know only to be fair uh we haven't had an increase since ninety five but 

411.35 420.25 B: [sigh] it's [sigh] i mean and i know er in philadelphia it's like two dollars a uh ride too but it's still um 

420.60 426.65 B: [noise] yeah [laughter] on minimum wage and [sigh] especially minimum wage with a young child would be uh 

427.41 429.64 B: [noise] would be pretty um 

429.79 431.27 B: [noise] what shall we call it [noise] 

430.51 435.42 A: hm well we're str- we might be straying off the path of minimum wage slightly but um i 

435.45 448.63 A: mean to my way of thinking those tax cuts should have been in the w- the way we do the thing in the u._k. with a [sigh] a threshold over which tax doesn't cut in you know just if he's going to make tax cuts there should be money around everybody 

449.16 450.46 B: um 

451.31 457.75 B: [sigh] yeah yeah i mean taxes i'm sure are much greater there [noise] um than new york's here but you're right [mn] 

456.91 458.98 A: [mn] they're act- they're actually about the same 

459.06 461.84 A: er it surprises a lot of americans when i say that 

459.19 460.34 B: are they really 

461.78 464.34 B: that that does surprise me it [sigh] [noise] 

461.90 470.88 A: but but um yeah they they the way we have it is a a personal allowance which you know is effectively 

471.55 475.04 A: makes the effect of the minimum wage much greater 

475.44 476.69 A: you know you you 

476.94 483.58 A: you get a certain amount it's always tax free and it's quite a sizable amount er we call it the personal allowance 

483.82 491.66 A: and uh when a government wants to dish out some more money and do it equitably [sigh] then uh it does things that way um 

491.67 495.48 A: but i mean i g- i guess the the we're we're too 

495.94 501.88 A: [mn] we're too much on the same side of the political guide to make this a real debate um 

502.01 503.60 A: you know i mean the uh 

502.49 503.40 B: yeah 

503.62 507.70 B: no that that's [sigh] that's for sure um 

507.06 514.42 A: it's uh it seem it seems to me that uh you know that i mean playing devil's advocate for a moment the um 

514.95 525.23 A: the the people who would advocate not increasing the minimum wage would say it would cost jobs but it seems to me to be far many fac- far more factors in the 

521.68 522.93 B: (( it it may )) 

525.88 531.48 A: you know in the u._s._a. today that are costing jobs than uh just what the minimum wage might be 

531.19 540.25 B: [sigh] it it it may costs jobs i think um the or the other thing that they have to realize is right now um 

540.26 546.86 B: there's so many people out of work that i i don't know how many more jobs [laughter] it could really cost at least um 

545.40 546.18 A: hm 

547.37 548.25 B: (( you know )) 

547.46 552.64 A: well it's e- it's exporting them that's the main the main uh thing really but uh 

549.96 551.58 B: oh yeah 

552.85 556.21 A: yeah that's what that's what's happening in my industry but um 

556.71 557.84 A: the uh 

557.91 562.54 A: you know er given the the sort of people who are on minimum wage the uh 

562.69 566.09 A: the shop you know the shop assistants that kind of shop staff 

564.62 569.16 B: right the the fast food places right 

566.57 568.15 A: (( all that kind of thing )) 

568.63 569.87 A: (( it's um )) 

570.21 571.82 A: it seems to me to be a 

572.33 577.72 A: you know as i was saying five five dollars and fift- and fifteen cents or whatever it was 

578.45 589.23 A: [sigh] i don't know my way round the u._s._a. that well yet but uh if it's if it's inadequate in new york city i can only imagine some- somewhere like somewhere like california or something like that 

589.30 591.79 B: um probably on a same scale you know 

591.18 598.50 A: yeah the uh i i i mean i admit the places in california i've heard of tend to be the computer industry but uh [sigh] 

598.81 599.89 A: (( you know the [laughter] ))
