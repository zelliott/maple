36.70 37.50 A: (( [laughter] )) 

41.88 43.60 A: i think that they're looking for 

42.25 45.38 B: like the tonality of our voices and all of that 

44.75 49.93 A: i think that they're looking for a the uh the opinions just of people in general 

49.67 54.76 B: oh oh okay so i guess we'd better s- we'd better talk about what the subject is 

51.21 52.47 A: i could be 

53.11 54.01 A: well 

54.12 57.39 A: yeah yeah 'cause i think that's how you end up getting paid so 

55.02 55.96 B: uh-huh 

57.60 62.22 B: uh-huh okay well i'm a a i'm um 

62.72 68.28 B: i'm a certified debt consultant and i am working with people all of the time who are 

68.20 79.57 B: having a very hard time making ends meet in this particular economy and i especially in california [laughter] i can't imagine how anybody could live on that [laughter] mhm 

71.14 72.58 A: mhm 

75.67 78.19 A: mhm right that's exactly what i was thinking 

78.71 89.88 A: well and you know it's it's kind of hard my opinion with minimum wage i'm i'm a homemaker my husband is the one who works fulltime but before that i was the one supporting him and 

90.27 97.88 A: in as like you had said especially in california five dollars and fifteen cents if that's all you have as an income that's very little 

98.31 103.84 B: [lipsmack] yeah i really don't know how people can even feed themselves much less uh pay 

102.21 103.43 A: mhm 

104.25 105.06 A: (( [cough] )) 

104.41 110.82 B: pay for a a a place to live much less have a car or any kind of transportation and i mean it 

106.52 107.50 A: right 

109.77 121.12 A: yeah you know it works for my my seventeen year old brother where he l- lives at home my parents provide his transportation you know he doesn't have the bills but he has the opportunity to earn money for himself 

121.34 127.62 A: but when the time comes for him to go out on his own if he hasn't saved up this you know little bit of money that he's making 

127.78 135.72 A: he'll have a very you know and then you need to consider education and things like that where um education really comes into play with how much you make 

135.70 144.10 B: mhm [lipsmack] yes y- yeah yeah i just had an interesting idea that maybe they should have one minimum wage for like kids who are in high school 

143.74 145.01 A: mhm 

144.55 154.98 B: [cough] who ha- who don't have to completely support themselves and they should have another minimum wage for people who are trying to raise families [laughter] i don't know how they would figure that out but um 

150.69 152.11 A: yeah 

155.08 158.30 B: i'm just i i'm i'm just uh 

159.26 163.57 B: i'm really struck at how hard it is to actually 

164.64 174.32 B: live in this country i mean here i i just it just doesn't compute to me that it's the wealthiest country in the world and there are so many people who are just barely getting by 

173.87 179.05 A: mhm but i'm sure that being uh in debt anal- what is it debt analysis that 

175.96 176.79 B: (( and uh [cough] [lipsmack] )) 

178.95 184.95 B: uh actually my my company is a financial planning company out of sacramento but they help people who are 

179.40 180.18 A: you do 

185.20 188.11 B: who are really stuck and haven't been able to 

188.25 192.22 B: you know do much more than make minimum payments on their credit cards 

191.42 192.67 A: mhm 

192.28 198.68 B: and it the truth is if you're only making minimum payments on your credit card you'll basically never get out of debt 

198.07 208.24 A: yeah and it seems that we live in a in a country where s- everything is so easy to get on credit and to never be able to get out from underneath that 

204.11 205.09 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

208.12 208.97 B: yeah 

208.24 214.51 A: i know we've we've done it we are almost completely out of debt we started with ten thousand dollars and um 

214.55 215.64 A: you know it was 

215.32 217.72 B: good for you well it's a mhm 

216.27 223.98 A: as time has gone on that's that's been our goal is to get out of out of from underneath that and it's not easy but um 

224.41 238.89 A: [mn] as time goes on my husband makes more money he's uh he graduated from college three years ago and that was a big help because then you know i was the one bringing in ten dollars an hour and even that is not much but we managed to live off of it 

239.03 243.82 A: but yeah it's tough once you once you get buried 

243.38 253.44 B: it is it is it's uh it's amazing and i just uh i went to a website a few days ago um [lipsmack] oh what's the name of it it's called the uh 

247.12 247.74 A: (( [cough] )) 

251.86 252.68 A: (( [cough] )) 

254.10 261.07 B: national consumer council and they're really trying to create a whole education process for high school kids 

260.65 261.72 A: mhm 

261.09 265.16 B: to help them learn about finances and also to uh 

265.37 268.41 B: try to get credit card companies from stopping 

268.46 271.30 B: handing out credit cards on campuses and stuff 

270.16 272.24 A: they need that 

271.69 276.98 B: and they said something in one of the statistics or one of the things that they felt was anybody who 

277.31 283.25 B: couldn't w- who who was making minimum payments on their credit cards for more than six months 

283.68 286.81 B: the likelihood of them ending up in bankruptcy was 

287.30 290.08 B: you know very high like over fifty percent or something 

289.91 291.44 A: mhm 

290.58 293.65 B: it was pretty [laughter] it was pretty horrendous 

291.50 295.47 A: yeah and it's amazing and you see it all the time i'm sure 

295.33 305.88 B: uh day in and day out [laughter] and if you happen to have any friends my company is the best one in the united states [laughter] because it really helps it not only um 

296.83 297.93 A: yeah 

300.08 301.52 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

306.19 317.23 B: [lipsmack] it not only cuts all the interest rates if a person is eligible for our program all the interest rates stop all the late payments stop and they end up paying back about fifty cents on the dollar of what they owe 

313.36 314.84 A: oh that's great 

316.68 318.34 A: that's really good 

317.70 319.48 B: so it gives them uh 

320.57 326.13 B: the opportunity [sigh] the opportunity to start over without having to go into bankruptcy 

323.86 326.39 A: mhm without doing bankruptcy 

326.84 328.80 B: yeah yeah so mhm mhm 

327.68 331.69 A: well and another thing back on that topic of um 

331.74 339.92 A: of the minimum wage i remember when they had increased it i think it was at four twenty five and all of the small businesses started closing 

340.22 343.65 A: because they couldn't afford to pay their employees any more 

343.97 349.58 A: and you know i kind of look at it with that perspective but there's such an inflation 

349.66 352.62 A: and again especially being in california [mn] 

352.76 357.86 A: it cost it it seems like it's twice as much here than it is in other states 

358.09 359.18 A: and 

358.19 360.25 B: mhm oh i'm sure i i mhm 

359.35 361.79 A: for them not to increase it 

362.20 364.27 A: it's there's just no way 

365.40 377.83 B: yeah it was interesting i lived in arizona a few years ago and i moved back to california and you know all the things that i needed to do reregister my car rents everything was at least fifty percent more expensive 

369.98 371.07 A: mhm 

373.90 375.06 A: yeah 

377.47 378.53 A: mhm 

378.42 379.82 B: and um 

379.92 390.81 B: so i i don't know if minimum wage could be tied to the cost of living but my a- and and you make a point i mean small business it's really really expensive to have a small business 

384.28 386.10 A: and i think it should be 

390.81 395.65 A: you know and if they were to increase something even seventy five cents an hour per employee 

390.91 391.74 B: you know 

391.98 392.80 B: but 

396.30 397.31 B: that's 

396.57 399.90 A: it makes quite a quite an impact 

399.99 403.14 B: [lipsmack] it uh it does but um 

403.71 414.81 B: there are so many people not making it i you know i i don't i don't it it would be very interesting to [laughter] to uh really be able to penetrate sort of the 

405.96 406.93 A: mhm 

415.40 417.93 B: economics of everything and see 

418.22 423.82 B: what would be of the most advantage to the most people and the least damaging to the most people 

423.34 427.58 A: y- right right where a a kind of win win situation 

427.21 428.20 B: mhm 

428.26 434.79 B: yeah um 'cause certainly like like places like mcdonalds and where so many people get their food although 

434.88 447.46 B: it's not healthy food but that's where a lot of people eat and uh so if they raise the minimum wages that would raise the cost of food and that might make it difficult for a lot of families who don't have much to live on but 

436.19 439.03 A: [laughter] right [laughter] yeah 

442.29 443.50 A: mhm 

446.45 449.36 A: it's like a whole chain reaction sort of thing 

449.16 452.79 B: right yeah yeah but um 

453.57 457.21 B: [lipsmack] it certainly does seem like something needs to be done mhm 

456.95 465.21 A: yeah and i i agree with your point of trying to find a way to regulate th- the minimum wage according to the cost of living 

465.20 477.37 A: you know there's there's quite a difference between living in my family moved from california to idaho and it's the same thing where to register their vehicle it's thirty five dollars it doesn't matter if it's a new car if it's an old car 

477.21 482.54 A: you can go buy a brand new fifty thousand dollar car and pay thirty five dollars to register that vehicle 

482.24 483.97 B: [laughter] wow [laughter] 

483.29 496.59 A: and you know it's just those little things i'm like man you know my dad w- was working here and making nearly a hundred thousand dollars a year moved to idaho took a sixty thousand dollar pay cut and still li- has the same lifestyle 

496.71 499.51 A: and eight acres of land which is 

498.33 500.47 B: wow isn't that something mhm mhm 

499.73 503.94 A: you know just very different and so you know 

503.96 509.56 A: like you said if it was something where the high school kids were making five fifteen an hour they'd have no problem 

509.96 516.97 A: m- [mn] you know making it work a little bit easier cars are still the same price no matter where you go within r- you know on an average 

516.67 517.52 B: right 

517.28 520.93 A: but as far as housing and such like that 

521.57 525.02 A: you know it's it's very different depending on where you go 

526.62 532.07 B: it's [laughter] yeah it certainly is and i suppose even within um 

532.99 540.12 B: you know you'd almost have to break it down to counties or something like that if you were going to figure out minimum wage based on cost of living because 

539.32 540.24 A: uh-huh 

540.22 543.17 B: even in california the difference between living in 

543.39 546.49 B: you know some place rural up in the trinity alps 

546.56 549.30 B: uh is considerably different than trying to live in 

549.70 551.94 B: in uh downtown l._a. or 

551.20 552.35 A: sure 

552.04 554.42 B: or wherever fresno or 

554.84 557.94 B: yeah where i live [cough] the uh 

558.14 565.13 B: wages are sixty five percent of the average for california but the housing is going up very quickly [laughter] yeah 

564.00 566.34 A: yeah we've noticed that recently 

566.07 568.37 B: yeah yeah so 

568.48 571.33 B: i imagine it's similar to san bernadino it's 

571.99 573.51 B: i- isn't that where you live 

572.14 574.24 A: yeah our right 

573.74 574.72 B: yeah 

575.40 584.32 A: our house has jumped equity in in one year we've gained eighty thousand and and eighty thousand dollars on the the value of our home 

582.24 583.24 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah wow )) 

584.22 585.22 B: wow 

584.34 590.86 A: and you know it's like well do you sell it now but then you're going to buy something that's also jumped that high 

590.87 592.61 A: and so it's really trying 

591.07 591.88 B: yeah 

592.76 596.64 A: you know we're trying to decide exactly what we want to do 

597.21 599.95 B: [lipsmack] yeah i think the only uh 

598.44 599.40 A: (( so ))
