21.88 23.05 A: so we're supposed to 

23.12 27.95 A: supposed to talk about minimum wage if we think that five fifteen is sufficient 

28.64 32.48 B: (( you know i [sigh] i don't know really [noise] )) 

32.50 35.33 B: (( i've got mixed feelings on that uh um )) 

36.01 42.12 B: (( right off the barrel i'd well do you want to do you want to go first and tell me how you feel and [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

40.59 48.75 A: well sure um i actually make minimum wage [laughter] personally i'm i'm a waitress so i make minimum wage plus my tips and 

42.35 44.68 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

48.89 50.29 A: i don't know i guess it's 

50.84 55.16 A: because of the job i do i i make way more in tips than i do 

55.42 66.94 A: my hourly wage but if all i were making was minimum wage i then no i i don't think that's sufficient sufficient for like a fifteen year old maybe but not for an adult 

56.31 61.54 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

67.04 71.54 A: to to try to you know have any kind of uh 

71.95 80.87 A: you know just to just to live and and for housing and food even if you're just a single person that to me is is not a lot of money 

72.81 73.63 B: (( [noise] uh )) 

81.44 91.56 B: i agree with you a hundred percent um i mean i made minimum wage when i was uh out of high school in my first job but people can't survive on that [sigh] 

90.92 92.07 A: yeah 

92.50 98.56 A: i just like er i mean when i was in high school i was making like seven bucks an hour doing uh 

98.76 101.54 A: like telephone things uh 

101.45 103.35 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

101.72 106.29 A: doing fund raising and stuff so i i never made minimum wage until i 

106.46 115.40 A: a- about three years ago [laughter] when i became a waitress so it's um i've been in the workforce a long time before i ever started making minimum minimum wage 

109.26 110.02 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

110.06 111.36 B: (( oh yeah )) 

115.41 120.95 A: but like i said since i have i get my tips it doesn't seem like i'm making a minimum wage because i 

117.29 118.99 B: [noise] 

120.98 122.80 A: i get tips so 

122.03 122.65 B: (( [noise] )) 

122.71 126.90 B: [noise] right but unfortunately you get taxed on those tips too don't ya 

126.24 129.76 A: yeah yes i do that's true but uh 

127.50 130.68 B: (( yeah yeah [noise] )) 

131.20 134.02 A: you know [sigh] whatever what can you do [laughter] 

133.36 135.27 B: (( yeah uh you know uh )) 

135.64 137.51 B: (( i'm wondering if there is )) 

138.40 140.59 B: if there is a useful 

140.77 151.34 B: place for minimum wage like with migrant farm workers or someone who'd rather make minimum wage than [noise] not working at all i mean 

150.33 151.32 A: yeah 

151.74 154.46 B: i mean i mean i'm not 

154.54 163.69 B: um [noise] i take you as a waitress ought to make a lot more money than you than minimum wage plus tips because you guys work your butts off i 

160.43 161.40 A: right 

163.77 169.61 B: (( i trained to be a [laughter] i trained to be a waiter once and i lasted one night )) 

169.67 172.72 B: (( that's it's hard work i mean you guys )) 

171.04 173.53 A: [laughter] [laughter] yeah it is a lot of hard work 

173.78 175.42 B: (( yeah i mean )) 

174.52 175.28 A: (( yeah )) 

175.45 187.81 A: well mini- to me mi- it's it's kind of sad because minimum wage is supposed to be a guideline it's not supposed to be yeah you only have to pay people this it's like okay this is how much the very least you can pay them 

176.94 177.89 B: (( [noise] )) 

178.03 178.85 B: (( [noise] )) 

187.71 195.59 A: so instead of companies saying okay that's our that's the bottom and we'll pay you more they're like okay that's all we have to pay you so that's what we're going to pay you 

195.80 197.06 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

196.52 209.26 A: you know that's what i think is wrong with that is the companies don't actually have to pay people minimum wage they can they can pay them you know eight bucks an hour ten bucks an hour if they wanted to but they don't because then their profit margin goes down 

207.41 208.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

208.95 213.33 B: (( exactly and then the people who are against the uh )) 

210.13 211.20 A: so 

213.97 220.81 B: against raising the minimum wage i think that their argument is that if you're not or uh 

221.21 224.88 B: getting a minimum wage aren't are not enough jobs i mean 

225.15 228.14 B: (( er uh i don't know if i follow that argument [noise] )) 

228.88 230.09 A: i think there's 

230.33 232.69 A: i think more people would 

230.92 232.08 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

232.70 233.78 A: uh 

233.91 234.70 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

234.19 238.33 A: i just think would benefit everyone people's standard of living would go up 

238.58 243.20 A: um because the pe- the people in companies that profit from 

243.46 244.44 A: you know 

245.31 249.61 A: th- the people in in the companies that are making the big huge amounts of money 

249.62 256.87 A: uh you know they don't need all that money they're making you know the the people that are are that work for the companies that are making minimum wage 

253.16 253.99 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

254.88 256.43 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

256.81 263.51 A: they're the ones that need it they they need that money to to for just their basic needs 

260.95 261.51 B: (( [mn] )) 

261.62 262.43 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

263.15 265.48 B: exactly 

263.45 269.02 A: and these guys that are getting all these perks and going on on these golfing tr- trips and their boats and their 

266.50 267.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

268.86 269.63 B: (( [noise] )) 

268.90 283.00 A: you know sending their kids to these expensive private boarding schools i mean come on you know they have way more than than what they actually need you know the people with minimum wa- that are making minimum wage they're not getting their basic needs met 

271.02 271.87 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

274.28 275.62 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

283.02 287.68 A: and so all it all it's gonna do is all it would do would be to even out 

283.86 284.95 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

288.25 289.46 A: the uh 

290.19 293.46 A: the what am i trying to say just to to even out um 

293.87 297.77 A: the profits of the company how the peril is is 

294.24 295.44 B: well 

298.05 299.60 A: is divided up 

300.24 303.26 B: well that's true that's that's true 

303.37 308.13 B: (( i i agree with you [noise] i mean i i'm what what do you think um )) 

307.80 310.06 A: [laughter] 

308.34 310.52 B: (( what what the minimum wage should be )) 

311.71 325.18 A: it's it's interesting i mean that's just my opinion i don't have any uh professional or i don't do any research or anything like that so you know [laughter] i could just be completely wrong but that's what it seems like to me 

314.87 315.67 B: [noise] 

319.68 320.59 B: (( right uh-huh )) 

321.76 324.45 B: (( yeah yeah and uh )) 

325.28 336.80 B: yeah yeah i mean i don't think people can survive on minimum wage actually i think people who are on welfare or unemployment make more than the minimum wage [noise] [noise] 

336.10 344.54 A: right because it it actually co- it costs money ah to work it actually costs you money because you have to you have the transportation 

344.73 354.38 A: um some places you have uh to buy your own uniform or uh even if you don't have to buy your own uniform you usually have to maintain it yourself 

354.45 367.42 A: you know wash it and whatever so there's actually an- and then you know your your lunch or your dinner whatever you're usually eating at least one meal when you're at work you know it actually costs you money to work so 

367.92 370.85 A: um if you're making minimum wage 

370.91 373.46 A: you know as opposed like you said to welfare 

373.52 378.60 A: uh i i can completely see that because if if you're if you have welfare then you 

378.63 385.60 A: you're not working so you don't have those working expenses of a wardrobe or uh transporta- a 

387.06 390.79 A: car or whatever it is that y- however you get to work and 

391.96 393.43 A: that kind of stuff 

393.46 396.11 A: [noise] so you actually save [noise] on that [noise] [noise] 

396.21 400.47 B: [noise] yep i agree with ya a hundred percent um i'm 

401.50 407.35 B: (( just you know okay now here's it wouldn't matter if there were certain jobs )) 

408.14 410.59 B: (( paying minimum wage would be okay )) 

410.88 414.90 B: but you know that would be limited to 

415.26 417.03 B: like high school kids 

416.88 420.62 A: i agree yeah i think that would be a good idea 

420.75 421.66 A: to 

422.04 428.81 A: that there would maybe be a a wage increase or minimum wage if you're over a certain age 

429.62 430.69 A: you know 

432.46 441.96 A: that's a great idea [laughter] you should tell your congressman that idea [laughter] help those guys out a little bit they need some fresh ideas 

433.86 436.00 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

436.63 437.71 B: [laughter] 

441.48 453.98 B: (( [laughter] yeah now but i i you know i feel straight out about these executives who are making billions of dollars and and their uh their companies are going bankrupt er you know that doesn't make any sense )) 

453.36 454.48 A: yeah 

454.00 454.57 B: (( you )) 

454.63 456.35 B: (( know i really i don't )) 

457.13 464.28 A: well i think you know a lot of a lot of these big companies are so busy paying their top executives and schmoozing and 

464.05 464.85 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

464.32 466.63 A: you know trying to do deals that 

466.64 468.88 A: you know they're forgetting that 

469.07 477.92 A: you know it's if you treat your employees well they'll want to stay with your company and they'll have a loyalty to your company 

470.37 470.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

471.53 472.14 B: [noise] 

474.52 475.67 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

478.17 479.88 B: (( [noise] yeah i m- [noise] )) 

478.68 482.10 A: you know and that can only make your company better 

481.98 489.39 B: (( yeah it kinda brings it out i i work for u._p._s. and uh [noise] i used to be non union ))
