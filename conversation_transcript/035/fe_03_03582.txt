36.25 42.14 A: so i cannot believe that who the heck could live on five dollars and fifteen cents that's in 

42.18 44.79 B: it's it's incredible it's t- 

42.28 43.68 A: that's terrible 

43.96 45.78 A: that's disgusting

63.02 66.98 A: oh jeeze i would tell them to keep it that's disgusting 

67.21 80.44 A: well um you know uh i- it really is amazing that these large corporations that are making billions like mcdonalds and them you know even have the nerve to do that you know i mean that 

79.23 83.83 B: yeah wor- and they work them like a dog to pay them peanuts 

81.70 83.00 A: yeah and then 

83.36 92.09 A: yeah that's i mean and i how do you expect you know if you have a business you wanna pe- treat people good so that you know they do a good job 

91.86 93.47 B: yes yes 

92.79 100.51 A: and ho- how could they do i i mean i just wonder if any of these people that propose these and the people that propose it i wonder what they make a year 

100.35 104.77 B: a bunch of money like oh oh oh oh it's so disturbing 

101.61 102.77 A: (( i know god )) 

104.19 115.57 A: wow that's just too bad i'm sorry to hear that well i don't think you could survive on that and i wouldn't be surprised you know that people uh have to go on welfare just because they can't survive you 

115.07 116.09 B: correct 

115.49 127.91 A: know and then so what do you do you end up having people that think that getting n- you know no work is better because uh at least you're making something you know than having to work forty hours a week for two hundred dollars and then by the time 

127.94 130.67 B: oh the tax it's yes 

128.00 129.61 A: the government takes 

129.65 139.97 A: taxes transportation clothes you know that's insane you know i i i used to pay my babysitters five dollars an hour in nineteen seventy 

140.02 151.75 A: you know [laughter] so it's like and i'm not wealthy but you know anybody that came in and took care of my kids i wanted them you know to to be good and you know so i took care of them good you know 

151.09 153.15 B: mm yes yes 

152.38 155.29 A: that's just amazing well it just 

155.21 168.35 A: never ceases to amaze me that unfortunately people that are extremely wealthy uh don't realize that the best thing to do is kind of help people that are not and you know you have a little bit of satisfaction on every side 

167.79 171.07 B: yeah and they complain when they have to give them a raise 

170.71 180.64 A: oh that's amazing well uh i hope it goes through if if it's less than that uh i pray it goes through for the people that do need to work on minimum wage you know 

179.80 189.29 B: yeah i i do hope it gets higher than that though it 'cause it's uh you know they they need the problem is that people that are they're they have no idea 

181.92 183.18 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

184.46 185.02 A: (( [mn] )) 

189.20 190.25 A: yeah

190.80 195.76 A: yeah well you know e- e- e- even if a a teenager i mean god my grandchildren 

195.88 210.54 A: my gra- my granddaughter makes more than that on allowance uh you know uh if you wanna break it down by the time she gets the things that she lives on and my grandson he couldn't afford to buy the clothes he buys if he was working for minimum wage 

209.51 217.22 B: yeah like yesterday my son and i went shopping and [laughter] it was for just a couple of things that's two hundred dollars

226.56 233.71 A: you know what are we looking for them to do if we're looking at them to do jobs and good work we've got to give 'em a little more than that 

233.34 234.56 B: indeed 

234.13 237.98 A: yeah it's just it's just too bad and like i said i've been out of the 

237.81 250.18 A: um you know s- uh uh i mean i i i don't work anymore but when i worked it w- it was almost always on commission and so i never worried about a salary you know i i made what i earned and i just i i 

249.99 261.58 A: it shocks me [laughter] it shocks me to think that we're still so stingy you know and there's so much well i know the economy's bad too but you know ah i would much rather give somebody a decent 

251.60 253.27 B: yeah i i it
