5.19 6.91 B: oh [laughter] all right 

5.99 19.21 A: [laughter] so opposite sides yeah okay uh so minimum wage seems to be the topic of the day uh oh i i i didn't draw the sports card so [laughter] maybe that's another day um 

7.24 7.95 B: (( i )) 

12.17 13.35 B: yeah 

16.72 17.67 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

19.66 23.87 A: so minimum wage they said was just been raised to five fifteen 

22.97 26.25 B: that that's what they said yeah i'm i [noise] i wonder if that's federal 

26.60 27.73 A: yeah 

26.62 28.58 B: i assume that's federal 

28.15 30.08 A: is there a state minimum wage [sigh] 

29.27 35.65 B: well th- there there's a [sigh] like i know that in the l._a. area there's uh 

35.81 48.32 B: like the city of santa monica has a campaign going on and so sometimes it can work on a city and there can be partitions uh on a city and state level you know ordinances i'd say city or federal though not state 

48.38 54.04 B: [sigh] uh of 'c- 'cause obviously it depends on what you know area you're in you know it 

54.10 56.34 B: what how far that money's going to go 

55.85 62.08 A: [noise] oh okay yeah yeah like boston and uh probably any place [noise] in california it's not going to go very far 

57.27 58.26 B: you know 

60.22 61.40 B: yeah so 

61.63 65.25 B: i mean federal's one thing and then uh but that [sigh] 

65.28 68.95 B: you know five fifteen an hour's probably not too bad in idaho you know 

68.78 69.58 B: but 

68.96 69.95 A: yeah 

69.38 81.61 B: but in a big city it's not so [sigh] so sometimes you can see why there would be political movements on a smaller scale [sigh] did you know particularly you know [laughter] you know [sigh] it is an issue i think a legitimate issue and 

81.53 84.60 B: er like it's particularly if you're trying to raise a family there i think 

84.00 86.59 A: yeah i don't know how uh well i mean 

86.19 87.80 B: they can't really do it 

87.32 90.90 A: uh yeah d- definitely here in boston there's no way you could do it i mean 

90.15 97.23 B: [sigh] i mean the poverty level in l._a. is is seventeen thousand dollars if you can believe that if you make anything less than that you're considered uh 

97.31 99.15 B: below the poverty level 

98.59 100.80 A: i believe it [noise] i believe it [sigh] 

99.59 101.61 B: yeah and uh 

102.13 112.87 B: [sigh] you know a lot of people moving here i mean and so and so you know it's like uh it's a tough issue and [sigh] labor unions aren't very strong any more you know the teachers are the last one left 

113.32 116.89 A: oh are they one of the last ones i haven't kept track i d- i hear about it [noise] 

115.36 118.41 B: they're one they're one of the last ones left that has any clout 

119.56 121.23 A: yeah um 

119.62 128.83 B: i mean they've lost out labor has lost out and they're being replaced by machines a lot you know manufacturing sector 

129.59 132.42 B: you know the trend of the future is towards um 

132.98 140.05 B: [sigh] you know knowledge what they call knowledge workers you know there'll be a lot of people working at home with uh [lipsmack] computers 

140.12 141.73 A: [noise] yeah i 

140.72 143.03 B: next ten to twenty years that's what i read 

142.82 152.91 A: [noise] yeah b- but even then they might [noise] may eventually get uh be getting some kind of minimum wage kind of thing that's [noise] barely cutting it it's all going to become relative right [sigh] 

147.11 147.86 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

152.08 162.05 B: yeah it's tough i mean it's adversarial the relat- it's th- there's always been adversarial relations between management and labor in this country it there always has been 

162.22 163.91 B: (( [sigh] and there's been )) 

163.97 165.94 B: wrong on both sides you know 

165.76 166.67 A: yeah 

166.83 171.03 B: [sigh] but basically it's every man for himself here in this country [laughter] 

170.84 172.72 A: huh are are you currently working 

172.80 174.65 B: yeah part time yeah 

174.06 177.95 A: yeah yeah i am and i got my own company going but uh 

177.03 182.66 B: yeah i i work for myself too so i i take care of myself but [sigh] that's the only way i can do it 

182.68 195.23 A: yeah definitely [noise] i mean whatever minimum wage is would would not be cutting it i don't even think like anyone around here [sigh] i've never heard anyone making five fifteen an hour that's like uh i didn't even know what it was 'cause no one no one pays that 

192.80 196.85 B: [sigh] well that's like entry level um [sigh] 

198.04 205.26 B: you know washing dishes or um [sigh] you know i don't know construc- well construction it usually pays more than that 

204.57 212.87 A: yeah construction does construction people here get [sigh] paid uh i don't know anything where from [sigh] thirty five to a hundred thousand dollars 

211.75 216.03 B: they they make good yeah but the thing is we have so many um 

213.15 214.48 A: yeah they make good money 

216.23 219.15 B: illegal aliens out here see 

218.73 220.93 A: [laughter] 

219.99 222.60 B: i know it's a funny word but that's what they call it 

222.12 223.21 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

222.79 227.67 B: it's mainly mexicans come over the border see [sigh] you know they the borders are open 

226.80 230.33 A: [noise] and that and that pushes the the price of labor down 

229.36 235.74 B: well they take a lot they do a lot of day labor they do a lot of construction and they work harder than anybody 

236.11 240.87 B: you know they're they're known as real hard workers you know uh 

236.36 237.45 A: [noise] 

240.23 241.79 A: [noise] and and cheap huh 

241.49 249.44 B: cheap and hard working yeah and they put them in there and they put them in the kitchens and they put them on the on the construction sites 

244.07 245.27 A: [sigh] yeah we don't have 

246.84 250.19 A: (( [noise] )) 

249.49 251.00 B: we have a lot of that here 

251.07 257.23 A: yeah we don't have [noise] nothing well as far as i know there's not too much of that going on here 'cause it it's a pretty wasp- pretty waspy town 

254.61 255.48 B: no 

256.81 258.22 B: that's right 

257.72 259.00 A: so uh 

258.40 262.72 B: nah yeah it wouldn't they would- they they wouldn't be able to get it to cut it 

262.35 267.29 A: so it's interesting they it's interesting they paired us up because we definitely got two opposite 

267.18 278.47 A: you know kind of ends of the [noise] spectrum stuff going on here [noise] yeah like i i mean it means like like there's not a lot of like you know th- that type of thing going on here 

271.69 273.58 B: yeah wh- what do you mean [noise] 

277.87 280.22 B: yeah they they they don't allow it 

279.47 287.40 A: yeah i mean and and this is i mean the mexicans ain't going to travel to boston i mean to to live and settle down i mean 

286.23 290.62 B: no it's too it's too cold and it's too different and it's too far back home and 

291.34 292.38 B: right 

291.77 296.80 A: yeah i mean and and there's not hardly any spanish speakers either so why would they want to do it [sigh] 

296.44 297.49 B: right 

296.94 300.03 A: so yeah so that's interesting like it's like [noise] 

299.13 305.07 B: well out here th- h- the hispanics are a majority now just last year er 

305.11 309.00 B: they became a majority in the state of california they're actually a political majority 

308.40 309.71 A: really 

309.09 311.44 B: yep it's a fact 

311.77 316.44 B: [sigh] and so that's though and s- th- that means there's another legals 

316.71 317.97 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

317.34 330.82 B: to make a majority now now they haven't taken they're not that ambitious politically they haven't started taking advantage of that but [sigh] um you know the future of of this century that's that's a key factor [sigh] everything is in two languages out here 

328.24 329.31 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

331.46 338.28 B: e- english comes first but most of the time where you call up some place [sigh] press you know one for english or two for spanish 

339.00 340.35 B: in that order 

340.08 342.65 A: wow do you speak spanish 

340.99 342.43 B: [sigh] and in the 

342.71 345.71 B: do i some some just 'cause i took it in school 

343.31 344.17 A: yeah 

345.33 350.31 A: [laughter] [sigh] you want to know i don't know as far as the minimum wage just goes 

348.28 349.21 B: but s- 

349.33 357.83 B: santa monica is a very is a is like a beach town you've probably heard of it and it's kind of expensive and er they have like a hotel industry and stuff 'cause a lot of tourists 

357.80 370.98 B: this that and the other and that's who it's it was the hotel workers the [sigh] janitors and the maids and stuff er are the ones that have a big political movement going on to raise it [sigh] and they succeeded they raised it to uh 

372.00 373.85 B: seven or eight dollars [sigh] 

373.24 374.45 A: wow 

375.09 376.36 A: well good for them 

375.75 384.42 B: yeah yeah even al gore was out here campaigning before the last election and he was er speaking in one of the parks and 

376.66 378.21 A: yeah i was just about to ask 

381.11 382.53 A: al gore [noise] 

384.72 386.67 B: yeah he was for it 

386.74 399.13 A: [sigh] yeah i guess he should be er er er just because they they're the majority [laughter] and he just kind of like has his votes on the line but [sigh] uh yeah er i i was just about to ask how what w- what would happen if they did [sigh] sort of organize and push [sigh] 

388.85 390.24 B: yeah i know [noise] 

393.29 394.30 B: right 

399.15 407.91 A: and i guess you said seven or eight bucks an hour that's got to be the highest minimum wage [noise] of the country i would imagine in just the city or state [noise] just the city [sigh] 

405.69 407.18 B: it's just the city 

408.52 421.45 B: uh they were marching in the streets it was a big deal and um [sigh] gl- you know you know like legal stuff [sigh] and they they're they're and they're i don't know they're still fighting over it but i know they got some concessions 

421.70 423.69 B: but they're it isn't over 

423.91 432.64 A: yeah well you i mean you got to be glad for them like er er you know i mean five like you know h- how like you said how in a city like that how can you where are you going to live [sigh] 

426.55 427.39 B: yeah 

432.68 443.99 A: you know what you know what are you going to how are you going to have a kid or anything i mean i don't have a kid but you know [sigh] i definitely couldn't live here on minimum wage i don't think i could live there on minimum wage either 

435.94 436.89 B: right 

441.04 442.30 B: [sigh] no 

443.26 447.16 B: no i mean there's people i don't know how they live and uh [sigh] 

448.31 449.99 B: it's like uh 

451.05 452.86 B: [sigh] it's tough 

451.34 451.93 A: (( [sigh] )) 

452.43 455.85 A: what what do you think the mini- here's a now here's a question what do you think 

454.67 456.23 B: what do i think it should be 

455.86 466.84 A: what do you th- what do you think it would have to be for people to sort of live relatively okay where they could have a kid and and and not be like impoverished to you know by american standards 

466.20 468.73 B: well again it depends where you're living but 

468.09 470.22 A: what what about l- like your town 

469.98 472.42 B: [noise] oh you got to make um 

472.45 473.09 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] )) 

474.40 477.10 B: well a- at least ten twelve dollars an hour 

478.73 485.97 B: you know you got to take home at least three hundred a week and and even that [sigh] that's just like a bare minimum 

485.38 488.02 A: for like both parents making that 

487.42 495.27 B: yeah both parents that's a double income that's bare minimum i guess at the poverty level here which they acknowledge is seventeen thousand 

496.30 497.21 B: now 

496.47 498.16 A: yeah that's a yeah it 

497.59 503.00 B: two people making ten twelve dollars an hour that comes out a little over twenty thousand 

503.82 507.12 B: it's in early twenties then then you could raise a kid i don't know 

507.50 512.06 B: live somewhere for about you know six eight hundred well [sigh] 

512.21 517.97 B: between six hundred and a thousand a month depending on what part of town you're in and how big your place is [sigh] 

517.79 523.56 A: yeah here i'm guessing to to live af- within ten miles of boston you probably have to be making 

523.71 533.15 A: about forty gees a year seriously in [noise] a as a household which comes out to about twenty bucks an hour as as a household 

527.29 528.10 B: (( yeah )) 

532.30 534.49 B: it's probably even harder there 

533.79 536.99 A: it it may be it may be i may be totally underestimating it 

535.14 542.76 B: because well yeah you got to have a car well well you've got to have a car here too but actually you don't have to have a car there as much as you do here but [sigh] 

543.14 554.43 A: yeah you don't re- necessarily have to have a car but with a kid for instance you'd have to probably take him to school or where ever they got to be [sigh] but if there's daycare costs and things then that jacks it up you know 

543.25 544.04 B: it 

548.30 549.10 B: [sigh] 

554.36 560.01 A: you can't live on forty gees a household income with a kid i don't know how people do it if they do but 

559.29 564.49 B: there's some run down areas uh housing areas in l._a. it's probably more 

564.82 575.70 B: er more people and it's w- bigger and there's probably little pockets of where you can find some [sigh] find some cheaper places probably in general compared to boston probably [sigh] 

575.00 578.85 A: [sigh] [noise] but but in the where i mean like you said even like ten twelve bucks an hour [sigh] 

578.92 583.91 A: would probably be the kind of what you'd have to have and i mean but here it's about half of that [noise] 

583.73 592.49 B: yeah that's right and then you know and i realize ten twelve dollars is a lot for an employer to pay you know you know you you know you need some quality working done you 

592.92 598.68 A: yeah yeah it depends on what the hell you're selling so if you can't pay someone that much for pumping gas 

592.92 593.78 B: (( know )) 

596.03 596.72 B: it 

597.04 597.92 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

598.70 599.26 A: (( [sigh] )) 

598.78 599.89 B: right
