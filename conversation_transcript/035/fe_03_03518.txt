0.00 0.47 B: (( [noise] )) 

0.87 2.47 B: hi i'm margo 

1.98 4.12 A: hi i'm kristy [noise] 

3.60 5.83 B: hi [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

5.93 17.44 A: [mn] i'll go ahead and start um no i don't think that that five fifteen is high enough for minimum wage i think that no one could live on even two incomes of five fifteen an hour even fulltime [noise] [noise] [mn] 

16.90 21.47 B: mhm yeah that's probably true i live in the boston area and [mn] 

21.51 29.51 B: it just knowing like what rents are around here it it would be pretty tough but i think like unemployment probably 

29.80 33.32 B: i wonder if that works out to being like five fifteen an hour 

33.69 37.11 A: i think unemployment depends on how much you made at your job 

37.06 38.47 B: true true 

37.61 45.02 A: so i think that would make a difference but i live in orlando which is pretty much a cheap place to live and even on that i can't imagine trying to live 

45.18 48.83 A: on one income of five fifteen but even of two incomes of five fifteen an hour 

48.68 58.10 B: that's true yeah well and also like most minimum wage jobs don't end up being full time jobs so even if somebody were to work like multiple part time jobs at just five fifteen an hour 

53.64 54.92 A: (( exactly [mn] )) 

58.04 65.99 B: [mn] like their take home and all would probably not be like enough to cover both rent and overall cost of living stuff like food and all 

65.81 68.42 A: and i have a infant so if i 

68.46 72.96 A: [mn] it's not worth my time to work minimum wage i'd have to pay more in daycare than i'd be bringing home 

72.86 73.94 B: that's true 

73.99 74.55 B: (( [mn] )) 

74.83 75.70 A: (( so [mn] )) 

75.52 88.97 B: um [lipsmack] let's see what else about [laughter] minimum wage [laughter] uh it's actually i didn't i wasn't aware that it was only five fifteen an hour 'cause it seems like [mn] um like i freelance but i'm also looking for something to do 

88.89 91.62 B: in between jobs um 

89.69 90.51 A: mhm 

91.52 95.58 B: and so like the secretarial stuff i want that that i've seen is like 

95.44 110.34 B: six to eight dollars an hour so i assumed minimum wage was like six bucks an hour and [mn] e- even that like to think of people only making like six or eight dollars an hour as their fulltime job [mn] that's not a lot i mean when you figure like after taxes and all 

103.63 104.58 A: mhm 

110.10 111.05 A: (( [noise] nope )) 

110.15 110.83 B: (( mhm )) 

111.16 113.45 A: it would be very hard to live on even that but 

114.39 119.09 A: [mn] i know when i started working [mn] i'm si- twenty five so nine years ago minimum wage was 

119.20 120.47 A: four fifteen 

120.41 126.21 A: um in my f- four twenty five my first job was four twenty five and then it went up to five fifteen and everybody around me 

121.24 122.11 B: okay 

125.99 137.67 A: their pay went up to five fifteen but that's what i was making so the new people were making five fifteen but so was i and i had worked there for two years so i remember that being very frustrating that there is nothing to accommodate the people who 

133.01 134.47 B: oh that stinks 

137.67 144.03 A: are making minimum wage but not what minimum wage used to be but the people that came in were making the same as me even though i had been there a long time 

140.48 141.48 B: right 

143.86 146.25 B: (( yeah it was almost like you'd hit a ceiling or something )) 

145.76 152.73 A: yeah i was very frustrated that if i went somewhere new i could make more money 'cause i had more experience i was making 

151.49 152.57 B: (( right mhm )) 

152.99 157.79 A: the new minimum wage where somewhere i'd been for two years even though i'd been getting raises along the way 

158.13 159.59 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

158.88 167.30 B: yeah yeah and i remem well i'm twenty four and my first job in high school i remember i worked at um this store in the mall and [mn] them walking in and being like we'll 

167.12 175.33 B: you know we'll compensate our employees well we'll pay you more than minimum wage and i remember being so excited to just be making like five bucks an hour 'cause 

167.29 167.85 A: (( [noise] )) 

173.99 175.13 A: mhm 

175.52 186.81 B: as a high school student where you're not you know having to pay for rent or the majority of your food and your money is really just going towards like personal entertainment expenses [mn] that it's good but if 

176.72 177.68 A: (( right [mn] )) 

182.40 184.02 A: (( right mhm )) 

186.81 197.68 B: if you do have to cover like real life expenses i mean it's a good salary for a kid it's not anything to expect an adult to live on yeah 

193.17 195.44 A: right or a teenager 

195.96 196.66 A: yeah 

197.40 199.23 A: i couldn't agree more [mn] 

197.73 198.93 B: definitely 

199.41 200.42 A: (( mm )) 

199.55 204.08 B: [mn] is the um rate increase is that proposed for nationally do you know or 

202.83 213.87 A: that five fifteen is current um i know they're trying to i think that's what it currently is i'm almost sure that's what it currently is um i think they're trying to actually propose it to go higher 

205.44 206.73 B: (( oh okay )) 

213.96 216.96 A: and people are upset that they can't afford to pay 

217.30 219.90 A: [noise] more than five fifteen [laughter] an hour which 

219.55 220.34 B: (( mm )) 

220.16 221.59 A: [mn] how sad [laughter] 

221.42 227.01 B: yeah yeah i know there's been a lot around here um talking about like [mn] um 

226.98 234.88 B: not so much a minimum wage but making sure that people are making a living wage um like there've been a lot of protests around harvard in the past year 

230.55 231.73 A: mhm 

234.70 247.59 B: [mn] um or like the students in different like very liberal factions within the community [mn] pr- are protesting at the school saying that you know what you're paying your custodial workers and whatnot isn't enough to live on and 

247.49 256.33 B: i think they maybe have a little bit of a skewed perception of reality just because the rents around there are so high um but at the same time like 

253.19 254.29 A: right 

256.26 259.03 A: that's where they live so that's what they have to [laughter] 

256.34 257.59 B: you can't 

258.61 271.54 B: yeah well and also i think a lot of people that work at the school in like facilities management type positions um they can't afford to live around there so they're also paying high commuting expenses to get to where they they wanna be working [noise] mhm 

259.32 260.11 A: (( uh )) 

266.57 267.47 A: mhm 

271.79 277.17 A: and then we had a attorney in this area that ran for governor with our last governor's race 

277.06 288.78 A: and he was proposing everybody make a living wage and the opposing person the opposing person running for governor ran a campaign on how he had fired one of his workers one of his secretarial workers for saying 

288.59 293.52 A: you know you're saying how great it would be to pay everybody a living wage but you're not paying us a living wage [laughter] 

293.58 300.27 A: and she'd filed a law suit because that was his big platform but he wasn't doing it in his own law form to take care of his own people 

298.90 300.64 B: oh wow 

300.62 309.44 A: so he ended up [mn] dropping out shortly thereafter i'm pretty sure or losing i know he lost i'm not sure if he dropped out voluntarily but [sigh] that was very hard for him when that was his big platform item 

302.61 303.81 B: [laughter] 

309.83 313.35 A: and then [noise] he wasn't compensating his own employees that way 

310.01 311.17 B: yeah 

313.11 315.95 B: [mn] just a little bit hypocritical [laughter] 

314.48 316.25 A: yeah [laughter] 

316.06 317.78 B: [mn] wow 

316.38 324.78 A: but yeah [mn] that's what she was saying i can't live on what you're paying me how can you say that it's okay or that the other people should be doing otherwise but 

321.18 322.22 B: mhm 

324.41 328.87 B: yeah i know um there've been different things around here like in relation to um 

329.16 343.28 B: like companies being able to pay their workers enough and all just [mn] what with like lay offs and stuff occasionally you do hear about companies where [mn] you know a lot of the employees are willing to take a pay cut so that nobody has to be laid off 

333.55 334.48 A: mhm 

342.41 343.96 A: right mhm [noise] 

343.76 348.29 B: um and i have a friend that just started working um after being laid off for a while 

348.23 360.14 B: and i think within two weeks of being at his new job they cut everybody down to like eighty percent so [mn] yeah it's kinda like he only has to work four days a week now but it was good that he 

354.34 356.00 A: oh gosh but 

359.00 362.22 A: you only get paid for [laughter] four days a week 

360.06 366.93 B: ne yeah yeah it was like it was good that he negotiated his salary up because it didn't end up being his real salary anyhow [laughter] 

365.40 366.40 A: (( aw )) 

366.79 368.30 A: that's awful [sigh] 

368.79 383.60 B: yeah it it's interesting seeing there like what different companies are willing to do to either save face in front of their investors or you know try to keep their employees happy not that a lot of employees seem to be wanting to leave their jobs right now if they do have a job [laughter] 

375.39 376.28 A: mhm 

381.71 382.48 A: right 

382.66 385.24 A: yes [mn] people are happy making 

385.49 390.00 A: minimum wage especially around here because we have so many people that come from up north 

386.53 387.45 B: yeah 

390.02 392.18 A: where the cost of living is just so much higher 

392.23 397.92 A: [mn] so they come down here where things are so much cheaper than up north and they're like ah five fifteen an hour 

392.24 394.14 B: right right 

398.33 407.62 A: or a little more than that is not so bad but i've worked here my whole life [laughter] for me it's like ugh five fifteen i can't even imagine trying to make ends meet on that [mn] and i think 

399.93 400.86 B: (( mhm )) 

403.32 404.34 B: yeah 

406.71 408.95 B: (( [mn] what are oh i'm sorry go ahead )) 

407.74 410.33 A: (( go ahead no go ahead )) 

409.27 415.54 B: [mn] well i was wondering what's like average rents down there for like i don't know like a two bedroom apartment or something 

415.40 422.02 A: [noise] we had a one bedroom apartment and a little bit in a nicer [mn] area of town that was six eighty five 

422.27 425.92 A: and that was expensive um you could probably yeah [noise] 

424.29 434.86 B: oh my goodness [laughter] that's sickening [laughter] i know like um right now i live a two bedroom and it's twelve hundred a month 

434.27 441.18 A: see that's i have a brand new my house was brand new and it's twenty three hundred square feet and my mortgage is less than that [laughter] 

440.91 443.32 B: (( ugh [laughter] )) 

442.34 447.18 A: so and i think that makes a big difference i think that minimum wage here goes a lot further 

445.18 446.10 B: right 

447.31 453.81 A: than minimum wage up north it really does and that's why i think so many people are willing to move here and especially 

447.32 448.63 B: mhm 

454.12 466.27 A: people bring their whole families and they get a house the size of my house and have three different families living in it extended family and they all work minimum wage jobs but they're all doing fine because [mn] they're all living together and that's enough to take care of it but you couldn't 

458.49 459.37 B: right 

465.38 466.28 B: yeah 

466.68 473.99 A: pay twelve hundred dollars for a two bedroom [laughter] apartment and make five fifteen an hour [mn] and here the law is if you have a child you have to have a two bedroom apartment 

474.11 475.09 B: really 

474.41 486.78 A: [mn] even if you're a single mom you have to have a two bedroom apartment so it's impossible [mn] i don't know how people live in that situation [mn] where they making minimum wage and have a somebody a child to take care of and only one income [mn] i don't know how they do it 

477.44 478.62 B: oh wow 

485.61 492.31 B: yeah and if you're if you're a single mom then you probably also have to pay somebody else to do daycare so that you can work 

489.93 493.92 A: [noise] [mn] right because you have to work i don't know how they do it it's [mn] [mn] 

493.33 502.56 B: wow [mn] yeah i guess and i don't know if minimum wage is national or not but if it like the same blanket wage across yeah that doesn't make sense then 

499.43 501.38 A: it is [noise] that's the 

501.56 506.63 A: it's a federal mandate [noise] on what minimum wage is and it's the same here as it is 

506.57 507.31 B: hm 

506.76 510.20 A: where you live and [laughter] things cost so much more 

509.22 519.34 B: yeah it almost seems like it would make sense um instead for them to base it not on actual dollar amount but more like a a percentage so like saying like 

519.49 525.15 B: make minimum wage i don't know like seventy percent of whatever the average salary is 

524.63 533.15 A: or a living wage i think that is the best solution and we have some counties that have gone to that that will pay but i worked for the state when i got out of college and i made 

527.24 528.21 B: yeah 

529.27 530.25 B: mhm 

533.23 534.20 A: (( i don't know )) 

534.33 535.75 A: i think ten bucks an hour 

535.87 536.80 B: mhm 

535.95 538.88 A: [mn] and with a college degree it was so [laughter] sad 

538.68 540.60 B: totally yeah [laughter] [noise] [mn] 

539.64 540.59 A: so 

541.37 543.59 A: [mn] i- [mn] i don't know how you can 

544.06 547.52 A: justify paying somebody who has no experience and sixteen 

547.25 548.54 B: yeah 

548.19 551.40 A: that much more than what you're going to pay somebody who has a college education 

551.16 557.29 B: right and i think this in this economy you're seeing a lot more of like people with college degrees that are 

551.73 552.60 A: so 

557.24 567.77 B: willing or have to take minimum wage jobs i know um like i used to work at a consultancy actually they we had an office in um atlanta at sapient [mn] and um 

560.35 561.16 A: mhm 

568.48 578.20 B: there like after like the first round of layoffs i remember somebody coming into work like a week or two later saying that they saw somebody in a sapient sweatshirt working behind the counter at starbucks 

577.59 578.65 A: oh 

578.55 582.29 B: yeah we were all just sort of like oh my goodness you know it 

582.78 591.00 B: it i mean it's one of those things where you can sort of mock it because it's not you but it it it's scary 

583.09 583.84 A: (( right )) 

588.23 589.15 A: right 

590.07 591.75 A: scary 'cause it could be you 

591.60 595.46 B: yeah yeah and i noticed like i 

592.13 593.07 A: yeah 

595.55 599.95 B: [mn] i was laid off as part of their third round of layoffs i think [mn] like some-
