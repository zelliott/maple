0.20 1.47 A: hello 

0.73 1.96 B: (( hi )) 

1.58 2.99 A: hi what's your name 

2.50 3.45 B: barb 

3.16 8.83 A: barb my name is elise hi [mn] uh i guess we're supposed to talk about minimum wage today 

4.55 5.54 B: hi 

8.24 9.30 B: yeah 

8.98 11.04 A: (( [mn] what do you think [laughter] [mn] [mn] [laughter] )) 

10.12 11.28 B: well 

11.31 15.21 B: i guess five fifteen isn't a whole lot of money but 

15.46 19.91 B: they need to start somewhere and it is a lot higher than it was when i was a kid 

19.69 22.13 A: same here [laughter] yeah 

20.44 22.00 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

21.92 35.97 A: it's a lot higher now but then on the other hand i i remember as a single mom [mn] of course i didn't have to work for minimum wage but i i guess i'm thinking about those people that [mn] that are still single parents raising families and and you know if all they find is minimum wage 

35.78 41.47 A: which is better than nothing [mn] but how in the world would anyone support a family on that 

36.88 38.13 B: right 

40.84 45.53 B: i know that yeah it it's not high enough for that kind of thing 

44.94 50.49 A: no it certainly isn't especially when you consider how much the people that make these laws are making [laughter] 

46.34 47.39 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

49.32 51.26 B: (( oh i know it i know )) 

50.55 52.29 A: (( yeah uh )) 

51.42 55.74 B: now it is a lot [noise] for say a high school kid 

55.35 56.34 A: yeah 

56.40 60.80 A: yeah now that under those circumstances i think it probably would be [mn] i would it wou- 

60.73 73.70 A: i would imagine it would be sufficient [mn] you know i think that minimum wage was a dollar something when [laughter] i was a kid so [mn] oh yeah it was [mn] uh right around i know it uh right after i got married it went to two something and everybody was thrilled [mn] [laughter] so 

65.11 66.63 B: oh really 

72.15 77.89 B: yeah i think that's what it was when i first started working two something yeah 

75.14 76.38 A: really 

76.90 79.41 A: how long has it been since you worked for minimum wage 

79.43 84.03 B: well right now i'm not working at all so um 

81.59 82.88 A: (( mm mhm )) 

84.14 86.39 B: you know the last job i had 

86.68 89.37 B: i think i was only making three something 

89.54 93.90 A: no wow [mn] and was that enough were you a single person then or 

90.47 91.48 B: yeah 

92.87 105.88 B: oh yeah yeah now that was that was fine i mean i ended up getting raises you know after that but i mean that's what i that's what i started out at um when i started that job 

98.29 101.38 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

103.84 104.54 A: mm 

106.12 110.70 B: so you know going into a new job that that really wasn't very much 

110.19 121.48 A: not really no especially well [mn] i guess if it was a supplemental income if you were married and supplementing a spouse's income [mn] it might not be bad depending on what the job was and so forth but [mn] 

120.33 121.29 B: yeah 

121.40 126.99 A: i just don't [laughter] know it just doesn't sound like a lot when you consider today's expenses just food alone you know 

126.46 130.38 B: oh i know and gas gas is the big thing i would think bec- 

127.81 128.70 A: yeah 

129.61 141.16 A: yeah that's for sure and yet and everybody gets to have a roof over their head and at five fifteen an hour [mn] where you're gonna gross something like two hundred and [mn] what would you gross two hundred and twenty dollars a week maybe 

132.78 133.86 B: yeah 

140.92 144.20 B: working forty hours yeah yeah 

142.13 143.25 A: yeah 

143.15 155.45 A: and then you take taxes out of that [mn] i just don't know how people would even pay rent let alone food and utilities and [mn] oh you know i mean we all have to have shoes and clothes and at least minimal entertainment you know or we'd lose our mind 

151.90 153.08 B: right 

155.21 159.67 A: [laughter] so [mn] i'm not sure i'm not sure 

155.53 156.70 B: [laughter] 

158.62 163.55 B: yeah i know i [mn] well my son makes more than that and he's seventeen 

163.35 164.65 A: really 

164.00 172.38 B: yeah he started out as mi- um getting minimum wage but he's gotten raises and he does make more than that i think he's at six fifty now 

172.26 177.59 A: oh well that might not be so bad especially for a high school person but 

173.19 174.02 B: so 

176.14 181.51 B: well but even with that he's having trouble saving for a car and paying his insurance 

180.61 182.71 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

182.05 183.38 B: you know it's 

183.45 185.78 B: it's not very much these days 

185.27 191.14 A: it's really not when you consider the cost of living it just i don't know [noise] [mn] just seems kind of a little bit 

191.15 192.16 A: under wha- 

192.27 207.25 A: what the average person really would need unless you're just supplementing you know if if you're maybe a you know a married woman who is just going for pin money or [mn] or maybe to buy the groceries each week or something like that but [mn] i don't know that i'd want to put in a forty hour work week [mn] 

200.00 201.37 B: right 

203.44 204.37 B: uh-huh 

206.66 209.12 B: not for five fifteen no [laughter] 

207.84 218.27 A: yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] it seems kind of outrageous to me i i know i used to drive a school bus and i started out [mn] twenty five years ago at more than that an hour you know so 

209.16 210.18 B: no 

216.83 218.96 B: [noise] yeah yup 

218.35 224.50 A: and even that i was just basically buying groceries and that was it my husband was supplying you know the rest [mn] 

224.74 226.31 A: so i don't know 

225.92 228.69 B: yeah i don't think that's quite high enough 

228.06 236.39 A: no i think they need to go up to at least seven dollars an hour you know they're they're trying to get so many people off welfare now which is a really good thing [mn] um 

235.20 237.32 B: oh yeah they do need to work 

236.69 244.50 A: right but but i- if i were still a single mom [mn] of course i was never on welfare but if i were a single mom on welfare 

244.54 247.22 A: and didn't have any skills and had to 

247.44 250.75 A: work for five fifteen an hour how would i support my children 

250.34 254.16 B: well you wouldn't be able to so i guess welfare would be the choice 

251.41 252.79 A: no 

253.77 266.56 A: yup i mean i you know faced with that i i probably would stay on welfare and hope for something better or [mn] get more training or something that would that would enable me then to make more money [mn] but i just i just don't i don't think it's enough 

262.77 264.59 B: right right 

266.18 267.05 B: no 

266.68 280.44 A: i i really [mn] i mean i guess you know as you say it's better than nothing and it's better than it used to be but it's still not enough i just don't think it's sufficient as the question you know as they told us to talk about i really just don't think it's sufficient unless 

267.34 268.26 B: no 

279.46 280.40 B: well 

280.59 281.39 B: huh 

280.96 290.20 A: you know you're just supplementing your husband's income or something and just want to buy groceries or or have play money [mn] i [mn] i just don't [noise] know how they can expect people to live on that mm 

282.65 283.57 B: right 

288.13 289.35 B: well i know 

289.75 296.81 B: you know gas is three to four times more per gallon than it was when i started driving 

294.45 296.03 A: mhm 

296.35 297.54 A: right 

297.54 301.41 B: so just right there you're paying a whole lot more in gas 

301.07 315.93 A: mhm that's true when you consider the commute back and forth to work and wear and tear on your car i mean gasoline isn't the only thing you have to buy for a car you know [mn] so if a car breaks down then you're really in it [mn] i just don't i just don't see how a person can support themselves on it really 

308.16 309.84 B: right right 

315.48 318.48 B: no and the price of cars too i 

317.78 319.67 A: oh yeah 

318.56 323.70 B: mean my very first brand new car cost two thousand six hundred dollars 

323.20 325.27 A: [laughter] 

324.43 327.26 B: [laughter] and now what would you get for that 

326.26 327.25 A: (( [mn] )) 

327.33 340.91 A: phew i just to- i remember when my kids' dad and i were married years ago when we were first married there used to be cars on almost every street corner for fifty dollars [mn] you know just little used cars and now you c- i don't think you could even get one that runs for less than a thousand can you [mn] i [mn] 

334.71 336.54 B: oh yeah [mn] 

339.94 344.54 B: probably not where you would trust it not unless you knew the person 

342.58 343.89 A: right 

343.94 352.29 A: right right [mn] i mean i'm all for getting people off welfare but if i were on welfare and still a single mom and and i were faced with this option 

344.85 345.87 B: yeah 

353.06 356.43 A: [mn] i think i'd stick with welfare i mean you have to survive 

354.51 355.89 B: you would have to 

355.98 359.18 B: yup you couldn't you couldn't afford to do anything else 

358.53 359.71 A: no 

360.25 371.64 A: i don't know i don't know how to get 'em to raise it up to where it's a decent [mn] you know a decent level i mean a person might be if they had cheap enough rent they might be able to support themselves on seven dollars an hour i think maybe 

371.13 374.49 B: well you almost would have to have two incomes 

373.73 374.67 A: yeah 

374.68 378.47 B: if not you would have to have a roommate or two or three 

377.95 379.38 A: mhm 

378.68 380.33 B: to help pay the rent 

379.66 392.32 A: mhm i know i worked two or three jobs when i was a single mom and i was making way more [mn] than five fifteen an hour on most of them i had one job that was less than that but it was just a little part time job [mn] and um but the other ones were 

389.79 391.22 B: oh mhm 

392.23 404.33 A: you know i mean i drove a school bus and made twelve dollars an hour back in the nineties [mn] and that still wasn't enough considering it was only part time [mn] but i mean i w- i did work for a little bit but i you know for a for a little amount of money like this 

399.00 400.28 B: yeah 

404.31 410.63 A: [mn] but i had other jobs to supplement it and consequently i was never home with my children you know 'cause i was always working so 

409.95 411.23 B: oh right 

410.83 415.78 A: so i i just seven fif- i mean fif- five fifteen an hour i just 

414.64 417.77 B: oh and i'm paying for babysitters if you're not home 

416.57 418.04 A: mhm 

418.21 421.99 A: yep and there's just just way too many expenses these days [mn] 

421.87 433.37 A: for e- you know even if if both people if you're married and both people are working outside the home or if you're a single parent whether it's male or female [mn] uh the- there's just way too many expenses for five fifteen an hour to be enough and i just think it's 

432.02 433.63 B: [noise] [noise] oh i know 

433.28 443.34 A: it's unrealistic of our law makers to expect anybody to be able to survive on that and there are so many single parents these days i [noise] mean it's not like it used to be you know where 

440.56 441.71 B: yeah 

443.31 448.46 A: [noise] there were you know you wouldn't didn't see too many divorced or single parents [mn] but these days it's just 

448.20 453.29 B: but you know what if they raised the minimum wage prices of everything will go up 

448.70 450.50 A: (( hell [noise] )) 

453.46 456.17 A: [mn] you know that's true [sigh] 

454.24 458.97 B: 'cause then employers the employers won't be able to pay for everything 

458.70 459.69 A: right 

459.85 464.03 A: that's that's true enough but on the other hand if they if they would 

464.01 475.16 A: raise minimum wage and even if they raised prices if they could reduce our taxes that we pay for welfare and so forth [mn] then it might equal [laughter] itself out i don't i don't know [mn] w- 

470.82 472.46 B: yeah 

472.93 473.96 B: yeah 

474.05 475.72 B: it's so hard to know 

475.27 477.92 A: i know it really is and it's hard to [mn] 

477.38 479.03 B: kind of a big circle 

478.80 486.84 A: it is it is it's tough on tough on the folks out there i think that are really you know struggling with this minimum wage thing i just don't think it's enough 

486.46 487.45 B: yeah 

487.31 498.42 A: [mn] uh it's that's just my opinion and i guess that's all they're looking for [laughter] [mn] so [mn] well i don't know what would you think would be sufficient for minimum wage seven eight 

490.15 491.61 B: yeah right 

497.83 506.29 B: oh boy see there again you know you raise it too high and employers can't afford to pay it so i'm not real sure 

506.17 518.33 A: that's true i think if our economy were better too they might be able to demand a little better [mn] uh minimum wage for people you know if they had more jobs out there everybody'd be making more money and then the employers probably could afford 

512.60 513.60 B: yeah 

518.09 521.27 A: [mn] to raise the minimum wage a little bit and be able to pay it but 

520.61 521.60 B: yeah 

522.09 524.99 A: [mn] i don't know it's a tough economy out there 

523.36 524.02 B: [noise] 

524.82 526.90 B: [noise] oh it is it's terrible 

526.25 528.69 A: yeah it really is 

528.72 529.96 A: oh well 

530.05 532.73 A: i don't know minimum wage just does not seem 

532.94 535.97 A: i mean i really to tell you the truth i thought it was higher 

533.95 536.31 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh )) 

536.06 537.38 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

537.30 538.16 B: (( [noise] sorry )) 

538.17 539.84 B: somebody's at my door 

539.25 541.80 A: as i say you must have company [laughter] 

540.70 547.79 B: yeah well somebody's at the door [noise] and the dog's barking [noise] and we're supposed to keep talking [laughter] 

543.79 545.57 A: [laughter] 

546.52 551.36 A: yeah [laughter] maybe we should put the dog on the phone [laughter] 

549.94 551.29 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

552.61 553.38 A: (( [mn] )) 

552.84 560.81 B: [noise] [noise] [laughter] i guess i'm gonna finish the call since i have no idea who it is [laughter] [noise] oh 

556.17 562.25 A: yeah right [laughter] oh well what are you 

560.97 562.39 B: [noise] but 

562.46 564.54 B: pardon go ahead [noise] 

562.94 570.88 A: uh um i was gonna ask [mn] what what do you do for a living besides this and how much what is your average pay when you are working 

568.67 569.45 B: (( [noise] )) 

570.83 574.77 B: well um i haven't worked since i got married 

574.40 575.79 A: oh okay 

575.02 579.49 B: and i'm doing mystery shopping [noise] and um 

580.05 582.88 B: trying to get into that [noise] field because i 

583.22 590.31 B: tried to find jobs and [noise] the most i could make not working that long was minimum wage 

590.03 591.33 A: really 

590.67 594.95 B: and to me i mean i w- i'm competing with high school kids 

594.47 596.20 A: [mn] mhm 

595.51 599.89 B: [noise] in fact i think a high school kid would be chosen first over me
