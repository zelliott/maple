0.00 2.23 A: hello i'm evelyn 

0.62 1.98 B: hello 

2.44 4.38 B: uh my name's michelle 

3.98 5.35 A: hi michelle 

5.01 5.91 B: hi 

5.52 7.66 A: i'm in new york where are you at 

7.30 9.44 B: in uh denver colorado 

8.97 10.08 A: oh wow 

9.78 12.62 B: yeah my husband's from new york yeah 

10.97 11.64 A: uh 

12.30 13.95 A: oh yes what part 

14.10 15.43 B: um harriman 

15.18 19.58 A: oh yes i don't live too far from there yeah i'm in duchess county 

17.36 18.56 B: oh really 

19.39 20.38 B: oh 

19.86 31.13 A: yeah and minimum wage is not going to help here [laughter] it's nice but uh i don't know i think our question is should minimum wage be increased to five fifty an hour is it five fifty 

20.62 21.48 B: yeah his 

23.38 24.28 B: oh 

31.14 34.91 B: i can't believe it's that low i thought it was more than that 

34.44 36.43 A: no it's really not 

36.03 37.34 B: wow 

36.70 37.96 A: really not 

37.65 39.98 B: i mean i don't think i 

40.48 43.14 B: i really don't think anybody can live off that 

43.12 53.82 A: well you know a lot of teenagers and stuff work off of minimum wage but the interesting thing about minimum wage is that because of the last ten or so years of prosperity until 

53.87 63.62 A: um things went a little bit bad and then september eleventh almost nobody was getting paid minimum wage so it really was not a point of contention 

63.80 71.08 A: it was uh something that little kids like uh with working papers i think at fifteen were getting 

64.05 64.61 B: (( [noise] )) 

70.91 72.04 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

71.53 82.89 A: but uh for the most part nobody was getting minimum wage in fact most people working at mcdonalds were getting like seven eight or nine dollars an hour and signing bonuses they couldn't find enough people to hold jobs 

82.55 83.71 B: right 

82.94 84.57 A: so they sweetened the pot 

84.54 98.63 A: so i i honestly don't know if raising minimum wage makes sense or not only from a business perspective of a lot more people or a lot more businesses who hire people will hire less people 

99.11 107.58 A: because if they raise the minimum wage um they have to pay that so they're going to hire less people or they're going to lay people off 

109.07 110.12 B: um 

111.07 114.65 B: [noise] well i you know i uh 

114.83 118.12 B: like i said i didn't know that it was so low i can't [noise] 

118.80 123.78 B: um they're gonna just raise it up to five fifteen or five fifty 

123.49 124.48 A: yeah 

124.17 127.73 B: that's just i thought it was more than that now 

127.79 129.74 B: [noise] 'cause i can't see 

129.95 132.38 B: anybody being able to 

132.75 135.75 B: you know support themselves on that [noise] yeah 

135.64 145.73 A: yeah i like i said i don't even know if in fact people uh work at that wage base i know that's the absolute federal wage base minimum 

142.00 143.35 B: (( you're right )) 

146.01 158.70 A: and so like most things with the government almost nobody has that low a standard they usually have a higher standard whether it's for the food you buy you know meat eggs fish 

152.30 153.65 B: oh i see 

158.54 159.81 B: right 

158.75 165.40 A: the federal government has its standard but almost everybody selling something including a job 

163.05 163.61 B: (( mm )) 

165.54 168.90 A: has a different standard that's generally higher 

168.73 169.78 B: yeah 

169.09 174.11 A: so ah you know i don't know that people can live on it and i agree with you 

174.15 180.10 A: and i don't know if anybody is living on it [laughter] i have i have no idea 

176.47 178.65 B: right right it 

179.89 183.40 B: i've never i haven't heard of anybody 

184.31 189.67 B: um you know i don't know of anybody myself that works for minimum wage so 

189.73 192.46 B: maybe just teenagers or 

191.78 206.72 A: do you know any teenagers or kids around you who who do things like maybe they don't have regular hourly rate jobs where they have taxes taken out but maybe they uh mow lawns shovel snow things like that 

206.24 208.59 B: yeah yeah that's true 

207.65 215.72 A: 'cause it seems like kids base it pretty much they seem to be very very much aware of where minimum wage is and what they charge 

215.80 220.50 A: to do these kinds of tasks around the around the property 

217.88 219.32 B: (( mm sure [noise] )) 

221.87 227.75 B: yeah i i really don't know um i don't my kids are young so 

221.98 222.73 A: any 

228.68 230.23 A: what kind of work do you do 

229.64 230.24 B: (( [sigh] [cough] )) 

230.33 234.37 B: i work at home i'm a i work for um 

235.07 236.57 B: internet marketing 

236.21 237.21 A: sure 

237.44 238.74 B: and uh 

238.63 243.53 A: so you don't experience minimum wage do you own your is it your own business 

240.81 241.86 B: no [laughter] 

243.04 244.72 B: yes it is 

243.88 247.95 A: so you pretty much control how much you can make or not make 

247.49 251.91 B: that's right that's right it depends on how much i work or don't work 

248.40 249.38 A: yeah 

251.54 255.47 A: have you ever averaged it out does it come out to more than minimum wage 

256.10 262.68 B: um you know i i never have i think i will do that that's a good idea 

262.37 269.50 A: you might be working below minimum wage yourself [laughter] you never know [laughter] 

263.92 265.74 B: [laughter] i know 

266.74 271.15 B: [laughter] yeah that's true 

269.82 279.41 A: yeah i can remember when i was a kid though when in my early teens we had these jobs where we had to get working papers and they paid us absolutely the minimum 

279.36 288.49 A: uh i think that uh that's the only time i really ever experienced it from then on i was just trying to zoom through the atmosphere of earning money 

279.74 280.55 B: (( mhm )) 

288.18 289.55 B: (( right [noise] )) 

288.62 289.61 A: um 

289.75 303.08 A: but i think it also counts for people like waitresses waiters busboys because in restaurants they don't get minimum wage they get a certain hourly wage and then 

302.96 308.21 A: the owner of the restaurant generally expects they'll make it up in tips 

307.93 309.94 B: (( [mn] oh yeah )) 

308.96 311.51 A: and then they'll have to apply 

311.71 319.09 A: whatever it is they get per hour and then they have to apply tips to that now there is some room for some uh 

319.10 320.67 A: creative accounting 

320.54 322.20 B: right right 

321.13 328.62 A: when they do their taxes but it basically has to equal out to whatever the minimum wage is 

322.70 323.78 B: uh-huh 

328.38 329.93 B: oh i see 

328.76 339.41 A: so i'm not really sure if minimum wage is going to work for them either i think it may be detrimental to them because there's that much more they have to account for from their tip base 

339.51 341.11 B: oh i see 

339.87 344.66 A: when when they uh file their taxes or report their tips 

344.22 345.34 B: uh-huh 

345.25 350.84 A: yeah tipping is a big deal in the waiter industry and with people who are commissioned 

351.11 352.38 A: because [lipsmack] 

351.16 354.19 B: what what um line of work are you in 

354.48 365.19 A: um i actually am a student and i like to do some freelance work so i don't really have a base rate i don't work for anyone i work for myself 

357.22 358.09 B: ah 

364.66 365.68 B: uh-huh 

365.36 376.80 A: um and it's it's i don't even look at minimum wage anymore in terms of how many hours i've worked or what i'm doing that equals minimum wage 

374.55 375.54 B: mhm 

376.88 386.47 A: 'cause the real primary goal was to continue with school and i mean i had i had opportunities to earn i was a former payroll manager 

381.04 382.03 B: right 

386.68 392.16 A: and uh that was a wonderful job but extremely stressful 

392.19 393.42 B: i bet 

392.78 405.45 A: it was stressful 'cause as a payroll manager everybody gets to yell at you whether the employees the bosses your peers you're only as good as your last mistake because it's payroll and it's accounting which is the lesser 

397.06 397.85 B: oh 

405.42 408.69 A: of all evils in business you're an expense 

408.49 409.57 B: right 

409.29 412.36 A: so no one really treats you very well [laughter] 

411.65 413.03 B: [laughter] oh 

413.17 420.53 A: and i got paid very well but after a while the money did not make up for the lack of esteem i felt being in the position 

420.26 421.89 B: oh yeah 

421.52 429.55 A: so i decided to leave go to school and do something else a little more low pressure low key but a little more involved with business 

429.72 433.01 A: and hopefully it'll be for more than minimum wage [laughter] 

432.52 435.58 B: yeah yeah [laughter] 

433.15 438.19 A: [laughter] hopefully i have no idea um 

437.15 444.91 B: [laughter] oh i know i thought it i really thought that it was up like close to seven by now but um 

443.88 452.37 A: no not in this country because of the unemployment situation having to pay out wages for those who are unemployed 

445.35 446.48 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

452.27 461.31 A: uh minimum wage affects a lot of different kinds of small businesses 'cause a lot of small businesses hire people and they pay minimum wage 

456.52 457.65 B: you think that 

459.15 460.05 B: right 

461.38 464.87 A: and they sometimes pay benefits and sometimes not 

464.54 468.22 B: [lipsmack] right i was going to say you know the health insurance too 

467.93 470.21 A: yeah that's a big issue 

468.47 469.27 B: um 

469.83 470.91 B: yes 

470.24 477.38 A: 'cause health insurance is only going up and a lot of people can't afford to have people on a benefit plan 

476.96 478.76 B: right right 

478.59 484.60 A: so we're we're still actually working on paying people minimum wage but paying it on the books 

484.46 485.42 B: right 

484.97 488.23 A: 'cause a lot of businesses are paying minimum wage 

488.28 502.45 A: in the hopes that they can pay them off the books so these people can get money and they can save money you don't have to pay in social security you don't have to pay in medicare the person loses out on social security and medicare but at minimum wage it it's almost irrelevant 

502.22 503.51 B: right 

502.76 515.92 A: because that's money going to the government that for all we know we'll never see again you know i have a few more years before i reach age of collection for social security but i have no confidence that it'll be there when i get there 

514.81 519.35 B: oh sure i know it i know and plus it's really not that much anyway 

519.94 525.49 A: it's um in in the scheme of things you gotta live real small [laughter] real small 

523.77 525.13 B: yes 

525.31 526.52 B: yeah 

525.68 538.05 A: so it's difficult but [lipsmack] i honestly don't know if mini- minimum wage should be increased i i tend to think yes because we just live in more expensive times 

537.85 539.37 B: (( right right )) 

538.38 540.44 A: and i tend to think 

540.31 548.35 A: no only be- only for the impact that it will have overall on all the small businesses in america that are driven 

548.23 561.09 A: by hiring a number of people for lower wages to spread out if you will the amount of jobs at a smaller wage base so that at least everyone within a certain 

557.40 558.37 B: right 

561.16 565.12 A: perimeter or proximity of that business can work 

565.01 566.13 B: right 

565.48 569.97 A: and there's high turnover with minimum wage you don't keep people with that wage 

569.56 570.92 B: yeah that's true 

570.31 572.52 A: (( you know that's definitely )) 

572.73 578.48 A: you're pulling in all the entry entry level of people that's all that you're pulling in 

578.83 587.35 A: and and it turns over 'cause everybody gets real bored real fast with minimum wage and the first thing they do is they go to the next job that pays the next level up a 

587.21 588.43 B: oh sure 

587.70 589.49 A: couple of dollars more 

589.46 590.50 B: sure 

589.50 598.66 A: maybe some benefits maybe some perks whatever this whatever the business sells or services you you get to participate in that 

598.70 599.95 A: so it's tough
