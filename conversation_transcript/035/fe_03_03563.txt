0.31 1.77 A: hi i'm katy 

1.30 3.20 B: uh i'm alise 

4.25 5.20 A: how are you 

4.84 6.87 B: i'm good how about yourself 

5.57 7.43 A: [laughter] i'm okay 

7.10 8.26 B: good 

8.50 11.42 B: so what do you think about the minimum wage increase 

11.10 12.20 A: (( um )) 

13.17 19.06 A: i think it should be more but i probably would always think it should be more so just just because i know there are 

17.07 17.71 B: m- 

20.23 24.88 A: tons of people who have to work entirely too much to support their families 

25.05 25.83 A: so 

26.76 28.95 B: well i absolutely agree with you 

29.12 29.98 B: so 

30.00 40.47 B: yeah i i think that the whole idea that they think that they're doing people a f- a big favor they think that the raise i mean five dollars and fifteen cents is like it's laughable 

40.11 41.12 A: yeah 

40.54 47.36 B: it's just laughable i mean that's ridiculous and there are businesses that actually think that they should be able to pay people less 

47.08 48.09 A: mhm 

47.86 49.96 B: yeah i think it's pretty insane 

50.00 50.90 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

51.42 57.90 B: well we've covered that [laughter] so have you done this befo- have you done this before 

52.70 54.29 A: [laughter] 

54.85 56.66 A: we agree yay 

57.69 62.46 A: yeah i had i had one other phone call before it was about um 

63.50 66.80 A: social vices whether we whether we like 

65.04 65.88 B: huh 

67.11 73.94 A: less smoking drinking gossiping uh overeating and something else i don't know interesting 

72.58 73.27 B: (( hm )) 

74.50 75.47 A: [laughter] 

76.07 79.07 A: i guess we don't have anything more to say about this this subject 

76.08 76.92 B: (( like a )) 

79.55 81.91 B: about uh oh the minimum wage 

81.32 82.19 A: (( yeah i )) 

81.80 96.63 B: no i mean well we pretty much feel the same way about it and it's really inadequate the way it is and that it should be raised it should be raised a lot more than i mean i think that it should be at least seven dollars an hour i mean that 

82.43 83.71 A: think we both agree 

84.77 85.71 A: mhm 

89.83 90.77 A: yeah 

95.10 99.25 A: yeah and like the the raises that they do put in are just like like 

100.28 106.06 A: it's like people playing with politics just like so obvious we'll shut up or something and it 

101.91 102.65 B: (( uh-huh )) 

106.24 107.04 A: (( you know )) 

107.52 108.85 A: (( it's all a big )) 

107.68 108.79 B: well 

109.81 111.03 B: yeah 

110.89 112.03 A: (( game and it's like it )) 

111.40 123.13 B: well i think that that big business would really that you know the biggest businesses that own so many companies a lot of them would really just like to have you know basically slave labor 

122.94 123.79 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

123.40 128.12 B: like mcdonalds i mean those places don't even they don't want to pay minimum 

125.15 125.94 A: (( yes )) 

127.83 134.74 A: yeah and that's why they're all closing their factories and moving them into other countries where they can pay people like ten cents an hour 

134.94 135.84 A: and 

136.06 136.90 A: um 

137.01 140.60 A: wh- which makes people lose jobs in this country and then 

141.23 142.28 A: and then 

142.48 146.01 A: (( everything gets more competitive and yeah big cycle [laughter] )) 

144.68 145.44 B: (( hm ))

158.08 160.88 A: closed their things and they moved their 

161.24 163.54 A: factories and distribution over to 

163.84 167.36 A: other countries where they have to pay where they don't have to pay people as much 

167.47 171.53 B: that figures the new balance shoes are so expensive 

170.89 172.01 A: mhm 

171.70 174.81 B: (( they are just really really expensive ))
