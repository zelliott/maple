1.05 3.87 B: hi my n- hi my name's earl 

1.39 2.40 A: (( hi )) 

3.94 5.42 A: hey earl i'm jason 

5.48 6.60 B: hi jason 

6.59 7.57 A: how's it going 

7.68 9.64 B: all right um 

10.59 14.25 B: so i guess the minimum minimum wage recently went up to five fifteen 

10.82 11.76 A: minimum 

15.18 17.35 A: and do we think it's enough 

16.97 28.95 B: yeah i mean i you know what i i live in southern california and i don't know if it's all of california or just my counties but the minimum wage is six seventy five here [laughter] and it has been for a couple of years so 

28.96 29.81 B: uh 

29.16 35.57 A: yeah i think it's that up here in i'm in seattle and i think that it's like that too i i didn't realize that the 

36.82 39.84 A: that the nationwide average was at 

39.95 44.61 A: uh not i would think that that's not enough [laughter] i mean 

41.06 42.05 B: yeah 

44.63 54.83 B: i guess is depends on where you live you know 'cause 'cause i i i know for example i i've got a lot of friends in montana that i go visit and the cost of living is just so cheap there you know 

55.21 57.91 B: an apart- you can get an apartment for 

58.03 61.37 B: you know three hundred bucks a month or something like that that you might pay 

61.79 65.04 B: you know eight or nine hundred dollars for down in l._a. 

65.69 70.15 A: r- oh yeah yeah seattle's the same way it's expensive to live up here too 

70.42 72.80 A: i guess uh las vegas is kinda like 

73.34 75.35 A: cheap to live too uh 

75.71 77.50 B: is it 

76.70 78.99 A: i don't know if you've been over there uh 

79.10 84.80 B: i i i don't know a lot of people that live there so i don't i don't know what they uh what the rental rates are like 

85.15 86.04 B: but 

85.47 89.03 A: i guess it yeah like you said i guess it depends on uh 

89.59 94.69 A: what the situation is too because a lot of people that make minimum wage are making tips too 

95.95 97.24 A: and they work 

96.24 98.00 B: yeah that's true 

97.45 102.34 A: like waitresses and bartenders and and uh by the time they're done 

102.90 105.99 A: they're making twenty thirty forty bucks an hour so 

105.87 108.67 B: yeah yeah that's a good point 

108.75 110.70 B: i i don't know i mean i 

111.32 115.06 B: i c- it's hard for me to say whether i think it is 

115.56 118.58 B: enough because i i i 

119.50 125.60 B: but if yeah i don't know i mean if you do some math and see get a calculator here so let's say i'm making 

123.72 127.17 A: uh i think i- i think it could be more 

125.69 127.15 B: five fifteen 

127.58 131.27 B: you know five five fifteen an hour okay 

131.34 132.42 A: (( yeah that's )) 

132.16 134.44 B: if you're working forty hours a week 

134.81 136.07 A: not very much 

134.84 137.56 B: it's a little over two hundred bucks a month 

137.69 138.79 B: um 

138.59 139.78 A: you mean a week 

139.02 141.87 B: i mean excuse a week two hundred bucks a week so 

140.36 141.12 A: yeah 

142.93 154.40 B: it's hard to imag- i i mean i see guys that that that look like they're making minimum wage you know just like like some unskilled laborers or illegals or whatever around uh 

154.33 159.06 B: around l._a. and i i wonder sometimes how these guys make it work 

159.42 166.68 B: and like i really wonder how they make it work because i mean eight hundred dollars a month i mean how can live on eight hundred dollars a month 

159.94 160.95 A: yeah 

162.57 163.66 A: well i'm in 

166.80 171.92 A: i've made uh i mean i haven't made five dollars an hour since i was about fourteen years old 

171.14 173.84 B: [laughter] 

172.36 176.41 A: and i'm and i'm thirty two so i can't imagine it either 

174.47 175.75 B: (( yeah )) 

176.09 183.25 B: yeah yeah it's it's crazy and you know the flipside of it though is uh you know 

177.82 178.44 A: (( yeah )) 

182.35 184.64 A: we ought to give 'em this n- number 

184.69 198.02 B: pardon me yeah [laughter] make ten bucks every time you give a have a talk with somebody but you know the the flipside of it from from the point of view of a business owner is that there are certain things that uh 

185.54 187.26 A: (( we ought to give 'em this number )) 

198.03 205.00 B: you know like if somebody's just like washing dishes or you know sweeping up or whatever round around your business 

205.01 208.61 B: i mean it doesn't you know i mean you 

207.62 209.32 A: you can't pay 'em a lot 

208.65 222.30 B: a monk- yeah a monkey with a broom could do it basically you know so you you can't i mean for business owners it's it's hard to uh for certain unskilled things to justify paying somebody a ton of money 'cause 

212.29 213.11 A: right 

222.34 223.39 A: sure 

222.58 224.72 B: you know you can't uh 

225.41 229.54 B: you can't uh and i guess you know people are willing to do it for that cheap 

229.68 234.34 A: so i guess it has to be i would have to say it would have to be adjusted by 

234.48 245.30 A: what kind of job it is because we're probably talking like fast food restaurants but e- damn they're i've seen fast food restaurants they pay they're paying eight bucks an hour i mean a lot of [laughter] 

244.07 245.77 B: yeah 

246.00 246.98 A: so 

247.43 254.03 A: maybe maybe uh the national rate is okay because a lot of restaurants adjust accordingly 

254.51 255.61 B: sure 

254.79 258.08 A: and taste is adjust accordingly al- already so 

258.63 269.69 B: i mean some people say that there should be no national minimum wage at all because you should just sort of let you know supply and demand you know just the basic capitalist system uh 

270.24 275.87 B: you know decide um and i mean 

271.87 272.84 A: right 

277.02 286.90 B: i don't know i mean the part the part of me is totally in favor of at least in principle i can get behind that because i go yeah you know just let 

287.01 297.17 B: you know let this sort of natural system sort it out but then at the same time there's something about like um that that extreme of it that just feels like no 

295.47 296.34 A: yeah 

297.05 298.56 A: that'd be people 

297.45 298.58 B: some kind of 

299.24 303.17 A: there'll be people paying you know people like three bucks an hour [laughter] 

303.19 304.92 A: that are illegal 

303.56 304.80 B: we 

304.92 315.87 B: what i'm saying is jason you know peo- there's there's people that are willing to do it you know there's people that will work for three dollars an hour because they're that like they're that desperate i guess 

308.80 309.77 A: (( i know )) 

316.46 324.42 B: so maybe they think oh i'll just you know do this just for the time being until i can you know get a real job so 

323.80 332.48 A: well no wonder that no wonder people panhandle they're gonna make more than minimum wage they say the average panhandler makes between forth and fifty grand a year 

333.34 334.72 A: [laughter] isn't that insane 

333.57 336.49 B: really where'd you hear that 

336.02 337.29 A: i just 

337.19 346.04 A: it was just a fact i saw somewhere in magazines and you know i've read about it that you know if somebody's good at panhandling they can make a lot of money 

345.80 357.23 A: so they and they you know they just stay purposely they pro- i'd imagine 'em in an apartment you know and they [laughter] put on their druggy stuffy and stay druggy and don't shave and go out there and look pathetic 

355.85 356.85 B: sure 

358.04 360.83 B: yeah yeah 

358.84 361.16 A: there's gotta be people doing that kind of thing 

362.95 364.84 A: why i'd much rather give food 

365.18 369.95 B: yeah it's weird you know i that it makes me think that you know 

370.85 379.96 B: i don't know i mean 'cause if people if people are if people are are you know pitching their spare change to these guys 

379.82 390.50 B: you know like that money that that same amount of money you know that that makes some panhandlers forty or fifty grand a year that same money could be used 

390.86 400.72 B: like whatever you know if the government like had some tax that was set aside to like help get people off the street or help everybody have just kinda basic 

400.77 411.49 B: y- i'm just like if it was if it was like a government subsidized minimum wage or a government subsidized standard of living so that nobody was really having to live underneath the poverty 

411.35 421.11 B: line like there would be government help uh all that money that those that those panhandlers are you know squeezing out of people fifty cents at a time you know 

421.07 430.76 B: would be i don't know i mean i'm not saying i would be in favor of that because i mean you know i think government has a tendency to mess things up pretty bad when they uh 

421.11 422.17 A: right 

430.80 433.66 B: you know when they when they get in that kind of stuff 

432.26 433.19 A: (( stick in )) 

434.14 444.22 B: but i yeah i i feel it's pretty removed from the topic in a way because i'm like you you know like i can't remember the last time i worked for that that little money 

444.24 450.02 A: right well i was talking to a lady the other day and she says they kind of gave you a topic 

450.95 464.52 A: for you something to talk about and then they're studying voice patterns i don't n- i i haven't actually called these people to see exactly what's going on so i i think as long as you're talking i- 

454.72 455.60 B: uh-huh 

464.67 470.99 A: i i was easier i started yesterday it was easier to talk about yesterday's subject 

467.94 469.66 B: me too [laughter] 

471.95 476.48 A: yesterday's subject was easier to talk about like to stay on subject as far as 

472.17 473.09 B: yeah 

477.64 480.47 A: (( minimum wage i know what you're saying um )) 

480.64 483.42 A: kind of a cut and dry issue it's like well 

484.11 485.66 A: do i think it 

485.90 487.31 A: i guess 

488.63 495.39 A: i guess it could go up i guess it could go down a little bit uh all depends on the situation in the state 

495.24 496.17 B: yeah 

496.02 497.12 A: the 

497.15 499.94 A: establishment what [laughter] 

500.42 504.97 A: so maybe it just needs to be uh adjustable [laughter] 

505.33 507.73 A: per state and and situation 

507.94 509.09 A: between 

507.97 509.10 B: i mean i 

509.28 514.00 A: between what it's at and maybe six seventy five or whatever i don't know 

514.34 515.59 A: eight dollars 

514.54 525.58 B: i mean i i what i'm at is i i i started a little retail business uh last christmas it's j- kind of a seasonal thing and when i i think about like minimum wage there's 

525.65 527.52 B: you know there's there's 

528.41 543.17 B: there's no way i would for that minimum wage even at the california minimum wage of six seventy five there is no way i could get somebody who would even be halfway decent 

542.90 543.90 A: right 

543.33 545.61 B: y- i mean so 

545.48 546.88 A: (( you pay at least )) 

547.07 548.91 A: least fifteen twenty right 

549.40 564.33 B: yeah i i mean i was i was doing them ten under the table you know which is which is the equivalent of thirteen to fifteen depending you know on your taxes um because they were just getting cash um yeah you know s- so for for five fifteen an hour i mean 

557.99 558.87 A: (( right )) 

564.88 567.34 B: what are you getting people to do you know 

567.52 568.34 A: right 

567.69 568.57 B: like 

568.63 570.10 A: pick up garbage 

568.89 569.91 B: i guess 

570.05 578.99 B: yeah i guess it's just junk like that you know 'cause even even at uh like you were saying fast food places even at in and out 

572.41 573.38 A: sweep 

578.78 588.48 B: which is i don't know if you got those up in seattle but it's this it's this fast food chain down here that's it's still all family owned use all fresh ingredients it's a pretty cool place 

588.34 589.77 A: like fat burger 

589.71 598.93 B: uh it's yeah kinda like fat burger they uh they pay their people nine bucks an hour to start and you know and that's at a fast food joint 

594.92 595.95 A: (( yep ))
