57.72 68.09 A: i agree yeah i i i don't understand how they can even consider that type of wage it just doesn't i mean it seems to me that uh 

59.11 60.16 B: nobody 

68.11 79.69 A: people are gonna look for other alternatives i i know up here uh sometimes people will just uh stay on the unemployment rather than taking a um yeah and that leads to bigger problems yeah 

74.74 76.22 B: (( [noise] right )) 

76.76 78.24 B: i would 

79.09 83.72 B: you know if it was just a part time on the side job other than your primary job 

83.14 84.39 A: right 

83.80 85.41 B: for extra money 

85.21 86.25 A: (( mhm [mn] [noise] )) 

85.64 97.18 B: you know it could be considered but for your primary to make a living job y- you can't and and then the they got the guidelines so low you can't get government [mn] subsidies with 

97.09 98.02 A: right 

97.44 99.07 B: making that money 

98.42 109.98 A: [mn] right which you're right is another topic you bring up is is quite incredible to me how um you can work at that level and just probably just make too much to get any kind of help 

108.29 110.31 B: dig yourselves deeper in a hole 

110.16 111.36 A: what was that excuse me 

111.02 115.68 B: you're just digging yourself deeper in a hole every month you'll get further and further behind until 

112.93 113.79 A: yes 

114.81 120.18 A: right right and and a big issue up here in new york is um we have a large uh 

116.31 117.01 B: (( [mn] )) 

120.02 127.33 A: immigrant population from russia here by me here in brooklyn and um [mn] when they come over they get um 

127.09 139.26 A: [lipsmack] they get what's called s. s. i. which is uh supplemental income from the government [mn] and they get that for quite a while and they get uh five thousand dollars just for hitting our shores and they get food stamps 

137.10 138.06 B: [laughter] 

139.17 151.27 A: and the poor people here who're just barely making it are just outraged they're like you know we don't want you to treat them badly but we've been slaving over here and just barely making it and you don't help us out at all 

150.67 151.93 B: (( right )) 

151.58 153.31 A: [mn] i don't understand it

161.56 173.23 A: it just it bothers me it really does 'cause some of them come over with some [mn] uh pretty decent possessions and you know they're walking to the local pharmacy with a mink coat and they'll use their food stamps [laughter] 

172.51 173.43 B: oh good 

173.24 182.94 A: and it really you know it i just bothers me that uh people that have lived there all uh lived here all their life and worked hard and are just making it you know can't get any help 

182.39 185.14 B: go- right i would be very upset too [noise] 

184.14 188.18 A: [mn] yeah yeah so that's that's kind of what we're dealing with over here

203.73 217.66 A: [lipsmack] [mn] i'm not i'm not talking for all of them but there's quite a few that work in our our local diners here and [mn] and i have a feeling that they don't have green cards and i have also have a feeling that they don't make much money at all [mn] if even minig- minimum wage 'cause they're here illegally 

214.39 215.39 B: (( [noise] right [noise] ))

247.95 249.41 B: [laughter] [noise] [noise] 

252.10 262.14 A: [mn] i [mn] on one hand i don't blame people you know you hear that they're spending uh three hundred dollars on a hammer you know at the government and you're like boy that's my money you know [mn] 

261.52 262.67 B: (( right [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

262.10 270.57 A: yeah well you know they i don't understand why they have all these uh appropriations but [mn] you know you get that list i think um

298.40 299.26 B: oh 

298.66 305.14 A: yeah because um i mean they're they're cracking down over here you can't smoke not even in bars anymore 

304.38 314.27 B: [noise] well i won't even i won't patronize i don't smoke but i will not patronize non fucking smoking facilities 'cause i mean it's legal and it's a right 

307.09 308.50 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

311.77 312.71 A: right 

313.96 316.19 A: uh-huh [mn] oh ay- yeah

318.17 331.05 A: i agree i agree but yeah you know in new york now it's um no smoking in bars no smoking in public places and you have all these poor employees outside their buildings in the freezing weather in the winter just trying to uh 

319.58 320.39 B: (( you know [noise] )) 

330.86 334.46 A: smoke a cigarette on their break it's it's really getting pretty crazy 

334.55 346.30 A: [mn] but um anyway back [laughter] to the topic i guess we kinda strayed a little bit yeah i'm with you uh i i can't imagine anything under maybe seven fifty eight dollars an hour and even that's cutting it kind of low 

336.59 337.59 B: (( yeah )) 

345.26 350.13 B: [noise] [mn] right i just i don't [mn] i just don't understand how people live 

349.48 351.69 A: i don't either i really don't 

350.50 354.33 B: uh i mean i have a hard time living on what i do and 

353.64 355.09 A: (( right [mn] )) 

354.55 359.44 B: you know i mean tha- that just gives up that the opportunity to ever have a home 

359.07 359.93 A: right 

359.49 361.41 B: or anything 

361.24 362.24 A: i know 

362.14 371.43 A: [mn] it it's really it really is sad i i just can't yeah i mean [mn] but even the housing costs here have skyrocketed uh i mean a house that you could get 

371.22 385.26 A: for maybe a hundred and fifty thousand uh maybe three years ago is going for like three hundred thousand now [mn] so so how do you how do you even have that dream on minimum wage to possibly buy a house you it's like getting impossible 

376.39 378.46 B: (( [mn] oh no )) 

383.28 383.87 B: (( [noise] )) 

385.00 390.40 B: right because even [mn] one that they say i qualify for i couldn't buy [mn] 

389.97 391.22 A: yeah 

390.66 392.17 B: 'cause i could never make 

392.02 392.90 A: right 

392.32 395.85 B: you know wanna make those kind of payments and 

395.25 403.90 A: yeah [mn] yeah and the people here a lot of them um [lipsmack] the the mothers don't stay home anymore it's impossible if you want a home 

396.21 397.61 B: stuff like that [mn] 

403.80 406.99 A: for your children and to just have a a decent living 

406.80 410.17 A: uh both the husband and the wives work here and uh 

409.93 422.78 A: makes it tough on the kids and um a lot of them just just barely make the their mortgage payments god forbid there are any emergencies that go on or they need a new car [mn] uh it's it's getting kinda tough [mn] 

422.98 424.14 A: yeah 

423.58 426.74 B: i just i i i agree i don't see how 

426.99 439.09 B: how the government can do that i mean i understand there's small companies that [mn] can't afford to pay and but they should get part time people that are doing just want side you know 

428.73 429.65 A: yeah 

436.25 437.14 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

438.81 439.65 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

439.51 444.07 B: extra money besides what they're making or kids from high school or 

443.82 445.03 A: right right 

444.29 447.77 B: you know kids in college and things like that [mn] 

446.12 447.03 A: right 

448.05 450.80 B: i could see that that kinda wage 

450.34 451.48 A: (( [mn] right )) 

450.88 453.05 B: but for for your 

453.73 455.40 B: primary salary 

455.45 456.37 A: yeah 

455.65 456.99 B: there's no way 

456.56 464.96 A: no there is no way [mn] and um there i think that is the argument on the other side is that um if you raise the minimum wage that um 

464.82 472.82 A: a lot of people end up losing their jobs in smaller companies because the smaller companies uh can't pay more money for minimum wage 

472.75 487.52 A: um [lipsmack] i don't know if that's a good argument or not i mean unless maybe like you were you were saying maybe it's a good idea to say you know minimum wage can only you know be given to certain people like college students or [mn] part timers or something like that 

485.51 486.55 B: (( right )) 

486.91 495.73 B: or or like i had to work night shift a person that wants just a straight eight hour a day monday to friday job you know that sort of thing 

489.24 490.14 A: uh-huh 

493.55 494.47 A: uh-huh 

495.11 497.33 A: right right but yeah 

495.90 497.59 B: [noise] but that you know 

497.62 501.47 B: i would take a cut in pay for that not not that low [laughter] 

500.87 502.72 A: right no not that low 

502.22 506.52 B: but you know for for some wives it would benefit them to do that 

505.98 507.79 A: right right 

507.10 512.30 B: just to bring in extra money and and be at home in the afternoons and 

508.97 509.95 A: mhm 

511.61 515.31 A: right [mn] yeah so i guess i guess in some ways too 

512.55 513.94 B: things like that 

514.21 516.11 B: you know you could find people that 

516.38 519.39 B: would work for a lower amount for certain benefits you 

518.73 521.08 A: mhm yeah 

520.51 525.04 B: know 'cause that [mn] 'cause now all companies around here is twenty four seven
