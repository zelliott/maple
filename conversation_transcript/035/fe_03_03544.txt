5.45 6.91 B: yeah that's better 

6.27 8.00 A: okay good [laughter] 

7.14 9.55 B: [laughter] my name is jill smith 

9.22 11.82 A: [mn] and my name is julie acuff 

11.54 12.58 B: julie 

12.13 13.18 A: yes 

12.76 14.07 B: hi julie 

13.44 15.39 A: [mn] hi how are you [mn] 

14.81 16.01 B: i'm fine 

15.50 20.23 A: good and i live in chattanooga tennessee so i'm like a southerner [laughter]

22.61 27.80 A: oh well hey another southerner [laughter] not by birth well me neither i'm a 

24.07 28.64 B: well not by birth but by [laughter] but by residence [laughter] 

28.06 33.21 A: i'm a born yankee so [laughter] [mn] displaced yankee i guess [laughter] 

29.22 30.56 B: oh right oh 

32.38 34.57 B: right most of us are i guess 

34.17 41.45 A: yeah [mn] oh gosh minimum wage how do i feel you know i've never made minimum wage [laughter] [mn] i've always made more [mn] 

39.50 51.31 B: [cough] well that that sounds like you've made you mean you've made more than minimum wage right right [mn] i guess we'll have to try and put ourselves in the shoes of those who do or [mn] what we've heard about it 

43.30 45.41 A: yes more [laughter] 

47.96 49.21 A: that's right 

50.46 62.26 A: [mn] that's right and you know i guess i've always felt if they would raise it maybe we would have less people on welfare [mn] you know it would maybe purs- make people want to go out and and work 

61.84 63.07 B: hm oh 

62.25 67.90 A: and get a and get a job you know if they have no education you know their only alternative 

64.05 64.84 B: (( yeah )) 

67.59 68.57 B: mhm 

67.97 81.87 A: you know nowadays is really you know flipping hamburgers or [mn] you know something along those lines and you know when they can make more sitting at home on welfare then they can make [mn] you know by actually going out and getting a job 

71.19 72.23 B: (( mhm )) 

81.59 82.63 B: mhm 

82.17 83.48 A: you know that's kinda 

83.49 85.72 A: [mn] seems seems wrong [laughter] 

83.64 96.59 B: well i'd like to see uh i'd like to see along with that [mn] more provision made for them to increase their educational opportunities with daycare with some sort of uh assistance 

90.75 92.92 A: [noise] [mn] yeah exactly 

94.26 95.18 A: right 

95.90 97.83 A: yeah and incentive yeah 

96.50 102.85 B: so that you know they could move on not that they had [mn] any ambition [laughter] whatsoever 

99.76 100.60 A: right 

101.45 102.29 A: yeah 

102.39 103.68 A: exactly 

103.05 109.15 B: that's right but from what i've heard it's difficult and when you look at the cost of living 

104.11 105.33 A: [mn] that's true 

107.04 107.92 A: yeah 

109.18 119.58 B: uh and what they have to if they have to have daycare it negates a good deal of what they have even with an increase in the minimum wage so 

118.48 128.29 A: yeah well and that's true because you know even your average bank teller i think makes somewhere like between six and seven and after you pay daycare you're not 

125.01 125.93 B: mhm 

128.39 135.06 A: it there's there's no you're not making any money i mean you're basically working just to get out of the house 

131.00 131.89 B: mm 

134.45 135.57 B: mhm 

135.17 141.32 A: i mean by the time you pay for the clothing and the food for eating out and you know daycare you don't [noise] 

138.41 139.05 B: yeah 

141.33 148.32 A: when i had a daughter in daycare i think i paid and this has been a couple of years ago i paid seventy five dollars 

149.03 152.91 A: no it was ninety dollars a week i paid ninety dollars a week for daycare 

150.52 151.43 B: mhm 

152.47 153.64 B: mhm 

153.01 157.38 A: and so basically i had to work two days 

157.54 161.77 A: you know after you take out taxes and insurance [noise] to pay for daycare 

159.55 160.35 B: (( yeah )) 

161.29 162.25 B: mhm 

162.04 167.96 A: and then when you clo- factor in clothing you just can't get up and put anything on [laughter] [mn] 

166.86 181.08 B: well i've been out of that bracket for some time i know some companies do have onsite daycare [mn] which certainly helps um psychologically physically [mn] uh travel wise and uh and presumably they're that can 

169.40 170.23 A: yeah 

171.89 172.79 A: yeah 

173.67 174.68 A: yeah 

175.32 176.29 A: mhm 

177.99 178.90 A: right 

180.01 180.89 A: mhm 

180.85 191.36 B: the cost is then [mn] subsidized to a degree by the company of course small businesses [mn] if perhaps they could ban together and do that even if they're not a large company 

182.27 183.54 A: (( yeah right that's )) 

191.12 202.40 B: i just think the government could do more to subsidize and assist these things [mn] not to manage it themselves but to give encouragement [mn] to small business to be able to do that 

195.57 196.62 A: (( right yeah )) 

202.20 203.20 A: yeah 

202.48 206.46 B: or even i don't know what mcdonalds as a giant company 

206.48 212.41 B: but certainly they make enough money [laughter] that uh [mn] i would think they'd be able to do it 

209.21 210.11 A: yeah 

211.38 218.78 A: well yeah and if you think about it the average person working eight hour d- eight hours a day if they're making minimum wage that's just forty dollars a day 

218.35 219.20 B: (( mhm )) 

218.86 222.87 A: that's not even barely fills up your gas tank and gets groceries for 

222.21 223.39 B: (( that's right )) 

222.92 224.63 A: [noise] you know for a day 

224.31 225.14 B: yeah 

224.95 227.93 A: i mean that's yeah it's not a whole lot of money 

226.44 235.69 B: well i've heard pro and con uh the things i've heard against it [mn] uh i think mainly from the republicans and probably primarily from them 

235.48 242.52 B: [mn] is that it would the small businesses again couldn't afford it but there is where government certainly could help 

240.06 240.96 A: true 

242.13 243.22 A: could help 

242.63 250.25 B: i'd rather see them spend that then spend it on a whole lot of armaments and [mn] [laughter] technological weapons 

243.34 244.25 A: yeah 

249.93 251.05 A: yeah 

250.34 256.33 B: i i really would i think the human element definitely takes back seat to these things 

251.84 252.77 A: yeah 

256.04 257.17 A: oh it does 

256.12 267.25 B: and it seems every generation we've got some [mn] uh big uh monster out there waiting to attack us and therefore we have to spend billions [laughter] to protect ourselves 

265.60 268.14 A: oh yeah to protect ourselves 

267.69 277.95 B: and even when uh this low tech monster attacked us [mn] uh they still went at it that way but [mn] you know i don't know i think most women 

275.05 275.96 A: mhm 

277.97 283.42 B: don't agree with uh that those priorities i venture to say 

281.48 282.32 A: yeah 

283.05 290.38 A: yeah most women are more of a a a feely type issues you know you know issues that affect the family and the home 

287.53 288.82 B: well i mean i 

289.24 299.78 B: right right and uh you know they're trying to do their best to protect that end of it and uh then you get things that [mn] just seem to work against that 

294.68 295.55 A: right 

295.59 296.41 A: right 

299.71 300.83 A: yeah 

300.31 314.04 B: although uh going into the military certainly is a big help to low wage people gives them an education and you know provided we don't send them off to war which seems to happen every twenty years or less 

305.99 307.07 A: that's true 

307.46 308.35 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

313.66 314.76 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

314.57 324.00 B: but it still is something in a way the government is subsidizing that so [mn] i don't know what the big argument is against government we seem to put a lot of 

319.02 319.95 A: mhm 

323.81 331.58 B: faith and trust in the military which is certainly a big government program [mn] so i don't like to see you know more things done 

327.79 328.74 A: yeah 

331.55 343.39 B: to help people out of the box that they maybe have gotten in through just generations or being raised like that or mishaps or who knows what 

343.68 350.16 A: [mn] yeah and i think uh and plus we're like a different type of generation we're dealing with [mn] i mean because 

347.37 348.40 B: mhm 

350.59 351.19 B: (( [cough] )) 

350.76 362.41 A: it seems like the kids that are coming into the w- you know that are coming into that work force you know now have a different mentality than what people had [mn] twenty years ago [mn] 

361.85 363.02 B: mhm 

362.39 376.34 A: and and that has a lot to do with it kids now seem like they want [noise] well you know something for nothing you know they they expect to make the big bucks right off the bat and it's just not that way [laughter] 

372.15 373.96 B: mhm mhm 

375.32 381.49 B: well i think unfortunately some of our uh entertainment shows things that are 

377.17 378.03 A: yeah 

380.74 381.95 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

381.35 384.48 B: not realistic to them and they don't realise 

384.34 397.36 B: that in back of all that if you want to make something of yourself unless you've inherited a lot or won the lottery or what have you which is a little unlikely [laughter] that you do have to have some discipline it's not a dirty word 

389.08 389.98 A: right 

391.04 391.93 A: right 

393.00 393.97 A: yeah 

396.68 409.37 A: exactly and you have to have initiative [mn] if to work you you have to wanna go to school [mn] you have to buckle down you have to study y- you know you don- you can't expect to walk in to a place and be a manager 

397.56 398.60 B: yeah 

399.75 403.95 B: yeah that's true you have to be able right that's right 

409.26 421.75 A: in six months you've got to w- you've got to work at it you know you've got to be at work on time you've got to be a good employee [mn] and you know nowadays you know people just don't seem to wanna do that [mn] 

409.26 410.10 B: right 

410.33 411.20 B: yeah 

416.07 417.21 B: (( that's right )) 

421.48 432.10 B: [mn] well i've heard that uh i don't know really how true it is you know if you look at numbers it's very hard to tell [mn] you hear some uh employers say 

429.02 430.24 A: yeah it is 

431.99 445.21 B: especially perhaps small business where [mn] they can't afford to draw from a pool of college graduates or 'cause they don't have that to offer [mn] and the young people if they're not taught either at home or in school 

438.84 439.77 A: mhm 

445.28 460.12 B: then where are they gonna get it from i don't think they're gonna get it from watching cartoons and [laughter] television [laughter] i don't think they're going to get [mn] and again i think the problem is that discipline is should not be thought of as a dirty word or [mn] some sort of punishment 

447.08 447.88 A: right 

449.79 450.71 A: no 

451.06 452.48 A: no definitely 

457.76 458.89 A: mhm 

459.93 460.80 A: yeah 

460.17 465.98 B: it it just means that you have to realise there's a uh a system to things and follow through 

465.97 467.28 A: yeah 

466.49 480.34 B: [mn] but i think they're not too often too many are not getting it and they live in maybe you know ghettoized communities where they don't they have very little in the way of role models that are positive 

478.40 479.40 A: yeah 

480.11 491.77 A: [mn] and it's a cycle you know usually that type of a lifestyle has kids that end up in that type of a lifestyle unless they're just [mn] you know just super ambitious and want to better themselves 

481.64 482.91 B: (( [mn] that's right )) 

486.35 487.13 B: yeah 

491.38 492.18 B: right 

491.94 493.08 A: and um 

492.18 507.10 B: it's easier to go out and rob from somebody else then to [laughter] make an effort yourself [mn] and i think most people are touched by that in some way there's hardly anybody you can meet that hasn't suffered to a burglary or a robbery or some such thing like that 

494.68 495.49 A: yeah 

497.30 498.17 A: yeah 

504.64 505.52 A: yeah 

506.62 507.93 A: [mn] yeah and you know 

506.95 510.51 B: and that was never true years ago never 

509.08 510.07 A: mhm 

510.53 512.12 A: yeah and maybe 

511.02 512.96 B: [mn] so what [laughter] 

512.14 514.41 A: a higher minimum wage would help that 

514.18 528.07 B: well again not without learn not without the the the discipline the opportunity and you can't force people to take advantage of opportunities but certainly can encourage that 

518.29 519.86 A: the disci- yeah 

523.61 524.50 A: no 

525.44 526.30 A: right 

527.44 528.55 A: yeah 

528.71 540.68 B: and and i don't think there are any easy answers [mn] there's nothing that's like a magic bullet that's going to solve it [mn] but certainly for the working poor it probably would help somewhat [mn] with 

535.10 536.09 A: right 

539.76 540.68 A: mhm 

540.60 548.66 B: other subsidized things as we talked about without that a uh a couple of bucks more [mn] an hour is not going to do it 

548.04 549.43 A: is not gonna do it 

548.77 550.15 B: no that's right 

550.12 555.24 A: [mn] but yeah if they're not gonna work for five fifteen they're sure not gonna work for six fifteen [laughter] 

554.27 567.88 B: [laughter] but uh i'm sure that great minds have thought about this the uh the late senator um [lipsmack] i'm trying to think of his moynahan [mn] wrote about this many years ago 

555.75 556.62 A: yeah 

564.71 565.93 A: moynahan yeah 

567.66 568.43 A: hm 

567.83 580.65 B: about what was happening and all of these issues and i i can't tell you i remember exactly what i said but i know he had very sensible things to say and plenty of warnings about you know what would happen 

572.01 572.98 A: really 

576.78 577.82 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

580.44 585.34 B: uh to that segment of the uh country if something wasn't done 

580.68 581.71 A: yeah 

585.00 586.14 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

586.01 588.69 B: and i think they have done some things 

588.58 589.50 A: yeah 

589.43 599.44 B: but [mn] you know i don't know whether it's enough or not i know there's plenty of [mn] community colleges and seems like there's a lot out there but again 

595.63 597.01 A: [mn] oh yeah 

597.92 599.89 A: [mn] and there's a l- you know and there's gra-
