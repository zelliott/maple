5.15 7.85 B: and uh what do you think about this topic 

7.18 13.63 A: uh i think that it's not enough especially for some of the lines of work i 

13.89 19.37 A: mean you can have a job where you're busting your butt all day long for five fifteen an hour 

20.52 21.16 A: (( [noise] )) 

21.08 32.04 B: yes i i feel the same way i don't think it's anywhere near adequate because in real dollars our minimum wage has gone down greatly in the last few years 

31.41 34.00 A: yeah 'cause all the new taxes 

32.48 35.81 B: we don't it it isn't worth what it used to be at all [lipsmack]

42.29 43.26 A: yeah 

42.66 52.12 B: and then i heard him say on the television that he did not believe there should be a minimum wage at all and that killed him as far as i was concerned [laughter]

66.34 67.55 B: mhm 

67.76 71.51 A: and i mean i was working my butt off on those jobs for a 

70.52 71.46 B: mhm 

71.59 74.09 A: hundred fifty dollars a week 

73.48 74.78 B: mhm 

75.00 76.66 B: well uh 

76.63 90.00 B: i'm much older so i remember when the minimum wage was was very very low and uh i heard tales uh in the past uh about how a big store opened in the city where 

89.91 98.19 B: where i lived when i was just you know too young to know myself and they and uh apparently there wasn't any minimum wage at that time 

97.98 99.02 B: and uh 

98.85 113.20 B: they called people together who wanted to work in the store and they said how cheap will you work one person would say i'll work for a dollar an hour and another would say i'll work for seventy five and then someone would say i'll work for fifty cents an hour that was way back you know years ago 

111.79 112.89 A: (( yeah )) 

113.05 118.98 B: and they said that's how that store hired people uh just picked the ones that would work for the lowest pay 

118.77 120.39 A: (( yeah )) 

119.92 125.13 B: and i also live in a small town where the minimum wage is the wage 

125.89 131.42 B: you know you move to a little town where there isn't isn't much opportunity for jobs and uh 

132.60 134.97 B: the minimum wage is what they'll offer 

134.89 135.84 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

136.88 141.38 B: have do you live in a big city where there's lots of competition for jobs or 

138.71 139.51 A: (( oh )) 

140.91 143.02 A: yeah yeah new york 

142.43 149.02 B: oh new york of course pay is much higher in new york i'm sure than it is in little california towns

164.29 165.12 B: oh 

165.31 172.17 B: california usually has uh a minimum wage that's higher than uh than the than the federal minimum wage 

173.69 184.00 B: but i know some states i think arizona's one of 'em h- have have uh as far as the state jobs are concerned have very uh low minimum wages 

183.76 194.66 A: yeah like people you know like some people have hard getting into businesses and they're stuck working in minimum wage jobs 

191.06 192.26 B: mhm 

194.26 195.57 B: mhm 

194.86 198.61 A: and they can't make you can't make a living off that 

196.18 197.61 B: [lipsmack] oh if you 

198.03 203.71 B: yeah you can you could hardly support yourself on uh federal minimum wage let alone support a family 

202.60 206.55 A: and like i'm making i work fifty hours a week eight dollars 

205.84 207.43 B: how many how many hours 

206.67 207.77 A: fifty 

207.44 208.65 B: oh fifty 

208.35 210.57 A: yeah making eight dollars an hour 

210.02 211.55 B: mhm 

211.04 214.20 A: and rent in new york's outrageous like 

214.50 216.92 A: like about fifteen d- 

216.93 223.25 A: one thousand five hundred a month for rent and so yeah 

218.95 219.99 B: mhm 

220.79 222.26 B: oh oh 

222.31 224.78 B: right you live right in new york city then 

224.49 225.58 A: yeah 

224.99 236.01 B: mhm yeah i living expenses must be very high i know in san francisco the living expenses are just so high [laughter] very few people can afford to live right in the city 

235.55 238.36 A: and then you got the food bills you 

237.30 238.64 B: mhm 

238.98 240.41 B: mhm 

239.79 245.02 A: (( know and every week i have like [mn] five dollars left to my name )) 

244.44 245.68 B: yeah 

245.91 253.23 B: yeah that that is very difficult and then you have to pay taxes in new york city on your wages too don't you 

252.89 254.30 A: yeah 

253.69 257.36 B: yeah that that they don't have fortunately here [laughter] 

256.90 259.85 A: they take off like ten different taxes 

259.29 260.45 B: uh-huh 

260.97 263.46 A: (( which is it's it's crazy uh )) 

262.48 265.74 B: mhm what do you think the minimum wage should be 

265.60 268.54 A: it depends on the line of work 

268.54 270.01 B: oh mhm 

270.70 276.72 B: but i mean the minimum that people should be paid or you think it maybe it should be varied depending upon the job huh 

276.21 282.11 A: yeah like mcdonalds you can't go to mcdonalds and expect to be paid nine dollars an hour 

281.52 283.86 B: well that's true mhm 

283.98 291.13 B: yeah yeah that's that's a novel idea i hadn't heard that expressed before that they should have a different minimum wage for uh 

291.24 293.36 B: for uh different skills 

293.27 295.02 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

295.73 302.01 A: it it should depend on the line of work and depend on how much the minimum wage is 

299.51 300.59 B: mhm 

302.19 307.84 B: uh-huh well of course where there are unions they do set their minimum wages for their certain crafts 

307.41 309.48 A: yeah 

309.66 310.81 B: but uh 

310.93 311.76 B: uh 

311.94 317.79 B: non-union jobs i guess revert to the minimum minimum wage the federal one 

320.43 321.74 B: so uh 

321.85 326.28 B: do you think that's likely to happen that the that that they'll raise the minimum wage 

327.48 332.21 A: (( yeah the economy's going down not in the future )) 

332.35 333.96 B: mhm 

335.22 337.22 B: how far in the future [laughter] 

337.57 341.46 A: i'd say uh maybe about five years they'll raise it again 

341.13 341.95 B: oh 

342.09 347.14 B: probably our inflation will have gone up enough to to make up the difference then [laughter] 

347.35 351.13 B: so so it really won't i read somewhere that uh 

351.15 364.04 B: uh that the minimum if if we got the same minimum wage in regard to buying power that they had twenty years ago that that it would probably be up as high as fifteen dollars an hour [laughter] 

363.64 364.76 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

364.12 366.61 B: to to the equivalent buying power 

367.73 372.55 B: i imagine a dollar doesn't go very far in uh in new york either [laughter] 

371.97 373.92 A: nope 

374.17 380.96 B: i've only been to new york once when i went to go on a a trip and we went through new york city 

382.36 388.40 B: but uh are there is there great competition for jobs there do they have a lotta people laid off too 

395.03 396.23 B: probably 

395.17 399.45 A: (( well yeah i mean the minimum wage is too low )) 

397.38 398.43 B: mhm 

399.25 401.10 B: mhm it's too low 

401.31 405.50 B: uh do most companies there though pay more than the minimum wage 

405.14 406.23 A: uh 

406.31 409.28 A: most of them do but not all of them 

408.66 409.82 B: mhm 

410.63 415.52 B: uh even i think even mcdonalds here pays a little more than the minimum 

415.01 419.75 A: yeah like my one of my last jobs i was working at mcdonalds i was 

418.97 420.04 B: mhm 

419.90 422.26 A: (( making six twenty five an hour )) 

422.45 426.52 B: oh yeah higher than the minimum that's probably about what they pay here 

424.75 425.41 A: (( yeah )) 

425.99 429.95 A: but i had prior experience so two years back 

427.90 429.02 B: mhm 

429.33 435.07 B: yeah but you'd you'd think where the living expenses are so much higher that they would pay more 

434.92 436.29 A: yeah 

435.62 443.47 B: mhm i think they definitely should raise the the the minimum wage raise it a lot what do you think they should raise it to about 

439.75 440.70 A: yeah like 

443.47 444.94 A: (( uh )) 

444.95 447.92 B: the minimum you know the the lowest for the lowest 

447.27 448.29 A: ten 

448.17 448.91 B: (( huh )) 

448.64 449.57 A: ten 

449.27 451.74 B: ten uh-huh yeah i 

451.83 454.40 B: actually i think if it would if they were to 

454.62 459.06 B: you know pay enough for a person to live it probably should be twelve [laughter] 

458.65 466.09 A: yeah like i'm struggling just to make ends meet i'm working an extra job on the weekends 

465.81 466.81 B: uh-huh 

466.78 472.27 A: and i i have a fiance and i have like i i hardly see her 

471.97 476.06 B: mhm oh yeah you're working seven days a week 

472.97 473.87 A: (( 'cause i'm just )) 

475.73 476.50 A: (( yes )) 

476.63 484.15 B: well when you say you work fifty hours but don't you get time i mean in your regular job don't you get time and a half for that last ten hours 

483.50 487.25 A: yeah yeah and i'm still struggling 

484.52 485.43 B: you do 

486.64 489.15 B: (( yeah yeah i mean one would )) 

488.92 492.74 A: yeah i'm even struggling working the extra job on the weekends 

492.55 493.58 B: mhm 

494.19 503.89 B: yeah well i moved from a from a city to a small town and my my salary went down by two thirds because all they were paying was the minimum 

503.95 506.19 B: in the little town that i moved to 

507.00 511.46 A: yeah right but in the little towns the rents are so ch- a lot cheaper then 

510.88 518.04 B: yeah they are they're cheaper but but still the the salaries are are lower in the small towns 

516.06 516.96 A: (( yeah )) 

517.34 520.19 A: like we plan on moving to a small town 

519.85 520.92 B: mhm 

520.23 523.51 A: that's like maybe forty five minutes from a big city 

523.14 524.35 B: mhm 

523.76 527.00 A: and just i would travel back and forth every day 

526.97 529.23 B: yeah that's expensive 

530.59 534.93 B: can you travel though uh on trains there or do you have to drive 

534.48 536.52 A: (( uh i use the train [noise] can )) 

536.21 537.38 B: mhm 

538.29 541.63 B: but i i suppose the the train fares have been going up too 

542.96 544.17 A: (( you hang on one sec )) 

544.22 544.91 B: (( huh )) 

547.52 548.27 A: (( [noise] )) 

548.97 550.97 A: yeah 

549.66 551.08 B: mhm 

551.26 552.33 A: so 

552.46 554.54 A: like they just raised uh 

555.07 556.15 A: um 

555.13 555.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

556.67 557.85 B: mhm 

557.21 558.48 A: bus fares

566.87 569.63 A: now it's twenty seven dollars a week 

569.03 572.35 B: mhm oh my that's an awful lot 

572.78 580.66 B: so that has to come out of your your wage actually people should have a higher minimum there where transportation is so expensive 

579.81 581.55 A: yeah 

581.92 582.97 A: and then 

583.20 587.22 A: lunch and stuff 'cause i'm a security guard you

588.51 594.89 A: know i mean the line of work i'm in i should get more than eight dollars an hour 'cause i'm risking my life 

592.68 593.54 B: oh 

594.29 596.59 B: why sure absolutely 

596.87 599.89 B: it should depend upon the hazard they should have extra
