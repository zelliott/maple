120.04 121.13 B: mhm 

122.31 133.85 A: [mn] it's like you know we're right outside of the city it's about a half hour commute so it's kinda like you're in a suburban area but you can get into the you know that's where most people do work is in the city [noise] 

126.54 127.50 B: (( [noise] uh-huh ))

173.78 175.22 B: right 

175.96 182.57 B: right i don't know how i don't either i can't imagine my daughter makes [noise] that much or more babysitting you know

182.92 184.16 B: yeah 

183.44 198.25 A: i pay my babysitter like seven dollars an hour [mn] you know and [mn] and it kills me to go out because if i go out to a movie and dinner and then leaving the babysitter costs me like seventy sixty seventy dollars 

186.33 187.82 B: uh-huh 

190.57 193.34 B: right [laughter] 

194.15 194.72 B: (( [mn] )) 

195.14 196.22 B: right

201.20 202.24 B: yeah 

202.34 203.65 B: (( uh-huh )) 

203.78 211.05 B: and then i guess if you make minimum wage then you have taxes taken out of what you make that that's terrible 

208.14 209.26 A: right 

210.46 213.88 A: your left with like four dollars and change 

212.29 215.91 B: yeah that's that's bad 

215.14 229.27 A: [mn] that is really sad [mn] if [mn] and you think that you know b- well the people that do that are making the laws they have no concept really of what it's like i mean if they were [mn] to live like as a normal person [mn] 

216.65 218.23 B: mhm 

229.24 241.02 A: would they would kind of realise that the money doesn't really go very far but all of the you know all the people in congress and i mean they don't know they're they're living like you know a great life [mn] and they have 

232.84 233.96 B: mhm 

236.81 238.17 B: right 

239.52 244.07 B: right yeah they d- they don't have a clue how the n- the normal person 

241.46 242.87 A: (( they don't )) 

244.13 245.82 B: (( [mn] lives )) 

245.18 258.96 A: if they were given a budget of what a normal person goes through and what they do per day or even per week they wouldn't be i don't think they would make it or they would [mn] like have to raise the minimum wage they would realise [mn] 

257.41 258.46 B: right 

259.29 261.94 A: what was going on in their world 

261.23 262.42 B: (( right [noise] )) 

262.21 269.73 A: but it's just i'm i i can't see anyone doing it i mean it's just not even [mn] department stores and um 

270.06 276.88 A: and you said fast food it would be also like movie theater it would be like anything that you would like go to 

273.74 274.60 B: (( mm )) 

276.53 277.80 B: right 

278.39 283.06 A: really it's i mean i can't even think about it [laughter] [noise] [mn] 

282.85 285.21 B: no i can't either it's 

285.49 292.94 B: it would not be enough to you couldn't have a family or a nice house you couldn't you couldn't afford anything 

292.68 300.92 A: well that's i went to school i became a teacher [mn] but i ended up staying at home with my kids so [laughter] it's like [laughter] 

297.70 300.11 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

301.01 302.30 B: (( that's good )) 

301.04 311.05 A: but i always knew like to pay for that even though it's not the best like it would always be a good job to have like there you know that they're always looking for teachers 

310.62 311.70 B: right 

310.92 317.11 A: and that you know if i was to have a family and [noise] go go to work like i would have my summers off 

316.45 317.81 B: right 

317.08 331.11 A: and that the vacations would coincide [noise] [mn] so somebody who was working for minimum [noise] wage let's say you know they had kids [noise] and they can't afford you know to take off or [mn] you know when they have their kids home it's like what do they do [noise] [mn] 

326.50 327.79 B: mhm 

329.18 330.32 B: right 

330.40 336.81 B: yeah you have to pay a babysitter then and once you do that yeah 

332.31 344.67 A: [noise] i know and it's [mn] a- as as we were saying that [noise] you know paying for the babysitter wouldn't even cover probably what they were making which is so sad you're paying out practically what you're making per hour [mn] 

337.51 339.16 B: exactly 

339.30 341.02 B: right you wouldn't even 

343.01 345.47 B: exactly right 

344.68 346.60 A: that it wouldn't even [noise] pay 

346.31 352.32 B: it wouldn't pay to go to work yeah exactly [laughter] 

347.30 350.93 A: go to work [laughter] [noise] not at all [noise] 

351.32 353.47 A: (( it wouldn't pay to go to work [noise] [noise] )) 

352.41 362.49 B: uh-huh no no it wouldn't i think in a lot of circumstances it doesn't you know what women are paying for the babysitter and then paying for convenience foods 

354.21 355.13 A: (( [mn] )) 

362.47 368.61 B: i think a lot of [mn] women that do want to work they don't make any money hardly 

366.80 367.77 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

368.12 369.92 A: (( [noise] no not at all [noise] )) 

369.05 373.61 B: you know with what you have to cover in expenses [noise] 

372.57 382.27 A: [noise] oh but it it wouldn't cover it here i mean if i was to have to go back to work [noise] and do something like that and work in a department store [noise] there's no way [noise] [mn] 

377.71 379.04 B: mhm 

381.24 383.39 B: right exactly 

382.84 390.64 A: i pay s- [noise] we pay like seven dollars an hour for a babysitter [mn] [noise] and then you need clothes to be able to you know work clothes 

386.92 388.48 B: mhm 

388.61 389.81 B: right 

390.05 392.26 B: right for an office job 

391.82 392.99 A: [laughter] 

392.65 394.60 B: (( yup it wouldn't pay )) 

395.14 402.48 A: [noise] [noise] [mn] you can [mn] my you can hear one of mine just woke up [laughter] my peace and quiet [noise] o- um [mn] [noise]

423.89 436.85 A: so i it's doesn't it doesn't pay for me like as we were discussing like [mn] [noise] i was thinking about going back to work [noise] but it just didn't pay to have somebody at home with them [mn] especially if i was to put them in daycare or a nursery school 

426.60 427.91 B: no 

430.23 431.32 B: uh-huh 

431.51 432.74 B: right 

433.02 434.20 B: right 

436.27 437.63 B: mhm
