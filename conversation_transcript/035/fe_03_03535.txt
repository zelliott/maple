198.74 200.29 B: to do that you know 

199.11 207.00 A: [mn] [sigh] so how does a minimum wage come into that does it produce that kind of uh 

207.63 217.77 A: us and them or or does it uh create such an environment that you know well we're sending a lot of our jobs overseas where they'll do the same job for
