9.18 10.59 B: yeah [laughter] 

10.19 11.54 A: [noise] [noise] well this is 

10.85 12.11 B: (( how you doing today )) 

12.11 17.85 A: oh i'm doing fine actually i was in the car on the way to [laughter] an appointment but i have ten minutes in the car so [laughter] 

17.62 19.61 B: oh okay [laughter] 

18.65 21.17 A: [laughter] [mn] well i guess we're supposed [noise] 

20.07 22.42 B: are you able to drive and talk at the same time 

22.14 24.07 A: oh i have a headset on don't worry 

23.52 24.92 B: okay okay good 

24.89 26.00 A: yeah so 

25.12 26.22 B: want to make sure 

26.23 27.39 B: [mn] okay 

26.26 36.62 A: [mn] and i guess we're supposed to talk about the uh minimum wage that i heard and i i i missed the last little part of it if it's the five fifteen an hour was a fair wage is that question 

28.80 30.74 B: minimum wage yeah 

36.00 38.57 B: [noise] no if it's sufficient [mn] 

38.00 39.59 A: (( [noise] oh if it's suff- oh okay )) 

38.88 45.70 B: do we think it's an ef- sufficient amount i really don't because uh over here it costs two dollars to get on a train so 

45.61 47.32 A: [noise] yeah i've been in new york 

46.57 48.97 B: five fifteen it's not gonna make it [laughter] 

48.77 57.71 A: [mn] [mn] yeah uh i can't imagine five fifteen is even a decent wage for anyone because i make almost four times that and i still have trouble living on that even here in georgia [noise] 

56.93 65.75 B: [noise] exactly so do i so do i and it's hard to even pay rent and get to work and do what you have to do on the money that we make imagine five fifteen 

66.25 67.17 B: (( you know [noise] )) 

67.23 77.16 A: [noise] no and i've and i worked years ago and i'm talking when i was a teenager when it was three thirty five an hour [mn] and thought that was money [mn] but you can't raise a family on five fifteen an hour 

76.18 78.28 B: exactly exactly 

77.24 78.19 A: and that 

78.77 83.82 B: [mn] especially over here because the cost of living is really really high [noise] 

82.38 93.62 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah i think when they raised i mean i think they're doing the right thing by continually raising the minimum wage but the problem with that is you have to look at geographics and where people are i'm a originally from 

92.56 93.75 B: (( exactly right )) 

93.48 98.78 A: i'm originally from louisiana and five fifteen an hour is plenty money but there are many people 

98.56 108.90 A: who can almost barely survive on that well you look at people in the northern parts of the country they can't live on five fifteen an hour [mn] and that there there are other i'll i'll also look at other things 

105.85 106.71 B: (( exactly )) 

108.86 120.34 A: you know if if you're on to- and i've been in the past before i i graduated college on public assistance because [mn] when you made the minimum wage you weren't eligible for anything for anybody to help you [noise] [noise] [mn] [mn] 

119.83 124.46 B: exactly i know exactly what you mean i had a lot of trouble with that when i had my first baby 

124.46 125.25 A: uh-huh 

124.50 127.00 B: and i wasn't able to work after 

127.35 133.08 B: after i did that for a while 'cause i was sick and nobody wanted to help out with uh 

133.05 143.10 B: anything and you know now i'm stuck with a new baby and you know i'm not working and there's still nothing nobody wants to help so [mn] five fifteen is horrible 

143.10 144.35 A: (( [noise] now we the first )) 

144.14 158.56 A: the first question they tell you you quit your job you're eligible for one two three four five six programs [mn] well i prefer the work i prefer not to sit on the settee i prefer to go to work and make money and try to make a home for my family but yet i can make more money 

150.02 151.36 B: (( [noise] right )) 

151.77 152.74 B: (( so do i )) 

158.60 166.29 A: by s- by getting public assistance because there's so many programs there are programs that will pay the rent there are programs that will pay the lights there are programs 

159.46 161.20 B: sitting at home yeah 

165.57 169.51 B: right so it's like encouraging to sit home and have kids 

166.59 168.73 A: that will even give you childcare 

169.30 176.39 A: it's it's encouraging people you can make more an hour on public assistance than you can going to work for five fifteen an hour [noise] 

172.19 173.26 B: right 

175.85 179.12 B: exactly and the more children you have the more money you get 

178.51 188.38 A: the more children that's right so i mean i think we need to look at increasing that maybe increasing the minimum wage and de- decreasing maybe public benefit [noise] a- 

181.11 181.84 B: (( [noise] )) 

186.59 190.52 B: right exactly give people a reason to go to work [noise] 

190.28 202.73 A: yeah give 'em an incentive you know because if it were you can't you have to sell your car well great i'll sell the car i go to work for five fifteen an hour [mn] but i can't pay anything and then i have to go back on public and then i'm in a worse situation than i was before 

197.17 198.46 B: (( [noise] exactly )) 

202.64 211.78 B: exactly and car insurance is sky high so they'll be working you wanna have a car at five fifteen there's no way and then [mn] public transportation is just expensive two dollars each way 

211.60 213.16 A: [noise] yeah we were ju- [noise] 

211.87 213.45 B: so you really can't win [noise] 

213.38 225.41 A: we were in new york in january and i love new york and we go there all the time and [mn] i thought about you know even just us paying on that rail pass like a couple of dollars a day but if i had to pay that every day that's more than i pay here in gas in georgia [noise] [noise] 

223.39 224.53 B: right 

224.88 230.77 B: that takes a chunk out you know at the end of the month [noise] that that's a good a few hundred dollars you spend just getting around 

230.17 232.17 A: just get on the train because i realised 

231.28 232.62 B: exactly 

232.24 234.41 A: you can't get around in the cabs on that money 

234.38 236.37 B: no no no definitely not 

236.14 244.41 A: well i realised that [laughter] when we were there [laughter] and the train came in very handy itself [laughter] it really worked out have you done these surveys before 

237.48 240.09 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

240.35 241.05 B: [noise] 

244.32 249.82 B: [noise] i did it one time before this this is the third time they called me they called me yesterday but i missed the call so 

249.66 253.37 A: oh you know you can call into the computer right and initiate a call 

252.11 255.88 B: yeah i know i think they allow you to do it three times or something like that 

255.26 261.65 A: oh see [mn] i was on a call yesterday on a particular topic and the my phone cut off [noise] 

261.88 272.27 A: just sort of happened the phone cut off and when i called the eight hundred number back she said you'll have to initiate another call so i just waited for the next free cell you can just wait for the next call which is what i did 

262.13 263.67 B: oh 

272.32 273.93 B: oh okay 

273.54 279.47 A: yeah yesterday was a much easier topic than the minimum wage because i have issues with this minimum wage with anything because 

279.90 284.28 A: [mn] [noise] just because i just honestly don't think it's just enough money for people to [mn] [mn] 

280.57 281.13 B: (( [noise] )) 

283.10 291.18 B: right it's just not fair i mean you know if they're going to raise taxes and raise you know the fare to get on public transportation then they should raise minimum wage at the same time 

291.34 295.08 B: just to be fair to the people that don't make enough money 

292.81 293.59 A: (( well you )) 

295.20 298.08 A: well then they also look at okay who's responsible 

298.09 309.09 A: you know when you raise the minimum wage that you talk about the budget that the government has to set who is actually responsible um for paying that i'll say who is going to pay it when you find fi- 

307.43 310.24 B: right what are you going to do with the people that don't make much 

310.17 313.70 A: (( yeah but you find money for everything else in the budget so that they haven't been having )) 

312.91 314.07 B: (( exactly [noise] )) 

313.76 324.17 A: millions of dollars for this put it towards other things you know also education and you know but stop throwing money at public assistance programs because i haven't seen any money for those programs 

323.96 327.33 B: (( oh they definitely not definitely not and you know )) 

326.36 327.03 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

327.69 334.48 B: it's just not fair to the people who you know have to go to work everyday and can't be on public assistance you know 

334.64 335.55 A: (( yeah right [mn] )) 

334.71 340.50 B: is that fair and i i've never been eligible for it you know [mn] living out here 

339.38 340.13 A: (( for [mn] )) 

340.45 341.48 A: oh and 

340.71 347.57 B: i've never been eligible for it no way not even when i didn't work there was an excuse 'cause i 'cause i have a savings account i can't get it 

347.50 348.46 A: really 

347.60 350.46 B: you know yeah you're not allowed to save money 

348.72 357.37 A: oh yes oh oh ye- i but you know what i used to do is take it out because all you have to do is just one month and then you put it back in [laughter] at the other point of the month 

353.58 354.68 B: right 

356.79 358.00 B: [laughter] 

357.98 361.10 A: i'm sorry um i had to do what i have to do i was in school 

358.29 359.56 B: [laughter] 

360.19 369.21 B: well it's true because they don't you know they don't give you any kind of leeway you can't have a savings account you can't have this um but you can't have a job either so it's like wh- what am i supposed to do you know 

367.15 367.86 A: well 

368.72 380.66 A: an- and actually i had a decent job at that time y- you're talking maybe eight nine ten years ago and that was making almost nine dollars an hour and in the middle of the country in louisiana that was decent money you have to realise 

380.57 381.45 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

380.82 388.01 A: back then that was a lot of money and when i try to apply for just even food stamps or anything they say well fine you quit your job 

388.01 402.88 A: i said well i'm making more than minimum wage and i'm still makin- and i still can't survive so would those people who who make half of what i make i don't understand how they live and you know what i mean give up everything so i can go and just stay home 

388.29 389.48 B: right 

393.60 395.02 B: exactly 

395.35 396.47 B: i'm not gonna 

398.90 400.22 B: exactly 

401.53 404.28 B: (( put together a little bit of food stamps right [laughter] )) 

404.10 406.43 A: please i can eat but i can't live exactly 

404.78 407.83 B: it doesn't make any sense it doesn't make any sense 

407.63 410.55 A: i could eat all i want but then what happens to the rest of me yeah 

410.35 411.60 B: [laughter] 

411.84 414.21 B: you'll be homeless but with all the food you can eat 

414.08 424.26 A: right [laughter] i could just that that works out really well i i don't is that is five fifteen the minimum wage now i don't even know what it is or is that something that they're proposing 

414.93 416.45 B: [laughter] 

417.34 418.71 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

422.24 424.01 B: (( okay [noise] )) 

424.66 431.89 B: i don't know over here it's actually five forty so i i'm not sure if in certain states it's five fifteen or they just asking 

428.38 429.13 A: (( if if )) 

432.02 435.99 B: in general five fifteen because over here five forty what's minimum wage over there 

432.20 432.94 A: (( but )) 

435.81 437.92 A: i don't know that's what i h 

437.02 440.00 B: oh you don't know the current minimum wage well it's five forty here 

438.72 439.56 A: no 

439.96 441.77 A: oh it's five forty there 

441.22 444.70 B: yeah not that you know twenty five cents is a big difference but 

444.42 446.29 A: right right right right 

445.91 455.45 B: but it is five forty over here and they just raised uh th- the fare on the trains to two dollars so [noise] i don't know if that had anything to do with it but we have a terrible 

455.89 457.26 B: (( anything so )) 

457.17 458.91 A: oh okay 

458.05 463.02 B: you know really really terrible guy he's a billionaire so he doesn't really care about us 

462.99 463.81 A: uh-huh 

463.21 467.42 B: and he's just like raise this raise that you know he's got all the money in the world so it doesn't matter 

466.89 468.47 A: [noise] right right 

467.86 473.47 B: so you know that five fifteen over here y- people would be outraged completely outraged 

471.85 472.94 A: (( and they'd be outraged )) 

473.07 479.15 A: more though if if five fifteen is the minimum in new york it's five forty and you still can't live on the five forty [mn] 

478.82 486.76 B: exactly exactly and i bet you the cost of living is much cheaper in georgia well you can im- you can imagine here i mean it's really bad here 

483.35 484.38 A: well 

485.92 486.48 A: (( [mn] )) 

486.61 489.77 A: well compared to new york it is you know 

489.02 495.14 B: yeah that's what i'm saying like i know it's probably tough as it is but you know over here it's like the worst place to be 

495.16 506.35 A: [noise] yeah because we get people who move here to georgia from new york and basically you know you get more house for your money you know you could buy two hundred thousand dollar house here but there you get maybe a small brownstone for two hundred thousand dollars tops 

500.68 501.64 B: right 

505.37 513.19 B: exactly exactly i mean for a one bedroom apartment they want a thousand dollars and that's ridiculous i mean you know 

509.88 512.25 A: yeah that's it's about seven it's 

512.74 524.91 A: about seven to nine hundred dollars here on the average for anything decent and i don't know at five fifteen an hour you can't pay that you have to live in substandard housing and you have to do something with your childcare and your gas money so 

520.40 521.58 B: exactly 

524.77 531.53 B: it's true yeah you know it's a thousand dollars for the apartment then you got to pay light and gas and so on and it's like you know screw that that's 

531.66 534.86 B: paying it right there you got to have a house you know 

533.67 537.93 A: yeah there is there is no such thing as getting ahead at five fifteen an hour 

537.82 540.66 B: no there's no way absolutely no way 

540.60 541.64 A: (( no so )) 

540.92 544.41 B: no i i hope they hear you though maybe they'll maybe they'll raise it [laughter] 

544.59 556.10 A: well i don't i i haven't heard any other proposed legislation 'cause the only other president uh other than clinton that came out of office was the only president that i remember that went on ahead and uh 

556.10 566.86 A: moved it from three thirty five and i think they went to four eighty five or something and now it's like five something an hour or so that's the only thing that i remember i haven't heard anybody even discuss it 

559.28 560.43 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

564.81 572.96 B: yeah it's true yes it's true i mean they're more worried about the war and then they're spending all this money on the war 

566.87 568.29 A: with bush and all his 

568.69 569.60 A: (( and then )) 

572.80 585.00 A: well yeah that's what i was getting ready to say um they're talking about the war and i think everything else is just kinda going to the wayside since then although i understand that it is very important but you also have other issues in the world that are going on 

584.83 592.78 B: exactly besides the war they're making the war the center of everything and you know people can't go to work now there's oh actually there's a hiring freeze here 

592.66 593.84 A: (( [noise] oh really [mn] )) 

592.83 599.95 B: so you oh yeah the mayor issued a hiring freeze so i actually took an exam that gives marks for clerical-
