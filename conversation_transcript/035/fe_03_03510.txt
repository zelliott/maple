0.00 1.10 B: hello 

0.59 3.70 A: hello i'm uh larry stewart how are you 

3.23 5.94 B: i'm vince barbalase fine how are you 

5.55 7.58 A: [cough] i'm pretty good 

7.10 14.16 B: [sigh] so the topic was t- the minimum wage being raised to five what was it 

12.83 27.11 A: so well they were asking i believe the question was whether or not it was a uh [sigh] a a a fair amount that the minimum wage uh being at five fifteen an hour [sigh] and uh how we feel uh that it should be raised and probably what would be fair 

18.86 19.71 B: that's 

19.80 21.58 B: mhm 

24.93 26.59 B: [noise] i see 

27.38 39.68 A: [sigh] and uh my opinion certainly is uh [sigh] that uh at five fifteen an hour being the minimum wage is uh [sigh] yeah at state assessment is way below uh uh poverty range [sigh] [mn] 

34.23 34.81 B: (( mhm )) 

38.64 39.21 B: (( [noise] )) 

39.00 45.55 B: [sigh] absolutely i agree the only problem with that is that that raising the [sigh] 

45.48 55.46 B: uh minimum wage has repercussions on people that have store fronts and whatnot and the prices of servicing goods uh [sigh] 

55.77 63.17 B: snowballs uh to the consumer so [sigh] really what you're talking about is buying power isn't it 

62.56 74.04 A: [sigh] well yes we are but if we do assess the fact that it that if they were to raise [sigh] the minimum wage above five fifteen that would put more money to circulate into the economy 

73.99 76.12 B: (( [lipsmack] well i agree but [noise] )) 

74.54 82.11 A: which therefore again you see this all comes back on business so the business would be feeding itself in that nature wouldn't you agree [laughter] 

81.58 83.68 B: uh well er 

83.74 84.52 B: (( the )) 

84.64 90.16 B: [lipsmack] it's a touchy subject uh it's pretty loaded uh [laughter] but um 

89.73 91.84 A: it is controversial no doubt 

90.52 94.86 B: yeah absolutely absolutely but uh i mean 

95.27 96.44 B: i guess 

97.03 109.73 B: [noise] if you look at it the average family household you know nobody i know makes five fifteen an hour [sigh] and [mn] [sigh] there's no way that they could support themselves [sigh] 

109.63 118.20 B: but yet on the other hand you know er [sigh] [noise] what are the repercussions [noise] i mean did it really do that much good when [sigh] the minimum wage was raised 

118.31 124.82 B: um [lipsmack] i think it was back in the sixties right to three from three dollars to five dollars or you know 

123.82 125.56 A: [noise] oh yeah yeah 

124.97 126.36 B: yeah so i mean 

126.51 128.18 B: aren't we just kind of 

128.19 137.19 B: chasing good money after bad i mean wouldn't it wouldn't that [sigh] wouldn't the the the extra funds be more productive 

137.19 146.15 B: in maybe tax cuts [noise] for businesses to hire people uh to maybe generate more jobs to 

144.58 155.30 A: well what you have to look at is this is in our society we have all classes of people we have college educated people we have 

151.59 152.81 B: (( i agree )) 

153.11 155.55 B: mhm 

155.06 160.24 A: [cough] excuse me we have uh uh high school educated people we have people who don't even have that 

158.27 160.02 B: mhm 

160.07 162.39 B: mhm 

160.21 171.13 A: the and these people who don't even have that [sigh] and some who only have the high school education [sigh] are in the poverty level who are forced to work at the minimum wage level okay 

170.59 175.53 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

171.07 184.11 A: uh a lot of these people also uh maybe uh single uh young ladies with children single men with children as i was myself i raised my daughter myself you know uh from the time she was thirteen months old she'll be twenty three 

177.69 179.94 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

180.82 183.10 B: (( mhm )) 

184.10 186.09 A: and what happens 

185.94 196.59 A: well just like uh as you were referring uh back you know when they did raise the minimum wage from [sigh] i think it was like three sixty three sixty five to five dollars 

194.31 197.13 B: something like that yeah 

196.37 203.77 A: that's i mean you know that is a huge help to to someone who's actually just trying to tug and pull for themselves [sigh] 'cause if you get 

202.32 207.08 B: yeah but i mean now we're looking at the same situation that they w- uh 

206.98 217.61 B: are you uh is there a situation that [sigh] it's just raising the uh amount of minimum wage to follow the increase in um 

217.39 229.49 B: [lipsmack] the the increase in the cost of living increase [sigh] or is it to try and help those people that are in that situation i mean i have the [sigh] marketable uh [sigh] 

229.29 233.18 B: career type background with an education 

233.08 244.67 B: so i mean maybe you just kind of answered the question yourself maybe [sigh] that money would be better spent [noise] to be put into [noise] daycare facilities educational facilities uh 

244.73 252.17 B: to broaden the amount of people that are ab- able to get education you know what i'm saying you know what i'm driving at 

250.16 253.18 A: [sigh] well yeah uh i certainly do 

253.22 264.46 A: but there again it all comes back home and and and what i'm i'm talking about is what actually comes into the home now uh uh i will grant you 

264.23 277.82 A: that when it comes to there are already programmes in place for daycare for people who can't afford daycare so that they can go to work you see what i'm saying all right so 

269.56 271.28 B: mhm 

274.18 277.29 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] mhm yep yep )) 

277.72 278.38 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

277.85 282.22 A: either way it goes either either they raise the minimum wage 

282.13 294.56 A: from what it is to something higher get more coming in to the household because then that's going to be more money spent going out into the economy [sigh] whereas if the money stays such as it is 

284.43 286.63 B: (( [sigh] )) 

291.30 293.66 B: (( i [sigh] [noise] )) 

294.35 301.91 A: who's picking up the balance anyway well the state because they are poverty level [sigh] they are eligible for food stamps this and that and what have you 

301.76 304.68 A: you see what i'm saying so ei- either way it goes 

302.70 303.63 B: (( yeah )) 

304.47 316.84 A: [sigh] i mean it's either the people [sigh] have the opportunity to work for it earn it [sigh] uh pay taxes on it and collect at the end of the year [sigh] or they get that much less and then the state has to help them out monthly 

316.61 325.04 A: and and so it's more coming back out of the state [sigh] as where if the wage were higher there would be more taxes being paid in correct 

325.13 337.29 B: i i i agree with you that if there was more people working there would be more dollars circulated through the economy [sigh] and that would drive the whole economy up [sigh] and would probably l- 

337.28 342.31 B: alleviate the need for more people to look for better paying jobs but [sigh] 

342.67 347.92 B: it isn't raising the income ta- the um 

348.28 350.05 B: [lipsmack] minimum wage excuse me 

350.14 355.09 B: uh just a short term type fix it you know what i mean uh 

354.40 361.73 A: well no not actually because when they raise the minimum wage they can't take it back down it isn't short term it's it's a permanent uh move 

361.24 366.87 B: i understand that but the cost of living will be going up and will uh [sigh] 

364.14 365.91 A: absolutely so 

367.24 375.85 B: it will i'm sure will switch paths and i mean uh to five w- what was the what was the proposed raise to uh 

374.79 382.76 A: i believe i i'm not sure it i i think it's like uh it's five fifteen five twenty five an hour now 

381.25 385.07 B: and that's the federal minimum wage yeah 

382.78 392.82 A: yes and i believe it's about to [sigh] the raise is supposed to take it up to like five sixty five fifty five sixty something like that [sigh] but uh 

387.77 389.72 B: mhm 

393.09 405.11 A: a- again what i emphasize on [sigh] is when you look at the poor [sigh] now a l- a lot of businesses i mean look at these multi million dollar businesses such as mcdonalds these restaurants [sigh] 

398.28 400.45 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

404.91 416.29 A: i mean they brag about uh being sold this that and this and that and there are multi million dollar [sigh] uh companies corporations [sigh] multi multi billion dollars [sigh] 

407.31 409.01 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

416.12 420.94 A: who and and the most that they can pay their help is five fifteen an hour 

419.90 422.34 B: (( [noise] well )) 

420.96 423.50 A: i think it's kind of uh hoggish don't you 

423.14 424.42 B: yeah i 

424.60 431.61 B: [sigh] well nobody is going to be s- uh supporting a family not for very long not for long on that wage 

429.48 431.23 A: they're not unless they were 

431.39 441.74 A: absolutely not unless there were two people in the family a married couple and they were both working [sigh] for a minimum wage then they could make it because that doubles it and it it goes from 

432.04 433.16 B: uh-huh 

434.99 436.85 B: (( mhm )) 

438.76 440.55 B: oh and then 

440.71 444.93 B: not very much i know er i i i get your point but [sigh] 

444.90 447.88 B: i i just think that i mean i've 

447.65 462.35 B: i've lived the situation that you're talking about i mean i was a truck driver myself and i'd gotten into an accident [sigh] and i'm not a truck driver and i decided to go back to college myself to try and make myself more marketable [sigh] 

454.19 458.42 A: well you know that's exactly what happened to me that's exactly what happened to me 

462.29 466.23 B: and get a better paying job 

466.40 478.76 B: and i mean it it's not easy and obviously if everybody [sigh] if if college was easy everybody would have a degree and and no it's not 

474.95 486.40 A: well and college isn't for everybody everybody doesn't have the aptitude for it so therefore there's always going to be the rich and there's always going to be the poor there are there are just always are going to be the the poor 

479.45 481.25 B: absolutely 

486.35 496.62 A: i mean we have [sigh] we have the collar people who design everything [sigh] who who draw up all the paperwork who uh [sigh] uh like your engineers and and your architects 

494.08 498.03 B: [noise] yeah you bring up a good point mhm 

496.51 506.10 A: and all like that [sigh] but but who is actually out there putting it all together and doing the work the blue collar fellers who are out there making it happen you see what i'm saying 

501.10 503.12 B: the blue collar 

504.71 509.09 B: mhm you're you're very astute i agree uh-huh 

506.16 507.41 A: these are 

507.93 520.83 A: yah and so these are the people i mean without the poor people without the blue collar the white people may as well stay home because they can sit there with their pencil and draw the plans all they want to but are they going to get off their butt and go lay brick no 

514.30 515.76 B: mhm 

517.61 519.43 B: mhm 

519.84 523.66 B: it's not going to get done you're right mhm 

521.17 523.60 A: right and we can we can uh 

523.41 531.04 A: we can uh uh load trucks all day long but if we don't have drivers to drive them with the c._d._l.s and going to school and got the c._d._l. [sigh] 

528.75 529.87 B: yep 

530.84 541.55 A: uh uh you know to uh be able to haul these things it's going to sit still and the economy goes to hell in a in a hand basket i mean that's just you know [sigh] i mean because like you said you've been there yourself 

540.94 542.78 B: yeah yeah [noise] 

541.63 546.08 A: and uh so it's kind of like one hand washes the other [sigh] but 

544.95 548.20 B: [sigh] but i i just still can't uh [sigh] 

548.22 557.01 B: to raise the income the way to raise the minimum wage er just seems like a circular argument that [sigh] it's not a- i 

557.75 572.53 B: guess there's really no [sigh] fix all you know there's no fix all solution for [noise] anything and you're right there is always going to be uh class conflict between those that have and those that do not have [sigh] but i i just don't see [sigh] 

572.47 579.30 B: raising uh chasing good money after bad [noise] as being the solution i mean there's always 

580.28 581.65 B: i i g- [sigh] 

581.79 587.38 B: i i agree and i'm not saying that [sigh] anybody should have to live off of five fifteen an hour 

586.81 591.91 A: well th- that can't be done i mean we both know that it just it it it can't be done 

588.37 590.03 B: (( well )) 

591.76 595.08 B: but i just think that there there's always a better answer 

594.79 599.89 A: well let's look at it this way okay let's look at it this way the more money
