204.44 214.98 B: they have a lot of money to send people to war but they don't have money you know it's sort of like a lot of homeless people on the trains there's a lot of homeless people in the street 

212.36 213.30 A: yeah 

215.15 216.78 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

215.74 218.69 B: with a place you know nowhere to sleep at night 

218.90 225.89 A: well there's some pe- [noise] some people that think that [noise] we shouldn't even have the minimum wage as high as it is or even have one because [noise] it you know [cough] 

226.41 239.87 A: it can uh i don't know cause it you know there's some jobs where you you shouldn't get paid that much and some jobs where you should be getting paid more and instead everybody's getting the same minimum wage and and you know the people 

236.74 237.76 B: mhm 

239.90 242.86 A: will only pay that because they can get away with [noise] 

242.50 243.79 B: exactly 

243.41 255.42 A: it and if uh maybe if they didn't have a minimum wage they'd have to pay you what you're job is worth and and you know they would only get people for certain jobs if they paid more you know [noise] 

252.81 254.51 B: mhm 

254.75 264.27 B: i think the only like the only like um they should get a lot of money because they have to deal with attitude they have to deal with customers all day 

264.11 274.48 B: everyone eats fast food everyone's coming in there the lines are jam packed they deal with a lot of high volume they should get you know at least seven dollars an hour 

271.51 272.38 A: yeah 

274.53 276.09 A: yeah yeah really 

275.07 278.12 B: not five fifteen that's slaving your way there 

277.85 279.72 A: (( yeah )) 

278.50 292.36 B: that's why i quit at wendy's i worked for one day the next day was my birthday so i really didn't go in and then the next day i was tired from hanging out on my birthday so i didn't go in and then from there i said you know what it's not even worth it 

291.72 293.01 A: yeah 

292.38 295.21 B: and then i had to take a ten dollar cab there 

295.17 296.32 A: oh man 

295.56 302.40 B: then i left from there because it was so late and my mother was worried about the wendy's massacre that they had i think like four years ago 

302.12 303.33 A: oh boy [noise] 

302.62 317.19 B: out here so my mother was worried so i had to take a cab home at night so that's say like sixty dollars coming out of my pocket and when i get a check it's only like a hundred dollars minimum wage but that's really i'm working for forty dollars that's not worth it 

312.25 314.02 A: [laughter] yeah 

316.49 319.84 A: yeah you might as well be on welfare whatever huh [noise] 

319.12 329.81 B: i'm telling you welfare would have gave me more money the welfare would've gave me uh probably a hundred and twenty dollars in cash and maybe a hundred dollars in [noise] money for food [noise] 

329.67 330.51 A: huh 

331.21 333.79 A: and they're they're they're expecting people to work though 

333.92 335.30 B: (( [noise] exactly )) 

335.03 336.41 A: that doesn't make sense 

335.51 336.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

336.81 339.40 B: [noise] i'm like these i don't know 

337.26 337.99 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

339.42 345.12 B: that minimum wage thing and then i had went to macy's and i was p- applying for a job there 

345.73 353.84 B: and they said four seventy five an hour and then after you work i think for a month they um they raise it to five fifteen 

353.70 354.58 A: oh 

354.36 356.67 B: (( i'm like four seventy five )) 

354.71 355.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

356.49 360.66 A: wait a minute that can't be right th- they can't st- start you out on less than the minimum [noise] 

360.48 371.01 B: yes and then it's the um one of my friends is working at pizza hut and the lady started her at four seventy five because the lady said well you're gonna get tips anyway 

371.12 376.28 A: [noise] yeah well i think yeah they they have certain laws places where you get tips they can uh 

376.13 377.39 B: lower it 

376.39 380.69 A: they they can lower it or something which i don't think is right either [noise] 

380.50 385.80 B: that's not right i mean if you do a good job you'll get tips and they should leave it like that 

385.39 390.87 A: yeah [noise] i mean it seems to me a tip is something extra you're getting for doing something extra 

389.27 393.59 B: (( yeah that's you doing for doing good service you're getting a tip )) 

393.01 398.49 A: and if you're doing the minimum job then that's the minimum wage is what you should be getting paid for it 

397.89 399.43 B: (( exactly ))
