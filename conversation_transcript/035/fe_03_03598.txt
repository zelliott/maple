0.72 2.69 B: (( hi this is adrian )) 

2.60 4.63 A: hi this is karen how are you 

4.51 5.62 B: okay 

6.49 9.24 B: and so what do you think about minimum wage 

6.67 7.44 A: well 

9.14 16.26 A: well i think that even an increase to minimum wage right now 'cause that amount is so way below standard 

16.57 17.78 B: i agree 

17.63 24.96 A: i mean basically some that are are trying to live off a minimum wage you're pretty much in the poor 

25.26 26.53 A: category 

27.54 28.93 A: and 'cause i 

27.88 33.26 B: yeah i agree i think it's very very hard i don't even know how people live on it 

32.59 33.85 A: i don't either 

33.43 37.80 B: i i had i had no idea and it it became very 

38.24 49.04 B: clear to me like a couple of weeks ago my nephew who's very young he was thinking about moving to this state that i live in now he lives in the south moving east 

49.12 50.70 B: and um 

50.74 61.41 B: you know so he like works in a book store and so i said well there are a lot of book stores here and well when i found out what they pay i'm like and they pay over minimum wage 

61.15 62.51 A: mhm 

61.89 64.69 B: you know i'm talking about seven dollars an hour 

64.20 65.23 A: right 

64.90 77.43 B: but the take home after taxes the kids were telling me they're only taking home like a hundred and ninety you know i'm like you can't be paying any rent getting a hundred and ninety 

77.23 78.22 A: no 

78.24 84.21 B: it it just it to me it's just totally inconceivable how people live like that 

84.87 93.02 A: well and you know like today with the cost of living i mean the the minimum wage has not kept up with the cost of living 

93.01 96.30 B: no it hasn't and it hasn't kept up with inflation either 

94.27 95.36 A: and 

96.10 105.02 A: no it hasn't kept up with inflation so like you said bringing home a hundred and ninety a month it's or you know every two weeks it's like how could you possibly afford an apartment 

104.32 108.72 B: you can't afford an apartment you can't live l- you can't live anywhere but home 

108.54 109.54 A: right 

108.94 110.96 B: so so most of the kids 

111.00 116.31 B: that that are looking at these are kids that you know they're in college and this is just 

116.43 121.94 B: you know the it's not e- i don't even think they're working full time because it's not a serious thing for them 

121.76 123.00 A: right 

122.07 131.13 B: but you know they have a place to live they have their food you know the food is they get into room and board and you know so it's not like 

131.51 133.89 B: they don't need it to pay any bills 

133.52 136.79 A: right so yeah they look at it as probably being 

135.54 140.01 B: the bills i'm like how do you do it you know 

140.79 144.02 B: and there's a lot of people in my city who don't have health insurance 

140.79 141.69 A: i mean the 

143.84 144.93 A: yeah 

144.20 146.25 B: and there's a lot of 

146.45 158.15 B: places now that are giving health insurance but you have to be making minimum wage to get it i said nobody who makes minimum wage can get this health insurance because they can't pay their rent [laughter] 

158.00 159.26 A: exactly 

159.81 160.66 A: [laughter] 

160.31 166.23 B: it's like it it it's to me it's it's very very it's very very weird 

166.27 173.99 A: well they not only need to raise it to what they're proposing but they need to raise it they need to do a substan- a substantial raise to it 

173.54 175.32 B: a substantial raise 

175.44 177.50 A: i mean it needs to be increased at least 

176.38 180.44 B: but ah saving iraq i think we need to save the united states [laughter] 

180.10 191.41 A: well yeah exactly i mean it's like ye- i agree with you that we spend a lot of money on all these other countries and we have just as many you know poor people out of work people homeless people 

190.94 192.56 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

191.63 199.93 A: you know people that are struggling day to day that if we put a two dollar increase on minimum wage that would bring it up a little bit for people anyway 

194.01 194.90 B: yeah 

200.91 202.33 B: (( i i you know )) 

202.92 206.25 B: (( i just don't get it 'cause i don't think that people can live )) 

207.25 211.71 B: under ten dollars an hour i just don't see how you could live under ten dollars an hour 

208.69 210.07 A: they can't ah 

210.41 214.04 A: no and mostly have two incomes like my sister makes about um 

213.12 214.94 B: (( yeah unless you have two incomes )) 

214.28 227.03 A: right my sister makes like seven fifty an hour and all she does she cleans that night so she can stay home with her daughter- her two ah sons and then her husband makes probably i think he makes twelve fifty an hour 

221.43 222.33 B: mhm 

227.37 236.02 A: and that you know they they live in a a modest live i mean it's not like they take they can't they can't take their or do any of that kind of stuff 'cause it's too expensive 

236.16 238.00 B: it's expensive 

237.38 242.50 A: but there's no way that they would make a the four of them on on seven fifty an hour even 

242.80 244.92 B: no there's no way the 

244.19 246.28 A: they wouldn't be able to make their house payments 

245.37 254.69 B: you know a single person couldn't make it on seven fifty you know and i live in new york and so it's a big urban city and of course the living here is very high 

247.74 248.78 A: no 

254.43 255.93 A: mhm 

255.34 257.04 B: so you know like 

257.52 260.38 B: a one bedroom apartment today 

260.40 262.86 B: is like fourteen hundred dollars 

262.32 263.37 A: wow 

263.36 264.09 B: yeah 

264.67 266.76 B: yeah fourteen hundred a month 

266.96 273.02 B: you know unless you are lucky enough to get into like a rent stabilized situation or 

272.35 273.26 A: uh-huh 

272.92 285.58 B: really super lucky and you got a rent controlled years and years and years ago but if you just went out and you know you worked and stuff like that and you just paid regular rent it's it's it's really 

286.33 295.49 B: you know i mean and all we're doing is setting up more projects 'cause that's the only place where people could afford to live i guess is in the projects if they're making that kind of money 

293.74 294.98 A: right 

295.87 304.71 A: well and and medical i mean there is ah there's no wonder why people tend to stay on welfare longer because they actually get paid more on that 

298.47 299.23 B: (( but uh )) 

304.31 305.21 B: they do 

305.31 306.28 B: they do 

306.55 307.74 B: they do 

307.83 310.15 B: they do in a lot of states 

310.17 317.62 B: it is better our our welfare's changed and here in we've had some changes in our [laughter] welfare in the last few years so 

315.49 321.91 A: right and i know they're trying to make that so it's not like that anymore but that's the that's the way it used to be 

319.30 328.07 B: have to work they're working for less than minimum wage and i don't understand unless they're in the projects where they're living you know [laughter] 

323.09 324.20 A: right 

327.79 328.94 A: i know 

329.11 337.68 B: so like there's no way you could pay it but people people on what do they do and a lot of those people they want to get off they want to get a job 

337.28 338.34 A: i know 

338.35 341.65 B: woman she had she had five kids 

342.07 344.67 B: and she did all of this stuff 

344.62 358.28 B: you know like they sent her to school she got training she went and got her geds she did all of this stuff to get off i think she worked for four months and she was like i've got to go back there's no way i can make it 

357.66 359.64 A: yeah 

358.54 367.21 B: there's no way because when they when they cut them from the welfare they cut them from a lot of other stuff it 

366.55 370.36 A: right they cut 'em from the usually programs that they get for their kids and 

368.87 377.38 B: don't care anymore you know so now she's you know she's okay now i'm going to have to pay my whole salary just so i'm getting baby sitting 

377.04 378.31 A: exactly 

378.04 391.98 B: to go out [laughter] and do to do this and then when she you know after she added it up she said i'm tired i don't have no support i don't have no childcare i don't have medicate anymore covering the medical expenses for me and the kids 

391.51 392.60 A: right 

391.98 396.94 B: and so you know when she added it all up she said i i can't do this anymore 

397.17 405.52 B: and she went back to welfare she said you know i'll just go back and 'cause she was living in the projects she said i'll just go back because 

405.70 415.33 B: you know at least i can get i can have you know healthcare for everybody you know i don't have to pay out all of these things and i think she did transportation 

412.43 413.69 A: (( [noise] right )) 

415.57 424.18 B: and and and childcare i think she only had like she only had twenty five dollars more than what she had when she was on welfare doing nothing 

423.92 425.01 A: (( oh my )) 

424.84 430.13 B: she was like no it don't even it doesn't even add up you know and she said 

430.16 440.72 B: when she first was on welfare before they you know gave her her g._e._d. you know trained her up in the g._e._d. and all of that she wouldn't have been able to add well enough to know that it wasn't 

441.14 444.25 A: yeah [laughter] 

444.10 448.33 B: (( [laughter] and she's like now i'm educated so i know there's no )) 

447.54 448.41 A: (( ah ))

450.49 451.71 A: (( yeah gees )) 

452.98 453.92 B: so 

454.21 455.63 B: it's wild 

456.15 461.01 A: well hopefully us doing these kind of surveys will make america up it's like gees 

461.74 463.77 B: i i i truly hope so 

463.81 467.42 B: because we really have to take a long you know 

467.50 469.44 B: look at our situation 

469.49 474.17 B: and i travel and when i travel you know we talk about france 

474.21 476.60 B: but i have a lot of respect for them 

476.34 477.24 A: uh-huh 

476.99 478.42 B: let me tell you

495.17 496.56 A: i know 

496.36 498.84 B: it's it's built into their system 

499.21 508.81 B: women who have a baby they pay you you don't have to take like family leave and you don't get paid you get paid for a year your salary 

509.38 511.40 B: and you stay home with your baby
