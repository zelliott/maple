2.15 3.04 A: [noise] 

7.81 8.96 B: hello 

8.57 9.59 A: hello 

9.38 10.70 B: oh hi [laughter] 

10.12 14.87 A: hi i didn't know that somebody here was actually there yet [laughter] 

13.09 17.10 B: (( ah i didn't either [laughter] ah well ah my name's natasha )) 

17.12 18.51 A: my name is pam 

18.60 20.47 B: i see you have a baby there 

19.45 25.03 A: [noise] i do he's drinking some milk and that's why i thought it was a good time to sit and talk on the phone [laughter] 

24.59 26.63 B: oh well mine's down for a nap 

26.38 28.55 A: oh lucky you [laughter] 

27.46 32.76 B: [laughter] ah well i guess we're supposed to talk for eight minutes about minimum wage 

32.23 37.21 A: [noise] that's right about the whether we think it's enough 

36.86 39.54 B: right five dollars and fifteen cents 

37.62 38.46 A: (( [laughter] so )) 

40.49 45.22 B: um well ah i don't work currently i just stay home with my son 

45.27 59.53 A: [mn] that's the same way i am [noise] i haven't worked since two thousand when i had my now two and a half year old and now we have a another little one [noise] and i couldn't tell you that i really knew what the minimum wage was 

59.60 62.13 A: until she said it on that little recording 

62.21 63.06 B: well 

62.35 63.14 A: but [noise] 

63.10 68.33 B: i didn't either um about i didn't know how much it was either but ah 

71.24 72.95 B: it's more than it used to be 

72.56 79.94 A: [laughter] it's more than it was when i earned minimum wage but yet i don't know that [noise] i think it's still enough 

80.20 82.07 B: i really don't think so either 

81.68 83.11 A: i think that 

83.68 90.78 A: a lot of times people get caught up in thinking minimum wage is geared strictly toward teenagers and summer jobs when 

90.84 94.32 A: everybody i think loses sight of the fact that there are 

94.56 99.31 A: probably adult wage earners out there relying on minimum wage jobs as well 

99.49 105.78 A: and in those cases i would think five dollars and fifteen cents i can't imagine getting by on that 

105.30 108.02 B: right i don't think i don't think that i would be able to 

108.47 111.49 B: even with with minimum bills because it's 

110.90 112.56 A: exactly 

114.12 115.61 B: it's just 

116.15 118.22 B: how can you survive on that 

117.28 117.86 A: (( [noise] )) 

118.07 121.43 A: i mean you would have to work a hundred hours a week [laughter] 

119.65 120.97 B: (( it's like yeah )) 

122.03 123.96 A: to get anything out of it 

124.11 126.90 B: and that's for that's just that's before taxes 

126.59 127.48 A: right 

127.03 128.58 B: so you're not bringing home 

129.04 130.47 B: that much either 

130.27 131.14 A: no 

131.43 133.15 B: the five fifteen an hour 

132.91 133.84 A: no 

134.20 136.29 A: but even if at that 

136.40 143.98 A: at that point people with children probably do get the more tax benefits from [noise] earned income credits and whatnot but 

144.06 146.98 A: i still don't think it's a high enough rate 

146.51 147.38 B: right 

147.41 149.96 B: but you don't get that until you file your taxes 

148.79 151.17 A: you don't get that um yeah once a year 

150.14 152.23 B: so y- you don't see that every day 

151.66 160.87 A: right and then you're more apt i know if i got a big refund back i'd be more apt to go spend it all at once as opposed to budgeting for the next year 

157.48 158.41 B: (( right right )) 

162.51 166.05 B: you see that that big thing that you've needed for so long or 

165.58 172.30 A: [mn] or the big thing that you really really wanted but couldn't afford [laughter] and all of a sudden you have this money 

167.23 168.68 B: you just wanted [laughter] 

168.77 169.88 B: (( right i )) 

172.76 173.90 A: (( oh )) 

173.41 175.89 B: think i think we do that anyway 

177.71 178.68 B: (( but um )) 

179.32 189.57 B: yeah i just don't see that that the average adult worker can survive on that without government assistance or some other assistance throughout the year 

187.08 187.97 A: that's 

189.17 195.08 A: that's the thing that that was the comment i was going to make a few minutes ago [noise] or a minute ago was that 

194.91 204.49 A: if the minimum wage were higher for the adult worker you might be able to alleviate some of the public assistance programs 

203.11 204.18 B: right 

204.67 206.71 A: (( they'll be earning more on their own [mn] [noise] )) 

206.35 207.67 B: i think so too 

207.79 216.23 B: because um a single mother with even one child who has to work for a minimum wage half of that goes toward daycare 

215.85 217.07 A: exactly 

216.66 221.57 B: so how can she afford to also feed that child and clothe right 

220.14 225.12 A: provide a place to live and [noise] transportation to and from the job 

225.59 234.33 B: right and e- especially if if ah she lives in a state where the the cost of living is is higher 

234.00 235.44 A: (( right [noise] )) 

234.70 237.31 B: because minimum wage is a nation 

237.79 238.93 B: (( standard right right )) 

237.83 246.96 A: exactly minimum wage in idaho might be different than minimum wage in washington d._c. realising what everything else costs 

247.49 249.94 A: i mean even though it's the same amount 

250.18 252.17 A: you can't get as much for your money 

254.22 258.00 A: although having never been to idaho i don't know that for a fact [laughter] [laughter] [noise] 

256.38 257.49 B: well [laughter] 

258.38 261.68 B: ah me either although i i mean um 

262.22 263.65 B: well i've never 

264.58 269.07 B: really had to to live on minimum wage but ah 

269.50 272.24 B: even i i know right out of college i had a 

272.38 273.69 B: a lower 

273.74 275.22 B: pay scale 

275.66 278.18 B: i would not have been able to make it on my own 

277.89 282.52 A: no not especially not with a family i mean you think of 

281.48 282.58 B: (( i had to have no )) 

283.22 291.10 A: on that amount that you earned out of college some people don't even quite earn that liv- you know living on minimum wage 

290.76 294.95 B: i i mean i remember just me i had a hard time 

295.73 299.98 B: and i had to have a room mate to help me so you know it was it was split 

299.34 300.72 A: exactly 

300.65 303.58 B: some somebody who's not married and 

303.29 310.17 A: i think the last time i've earned minimum wage it was down at three dollars [laughter] and some odd cents way back when 

310.70 312.73 A: (( so not that far back [laughter] )) 

313.45 314.11 A: [mn] 

314.30 315.60 B: (( yeah well i i don't )) 

314.39 315.07 A: but 

316.08 326.42 A: i just don't see how people i don't see how you would be able to i can see for a teenager [noise] perhaps five dollars and fifteen cents yeah that's a lot of money to them 

322.47 323.32 B: right 

325.34 327.01 B: that's spending money spending 

326.46 335.37 A: yeah let's just go out and have fun and no worries but somebody who's got to buy groceries and power bills and phone bills and [noise] 

334.50 337.48 B: money car payment and rent and 

335.54 336.74 A: car payment 

337.83 340.07 A: it it would be impossible 

339.99 344.31 B: right and and i do live in a state where the cost of living is not that great 

343.96 345.05 A: oh really 

344.41 346.20 B: and i remember it it being 

346.47 349.41 B: actually still pretty hard to make it 

348.91 356.00 A: hm i think it just all ties together with 

357.48 368.89 A: public assistance and whatnot i think if you raised this if somehow the minimum wage were tiered or something maybe the high school workers could get the lower minimum wage but yet 

369.04 374.49 A: you know a a man with a family and two children that with a higher minimum wage 

374.81 378.95 A: that might work without causing people to have to have 

379.12 381.08 A: assistance from other forms 

382.12 385.66 B: right yeah i i think really if it were based more on 

385.85 389.24 B: the the cost of of actual living 

389.20 390.16 A: right 

391.03 391.90 B: and i 

391.10 396.71 A: and maybe not a nationwide rate it may be varied by region of the country 

393.92 394.82 B: well 

396.78 398.09 B: that could be 

397.50 400.03 A: for the you know by the cost of living 

400.26 402.61 B: and like you said earlier um 

402.95 403.83 B: if the 

404.22 407.35 B: the minimum wage were greater then 

408.40 411.21 B: government assistance could be lessened 

411.37 412.50 A: it could be 

413.64 417.93 A: and probably not wind up costing anybody any more money [laughter] 

416.35 420.37 B: i was going to say [laughter] it would probably end up with the tax payers 

420.52 423.67 B: (( having less burden in the long run that's true )) 

422.22 423.54 A: probably so 

423.56 437.29 A: but then to look at it from the other point if the minimum wage were increased that would cause businesses to have a greater expense also in their from the wage itself and from their their portion of the taxes 

439.38 441.16 A: but 

441.42 443.63 A: i don't own a business either [laughter] 

444.44 445.40 B: (( yeah well neither do i )) 

447.68 450.32 B: i'm just a just a mommy and i 

449.72 452.71 A: that's exactly where i am these days 

453.06 458.31 A: just a mommy maybe one day i might be out there earning money again but for right now no 

459.45 463.32 B: [laughter] i can say that i'm glad my husband earns more than minimum wage 

462.28 464.37 A: [laughter] me too [laughter] 

463.56 467.23 B: else i would not be a mommy i would be a part time mommy right 

464.73 466.04 A: [laughter] 

466.72 469.32 A: well that's that's a good point 

469.73 477.00 A: if the minimum wage were higher even in a family where that's their source of income perhaps 

477.31 483.25 A: the mom couldn't would be able to stay home with the children more instead of having children in 

483.26 487.68 A: daycare systems twelve hours a day because both parents are having to work 

488.30 494.87 A: and maybe the moms could afford to take a part time job as opposed to just a in a full time job minimum wage [mn] 

496.87 498.05 A: and it would be 

498.27 501.44 A: in my opinion ultimately better for those children 

501.58 502.79 B: i think so too 

504.19 509.08 B: i think so too m- well i mean to stay home we took a significant 

509.12 510.32 B: cut 

511.01 512.26 B: you know i mean 

512.35 514.94 A: well true you lose an entire income 

515.71 520.33 A: even though some of the expenses of working go away also but 

519.93 521.29 B: they're replaced 

521.09 527.32 A: they're replaced with trips to walmart and and a mommy i want that candy bar and [laughter] 

521.38 522.81 B: [laughter] 

523.48 524.72 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

528.45 535.45 A: and all sorts of other things diapers and [laughter] foods greater foods 

536.20 538.14 A: i don't see how people make it 

538.54 539.67 B: i don't either 

539.65 548.00 A: i mean it but like you said earlier too looking back on what you made in you know right out of college can you imagine raising a family on that 

548.51 550.22 A: it wouldn't wouldn't work 

551.55 552.97 B: (( no i've )) 

554.18 557.62 A: they say that people spend what they have but 

557.80 563.30 A: to some extent you have to have a certain amount otherwise you just don't make it 

560.63 561.59 B: right 

564.21 565.36 B: that's true 

566.30 571.33 B: and anytime that you have a little more money if you're not at a point 

572.38 573.40 B: in your 

573.61 577.99 B: lifestyle that you want to be or you can comfortably live 

578.23 579.16 B: then 

579.77 581.27 B: you will spend more 

580.96 582.04 A: that's right 

581.41 583.29 B: everytime you get it 

583.90 586.17 A: and wind up getting in trouble and 

586.31 587.23 A: then 

587.60 590.60 A: having to get out of it which can cause 

591.72 597.28 A: the people public in general a lot of expense from people filing bankruptcies or whatever 

599.18 599.89 B: (( right ))
