0.44 1.76 B: hello 

1.74 15.00 A: hi um i'm calling concerning um this subject of minimum wage and [mn] i wanted to talk to you um and a little bit about how i feel about minimum wage which is currently five dollars and twenty five cents an hour 

6.78 7.83 B: right 

14.60 16.07 B: (( [noise] right [noise] [noise] )) 

15.02 25.93 A: and [mn] my feeling is it's uh not sufficient today because with all of the cost of living um increases that we constantly have prices are going up on everything 

25.28 26.66 B: (( [noise] [noise] that's right )) 

25.94 32.65 A: and it's at such a greater rate than uh minimum wage going up [mn] so people are are 

32.77 39.16 A: really even if they get a raise it doesn't count for the fact that everything else costs so much more [mn] 

38.34 39.93 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] i agree with you )) 

39.54 41.78 A: you do and um 

40.20 41.24 B: yes [noise] 

42.39 49.64 A: [mn] uh i i feel it's it's very hard and especially people that work for minimum wage don't always get benefits 

49.27 52.48 B: [noise] no they don't and especially when they're part time also 

50.01 51.18 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

52.34 55.25 A: that's right and when they're part time and that's that's very 

54.19 59.54 B: when they're part when they're part time they don't get anything [noise] they don't get benefits at all 

55.78 56.59 A: mhm 

57.00 58.57 A: that's right 

59.17 60.37 A: yeah 

59.57 63.32 B: [mn] and minimum wage on a part time job pays nothing 

62.89 65.07 A: it d- it does it pays nothing 

64.21 68.64 B: [noise] by the time the taxes come out and everything it's really bad 

66.20 67.25 A: (( yes [noise] )) 

68.00 81.15 A: it is [mn] and then there's people who are are really struggling they're losing jobs they have families to support it's not like [mn] you know maybe y- maybe a uh fifteen or sixteen year old kid who wants to go out and make a few bucks to spend 

69.72 70.30 B: (( [noise] )) 

79.48 82.56 B: [noise] [noise] that's it to buy new clothes [noise] 

81.65 85.23 A: right exactly you know nevermind a roof over their head [noise] [noise] 

83.48 96.75 B: [noise] these are family pe- these are men who [mn] or women who have who've had jobs in the past and have nothing else to take [mn] for maybe an illness or something might have occurred and they couldn't work 

90.84 91.66 A: yeah 

94.91 95.97 A: yeah 

96.29 98.69 A: that's right that's exactly right 

97.07 104.47 B: [mn] [noise] and now they have to go back to work and start over and it it's terrible to start 'em off at five something an hour [mn] [noise] 

100.34 101.30 A: yeah 

103.34 111.83 A: that's right that's right i i believe that too and i i don't know what it's gonna take to make that change um my feel- 

110.70 118.11 B: [noise] well i guess it might be just to mm [mn] a lot of angry people who get paid five [laughter] something an hour 

112.06 112.88 A: (( mm )) 

117.74 119.78 A: that's right that's true 

119.19 122.45 B: you know to lobby up at the cou- at the white house [noise] 

119.90 120.66 A: yeah 

121.81 126.20 A: that's the th- well that's the thing that's the thing i think we have to do and it always depends 

126.70 128.49 A: who's in administration 

128.49 140.32 A: like i've i've noticed that you know now that we we've been through a war and they're still in war all these funds are taken [mn] from again [mn] a lot of people who are relying on minimum wage or tiny increases from there 

140.30 145.76 A: and um and then you know we're the very ones who get cut from any kind of 

144.11 153.77 B: [mn] but if you notice though every time there is a war [mn] it seems even though they t- say that the economy is bad it seems like [mn] it's the opposite 

152.73 156.93 A: [noise] mhm [noise] well that's true that's true if you very very often yes 

154.40 162.59 B: you know [mn] because like like people are i live in florida and people are buying houses 'cause my husband is a builder a framer 

158.22 159.26 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

162.23 163.28 A: okay 

162.86 165.02 B: and they're [laughter] always working 

164.82 169.97 A: yeah yeah yeah that's true but i wonder if that's true for the the minimum wager 

165.48 166.93 B: [mn] you know i mean 

169.51 175.24 B: [mn] well no the minimum wager is different because they're like you know they're like considered 

170.65 171.51 A: you know 

172.24 173.69 A: it is different 

175.20 189.38 B: um unskilled and and [mn] just you know [mn] but see the basic problem with the minimum wage [mn] idea is is that it was originated um for high school kids you know 

177.42 178.39 A: yeah 

178.59 179.66 A: (( not bright [noise] )) 

187.49 190.69 A: [noise] [mn] mhm that's right and that's fine 

189.52 201.11 B: and that's the majority of it that was you know that based based their income on that was just a kid they wanted it for a new car new clothes [mn] to go out at night or something [mn] 

193.28 194.06 A: yeah 

194.80 195.88 A: right 

197.16 198.06 A: mhm 

198.34 199.30 A: sure 

199.75 202.33 A: that's right that's right [mn] and that's 

201.20 204.36 B: to buy their things that they need and see they 

204.34 219.21 B: took those jobs and they turned them into jobs for kids so that they can pay the minimum wage [mn] but then when you have an adult that needs a job that's willing to work for minimum wage [mn] they take them but then they have to l- 

209.64 211.11 A: mhm right right 

214.82 215.76 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

219.06 223.79 B: you know be like the kids but they don't have any responsibility the kids 

223.03 227.53 A: mhm that's true [mn] and you know what yeah they do exactly 

223.87 225.88 B: [mn] the adults do [mn] 

227.33 234.07 A: and also um a lot of a lot of you know kids that are able to work by kids i mean you know again like sixteen and older or whatever 

232.55 233.90 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

233.84 246.99 A: [mn] um they take jobs cutting grass shoveling snow babysitting [mn] um and you know they don't although technically they're supposed to pay taxes on that they don't and then you have the honest you know the honest person who's out there working for their 

237.56 238.92 B: (( right [noise] )) 

242.46 244.00 B: no they don't [noise] 

246.83 261.80 A: [mn] you know five twenty five an hour and then the little increases that come after that from time to time [mn] and um also like you said the part time worker [mn] i you know if they're not gonna get benefits i think [noise] that they should they should get compensation instead 

255.18 256.22 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

260.46 266.34 B: [noise] [mn] well see the problem is is that when they work part time the insurance is so expensive to cover them 

265.77 267.52 A: oh it is it [mn] 

266.51 277.82 B: [noise] it's a lot more it's a lot much more cheaper to go ahead and uh pay somebody fulltime [mn] but the companies don't do that because they can pay 

268.84 270.34 A: than they even make 

273.62 274.87 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

275.65 279.31 A: that's right well at least give them fulltime benefits 

278.69 280.45 B: right m- [mn] because 

279.35 281.31 A: i mean that's that's how i feel 

280.73 286.69 B: right they can't because what happens is is that [mn] they can hire two part time people 

286.28 287.49 A: mhm 

286.87 293.45 B: and pay them minimum wage each instead of paying one fulltime person and pay 'em twelve dollars an hour 

288.65 290.75 A: that's right and no benefit 

291.52 292.30 A: yeah 

293.09 295.46 A: that's right that's right 

293.87 300.57 B: see [mn] so that's what they do you know and [mn] it's just really terrible wh- what state are you living in 

296.02 298.40 A: mhm yeah and 

300.07 302.43 A: [noise] i'm in um philadelphia 

302.05 303.81 B: oh you're in pennsylvania [noise] [noise] 

303.26 310.72 A: i'm in pennsylvania yeah and um it's hard here especially m- you know medical medical costs are so high 

310.00 312.02 B: well it's real high here too 

311.58 318.21 A: well yeah florida is too you're right i think that we're in states we're both in states where it's like some of the highest in the country 

316.99 318.99 B: [noise] yeah [mn] 

318.31 326.34 A: [mn] and then um you've got [mn] actually down in florida well there's a lot of um retirement people in pennsylvania and florida in fact those 

325.30 335.03 B: and that's another thing that that makes me irritated is because the retired people [mn] or most of them that had retired from jobs from years and years ago 

326.59 328.00 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

334.52 335.67 A: mhm 

334.92 344.95 B: get a nice income and everything [mn] and people like i'm on a disability i- um i'm on social security disability that's money i worked for since i was sixteen 

336.98 338.10 A: right 

339.77 340.92 A: okay 

344.57 347.36 A: wow mhm 

345.33 349.89 B: but you know it's like d- if i had to live alone on that it's not enough [noise] 

349.45 350.81 A: no it's not 

350.34 363.56 B: and just because [mn] you know i didn't retire [mn] uh from a big rich job that was my money that they took out every week you know at sixteen years old i was having taxes taken out of my check 

355.78 356.54 A: right 

358.42 360.71 A: absolutely yes 

362.58 364.54 A: sure sure 

363.50 369.33 B: [mn] and then i have to turn around and like grapple for it you know and that's my money [mn] 

366.83 368.08 A: that's right 

368.58 375.84 A: yeah and even with disability i think that in some cases you can even work like part time it's like a certain number of hours a month 

373.05 374.55 B: [noise] yeah 

374.87 378.93 B: yeah but then if you go over they take it back plus it 

376.28 387.05 A: but i know and also if you're gonna work part time [mn] you know you you wanna work part time for like ten dollars an hour [mn] or something rather than have to work two hours for one 

386.70 388.32 B: [noise] that's right i mean 

387.24 392.19 A: you know especially when you're disabled i mean if you think of people that are handicapped disabled mhm 

390.95 395.98 B: well i have a breathing disease which i can't work i work like at home on the computer 

395.57 397.85 A: oh th- that's good okay 

396.72 401.84 B: you know but like i do like mystery shopping and stuff and that's not really an income you know 

399.68 400.70 A: great 

401.02 402.73 A: (( [mn] right it's [mn] )) 

401.92 408.54 B: to base it on [mn] but it just helps out with a little couple of extra dollars and stuff [mn] but you know if i had to 

406.20 410.06 A: that's right and i'm sure it pays more than five twenty five an hour 

409.62 410.59 B: pardon 

410.16 413.80 A: and i'm sure it pays more than five twenty five an hour that's the other thing 

411.66 412.22 B: (( [mn] )) 

412.15 424.91 B: yeah but yeah because it's like it's based on per job instead of per hour [mn] but i couldn't go to work like [noise] for five dollars and twenty five cents an hour and stand up for eight hours at mcdonalds or something 

416.00 417.38 A: that's right 

417.50 418.69 A: that's right 

424.42 425.63 A: (( oh i know )) 

424.72 428.74 B: [noise] i couldn't do it it would kill me i'd be in the hospital [mn]
