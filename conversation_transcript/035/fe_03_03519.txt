18.43 19.70 B: yeah me too 

20.01 24.71 A: um i just nowadays i just don't think that five fifteen is enough 

24.81 29.59 A: [mn] especially for like single parents um trying to raise kids 

27.55 28.17 B: yeah 

29.93 32.78 B: yeah single parents with kids are you know

35.35 36.89 A: no it's not 

36.85 39.25 B: just let alone get along [noise] 

39.36 41.79 A: i think they should raise it to um 

41.98 43.93 A: probably at least six [mn] 

44.36 45.62 A: six fifty 

44.59 45.78 B: yeah 

45.96 47.34 B: mhm

48.96 50.14 B: yeah 

48.96 53.14 A: [laughter] we can't expect 'em to um jump it too high too quick 

53.42 56.23 B: [noise] yeah six fifty's good 

57.48 61.18 A: um i haven't um worked at minimum wage in 

62.09 65.00 A: years just because i refuse to 

65.45 66.67 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

66.36 73.44 A: i think my time and money is my time and effort's worth more than five dollars [laughter] an hour 

73.65 74.83 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

75.71 78.51 B: (( [noise] i sure [noise] )) 

78.96 85.40 B: they should raise it to um the least amount that people can live on 'cause of bills and stuff nowadays that's not a 

85.42 86.31 A: yeah 

85.42 86.43 B: good amount 

86.92 87.93 B: (( mhm )) 

89.10 94.71 A: [mn] i know we we are finding it hard to live off of twice that much 

94.47 95.74 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

95.53 97.31 A: you know if you've only got one 

98.44 100.77 A: one person working in the house 

101.24 102.83 A: i just don't see how 

101.47 102.50 B: yeah 

102.91 105.67 A: single parents make it when it's all they can 

106.34 107.76 A: make per hour 

108.80 112.37 B: yeah and then the jobs that they do are basically um 

112.52 119.53 B: just [noise] well retail jobs where they're working hard and then for getting paid that much [noise] still no- 

118.61 119.48 A: yeah 

120.68 124.69 A: [mn] i think even a lot of the fast foods are paying more than that 

124.57 129.66 B: [noise] mhm [noise] depends on like where i know a fast food place pays out like ten dollars an hour 

129.24 130.15 A: yeah 

130.04 131.21 B: yeah so 

130.24 132.50 A: i've seen um i 

132.52 135.33 A: the company called bojangles they um 

135.51 139.20 A: i've seen them starting out at like nine and ten 

139.38 144.74 B: mhm yeah in and out burger also pays like ten dollars an hour to start off so 

144.83 148.26 A: [mn] someone called my husband the other day and offered him 

148.52 152.11 A: a roofing position at minimum wage 

152.18 153.38 B: [noise] oh wow 

152.27 155.66 A: and that's like extremely hard work for 

156.60 158.76 A: for no more than what that is 

158.47 167.94 B: [noise] yeah they should just at least raise it to a a reasonable amount that people can at least [noise] be able to live off of 

167.85 168.71 A: yeah 

168.55 170.90 B: (( it's pretty low six seventy five )) 

176.34 180.26 A: [mn] um is it is the five fifteen is that 

180.41 181.91 A: nationwide 

182.55 188.72 B: um i'm not sure 'cause where i live it's six seventy five actually but that's still pretty low 

189.84 191.19 A: and where are you at 

189.91 190.74 B: so 

191.15 192.84 B: i live in california 

192.65 193.45 A: (( oh )) 

193.65 194.74 B: yeah so it's 

193.68 195.74 A: yeah well it's five fifteen here 

196.01 199.95 A: [mn] i don't know if that's nationwide or if it varies from state to state or 

196.05 197.30 B: mhm 

199.88 205.69 B: [noise] i think i think it must vary by state to state 'cause in california it's like six seventy five 

205.92 206.69 A: (( mhm )) 

207.23 208.25 B: (( an hour )) 

209.94 213.27 A: [mn] actually i was thinking it was five twenty five 

213.49 215.74 A: but she said it was five fifteen 

216.15 217.37 B: (( [noise] mm [noise] )) 

217.51 224.30 B: yeah all depends on where the job is most retail jobs are like six seventy five six fifty an hour 

225.51 228.85 A: [mn] i think [mn] personally i think they should um 

229.31 233.09 A: [mn] they should base a minimum wage on the occupation 

233.10 234.96 B: yes i agree 

234.24 237.74 A: i think that would be a good idea i mean if you're 

239.07 245.45 A: doing something that's really really easy and or like a in home type thing 

245.41 246.30 B: mhm 

245.81 248.01 A: where you're like making hair bows or [laughter] something 

248.02 249.76 B: [laughter] mhm yeah 

248.43 257.22 A: um five fifteen wouldn't be that bad um but like for instance the roofing job i mean that should have a higher minimum 

257.50 258.09 B: (( [noise] )) 

257.80 259.60 A: i think it should be based on 

259.93 262.26 A: on the extremity of the 

262.41 263.56 A: the job 

263.76 274.99 B: [noise] yeah like you said occu- um the occupation like um [noise] roofing of course should be just because and plus because um roofing jobs are usually like seasonal 

274.99 282.84 B: so that they don't work that much so when they do work they should be able to at least make enough money to feed their families and pay bills you know 

280.93 281.83 A: (( right right )) 

283.04 284.29 B: yeah 

283.66 287.27 A: [mn] they didn't say nothing about the minimum wage for um 

287.77 292.65 A: waitresses but i think that's real real i mean they're getting cheated 

292.20 296.89 B: [noise] [mn] [noise] [noise] yeah that's one of the lowest because they make most of their money by tips i think 

295.96 302.31 A: right if they're lucky enough to get tips i've seen people not not leave tips 

297.83 298.52 B: yeah 

298.59 300.01 B: yeah so 

302.32 305.55 B: mhm i think that's like the lowest 

306.48 307.16 B: (( um )) 

307.43 309.55 B: (( at least waitress staff yeah )) 

309.36 314.64 A: [mn] i think i think raising raising the minimum the minimum wage would um 

315.02 317.35 A: definitely increase [noise] 

317.42 318.77 A: our economy 

318.80 320.51 B: yeah mhm 

320.04 322.26 A: yes it would be harder on 

322.34 335.70 A: the businesses maybe in the beginning [mn] um but once things you know people were if people's making money then they're going to spend money [mn] if they're spending money then the companies can be making money and [mn] it's just one big circle [noise] 

330.63 331.81 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

336.38 348.10 B: yeah and more pur- more people will be willing to work if [mn] they give a a decent amount a lot of people don't wanna go for work for that little bit amount 'cause they know they're not gonna be getting paid anything so 

346.33 347.21 A: right 

347.70 350.36 A: if it if it was raised it would um 

348.22 348.87 B: (( yeah )) 

350.73 354.06 A: increase your dependability in your workers 

352.79 354.03 B: yeah 

354.66 355.74 B: yeah 

355.90 366.66 A: 'cause i know if i made five dollars an hour [mn] and had to get up at four o'clock in the morning i wouldn't [laughter] want to [laughter] that wouldn't be very encouraging but if i was making seven 

356.02 356.94 B: (( and more pe- )) 

362.60 363.77 B: yeah 

366.71 372.32 A: [mn] you know that or eight you know i would be more willing to crawl out of the bed in the morning 

372.19 376.08 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] i menat something that that you know is worth it )) 

376.19 377.48 B: [noise] exactly 

378.38 382.13 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

381.14 384.03 A: i i definitely think that would that would um 

384.17 386.83 A: that's something they ought to think about 

386.94 388.02 B: yeah 

387.06 389.05 A: when you know trying to rebuild 

389.37 391.06 A: the nation's economy 

391.24 392.32 B: yeah 

391.47 393.11 A: i think they should um 

394.21 395.52 A: start there 

395.79 397.15 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

396.66 401.49 A: and stop some of the other things that was put into order several years ago 

401.80 402.94 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

404.74 408.62 B: (( [noise] yeah they raise they reckon the economy would beind much better [noise] )) 

408.51 411.70 A: yeah i do too 'cause people would have more money to 

411.94 412.93 A: um 

412.98 414.34 A: to spend 

414.20 417.60 B: yeah more people [noise] would be willing to work so [mn] [noise] 

418.17 421.28 B: and people would got get a lot of people off unemployment too 

426.38 429.21 A: [lipsmack] so do you um are you working 

429.76 430.82 A: do you make 

429.79 433.37 B: no i'm un- [noise] i'm unemployed right now 

433.01 434.04 A: (( oh okay )) 

433.95 435.08 B: yeah 

434.85 437.44 A: [mn] i was laid off in 

437.73 438.81 A: um 

440.07 444.96 A: then i had a baby so now i'm just staying at home [mn] i'm [mn] 

443.20 444.27 B: mhm 

445.91 453.22 A: the fact of making five fifteen an hour is kinda what makes me stay at home 'cause at five fifteen an hour i can't afford to pay a babysitter you 

450.26 451.60 B: yeah 

453.20 455.45 B: (( oh yeah mhm mhm )) 

454.59 455.38 A: (( know )) 

455.98 463.74 A: it's not worth [mn] putting him in daycare paying you know ninety dollars a week and then [mn] only making 

463.98 467.15 A: [laughter] a few dollars more than that for working full time 

467.19 468.35 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

467.43 470.78 A: it's just not worth it it's not worth it i'd rather stay home with him 

470.86 471.84 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

472.74 478.27 B: yeah [noise] the more half of your money would be going to daycare 'cause daycare is very expensive so 

477.29 478.44 A: (( oh i know it )) 

478.46 481.31 B: the money that you would be making it's not even 

480.28 485.83 A: and see that's that that area right there is the ones that are making the minimum wage 

485.72 486.68 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

486.32 489.27 A: is is your childcare providers 

489.46 494.81 A: [mn] you know these people charge ya a hundred dollars a week and then they pay their employees five fifteen 

494.82 495.82 B: mhm 

495.12 497.78 A: and expect to get quality service out of them 

498.01 499.17 B: yeah 

498.53 507.17 A: and that's where the um child abuse and neglect and stuff like that comes in because they're not making enough money to care about their job [noise] 

507.16 509.03 B: yup exactly 

509.09 511.13 B: (( [noise] mm it's how people do ))
