4.41 6.00 A: i'm fine how are you doing 

5.80 7.09 B: good 

6.86 13.43 A: um you know i thought that that the minimum wage has been five fifteen for a while is that is that not true 

13.46 16.33 B: yeah yeah um 

16.94 22.95 B: actually uh i thought it went up a little bit higher than that but apparently not 

23.33 24.67 A: oh okay 

24.14 26.06 B: (( yeah s- well uh )) 

24.93 30.57 A: i 'cause i just got the impression from the the way they introduced the topic that it had just risen but i 

30.32 31.76 B: yeah 

32.29 38.95 B: well personally i'll tell you uh i don't think anybody could really survive on that i don't know 

37.70 40.45 A: not at all um i'd would agree with you completely 

40.41 43.02 B: [lipsmack] yeah i mean uh 

44.12 47.55 B: [noise] it it's just totally ridiculous 

47.58 49.68 B: um it's it's 

50.04 58.72 B: i mean there's no way anybody could actually live adequately with to get proper- yeah to get proper housing or you know 

53.76 55.10 A: sure much less 

55.16 56.26 A: much less any 

58.49 61.34 A: mhm or utilities or food or 

60.22 62.82 B: yeah exactly 

61.59 62.51 A: uh 

62.70 65.57 A: any uh you know any any of life's bills 

65.51 66.14 B: [sigh] 

66.05 66.80 A: uh 

66.16 78.98 B: i would l- i would like to know what kind of criteria that they use to actually come to this conclusion to establish that as a standard uh because obviously uh there are er certain inequities [noise] in our 

79.17 85.82 B: system that really needs correcting [noise] and uh that's actually one of them in a [laughter] major way 

85.91 88.16 A: oh definitely i don't i don't think it's ever 

88.70 91.66 A: uh really been adequate and um 

91.22 92.68 B: yeah 

92.54 93.57 A: you know i i 

93.61 95.31 A: you know i have to say i'm i'm very you 

95.34 98.70 A: know i feel very lucky that i d- i don't think i've ever you know worked a 

98.75 107.14 A: a minimum wage job you know my first job out of college was barely more than that um and and it was a it was a tremendous struggle uh 

103.37 104.25 B: right 

106.52 108.16 B: right right 

107.54 111.29 A: so i can't imagine how how you know people with families or 

111.58 115.64 A: you know with uh with any e- essent- well i guess essentially it depends on 

115.67 119.90 A: um on what part of the country you live in i i live in new york and i can't imagine 

118.14 120.94 B: mhm [noise] oh me too 

120.79 122.97 A: oh okay [sigh] um 

121.60 122.64 B: yeah 

123.44 125.20 A: you know it's just not uh 

126.24 130.78 A: it it it seems like it seems like uh most people would it would make more sense to 

131.06 132.95 A: uh you know just stay on the welfare roll mhm 

132.87 136.82 B: yeah in fact it seems like it so it's 

136.95 144.54 B: yeah i mean that's the predicament that it leads people to towards i mean because people that i know who naturally make 

144.53 153.59 B: uh you know a relatively small income where they it it's a struggle relatively speaking i mean they're forced to 

153.74 168.50 B: um enter into a rec- er relationships where it's economically feasible you know like uh [lipsmack] apartment sharers things like that short- sort you know 'cause it makes it more economically feasible for them to 

162.67 163.54 A: right 

168.59 172.01 B: you know have proper housing and to really uh 

172.15 178.29 B: be able to meet their uh day- uh day to day living expenses and all that stuff you know what i mean 

177.83 187.47 A: mhm have you ever read the book um nickeled and dimed by barbara ehrenreich um she's a she's a like a very progressive writer and she um 

181.27 182.39 B: no i haven't [noise] 

187.48 188.90 A: uh i think spent 

189.29 193.02 A: [lipsmack] uh it's either three months or six months um 

193.11 194.07 A: uh 

194.10 199.18 A: working nothing but minimum wage jobs she lived in in sh- she moved around the country a few times 

198.91 199.92 B: right 

199.21 205.81 A: um and took jobs working she took a job in walmart um mostly she worked either as a maid or as a waitress 

205.62 206.51 B: right

209.29 210.87 A: you know of of her

218.89 222.72 B: [noise] and it's it's nickels nickels and dimes by 

221.79 224.36 A: n- uh nickel nickeled and dimed

225.20 226.54 B: and what's her name 

226.17 231.52 A: barbara ehrenreich i believe it's spelled e. h. r. e. n. 

232.15 234.00 A: r. e. i. c. h. 

235.16 236.00 B: (( oh )) 

236.02 250.57 A: [lipsmack] um and basically she was in awe of [laughter] of like these you know of of of the of the people around her who were able to make a living like this you know at the end of her ex- you know uh at the end of her quote and quote experiment she could go back to her 

248.90 249.83 B: right 

250.57 254.01 A: you know to her house and her cars um 

254.02 257.35 A: you know what she found was that in in you know in every case 

257.39 270.97 A: i think she she allotted herself like a couple of uh amenities you know she she brought her laptop computer with her so she could you know write the keep writing the book um and she brought a car with her but she didn't 

266.46 267.39 B: right 

270.99 279.47 A: you know she was she was working from the assumption that she didn't have enough money for example for a you know for like first month you know first month month's rent on an apartment 

279.23 280.41 B: mhm 

279.75 283.30 A: so she could never get an apartment she was always living out living out of 

283.39 294.36 A: these really creepy scary little motels you know or um you know in a couple of cases like befriending you know fellow waitresses and and sleeping on their couches or that kind of thing 

286.03 287.11 B: mhm 

294.22 304.80 B: right right wow that's incredible i'll definitely look into that [noise] um i i know like new york is one example uh 

304.86 309.65 B: i mean in certain parts of the city where communities are economically des- [noise] depressed 

309.49 310.43 A: mhm 

310.08 316.18 B: and you have [noise] like teenagers that get into drug sales 

316.35 320.14 B: uh because it's like quick and it's fast it's lucrative 

320.01 320.92 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

320.33 322.74 B: (( you know and uh )) 

322.96 327.19 B: [noise] it's it's incredible i mean just to compensate for [noise] the 

327.27 339.53 B: uh the deficiency [noise] in the uh low income wage it's just [noise] i just i just find it so uh [noise] what's the word i'm looking for it it's [noise] it's 

339.73 343.83 B: so unrealistic um and it and it's and it's 

344.02 348.27 B: i i just don't understand it doesn't make any sense at all [noise] 

348.41 351.41 B: whatsoever [noise] and it definitely [noise] requires 

351.47 359.29 B: full attention and change [noise] uh among [noise] many other types of inequities [noise] that i recognize in the system do you know what i mean 

358.56 359.88 A: mhm mhm 

359.74 361.01 B: yeah 

360.41 361.44 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

361.24 361.88 B: [noise] 

361.64 363.50 A: yeah i mean i i um 

363.75 368.00 A: [lipsmack] uh yeah these days i'm i'm running my own business uh and i 

367.34 368.36 B: (( you are [noise] )) 

368.14 369.74 A: mhm um 

368.87 371.31 B: great what do you what what kind of business is it 

370.73 372.73 A: i run a computer school 

372.83 374.09 B: oh nice 

373.36 376.16 A: it's mostly f- it's mostly for kids um 

376.24 386.12 A: so i can't [noise] you know i i can't yet um you know afford uh you know full time help you know i hire instructors from time you know from time to time 

384.16 385.27 B: right 

386.27 392.98 A: you know and i can i can pay them something like twenty dollars an hour [noise] but i'm only hiring them for like you know two hours a week or something like that 

392.53 394.57 B: right right right right 

393.00 393.78 A: uh 

393.86 403.65 A: so i think it you know so i i try to so i'm always reading you know websites or entrepreneurs and things like that and and uh you know we er uh seeing what a struggle it is for some 

399.49 400.43 B: sure 

403.76 404.75 A: uh 

405.92 410.00 A: you know i mean i would i would just be in the position where i just wouldn't you know i wouldn't be able to hire anyone 

409.99 410.91 B: mhm 

410.07 412.74 A: you know for a long time you know until uh [noise] 

413.34 414.28 A: uh 

415.04 418.28 A: you know until the business is able to support it but even then 

418.41 420.32 A: you know i can't i can't imagine 

420.57 421.55 A: uh 

421.76 425.43 A: you know i i just can't imagine the businesses that that um [lipsmack] 

426.32 430.12 A: and just the rationale for p- for for paying for just paying minimum wage 

429.93 433.38 B: yeah i think it's like a catch twenty two 

433.50 435.61 B: in the system because 

437.38 439.49 B: in the uh 

439.60 441.56 B: corporate world [noise] 

441.76 445.20 B: you know there uh there has to be um 

445.86 453.21 B: [noise] there there has to be certain inequities like this in order to justify the existence of a welfare [noise] system 

453.30 456.38 B: you know what i mean it sounds ludicrous 

456.68 458.32 B: uh but 

457.76 463.03 A: um why don't you tell me more about what i'm i'm not sure if i'm understanding er uh understanding you fully 

461.13 464.64 B: yeah in another in another words in another words 

464.77 470.30 B: [lipsmack] uh people that are like that are making minimum wage 

470.47 480.48 B: [lipsmack] who have families that they have to support they're forced to go on welfare they have no choice there's really no alternative um 

476.02 477.64 A: mhm mhm 

478.60 479.44 A: right 

480.86 484.67 B: you know they sh- uh you might have one 

484.68 486.32 B: one of the uh 

486.42 489.44 B: [noise] uh spouses who will try to work 

489.72 499.76 B: two jobs while the other has to make him or herself available to be you know to be pick the kids up and be there for the kids and all that stuff so 

497.98 498.84 A: mhm 

499.74 513.68 B: it's really really tough so in a situation like that uh they they seem forced to circumstantially to seek out welfare services you know to get uh food stamps 

513.75 528.71 B: uh to supplement their uh in- low wage income and health care benefits because the low wage income that they're receiving yeah they get no right they get no sort of benefits or healthcare whatsoever 

521.63 524.96 A: [noise] if they can if they can get healthcare if they can get healthcare benefits 

528.72 536.01 B: uh so and you know and as a family it's uh healthcare coverage is really important i mean because 

534.98 535.78 A: (( sure )) 

535.96 544.83 B: the uh the the health of a nation is determined by the health of each individual citizen 

544.80 556.04 B: you know so um to speak of america in terms of a really great and prosperous nation it must be reflected in the lives of its individual citizen 

556.25 557.12 B: (( and if )) 

556.84 560.07 A: true and the quality of life of the of its least fortunate 

557.16 557.98 B: (( uh )) 

558.54 567.66 B: yes right right uh so because each individual uh naturally of course is part and parcel of the greater whole 

567.66 577.23 B: so naturally uh in order for uh the the country as a nation to really uh 

577.24 588.37 B: be revered as very prosperous uh in many ways uh its citizens really need to have that quality of life to uh to be reflective of that 

588.37 592.32 B: so you know it just seems like um 

592.46 597.51 B: the inequities uh it's sort of like a catch twenty two one 

597.52 599.89 B: one uh supports 

597.85 598.63 A: (( [noise] ))
