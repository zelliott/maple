0.00 0.33 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

0.37 1.26 A: hello 

1.05 3.74 B: oh hello i'm rocky 

2.68 3.56 A: hello 

4.26 5.47 A: i'm sam [noise] 

5.19 8.06 B: ahah oh same name as my brother 

7.82 9.61 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

9.35 12.52 B: (( [laughter] )) 

10.09 15.63 A: [noise] [noise] the uh i guess the topic's minimum wage or something huh the uh 

14.51 23.93 B: [cough] yep do you think the minimum wage er uh raised to five dollars and fifteen cents is uh appropriate or not [lipsmack] 

23.11 24.79 A: what what was it before 

26.00 32.87 B: um i think it was five bucks but i'm not sure [sigh] oddly enough [laughter] i haven't kept up with that not in many years 

28.74 30.01 A: oh was it 

30.12 30.99 A: (( [noise] )) 

31.62 32.69 A: (( neither have i )) 

33.92 38.23 A: i think uh actually it should be a little more with the prices of gas and everything nowadays 

39.06 44.05 A: [noise] particularly uh well i don't know but you know it's kind of hard to say you know depending on the job too 

44.09 48.49 B: [cough] [lipsmack] yep uh for me it depends on the job and it depends upon the person 

48.74 58.32 B: um if we raised the minimum wage too high then uh high schoolers in particular are trying to get their first job uh it makes it more difficult for them 

58.15 59.79 A: (( [noise] yeah that's true )) 

59.19 62.22 B: 'cause you know their employer has to pay them the minimum wage 

63.81 71.50 B: that kind of thing so uh it it's a real balancing act and i don't it should be across the board at all 

68.39 69.88 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

73.29 74.96 A: (( i think it's probably uh )) 

75.16 84.28 A: kind of the job i guess too you know depends on the ed- the uh amount of education needed to do the job [noise] 

82.29 93.04 B: yeah i i would tend to disagree with that uh perhaps the technical capabilities needed for the job sure but education is no indication of whether you can do a job 

89.51 90.54 A: yeah 

94.08 96.26 A: well that's what that's what i mean like uh 

97.02 103.61 A: like you know not just education like high school you know just a high school degree whatever i'm just tal- i'm talking like uh 

103.99 111.76 A: you know possibly like uh some edu- like trade or whatever you know like a trade like taking some like a trade school or something 

109.24 110.36 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

111.45 113.20 B: yeah 

113.29 115.88 B: yeah i would tend to agree with that 

116.18 116.84 B: (( hm )) 

119.50 120.85 B: (( [laughter] [cough] hm )) 

120.36 124.33 A: [noise] i haven't i haven't looked at a minimum wage in a long [laughter] time 

124.20 132.77 B: yeah neither have i uh which is uh kind of odd [laughter] because i'm self employed and uh also do odd jobs 

132.80 136.37 B: for various places and so [laughter] 

133.10 134.04 A: (( oh do you )) 

136.56 138.24 A: where ya where ya at 

136.66 138.80 B: years ago i did pardon 

138.63 141.65 A: where are you where do you live at like what city 

140.84 142.80 B: i'm in madison wisconsin 

142.66 146.68 A: oh oh okay that's not too far from me now i'm in chicago illinois 

146.46 147.81 B: oh okay 

149.70 153.67 B: is there a lot of uh jobs that just pay minimum wage down there 

153.95 157.41 A: [noise] i couldn't begin to tell you 'cause i haven't uh 

156.29 157.47 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

157.71 168.00 A: i'd assume like you know like uh burger king mcdonalds and stuff like that i'd assume they start uh start you out on minimum wage you know like shops and stuff 

168.37 173.29 B: yeah i presume [laughter] and i wouldn't know either it's it's kind of odd hm [cough] 

172.71 173.32 A: (( [noise] )) 

174.15 185.89 B: and of course as being self employed i can charge anything i want and minimum wage has nothing to do with it but uh sometimes doubly taxed i have to charge more than uh 

186.26 187.26 B: someone 

187.61 191.18 B: uh basically i have to get a higher wage than someone who is just employed 

191.74 195.35 A: yeah 'cause you have to pay uh overhead and stuff like that 

192.59 193.49 B: so 

195.18 200.47 B: yep yep all kinds of stuff and so i basically have to charge ten dollars an hour or more 

201.25 205.77 B: [cough] so that's my minimum wage [laughter] so to speak [laughter] 

203.16 205.84 A: oh okay [laughter] [laughter] 

206.07 207.68 B: [laughter] 

207.95 209.23 B: uh oh goodness 

209.37 213.85 A: i work for uh sears doing uh heating and air conditioning 

214.39 216.21 B: [lipsmack] uh repair or install 

216.12 217.70 A: repair repair 

216.79 218.37 B: huh okay 

218.54 219.87 A: so that's uh 

220.13 226.31 A: i don't know duh what i make i make about sixteen seventy one it seems like hard to uh 

226.49 234.71 A: you know ma- it might be just the area of chicago you know everything being so expensive but i i couldn't imagine making five fifteen an hour that'd 

231.37 232.17 B: uh-huh 

234.99 238.04 A: you know maybe you could but like i said the area uh 

238.14 240.59 A: taxes being so expensive and stuff 

240.58 254.14 A: but uh i don't know how people even you know at high school i could see you know 'cause parents pay you know they pay to help them out or whatever but just you know a older person without uh any education you know 

240.90 242.29 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

254.10 263.55 A: pass high school without any further education i don't see how they could make it making five fifteen but you know that that's pers- someone's personal you know 

264.03 272.73 A: it's personal pro- you know i don't want to say problem but you know if not furthering your education nor either in a trade or you know a collage or whatever 

273.08 276.67 B: yeah that too or uh making their own job 

276.92 278.18 A: [noise] yeah exactly 

277.34 280.47 B: (( or something like that starting your own company or whatever )) 

278.39 280.23 A: yeah like starting your own business 

280.54 284.47 B: lots of people who have basically no education uh have 

284.50 287.53 B: created their own companies and made plenty of money [cough] [cough] [lipsmack] 

286.96 289.84 A: oh yeah oh yeah that's for sure 

290.53 291.48 B: uh 

292.98 299.38 B: [lipsmack] um and yeah i would tend to agree with you that uh the minimum wage as it stands is well below the poverty line 

299.99 308.35 B: uh even back a number of years many years ago when i was getting minimum wage i noticed that it was definitely below poverty line 

300.17 301.98 A: oh yeah 

309.75 310.90 B: (( so ha )) 

312.22 315.12 B: i it's it's a bad situation 

312.64 314.16 A: (( bad )) 

315.03 318.94 A: bad it is but then again you know if they raised minimum wage then 

319.19 325.85 A: they're gonna raise prices you know what i'm saying and everything's gonna start inflating so it's kind of hard to [noise] 

322.19 323.25 B: yeah 

324.95 331.32 B: yeah it raises the costs of the company and they have to raise the prices that's right it's uh a nasty little loop there [noise] [noise] 

331.01 332.77 A: (( yep )) 

333.09 338.81 A: once they raise that they're going to have to raise everyone else's salary and everything else goes up in the air [laughter] 

339.45 341.01 B: [lipsmack] yep that too 

341.15 342.71 B: bad stuff [laughter] 

342.93 345.60 A: it's kind of hard to say you know what 

346.19 347.30 A: but you know 

349.72 356.53 A: but most i can say is if you don't want a minimum wage go get some kind of you know start your own business you know or you know 

356.74 359.25 A: get some trade or something like that you know 

358.69 367.16 B: yeah get some training or something like this uh [noise] most people can do that unfortunately of course uh some of that requires money to do 

363.75 365.33 A: (( what )) 

367.18 373.23 A: yeah that's true yeah what kind of trade do you do like what uh 

375.12 379.63 B: well i'm a computer generalist myself so i do computer stuff [laughter] 

377.70 378.80 A: (( oh okay )) 

379.70 380.95 A: oh okay 

381.37 386.44 B: yeah and i also do other things uh i'm a general handy man and stuff like that 

388.88 390.32 A: see that's more of a 

390.69 395.23 A: trade you know that's why [noise] it's a it that's considered a trade ain't it or like a 

396.36 399.19 A: or is that won't that be considered 

398.50 403.57 B: yeah well i guess it's considered a trade um [laughter] 

404.17 407.52 B: i'm much more general than the usual tradesman 

407.67 412.85 B: uh because you know there are usually computer technicians for instance which uh they fix the hardware 

413.06 414.49 A: (( ooh )) 

413.22 416.49 B: and they don't do much in the way of software but i do both 

416.76 417.78 B: (( so )) 

416.89 418.75 A: (( i see what you're saying )) 

418.38 424.55 B: so i'm kind of a super tradesman i guess [laughter] so yeah they could call me a tradesman i [sigh] suppose 

423.52 425.40 A: (( [laughter] )) 

424.70 425.80 B: (( hm hm )) 

425.58 426.76 A: (( [noise] [noise] ))

435.63 437.03 A: one of my good friends 

437.61 441.77 A: which is uh i think just north of you ain't it or 'bout a couple of hours north of ya 

441.25 442.80 B: yeah a couple hours north 

443.21 451.18 A: and he uh he went to after high school you know he didn't get in really any trades or you know furthered his education or anything 

451.24 452.50 A: (( and uh )) 

452.74 456.71 A: he he even had a hard time finding a job for minimum wage 

456.56 457.40 B: huh 

457.55 458.68 A: (( and uh )) 

458.91 464.94 A: my other buddy who lives in you know chicago here did the same thing but he didn't even finish high school

470.25 472.31 A: (( i don't know how he makes it [laughter] ))

476.59 478.48 B: yeah 

478.78 480.84 B: uh it's un- unfortunate but true 

483.08 483.99 B: (( um )) 

484.26 487.51 B: although i tend to suspect that anybody who uh 

487.87 488.90 B: really 

489.34 493.35 B: uh really actually wants to get ahead can do so 

493.75 496.87 B: you just have to find the way to do it 

496.25 498.05 A: exactly 

498.77 499.33 B: (( [cough] )) 

500.46 502.57 B: (( uh [laughter] )) 

502.51 503.10 A: (( [noise] ))

550.76 554.70 A: (( [noise] it's kind of a kind of a shock [noise] 'cause i'm like wow )) 

551.02 552.12 B: huh 

553.21 554.30 B: yeah
