16.80 18.76 A: yeah so uh 

18.86 20.96 A: [mn] we're supposed to talk about uh 

21.00 26.47 A: the the line between [lipsmack] acceptable humor and and too raunchy is that 

25.56 30.48 B: [sigh] i [sigh] acc- well it's bad taste in some or another and 

26.57 28.49 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

29.79 31.40 A: [laughter] 

30.77 36.24 B: god knows being married sometimes it goes either way on that line [laughter] 

35.89 36.78 A: (( oh )) 

36.80 40.18 A: [mn] yes uh i think it it certainly depends a lot on the audience 

39.96 41.28 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

40.45 41.60 A: (( [lipsmack] uh )) 

41.62 42.77 A: and uh [sigh] 

42.79 44.08 A: (( uh [mn] )) 

44.33 54.53 A: uh i don't know what [sigh] general rules one can make about it [sigh] uh uh i guess it [lipsmack] it may also depend on the [mn] 

54.61 59.11 A: uh well it's not only the [sigh] the gender of the audience but the age of the audience [lipsmack] 

58.78 61.77 B: oh yeah you know the gender the age uh 

61.07 63.46 A: uh uh a lot of different things yeah [mn] 

62.53 68.60 B: yeah uh the circumstances you know there are there are things that you'd say in a bar that you're not going to say at a dinner party 

67.96 72.29 A: yeah i uh [mn] that's true uh as well mhm mhm 

72.42 73.55 A: (( [lipsmack] uh-huh [sigh] )) 

74.57 79.25 A: (( and uh [sigh] i don't know the this isn't a isn't a subject that um )) 

80.14 84.08 A: uh inspires me to talk a lot on it [laughter] 

82.06 84.60 B: (( yeah i know it it's kinda weird )) 

84.61 85.90 B: um 

86.44 88.60 B: [sigh] and and you know you we can only 

89.27 96.71 B: we can only talk about it from our perspective like i [sigh] i i'm sure women are different when they're in a group than 

93.16 93.81 A: mhm 

97.12 101.66 B: [sigh] uh than w- men would be uh primarily uh [mn] 

97.14 97.70 A: (( [mn] )) 

100.99 102.76 A: (( [sigh] yeah yeah )) 

103.10 104.10 A: (( [mn] uh )) 

103.21 106.39 B: you know in as far as the line uh [sigh] 

106.47 114.62 B: uh that line moves uh you know that line between in good taste and in poor taste [laughter] that line moves back and forth at [sigh] and um 

114.73 115.67 A: mhm 

115.03 117.60 B: i don't think there's any way to to to 

117.72 120.61 B: [mn] to just to say that it's hard and fast i don't know 

120.30 123.03 A: no [sigh] i don't and um 

123.73 125.92 A: [mn] a line about acceptable speech 

125.99 126.55 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

126.80 133.00 A: um separate from comedy but just acceptable speech [sigh] um has swung back and forth in the last um 

133.17 136.98 A: [lipsmack] what uh twenty years i mean 'cause i remember 

135.09 136.25 B: mhm 

137.61 144.48 A: oh i think twenty years ago um [lipsmack] there was a lot more uh vulgar speech just in 

144.53 146.84 A: the ordinary course of things [lipsmack] 

146.91 152.68 A: uh and um [lipsmack] then that um mercifully faded away 

152.77 154.62 B: [laughter] 

153.76 159.92 A: and we save the [lipsmack] [sigh] the really strong vulgarities for when we really need them 

159.85 162.04 B: [laughter] 

160.22 169.98 A: [laughter] [sigh] i always thought it um [sigh] uh depreciated the currency [lipsmack] uh [sigh] to waste some of those choice monosyllables 

170.02 171.09 A: on um 

171.18 175.06 A: [lipsmack] on something trivial you don't get the uh 

172.45 173.62 B: yeah 

175.29 177.79 A: satisfaction out of it [laughter] 

176.92 189.38 B: [sigh] but you know like when it comes to uh to comedy i'm not sure that that same thing holds true [lipsmack] uh just hearing uh you know any of the younger guys uh that i would work around uh 

187.66 188.76 A: yeah 

189.86 193.28 B: [lipsmack] you know they say things that i would have really thought 

193.32 202.05 B: two three four times about when i was their age and [sigh] probably would have passed unless we were at a barroom setting and and and that sort of thing uh 

199.39 200.36 A: uh-huh 

201.72 211.08 A: oh well that's interesting maybe uh [sigh] maybe it's just 'cause i've um [sigh] now working in uh for a different company [lipsmack] that they 

203.39 205.04 B: yeah 

210.81 214.07 B: are you working with an older group of uh folk 

212.36 213.79 A: (( um )) 

213.82 214.87 A: no 

214.58 218.47 B: no okay because i i've got a bunch of young folks and uh 

215.25 216.21 A: (( no they )) 

219.98 224.19 B: [sigh] yeah sometimes i feel like i'm the den mother but yeah in in 

223.36 225.07 A: [laughter] 

225.32 233.14 B: and so in the the comedy as well as the language i don't think has uh has improved at all it's like like you know what you're saying you know 

231.61 232.74 A: (( [lipsmack] really )) 

233.09 233.98 A: huh 

233.34 243.47 B: um and i think primarily it's uh their frustration over the fact that they haven't the vocabulary and they cannot communicate [sigh] uh whether it be comedy or or just normal speech or whatever 

239.72 240.51 A: oh 

243.94 247.93 A: uh uh they [sigh] uh what's the level of education of these people 

244.00 244.84 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

247.85 252.86 B: [lipsmack] college [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

250.01 251.08 A: (( that so [sigh] )) 

252.40 254.08 A: okay [laughter] 

253.02 267.26 B: [sigh] i get them in their last year or so of college and by that point you know [laughter] you sort of hope they have a grasp of uh [sigh] uh of what is acceptable and you hope they have a grasp of the language and uh 

258.61 259.49 A: oh 

266.17 267.93 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

267.61 273.53 B: but i i'm not not finding that to be the case uh at least fifty percent of the time no 

268.05 268.97 A: (( oh well )) 

272.93 277.35 A: yeah huh well that's sort of [sigh] uh discouraging 

277.23 278.22 B: yeah 

277.62 278.70 A: and uh 

278.97 284.28 A: [sigh] [mn] it sounds a bit [cough] um makes work not quite so enjoyable 

280.43 281.48 B: [laughter] 

283.67 289.29 B: yeah but we ought to get back to the comedy thing even when they are trying to be funny 

284.44 285.56 A: (( [sigh] huh )) 

289.26 290.49 A: mhm 

289.87 290.98 B: um 

292.14 294.34 B: they miss it they g- they they 

295.52 299.24 B: maybe it's a generational thing that's you know 

297.37 298.53 A: (( [sigh] [mn] yeah )) 

299.54 304.81 B: that's the other thing uh uh humor only would would cross the line in one generation and not in another 

304.43 308.64 A: yeah yeah that that um th- that's definitely true 'cause um [lipsmack] 

308.90 309.89 A: (( uh )) 

310.78 312.01 A: (( [sigh] uh )) 

312.13 313.35 A: there were certainly 

313.87 318.62 A: uh well it's sort of what i was saying earlier i guess [sigh] things that um [cough] 

318.77 322.88 A: uh i would have said to my contemporaries that i wouldn't say to my parents in law 

322.97 324.05 A: [laughter] 

323.44 326.89 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

326.17 329.05 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] you know but um )) 

329.16 331.64 A: uh i i just don't think one can um 

332.10 333.19 A: (( [mn] uh )) 

333.32 334.43 A: make uh 

335.70 340.50 A: any kind of [sigh] general rule about what's over the boundary [lipsmack] 

340.68 341.48 A: (( um )) 

343.72 344.46 A: (( uh uh )) 

345.12 348.38 B: [sigh] well years ago it might have been easier because um 

350.42 360.76 B: [sigh] the society was probably more strict in what it would accept [sigh] and what it would not [sigh] accept in in behavior in language in 

356.42 358.29 A: (( and um )) 

360.35 362.00 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

361.28 371.53 B: [sigh] uh in everything [sigh] and since in the last thirty years we've seen them throwing caution to the wind and stood the society on its head um [laughter] 

371.49 372.41 A: yeah 

371.66 374.52 B: it gets harder to say where the line is 

373.96 375.16 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

374.58 375.75 B: (( oh )) 

375.87 378.13 A: yeah yeah 

376.50 379.62 B: and everything seems to be so um 

379.68 382.33 B: so relative i guess they say you know [sigh] 

383.52 385.13 A: (( mhm )) 

385.20 397.03 B: uh it's not bad if it's not as bad as the worst one you can find [laughter] so i guess the the humor doesn't cross the line as long as there's somebody around who says something raunchy or something worse you know [laughter] 

385.39 386.28 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

388.90 389.96 A: (( [mn] [laughter] yeah well [sigh] )) 

394.05 395.81 A: (( um yeah i i )) 

396.48 397.53 A: (( don't know )) 

397.88 400.84 A: (( i [cough] um [lipsmack] i )) 

402.00 405.55 A: i'm interested that you uh find that the 

405.71 408.40 A: the people that uh that you work with are these 

410.06 411.97 A: [mn] they're just out of college 

412.13 415.09 B: [lipsmack] uh no they're still in they're in their last year generally 

413.48 414.21 A: still 

414.52 423.08 A: still in college oh yeah okay [sigh] i don't have to dealt with any of [sigh] that kind lately but i have guys who have 

415.39 416.29 B: mhm 

423.21 426.51 A: not long out of college [lipsmack] um 

424.98 429.55 B: yeah we hope once they confer their degree it's uh [laughter] 

428.58 431.93 A: well that's not going to do anything magic overnight [laughter] 

430.33 441.64 B: [laughter] well we sort of hope it does [laughter] i guess i send on them on their way [laughter] and and hope for the best [laughter] i've done the best i can do [laughter] 

433.20 434.47 A: well [laughter] 

441.65 445.71 A: oh the [cough] uh are you a teacher a professor 

445.42 446.62 B: uh yes i

447.64 451.19 B: yeah i i uh well i'm a funeral director and i teach clinical embalming 

451.27 453.76 A: oh well that's a little bit different 

451.89 453.08 B: (( and um )) 

453.49 457.31 B: yeah [sigh] so i get these kids their last year in in uh [sigh] 

457.40 458.33 A: mhm 

457.57 459.09 B: college and 

459.90 465.53 B: [sigh] as they say by that point they're uh [sigh] [laughter] they're different 

459.95 460.94 A: (( yeah )) 

464.99 466.27 A: (( yeah )) 

466.44 471.44 A: [sigh] what was i just hearing something on the about uh what was it now um 

472.49 474.31 A: it had to do with um [sigh] 

475.26 480.24 A: uh cadavers and how they're treated in medical school that was it 

480.36 481.53 A: and uh 

481.99 483.29 A: uh 

483.43 484.43 A: that there's a 

484.87 487.16 A: a a certain amount of um 

488.41 489.60 A: um 

490.12 494.29 A: somewhat macabre levity on the subject 

494.13 496.15 B: (( yes oh god [laughter] )) 

495.73 503.16 A: but i mean actually this person was saying that uh [sigh] that that there isn't much of that that they uh 

502.60 504.29 B: yeah there shouldn't be 

503.44 507.10 A: uh but they they uh treat [lipsmack] 

507.19 508.41 A: the bodies 

508.68 513.36 A: uh with some respect even [mn] in their words about them 

512.82 518.83 B: oh absolutely they better [sigh] uh and i'm the same way uh with my students that there's a 

513.75 514.56 A: yeah 

514.67 515.49 A: yeah 

518.99 528.55 B: uh [sigh] there's time and a place for everything and comedy does not belong in the you know in the embalming room and [sigh] and and and that person uh 

525.21 526.16 A: yeah 

528.62 534.41 B: [sigh] who has passed away is not it and it is mrs jones or mr smith 

533.91 535.72 A: yeah 

534.44 543.67 B: it is not a cadaver it is not a body it is mr jones and [sigh] it is not going to be for viewing she or he will have a visitation 

538.36 539.36 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

543.79 549.02 B: [sigh] uh and yes you know this is a [mn] what you drill into these kids [sigh] um 

548.86 552.89 A: [sigh] well that's very interesting um case about um 

553.11 558.63 A: what kind of humor is appropriate and what isn't a rather specialized environment 

555.73 556.84 B: yeah 

558.21 564.30 B: uh yeah [laughter] [sigh] but uh [sigh] you know what the the humor doesn't revolve around the job 

559.12 560.46 A: (( you know [mn] )) 

565.67 566.56 A: oh 

566.76 574.28 B: the the humor does not revolve around it is [sigh] um the stories they tell 

573.74 574.53 A: oh 

574.34 577.37 B: um the jokes they tell 

574.58 575.39 A: mhm 

577.72 579.21 B: um 

577.82 578.80 A: mhm 

578.87 580.51 A: mhm 

580.58 583.34 B: the because i think they [mn] 

583.41 588.20 B: would um i would hope have the good common sense a this stage of the game that there is 

588.29 598.79 B: nothing humorous about what we're doing [laughter] you know [sigh] um and as i said um i don't know of any instructor who would uh [sigh] who would tolerate uh 

590.51 591.51 A: yeah 

598.77 599.89 A: (( [mn] yeah ))
