20.07 21.00 A: yeah 

23.00 24.40 A: (( comedy huh )) 

24.16 25.51 B: comedy and 

24.42 28.10 A: oh i don't know a lot about comedy i don't [sigh] 

26.22 27.28 B: you do 

27.62 28.99 B: oh you don't [sigh] 

28.38 36.26 A: no except for the comedy i look at but you know i mean [sigh] i don't know how to characterize what kind of comedy that i'm into you know what i'm saying [sigh] 

35.89 43.63 B: well i think they wanted to know how you felt like where you would draw the line between [sigh] what's funny and what's really bad taste 

43.02 46.94 A: (( bad taste okay s- all right i think )) 

45.29 50.76 B: [cough] to me that's if it's offen- if it offends somebody [sigh] it can't be good taste [sigh] 

47.46 48.54 A: yeah 

50.34 52.00 A: okay if it's what 

51.39 58.81 B: if it offends someone if there's a [sigh] a section of the population that's offended by whatever you're saying [sigh] then the humor has gone 

52.57 54.24 A: okay okay right 

55.19 56.18 A: right 

56.83 57.80 A: (( yeah )) 

58.78 69.31 A: oh okay um y- okay i i i i kinda i disagree to the extent it all depends on [sigh] i think what 

59.83 60.94 B: i think 

69.52 79.78 A: you but you're right you know it sometimes stuff that they say about certain people in the population is kinda [sigh] distasteful um [sigh] certain race jokes i don't find [sigh] 

79.80 85.86 A: uh funny unless things like unless it comes from a person who i- who is of that ethnic background 

85.23 87.57 B: i understand yeah mhm 

85.73 94.86 A: you know what i'm saying there's things like you know it's not as offensive [sigh] but just say people in general like when you start talking about stuff like uh [sigh] 

94.84 100.88 A: uh sometimes hygiene i think is kind of distasteful um and uh [lipsmack] 

97.91 99.17 B: mhm 

101.39 102.97 A: what um [sigh] 

103.02 107.75 A: i don't know what do you think about like when the people talk about fat people do you think that's kinda 

107.10 108.54 B: i think uh 

108.69 116.66 B: fat people are usually very sensitive to their weight [sigh] and while they might laugh at the joke [sigh] it's really 

111.83 113.24 A: (( to that yeah )) 

115.19 117.62 A: yeah especially if it's coming from a fat person 

117.42 118.45 B: pardon me 

118.15 120.34 A: especially if it's coming from a fat person mhm 

119.74 125.07 B: right i it they may laugh [sigh] but you don't know what you're doing to them inside [sigh] 

121.23 124.60 A: (( mm )) 

124.93 135.54 B: you know sometimes i think you're [sigh] sometimes when people laugh at jokes that are about themselves you you're almost like killing a little part of them that's their of their spirit or something that's inside 

135.07 141.07 A: i think this of it i think i i i think they're just different i think sometimes laughing about [sigh] 

141.18 145.74 A: uh a a real situation helps to 

145.81 159.61 A: [sigh] bring a uh a realization to that person 'cause some people can be in denial about their [sigh] maybe their habits or [sigh] or their over being overweight [sigh] and sometimes it can it motivates them to to change 

155.43 157.23 B: no yeah you could be right 

159.27 161.84 B: you could be right you could be right 

161.45 162.52 A: you know 

162.08 163.14 B: mhm 

162.96 166.02 A: in some just in certain instances um 

166.46 171.14 A: uh get you know 'cause i think that's what a lot of comedians try to do when they [sigh] 

171.14 178.25 A: when uh they say they say going to to comedy shows is actually therapy that's exac- that's something that i've heard before you know 

177.42 178.42 B: uh-huh 

178.20 191.35 A: uh just to be able to [sigh] to sit and laugh it out now i'll tell you i'm going to [laughter] i'm not going to lie if i was sitting in the front row [laughter] and a comedian started talking about me and my date or just me [laughter] i would be embarassed 

190.92 192.93 B: i'm guessing you would be 

191.27 200.70 A: you know if if i would be totally embarassed i mean [sigh] i i i'd probably laugh it off but at the same time i'd be like man i'd like to smack you right now 

194.21 194.94 B: (( [cough] )) 

200.11 201.33 B: [laughter] 

200.91 202.61 A: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

201.90 214.97 B: i do i do you know i teach school [sigh] and i the school that i teach at the children are primarily polish many of them are immigrants [sigh] and when they get the polish jokes they don't laugh at all 

202.87 204.05 A: yeah 

204.84 205.96 A: okay 

209.73 211.07 A: oh okay 

214.69 216.88 A: oh is that right yeah yeah 

215.49 221.00 B: they find it highly offensive especially when it's about their intelligence 

217.95 219.09 A: okay 

220.60 230.78 A: exactly okay i don't blame them i mean because those jokes are just specifically talking about their their their people you know what i'm saying and 

228.20 229.24 B: right 

229.72 244.27 B: [sigh] exactly and and many of them have their parents really escaped poland when it was under communist rule [sigh] and uh they would love to go back but they can't afford to like the the the cost of living there is so [sigh] uh 

230.99 232.07 A: you know 

234.44 235.51 A: (( ah )) 

236.28 237.33 A: wow 

239.06 240.41 A: oh 

244.12 246.77 B: low i mean but the salaries are low 

246.57 248.12 A: oh 

246.86 251.88 B: and it's it would be very difficult for them to go back and and survive 

250.53 251.58 A: (( right )) 

251.76 260.95 A: oh i never knew that you know like when i was younger i used to [sigh] i i can recall going to the library with some of my friends we're talking about like middle school maybe six seven and eight grade 

252.02 252.95 B: you know 

260.22 261.23 B: mhm 

260.85 274.83 A: and reading these joke books and hearing a lot of the jokes about [sigh] it would be a joke with all ethnic jokes in it [sigh] but the polish jokes i never understood because i guess i never understood anything about polish people you know what i'm saying so 

267.56 268.52 B: yes 

272.44 273.70 B: mhm 

274.20 275.19 B: right 

274.97 277.65 A: i i didn't get a lot of it you know what i'm saying 

277.17 278.23 B: yes 

278.08 279.18 A: yeah 

278.39 288.17 B: yeah i do [sigh] i do and i'm not even polish you know at all [sigh] but i can see how they get highly offended especially some of our children are very bright they win 

281.28 282.53 A: oh okay 

282.64 283.60 A: yeah 

287.62 288.54 A: uh-huh 

288.07 299.29 B: [sigh] scholarships to highschool and college and all [sigh] and they take h- great offence at jokes that that talk about their intelligence or [sigh] that their heads are square or 

297.02 297.85 A: (( oh )) 

298.62 300.23 A: [laughter] 

299.24 302.90 B: something you know they they really get offended by it 

301.98 303.40 A: (( [laughter] oh right right )) 

302.71 316.72 B: and i i i'll admit before i taught there i you know i wasn't above repeating a polish joke that i would hear [sigh] i'm very careful about uh any kind of ethnic jokes now [sigh] because i guess i've seen first hand how they they can take total offence to it 

307.94 309.18 A: yeah right 

312.28 313.35 A: (( oh okay )) 

316.30 319.41 A: mhm okay do the kids speak english or do 

318.52 329.32 B: uh when they come some of them don't [sigh] some of them don't we have they're we they're taught to speak english in school [sigh] but and most of it they pick up from television so a lot of their english is 

320.35 321.36 A: okay 

324.08 324.82 A: oh 

325.06 326.32 A: (( okay mm )) 

328.89 332.82 A: so is there a large polish community or something like that in uh philadelphia 

331.25 343.11 B: yeah very large [sigh] in the right in the area that this school is there's a very large everything they [sigh] speak polish in the banks [sigh] in the doctors' offices and [sigh] yeah it is very large 

333.01 334.13 A: (( oh okay )) 

335.34 336.41 A: (( they're there yeah )) 

338.50 339.60 A: (( oh okay )) 

340.23 341.35 A: (( oh okay )) 

342.55 344.32 A: (( okay wow )) 

343.52 345.83 B: [sigh] but uh 

345.30 346.99 A: interesting okay 

347.31 358.46 A: [noise] yeah um so i i don't know uh [sigh] as far as comedy goes do you watch any is there any comedians that that you or that have e- that have ever entertained you that you really thought were funny 

358.08 359.56 B: um [sigh] 

358.79 360.83 A: either watching on t._v. or in person 

359.90 372.08 B: oh yeah well i i watch will and grace all the time i just got i'm watching that now [sigh] and it is uh i guess that's offensive to some homosexuals [laughter] [laughter] i don't know but it makes me laugh 

362.90 364.37 A: will and grace okay 

365.42 366.43 A: right 

366.87 368.79 A: i think that's a very funny show 

369.85 370.88 A: yeah 

371.64 375.86 A: okay right [laughter] because there's some truth to it uh 

372.44 378.24 B: you know it it makes me laugh i guess maybe because they poke fun at themselves i'm sorry what was that 

376.24 386.25 A: okay right okay go ahead no go ahead no i say 'cause y- you probably laugh 'cause [mn] some of it probably has a little truth to it and [sigh] some of it maybe is a little far fetched 

378.80 379.69 B: i i 

386.03 393.85 B: [sigh] it could be i actually had the opportunity last year to meet the man who writes [sigh] uh jack's character 

386.86 388.40 A: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

393.47 395.20 A: yeah 

394.09 396.39 B: and this man was homosexual himself 

395.77 397.62 A: oh okay okay 

396.50 405.67 B: and he acted just like jack and maybe that's why [sigh] uh i find so much humor in it i don't know but it's a funny show i think 

398.73 399.98 A: (( oh wow )) 

403.23 405.58 A: yeah okay uh-huh 

405.68 406.64 A: (( right )) 

405.70 407.80 B: [sigh] i think how about you 

407.61 411.88 A: uh well i just pretty much standup comedy uh 

412.01 416.23 A: (( [sigh] um i'm in i'm into like uh [sigh] )) 

416.33 421.06 A: shit right now i don't really watch any sitcoms but i used to like the martin lorna show 

418.75 419.74 B: mhm 

420.76 421.71 B: uh-huh 

421.38 428.11 A: and um but other than that just you know just a couple of standup comedians that i've i've enjoyed listening to 

428.14 438.29 A: [noise] but at and at the time even though they've been some of my favorite comedians some of the stuff that they talk about i i did find kinda like [sigh] like that's kind of way out there to talk about you know 

437.64 438.59 B: uh-huh 

438.47 440.06 A: (( like um )) 

440.24 444.10 A: richard pryor once told a joke about having a monkey and the monkey 

444.09 455.63 A: you know [mn] uh was in heat or whatever and and it stuck its dick in somebody's ear or some shit like that so you know [laughter] just you know stuff like that i thought was kinda like way out you know what i mean 

455.19 462.01 B: right i [sigh] yeah i remember bill cosby once saying that that richard pryor was such a funny man he didn't have to be so foul 

455.99 456.74 A: (( so )) 

461.88 463.47 A: okay yeah 

462.46 464.92 B: yeah i remember hearing that you know 

464.11 471.29 A: that that is ture some of his stuff he'd be like you know he'd already have you laughing it's like where did come that from that was coming 

470.17 476.19 B: you can't get you can't get pa- you can't get to some of his humor because you can't get past the profanity of it 

473.27 474.32 A: yeah 

475.40 477.96 A: (( right [mn] exactly )) 

477.30 485.37 B: yeah i have a hard time with that i have a hard time with and and sexual jokes i'm not real good with body part jokes

481.89 483.05 A: (( mhm )) 

484.83 495.29 A: oh okay all right okay okay i see all right um other than that um yeah i i would definitely have to say that uh [sigh] 

486.00 487.10 B: at all 

487.50 488.89 B: but 

495.56 503.13 A: uh some humor inspires people in- into some uh i guess it just all depends on 

503.41 506.59 A: [sigh] um how good you feel about yourself on the inside you 

506.33 507.28 B: right 

506.62 512.03 A: know whether or not you can take some of the [sigh] the stuff that uh comedians throw out there 

511.74 516.82 B: exactly [sigh] and some of it's easier to hear on t._v. than it is face to face stuff 

516.08 518.60 A: oh man yeah a lot easier 

517.98 528.75 B: i mean you can weigh three hundred pounds and sit at home and laugh about some jokes about fat people but if you're sitting in the audience [sigh] and all these eyes turn around at you and go hey there's the fat person sitting there 

522.65 523.56 A: true 

526.59 528.26 A: (( yeah )) 

528.48 531.10 A: oh exactly uh like 

529.77 532.87 B: y- you lose a little bit of the humor i guess 

531.92 543.54 A: mhm [lipsmack] there's one comedian i just recently uh went to the theatre and watched and [sigh] he had his family in the audience while he was and and the main theme of the his uh 

543.52 556.66 A: comedy was about dysfunctional family and he talked about every member in his family that pretty much you know had influence on him when he was growing up and [sigh] some of his jokes man you could just see his mum just turn 

552.32 553.31 B: mhm 

555.78 557.19 B: oh my lord 

556.63 561.74 A: like oh i don't believe he's talking about that you know what i'm saying and

568.67 579.18 A: you know why he didn't tell me he was going to say that he told me about this that and the other but he didn't mention he was going to mention that i was [mn] man it was so funny 

571.75 572.84 B: (( oh pshaw ))
