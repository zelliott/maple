5.47 7.32 A: me too this is my first call 

5.96 8.95 B: i didn't even catch what the topic was di- did 

8.27 13.26 A: it's comedy acceptable humor and what is in bad taste 

13.21 14.35 B: okay 

14.38 15.52 B: [laughter] 

15.56 23.65 B: well f- first of all ah i oh as it said i'll introduce myself ah my name is jeff and i'm in seattle

25.34 26.48 B: okay 

26.95 31.79 B: ah what is considered acceptable humor [laughter] um 

32.99 34.24 B: gosh 

36.57 39.20 B: [sigh] did it say in the workplace 

39.66 40.93 B: or did it just ex- 

39.70 43.12 A: no it just i think it was just meant in general life 

42.41 43.48 B: okay 

43.15 54.27 A: and you know 'cause i don't know the first says about comedy and then it's like what would you consider acceptable humor and then humor that or that would be in bad taste 

54.78 55.96 B: okay 

55.29 60.36 A: yeah i think it would depend a lot on you know like you said the workplace it'd be the atmosphere 

60.38 63.47 A: and also your relationship with the other people 

63.29 65.57 B: exactly yeah 

66.48 67.56 B: um 

68.67 72.55 B: yeah it's the it's kinda hard to pin down because um 

73.81 81.53 B: i i would think that ah [laughter] s- setting boundaries i mean i i've had many people s- s- you know 

81.64 91.15 B: say jokes to me that you know even people that i i thought i knew people pretty well that ah i i've found offensive so it's it's hard to say 

92.22 92.99 B: (( [sigh] )) 

93.18 96.38 B: w- what's acceptable i guess ah 

96.98 102.83 B: if if you were in doubt whatsoever at least if i was in doubt i i wouldn't [laughter] 

103.05 105.59 B: i wouldn't test the boundaries 

105.74 106.81 B: um 

107.48 109.20 B: but um 

110.42 111.76 B: i don't know 

113.97 115.97 B: what is acceptable 

116.31 131.01 A: well i think that like um like if i'm talking with one of my friends you know we might we'd tell jokes and think they're funny and everything but then if someone else that i was not really familiar with came and told me the same joke and you know i might would be offended 

122.61 123.39 B: (( ahah )) 

130.95 133.41 A: by that you know depending on 

133.63 136.58 A: if it's like a role like a sexual joke or 

136.31 137.29 B: right 

136.64 144.74 A: something like that you know if it was someone that i knew really well you know yeah we might think that was funny but if it was someone that you know we were at a 

144.92 152.61 A: you know table a group of people and they said something like that we might think you know that's just not the time for that you know we don't know you that well 

151.74 153.34 B: yeah 

153.08 154.92 A: you know stuff like that 

154.74 159.05 B: you would definitely have to know the person pretty well i'd 

158.58 159.77 A: right 

159.87 167.25 A: and you know and like a lot of people whenever they're drunk i guess they you know tend to think they're a lot more funny than they really are 

159.89 161.01 B: and 

165.13 166.27 B: [laughter] 

167.30 168.37 B: right 

168.74 174.87 B: and i would say in the workplace ah you would want to be especially careful 

176.25 178.78 B: [sigh] because you 

179.37 181.02 B: have many 

181.25 184.01 B: other parties present and ah 

186.77 188.50 B: it could be offensive 

189.05 193.08 A: right you actually never know who's really listening or anything like that 

192.84 195.56 B: exactly [laughter] 

194.92 200.83 A: [laughter] this is really funny i don't know that it's like they're testing like what you're supposed to really talk about 

200.22 201.38 B: i'm sorry what 

201.43 206.00 A: i said seem like they don't give you a little bit more of stuff like what you're supposed to talk about you know 

205.67 215.75 B: yeah like i said i kinda just i it it went out so quickly i i really wasn't prepared for i didn't even catch what the whole thing was what the premise was

221.86 222.45 A: (( [laughter] )) 

222.97 231.08 B: yeah okay [laughter] i know ah you know humor in the workplace you know in the wrong 

232.51 236.74 B: at the wrong time or at the wrong person could get you in a lot of hot water 

237.70 238.89 B: um 

241.90 244.23 B: (( [lipsmack] ah f- )) 

244.73 246.97 B: some could be perceived as

315.59 328.19 A: religious jokes you know about the jewish and the catholic you know going in about you know stuff like that that could be offensive to people depending on their type of you know religious preference and 

327.16 328.31 B: right 

328.56 329.78 A: and that 

329.77 333.85 B: i grew up in a farming community and where we had a lot of ah

347.79 349.37 B: (( but um )) 

351.26 352.87 B: yeah

357.48 359.65 B: (( [lipsmack] really )) 

360.89 362.08 B: um 

360.97 362.86 A: possibly [laughter] [laughter]

415.12 418.75 B: oh yeah me too i messed up the time before 

419.42 420.89 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

423.40 424.97 B: (( hm )) 

425.92 427.25 B: well 

426.36 429.91 A: okay so what would be some more acceptable humor that you could think of 

428.70 431.03 B: (( ac- ac- acceptable )) 

430.56 432.13 A: mhm 

433.02 438.81 B: well i don't know i [sigh] eee [sigh] 

438.93 447.41 B: you know because even like political jokes could be considered offensive i guess i don't know you know in a in a certain lights um 

442.96 444.10 A: right 

447.51 451.02 A: i guess i just guess it depends on the atmosphere that you're in and if 

451.14 453.41 A: you know the time and the place and 

453.62 460.07 B: it definitely would depend on yes the the crowd that the the company you were with 

461.07 462.58 B: and um 

464.43 465.02 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

465.09 467.44 B: the the situation 

468.02 470.08 B: but ah 

470.61 472.64 B: acceptable 

475.01 479.23 B: would probably be pretty 

480.48 482.68 B: clean pretty 

486.91 488.64 B: p- probably corny 

488.94 490.75 A: (( yeah something like that )) 

490.07 491.38 B: um 

493.83 495.46 B: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] [laughter] )) 

497.07 499.55 B: i am not sure 

498.55 504.66 A: and maybe things that you're like telling about yourself that was funny you know if you were like making fun of yourself 

505.01 505.76 B: (( both )) 

505.24 507.43 A: rather than someone else you know 

507.51 516.92 B: true yes i guess that would be considered hum- but i i guess i perceived it to be like jokes so i dunno 

517.26 518.30 A: oh true 

520.13 521.42 B: (( [sigh] um )) 

527.75 533.47 B: (( [sigh] ah t- t- t- t- inoffensive jokes would )) 

533.90 534.75 B: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

539.14 544.83 B: it's hard to say because ah i could see how most things could could possibly offend someone 

547.61 552.22 B: but [sigh] hard to pin down so where abouts in dallas are you 

552.56 555.64 A: um actually i just live right outside of dallas 

557.82 560.13 B: (( i know somebody that also [noise] lives outside of dallas ))
