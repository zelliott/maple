23.12 26.78 A: acceptable comedy and comedy that's in poor taste 

26.17 27.67 B: (( i ))

30.75 36.13 B: [sigh] you know who's listening uh you know and regular on 

36.26 40.28 B: daytime t._v. or something where kids can get hold of it or anything you got to 

40.30 45.81 B: take it easy but i i think the rest of the time i think it's just if it doesn't hurt anybody 

41.54 42.48 A: yeah 

46.14 47.06 B: (( you know )) 

47.95 49.56 A: yeah yeah 

49.67 59.82 A: what about you what about you personally though like you know like if somebody's even like making a joke against you what would you think [sigh] where would it be in poor taste and where would it be [sigh] 

60.06 62.98 A: in uh you know okay for you 

63.12 74.47 B: well in poor taste [sigh] i don't know about that i mean there's things that bothered me i mean i grew up with the name forrest [sigh] so [laughter] imagine imagine that i heard a few things but you know there are 

70.91 71.91 A: yeah 

75.12 78.30 B: i don't think it's fair making fun of somebody but um 

78.45 84.82 B: just making a joke [sigh] i don't know you know i i d- i'm not i don't go in for the racist stuff 

84.96 89.37 B: (( [sigh] you know so uh uh but if somebody's )) 

85.07 86.25 A: yeah 

89.20 103.25 B: making uh jokes like that around me [sigh] i'll my my backside might get a little stiff but otherwise i don't really react much to it 'cause [sigh] you know you can't change people uh that have already you know sort of 

103.34 105.32 B: gotten their way of doing things 

105.67 118.00 B: [sigh] but but but if i if there if there's a discussion about it i make my my uh feelings clear about it and if i'm going to be around somebody very often i would sort of tell 'em hey you know i d- i don't really much go in for that kind of thing 

105.68 107.49 A: yeah 

118.20 119.29 B: (( [sigh] but )) 

118.29 122.11 A: yeah yeah 

120.66 124.42 B: but i think people are a little too sensitive about about a lot of things though [lipsmack] 

125.12 126.42 B: you know like uh 

125.73 128.40 A: yeah yeah i'm i'm sort of with you 

128.50 134.59 B: yeah well you that guy that um god i'm i'm well i forgot his name but he he had that uh [sigh] oh 

135.63 138.44 B: that that politically incorrect show 

138.40 139.90 A: bill marr 

139.64 153.32 B: yeah yeah and he made a he made a joke that uh basically got him fired and i don't think that's right you know i mean everybody was real sensitive about [sigh] the nine eleven stuff that happened but uh i mean that's that's his job you know he he 

140.41 141.31 A: yeah 

152.53 154.03 A: yeah 

153.09 156.54 B: [sigh] yeah the name of the show was politically incorrect 

156.24 157.47 A: yeah 

156.38 162.45 B: [laughter] [laughter] you know what i mean it would be like if somebody uh hired you for a job uh 

162.29 171.84 B: [sigh] you know of throwing water balloons and and then fired you one day because they didn't like the way you were throwing one at somebody or something like that it it it's just ridiculous you know 

168.74 170.66 A: right 

171.81 182.03 A: sure sure yeah i i mean i like a lot not all the time but i like a lot of comedy that pushes buttons like that you know 

181.51 182.93 B: yeah yeah 

182.11 186.17 A: that uh that does kinda risque stuff so 

186.61 192.93 A: i mean for me i you know a lot of people i mean like that whole bill bill marr thing you know i mean i 

193.05 201.88 A: that didn't i didn't find that to be in poor taste or offensive when when he made those comments i didn't see the particular show but uh 

197.51 198.34 B: no 

201.52 209.56 B: well what he said was that uh uh he s- he basically said that we're calling these people that hit the world trade centre cowardly 

209.40 216.93 B: well how about sending cruise missiles uh you know in a off from a distance that's more cowardly and [sigh] and in a 

214.70 218.24 A: right right 'cause we're not even looking 'em in the face 

218.00 225.71 B: l- i mean uh he made a he kinda you know uh should have known he was going to piss some people off there because where everybody was really sensitive 

225.78 238.75 B: right at that time i think if he made the d- if he had waited until now and made the joke i think he wouldn't have uh raised an eyebrow here you know but right then everybody was about ready to you know go crazy over what happened [sigh] you 

226.00 227.03 A: yeah 

227.28 228.49 A: yeah 

238.20 239.35 A: yeah 

238.78 247.83 B: know so again that's what i'm saying i when i said the audi- you know it depends on the audience [sigh] i think that it really does because you know it also depends on 

248.15 253.27 B: not the audience isn't just who you're talking to it's when you're talking to 'em [sigh] 

252.84 261.97 A: [lipsmack] i think it also it depends on kind of the back the attitude in the background of the person that's making the joke 'cause i mean 

260.05 261.11 B: yeah yeah 

262.03 266.50 A: you know i've i've i've done some comedy myself and [sigh] you know there are times when 

264.85 265.68 B: (( oh yeah )) 

266.51 271.28 A: when i i would see people performing or or do some performing myself where you know 

271.63 274.92 A: some things get said that are that are pretty uh 

276.07 285.00 A: that are pretty raw pretty out there you know and and sometimes you can tell if it's coming from a real kind of mean spirited place where it just feels 

278.36 279.53 B: oh yeah yeah 

285.09 298.38 A: you know kinda ugly and gross and then sometimes you get that it's coming from a place where it's [sigh] just a- allowing everybody to kinda you know re- have a little release you know let off some tension and and laugh about something that uh 

285.46 286.08 B: (( yeah )) 

295.53 296.46 B: yeah right 

298.97 301.35 A: you know laugh about something that 

299.21 305.25 B: yeah it's it's it's the emotions that are behind it and just how the person feels who's doin' it yeah 

302.18 303.58 A: yeah 

304.69 306.93 A: yeah yeah 

306.31 312.30 B: so i think that's what [mn] but i but poor taste jeeze i don't know i think that's a pretty old um 

312.41 316.24 B: way of um you know that's an old fashioned way of of of putting it 

314.67 320.69 A: [laughter] yeah [lipsmack] are you familiar with are you familiar with the old comedian andy coffman 

316.45 317.19 B: (( you know )) 

320.97 332.52 B: yeah yeah he he d- [sigh] he did stuff that would that uh would you know bug me [sigh] but you know to to sit back in judgment and call it poor taste oh man 

321.71 323.40 A: yeah i mean 

331.70 333.24 A: yeah 

333.25 347.61 A: you know like his whole the whole wrestling thing he did you know i mean it really pushed a lot of people's buttons because [sigh] you know some- sometimes what's funny is the fact that [sigh] that some of the audience doesn't get it they don't realise that the whole thing is meant to be a big spoof 

339.66 340.39 B: yeah 

344.56 345.36 B: yeah 

347.53 354.17 A: so they're getting all you know angry at him and upset and and you know freaking out over all what he's doing [sigh] 

347.79 348.84 B: right right 

354.16 365.81 A: and to me that was kinda funny because it was like you guys don't get it you're getting really really upset about something uh that's just it's just you you know mean to be a big spoof 

354.17 354.95 B: yeah 

361.50 362.29 B: yeah 

365.72 374.73 B: yeah right [sigh] and you know when when it comes to to uh other kinds of poor taste like you know um [sigh] you're always going to hurt somebody's feelings i'm afraid [sigh] 

374.74 381.33 B: you know it's like uh yeah something like the jon benet ramsay thing happens uh there's going to be jokes about it 

381.99 386.01 B: you know what i mean and guess what the the family of those people 

384.33 389.46 A: (( yeah )) 

386.44 391.69 B: and even some of the some people that just were moved by it and have kids of there own 

391.74 393.78 B: are going to be offended by it 

393.71 395.40 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

393.93 397.46 B: but i don't i don't think that makes it in poor taste you 

397.45 402.85 B: know what i mean i think that's just a the you know grow up and live in the real world you know we d- we uh 

402.73 403.58 B: (( um )) 

403.35 418.04 B: [sigh] pay people to make jokes and and make us laugh and these aren't uh people that go to eight year colleges in order to learn how to do it [sigh] they're people that are just there using their own funny bone and trying to you know do the best job that they can you know [sigh] 

418.06 430.85 B: and i'd say if the whole audience laughs at it uh maybe you're wrong [laughter] you know what i mean i mean if they if if if they're up there and everybody's laughing at 'em then you know it isn't it 

425.57 427.56 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

430.72 440.75 B: you know you got to uh people have to quit with this um the rest of the army's out of step [sigh] [lipsmack] thing you know [sigh] i mean just just just take a pill or something i don't know 

437.34 439.43 A: (( yeah )) 

440.39 442.45 A: [laughter] 

440.79 442.73 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

442.45 455.23 A: yeah you know there there there are what what does cross the line for you though because i i i witnessed something uh a number of weeks back that did cross the line for me um so i i was 

442.84 443.81 B: (( i don't )) 

452.54 453.49 B: what's that 

455.07 458.83 A: i was uh i was at this at this club and um 

459.15 460.54 A: (( and there was a )) 

460.65 468.34 A: and you know people were doing comedy you know people it was like an open mike thing so people would get up and just do like five minutes [noise] of of comedy and uh 

466.20 466.94 B: yeah

476.47 478.71 A: um well the uh this 

478.79 487.25 A: c- a lot of guys were giving a lot of hell to this one woman who was sitting in the front and um and uh 

484.44 485.06 B: yeah 

487.04 494.57 A: you know i mean she was just kind of sitting there with a little bit of a cold stare on her face she she was laughing some but she was not like you know 

494.41 507.33 A: it was it was kind of a tough room anyway she just happened to be the focal point of it and people were kind of picking on her right there and then you know and then and then it comes comes to be that she was there to actually do some comedy and so she got up and it was her first time ever 

500.41 501.20 B: yeah 

507.13 516.56 A: [sigh] first time ever and she gets up and she does her five minutes and she wasn't great she was okay but she definitely put a lot of she was a little stiff but she put a lot of 

517.25 522.07 B: (( mm )) 

517.64 519.42 A: a lot of effort into 

519.30 521.41 A: for sure and then this 

521.19 525.77 A: this guy gets up uh towards the end [noise] uh 

525.65 537.32 A: and that and the thing is she had ma- been making some jokes with this guy like they were kind of playing along with each other he gets up there and looks at her and goes you know you can sit out there with that judgmental stare on everybody all night 

531.27 532.13 B: (( yeah right )) 

537.19 542.12 A: and then you have the nerve to get up here and suck when it's your turn 

541.07 541.90 B: [laughter] 

542.21 547.30 A: and i mean it was kind of a funny comment and it was but it was so 

542.35 543.34 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

547.17 560.66 A: angry behind it because then he didn't let up i mean he did not let up he was just like you know and he just was went off i mean he was calling her and he was calling her n- bad names [sigh] 

548.34 549.18 B: yeah 

551.44 552.79 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

560.55 564.63 A: it brought it brought her to the edge of tears and she left 

560.76 561.48 B: yeah 

563.99 574.99 B: right [sigh] yeah well see that's the thing that is if you [sigh] you know it's one thing if if uh you know it's unavoidable to hurt some people's feelings if you're really hitting topics and stuff [sigh] but 

564.98 566.13 A: i mean 

574.11 575.01 A: sure 

574.89 584.00 B: you know his his intention was to hurt somebody [sigh] so i would that that's that's that you know i i would draw the line at that if i if i if i start

582.01 585.59 A: yeah see to me that 

584.37 599.35 B: you know if i was at a club at a club and i saw something like that and um you know bought it you know in other words i don't think it's some kind of set up or something she really did leave in tears and it's [mn] pretty obvious that he did that to her [sigh] i'd at least at the very least got up too and left [sigh] 

599.18 599.89 A: yeah 

599.19 599.89 B: (( you know ))
