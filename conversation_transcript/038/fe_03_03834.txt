1.02 5.10 A: hi this is sherry and i'm in tennessee 

4.57 7.93 B: hi this is linda and i'm in massachusetts how are you 

7.83 12.70 A: oh not bad at all not bad at all i bet you've you've got my type of humor 

12.43 15.92 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

13.22 16.44 A: (( [laughter] i )) 

16.77 21.73 A: down here in tennessee it is a slightly different type of humor [laughter] 

20.65 21.49 B: i'm 

22.03 28.93 B: i'm not sure i mean humor is a difficult topic um everybody has their own 

29.23 30.62 B: definition 

31.05 33.25 B: of what's funny um 

31.46 32.02 A: (( [mn] )) 

34.38 37.53 B: i definitely i i don't think i find um 

38.96 40.77 B: racial jokes to be funny 

41.01 42.28 B: i don't 

41.13 41.97 A: (( no mhm )) 

42.30 43.43 B: um 

44.61 45.73 B: but 

45.98 49.18 B: i mean off color jokes are fine i think 

49.94 53.98 B: in certain company if you're comfortable and you're good friends with somebody 

54.99 60.03 B: you know what their level of comfort is so you can share something like that with somebody you know 

60.32 62.73 B: but i would say not in mixed company 

62.96 64.79 B: with the people that you don't know 

63.22 63.93 A: (( mhm )) 

65.08 69.11 A: well it's definitely it's not ah the company i work for 

69.02 80.77 A: has very very strict rules about that which is good they have very strong and very strict rules about what you can and can't say um [mn] 

72.75 73.51 B: (( mhm )) 

79.14 80.23 B: mhm 

81.14 92.86 A: diversity is one of their mainly ah main focuses is on diversity in the workplace they have people from around the world who work here 

92.58 93.71 B: mhm 

93.06 96.67 A: and um higher level engineers 

97.16 103.23 A: management and so forth so they're very very careful not to hurt anyone's feelings 

102.88 103.89 B: mhm 

103.70 104.55 A: so 

104.60 105.30 A: (( i- )) 

106.05 110.29 A: in general there's still a certain amount of humor that 

110.62 115.88 A: people say oh well maybe i shouldn't have said that and everybody else says oh it doesn't matter you know come on 

113.12 114.17 B: mhm 

115.71 116.64 B: mhm 

115.93 116.64 A: (( you know )) 

116.70 118.95 A: so um 

119.11 126.74 A: it's ah it's like your racial humor is unacceptable when it is 

126.79 129.08 A: designed to put someone down 

128.74 129.75 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

129.96 131.13 A: to 

131.35 134.14 A: hurt someone else's feelings 

133.75 134.67 B: mhm 

134.97 136.48 A: um 

137.72 140.48 A: sexual jokes are 

140.89 145.71 A: inappropriate depending ah most of the time i find it inappropriate 

145.75 148.59 A: but as you said depending on the 

148.98 150.82 A: company that you're with 

150.46 151.63 B: mhm 

150.97 154.73 A: um if they're mild and they're light hearted 

155.36 159.19 A: that's one thing but when they're down and dirty 

158.72 160.15 B: mhm 

159.21 164.41 A: you know i'm more than ready to walk away and say in disgust 

164.66 171.38 A: so you know i think most of us feel that way i think people have become much more sensitive to 

167.28 168.82 B: (( mhm )) 

171.47 179.80 A: the feelings of others as the world goes smaller and we're more exposed to a large variety of people 

181.76 184.87 A: of course up there where you're at you probably get 

186.36 190.53 A: a large number of people from all different countries correct 

190.20 192.35 B: yes we have 

191.90 192.46 A: (( [mn] )) 

192.85 200.90 B: a variety of different countries it depends on where you're at um the smaller suburbs doesn't have such a diverse mix 

201.01 204.20 B: but when you're in a big city 

205.51 207.75 B: like our neighboring town is brogden 

207.81 214.50 B: there there's a wide mix of different cultures as well as boston where i'm originally from [mn] 

214.83 218.48 B: nigeria haiti everywhere you can imagine 

217.27 218.25 A: mhm 

219.04 221.13 B: um vietnam laos 

221.31 222.98 B: everywhere [laughter] 

222.40 223.51 A: mhm 

223.76 225.65 B: so um i think 

225.83 238.02 B: you do become very sensitive you if you don't want somebody telling a [mn] if you would be offended by that joke if it was said about your nationality then i'd say then don't say it about somebody else's 

237.46 243.24 A: right right it's sort of become much more um 

244.36 249.89 A: a custom to accepting other cultures and other 

250.11 251.15 A: um 

251.65 256.23 A: ways of life and other habits um yeah 

257.08 262.93 A: at one time i think humor was used as a way of saying 

263.69 265.07 A: us and them 

265.45 266.57 B: mhm 

266.73 275.20 A: and that's much less acceptable humor was more a way of making other people feel like outsiders 

276.44 283.57 A: and now it's more inclined to be used as a way of bringing people into a group 

283.75 286.44 A: or including them into a group 

286.41 287.24 B: (( mhm )) 

286.56 289.98 A: so humor is much less focused on 

290.47 291.72 A: poking 

292.44 294.82 A: cruel fun at them 

294.56 295.50 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

295.71 297.69 A: than it is on 

298.16 299.01 A: just 

299.57 309.26 A: ah pointing up and emphasizing something that may be a little humorous ah teasing a little more teasing 

309.17 310.20 B: mhm 

309.99 313.56 A: well of course then you've got jeff foxworthy 

314.19 317.22 B: (( mhm [laughter] true )) 

314.82 322.78 A: [laughter] [laughter] but he does it in such a broad humored way 

322.33 323.83 B: now is he 

323.53 324.28 A: mhm 

324.16 327.41 B: originally where is he originally from do you know 

330.52 332.24 A: [sigh] he's from the south 

332.04 333.68 B: okay so i 

332.71 334.78 A: i'm not sure where but 

333.97 336.38 B: guess it's okay to poke fun 

336.78 340.06 B: at your own group but not others maybe 

338.53 339.42 A: mhm 

340.22 341.19 A: mhm 

341.53 347.82 B: i i think that's acceptable but i couldn't i mean in a workplace i don't think 

347.95 352.60 B: i would ever tell anything that's like considered 

353.46 358.17 B: off color in the least bit i [mn] would think that that would be just absolutely 

359.17 361.31 B: not tolerated 

359.39 360.31 A: yeah it's 

360.76 364.28 A: it's not it's definitely not here and uh 

362.72 364.14 B: mhm 

364.62 367.74 A: i think more and more places are 

368.32 369.95 A: becoming 

370.31 371.11 A: (( uh )) 

371.70 380.66 A: stricter about that um the south is behind other areas in doing that unless you work for a big company like this 

373.44 375.35 B: mhm 

381.31 387.29 A: so your smaller areas and your smaller towns are still struggling with 

387.65 388.96 A: um 

389.72 391.39 A: learning to 

392.85 402.49 A: not isolate themselves so much and again [mn] a lot of them use humor as a cruel tool to 

395.13 396.15 B: mhm 

402.66 407.23 A: separate themselves and to make themselves superior 

407.85 412.49 B: do you think that that's due to um not having much interaction with other 

412.56 413.96 B: other cultures 

413.81 414.82 A: yes 

415.00 416.31 A: very much so 

415.08 416.43 B: those areas 

416.98 418.31 A: very much so 

417.84 419.06 B: mhm 

418.41 426.77 A: um 'cause i from living down here we moved down here in ninety four and i was from upstate new york 

426.89 430.10 A: syracuse area and 

428.09 429.28 B: mhm 

430.16 436.94 A: i noticed that the people here seemed to be about forty to fifty years behind 

437.50 439.62 A: the cosmopolitan 

440.07 444.82 A: attitudes and acceptance that i found in the syracuse area 

444.55 445.46 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

445.96 450.45 A: they're coming along ah it's they're just behind 

450.19 451.17 B: mhm 

451.85 466.74 A: although when you reach get into a company like i'm working with this is one that is an international company that has offices all around the world that has employees from around the world and they make a very firm 

467.79 475.06 A: stance on diversity and emphatically let you know what is acceptable and what is not 

474.70 475.65 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

475.91 477.04 A: (( and )) 

477.10 480.13 A: but your smaller companies your 

480.94 482.74 A: smaller towns [mn] 

482.82 484.38 A: even your 

484.53 488.24 A: police officers your fire departments or 

488.25 489.54 A: your 

489.91 491.87 A: government officials 

491.43 492.32 B: mhm 

492.00 493.97 A: ah and employees 

494.09 497.33 A: they're not as accepting of diversity 

497.71 501.98 A: and the smaller the town the less accepting they are and the more 

502.33 504.66 A: cruel their humor could be 

505.43 506.29 A: (( so )) 

506.66 508.82 A: yeah but humor is 

510.27 514.80 A: [mn] when used to make someone feel like part of the group is 

515.47 516.96 A: is enjoyable 

516.76 518.73 B: exactly to everybody 

517.77 519.71 A: yeah yeah 

520.36 521.11 A: uh
