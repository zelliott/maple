150.75 154.83 A: try to find adoption agencies we we're going to adopt a little boy 

154.45 155.75 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

154.89 156.81 A: and the phone rang [laughter]

160.19 161.84 B: oh so that's neat 

161.89 167.21 A: yeah we have a nine year old but we want another one either five to seven years old 

167.51 171.52 A: from another country so i'm trying checking out all these sites 

171.65 174.98 A: it's really more difficult to find than i thought it would be i 

174.43 175.43 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

175.60 176.99 A: (( don't know why )) 

177.43 179.85 B: yeah i think it takes a while too 

179.83 180.90 A: yeah 

181.81 189.19 A: this is adoption network yeah it is supposed to take a while and that's okay we'll just as long as it takes we'll do it 

188.89 189.98 B: mhm 

190.77 192.06 B: well that's neat 

191.96 196.41 A: yeah we're pretty excited we're just starting the process though 

193.81 194.95 B: yeah 

196.45 198.51 A: so that's going to take a while we'll 

198.85 200.77 A: have to get passports i guess 

200.73 206.40 B: mhm mhm yeah i'm going through that now with my daughter because she's going on a trip to brazil with a friend 

206.16 208.01 A: oh so you're getting her passport does 

207.39 209.90 B: oh yeah [sigh] it's crazy 

208.51 210.38 A: that take a long time to do 

209.97 221.91 B: well i guess um from what they tell me at the post office 'cause you have to get a small picture and we did that yesterday and then you have to fill out a form and then it's supposed to take about four or five weeks 

215.11 216.04 A: uh-huh 

221.23 222.44 A: weeks 

222.17 225.76 B: yeah for them to um issue it 

223.68 224.85 A: (( wow mhm )) 

225.89 228.06 B: so i don't know exactly what they do 

228.64 235.90 B: to issue it and then for her depending on the country you're going to you might have to get a visa for like brazil we have to get a visa for her 

235.91 242.44 B: which means we have to go either to new york city or washington d._c. to the consulate to get 

241.52 243.24 A: you have to go there 

242.87 253.87 B: well that's what they say between certain hours but then my aunt um mailed me um some websites there's companies out there that will do it for you for about a hundred dollars 

251.86 252.75 A: oh 

253.31 254.96 A: oh that would be worth it though 

254.23 259.26 B: yeah it's worth it for me 'cause i'm in connecticut and it's a pain in the neck to go into new york [laughter] 

256.39 256.95 A: (( [mn] )) 

258.25 259.78 A: oh i'll bet 

259.55 262.39 B: so um i'm that's what i thought i would do 

261.84 265.36 A: i didn't realise it took so long four weeks or more 

264.84 270.72 B: well i guess people are getting um in trouble because now with all the security measures 

270.92 281.87 B: they're um booking all these really cheap trips to foreign countries but they don't realize that they might need a passport and a visa and they're kind of getting shafted that way so 

278.11 279.55 A: oh 

281.85 283.53 A: oh 

282.91 285.20 B: you have to be careful i guess 

284.44 289.89 A: we should probably just go ahead and get our passports now or at least start the paperwork mhm 

287.43 288.63 B: yeah 'cause they 

289.20 301.96 B: yeah 'cause they told me that they're good for five years 'cause that's another thing too if you're going to a country and it's going to expire in like six months a lot of times they will deny you a visa because they want you to have it good for at least a year 

301.54 302.78 A: oh 

302.72 305.96 B: [laughter] learning all these things 

303.48 304.99 A: oh boy 

305.35 307.16 A: too many little rules 

306.84 310.22 B: yeah [laughter] i was kind of sorry i told my daughter she could go [laughter] 

309.48 313.00 A: [laughter] well she'll have a great time though how old is she 

311.88 319.53 B: oh yeah she's thirteen and it's really good friends and they they they are from brazil so they speak the language and 

313.58 315.41 A: oh that'll be 

318.73 319.83 A: mhm 

319.59 320.72 B: and 

319.84 322.01 A: oh they'll know where to go and everything then 

320.96 325.68 B: yeah yeah and there's lots of family over there so it's are a really great opportunity 

323.90 328.41 A: (( what a what a good opportunity for her she'll always remember that )) 

326.26 327.34 B: yeah 

327.65 334.16 B: yeah and it's it's only costing us the air flight so she doesn't have to stay in a hotel they're going to stay with relatives um 

330.63 331.70 A: oh 

333.96 338.08 A: how neat oh she'll always remember that make sure she takes a camera 

334.87 335.89 B: yeah 

337.66 340.75 B: yeah yeah i'm excited for her 

338.29 339.49 A: (( [laughter] )) 

339.98 341.94 A: i'll bet [laughter] 

341.08 342.51 B: [laughter] 

342.77 349.77 A: we were going to go to italy this year for our fifteen year anniversary and decided to not to go and to adopt instead [laughter] 

348.88 350.44 B: oh 

350.50 353.74 B: well adopting will be better [laughter] 

352.55 354.65 A: yeah i think so too 

354.02 354.97 B: yeah 

354.72 359.15 A: we just have the one little guy and it'll be nice for him to have somebody too 

358.75 361.21 B: mhm yeah 

361.94 365.18 A: so we'll see we'll see how this goes 

362.39 363.30 B: (( definitely )) 

365.43 367.98 A: there's a lot of stuff to fill out 

367.46 371.59 B: yeah a i think it costs quite a bit of money too from what people say 

370.13 371.41 A: yeah 

371.77 373.08 A: it does it 

373.17 375.26 A: does but it'll be worth it 

375.02 376.26 B: yeah 

375.70 379.22 A: it's really the gift that keeps on costing actually 

378.71 379.84 B: (( yeah [laughter] ))
