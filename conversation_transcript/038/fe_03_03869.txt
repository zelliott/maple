44.90 47.16 B: i think we have to discuss comedy 

46.99 48.35 A: yes we do 

48.04 50.70 B: yeah and whether or not um 

50.77 55.03 B: we can easily draw the line between what's offensive and what's not 

54.41 56.53 A: right like i guess and 

56.69 58.02 A: eddie murphy 

57.82 60.15 B: (( yeah he ))

60.72 64.55 B: especially um lenny bruce which is brutal 

64.36 68.58 A: that you know what that was before my time i know who he is but that's 

66.65 67.55 B: really 

67.96 72.20 B: well eddie murphy is pretty crazy too dating transvestites horse and things 

72.10 76.83 A: yeah he um had that um movie in the eighties 

77.40 82.94 A: um it was about a two hour movie and it was funny 

83.50 86.12 A: but it wasn't the best date movie 

85.93 93.86 B: i didn't even see those things to tell the truth i mean i know before i even considered going that i'm not going to like it from experience but uh 

93.58 96.77 A: right right yeah 

95.89 99.37 B: but sometimes though on t._v. and sometimes you have a look 

99.13 106.46 A: right i think um robin williams now he's funny he's funny in a good way he doesn't offend anybody 

106.76 112.67 B: yeah sometimes he's questionable and he rambles on but he's very funny and i don't think he's objectionable 

112.92 116.31 A: yeah yeah if you can keep up with him [laughter] 

115.37 116.64 B: [laughter] 

116.34 118.77 A: that's that's the hard part 

119.35 120.46 A: um 

120.97 124.28 B: there used to be more sophisticated in general more 

124.37 130.17 B: humour and not it it's strange but it's sort of a sign of times i mean the movies are very different to 

130.26 131.24 A: right 

130.96 133.64 B: almost everything you see is objectionable 

133.36 136.07 A: exactly it's like the the um 

136.51 140.00 A: kind of makes you feel old but the music right now 

140.05 145.83 A: how it it's changed with the rap music just not just good rap like it used to be 

142.28 144.01 B: yeah really horrible 

145.89 148.75 A: um and i think comedy is like that too 

148.77 150.90 B: and it's kind of like rock and roll to 

151.70 158.72 B: that you don't have simple melodies anymore you don't have simple messages and you don't have romantic music you have kind of a whale 

159.18 161.13 A: it's yeah yeah it's 

161.28 162.84 A: just [laughter] 

161.86 171.96 B: but in comedy it's it's i don't know i think a lot of people are very very funny with complaining comedy like the monologues on the tonight show kind of thing and the 

171.75 178.80 B: political humour is very funny also but it is objectionable sometimes you see things that are so cruel 

178.46 185.33 A: right you do i know you watch something and it's like wow i can't believe they just said that but you're laughing at the same time 

182.73 183.83 B: [laughter] 

185.47 188.31 A: i think it's the way that they say it 

188.45 190.63 A: (( um on seinfield )) 

191.14 192.16 A: when 

192.20 194.99 A: (( the girl uh the )) 

195.22 199.67 A: some girl thought that that seinfield and that jerry and and um 

200.47 208.26 A: whatever i'm thinking of their real names um were gay and they're like well not like there's anything wrong with it i mean that made it funny 

208.09 209.03 B: really 

208.26 215.88 A: they're like well we're not gay we're really not gay not that there's anything wrong with it they followed every time they said that they followed it up with that 

215.96 220.46 A: and and no one can take offense to that it was just so funny the way they said that 

220.11 228.19 B: but lots of times people are very funny and they're just totally tearing somebody apart and it you know who they are it's some person in the news 

228.69 232.67 B: it's some celebrity and they're just ripping them to shreds 

232.05 235.52 A: yeah well also although when you're in the business 

237.10 241.23 A: you know that's going to happen anyway i mean you are out there in the public eye 

239.36 251.75 B: i don't know i guess so i guess so but i think a lot of people suffer anyway i think that it's difficult i mean someone like nick nolte for example with those photos they kept on showing that we [laughter] 

250.18 255.51 A: i saw that photo he looked like he just woke up from a bad something trip 

254.46 266.26 B: [laughter] [laughter] and it's it's still demeaning to him i mean i know some people who are famous and i know that they suffer i mean they suffer over the thought that someone thinks their hair plugs even they're upset 

266.37 273.74 B: that someone thinks they've had liposuction or a face lift kind of well if that's that's really embarrasses people 

273.48 277.42 A: yeah well i guess again when you're people talk 

277.69 282.12 A: people are jealous and they can be small minded 

281.60 295.23 B: yeah and it's it's humiliating it's humiliating and it's it's still a way of releasing um pain in other words people are so upset with what's happening sometimes that i think when they see these things which makes them happy that someone is brave enough to comment 

295.66 296.60 A: yeah 

296.61 297.75 A: yeah 

297.58 299.11 B: but essentially 

299.42 306.14 B: it's like a scapegoating kind of thing that's happening and basically general humour like the other stuff that isn't 

306.15 314.11 B: and takes a long time to show and stuff that is spontaneous every night on those talk shows it's it's so destructive 

311.48 312.50 A: right 

314.04 315.14 A: you know what i don't 

314.17 315.87 B: and it's so unnecessary 

315.57 318.74 A: i know i don't watch the talk shows anymore 

318.79 319.90 A: um 

320.48 330.52 A: usually watching something on t._v. land when it was t._v. was good and it was it was good and wholesome you know i watched that a lot and 

330.81 338.89 A: um but you hear about a lot of it on the news the next day something jay lenno had said or or um 

339.23 345.18 A: you know something that might of happened on david letterman you hear about those things in the news 

344.79 356.24 B: and politicians are so ridiculed i mean so ridiculed it's like no one's left standing if if you take that seriously if you think well there's no sense of people respecting anybody really 

355.85 358.65 A: yeah [mn] oh excuse me 

359.47 360.51 A: sorry 

360.37 361.84 B: [laughter] 

360.85 364.31 A: i fell asleep earlier and i haven't been able to wake up since 

364.03 364.81 B: (( that's )) 

364.97 379.27 A: but yeah i know i think it's best in everyday life to have the best sense of humour that you can and you can't make fun of someone else unless you i mean yeah you can't make fun of someone else if you can't make fun of yourself 

378.89 380.64 B: (( alright yeah sometimes it's )) 

380.84 383.29 B: pathetic and it's it's good um 

383.38 396.62 B: laugh at someone to get rid of the feeling that um well maybe the person is doing the wrong thing and and maybe some star is a crazy degenerate and everyone's paying money for that and admiring that and worshiping that and even 

396.60 402.86 B: so when people are pulled apart it it breaks down the hostility you have if you think something isn't right 

402.42 405.88 A: right right right well yeah laughter is i 

406.38 409.48 A: think a cure for what ails you it's 

409.58 415.32 A: if it's if it's genuinely funny um remember george carlan 

415.27 416.40 B: yeah 

415.76 422.85 A: yeah he was funny he was funny and he had what what how what what seven course words you can't say on t._v. i think it was 

423.35 429.57 A: and it again it was the way he said it which made it so funny but it words were like oh my god 

429.47 433.26 B: but he says it a lot to those those um 

433.55 439.25 B: honest jokes he made in those out spoken things had to say and his career was kind of a mess 

439.29 443.51 A: well yeah and i mean back and at that time 

443.63 444.75 A: it uh 

444.87 449.74 A: that was um a lot it was it was not of that time 

450.05 451.12 A: to be 

451.72 456.93 A: [laughter] god i really feel old when i say that because that was not that young 

457.21 459.84 A: when that came out but um 

460.22 465.55 A: it's weird because if that came out now it would be more acceptable than it was back then 

464.93 470.66 B: yeah woody allen is the kind of person used to make what were considered sharp jokes when he was young 

470.92 475.95 B: and he never seemed to have any problem assimilating into main stream 

475.70 480.36 A: right right yeah he [mn] i'm so sorry for doing this again 

481.47 482.31 A: (( oh )) 

482.38 484.29 A: god sorry 

485.45 487.40 A: work was rough early today 

487.12 488.12 B: what do you do 

488.75 490.18 A: i'm a sales agent 

490.74 491.56 B: (( where )) 

491.29 494.46 A: um i do um insurance and i also 

494.52 497.11 A: demonstrate kirby vacuums 

496.72 502.47 B: so you kind of you have to um time what you do with some humour to convince people to um 

502.21 504.47 A: yeah yeah and 

503.86 506.30 B: hopefully not objectionable [laughter] 

505.57 507.61 A: right you know you i think its 

507.62 510.66 A: my job or any job when you are dealing with people 

511.21 520.02 A: it's it is again important to have a sense of humour and be able to joke around about things because if you're too serious in your everyday life 

520.56 525.16 A: you know people aren't that people are more comfortable when you're able it joke with them 

524.88 529.02 B: yeah and without being so personal that you offend them in some way 

528.74 532.57 A: right right you have to really know the the line 

532.60 545.13 B: i think maybe to it like if somebody is very very personal they are about politicians and celebrities on on those talk shows at night which is the primary humour that most people get because i don't think that many people go to clubs on a regular basis 

545.03 550.30 B: i mean movies are so studied they're so work to death you know some of these scripts 

550.72 553.51 B: that it's it's more a package it's like a 

553.62 556.61 B: card or something like hallmark card or painting 

557.00 558.25 B: it's just too 

558.26 561.93 B: refined it's it's been hacked to death almost 

562.01 565.99 B: so that the spontaneous thing is maybe on t._v. and i think um 

566.55 569.55 B: what happens there is that there is a real attack 

569.32 570.17 A: yeah 

569.99 573.34 B: a real attack and it's it's um somehow 

574.10 577.48 B: (( not offensive to people and that's what i'm trying to say )) 

577.20 579.86 A: well that's it i mean when when people 

579.88 584.96 A: say this show is offensive it should be taken off the air this and that 

585.16 590.09 A: do you know what and it's true i'm sorry if you don't like a show don't watch it 

590.17 591.15 B: yeah 

590.62 591.83 A: there's um 

591.39 599.89 B: can you imagine if you were trying to sell a vacuum cleaner and you told somebody who's a customer you sure look like you could use a vacuum cleaner i mean you would never say such a thing 

599.52 599.89 A: (( no ))
