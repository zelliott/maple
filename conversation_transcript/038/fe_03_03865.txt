167.94 170.66 B: they're they're not the same anymore you know

187.83 192.68 B: it kind of put debbie into a you know a dark spot 

193.09 198.68 B: making you know of course you know trying to tell them that their lives i think the thing i don't like is 

193.15 194.23 A: mhm 

198.76 203.16 B: why they wait until both of them are deceased to do a movie about themselves 

203.52 207.76 B: why they can't do it when they're around so they can kind of defend themselves 

207.72 208.76 A: mhm 

208.11 209.84 B: just it was 

210.67 211.54 B: (( yeah )) 

211.31 214.06 A: they didn't have such an ideal life 

214.25 225.75 B: well no what is was was you know pretty much behind the scenes it showed it it they did a little clips it showed on how they started how they started every thing 

225.71 234.30 B: like they showed behind the scenes basically um why they're marriage separate why they separated and 

235.79 241.88 B: you know basically that it was all him and you know it just made him look like a bad person 

236.53 237.63 A: mhm 

243.13 244.38 A: well that's something 

244.78 256.69 A: that is really really funny because just looking at at the show i mean i know nothing about the life i would of thought it was all her and he was just like like 

252.80 253.67 B: right 

256.85 260.87 A: you know because in the show it was really her show and he was 

260.31 262.27 B: right well 

262.46 275.73 B: like every every time before they did their show live in front of an audience and every time they started he always emphasizes that he was the president of and show was the vice president 

275.81 289.60 B: and he apparently you know spent a lot of their money on gambling and stuff like that and he he would you know tell her he's one place and be in another place gambling and stuff and 

289.84 297.49 B: when friends tried to gather them together gather them together and kind of help him he just went off the wall 

297.75 298.96 B: it showed them 

297.75 298.96 A: really 

299.15 305.10 B: oh yeah it showed them him uh destroying their beverly hills house because 

305.69 315.87 B: they got a letter of something that they were in debt or something and he just like flipped his lid and started destroying the house and it's like you know this isn't the that i remember you know 

312.85 314.26 A: (( kind of [noise] )) 

316.96 318.78 B: just went a little too far 

318.07 320.37 A: oh that's so tragic 

320.06 321.79 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

321.33 323.71 A: that is so tragic 

323.83 327.23 B: yeah i think that was on um last this past sunday 

326.97 327.98 A: mhm 

327.93 328.84 B: (( and )) 

328.68 337.13 A: and it's interesting that you when your were saying this you know what i was thinking about carole and i think also had a very tragic life 

336.70 337.73 B: (( mhm )) 

337.58 341.61 A: i know her parents were alcoholic and 

340.98 343.02 B: see i don't know much about her 

344.60 348.32 A: and i wonder if like there's a tie between 

348.92 351.86 A: them you know like if you have a tragic life 

351.91 354.42 A: one way to deal with it would be to 

355.05 359.24 A: you know make make life make other people happy 

359.15 361.67 B: yeah oh it's funny um 

362.26 373.85 B: said that she's not really a funny person she just acted on what was given to her i guess the writers wrote and she just acted upon it but that she didn't feel she was funny at all 

373.88 375.21 A: really 

374.99 375.99 B: yeah 

375.30 381.94 A: oh but just her facial expressions did you ever see the one when she was um 

382.33 385.29 A: um she got a job um 

385.71 390.76 A: [noise] with medicine like some you know medicine doctor you know 

389.82 390.93 B: yeah 

390.83 395.76 A: and just the faces she made when she had to eat it in front of the audience 

396.54 398.52 A: it was [noise] really funny 

398.52 401.84 B: yeah apparently um she couldn't act 

402.46 405.04 B: without having people in front of her 

405.43 406.85 A: mhm 

406.27 411.93 B: that um she would go in her dressing like lock herself in her dressing room in for like 

412.09 424.58 B: i don't know she tried five ten different times different ways until she got comfortable enough where she felt she had the way that she wanted but the only way she would act it on the show was to have a live audience 

423.94 425.68 A: oh really 

425.19 432.65 B: yeah they were the first the first company to start the live audience and tape it live 

432.62 433.35 A: mhm 

435.84 443.09 B: and then apparently they bought one of the companies she used to work for production companies and oh it was 

443.10 444.70 B: it was interesting 

445.84 448.56 A: yeah that sounds very interesting [noise] 

449.95 453.68 B: but you just don't have anything like those shows nowadays 

453.12 454.69 A: no they just don't 

454.86 455.71 B: (( mhm )) 

455.72 459.73 A: because they're because they're really not 

460.70 462.70 A: they're really trying to 

463.12 466.30 A: link dirtiness with comedy 

466.30 471.65 B: well and they don't have much comedy they're all into this reality stuff now that you know
