260.44 263.09 B: [noise] 

264.52 274.93 A: and we enjoyed a lot of the come- we went to some comedy places down there and and of course we were there in the middle of the hurricanes so everybody didn't have a lot of things to laugh at [laughter] down there 

273.01 282.31 B: [laughter] right they think yeah [mn] that hurricane parties uh you know they make a big joke over that [laughter] 

281.69 285.00 A: yeah exactly exactly 

283.21 284.34 B: [laughter]

294.38 295.27 A: yeah 

296.18 301.70 A: but i just i just don't see how comedians think that 

302.20 306.76 A: racism et cetera et cetera is funny it's just it's just not 

306.49 308.01 B: right 

307.41 308.70 A: exactly 

308.79 322.28 B: well that's why i was asking if you saw s- uh star search i mean 'cause most of the comedians they they come out with you know the the jokes are ususally they're not racist i i don't find i guess maybe because of live t._v. and 

322.42 325.33 B: [laughter] you know uh family time [mn] 

324.97 326.25 A: oh uh-huh 

326.14 328.74 B: you know children or i i i really 

329.90 336.78 B: [noise] but i do enjoy comedy i'm kinda i don't i'm kinda trying to think of things that we need to say [laughter] 

335.29 343.65 A: ex- exactly me too i mean if i had the choice of like any time i wanna go to a movie or any time i rent a movie first thing i look at is for comedy 

343.27 347.00 B: right what's a good comedy you've sent rec- recently 

344.18 344.94 A: so 

347.42 352.91 A: oh gosh i have to stop and think um i haven't really seen any good ones [laughter] 

351.33 354.61 B: [laughter] 

353.45 362.11 A: they just they just haven't had any really good ones out i know there's a couple of new ones out that i that i the new jim carrey one i keep seeing advertised 

362.08 363.65 B: (( okay i didn't see that one )) 

362.50 370.04 A: bruce almighty that one looks pretty funny and it looks like it you know would be on the line of tasteful comedy the way i call it but 

364.72 365.64 B: (( well i )) 

369.78 372.50 B: right tom hanks is pretty um 

372.70 383.73 B: i find like tasteful as far as i- any movies he plays in that that are you know kind of on the comedy side like big have you seen that movie big um 

380.40 381.34 A: uh-huh 

381.84 383.04 A: yes 

383.05 384.18 A: yeah 

384.13 392.04 B: and i i guess well forrest gump wasn't a comedy but i i laughed at that movie so much it was just some of the things in it 

392.17 394.42 B: it it was really good 

393.80 405.25 A: oh definitely yes i i can't believe it wasn't classified as a comedy either 'cause i really enjoyed that one myself so and the way and he it was tastefully done i think 

404.62 406.14 B: right right 

405.45 411.43 A: you know and the things he made fun of were definitely things in our history that needed to be made fun of [laughter] 

410.61 423.51 B: right [laughter] did you did i'm sure you've are you familiar with jackass the the the show that comes on on m._t._v. 

416.39 417.29 A: so 

423.31 428.68 A: no i've never seen it but my son keeps raving about it he's eighteen 

427.29 434.20 B: [noise] well right well the young one like it but that's the kind of com- to me it's re- it's not even comedy it's not 

428.70 429.55 A: so 

434.15 439.97 B: they do the stupidest things i mean of course that's i guess that's where the name jackass comes from i mean 

439.86 453.23 B: and these kids that enjoy it it just i've seen it before because just flipping the stations and you stop and watch it 'cause it's kinda like i can't believe they are doing these things [laughter] and people watch this 

448.95 451.18 A: [laughter] 

453.30 456.09 A: yeah and it and possibly 

454.53 456.04 B: to me that's very 

456.07 458.21 B: tasteless and just uh 

458.40 462.53 B: it ruins a lot of the things that you don't want your children to think 

462.36 465.04 A: exactly exactly 

464.42 467.47 B: see i have i have a five year old so that is something 

466.59 470.48 A: oh you're just starting [laughter] 

468.32 470.96 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

471.01 478.98 B: with an eighteen year old you can't tell the eighteen year old well look i don't want you to watch this i mean that's that's the humor that they they think is funny but 

478.83 479.80 A: yeah 

478.84 491.03 B: it it's ridiculous i mean they really do some things and i notice probably younger kids that try to do some of these stunts that are so stupid and off the wall and [mn] could hurt themselves 

490.99 496.77 A: oh exactly yes and that's what is worrisome because didn't they have 

496.91 502.04 A: somebody already get hurt 'cause they were trying they tried one of the stunts i think 

499.77 501.14 B: i think 

501.45 505.08 B: i think you're right because um they always put the the big 

505.05 514.32 B: um warning in the front of the you know shows like that the please don't try these at home these are performed by professionals if you wanna call 'em professionals 

514.12 521.63 B: i mean they [laughter] they're making tons of money doing the stupidest things they were doing paper cuts i remember that one i saw 

521.52 534.88 B: i was flipping it and they were putting paper cuts in between their toes [lipsmack] and um with a with a big manila um like type folder envelope um i thought no it's not fun- they just they were 

531.01 533.08 A: oh gosh that's not funny 

533.92 536.04 A: that would hurt yeah 

535.02 543.14 B: and to watch it i told my husband i said i cannot look at that it's it's making my my blood run cold i said turn it off 

542.76 546.02 A: yeah and then how many kids tried to do that i'm sure 

545.54 548.45 B: exa- and hurt themse- right 

546.98 553.79 A: and hurt themselves exactly not realising that it really does hurt paper cuts is one of the worst hurts you can have 

553.21 556.01 B: oh right and they just do um 

556.13 561.30 B: it it like i say it's just it's very tasteless uh it makes me wonder if um 

561.31 564.81 B: they have to medicate themselves [laughter] beforehand if you know what i mean 

563.55 569.55 A: [laughter] oh they'd have to do something you would think exactly 

565.29 566.36 B: yeah 

566.56 570.44 B: [laughter] 

569.56 570.92 A: exactly 

571.14 575.17 A: and i did watch what was it oh my big fat greek wedding i thought that was 

574.00 575.17 B: yes 

575.41 579.84 A: pretty good i did watch that on t._v. not long too long ago and um 

575.42 576.79 B: that was good 

580.00 588.12 A: i don't know if sweet home alabama could be considered a comedy but i thought it as pretty cute and i thought it was very funny in places it was pretty good 

584.05 585.55 B: i didn't see that one 

588.11 599.95 B: but i know my big fat greek wedding i did enjoy that that was it you know that was the type of comedy that well i actually let my little girl watch it and you know she it wasn't something that i felt was tasteless or 

596.25 597.36 A: oh uh-huh
