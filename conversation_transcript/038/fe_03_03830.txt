38.57 48.77 A: it's that they don't really feel like i don't know i don't want to say like racist jokes because that's not really what they are but they'll make jokes that are in bad taste to many other people 

48.29 49.46 B: (( mhm )) 

48.77 55.09 A: but they'll say it you know in in a light hearted way around people who aren't you know going to be offended by it

91.51 92.33 A: [laughter] 

91.70 96.52 B: discuss these kinds of things among themselves and just don't think it would be appropriate to ah 

96.41 97.97 A: (( [sigh] [mn] to have the kids here )) 

96.89 100.46 B: to snigger about such things in uh in in polite company 

100.38 101.30 A: true 

101.45 113.63 A: and i'm not really offended by many things very easily so it's hard for me even personally say when the jokes is in bad taste they could think a joke's not funny but i mean i'm i-i don't draw the line very i 

105.88 106.73 B: [laughter] 

113.89 117.96 A: i don't know i don't usually draw a line period um 

117.37 118.13 B: (( [laughter] ))

120.51 122.74 B: no no who is that 

122.13 132.51 A: he's a comedian who um a lot of people think his jokes are in very bad taste um but ah i think he's very funny and ah you should check him out sometime 

132.18 134.37 B: cou- um could you give me an example 

134.62 137.41 A: ah [laughter] um well he 

135.35 141.70 B: [laughter] [sigh] i know it doesn't always translate well to tell somebody else's jokes but i've i i'm just not familiar with him 

139.05 139.62 A: (( [mn] )) 

141.17 150.36 A: well he'd have like this um this tape of prank phone calls like sort of like the jerky boys but um oh you know a little bit um 

147.65 148.51 B: right 

150.52 154.56 A: more oh i don't know the right word um 

155.02 156.67 B: is it risque or 

155.04 156.31 A: a little poor 

156.44 157.43 A: what 

157.11 159.61 B: is it is it risque or or just 

158.61 161.88 A: um no not really he just ah you know he 

160.61 166.01 B: even even more juvenile i don't know if it's possible to be more juvenile [laughter] than the than the jerky boys 

164.11 165.42 A: yeah it's 

165.53 169.31 A: it's just maybe he's ruder i don't know um 

169.31 184.10 A: he just but it's it's very funny it's you know when you think about it for a second and then when you really think about like the people he's calling and how you know bad they feel then it feels sort of bad liking it but um if you type neal hamburger into a search engine 

183.77 184.70 B: mhm 

184.04 190.32 A: um i'm sure you'll come up with some things and um i think he's very funny but a lot of people don't and ah 

190.67 202.46 A: and i think yeah i think the jerky boys are okay i do- i don't think that they're incredibly funny but you know you get a good laugh but i think some people might think that that's uncalled for um humor but i don't know 

201.29 202.64 B: i don't think that they're 

202.89 210.87 B: i mean i just don't personally i just don't think that they're funny at all i just don't get it but my they have my husband like rolling on the floor laughing [laughter] 

206.48 207.76 A: yeah 

209.86 216.33 A: well you husband might like neal hamburger more [laughter] anyway i think i think that he's much funnier than the jerky boys just 

211.95 214.24 B: [laughter] 

215.57 216.50 B: okay 

216.13 225.32 A: humorwise but i mean it's sort of the same idea of just you know being very juvenile and and making phone calls but 

225.26 232.44 A: um but there's another person who makes prank phone calls using arnold schwarzenegger clips like um from movies 

231.30 238.16 B: you know my my i've heard that my my um my sister who has like the same sense of humor as my husband um 

237.14 238.25 A: (( right )) 

238.31 239.51 A: [laughter] 

238.57 248.83 B: played played played a tape like just played a c._d. for us last time we were up there and i was just sitting there and the two of them [laughter] were like in hysterics [sigh] 

242.94 244.24 A: right 

246.23 247.42 A: [laughter] 

248.47 257.46 A: yeah [sigh] it ah you know i think it's like it's a lit it's i don't find it unfunny i mean i think my boyfriend's the same way he thinks it's much funnier than i do 

257.52 262.48 A: um but you know i don't know i don't know if we're staying on topic here it was humor 

262.89 266.39 A: that draw the [mn] what was the topic humor 

265.54 271.10 B: [laughter] how do you draw the line how do you know when you've crossed the line between 

266.50 270.02 A: (( that crosses the line how do you draw the line )) 

271.29 273.51 B: what's funny and what's in poor taste 

271.36 272.46 A: (( yeah )) 

273.54 284.09 A: yeah i i think that your the first thing you said was definitely the most accurate it's definitely just who you're around and you know you have to have a good feel of the situation 

284.04 293.08 A: you know like making a toast at a wedding or something you know you'd be much more careful with with what you said humorwise because there's so many different 

287.93 288.80 B: [laughter] 

293.15 304.47 A: generations and i think generations are a big thing too like my grandparents certainly wouldn't think the same things are funny that i think are and i wouldn't say a lot of the same jokes around them [laughter] um 

294.61 295.78 B: (( right )) 

302.98 304.17 B: [laughter] 

304.52 309.46 A: so i yeah i it's ah i think it's definitely the company that you're with 

309.77 313.95 B: yeah but it's always so nice to to to realise ah 

309.87 311.41 A: and 

314.09 319.82 B: i don't know like if you're with somebody who you're not you know you're not you're not sure if they're if they would be if they'd find the same things funny 

319.79 320.71 A: right 

320.33 322.53 B: or if you or if you've ah 

322.66 326.47 B: you know just not had the same kind of relationship maybe with somebody who you've just met at work or 

326.42 327.44 A: right 

326.56 332.68 B: um to to realise that you that you that you do have the same warped sense of humor you know 

331.73 334.07 A: yeah that is very rewarding 

333.56 334.94 B: (( yeah one )) 

334.53 336.77 A: [laughter] yeah [laughter] i think that's true 

335.40 336.89 B: of my favorite things 

336.69 349.69 A: sometimes you have to sort of feel people out like you know you have to make a joke that you may you know you're not sure the way they're going to react to it and then based on how they react you can sort of get an idea of what they're like 

339.08 340.21 B: [laughter] 

349.35 350.76 B: right right 

349.80 353.65 A: but then you also take the risk of them not liking it and then you know 

353.75 355.26 A: thinking that you're 

355.29 359.35 A: you know in poor taste or or whatever but yeah sometimes 

359.36 364.20 A: um i know i know many people who who do that who make sort of um 

364.28 374.15 A: you know jokes that a lot of people would find offensive that just you know they don't really mean what they say but they just want to see i guess how easily people get offended 

374.18 387.90 A: you know i'm not really sure how how i don't know i think i would handle it fine if like it was my friends but if a complete stranger like said something like that to me you know i just i wouldn't know you know how to react because you don't know how serious they're being and 

382.12 383.14 B: (( hm )) 

384.12 385.51 B: sure sure 

388.20 393.73 A: so yeah [laughter] i don't know what else to say about the topic it's 

392.92 395.13 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

394.39 395.46 A: um 

395.88 397.21 A: i like humor 

397.17 398.23 B: [laughter] 

397.46 398.94 A: um 

399.20 402.45 A: i don't yeah i don't know um 

402.72 413.23 A: i don't i don't i don't know many comedians who i i except for neal hamburger who i think that would be offensive to other people like you know your dave lettermans jay lenos 

412.51 414.09 B: yeah 

413.28 418.54 A: i think they're pretty i mean even if they make somewhat and even bill marr is a little bit 

414.84 415.95 B: yeah 

418.89 419.90 B: um 

418.98 421.16 A: you know bill marr from politically incorrect 

420.61 425.44 B: um yeah no i don't but [mn] i mean i it seemed like there was there was a lot of ah 

425.48 426.97 B: maybe that's i'm 

427.23 429.71 B: not sure if that's if that was humor but 

429.88 436.91 B: um you know so many people were offended by um you know his remarks on the war which i don't which i didn't 

434.68 435.77 A: right 

437.21 439.78 B: which i didn't get at all i mean i don't 

438.57 441.06 A: no i didn't i didn't get it either 

439.91 442.48 B: why would i don't i didn't understand why that would be 

442.85 445.02 A: yeah people were 

443.69 445.33 B: in bad taste 

445.26 458.93 A: no i think um people were being very patriotic at that point i don't know yeah i mean i didn't understand it 'cause he said something along the lines of like how we're cowards i mean i guess it wasn't meant to be funny it was just meant to be a comment 

450.36 451.78 B: or something [laughter] 

458.94 471.15 A: but how we are cowards because we bombed from really far away and how [mn] the terrorists you know how president bush kept calling them cowards you know even though they did something much more 

471.29 481.75 A: i mean regardless of whether it was good or bad obviously it was very bad but coward may not have been the right word i think that's what he was saying and everyone was all up in arms because you know they 

481.82 482.90 A: they didn't want 

482.97 483.94 A: (( ah )) 

484.15 498.63 A: any- anything to be construed as what the terrorists did has been good so i i don't know i guess that's why people didn't like it but i think i think he's i don't know if he usually tries to be funny or not but i think you know um his humor when he does make it is 

498.89 501.17 A: pretty good and i and i like uh 

501.43 503.58 A: i like the saturday night live humor 

503.87 505.12 B: (( mhm )) 

504.04 506.35 A: i think they're although i didn't realize it's gotten a lot 

506.38 511.31 A: ah worse over the years but ah it used to be i think pretty good 

511.37 516.82 B: yeah i remember um when i was growing up like george carline was the was the epitome of 

511.40 512.42 A: but 

516.63 517.62 A: yeah 

516.89 518.64 B: bad taste you know that was 

519.19 520.48 A: (( [laughter] )) 

520.72 523.74 B: you know like my sister and i would would you know 

520.95 521.93 A: and 

524.12 530.85 B: totally giggle and snort over his over his albums but we couldn't you know god forbid that we let our our parents hear us playing them 

529.75 531.00 A: right 

531.35 533.77 A: that's yeah how old are you

542.72 544.40 B: of course he's been around forever 

544.41 545.46 B: um 

544.67 545.53 A: i think 

545.78 555.69 A: yeah i think the humor in generation gaps are are much bigger you know like the twenty to forty range i think is like people generally i think have the same 

555.82 565.12 A: i don't know i mean maybe twe- between twenty and forty is a little different but when you get a lot older of course a lot younger you don't want to make jokes around younger people because 

565.31 569.66 A: you don't want them to have ah [laughter] yeah 

567.94 576.91 B: [laughter] you know i know i-i teach ah i teach kids um for my day job and and i'm often trying to be really you know really careful about ah 

576.69 577.90 A: right 

577.04 581.26 B: you know [laughter] what you can what you can joke about in front of them but often you know 

578.28 579.14 A: i know 

581.52 586.11 B: they'll volunteer these things that you know i don't know where [laughter] where they get it 

585.39 587.99 A: right [laughter] very funny 

586.68 592.16 B: so they can probably ah you know they probably they probably heard anything that i could i could say to them
