34.38 37.58 A: uh what we i guess what we think about it 

37.70 38.89 B: right 

38.35 42.07 A: the most i can [laughter] what i got out of it it wasn't very 

42.25 43.20 A: uh 

43.31 44.96 A: self explanatory 

45.89 47.02 A: (( but uh )) 

45.90 52.61 B: yeah w- it it's funny that it happens to be comedy my husband and i and a couple of friends went to a 

52.89 56.56 B: a carl hurley show i don't know if you're familiar with carl hurley 

57.39 60.76 B: but he's from kentucky he's a stand up comedian 

57.85 58.70 A: mhm 

60.80 61.71 A: yeah 

61.27 62.36 B: and 

62.79 67.01 B: we really enjoyed it he's absolutely hilarious but you know 

67.07 68.80 B: his comedy is clean 

69.22 72.21 A: yeah i think it makes a big difference when it's 

72.37 83.81 A: i off color i guess is okay if that's what you're going after but i like real comedy i like you know like lucille ball comedy uh eddie murphy comedy 

83.92 88.98 A: um you know like everybody loves raymo- things things that are 

89.21 91.27 A: really um 

91.85 97.88 A: good but when they get on and all they do is they have to use a lot of vulgarity in order to be funny 

98.22 100.20 A: completely turns me off 

100.50 103.36 B: right that that's the same way i feel about it 

104.82 105.64 B: uh 

106.07 119.55 B: but carl hurley i mean that that was just a wonderful it was a wonderful show [noise] and i mean he's hilarious he he takes things that happen in his life and you know real life things and and turns them into comedy [laughter] 

119.64 120.89 A: oh yeah 

121.79 128.69 A: that's well i i guess if you you know when you're in person i think a lot of comedians are a lot more 

128.89 131.05 A: you know you get a lot more out of it 

131.10 139.02 A: than if you just watch it on t._v. or you know go and see it in the movies i think you know in person always has a little bit more 

139.45 146.14 A: enjoyment to it of course i do like all the nutty professor movies and 

146.23 154.71 A: you know i don't like slapstick like airplane and things like that i don't like that because to me people hurting people that's not funny to me [laughter] 

149.79 150.64 B: right 

154.10 155.56 B: no [laughter] 

154.76 156.90 A: i never liked the three stooges either 

157.07 157.99 B: really 

157.91 160.26 A: mm no doesn't 

158.73 162.12 B: no i i don't i've never like that [laughter] 

161.71 163.31 A: no me neither 

163.51 166.05 B: but i really up until 

166.00 180.75 B: i discovered uh carl hurley i i just never was into comedy at all because a lot of it just i had been you know introduced to had been [mn] downright filthy and i don't like watching anything my children can't watch [laughter] 

180.48 183.63 A: right exactly exac- i feel the same way 

184.80 185.74 B: i should 

184.89 186.51 A: that's exactly true 

186.74 198.60 B: and uh you know one of my friends is saying to me all the time i can't believe you don't like comedy because you joke around and you're always happy you seem like the type that'd like comedy and i said well most of it is just downright filthy i just don't like it [laughter] 

186.80 188.00 A: (( but yeah that's true )) 

198.43 211.93 A: well i don't i don't really see anything funny about it i don't y- you know i mean they're just they're things that to me [sigh] i mean you know they go on so you know why do you have to try to elaborate on it [laughter] 

201.14 201.95 B: right 

211.93 213.42 B: (( right [laughter] well )) 

212.01 213.68 A: you know it's just 

214.05 215.19 A: (( i don't know )) 

215.58 219.85 A: it it's funny but i just that's the way i've always felt about it 

220.32 227.69 A: but i like uh i like most comedy if like i said if it's it's just downright just funny 

228.05 236.84 A: like [mn] well the si- the comedians aren't like they were years ago like um sid caesar and but now if they had them on they wouldn't be as funny 

236.78 237.87 B: right 

237.70 240.58 A: you know they aren't they aren't as funny anymore 

238.22 242.08 B: it takes more now to to entertain people [laughter] 

242.13 246.89 A: yeah it's true and i think we've gotten more um 

247.75 253.73 A: i don't know sophisticated so that you know just basic slapstick comedy 

254.04 257.39 A: you know you look at each other and say huh [laughter] 

256.56 259.88 B: [laughter] so stupid it's not funny [laughter]

265.11 267.79 A: (( [lipsmack] i mean he was i think one of the first things i never )) 

267.84 272.10 A: i mean just before he went off the air and i to me it was like oh wow 

272.43 280.78 A: but now i watch his reruns and i just stare at the tube and say gee [laughter] what was so funny about him [laughter]

444.12 445.08 A: mhm 

447.78 450.61 A: yeah it oh yeah i like drama too but 

450.72 454.88 A: i i i think well maybe the the time we're living in right now 

455.48 456.57 A: uh 

457.41 458.45 A: (( um )) 

458.51 460.38 A: [lipsmack] i think you know 

460.49 462.87 A: things are a lot worse 

462.90 467.93 A: you know the the the world is and i think comedy means a lot more to people 

468.09 469.10 B: right 

468.67 470.24 A: you know right now 

470.51 472.15 A: it makes 'em feel better 

472.24 473.90 B: yeah i agree with that 

473.61 476.33 A: yeah it takes you away from all that 

476.39 483.50 A: you know you you can sit there and you can lost in something funny for a while [laughter] i watched that lucille ball special 

483.87 486.09 A: the girl that portrayed her life 

486.24 487.17 B: right 

486.54 488.13 A: did you see that yet 

487.60 489.26 B: yes i did 

488.72 492.75 A: that was very good she was really good uh portraying her 

492.45 494.14 B: yes i thought so too 

493.86 498.65 A: yeah i was really surprised but uh i think it was uh 

498.76 502.42 A: you know it was really worth it because um 

502.48 507.57 A: you need things like that to show you ho- what people go through it isn't all fun and games you 

507.32 508.36 B: right 

508.99 512.65 B: i i guess so when it when it comes down to it you know with 

509.03 509.91 A: (( know )) 

512.95 513.74 B: uh 

513.98 515.00 B: i think 

515.28 519.53 B: i would still choose i love lucy and you know so- a lot of the 

519.57 523.82 B: older comedies over a lot of the new stuff now because 

523.01 526.31 A: that's true that is true i i saw um 

526.76 528.88 A: um what was it 

527.70 529.89 B: i felt the older stuff at least 

528.91 537.50 A: the talent con- the new talent shows on the comedy channels and they just lose me because they just get so raunchy all the time 

532.57 533.42 B: uh-huh 

537.22 538.19 B: right 

538.26 545.08 B: well i feel like the older sh- you know the older shows and everything had more m- they we- they were funny but they had meaning 

545.26 547.91 A: yeah exactly exactly 

546.27 549.29 B: now i mean it's like life has no meaning [laughter] [noise] 

549.40 552.14 A: yeah it's true it it's uh 

552.27 557.26 A: it you know it just loses how much fun you can really have [laughter] 

556.50 558.78 B: right [laughter] 

560.04 561.16 A: (( so )) 

561.24 562.26 A: but 

563.03 567.79 A: well i think they're supposed to tell you at the end of ten minutes we've been on for eleven [laughter] 

566.93 571.15 B: really [laughter] they should be telling us soon 

567.81 569.82 A: yeah [laughter] 

571.22 577.57 A: yeah they should but um i think this is neat you get to meet so many people from all over 

577.35 578.37 B: right 

578.78 584.38 B: yeah i talked with someone yesterday from california and before that virginia

593.29 596.67 A: yeah we talked about sports [laughter] yeah 

594.97 595.96 B: really
