0.60 1.73 A: (( hello )) 

2.32 4.46 B: this is donald michael 

4.57 6.25 A: hi this is larry cole 

6.35 7.55 A: where are you from 

8.06 10.28 B: grant's pass oregon 

10.23 14.00 A: oh [laughter] i'm on the east coast [laughter] i'm in maine 

13.14 14.08 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

15.03 15.96 A: uh 

16.14 20.92 A: i understand that we're supposed to talk about uh where humor crosses the line 

20.75 21.59 B: yes 

22.12 25.67 A: uh do you have strong sentiments about that one way or the other 

25.43 26.33 B: yes 

26.46 28.52 A: okay i'm willing to listen 

29.26 33.33 B: well i think it gets it rather ra- rank at times 

34.33 36.95 B: see i'm seventy five years old 

36.33 37.23 A: uh-huh 

37.48 42.82 B: and uh i can remember you know [mn] they couldn't even say kitty litter 

42.90 43.71 A: uh-huh 

43.55 46.91 B: and now y- you know uh 

47.32 51.94 B: i'm a religious person of course and as a result uh 

52.26 54.01 B: you know uh 

54.30 57.27 B: i don't like the foul language 

57.79 61.45 B: and suggestive language that uh 

62.34 64.22 B: some come across with 

65.71 75.62 A: oh i can understand that certainly uh it seems to me that we've had great regression of of humor in our society and [sigh] the norm 

73.32 74.23 B: right 

76.04 84.99 A: of society seems to have changed in my opinion it seems to have [mn] changed and evolved [mn] downward in recent years [sigh] uh 

76.14 77.29 B: well i think it 

82.58 83.55 B: (( yes )) 

84.00 93.54 B: i think it was a fellow by the name of marshall mcluhan who was a professor of communications at university of toronto in toronto canada 

94.06 105.25 B: thirty five years ago said [laughter] and i mean he described it to a tee as as to what was happening as regards in the media 

105.29 109.07 B: which included television radio and other 

109.38 111.28 B: means of communication 

110.54 123.71 A: yeah i'm glad to hear you say that because i was going to point my finger in that direction a little bit myself [sigh] uh i think it's contributed to the regression at least of language and what is acceptable behavior 

116.11 116.77 B: (( uh-huh )) 

123.61 124.53 B: right 

123.92 128.17 A: and because of that the norm in society has changed and 

127.52 129.19 B: right 

128.59 129.76 A: i think 

130.06 133.29 A: i'm younger than you are i'm fifty three and 

132.96 134.60 B: well you're just a kid 

134.06 140.32 A: ah well [laughter] i like to think so [laughter] but i think 

134.78 136.01 B: [laughter] 

136.98 138.16 B: (( [laughter] well )) 

138.46 143.00 B: my mind my mind uh you know my body i [mn] 

143.11 147.13 B: my mind says oh you're still a kid but my body tells me otherwise 

146.55 151.87 A: well i'm reaching that stage uh slowly myself [sigh] but uh i think 

152.22 157.85 A: our society has become desensitized to some forms of humor because 

155.05 157.00 B: (( right exactly )) 

157.93 165.08 A: it's become more acceptable with the younger generation and uh i know from time to time i happen to work with people whose 

160.36 161.26 B: right 

165.46 167.75 A: vocabulary seems to be 

167.66 168.80 B: [laughter] 

168.03 171.96 A: four four letters you know and they they haven't got much beyond that and 

169.65 170.44 B: right 

171.95 178.37 B: well and and it's not only with the male population it's female pop- population 

171.97 172.55 A: (( [sigh] )) 

175.68 176.62 A: oh no 

178.56 182.93 B: used to be you'd hardly hear 'em use any euphemisms even 

183.51 185.23 B: and now they 

185.95 189.47 B: they don't say it use the darn 

189.50 194.55 B: and heck and stuff i mean they just come out with the damn and hell 

194.86 199.82 B: and they use the name of god in vain and [laughter] 

195.98 197.92 A: yeah it doesn't seem to faze them 

199.50 202.62 A: it doesn't seem to faze them at all and uh 

201.18 201.98 B: no 

202.83 203.95 A: i i 

203.96 211.66 A: i guess i would have to point my finger strongly towards the media as being a contributing factor uh yeah what what's allowable 

208.93 210.32 B: well i think so 

211.91 216.31 A: on sitcoms for instance uh has changed drastically and [sigh] 

213.31 214.26 B: (( yeah )) 

216.33 220.12 A: if you watch a good comedian on t._v. now it is not 

220.66 224.10 A: uh bob hope and red skelton type humor anymore 

223.48 224.27 B: (( no )) 

224.69 230.53 A: it it's much more colorful or off color i guess depending on which view 

224.82 226.03 B: well we 

228.87 229.78 B: yeah 

230.73 234.66 A: you would choose to select for a [laughter] descriptive word 

233.11 234.43 B: right well 

234.90 236.39 B: we uh 

236.65 242.70 B: w- watch t._v. land [laughter] andy griffith do you know way back [laughter] 

242.02 243.76 A: yes right i remember that 

243.30 248.25 B: and uh sanford and son and you know those older 

248.12 248.87 A: right 

248.86 252.34 B: and you don't hear that um language 

250.46 251.44 A: that's right 

252.28 254.22 A: i mean that that was uh 

254.28 257.23 A: and there and there was just as much humor to it 

257.03 260.02 B: (( yeah exactly )) 

258.33 260.46 A: only it was in much better taste 

260.28 262.59 B: exactly i know that uh 

263.09 264.02 B: uh 

266.00 268.76 B: well [mn] slipped my mind here but 

268.89 269.45 B: (( [sigh] )) 

269.64 272.13 B: i had one of those senior moments 

272.03 274.91 A: [laughter] you're entitled to that 

274.48 276.75 B: [laughter] anyhow 

276.92 279.31 B: it it it's just um 

279.73 283.06 B: you know well like with red skelton 

283.77 285.66 B: and uh 

287.22 291.34 B: [lipsmack] those fellows you know they w- they were funny 

291.40 294.08 B: and enjoyable to watch 

293.61 301.30 A: well i used to get the biggest kick out of red skelton because he'd [laughter] get half way through a joke and he'd laugh so hard [sigh] before he could finish it that 

297.67 298.68 B: yeah 

299.20 300.12 B: yeah 

301.13 311.93 A: to me that was the humorous part of the whole thing [laughter] [laughter] i think about that often [sigh] my wife is from indiana so red red skelton was from indiana and uh 

303.47 305.13 B: right uh-huh 

306.50 307.27 B: (( yeah )) 

308.34 309.36 B: oh 

310.85 311.93 B: (( yeah )) 

311.97 313.22 A: so anyway 

312.08 315.00 B: well i'm originally from nebraska so 

314.32 319.33 A: oh okay [sigh] so you're a sort of a mid westerner or a semi mid westerner 

317.21 318.24 B: yeah 

318.64 321.25 B: right 

320.68 326.12 A: well anyway i i think he's probably my favorite comedian of all time and 

325.47 327.67 B: well yeah uh-huh 

326.42 336.02 A: and it wasn't terribly off color i mean [laughter] [laughter] he could stand up in church pretty much and say what he had to say and and it wouldn't be unacceptable and 

329.02 330.05 B: right 

332.30 334.23 B: right yeah 

335.38 337.12 B: that's right 

336.37 340.72 A: [sigh] i don't know too many comedians today that [sigh] would go into church and 

340.04 341.72 B: no uh 

341.56 344.52 A: tell too many of their stories and have it be accepted so 

344.06 346.07 B: right exactly 

347.04 350.40 B: but anyway uh 

350.71 354.95 B: i don't watch t._v. as much as i used to because of that uh 

355.75 359.19 B: i like the documentaries on 

359.37 367.41 B: past history and i guess i what i'm doing i live in i i try to live in the past [laughter] 

366.85 367.82 A: well 

367.99 372.33 A: i certainly can understand that i think there are a lot of things on t._v. that i find 

372.57 379.13 A: [sigh] cross the line i don't know if [mn] the hard part of that for me would be to define the line 

373.94 374.79 B: right 

379.00 380.58 B: that yeah it 

379.83 383.69 A: i i think a line is always difficult to define 

383.54 384.47 B: (( mhm )) 

383.76 395.10 A: but you can tell if something's crossed it [laughter] you can tell if something hasn't [sigh] but every once in a while if something is just kind of on the line and you don't know if it's crossed it or not [sigh] and uh 

386.14 386.97 B: yeah 

393.23 394.36 B: right 

395.56 400.01 A: i guess i guess i'd probably call those fence riding moments [laughter] 

398.99 408.44 B: well i think the networks well you know the networks didn't allow it they'd bleep it and once in a while even now they bleep things and it rather surprises me 

408.64 409.73 B: (( [laughter] )) 

409.17 411.26 A: right but they bleep it a lot less 

411.08 412.09 B: right 

411.48 412.76 A: over time 

412.78 414.09 A: (( and uh )) 

412.81 415.03 B: yeah we kind of 

416.33 417.48 B: oh 

418.29 420.39 B: i do watch david letterman 

421.13 422.65 B: and uh 

422.78 428.85 B: but like i say i don't appreciate uh how far they go at times 

428.78 430.36 A: well i think they overdo it 

430.26 431.25 B: yeah 

430.83 432.52 A: [sigh] the the part that i 

433.14 439.04 A: i guess i would look at that troubles me is exposing our youth to it i mean they 

438.87 439.96 B: yeah 

439.32 443.13 A: they're growing up in a generation now where's that's totally acceptable [sigh] 

441.00 441.96 B: right 

443.38 444.81 A: and 

443.58 444.25 B: (( but )) 

445.10 453.31 B: uh we had children uh they d- they all went to public school and one of the teachers used foul language 

453.59 457.12 B: and he did it you know regularly like and 

455.52 456.63 A: frequently yeah 

457.16 460.12 B: so one time i 

460.75 463.54 B: asked said something to him about it uh 

464.56 467.61 B: and he said well he said uh 

467.81 469.52 B: they hear you know 

470.06 476.46 B: proper language all the time and they're going to get exposed to it sooner or later and so he was going 

476.76 480.35 B: and i said well did you ever say anything about using 

480.36 482.64 B: uh language that di- 

482.66 487.81 B: you know didn't have to be filthy language and he was a public school teacher 

489.25 491.61 A: how did he respond to something like that 

491.72 493.34 B: well he um 

493.93 503.50 B: well i'll tell you what happened [laughter] i went to the school board with it and uh well it was i had a v- an audio tape 

503.58 504.64 B: that 

505.11 507.33 B: uh one of the kids had brought 

508.13 511.09 B: home for school and it was him 

511.88 516.60 B: and i just uh gave it to the school board and i said i don't know how you 

517.23 526.23 B: people feel about this but i don't approve of it and anyway he didn't have a job the next year 

526.94 530.03 B: in other words the school board didn't approve of it either 

529.09 535.48 A: right in other words he crossed the line and it was clearly across the line in their their minds 

531.70 532.52 B: yeah 

532.74 533.56 B: yeah 

535.22 538.96 B: now i know from one section of country to the other 

539.70 540.60 B: you know 

540.96 546.47 B: it might be accepted in parts of the country but uh 

548.14 555.64 B: i guess probably the middle west is in my experience anyway they'd be more conservative let me put it that way 

556.14 557.84 B: (( than uh )) 

556.99 557.98 A: (( [sigh] well )) 

558.28 560.55 A: that that may be you know 

560.58 563.21 A: i guess i would put that perhaps in uh 

563.50 565.59 A: a little bit of a different vein 

565.26 566.38 B: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

565.69 566.68 A: uh 

566.72 569.96 A: my idea is that a public school teacher 

570.15 573.58 A: is a person that should be a role model for others to follow 

572.34 574.71 B: (( exactly exactly mhm )) 

574.10 575.51 A: and 

575.88 581.78 A: if that's the kind of role model that you are establishing in your classroom 

582.25 584.75 A: then you are in essence 

585.29 588.39 A: lowering the standards in that classroom 

587.05 588.68 B: (( yes exactly )) 

588.59 590.97 A: rather than raising the standards and 

590.22 592.25 B: well that's uh 

592.60 594.93 B: that's the thing it's uh 

595.24 597.67 B: i can remember as a kid 

597.73 599.90 B: you know down in the lower grade 

597.73 599.96 A: who do you want your kids to emulate that's what it
