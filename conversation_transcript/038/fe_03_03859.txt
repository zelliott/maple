21.33 24.41 B: i know i was sitting here thinking wow 

23.86 24.84 A: mhm 

24.48 26.60 B: how do you handle that one 

26.75 28.69 B: it's an interesting topic though 

29.00 40.36 A: yeah so where do you draw the line between humour that's acceptable and in bad taste well i i have children 

38.07 39.12 B: well 

40.44 41.66 A: and um 

42.27 45.45 A: they they like to have um 

45.69 48.91 A: i have a seven well eight year old now and um 

49.38 50.91 A: a fourteen year old 

50.79 51.77 B: mhm 

51.52 56.96 A: so of course sort of like to do lots of um kind of bathroom jokes 

56.75 57.90 B: [laughter] 

57.34 58.94 A: bathroom humour 

58.73 59.92 B: oh 

59.87 60.95 A: and uh 

60.03 61.08 B: (( um )) 

61.39 64.32 B: i don't know do do you watch a lot of comedies 

64.65 65.75 A: (( um i )) 

66.57 71.10 A: (( do well you know i watch a lot of t._v. )) 

71.28 72.22 B: mhm 

71.65 73.89 A: but um i was just going to say that 

74.68 77.27 A: you know with that with that young age 

77.24 78.22 B: mhm 

77.45 83.03 A: i don't particularly like it but i don't feel you know particularly offended by it 

83.24 85.72 A: it seems that's an age thing kind of 

83.45 84.60 B: (( yeah i was )) 

86.17 94.91 B: yeah i guess when i think about what's appropriate and not what's not appropriate everything is open for um 

95.01 97.28 B: you know attack and so 

98.15 101.10 B: even even having said that 

101.83 103.37 B: i don't know i guess 

104.67 109.89 B: i'm trying to figure out where the line is really drawn because what as it changed to you know 

109.97 112.30 B: whatever like racial jokes or 

111.89 113.56 A: mhm yeah 

113.36 114.61 B: uh 

114.81 116.77 B: racial jokes or 

116.85 120.39 B: jokes about religion and all that kind of stuff 

121.09 129.88 B: i guess you know there's a line to be drawn there but i'm not exactly sure where it's at because i can kind of think of some um conversations 

129.92 130.92 B: where 

131.21 139.28 B: the discussions might be hell you know but it it's not offensive but then there are some that would be i guess 

139.62 142.64 B: i don't know i mean you think about that some of the 

142.39 143.27 A: yeah 

142.90 145.95 B: well known comedians uh 

146.08 148.93 B: richard pryor or um 

149.38 156.43 B: chris tucker and those sorts who always talk about something that's on the edge and stuff 

155.64 156.82 A: mhm 

156.61 160.17 B: and they their jokes 

160.47 163.75 B: i think could be well at least cris 

164.10 166.28 B: what's his name what did i say 

166.04 167.30 A: (( chris pryor )) 

167.72 176.23 B: richard pryor and um chris rock and those sort of guys they are always having jokes which are you know a little risque and stuff 

170.73 171.76 A: uh-huh 

176.64 178.14 B: and um 

178.56 181.66 B: i don't know i guess it's just a manner in which you 

182.06 183.89 B: do it and 

184.44 186.33 B: (( i don't know i g- um )) 

187.20 188.54 B: i think um 

189.22 192.26 B: i i just i mean i listen to them sometimes 

192.31 195.33 B: and their jokes are funny and they they attack 

195.71 196.44 B: (( um )) 

196.45 202.93 B: they attack gay people they attack black people white people you know and nobody is 

202.36 204.05 A: (( mhm )) 

204.12 206.25 A: i i'm not familiar with 

206.35 214.73 A: those comedians i guess cause i really don't like to watch tv [laughter] so i i i don't know about their humour i 

210.75 211.52 B: (( yep )) 

214.78 216.70 A: guess i um 

218.66 222.71 B: are you familiar with any of the popular comedians out today 

222.19 229.45 A: probably not [laughter] [laughter] probably not so it's a little hard for me the comment i love 

223.99 226.72 B: okay [laughter] yeah 

229.73 230.68 A: (( um )) 

230.13 232.15 B: yeah and even with um 

232.44 236.49 B: you might be familiar with rosie o'donnell are you familiar with her 

236.11 242.32 A: no [laughter] i mean the name sounds familiar i don't wouldn't be able to describe her humour 

242.37 243.29 A: (( um i )) 

243.32 245.74 A: (( i guess i would say )) 

246.00 248.61 A: you know sometimes they the jokes 

248.63 249.63 A: are 

250.13 259.12 A: are genuinely funny and then i think it's a litter harder to draw the line even if it's somewhat offensive or making fun of a group 

259.07 259.87 B: mhm 

259.29 260.32 A: um 

260.57 261.59 A: if it's 

262.07 266.86 A: if it's you know just kind of ridiculing them i mean then that's not even 

267.56 279.67 B: that's not necessarily offensive but i mean it's hard to tell when that where that line is because i'm sitting here thinking and i can remember when somebody once told me a joke about 

268.55 269.47 A: that's 

280.10 284.83 B: what's racial in nature and i was very offended by it you know um 

286.37 287.65 B: and 

287.89 289.91 B: then you know other people are 

289.99 291.39 B: not so 

292.49 295.65 B: i guess it's what your sensitive to 

292.57 293.71 A: yeah 

296.18 297.92 A: mhm 

296.30 296.90 B: (( um )) 

297.98 301.41 A: i i feel quite sensitive to jokes about women 

301.59 307.05 A: and i don't like you know certain kind of language that's used for women and so that 

307.08 307.97 A: i 

308.23 309.43 A: i would 

309.60 316.37 A: i would find that offensive or if my son began to tell jokes like that i would be really um jumping all over him 

316.75 317.81 A: um 

318.02 320.30 B: mhm oh you have two sons or 

319.82 323.01 A: i have two children my son is fourteen 

323.12 325.01 A: and my daughter's eight 

324.82 326.32 B: (( oh okay okay )) 

325.77 339.77 A: so of the eight year old you know if she told me some joke that i felt was you know offensive then it would be you know an explanation [laughter] but with my son i think he he would know [laughter] maybe a different response [laughter] 

339.11 340.68 B: [laughter] right right 

339.95 340.90 A: (( um )) 

341.26 342.98 B: yeah um 

343.06 344.96 B: just trying to think i mean 

345.12 347.12 B: i have never come across 

348.35 349.90 B: you do [laughter] 

349.06 356.38 A: well like my my daughter um got very upset at school because the other kids were saying 

356.63 357.68 A: (( um you )) 

358.69 361.39 A: know doing some like little rhyme you know 

361.38 362.29 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

361.73 370.75 A: we used to say in in elementary school you know japanese mother korean daddy makes a baby and we would hold our eyes differently 

371.31 380.11 A: my daughter has a friend who's chinese and they were doing something like that where they were kind of making fun of oriental eye shape and 

379.51 380.59 B: (( oh )) 

380.04 387.47 A: she told to stop it and she didn't like it because she has a friend who's chinese and her friend would be offended 

387.67 388.59 B: mhm 

387.81 388.90 A: um 

388.98 394.64 A: because they didn't like the way that she told them because he did it in a i think a kind of bossy way 

394.70 401.93 A: but i felt like you know good for you to you know just stand up for her and to to not find that funny 

401.62 404.35 B: right that is good that's uh 

402.15 403.03 A: (( well )) 

404.54 407.24 B: she has compassion at an early age 

408.04 412.80 A: she she does and she's aware of what's going on she 

413.50 420.07 A: she has a friend who is chinese and that's very clear and she doesn't she doesn't find it funny 

420.60 421.63 A: (( um )) 

422.80 427.50 A: so that's a kind where even when the kids are telling it i would 

427.98 430.29 A: um you know stop it and 

430.46 433.55 A: say you know i don't want to hear this 

433.99 434.88 B: yeah 

434.19 435.99 A: i think about what you're saying 

435.95 441.60 B: my my child is only uh fifteen months so i really yeah [laughter] haven't 

439.86 441.17 A: oh [laughter] 

441.72 443.88 B: (( been exposed just yet )) 

443.28 449.26 A: right you know a sense of humour that is something that happens [laughter] 

448.95 459.05 B: i mean i was thinking you know i'm thinking wow hundreds of people sitting in front of you know a stage with a stand up comedian and you know that was funny 

459.11 471.03 B: and what's not funny and i think as i think about it now if i was sitting in an audience like that and you know they do a lot of heckling i find that offensive when they they um 

469.01 470.00 A: (( mhm )) 

471.06 471.86 B: they 

472.05 474.44 B: (( audience pick somebody out and they'll )) 

474.93 479.05 B: start talking about their clothes or you know the weight or whatever 

478.83 479.96 A: oh 

479.68 483.98 B: and um that has happened you know i have gone to one or two 

484.31 487.87 B: um comedian shows that offensive 

485.59 486.80 A: mhm 

487.71 488.94 A: mhm 

488.67 495.35 B: so most people don't like to sit in the front [laughter] cause you never know when you know you're going to get attacked 

491.90 493.22 A: no 

495.09 497.14 A: oh yeah i don't like that 

497.07 500.48 B: yeah so um 

501.34 503.88 B: but everything else i mean you know 

504.05 505.75 B: depending i guess 

506.15 509.46 A: my children like to watch the simpsons 

509.05 511.84 B: oh no see i don't watch that i don't like that 

511.33 512.57 A: and um 

512.49 513.53 B: (( [laughter] )) 

512.63 520.74 A: they they it's strange it's the one show that they both like although i think it's kind of over the head of my daughter 

520.54 521.58 B: mhm 

521.15 522.21 A: um 

522.10 524.37 B: she just likes it cause of the cartoons 

524.31 532.24 A: well yeah i think she doesn't quite get it but i mean sometimes i think it's pretty funny [laughter] even though i 

532.28 535.95 A: don't i don't watch it as much as they do so i 

536.20 540.08 A: don't quite know what i like watching that's the other thing about um 

540.13 541.39 A: do you remember 

542.22 543.36 B: mhm 

542.78 544.53 A: when he was on t._v. 

544.26 545.50 B: yeah 

544.61 545.80 A: um 

546.35 550.84 A: now they would it was kind of he would say things that were 

550.77 551.93 B: mhm 

551.09 553.59 A: offensive but 

553.65 559.88 A: the whole show was kind of kind of making fun of the of bigotry 

559.67 560.91 B: (( yep )) 

560.31 564.06 A: so underneath that it was 

564.12 568.53 A: it was kind of funny to see that being charactered 

568.28 570.74 B: yeah i mean i was actually 

571.09 576.85 B: pretty young then and i really don't remember watching it i remember the show
