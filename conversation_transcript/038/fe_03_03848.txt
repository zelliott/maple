1.62 3.74 B: um hi this is gretchen 

3.63 4.87 A: hi gretchen 

4.76 6.90 B: have you done any of these before 

6.40 8.46 A: no this is my very first one 

7.70 12.14 B: oh me too so i was hoping you would know what what we're supposed to do 

8.58 11.42 A: oh wonderful [laughter] 

12.65 14.08 A: mm okay 

13.22 18.05 B: does it matter what i mean does it really matter what topic we talk about 

17.48 20.69 A: i think i think we're supposed to stick to whatever 

20.14 21.84 B: the top- to comedy 

20.56 33.17 A: at least something close to what they had asked about which i'm you know i'm not really clear on i don't have a huge problem with jokes unless they're i guess what they're asking is what makes something in bad taste 

22.82 24.24 B: all righty 

32.91 34.44 B: right right 

34.12 40.67 A: and not i don't know for th- for that for me that would be anything extremely derogatory toward a 

40.70 42.28 A: a race not 

42.17 55.88 A: not that much so f- so much as a you know a blond joke or [laughter] you know oh a man joke or a woman joke does not bother me but whenever you you know throw something else into it that gets me a little bit upset 

46.68 47.87 B: right 

55.57 58.37 B: well maybe it's sort of like if it's a majority 

58.97 63.05 B: (( target do you know what i mean like jokes about )) 

63.17 65.06 B: powerful straight white men 

64.63 66.09 A: mhm 

65.18 70.01 B: aren't necessari- you know the- they tend to not be as offensive as a minority group 

69.37 70.71 A: exactly 

70.54 73.17 B: so i think that's it 

71.08 81.66 A: yeah minor- minority groups are really disturbing or you know if it's a specific joke on of a religious overtone that you know that it was against jewish people or 

78.95 80.02 B: mhm 

81.39 82.62 B: mhm 

81.79 86.78 A: to- to make fun of something that's within their customs or something that they're used to doing then 

87.00 88.40 A: that's disturbing 

88.24 89.33 B: mhm 

89.01 99.43 A: but i never really you know really thought about it i think you just come across things and you hear them and either they hit you as being funny or they just hit you as being disgusting 

99.19 100.41 B: mhm 

99.59 111.52 A: there's you know i don't really think about it before if someone says i have a good blond joke i never get turned off by that but if somebody was 'cause i am a blond [laughter] but if somebody would say you know i have a great joke about black people 

105.00 106.19 B: right right 

107.83 108.64 B: right 

111.40 112.42 B: right 

111.41 115.31 A: i don't really think that i would say oh sure let me let me hear it 

115.00 118.09 B: [sigh] do you read vanity fair magazine 

117.63 118.79 A: no i don't 

118.68 122.83 B: um well there was a big hubbub recently do you know who dame edna 

123.09 124.02 B: is 

124.29 132.20 B: ah the the guy who is dame edna has a column i guess has a column i don't know it's ongoing or if it was just a one time thing 

129.88 131.95 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

132.52 133.94 B: but um 

134.40 136.07 B: you know dame edna's 

136.52 138.53 B: a character who is 

137.35 139.15 A: right 

138.64 143.44 B: offensive you know like says things that are kind of stupidly or something 

142.39 143.81 A: mhm 

143.82 147.39 B: and um in one of the columns 

147.68 156.58 B: you know it was it was obviously a plant kind of question like the reader wrote in to say you know i'm thinking i want to pick up another language 

156.62 160.09 B: and i'm leaning toward spanish what do you think of that 

159.73 160.98 A: oh okay 

160.67 163.30 B: and so dame edna's answer 

161.96 164.52 A: expecting her to go off on that 

164.25 166.40 B: pardon you heard someone go off on it 

165.76 168.28 A: no i said expec- they were expecting her 

168.18 174.15 B: well they should have been expecting i mean i guess the reader i- i was certainly expecting her to say something 

169.41 171.51 A: mhm 

174.20 185.94 B: that was funny because dame edna's ignorant you know what i mean so that's exactly what happened and dame edna said oh you know the only reason to learn spanish is if you want to learn to talk to the help 

177.04 178.84 A: right 

185.84 187.18 A: (( oh )) 

187.53 188.52 B: which 

189.28 192.98 B: if like if if i said that just like a regular person 

192.24 194.52 A: mhm 

193.06 197.84 B: it would be one thing but here's this grotesque of a character 

197.23 198.81 A: right 

198.16 199.53 B: saying it 

199.60 200.95 B: and 

201.43 205.54 B: that initiated a huge letter writing campaign 

205.86 207.38 B: cross country 

207.61 210.05 B: um you know to 

209.76 211.85 A: against vanity fair for p- 

210.32 216.48 B: get the magazine t- yes to get vanity fair to make her retract her statements and 

212.90 215.13 A: (( yeah )) 

216.48 229.39 B: you know like educate themselves about you know racial stereotyping and and it just struck me as really beside the point [laughter] you know what i mean like especially when there's people like you know 

226.14 227.64 A: exactly 

230.04 235.83 B: george bush and policy makers making a huge difference in the lives of minority people 

231.19 233.24 A: mhm 

234.98 239.37 A: mhm 

236.26 239.85 B: and we're going to focus all of our energy on 

240.92 243.34 B: you know a comedic character 

243.82 245.51 A: (( yeah that is strange )) 

243.88 246.95 B: that's comedic partly because she is ignorant like it just 

247.15 250.50 B: it was really kind of surprising to me to see how people 

252.23 255.02 B: you know were really really upset by that 

252.81 254.27 A: yeah 

254.99 257.88 A: and i think it's interesting too when 

258.42 262.69 A: if you know if you're a a white woman like i'm a white female 

262.40 263.36 B: mhm 

262.53 276.98 A: it's non off- it it bothers me whenever i hear jokes that are too much toward you know against a black person whether it's man woman child whatever but just the derogatory comments but it doesn't bother me whenever i see a black comedian 

271.04 272.16 B: mhm 

277.23 279.76 A: do that to black or white 

279.56 280.59 B: mhm 

280.15 293.35 A: and i don't know why that is but you know if i see chris rock on t._v. and he's doing some sort of presentation you know those to me some of them are a little bit out there but some of them you it's just like it's it's expected of them 

289.60 290.62 B: mhm 

293.66 295.58 A: you know they don't they k- 

294.50 298.73 B: th- that they're poking fun at white people or they're poking fun at black people 

297.67 303.94 A: they're poking fun at both i think he's something someone like him he tends to poke fun at both 

299.28 300.28 B: mhm 

304.18 305.47 A: groups 

305.04 305.83 B: (( mm )) 

305.50 312.31 A: where if you had a white comedian up there and they started poking fun at blacks i think there'd be a huge overthrow 

311.48 312.85 B: yeah 

312.32 318.56 A: to to have them be squelched in what they wanted to say but the other way seems to work just fine 

315.87 316.87 B: right 

318.63 322.38 B: well maybe it's like about authority like we trust that he 

323.64 327.67 B: you know knows more and knows different things than we do as white people 

325.86 333.58 A: mhm maybe he just has you know an insight into things and knows how far he can go to push the button without 

333.60 335.78 A: getting his own group upset at him 

335.59 336.50 B: uh-huh 

336.10 341.68 A: you know he knows exactly where to stop before before all of a sudden he's not popular any more 

338.65 339.77 B: right 

341.50 342.55 B: right 

341.82 346.62 A: you know i'm sure that's an experience you get around to doing if you do that sort of thing for a living 

347.18 351.62 B: but you know there's also been ah who's the fellow 

351.93 355.50 B: he's married oh mel brooks 

356.51 357.69 B: um 

359.09 368.74 B: i wish i could remember the exact instance but i know that he got in big trouble with other jewish people who were offended at some of his jewish jokes 

360.92 364.39 A: (( mhm )) 

368.14 370.11 A: mhm 

369.28 373.37 B: and he's jewish so you'd think you know he would be allowed to 

370.17 371.47 A: right 

371.71 373.25 A: right 

373.56 382.39 B: say whatever he wanted to but you know i know thi- this is like in the eighties he said something or another that just like crossed the line and 

382.69 385.79 B: and ah got a lot of trouble for it 

385.70 396.04 A: yeah it's amazing how some people can speak up and say whatever they want to say and nothing ever comes of it and then somebody else can turn around and say something that seems to be very much along the same lines 

390.51 391.60 B: uh-huh 

395.79 396.71 B: right 

395.89 404.36 A: as what the first one said and they're just blackballed or it's you know it's talked about for months and months and months afterwards do you remember when they said that [laughter] you know 

398.78 400.16 B: (( right )) 

403.83 404.80 B: right 

404.26 412.19 A: and you know everyone says things that they didn't really mean to say or that didn't come out the way they wanted to say it or they wished they could take it back later 

411.93 412.94 B: right 

412.21 416.37 A: i think it's just you know obviously a lot of people aren't in the public spotlight whenever they do it 

416.33 417.37 B: right 

418.20 420.52 B: so then like thank god they don't all 

421.33 425.60 B: watch every word they say or it would be really boring you know 

423.95 425.59 A: [laughter] exactly 

427.79 435.45 A: that's true yeah i hadn't really extensively thought about it 'cause it's it's just a strange thing they give you a topic and that you're just supposed to like okay let's go 

435.31 437.24 B: right blah blah blah blah blah 

435.75 442.56 A: and to form you know form an opinion on something right on the spot but i guess that's probably what they're looking for is 

442.64 444.42 A: element of surprise 

444.13 445.33 B: maybe 

445.98 446.77 B: (( i don't )) 

446.96 449.80 B: i thought it was about voice recognition the 

450.29 453.33 B: experiment but i might i might be wrong about that 

453.27 461.68 A: i'm not sure i know i thought i had thought seen something or read something that it was how people interact on the phone or something so it could be something with voice recognition or 

459.15 460.18 B: (( mhm )) 

462.48 465.12 A: maybe comfort levels who knows 

464.35 465.93 B: mhm 

465.20 468.12 A: but i'm supposing at some point they'll just tell us we're done 

467.65 470.87 B: [sigh] you were mentioning uh blond jokes 

470.22 471.65 A: (( yeah )) 

471.15 474.29 B: and one year for christmas my cousin 

474.43 476.32 B: printed out for me 

476.83 479.52 B: dozens and dozens of blond jokes 

478.81 480.86 A: mhm 

479.57 481.71 B: and i thought it was the funniest thing 

481.10 482.18 A: [laughter] 

482.22 484.30 B: like i totally enjoyed it [laughter] 

484.95 486.89 A: some of 'em are wonderful 

486.38 493.64 B: ((  )) 

490.14 491.31 A: yes 

493.54 499.42 A: [laughter] now my son i have a son at high school and he enjoys whenever he learns a good one he'll go i heard a good blond joke today 

497.96 499.08 B: (( do something stupid )) 

499.52 500.49 B: (( at work [laughter] )) 

500.05 511.32 A: (( i can turn around and throw my blond- my blondness back out and relate it to whatever joke i had heard )) 

504.59 505.63 B: right 

511.05 512.18 B: right 

512.97 514.08 B: um 

515.78 517.75 B: i don't know what else to say 

517.07 520.27 A: i don't know either this is a very strange thing 

519.95 520.90 B: (( i know )) 

520.38 532.35 A: guess i thought it would be kind of different i've done phone surveys before but i never had to do a phone survey where it was just primarily talking without somebody asking me questions and i had to plug something into a category somewhere 

528.07 529.00 B: right 

532.01 533.73 B: right i didn't either 

533.90 536.13 B: i've never not not done this either 

536.65 537.82 B: um 

537.17 537.73 A: (( mm )) 

540.61 543.83 A: trying to think of any other sort of jokes that would be 

544.13 546.46 A: you know offensive to me 

547.22 549.47 A: or something that would be along that line 

549.29 552.34 B: well i don't like mean spirited jokes 

551.95 553.07 A: mhm 

552.56 554.27 B: you know like when someone 

554.67 557.15 B: like marg- do you watch margaret cho ever 

557.22 558.22 A: no 

558.35 561.08 B: um she sometimes does 

560.45 564.53 A: oh margaret cho okay yes yes she used to have a television show years ago 

561.53 564.12 B: (( yeah like standup kind of stuff )) 

564.25 566.15 B: right yes all those years ago 

564.77 565.92 A: mhm 

566.21 569.21 B: and a big part of her act is her family 

568.61 570.36 A: mhm 

570.30 574.03 B: but she has a way of talking about her family without 

573.59 574.15 A: (( [mn] )) 

574.05 585.28 B: like like you sort of know that she loves her mother even though she's including material about her mother like there's maybe it's like there's a point in hr act where 

579.87 581.84 A: mhm 

586.16 592.00 B: you know she reveals something that lets you know like oh it's okay she doesn't really she's not really talking 

592.50 594.50 B: hatefully about her mother 

593.39 594.55 A: mhm 

594.73 598.83 B: it's just sort of she knows her and she can notice these things 

598.85 599.89 A: and she'll do things
