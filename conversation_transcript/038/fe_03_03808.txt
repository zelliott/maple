47.13 48.18 B: right 

53.90 54.68 B: yeah 

56.10 60.49 A: you know for the comedians today they're so even you know 

60.32 68.22 A: the last what twenty years i don't know i mean i'm young but i know that [sigh] you know i've been i know what they say now compared to what 

65.67 66.48 B: (( [noise] )) 

68.03 76.40 A: some of 'em have said in fut- in the past and they can be just as funny without being tacky and you know offensive and gruesome or 

73.75 74.66 B: right 

76.65 78.65 A: you know over the line like 

78.72 82.81 A: sexually explicit and all that stuff you know and using bad language and all that 

82.77 88.43 B: that yeah that that's i agree that i'm a i'm a police officer and i just came out of a meeting where we uh 

88.46 90.75 B: we had to go over last month's case 

90.86 92.18 B: and the first 

92.43 104.04 B: item is a is the sexual crimes and uh the person in charge of the meeting today goes [lipsmack] okay the first is rape uh i wasn't raped were you raped anybody here raped oh i guess we can go to the next section 

104.29 105.35 A: yeah 

104.33 108.85 B: and i was so offended but i couldn't walk out because i don't have enough rank to walk out of a meeting 

108.51 109.63 A: yeah 

109.55 110.93 B: (( you know um )) 

110.52 113.60 A: and that was like a police officer conducting it or 

113.02 114.40 B: yes yes 

113.64 114.41 A: oh 

114.65 118.58 B: a male obviously i think you know male humor and female humor is 

115.83 116.87 A: yeah 

118.66 122.54 B: very different [noise] um [noise] i think i think 

119.48 120.80 A: yeah 

121.12 132.51 A: well i've noticed before like when people laugh it's either out of just you know basically surprise you know when somebody says something just amazingly 

130.54 131.42 B: mhm 

132.54 138.20 A: you know distasteful or something a lot of people laugh because they don't know what else to do you know 

138.32 152.54 A: it's kind of like uh i don't know there's a term for that but i can't remember what it's called but i know that um you know and then people think that they're funny and so they just keep on with that kind of you know topic or or that kind of uh humor 

138.40 139.74 B: (( yeah i understand right )) 

152.67 164.68 A: but um i think the funniest things are just you know things that people [noise] almost everybody experiences every day you know that everybody can laugh at not just a certain amount of people 

164.83 166.71 B: i'm a g. rated person 

166.57 168.34 A: yeah [laughter] 

166.84 172.65 B: uh i've been a i can crack up over over the baby making faces when she didn't 

171.92 179.21 A: yeah [laughter] i like witty humor i think you know when somebody when you use word plays and uh 

172.93 173.84 B: (( realize it )) 

174.82 175.53 B: yeah 

179.30 181.61 A: (( you know that kind of stuff of course i )) 

180.72 181.91 B: bill cosby 

181.69 183.36 A: yeah exactly 

183.28 184.23 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

183.67 186.61 A: or like um i kinda like jim carrey too just the 

186.88 192.14 A: silly face sort of humor you know and physical comedy i think that's funny too 

192.05 193.32 B: (( yeah it is )) 

192.44 195.00 A: and there's nothing wrong with that in my opinion you know 

195.18 205.34 B: no i don't i i actually the timing of it is i'm a frustrated comedian i i i do a lot of stuff not on stage but in in a formal gathering and uh [mn] 

206.13 213.36 B: i watch you know you're watching and if you see somebody frowning at one joke you watch to see if they frown at the next one to see if maybe you are touching you know 

213.67 218.06 B: embarrassing somebody but i love i love like you say physical humor and stuff like that 

217.23 219.48 A: yeah and so you're a comedian then 

219.80 222.77 B: no i i'm a frustrated comedian 

222.41 225.99 A: oh [laughter] what exactly does that mean i heard you ter- use it 

223.02 224.88 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

224.95 228.58 B: well it means it means i don't have the courage to go on stage and get paid for it 

227.30 228.19 A: (( oh )) 

228.55 240.10 B: so any time there's a group you know and i do a lot of public speaking for the police department for for agencies and i always you know throw in situational humor for whatever class i'm teaching or something like that 

228.64 229.66 A: yeah 

237.62 238.63 A: yeah 

239.51 242.32 A: and how do you come up with your contents 

242.21 245.00 B: real life [laughter] 

243.46 245.91 A: [laughter] yeah 

245.21 254.68 B: you know uh uh you know somebody i've arrested will do something funny and and i will make sure you know you tell it so that nobody knows who it is so you're not embarrassing anybody you 

254.04 255.33 A: yeah 

255.08 256.40 B: know which is i mean 

256.61 264.95 B: i do not think you should do humor at the expense of anybody you know not not to embarrass anybody with it be the person you're talking about or the person you're talking too 

259.89 261.07 A: right 

265.42 266.21 B: so 

265.71 266.83 A: yeah 

266.86 272.47 A: i think people just assume that everybody thinks certain things are funny these days you know 

272.01 273.34 B: mhm 

272.49 279.44 A: and so and of course you know in the comedy club or something i've never been to one but i've seen you know them on t._v. and things but 

277.41 278.38 B: (( [noise] )) 

278.94 280.11 B: mhm 

279.46 283.95 A: i guess most people in there would probably laugh at stuff but 

284.28 292.88 A: you know i just i can sit there at these comedians and watch 'em and not even crack a smile and i wonder how in the world they get on t._v. you know 

293.56 294.45 A: so 

293.57 304.92 B: well i i think you have to i don't drink so you know and i don't i don't cuss so i guess that lets me out of a lot of things that people think are funny and i think from watching the ones on t._v. um 

300.19 301.61 A: [laughter] yeah 

305.15 308.76 B: you have to be drunk to think a lot of things are funny you know 

307.41 314.71 A: i know i mean i don't even think jerry seinfeld is that funny but i just and so you know when i would watch his show i mean the show's entertaining 

314.65 323.62 A: in a weird sort of way i guess but um him as a comedian i don't i don't think is funny at all i can sit there and watch him and not smile at all you know i just don't 

320.98 321.73 B: (( yeah )) 

322.84 323.70 B: me too 

323.64 329.27 A: and i kinda wonder how how those people get so you know so famous [laughter] from that 

323.76 325.48 B: whereas the bob hope 

329.26 332.68 B: yeah 'cause obviously he did well you know he did 

331.46 332.72 A: yeah 

332.95 337.57 B: now i'm more the long of the as as far as well known bob hope and 

337.61 340.70 B: red skelton was always my favorite because he keeps 

339.01 351.46 A: that's what my grandmother always tells me [laughter] jeeze i've never seen him i think i my oh i think might know who he is but i don't think i've ever watched his him work so but she's always telling me that she likes him a lot 

341.08 343.75 B: (( [laughter] yes i'm not quite as old as your grandmother )) 

346.83 348.51 B: (( mhm [mn] but )) 

352.14 359.41 B: situational i mean a family things that happen in your family i think is a whole lot funnier than somebody sitting down and making up a joke 

359.29 361.85 A: yeah like inside humor or something 

361.65 369.04 B: yeah yeah if a family member's telling something that happened to another family member and everybody it it's in a loving happy situation you laugh 

362.11 363.11 A: uh-huh 

368.73 369.79 A: yeah 

368.99 379.01 B: you know but like somebody comes to work and they'll they'll tell you something their wife or you know their husband did or their children did and it's very embarrassing or you know or or rough or something 

379.00 386.38 B: i just stare at 'em and most of 'em at least where i work now they they know you know uh you might not wanna enjoy this you won't enjoy this joke you know 

386.48 391.19 B: and i'll leave you know and they they will wait for me to leave knowing that they're gonna tell an offensive joke 

386.62 387.62 A: yeah 

391.32 394.82 B: [noise] you know which is nice it means they have enough respect for me to not to 

395.44 396.42 B: not do 

395.56 403.49 A: well that's good i remember yeah when i was in school you know i am i guess the class clown would try to make everybody laugh but i just 

396.90 397.82 B: (( yeah )) 

403.65 412.84 A: half the time i didn't even find it entertaining at all [laughter] so and i didn't you know i saw everybody else laughing because i think they expected that they were supposed to but i just 

406.25 407.36 B: yeah 

412.87 415.56 A: you know i just didn't really fall for it so 

415.25 416.94 B: (( yes [noise] so )) 

416.97 420.70 B: yeah a- adult humor is what they call it but to me adult humor is 

421.15 424.32 B: it takes intelligence to to understand 

424.34 426.67 B: the uh the jokes and 

426.01 427.19 A: yeah 

426.77 433.32 B: you know either it's literary or something like that i like um british humor i watch a lot of the british comedy t._v. shows 

432.85 434.17 A: oh yeah 

433.57 441.29 B: um because it that's real dry sense of humor and you have to think about it and you know you're using your brain that 

440.27 442.44 A: it's probably a little more witty than 

442.48 443.63 B: i think so 

442.88 444.84 A: what we used to over here 

444.69 445.66 B: mhm 

445.74 448.03 A: my mom's from england so i 

447.50 448.35 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

448.28 452.34 A: i think it'd probably be a little easier for me to understand [laughter] than most people i don't know 

451.29 452.15 B: yeah 

452.38 457.25 B: yeah well my dad was over there for we were there for one year my dad stayed there for like about fifteen years 

452.53 453.85 A: just the way they talk 

456.84 457.94 A: oh 

457.35 461.43 B: and you know you have to use your brain to understand 'em and 

461.73 466.06 B: i don't know but maybe that's an ego trip it took a brain surgeon why you know [laughter] 

463.35 464.85 A: (( yeah i've seen )) 

465.62 472.66 A: i think kinda you know when you're putting two and two together is what's funny you know and you kinda make connections with things i think that's 

473.01 474.82 A: funnier than you know 

475.40 478.40 A: just making obscene jokes and things i don't think 

475.50 476.41 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

477.78 478.64 B: (( mhm )) 

478.90 481.48 B: now my father does a lot of humor by uh 

481.83 483.60 B: words he uses 

484.04 488.09 B: normal everyday language we're from we're down here in the south and we talk a lot of 

488.04 488.95 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

488.34 491.37 B: you know like different from up north but he will use 

491.54 494.27 B: we say twenty five cents words um 

493.71 494.59 A: mhm 

494.33 503.16 B: when he when i was little he said if you're if you're bad he yelled at me if you're bad i'm gonna defenestrate you right now i thought he was gonna cut my leg off or something 

500.37 501.47 A: [laughter] he's 

503.14 505.22 A: what did he say i'm gonna what you 

503.24 504.14 B: and so 

505.07 512.75 B: (( defenestrate d. e. f. i. n. e. s. t. r. a. t. e. or something like that it means to throw through the window )) 

509.54 511.62 A: oh i've never heard of that word before 

512.38 514.76 A: [laughter] 

513.86 516.76 B: and um but he wouldn't tell me what it meant 

516.59 518.51 A: oh [laughter] 

517.04 521.19 B: but the other people that that were there at the time understood the word and they went 

521.29 532.32 B: do it do it and he you know he picked me up and i thought oh dear what's he gonna do and he he swung me you know i was like ten or eleven and i thought it was neat except i was scared at the same time but then i had to go to the dictionary and look it up 

526.10 527.24 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

531.69 533.59 A: [laughter] 

532.83 542.73 B: so then i'd say daddy daddy tell patty you're gonna do that daddy daddy tell my cousin you're gonna do that and they said what does that mean oh i know and i'm younger than you you know so you know 

541.40 543.42 A: [laughter] 

542.79 545.83 B: i like things like that where you have to think 

545.24 547.48 A: yeah 

547.15 554.71 B: but then again i have two grandchildren and all they have to do is smile and i laugh so and that's not even comedy but 

551.96 553.68 A: [laughter] yeah 

554.02 555.23 A: yeah 

555.74 557.27 A: (( i don't know really what )) 

555.79 556.52 B: but 

557.36 563.98 A: what is considered comedy you know i guess it's to make people laugh is that the whole point or is it to you know 

564.36 565.57 B: i guess so 

564.37 567.01 A: to make jokes or what you know 

566.24 570.92 B: yeah you i i don't think it's just jokes because 

568.39 570.32 A: i guess there's too many different kinds 

571.01 572.85 B: jokes can be a um 

573.66 575.90 B: (( not a well yeah jokes can be obscene )) 

575.92 579.77 B: jokes can be what was the original concept of this thing 

580.39 581.47 A: a what 

581.28 584.58 B: what the original concept concept of our subject again 

584.32 587.24 A: um where you draw the line on 

585.41 586.21 B: oh 

586.64 599.07 B: where you draw the line yeah you know a joke it's easy to say when a joke is gonna draw the line because you can say i don't wanna hear about you know anything dirty or words or something like that but actions like you like jim carrey i find 

587.70 588.44 A: on 

599.13 599.95 B: everything
