0.39 2.31 B: um hi i'm lisa 

2.00 3.55 A: hi i'm becka 

3.32 4.85 B: hi becka how are you 

4.43 5.56 A: good how are you 

5.12 11.96 B: i'm fine thanks well that was not what i expected when they said that the topic was going to be comedy but um so what do you think 

13.17 14.10 A: um 

14.50 21.90 A: i think it all depends i think um when things get sexual or about i think about anything like that i think it gets out of hand 

21.42 26.77 B: well that's true and when it gets well what i call i guess bathroom humour 

26.38 27.56 A: oh yeah 

27.04 28.97 B: especially like 

29.20 33.57 B: movies that are directed towards teenagers are really bad about that kind of thing 

32.16 33.50 A: oh definitely 

34.66 36.37 B: like the old um 

36.79 42.27 B: maybe dating myself but the old porky's movies and those kinds of things 

42.05 44.12 A: to be honest i haven't even seen those 

43.76 52.55 B: really [laughter] well you weren't missing much you weren't missing much but i mean what do you think is an example of um when it crosses the line 

45.84 47.54 A: [laughter] good good 

53.72 54.90 A: um 

54.79 58.14 B: like a movie or television show or 

57.33 61.65 A: i think a lot of the n- like the newer movies like like uh for example 

62.34 67.23 A: what is it newest ones like just another teen movie or what ever that one's called 

66.78 70.07 B: i'm sorry just another i i apologize i couldn't hear you 

70.06 72.87 A: ah well one is american pie but there's another one 

72.31 73.97 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

73.16 77.72 A: i think it's just another teen movie or something or not another teen movie 

77.24 78.24 B: okay 

77.89 79.63 A: and they're a lot in there too 

79.69 87.37 B: yeah i haven't seen that but i i was actually pretty shocked um with the american pie movie especially because i heard that it was really good 

87.16 88.07 A: yeah 

87.44 92.86 B: and um while it's not a movie that i would normally turn to watch myself i turned it 

92.95 96.95 B: i was flipping through the channels and it was on h._b._o. or one of those 

97.01 104.23 B: things and and there it was and the big scene with the guy with the pie on the table yeah that that that was definitely crossing the line 

100.41 101.52 A: oh right 

104.12 105.67 A: well i would agree [laughter] 

105.06 109.94 B: [laughter] boy it's hard to talk about these things for ten minutes 

109.92 111.00 A: oh i know 

110.73 121.19 B: um hm well let's see i know that benny hill used to uh cross the line at times but he he managed to be pretty tasteful 

121.27 123.79 B: most of the time that was pretty innocent 

123.47 124.50 A: yeah 

124.76 127.57 A: are there any other things that you could think about besides like sexual 

127.72 128.59 A: that 

128.51 135.74 B: um well you know like i said the the whole bathroom humour is is pretty bad um 

128.73 130.18 A: would be crossing the line 

137.18 142.08 B: even i think it's worst than sexual stuff you know i mean 

140.87 146.30 A: right what kind of bathroom humour do you mean do you mean like i know one for example um 

147.15 154.27 A: the uh what movie is it dr dolittle have you ever seen dr dolittle the second when 

153.87 155.31 B: um 

154.51 158.17 A: he's in the bathroom the bear the bear i mean stuff like that or 

156.92 167.71 B: yes that is exactly what i'm talking about that is exactly what i am talking about yep um and and some of them can i some of the adam sandler movies 

167.34 168.28 A: right 

168.19 177.08 B: are pretty bad and and actually i think that the adam sandler movies where he was supposed to be um trying to raise the little boy 

176.86 177.76 A: okay 

177.31 179.25 B: you know which one i'm talking about 

178.24 179.12 A: yeah 

179.47 184.44 B: you know that kind of disturbed me some of the things that he he was doing you know with the 

184.04 185.65 A: being on the building 

184.45 185.37 B: kid 

185.56 189.46 B: uh exactly [laughter] that's what i'm thinking about 

186.71 188.01 A: mhm [laughter] 

189.47 191.76 B: (( you know and i thought that i mean )) 

191.77 196.83 B: i watched a child i was over at someone's house at a dinner party one night 

196.48 197.35 A: right 

197.05 198.95 B: and i kept going by the 

198.96 205.06 B: the bedroom when i would go to the bathroom where their their child was actually it was the grandson 

204.98 214.48 B: and i could see that he was in there watching that movie and i'm like you know i can't even believe that they're letting him watch this and i think he was watching it over and over and over again and and like if that is the 

214.66 218.69 B: what he is going to internalize as something that is appropriate and just 

218.10 218.82 A: (( no )) 

219.64 221.25 B: that kind of bothered me 

219.76 220.57 A: (( how )) 

221.63 222.84 A: old was he 

222.87 233.12 B: um he was under ten i don't know exactly how old he was but i i didn't think that that was i mean i don't think that parents really screen or grandparents sometimes screen what 

224.55 225.62 A: oh wow 

233.08 237.95 B: they just think that if it's a movie that is supposed to be funny that it's okay for their kids to watch 

237.73 239.69 A: yeah interesting 

239.57 241.84 B: yeah yeah 

242.01 243.09 B: um 

243.30 245.03 B: trying to think of any 

245.62 248.98 B: a a lot of the like the characters 

248.23 249.43 A: yeah 

249.80 256.13 B: mike myers is he he can cross the line too but some of the austin powers at least the first one was pretty funny 

255.27 257.24 A: yeah yeah 

256.73 260.16 B: [laughter] did did do you like mike myers 

259.50 265.94 A: i don't mind him i mean i i enjoy those movies but i can see where it could get out of had hand and like some people would be offended by it i mean 

265.90 271.87 B: well the character fat bastard that was definitely like over the top 

267.69 268.60 A: yeah 

269.20 270.02 A: yeah 

271.97 275.55 B: and when they showed the um the scenes where he was 

275.58 279.67 B: like he didn't have any clothes on and all of the fat and all of 

278.85 279.75 A: right 

280.45 283.01 B: the the passing gas humour that was a little much 

282.66 283.56 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

283.31 284.49 B: [laughter] 

284.71 290.73 A: yeah i agree i mean i have to admit some of it makes me laugh but i do understand 

291.21 292.58 A: that it is uh 

292.60 302.58 B: [noise] no i mean do you ever go and watch any of those i mean do you have to go with other people to a movie theatre to see them or do you just watch them if they happen to come on t._v. or something 

302.80 307.29 A: i watch them if they come on t._v. if i mean if i'm with other people i will 

308.51 318.54 B: cause i went to see um the austin powers the i guess it was the third one and it was horrible and i was disappointed because you know i really thought the first one was pretty funny 

318.09 319.07 A: yeah 

318.99 321.65 B: (( yeah and then the second wasn't bad but )) 

322.61 325.37 B: i think that um he he kind of over 

325.50 326.52 B: he's 

326.54 330.88 B: he's gone too far down that road it's time for him to come up with another character 

330.52 331.68 A: (( yeah )) 

332.97 334.66 B: he's run out of material 

335.39 337.64 A: where do you live and where do you live oh 

337.06 339.98 B: [noise] i live on the gulf coast in alabama 

339.75 340.69 A: okay 

340.49 341.64 B: and how about you 

341.31 342.78 A: i live in wisconsin 

342.55 346.51 B: oh wow wow wisconsin is supposed to be really nice 

343.24 344.27 A: yeah 

345.80 347.40 A: it is 

348.65 355.67 B: i'm kind of into cooking so i've always wanted to go and check out the cheese and things in wisconsin 

355.31 357.53 A: yeah we definitely have that [laughter] 

357.84 358.78 A: um 

362.44 370.65 B: yeah it is like i it said it's very difficult to you wouldn't think that a ten minute conversation would be that hard to keep up with the topic but it it definitely can be 

370.22 372.44 A: yeah when it's just one topic it can kind of 

373.04 374.84 A: run out of things to say [laughter] 

374.60 375.58 B: pardon me 

375.25 381.27 A: i said when it's just one topic and i mean when you know you have to talk for ten minutes you always have nothing to say 

380.88 392.47 B: right well okay if i mean i don't know whether you have kids or anything and i'm not going to pry but if um if you had children i mean what would you do to to try to make sure because i don't but um 

392.11 393.87 A: i don't i'm only twenty one 

393.40 400.73 B: oh okay okay but i mean if if what what would you suggest can be done to keep kids from watching that kind of stuff 

401.80 411.57 A: i think you've got to really monitor what's in your house i mean there's only so much you can do i think you can't monitor what they watch when they go to someone else's you can't monitor 

411.60 421.08 A: what they necessarily see at school or anywhere so you just have to really monitor what's in your house you know you don't rent movies that you don't think are appropriate or don't buy the movies you know 

421.17 423.04 A: that's all i think you can really do 

422.72 424.66 B: you're right well i mean it- it's 

425.10 433.46 B: an issue with um having step children you can't when when they come to visit if you see them every now and then you i mean you can't really 

433.53 435.08 B: you you can't 

435.99 438.06 B: you have no say [laughter] 

437.34 438.37 A: (( mhm )) 

438.16 447.11 B: in um in what they do or [noise] see and that can i'm raising blinds if you're wondering what that strange noise is [noise] anyway 

447.13 449.34 B: i i have found that frustrating 

449.32 450.22 A: yeah 

449.60 452.72 B: is that you really can't um monitor 

452.97 456.44 B: what someone else's children are going to do even if you 

456.58 458.37 B: feel as though you you know you 

458.38 460.38 B: want to try and steer them in the right direction 

459.95 461.60 A: you really can't yeah 

462.29 462.86 A: (( i )) 

465.63 466.81 B: so 

467.65 468.74 B: let's see 

469.03 471.06 A: (( know it's like hard so um )) 

470.67 474.72 B: um have have you checked to see how much time we have left on this thing or 

474.43 477.62 A: no i i this is my first time i've ever done 

477.07 479.16 B: oh it is okay 

479.32 490.51 B: i was very lucky because this is my third call but the first one um the topic was food and both of us you know were really into food i have been to school and so 

482.84 483.73 A: okay 

489.83 491.17 A: oh really 

490.55 501.06 B: yeah but even then i mean we we were fortunate that we had a lot to talk about but it was um it was still difficult to keep up for ten minutes and it's something that we talk about both of us all of the time you know 

500.62 501.39 A: right 

501.27 504.49 B: and the second one was um it was pretty 

504.55 507.94 B: (( interesting [laughter] it )) 

508.02 513.35 B: it it almost seemed like this person couldn't have possibly been real on the other end and it was like a 

513.60 515.56 B: um it was almost like a joke 

515.25 516.25 A: really 

515.80 523.04 B: yeah yeah it was very strange so i almost didn't do it again but but um this hasn't been bad but i wish there was more to talk about 

523.23 525.58 B: on that particular t- you know topic 

525.23 529.25 A: have you been calling in or are you um wait till they call you 

527.43 532.41 B: yeah yeah no i've been calling in it's it's been easier that way 

531.50 535.91 A: do you know if you have to leave a certain amount of time in between or can you call another 

536.07 542.15 B: um i think that they change the topic either daily or every forty eight hours i'm not sure how that works 

540.28 541.16 A: (( oh okay )) 

542.83 543.45 A: (( okay )) 

544.16 545.37 B: but um 

546.07 554.08 B: anyway it the first call was very interesting and actually the second call was interesting too in a different way it was just very strange 

553.88 555.89 A: what was the topic of the second one 

555.44 557.86 B: (( um well it was minimum wage )) 

557.52 558.47 A: oh 

558.98 560.30 B: minimum wage 

560.37 563.97 B: but um i mean it was the person sounded like 

564.13 565.44 B: she was 

566.00 572.02 B: a little odd i'll just put it that way i'll be diplomatic [laughter] she was very strange 

567.86 568.74 A: [laughter] 

572.19 573.82 A: hope i don't sound that way 

573.53 574.76 B: i'm sorry 

574.25 576.28 A: i said i hope i don't sound that way 

575.49 583.92 B: oh no no not at all i mean you're articulate and um but it's just it is hard to discuss that so what what else can we say about um 

584.45 586.77 A: well it's comedy uh 

588.52 591.77 A: i think humour gets out of line when you're making fun of other people 

591.52 592.72 B: i'm sorry 

592.23 596.49 A: i think humour gets out of line when you're making fun of certain people or groups of people 

594.99 596.28 B: that's a good point 

597.25 599.95 A: racial jokes um bad jokes
