16.71 18.21 A: yeah that's right 

17.75 18.77 B: okay 

18.90 23.14 B: um i'll start off by saying that um 

23.77 33.10 B: i would have to draw the line on um any type of humour that has to do with like racism or sexual orientation 

33.12 34.41 B: um 

35.21 36.71 B: even you know 

36.91 40.03 B: personal appearance whether it be like overweight 

40.46 42.05 B: or um 

42.07 43.51 B: balding 

43.87 45.17 B: what about you 

45.15 52.47 A: well i think that more so it's um i'm a news reporter and a lot of people make jokes about things that we're covering 

52.50 59.18 A: in the news like uh recently i don't know if you heard about the lacy peterson case shows like case of the missing woman 

56.35 57.84 B: oh yes 

58.85 59.79 B: yep 

59.55 62.89 A: and um a lot of people made 

63.45 65.10 A: you know jokes 

64.50 67.32 B: jokes bad that's definitely bad 

66.14 69.00 A: about her um 

69.36 83.25 A: you know she was found out her head and people were saying things like oh she lost her head over the whole thing you know and i just that's the kind of thing that really you know kind of gets to me i think is things that are 

72.14 72.94 B: yeah 

83.18 84.20 B: right 

83.29 91.77 A: and al- and also i'm i don't so much mind the the balding and the fat thing but um picking on um 

91.95 93.54 A: like groups like 

93.03 94.28 B: minorities 

93.69 106.07 A: disabled and minorities anything to do with like sexual you know things i guess that you can't that you just really can't help like sexual orientation i and then also the other one that gets to me is um the disabled 

99.30 100.39 B: can't help 

105.75 106.69 B: right 

106.37 110.49 A: picking on the disabled um that's like i know there is a lot of 

110.75 112.50 A: jokes about um 

112.68 119.07 A: especially special olympics and things like that i don't i don't like those but i guess the 

118.10 119.05 B: right 

119.10 124.24 A: fat one's don't i don't know why [laughter] 

120.65 122.23 B: bother you as much 

122.70 135.37 B: i mean i d- i think it's definitely a different level like when you're talking about any type of death or you know racism minorities or even sexual orientation that's on the top that really you know 

135.52 138.30 B: even war i don't like jokes about war 

137.98 141.52 A: the other thing i think that is kind of interesting is that um 

138.52 139.44 B: um 

141.65 151.20 A: you know it's amazing to me that jokes always come up like so quickly after things happen you know that people think of jokes 

149.01 150.10 B: right 

151.42 152.92 A: um you know 

152.53 163.23 B: right like for example at that um there was some jokes on the website about the war going on and you know americans killing iraqi's 

163.38 165.44 B: and you know some 

165.65 167.25 B: stuff on the website 

167.44 176.39 B: you know made a cartoons and jokes about that that just kind of didn't sit well with me i didn't think that jokes should be made out of human life being lost 

176.14 180.20 A: yeah that's true what about the jokes about the president do you um mind that at all 

180.47 182.88 B: (( that necessarily doesn't )) 

183.06 186.01 B: bother me as much just when it comes to like 

186.17 189.55 B: you know any type of human life or death but 

189.84 197.71 B: talking about the presidents character that's i can laugh at that i would say that's not in such bad taste 

197.49 202.29 A: uh-huh and what about do you ever hear um i mean do you 

202.31 208.10 A: i guess you have got to call yourself bostonians is that right yes do you ever hear jokes that are um 

204.20 206.45 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

208.32 210.31 A: that are like to 

210.36 212.16 A: the part of the country 

211.60 216.86 B: right yeah of course we always hear jokes about boston drivers and 

216.54 217.79 A: oh really 

217.04 222.07 B: and stuff like that that you know even being from boston my whole life that really 

222.69 233.74 B: i can laugh at it you know i just that that doesn't bother me um same going for you know if somebody made a joke about california would that bother you um not 

233.32 235.46 A: do you ever hear jokes about california 

235.07 236.60 B: (( ones well )) 

235.98 237.21 A: it wouldn't bother me 

238.92 243.16 B: maybe maybe you know imitations about accents and 

243.27 246.27 A: [laughter] do you think i sound like i have an accent 

245.90 248.50 B: no no not not really 

248.44 252.84 A: you do [laughter] our editor's from boston too she sounds just like you 

252.53 254.50 B: oh really [laughter] 

253.14 257.25 A: yeah [laughter] totally sometimes we'll kind of imitate her 

257.02 258.19 B: yeah 

257.27 265.15 A: accent um let's see what else it's also kind of funny how um you know jokes evolve over the years like you don't ever hear 

265.16 267.45 A: um you know knock knock 

267.38 269.63 B: (( right right )) 

267.61 274.58 A: you know [laughter] i was watching a movie last night and i heard someone tell a knock knock joke and i was like oh my god you know when was the last time you heard that 

274.13 275.56 B: right 

274.98 278.63 A: i wonder what kids what kind of jokes kids tell sometimes 

278.41 283.46 B: right it was a while i remember being in junior high and you had 

278.99 279.88 A: (( you know )) 

283.50 287.70 B: the same type jokes that were going around like 

287.74 291.07 B: you know your mother's so fat that she can't fit through the 

291.22 297.18 B: door and stuff like like they just one would come right off the other like 

297.40 301.36 B: (( do you know what i mean like your mama like )) 

298.19 299.17 A: yeah 

300.75 303.17 A: there is always jokes about your mother yeah 

302.31 304.23 B: (( especially like )) 

304.43 310.95 B: that it goes through phases i don't know i guess you know different groups go through different phases of like the types of jokes but 

311.62 325.29 B: i i would just say the bottom line just you know i strongly believe that you know any type of death situation or you know intentional pain on somebody jokes about that type of stuff just doesn't 

325.43 329.78 B: you know i think it's in bad taste and war um 

330.80 335.79 B: and race and sexual orientation and 

335.90 339.57 B: um that's about it i mean i don't 

339.80 340.91 B: (( like you know )) 

340.97 348.28 B: appearance like i said the overweight i guess you take it to a point but sometimes if it's directed you know to somebody 

347.95 348.95 A: mhm 

349.06 354.62 B: i you know that might be a little in bad taste i guess it all depends on the situation like you don't want to tell a joke 

355.30 360.58 B: like for example you wouldn't tell a joke to somebody who was like four hundred pounds like an overweight joke 

360.40 361.75 A: you'd try not to 

361.19 364.77 B: yeah exactly [laughter] it seems like you know somebody 

362.31 363.14 A: [laughter] 

364.70 365.62 A: (( have you ever )) 

365.62 371.34 B: disabled sister you wouldn't tell a joke to her about disabled people 

371.05 376.95 A: have you ever called anyone on a on a joke like have you ever said you know something like that's really inappropriate 

377.52 387.09 B: um actually i did i you know when i was when my um actually my step mother who played the animated cartoons with 

387.16 394.47 B: like the graphic like showing of like human life being lost and the war and stuff i you know i did say to her 

394.55 398.53 B: you know i really don't think that's too funny carole you know like 

398.92 402.27 B: where she did so she didn't see where i was coming from 

402.34 403.55 B: so we kind of 

403.57 405.14 B: disagreed on that 

404.99 408.45 A: isn't it funny how people have such a different taste 

405.88 406.87 B: yeah 

407.70 412.48 B: yeah she was laughing hysterical and i was like looking at her like 

412.70 413.72 B: um 

413.89 415.33 B: gees that's not 

416.06 418.55 B: i don't see the humour in that 

417.92 423.41 A: yeah the other thing is that i don't ever really see the humour in things like 

423.44 428.54 A: like really gross stuff like i know like a lot of people get um 

425.57 426.44 B: right 

428.57 441.80 A: really they think like that movie the jackass movie is really and um and that kind of a thing and like i remember i don't know how old you are but like the whole animal house thing with when i was in high school 

431.94 433.43 B: (( right )) 

441.42 442.46 B: right 

441.95 444.88 A: and i i never really thought that was funny like 

445.12 452.38 B: right anything like gross or inflicting pain on yourself or somebody like that type of stuff is gross 

445.21 446.14 A: (( you know )) 

450.33 451.54 A: yeah 

452.43 458.15 A: people people i guess the oldest joke is people slipping on a banana peel you know 

452.44 453.46 B: yeah 

457.89 458.84 B: right 

458.16 460.98 A: [laughter] um 

459.87 460.72 B: right 

461.06 461.79 A: (( can't )) 

461.81 462.99 A: say what else 

463.68 465.10 A: (( um )) 

464.36 468.20 B: i guess jokes something like jokes that embarrass 

468.34 474.10 B: pe- somebody in particular you know what i mean like can be funny but at the same time 

475.12 477.70 B: if it really hurt you know if it really hurt 

477.09 479.84 A: have you ever been hurt by a joke yourself 

479.14 480.22 B: (( um )) 

481.11 488.41 B: let me see i can't think off the top of my head but i know i've been in crowds and i've seen somebody 

488.54 495.22 B: play a joke on somebody else and kind of felt bad about it um cause it kind of humiliated them in front of a crowd and i 

491.39 492.48 A: uh-huh 

495.42 500.18 B: kind of did say to myself that wasn't nice it's kind of mean or in bad taste 

500.24 504.37 A: do you like to play jokes like on april fools are you like the type to play jokes 

505.26 515.49 B: um yeah actually this is a good example i um i did do a joke to my friend about and this is getting back to the president but 

516.03 519.78 B: she was appalled at me so this is a good example 

519.96 524.27 B: i uh called her up and i said turn the news on 

524.35 531.02 B: and i kind of like acted hysterical and she's like what what and i said something just happened to the president 

531.23 538.73 B: and she like got all like emotional and was like what did what did i'm like he's in the hospital nobody knows what happened to him but 

539.03 550.02 B: you know he's in the hospital and blah blah blah and she started freaking out and then you know i said happy april fool's day and she said that's mean you shouldn't of done that like she 

548.07 549.83 A: (( oh ))

556.14 558.01 A: oh wow 

557.22 564.70 B: yeah so that was a good example i mean i myself thought it was kind of funny because i got her good but 

564.63 565.68 A: yeah 

565.10 568.22 B: and i don't see like like i said i don't

571.45 573.15 A: you didn't see the harm in it 

572.35 583.71 B: didn't see the harm as long as i said april fools day i mean if i had let her go on the whole day thinking that really happened then that would have been different but where as i told her real quick oh april fools it was just like real quick and over [laughter]
