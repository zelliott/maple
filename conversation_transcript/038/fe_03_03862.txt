21.71 30.14 A: um [sigh] let me see [sigh] well the que- topic was where do you draw the line between acceptable comedy and comedy itself i guess 

30.40 37.21 A: um you know [sigh] nowadays comedy is not what it used to be it used to be like all vaudeville acts 

37.41 40.99 B: mhm [noise] 

37.48 38.63 A: um 

38.96 43.41 A: [sigh] i i guess if it makes you laugh it- it's it's comedy [sigh] um 

43.50 48.39 A: you know like hear no evil see no evil's comedy with you know gene wilder and um 

48.63 52.04 A: richard pryor then you have jerry seinfeld funny 

52.05 54.67 A: (( um [sigh] i don't know i think [cough] )) 

55.21 69.75 A: depending on the context that a- anything can be funny in the context that's what i you know [sigh] depending on what context was used [sigh] um just like black comedies you know like where it's it's bad like when somebody dies but everybody's having a good time about it 

59.00 61.43 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

65.57 67.52 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

69.42 70.28 B: (( yep )) 

70.22 71.37 A: um 

71.85 77.30 A: [cough] i guess i draw the line when it just becomes offensive towards me or someone i know 

77.52 83.05 A: i guess that's when it becomes uh that's when i draw the line which usually doesn't happen very often 

83.24 89.22 A: but i guess if people if it's done mean spirited that's when i guess i take the draw the line 

87.52 91.54 B: (( [noise] [noise] yes [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

89.86 104.32 A: um like i've seen several standup um acts and when they s- want to start ragging on the audience 'cause they don't have any more jokes [sigh] you know sometimes that's funny but you know they take it a little too far and then it's pretty much like you know you suck so why are you even up there 

93.36 94.31 B: [noise] 

103.99 105.86 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

104.89 107.05 A: so that's basically [sigh] 

106.90 112.48 B: what about what about [mn] uh young teen teen comedy 

112.08 113.55 A: teen comedy [laughter] 

112.97 117.29 B: yeah like uh jackass or things like that 

116.83 118.51 A: (( well uh [sigh] [cough] )) 

119.96 128.92 A: like i i guess i could see that as being comedy but it i think of it more as being stupid than [sigh] you know 'cause it's like you know kids you know just people just trying to be 

121.79 122.50 B: [noise] 

125.43 127.89 B: [noise] yeah [noise] 

129.15 133.25 A: i don't know dumb i guess [sigh] it's like um shock value 

130.92 132.52 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

133.49 134.61 B: shock value 

134.47 141.89 A: yeah it's i don't really see jackass as comedy you know i'll probably laugh at it [cough] i haven't seen it [sigh] but i mean i'm sure i'd laugh at parts of it 

138.23 138.79 B: (( [noise] )) 

139.85 143.30 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

142.11 145.34 A: [cough] but i don't i w i don't see it as actual comedy 

145.58 146.28 B: mm 

145.78 147.04 A: and how about you 

147.02 150.97 B: well i i tend to like jim carrie he's a funny guy 

150.60 151.64 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

151.00 152.95 B: and robin williams they're 

153.11 158.14 B: they're pretty good uh but i tend to go for the stupid funny i guess just 'cause i'm 

158.48 164.57 B: [noise] that kind of person but yeah i tend to like stupid comedy more than 

160.29 161.36 A: (( [mn] right )) 

164.77 175.49 B: uh classic comedy kinda like standup comedians and things but you know standup comedians are good [sigh] i laugh at some of them um i don't know 

168.89 170.01 A: right 

170.08 170.64 A: (( [cough] )) 

176.27 176.97 A: (( mm )) 

177.44 180.15 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] there's not much else about to say about 

177.59 178.15 A: (( [cough] )) 

179.70 183.89 A: well [cough] that's true until you take it to a point where like [cough] if 

183.99 192.76 A: you think [mn] you know you say classic comedy and then you know the stupid comedies but [sigh] you know there really there isn't really any stupid comedies there's the just the situations they make fun of like road trip 

192.80 194.95 B: (( oh yeah )) 

193.31 196.74 A: you know uh clerks there's another one 

196.87 204.45 A: uh more you know those are all it's like abstract funny it's like you have to be in on the joke to get it to be funny 

197.28 197.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

203.92 205.48 B: (( yeah )) 

204.66 209.50 A: uh which is fine i like that as well i mean you i mean it keeps you up to date lets you know what's going on 

208.61 209.58 B: [noise] 

209.54 214.15 A: [cough] and they really don't go over the edge and like mainstream movies they really don't go over the edge 

214.43 216.91 A: you know it it's pretty much 

214.61 216.17 B: (( oh yeah )) 

217.40 221.08 A: you know in in an acceptable area it's not going to offend anybody 

220.92 222.63 B: (( [noise] oh yeah )) 

221.59 228.08 A: uh barber shop pissed off a lot of people [noise] but i laughed i laughed really hard at barber shop at certain parts oh you haven't 

225.62 227.31 B: [noise] [noise] i didn't see it 

227.80 228.56 B: (( no )) 

228.11 237.66 A: um i can see why it you know pissed off a lot of people [sigh] but at the same token he did it in a context where he wasn't trying to be mean spiteful and hateful you know what i mean 

229.80 231.86 B: (( yeah [noise] oh )) 

237.34 239.26 B: yeah 

237.88 242.56 A: but i guess people just took it that way even though he wasn't portraying himself that way 

243.05 254.37 A: so i guess that's where they they want to know about drawing the line [sigh] i don't know if they they want to talk about race or gender or ethnicity [sigh] or or whatever but um 

254.49 262.25 A: [mn] [sigh] you can poke fun at anything it just depends on the people you're [mn] trying to poke fun at and [sigh] and who's listening to you doing it um 

262.39 272.43 A: you know i'd like if i'm in the office and [cough] somebody's telling a sexist joke you know i really don't take i don't think it's funny because it's not the right time or place to be telling a joke like that 

271.81 273.04 B: oh definitely [noise] 

272.71 280.21 A: you know i mean there's a time and place for everything and i basically i think that's where i'd that's where i actually draw the line at i mean it's just like it comes 

280.32 280.88 A: (( [cough] )) 

280.70 283.79 B: in the right situation and the right places 

282.08 285.13 A: right in the r- there's a place and time for everything 

284.45 285.74 B: exactly 

285.38 290.12 A: um and and i guess that has a lot to do with it as well um 

287.76 290.20 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

290.16 296.54 A: as far as drawing the line i mean there really is no line for comedy that's why they call it comedy 

295.92 298.12 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

297.13 300.71 A: you know that's like the divine comedy that's that's one that's not even any 

299.21 300.83 B: [noise] that was 

300.84 304.11 A: not even funny it's just about you know death [laughter] 

303.11 315.67 B: you're with me exactly [noise] there is not drawing the line because you wouldn't be able to speak your mind [noise] and that is what your mind is saying is [sigh] you know everybody has different way of saying their comedy and things like that you know 

315.29 316.60 A: mhm 

315.82 323.52 B: so everyone expresses themselves [noise] differently [sigh] so it's so there really is no drawing the line exactly what you said so 

322.78 330.12 A: mm right it just depends on like [cough] if you think something's not is is going to be too much for you you don't you don't watch it 

329.40 330.97 B: yeah exactly 

329.96 339.02 A: you know [sigh] it's like eddie murphy raw that's one of my favorite favorite things to watch ever i i laughed and i i every time i've seen it a hundred times i laugh every time i watch it 

334.39 335.54 B: yeah 

338.67 340.00 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

339.07 352.97 A: you know because he takes what he has and he makes it funny you know he takes personal experience and he makes it funny some people see that like like devout christians and jehovah's witness and some catholics look at that and think it's just [sigh] 

352.83 358.01 A: you know a sin because you know he cusses he makes fun of sex and the human body and 

358.22 362.77 A: you know but [sigh] they don't need to watch it if they want to make a g- big hubbub out of it 

358.40 359.96 B: yeah 

362.19 363.62 B: exactly 

363.53 366.84 A: [lipsmack] so i guess i don't draw the line really in comedy 

363.66 364.64 B: (( they [noise] )) 

367.14 368.94 B: [noise] definitely not they shouldn't 

367.98 368.96 A: (( no )) 

369.12 373.32 A: basically if they if they have the gall to get up there and say it you know i'm gonna listen to it 

372.58 373.81 B: exactly 

373.56 374.62 A: so 

373.90 385.50 B: they i don't know but people nowadays they've got some people really just don't know how to take it and things like that and they just totally g- you know they're just not 

385.51 389.06 B: even thinking about it they're just getting pissed off because of w- 

389.15 396.06 B: it you know just like older people most times get mad at younger people for doing that stupid comedy 

395.44 396.57 A: right 

396.02 410.46 B: and younger people really don't like that older comedy like [noise] classic standup comedian things so [cough] i don't know i some p- sometimes it kinda makes me angry how older people discriminate when 

402.51 403.82 A: right 

410.38 415.26 B: they're saying younger people are not i- able to express their ideas like that [sigh] 

414.88 418.53 A: well that's true and then there are some younger people who discriminate as well though 

418.18 419.54 B: exactly 

418.85 427.00 A: um and then i know some really old people who who are the m- m- more fun than the pr- people my age i mean i'm only twenty eight years old i know people who are like in their sixties 

423.89 424.73 B: (( yeah oh )) 

426.71 427.78 B: yeah 

427.10 439.72 A: [sigh] who who think things are hilarious you know that i think are hilarious [sigh] it's like it's like we just live in a sheltered society and everything has its merit just like [sigh] they say that you know uh substance abuse is a disease well it's not everybody makes a choice 

430.51 431.29 B: (( [noise] )) 

439.21 440.36 B: yeah 

439.66 443.21 A: you know that's why we have free will you make choices and you live with it 

442.65 444.60 B: yeah definitely [noise] 

443.45 450.99 A: so that that that's the line you know you have to draw the line of your own and [sigh] and it's basically [cough] what you're comfortable with 

448.40 448.96 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

450.80 459.45 B: oh definitely yeah [sigh] [lipsmack] it all just depends on what you like so [sigh] people really shouldn't discriminate other people 'cause it 

455.32 456.26 A: right 

458.57 460.37 A: oh that's a that's a fact 

460.26 464.75 B: yeah it's definitely been it's happened to me and other people [sigh] 

463.35 464.22 A: mhm 

465.04 468.81 B: 'cause i've done a lot of comedy things too [cough] 

467.92 472.66 A: right [sigh] well the problem with it is what people don't understand they tend to criticize 

472.54 473.79 B: exactly 

473.15 486.66 A: you know and that makes a that makes a that's that's a big problem as well you know [sigh] people who are intelligent when they have nothing else when they have no words to come back what has happened [sigh] then they go into you know their their their self protection mode where they lash out 

483.24 483.82 B: [noise] 

486.13 487.44 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

486.71 489.88 A: and th- that's just that's just human nature you know 

490.24 497.54 A: that's j- i don't know i don't and that's why we invented comedy so we can get over that stuff you know 'cause if you can't laugh at a situation you're basically you know 

494.17 495.17 B: (( yeah )) 

497.80 498.78 A: [laughter] 

498.81 501.12 A: you know it's you it's downhill from there 

499.55 500.68 B: not very 

501.00 503.10 B: yeah definitely definitely 

503.05 504.98 B: i i definitely agree with you 

504.93 519.36 B: but [laughter] oh the most part i'm just saddened by [sigh] the discrimination and all that stuff about comedians and things like that [sigh] because it's happened to a lot of different people and that's the only thing [sigh] i really have to 

516.39 517.59 A: oh yeah well the 

518.05 529.34 A: just like george cole i mean you know he was one of he was a great comic until he came out with his top ten list [sigh] you know with all those th- the cuss words and everything he played it on the air i mean he was blackballed he was a great comedian 

522.97 524.24 B: yeah
