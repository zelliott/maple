3.51 4.96 A: ashley i'm cheryl 

4.55 11.22 B: hi cheryl can i ask you to hold for one second cause i'm on the other line when this service called me so one second thank you 

6.82 7.68 A: (( oh yeah )) 

9.64 10.79 A: no problem 

15.40 16.41 B: hello 

15.84 19.54 A: hi it really was one second [laughter] 

16.43 18.07 B: hi i'm sorry about that 

18.20 23.86 B: yeah i know i just said i'll call you right back um did you hear the question clearly 

22.91 24.49 A: yes i did 

24.05 25.17 B: good 

24.52 25.77 A: it's uh 

26.39 27.55 A: (( it's um )) 

27.92 33.24 A: in comedy where do you draw the line between i guess funny and offensive 

33.03 36.86 B: okay that's an interesting uh that's an interesting topic 

36.46 37.61 A: right 

37.15 39.79 B: where would you like to know first 

39.07 53.39 A: sure i mean i guess my feeling is you know if it if there is even a remote opportunity that it offends somebody um i'm one that that doesn't find that kind of humour funny any way to begin with and um 

53.50 65.08 A: you know especially if if somebody has the potential to get hurt and and that i just don't i don't see any humour in that at all so i guess i'm pretty strict when it comes to that 

64.98 65.88 B: okay 

65.55 67.54 A: yeah i just um 

67.59 69.68 A: you know i'm not really 

69.69 73.03 A: a jokey kind of person anyway you know so um 

72.31 73.24 B: mhm 

73.34 78.74 A: you know and and i think people who know me know that too i don't tend to get a lot of people that will say 

78.76 85.41 A: um tell me jokes that are suggestive or you know have the possibility of offending somebody so 

85.28 86.28 B: mhm 

85.36 97.75 A: um yeah i don't know if it's just my demeanor but i don't get that a lot of people you know doing that to me which is good but uh yeah i'm i'm one who will probably frown upon it [laughter] 

92.73 94.14 B: mhm 

96.96 108.96 B: right so i guess you don't get a lot of those internet jokes um i mean the the forwards that get sent around that are kind of discriminatory against one group or the other your friends probably don't send you those then [laughter] 

107.80 111.94 A: yeah they probably don't [laughter] i'm guessing how about you 

109.63 110.71 B: (( yeah )) 

111.42 112.47 B: that's good 

112.69 113.65 B: um 

113.56 128.18 B: well i actually i i am into humour a lot i mean i i love comedy i love comedians but and i wouldn't say that i'm easily offended but i know when i am offended and i think that there is certain topics that i am 

116.96 118.26 A: (( right )) 

128.19 142.84 B: um much more likely to be offended by um i don't think it's ever appropriate to joke about um rape or child abuse or animal cruelty um 

143.34 148.09 B: those are three of my big ones that set me off and everybody that knows me knows 

147.95 161.76 B: not to joke about those three things i think that those are far too serious that there's no there there there's nothing laughable about those three subjects at all i there there there's no joke that can be made from that subject matter that would be funny 

156.17 157.19 A: right 

161.80 165.74 B: um i'm able to to um 

166.10 168.52 B: take a laugh at different um 

168.99 183.37 B: different um groups different ethnic groups etcetera because i fall into one of them i'm arab by decent and um i am able to laugh at arab jokes that that aren't too serious and certainly in this 

183.56 190.27 B: time there's a lot of those going around and i am very hard to offend me with one of those jokes so um 

190.60 193.66 B: you know i don't mind if it's to the mild degree 

193.52 194.42 A: yeah 

193.99 204.50 B: personally however i think that when they are presented in films and in television that you really could hurt somebody and offend them and make them ashamed of their own 

204.38 211.04 B: their own group and that's not right but personally telling me a joke i i have a pretty high tolerance 

210.14 216.91 A: right and and i think you brought up a good point it all depends on the context as well um you know i 

214.87 215.84 B: mhm 

217.10 224.59 A: i'm able to laugh at myself too and you know certain things are are funny but you know if you're if you're using racial 

224.93 230.85 A: derogatory racial comments or names and stuff i don't find that funny at all you know and um 

229.24 230.30 B: right 

230.86 232.16 A: the um 

232.49 242.10 A: the subject you brought up rape and animal cruelty and stuff i mean yeah that that wouldn't go with me at all but you know if someone is going to tell me a 

236.23 237.39 B: mhm 

239.56 241.32 B: right 

242.18 254.83 A: you know quote unquote blonde joke or something i'm i'm going to laugh i mean i don't find that offensive and and uh it i guess it all depends for me in the context as well you know it's uh 

244.48 245.75 B: (( yeah )) 

248.94 249.81 B: right 

255.03 256.47 A: some people 

256.83 265.16 A: you know to a degree i'll know you know in some cases if you think you use really derogatory language to call another a group something you know even 

263.94 265.85 B: right 

265.38 269.75 A: even if you don't feel that way or whatever i i take offence to that 

269.54 270.94 B: yeah 

270.29 276.51 A: you know what i mean and um i think i think gosh i mean with all that's happening these days i'm 

276.66 290.36 A: um you know and you're background and your ethnicity i i admire you for [laughter] you know you're able to kind of laugh at some things but you know there is a lot of negativity going around and a lot of humour that 

290.37 293.53 A: you know not really humorous but um 

292.17 293.28 B: mhm 

293.61 300.86 A: that can be um you know i think offensive but i guess it just depends you know it depends i guess who's telling the joke and 

300.94 304.74 A: in what context you know if it's a very close friend of mine 

304.87 314.08 A: although they probably wouldn't tell me that kind of joke you know i might be able to accept it a little more than you know than somebody an acquaintance or whatever that i i hardly know 

313.83 315.06 B: mhm 

314.36 316.30 A: you know that type of thing so 

316.85 328.59 B: right i agree i think it's it definitely is dependant upon where you're hear the joke if a friend of mine told me an arab joke i might not be offended if i heard it on jay leno i i i 

328.54 330.77 B: might call the show serious 

330.72 334.55 B: um it really you know it really kind of depends 

334.41 337.00 B: not only what the contents of the joke 

336.86 338.41 B: are but um 

338.20 342.37 B: but the audience it's being delivered to [sigh] 

342.30 353.33 B: the person that's telling it and what you think that the motive is for telling this joke if you think the motive for tell the joke is to unite against a certain minority group or something like that to get 

353.23 359.87 B: to get people to gang up on a minority group i mean that's terrible or to spread misinformation 

357.82 359.12 A: right 

359.71 372.86 B: if you're going to go with a stereotype in my mind or something that's been around for a long time if you want to make fun of you know polish people doing things you know the really hard way you know the long way to get something done or 

372.80 380.62 B: you know or or jewish people saving every penny or arab people you know being you know fighters or you know i don't know 

375.95 377.08 A: right 

381.18 392.93 B: camel jockeys or whatever you know i mean those stereotypes have been around for ever and everybody's heard them and so they're not hugely offensive but during also during a time of war 

386.91 387.81 A: right 

392.79 393.94 A: yeah 

392.96 402.04 B: when the arab's you know there's lot of hate crimes the hate crimes have gone way up against arabs it's not a good time to be telling arab jokes 

398.96 399.88 A: right 

401.48 402.87 A: (( right you )) 

402.09 403.01 B: um 

403.06 404.57 A: are absolutely right 

403.23 406.25 B: if they can be taken the wrong way but 

405.54 416.84 A: okay oh yeah but i remember um i'm i'm trying to think um you had mentioned comedy in movies and um one that came to mind that i know caused some controversy was that movie shallow hal 

411.50 412.80 B: mhm 

417.23 418.63 A: do you remember that 

417.36 421.52 B: yeah that's right yeah i never i never saw it but yeah that's a good point 

419.80 428.02 A: i never did either but i thought um it would be interesting just to kind of just to see you know cause i had heard you know some people really 

427.92 442.34 A: took offence to that you know because they really thought it was making fun of over weight people you know taken to the extreme and then you know there's others on the other side that you know found is completely fun and not offensive at all so 

442.10 443.15 B: right 

442.37 455.15 A: um i think that's probably a good example of of maybe you know something or a movie that can really divide people and and that and yeah i didn't see it either but uh but it could be interesting 

453.13 454.33 B: mhm 

455.23 463.27 B: yeah and and it's also telling that neither of us saw it i mean it's not my type of film and i get the impression that it's probably not your type of film either 

458.09 459.13 A: (( yeah )) 

462.57 463.92 A: yeah 

463.28 472.94 B: um but that also says something they're taking a chance when they're poking fun at at a group they're taking a chance of eliminating potential audience viewers 

472.38 474.21 A: oh yeah 

473.05 474.06 B: um 

474.69 475.98 B: yeah that's 

475.90 482.20 A: but you know someone i i mean gwyneth paltrow she's a huge star and yet she you know she starred in it so 

476.14 477.17 B: interesting 

482.35 483.84 A: (( you know if if )) 

484.32 488.26 A: not that it has more credibility but usually these kind of humorous comedy 

488.70 491.23 A: movies a lot of them that are silly and 

491.26 496.79 A: what not are usually there's people in there you have never heard of before you know [laughter] you the real minor league 

494.84 496.85 B: mhm 

496.95 499.20 A: superstars i guess and that so 

499.07 499.89 B: true 

499.60 501.70 A: yeah but yeah it's 

501.59 506.91 A: i agree it's a movie that i didn't see and you're right that those type of movies with those 

506.79 519.03 A: real low brow humour that you know animal house type movies and stuff yeah it's just not just not me i probably wouldn't see it but but i you know my husband on it other hand can just finds those type of things hilarious you know 

510.00 511.14 B: mhm 

513.57 514.66 B: right 

518.10 519.46 B: (( yeah )) 

519.65 522.24 B: (( [laughter] )) 

519.79 528.52 A: so i think yeah i mean humour depends on i guess maybe on you know the different sexes too i think females might find something more funny than 

528.55 532.97 A: men i don't know tend to find other things more funny you know so 

532.00 532.99 B: right 

532.98 535.39 A: um and you know i guess it just 

535.56 538.01 A: it just sort of depends um 

538.81 539.84 A: um 

540.46 547.15 A: on um you know i think lot of times humour maybe the old boys type club that type of thing you know where 

546.15 547.61 B: mhm 

547.18 561.95 A: some of the jokes might have been accepted and what not back then that maybe in the workplace now that's more diversified you know you're not going to hear as men as jokes like that and i think that's a good a good thing [laughter] yeah um 

554.40 555.57 B: mhm 

560.03 561.27 B: right 

562.04 563.93 A: those are my feelings on it too 

563.73 565.99 B: yeah um 

566.10 574.34 B: i'm trying to think i know that there has been films that i've seen or comedians that i've seen that i thought gee i found that person really offensive 

574.54 589.50 B: and unfortunately now when i really need to recall it i can't think of of of who they are i'm i'm really racking my brain right now i know that not too long ago maybe six months ago i said you know i don't find that person funny because i just thought they were very offensive 

578.04 579.10 A: [laughter] 

589.59 592.56 B: um and now i can't think of who it is 

591.55 595.47 A: when it comes to mine i mean i don't even think he's performing anymore but 

595.03 595.97 B: mhm 

595.96 599.89 A: was one too that um that um you know i just 

596.26 597.34 B: yeah 

597.44 598.33 B: yes
