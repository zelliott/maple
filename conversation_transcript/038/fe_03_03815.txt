93.07 94.10 B: and ah 

97.19 100.72 B: well ah usually it's ah 

101.01 101.82 B: it's 

102.70 107.75 B: you know just really acceptable comedy but every now and then they've ah 

105.70 107.35 A: good 

107.86 110.35 B: they've had someone on there that ah 

111.23 117.23 B: that it's kind of racial and ah and i find that 

114.04 115.13 A: oh 

117.22 118.61 A: offensive 

118.28 123.79 B: offensive sometimes but ah they've got some of them on there that that ah 

119.93 120.81 A: uh-huh 

124.20 125.11 B: (( ah )) 

125.67 128.41 B: i say like a black comedian that 

128.44 132.93 B: that makes jokes about black comedy and and ah 

130.97 132.02 A: okay 

133.05 137.85 B: and some of it's not real offensive but i i feel kinda 

138.06 142.10 B: ah in this day and age find it a little offensive ah 

140.79 153.78 A: uh-huh so you think it's better if they poke fun at themselves like if a a jew would make jokes about jews or or catholic about catholic or black about black 

153.85 159.90 A: (( does that [laughter] )) 

154.10 156.93 B: no [laughter] do you 

157.39 161.20 B: because they're not the only ones that's in that group [laughter] 

160.22 171.96 A: okay right oh okay i see what you're saying i i yeah the i kind of agree with you i it's easy to catch the drift but maybe they're going too far sometimes 

161.24 162.11 B: (( so )) 

171.61 173.90 B: i think so and 

172.70 179.14 A: i think what would bother me even probably more than that is if it just gets a little too risque 

178.90 179.88 B: yeah 

178.97 188.33 A: a little off color now late at night after all the you know school young children and school age are in bed if they want to get a little 

188.64 192.62 A: you know over the line at midnight i don't care [laughter] 

192.37 198.39 B: yeah i still even after midnight with no children around i still find ah 

198.56 201.29 B: the comedy that uses ah 

201.48 210.61 B: ah bad words i find that extremely offe- offensive i i don't think that's funny i don't think you have to say words like that to be funny 

205.70 207.01 A: yeah i 

210.35 216.51 A: exactly ah it just shows a limited vocabulary as far as i'm concerned 

214.98 215.96 B: yeah 

216.43 226.67 A: um and and a lot of times on those sitcoms even earlier in the evening they say some pretty bad stuff i mean i grew up in the nineteen fifties [laughter] when 

216.66 217.43 B: (( [mn] )) 

225.95 227.39 B: yeah 

226.77 232.54 A: you know when all that was off limits so it's kinda hard to adjust to it now 

232.29 239.06 B: yeah i find that here lately ah like you said even the seven and eight o'clock ah sitcoms 

239.09 247.90 B: that are specifically directed at families ah they they use them some really risque things 

242.38 244.93 A: mhm 

247.92 258.85 A: yeah i think so and kids are used to i'm a i'm a retired school teacher so i know how the children talked about what they watched on t._v. and us- in most families there's not 

248.11 249.02 B: (( ah )) 

258.80 267.27 A: t._v. is not monitored all that well it's used more like a baby sitter 'cause mom and dad both work and they're just so glad to have the kids [laughter] 

267.08 268.04 B: yeah 

267.25 271.63 A: you know not bothering them in the evening so they can get their stuff done at home 

271.53 284.10 A: that they don't always know what they're watching and that includes my own grandchildren i have three grandchildren who are teenagers all three thirteen fifteen and seventeen and they watch shows i wouldn't have allowed my kids to watch [laughter] 

283.80 284.76 B: yeah 

284.62 294.34 A: and yet they come from you know a good family goes to church on sunday and all that but i i really don't care for that comedy like 

294.42 306.42 A: ah the cartoon kind of stuff like king of the hill and simpsons and all that stuff i wouldn't dream of watching it but my youngest grandson i've seen him watch caught him watching the simpsons before 

298.26 299.93 B: oh yeah 

306.37 309.64 B: yeah and the simpsons they get really bad 

309.04 310.65 A: oh i know 

310.16 312.07 B: really bad they're 

311.10 320.20 A: and they talk about all kinds of subjects and you know belittle or as as far as i'm concerned they ah show a lack of respect 

319.99 321.00 B: yeah 

320.20 330.39 A: toward our country and president and and all kind of things that [mn] you know i believe in and want to see the good morals i'd shown 

330.23 331.20 B: yeah 

331.42 332.74 B: and when you're 

332.87 336.43 B: letting your children watch a sitcom you expect it 

337.04 338.78 B: some reason [laughter] 

338.79 341.49 B: you expect it to be clean you don't 

341.22 343.16 A: right 

342.11 343.00 B: (( ah )) 

343.49 346.86 B: yeah they just they're doing getting really raunchy on there 

346.59 357.31 A: yeah it's it's like you say the the words they use and just the general overtones and and the idea that it's okay to 

357.38 361.09 A: not show respect for the flag the country 

361.13 365.05 A: you know ah anything moral and uplifting 

365.08 366.16 B: yeah 

365.12 370.11 A: motherhood and all that it seems like the accepted thing is all the 

370.35 372.99 A: ah broken homes and 

373.01 380.45 A: you know the divorce all that kind of stuff every the dysfunctional family is supposed to be funny i guess if you would 

380.61 382.73 A: trust the simpsons to tell you 

382.61 383.73 B: yeah 

384.20 388.45 B: in a cartoon like that you would expect it to be okay for children 

388.41 390.08 A: well yeah i mean even 

389.01 391.31 B: well it used to be but 

390.17 398.65 A: even saturday morning cartoons i don't watch any of that stuff but i think there's a lot of bam bam you know all the the fighting and ah 

392.57 393.55 B: uh-huh 

399.09 403.06 A: so on there's a lot of violence as well as the off 

403.28 405.28 A: limits humor type stuff 

404.33 412.47 B: yeah i have a little three year old granddaughter who just turned three and she was watching the cartoon channel a lot and ah 

408.18 409.11 A: uh-huh 

412.66 419.52 B: i was her nanny for a couple years and told my daughter i said there's a lot of stuff on that cartoon channel that 

419.56 423.64 B: (( ah sexually oriented that's ah )) 

421.85 424.14 A: (( mhm )) 

424.01 435.66 B: you know really physically violent ah i really don't think she should watch it you know in the and a lot of it you'd be amazed and it's aimed towards young children 

432.02 432.86 A: mhm 

434.36 436.18 A: (( mhm )) 

436.08 437.15 B: (( and ah )) 

437.17 438.39 B: she had 

437.22 443.42 A: i think i think some of the companies the movie people are trying to make a lot of money now by 

443.30 454.36 A: even producing movies like toy story and i don't even know what all their names are all but different stories that have cartoon like figures and it has 

454.91 466.72 A: overtones that the adults pick up on and supposedly the children watching don't [laughter] so that when you take your kids to the movie you're getting a hoot out of some of the stuff they say 

460.65 461.84 B: [laughter] 

466.69 476.02 A: and it's supposed to go over the top of the heads of the children but i think that today's children are pretty sophisticated and i'm not so sure all that's going over their heads 

466.78 467.67 B: yeah 

475.54 477.76 B: yeah i don't think it is at all 

478.52 479.85 B: not at all 

479.75 490.45 A: so it seems to not only be the sitcoms and the late night ah talk shows' comedians but just it can be the movies it can be anywhere anytime 

490.28 491.36 B: yeah 

491.38 501.71 A: i i like to watch the view at eleven it's on at eleven a._m. here with barbara walters and i don't know whether you're familiar with that show or not the view 

500.25 511.62 B: yeah it's well it's on at ten here the same time as the price is right [laughter] and i just love bob barber so [laughter] and i think he's funny [laughter] and he's very friendly funny 

503.11 506.04 A: uh-huh [laughter] 

506.14 508.40 A: oh okay so you haven't seen it 

508.42 513.29 A: yeah he is and he's kind of an old timer kind of guy [laughter] 

512.97 514.46 B: (( yeah )) 

513.79 517.43 A: where he's not all off color and all that stuff 

516.90 518.00 B: yeah 

517.36 527.33 A: but anyway i've i like watching the view and i get um really enjoy hearing the viewpoint of women of different ages but they get pretty carried away on there too 

527.22 533.20 A: i mean anybody that has children around the house or are baby sitting you'd have to be careful what you 

527.32 528.75 B: yeah yeah 

533.26 542.29 A: let them see even on shows like that or doctor phil in the afternoon or even oprah i think hardly any show is totally 

539.67 540.64 B: uh-huh 

542.37 544.30 A: childproof any more 

544.35 545.98 B: no i don't think so 

545.92 560.77 A: so well i can see that we pretty much agree on [laughter] on this subject i don't know what to do about it but i guess tune out like don't let your little three year old granddaughter watch things when you're in charge 

551.11 552.18 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

559.33 569.53 B: yeah she watches she watches ah i don't know if you have channel eight there but ah it's c._b._s. broadcasting and it's ah sesame street and 

565.97 572.28 A: (( [laughter] oh good yeah )) 

569.80 574.35 B: and things like that and and we've started putting that on and when 

574.38 577.47 B: there's nothing on there then then ah 

577.63 580.50 B: we have d._v._d.s that she can watch that 

580.23 581.58 A: oh that's good 

580.89 581.82 B: (( that ah )) 

582.05 587.21 A: i watch public television myself a lot because that's one thing you can trust [laughter] 

587.37 590.76 B: well hopefully so far [laughter] 

589.10 599.89 A: so far so good yeah i'm kind of old fashioned i i still like to watch laurence welk on saturday nights and i like to watch that rick steve traveling around europe 

591.00 592.03 B: (( yeah ))
