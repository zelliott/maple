7.90 11.00 B: i'm in um ohio cleveland 

10.42 16.36 A: oh in cleveland well i went to college at overland so that wasn't that far away yeah 

11.40 12.19 B: uh-huh 

13.83 15.43 B: oh did you really 

15.70 19.88 B: actually that's relatively close to me 'cause i live on the west side of cleveland 

18.05 28.82 A: right oh do you yes yes ah well that's [sigh] cool [sigh] it's ah i have you talked to somebody before on this oh okay well 

19.97 20.84 B: mhm 

23.56 24.54 B: yeah 

26.79 27.93 B: no i haven't 

28.76 34.41 A: they they 'cause the first person i talked to was in florida and the second one was in a suburb of 

34.58 38.06 A: of philadelphia so it's like [laughter] 

35.80 36.70 B: okay 

37.55 39.28 B: it's all over the map 

38.67 44.43 A: i guess so yes yes well i think we're supposed to talk about comedy and what 

44.62 53.49 A: what how do how do we draw the line between acceptable humor and humor that's in bad taste and i guess my my reaction my first one was um 

49.32 50.49 B: right 

53.59 57.69 A: ah i know it when i see it [laughter] or i hear it it's something 

56.50 58.01 B: or you feel it 

57.76 63.82 A: feel it yeah that's a good good one i- it's it's like um something that 

63.95 75.17 A: is is um is very uh hurtful to somebody else i don't like that um i um i don't like ethnic slurs 

69.87 70.76 B: right 

75.23 85.10 A: except i was thinking that i do i've laughed at irish jokes so [laughter] yeah it's like it's like i haven't found th- the set of words that work with it what about you 

83.82 97.97 B: [laughter] right well and i i think a lot of it is dependent on the company that you're in if you're with your family and you're you know like i'm italian and we always make fun of the sopranos and you know that sort of um humor and i think 

93.55 94.39 A: uh-huh 

96.55 97.36 A: uh-huh 

97.87 99.76 B: you know in that setting 

99.67 113.42 B: a lot of that can be funny when you're talking amongst your family who you're very comfortable with and they they understand it all but um i think if you're in a large group where you're uncertain of what the composition of the audience is 

104.13 104.95 A: uh-huh 

105.91 107.12 A: yes 

113.36 116.19 B: um that can be a little sticky 

115.95 128.52 A: yeah well then maybe what we're saying is that it's contextual i mean that's what i realise that it it's so what's funny or what's comedy is depending upon the context and who's there 

120.57 121.48 B: right 

128.17 129.04 B: right 

128.45 133.31 A: and i suppose if you go to a club with a comedian who is um 

133.40 135.47 A: very bawdy 

135.73 139.06 A: ah you wouldn't go unless that's what you wanted 

138.86 139.71 B: right 

139.96 151.28 A: so my god have we solved a problem [laughter] i said my god have we solved the problem we've answered it [laughter] [laughter] 

143.17 144.27 B: pardon me 

146.04 154.90 B: yeah right right exactly [laughter] but i i know when i've heard different comedians um like say 

154.85 165.59 B: there are a number of black comedians who are on h._b._o. every once in a while and that type of humor where they're actually making fun of sort of their own if you will 

157.91 159.39 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

165.09 165.97 A: (( uh-huh )) 

165.71 170.11 B: i don't find that entertaining at all i think it's it's dehumanizing you know 

169.38 177.89 A: uh-huh uh-huh well now i guess now i've i've lived in uh i lived in detroit for a long time and a lot of 

176.43 178.89 B: oh i feel sorry for you [laughter] 

177.84 187.07 A: so oh no i loved it yeah i had a lot of a lot of black friends and there's a certain part of that humor where that i think is just a stitch 

186.94 188.74 B: oh right right 

188.27 193.52 A: but but and so it doesn't hit me you know maybe in the same way as it does you so 

192.24 199.11 B: well i think a lot of times it can be sexual and that's the part that i don't like i think that's offensive 

195.46 196.61 A: yeah 

196.80 198.27 A: ah okay 

198.74 199.73 A: yeah 

200.20 208.61 A: yeah well [mn] i guess some some sexual humor i get a charge out of maybe maybe it makes me uncomfortable but i it's like 

204.62 205.82 B: oh sure 

208.63 209.97 A: um 

210.01 210.87 A: but 

211.03 212.57 A: this is i'm just looking 

211.55 217.67 B: again it i think it really depends a lot on the context and the composition of the audience um 

215.11 216.43 A: (( mhm )) 

216.68 217.50 A: uh-huh 

217.73 221.50 B: because um and the and the delivery of the person 

222.23 231.80 B: ah that you're listening to because a lot of times women can do sexual humour and be a lot more entertaining than men and less offensive if you know what i mean 

231.26 236.77 A: i think so yeah yeah i've heard ah well of course it may be who's it's being offensive to 

236.55 237.42 B: right 

236.64 249.71 A: rosie right i was thinking rosie o'donald and there was somebody else that did some st- paul townsend that did some stuff that i felt was really it was it was stretching it but yet it really was funny yeah yeah 

245.64 246.53 B: right 

246.86 248.19 B: yeah 

249.87 250.77 B: [sigh] 

250.68 252.38 A: (( hm [laughter] )) 

251.61 261.71 B: and you know and i occasionally have been to a comedy club 'cause we we have some here um in cleveland in downtown 

257.03 257.83 A: uh-huh 

261.77 262.67 B: um 

263.07 266.60 B: and i think you know a lot of times 

266.93 272.51 B: some of the humor that i think is the most entertaining is the stuff that just talks about everyday life because 

271.72 272.54 A: uh-huh 

272.76 273.96 B: um like 

274.15 284.16 B: based on some of the stuff that y- you would have seen like on seinfeld i mean it was all just about everyday life regular events that happened that can really be very funny 

277.01 279.00 A: (( mhm )) 

280.58 281.86 A: mhm 

282.10 283.34 A: (( mhm )) 

284.31 285.21 B: you know 

284.57 287.62 A: well i think i was thinking of of um 

288.04 292.28 A: (( um gosh that black guy i was thinking um bill cosby )) 

291.94 293.00 B: right 

292.32 302.76 A: who is i mean i thought i think his humor is really really funny and and and but it is so gentle and so focussed on all everyday 

296.83 297.86 B: it is 

302.73 315.65 A: human foibles you know that's that is ah and recently there was a special i didn't see much of it but of bob hope and he was doing his were his were all very contextual to the the servicemen 

303.89 305.11 B: (( right uh-huh )) 

315.59 316.49 B: uh-huh 

315.65 326.53 A: you know the not seeing girls the bombs being dropped nearby you know some of the kinds of stuff that would not be as funny in another context but um 

320.30 321.22 B: right 

326.54 327.95 A: yeah hm 

328.44 336.83 B: and um like i'm thinking about when i was growing up um my parents ah very much liked george carlin 

336.63 337.48 A: uh-huh 

337.05 340.35 B: and he came out with some really sort of um 

340.72 343.63 B: at least you know like in the um 

343.70 345.58 B: th- the late seventies 

345.00 346.23 A: right 

345.59 352.17 B: like the seven words you couldn't say on television and that kind of stuff and and some of his stuff um was 

347.30 350.40 A: right right yes yep yep 

352.18 358.70 B: was i guess they classified as a little racy and you know when i listened to it i thought it was a riot 

354.80 356.00 A: (( yeah )) 

358.35 370.91 A: right well and that's and in a sense part of what he was doing and his i think that sits with his style of humour still is he makes social comments in terms of what he's doing 'cause like the seven words or if that yeah 

366.73 367.66 B: right 

370.69 381.01 A: that that that was really funny i mean it was it was um it was daring at the time but now it's just funny you know um 

376.29 377.22 B: right 

377.35 378.25 B: right 

380.38 386.76 B: right and um dennis miller is another one who i think um he's a very bright guy he 

383.78 384.50 A: (( mm )) 

385.46 386.31 A: uh-huh 

386.61 397.26 B: knows a lot about current events and when he makes fun of situations that you know are a little touchy i still find him very entertaining you know 

393.46 394.23 A: uh-huh 

395.92 407.77 A: mhm mhm mhm well in the same way they are and i'm oh gosh don't tell me i'm going to forget his name the c._b._s. guy who does um um 

408.22 414.41 A: [sigh] [mn] plays the piano and sings as he goes along [mn] russell mark russell 

411.64 412.96 B: oh right 

413.94 414.89 B: okay 

414.45 426.03 A: um he does very topical humor and i it it had gotten to the point i was finding it kind of boring and a friend told me recently oh no his last couple of shows are really picking up so it may have to do with 

426.01 435.82 A: who he's making fun of maybe i appreciate when he's making fun of republicans more [laughter] but uh 

431.00 433.54 B: uh-huh right 

436.07 437.66 A: yeah 

436.96 438.89 B: and you know um 

439.89 448.61 B: through the events of like nine eleven and most recently the war and lot of this you know a lot of the humor that's come out of you know saddam hussein and all that 

448.66 449.53 B: um 

450.41 462.54 B: i'm sure that there there's a segment of the population who would find that sort of humor offensive and um i don't know as as long as it's not slandering anybody it doesn't really bother me 

456.84 459.41 A: (( [mn] )) 

460.72 461.45 A: mhm 

461.83 473.57 A: yeah well the one of the the that's been getting primacy and uh been getting um popularity in britain that um making fun of the iraqi information minister 

473.63 474.59 B: right 

473.70 477.85 A: uh and and those now that really does 

478.15 489.16 A: i mean it it's it does accurately make fun of somebody who is doing an un- unthank- you know unthankful job but um it's really making terribles 

489.46 502.05 A: ah if we cared [laughter] you know terrible terrible could be hurtful but yet it's that isn't that isn't the the the issue for us that it's really rather funny 

491.12 492.85 B: right right 

501.80 502.84 B: right 

502.60 503.19 A: (( [mn] )) 

503.22 511.00 B: and you know some of the stuff that you might see on saturday night live um that that occ- can occasionally border on offensive 

510.59 511.40 A: (( uh-huh )) 

511.17 515.77 B: um i don't know if if you're um a fan of that show or not 

515.12 522.31 A: i used to be i mean i i don't i've looked at it occasionally and i really don't it feels juvenile to me at this point 

516.31 517.34 B: i did didn't 

521.08 527.76 B: right and i think that's part of it like back when they had you know a lot of the more popular 

527.78 534.12 B: comedians that have since moved on and done other things you know like bill murray and gilda radner 

528.55 529.35 A: uh-huh 

530.17 531.00 A: uh-huh 

532.76 535.19 A: uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh 

535.20 542.87 A: well were those more political then or were they just dumb at that time would we have thought they were as dumb at that time as we at least 

541.77 547.42 B: i don't so because i think in ratch- in watching reruns of that area 

545.56 548.10 A: okay but i haven't yeah 

547.93 552.14 B: um which i do on occasion i think that um 

549.62 550.48 A: uh-huh 

553.07 563.44 B: it was a lot more entertaining a lot of the a lot of the things that they choose to do ah their skits on saturday night live now are [mn] it's just meaningless to me 

559.84 560.61 A: uh-huh 

562.46 572.51 A: yeah yeah yeah well i see i'm it's it's it's either it it really does feel junior high scatological you know that stuff [sigh] that kind of stuff so 

568.66 569.61 B: right 

572.78 583.80 A: but uh well i i was thinking of some examples of just from a conversation with at dinner with some neighbors and a person who was here from texas 

583.75 587.97 A: who has a real racist bone in his 

588.01 599.89 A: self and he was making some jokes at a couple of times about people of middle eastern origin and calling them rag heads and nobody challenged him 

588.91 589.90 B: mhm
