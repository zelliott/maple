12.27 13.25 B: yeah

15.72 17.89 A: is it we're 

16.52 17.98 B: yeah it's totally gorgeous 

18.01 22.62 A: we're in for another round of bad storms i'm afraid 

21.81 24.13 B: oh no that that's awful 

23.67 25.38 A: yeah [laughter] 

25.46 26.97 A: so um 

27.09 34.13 A: acceptable humor and what it where do you draw the line for bad taste is that correct 

33.70 34.41 B: (( yep )) 

34.50 35.73 A: okay 

36.00 37.68 A: well do you have any 

37.73 39.38 A: comments 

38.82 46.63 B: i don't know i mean i guess like i could you could start out the conversation i know that there was something sort of strange that happened at work today i had a coworker who 

46.60 54.71 B: um i think everyone feels really comfortable with in general she's usual really sweet and funny and she actually told this joke that i think a lot of people found extremely 

55.06 56.55 B: unpleasant 

56.11 57.09 A: (( oh so )) 

56.52 70.63 B: and it wasn't even really a joke she was just sort of like it was i mean it was sort of meant to be humorous and it sort of had off colored language in it and i think it was like the work environment i didn't find it offensive at all really but i think that a couple of my other coworkers were extremely uncomfortable 

70.83 72.87 B: it was it was really strange 

71.13 71.99 A: so 

72.42 77.54 A: what what did it have in it do y- that you think they oppose to 

77.74 80.56 B: it was a reference to male anatomy [mn] 

80.33 82.10 A: oh okay 

81.44 93.96 B: and it was it was like it was sort of a very like it was definitely not kind of thing that you would generally experience at work but i mean maybe in a different context like at a comedy show or something it would be you wouldn't even be blink 

91.91 92.71 A: mhm 

93.60 95.11 A: mhm 

95.40 96.89 B: [mn] but it was um 

96.92 99.94 B: i know it was a very bizarre situation because i think that 

99.97 102.13 B: she was completely oblivious 

102.06 109.12 A: so um did some of the people that you were around you noticed right away felt up comfortable about that joke 

102.21 103.10 B: (( to )) 

108.83 115.60 B: it seemed like i mean it was it was i and two other people that she had told the joke to and the two other people seemed very uncomfortable 

115.20 118.21 A: mhm what were their 

116.27 117.99 B: and one of them sort of made 

118.27 119.27 B: pardon me 

118.82 121.82 A: what were the ages of the ones that were offended 

120.01 124.37 B: they were fairly were fairly young like one of them was you know 

124.54 129.46 B: in her young late i think early twenties the other was was perhaps in her late twenties they 

129.55 130.36 A: (( mm )) 

130.31 132.76 B: were both fairly young but they 

132.93 144.34 B: seemed just very put off and i would say not in such a way that it would have like affected future interactions with this one coworker of mine but they seemed very uncomfortable at least for that time 

144.81 146.31 B: and that was strange 

145.78 151.41 A: well i can understand that i've had situations like that happen to me before so 

151.22 152.22 B: yeah 

151.67 164.34 A: you know i'm i'm at work and you know one one friend uh thinks a lot like me and another friend doesn't and and a joke was told well i wasn't offended and someone else was so 

163.66 164.76 B: yeah 

164.35 175.82 A: i've seen it happen a lot but what about in the movies what what do you think ah is acceptable humor in a movie and where do you draw the line or bad taste 

175.65 184.89 B: yeah i mean i think that like in general i mean when people go to the movies i think that you know you sort of have certain expectations based on what kind of movie it is you 

184.47 185.62 A: mhm 

184.97 186.33 B: (( know to me i think that )) 

186.67 195.48 B: you know there are some movies that are just you go to them y- you can't possibly expect anything other than jokes in bad taste because that's sort of what they're centered around 

194.95 196.54 A: mhm 

195.78 209.49 B: um and you know and i think that people make decisions about whether or not to go see those depending on whether or not they appreciate that kind of humor but i mean i think it's more that i think it has to do more with like the context and whether or not it's like expected because i think there are some things 

203.24 204.12 A: well that's 

207.85 213.77 A: well this is what happened to me last week when we went uh we saw um anger management 

213.41 214.22 B: uh-huh 

213.76 217.31 A: and um the movie is actually hilarious 

217.05 217.90 B: uh-huh 

217.08 230.23 A: pretty much i mean for the most part it's pretty funny but there's a a spot in it that um you know i didn't think was humorous at all and i thought was darn right disgusting and it was a a lesbian scene 

227.61 228.57 B: yeah 

230.16 242.26 A: and um you know other people in the audience i could hear them laughing and and it just totally embarrassed me because you know i'm just ah i'm really straight you know that that just 

234.32 235.32 B: mhm 

240.31 241.32 B: uh-huh 

242.26 245.57 A: you know just cuts me the wrong way and i had my 

245.40 256.74 A: my ah eleven year old daughter with me and and it was p._g. thirteen and she sees ah movies that you know she's a real mature girl and she doesn't mind some 

256.57 264.47 A: you know off the wall stuff but you know when it gets right down vulgar you know i we we got up and left 

256.80 258.11 B: (( mhm )) 

264.44 265.60 B: oh yeah 

265.05 268.72 A: that's that's where i kind of drew the line there because 

267.25 279.69 B: well i mean i think it especially makes sense if you have a child with you and i mean that's what i was talking about like your expectations if you go to a movie and you just sort of expect to have you know a good time and not be confronted with something that's unpleasant or that you know 

278.75 287.16 A: mhm and and like i knew it was gonna be p._g. thirteen and i knew it was gonna be humorous and i knew there was gonna be some off the wall stuff but 

279.93 281.54 B: you weren't sort of expecting 

287.05 300.75 A: ah having a lesbian scene in it just totally blew my mind i mean i did not expect it and and it really it you know it offended my daughter and so you know well we did the right thing we left 

291.29 292.18 B: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

297.07 298.11 B: yeah 

300.21 308.61 B: oh yeah absolutely and i think i mean that's what that's what people generally should do when they find themselves in the circumstance where they just don't find it funny they should just sort of remove themselves 

308.64 320.00 B: from the situation i think it makes a statement and it also just sort of eliminates the the conflict because i mean people have such v- vastly differing senses of humor that 

320.17 327.44 B: i mean it just i think that you can't really predict what one person or another person is going to like find funny or find downright offensive 

327.08 327.90 A: right 

327.42 337.50 B: and i i think the best thing to do is like make sure that it's clear from the outset like what you're ex- like what the expectations should be so you know if a movie's going to have humor in it that's just you know sort of 

328.00 328.74 A: i 

337.92 345.48 B: you know that that could be construed as being offensive then it should be sort of more clear before you are actually sitting in the movie if that might be the case 

344.63 349.50 A: i i agree totally ah give me one second [noise] 

348.59 349.54 B: oh sure 

351.04 352.86 A: are you wearing that tonight [noise] 

353.88 356.52 A: why do you want to go out and get it dirty now [noise] 

356.54 363.91 A: okay you got thirty minutes and you be back here i'm sorry i i i my my daughter's got company 

360.34 362.20 B: oh no that's okay [noise] 

363.99 366.97 A: and they want they were asking me a question 

366.77 368.45 B: oh that's fine no worries 

367.89 368.94 A: [laughter] 

369.24 375.60 A: okay so back to ah what else would you ah other than the movies ah 

374.68 383.79 B: i mean i think that there i think there are some cases where things just are downright appro- inappropriate and i think that's like if they malign like you know certain groups of people 

383.57 396.59 B: or you know make light of things that are like genuinely serious issues like serious illnesses or something like that like i think that in general those kinds of humor can be just really offensive and not really very funny 

396.27 397.20 A: yeah 

396.61 397.41 B: i mean 

397.50 401.55 B: i mean i think that there are there are certain lines that usually like can't be crossed 

401.71 409.08 B: and and i don't that think it's funny when people try to but you know making fun of someone having cancer is just not like it's not a good joke 

408.66 409.59 A: no 

409.29 417.01 B: or you know you know making fun of like ethnic groups i don't think makes for good jokes either i think that's offensive enough 

415.45 418.42 A: right or if somebody's weight you know 

417.66 421.38 B: right or someone's yeah exactly exactly that kinda thing [sigh] i mean 

419.34 420.78 A: right 

421.71 432.37 B: i think especially when there's a potential for harm like if it's gonna hurt someone's feelings or like or something like that that it's just [mn] you know it really removes humor from the situation it's just not funny any more 

431.15 434.17 A: right common sense should tell you where to draw the line 

434.02 441.30 B: yeah exactly and then that's something i think that is more universal like it doesn't really matter what circumstance you're in it's just not appropriate 

435.38 436.34 A: mhm 

441.93 445.87 A: what about [sigh] over the internet do you have internet service 

445.72 447.75 B: yeah definitely 

446.56 447.34 A: (( ah )) 

447.36 452.71 A: you know some of the things that come out over the internet i find a little offensive too you know 

452.02 458.73 B: [laughter] well see in the stuff on the internet there's there are things on the internet that are more offensive than like anything else and i think it's just because people 

457.00 461.88 A: i a lot of spam a lot of spamming a 

459.70 461.03 B: so much 

461.04 466.04 B: oh yeah definitely i know i get things with my email that are offensive [laughter] 

462.55 463.55 A: (( lot of spam and and )) 

466.09 469.63 B: i mean really offensive i mean 

466.44 475.89 A: um i do too i get kind of ah tired of deleting ah emails all the time from from crap places you know 

475.20 478.74 B: i know i know i know it's really upsetting because [mn] 

478.78 488.56 B: no it's just you're like flooded with them and then some of them are just like disturbing or unpleasant i mean if you're like at work and you get some junk mail that's got like 

483.59 484.91 A: mhm 

488.53 495.47 B: you know it's got nudity in it like that's completely inappropriate and i don't know why that should ever happen it really upsets me 

494.71 506.64 A: i think they're trying to bra- um crack down on a lot of that stuff over the internet but um i think overall it's gonna be really hard to you know not see it because of freedom of speech and stuff 

506.02 511.79 B: yeah and there's no real way to regulate the internet effectively like or at least there isn't at this point 

511.24 524.01 A: yeah i don't think so either but i wish there were because um you know you pay a lot of money for ah i don't have one yet but you know like um ah blocking systems block certain um 

511.80 512.55 B: so 

512.95 515.01 B: people are only left to their own devices 

521.57 522.76 B: yeah 

524.03 536.43 A: um emails and p- poor language and stuff like that or nudity there's ah um but you know those are those are expensive to purchase them 

526.70 527.87 B: right 

534.92 540.97 B: oh i know i know and that's the thing the the burden shouldn't be on people who don't wanna see those things 

540.92 549.93 B: i mean it shouldn't be that like just because you don't wanna have to be inundated with inappropriate things in your email you should have to pay money to have that not happen 

549.45 551.18 A: oh exactly 

550.07 552.53 B: because that just seems so backwards 

552.08 558.49 A: yep i i agree with that i really do i don't think we should have to have that burden but ah 

557.00 562.41 B: no i mean it's just really unfair because i mean we didn't ask to be sent those things 

558.57 559.21 A: (( you )) 

562.97 571.45 A: know if somebody wants to see that stuff let them get on their own database you know um so keep us out of it 

567.99 569.86 B: yeah definitely 

571.33 578.72 B: oh i know i know that's the thing i mean it should be the choice of the like the individual to to find that kind of thing not just have it like be put upon you 

580.09 593.29 A: ah i saw something come over the internet not too long ago and it was you could tell it was definitely pornographic and it was geared towards little girls or little children and 

580.39 581.22 B: so 

587.87 588.98 B: mhm 

590.65 591.93 B: no 

592.48 593.61 B: you're kidding 

593.33 599.64 A: no and it came up about that quick you know and and i deleted it and i didn't think was funny at all it was 

598.93 599.89 B: that has to be ille-
