0.83 2.68 B: hi this is jackie 

3.46 5.72 A: hi this is justine how are you 

5.39 6.88 B: i'm good how are you 

6.81 8.40 A: good [laughter] 

7.66 8.84 B: [laughter] 

9.57 21.66 A: so i guess the topic is comedy and how um [noise] how to differentiate between um comedy in good taste and good humor and bad humor is that correct 

21.36 22.84 B: right 

22.24 24.22 A: okay um 

24.44 28.38 A: i guess the first thing that comes to my mind is um 

28.48 33.43 A: when um the late night shows were debating between like 

33.62 36.08 A: how to incorporate um 

36.32 42.32 A: the war in iraq into their um you know t._v. shows and their comedies 

37.68 38.54 B: right 

42.62 47.89 A: so um i guess i would say they did it pretty well and um 

48.38 54.72 A: you know they sort of supported the troops and you know didn't really make fun of the president and [mn] 

53.96 58.65 B: exactly they did- you're right that's a really good example where 

58.61 69.62 B: with there's a lot of different sensitive iss- issues i think i started to read like you have different gender issues you have different culture issues that like people talk about all the time and try to joke about 

69.34 70.40 A: right 

69.62 74.76 B: but i think when it wh- lately ever since like nine eleven and now with the war 

74.72 75.72 A: right 

75.40 84.94 B: i think they've done a really good job also because i mean it it's a very sensitive issue i mean especially when it comes to politics but there's so many people involved 

80.75 81.85 A: yeah 

84.86 86.96 A: right right 

85.27 86.06 B: you know 

86.10 89.10 B: some people with their own political views that i think 

89.54 92.50 B: um that that is a good example with um 

92.57 96.13 B: as far as humor and and good and good taste 

95.74 101.79 A: right yeah i think so too um and i just other issues sort of um 

102.21 104.03 A: you know if if 

104.14 107.66 A: a comedian uses racial or ethnic 

107.15 108.61 B: right 

107.90 109.79 A: or um 

110.30 112.22 A: religious jokes 

112.49 114.27 A: i mean i guess 

114.86 120.69 A: that's a lot a part of comedy i mean it's a huge part of comedy i mean 

120.31 121.69 B: part of comedy 

121.14 125.16 A: you know if you have a jewish comed- comedian he's usually 

125.74 137.68 A: you know incorporates his own religion into it or you know a black comedian incorporates his heritage so i think if if the comedian uses 

129.58 130.67 B: (( exactly )) 

138.29 140.79 A: i mean his background 

140.00 143.99 B: right it does reflect on their own experience i find 

142.34 143.03 A: (( [sigh] )) 

143.75 144.86 A: yeah 

144.28 151.32 B: i mean i think there are a lot of people that i've seen that have you know at least tried to use some type of 

152.16 159.37 B: i mean they've done it you know being very careful to not offend anybody um a lot of a lot of the um 

154.89 155.82 A: right 

156.74 157.91 A: right 

159.76 165.38 B: the racial humor that i've seen has come from people of that same background and i agree with it 

164.64 165.50 A: right 

165.86 168.33 A: yeah i mean you'll never 

168.34 171.17 A: you'll never really see like you know 

171.37 172.48 A: um 

172.67 180.41 A: you know like a-a white jewish comedian making fun of um like a black comedian for instance you know 

179.64 181.39 B: (( right exactly )) 

180.74 183.62 A: i don't think it really works that way um 

183.19 191.64 B: i don't think anyone's bold enough now especially with the way people have started to identify more with living in america and being american or 

191.27 192.54 A: right 

191.73 197.58 B: own like like cultural or racial backgrounds i think people are starting to take that a little bit more seriously 

197.78 199.47 A: (( yeah i agree )) 

199.25 208.85 B: even on that i guess on that note it just seems like people there's there's a lot i think people are really care- more careful now as far as humor um 

208.90 209.82 B: you know 

210.11 214.52 B: portraying it or depicting it more in in good taste than bad taste 

214.34 216.80 A: yeah i would say so um 

217.11 219.34 A: i mean i don't know like 

219.74 224.84 A: [mn] hm i guess so like i'm thinking back to maybe comedy 

224.87 230.15 A: um you know from ten years ago or twenty years ago or thirty years ago 

230.28 234.07 A: and i don't know how it was necessarily different or 

234.67 236.94 A: better or worse um 

236.98 245.80 B: i don't think it was discussed as much i remember growing up where um it took me to go to college to realise that archie bunker there was a lot of people that took 

245.36 246.33 A: mhm 

246.15 260.20 B: you know sense of humor and um what he you know what he portrayed as comedy as offensive and i grew up in a household where um it was just looked at as comedy you know i think there was a lot of underlying things back in the day 

260.18 261.56 B: that people but 

260.40 263.91 A: right right right that weren't obvious um 

262.79 266.63 B: it wasn't talked about as much as it is modern day i i'd 

266.06 267.17 A: that's true 

266.96 273.95 B: say people are more open t- t- to talk about it and i think maybe that's what triggers them too more careful in how 

274.38 287.43 B: they voice their opinion on it or how they even just you know make mention of it i mean even to bring it up in a conversation i think that that people are a lot more careful and i mean they're more open about it but they're a lot they i mean they use 

286.83 292.43 A: right right i guess with openness comes like sensitivity and 

292.44 298.57 A: um you know i guess political correctness and and all that so 

293.00 293.78 B: (( yes yes )) 

293.96 295.05 B: liberatedness 

299.11 303.20 A: i mean hopefully it it sort of stays that way i mean 

302.69 304.75 B: yeah i do i hope so i 

303.28 304.12 A: it's 

304.52 305.59 A: yeah 

305.45 312.26 B: mean some people use just um as far as comedy and that they they they want it to be entertainment 

312.41 313.32 A: right 

312.72 314.31 B: but i mean 

315.41 321.22 B: i don't know it's just all in the matter of like i guess who the audience is you know what i'm saying 

320.95 329.87 A: right yeah it definitely depends like how sensitive the audience is like you know if if someone can take a joke then 

321.57 322.32 B: (( like if )) 

329.89 335.89 A: something might not seem offensive to them that is offensive to someone else you know 

335.45 336.94 B: right i agree 

336.29 340.70 A: um so i guess it depends on who the person is whether 

340.79 346.64 A: what their perception is of um you know the comedian's purpose like 

346.00 347.16 B: right 

347.24 351.47 A: if you know y- it might be obvious that the comedian is 

351.78 359.40 A: making a certain point just in good fun or you know it might be more sarcastic or something like that 

354.98 355.90 B: right 

358.53 359.59 B: right 

359.51 360.54 A: um 

360.97 365.62 A: i know of um a friend that saw a comedy show and 

365.69 366.74 A: um 

367.06 370.64 A: a person was disabled and h- and he was sort of making 

370.71 372.36 A: fun of himself 

371.92 373.67 B: oh wow mhm 

373.00 378.09 A: yeah and so it was like i mean i wasn't there but i can imagine like 

378.45 382.79 A: you know at first you might not even want to laugh because 

382.06 383.01 B: right 

382.90 385.15 A: you're just socially 

385.46 388.62 A: aware of you know not offending 

388.90 394.46 A: people with disabilities and and um but i mean i guess 

394.43 404.16 A: you know like if he's comfortable enough doing it and and he obviously wants people to laugh at him and and or not at him necessarily but with him 

400.67 401.52 B: right 

403.79 404.72 B: right 

404.63 406.26 A: so um 

405.77 417.73 B: [mn] to bring a funny side to it 'cause that's i think that's another sens- sensitive issue people that are disabled or people that have gone through certain sufferings in their life you know what i'm saying 

408.40 409.28 A: uh-huh 

417.71 425.73 B: it's for them to stand up and and talk about it and bring humor to it i think sometimes some people think that that's a way for them to 

417.74 418.81 A: right 

421.80 423.16 A: right 

425.81 429.87 B: be more comfortable about whatever it is that they're going through you know emotionally 

429.18 430.41 A: that's true 

430.88 434.02 A: that's true if you can't laugh about i mean 

433.38 444.30 B: exactly exactly i mean i think that comedy does bring bring humor to a lot of things that most people are very uncomfortable with or even uncomfortable talking about 

434.57 435.49 A: it's 

435.58 437.17 A: might not be worth it 

443.71 444.78 A: right 

444.32 445.67 B: so um 

446.99 455.19 B: i don't know like i-i don't know i enjoy comedy i'm i'm like i like slapstick comedy you know what i'm saying i like all different types of comedy 

454.57 460.26 A: yeah i do too and i don't i don't really find anything offensive um 

460.27 467.82 A: because i think most comedy is just you know for the purpose like entertainment and 

467.19 468.04 B: (( exactly )) 

467.81 476.15 A: making people laugh and en- en- you know enjoying you know what they're seeing so how can it really have any 

470.91 471.88 B: right 

473.38 474.26 B: right 

476.65 477.70 A: (( i mean )) 

478.88 482.18 A: for the most part i guess there there might be some 

482.50 486.13 A: some people i've never you know seen them that 

486.56 497.23 A: um it's not in good taste but um for the most part i think everything i've seen is is pretty um pretty you know friendly and 

496.50 501.87 B: i i agree i mean it's something that you can relate to and laugh at and leave it at that where you don't 

501.21 502.34 A: right 

501.70 512.87 B: go away you know thinking about well why would they say something like that or why would they do something like that i mean it's been a long time since i've heard anything you know what i'm saying or seen anything myself 

513.35 514.74 B: so i mean 

515.55 517.89 B: i guess for the most part um 

518.09 519.86 A: yeah um 

519.41 520.40 B: i don't know 

521.34 524.12 A: [laughter] i wonder what else we should talk about ah 

523.15 526.94 B: i know i don't know what else they want us to get from this conversation um 

528.53 535.03 B: i don't know and it just seems like even as far as comedy and good taste and bad taste it comes in so many different forms i mean it's 

534.44 535.73 A: yeah 

535.00 541.63 B: not just stand up comics any more it's with television shows it's with movies it's with i think 

540.64 541.82 A: that's true 

541.52 555.65 B: it just branches off into so many other avenues i mean even on the radio they have um like some of the radio stations that i listen to where i am you know they have little excerpts where there are people that come on with like a little scheme or whatever 

555.53 556.53 A: right 

556.35 566.25 B: and it is it's a matter of just you know again bringing humor to something as far as promoting a product or i mean even in commercials there's comedy there's humor 

565.66 567.88 A: right that's true 

566.49 573.47 B: you know and i mean it is an attention getter i mean as far as being entertaining it does get your attention and i think 

572.93 574.27 A: oh definitely 

573.84 579.37 B: ah for people to be made aware of things that they may not even pay any attention to a lot of times 

579.37 580.88 A: right right 

579.76 580.59 B: you know 

580.99 585.11 A: and it can be subtle or i mean it can be obvious so 

584.08 584.83 B: it can 

585.23 587.37 A: um i guess you know 

587.41 592.27 A: it depends how much you read into it and and all that too 

590.45 591.14 B: (( yeah )) 

591.92 592.98 B: (( [mn] so )) 

593.25 594.39 A: um 

594.59 597.16 A: i guess ah what was i going to say 

598.44 599.95 A: or even like you know
