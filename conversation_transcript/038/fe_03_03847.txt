1.72 3.64 A: hi i'm alice 

4.44 7.46 B: hi i've never done this before do we just start talking [sigh] 

7.13 16.53 A: oh i guess so um i guess they want us to like um what did they say to differentiate between like acceptable comedy and comedy that's not acceptable 

16.00 19.32 B: right what do you do when someone makes a bad joke i guess 

18.66 22.97 A: [sigh] [laughter] yes well lots of times i um just turn to um 

22.98 35.21 A: turn the turn the station to another the t._v. to another station because i'm not really into a lot of um of the jokes that they have on t._v. if they're in poor taste to me that really isn't funny 

35.10 42.18 B: [sigh] i experience it more like when my friends might say something that i don't feel is funny 

42.20 56.85 B: and then what do i do and i i tend to just kind of ignore it and go away and try hopefully that that was just a once in a [sigh] a one instance if they start making a lot of bad jokes i just kind of tend not to hang out with them 

56.68 61.85 A: mhm well what type of comedies do you normally watch on television 

61.68 68.03 B: on television what do i normally watch h._b._o. or television shows that are kind of funny 

66.92 73.20 A: yes are there any comedies that you find offensive or in poor taste that are that are on t._v. 

73.17 77.54 B: [sigh] [sigh] ah i'm pretty open to comedy so i don't know 

77.58 81.78 B: if i would there's some i don't understand or relate to 

81.97 96.52 B: um i suppose some for a target market that would be away from my home where i grew up in new jersey which um we probably had about two african american people in my you know neighbourhood and after i moved to new york i 

96.48 106.32 B: understand a lot more of the jokes i get a lot more but you know things that i probably wouldn't watch are like moesha things like that 'cause i don't think it's i get it you know more 

98.85 99.83 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

106.04 106.81 A: (( [sigh] yes )) 

106.36 109.33 B: or i feel kind of dumb [laughter] if i don't get the joke 

107.80 108.70 A: well 

109.19 117.80 A: well i really do like like different kinds of comedy and lots of times like i do find the the comedies where they feature black families 

117.57 125.25 A: um i find them very funny well maybe it's because i'm a teacher and you know like i- i sort of identify 

125.33 130.97 A: um a lot of the things that happen on these ah that happen on the shows with the kids 

127.54 129.12 B: oh that's good 

131.01 143.88 A: but um i don't really find too many like offensive like i think family matters is kind of wholesome and it's it's an older um comedy but i watch all the reruns [laughter] and 

143.97 150.09 A: i'm trying to think of the one that's really funny um the with um with j._j. remember that one 

149.60 155.30 B: oh and okay now wait a minute then so i'm wrong when i say that i don't understand some because that was funny 

152.68 159.24 A: oh that was good times so that's right oh it was good times and it's very clean humor and ah 

157.85 161.86 B: yeah i enjoyed that i think that was also one of my first 

161.93 162.89 B: um 

163.38 172.10 B: i guess experiences with you know with black humour in in in when i was a kid you know something kind of kind of on the edge it was funny 

164.76 165.70 A: uh-huh 

171.70 173.02 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

172.55 175.01 B: what else seinfeld i like 

173.19 174.00 A: yeah 

174.60 180.49 A: yes well that's that's good they well once in a while i i don't know i you know i never really watch seinfeld 

180.53 181.72 A: but um 

182.21 195.30 A: until all the reruns came on and once in a while they say some things on there but you know i um i can cope with that [laughter] [laughter] but th- they are kind of funny i guess also it depends upon like what we was talking about before 

189.54 190.24 B: [laughter] 

195.29 205.85 A: like how you grow grew up and like what part of the united states you grew you grew up in and what your family was like and what type of um television programs they exposed you to 

205.45 207.71 B: where am i speaking to by the way 

207.12 209.53 A: okay i live in hollywood florida 

209.06 212.01 B: oh really oh my parents are near there how funny 

211.52 213.55 A: oh okay [laughter] 

212.36 213.87 B: i know the area well 

213.56 214.52 A: uh-huh 

215.20 216.61 A: um i'm trying 

215.84 222.26 B: and how did you find out about this study i know we're going to talk about the comedy in a minute but i'm just dying to know well it's the first time i'm doing this 

219.64 223.35 A: yes [laughter] well on the on the internet from um 

223.70 232.07 A: you know from somebody who had a post on a message board but [laughter] but anyway we'd better get back to the comedy that's what what they're listening for um 

226.10 227.44 B: okay um 

228.71 230.50 B: oh okay 

232.29 237.81 A: um i'm trying to think of like other comedies that i watch like on t._v. but um 

237.41 240.18 B: was it specific to comedy on t._v. 

240.29 244.40 A: um well i don't know it's any kind of comedy i guess but it's 

244.12 246.19 B: have you been to comedy shows 

245.99 256.93 A: um yes like i yes i do i go to comedy shows um sometimes but lots of the humour it takes a lot to make me he laugh and any time there's something that's raunchy 

256.77 258.14 B: [laughter] 

256.92 261.18 A: like certain comedians i really don't like care for 

259.60 260.57 B: right 

260.61 263.23 B: like curse words or things like that 

261.69 267.06 A: yes like the curse words and because i don't find that's funny like a lot of people do find 

266.88 278.93 A: that type of comedy like very funny you see these people and they're like falling off the chair [laughter] but i'm looking at them and i don't find it you know very um you know funny at all 

279.14 294.01 B: yeah uh i mean i-i think there's like typical humour there's like men humour i call it guy humor where there's a lot of like flatulence jokes and comedy and english humor where there's a lot of physical comedy and more flatulence [laughter] [laughter] 

291.62 299.90 A: uh-huh well i'll tell you that's exactly that's exactly what i don't like when they talk about flatulence it makes me kind of uncomfortable 

294.02 295.27 B: i'm not into it 

298.04 299.90 B: [laughter] 

300.18 301.94 B: yeah not my thing you know 

300.18 304.51 A: well i know if we were watching the like the movie you know the eddie murphy 

304.14 305.39 B: mhm 

304.57 307.68 A: movie where they were sitting at the table 

307.64 319.06 A: and you know the professor the the nutty professor they had it on t._v. the other day and i love eddie murphy and you know i know that he's kind of raunchy [laughter] but i love i like like 

309.59 310.78 B: the nutty professor 

310.90 311.89 B: uh-huh 

318.98 326.82 A: like when they had the movie um trading places like i thought he was very funny in that and i do like like to laugh a lot and 

322.02 322.90 B: mhm 

326.85 333.59 A: you know but but if it's but if it's the humour that's something off color i i don't really find it very funny [laughter] mhm mhm 

333.13 345.81 B: well yeah there's not you know nothing funny about that to me it's just a horrible thing [laughter] but they love it i mean i don't know i like intelligent humor i think i liked saturday night live when it was more political 

345.88 359.00 B: because i just love when things are exposed for what they really are and i think sometimes comedy can create an opening where people are afraid to say something and i love when comedy just sort of cuts through it 

349.81 350.66 A: uh-huh 

358.39 359.50 A: (( uh-huh mhm yes )) 

358.90 362.06 B: but when you know if they say something you don't agree with 

362.05 369.84 B: um that's always kind of difficult but i suppose you have to respect their opinion but you know usually in new york when you go to a comedy club 

369.80 380.89 B: there's maybe six or seven on the lineup so you kind of like hope that the next one's better and you kind of feel embarrassed for the one who's kind of dying out there or or you just kind of like hope somebody'll be funnier [sigh] 

380.35 389.94 A: yes who's your favorite comedian as far as like what you've seen on t._v. and like what do you consider to be like a comedian that you really enjoy watching mhm 

388.60 392.46 B: okay when i was a kid i was in love with steve martin 

392.56 396.73 B: i still am kind of um i love eddie murphy 

396.55 397.59 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

397.02 400.24 B: but the older stuff like saturday night live stuff 

400.31 401.51 B: um 

401.73 404.76 B: um who do i like right now um 

404.95 411.16 B: um um oh my gosh i guess i like seinfeld i like t._v. shows like friends and seinfeld 

408.74 409.47 A: yes 

409.62 414.97 A: yes i've really learned to appreciate that you know i don't really like friends that much see friends i don't find 

414.98 425.19 A: you know very humorous i don't see what people see in friends [laughter] or why it's so funny i turn it off if i have nothing else to watch i mean i'll watch it but it's not offensive in any way but um 

416.22 417.10 B: mhm 

418.68 420.07 B: oh really i do 

420.08 421.04 B: [laughter] 

425.18 432.24 B: i love it because i can relate to it i think that's probably the you know comedy that that offends me usually isn't that 'cause it's kind of 

427.95 429.43 A: yeah yeah 

431.78 432.86 A: yeah 

432.42 435.55 B: but what's comedy that offends me oh you know who offended me 

435.21 436.06 A: who 

436.07 437.51 B: andrew dice clay 

437.20 452.04 A: oh yes definitely whenever i saw him on t._v. i know like lots of times i've gone to vegas and i've seen the big billboards up that he's going to be performing and i know i've seen him in some shows and he had a comedy out i think and [sigh] i would not watch that 'cause 

437.97 439.40 B: [laughter] 

439.61 441.18 B: [laughter] 

445.91 446.90 B: uh-huh 

451.84 458.61 A: like anybody who i don't find anything funny about like his humour at all [laughter] i mean his comedy act at all [sigh] 

456.38 462.14 B: [sigh] yes his comedy is just about yelling what about um sam kennison 

462.18 463.43 B: do you remember him 

462.47 469.01 A: oh well i know but then he passed away i know like yeah he did but he was he was ki- he was very loud he was on that 

464.48 466.87 B: oh i guess [mn] he screamed 

468.97 479.74 A: on on a show i think with um on a movie with rodney dangerfield who is one of my favorite comedians of all time back to school he was on that when he was yelling he was one of the teachers 

474.31 475.74 B: oh is that your favorite 

479.16 480.13 B: mhm 

479.84 481.71 A: (( and sam kennison )) 

481.79 487.74 A: he's he's funny but i- i don't know i find him a little loud and maybe offensive to me in that way you 

487.90 495.19 A: know 'cause i like somebody who's very clean humor that's the kind of humor that i like and like i said the way i was brought up mhm mhm 

494.86 508.94 B: right right well america's different than hollywood florida i guess but i tend to be not religious so i don't mind religious comedy i think it's kind of fun because things can get so serious out there and political humor i like but stuff like um 

509.28 515.24 B: who's that guy who has kind of a funny voice not ercole like but sort of similar 

513.97 520.66 A: oh i know what you mean eddy i-i know who i know exactly he has the dark hair rodney something is his name rodney
