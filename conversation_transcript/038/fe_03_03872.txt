68.22 69.16 A: right 

69.15 72.37 B: and i agree if it's going to hurt somebody 

72.67 75.11 B: then uh i don't like it 

74.76 78.03 A: well i think also is age appropriation 

77.74 78.81 B: mhm 

78.82 81.23 A: (( if it's appropriate for )) 

78.93 80.26 B: definitely 

83.00 85.99 A: for whom the comedy is 

84.40 85.47 B: right 

86.09 87.96 A: whether it's a movie or 

87.58 89.00 B: mhm 

88.62 89.81 A: radio 

90.09 93.26 B: have you watched um women comedians 

93.40 94.15 A: yes 

94.20 103.55 B: they really seem to put themselves down i don't know if that's just me watching it but women seem to put themselves more down than men do in comedy 

102.07 103.21 A: they do 

103.49 105.08 A: whether it's their 

106.75 109.93 A: their and it seems weight is the big issue 

109.58 112.15 B: right the way they look um 

111.42 112.74 A: mhm 

112.64 118.02 B: just everything um one that really effects me i think her name is sarah 

119.98 121.61 B: or something like that 

120.92 124.67 A: oh i know who you mean and i can't remember i i know 

124.37 129.21 B: yeah yeah um i find her just totally offensive 

128.63 132.30 A: i do too i i do too and 

133.58 136.04 B: but then there's like bill cosby 

136.73 139.07 B: who is just totally funny to me 

138.43 139.64 A: mhm 

140.36 143.76 B: he spoke at my son's college graduation 

143.67 145.01 A: oh 

144.50 146.70 B: [laughter] 

145.68 149.65 A: he he's and he everything is in good taste 

148.84 151.87 B: everything's good taste just like 

150.60 151.42 A: and 

152.95 154.08 A: mhm 

155.59 158.42 A: and i think again has to be 

160.54 163.99 A: age appropriate and some comedians are 

164.22 167.23 A: vulgar and i like bernie mac 

167.61 169.43 B: i've never watched him 

169.41 179.80 A: um his comedy i've seen his program on t._v. but his comedy is it's very good it's very he's not putting anyone down 

179.23 180.38 B: mhm 

180.95 182.13 A: and 

185.07 188.70 B: my brother he can get anybody laughing 

188.82 195.50 B: and he doesn't make if you know him you know that it's not meant 

195.55 199.67 B: to offend anybody but everybody is fair game 

196.63 197.89 A: mhm 

199.82 200.96 A: [laughter] 

200.27 206.95 B: [laughter] you know it's just everybody is fair game with my brother

210.79 212.13 A: good humour 

211.58 214.37 B: yeah good humour and um 

214.05 218.80 A: and i think that's important i think it's important that we can look at ourselves and laugh 

218.16 226.11 B: mhm people i think take themselves too seriously and are so afraid of being politically correct 

225.38 230.18 A: politically correct but i think when we cross the line and we're hurting people 

229.58 230.83 B: right 

232.83 234.82 A: to me that's unacceptable 

234.21 239.50 B: oh it is and no matter whether it's comedy or just plain old comment 

239.20 240.35 A: mhm 

241.60 246.79 A: exactly and i don't know if it's age or what but what 

245.59 246.91 B: mhm
