0.42 2.47 A: hi my name's wendy 

2.18 3.63 B: oh i'm kim 

3.51 5.14 A: oh hi kim how are you 

4.78 5.89 B: (( good how are you )) 

5.59 7.17 A: i'm fine thanks 

7.35 16.76 A: uh i guess the topic today is comedy and where you draw the line between good taste and bad taste uh any ideas [laughter] 

14.08 15.09 B: yeah 

16.26 20.11 B: [laughter] kind of struck me off guard there um 

18.88 19.68 A: (( oh )) 

19.95 24.77 A: is this your first time or oh i've done one before this is my second time 

21.13 22.33 B: yeah 

24.89 25.98 A: (( so )) 

26.44 29.68 B: okay um do you have any thoughts at all 

29.75 39.02 A: well let's see i think as far as good taste and bad taste goes i think especially in the workplace you have to be extremely careful 

39.06 51.78 A: as far as uh humour goes um because a lot of times you don't know people that you work with that well and uh i think it would be really easy to offend somebody 

51.94 57.20 B: yeah then you have to make sure that you don't say anything that uh would definitely offend your boss 

56.94 59.60 A: (( exactly [laughter] )) 

58.56 60.85 B: you wouldn't want to get on their bad side 

60.29 63.56 A: right whoever's writing you pay cheque especially 

62.79 64.09 B: right [laughter] 

63.66 66.52 A: [laughter] right and then i think um 

67.10 75.50 A: bad taste of course would be any adult humour around children i think would be bad taste 

74.73 76.64 B: (( yes agree with that )) 

76.61 78.82 A: right um 

78.71 79.60 B: (( [noise] )) 

79.94 91.64 A: i i think it just really depends on how well you know the person uh that you're around or the people that you're around and uh i think when in doubt um 

92.26 94.64 A: don't tell that joke [laughter] 

95.07 97.06 B: yeah i i agree too 

97.01 98.24 A: oh okay 

97.73 98.81 B: yeah 

100.12 102.47 A: did you have any other thoughts or 

103.03 104.10 B: um 

105.22 110.14 B: probably could uh bring t._v. into it as well certain programs certain different 

110.23 111.50 B: comedies with 

111.56 112.32 B: (( like )) 

112.60 113.84 B: south park 

114.11 115.85 A: oh exactly 

115.18 120.18 B: cartoons like that i mean it's geared more towards children but not necessarily appropriate 

120.53 121.52 B: (( some of them )) 

120.74 127.48 A: that that's true i i myself really enjoy watching south park but i have an eight year old son and 

121.65 122.23 B: (( right )) 

127.61 131.58 A: that's something i don't watch until he's asleep at night 

130.84 138.64 B: exactly yeah i would i would be even even younger kids or maybe even a little bit older you don't ever want to expose them to 

138.69 140.66 B: things like that and 

140.41 148.57 A: right and that you bring up a good point because it does seem the way the characters are written and stuff that it really is 

148.76 149.71 A: uh 

150.55 153.78 A: younger children can be very attracted to it 

153.33 155.32 B: right right and 

154.52 157.24 A: when that really is not appropriate for them 

157.01 160.74 B: right and uh that's even on cartoons network isn't it 

161.08 162.68 A: the south park 

162.09 163.47 B: yeah 

162.80 165.27 A: uh i think it's comedy central 

164.55 166.95 B: oh comedy central yeah 

165.86 166.78 A: right 

167.39 171.45 A: i know my son watches a lot of programs on nickelodeon 

170.90 171.98 B: uh-huh 

171.48 177.56 A: and uh but we really monitor his t._v. programming channels 

177.29 178.57 B: right 

177.87 184.74 A: even on regular network t._v. there's a lot of comedies that i wouldn't consider appropriate even something 

184.83 192.13 A: that would come on like at eight o'clock like will and grace or even the simpsons i i don't 

188.38 189.63 B: mhm 

192.56 193.62 B: yeah 

192.57 196.92 A: really want my children [noise] at this point in time to be watching 

196.86 204.45 B: i have an eight month old and my husband watches the simpsons and even though he is only eight months i still i mean he loves watching it cause of the colors 

204.20 205.02 A: uh-huh 

204.47 211.69 B: and stuff like that of course how kids are but uh i don't like him being around and catching you know some of the words and 

211.27 215.59 A: right when he's getting to the point that he's learning how to speak [laughter] 

214.48 217.92 B: right you don't want his first words to be inappropriate 

217.43 222.04 A: right yeah i have a um almost a twenty one month old 

221.86 222.84 B: (( mhm )) 

222.25 223.52 A: (( and uh )) 

223.53 231.42 A: we uh got a couple of little south park like stuffed doll things and uh at the flea market 

230.97 232.06 B: (( mhm )) 

231.28 238.64 A: my husband and i and we put them way up where she couldn't get to them and she's always pointing wanting to take them down and play with them 

239.37 244.10 B: yeah they're a lot of the images are geared for to interest children like that 

244.13 248.25 A: right and like you said the bright colors exactly 

244.76 245.95 B: the colors 

247.43 251.40 B: right that's always grabs a baby or child's attention 

251.47 252.54 A: right 

254.72 261.11 A: but um this is kind of an interesting topic i didn't know really where to start [laughter] 

260.13 263.92 B: yeah i kind of wasn't expecting something like this but uh 

264.28 274.26 A: right yeah it would be interesting to find out what they use all of this for uh i know i did not day before yesterday i had a lady on the phone and um 

266.59 268.04 B: (( [laughter] )) 

274.39 283.30 A: she used to live in california which is where i live now and we kind of got side tracked so i was just hoping i was going to get called again [laughter] 

283.06 284.97 B: yeah i would worry about that too 

284.97 286.72 A: right [laughter] 

287.06 293.40 A: but uh let's see we've covered children and the workplace and uh 

294.25 307.54 A: do you think there's any inappropriate humour as far as like [noise] to share a joke with your mates or a program like that or do you feel like probably people that are involved you could probably 

307.91 308.77 A: (( um )) 

308.04 320.02 B: i think it like you kind of said before it all depends on the person some might take it i mean you certainly wouldn't joke about you know things with your accent and going to that territory you know 

311.88 312.96 A: right 

316.21 316.99 A: (( [noise] )) 

320.15 330.68 B: comparisons and things that sort i wouldn't think or at least i wouldn't i know everybody's different so how they take things and how personal they get 

328.56 329.55 A: right 

330.89 337.62 A: yeah and i think um too if you don't know someone so well that that wouldn't include your spouse hopefully [laughter] 

336.55 338.21 B: (( [laughter] i hope not )) 

337.71 350.73 A: [laughter] but i think it's also good to stay away from um religious humour um you know any of that kind of offensive uh you know 

345.61 346.29 B: (( oh )) 

350.36 351.30 B: right 

351.07 353.20 A: (( racist or )) 

352.70 353.83 B: oh yeah 

353.37 355.41 A: uh sexist 

355.41 357.55 B: and there's a lot of that stuff out there a 

357.62 358.87 A: right 

357.93 362.95 B: huge portion of it is is racist and has to do with religion and 

363.79 365.59 B: things like that 

365.03 370.45 A: right and i guess if if you know the person well enough and you happen to be of the religion 

370.49 379.04 A: then it might be appropriate to share a joke but that's really where you kind of get into a grey area i would say 

378.79 388.51 B: right and with different uh ethnicities and stuff it always seems that um african american can talk jokes about their same race 

388.62 389.59 A: right 

388.80 395.91 B: of course and with with interest like that and that i think is appropriate but something that they want to do or 

396.01 399.84 B: whoever making fun of themselves or what not 

399.63 405.16 A: that's true [noise] [noise] yeah i know i have watched some comedy programs that uh 

400.46 401.31 B: yeah 

403.18 404.22 B: (( [noise] )) 

405.25 412.53 A: have seemed very border line where you first kind of go oh i can't believe they said that on t._v. 

411.22 413.53 B: yeah yeah 

412.81 419.46 A: [laughter] it's really taking a chance there with uh you know sexist humour racist humour 

419.42 420.49 B: (( yeah )) 

420.78 422.16 B: (( t._v. now )) 

422.11 423.76 A: (( exactly )) 

422.26 424.38 B: i mean tear it apart and 

424.46 425.79 A: right 

425.20 426.48 B: yeah 

426.16 431.59 A: where as like [noise] there's the man show [noise] 

431.70 440.60 A: my daughter's putting in her two cents [laughter] but uh like with the man show they do quite a bit of uh sexist humour 

433.82 435.12 B: [laughter] 

440.51 441.47 B: yeah 

440.66 454.89 A: and uh i think that comes on late enough at night and if you you don't like it just change the channel but uh they're not doing anything against the law and you know i guess freedom of speech and 

447.35 448.48 B: right 

454.48 455.51 B: right 

454.93 459.98 A: uh so if you enjoy it watch it if you don't you know don't watch it 

459.92 464.78 B: i think there's a lot of kids that don't really have good parents who monitor 

464.94 471.80 B: what they have and they have like a t._v. in their room and end up watching stuff like that and not much you can do about it's 

472.00 474.55 B: out there and they're going to watch it but 

474.56 478.72 A: that's true my son's only in third grade and he'll come home talking about 

478.88 483.12 A: that so and so at school was talking about this south park episode 

481.35 482.54 B: right 

483.31 490.99 A: uh and so it's really difficult that even if you're parenting in your own home the way that you believe in 

490.94 499.45 A: they still wind up exposed to children that parents are relaxed about what they watch on t._v. or 

499.28 502.08 B: yeah no matter what you will always be exposed 

502.47 505.70 B: to something in the world you can't keep them in a little bubble 

505.50 508.71 A: unfortunately i know [laughter] 

506.26 507.65 B: (( [laughter] you know )) 

508.75 509.92 B: yeah 

510.87 511.72 B: (( but )) 

513.22 517.42 A: [laughter] trying to think if there's anything that we didn't cover here 

515.35 516.00 B: (( um )) 

517.85 526.74 B: um you can also i guess could say when you're out in public catch a lot of jokes that maybe you're not necessarily talking to someone with but overhear 

527.01 527.99 A: right 

527.26 528.76 B: sometime that can 

528.86 541.09 A: [noise] yeah i think a lot of people don't really monitor themselves very well because they will be like out in a mall or something and speaking loud enough [noise] uh 

540.26 541.45 B: (( [noise] )) 

541.14 545.36 A: saying joke that that could be offensive to someone else 

543.96 548.04 B: right especially around children and stuff like that too and 

548.33 553.85 B: other races and just any kind in general sensitivity to 

554.39 555.79 B: anything really 

555.61 563.50 A: right right i know like they'll be teenagers out some place where i'll have my young son and daughter and uh 

563.61 564.62 A: they'll be 

564.64 575.63 A: joking around and swearing and and they'll do it very very loudly and uh uh on several occasions my husband or i have actually had to approach them and you know 

569.14 570.60 B: mhm 

575.52 581.52 A: remind them that there are young children around and that it's not appropriate for them to be 

581.59 585.91 A: speaking in such a way that these kids are hearing these words 

586.66 588.18 B: right right 

588.95 590.90 B: not everybody really 

591.20 592.63 B: cares too much 

592.91 594.76 B: about things like that 

594.91 599.89 A: right [noise] yeah i think it kind of goes back to that if everybody would just treat them
