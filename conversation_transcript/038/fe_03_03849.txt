28.61 33.18 A: like make themselves feel better about like sarcasm maybe 

32.97 34.39 B: yeah 

33.79 37.12 A: to make themselves feel better about themselves 

38.39 39.34 A: (( um )) 

40.70 42.14 A: i don't know [laughter] 

41.63 43.21 B: [laughter] 

42.92 44.28 A: weird topic 

44.37 50.87 B: yeah it kind of is i guess i don't mind a lot of vulgar 

51.28 62.62 B: humour i mean i can tolerate it to a point but i don't like a lot of vulgarity you know if it's a constant thing you know if they slip in a bad word here and there you know that's not so bad but if it's 

53.96 54.98 A: mhm 

63.02 64.93 B: a constant thing i don't like 

63.07 69.38 A: right well do you ever watch the like standup comedy on h._b._o. at night or anything like that

69.74 71.66 A: they can get pretty vulgar 

71.35 72.88 B: yeah they sure can 

74.50 75.47 A: um 

75.78 78.79 A: [noise] 

77.95 79.32 B: are you computering 

79.41 82.27 B: [laughter] are you computering 

79.97 81.25 A: i'm sorry

85.67 86.74 A: (( um )) 

87.17 92.48 A: playing i just was somebody else i know is calling in and i was telling them the topic [laughter] 

92.72 94.13 B: [laughter] 

94.32 96.22 A: um i guess 

96.25 98.02 A: i guess like 

98.04 102.63 A: when it is appropriate or when it isn't appropriate would just depend on 

102.80 106.89 A: you know who you're the age group you're talking to and 

105.13 105.84 B: (( that's )) 

106.29 107.66 B: true that's true 

107.62 110.65 A: like i guess in the workplace um 

111.00 114.48 A: like real sarcastic humor's probably not appropriate 

114.96 117.56 A: it's just and 

115.23 116.59 B: right 

117.66 119.55 A: stuff like that um 

120.84 122.08 A: i don't know i work 

122.43 124.20 A: from home so 

124.82 127.45 A: i don't really get you know

129.54 130.85 B: [laughter] 

130.31 131.87 A: they're usually pretty clean 

133.61 142.71 B: yeah that's the one thing there you can make a choice there pretty much what you want to look at and what you don't as far as vulgarity and 

139.13 140.81 A: (( yeah right right )) 

143.46 144.96 B: that's one way you do 

145.71 147.17 B: have a choice 

148.67 155.73 A: do you like i mean for you do you prefer like jokes told in person or through email or 

155.95 164.39 B: i don't really have a preference i love my husband when he tells jokes he's very animated [laughter] and he can be pretty vulgar but 

161.45 162.36 A: right 

164.33 165.24 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

165.07 166.82 B: but i can tolerate him 

166.98 168.64 A: (( but you think um )) 

169.34 175.16 A: guys should just tell vulgar jokes to other guys or you think it's ok- okay if girls are around 

174.51 176.63 B: it depends on who the girls are 

176.42 177.94 A: yeah 

178.03 184.61 B: like he wouldn't do it around my family my family wouldn't tolerate something like that and he he wouldn't do that 

184.83 187.86 B: but there's a couple of our neighbors that he would probably 

188.72 190.58 B: wouldn't feel you know 

191.92 194.07 B: bad about saying a bad joke 

194.12 199.50 B: i do draw the line at a lot of the the racial slur ones and that i don't find those very funny 

199.82 204.24 A: right right is it i mean it doesn't seem like people are telling those as much as they used to 

203.99 205.65 B: not really it doesn't 

206.50 207.30 A: (( ah )) 

206.60 207.28 B: (( you )) 

208.38 211.45 A: definitely not on like stand up comedy

216.58 217.89 B: (( what is that )) 

216.82 217.57 A: (( um )) 

218.67 219.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

219.44 220.41 B: oh 

219.81 221.90 A: like jokes about the president 

224.59 230.52 B: i'm sorry my daughter just brought me the innards of a cassette tape [laughter] 

229.89 230.79 A: (( [laughter] um )) 

231.17 233.46 B: have you done these phone calls before 

232.85 234.62 A: i i've done one 

234.17 236.22 B: oh yeah that's all i've done too 

237.06 240.32 B: um in fact it was a they called me earlier 

240.50 241.84 A: oh really 

241.23 246.20 B: and did it that way and then i didn't know if you could do it more than once so i called in this time to 

246.90 249.07 B: to see about doing it 

248.65 250.84 A: so you've already talked about comedy today 

250.45 251.94 B: yeah 

251.34 253.68 A: okay what'd you all talk about in your last one 

253.05 255.17 B: [laughter] pretty much the same thing 

255.04 256.33 A: yeah 

255.71 259.92 B: movies and you know how movies can be very vulgar you know 

260.87 261.83 A: right 

261.42 262.28 B: it's 

262.52 273.83 B: if it's really really bad we'll we will just turn it off and there's different ones that we'll watch i have a sixteen year old there's different ones we'll watch with him and that 

274.34 277.36 B: won't let the three year old watch you know we'll wait till she's in bed 

277.90 280.14 A: okay yeah 

278.90 282.89 B: and i've got i've got a pretty good age gap between the two and 

282.27 285.65 A: right big difference in the comedy i guess 

285.04 286.14 B: yeah 

286.45 291.41 B: the older one i know that when he's away from me he talks like that he won't do it around me but 

291.46 292.45 A: right 

291.65 294.96 B: [laughter] i know when he gets out with his friends and that he will if 

294.92 299.02 A: right what um what do you think about jokes 

299.36 300.38 A: um 

300.87 304.75 A: made toward the government or the president you 

305.10 309.22 A: think those are appropriate or not appropriate or 

308.27 310.84 B: it's the government in general i think 

312.92 320.87 B: are usually appropriate now making them about the president i think that's kind of iffy it just depends on how the joke is made i guess 

317.53 318.51 A: right 

320.58 321.90 A: mhm 

322.48 328.28 B: if it's you know of course you don't want to do a threatening one they'll come and get you [laughter] 

326.79 328.20 A: right right 

328.41 333.38 B: some of them you know can be kind of funny i know there was some funny clinton ones 

333.50 334.92 B: going around but 

334.99 337.35 A: right with the whole monica lewinsky thing 

337.04 343.83 B: yeah and you know and in truth he set himself up for most of that so you can't feel too awful bad about it 

341.36 342.29 A: right 

344.22 345.81 A: right ah 

347.24 350.77 A: yeah th- that's i mean most of the jokes that i see are probably 

351.05 351.94 A: (( um )) 

353.03 357.00 A: that kind of that kind of jokes or vulgar jokes or 

357.05 361.05 A: um sometimes i'll get some stuff about like

363.81 366.56 A: african americans jewish people 

367.05 372.68 A: you know but not as much as i can used to remember when i was younger people kind telling those kind of jokes 

373.87 374.95 B: that's true 

375.50 377.96 A: seems like they're not told as often 

379.73 380.49 A: (( ah )) 

382.21 383.11 A: anyway 

384.22 387.80 A: do you ever go to comedy shows or anything like that

401.85 403.07 B: [laughter] 

403.15 409.67 B: i'd say the vulgarity doesn't bother me that much unless there's you know if there's a lot of sexual 

409.62 410.45 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

410.22 411.16 B: very
