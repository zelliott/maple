21.54 24.89 A: oh good lord i don't know this is my first call did you do this before 

24.31 26.15 B: i did it once yesterday 

25.81 28.29 A: this is just so weird [laughter] 

27.59 32.40 B: i was like wow okay it's good for ho- hope i'll participate in the survey kinda thing and i 

31.36 33.76 A: exactly get a little money for it 

33.07 40.41 B: get a little money for it can't go wrong there [sigh] but i guess you just talk you just talk about what you think eh 

33.98 35.21 A: [laughter] 

35.49 36.25 A: [sigh] 

39.54 43.66 A: um [sigh] let's see comedy good taste and bad taste hm 

44.25 48.40 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] i don't know it i think it's a pretty close line [laughter] 

47.69 50.93 B: i think if it's funny to you then 

50.98 60.62 B: [sigh] could be it really depends on the person really i mean uh [sigh] most comedy it depends on who it's coming from too if you know it's a comedy most stuff is in good taste 

52.81 54.71 A: yeah yeah 

59.79 73.31 A: yeah that's true [sigh] i mean as long as it's not really like offending you know [sigh] like any race of people or any certain type of this or you know what i mean as long as it's not really offending anybody that although some people find that funny [laughter] 

66.83 67.39 B: (( yeah )) 

70.86 80.67 B: well most comedy is yeah well most comedy is o- of- offending i guess [sigh] what really happens is if you're the same race as you're making fun of people usually don't think that's bad taste 

74.80 76.24 A: yeah 

80.09 82.62 A: that's true unless you're like the opposite then 

82.14 88.85 B: then they'll think w- and i don't think there should be a distinction [sigh] but i that's the way people think [cough] ten minutes 

87.41 89.55 A: exactly exactly [sigh] 

89.57 93.78 A: hm let's see good lord ten minutes of talk for comedy [sigh] 

92.97 96.18 B: yeah i don't know i watched the one of the uh chris rock comedies 

95.81 97.10 A: oh you did 

96.47 102.10 B: yeah um on d._v._d. [sigh] and he's pretty offensive you know he's like 

100.66 102.00 A: yeah he is 

102.23 109.38 B: [sigh] w- but [sigh] he's like well you know black people are more racist than white people because they don't like white people and they don't like black people [laughter] 

108.05 112.82 A: [laughter] [sigh] that's true it's okay for them to make all the jokes [laughter] 

111.48 118.20 B: yeah but but it is true because i think especially in that point of view there is um 

118.43 124.98 B: [lipsmack] there is bad people in every race and those bad people just give the majority a bad name that's why 

120.75 121.84 A: that's true 

125.10 127.86 B: [sigh] and that's why there is different stereotypes 

127.49 133.52 A: exactly and i think the hard part for people is just realising that it is just a joke [laughter] yeah 

131.74 135.73 B: it's a joke and and people are individuals [cough] yeah 

134.32 143.50 A: they're not trying you know you watch a movie that maybe you don't think is so funny i don't know think they're trying to get out there and just you know offend people uh [mn] blatantly offend people [sigh] 

142.89 145.89 B: no they're not and people take you out of proportion 

145.70 147.02 A: yeah 

146.36 153.86 B: and i think the whole system kind of advocates that 'cause they get the publicity if it's uh [sigh] 

150.95 152.03 A: (( i agree )) 

154.15 159.28 B: if it's funny then they don't get as much publicity if it's uh controversial 

158.63 164.64 A: that's true that's true [laughter] they're definitely going to get a lot people wanting to see it if it is controversial 

160.65 161.58 B: if they 

163.40 166.73 B: like yeah you know who what's what's going on with the 

166.02 169.83 A: yeah what part of texas i'm like off the subject what part of texas do you live in 

169.42 171.79 B: oh i live in uh eastern near houston 

171.40 173.83 A: i used to live there when i was like in fourth grade 

173.42 174.94 B: wow i 

174.00 176.95 A: yeah i lived in san antonio and then killeen 

176.76 177.87 B: uh oh okay 

177.45 182.18 A: but that was like a long time ago [laughter] [sigh] but it was pretty cool that's cool [lipsmack] 

178.91 179.64 B: [laughter] 

181.18 184.13 B: (( it's pretty good it's kinda hot [cough] tough )) 

182.81 184.99 A: yeah [laughter] definitely 

184.50 188.53 B: [noise] l._a. is nice i lived in northern california silicon valley and [sigh] 

187.91 188.86 A: yeah 

188.66 190.00 B: that's [sigh] 

190.36 192.63 B: (( i don't know it seems expensive )) 

192.04 193.68 A: yeah [laughter] 

192.80 197.45 B: not as much to do as in l._a. southern california i think is much is probably nicer 

195.57 196.79 A: definitely 

197.41 209.76 A: [sigh] southern california there's just there's just a lot more to do and you're to the b- you know beaches and stuff like that [sigh] but um northern california has a lot more uh greenery [sigh] trees [sigh] all that nice stuff you know so [lipsmack] 

201.68 203.19 B: yeah 

209.16 210.71 B: (( oh mhm greenery's nice )) 

209.66 217.10 A: and i guess different parts of the country speaking of probably would uh make people feel different about maybe comedy and things like that too 

217.23 218.18 B: oh yes 

217.52 220.21 A: you know how they grew up with certain things [sigh] 

219.81 223.40 B: yeah and i th- it's i think um in the 

220.64 221.48 A: so 

223.66 234.94 B: in the pursuit of trying to make everyone happy [sigh] you kinda you you just comedy kinda gets thrown by the wayside because [sigh] certain things aren't offensive but the way we're 

235.05 246.08 B: [sigh] raised i- in a lot of places like oh you should accept everyone but there is a difference between what people really think [sigh] and and what may or may not be true and what's funny 

242.39 243.45 A: mhm 

246.00 250.25 A: yeah i agree i agree and most movies nowadays anyway [sigh] i 

250.37 256.10 A: i like the fact that you know we have this whole new rating system you know whatever that we've been doing the last couple of years or whatever 

255.83 257.08 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

256.44 266.18 A: [sigh] the way that we uh rate movies because i have a child [sigh] she's four [sigh] you know and it's it's some comedy it's okay for adults and some comedy it's not okay for kids you know 

265.68 276.80 B: yeah they don't understand it's a comedy a- a- and they'll take it seriously and um [sigh] i think it's the ratings are good for parents to know what they should have their children see or not [sigh] 

267.55 268.93 A: exactly 

270.25 271.09 A: and 

276.17 277.55 A: exactly 

277.03 287.66 B: but i think i m- it should be up to the parents i know parents you guys you can't watch every movie and say okay this is okay to watch because i've seen it [sigh] so it it helps out 

283.17 284.53 A: [laughter] yeah 

287.06 298.04 A: yeah i can imagine that the older she gets how it's going to be a lot harder [sigh] to try and figure out what's okay for her to watch and what's not like you said it's like i can watch every single movie [laughter] before she does [laughter] 

290.34 291.54 B: yeah 

295.29 296.66 B: (( [laughter] )) 

296.85 302.91 B: yeah well i think maybe yeah if you teach your daughter right then i don't think there'll be any problems she'll understand 

302.33 303.26 A: mhm 

303.22 305.79 B: what's right and what's wrong and it's just a movie 

303.27 303.97 A: the 

305.41 307.43 A: exactly what the difference is 

306.71 316.37 B: yeah what the different i think [mn] by a certain age [sigh] most children have like their views of the world are ready and [sigh] they have their morals set 

313.55 314.58 A: mhm 

316.49 317.91 A: (( mhm [sigh] )) 

317.28 322.65 B: so a bad movie is not going say oh i'm going to do all these bad things for younger children definitely 

320.73 321.83 A: that's true 

322.03 324.30 A: yeah [laughter] younger definitely 

323.63 335.23 B: [lipsmack] younger definitely or too young they won't even understand but [mn] they're just a certain age maybe [sigh] you know teens early teens or something like that where [sigh] they're just starting to understand 

326.19 327.14 A: yeah 

334.08 335.95 A: they're still impressionable [sigh] 

335.33 346.90 B: yeah w- what's going on they're trying to make their own decisions on what they want to be like and are developing their own personalities and this [sigh] and that's when they're pretty uh impressionable and vulnerable to these things 

342.17 343.32 A: mhm 

347.03 355.23 B: they see [sigh] something over and over again it's like okay must be true i'm going to base my life off of this movie [laughter] 

348.04 349.04 A: yeah 

350.83 352.10 A: mhm 

354.88 361.62 A: [sigh] i'm trying to remember what the last [cough] comedy i saw was i think i've been pretty much watching a lot of dramas instead of comedies lately 

361.08 365.32 B: i haven't watched [sigh] that many movies lately uh oh i watched x. men 

363.66 364.63 A: really 

365.53 366.48 A: the new one 

366.58 368.65 B: yeah the new one that was pretty good 

367.98 375.28 A: hah i just had ice cream the other day that was [laughter] from baskin-robbins it was x. ice cream [sigh] how funny [laughter] 

372.81 374.20 B: (( x. ice cream wow )) 

374.42 376.74 B: but that was that was uh that was pretty good 

376.15 379.13 A: was it really [mn] did they have any comedy in that one 

376.98 378.04 B: yeah 

378.85 382.26 B: [sigh] um there are just tiny tongue in cheek kind of comedy 

381.70 385.88 A: yeah little things here and there it's mostly an action flick anyway [sigh] 

383.05 385.74 B: little things here and there yeah 

385.82 395.03 B: 'cause like it yeah it j- people who know have seen the other one [sigh] all say oh this is kind of funny because i've seen the next one yeah 

391.00 394.02 A: yeah yeah yeah they can compare the two 

394.15 401.77 A: [sigh] yeah i usually rent movies but i don't i can't remember the last time i saw something that was funny [sigh] have you ever heard of the movie um vulgar the clown 

401.88 403.56 B: (( no i haven't )) 

402.98 405.63 A: okay um have you ever seen um 

405.73 408.48 A: [sigh] clerks and chasing amy and all that 

407.72 410.83 B: yeah the uh kevin smith movies uh-huh 

409.29 412.45 A: yeah yeah same same guy made vulgar the clown 

412.01 413.10 B: oh okay 

412.67 420.78 A: but uh i guess i haven't seen it yet and you can obviously kind of get from the get from the title that it is a little vulgar [laughter] [sigh] yeah i guess it's about this 

418.02 420.00 B: (( vulgar yeah [laughter] mhm mm )) 

421.02 427.15 A: clown that i don't know he's just so rude and so this and this and that and just like you know the things that he goes through in life and whatever and 

426.38 428.25 B: mhm 

427.59 433.11 A: [sigh] that i don't know like that's something that's probably going to be very very funny [laughter] some parts of it 

433.26 438.14 A: [lipsmack] and i can't wait to rent it although i haven't actually done it yet [sigh] but uh you know 

437.75 439.33 B: probably offensive like 

438.74 441.62 A: yeah there's probably a lot of it that crosses the line 

441.14 444.43 B: like uh did you see dogma by uh kevin smith 

443.80 445.60 A: yeah i saw that 

444.97 447.53 B: i mean that can be offensive but it's funny 

446.97 454.11 A: mhm my my parents my parents would not like that at all [sigh] you know being that my parents are more religious than i am at you know [sigh] they'd they wouldn't 

449.71 450.57 B: yeah 

452.63 461.88 B: well i'm religious but i don't think it really it's it's a comedy don't take it [sigh] you take it seriously in a sense that yes it does happen that's why it's funny 

457.28 458.26 A: yeah 

461.28 462.61 A: yeah 

462.02 469.75 B: and if you can't look at yourself and find out the things you do and w- what you actually look like from someone outside 

469.18 470.48 A: exactly 

470.05 473.35 B: you can't really [sigh] like they um 

473.71 477.68 B: [mn] well like the iraqi information minister did you hear anything 

477.10 478.01 A: no 

477.89 482.63 B: he he's the guy who goes up there and says well everything's fine we're killing all the americans 

482.06 482.98 A: (( mm )) 

482.81 491.80 B: they're not even here and there are like people in the back- like tanks in the background and he's just saying that all propaganda [laughter] but that to us that's a comedy 

486.27 487.20 A: yeah 

487.49 489.25 A: all propaganda [laughter] 

489.31 490.48 A: (( [laughter] exactly )) 

491.56 496.19 A: yeah [laughter] yeah sure you're winning sure [laughter] [laughter] 

494.35 505.22 B: yeah it's very y- we know what's going on but [sigh] i think to the people there if we if maybe [sigh] to certain people there and we were laughing at that they would find it offensive 

496.50 497.42 A: yeah 

504.63 506.81 A: (( yeah that's true that's true )) 

506.93 510.69 A: [sigh] so i guess you know like most things it's an individual thing person to person 

509.84 511.75 B: yeah person to person 

511.12 518.74 A: yeah you can [mn] do things like make guidelines like our rating system and whatever but [lipsmack] it really is just person to person 

516.23 530.11 B: yeah it is for you yeah just it gives you a little b- the base level of [sigh] of competency i think i think yesterday's topic was minimum wage mhm [laughter] and pretty much that's what we discussed is minimum wage 

522.34 523.28 A: yeah 

524.54 525.63 A: oh really 

530.32 538.71 B: is so people don't get totally screwed out of getting paid [sigh] but it's still not enough to really live off of 

533.81 534.80 A: uh-huh 

537.81 540.10 A: exactly [laughter] [sigh] not nearly enough 

539.51 543.85 B: not near- but [sigh] it's like well if everyone j- if you have a hundred people out of a job 

543.91 546.37 B: [lipsmack] and you have a company that says 

546.60 550.55 B: [sigh] okay we have fifty positions who wants a job [sigh] 

550.57 553.42 B: they can give it to the lowest bidder they'll pay people 

553.67 566.61 B: like fifty cents an hour is better than nothing for these people and half the people will take it and the people who want minimum wage won't get it because [laughter] the other people are under are willing to take lower [sigh] so minimum wage helps in that sense 

556.52 557.97 A: yeah yeah 

562.16 563.98 A: are willing to take the lower 

566.93 568.65 A: yeah i guess 

567.58 570.11 B: but it yeah 

569.58 572.74 A: (( you have to be able to set some type some type of guideline )) 

572.63 573.97 B: yeah but 

573.28 576.02 A: so not everybody gets jerked around [laughter] 

575.24 577.10 B: yeah not everyone but y- y- 

577.32 582.45 B: y- [mn] living in l._a. near l._a. minimum wage is not going to buy you 

582.99 588.41 A: i know it doesn't get you anything you you're not even going to be able to live on your own with minimum wage there's no way [sigh] 

583.39 584.87 B: anything 

586.75 588.90 B: yeah no no way 

588.60 592.79 A: it's is it cheaper in texas because i remember a long time ago we were going to buy a house there 

592.82 596.88 A: [sigh] [cough] and it was just so much cheaper than here and the house was bigger and everything 

596.30 599.95 B: yeah it's cheaper much cheaper [mn] huh m- 

597.93 599.09 A: yeah
