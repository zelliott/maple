82.78 84.33 B: yeah i agree with you 

83.38 90.14 A: but like you know like your own family there's a certain humor that you can use unless you know they're a more open family 

91.71 97.34 B: yeah yeah uh i mean there's inappropriate humor too yeah 

96.83 98.02 A: oh yeah

120.39 123.05 A: make mistakes like falling and everything [laughter] 

123.75 126.12 B: yeah well

140.92 142.12 A: right 

146.33 147.34 A: uh-huh 

147.58 153.00 B: because uh our department's going union and there's a lot of stress between management

182.36 190.46 A: most any time you know except for when you get you know not every client is gonna enjoy humor that goes on throughout the salon but 

190.53 197.11 A: most of the time you know it's in much more laid back atmosphere so you're you're able to joke around a little more 

197.94 200.42 B: right yeah that's

380.12 382.14 B: oh steve martin maybe 

381.50 382.74 A: (( no it )) 

383.49 385.07 B: uh 

384.30 388.52 A: starts with a i think it starts with a c. either his first or last name 

388.35 390.06 B: oh um 

390.28 392.13 B: well that's not 

391.60 392.74 A: right 

392.32 393.33 B: i mean 

393.39 404.53 B: but i tell you one guy who a lot of younger people thinks funny including my daughter but i can't watch him because he he grosses me out do do you know who i'm talking about 

401.52 402.56 A: yeah 

404.16 406.40 A: uh let me guess tom green 

406.05 407.72 B: yeah 

406.75 408.20 A: [laughter] 

408.48 417.74 A: yeah i don't think he's funny he's more see he does things like they do on jackass where you know where some of it's just so stupid but 

408.92 410.11 B: (( yeah )) 

417.96 421.44 A: you know i mean i don't enjoy the sh the show itself but 

421.19 422.35 B: right 

421.77 425.32 A: like i said that's you know probably my favorite humor is when people 

425.95 429.40 A: you know do something physically funny [laughter] but um 

428.43 430.26 B: yeah 

429.97 430.99 A: (( there's )) 

431.22 436.22 A: i you know i'd have to say probably type of seinfeld and like friends that's 

436.25 438.83 A: that's the best humor out of it all 

437.89 440.37 B: yeah yeah i like i like 

440.56 441.96 B: that kind too 

441.42 444.96 A: right because no matter what kind of mood you're in it's 

444.58 446.65 B: (( yeah )) 

446.89 457.53 B: yeah it's funny how you know people take humor differently because some things that me and you would think are funny other people wouldn't laugh and 

453.90 455.06 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

457.11 458.24 A: mhm 

457.64 461.37 B: it's interesting what people think are funny you know i 

460.30 461.13 A: i 

461.54 469.00 B: have to i have to admit i did did watch a tom green show and glanced over the movie he was in 

461.65 462.58 A: go ahead 

466.44 467.77 A: [laughter] 

468.80 469.80 A: yeah 

469.21 476.49 B: i guess it was the only thing on and my daughter was watching it um i've forgotten what the hell it was called um 

477.83 487.92 B: oh well it's not important i just think he he he pushes the uh boundary when when he starts kissing his mum and stuff and the other stuff that's that's not that's bad taste 

481.38 482.46 A: yeah 

484.42 485.65 A: yeah 

487.84 491.10 A: i think also jim carrey pushes the limit 

488.10 488.85 B: (( i mean )) 

491.15 492.37 B: (( you think so )) 

491.39 492.09 A: i 

492.17 495.62 A: oh yeah i think that he's just too much 

495.96 501.15 B: and okay so give me an example of uh where where he pushes the line i'm curious 

500.76 501.97 A: he uses 

502.05 506.54 A: i think like you know there's a someone that you think is just naturally funny 

506.72 520.59 A: you know there's a lot of people that aren't even known as comedians that i think are just their personalities are funny and i think once you push the limit is when you change your person you know like he's not like that all the time 

513.30 514.30 B: yeah 

520.39 521.91 B: right 

521.31 527.60 A: and i think that's when it pushes the limit when he puts on a show just to be you know that's how he was made to be 

527.83 528.85 B: yeah 

528.20 531.08 A: he's he's too much i think he's just too 

531.10 535.06 A: you know like no one could possibly act like that in real life 

534.69 538.38 B: yeah i i know i i can understand that point of view 

536.99 538.63 A: and so is tom green 

538.75 541.62 B: yeah but i mean have you ever seen um 

541.99 545.58 B: did you ever see jim carrey when he was on living color 

545.68 547.52 A: no i never saw him on that 

547.14 551.17 B: see you gotta now you gotta see that's when he first started out 

550.60 551.61 A: right 

551.42 555.40 B: and uh he played this guy this character named fire marshall bill 

555.18 557.49 A: that's probably when he was more normal 

557.59 563.05 A: and then you know he reached his la- his label being funny and then took it beyond that 

557.76 558.69 B: yeah 

563.25 568.06 B: yeah i mean i i still think he's funny but um 

567.89 574.61 A: yeah i mean i don't mind watching him but he he's not like my favorite i think he just kind of pushes it 

570.29 571.24 B: yeah 

573.99 575.48 B: yeah no i 

575.56 578.12 B: you yeah i mean i can see it 

578.21 581.24 B: i like robin williams he's funny 

580.65 584.91 A: yeah he's he's great he was funny back in the days too 

584.76 585.75 B: yeah 

585.04 589.14 A: i i like watching a lot of his older stuff i think that's the funniest 

589.30 592.44 B: yeah that's true 

592.20 594.60 A: oh george carlin that's who it was 

593.96 596.06 B: (( okay )) 

595.35 599.16 A: i think he is the funniest comedian out there 

598.77 599.89 B: that's neat
