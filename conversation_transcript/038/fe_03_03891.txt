0.87 2.09 A: hello 

1.92 2.83 B: hi 

2.33 4.74 A: hi my n- i'm jessica 

4.15 5.33 B: i'm karen 

5.05 9.42 A: hi i didn't quite i didn't hear the beginning what is the topic 

9.11 14.51 B: um how you draw the line between like what's good humor and what's 

14.53 21.05 B: um not acceptable humor [laughter] i was trying to figure out what they mean by that i go to comedy clubs all the time 

15.30 16.58 A: (( like inappropriate )) 

16.65 17.73 A: (( ah )) 

20.63 22.99 A: oh well good [laughter] yeah 

22.02 23.22 B: are you twenty one 

23.66 32.23 A: well yeah i'm twenty eight so um yeah i have a couple of friends actually who did some standup comedy and 

25.40 26.51 B: (( oh [mn] )) 

33.24 35.12 A: i guess i'm pretty [mn] 

35.42 36.58 A: um 

37.53 40.75 A: it's pretty hard to offend me i don't know if i 

40.26 43.21 B: yeah i know i don't take offence very easily either 

42.13 44.44 A: [mn] right i'm trying to think 

44.75 52.42 A: if there's a specific example maybe of something 'cause i certainly i don't feel as though i have like a hard and fast line of 

52.55 53.52 B: i mean 

53.57 54.44 B: my f- 

54.80 66.39 B: i i don't take offence at anything i can i can dig the racial ones or the ethnics because i know it's just a joke and it certainly doesn't pinpoint it to any one person 

66.14 67.21 A: right 

66.58 79.72 B: i know i've been to comedy clubs [mn] with other couples and i kind of look at them and [mn] sometimes they don't like some of the ones on um handicaps or things like that i know i have a girlfriend who takes those pretty personal 

79.45 83.10 A: yeah actually you know what that's an interesting point 'cause i 

80.07 81.02 B: i don't 

83.72 85.39 A: i guess it [sigh] 

86.10 98.53 A: um well i i guess i'm thinking two things at the at the same time the first thing i was thinking is that most of the humor that i choose to expose myself to whether it's a movie that i rent or you know a show 

98.50 101.26 A: that i go to i guess i guess i've already selected 

101.73 106.05 A: a person or a theme that i'm going to like so there aren't many times when i'm 

106.14 110.49 A: in a situation where i'm really caught off guard with the kind of humor 

108.55 110.07 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

110.55 114.88 A: but in terms of ah what you were just mentioning the example of your friend 

115.04 116.10 A: i 

116.26 119.40 A: um a really good friend of mine her son 

119.44 133.89 A: um has autism and he's really involved in the special olympics and it's just he's such a great kid and it's been a really great experience for him and she was saying the other day she had the radio on some just a regular you know top forty station 

133.92 136.68 A: and the d._j. in the morning was just kind of 

137.23 141.97 A: like making fun of th- of the special olympics in particular and 

142.58 147.83 A: and i didn't hear it but it that you know what it did bother me i was kind of surprised um 

146.99 151.55 B: ah and she takes she takes offence to those things very quickly 

150.64 154.25 A: no no she doesn't actually um 

154.43 162.43 B: see especially like if it's just radio talk show that- that's where a lot of the comedy is too i get that off actually morning drives 

162.15 163.18 A: right 

162.36 172.02 B: and things like that but you got to realise they're just doing that for their job i don't take offence to much very i just don't let a whole lot in this world bother me life's too short [laughter] 

168.54 169.56 A: yeah 

171.34 175.30 A: [laughter] yeah actually you know what i guess maybe that is partly what [mn] 

176.39 182.28 B: and those talk shows are just they live and pray for the fact that callers will be pissed off and call in 

181.97 186.38 A: yeah that's true i guess that's kind of what it is you see i don't find them 

186.87 188.48 A: i don't usually 

189.12 196.02 A: [mn] i don't take offence but i don't find them funny you know what i'm saying i find it more annoying like if i'm going to 

192.04 193.11 B: yeah 

196.45 208.93 B: i'll be flipping through t._v. channels there's one of those comedy central and depending on what they're talking about i'll just like keep flipping i mean or the same thing with the radio station if if it's a topic and they birch me i just 

200.42 201.21 A: uh-huh 

206.15 207.04 A: right 

209.42 212.92 B: keep flipping go on to the next you know better station 

212.56 213.62 A: (( right )) 

213.39 218.54 B: but there's some people that take it to an extreme although 

217.39 219.84 A: right right i know 

218.99 220.61 B: yeah [sigh] 

220.28 224.44 A: tha- that's another thing i hadn't thought of i guess there's the question 

224.67 227.54 A: of um what's offensive but also 

228.02 232.05 A: just in general what you find funny 'cause like when i was thinking about th- 

232.43 235.77 A: this comment on the radio see i never would have considered that 

235.99 237.17 A: humor 

237.29 244.52 A: i guess [mn] not like i wouldn't have been all upset and taken aback by it though and just thinking about comedy 

242.09 243.27 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

244.58 253.96 A: that's you know i think of like jerry seinfeld or you know i don't i wouldn't think of some schmuck on [laughter] the morning show that's not what jumps to mind like 

247.29 248.38 B: [laughter] 

251.17 251.90 B: right 

254.16 258.46 A: um do y- are there certain kinds of comedy that you really like 

258.92 266.20 B: i'm trying to think shows and things not really lately and i'm married me and my husband are into the all the reality shows 

265.58 267.36 A: okay i was going to say 

266.21 268.56 B: i don't know how humorous those are 

267.90 270.80 A: (( [laughter] well they can be pretty funny )) 

270.46 275.67 B: i don't take offence to much like what they're doing on the survivor shows and 

275.15 276.52 A: you know what i just 

276.01 277.64 B: big brother all those 

277.04 286.71 A: i just watched i have never watched survivor before and i have a friend who is really into it so i just watched it for the first time yesterday [laughter] 

280.37 281.30 B: mhm 

285.87 292.02 B: and joe millionaire and bachelor hey i mean i think if those aren't comedies i don't know what is 

291.21 293.97 A: [laughter] true 

292.13 295.05 B: it's comedy and reality all at once 

294.43 295.69 A: i know 

295.98 300.88 A: it's really it is really funny are you watching survivor this season 

300.14 305.52 B: oh yeah we don't miss a single sh- well any of those reality shows we just love 'em 

305.13 311.29 A: well speaking of humor then the moment did you see yesterday where heidi got voted off 

310.71 312.06 B: yeah 

311.30 321.98 A: and right before [laughter] when she she was saying how she was the mastermind behind everyth- and the the looks that people were giving each other at that now i thought that was very funny 

316.19 317.72 B: mhm 

321.52 329.88 B: i thought it was great that rob told her that he was going to have to vote one of the girls off that he was trying to be somewhat honest towards the end but 

325.90 326.93 A: right 

328.48 329.69 A: right 

329.95 332.24 B: you watch these ah the bachelor 

332.27 334.33 A: i must say i haven't seen that one 

332.32 333.27 B: guy 

334.57 341.62 B: here talking about humor i don't find that to be very funny i take offence at that the guy like made it with three different girls 

341.64 344.12 B: and then has to like let one go 

344.19 348.68 B: i mean that's not a fun that's just not fun to be in that girl's situation 

347.93 356.39 A: no do they now is that something i mean do people like i said 'cause i haven't seen it so do most people think of that as something that's funny 

356.53 359.63 A: (( like th- i don't know the your friends or coworkers )) 

357.89 365.69 B: mine oh my my friends i know in my social circle i'm like in a lot of different mom clubs and things like that and and they're like um 

363.87 364.80 A: right 

365.84 380.64 B: they're just thinking that is hilarious that is all we talk about when we call each other and meet up for different play groups with our kids we talk about did you see that the one girl was a very nice girl and she didn't want to sleep with the guy and she finally like gave him her heart and all that 

380.66 390.97 B: does th- does the deed and of course he's like sleeping around with all these different women and then he has to keep letting one go every night until it gets to his final pick 

390.61 391.73 A: okay 

391.04 402.59 B: [mn] so but i don't know why i'm calling that a comedy show but it is i guess that's why we're watching it because we think it's so far off that you can meet a person that way that it actually becomes humorous 

402.04 403.22 A: right 

402.60 405.55 B: then to talk about it the next day to all your friends 

404.92 412.74 A: yeah that's that's true that's the funny part is whenever i watch these shows it's like immediately i want to talk to my friends who are watching it too 

407.97 408.72 B: oh 

409.55 411.11 B: you're not missing much 

412.71 413.84 B: oh yeah 

413.07 415.07 A: that's half the fun [laughter] 

414.19 424.12 B: it is half the fun to have people to share in the conversation and watch it with you or talk about it the next day and it's always on our radio stations um the next morning 

418.45 419.75 A: i know isn't 

423.90 429.33 A: that funny how wh- what is it that makes it so in troubles you discuss 

424.85 425.81 B: yep 

427.39 431.21 B: by the way are you in are you in the university of pennsylvania 

430.90 435.57 A: no i'm not i have a friend who's actually working on this project and 

434.94 437.02 B: oh that's how you got in it okay 

435.99 439.45 A: yes he's been desperately looking for people to sign up 

439.04 444.85 B: i had a friend refer me and i actually you're going to get a kick out of this i'm in indiana i'm not 

444.39 445.20 A: (( ah )) 

445.03 454.20 B: i'm not in college any more i am thirty three i've got two kids so yeah this is i think maybe she got it out on the internet or what what they don't care 

452.43 465.00 A: yeah well there's there's been a lot of [mn] i spoke the other night with some woman who was in alabama so i i don't know how the people find out about it but it seems to be all over the u._s. 

459.54 460.40 B: yeah 

464.81 469.59 B: yeah i did learn y-you don't hang up you got to let the system do that for you 

468.73 471.24 A: exactly [laughter] 

469.84 472.31 B: (( but back to comedy )) 

471.81 477.11 A: you're right [laughter] well i was just thinking of something when you were talking about the reality shows and 

477.02 487.83 A: um you know er especially the bachelor 'cause i found i think maybe part of what makes it funny is how you feel about the person because when i was watching joe millionaire 

485.11 485.96 B: (( yep )) 

488.06 493.32 A: like the girls that i didn't like when things would happen to them i would find it funny 

493.11 494.28 B: (( [laughter] )) 

493.48 497.31 A: but when it if it was someone that i identified with 

497.42 505.48 A: and they were ridiculing her then it would upset me yeah so like it's really subjective and 

498.11 499.03 B: yeah 

500.27 501.87 B: then you take it personal 

504.78 516.49 B: yeah ah joe millionaire you said you watched that one that sarah the one that went with him into the forest to do all kinds of things she was on ah just 'cause my husband gets playboy i have to tell you 

511.03 512.07 A: yeah 

516.09 517.34 A: oh no 

516.51 519.46 B: she was i don't care that's that's just a maga- 

518.06 520.72 A: [laughter] is that funny [laughter] 

520.41 522.92 B: no that's fine that's ah 

522.11 523.18 A: (( i'm just kidding )) 

522.94 534.70 B: ninety percent of the population of men probably but uh i don't let that bother me but it said on there what joe was missing it had a picture of sarah she was the centerfold that month she got like a half a million to do that spread 

524.40 525.78 A: exactly 

534.25 535.59 A: really 

535.03 537.19 B: yeah but um 

536.08 536.98 A: (( wow )) 

537.23 548.40 B: now see i find that to be funny i'm like great is this a catch to a guy anyway who would want this girl that's going to go and do something like this but in return i let my husband read it so [laughter] i wonder if 

544.59 545.97 A: right 

546.91 555.19 A: [laughter] that's true i think it's i've i've if that's what we find offensive i don't i don't find that such a big 

550.73 552.15 B: we've answered this 

555.28 557.41 A: a big issue at all you know 

556.70 562.65 B: is this answered yes i suppose we've answered it to draw the line good and bad [laughter] comedy who knows 

562.14 563.31 A: yeah [laughter] 

563.26 571.02 B: i don't even know really what they're looking for maybe the way we are able to start a conversation with one another did your friend tell you anything or 

569.45 570.34 A: i think 

570.73 572.96 A: i think it has to do 

573.08 577.45 A: well they have to go through an interview they transcribe our entire conversation 

577.24 579.12 B: oh my that's a lot of work 

577.75 580.18 A: word for word [laughter] 

579.47 581.86 B: (( i hope they have a lot of people helping them )) 

581.79 583.02 A: ah well they 

583.18 585.66 A: (( you know what that's an interesting question i don't know )) 

585.86 589.58 A: i don't know how many people are working on it but i don't think 

589.63 594.91 A: it's not really important that we stick to the specific topic that's 

593.39 596.63 B: it's awfully hard for ten minutes we've done 

595.86 597.19 A: i know 

597.09 598.53 B: (( pretty well )) 

597.79 599.89 A: (( yeah [laughter] it is and so well so ))
