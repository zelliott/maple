131.73 143.25 A: now see i do like him he's hilarious 'cause you know everybody loves bill cosby i've watched bill cosby do stand ups since you know in the seventies i mean i'm only thirty but still 

143.36 152.25 A: you know um but this guy did his own version of red neck jokes and [noise] just rally clean humor and you know and then i've also 

152.07 160.77 A: been to before i started getting back into church i've been to some stand up clubs where alls they did was just say nothing but sex jokes and you're like 

160.65 167.19 A: even even when you're at a club like that you're like well come on let's get on with something else rather than just talking about sex 

167.22 176.57 B: well um i go to comedy clubs a lot but then again when you live in new york you enjoy new york life which includes comedy 

175.08 176.41 A: oh yeah 

177.02 191.04 B: and i once saw drew carey in person and i found him quite boring even though even though he was clean and it it was before he became big and i'm here i'm sitting in the front row 

179.83 180.86 A: oh 

182.77 184.14 A: really 

190.68 191.72 A: uh-huh 

191.41 194.20 B: and nothing that he's doing is funny 

193.87 195.05 A: oh wow 

194.41 201.07 B: and he looks at me and says don't you ever laugh and i said yes when it's funny i laugh 

200.45 202.48 A: [laughter] 

201.92 205.07 B: i don't think he appreciated me but uh 

205.18 207.85 B: my brother grew up with richard lewis 

207.80 209.03 A: oh wow 

208.65 210.01 B: yeah 

210.09 214.67 A: yeah see i'm i'm from idaho so most of the people here 

215.56 226.80 A: i don't know i guess we're just i'd guess you'd call us a wannabe town or something because a lot of the people here instead of and another thing i like about comedy is when you incorporate your own style 

226.82 236.46 A: when you don't try to copy everybody else out and i've seen people in clubs that try to copy the style of you know robin williams 

236.50 241.86 A: um [noise] you know jerry seinfeld that sort of thing incorporate your own 

238.03 239.11 B: mhm 

241.56 245.69 B: uh i hate to say it it's gonna be kinda hard to get someone in 

245.89 248.34 B: idaho doing seinfeld 

248.60 251.51 B: that's who he his is a new york humor 

251.01 261.49 A: oh yes yes but what i mean is you know making fun of you know i mean sure make fun of friends and family but not to the extent of where you're trying to copy seinfeld 

261.42 270.13 B: well seinfeld doesn't always do friends and family quite often i never watched his show that much but i think that 

261.61 262.60 A: you know 

270.04 277.38 B: even regular comedy and sitcoms have become far more sophisticated i mean if you think of these sitcoms 

274.93 275.88 A: yeah 

277.27 285.05 B: you know like lucy and all of those they're they're not nearly as sophisticated as the ones of today 

284.09 290.95 A: oh no no i mean it seems like it's gone from slapstick comedy like you know the three stooges 

290.99 295.09 A: lucille the lucille ball show and stuff like that to 

295.61 298.77 A: [noise] i don't know it's evolved to a different kind of humor 

298.77 302.06 B: well i guess it's a reflection on the society i mean 

301.53 302.91 A: oh yeah 

302.38 308.53 B: you know life in the fifties was kind of very you know straightforward 

307.96 309.73 A: yeah yeah 

311.36 312.78 B: but um 

313.14 314.07 B: so you 

314.35 318.77 B: you you have comedy standup clubs up out there 

318.44 326.37 A: well the closest one to us is in boise idaho which is about well about an hour and a half drive but some of the clubs around here 

326.31 336.71 A: will sometimes try to get now there's there was one night they had two guys that's been on evening at the improv and i wanted to go to that because i like watching evening at the improv 

337.56 346.61 A: but i wasn't able to go but usually they get and the sad thing is they don't do it constantly they just do in during the summer time on a thursday night 

345.94 346.66 B: (( oh )) 

347.35 355.62 A: and i would like it to be more often because i love comedy i've thought i've actually thought about getting involved in stand up myself 

350.40 351.00 B: (( oh )) 

356.04 359.83 B: that's it's it's very difficult to break in um 

358.91 360.52 A: [noise] oh yes 

360.30 360.96 B: (( oh )) 

361.44 370.75 B: i'm in new york so we can go to comedy clubs any all the time i mean many years ago i went to dangerfields i don't know if he still owns it 

370.04 372.22 A: (( yeah oh )) 

371.05 373.97 B: but i've been to all of them in the city 

375.76 377.92 B: uh but i find 

378.06 384.95 B: that you're right in that when they deal with reality they tend to be funnier they 

383.89 384.82 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

385.83 389.46 B: and when they deal with their family in a positive way 

389.17 392.67 A: yeah yeah 

392.95 407.44 A: um like well just like for example you know like like you said seinfeld i'm i've never my brother has watched when he's done some specials on t._v. of stand up i've mainly watched his shows 

407.32 416.79 B: i never really watched his shows when it was on i watched a few i didn't find that that funny richard lewis did a sitcom with 

416.78 422.99 B: jamie lee curtis that was excellent lewis i think is far funnier 

418.73 419.70 A: uh-huh 

422.91 428.61 A: oh i bet i mean i haven't seen any i don't think i don't know if i've seen any of his um 

429.74 435.84 A: any of his stuff or but one night you know me and my fiancee we were watching 

436.32 437.63 A: star search 

437.46 438.44 B: yes 

438.21 451.04 A: and they had this young guy on there probably twenty five years old and oh for just being somebody who's an amateur i've never laughed so hard at an amateur comedy act i mean 

450.70 456.03 B: well if you're gonna make it to star search then you've gotta be good to get that far 

455.45 461.68 A: oh yeah well well this guy i mean he blew the other two people that he was going against out of the water and it was 

461.90 463.69 A: you know he 

463.73 465.56 A: 'cause a lot of the times 

465.78 470.12 A: 'cause comedians some of them tell racial jokes against their own race 

470.20 476.90 A: this guy he was telling jokes that were clean racial jokes against everybody even himself 

477.13 479.30 A: and most of the time you know 

479.56 487.91 A: you see comedians stand up there and they tell racial jokes but not so much about themselves it's more of 

487.21 494.25 B: uh no they will they will th- th- they will do it because well let's put it this way 

488.19 489.57 A: some of them are 

494.67 497.99 B: richard lewis seinfeld all of them 

495.74 496.72 A: uh-huh 

498.05 508.00 B: their humor is jewish humor it's just become more popular like i can say it because i'm i'm jewish but it's it's become 

499.80 500.67 A: yeah 

508.07 509.09 B: you know 

509.43 515.83 B: very american and we we you know there's a whole group of them woody allen 

510.22 511.17 A: yeah 

512.06 512.85 A: well 

515.91 516.74 B: uh 

516.92 518.45 B: mel brooks 

518.15 523.64 A: uh-huh yeah and mel brooks is one another one of my favorites i love his stuff 

523.66 532.15 A: and it what i mean is like i mean if you see a black comedian get up yes he'll be racial towards white but he's also racial towards blacks 

532.03 542.00 B: they'll no they'll go more towards their own people it's become uh it's fair more acceptable to knock your own group 

532.40 533.43 A: but when you 

535.29 537.27 A: yeah when you well 

541.87 549.99 A: yeah but i very often i mean unless you count the guy who tells redneck jokes very often do you see a white guy 

550.54 558.66 A: you know make racial jokes and i think it's because of what society thinks oh every white guy is a racist in some aspect 

557.29 559.71 B: i don't think so i don't think so no 

559.88 570.36 A: well here here i do because we live very close to the aryan community we have a lot of aryan people i uh just up north 

570.41 572.42 A: up towards sun valley area 

571.54 573.25 B: what do you mean by aryan 

573.04 582.71 A: aryan you know the ku klux klan members the skinheads that type of things there's a maj- there's a high majority of 'em that live in this area 

582.27 585.03 B: w- what i can't understand is how people 

585.52 590.24 B: accept it so easily i mean they're terrorists 

588.07 589.00 A: oh 

589.87 591.96 A: oh yeah exactly 

590.41 592.26 B: they are terrorists 

592.49 599.89 A: and see the thing is i mean one of my good friends i don't see him that often he's black and you don't see too many black people
