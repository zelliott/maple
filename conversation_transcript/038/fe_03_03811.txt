7.60 14.00 A: hi um [lipsmack] okay so how do you 

14.05 18.69 A: determine whether it's acceptable or bad taste humor 

17.61 18.42 B: uh-huh 

18.72 20.39 B: well um 

20.94 25.38 B: probably if if uh they can talk about it in front of my kids it's acceptable 

25.13 26.46 A: (( mm )) 

25.87 31.10 B: [laughter] if not totally makes me uncomfortable [noise] most of the time 

29.67 30.75 A: mhm 

30.88 33.26 A: [mn] and how old are your kids 

33.45 37.16 B: pretty young four and a half two and [laughter] a half and three months 

36.71 42.62 A: oh okay [sigh] yeah um well it really 

37.80 38.88 B: what about you 

42.73 55.71 A: [mn] i don't know i guess it depends on the person i mean to me to there's a lot of humor that's in bad taste um and it's like to me it's it's obviously like because of my values and my morals are 

55.72 56.71 A: um 

56.61 57.56 B: yeah 

56.97 59.44 A: different from other people's um 

59.55 73.03 A: and it also like i mean sometimes when you're just with the family and you're joking around and everyone understands each other and where you're coming from like the humor that's brought up in those situations could be taken 

72.89 85.03 A: really badly in other situations with people that don't um [lipsmack] you know don't understand what you're actually saying um or they can't really um 

81.67 83.00 B: [noise] that's true 

85.81 91.58 B: i don't like cuss words in comedy either [laughter] personally it drives me crazy 

85.90 86.71 A: (( uh )) 

88.25 90.94 A: right well yeah 

91.21 92.48 A: mhm 

91.67 92.92 B: [laughter] 

92.87 96.48 A: um and a lot of i mean basically b- 

96.74 98.78 A: bad taste would be 

99.04 109.44 A: i think anything that can really offend someone you know outright blatant offensive stuff that has to do with um you know race sex 

101.33 102.11 B: (( [noise] )) 

109.46 115.70 A: um a._i._d.s all of that that can really be offensive to people um 

114.50 116.42 B: yeah and i think 

116.92 124.88 B: i think now- nowadays they kind of think they have to have stuff like that in order to be funny and it's just they don't [laughter] oh cool 

123.08 124.40 A: mhm 

124.47 128.21 A: yeah that's so that's so right i've been 

128.21 136.63 A: um well i'm a i'm a dancer professional dancer and um looking into acting and stuff and i've been um 

136.57 149.23 A: kinda researching online different auditions and stuff and there's so much um reality t._v. show casting that's going on and you have to be willing to be like 

149.11 162.44 A: just basically like no holds kind of person to be in these and they they say you know you have to be open to whatever and and it's it's just like all of that is so 

152.00 152.84 B: (( yeah [laughter] [noise] )) 

162.63 172.82 A: like i know i don't wanna do that you know 'cause you never know what's gonna come up so it's just like that's really where the world's heading or where it is is to shock and to 

164.45 165.58 B: yeah 

169.23 170.17 B: mhm 

172.92 178.10 A: um see how far they can go you know which is scary 

175.46 176.41 B: mhm 

178.40 182.48 B: do you think there's a a difference in like professional 

178.88 179.67 A: (( so )) 

182.65 186.46 B: comedy and like personal i mean 

187.57 194.98 B: i don't know like do you find if find it more accessible as a professional talking about certain things or 

195.01 196.47 B: does it not make a difference 

195.29 200.30 A: like if it was seinfeld talking uh as opposed to like 

197.99 199.39 B: right 

200.34 206.28 A: a friend of a friend kind of thing um i think that we justify 

200.90 202.93 B: a friend yeah 

206.28 220.48 A: that it's acceptable because of whoever's talking about it um and i think that we would justify it in the status of the person um so i mean to me it's not acceptable 

211.09 212.03 B: mhm 

221.39 225.54 A: [mn] you know either way but i think that 

226.44 227.50 A: um 

228.57 237.94 A: i don't know i think that a lot of people when they they watch seinfeld or or whatever um that they you know they'll say oh it's okay because he 

232.69 234.19 B: mhm 

237.99 240.93 A: you know this is what he's about or whatever 

238.25 240.18 B: he doesn't really think that [laughter] 

240.53 249.83 B: yeah well i was uh watching leno the other night and he was saying you know i make jokes like this and most people know that i don't actually believe that 

245.76 247.32 A: (( so [noise] )) 

249.50 250.94 A: mm 

250.17 252.37 B: (( but it's i don't know )) 

252.49 257.92 B: i know [laughter] there's one or two that may not think that [laughter] 

255.87 257.37 A: yeah 

257.64 264.52 A: that's so that's so true and um the lady oh what is her name she's some 

264.60 265.68 A: um 

266.52 270.19 A: she's on sex and the city she's married to

272.31 279.82 A: yes she i one of my relatives was telling me about how she um 

280.27 284.53 A: how like her her she said that her character on sex and the city is 

284.64 297.83 A: th- is exactly opposite who she is in real life and that she like she wears really revealing stuff and she won't even be naked in front of her husband she says like 

291.88 293.39 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

296.87 299.13 B: but she will in front of the world [laughter]

303.42 304.88 B: [laughter] 

309.31 316.85 A: and it's just it's just it's really sad actually that they can subject themselves that way 

316.55 317.46 B: yeah 

316.81 324.70 A: in order to you know be who the world is looking in at them as and 

323.71 327.15 B: yeah i agree that's uh that isn't on

349.52 350.90 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

350.93 352.21 B: [laughter]

491.81 492.84 B: um 

493.31 496.12 B: although she does learn [laughter] 

496.27 506.05 B: the things that they're trying to teach a lesson about you know they always do the bad stuff first and then they teach you not to do it but she learns the opposite you know she's like oh well that was neat what they did 

502.30 503.55 A: (( yeah )) 

505.66 507.63 A: yeah 

506.28 508.44 B: [laughter]

527.39 529.23 A: oh what was i going to say 

529.68 544.21 A: [lipsmack] oh i remember seeing movies when i was young and not understanding what was going on back then but there was some bad stuff going on and now that i've seen them when i'm older and i hear what i had heard back then 

544.42 557.71 A: and it is bad i'm like wow i can't believe it's just so interesting how naive i was how much i just didn't understand and how much i'm happy i didn't understand that and to realize what was actually going on it's like 

554.17 555.21 B: yeah 

558.08 561.97 A: crazy 'cause i i still remember how i remembered 

558.34 560.01 B: mhm 

561.98 568.77 A: movies when i was young and just thinking like there's something bad going on here but i don't really know what it is
