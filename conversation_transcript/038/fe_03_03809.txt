20.36 22.06 B: [lipsmack] i guess how i put it 

22.24 27.46 B: well i mean there you know there you know humor as long as it doesn't hurt anybody or 

26.32 27.28 A: mhm 

27.90 31.24 B: um offend people is really 

29.41 32.58 A: yeah right you know i was i was thinking the same thing 

32.01 33.89 B: [laughter] 

33.24 36.58 A: yeah anything where somebody gets hurts i don't find that funny

38.23 39.18 A: right 

41.76 47.27 A: yeah right something harmless that wouldn't be offensive if we were part of that group or whatever

47.48 49.93 B: yeah we wouldn't take offensive at you know

52.10 53.05 B: right 

54.95 61.78 B: no i don't either and certain things i mean i think a lot of the comedy i mean some things like 

62.15 67.51 B: double meanings can be funny but i think even like some of the sexual stuff you'll see on comedy um 

63.73 64.72 A: mhm 

66.52 67.69 A: mhm 

67.64 69.17 B: the comedy channel 

68.89 70.18 A: yeah 

69.52 76.38 B: sometimes even that goes too far you know where it just looks like sle- it's as sleazy it's not even funny you know [laughter] 

71.37 72.39 A: yeah 

74.96 84.41 A: right yeah and you know there's some programs where i'm watching it with the family or whatever because i have children and i'm thinking now why did they have to say that [laughter] 

83.68 87.34 B: oh i know yeah where they use it unnecessarily 

86.76 88.48 A: mhm 

87.93 91.23 B: you know like the movie or whatever like you said the show or anything could be 

91.38 97.09 B: just as good without it and they have to take the humor to another you know another level 

97.33 99.16 B: it's not needed 

97.46 98.47 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

98.82 101.60 A: yeah i haven't seen a good comedy in a long time 

100.93 102.96 B: no me either [laughter] [noise] 

102.03 107.66 A: some of my favorites though were probably from the eighties early nineties like what about bob and 

107.06 108.83 B: oh that was a riot 

108.18 111.06 A: oh that's great i've watched that again and again 

110.18 120.93 B: i love that movie i have an uncle who's a psychologist and it reminded me so much of richard dreyfuss [laughter] in the beginning not when he cracked up [laughter] but um 

111.49 113.46 A: mhm i didn't find anything 

115.52 118.27 A: oh yeah yeah he's funny 

119.92 128.56 A: mhm yeah he's one of my favorites bill murray anything with bill murray i don't really find them offensive i've never unless there's something i'm forgetting [laughter] 

125.71 127.45 B: [noise] no me either did 

127.75 129.54 B: you ever see the dream team 

129.41 130.82 A: (( uh-uh no mhm )) 

130.04 142.49 B: oh that was really funny too it's about former you know patients it it's not offensive it's really funny bill murray's not in it but [noise] oh who's in it i don't know but if you ever get a chance it's an older movie from the eighties but it's so funny 

141.87 143.89 A: okay i'll remember that mhm 

142.70 145.71 B: it's along the same kinda of lines and it's um 

146.03 150.89 B: you know that kind of humor just you know it makes people feel good you know you know 

149.94 151.09 A: yeah 

151.44 163.82 A: yeah and uh some things that i find are funny um if they're not taken too far is where people are kinda made fun of just natural human nature is made fun of it's not anything you know in particular but 

159.61 161.03 B: right 

164.11 168.59 A: oh like the old programs like i love lucy and stuff like that that was funny 

167.99 174.73 B: oh yeah and there was nothing in them like you you could you know you just said it was like really nothing that would offend anybody that i could think of 

173.84 177.97 A: mhm yeah i think they have a hard time these days making funny movies 

177.84 183.44 B: i think so too 'cause they take- i think now it's almost like they feel like they have to go so far the other way 

183.01 184.06 A: mhm 

184.43 188.21 B: you know with um you know the sexual or or you 

184.65 185.21 A: (( [mn] )) 

187.04 188.05 A: yeah 

188.34 191.52 B: know that i don't like the real stupid humor either where it's 

190.61 192.40 A: oh me neither mm mm mhm 

191.77 196.87 B: but you know like for an example you know like the bugs bunny cartoons and all those older cartoons 

196.31 197.56 A: yeah 

196.98 205.18 B: now they have a lot of humor that kids would en- enjoy but they did have like meanings that i don't know if you if you've got younger kids and i start watching them again 

205.54 207.43 B: it's almost that um 

207.44 212.36 B: you would have things that would mean like an adult would understand a kid i mean a child wouldn't 

211.79 213.78 A: mhm yeah i agree mhm 

213.16 218.39 B: you know but that was like such a clever you know they had very clever way of doing the cartoons you know 

217.60 220.20 A: yeah it wasn't harmful in any way or anything 

219.46 227.87 B: no and it was you know something that everybody kind of enjoyed i mean my it'd end up my kids would leave the room and my dad and i be sitting there still laughing [laughter] a 

222.01 223.43 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

226.75 228.04 A: mhm

344.27 347.75 B: especially i know as a mother or and working too that 

347.77 354.88 B: you know humor in everyday life you know when you can laugh at yourself and find humor in things that happened around you
