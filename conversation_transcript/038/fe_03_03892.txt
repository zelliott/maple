68.62 69.87 B: yeah that's true 

69.85 83.99 A: that's the way i look at it but there's no sense arguing with somebody over it most people they want to argue about it but you shouldn't say this you shouldn't say that and then it turns into a big fight for nothing that's ever going to get resolved you know what i mean that's the way i look at it 

81.42 82.96 B: yeah 

83.63 94.18 B: i mean i figure you know as long as you're not trying to you know for not having if you're not imposing it on me you know i i can turn off the t._v. i can you know i can change the channel

102.54 116.53 B: you know or someone starts just talking crazy [laughter] and i don't have a choice i may get into an argument about it but other than that i mean the fact if i'm watching t._v. and i don't like what's going on i will just turn it off you know that's simple as that and
