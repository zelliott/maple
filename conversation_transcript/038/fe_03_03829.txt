0.00 1.33 A: lydia 

1.00 2.87 B: hi i'm anne marie 

3.03 4.03 A: (( hello )) 

3.61 4.69 B: how are you 

4.30 5.52 A: i'm good and you 

4.90 7.32 B: good good 

6.47 14.34 A: ah well my general consensus is if it doesn't seem like it's meant in a malicious manner then it's funny to me 

13.96 20.91 B: yeah i agree um i have to admit it depends on when and where too i have two young children 

20.28 23.12 A: definitely i do as well 

20.86 29.41 B: so you know what my husband and i deem funny certainly isn't always funny if they're sitting right there asking questions about it or 

27.31 28.41 A: of course 

28.55 29.54 A: mhm 

29.20 39.89 B: you know if it has vulgar language usually usually language doesn't bother my husband and i too much unless it's used totally unnecessarily you know if it's every other word then i don't need it 

30.94 31.79 A: yeah 

36.35 37.23 A: mhm 

39.47 40.87 A: yeah of course 

39.86 48.76 B: but um but other than that i mean that that's really what makes it or breaks it for us is if the kids are there i want it appropriate for them 

45.27 46.32 A: mhm 

48.35 57.56 A: of course definitely especially if it's in my house you know i i tend not to go to other people's houses and 

48.82 50.06 B: you know so 

52.30 53.16 B: (( yes )) 

58.07 61.48 A: y- you know just put my views on them 

60.95 62.01 B: mhm 

61.37 72.31 A: you know i don't want anyone to think that you know they can't say what they want in their house but if you have me and my family there as guests i think that you should always show some kind of respect and 

71.55 72.48 B: mhm 

72.19 80.72 A: the jokes that you say the things that you say should always be appropriate and for me and for my children you know and i have a 

81.16 88.39 A: very vulgar sense of humor as where i find most things funny no matter what the topic 

82.82 83.82 B: mhm 

86.00 86.85 B: mhm 

89.01 96.45 A: at like i said as long as it's not you know you can usually tell if it's meant you know to be malicious or if it's meant to be funny 

95.00 100.69 B: exactly exactly and i also i have a problem sometimes with humor that's 

100.76 104.83 B: generalizes people you know groups of people 

102.04 103.15 A: mhm 

104.94 111.68 B: then sometimes it's funny sometimes it's not like even things like blond jokes i mean sometimes i think they're very funny 

108.91 109.96 A: mhm 

111.89 121.34 B: but it is hard when you have a blond person standing right there who doesn't think it's funny and it's i guess it's hard sometimes to judge of who's going to take offence and who's not 

121.29 127.28 B: so you always have to be really careful i think in that situation too where making making 

123.50 124.43 A: (( yeah )) 

127.34 134.67 B: i guess there's a difference between comedy and making fun of people or a person whether they're around or not you know so 

129.86 131.30 A: mhm 

131.49 132.36 A: (( [mn] )) 

135.89 136.81 B: but 

135.98 138.99 A: i i feel the same way that you know 

139.45 140.81 A: i if 

141.02 154.60 A: if you're like oh you know you're blond i want to tell you a blond joke you know or something like that and you know it's like yeah ha ha that's funny but if it's thing that you know is going to bother the person 

154.04 155.24 B: mhm 

154.62 158.43 A: then definitely it shouldn't be said you know 

156.68 158.23 B: right right 

158.60 160.93 A: i also think that um 

158.62 159.62 B: (( exactly )) 

162.16 163.46 A: (( things are )) 

164.46 165.04 A: (( [noise] )) 

165.13 169.32 A: things are offensive based on how a person takes it all so 

168.34 170.78 B: exactly exactly 

170.16 174.37 A: you know so you always have to you know if you don't really know a person 

174.41 186.59 A: and you know you're just meeting them for the first time or something like that you definitely have to be careful in the jokes that you say because you don't know if that person is going to be offended you know you don't know how they're going to react to your jokes 

180.56 181.65 B: mhm 

183.88 184.77 B: right 

186.18 187.33 B: mhm 

186.83 190.65 A: you don't know that they're going to think it's funny or whether they're not 

190.48 201.59 B: i agree i agree what about t._v. what about things like sitcoms and stuff like that do some of them go over the line or some i think some of them are just downright dumb [laughter] 

197.92 198.74 A: (( um ah )) 

200.41 204.47 A: i think definitely some shows go over the line 

204.49 206.64 A: but i think that if you um 

207.19 212.56 A: if you have a if you let your kids know that things on t._v. are 

212.76 216.88 A: are made up or you know that they're not real then 

214.22 215.16 B: mhm 

217.18 228.13 A: you know you have a little bit of leeway with that but as far as some of the jokes that they have on t._v. it's just you know that just certain shows aren't appropriate for children 

219.77 220.64 B: right 

227.70 235.75 B: exactly and i think lot of it depends on the time i mean your child shouldn't be up at maybe ten p._m. watching something you know so 

228.15 229.11 A: you know 

230.46 231.59 A: mhm 

233.91 244.64 A: yeah you know my kids go to sleep at eight o'clock and most of the shows that that come on eight and later are the shows that are a little bit racier 

236.99 237.90 B: mhm 

244.21 245.56 B: mhm 

245.12 250.66 A: you know the eight o'clock to nine o'clock hour isn't that bad but it always depends on the night 

248.77 255.82 B: right it's geared for family but again not family with young young kids i i mean it should be family but older family you know 

252.21 253.22 A: yes 

254.04 255.02 A: mhm 

255.13 262.03 A: i'd say family with children in say you know the early teens or the preteens 

259.96 261.84 B: for yeah exactly 

262.07 265.73 A: yeah but comedy also has um 

266.22 275.64 A: has gone further than it should at times but again it all has to do with the circumstances surrounding it you know 

268.50 269.44 B: mhm 

269.47 270.42 B: mhm 

273.71 274.59 B: right 

275.02 276.39 B: exactly 

275.72 279.19 A: if you're you know with a family 

279.14 291.06 A: who has kids y-you shouldn't per se tell you know sex jokes y- you know and then there's always a time for political jokes and there's a time n- not to have you know the political jokes 

283.53 285.24 B: right right 

290.20 291.30 B: mhm 

291.01 304.81 A: you know that's why everybody was getting all the backlash when things were happening you know while the war had just begun you know because yeah the jokes are funny sometimes but you know right now is not the time 

295.54 296.81 B: mhm 

302.91 306.89 B: you have to think about people in their situations and right 

305.11 306.90 A: mhm 

306.95 309.75 A: you know and and their family and 

307.10 308.43 B: exactly 

310.06 317.29 A: if you know their family is there or they have someone close to them who's involved in it 

316.71 321.74 B: right then they're going to be a lot touchier about it because they have concerns um yeah 

318.57 320.07 A: mhm 

320.11 327.08 A: definitely yeah that's why i think that you know jokes and everything else there's a time and a place 

327.06 328.27 B: yeah 

327.69 330.66 A: you know and that always you know [mn] 

330.89 333.77 A: provides this kind of a gauge 

333.42 334.50 B: mhm 

333.87 345.40 A: for whether i will find it funny yeah i may find it funny at that moment or i may not f- laugh at that moment doesn't mean that i don't find it funny i just feel that it's not appropriate for that moment 

344.66 346.34 B: right right 

346.03 350.01 A: yeah that's my general consensus sort of thing 

348.66 349.59 B: i agree 

352.00 352.75 A: so 

353.08 353.84 B: so 

353.54 355.24 A: you know [laughter] 

354.20 356.44 B: yeah do you watch saturday night live 

356.43 364.17 A: i do sometimes mhm i do and again you know some of the stuff is funny and then sometimes it's not 

357.85 358.77 B: okay 

362.92 366.12 B: and some of it's just dull [laughter] but you know 

364.36 368.40 A: yeah it's just that just like you know okay ha ha 

368.19 369.22 B: yeah 

368.62 375.14 A: you know it's okay you know nothing is hilarious i mean the show used to be lot funnier 

374.68 376.63 B: yeah definitely 

375.35 379.88 A: you know and in recent years that's why i say you know it's not 

378.60 386.25 B: that's right in recent years we really don't watch it any more because it just went downhill i thought do you ever go out to comedy clubs 

381.20 382.68 A: exactly 

383.20 384.50 A: mhm 

385.63 386.40 A: i do 

386.41 387.05 B: (( mm )) 

386.84 387.87 A: mhm 

387.79 390.00 B: you know i've been a few times 

389.33 391.37 A: i do yeah i haven't gone 

390.29 403.67 B: i like that venue i think um a lot more than seeing it on t._v. or in a movie or something i- it just i think comedy a lot of times is meant to be shared with other people right there and so i'm i like that atmosphere 

391.98 392.97 A: mhm 

394.53 395.45 A: (( yeah )) 

397.09 398.16 A: mhm 

400.71 401.74 A: uh-huh 

403.04 409.58 A: yes because i think that comedy that's on t._v. should be a little bit um 

409.60 411.09 A: less risque 

410.69 411.75 B: yes 

411.10 421.57 A: than the comedy that you know 'cause when you go to a comedy club most places are twenty one and over or eighteen and over you know because of course they have the like two drink minimum or whatever 

416.73 418.11 B: mhm 

421.14 422.21 B: right 

421.60 433.60 A: and so the jokes even though there are people in the audience who may find some things offensive you know if they do it's kind of like okay you came here knowing what you were going to yeah 

431.06 437.12 B: well you can leave you know [laughter] right exactly you came here of your own accord 

433.54 441.81 A: you know you came here knowing what you were going to get mhm and you know the comedian also he's there you know to be ridiculed and you know 

441.96 449.82 A: and had jokes said on him and so forth so to get offended say because of a fat joke or because of a racist joke 

444.36 446.40 B: (( mhm )) 

449.95 451.28 A: you know it's 

451.77 453.77 A: it's a little bit 

453.91 456.21 A: you know out of line at that point 

455.51 461.24 B: exactly because you put yourself in the situation where that's like anything goes 

456.59 459.79 A: yeah you did mhm 

459.95 464.46 A: exactly um have you ever seen the dave chappelle show 

464.24 465.63 B: no i haven't 

465.09 471.79 A: okay he is very risque with his humor and he's got a new show now on the comedy central 

471.06 472.48 B: oh okay 

471.95 477.88 A: and it comes on at ten o'clock at nights and it's on cable so he can be risque 

477.26 479.71 B: right right oh i haven't seen that 

477.82 479.18 A: you know and he's 

479.09 493.61 A: he's african american and he tells a lot of african american jokes and his friends and viewers all give him a lot of backlash because they tell him that he sets african americans back like generations with his jokes 

492.55 493.70 B: (( i know )) 

493.78 501.30 A: but you know he's african american he should be allowed to say that and the jokes are so funny because they're so based on reality 

494.09 495.11 B: (( mm )) 

500.69 502.50 B: mhm mhm 

501.86 513.03 A: you know he i actually didn't get to see the show until the other day people had kept telling me about it and telling me about it 'cause they know that i'd get that kind of humor you know the risque humor 

510.42 515.73 B: right when jokes are being said do you think it means that um 

516.54 527.05 B: that people have come far enough to be able to laugh at themselves and like that it's not as serious or things are better than they used to be because we can joke about it 

519.59 521.93 A: to laugh about it of course 

525.55 526.57 A: mhm 

526.99 534.71 B: because in in a serious situation where anything is either abuse or bias or whatever sometimes it's hard to 

534.65 543.89 B: make a joke about it and it's not funny because it is so real whereas a lot of now stereotypes means it's not the way it always was [noise] 

535.41 536.48 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

538.52 539.60 A: yes 

543.43 544.44 A: mhm 

544.71 546.14 B: excuse me i'm on 

546.99 548.51 B: (( the phone )) 

548.15 549.50 A: (( yeah )) 

548.59 554.06 B: oh good grief three year olds with no nap today what does that do to somebody talk about comedy 

550.93 553.42 A: oh gosh 

553.70 554.86 A: (( i know )) 

554.18 554.95 B: but 

555.05 557.52 A: kids are funnier sometimes than you 

557.22 567.53 B: they are but i think part of the reason that kids are funnier a lot of times is because quite frankly they're so honest they don't know what's funny and what's not 

557.56 558.13 A: (( know )) 

563.36 564.25 A: (( yeah )) 

564.62 565.74 A: mhm 

566.56 567.84 A: yes 

567.58 574.21 B: because they they just see it they say it the way it is and i think sometimes that's what true comedy is 

569.78 571.91 A: mhm yes i- 

573.54 586.71 A: i- it is exactly and you know perfect situation me and my mom used to share a d- a- a home you know a two family house and you know we sold the house and we're in separate places now and my son he says grandma 

586.53 599.89 A: you don't live here you know you can't do that and it's so funny because you know you don't always tell people like okay you don't live here that's you know [laughter] sets them back a little but a kid would you know and it's so funny that 

588.20 589.46 B: (( [laughter] )) 

598.40 599.66 B: right
