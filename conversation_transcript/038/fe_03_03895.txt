23.44 25.43 B: [laughter] 

23.73 24.29 A: (( so )) 

24.94 27.07 A: now i have to think about comedy [noise] um 

27.55 30.12 B: b- basically yeah k- um 

28.02 33.56 A: all right 

30.64 33.69 B: all this is in order um you know 

33.71 38.27 B: humor is good it has medicinal value or [laughter] you know 

35.07 35.91 A: [noise] 

37.33 41.13 A: if it has value or not what 

40.25 49.23 B: i mean it does have medicinal value right i mean it it really it really works in reducing uh tension it really works in [sigh] 

49.35 52.63 B: um you know many different fields but 

52.34 54.93 A: yeah i suppose it does 

53.44 54.69 B: um 

55.87 59.08 B: where do you cross the line well that's 

56.07 56.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

58.09 62.21 A: yeah what's no longer acceptable humor huh 

62.03 63.03 B: [laughter] 

63.66 73.48 A: um i don't know i suppose if it's if it's deliberately hurtful for somebody or against somebody [laughter] i suppose you could start with that what do you think about that 

71.25 79.30 B: mm yeah probably um [lipsmack] but but most of the time humor is directed against something right [laughter] 

79.29 91.88 A: yeah that's probably [noise] yeah 

79.45 87.46 B: [sigh] or somebody i mean uh it it depends on what or how much you're making fun of somebody like 

87.93 89.79 B: um 

89.74 91.31 B: i i would say if you 

91.26 96.66 B: tend to prefer i mean if you tend to avoid certain topics like you know um [sigh] 

96.60 106.85 B: uh if you're using humor at work and uh if you avoid topics um you know certain topics like you know maybe sex or [sigh] 

99.64 101.34 A: (( [noise] )) 

101.83 109.01 A: mhm 

106.98 112.97 B: you know s- some some offensive topic that might be ina- inappropriate i guess uh 

112.98 118.81 B: that itself would limit humor to it's right place i mean it so that it 

114.96 116.61 A: (( [noise] )) 

117.66 124.70 A: i mean [noise] yeah so the idea of of site i suppose of location matters a lot [noise] 

124.10 135.96 B: yeah [mn] by i mean by topic uh you know by by the feel in which the uh you know the subject b- by restricting the subject basically [sigh] 

136.06 137.89 B: (( uh you know you can have )) 

136.18 139.43 A: (( mhm )) 

137.95 140.47 B: you can have that kind of humor 

140.00 151.31 A: [noise] [sigh] yeah [mn] i totally agree with you because i mean it well if you're at work yeah you wouldn't be making jokes about sex unless you know you [sigh] depending on what kind of work you do i suppose you know it's [laughter] 

149.38 156.68 B: exactly [laughter] [sigh] exactly i'm busy working on a radio station or something i don't know [laughter] 

152.26 153.56 A: and if 

155.93 162.61 A: [laughter] yeah or if if you're a working girl i suppose you have to lighten up a job but 

159.78 162.43 B: [laughter] that's true 

162.73 173.32 A: and i mean if you're [noise] i don't know i mean if you go to [noise] sort of television and see what kind of humor flies or [sigh] what different kind of show if it's a family show you know you're 

171.71 174.87 B: mhm mhm [laughter] yeah so 

173.99 175.25 A: (( not gonna )) 

175.35 181.99 B: that's true by restricting yourself um on on topics according to you know the environment like i guess 

177.55 180.88 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

181.74 183.84 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

182.20 188.66 B: that that would make it appropriate for a lot of um for a lot of people but 

185.73 201.78 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

189.10 192.88 B: um inappropriate again uh res- 

193.55 201.47 B: i don't know restricting the audience so like um you know uh obviously you know that like i mean you can make it [sigh] 

201.49 208.52 B: um adult or non adult like you know if if um we restrict 

208.63 211.32 B: um people who actually hear the 

211.69 221.17 B: humor uh you know that way we can we can segregate the see- i mean because it might be acceptable to some people like adults but not acceptable to children [sigh] 

212.69 214.42 A: yeah 

220.86 222.35 A: yeah exactly 

221.23 226.37 B: so um by restricting the audience or by segregating the audience that itself would 

225.92 227.81 A: [noise] mhm 

226.94 228.64 B: (( would help right [mn] )) 

228.73 232.38 A: [noise] yeah no i totally agree with you i totally agree with you [sigh] i think um 

232.40 240.25 A: i don't know i think it i think though what about you what do you think is particularly over the line for humor what's where's your line 

241.24 253.19 B: see that depends on like th- that depends on what category you fall under right um you know if i- if you're an adult probably your line would be higher than you know if you're a child 

251.03 252.32 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

253.25 261.19 A: oh no i mean like you personally what kind of humor would you not laugh at would you say no i'm sorry that's 

261.25 265.87 B: oh cert- certain topics like probably racial stuff 

261.30 263.10 A: that's just 

265.29 272.68 A: mhm [noise] [noise] yeah that's what i'm thinking 

266.00 267.55 B: (( um i )) 

268.20 278.77 B: mean that's what first comes into mind uh what most like you know something that s- something that makes fun of um a person's 

278.57 283.59 B: you know uh background or you know his color or his you know some- [sigh] 

283.43 292.23 B: something like that but usually if um you know if if it makes fun of a person's profession or you know his age or [sigh] 

286.76 287.35 A: (( [noise] )) 

290.24 293.09 A: mhm yeah like you 

292.06 302.74 B: those are kind of acceptable stuff like i mean that's that's kind of normal and as long as you don't hurt somebody and it's in good taste you know it's it's not intended to uh 

296.82 298.35 A: mhm 

302.63 307.68 B: take advantage of anybody as long as it's it's that way it's acceptable 

307.64 309.99 A: yeah yeah i mean 

310.60 313.29 A: well age what do you mean by age 

313.39 315.09 B: um you know 

314.17 318.10 A: old fuck jokes or are you talking about what 

317.88 331.20 B: no like um you know making fun of somebody who um who is they have all of a sudden aged you know like if you're getting older you're losing say your you're getting bald [laughter] or you know 

322.85 330.13 A: (( [noise] )) 

330.37 332.28 A: (( yes [noise] )) 

331.19 336.57 B: something like that um that's something to do with age right i mean 

335.89 338.73 A: yeah 

336.63 341.37 B: in the older category or you know you having pot belly or you know 

341.53 342.57 B: uh 

341.84 353.41 A: yeah so it seems like maybe it's something to do with power for me you know if you have if you're making jokes based on race and you've got the power [noise] you know i mean like 

353.36 365.78 A: i don't know like really nasty like comedians you know making awful jokes [sigh] awful racist jokes that [sigh] you know that doesn't hurt them but hurts a lot of other [noise] people 'cause they have the power that that bothers me [noise] 

356.53 357.91 B: mhm mhm 

363.43 364.74 B: exactly 

365.69 373.08 B: exactly um so that again is something that we need to restrict i mean because they know what who their audience is 

366.45 390.29 A: (( [noise] )) 

373.37 384.47 B: uh and they should basically select their jokes accordingly i mean they they know who'll be listening to these programmes or to their you know who'll be who'll be hearing them directly [sigh] 

384.88 392.65 B: so i i guess acceptability is you know it it varies completely i mean from place to place um 

393.64 396.82 B: a- according to who exactly is listening to you 

397.58 399.66 B: so um 

400.63 413.02 A: yeah mhm yeah [noise] it's really it's hard to define what's acceptable and unacceptable yeah [noise] [noise] 

405.03 413.49 B: [sigh] exactly i mean it's too it's too broad a term at this point i mean you could say what is acceptable at work or what is acceptable at home 

413.48 415.63 B: that makes it much more 

413.74 424.29 A: (( yeah )) 

415.40 428.56 B: you know narrowed down you know it's focussed okay then we can give examples in that way but when you say general acceptability like something might be acceptable to you at work but probably not acceptable to you at home 

429.28 430.87 A: or vice versa 

430.53 431.47 B: right 

431.17 438.84 A: or specifically vice versa see like i mean it might if another came up to me and told me a really raunchy sex joke that'd be fine i mean 

438.45 440.26 B: exactly exactly 

439.37 445.78 A: at the same time if it was [noise] some if it was my office mate coming up and saying did you hear the one about the 

445.65 447.04 B: [laughter] 

446.04 449.21 A: ha ha ha i would probably be a little offended 

448.99 456.63 B: [sigh] that is true that is true 'cause he's not accept uh you do not expect something like that right i mean from an office mate 

449.52 460.90 A: well actually i kind of do now i mean i have an office mate whose phones are red and i'm thinking of a 

457.84 459.58 B: [laughter] 

460.45 461.85 B: [laughter] 

460.98 463.11 A: (( specific here [laughter] )) 

463.00 477.57 A: but even so i mean even though i expect it it's kind of like i don't want that in the office it's not the place for it i don't feel comfortable with it there yeah interesting so 

468.66 469.69 B: right 

470.58 472.80 B: right so uh 

473.40 474.53 B: yeah so 

478.48 480.29 A: (( let's see r- what else )) 

480.79 488.79 A: honestly i should have paid a little closer or maybe written down what they were told us to talk about 

486.30 499.84 B: well um i mean the topic is pretty straightforward yeah i have not written it down but basically they just want acceptability and um i guess we have kind of defined what uh acceptable is and not acceptable is by different 

490.99 491.55 A: (( [laughter] )) 

491.59 496.32 A: (( yeah )) 

499.27 502.27 A: (( yeah )) 

499.91 503.47 B: um by different fields or different areas by different [sigh] 

503.40 507.09 A: yeah 

503.55 508.02 B: um so um the first thing would we identify what 

508.30 515.75 B: [mn] where we intended to be acceptable you know like um what kind of audience would be using this kind of um 

511.76 516.05 A: (( well )) 

515.99 517.72 B: um but [mn] 

517.90 520.87 B: uh using the kind of jokes or whatever 

521.01 527.93 A: it seems like it's that's the hardest part of humor in general is figuring out what your milieu is figuring where you're 

528.07 535.17 A: you're you're going to exercise your your funny [laughter] [sigh] so if you're going to [sigh] if you don't know ex- 

531.13 532.84 B: right uh 

534.24 547.36 B: because the first thing that always come to mind is if humor is useful or if humor is good you know you can you make people laugh you can actually you know it it it helps them to get better [sigh] you know if you um 

543.08 546.76 A: (( mhm oh )) 

547.49 551.78 B: at office like you know you say use humor to you know 

551.72 562.50 B: make a boring presentation more interesting you know have funny pictures you know have crack jokes during a presentation then [sigh] stuff like that i mean [sigh] humor definitely has 

558.02 559.20 A: (( oh yes )) 

561.93 564.35 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

562.57 570.12 B: you know the the positive values to it and um [sigh] as long as you you you can control um 

566.57 575.93 A: (( [noise] )) 

570.38 582.76 B: you can control the effect of that in a way that you know it's uh it's targeted towards the intended audience i mean that's [sigh] i guess that is the only way you can actually control the you know um 

583.22 587.07 B: uh control the bad effects or control um 

587.22 591.82 B: uh make sure that it doesn't go over the edge as um you know the question says [sigh] 

591.50 599.95 A: yes yeah well you know it's interesting i think that uh [sigh] that this changes over time that what was once completely
