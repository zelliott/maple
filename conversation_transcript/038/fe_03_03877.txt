1.48 3.30 A: [noise] [sigh] hello i'm kevin 

2.97 4.92 B: [sigh] hi my name michelle 

5.86 7.93 A: hello hi how are you 

6.34 8.21 B: hi how are you [laughter] 

9.09 14.37 A: so um this is my first call but uh i i think i have 

9.25 9.81 B: (( [sigh] )) 

15.47 27.96 A: a [noise] i i understand we're talking about the d- when you draw the line between acceptable comedy and and poor taste [sigh] i think i have a pretty uh strange placement for that line personally um 

20.80 22.04 B: yeah 

26.18 27.32 B: yeah 

28.43 32.27 A: i d- i joke about a lot of things that that uh other people 

32.49 39.18 A: find in bad taste but [sigh] for me it's it's more a kind of a thing of uh [noise] 

34.92 36.14 B: [laughter] 

40.01 48.46 A: i i sarcastically adopt a viewpoint that i disagree with in order to mock it and um 

46.19 51.86 B: yeah do you think you do it also to like get a response from other people or [sigh] 

51.04 55.58 A: [sigh] no no i i do it alone so 

55.87 60.53 A: no it just it just helps me reinforce um my true beliefs 

60.11 63.84 B: huh that's an interesting way of putting it i guess [laughter] 

60.77 61.72 A: um 

63.58 65.41 A: [sigh] yeah um 

65.69 70.17 A: [lipsmack] and so i've i've also i've often been called on even by you know 

70.30 82.76 A: uh you know a long term girlfriend or something if i if um if the subject i'm trying to mock would be something like racism or something you know terribly offensive [noise] then then um 

80.05 80.94 B: right 

84.05 92.95 A: [noise] i don't know i don't always i'm s- i'm [noise] sometimes misunderstood even by [noise] people that i think should know better but uh 

93.18 94.81 A: yeah so that's that's [noise] 

95.45 99.77 A: that's how i draw the line i generally [noise] i generally don't 

100.00 103.81 A: but um i think there are there certainly are cases 

100.79 102.13 B: [laughter] 

103.97 107.65 A: where i've i've actually stood up and said like 

107.44 119.19 A: well that's not funny [mn] because of this and that but uh more often than not i tend to give people the benefit of the doubt and i don't tend to surround myself with people that don't deserve it so 

118.84 126.65 B: right that's cool that's a good way of doing it because i usually just kind of [sigh] accept it and in retrospect sometimes i just uh 

127.71 133.60 B: kick myself for not having said something if something appeared inappropriate to me 

132.84 134.72 A: yeah 

133.73 136.99 B: so i just kind of like oh okay [laughter] 

136.09 138.82 A: yeah well maybe you didn't say something to me once 

138.73 140.10 B: [laughter] 

140.04 142.21 A: in which case hopefully we're both okay 

141.64 147.97 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] [sigh] yeah i've got a lot of guy friends that are like uh 

148.74 154.54 B: you know they like to [sigh] it really depends how my mood too actually because sometimes i tend to be 

150.97 153.65 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

154.57 155.86 B: you know a little bit 

156.20 161.59 B: [mn] you know bothered by things a lot more than than at other times so 

160.22 162.64 A: mhm 

161.91 163.16 B: so uh 

164.11 172.48 B: so i i kind of tend to just also remove myself from the situation if it ends up being too uncomfortable for me as well i'm just kind of like okay well [laughter] 

172.44 180.71 B: see you later and and i'll move on to another group of people or you know espec- it depends on the social situation too like if i'm able to do that it's one thing but 

175.53 177.23 A: (( right )) 

180.87 184.38 B: [sigh] yeah it really depends [laughter] 

183.31 184.30 A: true 

184.82 186.05 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

185.90 190.22 A: [noise] what what kind of situ- i mean example of that or 

189.99 191.74 B: um [sigh] 

192.54 199.51 B: i guess y- what it comes down to things that are like racist or or degrading towards towards women too 

199.48 201.25 A: yeah 

200.20 210.88 B: the thing that's that's really the [sigh] the only context too like when when it is a topic that's degrading towards women then i tend to stand up and say stuff and and [sigh] and uh 

207.58 209.40 A: (( right )) 

211.25 216.36 B: you know verbally draw the line instead of just kind of accepting it too because i 

216.42 220.97 B: i guess i have very very strong beliefs about that so [sigh] [laughter] 

218.51 220.27 A: yeah 

220.35 225.27 A: i do too incidentally yeah [sigh] but um [lipsmack] 

221.78 223.05 B: (( yeah wow )) 

225.70 227.58 A: i don't know i th- i um 

229.05 230.49 A: like um 

231.40 233.54 A: (( [lipsmack] i don't know last night um )) 

233.89 245.91 A: uh some of my band mates and i were on our way home from the gig and you know it we're all guys it's country music [laughter] so it [sigh] i mean the conversation is usually um 

241.55 242.82 B: [laughter] 

246.03 250.28 A: well colorful [sigh] and [cough] um 

247.99 248.83 B: yeah 

250.71 252.42 A: i don't know i d- we reached 

253.35 255.82 A: [cough] people were talking in a certain way and i just i 

255.89 259.86 A: and they were saying how oh it's too bad fred isn't here to be offended by this 

259.66 260.91 B: [laughter] 

259.90 264.00 A: and it just and it makes me realise that you know if 

264.38 275.57 A: if i really for me i think a strategy on actually making a difference [sigh] and i don't know that these people actually need a a lesson taught to them but if if that were the 

273.33 274.30 B: right 

276.12 282.21 A: like the more i keep my cool and the more the less um [lipsmack] 

282.69 286.58 A: well abrasive and uh confrontational i am 

286.72 295.22 A: the more e- e- effect i can have you know instead of you know if you make if you make 

289.27 290.17 B: right 

296.24 309.40 A: [noise] [lipsmack] a joke that kind of you know like if people are mocking feminism say oh yeah that whole idea where women are people that's just stupid [laughter] and you know something more like that um is more how i'd like to approach it 

303.57 304.95 B: [laughter] 

308.80 309.74 B: right 

309.56 311.15 A: if possible 

310.37 314.34 B: oh so you like to make like a sarcastic remark in in response to that 

312.77 320.00 A: yeah i guess i like to do that all the time [laughter] but not necessarily sarcastic but um 

315.53 316.64 B: yeah 

320.57 326.08 A: just try to to try to approach it [sigh] in a way that that 

326.21 329.74 A: is is less confrontational and and um 

327.94 328.98 B: right 

329.33 342.91 B: [sigh] well do you ever find that that kind of goes over their heads though like of somebody's head like [sigh] that you making like uh kind of the witty sarcastic remark in response to their their comments and then they're kinda like well yeah uh 

343.19 347.53 B: instead of being like oh you're making fun of me instead of [laughter] 

345.83 348.66 A: right [sigh] i don't know i mean 

348.99 357.24 A: like i said hopefully the people i surround myself with would understand that but i i don't choose all my surroundings so um 

355.73 356.66 B: right 

357.62 365.66 A: i if it goes over their heads then it's certainly too bad for them and um there there may not be too much hope [laughter] 

365.29 366.41 B: [laughter] 

366.23 369.35 A: i mean i encounter people that that [noise] 

370.08 372.67 A: i i certainly have little hope in 

372.83 380.24 A: um and you know i it's something that i have endured in my life too which is you know f- finding these morons 

381.06 385.17 A: lost people as far as understanding of 

382.59 383.66 B: yeah 

385.83 388.58 A: [mn] how humans need to interact 

387.86 389.14 B: right huh 

388.74 391.60 A: and perceive each other but 

392.00 395.84 A: i don't know so what kind of [mn] response do you get [noise] 

392.13 394.17 B: (( yeah that's interesting [sigh] is the )) 

394.37 395.38 B: (( i'm sorry )) 

396.35 397.67 B: (( [sigh] um )) 

398.19 402.52 B: it really depends like i try not to be t- like again like even if i do stand up for 

402.77 409.43 B: for my beliefs or if i do [sigh] draw the line i try not to be too abrasive about it like i've got 

409.32 422.72 B: some friends that are you know they really get [noise] totally offended and like obviously offended and they'll [sigh] then then they make it a personal thing whereas i really try to avoid that as much as possible 

421.84 424.12 A: mhm 

423.20 425.94 B: that [sigh] you know i i just 

427.16 431.90 B: [mn] you know try to uh like call them on it or make other 

432.02 437.30 B: another like hopefully intelligent comment that'll make at least make them think 

437.33 444.67 B: but you know i don't i wouldn't like tell somebody like oh shut up that's that's so stupid or that's wrong like i really 

443.61 445.05 A: (( right [noise] )) 

444.97 448.49 B: really avoid saying things like that just because it's that's not 

445.97 447.49 A: right 

447.98 450.02 A: (( [noise] it's poor strategy )) 

448.31 462.37 B: really oh totally it's not really an argument or anything it's just [sigh] you know it just it just makes it into a totally other level that isn't worth it but [sigh] yeah so i just try to make some type of like [mn] you know sarcastic or 

451.60 452.95 A: yeah 

462.47 467.11 B: [sigh] you know [laughter] rolling my eyes type comment i guess 

465.47 467.20 A: (( [noise] right [noise] right [laughter] [noise] )) 

467.21 468.49 B: (( um )) 

468.65 471.80 B: but this doesn't happen too often [laughter] 

473.44 483.53 B: but it really it really really does just depend on the topic too and and who's there and [lipsmack] i just noticed too that like men are in general seem to be 

483.72 486.03 B: (( [sigh] like have variable )) 

486.05 487.08 B: uh 

487.75 495.73 B: comfort levels with certain topics depending upon like if it's mixed company i think guys tend to censor themselves a little bit more 

495.18 496.88 A: [noise] [sigh] of course 

496.28 497.68 B: yeah 

497.23 502.12 A: yeah a van full of guys for example my conversation last night 

497.88 499.05 B: so 

500.88 502.79 B: right [laughter] 

502.20 504.06 A: and then it's you know 

504.07 512.46 A: [noise] uh joking that that each other are homosexual and then saying oh no i don't like guys how do you know ha ha ha you know and [laughter] 

507.65 508.81 B: right 

512.36 523.49 A: it's not only is it not really funny just from a purely comical sense because it's old it's it's not original [noise] but it's it's like oh [sigh] 

519.45 520.45 B: right 

523.53 526.61 B: but is that like a form of bonding or 

523.68 524.53 A: (( it's like )) 

526.44 532.84 A: oh god i don't know those guys [sigh] i i love those guys and actually the guy who said that i [sigh] 

527.74 529.18 B: [laughter] 

533.25 535.83 A: i'm i'm really beginning to respect 

535.91 546.48 A: and so the way he deals with comedy and and you know this whole subject we're talking about it it could be something i just haven't been able to put my finger on 

542.11 542.99 B: yeah 

546.04 546.93 B: right 

546.52 547.52 A: um 

548.04 558.41 A: [laughter] i would l- [noise] i i'd certainly i've been giving him the benefit of the doubt [sigh] but [cough] yeah i mean it is a bonding thing i mean there is always 

560.07 567.29 A: [noise] but also it's it's not tearing each other down at least i never perceived it as that 

565.79 566.88 B: right 

567.31 571.94 B: huh that's interesting yeah i guess guys do tend to like when they do when [laughter] [lipsmack] 

567.42 568.84 A: (( um [noise] )) 

570.56 571.69 A: (( [noise] )) 

572.63 575.17 B: it seems like when you rib each other 

575.24 583.82 B: [sigh] well i guess it all depends upon how g- good friends you are too like even if you are like [sigh] saying [laughter] deroga- derogatory things about each other it ends up being like 

584.03 588.61 B: i don't know like women would just never speak to each other like that you know [laughter] 

588.54 592.09 A: [sigh] right typically 

591.28 592.37 B: yeah 

592.32 594.23 A: [sigh] and typically men do 

593.92 594.94 B: (( right [laughter] [laughter] )) 

594.47 595.66 A: yeah i 

595.74 596.57 A: (( [cough] )) 

596.89 599.89 A: see [mn] every now and then i'll be r- serious and say something like
