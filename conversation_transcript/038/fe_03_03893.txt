15.19 19.37 B: gosh okay i guess i have to have an opinion about this huh [laughter] 

19.07 23.35 A: yeah it says something about humor about talking about humor and um 

24.49 28.75 A: ah i can't it said it so quick i c- couldn't get it 

25.76 28.53 B: [mn] it's what's line between 

28.60 30.44 B: good and bad humor 

32.15 33.39 A: (( um i'm )) 

32.60 33.39 B: (( ah )) 

34.45 37.80 A: trying to think of something to say about it um 

38.13 39.34 B: [laughter] 

39.68 43.08 A: do you have any comments do you know anything off the top of your head 

39.76 40.70 B: (( i think )) 

42.65 43.51 B: ah 

43.59 49.22 B: it's no not really i mean i guess i would say it kind of depends on the company i'm in 

49.53 51.84 B: [noise] there are certain 

50.84 52.18 A: (( right )) 

51.89 56.67 B: things that i would think are funny if it was just say 

57.23 60.40 B: my husband and i joking around whereas 

60.93 66.52 B: if i were sitting around with somebody i barely knew and they were making bad jokes in front of my kids [laughter] 

67.54 72.45 A: yeah no i-i agree if it was it depends on the subject of what they're referring to 

72.52 73.48 B: right 

74.47 77.61 A: um i i don't really if they're 

78.12 79.87 A: i probably can handle religion 

79.94 84.78 A: or blond jokes or that kind of stuff but i don't think i can handle racial jokes 

84.66 85.70 B: right 

84.84 89.09 A: they don't i mean i can take them in the context but still sometimes they um 

89.14 90.29 A: are offensive 

90.33 91.33 B: yeah 

90.62 92.62 A: depending on the situation 

92.78 97.17 A: and that's not something that i want to you know give out to my kids so if i condone it then i 

93.00 94.42 B: yeah 

97.53 100.72 A: i think that you know is sending a bad a wrong message 

100.68 102.13 B: right for sure 

102.21 108.93 B: yeah i guess i guess if it comes down to ridiculing people based on their race 

110.64 114.72 B: that's probably pr- in pretty bad taste regardless [laughter] of the situation 

115.08 121.52 A: yeah with the war going on and you know what i mean october but with that going on they had a lot of comments about um 

121.90 131.56 A: iraqians and all that kind of stuff and i mean it's it's fine but you know there wasn't it had nothing to do with people you know it was other things so it sort of 

123.97 124.95 B: right 

132.05 138.95 A: all those were offensive in some ways because you know they could be saying the same things i'm sure they are but saying the same things about us 

136.75 141.88 B: right [laughter] or much worse [laughter] 

139.43 145.63 A: yeah exactly so i mean that's you know and we have no control over all that really 

145.80 146.72 B: (( yeah no )) 

146.07 146.90 A: (( so )) 

146.79 147.42 B: (( kidding )) 

148.78 149.56 A: (( i guess )) 

149.21 151.17 B: [noise] 

151.75 154.68 A: i don't think i could talk ten minutes on this conversation [laughter] 

153.93 155.88 B: (( yeah that makes sense )) 

155.93 163.98 B: me neither like this is kind of hard i mean on some level i'm willing to accept just about any joke as long as it's at the right place at the right time 

164.68 165.88 A: yeah i agree 

164.73 170.34 B: so it's kind of hard to think what else to say about that [laughter] [mn] 

170.19 171.23 A: i agree 

171.31 174.96 B: but i'm not sure that we have to stay on topic for ten minutes 

171.66 172.75 A: (( not so easy )) 

175.31 176.19 A: okay 

176.74 178.89 B: i'm not sure about that [laughter] 

179.08 179.96 A: okay 

179.97 186.05 A: well it was very nice talking to you then and i guess are we done or [mn] how does it i've never done one 

184.63 189.32 B: well i think we have to have you not this is actually the third time i've done it 

187.04 187.82 A: no 

189.38 192.36 B: i think we do have to keep talking for ten minutes 

192.48 194.75 A: and does it prompt you or something at the end 

193.46 198.55 B: [mn] uh-huh it comes up and says okay that was ten minutes and you're done [laughter] 

198.35 199.40 A: (( oh okay )) 

199.53 203.42 B: so yeah it's it's kind of weird huh [laughter] 

203.14 207.91 A: it is i get i get most of my jokes well either from my husband or through email really 

207.90 208.84 B: do you 

208.37 210.76 A: (( [mn] [mn] yeah a lot of stuff )) 

209.27 214.24 B: i have a lot of family members who email me jokes but honestly 

212.89 213.90 A: mhm 

214.26 217.89 B: i delete 'em before i read them sometimes just because 

218.38 221.87 B: i get my email at the library and 

222.35 227.17 B: i don't really have time to sit around and read humor [laughter] i 

227.06 229.48 A: yeah i know i i i agree 

229.60 235.78 A: i only read some and people with the pretty much are pretty good about always sending you know good things not 

229.83 230.56 B: just 

235.57 236.44 B: right 

235.94 243.88 A: bad things but then sometimes the the jokes that are sent are the same jokes over and over again and they get old after a while 

243.43 255.33 B: yeah i have gotten every once in a while i'll read 'em and i read one from my sister the other day and i emailed her back and said thank you this is the exact same thing i just got from my sister in law [laughter]

255.40 256.73 B: (( so [laughter] )) 

255.71 259.08 A: yeah they don't tend to look who sent it already and then they 

258.47 261.40 B: right [laughter] yeah it 

259.33 262.07 A: they're forwarding it everybody they've already sent it to 

262.56 265.59 B: gets sent in the same circles over and over again 

265.65 266.85 A: mhm
