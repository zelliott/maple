20.89 25.61 B: i guess we're supposed to talk about when we find it objectionable or 

25.25 31.00 A: yeah um i think like if it's the public 

31.47 33.83 A: like if it's on the news and it's 

33.97 43.07 A: if they're laughing at a company or somebody in particular i think that's crossing the line but i think if it's a movie and they get paid to act it out 

43.42 44.98 A: i think it's alright then 

45.62 48.45 B: right cause usually you know what kind of movie it is before you

88.30 90.73 B: [laughter] 

90.84 97.75 B: well i had heard how you know what kind of movie it was what kind of humour it was i'm not really that into comedy's but anyways 

98.08 104.49 B: i rent almost everything that comes out on d._v._d. and i just thought well just to see 

100.34 101.30 A: (( the end )) 

104.94 106.77 B: how stupid it was 

106.71 108.77 A: (( yeah )) 

107.73 113.75 B: i was only losing two dollars [laughter] and i get my free one much sooner but 

114.10 118.93 B: i can't imagine people paying what they chose to go to the theatre to see that 

119.43 124.34 B: well i guess a lot of people probably didn't know it was know to be like that or getting 

124.46 127.09 B: (( offended by it [laughter] )) 

126.19 126.98 A: (( i know )) 

127.75 131.40 B: but uh i think maybe they talked about like comics um 

132.14 138.36 B: making fun of fat people or different races or i don't know that kind of 

138.53 140.25 B: (( distastefulness )) 

139.67 140.88 A: yeah 

140.98 143.51 A: (( i don't know i just think that tough )) 

143.74 144.79 A: (( like )) 

144.88 148.88 A: if i'm a different race that i'd be mad 

149.35 152.19 B: well if you someone really well know that could uh 

152.85 155.87 B: take it you know personally or something 

157.00 161.85 B: it's probably best just to stay away from sensitive subjects like that but 

163.90 168.33 B: i wish we got an easier topic to talk on [laughter] 

166.74 168.03 A: (( mhm )) 

170.47 173.53 B: um comedy [laughter] 

173.73 177.29 B: have you seen any other distasteful movies lately [laughter]

179.52 181.86 A: have you seen anger management 

181.65 183.98 B: no but i heard that is supposed to be funny 

183.52 185.37 A: yeah it's pretty funny 

184.14 185.32 B: and good 

185.46 189.69 B: yeah sometimes they come out with a funny movie that's not totally stupid or 

190.36 191.55 A: yeah 

190.78 192.53 B: offensive but 

192.65 197.98 B: when i heard that um adam sandler was in it my mother told me she went to see it and it was really funny and i'm like 

198.99 207.93 B: is that guy in it you liked it but then she said jack nicholson was in it too and i'm like oh okay i kind of remember seeing the trailer for that and it did look funny 

209.35 210.16 A: (( me )) 

209.65 217.54 B: but um i don't pay too much attention to them until they're about ready to come out on video because i don't know to the movies much but 

219.69 224.50 B: guess that one's doing pretty well some of his movies i thought were really stupid though 

225.12 226.80 B: like billy madison 

227.01 228.85 A: (( neither yeah )) 

228.17 230.69 B: the golf one wasn't bad 

230.91 231.52 A: (( uh-huh )) 

233.78 234.81 B: (( but )) 

237.18 239.82 B: um most comedies in general i think are 

239.86 242.70 B: (( geared towards kids and that's sort of dumb )) 

243.64 250.16 B: i'd rather see a good drama action suspense anything but comedy 

254.66 257.93 B: [laughter] are we anywhere near ten minutes yet [laughter] 

256.34 258.76 A: (( yeah i don't have a watch [laughter] ))

266.37 269.08 B: tim allen you know from home improvement 

268.50 270.86 A: oh yeah that's pretty funny 

270.03 280.48 B: i used to watch him when he was a comedian on um the comedy channel and then we went and saw him in a comedy club and he was really in person he's even funnier 

280.12 281.38 A: that's cool 

280.93 284.88 B: he does that thing that men are pigs and he grunts and 

285.78 287.42 B: that was funny because 

287.98 294.18 B: that's like how men really are you know [laughter] eating with the mouth full he was 

289.98 291.86 A: (( yeah ))

302.11 304.34 B: looking at all the tools 

304.49 306.41 A: yeah pretty funny 

308.75 312.84 B: i don't think even men get offended humour but it's just kind of 

313.43 315.63 B: flight i guess 

316.54 319.08 B: not really putting them down too bad 

323.11 326.78 B: i can't think anything else about comedy can you [laughter] 

325.65 327.41 A: no um 

328.10 329.29 A: (( i don't know )) 

332.12 333.78 A: it's hard to think of something

357.48 359.31 A: yeah 

359.34 362.02 B: i used to like when he would interview people 

362.49 370.42 B: i just found it interesting because he would come out and ask them questions that nobody else had the nerve to ask them like how much money do you really make or have or 

370.22 372.06 A: (( yeah rich people )) 

370.84 372.11 B: [laughter]

513.34 514.10 B: [laughter] 

522.11 525.50 B: i think we should be able to kind of poke fun of ourselves but 

526.08 527.52 B: then again if you're 

528.46 534.79 B: telling a joke about fat people or something and you know maybe the other person thinks they're fat and if you don't think their fat or
