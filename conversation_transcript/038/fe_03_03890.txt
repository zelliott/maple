8.97 12.66 B: oh i'm lorraine from kentucky nice to meet you 

11.81 14.50 A: well that's not very far from here at all 

14.16 17.07 B: no we're right up the street or i'm right down the road 

15.50 16.58 A: right 

16.59 19.45 A: right you're right down the river 

19.17 24.05 B: that's right [laughter] that's a good word to say it this is my first call like this 

20.16 21.26 A: yeah 

23.67 26.42 A: oh this is my third i think 

25.88 27.39 B: okay [laughter] 

26.61 29.30 A: but this subject is really tough 

29.05 30.69 B: yeah i know 

30.02 36.92 A: the other ones have been more political but how do you draw the line between acceptable humour and 

37.95 38.77 A: what 

38.01 39.40 B: yeah and 

39.52 41.13 B: whatever goes over the line 

40.77 41.87 A: right 

41.47 42.60 B: right [laughter] 

42.65 45.47 A: that's really hard cause i'm kind of a 

45.58 49.01 A: how would you put it body person 

47.53 48.33 B: uh-huh 

49.13 54.64 A: so my line might be in a different place from a lot of other peoples 

53.90 60.34 B: uh-huh right yeah i guess it's hard to know because um it depends on i guess the person who's listening 

60.32 61.30 A: right 

60.66 65.13 B: you know too and what they would think was appropriate 

64.68 68.11 A: well i'm on the internet a lot and i get a lot of jokes 

67.80 68.84 B: right 

68.19 69.79 A: and um you 

70.87 76.03 A: know if they're not funny and they're just gross i guess that's on the other side of my line 

75.90 76.99 B: right 

76.33 83.80 A: but even when some of them are kind of a little bit body but they're really funny i only forward them to certain people 

83.67 89.75 B: yeah you have to be careful cause some people get offended more easily than others and some people 

86.09 87.35 A: right 

90.10 92.58 B: they don't care [laughter] i don't 

91.78 93.44 A: so where's your line 

93.81 107.51 B: know um i can be body at times but then at times not i guess it just depends on who i'm talking with that's like the hard topic um and also you know comedy i think comedy movies that are for teenagers 

99.60 100.62 A: right 

107.57 110.10 B: sometimes they kind of go over the boundaries 

109.55 111.79 A: oh i agree i agree 

110.57 113.26 B: and i don't think teenagers should um 

113.83 114.62 B: (( you know )) 

113.90 119.72 A: no they're too i think they're too young to be able to understand a lot of that and it's it's like 

119.80 129.57 A: in their case i think it's more like bathroom humour you know when more outrageous it is they'll giggle and laugh but i don't think they really understand i think it's just 

123.00 123.92 B: yeah 

129.91 131.18 A: you know they 

130.50 134.74 B: but i think it puts ideas into their head things they don't even know 

134.79 136.32 B: what they're talking about 

135.84 142.17 A: right and it's just the thrill of the thing or that it's different or that it's bad or whatever 

141.81 142.87 B: right 

142.73 148.34 A: but uh you know i i like a good joke just when it's funny though 

148.38 156.57 B: right and i think um sometimes jokes can draw the line if they're um about people or people groups you know like certain 

155.06 156.07 A: right 

156.89 158.35 B: i don't enjoy 

157.67 160.29 A: ethnic groups yeah 

158.97 160.80 B: right or racial groups 

160.37 169.32 A: yeah but some of the ethnics one are funny but they're the type of ethnic jokes that you could share with a person from that ethnic group 

169.10 170.37 B: right 

169.60 173.78 A: those are funny but the ones that really put them down or make 

174.49 177.13 A: them look like fools or something they're not funny 

176.75 181.63 B: no they're not at all and sometimes you laugh because you're embarrassed because you don't know what 

178.11 179.16 A: not at all 

182.25 186.49 B: [laughter] if you should laugh or or or what yeah 

182.79 183.77 A: right 

186.52 187.49 A: right 

187.51 193.22 A: but my list only has about two or three people on it that i send these jokes to in fact 

193.56 200.43 A: um i always sent them to a friend and the only email address i had was her work email address 

199.78 200.65 B: uh-huh 

200.59 203.44 A: now i have a joke where she works 

203.44 204.67 B: oh [laughter] 

203.97 206.51 A: so i have one today and i thought 

206.76 210.41 A: well should i go ahead and send that to her because i don't know 

210.50 211.62 A: (( [laughter] )) 

210.55 212.36 B: (( yeah you don't want to get in trouble )) 

211.91 219.54 A: right but i thought well i'm not sending it from my work address i'm sending it from my home address so maybe that'll be a little bit different 

219.46 221.44 B: yeah i work um 

221.55 231.53 B: at the kentucky commission so we're always we get funny jokes that make us laugh in the office and uh stuff but then we have to be careful who we send it to cause 

224.28 225.12 A: oh 

231.85 234.88 B: you know it can say kentucky commission on it 

234.06 237.10 A: right right and it might not be appropriate 

236.80 241.27 B: yeah and i've received messages from other people that that 

241.30 250.87 B: where ever they work they have something a disclaimer that they have to put on all of their emails that this may or may not represent the company they work for [laughter] 

250.18 251.82 A: oh really 

251.15 254.75 B: yep well i think it's from one one place where 

254.24 267.65 A: oh cause i know i just send the jokes to to my one friend cindy and then there are other girls at work that i know will enjoy them well she sends them to the other girls and i think well that's okay by me 

267.75 275.78 A: you know cause i'm new there and everything and i guess they're used to her doing it and i i'd rather have her pass them along than for me to do it 

270.15 271.04 B: right 

275.60 276.89 B: yeah that's true 

277.08 278.79 B: and well jokes 

278.95 284.60 B: on emails even if they're not crossing the line sometimes they can be annoying because 

284.66 286.72 B: you can get so many of those emails 

287.14 288.36 B: you know that 

288.44 291.15 B: so many forwards it can clog up your mail box 

290.52 296.73 A: oh i know i know and but you know i think that happens mainly when people first are on the internet 

296.34 297.54 B: yeah [laughter] 

296.91 304.71 A: they'll send you about anything and then after a while it calms down and also you get used to you can tell clients 

304.79 307.86 A: what it is at the beginning and then just delete it 

307.43 318.13 B: yeah that's what i do oh i hate those ones i guess it's on jokes and other things too if you if you don't delete this i mean if you don't pass this on something bad will happen to you or 

318.21 319.38 B: you know 

319.74 321.41 B: you know how you have those warnings 

320.68 328.43 A: right or if you pass it on to seven people within five minutes your phone will ring with some wonderful news 

327.79 330.35 B: yes [laughter] 

328.93 332.68 A: i don't call telemarketer's wonderful news [laughter] 

332.25 333.54 B: (( that's true )) 

333.78 335.34 A: (( so i don't know )) 

335.45 342.00 A: but uh no this was kind of a tough subject because it's i guess it's it's really personal 

338.11 339.04 B: (( [laughter] i know )) 

341.83 345.69 B: yeah depends on the people you're with that's what 

344.29 345.51 A: right 

347.32 348.23 B: (( what )) 

347.39 348.24 A: (( and )) 

348.29 349.46 B: right 

348.82 353.00 A: i think may be you have two or three or four sets of stair i mean i get 

354.09 363.12 A: i uh my uncle recently got internet access and i can't believe the jokes that he sends me i mean he's my uncle 

362.71 364.61 B: [laughter] 

363.84 373.03 A: [laughter] he's my mother's brother and i cannot believe what he sends me some of them are funny and some of them some of them really cross the line you know 

372.54 373.36 B: right 

373.37 376.35 A: so uh you know i just read them and kind of 

376.38 382.51 A: delete them and don't pass them on to other people but i i still can't believe my uncle bill does that 

377.29 378.68 B: yeah 

382.78 385.69 B: well maybe he thinks it's so fun to be on the internet 

385.76 386.66 B: (( [laughter] )) 

386.00 391.23 A: yeah maybe yeah he he's not really well right now he's in his 

390.63 391.43 B: oh 

392.35 399.51 A: maybe early seventies and he's not doing well and the internet is one of the things that he can do at this point in time he's 

399.43 410.28 A: got he's diabetic and having a lot of problems like with this legs and you know they keep doing things to save them but he can sit and do his jokes on the internet 

404.78 405.73 B: oh 

407.50 408.32 B: uh-huh 

409.94 413.29 B: yeah i just heard a report on the news about 

413.91 418.77 B: senior citizens who are gambling on the internet and losing all their life savings too 

416.30 417.30 A: right 

418.69 419.71 A: right 

419.06 422.40 B: that's off the topic but it made be think of that 

422.52 437.02 A: yeah and you know that just reminded me of something though about the jokes i think maybe a lot of times you would be more willing to share a joke by pressing a forward button than if you were in a group of people and and did it in person 

432.24 433.44 B: that's true 

437.41 438.38 B: yeah 

438.57 445.64 A: i wouldn't have a problem with it if i thought the joke was funny but you know some other people might be more willing 

445.33 457.86 B: yeah cause it takes the personal aspect out of it when it's just a forwarded email that you got from somebody it's not really your fault you know guess cause that has to do with communication you know 

447.33 448.54 A: right 

451.97 452.95 A: right 

457.47 461.76 A: right i know it wouldn't bother me i know just well my daughter 

461.69 469.63 A: will be twenty two next month but for the last eleven months she's been driving me crazy to go to a karaoke bar with her so i did 

467.88 468.67 B: uh-huh 

469.56 480.84 A: and i took a real risk because i was with all of her friends and i brought my own karaoke c._d. with me and it was kind of a body off color x. rated song 

473.27 474.28 B: oh 

480.77 481.55 B: uh-huh 

480.78 489.85 A: and i gave it to the karaoke jockey and he played it and i sang it in front of all of her friends and i thought she's either going to hate he for it or love me for it 

487.98 490.53 B: [laughter] so what did he say 

489.95 500.71 A: well she said at first she couldn't believe that her mother was sitting there and doing it but after the reaction of her friends who absolutely loved the song and she was really happy about it 

500.28 502.17 B: so you're kind of like your uncle 

502.18 504.99 A: i guess it must run in the family 

502.83 512.52 B: [laughter] yeah cause the younger people always want the older relatives to do things like that but they do it 

510.29 511.60 A: right 

513.22 514.18 B: you know 

513.86 523.47 A: but maybe it's because now my dad would tell a body joke like that but my mother would never do it and i just i guess it's hard for me to imagine my little brother would do that 

523.17 524.51 B: yeah that's true 

524.24 526.45 A: you know it's just so funny 

527.23 531.24 A: but yeah these ten minutes sometimes can get long 

531.19 535.40 B: yeah what like do they just like ring a buzzer after ten minutes 

534.89 540.26 A: they break in and they'll tell you you know your time is up and say goodbye to your uh 

540.51 542.63 A: you know your partner and everything 

542.03 543.16 B: (( oh okay )) 

542.95 543.83 A: but 

543.62 550.74 B: yeah my sister she's the one that sent me the email about doing this and so why why are they doing this is it what people talk about 

546.42 547.34 A: mhm 

548.99 550.02 A: (( i )) 

550.13 553.68 A: have no clue i guess they're just trying to see how people 

553.47 554.34 B: (( uh-huh )) 

553.88 561.79 A: maybe how they communicate and how they react to different subjects and things i know my daughter is majoring in speech communication in college 

560.68 561.47 B: uh-huh 

562.09 566.55 A: and they do some strange things too well i mean they seem strange to me at the time 

566.70 576.86 A: but i guess they're not really in communication is really important and maybe that's why they're doing it and there again get back to the jokes that's a type of communication too 

576.09 577.70 B: right right 

577.27 578.83 A: and it's just uh 

579.64 588.27 B: well i remember after september eleventh there was a lot of talk about what's appropriate humour and what crosses the line cause people didn't know 

586.39 587.42 A: right 

588.53 593.01 B: you know how do you start being funny again and it was kind of a 

591.79 594.38 A: yeah it was hard cause i know um 

594.67 595.41 A: like 

595.89 596.93 B: (( mhm )) 

596.23 598.92 A: he couldn't go on i i'm not sure about 

599.19 599.89 A: (( because ))
