0.32 1.87 B: hi i'm dennis 

1.51 3.98 A: [cough] my name is matt hi 

3.88 5.05 B: (( how're you doing matt )) 

5.09 6.48 B: [sigh] where you from 

6.45 10.53 A: uh i am from eames iowa actually 

10.29 14.24 B: [laughter] interesting [laughter] i'm from the philadelphia area 

11.73 12.79 A: [laughter] 

14.05 25.51 A: [laughter] okay so i think they uh i think they like to record people perhaps in the midwest because we have a [mn] pretty much no accents [laughter] 

24.89 26.80 B: okay [laughter] 

25.78 27.83 A: [laughter] 

27.04 29.27 B: do you think i have an accent 

28.91 39.48 A: uh not really but [laughter] but i uh talked to someone the other day who uh had a pretty th- pretty thick one from new jersey so [laughter] 

38.02 45.09 B: [laughter] yeah i i talked to somebody from texas but they had an uh an accent from israel 'cause that's where they were from [laughter] 

44.02 45.52 A: oh wow [sigh] 

45.75 47.51 A: well sp- 

46.05 48.82 B: [laughter] as far as the comedy's concerned 

48.11 59.21 A: yeah [sigh] um well i'm [laughter] i find those things funny that i probably shouldn't so [laughter] i don't know about you what do y- what do you think 

58.27 69.65 B: yeah i have a pretty wide range of a sense of humour and and as far as finding things distasteful i guess the only i would really consider that is if you're in front of children or [sigh] if the situation is inappropriate 

69.93 73.31 A: [lipsmack] yeah yeah i would say that um 

73.71 77.56 A: [sigh] yeah you do have to limit what you say to children [laughter] [mn] 

76.65 78.15 B: yeah that's for sure 

77.98 81.15 A: but um i guess like uh 

81.79 84.47 A: i don't much appreciate humor that uh 

84.76 86.20 A: is uh 

87.41 89.61 A: just directly um 

89.83 94.79 A: insulting to people [sigh] especially especially if it's like uh 

91.92 92.79 B: right 

94.89 103.30 A: [sigh] well i mean if it's [laughter] i guess it depends on whether the uh the person telling the joke um 

102.36 104.63 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

104.47 109.56 A: [lipsmack] seems to to have some like actual belief in what they're saying 

109.87 113.71 A: like if you say something completely ridiculous it's offensive 

113.74 114.75 B: right 

114.86 124.34 A: then that's fine but you know if you if you uh [laughter] [sigh] you know intentionally uh degrade women because you think they're lower creatures then 

124.58 126.72 A: [noise] i suppose that's unacceptable 

126.51 134.98 B: yeah or if it's a racially [mn] directed and and they believe the thing rather than just telling it as a joke that's certainly not good 

128.73 129.71 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

134.39 143.30 A: yeah [sigh] yeah i guess like generally uh racial humor is not especially funny to me either [sigh] um [lipsmack] 

143.44 149.60 A: but [mn] i don't know if uh i think dead baby jokes are hilarious [laughter] 

148.68 153.32 B: [laughter] i guess it depends on how it's told [laughter] 

152.72 158.16 A: yeah yeah [laughter] um yeah i don't know um 

158.94 167.10 A: [sigh] yeah this i mean there's certainly things that i don't find funny but usually i don't find jokes to be offensive 

167.22 174.84 B: yeah i i guess i don't really find them offensive too often myself but my wife does so i got to be careful with her [laughter] 

175.03 178.30 A: [laughter] yeah what what does she find offensive 

177.92 182.03 B: uh i think anything sexually oriented she finds very s very offensive 

182.10 195.47 B: and just even if it's not a joke even if it's just something i'm joking a- about like if i went to the doctor [sigh] or something like that and i talk about something that's that she finds inappropriate then you know i got to be careful [laughter] 

182.11 183.45 A: yeah 

194.47 195.81 A: [laughter] 

195.39 201.69 B: whereas the rest of my family and friends don't really find if offensive so it's just uh you got to draw that line sometimes [sigh] 

201.74 202.65 A: huh 

202.97 206.93 A: [sigh] yeah i don't know i i suppose that yeah um 

207.31 209.67 A: sexual jokes um 

209.93 214.44 A: i don't think are really offensive but in certain contexts uh 

214.89 218.03 A: [mn] can like can make me uncomfortable 

217.84 226.79 B: right yeah and i think that's what it does to her makes her uncomfortable she's she's from a different culture she's from china so that's why i think [sigh] the way she was brought up is a lot different [laughter] 

224.44 225.46 A: (( oh oh )) 

226.92 228.19 A: okay 

228.76 229.34 B: (( yeah )) 

229.93 231.53 A: hm 

230.07 240.92 B: and i think uh the part depending on what part of the country you're from some people find things more offensive than others but as far as me drawing the line [sigh] it it uh i'm pretty wide open when it comes to joking around [laughter] 

240.63 245.29 A: yeah [sigh] yeah my uh i think that um 

245.36 252.48 A: [sigh] my mother never really um [laughter] would go as far as i would at telling um 

252.57 256.77 A: y- you know offensive jokes or [laughter] jokes and 

255.20 257.87 B: yeah i don't think my mother would either [laughter] 

257.06 260.45 A: yeah [mn] jokes involving death um 

260.49 271.58 A: when i was in elementary school i mean my friends and i thought it was hilarious to talk about people dying in bizarre ways [laughter] my mum didn't much appreciate that 

268.46 269.79 B: yeah 

270.74 272.90 B: [laughter] i'm sure [laughter] 

271.64 277.56 A: [laughter] [laughter] well 'cause when you're a kid you just think that like anything you're not supposed to talk about is funny 

277.28 282.92 B: yeah and y- and you never think you're going to die when you're a kid so why would that be offensive [laughter] 

280.53 281.49 A: (( yeah )) 

282.10 284.98 A: yeah yeah that's definitely another thing [laughter] 

284.05 288.90 B: i tend to be very sarcastic too so i find sarcastic humor pretty good 

288.09 291.94 A: yeah yeah [sigh] yeah it's just um 

292.06 295.33 A: i don't know i i think that's more a matter of uh 

296.17 298.77 A: i i guess jokes that are malicious 

298.89 300.19 A: bother me 

298.92 300.65 B: yeah 

300.43 304.35 A: you know but if they're i mean if they're [sigh] if they're in uh 

304.79 314.86 A: [sigh] you know they can be in bad taste but if they're just you know just absurd jokes or whatever then i don't have much of a problem with them [sigh] like like monty python stuff 

314.50 319.92 B: yeah that's that's pr- uh him and benny hill i like the [laughter] the the english sense of humor [laughter] 

319.19 321.08 A: yeah i mean uh 

321.56 331.11 A: you know there are there are jokes there that some people consider offensive but i mean they really are just jokes [laughter] 

329.07 343.79 B: right yeah that is a problem some people take things too seriously but [sigh] you know some people can take it too far like if it if it could be a joke if you say it one time or two times as a similar type thing but if you keep harping on something then that can become probably a problem 

343.46 349.02 A: yeah [sigh] it seems like it's uh best a lot of the time to uh 

349.63 357.15 A: i mean at least not tell jokes about the people you're with or or do it in in good nature you know 

352.55 353.43 B: right 

356.60 359.81 B: yeah try to do it in a good hearted nature [laughter] 

357.23 358.38 A: [laughter] 

359.43 362.01 A: yeah yeah you got to be aware of 

362.15 365.03 A: whether the other person appreciates the joke 

365.45 366.60 B: that's true 

366.61 371.25 B: [sigh] and there's some jokes that may be funny to men that aren't funny to women and vice versa [laughter] 

366.79 367.88 A: [laughter] 

371.04 380.92 A: yeah [sigh] yeah i would say that's probably [laughter] pretty true [lipsmack] and then [mn] i think though there's a lot more uh 

374.75 376.48 B: [laughter] 

380.99 390.81 A: room for jokes that just plain aren't funny though [laughter] [laughter] i think there's a lot more of those told than ones that are actually offensive 

384.94 385.74 B: (( yes )) 

390.74 395.21 B: true i think yeah i think a lot of people think something's funny and it's not really funny [laughter] 

391.80 392.64 A: like it 

394.62 397.90 A: yeah [sigh] i mean like i [mn] like 

398.23 402.82 A: andrew dice clay i think is just stupid you know [laughter] 

402.18 405.45 B: at first i liked him but he just got old real quick [laughter] 

405.03 410.61 A: yeah uh yeah i mean there's like nothing you there's nothing to it you know [laughter] 

405.80 406.73 B: yeah 

409.90 415.47 B: yeah there's only so far you can go with that kind of humor it may be funny for a little while but it's gonna wear out quickly 

415.52 418.48 A: yeah [sigh] and i mean when people are just like 

418.70 427.31 A: telling jokes that they think are funny because they involve sex or they involve drugs of whatever and they just think like it's funny because of that like 

426.77 433.38 B: right it's like a lot of comedians use curse words and they think that's funny but the best comedians don't use them 

432.66 441.62 A: [sigh] yeah yeah it de- it depends um on how they employ them but yeah a lot of people just think they're going to make their jokes really punchy 

441.56 442.50 B: yeah 

441.70 449.19 A: you know [laughter] i don't know i think though in in some contexts like using curse words can [mn] 

448.58 454.34 B: yeah i agree it can enhance a joke but it doesn't have to be the only thing you use either [laughter] 

451.82 452.57 A: yeah 

453.15 461.37 A: yeah yeah yeah [sigh] yeah there's [laughter] there are definitely comedians who do that so yes say the like 

461.63 465.50 A: unnecessary use of swear words generally 

465.53 472.22 A: i guess i i i i don't think is so much offensive as i just think it makes the person look foolish 

472.12 473.22 B: (( true [laughter] )) 

472.95 474.37 A: who tells the joke 

475.54 478.95 A: [sigh] i don't know this is kind of a it's kind of a 

475.62 476.47 B: yeah 

479.27 481.82 A: weird topic really [laughter] 

480.88 485.78 B: it is it's not something i would expect them to uh to talk would want to be talked about [laughter] 

485.67 495.18 A: yeah [sigh] um because i mean [sigh] well it it might make a difference if one of us had a was more sensitive [laughter] 

494.67 495.94 B: yeah that's true 

495.83 498.85 A: in our tastes but i don't know 

497.88 507.72 B: yeah some people probably could say you know if it involves this then that's where i draw the line but [sigh] i my line is pretty uh it's not a very uh uh strong line [laughter] 

502.96 503.77 A: yeah 

507.31 509.28 A: no [sigh] no no and that 

509.49 514.82 A: line has to be blurred a bit according to what the actual content of the joke is 

514.90 515.87 B: (( right [sigh] )) 

515.24 516.16 A: (( you know )) 

516.44 526.37 A: i mean [laughter] it's hard to imagine but i suppose there's the possibility where a joke containing some reference to rape could be funny 

526.02 531.46 B: yeah i guess that that [mn] certain ways yeah that that's probably one of those that's very borderline [laughter] [laughter] 

526.45 527.19 A: but 

528.74 529.60 A: yeah 

530.97 539.73 A: yeah yeah [laughter] [laughter] i mean yeah that's that's one area where it's something that i don't think most anyone would 

539.81 541.85 A: find to be in good taste 

541.60 542.93 B: yeah for sure 

542.92 544.01 A: [laughter] 

543.11 553.84 B: whereas you could joke about something like torture because it doesn't happen very often and it is something that people you know sort of yeah i guess it all depends on the sit- on what what you're talking about [sigh] 

547.10 547.92 A: yeah 

553.62 559.12 B: yeah there's certain things that but i i think it's just funny how like whenever there's a disaster [sigh] 

559.08 560.18 A: yeah 

559.14 563.38 B: there's jokes out like within days after the disaster [laughter] oh 

563.11 567.64 A: yeah [sigh] yeah i mean my friends and i uh joked about uh 

567.71 570.73 A: mailing each other big sacks of uh 

570.78 575.54 A: powdered sugar after the anthrax scare [laughter] [laughter] 

573.09 574.79 B: [laughter] god [laughter] 

574.88 577.72 B: you could get arrested for that [laughter] 

576.50 582.10 A: [laughter] well yes [laughter] so [laughter] um we didn't do that [laughter] 

578.19 579.83 B: [laughter] 

581.05 582.85 B: yeah that was a good move 

582.61 586.82 A: [laughter] well there was uh there was somebody who um 

583.29 584.23 B: [laughter] 

586.93 596.92 A: [sigh] i heard th- that somebody as a prank uh mailed a c._d. from the band anthrax throughout that time to the june newspaper and uh 

592.73 595.05 B: oh [laughter] 

595.89 597.05 B: oh boy 

597.14 599.89 A: and th- they freaked out 'cause there were
