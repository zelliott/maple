40.37 46.82 A: so i don't know i mean there's there's good and bad i mean you know ah raising it up like helps people on minimum wage but 

46.81 55.88 A: you know if you're if you're into like economics and all by raising the minimum wage it's sends inflation up and blah blah blah blah blah and all that that stuff um 

51.02 52.11 B: mhm 

54.08 60.85 B: right i really don't agree with um the five fifteen an hour right that's what it said 

60.41 63.00 A: yeah do you think it's too much or too little 

62.31 63.76 B: no too little 

63.78 65.20 B: 'cause i mean 

65.77 78.33 B: well with the economy being so bad right now i think that's what people are looking for the most and i mean people will do their job if they get paid well otherwise they're they're gonna slack off like if you you 

75.54 76.82 A: right 

77.09 78.52 A: right 

78.75 79.83 B: 'cause 

78.90 88.96 A: well you're right yeah i mean you know it's a i know with my my parents my mother and step father and they hate going to mcdonalds and he gets all upset when he gets crappy service and i'm like dude listen 

87.85 88.92 B: yeah 

88.98 93.30 A: you get what you pay for chill out [laughter] you know 

91.51 93.24 B: right yeah 

93.28 95.35 B: it's like do y'all have sonics up there 

95.24 96.29 A: say again

97.59 101.59 A: s- ah no i've seen them advertised they don't have 'em here yet [cough] 

100.71 106.34 B: oh okay well i mean it's basically a drive i- through i mean a drive in and um 

105.79 107.66 A: right 

107.14 112.77 B: basically you get you you're gonna tip 'em whatever they deserve and 

112.73 115.68 A: oh really you tip them that's pretty cool 

114.79 117.41 B: yeah because ah their minimum wage 

117.83 120.26 B: like is two something 

119.89 124.45 A: yeah minimum wage for ah waiters and waitresses is like is different which 

122.75 123.78 B: yeah 

124.85 130.06 A: i i never understood that i guess because you know they make tips and everything like that but ah well whatever 

124.95 126.16 B: is lower 

130.22 131.21 B: yeah 

131.46 132.48 B: so 

131.52 132.53 A: (( you know )) 

132.56 135.57 A: what can i say but ah you know it's 

135.58 144.04 A: w- um you know i mean i i guess you know people need to make what they make i mean there's there's a lot of people that you know that the minimum wage is all they got to hang their hats on 

143.90 145.07 B: yeah 

144.41 148.84 A: so i mean it should be fair with what's in the economy and what the standard of living is 

148.61 153.18 B: yeah yeah and if you do get paid less then at least there should be some benefits 

153.67 156.50 B: that you should re- at least receive you know 

155.47 165.28 A: mhm yeah like maybe like tuition reimbursement you know that goes into account or you know be be able to yeah oh yeah i i think so 

159.66 160.56 B: mhm 

161.59 163.55 B: like a bonus [laughter] 

165.28 166.07 B: (( yeah right )) 

165.32 171.53 A: and ah people it's like old school philosophy people think oh we'll just pay minimum wage whatever and then they get upset when things stink 

171.46 183.88 A: if you get people their own incentives and get them stuff to work for it and it doesn't always have to be monetarily related ah people i think will work harder and take more pride because you know it shows that you know that you as a company you care 

171.62 172.66 B: (( right exactly )) 

184.00 187.47 A: that's if i was king of the world but i'm not so [laughter]

341.40 351.55 A: well that's good you got some opinions on minimum wage i mean a- also you got to look at it with the one of the things with minimum wage is ah the cost of living i mean like minimum wage might like take you a little further in 

347.72 349.16 B: right 

351.46 357.14 A: like some places but like new york city minimum wage you might as well forget it

357.32 365.73 A: yup yeah minimum wage is i- ah i think it should be adjusted to like the states depending on you know i mean i think that's a big deal but 

362.46 363.39 B: right 

366.79 373.83 B: yeah i think yeah it does have to do with a lot of the external factors also like the economy and the community and the society 

372.35 373.49 A: (( [lipsmack] uh-huh )) 

373.65 374.64 A: uh-huh 

373.86 377.00 B: 'cause not it's not the same everywhere so [noise] mhm 

375.66 379.49 A: no no i mean like like when i went to school in college i mean 

379.51 387.59 A: the cost of living was so much cheaper there i mean you could buy a house for like one third the cost of that same house here in suburban philadelphia 

387.82 391.56 A: you know so i mean your money stretches a lot further but you know anyway 

391.85 395.58 A: like i said i didn't even know it was five fif- five dollars and fifteen cents now

408.95 410.64 B: (( oh yeah thanks )) 

409.72 413.14 A: that's a good thing make sure that carries with you 

411.26 412.25 B: yeah 

413.06 415.06 B: oh it will i mean 

414.07 417.34 A: because yeah that it a person like you that's rare 

417.99 419.02 B: yeah 

418.16 429.24 A: i mean yeah i deal with high school kids and most of 'em i want to ah you know i i mean this tongue in cheek i want to smack 'em up side the head but then you get you know like my kids at la crosse some of them i'm just like they don't listen 

424.14 425.70 B: [laughter] yeah i know 

430.00 430.91 B: (( yeah they )) 

430.01 432.49 A: and you know as you get older that'll change but

433.35 434.42 A: (( and )) 

434.68 446.49 A: yeah and then you get people like yourself that are just on the ball yeah you you're the people that'll drive ahead you know who knows you'll be a nurse then you'll become head nurse and then you know i mean who knows 

437.94 440.00 B: yeah hopefully 

445.73 449.01 B: yeah and then then minimum wage because of me would be a little higher 

448.19 452.98 A: right and then you know you could be a you then you could could even go into a specialized field so 

453.19 462.75 A: you know that that's yeah minimum wage you shouldn't have anything to worry about there except when you go to college and you maybe want a part time job while you're while you're in school [laughter]

476.64 477.52 A: uh-huh 

477.67 485.82 B: i really didn't know why i wanted to be one it's just you know when you're young [noise] there's always something that you want to be but you have no idea what it is 

485.20 487.03 A: right 

485.97 492.08 B: but then um i got into clinical rotations and i noticed how demanding nursing was and i actually like
