37.87 40.22 A: (( so would um )) 

45.40 53.69 A: unacceptability in terms of something i would pay to see but not unacceptable in terms of something that i think they should censor 

53.49 58.67 B: okay okay i hear ya i can i can go along with that you know 

58.34 60.15 A: is he still around 

59.67 65.89 B: uh yeah but he's uh fallen from uh the good graces in terms of current activity 

63.65 64.73 A: i don't think

72.91 75.08 B: (( uh okay )) 

75.02 76.77 A: but then 

76.80 80.76 B: mhm 

76.93 79.96 A: i don't agree with that statement because

91.62 95.01 B: uh let's see who do we start with uh 

96.50 98.54 B: (( mhm )) 

99.77 101.36 A: this is a tough topic 

101.88 114.62 A: because i'm so reluctant to impose censorship or you know it's almost like the superior court ruling whether potter stewart's ruling when he talked about pornography he knows what it is but he doesn't know how to define it 

102.05 103.22 B: yeah it is 

105.40 106.93 B: mhm 

110.15 111.06 B: right 

114.09 115.33 B: right 

114.71 117.89 A: well that's how i think we could define unacceptable humor 

117.64 118.99 B: (( oh okay )) 

119.34 120.94 A: do you go along with that 

120.72 123.71 B: yeah i can live with that i can live with that you know 

123.96 126.92 B: like holocaust humor that's another you 

127.65 128.68 B: know 

128.29 132.43 A: i would agree with that to a large extent 

129.84 131.20 B: mhm 

132.10 135.51 B: okay unless you're talking about the well let's see we're got uh 

134.92 137.62 A: but you know what one of my funniest lines ever 

137.30 138.40 B: uh-huh 

137.69 140.31 A: was i was at a bar 

140.65 144.41 A: and i criticized the movie chorus line 

145.03 146.35 A: and 

145.50 146.67 B: uh-huh 

146.57 148.42 A: the person said 

149.09 161.84 A: that's because you're not in theater or you'd appreciate this you would appreciate the movie and i said listen i was never in the holocaust but i was in a concentration camp but i i can tell a good holocaust movie when i see one 

152.12 153.11 B: uh-huh 

153.82 154.87 B: okay 

158.62 159.63 B: mhm 

161.68 163.82 B: right right 

162.69 164.59 A: now was that unacceptable 

164.43 166.83 B: okay uh no 

167.37 170.01 A: so then holocaust humor might not be off limits 

170.11 171.24 B: mhm 

171.82 178.73 B: well i guess if it hits home to a person then it might not be but uh it's like you look at don rickles he insults everybody 

178.60 180.46 A: yeah but none of it is 

178.76 179.56 B: (( but )) 

179.85 181.23 B: mhm 

180.60 183.08 A: it can be obnoxious without being offensive 

182.66 188.78 B: okay okay i hear ya i guess everything's presentation when you really get down to it you know 

189.58 192.70 B: if you do it the right way hey you can get away with it 

192.84 196.70 A: i think any joke about president bush is perfectly legitimate 

196.66 207.50 B: yeah that's because he's unlegitimate [laughter] yeah [laughter] he's like the bird in the bush as opposed to the one in the hand 

198.46 202.94 A: [laughter] yeah that's right [laughter] 

203.12 204.58 A: [laughter] 

205.37 210.03 A: yeah any joke about him any political joke is legitimate 

207.53 208.67 B: (( oh yeah yeah )) 

208.75 210.61 B: [noise] he's 

210.82 212.76 B: (( a joke you know what i mean )) 

212.18 216.36 A: i mean i loved clinton i used to get a kick out of all those clinton jokes 

215.00 215.56 B: (( [cough] )) 

215.84 220.75 B: uh-huh okay oh well he was uh good material yeah he he [cough] 

220.24 227.99 A: although you know what i did find leno offensive after a while he was the president of the united states and it was time to let up a little bit 

225.75 226.87 B: uh-huh 

227.42 228.95 B: okay yeah 

228.31 233.19 A: uh so that it became you know what i think leno and letterman on 

233.25 237.30 A: the constant fixation of clinton's sexual misbehavior 

235.93 237.19 B: mhm 

237.60 239.67 A: bordered on unacceptability 

239.60 241.06 B: yeah they did kind of 

239.99 242.11 A: but not to the point where i would censor it 

242.12 247.37 B: yeah they did kind of run it into the ground i mean it's like uh [cough] but i did hear a good one 

247.27 248.44 A: what was that 

247.46 251.13 B: you know bill clinton said uh he didn't 

251.44 256.31 B: he didn't ask uh you know monica to uh uh 

256.14 268.25 B: lie he asked her to kneel you know i thought that was pretty cute but uh [laughter] bill clinton said that he didn't ask monica lewinsky to l- lie he asked her to kneel 

260.21 261.76 A: what was it say it again 

267.55 268.85 A: oh that's cute 

268.25 271.77 B: (( you know what i mean i i was okay with that )) 

269.37 270.57 A: (( i )) 

271.26 274.49 A: oh i think the best was did you see the latest poll 

272.49 274.05 B: [laughter] 

274.28 275.34 B: (( uh-huh )) 

274.76 279.86 A: ninety percent of the american american women said they would not sleep with clinton again 

279.41 285.50 B: uh-huh oh really [laughter] that's not bad 

280.70 284.06 A: [laughter] 

284.97 286.14 A: that's good 

285.52 287.75 B: that's not bad mhm 

287.24 289.81 A: (( unacceptable uh humor )) 

290.23 291.90 A: well there's obscenity 

291.59 293.98 B: uh-huh okay okay 

293.79 296.65 A: uh going beyond lenny bruce i guess 

296.66 297.76 B: okay 

297.25 308.66 A: but then you know i see stuff like i've seen robin williams i'm really i'm reaching here to find unacceptable humor even though i know i mean i this was a robin you williams special on 

305.36 306.79 B: mhm 

309.17 310.44 A: h._b._o. 

310.15 311.13 B: okay 

311.17 314.50 A: that i'd be embarrassed to watch with my mother but it was funny 

314.11 323.80 B: yeah robin's great i mean the two i mean just in terms of you know free form association humor he's like the best i've seen besides jonathan winters 

324.49 327.15 A: jonathan winters was great yeah 

325.71 329.54 B: sick sick man i loved him [laughter] 

327.53 330.69 A: he was really terrific he really was terrific 

330.24 332.04 B: (( yeah )) 

331.14 335.46 A: i guess because of the racial sens- sensitivities in the country 

335.09 337.06 B: mhm 

335.69 337.77 A: (( anti black humor is off limits )) 

337.36 341.96 B: okay okay [noise] mhm that oh yeah 

338.64 340.27 A: and i don't blame them 

342.00 346.00 B: oh yeah it's uh little thing you know 

343.79 344.79 A: so 

346.49 350.97 B: but let me think of who else i can think of that was really a wild 

351.12 354.23 B: uncontrollable comedian um 

355.02 356.21 B: mhm 

355.58 361.28 A: and then the other sources for humor now are the internet and i guess there's unacceptable humor there i mean 

361.01 362.26 B: mhm 

361.44 365.34 A: if they are asked me about unacceptable scam i could r- r- 

365.33 367.76 B: [laughter] 

365.61 368.20 A: [laughter] i could talk for hours 

367.81 371.27 B: yeah that's it a cop of church you know what i mean 

372.82 373.95 A: (( uh )) 

374.28 376.30 B: mhm 

376.42 381.77 A: i think we're concluding then that humor is by definition has to almost be acceptable 

382.44 386.04 B: yeah you know it's like uh 

387.29 392.13 B: [noise] i can't really even think of off hand too many outrageous you know what i mean 

390.06 393.44 A: the fact that it's humor the fact that it's humorous 

392.30 396.07 B: mhm 

394.12 403.04 A: means that it's some- sometimes poking fun of it at itself i'm thinking of the nazi movies where they portrayed the uh jews in in the most 

397.73 398.86 B: (( [noise] )) 

402.49 403.91 B: mhm 

403.92 411.22 A: outrageous manner there was no humor to that i mean they didn't even use humor as an instrument to deliver their message 

405.16 406.07 B: (( right )) 

406.49 407.82 B: right 

410.78 413.14 B: mhm okay 

413.59 421.42 A: so where you use humor to deliver a message i mean i'm sure we've heard offensive jokes i just don't know them 

418.13 424.10 B: mhm sure sure that that's always been there you know 

423.43 427.87 A: i mean even some of those sick jokes about you know paraplegics and they're fine 

427.65 428.73 B: yeah 

428.11 431.21 A: they don't hurt anybody you wouldn't tell one to a paraplegic 

430.82 431.90 B: uh-huh 

431.52 434.20 A: although they'd probably be offended that you didn't tell them
