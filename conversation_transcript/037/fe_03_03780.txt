152.71 153.97 A: yeah 

152.84 158.94 B: but well i i guess that's that's your opinion on this debate then the one they want us to [laughter] 

156.27 161.51 A: i guess yeah i don't know but um 

161.77 167.33 A: i mean there must be some things that are in bad taste some things may not just be funny also

170.42 172.25 A: (( i i don't know i just uh )) 

174.51 176.35 A: the [mn] 

176.42 183.02 B: [cough] yeah well i would i would uh mine could be that um you know stuff that is in bad taste 

183.09 186.94 B: uh is usually uh that which targets other communities or people 

187.08 191.45 A: yes well that that that i definitely i would agree with that and i don't 

192.13 197.30 A: i don't i don't find that funny at all and the trouble is that um 

198.11 209.72 A: i don't find the thing is that it's it's what's going on in the world today is uh i'm i'm very uh left wing you know in my beliefs 

209.50 210.81 B: mhm 

210.15 211.89 A: and so i 

212.00 223.13 A: i would tend to to make fun of um very much so um the illegitimate uh bush dictatorship that we have in this country now 

218.62 221.63 B: (( mhm )) 

223.92 227.98 A: i would tend to make fun of them but i would definitely not make fun of uh 

227.99 230.52 A: other cultures as as i believe 

230.60 234.15 A: they do they're so arrogant that they 

232.30 234.21 B: [mn] 

234.05 246.45 A: then tend to make fun of anyone whom they say is is an enemy they're they're the ones who made made them the enemy the bush type people who have been who have been here for a long time it's the ultimate right wing 

246.55 250.57 A: which is totally messing up everything in this world in my opinion 

250.93 252.01 A: they 

252.47 255.74 A: they would tend to have kind of humor which would uh 

256.16 261.51 A: which would make fun of other of other of other people and other cultures which i would 

261.85 264.84 A: i think we're all together on this planet and uh 

264.51 267.67 B: (( right )) 

264.92 270.98 A: we should show humility and we especially the united states which is a big bully 

271.23 276.30 A: and uh we should show humility and just try to get along with everybody 

276.48 281.99 B: right no that's that's where i totally agree with you about uh you know the unnecessary 

282.07 288.70 B: uh right wing policies you know followed by this administration i mean they're totally unacceptable to most liberal 

284.45 285.41 A: mhm 

289.21 293.55 B: uh thinkers really for any thinkers for that matter as you just said 

290.92 291.88 A: mhm 

293.13 294.27 A: (( sure )) 

293.68 296.75 B: we are becoming more and more of a bully internationally i mean 

296.80 299.39 B: it's gonna come back to us apparently some day 

298.66 301.73 A: exactly i know i know and they 

301.79 305.48 A: they just uh it's just unbelievable 

305.51 308.17 A: i just hope that we i don't know 

307.56 309.96 B: mhm 

308.60 317.89 A: i don't know there was there wasn't a i don't know if what's gonna happen it's it's very uh it's very bad very very bad i mean they have such control now they have such a 

312.89 314.95 B: (( yeah )) 

318.01 320.03 A: control that uh 

320.19 325.64 B: what what do you rate uh the president's chances in the coming election two thousand and four 

324.34 335.91 A: well that's the thing the question is will there even be an election 'cause there wasn't one in two thousand i mean that was a total fraud the way he became uh elected 

334.50 336.88 B: [laughter] 

335.94 341.29 A: and who knows what's gonna happen in two thousand and four but they they you know for a long time 

341.06 351.41 A: they had such control that that no matter what candidate they all sort of buckle under to the to the military to the military who's really running things i believe and the 

351.27 356.48 A: the national security state you might say is always in control no matter who is there 

357.08 358.21 B: yeah 

357.22 359.21 A: (( i mean )) 

359.55 367.71 A: uh so i don't know there there might be an election but it'll be between candidates that are almost the same you know so there won't be much of a choice 

365.92 372.46 B: yeah that that's that's always the uh plan in america for several elections now right 

371.89 373.76 A: (( sure mhm )) 

372.61 380.90 B: i mean uh but still the people who propose that to suggest that both the candidates have been uh relatively liberal 

381.11 385.76 B: rather than conservative like we have uh uh the situation right now 

386.56 387.72 B: um 

387.79 400.08 B: i mean the the so called uh um spectrum of political ideology in this country is kind of skewed towards the liberal side because the most liberal even though compared to western europe i would 

400.11 404.01 B: say we are much more conservative in america right 

403.79 405.91 A: (( right i would yeah i would think so )) 

404.78 408.07 B: i mean but but when we talk of left and right in this country 

407.97 421.07 B: we don't mean it in uh we don't mean as much right as say people from west asia might the middle east might uh you know i mean right is uh is certainly far east in asia as well 

421.35 427.73 B: so i mean do you do do you think that's funny [laughter] 

426.59 431.32 A: i don't know i can't so what's funny i mean it's um 

432.59 440.53 A: it's not funny laugh out loud but some things are ironic around and a lot of things are very ironic 

442.85 450.14 A: um but i don't not so much that's so funny now as far as far as politics and those things go you know 

450.93 453.30 A: (( but i but um )) 

455.01 458.85 A: i don't know i mean but no no i agree with you that about 

458.91 467.16 A: as far as i guess we're supposed to speak on this one topic i i i agree with you that making fun of other nationalities 

467.38 474.58 A: or something you know is completely unnecessary there are ways to be funny without doing that at all you know 

475.68 478.39 B: do you watch uh the tonight tonight show
