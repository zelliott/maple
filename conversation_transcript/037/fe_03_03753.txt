0.69 2.59 B: (( [noise] hello )) 

2.44 4.32 A: [noise] hi i'm emily 

4.12 5.72 B: i'm steve 

5.29 6.08 A: hi 

5.87 8.32 B: and i'm in las vegas just 

8.25 13.72 A: [laughter] i'm in oklahoma unfortunately [laughter] 

10.35 11.09 B: (( oh )) 

11.22 12.13 B: [laughter] 

13.53 16.66 B: [sigh] okay minimum wage we're supposed to talk about 

16.07 17.17 A: (( mhm )) 

16.85 22.87 B: okay um i think the minimum wage is even at that price is way too low 

22.71 25.35 A: oh yeah i think it's always been too low 

24.98 30.91 B: yeah and uh i remember back when it was like a dollar forty nine or something 

30.27 31.53 A: [laughter] 

30.70 44.99 B: and kinda dates me but [lipsmack] uh but minimum wage is is is way too low right now it should be i would think close to eight dollars so any kind of increase they get right now would be uh welcome 

44.39 55.97 A: yeah and even like waitresses they don't even make minimum wage they make a certain rate like when i was a waitress it was three fifteen an hour and then you got your tips 

55.47 56.59 B: mhm 

55.95 60.35 A: and i thought something was always kinda fishy about that i thought that wasn't 

60.63 62.00 A: but i mean i guess 

62.50 63.92 A: most people 

64.35 68.22 A: who are making minimum well no because there's a lot of 

68.95 77.09 A: older people making minimum wage too but you know for the teenagers it's okay i mean if they're still living with their parents and stuff [laughter] but 

76.17 82.38 B: that would be yeah i guess that would be okay but if you look around at jobs here in las vegas 

82.53 88.93 B: they base it a lot of 'em on minimum wage there was a place up the street that 

89.10 98.45 B: uh there was a time i was out of work all and they wanted the minimum wage they were offering like five s- whatever the minimum wage was 

97.85 99.09 A: (( mhm )) 

98.44 105.01 B: and uh you know which is ridiculous because it's just you know you you [mn] 

105.31 111.95 B: five you know it's it's not it's not even a living wage you can't do anything after taxes there's nothing left 

109.10 110.04 A: (( uh-uh )) 

111.34 113.22 A: no there's really not 

112.60 113.88 B: (( yeah )) 

113.62 114.55 A: (( mnh mnh )) 

115.12 117.97 A: no and i don't know i i 

118.31 120.73 A: that's why so many you know 

120.96 134.15 A: small families and single parents you know make minimum wage and then they end up having to get welfare and stuff if they would raise the minimum wage then maybe some of these people wouldn't be on welfare 

134.82 135.95 B: i agree 

135.65 137.21 A: (( yeah so )) 

136.65 143.99 B: and the any kind of a person that's good uh is worth the more the extra money 

143.35 146.60 A: mhm yeah definitely 

147.91 148.72 A: (( um )) 

150.49 154.56 A: [sigh] i don't know i i don't work right now so 

154.65 156.39 A: i'm in college so 

155.70 159.45 B: (( mhm are [mn] you're uh have you gone b- are you )) 

159.77 166.85 B: in school as as such as going along in school uh continuing on in school or did you go back to school 

166.90 173.20 A: i got married at sixteen right out of high school and now i'm twenty six and this is my 

169.58 170.46 B: mhm 

173.50 174.36 A: this is 

174.57 181.21 A: i'm almost done with my first year of college so i stopped and had a child and um 

176.94 177.82 B: mhm 

181.23 182.97 A: then my um 

183.29 187.51 A: and now that my husband's gone overseas i've gone back to college and 

186.79 188.12 B: mhm 

187.96 194.47 A: going to but my husband's not the type that [sigh] says i have to work so 

195.34 200.95 A: but even the military for what for working twenty four hours a day you don't make 

201.18 203.36 A: [laughter] make much 

202.91 205.73 B: no i'm sure they don't get paid enough either 

203.74 204.54 A: (( no )) 

205.04 208.49 A: no not for what they do but 

208.68 213.79 A: i don't know i guess if they raise the minimum wage then that would raise everybody's prices on your 

213.87 220.80 A: on your goods too you know then it would raise mcdonald's prices it would raise walmart's prices it would you know so 

220.76 223.85 B: i'm not sure mcdonald's actually pays minimum wage 

223.83 225.06 A: oh really 

224.76 228.82 B: yeah i think they may pay a little more or depending on where they are 

228.49 229.36 A: uh-huh 

229.91 232.51 A: well that that's nice then [laughter] 

233.01 235.97 A: so i wonder who gets minimum wage right now just 

235.32 240.03 B: well let's see p- uh people that work in ice cream stores 

239.61 240.72 A: mhm 

240.11 241.68 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

241.97 245.47 B: a lot of people here in las vegas [laughter] 

245.08 247.02 A: [laughter] 

246.25 252.85 B: because uh the um there's a lot of people here without a without jobs but there's also a lot of 

253.25 257.27 B: uh people going back into the workforce retired people 

256.64 258.05 A: mhm 

257.35 264.30 B: and the cost of living here is less so they can get away with um paying less here 

259.92 260.75 A: right 

264.24 265.24 A: [mn] 

265.69 270.29 A: that's funny because there is so much money in las vegas [laughter] 

268.79 280.15 B: yeah i know but i'm do- i'm doing a job that i did in the on the east coast and i'm being paid uh several dollars an hour less per hour here than i was back there 

279.54 280.78 A: oh man 

280.53 281.73 B: yeah 

281.57 286.18 A: that's just i think it should be flat across the board and that's [laughter] 

286.41 294.15 A: but then again the military gets paid differently according to where we are stationed we get basic uh 

291.06 292.32 B: mhm 

294.53 298.27 A: [lipsmack] we get something called c._o._l._a. um cost of living 

298.76 305.97 A: something at the end cost of living accommodations or something so we get paid more according to where we live 

306.18 308.24 A: so i guess well yeah it's right 

307.98 312.58 B: incentive to take more hazardous pay i mean hazardous areas i guess 

308.34 309.40 A: [laughter] 

312.13 313.90 A: yes yeah 

314.20 315.72 A: yeah so 

315.76 320.72 B: but you also don't have options on where they you go to do 

319.94 326.49 A: no no we don't [laughter] no so but 

327.24 329.48 A: oh well that's the price you pay 

329.61 330.98 A: [laughter]
