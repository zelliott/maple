0.64 2.90 A: my name is todd vinegar 

2.82 4.81 B: hi uh my name's eddie 

5.11 6.25 A: hi eddie 

6.02 6.99 B: how're you doing 

6.93 8.45 A: hey just fine 

8.59 9.73 A: um 

10.00 12.83 A: you know that the topic is about comedy 

12.10 16.17 B: uh kind of i i'm not exactly sure 

16.71 25.80 A: well the question is how do you how do you each draw the line between acceptable humor and humor that is in bad taste 

25.40 26.38 B: uh-huh 

26.66 27.91 A: [laughter] 

29.44 31.51 A: um i guess 

32.22 35.80 A: and i'm looking at the paper here so i'll i can go ahead and start 

35.07 35.98 B: okay 

36.02 37.10 A: um 

39.70 50.10 A: um i think that i i like i'll watch saturday night live sometimes and i like the comedy that they do it's just sometimes like 

50.23 54.58 A: um it gets kinda gruesome like they show a lot of blood 

54.72 56.03 A: um 

56.25 60.09 A: and i mean you know it's it's okay like i remember um 

60.15 67.24 A: dan ackroyd and [noise] who somebody else did a i think dan ackroyd dressed up as um 

68.03 71.52 A: um one of these cooks one of these 

72.22 81.56 A: yeah cooks and he he like accidentally cut his finger off and blood started shooting out everywhere or something that was that was 

79.34 81.87 B: [laughter] oh yeah i know what you're talking about 

81.71 84.05 A: yeah that was funny 

83.32 94.23 B: but see he was actually he was doing julia child he was supposed to be imitating julia child and it was kind of a joke because she has like a reputation for being very clumsy and 

86.11 87.74 A: yeah julia child [noise] 

93.69 95.18 A: oh really 

94.20 105.38 B: and you know she she frequently would drop things on her show so he was kind of just doing like an exaggerated take on on julia child i think for for me the line 

105.61 120.07 B: between offensive and you know things that are funny but potentially offensive comes in where what is the audience you know if if the audience is is gonna be people that are going to be offended by something then i think 

113.41 115.28 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

120.06 130.23 B: you know it could be the same exact joke twice but in front on an audience that's going to be offended i think it's offensive and in front on an audience that's maybe you know 

126.40 128.10 A: mhm 

130.21 138.22 B: you know more open to hearing those kind of jokes then i think it's not so offensive so you know for me that's the the big distinction is 

138.35 140.05 B: you know if i go to 

140.11 142.28 B: if i got to a uh 

142.69 148.45 B: a black neighborhood and i make jokes about black people and i'm a white person that's gonna be 

147.45 148.49 A: mhm 

148.32 158.97 B: you know taken offensively but if i if i go if i'm a black person and i go to a black neighborhood and i'm making fun of myself then people are gonna receive it completely differently so 

150.34 151.44 A: right 

159.12 163.62 A: like um chris rock like chris rock 

159.19 170.09 B: you know for me it depends on the audience yeah right like him exactly if a white guy you know was telling those jokes to a white audience then that would be offensive i think 

169.61 171.51 A: mhm 

170.12 177.69 B: but uh if if it's uh it just depends on you know the person and their credibility i think to some extent 

177.55 182.51 A: yeah i think chris rock like got some controversy about using the n word 

182.09 183.03 B: uh-huh 

183.05 187.13 A: and he was like you know they were asking him um 

187.54 188.57 A: you know 

188.79 194.28 A: why do you do you think it's degrading to your to your race to use the 'n' word 

194.44 199.43 A: and he said well there's he said i'm 

199.83 212.79 A: he said i'm not a nigger he said and he said but there are blacks there are black people who are and there's also black people who aren't you know 

212.37 213.52 B: right 

212.93 219.84 A: and i thought that was interesting that at the time you know he was he was drawing a distinction within his own race 

218.98 228.73 B: yeah i think that's valid i think you know the words themselves aren't offensive it's the ideas behind the words and the concepts behind the words you can say something 

225.63 226.45 A: mhm 

228.64 240.46 B: that's offensive without using any bad words or any restricted words and it can be offensive or you can something with a lot of bad words in it and have it not be offensive i think it all depends on 

238.37 238.95 A: (( [noise] )) 

240.46 244.17 B: you know the ideas that you have behind the words 

243.98 244.96 A: yeah 

244.34 248.33 B: if you're the kind of person that you think black people are inferior 

248.49 256.00 B: to white people no matter how you say that even if you say it extremely politely it's still a very offensive concept 

253.67 254.61 A: mhm 

256.23 257.65 A: yeah 

257.72 270.19 A: i usually i usually like humor that's witty and i mean i don't mind um like i don't mind certain amounts of language like maybe watching um 

270.37 271.32 A: um 

271.54 277.20 A: robin will- yeah robin williams he has he uses some uh 

277.72 281.87 A: uh language in his comedy but it's it's within 

281.94 285.06 A: a good amount of range um 

287.24 297.32 A: like i never i never participated in the d- andrew dice clay i mean i heard some of his stuff were funny and uh 

291.77 292.98 B: yeah 

296.79 300.61 B: well he's a good example of somebody who walks the fine line i think 

300.59 309.88 B: i think i watched andrew dice clay at the time when he was popular and i think i remember thinking sometimes the things he said i thought were generally offensive 

304.46 305.35 A: yes 

309.64 310.67 A: mhm 

309.80 317.94 B: and i think sometimes the things he said were funny you know i think he walked a real fine line there i think that he 

312.84 313.89 A: yeah 

318.03 331.08 B: i found some of the things that he said offensive because i didn't think he was joking i think that he really held a lot of beliefs about women uh he was very misogynistic and and very um 

326.87 328.11 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

331.44 334.79 B: negative towards women and i think that um 

334.79 341.07 B: a lot of that was was true i don't think it was an act and i don't think it was a joke i think that he was 

339.14 340.71 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

340.98 351.35 B: maybe exaggerating it to make it a joke but i think that inside of him he's held some of those beliefs so to me those those kind of things were 

351.65 364.90 B: were n- offensive but uh you know other things that he said that were just kind of jokes or like these little nursery rhymes that he did and stuff you know they weren't offensive but they weren't necessarily funny but i didn't find i 

363.38 366.09 A: yeah nursery rhymes [laughter] 

365.10 371.26 B: mean i don't really think just someone using swear words is necessarily offensive 

371.02 371.94 A: right 

371.25 373.75 B: to me it's the id- it's the ideas 

373.57 382.36 B: behind it like the like for example andrew dice clay i think you know he held a lot of negative beliefs about women in general you know 

376.68 378.37 A: [noise] 

381.66 383.17 A: mhm 

382.22 392.60 B: and i think that's the offensive idea you know the same way if you're making jokes about you know any any group of people you're making giant generalizations about them 

392.71 404.72 B: it's one thing to make those generalizations kind of tongue in cheek sometimes you can be poking fun at the people who make kind of generalizations but other times you're making the generalization yourself 

401.42 402.33 A: mhm 

404.59 405.68 A: yeah 

404.60 413.65 B: you know so i think it's a it's a very fine line and i can't necessarily tell you exactly where the line is drawn but i usually know it when i see you know 

412.91 416.69 A: yeah yeah yeah like um 

416.73 430.07 A: richard pryor when he did his stuff he uh he would use bad language you know as as if he was having a conversation you know like um you know just 

427.92 428.80 B: uh-huh 

429.76 433.05 B: maybe just talking like how he talks in normal life i think 

432.23 436.90 A: yeah just like an exclamation he would use it as an exclamation 

435.10 435.96 B: (( oh )) 

436.48 439.87 B: yeah see i never found any of richard pryor's stuff uh 

440.11 442.07 B: offensive at all 

441.76 442.79 A: yeah 

442.16 445.00 B: you know i think he was just kind of uh 

445.23 449.73 B: sometimes people i think i think that sometimes people get offended by 

449.71 460.83 B: ideas that scare them or or ideas that they're uncomfortable with hearing about but to me that's not offensive you know if someone say i'm listening to a comedian 

459.64 461.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

460.70 471.01 B: and he's making jokes about you know a subject that i am uncomfortable with like maybe he's a gay comedian and he's talking he's talking really graphically about gay sex 

470.84 472.32 A: mhm yeah 

471.13 474.48 B: like i'm not really a hundred percent comfortable with 

474.48 486.68 B: knowing a lot of details about that so i might not like hearing that and i might kinda be like oh come on i don't need to know that but i don't think it's offensive you know i think it might be very funny to someone who 

476.76 477.75 A: yeah 

483.89 484.60 A: mhm 

486.60 494.51 B: knows more about that or isn't quite as you know maybe a little more less prudish than i am about it you know 

493.86 501.03 A: what the humor on saturday night live i know a lot of times they push the envelope a lot about stuff like that 

499.18 509.19 B: yeah i don't know i find saturday night live to be pretty lame like lately i mean in the last ten years i hardly have ever watched saturday night live just because it's not very funny 

502.74 503.82 A: yeah 

509.09 514.49 B: i'm i'm more offended by saturday night live just because the things that they 

509.09 510.15 A: i know 

514.54 527.16 B: do are such a lame attempt at humor that they're just not even funny that's more offensive to me than like you know if they swear or if they make jokes about arabic people i did see one recently where they were 

518.21 518.98 A: mhm 

526.93 530.29 B: doing kind of an imitation of an arabic person 

530.32 531.61 B: and um 

531.46 543.70 B: i didn't really think it was offensive i i think you know it might have been in bad taste but i don't think that it was necessarily offensive it was more stupid than anything else and i think anyone watching 

536.36 537.45 A: mhm 

541.36 542.35 A: mhm 

543.56 554.44 B: would just say like oh that's really stupid arabic people aren't like that more than they would you know say believe it or you know or or because i i mean i don't think that 

547.87 548.65 A: mhm 

554.54 561.87 B: i don't think that the people that wrote that bit on saturday night live or acted it actually believe that that's what arabic people are really like 

558.51 559.61 A: (( [noise] )) 

561.16 565.78 A: yeah they just wanted to make a lot of people mad [laughter] get a reaction 

565.38 571.77 B: yeah maybe that might be they might be out for getting to get publicity i think you might be right 

569.79 570.98 A: i like 

571.23 572.81 A: i like the um 

573.10 585.12 A: the the imitations of like bush and chaney and gore and clinton how they do the the politics skits political skits like [noise] 

582.26 583.33 B: uh-huh 

585.51 589.80 A: i remember when [noise] donavon chaney was [noise] 

591.49 595.35 A: i don't know i think we were attacking iraq and then 

595.42 599.95 A: um i wanted to watch one episode where um oh yeah
