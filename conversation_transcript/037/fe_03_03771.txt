110.04 119.66 B: i guess i don't know i guess i was just put off a little bit by it but it wasn't they weren't like dirty so crude it was just a little shocking to me that someone was that crude on t._v.

125.33 129.97 A: oh okay okay they they were really trying to test it out [noise] 

130.07 134.68 A: [noise] remem- how now see i'm in my sixties how old are you 

134.27 135.84 B: i'm thirty three

138.39 139.39 B: uh-huh 

139.66 140.67 B: uh-huh 

140.28 148.17 A: we used to all sit there with our mouths open at first like what in the heck did they just say we can't believe you said something like that 

145.04 146.13 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

147.77 148.84 B: and did you 

148.91 152.49 B: do you disagree with that or do you think it's good that they did those things 

151.88 153.01 A: um 

153.39 159.80 A: at the time it was difficult to accept um but now i can sit back and see the humor in it 

159.18 160.11 B: uh-huh 

159.95 165.50 A: it was very difficult because i i grew up when it was racial [noise] problems um 

165.60 169.63 A: um and like the kids today they use the word nigger 

169.62 170.58 B: uh-huh 

170.45 174.30 A: as a a sign of respect to each other 

174.48 180.47 A: acknowledging each other and to us that that's [noise] such a a disgrace 

175.88 176.80 B: right 

180.64 182.41 A: to the black race 

181.84 187.27 B: i think that's that's racism and i don't think that's necessary so you think that's dirty 

186.37 188.38 A: [noise] yes i do 

187.92 197.14 B: uh-huh i guess you know what you're right dirty i think of it as being sexy dirty but dirty is being gross and that racism is gross you're right you're right 

188.43 189.60 A: i really do 

193.12 194.81 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

195.70 201.93 A: yeah um you know we we've thrown back we're we're trying to get the kids are trying to get their own 

201.95 209.27 A: style and brand an- an- and language but i i think they're going to far because 

209.25 218.87 A: it's humiliating us as older americans um it doesn't show respect from what we've what we've gone through 

213.81 214.92 B: mhm 

218.72 223.11 B: i think richard pryor to me was really off off the limits 

224.90 227.35 B: you remember him from he was from the eighties too 

226.99 230.47 A: yeah he was no he was good 

229.80 232.32 B: you think s- see for me 'cause i'm white 

231.87 232.84 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

232.48 234.01 B: and i felt like 

234.97 241.13 B: i felt maybe because when i saw red fox already things had changed a lot you know i was seeing reruns 

240.18 241.39 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

241.23 244.40 B: and i was seeing him on his t._v. show but um 

244.65 250.60 B: but for me richard pryor seemed to be really pushing the the race limits like he was being really crude 

250.67 254.27 B: and playing down like to the lowest humor i thought 

252.73 262.29 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well he was clean [noise] i'm gonna tell you [noise] compared to what's [noise] out there now and it it wasn't bad back then because his was more of 

255.32 256.20 B: (( really )) 

262.78 270.42 A: hu- i guess i guess you actually have to be black to understand it back then it was more bringing comedy to our situation 

269.97 270.91 B: uh-huh 

270.52 277.26 A: and uplifting us somebody had to give us something to laugh at and he did and that's how i felt about him 

271.81 272.74 B: uh-huh 

274.29 275.26 B: uh-huh 

276.90 282.46 B: but you felt like you felt like red sox was more risque like like more more prude 

280.98 294.58 A: back then it was um because [noise] y- you've got a look at the times that he came out in the sixties it it was a difficult time with archie bunker [noise] at first when his fir- his show first came out 

287.29 288.38 B: yeah 

290.84 291.87 B: yeah 

294.73 308.78 A: [noise] there were bad there was a lot of bad publicity with it until everybody finally just sat down [noise] and looked at it [noise] and said hey it's comedy it it's not look- he's not point at one particular person 

298.34 299.37 B: really 

309.32 322.84 A: he he's just using a form of comedy of ignorance and that's how you have to look it 'cause that's how red fox was too more ignorant than um trying to down play a particular group or something like that 

312.64 313.32 B: right 

315.73 316.62 B: right 

322.34 324.62 B: that's an interest way to look at it 

324.09 327.52 A: yeah um and it a form of the 

324.83 325.55 B: (( huh )) 

327.56 331.24 A: entertainment and somebody had to introduce it 

331.59 333.85 A: um but now it's just 

334.34 346.93 A: it's it's not humor because back then you didn't have the vulgar language that went with it you had a few cuss words i mean they were scared to put those cuss words out there the stuff they say today [sigh] 

339.41 340.27 B: uh-huh 

348.35 351.07 B: it it's funny because like i guess 

351.12 354.20 B: there's there's this guy uh bill moyer 

354.05 355.57 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

354.99 363.77 B: obviously you've seen him on t._v. right so he does this thing called uh he did one on mythology and he was just talking i think about like the length 

356.19 357.05 A: yes 

360.59 361.46 A: uh-huh 

364.08 365.16 B: he said like 

365.56 372.88 B: a little boy used to wear short pants you know like his daddy wore slacks and he wore pants but then when you 

368.38 369.29 A: uh-huh 

370.51 372.45 A: right [noise] right 

373.12 375.11 B: once you move the um 

375.42 380.89 B: i'm gonna ask you to hold on one second 'cause i'm job hunting and my other phone is ringing i know this is bad 

379.83 383.34 A: okay just don't just don't click me off 'cause then you lose your money 

381.23 382.09 B: i won't 

385.47 386.42 B: speaking 

389.59 391.17 B: good how are you max 

394.53 402.00 B: not a problem but can i call you back in about five four minutes i need to finish one other call i'll call you right back uh what's your extension 

403.01 404.51 B: (( call you back in a bit )) 

405.10 405.93 B: (( bye bye )) 

406.55 408.32 B: i'm so sorry evelyn [noise] 

407.75 410.80 A: oh that's no no no no didn't want you to lose your money 

410.19 418.85 B: exactly [laughter] and the job hunting thing is more money so um what oh so he was just talking about the length of pants and once he like 

410.84 412.78 A: [laughter] 

414.30 415.12 A: (( yeah )) 

417.92 418.83 A: mhm 

418.80 425.23 B: once a little boy starts wearing pants even though it's very cute then all of a sudden you change his personality with the concept 

424.24 425.01 A: yes 

425.06 425.87 A: (( yeah )) 

425.08 436.84 B: and the and the same thing with like the the length of a skirt you know when you show a little bit of heel in society and you think that's what's sexy and risque and well that's just it and now when you pull up your skirt to above your knee 

428.03 429.04 A: mhm 

430.39 431.23 A: right 

436.86 440.10 B: you have to keep pulling it up further to get more risque 

439.57 441.74 A: yes yes [noise] 

440.31 444.68 B: and i think it's the same way with the humor 'cause once somebody you know said something 

444.79 450.43 B: that was inappropriate in the sixties well it's already been done so you need to push the envelope further 

448.46 449.30 A: right 

450.09 453.95 A: right and and isn't that right but i just don't get it [noise] 

454.32 458.88 A: i can't get it [noise] i'm too old i don't even watch comedy anymore 

458.63 459.47 B: no 

460.02 461.95 A: i'm more life time 

461.59 464.33 B: ah okay okay i understand i i 

462.92 463.49 A: (( [noise] )) 

463.54 464.36 A: mhm 

464.56 468.91 B: get that you have obviously you're you're there with a baby you have uh 

468.79 470.03 A: (( [noise] my grand- )) 

469.05 470.94 B: kids in their twenties or thirties 

470.81 473.82 A: yes i've got my first grandchild here with me 

471.29 472.19 B: uh-huh 

473.24 475.20 B: oh you're so lucky 

474.56 477.95 A: yeah oh i'm blessed the child is a dream 

476.06 476.81 B: (( mm )) 

478.31 481.21 A: my husband and i are both retired and we're just sitting here 

481.45 483.65 A: enjoying every moment of it 

483.13 484.97 B: you're so lucky i 

484.24 487.71 A: we picked her up on sunday and we're taking her to the cayman islands 

487.54 489.07 B: oh my goodness 

488.74 494.49 A: yes [laughter] we feel so blessed to be able to to take her travelling and 

494.77 498.12 A: and do things with her 'cause we grew up in the sixties 

496.09 496.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

498.23 500.24 A: i grew up in south 

500.08 501.48 B: where in the south 

501.10 502.54 A: savannah georgia 

502.08 503.61 B: oh my goodness 

503.02 509.21 A: and i mean there was racism then we were the first group of children to go to 

509.29 510.27 A: um 

510.60 513.94 A: integrated schools it was rough it was very difficult 

514.08 515.99 A: that was hard to accept 

516.00 517.03 A: and then 

517.65 520.19 A: going into a military background 

520.56 523.41 A: i think that was the biggest thing to save my life 

523.35 525.58 B: you personally or your husband 

523.47 524.32 A: because 

524.98 526.00 A: both of us 

525.75 527.05 B: really 

526.74 532.63 A: that was the biggest thing that saved our lives because we were introduced to other cultures and other people 

532.89 535.43 A: um because when my parents grew up 

535.53 537.04 A: and um 

537.33 542.60 A: they considered themselves negroes or colored and i can't stand those words 

539.18 540.06 B: right 

542.37 543.34 B: right 

543.46 546.24 A: [noise] that's not who i am i'm an american 

546.41 547.56 B: right 

546.97 549.17 A: that's all i am and an american 

549.32 556.36 A: i i support any and everything america does those troops over there i wish i could put the uniform on right now and go help 

556.25 560.70 B: but you clearly i mean you brought up pretty immediately that you're a black woman 

560.41 562.17 A: yeah [laughter] 

561.03 565.32 B: so i mean that that is you- you're an american but you're clearly are identified 

565.47 577.28 A: as a black woman [laughter] but i i tell ya i i love this country so much and i think we're going a little bit too far with the things we put on television and say to each other that we're gonna 

566.43 567.44 B: yeah 

574.25 575.30 B: mhm 

577.24 586.18 A: go overboard and lose that identity [noise] we fought so hard to get [noise] that's what i'm afraid is happening [noise] so to me all of this [noise] um 

581.10 582.30 B: mhm 

586.45 594.69 A: all of these jokes and these television shows have have gone way overboard they really have much too far overboard for me 

594.26 599.89 B: i had a very interesting conversation the other day with two actually it was three young girls
