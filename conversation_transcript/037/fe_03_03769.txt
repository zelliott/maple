12.82 18.07 A: [laughter] oh that's all right i wasn't yeah um 

13.08 16.69 B: sorry about that i'm just kind of out of it today [laughter] 

18.22 24.25 A: let me see the the topic today is acceptable humor or humor in poor taste 

24.21 25.44 B: right 

24.83 26.84 A: okay what do you think 

27.19 28.16 B: well 

28.25 34.27 B: i don't know i tend to not be offended very easily so i pretty much like everything 

34.26 44.64 B: [laughter] like i mean i i know people consider south park to be in poor taste for the most but i i do like things like that although i do think there are lines that can't be crossed 

34.30 35.42 A: okay 

45.04 47.18 A: okay i'm i'm pretty 

47.26 49.72 A: much the opposite of you 

49.29 50.65 B: (( oh okay )) 

50.15 57.97 A: [laughter] i we- i'm fifty eight years old you don't have to tell me but you sound a lot younger [laughter] um 

55.31 56.17 B: oh 

57.50 59.11 B: no i'm thirty four 

58.53 69.24 A: okay yeah i have four grown children and i have six grandchildren so maybe that's what's gonna influence my idea about humor 

69.25 79.41 A: you know being in poor taste because a lot of the times there's all seventeen of us when we get together and and it does feel there's a line between 

69.42 70.23 B: mm 

70.78 71.81 B: right 

79.49 81.70 A: somebody telling a joke that 

81.87 84.55 A: you know might be heard by a thirteen year old 

85.45 86.52 A: (( or )) 

86.55 91.86 A: you know a mo- uh one of the girls that had just lost a baby or you know things like that that's [noise] 

89.82 90.65 B: oh 

90.62 95.30 B: yeah well there are i mean there are definitely that's the other thing too as far as 

95.07 109.05 B: poor taste is concerned like i like south park but my step brother lets his kids watch it and they're really young and i i definitely think i'm like uh that's just not appropriate for someone that young there are there are definitely times 

106.73 110.71 A: now i have no idea what south park is what what's south park 

109.74 118.98 B: it's a cartoon um it's very risque to put it mildly i love it i think it's hysterical but i certainly wouldn't wanna see a little kid watching it 

111.17 112.30 A: (( oh okay )) 

118.72 119.76 A: oh 

119.01 129.55 B: i mean i think there's definitely should be age restric- and it is it's a it it's definitely formatted for adults they say right in the very beginning that it could be considered offensive 

129.67 130.43 A: (( yeah mm )) 

130.42 140.62 B: and then they're right i mean and they're pretty much equal opportunity offenders too there's there's definitely like i mean if if i [noise] had children there's definitely things i would shield them from 

135.16 136.10 A: yeah 

140.97 146.23 A: oh i i i think you would you know if if they were gonna fall on ears that 

145.76 151.55 B: can can you do me a favor my phone keeps ringing can you hang on one second sorry about this hold on 

147.03 147.83 A: sure 

149.38 150.33 A: sure 

151.07 152.15 A: that's okay 

163.42 164.99 B: sorry about that 

164.20 167.37 A: that's okay did you see that movie jackass 

167.69 171.26 B: no i don't want to either that's something i find just disgusting 

170.86 172.32 A: me too oh 

171.57 179.18 B: i find that disgusting and i just think it it's kinda like some of these other reality shows these things where i'm like you know this 

178.03 180.12 A: the fear factor and 

179.52 188.94 B: definitely the when i watch these things i'm thinking if a child really is easily influenced these people should get sued to the point of bankruptcy 

180.40 181.24 A: (( ugh )) 

185.17 186.32 A: mhm 

188.74 189.79 A: yeah i 

188.98 192.98 B: for what they're doing i i find that type of thing reprehensible 

192.99 195.84 B: i i don't like those types of things at all 

195.41 199.33 A: i don't either and how about like when you're watching something like um 

199.54 206.54 A: uh funniest home videos you know when the men fall on the fences and their crotch is hurt 

204.84 214.45 B: yeah that is pretty i actually watched one of those recently with my husband and something happened i don't remember what it was and i remember him saying that's not funny she could have gotten hurt 

207.39 208.18 A: (( yes )) 

213.88 223.90 A: yeah you know that's that's kinda like drawing over the line to me i think that's in poor taste too and forty million people are laughing at some bor- poor guy getting hit 

217.02 218.34 B: (( definitely )) 

223.98 232.78 A: you know or or sleight riding down a hill and smashing into a tree and everybody's laughing their heads off that's poor taste humor 

231.75 243.53 B: yeah i do agree i guess i need to retrace what i said 'cause when i say i don't get offended very easily i wasn't even thinking a long the lines of t._v. but yeah things like that do really bother me those don't sit well with me at all 

238.81 239.45 A: (( [laughter] )) 

242.72 244.27 A: (( [mn] [mn] no )) 

243.86 254.50 B: that's well it's like wrestling too wrestling just gotten absolutely disgusting it's gotten so offensive on so many levels i can't believe that they're allowed to get away with some of the thing they do 

246.53 247.38 A: oh 

254.18 268.11 A: that's true and one of my i think it's my ten year grandson that's involved in wrestling and my daughter's you know she's she's not allowing him to watch it on television because even though he's in the sport at grammar school it's offensive 

263.67 264.93 B: i don't blame her 

267.51 270.26 B: it is offensive it's very offensive 

268.58 269.66 A: yeah 

269.87 276.28 A: yeah no i i agree with you something else i was gonna ask you about too not the fear factor 

276.49 281.83 A: well that jackass movie thing that has all these kids imitating 

282.04 290.64 A: you know running out in front of a train and running out in front of a car and trying to bicycle over a ramp over a car 

290.03 291.61 B: yeah yeah 

290.66 292.90 A: that that's pretty scary too 

291.94 301.53 B: it's it's it is it is really scary and it just it it's other shows though that aren't even comedy though these other reality shows that they do like joe millionaire 

294.40 295.44 A: so what 

301.48 309.34 B: and mr personality i'm like that just kinda makes us look like a really stupid country that these things get the reviews that they do too at 

301.64 302.49 A: [laughter] 

309.05 311.64 A: okay let's talk about that 

309.36 310.53 B: (( least if they )) 

311.57 312.41 B: okay 

312.34 317.53 A: the um the one that you just mentioned mr mrs personality 

316.20 318.32 B: mr mr personality 

317.95 322.40 A: mr personality how do you feel about monica lewinsky 

322.49 326.62 A: becoming a celebrity after having an affair with our president 

326.04 334.91 B: i saw that and i can't remember what the show was that she does too it's really pretty disgusting too it's not mr personality though is it actually it could be 

333.59 337.55 A: i think it is i think she's the host- the actual hostess 

336.95 341.92 B: yeah i actually find it kinda disgusting i find it kinda disgusting 

339.78 340.82 A: you do 

341.69 346.67 A: yeah me too i i i tot- i emailed that show 

346.71 357.19 A: last week and i told them that i was gonna watch it one time which i haven't yet but i'm gonna watch it one time i'm going to write down every sponsor that they have and i'm gonna boycott that sponsor 

357.30 362.00 A: because i i just can't believe that somebody could become a personality 

357.47 358.75 B: (( i don't blame you )) 

362.46 365.57 A: you know that our children or whatever would look up to 

365.12 365.97 B: yep 

366.01 368.84 A: that and that's the only way she became famous 

368.27 380.55 B: that's the thing it's i just think it's disgusting 'cause i'm like you know the only reason she's famous is because she had an affair with clinton now what kind of example does that set for people it doesn't set an example at all in my opinion 

374.71 375.88 A: yeah 

380.16 387.53 A: no make out with the president in the ovi- oval office and then three years from now you can have your own t._v. show 

381.25 383.02 B: not a good one anyway 

384.75 385.60 B: right 

386.81 391.91 B: commit adultery with the president and you'll be famous that's pretty much exactly what they're saying 

389.02 390.24 A: [laughter] 

391.69 392.88 A: i know 

392.42 393.27 B: yeah 

392.93 395.44 A: well they didn't email me back so 

395.45 396.45 A: but so wait 

396.07 407.05 B: they probably won't either i did find a really good website that you might want to check out for things like this there is a website it's www dot jump the shark dot com 

406.09 409.76 A: (( a minute www jump )) 

409.48 411.75 B: jump the shark all one word 

411.74 414.40 A: s. h. a. r. k. 

413.81 414.62 B: yep 

414.49 415.69 A: dot com 

415.23 417.64 B: the reason it's called that is because it's 

417.43 417.99 A: (( [noise] )) 

417.46 430.38 B: it's basically it's about shows that have pretty much reached their peak and the reason it's called jump the shark is because supposedly happy days got really bad after the episode where fonz jumped over a shark 

422.50 423.60 A: yeah 

430.30 432.13 A: (( ooh [mn] )) 

430.86 436.70 B: and if you go to that website they have tons and tons of shows you can vote on and people put comments on it 

436.72 451.43 B: and i've i've gone in there a lot when shows have offended when i've found shows to be offensive i've gone in there and voted and said why although take my advice don't read all of the comments though some of the comments are infuriating especially if you got in to check out a show you like 

447.02 448.20 A: [laughter] 

451.20 452.70 A: (( ooh wow )) 

452.12 456.44 B: but that might be a good one for you to go into and put some feedback in on it 

457.09 463.16 A: not that this has anything to do with the topic of the conversation but did you see frasier last week 

459.60 460.85 B: no i know [laughter] 

463.08 466.05 B: was that the one with david ogden stiers 

465.84 470.90 A: i think they said wh- they were gonna find out who frasier and his brother's real daddy was 

469.91 471.82 B: yep i did see that one 

471.24 472.65 A: (( who was it )) 

472.03 481.33 B: it was it actually turned out to be who they thought it was they thought it was gonna be i can't remember what his character was i watched it because david ogden stiers was in and i love him if 

480.44 483.72 A: it was the dad they think is their dad or the other guy 

482.86 485.16 B: it was the dad they think is their dad 

484.11 486.24 A: oh thank god [noise] 

485.95 492.48 B: i just saw it because i said oh if it's someone from m._a._s._h. i'll watch it i love david og- david ogden stiers anyway 

491.92 493.48 A: yeah yeah 

492.35 500.97 B: and i'm pretty much a fan of just about anyone who's had anything to do with the series m._a._s._h. and i i i love david ogden stiers and that's who 

497.16 498.79 A: oh me too 

500.87 512.04 B: i don't think the boys thought he was their father i think their dad did 'cause they were just so like him but no it turned out that who they thought was their dad was their dad 

505.84 506.87 A: oh 

508.14 509.32 A: yeah 

511.81 517.33 A: well they really did get that david ogden stiers to really [laughter] he was the right person for that part [laughter] 

516.43 520.31 B: oh he was he was perfect it was really really well done 

519.76 527.90 A: we were out in our r._v. and i couldn't get the t._v. to come in that night i was so upset but i said now this is really gonna be tick me off 

524.23 525.25 B: oh 

527.47 533.21 B: i'm sure i'm sure they'll show it again i'm sure they'll show it again probably during the summer when they run repeats 

532.62 533.90 A: yeah 

533.26 538.32 B: or it'll eventually one of the other things i like now is everything's coming out on d._v._d. now 

538.32 539.49 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

538.83 546.23 B: so i i've had it with commercials and everything so i just generally and we have lousy cable system so generally i'll 

546.00 555.91 B: if i a show comes out on d._v._d. that i really like i'll get it like we have m._a._s._h. one to three on disc right now and it's great it's unedited and there's no laugh tracks 

551.03 552.32 A: wow 

553.04 553.87 A: (( cool )) 

556.05 557.12 A: yeah 

556.26 565.52 B: well actually you can chose whether you want a laugh track or not but we we opt to not have it 'cause i kinda feel like we know when we're supposed to laugh and when we're not 

563.50 564.83 A: (( yeah )) 

564.96 569.23 A: [laughter] well that's a cool thing to have a choice on though 

565.73 567.32 B: so but yeah things like 

568.62 579.46 B: yeah it really is it really is you can either have the canned laughter on or off and they're releasing see they're releasing them really slowly although this year they're supposed to release two seasons in one year and 

569.86 570.88 A: (( [laughter] mm )) 

579.32 585.14 B: i'm like there were eleven seasons we're not even gonna be able to walk by the time they release the entire series 

584.61 586.07 A: [laughter] 

585.22 592.38 B: so i'm hoping they said they're releasing season four in july and if they do that's gonna make it twice a year that they're doing it 

592.46 593.47 A: wow 

593.08 599.95 B: we only have the three seasons right now [laughter] and i'm like i want to get it when b. j. honeycutt comes in i think i think that's the next season 

598.42 599.29 A: [laughter]
