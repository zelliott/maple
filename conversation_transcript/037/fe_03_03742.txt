78.13 80.89 B: uh it's not a living wage that's for sure 

80.46 87.55 A: well no no and and i know people should try to get some sort of skill you know even if you're not college bound you should try to 

85.71 86.94 B: yeah

94.08 94.99 B: (( yeah )) 

94.99 96.35 A: model and i 

96.69 100.74 A: so i making minimum wage doesn't really apply but you know 

100.86 101.83 A: somebody who's 

100.90 102.14 B: yeah 

102.59 107.09 A: they oughta at least be able to make commission on top of it depending on you know on what they do 

106.74 109.10 B: exactly just like serving 

109.76 121.14 B: um yeah i know people though who have had minimum wage jobs but then they work like two or three you know because they're not skilled workers and so they have to work like eighty or a hundred hours a week 

121.20 122.05 A: right 

121.23 122.80 B: just to make ends me 

123.40 125.42 B: so i mean that's not 

123.72 128.17 A: no i've never even when i was in in high school i worked 

128.67 130.77 A: in sales in high school 

130.66 132.17 B: yeah 

130.81 133.59 A: so i made commission on top of my mm mm 

132.59 136.16 B: my uh my my first job was not minimum wage either 

137.03 140.64 A: and even waitressing still isn't really minimum wage you get tips 

137.13 138.11 B: so 

139.42 147.27 B: no it's it's not it's not really minimum wage i mean the company pays you minimum wage but they know that you're getting tips and that's part of your salary 

146.90 148.04 A: yeah 

147.84 148.76 B: so 

149.84 151.54 A: we're um we're in 

150.25 154.34 B: i mean you get taxed uh on your tips as well so part of your income 

152.62 154.26 A: what city are you in 

154.46 155.96 B: i'm in los angeles 

155.65 156.97 A: oh okay me too 

156.80 171.49 A: okay yeah i mean i i grew up in chicago and then i moved here so maybe maybe if we li- if i lived like in a tiny town like in kentucky maybe [laughter] maybe that would be okay but i think nationwide it should be higher than that 

157.18 158.49 B: oh right on 

165.73 166.40 B: [mn] 

166.57 167.68 B: [laughter] 

171.50 174.62 B: oh yeah um i know i grew up in california too 

174.84 178.57 B: uh in calif- i grew up in california as well as living here now 

178.58 189.10 B: [sigh] that's what i meant to say and it's always been expensive to live here i used to live in san jose which is northern california and that's more expensive than los angeles but still 

187.69 188.74 A: oh yeah it 

189.36 194.57 B: i know that minimum wage is not cutting for anybody who lives in california [mn] 

193.57 199.53 A: wouldn't cut it for any yeah i was gonna say it wouldn't cut it for people in california maybe if you lived like in reno 

200.04 201.62 B: yeah 

200.53 202.58 A: otta or um 

201.93 204.23 B: where the cost of living is really low 

203.73 206.79 A: right they in fact they should adjust 

208.25 210.70 A: they should adjust it based on 

211.03 213.26 A: your your area 

213.45 222.18 B: well yeah i think they have a federal minimum wage which is l- i guess that's five fifteen and then it varies state to state according to 

214.44 215.02 A: (( mhm )) 

222.40 228.00 B: 'cause i know 'cause the cost of living in california is higher that's why it's six seventy five it's almost seven dollars 

227.61 230.38 A: oh okay no i had no idea 

228.58 230.01 B: but but 

230.54 240.40 B: yeah yes i'm experienced with minimum wage but yeah i mean even though [mn] my company pays me minimum wage i still make a a lot more than that 

239.91 241.45 A: right right 

240.76 243.32 B: yeah because it's on top of that 

243.11 244.38 A: right 

244.41 253.58 A: yeah that's that's the part that is odd to me uh but then i you know what i don't i don't really know 'cause if you're totally unskilled and you haven't even bothered to learn 

253.83 258.12 A: anything and i mean waitressing is a skill you know 

254.06 255.13 B: mhm 

257.17 259.82 B: yes [laughter] 

258.36 261.04 A: it is i mean i wouldn't have the patience to do it 

260.95 261.92 B: (( it is yeah )) 

261.05 267.80 A: so it's like if you have el- i mean like minimum wage i guess might apply to people working for mcdonald's or something i'm 

268.05 274.91 A: not entirely sure 'cause it's like if you raise the minimum wage and an employer can't have afford to hire as many people 

268.31 269.48 B: (( yeah )) 

274.95 276.01 B: yeah 

275.41 279.85 A: then would i rather be making minimum wage or would i rather be making nothing 

279.96 281.57 B: yeah exactly 

280.06 293.54 A: you know is is part of it uh i think that they should base more things on like a commission or tips or some- you know they they should have your e- your productivity should be a part of how much you get paid 

287.80 288.85 B: yeah 

293.71 308.65 B: yeah instead of just a blanket wage depending on how hard you work well i know people that work who have worked minimum wage jobs and just worked their butts off just because they have a strong work ethic and then they you know they get promoted and they do something else they started out at minimum wage but 

302.29 303.24 A: (( [noise] right )) 

308.80 313.88 B: it's not something as an adult you can make a living off of you have to you have to move on 

312.04 313.29 A: no but as 

313.35 317.40 A: but as an adult hopefully you will have some sort of skill 

313.97 314.59 B: (( [mn] )) 

315.53 316.64 B: yeah 

317.55 320.90 A: 'cause the minimum wage to me applies to jobs that kids have 

320.76 322.64 B: yeah exactly 

321.27 324.75 A: you know like like teenagers or or college students maybe 

323.29 327.41 B: teenagers or y- or you're just starting out or you know 

327.50 336.51 A: well if you're just starting out and you just got finished uh i- if you just finished college and you're just starting out you need to be making [laughter] more than minimum wage your kill you 

327.83 329.29 B: you're just 

334.83 336.70 B: yeah well definitely uh 

337.04 344.33 B: but i'm talking about like um people who maybe just moved to this country who don't you know and don't have the skill haven't adapted to to 

343.95 345.07 A: oh i see 

344.75 348.58 B: what america's like if you just moved here from mexico you're like you know 

346.36 352.22 A: although you know what i don't know most people who move to this country are like 

351.50 352.59 B: yeah 

352.43 360.11 A: i don't think they have to worry about it because the ones that are illegal do you know day labor or stuff which is cash 

360.25 361.41 B: yeah 

360.30 364.65 A: and the ones who are legal can work in their communities 

364.62 365.72 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

364.76 367.81 A: i mean i knew a guy who was um 

367.96 369.87 A: from sri lanka 

370.22 372.63 A: and he in his own country he's like 

372.70 380.51 A: um an attorney or something but here's he's a chauffeur but at least he makes you know he makes 

374.52 377.52 B: oh yeah i've i've known plenty of people like that too 

378.34 379.43 B: yeah 

380.64 387.56 A: (( i don't know i i don't know i'm you know what i actually i take that back i'm not entirely sure who the minimum wage applies to [noise] [mn] )) 

385.33 386.19 B: [laughter] 

388.54 392.25 B: um you know it just sounds like teenage jobs 

392.47 397.51 B: ooh well or if you just don't have the skill sets to make more than that 

397.88 401.70 B: you know if you if you have to work at mcdonald's and that's the only job you can hold 

397.92 398.88 A: yeah 

402.25 416.93 A: yeah i mean i would think that they could do something better like suppose you were um mentally deficient you know then then those people are the ones who really would benefit from a higher minimum wage 'cause anybody else anybody who's sharp enough oughta be able to earn more 

407.96 410.02 B: yeah yeah 

417.05 424.07 B: yeah exactly but you would you would hope that somebody working a minimum wage job like that who has to work at mcdonald's would also have other people 

418.07 418.84 A: (( so )) 

424.22 431.37 B: you know family that maybe they had better skills and were making more money so they were contributing with the minimum wage 

428.91 429.80 A: well 

429.92 436.12 A: they i don't know i really don't i i i've never even really thought about it i mean i i live in a 

436.29 437.91 A: i live alone but 

438.47 439.44 A: (( i )) 

440.70 445.70 A: (( yeah it's been so [laughter] god i feel so old it's been so long [laughter] since i've made minimum wage )) 

442.08 443.03 B: [laughter] 

446.89 452.85 A: [laughter] i just can't think i can't think of a situation where it's appropriate for an adult 

453.06 460.92 A: but it's it's it's bound to be i guess i mean it should they should raise it a little bit just because you think about senior citizens who can't make enough money 

453.28 454.29 B: yeah 

461.22 466.36 A: with their retirement and they have to go back to work at walmart i mean those people should make more 

462.57 463.47 B: yeah 

466.32 473.54 B: well i know i know that walmart pays more than minimum wage but uh but that's you know you were just saying an example 

472.69 484.35 A: but you know i'm just i'm u- i'm using that as an example like if you if you thought that you could retire and you really can't and you know you've spent your whole life as a postal worker or something then you really don't have any skills 

475.15 476.47 B: yeah 

482.45 483.81 B: yeah 

484.40 485.80 A: (( [noise] um )) 

484.65 486.80 B: [lipsmack] but the thing is um 

487.03 489.28 B: you know if you raise the minimum wage 

489.39 495.80 B: then every okay so everybody's making more money but then everything will get more expensive because yeah so it just 

493.61 497.15 A: everything i know it it it's really not exactly 

497.10 498.17 B: yeah 

497.62 501.84 A: the r- the right i'm not sure what is the right thing to do but um i 

502.30 510.30 B: yeah not being an economist and knowing that from all the ecom classes i had to take knowing that it's an extremely complicated process 

506.98 508.21 A: [laughter] 

510.45 511.35 A: right 

510.89 515.66 B: uh i'm l- i can't even guess at what what the right thing to do is 

515.50 524.84 A: yeah i i think that it would have to be based personally on supply and demand for the area you know 'cause i'm sure like you said los angeles was higher 

521.38 522.35 B: yeah 

524.95 526.09 A: um 

524.98 526.16 B: yeah 

526.74 536.75 A: and then i i i don't know i mean uh i'm a democrat and a very liberal person which you'd have to be i think living in l._a. but um 

530.03 530.99 B: [laughter] 

531.37 532.62 B: yes me too 

534.66 539.01 B: yeah [laughter] it just kinda comes with the territory 

536.98 538.38 A: and i'm very 

539.13 540.95 A: i'm very big on 

541.33 542.38 A: um 

542.44 544.75 A: social programs but 

544.11 545.06 B: mhm 

545.01 554.56 A: i'm also big on that you know you you teach you give a man fish and he eats for a day you teach him to fish and he fish his whole or he'll h- eat it his whole life 

553.56 558.70 B: eat for a lifetime yeah and big on personal responsibility yeah 

555.02 557.01 A: and i've never i 

557.78 567.09 A: am very big on personal responsibility i think that social programs should should be for people like i'm a diabetic and i'm you know in in in the entertainment industry but 

567.30 570.58 A: i'm not part of a union so i don't have health insurance 

570.50 571.58 B: yeah 

571.09 573.25 A: and not having health insurance 

573.46 574.57 A: isn't cool 

574.75 579.42 A: so that's what i i i can't stand about you know the people that 

575.03 575.81 B: no 

580.11 589.79 A: uh that are on the other on the other playing field in the politics i- is that they don't care about people who you know i contribute i pay taxes 

589.69 594.55 B: exactly i give so much of my money to the government and get no programs out of it 

590.40 591.93 A: and i think um 

593.90 599.83 A: well no programs and then like my cousin lives in england and her boyfriend is a musician
