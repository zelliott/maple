0.62 1.71 A: hello 

1.36 3.17 B: hi my name's jimmy 

2.83 4.38 A: (( hey jim i'm bob how're you doing )) 

4.12 5.65 B: oh pretty good what's going on 

5.66 8.73 A: it's an interesting topic they freaking want us to talk about 

8.10 9.44 B: [laughter] i know 

9.67 11.19 A: acceptable [mn] 

10.04 11.09 B: bad 

11.48 21.10 A: i don't know i did i actually don't find anything that unacceptable except if the only thing that would cross the line for me is if you're making fun of something that just happened that was a major tragedy 

21.29 23.78 B: well i think it's all about context 

23.61 24.25 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

23.91 26.51 B: where you are and how well you know people 

27.08 36.46 B: like what could be acceptable to like with you and your friends isn't exactly how you're gonna talk or walk you know it all i mean it's all about where you are and what your situation and all 

36.05 41.76 A: well that's true too i mean you're not gonna make fun of your friend after he just lost a baby or something like that you know but uh 

39.75 40.88 B: right 

42.31 47.14 A: you know i'm if you take a look at like t._v. or just any kind of um um 

47.44 51.26 A: any comic that might be up there doing some kid of routine or something like that 

51.27 61.79 A: you know i can tolerate ninety nine percent of what people do but the only times that comes to me where it becomes unacceptable or inappropriate when they're sitting there making fun of an event that just happened 

61.19 68.53 B: exactly yeah there should be time but then again it's like how do you decide uh 'cause there's been enough time between the event happening and 

68.87 69.82 B: you know 

70.12 72.39 A: (( [noise] [noise] that's uh that's i guess )) 

72.46 76.53 A: that's a personal choice for most people i mean um 

75.12 76.09 B: right 

77.17 84.99 A: you know again like the talk about the war for example that we just came out of i mean you know you gonna be making fun of the war while it's going on no you're not 

84.90 86.10 B: (( that's true )) 

85.14 89.04 A: but then again when when can you make a couple of quick jokes about it 

88.58 89.64 B: right 

89.49 91.53 A: i guess it just doesn't really matter 

90.86 94.04 B: it's all a juggling call it's hard to tell you know 

94.72 95.76 B: what 

95.82 100.18 B: but i guess um the main thing is just knowing your audience don't 

100.67 107.19 B: you know they should be i guess society has loosened a lot there should be like a certain level of just like decency at first like b- 

108.09 111.28 B: when you know p- when you first meet people before 

111.57 118.61 A: well and that's the other thing too i mean when you meet somebody for the first time you don't start making fun of [laughter] something that might be a personal thing to the person 

117.87 123.37 B: exactly because you don't know their limits or how they're r- you know how they'll react to certain situations 

122.87 136.23 A: you don't even know them period i mean i i can imagine like for example um you know i just met you and i don't you from a hole in the ground but then i start making fun of like i heard something about you let's for example like you know you pee your you pee the bed at night [laughter] 

136.05 137.59 B: right and it's like 

136.58 142.78 A: hey it's like i walk up and say hey how're you doing pee the bed [laughter] first time i met you a little in- inappropriate 

140.85 154.35 B: right that's even if it's something that would not bother me if it was someone i've known for a while it's just exactly inappropriate it's not exactly the fact that the comment is actually bad it's just the fact that it's not appropriate for that situation 

154.08 160.00 A: right and and you know again it comes down to you know who you are and who your people are you know 

159.94 160.85 B: right 

160.09 163.70 A: even if you're doing it and you're meeting somebody and you're in a middle of a group of friends 

164.18 173.01 A: is it appropriate for them to bring personal issues up in in a group even though that you let's say you and i have known each other for years we bust each other about everything 

172.91 184.61 A: but would it appropriate for you to sit there and turn around and make fun of something that you knew about me that was a personal issue to me but you know how we always rag on each other in person in in private but then you do it in public 

181.12 182.10 B: right 

184.91 193.82 B: yeah that's my idea it's just because you know we've known each other for years i haven't known everybody in that group and i don't have that same level of familiarity with you know everyone 

193.56 194.59 A: precisely 

193.88 195.11 B: in the group 

195.54 209.90 A: so i mean i guess you know like you said again it comes down to um you know [noise] the topic it comes down and how familiar you are with people in the group and i guess more importantly you've got to have a little decency a little common sense when you deal with people 

209.53 212.64 B: the bottom line common sense you have common sense you be fine 

212.30 215.95 A: i mean i think ninety percent of the people in this world lack some of that sometimes 

216.23 221.21 B: a lot of times like how do people evolve to be so stupid like you know you're 

216.36 216.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

219.49 227.28 A: [noise] [noise] [laughter] i just had this conversation with somebody not too long ago like how do people [noise] how do people learn how to 

227.49 230.13 A: as we get older we learn we get more stupid [laughter] 

229.80 235.39 B: right i i'm it actually offends me like i mean how could people i don't know i don't get it you know 

235.05 236.74 A: (( [laughter] they're )) 

235.98 244.30 B: it's like even people it's like i mean individually people are pretty smart or okay but just like collectively it just wow 

244.18 247.47 A: just you know collectively people are dumb we do dumb things 

246.89 251.67 B: yeah and it also seems to be like the more intelligent people are 

251.84 256.90 B: like work wise academic wise the more stupid they were like real life which is also like weird 

256.78 263.66 A: it's quite i i always use the phrase [noise] the smarter you get the less the less common sense you'll you have so yeah 

262.09 265.33 B: exactly there has to be some kind of trade off [laughter] 

264.49 276.78 A: as the smart cells go in the common sense cells go right back out the door [laughter] i mean it comes down like anything i don't care it could be humor it could be anything it just comes down to using common sense do you 

266.66 268.43 B: [laughter] 

269.80 270.41 B: (( [laughter] )) 

274.48 276.31 B: (( right right )) 

276.83 282.97 A: do you make a a a a comment about a sensitive subject in the in the middle of a group or you know insensitive 

283.19 287.17 A: who's that comedian or no who's that that sports caster the other day 

287.66 294.92 A: it wasn't humor but he was trying to be funny when jason kidd the basketball player for the new york uh the new jersey nets 

287.75 288.57 B: who 

290.51 291.68 B: what was it 

294.80 295.73 B: right 

294.97 301.03 A: his wife was always in the front audience and and he made a comment because he jason kidd was accused of [noise] 

301.30 302.89 A: beating his wife 

302.71 303.66 B: right 

303.00 313.86 A: now she brings she she's you know he's accusing her of getting a lot of air time on t._v. by bringing her child to the front court so that the camera will be on the child then she would get camera time by having the kid there 

314.12 317.99 A: well he made a comment like if she doesn't watch it i'm gonna slap her in the face 

318.83 323.26 A: and he said it in a public forum knowing better 

318.93 319.88 B: wow 

323.33 327.79 B: right that's just especially not on t._v. that's way over the line 

324.74 326.06 A: that's crossing 

327.26 336.05 A: right that that's crossing the line that to me would be crossing the line you made an inappropriate comment even though you didn't even though you had a bit of humor in it and you were trying to be 

336.29 340.86 A: funny yet insensitive to the situation it's totally inappropriate they 

339.48 344.43 B: right but something yeah it's just especially not like i have this whole 

344.64 354.85 B: fantasy that all basketball games should be on that they should be on h._b._o. everybody should be miked and we don't need commentators and like i think the ratings would go through the roof [laughter] 

353.41 355.69 A: should do with with football too 

355.50 357.36 B: yeah just sports period 

357.46 369.57 B: have everybody miked up on h._b._o. no censors nothing that would be great let's do it if you were like greg ortega you can't make comments like that it's just not especially in a family situation because you know i mean no one's perfect 

369.28 372.85 A: right i would love to see that that would be a great thing to do for football 

371.98 375.11 B: football it would be off the hook [laughter] 

373.71 385.82 A: can you imagine sitting there like you know you know like lawrence taylor back in his day lining up against uh somebody on the offensive line and l._t. just blasting the guy with every four letter word he could think of i'm gonna get your mama and [laughter] 

383.72 386.82 B: yeah [laughter] 

386.38 392.32 A: that would be like 'cause those guys are just doing it in the heat of the moment and it'd be i'd be i'd be rolling i'm like 

389.83 390.68 B: yeah 

391.56 393.16 B: it would be great 

392.72 393.39 A: (( get in )) 

393.57 400.46 B: 'cause after watching games i'd be trying to like lip read like what is he saying you know like 'cause you know they're going off you just can't like hear it 

397.32 398.17 A: (( there i )) 

400.64 405.37 A: like when the oh hockey would even be the best because usually these guys lipping each other constantly 

404.78 406.04 B: yeah 

405.83 412.57 A: you know somebody coming down giving somebody a check on the board and they turn around and and you see their mouths going a mile a minute but you can't see what they're 

409.06 410.33 B: [laughter] 

412.42 421.32 B: yeah you can't make out what they're saying that would be great that's like perfect marketing they could have like one game like one game a week and it would just be like 

421.47 422.70 B: (( hilarious )) 

422.48 428.67 A: they tried doing that with um one of the football leagues i think it was the u._s._s._l. a couple of years back when they had it and they said 

428.77 434.73 A: there was one game where they had some some of the players miked and it was it was basically a 

434.78 435.75 A: un- 

435.88 442.00 A: um there wasn't any sports announcers it was just a just a game as if you were sitting at the game 

440.08 442.96 B: just a game and they were miked right oh nice 

442.57 446.40 A: and they had microphones all over the place and you can it was live and it was uncut 

446.71 454.56 A: and you can hear a lot of chatter on the sidelines even though they didn't have the players miked you had the microphones there and you can hear a lot of chatter because the announcers a a lot of times will 

454.46 455.36 B: right 

455.00 460.57 A: will overshadow the voices going down the field i would just love that one game 

458.02 458.86 B: true 

460.68 462.13 B: one game like 

462.20 464.86 B: just one big game like a play off game or something 

465.10 467.11 B: a fan a treat for the fans 

466.62 468.19 A: [laughter] 

468.24 473.67 A: treat us to something special let us hear the freaking mouths on these guys 

469.12 469.91 B: [laughter] 

470.34 471.42 B: you know 

473.31 474.55 B: [laughter] 

474.90 475.92 A: but uh 

474.99 478.28 B: well you couldn't do that on regular t._v. it just would never work 

477.99 479.34 A: no [noise] 

479.49 482.14 A: so i wonder what else they want us to yap about here 

481.66 482.95 B: yeah 

482.31 485.86 A: this i i would like to know what the heck this study's about 

485.56 488.02 B: i know you know that's all we that's 

488.51 493.35 B: i have no clue like i tried to go on the website and find out but there wasn't really a lot 

492.80 498.33 A: i've gotten on it doesn't tell you much either you know i i've been thinking about it and i think that the subjects they're doing 

498.12 510.09 A: i think what they're trying to do it's done through the university of penn so first of all it kind of gives me an idea that it's got to be something that has to do with um it's through the psychological department i was thinking that maybe it has to do with something like are they 

506.35 507.39 B: right 

509.95 516.75 A: to understand how people actually can people actually communicate on an intellectual level with each other giving us given any topic 

518.03 525.17 A: and if so can they you know can there be uh what kind of conversation is it just like oh let's talk about humor 

518.22 519.14 B: yeah 

525.58 527.94 A: or it can be actually intellectual conversation 

525.80 526.93 B: right 

528.38 531.92 B: i also suspect it might just be how to see how people 

532.25 542.26 B: 'cause ten minutes is kind of time like we went from comedy to like sports to like you know like to see how people drift away or how conversation evolves from one topic to another 

536.90 537.69 A: right 

542.23 548.13 A: yeah i could that could be the the other one too that actually kind of makes sense too it's like you know can we stay on the topic for ten minutes can 

544.50 545.43 B: yeah 

547.50 561.50 B: right 'cause every talk i've had i okay one of them we actually stayed on there but this is my third phone call the first phone calls they were like maybe a couple of minutes on whatever the topic was and it just kind of evolved it was never like a conscious decision but it just kind of drifts off to like you know 

561.61 564.11 B: general convo or something related 

563.62 565.29 A: right 

564.52 565.28 B: so 

565.80 567.78 B: that's kind of interesting 

567.19 570.59 A: speaking speaking of humor i'm sitting here watching an old marx brothers movie 

570.88 572.19 B: oh cool 

571.75 578.98 A: oh i love marx brothers they were like some of the most funniest movies ever made because it was just slapstick from beginning to end 

578.34 579.51 B: right 

579.07 586.28 A: and you know like why these old and i look at a lot of the old comedians you know i go back to richard i mean richard pryor was he was dirty as can be 

587.28 590.41 A: but he would never get personal 

588.56 591.63 B: but that wasn't a cop out right 

591.58 599.89 A: and you know you you look at some of these old i mean to me richard pryor or even lenny bruce have you ever watched lenny bruce old lenny bruce he was a filthy dirty pig
