30.26 31.60 A: [noise] i'll let you go

35.76 37.21 B: that you're speaking to 

37.42 39.23 A: uh or in

43.16 44.12 B: and 

44.37 47.06 B: it you know if you've if you 

45.19 46.07 A: but 

47.20 53.43 B: know them really well you know what to say and what not to say in other situations it can be more difficult if you aren't aware of their 

53.52 54.93 B: personal beliefs 

54.58 61.53 A: and what about if it's not uh personally i mean if you're not in a crowd of people and uh like on the internet 

60.14 62.79 B: just watching t._v. or on the internet 

61.55 64.18 A: or on the or watching t._v. correct 

64.41 69.19 B: um i don't i that's that's harder it's hard to it's hard to say 

67.99 70.36 A: i i guess it's a a personal 

69.74 74.67 B: yeah it depends on your own experiences and 

70.37 71.62 A: taste 

75.13 78.65 B: and what you what you're insulted by i think it varies with [noise] 

77.66 86.31 A: well that's correct i mean it's it uh i know that i personally am um offended by anything that that um 

87.05 87.90 A: (( [sigh] )) 

88.06 95.50 A: any kind of humor that uh denigrates any nationality or or uh religion 

92.72 93.66 B: right 

95.83 96.82 B: right 

95.93 101.46 A: and i'm also offended by uh anything that's overtly sexual 

100.84 101.89 B: right 

101.52 105.39 A: and especially as it relates to uh putting women down 

104.70 105.62 B: right 

105.85 107.87 A: so i guess that uh 

107.99 109.75 A: that's where i draw the line 

109.42 110.95 B: yeah i agree with you 

111.09 112.71 B: on those topics 

112.25 113.20 A: yeah 

113.29 114.42 A: um 

115.55 122.26 B: [noise] what do you feel like is there a specific example of something that's like mainstream popular that you 

122.08 122.75 A: [noise] 

122.42 124.42 B: think is in bad taste i 

123.99 125.17 A: um 

125.92 127.77 A: well 

126.92 130.42 B: mean a lot of people hate that show south park because

149.72 151.49 B: (( wayne's world yeah that's it )) 

150.37 153.44 A: well i i found that stupid and some 

153.66 165.80 A: and sometimes i find stupidity in humor offends me it's as if it's talking down or uh trying to approach me on a level that is just so such a waste of time 

157.72 158.57 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

159.98 161.10 B: right 

165.18 166.20 B: right 

166.09 175.98 A: so uh in that regard i i find that offensive and i draw the line there i just don't want any part of it and south park i don't know i i really can't speak to it 

175.36 176.63 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

176.18 177.33 A: um
