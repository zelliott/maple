3.47 6.14 A: pascal hi nice to meet you 

4.13 5.07 B: yes 

5.63 6.98 B: hi nice to meet you 

7.67 9.22 B: so where are you located 

8.88 11.45 A: i'm in los angeles california 

10.83 13.41 B: oh me too [laughter] okay 

11.83 14.12 A: (( oh okay really not too far )) 

13.86 14.61 B: (( mhm )) 

14.13 19.60 A: um so uh i guess we're supposed to talk about the minimum wage five fifteen 

18.09 18.91 B: (( yeah )) 

19.28 22.11 B: w- nine fifteen or five fifteen 

20.82 22.97 A: five five fifteen 

22.21 24.51 B: it's already six seventy five so um 

23.69 26.23 A: that's what i thought but 

25.51 27.47 B: so i'm a little confused 

28.21 29.55 B: so um 

28.80 32.58 A: maybe back in pennsylvania it's different i have no idea 

31.81 35.72 B: yeah maybe it's like a state uh a state price or something 

35.42 36.43 A: (( correct )) 

35.83 43.77 B: no i i think i mean i don't know how much it is before but i i think that they should increase it yeah i mean even in california it's six seventy five 

44.09 51.41 B: i mean it's so low that uh minimum wage that uh yeah i think it should be increased to six uh six dollars i don't know 

51.11 52.13 A: right 

52.46 54.15 B: so what do you do for a living 

54.11 55.98 A: i'm an accountant 

55.41 58.98 B: oh okay so you don't make the minimum wage [laughter] 

57.20 63.21 A: yeah i'm just trying to think like who makes the minimum wage and i guess it's probably your service people you know 

63.79 68.48 A: uh the retailers and the restaurant workers and whatnot 

68.50 69.39 A: but 

69.23 72.58 B: like mcdonald's and things people that work like that 

70.98 75.16 A: yeah that's what i'm thinking um what do you do 

73.52 74.83 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

75.21 77.73 B: i'm a trainer for a software company 

77.37 78.46 A: okay 

78.41 86.44 B: so yeah i i just uh no i just think that i don't know how people live with you know five dollars fifty it's probably five dollars fifty 

83.02 84.06 A: yeah 

84.19 85.10 A: right 

86.51 88.81 B: like in other states or something and uh 

88.30 89.20 A: (( maybe )) 

89.54 92.36 B: so yeah i think they should uh increase that because 

91.22 102.36 A: right i mean oh uh i mean the i'm trying to think the only time i really made like uh minimum wage or a little bit more than minimum wage was like back when i was like you know in high school and college and i worked in 

102.30 108.07 A: you know like a [lipsmack] department store in the mall or a candle shop in the mall so 

108.28 109.29 A: you know 

109.00 110.10 B: oh really 

109.66 121.82 A: yeah and like as a college kid you know to me that was a lotta money uh but i c- you know a lotta people do that as a full time job as their living the only source of income and 

110.47 111.06 B: (( [cough] )) 

122.32 127.94 A: that's gonna make it hard for them the cost of living is really high especially here in california 

126.06 126.89 B: yeah 

127.58 140.36 B: yeah i just i i you know even with six seventy five here i don't know how they how they do it but uh i mean if someone makes five dollars an hour you know it's five dollars gross so less uh thirty percent or twenty five percent or 

139.08 139.88 A: right 

140.27 143.65 B: or maybe twenty percent for the taxes i don't i don't know 

142.83 147.89 A: yeah like they keep raising taxes well lately they've been decreasing it but 

148.05 153.27 A: you know it just seems like you know if you're gonna increase taxes you gotta increase 

153.82 155.66 A: the minimum wage as well 

155.40 156.57 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

155.97 160.47 A: but i can also understand from an employer perspective 

160.68 167.17 A: it becomes too high a price to stay in business in california and then you're gonna drive out businesses 

167.36 168.29 B: yeah 

167.85 169.38 A: um you know 

169.69 173.16 A: i heard like a little while ago like how santa monica 

173.20 177.97 A: all the hotel peop- i think this was about a year ago where all the hotel people had um 

178.85 179.41 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

179.46 184.49 A: r- raised the minimum wage for just santa monica or something to that effect and 

184.23 188.10 B: uh yeah i think i remember it was in the hotel business or something 

187.60 189.04 A: yeah 

188.51 196.86 B: yeah yeah service people like uh restaurant and hotels and yeah i think there was like um like a big controversy about that 

194.06 195.08 A: (( there were like )) 

196.17 200.03 A: yeah there was and you know so you know it's good for the p- 

200.18 209.75 A: the workers you know to make more money but it's also bad from an economic standpoint in a sense that it you know businesses are gonna either cut costs by 

209.77 210.69 B: yeah 

210.26 213.34 A: not hiring that many people or whatnot but [sigh] 

213.41 224.44 B: i know but i mean i i understand why wait- waiters and waitresses they make like you know the minimum wage because they get tips you know so it it increases i mean s- 

221.24 222.23 A: correct 

224.42 238.79 B: i heard of some mait- waitresses they make like i don't know two hundred three hundred dollars ever night if they look at if they work at bars or things like this but when you only rely on your minimum wage i mean how can you live off uh five dollars five fifty or even six dollars or 

228.57 230.63 A: a night yeah exactly 

238.57 239.60 A: mhm 

238.92 245.47 B: six yeah the six seven- six seventy five for california but it's like uh i don't know i think that they should uh 

245.62 255.87 B: i mean i don't uh the the thing of this they should have told us how much it was before and what's the increase you know what so we can talk about that but [sigh] then see that it's like a ten percent increase 

252.93 254.23 A: (( see if it's enough )) 

256.07 257.43 B: i mean you know 

257.53 262.46 B: uh i know that uh um my uh my husband's um 

263.07 269.06 B: my husband he's from [sigh] uh pennsylvania and over there the price of the um of the houses 

268.73 270.12 A: mhm 

269.45 275.82 B: you know when you when you buy something uh you can buy something like around eighty or ninety thousand dollars 

275.32 276.55 A: mhm 

276.04 282.22 B: for a small house two bedroom or something like this so compared to here yeah of course it's less expensive 

281.94 283.58 A: absolutely 

282.88 290.30 B: but i mean the houses are less expensive but i'm sure that the milk and the bread you know i mean there's not that much difference you know what i mean 

289.96 292.94 A: yeah well actually you know um [lipsmack] 

293.70 299.97 A: i have some family in texas and when i went back there 'cause i know like housing costs is they're the big difference 

299.64 300.47 B: (( mhm )) 

299.82 309.12 A: and i went to their supermarket which is basically you know how like we have um gilson's and pavilions where it's a little bit more expensive than you know the roberts 

306.03 306.85 B: yes 

307.37 308.09 B: yes 

308.48 309.26 B: yes 

309.11 315.84 A: and well they brought me to that market and even that market to them was expensive was still cheaper than us 

315.57 316.40 B: oh 

315.65 327.33 A: like milk was probably you know okay like a a half gallon was like probably fifty to sixty cents less and you know little things like that start to add up and that's considered their expensive supermarket you know 

318.49 319.27 B: like 

326.50 328.52 B: okay uh-huh uh-huh i see 

327.58 329.20 A: i was just like [mn] 

329.53 343.37 A: and gas is a lot cheaper there i mean i'm paying a you know a dollar eighty for the regular and they're paying you know a dollar seventy for premium so it's it's it's outta sight but and anyway um 

339.10 340.05 B: oh yeah 

341.09 341.88 B: yeah 

344.03 353.55 B: see if we compare to five nineteen from six seventy five that's uh [sigh] um yeah i mean it's uh it's almost twenty percent less than uh 

348.62 350.01 A: really low 

350.12 350.81 A: [laughter] 

353.87 360.14 B: than they would get i mean it's like a i don't know how much it is before i didn't understand if it's five nineteen or five ninety 

360.49 361.76 B: that they want to increase 

360.81 362.71 A: i think it's five one five 

362.40 364.77 B: five one five oh five fifteen 

363.30 364.12 A: yes 

364.46 365.41 A: (( yeah )) 

365.14 366.63 B: oh okay okay 

366.11 369.66 A: that i think is what i heard but yeah i mean 

367.44 368.53 B: yeah so 

370.11 375.47 A: as from a worker perspective i think it's always nice to have increases 

375.20 375.94 B: yeah 

375.57 380.11 A: um especially if the cost of living is going up i would exp- 

380.41 382.02 A: expect that 

382.60 386.59 A: um minimum wage would at least go up by the same percentage 

386.10 388.43 B: yes yes i would i would agree 

386.92 387.87 A: (( so )) 

388.23 397.08 A: um you know whether or not i don't know particularly which state they're talking about five fifteen you know i'm not quite sure if that's sufficient enough but 

396.43 397.22 B: mhm 

397.10 398.09 A: (( you know )) 

399.49 401.24 B: yeah just um 

401.33 403.99 B: i don't know i i think that um 

405.03 412.87 B: that frankly uh five fifteen for uh i mean even in considering i think that's a that's really a minimum i mean 

412.95 417.35 B: you know if you have to live that what what does it make like per week it's like uh 

417.40 422.10 B: so uh five five dollars fo- time forty that's two hundred dollars a week 

421.88 422.76 A: right 

422.44 424.75 B: so it's eight hundred dollars a month 

424.56 427.70 A: yeah and you know there are parts of philadelphia 

427.85 431.96 A: in pennsylvania excuse me that is really expensive you know i mean 

431.05 431.89 B: yeah 

432.15 434.62 A: i have a friend in college there 

434.70 440.64 A: and he's paying two thousand dollars a month for a one bedroom apartment near campus and i'm 

440.07 440.81 B: oh 

440.93 447.64 A: i'm like you're a college kid you know how can you afford that and he's obviously not even working so 

443.51 444.71 B: wow 

448.37 458.21 A: i'm sure there's parts of you know but i have another friend in um another part of pennsylvania pennsylvania um [lipsmack] he's at uh 

455.63 456.37 B: uh-huh 

458.35 471.47 A: penn state and my friend that's paying two thousand is a- at university of pennsylvania but the one that's at penn state is paying five hundred dollars a month so i guess it just depends on where you are within that state 

466.80 467.72 B: (( right )) 

471.10 471.97 B: yeah 

471.55 472.47 A: so 

472.70 483.96 B: yeah and and i would think that um i mean even if you know the students but like a real worker and you have a family then i mean you know your wife must work also because if you make five dollars an hour 

478.33 479.31 A: mhm 

483.74 484.60 A: right 

484.15 487.27 B: you know how can you you cannot raise a family with that so 

486.78 487.69 A: right 

487.55 489.32 B: i mean i don't think you can 

488.34 494.09 A: and we want people you know servicing us in the restaurants and the hotels and the malls so 

494.33 496.17 A: you know we need them to 

496.27 501.85 A: be happy and [laughter] be able to afford you know a comfortable life 

497.96 499.16 B: yeah i i think 

500.21 501.08 B: yeah 

501.38 505.98 B: yeah and and f- but for me you know um when i when i look at the economy 

505.59 506.52 A: mhm 

505.86 516.59 B: i'm a i'm from switzerland originally so if i look at the american economy then i see that the gap between the poor and the rich is getting bigger and bigger you know 

508.95 509.75 A: (( oh )) 

515.80 516.85 A: it is 

516.54 526.67 B: because it's either you make five dollars an hour because you're minimum wage or you make uh two hundred thousand a year because you're a you know you're a vice president of a a company or something 

523.11 523.93 A: yeah 

526.88 531.39 B: and um i mean it's a huge difference you know when i see um 

531.58 532.98 A: that's a good point 

531.70 532.53 B: uh 

532.84 547.66 B: yeah so i i don't know when i see sometimes like customer service they start like at nine dollars here in california and that's considered good you know to start when you don't have a degree when you know when you're when you have nothing but 

540.35 541.52 A: mhm 

545.46 546.31 A: right 

547.69 553.53 B: i think it's still uh i don't i don't know how people can live because you know i don't make that much more that that much money but uh 

553.90 561.67 B: [sigh] i could never imagine getting paid five dollars an hour that's that's crazy so i would totally agree that they should raise that you know 

562.21 565.66 B: i don't know how much it was it was probably like um [sigh] 

565.69 571.20 B: like from five dollars to five fifteen so it's probably like a five percent uh increase 

567.87 569.46 A: (( yeah [laughter] right that's right )) 

571.40 572.22 A: (( right )) 

572.02 576.06 B: or something like this but uh yeah i don't know just um [sigh] [cough] 

576.53 590.61 A: yeah it it's it would be tough in california so if you're asking for you know if the question is you know is five fifteen enough for california i would you know strongly say no and obviously it's high- a lot higher in california um 

590.80 592.93 A: but if it is in pennsylvania 

593.34 599.47 A: i mean if i had to pay two thousand dollars a month in rent i don't think five fifteen's enough but 

599.22 599.89 B: no of
