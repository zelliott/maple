90.15 92.85 B: i thought it was yeah like six seventy five an hour here 

92.33 100.91 A: that's what i think it is i just thought it was so it's not a federal [mn] it sounds like minimum wage isn't federal it it must be state 

93.80 94.65 B: yeah 

99.01 100.18 B: yeah 

100.30 112.84 B: yeah i already knew that because my sons live in kansas and minimum wage there is like five seventy five an hour there so i guess probably it might even vary from county to county i don't know or state wide 'cause i know at least from state to state i know it varies 

105.79 107.35 A: oh 

109.63 111.39 A: oh i i think it's a 

112.27 121.55 A: yeah i don't think it varies from county to county and the cost of living in kansas versus the cost of living in california obviously is different so i guess they take 

117.91 120.22 B: yeah it's different of course oh oh yeah 

120.43 121.41 B: i mean 

121.55 122.88 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

122.61 128.29 A: they take that under consideration if you're you know gonna be talking you know if you're 

124.84 125.72 B: yeah 

128.36 134.94 A: i mean i live in northern california in one of the most expensive i live in a place called marine county do you know where

135.16 136.74 A: yeah i'm in marine i'm 

136.82 143.12 A: i'm right by sausalito and it you take under consideration the cost i mean people 

143.14 146.84 A: i grew up here the people that lived here um 

147.07 149.31 A: you know that i grew up with 

148.82 150.07 B: mhm 

149.45 154.51 A: they've all moved north because it's just too expensive to live here it's ridiculous i mean 

153.83 155.86 B: yeah well i live 

154.74 156.50 A: it's very affluent 

156.32 167.13 B: well where i live at it's not it's not the low end and it's not the high end well actually it's not really middle it's like in between middle class and and poverty i guess it's you know i mean 

166.52 168.64 A: where are you in southern california 

167.42 171.71 B: it's it's uh i'm in l._a. county a little town called tahonga 

171.96 173.55 A: i've heard of tahonga 

173.14 174.39 B: yeah 

173.56 174.89 A: are yeah 

174.44 186.11 B: but minimum wage here i mean if you have if you had two people making minimum wage you might be able to get by paying your rent and just get and to have enough money to to buy food and pay your bills but you know um 

184.72 188.49 A: right exactly exactly i mean it's 

186.37 192.39 B: you know but if you have one person making minimum wage and the other person making more then you can do all right here in this area 

191.63 198.00 A: right and and in this area you know like if you they're all you know i mean they're trying to have if if 

198.05 202.33 A: there's a couple of things if you're living in substadi- subsidized housing here 

201.46 208.92 B: right yeah there's some well i i think here there's not as much as there used to be 'cause i think the landlords can't afford to uh 

202.76 203.81 A: or 

208.97 212.13 B: to pay for it any more you know their part of it like they used to be able to 

211.75 221.34 A: you mean the section eight kind of thing actually section eight a lot of people i know up in this area i've got friends that have bought real estate like in up north just for 

213.47 214.48 B: yeah 

221.39 225.19 A: that purpose you know so that because you're guaranteed 

223.04 223.87 B: yeah 

225.38 234.30 A: you're absolutely guaranteed your rent if you know a or the larger portion of it if you rent to a subsidized you know to section eight families 

231.57 232.54 B: yeah 

233.53 242.87 B: yeah and if you if you make more than minimum wage if you make more than minimum wage most of the time you can't you can't uh you know get subsidized housing or a section eight 

234.67 236.32 A: but that's the only way 

236.79 237.57 A: yeah 

241.75 245.41 A: that's right well you c- well the point is you can 

245.30 246.86 B: yeah but it but it de- 

245.45 251.26 A: but but it's gonna yeah it'll affect it'll affect your um it'll it'll affect your 

249.31 251.28 B: right right 

251.16 262.83 B: yeah you can make more than a little bit more than minimum wage say if you make ten buck- or say eight bucks to nine bucks an hour you might get subsidized housing but then only one person can work and the other one can't like the husband can work and the wife can't i guess you know 

251.32 252.52 A: (( yeah it [sigh] )) 

262.69 274.71 B: and also well i knew somebody who was in subsidized housing and he made more than minimum wage he's made like he made made like eight or nine like nine bucks an hour and but they have five kids and his wife didn't work she stayed home and that way they qualified for it 

273.80 287.34 A: [noise] yeah you can but you can qualify anyway at this point with section eight it just depends when you um 'cause i'm living in subsidized housing and it just you know it just depends [mn] the biggest thing is it really depends on when 

281.19 282.04 B: (( oh yeah )) 

287.60 296.59 A: um you know how much y- you know your it's a portion of whatever your your rent would be you know it's a portion of whatever your salary would be over the table 

295.05 295.95 B: yeah 

296.45 298.13 B: yeah it's um 

296.60 298.07 A: you know so 

298.12 306.11 A: i mean i live in a great place it's it's a you wouldn't know that it was subsidized housing it's such a nice complex yeah it's beautiful 

303.74 304.75 B: oh yeah 

304.80 309.04 B: where i live it's a complex i mean it's okay it's it's you know i mean there's 

308.94 323.68 B: there's places that well i mean if both my wife and i made minimum wage we could still afford to live here if both of us were working but right now i'm the only only one working right now but if we were both to make minimum wage we could still afford we'd squeak by we could afford it but we'd barely squeak by 

316.26 317.54 A: right 

318.03 319.17 A: right 

322.30 336.51 A: well i think minimum wage is really just for ch- you know kids that are just getting you know that are in high school i mean there's just i don't see how people can live on it a lot of the hispanic community it's you know people that are you know that have got their green card 

331.17 332.32 B: well 

332.42 333.48 B: yeah 

334.84 335.72 B: yeah 

336.42 338.13 B: yeah but uh 

336.85 343.43 A: you know it's amazing how they they it's amazing how they can make ends meet i just it blows my mind 

343.03 345.22 B: i know there's some people that um 

343.49 346.92 A: you know it's just they're so resourceful that way 

346.51 359.99 B: yeah there's some people that make minimum wage i know in this area that they have like two maybe um three or four people in the family making minimum wage and that's how they get by but of course then you know those kinda people get food stamps and things like that to survive on you know so 

355.12 356.55 A: right 

359.30 360.91 A: right exactly 

360.47 363.26 B: that's how they can buy their groceries and that sort of thing 

361.93 369.29 A: it's just i don't think you can live on minimum wage any other way at least in in california and that's it's just i don't know how 

365.55 366.74 B: yeah 

367.24 368.33 B: yeah 

369.30 377.68 A: i just don't think minimum wage is is truly fair i mean they don't want people to be on welfare but then people don't wanna pay a decent 

373.10 374.92 B: i know i i think that 

377.64 378.91 B: [noise] right 

378.31 386.61 A: amount of money you can work at um like a place called um [lipsmack] oh what's it called it's a burger place uh gosh i can't remember 

385.16 394.45 B: well i know in and out pays more than minimum wage they they they're the ones that they're the one fast food hamburger place that pays more than minimum wage i think it 

387.15 389.81 A: like that's what i'm that's what i'm it was 

391.54 392.34 A: yeah 

393.27 402.48 A: they pay like nine fifty an hour or nine to nine fifty an hour with benefits which is very encouraging if you're you know if you're trying to 

394.84 397.43 B: yeah something like that yeah yeah 

397.81 398.93 B: right yeah yeah 

401.75 405.83 B: i don't know if they pay nine fifty i think they pay maybe pay eight to eight fifty down here 

405.20 410.56 A: not here they pay it up here they pay nine yeah plus benefits 

406.95 408.62 B: oh really oh 

408.79 418.16 B: well that's good that's that's good i mean that's that's not very that's not bad money if you two p- two a couple and you're making nine bucks an hour you can get by pretty well you know depending on where you live of course 

417.24 425.69 A: sure or if you're young and you're getting ready to go away to college or your high school money or whatever you know part time it's true it's it's not easy 

418.22 419.19 B: you know 

422.48 424.36 B: right yeah 

425.64 426.45 B: yeah

430.41 431.23 B: yeah 

430.46 433.03 A: i mean if you look at we don't have [mn] 

433.05 446.39 A: we don't take care of if you look at how much it costs just for medical coverage we our country should be paying for we should be they they should be paying for medi- free medical coverage social 

438.58 439.71 B: oh yeah 

445.40 448.01 B: especially for people who make minimum wage 

446.39 459.44 A: medicine for everybody- especially you know there are no perks the only perk they've got from people that are making min- win- minimum wage is um what's it called earn income earned no earned income credit 

455.73 456.88 B: food stamps 

458.59 462.32 B: right yeah and and food stamps that's the only benefit they get yeah
