1.63 2.89 A: hello 

2.46 6.26 B: oh hello [laughter] h- hi my name is gwen 

3.78 4.93 A: (( hi there )) 

6.40 7.42 A: hi gwen 

8.13 9.99 B: and um and what is yo- 

8.31 14.48 A: so our topic is the minimum wage and how we feel whether five fifteen is ah sufficient 

14.54 19.13 B: well actually [sigh] for me it's not that because i'm actually here in canada 

19.03 20.55 A: oh really [laughter] 

19.96 27.36 B: so but i i think five fifteen is definitely not [laughter] [laughter] i 

24.00 25.70 A: sufficient oh no 

26.27 27.50 A: i agree 

27.53 42.35 B: i think that's [noise] -finitely below what it should be certainly if we're talking about adults who have been in the workforce before and ah might have to start off again if they've been laid off or whatever i definitely don't think it's enough [laughter] 

40.22 41.02 A: exac- 

42.28 52.19 A: yeah th- they're having to restart their lives and they're having to start off at the beginning at five fifteen that's not enough for them to make their bill payments and anything else 

52.29 53.58 A: that may be 

53.64 66.74 B: yeah i i i don't know how anybody is even on your own i think it would be really kind of hard to to make ah ends meet because you would end up in places where you don't necessarily want to live or you end up living with a 

66.98 71.16 B: a number of roommates because they don't have any other choice 

68.47 69.79 A: exactly 

70.42 74.95 A: it wouldn't be enough to pay your rent and have enough to you know 

75.19 79.94 A: for your meals and so forth you'd have to depend on some other source of income 

78.82 81.11 B: yeah yeah that's right 

80.31 83.70 A: even working up to forty hours you know a week 

82.27 85.72 B: yeah that's right yeah whereabouts do you live 

85.48 87.12 A: ah in texas 

86.59 92.11 B: oh okay and is it is it five fifteen like across the board to like um 

92.06 93.28 A: see that 

92.17 93.87 B: in all of the states 

93.46 102.10 A: i believe that's gonna to be the increase that they're looking towards if i'm correct it's four ninety five or somewhere along that lines currently 

98.16 99.09 B: oh 

101.19 102.39 B: oh my 

102.46 115.24 A: ah i've never been close to it so that's why i don't much attention to it shame on me for doing that but [laughter] yeah now i feel certainly i don't see how anyone could afford you know anything on that type of salary 

106.19 107.13 B: (( mm )) 

108.17 109.09 B: (( mm )) 

109.26 110.24 B: (( 'cause )) 

115.19 122.93 B: mhm yeah well it just seems like [laughter] considering you know you know when you think of the depression an- and um you know y- 

122.95 133.30 B: the years ah around that time [mn] i mean they it's not like they were paid very much then either but when you consider that that's quite a few years ago and you think of now 

132.08 134.95 A: yeah and how the economy was at that time 

134.73 136.99 B: yeah that's right 

136.94 142.11 A: so at that time prices and everything also were far lower compared to now 

137.13 138.40 B: (( you know i'm really ki- )) 

140.43 141.50 B: mhm 

142.06 150.49 B: yeah i'm surprised that the minimum wage is is so low 'cause i mean it's not that high here but here it's each province has a different um 

150.50 152.29 B: minimum wage because 

151.51 152.45 A: do they 

152.32 159.70 B: 'cause where we are in d._c. here it's um i think it's it's finally now eight dollars an hour which i don't think is that much either 

159.39 160.25 A: (( oh wow mhm )) 

160.37 164.55 B: but ah [sigh] but still [sigh] yeah i i 

164.79 168.04 B: as far as minimum wage goes i i think that um 

168.50 170.74 B: you should be able to start somewhat 

170.75 177.63 B: higher because i know that small businesses sometimes find it difficult to be able to provide more than that 

177.90 181.12 B: but ah but a lot of sorry 

178.83 179.83 A: (( i wonder if )) 

180.00 183.66 A: i wonder how they go about figuring out the amount 

183.92 195.75 A: you know do they actually take into consideration or do a budget for an average american or something along that lines and set it up that way or what what would be the way that they'd actually figure out the minimum wage 

193.52 194.57 B: [noise] 

194.61 205.93 B: yeah yeah i really i i don't know 'cause i'm i just think that some states are far more expensive and some are less expensive to live in so that i think that 

203.45 205.38 A: (( [noise] yeah that's true [noise] [noise] )) 

206.01 208.48 B: i think it would be better to have [noise] um 

208.53 218.64 B: a minimum wage that would be actually um dictated by the state and and not and not just ah across the country 'cause i don't think that's a very 

214.85 215.67 A: (( i know )) 

215.86 216.98 A: yeah 

218.78 220.53 B: good way of doing it 

219.98 223.30 A: well that's true 'cause in california i mean 

223.78 228.01 A: it's far more costly than it would be in texas to live 

228.69 229.86 B: mhm 

229.63 233.45 A: goodness gracious is this your first survey participated in 

233.51 238.71 B: um actually no i had another one the other day ah we were discussing pets 

238.61 239.66 A: really 

239.58 242.02 B: so [laughter] oh 

239.74 243.21 A: oh how interesting this is my first one [laughter] 

242.60 244.93 B: okay all right 

243.96 246.41 A: so i was new to the whole process 

246.04 248.42 B: mhm mhm mhm 

246.50 251.48 A: [laughter] what else are we say about the minimum wage [laughter] 

251.54 258.13 B: yeah well actually is this something that's just um coming down right now or is this something that 

258.35 259.29 B: um 

258.39 272.97 A: yeah i suppose it's something that's being lobbied for i haven't heard of a of a major you know and a how would you say in the news or anything along that lines so i'm supposing it's just a proposition of 

261.43 263.25 B: mhm 

273.22 274.60 A: in place 

275.09 276.28 B: mhm 

275.86 279.07 A: but officially i have not heard anything to that effect 

279.27 281.14 B: (( hm yuk )) 

280.08 284.57 A: but like when i heard the topic i was like oh this will be interesting [laughter] 

283.41 296.08 B: yeah yeah well the thing is if you have minimum wage that doesn't mean that you're getting very many benefits on top of that either especially if you're looking at part time employment if that's the only wage you're getting then 

290.42 291.52 A: (( that's true )) 

295.74 297.93 A: yeah part timers get no benefits 

297.79 299.29 B: that's right 

298.08 307.52 A: and a lot of companies are heading towards um hiring more part time people than full time in fact in my company you know they they encourage 

303.07 304.05 B: mhm 

307.84 311.77 A: for you know us to go ahead and look for a part time new person 

311.82 313.46 B: mhm 

312.84 313.64 A: so 

313.76 316.14 A: that also plays into effect 

315.87 321.05 B: yeah that's right yeah i sometimes see that in the papers here too that sometimes you see part time and you 

321.06 331.08 B: you kind of wonder why they're doing that if it's just so that they don't have to pay some of the other benefits or if it's that ah [sigh] yeah it's sometimes hard to know 

329.07 340.61 A: yeah yeah they're looking towards the benefits and then also i think they part time people they usually consider that they've a student ah a a younger crowd because those are the individuals who don't 

340.73 343.75 A: you know need to work full time they're so 

344.08 346.83 A: [noise] unless they was at home and being supported by someone else [noise] 

346.86 353.18 B: that's right yeah well that's what minimum wage is good for but i guess that it's hard to be able to um 

354.35 360.24 B: basically put a regulation to effect and say that minimum wage is only gonna be for a certain age or you know 

359.87 361.12 A: yeah that's true 

360.13 370.52 B: for high school students or for young people they can't really do that so that would be discriminatory [laughter] so yeah 

366.57 368.19 A: (( that's why they use true )) 

368.59 375.20 A: can you imagine if they did my goodness [laughter] we'd be rich [laughter] 

371.10 372.23 B: [laughter] 

373.03 375.07 B: yeah mhm 

375.95 376.70 B: (( mm )) 

376.29 377.49 A: wow 

376.90 378.97 B: how long have you lived in texas 

378.73 380.24 A: (( ah all my life )) 

380.10 381.31 B: oh really 

380.71 384.94 A: yeah i've always lived in texas i have a friend who's from canada as well 

381.49 382.25 B: (( hm )) 

384.88 386.11 B: mhm 

385.51 388.10 A: and she's ah in texas now 

388.16 389.02 B: (( mm )) 

389.46 390.17 B: (( mm )) 

391.05 395.81 B: yeah actually my husband he he knew somebody who um [sigh] 

396.68 408.43 B: from way back when who now lives in texas he works for an american company he's canadian himself but he ah yeah he lives i believe in texas so i guess he got a good job down there [lipsmack] 

401.77 403.06 A: yeah oh well 

405.56 406.68 A: (( oh oh wow mm true )) 

408.67 415.53 B: i think they're also looking at least they were recruiting for nurses i think also in texas among other states 

415.62 417.78 B: because of the i guess it 

417.41 420.29 A: yeah that's a very popular ah job at the moment 

420.08 425.39 B: mhm yeah and i guess they get better wages and benefits and everything else but mhm 

424.56 425.88 A: oh certainly 

426.24 428.44 A: they start off at a really high 

428.64 432.75 A: ah salary rate oh no they are really correct yeah 

434.29 436.06 B: yeah 

436.34 439.26 B: are you in a d- a city there or a town or 

438.96 442.98 A: i'm ah in west texas in el paso 

443.10 452.23 B: oh okay yeah i know it's well i've heard of it i've never been in [noise] texas that's one of the states i've not been in i've been in a lot of other states but not not quite 

444.25 445.35 A: yeah 

452.31 457.76 B: as far s- well i guess it's let's see 'cause colorado is still a little bit further 

458.05 460.79 B: further up i believe yeah 

459.19 462.58 A: exactly yeah we're at the bottom bottom [laughter] 

461.36 469.25 B: yeah yeah that's right yeah so that's as far south as i've been is colorado and also california going 

463.26 464.50 A: yeah 

469.32 470.83 B: more to the west 

470.51 471.60 A: (( oh i )) 

471.54 476.68 B: but ah i've been more like in the midwestern and and the and the 

474.33 476.45 A: (( see mhm )) 

476.69 480.03 B: northwestern states mostly yeah 

480.91 481.83 A: (( oh my )) 

481.28 481.88 B: (( [noise] [sigh] )) 

484.11 488.67 A: hm i'm trying to think of any other topics with regard to minimum wage 

489.69 495.91 A: i haven't had minimum wage in the longest time [laughter] so i guess that's why i don't pay too much attention to it [laughter] 

491.91 492.99 B: [laughter] 

494.90 506.47 B: mm well i must say that i i actually i wasn't even quite sure of the minimum wage here until i saw recently something about that it had been raised and and and i thought 

506.38 514.81 B: i thought actually it was a bit higher than than it it actually is at the moment so i wasn't quite in the know about minimum wage here either 

514.58 517.59 A: you said that it was somewhat about eight dollars there wow hm 

516.70 528.37 B: yeah yeah but i thought actually it was supposed to be a bit more than that but i guess it wasn't [sigh] but even so i think eight dollars an hour isn't really that high either when you consider 

528.34 533.52 B: well especially where i live um i'm not in vancouver but i'm ah 

534.48 541.23 B: an about an hour's drive from vancouver and [sigh] and in the greater vancouver area it's ah 

541.28 548.04 B: well especially in vancouver itself it's quite expensive here where i am in in abbotsford it's a city 

548.19 553.60 B: it's ah further south closer to the border of washington and um 

550.97 551.93 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

553.69 554.34 B: (( [mn] )) 

554.50 558.86 B: here it's somewhat less expensive in terms of housing and stuff but still 

559.43 560.82 B: when you think about 

560.92 565.62 B: um minimum wage and um we have a family of three here so 

562.59 564.22 A: yeah y- 

565.30 567.81 A: you'd certainly not be able to make it on that 

567.59 569.91 B: no no not really [sigh] 

570.06 570.79 A: hm 

570.23 571.53 B: yeah 

571.90 578.51 A: and and ah canada is it set up the the minimum wage is across the board or is it set up within 

577.62 590.51 B: i don't think so as far as i know yeah each each ah province has their own minimum wage so actually some of the eastern coast provinces like newfoundland and that i think have actually lower minimum wage even 

590.62 596.53 B: which to me it seems like oh [laughter] i don't know how they how they manage hm you 

595.13 598.10 A: they manage yeah hm 

598.10 598.96 B: (( know )) 

599.22 599.95 B: but
