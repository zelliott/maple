0.28 2.11 B: hi this is dana 

1.58 3.87 A: hi my name's tracey how are you 

3.81 4.88 B: good 

4.68 5.88 A: good 

5.44 9.96 B: i didn't know what the minimum wage was [laughter] so i'm glad that it said it's five fifteen 

10.07 14.45 A: that's really low um i live in california and our minimum wage is six seventy five 

14.19 15.38 B: oh wow 

15.06 21.32 A: so um yeah five fifteen [laughter] really low [laughter] compared to what we're getting 

21.69 24.60 B: (( yes and i think any wage )) 

24.76 25.84 B: um 

27.33 32.59 B: co- y- it has to be compared to cost to live like in california the cost of living would be quite a bit higher 

32.39 33.29 A: right 

33.29 35.82 B: and some place else it would be lower 

36.46 44.81 B: um but um i what are minimum wage jobs are those mostly like fast food and what else is 

43.94 45.20 A: retail 

45.31 46.50 B: (( retail mhm )) 

45.98 53.41 A: retail fast food yeah anything um like those anything where you don't have um probably specific training 

53.76 54.58 A: um 

55.02 58.23 A: skills that you would probably take a minimum wage job 

58.10 70.79 A: i saw like on oprah winfrey this is probably about a year ago she did this story on minimum wage when a book came out it's called nickeled and dimed it was a journalist who tried to survive on minimum wage jobs throughout the united states 

70.64 81.68 A: and they said that a living wage like a person can live um just struggling not you know living well on ten dollars an hour they would need ten dollars an hour to live 

81.87 82.73 B: wow 

82.01 89.43 A: and that then most people who work in minimum wage jobs work many other jobs probably are receiving like government assistance 

89.21 90.17 B: mhm 

90.03 93.72 A: um i don't think that people can survive on minimum wage 

94.31 108.82 B: no i don't think a like a a grown up you know maintaining their own residence their own transportation whatever that is fully responsible for themselves i don't think that a minimum wage job is enough to cover all your basics 

108.55 109.44 A: right 

110.65 117.20 A: right yeah for teenagers i guess it would be something different but if a person is say working at wal mart 

117.25 121.78 A: and this is how they support their family they'd wouldn't be able to do that on minimum wage 

121.71 122.85 B: right 

123.08 130.70 B: right and there are [mn] different jobs i think that pay minimum wage i think a lot of manual labor construction jobs pay more 

130.88 131.70 A: right 

131.07 143.28 B: than minimum wage i don't know what you would start at um and then you would probably get some training on the job kind of a thing and ah maybe be able to advance that way i think there are 

144.03 149.51 B: things that a person could try if they were willing that don't require training or education 

150.18 154.96 B: um but i think it's a hard ro- [laughter] hard road to go 

155.03 156.08 A: mhm 

156.76 160.01 B: on the other hand if you increase the minimum wage 

160.71 164.67 B: even higher then that would increase the prices to everyone 

164.76 177.63 A: right 'cause um i have a friend who owns a small video rental store in my home town and when minimum wage went up this last january in california he had to raise the prices of his rental 

177.78 181.31 A: which would send people to go elsewhere where it's cheaper 

181.50 189.55 A: but he couldn't afford to continue to rent at that at that rate and allow pe- and keep people working for him 

189.40 190.36 B: right 

189.93 191.58 A: to pay the minimum wage 

191.67 192.60 B: right 

193.15 199.28 B: yeah that's that's kind of ah on one hand we want everyone to have the basics of life and want everyone to 

199.46 206.72 B: you know be able to make a a living wage on the other hand though the prices that would be involved 

207.57 215.45 B: if everybody made ten dollars an hour if ten dollars an hour [laughter] were the minimum wage i think people would be surprised how much a happy meal would cost 

216.06 216.88 A: true 

217.91 218.67 A: true 

219.51 222.33 A: yeah the costs have to be absorbed somewhere 

223.91 227.94 A: so then you'd just be at the same thing nobody can live on ten dollars an hour 

227.99 233.43 B: right because the prices right because then the prices would be so high of the whatever 

228.20 230.32 A: that's what the argument would end up being 

233.34 247.33 B: because yes i can see that i can see that when i visit california i'm always shocked just to go to the grocery store and how much milk costs or how much a dozen eggs costs and then you think well they have to pay these wages so then the p- the 

233.35 234.33 A: mhm 

247.37 258.04 B: the those have to be recovered somehow or partially recovered okay so those are the prices but it's just like you said then how do they live at that wage [laughter] when the prices you know are that 

257.92 258.93 A: right 

259.81 260.66 A: right 

260.01 261.85 B: so th- that's a tough one 

261.81 270.36 A: yeah 'cause my brother lives in oklahoma um he's in the military but he was try- he was thinking of getting like a second job that he was looking i think he said it's 

270.60 272.13 A: about five 

272.73 280.16 A: thirty is the minimum wage there in oklahoma i think it's something around that and he was like that's some that's not that much [laughter] 

280.12 281.29 B: no it's not 

280.35 284.62 A: for minimum wage but now i remember when i first started working it was four twenty five an hour 

284.79 288.45 A: but i was a waitress so tips made the difference 

287.78 290.25 B: right i remember three sixty five 

290.06 293.33 A: uh-huh and you know you couldn't have lived on that 

292.86 296.27 B: no but i was a teenager or then um 

297.41 299.12 B: you know i was a student 

298.95 300.02 A: mhm 

299.34 302.38 B: and it to me it was kind of extra money 

302.44 303.34 A: right 

302.88 310.32 B: but there are people that for whatever circumstances you know i mean would go some place during the day there are adults 

310.95 313.14 B: working at minimum wage jobs 

312.75 313.64 A: mhm 

316.20 321.14 A: yeah but i don't feel that they can they can survive they usually that's their second job 

321.01 322.10 B: really 

321.81 326.44 A: so i guess maybe the answer is like more training programs 

326.68 332.30 A: so that people who need to support their families can either get the education or the training that they need 

332.40 336.30 A: so that they don't have to try and work three minimum wage jobs 

337.36 345.97 A: the books that i r- that i read that was featured on oprah that's w- what she did she like worked in florida as like a um a hotel maid 

337.51 338.39 B: sure 

346.47 350.70 A: um and she worked somewhere else on the east coast at a wal mart 

351.64 356.75 A: and for minimum wage and she you know you can't afford anything you can't pay rent 

357.48 361.77 A: mm i live about an about twenty minutes north of los angeles 

361.78 366.18 A: and our rent for a two bedroom is about twelve hundred dollars 

365.92 366.76 B: right 

366.60 369.00 A: so you couldn't afford that [laughter] on minimum wage 

369.25 370.49 B: right 

370.64 374.52 A: it's when a lot of people out here have three or four room mates 

374.86 375.76 B: right 

375.40 377.69 A: because the cost of living is too much 

378.29 380.05 B: right that's tough 

380.06 380.70 A: (( mm )) 

380.82 388.94 B: that's that that is tough i've worked with some women at a shelter and trying to turn their lives around and then trying to work with them with their finances and 

388.96 400.45 B: introducing the concept of putting a budget together and kind of planning your expenditures and they'd get very discouraged because it we'd say okay realistically what type of wage do you expect to earn 

400.83 408.55 B: you know an and they probably could find jobs that are around seven dollars an hour but even at seven dollars an hour at forty hours a week less 

408.74 420.06 B: taxes less any kind of ah health care premium if any less any garnishments [laughter] they might have and then just deducting the rent what's left over 

419.90 420.97 A: mhm 

420.88 426.27 B: let alone how am i getting to work what am i wearing what am i eating am i having a phone [laughter] 

426.93 428.09 B: am i heating 

428.27 430.21 B: it is it is very difficult 

431.12 431.91 A: right 

434.04 444.06 B: i don't know what the solution is there has to be minimum wage jobs but on the other hand i guess what it does is it kinda stratifies our society 

444.07 453.86 B: the there's the people that work at those jobs whether it's a teenager or somebody struggling for another reason or the people that have had the opportunities for other education or training 

453.94 456.75 B: that work at better jobs better paying jobs uh-huh 

457.23 471.18 A: they said um with the economy being so bad i saw on the news the other day that summer jobs that typically teenagers get like working at amusement parks um those kind of summer seasonal jobs that they don't expect as many to be open for teenagers 

471.13 479.31 A: because the economy's so bad that these are jobs that skilled adults who have training are going to take because they need the money 

478.57 480.57 B: they need something that's right 

479.62 480.46 A: right 

480.49 491.48 A: so you know we have people who you know in the past may've worked you know in the technology field are now working at magic mountain for minimum wage 

486.73 487.67 B: right 

492.95 495.89 A: because they need the they need the job 

493.23 494.31 B: that's true 

496.00 497.07 B: that's true 

498.31 504.31 B: and i g- think that's true for anyone would that probably would take a minimum wage job if if they need the job 

504.06 504.99 A: right 

504.81 506.64 B: and something's better than nothing 

506.51 507.31 A: right 

507.80 514.21 B: if you could find a minimum j- wage job that had any kind of benefits along with it i bet that's rare 

514.36 523.59 A: maybe that would be the thing is that if we left minimum wage at a at a low amount but st- you know maybe encouraged employers or gave them tax breaks or 

514.45 515.30 B: um 

523.59 533.03 A: or government subsidized benefits so that people who are on minimum wage also got maybe a health plan 'cause people who work for minimum wage don't have that 

532.92 540.33 B: right well or you could band small employers together to where they were a larger like voting or a buying block 

540.38 541.25 A: right 

540.52 545.08 B: to to band together to um do health insurance together 

543.78 544.79 A: mhm 

545.18 553.16 B: as a you know association of some type so that they could offer it at a reasonable rate i think most people would like to offer it at the but the rate is too high 

553.18 554.55 B: it's too much money 

553.31 554.33 A: right 

554.35 564.60 A: right 'cause i work um for a university and while my pay is less than a private sector job would be um it's the benefits that make it worthwhile 

564.48 565.43 B: right 

564.99 568.07 A: so if maybe they offered that to people who were 

568.23 569.65 A: for minimum wage 

570.64 574.43 B: right i mean because you could make something that will earn a little more an hour but 

574.68 578.45 B: you know if you found a job that paid a little bit less that had greater benefits 

578.50 584.42 B: and if you've ah put a value to those even a dollar value you'd i think find you were coming out ahead 

584.18 585.15 A: right 

586.18 591.40 B: but it is hard when you're struggling with the rent and the everything else that you need the cash for 

586.24 587.03 A: right 

593.26 596.72 B: so i don't know what the s- the solution is 

597.12 599.90 A: yeah it's difficult 'cause really someone's gonna lose
