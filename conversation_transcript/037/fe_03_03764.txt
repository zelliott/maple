39.39 52.58 B: no i mean it's basically with taxes and everything taken out you might as well be saying that you're working for four seventy five an hour and what's that i mean that's what i'm saying that's that's like you know meager wages that's it's not even 

52.69 64.33 B: you know it's it's not even it's unheard of you know are you supposed to you know live off of that or i don't know what they expect you to uh do or comprehend by you know by doing that

78.04 86.64 B: well out here in california it's it's terrible out here i mean even they when they raised it up to six seventy five or close to seven it's not even enough because

97.16 100.00 B: that's i mean it's not it's not enough money i mean 

99.97 109.28 B: another part of town santa monica they raised it up to ten dollars an hour which is decent because the cost of living in that particular section of town is much more expensive 

109.21 116.75 B: supposedly to everybody else so everybody over there gets at least a minimum of nine ten dollars an hour just to start off with 

111.21 111.97 A: oh i 

112.27 113.15 A: (( see so )) 

115.38 121.03 A: do people do people try to who live in other areas get jobs there and then just commute 

121.02 131.54 B: i think so i think they do that but you know not everybody can like work in santa monica you know and everything else you know it's just like it's anybody else you know any you know it's like you know luck of the draw 

124.37 125.83 A: (( yeah )) 

131.37 141.09 B: you work in a in a section you know you work in one area and you live in another area but you know it's just basically it's the cost of living is so high i'm not saying that everybody else 

139.53 141.99 A: mhm 

141.00 153.81 B: you know but i guess they're saying everything else is um i can't believe it's much more expensive than beverly hills or or you know bel air or anything else i mean those are some pretty expensive areas and i worked in beverly hills at a particular store 

153.60 160.21 B: and they were paying me i kid you not seven dollars an hour i'm like and they refuse to give you a raise 

160.16 161.20 A: really 

160.35 166.66 B: you know yeah this was a and this was a um actually a popular cooking store called william sonoma 

166.55 169.52 A: oh yeah i know they wouldn't give you a raise 

167.52 168.72 B: (( yeah )) 

169.07 174.39 B: yes they did not give me i quit i mean i'd been there for i was there for about almost a good year 

174.20 186.64 B: and when review time came some people got raises some didn't and you know and they gave like really lame excuses so i'm like forget about it [laughter] but it's it's it's it's you know it's pretty bad even in retail 

174.72 175.95 A: (( [laughter] )) 

182.57 183.89 A: that's insane 

186.45 200.56 B: you know when you work in those big conglomerate chains it's like they just wanna give you you know a little piece of the money unless you're in management or doing something else and they give you something that's decent or livable but anybody else you know you gotta struggle 

200.22 204.45 A: oh yeah and the only way to get those jobs is by knowing the right people and 

204.40 217.88 B: yeah and it was just you know it was luck for me but it was just basically um as far as living i mean you know the thing bad what bad what part about it was is that when you work and you you know you you were promised 

217.90 224.71 B: at one point full time and you're working minimum is not as bad but if you work part time 

222.28 223.62 A: (( yeah )) 

224.75 230.36 B: then they cut back your hours or to switch it or fluctuate that's when it starts getting really bad 

230.24 231.17 A: (( yeah espec- )) 

230.52 233.36 B: so basically nothing was even said because 

233.26 238.09 B: even with minimum wage you're gonna still be they're gonna give you they they don't give you 

237.99 248.38 B: like set hours sometimes so basically that also hurts you financially if you're expecting so much money and then it cuts you back and then you know it's it's it's a very hard struggle 

248.91 252.42 A: oh i see so you mean sometimes they'll just change the schedule on you 

252.00 253.71 B: yeah 

253.05 258.03 A: oh that's insane like especially now with the economy just being horrible 

254.14 255.30 B: yeah and 

257.32 258.41 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

258.63 266.13 A: and it's i mean that's one thing i can never understand is you know the tax cuts and everything i know everyone's happy about that but 

265.28 266.44 B: mhm 

266.41 270.33 A: you know if we didn't have those cuts they could raise the minimum wage 

269.97 280.78 B: yeah they could i mean but basically just everything's so bad now with the economy and minimum wage i think it being at that five dollars and fifteen cents doesn't make any sense at all 

274.47 275.03 A: (( [mn] )) 

281.15 293.45 B: i mean it doesn't that i made not even you can't it's not even living we couldn't it's not even called living wages living wages is your day to day means i mean gas alone is almost two dollars now you know two 

292.50 294.00 A: oh yeah 

293.32 296.50 B: two bucks so you figure you're getting five bucks an hour 

296.51 301.21 B: you know if you work forty hours you know you're gonna be getting maybe close to three hundred 

301.12 312.81 B: and i mean that's per week or so and then you take out taxes so basically you have your expenses if you drive a car you have gas gas alone you wanna put in at least for a week at least a good twenty bucks 

312.35 313.59 A: (( yeah )) 

312.90 320.14 B: that i mean that everything adds up you know you have expenses i mean just your day to day living 

320.31 331.36 B: is like is not even is not even attainable you know and then you know you have people who you know who have jobs with the economy and everything can't afford to pay you so this is why they can't aff- want to pay you less and you know 

320.36 321.13 A: (( absolutely )) 

322.17 324.00 A: (( mm )) 

331.31 339.06 B: they kinda shuffle you around a bit so you know i think you know minimum wages for people i believe it's for 

339.16 347.29 B: you know who are in high school starting out or maybe somebody who has maybe some disabilities incapacities 

347.20 352.36 B: you know you know m- you know mentally challenged that maybe you know 

349.74 351.02 A: yeah 

352.26 357.75 B: wanna work do something and you know they al- they already have you know some sort of 

357.64 365.66 B: you know government assistance but they wanna have something else on the side to have some kind of money that's okay for them but for everybody else 

365.56 372.93 B: who is you know pretty educated you know well off or something or just trying to make it on their own a means to an end that sucks 

372.74 386.24 A: oh yes the the one thing i was thinking though is that in like the midwest and in uh some areas of the country i could possibly see it po- if you got that amount possibly you know you could live a better 

376.99 378.03 B: mhm 

383.66 384.48 B: yeah 

385.49 397.90 B: you can you can definitely can because there are places in the midwest in the country backwoods whatever you wanna call it that that is enough money for them because their economy and their cost of living 

397.79 400.71 B: is not you know as high 

400.44 401.34 A: yeah 

400.63 414.22 B: as our you know as some other places like new york you know california texas some of those places those are more highly metropolitan much more commercial everything is much more fast paced i mean there's much more technology if you know what i'm saying 

413.75 414.75 A: yeah 

414.13 423.38 B: so it's much more money much more economy much more expenditure than a quiet sleepy town that has a population of oh maybe what eight hundred 

423.56 435.92 B: you know and they pretty much wouldn't mind having a five dollar and fifteen cent hour you know because it's it's not a highly populated town they don't have all that drama as a bigger town and i think 

435.59 436.15 A: (( [mn] )) 

435.83 448.76 B: minimum wage should go accordingly to you know you know particular states higher you know the more cosmopolitan states like new york texas california you know the bigger the bigger states 

440.10 441.53 A: oh yeah absolutely [sigh] 

448.63 456.33 B: you know the ones that are you know you know have more have more money you know and you know have much more economy going should they should have it accordingly 

452.21 453.14 A: yeah 

456.25 460.42 A: so you think like a me- by the median income of each state 

458.96 469.50 B: yeah i believe yeah as i say but yeah pretty much i mean basically i can say this because santa monica there's everybody for instance in santa monica from rich to poor and everybody in betw- 

469.59 476.12 B: excuse me everybr- everybody in between that and you know you i mean they just stipulated ten bucks an hour 

476.85 479.26 B: what about lo- l._a. county what about 

479.11 483.45 B: ventura you know what about different counties i'm saying that because 

483.31 491.97 B: they have a higher cost of living than everybody else i mean i don't think so i think it should be acro- cut across the line california southern california northern california 

491.83 506.46 B: they have san francisco the bay area and all that that's pretty i mean that's a that's a different you know economic bracket and they they have their you know income also but it's not as much it's not so intensive as in southern california 

498.34 499.80 A: (( yeah )) 

506.30 518.40 B: you have your hollywood you have your beverly hills you have you know what i'm saying new york has its greenwich village brooklyn you know it has you have all your places over there you know and you i mean you guys you know you guys gonna be having 

518.29 530.45 B: you know much more expensive you have you know you have your status areas you have your more upper state new york you have you know a lot of areas of of high income so to put every- put 

531.17 534.19 B: everybody gets that same wage when 

534.32 540.93 B: you know things alone is so astronomically high i'm sure i've heard new york has low taxes or something or 

540.63 542.37 A: oh no we have high taxes 

541.74 543.90 B: you have high taxes but do you have something 

542.48 544.20 A: they just raised it 

544.23 552.51 B: yeah but that's what i'm saying you got everybody has pretty much you know everybody has their high economics i mean you pretty much have an average of a high and low 

552.28 564.55 B: and you know you have a lot of you know affluential people over there just like california does or even texas because those are big states i'm talking about big states that you know draw in a lot of money a lot of tourist countries 

559.59 561.37 A: (( mm )) 

564.40 570.32 B: like florida you know new york upstate new i mean things are if you know what i'm talking about they just have more
