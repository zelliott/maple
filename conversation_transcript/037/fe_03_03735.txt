0.07 1.27 A: (( hello )) 

0.95 2.26 B: (( hello )) 

1.90 3.91 A: hi my name's cassandra 

3.76 5.39 B: my name is arlene 

5.40 11.30 A: nice to meet you [laughter] so minimum wages are five fifteen 

6.57 8.44 B: nice to meet you too 

11.39 15.13 B: yeah i guess that's not too great but not too terrible 

15.03 16.17 A: wow 

17.11 19.30 A: i don't know how do you feel about that hm 

19.56 27.26 B: i'm not sure i think not many people can live too comfortably uh at a nice standard of living at such a low wage 

27.31 32.78 B: but it's not so terrible that people have to live in some terribly deprived state 

34.08 36.42 B: it all depends on where i think 

35.74 37.36 A: i guess so huh i 

37.88 39.82 A: i can imagine i 

39.89 42.91 A: [sigh] it just seems like it would be so hard 

43.86 47.02 A: five something an hour five fifteen an hour 

46.90 49.50 B: yeah it depends on the city though 

49.51 50.66 A: i think 

51.37 56.00 A: i thought it was like six seventy five here but still that's nothing 

56.30 57.77 B: (( really [noise] )) 

56.86 60.71 A: it's just i wonder how someone could survive off that little mhm 

60.41 67.97 B: well i think there are sustenance currently you can't keep your car you can't have many luxuries and you just but you can pay the rent 

68.44 70.32 B: in certain neighborhoods 

70.55 71.85 A: yeah 

71.56 74.67 B: that aren't necessarily really bad neighborhoods 

74.50 75.68 A: mhm 

76.46 77.84 A: (( i wonder )) 

78.47 80.72 B: years ago years ago 

80.90 85.67 B: i think something like five dollars was considered a junior executive wage 

85.85 89.73 A: yeah that's true and bread was like a nickel [laughter] 

88.91 95.57 B: yeah [laughter] and rent was maybe you know two hundred dolla- two hundred dollars a month [laughter] 

91.06 93.04 A: the cost of living is 

93.37 94.79 A: oh 

95.93 102.57 A: it's so high it just seems like everything's so expensive i mean rent is 

97.74 99.06 B: yeah 

103.43 111.88 A: outta control i mean my co workers are looking they cannot find a one bedroom for under twelve hundred a month 

112.45 118.96 B: one bedroom is a lot for where i am because you can't find a studio for less than twelve hundred a month 

118.89 121.10 A: god so expensive 

120.55 121.62 B: (( really )) 

122.44 123.68 A: i don't know 

122.81 127.02 B: really where people have to share maybe you know not live by themselves 

125.32 126.24 A: yeah 

127.04 127.94 A: (( ugh )) 

129.15 131.97 A: i know it's really tough but five 

133.04 134.52 A: something an hour 

135.14 138.76 A: i guess that would be po- that would definitely be poverty level 

138.80 141.55 A: i guess you couldn't really raise a family 

139.37 148.58 B: oh yeah yeah and i think people might be entitled to some kind of aid i mean they might be able to have medical help from the government and food stamps 

147.42 148.25 A: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

148.55 153.06 A: that's true they might be able to get low income housing too depending 

154.15 155.18 A: um 

155.35 156.31 A: (( yeah mhm that's )) 

155.38 162.41 B: yeah there's there's a lotta stuff down here where they indicate to people that they can um if they qualify by a low income 

162.55 166.34 B: they can live in housing that's the equivalent of other people's housing 

166.35 169.23 B: s- housing i don't know if the the units are as nice 

169.71 172.42 B: but they live in in 

172.90 182.16 B: n- nothing that's like substandard housing they live in nice buildings in nice areas just a very few apartments are designated for that 

181.93 185.47 A: good mm there's probably a huge waiting list 

185.13 189.47 B: yeah sometimes sometimes they're they're clamping up a lot though 

189.48 199.26 B: in los angeles here they're starting to build a whole lot of them and the landlords are beginning to be pressured by everybody so there is some availability now who knows how long it'll last though 

199.34 201.59 A: right huh 

202.18 206.99 A: yeah it's probably a tough time there's a lotta people out of work and 

208.03 212.67 B: i guess some people probably think it's excessive i mean god knows there are all kinds of people 

212.72 221.64 B: and they probably think that how will everybody afford that and businesses will go under and can you imagine i mean imagine thinking of the other point of view 

217.85 221.03 A: right it's the cost of more yeah 

221.89 227.72 A: right the employers have a hard time paying the wages especially if there's benefits 

227.81 241.14 B: yeah so many business i mean like american airlines just recently i purchased a ticket and then i wanted to change it when the war broke out and they were struggling so much they were making things really impossible i think businesses really find it difficult 

241.19 245.10 B: to maintain the standards that everybody would like them to maintain 

245.40 248.33 A: uh-huh especially small business owners 

248.94 251.17 A: i think it gets tough for them 

251.20 253.04 B: [noise] even the big ones complain 

253.14 255.70 A: yeah in this economy 

257.04 258.85 A: (( yeah it's really tough )) 

258.37 267.73 B: like i heard somewhere that maybe people who do reservation work make six fifty an hour and they're getting cuts or something like i don't know what percent but they're getting serious cuts 

267.97 270.76 B: so how much above the minimum wage would they be 

272.37 273.67 A: right 

273.86 276.73 A: yeah if minimum wage is five fifteen mhm 

277.23 283.89 B: yeah and and that's that's about the lowest common denominator that people think it's acceptable somehow 

283.85 293.29 B: scientifically think it's acceptable in terms of the economy but there are many people that aren't getting too much more too much more and they have to they have to manage 

294.25 296.03 A: yeah they probably have to 

296.30 299.80 A: work a lot of hours just to 

301.18 302.92 A: (( keep food on the table )) 

301.62 306.80 B: (( [lipsmack] i guess that they have to compromise their lifestyle [noise] when they're young and they have to share all the time )) 

307.62 313.64 A: right and i think when you're young i mean i remember making like four twenty five an hour 

314.07 318.27 A: when i started working or maybe four dollars i don't know 

319.02 320.35 A: maybe it was less mhm 

319.37 329.02 B: and did it really bother you so much 'cause i i worked when i first got out of school i didn't even wanna work so i worked as a cashier in a movie house 

329.32 332.96 B: to sort of put of the inevitable falling into an office routine 

332.98 334.59 B: and it never bothered me 

334.95 340.79 A: [lipsmack] yeah i don't remember it bothering me at the time i mean i have so much more responsibilities now 

341.26 345.88 B: yeah so when you look back it's much harder to understand how people can manage but 

341.85 342.53 A: (( uh right )) 

345.87 357.39 B: it all depends on where somebody is in their life maybe and and how hard they think they're suffering or struggling or how they simply feel they're living and they're they're getting to a better place 

357.63 359.47 A: yeah 

359.93 361.21 A: (( yeah i could probably g- )) 

360.32 365.22 B: it's supposed to be a security net it's supposed to be enough but i don't really understand it 

365.25 367.85 A: yeah huh 

369.06 376.30 A: yeah i mean there's a lot of things i purchase i could do without i mean it just probably comes to just budgeting and 

377.63 379.80 A: and i think it's just hard 

379.27 386.89 B: and i wonder what the increments are like fifteen more cents over five dollars and what in in three years they'll be another twenty five cents or something 

386.81 387.84 A: right 

387.25 390.97 B: i mean what's what's everybody gonna do about all this anyway what can you do 

391.34 393.04 B: if you think it's too little 

393.86 394.88 A: (( [sigh] right )) 

394.05 396.95 B: or if you think that the increases are too gradual 

400.38 401.70 A: (( hm yeah )) 

403.14 404.35 A: (( i guess it sort of mhm mhm )) 

403.33 404.02 B: it's 

404.20 408.13 B: yeah it's it's hard it's hard to think of how to resolve these things [lipsmack] 

409.62 412.06 B: or what contribution you might make 

413.04 413.78 A: yeah 

413.08 424.68 B: or what what the problems are i mean if you actually decide to try to take it on you had to listen to somebody's professional point of view on the other side and then what what would you think 

427.72 429.55 A: mm on the employers' side 

429.13 431.06 B: yeah 

431.33 433.59 A: yeah they may just not 

433.79 438.33 A: i mean some employers just may not be able to afford anything more 

438.09 450.97 A: i mean they may wanna give their people more and just can't do it [sigh] but then most places i mean like all the fast food chains they automatically start at minimum wage and certain positions are just going to 

450.69 458.94 B: sometimes they don't even get anything more ever either i mean people work at that and maybe one person out of 

454.67 455.30 A: (( [noise] hm )) 

459.12 463.28 B: twenty five becomes management level and it's not much higher 

463.76 468.56 A: [sigh] yeah and i know some states like my cousin works in arkansas 

468.75 476.84 A: and she was getting like two dollars an hour as a waitress because i guess they can pay less if you're working at a job where you have tips 

476.52 477.36 B: oh 

477.46 479.06 A: [sigh] so she 

478.28 479.69 B: oh that is scary 

479.42 486.17 A: yeah i mean the cost of living is so cheap she says so she was able to get by but it's just amazing mhm 

487.64 493.16 B: sometimes even luxury venues like i went to las vegas a while ago and i like to talk to people 

493.22 497.12 B: and they said that everybody who works in the casinos 

497.24 504.20 B: the drink people the croupiers everybody makes the minimum wage and they depend on the tips 

504.42 505.31 A: (( yeah mhm mhm )) 

504.58 507.41 B: and some places tip much much more 

508.24 514.53 B: and they just said which one like i think um [lipsmack] hard rock cafe is a generous place 

515.23 518.92 B: but the moderate um inexpensively 

519.53 524.86 B: priced hotels where you can always get rooms for about thirty to sixty dollars 

525.34 526.60 B: don't tip them 

526.95 530.02 B: and they live all their lives on the minimum wage 

528.64 530.25 A: (( [noise] mhm oh my goodness )) 

530.17 531.71 B: it never changes 

531.54 532.48 A: (( right mhm )) 

531.82 534.43 B: they don't get more because of experience 

535.77 536.98 A: wow 

536.71 538.37 B: yeah [laughter] 

539.05 539.86 A: (( i know mm )) 

539.15 546.85 B: so there are all kinds of of ways of functioning a lot of people think it works and it just it goes on like that 

546.41 548.46 A: i guess they make it work i don't know 

548.75 550.20 B: waitresses too 

550.47 553.19 A: yeah they really depend on tips 

553.05 562.12 B: yeah but sometimes those tips aren't really that generous and employers will never give them as long as they live anything more than the minimum wage 

555.90 556.81 A: yeah 

560.15 560.90 A: (( mm )) 

562.67 564.08 A: yeah 

564.16 570.41 B: and the increases to them are are substantial i mean they think that it's it's sufficient [lipsmack] 

571.74 576.02 A: mhm [lipsmack] yeah [sigh] i always think about it when i'm tipping 

576.66 579.56 A: i always try to be generous with it but 

579.75 583.32 A: can i think that's what they're really living off that is the tips 

584.73 599.31 B: i guess but a lot of times those don't come in and and nobody um nobody makes any effort to say well after three years you'll get more after five years you'll get more that never happens and i think there are lots of jobs all over the country 

599.25 599.95 B: like that 

599.28 599.89 A: (( mm mhm mhm ))
