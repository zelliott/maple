1.37 2.65 B: hey 

2.53 3.58 A: hi 

3.27 4.56 B: i'm j._j. 

4.45 6.63 A: hi i'm samantha nice to meet you 

6.33 8.08 B: good to meet you samantha 

8.15 9.16 A: okay 

9.12 11.53 B: what do you think about this comedy thing 

9.35 10.04 A: (( um )) 

11.58 12.66 A: um 

13.02 15.42 A: well i think that um comedy 

15.43 20.65 A: can be uh something that makes people feel comfortable or it can make people feel really uncomfortable 

20.62 21.84 B: definitely 

21.72 22.82 A: i think it 

22.99 28.68 A: depends on i guess your sense of standards and um 

29.12 33.25 A: maybe what your background is or what your experiences have been with other people 

33.18 36.47 B: mhm oh definitely definitely i mean i think what 

36.76 40.74 B: you know might be funny to me might be offensive to you 

40.76 41.82 A: right 

41.28 42.67 B: (( you know so )) 

43.66 48.85 B: do you think that there's some things that are just universally offensive 

49.51 50.84 B: in comedy mhm 

49.71 50.65 A: (( i feel )) 

51.13 52.50 A: (( oh sorry )) 

53.03 56.61 A: i feel like there are certain taboos but 

56.83 63.57 A: they like you know like sex and sometimes certain kinds of like ethnic jokes but it depends on 

63.82 70.65 A: who like it depends on the context 'cause some people will think that certain things are okay and certain things aren't 

66.11 66.99 B: right 

70.87 73.23 A: (( but i don't know )) 

73.76 82.65 A: it seems like like there's always been like certain kinds of humor in different places like potty humor or something like that or like three stooges 

80.83 82.38 B: right right right 

83.28 86.74 A: seems to be pervasive i don't know 

87.03 89.46 B: (( that's true i guess it kind of uh )) 

90.27 92.14 A: yeah 

90.32 95.46 B: [lipsmack] uh yeah it depends on who you are and where you are and what age you are and 

94.82 96.95 A: (( yeah )) 

95.49 97.54 B: you know what what's your 

100.67 104.26 B: (( [sigh] i guess your background is and so forth and )) 

102.57 106.97 A: mhm and also if you're a man or a woman i think that makes a difference too 

107.20 112.28 A: like they say that like men find the three stooges more funny than most women do 

112.09 115.24 B: oh gosh i think that's the most disgusting show 

114.63 122.30 A: yeah i've never understood it like uh my mom and i were talking about this i've never really gotten it i think it just looks painful but like 

122.33 124.93 A: a lot of men really like that so [laughter] 

123.79 126.56 B: oh yeah oh yeah yeah it's just like 

126.89 128.91 B: oh yeah that kinda 

129.48 133.97 B: slapstick and and that sort of thing just doesn't really 

131.11 132.46 A: yeah 

133.99 141.21 B: um any of those sensible comedy doesn't appeal to me as much i don't know if that's universal among women or not but um um 

137.54 138.46 A: mhm 

140.64 142.58 A: mhm 

143.31 144.48 A: (( that's true )) 

143.49 144.47 B: yeah 

144.59 146.77 B: (( that's right you're right trying )) 

146.27 148.08 A: [laughter] 

148.43 158.89 B: to uh [lipsmack] um [mn] it's kinda funny that this particular topic came up right now uh because i had some relative visiting um earlier this week 

158.46 159.42 A: uh-huh 

159.35 164.70 B: and my brother in law kept telling joke after joke after joke 

164.38 165.33 A: uh-huh 

164.84 166.75 B: none of 'em were funny 

166.43 170.07 A: oh no and then that makes people feel bad or uncomfortable 

167.24 168.17 B: i mean 

169.69 172.57 B: yeah i mean it was like they weren't offensive 

172.65 174.59 A: mhm 

173.02 177.84 B: they weren't incredibly stu- he's a very intelligent guy 

177.76 178.58 A: right 

177.90 187.23 B: um but it was just like he'd got through this long set up you know with this this long story then it's just like ha ha ha ha you know just like 

181.93 183.29 A: [laughter] 

187.60 193.14 B: [lipsmack] well no they didn't appeal to either my husband or myself so i c- i basically i said um 

193.35 207.55 B: i'm gonna find you the best joke book on the internet and send it to you [laughter] and he was like if you weren't a lady i would send you uh my book of limericks but uh i guess they were uh very off color so it was like 

195.79 197.69 A: [laughter] 

202.48 203.82 A: oh my goodness 

206.46 208.58 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

207.71 213.23 B: i'm not gonna do that he said some of them were really funny but they are uh you know adult or whatever 

213.07 219.54 A: yeah that's yeah 'cause i hate that when someone's trying to be funny and they're not and then you feel bad for them [laughter] 

213.40 214.24 B: (( so )) 

219.17 221.80 B: yeah you really you really do it's 

222.67 229.84 A: some people don't but i really do i really feel bad when someone is trying and they're just not [laughter] 

225.01 227.01 B: (( oh yeah oh yeah )) 

228.56 229.48 B: (( i know )) 

230.10 235.94 B: yeah this sit- situation wasn't as painful as some that i've witnessed but 

230.10 230.78 A: (( but uh )) 

235.84 236.83 A: [laughter] 

236.16 238.22 B: still you know it was just like 

238.25 251.20 B: how could he come up with joke after joke after joke that none of 'em were that funny you know it's kinda like statistically you would have thought sooner or later [laughter] he would have come up with something that was actually funny so 

244.46 246.29 A: yeah 

248.78 250.60 A: (( yeah )) 

251.41 252.16 B: (( [noise] )) 

252.11 265.92 A: i think sometimes people use humor like um [lipsmack] you know like whenever there's you know like something going on like anything no matter what it is there'll be like a joke about it you know even if it's something really terrible there'll be a joke about it 

264.46 267.00 B: right right right right 

266.13 271.25 A: so i guess it's something people use to deal with stuff when they're uncomfortable but 

271.77 275.09 A: it's very individual even though you know 

275.11 282.75 A: people try to you know like make it universal like i think that there's a certain i think that there is i think there's like a certain 

282.81 286.79 A: boundary that most people will fit into but then i think that 

287.03 290.94 A: it it just varies so much too i don't know 

291.39 292.85 A: it's real interesting 

292.46 295.41 B: yeah yeah it really is it really is i mean 

295.86 301.96 B: during that same visit from my brother in law we got talking about seinfeld television show 

300.76 301.68 A: mhm 

302.13 305.20 B: which i think is absolutely hysterical 

303.67 306.41 A: yeah yeah 

305.64 313.72 B: you know i mean um of course every episode is not gonna be uh you know an emmy award winner but on the whole i thought it was very funny 

313.11 314.64 A: yeah 

313.91 328.58 B: and this this brother in law that couldn't couldn't come up with a funny joke didn't think it was that great of a show either [laughter] so maybe maybe we just had a real big difference in our humor styles or something there [noise] so um yeah 

320.05 321.32 A: really 

324.49 326.35 A: yeah 

328.57 331.27 A: yeah i thought it was hysterical i don't know 

330.48 336.40 B: i did too um but on the other hand you know talking about where kinda people kinda draw their lines in humor 

336.37 338.11 A: mhm 

336.50 350.58 B: my mother does not think it was funny because you know they would mention sex and things like that and so she did not like you know the some of the topics that they delved into so that 

343.76 345.54 A: mhm 

349.35 353.13 A: that's true yeah they really did 'cause it was very much like a very 

353.20 363.54 A: like city urban like in your thirties single sex jokes like it it sort of like embellishes a certain lifestyle 

363.45 364.78 B: right right 

364.09 368.85 A: and i could see that as being alienating too like friends was kinda like that too 

368.55 370.17 B: mhm mhm 

369.46 381.38 A: i rem- i remember seeing that and at one point i was thinking like god these like these people are all like i don't know i just it it's funny 'cause it's fun to watch but i was like i don't think i'd want their lives [laughter] 

381.26 383.38 B: (( oh no no mm mm )) 

381.90 382.92 A: you know 

383.38 385.39 A: (( it was like i don't know )) 

385.71 386.92 A: (( it was just funny )) 

386.93 387.79 A: but 

388.38 389.30 A: let's see 

390.17 392.51 A: (( what else about comedy [laughter] )) 

392.52 396.02 A: have you ever been to one of those like um comedy shows 

395.65 401.23 B: [laughter] yeah yeah i have i have which was that was pretty fun that was pretty fun [noise] 

399.91 406.53 A: yeah like i think there's a lo- something about being um like in the audience and having it live that helps 

406.32 407.78 B: mhm 

407.18 413.26 A: 'cause i mean i can watch 'em on t._v. and like i don't usually like them but my stepfather puts them on a lot but um 

413.77 418.99 A: like there's something i think about being there and being closer to the audience that i think makes it 

419.10 427.12 A: funnier or or then again it can also make it more painful if they're not funny but i i really i haven't done that very often but when i did go i did like that 

427.32 428.27 A: so 

427.55 430.52 B: yeah i did too and i think one thing that um 

431.03 434.41 B: made it kinda makes it more fun is um 

434.44 439.31 B: [lipsmack] when i went the comedian like drew the audience into it 

438.68 440.69 A: mhm 

439.34 450.39 B: you know and the time i was there was like a group of women i worked with and you know he kinda drew us into it and kinda made us you know like the butt of a joke which i thought was funny like you know 

443.60 444.79 A: mhm 

448.30 450.09 A: mhm 

450.33 459.09 B: what are you all do and we tried to explain what we did and he was like oh yeah right you really write it up and that you know operation or whatever and 

458.20 459.39 A: mhm 

459.19 464.24 B: (( you know those sorts of things so i guess some people would have been offended by that but we weren't )) 

464.37 465.91 A: (( [laughter] i )) 

464.72 468.39 B: (( you know a little embarrassed but mostly laughing you know so )) 

468.48 473.36 A: yeah 'cause i guess we- if it's a good comedian he or she can like 

473.42 478.98 A: read the audience and figure out maybe what their boundaries are too or 

477.71 479.52 B: right right mhm 

479.07 486.20 A: you know which again goes back to the idea of like figuring out what's what people are going to find funny and what they're not 

486.65 487.57 A: (( so )) 

488.09 488.98 A: (( yeah )) 

488.61 490.18 B: (( [noise] [noise] definitely definitely )) 

490.11 501.05 A: it's funny i don't know but it's also like one of those things where you can't always predict like if it's gonna be funny or not because like even the best comedians still have like bad days 

501.03 503.56 B: that's true that's true and some um 

502.40 503.42 A: (( you know )) 

503.86 515.09 B: [noise] sometimes you know what one person thinks is really funny just isn't funny to somebody else and [noise] you know there's so many situations where you gotta be there 

510.73 511.62 A: right 

515.30 519.83 B: you know if you're if you're in a situation and something happens all the 

519.99 529.78 B: surrounding circumstances and the other people involved and so forth make it really funny but when you try to tell it you know sometimes those things just fall flat you 

525.24 526.04 A: mhm 

526.09 529.12 A: yeah 

529.65 531.84 A: it's just not funny at all 

529.81 530.59 B: (( know )) 

530.93 532.77 B: yeah yeah 

531.96 542.77 A: it's terrible that happens to me a lot and i try and make up for it you know by just making the story embellishing the story but it's like that the whole you had to be there thing i think that's 

534.82 535.78 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

543.11 544.31 A: perfect 

543.92 546.16 B: [noise] yeah yeah that's true 

544.33 545.27 A: (( i don't know )) 

546.40 548.54 A: 'cause you just you have to be there 

548.56 549.53 B: (( mhm [noise] right )) 

548.71 549.73 A: (( and )) 

549.78 562.24 A: i heard something else that when someone's like really laughing like they show in their eyes not just in like the bottom of their face like the like you can tell a fake smile by someone's eyes more and i think that's true 'cause i think when you're really like 

559.66 561.06 B: right right 

562.55 566.44 A: like laughing about something like just your whole body gets into it 

565.98 576.69 B: oh yeah i mean have you ever gotten into those like just uncontrollable laughter where you go- yeah well it is great unless you're in like you know in church or something 

567.26 567.92 A: (( mm )) 

570.60 572.87 A: yeah it's great 

576.17 581.75 A: (( [laughter] yeah in like a or in the office or something something like that we you just )) 

576.72 578.51 B: uh you know 

579.14 584.86 B: right right exact- you know you have your evaluation and get incredibly tickled or whatever so uh 

584.38 587.01 A: yeah that's the worst when you're like 

585.60 595.23 B: but that's yeah there is definitely a difference i think between you know a polite vow or polite laughter and then there's just genuine you couldn't hold it back if you tried you know 

594.52 599.89 A: yeah and i feel like it doesn't happen as much when you get older like i remember that happening when i was a kid 

597.66 598.51 B: mhm
