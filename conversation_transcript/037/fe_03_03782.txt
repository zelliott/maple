0.00 1.95 B: hi my name's uping 

2.45 3.59 A: hi 

3.65 5.27 A: (( uh my name's ecos )) 

5.25 12.32 B: hi yeah so um how do you think you draw the line between acceptable humor and something that's in bad taste 

12.19 16.74 A: um i think it's a line between uh where it's vulgar 

16.41 17.34 B: mhm 

16.90 22.46 A: where uh comedy becomes vulgar and insulting to people in general 

21.01 22.12 B: right 

22.29 33.66 B: um i think it's usually it depends on the individual watching it because i think people are different like toleration levels and what somebody might find is like funny or vulgar might be somebody's idea of like something that's acceptable 

28.20 30.04 A: mhm 

33.71 43.94 A: right or when it's uh people are y- you know making fun of another person and you know you feel like you have a relationship with that person or ties to defend that person 

43.61 57.00 B: oh that's good yeah if there's some like personal stake involved and also if it's like unnecessarily mean or somebody's like doing it purposely just to spite the person or just to get make like a joke at the person's expense that would be probably acceptable as well 

46.27 47.41 A: right 

56.96 64.70 A: right or overly excessive uh you know comedy even if it's funny but you take you take it too far 

64.31 65.56 B: mhm mhm 

65.76 66.63 A: uh 

68.34 70.34 A: not sure not sure 

69.20 70.19 B: uh 

70.69 74.85 B: well um have you seen any t._v. shows that you think verges on um 

74.90 78.03 B: unacceptable humor or examples or acceptable humor 

77.19 78.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

78.25 86.24 A: um well i i don't think so i think a lot of the stuff [noise] on t._v. has you know been primed and [noise] kind of set for 

86.32 93.99 A: um mature audience and you know they try not offend too many people of course like nowadays oh you know if you go back like ten years they 

87.41 88.75 B: mhm 

90.00 90.76 B: right 

94.35 101.05 A: like now they talk about like the difference between black people and white people the difference between girls and guys you know 

100.93 101.81 B: right 

101.14 106.01 A: and even like ten or fifteen years ago that kind of comedy was a little bit unacceptable you know 

105.55 106.51 B: mhm 

106.52 112.85 A: and uh now i don't know it it it changes s- society changes i guess you know what people consider 

112.65 118.42 B: i find it interesting though that some people think that like let's say racial stereotypes are sometimes unacceptable on t._v. 

118.28 120.00 A: mhm 

118.43 130.91 B: that let's say for instance shows about um [cough] let's say asian americans or black americans if they take on certain like stereotypes that actually say some things that are not very appropriate there are certain groups who will feel offended 

123.92 125.23 A: mhm 

128.31 129.61 A: right 

130.39 144.11 A: right and [noise] i think sometimes you know when you're when you're listening to comedy of something and you feel a little bit offended but you know it's in good humor then you you kind of let it go a little bit more than you would in in you know a normal 

141.26 142.16 B: right 

144.15 145.47 A: conversation 

144.88 146.23 B: yeah yeah 

147.23 148.15 A: um 

149.52 150.89 A: but 

152.71 153.63 A: (( you know )) 

154.85 155.77 A: (( um )) 

155.99 156.71 B: (( [laughter] )) 

156.54 157.46 A: huh 

159.78 162.41 B: oh let's see what else is there uh 

165.50 176.15 B: i guess the whole sort of maybe the difference there's actually a difference between if you have to actually see the show [cough] as in let's say it's a choice to see it or it's actually presented to you in a situation when you can't like confront it [cough] 

176.18 190.78 B: so for instance maybe like either if it was like an ad in like a common newspaper and you happen to see it it's not like you can actually control yourself looking at it so maybe at that point unacceptable like the standards that would be unacceptable is actually like raised a bit and it's easy for something to be unacceptable 

180.71 182.42 A: mhm 

190.68 192.37 A: right right 

193.50 194.76 A: yeah 

195.83 196.82 A: um 

198.46 199.38 B: (( oh )) 

199.46 201.93 B: any other opinions [laughter] 

201.41 215.97 A: uh um yeah i i think i don't know i think it's very true like y- you can't i don't know y- y it's it's weird how like you know when you're like you know when you're in a group or you know when you're even when you know it's in good fun 

215.73 216.86 B: mhm 

216.08 228.20 A: that you're willing to you know even let yourself be offended to to see the humor in it i mean you wouldn't make fun of yourself more than you you think is appropriate 

220.05 221.00 B: right 

222.96 223.81 B: mhm 

227.95 236.21 B: well is that because people try to fit in so i guess it's more like uh they wanna do it simply because they think that that's the only way they can connect to other people 

235.93 238.32 A: right yeah 

238.41 253.31 A: and uh at the same time you let yourself be changed in another person's you now eyes when you know like if you like if it if the comic is already stereotyping you in the first place and then you just go along with it in good fun then 

249.76 250.59 B: (( yeah right )) 

251.41 252.38 B: mhm 

253.55 258.32 A: you kind of like expand that stereotype you know even if you laugh at it 

258.27 259.06 B: right 

258.70 260.96 A: you know more people are just going to think the same 

260.78 273.02 B: mhm do you think people have an obligation to protect like other people from it let's see like you know if you think some things are bad do you have like an obligation to protect your room mates or people you know from like what you think is unacceptable humor 

272.89 283.23 A: no i think the opposite i think i mean if it's out there like very rarely on t._v. like you're gonna see like you know something very offensive come out come on 

282.32 283.22 B: mhm 

283.32 284.83 A: (( um um you know )) 

285.08 296.52 A: just like it's like acceptable for it used to be acceptable for a black comic to make fun of black people but not for a while comic yeah and now it's just like um 

291.40 292.51 B: right right 

296.67 303.02 A: uh you know you you see you see a lot of that on t._v. but you don't see much uh i don't know you don't see much 

303.19 312.56 A: uh serious happening otherwise like people try to stay away from that but even whatever little bit is there y- you like it's good for it to be out there so people know 

306.29 307.29 B: mhm 

312.57 317.72 A: you know what what other people think and you you don't really you shouldn't have to protect people 'cause 

314.99 315.83 B: right 

317.78 321.96 A: you know it's the real world that's how they're gonna have to deal with what people think of you you know 

321.37 328.38 B: right right but how does that go for like stuff that we think is like vulgar or like unacceptable in terms of like sexual humor and so on 

328.40 330.12 A: right uh 

330.36 333.23 A: well i mean it's it's 

333.62 343.14 A: a- a- at the same time where it may not be funny and and you think that it's wrong you know you can say that when when it's brought up you know or when when you hear it you can be like you know that's 

343.05 356.33 A: that's that's really not true and you know that's v- very offensive i can't believe they you know they said that or whatever and let your views be you know focused on that but and you know not laugh if it's you know it's something that's 

349.18 350.00 B: mhm 

356.56 358.62 A: that isn't funny really 

357.97 358.84 B: mhm 

358.40 372.54 A: you know you shouldn't be laughing and that makes a point as well you know when you don't laugh at something you know that that sends out a strong signal also that this is not something to be laughed at like if they're making fun of like like i saw something the other day like making fun of like gay people or lesbians you know 

364.92 365.83 B: mhm 

372.13 372.97 B: mhm 

372.78 377.92 A: and uh it was just it w- wasn't funny at all you just you don't laugh at it you just 

378.82 380.32 A: keep that away 

379.97 381.24 B: (( yeah mhm mhm )) 

382.58 385.82 A: but i mean what do you think about that 

385.22 397.58 B: um i don't know i think it's really hard 'cause it's really hard to say you know i can judge for somebody else what i think the level of acceptability is but i guess there are like minimum standards like you said like i think like society should establish certain things that are like off balance 

391.59 393.23 A: mhm 

397.39 403.67 B: or maybe like even though there isn't enough of an outcry like you said like you know sometimes people not laughing or not reacting would be 

403.50 408.71 B: a good like way of responding negatively to it so like i feel like at the same time right it's like 

405.75 406.62 A: (( right )) 

408.53 418.87 B: maybe like the broadcasting stations or the t._v. serial writers the comedy writers should recognize that some things should be recognized as out of bounds and so on and not wait for like the markets to solve for it 

416.35 417.67 A: well 

418.73 425.44 A: right uh you mean and not wait for people to to find it unacceptable and then lose their ratings 

419.58 420.28 B: (( [cough] )) 

424.07 426.60 B: right and then reject it yeah 

426.22 436.88 A: yeah i mean i think it's it's weird because you know a lot of that they already have a lot of that like if you go i don't know i didn't realize how much they block on t._v. or how much they 

436.98 446.21 A: have stop- stopped blocking you know it's even like ten or fifteen years ago like if you go like cartoons especially like i found online uh 

438.98 440.38 B: really mhm 

446.61 450.56 A: somebody sent me a lincoln news explaining all the you know like 

450.71 456.70 A: you know com- comedy shows and cartoons and all the different shows where like how how they 

456.77 458.90 A: like have the original versions 

458.51 459.55 B: mhm 

458.99 466.47 A: you know and then it shows what the uh uh motion picture association or whatever had had cut out or asked them to change or 

465.73 467.00 B: (( mhm )) 

466.52 473.31 A: said it wouldn't be appropriate and a lot of times it was just little things or you know things in the background or not very important things and they just 

473.31 485.80 A: block it out they make they make them change it and some of the stuff seems really silly like uh one was like a batman cartoon where they have like you know they had to cut out the joker like looking at you know a girl a certain way 

485.43 487.07 B: oh really [laughter] 

485.85 496.37 A: yeah [laughter] [laughter] so it's i don't know it's kind of it's kind of interesting to see that they've you know that they've kind of blocked that stuff 

495.93 496.83 B: right 

496.40 511.15 A: and you know it's hard to see because it's not on t._v. you know it's not uh exposed to the mass public then it's hard for people to really understand what or how how they perceive what's bad and what's good how they perceive what's vulgar and 

510.52 511.73 B: (( right )) 

511.13 523.35 A: acceptable like if you see a comic or a comic all the time on t._v. making fun of black people or the differences between black and white people then you know you'll accept that 

523.54 536.71 A: you know or if it's the first time that you hear it you're gonna be like what i can't believe he'd say that you know even when they first start doing that like when chris rock came out well a while ago and you know he started doing that he was one of the first people to start doing that 

524.23 525.26 B: mhm 

526.63 527.56 B: yeah 

535.34 536.20 B: mhm 

536.51 539.52 A: (( and people were like wow can he being saying that you know )) 

539.18 540.39 B: right right 

539.84 545.35 A: and he got really popular for it and people's opinions changed i don't know 

542.95 543.79 B: mhm 

545.21 551.29 B: yeah i guess and i think it's pretty telling that like chris rock was isn't his like fan base among black people so 

551.03 560.27 A: yeah it used to be right and yeah and somehow that was the weird thing about it that like he was able to 

551.56 552.66 B: (( yeah )) 

560.07 562.64 A: make fun of the difference between black people and white people 

562.43 576.74 A: and make fun of black people in the process because he was black yeah and it felt more of like a a little family or group you know like a privatized group rather than mass public when he was you know up there doing 

566.55 567.74 B: mhm 

576.99 578.90 A: uh doing comedy 

578.53 581.12 B: right right right yeah i see that i guess 

581.58 583.39 A: (( right )) 

582.11 583.13 B: mhm 

584.45 585.32 A: (( so )) 

586.40 587.34 A: um 

591.68 593.53 A: trying to think of what else is 

593.09 594.09 B: [laughter] i know 

593.59 595.50 A: really vulgar to me you know 

595.12 596.94 B: (( uh let me see )) 

595.97 599.50 A: [laughter] because a lot of time you know if i hear something vulgar it's 

599.54 599.89 A: (( it ))
