3.51 5.61 A: um mine mine's patterson

6.33 7.38 A: hi 

6.94 7.84 B: hi 

7.96 11.60 A: (( i'm ah i'm in ah i'm in los angeles )) 

11.16 12.04 B: me too 

12.29 13.86 A: oh really [laughter] 

12.85 14.65 B: yeah what part of of l._a. are you [noise] 

14.46 17.52 A: ah near downtown like near mcarthur park 

16.99 18.87 B: oh okay i'm in the west side 

18.66 24.34 A: oh cool yeah i talked to somebody i did one of these calls today ah i talked to somebody in ah 

24.53 29.84 A: can't remember now like missouri or something this lady that was a school bus driver yeah 

27.00 27.95 B: oh really 

29.11 29.85 B: (( huh )) 

30.64 32.29 A: so um 

31.63 33.06 B: how'd you sign up for this 

33.20 38.38 A: on the ah on the internet i think i found it on craig's list or something i can't remember yeah yeah 

35.76 37.13 B: that's where i found it too 

37.26 38.86 B: yeah 

38.78 44.89 A: so ah cool yeah i don't know what's ah can you say about the the minimum wage it's too low right 

44.38 46.85 B: i think it's way too low you can't live off of it 

45.59 46.49 A: yeah 

47.33 53.06 B: 'cause if you do the math and work forty hours a week ah it's something what five hundred dollars a week 

47.42 48.48 A: 'cause if you 

53.07 60.52 A: no it would be like even less i think it's like would be like two two forty or i think forty hours at five dollars an hour would be like 

60.35 61.80 B: oh yeah 

61.03 66.66 A: you would be like two hundred and forty dollars a week and then with taxes you'd be bringing home like maybe two hundred dollars or something so 

62.68 63.50 B: but 

65.39 71.23 B: yeah you can't live off of that it's impossible even if you had two people in the household 

66.94 68.07 A: yeah 

68.30 69.13 A: but i 

70.42 75.31 A: and i guess with this thing i think the minimum wage in california is higher than what they were saying on the ah 

74.06 76.67 B: i think it's five seventy five 

75.96 84.44 A: yeah i think so but it's still i mean it's just like in the you know i can see where it c- you know it ought to be more here because of the the the ah exactly 

83.16 85.87 B: standard of living yeah 

85.80 98.93 A: but ah i can't think of any reason why it shouldn't be higher really 'cause it it's just ridiculous if you know somebody's working full time and they're still you know especially if you have a family or something then obviously like you're gonna be on like food stamps and all kind of 

99.18 100.28 A: um 

99.19 104.26 B: except for businesses that have to pay it out then they can't afford to stay in business 

104.35 107.00 B: if it's a small place like a family shop 

104.44 105.62 A: yeah 

105.70 111.07 A: i guess that's the yeah i mean that's the argument right is that they'll have ah or that they'll 

111.07 122.87 A: they won't be able to ha- you know have as many people working for them but still it's like you know it's like a job like that is just like you know for somebody that's that's it must like a teenager living at home that's like the only way i can think that it would be 

122.95 125.76 B: unless it's a second job or something or a side job 

123.16 124.06 A: (( you know )) 

124.38 135.31 A: yeah i think you know maybe it's all right but i mean the job i work at i get paid hourly and i don't you know i don't make a whole lot over minimum wage and it's ah you know it's not enough i make like nine bucks an hour 

135.68 138.86 A: and ah you know even that's like ah 

139.45 140.78 A: (( it's a pretty ah )) 

139.52 146.30 B: no minimum wage it doesn't matter if as long as you work full time you get benefits is that what the law is right now i don't even know 

144.57 153.71 A: well i i think so yeah but i think also that most places like try to you know they make a they make a real point of trying to keep people you know 

153.68 162.34 A: like places like wall mart and stuff you know they i was reading in the paper about you know it's like they have all all these people working for them but they're all like thirty nine hours a week you know 

162.24 163.74 B: oh to keep them under 

163.79 167.18 A: yeah i think they go i think a lot of places go out of their way to 

167.47 176.17 A: to not i don't know what exactly because yeah my job i don't i don't work full time and i don't get you know i don't get benefits i don't i don't really know what yeah 

173.81 174.86 B: you don't get 

174.92 177.28 B: how do have health insurance 

176.46 178.10 A: i don't have any yeah 

177.41 178.92 B: really 

178.22 180.04 A: (( yeah it's ah you know )) 

180.16 182.63 A: but i mean i'm young i'm like twenty nine so 

183.08 189.89 A: i haven't you know it's just kind of like a gamble that i'm taking it on not getting sick basically it's like you know i could buy it but it's just ah 

188.97 193.18 B: what do you do about yearly physicals 

192.65 203.46 A: well i don't really i don't really go to the doctor and then i just pay for it when i go to the dentist and ah you know i just i haven't i've been lucky i guess that i haven't gotten sick or whatever it hasn't come up and ah 

203.76 207.98 A: you know i looked into it once and it was like you know it's like two hundred bucks a month for 

208.31 210.77 A: for health insurance and that's just like 

209.35 212.49 B: [noise] so that'd be a fourth of your income if you were on minimum wage 

212.22 218.95 A: yeah basically it's like it's out of the question for somebody even somebody like me you know i'm making i guess what you know 

219.28 222.57 A: more than that but ah you know it's just so ex- 

222.79 227.99 A: it's you know it's close to what i pay for my rent and you know i have a room mate and we split the rent and so 

227.96 229.66 B: you pay two hundred dollars in rent 

228.19 229.24 A: (( this couldn't )) 

229.48 237.08 A: yeah well we're like you know we're living in a place and it's like ah you know a small one bedroom and we pay like you know five seventy five a month so 

236.39 237.82 B: that's amazing 

237.64 247.97 A: yeah i mean we got a really good deal and we're in a you know this is a real sketchy neighborhood over here you know where mcarthur park is right it's like the it's sort of like salvadoran neighborhood next to that ah so 

246.36 247.28 B: right 

248.13 250.35 A: that's why it's so cheap really but 

249.31 251.06 B: but still [laughter] 

250.43 252.41 A: yeah no it's a good deal 

252.84 254.40 A: [noise] but um 

254.84 268.92 A: yeah i don't know i mean i think and also like it seems to me like that it's it's like it's always on ah it always comes down to like a straight like democrat or republican thing too as far as like whenever you hear about it it's the democrat's who want to raise the minimum wage and the republicans that want to lower it or something 

268.89 272.66 B: well that would make sense on a political line i would think 

271.17 272.00 A: yeah 

272.53 279.49 A: yeah then that's you know i mean they're the ones like you know it's like congress or whatever who decides where the what it's gonna be so 

280.02 281.52 A: (( it's um )) 

282.00 289.48 A: i don't know i mean th- i think that's i think that's one of the issues though that makes the the republicans look really bad you know and like makes you want to 

290.11 299.59 A: be a democrat 'cause it's like who could like it's like the kind of people are making minimum wage like the idea of giving them another dollar an hour like i just can't i can't see like having more sympathy for ah 

299.52 305.66 A: a business owner than for somebody that's like [noise] obviously like making very little money anyway you know [noise] 

306.27 311.77 B: ah yes it depends on the business um might even need to be layers of minimum wage 

312.05 314.80 B: like in the food service industry 

312.36 313.77 A: (( yeah well )) 

316.05 322.85 A: [noise] well yeah 'cause they i mean like waitresses have like a or you know whatever have a separate you know there's a separate minimum wage if you're getting tips or whatever 

323.15 334.78 A: and then also like too if people are you know like different places should have you know obviously like it costs more to live in new york city and the minimum wage there needs to be like ten bucks an hour and if you're like living you know someplace 

334.54 339.79 A: (( out in the desert like maybe you really only do need six bucks an hour 'cause it's like the housing cost is so much lower )) 

341.44 344.85 A: but you think like different kinds of jobs should have different minimum wage like that [noise] 

344.91 347.35 B: (( maybe oh i don't know )) 

348.07 351.74 B: it doesn't seem fair but i guess it 

352.40 357.37 B: that it kind of works itself out anyway as ah you're gonna get paid more if you have more skills 

357.28 366.30 A: [noise] yeah [noise] yeah but that's the thing it's like the minimum wage jobs like who are those you know it's like teenagers like they're like fast food jobs or like you know just like 

365.25 368.08 B: retail don't you start out like all the mall jobs 

367.60 371.95 A: yeah i guess you do right i don't know i've never yeah it's it's like you know 

369.11 369.97 B: mhm 

372.63 378.39 A: [noise] [noise] that kind of stuff's like but you've gotta like 

373.17 373.96 B: (( oh )) 

378.49 384.48 A: you've gotta have sympathy for the like those kind of you know people that are in those kind of jobs and like [noise] 

385.33 386.28 A: you know 

386.65 395.17 A: i don't just like it seems like you'd have to be pretty like you'd have to be a pretty big to like not wanna give people like that more money 

396.32 405.72 B: yeah unless you're not making ends meet as a [noise] business owner ah like i'm just thinking of small places i'm not thinking of like bigger corporations 

401.22 402.21 A: yeah but 

405.81 408.20 A: yeah i guess that is like ah 

408.27 409.77 B: like mom and pop places 

408.73 415.91 A: yeah i mean it's true i mean there's a lot of there's people that run the franchises like somebody that owns a subway sandwich shop like their margins are already really 

416.03 425.72 A: low you know it's like they have to pay all this stuff to the the you know the franchise fees and like all the stuff to the company and like they're not you know they're not making that much money so it is like 

424.54 431.86 B: well aren't supermarket chains in hard times right now because of the unions that they have to pay their employees more and their profit margins are so minimal 

432.23 434.97 B: like safeway's not doing doing well 

432.40 441.39 A: yeah i'm sure i know like the the food fair last time they had it said people are all in a union and stuff i don't know how much more they make for being in a union but [cough] i'm sure it 

440.03 443.78 B: 'cause i know whole foods was getting boycotted 'cause they didn't have a union 

443.65 444.60 A: oh really 

444.24 445.16 B: mhm 

445.77 447.07 A: 'cause um 

447.47 454.62 A: yeah i don't know i mean i guess i mean i've never been in a union either but it's sort of like i always think that that being in a union means like you're making 

455.07 457.43 A: you're definitely making more than the minimum wage right if 

457.26 469.07 B: yeah well and then they're they're taking care of you to make sure that overtime is taken care of and that you're not like you said with the wall mart keeping you at thirty nine hours that you have the opportunity for benefits 

457.51 459.24 A: (( you get a unionized job )) 

468.09 469.01 A: yeah 

470.96 482.32 A: yeah i just ah i don't know i think i mean that's true but i just feel like i think that it's e- even if it comes down to like well then so then the sandwich shop or whatever like raises their prices you know what i mean it's kind of like if 

482.20 486.19 A: if minimum wage is higher it's like everybody has more you know it's like more money is in the 

486.41 492.19 A: is going into the economy or something or like it kind of makes sense to me like i almost don't mind [lipsmack] 

492.41 502.08 B: but then what if you're still making you got an increased minimum wage at the sandwich shop prices go up and then you can't afford to have a sandwich even though 'cause it spreads at the same level 

492.76 493.72 A: (( you know the e- )) 

500.43 511.58 A: yeah i mean i guess it all like it all comes around right in the end it kind of like affects inflation or whatever but yeah i guess it does kind of make sense i mean for my part like i don't mind paying a few cents more 

503.17 504.07 B: mhm 

511.54 518.17 A: you know for stuff that's you know that means that the people that are working there are making more money but yeah i guess it means they have to they also buy 

516.53 518.08 B: how do you determine that 

518.87 521.10 A: what i'm how much more i'm paying [cough] 

520.39 523.27 B: y- yeah and what they're what the employees are making 

523.75 530.44 A: i mean i don't know but i'm just saying like i would assume like if ah somebody you know if if somebody owned a sandwich shop right and the minimum wage went up 

529.91 531.00 B: mhm 

530.65 535.07 A: like and their alternatives would be either like to you know not they'd have to either 

535.08 543.78 A: you know fire somebody or you know have less people working there for less time or you know go out of business or raise their prices for their sandwiches so they're in 

543.86 547.45 A: you know if their prices go up a little bit 'cause the people that work there are 

548.09 549.65 A: are getting paid more like 

550.45 552.30 A: maybe that's not so bad you know 

553.68 555.77 B: so do you seek places out that 

555.94 556.78 B: do you 

556.86 560.52 B: like in and out i believe pays their employees more do you seek them out 

560.60 566.11 A: well i don't particularly but i have heard that about them it's supposed to be a really good place to work [noise] for 

566.16 570.87 A: um i mean i guess i was kind of suprised to learn that the people at my grocery store were getting 

571.61 572.61 A: um 

572.89 577.55 A: you know were ah were in a union and stuff but no i don't think it really like it doesn't really affect my like 

577.99 581.81 A: buying decisions i don't have any responsibility for it i think it's like 

581.27 582.78 B: i don't either maybe that's 

581.84 584.80 A: it's like a government issue you know it's like up to 

585.45 589.94 A: yeah it's up to like congress like sets the minimum wage for their for the country you know 

589.83 591.28 B: (( the federal minimum wage )) 

590.19 591.12 A: and then ah 

591.37 599.90 A: yeah and then other states or places like can have can make it higher but it seems like it's pretty much you think if that i mean
