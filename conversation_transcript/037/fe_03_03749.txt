105.73 106.81 A: and 

105.73 106.71 B: (( i know )) 

107.20 113.56 A: it's hard for people that are you know taking these you know piddly crappy jobs 

113.88 127.03 A: to make a living because they have been forced out because of the economy and everything and to to go from like a twenty dollar an hour job down to five whatever

139.50 140.61 B: oh i know 

142.43 145.88 A: when you think about teenage kids going out and working 

146.17 148.07 A: for the summer and everything 

148.15 149.35 A: (( um [sigh] )) 

149.65 154.90 A: if they made five fifteen an hour of course they can only work part time because of their age 

155.26 156.14 B: right 

155.28 165.85 A: they that's chump change i mean [laughter] they they can't even they can't even work towards buying a car or anything unless someone matches it you know or

175.13 176.21 B: (( no )) 

176.67 185.37 B: i'm i'm reading this book ah fast food nation and there was this statistic in it that if all the fast food companies raised 

185.34 196.18 B: um their waiters up by one dollar they would only need to increase the price of hamburgers or their burgers by two dollars two cents each and they'd be able to pay all their employees more 

196.27 199.45 B: and but they won't do it they kind of push down the wages i 

199.99 202.75 A: well see yeah that's just it you know um 

203.28 216.17 A: people are gonna start eating in more anyway because of the cost of food eating out i mean we buy pizza out ah or- you know have it ordered in once in a while and it costs so much 

210.71 211.56 B: (( know )) 

216.48 230.47 A: that you know thirty dollars bec- well for one thing there was we all three like different things [laughter] so we get different pizzas well then you [laughter] and then you know you got thirty forty dollars or whatever and then you think man i could've bought 

222.47 226.94 B: yeah oh no [laughter] oh 

230.25 232.24 A: two three meals for that 

231.93 238.94 B: i know i know i haven't been eating out at all any more because [laughter] the economy's so bad i i don't know i

256.34 269.85 A: she got sick and um i took her to the doctor and found out that she had a bacteria infection in her stomach that causes ulcers and that's caused from poor food handling is what the doctor told me 

259.29 260.33 B: (( oh god [mn] )) 

269.23 270.67 B: oh my god 

269.78 274.45 A: and i know it's from her eating out or even maybe even at school 

274.57 275.55 A: you know 

274.85 277.43 B: yeah yeah god 

275.63 282.11 A: because i worked in a school before and i know how some of the people handle the food up there 

282.41 288.74 B: ah yeah when i think about what i ate in high school i just wish i could take it back it's such poor quality 

285.61 286.48 A: (( i know ))

332.09 341.35 B: i'm kind of shy and ah i don't know the other one was very awkward but um you're very talkative so it's just a little bit easier which is really very awesome but um 

337.68 339.60 A: [laughter] 

340.29 347.87 A: i've done three my first one was with a girl in pennsylvania or some place and w- we hit it off really good

351.55 353.16 B: [mn] oh no 

352.34 357.26 A: and then ah like night before last i think it was i had i talked to a guy 

357.35 358.84 A: and even though 

359.11 362.62 A: we talked about a really great subject you know ah 

362.80 366.09 A: basketball you know i just love but um 

365.69 366.66 B: oh cool

373.29 378.42 A: you know stumbling all over myself trying to [laughter] to carry on a conversation with him 

376.12 377.38 B: [laughter] 

378.64 379.65 B: yeah 

378.65 383.00 A: but ah 'cause he wasn't real talkative either but ah 

381.28 382.49 B: yeah 

382.78 385.61 B: i know [laughter] it's hard [laughter] 

384.87 386.55 A: (( yeah ah )) 

386.87 389.71 A: so you're in where'd you say you were from 

389.22 391.62 B: los angeles yeah i just moved here 

390.09 394.99 A: los angeles so so ah are the jobs what're jobs like 

395.16 396.81 A: up there i mean as far as 

395.47 396.48 B: well 

397.17 408.92 B: i y- you know if you were my boyfriend hasn't been able to find a job out here and it pays a lot i was living in boston which is a more e- e- the cost of living there is a lot more expensive but my job paid about 

409.02 411.52 B: four thousand dollars more a year 

411.35 412.50 A: (( mhm )) 

412.25 414.58 B: and that's i'm doing pretty much the same 

415.37 416.64 A: i think it's i- 

415.39 416.97 B: (( thing but otherwise it's )) 

416.95 418.71 A: i think you know 

418.89 420.66 A: i don't know i just can't see 

421.95 430.71 A: [sigh] minimum wage if okay fit- five fifteen okay if you think about it most people pay five dollars an hour for a babysitter 

430.55 436.36 B: okay i know ow oh and that's so that's little i would think that most people pay is ten 

433.86 437.07 A: i know i mean that's what i'm saying that that is like on the 

437.90 440.83 A: the downside of average you know 

440.23 441.20 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

440.84 443.73 A: ah depending on where you're located and everything 

444.03 445.04 A: um 

445.13 454.21 A: i- if you had you know if a mother was to go out and get a job you know that's five fifteen an hour it wouldn't pay her to even go to work 

449.80 450.85 B: (( i know )) 

454.79 462.97 B: no so they ge- so she has to put her kid in a situation that maybe compromises the child because the the day care isn't of 

454.85 455.83 A: um 

463.84 464.62 B: (( you know )) 

464.15 466.13 A: well it would be actually 

466.51 470.77 A: to her benefit if she just stayed home and took in somebody else's kids 

468.80 469.77 B: (( yeah i know )) 

470.88 473.44 A: that you know had the higher paying jobs 

471.33 472.92 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

474.22 477.73 A: um i know my daughter when she's working 

474.32 475.28 B: yeah 

478.23 484.24 A: ah she makes about ten dollars an hour which for here that's a lot you know 

481.09 482.31 B: (( oh wow )) 

483.33 484.90 B: (( yeah that is a lot )) 

484.42 488.78 A: but then the type of work she does she d- has c._d._l. so she drives you know 

488.94 501.93 A: and but still she is a single mother and so she can't afford to pay day care so guess who gets stuck with the kids [laughter] you know it's usually me and i you know 

489.04 489.91 B: oh 

499.32 500.37 B: (( oh gee hard )) 

501.95 505.73 A: i love my grandkids and all but i wanna be their grandma i don't wanna be 

505.58 506.64 B: their mother yeah 

506.43 509.50 A: i don't wanna be the day care provider for them 

508.44 509.40 B: yeah 

510.26 511.48 A: so um 

510.66 512.22 B: (( oh that's really hard )) 

511.64 515.00 A: and i don't charge her but um 

516.25 527.45 A: that's only because i'm not working and then i feel like well i should be out working myself because with them being here then that's extra mouths to feed and that just puts us in a bearable aid 

521.67 522.92 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

527.51 528.54 A: you know 

528.55 529.59 A: um 

529.89 533.97 A: it's it's kinda like catch twenty two more or less 

533.02 535.12 B: it yeah it really is and 

534.47 539.16 A: i think the economy everywhere really is really sucks right now 

539.10 548.56 B: yeah it's really bad especially with mm with th- the fear factor that's going on at sars and the asian market they're just crashing 

548.53 552.33 A: yeah and f- for i don't know how this um 

552.64 555.50 A: how to even really talk about this topic 

556.24 561.45 A: because i don't know of anybody that that makes less than five fifteen an hour 

561.87 562.77 A: i mean 

561.90 562.84 B: yeah 

563.03 566.46 B: (( no me neither i just don't know anybody that does yeah )) 

564.08 565.53 A: unless like 

565.59 569.18 A: i don't know might be some restaurants or something where waitresses make 

569.28 571.63 A: less than that but then they get their tips 

569.56 570.86 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

571.87 572.93 B: yeah 

572.00 575.61 A: so and which that i too i think kinda 

576.50 577.41 A: kinda 

576.83 582.20 B: when i waited tables i made like it was something like two fifty an hour or something but 

581.49 582.49 A: right 

582.33 590.77 B: you never even really saw i never saw because it would've it would all go to taxes but you know i i would make a wad of money in tips so 

589.94 594.22 A: but see where i live it's a basically a college town 

594.41 595.71 B: right yeah 

594.44 599.95 A: and a a lot of college kids they don't tip you know i mean 'cause they're like 

598.36 599.89 B: oh yeah that's hard
