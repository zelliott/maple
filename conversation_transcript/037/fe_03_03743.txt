2.02 3.14 A: hello 

2.75 4.55 B: (( [noise] hello [mn] )) 

5.10 6.75 B: my my name is suty 

6.89 8.39 A: hi suty i'm norma 

8.12 9.66 B: hi norma [sigh] 

12.21 13.14 A: have you done 

12.25 14.01 B: and so where are you located 

13.82 16.07 A: i'm in washington how about you 

15.57 17.63 B: washington i'm in kansas 

17.25 18.30 A: okay 

18.90 21.15 B: so and how do you feel on the topic 

21.07 24.53 A: i don't think it's enough to survive on to tell you the truth 

24.12 25.16 B: [laughter] 

25.33 27.18 A: are we in agreement on this 

26.54 30.36 B: oh there's no way you can live on five dollars an hour that's true 

30.39 33.33 A: i'm i'm not sure how they should 

33.69 35.80 A: determine what it should be 

35.83 44.68 A: because the cost of living is so different in so many states but i know in my state there is no way anybody could survive on that amount 

44.52 45.45 B: uh-huh 

45.94 49.17 B: the only problem is when they raise the minimum raise 

49.49 55.28 B: that it raises the prices of everything such as the mcdonald's and all of the fast food places 

54.82 58.37 A: isn't that the truth do you have a suggestion of how they can fix that 

57.89 64.91 B: it makes it very difficult doesn't it and if they raise the minimum wage too much the teenagers can't get jobs because 

59.59 60.93 A: yes it does 

65.81 69.45 B: uh all of those places raise their you know everything up outta the way 

69.19 70.23 A: right 

70.15 72.20 B: um very difficult 

72.33 74.22 B: and should teenagers 

74.73 78.67 B: should minimum wage re- apply to the teenagers as well as to the 

79.12 80.44 B: family people 

80.62 83.84 A: well maybe they should have two separate minimum wages 

83.75 85.37 B: that might be a good idea 

84.07 93.83 A: for those those in school teenagers and then for families because i know my sister's only making minimum wage right now and if it weren't for the tips there's no way she could survive 

87.95 88.85 B: mhm 

93.61 94.48 B: uh-huh 

93.98 96.00 A: not raising her two boys 

95.90 98.07 B: oh my that's rough isn't it 

97.46 99.32 A: yes it's very rough 

98.64 99.52 B: uh-huh 

99.60 100.61 A: (( and it's works )) 

99.77 101.38 B: so she's a single mom 

101.40 106.37 A: well no she has a fiance right now but um he's just started back to work 

106.07 106.99 B: uh-huh 

106.52 109.80 A: so thank god that you know she's got somebody there to 

108.99 110.84 B: right but one person 

109.85 111.20 A: help her [sigh] 

110.92 118.44 B: trying to support even just themselves well my daughter makes ten dollars an hour trying to support herself and a baby and living at home 

113.42 114.35 A: oh yeah 

118.52 122.91 A: oh it's difficult on that i i i agree there one hundred percent 

122.17 123.11 B: uh-huh 

123.00 125.84 A: i haven't made minimum wage since i was probably 

126.89 127.81 A: twenty 

127.50 128.85 B: [laughter] 

128.04 129.93 A: twenty one years old [laughter] 

129.34 130.36 B: uh-huh 

130.30 135.00 A: i don't know how i did it back then but there is no way that my family and i could survive on it now 

134.66 136.50 B: it's very difficult 

136.90 140.79 B: yeah i [sigh] but minimum wage is supposed to be an entry level 

141.32 142.59 B: amount 

142.94 144.15 B: so 

144.25 149.76 B: is that supposed to be for someone that's sixteen seventeen eighteen years old just entering the workforce 

149.92 154.08 A: well now i would think that that would be okay i think that they can live on it 

153.99 159.56 A: at that age they're staying at home they're going to school you know they don't need it to support themselves basically 

159.14 160.07 B: right 

159.46 169.64 A: they they need it for extra curricular activities perhaps they're saving for a car or they're saving for college and i think in that instance living at home and not having the 

164.67 165.66 B: mhm 

170.31 176.14 A: responsibilities that single parent has that's why i'm thinking you know should there be two 

171.56 172.59 B: right 

173.09 174.49 B: right 

176.43 181.45 A: different levels should there be criteria for minimum minimum wage 

181.82 183.81 A: it boggles the mind 

183.08 189.52 B: it does boggle the mind because it's really difficult and you start raising that too much then everything else goes up so much 

189.98 190.83 B: that 

190.65 196.40 A: well i agree but i i do know that i- it's difficult to decide this 

191.65 192.95 B: it makes it 

197.68 199.21 A: simply because 

200.72 207.10 A: the cost of living in states is so different in the state that i'm living in right now because we've had everybody from california 

207.62 210.86 A: for all the high paying jobs and they have all the money so that they can 

210.92 215.33 A: purchase the houses and and basically the cost of living has gone up 

214.94 215.83 B: yes 

215.23 229.52 A: nobody could live on that minimum wage in this state however we're talking about moving to montana where the cost of living is half or less than what it is here and somebody could survive a little easier on that minimum wage 

218.59 219.48 B: mhm 

229.69 232.31 A: than they could in in my state in washington 

231.77 232.71 B: uh-huh 

232.41 240.74 A: so again it's it's one of those things that you can't set a criteria for the entire country or for the entire age group 

241.13 242.93 A: simply because it doesn't fit 

242.77 243.79 B: right 

243.84 246.20 B: but that's true of so many things 

246.51 253.71 B: i know my son collected social securi- or paid into social security at the wages in california and now he lives in texas 

254.27 258.09 B: and it doesn't seem quite fair because they're gonna get a lot more 

258.44 262.06 B: money and when they retire out from their social security than a lot of people 

262.30 265.45 B: because they m- paid so much higher out in california 

265.11 271.76 A: well but in california they would barely be able to survive on that thank god in texas they can right 

268.41 269.34 B: uh-huh 

270.32 274.22 B: right so now they're working in texas and being paid out of california 

274.69 276.75 B: so they've got the best of all worlds 

276.64 279.94 A: so what's the answer there there's just no good answer 

281.15 285.91 B: so should it be set by the states the minimum wage or should it be a national 

286.37 289.87 A: you know that's something that should be looked into i think that it should be 

289.77 292.79 B: i think the states need more more power 

291.11 294.23 A: well more regulation through the states i agree 

293.81 297.67 B: i i don't like having all the federal government having all the power 

297.43 300.37 A: well no because they don't 

300.46 303.72 A: take into consideration the differences in the states 

303.44 304.35 B: right 

304.28 309.24 A: that's that's very good i i never gave it that thought that the states maybe should regulate it [mn] 

309.91 313.56 B: yeah because if if each state had its own minimum wage 

313.96 317.70 A: but then again i i think that we should look into the age groups also 

317.23 324.17 B: oh i do too i do too because there's no reason for a fourteen year old to being paid eight dollars an hour 

325.08 328.28 B: um the same as a thirty year old should get paid 

327.15 329.98 A: and trying to survive on that that's correct 

329.50 336.94 B: right i mean a fourteen year old working at mcdonald's for three or four hours a a night three or four nights a week 

330.01 331.76 A: correct i agree 

337.09 344.39 B: is just doing it to buy gas for the car and and take a girl to you know to the movies on friday night 

339.27 340.53 A: exactly 

344.03 346.14 A: exactly what did they 

345.01 346.36 B: whereas a thirty year old yeah 

346.17 350.26 A: what did they say the minimum wage was i'm so woefully behind did he say it was 

350.19 353.88 B: i i thought it was five thirty five but i'm not sure 

350.30 351.52 A: five dollars 

353.45 358.77 A: i thought it was more than that i thought it was up in the six or seven dollar range oh see how far behind i've got 

357.78 359.56 B: oh no i don't think so 

359.97 360.88 A: oh well 

360.12 365.57 B: but you know i do think in some states that they do have it lot higher than than the minimum really is 

366.19 367.25 B: and uh 

367.27 368.02 A: well 

368.17 372.82 A: does that mean that there's states or uh excuse me a federal set 

373.41 375.94 B: i think the five thirty five is federal 

373.94 375.72 A: which would be the lowest 

375.93 380.04 A: that would be the lowest they could go and then the states have the the 

380.36 385.53 B: then i uh no i don't think the state has the the right to change it all but i think individual 

385.62 396.94 B: places like you know at mcdonald's and yeah and mcdonald's in washington state might pay seven dollars an hour to start where mcdonald's in kansas only pays five thirty five 

387.79 390.23 A: (( employment employers right )) 

397.80 398.86 B: and uh 

398.41 400.70 A: yeah i think that's true anywhere 

401.16 407.61 A: but i thought the minimum wage was higher than five thirty five i i suppose i could be wrong i'll need 

406.52 409.41 B: yeah well i'm on a salary so i have no idea 

409.48 410.44 A: (( t- right )) 

409.98 412.31 B: a very low salary to speak of but 

411.68 414.26 A: (( exactly [laughter] i know that feeling )) 

412.52 415.99 B: [laughter] i don't think i even get minimum wage b- 

415.44 417.74 A: oh no that can't be 

417.47 418.45 B: oh 

418.16 423.63 A: i i you couldn't work at a salaried job without at least making minimum wage oh my 

423.40 428.29 B: oh i'm sure i don't [laughter] but i work from home 

428.32 429.14 A: oh 

428.56 431.15 B: [mn] it's worth it to me to uh 

430.31 438.99 A: oh definitely see i'd get a job like that i would accept minimum wage if i could have a job where i knew that i was working at home yeah corporate 

431.84 433.21 B: but um 

438.17 439.05 B: right 

439.63 447.24 B: yeah i work at home and and keep my grandbabies at the same time so i don't care what the pay is i mean i do care i'm supporting the family on it but 

446.63 448.20 A: (( right but see )) 

447.37 450.58 B: but um well i've got my grandbabies too 

449.85 451.99 A: how many grandbabies do you watch 

451.60 452.59 B: uh two 

452.55 453.98 A: are you raising them 

453.92 458.80 B: no their parents both work in the daytime uh outside the home job so 

458.56 464.11 A: wonderful that you will do that but if you were raising those babies there's no way you could do it on minimum wage 

459.75 461.03 B: i get to keep the 

461.69 462.28 B: (( [cough] )) 

463.65 466.52 B: no no there's not then uh 

466.66 470.77 B: they're almost seventeen months old each of 'em so it's kinda fun 

471.28 474.62 B: but uh and their parents make a lot more than i do 

474.84 477.86 B: but i keep the babies for free for 'em so they can work 

477.64 479.39 A: see that's what a grandma's for 

478.54 480.08 B: raise their babies 

480.14 481.24 A: i can't wait 

480.21 485.92 B: but um yeah minimum wages are really hard hard thing to come across i mean i just don't know how you 

486.21 489.88 B: determine what it should be and what it shouldn't be 

490.68 495.54 A: well i think they should let us make the law make the rules don't you agree [laughter] 

495.15 496.78 B: well yeah of course 

497.10 502.03 B: i think we do don't we we vote the people into power that that do it so now what do we do about it 

502.07 506.67 A: exactly th- we get 'em in there and then they don't do what we thought they would 

502.22 503.06 B: [laughter] 

504.85 507.52 B: they don't do as we've tell 'em to at all do they 

506.95 508.54 A: (( exactly )) 

507.95 509.33 B: but um 

509.65 513.22 B: yeah i think but i do think the states need more more on that 

513.40 516.56 A: i agree i think it should be regulated by the states 

518.53 523.02 A: and i definitely think it should be higher than five fifteen or even five thirty five 

523.00 526.70 B: yeah i don't think it would hurt at all if they make it six or six fifty 

526.38 527.53 A: not at all 

526.92 532.77 B: but i do like the idea of having two different scales where it's but how would you determine i mean 

532.84 533.67 A: well 

532.95 538.07 B: would you have a sixteen year old that's supporting sixteen year old single girl with a baby [noise] 

539.34 541.67 A: well living on her own see that's for 

540.65 544.56 B: living on her own should she make minimum wage or should she make more 

544.76 547.53 A: y- you bring all of these different [sigh] 

548.36 560.51 A: all of these different criteria into it it makes it very difficult to decide because you're right because how many sixteen and seventeen year olds are there out there that are supporting themselves and maybe a child or even two 

552.83 553.88 B: it does 

560.34 561.59 B: mhm 

560.59 565.60 A: and and don't have help from parents don't don't have anybody else help 

564.82 566.99 B: although they do qualify for 

567.19 571.11 B: for um some kind of assistance from the government i think don't they 

568.10 569.83 A: aid to dependent children 

570.92 572.13 A: right they do 

571.91 573.62 B: well only for a couple of years 

572.25 574.49 A: and w- families with dependent children 

575.00 575.99 B: what was that 

576.06 578.66 A: aid to families with dependent children 

578.41 580.13 B: uh-huh or 

579.09 579.91 A: yes 

581.26 584.88 B: uh yeah i think it is aid to family yeah a._d._c. 

585.39 587.76 B: and uh and food stamps 

587.66 588.65 A: yes 

588.04 592.63 B: so i guess with minimum wage and that and then they also get their daycare paid if they 

592.45 593.50 A: yes 

593.22 594.97 B: yeah so there are 

595.75 599.89 B: i- if you're uh a girl or a guy with a with a child and needed
