93.13 103.15 A: i don't know i i sometimes when i hear humor that is uh in bad taste i i typically i don't respond to it 

103.35 114.82 A: uh that's typically how i draw the line at you know um usually my response would be a negative response to it so i just i typically i i won't say anything uh kind of um 

110.79 111.96 B: mhm 

115.63 119.21 A: uh just uh avoidance of it

125.18 127.08 A: right 

127.26 128.28 A: right 

127.28 130.66 B: yeah i would say the same about myself also but um 

130.79 140.15 B: also think it sort of depends on the context and also the sort of audience that that comedies are getting weaker 

141.66 142.71 B: yeah i mean 

142.82 151.17 B: i could be sitting at some place and uh listening to something and i might find it in bad taste but it might be meant for an audience 

151.37 153.90 B: were more conceptual to it or 

154.12 158.19 B: they meant to uh yeah and uh 

158.60 162.62 B: for myself like personally i i also 

163.84 168.00 B: just just draw blank at it and 

168.70 172.10 B: if if it's not to my particular taste 

168.72 169.80 A: yeah 

173.54 183.22 A: yeah yeah it's um you know if i'm if i'm at a comedy club or something and you know if it's part of the environment then 

183.12 184.06 B: mhm 

183.29 192.20 A: i mean it's a different context but if if it's something that's actually hurtful or harmful um i usually you know it's 

185.45 187.04 B: (( right )) 

192.57 198.28 A: i don't participate and usually that's a good communication to another person 

198.35 199.98 B: yeah 

198.41 201.58 A: that uh what is actually 

202.06 206.38 A: happening is is um you know just not appropriate so 

206.55 213.71 B: mhm yeah yeah and also sometimes it's important to see how much uh 

215.42 217.03 B: (( as far as the person who is )) 

217.85 222.97 B: (( doing the comedy or like presenting the joke or whatever it's the um )) 

223.02 226.16 B: what really is in his or her mind though 

226.60 230.81 B: are they doing it intentionally something hurtful or is it 

231.05 234.05 B: is it absolutely clear like innocuous or 

234.83 235.65 B: (( um )) 

235.83 246.60 B: (( yeah but just can be presented in a hurtful manner and probably that person is not fully aware of it and uh uh in that case i suppose )) 

247.03 248.86 B: they could be 

249.09 250.92 B: (( sort of forgiven or )) 

250.96 253.89 B: seen in a different light than as as 

254.29 257.43 B: a active aggressor or an active 

258.63 261.14 B: as somebody active in wanting to 

261.84 266.34 B: do this hurtful thing or say this hurtful thing right 

266.62 269.39 A: right yeah it's um 

269.73 272.00 A: yeah drawing the line with uh 

272.81 275.90 A: uh hurtful humor it's um 

276.21 277.69 A: you know i've i've i've 

277.78 282.58 A: instead of um being confrontational about it it it really is a 

282.70 288.76 A: you know for me it's it's um you know a matter of of you know really just walking away from it i don't 

288.92 292.02 A: and i i'm usually you know 

293.94 297.95 A: uh very uh clear about um 

298.44 302.48 A: you know uh whatever what the context is for 

301.73 303.59 B: (( mhm )) 

302.59 306.65 A: you know for the humor and and you know um 

307.55 309.59 A: whether or not it's um 

309.90 311.50 A: you know um 

311.31 324.37 A: an an appropriate context i i myself i write comedy i'm an actor and i'm a screenwriter and i so i write comedy and i'm real clear about [laughter] what 

319.96 321.71 B: mhm 

323.47 324.18 B: (( [noise] )) 

324.19 331.18 A: what is what is appropriate and what's not appropriate and you know timing of it i think that um 

332.27 345.47 A: you know typically you know um when it's most appropriate and the the time to draw a line is is when it you know uh the other it at another person's expense and they're vulnerable 

345.45 347.42 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

345.61 347.85 A: um and um 

348.16 350.07 A: so um 

350.64 354.29 A: i also uh am you know 

354.30 358.30 A: gay humor or uh ethnic humor 

358.31 367.67 A: or uh female humor or w- w- you know different types i mean i mean if you cut it all you'd you'd have no humor but there's 

366.01 368.62 B: (( mhm yes mhm mhm mhm [laughter] )) 

369.11 371.88 A: there's uh uh i think that um 

370.19 371.99 B: (( yeah )) 

372.65 375.91 A: you know there's there can be a a sense of compassion 

376.02 379.93 A: about another person in in their particular um 

377.81 379.16 B: (( that's [noise] )) 

379.32 380.85 B: (( yeah )) 

381.12 382.63 A: situation where 

382.99 387.75 A: the humor is not done by someone who hates a gay person 

387.33 388.84 B: mhm 

387.84 394.36 A: or hates uh someone with a diff- different ethnic background than themselves or who hates women 

392.61 393.93 B: mhm 

394.38 396.16 B: mhm 

394.59 408.73 A: so um you know when it happens like that then that's when i draw the line to bring it back to topic that's when i draw the line and i uh i do not participate and i i generally walk away 

408.78 410.57 B: (( right )) 

408.78 412.87 A: um from um from that particular situation 

413.04 416.77 A: in that i don't inv- involve myself in gossip 

417.16 426.31 A: um 'cause a lot of gossip is kind of geared along that line uh and that's that's where i draw the line i i don't engage in gossip because 

421.55 423.37 B: mhm 

426.33 430.41 A: a lot of times it's humor barbed with character assassination 

430.67 432.08 A: and um 

432.48 434.68 A: so that's where i draw the line 

435.41 439.35 B: (( oh i think the gossip part is interesting because )) 

440.93 441.97 B: (( uh )) 

442.45 448.68 B: (( uh i i i didn't know that i would think of it as being part of um )) 

449.09 451.00 B: the humor thing but uh 

451.14 454.40 B: i mean i find [noise] gossip as being 

454.66 460.13 B: something entertaining and uh that's why you are looking at it in the same 

460.70 462.84 B: (( same basket as humor )) 

464.75 465.74 A: gossip 

466.01 479.25 A: i think that some people engage in gossip and they they find it to be comedic and they find it to be humorous but it's generally at another person's expense so that's another instance where i draw the line with 

466.11 466.90 B: yes 

473.08 474.05 B: mhm 

479.26 486.09 A: uh communication or with um uh comedy that that goes over the line 

483.28 486.51 B: (( [noise] )) 

487.55 497.06 B: uh-huh mhm uh for me i i suppose i um [laughter] i like to gossip [laughter] but the thing is that uh 

497.58 503.56 B: (( that what is the effect of it is it really going to hurt be hurtful to the person whom i'm talking )) 

503.80 505.83 B: (( maybe in a )) 

506.46 521.30 B: at the cost of whom i'm having the gossip over so it's more like if i'm sitting down with a very close friend and uh we're just chatting about other people and i know it's more or less between us and um 

521.93 522.68 B: it 

523.33 528.28 B: it's not being it's not through some open public forum or something like that so 

528.27 541.00 B: um i think i would and i do [laughter] engage in that kind of kind of things and um but but yeah certainly i would at all times uh be 

541.42 543.56 B: be conscious 

543.74 544.73 B: of 

545.24 548.68 B: (( the b- b- b ill effects of my )) 

549.43 553.41 B: chatting and um whatever i say and um 

553.61 555.77 B: and e- e- even in 

555.92 559.70 B: the course of such such a conversation i would probably 

560.33 566.98 B: drop a line in ahead that well we probably shouldn't be talking about him or her in that way but 

567.29 570.93 B: (( i i mean it's it normally does not go into )) 

572.14 573.36 B: um 

573.68 575.69 B: an ac- acrimonious 

575.74 588.30 B: sort of approach but but i suppose my my line also shifts with my moods if [laughter] i am in a really bad mood i [laughter] might uh 

588.71 591.71 B: yeah i might take liberties but um 

592.14 593.38 B: (( but still i )) 

593.53 599.95 B: in that sort of a situation it becomes more a political correctness
