163.25 167.32 A: at least in minnesota they don't give you much assistance beyond that not unless you've 

167.64 170.33 A: got a ton of kids or you know 

170.52 172.20 A: disability or something 

171.99 182.37 B: yeah like the only real aid that i get is like student like i have like a scholarship and a loan so you know like after i get out i'll have to pay the loan back so it's really not that much of a help

201.67 209.51 A: i don't know [laughter] i remember when i was i mean a couple of years ago back here i wonder if different states have uh um 

202.80 203.70 B: yeah 

210.34 214.80 A: have the opportunity to change that because it does seem to me like um 

215.45 219.36 A: it was at least several years ago that they had raised the minimum wage here to 

219.42 220.46 A: like five 

220.50 222.68 A: fifty five or something an hour and that was i 

222.86 225.41 A: say at least a good four or five years ago 

225.24 226.16 B: yeah 

225.55 229.29 A: i wonder if like states can raise it beyond that 

229.72 235.97 B: yeah i don't i don't really know i mean i just remember like when i was still in high school they were talking about raising it to like six 

235.98 241.79 B: dollars and back then i was like hoo that's so much but now it's like and now its like nothing 

236.18 237.12 A: yeah 

238.65 240.67 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

241.88 242.97 A: (( right ))

273.78 274.54 A: (( [sigh] )) 

274.92 277.01 A: i just can't even imagine and i know 

277.18 281.46 A: the fact that this minimum wage is supposed to go up isn't gonna raise their minimum wage at all 

281.75 282.63 A: so 

283.18 290.37 B: [noise] yeah well three fifty for bartending is pretty good 'cause i waitressed for a while like about a year ago i made like two eighty

490.09 492.57 A: (( see you're supposed to talk mostly about the topic but )) 

492.39 500.18 B: yeah i just wonder like if they raise the minimum wage would that like increase other things like 

500.47 504.83 B: [mn] since it's five fifteen now or whatever like if they raised it to like maybe 

503.07 503.92 A: mhm 

504.84 506.64 B: i don't know like fifteen 

506.75 513.95 B: i guess would that would the fifteen become like the new five or would the fifteen be any good 

507.05 508.03 A: mhm 

513.96 514.92 B: or 

514.73 515.97 A: yeah 

516.30 518.68 A: well i know our you know when we 

518.78 524.71 A: get the cost of living raises at through our jobs it goes up twenty five cents an hour 

522.16 523.11 B: mhm 

524.30 525.32 B: oh wow 

525.26 526.81 A: and that's once a year 

526.46 527.42 B: mhm 

527.02 529.44 A: and how often i mean i know they don't raise 

529.56 531.84 A: minimum wage that much that often 

531.52 532.63 B: yeah 

532.52 539.05 A: and and i know our cost of living barely keeps up with inflation and what's going on so 

538.36 539.23 B: mhm 

539.62 543.37 A: yeah i wonder if it would really make an- a a huge difference in raising it 

543.48 544.43 B: yeah 

546.19 547.18 A: (( i don't know )) 

551.56 553.73 A: to me it's amazing because 

556.47 560.27 A: taxes are going up about the same you know you wonder how much 

560.85 565.00 A: all it's basically doing is keeping your head above water anyhow 

564.74 565.69 B: (( [mn] yes )) 

567.73 582.09 B: yeah i don't know how like like in philadelphia the tax like the local tax is just it's it's i don't even know like what percentage but it is so high it's insane i just i like get my pay check and i'm just like oh my gosh 

572.81 573.60 A: uh-huh 

582.08 582.96 A: wow 

582.53 584.91 B: but i use my parents' address

584.99 596.93 B: for like for um like my taxes like i give my my h- my home address which isn't philadelphia so like that kinda helps but then it's like i i need the money now i don't need it on in april [laughter] so 

589.74 590.63 A: okay 

596.34 598.27 A: right yeah 

597.43 598.29 B: (( it's just yeah )) 

599.47 599.89 A: (( wow ))
