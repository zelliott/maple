20.88 28.70 A: frank and honest here i can't even think of a place in the whole of the united states where five fifteen an hour 

29.48 31.93 A: would support a family 

31.76 34.19 B: [noise] [noise] oh it wouldn't even support one person 

35.21 35.77 B: (( [noise] ))

41.04 45.74 B: i thought it had been five fifteen for a while i guess i'm wrong 

44.72 48.42 A: [sigh] i actually thought it was like five seventy five that's how

78.83 82.17 B: i know it well you know it's it's just all 

82.93 94.80 B: people you know the people complain constantly about you know people living in poverty and you know the fact is that without an education and without 

95.31 102.05 B: the means and mental ability to to kind of get yourself going 

102.16 104.10 B: you're sunk i mean 

104.63 106.53 B: that's what you're gonna make 

106.63 107.58 A: [sigh] 

108.08 116.01 B: unless you get a job like waitressing or something where the wa- minimum wage is like two dollars an hour but you keep tips 

116.22 129.18 B: and i know that a lot of people make really good money that way but you can't count on it i think that should be illegal i think they should have to pay the minimum wage period and then still keep their tips [lipsmack] 

130.84 132.51 B: but [sigh] 

132.10 140.21 A: i i'm just so disappointed that it's so inadequate of a increase 

141.20 141.97 A: to

142.21 150.90 B: oh uh you know it would've been interesting to find out what they uh increased it from i'm s- i i think it was like four seventy five 

151.38 152.37 B: but 

153.11 160.12 B: nobody can be expe- i mean one person couldn't even live on five fifteen you know you could but you'd live in a 

160.19 167.05 B: crummy place if you could afford a place you couldn't i mean you know you would eat very little you would have no 

167.24 168.42 B: no 

168.51 172.05 B: income for medical care medication 

172.42 174.83 B: there would be no extras

196.32 198.31 A: what's the use of having insurance 

198.35 199.22 A: now 

199.75 202.56 A: i can only imagine how it would be 

203.10 210.78 A: um to work at minimum wage try to support a family and be honest and upright 

211.47 213.43 B: (( oh yeah and [mn] )) 

212.67 219.62 A: do you remember that marie that just came out um about the guy uh who's had a sick little boy

220.03 222.44 A: who needed a heart tran- yeah 

222.52 229.37 A: it th- this is this kind of scenario that we set ourselves up for in some way or another 

224.00 224.56 B: (( [noise] )) 

229.20 230.50 B: well and it 

229.44 234.86 A: to some degree or another when we when we have such an inadequate um 

231.21 232.20 B: and it 

235.10 237.87 A: base rate of pay for 

236.83 239.28 B: [sigh] well absolutely 

238.60 240.99 A: it's just oh it's so sad 

240.17 242.02 B: and it also 

242.17 243.42 B: um 

244.79 248.93 B: keeps people dependent on welfare because 

249.27 257.83 B: you know say for example you're a single mom with a couple of kids you can't afford to work you can't afford childcare 

258.02 270.32 B: you know they say why in the heck don't they get off welfare well you know what are they gonna do with their kids while they do it now i know there are some childcare subsidies but i know that they've also cut way back on that 

270.56 272.39 B: and um 

273.03 275.06 B: you know basically 

275.82 289.18 B: there's [sigh] my it's late and my mind is just blank on the word i'm trying to trying to think of but basically it it just guarantees that people will never get off welfare 

289.68 291.34 B: they can't afford to 

291.29 293.33 A: i think another thing that 

291.36 291.92 B: (( [noise] )) 

293.71 297.56 A: having such an inadequate raise in the minimum wage 

297.81 300.49 A: is it's dispiriting 

300.56 305.03 A: it's very disheartening and and it takes the spirit out of a man 

305.61 310.01 A: much [mn] uh you know who is the breadwinner of the family 

311.07 313.79 A: who is trying to support his family 

313.88 315.09 B: i know 

313.93 317.90 A: imagine imagine how that would make uh a guy feel 

317.70 319.49 B: well i agree with that 

318.17 323.13 A: to have to to have to have such a low income and 

323.14 328.03 A: perhaps the mother of his children is going to have to go out and get a job 

328.08 333.05 A: or perhaps he'll have to work overtime and then not be there very much for his family 

333.26 335.23 A: or even worse 

335.66 337.39 A: he'll have to um 

338.71 340.29 B: perpetuate [sigh] 

338.86 340.88 A: (( oh he'll have to resort )) 

340.95 342.04 A: to um 

342.12 344.43 A: some dishonest uh 

344.48 346.22 A: means of income 

346.59 349.36 A: to supplement his income and 

348.61 353.56 B: right the word i was thinking of was perpetuates it perpetuates welfare 

352.45 354.44 A: oh oh 

353.67 360.36 B: but and this is where i have my major argument with our welfare program um 

361.87 365.92 B: you know it's a it's a cliche but the saying you know teach 

365.94 371.45 B: give a man a fish and he eats for one day teach him to fish and he'll eat for the rest of his life 

371.64 378.98 B: you know these entitlement programs just drive me crazy because it makes people so dependant 

379.05 381.41 B: on the government you know 

381.58 387.82 B: even should they have a little glimmering of ambition or an an urge to 

387.99 393.38 B: to improve themselves they're stuck because if they do 

393.46 395.55 B: you know what are they gonna do 

395.57 400.39 B: uh they'll lose their benefits and you know gra- [mn] 

400.50 404.95 B: granted you know that's kinda the idea behind it but 

405.10 409.56 B: the problem is you can't go from being in that situation 

410.26 414.96 B: overnight to making a living wage you know it takes some 

414.99 418.34 B: it takes some retraining it takes some education 

418.42 421.04 B: it takes uh 

421.05 423.95 B: you know maybe vocational counseling 

424.37 433.62 B: but these things they put so many strictures on people to just be able to survive 

433.76 435.57 B: that um 

436.84 442.11 B: if they have the motivation to try to better themselves and get out of the system 

442.31 443.50 B: (( they're )) 

444.45 450.43 B: trapped because they can't afford to they don't have the means to make the transition 

450.47 453.89 A: [sigh] mhm you know what now that you and i are aware 

453.98 462.43 A: of it being so low and that the new raise in rate is gonna be so inadequate 

464.07 476.47 A: i i wonder if we need to start [mn] and i w- i'm gonna do this i i'm gonna commit to this right now i commit to starting to talk about it with other people and um try to find ways that we can talk 

476.55 479.19 A: to and email or write to 

479.81 482.70 A: um people in my state 

482.82 489.50 A: [lipsmack] um that can perhaps try to find a way to make a difference and get something 

489.95 491.66 A: more going on 

491.98 493.65 A: i know that 

493.70 500.84 A: change takes people who are willing to talk about it and care enough to make something happen 

501.49 504.81 A: i know that that's how change comes about in america 

504.59 506.37 B: (( [sigh] [noise] [noise] [sigh] well i kinda s- )) 

505.25 510.55 A: and that's one of the wonderful things about america so if we feel strongly enough 

508.36 508.92 B: (( [noise] )) 

510.61 515.30 A: and we let it matter s- so that we're willing to expend energy and time 

515.42 523.60 A: and get enough people enrolled into um wanting to do something about it change can happen because of that 

523.38 527.31 B: [sigh] well that's true but on the other hand 

527.34 527.90 B: [sigh] 

529.57 542.31 B: they have got especially the very small businesses you know a guy's trying to make a living he's got maybe a few employees they're very low skilled you know menial labor 

542.92 547.29 B: chances are he can't afford a heck of a lot more than that 

546.70 548.64 A: yeah but you gotta understand 

548.74 549.69 A: um 

550.00 561.25 A: there's a lot of opportunities right now and there has been for a few years now where um there companies can get supplemental they can get part of their wages paid for 

561.59 564.10 A: there's different kinds of government programs 

564.40 566.83 A: that they can get some of their wages 

564.53 572.90 B: well i think the focus needs to be to the focus needs to be to educating companies about that because 

573.57 582.33 B: you know you- you're kind of walking a fine line you know you've got a guy who's got some ambition and he's trying to make a go of a small business 

582.56 584.01 B: but 

584.06 592.81 B: it's you know it's kinda dangerous when the government says okay you know you are going to have this much overhead 

592.86 598.41 B: whether you can afford it or not so what happens to him he has to shut down the business 

598.62 599.89 B: uh get a job
