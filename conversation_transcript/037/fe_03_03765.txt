0.00 2.15 B: hi my name is jamie 

2.48 4.39 A: hi i'm dorothy 

6.28 7.64 A: (( dorothy willett )) 

8.11 8.94 B: hello 

9.74 12.63 A: what was the topic i didn't understand 

11.76 22.17 B: oh we were supposed to talk about comedy and uh what's where should the line be drawn in terms of uh comedy with good taste and bad taste i guess 

21.12 22.05 A: uh-huh 

22.73 25.33 A: well if the comedy 

22.74 23.50 B: um 

25.68 28.41 A: is uh funny and not 

28.77 32.35 A: hurting anybody you know not laughing at somebody 

30.08 30.97 B: mhm 

31.94 33.42 B: mhm 

32.79 36.97 A: it's fine but when the comedy gets out of hand and 

37.19 40.22 A: ac- actually picking on a certain person 

40.35 42.07 A: you know laughing at 'em 

41.40 42.90 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

42.51 45.62 A: then i think they should draw the line there what do you think 

45.11 53.78 B: yeah well i think it's really hard because [mn] like i think most of the comedy shows i've been to it's always targeting someone or making fun of somebody 

53.43 54.36 A: uh-huh 

54.12 58.72 B: and um often times it has to do a lot with race 

58.44 59.36 A: right 

58.73 65.22 B: and it i think it's i mean i think the question is can comedy exist without making fun of somebody or something 

65.35 67.34 B: so i mean 

65.52 66.34 A: yeah 

67.55 74.70 B: l- like where do you think the line should be drawn because i know you said that it should be drawn as long as no one's feelings are getting hurt but i feel like 

74.64 82.56 B: someone's getting hurt or something even though it's not like a person it's still being attacked sometimes 

80.81 82.38 A: yes that's true 

82.57 84.80 A: i'm just thinking in the 

84.82 87.70 A: line of like the little rascals 

87.17 88.29 B: mhm 

88.07 89.10 A: you know i think 

89.32 91.82 A: i don't think it hurts anybody 

91.80 93.94 B: yeah 

91.86 96.69 A: or you know and uh like bud abbott lew costello 

96.22 97.43 B: mhm 

96.73 100.82 A: those kind of comedy but the comedies that get there and 

101.17 104.66 A: and start you know like picking on uh 

104.77 108.12 A: presidents or or uh 

108.51 109.43 A: you know 

109.53 112.58 A: people in in news all the time 

112.27 113.54 B: mhm 

113.18 115.42 A: like that i mean also 

115.98 119.50 A: there's a lot of comedy about heavy people 

119.11 120.07 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

120.00 122.81 A: and i think that's terrible 

122.30 124.39 B: i think it's terrible also and i 

124.47 125.45 B: i mean 

125.50 132.30 B: like i know what you're saying about like little rascal humor like that's sorta like i guess innocent comedy more targeted towards children 

131.91 132.95 A: right 

132.48 139.30 B: but i mean do you think people will still think it's funny i mean do you think it's possible that 

139.73 143.43 B: people can find things funny without it hurting someone 'cause i feel like 

143.79 147.86 B: i don't know that seems to be the easiest for comedians to go 

148.34 149.39 B: um 

150.15 151.24 B: so 

151.03 154.76 A: yeah or they're get there a comedian will get there and 

151.66 154.57 B: (( yeah )) 

154.82 162.10 A: uh start talking about his mother what she did and and you know i don't think it's funny then 

158.44 160.45 B: yeah 

161.84 162.82 B: mhm 

162.53 163.64 A: (( [laughter] i don't know )) 

163.25 164.27 B: yeah 

164.07 165.62 A: oh gosh 

165.63 169.48 B: yeah i don't know i think the line should be drawn though especially if it's attacking 

169.53 177.65 B: someone about their sexuality or their weight or their you know their ethnicity because those are very sensitive topics and 

173.60 174.65 A: their race 

177.69 180.72 B: you know i mean of all places i don't think 

180.80 182.59 B: like a comedy place 

182.63 186.01 B: even has the right to talk about stuff like that 

186.06 186.95 A: right 

186.65 195.78 B: 'cause i mean even like in the news or something you know it's like y- you know better not to say something bad and then in the comedy club it's like you know especially like after nine eleven 

195.66 196.74 A: right 

195.75 210.24 B: you know everyone's like making all these jokes and yeah and i know i i've been to a few comedy clubs and they you know always try to make fun of like different people at different tables and like they try to get every single like 

198.97 199.94 A: (( mhm )) 

210.10 216.88 B: you know like if you from like the south or if you're from you know the west and they make fun of your accent and stuff like 

216.06 220.07 A: that is that is very true right there mhm 

218.23 219.99 B: yeah mhm 

220.33 221.32 A: 'cause i'm 

221.46 223.97 A: from northern maine here 

223.18 224.05 B: mhm 

224.40 227.45 A: and i get attacked a lot on my 

227.54 229.17 A: accent [laughter] 

228.69 229.80 B: mhm 

229.59 232.47 A: and they kind of like uh 

233.62 239.38 A: think that you're from nowhere e- especially way up in the rustic county 

236.08 237.09 B: yeah 

239.11 240.58 B: mhm 

239.93 242.10 A: and there's a lot of uh 

242.45 246.71 A: french intermit- you know like canadian french and 

245.92 246.94 B: mhm 

247.38 251.05 A: and the call it the valley the french of the valley 

250.50 252.03 B: (( mhm )) 

251.93 255.51 A: and uh they make a lot of jokes about us 

255.70 258.00 A: frenchmen call us frogs 

258.47 263.82 B: [laughter] so what what do you think is acceptable then or 

259.15 259.93 A: (( [laughter] )) 

263.96 264.94 B: i mean 

265.20 270.92 B: what do you think can can comedians even talk about then if they can't talk about these mean things you know 

270.75 272.28 A: yeah well 

272.42 274.91 A: they don't have to be mean about it you know 

274.04 275.37 B: mhm 

276.91 281.11 A: and just accept the person the way he is he is or she is 

280.72 281.65 B: mhm 

281.80 283.25 A: and uh 

283.50 287.53 A: not go on and on about the way their accents is i 

289.76 292.23 A: guess i'm not making myself clear here 

291.84 299.24 B: no i no i understand but then like it it's just really it's a really hard question to answer i think like where should it be drawn because 

296.86 297.98 A: yeah it is 

299.39 303.23 B: there's so many different types of comedy and each comedian has their own 

303.28 304.45 B: style 

304.20 305.16 A: uh-huh 

304.65 308.31 B: but yeah like like i said earlier like i just think 

308.55 311.89 B: like personal sensitive issues like 

312.11 313.81 B: you really shouldn't be 

313.92 328.51 B: like people shouldn't be attacked for those things i mean like they'll laugh about it if like a comedian's in their face and making fun of them 'cause what else are they supposed to do you know like if they get mad then they're gonna make fun of them even more i've seen people get up because they were upset 

325.66 326.55 A: right 

328.57 329.45 A: right 

328.84 333.11 B: you know and they left the comedy club and they still make fun of them until they leave the door 

332.82 334.24 A: oh my goodness 

333.54 336.30 B: yeah so i just think that 

336.73 338.57 B: it it's hard to say because like 

337.94 342.66 A: yeah i haven't been to any live comedies or stuff like that 

339.50 340.32 B: uh-huh 

342.56 346.67 B: [noise] yeah like t._v. yeah 

342.82 345.81 A: all all i do you know what's on television 

346.24 347.89 A: that's all i see 

347.56 353.66 B: and especially now i think there there's a lot of jokes about like you know the president 

353.84 356.12 B: and just like politics 

356.10 357.14 A: oh yes 

356.48 365.47 B: and the war and like even in like um sort of i guess like cartoons in the um in newspapers like comic strips and stuff 

363.05 363.99 A: right 

364.41 365.78 A: yes yes 

366.03 369.46 B: (( yeah )) 

366.13 366.94 A: (( yes )) 

367.19 368.60 A: even uh 

368.63 370.54 A: i have a web t._v. 

370.23 371.47 B: mhm 

370.79 374.18 A: and all there's so many jokes that come through 

374.54 378.55 A: on on you know laughing about people or i mean 

376.83 377.86 B: mhm 

378.91 381.91 A: uh there's one like bomb iraq 

382.56 383.97 A: about the 

384.80 386.49 A: uh saddam 

386.21 387.23 B: mhm 

387.55 388.70 A: (( uh )) 

389.24 390.22 A: well 

390.50 392.50 A: we all know [laughter] 

392.24 394.28 B: (( yeah )) 

393.22 396.05 A: we all know what that is all about and 

395.37 399.39 B: yeah and there's even like um games that they made on the internet 

399.36 400.20 A: right 

399.72 406.51 B: like where you can like shoot him or something virtually yeah and i think that's just pretty disgusting [laughter] 

401.61 402.98 A: shoot him yeah 

403.30 404.88 A: bomb iraq 

405.74 409.15 A: and i mean it's getting carried away 

410.72 413.59 A: because it you know so many innocent 

413.90 414.55 B: (( mm )) 

413.95 415.56 A: (( people are dying )) 

415.85 417.15 A: being killed 

417.55 420.40 A: not that i i'm against it 

420.07 420.85 B: mhm 

420.52 424.05 A: you i i imagine we have to do what we have to do but 

424.29 428.29 A: let's not make a big joke out of it it's bad enough as it is 

429.04 431.25 A: that's how i feel about that 

430.96 432.40 B: yeah also 

432.53 445.21 B: like i guess i mean there's that show politically incorrect or something i just read an article on how the show got cancelled because the host like john maher or something he made like some 

445.24 447.53 B: like joke about a 

448.03 457.19 B: i don't know i think about the president or something and then it's cancelled now so i mean you know there's a certain degree of censorship like in terms of bigger media but 

451.36 452.06 A: (( uh-huh )) 

457.33 464.86 B: i don't know i think as viewers and as consumers we have to be really critical of what we're taking in 

457.33 457.99 A: (( mm )) 

464.93 465.80 A: right 

465.11 475.26 B: you know and because a lot of times like people might take it has fact or and that that's where it becomes dangerous like that's why i guess the question is where do we draw the line 

471.53 472.47 A: (( yeah )) 

474.90 475.85 A: mhm 

475.31 480.70 B: um like where does the separation happen between like fun and games and like 

480.84 484.92 B: it being serious and like internalizing it i guess 

484.63 485.78 A: mhm 

485.22 486.09 B: (( so )) 

486.14 488.77 A: yeah and uh 

486.60 487.66 B: yeah 

489.78 497.24 A: what is the name of those girls that sing uh they banned it they they want to ban yeah yeah 

494.39 497.78 B: oh the dixie chicks yeah 

497.82 501.55 A: i i don't i mean that's not a comedy or anything but 

500.35 501.21 B: (( mm mm )) 

502.00 503.00 A: uh 

504.07 505.62 A: she just spoke 

505.95 507.21 A: how she felt 

506.92 507.74 B: mhm 

509.03 510.51 A: but i don't know 

509.96 513.41 B: yeah and i think through comedy it's sort of a median for 

513.41 526.73 B: people to make like i guess political statements as well or like int- their stance about like how things are going right now and like i mean it's coming off as if they're making fun of something but they're also saying something 

526.83 527.72 A: (( right uh-huh )) 

526.94 532.74 B: serious i guess and i mean that's important too i i don't know it's it's really hard to say because like 

532.82 537.42 B: you know they're making fun of something 

537.85 545.92 B: but i don't think they're intending to hurt it they're just trying to get a message across as well about like what they're feeling about something rather than being critical about it 

541.95 542.90 A: right 

545.70 546.89 A: mhm 

546.32 548.85 B: um because they don't think it's right 

548.03 552.02 A: same like with i remember watching like the archie bunker show 

550.64 552.34 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

552.62 555.49 A: and some of his comedy you know i mean he was 

555.54 556.65 A: terrible 

557.68 560.91 A: he he picked a lot on he picked uh 

561.34 565.37 A: against he didn't like colored people from the way it sounded you know 

564.59 566.61 B: mhm yeah 

565.89 567.69 A: he was [laughter] always 

568.19 569.36 A: saying something 

570.13 571.17 A: about 'em 

570.86 573.03 B: yeah it's pretty horrible i agree 

572.22 580.11 A: right in right in his in it was in the s- you know in the the uh skit there whatever you call it 

578.24 581.23 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

581.60 582.40 A: yeah 

583.13 585.48 B: yeah so i mean i really don't 

585.62 596.09 B: watch too many i don't watch t._v. that much and i don't really go to comedy clubs except like you know like maybe like i've only gone to like maybe two because it was free 

588.21 589.53 A: i don't either 

596.13 599.63 B: and i've found myself feeling very uncomfortable 

599.12 599.89 A: mhm
