30.25 36.20 A: actually we have a couple of comedians down here they like picking on your bad weather right now so 

36.12 37.59 B: i can imagine that [noise] 

36.95 42.27 A: yeah they think it's really funny you know we're sitting here down in tee shirts and stuff because we have the comedy warehouse 

42.16 52.11 A: and they just get started about the tornados and all the bad weather and we're going it's really not funny you know [laughter] i'm actually from new york so i'm used to the snow and everything so but 

44.81 46.35 B: oh yeah 

49.89 50.92 B: no oh okay 

51.28 52.43 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

53.22 57.88 A: right we have comedy acceptable humor and bad taste um 

57.86 69.14 A: i'm in my thirties so i'd probably be i'm a little bit more acceptable to a lot of the humor i think i know my mom used to find it amazing to have like curse language or anything like that in it i'm 

69.12 78.83 A: kind of acceptable to it i don't like it when it gets really offensive i do have a child so i will turn it off and i'll tell him you know you can't use that language and 

78.71 82.98 B: i i would agree i think language is one thing i think um you 

83.44 88.11 B: know i also think it's funny you know we just had a war going on and you know 

86.33 87.13 A: yeah 

88.29 95.80 B: it's almost like a matter of time before you hear jokes coming on about like the war when is it when is it an acceptable time to 

92.72 93.86 A: yeah 

95.87 108.96 B: have a discussion about have be no comedy at all and when is it can we start making jokes and laugh about it and when are they gonna star talking about it on the tonight show or whatever it is um it seems like 

103.61 104.55 A: i know 

109.20 114.59 B: i don't know there is like a window of time between when something is real and when it has passed mhm 

113.94 128.43 A: yeah there is especially with the war 'cause i think it hit everybody whether you are lea- involved in it or not i mean i was raised in the military so i [mn] i've been in with it all my life and i didn't think some of the things i mean media does have it swayed where they have the the freedom of speech 

122.11 122.94 B: right 

128.32 131.76 A: but there is a part to where it should be stopped you know it's like 

130.96 132.85 B: definitely um 

131.80 140.63 A: some of the things they did say were not humorous they were actually kind of vulgar it was like wait a minute you know those are your servicemen over there and 

140.20 153.73 B: yeah and you know when is it okay to you know joke about the president or make fun of the president you know saturday night live seem to hold off on you know making bush jokes for a while even after september eleventh and 

144.56 145.33 A: yeah 

153.90 161.20 B: um i'm probably more apt to be offended by you know something of that serious of a nature than just a curse word mhm 

160.58 169.59 A: yeah that's me too i'm very much to where if it's something that deals with life and something that's going on like nine one one or the war or anything like that like the tornados 

169.92 180.02 A: anything that's like life threatening because that's something that everybody gets involved in that's a little bit more to me than okay you know eddie murphy gets on t._v. and he just starts cursing or george carlin or 

173.38 174.26 B: right 

180.05 187.48 A: any of those i mean they've been in business so long they're standard comedian and they've been in t._v. they know what they can and can't do 

187.33 193.09 B: mhm mhm do you think it's okay if um you know kind of switching gears do you think it's okay if 

193.34 200.65 B: you know we talk a lot about racial humor and jokes about women versus men or blonde jokes or ethnic jokes 

195.38 196.30 A: mhm 

200.65 213.04 B: you know is it okay for a black person to make fun to make black humor or is it okay for a woman to make a blonde woman to make blonde jokes but not for somebody of the other race or another gender 

213.01 216.15 A: i guess i'm actually a little bit more open i'm actually blonde 

215.86 217.60 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

216.16 225.91 A: and i make a ton of blonde jokes i go oop there's a blonde moment um so it's one of those things i always do everybody's used to me saying it it's just like a man they laugh all rig- 

218.74 219.52 B: yeah 

224.94 227.88 B: but would you be offended if uh 

226.12 227.01 A: yeah 

228.25 234.48 B: uh a white male made a blonde joke more so than if a blonde woman made a made a blonde joke uh-huh mhm 

233.86 242.11 A: not necessarily but like blonde i think it's more like when they get in like the heavy weights 'cause a lot of people can't really control how much they weigh 

241.97 250.33 A: or they go into like some use religion or some use like heritage when you get something that means something to somebody and you pick on it i think is where they should draw the line 

250.38 260.66 A: as far as your hair color you can change it at will you know [laughter] i actually have i got sick of blonde jokes for a while i remember i was like eighteen and i went over and changed my hair color to brown and black and red 

252.65 255.63 B: [laughter] yeah 

261.06 273.48 A: just to see what else i would get and there's jokes about everything in that i think when it gets like i said when it gets down to somebody's heritage or like your religion or even politics i mean some of the political jokes they put out are just like 

273.37 278.21 A: i don't get 'em half the time why would you make a joke like that you know 

276.56 277.56 B: right 

277.86 282.31 B: i don't know yeah i i would agree i have pretty thick skin it doesn't offend me too much i 

281.12 282.14 A: yeah 

282.39 288.01 B: think that sometimes people worry about being politically correct more than they probably have to i think that 

287.82 301.17 B: humor can actually kind of uh cross over those barriers and break the ice a little bit between things but i think you know there is a my- i don't know it's like that pornography line you know it when you hear it more than 

293.97 295.10 A: yeah 

299.30 300.40 A: mhm 

301.17 311.16 B: uh it but you know it's hard to judge when somebody else's line is where they draw their line so i think people refrain unless it's somebody they know very well from 

305.96 307.03 A: yeah 

310.08 310.93 A: mhm 

311.58 314.18 B: uh making a comment or making a joke 

313.91 322.62 A: yeah and i think i'm a little bit well i worked at disney for a while and i think i'm a little bit 'cause they really thrive on like diversity and what you can and can't say 

317.10 318.02 B: (( mhm )) 

322.08 323.13 B: mhm 

322.49 330.50 A: and i was beat so much into it i see myself as more towards i'm a little bit more unacceptable to some of the humor than i was before 

329.04 329.80 B: (( mhm mm )) 

330.65 338.36 A: because when i was growing up i really didn't realize i'd hear the jokes and i'd laugh at 'em not think about it to what y- you know if it included me what it would be said 

338.16 352.08 A: and now that i've gotten older and i've worked at disney and it's like they have a lot of the gays and we have a lot of i worked at our pets so we had people from all different nationalities and we would sit down and somebody would make a joke and just watching how it came out to each different nationality that was sitting there 

344.73 345.90 B: (( right mhm )) 

351.85 354.72 A: or if it was a guy or a girl sitting there or w- you know 

355.12 358.58 A: what even your sexual relation is it would make a big difference 

358.73 365.56 A: and i think comedy is trying to hit all that but they don't quite know where to hit to where it's you know that level playing field anymore 

362.62 363.33 B: yeah 

365.30 377.81 B: it's probably a little easier for somebody on stage to say a joke than somebody in a circle of friends but i i think you raise an interesting point that the more you become sensitive to other people's issues by being around people of 

370.72 371.84 A: yeah 

377.91 382.84 B: uh diverse backgrounds the more likely you are to be offended by something 

382.30 395.76 A: it is it is yeah my parents raised me like really strict so it was like for me to even get in some of the places i was like i didn't even know you know i couldn't even watch cartoons when i was a kid i couldn't watch like comedy shows unless my parents were sitting there and they had to explain like everything 

385.97 386.81 B: uh-huh 

390.79 392.10 B: [laughter] 

395.84 399.26 A: and i remember when i was growing jeff foxworthy came in 

399.29 400.18 B: mhm 

399.58 406.37 A: and he was like okay redneck well my dad was redneck so it sort of like hit home and my dad would laugh at him 

404.70 405.67 B: yeah 

406.09 407.10 B: right 

406.66 413.80 A: and i looked at my dad and i'm like dad if you were raised on farm you did all that and he goes but it's funny he goes 'cause i look back on my life and go 'hm i actually did that' 

413.31 414.58 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

414.11 424.50 A: and we were actually in the car when it came on because we would drive back and forth to our camp ground and my dad was always the one that said you know comedy could be really nice and pleasant like that we listened to it every time 

424.32 432.51 A: or he goes he switched to one that was like really racial and he goes or it can be like this so i was raised to where if you cross that border you just turn it off 

432.22 433.17 B: mhm 

432.56 441.47 A: or i'll walk away from it you know and i've seen so many people do that but at the same time the media needs to know that it really shouldn't be there you know 

433.64 434.63 B: mhm 

441.83 443.37 B: right i 

442.66 448.04 A: i know at disney they cut a lot out even if they do a filming and something comes up you know bam it's gone 

448.56 452.26 A: i mean they did a country music award show the colgate one 

452.27 463.13 A: and they had a big guy in there named bubba well he was i wanna say two fifty plus he made a joke about his belt buckle that if he sneezed once it would hit the guy in the head they bleated that right out 

457.06 457.87 B: mhm 

462.72 464.38 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

463.78 464.89 A: that was gone 

464.68 466.78 B: wow so they're very careful 

464.94 465.69 A: (( it )) 

466.18 471.01 A: yeah and he goes all i do is tell the guy if i sneeze my belt buckle was gonna hit him in the head 

470.39 472.18 B: [laughter] 

471.93 486.49 A: [laughter] and we all the whole audience just cracked up laughing 'cause just he said it and they guy laughed or i mean he literally if he sneezed his belt buckle was gonna fly off and hit somebody in the head but [laughter] it was like disney just said no and they went and re-taped all of it 

477.27 478.10 B: mhm 

483.97 485.15 B: yeah well 

485.65 494.93 B: it's definitely probably easier for you know some probably better i guess in some ways for people to make their own decisions about what they wanna hear or not see rather but 

492.98 494.00 A: it is 

494.95 500.30 B: you know in a place like disney world or a place where they have an image to protect 

499.90 500.77 A: (( yes )) 

500.34 511.99 B: um you know there's something there and i i think the same thing goes with parents you know you it's good to like you said it's good for a parent to have some kind of control over what their kids see and hear 

504.91 505.86 A: mhm 

509.89 510.71 A: yeah 

511.72 512.65 A: oh yeah 

511.75 515.43 B: but then as you become an adult you can make those decisions yourself 

513.85 518.10 A: yeah you make your own choices but i mean my son will watch jaws 

518.01 529.08 A: but he doesn't watch most of the comedy network and stuff like that so it's [laughter] like okay jaws isn't reality it's something that just happens but comedy he even knows 'cause he'll get a joke at school somebody will make a joke about him 

519.73 521.40 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

528.24 528.95 B: right 

529.02 529.90 B: right 

529.06 535.27 A: because me and his dad aren't together any more and he'll look at me and goes that's not funny but it's just and he goes it doesn't matter 

532.52 533.74 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

535.65 545.12 A: so he's even felt it so it's something that you know you need to be like i said i think the children need to be made aware of it and then how they want to approach it when they get older 

537.14 538.22 B: yeah 

544.88 545.80 B: right 

545.23 549.62 A: you know we have more exercise to walk over to the t._v. and turn it off than you know 

550.18 552.82 A: but when you're sitting there there's not to much you can do 

552.70 564.88 B: no and you know you can be uh the best thing you do is talk about it afterwards like you said and have some you know understand tolerance and understand you know that's not necessarily truth and uh 

557.62 558.47 A: yeah 

565.00 567.09 B: you know bring it up in that way mhm 

566.61 567.38 A: (( yes )) 

568.09 580.77 A: it there is many ways i mean i i think the media does have a little bit too much i almost think there's a little too much freedom there because the media does get so spread out and sometimes what necessarily the one person said 

580.57 585.55 A: doesn't mean how it back to that comedian or the media reporter who put the joke out 

586.28 597.79 A: that that's always my thing and that's the way i was raised with my dad he goes you you have to know how to cycle out what they say too 'cause he goes like ninety five percent of it is not going to be you know how it originally started 

592.54 593.57 B: mhm 

599.44 599.90 A: (( that's ))
