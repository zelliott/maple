0.42 2.93 B: hi my name is jodie 

2.71 5.38 A: hi jodie my name's juanita 

4.74 7.53 B: juanita nice to meet you where are you calling from 

7.26 11.89 A: [lipsmack] nice to meet you um i'm calling from maine where are you 

10.85 11.61 B: (( [mn] )) 

11.66 13.53 B: i'm calling from philadelphia 

13.33 15.13 A: oh wow okay 

14.16 18.63 B: yeah so it's nice to talk to different people in different parts of the country 

18.49 19.91 A: yes it is 

19.30 21.38 B: yeah have you been doing this long 

21.24 24.22 A: no um yesterday was my first time 

23.45 24.90 B: oh [laughter] 

24.31 26.84 A: so i'm kinda slow getting started but 

26.06 29.17 B: oh well once you get going it'll be fine 

29.26 31.52 B: i've done it a couple of times now 

31.57 33.98 B: but anyway it's an interesting topic 

31.65 32.45 A: yeah 

34.37 40.62 B: and um of course in my opinion comedy has it's place it relieves 

40.84 44.63 B: everyday tensions uh however 

44.93 47.08 B: and i always have the however 

47.09 48.74 B: i think once 

48.99 53.55 B: comedy begins to poke it's fun at people 

53.60 60.52 B: and the laughs are at the expense of others be they important people or non important people 

60.99 62.76 B: i draw the line there 

62.98 67.15 B: and what i do is change the channel if it's necessary 

67.51 74.81 A: right and i totally agree um you know i mean it's [noise] fine you know in the in it's right place in the right environment 

74.88 79.93 A: um however sometimes i think it does go to extremes um 

78.50 79.58 B: mhm 

79.96 84.28 A: you know when it can be offensive at times you know um 

82.28 83.74 B: very offensive 

84.66 89.79 A: i i think sometimes i think there should be a little bit more control over it um 

88.70 89.67 B: mhm 

89.85 98.71 A: i mean i've seen a few things you know like on t._v. and stuff um that hasn't really been appropriate when there's been like kids in you know the kids in the same room 

97.13 97.92 B: right 

98.20 99.64 B: that's correct mhm 

99.44 103.17 A: you know when um and and i do agree you know it's 

103.48 107.95 A: you know it's not something that should be poked at other people or 

108.54 111.59 A: um some people [noise] you know people can make fun of or 

110.99 112.28 B: that's right 

111.67 113.00 A: what have you 

113.23 117.09 A: you know um i just think it's just totally not appropriate um 

117.77 123.29 B: well the- there's uh when you think that what we call now prime time 

117.77 118.66 A: (( you now )) 

123.13 123.94 A: (( yes )) 

123.31 131.47 B: uh anything goes practically uh what is the teaching value of that what what's the importance of that 

131.32 138.43 B: you know they as you say the kids are sitting there watching it then the next thing they're doing that in school 

139.26 148.45 A: [mn] i mean and i totally agree um you know we watch closely what you know our children watch on t._v. um i mean but there's no way of keeping 

145.14 146.24 B: mhm 

148.42 154.36 A: it all away from them you know and um i mean i'm a pretty open mom 

150.44 151.00 B: (( [mn] )) 

153.99 154.95 B: mhm 

154.38 159.10 A: and um [noise] you know trying to tea- teach your children values 

158.54 159.87 B: mhm 

159.22 163.57 A: and sometimes the comedy just you know isn't there 

162.83 164.06 B: mhm 

163.45 174.30 A: um i i find myself um you know there's some racial stuff that goes on and um and even you know currently um then poking fun you know um 

168.33 169.62 B: (( quite true )) 

174.20 180.99 A: at the war and other ethnic groups i just i think it's totally inappropriate you know my eleven year old [noise] says to me 

175.13 176.11 B: that's right 

177.09 177.94 B: mhm 

181.18 188.64 A: you know well mom you know what does that mean and i said well i said just people that aren't being very nice you know we need to make sure we don't do that 

187.99 189.59 B: mhm mhm 

190.33 191.85 B: have you um 

191.90 194.77 B: ever been in a situation say in a theater 

194.90 205.71 B: um where you know uh some comedy routine is on there which you found inappropriate have you ever had to get up and leave 

203.69 204.55 A: [noise] 

206.24 211.92 A: um i haven't been in that situation but i would get up and leave if i didn't think it was appropriate 

208.36 209.20 B: mhm 

211.25 212.21 B: (( yes )) 

212.19 220.05 A: you know um anything that i feel makes me uncomfortable or compromises in my values 

217.61 218.46 B: mhm 

219.31 220.82 B: right yeah 

220.22 225.57 A: um i feel just isn't important enough you know to even have my presence available [noise] 

222.88 223.75 B: right 

224.62 227.06 B: yeah because um 

227.70 233.53 B: the thing is i i guess the way we can deal with this is is 

234.07 247.20 B: go the route of the money you know the pockets we turn off the t._v. we change the channel or we don't go to these shows and movies or whatever maybe somebody'll get a message 

237.20 238.04 A: yeah 

247.34 252.88 B: that um generally people don't appreciate them i guess there are some people who really 

252.90 256.34 B: can shake it off but i'm not one of those people 

256.49 267.94 A: [noise] [noise] yeah i i'm not either and i think you're right um you know but i also think it would take you know a lot of people kind of standing their ground you know um 

265.59 266.39 B: right 

268.58 280.16 A: you know i mean there's a lot of [noise] issues surrounding you know a lot of different things with that too and you find that in everyday life you know um my eleven year old he you know he's an overweight child 

275.63 276.64 B: yeah 

280.25 283.56 A: and and he goes through a lot of [noise] stuff with that you know 

282.48 283.81 B: mm i'm sure 

283.71 289.15 A: um you know being teased and whatnot and then you do [noise] and you can see that on t._v. also 

288.13 289.61 B: sure yeah 

289.42 293.54 A: and that's really reinforcing i think the way other children look at it 

292.52 298.52 B: right and you can imagine his self esteem just goes down down down if he's the butt of jokes 

298.36 299.39 A: right 

298.74 302.36 B: you know and uh how unfair that is 

302.49 306.27 B: and sometimes i just get so angry and so annoyed 

306.16 318.08 B: look at the sitcoms we'll say you know i used to watch the crosby show and and generally speaking i think that that was a pretty good fun comedy routine 

308.17 309.33 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

318.91 326.38 B: but i think everything has gone downhill since then [laughter] i i spend very little time watching anything like that 

322.23 323.33 A: yeah i 

325.80 328.12 A: yeah i agree totally um 

328.18 331.83 A: i find i mean a lot of the t._v. shows you know 

331.85 336.32 A: we don't even wa- you know watch on t._v. or on anything 

333.58 335.42 B: mhm mhm 

336.33 347.84 A: um to that you know in fact i mean we might watch like a regular drama movie or something like that but as far as sitcoms um as a rule we just don't watch them you know 

341.86 343.46 B: mhm mhm 

347.87 351.33 A: and we really limit what the kids watch on t._v. 

349.79 350.72 B: yeah 

350.94 358.01 B: mhm sometimes i say to myself well what is wrong with you you know everybody is roaring laughing at something and i'm just thinking 

351.55 352.71 A: (( because [mn] )) 

358.19 362.47 B: do i wanna even be bothered wasting my time here you know 

362.80 363.56 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

362.84 373.89 B: and even with um [lipsmack] cartoons and things like that you know the we used to call them funnies when we kids i don't know some of them are not in one bit funny 

371.01 372.04 A: right 

373.92 381.78 B: you know again mocking and belittling and [lipsmack] it's very bad i think mhm mhm 

374.27 375.64 A: (( well yeah [noise] )) 

381.18 392.75 A: um you know i think so too i have issues with a few cartoons um because we also have a three year old um who likes to who like watch 'em and i found some of 'em can be [noise] you know inappropriate for the kids like 

392.52 398.24 A: you know um when i was growing up [noise] i you know we would like the flintstones and jetsons that type of thing 

397.10 398.99 B: yeah mhm 

398.38 407.39 A: um you know now like um rugrats [noise] is a big one and they have this little girl on there angelica and she's a bully 

402.23 403.15 B: mhm 

403.38 404.38 B: mhm 

407.02 407.67 B: (( mm )) 

407.55 409.20 A: to all the other kids 

408.56 410.06 B: mhm 

409.59 416.40 A: you know when it's kind like the parents take up for her you know and it's all a big joke and i thought you know this is really 

416.11 417.38 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

416.77 421.01 A: i just think it br- teaching children at such a young age isn't helping 

420.50 421.80 B: not at all 

421.16 422.74 A: those things 

422.14 429.27 B: not at all and you know when i think your job as parent is is hard enough there's so many influences out there that 

429.30 430.37 B: um 

430.31 444.70 B: uh get in the way of your job as forming your child and then when you have to deal with something like this when indeed humor is very healthy in itself i mean it's uh you know we all need to be 

434.39 435.64 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

444.64 452.82 B: uh our hearts lifted up and lightened and and things like that there's nothing like a good belly laugh over something 

452.83 456.39 B: but when it's so um 

456.36 470.08 B: [lipsmack] i don't know it just mocks so many principles and values and [lipsmack] and i don't know i'm a teacher and so therefore i i try work real hard trying to incorporate the right ideas and the right attitudes 

470.04 472.11 B: and then it's like mocked 

471.83 472.82 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

472.18 476.82 B: and i say oh my gosh you know that that's disheartening very disheartening 

477.59 479.60 A: it is and you know um 

479.67 483.82 A: i am 'cause um i have two children in school here 

483.85 493.52 A: and you know um one of the them he's special needs and he he's disabled um we're lucky to have some real great teachers and my eleven year old who's in the fifth grade um 

493.54 494.52 A: you know 

494.92 503.27 A: his teacher [sigh] he's just he you know they're really great at working with the kids but then you get the kids that don't take the teachers seriously 

502.64 503.69 B: right 

503.33 506.68 A: and it totally i mean it must be totally frustrating 

506.09 507.69 B: mhm 

506.84 520.38 A: you know um for them you know i mean the you know the children sit up and you know make the teachers or even the principals and the coaches you know like butts of their the jokes and it's i just don't see i mean 

516.99 518.16 B: right sure 

520.09 525.30 B: yeah well i i know from my perspective it's very difficult because i 

521.05 522.58 A: you know they've tried enough 

525.40 539.19 B: and i i'm i think i can speak for most of the people in the teaching profession that they work really really hard to try and and bring you know help parents form these children with right values and then 

539.19 541.03 B: all of that's happening 

541.05 544.11 B: in spite of your efforts and it's hard 

544.15 545.26 A: yeah oh 

544.23 548.20 B: but anyway we have to keep working at it and um 

548.38 559.06 B: [lipsmack] i don't know i think if you hit them in their pocketbooks then maybe these producers won't be putting out um these uh ugly old things that they call comedy 

558.79 570.73 A: right i i hope so too you know and and you know and i think and maybe this is wrong but i think the children getting the wrong idea and watching some of these comedies shows and stuff like that a lot of it's because 

571.04 580.60 A: you know um both parents are working which in a lot of situations is really necessary but the kids aren't getting what they need for values given to them 

573.65 574.59 B: mhm 

580.18 581.49 B: that's correct 

581.17 584.40 A: and so that's where they pick it up you know um 

582.96 583.80 B: right 

584.37 588.67 B: and find it hard to sort it out then when they are confronted with it 

586.51 588.01 A: (( [noise] right [mn] )) 

588.81 599.89 B: you know and i guess when you find that person or the program as you said to your child that that they're saying things that are not appropriate uh you know to help the child go through that
