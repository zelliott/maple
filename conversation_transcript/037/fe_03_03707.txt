0.64 2.18 A: amanda albert 

3.15 4.83 B: hi i'm rebecca [noise] 

5.04 5.88 A: hello 

7.64 12.36 B: [laughter] this is bizarre so we're supposed to talk about [noise] minimum wage [mn] 

12.12 18.80 A: oh i guess i have no idea i just signed up for this thing i thought somebody asks us questions 

17.29 17.87 B: [noise] 

19.16 22.76 B: no they said the topic for the day is minimum wage [noise] 

22.87 25.28 A: so we just talk about it [laughter] 

24.87 26.71 B: (( i guess so [laughter] )) 

26.09 27.87 A: oh okay well 

27.78 32.22 B: (( [laughter] i think minimum wage [noise] is a good idea )) 

32.13 33.57 A: yeah 

33.03 34.92 B: i think it should be pretty high though 

34.64 37.96 A: yeah i think it should be more than five fifteen an hour 

36.88 37.48 B: [noise] 

38.92 41.67 B: yeah five fifteen's a little absurd isn't it 

41.73 45.29 A: yeah i think they should raise minimum wage for 

45.45 47.80 A: servers and bartenders too 

49.13 54.27 B: [noise] like instead of the [noise] um the half wage in addition to tips 

52.60 56.40 A: yeah like i make three oh nine an hour and 

56.72 62.76 A: that's not enough i think that should be raised to at least five something an hour [mn] plus tips 

63.00 63.57 B: [noise] 

64.25 72.46 B: [noise] what if the minimum wage was like nine dollars an hour then would you want your minimum wage to be [noise] nine dollars or would you want it to be five 

72.45 73.55 A: um 

73.20 75.28 B: like what what do you do about that 

75.78 80.98 A: i guess i mean of course i'd want more money but that probably would never happen 

76.03 76.62 B: [noise] 

78.78 79.91 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [mn] )) 

83.10 83.97 A: (( hm )) 

86.54 87.32 B: hm 

88.63 93.26 B: it seems kind of [noise] unfair to assume that customers that like the um 

93.28 94.50 B: tax paying 

94.53 99.07 B: public would [noise] supplement like a private business owner's income 

98.97 100.30 A: yeah 

101.70 102.73 B: but [noise] 

103.37 104.50 B: (( i don't know )) 

105.07 109.43 A: i think the last time they raised minimum wage was like five years ago or something 

109.25 110.98 B: [noise] was it really 

110.41 112.23 A: or maybe even more than that 

112.26 114.50 B: well it's different in every state 

114.32 115.41 A: yeah 

115.12 120.33 B: [noise] like california i know is something like five seventy five it's it's like way higher than the federal [noise] 

119.44 120.44 A: mhm 

121.71 129.97 A: yeah i i heard there's supposed to be some increases in illinois for minimum wage but i don't know exactly when that's going to happen 

128.27 128.90 B: [noise] 

132.33 133.09 B: (( hm )) 

134.13 137.99 B: it doesn't seem to be [noise] very high on the list of priorities 

134.86 135.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

137.59 140.07 A: no definitely not [laughter] 

139.69 140.98 B: (( does it )) 

141.21 143.18 B: (( [laughter] [noise] hm )) 

144.33 145.76 B: so you're in illinois 

145.42 146.50 A: mhm 

147.09 147.87 B: (( sweet )) 

147.11 148.32 A: in chicago 

148.41 149.39 B: (( [noise] sweet )) 

151.29 159.53 B: um i don't [mn] i mean [mn] i don't know that i have [noise] an- like comments for ten minutes of minimum wage conversa- [laughter] 

158.79 164.98 A: i know i didn't i thought i was just asked questions and then you answer the questions 

165.26 167.08 A: or something but you know 

167.04 168.01 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

167.39 170.27 A: ten bucks is ten bucks that i didn't have 

170.85 174.55 B: yeah exactly it's like three hours of no tip work huh [noise] 

173.69 175.15 A: yeah there we go 

174.66 177.56 B: [laughter] um [mn] 

177.78 181.05 B: yeah like i didn't really read the instructions [noise] 

181.08 185.74 B: i totally was just screwing around on my computer when i signed up so i didn't like 

186.42 187.55 A: yeah 

186.57 191.75 B: i don't know [noise] and i thought that i'd actually cancelled i didn't realize that i was still 

191.93 194.18 B: on for it until somebody [noise] 

193.10 196.39 A: yeah i just signed up last night at like two a._m. 

196.27 198.02 B: oh my god [laughter] [noise] 

197.40 203.79 A: and um 'cause i was like oh ten bucks and you can do it up to three times for thirty dollars 

203.60 204.60 B: right 

204.07 214.45 A: and i was like wow you know for doing nothing but then i thought it was like a survey over the phone where you a- actually answered questions but to talk about a topic [laughter] 

214.35 227.28 B: [noise] [noise] i wonder if they make like if they want to see if we talk about the topic for ten minutes and if we do then [noise] you get another call and if you totally go off topic then they're [laughter] like that person sucks we can't call them anymore 

226.65 228.67 A: yeah i wonder how that works 

228.36 229.91 B: (( [noise] hm )) 

229.46 231.01 A: that's pretty weird 

230.67 234.87 B: it freaked me out when they asked for my social security number [noise] so i thought it that i had quit 

234.57 235.77 A: yeah 

235.30 237.90 B: (( 'cause i didn't want to give my social security number [mn] )) 

237.33 241.50 A: yeah that was pretty odd i guess it has to do with giving you a check or something 

239.22 239.86 B: [noise] 

242.46 243.31 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

243.00 247.02 A: but that yeah right after i hit like submit i was thinking 

247.39 253.58 A: maybe i should have checked out the university of pennsylvania or whatever the research is first 

248.85 250.18 B: [laughter] 

253.23 254.57 B: (( [noise] totally )) 

254.16 257.22 A: but you know if somebody steals my identity oh well 

258.59 260.42 B: i hear [noise] that's a real bitch 

260.24 261.45 A: yeah 

261.13 272.46 B: i work at a college and we have to be really careful lately to like shred everything [noise] that has any name and address even like not even just social security numbers [mn] because all these people have had their identities stolen [noise] [noise] 

267.72 268.79 A: oh wow 

272.23 275.87 A: well that's good to hear that people are actually doing something about it 

275.89 279.01 A: [mn] my um friend just had one of her 

279.18 283.99 A: credit cards stolen in a matter of like ten minutes somebody spent a thousand dollars 

283.77 285.48 B: oh my god [noise] 

285.11 293.92 A: yeah but lately everybody's been asking me like for my i._d. when i use a credit card or like a debit card but that's yeah 

291.44 292.02 B: [noise] 

292.09 293.24 B: oh that's cool 

294.93 299.87 A: but then times when like you don't have your i._d. you're like um oops 

298.17 299.72 B: [noise] [laughter] 

300.27 302.37 A: it really is my card 

302.39 303.19 B: (( totally )) 

303.21 303.77 B: (( [noise] )) 

305.51 306.51 B: (( totally )) 

306.66 307.82 A: so 

309.76 310.90 B: so 

311.01 315.08 B: [noise] so what do you know what they're studying aren't they studying like how people talk 

315.50 318.47 A: i think they're talk they're studying language 

317.55 318.13 B: [noise] 

318.64 319.54 B: (( language )) 

319.56 327.09 B: like how how are people actually speaking english these days or like how do [noise] strangers talk to one another [laughter] and [noise] 

319.61 320.86 A: yeah 

323.33 324.42 A: um 

326.23 334.76 A: i think it might be that but ah see all i eh all i read was a research on language and that was like one sentence 

330.59 331.19 B: [noise] 

335.29 336.38 A: and then 

336.67 339.59 A: i thought maybe they would it would be 

339.60 345.83 A: like how people between the ages of you know whatever and whatever discussed main topics 

343.65 344.23 B: [noise] 

346.04 351.21 A: but ah it seems to be more about probably like the english language or 

348.31 349.46 B: (( hm [noise] )) 

352.13 355.17 A: the words people these days use i don't know 

355.56 356.69 B: (( yeah maybe that's it )) 

356.84 359.80 A: i'd be curious to see i wonder if they actually email 

360.33 364.08 A: email you something back or you like stay on the line or 

363.23 363.83 B: [noise] 

365.88 367.01 B: (( [noise] hm )) 

367.42 378.58 B: well if it's like a university study i'm sure it'll take [noise] forever for them to gather all their data and then put it all together and it'll be published like in three years [noise] at a conference in hawaii or something 

377.96 379.81 A: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] yeah )) 

379.36 383.74 B: [laughter] and like and twenty linguists will be totally fascinated with the results 

383.96 387.14 A: yeah and by then everything will have changed anyway 

386.57 389.92 B: [noise] [laughter] totally [noise] 

390.58 396.45 B: hm well okay so i have just remembered something that's related to the topic a little bit [noise] 

396.20 396.99 A: okay 

396.99 400.37 B: [lipsmack] and like in our last mayoral election 

400.36 401.25 A: mhm 

400.46 406.15 B: i live in san francisco um [noise] which or the last one that i remember 

407.01 410.29 B: was [sigh] two [noise] thousand one 

410.16 411.12 A: mhm 

410.35 416.02 B: and everyone was talking about a living wage san francisco's crazy expensive right and so everybody was like [noise] 

414.20 415.46 A: oh yeah 

416.35 420.82 B: screaming out for a living wage which was going to be something like fourteen dollars an hour [noise] 

420.84 422.27 A: for 

422.19 424.42 B: just for everybody like that 

424.64 427.60 B: you know we have some pretty liberal policies [laughter] out here 

427.21 428.35 A: yeah 

427.63 437.47 B: but that was [noise] something that they were hoping that like the a mayor was running on that po- or um maybe unions were trying to get mayors [noise] to approve the living wage 

436.19 437.08 A: uh-huh 

438.48 440.47 B: [mn] but my god 

440.69 441.98 B: i mean [noise] 

440.83 443.75 A: so what would that mean fourteen dollars an hour for what 

443.41 445.61 B: for everybody that's the minimum 

446.25 448.47 A: [mn] no matter what type of job 

448.07 456.16 B: [noise] well no i mean it that just is the they call it a living wage but it would really just be a minimum wage [noise] that you could live on 

456.06 456.97 A: huh 

457.68 459.20 A: that makes sense though 

459.56 463.44 B: yeah that's the whole point right of the minimum [noise] wage is that it's a 

462.99 464.07 A: yeah 

463.50 469.04 B: thing so that we guarantee but we're capitalists not socialists [noise] so 

468.36 469.45 A: yeah 

470.82 475.84 B: [mn] i don't really understand the point though of having a wage that [noise] you can't live on 

476.03 485.18 B: but like requires some other sort of subsidy i mean like [noise] if you need food stamps because you only make five dollars an hour like wouldn't it just make more sense 

480.11 481.09 A: mhm 

484.45 485.98 A: to pay more an hour 

485.71 486.98 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

486.57 488.58 A: exactly [laughter] 

487.84 491.21 B: [noise] [laughter] i don't really get that [laughter] 

490.61 491.86 A: well 

491.91 495.71 A: like fourteen dollars an hour is like you know pretty decent 

493.77 494.36 B: [noise] 

495.94 497.32 B: yeah 

496.72 501.75 A: pay especially if you were able to work you know full time forty hours a week 

500.29 501.01 B: [noise] 

502.66 507.72 A: but if you work full time at like five fifteen an hour you only make two hundred bucks a week there's no way 

507.35 507.91 B: (( [noise] )) 

507.85 510.09 A: especially if you have like a family or something 

509.62 512.20 B: [noise] yeah exactly 

513.97 515.31 A: although i don't really 

514.31 521.59 B: [noise] and so then you need like federally subsidized child care and you need like headstart and you need school lunch programmes [noise] and 

520.73 521.84 A: yeah 

521.95 525.26 B: and all [laughter] these extra things [noise] i 

526.09 530.70 A: i wonder if all the minimum wages around the country are around like five something 

532.16 533.50 B: (( think they must be [noise] )) 

535.95 536.82 A: hm 

537.19 540.03 B: 'cause i would imagine we'd have one of the higher ones [noise] 

539.83 541.08 A: yeah 

540.15 542.47 B: i mean like where else would it be very high 

542.00 543.71 A: probably new york 

543.69 544.97 B: (( new york you think's higher )) 

545.98 546.57 B: [noise] 

546.79 550.43 A: i think it's the same in illinois like 

550.85 553.32 A: and missouri it's the same 

552.50 553.19 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

553.90 557.69 A: i guess maybe it's done by regions i don't know if it's done by states 

558.37 560.18 A: or maybe it is because 

560.44 564.18 A: those things are voted on in state ta- state elections 

560.55 562.28 B: well probably over there 

564.40 566.14 B: oh yeah that's true [noise] 

566.48 574.69 B: but then there's states that [noise] like are so close to each other and like you know like kansas city [noise] shares kind of two states 

574.09 575.19 A: yeah 

575.09 580.64 B: they probably have [sigh] some kind of something to [noise] make it all work together 

580.48 581.62 A: yeah 

581.56 583.76 B: make it all cohesive 

583.66 587.46 A: i wouldn't mind getting paid fourteen an hour plus whatever 

587.86 589.47 B: (( [noise] yeah that'd be okay )) 

589.63 593.14 B: what i would really like though is like state [noise] health care 

593.20 594.27 A: yeah 

593.91 596.50 B: that's what i think is the best 

596.98 598.19 A: mhm 

597.60 599.89 B: [noise] so what if ah [noise] we keep them in
