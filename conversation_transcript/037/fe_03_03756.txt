8.44 9.83 A: not too bad 

9.73 10.94 B: good 

10.28 12.68 A: so is this your first time you're dealing with fisher 

12.59 14.08 B: yeah it is 

13.94 16.62 A: uh this is this is my third time now 

16.33 19.62 B: oh is it third third call or third 

17.03 17.86 A: yeah 

18.77 22.40 A: third call third call it's pretty interesting 

19.63 21.66 B: oh okay yeah this is my 

21.71 22.79 B: first call 

22.73 26.89 A: [laughter] okay they say the subject is what minimum wage 

23.42 24.71 B: [laughter] 

26.42 30.35 B: yeah the minimum wage um being 

29.45 30.19 A: (( oh [noise] )) 

30.65 36.37 B: do you do we think it's insufficient to be raised to is it five fifteen five 

36.12 40.50 A: jeeze i didn't think it was that low i i thought it was in the seven seven dollars 

37.27 39.35 B: i thought it yeah i thought it was 

40.11 51.69 B: i thought it was too that's why i was a little bit confused [laughter] but i'm wondering if there's um you know what it seems like there's a there's a state one and a federal one maybe the federal one is lower than 

43.66 45.26 A: yeah i was i was 

51.99 57.88 B: the state one and it's just that i don't know i'm i'm in washington state are you in the same state 

57.27 58.82 A: i'm in washington 

58.62 59.47 B: okay 

59.24 61.14 A: the state of washington [laughter] 

60.32 68.44 B: yeah state of washington so i wonder if maybe it's just that the state's is higher and so you never really hear about the federal one 'cause they go by the state 

67.93 75.19 A: that's true too uh that could be well you know if if it is five fifteen that is way too low 

68.55 70.37 B: i don't know [laughter] 

74.91 77.21 B: y- yes definitely i agree 

76.02 79.39 A: definitely 'cause i mean even for a single person 

79.23 88.26 B: well and even and if it's just now being raised to five fifteen [laughter] that means it was something lower than that before which is even yeah even worse 

86.04 92.83 A: you know [laughter] yeah that's true and if it yes that's true i never thought of it that way but that's very true and 

88.38 89.79 B: [laughter] 

91.62 93.40 B: yeah 

93.04 95.25 A: um have you ever had a minimum wage job 

95.62 101.64 B: um no actually i haven't um well god maybe like high school 

97.91 98.75 A: okay 

101.62 102.61 A: yeah yeah 

101.69 104.78 B: but not yeah i mean nothing recently so 

104.49 110.99 A: yeah there's there's no possible way anyone uh supporting a family could ever survive on five fifteen an hour 

109.94 117.21 B: yeah well and like you said i mean yes i don't know how a single person could do it i mean yeah [laughter] 

114.69 127.83 A: yeah and uh that's my my first thoughts when i hear about that you know uh if say it is five fifteen an hour i'm thinking right away well i'll bet you any money anyone that's getting five fifteen an hour is probably also getting food stamps 

127.65 128.66 B: right 

127.77 141.50 A: maybe some type of uh welfare aid uh who knows what you know so it's it's like uh uh well here's a government is paying them minimum wage and plus they're giving 'em food stamps because they can't make it on five fifteen an hour 

130.38 131.36 B: mhm 

141.29 142.21 B: right 

141.73 145.10 A: so it seems kinda ridiculous to me 

144.76 145.68 B: yeah 

145.70 147.02 A: (( [laughter] )) 

145.80 156.91 B: it seems like maybe if they just raised it a bit higher they wouldn't have to there wouldn't be all the supplementation of everything else and people would be able to have a little more control over their lives and maybe a little more dignity 

152.66 153.63 A: yeah 

155.89 167.42 A: i'd like i'd like to know how they uh come about that decision anyways that that figure of five fifteen an hour or se- whatever whatever figure it is how who uh how did they determine that you know what i mean 

163.59 164.90 B: yeah 

166.49 175.99 B: i don't know yeah i know i don't and it seems kind of silly that if there if if all the states actually do have them higher then 

176.20 177.23 A: well it's 

176.28 179.60 B: well it just seems kinda [laughter] silly 

178.29 183.78 A: well i know for a fact here in washington that the minimum wage is uh i think seven oh one or something like that 

183.08 187.37 B: yeah i was gonna say seven something seems much more realistic 

185.21 189.10 A: yeah and uh yeah the the five fifteen 

189.11 190.47 A: either [mn] 

189.57 190.43 B: well 

190.42 199.94 B: you i mean you wonder if somebody if that means if somebody's working fulltime at that are they also you know it seems like they'd have to be working two jobs 

199.89 208.48 B: even at that rate to you know or one job you know that's the second job like the minimum wage job is the second job 

208.13 209.64 A: sure sure 

208.57 211.93 B: but they have another job that pays a little bit more i mean i can't imagine 

212.25 214.47 B: uh [sigh] gosh 

214.24 223.61 A: well even even if even if you did that fulltime five fifteen an hour okay and just take into consideration just one person not even a family just one person five fifteen an hour okay 

214.56 216.06 B: yeah i just can't imagine 

218.40 219.29 B: yeah 

221.62 222.58 B: right 

223.66 229.57 A: um food alone is astronomical i mean for for that for those wages you know 

227.01 228.08 B: i know 

229.33 230.41 B: mhm 

229.78 235.41 A: uh twenty dollars doesn't get you nothing nowadays you go in the grocery store you know that's that's nothing at all 

233.25 236.51 B: mhm well and yeah and rent 

236.21 238.34 A: oh yeah i'm i'm just looking at 

237.27 240.22 B: i mean right there [laughter] there's nothing left 

239.80 242.55 A: [laughter] 

240.43 246.82 B: what [laughter] what do you so forget having a car forget getting a bus pass i mean how do you get around 

246.33 258.92 A: yeah oh yeah yeah that's exac- that's exactly right oh the car is totally out of the question i would you know i mean that's completely out you know in fact talking about that um uh i'm married i have a family okay i've got three kids 

247.17 248.39 B: (( how do you )) 

250.34 251.48 B: right 

256.72 257.88 B: mhm 

258.61 259.57 B: mhm 

258.92 272.33 A: and uh i don't even have a car i have to depend upon mass transportation 'cause i can't afford it i can't you know we're living off my salary my my my wife and i uh she doesn't work we don't believe in having our putting our kids in daycare okay 

264.58 265.44 B: right 

271.49 272.37 B: uh-huh 

272.27 281.77 A: we're the old fashioned tradition family that uh hey the uh father earns the money and mom takes care of the kids and and that's the way it's gonna be 

280.58 282.88 B: and not a stranger taking care of the kids 

282.75 283.64 A: huh 

283.29 285.39 B: and not a stranger taking care of the kids 

284.93 294.14 A: that's exactly right right and so we're firm believers in that so uh you know we're penny pinchers then obviously i'm not making a tremendous amount of money you know 

285.97 287.08 B: right 

288.67 289.51 B: mhm 

293.83 294.86 B: (( oh right )) 

294.28 305.65 A: we live like almost every american family round here day by day you know pay check by pay check [sigh] uh and so i don't have a car and i depend upon mass transportation uh public transportation and i can't imagine 

297.51 298.86 B: yeah no kidding 

299.02 299.86 B: right 

302.81 303.99 B: mhm 

305.60 314.34 A: uh if i were making minimum wage uh a car or [mn] that i would never even consider that [laughter] nowhere near it 

312.29 317.33 B: yeah i know it's yeah i i don't know how it's possible 

315.50 322.35 A: and i'd probably if if i were single making minimum wage i'd uh i would probably be going to uh 

319.60 320.63 B: (( [cough] excuse me )) 

322.35 331.52 A: uh places like salvation army saint vincent de paul getting handouts of food to help me out with groceries uh applying for food stamps so it's like 

326.27 328.23 B: mhm 

328.38 329.34 B: right 

330.48 336.17 B: well i mean there's a bunch of places that you know even the even the food banks and stuff around town have 

336.11 348.68 B: i mean i know like the university district food bank has uh certain days or hours or nights or something like that that are specifically for people that are working and you know still can't make ends meet 

338.79 340.51 A: mhm 

348.47 349.30 A: yeah 

348.65 360.07 B: you know so it's a specific sort of working folks time working and students or something like that so i mean it's obvious that [laughter] that it's just not you know it's not cutting it [laughter] 

353.24 354.10 A: yeah 

357.86 358.74 A: (( you know )) 

359.05 372.85 A: i'm kinda curious to know that uh this subject that uh that we're talking about you know i'd like to know how many people are also discussing this and what happens with the statistics they get out of this 

363.79 365.44 B: mhm 

372.93 375.27 A: uh whatever information uh 

375.35 384.32 A: or whatever the yeah information they're getting out of these these uh research studies who's where's it going to who's doing it i mean who's [mn] [laughter] 

381.01 381.98 B: (( oh )) 

382.34 383.71 B: right that's a good 

383.87 396.18 B: yeah that's a good point yeah yeah i wasn't really sure from the um the ad i'm trying to remember now you know to be perfectly honest i'd almost forgotten it's been like two or three weeks i think since i signed up for something 

384.66 385.83 A: (( you )) 

386.09 387.07 A: (( know )) 

395.96 396.98 A: oh yeah 

396.30 401.88 B: so and i hadn't gotten a phone call yet and so so to be honest it was just like what oh yeah 

401.24 402.50 A: yeah i know what you mean 

402.03 404.30 B: okay [laughter] but 

402.89 406.39 A: that's how it happened with me too the exact same thing yeah 

404.29 416.12 B: yeah [laughter] so um so and i'm trying to remember i guess it was just an email or something that prompted you know that i signed up for it and stuff but um yeah it would be it would be interesting 

416.06 425.18 B: to hear beyond the fact that they're collecting the data for the research itself but it would be interesting to hear what they do with the opinions about this kind of thing 

421.46 422.74 A: (( [noise] )) 

423.28 425.77 A: yeah who is gonna use this information 

425.50 426.86 B: yeah exactly 

426.54 433.11 A: you know and obviously to me i would think right now on this subject that it's probably the government you 

426.97 427.60 B: (( mm )) 

432.04 433.00 B: right 

433.13 434.92 A: know i i i don't know 

433.30 434.31 B: yeah 

434.98 438.19 A: it'd be interesting to know though what what what does happen 

438.00 450.72 A: with the information what they do do with it um but i just can't you know when they told me the topic tonight i just couldn't imagine i was thinking the same thing you did five fifteen an hour i said jeeze wasn't that minimum wage five years ago five fifteen an 

449.90 452.38 B: yeah yeah exactly 

450.92 452.96 A: hour i just said oh my gosh 

452.53 465.19 B: well and the other thing is too i mean you know like like i said if if they do go by whatever's higher and if the state is higher then you know that's great if you live in a state where it is [laughter] higher but you know those the states where they just 

465.21 474.49 B: bypass it and go with the federal one you know that must it would be interesting to hear what states are actually realistically at that lower rate you know 

473.96 479.72 A: [noise] yeah it's it's like um uh if you live in alaska you ever been in alaska 

479.15 480.01 B: (( uh-uh )) 

479.80 483.00 A: okay it's very expensive cost of living over there food is high 

482.09 485.31 B: really i didn't realize that i thought it would be 

483.07 483.98 A: oh yeah 

485.33 487.93 B: actually not as expensive as 

486.75 488.95 A: no it's pretty it's pretty high 

488.79 490.34 B: oh interesting 

489.28 495.31 A: now their minimum wage if it's five fifteen an hour [sigh] there's no way anybody could survive there with five fifteen an hour 

494.64 496.36 B: wow huh 

495.46 502.55 A: there's no possible way it's like here here in washington we moved here about a year and a half ago from oregon portland oregon 

501.70 503.64 B: oh oh yeah okay 

503.40 512.04 A: okay now portland has no sales tax but washington they have a sales tax okay so there's a little difference there but another big difference is that um 

506.38 508.11 B: mhm right 

508.25 508.93 B: i 

512.39 523.06 A: a gallon of milk being having a family and you have kids you go through milk you go through a lot of milk okay if you really sit down and figure it out you're gonna be going through a gallon at least a gallon every other day if not more 

516.71 518.37 B: right [laughter] 

522.86 523.89 B: right 

523.44 526.09 A: so a gallon of milk in oregon is like 

526.53 529.26 A: what was it sweetheart about two three dollars two dollars 

529.36 530.43 B: mhm 

529.80 537.41 A: yeah two dollars a ga- you come here in wash- we moved to washington and it's [noise] four four fifty a gallon totally a hundred percent increase in price 

536.50 539.51 B: that much difference really 

537.33 550.94 A: oh yeah yeah i couldn't believe that and there's only a two hundred mile difference between us and i'm thinking wait a minute here is this is this for real is this price all right and it is four dollars a gallon a hundred percent increase in price just in milk alone 

542.34 543.24 B: (( well )) 

547.07 548.35 B: oh my gosh 

550.92 556.71 A: and plus you gotta pay the sales tax which isn't that much but if you figure it out in the long run yeah it does add up you know 

556.20 557.52 B: wow 

556.86 565.49 A: and i'm thinking oh my gosh and then you go to alaska and who knows it's five six- it's like six seven dollars a gallon there or something like that you know i don't know what it is 

564.36 565.88 B: oh wow 

565.75 569.78 A: and uh i'm thinking oh man that's [laughter] 

569.07 573.21 B: yeah no kidding well i mean if you think about if it's if it's that much 

570.46 571.49 A: yeah 

573.05 587.61 B: for a gallon of milk i mean that's there's an there's almost an hour's worth with tax uh one hour to pay for a gallon of milk once you know during the month [laughter] so how many gallons of milk do you get you know how how much do you have to ration everything 

577.50 578.45 A: yeah 

580.62 581.60 A: yeah 

582.63 583.45 A: yeah 

584.72 586.81 A: yeah that's that's exactly 

587.46 596.89 A: and a- and milk is is is with a family's almost a necessity and it's not one of the the commodities you could say that that you can get at a food bank 

592.24 593.33 B: right 

596.36 599.89 B: exactly yeah you can't get fresh stuff like that for the most
