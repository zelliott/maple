15.11 16.68 B: th- this 

18.19 26.15 B: yeah which that kinda that kinda hits me right where i'm at sorta 'cause i'm kinda between jobs right now 

25.93 29.06 A: [noise] are you um can i ask how old you are 

29.22 31.91 B: i'm forty years old 

31.08 34.11 A: oh okay i'm only nineteen so 

33.14 39.05 B: well kinda hits you too then [laughter] 

36.12 40.81 A: yeah [laughter] i didn't even know what the minimum wage was 

41.21 47.34 B: really i didn't either but i think it's been five fifteen for like a couple of years now so for 

46.31 47.65 A: really 

47.56 51.18 B: yeah ah i've i've had kind of a 

51.62 64.00 B: varied job history kinda going from one dead end job to another for quite some time and i can't quite get past ah seven fifty an hour 

63.87 66.25 A: really where do you work at right now 

66.09 68.58 B: well right now i'm between jobs 

68.20 71.60 A: oh okay well between which jobs or 

69.49 70.92 B: but 

72.20 77.37 B: ah well the ah last job i had was a construction job 

77.97 87.17 B: and ah it paid right at eight dollars an hour but it wasn't exactly what i had in mind it was um 

87.29 90.30 B: well i i'm a carpenter by trade 

90.37 95.88 B: and i had done some union carpentry work at union carpenters 

95.94 97.06 B: ah 

98.02 102.76 B: they're seldom on the same job for any longer than six months 

102.99 107.51 A: uh-huh mhm and do you you have a family to support is that why it's really hard 

106.13 109.08 B: oh well ah it's just me and my wife 

109.01 110.16 A: oh 

109.29 114.99 B: so it's not quite as bad as if i had a bunch of kids but still um 

115.37 122.68 B: i want to do something more with my life than just kinda go from one dead end job to another 

122.80 127.57 B: and i thought the union carpentry was gonna be it but ah 

126.33 127.24 A: right 

128.68 132.71 B: ah o- one thing that i've noticed about um 

133.33 146.24 B: about the vocational training like that ah it's best if you're gonna get into something like that that you do it at the college level or high school level 

145.97 146.95 A: uh-huh 

146.29 151.75 B: rather than waiting around like i did 'til i was like about thirty eight 

151.95 153.77 A: oh [laughter] 

153.04 154.67 B: because um 

154.86 163.65 B: when you're young like that you don't have people to support and you don't have a family that expects you to go out there and make a living 

163.35 164.38 A: right 

163.63 172.30 B: and you don't have bills that have been piling up for hm ten years [laughter] or better and some 

170.76 171.92 A: yeah 

173.69 181.98 B: people just don't expect you to um support ah support yourself at nineteen and twenty 

178.89 180.43 A: yeah definitely 

181.81 194.80 A: right my parents totally fully support me and i mean i've suggested getting a job to help them out but they want me to concentrate on my schooling and so like even if i want a job my parents wouldn't want me to 

194.90 195.80 B: mhm 

195.74 196.63 A: so 

196.65 201.80 A: i mean so you'd definitely think it's not sufficient the minimum wage right now 

197.42 198.16 B: (( that )) 

201.21 209.29 B: no ah the thing about minimum wage and interesting and this comes from um 

209.31 213.28 B: this comes from actual experience in the work force 

213.63 221.09 B: if minimum wage were raised it would just make the situation worse 

221.28 222.79 B: and i'll tell you why 

223.26 224.57 A: well okay 

223.81 225.52 B: minimum wage 

225.58 233.63 B: is a standard that has been set across the country for supposedly basic living 

233.81 234.87 A: (( uh-huh right )) 

234.30 245.62 B: and it never it never measures up to that never does back when i was your age minimum wage was like three dollars and fifty cents an hour or something like that 

244.93 247.64 A: and that was sufficient enough for basic living okay 

246.32 249.27 B: that that was not sufficient then either 

249.90 257.86 B: ah right now for just a man and his wife just starting out 

257.89 263.64 B: ah i would say the minimum amount and this is just minimum 

263.71 266.82 B: that they can really 

266.86 271.78 B: barely make it on if just one of them's working is about ten dollars an hour 

272.22 273.54 A: (( uh-huh wow )) 

273.07 283.47 B: okay and that's for the deep south now that's not for anywhere else when you're talking about michigan and wisconsin and places up north like that 

274.27 275.17 A: right 

283.20 284.09 A: right 

283.48 286.44 B: it it goes up from there [sigh] 

286.20 287.78 A: yeah where are you again 

286.92 287.70 B: (( because )) 

288.09 289.87 B: and ah huh 

289.68 291.40 A: where where do you live again 

291.12 293.56 B: ah shreveport louisiana 

292.97 294.93 A: oh okay yeah 

294.12 303.59 B: and i don't know about california never been there but from what i understand the houses are a lot more expensive out there 

302.54 303.67 A: right 

303.37 309.39 B: and ah your big macs cost more your gas costs more and i mean 

306.83 307.87 A: (( [laughter] oh yeah )) 

309.22 319.21 B: ah all those things you've got to kind of weigh in the balance because you've gotta have gas you've gotta pay your electric bill and stuff like that 

309.29 310.52 A: (( definitely mhm )) 

319.02 325.63 B: and in what's called a true free market economy you've g- you can um 

326.27 335.50 B: have no minimum wage and you go out there and you bid on these jobs that are truly entry level jobs 

335.63 345.81 B: and you would be satisfied at making ah a certain level and then work up to what you're actually able to um 

343.17 344.10 A: (( right mhm )) 

346.23 348.30 B: live on actually 

348.31 354.86 B: but ah when you've got the minimum wage set well the employers say well since that's 

354.90 364.34 B: the starting level then i can put these people at minimum wage which is where i get put whenever i get started in a different career 

364.46 366.90 B: and it's not enough 

367.24 373.34 A: so what what do you think would happen if they raised the minimum wage like why would that hurt people in general 

372.18 377.57 B: ah h- here's what would happen and it's not gonna it wouldn't happen immediately 

377.83 381.91 B: let's say they moved from five fifteen to seven fifty an hour 

381.66 382.53 A: uh-huh 

382.20 390.45 B: which seven fifty an hour seems to be pretty average down here for ah an average wage rather than minimum wage 

390.22 392.76 A: mhm right here too i think 

392.35 396.74 B: and ah at seven fifty an hour if it were to go up to there 

396.75 409.88 B: then everybody has to jump to that right away so that means the people that are low on the totem pole the bottom level if they go up to that they're gonna get helped right then immediately 

409.72 410.62 A: uh-huh 

409.87 410.87 B: okay 

410.66 421.21 B: but gas is gonna have to go up food's gonna have to go up utilities are gonna have to go up all across the board in order 

420.97 426.44 B: to ah pay for this jump to minimum wage 

426.06 431.09 A: [noise] so basically you think there'd just be a surge in inflation if there was 

430.05 439.49 B: exactly a- all it does is help people on the bottom for a little while and then they're right back to square one again [sigh] 

431.50 432.47 A: i see 

439.97 443.76 A: yeah because it's all relative i understand what you're saying 

443.05 444.89 B: exactly 

444.12 447.07 A: it's all relative okay [noise] 

445.79 455.29 B: so um as for as minimum wage goes it would be better even though it seems cruel to do it this way 

455.46 459.30 B: to say let's drop the minimum wage completely 

459.56 462.39 B: and then let the free market take over 

462.22 474.82 B: because then the people that are truly on the bottom well they're gonna be on the bottom anyway there's always gonna be welfare there's always going to be somebody that's gonna get the short end of the stick 

474.64 479.46 A: but i think in a way h- not having a minimum wage would actually 

479.57 491.13 A: make it so that all i mean and like the way our economy works i think a lot of the people at the top of the you know like you said the top of the totem totem pole they would just be getting 

491.24 495.87 A: more and more money and like i- the inequality gap would just be getting bigger 

493.04 497.34 B: w- well that's okay because they work harder to get there 

497.75 502.29 A: well i don't know if that's necessarily true because even people at the bottom 

500.12 507.84 B: well it it in an in an ideal situation you're right it that wouldn't be actually true 

507.75 518.01 B: in the way things currently are but the thing is if you don't work real hard to get where you want to go you're not going to make the money 

517.50 523.53 A: that's true but i think in our society today a lot of that ideal of you know 

523.61 527.20 A: working hard will get you wherever you want that has pretty much 

527.83 536.96 A: i mean to a certain extent it's true but for a lot of people at the bottom of the totem pole it's really hard to get out of that rut i mean like you said the bills just pile up and like 

536.52 537.89 B: it is 

537.37 539.16 A: i mean basically 

537.94 549.92 B: and h- here's the thing unless you have been prepared from a child to get into something that will pay you a better than average wage which is 

548.76 550.01 A: definitely 

551.10 557.04 B: then ah you get stuck in the rut when you're about forty like i am 

557.40 570.28 B: so let's let's say for example i had taken the vocational training to get where i really wanted to be as a carpenter back when i was in high school or early in my college years 

570.30 571.22 B: then 

571.24 577.76 B: i would right now be enjoying a wage of about fifty to sixty thousand dollars a year 

578.81 579.74 A: (( mhm oh )) 

579.38 588.50 B: because i had the sense when i was younger to do something that i enjoyed and i would have been able to work my way into it 

588.36 599.02 B: which takes about ten to fifteen years to do that you know ten to fifteen years from age forty i'll be pushing retirement pretty good 

592.45 593.87 A: (( yeah d- i [laughter] ))
