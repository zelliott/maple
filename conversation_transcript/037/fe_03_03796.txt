162.20 163.54 A: [laughter]

173.24 175.10 A: oh that rough 

173.76 181.23 B: yeah i didn't really have much to say about the [noise] minimum wage but you know [noise] comedy oh golly where are you from [noise] oh

192.12 194.62 A: yeah i've only live here a few years [laughter] 

195.07 197.97 A: yeah i hope i don't have the accent yet [laughter] 

196.94 201.72 B: yeah [noise] i guess that's what they trying to hear [noise] the accent or the way we have a conversation 

200.14 201.89 A: yeah i'm not really sure 

202.05 216.75 A: but yeah i guess let's see um what's acceptable i don't know i guess personally i determine it by like who the audience is whether i'm like retelling something i mean obviously some things i feel like of course i'm gonna share them with my parents 

204.22 206.30 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

208.96 211.41 B: [noise] [noise] yes that's right 

212.08 213.67 B: [noise] mhm 

216.36 217.79 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

216.76 223.14 A: of course i would share them with my friends but then there's other things that i would completely not share with my parents but i would share with my friends 

218.70 219.98 B: [noise] 

221.60 222.28 B: (( true )) 

222.47 227.64 B: [noise] that's true i mean i mean anything that's really disgusting i would email to my brother immediately 

227.48 228.82 A: [laughter] 

227.79 241.83 B: 'cause he of course he has my mother's sense of humor he's really sick [noise] like he sends me the grossest emails [noise] i would never send them to my mother in law and father in law who are sending me religious emails so you know [laughter] what are you gonna do 

235.62 236.69 A: mhm 

238.42 239.97 A: right right 

241.67 249.06 A: yeah i think so much of it comes from is based on like who the audience is and also like what that audience has been exposed to 'cause i think like 

242.00 242.57 B: (( [noise] )) 

246.00 247.12 B: mhm 

249.19 261.74 A: if my parents were to sit down and see an episode of south park now my mom at least i mean she would find it kind of funny because like i made her watch like the south park movie and all and she's been a little bit more desensitized to it and 

249.91 250.72 B: [noise] 

253.10 253.98 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

255.21 256.15 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

257.32 258.52 B: oh really 

260.62 273.41 B: i watch [noise] yeah i watched much more of south park when i think before i had the kids and i i really enjoyed it but i find myself not having the time for it like the [noise] man show i i find some of the stuff on that [noise] funny 

270.07 270.88 A: yeah 

273.08 276.73 A: i know that's a riot but i wouldn't 

273.93 288.14 B: [laughter] but you know not everybody thinks it's hilarious [noise] so [noise] what's the matter buddy [noise] and um oh sometimes i think it's har- i don't know if i should say yes to these phone calls when my kids are awake [noise] [laughter] 

278.01 279.62 A: right right 

286.99 288.65 A: (( [laughter] )) 

288.28 290.29 B: mommy's aren't allowed to talk on the phone 

290.32 291.45 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

290.33 300.05 B: [noise] so especially okay mommy's going to walk so they like they're pushing me around [noise] so that's what it is like a conga line we're having a conga line mom talking to talking to you 

295.51 296.88 A: (( [laughter] )) 

299.91 301.70 A: [laughter] 

301.40 313.40 B: yeah the the my favorite episode of south park of course not everyone finds acceptable is uh the [laughter] when when he imitates an episode [noise] of cops and he says step out of the car i don't know if you know 

312.83 315.42 A: [mn] yes yes do you respect my 

314.05 326.63 B: i think he was ticket lover or something like that but i had a lot of trouble understanding the- them [noise] not understanding what [noise] the humor but their they understanding their [noise] they they're not very clear to me 

316.62 318.00 A: (( yeah )) 

326.77 327.52 B: like 

326.82 328.67 A: yeah yeah 

327.77 335.24 B: the chubby one [noise] i forget his name but cartman yeah i can't i can barely hear what he says and you know i'm trying to keep the t._v. down [noise] so i don't wake up 

329.41 331.03 A: cartman yeah 

335.18 346.81 B: [noise] everybody and you know what are you gonna do [noise] do do you watch that show [noise] um [noise] the futurama oh no you were just saying futurama's another show the family guy the family guy 

336.87 338.01 A: [laughter] 

338.22 339.27 A: yeah 

344.09 345.60 A: oh yeah 

346.56 350.77 A: i've seen like a couple episodes of that i think um 

348.25 349.39 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

349.71 354.92 B: i think that's supposed to be really good or that kind of humor but i i have [noise] nev- i'd like to see it 

352.30 353.18 A: yeah 

355.25 356.40 B: (( [noise] i i just haven't )) 

356.77 363.86 A: mhm yeah i don't like i don't watch a whole lot of t._v. i just make time for south park every week though and um 

360.13 361.17 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

362.33 368.80 B: yeah i know i don't watch a lot of t._v. either when i i get a chance i like to turn it off because [noise] i'm 

365.48 366.40 A: (( mhm )) 

367.86 368.75 A: right 

369.06 373.01 B: oh especially when the kids aren't around [noise] because they're so noisy all day 

373.17 377.39 B: [noise] as you can hear probably in the background they're just giggling 

375.81 380.18 A: [laughter] it's funny i feel like i get most of my news now from the daily show do 

380.35 393.83 B: oh really [noise] a little bit sometimes i i you know i have cab- digital [noise] cable five thousand t._v. channels and honestly i could probably do [noise] without it i'm like american idol that's my big i have been watching that 

380.66 382.14 A: you ever watch that 

385.90 386.86 A: mhm 

392.35 394.63 A: (( [laughter] )) 

393.90 399.82 B: so that's probably like the only show like usually it's one show i look forward to i used to love the drew carey show 

397.82 398.72 A: mhm 

399.92 402.60 B: so what kind of humor is that that's probably you know 

400.30 401.42 A: oh 

402.75 404.83 B: [laughter] 

402.83 407.12 A: yeah i mean that that kind of gets into one of those areas too where like 

407.16 414.71 A: like more and more i think like t._v. shows are trying to touch on it like what topics are okay to make fun of and what are not i mean 

412.29 413.18 B: (( yeah )) 

413.63 417.79 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

414.90 427.94 A: you wouldn't see like any show where like the majority of the cast is all one race making fun of another race but routinely you see like like on the drew carey show like they were always making like fat jokes about mimi 

418.87 420.75 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

421.46 422.77 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

427.64 428.90 B: oh yeah 

428.74 435.41 A: and that was almost like more acceptable so i don- i guess kinda guess it's a gray area too 

434.61 437.65 B: [noise] you're right it is and and you know i guess 

437.98 444.08 B: i know that is that's a shame making fun of fat people 'cause you know we all fight the battle of the bulge [laughter] 

443.99 445.78 A: right right [laughter] 

444.07 453.11 B: i know i'm constantly fighting it i mean you know uh everybody every woman i know would probably call themselves fat because you know not mimi fat but 

450.83 458.69 A: mhm yeah i guess that's one of those thing that it's funny until you look down at your own size and you're like oh wait mm [laughter] 

456.40 458.10 B: yeah i know 

457.89 469.03 B: yeah but but you know what some people do take themselves too seriously like uh i i was just saying to my mom like you know the world wants to see themselves as holier than thou perfect place 

462.45 463.20 A: (( mm )) 

468.81 473.56 B: but if you really look at it you know everybody's em- embezzling from each other and there's 

473.66 480.58 B: you know everybody's sleeping with somebody else and cheating and it's just you know that's the real world that's the real 

480.64 488.69 B: real place we live in it's sad but so why don't we joke about right [laughter] or we if we take each other too seriously 

481.69 482.64 A: (( [noise] )) 

485.05 488.12 A: mhm [noise] [laughter] that's true 

488.64 491.18 A: kind of like everything has become fair game 

490.86 495.56 B: yes so have you heard any good jokes any tasteful jokes lately [laughter] 

495.00 496.17 A: (( [mn] )) 

495.61 497.50 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

496.79 499.08 A: i know i must have um

499.95 502.37 B: on my brother's uh he i 

502.83 510.48 B: i don't know i i usually actually i i actually like the um the kind of jokes that are really dumb like uh 

510.62 515.24 B: the the pun jokes like the kids the ones that you would the kids would tell like uh

516.15 525.26 B: if a duck like the duck walks to the drugstore or if the rooster gets gets up in the morning when do the ducks get up at the quack of dawn i know that's silly but that's pretty bad 

518.95 520.00 A: right 

522.66 525.09 A: (( [laughter] )) 

525.15 530.60 A: i know one real- like really good one of those it it's long but let me see if i can start on it it's um 

528.58 529.63 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

530.13 531.47 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

530.86 538.19 A: there's this man scientist and he makes a clone of himself and the clone is exactly like him in every way except the clone has a really dirty mouth 

537.72 538.56 B: uh-huh 

538.16 549.74 A: and he's always going around calling the mad scientist names and calling his friends names and they're all getting sort of sick of the mad scientist 'cause they don't realize that it's his clone and not him 'cause they look exactly alike 

547.65 548.47 B: uh-huh
