0.00 1.97 B: [noise] hello 

0.00 1.06 A: hello 

1.56 2.62 A: hi 

2.29 3.40 B: (( hi )) 

3.58 5.60 B: this is my first time doing this 

4.88 8.97 A: [laughter] uh-oh me too so i'm not exactly sure what we're supposed to do 

6.61 7.80 B: (( ah [laughter] )) 

9.18 11.21 A: just talk about the topic fifteen 

9.24 17.59 B: ah i guess we're supposed to discuss ah minimum wage if we agree that five fifty is enough 

17.49 19.66 A: um what do you think 

18.14 21.08 B: we're supposed to [sigh] 

21.26 22.44 B: um 

23.13 24.56 B: [lipsmack] boy 

25.22 28.89 B: i would say five fifteen's not very much 

28.93 31.28 B: [noise] in today's economy 

30.87 44.22 A: [noise] yeah i mean i think there's a number of variables like where you live um that has a lot to do with it i live in california and housing transportation and um 

45.24 46.00 A: (( [lipsmack] ah ah )) 

46.38 48.04 A: and food mostly 

47.29 48.81 B: right 

48.13 55.80 A: are very very high and people making we have a serious problem in our state about the working poor 

55.64 57.23 B: right 

56.56 59.48 A: so obviously the minimum wage isn't enough 

60.16 63.11 A: to enable people to have the basics here [noise] 

63.11 66.51 B: right i can't imagine somebody ah 

66.68 70.57 B: providing for a family on five fifty an hour 

70.40 77.46 A: yeah it's very hard even professional wages aren't [laughter] enough people can't even afford houses 

74.09 75.12 B: right 

78.07 82.78 A: so [sigh] i mean i've had this debate with people before it's um 

82.90 87.49 A: ah there's a large regional aspect to this question [laughter] 

86.77 87.83 B: uh-huh 

89.69 92.79 B: yes [laughter] um 

93.18 97.30 B: i'm not even sure who gets minimum wage other than ah 

98.42 108.91 B: ah i i well i i don't know i mean when i think of minimum wage i think of like ah fast food jobs and stuff like that although i i've i 

105.49 106.56 A: right 

108.94 110.32 B: think i've seen 

110.54 112.10 B: where ah they've 

112.16 118.72 B: they actually make quite a bit more than that these days so i don't i'm not sure who's actually getting the minimum wage 

118.42 119.71 A: yeah 

118.97 120.36 B: if that's ah 

121.59 122.56 A: well 

122.95 130.65 A: i think um the concept of minimum wage is a good one but the amount may not be enough 

125.89 126.81 B: yeah 

130.16 133.76 B: yeah i can see how that could be abused very easily 

130.71 131.74 A: and depending 

133.39 136.94 A: h- how will you see how how could it be abused that 

136.33 139.81 B: well i mean just um 

140.11 141.42 B: (( make )) 

141.50 149.11 B: paying people minimum wage i mean that's just i i don't know if that came out correctly but ah [laughter] um 

146.71 148.67 A: um uh-huh that's okay 

150.40 151.32 B: (( [sigh] )) 

152.63 155.98 B: (( i i ah don't know [laughter] why not )) 

156.00 159.76 A: well i think that um m- 

156.04 157.23 B: um 

160.99 168.77 A: ah we have here in california a lot of immigrant workers who are taking the lowest paying jobs 

165.40 166.31 B: (( yeah )) 

168.92 170.65 A: so when you think it through 

171.05 178.19 A: they are living usually with a family or in a a group living situation 

178.24 181.57 A: and so they can afford to have the jobs 

181.82 183.28 A: whereas somebody 

183.31 185.09 A: who wants to um 

185.81 191.86 A: you know live and and and take care of their family and have their own home and the sort of american dream 

191.87 195.23 A: um they can't and i think that's 

195.39 198.89 A: wrong too because not everyone is a 

199.09 203.63 A: is a skilled professional and there's no shame in having a 

204.22 205.19 A: low 

205.22 212.90 A: or just a waged unskilled labor wage job and you used to be able to make it in america on 

209.00 210.41 B: right 

213.18 215.24 A: just an ordinary job 

215.03 216.22 B: yeah 

215.61 218.72 A: so it's sad now that it just goes to 

218.80 222.56 A: they go largely to immigrants who are 

222.66 232.59 A: sending that money home to their country where the dollars mean a lot more and they're living here in a like sub standard fashion [noise] 

232.07 233.12 B: right 

235.16 237.16 A: so it doesn't work very well 

236.94 242.10 B: (( no it doesn't [laughter] um )) 

238.32 239.73 A: (( [laughter] benefits )) 

242.33 246.89 B: yeah and i would imagine a lot of those people can't and don't get ah 

247.71 254.01 B: in- you know ah any benefits as well and have to get that on the side so 

253.62 257.76 A: yeah or it they're just going without and that has 

254.97 256.29 B: end up getting 

256.82 258.45 B: (( government assistance )) 

257.99 261.46 A: yeah that has quite a cost to our society 

261.12 262.57 B: yeah 

261.83 264.32 A: you know the public um 

264.37 265.33 A: county 

265.65 271.25 A: county facilities and the ones that serve the public i mean there's no preventative 

271.37 275.60 A: incentive for any preventative care for yourself if you're just living 

275.90 277.23 A: day to day 

277.04 278.93 B: right 

278.23 280.22 A: [noise] 

280.43 284.63 A: so i think i think my whole conclusion is it depends on where it is in 

280.52 281.71 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

284.85 289.96 A: where you're i think theory's good but the amount has to be evaluated depending on the 

290.31 294.14 A: cost of living actual cost of living in the part of the country where you live 

294.14 295.63 B: i agree 

295.30 297.65 A: well we've solved the whole problem then 

295.84 296.85 B: i can 

297.81 299.22 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] ))

388.97 394.98 A: experts on evaluating the pros and cons of of changing minimum wage 

395.56 396.83 A: would make some 

396.99 400.49 A: like decent arguments about it 'cause it just doesn't seem like it's working well for for 

402.90 404.48 B: [noise]
