66.40 67.29 B: yeah 

68.47 73.51 B: oh really 'cause i have been hearing about all these tornados that you know that's been tearing up all these places 

72.85 74.08 A: yeah 

73.71 75.30 B: it's horrible 

74.67 80.22 A: i know it is awful it is and we're still under a tornado watch right now 

79.31 81.15 B: (( oh really )) 

80.29 83.89 A: kinda hard to talk about minimum wage when you're looking at the sky you know 

82.68 86.18 B: sky i know oh my goodness 

85.07 89.12 A: but it looks like huston kinda got clear of 'em this time that's good 

88.06 97.34 B: mhm yeah well i guess we had our um national um natural disaster that big flood you know two about two years ago 

94.99 96.13 A: yeah 

97.35 98.07 A: ooh 

97.96 99.88 B: that was real bad 

99.08 100.07 A: yeah 

100.10 101.26 A: (( well )) 

101.28 104.24 A: i tell ya i don't know what to think about minimum [laughter] wage 

103.56 105.04 B: [laughter] me either 

104.44 109.72 A: i i would think it's not high enough for the people that are working but it's too high for the employers 

109.39 111.79 B: yeah [laughter] yeah but 

109.93 111.20 A: isn't that awful 

111.80 117.24 A: because these these poor employers these mom and pop businesses can't afford to pay a whole lot 

111.91 112.79 B: [laughter] 

115.76 121.68 B: afford mhm 'cause that's what i was thinking that and they're probably gonna be the ones you know that's gonna suffer 

121.30 122.56 A: that's right 

122.22 133.54 B: and then you know it i guess this is like a good you know way for you know somebody just starting out but you know you can't i mean i guess maybe you can support yourself on it i don't think i could 

127.11 128.05 A: yeah 

133.01 140.02 A: i don't know of anybody that can support yourself on minimum wage that's working one job now two or three maybe 

136.27 137.78 B: [sigh] no 

138.06 139.26 B: yeah 

139.58 141.05 B: yeah maybe so 

140.74 142.03 A: but i mean 

141.23 142.15 B: (( but one )) 

142.34 149.76 A: everybody i know that that anybody that i know which isn't very many people that make minimum wage are working two and three jobs you know and it 

149.14 151.25 B: mhm yes 

151.52 157.02 B: and like in this day and age you have to you know to support yourself just to try to stay ahead or to get even 

156.67 158.56 A: that's right that's right 

157.80 159.43 B: mm i know 

158.66 161.36 A: i don't see how some of these college kids make it 

161.00 162.58 B: oh no me either 

162.77 170.05 A: you know my niece is graduating saturday and she's you know she said i might as well go get a job at mcdonald's 

165.43 166.42 B: really 

170.16 171.51 B: oh 

170.87 178.27 A: you know of course she took fashion as her major and i told her i said well you know you probably could've done better than that but 

173.72 174.54 B: oh 

178.54 182.05 A: [laughter] you can't tell kids anything can ya 

181.48 183.77 B: [laughter] no you sure can't [laughter] 

183.46 187.63 A: but i i just i cannot imagine living on five fifteen an hour 

187.27 189.17 B: no i couldn't either 

188.60 190.40 A: i i really can't 

189.81 196.77 B: that's like real uh you i'm i'm pretty sure that's probably you know at the poverty level i mean i know it should be increased but i don't 

197.16 201.07 B: i couldn't like say you know what's a good amount to increase it to 

200.85 201.87 A: right 

201.54 206.75 B: and especially because it really depends like you know where you live at you know how inflated prices are and stuff 

205.73 210.60 A: i was thinking that too i mean five fifteen is nothing in california 

210.01 212.03 B: yeah oh yeah it's not 

210.85 214.02 A: but in eastern kentucky five fifteen's not bad 

213.41 215.04 B: mhm 

214.19 217.38 A: you know unless you work in the coal mine and then you make good money mm 

216.96 226.42 B: so okay this is what i'm thinking okay so that the minimum wage that's something that's on a national level right it's not [mn] you know [mn] state by state oh 

223.77 225.94 A: it's not state wide no 

226.68 230.06 A: and i think it should be like on a sliding scale based on 

231.02 231.88 A: (( the )) 

231.94 233.45 A: what is it they call it 

233.66 235.50 A: oh cost of living 

235.02 237.00 B: oh yeah yeah i think so too 

236.68 237.84 A: yeah 

237.42 242.91 B: so that's true 'cause you know one amount in one state you know could be nothing in another one you know it could be a whole lot 

242.13 248.44 A: that's right that's right i mean somebody you know mis- there's some of the poorer states mississippi and louisiana 

248.48 253.09 A: you might be able to live on five fifteen an hour don't know you can't in kentucky 

250.19 251.78 B: (( [noise] mhm yeah )) 

252.82 255.90 B: [laughter] i know you can't like in the big cities 

253.47 255.68 A: i mean u- unless it's up in the hills 

256.16 257.35 A: well [sigh] 

256.46 257.04 B: (( [laughter] )) 

257.39 260.39 A: not really but you know if you live in the hills you probably can 

260.27 262.01 B: yeah probably so 

261.59 264.83 A: but and there are people that live on a lot less in the hills 

264.26 265.55 B: oh yeah i know 

265.17 266.25 A: but uh 

266.27 273.02 A: around here i mean you can start at taco belle and and start out at seven dollars an hour at taco belle here 

272.63 273.80 B: oh really 

273.41 274.34 A: yeah 

274.37 275.44 B: (( mm )) 

275.15 279.12 A: and [laughter] y- you know i'm thinking heck i can say taco belle you know [noise] 

279.12 280.73 B: [laughter] yeah i know huh 

280.73 284.07 A: seven dollars an hour and all the tacos you can throw down so 

283.18 285.33 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

285.29 286.42 A: (( i don't know )) 

286.08 287.39 B: oh right 

286.47 288.92 A: and i'm sure it's expensive in huston mhm 

288.54 293.52 B: yeah it is it like goes through its phases but lately you know it is and plus 

293.58 297.47 B: and i know that right you know is just as high anyway 

297.70 305.88 B: and because i stopped working in um december or really i was going on maternity leave but um i was w- doing contract work at enron 

305.56 306.47 A: uh-huh 

306.01 308.10 B: and so they just like let me go 

307.67 311.63 A: oh yeah yeah well congratulations on the baby anyway [sigh] 

308.67 309.71 B: and so 

310.37 316.43 B: [laughter] thank you oh i was feeding her right now i was like who is it calling so late [laughter] [laughter] 

314.22 319.00 A: i know [laughter] i know i'm running for the phone and my son's sound asleep 

319.28 327.33 A: but uh yeah i i just i you know when you think about five fifteen an hour and then you think of how high insurance is 

326.63 329.37 B: (( [laughter] oh yeah mhm )) 

327.82 330.17 A: especially when you've got children like we do 

329.81 331.29 B: right mhm 

330.76 332.24 A: there's no way mhm 

331.64 343.78 B: uh there's no way 'cause see i found out the you know the hard way because when i was young i had contract work but you know they had insurance offered but it was like real crummy so i was trying to you know go get it on my own and those rates 

342.76 343.34 A: (( phew )) 

343.99 346.40 B: you know anyone that has those rates 

345.38 347.63 A: i know it they're higher than a cat's back 

347.34 349.17 B: mhm 

348.59 352.81 A: i know i'm lucky i have insurance through my husband's work but it 

352.00 353.50 B: oh yeah that's perfect 

353.25 359.43 A: yeah but if if it had to come out of a five dollar paycheck i couldn't do it there's no way i'd go under 

353.98 355.44 B: mhm 

357.45 359.77 B: mhm i know there's no way 

360.22 362.26 A: yeah i i just don't see how 

362.41 367.96 A: i mean y- heck you can't even plant you can't even grow your own food and still make it on that i don't think but 

366.63 370.08 B: mhm i don't think so either that is extremely low 

369.74 372.81 A: i mean i you know [laughter] we don't make 

372.86 376.64 A: near that little and and i still cut coupons and 

375.99 378.00 B: me too mhm 

377.18 378.88 A: and everything i can do 

378.62 380.00 B: right i know 

379.58 382.22 A: [laughter] that's why i'm doing this survey you know 

381.87 384.78 B: [laughter] i know did you see it on the message boards 

384.73 387.46 A: yeah i did i saw it on fishing for deals 

387.75 389.89 B: oh okay i never heard of that one before 

389.29 391.98 A: oh it's a good one you'll have to go check it out

395.53 396.67 B: okay 

396.53 405.20 A: so if you go please introduce yourself and join in it you'll love it i have saved so much money on that board 

401.32 403.09 B: oh okay i sure will 

404.62 407.59 B: oh yeah i know the one i'm wi- uh yes 'cause they 

407.72 412.23 B: they're real good about t- letting you know what deals are going on what discounts 

410.28 411.41 A: yeah 

411.47 415.05 A: i know it and codes special codes and everything 

412.48 413.09 B: [laughter] 

414.00 415.89 B: yeah [laughter] 

415.31 419.15 A: but i- if i didn't do that heck we wouldn't make it i mean 

419.09 421.24 B: yes like every little bit helps 

420.70 423.01 A: it does it does 

423.07 426.71 A: and i know that you know some people can't make it but i don't 

426.51 428.90 B: i don't think i know i couldn't 

426.83 428.21 A: i think president 

428.32 432.29 A: i i couldn't either i think president bush is really trying hard 

431.69 433.20 B: mhm 

432.56 434.84 A: and he's doing his very best 

434.24 435.56 B: yes he is 

435.07 446.06 A: and by the way go texas [laughter] i'm such a bush fan [laughter] i just love that man and i think he's trying so hard but i just don't think that's enough yeah 

437.70 438.30 B: (( [laughter] )) 

445.68 452.41 B: [laughter] yeah that's what i hear people saying you know there's more that he could do and especially you know with the war and stuff 

452.76 462.22 A: i think of instead of instead of subsidizing things like welfare which is a good thing if you need it it's a wonderful thing when it's not being abused 

458.85 460.05 B: yeah right 

460.29 461.14 B: right 

461.57 464.52 B: abused mhm and so many people do that 

463.85 473.21 A: and so many do but instead of subsidizing that why don't you hike up the minimum wage and then subsidize the employers that have to pay it 

465.08 466.55 B: mhm 

472.61 475.00 B: right mhm that's a good idea 

474.37 476.01 A: you know i mean [sigh] 

476.81 477.95 A: help out the 

476.94 480.57 B: because you know i never thought thought about it you know from their perspective 

480.24 481.20 A: yeah 

480.77 487.95 B: and just to think i- even if they have like a couple of uh uh employees you know that that all adds up 'cause you know you have to take it out [mn] like a 

487.96 493.87 B: a lot of things out on 'em and stuff and you know especially if you're a small business then you won't be able to afford it 

489.78 490.87 A: it does 

491.72 492.84 A: then you gotta have 

493.03 496.82 A: that's right you've gotta have work comp and you've gotta have all this stuff 

496.35 498.00 B: mhm 

497.05 499.07 A: and then you know they go they 

499.50 500.27 A: (( i mean )) 

500.35 503.63 A: [mn] [sigh] i don't it's it's a true catch twenty two 

503.55 506.03 B: right mhm it is 

503.96 505.55 A: it really is 

506.00 512.73 A: i mean i have been trying to start my own business for a long time now and i there's no way i could afford to hire an employee 

512.23 517.25 B: yeah 'cause um we were researching that too one time because you know we were trying to figure out you know 

517.04 528.66 B: how much you know exactly it would be and then and plus there like there's so many laws and stuff involved so many you know regulations you have to go by and then plus you know you gotta you know pay 'em and stuff you know then if you're not making any money you 

522.72 523.44 A: hm 

529.43 530.59 A: exactly 

530.35 532.49 B: (( know then how are you gonna pay them )) 

532.17 541.90 A: i know it a- a- and you're taking money out of your own mouth to pay your employees well that's all well and good but the whole reason to start your own business is to make money 

538.73 542.89 B: mhm to make money right [laughter] 

542.64 545.67 A: and [sigh] it's it's just a vicious cycle 

545.48 546.77 B: yes it is 

546.55 549.32 A: and that's why i'm so big on education 

548.87 550.40 B: mhm i am too 

550.41 551.31 A: man 

550.91 556.39 B: that's what my parents well you know always told us go to school mhm and get it 

552.94 554.95 A: yeah get that education 

555.82 559.46 A: yeah uh and th- these days there's no excuse not to that's 

558.97 566.60 B: mm mm there sure isn't there sure isn't because i mean the the [mn] you know if you wanna go to college you know there there's a way for you to go 

566.29 569.36 A: right yeah that's right there's always a way i 

568.83 571.15 B: mhm there sure is 

570.01 573.87 A: mean i worked my way through [laughter] you know i didn't quite finish 

571.93 581.86 B: yeah and that's what i mean the majority of people do you know w- we don't get scholarships you know or all of that you know we have to you know work our way through or bum off our parents [laughter] 

575.11 575.82 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

581.04 582.12 A: that's right 

582.00 582.59 B: (( [laughter] )) 

582.52 584.88 A: [laughter] that's what we're there for isn't it 

584.28 585.29 B: (( yes )) 

585.08 587.75 A: especially coming up on mother's day it's good to remember 

587.00 592.35 B: mhm i thought i'm gonna relax i don't wanna do anything [laughter] 

589.93 591.02 A: that's right 

591.99 597.36 A: i told my son all our he's four or he'll be four on monday the day after mother's day 

596.97 597.80 B: [laughter] 

597.76 599.89 A: and i told him i said all i want for mother's
