6.80 10.03 B: hi [cough] so we're talking about minimum wage huh 

9.74 14.53 A: yeah you know what i got this call earlier and then there wasn't ever a person that came on 

15.06 16.06 B: oh really 

15.64 17.73 A: yeah it's weird oh um 

17.05 19.10 B: (( yeah it's an interesting uh system )) 

18.15 20.61 A: (( [noise] )) 

19.97 22.67 B: so um how do you feel about minimum wage 

22.77 24.19 A: (( hold on )) 

25.88 27.92 A: (( a second i gotta switch phones )) 

28.88 29.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

34.04 34.89 A: hello 

34.92 35.78 B: hello 

35.61 36.34 A: hi 

36.65 37.41 B: hello 

36.77 37.72 A: okay 

38.16 39.08 A: well 

39.11 45.43 A: um [noise] okay i made this whole conversation earlier so basically it just didn't even count right 

45.47 48.01 B: right i wo- it might i don't know 

46.07 47.15 A: [laughter] 

48.42 52.05 A: [laughter] okay well anyway um 

52.58 57.16 A: uh minimum wage at five fifteen do you know what the ol- the old minimum wage was 

58.05 61.68 B: um i don't i don't know exactly i think it was four 

62.60 65.74 B: i think four fifty four seventy five maybe i think um 

64.66 66.43 A: oh okay 

66.58 67.72 A: well 

67.20 70.31 B: they're raising it i thought it was even higher than that actually 

69.24 73.90 A: yeah i thought it was already higher than five fifteen that's why you know it was kinda confusing 

72.74 76.72 B: so did i do you live in in the west or somewhere i live in 

75.51 77.45 A: we live in california 

76.81 79.79 B: yeah me too and i thought it was yeah that's what i was thinking 

79.53 83.55 A: you know so i thought that yeah it was already higher than five fifteen 

83.72 87.71 B: exactly so um i well yeah my feeling on it is 

88.41 93.13 B: i i don't mind a minimum wage at all five fifteen that seems low i think 

92.21 96.01 A: yeah it does seem low to me and i just assumed that 

94.30 95.26 B: i think it's 

95.46 100.06 B: like seven fifty and i thought it was seven fifty in california until i thought it was high 

98.16 98.85 A: [laughter] 

99.70 106.50 A: no no no no no i know it's not as high you know i knew it wasn't high as high as that but i did think it was higher than five fifteen 

106.60 111.85 A: so if it isn't up to there then i don't have a problem with it being raised to five fifteen 

112.31 113.14 A: um 

112.55 116.03 B: yeah five fifteen not at all i i yeah i would agree 

116.23 127.83 B: i mean five fifteen seems um seems though the only problem i have with with a minimum wage and at five fifteen it doesn't i don't have a problem at all at six fifteen at seven fifteen i might have a problem but 

127.78 131.80 A: well i could see it being a problem for you know business owners though 

130.46 131.21 B: right 

131.82 137.92 B: right exactly that's that's that's the problem for me too is is i'm college educated and i'm actually in the 

137.87 148.23 B: job market right now looking uh for a new position and it with a high minimum wage it's just difficult for me due to the fact that they get higher you know someone's that uneducated 

139.43 140.43 A: mhm 

148.63 151.53 B: or educated from almost the same you know 

151.55 153.12 B: minimum wage if it 

153.19 163.72 B: goes to that aside you know that because the b- business owners have to drop off someone and they can't drop off from the bottom because there's been a minimum wage now so they drop off middle management and that's you know that's where 

160.38 161.27 A: right 

163.82 168.96 B: the college educated and y- you know those are the jobs that are lost that is the only concern i have in the long run 

168.80 175.32 A: yeah i i'm wondering you know because minimum wage usually those jobs are more for 

169.17 171.06 B: but that's not a problem 

175.54 182.81 A: i would think um you know the more like the factory places and some of those really beginning 

183.02 185.71 A: stores i don't i don't think 

183.52 186.13 B: right exactly the retail and 

186.54 188.85 A: yeah but i think that that 

186.69 196.30 B: right right at five at five fifteen yeah not not a problem that's what i mean at at eight fifteen that i'm just saying i'm saying if it ever it was at eight fifteen 

190.21 191.02 A: yeah 

191.74 192.56 A: yeah 

196.94 201.11 B: if it was then i could see it being a problem at some point because 

201.16 207.09 B: it's just getting too high and they're dropping off middle i mean they have to lay off somebody to head off 

202.84 203.63 A: right 

206.10 210.69 A: right well the thing is they end up increasing their prices to us 

207.22 208.05 B: their 

210.47 218.73 B: exactly and then we suffer in the long run as consumers also so that's the only thing with minimum wage that i have a problem with 

217.13 218.22 A: (( yeah )) 

218.66 227.45 A: yeah i'm not too sure i know they have tiers they used to have tiers if you were under sixteen there was uh one minimum wage wage rate and then um 

227.82 234.02 A: you know after that they went to regular minimum wage and i i don't know if it'd be fair to say 

233.09 234.44 B: right right 

234.21 235.11 A: um 

235.12 237.99 A: you know have another tier for 

237.44 238.32 B: right 

238.24 240.77 A: you know teen workers [laughter] or something 

241.04 242.72 B: (( yeah because i mean yeah )) 

241.24 248.59 A: i know they won't like it but i was thinking if you were working full time at minimum wage then you really do need an increase 

246.78 248.18 B: yeah exactly yeah 

248.54 250.00 B: that's that's a good point 

248.73 249.75 A: because 

249.88 257.79 A: i could see people that you know that if they can't get any other job and they actually get a job that is strictly minimum wage 

250.04 250.89 B: because 

258.25 262.13 A: i don't think in california they could live on that you know how 

261.13 264.45 B: yeah exactly yeah it's it's tough in california 

262.46 263.42 A: yeah 

264.60 274.26 B: where we live but at the same time if if uh it's not that tough to get a job that's paying ten or twelve dollars an hour in california 

274.62 276.05 B: (( you know i mean )) 

274.70 281.21 A: i i think it kind yeah but i think it kind of depends i know the k- kids that um i have um 

281.61 287.97 A: teenagers and i know that um even if they start working at in and out or carls junior 

283.00 283.77 B: mhm 

287.78 288.62 B: right 

288.01 292.32 A: i think they start at around eight dollars you know so 

290.56 291.61 B: right 

292.84 301.14 B: which yeah you know you can't live off that but a teen- teenager you can sure you know living living at home with mummy and daddy then that's probably not a big problem 

294.41 296.23 A: no you can't live off that 

299.84 311.68 A: no that's not bad but i know there's people out there that you know that's the job that they get you know so i don't know if you know if you're totally unskilled you know say that you're 

305.24 306.59 B: right exactly 

312.15 314.76 A: you know just you don't have 

314.54 315.83 B: (( right you don't )) 

315.03 319.05 A: anything [laughter] then i think that some of those people 

319.22 322.59 A: you know need some kind of protection i suppose but 

321.90 333.69 B: have anything yeah they could have a the problem the problem though where we live especially where we live in in you know in big cities like like los angeles or or even orange county is that 

333.73 336.22 B: we have some people that would take advantage of that you know 

336.76 337.78 A: yeah 

336.85 341.93 B: it would be tough it would be tough to regulate such a system i mean i would agree with it on on paper but the problem is 

342.03 350.08 B: to regulate a system like that would ch- i mean could you imagine how many people would would claim that they have no skills just to get whatever it is eight dollars an hour 

347.62 348.43 A: right 

349.84 351.07 A: right 

350.44 359.87 B: versus six or ten dollars an hour versus eight you know that's what tough it's tough but i mean that's i guess that's the uh law makers and the p- politicians that's sort of a tough job 

353.08 353.92 A: right 

358.47 359.52 A: yeah 

359.80 365.75 A: i suppose that's the way it is i guess you've gotta better go and get something that gets you a better job 

361.72 363.96 B: (( yes that's just the exactly )) 

365.59 366.72 B: exactly 

366.18 372.51 A: you know so i don't i don't know but uh five fifteen that sounds 

373.21 376.25 A: that it should be at least that 

375.56 377.72 B: yeah five fifteen seems like 

377.73 382.33 B: that's if anything that could be that's low in california i'd say that's low 

381.95 384.84 A: yeah i'm not sure who they're even offering that to though 

385.44 390.28 B: that might be you know what it might be i think i think they had a state wide in california which is higher 

390.50 401.70 B: and it's gonna go to i think that's why i thought it was seven seventy five i think it's eventually in in six years or eight years i think it's going to seven seventy five but it's national i think there's a national minimum it's a it's mandatory 

401.66 407.92 B: nationally because there's like in colorado i think minimum wage is like is like two seventy five it's really really low 

407.25 411.65 A: oh okay so this minimum wage you think is just for california 

410.36 413.83 B: it it i think it's a national i i think california i i'm 

414.08 418.49 B: almost positive that we're a lot higher than that or at least a dollar higher than that 

417.81 420.09 A: yeah i thought we were already in the sixes 

419.78 420.85 B: yeah 

420.82 421.92 A: so 

420.89 425.98 B: but and i can remember going to seven seventy five i believe if i remember 

426.37 428.20 B: i remember we voted on it 

426.38 429.09 A: you really think it's that high seven something 

428.72 443.25 B: not no i don't think it's yet i think in that was the thing we voted on and it passed in one of our elections i think and i remember going to seven seventy five at some point maybe in six year it's it's it's queued up every every three two years it goes up a quarter or something 

439.31 440.44 A: oh okay 

443.25 448.66 B: and it's i think the high point was seven seventy five in two thousand and ten maybe i i was 

446.18 447.37 A: (( oh )) 

448.49 450.19 A: oh okay that makes sense 

449.34 456.46 B: i could be that might maybe maybe the initiative didn't pass but i'm pretty sure that this is a nation- what they're talking about is a national uh minimum wage 

455.38 457.33 A: oh okay 

456.64 470.11 B: for everyone which i which i don't see a problem is but the thing is we live in california so we don't see the prob- we don't see maybe it's tough for for um business owners like restaurants back in you know colorado maybe they don't get the business that we get so they have to have a 

470.38 471.99 B: lower minimum wage 

470.50 474.26 A: they have to have a lower minimum wage because they have lower cost of living maybe 

474.18 481.20 B: right but which doesn't you know we don't even know i mean for us it's like wow we need we need at least ten dollars [laughter] 

480.72 490.71 A: yeah yeah [laughter] because i was yeah actually i was really surprised 'cause this kid uh really you know just one of my neighbors just got out of high school and then 

481.48 483.77 B: (( but you know the lowest person but )) 

491.09 504.26 A: you know went to work at in and out and you know carls junior and places like that but um yeah it was something like eight he got eight something but i know over at mervyn's that's where he's working now and he's getting six seventy five 

504.52 505.38 B: [noise] wow 

505.38 506.72 A: you know so 

507.45 511.53 B: [noise] yeah it's interesting um 

509.65 512.75 A: that's kind of kind of strange i think 

512.76 517.47 B: it's a strange it's more strange i guess they just do it on supply and demand i imagine 

518.50 519.28 B: (( it is )) 

518.65 520.10 A: yeah 

519.58 521.39 B: probably how they do it 

521.82 523.51 B: but i guess uh 

521.85 523.23 A: (( they get the uniform )) 

523.77 527.18 B: we've pretty much covered all almost all the topics right [laughter] 

526.25 530.42 A: yeah i don't you know i mean there wasn't a whole 

530.75 531.81 A: um 

533.39 535.45 A: lot more i think that this 

535.47 539.84 A: [laughter] you could talk about either you're for or against it but i 

539.99 545.71 A: i assume that this would eventually end up on a ballot if this is what it's going for the 

545.71 558.49 A: for well i don't know how they could do it then because you know if there's national wide i don't know how they could well yeah because every every state's gonna pass their own 

545.95 548.39 B: (( yeah i imagine )) 

558.78 562.47 B: yeah i i guess there's probably a federal el- um 

562.65 565.64 B: i don't know everyone will vote on it i guess i'm not sure 

565.96 567.90 B: how it will be passed but i you know 

568.43 572.92 B: i think we're we're uh well we're supporting it [laughter] 

572.98 575.70 A: yeah i would think so but you know 

576.08 579.63 A: i i i think there's a lot of other states that 

580.39 581.22 A: (( you know )) 

581.49 584.05 A: would probably end up not supporting it 

584.88 588.06 B: [noise] yeah i'm i'm not sure how it would turn out and 

588.25 589.63 B: but it's not a 

589.99 591.77 B: it's not a problem uh 

591.97 593.80 B: for m- in my eyes at all 

593.85 595.12 B: so i would 

593.94 598.62 A: so so um you're doing this as a part time thing 

599.26 599.89 B: (( yeah i'm just ))
