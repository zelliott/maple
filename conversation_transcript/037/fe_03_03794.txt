159.24 159.67 B: mhm 

161.32 167.89 A: and i didn't really notice it until i had kids and you know they were at the age where they started repeating things and 

168.42 168.80 A: one of 

169.09 170.09 A: we were on 

170.23 175.29 A: listening to the morning a morning show or something and we walked into the doctor's office and my oldest daughter said mommy what 

175.44 176.35 A: genital mean 

177.24 187.23 A: so i thought that was kind of (( )) time to turn off the radio i didn't even really know they said it but she said that that's what they had were talking about and i think it was kind of along the lines 

180.88 181.83 B: right 

187.13 187.59 B: right 

189.07 191.50 A: i don't know has it been close to ten minutes

198.30 198.72 B: d- i- 

199.17 205.13 B: i guess the question in use it's a little obscure i mean did they mean in everyday life or you know in movies or 

204.30 204.68 A: (( )) 

205.49 209.44 A: i have no clue i- and don't understand what they meant by where do you draw the line 

210.69 211.24 B: right 

211.40 212.10 B: i mean 

212.51 213.47 B: i think the line is 

213.84 214.76 B: pretty clear 

215.00 216.81 A: yeah most people know where it is 

217.56 221.35 A: least people you're around (( )) and then if it's not you say hey you know 

221.79 222.39 B: right 

222.24 227.78 A: or take yourself out of that conversation i guess that would be how i'd (( )) i'd remove myself from the conversation
