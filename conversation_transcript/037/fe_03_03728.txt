0.00 1.47 A: (( hi i'm tim )) 

1.25 3.82 B: hi i'm vince from california 

3.57 5.81 A: hi vince i'm in oregon actually 

5.53 7.67 B: yes how is it up there 

7.32 8.60 A: not bad 

8.41 11.63 B: yes this is an interesting topic huh 

11.33 17.34 A: well actually it's it's it's funny because in oregon it's already six fifty for minimum 

16.96 29.16 B: yeah that's i think that's that's that's a fair they call it like the fair wage act down here a- a- and and it's just because ah people can't live much at that you know the federal minimum wage 

29.18 31.71 B: level that was mandated before 

32.00 36.53 A: [lipsmack] true ah um in california it's is it more than six bucks an hour 

36.35 41.81 B: um i believe it's six something it's it's ah i'd have to look at it 

39.95 40.92 A: oh okay 

41.64 52.62 B: but i know there's a living wage initiative um that that was um put through before it it's just that that in general the federal minimum wage as you might know it hasn't kept up with inflation 

53.21 56.37 A: well i've maybe i'll take the opposing view 

56.53 57.59 B: uh-huh 

56.66 60.79 A: 'cause 'cause what i saw when the last increase went through here 

60.87 62.37 A: is um 

60.96 61.96 B: uh-huh 

62.87 77.74 A: um food food prices went up and they blamed it on on shipping [laughter] but it was just like it kind of trickled so once that increase came through the we saw like grocery prices go up um 

68.98 70.07 B: uh-huh 

77.67 82.41 A: then the restaurants raised their prices even the fast food places 

82.45 92.62 A: and so i'm i think that um i agree that maybe you know five bucks is not enough but it but it does it's a- it's almost like 

89.51 91.28 B: mhm 

94.09 101.36 A: [lipsmack] an unfair tax if you will because the the poor guys are only making six bucks an hour anyway you know 

101.41 102.71 B: mhm 

101.53 106.49 A: once everything goes up in in price it's it's basically like you didn't get a raise 

106.75 117.74 B: [lipsmack] ah i- in a way it it is sort of a self feeding thing isn't it when you increase the the the labor cost it increases the product costs and it kind of cycles back around through inflation doesn't it a- 

107.03 107.85 A: but 

117.10 118.40 A: right 

118.02 120.26 B: at least at the lower level 

120.71 125.55 B: you know for people that make m- more money i guess it's not quite maybe as significant 

125.56 131.71 B: in in so much as that the grocery bills and so forth aren't as big a percentage of of that person's 

132.08 134.80 B: ah disposable income 

134.19 137.45 A: correct and so they can absorb it a little bit better 

137.22 138.78 B: (( mhm )) 

138.14 142.61 A: um i don't know how some of the folks get by actually i've 

142.97 149.19 A: ah but i'm on a a fixed salary but at least it's a healthy enough one to to ride out 

143.07 144.85 B: yeah it 

149.11 157.66 B: yeah the same sort of thing here it's it's just i- i- reasonably speaking one must make quite above whatever minimum wage in order to 

158.43 161.83 B: to support oneself at a reasonably comfortable level 

162.62 168.03 B: i i think i think that that that's a salient point um 

168.87 178.40 B: [sigh] i don't know we've never had full employment yet and you know i mean no matter what so on one hand i can i can understand what you're saying and on the other hand it it 

178.81 185.79 B: it seem that sometimes people are paid very low wages so it's it's a difficult topic with no really easy solution 

185.35 186.31 A: (( mhm true )) 

186.33 188.27 B: even in the best of times 

188.07 194.18 A: right now now washington i think has a higher unemployment rate than 

189.43 190.84 B: so i i'm 

194.28 198.78 A: than california does i could be wrong about that that's what i thought i heard on the news 

196.97 197.90 B: i 

198.48 202.65 B: i think you might be right especially with like some of the problems in the aerospace 

202.52 204.87 A: yeah with boeing especially mhm 

204.17 207.84 B: mhm yeah i was thinking of them too particularly 

208.15 209.37 B: um 

209.31 217.66 A: there is some boeing places in california but but you know you got so many other employers that that it's probably 

212.36 213.39 B: yes 

216.39 224.64 B: we had a very large ah it was mcdonald douglas that was a- as you recall it was absorbed by boeing but they shut that down a few years ago when they built the 

219.60 220.45 A: right 

223.79 225.50 A: oh that's right okay 

224.71 232.90 B: m._d. eleven or the l. ten eleven but that's been totally absorbed and they closed that big plant in is in downey it was a big plant 

233.23 239.88 B: um but southern california just has in particular has such a diversification particularly in service 

240.87 242.67 B: (( and )) 

241.65 249.60 A: yeah and and high tech there seems to be a a good high tech especially in the bay area and and even san diego 

243.23 245.64 B: ah and mhm 

246.38 250.16 B: oh the bay area that's yeah and they got hit harder 

250.45 251.48 A: true 

252.09 257.70 B: now is oregon's economy pretty diversified i know you have a lot of ah timber industry 

256.90 260.71 A: well now the timber's actually down because of all the um 

260.80 264.51 A: the new regulations and it's kind of funny 'cause 

264.65 269.70 A: um a lot of timber workers would still be out of the bus- out of a job 

269.69 270.73 B: uh-huh 

269.71 277.41 A: ah 'cause about the same time these automated tools if you will these big things that like 

277.54 290.79 A: can process the the raw logs faster and better i saw a special on it were coming in to play about that same time so i think no matter what we would have lost a lot of jobs anyway 

282.50 283.72 B: mhm 

285.52 286.54 B: mhm 

290.81 291.91 B: yes 

291.21 293.71 A: but it was just bad timing to 

294.04 298.44 A: um the other thing is canada will ship 

299.01 310.91 A: ah wood and they'll actually subsidize it where their wood's cheaper and so you know there's a lot of pressure so i think timber industry in general in oregon probably washington too is pretty 

302.09 303.30 B: wow 

309.78 311.03 B: mhm 

310.87 319.43 A: pretty much a hurting and even high tech is hurting i think intel's probably the one of few doing well [noise] 

318.52 322.49 B: yes i i know people who are in the high tech industry and it's just ah 

322.73 329.21 B: it's horrible for them it used to be good but we've been out this country's been out sourcing the jobs to other countries a lot 

328.61 332.20 A: oh okay do you know about the h. one b. program 

332.08 333.55 B: of course 

333.15 337.16 A: okay well that's that's another bugaboo that [laughter] 

337.29 339.02 A: i i don't agree with 

339.43 340.30 A: how they 

339.49 343.41 B: yeah how y- yeah the immigration laws here are pretty lax 

343.04 344.53 A: right 

343.82 350.24 B: i mean that's to say the least tha- that'd be good another good topic for the fisher people i'm sure it's probably on their list 

348.31 349.33 A: true 

350.70 353.78 A: so ah that that to me is like 

353.93 355.37 A: somewhere to 

355.45 362.46 A: that's worse than the minimum wage 'cause now it's taking potential jobs and giving them to non u._s. people 

362.64 368.18 B: yeah at least with the minimum wage you're looking out for the citizens or least permanent residents in this case now you have 

369.08 374.31 B: a ah unfortunately ah you're giving jobs to foreigners that could be given to americans that's true 

373.42 374.63 A: right 

374.59 379.05 B: and that's that's a frustrating thing when they see politicians back that up 

378.52 383.81 A: yeah and they keep up they're wanting to up the limit even though they never filled all the positions 

383.90 387.55 A: that they had before [laughter] it just blows my mind 

385.70 392.34 B: isn't that amazing i- it's quite amazing 'c- i- i- you get some of that reverse politics here in the u._s. 

392.46 399.15 B: you know w- where you actually have interest within the country working against it the interests of the constituents within that country 

398.59 399.93 A: (( mhm right )) 

399.41 402.71 B: ah i don't think you can see that in in any other country like this 

402.66 405.05 A: yeah it's just it seems like 

405.49 409.35 A: yeah we're shooting ourselves in the foot and then [laughter] 

408.59 409.60 B: mhm 

410.05 418.09 B: and and i know we're kind of moving off topic but i'm for ah for like immigration at least major controls off on it 

417.11 418.61 A: (( yeah right i mm )) 

418.56 425.53 B: and i i think with that maybe if we had more of that then you could pay workers more you know you had more jobs for americans 

425.39 426.26 A: true 

426.23 427.34 B: (( and you keep )) 

427.43 428.54 A: go ahead 

427.66 431.07 B: hm you keep more money in house it's better 

430.85 434.15 A: right i was just gonna make a joke about france 

433.97 435.18 B: uh-huh 

434.83 443.21 A: oh yeah we're we don't want to go against ah the iraq people and it turns out you know they're getting a good chunk of their financial 

443.53 444.49 A: um 

443.89 445.51 B: oh yeah 

444.61 456.56 A: through through whatever they were trading for the oil and it's like ah okay [laughter] but at least you know they're not shooting theirselves in the foot like americans do we we spent how much 

447.26 448.51 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

453.04 454.58 B: yeah hey hey 

456.72 464.64 A: and i i'm for you know i'm all for our soldiers but it was probably final estimates aren't aren't due out but 

465.04 467.65 A: um a billion dollars on the war 

467.85 469.28 A: maybe even more 

467.96 476.58 B: oh yeah yeah we had to spend a lot you know and and it's because yeah we had to undo a lot of our own work and that and ah 

477.86 481.74 B: and finish the job that wasn't done you know twelve years ago 

481.05 483.29 A: yeah a decade ago yeah 

482.68 488.93 B: and that that's frustrating and i- it's great a great job they did the soldiers it's just it's frustrating that they had to go in twice 

488.52 490.85 A: right uh-huh 

489.90 495.00 B: but finally it's it looks like it's it's coming to a at least some sort of 

495.08 496.41 B: resolution 

496.11 502.61 A: right which is which is real nice after all of pseudo resolutions we've had [laughter] in the past 

499.39 500.45 B: mhm 

501.83 505.44 B: oh yeah so how'd you find out about fisher 

505.09 510.43 A: ah i read some of the online forums and i saw it posted there 

508.68 509.53 B: uh-huh 

510.18 514.09 B: i think i saw it in fat wallet or one of those other ones you know 

513.78 517.71 A: fat wallet yeah i haven't been there as often but yeah that's a good one 

515.06 516.07 B: yeah 

517.72 518.74 B: mhm 

517.78 520.47 A: i think big big forums is where i saw it 

520.56 522.07 B: it's called big big forum 

520.69 521.75 A: there's a cool 

521.84 531.79 A: yeah a cool site called volition dot com yeah they're great they're really i know the guy i've met virtually met the guy that owns it and he's a really nice guy 

524.18 525.88 B: yes i've heard of them ah 

531.49 532.88 B: they pay too 

533.52 539.56 A: well he he kinda lists all these other opportunities he doesn't host any surveys himself 

539.23 544.87 B: mhm a lot of people that are making minimum wage should should take advantage of things like fisher it's a great 

544.55 545.83 A: right 

545.14 549.36 B: yeah it's a great way to contribute i guess it's a research project right 

548.78 550.04 A: exactly 

549.79 552.31 B: and i i'm not sure how long it's ongoing 

552.64 554.03 B: but i figure that if 

552.82 564.30 A: usually usually they run for [noise] i i was with one in the u- university of oregon and it's it's however long the f- the funding or if they've finished the project so maybe a year sometimes two 

564.15 569.06 B: and you can make ah is it three calls a month or is it three calls per i thought it was three calls total 

568.76 578.26 A: [noise] ah that will i wasn't clear on but it sounds like ah you can call the number and maybe even get more i haven't done that yet i think you're my third call 

578.33 579.50 B: uh-huh 

578.90 582.95 A: ah in about two months or so since i signed up 

581.55 583.45 B: it's kinda fun you know 

583.18 584.80 A: it's different yeah [noise] 

584.48 593.12 B: and and it's i think it's a good thing for this country to have a this dialog and it's interesting i guess they're a- they're not analyzing our topics so much as maybe our conversational styles 

592.61 597.30 A: right and how how we say things and break in and yeah 

596.25 599.89 B: a- a- and this this this this minimum wage thing or whatever the topic of the day
