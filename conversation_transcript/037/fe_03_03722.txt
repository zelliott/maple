161.97 164.56 B: i like i said i can't imagine i mean

207.36 216.98 B: i guess like nationally if you wanna join the s- one of the like the service army navy you know they have some good incentive programs and if there were more things like that that 

217.16 223.61 B: attached along with minimum wage it would probably be a little bit more beneficial 'cause you're right like that's an incentive self improvement program 

223.52 224.26 A: (( maybe )) 

223.67 226.13 B: but i just don't think there's 

226.18 229.31 B: that those types of things readily available 

229.68 231.41 B: i mean a- at least not 

231.42 233.04 B: that i've heard of in

274.04 274.98 A: (( hours )) 

275.21 277.59 A: (( an forty hours a week and )) 

277.63 284.99 A: (( like i said most likely you'll probably be working maybe twenty thirty hours a week at minimum wage mhm you're correct yeah )) 

285.15 290.86 B: right and in addition to that like the stigma that society has placed on you know working 

285.20 286.61 A: (( that's true )) 

290.89 303.84 B: only for minimum wage and and on top of that working for fast food restaurant i'm sure to them like if they have a family and you know they're in their thirties or forties it's a little bit humiliating to them and they're working for such a low amount of money 

304.25 305.30 A: i mean 

304.36 305.14 B: (( i mean )) 

305.52 307.33 A: (( yeah correct 'cause i mean being ))

334.32 336.26 A: (( and you and you )) 

336.35 339.71 A: (( get i mean even if they do get )) 

340.15 345.58 A: (( it weekly or whatever it is not you know once a month )) 

342.68 343.59 B: right 

345.93 347.92 A: (( you know like i )) 

348.01 353.34 B: right and maybe i mean if if minimum wage had some type of 

348.25 348.98 A: (( said it's )) 

353.20 357.16 B: addendum to it where like you could they would have benefits i mean 

356.99 371.46 B: even something like that would be helpful but most minimum wave jo- wage jobs that's what they are is just the salary i mean they don't offer any other type of bonus on top of that no you know no insurance or i mean all those things are 

365.50 366.27 A: like 

369.64 370.47 A: (( you know th- )) 

371.68 382.38 A: (( they should basically th- th- [mn] they every company should have a way to maneuver where they can pay this one person for )) 

371.72 373.00 B: are important 

382.77 388.19 B: yeah exactly definitely the m- yeah 'cause the minimum wage wage shops i mean they don't wanna 

383.12 383.93 A: (( doing )) 

388.26 391.32 B: there's just not the hours available and they have you know 

391.67 394.15 B: too many employees if you wanted to work 

394.21 400.11 B: you know the forty hours a week and tha- a lot of times like my friends when i was in high school i i had a 

400.62 410.24 B: i had a minimum wage job but i was a waitress so i got tips so that helped me a little bit but a lotta the um people were complaining i'm not getting enough hours and that would their 

410.35 413.49 B: mostly their reasons for quitting is they just 

413.51 416.68 B: they weren't making enough money and i'm like 

416.97 418.87 B: but that's bad [sigh]

418.71 420.98 A: (( you know at something more )) 

421.70 424.97 A: (( you know i think it should be like )) 

425.20 429.43 A: (( almost eight dollars you know seven fifty or ))

438.76 440.50 A: (( if it were for maybe )) 

440.89 441.83 A: something 

441.75 443.72 B: yeah i i agree i mean 

444.38 450.97 B: for me since i'm a teacher i think to myself you know i guess i can spare the five dollars that's not that much money but 

451.09 456.14 B: a minimum wage person for myself thinking that's a whole hour of their wages is 

456.18 458.10 B: i mean it's so insufficient 

458.83 460.53 B: it's so insufficient 

460.54 463.12 A: (( that you were beginning maybe )) 

463.33 466.18 A: (( it was a beg- a beginning wage for )) 

466.20 467.51 A: (( like you know a thirty day ))

469.34 470.18 B: right 

470.14 470.85 A: (( then )) 

471.71 478.24 A: (( after that then you would you know get the certain amount of you know money maybe it would be eight dollars )) 

478.33 483.97 A: (( or whatever but to just start off at you know )) 

484.10 485.39 A: (( minimum wage )) 

487.41 489.44 A: (( and then from there go )) 

490.31 491.23 B: yeah i mean 

492.12 494.24 B: [sigh] i'm just wonder- i mean

501.90 503.67 B: paying minimum wage 

503.34 504.22 A: (( from )) 

504.45 505.34 B: i mean 

506.10 515.10 A: (( a quarter to another quarter you know it i mean it's it's ridiculous especially like i say these )) 

511.40 512.28 B: uh-huh 

515.37 516.26 A: (( companies )) 

516.14 517.04 B: right 

516.54 518.02 A: (( that have )) 

518.83 519.63 A: (( so )) 

520.34 521.27 A: (( much )) 

523.99 527.00 A: (( money you know but they don't like in the )) 

527.30 530.24 A: (( fir- as far as minimum wage ))

540.61 541.56 B: right 

550.90 553.60 A: do they m- i don't think so i think it's basically 

553.77 559.95 A: just for quotas and you know so you won't try to get someone for 

560.13 565.94 A: less try to give somebody four dollars an hour but yeah i mean 

563.57 564.52 B: right 

566.45 571.34 A: like i said if i mean if it were like maybe an intro wage 

571.39 582.39 A: for a certain amount of time but once you've started minimum wage y- y- i mean you don't have to you know most people end up leaving you know they end up leaving that job looking for 

579.84 580.77 B: right 

582.26 591.00 A: you know something better and um that's what makes it what makes them allowed to to do that i mean i remember it wasn't that long ago
