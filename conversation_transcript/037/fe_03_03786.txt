0.43 1.56 A: hello 

1.31 2.55 B: hello 

2.21 4.20 A: hi my name is carolyn 

3.90 6.87 B: and my name's larry how are you today carolyn 

5.77 7.76 A: i'm good how are you larry 

7.12 9.50 B: pretty good 

8.61 10.82 A: how do you feel about this topic 

10.98 20.67 B: well i feel like that uh humor uh do the body good med- like a medicine but i really do think that uh lines can be crossed 

20.10 21.40 A: mhm 

20.80 32.98 B: and uh i think that uh when people go make a humor of uh tragedy uh you know especially something that hits close to home and stuff like that t- that's where the lines start to be crossed 

32.29 46.65 A: mhm i agree um i i i didn't used to think that i had a a low tolerance for bad taste humor but lately um on my computer i've been getting 

46.79 47.73 A: uh 

47.66 62.50 A: jokes from a co-worker who i didn't know very well and she started sending me jokes every now and then and and they keep getting worse and worse you know jokes they they and it's real hard to tell whether 

62.67 73.53 A: what to do about it i mean that's my problem with her you know she's uh she's not she doesn't work with me in the office every day she works uh we work in different lo- different states you know 

73.60 81.55 A: and she's sending me things that i don't think are funny but i don't want to offend her by saying they're not funny or you know that they offend me i 

81.80 82.76 B: mhm 

81.88 83.68 A: don't quite know how to deal with that 

83.37 90.33 B: well i i i i think that uh if you want to tolerate it that that would be entirely up to you 

90.27 104.82 B: but if you're intolerant of it then i i think that you can intelligently um let it be known exactly what your views about uh the way you feel about that type of humor and and maybe even give a personal explanation as to why 

104.47 105.47 A: mhm 

104.83 109.70 B: and i think that if they're an intelligent and mature person then they should understand 

109.01 119.17 A: mhm well it's getting a little political and i think that's that's where it's starting to offend me um because we were coworkers we 

119.28 120.41 A: we didn't use 

120.42 130.27 A: our our conversations were primarily about the things we work with you know and occasionally there would be something about sports or something like that that we would throw in or our families but 

130.28 135.26 A: um i think the international situation has brought up some sit- some uh 

135.45 142.09 A: things that that and she's sending me things that clearly she thinks are funny and i think they're very inappropriate 

142.11 149.65 A: um i think we're supposed to say how do you how do you draw the line between what's acceptable and what's in bad taste i don't know 

148.51 158.68 B: well probably the only way to draw the line is to do exactly that and and and that is draw the line by letting someone know when they've crossed the line 

156.20 157.14 A: mhm 

158.34 159.38 A: mhm 

158.78 173.43 B: and you you don't have to be a a total butt about the way you do it you know but you you can let your feelings be known and some people they get started and they really don't know when to stop 

163.78 165.44 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

167.89 168.81 A: mhm 

173.46 177.64 B: you know they think that the further they go with it the funnier that it gets 

177.15 178.54 A: mhm 

178.09 188.74 B: and uh so yeah if if if something uh really really insulted me or offended me or something that that was just totally unparallel uh 

188.69 193.54 B: to humor with me then i would have to let it be known because 

193.55 196.79 B: you know a lot of times people say things 

196.72 210.17 B: that they may be able to say to one person which may very well be funny but but then again too they may s- say something to another individual who has had to have dealt with this uh particular subject 

200.45 201.51 A: (( right mhm )) 

210.32 221.92 B: in their life in their family on their job where or however and it hits a note with them where it wouldn't hit a note with another so therefore no one's gonna know how you feel unless you tell 

221.35 223.65 A: right i think that's a good point too because 

223.49 238.20 A: i can see from the emails that she sends me i see that there's a wide distribution list and a lot of the people's names i recognize as family members and i think they know each other well enough to know that it's okay to exchange this stuff within their circle but 

238.02 251.03 A: because she's widened her circle to include people that she doesn't really know well on a personal level it's um she's she's really i think o- on thin ice try- sharing things with me that um 

251.71 255.17 A: if i were her i wouldn't be doing that you know i really only 

255.19 261.24 A: distribute things that i think are funny to people that i'm pretty sure will share my sense of humor 

259.75 269.02 B: them well you know there's also a very thin line between in- intelligence you know uh book smart and a lack of common sense 

268.45 269.89 A: (( mhm right )) 

269.20 273.08 B: and and that that comes into play in that quite often too 

272.49 273.82 A: mhm 

273.13 276.46 B: uh some some people who who you know like they 

276.56 284.18 B: they they could give you the the formula for how to you know uh make rocket fuel but they wouldn't know how to climb the ladder to get in 

281.67 282.61 A: [laughter] 

283.74 284.99 A: uh-huh right 

284.35 295.57 B: and and so you know i some sometimes i mean you know you might strike a note with someone who doesn't make these realizations and um make them see something from a different perspective 

295.00 296.10 A: mhm 

295.45 301.16 B: and it might come right out of humor and into mhm you know and make 'em think 

300.57 302.20 A: mhm right 

301.57 305.12 B: you never know how it might strike someone you know but uh 

303.78 304.76 A: mhm 

304.99 318.01 B: yeah people are often times very considerate inconsiderate of other people's feelings because they don't know all the issues they they don't know all of you know what might be going on in this person's life 

317.46 320.71 A: right i used to think that jokes about 

320.55 334.15 A: older people were funny or people you know actually one thing that this woman and i share are jokes about we're both um i'm in my fifties she's in her sixties we're sharing stories about losing our memory and forgetting things but 

334.11 336.06 A: um my mother 

336.28 343.00 A: is seriously having memory problems uh and jokes about alzheimer's aren't funny anymore 

342.72 348.10 B: no no uh absolutely not i i can see your point completely 

346.88 348.28 A: mhm 

348.13 354.59 B: uh it it it can be funny but it's exactly like i'm saying when it hit home it's not so funny 

353.99 355.40 A: right right 

354.75 366.08 B: it's it's it's really not and uh i've i'm i'm in my mid forties and i've even noticed with my mother and she has respiratory uh problems and i've noticed that lack of oxygen 

366.00 370.66 B: has affected her uh memory in the sense that we'll have a conversation 

370.56 385.24 B: and in the the next day or so we'll again have exactly that same conversation as if it's the first time i ever heard it or it'll be about me and i was there and she's telling me a- about it as if i weren't even there 

374.96 375.98 A: mhm 

378.24 379.19 A: right 

384.44 385.67 A: mhm 

385.02 386.47 B: you know so 

385.77 397.94 A: and one time that might be funny but if it goes on then you start really worrying about that person and what it means about your future with that person and everything you know all kinds of things and and jokes about 

394.83 396.49 B: really yeah 

397.92 401.69 A: about it just you you just can't laugh at 'em anymore 

402.17 403.03 A: um 

402.52 413.33 B: it's it's true and the closer it is to home the less humored it actually is i mean comedy i think has to be something uh that that can be held in general 

406.90 408.00 A: yeah 

412.92 414.00 A: mhm 

413.38 416.00 B: okay it has to be held in general 

416.09 423.54 B: uh and then there are you know some some margin and and there are some lines and you always have to leave a margin 

421.07 421.98 A: mhm 

423.02 424.28 A: right 

423.62 431.94 B: you always have to leave that margin i mean do i mean people really do tend to cross the lines and and like i say you can leave that margin 

431.80 441.71 B: and and that way it doesn't have to be you know taken so personally you know and all like that but uh people really do uh 

436.59 437.74 A: mhm 

438.55 439.48 A: mhm 

441.58 447.63 B: uh they they quite often expose ignorance uh instead of intellect when it comes to humor 

447.28 448.31 A: right 

448.33 462.86 A: sometimes though the some of the funniest things are things that are shared between people because they are so you know they do touch home you know but it's it's with people that you have an established understanding of and you know 

462.86 465.70 A: kind of where their funny bone is and where 

465.01 472.57 B: yeah myself life is can be so cruel or it it can be uh so terrible at times 

472.38 482.43 B: that really and truly if you don't keep your sense of humor and really learn to laugh at things and you take e- everything so literally and so seriously it'll drive you nuts 

481.83 482.94 A: yeah 

482.34 490.73 B: you really do um i mean because i've i've accused of my wife uh i've always you know being told that one of my better traits was my sense of humor 

490.12 491.04 A: mhm 

490.89 492.08 B: and uh 

492.10 499.44 B: but yeah you can't you can't get too personal you know with people you have to keep things in general 

498.78 500.18 A: mhm 

499.67 501.78 B: to a to a certain degree 

501.10 502.45 A: mhm 

501.83 508.98 B: because i mean you can really uh uh you know hurt people's feelings and and not even realize it until you've already done it 

508.44 509.47 A: right 

508.86 517.13 B: and then if you're not man enough or woman enough or big enough to go back and say listen i'm sorry i mean i didn't know that this applied to you 

516.72 517.83 A: mhm 

517.20 528.61 B: you know so personally i mean i i remember when i was in high school the joke was going around about uh uh about hey you know did you hear the bit about 

518.88 519.77 A: right 

528.71 535.06 B: such and such uh going swimming and they'd come back and go hey you know that was my sister she died she drowned 

533.17 534.12 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

535.19 540.33 B: so and and just to watch the look on their face i mean i had that pulled on me so many times 

539.73 541.17 A: mhm 

540.59 552.34 B: you know so that's just kind of an example right there that end end up uh at large it was a joke but gosh just think if that was really true i mean just how terrible you would have felt 

547.06 548.10 A: mhm 

549.74 550.76 A: (( right it )) 

551.11 552.82 A: wouldn't be funny at all 

552.40 554.98 B: right [laughter] 

553.06 553.78 A: right 

554.29 558.88 A: it's it's it's hard to know what what makes comedy you know um 

560.13 571.23 A: sometimes my daughter i have a twelve year old daughter and she thinks i have no sense of humor at all but her sense her idea of what's funny and my idea are quite different things 

570.64 572.47 B: [laughter] 

571.85 574.13 A: [laughter] yeah 

573.84 579.81 B: yeah i can i can understand that but then again too there is a a generation gap 

579.24 580.51 A: mhm 

579.90 588.48 B: and you know people closer to our age have just been through life and we've seen the ins and outs and and how cruel uh life can be 

586.76 587.67 A: mhm 

587.93 588.87 A: right 

588.59 599.89 B: and then and then you have the ignorance and which ignorance is not an insulting word it's a factual word because the the youthful are are ignorant to certain facts 

595.35 596.34 A: right
