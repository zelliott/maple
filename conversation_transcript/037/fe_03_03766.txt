0.67 2.81 A: hi my name is michelle 

0.78 2.98 B: hi i'm carol 

2.97 4.15 A: hi 

4.45 5.74 B: what's your name 

5.48 7.69 A: my name is michelle st john 

7.49 14.91 B: hi michelle so uh today it's humor what was it it's like where do you draw the line between what's acceptable and what's not acceptable 

8.63 9.60 A: hi 

14.91 20.49 A: um i don't know if it was where do you draw the line so much like how how do you you know how do you handle it when 

20.89 25.29 A: you know when somebody does draw the line isn't that what they said [mn] i don't know i can't remember 

25.27 26.08 B: (( we- )) 

26.20 27.66 B: (( well )) 

26.84 30.14 A: but like like how do you handle somebody that's you know 

30.51 36.24 A: that that's you know that might have overstep the boundaries of of being funny you know to everybody else 

35.87 40.84 B: i see um okay we'll go with that what do you thi- what do you say 

41.22 47.48 A: well um it's difficult because everybody has their you know their own sense of humor 

47.50 50.40 A: so at the same time you know you 

50.48 53.36 A: you might be put off or um 

53.79 61.05 A: insulted by somebody's you know by by a joke that somebody told and somebody else might find it really funny so 

61.52 72.83 A: i don't know if there's really a way that you can act to discourage the behavior other than to just you know just kind of ignore it or gloss over it or don't don't really pay it much heed i guess 

73.28 81.31 B: [noise] well uh actually if somebody i knew said something that i didn't think was funny i would just tell them i don't think that's very funny 

74.25 75.07 A: (( well how )) 

77.98 78.84 A: uh-huh 

81.10 81.96 A: uh-huh 

81.45 85.77 B: and i i'd probably make some comment to them to the effect that 

85.82 88.35 B: why did you have to why'd you tell me that 

88.09 89.48 A: right right 

88.84 99.13 B: um i was thinking that what they were thinking was um what do you think is funny or what do you not think is funny um 

98.42 99.21 A: okay 

99.22 113.85 B: i don't think it's funny when um like for example somebody has a laugh at someone else's expense when the expense is something that hurts their feelings 

108.29 109.41 A: right 

113.87 118.73 B: or damages their self esteem in some way i guess is the same thing 

118.66 120.82 A: (( yeah i totally agree with you [laughter] )) 

118.81 119.74 B: um 

120.55 124.08 B: but you know what's what's what it's so funny 

123.99 132.68 B: it's so funny but i think what we find funny most of the time is like stupidity like [laughter] when i'm in a hurry 

127.51 128.42 A: (( mhm )) 

129.95 130.98 A: right 

132.51 142.55 B: i bang my head on the on the cabinet or i'll hit my elbow on the door and you know it's like i i get so aggravated i have to laugh at myself 

141.93 142.84 A: right 

142.40 150.15 B: and it's like when you see something on t._v. and like that dick van dyke thing where he would trip over the ottoman everybody always thought that was funny 

148.96 149.84 A: (( yeah )) 

149.94 150.88 A: uh-huh 

150.99 160.62 A: yeah yeah it see- but it does seem like that too even with little kids sometimes when you know a a small child will fall fall off a bike or whatever the other children will laugh and 

160.67 169.12 A: you know that sometimes it it's difficult 'cause you know like your first reaction would be to laugh but then sometimes you know somebody gets hurt it's all fun and games until somebody gets hurt 

169.01 178.51 B: this is true it's isn't that the way it is your first reaction is like to laugh i have a fourteen year old son and we were wrestling one day and he 

169.39 170.31 A: (( mm )) 

171.87 172.89 A: uh-huh 

173.74 175.09 A: mhm 

179.17 189.33 B: [mn] something happened and i hit my head and the first thing he did was start laughing and i was almost crying and then he's like oh no are you okay 

183.71 185.24 A: right right 

185.64 187.00 A: (( right [noise] )) 

188.03 189.09 A: right 

189.36 192.33 A: yeah yeah that is strange you know 

191.93 196.86 B: it's twisted that we think that where people get hurt this is a funny thing 

195.93 205.03 A: right well i don't know if that's why people necessarily laugh i think it's you know kind of you know stupidity like you say you know like when you trip over your own feet kind of thing it's 

204.96 214.54 A: you know it's like it's it's like a blunder i guess somebody you know makes a blunder and it's kind of funny and then and then until you real- you know until you realize that they might be hurt and 

214.67 223.30 A: and then go and check i also think that um what what you said as far as like when people aren't funny i don't i don't agree with 

223.36 236.25 A: dirty you know like really dirty jokes [laughter] i'm just not one of those people that laugh at those types of jokes or or or jokes that are like you said you know hurtful if if they demeaning towards women or what have you 

228.54 229.70 B: yeah 

235.97 237.10 B: right 

237.21 242.39 B: well right and there's a whole lot of those going around but um 

240.96 242.33 A: (( so mhm )) 

242.70 246.27 B: [lipsmack] you know i guess i kind of 

246.64 247.74 B: um 

247.96 250.66 B: have a uh uh um 

250.85 257.99 B: a laid back attitude about things like that if somebody tells me a joke that i consider off color i'll make a face at them once again and say 

256.15 256.76 A: (( mm )) 

258.17 261.12 B: that's not appropriate 

260.35 261.99 A: right right 

261.32 267.75 B: and then you know maybe deprive them of my company [laughter] like walk away 

265.15 267.29 A: exactly exactly 

267.77 281.59 B: so that they don't cross that line again but see i think some jokes are funny like dirty jokes are funny but o- only in a light attitude um you know not not really raunchy ones um 

267.85 268.81 A: yeah 

280.07 282.81 A: yeah yeah i'm into raunchy ones [laughter] 

282.14 286.52 B: yeah but um i can find humor in um 

286.91 294.62 B: you know a lot of things but you know with kids these days i like i said i had a fourt- i have a fourteen year old son 

294.50 295.52 A: uh-huh 

295.19 306.47 B: they are so cruel to each other in determining what's funny and you know i always heard that girls were so cruel you know in like but oh these kids 

297.54 298.99 A: i know 

303.30 304.21 A: right 

306.27 316.69 B: they they knock around on each other they beat up on each other they shoot these little paper wads and they think that's funny they they think it's hilarious and 

314.10 315.00 A: right 

315.79 326.71 A: yeah i have two kids too my my kids haven't reached the teenage years yet so [laughter] i'm looking forward to that i have a two and a six year old so they're more easily entertained but you know 

326.63 339.16 A: still you know my sometimes my daughter she's six my dau- my son is two and she'll pick on him and she'll you know she thinks it's funny [laughter] you know yeah you know and he puts up with it 

335.23 340.58 B: yeah she'll think it's funny right and like if he falls down or something does she laugh 

339.53 342.42 A: right yeah she does mhm 

341.50 351.87 B: you know i can remember when my son was just almost two maybe he was two or almost two he was he's always been kinda like an entertainer and he would 

351.92 354.37 B: slap himself in the chest and go 

354.47 366.04 B: [mn] and fall down on his rear end and go uh-oh fall down and then we were all supposed to laugh and then would get up and he would do it again and he would do it three or four times 

356.41 357.14 A: uh-huh 

359.08 361.06 A: right right [laughter] right right 

361.73 362.75 A: yeah 

364.31 370.31 A: yeah my son does yeah my son does that two actually that's what that's his age right now like two and half and that's what he does now 

369.69 383.36 B: well see isn't that funny because they think that's funny but you know i guess it's because like when they were learning to walk and they would fall down you'd go uh-oh fall down and you would make ni- happy faces so that they wouldn't cry 

377.02 378.37 A: right 

378.60 380.75 A: uh-huh right right 

383.11 384.48 A: exactly 

383.68 384.89 B: you think 

384.58 394.67 A: yeah i think that could be it but you know even even at a young age well you know my son he'll laugh at me too if if if uh i hurt myself on accident you know and 

393.16 396.80 B: or if you dropped your purse or something yeah 

394.88 407.23 A: r- right right but if he sees that i'm hurt you know he his his expression does change you know so i i i don't think that pe- they really laugh because they think oh ha ha she just hurt herself 

400.23 402.12 B: changes yeah 

406.80 407.88 B: right 

407.30 410.84 A: you know it's more like oh gosh that looked goofy you know 

410.22 417.71 B: right and even like wh- when they get older then they see that you know you've hurt yourself and that's not a funny thing 

415.42 417.13 A: mhm mhm 

417.78 428.41 B: but you know what they people think is funny on t._v. is beyond me i mean i don't watch a lot of t._v. e- but um 

417.85 418.70 A: right 

423.98 425.02 A: yeah 

428.36 435.81 B: i know my son does and i feel like a lot of the things that he sees on t._v. are somewhat inappropriate and what they think are funny 

432.97 435.82 A: yeah that worries me 

435.70 448.87 B: you know it it is something to worry about because they get to an age where you just can- you think you know what they're doing and he'll and my son'll say oh i he was like eleven and he would say oh i saw that movie and i'd say oh 

442.53 443.54 A: right 

448.72 452.03 A: where where was i [laughter] right 

448.97 459.56 B: where did you see that movie and he'd say oh i was over at so and so's house um and you know other parents don't necessarily monitor the kids the way you would like to 

453.86 454.91 A: uh-huh 

459.33 474.01 B: and you know the simple fact of the matter is if they want to expose themselves to something there's really not a lot that you can do about it um because they'll always find that opportunity if they really are interested in it so 

459.43 460.52 A: mhm 

467.31 468.53 A: (( that's true )) 

473.03 476.34 A: it's just uh kinda unbelievable to me how far though 

476.62 490.56 A: it it's gotten on a on t._v. i mean it just seems like it seems like ten years ago they weren't allowed to show a bra you know and it's just you know that really worries me i mean that kind of regulatory thing i know totally like 

478.99 481.33 B: on t._v. yeah 

483.65 484.83 B: right 

486.85 488.59 B: now there's nudity 

489.87 497.27 B: and you know this is we're talking prime time t._v. which i i i don't know by the time your kids are my son's age 

492.85 494.07 A: mhm 

494.11 494.95 A: (( mhm )) 

497.09 508.27 B: who knows what it's gonna be like unless somebody wakes up and realizes hey these are very tender minds that and we have to protect them and um 

498.52 500.09 A: i know 

501.50 502.52 A: yeah 

508.20 514.47 B: you know if the parents don't do it then the um 

514.52 516.79 B: the the sponsors won't 

515.59 520.86 A: but but like you said it's hard for the parents because you can't be there all 

518.35 520.10 B: well you know what we have to 

520.97 527.11 A: all the time you know you have to kind of put some of the responsibility upon our 

527.31 531.41 A: (( [mn] our you know the media and totally )) 

528.86 530.54 B: the system right 

530.65 545.42 B: well but the thing is the only way that a parent can control that kind of thing is by writing or voicing their concerns to the sponsors and then the sponsors will in turn boycott the um 

540.58 541.68 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

545.28 549.92 B: you know the shows that um that that [mn] 

550.23 560.55 B: demonstrate that in- inappropriate humor at inappropriate times and that's really the only way to get something like that changed because don't even think that those 

560.38 573.28 B: t._v. people would ever get a a bone of responsibility i mean that's not gonna happen so the only way for you to do thing is things in this world is really go for the money and [noise] that's going to the sponsors 

564.06 565.92 A: right right 

571.12 572.13 A: mhm 

573.14 574.25 A: mhm 

573.62 575.21 B: so um 

575.84 577.91 B: [lipsmack] you know but then 

577.20 583.01 A: ev- but even some of the cartoons i think have a have you know some adult hu- humor in there 

582.63 583.67 B: really 

583.05 587.39 A: yeah sometimes it kinda goes unnoticed because you know they're not really at an age to even 

588.00 594.88 A: c- catch it you know because they're not uh i mean they're not experienced enough to know any better 

590.13 591.10 B: right 

593.11 598.31 B: like rugrats why does the doctor's name have to be dr lipshits 

595.07 595.77 A: (( right )) 

598.17 599.76 A: [laughter] 

598.36 599.89 B: (( [laughter] why ))
