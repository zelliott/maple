4.52 5.93 B: okay how are you 

5.63 10.06 A: good first time i've done this are you familiar with the process 

9.59 12.37 B: [noise] [cough] i did it one time the other day 

11.78 12.94 A: okay 

12.47 15.83 B: we're supposed to talk about the minimum wage and um 

16.67 17.69 B: (( i um )) 

17.84 20.37 B: i don't really know what to say about it [sigh] 

19.83 27.84 A: okay um i don't think it's high enough i think they you know i don't see how anybody could exist on five dollars and fifteen cents an hour 

27.70 30.17 B: [noise] yeah i agree 

29.27 37.83 A: um it might work for you know high school kids or you know somebody like that but you know you've got a lotta people out there [laughter] trying to make a a life 

37.54 50.28 B: [noise] yeah you know i saw on a on [noise] um [lipsmack] i was watching one of those court t. t._v. shows today and they were talking about this lady that has to rent a house [noise] and she pays nine hundred dollars a month for rent 

50.31 53.76 B: and i know apartments go for like that much too 

52.51 53.59 A: mhm 

53.77 61.13 B: [lipsmack] [noise] and yeah i have a twenty year old son that you know he makes more than minimum wage but he couldn't [noise] 

61.14 63.55 B: he can't even afford to buy his own gas 

63.31 64.32 A: right 

65.09 73.89 A: well i know that if they raise the minimum wage then you know people have to start charging more for their services or more for their products but um 

73.55 74.35 B: (( [sigh] )) 

74.20 81.29 A: you know that affects inflation and everything but i still don't think you know i think at least it should be at least six dollars an hour 

77.18 78.23 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

80.99 84.97 B: [noise] yeah that sounds [noise] a a lot better 

84.27 85.76 A: yeah 

85.55 94.31 B: uh um sometimes i consider going to work and i haven't worked since you know in since before i had kids and 

93.37 94.44 A: mhm 

94.48 100.25 B: i can't you know minimum wage isn't enough to entice me back into the job market 

99.92 101.66 A: it wouldn't pay for your daycare 

101.51 109.48 B: [noise] well my son's twenty so [mn] yeah but i- if i had to pay daycare oh gosh that's you know 

103.35 104.54 A: (( oh okay )) 

109.87 111.63 B: there's no way i could do that 

111.27 112.21 A: right 

112.76 118.34 A: well the other thing is i think it's abominable that we pay our military so very little 

118.31 119.42 A: um 

119.40 130.51 A: you know you've got people who are outta high school and go right into the military and they go right onto welfare almost or at least food stamps because if they're married and especially if they have a child 

130.27 131.18 B: uh-huh 

130.36 136.02 A: they can't afford to you know to live and then we ask 'em to go off and defend our country 

136.60 141.21 A: so i think you know if they oh and they have to pay income tax on top of that 

140.62 142.15 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

142.10 144.56 A: so [mn] you know i think we ought to 

143.26 144.14 B: (( [noise] )) 

144.44 151.94 A: and it's a little bit off the subject but i think we ought to waive income tax for military people at least up until a certain level i mean 

151.74 161.98 A: obviously a general should be able to pay you know income tax but not privates and you know i don't know all the military ranks starting from the bottom but at least several levels 

161.65 170.27 B: [cough] yeah [noise] i i know a girl that um [lipsmack] well i i know her on the internet i've never met her but her husband's in um 

170.78 172.28 B: [noise] over in the middle east 

172.00 173.80 A: mhm 

172.49 173.96 B: and she's just [noise] 

174.09 178.57 B: uh you know she's says that they're barely barely getting by 

178.60 180.93 B: [noise] so i know he doesn't 

181.40 184.11 B: [cough] make enough i guess to 

185.32 189.68 B: keep his family comfortable or maybe she's just freaked out because he's gone 

189.78 191.08 B: but um 

191.24 196.47 B: yeah it seems like we should take better care of our military and their families 

195.92 208.15 A: well i think the same applies to police officers and to firemen and to some extent teachers uh i think you know the fireman and the police officer put their lives on the line so i think they shouldn't have to pay income tax and then i think teachers 

207.94 211.23 A: shouldn't have to pay income tax up until they hit a certain level 

211.20 223.72 B: well it's pretty ridiculous they place um pay the sports players millions of dollars a year and then [mn] the people who who work jobs that are responsible for our children don't make anything [cough] 

223.41 225.39 A: that's right 

225.41 226.51 A: um 

227.87 235.43 B: i mean we could live without a football hero but we can't live without politicians and policemen and doctors and teachers 

227.99 228.79 A: (( [mn] )) 

235.47 238.06 A: now i would think politicians oughta work for free 

238.47 239.99 B: yeah 

239.08 247.84 A: you know i know they don't get and i mean the president doesn't get paid that much and i think a lot lotta politicians and stuff you know uh end up with you know a much higher salary than i think 

247.83 254.27 A: is reasonable i mean if you want to be a politician and you're doing it for the good of the community it's like when you do volunteer work 

253.84 255.91 B: yeah yeah 

254.28 261.65 A: you know you're not in it for the money you should be in it to to benefit the community the you know the country or whatever it is you're you know trying to be 

261.37 264.33 B: yeah 

261.87 263.41 A: involved in but 

264.00 265.03 A: um 

265.23 268.18 A: i guess we've digressed a little bit but still you know it's 

268.19 272.75 A: we're talking [laughter] minimum wage here i don't know how much else we can say about it 

270.31 272.59 B: (( yeah )) 

273.57 274.62 B: (( [noise] i know )) 

275.47 277.92 B: [noise] you know it's kind of a hard topic 

277.46 279.69 A: yeah um 

280.70 284.89 A: gosh i can't even remember what minimum wage was when i was a kid uh 

285.09 288.47 A: and i could barely get by 

288.17 289.50 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [lipsmack] yeah )) 

288.57 293.86 A: and and i'm i'm pretty smart with my money you know at least i was as a kid [laughter] and 

292.41 294.29 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

294.32 296.84 A: (( [laughter] oh but um )) 

297.23 300.92 A: i don't know i i i don't think five fifteen an hour is high enough 

301.76 302.69 B: no 

304.52 311.64 B: [noise] no i don't either not when i even with gas and everything is so expensive like you know [mn] [noise] 

314.53 328.31 A: well if they're gonna set minimum wage low then i think they ought to freeze prices on certain commodities like bread milk you know that sort of thing i mean if you're not gonna let somebody make a decent living at least don't charge 'em so much for what they have to have to live on 

314.54 315.92 B: and you wor- [noise] 

328.62 330.62 B: (( yeah [noise] [cough] [noise] )) 

330.21 333.08 A: but i don't think we'll get that there's too many other 

333.79 340.90 A: um criteria involved in trying to get that done and then of course you you know you got government messing around too much in your business so 

340.96 349.64 B: [noise] yeah and uh and they hold so much in taxes out and [noise] it's it's like 

342.04 342.60 A: (( [sigh] )) 

342.80 343.76 A: (( i don't i don't )) 

351.34 354.20 B: [noise] they just tax you death and 

353.14 354.76 A: yep 

354.82 369.28 A: well i think they oughta raise the sales tax on certain things obviously not on food and stuff that where they can make up their tax and doing our streets and paying our military and police and stuff and schools and everything else that we need but um 

368.50 369.16 B: (( [lipsmack] [noise] )) 

370.83 376.20 B: [noise] like luxury taxes because the people that can afford to buy 

372.67 375.28 A: yeah yeah 

376.82 379.16 B: [noise] the yachts and the um 

378.99 380.48 A: right 

379.52 383.57 B: [lipsmack] huge cars and that they can afford to pay 'em off [noise] 

380.97 382.68 A: right 

383.31 395.57 A: yeah and i think that we oughta have a flat tax on the income tax because then those people who are only making minimum wage aren't paying proportionally more than somebody who is making hundreds of thousands or or millions a year 

395.22 396.64 B: yeah 

396.36 402.26 A: you know they the the lower paid people don't have the tax uh loopholes or um 

402.30 408.82 A: [lipsmack] deductions that someone else can come up with when they've you know got a lot of money you know that's discretionary 

407.93 413.15 B: [noise] [sigh] yeah like investment property and all that stuff 

409.22 410.35 A: but uh 

412.28 413.44 A: mhm 

413.62 424.52 A: and you know they can pay c._p._a.s and attorneys to figure all this stuff out for 'em and everything but somebody making minimum wage they can't afford to you know even pay h&r block probably to do their taxes 

413.68 414.24 B: (( [cough] )) 

414.59 415.20 B: (( [cough] )) 

424.05 425.57 B: yeah 

424.96 425.77 A: so 

427.32 428.53 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

428.72 429.88 A: don't know 

430.30 433.12 A: what else and h- we're supposed to talk for eight minutes 

432.95 434.87 B: [noise] [noise] y- ten minutes 

434.20 436.75 A: [noise] i'm on the phone um 

437.07 440.18 A: i didn't even start noticing what time it was when we started 

440.81 445.32 B: [noise] oh we've been on about five or six minutes i think 

443.81 444.70 A: okay 

445.98 448.18 B: so do you do you work 

447.73 451.01 A: yes full time and then have part time jobs 

450.76 454.62 B: yeah i i couldn't imagine um 

454.81 456.20 B: (( [noise] i know [mn] )) 

456.52 468.87 B: you know if i was like twenty years old and just starting out you know how they're supposed to come up with the kinda money it takes to live on your own my son still lives at home 

468.47 470.10 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

469.28 483.07 B: and he he works full time and he's got a new car so he m- he has his car payments and his insurance payments and you know he he pays rent on a studio at work 'cause he's a musician 

482.90 483.85 A: mhm 

483.18 487.34 B: and that that just about eats up his his money 

487.69 489.68 B: and uh [cough] 

490.11 496.78 B: feeding himself and he makes more [noise] he he makes like eight or eight fifty an hour 

496.25 497.51 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

497.14 498.46 B: and um 

498.52 500.75 B: he can't afford to move out 

501.22 502.21 B: you know 

501.28 507.23 A: well like when when insurance is mandatory and then you know you've gotta have health insurance and you know 

506.90 508.26 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

507.16 516.71 A: i said you gotta have housing you got to have you know at least a reliable vehicle not necessarily a brand new one but i don't think five fifteen an hour would you know give anybody that option 

516.56 518.61 B: (( no not at all [noise] )) 

519.37 529.43 B: and um he's got friends h- that you know aren't married didn't have children and i they rely on their parents to help 'em out they can't you know 

530.17 533.94 B: [noise] i i just don't see how how they even make it 

534.60 544.14 B: you know o- one of his friends doesn't have a car they have their own place to live but they still rely on their parents to to help support them and make their 

544.62 551.06 B: their um power bills and stuff and [lipsmack] you know uh even with with 

551.11 554.14 B: the husband working full time they're still on 

554.17 555.15 B: um 

555.50 559.83 B: uh food stamps and government healthcare 

556.73 557.78 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

560.48 567.46 A: yeah and once anybody making minimum wage has no hope of being able to afford to go to college or to take classes to 

567.45 581.10 A: you know benefit themselves and get them educated where they could possibly make more there's no way that they can even afford to send their kids to college so that at least the next generation has a chance to to uh you know make themselves better so [noise] 

572.58 573.16 B: (( [noise] )) 

580.21 582.16 B: yeah 

582.40 586.10 B: no they need to do something ra- raise it 

586.34 587.33 B: more 

588.14 591.94 B: give everybody t- something to hope for something to dream 

591.78 592.62 A: (( yeah )) 

594.17 599.89 A: but then do you know too um you know one of the drawbacks to raising it is that whenever you raise the 

595.34 596.17 B: (( [cough] ))
