19.59 20.46 A: uh-huh 

20.46 21.67 B: and 

21.91 29.74 B: i guess the topic of the day is the minimum wage and up here i believe it's a little higher than five dollars and fifteen cents but 

28.97 31.03 A: really yes 

30.43 41.10 B: i'm i'm not exactly sure about that um i know there's the federal minimum wage and i'm wondering if we don't have a higher one for the state 

36.48 37.47 A: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

40.59 44.14 A: well you know i would think california would have a higher minimum wage as well 

44.25 45.41 B: (( i would )) 

45.43 53.18 B: but you know i know that um there's a lot of migrant farm workers as well just like there is in washington state 

52.50 53.43 A: right 

53.22 55.04 B: so maybe that 

55.30 59.07 B: i i don't know if that applies to them although i would think that it would [noise] 

58.73 61.54 A: oh i i think it should if it doesn't [laughter] 

62.46 63.64 A: i don't i 

62.47 64.61 B: you you are sure it doesn't 

64.52 67.57 A: oh no i i think that it should if it doesn't 

67.00 68.55 B: oh i agree 

67.81 73.65 A: [laughter] i think the minimum wage has to be a lot higher for today's economy 

73.95 76.81 B: [noise] well and especially for um [noise] [sigh] [lipsmack] 

77.92 87.48 B: the people who are uh single heads of households [noise] that have families and they they don't have two incomes and they're really struggling 

81.49 83.02 A: oh right or or fe- 

83.04 84.01 A: right 

87.59 92.01 B: to make ends meet how can you even with the housing 

92.03 97.04 B: like it is in um our states make it i don't see how they can [noise] 

97.36 98.47 A: well you know 

98.70 102.13 A: with the unemployment rate the rate that it is 

102.19 111.93 A: and so many people out of work i know a lot of people it's been on the news about how people are not able to find work because the wages that they're offering are so low 

112.23 126.69 A: you know they're not eligible for unemployment benefits anymore yet the jobs that they can get are you know five seventy five or or even less you know in some places like a commission you know it evens out to be even less than that 

121.50 122.39 B: yes 

126.98 130.34 B: i don't see how people make it on that no i 

128.77 130.80 A: no uh there's no way you can [noise] 

130.72 136.84 B: i i sometimes think that there should be two tiers of um 

137.97 139.71 B: you know minimum wage 

139.41 140.49 A: oh yeah 

139.85 148.68 B: because i can say only paying a teenager who just has totally discretionary income by their wages 

144.87 145.54 A: i 

148.26 149.18 A: right 

149.71 153.69 B: five dollars an hour but i can't see doing that for 

153.87 159.80 B: uh but i know it it's according to the work done but it's i i don't know i don't know about the 

159.33 167.32 A: well see i don't even think it's according to the work done because a lot of places are i mean minimum wages that's that's the minimum for everybody every company 

167.16 174.61 A: you know that's the minimum that they can hire out at it doesn't matter if you're delivering pizzas or if you're working in a store or working in a office somewhere 

174.56 175.45 B: right 

174.73 182.42 A: you know that's the amount i think it should have different minimum wage amounts for every type of job 

182.72 188.33 A: you know like delivering pizzas you know of course five seventy five is good if you get a commission or tips or whatever 

188.71 191.44 B: right but i i also think that 

189.33 190.23 A: (( you know )) 

191.66 204.89 B: the market [cough] excuse me sometimes drives wages i know in here in in the seattle area where housing is so high that actually the pizza delivery people make pretty good money 

200.97 201.83 A: right 

204.50 209.70 A: [noise] yeah you know that's my area also i'm in the san francisco bay area so 

208.54 218.58 B: so you know i i think the market in some sectors and for some people has worked because obviously people aren't gonna 

219.03 223.33 B: be able to live and work in that area so it does drive it up [noise] but then 

220.34 221.21 A: right 

223.65 234.62 B: what about those people in rural areas the housing is lower but you know the cost of living with the the cost of goods and the cost of groceries 

225.85 227.47 A: exactly and you know what 

233.94 234.94 A: right 

235.36 237.89 A: i mean it's like the price of gas alone 

237.96 241.23 B: oh up here it's outrageous 

238.33 245.32 A: you've gotta work an hour to get two and half tanks [laughter] huh i mean it's two dollars and two dollars a gallon out here [noise] 

241.94 242.98 B: [laughter] [laughter] it's 

244.82 252.37 B: well and i have a friend since i have a friend who lives an hour away from a walmart and that's the closest major shopping for her 

252.33 260.41 B: so can you imagine the gas alone during a week trying to do your grocery shopping and just incidentals 

253.76 254.55 A: oh 

255.21 256.36 A: oh yeah 

260.52 269.25 A: oh yeah well with the minimum wage being at five seventy five i know that there are there is talks about increasing it which i wholeheartedly agree with and i 

268.32 269.68 B: [noise] i do too 

269.19 278.49 A: i mean it's it's just for nowadays it needs to be i mean enough for ten years ago huh honestly five seventy would have been sufficient ten years ago 

275.94 276.76 B: well 

278.42 284.47 B: right well i think i think the other thing that has to be addressed and i and i know that is 

284.81 285.86 B: um 

286.10 296.81 B: really difficult and people have on different sides of the political divide have different ideas but you know if people just had uh basic health interest 

291.88 292.69 A: right 

295.60 299.30 A: oh i a great idea a great idea [noise] 

297.65 302.38 B: that's three or four hundred dollars out of pocket i have a friend she does um 

302.96 308.46 B: [lipsmack] uh respite care for developmentally disabled children and she's a single gal 

304.57 305.63 A: (( oh okay )) 

306.64 307.53 A: right 

308.55 310.15 B: and um 

310.45 313.11 B: [lipsmack] i think she makes like seven dollars an hour 

313.28 314.65 B: and 

314.84 322.34 B: she was just sharing with me that they have unionized and they are hoping to get basic healthcare 'cause she works full time 

321.85 323.17 A: that would be great 

322.24 333.04 B: and doesn't get it and she said she pays out of pocket three to four hundred dollars for basic health so that would be a major boost in her income without even her wages being changed 

323.50 324.54 A: oh 

332.42 339.69 A: exactly and you know a lotta companies nowadays in this area are hiring part time people two part time people for one full time position 

339.27 341.01 B: so they don't have to pay those 

340.01 347.52 A: exactly and they have to they're responsible for their own healthcare that way they're making the minimum wage and they still have to pay out of pocket 

343.15 343.98 B: yes 

347.63 350.02 A: you know a- and a lotta people nowadays 

347.84 351.44 B: uh i i think that's been doing a lot here too [sigh] 

351.21 358.58 A: well a lotta people nowadays can't even you know the younger people can't even afford to go to college because they're working going to school they're yeah they can't save up that money 

351.45 352.01 B: (( [noise] )) 

358.70 363.04 A: because they're making minimum wage in a restaurant or you know doing whatever they're doing 

363.04 364.41 B: (( right [noise] )) 

363.93 375.30 A: um it's hard for a lotta people and our ch- they're not even making that choice whether or not they can h- you know to college unless they can get a scholarship because they're not making enough money 

375.46 380.91 A: which they shouldn't have to work at a five seventy five an hour job 

381.47 385.88 A: you know full time or even you know part time really if you're gonna go to school full time 

385.79 386.67 B: right 

386.24 389.37 A: it's too hard to do that with that little mo- bit of money 

389.52 395.61 B: oh i i put myself through college and i worked almost full time to do it and 

395.89 398.33 B: i can't imagine trying to do it now

398.90 402.32 B: with the cost of of um 

399.91 400.86 A: oh

434.69 436.24 B: you're kidding me 

435.68 437.44 A: no [laughter]

485.84 499.02 A: [noise] [noise] exactly we know it they're trying to to give you know rent control and and all this subsidized stuff a chance but the real thing they need to do is increase the minimum wage and create more jobs

500.13 501.09 B: that 

501.53 507.04 B: well and you know what else i think that's [noise] so incredibly important is um a- 

508.49 517.34 B: and i'm not talking about throwing more money at the schools but we have to do something about education you know we live in a state we both live in states that are
