0.00 1.30 B: sonia 

1.10 2.45 A: lily 

3.90 4.48 B: (( [noise] )) 

4.66 5.61 B: hello 

5.19 6.16 A: (( hi )) 

6.13 7.52 B: (( hi lily )) 

6.96 7.88 A: (( hi )) 

7.97 10.15 B: oh well let's see um 

10.74 22.96 B: personally i think that a joke is a joke and um of course people are going to not find everything funny but me personally i don't take offence to anybody else's humor 

22.85 33.15 A: well i feel the same way i think i actually have a a maybe even an offensive sense of humor because like when things are really offensive they make me laugh 

32.13 33.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] me too )) 

33.36 37.03 A: maybe it's like a natural kind of reaction or something but 

35.60 37.59 B: yeah definitely 

37.42 38.45 A: um 

38.65 44.44 A: i don't i don't know i i find that like when when people react to 

44.55 46.24 A: comedy like that they're 

46.68 49.66 A: probably just looking for something to react to 

49.12 54.85 B: [noise] yeah definitely i i mean i laugh at everything from you know 

55.14 59.90 B: political jokes to sex jokes you know i don't have a problem with any type of humor 

59.40 60.48 A: yeah 

59.91 65.81 B: as long as it's meant in fun you know you can always tell if somebody means something in a malicious manner 

65.30 66.50 A: right 

65.87 74.73 B: you know and if it doen't seem that way to me then i never take offence to it you know and i think most of the things in this world 

70.57 71.57 A: right 

74.70 82.08 B: would not be considered offensive had not one person gotten offended by it in the first place 

81.50 82.55 A: right 

82.51 93.34 B: you know if everyone was just like yeah you know whatever it doesn't affect me then it wouldn't be it wouldn't have that offensive tendency to it 

92.89 93.98 A: right 

93.45 96.68 B: because you know if you're offending anybody it's not offensive 

96.20 98.83 A: right [laughter] yeah 

96.72 107.67 B: you know [laughter] so you know in personal exper- experience i'm spanish and you know people say spic and this and that and you know they say things like that thinking that you're gonna get upset 

107.22 108.27 A: right 

107.68 113.76 B: me personally i don't care you know because i know that if i don't care you're not gonna continue 

113.46 116.42 A: right and they they lose power also like 

115.62 116.62 B: they do 

116.48 120.65 A: that that 'cause that's what they if they want a reaction you know and you don't care 

120.19 121.42 B: mhm 

120.79 127.56 A: you know i mean like but i mean like race or or something like that like it's it's so easy to like 

127.80 131.65 A: you know try to provoke someone like that and you know 

130.25 131.42 B: mhm 

131.90 133.06 A: i mean even 

133.33 136.99 A: even when people when i was younger i used to get offended like 

137.01 146.22 A: when guys made jokes about women but now i don't care you know now that i'm older and stronger i'm just like whatever you know you can make all the jokes [laughter] you want 

139.22 140.03 B: mhm 

140.91 141.93 B: yeah 

142.59 143.64 B: mhm 

143.74 144.72 B: yeah 

146.00 147.55 B: [noise] exactly 

146.90 151.87 A: and even some i might find funny because i realize that stereotypes come from somewhere 

151.41 154.29 B: they do most stereotypes are true 

152.14 153.49 A: and you know like 

153.78 159.23 A: and stereotypes are funny and it's it's more about like knowing what people are like and kinda laughing about 

157.80 158.98 B: mhm 

159.29 163.13 A: people's idiosyncrasies or something along those lines 

160.75 162.01 B: yes 

162.64 169.31 B: yeah you know i mean we [noise] eat rice and beans almost every day and people make fun of that all the time [laughter] 

167.17 169.98 A: yeah [laughter] right 

169.35 175.69 B: but you know it's true we do why so why would i get upset at something that's true [noise] 

171.73 173.15 A: (( yeah )) 

174.85 183.64 A: right 'cause it's not even something you make fun of you know anyway you know like it's not offensive you know that you would eat rice and beans or anything like that you know 

179.70 180.90 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

182.63 183.74 B: mhm 

183.69 194.91 A: and it's like cultural and stuff and like that like i'm irish and i'm always like hey you know what everyone in my family's a big drinker [laughter] they're all like total alcoholics [laughter] but i 

187.28 188.24 B: yeah 

191.43 192.69 B: yeah [laughter] 

193.82 195.61 B: oh same here 

194.95 202.98 A: mean but i don't you know like when people are like yeah you're alcoholics i'm like yeah well we kinda are you know like it's true it's a stereotype that's true 

202.59 203.82 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

203.09 211.03 A: you know if it for whatever happened in history [noise] you know like and culturally like we certainly like alcohol you know and it's just 

206.15 207.64 B: yeah 

210.17 211.65 B: mhm 

211.22 213.76 A: i'm not gonna get mad you know like 

213.27 214.47 B: yeah 

213.85 222.24 A: it's it's it's well i mean it's different it's different than discrimination if someone were not to get a job for a reason like that i mean then you have to care but 

219.93 221.31 B: mhm 

221.70 222.90 B: yeah 

222.26 223.92 A: kidding around i mean 

223.93 237.32 B: yeah [noise] th- that's definitely the point if it's not [noise] meant to be you know malicious or if it's just mean to be funny then it's just funny you know and there's no reason to get upset or or to you know 

232.39 233.39 A: (( right )) 

237.43 243.06 B: take out your anger in in some violent manner or anything because 

241.49 242.27 A: right 

243.45 246.21 B: if you don't get mad then they're not gonna say it [laughter] 

245.63 246.83 A: right 

246.44 247.95 B: yeah 

247.99 255.79 A: like i was just sa- you know there's like a a website on the there's a site on the web that like makes fun of like fat people 

255.32 256.35 B: mhm 

256.08 257.21 A: and like 

257.74 260.35 A: people get so angry and like 

260.65 262.71 A: all i was thinking was you know like 

263.25 270.64 A: y- or like a lot of like fat people write in and like this is discrimination this isn't fair but i mean it's like 

267.94 269.21 B: mhm 

271.29 273.67 A: like caring about the website 

273.17 274.52 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

273.71 278.88 A: like they're making so much they're giving the person who runs the website so much more credit 

278.93 280.47 A: you know because they're 

280.75 281.85 A: they 

282.05 293.92 A: are making an uproar about it and then that's exactly what the person loves you know is having this huge reaction and then it just causes more fodder for them to make jokes and stuff 

283.87 285.08 B: mhm 

286.16 287.80 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

292.17 293.29 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

293.59 294.81 B: yeah 

294.37 298.68 A: than if they're just like oh well you know whatever you know stuff like 

297.39 304.20 B: definitely there's also a site online that makes fun of children's drawings 

303.22 305.39 A: (( that oh really )) 

304.47 311.89 B: and i think it is the funniest thing you know 'cause i have kids myself and half the time you can't tell what it is 

306.98 310.43 A: right [laughter] right 

311.30 312.91 A: yeah [laughter] 

311.96 317.66 B: you know and it's so funny because in in the beginning of the website it talks about how 

314.25 315.75 A: (( yeah )) 

318.01 330.46 B: kids are always giving their parents these crappy gifts they ask for bikes they ask for this and then they draw you this crappy picture that doesn't even look like the christmas tree and it is hysterical to see 

321.00 323.83 A: right right [laughter] 

325.98 328.69 A: [laughter] 

330.54 342.72 B: [laughter] and the fact that they insult it and the fact that they make fun of it i think is so hilarious but then there's other people who are like oh that's not funny or oh you know and come on isn't 

340.63 345.08 A: yeah that's really funny i mean i would totally find that [laughter] funny 

343.07 343.75 B: (( it )) 

345.14 352.32 A: because it's not like you're you're saying directly to the kid you know that's awful you shouldn't draw anymore you know it's like 

349.01 350.03 B: mhm 

350.80 353.62 B: yeah see that would be awful 

352.84 357.48 A: yeah like we can laugh about it i mean but kids are hilarious 

354.76 355.89 B: yeah 

357.27 358.26 B: mhm 

357.68 363.87 A: i mean that's like half the fun of having them [laughter] it's like laughing at how funny they are 

360.08 361.18 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

363.29 367.37 B: oh y- definitely i laugh at my kids all the time you know 

364.17 364.94 A: (( you know )) 

365.89 368.76 A: (( yeah )) 

367.43 372.44 B: and if you don't laugh at them you know and if you don't teach them to laugh at theirselves 

372.35 382.88 B: then they will take things offensively you know and they will be overly sensitive and they will be you know grow up to be one of those people who are just you know can't take a joke 

374.64 376.54 A: yeah 

382.34 383.85 A: yeah 

383.13 385.17 B: and you know you don't want that 

384.84 391.01 A: well my parents when they i was a sensitive kid and they used to tease me when i was little and i would be like 

389.67 390.63 B: mhm 

391.11 402.92 A: you don't you know i would feel so offended but it helped me when i got older because they would always say lighten up you know that was like they what they always said to me now like you've got to lighten up okay we're just teasing you you can't 

396.57 397.55 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

401.38 402.50 B: yeah 

402.83 410.77 A: you know get offended by every joke we make about you and it helped 'cause now i don't take when people tease me you know it's part of my sense of humor 

405.22 406.19 B: mhm 

410.20 411.49 B: mhm 

410.82 415.10 A: and it's really important i guess 'cause then you end up with kids that get offended at everything 

414.57 416.03 B: yes 

416.47 417.99 B: definitely 

417.55 421.52 A: (( yeah like what we were talk- how old are your kids [noise] )) 

419.78 422.77 B: oh uh seven and four 

422.71 423.41 A: oh 

423.33 435.23 B: yeah so you know my daughter is overly sensitive and you know people make fun of her and she gets all upset and uptight and i always try to tell her you know 

426.35 429.22 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

431.47 433.36 A: [noise] yeah [noise] 

435.33 438.84 B: if you cry they're gonna keep doing it 

438.26 439.07 A: (( [noise] )) 

438.90 444.16 B: but if you just ignore them they'll stop because it's not having any affect on you 

443.32 445.17 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

444.46 451.20 B: you know but she doesn't get that yet you know and i'm always trying to tell her that and then my son is like the complete opposite 

451.77 456.53 B: you know he doesn't care what anybody says about him he doesn't care that people laugh about him 

456.48 463.22 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] right )) 

456.55 462.50 B: you know but my daughter you know you laugh at a joke that you know or you don't laugh she gets all offended and 

462.46 470.20 B: she doesn't get sarcasm you know [laughter] and that's also funny but then if you laugh at her she feels bad [laughter] 

464.93 466.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

470.00 479.47 A: (( huh [noise] )) 

470.15 478.51 B: but you know it's so funny because once she um gave me a big flower and i said oh this smells so nice and she said 

478.56 487.24 B: mommy it's not real you know and they she took it so literal you know and it's so funny 

480.85 482.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] right right right right right [laughter] )) 

484.75 486.39 A: yeah [laughter] 

486.43 487.51 A: [laughter] 

487.92 492.35 B: you know you just have to teach them to let things you know roll off your backs 

488.04 488.84 A: (( [noise] )) 

490.87 493.53 A: yeah [laughter] definitely 

492.93 498.08 B: [laughter] the world would be a better place if we all just understood that a joke was a joke 

497.46 499.05 A: yeah definitely 

499.12 500.15 B: yeah 

499.86 506.31 A: well i guess girls [noise] i mean girls at least young girls can 

506.04 508.71 B: yeah of c- i think that they 

508.50 509.21 A: (( be )) 

509.13 510.23 A: (( pretty )) 

509.64 514.83 B: yes i think young girls um fight more than young boys 

510.00 533.62 A: mean [laughter] exclusionary you know yeah [noise] [noise] yeah right it's probably just it's something built into our culture that we don't even know 

514.88 525.19 B: but i think it all has to do with when little girls fight you know it it's like oh i'm gonna tell on you and boys have a little tiff it's like you know they handle it amongst themselves 

525.41 527.80 B: so you don't hear about it as much 

533.25 534.29 B: yeah 

533.67 536.14 A: where it comes from you know like girls feel 

536.29 540.67 A: because i felt like i felt very defenseless against the hum- you know like 

536.32 537.33 B: mhm 

540.85 549.76 A: sarcasm or like people who teased when i was a young girl and i grew up to be totally the opposite but like your daughter you know i was like 

542.11 543.19 B: mhm 

544.27 545.35 B: yeah 

547.00 548.10 B: mhm 

549.98 554.30 A: always amazed at how mean someone or you know a mean joke would really 

554.03 554.94 B: mhm 

554.39 560.09 A: embarrass me or offend me you know but there were those girls that were making the jokes you know 

555.51 556.61 B: yeah 

559.57 560.65 B: mhm 

560.50 566.61 A: so i guess like i i don't know if their parent were just even harder on them or something like that where they 

566.33 567.36 B: mhm 

566.79 568.92 A: kinda toughened their skin toughened up 

568.85 569.93 B: yeah 

569.34 570.56 A: (( a- against it or )) 

570.58 575.62 A: (( something like that )) 

572.05 578.31 B: oh i wonder what they do with our um calls [laughter] i wonder what they do with our calls 

575.90 576.97 A: what 

578.55 580.43 A: i guess they analyze them 

580.35 584.47 B: just to see what we think about things and where the conversation goes 

583.86 587.67 A: yeah i think they they're trying to see like how how it's 

587.77 589.97 A: or speech patterns really 

589.34 593.09 B: mhm because the topic is always different 

590.62 591.80 A: (( i'm not sure )) 

592.87 594.74 A: yeah have you done it a bunch of times 

594.41 596.38 B: um this is my second call 

596.39 597.61 A: (( oh yeah )) 

596.88 599.95 B: and uh the last topic was political
