35.61 38.67 B: so what do you thi- the minimum wage 

37.03 38.14 A: minimum wage 

38.29 40.93 A: about minimum wage all right 

41.09 48.96 A: um it is right actually so the the well mechanical lady said it was four uh it was five fifteen an hour 

48.73 49.76 B: yes 

49.48 57.17 A: okay now did she say it was the recent change 'cause i always thought for the longest time always i've always thought it was um five fifteen an hour 

57.42 62.06 B: the me too i mean i would oh i was thinking it was uh 

62.15 63.96 B: more than that but 

63.13 77.70 A: i always thought it was actually five twenty five but i remember being in high school when i was um uh you know just a few years back and i uh [mn] working at the mall and us and the minimum wage it was it was five fifteen so i guess i i guess they really haven't changed it but 

65.25 66.65 B: yeah 

77.81 80.63 A: yeah five fifteen wasn't isn't that great of a 

81.11 90.74 A: [lipsmack] uh of a wage but i'm guessing when you you know when you're like when you're a high school kid like i was and yeah that's y- you get what you you take what you get 

90.56 98.60 B: [lipsmack] [noise] yeah yeah so it's uh uh yeah that's probably all right starting out at that uh you're learning 

96.70 98.82 A: i i think it would be better 

99.18 104.92 A: yeah i think it would be better though if it was five twenty five it sounds like a more rounded number than 

103.98 105.42 B: right right 

105.09 118.60 A: five fifteen it's kind of just a random five fifteen i don't know well i think twenty five would be a more of a rounded better number that could you could add better and you could [mn] i don't know i i think uh n- it's a bit small 

118.54 120.17 B: yeah yeah 

118.97 120.08 A: (( i would say )) 

120.48 130.29 B: yeah i have teenagers that are vixen my youngest is she'll start this summer so i would hope that she makes more than that [laughter] 

120.86 121.54 A: i 

129.44 131.44 A: yeah she what she starts work this summer 

131.32 132.90 B: yeah yeah 

131.96 133.60 A: (( [lipsmack] oh )) 

133.46 146.37 B: so i mean she's gonna be saving and uh i don't know for college and everything 'cause it's getting to where i mean it's so expensive we're not gonna be able to foot the bill for everything so she's gonna 

139.44 140.31 A: uh-huh 

146.25 149.45 B: have to work you know and help out 

149.29 155.13 A: i know how it's it's hard five fifteen i just uh graduated college um in de- this past december 

153.08 154.49 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

154.96 164.78 A: and um being as that i haven't uh i haven't h- found a real job you know since i've graduated this since this past december so it's been like five about yeah it's been about five months 

164.72 179.15 A: it's uh it's difficult and the so i i could just get any random job but my requirement now having been a gr- college graduate i say is at least thirteen fifty and so to hear that people get five fifteen is just 

179.33 188.59 A: th- uh it's it's it's weird for me because i feel just like i'm uh you know if i don't get a job soon i may have to resort to that which saddens me i mean i live back with my parents now so i don't have to 

186.40 187.61 B: yeah 

189.26 197.43 A: i don't have to you know worry about bills like uh rent or anything like that since i live back with my parents since i've graduated since i haven't found a real job yet but it 

192.19 193.53 B: yeah 

197.91 206.60 A: it's [sigh] it's um the economy is not so great right now and so i can't find any jobs and everyone's being fired and oh it's awful but i 

203.86 205.04 B: uh-huh 

205.97 211.87 B: i have a twenty year old that's living with us and uh of course she's working and she's working two jobs 

211.48 224.76 A: oh yeah see and she so she doesn't have like what i don't know like a career yet has yet yeah see neither have i and it's it's really hard right now i i work as a a administrative assistant i i'm a secretary i sit there and [mn] 

212.03 212.96 B: but 

216.24 218.03 B: (( right right [mn] [mn] )) 

225.19 230.68 A: i just i i you know i type things it's re- it's pretty boring and it's not and i don't get [mn] 

227.83 228.87 B: right 

230.79 242.78 A: a lot like i don't get a lot of hours i don't get paid that well i mean i feel as if like i used uh i've been told stories about how in the past if you were a college graduate there were so many jobs out there available but now 

243.12 249.89 A: it's not that easy and it's it's pretty tough on me and now it doesn't even seem like no one even cares if you have a degree or not 

249.96 250.99 B: right 

249.98 258.17 A: but just it that's why i'm trying to do temp jobs like i mean i'm trying do is anything to get me some sort of money you know a- and oh 

258.76 259.76 A: and it it it 

260.03 270.30 A: it's pretty bad and i don't know i mean i don't know how your situation is right now but for me i sit with my parents and try to save up money so i can move somewhere and get and get something good [laughter] 

261.40 262.42 B: (( uh-huh )) 

270.35 271.90 B: yeah yeah 

272.21 279.73 B: yeah we insisted she stay here i mean i don't think she could make it out even 'cause it's low paying jobs you know 

278.67 279.80 A: mhm 

279.94 281.21 B: and uh 

281.47 285.47 B: so really i don't think she could afford a apartment or something like that 

284.06 291.45 A: yeah my parents told me that that that i should stay with them as as long as possible which is true i mean i can't that i can't pay for anything myself with what i have 

288.52 289.43 B: yeah 

291.34 303.41 A: and so you know as long as as possible i should stay with them in my room and i i'm i'm f- perfectly fine with that i don't mind it i like staying with my parents i don't have to pay rent i don't have to pay for food uh you know it it's cool 

298.54 299.78 B: yeah 

303.20 304.12 B: yeah 

303.47 304.32 A: but 

304.79 313.73 A: yeah i i mean i honestly don't have a problem with it but i i mean i would like to be an independent person one day and move out and i my my degree was in broadcasting 

313.76 326.51 A: and um i i wanna do something with the media and so in order for me to do that i have to move to uh new york or l._a. and i wanna li- move to new york but that's the most expensive place in the country to live 

325.79 327.12 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

326.52 338.41 A: and so right now i'm saving up as much as scrounging up the little money i i'm getting in so i can afford a little something if i move to new york and get a job 'cause it's a lot easier to get a job while you're there than 

335.60 336.72 B: yeah 

338.53 340.54 A: not being there 

340.23 343.59 B: yeah yeah that's true 

341.06 342.04 A: (( so )) 

342.21 343.30 A: oh 

343.36 352.44 A: it's so it's it's just difficult for me as a young person i mean i i i you know i understand i'm young and so i i've a long time to save up and do things but 

352.63 356.45 A: [laughter] it's just i want 'em i'm so eager i wanna do it now 

355.26 356.33 B: yeah 

356.37 357.39 B: yeah 

356.51 357.70 A: (( i mean i wish she )) 

358.07 361.25 B: yeah it's uh it is it's hard 

361.29 364.20 B: like i say my youngest is gonna start and i 

364.39 373.74 B: ((  )) 

371.32 372.23 A: (( could make more )) 

374.65 376.50 B: (( actually my first job was when )) 

375.94 376.89 A: (( than than that )) 

377.46 380.54 B: (( i was seventeen i worked at the mall in plano )) 

380.63 381.58 B: but i 

381.71 383.27 B: (( um i thought hey [noise] [noise] )) 

383.08 389.69 A: (( minimum wage but like you said with the economy the way it is i kinda understand it i mean you )) 

389.83 396.29 A: (( know [laughter] so i wish it could be more you know i'd like for it to be more )) 

397.00 407.28 A: but i could understand you know i'm not i'm just standing here uh uh y- in a clothing store and just getting money you know hey that's cool and so then you learn after a while that that's 

404.84 405.72 B: yeah 

407.32 412.46 A: that you know you're earning money and you know it's something that you have to do and it's i mean five fifteen it's 

412.93 423.94 A: it's all right i think i but then my next was again in the mall still but i i i just moved up to the the second story and i got five twenty five there and i thought that was a big deal [mn] 

414.00 415.00 B: yeah 

424.63 429.84 A: five twenty five whoa big deal but i don't know what w- what exactly do you do now do you do you 

427.28 428.17 B: yeah
