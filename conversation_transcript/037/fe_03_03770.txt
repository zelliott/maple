0.90 2.08 B: hello 

2.55 3.74 A: hello 

3.89 5.97 B: hi my name is sara what's your name 

6.05 8.46 A: my name is joan i didn't get your name 

8.22 9.28 B: sara 

8.98 10.68 A: oh sara mhm 

9.83 10.66 B: yes 

10.83 11.52 B: [mn] 

10.94 13.48 A: so what have you got to say about this topic 

13.18 24.73 B: um well as in how how do we distinguish between humor that's gone too far and stuff that's in good taste um you know i'm pretty conservative myself and 

18.68 19.69 A: mhm 

24.83 29.61 B: you know it seems like [sigh] jokes that don't go too far 

29.67 37.77 B: [laughter] i don't know it's hard to hard to really talk about i guess um you know at at work it seems like 

37.79 47.94 B: people uh most of the jokes don't really seem to bother me to tell you the truth but well i guess there's some that could go too far if you if you talk about 

47.90 50.93 B: somebody's race probably or 

50.82 58.06 B: you know if you talk about somebody's sexual orientation or things like that i know sometimes people can get offended by that 

57.96 69.11 B: um you know most of the stuff doesn't really seem to bother me for some reason i guess [laughter] i guess uh i mean i don't know i maybe you have a view [laughter] 

63.34 64.19 A: (( [laughter] )) 

68.29 78.31 A: well it it's a rather difficult uh topic for me too i i think a lot depends upon the context i mean if if you would go out somewhere 

78.56 79.26 B: mm 

79.10 88.68 A: uh when you're going out for the evening with friends or something it depends on the on the atmosphere sometimes you just have to be quiet and ignore it 

88.21 89.45 B: right 

88.88 93.50 A: so but if you're in a in the business setting or or uh 

93.74 95.83 A: family setting i uh 

95.87 99.29 A: i don't appreciate jokes that uh 

99.33 101.80 A: that aren't to me humorous 

101.45 108.65 B: you're right you know it seems like it does depend on the company that you're keeping at the time too you're right it's 

102.38 103.26 A: i think 

106.89 121.33 A: mhm yeah a- after all if you've put yourself in the position where you are with these people then uh then you you can't very well uh be indignant about it you just have to ignore it and uh next time don't get yourself in the same situation [laughter] 

120.70 127.81 B: right [noise] yeah if they are constantly telling jokes that bother you you uh wouldn't want to hang out with them [laughter] 

124.37 125.36 A: mhm 

126.04 130.84 A: no no you don't of course i'm very conservative about this too i'm 

130.94 140.71 A: i'm in my seventies and i'm not uh [laughter] not used to all the language that a lot of these younger people feel that they are free to use 

134.14 135.32 B: uh-huh 

140.40 142.20 B: (( oh yeah [mn] i )) 

141.31 150.88 A: and so many uh young people they haven't been taught what what is appropriate to do or how to act in front of other people you know older people 

149.26 155.62 B: think mhm i think some of our society is kinda falling apart a little bit [laughter] and 

154.16 157.64 A: oh i think it's all falling apart [laughter] 

156.00 168.36 B: i mean i myself i'm pretty young too i i'm only twenty seven but i'm really very conservative for my age and i actually get offended by a lot of the younger people that are out there [laughter] 

160.11 161.02 A: mhm 

161.74 162.83 A: mhm 

162.86 163.93 A: mhm 

166.75 167.63 A: mhm 

167.73 179.22 A: oh oh i do too i think if if anybody's young enough if they're if they're teenagers or something they should be told that that what they're saying what they're doing the jokes they're making are not appropriate uh 

174.44 175.42 B: yeah 

179.84 192.13 A: to to use and and many of them have never been told that and they don't realize it they don't realize the different situations they're in and and uh after all look at everything that they read and and watch and listen to 

184.33 185.31 B: yeah 

192.15 203.70 B: yeah i i have to agree i mean i think there are a lot of people you know parents are really teaching them what's right and wrong necessarily you know what i mean like i'm sure there's a lot of great parents out there but there's a lot 

200.89 202.00 A: mhm 

203.80 215.89 B: that aren't teaching their kids you know what's acceptable and what's not and how to act in public and and so they're they're growing up and then having kids of their own and not teaching them either [laughter] 

206.96 207.99 A: mhm 

214.64 221.99 A: mhm well that's right it's he- it's hereditary [laughter] if if your mother's never taught you then you aren't going to teach your kids 

221.85 233.76 B: i was actually ap- appalled i mean this is and it seems like we're getting off of the subject a little bit but i was appalled to hear a little you know he he couldn't have been like more than six years old saying the f. word one day in a parking lot 

233.50 242.71 A: well he probably heard his father or and his and his family's friends saying it and so he doesn't know that that's not appropriate 

238.02 239.37 B: yeah 

241.92 244.51 B: he thinks it's okay to say it you know 

243.81 248.77 A: mhm anything they hear their elders do they they feel that uh is okay 

248.62 262.46 B: and see i truthfully you know when i was um probably in high school i used to curse a lot more back then and and it took getting married to my husband and him teaching me that it wasn't acceptable around him for me to really learn that 

254.44 255.74 A: mhm 

260.15 261.38 A: mhm 

261.97 264.35 A: mhm yeah and 

262.50 265.67 B: so that's something that i didn't realize at first 

265.06 272.43 A: yes and i i think uh w- all the things that the that the kids see on television in certain programs 

272.38 274.35 A: and things like that that uh 

274.31 288.65 A: they just don't have any concept that it isn't okay they think oh it's all right because they see see 'em talking that way so it's okay for me to do it and nobody seems to uh tell them any differently so they think it's fine 

283.24 284.61 B: mhm 

287.17 288.33 B: (( yeah )) 

288.78 298.26 A: uh i remember one radio host uh or no television host he was and uh one of the late night ones and uh 

296.71 297.62 B: uh-huh 

298.64 299.82 A: he uh 

299.85 314.19 A: had had a daytime show and on his night show he was all right but i had then i watched this daytime show of his and he as so vulgar he made so many vulgar jokes on the daytime show that that i lost respect for him 

304.16 305.05 B: mhm 

311.28 312.40 B: oh wow 

313.87 314.79 B: (( mm )) 

314.58 328.22 A: i i was very surprised to to think that uh that he would be so vulgar on the on the daytime uh program you'd think it would be just the opposite it would be the night show that he would be circumspect on but it wasn't 

325.31 327.18 B: really yeah 

327.98 330.48 A: and uh so i just uh 

330.50 332.82 A: lost my respect for him [laughter] 

332.23 341.23 B: i think there's so many people in hollywood that feel that they shouldn't be themselves that they have to cater to specific audiences nowadays so when they 

341.20 352.30 B: start doing things like that they think that they're doing it for a good reason that everybody's gonna like them better but it turns out that [noise] they're probably like you said losing respect 

352.26 358.72 B: especially if their if their audiences members who are watching their night time show turned around and watched the daytime show 

358.46 360.32 A: mhm mhm 

359.36 368.68 B: i i feel like you know that you don't have to speak vulgary uh which he's doing using vulgar language to get your point across you can you 

364.33 365.05 A: (( [cough] )) 

366.24 367.30 A: mhm 

369.06 375.41 B: know say things in a less you know more civil manner and still get just as much impact 

370.49 371.48 A: mhm 

373.48 374.37 A: mhm 

375.65 376.54 A: mhm 

375.66 381.07 B: so i think you know a lot of people aren't realizing that nowadays [laughter] 

380.63 391.39 A: oh yeah that that's right but i was really shocked at this at this announcer to to think that he would uh [laughter] oh i had a friend who had some children visiting her her grandchildren and she uh 

384.72 385.92 B: oh yeah 

391.37 393.10 A: uh she had never 

392.97 407.65 A: taken the time to tune into any daytime shows but she thought it will entertain the kiddies [laughter] and she put some of these shows on and she was absolutely horrified to to you know to think that [laughter] what they were saying on it on them and uh 

395.79 396.84 B: (( oh yeah )) 

398.12 399.61 B: (( oh no )) 

407.56 413.19 A: shocked to think of that and and she turned 'em off pretty quick for her grandkids [laughter] 

412.43 413.34 B: yeah i 

413.29 414.40 B: i can imagine 

414.40 424.82 B: well i remember when i was younger my mom used to forbid us to watch certain shows and we used to think she was being so cruel and unfair now that i'm a mother myself i 

421.76 422.84 A: mhm 

423.62 424.62 A: mhm 

424.83 433.94 B: totally understand why she would do that there are some shows that come on now that i say to my husband my goodness you know what are watching in front of our children 

433.71 434.75 A: mhm 

434.16 440.80 B: and so now a lot of times we'll have the kids either leave the room or else we'll change the channel you know 

438.40 439.30 A: mhm 

440.24 452.31 A: mhm another old friend of mine who was visiting uh wanted to get some videos and so we went to the store and uh she's very you know very conservative and uh 

451.21 452.38 B: mhm 

452.19 464.49 A: she picked out a video she said oh this one won the academy award and it won all these other awards so this must be a wonderful one we should get this to watch and i ke- i saw it was r. rated and i thought 

464.27 471.07 A: this is going to shock her terribly she won't like this [laughter] and she brought it home and she put it in and after about the first uh 

471.04 483.82 A: uh three minutes of the of the show when she heard the foul language and and everything she was absolutely outraged she yanked it out of the v._c._r. and she took it right back and got her money back [laughter] on it 

483.99 485.21 B: right 

484.21 492.41 A: she couldn't believe that that something that would win an academy award would have such vulgar language in it and and uh things like that [laughter] 

492.25 502.13 B: yeah you wouldn't believe it happens but it does it i mean like every like like you said earlier society's just crumbling apart [laughter] 

495.32 496.60 A: mhm 

500.80 514.18 A: mhm well i took another friend to a movie to see robin williams and and i had watched that martian program with him and it was nice comedy and i thought oh i'm gonna t- she hadn't been to a drive in movie in 

504.46 505.40 B: uh-huh

523.21 530.52 A: he's a nice comic she'll enjoy that well i never thought to look at the fine print and see that this is an r. rated picture 

529.50 533.30 B: is that that one where he's a crazy person 

530.95 536.30 A: and she was so shocked i don't think she'll go to another movie for another thirty years [laughter] 

536.01 543.21 B: is that the one where he decided to go away from comedy and play a really crazy person taking pictures of people 

543.14 549.62 A: i can't recall now 'cause it was a number of years ago but i was totally surprised when i 

546.46 547.48 B: oh

549.53 562.46 A: [laughter] and then uh and then i know a lady who who who picked up a a a wonderful movie she thought to entertain her friends at home and uh who were visiting her and she said she put it in

571.65 579.70 A: bad jokes in it and and uh foul language [laughter] and it embarrassed her to think she had shown it to her friends at home
