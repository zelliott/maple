15.04 17.61 B: i guess we talk we need to talk about what 

17.47 20.75 A: [laughter] i didn't understand the question 

18.20 19.89 B: (( because i didn't understand something el- )) 

20.78 21.61 B: huh 

21.47 23.83 A: i didn't understand the question 

23.43 31.36 B: i guess you know they're asking is the minimum wage if they're if our national minimum wage at five dollars and fifteen cents sufficient is it enough 

32.02 36.27 B: i have an opinion about the minimum wage system hm let me tell ya [laughter] 

32.25 32.90 A: (( [mn] )) 

35.63 44.22 A: mm my husband works at a grocery store he makes five fifty but yeah we could use a little more 

41.39 42.46 B: mhm 

44.91 46.03 B: yeah 

46.12 49.58 B: but do you know the the well the main problem with the 

49.64 63.33 B: the minimum wage that is essentially what is causing inflation because once everybody's making a high minimum wage you know every time they boost it up everything else gets increased in price 'cause they think oh everybody's making more money but they're not 

50.89 51.61 A: mm 

63.87 67.87 B: you know if you're barely about minimum wage like your husband is 

63.88 64.72 A: mm 

67.58 69.17 A: mhm 

68.14 79.12 B: it doesn't help that everybody else is inching closer to his income 'cause then they raise prices all over because they they assume that everybody get ra- gets raises but it's only 

79.39 83.22 B: like teenagers are getting these raises you know minimum wage 

82.76 85.21 A: mhm 

83.66 86.57 B: and i i just think it's i have a problem with that

93.60 95.10 A: yeah 

93.81 101.48 B: so that's my opinion on that [laughter] i i i it causes inflation i believe because everything goes up 

96.19 97.25 A: (( [laughter] )) 

101.65 102.87 B: every time 

102.93 109.47 B: it's been proven i've i've been reading on this and uh my husband and i have discussed this huh

191.25 192.08 B: (( but [noise] )) 

193.28 195.97 B: anyway see i just i just think that the 

196.32 200.34 B: i think it really does hurt every time they raise the minimum wage it hurts everybody else 

199.30 202.68 A: yeah it does 

200.90 214.69 B: i mean yeah it helps everybody working minimum wage but who's working minimum wage mostly it's migrant workers and people just entering the workforce like teenagers you know they'll work for anything i know i used to be one [laughter] 

207.20 208.03 A: mm 

214.05 214.98 A: (( mm )) 

215.02 216.22 B: and so 

216.63 218.43 B: that's the only 

219.68 222.82 B: i i just believe that it hurts everybody else that you know 

223.17 228.03 B: has a family and and everything 'cause you know i have a new baby and 

224.67 226.74 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

227.43 228.82 A: oh 

228.54 232.74 B: four month old baby and a five year old son that's gonna be six in a month [sigh] 

232.56 234.04 A: oh my 

233.90 235.13 B: so 

235.19 244.13 B: yeah it and i know what it's like to work at minimum wage and yeah it'd be great if you were a teenager 'cause you don't have to care you know you don't have to worry about the bills and 

244.17 245.32 A: right 

244.23 247.52 B: and getting stuff for kids and everything and 

246.93 248.44 A: (( that's right )) 

248.41 251.92 B: but every time they raise the minimum wage gosh i remember it being you know 

252.19 254.21 A: mhm 

252.62 258.93 B: well probably when i entered the workforce it was about thr- three fifty about ten years ago and 

256.55 257.68 A: mhm 

259.69 262.13 B: i thought that was pretty good [laughter] 

261.40 264.40 A: yeah 

262.28 267.36 B: and i mean y- they they they they believe that by raising the minimum wage 

267.70 272.93 B: that it's going to help for the standard of life for all of those that are working the minimum wage 

273.01 282.24 B: and it does temporarily but everything catches up everything you know is raised up to the level and that's why they have to keep increasing it and 

274.46 275.44 A: (( mm [mn] )) 

276.97 277.99 A: right 

282.56 288.68 B: it's just spiraling out of control i believe it just it's because i think it's actually causing 

289.08 293.29 B: inflation it is it's the root of r- the root of inflation 

290.38 290.96 A: (( mm )) 

291.52 292.73 A: (( mhm )) 

294.13 295.04 B: so
