158.30 159.42 B: [sigh] you 

163.72 165.84 A: [sigh] they're a little more mainstream 

166.39 171.12 A: there's there's it's it's a very complicated thing 'cause like you can generally 

171.53 181.81 A: uh you can generally cleave islam into two groups shiite and sunni but there's another camp called reform um which kind of are neither 

176.03 177.03 B: right 

179.41 180.41 B: (( uh-huh )) 

181.72 182.73 B: uh-huh

184.50 185.91 B: right 

185.29 194.45 A: and like you know the shiite sunni thing is more of a political schism whereas the reform and traditionalist is more of an ideological schism 

195.25 198.29 A: but we've completely [laughter] gone off topic 

197.13 197.61 B: (( [sigh] )) 

197.57 198.04 B: well 

198.04 205.02 B: so the thing is no no no we we haven't gone off topic because humor is about the about 

205.03 219.36 B: the anxiety i think and the uh laughing at oneself and other people laughing at you and uh is the laugh uh attacking you so if i 

217.88 218.65 A: i 

219.26 233.92 B: you know uh i could uh i'm i'm a jew so i can tell i i think sometimes you know some people say that uh if i tell a joke that uh listen uh a jewish guy walks into a uh bar

389.14 390.53 B: (( [noise] right )) 

395.17 396.47 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh ))

404.67 409.60 A: if you put me on hold there's a good possibility that the call will get disconnected 

408.98 410.84 B: okay so forget it 

410.11 412.30 A: because i think that they monitor 

411.13 416.10 B: it'll yeah it'll just it'll just go to uh it'll just go to uh 

416.25 417.72 B: to the voice mail

422.02 424.96 B: right right right right 

424.36 430.26 A: yeah [sigh] but a good a good thing to do i think next time round is to say that you're on a cell 

425.05 426.52 B: (( [sigh] uh )) 

429.63 431.00 B: right 

430.32 435.32 A: and that way if it drops um it won't um it'll be taken as a 

435.34 439.59 A: disconnected call rather than uh you put me on hold and the line voltage dropped and 

437.76 441.95 B: right well listen that's okay though they can call me back 

441.32 443.96 A: i went and downloaded the software that does this 

443.73 444.72 B: uh-huh 

444.38 447.04 A: and speaking about humor it's very badly 

447.33 450.42 A: written [cough] [sigh] [laughter] 

449.49 459.06 B: what's badly written the software yeah but that's all that but that's an inside joke since you i don't understand it at all so that's completely an inside joke 

450.67 451.98 A: (( the software )) 

451.99 453.98 A: there's a there's a computer that 

454.77 455.61 A: yes

471.25 474.43 B: (( right n- so uh so )) 

475.47 487.06 A: [laughter] anyway uh humor um yeah you gotta check out bill hicks he really pushes the envelope of good taste [laughter] he he goes he basically goes off on this tangent 

479.69 481.84 B: (( uh i i i'll i'll look at him )) 

482.13 483.28 B: okay 

487.17 492.15 A: where he uh he he basically [laughter] refers to g- george bush uh 

492.19 495.03 A: george herbert walker bush as the scat muncher

508.94 509.99 B: uh-huh 

509.83 513.62 A: and it's just very very funny it sounds disgusting i guess 

513.74 516.76 A: if you look at it from the thirty thousand foot view 

516.62 523.50 A: but once you get in there [laughter] and you listen to the skit it's it's wrong he just keeps keeps pushing it and pushing it and pushing it and pushing it 

519.68 520.55 B: uh-huh 

521.84 523.04 B: right 

523.30 536.26 A: and it's really exemplary of the topic [laughter] that we're supposed to be talking 'cause like it's all funny for everyone and then you're listening to it it's a live recording and you can hear the audience begin to drop off 

530.30 531.59 B: right
