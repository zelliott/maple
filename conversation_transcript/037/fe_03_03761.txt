126.03 128.05 B: oh yeah 

127.16 130.86 A: so uh you know minimum wage doesn't affect me so 

131.22 132.85 B: yeah they kind of um 

133.66 141.89 B: the uh whole television industry kinda has a cap on it where they could get away paying you a certain amount i don't know how they do it a certain amount a day 

142.01 144.88 B: and then you could work as many hours as they need you 

145.55 146.86 A: oh 

147.22 148.49 B: yeah i don't know how 

147.44 149.09 A: (( that sounds good )) 

148.82 155.27 B: yeah i don't know how they get away with it but it's uh it could be beneficial or it could totally kill you so 

155.46 160.11 A: yeah if you work four hours it's it'd be nice but if you worked fifteen 

155.77 156.33 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

160.01 163.42 B: yeah which on like a taping day 

163.58 166.23 B: fourteen fifteen hours is like the usual day 

167.16 168.23 A: wow [mn] 

168.19 172.35 B: yeah so it's pretty crazy but i don't know how they get away with it 

173.65 175.60 A: yeah 

175.07 183.90 B: interesting but i don't know it i don't think fif- it seems like five dollars and fifteen cents wouldn't be enough money for someone to even get by on 

184.13 185.62 A: (( no [laughter] )) 

185.93 191.38 A: it's barely enough you know you gotta work three three and a half hours just to buy a tank of gas 

191.31 192.87 B: (( [laughter] yeah for real )) 

192.84 193.99 A: (( [laughter] )) 

193.84 197.06 B: especially now the gas going all crazy 

196.85 198.34 A: oh yeah 

197.92 199.74 B: it's been going down a little bit though 

199.72 201.51 A: yeah that's been nice 

201.69 203.84 B: yeah it's pretty cool but still 

204.27 209.75 B: five dollars and fifteen cents with uh the cost of living is it's just nothing 

206.64 207.31 A: (( [noise] )) 

209.90 211.05 A: no 

211.35 217.10 A: i mean up here you can find a real cheap apartment for five fifty a month but that's like um 

217.32 219.71 A: you know ghetto land or whatever [laughter] 

219.51 221.45 B: right 

220.66 225.36 A: but uh down in uh like the l._a. area i'm sure it's probably 

225.67 227.38 A: a lot more expensive [laughter] 

227.51 231.60 B: well you could um about seven hundred dollars you're looking at the ghetto apartments 

233.07 243.97 B: i actually just moved about a month ago so it was crazy and i was i don't think that if i if i made five dollars and fifteen cents an hour i'd be like living out of my car 

244.27 246.22 A: yeah no kidding 

246.00 248.20 B: and still probably couldn't make it [laughter] 

248.59 250.49 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

250.60 252.86 A: jeeze you'd have to work uh 

253.65 258.93 A: over a hundred hours you'd have to work like a hundred and fifty hours just for rent 

259.32 260.99 B: yeah that's just nuts 

261.48 268.15 A: and most people only uh you know you figure you would work forty hours a week a hundred and sixty hours uh 

268.33 269.95 A: a month you know 

270.12 273.04 A: [laughter] i don't see how you you couldn't pay for food 

273.32 277.14 B: right and plus you'd be working so much you wouldn't even see your apartment 

276.76 278.30 A: yeah exactly 

277.72 280.74 B: [laughter] you might as well live out of your car 

280.71 282.02 A: yeah 

282.72 287.77 B: that is i don't know i don't know where they get that number either five dollars and fifteen cents 

286.38 287.39 A: yeah 

289.24 291.05 A: it's strange 

291.07 292.72 B: i don't think it's been i 

291.59 292.23 A: and 

293.16 295.11 B: don't think it's been that low in a long time 

295.02 299.26 A: yeah uh the system could be outdated on the topic so 

299.88 303.46 B: this is true maybe they're just giving us something to talk about 

304.31 307.94 A: yeah that's probably the case they probably wanted us to talk about what the heck 

307.87 309.45 B: yeah [laughter] 

308.18 309.81 A: (( five dollars you know )) 

310.17 311.72 A: it's higher up here 

311.57 315.44 B: (( yeah and i remember when i got out of high school it was three fifty )) 

315.67 317.33 A: yeah exactly 

317.23 318.36 B: (( it was crazy )) 

319.49 321.27 A: (( three fifty an hour )) 

322.15 323.22 B: that just 

323.48 324.98 B: that seems illegal 

325.36 326.92 A: yeah 

326.62 330.14 B: now that i'm you know you move up a little bit and you're going damn 

330.20 333.10 B: you know what i couldn't even remember making that little money 

333.80 342.74 A: well yeah and then you oh that's gotta suck for you know somebody who's making that much 'cause then they gotta take social security and all that crap out of it 

338.63 340.04 B: yeah 

343.93 346.18 A: and they're [laughter] left with nothing 

347.15 353.76 B: yeah and then there's and if somebody you know these these people working in fast food places or whatever if they have a family they're done 

354.04 355.70 A: yeah 

355.85 357.09 B: that's crazy 

356.10 359.00 A: or at least you couldn't make it 

358.54 360.55 B: yeah i'd rather uh [laughter] 

360.66 362.27 B: collect unemployment [laughter] 

362.75 368.13 A: yeah unemployment's [laughter] better than that that's pretty bad 

367.74 371.19 B: (( yeah 'cause the uh )) 

371.70 376.58 B: the ri- the rise of uh criminal behavior because of minimum wage 

377.06 380.50 A: yeah seriously man that's what makes people go sell pot 

380.38 382.51 B: right [laughter] exactly 

383.04 387.49 B: why wouldn't why wouldn't you do that if you're making five dollars 

385.98 387.11 A: yeah maybe 

388.06 394.41 A: you can you can make five dollars an hour and then you can go sell pot or something on the street just to get by 

394.92 399.57 B: you could you could make like a hundred dollars in like five minutes 

399.73 402.22 A: yeah no kidding 

400.61 401.97 B: [laughter] 

403.02 408.72 A: or if you're really good you can make uh you know if you're doing big deals or whatever [laughter] you could make a 

407.33 408.48 B: (( right so you )) 

409.24 411.67 A: thousand dollars in five minutes 

411.62 418.00 B: that's what i'm talking about now weigh the weigh that five dollars thousand hm 

416.85 417.99 A: yeah [laughter] 

418.86 424.28 A: then you don't got to uh you know deal with people yelling at you you screwed up my order 

424.48 432.46 B: for real so the risk is you either go to jail which is a there's a a percentage of an opportunity you're gonna get caught or 

432.57 433.58 B: you you 

433.94 439.06 B: get the five dollars and fifteen cents and it's like being in prison anyway [laughter] 

437.79 441.67 A: yeah it's like uh go to jail or get evicted basically 

441.95 445.03 B: it's as broad as it is long well 

445.09 446.37 A: (( oh that's horrible )) 

445.37 449.73 B: actually i think selling pot is actually probably more beneficial 

450.25 451.53 A: yeah really 

451.72 454.86 B: especially in the long run [laughter] 

453.80 454.74 A: yeah 

455.28 456.94 B: that's crazy 

456.64 462.10 A: well i mean you don't know it's it's illegal is it immoral that's the question 

462.83 463.65 B: (( but )) 

464.84 468.71 B: is five dollars and fifteen cents immoral [laughter] 

467.76 471.86 A: hell yeah [laughter] that is way immoral 

471.52 473.18 B: right it's it's like uh 

473.25 478.18 B: paying those korean kids over there to make sweatshirts or whatever those sweatshops 

478.78 481.94 A: dude i bet that's probably what they get paid an hour 

482.15 482.93 A: [laughter] 

483.32 484.56 B: that's crazy 

483.65 487.70 A: maybe maybe a buck or two less but 

486.96 491.92 B: well compared to what everybody like i don't know the percentage of people make in the united states 

492.09 494.71 B: five dollars and fifteen cents would be the same thing 

495.86 496.84 A: yeah 

496.12 506.83 B: with it's like yeah i just these little korean kids are these the the poor people making us food and stuff just five dollars and fifteen cents because they need the money 

507.20 511.77 A: well yeah if they're gonna pay that low they should be letting little kids work you know 

511.45 514.52 B: [laughter] exactly 

512.83 519.76 A: 'cause i mean you know it's ok- it's okay for like a twelve year old to make that much but you know in there like uh 

517.11 518.76 B: [laughter] 

520.06 523.93 A: like nineteen twenty range [laughter] you know i 

522.86 525.37 B: right when you get some bills

535.99 537.67 B: [laughter] 

538.36 539.58 A: [laughter] 

539.36 540.65 B: that's funny 

541.16 542.87 B: like go make me a cheeseburger 

544.29 546.45 A: yeah that's about right 

546.48 549.11 B: is this uh um the first time you've done one of these

585.88 587.57 A: yeah 

588.04 589.42 A: (( but uh i )) 

589.50 595.23 A: think they're using this for like some voice recognition development or something uh fancy like that 

595.28 598.42 B: [laughter] that's funny the voice recognition
