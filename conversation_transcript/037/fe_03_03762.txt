0.00 2.81 A: hi i'm matt i'm from seattle 

2.42 6.43 B: hi this is mike i'm from fort wayne indiana 

6.69 7.93 A: (( hey how you doing )) 

7.46 9.24 B: hey pretty good 

10.03 13.91 B: my wife set me up for this so i thought we'd give it a try 

13.90 17.77 A: yeah it's a pretty cool uh concept ten bucks a call 

15.10 16.26 B: [laughter] 

17.35 18.53 B: right 

18.14 19.76 A: (( not bad )) 

19.00 22.74 B: so let's see i guess we're supposed to stick to the minimum wage issue 

22.95 24.92 A: yeah 

24.04 26.16 B: um [laughter] 

26.63 33.50 B: not really current news i guess but or major news but i guess in general i guess that i i 

33.54 37.32 B: just feel there shouldn't be a minimum wage so i guess i would be 

37.45 44.20 B: so i guess the question was do i think it's sufficient i think uh yeah it's sufficient [laughter] it's more than sufficient 

44.09 48.63 A: yeah i kinda have the same feelings about minimum wage you know it kind of uh 

45.72 46.46 B: (( uh )) 

49.23 54.96 A: you know decreases available jobs and you know if somebody wants to pay three bucks an hour 

52.11 53.01 B: sure 

55.40 59.37 A: you know they're gonna get somebody who's gonna wanna work for three bucks an hour 

58.76 69.70 B: right you know it just keeps other other people out of the market if you raise it too high you'll just get less people starting out and it just makes a higher threshold for starting out 

69.81 73.03 A: yeah and it also just increases inflation 

73.17 74.50 B: right 

74.47 78.73 A: but i don't i don't know where they get the five fifteen figure from though 

77.03 78.22 B: [laughter] 

79.30 89.16 A: 'cause i know up here in uh in washington anyway i i think it's like a federally uh done thing but it i think it just went up to seven oh one 

79.31 80.55 B: yeah 

88.92 92.35 B: oh boy then it's even higher there than the federal minimum 

92.91 96.11 A: yeah i don't know if that's the case or uh what 

95.14 96.04 B: [laughter] 

97.19 100.51 B: i don't yeah i don't think it's that way here in indiana but 

101.06 104.25 B: i i don't know that way in indianapolis but hm 

105.30 108.94 B: well it doesn't think sound like we have too much argument [laughter] 

108.09 109.73 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

110.62 117.58 B: well it's an unusual view for someone from seattle [laughter] i thought they up there they probably most people want it to be higher 

113.47 115.10 A: yeah 

117.73 119.69 B: i would think but i don't know 

117.87 127.01 A: yeah oh there's a there's a lot of liberal people who think everything should be controlled centrally by the government including minimum wage 

124.54 130.50 B: yeah but i guess there's people around uh even in indiana [laughter] 

130.35 132.25 A: yeah 

133.14 133.95 B: uh 

134.44 139.26 B: (( well let's see what else can we add to the issue [laughter] )) 

139.20 141.13 A: um well 

139.77 142.71 B: what do you do for a living just for a sidebar 

141.20 142.23 A: um 

142.62 144.79 A: i'm actually an electronics technician 

144.43 145.16 B: (( oh )) 

145.32 146.23 A: i'm 

146.55 150.67 A: self employed so minimum wage doesn't really affect me 

146.73 147.70 B: oh we're 

148.01 149.40 B: very close then 

150.68 151.71 B: yeah i'm in 

150.80 153.70 A: i set my own you know hourly rates 

153.15 154.55 B: oh yeah 

154.15 156.88 A: i do uh like guitar amp repair 

156.27 161.39 B: oh yeah well that would make you think more um independently 

157.14 157.71 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

157.78 158.96 A: so that's uh 

161.72 168.29 B: you know to make make you wanna you know see the minimum wage as not really mandated since you're free to set your own 

166.11 167.94 A: yeah 

169.63 176.60 B: so yeah i mean well i'm an engineer electrical engineer so i do similar kind of stuff work for electronics 

172.36 173.54 A: oh really 

174.12 175.58 A: yeah 

177.65 181.58 A: yeah i'm actually um a college student right now 

181.21 184.21 B: (( oh yeah oh you're just starting out right )) 

181.88 183.87 A: yeah i'm gonna go on and uh 

185.34 186.36 B: (( well i'm a )) 

185.39 188.26 A: start my uh double e. degree 

187.54 192.30 B: oh yeah my one's been aerospace and defense so i've done that for [sigh] 

192.52 194.14 B: for about twenty years now 

193.96 195.14 A: oh wow 

197.94 199.55 B: (( so yeah let's see )) 

199.28 204.29 A: definitely not a uh field that's really affected by minimum wage [laughter] 

203.07 207.34 B: yeah that's true you know that yeah really minimum wage is sort of for people that are 

207.36 213.26 B: working summer jobs or or maybe just starting out with you know no college background so 

213.43 221.79 A: yeah i just uh got offered a job you know working full time doing uh circuit board uh manufacturing 

221.48 222.69 B: yeah 

222.10 224.53 A: like doing you know working in a uh 

224.74 227.40 A: industrial type environment 

226.49 230.70 B: but now are they paying minimum wage or above minimum wage [laughter] 

229.00 233.59 A: oh they were gonna they offered me uh starting like twenty three an hour 

232.85 235.16 B: (( oh yeah oh whoa yeah okay )) 

234.71 242.85 A: 'cause i have you know i have got the uh i._p._c. certifications and for uh you know manufacturing just i got that as part of my uh 

238.14 239.14 B: (( oh )) 

242.32 243.09 B: (( oh )) 

243.02 246.46 A: education through the uh technical college i went to 

248.36 249.53 B: (( yeah well that sounds )) 

250.16 251.21 B: (( good )) 

251.42 254.42 A: so minimum wage doesn't really uh 

253.64 255.87 B: [lipsmack] [laughter] doesn't enter into the picture 

255.83 256.86 A: no 

257.56 265.52 A: which is nice but you gotta kind of feel bad for the people who are uh stuck working you know ma- flipping burgers or whatever 

264.38 268.57 B: right oh well i think mcdonald's pays over minimum wage at least 

268.60 271.99 B: around here i mean they they pay more than that i think 

272.33 276.08 B: most places in fact most places probably pay more than the minimum 

273.29 277.52 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

276.16 282.40 B: but the way it's been lately i don't know about this year but the last couple of years it's been hard to find people [sigh] 

282.51 291.31 B: to do those kind of jobs or any jobs really so it but yeah there i mean there again it's proving the minimum wage doesn't really serve a purpose but 

287.84 290.97 A: (( yeah )) 

291.21 293.26 A: yeah 

292.14 306.48 B: but yeah i have heard you know different arguments about it and it's what it really puts an impediment you know maybe it doesn't it sounds like it doesn't make much difference to the average person but then there's the people that are from you know inner city and you know and poor backgrounds that 

306.42 318.50 B: aren't real desirable candidates to hire and it makes this big threshold that they can't get a job to get started out you know and get get civilized you know so it kinda keeps them out so 

318.47 322.21 B: there they are with no job for you know until they get pretty old 

318.75 321.88 A: (( yeah )) 

322.44 327.66 B: so that's it'd be better if they could be hired for two three bucks an hour just to get 'em started 

322.44 323.95 A: yeah 

327.57 330.19 A: yeah just something to you know get 

328.87 334.10 B: you know get 'em to learn to you know to wake up in the morning and make it into work 

333.99 343.12 A: yeah you know in that kind of job if you're only making that much i'm sure management's a little more uh tolerant about being late 

335.00 336.70 B: (( you know whatever they're doing )) 

337.52 339.10 B: [laughter] but 

340.61 341.92 B: right 

342.31 346.41 B: but that doesn't mean you have to earn that your entire life you know it's just uh 

346.63 352.36 B: your first few months or whatever till you get to get you know some kind of basis for moving on 

352.30 358.32 A: yeah or maybe even uh like start 'em out at that you know and if they uh 

353.60 354.72 B: (( so )) 

357.05 357.99 B: uh-huh 

358.44 363.68 A: prove themselves after a couple couple of months you know bump 'em up to five bucks an hour 

359.48 360.77 B: exactly 

363.08 367.98 B: right or they move on to a different job or you know whatever they wanna do so yeah 

364.17 365.17 A: and then 

367.32 369.07 A: yeah 

370.70 375.99 A: kind of give give uh employers more freedom as opposed to the uh 

374.05 374.95 B: right 

376.14 379.67 A: you know on everything being mandated by the government 

378.40 383.05 B: definitely that's supposed to be that's what freedom's about i thought [laughter] 

382.42 384.24 A: yeah 

384.39 387.63 A: i'm actually a uh member in the libertarian party 

386.72 390.75 B: hey you know i've i'm b- was big in the libertarianism too 

390.88 405.12 B: i've been to their meetings and whatnot it's just they're not so big here in indiana but [sigh] i [laughter] you started to sound very similar you know what what i know yeah i've read a lot of libertarian books so yeah you're right down the same alley 

404.82 406.59 A: yeah 

405.12 407.40 B: what a coincidence [laughter] 

406.86 413.79 A: yeah it's kinda up here in the se- in the seattle area and especially the portland area there's uh 

413.09 416.65 B: you probably have and that's a big enough area you probably have quite a few 

416.63 419.97 A: yeah there's there's a a large amount of libertarians 

419.53 420.60 B: mhm 

419.99 425.75 A: but uh compared to the general population there's a lot of democrats here 

421.60 423.67 B: but percentage wise yeah 

424.85 429.35 B: yeah you'd have to be up to alaska or somewhere where you get a lot of libertarians 

429.21 431.14 A: yeah 

430.17 439.56 B: but and there's some here in fort wayne this is you know mainly republican country but you know we have a small you know we have libertarians on the ballot here so you know there's enough to 

439.72 443.80 B: i think it's a two percent vote i think they get every year to be on the ballot again 

444.12 446.60 A: yeah we've got 'em on the ballot here too 

446.01 447.57 B: so you know it's 

447.72 450.98 B: they haven't really won anything here locally yet but 

451.32 452.56 B: keep hoping 

453.24 462.84 A: yeah up here in washington we actually have some elected into you know public office but i mean it's not like big time positions it's like you know city water commissioner 

453.28 454.22 B: but 

456.79 458.11 B: (( do you oh )) 

460.20 461.12 B: uh-huh 

462.20 463.52 B: oh yeah 

462.90 464.14 A: et cetera 

463.70 466.34 B: it just happens to be a guy that signs up 

466.57 469.69 B: for the position there might not have been any competition 

469.93 470.68 B: uh 

470.09 472.29 A: yeah 

472.75 481.42 A: and then there's people who uh you know they're non partisan racers who uh you know still declare themselves as libertarians 

472.78 473.85 B: (( well )) 

480.73 494.54 B: right well we have some here too that start out libertarian and they switch over to republican and you know it just depends 'cause you you gotta almost have to be republican to get elected to any major office but sometimes there isn't that much difference so 

491.52 493.13 A: yeah well 

493.78 500.12 A: well i found uh libertar- you know when i'm hearing arguments with the democrats versus republicans 

497.62 498.54 B: uh-huh 

499.55 500.59 B: uh-huh 

500.10 510.45 A: you know they always leave libertarians out um i tend to side like you know way more with the republicans i think they're you know a lot more similar in certain areas 

502.10 503.13 B: right 

506.19 507.27 B: right 

509.14 512.13 B: right yeah i you know i try to make the argument that there 

512.19 519.30 B: you know they have some similarities with both and they can drop 'em both but in reality the republicans are probably far closer 

519.46 532.07 B: you know just because they're conservative you know economic you know if the amount of spending goes down i mean that's the republican side but the libertarians are certainly much more for reduction in government than republicans but 

526.49 529.50 A: (( yeah )) 

533.00 534.95 A: yeah 

533.75 546.50 B: but yeah like minimum wage and stuff well republicans would argue keep the minimum the same and you know democrats would wanna raise it well libertarians wanna abolish it so there again there's the the fundamentals are hitting 

542.86 544.37 A: yeah 

546.32 549.17 A: but uh you know out of the three you know 

549.37 554.47 A: if you had to pick one i'd you know i'd go with the republican point of view on that 

553.37 554.30 B: yeah 

554.34 555.72 B: to keep it the same 

555.34 560.60 A: [laughter] uh yeah well you know if i had to choose from you know raise it or keep it the same 

559.62 564.20 B: oh right of the two of the two right right [laughter] 

561.26 563.60 A: no of yeah not out of three 

563.77 565.61 A: sorry [laughter] 

564.45 566.11 B: right right i'm with ya 

566.24 570.32 B: so yeah yeah that's well that's where i'd you know that's what i generally vote but 

570.56 581.72 B: if it seems like there's a republican gonna win it then i vote libertarian [laughter] because i wanna poll them more with libertarian but if it looks like a democrat's gonna win i'm gonna vote republican you gotta be always one notch below 

581.53 583.53 A: yeah exactly 

582.03 587.23 B: just to make your vote count [laughter] but so yeah 

587.20 592.42 A: yeah it's uh up here's you know democrat country basically lots of liberals 

590.26 591.15 B: right 

592.62 593.54 B: (( yeah )) 

592.90 596.75 A: and there's even uh what's his name la ruche 

596.36 599.89 B: oh yeah i know him he's a pretty wild character yeah 

597.25 597.92 A: (( la ruche )) 

598.34 599.95 A: familiar with
