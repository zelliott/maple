46.71 48.22 A: hopefully it goes through 

48.27 63.14 B: [laughter] well shoot yeah if you get a great place in soho it's worth it and corporate scam i don't know let me see do we have to let me think how much i need to talk about corporate scandal uh yeah corporate scandals is bad and i don't think we can do anything about it [laughter] 

63.64 64.58 B: that would be 

63.79 75.79 A: yeah [laughter] well to me it just is gonna take a you know there's no amount of regulation that you can enforce on it that is gonna stop corporations from behaving the way they do 

75.55 79.68 B: (( well other than you know uh first of all i don't think there's anything particularly )) 

79.80 92.40 B: wrong with it because you know they're in business to make money and if you're gonna tell them you're trying to make money um they're gonna do whatever's necessary to make it uh [lipsmack] 

92.63 94.89 B: [sigh] you know you i i 

93.37 101.21 A: yeah well but there are kind but when they do the things like enron what they did was they took the um 

101.41 105.16 A: some of the expenses and put them in a different category 

104.87 111.49 B: yeah but everybody does that everybody does it you work in a film you ever do any work in film 

111.79 112.60 A: no 

112.46 116.51 B: um film is a very creative industry and you're 

116.39 130.63 B: the thing you're doing all the time is you're looking at your budget and you're saying okay i need to make this money i'm gonna take need to take this and put this over here i think where where i thought they were screwing up is probably in terms of whe- where you're looking at investors 

130.69 142.22 B: if you got investors you need to be to some degree you need to be accurate for your investors uh and that's where enron was was screwing up but yeah i uh [noise] that's that's just part of the game 

135.80 136.62 A: yeah 

142.54 155.37 B: you know you you manipulate money all the time it's it's if if the accountant isn't doing it uh they're asking him why they didn't why he's why he didn't do it 

142.92 144.30 A: well i mean it's 

155.91 166.82 A: but the but the way they're manipulating money misleads investors to think that the company is not in debt when it really is and it's just prolonging that debt 

156.02 156.92 B: (( you know )) 

167.98 171.28 B: m- oh uh yeah but you know i 

171.48 173.81 B: see i don't look at it as though the 

174.02 184.34 B: their initial goal is to make sure that they rob people their initial goal is to make money and a lot of times in business you really just trying to hold off until 

179.93 180.74 A: mhm 

185.07 194.01 B: what you're expecting to come in comes in you know your goal isn't to rob the people who investing your goal is to actually make the money that you think you're gonna make 

194.04 203.12 B: uh the end result is sometimes you have to lie to make sure that people aren't pulling their money out before you're actually making that money 

194.09 195.17 A: mhm 

203.57 204.43 A: mhm 

203.72 211.03 B: that i [mn] you know is is it wrong absolutely but it it's kinda understandable where it's coming from 

210.42 215.67 A: yeah i mean if it was me you know there's a difference between like morals and the law 

216.14 217.02 A: that 

217.35 231.19 A: like it was you know if it was my company of course i'd try to prolong the debt as long as possible and um try to retain as many of my investors um so they wouldn't pull out and maybe i could pull through this 

231.75 232.69 B: yeah but 

231.89 241.45 A: ho- however as an investor i'd like the company to be forthright and completely honest with me uh by what i'm investing in 

241.19 253.71 B: right but you know if you're looking at it from an investor's standpoint yeah i'm gonna say i'm wan- i wanna know what risk i'm actually taking so that i can agree or not agree to stay with you 

254.12 259.50 B: the problem is again is you know what's unfortunately with people 

259.33 261.23 B: when you're honest with them the- 

261.05 272.67 B: they're not rational it- if you could be if you could get people to be rational when you're being honest you'd say oh there's no problem you say okay listen here's the risk 

272.53 276.77 B: here's what we're looking at here's how we plan on getting out of this and you know 

276.53 288.98 B: and this is this is what we're going to attempt but most people won't listen to that as soon as they hear that there is a risk they already think the stock market is a risky business as soon as they hear that there's 

288.78 294.02 B: there is more than they thought initially then they're pulling out now 

294.10 299.97 B: wh- what was at one point just the risk now becomes a guaranteed failure 

300.07 301.22 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

300.66 304.31 B: and you as as a business owner you can't take the guaranteed failure 

304.44 305.71 B: you can't 

306.23 316.90 B: you can't and what's be it for america or or strictly for the individual you have to say listen you know what let me just take that risk and just keep it solid 

317.15 320.31 B: if only for a little while you know 

320.09 321.13 A: mhm 

320.78 323.26 B: so that i can keep uh uh 

323.55 331.12 B: um my investors happy uh and possibly those who jump out early you know like as in the case of what's her name martha 

331.17 336.12 B: uh i can i can have a couple of them jump out early and at least face the 

338.21 339.47 A: [laughter] true 

339.06 345.97 B: you know [laughter] no [lipsmack] obviously that's not the way i operate but you know i understand where they're coming from 

346.02 346.70 A: yeah 

347.17 347.83 B: (( uh )) 

347.87 351.13 B: so obviously you're not in corporate america huh 

351.00 352.58 A: no i'm not 

352.00 354.45 B: yeah well stay out of it 

355.27 364.60 A: yeah no the closest i come to to corporate america is a few um odd jobs i've had uh like my share of department stores 

366.46 369.36 B: uh shoot what do you do what kinda work 

369.53 374.73 A: uh right now i'm a student and i work at a m- at barnes and noble 

374.43 376.14 B: oh what school 

376.65 378.84 A: uh i'm going to city college 

378.55 381.29 B: city city college where in uh 

381.44 382.67 A: (( mm in new york )) 

382.62 385.29 B: oh you're in w- oh i thought you were out in l._a. 

385.82 387.32 A: well i am right now 

387.08 388.20 B: oh okay 

388.50 390.16 A: (( but um and how about yourself )) 

390.22 395.87 B: (( oh [sigh] you know i'm work in film and tv [laughter] )) 

394.95 396.58 A: [laughter] 

395.67 409.16 B: you know i'm in a very very uh irreputable business i'm in a business where m- maneuvering the budget is is is the norm and and again you know what i different from the way i look at it 

409.29 412.93 B: if you didn't do it y- y- you ever listen to jim roam 

413.35 414.28 A: i'm sorry 

413.93 415.45 B: (( you ever heard of jim roam )) 

415.71 416.52 A: no 

416.40 418.33 B: oh you never listened to sports radio 

418.61 423.68 B: oh jim roam has this saying he's like if you're not cheating you're not trying 

424.00 434.61 B: you know and that really is the way a lot of businesses operate they're like if you're not trying to cheat you really you you're willing to lose you're willing to accept failure 

434.55 435.48 A: mhm 

435.02 440.72 B: you know if you're really trying to make it you're gonna do whatever you can to make it so 

441.06 442.91 B: from the t._v. you know you 

443.03 446.57 B: you're trying different things and again you know if you're an accountant 

446.61 449.81 B: the people look at the accountant and if 

450.20 463.82 B: if i'm speaking to an accountant and he didn't tell me something i could've done to manipulate it so that it's not that obvious you know so it's not obvious how much money i'm losing then i'm gonna think he's incompetent 

457.35 458.20 A: mhm 

463.60 464.74 A: mhm 

464.10 474.24 B: i wanna say you know w- what's the purpose of having you if you can't help me you know [laughter] you know unfortunately cheat the system 

474.85 476.56 A: [laughter] yeah but i 

475.37 476.11 B: so 

476.65 478.45 A: it's still cheating though 

478.72 480.60 B: right yeah but you know 

479.57 481.51 A: yeah i mean you know i'm 

481.36 491.64 B: if i was a not for profit organization and i need to make sure i'm losing money at the end of the year that's a great thing but you know uh most people for profit 

487.73 488.69 A: mhm 

491.62 493.98 B: you know for profit corporations 

493.81 508.11 B: and their goal is to make money and if your goal is to make money and you have the responsibility of let's say okay let's not say i'm i'm j- i just care about myself let's say i actually look and i've got two hundred 

508.15 513.68 B: yeah two hundred people that truly rely on me to feel their families 

513.69 523.60 B: now i don't know about the rest of america but i know about those two hundred people and they're relying on me to make decisions so that their livelihood is perpetuated 

523.94 531.68 B: i gotta make the decision to that uh will give us the best opportunity to perpetuate that you know 

531.47 546.06 B: and then perhaps somewhere down the line and again this is what most co- i think most companies are thinking somewhere down the line they're going to fix it they're not m- they're not planning on just kil- on just robbing the system their goal isn't to just rob the system 

539.31 540.13 A: mhm 

545.87 549.58 B: not everyone operates like michael milkin you know it's 

549.38 560.08 A: mhm i think a lot of the companies like enron their problem was that they were too short sighted they just did this as quick fixes instead of trying to do a long term solution 

559.58 567.51 B: you i that and i i think their their problem was is that [laughter] the practice that was 

567.47 575.87 B: that was bad they just perpetuated the bad practice so they weren't trying to actually improve they kept a bad practice 

575.78 589.30 B: going well beyond where it should have so they they they were they thought it was still losing money and just thought let's go to another country let's go to another venue let's just do whatever we need to do and let's just keep going 

575.87 577.00 A: (( mm )) 

589.27 590.15 A: mhm 

589.47 591.52 B: (( hey it worked here you know )) 

592.18 599.89 A: yeah i mean they could enron itself could have easily seen like you know it could have worked for a couple of years and they see it
