74.95 77.02 A: yeah well i mean i 

77.15 85.20 A: terribly upset but at the same time i'd like to see uh mainly people that are like enron and m. c. i. and you know adelphi and all those too

86.62 87.43 A: no 

87.61 89.53 A: [laughter] but uh 

88.92 92.18 B: think someone didn't like her brownies or something her brownie recipe 

90.63 96.40 A: exactly [laughter] oh i think it's i think it's just um i i don't think enough is being i mean 

96.50 103.16 A: you know if if you a few dick chaney's and i mean i just don't trust him i do- i mean i see he's in with with burton and 

101.61 109.49 B: well he- di- didn't he just give a reconstruction contract in iraq to a company he used to own or work for or something yeah 

106.89 108.48 A: (( did he i don't know i don't know )) 

108.61 115.87 A: i i haven't uh my cable's been out for a while so i'm just getting local news so [laughter] i don't know but i know that uh 

112.20 113.92 B: yeah 

116.34 126.92 A: i don't know i mean i i just i don't know how motivated they are they're they seem like they're still in bed with big business in general so i don't know how much they wanna really punish them or just give the impression that they're punishing them 

126.29 135.97 B: yeah see i mean right now ther- there's really no alternative for them but to be in bed with uh big business i mean campaigns are getting bigger and more expensive and they're lasting longer 

135.59 136.74 A: right 

135.93 145.81 B: so i mean unless unless they do something with campaign finance reform like making giving a large donation of of tax payer money to do it i think they're all still going to be in bed with the uh 

146.05 148.50 B: big business and tobacco and 

147.89 150.61 A: right [noise] exactly but 

149.20 151.86 B: it's all money 

150.70 158.81 A: but i mean you know the the economy i mean tax br- i don't know what you're view on the on these tax cuts are or not but i i mean 

157.81 163.42 B: in theory it should work but i don't know if three dollars a person is really gonna make a difference 

159.55 160.37 A: uh-huh 

163.08 166.11 A: right that that was coming out 

165.09 171.18 B: that's what their new uh their new uh dec- you're talking about income tax or eith- uh federal withholding 

171.10 174.53 A: um well i mean i'm not sure which one [laughter] i mean 

173.87 181.89 B: yeah the federal withholding that comes out of the paycheck every week that that was just cut and you save uh each person receives about saves about three bucks a week 

176.37 177.43 A: right 

181.32 182.25 A: right 

182.00 187.18 B: but uh with uh income tax cut i don't see any of it i'm still a student 

186.21 196.58 A: right right and so i mean it's it's i mean the the deficit is like what five hundred billion they're saying now p- projecting to be i think they spent more than they thought it was gonna be just a few months ago 

193.83 197.51 B: oh yeah yeah that- that's just crazy 

196.81 197.78 A: (( right you )) 

197.84 209.04 A: know you have an expensive war that's going on and and all this recession to begin with and then [noise] you know the public is used to be all that you know keeping the deficit low and paying down the deficit and fiscal responsibility and now 

199.64 200.43 B: (( mm )) 

206.42 208.18 B: mhm 

209.13 211.74 A: [laughter] it's like you know just spend and spend 

210.82 218.94 B: i i just can't believe we went from a one trillion dollar surplus to a five hundred billion dollar deficit like where where did that one and a half trillion dollars go 

218.48 222.64 A: well uh i don't know if you if you chat much if you're on the internet or not but 

222.40 223.78 A: i go um on 

223.62 227.43 A: all these chat rooms and there are these like this right wing chat room that i go into just 

227.11 227.99 B: really 

227.38 240.49 A: to i mean just to see what the lunatics are saying and they'll you know they'll say you know well it was never a surplus it was a projected surplus and there's a difference between that and and so we didn't lose the surplus you know it was just projected and the 

229.48 230.93 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

240.31 252.81 A: economy went bad so that that cut away most of the surplus and you know which to to a point is right i mean you know wa- wasn't all you know what clinton did it was the fact that the economy was just you know the tech boom and the 

247.48 249.21 B: mhm 

253.13 255.36 A: the stuff that was riding the global 

254.11 264.57 B: yeah clinton clinton pretty much lucked out on that i don't think anyone could have uh stopped this deficit it was just time we were peaking and everything falls 

256.31 257.45 A: (( that's right )) 

262.44 263.68 A: right 

264.42 276.54 A: oh and again you should should the iraq war was that necessary at this point and should we avoid it to get more ally support and more ally fina- you know money involved in it and you know it was another factor which 

275.72 284.07 B: i mean we're we're hearing about every other country having nucl- they think has nuclear weapons now and we pick the one that uh doesn't to go uh 

283.05 283.88 A: right 

284.05 285.13 A: exactly 

284.51 286.33 B: to go into and fight 

285.75 299.17 A: and you know and they say well now it's you know even if we don't find weapons of mass destruction we still got rid of you know someone who is uh all these human rights abuses and killing his people yes like but they don't c- i i you're never gonna convince me that bush cared 

297.57 307.14 B: i'd rather i'd rather give some money to the homeless guy i see every day on the corner than somebody half way round the world who i don't know and who my taxes don't go towards paying 

301.01 301.91 A: yeah 

304.37 305.57 A: exactly 

306.46 307.55 A: right 

307.36 322.01 A: i mean osama bin laden is still out there you know al qaeda's still alive and well and north korea's got nuclear weapons so let's go after the only country who's not currently threatening us and we can't prove it has weapons of mass destruction i mean if they did have 'em they're not able to reach us anyway with them 

317.75 319.41 B: right 

322.17 325.43 A: (( you know and north korea is able to you know to reach us to )) 

325.24 329.46 B: i j- i j- i just think they're trying to find distractions to take our mind off the economy 

329.05 330.52 A: exactly 

330.13 336.22 B: and the ridiculous unemployment rate which stopped me from getting a good job this summer [laughter] it's so hard now 

333.63 335.48 A: really [laughter] 

335.76 338.43 A: yeah what field are you in 

337.20 338.37 B: (( especially i- )) 

338.40 345.37 B: i'm a i'm actually i'm gonna go to law school in two years but uh right now i'm a polisci and history major and uh 

341.54 342.45 A: okay 

344.46 345.36 A: right 

345.57 350.24 B: just what can you do with that yeah i'm just buying my time 

347.40 348.65 A: right 

349.46 353.93 A: yeah you gotta get to you know til you get to this law school i guess and yeah 

352.83 356.30 B: yeah and what kinda internship am i going to do with history 

355.94 357.02 A: right 

356.54 357.36 B: (( really )) 

357.56 360.34 A: yeah i guess it doesn't doesn't give you many choices 

359.72 361.23 B: no not really 

360.67 362.97 A: yeah well i mean that's [laughter] 

362.16 366.66 B: and it's all because of those corporate scandals [laughter] 

364.34 367.48 A: yeah exactly we gotta tie it back in there right 

366.78 368.00 B: exactly 

367.57 373.40 A: [laughter] well i mean plus just the fact that the stock market i mean these people don't have confidence in 

373.30 385.43 A: in buying you know in in putting money in the stock market again when you know [laughter] is it really going towards that or is it going towards these you know there's the c._e._o.s uh palaces that they're living in some islands or whatever and yeah 

384.76 390.60 B: that's the whole thing it's all consumer confidence and it's at uh i think an all time low i mean 

387.23 388.12 A: right 

390.44 391.49 A: right 

390.91 393.29 B: no- nobody wants to take any risks anymore 

392.99 407.27 A: and the stock market has really always been like neurotic it's really just it's a you know people think something bad's gonna happen and then so they make it happen because they're you know they take their money out and it's like you're running the bike the old run on the bike kind of thing uh you know 

395.84 397.57 B: mhm 

403.11 404.05 B: right 

406.56 419.85 B: a- and how how could anyone have predicted like an enron collapsing and everyone losing all their money in all that stock a- and predicted that uh what what was the accounting firm's name i forget that that was forging all the books and everything 

413.01 413.95 A: right 

419.25 421.18 A: (( uh yeah what was that one )) 

421.26 422.63 B: uh whatever they were 

422.04 431.68 A: yeah yeah i mean it's it's i mean just enough to punish them i don't even know if they are punishing them but it's i mean [noise] they've made so much that it's not really punishing them 

422.71 424.36 B: but 

424.70 425.97 B: nobody wants to 

427.31 428.98 B: mhm 

431.49 442.19 A: and then it's more or less a giving the cop the um th- the consumers confidence that they're gonna perhap- you know prohibit it from happening in the future not just punish people for already having done it it's 

438.54 440.33 B: (( yeah a- and )) 

441.98 448.67 B: i just think the worst part about that is the whole retirement fund thing like ten thousand employees losing their uh all their retirement money 

448.07 449.37 A: right 

448.86 454.14 B: a- and anyone with a four one k. now in the stock market's going down i mean people are losing like fifteen a year 

453.96 457.07 A: right and then they w- weren't they publ- there was someone that they were 

457.39 458.87 A: (( like the )) 

460.14 472.05 A: within their company was saying dump the stock do whatever it's no good but then they were still p- publicly saying the stock is great keep buying it and everything so you know they all got out you know they all got out and the same thing with martha stewart although 

471.92 479.66 A: she claims it wasn't insider trading it was just she had her her computer program set to sell at a certain amount or whatever but i don't buy that 

476.98 480.98 B: mhm yeah a- a- and can you bel- i mean 

481.11 482.38 B: (( a- anyone )) 

482.55 486.46 B: reasonable if they get a little tip that says 

486.48 497.88 B: this is stock is gonna crash tomorrow who can honestly sit by and just watch all their money just go without at least taking a chance of getting it of doing something 

488.49 489.40 A: right 

493.24 494.15 A: right 

497.27 502.85 A: right i don't think she did it i mean th- that's sense i don't think yeah i mean if her stock broker 

500.16 501.84 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

502.67 513.81 A: i mean i i've been in stocks you know my stock broker may call me and say you know well i i've i've heard this stocks gonna start doing bad you might wanna sell you know if i sell that's not insider trading that's just my stock broker giving me advice 

511.71 512.49 B: (( no )) 

513.70 518.16 A: you know i don't know if my stock broker's as well placed as you know hers [laughter] was or whatever and 

517.47 520.60 B: yeah and the only difference between that is because there are 

520.88 522.82 B: the uh her 

522.85 528.76 B: stock broker guy or wh- what was it her c._e._o. was friends with her the stock broker or something 

526.82 528.99 A: right of and of um 

529.22 532.30 A: or whatever the name of the company was right 

530.21 531.95 B: yeah 

531.99 534.42 B: (( i don't even know were they pharmaceuticals )) 

533.93 538.52 A: they were trying to get something yeah in some way they were trying to get some drug approved 

538.17 551.08 B: oh yeah then and then it was for cancer and then they said i- the a._s._a. said it was terrible and it wasn't gonna work so their stock plummeted and then now they just said again that like oops it works 

548.74 550.18 A: it's good to buy again 

550.44 551.84 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

551.73 554.87 B: so it was all for nothing and 

554.21 565.22 A: right exactly uh i mean like i said it's hard to feel sorry for th- just you know it's if he you know i don't see them really prosecuting the other ones as well as much as they seem like they're going after her 

564.37 576.06 B: i mean co- compared to like the c._e._o.s wh- and and and the c._o._o.s who just completely screwed all the uh em- all their ten thousand employees over 

569.64 570.81 A: mhm 

575.43 576.43 A: right 

575.84 580.85 B: going after martha stewart who stole what two hundred and eighty thousand dollars worth of stock 

580.51 581.61 A: is that what it was 

581.22 589.98 B: yeah i think it was something like that i mean i- it's a lot but h- how do you compare that to like someone who completely sunk like a five billion dollar company no 

582.44 583.45 A: right 

589.18 599.89 A: right exactly i mean p- uh h- with the effect that it had on people it's not even close i mean people who lost all their four o. one k. and and everything and they weren't even allowed to sell it when they you know when they saw 

598.41 599.39 B: mhm
