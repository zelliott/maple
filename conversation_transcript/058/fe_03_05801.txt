87.84 95.10 B: uh they stay but some of them uh um leave but uh but with family it's uh 

95.61 98.00 B: it's something that's permanent 

99.88 105.10 A: would you consider um community being family too 

105.18 106.28 B: i'm sorry 

106.33 111.51 A: would you consider uh your community as being part of your family too 

111.56 112.16 A: [noise] 

112.43 117.72 B: in a way yes in a way i mean uh not on the terms that i described uh 

117.79 123.81 B: um a minute back but but yes in a way because um i think 

124.05 125.65 B: i think th- you know 

125.88 129.11 B: a person and the community is um 

130.72 132.09 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

133.69 136.73 B: [mn] w- we i mean we [mn] 

137.01 151.55 B: things people are inter- uh are dependent on on each other and and uh a person is dependent on the community and vice versa the community is dependent on each individual which forms the community 

151.70 155.01 B: so in that sense um uh 

155.50 157.06 B: you know um 

158.15 162.31 B: [lipsmack] the community does does uh 

163.05 166.96 B: um uh in a way uh 

167.40 168.49 B: (( uh )) 

168.93 175.64 B: come into the definition of the family but of course uh it is um 

175.91 181.80 B: um since since a community is a collective thing and not 

181.89 184.52 B: something very specific you know you can't 

184.10 185.75 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

184.71 187.39 B: it it's a whole so um 

188.08 188.73 A: (( [noise] )) 

188.21 191.32 B: um i- it's a different relationship of course 

193.43 194.26 A: (( huh )) 

197.67 198.94 B: um 

199.78 203.49 B: but i think think um 

204.08 209.66 B: you know you can you can view it as a family in the sense that there are responsibilities that one has 

209.73 219.16 B: towards a community and i and i think that the community has um for each individual living in in in the community too um 

219.43 220.95 B: you know um 

221.40 225.33 B: uh there's there's uh social practices uh 

225.35 228.30 B: um to be respected there is uh 

228.47 234.60 B: there is law and order to be respected and uh and at the same time there's uh individual um 

235.37 245.12 B: um rights and um to be respected by the community for the individual so you know i mean in that sense um there is a link a tie 

236.38 237.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

241.24 242.14 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

245.10 246.02 A: (( uh-huh ))

259.39 265.50 A: the one thing that i have a problem with especially with including 

265.51 268.04 A: (( the community i- you know )) 

267.43 268.17 B: (( [noise] )) 

268.17 274.87 A: as part of my family is that the children nowadays do not have respect 

276.08 280.08 B: uh can you can you speak louder you're not very clear i'm sorry 

279.98 281.52 A: oh i'm sorry [noise] 

281.57 283.26 A: i said um 

283.50 290.07 A: i agree with you on your definition of family as to as far community 

287.14 287.96 B: mhm 

290.16 291.21 A: i would 

292.03 294.37 A: more open with them if 

294.93 298.53 A: the children in the neighborhood had more respect 

298.69 300.38 B: right 

300.61 301.18 A: [noise] 

303.14 305.81 A: (( which they do not )) 

306.18 310.15 B: if if the people in the community show respect 

313.43 315.50 A: yeah l- like the kids 

315.54 317.21 B: right 

317.75 318.70 B: right 

317.81 322.67 A: they seem to use profanity they have no respect for their elders 

322.00 323.84 B: mhm 

326.07 328.00 B: right um 

327.89 329.42 A: uh they 

329.84 335.50 A: treat other people's property as a trash can or [noise] 

340.03 343.45 B: right right i mean um 

344.74 355.08 B: very honestly i i mean i i don't know how mu- how much of my details you have but i you know i live in a community where where there are children uh 

346.45 347.12 A: [noise] 

355.31 362.73 B: um you know who who probably don't have the best of education and and um and i think 

361.58 364.17 A: and they probably skip school [laughter] 

364.10 366.42 B: right skip school and you know 

366.35 367.69 A: (( and their parents are )) 

366.50 373.66 B: and probably trouble a few people around and you know the [mn] but but the thing is i mean you um 

369.17 370.46 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

373.87 376.48 B: one can understand um 

376.54 379.27 B: one can understand that as in 

379.56 383.94 B: um if they're harming somebody you know that's different but if if 

384.12 391.61 B: if if they are [mn] you know if the jokes or the fun is is amongst themselves then well that's you know that's their issue 

391.76 395.47 B: but but nonetheless i think um 

396.75 403.17 B: un- unless you personally harm the uh in the community that you're living in 

403.30 410.85 B: you know for example uh [mn] um couple of blocks around your place if if if it's not safe or if you know people are 

410.99 414.63 B: are really not nice you know i mean then 

414.58 428.42 B: then definitely um you will not you will not really like staying in that area of course because because you're scared because um people are not really nice or i mean they're they're actually um um 

428.49 432.72 B: uh let alone being nice they're not uh they're they're harmful

440.70 443.92 B: fear caused to the individual um 

444.53 453.84 B: i think pe- i think p- personally at least i i am i think i would be quite tolerant to you know 

453.99 468.38 B: i don't know the the things which don't which i w- which i would say is not really harming anyone um personally um i i but i can see of course if if 

460.95 462.16 A: (( that's correct uh-huh )) 

468.87 474.49 B: um if there's a lot of disturbance or if there's there's a lot of um um 

474.87 479.19 B: if i can use the word nonsense going on in the community then of course there is 

479.21 482.79 B: some sort of a distancing some sort of a 

482.86 486.33 B: um type of some sort of a um
