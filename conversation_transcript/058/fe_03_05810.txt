0.70 1.82 A: joey 

1.99 4.48 B: hi ah my name is ah jonathon 

6.65 8.28 A: jonathon nice to meet you 

8.14 12.32 B: yeah and nice to meet you too so ah i guess the topic is family 

12.32 14.87 A: yeah yeah what it means to us 

14.76 17.88 B: so ah let me ask what does ah family mean to you 

18.71 23.13 A: well ah i'd have to say it means a lot of things um 

23.76 30.12 A: family a lot of times i think about ah like depending dependence on each other you know 

29.38 31.19 B: mhm yeah ah 

30.23 31.05 A: like 

31.47 35.69 A: and and a lot of times you know as as time goes by like when you're 

35.71 42.12 A: when you're a baby you know you're dependent and ah when you get when you get a l- you know a little bit older then you're not anymore 

41.95 52.75 B: right but then you might become ah as as you get even older you might become dependent again like ah my ah wife's grandfather is kind of sick now and he's very dependent on her mom 

42.23 43.52 A: you're on your own 

43.78 44.76 A: yeah 

46.21 47.20 A: yeah 

47.45 48.52 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

52.80 65.19 B: you know who ah used to be dependent on him so yeah dependence is a good is a good way to think about it when i think of family i definitely think of um my mom and dad and brother and sister and you know extended family aunts and uncles 

52.90 54.04 A: yeah 

57.16 58.04 A: yeah 

60.57 61.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

63.87 64.74 A: yeah 

65.26 67.55 B: i kind of get a mental picture of ah 

67.65 71.42 B: you know like who i see like during thanksgiving and holidays and whatnot 

70.51 73.54 A: oh yeah yeah and ah 

73.88 75.55 A: (( i know a lot of times [cough] )) 

75.92 77.08 A: (( excuse me [cough] )) 

77.29 81.06 A: a lot of times sometimes when i'm when i think about family 

82.21 85.00 A: i think about how um like you 

85.35 88.25 A: not really not really dependence but like ah 

88.67 92.97 A: kind of more more like a psychological support you know 

93.07 98.35 A: of each other like you know your your like my brother's my best friend and i talk to him [noise] 

94.75 95.57 B: (( yeah ah )) 

95.83 96.57 B: i 

98.86 105.45 B: right i can understand that you um you know you kind of see family as ah people you can always lean on people that you 

105.97 112.02 B: you always sort of feel comfortable with or you know hopefully but you know i know i know sometimes that's not the case 'cause 

108.62 109.51 A: yeah 

111.81 112.75 A: yes 

112.23 118.10 B: you know there's a lot of people who don't like their families unfortunately but it sounds like we both do it's ah that's a good thing 

115.78 117.06 A: (( yeah true )) 

117.44 120.27 A: yeah there are parts of their family you know 'cause 

119.92 120.71 B: yeah 

120.82 121.78 A: they're like 

121.01 127.02 B: yeah and sometimes you might have a bad relationship with one ah family member but you know generally speaking 

124.83 127.73 A: yeah or like one side of the family 

127.59 129.16 B: right 

128.45 130.14 A: yeah 

129.87 133.53 B: so if it sounds difficult what do you think of um 

130.37 131.30 A: (( but you )) 

134.23 138.32 B: i mean ah like what are called non traditional families like ah 

138.43 139.80 B: (( say ah )) 

139.14 139.88 A: know 

140.58 147.50 B: you know a a a child who only has ah like a single parent moth- sin- like a single parent ah child 

145.45 147.54 A: ah yeah see that's 

147.63 159.62 A: that's probably you know you probably have a little bit of a different perspective on it 'cause if you're thinking about it you know like well well just what i was talking about before like dependence you know if you're two parents raising one kid 

159.66 163.63 A: and or you're one parent you know raising two kids by yourself or something it's 

161.97 166.63 B: right it's going to be a lot harder on the ah on the parent on the one parent in that case 

163.88 165.26 A: (( yeah 'cause )) 

165.27 174.72 A: that'll yeah yeah that'll probably like would be more you know that'd probably be higher up for them than like you know thinking about other things they'd probably say yeah dependence is 

174.58 183.49 A: you know a bigger part of it than somebody who you know or they have like a nanny or something you know so would they probably wouldn't consider that as much 

176.92 177.94 B: yeah 

180.52 187.21 B: yeah um yeah 'cause you don't it's not really like they're your family necessarily it's just somebody who sort of helps out 

185.95 186.87 A: yeah 

187.42 189.43 A: yeah definitely [mn] 

188.96 191.27 B: yeah but ah 

190.40 191.30 A: but ah 

191.31 193.16 B: well how many how big is your family 

193.39 198.99 A: oh ah well actually it's it's not really that big i don't i don't have a very big family at all but um 

199.34 203.76 A: like i i don't say i don't really talk to ah one side of my family 

203.61 204.53 B: oh okay 

204.46 205.77 A: yeah how about you 

205.90 209.63 B: um i got a brother and a sister and um 

209.50 221.65 B: i don't have a whole lot of aunts and uncles like ah i have one uncle on my dad's side and a couple on my my mom's side and you know we don't we don't see those ah uncles as much we see my my father's ah 

211.77 212.76 A: yeah 

222.28 229.32 B: brother a lot but my mom's brothers we see occasionally so i don't think of them or like the ah you know the people 

229.28 238.67 B: you know kind of in the immediate family as as close as like my my uncle and his wife and and daughter they're you know pretty close and we do stuff with them you know all the time and then 

237.34 238.40 A: (( oh yeah )) 

238.79 248.42 B: um my my you know i'm married so i definitely consider my wife's family as ah you know part of my extended family at this point and her 

247.58 249.83 A: yeah yeah that's good that you wouldn't 

248.51 253.70 B: her brother and my and i got a little ah nephew and you know 

250.17 250.96 A: (( yeah i )) 

252.90 258.62 A: didn't even think about that you know 'cause they could your family can like you know change it 

258.36 261.95 B: yes yeah i think of her her family as 

262.00 276.57 B: you know kind of part of my family at this point 'cause you know we do stuff you know my parents will visit and her parents will visit and we'll all do stuff together you know we haven't really gotten together for holidays yet but i'm sure you know if the situation presents itself we'll do stuff like that and you know to me it's 

270.22 270.95 A: yeah 

275.75 276.83 A: have they have 

276.66 277.93 B: a family type thing 

277.07 278.45 A: they met 

278.81 283.77 B: ah yeah yeah they they know each other you know fairly well at this point 

283.78 284.64 B: so 

284.92 286.45 A: ah yeah that's good yeah 

286.85 288.89 B: are you ah are you married 

286.88 287.76 A: so 

288.61 293.11 A: no i'm not married but ah i have um i i'm going to get married in a few months 

293.10 294.71 B: oh all right [laughter] 

293.95 296.48 A: yeah and i yeah and my ah 

296.68 308.30 A: my ah my family and my ah fiance's family are they're really they're really close it's funny because ah when we're we we were when we were younger ah we used to be friends and our 

308.42 312.51 A: our ah our both our moms were like best friends and you 

312.63 313.65 B: oh really 

312.64 319.52 A: know times so so it's kind of weird that i mean well it's not weird it's just you know kind of coincidental but ah 

319.62 320.52 A: it 

319.69 321.74 B: yeah how did how did you guys um 

321.87 325.42 B: ah h- how did you guys originally meet like in high school or something like that 

324.12 328.17 A: well oh no when we were younger since we were little kids we knew each other 

327.43 329.41 B: oh really oh and 

328.27 339.22 A: yeah and then just yeah we both we ah we both went away to different colleges and then you know we came back home and we just yeah i don't how long we've been seeing each other but ah 

329.48 330.72 B: that's pretty amazing 

339.39 347.10 A: it's you know that that works out really well because like you know i hear a lot of people saying they have problems with like their family and their you know 

343.08 344.08 B: yeah 'cause 

345.23 346.38 B: right 

346.39 354.47 B: yeah i'm i'm pretty lucky i really don't have that um but so i have a i have a i have a great mother in law father in law so 

349.10 349.97 A: yeah 

354.40 355.28 A: yeah 

354.54 355.67 B: i um 

355.77 362.70 B: you know i don't have those problems and it's really important i think because you know when you marry the girl you really kind of marry her family or at least 

362.01 363.06 A: oh yes 

362.90 373.52 B: that's how it seems so you know if you have a you know a wife and you like her family and vice versa i mean that's probably just going to help your ah your marriage in general so that's a good thing 

373.77 375.02 A: (( yeah yes it is )) 

374.01 382.80 B: and they they def- you're definitely taking them as your as your family over time i mean it's just one big ah one big group eventually you might be 

378.52 379.82 A: oh yeah 

382.17 390.67 A: yeah yeah see 'cause ah well and the good thing about it is i think you know like when a lot of times when you you know you first meet your ah 

390.87 393.39 A: your you know ah 

393.63 394.53 A: your 

394.71 403.04 A: ah mother in law and father in law you know you're nervous and stuff or you know yeah yeah and you're and you know and all and if they're 

399.10 399.94 B: yeah 

402.23 405.13 B: and you really you didn't really have any of that which is kind of cool 

404.32 408.26 A: yeah yeah i already had a great relationship with them you 

405.19 406.23 B: yeah the 

408.12 413.40 B: right right um so do you guys do you want to have kids start your own family 

408.71 409.46 A: (( know )) 

413.25 415.57 A: ah no not not now 

415.59 416.44 B: yeah 

415.71 420.33 A: but maybe maybe in a few maybe like five ten years thinking 

420.04 422.31 B: c- c- can i ask how old how old you are 

420.41 421.23 A: (( about it )) 

422.26 424.49 A: oh yeah i'm twenty three so no 

423.85 428.32 B: okay yeah i'm a little older i'm thirty but we're not ready for kids yet either so 

427.72 428.92 A: (( oh yeah )) 

428.38 430.11 B: like when maybe 

428.95 431.55 A: maybe i'll give myself fifteen years [laughter] 

430.75 441.07 B: [laughter] well no i was going to say we we want to have kids like in three years or so we want 'em like maybe when i'm thirty three so i think you're ah right on to wait like ten years 'cause you need time to ah 

434.91 435.78 A: yeah 

441.13 447.97 B: [mn] you know kind of do all the stuff you want to do before you have kids at least that's what kind of what i think so ah we didn't want to have kids ah 

443.63 444.94 A: (( yeah )) 

446.10 447.04 A: yeah 

448.04 450.02 B: like right after getting married so 

449.56 454.28 A: yeah 'cause you know you have like like once you have kids and you know for the next at 

454.41 456.42 A: least eighteen years you know you're 

455.76 464.17 B: oh yeah it's full time ah yeah i i've like recently had some friends who've had kids and i mean your life is just totally changed forever so 

457.67 458.57 A: yeah 

460.78 462.14 A: (( [mn] all right )) 

463.37 464.96 A: yeah 

464.51 467.67 B: um w- when are you getting married 

467.34 472.49 A: oh ah i we haven't set a date yet but we're going we're going to do it pretty soon 

469.91 470.79 B: uh-huh 

472.57 473.51 B: (( that's cool are )) 

473.06 474.39 A: (( depends so ))

475.74 476.91 A: (( ah yeah we )) 

477.27 481.37 A: well she has a lot more family than i do 

481.29 482.13 B: uh-huh 

481.53 492.38 A: that you know would be coming so yeah it's probably going to be like if it was it was just if her family was probably about the same size as mine it you know i mean we'd have like a nice wedding but it wouldn't it wouldn't be too many people but ah 

492.65 493.91 A: (( it )) 

494.16 501.45 A: but she's got probably i don't know she'd probably bring invite like seventy five people from her family or something and i 

499.71 500.34 B: (( ah )) 

500.42 505.71 B: yeah that's a fair size definitely have you know w- once you have like friends and everything and i mean 

502.59 503.48 A: so 

504.51 509.77 A: yeah oh yeah and plus um and ah ah yeah you know it's pretty much anyone you know we really know 

509.70 511.80 B: (( yeah ye- yeah 'cause it's getting )) 

510.25 511.90 A: (( so it is )) 

511.98 515.58 B: parties can grow pretty quickly and soon you've got like a hundred and fifty people there 

515.43 517.09 A: yeah at least 

516.45 519.63 B: but um that's cool where where are you going to go on your honeymoon 

519.89 521.82 A: oh we don't know not sure 

521.25 522.09 B: (( oh okay )) 

522.19 525.14 A: not sure we haven't really decided that yeah where'd you go 

522.30 523.89 B: we went to ah 

524.28 527.23 B: (( we went we went to greece and that was pretty fun )) 

526.27 527.35 A: oh 

527.41 530.85 A: yes how was it how long were you there for 

528.33 529.23 B: (( it was nice )) 

530.93 532.85 B: ah like ten days or something 

532.89 533.87 A: i see 

533.88 536.76 B: yeah it was it was good it was good i mean it was ah 

536.69 543.41 B: actually it's ah kind of ironic 'cause at that point it was nice to be away from our family 'cause you know after the wedding and everything it was just like 

540.98 541.96 A: oh yeah 

542.59 543.43 A: yeah 

543.34 546.33 B: a lot of stress and you know ev- everybody's around you 

546.27 559.74 B: [mn] for you know days and days and days and finally at the wedding and that it was so great to kind of get away so it's kind of interesting you know bringing it back to family there are definitely times when you know you want them around and then there's other times where you've like had enough and you just need a little space so 

546.68 547.71 A: yeah 

553.24 554.05 A: (( yeah )) 

559.34 561.36 A: oh yeah yeah of course 

560.51 563.69 B: but i think it's most important that they're they're there when you ah 

563.34 564.38 A: yeah 

564.01 565.49 B: when you need 'em type thing 

566.06 575.38 A: yeah and also like ah you know if but if you do have kids you could still go on vacation but really think about that you know like get away from them for like a weekend or something but that's still 

574.67 580.13 B: yeah like if you have um yeah you know that's another good thing i always consider my grandparents were a part of my family 

575.58 576.51 A: (( you know )) 

578.50 579.59 A: yeah but 

579.98 586.66 A: yeah but yeah 'cause you c- you could always have someone ah you know to leave your kids with ah it's not going to be some babysitter that they don't know 

584.43 593.50 B: right yeah we were really close to my grandparents growing up because they lived like you know a couple of blocks away so it was really ah yeah they were definitely part of 

587.93 589.04 A: yeah 

593.67 596.09 B: you know part of everybody who we considered 

596.10 599.89 B: you know our family so like and when they and when they um you know they
