0.84 1.96 A: (( hello um )) 

1.37 3.75 B: hello i'm jacob walburg 

3.78 5.54 A: i'm gabriel sing 

5.21 6.74 B: hi nice to meet you 

6.57 7.89 A: yeah you too 

7.30 9.65 B: [laughter] is this your first call 

9.36 11.20 A: uh no this is my second 

10.52 12.17 B: oh okay same here 

12.19 17.67 B: so the the the topic was i i couldn't really hear what what the voice was saying 

17.10 26.64 A: it is basically corporate scandal like how do you feel about corporate scandal you know do you think it's led to like a decline in the economy um what do you think the government can do about it no 

20.41 21.40 B: uh 

23.48 24.97 B: i see i 

26.12 28.94 B: okay okay you wanna go first or 

28.30 29.81 A: no you go ahead 

29.21 31.23 B: oh okay um 

31.33 37.74 B: well actually uh [laughter] i used to work for a company that uh 

37.59 46.59 B: sort of corporate scandals sort of you know it was it was a big deal because wh- basically what they did was that they both embezzled and invented 

46.65 49.29 B: false earnings similar to enron 

49.09 50.07 A: uh-huh 

49.68 59.94 B: and it ended with that basically the the this company that i used to work for got bought out by this this company and uh so they basically lost the whole business 

59.96 61.31 A: (( hm )) 

60.31 65.76 B: the whole technology so i'm i'm directly one of those that's actually directly affected by something like this 

65.61 69.19 A: and so y- you think it's it's real crappy that 

68.55 74.51 B: well you know i'm a foreigner and i come from i'm i'm originally from sweden and uh 

70.92 71.92 A: uh-huh 

74.69 77.84 B: you know where you have a completely different corporate culture 

78.00 82.11 B: first of all and you also have much 

82.57 89.90 B: you know more control not necessarily directly from the government but you have be- better sort of ethics 

89.88 90.69 A: (( mm )) 

90.27 95.73 B: than you do here for me i've been here for thirteen years but you know i run into a lot of sort of 

95.79 101.75 B: a lot of good companies but you know also a lot of the greed you know that that really kills a lot of things [noise] 

101.48 112.14 A: so do you think anything can be done about it given this this system and this society is is the culture or the are the cultural moors too different 

111.27 116.68 B: i think so because where i'm from there's a higher level of accountability 

116.63 117.30 A: (( uh )) 

116.73 120.10 B: not not just at the top but actually further down 

120.00 127.56 A: and you think that like here people would would say well my my my privacy is being invaded or or something like that 

126.82 137.54 B: well it's more like i mean just again based on my my perspective i mean what what you could do is i mean what i see here based on my experience is that 

131.24 132.12 A: uh-huh 

137.43 142.88 B: if something goes wrong you have heads rolling at the top or at the bottom 

142.99 145.78 B: but not in in the middle you know what i'm saying 

144.91 146.48 A: i see yeah mhm 

146.24 160.05 B: there's not sort of a direct hit and it's usually sort of the middle management middle [laughter] people that gets away with murder you know a lot of the time i mean that's that's or they're acting out orders from above so 

154.37 155.66 A: right 

156.31 157.27 A: right 

159.48 161.27 A: mhm 

160.37 166.24 B: i don't know i i what you could possibly do would i guess be 

166.71 172.53 B: [sigh] i mean from a from a from a legal standpoint i mean the laws are so different here too that 

172.73 174.76 B: where i'm from that i mean 

174.70 188.31 B: ba- but basically i mean the the accountability is is gonna be the big differentiator i think uh because all levels are are you know not equally accountable but they all are present when sort of 

188.57 190.75 B: it it's being called for 

190.76 204.85 A: mhm so so does that mean that if if something like this somehow happened in sweden that like it it wouldn't just be the people a- at the top ken lay or whatever going down it would be all along a- a- all along the chain of command and 

191.61 192.50 B: so 

199.58 200.38 B: no 

202.89 206.16 B: everybody everybody involved would be 

205.30 209.45 A: everybody would be like brought up for charges or something something like that 

207.75 217.47 B: yeah yeah and then you would investigate sort of each each piece each level each person um to see how much they actually had to do with it you know yep 

216.82 226.11 A: and and so so like if if i were involved in a company like that in sweden and and i i started to suspect that that something like that was going on 

225.46 226.51 B: (( mhm )) 

225.89 234.99 A: um i- it would be in my best interests to go immediately to to [noise] to the government if i felt like there was a cover up or something like that [noise] 

233.56 235.56 B: right right 

235.00 238.03 A: which which it doesn't seem to be the case here 

237.40 243.38 B: yeah i mean it it seems i don't know what your i mean why don't we talk talk about you for a few seconds too i mean 

242.79 255.62 A: well i don't i don't have any direct experience with anything like this so i i don't i don't really know except through what i've seen in media representation like i don't i don't know anyone personally who's directly affected by any of this kind of thing 

244.66 245.63 B: okay 

245.80 246.65 B: okay 

249.55 250.52 B: right 

252.15 253.20 B: yeah 

254.11 262.20 B: cause i i mean i have friends that used to you know they used to work for arthur anderson and you know [laughter] other types of accounting 

262.20 263.25 A: right 

262.24 269.33 B: uh firms that you know got into a lot of problems you know with enron and other companies that were never sort of highly publicized 

269.39 274.48 B: and it seems like where i'm from there there is actually a sort of a controlling 

274.66 283.60 B: uh monitoring if you will actually um organization that it's uh that is both within the government but also in uh tot- totally outside 

276.62 277.63 A: (( i uh-huh )) 

283.70 285.56 B: and they actually work together 

285.87 300.08 A: uh mhm and yeah i guess i guess i don't have any personal experience with anything on a large scale like this but i i know that um i i've been a part time contract laborer in a a couple of fields and um i i've 

287.22 288.18 B: to 

292.13 292.98 B: uh-huh 

296.65 297.52 B: yeah 

297.65 298.67 B: yeah 

300.13 313.48 A: consistently been asked to do things that were that that were quite clearly in in gray areas like um wh- well i- i'm just a contract laborer but like for example in one in one company i was being asked to 

305.58 306.86 B: right right 

313.33 327.65 A: um to buy and sell items that that were unrelated to the to the to the normal course of the business in order to inflate inflate earnings and and make it look like the company was was ha- was grossing more than it was 

316.32 317.24 B: uh-huh 

319.91 320.81 B: uh-huh 

321.06 321.94 B: uh-huh 

323.66 325.07 B: (( uh-huh )) 

327.08 327.92 B: (( oooh uh-huh )) 

327.51 329.47 A: and so so my job was 

329.53 339.70 A: entirely unrelated to the purported y- you know interest in the company and i was just to simulate ca- cash flow to make them to make them look good on paper 

332.89 334.49 B: right right 

339.07 340.24 B: right 

340.02 351.55 A: um and i- i- i mean if i had said if i had said no i i don't feel comfortable doing that like i just would have been out of a job like they just would have found someone else to do it and and so 

349.85 351.28 B: (( yeah right mhm yep [sigh] )) 

351.38 360.42 A: and so so you're saying like in sweden um instead of just doing that i would have you know maybe maybe gone to the police about about something like that [noise] 

359.83 368.12 B: yeah or at least to the organizations you know some- someone wo- would look deeper into it at least on a sort of an investigative level not i mean 

364.50 365.42 A: uh-huh 

366.95 367.77 A: right 

368.01 374.71 B: cause i mean in sweden you're actually innocent until proven guilty [laughter] you know actually innocent um 

371.46 372.46 A: right 

374.36 375.05 A: (( [laughter] )) 

374.52 383.36 B: but what s- so what would you i mean based on your experience what would you i mean being american i presume i mean you know what what would you do 

380.57 381.73 A: yeah 

383.49 385.10 B: you know in the situ- 

384.14 386.87 A: like how would i how would i change the system 

385.17 385.95 B: like 

386.35 395.03 B: no like i mean let's just take the situation that that you described what would you have liked to be able to do at th- at a point like that 

389.99 391.58 A: uh-huh wh- 

394.38 407.35 A: i guess i i li- uh i guess i feel like the little worker who i i guess that's that's what i'm calling myself the the person who doesn't have um the economic leverage to say well screw you i'm gonna do something else 

400.84 401.71 B: yeah 

404.99 405.98 B: (( right right )) 

407.15 420.01 A: that that person um do- doesn't have the power in in the united states to to do that like if i'm living paycheck to paycheck then i don't have all that i don't have all that much choice i don't i don't really i can't 

412.01 413.21 B: (( right mhm )) 

418.46 419.25 B: right 

420.32 426.01 A: l- m- my ethics aren't gonna fill my stomach um and and 

422.95 423.80 B: uh-huh 

424.90 438.75 B: do you feel do you feel that it's too big and too difficult to sort of initiate one of those if you had some i'm like i- i- if you saw something that was really really bad i mean let's just say ten times worse than what what you were you know exposed to 

438.18 441.54 A: like like like they were covering up murder or something like that 

440.39 443.04 B: something like that i mean that that's mhm mhm 

441.68 442.67 A: (( uh i )) 

442.61 456.51 A: i guess i guess like i feel like i i i know i know that i should go to the police but um but if i- i'm not if i'm not in that situation i guess i have a really hard time like i know that if i do that i i i'm out of a job 

454.31 455.16 B: (( mhm )) 

456.34 468.70 A: either you know it doesn't turn anything up and i'm out of a job because um because like my boss is like okay this guy can't be trusted or does turn something up and my my job is closed down and then i have to look for a new job and like if 

456.69 457.62 B: right 

466.26 467.10 B: right 

468.63 482.57 A: uh if if if i can't count on the government's support during that time in which i can't because i'm a contract laborer i i can't collect unemployment i can't i can't get anything um and i can't count on that i i might not be able to afford to do that y- 

471.79 472.61 B: right 

475.72 476.59 B: (( mhm right )) 

477.04 478.00 B: right 

481.93 495.14 B: right so it's basically a combination of i mean of obstacles from you know bureaucracy to to just circumstantial stuff and you know not really it's too i- yeah yeah 

492.67 496.70 A: no network of of support for for for me to be able to 

496.48 497.70 B: (( exactly mm mhm )) 

496.56 511.00 A: um to to to to make even the sm- smallest risk like that and i feel like maybe it's different for middle management maybe middle management can you know have some savings that they can live off of for a while while they look for another job maybe they're qualified to get another job but that's not true for everybody 

510.35 521.74 B: mhm do you think that with the current situation you know in washington and and sort of um in politics in general do you do you as an american see that there is a possibility for change 

521.59 524.19 A: no no not not in the least 

523.56 524.76 B: right 

524.52 533.00 A: i i think that most of most of america like the midwest all all all across the the you know everywhere from 

529.01 529.89 B: (( oh )) 

532.84 539.84 A: probably you know i don't know illinois on onto montana you know thirty thirty five of the fifty states 

534.85 535.67 B: (( mhm )) 

537.23 538.17 B: (( right mhm )) 

539.99 552.25 A: the- they're gonna m- they they got no conception of of this kind of thing and they're just gonna vote for whoever they're tricked into voting for i don't i don't think they have a real political consciousnesses at all 

543.52 544.66 B: yeah 

548.60 549.72 B: right 

551.58 565.29 B: right because i mean my my take on this is that it's got- actually gotten worse in some cases my last job i got laid off after eight years in in february and uh my last job they actually inflated their earnings by by cutting people's benefits 

559.56 560.54 A: uh-huh 

565.57 567.90 A: [laughter] yeah yeah 

566.69 570.35 B: and they got away with it and their stock price went up 

568.21 569.51 A: i 

569.93 577.58 A: know i i i don't i don't think that this is something that that the government has any any interest or power to address yeah 

570.70 571.84 B: you know what i'm saying 

573.05 574.07 B: [laughter] 

575.60 581.29 B: to me yeah but to me that's fraud i mean to me it is because you haven't actually earned that money 

578.10 579.08 A: yeah 

581.04 593.82 A: yeah i i i remember i i i worked in a place where um people had been working there ten years but they were all temporary workers so that they didn't have to have benefits so it sounds like similar to what you're talking about 

581.40 583.00 B: (( you know what i mean [laughter] )) 

586.93 587.78 B: yeah 

589.16 589.96 B: right 

590.48 591.34 B: right 

592.24 599.89 B: yeah no this is i mean we we we were four hundred people that that were bought out and they cut everybody's benefits you you only had 

599.00 599.89 A: (( hm ))
