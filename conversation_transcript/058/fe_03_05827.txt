64.78 65.91 A: (( [laughter] wh- )) 

70.71 78.85 B: is a- almost literally turning into a ghost town i used to i used to work on wall street up until about a month ago 

78.79 80.31 A: oh wow okay 

78.98 82.78 B: and um after september eleventh of course 

82.93 89.21 B: that was a major blow businesses moved out then with all the you know 

89.35 97.87 B: [mn] all the corporate scandals and stuff like that i mean i- it it the place is just getting hit so hard i mean there's just 

96.42 101.11 A: right i totally understand and i also i'm i'm a mess financially it's 

101.14 110.05 B: there's just so many businesses falling apart and i- i- i- it's just a shame because wall street just doesn't look the way i remembered it looking 

101.59 102.50 A: (( hard )) 

109.98 112.63 A: right it doesn't have the faith that it once had 

112.22 114.72 B: no no i mean pe- 

113.31 115.70 A: like it you know cause change 

116.56 118.10 A: (( like this they )) 

117.92 119.99 B: oh yeah sure 

120.23 129.33 B: and people are moving their businesses right out of the area nobo- nobody even wants to be in the area anymore i mean people are moving outside of new york [laughter] 

120.24 121.97 A: (( talk about and )) 

123.19 124.11 A: yep 

127.86 131.17 A: (( right i hear like imagine if that happened right )) 

130.78 132.52 B: yeah yeah 

131.54 136.06 A: yeah i with all their the you know moved operations up to jersey 

136.32 141.07 B: yeah and the new york area it's like now it's jersey it's it's uh connecticut 

141.22 151.85 B: uh people people are finding that you know for travel an hour or so you could still operate in the area without actually being in the middle of the area 

148.45 149.25 A: uh 

151.74 162.44 A: yeah heck you can do it in a you could operate out of you know a lot of people are operating in india and hong kong and a lot of outsourcing going on and and that's really i think that that's having a huge effect because 

152.26 152.97 B: (( you know )) 

156.62 158.89 B: yeah that's true too right 

162.44 170.36 A: they're just finding it cheaper to you know operate elsewhere so they slash a hundred thousand jobs now and then six months down the road you find out that they've 

170.52 173.82 A: on the side they're working on you know building a company and uh 

173.90 175.53 A: somewhere in rural india 

175.68 177.11 B: right 

175.84 183.41 A: where you know the wages are much cheaper than they are here so and you're getting the same if not better better work 

183.12 190.73 B: right th- that pr- that's probably why the unemployment rates [laughter] keep climbing up in new york and the whole country as a whole cause 

183.94 184.84 A: (( you know )) 

189.83 195.40 A: (( oh i know i'm familiar cause seven percent is really what is it six point nine percent )) 

195.03 197.96 B: yeah [sigh] oh it's it's it's just amazing 

196.14 199.45 A: yeah that's ridiculous i can't even believe 

198.01 199.24 B: you can't you cav- 

199.27 202.79 B: you can't find a job in new york anymore [laughter] 

202.19 208.48 A: i would imagine yeah why m- my buddies are living out there and apparently they're looking for jobs and it's just a pain 

208.33 213.30 B: they said the same thing in chicago like people are moving outside of the the main city itself 

213.73 218.47 A: but so what you know there's definitely some tension but not not so much people are moving i think 

218.65 230.74 A: like they're finding that the cost of you know picking up and moving operations is more is more expensive than it's worth but it's a funny thing you mentioned that because i actually work for the uh the chicago mercantile exchange 

230.13 231.47 B: oh okay 

231.10 245.51 A: yeah down here in the city and uh i worked for my division as uh we we trade foreign currency futures and they're talking about moving our operations to m- we have a remote site right now in case our building was ever attacked we have a remote site in london 

237.04 238.21 B: oh okay 

244.57 258.78 B: yeah see that's that that's the other big thing uh after september eleven george bush encouraged a lot of c._e._o.s and a lot of uh a lot of other upper management to move right well what i think it was something like two hundred mile radius or something 

247.71 248.36 A: y- 

258.63 262.82 A: yeah this is about this is about sixty miles or so maybe fifty mil- 

259.16 261.04 B: something to that effect so 

261.49 275.14 B: yeah som- something like that all of a sudden i hear reports that companies are moving their moving their management to like pittsburgh and cleveland [laughter] [laughter] it's like there's nobody there's nobody left in new york everybody's like outside of new york now 

269.51 271.17 A: right exactly 

275.00 287.88 A: yeah well they want take us to rural illinois and they they even and then they said first you know this is a this is a a remote site you know recovery of systems whatever you wanna call it and now they're saying well maybe we should just move 

284.71 286.14 B: right 

288.12 291.37 A: (( uh you know entire operations there and just work out of )) 

291.24 304.22 A: and so now that's the big thing is that they're trying to pass this thing where they're just gonna move everything there so uh it's pretty crazy the you know they just said rent's cheaper out there it's safer we don't have to worry about anything it's you know illinois's not gonna get attacked 

296.13 297.33 B: oh wow 

301.77 302.74 B: [mn] 

304.04 316.59 B: i i'm wondering do you have the same type of the security that i've seen in new york ar- around the stock exchange where you have the uh the cops with the the automatic [laughter] weapons lining up around the street [laughter] 

311.21 312.07 A: (( um )) 

315.73 320.06 A: i mean you know i was in new york right after september eleventh and i have to admit 

318.22 321.05 B: oh okay so you must have seen that yourself then 

320.71 328.39 A: yeah i was actually there in october and i have to admit that it was i wasn't even yeah i wasn't even a bit uneasy at like how much tension there was 

328.35 330.04 B: oh yeah it was 

328.93 334.23 A: and present and it felt like you know we were in a war zone or in the middle east somewhere 

332.88 343.89 B: yeah i- it's amazing cause i i worked across the street from the stock exchange for about a year i worked at the uh trump building which was right across the street from the stock exchange a- 

342.95 344.78 A: (( okay i know where you are )) 

343.91 354.81 B: and it was the creepiest thing every morning you see a- you see everyone lined up with the weapons and the the dogs and and the barricades and and then you find out when you get inside these buildings 

355.27 356.99 B: half the building's empty 

357.03 358.59 A: (( right yeah )) 

357.09 362.64 B: i mean go- going through empty spaces businesses just don't wanna be in the area any more 

362.10 371.33 A: right exactly yeah we have i mean you know there's definitely a security presence but it's nothing like in new york even at the mercantile exchange it's there's f._b._i. agents there and it's you know 

362.88 363.75 B: [mn] 

371.25 383.02 A: people with guns and you sometimes you'll see guys in army fatigues even just standing inside the building but nothing uh nothing too crazy i mean nothing where only some days you really feel like uh maybe i should of called in today 

375.93 377.87 B: right y- 

382.83 384.38 B: [laughter] 

383.98 392.32 A: but um yeah i definitely did i mean i was in awe after the thing total on the economy i mean for sure you know some of these jobs are being lost and they 

389.32 390.45 B: yeah it's it's 

392.24 399.50 A: just a lot of like foreign influence too in the fact that the dollar is getting so weak they're against other currencies and 

398.93 400.86 B: (( yeah )) 

399.67 401.96 A: a lot of these asian c- a lot of these uh 

402.10 406.32 A: asian countries are running a surplus right now because there- because they're they're fearing 

406.33 419.82 A: you know their own markets and sars and all this stuff so a lot of them are running surpluses whereas the united states is running a deficit and it's just making everything else making imports more expensive and we import you know way more than we export 

413.36 415.08 B: (( right yeah the )) 

419.43 430.67 B: econ- the economy's so unstable it's it's just e- everyone is just afraid and unfortunately and i i think everyone's still bracing themselves for the next terrorist attack 

430.53 432.24 A: right i actually you know 

430.92 432.07 B: [laughter] 

433.10 434.05 A: (( it's )) 

434.44 438.97 A: been quite some time now since september eleventh almost two years and 

435.08 437.25 B: it's a shame 

438.00 440.28 B: yeah yeah it's gonna be two years soon 

440.46 455.04 A: whoever whoever's behind these ridiculous attacks i feel that they're probably getting restless and all this stuff with the wars going on in iraq and afghanistan and north korea that i feel like these people are probably getting you know seeing all this stuff in the news and just getting upset 

455.47 457.51 B: oh boy i mean is there 

456.56 457.41 A: (( so )) 

457.52 466.86 B: gonna be any recovery in sight i mean uh they keep talking about a slow recovery and i i haven't seen any [laughter] evidence of that yet really 

465.82 474.88 A: well i know i totally agree i you know i don't know what they say i was just reading this other book today that they're saying the u._s. rec- recession ended in two thousand and one 

475.09 476.37 B: wow 

475.50 483.94 A: it says we've been like hovering between a recession and gro- you know actual growth which is like a really unstable position to be in 

484.08 485.11 B: oh boy 

485.10 487.70 A: so i mean you know w- we've been in this 

488.13 490.12 A: what happens basically where um 

490.26 492.76 A: japan has been for like the last twelve years 

493.07 496.59 A: not necessarily in a recession but they're not really growing anyway they're just 

495.74 498.20 B: (( [mn] right )) 

497.52 501.90 A: and not having any growth is just as bad as being in a recession you know 

502.26 503.49 B: (( that's amazing )) 

503.52 509.16 A: uh so it's i don't know i'm also worried i the only good thing coming out of these uh 

509.24 510.42 B: (( [laughter] )) 

509.35 510.68 A: interest rates 

511.01 515.04 A: (( interest rates are pretty damn low i just refinanced so i'm pretty happy with that )) 

513.75 516.49 B: r- oh yeah oh wow 

515.16 519.58 A: yeah so that makes me happy but uh now i'm thinking 

517.69 520.62 B: [laughter] yeah at least something good came out of this right 

520.48 525.80 A: right i actually refinanced like three months ago and now i'm thinking should i refinance again 

525.92 527.34 B: [laughter] 

528.04 529.72 B: take advantage eh 

530.24 531.50 B: sheesh 

531.67 532.72 B: oh boy 

553.93 554.84 B: neil 

578.81 579.86 B: (( hello [noise] ))
