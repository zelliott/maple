0.17 1.23 B: (( damien )) 

1.87 3.32 A: (( my name's fahad not )) 

3.26 4.87 B: hey how you doing 

4.75 6.01 A: bad how's it going 

5.83 9.56 B: all right all right you know honestly i feel that you know 

9.44 20.91 B: how today they need to like regulate corporate america you know the thought of y- that if you want a job and you can just get fired at where it's something that i really don't find you know to be too 

20.86 22.72 B: too stable you know 

22.58 31.32 B: you know i know the job is important you know people know how to treat the job important and i feel that you know people were not treating their job important then you know they need to be fired but 

31.18 40.15 B: people who that you know really out there and they're doing what they have to do for their job like okay take example in new york the horizon situation where those people all just just got laid off 

40.21 45.03 B: understand the name of a judge came back and told 'em that you know that horizon was wrong 

40.69 41.97 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

44.81 56.48 B: for doing that you know that things like that i- i- i- to me is unfair you know and basically you know corporate america is is it's is is wrong you know i i 

56.29 62.92 B: you know i don't know how much the government or how much the how much the government can actually have a hold on what they do but you know 

62.93 66.52 B: th- they need to do some kinda regulation in regard to fixing that 

66.96 67.88 B: (( you know )) 

67.35 81.27 A: well i yeah yeah what i think is that is a lot of these high level management people they get paid way too much and all the people at the bottom who are working harder a lot harder than those people don't get paid enough 

71.86 74.54 B: mm 

76.61 77.50 B: yeah 

79.36 82.59 B: um true i agree 

82.06 94.26 A: unlike ten people way up top that get paid each one a million dollars a year and you have all these other people they don't get paid nearly as much but they do twice as much work so there needs to be some kind of distribution 

91.40 92.87 B: (( yeah )) 

93.61 99.80 B: distribution right you know i'm not saying equal but there should be a distribution because you know c. e. o. c. e. o. you 

97.76 99.02 A: yeah 

99.66 112.18 B: just have to aim but yeah but you absolutely right you absolutely right cause basically if you think about it they're the backbone of everything but i think they have the feeling as though as if um you get fired we always have somebody to replace you 

100.20 101.86 A: yeah 

112.26 121.08 B: understand so they want and basically that's what it is you know if you decide well i'm not gonna put up for this and you quit they'll definitely find somebody to replace you 

112.44 113.51 A: yeah 

121.15 122.17 B: (( you know )) 

121.23 124.51 A: yeah these days it's so easy 

124.80 125.66 B: huh 

125.01 130.19 A: and i think these days it's really easy to find someone to replace because there's so many people without jobs right now 

127.98 129.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

129.38 132.71 B: [noise] yeah you know well you know [noise] 

131.19 133.23 A: this economy is pretty bad 

132.83 145.93 B: yeah it is pretty bad i think it does have a lot to do with corporate america cause it's always like see en- take enron for instance all these people doing these crocked things hiding things the n. t. a. with the transit fare and it's like no bod- 

139.96 140.63 A: mhm 

144.80 146.69 A: oh yeah 

145.92 158.77 B: yeah nobody's watching these people do it you know it's like and then it's like it's all right for them to to do it basically cause you know the the the fare didn't get rolled back so it must be all right for them to go ahead and do whatever they choose to do you know and 

157.58 159.67 A: yeah are you from are you from new york 

159.44 160.70 B: yes i'm from new york

162.86 165.51 B: yeah i i live in brooklyn you know 

164.79 168.04 A: i'm in manhattan and this fare hike is a 

165.89 166.79 B: (( [noise] )) 

168.66 170.72 A: beatch excuse my language 

169.12 170.34 B: yeah you know 

170.59 181.15 B: yeah it's all right but you know i i you know the m._t._a.'s a classic example of it how you know now m- you know uh it makes it look like it is okay for them to just do whatever they want to do 

179.94 181.86 A: cook the books yeah 

181.36 186.88 B: [noise] you know and that's that that that definitely right there is not what's really good you know 

186.94 187.98 A: yeah 

187.18 190.14 B: you know we'll mhm 

189.56 193.96 A: the government's on their side they just they turn down the appeal you know 

193.19 195.52 B: [noise] yeah when there's something cause 

195.59 204.55 B: because you know [noise] everything is we we're just trying to understand and it's like you know wh- who's there for the little people you know corporate america is definitely not there for the little people 

204.38 212.63 B: you know who's really there on our side that i feel like the court system all them all have a part to play in exactly what's going on and how it's going on 

212.67 214.72 B: you know and is it 

213.61 214.99 A: definitely 

214.84 226.43 B: well and that that's th- it's not right you know cause i like i said i you know definitely the definitely affected me that's a classic example of how you know corporate [noise] they just 

226.23 231.90 B: do what they you know they do whatever they wanna do and it's like you just gotta handle it you just gotta deal with it you 

232.14 241.50 B: know and that's [noise] you know it's unfair it's unfair to you know you stop calling us the little people you know [laughter] it's unfair to us you know 

239.19 242.68 A: yeah we need our rights too cause 

242.81 244.13 B: (( [noise] huh )) 

243.11 252.06 A: these guy- there's no one there's only a small group of these people controlling everything and they don't look out for the interest of the masses they only look after their own interest 

247.55 248.46 B: yeah 

251.71 253.79 B: yeah you know and yeah that 

252.76 254.45 A: (( there needs to be some )) 

255.56 256.56 A: uh 

255.91 256.54 B: (( uh )) 

256.57 257.61 B: i'm listening

258.41 259.27 B: hello 

262.46 267.11 B: yeah do you know like like like we i you know i i work in the private sector 

266.90 277.80 B: so you know we don't even have unions you know they can walk in any time and say well you know you're fired you know and then i- i- i- it's no it's not i- 

277.74 287.57 B: it makes you feel real unsteady you know and it's like you know who's on our side to protect us and then you got like the labor board i don't feel the labor board got any weight you 

280.25 281.66 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

287.67 290.96 B: know what can la- labor board really do you 

291.10 292.79 B: know they can't do any- 

291.58 292.73 A: not much 

292.96 303.17 B: yeah you know so you know y- kw- you know i- i- it it affects us it definitely affects us how they just do whatever they wanna do and we just accept it you know 

294.51 295.44 A: yeah 

303.51 305.92 A: (( yeah i understand i )) 

305.12 306.93 B: yeah you know

307.23 308.23 B: yeah 

307.27 314.66 A: yeah i wish we could do more i wish i could do more cause i was part of this i work in the health industry right 

314.37 315.37 B: yes 

314.68 323.32 A: and even the like it's so diplomatic and so buro- bureaucratic like it's impossible to just like h- 

320.37 321.50 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

323.34 327.15 A: focus on what you're doing because there's all these technicalities running around 

326.57 330.12 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah you know w- )) 

330.34 339.61 B: [cough] i feel you know i i feel at one point or another they're gonna start cracking down on on corporate america hopefully and then you know things probably will get better for for us you know 

339.72 343.79 A: hopefully these big busts at like enron and worldcom and all these 

340.03 340.92 B: but 

342.74 344.31 B: (( yeah worldcom )) 

343.97 345.46 A: hopefully 

345.73 351.16 A: it'll like do something hopefully people will see oh we can't get away with this kind of crap any more and 

350.74 352.78 B: right right 

351.39 358.05 A: then they'll you know get their stuff together but right now i don't know how well that's working 

354.86 355.82 B: yeah 

357.54 362.27 B: yeah i [laughter] it to me it it you know even though w- what ever whoa 

362.08 376.93 B: whatever's being done to them is being done it's just they don't care it's like you know you think if that one would set the example for the rest but you know i guess they make so much millions of dollars that a fine or anything in that regards is really i- i- it's a you know it really doesn't matter to them cause 

376.74 378.10 B: they'll make it back 

378.18 379.72 B: you know and that 

378.65 382.48 A: they'll make it back and they'll while they're in jail they'll keep it too [laughter] 

382.06 384.51 B: yeah you know yeah you know 

384.45 398.12 B: and corp- yeah corporate america i- you know it's it's amazing how they g- you know how they're able to do what they doing you know we just gotta we have to accept it you know and i don't think they'll ever i don't think there'll ever be so some extent i don't think there'll ever be any 

397.99 407.07 B: reconciliation for it you know they'll be able to do whatever they wanna do when they wanna do it how they wanna do it you know and it just us just to adjust to it you know 

399.32 399.88 A: (( [noise] )) 

406.25 415.67 A: yeah then we then people should start lobbying i think towards the government as much as they can try but because the only people that can regulate this is like the 

409.72 410.62 B: yeah 

415.55 416.61 B: yeah 

415.82 422.97 A: f. c. c. and you know those types of agencies that you have to regulate trade and commerce in this country because 

418.72 420.15 B: (( yeah )) 

422.58 425.22 B: (( yeah )) 

423.29 429.72 A: otherwise you know people it's a capitalist and capitalistic environment and no one's gonna be able to say what they want 

429.68 442.56 B: yeah you're right you're right you know i guess it's part of being a free state you know ability for them to do whatever to some extent they wanna do without any you know without anybody stopping them or you know controlling them you 

441.29 450.09 A: [noise] yeah you can do whatever you want in this country because of the freedom and a lot of times people misuse it 

442.67 443.68 B: know 

445.25 446.87 B: yeah you're right 

446.89 448.06 B: (( yeah ))

459.63 460.51 A: uh-huh 

461.75 463.12 A: that's so true 

462.84 464.43 B: yeah you know 

463.91 465.39 A: utterly true 

465.08 471.14 B: yeah you know i i guess i guess n- that's [noise] us that's the way of the world that's the american way you know 

471.36 486.28 B: definitely the american way you know it but it's sad too it's sad that we have to set for you know and these companies these companies and these c._e._o.s with these millions of dollars and you know we have to we have to be out here struggling or finding other means or ways you know to survive you 

473.75 475.08 A: yeah 

486.58 487.44 B: know 

487.61 489.56 B: it's hard you know 

487.61 489.34 A: [noise] [noise] yeah i agree 

489.66 496.50 B: we know life is hard and you know we try to do what each other doing you know [noise] it's like give us a opportunity you know 

496.51 498.08 B: to do what we have to do 

498.94 499.85 B: yeah 

499.08 502.02 A: yeah it's so hard to make the jump sometimes 

501.97 503.62 B: yeah you know 

503.01 506.39 A: really difficult to get up in there you just gotta like 

505.05 506.09 B: yeah 

506.60 519.50 A: some people can't do have all the potential you know the raw potential but they just can't make it connect getting even getting educated in this country is ridiculously hard it costs so much to go to college 

511.67 512.59 B: (( yeah )) 

515.17 516.55 B: (( that's r- yeah )) 

516.76 518.61 B: yeah and i say exactly 

519.19 526.99 B: yeah yeah exactly right cause they just raised tuition fees and stuff like that just just recently pataki and them you know 

522.90 523.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

526.13 527.45 A: (( yeah they )) 

526.86 535.68 B: and that's the and it's like one and it's all corporations all behind corporate america you know i feel that the whole world thing is all dealing with the corporate america 

535.86 544.66 A: have to make money off of people going to school like for me for example i have a one hundred thirty thousand dollar debt because of college 

538.34 539.33 B: right 

544.74 547.13 B: yeah are you doing how much what 

547.30 550.88 A: a hundred thirty thousand dollars of debt because i went to college 

550.52 552.38 B: (( went to college you know )) 

552.58 554.90 A: one hundred thirty thousand 

553.61 561.61 B: that's a lot of money you know you know cause the colleges are corporations too or their bottom line they they wanted their money as well you know 

560.98 564.43 A: money so they can get better and have a better rep and all that kinda stuff 

564.13 577.10 B: well yeah you know then they're not really worried about the students so much long as they're making their bottom line in profit cause they- you know basically the colleges they need money to run you know that's like i said to them a corporation they need they need money to run so 

576.73 580.77 A: yeah they have their presidents and c._e._o.s and board and all that kinda stuff 

577.11 578.00 B: (( basically )) 

580.03 581.22 B: yeah you know 

581.35 590.95 B: you know and that's and th- i guess that's basically what it is you know i i don't think corporate america will ever get any better you know i guess this is this is just how i live in in it must be you know 

590.90 596.85 B: because you know really even if government does give us the government must be in it for some kind of form of money 

597.00 597.99 B: (( you know )) 

598.37 599.38 B: and it's some 

598.43 599.89 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

599.54 599.95 B: (( some ))
