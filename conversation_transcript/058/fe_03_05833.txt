76.79 78.69 A: you know and the whole thing 

77.38 87.08 B: that's uh then that's pretty scary when you think of it isn't it that they it seems as though they uh absolutely had to know what they were doing the corporate heads had to know what they were doing 

87.38 88.99 B: and yet uh 

89.87 99.08 B: wh- e- i mean you you definitely knew that they i mean like the the guy with uh what was it the bernie whatever his name was with the [noise]

129.67 132.17 A: sure that's right 

131.54 133.95 B: oh so yeah 

133.16 139.79 A: but look what they've done to the like the people who work for enron you know they they've lost millions of dollars 

139.16 141.00 B: yeah 

139.95 148.41 A: you know in their retirement fund and all you know and that's just that's just inexcusable you know i mean uh 

148.61 160.50 A: i mean th- those those guys and they were taking millions from the company you know they sold out their own stock to you know and then bankrupt the company for themselves but there needs to be some uh 

158.75 161.53 B: and uh but 

160.69 164.25 A: some pretty heavy punishment put out i think but 

164.26 170.36 B: they haven't done anything yet uh i was oh i think they even s- said they just got their first indictment done that 

170.51 171.45 A: (( mhm )) 

171.17 173.16 B: on uh the enron guys 

173.25 177.07 A: yeah that's right that's right the initial 

175.56 185.52 B: it does seem to me like there's an awful lot of white collar crime is i mean it's even going way back you know back to the scandals of uh when they were doing the junk bonds 

186.09 190.35 B: that uh it pays to be you know it pays to do it big 

190.90 197.75 B: because uh what what the punishment is gonna be is a slap on the wrist in comparison what the take to what the take is 

198.23 199.81 B: what's the guy um 

200.14 209.93 B: the junk bond king what was his name he's he's out now and and working in the education field and you know having a good time

223.11 225.66 A: mhm mhm 

224.53 225.72 B: so 

226.30 234.17 A: i read about a bank robber one time up in uh well he was a cashier in the you know in a uh big bank in green bay wisconsin

247.60 260.63 A: he blamed some stockbrokers for taking the money and bad investments and all that stuff you know but they said they were the crooks he wasn't [laughter] that sounds pretty bad [laughter] doesn't it 

259.86 261.76 B: yeah 

261.15 265.63 A: you know somebody else stole the money from him you know is what happened but uh 

265.01 267.05 B: [laughter] gee [noise] 

266.01 268.96 A: but still [laughter] 

269.36 277.79 A: yeah i don't know but the but bu- but i take these things had a very definite effect on consumer confidence and a lot of other things 

269.47 270.38 B: (( well )) 

275.30 279.16 B: yep now do you follow it very closely or 

279.51 284.29 A: well i you know i try to keep up with it you know uh uh 

284.59 287.75 A: one thing i'm kinda curious about worldcom 

288.23 291.29 A: worldcom you know merged with m. c. i. 

291.29 292.13 B: yeah 

291.51 297.70 A: you know and this was done you know many years ago right probably ten you know eight ten years ago 

297.92 301.74 A: but you don't hear anything about m. c. i. being involved with worldcom 

302.13 305.18 A: even though worldcom was part of that corporation 

304.93 306.73 B: (( yeah really )) 

306.50 315.33 A: i mean i don't yeah i have matter of fact i was just reading an article the other day where worldcom's still part of uh m. c. i. 

306.79 307.62 B: (( i )) 

315.86 317.78 A: but uh but uh 

318.45 323.16 A: i don't know how uh m._c._i.s getting outta this yet [laughter] so 

323.50 325.53 A: but uh but anyway 

326.41 328.27 B: yeah well 

327.76 331.29 A: but i think there's gonna be a lot more of it 

328.97 330.11 B: (( i think of the )) 

331.41 344.96 B: i think it's what's hard about it is people you know like most of us we don't really pay atten- we think it's terrible and we think something should be done and then it's sort of like you go go on to more personal problems and more local problems and uh 

346.46 351.12 B: you know so the congress do- they're not not really all that much pressure on uh 

351.38 360.13 B: on congress to uh hurt these guys that uh [noise] give 'em such big uh payoffs and so 

359.21 361.01 A: [sigh] that's true 

360.21 363.75 B: sort of the they're going hand in hand it's kinda 

363.78 367.46 B: you know i don't know what it would take to really get a uh 

368.91 383.32 B: get a groundswell uh you know at kinda grassroots campaign to like get something done because i i think most people are you know uh as appalling as i think it is is to just say well go ahead i mean what can you do [noise] or 

385.64 387.84 A: it's yeah that's very true 

388.36 389.71 A: i mean there's 

388.38 394.85 B: you know and unless th- unless the votes aren't gonna come through i mean the guys these guys need the money to get the votes so 

393.92 394.90 A: uh-huh 

395.83 405.38 A: if they have well if they have a heavy investor from uh yeah that's uh backing their political career from worldcom you know 

396.07 396.85 B: (( so )) 

405.53 411.01 A: i mean why should they wanna w- wanna do something to hurt that fellow right 

408.53 409.84 B: right 

411.42 420.15 A: but uh in my eyes that would make them just as bad as the guy at worldcom [laughter] [laughter] you know but uh but uh but that's what happens 

415.96 417.12 B: [laughter] 

420.17 426.70 B: yeah but most the time you don't even know about it you know you don't know where their money's coming from and uh 

423.49 424.63 A: that's right 

426.96 431.49 B: you know the bills that they pass or this legislation that's happening everything is so 

432.04 434.11 B: convoluted that uh 

434.24 445.37 B: nobody could follow it you know or you don't the newspaper uh the news doesn't report it that well unless you go really if you like you really have to dig it doesn't it's not like 

445.44 452.98 B: put out in front of you because it's not that interesting you know it's not as it's not as good as the auto crash that happened down the block so uh 

453.86 460.33 B: uh i think that's it's yeah i i i don't think there's much hope that there's [noise] 

458.23 460.26 A: no i don't think so either 

460.69 467.65 A: i think uh with the se- i think it was the securities exchange commission did do one thing that i kinda liked 

467.56 476.36 A: uh they're having what the chief executive officer of all these corporations have to certify their financial statements now 

475.58 477.29 B: (( right so )) 

477.35 481.44 A: now that puts an that puts another light on things [laughter] y- 

477.50 478.57 B: that they 

480.48 487.64 B: [laughter] that at least to sign that they looked at it and it's true to their best of their knowledge and 

485.31 485.99 A: th- 

486.86 494.83 A: that's right i mean that's y- you know rather than just having the uh the the controller will do it you know and uh 

493.91 495.26 B: right 

494.96 508.04 A: you know whatever now the c- chief executive officer's got to k- got to be involved with it uh i think that's a that's one step in the right direction anyways [laughter] maybe small as it may be 

505.24 507.38 B: (( yeah although s- does )) 

508.13 521.71 B: does seem a little strange though i i always thought that's what these guys did you know is that that they sort of ran the company but uh but there sure was a lot of finger pointing once things started to fall apart no wasn't me it was him [noise] so 

521.46 522.72 A: that's right 

523.27 533.15 A: and these guys are making the big money but that's what i always thought they did too you know [laughter] kept their finger on the finances and all that and ran the company you know but 

527.34 528.39 B: [laughter] 

532.60 534.22 B: right 

533.59 545.28 A: but now i guess they gotta sign that they're that they're doing it [laughter] but still the money that these guys are getting are you know are way [mn] you know and i don't know way outta line too 

545.57 546.67 A: you know i 

547.52 554.87 A: some of 'em are just making too much i think so but anyways that's another subject i guess [laughter] 

553.41 556.51 B: [laughter] uh it'd be good if we could get it though uh i- 

555.63 562.05 A: yeah that's right that's right i guess i wouldn't complain then [laughter] 

562.13 570.15 B: i- it seems yeah it does seem sorta strange cause l- some of these guys are making a ton of money whether the company does good or the company does bad so 

570.65 577.47 B: wh- well i don't understand that the the whole idea of what their value is seems a little 

578.26 579.53 B: skewed 

579.55 587.62 A: i know yeah and some of them are uh you know the even though the companies are doing bad they're still doing good you know [laughter] 

586.63 589.06 B: (( right and so )) 

587.82 588.73 A: (( yeah )) 

589.73 597.20 B: yeah i i listen to the radio and uh on m. p. r. and they have some some pretty good programs and when i when i hear it 

596.58 597.21 A: (( y- )) 

597.68 599.89 B: [noise] i think you know the the common
