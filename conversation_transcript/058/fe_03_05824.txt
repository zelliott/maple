367.46 369.96 B: it seems that they in a way 

369.98 374.54 B: they were involved just trying to cover the other man uh

383.47 384.94 B: well i'm glad you do 

385.02 391.38 A: [laughter] the economy definitely has changed quite a bit since that event 

385.20 387.58 B: [laughter] 

391.63 393.74 A: and uh also with 

394.13 396.47 A: the accounting firm that 

396.95 405.16 A: uh lied on all their financial statements and they went under and it's just been 

405.44 408.43 A: i think a lot of people are very hesitant 

408.35 421.89 A: to have confidence in the u._s._a. right now not not that they're not confident in the u._s._a. but the economy is definitely struggling and they are not as confident as before 

421.79 432.18 B: [laughter] oh yes oh yes you know what i i really believe in a way i mean i'm looking forward to see maybe bush might strike again 

432.58 436.41 B: uh with the next full four years 

436.36 450.58 B: in the when the white house but at the same time i i really believe that the ec- ec- economy on u._s._a. i mean is going like i already mentioned a few times up and down 

451.04 459.61 B: and i really believe that they will definitely strike for four more years but i i don- i don- i don't really know 

459.41 473.69 B: i mean in a way i do in a way i truly believe that in my work in my not work cause i hear so many people complaining too cause they might blame mr bush no matter way 

474.28 488.64 B: but uh i guess as as a human being there could be times where you might look backwards and say hey you know what but this was the best most maybe some other people think no i don't think so but why not 

489.26 490.30 A: right 

489.47 499.66 B: really took place in seeing september it was pretty pretty rough especially in that area where we work it was very r- very very very 

503.47 505.59 B: (( tough )) 

504.87 508.37 A: yeah the economy has definitely been that going 

508.93 516.34 A: i i think it's been coming back a little bit um from the september eleventh it hasn't recovered or anything but i think 

516.83 518.78 A: a lot of 

519.73 524.73 A: [lipsmack] the surprise element that happened and the 

525.08 526.07 A: uh 

526.26 531.94 A: just the questioning of the future of america has been answered 

532.65 536.32 A: but it's still there's still a lot of companies that are not 

532.78 533.79 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

536.45 537.50 A: um 

539.54 548.20 A: they're still trying to make their companies look better so they there is definitely some fraud and uh definitely 

548.82 550.28 A: this affects 

551.21 559.72 A: just everyone in the world generally i think even when things happen in china or in africa and and 

557.00 558.81 B: (( [cough] yeah )) 

559.98 561.99 A: with their own government 

562.30 567.67 A: and fraud and different things like that it it has an effect on

574.77 582.32 A: employees they'd have to lay off because people aren't buying their services and it just has an over 

582.85 586.25 A: overall effect on on everybody i believe 

586.27 592.88 A: even when people don't even realize it has an effect on them i i believe it is affecting them to some degree
