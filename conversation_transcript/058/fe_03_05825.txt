0.00 1.83 B: hi my name is justin 

1.62 3.44 A: hey this is jimmie 

3.44 4.50 B: how's it going 

4.33 5.24 A: (( what's happening )) 

5.12 8.27 B: i'm from uh new york where where're you from 

6.65 7.47 A: okay 

7.70 8.91 A: (( i'm from chicago )) 

8.79 9.96 B: (( how's it going )) 

9.52 20.74 A: all right um sure what can uh can we just review real quick what exactly the issue was it was corporate it was whether or not corporate scandals would cause economic downturns 

10.06 11.95 B: you wanna start it off [noise] 

20.23 21.36 B: yeah 

20.72 24.61 A: uh it was also what was what was the sp- 

23.51 26.12 B: the world when the stock market i believe 

25.75 30.14 A: right is also should the government do anything about it okay 

28.15 29.42 B: uh yes 

30.46 31.49 A: um 

32.40 40.53 A: okay so what are my thoughts on it um all right um well obviously corporate scandal's been kind of a big deal recently um 

33.70 35.98 B: (( yeah only if you wanna start )) 

38.55 39.73 B: right 

40.59 43.07 A: i would not 

43.36 47.81 A: i would not [sigh] say that it caused um 

48.13 50.70 A: significant um 

50.54 63.74 A: significant effects on the stock market that were seen afterwards i would find that those events were mildly unrelated um obviously the stocks in the companies would plummet but these weren't necessarily the strongest comp- it wasn't like a microsoft plummeting 

56.74 57.95 B: (( yeah yeah mhm )) 

63.37 64.33 B: right 

64.93 66.14 A: um 

66.29 70.27 A: and then whether or not the government should do anything about it um 

70.63 76.16 A: i mean personally i don't think the government should do anything about it obviously i'm sure people feel quite differently on that uh 

76.26 80.55 A: but i feel like the government wouldn't have the slightest idea what to do 

80.70 95.23 A: and most of their time and energy would be wasted because they could try to curb it and in doing so uh the people these big these corporate scandals i mean there's there's always another avenue to exist under um 

90.97 93.17 B: (( mm yeah yeah mm )) 

95.51 100.80 A: i would i i mean i would argue if someone's gonna want if someone wants to do something like what enron did 

100.50 101.44 B: right 

100.85 104.78 A: i think that they're gonna be able to do it regardless of government intervention 

104.15 116.14 B: yeah exactly and just touching base on that that enron and even what arthur anderson did it's just unbelievable i mean a lot of these c._e._o.s i just don't think they have a lot of the time and they're 

116.16 121.68 B: they're just wasting it and i just i just think a lot of the time they're uh 

121.67 131.42 B: just messing around with the uh a lot of their employees and with the stock market you know it's a crab shoot so i i just i don't know 

131.27 134.34 A: how how do you think how do you think they're like messing up with the employees 

134.18 140.10 B: well i i don- i just think that you know they're telling 'em okay invest your money in here 

140.33 144.83 B: and you know maybe it- you'll get something out of it 

144.64 145.55 A: uh-huh 

145.07 157.88 B: you know i mean possibly you know we'll get a benefit out of this and i mean i think cause a buddy of mine worked for arthur anderson and that's what he told him he said you know put some of your money in here and you know it's definite gain you know we'll 

158.23 160.68 B: you know where there's there's no way we can lose on this 

160.65 168.52 A: well do w- a big part of what the issue was is that the cunning the cunning scandal that really existed was that they 

160.83 161.54 B: (( and )) 

168.81 173.59 A: what what what generally happens is that companies get in a lot of trouble if they overstate 

173.65 184.84 A: how much they expect to be earning an- and then they way under perform it because then they can't pay out their dividends cause the stock the investors are the first ones to suffer in that situation um so 

175.01 175.90 B: right 

177.73 178.49 B: mhm 

185.19 186.76 A: what happen that's 

186.82 189.42 A: so what happened was that enron lied 

189.46 203.77 A: and they said well we did perform uh and the problem was that they didn't have physical capital back that lined up with essentially so it was kinda stupid but what happened was that arthur anderson burned a lot of the files so that's why the accounting firm was busted for it 

192.41 193.58 B: right 

201.41 202.33 B: yeah 

202.36 204.50 B: yeah they sh- shredded all that stuff 

204.15 206.05 A: right 

204.60 206.99 B: and everything so what do you do for a living

249.67 251.69 B: (( [laughter] yeah i know exactly man )) 

251.84 257.97 B: but um yeah i don't know what else i mean how else do you feel about this stuff with like the stock market i mean

263.06 268.86 B: yeah i know i mean not money i mean like are are you having trouble find- like do you have a job this summer 

268.56 271.76 A: uh yeah yeah i'm working at a hospital for the summer 

271.20 274.72 B: that's cool yeah i mean i have like oh an internship but 

274.31 281.54 A: yeah it doesn't really m- a lot of my friends who have like political internships and such a think like i have a friend who's like not getting paid for it but she's 

280.45 283.55 B: yeah that's the same same thing with me yeah 

282.00 287.81 A: really so i mean that's the thing now is a lot of people cause they didn't really wanna pay interns cause they don't have to so 

286.29 289.33 B: yeah exactly i mean it's just experience 

289.16 291.10 A: right 

289.61 293.21 B: but i mean you you invest in the stock market 

292.75 298.44 A: uh yeah minimally yeah yeah like i'm in i'm 

293.47 294.98 B: just like mildly 

295.03 296.38 B: (( minimally okay )) 

297.00 300.44 B: like what are you what are you looking to uh what do you look to invest in 

300.75 311.27 A: um well to be honest uh i i recently like joined it's like this club there's like twenty five partners in this like club at school um [lipsmack] it's kinda like a st- it's like a stock market thing where 

308.19 309.36 B: right 

311.22 322.44 A: everyone buys the- there's a fund it's called collectively it's a fund the twenty five people own the fund um so like when the seniors graduated they found like new sophomores to kinda replace those guys 

315.36 316.29 B: right 

316.99 317.80 B: uh-huh 

321.51 322.92 B: oh gosh 

322.22 323.46 A: what happened was we like 

323.42 335.26 A: bought their one share of the fund from them um so then we used collectively the money in the fund to invest in four or five i mean we can afford four or five different stocks cause you you don't wanna buy like two shares 

325.64 326.46 B: uh-huh 

334.49 340.24 B: right yeah cause you're yeah mm 

335.24 339.27 A: of like eighty stocks cause like you have to pay every time you go through a broker 

339.14 345.03 A: so we generally run about four or five stocks and like maybe about sixty so we have about six hundred dollars invested in like each stock 

344.87 358.18 A: so at least it means something i guess on our end um but usually like we'll like we'll meet once a week and like usually when stocks get presented um like one guy's been watching it for a couple of weeks um 

347.09 349.07 B: right well that's interesting 

351.85 354.13 B: (( mm )) 

354.32 355.05 B: right 

357.28 358.59 B: (( right mhm )) 

358.01 361.44 A: and i think people try to choose 

361.81 373.17 A: [lipsmack] either more seasonal ones like harley davidson over the summer uh circuit city around christmas time uh or like you know when there's press releases about how 

373.28 384.24 A: you know flat you know flat screen t._v.s and that sort of thing like all of a sudden th- they like found some new technologies they can chop the price in half you know like they're like they try to jump on like a best buy like a circuit city that kind of company 

375.63 376.60 B: right 

383.53 385.71 B: yeah wow they were right on the ball with that 

385.16 398.56 A: right and then uh let me think what else i'm trying to think what else they might oh and then and then obviously the odd technology stock which you can make a shit load of money on but it can just as likely cause i mean this isn't 

385.78 386.69 B: (( it's great )) 

395.59 396.53 B: right 

398.40 412.15 A: it's not that much money that we're pushing round it's like like no one everyone's willing to at least lose the amount they've invested in so if like one of the five companies is kind of like a risky and like you know asian computer company or something like that like that's just on the off chance that you know 

403.66 404.54 B: uh-huh 

412.11 414.13 A: it'll turn into something i guess 

413.46 415.52 B: (( that's incredible [laughter] )) 

415.62 417.46 B: that's a good club you got [laughter] there man 

417.35 421.49 A: yeah well i mean hopefully it'll help me when i use a lot of my own money 

419.85 423.53 B: i mean that'll look great on your resume [laughter] too man that you had something like that man i 

422.95 424.98 A: yeah hopefully [laughter] 

423.90 426.00 B: mean i i don't see why not man 

425.77 427.30 A: hopefully [laughter] 

426.38 427.93 B: that's great so y- you 

427.95 429.84 B: enjoy it over there at harvard huh 

429.45 433.03 A: yeah i like it i mean yeah it's okay [laughter] 

432.70 434.02 B: that's great you would like 

433.13 435.28 A: it's fun boston's awesome so 

434.82 436.96 B: yeah i mean do you live in boston or 

436.81 439.87 A: um well i'm from chicago originally so 

438.38 441.37 B: oh wow so there you go that's a home away from home there man 

440.57 448.35 A: yeah right exactly and everyone there is from other places you just as i it was nice that not everyone just went in knowing each other you know so 

441.47 442.14 B: (( so )) 

443.75 444.94 B: yeah of course 

447.25 449.84 B: right yeah that's that's an experience man 

449.56 451.15 A: yeah 

450.36 451.42 B: that's cool 

452.44 455.58 B: man just trying to think if there's anything else to touch base on this 

455.52 458.77 A: yeah well a- apparently have you done one this is the first uh 

457.83 460.94 B: no this is the first one for me man i got i went in here cold man h- 

460.70 462.27 A: really yeah me too

465.47 466.30 B: right 

467.33 469.08 B: yeah that's what happened before 

467.95 478.95 A: which doesn't make any sense because that means that they initiated the call and then hung up which doesn't make shit for sense like if like if you called me and i hung up okay that makes sense but i was receiving the call so 

471.63 473.30 B: hung up yeah exactly

502.62 506.08 B: no i think they'll pay you for it i don't see why not
