77.15 77.97 A: (( right )) 

79.21 89.45 B: [lipsmack] are they part of the recession i would have to say no to that i i think more the recession was just how badly how many businesses were hurt during september eleventh

375.90 377.79 B: mhm 

377.20 379.48 A: [mn] it's a different experience 

379.48 382.02 B: yeah ah that sounds interesting 

381.58 384.07 A: [lipsmack] so is this your third phone call with these people

390.71 401.25 B: ah so i did my three but my i live with my brother and ah he signed up [laughter] too so he wasn't here when the phone call so i figured whatever i'll just do it for him it takes you know ten minutes 

393.93 395.04 A: (( right [noise] )) 

399.18 400.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] when )) 

401.52 406.96 B: you know i i'll just get him to you know ah maybe i'll give me half [laughter] 

406.35 407.98 A: does th- when does the money come in 

408.12 411.42 B: i don't know 'cause i just finished by third one on monday 

411.24 412.10 A: okay 

411.80 419.31 B: [mn] so i was actually maybe sometime later today i'll go check the website and 'cause on the website i think you could check the status 

418.04 420.83 A: (( mm )) 

419.58 421.76 B: of your ah of your check 

421.38 423.07 A: and you can do it just one time right

424.50 427.05 A: that's it one time that's thirty bucks 

426.03 434.12 B: yeah i think yeah th- you might be able to do it more than that but then you have to call from different phones like every three times you do it i think you have to do it from a different phone 

434.10 436.00 A: oh that's the only requirement yeah 

435.56 438.72 B: i i i believe so but i'm not sure ah

443.74 445.09 B: you know maybe just 

444.36 452.88 A: actually i'm on my cell phone now 'cause when i when i put yes for cell phone on monday nobody wanted to talk to a cell phone i guess so it wouldn't work so i told them it was my home phone

542.07 542.96 A: (( you know )) 

543.19 544.08 B: okay

548.48 549.25 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

548.61 549.42 B: (( [mn] yea- )) 

549.80 552.62 B: just because ah this is such a bad topic

559.07 559.63 A: (( [mn] )) 

559.28 565.50 B: no i don't think it's more than ten minutes but i'm just saying i think it's just because it feels more than ten minutes 'cause it's such a horrible topic 

565.44 566.67 A: oh i see 

566.40 571.34 B: yeah 'cause u- usually at ten minutes they they pretty much cut you off they- they'll let you know 

569.81 570.66 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

571.41 574.24 B: at this point we're almost like just waiting [laughter]

589.05 590.39 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

589.66 594.11 B: i don't know how well they listen to 'em but yeah i wou- i would have to say yeah 

593.58 595.10 A: i think they would 

594.38 599.96 B: they probably do and th- you know maybe there's someone who'll just listen to 'em and then for certain things they ah
