0.00 0.80 A: hello 

0.20 3.01 B: h- hello good evening how're you doing 

2.44 3.87 A: (( good yourself )) 

3.29 5.93 B: uh doing fine my name is patrick 

5.70 8.63 A: and my name is colin and i'm in boston 

8.37 11.57 B: hi colin and i'm patrick and i'm in chicago 

11.79 15.75 B: um i'm gonna let you start it off colin what you think about it 

15.65 16.95 A: (( em )) 

17.18 28.19 A: i think it's i think it needs to be tougher em sentences handed down to the people that em that commit w- corporate trends i think them a lot of them get away too easy 

28.03 29.23 B: (( um )) 

28.32 29.89 A: (( with the crimes they commit )) 

29.91 44.59 B: right i i i really agree i give you a prime example the enron scandal i think this is one of the biggest scandals in the history of o- o- of uh maybe one of the biggest h- uh scandals ever 

35.38 36.27 A: yeah 

44.38 45.37 A: yeah 

44.73 51.01 B: and they got away with it scot free but w- my my point is on this 

46.11 46.93 A: yeah 

51.94 62.52 B: one of the main culprits reason why corporate uh america can get away with some of the things is because the government practices that's going on in government i mean you got 

62.36 75.43 B: who funnel money to senators and congressmen behind closed doors then you have uh for instance this p- current administration uh they had interest in enron 

75.01 76.08 A: yeah 

75.54 81.02 B: i mean the president of the united states himself and the vice president they knew 

81.28 86.93 B: i mean this is i i mean i i'm very appalled about it 

84.29 85.10 A: (( u- u- )) 

85.89 88.51 A: yeah that's how they made their money was through em 

89.24 94.76 A: and that's what the the main problem is is the people that are committing these crimes 

94.80 101.00 A: all the people who's what backing senators and presidents they're the one that's giving them all their the fund money 

100.98 111.63 B: right right and i you know and i w- and i think corporate america with greed that that takes place uh in our society today 

111.29 112.14 A: yeah 

111.42 125.20 B: they could be a little more uh forth giving i- uh in their in what they give back to the community for instance america america's supposed to be the richest country in the world we live in a capitalistic society 

118.18 119.00 A: yeah 

125.23 129.64 B: and yet we have homeless people 

129.27 130.21 A: (( yeah )) 

129.58 131.67 B: we have people who are 

131.55 142.77 B: uh hungry i mean we have the economically disenfranchised i cannot believe that minimum wage in this country is still five dollars and some odd cents in iowa 

141.96 143.27 A: yeah yeah 

142.63 146.65 B: i mean that's even the garbage man should be making at least ten dollars an hour 

146.27 147.41 A: yep 

147.09 155.71 B: i mean come on uh i mean all the money is going straight to the top and is not being correctly distributed to other people 

155.49 156.92 A: yeah see w- 

156.99 161.25 A: one of the things that really annoys me about what the whole corporate claim thing 

161.20 173.34 A: is like when when they're committing these crimes they're making millions and and billions of dollars and then when they when they get found out and the vast majority of the cases they get to keep the money that they swindled 

172.83 175.11 B: (( right )) 

173.21 179.06 A: and then the tax payers have gotta pay for for when they sue what the government have spent like 

178.42 184.69 B: right like the taxpayers down in texas with enron and across the board uh 

180.89 182.03 A: yeah 

183.05 190.41 A: yep they they're getting like they're getting handed the bill and then let people like kenneth lay and and that they're 

190.44 194.91 A: (( there they're the ones that are walking away with a little slap on the wrist and then they can go )) 

194.81 195.91 B: colin 

195.09 196.44 A: head off to the sun 

196.09 204.13 B: i i i colin i i detect a bit of an accent a- accent from you are you originally from here or d- or where are you from 

200.76 201.66 A: yeah 

202.79 207.17 A: i'm from sc- i'm from scotland yeah just move here a half year ago 

204.62 208.49 B: scotland do you have that problem in scotland 

208.02 213.86 A: em corporate claim's not like a huge problem back home em i think it's because most of the the 

213.11 219.83 B: you see i i think it's it's definitely a problem here because we influence people ac- across the uh across the world 

219.60 220.68 A: yeah 

219.93 232.41 B: and my main issue on this is [lipsmack] i mean you got also got situations coming up where uh different factories corporations um [lipsmack] 

232.20 244.35 B: they get pay a lot of money to for congressmen and senators to look the other way uh same thing with the oil industry uh you you got uh the r- 

244.44 248.40 B: you got the environment that's that's being affected by 

248.25 260.21 B: people turning their back to what needs to be done because they're trying to save money and and then you got for instance you got old tobacco industry who uh 

252.73 253.61 A: yeah 

260.10 269.98 B: you know i hope i'm not offending you if you're a smoker but i mean tobacco industry i mean it's is is proven time and time again that 

262.67 264.02 A: no i'm not a smoker 

269.87 279.38 B: tobacco causes cancer yeah it took that long it's taken that long and i really still don't see uh uh a whole 

271.95 272.76 A: yeah 

279.85 284.89 B: lot of uh things y- other than maybe commercials on t._v. 

285.13 288.97 B: to uh even uh remotely say that hey 

289.25 298.46 B: [mn] you know people are trying to get the message out there to stop these people you know they're just making money uh [sigh] it's a money machine i tell you 

292.86 293.73 A: yeah 

294.21 295.42 A: (( yeah )) 

298.35 311.32 A: yeah that's where the whole boi- people that once they once they get to the top they just become too greedy and that's the they forget about like the lives that that they affect and they just want to earn their next dollar 

311.49 325.06 B: see we also have the same problem colin with the uh with the insurance industry insurance really run this country i mean i mean when the clinton administration talked about on the platform of the a healthcare reform 

318.62 319.41 A: yeah 

324.92 336.93 B: i thought that was one of the biggest potential great uh things that anybody could ever do in politics to bring that done bring that no sooner he sh- put that through congress 

336.82 345.71 B: they shot it down like it was nothing and and isn't it a shame that people can't don't even have health coverage 

337.64 338.51 A: yeah 

339.48 340.67 A: yeah 

345.56 357.60 A: yeah i that's one of the major shocks i have from from back home we have em a nationalized health service so everybody in the country gets em automatic health coverage 

345.82 346.85 B: i mean 

356.82 369.94 B: exactly exactly and now with corporate america now they telling people in their four o. one case their investment plans are no good they're not even backing them now i mean i- i mean what what what i- what's up with 

364.88 365.66 A: yeah 

369.93 371.60 A: yeah 

371.69 377.16 A: it's i i think it's scandalous to be able to pe- some people get treated they get 

376.23 385.17 B: that right but but see i think one of the biggest reasons why things are not going to change and th- and they're really pessimistic about the future 

385.01 396.13 B: is because people like you and me okay we talk about it but then again we don't do en- people in general don't do enough when you've got a country that votes 

393.10 393.96 A: yeah 

396.07 407.50 B: like we do in elections specially none presidential elections like congressional elections and all major all for years they don't even vote we- 

405.57 406.44 A: yeah 

406.79 408.24 A: (( yeah i )) 

408.39 410.34 B: we we don't vote 

409.84 412.41 A: (( think a l- a lot of people feel that w- )) 

412.68 424.13 A: it's just the same people you're putting into into power one way or the other i think that's why a lot of people have become disillusioned just one corrupt person versus another corrupt person 

420.29 421.20 B: right 

423.94 425.27 B: right 

424.68 433.79 A: (( and like what you said about em the clinton health reform em to me it seems like one's like important em w- bills and them get to it )) 

433.95 436.14 A: get to what the senate and the congress 

435.83 437.74 B: (( mhm )) 

436.26 444.44 A: em it all comes down to you know politics democrats versus republicans if it's a democrat that backed plan then it's not gonna get there 

440.37 442.19 B: (( right )) 

444.40 445.76 B: (( right )) 

444.75 449.41 A: support it needs from republicans is not people with enough bravery 

449.10 450.74 B: right 

449.46 453.26 A: to to do what they think is right rather than what their party wants them to do 

452.69 463.51 B: a- a- and see basically what you have colin is you have deals being p- made by for instance i i'm not afraid to tell you my my political affiliation i am a p- predominantly a democrat 

463.16 464.41 A: (( yeah same here )) 

463.36 469.67 B: not that i would- would- but i do look at each issue as what it is but 

469.72 478.39 B: they might make a deal some guy might make a deal to make a deal for his state or make a deal for his committee in order to 

476.72 477.51 A: yeah 

478.93 488.48 B: y- i mean you can't trust none of 'em because they're making deals you know they make deals with each other to okay if you vote on this 

488.06 490.90 A: yeah if you scratch my back i'll scratch your back 

488.63 489.68 B: i'll 

490.42 495.25 B: scratch your back when they just should be doing doing doing the right thing 

494.26 496.36 A: yeah yeah exactly 

495.81 506.83 B: right so uh now i i'm really pessimistic about it but at the same time you know one day if people just come together on a lot of issues a lot of things could could be done 

506.65 508.26 A: (( yep )) 

507.23 520.39 B: but um [lipsmack] you know i i i i i feel that it's a tragedy it really is uh the way corporate america is really inflated and it's really happened the last hundred years you know right after the industrial revolution 

517.85 518.64 A: yeah 

520.47 531.91 B: i mean things have skyro- skyrocketed and then what about the newest thing uh companies taking over corporate taking over other corporations o- business that you got it's a volatile world 

531.34 532.15 A: (( yep )) 

532.24 536.52 B: i mean you got the uh nike people taking over converse 

536.17 537.58 A: yeah yeah 

536.94 538.39 B: you know uh 

539.02 542.04 B: [mn] such things as that you know 

541.01 543.71 A: (( i think you just got to watch out that )) 

543.97 555.96 A: that em i- i- it's good 'til you let let companies go out and let let em i can't the fittest will survive but but also you've got to watch out that one company doesn't get too much 

545.30 546.67 B: right 

551.39 552.38 B: right 

553.95 554.73 B: now 

555.38 563.02 B: right now i'm not trying to say that i'm not against people making a profit uh cause that's what you in business to do to try and make a profit 

559.30 560.32 A: (( yeah )) 

562.89 572.19 B: but at the same time let's do it in the name of the people and the betterment of society in general and uh pass some of the wealth down 

567.89 568.67 A: yeah 

572.18 573.00 A: yeah 

572.36 573.36 B: you know 

573.27 574.94 A: (( i )) 

573.41 574.40 B: (( um )) 

574.84 578.55 B: but uh i i just don't know i just don't know 

578.67 586.38 B: um [lipsmack] well what about the martha stewart thing you think they kinda came down a little too hard on her i'm 

584.96 589.24 A: yeah i think they did come down i think they were just after a big name 

588.63 599.89 B: right i think they were after big name i think it it did not it hurt her being a female and with that attitude that she displayed and i think they just i think she hadn't done no 

596.40 597.20 A: yeah
