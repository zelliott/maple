69.92 75.45 B: or do you have any idea i i have to kinda think it over a little bit 

75.31 77.03 A: um [sigh] 

77.54 80.74 A: yeah this is interesting i [sigh] think i just see uh 

82.18 86.59 A: i mean i i don't think it helps the economy um 

87.59 91.71 A: i mean i assume they're referring to like the the enron stuff 

91.57 93.15 B: yeah yeah 

92.25 98.05 A: and you know martha stewart and [sigh] and her broker and and that kinda stuff um 

97.15 103.99 B: how how their um business activities affected the economy is that what yeah okay yeah 

101.97 104.03 A: right um 

104.06 105.72 A: and i think 

106.71 111.39 A: [mn] i think it just points to a a a larger problem that 

112.26 116.20 A: that you have these c._e._o.s and high up executives 

116.85 121.64 A: making tens and hundreds of m- of millions of dollars 

118.82 120.23 B: yeah cronies 

121.61 122.49 B: uh-huh 

122.03 123.89 A: and 

123.97 129.07 A: you know all while all the time their company's still losing money they're laying off workers 

129.14 130.35 A: and 

129.25 132.80 B: and then it makes you wonder how much more of this is going on 

132.59 133.72 A: (( right right )) 

132.86 138.04 B: behind our backs 'cause that was enron you know that was a major company 

135.31 136.13 A: right 

138.13 143.21 B: you know i think seventh wasn't it the seventh largest company in the world or seventh in america maybe 

138.27 139.34 A: right 

142.89 143.76 A: right 

143.38 146.16 B: something like that and then you've got these 

146.21 151.82 B: you know smaller companies you're you're wondering are they doing you know this was [mn] on a major scale you know 

151.32 152.61 A: yeah exactly 

151.84 154.95 B: when [mn] you know what else is going on you know 

155.12 157.05 A: right and i i just [sigh] 

157.78 161.37 A: i mean how many how many jobs could you save 

162.22 164.67 A: i mean if if you have an executive making 

164.69 168.78 A: even ten million dollars which is i'd say that's that's low that's the low end 

168.54 169.43 B: uh-huh 

169.06 173.60 A: and instead of ten he takes he takes five million 

173.86 175.03 A: (( i mean you can )) 

175.77 182.64 A: you can give a lot of people jobs at five million dollars enough to to feed their families and 

178.97 180.40 B: exactly 

181.87 185.56 B: fifty wait how many families exactly 

184.88 188.80 A: i mean if you have if you have if you have five million dollars 

189.18 190.37 A: you can pay 

189.44 190.39 B: (( uh-huh )) 

190.40 192.32 A: you can pay a hundred people 

192.28 194.18 B: exactly a hundred families 

192.39 193.58 A: fifty fifty 

193.66 196.12 A: fifty thousand dollars a year exactly 

195.73 197.70 B: mhm a hundred families 

197.45 198.59 A: i i that's 

198.54 200.71 B: and then also when you um 

200.76 201.60 B: when you're 

201.68 208.08 B: to you know you're not there is a hundred people not working doesn't that usually affect like a 

208.80 211.57 B: chain reaction it like hurts other 

211.41 212.14 A: (( ex- )) 

211.58 213.00 B: um economies 

212.33 218.64 A: exactly it's it it's it's a drain on the economy right and they're they're collecting unemployment 

218.88 222.82 A: and not and not working and they're not they're not able to contribute 

218.92 219.78 B: (( uh-uh )) 

222.85 223.69 B: (( mhm )) 

223.04 225.55 A: to the economy and it's right it's a [sigh] 

225.67 235.98 A: it's a drain and because they they're not they don't have jobs they're not spending and they're not putting that money back into the economy it's just sitting in the accounts of these executives who 

230.07 230.96 B: mhm 

236.70 239.59 A: are just holding on to it so it just seems 

239.79 242.96 A: overall pretty [sigh] destructive 

242.50 253.91 B: yeah i it was really a surprise to me for martha you know stewart you know you know living and everything and i really don't know um was she was she guilty do you know if she was ever 

248.41 249.41 A: (( mhm right )) 

254.16 258.67 A: [sigh] she i don't know i don't think she's gone to trial yet 

258.15 259.10 B: okay 

258.83 262.62 A: her the the guy that was her broker or her 

262.54 263.76 B: mhm 

263.21 269.41 A: s- i think it was her broker he was involved with her but he he is getting jail time 

269.54 272.69 B: so that might mean that she's you know in the same 

272.14 273.66 A: well well see her 

273.86 277.19 A: [sigh] they they didn't have as serious charges on her 

276.57 278.07 B: as as serious 

278.20 282.50 A: as a- as the guy managing the money but he 

278.46 279.56 B: (( okay mhm )) 

283.25 287.39 A: i mean that's i mean i think that's a a good step because a lot of these guys 

288.10 290.53 A: you know they give 'em a slap on the wrist 

290.71 295.37 A: and say don't do it again i think giving this guy jail time is a [sigh] 

295.73 298.81 A: is a good sign i mean it's a deterrent 

297.88 301.96 B: and it's also hitting these other brokers like we can't you know 

301.54 302.67 A: right 

302.05 303.82 B: you're not going to get away with this 

303.31 304.54 A: (( exactly no )) 

304.04 318.65 B: but er em what worries me i think the most is our economy is not doing good [laughter] as you know i mean it's going up and then it's going down a lot and then it goes up a little bit you know and it keeps on going down right so 

315.63 316.56 A: (( [noise] right right )) 

319.01 333.61 B: what's the credibility of the public gonna think you know they're not it's not going to help when you have people you know still doing th- you know they're going under and it's just d- i mean it's just gonna hurt the economy even more won't it i mean wouldn't it 

333.92 340.92 B: 'cause i- we don't believe in these major companies because they're running or they're park- you know what i'm saying parking money or whatever 

340.58 341.73 A: (( right yeah )) 

341.15 343.16 B: but they do whatever they're doing you know 

343.83 344.81 B: so 

343.97 345.68 A: i yeah go ahead 

345.71 347.49 B: oh i'm i'm finished i 

347.66 349.12 A: (( all right um )) 

350.50 352.01 A: i guess it's it's 

352.44 354.29 A: i guess the other part of the question 

354.36 356.63 A: we're supposed to address is um 

357.01 360.55 A: about what what the government can do or what can be done 

360.79 362.95 B: what can be done ah 

361.75 362.60 A: to 

363.19 364.49 A: (( about this mhm )) 

364.25 370.77 B: well um it sounds like they might be they've already started it ever since the enron it seems like they're 

370.91 376.27 B: er the government's been cracking down a little bit you know saying like with the ah the stewart 

376.37 379.98 B: you know they didn't take they got um yeah they 

380.26 386.17 B: they found that out right that they'd been doing some illegal activities right so 

386.40 388.65 B: but still i don't know um 

388.80 392.86 B: what do you think [laughter] the government could do that would change this 

392.84 393.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

392.98 394.46 B: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

394.85 396.98 A: (( [sigh] i mean i think )) 

398.50 402.38 A: [sigh] i i mean i don't i don't know where you stand politically 

402.05 402.97 B: okay 

402.52 404.49 A: um i i 

404.52 407.32 A: i'm on the i'm to the left of center 

407.83 408.83 A: (( [sigh] so )) 

409.45 411.98 A: i think that 

412.11 423.52 A: a big problem is the influence that big business has on our government a- and i think that when you have i mean i know there has been campaign finance reform 

418.12 419.31 B: (( okay mhm )) 

423.20 424.24 B: mhm 

423.62 427.04 A: and i think it's i think it's a good step 

427.81 428.79 A: (( um [mn] )) 

430.09 436.51 A: but i also think that it [sigh] that a lot of politicians democrats and republicans 

436.62 441.44 A: are still beholden to the interests of big business because that's 

441.49 446.79 A: why they're in office that's why they got elected was 'cause of the money from from these companies 

446.97 447.87 A: and so 

448.17 453.07 A: they are much less willing to support legislation 

453.28 454.28 B: yeah 

453.69 456.78 A: that is gonna potentially hurt these 

456.79 461.58 A: these companies 'cause i mean let's face it like anyone else they value their jobs 

461.60 462.54 B: mhm 

461.88 473.08 A: and the way for them s- to keep their jobs is to is to have enough money in the in the you know the the war chest to to get reelected and mhm 

470.49 471.54 B: mhm 

472.45 473.64 B: and these are 

473.86 476.56 B: politicians i've noticed i always [laughter] 

476.85 490.61 B: personally i always thought er democrats were more so but yeah you're finding republicans a- as much i'm i'm i stand republican personally but i noticed that republicans ye- what was it er 

486.34 487.16 A: okay 

490.76 493.35 B: didn't was it dick cheney the one who 

493.36 497.92 B: did some er was something to do with enron connection there 

497.53 499.10 A: oh yeah 

498.37 512.58 B: dick cheney was there was a direct connection somehow i don't i can't remember if they i think they gave uh funding to get him into office and you know and who knows that money wasn't really that their money you know what i'm saying they 

511.19 512.30 A: (( mhm [sigh] yeah )) 

512.63 518.84 B: they had money they were doing illegal activities and that you remember florida right you know how florida 

518.38 519.58 A: right 

518.97 519.85 B: um 

520.20 524.07 B: it let's just say they did not the okay enron 

524.48 528.86 B: pu- i- didn't they yeah they supported er the bush campaign 

528.57 529.56 A: (( right [noise] )) 

528.99 533.04 B: put in their money and whatever how that works you know 

533.47 535.41 B: [cough] and that money 

535.64 548.58 B: could have went easily to a little bit of helping ads in florida and it mi- maybe if that money was not there there co- it could have been a whole different election remember i think florida lo- what was the difference between [mn] gore and bush 

549.18 550.84 B: (( you know what i'm saying in the election )) 

550.31 553.19 A: right florida was the difference i mean it ended up being 

554.26 556.24 B: was it still a landslide though 

556.29 558.73 A: oh no no florida florida was 

558.99 561.23 A: florida was the deciding state and 

560.77 561.89 B: (( not i- mhm )) 

561.24 575.54 A: it was very close and you remember all that the huge problems with the counting of the votes and that yeah the hanging chad and and but it ended up being decided by the supreme court 

567.41 568.92 B: the chads yeah 

575.29 576.53 B: oh did it 

575.94 577.00 A: um 

577.24 578.21 A: which 

579.14 584.83 A: um this is i mean i'm a i'm a political science major the the supreme court 

585.52 586.64 B: mhm 

585.99 599.89 A: their role is not supposed to i mean this is what it says in the constitution anyway different people interpret it differently but their role is not supposed to extend their jurisdiction does not extend into the political 

592.56 593.49 B: mhm
