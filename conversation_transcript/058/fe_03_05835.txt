20.46 22.71 A: (( yeah i live in america yes [noise] )) 

22.12 32.76 B: oh cool cool cool so um you know about you're up to date about well the enron scandal uh m. c. i. m. m. c. i. m. c. i. worldcom 

29.30 30.30 A: yeah 

32.53 34.06 A: certainly yeah yes 

33.92 36.42 B: (( yes to some extent um )) 

36.45 38.76 B: (( y- i )) 

38.94 47.82 B: feel i don't know i don't feel that the government personally can do too much about this because i feel that that the government is allowing it to happen you know 

47.77 58.03 A: yeah government doesn't they are not entrusted in these sort of things because it's just business the government running bus- government is in all this and the type of business like enron 

58.55 60.59 A: the only difference is that 

61.61 65.90 A: who are in the government they get more publicity than those people in enron 

65.71 66.95 B: (( [noise] right )) 

66.09 67.58 A: that's the only difference 

68.06 72.97 B: (( yeah and um and and these companies are are funding campaigns )) 

73.08 76.59 B: so it's like a good example would be 

77.00 90.97 B: (( [lipsmack] martha stewart martha stewart makes makes a a faulty business transaction and she gets busted but the the top guys from enron and the top guys from m. c. i. have yet to have yet to face a court )) 

90.50 91.84 A: yeah that's true 

91.30 99.32 B: yet yeah because martha stewart doesn't uh i- isn't giving welcome money to the republican party but the enron guys are 

98.98 102.12 A: yeah that's true exactly 

101.72 102.80 B: (( yeah oh )) 

103.70 104.56 B: (( okay )) 

103.85 109.19 A: and a- so far as i know bush made the i mean they're making the same mistakes i mean 

109.20 112.96 A: uh in so funding our country in a good manner 

113.01 125.74 A: they are going there while it's necessary but you know they're going into a lot of different stuff at the same time you know without real proof and things like that and uh you know management it's mismanagement actually 

125.57 131.92 A: and they're not accountable i mean they're not accountable to anybody but people in enron yeah the papers they are 

132.23 137.59 A: coming with the stories so we are reading it so a lot of pressure on them 

137.61 143.41 A: on the d. a. and people like that authority to get them book them but you know 

144.98 150.14 B: yeah you're right i- i- it's a real shame it's like 

149.98 160.85 B: [lipsmack] um you know the enron and the m. c. i. scandals um enron and the worldcom scandal happened and then the president gets on television and is like i'm gonna put all these 

160.75 174.51 B: these laws into place that are gonna ensure that this never happens to protect to protect the uh the stockholder but when you think about it it's kind of like look at dick chaney i mean dick chaney owned a 

168.45 169.84 A: yes that's true 

174.51 178.69 B: (( oh hel- he's the c. e. o. of halliburton which is a huge energy company )) 

178.21 179.12 A: yes 

178.56 189.55 B: in a- and enron was an energy company they all worked together so it's like it's not the interest of the common shareholder it's the interest of the people at the top you know 

189.34 190.41 A: yes 

190.25 195.71 B: and it's also like an any any an exchange of like money amongst cronies 

195.87 196.69 A: yes 

197.03 198.25 B: and uh 

197.10 210.41 A: and al- also the the media the media is playing a you know a role that's not very good because if they don't like somebody then you know all the papers and everything that gets noticed but real issue 

211.02 213.54 A: like you said the enron i mean 

214.16 218.38 A: like they talked about martha stewart they didn't talk about the enron people 

218.42 219.80 B: right 

219.20 225.01 A: (( so that's why you know martha stewart is getting you know all this bad publicity but the other guys are not )) 

225.09 232.88 B: right and not to mention that i i i believe that the press is slanted itself you know like 

232.86 247.57 B: each newspaper has some sort of political slant and when we're talking about big newspapers like the u._s._a. today the new york times i mean these are huge huge companies you know with lots of money and lots of power 

247.34 250.63 B: and they have lots of influence and so 

251.19 255.57 B: you you nev- you never know what what truth you're getting you know 

255.56 256.84 A: (( mm yes )) 

257.03 263.61 B: (( yeah one of the questions they asked us was uh how how has this affected us has it affected you personally at all )) 

264.17 265.58 A: excuse me 

265.33 276.53 B: has uh one of the questions that the the uh automatic thing asked asked us was uh how these scandals have uh have they personally affected us have they affected you personally at all 

275.78 280.54 A: yeah no not not me personally but some of my friends yes and a 

279.76 280.71 B: yeah 

281.97 287.89 B: (( yeah i i guess i could personally affected me to some extent is that um )) 

288.65 295.06 B: (( the economy's really bad right now and and it's it's not it's not not getting any better you know )) 

294.88 300.28 A: yeah it's starting this all this is adding to it you know the money's going into certain people's pockets 

300.78 303.81 A: and we the common people we are suffering 

300.95 301.85 B: right 

304.62 317.81 B: yeah i- i- it's true and then now you know you read on the paper today that uh that they project that there's a four hundred and fifty five billion dollar deficit in the budget the biggest that this country's ever seen 

317.62 318.47 A: yes 

318.54 332.03 B: and you're like okay so now we have these scandals and like i don't trust the government because i mean george bush said it himself when he was running that he was gonna run the country like like like a like a business [laughter] 

331.01 335.48 A: yes but even if it was like a business good business it was okay 

335.68 337.50 A: (( really bad business )) 

337.66 338.31 A: (( they )) 

338.49 342.15 A: are publicity stuff than into actual running of things 

343.81 346.12 B: (( yeah could you say that one more time )) 

346.06 355.96 A: i mean this people i mean if they were running a good business it was good but they're more into getting publicity instead of running a business you know 

356.04 357.20 B: right 

357.42 364.82 B: right yeah so it's it's all about it- it- it's kind of like bringing up a the idea of fame as a commodity 

364.29 365.20 A: yes 

364.59 377.37 B: it's like everybody wants to be famous at any cost so that they w- whether you're selling cars making movies or or trying to run a country like everyone wants fame and wants to be looked at as 

368.69 369.66 A: yes 

377.33 380.40 B: some kind of american symbol 

382.11 383.65 B: kinda depressing

476.48 477.95 B: yeah you're right 

476.66 481.09 A: at that time this enron problem came uh i think at that time 

481.55 484.07 A: but nobody noticed it because of the war 

485.13 487.91 B: yeah everyone was so quick to like 

487.95 495.97 B: ju- jump on the bandwagon of this emotional war and it's not even justified this war's is bullshit [laughter] it's stupid 

495.06 496.02 A: (( [noise] )) 

496.24 500.69 A: and i know what is happening in my country because this government wanted people 

500.76 502.85 A: (( um from india soldiers )) 

502.90 506.04 A: to go to iraq to replace american soldiers 

506.26 513.63 A: so now they're like you know giving out a lot of stuff i mean they are saying that we will give you this and that if you send soldiers 

513.65 515.59 A: so i mean there is no 

515.81 520.69 A: anything behind that you know any of this move if you look at it back in that way 

517.68 518.67 B: yeah 

521.08 526.43 A: one country spilling out of a country will give you all the stuff just to send you a soldier so you know

549.71 552.66 A: so this is what is going on in this world bribery 

553.15 554.26 B: (( yeah )) 

553.34 562.44 A: cause it starts from the top like the government is doing this it's some countries are doing this the government is doing this then they cannot tell the people not to do that
