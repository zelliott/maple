0.85 3.01 B: hi my name is john 

3.00 5.59 A: (( h- hi this is from new york )) 

5.96 7.43 B: from new york 

6.78 7.82 A: yes oh 

7.51 9.89 B: i'm in new york as well 

8.78 10.02 A: okay 

10.54 12.00 A: (( ah so um )) 

11.20 15.18 B: where are you where are you from originally you sound like you have an accent or something 

14.45 19.73 A: yes i do i'm from sri lanka initially sri lanka 

17.50 18.55 B: from where 

19.41 20.92 B: oh sri lanka okay 

20.47 28.06 A: sri lanka ah yes and so you go ahead you start this is not a topic that i'm an expert at 

27.67 28.82 B: [laughter] 

28.79 30.92 A: [laughter] 

28.85 36.60 B: me neither um i'm this is not one of my my better topics i guess but what does family mean to me i 

36.81 38.81 B: i suppose um 

39.62 47.05 B: m- my definition of family ha- is is not exactly a definition of family that that i wish it were um 

47.42 50.51 B: i think i i define family more 

50.83 60.97 B: more in line with ah my friends and the people i'm surrounded by on a consistent basis who have shown themselves to be there more than my actual family has 

60.99 63.13 B: so ah to me 

63.26 74.85 B: my friends would ah fulfil a definition of family that you know are people who you can con- consistently rely who ah show you unconditional love and you know will always be 

75.33 82.43 A: yeah i guess the same thing is true for me ah especially since my family is all over the world 

80.29 82.47 B: (( there ah )) 

82.94 89.32 A: ah so i do have some family here in the u._s. but i don't see them that often enough so 

89.40 93.23 A: (( ah because of the lifestyle here ah i mean is quite different )) 

93.36 100.58 A: so it's not like even if you have family unless they are living like literally next door you know i'm going to see them very often 

99.49 103.26 B: mhm 

100.66 108.88 A: ah so you ah ah go and see them during thanksgiving or christmas breaks and so on so i do the same thing so i i see them usually once a 

108.87 122.45 A: year kind of thing but ah yeah so i do kind of consider my family to be my friends too i mean i hang out with them much more and they are we help each other much more in the 

122.31 134.20 B: yeah right yeah it's it do you think that do you think that kind of changes you what what happens when you find someone to settle down with if you do do they do that your friends do they ah drop away 

122.71 124.25 A: (( way so )) 

130.53 131.12 A: (( [mn] )) 

134.20 138.42 B: from being your current family and does it become this other you know 

139.25 153.14 A: yeah i interestingly i do notice that because i'm single but i know friends who get married and before they get married i mean they hang out all the time and they kind of depend on you for ah all kinds of for um 

139.25 140.02 B: new 

145.58 147.20 B: (( yeah )) 

153.22 161.52 A: and then kind of ah once they get married interestingly i kind of think ah of the task like putting all the eggs in the one in one basket [laughter] 

161.31 168.27 A: kind of like they can feel the change and they you could never see them and they i mean they used to call ah ah 

166.59 170.22 B: (( right )) 

168.43 179.71 A: like every week and now they don't even like return phone calls kind of thing so it's kind of somewhat amazing to see that change so people do like to have families well at least a lot of 

179.49 191.43 A: [mn] people like to have families it looks like but they don't have that opportunity or the current situation means they don't have that so they kind of depend on their friends maybe 

191.33 198.40 B: yeah that's that's a weird i mean what do you think about that that and that once people do find that significant other they their 

198.45 202.37 B: friends or you know family or however you want to define it drop away 

202.27 215.70 B: and all this effort is put like you said all their eggs are put into one basket when earlier they they had eggs their eggs spread out among an entire network of people and now it's like they have only one you know and like how 

202.42 205.13 A: (( i )) 

215.74 219.63 B: what happened there because it's not like those those friends are always there you know 

219.65 234.44 A: know i i it's kind of f- funny because the again they are my friends so i don't want nothing bad to happen but but i wonder what's like if something happens in let's say five years down the line or ten years down the line if they get separated then it's almost like their 

234.21 243.65 A: ah world ends because they no longer have any friends and they only had their family kind of thing and i have seen that happening to like ah some of the my 

243.47 252.90 A: older friends who have married and and they get separated and they suddenly kind of think that ah the world has changed for them completely because 

245.03 245.61 B: (( right )) 

253.21 259.46 A: ah everything revolved around the the immediate family for them for a few years for a few years and now [mn] 

260.27 273.57 A: ah they they had to change their lifestyle and they have to do a lot of things in a diff- in a different way so they take a l- long time to adjust and i think they maybe their like i said i mean i know that you have have 

261.07 265.47 B: (( yeah )) 

266.69 267.47 B: (( oh )) 

273.58 286.55 A: people if you're family if you get married and so on but i think they people may be better off actually to having ah some friends not just for the sake of it like being and having some friends ah 

287.26 288.40 B: yeah 

288.56 296.20 B: hm i don't know it i i find it actually the reason that i found it hard to actually get any kind of relationship is because i'm more committed to my friends 

289.27 290.38 A: or have this 

296.22 307.15 B: than i am to any than the desire to get any real deep relationship you know i don't know if that's my age i'm twenty two so you know that's maybe the period i'm going through but 

300.40 301.72 A: mhm 

307.02 318.27 B: you know it just kind of seems um it seems limiting honestly to to devote so much energy to one ah one person and drop away so many other factors of your life 

318.25 324.78 A: well ah i wonder how you would feel like ten or fifteen years from now which is kind of where i am 

324.12 325.09 B: that's true 

324.82 327.37 A: ah so um ah 

326.67 332.46 B: how do you feel about that do you think i mean do you do you want to find are you looking for someone or pursuing anything mm 

332.33 342.72 A: oh well i do have ah what i would kind of call companion so but um at the same time like ah it it doesn't mean that i don't have friends 

343.20 349.23 B: right right yeah i i guess that's the idea if you can maintain a well balanced 

343.89 346.53 A: (( um i'm i'm single )) 

350.12 353.30 B: you know with whoever and your friends too 

350.23 361.38 A: yeah yeah and also the other thing that this ah works for or against it is my my girlfriend or companion she's 

361.25 368.16 A: she is ah living ah like on the other side of the country yes so 

366.52 371.05 B: oh yes that's that's that's difficult 

370.43 375.95 A: yeah i mean in a way it is not too bad because i like living in new york city i have friends here so [mn] 

376.02 380.19 A: ah it kind of like works out well ah so in a certain sense ah 

380.73 387.21 B: mm what do you think ah when you when you decide to raise a family where do you think you'll stay will you stay in new york 

386.67 390.01 A: um [mn] it depends 

388.46 390.13 B: (( or you like sri lanka )) 

390.18 396.82 A: ah no actually this is going to be a probably a pain you know because if i go back i'll get a reverse culture shock i have kind of lived 

397.19 399.75 A: almost more than half my life here now 

399.79 401.06 A: and so 

400.62 401.36 B: (( okay )) 

402.22 408.54 A: um ah i do like new york city so it's going to be like quite tough for me and my girlfriend is not from sri lanka 

408.60 417.68 A: so ah and like she doesn't she doesn't like new york city so it's kind of like ah she's from india ah so 

409.66 410.73 B: (( where )) 

412.17 413.46 B: where is she from 

415.59 416.47 B: okay 

418.67 419.49 B: (( wow )) 

419.48 420.58 A: um 

420.91 425.45 B: yeah so i don't know ah where where do you live in manhattan oh do you live in manhattan or 

424.77 429.92 A: yeah i do i live ah in the upper part upper manhattan 

429.97 431.69 B: (( oh in new york )) 

431.25 433.99 A: ah excuse me 

432.74 435.21 B: ah did you say where'd you say on the upper part 

434.13 437.01 A: [noise] ah yeah upper manhattan 

436.40 438.89 B: okay i live on the east side upper east side so 

438.24 439.95 A: oh okay okay 

440.69 442.08 A: (( ah so )) 

441.56 455.27 B: yeah i don't know it'd be an interesting experience to start a family here ah just coming from from saint louis which is very mid western and you know like ah suburbia and you have everyone has their yard and their dogs 

452.09 455.35 A: yeah 

455.48 459.61 B: i guess everyone has a yard and their dogs here but every- everything's just much smaller 

455.83 456.83 A: (( ah )) 

459.53 460.57 A: uh-huh 

460.55 463.09 B: (( so i don't i it i you know )) 

463.14 468.76 B: i think about all the advantages of you know all the cultural things you can expose your family too 

468.84 479.12 B: and you know all the things you can be a part of but it's just you know the cost of living is so high and i think there are a lot of opportunities that a lot of kids well these kids are 

479.00 491.09 B: you that you might miss because everything is so much more expensive and m- much more competitive here you know i used to play in a soccer team in like springfield where i grew up and um 

486.12 495.28 A: mhm 

491.40 504.90 B: here to play on their soccer team you have to be playing since you're like one year old it's just so competitive so it's like there's some some of those family values that you might want to you know share with your family ah can kind of disappear with the environment that you're in okay mhm 

496.87 499.10 A: yeah 

503.21 512.68 A: but even in suburbia you see that i mean i m- i have i said i have family here my brother lives in ah michigan and i notice 

512.65 519.67 A: that [mn] even there like my brother is he's kind of aware of this so he self consciously 

520.38 529.45 A: makes sure that ah if ah like the children don't grow up in that company that environment kind of thing ah ov- overly competitive i should say but 

525.54 526.68 B: right 

528.73 529.46 B: (( [laughter] )) 

529.24 541.80 A: but even there i notice that like i mean he his kids are go do like gymnastics and soccer and skating and all those things but to them it's a competition among 

539.48 540.52 B: yeah 

541.61 545.25 A: parents ah more than the kids you know they 

544.46 547.77 B: [laughter] yeah i guess wow 

548.04 557.84 B: it's like i i know also my parents are like there not they've been you know in a relationship for what like ah gees like twenty eight years or something you know thirty years 

557.34 558.31 A: uh-huh 

557.60 568.44 B: that they don't i mean their their friends now especially have really gone away and like their their friendships with people have really become you know focussed i guess my mother has made some more friends as she's 

568.34 580.46 B: ah through us through my sister and i a- as through school than through things like that but their friends from college and their friends from you know everywhere else have definitely dropped away because of the emphasis on the family have you found that as 

580.55 586.91 B: as you as you've grown older ha- have you maintained your friendships for long periods of time do 

586.05 593.04 A: s- like you said since i'm single it's easier for me but i kind of see that happening after that my friends would 

591.15 598.27 B: (( you still have your but but you still have your friends from even e- even that 'cause you are single do you still have your friends from college i mean )) 

597.39 599.95 A: ah yes actually i do have
