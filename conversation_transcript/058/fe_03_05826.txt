1.04 2.63 A: (( [lipsmack] hello )) 

2.55 5.00 B: hello uh my name is bill 

5.39 7.63 A: hi my name's jarrod how're you doing 

7.48 21.47 B: jarrod i'm doing fine and uh this cause this is the second time that i've done this and yesterday the phone rang properly at five o'clock as it did just now so i i i have a good in- indication it's going to be a conversational call 

21.40 27.64 B: and jarrod a- as you understood it the topic that we're uh that w- uh we should be discussing today is what 

28.05 36.70 A: um the topic that i myself understand it going in and out but i heard that it had to do with um i guess h- like just the 

32.02 32.79 B: uh-huh 

36.75 45.57 A: kind of scandals that have been happening with large companies in the u._s. and if it's affecting the economy and if it's making the economy sour or not is that what you got from it 

44.88 54.34 B: that was one part of it a- and i guess the first part of it uh that i understood in a more general sense was should government be dictating 

54.40 60.32 B: uh ethics and a- a- ethics in business uh 

59.31 61.02 A: (( hm )) 

60.80 63.75 B: and i just just a comment on that with the uh 

64.72 74.22 B: u- i mean my uh one of my uh one of my educational background i have a economics degree from the local uh emery university so that may bias my 

70.65 71.62 A: oh okay 

74.49 85.38 B: answer but you know my quick answer to this you know should should government have a hand in uh dictating ethics to businesses is no no because uh you know my feeling about that is that 

85.60 98.30 B: uh we live in a consumer capitalistic society people have a choice as to where's to go um you know and and people are gonna go where they want to where they feel most comfortable where they feel 

98.09 106.80 B: for lack of a better term uh most at home if there's uh two businesses down down down the street where everything is the same except one is 

106.76 116.26 B: obviously crooked and one isn't you know i i i think we as as ethical consumers are gonna go to that business that is more like us more ethical 

116.44 126.68 B: and over time the uh the unethical or or crook business again everything else being equal is gonna go out of business because no one's gonna go there they have you know they're selling no goods they have no profits so 

126.70 135.88 B: no i don't think the government should really s- be uh meddling in that cause i think i think the system takes takes care of that itself over time 

135.75 138.87 A: [lipsmack] well i i guess um just on 

138.75 141.85 A: like smaller business just as far as you know 

141.81 155.37 A: individual like commerce or you know just sales and everything i can definitely agree with your points but i don't like if like the larger ethics as far as large companies as far as hiring as far as large companies have to treat all their employees and everything that's where i would also 

155.16 158.79 A: view the question so i think it definitely works out on its own 

158.37 172.06 B: so jarrod let's say large costs you mentioned large companies employees and having the i think you h- i think you mentioned the word having to having to treat them well are are you saying the government should mandate how employees are treated in the corporate environment uh- 

171.62 174.99 A: no no of course not i i would i would definitely not want 

175.01 187.40 A: too much other government control just as far as ethics just say companies and ethics it seems like a large topic and it's like how they treat consumers and how they treat their employees or you know different obviously different subjects at hand 

181.98 183.68 B: well i know but you know but 

185.96 199.56 B: no i mean but y- you were very fast to say oh no government should not have a hand in that but actually government has a very large overriding hand in how in in the employer employee relationship um you know 

198.88 202.76 A: oh of course i yeah it's a huge ethical 

202.33 211.29 B: like for example y- you know i i mean i myself do not work in an office so i'm not really up on all this but anecdotally for example uh that whole what do y- um 

207.84 208.93 A: really 

211.28 217.71 B: sexual harassment thing i mean this this is an exaggeration but the government says i can't go to a female and say 

217.56 229.70 B: 'female you know that outfit you're wearing is a gorgeous outfit' that's like some sort of some form of sexual harassment and it's dictated by the government in you know to impose uh ethics in in in in the workplace i 

229.57 236.20 B: mean is that right do i want the government dictating that or or d- does the government need to be dictating that 

236.30 251.19 A: well i mean i think that they have there's been such like strong events that have really gone against women in the workplace for so long that i mean some of these laws that might mean to be just to a you know a cause utilization but they'll end up being so 

249.20 250.19 B: (( is that right mhm )) 

251.20 265.59 A: strong and powerful to try to um not have anything go against you they a- almost have the opposite effect of actually having any kind of compliments at all given that you extra power to females they say well i can say it's sexual harassment and that's right uh 

263.89 264.68 B: right 

265.20 266.19 B: (( right mhm )) 

265.62 267.58 A: some p. c. things which i 

267.65 273.96 A: obviously entirely agree with and want to happen like some like parts of affirmative action of course everybody wants 

273.82 287.83 A: you know more education from people who have harsher like socio economic backgrounds so why not just go like okay if you're not of a you know white background then you get advantage obviously over correct 

285.75 286.80 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

287.88 297.61 A: so when added to like part of the government what what they want and like the people walking all over you know the correction was a good idea but i- it seems to be 

288.58 289.62 B: (( they all go through )) 

297.84 303.61 A: d- difficult to go so far but it's such a delicate item that people it's hard for people to disagree with it 

303.00 316.04 B: well jarrod you know i mean i still go back to the uh in the uh invisible hand and government does not need to be involved and things will take care of themselves in our our in our capitalistic market place like given that 

316.23 331.08 B: sexual harassment example i spoke of again still covers everything else being equal you know one company let employees get away with that one company doesn't you know where wom- where are women gonna go they're gon- they're gonna leave the company that let them get away with that and go to the company that you know 

330.88 332.71 B: i- imposes rules 

332.76 338.17 B: on themselves and you know d- d- doesn't need the government t- to to do that for them 

337.89 345.51 A: well i mean i i partially agree with that but sometimes when if it's like like now with the hard hard job market or an employee has to really 

343.35 344.14 B: uh-huh 

345.50 352.69 A: you know work at a certain market she doesn't really have like that choice and it just sometimes a little idealistic 

349.11 351.88 B: that's a very good point very good point really 

352.51 360.88 A: just say don't go where they wanna go and where they're treated best cause you can't always do that but it's still like you'd like to think it was working like that [lipsmack] 

360.04 365.06 B: mhm sometimes y- y- you just gotta put up with it because you have no choice is what you're saying 

365.01 370.54 A: yeah yeah sometimes like a lot of people don't have choices of where they work or the positions they're at 

365.95 366.93 B: (( mhm )) 

370.36 377.13 B: right a- a- i guess it goes back to the how this whole chu- how our ch- child labor law started i mean 

377.14 378.62 B: you know um 

379.88 390.54 B: the the the the government imposed having kids not work before the age of twelve and and so forth but you know what choice did the kids have at that point you know the ki- the kids needed to bring home a buck quarter a day 

390.51 397.30 A: yeah yeah it's tough when they're like you say you can only work the hours but there is no way we prefer to work more we need to work more 

396.77 397.84 B: (( mm mhm )) 

397.86 412.63 A: it's tough but i mean a- a- and that point i think i mean kids were actually you know like and they were like like their lives by like um middle to like late teenage years are just they're being destroyed and that was 

404.78 405.96 B: right 

411.96 413.69 B: (( mhm )) 

413.18 416.75 A: like pretty tough to like really continue even if the kids wanted to 

417.24 420.51 A: but still a good point i mean i don't know i i guess 

420.61 421.68 A: (( do you )) 

421.81 430.22 A: do you feel like at a larger level that it's really hurt the economy like the what what they've been saying either control or non control i mean 

426.22 428.19 B: (( [noise] maybe um m- you mean )) 

429.40 435.64 B: like for example if m. c. i. worldcom um making up eight eight bill- uh eleven billion dollars worth of profits 

435.68 442.75 B: um yeah i mean it's not hurting me directly but actually it's hurting me indirectly cause my uh cause susan who um who i live with 

442.49 444.12 A: mhm 

442.93 452.53 B: was an m. c. i. employee for five years she held a bunch of you know as that's where all her pension money was and stock money was and you know sh- it went from this is 

452.31 462.52 B: thousands too and it went from ninety five thousand to the point eleven cents you know that that's a pretty heft cut in your uh in in in in your nest egg 

456.84 457.85 A: [laughter] 

458.62 459.57 A: jeez 

462.50 464.87 A: (( yeah i )) 

465.31 476.70 B: and there were a lot of people u- affected uh not only were m. c. i. worldcom's peop- empl- employ- direct employees affected by it but i think a go- good part of the popu- 

466.17 466.92 A: (( suppose )) 

477.40 482.27 B: um uh even jar- um what company do you work with for example 

481.95 488.04 A: me i've just actually been temping with uh random house publishing which is a large book publishing company 

485.91 487.23 B: okay yeah 

487.60 497.06 B: you know random house has a has a pension plan and they invest in stocks and one of the stocks they probably invested in was worldcom so you know you directly lost some money because of that 

496.44 498.35 A: yeah 

498.42 505.35 A: but i guess just because uh like the large companies are so connected nowadays it's like almost everybody's floating something 

504.96 506.03 B: (( mm )) 

505.46 508.35 A: when one company goes down it's like 

508.73 513.49 A: i don't know you appear to me that it would affect almost every it's frustrating 

512.87 522.30 B: uh-huh uh-huh but you know has it affected the common general uh i- i think i think i think that that's a question that that that that they're gonna we can really address cause we don't know 

522.42 529.00 A: yeah i would like to say i could really speak about [laughter] that but if i really knew much real- about that then uh 

525.58 526.14 B: (( [mn] )) 

529.23 535.92 A: you know i'd like to really go and do something about it but it i don't know the only obvious situations have been 

535.18 541.70 B: have have you ever been in a workplace situation where you saw something right in front of you that was very unethical 

541.83 546.34 B: and and had to make a a decision as to whether to blow the whistle or anything like 

546.86 551.81 A: i've actually had many good environments where i haven't really seen that i've had 

551.77 557.51 A: certain employees either talk to me more about how sometimes they're uncomfortable around a certain man 

557.35 558.14 B: (( that mm )) 

557.44 569.12 A: but i but it's it's never been to the point where they really felt like um like they had to leave the job or that they had that they really had to say something about this man because he's really 

568.92 574.88 A: hurting the field sort of thing they would just say in general that they didn't like this guy or he rubbed a little too far on women 

574.93 575.97 B: (( mhm the )) 

574.95 578.42 A: (( like i guess as far as i've never i don't have )) 

578.45 580.99 A: any problems with that but i mean i also 

581.23 587.87 A: consider myself lucky or i guess i was growing up in a fairly liberal atmosphere so i was never really 

585.72 587.00 B: mhm right 

587.76 597.38 A: i don't take people to really be coming across that way i don't really i guess would just take people to be more universally discriminatory so 

590.34 591.28 B: (( mhm )) 

595.04 595.87 B: right 

596.13 599.89 B: just a little quick just a little quick story on uh from from my end regarding
