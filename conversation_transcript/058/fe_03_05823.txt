15.12 16.69 B: (( all right good stuff )) 

16.94 20.21 B: so what are the topics here it's about um 

20.72 22.25 B: (( corporate )) 

21.66 23.44 A: ethics 

22.70 25.03 B: corporate ethics basically and 

23.56 25.70 A: yeah yeah we're doing that today 

25.37 29.99 B: and and how it's a- affected our lives i guess 

29.88 31.59 A: yeah 

31.24 33.17 B: alright um 

33.68 36.08 B: where shall we start 

35.83 36.74 A: well 

37.09 43.72 A: maybe we can talk about what our h- ha- happened in the recent past like enron and stuff 

43.65 44.77 B: right 

44.18 48.54 A: um and what it impact has been on the business 

48.73 49.81 B: right 

49.19 56.56 A: uh and how it would not reach us or what kind of impact that has on u- on us uh in real life 

56.58 59.81 B: right right 

59.13 60.73 A: (( [cough] some )) 

60.30 68.21 B: drill down into like any specific companies like enron in particular or enron what martha [laughter] stewart 

64.36 66.44 A: mhm 

67.50 71.00 A: (( it could be anything but uh who knows i m- there )) 

68.50 69.51 B: right 

71.04 80.02 A: are lots of new corporate scanners coming up and it's not just enron lately you might have heard martha stewart and [laughter] 

78.43 79.60 B: right 

80.13 86.45 A: so many things coming up all the time um but anyway the enron was a big one 

86.90 88.02 A: um 

88.04 102.50 A: and it's impact was not only just uh on the economy but also it went through to the politicians as well because of their uh involvement so i think it has far reaching implications um 

102.71 105.84 A: which were not just confined to the business world 

105.99 107.97 B: right right i mean 

108.33 111.93 B: what i what i wonder also is you know how much of this kinda stuff 

112.21 114.26 B: has been going on as well 

114.41 115.46 A: mhm 

114.60 118.07 B: in the past and then maybe there's just a lot more scrutiny 

118.14 131.13 B: now because of you know because one big thing like that or mul- multiplies things have come up well now you know we- we're going out and or the government or the f- or the f._c._c. 

122.48 123.43 A: yeah 

130.42 132.91 A: mhm 

131.16 135.33 B: is going out and you know playing watchdog a little bit more 

135.42 136.96 B: than perhaps before 

137.64 150.83 A: that's right that's right that kinda of scrutiny was always required and the positive thing about um th- this kind of catalyst that those companies other companies would be more cautious 

150.83 165.71 A: um an example of to learn uh out of this um incident and probably they would um try their best to avoid any such kind of mismanagement or any kind of unethical practice in the future 

159.94 160.50 B: (( [cough] )) 

166.07 167.18 B: right 

166.19 167.51 A: what do you think 

167.44 176.74 B: no i mean i think i think that's definitely one one positive that comes out of it is that you know you work towards reforming the system and now 

176.62 191.43 B: now i guess they're trying to i don't know if it's law or what but um people trying to or or or the government requiring that you know c._e._o.s sign off on the income statement you know so you know the you know they're gonna be 

187.69 191.19 A: (( mhm )) 

191.94 196.26 B: liable you know if it turns out that something on there is 

196.62 200.27 B: is false you know like they're gonna be held accountable 

200.58 202.51 A: (( yeah )) 

200.77 203.13 B: more s- i mean i think more 

203.66 206.87 B: in a legal way than than than previously 

207.14 209.18 A: right right so um 

209.36 217.13 A: probably this is going to end for more ethics uh in in first and ensure a in business 

216.89 217.82 B: (( right [cough] )) 

217.40 231.10 A: but uh what i don't understand that sometimes like some kind of scandals crop up and i i i have a uh i'm very much sure that a lot is going on in in terms of unethical practices but 

231.07 234.91 A: just few crop up i i don't understand why is it the media which 

234.99 237.67 A: hand picks few and um 

238.24 239.54 A: kind of uh 

239.68 243.06 A: you know propagates these kind of things or 

243.82 245.76 A: i know i don't see 

246.17 254.26 A: um consistency across the board um some of the issues are given more importance 

254.45 264.10 A: and some of them are given less importance and that's something which probably media chooses rather than the people in fact 

263.64 277.02 B: right no i i understand what you're saying it's kind of having a media setting the agenda as well as people and i don't remember the guy's name but i think he's like the district attorney or or something for the city of new york 

265.27 267.08 A: (( yeah )) 

267.80 268.71 A: yeah 

275.89 278.31 A: mhm 

276.86 285.38 B: and he was one of the people that were you know that was really driving um like that whole thing with like the chinese walls um 

284.21 285.78 A: yeah 

285.28 295.75 B: investment banks um advising their their clients and then on the analysts you know rating those same companies really well you know and you know the 

295.95 298.31 B: definitely kind of shady activities 

298.68 300.76 B: considering that you know they're 

300.81 309.02 B: also getting paid millions of dollars you know to be the investment bankers and then the analysts are pumping up the stocks as well um 

308.02 309.88 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

309.26 313.70 B: i- it a- and i guess that'd make i i don't remember the guy's name that was kind of 

313.81 316.64 B: driving that but i mean certainly you know he creates 

317.49 320.26 B: kind of an ag- the the agenda as well 

320.65 331.30 A: right there is another aspect of it that if media picks on somebody then that that gentleman or the lady or whoever the company wherever the company is they're 

331.71 345.22 A: it's so much talked about that the public opinion is formed in a negative way and before the trial or the jury could prove guilty or not guilty people start to think about them as guilty 

344.75 347.79 B: (( [mn] [noise] [cough] right right )) 

345.92 357.57 A: so so we we we we we really think that corporate ethics uh should be dealt with by the media especially in in a more careful manner than than they are dealing with them now 

358.28 360.65 B: right well 

361.82 362.95 B: but i guess 

363.20 364.27 B: um 

365.14 373.81 B: yeah i guess that just depends on on on how it's reported um but yeah i mean that i would say in general that's probably the case you know it's 

374.53 387.35 B: it it's it's reported in such a way that yeah it does make it seem like these people like you know that they are guilty or so and so forth yeah like i definitely think of like martha stewart only having this 

387.67 391.61 A: yeah yeah yeah 

387.86 390.96 B: part of the conversation [laughter] um 

392.03 394.83 B: so i i think a lot of it just depends on how 

395.12 396.41 B: you interpret 

397.12 404.01 B: what's been presented but unfortunately the way that it is [laughter] presented is in such a way that that um 

404.66 405.42 B: (( you know )) 

406.31 407.26 A: mhm 

406.59 412.50 B: guilty or [laughter] guilty until proven innocent in some cases 

410.18 417.37 A: that's right that's right and um but i have been thinking a lot about it lately um 

417.45 424.02 A: there is another aspect to corporate ethics that m- there are lots of multinational companies 

424.08 430.24 A: uh which are like which have headquarters in u._s. and they work um 

430.22 439.35 A: in many parts of the world but the level of ethics or the standards of ethics that are observed here in u._s. are not observed elsewhere in the world 

439.40 441.17 B: that's true and it's difficult 

439.45 443.29 A: so there's kind of a dichotomy um 

443.53 451.94 A: and i don't know there i i i always feel that there is a very strong need to be consistent across the board when it comes to 

452.09 453.89 A: uh following the ethics 

454.50 455.70 B: right 

455.15 458.46 A: like many drug companies and um 

458.93 462.12 A: mining companies and i don't know there are 

462.34 467.59 A: so many unethical practices going on all around the world where the rules are not as 

467.98 471.78 A: strict and enforcement is not as effective 

472.23 473.43 B: right 

472.89 474.35 A: and 

474.55 475.61 B: right 

475.06 479.11 A: lots of things happening by those same companies which are 

479.24 484.38 A: doing really we- really well here locally in the united states but not elsewhere 

484.70 494.00 B: right although you know there's definitely been pressure on companies you know like nike and and uh the sweatshop 

493.19 495.43 A: mhm 

494.33 502.91 B: type thing and um i think to a certain extent you know that that's again you know somebody kind of taking up a cause i mean 

503.53 508.89 B: you know if if like the student groups didn't really run with that and really make it into an issue 

506.85 507.81 A: yeah 

507.88 509.49 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

509.16 510.40 B: you know maybe 

510.57 511.96 B: it would still be 

512.01 514.17 B: business as usual for them 

514.24 515.28 B: um 

516.24 518.92 B: but i think especially in the in the case 

518.96 520.23 B: of um 

520.83 525.98 B: you know multinational companies you do in in order for 

526.32 538.63 B: have corruption like that for i don't even know if that's corrupt uh when i say corrupt it's things that just are not not um acceptable business practices 

538.72 545.35 B: um i think you do kind of and you can't rely on the government especially 

545.50 546.94 B: internationally 

545.88 548.68 A: (( mhm right )) 

546.96 548.79 B: um 

548.84 555.02 B: at least a hundred percent you know it definitely think we need some help i think from uh 

555.74 558.71 B: other people that are kinda looking out 

560.10 569.87 A: right right they i i i think corporate um the e- ethics were all in the big picture on uh i- if you look at the corporate sector 

569.94 580.91 A: it basically starts with an individual in the first place and then it goes way up like in in the form of an organization so um 

581.11 583.26 A: everybody needs to realize 

583.31 591.38 A: their own set of responsibilities and then their responsibilities in connection to the other people 

591.42 599.89 A: and if everybody tries to follow the set of ethics which they are supposed to and ensure that others are doing the same
