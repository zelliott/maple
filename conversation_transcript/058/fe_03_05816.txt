210.89 213.25 A: yeah definitely 

212.30 223.00 B: [mn] and ah it's and thank god for people like him um there needs to be more people like that i think that business needs to be held really accountable 

218.95 220.59 A: oh yeah 

222.68 224.78 A: mhm 

223.72 235.42 B: and and what makes me angry is just this well we have to pay 'em the the high salaries to attract the best and the brightest i'm going yeah the best and the brightest screwed everybody over 

232.12 233.96 A: oh right 

234.98 236.35 A: exactly 

235.20 240.77 B: let's let's pay less money and get the mediocre maybe they'll do better [laughter] [laughter] 

238.55 243.06 A: yeah yeah and i mean and also i'm 

242.97 256.76 A: a little college student and i'm still somewhat a fan of south park i hate the show but sometimes their messages are funny what the ah one of the prof- ah teachers came up with this um vehicle like the segway i don't know if you've seen this one 

254.89 255.76 B: (( ahah )) 

256.58 263.03 B: oh yes the it ah the man the the teacher with the puppet yeah 

261.26 262.32 A: yes 

262.36 272.56 A: and j- and because he was sick of airlines and well we need a bail out from the government well you've given all your bail out money to the corporate executives you need to learn and it's just it's so right on 

272.34 277.14 B: ahah [laughter] ah that it actually south park has some great stuff [laughter] 

276.38 277.62 A: it does 

277.82 283.49 B: but it just and and i just feel frustrated 'cause i don't think washington's getting it so 

282.82 283.67 A: (( mm mm )) 

283.61 284.81 B: um 

285.56 291.75 B: i'm fairly disillusioned when i was in college i thought oh you know we can change the world but um 

287.38 289.09 A: oh yeah 

290.93 292.25 A: (( [mn] )) 

291.81 294.86 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

292.89 294.64 A: yeah 

295.15 300.47 B: it's ah so ah the enron and all that hasn't affected you personally 

300.12 302.95 A: not personally just sympathetically [mn] 

302.64 307.58 B: mhm yeah do you feel that there's anything that be done or is just big business 

308.23 315.09 B: is just has too much momentum and too much representation in washington that [mn] 

315.13 317.38 B: nothing's going to get ever done or mm mhm 

316.68 323.13 A: yeah i i kinda think it does but then i almost think that maybe this whole like [mn] you know maybe 

323.57 337.38 A: r._j. reynolds won't always hold sway maybe like gradually the lobby the lobbyists will change and ah but i just think it's something that we're that can't happen overnight and it is just so surreal with how 

337.45 338.01 A: (( [mn] )) 

337.94 352.54 A: everything compacting with september eleven and recession and just ah iraq and it none of it seems real or worthwhile and it just seems like we're living in a just a state of 

352.51 354.90 A: [mn] surrealism i don't know it's 

355.22 362.69 A: and i i didn't get to vote in the last election but i will [mn] next year and my god i want to make sure it counts it just 

363.06 365.05 A: oh it's frustrating 

364.13 373.08 B: mhm mhm you know it pleases me to hear young people saying that they're doing it because i think the last election proved every vote counts 

371.72 373.76 A: oh yeah 

373.32 380.81 B: i i don't think anybody can ever use the argument ah it's all you know electoral college and my vote doesn't count it does um 

380.18 381.64 A: oh yeah it does 

381.66 382.62 A: (( god )) 

382.40 386.85 B: i still think we're but [mn] that's my personal opinion [laughter] ah 

384.08 385.53 A: oh yeah so do i. 

385.96 391.83 A: i know and i mean um west michigan just a little history for you it's ah 

392.28 400.22 A: generally it was colonized by a lot of dutch we have a city named holland we have a city named zeeland and we're large f- 

396.71 397.67 B: (( [laughter] )) 

400.33 412.34 A: ah furniture manufacturers and it is rather conservative so when we have our you know gore for two thousand sign out in the front yard a couple of years ago we were the only ones in the area 

411.06 414.22 B: ooh [mn] you're brave [laughter] 

412.83 415.42 A: oh we yeah we are i mean my dad is a 

415.89 421.96 A: quite a democrat and a real union guy working with g._m. so it kind of goes hand in had but 

422.26 426.16 A: [mn] i mean we i was in government class we were documenting just you know 

425.98 435.59 A: the ah steps up to the election and then when it finally happened and we went for winter break and you know we were expecting you know who is the president but we still didn't at that time 

435.39 443.61 A: it was little crazy and it it just you know really brought home the teacher's point that see see you are a part of government 

443.67 447.74 B: ahah mhm [mn] yeah yeah well it's i've never worked for a big corporation but 

448.68 451.85 B: um you said your dad worked for g._m. but 

452.35 458.98 B: ah has he always [mn] does he feel that they deal fair does he feel that it's them against us or 

459.62 464.04 A: [mn] ah he's never had any real complaints he's in the skilled trades he um 

464.30 466.68 A: he's a millwright he doesn't necessarily build 

466.18 470.20 B: mhm he's a millwright wow that is a really impressive skill 

467.05 468.31 A: the cars 

469.66 472.79 A: okay so you do know what that is i never know how to describe it 

470.69 471.96 B: oh yes i do 

472.20 475.44 B: yes [laughter] i know exactly what he does yeah mhm yeah 

474.33 486.57 A: [mn] yeah so [mn] when there's um layoffs or strikes he generally gets to keep working and he's he's always been treated really well by both g._m. and his union so i've never heard much gripe from him 

487.60 489.25 B: it's just i don't know it's 

490.68 494.10 B: [mn] it would be really hard to deal with 

494.37 498.39 B: layoffs in the business like i said i'm just a small business person and 

497.81 499.66 A: oh yeah 

498.42 499.63 B: but um 

500.81 507.76 B: with big business i mean when you work for a big business you're so at the mercy of of the decisions at the top 

507.26 509.08 A: oh yeah 

507.87 520.74 B: and what irks me is that these people that are just like the skillings and all that um they have a responsibility to the workers i truly truly feel i mean yes they need to 

520.76 525.74 B: represent the shareholders but i think first and foremost you take care of your own 

525.18 527.14 A: mhm oh yeah 

526.50 532.49 B: and i think that's the worst crime they did 

532.40 542.22 B: and ah i just and what i like i said and i've seen smaller companies [mn] mimicking they've said well if enron can make fifteen percent profit per year we'll do it and 

542.70 544.98 B: (( you know we- we'll cook the books [laughter] )) 

544.23 545.43 A: (( mhm [mn] god )) 

545.84 547.57 B: do you see any 

547.58 548.72 B: (( ah )) 

549.26 554.83 B: thing in sight that's positive ah i mean ah you've you're taking classes in school and [mn] 

555.31 560.42 B: ah i don't know if you're taking any in politics or or business but um mhm 

560.95 562.83 A: not really but ah 

563.06 570.71 A: just i i see that ah well of course i really only hang out with other college students but there's a lot of us around here and 

570.86 572.63 A: it seems like we all 

572.74 575.43 A: we're we're divided but we're all 

576.00 582.62 A: agreeing on the idea that you know there needs to be a change and there's a lot of us around here at least that 

582.55 594.49 A: you know are taking the the politics and business classes and i think they are pretty bright and some of 'em might be a bit greedy but my friends at least i mean we we're probably 

594.72 597.19 A: too bright eyed but we think 

597.21 599.89 A: ah you know we can change something and we will and
