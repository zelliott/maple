57.10 58.50 B: um 

58.95 61.75 B: well all right i let's see i 

61.81 64.30 B: do do you have a have a large family or 

64.76 73.21 A: um well pretty large but they're mostly you know in like puerto rico or florida my of my family members live in new york 

73.05 74.91 B: oh you're in new york i see 

74.52 75.47 A: yeah 

75.19 76.32 B: um 

77.72 78.69 B: (( boy so )) 

77.95 79.97 A: (( how about you what does family )) 

78.82 91.98 B: ah yes i i well i i'm from philadelphia originally i'm in new york myself um and ah i have um i'm middle aged myself but my parents are still alive i have a brother as well 

83.37 83.95 A: (( mean )) 

91.57 92.47 A: mhm 

92.46 95.73 B: and he's in the philadelphia area um 

96.20 99.81 B: with his partner and ah 

100.46 112.26 B: so actually it's kind of a a strange situation in my family so since you're a s- stranger and we're supposed to talk i can tell you about it um but ah my my brother has cut off all communication from our parents 

112.40 113.47 A: all right 

112.55 120.01 B: they they had a they had a falling out and he hasn't talked with them in i can't tell you how many years so it's kind of a tricky situation 

120.51 121.67 A: all right 

121.16 122.36 B: um 

122.80 124.40 B: (( but ah )) 

124.71 132.96 B: you know i have to say in terms of what you know what family means um i'm also i'm a musician and i often work in theatre 

133.03 144.54 B: and when you're involved in a show whether you're on the road or in a tour or whether you're working in a production or whatever very often the people that you work with for the that period of time pretty much become your family 

144.90 147.38 B: especially if especially if you're travelling 

147.14 148.06 A: yeah 

147.98 157.47 B: um and it's it's rather amazing how how quickly that happens because everybody v- very quickly starts to depend on each other 

157.91 161.89 B: ah for various things in in the context of the job and and it's a 

162.23 166.16 B: this this kind of work is is pretty encompassing while you're doing it 

166.24 173.91 B: so it it becomes your little world your little cocoon and it's it's it's strange to have a you know 

174.19 180.49 B: a family for a period of time which can be you know a couple of years then all of a sudden the job's over and everyone disappears 

180.74 182.00 A: yeah 

181.17 185.04 B: a- and you know it starts all over again after that 

184.53 186.39 A: you do like broadway like 

185.65 187.25 B: i have yes sure 

187.10 187.91 A: yeah 

187.80 197.50 B: um that kind of feeling is is is more often when when you're on the road because you know you all have to travel together or you know you're always near each other 

197.37 198.69 A: yeah 

198.01 200.09 B: um there are people who 

200.35 206.03 B: carry their own actual families with them for example sometimes young ah young marrieds 

206.07 210.69 B: their spouse comes with them and if they have young children below the school age sometimes they'll 

210.88 212.79 B: actually drag them along too 

212.75 213.61 A: yeah 

212.87 221.28 B: so as they'll have an actual little nuclear families within the family and the kids sort of become everybody's kids and you know pretty amazing 

221.28 222.27 A: yeah 

221.86 222.99 B: um 

224.44 227.24 B: i'm trying to think what else i can say about family 

227.17 229.13 A: ah well something 

227.97 229.79 B: you you have any more ideas 

229.69 238.48 A: well like um it all depends like if family means a lot it depends like who you're with like i know some people coming out of single parent families some have both 

238.57 239.46 A: you know 

239.47 241.96 A: families are sometimes hard to 

242.36 250.99 A: to get along with each other like i know for instance i got like two half sisters that i've only seen like twice in my life um and i'm twenty four so 

248.56 249.58 B: wow 

250.63 251.53 B: uh-huh 

251.34 258.76 A: yeah so that's weird it's like um it it's not nec- necessarily that um families they're the people close to you 

258.60 268.94 A: i mean they are relatives of you but really just people who are close that you can trust just like um they're the ones you can count on when you're feeling alone or you have problems to deal with 

268.69 270.68 B: mhm 

269.24 270.00 A: (( so )) 

270.01 276.19 A: yeah 'cause there's one thing to be related and another thing to actually be closer and consider yourself a family member you know 

275.91 277.05 B: sure 

276.92 277.84 A: yeah 

277.08 282.86 B: have have you sort of built a family that isn't your blood family in some way 

283.01 291.21 A: oh yeah like um it depends like well at work i consider some people like are my family 'cause we share everything together you know 

291.33 300.35 A: and like we talk about things and you know we get along very well and sometimes you get closer to them more than your actual family members because maybe the distance or what have you 

294.25 295.90 B: mhm 

300.43 301.43 B: uh-huh 

301.24 302.45 A: yeah 

302.61 316.02 B: so and and that's not and i assume that's what what [laughter] excuse me for being in showbiz what you'll call a civilian job it's not like it's not like you're not really like living with them or or travelling with them or anything it's just just like your regular day job 

315.82 317.08 A: yeah 

316.73 319.89 B: and that still happens that's really neat 

318.71 319.98 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

320.40 321.57 B: what does that mean 

321.61 322.76 B: is that your phone 

322.57 325.51 A: (( oh yeah that's my phone [laughter] just don't worry about it )) 

323.36 327.71 B: okay that that's not the system okay 

326.15 327.18 A: yeah no 

327.55 328.46 A: yeah 

328.43 329.53 B: um 

328.75 329.48 A: but 

329.65 335.17 A: yeah that's cool because i've always wanted to be in showbusiness and see how it is but i never 

335.07 345.75 A: had the opportunity but i can imagine just like travelling like business musicians like when they travel they have a certain amount of um production with them and then they have to travel for tours and things so 

345.41 346.83 B: mhm 

346.25 351.98 A: those those people um you consider your family 'cause you're mostly close to them and you do everything with them 

351.77 354.57 B: right um 

352.62 353.89 A: yeah 

354.59 360.97 B: in fact sometimes the biggest problem is to get a little time off you know where you don't have to [laughter] interact with everybody 

360.73 362.12 A: (( yeah )) 

361.12 364.84 B: and it's like a it's like a fishbowl too i mean everybody knows everybody's business 

365.04 368.25 A: oh yeah true 'cause you're all close to each other and do everything you know 

367.78 375.76 B: yeah i mean even if even if you're not talking about it it's just like you know to to find a way to get off and have a little bit of life for yourself can be tricky 

375.72 376.78 A: yeah 

376.84 377.89 B: um 

378.75 379.32 B: (( [mn] )) 

379.54 380.42 A: oh 

380.15 380.71 B: (( [sigh] )) 

381.11 383.31 A: but i don't know like family is 

383.58 394.17 A: very much key to just for development you know like i think anybody's life goes for our family then you're on your own and you have no one to look forward to help you guide your way 

394.91 396.04 A: i think so 

396.35 397.13 A: (( you know )) 

396.83 400.78 B: right 

397.74 401.09 A: like especially and my my mother like she's helped me so much you know 

401.29 405.21 A: through my life and i've been anyway you know about her 

405.30 407.16 A: or just or my family 'cause 

407.19 409.23 A: they're there to help you whether you know 

409.78 412.41 A: you want them to or sometimes if you don't but 

411.97 421.84 B: [laughter] yeah right well you know mothers are like that they'll help whether you want them to or not 

413.52 414.53 A: so 

417.30 418.35 A: yeah 

418.59 419.99 A: (( yeah so )) 

420.02 422.33 A: i don't know [laughter] i i mean i wish 

422.38 428.83 A: maybe it could be like a more interesting subject because then you have more to talk too about but it's so general like you know we could say anything 

429.34 431.17 A: about families and stuff 

431.06 434.43 B: well i imagine the point is just to get people talking 

433.82 435.03 A: yeah 

434.66 437.58 B: i i don't think it's all that essential 

438.06 439.37 B: that you have to be 

439.57 443.81 B: sticking directly to the topic the point is just that there's not a lot of ssilence 

443.88 445.38 A: yeah that's true 

444.94 447.18 B: i'm hoping i'm hoping that's what it means 

447.14 448.29 A: yeah 

448.54 452.84 A: but it's yeah like and you know it all depends on your maybe 

452.92 466.23 A: ah families help you bring um help you learn about your culture and things in that nature that you might not know of because you live in like a different society or whatever like i know i live i come from a latin culture you know they i 

457.47 459.21 B: mhm 

462.07 463.76 B: right 

465.70 467.07 B: say that again please 

466.84 468.36 A: come from a latin culture 

468.44 469.89 A: (( so you know )) 

468.98 470.75 B: a lion coacher 

470.47 471.73 A: (( no latin latin )) 

470.95 472.40 B: l- latin culture 

472.12 478.36 A: yeah yeah [laughter] so they help me recognize my roots and things in that nature which i normally wouldn't learn 

478.38 480.12 A: being here in the united states you know 

479.77 481.82 B: so you you grew up in puerto rico 

481.64 486.18 A: oh no i grew up here but when i've learned the culture if it wasn't for my family teaching me you know 

482.51 483.36 B: oh 

485.88 487.70 B: mhm 

486.22 489.10 A: and recognizing that you know what what kind of um 

489.37 497.11 A: what my descendants um descendants had been through what the culture's all about and things in that nature you know so helping be awareness of that 

493.81 495.70 B: right 

497.04 506.68 B: oh yeah well that makes sense well i come from a jewish family and lord knows we had ah a lot of that kind of bringing up you know what what that's all supposed to mean 

503.89 504.85 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

507.96 511.09 A: so yeah i think i don't know family 

511.41 518.17 A: ah definitely is you know you really that type of nature is very pointy it even helps you in the long run you know throughout your life through 

517.93 519.79 B: mhm 

518.34 520.77 A: both your ups and downs and you know 

520.91 523.07 A: as a main part of your life basically 

522.87 524.83 B: right 

523.58 524.90 A: yeah 

525.03 525.86 A: so 

525.91 528.54 A: (( i don't i don't know if you want to ask [laughter] i don't know )) 

529.19 530.06 A: (( the )) 

529.51 530.23 B: w- 

530.48 535.52 B: well i'm i'm not sure either i gather you've talked on what it's a different topic every day 

535.04 544.99 A: um ah yeah well i had one or two topics one was on um [mn] i think it was about education and the other one was on um on um nine eleven 

545.30 549.14 B: oh i see so and we can only do three calls so this is your last one huh 

546.25 547.18 A: yeah 

548.82 560.31 A: yeah so yeah but i've i've like good experiences like sometimes you know it like one time i couldn't even finish it i i finished it but it was hard to finish it 'cause 

560.59 563.62 A: the second one was pretty good 'cause 

563.82 570.00 A: you had more to talk about and you wanted to talk more but it all depends i guess what the topic is and how you relate to it so 

569.86 571.78 B: right 

570.53 571.58 A: yeah 

572.22 576.47 A: but definitely like it's a good experience like i'm sure when you do the other two 

576.69 586.06 A: it'll be interesting hopefully 'cause you'll talk to somebody that you never really would not talk with normally wouldn't talk to on a regular basis and get their experience on whatever they feel 

586.68 588.96 B: (( right )) 

586.73 587.86 A: (( and so it's )) 

588.13 589.80 A: it's a learning and it's like 

590.06 591.55 A: it's about getting 

591.97 595.11 A: about you know getting different viewpoints that you never would really hear 

594.79 599.95 B: oh i guess so for me it's ah getting ten dollars no [laughter] i would like to have done that extra thing where but 

597.38 598.74 A: [laughter]
