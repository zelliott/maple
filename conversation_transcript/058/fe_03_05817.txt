1.41 3.19 B: (( hi my name's mark )) 

2.56 4.57 A: [noise] hi what's happening i'm roddy 

4.92 6.49 B: not too much 

6.47 11.04 A: so what did they say what do you think about corporate sc- the corporate scandals 

6.52 7.41 B: (( ah )) 

11.10 13.91 B: yeah i think the first question was ah 

14.10 18.73 B: do you think the government's doing enough to protect against corporate scandals and then yeah and then 

17.40 19.17 A: right 

18.84 23.14 B: just talk about the corporate scandals in general and go on from there 

21.01 25.36 A: yeah well what do you think you think they're doing enough 

26.89 33.27 B: um yeah well i just feel that ah the market will probably um correct itself 

32.83 34.19 A: (( [mn] [noise] yeah )) 

33.55 36.08 B: you know which it certainly has already 

35.44 36.63 A: yeah 

36.39 48.94 B: um i know i have friends who ah who do audit type work and they're they're totally they're saying you know everything's totally different now it's so much harder there are so many more ah hoops and hurdles that they have to pass through 

39.82 40.87 A: right 

43.58 44.52 A: yeah 

48.48 49.68 A: yeah 

49.04 52.99 B: you know with the v._p.s signing off on things what do you ah how about yourself 

52.47 64.81 A: ah yeah i think i think i pretty much agree with you i mean i think that ah it was a sort of a necessary wake up call for everyone else and i think everyone else is pr- [mn] you know it it scared a lot of people you know which i think is good 

64.82 76.76 A: and um i think as far as you know what they're doing is actually following through with you know charging some of the corporate people that were involved you know it's a good thing as far as you know being a scare tactic if nothing other than that 

76.89 77.71 A: (( you know )) 

77.86 88.83 B: [mn] oh definitely i mean [mn] just in [noise] the case of ah credit suisse first boston now they're going down and then you see the case of you know the martha stewart 

78.80 79.63 A: yeah 

82.77 83.80 A: yeah 

88.53 90.83 A: yeah exactly yup 

89.35 96.75 B: i._m. clone or ah whatever her ah the stock pick i mean that's all going that way it seems like 

91.32 92.15 A: (( yup )) 

93.72 94.64 A: yeah 

96.16 108.16 A: it's like a lot of these corporations and people it's like they sort of seemed like they were untouchable and now it's like well they're not so untouchable anymore so you know i think other people are thinking well neither are we w- we might want to watch our backs and you know clean up our act a little bit 

108.12 117.98 A: so and i think it's m- most of the corporations have gone back and looked through everything [laughter] it'll be like ar- are we next so i i think i think it's good yeah 

117.08 120.48 B: [mn] oh definitely um the only thing 

118.05 119.28 A: yeah 

120.65 122.39 B: that i wonder is you know 

123.28 126.33 B: history has a has a way of repeating itself 

125.85 127.12 A: yeah 

126.48 139.09 B: and that granted yeah this kind of thing the corruption occurred you know years ago and it's occurring now and i'm sure in you know another twenty years something else'll happen it's just the way the world works 

133.30 134.19 A: yeah 

137.23 138.10 A: yeah 

138.99 153.30 A: yeah i have a feeling that it's probably gonna wear off you know [laughter] it's like now we're just in the wake of everything and it's everything's cool but once the dust settles then i don't know five years down the road ten years down the road yeah i'm sure we're in for you know another round of the same thing 

153.50 155.03 A: yeah 

154.38 158.55 B: definitely it's just the nature of the beast but w- you know now with 

156.13 157.10 A: yeah 

158.79 163.84 B: less of these stock options that was a problem i think the way in which executives get paid [noise] 

160.51 161.51 A: yeah 

163.36 164.50 A: right 

163.86 167.03 B: you know an- and that really hasn't changed much 

167.16 172.41 B: and until that does you know i i can definitely see this occurring again and again 

171.24 172.14 A: yeah 

172.29 182.25 A: yeah and as far as a- as far as what they're [mn] doing to fix the scandals like do you think they're going about it in the right way like do you think it's enough 

182.33 185.53 A: like to just like take some of the big people to court and you know 

185.63 186.68 A: [mn] i mean 

185.96 190.58 B: [mn] [mn] oh i think definitely it's like the same thing with ah the i._r._s. ah 

190.81 192.07 B: (( you know ah )) 

192.39 202.82 B: going after willie nelson you know you go after someone really famous who screwed up and maybe what they did wasn't so serious but yeah [noise] tha- they have um 

194.06 195.06 A: (( yeah right )) 

195.98 197.39 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

197.60 198.47 A: (( yup )) 

202.97 207.03 B: [mn] you know they have those problems and and so by doing that yeah they 

204.44 205.23 A: yeah 

207.05 213.57 B: they definitely have a scapegoat and they someone that everyone can see and is visible so i think it's a great idea 

208.73 209.65 A: yeah 

211.40 212.26 A: yeah 

212.61 226.20 A: yeah and it shows them that they're not screwing around and i i i think it's good too as 'cause as you said i mean i think it's helped them market to sort of you know jump back up a little bit because now that they you know see that you know they're taking it seriously 

226.01 235.38 A: and they're cleaning everything up i think people are a little bit more confident whereas you know initially they were wary of everyone for you know sort of faulty accounting and now i think that the 

235.24 247.02 A: the the general public has a little bit more confidence you know in you know corporations so ah i think it's had a positive effect and i don't know i think it's gonna keep going for at least a the near future [noise] so 

246.43 254.19 B: [noise] yeah i totally agree i mean you look in the papers now and [mn] you know the the recession's officially over you know or it was over a couple of quarters ago 

253.68 254.80 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

254.21 257.37 B: but of course it still hasn't affected the job market at all 

256.72 265.61 A: yeah exactly right yo- you turn to one channel you know and they say [noise] like you know are we still in the recession are we in for another recession the next one's like the recession is long gone so 

265.44 266.54 B: yeah 

265.62 272.67 A: ah i'm no- i'm not really sold on the concept of a recession to begin with i think it's a matter of opinion sort of [mn] but 

272.85 287.06 B: o- oh entirely [noise] and ah and as more of these things get settled these lawsuits ah it's just gonna continue to help the market out i think afterward you know there's definitely a market correction period that went on but now it seems like it's over [mn] 

280.54 281.75 A: yeah 

284.06 285.07 A: yeah 

286.78 289.89 A: yeah yeah at least it at least it's on the way 

289.83 294.97 B: ye- yeah at lea- yeah until the next round until the next batch comes along 

292.48 293.50 A: yeah 

293.56 294.45 A: yeah 

294.39 301.56 A: exactly but i mean i i think it's good that you know [mn] the government actually stepped up and did something about it 

301.48 309.64 A: rather than just sort of sat on their ass and you know let you know just sort of like gave people a slap on the wrist [noise] you know i think when you threaten to throw people in jail it's a different story 

309.52 310.45 B: [laughter] 

309.71 316.63 A: you know an- and it shakes people up a little bit because you know to to take some sort of monetary action is you know 

316.65 320.32 A: in some of these situations is somewhat [mn] paltry you know 

320.57 321.75 A: but 

321.10 335.67 B: [mn] oh definitely um i i feel that that's that's great it's brought a lot of ah [mn] people now want to take those kind of classes in college ah you know they- they're going after th- you know people think ah it's almost exciting 

330.47 331.83 A: yeah true 

335.27 336.22 A: yeah 

335.58 341.88 B: to deal with the s._e._c. now i don't know i mean obviously it's not but [laughter] it's still ah 

339.85 340.89 A: yeah 

342.10 345.06 B: it's you know at least it's coming to the forefront now 

344.58 345.76 A: yeah 

345.57 347.65 B: which is vital um 

346.94 347.77 A: true 

348.10 348.98 B: [mn] 

349.16 350.33 B: (( the ah )) 

352.15 354.74 B: ho- has it affected ah where you live 

355.05 356.21 B: as much 

355.58 359.31 A: ah you know not really so much um 

357.79 359.20 B: not local 

360.38 368.69 A: [mn] no it hasn't really hit home for me at all you know it's like i i i pretty much just see it on the news i mean my girlfriend works um with a stock trading firm 

368.59 377.66 A: and so like yeah i mean [mn] i guess it's affected them you know a a little bit but she just started working there a couple months of ago you know after everything sort of ah 

377.06 378.92 B: oh so she's just yeah 

377.63 384.96 A: had passed so she sort of came in the aftermath you know i'm sure that it would've been a different story had she have been there during you know the thick of things 

385.15 386.34 A: but 

385.32 390.19 B: [mn] that's funny i i work with ah mutual funds and basically um 

388.10 389.24 A: yeah 

390.85 393.88 B: i work with a lot of administration and the auditors 

393.37 394.20 A: oh 

393.92 400.73 B: so i s- i've really witnessed a difference on behalf of the auditors you know now all of a sudden they're taking 

397.10 398.28 A: i'm sure 

400.76 406.95 B: you know semi annual periods as seriously as they take you know what they used to just take annually 

406.41 407.58 A: (( right [noise] )) 

406.96 414.95 B: and everything overall is a lot a little more stringent and it seems like they're getting a better quality of people who are getting into it involved with it so 

413.32 414.19 A: yeah 

414.31 415.48 A: yeah 

414.98 416.93 B: (( i think it's good )) 

415.93 422.33 A: yeah i mean as far as i'm concerned i think higher standards are better standards you know [laughter] i me- i mean 

422.65 423.68 A: i i c- 

423.59 429.51 A: i don't really know enough to say whether you know it was the standards that were so lax that sort of allowed for you know 

429.42 432.60 A: such actions you know to have taken place 

432.44 438.36 A: but um i think whether that was the case or not they've you know corrected maybe over corrected for it but 

432.52 433.65 B: (( oh right )) 

438.19 449.61 A: you know [mn] i- i- it sort of takes it takes you know something big to happen in order to wake people up and be like oh there's a hole in the system here you know [laughter] that that really really shouldn't be there so 

450.18 453.57 B: yeah i mean ah you know a lot of it it was induced by 

453.81 460.15 B: [mn] the market itself and you know and especially with all these options you know these 

458.97 459.83 A: yeah 

460.27 467.41 B: [mn] being able to you know that [mn] compensation of these high level executives are all tied into everything else 

467.11 468.06 A: yeah 

467.42 476.19 B: you know and i think now that you know they start taxing options using that black scholes method it's gonna really change things up 

473.51 474.35 A: mhm 

475.57 477.27 A: yeah 

478.29 481.11 B: (( [mn] um do you have any ah [noise] )) 

481.75 484.18 B: so it's just your girlfriend who is involved with 

484.17 485.22 A: (( yup )) 

484.62 486.71 B: with that kind of thing 

485.75 492.64 A: yup as far as me like ah i i in- i invest but you know i'm i'm not really directly involved with all that stuff and 

492.03 493.20 B: right 

492.63 502.48 A: i'm i'm not ah i keep up with what's going on on the news but [mn] i don't i don't i don't really dwell on it i i catch the headlines every now and again you know al- all i pretty much see these days are 

502.37 515.17 A: are m- martha stewart you know [laughter] or something like that but i see that you know they've gone international i know that dutch company ahold had some problems and ah so i think it's spread beyond the u._s. too so 

504.08 505.43 B: yeah 

514.74 518.14 B: oh that'll be interesting to see the effect on the multinationals too 

515.95 516.79 A: yeah 

517.35 522.20 A: yeah so i don't know what's going to happen i i read some some blip on the internet the other day 

522.08 533.27 A: about ahold and [mn] it was like you know after everything had settled a little bit and they were ah actually going after the executive or a couple of executives or something like that so [mn] i don't know i think that um 

533.40 539.42 A: i think that not only did it wake us up but or you know or open our eyes but you know to the rest of the world especially europe 

539.48 540.46 A: so 

540.08 545.35 B: no kidding i didn't realize that i didn't hear about that before wow that's interesting ah 

540.77 541.55 A: yeah 

542.87 543.96 A: yeah 

544.39 555.13 A: yeah it was it was in the news maybe three months ago and it was like sort of big but because it's europe it's still not that big here you know it's this dutch company who runs a bunch of supermarkets and ah 

555.12 568.44 A: i don't know what they had some of accounting issues and they were [mn] i don't re- i don't know th- technically exactly what happened and i guess it sort of went to court and now they're going after a couple of the sim- similar to what they did here going after the people that were in change you know 

568.60 574.71 B: yeah well hopefully they'll clean them up there too and at least ah get us on a good path at least for a while 

571.02 572.11 A: yeah 

574.11 579.20 A: yeah until someone else finds some other way to sp- just to skirt things you know 

579.19 584.43 B: yeah right [lipsmack] but the govern- the government's definitely doing their job though 

584.06 586.88 A: yeah yeah 

584.41 597.60 B: i i think i think they're definitely holding their end of things up um well with the turnover at the s._e._c. though i'm kind of you know wondering exactly what's what's going on there but i think they [mn] what's his name harvey 

587.21 588.48 A: yeah 

590.96 592.12 A: yeah 

594.44 595.64 A: yeah 

597.70 599.27 A: i think you're right yeah 

597.91 599.89 B: um or something like that he i thought he was
