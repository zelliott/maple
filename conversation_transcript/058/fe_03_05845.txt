144.06 153.41 B: right and then when you went off to your individual tents which are normally you fitted two then basically yeah it was just the warm sleeping bag 

149.10 150.13 A: yeah 

152.40 153.62 A: yeah yeah 

153.60 165.32 B: um but by the time you got to bed it was time to get up anyway so so you and you moved around most of the time but but winter activities are great especially outdoor

166.21 168.43 A: one year um [lipsmack] 

169.53 174.14 A: oh i think it was my senior or junior year in high school way back when 

174.13 186.71 A: i had um missed a bunch of my physical i hadn't f- fulfilled my requirements because i was skipping gym so there was a four day hike which i could do over the weekend and make up for those credits

184.83 185.95 B: oh 

186.35 187.46 B: okay 

186.70 200.05 A: and this was in the spring but it was a really bad year i live in the north east and um there was still about four or five feet of snow on the ground but it had hardened and so we were ended up 

191.57 192.77 B: okay 

196.04 198.90 B: oh okay [lipsmack] oh 

200.31 201.56 B: okay 

200.80 212.87 A: um and it was the one of the most strenuous hikes i have ever done because you know cause you take three or four steps and you're down so it's like three or four steps and then do a push up three or four steps do a push up 

204.30 205.98 B: oh i'm sure 

206.75 208.86 B: and you're straight to ground 

210.43 212.08 B: right 

212.66 214.18 B: oh okay 

212.82 225.15 A: [laughter] and there were more fallen trees than in the other year too so this was an an amazing e- amazing experience so it was supposed to be a warm weather thing but we were up to our waist in snow the whole time 

216.13 217.52 B: (( hmm )) 

221.56 223.51 B: mhm 

225.27 237.17 B: none of us now i know in the winter is i normally walk a lot when it snows [mn] cause i know my mom lives about five miles from where i live so i'll walk to her house 

229.80 230.99 A: yeah

243.27 244.49 A: (( oh okay )) 

247.59 256.34 B: i'm i'm i'm destined for a warm climate yeah eventually yeah i wouldn't e- i wouldn't mind living near a coral reef 

250.46 252.35 A: oh you are you're gonna move [laughter] 

253.19 254.01 A: yeah 

255.81 257.33 A: [laughter] 

256.75 259.38 B: or maybe hawaii

266.74 270.85 B: okay s- so i've never been to hawaii and i never been to key west 

269.78 272.43 A: i highly recommend the island of kway 

272.13 277.01 B: the island of kway okay now is that real expensive 

273.63 274.76 A: yeah 

276.45 284.20 A: oh gee i you know i was ten years old so i was oblivious to things i think it's probably not that expensive except for the plane ticket 

278.50 282.26 B: okay right right [laughter] 

282.53 283.78 B: right 

283.90 291.10 B: right cause most people say oh hawaii's so expensive i'm like well i'm sure they got little black towns that you know what i mean 

289.99 296.46 A: oh absolutely no uh uh we spent almost no time on hawaii itself we went out to one of the small islands 

294.06 301.84 B: right oh okay yeah so [laughter] i'm really looking forward to that in the next ten years or so 

296.66 298.07 A: yeah absolutely 

301.25 303.86 A: oh yeah definitely definitely go to kway 

303.27 311.81 B: relocating cause i'm kinda finishing up the modeling thing where i'm not modeling as much as i used to

322.63 323.80 A: oh cool 

323.51 332.73 B: and then being a fitness instructor um i w- i would prefer to move to a warm climate area where i could you know do fitness 

332.85 341.43 B: whether it be in the ocean out on out in the on the beach on the sand or or just in that having that warm climate weather 

337.22 338.19 A: yeah

345.54 347.25 B: with fitness 

345.88 348.80 A: being fit and our population's aging so 

347.96 350.97 B: (( [laughter] right ))
