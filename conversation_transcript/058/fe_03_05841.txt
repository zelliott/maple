0.04 1.31 A: hi 

1.20 3.66 B: hi there how you doing i'm jeff and you are 

3.28 6.43 A: i'm denny i'm uh on the big island in hawaii 

6.60 7.62 B: oh wow 

7.57 8.60 A: where are you 

7.77 9.20 B: i'm in new york 

8.80 11.82 A: oh wow two totally different opposites 

11.69 14.58 B: yes indeed [laughter] 

12.85 14.11 A: (( so at )) 

14.12 21.60 A: um well you know what my wife got this this topic earlier today and uh she was talking about it and 

21.71 28.52 A: she was telling me she didn't have much to say about it because i don't either [laughter] there's not much i know about that corporate world 

25.77 27.04 B: [noise] [laughter] 

28.50 29.49 B: uh 

29.01 30.63 A: um what i do 

30.67 33.01 B: what do you do for a living 

31.61 33.15 A: i'm a carpenter 

33.04 34.04 B: okay 

33.54 43.35 A: and uh there hasn't really affected me at all um i mean i listen to it on the radio what's happened i don't get any of the news off the t._v. we don't watch t._v. but um 

43.33 47.40 B: do you have any investments [noise] in the stock market at all 

43.95 45.11 A: from what 

46.37 52.52 A: no i don't have any investments in the stock market so w- why don't you enlighten me and i'll 

49.42 50.50 B: okay 

52.86 54.09 A: i'll let you know 

52.92 57.64 B: all right uh my background's actually is accounting [laughter] 

56.90 58.56 A: oh no kidding okay 

57.82 67.48 B: yeah so uh it's interesting to hear about this because uh the accounting field is taking a quite a quite a shake up also the you know what uh 

67.38 76.58 B: just how independent or accountants and how much are they beholden to their corporate masters and you know it can 

76.61 88.45 B: be the ones who are providing the oversight of all these corporations and making sure people are being honest and not cooking the books and not doing all sorts of machinations to 

87.05 90.64 A: yeah that that part i understand i mean yeah that's uh 

89.03 91.24 B: so like i 

91.09 110.15 B: so th- there's been a lot of scrutiny in that industry and also just from you know for myself in an investment perspective and i feel that the market has really you know taken quite a shake up because th- the confidence isn't there anymore that people are are afraid of you know what company is going to be the next one to be exposed 

109.67 110.56 A: right 

110.15 120.42 B: as uh as a big scandal and you know just like everyone lost their fortunes in worldcom and enron then tyco and all these other companies that you know who you know no one 

121.71 125.84 B: i think that's keeping the uh the big rallies from taking off again 

125.51 127.16 A: mhm 

126.73 141.68 B: and i said so uh i think you might even feel that even you know even in carpentry like even where you're at i don't know how like your your business is affected you know as people feel less wealthy they're they're gonna want less furniture and they're gonna wanna [sigh] you know 

141.67 151.72 B: ha- be spending less in general uh have you noticed yourself in your industry that you know say versus five years ago that demand has fallen off at all 

151.67 155.87 A: um being on the big island all i can see is it's uh 

154.87 157.33 B: i don't know if hawaii's [laughter] like that 

156.49 158.72 A: it's the one with the volcano 

157.42 160.66 B: (( actually yeah yeah )) 

158.96 163.68 A: and um this island is just growing like crazy um 

164.03 166.84 A: uh i i mean everywhere you turn there's 

166.75 178.22 A: it went from probably a million dollar cap on houses to probably i doubt whatever you can imagine i mean the house i just went and worked on today we had to do some 

178.01 185.13 A: some things on it it's just uh unbelievable what they're doing to to these houses over here um 

185.23 190.24 A: it seems uh the land is cheap over here for people to come over here and and actually buy 

190.43 194.59 A: so maybe that's uh a good thing for 

192.41 193.87 B: (( well )) 

195.00 197.73 A: for people in that corporate world i don't know 

195.05 196.53 B: that's interesting 

198.02 205.07 B: that that really could be an interesting side effect that people are now coming over there in you know in search of uh 

205.41 210.51 B: maybe cheaper land and stuff you guys actually benefited from uh 

206.88 209.31 A: cheaper land and gorgeous 

211.32 216.80 B: from um these scandals you could say maybe i if it's attributed to the scandals of course 

214.51 216.19 A: yeah 

216.52 218.36 A: could be who knows you know 

219.18 222.67 B: what an interesting turn of events [laughter] 

220.88 223.73 A: yeah [laughter] 

224.05 227.54 A: but um be- being held accountable i mean um 

224.17 225.01 B: (( [noise] )) 

228.52 232.12 A: i i don't see why they should be any 

232.39 237.51 A: any different than any other you know crooked person you know you break the law you break the law 

237.60 240.79 B: mhm i definitely think they should be held accountable i mean 

241.20 250.44 B: and but i think they need to use specific laws for people who are involved in such mass large scale 

250.65 259.26 B: type of activities because it's not like a simple crook someone who you know stole like something from uh from your neighborhood grocery store 

258.75 259.54 A: no 

259.32 263.25 B: we're talking about people like who have really had uh 

262.30 263.90 A: just millions mhm 

263.25 268.59 B: huge not just not just millions cause it's you know it's one thing and you could say that you embezzled 

268.38 279.34 B: from like your employer and you did it in the millions now you're just as the number of people that you affected like it's not just like millions of dollars or billions of dollars it's millions of people 

273.95 275.04 A: that's true 

279.60 287.55 B: and y- you know it's like you're going it's the difference between someone who's you know gonna go out on an individual murder and someone who's you know 

288.01 292.45 B: gonna be blowing themselves up in the middle of a oklahoma city [laughter] 

292.15 293.56 A: no kidding 

293.28 296.19 B: and i- cause it's hard to compare someone who's 

295.96 299.30 B: you know victimizing one person 

299.11 310.63 B: and while they're both criminals i think the penalties need to be a lot stiffer the to be the fear needs to be instilled a lot greater cause a lot of these guys are are getting a s- you know what they're sort of getting 

310.51 314.33 B: fined or whatever they're getting but they're still living in the lap of luxury 

314.34 315.56 B: (( th- )) 

315.57 323.39 B: y- they they've in a sense they did their crime and they haven't done any time for it and so that that aspect of fear 

320.23 321.10 A: yeah 

323.44 330.99 B: of the government fear of repercussion h- hasn't come down and i don't think people are feeling that particularly 

328.24 332.36 A: well do you think people have no you think these people have a lot of power 

332.72 337.85 B: um i think they have power and i think that 

338.15 343.04 B: i don't think that maybe uh the government anticipated what 

343.59 355.01 B: the ma- the magnitude of what could happen or cause i don't think [noise] scandals like this really occurred previously i don't think that i i mean they have occurred i i correct myself but [noise] 

356.16 363.40 B: i think the government grew complacent in feeling that uh safeguards that we had were sufficiently in 

363.38 364.63 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

363.97 371.82 B: place and i think also and let's keep in mind that our political system runs on the big bucks of these owners 

371.55 372.73 A: (( oh yeah )) 

372.19 377.43 B: so no one really wants to go and shake them up and make them too unhappy 

377.93 379.05 A: that's true 

380.24 382.21 B: so it's uh 

382.71 386.19 B: i- i think i think the scandals really are 

386.34 397.95 B: you know are affect all levels of society and the whole political echelons of society are so indebted to to these dollars that uh 

398.58 405.02 B: that the ordinary people get totally locked out of the process and 

402.97 403.76 A: (( yeah )) 

405.26 410.50 B: you know a- are made to you know bear the brunt on their retirement plans and stuff 

411.47 413.76 A: yeah i guess when i get more into uh 

415.93 422.11 A: investing in stocks and that sort of thing i'll probably pay more attention to what's going on 

422.16 426.69 B: how old are you denny yeah oh okay 

422.74 423.46 A: how 

423.47 424.60 A: old am i 

424.67 425.93 A: thirty four 

426.68 429.18 A: yeah i just never 

429.45 430.93 A: have gotten 

431.03 432.69 A: that involved in 

433.47 435.51 A: in that that world 

434.32 435.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

435.35 440.11 B: well in a sense uh you know over the last couple of years you made the right decision [laughter] 

439.63 440.83 A: yeah 

441.41 443.43 B: a lot of people got wiped out 

443.30 444.27 A: yeah 

445.99 454.38 A: i only know about you know what i heard on the radio about enron and and that's the only one i know there's another one that got that got brought down 

454.91 458.65 A: and and i can't think of it off the top yeah that's the one worldcom 

455.84 457.03 B: worldcom 

458.66 461.91 B: there's tyco also and 

459.16 460.11 A: and 

460.95 462.56 A: oh there's a few of them now 

462.21 464.35 B: yeah 

463.21 465.07 A: oh throw 'em all in jail 

464.47 465.87 B: [noise] [laughter] 

465.24 471.33 A: for a long time i mean you can't really what can you do you can't you can't give them capital punishment a 

471.40 472.21 B: no 

471.62 473.77 A: lot of people don't believe in that 

473.17 485.79 B: but true i know i don't think that that would be necessarily appropriate anyway because it certainly doesn't fit the uh the crime or the nature of the crime but number one i think you can 

485.78 491.62 B: you know very heavily penalize them financially and two and put them you can put them in 

488.75 490.11 A: oh yeah 

491.49 501.77 B: you can definitely give them i think jail time that not in m- not in that but not in the cushy little country club jail they should be in you know a maximum security prison that's where they should 

495.26 496.88 A: aren't they getting jail time 

499.07 500.60 A: oh is there oh they're in 

501.50 503.37 A: yeah 

504.07 506.47 A: like sing sing or something or 

504.33 505.05 B: (( be )) 

505.40 516.81 B: [sigh] or i'm not even sure like i- i- it's got to be something that's scary because because the fact is you know sitting around in their cushy country club jail is not necessarily uh a deterrent for people 

516.48 517.22 A: no 

516.79 523.25 B: i- you know it's gotta be and it's gotta be something that that really fits the magnitude of the crime 

523.44 530.08 B: of the the fact that you know you've affected the lives of millions of people you know i say yes turn them o- you know turn them loose and they 

530.33 531.04 B: (( cause )) 

531.12 535.83 B: make them do commu- like less massive community service something for them to you know 

536.45 540.28 B: fifty hours a week of community service seventy hours a week of community service that would make them be h- 

540.46 548.26 B: you know indebted to the society that they've um you know wrecked already 

547.28 549.11 A: so work off what they stole 

548.98 557.88 B: mhm yeah essentially i think that's much more of a a fitting punishment because the locks them up in jail what what have you accomplished first of all i think you know jail should be 

557.89 567.14 B: for those who are you know violent or need to be off the streets etc it doesn't i don't think it necessarily serves a purpose to you know lock up non violent people in jail 

561.40 562.45 A: mhm 

568.86 569.91 B: um 

570.91 583.37 B: y- you gotta do i think i certainly think that it's gotta be something you know fitting and something that where th- they're tr- at least somewhat making amends to those who they've damaged 

583.14 586.14 A: yeah now were you affected ha- 

586.57 588.63 A: you know quite a bit by those or 

586.81 587.77 B: um 

588.30 599.89 B: i mean i definitely was affected by the by um the fall of the stock market um but i think overall as an economy i lived in new york so we like our economy 

594.11 595.14 A: yeah
