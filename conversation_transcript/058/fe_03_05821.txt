23.89 30.50 B: yes it's quite a nice city um so so ah so the question 

30.57 33.98 B: um how do you think the government should curb ah 

34.02 36.41 B: illegal business activity 

36.88 38.86 A: [noise] well yeah i mean 

38.96 44.81 A: illegal business activity kind of just by the nature of being illegal should be curbed i think 

44.27 46.00 B: yeah 

44.95 49.05 A: um i guess it kind of depends on on what we're talking about 

49.01 54.63 B: right right i think ah i don't know um personally i was i was just thinking that ah 

55.48 61.67 B: probably the best way to curb illegal activity would be to to loosen the ties between the government and business 

61.71 75.80 B: since they're so strong especially you know the oil industry and what not and a lot of the other businesses that that go on they can get away with it being illegal because they've got such close ties to the government that the government kind of turns it head in order to get 

65.63 66.56 A: right 

75.63 78.16 B: campaign money and what not you know 

77.68 78.67 A: right 

78.30 78.86 B: (( [mn] )) 

79.01 83.52 A: oh and not to the mention the fact that so many people who are involved in kind of higher 

84.59 86.56 B: yeah yeah 

86.42 87.53 A: [noise]

93.44 95.10 B: yeah yeah that's fine 

94.41 95.11 A: (( okay )) 

95.57 101.29 A: yeah um i i think that you know so many government officials are involved in in corporate business anyway 

101.07 101.97 B: (( mhm )) 

101.32 102.83 A: (( that ah [mn] )) 

102.76 113.22 A: you know that it's really easy for them to not only turn their head as far as like campaign finance goes and stuff like that but also just because it's their company you know like and obviously they're not gonna they're gonna 

111.09 112.20 B: right 

113.04 122.86 A: kind of rat out their own company or change things where they're making money and unfortunately that's what that's what corporate america has has come down to is just a huge money generating machine 

122.47 124.14 B: (( [noise] exactly )) 

123.57 128.25 A: you know i tend to be pretty anti corporation myself um 

124.17 124.97 B: just 

127.86 130.03 B: (( as do i as do i )) 

130.61 137.75 B: yeah ah i i don't know if ah i think the only people who are really pro corporation right now are the people who are ah 

137.96 151.47 B: you know pretty much involved in corporation because everybody else right now is is pretty much getting screwed over it's it's becoming corporations are are just are just making the rich richer and taking out the middle class you know 

141.66 142.52 A: right

192.16 206.23 B: with trying to find good jobs i have a couple of friends who worked extremely hard interviewing all year and they've got good jobs but everybody else i mean like probably about five ten years ago you could get out of school and probably and be like offered jobs

207.77 210.43 B: (( yeah ah )) 

209.69 218.94 A: yeah i- it's it's pretty amazing to me just because you know that's what that's what i always thought a a college education was going to do for me like you know i don't i don't really care about making you know 

218.93 231.36 A: slathers of money or anything like that like i- i- that's not a huge issue to me but it would be nice to have enough money to pay my bills and be able to go out with my friends and have a good time and stuff like that and not have to worry about you know like am i gonna be able to 

220.55 222.45 B: (( [laughter] yeah ))

234.72 236.19 B: exactly 

236.37 251.18 A: and that's unfortunately like the position that i've been stuck in for like a year and a half just constantly like having to watch the bank account constantly having to you know like even though i'm working like having to come home at night and look for new jobs just so i can try and make a little more than i am like 

251.02 258.05 B: yeah yeah that totally totally sucks i i ah have you been out for a year and a half out of college then 

257.99 259.15 A: yeah 

258.69 259.61 B: (( okay )) 

259.48 272.12 A: um and it it's just i moved up to ah portland for a while and and the economy's so bad up there like s- as far as you know business goes and stuff like that just because of all the dotcom stuff that crashed like 

272.11 278.95 A: you know a year or two ago and all those people instead of m- you know moving out of the state like just took all kind of the menial jobs 

273.19 275.06 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

278.70 279.72 B: ah 

279.10 288.42 A: so it's it's pretty tough to even get like a waiting position or like you know like a like i was i for the first like six months i was out of college i washed dishes for like six fifty an hour 

288.05 290.33 B: (( [sigh] that sucks [mn] ))

301.18 302.15 B: and 

301.43 302.24 A: (( yeah i- )) 

302.23 307.24 A: it makes it tough like because know i mean journalism an- and writing because i would love to be a writer 

307.08 308.50 B: yeah 

307.22 318.08 A: you know like i i love writing poetry i love short fiction and stuff like that and like but it's so hard to break into i mean you're gonna pay your dues for years before you're gonna you know land a book contract or something like that you know 

317.15 323.85 B: exactly you can't just like ah come out as a young buck and [mn] and make your name right out off the bat you know 

321.25 322.76 A: [laughter] 

323.71 328.79 A: yeah so you have to depend on like what options are available to you in the economy like 

329.04 336.46 A: you know and if if you want to be able to focus on writing or something like that like if you did come out of college with with some sort of english or journalism 

336.28 345.53 A: degree then you want to have time you don't want to you know put your entire life into a job like where you're working like you know like nine ten hours a day because then you don't have time to do 

345.51 346.51 B: what you 

345.70 347.19 A: what you're really trying to do 

346.89 352.82 B: exactly yeah i i'm sort of in the same the situation i've got a i've got a band out here 

352.74 364.41 B: and so i- it's always trying to you know work something where where you have time for that but you also have you also need to make money obviously because ah being in a band's not a a very 

352.83 353.67 A: okay 

361.49 362.46 A: right 

364.56 367.32 B: ah financially sound enterprise 

366.44 368.23 A: [noise] [laughter] yeah 

367.72 368.76 B: so 

368.63 378.58 A: yeah i had a band in california before i moved out to chicago and ah it was great but it just took up a lot of time and i eventually just quit working um i had saved up enough money to live for about two months and i just 

378.60 387.75 A: quit my job because i couldn't take it anymore and just played with the band and we'd make you know like forty fifty bucks a night playing just small venues and stuff and we'd just live off that 

387.18 391.88 B: yeah exactly that's that's pretty much how it is in philly too ah 

392.05 401.46 B: you can you know i- ah un- unless you're like a known act you can really only make like forty fifty bucks a night like at the at the small clubs around here 

399.24 400.17 A: yeah 

401.42 402.42 A: yeah 

402.06 406.83 B: but i don't know we we just started out here too we've been um 

407.18 418.12 B: two of the members ah me and another mem- member were actually in penn state so we we have like sort of a fan base there but now we're out in philadelphia and we h- we just have to like start over again 

414.39 414.95 A: (( [mn] )) 

418.10 418.66 A: (( [mn] )) 

418.28 424.70 B: and just like build up another like group of people to come out and listen to us you know and pay us money [laughter] 

423.93 425.01 A: yeah 

424.73 426.38 B: when they get the chance 

426.74 427.69 A: yeah 

427.35 429.13 B: (( yeah )) 

429.18 436.77 A: yeah it's tough i don't know i mean i was that's those are the two places i'd like to go are music and ah music and writing ah 

435.84 438.27 B: yeah yeah 

437.00 438.64 A: and you know they're 

438.80 447.18 A: they can be really rewarding i think an- and lucrative it's just you know it takes so long to it takes so long to do it you've got to be in the right place at the right time and 

446.94 448.22 B: exactly 

447.58 449.53 A: you've got to work really hard 

449.14 454.41 B: yeah i know and and just like basically just suffer [laughter] you know [mn] 

453.00 454.81 A: yeah yeah 

454.43 456.27 B: (( yeah )) 

455.32 460.00 A: yeah i- i- i just find it really unfortunately that like [mn] that um 

460.20 471.10 A: that our economy has been allowed to get to the point where it is because i think that it could be better like ah ah you know i'm not gonna blame it on the current administration like you know like entirely and say like you know it's george bush's fault that the 

470.86 472.13 B: right 

470.86 481.98 A: economy's bad but in a in a large to a large extent like it does reflect on you know like the priorities of of the current administration like with the 'cause they 

482.05 495.73 A: have seemed to put a lot more effort and way more money into you know like into overseas affairs and like you know there's some validity within those i think here and there like there's certain things that you know like we should be concerned about 

488.98 490.79 B: exactly 

495.68 503.64 A: but at the same time you know like it's our country and we have kids who can't read we have people with no jobs and it's growing like every day you know and 

495.70 496.57 B: but 

503.31 508.65 B: yeah and even even like i think the v- like any validity though of 

508.67 511.20 B: like that they have for for 

511.25 522.56 B: messing things up overseas is like i don't know i i think that all of that's taken away by the by the fact that that everything over there is oil run and they keep saying it's not but 

521.86 526.24 A: right no and i agree with that i'm say- eh other than validity i mean like 

526.19 536.30 A: like i don't agree with any of the reasons that we went to war in iraq like i think that it was trumped up like you know [mn] i think i don't know if it was ah like all the intelligent was dis- 

529.65 530.80 B: right 

536.18 543.53 A: intelligence was dishonest necessarily but i think that there was definitely media hype and hype from the government that um 

543.62 547.21 A: that caused people to be willing to jump the gun on things 

546.41 548.02 B: yeah definitely 

547.48 551.26 A: on the other hand i i do agree that that you know like [mn] 

551.09 565.22 A: dictators who who run their countries and and are terrible to their people like need to be stopped i think it can be done diplomatically i don't think that it need we need to rush in with the army whenever we feel like it but i you know i definitely think that 

561.69 562.94 B: right 

565.17 579.55 A: that as citizens not only of the united states but also like you know humans living with other people on a planet like we need to not necessarily only look out for ourselves i think that that we have kind of a moral responsibility to other people groups who are less fortunate 

579.73 581.18 B: exactly 

579.83 581.16 A: you know like 

581.18 588.72 A: [mn] in terms of like poverty and stuff like that um but i you know i don't think that means that we need to go press democracy on everyone but 

588.22 598.35 B: yeah i mean it- it's sort of with the bush administration has changed from whereas with clinton it was like we were the world protector we were the world police now we're sort of the world bully 

598.20 599.36 A: right 

598.62 599.95 B: you know i- it's
