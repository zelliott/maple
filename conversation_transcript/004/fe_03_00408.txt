9.65 11.42 A: my name is buddha 

11.26 12.20 B: buddha 

12.13 13.09 A: yes 

12.81 14.63 B: my name's michael how are you 

14.59 16.70 A: hi michael i'm good thank you 

16.77 24.52 A: ah well it's basically my first conversation on the phone like ah regarding this one is this the same for you 

20.89 22.11 B: likewise 

24.27 25.30 B: yes 

25.31 32.63 A: oh okay [laughter] [cough] well i guess we are supposed to talk about education but are you from philly or somewhere else 

30.44 31.16 B: yeah 

32.42 34.39 B: no i'm in south florida 

34.48 40.48 A: south florida oh this is pretty good oh i i'm in pennsylvania central pennsylvania 

35.61 36.46 B: mhm 

39.74 41.42 B: and how's the weather today 

41.71 44.83 A: oh god it's freezing outside it's unbelievable 

43.30 44.15 B: [laughter] 

44.73 47.77 B: yeah sorry to hear that i won't tell you what it was like here today 

47.91 50.21 A: [laughter] 

49.66 52.04 B: so how 'bout computers in education [noise] 

52.85 55.55 A: computers in education um 

55.78 66.52 A: well in fact i'm teaching ah in a university um i'm at i'm teaching an undergrad class and i'm using computer widely [noise] in my teaching 

66.73 76.23 A: um but like it's not like distance education that everything is on the computer i'm using it as a supplement to the main teaching 

72.13 73.08 B: mhm 

76.51 78.24 A: so um 

78.20 86.41 B: and and in in what are you using it ah is it for assignments or communications with the students or ah doing research or 

86.71 98.27 A: it's not doing research it's basically communicating with the students um so now i'm posting everything on the net we have a website ah related to the to the course that i'm teaching 

91.06 92.29 B: mhm 

98.28 102.08 A: and we have all the activities assignments 

102.17 104.97 A: guidelines for the projects or 

105.44 108.28 A: um even the schedule the syllabus 

108.83 114.95 A: and of course the email list they're all on the net um and students are supposed to 

111.89 112.80 B: mhm 

115.28 123.73 A: um check their mails and um look into this website like at least two times a week and get all the information 

123.88 137.05 A: and basically i'm using um computers and technology like ah in terms of the computers like kind of a tool ah in order to communicate with the students more um efficiently like more effectively 

137.21 138.30 A: um 

139.09 142.87 B: but b- but not so much like in the classroom right 

142.99 146.50 A: in the classroom no not really um 

145.58 146.86 B: mhm 

146.40 152.48 A: i mean w- we have like several computers labs and students are doing some kind of simulations 

152.37 165.90 A: by using some of the softwares but um basically they're kind of like they're supplementing they're not like really supplementing the class but are kind of helping us to understand the concepts better 

165.52 179.11 B: right right so but it sounds like primarily it's a communication tool just make it easier so that all the information that teachers have always had which is like you said the syllabus and the assignments and whatnot are available at any time 

179.09 184.88 A: yes exactly and even the grading um they post their assignments on the net and i just grade 

185.31 194.45 A: um while i'm sitting in my office and just um grade them on the net and they will get the they will learn the true internet too 

190.83 191.81 B: mhm 

194.43 204.79 A: so it's basically for ah communicating yes i mean we are not like creating artificial realities on the net and living there to be honest [laughter] 

199.98 200.84 B: right 

204.77 207.90 B: and i'm sorry you said that was undergrad college 

208.16 209.92 A: [cough] it's um 

209.93 216.27 A: undergr- no it's in a university level it's an undergrad class but i'm a graduate student 

212.88 213.82 B: (( right )) 

214.65 215.58 B: okay 

216.09 216.95 B: right 

217.33 222.98 A: so basically i mean i i i like computers as a tool of communication 

223.08 232.67 A: um but i am skeptical in the sense that it's always good for us to ah create some realities through the computers 

232.80 235.63 A: like i have some doubts about that 

232.87 233.76 B: right 

234.99 247.12 B: it's interesting i ah i read something the other day that said ah somebody had done a study of um you know bringing computers into the primarily i guess elementary up through high school level 

246.91 252.29 B: ah bringing them into the classroom and making available and didn't seem to have made a difference 

247.11 248.08 A: okay 

252.22 265.41 B: ah and the conclusion they drew was that was because um m- they the teachers you know the th- who really haven't grown up with it and the kids are more used to the technology and using the tool 

261.62 262.57 A: yes 

265.28 274.09 B: and the teachers haven't really been able to find a way to make it part of the day you know part of the education um it's 

273.49 274.82 A: (( hm )) 

274.19 282.77 B: it's an auxiliary right now you know it's ah like like you guys do it's a you know you do a lab or something it's not part of the education per se 

282.87 283.47 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

283.90 293.29 B: and ah i have a daughter who's just in high school and you know i remember in even when she was in elementary school and middle school they always had computer labs 

286.76 287.97 A: mhm 

293.35 294.27 A: yes 

293.37 307.13 B: um but you know they either they got an hour or a period a day or every couple of days or um you know they had exercises to do on the computers you know it wasn't ah it's not integrated into the the fabric of the curriculum 

307.43 310.37 A: mhm mhm mhm 

311.24 313.33 A: i see so um 

313.90 318.29 A: do you think she's enjoying um learning something on the computer 

318.40 330.99 B: she's ah she's quite adept with it yeah ah she does a lot of you know homework research ah she knows much like you guys have there's her some of her teachers post their stuff on the web 

330.85 343.91 B: you know there's sites that the high schools can use and they she gets homework help on the web and she can find her assignments and she co- certainly communicates with her classmates and email and instant messaging and 

331.09 331.93 A: mhm 

343.32 344.84 A: mhm mhm 

344.04 349.30 B: you know paper research and all kind of things yeah she's quite good at it 

347.43 348.48 A: mhm 

349.51 351.08 A: so um 

351.49 354.40 A: well this is pretty neat though but 

354.80 359.27 A: maybe i can ask you a question like do you think computers um 

359.68 363.34 A: are in general tools that we should always 

363.63 368.17 A: um considering using in any kind of human activity 

369.62 371.95 B: well i won't say any kind 

369.98 370.77 A: like 

372.52 382.77 A: in terms of like for instance teaching yeah let's just talk about teaching maybe it's better um like i i to be honest i can't a find a difference in terms of um 

372.68 373.95 B: you know there's 

383.06 388.48 A: um paper and pen like pencil and paper and the computer and keyboard 

388.50 390.27 B: mhm 

389.51 400.34 A: like i i think it's the same tool i mean if it's they are dissimilar tools but just one of them is technologically advanced when compared to other but um 

400.94 409.91 A: i mean it's just a tool i guess like the computers they're not like going to open up a new perspective and a better understanding of world or something 

409.93 411.23 A: because like 

411.50 413.83 A: [mn] paper and pen pencil and paper 

413.90 416.99 A: we know ah at least we use them in order to 

417.22 424.23 A: save our ideas thoughts by writing down the text and um maybe like um 

425.08 438.61 A: while reading some other's papers we we ah we somehow communicate with them through the paper and i think computers are the same ah in some manner but on the other hand um 

440.48 444.90 A: so basically like i'm not expecting too much things from the computers 

445.33 455.14 B: well like you said they're strictly a tool and um i'm in computers i find it interesting in that for the last ah you know twenty years or so 

451.81 452.72 A: mhm 

455.77 457.31 B: a lot of the 

457.32 463.67 B: a lot of people's time and exposure with the computer has been a fascination with the tool 

463.83 470.14 B: you know it's like people who buy cars not because they like to drive or to get from point a to b. 

469.00 471.01 A: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] okay )) 

469.94 482.41 B: but because they like to tinker with them you now they like to paint 'em and wax 'em and you know what i mean so same thing with computers we're still at a stage i think in um software development where 

475.31 476.68 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

482.34 496.47 B: for a lot of people it's the the tool is more interesting than what you can do with it and i [noise] i think once the computer itself sort of fades into the background and we we're able to 

496.72 500.36 B: [lipsmack] take the communications and the computing power 

500.56 510.66 B: you know literally for granted and and at every turn and have it you know at our fingertips without having to think about okay what program am i running and how do i do this 

510.57 511.82 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

510.92 521.21 B: you know where they really become ubiquitous and everybody's got all the bandwidth you need and and ah you know anywhere you're at you can communicate or or get access to computing power 

521.13 525.93 B: then i think a lot of things will open up you know because if 

524.32 528.04 A: mhm yeah yeah i do agree yeah 

526.02 526.86 B: (( you )) 

527.02 535.06 B: know look at look at pen and paper now they to carry on with what you were saying i'm sure that when you know when only rich people had paper 

535.24 537.37 B: because it was expensive to make 

535.42 538.17 A: yeah (( )) 

538.14 540.61 B: you know it was a fascinating thing 

540.50 542.04 A: mhm mhm 

541.46 545.78 B: um but look at it now i mean you know how many sheets of paper do you throw away a day 

546.12 549.98 A: [laughter] i don't know i don't count [laughter] 

546.97 547.90 B: you know 

549.09 559.42 B: and so [noise] you know when when computers get [noise] to that point um [noise] when you don't think about oh i'm using the computer or [noise] i have to go use the computer [noise] to do this 

559.33 560.42 A: mhm 

559.55 566.61 B: ah then i think things will they'll integrate [noise] and we'll be able to make a lot [noise] better use of 'em 

566.29 570.01 A: mhm mhm that's probably um 

567.90 570.04 B: [noise] shh 

570.20 571.30 B: [noise] 

570.61 575.48 A: so what about what about this idea do you think ah computers are 

575.74 579.82 A: um kind of promoting um 

575.97 576.91 B: [noise] 

580.31 585.17 A: the kind of the inequality within society 

585.25 588.98 B: [noise] [noise] well you mean like the 

585.96 587.46 A: like for instance 

587.73 588.83 A: some people 

588.95 590.23 A: have a 

589.10 591.75 B: computer haves and the computer have nots 

591.62 596.88 A: yes yes the people who who have access to computer and the ones who doesn't who don't 

592.84 593.78 B: um 

596.88 599.04 B: certainly it been true 

599.24 599.89 B: you know
