257.02 258.25 A: i can't believe i got called already 

258.55 259.36 B: yeah 

259.55 260.54 A: um goodness 

261.40 264.52 A: the other one watching the uh enron movie 

264.03 266.60 B: oh yeah you know that's that's not good 

265.74 267.04 A: i don't know that much 

277.66 278.17 B: um 

278.25 282.68 B: have to uh keep the options i guess as uh 

282.79 293.35 B: uh write them on the books instead of have them off the book so that investors know just how much the company gives to these executives then people might not buy that stock 

288.41 289.09 A: right 

291.88 293.72 A: okay that's not okay that's not 

293.99 294.51 B: yeah 

294.05 295.65 A: written down how much they make 

296.34 297.10 A: i mean not yeah 

297.59 298.11 A: okay 

306.17 306.90 A: okay 

310.77 314.52 B: and have a liability against their money on on these assets 

314.45 315.10 A: okay 

314.81 316.39 B: ah you know on these options 

315.39 315.96 A: so they can't 

316.44 318.57 A: like when they all cashed out before enron 

317.29 321.95 B: right and then then that'll mean that really a company's never making any money that um 

321.92 323.88 A: so nobody wins there either 

322.94 328.08 B: if they yeah if they allow for all the money they owe to their executives there isn't any profit left 

328.78 331.10 B: i think if that's the way i understand it correctly 

332.20 334.93 B: i don't know all that much about it either 

332.77 333.54 A: seem yeah 

334.17 336.00 A: right that they can go make millions as 

336.59 337.55 A: executives 

337.67 343.74 A: and then they have advanced notice cashed all their stocks out and everybody else was left with nothing that much i understood 

338.07 338.68 B: right 

341.51 344.11 B: i know and they don't care if the company falls or not 

344.77 345.88 A: pardon me 

345.38 349.50 B: they don't care if the company falls or not right 

347.40 348.90 A: right cause they have their money 

349.18 357.65 A: and and and yeah i read what did i see about the one one place (( )) the widow or whatever not the widow the wife had to auction off stuff 

357.38 358.09 B: i know it 

357.79 360.83 A: to to live i felt real bad about that i mean 

358.77 359.44 B: yeah 

359.98 362.47 B: really they they had like nine homes 

362.06 367.05 A: right they had to auction off stuff just to whittle down to one one bungalow 

362.64 363.06 B: yeah 

366.34 372.82 B: right she came on to defend her husband well you notice she's not been on t._v. anymore because it was exposed just 

370.31 371.85 A: no i mean i do watch enough 

372.33 375.70 A: c._n._n. and stuff and i do and i was paying somewhat attention to it 

373.43 375.06 B: right 

375.76 380.19 B: yeah how greedy they were i guess that was kenneth lay's wife 

379.70 380.25 A: okay 

380.34 382.71 B: if i rem- and i think he was with enron 

381.11 382.86 A: i didn't even make it through that movie 

382.93 384.74 B: yeah 

383.11 385.77 A: watching all the corporate greed got boring real quick 

385.56 388.81 B: well the trouble is it doesn't quit 

388.50 390.82 A: right that's just it's not ever (( )) 

391.73 398.25 A: i don't know what all the all these um stores going out of business and stuff people have their you know that much of a consumer of understanding it's

435.52 436.15 A: okay 

436.44 439.23 A: what what you know what was it up to at one point do you know er 

438.97 446.46 B: uh yeah i think not too long ago it was twelve dollars thirteen dollars you know to go down to seventeen cents 

444.42 445.36 A: wow 

447.93 451.83 B: an- and a while back it was twenty six dollars or something like that 

448.01 448.38 A: wow 

450.60 452.26 A: okay geeze 

451.93 452.67 B: but um 

453.24 453.96 B: it has 

454.13 455.07 B: uh fallen 

455.83 458.54 A: i i mean i knew they were relative i guess what was that uh 

459.10 460.71 A: mini crash a couple of years ago 

460.88 461.40 B: uh-huh 

461.24 463.69 A: i had a rel- relative who lost a lot on that i remember 

463.96 464.61 B: oh 

464.77 467.31 A: talking to him about that like i said it's just 

467.79 469.90 A: it seems almost like gambling to me that 

470.13 473.46 A: you know investing all your money and you're not 

471.24 472.08 B: right 

473.87 480.72 A: and there's no guarantee you're going to get it back and i don't know what you lost but obviously it's going to mess up your plans for the future 

480.79 484.34 B: right well everything is changing you know they say that uh 

484.45 487.75 B: you know their aren't jobs any more well the businesses don't have the money to 

487.88 495.08 B: keep people employed and it's like a vicious circle then people aren't shopping and so consequently it just goes around in a circle 

489.10 489.80 A: right 

493.09 493.75 A: right 

495.13 496.32 A: they just gave our um 

504.76 509.36 A: and our city council just gave themselves a ten percent cost of living wage- raises 

509.51 510.42 B: yeah it just 

511.30 511.94 B: right 

512.23 513.87 B: that doesn't seem fair that they 

516.69 518.53 A: (( )) hair dressers and 

519.23 522.79 A: and then there's like a barber they can go to right down there i mean we have to pay for all that and 

522.88 525.89 B: yeah yeah it uh it does not seem fair 

525.81 530.03 A: it all seems like you know a vicious circle with the government the stocks it's all tied up 

530.09 530.80 B: right
