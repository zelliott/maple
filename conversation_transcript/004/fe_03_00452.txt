243.77 244.74 B: drive 

244.97 248.28 B: a lot of places and uh 

248.76 250.09 B: it's like impossible

276.71 277.11 B: our 

277.29 279.64 B: our faults in general are really nice

372.85 378.29 B: that's eh it's sort of what i was getting at when i say i probably live in the wrong place that 

378.44 380.54 B: unfortunately the 

380.69 381.25 B: the 

381.79 383.62 B: the way the weather works 

384.45 385.68 B: is 

386.29 388.98 B: if it's really cold it's sunny 

389.33 390.22 B: and 

390.92 392.08 B: if it's 

394.02 396.57 B: so we get a lot of rain storms 

397.02 400.25 B: basically is what it comes down to um 

397.89 398.59 A: uh-huh 

400.87 401.51 B: and 

401.70 409.40 B: well i grew up in minnesota so i was definitely used to cold weather and i kind of like it and 

410.59 416.71 B: to me it is just so depressing tha- that it rains in the winter i mean it there's nothing 

416.82 421.05 B: worse than i can think of than uh 

421.18 425.82 B: it being thirty five degrees out and it's raining 

424.42 427.12 A: yeah it doesn't seem natural 

427.37 428.14 B: now 

427.89 428.34 A: yeah 

429.03 429.53 B: now 

431.81 437.36 A: when i was little it used to snow all the time and we'd have a week off from school and that was really nice 

437.41 438.04 B: mhm 

449.69 450.16 B: yeah 

450.45 451.23 A: that's just weird

453.20 458.82 B: minnesota has gotten almost no snow this year yeah 

454.44 457.31 A: really 

458.46 459.35 A: are they in a drought 

459.46 461.87 A: so weird did they never have a drought problem 

462.88 469.30 B: you know it's so funny because a lot of the midwest had a drought i i i know because my 

469.48 474.53 B: yeah my parents are still there so i'm in a lot of contact with them but 

471.27 471.72 A: yeah 

474.74 478.19 B: but actually minnesota had a very wet summer 

478.39 483.35 B: and and we had an extremely dry summer 

483.48 484.36 B: and yet 

484.97 487.30 B: but this fall and winter we've got 

487.42 489.29 B: tons of precipitations 

489.05 489.46 A: uh-huh 

489.54 490.65 B: so the 

490.76 502.22 B: places that are a little more north of here have gotten a lot of snow and down here we've gotten a lot of rain 

502.54 503.21 B: and 

503.38 506.43 B: this is how it's it's just like it just seems to 

506.74 507.93 B: never 

507.88 514.22 A: uh-huh sorry about that a bu- 

508.35 509.12 B: be

544.61 545.40 A: but 

546.52 551.97 A: it is frigid and very sunny it's not a combination that i like 

552.82 561.19 A: like i think if it's going to be this cold it should be snowing and i don't like the sun at all actually and i think it's from growing up in pittsburgh where you have 

555.66 556.30 B: right 

561.39 565.48 A: like fifty sunny days a year it's often overcast cause it's down in a valley 

565.91 566.36 B: mhm 

566.19 569.96 A: with all this sun it's just unnatural to me i don't like it at all 

571.22 572.34 A: i don't know 

573.11 576.40 B: it's funny i have a i have a friend who 

576.81 578.58 B: well she was born 

578.80 582.44 B: somewhere in pennsylvania i can't remember exactly where 

582.61 585.10 B: then spent most of her adult life 

585.27 586.90 B: in uh 

587.07 588.49 B: california
