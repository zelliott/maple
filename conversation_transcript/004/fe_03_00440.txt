41.83 45.75 A: effect directly but i guess it effect the economy 

46.38 48.49 A: eh a lot and ah 

48.84 49.33 A: it 

50.20 51.46 A: probably 

51.84 58.09 A: causes some decrease in stock value so i guess that effects me a little bit 

58.79 63.64 A: and it gets me i guess it i work for ah ah university 

63.95 64.43 B: mhm 

64.66 66.06 A: so it 

66.30 66.90 A: sort of 

67.72 69.85 A: gets me and i've been thinking about 

70.01 73.71 A: working for the (( corporate )) so that 

74.07 80.87 A: has changed my mind a lot and gets me more ideas about what people really do in the corporate's 

81.24 83.44 A: and it's just really disappointed and 

84.00 84.86 A: you know i 

84.99 92.19 A: it sort of confirmed my career choice that i'm going to stay in the academic at least for a little bit longer 

92.63 95.39 A: until i see some improvement in the corporate 

96.65 99.42 B: um what have you know as the monopolies is that 

99.59 101.58 B: is that what you are referring too 

102.19 102.61 B: monop- 

102.31 102.86 A: um 

102.76 104.85 B: corporate monopoly or 

103.20 106.13 A: not really no it's the 

106.40 115.38 A: there is this honestly and the things they do to manipulate the financial ah statements and all that too 

115.93 118.52 A: you know basically cheat about 

119.28 126.18 A: ah their earnings and so on and ah i've been actually reading a lot about 

126.35 127.01 A: (( )) 

127.24 127.92 A: how 

128.11 133.55 A: the the kind of crazy things they do you know how they have maybe four vacation 

135.59 135.84 A: (( )) 

136.64 140.12 A: elaborate vacations the c._l.'s do that 

139.70 142.16 B: oh yes i i read about that 

140.71 143.28 A: and while lying about 

143.62 147.26 A: the earnings and all that to boot up the 

147.56 151.23 A: the corpor- the stock markets and think about 

151.45 156.45 A: if i work in a corporate like that you know what make is probably 

165.80 170.51 A: and and um i wouldn't even know what my c._e._o. does and 

170.97 172.47 A: you know is just kind of 

172.98 178.72 A: disappointing to think that eh ah um people like me would be working very hard 

178.82 183.15 A: and the entry level or you know a lower level where as the 

183.63 186.78 A: bosses they can do whatever they wants 

187.24 189.82 A: to be (( dishonest )) and being be rewarded 

190.25 191.81 A: elaborately for 

192.61 194.19 A: for misconduct 

194.82 195.27 A: so 

194.84 195.75 B: that's true 

196.45 197.48 A: yes so it's just 

197.84 198.35 A: sort of 

198.54 199.31 A: it's kind of 

200.35 205.25 A: disappointing to see the actually is allowed and it happens in this country 

206.20 208.62 A: although you would think that 

208.91 212.59 A: the government and um the industry it's self self 

212.70 213.51 A: regulate 

213.68 214.95 A: and ah 

215.21 223.84 A: things like this especially at the free market things like this if it happens it should eventually cause the industry to go down 

224.04 224.71 B: mhm 

224.51 230.88 A: how can you make money and you can't you can lie for a short amount but if you're actually not making money how can you 

231.68 235.66 A: lie about it for a long time and still keep the business 

236.00 237.98 A: running i have no idea 

236.74 238.03 B: like the enron 

238.69 240.50 A: yeah yeah exactly 

240.99 241.61 B: mhm 

241.15 241.53 A: yeah 

242.03 246.22 A: and then we have there are a bunch of other cases coming out and 

247.20 247.52 A: it 

248.06 250.67 A: it's amazing how they can do that 

250.84 253.42 A: and ah think about how the all the employees 

253.89 255.34 A: they thought the we are not 

255.53 256.63 A: different from 

257.37 258.61 A: you and me that 

258.74 264.19 A: you know they probably didn't even know anything about this what their c._e.'s were actually doing 

265.79 267.65 B: well i think in the enron case 

267.82 268.37 B: they didn't 

268.52 271.80 B: all of their was it that all of their retirement plan was gone 

272.00 272.57 B: all of their 

272.34 273.31 A: mhm 

273.27 276.93 B: all their retirement money was gone and they had no idea 

287.32 287.76 B: mhm 

289.10 292.37 A: they probably all had stock in their company stock 

292.14 292.75 B: right 

293.20 297.39 A: so can you you know like some sometimes be like how can you even trust 

297.52 301.71 A: whether you're company is telling you it's the right thing and they keep 

301.92 306.44 A: saying you know it's good to buy the company stock you're putting your money in the 

306.94 309.11 A: company and then it's all gone 

309.44 310.64 B: mhm that 

311.31 315.02 B: we invest in my husband's last company and this stock 

313.98 314.49 A: mhm 

315.25 315.62 B: ah 

316.31 317.03 B: plummeted 

317.27 320.46 B: and the company was dishonest so and i understand how 

317.44 318.20 A: oh 

320.99 322.29 B: we suffered from that 

322.56 323.38 A: mhm 

323.53 326.94 B: but that that's a good point um and are they 

327.83 334.54 B: did the ah do the topics say that the government should be making laws to stopped this kind of practices 

336.24 338.40 A: the stock what say that again 

337.89 338.50 B: did 

338.60 339.36 B: did the 

339.83 342.88 B: um are th- is the government making laws 

343.05 344.36 B: to stop this kind of 

344.92 346.34 B: dishonest practices 

345.30 345.64 A: i 

346.53 347.07 A: think 

347.21 355.61 A: the government is trying to do something although i don't i haven't seen any concrete plans and i haven't followed the news very closely 

355.90 357.43 B: yeah me either 

356.71 358.57 A: you've seen a lot of talk 

359.05 360.05 A: um 

360.41 361.05 B: mhm 

360.81 364.40 A: how they can police the industry without 

365.61 367.46 A: i guess without violating 

375.11 375.82 A: you want to keep 

376.01 381.95 A: the market as free as possible and you don't want a lot of intrusions on the government 

382.09 383.90 A: but on the other hand you want 

391.41 393.96 A: fear with the function of the market and then that 

394.26 397.05 A: a negative to the economy as well 

398.21 398.75 A: um 

398.26 398.83 B: yeah 

398.97 403.26 A: so it where to find that balance is very tricky 

403.65 405.06 A: i don't know whether 

405.53 407.52 A: they doing a good job doing that 

408.43 415.18 B: i understand that there's got to be some way to protect people like you said the entry level positions and the lower 

414.89 415.18 A: mhm 

415.36 418.50 B: lower lower management positions from 

418.99 419.71 B: from abuse- 

422.05 422.67 A: yeah 

423.15 425.55 A: especially when when you have 

426.97 430.86 A: you know and and these are the people that are very (( loyal )) to the their 

431.01 432.26 A: their company 

432.25 432.94 B: uh-huh 

433.07 436.38 A: and they trust their company and you know a a few 

436.50 439.88 A: buying other stocks then you are 

441.80 442.37 B: right 

450.62 452.23 A: doing a good job and all that 

453.16 453.76 A: so think it 

454.17 454.83 A: kind of 

455.22 459.33 A: scary to know that you can't really trust your employer 

460.78 461.89 B: that's true 

462.08 468.84 B: that's true especially with with lower level and you're trusting you're in into a company friendly 

462.12 462.71 A: mhm 

468.51 469.37 A: mhm 

469.00 470.59 B: getting a good income and 

470.95 471.68 A: mhm 

471.76 473.27 B: trying to raise a family and then 

473.66 474.48 B: being lied to 

473.75 474.31 A: mhm 

475.34 476.00 A: right 

476.40 485.05 B: now the c._e._o.'s i have read something on the news about the c._e._o.'s earning exorbitant amounts of money and taking huge vacations 

484.45 485.08 A: mhm 

485.33 486.84 B: and having huge bonuses 

487.03 489.09 B: which they don't pass on to their employees 

487.30 487.72 A: mhm 

489.48 490.12 A: mhm 

490.85 491.28 B: so 

494.28 494.59 B: but 

494.74 495.23 B: i'm not 

495.44 499.03 B: but other then my husband's stock last year it hasn't 

498.93 499.44 A: mhm 

499.72 501.10 B: effects us directly 

500.02 500.75 A: expect it 

501.35 501.99 A: uh-huh 

505.70 508.45 A: well it it's the com- company 

509.10 510.58 A: does your husband work 

510.82 512.27 A: for a business or 

513.45 514.00 B: he 

514.15 519.15 B: we we both graduated with bachelors degrees and i stayed home to raise the 

517.13 517.75 A: uh-huh 

518.93 519.34 A: uh-huh 

519.45 523.76 B: raise the children and he went to work for a company that um 

524.52 530.39 B: a computer that originally did well and then their stocks plummeted which we had invested in the company stocks 

529.68 530.33 A: mhm 

530.77 531.38 A: mhm 

531.37 536.26 B: but then he was able to go to a different job which seems more honest but 

536.06 536.70 A: mhm 

536.37 538.70 B: you don't really know when you're at lower level 

539.11 541.97 A: no i think most people don't know on 

542.12 543.25 A: unless you 

543.61 546.41 A: you know must people in the company probably don't know 

546.70 547.44 B: that's true 

547.35 548.27 A: until 

548.51 550.80 A: i i think that only the c._e._o. knows 

550.84 551.48 B: mhm 

551.06 552.23 A: it's everybody else 

552.37 555.94 A: pretty much and can pretty much (( alter )) the document and 

557.46 559.28 A: a financial (( analysis )) 

559.93 562.63 A: so only the person who is not being honest 

562.75 563.98 A: would know the truth 

565.07 565.95 A: um 

566.38 567.47 A: my husband was 

567.61 567.96 A: first 

568.35 570.43 A: small stock company too 

570.71 571.27 B: mhm 

571.27 573.95 A: um and they keep saying how 

574.23 579.48 A: he has been working there for almost two years he worked for i._b._m. before 

579.46 580.08 B: wow 

579.57 579.95 A: which 

580.18 583.92 A: we thought was a pretty secure job and then 

583.19 583.69 B: mhm 

584.38 587.68 A: recently the entire office has been closed 

587.34 588.14 B: oh no 

588.09 597.04 A: they give you like two months in notice or something like which i think is very generous compared to other stories i've heard
