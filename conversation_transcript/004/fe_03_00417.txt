172.19 175.50 A: well it uh they live in places that are nice to go to so that's 

175.71 179.09 A: that makes it not bad you know scottsdale arizona and 

179.22 180.08 A: and lake tahoe 

180.37 180.65 A: so 

181.36 181.84 A: um

184.12 184.68 A: -s um 

185.92 188.28 A: you know it's not easy to travel with the family 

189.96 190.54 A: cross-country 

194.49 197.24 A: travel as much as i used to so i don't have as many frequent flier miles 

198.78 199.66 A: travel easier 

199.35 201.42 B: the the key to all family travel 

202.07 208.13 B: yeah um yeah we we uh i mean i regret i think a little bit staying in the area so much 

208.65 209.40 B: but um 

209.89 213.18 B: and we we my husband and i joke all the time that we want to 

213.56 217.54 B: to move you know that we're going to pack our bags and move across country and just start over but 

218.23 218.76 B: it the 

218.93 220.85 B: honestly the family thing always 

221.08 221.90 B: keeps us here 

222.36 225.96 B: you know my grandparents are getting older my grandfather's been really sick 

226.19 226.78 B: and 

227.07 228.73 B: you know the thought of not being here 

229.20 232.66 B: you know i'm i am the closest relative to my grandparents so 

232.81 237.30 B: when something comes up i'm always the first one there i'm the one they call when they need something 

237.45 242.22 B: and uh i don't know the thought of of leaving that behind is very difficult 

243.64 246.59 A: well i b- i lived in a lot of different parts of the country 

253.98 255.08 A: there are other places 

255.72 257.74 A: that i like and i could probably live but 

258.85 259.16 A: i don't 

260.59 261.68 A: see any other areas that 

262.02 263.76 A: i'm strongly motivated to move to 

263.81 271.63 B: yeah i think if i could afford a nice house in san diego i'd be gone tomorrow forget my family but i couldn't afford a house there anyway so 

271.20 272.15 A: well that is 

273.01 274.77 A: pretty expensive part of the country but i 

274.91 275.18 A: i 

275.90 276.62 A: agree with you s- 

276.78 277.77 A: san diego would be great 

277.83 278.91 B: yeah how old are your kids 

279.33 279.83 A: uh 

280.48 281.13 A: five and eight 

281.38 281.90 B: okay 

282.70 286.44 B: okay yeah we don't have um any kids yet we're actually um becoming foster parents 

286.68 287.13 A: oh really 

287.15 289.79 B: yes we're going to we're going to adopt through the foster system 

290.45 291.27 A: well that will uh 

291.12 291.41 B: so 

296.68 297.37 A: build a family 

297.35 300.45 B: ye- well yeah um i can't have children and uh 

300.82 304.53 B: i'm i'm very i've always wanted to adopt even before i knew i couldn't have my own 

304.70 306.83 B: and so um it's never been 

306.93 313.90 B: you know a a a problem for us um i actually work with an organization that works with disadvantaged children 

314.04 314.60 B: um 

314.70 315.38 B: so it works 

315.55 324.23 B: it works well it sort of um combines my my love for children and my my great want to have a family with um 

325.06 326.67 B: my other love which is helping 

326.84 330.54 B: you know children and helping families so i- it kind of combines the two 

330.65 331.84 B: it works out well for us 

331.96 334.43 B: and uh so we have to finish our twenty hours of 

335.31 336.01 B: of uh 

336.17 336.87 B: training 

337.45 338.57 B: before we're allowed to 

338.86 339.71 B: pick our child 

340.10 340.43 A: wow 

340.35 342.88 B: so we're excited it's it's uh it's a lot of work 

343.15 343.46 B: but 

344.29 344.82 A: well i- 

344.37 344.88 B: it'll be 

345.34 346.07 B: we're we're um 

346.34 350.34 B: i i come from a humongous family my mom is one of eight my dad is one of eight 

350.83 355.26 B: um i'm the oldest of eighteen grandchildren on one side and twenty four on the other 

355.40 355.85 A: wow 

356.03 357.11 B: so um 

357.78 362.85 B: i'm the only one well that's not true because i'm the oldest but i'm the only one that's married that doesn't have kids 

363.62 367.69 B: and so it's very it's hard going to family gatherings and having everybody else 

367.94 376.47 B: have their kids or you know getting the phone calls you know someone else is pregnant and you know you don't have your own because it it's really important to me that i that i have a family 

376.52 378.05 A: yeah well and and 

378.37 380.06 A: i have a lot of admiration for people that 

380.63 381.38 A: that um 

381.74 382.20 A: do 

382.44 383.24 A: take care of 

383.83 385.23 A: foster children i mean it's 

386.13 386.53 A: dumb 

386.80 388.26 A: it's got to be very tough for the kids and 

389.50 390.31 A: there are a variety of 

390.65 393.29 A: ways i guess they can get into that situation but 

394.44 395.14 A: it's sure great that 

396.14 397.00 A: especially when you see some 

398.30 398.70 A: have 

401.64 403.96 B: uh that will not be us 

404.42 406.46 B: two would be good 

406.70 409.23 A: uh and and i think it's just uh i think it's great 

409.50 410.11 B: yeah 

410.50 416.77 B: it it it's very difficult um like i said with this organization i work with they um we do this fund-raiser 

416.89 417.45 B: and 

417.67 421.17 B: um some of the kids that we work with are in foster care 

421.31 423.21 B: and we invited them 

423.74 428.50 B: we got sponsors to pay for them to come to our fund-raiser it's a it's a bowl-a-thon and 

429.75 432.79 B: it was so neat to see these kids i mean some of these 

432.95 433.85 B: some of these 

434.31 435.71 B: kids are in are in families 

436.20 443.29 B: where excuse me exactly what you said there's like eight nine ten foster kids living under one roof and these you know these foster parents 

441.31 441.68 A: mhm 

443.61 446.61 B: you know there's there's two types of foster parents there's the ones that do it 

447.09 448.32 B: because they want to do it 

448.42 452.71 B: and they want to help these kids and there's the ones that do it for the extra money each month 

453.16 458.78 B: with what they give you i can't even imagine how there's anything extra but that's beside the point um 

459.40 463.23 B: and some of these kids you know these these foster parents can't afford 

463.71 471.39 B: any extra curricular by the time they pay for the clothes and the food and the d- uh and whatever else they need to pay for there's nothing left at the end of the month 

471.53 480.05 B: and these kids had the best time and it just reinforces you know the whole thing like why you know why you're doing what you're doing so 

480.80 481.46 B: it's uh 

482.09 484.33 B: so we're having it again this year and we're we're excited 

485.02 487.00 B: see how it how it works out this year but 

487.30 487.64 A: (( well )) 

487.86 488.96 A: that's great it's um 

489.53 490.49 A: such a great cause 

490.61 490.92 B: yeah 

491.13 493.18 B: so i don't know what else to talk about 

492.80 494.42 A: well 

494.55 495.77 A: i i think we've 

496.03 497.25 A: probably covered a fair amount 

498.43 501.66 A: fairly short time maybe we need to talk slower or something 

500.68 501.16 B: oka- 

501.27 504.05 B: does this just end or do we have to just hang up do you 

504.15 504.43 A: i 

504.66 505.98 A: i don't know i guess um 

505.53 505.95 B: okay 

506.78 507.95 A: keep going for a little while and 

508.49 509.32 A: i am assuming they'll 

510.28 512.31 A: they'll have something that comes in i've 

512.51 513.14 A: i've had 

513.40 514.55 A: probably um 

515.11 516.73 A: eight voice mail messages the last 

517.00 518.07 A: two afternoons and i've 

517.96 518.39 B: yes 

518.31 519.40 A: been out the whole time 

520.78 524.39 B: i i've been here a couple of times but no one else ever picks up 

524.56 524.97 A: oh really 

525.05 526.79 B: yeah so i work from home 

527.49 530.68 B: and so i'm sitting here and it it'll call will you accept the call 

527.54 527.83 A: oh 

530.84 531.25 B: yes 

531.62 536.35 B: can you wait sure and then it waits and it waits and it waits and it waits and nobody comes on and i just hang up 

537.07 540.55 A: well this is the first time i got to the point where it asked me my pin and then 

541.31 545.61 A: of course i didn't have my computer hooked up so i had to plug it in and re-boot 

546.38 547.84 A: so uh that uh 

548.03 548.78 A: took up a while 

548.76 550.14 B: what what made you decide to do this 

550.83 551.29 A: um 

551.58 555.16 A: well i'm interested in voice technologies and 

555.65 556.29 A: i thought well 

559.36 559.72 A: about it 

563.92 564.84 A: few extra bucks tha-
