160.32 165.82 A: i wanted to go to harvard actually but i didn't get in to any of the ivy leagues so that's why i'm here 

162.32 163.45 B: mhm 

165.62 167.77 B: oh well [laughter] 

167.11 168.05 A: so 

167.84 170.19 B: did you i mean do you like it there or 

169.90 173.90 A: i enjoy it yeah i mean there's there's lots to do like i said 

174.06 174.87 B: (( mhm mm )) 

174.07 176.50 A: do you find the penn is pretty hard mhm 

176.32 184.71 B: um is it like i'm in warden so it's i think it's harder than like the college classes but um 

184.82 185.82 B: [lipsmack] i mean 

185.87 187.89 B: i can't imagine that it's 

188.07 191.32 B: like overwhelmingly much harder than 

191.74 193.31 B: other colleges would be 

193.07 197.56 A: is it possible to take business as like an an undergrad major there 

197.68 200.70 B: um not if you're not in warden 

200.43 201.38 A: (( uh-huh )) 

201.28 204.61 B: so you need to be in warden to get like any kind of 

204.98 211.52 B: like major from there but you can like economics isn't considered part of warden so if you're in the college you can 

211.56 213.89 B: get economics but you can't get like 

214.02 217.34 B: you know finance or accounting or marketing or any of that 

217.00 221.79 A: okay well 'cause i thought uh warden school was only for business 

221.99 223.85 B: yeah it it's only business 

223.63 226.76 A: i thought you were in marketing and communications 

226.88 228.40 B: right i'm in warden 

228.47 232.13 A: oh so that is like a a s- a type of business 

230.97 233.89 B: oh we're oh yeah sorry um 

233.84 237.59 B: okay so like we have like concentrations 

237.21 238.11 A: mhm 

237.49 249.49 B: and basically it means that you take four classes in that subject so there's like the primary would be like marketing but then they also have another one which is marketing and communications 

246.30 247.14 A: right 

249.10 249.99 A: uh-huh 

249.74 253.50 B: so you take four marketing classes and then you take four communications classes 

253.21 256.69 A: so that's not too bad you can do like a bunch of 'em if you really wanted mhm 

256.54 258.88 B: yeah yeah um 

258.90 267.73 B: like i think most people kind of do two or maybe three um but it's cool because you can like take you can get like stuff outside of warden 

267.74 268.66 A: right 

267.94 270.92 B: but you would need to get that as kind of like 

271.21 279.49 B: like a duel degree but um for like your primary like major whatever it needs to be like business or like one of the joint programs so 

272.39 273.53 A: mhm 

278.94 280.00 A: okay 

279.88 281.20 B: (( yeah )) 

280.56 284.45 A: so if you would've gone to m._i._t. would you've been like a 

284.58 286.28 A: an engineer person 

286.52 290.59 B: um probably not like they have a really good business school too 

290.37 292.56 A: i never realised that 

291.03 291.81 B: so 

291.89 301.93 B: yeah actually a lot of people don't know and i didn't know either until i like saw like a random like listing and i was like wow m._i._t. has got like the i think it was about the time of like the second best business undergrad 

301.45 306.14 A: oh wow because you talk to people who are going to m._i._t. for like english and it's like 

301.99 302.75 B: so 

306.15 307.64 A: why bother you know 

307.57 319.18 B: yeah my brother goes to m._i._t. and he was basically telling me that like if you're not in engineering you take that and engineering but you can't just do like business because ever- everybody like laughs at you and everything 

314.72 315.86 A: oh really 

318.29 320.83 A: [laughter] that's really funny 

319.34 320.29 B: [laughter] 

320.34 324.85 B: (( [laughter] yeah it is a little bit intimidating as well because i was like hmm [laughter] )) 

323.81 328.77 A: because it's so useful to be an engineer and like a a poet or something you know 

328.46 331.12 B: yeah [laughter] 

329.95 332.44 A: [laughter] what did you do for your christmas break 

332.68 336.77 B: um just went home hung out watched movies how 'bout you 

336.66 339.03 A: i went uh skiing in colorado 

339.16 340.49 B: oh wow 

339.92 348.00 A: so that was fun and i went to visit my grandparents and my girlfriend so i was only home for like a couple of days over break so it was fun 

347.93 349.21 B: (( oh okay )) 

348.68 350.67 A: when did you guys start back 

350.30 352.74 B: um on the thirteenth 

352.64 355.12 A: okay yeah i started back on the fifteenth 

355.12 359.62 B: oh okay and then were you finished with classes early december or 

355.90 356.73 A: but 

359.41 364.76 A: um no like mid december so i i guess you're a little bit luckier than we are 

361.86 362.73 B: okay 

364.60 369.58 B: no we're i was here 'til the twentieth of december yeah [laughter] 

367.07 368.21 A: oh wow 

368.44 369.85 A: that kind of stinks 

369.70 371.22 B: yeah so 

371.23 374.92 B: we had a i think it was mm it was pretty short but 

373.88 376.65 A: now did you have exams before break mhm 

376.10 377.12 B: yeah 

377.29 379.04 B: do you have 'em before or after 

378.82 383.82 A: i had 'em before i heard that harvard though takes their exams after break 

383.48 385.93 B: yeah i think princeton does that as well 

384.08 384.84 A: so 

385.56 386.63 A: really 

386.28 387.28 B: mhm 

386.64 392.05 A: that must be really nice because then if you get behind in anything then you ca- you have like a whole month to catch up mhm 

391.46 397.71 B: that's true i don't know like i guess it has its goods and its bads because then you have to worry about it over break 

397.79 403.46 B: you know like it's kind of nice because it'd be like i'm done like and not have to think about anything 

400.97 402.07 A: that's true 

403.16 404.26 A: that's true 

405.11 415.42 A: yeah actually i'm taking a kind of a business class this semester i just started it today it's uh entrepreneurial finance it's pretty cool 'cause there's no like business program here 

412.11 413.20 B: (( oh okay )) 

415.19 416.28 B: mhm 

415.68 416.72 A: but um 

416.74 419.19 A: that's about as close as you can get so 

418.60 423.43 B: right oh that's really cool so how do you like rate your major and your school and everything 

423.31 431.95 A: um i like it so far i just recently decided on political science as a major because i've heard that the econ department here isn't very good and i was considering that otherwise 

431.65 432.63 B: mhm 

431.98 435.35 A: but i mean tufts is a pretty good school um 

434.43 435.35 B: mhm 

435.81 443.02 A: like one thing i wish i could do more is that i'm really into debating and our debate team here is really really bad and we have no money 

439.27 440.20 B: mhm 

442.93 444.07 B: oh really 

443.21 449.24 A: so i mean like your school probably sends people you know on planes and stuff but we have to like 

449.29 452.74 A: we can only go if we can take like the subway to it or something 

452.48 453.44 B: mhm 

452.86 457.58 A: so it's really lame in that regard but there's some other good stuff about it 

455.19 456.13 B: (( oh )) 

457.05 459.20 B: mhm and how do you like spanish 

459.08 461.20 A: uh it's okay 

461.11 462.07 B: mhm 

461.87 462.90 A: i mean 

463.35 467.96 A: [lipsmack] i don't know i'm trying to finish in three years so i might not have a chance to do that because 

467.98 472.22 A: i mean it's a lot of work to do two majors you know in three years 

470.68 471.51 B: mhm 

471.64 472.69 B: yeah 

472.23 473.75 A: but we'll see

485.99 497.56 B: in local elementary schools so it's actually yeah it's actually really really cool um i'm in just like random like you know clubs like warden women and you know just random [laughter] things 

487.36 488.52 A: that's cool 

494.84 496.23 A: [laughter] 

496.38 497.80 A: that's a funny name 

497.69 503.81 B: yeah it's i mean it's a place to get together and meet other people i guess so 

502.72 503.92 A: that's cool

525.81 527.10 B: oh cool 

527.48 529.05 B: that's fun 

528.60 532.66 A: i'm sure they get like really hard core about it and everything 

532.10 534.15 B: [laughter] 

532.92 544.15 A: but i tried to sign up for the ultimate frisbee team earlier this year and they're like all right we have practice three times a week and they have like a coach and they went to nationals and everything and i was like holy crap

545.23 548.66 A: yeah like who really wants to get that into ultimate frisbee 

548.34 550.04 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

549.46 554.54 A: and then if you go and tell people like you're the national champion from ultimate frisbee they'll laugh at you 

554.09 559.06 B: (( [laughter] i don't know it get it gets kind of competitive i guess [laughter] ))
