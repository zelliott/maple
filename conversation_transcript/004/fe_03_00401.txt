61.64 62.00 A: oh yeah 

62.77 64.44 B: undergrad and we don't have any of that 

64.69 66.19 B: fancy wireless stuff 

66.16 67.73 A: where are you at 

66.85 68.89 B: yeah um i'm in milwaukee 

68.89 69.20 A: uh huh 

69.40 71.17 B: at the university of wisconsin milwaukee 

71.43 71.71 A: hm 

72.86 73.17 B: so 

73.73 74.18 A: i'm 

75.05 78.04 A: i was in grad school i guess it's been about 

78.40 80.04 A: seven years so there was 

87.78 88.17 B: right 

90.67 90.98 B: right 

95.74 101.74 A: you had to write the paper on the computer but ther- didn't have that many other applications as i recall 

97.84 98.20 B: yeah 

105.09 107.73 A: now you can go and basically look up anything on the internet 

107.72 108.13 B: mhm 

108.56 112.68 A: what i do at work all day so i'm assuming that's kind of what happens in colleges as well 

112.69 118.80 B: yeah and i know some of the classes i've worked with like the one o. one undergrad classes i've t._a.'d 

118.95 119.35 A: mhm 

119.10 120.26 B: more recently 

120.53 123.48 B: they've done lots of having things online 

123.62 126.27 B: where you can go look up lecture notes and things like that 

126.11 126.56 A: right 

126.68 127.96 A: get there assignments 

127.71 133.52 B: right get your assignments there was on class where everybody had to buy along with the textbook a c._d.-rom 

133.74 136.89 B: that had these kind of interactive modules 

137.05 139.20 B: that went with the chapters they were reading in the book 

138.51 140.12 A: huh that's interesting 

140.17 140.57 B: and 

140.76 145.65 B: so that was part of their assignment to do and i thought that was good that it got them more involved 

145.66 146.04 A: mhm 

146.19 149.49 B: and at least they had to turn in a thing to prove that they did it 

149.84 150.19 A: right 

149.88 150.85 B: where as 

151.03 153.85 B: reading the books who knows whether or not they did 

152.58 155.98 A: exactly yeah that whole interactive element 

156.09 156.53 B: yeah 

156.82 157.30 B: and i know 

156.86 157.33 A: (( )) 

157.68 161.82 B: there was some people who were kind of scared of by that but lots of people seemed to really like it 

161.89 163.06 A: yeah you get into it then 

164.54 165.50 A: probably more exciting for 

165.63 166.36 A: student as well 

166.52 168.08 B: right yeah just being more 

168.31 169.16 B: involved in it 

169.59 170.76 A: do you find th- 

170.89 174.62 A: the students still have to buy the same amounts of textbooks as they've always been buying 

174.84 177.15 B: um yeah i don't think that's really changed 

177.09 177.42 A: hm 

177.27 178.82 B: it seems like it's more the- 

179.08 180.73 B: are doing some extra things 

181.54 183.07 B: online or on the computer 

183.13 184.26 A: yeah that's interesting 

183.64 185.79 B: i- it's not replacing the textbooks 

185.15 185.45 A: (( )) 

185.87 192.28 A: there was talk a few years ago about how bad the textbook industry was you know was going to suffer from all this but i guess they really haven't 

191.52 191.84 B: right 

192.61 193.03 B: yeah 

193.82 204.23 B: i know at my university sometimes there are like when there are articles on reserve and things like that they've been moving to have those you don't actually go to the library to get them you can print them out or read them online 

203.72 204.16 A: mhm 

204.36 204.71 A: mhm 

204.88 207.73 B: which i but then i think they run into all kinds of copyright 

207.97 208.33 A: right 

208.13 209.47 B: problems with that to 

209.17 209.51 A: yeah 

210.12 210.63 A: (( )) 

211.41 213.50 A: i remember we had to buy all these sort of 

213.64 214.79 A: photocopied 

215.45 215.78 B: right 

215.80 218.23 A: chapters of books mostly written by like 

218.49 219.39 A: our professors 

219.54 220.01 A: they were like 

219.55 219.87 B: yeah 

220.11 220.37 A: yeah 

220.51 223.12 A: ridiculously priced for copyright reasons i guess 

223.27 223.54 B: yep 

225.32 226.46 A: interesting 

227.55 228.60 A: what are you studying there 

228.63 230.34 B: um clinical psychology 

230.30 230.78 A: uh 

237.70 238.20 A: um 

241.43 241.78 A: mhm 

243.27 244.36 B: but he's had 

244.84 245.50 B: them 

245.62 246.25 B: some of his 

246.38 249.82 B: tenth grade students i think y- n- it's just general tenth grade english 
250.42 251.50 B: where they're 

251.89 254.02 B: making they're own web pages 

253.88 254.31 A: mhm 

254.22 257.13 B: they put up some of their writing projects and things like that 

257.20 257.46 A: right 

257.85 259.10 B: which i think is really good 

259.72 262.01 B: for and he teaches at more of an inner-city 

262.40 264.48 B: type school where i think the kids don't 

264.79 265.06 B: aren't 

265.91 268.93 B: as likely to have computers at home and have access to that 

268.96 269.37 A: mhm 

269.66 270.97 B: so i think it's good that he is 

271.41 274.11 B: kind of teaching them how to make just a real rudimentary 

274.22 274.75 A: yeah th- 

274.44 275.20 B: web page 

276.15 276.50 B: yeah 

278.64 279.26 A: i have some 

279.41 280.18 A: (( )) 

280.29 284.42 A: you know kids who are ten and eleven and they're just so amazingly computer illiterate and it 

284.55 287.81 A: you know it's a necessity to have a computer in the home to do the school project 

288.33 288.88 A: totally 

289.92 291.68 A: whether good or bad it's totally there 

291.87 292.21 B: yeah 

292.10 292.65 A: (( )) 

293.21 294.63 A: transformationally 

294.41 294.73 B: yep 

294.95 297.95 A: do either of you um use instant messaging at all in 

298.48 298.86 B: um 

298.68 299.94 A: like in an educational setting 

299.99 300.59 B: no 

301.90 305.90 B: i haven't really done much instant messaging at all i'm online all the time and do 

306.23 307.12 B: emailing and stuff 

307.19 307.51 A: uh huh 

308.40 309.43 A: it's interesting cause we use it 

309.53 311.21 A: in our office actually eve- you know 

311.50 313.30 A: been like a really good way to like communicate with like 

313.49 314.10 A: work-mates 

314.38 316.84 A: there on the phone and you have to ask them a question right away you can 

317.04 318.65 A: send them an instant message 

318.16 318.50 B: yeah 

318.79 319.97 A: i was reading 

320.15 324.24 A: some university libraries are incorporating instant messaging 

324.97 327.86 A: so that even if you're in the library and you have a question that 

328.03 335.80 A: you- be embarrassed to go up and ask a librarian face to face if you think it's a stupid question they feel a lot better just sort of typing it to some 

335.93 338.65 A: unseen librarian somewhere and then get the answer back 

339.26 346.20 B: yeah and i think that's true even with my students and being a student myself that sometimes it is easier to 

348.17 352.33 B: in not having to actually approach the professors it makes them more approachable 

352.27 352.63 A: mhm 

353.53 353.92 B: so 

354.13 357.55 B: and i think it's good just in being able to be in touch with people 

358.03 360.63 B: and just as a t._a. it makes my life easier 

360.53 361.01 A: mhm 

360.74 363.56 B: when they can email me a question and i can write them back when i have a chance 

363.80 364.22 A: yeah 

363.90 365.79 B: but i don't have to be sitting by the phone to wait 

366.02 368.17 B: for them to call me or play phone tag or whatever 

368.40 372.24 A: right that makes a lot of sense yeah we really had none of that when i was in college at all 

375.17 375.48 A: mhm 

377.07 378.85 A: what else 

386.51 390.56 A: i have no idea how it must be effecting you know the mathematics and the sciences 

390.66 392.00 A: (( )) 

391.34 391.74 B: yeah 

392.86 395.28 A: i mean i had when i was an undergrad i had a 

395.64 400.42 A: a classmate who was a computer science major this was like in the mid-eighties and that was all about 

400.64 404.72 A: punch cards you know and they would go and we would use like the punch cards (( )) 

401.97 402.32 B: yeah 

406.23 406.81 A: and know it 

407.50 408.56 A: so far beyond that it- 

408.70 409.03 A: scary 

409.28 409.66 B: yeah 

410.39 412.29 B: i mean i think it's neat some of the 

412.67 414.98 B: science type things and i mean i work at more the 

415.11 415.88 B: behavioral 

416.08 416.66 B: sciences 

416.77 417.23 A: uh-huh 

417.19 420.50 B: side of things but how they can do modeling and all these things 

421.49 422.48 B: on computers 

422.60 422.91 A: right 

423.06 423.33 B: that 

424.04 431.05 B: and even i think i've seen about you know doing a on c._d.-rom instead of actually dissecting frogs 

431.52 432.34 B: things like that 

431.54 432.42 A: yeah i think i 

432.54 435.93 A: yep i think i read something about they're actual web-site even that have like 

437.11 438.24 A: a frog you can dissect 

438.41 438.73 B: right 

438.90 439.26 B: yeah 

439.84 443.60 B: yeah and actually one of the classes that i t._a.'d was a cognitive 

443.83 445.93 B: psych class where they 

454.78 455.15 A: mhm 

462.13 462.49 A: hm 

465.55 466.06 A: um 

466.96 472.15 A: i had a thought there a second ago and the- then i lost it 

475.54 475.96 A: um 

476.97 479.06 A: oh about the do you find that um 

480.15 483.85 A: some students are just sort of like totally addicted to the computer to much that it 

484.53 485.22 A: -tracting for them 

486.03 486.59 B: um 

487.00 487.41 A: (( )) 

487.06 489.24 B: sometimes i think that for myself 

488.47 490.24 A: yeah i think that for myself to 

490.90 491.20 B: but 

491.65 497.53 B: i- it hasn't been that much of a problem and i think some of it might be more of a socio-economic 

497.90 498.89 B: group of student 

498.85 499.48 A: mhm 

499.29 501.33 B: at my university it's a real urban 

501.88 505.55 B: school and lots of them are older students who are working and have families 

505.80 506.16 A: right 

505.82 506.12 B: and 

506.23 507.57 B: things like that and 

507.99 510.97 B: it seems like many of them are just so busy with other things 

511.52 511.89 A: mhm 

511.68 515.08 B: and don't necessarily have their own access to computers 

515.01 515.37 A: right 

517.83 519.48 A: i guess also that uh 

520.12 520.60 A: (( )) 

520.71 523.68 A: addictive for us because it's a sort of an amazing new technology that 

524.04 525.47 A: simplified our lives whereas 

525.70 528.34 A: people growing up with it know it'll become sort of commonplace 

528.61 528.97 B: right 

530.36 530.61 B: but 

530.78 532.26 B: but yeah it is true how it 

532.96 535.61 B: think for people who have a lot of access 

535.76 539.41 B: it just becomes so basic that that's how you communicate with people 

539.30 539.70 A: mhm 

539.58 539.97 B: and that 

540.23 541.00 B: how you 

541.49 542.40 B: do anything 

542.54 546.60 B: i was at work working where most of my co-workers are like women middle-aged 

547.17 549.46 B: women in their fifties or something like that and we were 

549.07 549.37 A: mhm 

549.71 552.17 B: talking about going out for lunch to a restaurant and 

552.87 553.26 B: and 

553.36 560.01 B: they were like well let's look it up in the phone book and we can call them and find out what their hours er are and all these things and i'm just like sitting at the computer typing 

559.44 560.58 A: yep 

560.44 565.03 B: and by the time they'd gotten on the phone i had the menu half printed out and 

565.59 566.25 A: exactly 

565.92 568.04 B: i mean just that i'm really used to 

568.58 571.92 B: that if there's anything that i want to know i'm kind of appalled if i can't find it 

571.95 572.36 A: right 

572.24 572.68 B: online 

572.56 574.39 A: you just expect to find it online 

574.55 578.58 A: it's true that's what i do pretty much all day at work to i'm a research librarian for a 

578.68 581.33 A: a corporation so people are always asking me you know 

579.53 579.98 B: okay 

581.43 584.57 A: any number of questions and a lot of it we use you know 

584.77 588.87 A: legitimate databases and a lot of it is more just sort of searching the web trying to find 

589.32 589.61 B: right 

589.66 590.92 A: real sources 

590.90 591.23 B: yeah 

591.95 592.28 A: so 

593.40 594.10 A: that 

595.10 595.63 A: the 

596.07 597.59 A: i 

596.52 596.87 B: yeah 

597.92 599.97 A: i felt like really over-using the tech-
