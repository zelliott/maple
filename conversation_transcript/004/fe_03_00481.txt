479.15 480.37 A: you not get sick as often 

480.64 482.27 B: um 

482.66 486.11 B: it makes it what happened is i would be very tired and i was i-

508.15 509.64 B: not good 

510.34 511.12 A: so you know 

511.26 515.66 A: well i guess uh we both agree if you do see the doctor more often you probably stay healthier

519.83 520.49 A: with me uh 

520.66 521.06 A: uh

526.31 526.99 B: uh-huh 

527.21 529.34 B: uh very expensive too 

530.30 532.97 A: mhm but especially with gland specialists you can't find them 

533.44 535.22 B: no they're hard they're hard to find 

538.00 546.23 B: and it's like i'm here in kissimmee i have to go to orlando i mean but i think there's one here but it's not a participating doctor in the medical insurance 

547.56 552.05 A: uh he- yeah that's always fun too trying to find somebody that the insurance will cover 

552.17 553.32 B: exactly

565.80 571.08 B: there's some (( to do )) in kissimmee there's some in orlando and then you call and nobody takes it
