0.00 1.65 A: hi i'm donna 

1.23 3.54 B: hi donna i'm thelma 

3.38 7.75 A: hi thelma do you believe that the weather infl- or you know the seasons influence 

7.73 9.26 B: oh heavens yes 

9.59 12.44 B: in several different ways don't you 

12.45 18.52 A: oh my god yeah you know i i moved up from florida a year and a half ago to ohio 

15.88 16.55 B: (( [laughter] )) 

19.73 31.11 A: and you know it's the reverse when i moved to florida i went like nine months without a sinus problem and then i come back up here and it was like nine months and now it's all starting over again and 

31.31 39.09 A: it's just amazing how this is going to sound stupid how much earlier it gets dark up here than it does in florida and how depressing that it is 

38.82 46.41 B: [laughter] well especially this year but in in fact more than sinus is arthritis is bad 

46.43 49.66 B: uh people with breathing you know 

50.51 52.59 B: problems it affects 

53.30 56.49 B: quite quite rapidly too this year 

56.62 58.71 A: i know you know i 

58.72 64.41 A: i try to fight you know it the with the wind chill it was one degree here today and i'm not used to this 

64.21 65.38 B: [laughter] 

64.66 70.21 A: [laughter] and so whenever i get the first inkling that i'm getting sick i pop a bunch of echinacea 

70.44 72.11 B: oh does it work 

71.57 74.05 A: [laughter] oh it really and truly does 

74.10 76.39 A: uh my boss told me about it 

75.78 77.07 B: mhm 

76.46 86.20 A: and um i've got it and you know it says to take it every day well i don't do that i mean i take my i'm a cancer survivor so i you know i take my vitamins like i should and everything 

83.65 84.64 B: oh 

86.34 87.80 A: but at the first 

88.01 93.68 A: sign that i'm getting a sore throat or anything like that i take like three echinacea and it really does work 

93.95 98.37 B: see i i've been raised right here i'm in pennsylvania erie 

98.13 99.08 A: uh-huh 

99.05 100.46 B: and 

100.74 104.46 B: i've had sinus and allergy problems all my life 

105.23 107.43 B: but this year i've got arthritis 

107.91 114.49 B: so now does this weather upset the um even though you- you've survived the cancer 

108.51 109.50 A: oh what a 

115.12 118.10 A: i i'm sorry i didn't get that does the weather what 

116.09 117.17 B: [noise] 

118.31 122.46 B: um does that uh even though you have survived cancer 

123.58 125.76 B: does that affect 

126.90 128.42 A: yeah um 

128.48 133.05 A: i mean i've changed my whole attitude and everything you know since the cancer 

132.43 133.36 B: right 

133.94 138.59 A: but yeah i i think [sigh] the weather affects me more because i 

138.65 142.58 A: i think after a cancer diagnosis you look at life differently 

141.98 143.14 B: mhm 

143.47 148.19 A: and i mean there's so many things i want to be doing i don't want to be cooped up in an apartment [laughter] 

147.92 149.31 B: [laughter] 

148.56 157.84 A: and it's even worse because like tomorrow's my twenty first wedding anniversary so i mean i knew i was making myself sick because my husband's in florida and i'm here 

157.84 159.77 B: oh my gosh 

159.12 162.78 A: and i went down and spent the twentieth with him last year 

162.84 166.96 A: but this year i said you know i just hate to use a week's vacation in january 

167.18 169.73 B: yet what better time with this weather 

169.47 175.27 A: well yeah but then it makes the rest of the year when you only have one week seem to go forever 

175.31 176.67 B: oh 

176.20 178.53 A: yeah know what i mean so it's like 

178.80 180.53 A: [sigh] this weather it's just 

181.04 183.85 A: it's i i know that part of it is mental 

184.18 189.46 B: well i don't i really believe this winter weather has been 

189.71 193.11 B: uh the worst we've had in a long time 

193.22 202.75 A: well you know that's last year i kept s- you know and be- i've been south for twelve years and when i i kept telling my daughter i can take the cold i can't take the snow 

203.06 204.43 B: [laughter] 

203.60 211.96 A: you know 'cause i i didn't want to drive in it well i was lucky i found an apartment three less than four miles from where i work so i don't have to drive on the snow 

211.90 226.58 A: so now i think [laughter] i've mastered that now i you know and they keep the roads clean now i think that the weather is making me just feel depressed and sick and you know 'cause you go to work you go to the grocery store you come home and you stay inside you don't do anything else 

226.22 231.77 B: well you know that is true the weather does have an emotional strain on us 

232.16 233.37 B: i think 

233.09 237.11 A: oh i believe that a hundred and ten percent because i've never 

237.29 238.22 A: been 

238.74 241.98 A: well i mean down south you don't have the cold but 

241.37 242.36 B: no 

241.99 249.56 A: uh i've been sicker and i feel worse and it's just i'm gener- generally depressed and the more depressed i get then the worse i feel 

249.14 260.56 B: [laughter] yeah i i've noticed though that this winter the weather has been severely cold uh the snow i can handle i think it's pretty when it first comes 

260.27 261.27 A: uh-huh 

261.60 264.23 B: but this coldness it 

265.06 265.94 A: well 

265.09 269.80 B: it it's like a bitter cold it goes right to your bones 

269.22 275.03 A: yeah and i know i shouldn't smoke but i do [laughter] and we have to go outside to smoke 

272.54 273.54 B: oh do you 

274.91 276.58 B: oh 

276.20 278.84 A: do you know how cold it was today 

278.06 281.83 B: [laughter] uh-huh how far 

279.39 282.77 A: [laughter] i that might be part of the reason i'm sick 

282.64 286.29 B: [laughter] where in ohio do you live um 

286.09 287.22 A: euclid 

287.31 288.30 B: oh 

288.01 289.63 A: yeah i'm not that far from you 

289.28 290.56 B: no 

290.59 293.81 B: so yeah your weather is basically like ours 

293.28 299.05 A: mhm but like i said i when i lived up here before i lived right in the middle of the snow belt and you know 

294.36 295.33 B: yeah 

299.16 308.06 A: and i had to drive twenty miles to work and well you talk about get being sick i mean i took a lot of sick days because just the idea of going out into the weather 

307.68 310.61 B: (( it would affect you mhm )) 

308.32 310.64 A: it would make me s- would make me sick 

311.09 313.90 B: yeah yes it would 

313.29 322.97 A: yeah but you know and they're they're saying snow again this weekend and that makes me think oh my god i'll have a cold and you know it's just it's ridiculous [laughter] 

314.77 315.74 B: but 

323.10 326.84 B: it it's funny because rain is also depressing 

326.86 327.93 A: oh yeah 

327.86 330.49 B: (( i think i'd rather that i have it snow )) 

330.78 334.86 B: because to me when you're inside looking out it's so pretty 

334.70 335.82 A: that's true 

335.69 338.68 B: it's so white and clean and 

338.96 341.92 B: l- like purifies the air [mn] 

341.84 354.19 A: well you know i think part of the reason i make myself sick is and i did it more so last year i'm on a second you know one of the things i had to find a safe place before my husband would let me stay he comes up for like five months out of the year 

354.25 366.82 A: and uh i had to find a place that was safe and everything so i face a parking lot and i can see you know the babbitt road which takes me up to work and i'll wake up five or six times during the night to look out when they're predicting snow 

366.39 367.91 B: oh yeah 

367.59 369.35 A: so that you know and then 

369.36 376.52 A: i think you know if you don't get your rest you're gonna be sick and feel bad and everything and and that doesn't help anything 

376.30 383.68 B: no it doesn't i i don't work uh my husband's on disability he just had a 

383.88 386.74 B: a heart thing and so 

386.24 387.45 A: i'm sorry 

387.14 392.17 B: oh no no he needed it and he got it and that's good 

392.48 393.68 B: but [mn] 

393.93 397.18 B: i look when they like you said they predict snow 

397.23 405.65 B: and i'm thinking oh the sidewalk has to be shoveled the truck has to be brushed off how much snow are we getting [laughter] 

405.57 407.27 A: yeah and i mean that 

405.78 406.52 B: (( you know )) 

407.36 420.31 A: i i really believe that depression and illness go hand in hand and i mean i'm on an antidepressant [laughter] [sigh] i mean who figures cancer my husband's an alcoholic and i'm on an antidepressant and i mean who'd ever figure 

419.95 421.95 B: wow [laughter] 

420.48 423.39 A: [laughter] but but you know 

423.46 424.78 A: (( [mn] sometimes )) 

424.79 431.15 A: that even doesn't help i mean i get depressed and when i get depressed i get sick and then i get more depressed 'cause i'm sick [laughter] 

430.44 435.66 B: well you know that's funny because they they're thinking about putting my husband on one 

435.71 440.71 B: he hasn't worked in phew what five six seven years now 

440.74 442.54 B: because of his heart 

442.82 449.94 B: and m- he in fact he he got the heart uh it's the mitral valve and some other stuff done 

450.13 455.28 B: replaced and he thought he'd be feeling so much better 

456.29 459.39 B: and he's not and he's not i mean 

460.07 465.97 B: [sigh] i guess that was part of the problem but he still has other problems and they're trying to figure out what 

466.05 467.65 B: so he's depressed 

468.12 472.61 A: oh [mn] the antidepressants they gave them to me because i can't s- i couldn't sleep 

472.35 474.82 B: uh-huh no he can't either 

473.00 473.92 A: i mean 

474.38 475.36 A: okay 

475.86 479.51 A: for god's sakes tell him it's wonderful i mean i 

479.48 491.65 A: oh actually i got to go take one i i sometimes this is my first call because i just signed up with it [laughter] um well you know i at eight o'clock i'm supposed to take my pills so that i can go to sleep around eleven 

484.04 485.97 B: mine too [laughter] 

491.92 493.26 A: and um 

493.32 502.00 A: they they gave me you know they started me off on like a twenty five milligram or fifty and i'm now up to a hundred but it's been like seven years and um 

500.85 501.93 B: oh 

502.07 503.47 A: they said 

503.62 506.30 A: that uh it's not habit forming 

506.45 512.43 A: and it makes it makes a major difference like as when i i get sick but that's just you know tiredness and everything 

511.74 513.02 B: oh yeah 

512.69 514.83 A: but these help a lot 

515.26 517.16 A: [mn] tell him 

516.21 521.34 B: yeah yeah it's up to the heart doctor whether or not he can take 'em 

521.07 524.84 A: oh well i would i would tell him definitely definitely 

523.59 528.06 B: and i've i've noticed the difference with weather in him too 

528.41 529.45 A: yeah 

529.25 530.95 B: i you know it 

530.98 534.35 B: it i know rain depresses me 

534.72 543.06 B: i don't know why but rain does but [mn] when it snows i think it's beautiful as long as i don't have to go out 

542.53 554.03 A: well that's what it i always say you know let it snow i- it's and my parking lot um they plough it in the morning but i mean [mn] when i wake up and i look out at night and there's snow on it it's wonderful but it's it's 

553.03 554.78 B: yeah isn't it beautiful 

554.66 558.64 A: [mn] well you know w- um i think last year 

558.85 560.90 A: here it only snowed like 

560.96 564.31 A: twice i mean enough to to be on the ground 

563.74 564.86 B: mhm 

564.53 573.62 A: and uh i mean 'cause where where i am i don't know why i don't get it my my daughter's twenty five miles away with my two granddaughters and her husband and um 

573.85 577.97 A: [lipsmack] they'll get two feet and i'll be lucky if i have a sprinkling 

578.14 579.26 B: oh 

579.05 585.24 A: so i you know that was one of the things you know [mn] i wanted to be close to work and everything 

585.27 590.46 A: because of the snow and i know that i do have a tendency to get sick easy 

590.73 596.77 A: um you know sinuses earaches um sore throat the whole works 

593.99 595.11 B: mm 

596.81 598.22 B: wow 

597.62 599.95 A: an- and then that's why like i said when i went south i would
