57.12 60.06 A: and let's see i like to help my wife with cooking stir-fry 

62.71 64.30 A: hm other things to cook 

64.49 70.54 A: well actually about a year ago i guess this fits under cooking ah my wife and i canned about one hundred peaches 

67.30 68.12 B: oh my gosh 

69.52 70.07 B: wow 

71.28 72.17 A: so that was a lot of fun 

73.76 77.82 A: and that was back when our little daughter was too young to walk yet so she laid on the floor while we did that 

74.11 78.28 B: wow i've never done canning myself 

79.85 80.44 B: is it really 

81.00 85.11 B: i know my grandmother and my mother used to do it and i would sort of sit in and watch them 

82.05 83.04 A: it's a blast 

83.61 84.16 A: yeah 

85.72 89.98 B: do this labor of love but i was never really it seemed too time consuming to me 

90.56 94.06 B: but i guess the product is much better than what you can buy in a grocery store 

95.40 95.80 B: yeah 

97.49 98.53 A: yeah it's surprising 

99.21 99.69 B: yeah 

99.45 102.32 A: even without knowing too much about canning you end up with something pretty good 

100.36 104.39 B: so in the place where you live now are there lots of different kinds of ethnic cuisines and restaurants 

108.24 109.92 A: uh quite a few not 

110.27 112.73 A: not that many we're in ah the middle of missouri 

111.58 111.93 B: um 

113.06 115.79 B: oh i was just going to say i'm in northwestern pennsylvania so 

113.70 114.20 A: so 

114.70 115.33 A: what there is 

115.49 116.03 A: oh sorry 

116.24 120.42 B: uh we're in kind of sm- small rural area so immediately there's not that many 

118.57 118.99 A: uh-huh 

120.88 124.12 B: different types of restaurants but within you know an hours drive 

124.36 125.17 B: we've got quite a 

125.29 126.14 B: variety so 

127.36 132.85 B: yeah i think my ah response to the question of eating out or eating at home is it all depends on time 

129.70 130.47 A: i would imagine 

133.31 137.51 B: if i have time to cook i do but if i don't then eating out is a nice break 

138.03 138.52 A: mhm 

139.41 140.08 B: so 

140.35 144.79 B: um and i actually talking about making bread i made pizza tonight for supper 

145.08 146.19 B: homemade pizza yeah so 

146.45 147.80 B: i was trying to use up some ah 

148.10 148.69 A: oh really 

148.42 150.58 B: some yeast that i had that was going out of code and 

151.00 152.68 B: other stuff so 

152.88 156.13 B: i do like baking bread myself too but i don't do you have a bread machine 

157.24 157.93 B: you just make it 

158.37 159.74 B: from scratch completely by hand 

159.37 160.24 A: no 

160.37 160.85 B: yeah 

162.71 163.23 B: yeah 

163.09 163.71 A: yeah 

163.55 163.96 B: yeah 

164.16 166.26 A: when i when i have time to do it 

166.78 167.32 B: oh really 

167.63 169.95 A: yeah i never had good luck with a pizza crust though 

170.61 173.71 A: yeah it it either falls or rises too much or 

170.75 171.28 B: huh 

174.16 177.68 B: yeah well um i don't know sometimes i- 

176.34 177.60 A: i don't know what i do wrong 

177.91 184.09 B: well i'm sure that you always i'm if you're a bread baker you know about yeast so i'm sure you would know if the yeast proofs or not 

185.83 190.05 B: um besides that i don't know sometimes the type of flour that you use can be very 

187.84 188.26 A: yeah 

190.56 196.72 B: uh helpful or unhelpful depending on the kind of crust that you want i always use unbleached and um 

198.23 199.60 B: ah gold medal 

199.97 203.63 B: ah gold medal unbleached tends to work the best for me for pizza cru- 

203.79 204.66 B: for pizza crust 

204.89 206.08 B: for baking in general 

206.17 206.50 A: hm 

209.68 213.20 A: and i don't know if i do you bake it before you put all the toppings on 

210.10 213.53 B: no no well i don't um i there's a there's a way that you can do pizza 

213.65 216.11 B: like that but um i think to 

216.29 219.75 B: for the optimum kind of pizza you just you know roll it out um 

220.37 224.89 B: and i tend to make something called pizza bianco which is basically white pizza instead of having a red sauce 

225.42 228.31 B: um you make like a garlic ah oil sauce instead 

227.01 227.69 A: oh yeah 

228.95 232.22 B: and ah it it's a better crust that way it gets a lot more crispy 

235.36 236.10 B: oh okay yeah 

235.72 238.60 A: yeah i've had that ah down in athens georgia 

236.34 236.74 B: yeah 

238.27 241.92 B: so i wonder how long these calls are supposed to go on 

242.56 243.68 B: oh really okay wow 

244.24 246.20 A: i don't know i think they said ten minutes 

247.01 251.20 A: the last one i was home to (( )) my phone died in the middle of the call 

247.45 248.52 B: oh wow 

248.66 249.14 B: wow 

249.70 253.06 B: um okay well i guess we're supposed to keep on talking about food um 

255.51 261.15 B: ah let's see i tend to like japanese cuisine quite a bit i'm a big fan of sushi 

255.75 258.80 A: yeah let's see ah so what is your favorite kind of food to eat 

261.74 262.27 B: my (( )) 

261.95 262.50 A: uh-huh 

262.92 263.32 B: i'm sorry 

264.89 265.81 A: and since you're in 

266.02 266.53 A: oh sorry 

266.88 270.15 A: i was just going to say since you're near the coast you can actually probably get pretty good sushi 

271.78 273.65 A: oh i thought you said eastern (( )) 

283.17 283.78 A: oh wow 

283.82 286.26 B: so besides japanese i really like mexican 

285.27 285.80 A: i bet 

286.76 289.35 B: um i like italian although it's kind of 

290.65 293.04 B: i don't know ah hard to get really good authentic italian 

294.19 295.93 B: um let's see 

296.15 299.30 B: i had quite a bit of thai food in hawaii i like thai 

300.63 302.56 B: i do yeah i do like spicy stuff 

302.57 304.09 A: you must like spicy stuff then 

302.88 306.33 B: i do um my husband doesn't like spicy stuff but um 

306.81 307.96 B: you know you can always sort of 

308.71 309.75 B: tone it down a little bit 

310.65 314.76 B: add stuff to make it spicier or not add stuff to make it less spicy 

318.68 320.76 A: yeah for christmas i got my brother (( )) 

320.70 321.62 B: oh wow 

321.14 324.36 A: hot sauce it's so hot they have to call it a food additive 

322.03 322.89 B: the kind where you have t- 

323.02 325.69 B: practically have to sign a release form or whatever so 

325.90 326.31 B: yeah 

326.85 333.49 B: i've always wondered if those were actually if you could actually eat them and if they had any flavor you know or if they were just simply so hot that 

328.46 329.40 A: right hm 

333.63 335.43 B: you know they just sort of gave you ah 

335.84 338.79 B: an endorphin rush and that was about it 

340.00 340.79 B: oh okay 

340.41 344.37 A: he says this one has pretty good flavor when you dilute it 

340.93 341.38 B: yeah 

344.49 345.02 B: yeah 

344.91 348.21 A: you know what it's in a whole bowl of or whole pot of chili or something it's pretty good 

345.58 348.05 B: do you um since you're a home ah 

348.30 352.12 B: bread baker do you also like to do you have like a garden where you have vegetables or 

352.28 355.25 B: you know spices herbs anything that you grow yourself 

357.96 358.33 B: yeah 

358.70 360.05 B: oh 

359.02 362.06 A: ah last year we tried to grow some tomatoes and it didn't go that well 

360.84 361.37 B: yeah 

361.55 365.41 B: you got to have sun for tomatoes that's for sure and for peppers actually too if you're a pepper 

362.97 364.71 A: we didn't have enough sun so 

365.83 366.55 B: pepper person 

366.62 367.29 A: and 

369.84 374.18 A: yeah i wouldn't mind growing some peppers that was actually we tried to grow some of those too and something kept eating them 

370.95 377.30 B: oh wow hopefully not your two year old daughter yeah 

377.96 385.20 B: um well actually ha- ah used to have a garden but i don't really have time to do it any longer so i end up ah trying to 

378.73 379.46 A: no 

379.62 380.02 A: no 

385.69 386.20 B: ah 

386.88 393.97 B: get some off of you know coworkers or people who have gardens i really like fresh vegetables what you can get in the grocery store is not nearly as good so 

394.79 395.23 B: um 

396.96 397.48 A: yeah 

397.53 399.67 B: oh okay yeah that makes a big difference then 

398.07 401.07 A: yeah we've got a good farmers market that runs near our house here 

403.07 405.41 A: yeah you can actually get some of those um 

404.10 404.52 B: yeah 

405.72 407.41 A: some of those heritage tomatoes 

405.88 407.08 B: yeah yeah 

407.59 411.58 B: they kind of um are really ugly in terms of how they look but they taste fantastic 

408.25 409.47 A: those are kind of interesting 

412.25 412.82 B: yeah 

414.74 415.25 B: yeah 

414.95 415.47 A: yeah 

415.46 415.90 B: yeah 

415.60 418.02 A: um there's some really bizarre colors out there 

417.43 421.80 B: um let's see so what's the most unusual kind of food you've ever had 

423.37 425.09 B: for you know dinner or 

425.19 426.20 B: ingredient or 

425.67 426.82 A: hm 

426.50 427.00 B: whatever 

429.82 430.08 A: i 

430.42 433.51 A: i guess in terms of things most people don't eat squirrel 

430.47 431.01 B: oh yeah 

433.43 433.77 B: yeah 

434.38 435.46 B: yeah i've actually had it 

434.76 437.70 A: i well i guess a lot of people probably eat squirrel at some point or other but 

436.52 440.23 B: when i was growing up my brother and father both were big hunters so 

442.70 443.21 B: yeah 

443.53 450.34 B: i think whenever i tasted it it's just sort of was kind of greasy and kind of gamy tasting so it didn't really appeal to me very much but ah 

443.88 445.95 A: it's yeah if you cook it long enough it's not bad 

450.84 458.39 B: you know it was sort of like oh poor little squirrel my brother was mean and kept dangling the squirrel's tail in front of me and 

458.51 461.29 B: pestering me so that probably had something to do with the experience 

463.24 463.94 B: but um 

465.40 467.18 B: um let's see 

466.40 468.87 A: and uh well how about you what odd things have you had 

467.59 468.73 B: probably 

470.17 470.88 B: let's see 

472.96 476.50 B: um i'm sure that there must have been i used to teach um 

477.01 478.81 B: non native speakers of english 

479.39 480.00 B: ah 

480.46 483.56 B: la- ah language courses at purdue university and 

484.23 484.49 B: um 

484.62 488.62 B: our classes would have like (( )) where everybody you know from different countries would bring food 

486.15 486.64 A: uh-huh 

489.25 492.01 B: and i'm sure there must have been something that someone brought 

492.61 495.01 B: that was unusual but i can't think right now 

495.85 499.12 B: um so off the top of my head probably some kind of sushi 

499.44 499.92 B: um 

501.09 503.54 B: there are a couple of ah row dishes that are 

503.72 506.12 B: a little odd tasting um 

506.65 508.89 B: i can't remember the the japanese term but they're sort of 

509.43 511.37 B: about the size of tapioca 

511.77 514.53 B: and um when you eat them they sort of pop against your tongue 

515.19 520.55 B: and ah so it's kind of a weird sensation if you're not in to you know different textures like my husband won't even touch it 

517.81 518.46 A: ooh 

520.89 524.64 B: the ones that are smaller don't really do that the ones that are bigger though have a little pop when you 

525.16 526.26 B: when you know eat them 

526.60 527.36 B: um 

528.36 532.65 B: but let's see la- actually last week i tried a couple of things i never had before one was called 

529.85 531.01 A: that's pretty strange 

533.27 534.03 B: (( )) 

534.15 536.80 B: (( )) i think anyway it was some sort of um 

538.38 547.39 B: some sort of clam a surf clam or something and it was like white with a purple tip and it looked weird and i actually tasted it it just tasted sort of a little chewy and 

544.06 544.62 A: ooh 

548.10 552.24 B: i don't know not really fishy as much as just mo- more texture than taste 

552.40 552.96 B: i guess 

553.69 554.82 B: um but i really like 

554.92 557.48 B: you know the other kinds of traditional sushi salmon 

556.38 556.75 A: hm 

557.92 558.54 B: tuna 

559.24 560.71 B: um i really like 

560.81 562.15 B: ah yellow tail 

562.80 563.48 B: um
