329.15 330.76 A: [laughter] 

330.24 333.90 B: i don't know probably because he's been sick a lot he always gets sick 

334.38 348.64 B: but i don't know i don't really get too sick only usually the change of season is what'll bring it on like if it's a real drastic change or if i'll go visit my cousin in virginia and then i'll come back then i'll get sick when i come back 'cause i'm not used to their kind of i 

341.35 342.30 A: right

348.87 350.20 B: (( have to get used to )) 

352.17 353.33 B: mhm 

352.73 362.16 A: but it's because the seasons are getting pushed so far back that this is basically november because we didn't even start getting snow until the beginning of the month 

356.47 357.77 B: (( oh )) 

362.13 363.29 B: oh 

362.59 365.65 A: and we usually have snow like the end of november 

365.28 366.81 B: (( wow )) 

366.33 368.68 A: so yeah it's getting pushed back 

367.00 368.59 B: (( do you get a lot of snow ))

370.94 376.06 A: not right now no we we haven't really gotten too much snow yet 

376.15 379.83 B: but i heard this is supposed to be like one of the coldest winters ever 

379.78 391.15 A: well that's what i always talk about is that it's getting pushed so far back that instead of summer being in like july and august winter's going to be in july and august and summer's gonna be in january 

380.26 381.92 B: for like snow places 

391.04 392.44 B: oh gosh 

391.84 397.47 A: yeah it's going to be totally the opposite way because we have we have uh winter so late 

393.25 395.25 B: (( yeah everything's going to be like ))

400.49 403.73 A: that's the only time i ever get sick is in winter 

403.22 414.83 B: oh i used to get that every winter i used to get because i had asthma really bad when i was younger and i used to get bronchial asthma and i'd have the bad cough and the asthma all at once 

414.72 415.78 A: (( ugh )) 

415.32 419.86 B: and then it would just be [laughter] so bad i had to go get like steroid inhalers and

420.07 422.40 B: (( [laughter] like gi- i don't know )) 

422.58 426.02 B: and i gained a lot of weight because of my inhalers were steroids [laughter] 

422.67 423.60 A: (( [cough] )) 

426.49 428.23 B: (( and so it was kind of bad but ))
