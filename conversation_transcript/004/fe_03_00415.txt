413.15 418.16 B: i don't know what i'd do with two i don't know how to to help two kids interact 

418.07 419.69 A: they they just do 

420.09 433.13 A: i mean it g- the distance between myse- i have two sisters and the distance between myself and my younger sister is ten years so by the time i was eight she was actually married and out of the house so for intents and purposes i was an only child 

422.84 423.78 B: mhm 

425.60 426.87 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

432.49 433.38 B: (( yeah [noise] ))

446.10 447.22 B: oh okay 

446.90 450.43 A: um but i mean they just they they get a- they 

450.47 453.19 A: interact the way they're gonna interact you know it's 

451.66 459.95 B: mhm but i i think you you need to you need [noise] to know [noise] what you can handle and what you can't handle and for me one child was it i knew my limits 

459.39 460.29 A: uh-huh 

460.13 465.52 B: i have a good friend who has two kids and rues the day she had the second one and i don't think that's healthy 

465.15 467.55 A: really how come 

465.79 466.74 B: yeah 

467.98 469.55 B: why don't i think it's healthy 

468.72 471.72 A: no no no how come she is is 

471.17 475.09 B: she only wanted one child and her husband pushed for two 

475.25 479.26 B: and that [noise] was the most unhappy baby i've ever seen 

478.87 480.30 A: really 

479.38 486.30 B: and i'm s- i think they they can feel it they can sense it now that he's older ah you know it seems to be fine but at the time 

486.51 490.41 A: [mn] now you see th- this kind of goes back to something you said about divorces i mean 

490.24 497.45 A: the divorces are always tough on the kids what makes it even worse is the inability of of adults to accept their place as adults 

496.96 497.79 B: right 

497.22 506.07 A: and [noise] you know she she carried this baby for nine months and whether she really wanted to or not you know you pull yourself up by the bootstraps and you say okay this is what i gotta deal with 

505.75 506.79 B: right 

506.21 508.79 A: and you you do it with a smile on your face 

508.57 512.37 B: some people can and some people can't this couple is divorced now [noise] 

511.76 514.72 A: yeah maybe because fo the ed- does she have the kids 

514.36 523.21 B: ah they actually worked out a very good arrangement they live within a mile of each other and they do half time and half time 

520.62 521.66 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

523.91 527.72 B: and the kids seem to like it they can bike back and forth between the homes 

527.08 532.27 A: sure now see that works out the best unless this guy or she gets a transfer or something like that how old are the kids 

532.10 536.22 B: ah let's see one is one is thirteen one is ten 

536.07 541.38 A: all right so they're kind of up there then and and and they waited a while before they got divorced 

537.42 538.42 B: right 

541.19 545.35 B: yeah i think they were married for maybe twelve twelve thirteen 

545.41 548.13 B: years before they they were divorced so 

546.01 551.90 A: yeah yeah 'cause i was married almost seven but i had known my wife 

552.20 558.49 A: since i was seventeen we were we were high school sweethearts so i guess i mean pretty much i i've known her half my life 

553.46 554.37 B: okay 

558.02 560.22 B: right and i think that's important 

558.50 562.74 A: yeah um but 

561.18 563.94 B: i think you have to be a friend before you can be a lover 

565.01 575.86 A: yeah [mn] sometimes i think it it it it can work in a variety of ways i mean this woman that i i ended a relationship with we still consider each other soul mates 

575.48 576.30 B: mhm 

575.80 587.54 A: and we are we are very good friends she calls me all the time um [sigh] but we're not getting married you know it it works the way it works and i think it changes when you're older too i mean i'm like forty seven 

581.83 582.68 B: right 

587.66 590.97 B: right [laughter] your priorities change 

588.08 589.86 A: you know and 

590.41 599.89 A: yeah and and the just the way you look at things i mean believe me i would be more than happy to ah i'm a great fan of monogamy and and marri-
