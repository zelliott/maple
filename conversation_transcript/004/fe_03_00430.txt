119.05 119.58 A: uh-huh 

119.79 125.11 B: but as my parents getting older i'm getting a lot more of the feeling about family that 

125.23 130.59 B: this is the only family i have and i have to be there for them and uh

140.01 140.67 A: uh-huh 

140.43 143.43 B: but i'm thinking about that now that

157.68 159.02 B: um i did 

159.11 160.06 A: oh yourself 

160.03 160.39 B: yeah 

162.60 165.67 A: because my family eh spent lot of money 

166.15 168.56 A: on my school so 

168.83 170.59 A: so and uh i think 

171.42 176.48 A: because i i went to an ivy league university and uh i think they spend spent a lot 

174.31 175.17 B: oh which one 

176.58 177.17 A: uh 

177.41 180.95 A: i think they spent all of their money 

181.20 182.54 A: on me so 

182.31 184.18 B: which one did you go to 

183.68 184.21 A: yale 

184.28 187.04 B: really my best friend from college went to yale 

185.01 185.41 A: yeah 

187.17 187.90 A: oh really 

187.60 190.29 B: she went to the theater program she got her masters 

191.10 191.95 B: there 

192.00 198.19 A: so so i think it's time for me to you know to return this 

198.42 198.95 B: yes 

201.42 203.21 A: and uh they miss me a lot 

203.65 204.23 B: oh yes 

204.33 205.21 B: well 

204.45 205.78 A: yeah i i (( )) 

205.92 208.94 A: went back home this uh some uh i think 

209.35 209.95 A: and uh 

210.81 211.56 A: two months of 

211.84 213.71 A: two months ago and uh 

213.84 216.84 A: when i when i left they were sad 

217.94 218.26 A: yeah 

220.14 222.69 B: so when i see my parents they 

223.01 225.97 B: my dad my father was sad to see me go 

226.43 226.89 A: uh-huh 

226.98 232.90 B: my mother and i never really got along we never got along well to begin with so 

233.08 234.22 B: it's more with like 

234.58 236.02 B: yeah well i'll see you whenever 

236.14 236.45 B: but 

237.22 240.54 B: they do tell me they love me which is something they didn't always do 

241.55 241.99 A: yes 

241.66 245.34 B: and i think part of it is also because my grandparents are you know 

245.94 255.53 B: my one of my grandparents is ninety five and the other one is eighty eight and so they're seeing their parents die grow old and die too and i think they're worried about 

249.12 249.64 A: uh 

256.02 257.17 B: what's going to become of them 

257.31 258.83 B: and then i i wouldn't you know 

259.18 259.98 B: let them 

261.09 262.44 B: i wouldn't leave them alone 

262.99 263.91 B: but they're also 

264.21 267.86 B: i can't spend any more then two days with them at a time 

275.45 276.37 A: i think 

276.87 282.91 A: you you are you are at age to uh people people have their own family i think 

284.09 284.86 A: i don't know 

285.85 287.73 A: maybe you can understand them 

288.59 291.17 A: uh better then younger people 

292.69 293.53 B: you mean how 

294.20 297.11 B: important how how uh precious they can be 

296.83 297.39 A: yeah 

297.74 300.77 B: yeah two years ago my father fell off the roof 

301.39 303.61 B: of the of his house and 

303.74 304.85 B: he nearly died 

305.45 306.09 A: oh 

305.57 307.47 B: and actually that uh 

307.95 310.75 B: that actually improved my family relationship 

311.02 311.53 A: uh-huh 

311.64 318.50 B: because i guess we realized how important we really were to one another even though we can't be in the same room for really long without getting 

315.63 316.08 A: yeah 

320.14 320.67 B: um 

321.51 322.39 B: we still 

322.64 328.06 B: found that we were important but i i don't just consider my family my parents and my 

328.20 328.62 B: and 

329.41 331.76 B: cousins i consider my family my friends 

332.05 332.62 A: yeah 

334.34 335.95 A: uh 

336.43 337.51 A: so are you are you 

338.22 340.68 A: uh live far from your home 

341.70 344.13 B: in chica- it's about three hundred miles away 

341.71 342.24 A: from 

344.41 346.56 A: um okay oh so you are in 

346.67 346.95 A: in 

347.15 348.26 A: chicago right now 

348.23 350.09 B: no i'm in louisville kentucky 

350.15 350.78 A: oh okay 

351.09 351.35 B: it 

351.49 352.20 B: um 

352.74 356.00 B: if you go down i. sixty five through indiana 

356.48 361.77 B: as soon as you get to the southern border of indiana and cross over that's where that's where louisville kentucky is 

363.15 367.25 B: so it's about an hour by plane or six hours by car 

367.36 369.15 B: it's it's just far enough 

370.00 372.04 B: um i always though if i didn't have 

372.79 377.53 B: family parents i would move to california i would move to san francisco 

377.66 378.51 B: but then 

378.95 380.68 B: if i need to get home right away 

381.10 384.08 B: that's a lot more expensive and a lot more time consuming 

384.54 384.96 A: yeah 

385.62 386.60 A: are they retired 

386.98 387.35 B: no 

388.89 398.67 B: no um my mother's currently unemployed and my father uh he's going to be sixty three no sixty two next month 

398.80 400.66 B: and he's still working 

401.95 408.44 B: yeah they lost a lot of their retirement in the stock market he thought he was going to be retiring this year but he's not going to be able to 

408.85 409.33 A: uh-huh 

409.86 415.21 B: so another reason i have to stick around because i'll probably end up supporting them one day 

416.02 416.53 A: yeah

419.68 421.13 B: yes
