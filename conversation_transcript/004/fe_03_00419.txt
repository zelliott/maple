194.96 195.51 A: syndrome 

195.73 197.90 B: and that was the cause of the divorce 

198.08 202.65 A: yeah um my dad would make comments about it 

202.87 203.82 A: to my mother 

204.54 208.34 A: um kind of making it seem that it was her fault 

208.40 209.53 B: oh 

208.53 209.87 A: that my sister died 

210.90 212.42 A: and she just 

212.76 214.40 A: got really depressed about it 

214.56 215.37 A: and um 

215.88 217.64 A: ended up leaving him and 

218.26 218.97 A: um 

219.43 221.27 A: we kind of me and my brother 

221.92 223.42 A: would visit him off and on 

223.63 224.75 A: over the years but 

225.07 225.70 A: he a 

226.56 232.86 A: decided he didn't want to have anything to do with us for the past some years m- 

232.32 232.99 B: oh 

233.01 234.52 A: he remarried 

233.16 233.58 B: so 

234.65 234.95 B: oh 

235.63 236.43 A: um 

238.04 241.59 B: so in that way we'r- we are similar in that were our fathers are 

242.05 242.83 B: somewhat distant 

243.06 243.68 A: right 

244.65 248.68 A: so my mom uh also remarried but 

249.85 254.77 A: her husband's kind of more of the middle-aged man trying to uh 

256.22 256.63 A: uh 

257.25 260.30 A: play a role of a teenager 

260.08 260.90 B: oh 

260.97 262.10 A: so he he 

262.32 267.79 A: tries to go out of his way to you know be cool with all of the teenagers in the house 

268.16 268.85 A: and 

269.11 271.38 A: i think that's more annoying then someone 

271.65 274.34 A: just trying to play the father role 

274.55 276.15 B: so you don't feel like he's your father 

276.27 280.72 A: no i mean he's a nice guy and i get along with him fine it's just 

281.35 281.72 A: he 

281.90 282.94 A: he takes 

283.13 285.48 A: a lot of time and effort trying to 

285.80 286.66 A: i guess um 

288.66 291.26 A: i'm sorry i'm i had a loss for words 

291.78 292.24 A: i've 

292.30 293.26 B: he he 

292.73 294.30 A: trying to relate to us

298.44 299.60 A: yeah it's jus- i- 

299.72 304.91 A: it annoys my mom to because she's trying to you know tell him you're almost forty 

300.03 300.70 B: at least he 

305.35 308.03 A: and you're acting like my children 

306.75 311.67 B: talk about that my my boyfriend is is almost forty and sometimes i feel he's like a kid 

312.40 315.77 A: maybe it's just something about that age 

312.92 313.41 B: true 

316.45 320.07 B: i don't know what the problem is and he does play with kids very well 

320.34 320.89 A: yeah
