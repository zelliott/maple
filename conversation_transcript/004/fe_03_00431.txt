86.22 87.02 A: oh good 

90.11 100.57 B: we don't even say hello any more when we pick up the phone or you know we we we bicker like we're in family and it just feels like some kind of level beyond

122.52 122.97 B: really 

123.13 123.57 A: yeah 

123.77 126.71 B: so it it's kind of a place of refuge or comfort or 

126.60 127.58 A: i think so 

127.76 128.70 A: i think so 

128.90 129.33 B: because that's 

128.92 129.46 A: how -bout (( ch- )) 

129.71 130.16 B: go ahead 

130.49 134.96 A: no i was i was just going to ask do you have a a friend like that or would you go to family 

135.34 136.51 B: well 

138.07 141.11 B: i guess for a lot of things i would go to 

141.61 145.77 B: uh a couple of different friends that i have one in particular is 

146.95 150.16 B: he's kind of like family and and it's weird because he's 

151.60 155.13 B: he's like family not only because we're very close and because 

155.86 156.50 B: his 

156.63 158.91 B: his home is a place of comfort but also 

159.01 164.28 B: because i was kind of joking about it a moment ago but it's true we often 

164.59 167.08 B: bicker like family and we 

166.04 166.54 A: mhm 

167.63 173.83 B: we get (( utch )) under each other's skin and can push each other's buttons in a way that i've only experienced with family 

173.86 174.40 A: mhm 

174.31 184.94 B: um and so yeah i mean and it and it's weird i don't know if it's my upbringing -cause i have i i have a pretty small family and my parents and i are very close but i don't know my my my house 

185.06 194.34 B: when i grew up didn't have a tremendous amount of fighting but there was a you know there was bickering and yelling and that's just you know the kind of family i grew up with people argued and raised their voices and 

193.61 194.06 A: mhm 

194.57 197.93 B: and i don't know there's something comforting to me in that it's li- it's like it's real 

198.24 201.11 B: you know if uh uh uh i'm not necessarily comfortable 

201.43 202.08 B: um 

202.20 202.61 B: you know 

203.21 204.23 B: expressing 

204.76 206.81 B: those kind of feelings with a lot of people 

207.12 207.62 A: mhm 

207.39 212.15 B: and with this person i can and same with him you know we and can get annoyed and then you know we're fine 

212.36 215.87 B: you know twenty minutes later no harm no foul it's not a big deal 

215.39 216.08 A: exactly 

216.18 217.96 B: and and it's it's just 

218.10 221.51 B: yeah so i- it it's comforting but it's comforting in these weird ways too i guess 

221.47 225.27 A: yeah now is this someone you grew up with or someone met recently 

224.11 224.96 B: no it's 

225.60 226.90 B: someone i've known for about 

227.36 228.50 B: ten years maybe 

228.92 229.42 A: okay 

229.00 230.64 B: and we uh 

230.85 233.35 B: i don't know we just hit it off as friends and 

234.43 238.03 B: we've done a lot of different kinds of things together whether it be you know 

238.25 242.43 B: uh social things um we have mutual friends in common 

243.08 244.40 B: civic or political things 

244.86 254.10 B: we're both academics in different fields but we we do a lot of um you know we read each other's stuff and we talk about things together and we have 

262.54 262.90 A: mhm 

264.17 272.75 B: sharing and a lot of merging of our of what's in our heads to the point where some of the things are clearly you know community property basically and it really 

271.26 271.71 A: yes 

273.80 275.01 B: i don't know it just really 

275.48 277.05 B: produces this bonding feeling 

277.49 278.92 A: oh that's wonderful 

278.77 283.71 B: yeah it's kind of nice because i do have a very small family and so eh not many of us left 

279.92 280.36 A: yeah 

283.28 283.82 A: mhm 

283.96 284.37 B: um 

283.97 286.43 A: and it's it's wonderful that you have a friend 

286.63 296.89 A: that is that close to you that i mean if you have a small family and there's basically you and your parents at some point your parents will be gone and and you'll still have that bond 

296.85 297.48 B: exactly 

297.70 300.27 B: yeah you sound like you have a larger family is that wrong or 

300.38 306.24 A: oh we- actually i have a very large family but i've excluded the majority of them from my life 

306.39 306.83 B: oh yeah 

307.13 307.91 A: mhm 

307.63 308.82 B: my uh my 

308.99 309.64 B: my 

309.78 312.72 B: maternal grandmother's family was like that 

313.05 313.55 A: mhm 

313.21 319.06 B: that that they there were what nine of them and they had a lot of trouble getting along and there was a lot of that 

319.41 321.44 B: kind of thing that went went on with people not 

322.19 323.89 B: being a part of their each other's lives 

330.32 330.98 B: oh 

333.11 334.88 A: don't want that in my life i've seen 

335.30 341.45 A: you know the the turmoil that it's created and so when i had a child 

341.91 343.26 A: i made a a decision 

344.86 347.44 A: involve them in my life as long as they were sober 

347.74 350.76 B: oh yeah that that's really that's hard to do 

351.00 356.04 A: well it wasn't because i waited a long time to have a child 

353.13 353.51 B: really 

356.20 360.93 A: and alcohol had caused a great deal of disruption in my life 

361.45 362.09 A: and 

362.31 365.69 A: i did not want my child to grow up with those scars 

367.07 367.92 B: that makes sense 

368.10 374.51 A: yeah yeah it was you know i think you can end cycles um by conscious decisions 

375.23 375.77 A: um 

375.28 375.68 B: yeah 

377.01 377.96 A: so if 

377.46 381.78 B: i uh yeah i've more recently in my life i've had occasion to be 

382.19 385.55 B: relating to people who are in a relationship with someone who has 

385.71 387.35 B: that kind of problem and i it's 

388.95 390.10 B: yeah it's really um 

390.81 391.59 A: you can't win 

392.69 394.15 A: you you can't win 

396.78 397.35 B: not about 

398.03 402.90 B: whether someone's a good person or not or good intentions or anything it's just about the effects of the addiction period 

402.83 403.90 A: ex- exactly 

404.04 406.97 A: exactly um and i 

407.13 409.87 A: i've seen enough addiction that i 

410.61 418.22 A: although i understand that chemically it's supposed to be a disease i've seen just a series of bad choices 

418.64 419.03 B: sure 

419.08 422.31 A: and if you have that model in your life 

422.55 426.07 A: certainly it'll be easier to make bad choices and rationalize them 

426.23 426.73 B: sure 

427.49 428.78 B: and it it can't 

429.36 430.15 B: i'm sure that 

430.50 431.82 B: some folks are more 

432.94 437.68 B: you know biologically susceptible to that addiction than others but that doesn't that's not the whole thing 

437.88 438.42 A: exactl- 

438.10 442.21 B: you know i mean i'm sure there are people who are really susceptible who 

442.93 450.98 B: have kicked the habit or have just not gotten into it and people who aren't very susceptible at all and just do it enough where they get addicted too i think that that's 

450.52 450.89 A: mhm 

451.09 453.57 B: yeah i mean i i don't know there's just this real tendency to 

453.69 457.26 B: make everything biological these days and i just think that's only part of the story 

457.26 458.88 A: i agree with you completely 

459.32 461.87 B: yeah well that's a shame about your family but it seems like you've really 

462.82 463.11 A: oh 

462.84 463.55 B: carved out a 

463.75 465.27 B: a place for yourself where you 

465.41 466.00 B: you know you have 

465.53 466.98 A: i'm comfortable with it 

466.80 467.21 B: yeah 

467.21 473.95 A: i'm very comfortable with it um i have um a strong family unit with my husband and my daughter 

474.65 479.72 A: um and we're about to grow our family as my daughter's brought a partner into 

479.85 481.04 A: um our lives 

481.88 482.34 A: so 

482.03 482.70 B: that's nice 

482.84 484.11 A: yeah so 

483.83 484.54 B: that a new thing 

484.99 488.83 A: yeah well eh the partner's been around for awhile but 

489.28 490.60 A: you know we've uh 

490.87 493.31 A: made a conscious decision now that this is 

493.43 496.93 A: this is uh a person that our daughter has chosen 

497.12 497.57 B: mhm 

497.53 500.66 A: um to spend her time with and so 

500.87 501.63 A: um 

502.00 505.52 A: it would only separate our lives if we did not include her partner 

505.91 506.91 B: is this a female partner 

507.04 507.44 A: yes 

507.42 510.78 B: i figured well that's great i'm glad that you made that decision 

508.61 509.39 A: yeah yeah 

510.41 511.98 A: oh yeah it's it's 

512.32 513.19 A: so important 

513.65 515.48 A: i'm grateful that you know 

515.61 516.67 A: a very 

517.49 519.94 A: unusual world that we're living in today 

520.43 525.05 A: that our child and my husband feels the same way has the capacity to love 

525.36 526.97 A: and commit to another human being 

527.20 528.56 B: no that is that's wonderful 

528.70 529.10 A: yeah 

529.22 533.44 A: yeah it's uh you know you see so many people that live life alone 

533.86 534.36 B: yes 

534.15 535.25 A: and uh 

535.48 537.94 A: i'm i'm so grateful that she 

538.39 540.76 A: has welcomed another into her life to 

541.21 541.70 A: help her 

542.06 542.64 A: you know 

543.22 544.22 A: make it through each day 

544.44 546.69 B: yeah and be part of her family 

546.42 548.47 A: exactly it's so important 

548.41 550.48 B: so they've been together for awhile 

550.73 554.26 B: even though the partner is kind of relatively new to the your family is that 

554.72 556.44 A: well they've been together but 

556.54 557.27 A: um it 

557.56 559.63 A: she lived in another state 

559.49 560.03 B: mm

560.55 560.90 B: right 

567.75 568.38 A: and
