63.58 64.09 A: i mean 

64.49 64.95 A: you know 

65.37 69.11 A: they kind of stress it at the interviews well cause i'm going to work for a very conservative firm 

69.54 71.95 A: so it's a question you ask when you go on interviews you know like 

72.57 75.45 A: could this happen to me you know could i lose my job 

75.78 76.58 A: because of some 

76.71 79.03 A: something someone does three hundred miles away 

79.50 80.95 A: -ffiliated with the same company 

81.34 82.13 A: so um 

82.70 85.92 A: you know they said that they've always been very conservative my particular firm 

86.41 87.51 A: and they're going to continue to be 

88.08 89.73 A: and uh if you ever feel that you 

90.00 92.98 A: see anything you know inappropriate you should im- report it immediately 

93.53 96.65 A: to you know your manager or your partner something like that 

97.38 101.38 A: and personally i know my sister in-law's sister lost her job because she worked at anderson

118.45 118.89 A: uh-huh 

120.45 122.44 B: so i i just don't know what good it does 

122.77 126.94 B: i don't know i guess it depends on who you can report it too if you can go to the government and say hey i think the 

127.06 130.98 B: happening but you can't just report it to somebody in the company because it's not going to make any difference 

131.83 132.21 B: cause it's 

132.07 132.44 A: well 

132.49 135.75 B: it it goes so far and then that's it you know they'll check it out and then

163.45 166.08 B: dealings that have happened lately but i do know somebody 

166.43 171.46 B: there a couple of people that were involved in some smaller incidences you know smaller businesses that you know they just 

171.64 174.07 B: they lost everything that they had worked all their life for 

174.54 176.91 B: and i just think it's appalling that you know that (( they'd )) 

174.62 175.08 A: uh-huh 

178.00 179.27 B: (( )) does happen 

179.80 180.22 B: and that 

179.83 180.20 A: uh-huh 

180.43 182.38 B: you know there's really no way people can 

182.60 185.13 B: stop it unless the government's the one that steps in to do it 

186.16 186.56 A: yeah 

186.99 190.54 A: unless there's government rea- regulation this could happen again and it could effect 

190.88 192.76 A: thousands of people just like how it has 

192.94 193.27 B: right 

196.21 197.09 A: do you know if um 

197.30 201.07 A: there's going to be a little tone to let us know that our ten minutes are up or 

200.47 201.29 B: i don't know 

201.63 203.79 B: i don't know it was there a ten minute 

204.19 206.00 B: deadline i mean is that how it works 

206.21 206.61 B: see 

207.12 210.76 A: yeah cause this is my first call i just signed up for it today 

207.99 208.34 B: i don't 

210.58 213.12 B: yeah me too and so it's like i'm going like 

213.24 214.00 B: i thought you just 

214.16 216.69 B: answered questions because i had done this one other time and 

217.20 219.32 B: and you answered questions but it wasn't 

219.54 221.16 B: and it was like a group thing but it 

221.62 222.90 B: it was on-line 

223.96 225.69 B: and so people had to you know they would just 

225.94 226.97 B: put there input in 

227.25 228.03 B: you know like 

228.15 228.71 A: oh 

229.51 230.71 B: chat room type thing 

231.08 233.63 A: no i think the purpose of this study is just to a 

234.09 237.36 A: just to see how strangers interact with each other given a random topic 

237.20 237.93 B: okay 

237.94 239.89 A: so i think the topic randomly changes and 

240.36 241.95 A: fortunately we were dealt with a pretty 

244.08 244.66 A: a pretty 

244.79 246.33 A: i guess intense type of topic 

246.85 250.34 A: corporate scandal and government reactions and things (( like )) of that nature 

253.98 255.95 A: did you vote for someone who uh 

256.62 257.73 A: who heavily supported 

259.19 259.92 A: you know this type 

260.07 262.19 A: you know going after accountants and things of that nature 

264.18 267.76 B: well i you know that's really hard to say because it 

267.87 269.77 B: really come up more in the last 

270.07 271.62 B: um what year 

272.32 272.73 A: uh-huh 

273.67 276.20 B: um was anderson enron the first 

276.68 280.29 B: can't remember uh the the first major one was that really you know like 

280.95 286.15 B: really made you stop and think you know there were like i said there was a smaller one that somebody i knew was involved with but 

286.84 289.79 B: but nobody you know like not a major 

290.38 292.46 B: big business thing that you know you think 

293.17 295.71 B: wow they should've have everything covered you know and 

296.69 297.09 A: uh-huh 

297.26 299.22 B: and so i'm i mean i don't know really 

302.02 302.57 B: i mean 

302.91 309.22 B: i'm i'm not really aware of all of the steps that they've taken against it i know that they're talking about prosecuting some people and 

309.83 315.04 B: and people were going to go to prison for it you know but that remains to be seen whether they do or not 

309.88 310.48 A: all right 

315.23 317.63 A: the top executives did i think you know 

317.86 320.79 A: they were on trial and they lost a lot of money and of course 

321.18 322.21 A: that whole company 

322.72 323.94 A: all the companies involved 

324.46 324.88 A: um 

326.03 326.98 A: were either you know 

327.74 328.44 A: there were 

328.60 329.21 B: but didn't 

328.75 329.54 A: they were dissolved 

329.65 333.08 A: like the accounting firm was dissolved and like thousands of people lost their jobs and then 

333.39 334.01 A: enron 

334.68 336.78 A: everyone lost their jobs at enron as well 

336.90 337.71 B: right but 

337.33 337.96 A: so (( )) 

338.24 339.97 B: but i don't know that everybody has 

340.07 340.56 B: some 

341.88 346.33 B: actually been punished for you know for what they did the people that actually took the money and 

346.83 351.44 B: and uh you know sold their stocks bailed out before you know 

351.61 353.86 B: other people had the opportunity to you know 

354.99 356.29 B: you know what i mean before they 

356.66 361.72 B: before the other people you know like they were encouraging the other people to hang in there because it was going to get better and then they said well you know 

362.39 362.91 B: um 

363.30 365.72 B: they bailed out on there's and you know 

366.27 366.92 B: covered their 

367.73 369.01 B: their butts so to speak 

369.46 369.71 A: yeah 

369.88 371.87 B: and i'm putting it nicely and 

371.99 375.15 B: and so i'm not really sure if those people have actually been i mean 

375.38 378.07 B: couple people lost their mansions and some other 

378.22 380.77 B: state you know but i don't know that they've really 

380.91 383.45 B: you know they're not really suffering as far as i can 

383.99 384.35 B: you know 

384.50 385.31 B: really tell 

385.80 386.78 A: right yeah they will 

386.36 387.10 B: i don't think 

386.89 390.00 A: mansions and their leer jets and and things of that nature but 

391.42 396.12 A: (( )) the people who really suffered i would say were the shareholders and the employees you know come to (( )) 

395.09 395.84 B: oh yeah 

396.47 397.41 A: people who um 

398.39 399.18 A: people who 

399.35 401.41 A: used uh the dividends from the 

401.52 404.48 A: enron stock as part of their fixed income retired people 

404.90 407.32 A: i think they were effected heavily too because you know 

407.76 408.16 B: right 

407.84 408.20 A: (( )) 

408.43 410.57 A: son goes down there's nothing they can really do about it 

410.53 411.12 B: right 

411.33 411.83 B: right that's 

411.97 412.27 B: sure 

412.91 414.51 B: but as far as the people that actually 

413.09 413.58 A: they just want 

415.24 416.59 B: did the damage 

416.80 418.49 B: i don't think they've really suffered yet 

417.05 417.37 A: uh-huh 

418.65 419.45 B: i don't you know 

418.90 419.50 A: no 

420.07 423.07 B: i don't think like if they they said somebody was forced to 

423.40 425.79 B: to sell their home in aspen colorado and 

426.39 426.80 A: right 

426.71 430.13 B: and and i i do feel sorry for the family of the one guy that took his life 

431.13 431.43 B: but 

431.14 431.60 A: yeah 

431.98 432.43 B: you know 

432.66 434.19 B: that family is suffering but 

432.89 433.30 A: i 

435.58 438.97 A: i didn't hear of that actually a an enron executive took his life or 

439.59 440.82 A: or the accounting 

441.42 442.45 A: executive took his life 

442.61 444.73 B: i think it was an enron executive 

445.89 446.50 B: i think 

447.27 447.62 A: yeah 

447.77 449.56 A: i guess i just worry you know it's something that uh 

447.94 448.25 B: (( )) 

450.14 451.83 A: i have to worry about because 

452.25 454.14 A: even though i myself aren't 

454.42 456.27 A: in accounting i'm in consulting 

456.65 458.51 A: i work for an accounting firm so 

458.90 462.07 A: this is the actions of something that i'm no way involved with 

462.47 463.11 A: could've (( )) 

463.24 464.61 A: that could effectively you know 

465.28 467.74 A: i could lose my job over it or something like that 

468.49 473.56 A: and uh it's happened to you know a bunch of people i know they they i knew like five people that worked at anderson 

473.94 475.34 A: and they all had to get different jobs 

476.74 477.03 A: so 

476.87 480.17 B: hm and and some of them are i mean i'm an older person it's not like 

480.73 481.28 B: you know 

481.60 482.00 B: eh if 

482.24 483.24 B: if it were me 

483.48 485.74 B: i would have trouble going out and finding another job 

486.10 487.84 B: you know because i i'm not 

486.28 486.64 A: right 

488.36 489.61 B: thirty years old or 

490.01 490.40 A: uh-huh 

490.19 491.09 B: you know whatever 

491.52 496.77 B: and so the people that have have been in to this company for a long time and they were ready to retire in a year or so 

497.48 500.73 B: or even like five years down the ro- the road or whatever it's like 

501.76 505.01 B: what do they have you know even if they go back into another field 

505.40 510.33 B: or go back into another job they're never going to build up what they had you know i think they said some people lost like 

511.07 516.56 B: three quarters of a million dollars or a million and a half or by the time they would retire that's what they would be getting 

517.14 518.39 B: and you know that's 

519.76 520.83 B: that's a lot of money 

521.27 521.66 A: yes 

521.93 522.27 A: it is 

522.11 525.74 B: you know and they'll never go into another job and and be able to you know 

526.99 529.33 B: some of those people won't ever be able to retire because they will 

529.64 531.02 B: they don't have the income now 

532.48 533.42 A: it's a sad the whole 

534.17 536.08 A: that whole event wa- was very sad 

536.34 538.45 A: everything that happened i mean it was it was horrible 

538.87 539.51 A: i i was 

539.77 541.88 A: you know i had a finance class an accounting class and 

542.06 542.63 A: climb and then 

543.00 545.87 A: ever since all that happened a lot of ethics has been taught but 

546.24 549.05 A: really no one's no one's really talked about what the government should do 

549.32 550.94 A: if the government should do something 

551.85 554.83 A: things like that i think it's assumed that the government should do something at this 

554.93 555.25 A: point 

555.47 557.43 B: well i think the government should do something whether it 

555.87 556.33 A: like the 

557.54 559.63 B: force them to sell everything that they have 

560.05 563.00 B: i mean let them start over from scratch like everybody else with
