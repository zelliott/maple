15.37 19.06 B: oh you've gotten way nicer weather than i have 

18.31 23.47 A: yeah [laughter] yeah i was going to say that we're looking at about uh 

19.13 21.23 B: [laughter] yeah 

23.54 29.17 A: in fact it- it's odd right now it's it's an extremely low temperature like twenty three 

29.66 30.75 A: degrees 

30.53 31.65 B: during the day 

31.41 32.45 A: yeah 

32.18 33.05 B: oh 

32.46 34.79 A: uh just for the past couple of days 

34.50 40.60 B: that's not bad i i think uh my cousin lives in atlanta and i was surprised to find out that um 

40.84 46.81 B: christmas day or new year's day was so cold i don't remember which one but it was like i thought it was ninety there all the time 

46.19 49.10 A: no no no we have [cough] 

49.37 52.25 A: very fluctuating temperatures which 

52.72 60.94 A: is unfortunate for me b- to live here i'm thinking of moving actually um because we have summer we have all four seasons 

60.46 62.55 B: you do end up with winter then 

61.99 65.16 A: oh yeah we have winter we don't have the snow and ice 

64.97 66.99 B: but you still get the cold 

66.41 77.16 A: yeah the bad part and it's it's we have unusually cold temperatures in the last i guess two or three days um last night was in the teens 

67.13 68.00 B: yeah 

76.35 79.57 B: god that's about what we have i'm surprised [mn] 

77.86 82.47 A: yeah yeah we have to go to a lot of um 

82.89 91.31 A: i guess trouble [laughter] when that happens um like leaving the water running all night so the pipes don't freeze 

84.28 84.95 B: (( 'cause )) 

89.53 93.75 B: oh yeah because you're not set up to deal with that kind oh 

91.70 99.06 A: no not at all you see we have it's not unusual to be ninety in the summer and you know 

97.85 98.58 B: (( [mn] )) 

98.70 99.40 B: hm 

99.10 105.61 A: fifteen to twenty in the winter so i it seems to me they would have built our homes better 

105.45 108.95 B: you're right it's because of the fluctuation right 

106.15 107.75 A: or be a little bit more 

108.05 110.90 A: a little yeah are you in a house or an apartment 

110.40 114.67 B: we're in a house and we've been buried with snow the past couple of weeks 

113.97 117.41 A: see and people down here especially the kids would love it 

116.94 129.98 B: but we had seventy degree weather and sixty degree weather just a few we- uh it would snow for a few days and be really cold then everything would melt then it would snow again but now these past couple of weeks it's just been freezing and snowing 

129.30 133.95 A: well the the topic they just gave us um i think was do you prefer um 

133.45 136.22 B: indoor or outdoor activities 

134.76 144.33 A: yeah and or summer or winter and it's funny because you know we see on t._v. all these kids get for christmas santa claus brings them little snowboards or whatever 

136.40 137.47 B: yeah 

143.34 144.62 B: right 

144.25 150.25 A: sleighs and that kind of and we don't have that and it's funny because when we have snow here it's such a big deal 

149.66 152.28 B: the kids get all happy don't they 

150.70 159.80 A: they go out yeah oh gosh sch- school's closed you know everything closes and the kids go out and and and it's funny to watch them they will find 

154.70 155.92 B: (( ah )) 

159.63 173.90 A: anything they can to slide down the street or or a bank in the grass or whatever on this snow and the big thing is uh trash can lids [laughter] it's like the rubber kind 

161.07 161.74 B: mm 

169.86 172.54 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

173.25 174.63 B: yeah 

173.89 185.10 A: and they don't have that handle on the top or anything and i mean they go really fast but you just don't see it and and it's such a big deal because the weather people get all bent out of shape 

175.95 177.16 B: right 

178.08 179.56 B: wow 

184.46 185.68 B: yeah 

185.49 193.71 A: and they assume that we're having some sort of a catastrophe and then it doesn't happen you know or if it does 

189.02 190.03 B: right 

192.26 195.80 B: it's a kind of a a welcome difference once in a while 

194.98 199.68 A: yeah it's [mn] i don't know the kids down here would love to be where you are i'm sure 

198.51 203.30 B: oh see i i just even when i was a little kid i didn't want to go outside in the winter 

202.67 204.28 A: i don't like winter either

211.79 213.38 B: yeah me too 

212.88 213.90 A: (( oh do you )) 

213.48 218.27 B: so everything's outside in the summer and i hide inside in the winter 

217.07 219.06 A: uh-huh we're like bears 

218.82 222.58 B: yeah hi- hi- yeah hibernating yes exactly 

219.23 221.28 A: we hi- [laughter] 

221.97 225.76 A: we hibernate in the winter um [lipsmack] i think though it 

225.69 238.09 A: [sigh] i'm thinking of moving in fact i am a real estate agent and i've got my house on the market and i'm s- i was seriously considering moving south so that i could have my outdoor time 

237.70 239.96 B: all year round yeah 

238.50 241.67 A: yeah or or at least you know most of the year doesn't want to come home for the 

241.59 248.15 B: [lipsmack] well my sister just moved to sarasota and her kids said they never want to see snow again [laughter] and she 

247.33 248.80 A: (( holidays because of the sn- )) 

248.99 250.21 B: (( oh it is )) 

252.05 258.17 A: [mn] uh we don't want to see that snow she loves it well when uh the topic was mentioned and it said indoor or outdoor 

258.44 270.23 A: uh winter or summer i i don't even know what sports or outdoor activities you can do in in the winter other than playing making a snowman do you 

265.17 266.41 B: in the winter 

268.99 275.27 B: skiing people we've got ski resorts around the area and um 

275.30 282.54 B: [mn] some people snowboard sledding ice skating i you won't find me doing any of those hockey 

278.84 280.00 A: oh 

281.25 285.73 A: you see our our ice skating here is indoors 

284.22 289.32 B: right we have indoors and outdoors but even the indoor rinks are freezing 

289.70 292.84 A: mhm i have no desire to be cold 

290.28 291.25 B: so 

291.95 294.33 B: right me either [laughter] 

293.00 304.58 A: no and but i will stay out in the summer uh spring and fall and summer you will find me every minute i have available outdoors a dirty nasty sweaty mess 

303.96 317.88 B: me too [laughter] i would g- i was out there before the i was out there by eight in the morning and i didn't want to come in it was dark and i'm still sitting outside trying to do things paint little rocks for my garden and and stuff 

304.67 306.92 A: [laughter] 

312.69 313.80 A: mhm 

315.57 320.76 A: oh yeah see i didn't realise you could even you have that kind of weather up there i didn't know that 

319.44 329.09 B: well we ended up with warm weather all the way through to like the end of october so i was still watering flowers two months after i thought they should've been gone 

328.45 332.83 A: mhm me too we had an unusual season here i also do um 

329.44 330.95 B: but it was nice 

333.25 335.72 A: uh tomatoes and that kind of stuff 

335.07 338.56 B: yeah see i haven't done any vegetables i'm not real good with 

338.16 339.90 A: it's so easy 

339.51 345.67 B: like i m- we always had vegetable gardens when we were kids my grandparents my parents but i'm just like 

345.79 350.18 B: i don't know i'm just not a real big vegetable eater either so 

348.83 363.73 A: oh okay i wasn't either and and it was like i'm going to buy this little baby tomato plant because you know outdoors i- i- it would give me another reason to go out every day to check on it to see if it grew quarter of an inch and i put it in the ground 

358.83 360.81 B: just to go yeah to go check on 

364.24 368.68 A: and um then i figured out that you have to have those like a cage thingy 

368.35 369.37 B: mhm 

368.75 376.95 A: um so it doesn't just grow up and fall on the ground so i figured out to do that and i was more into just seeing what would happen 

371.58 373.37 B: oh yeah like a trellis 

376.96 389.18 A: uh springtime you know and then as it gets hotter and hotter and hotter to see if it would grow faster or what happened and it did you know it took off pretty well in the spring but by summer i had so many tomatoes 

384.32 385.43 B: (( just mhm )) 

388.98 392.84 A: i was giving them away and i had no clue what i was doing 

390.48 391.59 B: yeah 

392.96 398.20 A: i acted like i did but i didn't know what i was doing i didn't even know when to pick the tomato 

395.39 397.09 B: [laughter] and it worked out 

398.40 410.11 B: see i don't know any of that either the flowers really i mean this year was the first year i had the time to be out there i whether even if i was outside it was at someone else's house um 

400.64 401.66 A: well 

409.97 417.40 B: doing something else but this is the first summer where i was out from morning 'til night planting my own flowers and planting you know 

417.41 423.67 B: bushes and stuff like that but the vegetable garden scared me [laughter] you know it was like 

422.78 424.90 A: it's easier than flowers 

424.25 428.10 B: i probably should try it when it warms up this year 

427.12 434.93 A: i was surprised i thought it was going to take you know a degree in a- plants but it's it's so much easier 

431.67 432.93 B: yeah 

433.01 435.10 B: you had to know what was going on 

435.08 442.82 A: well you just stick it in the ground and give it water and that's all you do i mean what else you know there's no pruning or any of that to it so and then when they're done 

440.69 441.76 B: right 

442.81 450.99 A: um at the end of the season you just pull 'em up and put 'em in the compost pile and they're you know and you've got a place um 

451.05 462.08 A: to dig up for next year which is easier because you've already made the the dirt good so all you have to do is add stuff to the dirt but you just really put it in the ground and eat the tomatoes that's basically what happens 

461.54 463.50 B: i have to try that this summer 

462.89 471.29 A: it's it was such a sense of of uh pride you say oh my gosh god and i did this together 

465.80 468.16 B: i know it makes you feel good you can go 

471.08 478.79 A: and it worked you know and here's this red plump tomato so i didn't use to eat them and then i started sort of putting i thought well 

478.66 490.87 A: since i've got them i can put put them on my salad and it was just in g- take my mother or a neighbour would you like a couple of tomatoes you know oh yeah and and they think you know what you're doing 

481.42 483.14 B: right right 

490.96 494.01 B: well i got to try that i definitely have to try it 

492.80 499.18 A: mhm it's good and it gets you um outdoors you know it's another thing to do outside since we like that anyway 

496.53 498.14 B: keeps you out there 

499.49 504.07 A: i just don't i don't know winter to me is [cough] something to tolerate 

503.84 510.67 B: that's it that's all i'm doing is t- tol- actually i have a muscle disorder and i'm in a lot of pain during the winter 

510.12 510.89 A: mm 

510.68 519.12 B: so now my sister's working on me she's only been out there like six months she's working on me to go too oh it's warm all year 

514.87 515.95 A: mhm
