89.73 90.05 B: yea 

90.99 94.04 B: yea those those tend to create a lot of equity 

95.18 97.09 B: i don't know if you ever (( )) 

97.58 98.57 B: did you know it's a 

99.60 103.43 B: i've often wonder you know some people say that greed is good 

103.93 104.61 B: (( )) 

105.12 107.32 B: drives capitalism but huh 

108.01 110.73 B: i've often thought if greed is so good then 

111.26 115.08 B: why don't people get rid of money all media exchange 

115.45 116.39 B: and see what happens 

116.74 117.10 B: you know 

117.67 118.26 A: yea 

118.39 121.76 B: so (( )) i think that's why people have this it cause huh 

121.91 123.95 B: people know that greed isn't good and that 

124.36 127.32 B: if you didn't have any kind of media of exchange people would just 

127.55 129.86 B: hog every thing to them self and not share with anybody 

130.69 131.01 B: you know 

131.21 132.11 A: yea 

132.05 132.80 B: and so huh 

133.68 137.36 A: greed is not good cause that's what they do they just hog it all and 

137.99 138.71 B: yea and 

138.94 140.94 B: i think the problem with money is that huh 

141.05 142.39 B: doesn't really get rid of greed it just 

142.57 144.06 B: removes it by one degree 

144.67 145.11 A: yea 

145.21 148.87 B: cause now you can still hog it all if you can get the money and so now 

149.63 150.80 B: so now instead of huh 

151.69 154.78 B: you know trying to acquire all the resources through brute force now they do it 

155.31 157.12 B: through money and through money they can 

157.98 161.90 B: they can hire all kinds of lawyers to sue you if you try to cause any trouble the and 

162.20 163.78 B: and they can buy off the politician 

164.46 164.99 A: right 

164.98 165.35 B: yea 

165.47 166.02 A: yea 

168.25 168.91 A: so hum 

169.92 172.63 A: what do you think the government can do about it 

174.42 176.34 A: see if they buy off the government 

176.59 177.06 A: so 

177.25 178.68 B: you know that yea yea 

178.79 180.27 B: so that's part of the problem huh 

182.65 183.20 B: yea huh 

186.59 187.60 B: it would well 

189.14 190.76 A: they need to get like a separate 

190.91 191.29 A: group 

192.14 193.75 A: of people that are 

195.51 196.19 A: you know 

197.72 199.07 B: well you know i was thinking 

197.82 198.97 A: can't be bought off 

199.75 201.69 B: one thing that might make a difference is huh 

202.61 203.27 B: instead of 

203.44 205.42 B: instead of holding elections like we do we 

205.56 206.18 B: we make 

206.71 208.88 B: service in the government like part of a 

209.72 211.49 B: compulsory civil service 

212.16 214.86 B: you know like the way you have people serving on jury duties 

212.25 212.91 A: mm 

214.97 215.37 B: then 

215.25 215.71 A: yea 

215.81 217.07 B: he had people who 

217.67 219.19 B: (( resigned )) a 

219.34 223.66 B: to temporarily hold positions in government and carry out like the responsibility instead of 

224.50 227.87 B: of a position that gave them power and influence over people 

228.41 234.56 B: well you you wouldn't be able to buy them because in the first place it sounds like everybody would have a turn to do it would be 

234.98 239.42 B: like a (( )) so you wouldn't have to run for it and raise tons of tons of money to campaign for it 

239.91 240.43 A: yea 

240.11 240.67 B: and 

241.28 243.35 B: and since it would only be temporary you know you 

243.48 246.80 B: you wouldn't be able to get yourself established in a position of power and 

247.52 250.18 B: and again you wouldn't have to you wouldn't have to rely on those 

250.68 252.23 B: big money corporations to 

252.69 254.94 B: to keep you in power so that that could kind of 

255.44 258.62 B: you know that would you know i think in a way maybe take some of the teeth out of the 

259.14 259.68 B: out of these 

260.05 260.92 B: multi-billion 

261.57 263.52 B: multi-national corporations that are able to 

263.65 264.52 B: to buy the 

264.91 266.06 B: the political seen 

266.89 267.40 A: yea 

269.43 271.49 B: how about yourself have you ever thought about what what 

271.74 273.14 B: could be done to try and a 

274.62 275.79 B: ease the situation 

277.65 278.26 A: no 

278.50 281.05 A: huh except i'd just go buy 

281.34 282.02 A: you know 

282.83 285.22 A: what the bible says that in time 

286.39 288.93 A: god would just wipe out all these governments and 

289.16 289.73 A: you know 

290.05 291.06 A: have his own 

291.42 291.98 B: yeah 

295.89 296.41 B: that that 

296.78 299.44 B: certainly something to look forward to in the future 

299.88 300.43 A: yea 

301.48 303.73 A: so we have to deal with it right now and there's 

303.59 304.08 B: yea 

304.55 306.75 A: they're just going to get more and more corrupt 

308.32 308.72 B: yea 

308.58 312.19 A: and then you know and the only punishment most of them get is 

313.51 315.24 A: is a slap on the hand and 

316.07 316.80 A: and hum 

318.74 319.15 B: yea 

318.74 321.09 A: maybe have to pay back or 

321.00 321.30 B: or 

321.94 323.67 A: or something you know 

323.48 328.54 B: well you want to one of the things about the corporation that gives them kind of an immunity is that a 

329.28 329.71 B: it's not 

329.98 332.35 B: either they have people individuals who head them up 

332.98 335.16 B: the corporation it's self as an entity isn't 

335.31 338.74 B: an individual with a it's a whole group of individuals and so it's hard to 

338.44 338.77 A: yea 

340.13 341.37 A: find out 

340.80 342.21 B: yea well you can't take a whole 

342.40 343.57 B: corporation that has like 

344.17 348.99 B: hundreds of thousands of employs and through them all in jail when the corporation does something wrong so 

349.24 352.14 B: all you can do is try and find the corporation money but 

349.52 350.42 A: yea 

352.84 358.11 B: yea well if you give a hundred million dollar fine to a corporation the next several billion each year they can just 

358.67 361.14 B: right off those fines as part of the coast of doing business 

361.44 363.05 B: you know it doesn't really effect him 

361.77 362.29 A: yea 

363.77 366.84 A: no cause then they take it right out their taxes and 

366.59 367.46 B: yea huh-hum 

368.56 372.34 A: and and bush has got it where all these rich people any way can 

373.01 374.20 A: to make it you know 

374.55 375.55 A: far as you know 

376.30 376.63 B: yea 

376.61 379.53 A: taxes don't affect the (( many )) anyway 

378.63 379.07 B: yea 

380.37 380.82 B: yea 

382.17 382.58 B: (( is it )) 

382.71 387.12 B: yea you know like it certainly does help to have some one like him in the office someone who is 

388.41 391.34 B: friendly toward corporations and business 

392.42 393.17 B: and and i 

393.34 394.80 B: president who has like 

395.44 400.60 B: huh i think they actually said a large part of his cabinet are million airs them selves you know with the 

401.22 402.11 A: yea i know 

401.65 401.97 B: yea 

402.24 402.51 B: so 

402.58 403.02 A: yea 

404.38 408.20 B: so the just seem to be in a higher roll position with things that they want to 

408.82 409.31 A: yea 

417.72 420.84 A: right now there's not really much that can be done 

421.83 422.93 A: with these corporate 

423.58 424.30 A: you know 

425.99 426.40 B: yea 

427.37 431.44 A: bush doesn't seem to be he says he going to do something about hem but 

432.63 435.82 A: he hasn't done much with the ones that has already been caught 

436.41 437.23 B: no i don't 

439.81 440.18 B: hum 

440.89 445.64 B: no this is a little drastic one thing i was reading about was the idea of actually 

446.94 450.14 B: actually revoking the charters because if you revoke 

450.25 454.48 B: revoke a corporate charter that basically dissolves the corporation it's self that would be 

455.17 458.15 B: that would be very drastic but that that's one way you could actually 

458.72 460.11 B: like lay down the law and 

460.69 462.52 B: do something about that 

462.75 463.13 A: mm 

462.98 466.30 B: most politician don't have the guts to do it because doing that would also put 

467.08 467.37 B: you know 

467.47 470.55 A: they would lose their money for their campaign 

467.77 468.14 B: that's 

470.78 477.40 B: we'll you also end up putting a lot of people out of work people who are not at the top but at the lower rungs 

477.05 477.44 A: yea 

478.04 480.87 B: we're employed by that and that would make him unpopular so 

481.39 481.95 A: yea 

482.65 487.10 B: and and i guess you know maybe in way that's what their counting one 

489.12 493.69 B: the politicians will never have the guts to punish them because there would be a lot of on the 

494.79 496.04 B: all of poor 

496.17 497.71 B: and working class people 

498.28 499.84 B: hurt if they 

500.47 501.88 A: yeah and we already have 

500.83 503.09 B: so in a sense they use like there 

503.59 504.11 B: there low 

504.55 509.68 B: huh wage earning employees as kind of a protection a shield 

510.27 512.00 B: any kind of government retribution 

510.42 511.15 A: yea 

512.81 515.87 A: yea and we already have enough problems with unemployment and 

515.60 516.06 B: yea 

516.43 518.53 A: low wage for workers as it is 

518.71 519.13 B: yea 

524.89 525.31 A: yea 

525.68 526.09 A: it's just 

526.20 527.16 A: to bad that they 

527.70 529.56 A: got these greedy people and 

530.98 532.73 A: high corporations that do these 

532.85 533.27 A: things 

534.12 534.45 B: yea 

536.27 537.66 B: and you we're saying before about how 

538.01 541.74 B: gives the people the impression that you that the way to get to the top is to lie and cheat 

541.84 542.39 B: huh 

542.38 542.89 A: mm 

542.84 544.72 B: i was reading an article about this huh 

544.83 547.15 B: i think a c._e._o. at one of the corporations i think it was like 

548.01 549.42 B: (( )) or something that 

549.97 552.51 B: turns out the guy actually lied about his his huh 

553.00 556.73 B: college credentials he i think he said he had a masters degree or something and 

557.14 558.04 B: and and he didn't 

558.16 560.14 B: he actually lied about it but hum 

561.66 565.21 B: you know what they they're still keeping him on he's still getting his basic 

565.38 566.64 B: huh salary which is 

567.52 568.94 B: like six figures and 

571.21 573.05 B: till he you know it it seems like if 

573.37 575.43 B: if you can fake your way through it if you've got enough 

575.87 580.37 B: charm and charisma you don't even have to be educated to get these kind of jobs 

581.37 581.75 A: mm 

581.42 582.05 B: yea that's all 

583.09 588.18 B: you know in that sense it almost seems like even even business to a certain degree has been 

588.68 589.68 B: has become political 

590.49 591.04 A: yea 

595.63 596.21 A: and 

596.53 598.32 A: that doesn't sound fair either
