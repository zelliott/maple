54.07 63.28 B: got together with a couple of friends over thanksgiving the last couple of years and i consider them my family as well family is also

75.05 85.88 A: that doesn't mean you know a lot of my friends it means three or four close friends of mine so uh i think that the family does extend to some of your close friends but not to uh you know the whole group of friends that you have

160.55 161.33 A: yeah 

161.46 163.13 A: yeah 

163.14 167.68 A: yeah i i'm the same way uh i want to call some of my close friends right now actually but uh

170.24 171.34 B: [laughter] 

173.83 178.28 A: i don't know [laughter] i fear they can wait until t- twelve o'clock anyway so 

174.98 175.91 B: yeah 

177.84 180.00 B: [noise] uh-huh wh- 

180.24 182.35 B: can you say where you're calling from

187.06 188.55 B: mhm 

187.92 190.25 A: wow i didn't know it stretched out to all the way over there 

190.33 200.43 B: yeah i got this call from i would say somebody i would consider a family member she told me about this and i signed up for it and thought that was 

201.28 202.72 B: that was really 

202.79 204.85 A: [cough] yeah it sounded like a good idea right 

204.25 210.09 B: yeah it sounded like a good idea and that's what i did and i consider her my my sister 

209.89 212.81 A: mhm one of those close friends right 

212.25 214.39 B: right exactly i 

215.72 224.49 B: she told me about it and i thought that that is a great idea and i also think family can also mean some kind of lingo um if you talk to 

224.63 227.22 B: if you talk to one if 

227.33 236.74 B: if one gay person talks to another they can say oh mhm he's family so that's family can also be encoded shall we say 

235.84 238.57 A: yeah yeah i agree 

238.44 239.74 B: (( and [lipsmack] )) 

239.94 246.93 B: i i met somebody at work and we were talking she was really nice and then she said she said so 

247.59 251.36 B: are you are you family i go uh-huh [laughter] and so 

250.42 251.43 A: [laughter] 

251.65 254.09 B: it can it can mean that too 

254.13 258.19 A: yeah family also uh i don't know if it's what you're getting at but uh 

254.20 255.01 B: so 

258.30 261.38 A: like a group you know like a like a family uh 

261.38 262.47 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

261.54 266.54 A: like a group of friends we call a family sometime [cough] not just your friends in general but a group of friends 

266.22 267.45 B: mhm 

266.80 269.27 A: (( you know like they're oh yeah they're my family you now )) 

269.40 274.64 A: and then obviously you know it's not your like your family your blood family but you know a family of friends 

275.83 277.52 B: yeah 

276.83 281.33 A: yeah but i think that family definitely constitutes 

281.36 289.36 A: you know people that you call uh round the holidays or hang out with in the holidays people you're around all the time and it's 

289.95 292.88 A: uh yeah your close friends like you said i agree 

292.67 301.18 B: mhm [lipsmack] for instance in new years i spent time with my friends joel and kathleen they're a couple and i uh 

299.60 300.58 A: mhm 

301.44 315.24 B: i consider them family i spend my extra time my downtime with them going to movies having din- dinner together a lot and and watching movies or talking about books we read a lot of books 

313.93 314.80 A: mhm 

315.24 319.54 B: or i don't know if we read a lot of books as much as we buy them and talk about them 

318.95 320.20 A: (( yeah )) 

320.33 325.56 B: so we love to read and [lipsmack] and i would also 

325.71 328.78 B: consider that family in the in the sense where 

329.87 332.44 B: we can get together and 

332.67 340.06 B: you know she'll make dinner for us and we're like well i want to do something no that's okay so it also means 

340.38 344.31 B: something in the respect of you're doing this but uh 

345.92 349.54 B: but you don't you owe me the next time it isn't like that at all 

348.36 349.13 A: yeah 

349.23 351.39 A: yeah mhm 

349.73 350.50 B: it's 

350.97 353.31 B: i consider that family 

352.73 357.87 A: just doing it out the goodness of you know pers- just for the person because you care for them and all of that 

357.80 358.75 B: and i can 

359.04 371.46 B: call them and talk to them anytime about things and help me out with with matters help helping me or you know drive me to the airport or go to uh 

369.38 370.42 A: mhm 

372.66 375.21 B: go places and and 

374.61 375.43 A: see 

376.35 383.63 A: it is interesting that i have two or three families actually because i have my family at home here you know the family that i was i was born into 

383.79 389.69 A: then i have my family at school then i have my family of friends here at ho- at home i have my close friends 

389.82 391.10 A: and i'm 

391.87 397.55 A: really with all three um families so it's s- sort of like the same 

397.68 398.47 A: (( you know )) 

398.65 403.42 A: like i'm close to my friends at school but really i got my family of friends here at home 

403.61 404.28 B: (( mhm )) 

404.29 405.15 A: so 

405.46 406.84 B: i agree with you there 

405.97 409.29 A: (( i i think i think you've got to have you know three or four families )) 

409.45 410.18 A: (( but )) 

410.30 410.86 A: (( [sigh] )) 

411.34 420.17 A: so families not just con- you know it's not just your one family that you're born into theres you know friends and you can have more than one i believe 

421.39 432.92 B: yes that's that's very true and it's nice when they all can come together you can bring your friends home or have your friends come along if if real family is in town or nearby 

431.61 432.60 A: mhm 

432.92 434.08 A: (( mhm )) 

433.50 444.03 B: i've a really close friend and she has a little girl and i consider her my niece and i i i love her to i love 'em both 

443.63 445.39 A: mhm 

445.83 448.74 B: and i can go to them anytime i can 

448.79 450.56 B: (( babysit i can )) 

450.86 455.94 B: i can play or do anything with with the two year old and 

456.50 459.69 B: (( i consider her family both of them )) 

458.22 461.11 A: (( yeah i agree mhm [sigh] )) 

462.46 466.58 A: i think that this topic is uh one of the toughest ones to talk about what do you think [laughter] 

466.85 470.36 B: yeah it certainly can be especially when you're when you're 

466.98 467.83 A: family 

468.99 469.74 A: yeah 

470.81 471.96 B: i suppose 

472.21 473.12 A: mhm 

472.25 475.37 B: shall we say forced to talk about it 

474.94 476.06 A: yeah that's true 

476.15 477.55 B: [mn] i wasn't sure 

476.57 485.65 A: especially with another stranger it's tough to unders- you know try to it doesn't you don't know how much you want to say in fact you know in terms of getting too personal and all that you know 

485.34 486.53 B: (( mhm )) 

485.74 487.45 A: especially talking about family 

487.62 489.44 B: right 

489.19 492.86 A: 'cause say for instance i was talking to somebody who had no family you know 

493.23 496.92 A: it wouldn't be much of a good choice of topic [laughter] for that 

497.11 499.29 B: yeah that can be tough 

497.47 498.33 A: because 

498.82 499.99 A: yeah it can be 

499.46 511.57 B: e- especially when i when i took this call i it was by a computer and and i wasn't sure if it said family or famine and i thought famine okay uh 

509.44 510.23 A: yeah 

512.32 513.30 B: i don't think 

512.57 513.57 A: [laughter] 

513.38 514.71 B: (( [laughter] i'm not sure if )) 

513.99 514.69 A: yeah
