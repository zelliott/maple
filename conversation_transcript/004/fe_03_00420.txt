119.44 120.00 A: people that 

120.22 125.40 A: at church and stuff that we're with here all the time we're almost a lot closer in some ways than some of our

126.30 126.76 A: family 

127.01 127.50 A: and we're 

128.22 130.42 B: i was thinking the same thing myself it's like

134.88 135.45 B: but you know 

135.04 135.39 A: okay 

135.63 136.95 B: back when i was way younger 

137.30 138.75 B: family was was 

137.37 137.69 A: mhm 

138.99 142.10 B: family it was around it was close you talked to them daily 

141.14 141.49 A: mhm 

142.78 144.53 B: and now uh i have one daughter

148.92 149.30 A: mhm 

150.14 152.74 B: so gosh i miss her like crazy but i also 

151.79 152.60 A: mhm mhm 

153.27 154.77 B: you know i don't talk to her that much 

155.29 156.50 B: (( kind of thing )) so it's uh 

157.11 158.63 B: it's interesting how that goes 

161.22 162.78 B: sometimes in my family 

163.38 165.52 B: uh it's my sister and i are eh uh 

166.04 166.88 B: it's just us 

167.11 168.65 B: to my parents are both dead 

169.10 169.40 A: mhm 

169.18 172.75 B: so we sometimes talk about how we don't have much family 

173.27 173.66 A: mhm 

173.54 177.29 B: uh my girlfriend that lives with me has got just millions of family 

177.61 182.36 B: god they all know one another and see one another and do this and that and i don't i miss that 

177.76 178.13 A: uh-huh 

182.83 183.25 A: right 

183.65 186.82 B: yeah kind of like your saying but (( god )) the baby makes up for it probably 

187.36 189.25 A: yeah yeah no i eh 

190.07 192.31 A: yeah um i mean my parents don't live 

192.42 193.78 A: that far away but we don't 

194.16 202.12 A: we don't see them that much but now they want us to see us constantly with the baby so it's you know and there aren't a lot of other relatives yeah 

197.68 198.03 B: yeah 

202.30 202.57 A: so 

203.02 204.08 A: um (( let me see )) 

203.21 204.59 B: well they're not i've found 

204.32 207.04 A: me and my sister like i have one sister i see maybe 

204.72 204.98 B: (( )) 

207.48 208.55 A: twice a year or so 

208.44 209.24 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

209.37 209.71 B: uh-huh 

210.22 211.50 B: well you know it's interesting like 

211.68 213.08 B: following up on what you said 

213.41 213.71 B: about 

213.87 219.50 B: i've got fr- i've been living in austen about ten years so it's a mu- it's a music town and (( i like )) that 

216.93 217.28 A: mhm 

219.92 220.30 A: mhm 

220.12 221.84 B: i've got friends that i talk to 

222.20 223.28 B: almost everyday 

223.94 224.49 A: mhm 

224.06 224.67 B: and so you 

224.78 230.40 B: you wonder how that is different from family like you were saying your sister or my sister or whatever where you don't talk to them 

227.45 228.00 A: right 

230.95 231.78 B: uh you know 

232.13 233.54 B: uh very often at all 

233.89 234.25 A: mhm 

234.10 234.58 B: so it's 

235.07 236.49 B: hard to define that word 

237.34 237.79 B: uh 

237.41 239.25 A: yeah yeah i agree yeah 

239.76 240.20 B: yeah 

240.76 241.31 B: uh 

241.66 243.19 B: in a musician's sense 

244.13 245.36 B: i'm a country guy and 

245.54 245.85 A: uh 

245.60 248.31 B: uh willie nelson always talks about his family 

249.00 253.73 B: so it's like a traveling entourage that does this and that and this and that so the folks that i know 

254.11 255.26 B: say where i play music 

255.99 257.97 B: uh yeah you kind of think of them as your family 

258.29 258.96 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

258.99 261.23 B: so i guess family doesn't have to be blood 

261.38 262.26 B: like you know i guess 

262.93 263.30 A: mhm 

263.35 263.65 B: uh 

264.48 264.94 B: trying to think 

266.22 266.68 B: um 

268.70 269.58 B: yeah at all 

270.10 270.58 B: um 

271.29 273.43 B: well so what made you guys decide to have a 

273.59 274.28 B: a kid 

274.43 276.88 B: uh at a later age or whatever any any big 

277.05 278.09 B: revelations there

286.36 287.38 A: yeah we had we had 

287.62 288.24 A: it kind of 

289.04 291.49 A: not focused on giving up in some sense on that 

292.23 292.62 A: and 

292.47 293.91 B: well i i can't see 

293.06 296.85 A: or even trying to adopt and stuff yeah so it's uh he he came as a 

297.08 298.60 A: a real surprise yeah he's 

299.04 299.91 B: you know i have a 

300.03 300.30 B: a 

300.42 302.00 B: interesting story that i bet you've heard 

302.12 302.51 B: of 

302.67 303.10 B: my 

303.44 308.48 B: a bunch of friends when i grew up in houston and so a lot of friends went to med school and there and all 

309.18 311.15 B: the two of them in particular (( got their )) 

311.37 312.72 B: groups were uh 

312.85 314.54 B: couldn't have kids or thought they couldn't 

314.96 318.18 B: and so they went through all that testing i don't know what all 

318.50 318.85 B: and 

319.25 320.92 B: ended up that they adopted 

321.14 327.21 B: one one adopted and one was about to but both had children right then and so these guys were doing research and they said that happens 

327.51 328.07 B: fairly oft- 

327.63 328.16 A: yeah 

328.77 329.60 B: isn't that wild 

329.90 330.47 A: it's it's 

330.31 330.60 B: uh 

330.83 340.30 A: it's strange yeah because i mean we're probably still going to we were looking to adopt ol- you know somewhat older children probably will still do that at some time but yeah it really is strange (( )) 

332.35 332.70 B: yeah 

341.17 341.53 A: ah
