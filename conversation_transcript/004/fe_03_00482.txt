32.68 34.09 A: oh my goodness 

35.22 40.82 A: oh i'm sure i'm sure does she have to take any special medi- you know precautions because of that

60.86 67.71 B: um no not really um i mean it it's open heart surgery but um 

65.57 66.46 A: right 

67.66 70.42 A: my husband has mitral valve prolapse but uh 

67.78 68.34 B: (( [mn] )) 

69.75 71.11 B: really 

70.47 71.33 A: yes 

71.34 73.38 A: my husband does yes 

72.77 75.48 B: so is he going to have to have his [mn] 

74.63 83.36 A: uh not at this time they just basically you know watch him and they um [lipsmack] they medicate him before he has any dental work or any you know 

83.07 85.15 B: yeah um 

84.13 93.72 A: anything like that but other than that i mean he really has no other symptomology from it he d- he didn't even know he had it it was picked up you know in a doctor's office yeah 

93.29 97.97 B: wow well it is it's a very distinct sound 

97.34 98.42 A: yes 

98.36 99.45 B: um 

99.53 102.91 B: that they used to bring the 

103.34 106.23 B: um when she first got it she was one 

105.93 106.99 A: mhm 

106.59 107.60 B: um 

107.72 111.03 B: and she got it from [cough] a blood infection 

110.67 112.09 A: oh boy 

111.71 112.87 B: (( u- um )) 

113.45 116.48 B: that went to the mitral valve and uh um 

117.47 121.62 B: but they used to bring the you know the interns around to listen to her 

121.06 123.49 A: right because it's so pronounced huh 

122.83 127.10 B: [laughter] yeah especially when you're one i guess it's real easy to hear 

126.81 128.07 A: wow 

127.66 128.74 B: um 

128.33 134.85 A: it's hard to have a sick infant my daughter wasn't well as an infant and a sick baby is very tough to take [laughter] i know 

134.94 141.95 A: very hard to deal with uh she wasn't anywhere you know not horribly sick but she had um a reflux where she used to stop breathing 

141.97 147.28 A: and um so we had to have a lot of treatment for her as well and it was uh and it was a tough year 

147.45 150.29 B: oh my goodness she would stop breathing 

148.47 149.59 A: yeah 

149.99 163.10 A: she yeah she used to stop uh stop breathing and they didn't know why in the beginning you know they weren't sure the reason um but everything used to back up from the esophagus 'cause there was a valve that wasn't working at the base of the esophagus 

155.00 156.58 B: (( [sigh] oh )) 

163.25 169.27 A: and um [mn] generally a lot of times tha- which is what happened to her they just outgrow it but it took eleven months 

169.40 174.79 A: for her to outgrow it and during that time whatever came up especially as an infant she didn't know how to clear it 

174.95 177.51 A: so she would choke and stop breathing 

177.61 179.78 A: she wore a monitor for eleven months 

179.55 184.00 B: oh my good- well my daughter had the had the reflux too 

180.95 181.53 A: (( [mn] )) 

183.52 184.52 A: mhm 

184.54 192.00 B: um and eventually when she was she didn't outgrow it when she was three she had the surgery to correct it 

191.50 192.78 A: oh really 

192.33 193.37 B: um 

193.84 196.52 A: oh wow so she's had more than her share huh 

193.89 194.88 B: (( the )) 

196.39 202.70 B: yeah well she also ha- they wouldn't let her have the surgery until she was three because of the heart problem 

202.18 203.35 A: oh boy 

202.73 207.22 B: and the only reason they let her have the surgery then was because she also had um 

207.34 209.42 B: a malrotated valve 

209.30 210.91 A: oh my goodness 

210.49 212.29 B: and her um 

212.71 218.68 B: [lipsmack] they need to pin that down so that it doesn't try and rotate back on its own 

218.53 220.07 A: oh my goodness oh god 

218.99 220.31 B: and then you lose 

220.44 223.84 B: you know large parts of your of your colon [laughter] 

223.93 225.36 B: so the um 

225.41 227.81 B: yeah she um 

227.14 229.28 A: you've certainly had your share with her 

229.10 233.72 B: yeah we we've been in and out of hospitals [laughter] um 

231.72 232.40 A: mm 

234.43 238.22 A: does she get sick more often because of these conditions 

238.41 239.68 B: um 

238.44 242.42 A: like in the winters and things is she more prone to colds and and things like that 

243.27 249.87 B: i don't i don't think so i try and give her really really good nutrition um 

248.16 249.20 A: mhm 

250.53 253.59 B: in fact after the surgery she had a heart arrhythmia 

253.83 262.11 B: and when she was in the i- in the intensive care when she was still there and they couldn't um 

258.54 259.47 A: right 

263.69 265.66 B: they couldn't figure out why 

265.77 273.16 B: and it was because they weren't giving her calcium um the- [mn] the and at home she gets 

268.85 270.01 A: wow 

273.94 275.14 B: um 

275.63 282.25 B: i ma- i make sure she gets at least um at least thirteen hundred milligrams a day 

281.75 282.72 A: mhm 

282.48 283.72 B: and 

283.78 285.54 B: (( a- as soon as they gave her )) 

284.85 286.68 A: in food or or supplements 

286.89 288.60 B: um through supplements 

288.16 295.73 A: okay 'cause i'm i'm big into supplements [laughter] oh yes oh yes i there was a point where i was taking 

290.76 292.19 B: (( you are oh )) 

295.74 298.51 A: uh between thirty and forty supplements a day 

298.85 306.36 A: i- i've cut back a little bit you know i'm not quite as a [laughter] fanatical as i was but my husband and i went through some periods where we um 

298.94 300.02 B: my goodness 

306.56 313.84 A: we still believe in supplements you know tremendously but we've cut back only out of probably laziness [laughter] more than anything 

313.95 315.84 A: it's hard to take that many a day 

316.48 320.93 B: yeah that well she uh um she i give her 

321.03 322.28 B: ensure 

322.04 323.13 A: mhm 

322.71 323.74 B: um 

323.23 324.05 A: right 

323.77 335.33 B: three different kinds the nutritionist is like why you know just give her one it's uh you know one kind i'm like no it doesn't work like that [laughter] she needs different ones for 

332.33 333.38 A: right 

334.40 337.77 A: different medi- yeah different minerals and and things sure 

337.60 338.65 B: um 

338.54 339.50 A: sure 

339.15 341.93 B: for different things and uh the uh 

342.19 343.35 B: um 

343.36 344.19 B: and it 

344.24 348.77 B: it's sort of like she's not to you know it's not too much trouble to do it for her either 

349.05 350.98 A: no yeah tha- that's the ea- 

349.86 357.13 B: yeah i mean th- [mn] the nutritionist is like th- that would seem like too much trouble and it's like it's not [laughter] 

355.39 368.82 A: and it's certainly not for your child [laughter] my goodness no i wouldn't think so [laughter] i wouldn't think so we're a re- relatively healthy bunch especially you know knock wood this winter we haven't um none of us have been sick now tomorrow we're all wake up with colds 

368.05 370.55 B: (( [laughter] do you do you get flu shots )) 

368.95 369.88 A: [laughter] 

370.40 371.22 A: no 

371.47 375.01 B: oh we get [mn] we do i do we do get flu shots 

374.64 375.71 A: oh you do 

375.29 376.82 B: yeah 

375.84 389.06 A: see we haven't any really i mean we get you know occasionally a normal you know thing but i think for the last even few two or three winters my son is seventeen and my daughter's fifteen now um [lipsmack] we haven't none of us have even had a cold 

389.33 397.94 A: and i mean we've really uh been very lucky you know if we had a cold it was a couple of days you know and uh took our echinacea [noise] and uh that helps 

398.46 403.52 B: well um that the other thing is my my daughter has downs syndrome 

403.58 406.44 B: and [mn] um sometimes they get low on 

405.65 407.35 A: [laughter] 

407.08 410.12 B: low on zinc so i make sure that she has 

408.94 410.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] mm )) 

410.78 418.29 B: zinc too so i don't know if that helps i don't know if zinc is supposed to ward off the col- cold or just make it not as bad when you get it 

417.76 424.70 A: um i think zinc is supposed to be for throats more than colds yes i think it's a throat um thing more than a 

420.51 422.10 B: oh it is for throats 

422.83 423.62 B: (( oh )) 

424.75 428.79 A: a cold thing i think the only thing for a cold or anything like that is echinacea 

429.39 439.47 A: which you know you really have to mega dose that as soon as you start to feel any symptoms and that you know we found helps a little bit but for the most part you know you get a cold you get a cold 

439.68 445.46 A: you know as far as i can tell i don't see too much uh other than a antihistamine or something to really uh 

445.63 449.92 A: help it along and do a little chicken soup doesn't hurt but [laughter] 

447.99 453.46 B: [laughter] well she she can't um she can't 

453.63 457.52 B: (( um have a decongestant um )) 

455.61 457.80 A: oh no the antihistamine 

458.15 465.72 B: she can have the antihistamine but she takes but she and she and she takes one regularly because she has allergies the spring is the worst 

465.17 466.62 A: oh my goodness 

466.70 468.86 A: boy she keeps you busy it seems 

469.40 471.34 B: yeah it it um 

469.71 470.91 A: [laughter] 

471.38 477.67 B: since her heart surgery she's come off a couple of her medicines and it hasn't 

477.75 478.84 B: um 

479.22 484.19 B: it see- it it sort of like it seems so much easier [laughter] 

482.18 484.74 A: [laughter] how old is she now 

484.65 485.55 B: ten 

485.23 487.13 A: ten oh okay yeah 

486.47 487.17 B: (( uh )) 

487.50 490.89 A: and she's when does she come off the medi- [mn] medications okay 

490.28 492.85 B: well um she came off 

492.86 494.70 B: one in 

495.11 501.98 B: um december and one in january she u- um she still 

502.24 509.85 B: has like five meds five different meds and multiple multiple doses a day but it's for um 

505.45 506.57 A: my goodness 

510.49 522.08 B: t- they cranked back her every eight hour med to every twelve it just [mn] oh it [noise] it's like a world of difference i can sleep now [laughter]

518.86 519.85 A: yeah 

520.09 521.22 A: mhm 

521.39 526.39 A: yeah and you know people don't realize how how that sounds like it's only four hours but that makes a big difference 

526.41 527.22 B: (( it does )) 

527.06 528.49 A: it certainly does 

527.91 542.47 B: it's sort of like because she's got a g. tube a gastric tube i give i can give her her meds when she's asleep so i did try and give it to her every eight hours 'cause the cardiologist told me it was her im- most important med 

531.78 533.06 A: (( mhm right ))
