21.38 22.40 A: really 

21.61 27.73 B: i yeah i i don't like going to the doctor at all unless i absolutely have to [laughter] 

24.84 25.91 A: oh i j- 

26.70 35.95 A: i just i just go i find it it always um it's comforting or whatever [laughter] but i don't get sick that often once in a while a sore throat or something like that 

32.84 33.85 B: right 

35.69 45.06 B: well i'll take my kids to the doctor but i for myself usually i won't i have a eight month old baby and a six year old

59.62 66.61 B: i know my son was sick all the time he was allergic to everything he was sick all the time and my daughter had a fever once and that's all 

66.10 76.57 A: what happens is when they're sick when they're younger um they develop an immunity and then when they're older they don't get sick and if it's just the opposite happens if they haven't been exposed to a lot of germs or don't get germs
