331.29 331.95 A: (( yeah )) 

332.44 340.02 B: and that's great i wish i grew up on a lake and and now i'm in the middle of the city so it's not anywhere near as accessible 

339.85 344.33 A: because you could we ran all over the ground that is under the lake 

344.37 349.26 A: and so when we watched them build it and then when they let it fill up you know the rivers 

349.38 357.95 A: the dam held it back and it filled up and everything so it was kind of neat because we knew the land that was under there so it was kind of neat it was kind of neat to watch 

357.99 362.04 B: but i guess that was cool did you guys like um did they let any volunteer 

362.47 365.33 B: people like in the community volunteer to help when they were doing it

386.98 389.39 B: even if it was man made it was still a big change 

389.06 396.68 A: and now when it like when it floods and stuff you think of how much it i mean how much that land's changed it's just it's neat
