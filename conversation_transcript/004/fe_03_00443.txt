100.95 110.88 A: had uh shut his factory down after a fire he did you know take care of his employees and everyone everything i mean you do hear a few stories about things like that but 

107.26 108.03 B: mhm mhm 

111.33 115.52 A: i mean that does seem to be less common more people are just out to get what they can 

115.44 120.01 B: yeah you know what that goes on at my job like um 

120.76 121.83 B: i do um 

122.89 123.86 B: time sheets 

124.49 125.50 A: mhm 

130.62 136.37 B: job code numbers and they record their time against these codes and the 

135.61 136.66 A: mhm 

136.47 142.17 B: they my my supervisor i work for the controller and my supervisor she um 
143.28 146.08 B: i put the information from the time sheets on the computer 

150.73 153.11 B: they do like their efficiency reports 

153.73 155.03 A: mhm m- 

153.85 165.13 B: from the time sheets and i hm i sort of saw one of the vice presidents at our company he kind of falsified some billing 

165.48 166.04 B: you know 

166.74 168.80 B: it sort of seemed like it to me 

166.87 167.92 A: mhm 

170.06 171.98 B: he had us like go back through 

173.40 174.66 B: they billed the company 

179.48 181.90 B: and the company want they sent auditors 

182.28 183.28 A: mhm 

182.96 188.81 B: to our um job-site they wanted to see where this fifteen thousand dollar bill came from 

189.22 190.49 A: mhm 

189.44 190.07 B: you know 

190.68 197.95 B: and they went through and they dug out all the time-sheets and then they made all these spreadsheets you know to justify this billing 

197.23 198.45 A: mhm 

198.64 200.08 B: so i it is like 

198.70 199.69 A: mhm 

201.25 202.93 B: i guess it goes on everywhere 

203.45 204.70 A: mhm 

205.06 205.75 B: you know 

205.55 207.07 A: (( i know )) 

207.60 208.57 B: it it was this 

207.74 211.74 A: oh that is a lot of money um 

209.34 210.80 B: yeah yeah 

221.49 221.99 B: (( kind of )) 

222.60 225.47 B: sort of felt like we were participating in fraud 

226.26 230.51 B: you know so it is like this corporate corruption is like 

227.28 229.13 A: mhm 

230.83 231.97 B: everywhere 

232.14 233.07 A: mh- 

233.04 237.06 B: everywhere you know it is it is not just enron on the television 

237.27 239.38 A: mhm yeah 

237.88 240.36 B: you know i've seen it up close and personal 

240.75 241.37 A: mhm 

241.82 245.21 B: you know to and i guess that is the way things go 

251.26 251.80 B: huh 

255.64 256.74 B: mhm mhm 

256.24 258.76 A: i mean they could have more regulation of 

259.36 264.24 A: accounting which does specifically speak to the enron the problem 

264.34 264.91 B: mhm 

265.18 266.70 A: um 

265.23 268.20 B: see that is where i work in the accounting department 

267.94 272.61 A: i mean because that i mean really is where the buck kind of has to stop 
272.53 273.98 B: mhm mhm 

273.39 282.99 A: you know i mean in it was like horrible what they did at enron but it was more shocking that the auditors were not catching them 

279.60 279.98 B: (( )) 

283.15 284.03 B: mhm 

286.59 287.40 B: mhm 

293.76 296.98 A: more adversarial all when they are almost like um 

296.93 297.78 B: routine 

298.00 301.45 A: yeah like figuring out how to make it true 

301.81 302.54 B: mhm 

302.04 303.48 A: you know instead of 

302.74 303.45 B: mhm 

303.67 306.05 A: really trying to get to the truth 

306.14 307.05 B: mhm mhm 

306.74 312.86 A: so it is it is you know it is un- it was uncomfortable to me the ones that i've been participating in 

312.93 314.34 B: i know i hear you 

314.12 318.55 A: you know -cause it seemed like the people that were doing the auditing weren't really looking critically 

318.85 319.88 B: mhm mhm 

319.23 319.93 A: um 

322.06 330.64 B: and then you know what it is like we have at our job we have like outside accountants that come in and audit us and um 

328.90 329.62 A: mhm 

331.49 333.78 B: we just had like a company meeting 

334.47 337.47 B: (( a )) couple of days ago where they um 

337.85 339.55 B: and at the meeting they said they 

340.36 341.76 B: they changed accountants 

342.89 345.99 B: and they said it was because of the price 

346.55 348.52 B: but you never know about things like that 

349.08 349.77 A: mhm 

349.80 350.29 B: you know 

350.47 351.17 B: you never know 

351.77 352.93 A: mhm 

352.11 353.05 B: never never know 

353.76 359.45 A: yeah well i mean i do think that one thing that the the government can do is have more regulation of 

359.65 360.54 A: auditing 

360.80 361.73 B: mhm mhm 

361.01 361.85 A: for 

362.46 363.17 A: um 

363.32 369.11 A: and more kind of and that the auditors also need to have more of a kind of 

369.27 373.02 A: mission and you know statements that they make about 

373.32 374.45 A: their profession 

375.10 380.33 A: you know a pro- professional ethics the way lawyers and doctors do 

380.56 382.67 B: mhm mhm 

380.98 382.07 A: um 

382.95 384.07 B: you know what eh 

383.13 387.32 A: you know and maybe they need to have something like malpractice insurance 

386.43 387.59 B: mhm mhm 

387.56 388.67 A: um to 

388.77 389.68 A: you know 

390.40 392.53 A: um that they would have to pay 

392.63 396.87 A: you know because i mean all those people in enron are just like they have no 

397.06 399.41 A: they have no um pensions 

399.80 401.98 A: you know it is terrible what happened to those people 

402.28 410.44 B: yeah i hear you you know what do you really thing the government is like okay they are (( the )) government is republican now they are pro- big business 

411.03 414.58 B: you know what i mean it is like they are more interested in 

411.84 413.29 A: mhm 

415.40 418.83 B: business prospering than they are in the 

418.96 421.82 B: middle class and the poor people it is like 

421.58 422.85 A: right 

428.97 430.32 A: yeah 

431.51 435.53 B: there is going to be you're either going to be rich or you are going to be poor 

435.85 437.72 A: yeah i mean i 

435.91 438.59 B: now there is no in between and 

438.16 444.76 A: yeah i do agree with you but i think that even you know i mean the republican sort of have uh a 

444.88 447.15 A: (( a moralist )) kind of um 

447.93 449.87 A: line that the like to 

449.73 450.37 B: mhm 

450.61 455.55 A: put out there and i think that you know i think that reforming 

451.93 452.57 B: okay 

456.05 457.66 A: reforming the um 

457.95 464.16 A: auditor would that would be something that would go along with their kind of party-line 

464.27 465.21 A: um 

466.49 470.41 A: you know and that would be something that they might be interested in 

470.87 471.58 B: mhm 

471.21 472.25 A: um 

471.96 473.04 B: yeah that is true 

473.89 475.98 B: but i just think you know it is like 

476.77 479.24 B: the republicans have a tendency to 

482.05 485.41 A: yeah to really support them and try to 

484.00 484.60 B: yeah 

485.83 487.40 A: to forward their interests 

487.31 491.26 B: yeah instead of putting sanctions on them yeah they are gung-ho for 

488.15 489.17 A: yeah 

489.98 490.84 A: yeah 

491.56 493.56 B: whatever big business wants 

491.82 492.53 A: yeah 

492.76 497.29 A: but i mean this is a really i mean usually we have recessions under 

497.92 499.24 A: democratic 

499.94 504.99 A: um i mean historically there are have been more recessions in democratic but this is different 

501.95 502.73 B: mhm mhm 

505.75 515.58 A: you know we have a republican president a republican congress and a recession at the same time so i mean this may change uh some of their thinking about some of how they approach things 

515.75 517.94 B: you know what life is tough right now 

518.29 519.29 A: mhm 

518.67 521.45 B: it is kind of kind of tough it is find of spooky 

521.90 523.86 B: you know the way prices and things are 

524.93 525.85 B: kind of spooky 

527.71 528.29 B: you know 

528.16 529.36 A: yeah 

529.12 529.81 B: yeah 

529.47 530.27 A: yeah 

531.72 532.29 B: yeah 

534.41 535.39 B: okay
