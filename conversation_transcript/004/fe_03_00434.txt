90.06 94.89 B: i've gotten older and when i was younger and people said you know 

94.99 106.86 B: um you better pay attention to you elders now learn what they have to to tell you and all you know i didn't pay a lot of attention but that's something that that really hits home now i've 

109.33 112.63 B: my grandparents and a lot of aunts and uncles and 

110.05 110.50 A: mhm 

113.14 114.40 B: over the years and

121.60 127.95 A: do you feel like you you've gotten uh i guess deemed or earned more respect over time as you've grown older or 

126.65 131.60 B: oh gosh yes so much more especially from my kids um 

132.12 136.96 B: something that i can see is the way my kids used to love 

137.06 141.40 B: my parents or the way that my grandkids love me now 

142.18 142.77 B: and 

142.67 143.11 A: mhm 

143.36 147.77 B: as my kids were growing up i was just in too much of a hurry 

147.88 150.80 B: to many things to do uh 

151.46 153.74 B: yeah and and now i just 

151.57 152.86 A: well it's always that way 

153.32 153.85 A: you know 

153.88 156.34 B: i find time for the grandkids 

156.46 158.37 B: because they mean so much to me 

159.10 159.79 B: and it's 

160.13 161.93 B: it's a lot different it is 

164.07 170.01 A: well i i have sort of i mean i have a a obviously a blood family but my um my situation is that my um 

170.39 176.18 A: father and my mother both were the only siblings that really moved far away from their families their their direct families 

174.51 175.13 B: mhm 

176.31 179.30 A: so i wasn't really very close with my grandparents 

178.66 179.28 B: yeah

188.47 193.34 A: relatives from you know my mom's side my dad's side and then my boyfriend's family came 

193.96 199.39 A: and um they brought some people that you know were inter married or inter dating or whatever

201.62 202.25 B: yeah 

202.88 211.50 A: you know there was no animosity no nothing and my mom was really nervous about everything and i guess that's another aspect of family is you you know you get kind of nervous around well
