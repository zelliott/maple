45.95 47.31 B: that's amazing 

46.50 51.83 A: it is cause i have neighbors who have five kids and they're always sick 

51.30 53.78 B: well little petri dishes that's what we call them around here 

53.16 58.60 A: yah i i think it's i think some people just have a better hum 

58.73 60.51 A: immune system 

60.34 62.62 B: do you guys i know where we live we have a lot of 

63.21 66.89 B: out door activities you know there's a lot of hiking and biking and 

66.64 67.77 A: mm 

67.28 71.99 B: you know we typically spend our weekends outside and stuff like that is that the same where you are 

72.13 75.71 A: well there's a lot of things like that going on but we don't 

75.05 77.61 B: okay it's a theory oh well 

77.55 82.29 A: yea we're you know we do get outside but we're not really outdoors people 

89.25 92.19 B: open door some where around eleven o'clock and dust us off 

92.30 92.91 B: put us to bed 

93.73 95.84 B: i have a feeling that's why i never get sick 

95.35 99.24 A: huh ha yea you just build up good resistance against 

99.28 99.94 B: exactly 

102.67 105.24 B: i don't even know when the last do i even missed any work 

106.58 107.85 B: couple years ago probably

110.57 111.65 A: be like that 

111.54 112.05 B: yea 

112.52 114.52 B: so i guess we're probably the minority 

113.86 118.96 A: yea i would think so i know when my husband does get sick 

119.49 123.48 A: you know the rare times that he does he usually does it over the weekend so 

124.26 126.63 A: he never misses work because of it 

127.24 129.35 B: that's impressive he must like his job 

128.96 135.07 A: well i don't know 

132.88 136.87 B: i know monday mornings most people are saying gosh i wish i had come down with something

175.06 175.83 B: always a good feeling 

176.18 182.21 B: i know that there's a really big moment out where we live you know to eat healthily and get a lot of exercise 

183.52 184.58 B: i don't know i i 

193.66 194.41 A: recently that 

196.76 197.88 A: think of one of the things that i 

205.28 207.46 A: i never pick at my face with my fingers 

207.73 208.80 B: oh how interesting 

208.73 214.42 A: i hadn't really thought about it if you have to rub your nose use the back of your hand 

214.75 217.81 A: i i usually do i don't use you my fingers 

216.45 218.32 B: oh i i have never heard that 

219.32 221.08 A: that makes sense you know 

221.68 225.12 A: although my kids don't i mean they're kids 

224.37 225.76 B: well right exactly 

225.47 228.30 A: but my husband doesn't either so 

228.33 228.60 B: huh

242.02 242.62 B: yea 

251.36 254.10 B: oh wow now did you wash the kids hands a lot where they we're young 

254.85 257.18 A: oh yea 

256.00 259.30 B: okay so maybe it is an issue more of cleanliness than 

259.58 265.53 A: yea it could be i really got them to wash they're hands after they went too the bath room and stuff 

266.22 267.56 B: we were the exact opposite 

268.23 272.33 B: never wash the hand never did anything like i just figured it would build up a huge immunity 

270.16 271.88 A: huh 

272.36 273.66 A: yea 

273.85 275.02 A: that's that's so 

275.26 277.84 A: it's hard to say it could go either way 

276.37 276.83 B: yea
