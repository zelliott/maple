51.60 53.29 B: i'd say late fall into 

53.95 55.35 B: probably middle of winter 

55.22 58.37 A: well at late fall usually i don't get too sick but 

58.50 59.15 A: it's the 

59.46 61.34 A: starting in the winter when the cold weather starts 

61.73 62.20 B: yeah 

62.26 64.83 A: i think it's because my kids start bringing it home from school 

64.46 65.30 B: that's uh that's 

65.40 66.89 B: possibility yeah that they 

67.42 71.81 A: and i'll tell you it's a little bit too expensive to start going to the doctor every time you have the sniffles so 

71.44 72.02 B: it is 

72.08 73.47 A: i usually take benedryl 

74.47 76.07 B: well i've been taking over the counter 

76.41 77.86 B: (( )) the walmart or the 

78.25 78.99 B: tylenol

80.75 82.82 B: i have pretty good results with tylenol flu

93.11 93.62 A: stuffy nose 

95.19 98.18 B: i don't have that whole lot luck and when i have it i usually 

98.48 100.76 B: i have the whole kit and caboodle the call stuff 

101.26 103.18 B: nose stuffy nose so 

103.88 106.52 B: you know the watery eyes and all of it (( )) 

106.86 110.14 B: i tried to take something to get rid of all of it and i don't know 

110.26 115.05 B: basically i would think (( )) all it does is kind of relieve the symptoms it don't go away 

115.13 118.77 A: no i your your cold lasts about just the same amount of it's just 

118.20 118.91 B: right 

119.03 121.27 A: it makes you makes it more liveable let's say 

121.24 122.35 B: mhm it does 

123.01 123.53 B: no 

123.75 125.97 B: because when you get up and your nose just 

126.18 130.21 B: constantly running or something you know you take something helps that and it makes you feel a little better 

130.45 133.68 A: yeah i can't stand that when my nose is stuffed
