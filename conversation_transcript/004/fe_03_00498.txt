169.23 169.80 A: when you have to 

171.68 173.14 B: try to keep myself healthy 

173.99 176.53 B: because i know it'll pass to her -cause i'm the one who normally has it

192.32 195.54 A: i just have to always make sure i take my vitamins and prevent 

196.29 198.30 A: colds from coming on 

196.31 197.18 B: well that is good 

197.84 199.59 B: my mom is a cancer survivor

218.79 219.52 B: sixteen years 

219.89 220.70 A: that is great 

221.03 222.57 B: yeah yeah it was stage four

228.43 228.96 B: good 

230.16 231.34 B: so what do you 

232.14 232.76 B: you know 

232.92 235.09 B: like preventing yourself from getting sick like 

235.25 237.23 B: so do you take the extra vitamins and

245.04 245.49 B: mhm 

245.92 248.13 A: to help me and i take iron 

248.36 248.97 A: -cause i think 

250.11 252.46 A: the iron helps build your immune system 

252.87 253.28 B: yeah 

253.34 255.09 A: and if your iron levels are low 

255.76 258.60 A: you are going to get sick and my iron levels are very low 

259.38 259.86 B: huh 

260.46 262.30 B: i i still take my uh 

262.49 263.56 B: pre-natal vitamins 

265.06 265.67 A: oh (( why )) 

265.33 268.46 B: so i think it i think it helps -cause i haven't gotten sick this year 

269.08 269.55 B: so far 

271.12 271.84 B: i'm a try not 

271.16 271.43 A: that's 

272.00 273.25 B: you know i try not to 

274.16 279.14 B: (( )) and all that they say is you know going out with (( )) and going out not wrapped up good and 

277.70 278.16 A: mhm 

280.35 282.29 A: but the thing everyone around us 

282.83 285.17 A: has has colds most of the time 

286.28 286.78 B: yeah 

286.99 288.34 B: well i found it's been pretty 

289.18 291.00 B: lucky this year we haven't really 

291.38 292.47 B: none of us has really been 

292.57 293.05 B: sick 

293.68 294.05 B: but 

295.04 296.17 B: i don't know i think 

297.19 299.45 B: i try not to mess with my heat during the winter 

299.73 300.13 A: mhm 

300.62 303.42 B: so you don't get you know hot and then cold and you know what i mean 

303.41 305.95 A: i mean when i'm going out even to the mall 

306.06 307.43 A: you could touch something 

308.04 312.64 A: and someone that's sick has touched it or standing in line someone could 
310.56 310.85 B: yeah 

311.78 312.14 B: (( you have )) 

314.34 316.63 A: when just say being around people that even cough 

317.17 317.55 A: (( it doesn't )) 

318.30 319.04 A: scared i'm going to get 

318.72 319.46 B: i bet 

320.14 322.25 A: i'm scared i'm going to catch their colds 

320.27 321.12 B: i bet 

323.32 325.29 A: and some people don't cover their mouths 

325.94 326.38 A: you know 

326.12 327.92 B: now do you ever go get a flu shot 

328.09 329.77 A: no i don't believe in those 

330.28 331.11 B: see i don't 

331.28 332.78 B: i don't take flu shots 

333.23 333.96 B: i'm a nurse 

334.35 334.81 A: mhm 

334.63 335.87 B: and i don't 

336.22 339.73 B: i don't take flu shots because i know that they try to pinpoint 

340.77 342.24 B: which flu strain 

343.24 344.38 B: is going to be 

345.02 346.32 B: the predominant one 

347.88 352.32 B: they are trying to every year when they do the flu shots they try to predict which flu is going to 

353.02 353.81 B: be the one 

354.11 360.24 B: -cause there are so many strains of it and i took -em when i was younger i got -em every year but i always got sick 

354.15 354.57 A: mhm 

361.60 362.02 A: but they 

361.62 362.25 B: and so it's 

362.98 363.35 B: go ahead 

363.08 367.27 A: i'm sorry but they say when they give you the flu shot they give you a little bit of the flu 

368.41 369.52 B: yeah yeah they do 

370.18 372.46 A: so or you could be allergic to it 

373.23 374.25 A: -cause it's made 

373.31 374.03 B: you know i 

374.36 375.26 A: with (( )) 

376.29 377.50 B: i haven't um 

377.89 380.12 B: gosh i haven't had one since um 

381.97 383.75 B: um not since school 

383.84 385.66 B: last time about eight years ago 

385.81 386.56 B: and 

388.10 390.40 B: like that's when i quit taking them quit getting it 

390.84 391.37 B: flu shots 

393.39 393.76 B: so 

394.18 396.69 A: but do you take anything else to prevent colds 

397.25 403.16 B: um just my multi vitamin but li- you know like i said if i notice if i feel like i'm coming down with something or 

403.83 408.49 B: you know i just try to take it easy i always stock up on orange juice 

408.90 409.75 B: if i feel 

410.09 414.03 B: that i'm going to get sick and i make sure -cause sometimes i'll forget and i'll not take my 

414.34 417.32 B: my vitamin or whatever but i always try to do that 

419.24 419.91 B: you know 

419.27 419.82 A: but i think 

420.52 420.99 B: huh 

421.09 423.59 A: i'm sorry you i'm sorry i'm cutting you off 

423.84 426.72 A: but i think the best thing is when you have a cold 

426.84 427.55 A: sleep 

428.60 429.07 B: yeah 

430.07 431.75 B: i like to sleep when i'm sick 

432.92 434.12 A: you mean before you come 

434.44 437.14 A: coming down with the colds sleep in for the day 

438.10 438.41 B: yeah 

439.17 439.82 B: that is true 

440.90 443.28 A: then with a combination of rest 

443.88 444.75 A: staying warm 

445.87 448.23 A: to prevent a cold and help the colds get better 

449.21 452.39 A: but sometimes going out into the cold and going to the doctor 

452.51 453.78 A: sitting in the waiting room 

454.30 457.05 A: with all the other sick patients you could get worse 

458.27 460.02 B: i think that too 

460.56 462.24 B: i do i think that too 

463.46 464.09 B: i do 

465.11 469.13 B: (( )) it's like with my kids i you know when they get sick i always let them stay home 

469.29 469.66 A: mhm 

469.87 470.55 B: and they always 

470.70 472.94 B: you know i always have orange juice and water 

474.06 474.67 B: and 

474.84 478.41 B: if it's sore throats then i always give -em you know cough drops or whatever 

479.16 479.62 B: but they a- 

479.84 480.54 B: they always 

480.86 482.48 B: tend to stay in bed more 

484.33 484.74 A: mhm 

484.51 486.47 B: as me i you know i'm mom i've got to 

486.70 487.50 B: to be up and 

488.12 488.69 B: you know 

489.38 490.76 B: taking care of everybody else 

491.31 492.16 A: moving around 

491.57 492.19 B: but if like my 

492.65 495.82 B: yeah yeah but if it is a weekend and my husband is home then i can 

496.21 497.43 B: stay in bed when i am sick 

498.20 503.58 A: do you think like over the counter cough medicines work on the flu 

504.53 505.16 B: um 

507.42 509.29 B: i've always just used robitussin 

510.77 512.86 A: i think that is to be very strong 

514.15 517.62 B: yeah it it kind of knocks you out and see i don't like the nyquil 

518.35 519.48 A: i never took it
