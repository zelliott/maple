3.13 3.65 B: hello 

3.95 4.64 A: hello 

4.82 6.40 B: hi i'm gareth elzi 

6.90 8.32 A: i'm diana ransom 

8.51 9.21 B: hi 

8.95 9.70 A: hi 

9.94 11.87 B: so i guess we get to talk about 

12.12 13.04 B: corporate scandal 

13.42 17.20 A: yes and i'm not really sure what i have to say about that 

18.25 20.60 B: well i have a 

20.77 21.29 B: hm 

27.48 29.42 B: the sort of good old boy 

29.91 31.10 B: uh attitude 

31.92 32.35 B: kind of 

32.50 35.15 B: everybody's fitting together and the 

35.38 41.48 B: whole idea of the profit and the bottom line being the uh 

42.87 45.92 B: only corporate deity so to speak 

45.75 46.31 A: right 

46.36 49.72 B: has a lot to do with it personal opinion any how 

58.07 58.82 B: mm 

58.62 62.28 A: and i haven't listened to a lot of news i know whats going on 

62.56 62.97 B: yeah 

63.66 64.57 A: but i 

65.16 67.35 B: well i'm in texas so um 

65.24 65.74 A: i 

67.49 72.30 B: i'm not in houston but i am in texas and of course enron is out of houston 

72.11 72.96 A: yes 

72.91 81.84 B: and um it's really effected a lot of people in this part of the world rather severely simple because their um 

82.87 87.04 B: pension plans and their life savings have gone down the tubes 

86.86 87.49 A: right 

87.61 88.75 B: and um 

89.55 89.98 B: i've 

90.78 91.65 B: feel like there's 

92.30 98.67 B: there definitely needs to be some sort of ability to observe and regulate this 

99.78 105.38 B: obviously they were keeping a number of set of books none of which were 

105.53 108.78 B: you know the public books and the private books weren't necessarily 

108.60 111.58 A: right right the ones that we see aren't the same 

109.20 110.21 B: the same books 

111.51 120.98 B: exactly so i think some how or another their needs to be more effective over-sight of book keeping of my opinion 

121.25 123.01 B: and obviously 

131.21 132.16 B: wreak havoc 

132.38 135.90 B: that way but on the other hand i think that um 

132.40 133.28 A: right 

136.35 136.68 B: if 

136.78 143.13 B: transactions are recorded on computers and set up in such a way that they can be um 

143.54 144.53 B: monitored by 

145.11 150.75 B: appropriate individuals and i know there are firewalls and things like that that can be set up with computer 

150.86 151.31 A: mhm 

151.97 153.35 A: well i'm in iowa 

154.16 156.53 A: and i'm in i'm in a little town 

156.67 157.23 B: uh-huh 

157.36 160.74 A: but we live five miles from a larger city 

160.87 161.53 B: uh-huh 

161.37 162.98 A: and we are 

163.09 165.97 A: it's we're having this with our plants here 

166.07 168.08 B: oh yes i've seen some of that 

167.91 173.20 A: yeah and our biggest plant employs probably ninety percent of our people in our county 

173.30 175.00 B: oh my oh my 

174.19 176.58 A: and right now they're taking bankruptcy 

176.72 178.35 B: so their going down the tubes in you 

178.59 179.39 B: that leaves 

178.77 179.51 A: so 

179.52 181.62 B: the whole area high and dry 

187.48 189.08 A: set up it's just 

189.26 193.52 A: smaller but it was run by a few 

190.36 191.11 B: hm 

193.80 195.03 A: big wig's here 

195.35 195.68 B: yeah 

195.87 198.07 A: and i think they were covering up too 

202.97 204.86 B: particularly of the ninety 

205.21 208.25 B: personal opinion again there was this 

208.79 209.30 B: giddy 

209.42 213.88 B: sense of it's all going to keep going up up up 

213.97 215.17 A: mhm you're right 

215.15 217.42 B: and obviously 

217.60 223.80 B: any body who believes that didn't take their history lessons very seriously because even with 

223.94 231.96 B: mister greenspan's manipulation of the interest rates and this and that and the other which i think he's done fairly decent job of 

231.75 232.47 A: yeah 

232.34 236.23 B: there's still the fact is that there will be economic 

236.74 237.33 B: um 

237.70 240.42 B: flings in both directions and we can not 

241.06 242.11 B: righteously 

242.26 247.00 B: expect everything is going to be roses forever 

246.78 252.70 A: and and another thing around here i've seen we have gambling in iowa 

252.36 253.02 B: uh we 

253.15 253.87 B: don't 

253.69 259.24 A: and our casinos are suppose to be giving part of our money back to the state 

259.26 260.32 B: uh-huh 

267.00 267.38 B: hm 

267.40 271.62 A: i don't see the state of iowa getting enough money back so i think that's 

272.36 274.14 A: another manipulation 

274.21 281.75 B: oh absolutely 

281.57 282.08 A: uh-huh 

290.25 290.84 A: yes 

290.52 300.29 B: well hop de do do do in went in the general fund and got slurped up by anyone who could get their grubbies on it 

304.21 304.88 B: mhm 

306.05 314.71 A: the taxes are suppose to be divided in half off that casinos and and i don't see it we're not getting anything for educations anything for roads 

314.69 315.00 B: mm 

315.25 316.57 A: i just don't see 

317.32 320.46 A: it's it's the big business power there too 

320.49 325.03 B: well i'm not sure if it's big business or stupid government 

324.85 326.53 A: yes that's true too 

326.61 327.66 B: you know i 

335.85 337.35 B: entitled 

337.85 338.38 B: to 

341.99 342.82 B: you know i i 

343.24 347.28 B: that's wanting to throw the baby out with the bath water but i think that 

346.14 346.64 A: uh-huh 

347.82 348.42 B: sometime 

349.54 353.03 B: wise idea that the government's going to take care of us all 

353.36 355.54 B: but who's taking care of the government 

355.42 356.41 A: that's it 

357.20 366.30 A: i agree with that too and i'm i'm a disabled person so it so i you know i get a lot of my funds from the government 

366.22 367.18 B: i see 

367.19 369.74 A: but it it it shouldn't be 

369.91 373.71 A: that everybody depends on them i mean i have a husband and he makes 

373.97 378.87 A: you know money too so i don't really always depend on my disability 

378.59 384.69 B: right you've got some other sources well i'm i'm not retired yet but a few 

380.81 381.46 A: yes 

392.15 393.72 A: that's yeah 

394.26 397.51 B: because i teach but i uh 

397.64 399.78 B: at a private school so that makes it even better 

399.60 400.31 A: oh 

400.49 403.72 B: but i don't like the idea that 

404.78 406.85 B: most of not not most but 

407.07 408.37 B: fair chunk of what i'm 

408.93 410.90 B: making actually goes 

411.38 416.97 B: to taking care of people who sometimes can take care of themselves and 

416.32 417.00 A: yeah 

417.19 417.93 B: don't 

418.25 419.84 A: i agree with that too 

420.09 422.53 B: and i think that this whole you know it's 

435.96 436.47 B: and 

436.87 437.78 B: the ethical 

438.18 441.12 B: values have been so severely eroded 

441.42 447.30 A: uh-huh and i think that it's not only big business i think it's smaller government too 

445.07 445.35 B: hm 

447.45 448.18 B: mhm 

448.36 450.46 B: oh i'm sure it's it's i'm sure it it's 

448.40 448.86 A: because 

450.59 452.11 B: goes form top to bottom 

451.86 457.76 A: yes yes and i from being from a little town i see it right here in our little town 

457.76 458.23 B: mhm 

458.36 460.24 A: of corrupt government 

460.45 460.94 B: wow 

461.27 464.52 A: we've had a couple scandals here in our court house 

465.03 469.86 A: people using the funds to call their family to say marry christmas 

469.82 470.73 B: oh boy 

470.57 473.25 A: and things like this in just a small town 

473.36 474.26 B: oh my 

474.13 477.23 A: so i i'm i'm not thinking it's just 

477.34 479.49 A: big corporate businesses 

479.81 487.74 A: i'm thinking it's all the way and i think it is the attitude of a lot of people thinking they deserve everything 

487.94 488.34 B: yeah 

488.80 491.72 B: exactly it's an unfortunate attitude 

491.34 491.96 A: yes 

491.98 492.92 B: i'm wondering if 

494.14 496.84 B: what a solution is there doesn't 

496.93 497.58 B: definitely 

498.18 500.43 B: is a problem and i think most 

513.08 516.71 B: put a little but aside and that kind of stuff and the 

513.14 513.70 A: yeah 

517.13 518.01 B: the 

518.12 521.68 B: ones that don't feel that way are running (( )) 

521.19 521.84 A: yeah 

521.84 523.86 B: which is depressing 

524.24 534.90 A: well i i i and then i see today on the internet that record companies have been charging like my kids they buy c._d.'s and they buy records and 

534.25 534.90 B: mhm 

535.21 543.54 A: and they're charging a set amount so it can't go any lower the companies are getting together and there's now a big lawsuit over it 

539.42 540.13 B: mhm 

543.84 544.29 B: yeah 

544.61 549.77 B: well they're tying to fight for their lives because the internet because so many people have downloaded you know 

544.68 545.15 A: and 

549.59 550.72 A: off the internet 

550.49 552.02 B: off the internet so 

551.55 552.21 A: uh-huh 

552.26 553.33 B: you know they're kind of 

554.38 557.18 B: the rock and the hard place for those companies so 

556.71 557.68 A: yeah 

557.31 560.49 B: it's hard to say where you know 

560.12 561.89 A: where we're going to end up with that 

561.90 562.65 B: yeah 

562.47 563.34 A: and and 

562.77 567.07 B: what i'm just terrified is they're going to start taxing things on the internet and that 

566.66 573.65 A: you know i'm afraid of that too or some way i'm already paying nineteen dollars a month and 

572.71 573.06 B: mhm 

573.85 574.39 A: and 

574.77 576.43 A: i expect that to be 

576.61 577.49 A: raised 

577.58 578.14 B: mm 

577.77 578.58 A: and 

579.32 591.02 A: i just think that it's every place we look it's going to with this war it's going to really to sky rocket everything i have a son who works for a company that makes boat trailers 

591.13 591.63 B: mm 

591.77 593.40 A: and i'm thinking if 

593.60 596.79 A: if there's a war people are not going to buy boat trailers 

597.46 598.45 A: you know it's
