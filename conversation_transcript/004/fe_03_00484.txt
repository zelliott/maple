17.16 24.92 B: what do i think about that well i think that by virtue of where we live both you and i 

25.30 28.66 B: with the season especially going into winter time with the ah 

29.05 30.74 B: you know it gets cloudy and dreary 

31.18 33.11 B: sun doesn't shine half the time and

41.35 43.02 B: waiting for winter to get over with 

43.14 43.74 A: uh-huh 

43.93 44.67 B: but um

52.19 52.70 A: right 

52.95 56.08 B: i don't know how you you know handle it but that's how we handle it 

60.13 67.24 A: i don't get colds very often and i'm a single mom and i have a daughter who's eleven and i'm very blessed because she is very healthy 

67.14 67.86 B: oh yeah

70.99 71.54 A: school 

72.08 75.95 A: and um so we're just very lucky i guess we just have um 

76.16 78.34 A: we eat good make sure she eats a well bal- 

77.70 78.01 B: right 

78.51 81.01 A: balanced meal and i think that has a lot to do with it 

79.37 79.76 B: right 

80.78 85.39 B: you know it really does and getting the proper rest and so on um i have 

85.68 87.29 B: six grandchildren five of them are 

87.79 88.31 B: boys 

88.50 89.07 A: oh 

88.76 89.62 B: and ah 

90.04 94.08 B: ah one of them is here quit often he is just a little guy he's three and a half 

94.50 97.22 B: and i'll you what every time he gets sick he comes in here 

97.87 100.42 B: i'll pick it up from him because i know he gets it in the day care 

100.76 101.51 A: oh right 

101.07 102.41 B: and in ah 

101.81 104.74 A: and when they are that age they are very susceptible to that one 

104.04 104.53 B: ab- 

104.80 106.67 B: solut- isn't that right 

105.37 106.45 A: when they're at day care 

106.79 108.30 B: yeah in fact he's here right now 

108.50 109.19 A: oh 

108.69 112.83 B: and um he's got just a little a little temp- and a little cough again 

113.47 117.01 B: so i have to real careful because i don't want to pick it up i mean i get 

117.78 119.61 B: flu shots and stuff but ah 

119.25 120.86 A: oh do you really do you think it helps 

120.14 120.41 B: oh 

120.96 125.07 B: i i d- for the flu that the shot is for yes 

125.46 126.14 B: definitely 

125.62 128.81 A: oh okay cau- because there's so so many different kinds of flu 

126.54 127.46 B: it doesn't help 

128.04 130.62 B: right it doesn't help for that 

130.89 133.16 B: stomach twenty four forty eight hour thing 

133.22 133.54 A: oh 

133.40 135.23 B: that (( )) food type thing 

135.24 135.86 A: oh 

135.55 138.06 B: it's great for the upper respiratory type of flu 

138.53 141.57 B: but it doesn't do anything for that because i already had that flu 

141.82 146.89 B: and i did go to the doctor and he says well and i said so much for the shot and he said no this 

147.29 150.83 B: this is not the flu that you get the shot for which i was really 

149.64 150.47 A: oh 

151.68 153.16 B: not very pleased to hear but 

152.86 153.80 A: yeah 

153.83 154.45 B: um 

154.71 156.08 B: but you know relatively 

156.44 158.60 B: you know if if if you dress properly 

158.98 161.63 B: you know and you know you got to do that anyway 

162.11 164.53 B: my theory is if i keep my head covered i'm okay 

164.85 166.35 A: yeah that's true that helps 

165.81 166.12 B: (( )) 

166.58 167.23 B: keep warm 

167.48 169.52 B: and yeah you are very blessed if she's 

169.75 170.39 A: oh i am 

170.11 170.80 B: you know you 

171.20 173.21 B: you know well and you got to eat the proper foods 

173.40 174.67 A: right that definitely helps 

173.94 174.54 B: like you said 

175.28 175.99 B: and ah 

176.38 177.09 B: um 

177.20 181.51 B: you know we try to eat a healthy diet and and get your vegetables and fruits 

182.18 184.24 B: you know you don't get much fresh fruit now but 

185.22 186.35 B: whatever we can get 

186.47 188.46 B: you know without it costing an arm and a leg 

188.38 189.04 A: right 

188.97 189.59 B: but um 

190.15 196.41 B: yeah that's that's how we pretty much handle it i think we who live in the northern climes 

192.35 192.95 A: yeah 

197.52 199.44 B: are a little more conscience of it 

199.64 201.01 A: right i think we are 

201.20 202.32 B: um 

201.90 207.32 A: even though the flu's all over you know they they do get it in arizona and california 

203.64 204.45 B: right 

205.94 207.37 B: e- e- exactly 

207.58 212.03 B: exactly and you know what is a cold is a cold virus is a cold a 

212.50 213.27 B: ah 

213.40 213.74 B: you know 

214.06 216.45 B: is it just whatever and and there's just 

217.02 219.21 B: there's nothing you can do about it they get them all over the place 

220.21 222.12 B: and i'm not all together sure 

222.69 224.49 B: i mean people get colds in the summer time 

224.84 225.40 A: right 

225.59 227.07 A: you can get them anytime 

225.64 226.47 B: so you know 

227.39 228.84 B: it's it's hard to judge that 

228.62 231.81 A: sometime it's hard to differentiate whether it's the cold or the flu or 

231.73 232.20 B: mhm 

232.50 233.35 B: or allergies 

233.31 237.03 A: or ah or ah sinus infections i hear a lot of people get those 

237.12 241.13 B: ah yes yes and i happen to be one of them i'm very very proud to them 

240.82 241.97 A: oh yes some 

241.26 243.29 B: there's just nothing you can do about it you know and 

243.70 244.39 B: um 

245.35 247.62 B: like ah my doctor said you live in michigan 

248.35 249.00 B: and 

249.41 250.84 B: people in this area get 

251.08 253.06 B: a lot of that type of infection 

253.51 257.17 B: because by virtue of the dampness that we have around us here 

258.06 258.64 B: which 

258.94 259.47 B: um 

259.80 262.86 B: they said yeah this they find a lot of these you know the 

263.26 267.45 B: the north the central northern central states like we're considered or north 

267.68 271.91 B: hm i don't know what we're supposed to be considered i always thought we we're kind of east but 

272.54 278.41 B: ah ah well are you in northern ohio or southern ohio or you're in 

277.42 280.16 A: northern well i'm in cleveland or right near cleveland

280.27 280.71 A: yeah 

281.66 282.91 A: oh okay you're not to far 

282.42 285.00 B: so you get a lot the the lake effect stuff 

284.85 285.43 A: oh yeah 

285.79 286.72 B: and ah 

286.41 289.46 A: yeah we're not in the snow belt but ah you know the snow belts 

288.45 288.81 B: right 

289.59 294.46 A: what about thirty miles away from here i was like i would not want to be living in the snow belt 

293.22 296.25 B: no no no no as a matter of fact 

296.64 297.52 B: um 

297.78 300.20 B: we're in area we're in ah we're just 

300.44 301.05 B: ah 

301.29 303.07 B: west of detroit and 

303.46 304.49 B: we're at ah 

304.58 308.13 B: we're off of a road that is called eight mile road and 

308.54 309.56 B: it seems like 

309.69 310.93 B: we're the dividing line 

311.28 312.29 B: people south of us 

311.32 311.86 A: oh 

312.38 316.70 B: won't have an a drop of snow or rain or anything else and we're being buried 

316.91 318.98 B: you cross eight mile road and the weather changes 

317.07 318.09 A: oh 

319.52 320.66 A: is that weird 

319.52 320.87 B: just like there's this curtain 

321.16 323.09 B: that lifts and here you are 

323.34 323.73 B: so 

323.51 325.60 A: ah so you get a lot of snow where you're at 

325.42 328.39 B: um we get a lot of snow but the last 

328.59 331.17 B: couple of years we've only had a couple real good 

331.71 332.25 B: um 

332.88 334.08 B: dumping of snow 

334.20 334.95 A: uh-huh 

334.69 336.61 B: and we had snow very early this year 

337.24 337.89 A: oh 

337.53 339.77 B: um we had it you know for thanksgiving 

340.64 341.11 B: which is 

341.95 343.01 B: really unusual 

343.52 344.31 B: and ah 

344.82 345.51 B: but you know 

346.23 347.09 B: the way it goes 

347.72 348.30 A: uh-huh 

347.81 352.06 B: you live with it as long as you have too i guess i'm going to have to for a little while longer 

351.51 355.22 A: yeah oh yeah i i like the snow and i like the winter 

355.55 357.86 A: and i don't complain about because i 

357.96 360.38 A: i get a little bit upset when people complain about it because 

360.64 362.23 A: it's like it's ohio weather 

362.49 371.42 A: you know this is where you live you just have to accept it you deal with it you know if you don't like it move to florida or move to california i like the change of seasons 

363.98 364.34 B: yeah 

364.61 364.94 B: yeah 

365.91 366.64 B: exactly 

368.89 370.10 B: ew yeah 

371.63 372.13 A: and i just 

371.72 372.07 B: well 

372.30 373.32 B: you know i don't mind 

372.40 373.56 A: you just have to deal with it 

373.55 374.89 B: you know i don't mind winter 

375.30 376.54 B: as long as the sun shines 

377.25 381.19 A: you know we have sunny days sometimes we had one today it was sunny ah yeah 

378.78 380.39 B: yeah well we had one today 

381.22 385.96 B: well that's it i i can handle i can handle five degrees above zero 

381.90 382.50 A: you know 

386.57 387.53 B: if the sunny is shining 

388.18 389.98 A: right that definitely helps 

389.44 394.93 B: and and you know that's of course that's all a mental thing too you know you know but it's it's 

393.10 393.96 A: yeah 

395.07 395.93 B: still very 

396.52 397.07 B: um 

397.84 400.71 B: very prevalent and what it does also do is 

401.43 404.39 B: if if you let it take you over 

404.80 406.60 B: then you can get sick too 

406.89 407.46 A: uh-huh 

407.29 408.54 B: i've heard of people who get 

408.27 408.74 A: right 

408.83 411.89 B: so emotionally rapped up in this 

408.88 409.41 A: you get 

409.83 410.49 A: yeah 

412.39 414.89 B: dreary i mean when it gets dreary i turn on the lights 

415.48 416.09 A: yeah 

415.53 416.38 B: that's all you can do 

416.43 422.20 A: i do too that's why our electric bill is high in the winter but oh well but no you're right i think some people 

419.23 420.71 B: yeah 

422.30 431.13 A: um let let the dreariness get to them and they get depressed and they get sad and then they get runned down and their more susceptible to getting sick and 

429.71 430.10 B: right 

431.17 432.79 B: and it is a vicious circle 

432.93 433.64 A: yeah 

433.72 434.87 B: it certainly is 

434.89 439.59 A: and just have to you know make the most of it and you you've got to figure six months it's going to be 

435.89 436.42 B: yeah

470.08 473.34 B: but we've gotten we've been kind of in the warm belt where we've been missed 

474.61 476.59 B: by a lot of the stuff that's hit ohio
