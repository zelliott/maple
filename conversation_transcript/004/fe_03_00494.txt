200.24 201.18 A: you know we'd we'd do 

201.45 204.89 A: little bit of school in the morning you know just some math facts and that kind of thing and then we'd we 

205.04 206.69 B: or your kids don't get a sick of it and if they're

210.32 211.38 A: um actually we 

211.69 215.87 A: here when we're at home we we have quite a bit of contact cause we we do a home school coop 

216.17 216.83 B: oh okay 

217.21 217.96 A: so um 

218.67 219.68 A: eh you know two 

220.02 223.55 A: two or three four days a week depending on you know what classes you're taking with people 

224.06 224.41 A: um 

225.15 227.46 A: (( )) they're around kids an awful lot 

227.02 230.35 B: yeah so they still get sick 

228.08 229.23 A: well 

230.01 231.23 A: yeah they still get sick 

231.39 231.76 B: yeah 

231.73 232.59 A: they all just kind of 

233.50 233.87 A: you know 

235.82 236.89 A: out out there 

237.61 238.12 B: yeah 

238.25 238.96 A: and around 

242.99 244.80 A: and people here get a lo- really sick cause we're 

244.98 246.37 A: (( senta )) valley so this is where 

246.84 249.62 A: you know like all the tomatoes are the cantaloupe you know they 

249.90 250.21 B: hm 

250.23 251.45 A: a lot of agriculture here 

251.49 251.88 B: right 

252.33 252.80 A: and so they 

252.96 253.57 A: spray 

254.38 254.79 A: um 

255.25 257.94 A: and there's just tons of chemicals in our air it's really scary 

258.77 259.30 A: um 

259.72 261.04 A: so that really 

261.51 261.98 A: um 

263.31 264.55 A: you know just sets people off 

265.13 265.41 B: hm 

265.42 266.87 A: in terms of being sick 

267.16 267.53 B: right 

267.63 268.19 B: right 

267.70 269.58 A: like even if you've had a cold 

270.39 272.66 A: (( )) whatever's in the air is an irritant 

273.56 276.45 A: and they just kind of make sure colds last longer does that make sense 

276.65 277.82 B: huh okay yeah 

277.74 279.98 A: uh like like produces like an asthma kind of 

280.02 280.52 B: right 

280.63 281.06 A: problem 

281.27 281.52 B: huh 

282.02 285.38 A: my husband has that it's like he'll done fine except when he gets a cold 

285.73 288.07 A: and he starts having problem with asthma because of all the 

288.52 289.46 A: the garbage (( )) 

289.66 290.34 A: in our air 

291.37 291.62 B: hm 

292.15 299.80 B: yeah we don't have that problem here that i know of anyways we had some spring last year whenever was nervous about uh well you have the west nile virus around here for the mosquitoes 

299.27 300.79 A: oh uh-huh 

300.37 307.29 B: and they were doing some spraying for that and uh a lot of people were very nervous about you know they don't know i mean what the effects of uh you know spraying those chemicals are 

307.40 307.97 B: but uh 

307.52 307.89 A: yeah 

308.70 309.20 B: but uh 

308.90 309.17 A: yeah 

309.32 312.85 B: they still did it and uh people went in there house and hid basically you know 

310.84 311.21 A: yeah 

312.64 313.09 A: now 

313.52 314.00 A: now that 

314.18 315.80 A: once it freezes 

317.34 317.91 A: um 

318.18 319.20 A: are all those mosquitoes 

320.17 321.88 A: that they there won't be another problem with the west 

322.49 322.87 A: (( )) 

323.02 324.26 A: nile virus will there 

324.32 329.46 B: well it's yeah continues every year i mean it seems to be getting worse and worse as uh it's spreading um 

329.72 333.21 A: so even when they lie dormant (( )) i mean the the eggs they they still carry the virus 

334.03 337.89 B: i don't know how it works uh was i guess they get the virus from uh (( )) like 

338.26 341.57 B: other animals like birds like the crows and stuff like that get it 

340.92 342.79 A: okay so even if the mosquitoes die off it 

342.88 344.32 A: still the big animals that have it 

344.05 347.56 B: i thi- i guess yeah i'm not a hundred percent sure how that works but yeah yeah 

346.25 346.54 A: okay 

347.80 350.20 A: yeah cause that came up a while back 

350.54 350.96 A: um 

350.57 352.08 B: yeah it's spreading i guess uh 

352.06 353.17 A: oh that's not good 

352.69 353.57 B: (( )) yeah 

354.38 354.70 A: hm 

356.33 356.82 A: anyway 

358.40 360.13 B: so that we're supposed to be talking about uh 

358.49 359.02 A: um 

360.26 363.44 B: let's see what are we supposed to be i guess uh illnesses and how we uh 

361.80 362.59 A: the seasons 

363.79 364.09 A: yes 

364.47 364.94 B: yeah 

364.53 365.94 A: how we cope with that 

365.43 375.98 B: yeah how we cope with it yeah i know one thing i do is i take vitamins you know a lot more vitamins i guess to try to cope with it (( you know )) i read up on the vitamin c. and you know it's (( )) supposed to help with colds so i try to take 

371.06 371.52 A: yeah 

374.79 375.18 A: mhm 

375.54 380.65 A: now as soon as you start feeling it do you go ahead and and pump up on like the echinacea and the vitamin c. and 

381.36 382.00 A: all that 

386.38 386.69 A: mhm 

389.85 393.22 A: yeah cause that's why my husband wou- and i both take vitamins and stuff but 

393.53 394.38 A: i just take them 

395.31 396.41 A: you know just everyday 

396.75 399.96 A: but he'll do that he'll take like you know four times dosage 

400.25 400.54 A: of 

400.73 402.29 A: vitamin c. for that day 

402.15 403.23 B: yeah 

402.39 404.86 A: or echina- he swears it works so 

404.38 407.18 B: yeah well it seems to help it really does so 

406.74 409.30 A: yeah and he'll do the same for the echinacea 

407.41 407.94 B: yeah 

409.81 412.21 A: was like you know what is that doing to your system 

411.89 417.99 B: yeah i know that's the only thing i guess is but it it seems to help you know even if it's psychological as long as it you know 

418.18 419.57 B: wards off the cold right 

418.44 418.88 A: true 

420.36 420.71 A: true

422.83 424.37 B: and i got a flu shot this year to

441.00 441.61 A: oh that's good 

442.24 448.04 B: um our our our work actually offers it for uh no charge to us so i you might as well take advantage of it 

442.75 443.13 A: yeah 

446.43 446.77 A: mhm 

448.27 448.93 A: well yeah

452.27 452.65 B: mhm 

452.73 454.30 A: you know cause they really push the elderly 

454.51 455.16 B: right 

454.98 455.31 A: um 

455.44 456.14 A: where we are

460.26 462.24 A: at the supermarket and stuff like that 

462.93 464.93 A: and and do them for free for the elderly but 

466.00 467.01 A: so far i haven't had one 

467.50 472.41 B: yeah yeah i probably wouldn't go out of my way to get one but you know since they bring it right in to my office and you know 

472.96 473.28 B: you just 

473.57 475.92 B: yeah just go down the you know the hall and they 

476.05 483.47 B: give you a shot so but i don't thing i would've uh taken time off from work or or paid to go do it you know right right 

480.41 481.40 A: yeah to 

481.53 482.93 A: to go do that i know 

483.78 485.13 B: but it seems to help i mean 

485.40 490.94 B: my my wife also got the flu shot she works over in the uh hospital and they give them flu shots too and uh 

490.93 491.34 A: mhm 

491.62 494.67 B: yeah so i mean she's been getting it for lon- longer than i have though 

492.52 493.15 A: well yeah cause it's 

495.34 495.69 A: yeah 

499.22 499.53 A: hm 

501.61 503.27 A: so how did you find out about this study

505.44 506.08 A: well me too 

506.20 506.54 B: yeah 

507.55 508.13 A: i guess pretty much 

508.69 509.53 B: probably that's uh 

509.72 511.45 B: yeah maybe everybody found out that way 

511.74 512.35 A: mhm 

512.10 515.02 B: i thought i didn't know we'd be talking to uh you know somebody else uh 

515.14 517.25 B: i thought we'd be talking to somebody at the school you know 

517.38 519.04 B: i wasn't sure how that was going to work 

517.40 519.02 A: yeah like a a researcher 

519.13 519.85 A: i didn't realize 

520.12 520.43 A: yeah 

520.59 520.99 B: yeah 

520.68 525.84 A: i knew they said they would be recording it but i thought it would be you know question and answer kind of thing not necessarily 

525.18 525.68 B: right 

526.33 526.74 A: and 

527.31 527.68 A: come to 

528.34 529.39 B: this is different anyways 

528.36 529.13 A: (( contact )) (( )) 

529.50 529.84 B: yeah 

529.54 531.09 A: with cold contact with a stranger 

531.19 533.70 B: yeah right 

534.11 535.72 A: talk about pressure 

535.83 536.27 B: yeah 

536.49 536.87 B: well 

536.62 536.94 A: hm 

536.98 539.30 B: oh guess what we supposed to talk for half an hour was that what it 

540.04 540.99 A: i don't know 

541.28 542.49 B: that's what i was wondering 

543.25 543.62 A: um 

543.81 545.08 A: perhaps they will beep 

547.32 547.59 A: hm 

550.07 550.78 A: well 

551.04 553.38 B: wonder if they're going to have any more questions to pop in or 

554.92 556.12 A: i don't know 

556.56 563.56 B: i mean are we i mean what are you i mean it's a well how you ward off illness but how much can you talk about you know that for uh if you do have to talk for half an hour 

563.61 564.09 A: mhm 

566.92 571.44 B: i mean cause i don't do anything special you know like i said i take vitamins i got the flu shot and you know
