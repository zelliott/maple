0.97 4.04 A: hi i'm dolores degarca who's this 

3.51 5.28 B: this is carol waldrop 

4.76 6.18 A: (( hi how are you )) 

5.81 7.34 B: good how 'bout you 

6.86 8.24 A: (( good [mn] )) 

7.82 11.21 B: so what do you think do you get sick when the seasons change 

10.62 13.24 A: um i take a lot of vitamin c. [laughter] 

13.04 14.27 B: oh so that 

13.34 14.63 A: (( so no [laughter] )) 

14.59 16.41 B: that keeps you healthy 

15.99 17.07 A: yes 

17.10 26.08 B: oh now i live in florida so we don't get major changes of season but i've noticed in the fall a lot of people down here tend to get ill 

26.49 29.85 B: i i think there's a lot of mold in the air 

29.73 36.19 A: yes well that uh my mother lives in florida and you guys get you know you have to have air conditioning and everything so 

35.37 37.17 B: yeah 

36.32 39.20 A: when you turn that off it it grows mold doesn't it 

39.12 43.00 B: i think so and it's um we get a lot of rain in the fall 

43.04 44.75 B: and when it's rainy 

45.24 51.20 B: the all that stuff you'd think it would clean the air out but it seems like all that stuff grows really quickly 

50.83 54.44 A: right well i'm from new york so we're used to all the changes 

54.58 57.24 A: it's like four different seasons and 

57.00 58.24 B: yeah 

57.58 59.20 A: you get used to it 

59.97 62.65 A: so we don't i don't really get too many colds either 

60.05 61.09 B: yeah 

62.70 71.99 B: oh no i i generally can say i don't get many colds and i've lived all over the world but this past year i've gotten a lot of colds [mn] 

71.84 74.18 A: do you work out at the gym a lot 

73.97 75.15 B: excuse me 

74.56 75.92 A: do you go to a gym 

75.83 79.75 B: um i don't go to a gym i walk about four miles a day 

79.60 82.86 A: because sometimes when you go to the gym you get a lot of colds 

83.41 86.35 A: [noise] i find when i go to like a public gym 

83.59 84.43 B: yeah i 

86.17 87.11 B: uh-huh 

86.84 89.17 A: i get i tend to get more colds 

89.66 101.75 B: yeah that would make sense i used to work in an elementary school and when i was around the kids i would pick up everything that went around the school including strep throat and my doctor would say it was so unusual for 

101.89 105.98 B: adults to get strep throat that my kids should be the ones with it [laughter] 

102.89 103.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

105.51 115.67 A: right no my kids are pretty good they usually don't get uh you know they're all in elementary school but they they i always get notices that they're around strep throat but they haven't gotten it yet i 

115.79 124.59 B: oh they're fortunate very fortunate my my kids um my kids are grown now they're in [mn] one is in college and one teaches high school 

115.91 116.77 A: (( you know )) 

117.84 119.26 A: (( [noise] yes [noise] )) 

124.66 128.88 B: but when they were um young they hardly ever got sick 

129.04 132.62 B: uh i think my son went five years with perfect attendance 

132.61 136.07 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] that's how my kids are i wonder why i guess uh 

132.64 133.52 B: when he 

136.17 144.63 A: i don't really i i think it depend- depends on your own immune system or something i don't know because all of my kids have had like perfect attendance i think 

141.40 142.34 B: (( yeah and yet )) 

144.66 150.67 A: uh my son's in fifth grade and he missed one day in six in five years six years so 

148.86 159.69 B: wow that's impressive i know my when my son finally broke his record he was in seventh grade and he had flu so bad he could hardly move and he 

158.16 162.29 A: really did they give him an award or something for doing that that was great 

161.70 165.21 B: you know he really didn't get it because we were in the air force 

165.28 168.21 B: so he was in several different school districts 

167.62 169.43 A: oh so they wouldn't have known 

169.00 180.86 B: yeah i i don't think anyone ever really realized it and it i don't think he ever either of my kids ever missed more than two days in a school year you know i but i think a lot of people keep their kids home 

171.91 172.72 A: (( wow [noise] )) 

180.77 184.11 B: if they have just the slightest little um sniffle 

183.90 189.66 A: yeah i think that has to do with it too because i'm like really strict they really have to be sick [noise] to be home you know 

189.36 196.68 B: yeah i i was that way and i was raised that way too i i grew up in um the chicago area and 

196.79 207.32 B: it gets very very cold there in the wintertime and so many people would stay home let their kids stay home if the weather was bad and they just had the slightest sniffle or 

207.44 211.90 B: or um cough and my mom's theory was that the cold killed the germs 

211.95 213.70 A: oh right okay that's true 

213.80 223.75 A: because i had somebody who told me that once that you could go out in freezing weather with uh step into water and you won't get won't get a cold it's from uh people that you get a cold 

223.02 224.90 B: [mn] yeah i think that's true 

224.17 225.34 A: (( [mn] )) 

225.18 229.93 B: and i i really don't know um how the change of seasons really affects 

230.07 232.71 B: colds in general i think it has more to do with 

232.10 236.97 A: well maybe if you under dress and overdress that might have a little more to do with it i don't know 

237.17 239.29 B: that could be uh 

239.58 242.09 B: i know a lot of people from down here 

242.13 251.93 B: are originally from the north east and they go home for christmas or thanksgiving to visit their family and when they come back they almost always seem to have a cold and i 

251.03 254.49 A: because it's like a change in climate and 

253.61 255.86 B: yeah i i think you don't know how 

254.77 261.23 A: jetlag and all of that i i really think the only way you usually get a cold is if you're like run down 

256.48 257.84 B: (( right [mn] )) 

261.41 263.09 B: yeah well i think that's been my 

263.18 273.84 B: why i've gotten colds so much this past year because i've i really never get sick and i've been shocked when i get colds and i've had two really bad colds in this past year 

273.27 275.98 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] there may be a lot of stress too )) 

275.91 277.58 B: yeah i i have i 

277.77 279.05 B: i'm the ultimate 

279.09 281.39 B: burn the candle at both ends person 

281.01 282.04 A: right 

281.71 284.80 B: and every once in a while i guess it has to catch up with me 

285.10 285.98 B: (( you know )) 

285.27 288.57 A: i don't usually get a cold i get like psoriasis 

288.32 289.50 B: oh do you 

289.00 291.07 A: because of the stress i do 

291.19 304.09 A: so when i'm like low key and i don't have a lot of stress it it doesn't bother me and then when i'm like under high stress it flares up it's the weirdest thing i don't usually get the colds and i really don't catch a lot of what the kids have either 

303.88 305.35 B: oh you're lucky 

304.73 305.68 A: (( you know )) 

305.38 306.65 B: very lucky 

306.00 310.19 A: but like i said they don't really get you know sick too often either 

310.06 318.41 B: uh now it's interesting you said the psoriasis because my husband and my twenty five year old daughter both have had psoriasis for years um 

318.55 327.04 B: since we've moved to florida five years ago i don't think either of them has had a real flare up except for my daughter once during final exams in college 

326.39 329.70 A: see it's the stress i really believe that's true you know 

329.35 343.96 B: yeah it it definitely was with her because she was so embarrassed because her she got it all in her scalp and it looked like she had this major major dandruff where she usually gets it in her um just above her nose and in in the center of her forehead when she gets it 

334.90 337.06 A: [noise] 

344.10 354.18 A: i usually get it really bad when my um we had money problems a couple of years back and now it's like so it's not as bad you see it like patches it depends on your level 

354.42 357.27 A: i guess i don't know your level of stress or whatever 

357.21 358.82 B: yeah 

357.49 358.61 A: but um 

358.94 364.02 A: i just stopped going to the gym in the winter because of the colds i figured you know 

364.20 368.24 A: i would be sick every other week so i wasn't really getting my full workout 

369.09 373.76 B: that makes sense tha- that you you would get sick from gym do you 

372.99 380.16 A: so but you do a lot of jogging and stuff [noise] and you do so you do a lot of str- um sweating [noise] and stuff but you don't get colds 

379.58 385.23 B: no i i uh i mostly do uh fast the fast walking like speed walks 

384.93 386.36 A: oh right okay 

385.74 400.19 B: and because it's less stressful on your joints and i in the summer we have a pool i mean we have a pool all year long but when the weather's warmer i swim laps a lot for exercise so i really never go to the gym anymore uh when we lived 

388.24 389.24 A: right 

400.23 405.23 B: places where we didn't have a [mn] a nice an area to walk around i used to go to the gym 

404.94 406.64 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

405.28 413.98 B: but we have several pieces of gym equipment in the house and with the pool i really can get a good aerobic workout without having to leave the house 

409.44 411.32 A: [noise] 

414.77 415.68 B: so that's 

414.92 418.33 A: 'cause my mother used to say like if you work out and you sweat 

418.37 424.91 A: that that might cause you to get a cold if you if you allow yourself to stay wet and maybe not take a shower or whatever 

425.06 433.82 B: that that makes sense because when you get overheated and your body has sweats on it um even if it's cold outside sometimes you get that overheated feeling 

433.35 434.28 A: (( right mhm )) 

433.71 446.26 B: i always sne- start to sneeze i won't necessarily have a cold but it'll start a sneeze reflex and i'll sneeze two or three times and i know i have to take my jacket off or something to cool off a little bit and then i'm fine 

446.73 449.67 A: but really all i've been doing this winter is um 

449.70 452.35 A: like eating an orange everyday practically 

452.28 453.83 B: oh that's a good thing 

453.42 456.62 A: you know or drinking orange juice or something like that 

456.68 462.79 B: yeah that sounds like a real good thing are you are you in upstate new york where it's really cold or new york city area 

461.43 464.84 A: no i'm in um like long island new york 

464.57 468.81 B: oh okay i i lived in new jersey for ten years 

465.72 466.51 A: so 

466.99 470.31 A: but it's freezing i mean today it's like almost zero 

469.98 475.03 B: yeah well if it makes you feel better we only got up to like sixty degrees near sixty 

473.26 481.10 A: i my mother moved to florida like two years ago and the last couple of winters uh have been pretty cold for florida 

480.51 486.72 B: yeah well it always gets um in my experience it always gets cold for maybe three weeks 

486.77 500.99 B: um not necessarily cold enough that you have to wear a a jacket like it is now but cold enough that you can't wear shorts but this winter uh i have friends that have lived down here thirty and forty years and they say this is the worst winter that they can remember 

501.24 502.84 B: so it's it's pretty 

501.85 510.28 A: that's what my mother's been saying i think it's like the ozone layers shifting or something that we're getting warmer weather and you guys are getting colder weather 

510.15 511.39 B: yeah 

510.63 515.88 A: because really this has been like the only cold day this year it hasn't really been cold 

515.48 517.71 B: oh my you're lucky 

516.54 521.98 A: i mean it's been cold but not like our normal winters that we used to get 

519.83 521.01 B: (( oh is )) 

521.41 524.24 B: is your mom in in south florida or 

523.30 525.21 A: she's in naples 

524.63 532.87 B: oh that's almost direct i'm on the ocean side um just up from west palm beach so that's almost directly across just a little further south i think 

532.17 533.30 A: mhm 

532.92 534.27 B: than where we are 

534.29 539.09 A: and i went there this summer i was there and i was surprised at how cold it got at night 

539.26 547.28 B: yeah well [mn] i think it gets they get more extremes on the gulf coast [mn] it it it gets hotter there too in the summer than we get we we're um 

547.63 562.42 B: almost always in the winter it gets up to at least the mid seventies in the middle of the day and in the evening it generally doesn't go below forty but it has this week we had frost warnings this week and we live right where they grow all the indian river grapefruit 

562.13 563.12 A: right 

562.99 564.09 B: (( so a a lo- )) 

563.27 568.41 A: so you would think 'cause you have like more even weather that you wouldn't get many colds 

567.64 572.29 B: no but the the pollen is very bad and that triggers colds sometimes 

570.97 573.22 A: it's the mold too yeah i'm sure 

572.83 584.01 B: yeah in the um spring there's a lot of pine trees around here and the pollen is so thick that you can actually see it on your car you'll have a yellow dusting on your car 

581.27 582.56 A: (( really )) 

583.39 584.26 A: mhm 

584.06 590.09 B: but [mn] uh pine trees are native trees down here and the town i live in is um 

590.17 599.89 B: there's a lot of vacant lots still a lot of open area so there's a lot of trees and i've noticed when the pollen gets bad like that even people who don't have aller- 

593.05 594.10 A: right
