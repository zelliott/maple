10.89 16.60 A: uh what do you feel a- uh how do you feel about what's your opinion about what's happening in the middle east right now 

16.61 21.94 B: i think it's ridiculous and i think it's just another way for america to try and gain power over other countries 

21.73 33.42 A: my sentiments exactly i i feel that uh we hadn't we hadn't uh been having a reason to be there we have enough unrest right here in this country issues that need to be resolved 

33.59 35.35 B: yeah i agree and i feel like 

35.57 42.92 B: i feel like president bush is crazy i feel like he's going after this guy because the guy wanted to go after his father i feel like 

43.22 47.64 B: i'm i'm hoping that the i feel like it's getting kind of scary because the world doesn't even know 

48.05 55.71 B: why like doesn't even know how corrupt america is like when september eleventh occurred people were wondering why it happened but like 

55.72 64.44 B: made them it made them want to fight the other country more but it made me realize look i realized just how bad america has been to other countries 

64.07 67.59 A: exactly so the chickens have come home to roost 

67.63 79.50 B: exactly and it's like america is not learning its lesson it wants to be the supreme power over every place and i feel like like i'm having conversations with other people and it's like if america really cared about the weapons they would have gone to i think it's 

68.62 69.53 A: mhm 

79.64 92.51 B: japan or hong kong i forget which which asian country but they would have gone there uh no i think it's north korea to um gain their weapons because they have um weapons of mass destruction there that can hurt america the same way even more than um 

92.66 97.56 B: iraq has but america is going there because iraq has oil and they want to gain power over iraq 

97.17 102.60 A: yes i think i agree i think it's totally about resources and retaliation 

103.23 108.49 A: i really do and i from a biblical point of view i do see prophecy unfolding 

108.78 110.48 A: i do see prophecy 

109.76 111.66 B: how how is it biblical 

111.89 119.65 A: uh as far as prophecy i uh as far as prophecy is concerned that's the reference i'm making ah 

114.20 115.13 B: yeah 

119.20 121.62 B: (( what do you mean as far as prophecy is concerned )) 

121.67 130.33 A: as far as what uh christ predicted would be happening at this time nation rising against nation and wars and wars 

130.25 142.85 A: and i feel that the prophecy is actually unfolding in fact we're actually getting a chance to live we're seeing prophecy unfolding and that's book of revelations so therefore i while i while i don't 

130.62 131.43 B: mhm 

142.82 147.99 A: understand what's going on to some degree from a biblical point of view i do 

148.94 151.00 B: can you explain a little more about that 

151.59 164.85 A: uh the things that are happening now it's hap- uh if we familiarize ourselves with the book of revelations we will find that a number of events that have been predicted are happening uh the earthquakes uh 

165.32 176.80 A: uh uh weather patterns all of these things are are fully described in the book of revelations also if you go into matthew twenty four fourteen you will see uh 

176.85 189.05 A: a lot of the things that jesus foretold would happen and uh what we called the end times and and we see them unfold every day so when we uh look look at what has happened in iraq 

189.02 193.27 A: i don't know if we should really you know i can't personally question 

193.34 199.10 A: why it's happening because it's been uh prophec- you know prophecy is unfolding as i see it 

200.06 202.14 B: mm that's very interesting 

202.11 203.25 A: mhm 

203.46 209.36 A: but uh as far as peace is concerned in that area i i don't know um 

209.38 212.98 A: i really don't know because now we're talking about syria aren't we 

213.52 216.18 B: oh i didn't hear about syria what are they saying about syria 

216.04 226.16 A: as far as i well maybe i'm ahead of myself but um i think that s- some time in some way that syria syria i'm sorry you know is 

225.99 226.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

226.44 229.28 A: maybe another target eventually 

229.59 232.91 A: for u- for the united states invasion process 

233.79 234.67 B: (( mm )) 

235.79 248.77 A: but peace uh the scripture does say will come a time where they will declare peace and security so [mn] i i believe i believe that it might be that it will be peace in fact one day 

249.51 251.27 B: (( mm yeah )) 

251.29 253.51 B: [noise] but i don't know i feel like 

253.87 267.28 B: honestly it's i don't know i'm not sure about the peace happening because i feel like america is getting extremely overbearing with their power and i'm a bit afraid of like where they're going to try and go next you know and 

265.96 267.44 A: (( bu- mhm )) 

268.23 279.26 B: p- and like america people in america just sitting tight thinking nothing can happen to them because they're not getting bombed every day but like imagine the children that are like getting killed you know america's like building 

277.91 280.08 A: exactly mhm 

279.44 281.45 B: hospitals you know and it's like 

282.01 284.75 B: things have gone worse than i can even imagine 

284.56 285.65 A: mhm 

285.07 297.81 B: so it's like i am afraid for what may happen you know like of course i shouldn't be afraid because i'm like and i should be afraid of things that can happen the next day but it's like just imagine the things that people will do to us now 

291.89 292.99 A: mhm 

297.60 298.93 A: that's true 

297.76 312.29 B: i mean american didn't bomb america was bombing places like before september eleven but think of what they plan on doing to us now i mean they got us september eleventh think of what they're going to try and get with us next because america is like is really taking advantage of its power 

304.73 305.91 A: that's true 

306.93 308.03 A: mhm 

312.24 316.37 B: the u._n. told america not to go and america said we're going to go in without you you know 

316.09 330.47 A: mhm actually i saw that in in a way as the fall of the united nations the beginning of of the fall of the united nations if they're going to be totally ignored then what what purp- what you know what purpose are they will they be able to serve in the future 

330.37 331.40 B: mhm 

331.40 332.83 A: so um 

333.43 339.61 A: it's it's just really sad and it's unfortunate that uh this has happened and like you uh 

339.51 340.36 B: (( what )) 

340.07 345.87 A: anything co- is possible particularly after when we observe the events events of september eleventh 

346.47 347.24 A: (( i know )) 

348.20 349.92 B: did you say about september eleventh 

350.07 358.16 A: when we when we reflect upon what happened september the eleventh it is scary in light of the the uh current uh situation in the east 

358.12 363.06 A: uh it is scary and i cannot imagine our children being that terrified 

362.95 366.86 A: you know or all the suffering that's involved 

363.26 363.96 B: (( mhm )) 

366.71 378.48 A: all the things that that we gloss over every day or take for granted every day we have uh you know uh running water and and and uh other conditions here we have food and we're not 

378.52 391.33 A: uh our pla- our homes have have not been um destroyed or bombed or anything so we have a lot to be thankful for in addition to the concerns uh the other uh things that are happening 

392.74 397.41 B: well do do have you ever been involved in one of these conversations before 

397.17 398.08 A: no 

398.88 401.84 A: [laughter] no and i think this is the answer to say no i haven't 

402.20 403.19 B: mhm 

404.59 405.86 B: okay 

405.89 407.59 A: (( how how about you )) 

407.87 412.35 B: no i'm kind of figuring out what exactly like they're looking for in the conversations 

412.47 419.19 A: well i've found this conver- our conversation quite interesting and inform- informative i could 

418.26 419.17 B: yeah 

419.32 422.32 A: we do a- we we do agree on a number of things 

422.06 425.36 B: yeah i'm wondering if they were expecting us to disagree you know 

425.17 427.40 A: [laughter] 

425.55 428.10 B: and to show like how [noise] 

428.30 429.24 B: (( a couple of )) 

429.58 431.63 B: like you know go at it but 

430.55 431.48 A: mhm 

431.78 444.56 B: i think it extraordinarily enough like i feel like though like you're going to have like strong opinions on it i feel like the world really doesn't i don't know sometimes i feel like people really do not agree with the war but then i realize that like 

437.64 438.54 A: mhm 

444.95 453.52 B: it's like people use the same exact reason to agree with the war that people use to disagree like they try and say we should have war because of september eleventh but then i think well like 

449.86 450.95 A: mhm 

453.36 467.23 B: exactly is why we shouldn't have war is because of september eleventh you know because it just shows america abuses its power but everyone else who's blind and doesn't pay attention to news just says america needs to do this because other countries are terrible and horrid you know 

456.22 457.20 A: mhm 

466.96 467.97 A: right 

468.17 469.40 A: i agree 

468.41 472.85 B: like this this country has a lack has a lack of knowledge they are very ignorant 

472.88 475.08 B: and they don't take time to like read 

475.17 480.93 B: news and like educate themselves on stuff that's happening the only time they care is when it's for- when they're forced to see it 

481.29 482.81 A: that is so true 

483.01 487.33 A: that is so true well see my from my observation people 

487.37 500.03 A: don't want to read they want somebody to tell them [laughter] you know they want to be told and and and i think basically uh that's what keeps everybody going everyone's different ah 

491.12 492.17 B: yeah 

499.96 505.49 A: view of world conditions be it uh the war or the the 

505.51 511.05 A: uh tornados or what- whatever um it makes life interesting it 

511.45 518.99 A: really does just having different opinions about you know any different suppose everybody felt the same way about everything 

519.85 520.83 B: mhm 

521.02 523.65 A: no-one would learn from the other person 

523.91 538.31 B: yeah it's true but i just still think that people are very stupid to really even think that we should be at war right now and for like if the rich people weren't just sitting tight on their money and had to go fight the war they'd definitely have a different opinion on that issue 

539.47 540.44 A: well 

539.71 553.91 B: and i mean it's like people go fight war because people go to the army because they need money for school they need money for so many other things and i feel as though if people needed money to fight in the war and had to go fight themselves instead of just saying yeah we should fight and not be on the battleground themselves 

553.82 555.42 B: they'd think differently 

555.94 564.46 B: you know they're just quick they're quicker to say we shouldn't fight just because they're not out there fighting or they don't have any connections to someone who is fighting 

564.42 565.59 A: that's right 

565.90 576.65 A: and they don't realize the impact o- on on lives uh parents are losing sons and husbands and wives and families families are really being torn apart 

572.52 573.69 B: exactly 

576.28 577.50 B: exactly 

577.02 578.10 A: mhm 

578.04 580.91 B: (( people show up in the news every day )) 

581.07 582.31 B: with um 

583.32 597.21 B: stories of how their son died perfect person was going to go to college you know and their life was just taken away because america just wants to abuse the power and there's so many other problems going on they spent a hundred and fifty billion dollars on the war 

598.50 599.55 A: now 

598.72 599.89 B: on the war
