21.53 22.51 A: hello 

22.22 23.40 B: hello

33.73 34.76 A: hello 

34.43 36.38 B: how many people am i talking to 

36.38 37.57 A: just one 

37.86 40.60 B: jim you said your name is okay 

38.89 39.81 A: right 

41.01 43.69 B: so what do you think about the middle east jim 

43.42 53.75 A: well i think it's a problem that's gonna be drawn out for many years and many years and i'm not sure it's gonna be solved a hundred percent fashion 

53.91 57.01 B: right i i tend to agree with that i think that ah 

57.26 68.26 B: right now we're not in a good situation to solve things i think that nothing's gonna get done as long as um sharon's in power in israel and as long as bush is in power here 

68.39 72.98 A: i got a similar feeling about it very nearly identical 

73.18 80.17 B: right i mean yeah i i was um [lipsmack] in israel i guess about nineteen ninety four ninety five um 

80.37 84.24 B: everything was looking good over there you know i mean ah 

84.37 87.76 B: sharon i mean rabin had been assassinated but ah 

87.86 101.58 B: yeah it was during the clinton administration and they were they were talking peace at least and ah they didn't have all the suicide bombers and everything going on on there and of course it was before nine eleven and um there was a much more peaceful time i think that ah 

101.68 108.86 B: yeah i think if clinton had had some more time and and the israelis had stuck with barak i think um we might have gotten somewhere 

108.80 122.40 A: yeah i believe it would have been a better situation than we're facing now for sure it's like a lot of these countries are taking advantage of the u._s. too where they wanna get as much out of us as they possibly can and 

121.64 122.21 B: (( [mn] )) 

123.38 131.61 A: and you know give us little in return if we need anything that would really help us financially or whatever way 

126.14 129.45 B: (( mhm )) 

131.76 134.04 A: they're not there to help us in return 

134.42 136.70 B: (( right [noise] )) 

136.87 147.56 B: yeah i i don't know what's gonna happen there um yeah it's never been a stable situation i just i think it's unfortunately gotten more unstable the past couple of years um 

147.64 149.50 B: i don't know what um 

149.61 163.00 B: the whole iraqi situation is going to add to the mix i mean i guess it's better that we're in charge for now than ah saddam hussein but um i think that can cause more um resentment and terrorist attacks over here and ah 

163.23 166.63 B: [lipsmack] you know and who knows what else over there ah 

167.24 174.33 B: so i don't know and and you know if bush is as crazy as he is and you know he was talking about going into syria i think that's a mistake 

174.37 188.85 A: that's right you know it's all if he decides to go into syria where does that end and what other country's gonna be causing uprisings that that we will have to think or bush will think that we need to control and he'll keep going 

188.71 192.57 A: into one country after another without end is what i'm afraid of 

192.26 199.93 B: right and i and um part of the reason why [laughter] the palestinians hate the israelis is because they think they're in their land well you know what are we doing over there 

199.90 201.68 A: right 

201.83 206.25 A: yeah i guess that's that kinda would really sum it up too why 

206.27 216.40 A: we're kinda intruding in their form of government i mean there's a lot of people of iraqi people that don't didn't like saddam but then 

216.32 221.69 A: he had a lot of supporters too again that would fight for him 'til the dying end 

219.91 223.56 B: (( mhm )) 

222.14 226.84 A: and i it's just to me it's a no win situation 

226.88 241.46 B: right i mean i'm i'm a law student at the university of pennsylvania and ah michael moore was here speaking on campus last week and one of the things he pointed out was that you know here [lipsmack] when we got out independence back in the revolutionary war 

241.35 242.53 A: (( mhm )) 

241.41 244.45 B: we did that ourselves you know i mean it wouldn't have 

244.39 253.33 B: been the same he said if you know for example spain who hated the british came in and said okay well you know we don't like the british so we're gonna take them out and then give you 

253.24 263.15 B: a country to to run you know to have for yourself i mean we got our independence ourself you know it wasn't handed to us by by someone else and i don't know the ah 

263.30 268.98 B: i mean i'm sure the iraqi people are better off under this system than under saddam hussein but ah 

269.01 269.90 B: you know 

270.56 280.44 B: giving them um throwing out their dictator to bring in democracy i don't think it's gonna work democracy has to come in you know from the grass roots up you know start at the ground level and ah 

280.58 286.72 B: and rise up from the people it can't be ah forced upon people especially when they don't know what to do with it 

286.16 293.75 A: right right that's exactly what my thinking is too it's not something that they've really been asking for then they don't 

293.84 304.68 A: know how our system operates and it's gonna take a lot of time to indoctrinate them that they do realise what we're trying to do there and how we're trying to help them 

298.80 301.04 B: (( mhm )) 

304.09 304.76 B: (( mm )) 

304.78 306.81 B: but then again i don't know how 

306.90 314.79 B: compatible the the form of islam they practice i mean a lot of the people there practices with democracy you know when when you have rules about 

314.80 318.71 B: um a woman's place in society and and how 

318.73 323.42 B: she has to have her head covered and and the place of religion in society i mean it's 

323.43 325.53 B: it's a different ball game 

324.99 329.90 A: right entirely different than anything we're accustomed to 

330.07 335.94 B: right so you know i don't i don't know what's gonna what's gonna happen over there ah 

336.76 346.09 B: it's complicated it it'll it'll stay that way for a long time i guess i don't i don't see see an end but i i do know that ah if any any progress is gonna be made ah 

346.26 350.26 B: some regimes have to change over here and and over in israel you know mm 

350.43 351.35 A: right 

351.17 352.73 B: (( and the )) 

352.13 355.02 A: yeah and this so this doesn't leave an opening for 

355.08 366.11 A: ah bin laden to come in here and do all kind of terroristic acts maybe that he's been just waiting just for the right day and the right situation to pull off that we will be 

365.99 371.17 A: having our guard completely left down again because of all our soldiers many of our soldiers are 

371.30 374.81 A: in the far east right now and not here to help 

373.56 384.94 B: thing about that is is not not that not like we should be listening to bin laden or anything but i mean his whole point was that ah you know americans are taking over the world they're taking over the middle east they're 

384.92 390.54 B: you know they have their nose in in a bunch of other stuff and so what do we go do in response we stick our nose in more stuff 

390.39 391.66 A: right 

391.90 393.38 A: yeah that's 

394.01 397.00 A: that's gonna be lead to some 

397.86 401.21 A: far fetching troubles is my thinking right now of it 

401.48 407.39 B: (( right )) 

401.91 403.57 A: it'll be something that 

403.99 406.21 A: they'll wanna come back on us and 

406.93 409.13 A: on to everything that we're trying to do 

409.16 412.65 B: right i guess part part of my frustration i think is that ah 

413.30 417.51 B: yeah the country is asleep to some degree you know they're letting bush 

417.66 420.88 B: say what he wants to say do what he wants to do and ah 

420.99 425.76 B: you know there there's no end in sight i mean he still has a very high approval rating and ah 

425.77 429.59 B: you know it seems like the democrats are just folding their tents and they're 

429.48 443.96 B: gonna kinda let two thousand and four go by you know hope i mean i don't hope there's gonna be another another terrorist attack but i mean if it does i hope the timing of it is right it opens up enough people's eyes to ah make them think that we need a new direction in this country 

443.87 457.70 A: right but ah i think you know a lot of this is really it seems to be a personal battle of bush's because his father was kinda all done when what we what his his regime was trying to do 

453.04 453.60 B: (( mm )) 

457.72 459.01 A: (( and now it's taking )) 

457.77 458.33 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

458.67 460.78 B: (( i i agree i )) 

459.30 463.88 A: junior bush is trying to ah make up for what his father failed in and 

463.61 467.96 B: don't get me wrong because saddam hussein's not a good guy and you know i don't mind seeing ah 

468.60 472.32 B: you know his government taken by force but 

472.49 477.43 B: there's really no logical explanation as to why now is the time or the place he just kind of 

477.58 480.75 B: you know it's cowboy george trying to avenge ah 

480.85 483.65 B: you know his father's [laughter] presidency basically 

483.56 484.58 A: (( right [mn] )) 

486.65 488.05 B: but yeah i mean 

488.35 502.78 B: i i still don't understand the answer to the question why iraq why now you know i mean under afghanistan i can kind of understand although i mean though the problem with terrorism is that it's not run by government it's run by 

502.97 505.68 B: you know groups of terrorist cells you know we don't 

506.05 511.68 B: we don't bomb the united states because you have timothy mcveigh blowing up the oklahoma city 

511.67 524.83 B: federal building where he's an american but the united states government's not responsible for his actions [laughter] yeah if you're gonna go by the theory government should be bombing saudi arabia at this moment 'cause ah 

512.82 513.76 A: right 

513.89 514.75 A: (( right )) 

517.60 518.62 A: right 

524.64 527.33 B: a lot of the hijackers came from there so 

527.44 530.20 B: it's an interesting kind of war to fight but ah 

530.26 531.77 B: i don't think we're 

531.88 534.35 B: making any headway by going into um 

534.99 536.33 B: you know um 

536.44 540.05 B: ah iraq or and and certainly not syria 

540.88 549.61 A: and then what if we happen to go into syria then what might happen to ah north korea i mean are they gonna be next in line then and 

549.47 552.50 B: (( right )) 

549.83 551.31 A: you're gonna feel like 

552.90 553.77 A: you're 

554.00 561.71 A: feeling like we're gonna be intruding in their territory eventually and wanna take action against us and before that happens they want to be on the defensive 

560.02 569.01 B: right right yeah it's it's a difficult situation i don't know where it's going but ah 

570.00 572.24 B: [sigh] who knows 

573.12 575.16 A: i just hope it comes out 

575.71 587.23 A: fairly decent the end in the end not that we're much worse off than we've been before any of the terroristic action started here with nine eleven and everything since then 

585.01 586.09 B: (( right )) 

586.72 593.40 B: yeah one one of the things that that's a bit frustrating is that in i don't know how to address this but ah 

593.44 597.83 B: it seems all the action that's taken in response to nine eleven and everything it's always 

597.92 599.89 B: it's always um ret-
