0.52 1.59 A: (( hello )) 

1.61 2.84 B: hi 

3.02 4.76 A: hi my name's cathy 

5.03 8.87 B: hi my name is ankoor and i'm a student at penn state 

8.92 11.82 A: oh great yeah i'm in massachusetts i'm 

12.09 14.97 A: i'm older i'm not a student [laughter] 

13.88 15.83 B: [laughter] that's okay 

16.20 19.85 A: oh so what do you think about everything going on in the middle east 

20.34 27.12 B: um well i actually can give an international perspective you know i'm an international student from india and i'm doing my m._b._a. here 

26.84 27.67 A: (( ahah )) 

27.81 37.98 B: so the opinion i what i feel about the middle east is that it's probably a legacy of the past like what the british left behind and they probably left it for the u._s. to sort it out 

38.01 40.24 A: right that's probably true 

40.50 52.65 B: because the british just left in a haphazard way drawing arbitrary lines and i think it's just a question of you know being trying to incite religious sentiments because they want to get back at israel i don't think that's uh 

52.79 56.94 B: that's i don't think that's a valid reason for going after the israelis 

56.79 58.45 A: mhm right right 

57.79 61.28 B: uh because i think everybody's entitled to his or their homeland 

61.02 63.78 A: exactly yeah you're probably right yeah 

63.89 67.09 B: mhm oh what do you feel about it 

66.65 77.80 A: i've a i well i kind of feel the same way i feel like you know that i don't really think there will ever be peace in the middle east because like you said too many people are trying to 

77.83 81.60 A: butt in and change other people's ways 

81.39 82.31 B: mhm 

81.87 87.06 A: you know they a lot of people don't want to be bothered you know they want to stay with the way they are 

87.17 88.23 B: exactly 

87.74 90.62 A: you know so i don't think there's really ever going to be peace 

91.11 94.68 A: because you're always going to have people that want to step in and change it 

91.34 92.16 B: (( it's going )) 

94.74 107.52 B: yeah it's going to be tough i mean probably there can be peace but for that everybody the israelis as as well as the arab world they probably have to make so many concessions that which probably neither neither of the sides are willing to make 

107.20 108.12 A: (( right right )) 

109.00 116.60 B: we faced the same situation back home in india like we have fought three wars with pakistan over kashmir which is essentially the same issue of land 

117.08 129.96 B: and um i don't see any way that we can resolve it because there is too much ego at stake people don't look at the big picture they only look at you know like ego of nationalistic feelings like will we win the next election if we take this step 

129.38 133.14 A: mhm right right i think a lot of has to do with politics too 

132.73 135.83 B: it's it's too short sighted that's what i feel 

135.53 136.41 A: yeah 

140.50 142.42 B: and plus the u._s. has [mn] 

142.78 143.62 B: i mean 

143.48 156.05 B: being the only superpower left in the world you know it- it's difficult because they have to take that step because as you saw on september eleventh what happened this these things will keep on happening if the u._s. does not take a you know positive route 

151.17 152.13 A: (( right right )) 

155.91 162.92 B: i mean president bush i think has been unfairly criticized for having taken extreme measures as like going after iraq but 

162.83 172.69 B: i mean if you've got a choice between seeing your own countrymen die and seeing somebody else's countrymen die i think it preferable for the other people to die because you don't want your own country to be at danger all the time 

172.43 174.15 A: true true mm 

173.91 186.04 B: it's i see it as simple as that i mean i am from india i am i mean i don't i can't take sides i mean i'm here in the u._s. studying it's not that i'm saying this i'm pro u._s. just because i'm here but i think if i was 

187.06 189.25 B: india i would do the same 

189.29 193.40 B: thing i mean i would attack the other country having seen having seen my people die i 

193.44 196.37 B: mean what happened on september eleventh was huge 

196.05 198.39 A: right right right something had to be done 

198.44 200.05 B: yes something had to be done 

198.87 203.27 A: if you think something that you can just ignore and say well you know 

203.42 208.50 A: it happened and m- maybe something else is going to happen but we don't know and we're not going to do anything 

208.52 216.02 A: you know you have to do you have to do something and like you said you know president bush has been criticized but really what choice does he have 

215.74 219.83 B: he doesn't have many a lot of choice and that's what uh i think 

220.17 234.44 B: the americans i think the public the american public at least understands that i mean i just go by the support that he has by c._n._n. and all the gallup polls that they keep on doing so i that's kind of i think that should be heartening for them that at least the american public is supporting him 

234.32 235.89 A: right right 

236.21 236.99 A: yeah 

238.31 244.33 B: and the second issue is probably i think the bigger one was the oil that's there which is important for the world 

244.05 245.07 A: right 

245.07 255.67 B: and that's a very big issue and i wouldn't fault again i wouldn't fault president bush for going after the oil i mean it's it's a resource full of oil and somebody got to make use of it 

255.38 256.68 A: (( right right [laughter] it's )) 

256.43 258.53 B: [laughter] because people just 

257.07 258.37 A: (( there if you need it )) 

259.95 267.78 B: people just think that you know it's uh it's just economic and nothing else but it's gone far beyond economics now when you see so many people die 

267.45 269.13 A: mhm oh right right 

271.11 274.73 A: yeah i think we'll probably be over there for quite a long time just 

275.72 277.40 A: straightening everything out 

277.53 282.57 B: well i think they should be there for a longer time just so that this doesn't flare up again 

282.25 283.19 A: (( right right )) 

282.97 294.05 B: because as you are seeing in afghanistan the u._s. is not completely out of it but they are probably handing it over power a bit too early to the afghanis and problems and you know controlling their own people 

295.06 297.90 B: so probably the u._s. should should stay there 

298.24 303.15 B: (( in iraq a little longer and ensure ensure that elections are held )) 

299.56 300.63 A: yes i think 

305.12 306.40 A: (( so yeah yeah i agree )) 

307.48 316.00 A: i think i think they'll have to be over there quite a long time really at least you know some maybe not so many troops but some of them are going to have to stay there to 

310.71 311.31 B: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

316.47 318.91 A: wait until everything calms down and 

319.23 323.69 A: like you said get the elections going and everything straightened out 

324.57 330.39 B: yeah because you don't want to send your troops again to a place like iraq i don't i mean 

328.51 329.75 A: (( right [laughter] right yeah )) 

330.41 334.22 B: people have lost focus of the world just because they think that everything is 

334.82 336.65 B: all so hunky dory but i think 

337.23 339.74 B: there's still some grave danger to the troops out there 

346.99 348.26 A: (( [lipsmack] well i don't know [laughter] )) 

347.92 349.08 B: [laughter] 

348.46 351.70 A: what else is there to talk about on this subject you know [laughter] 

351.02 355.68 B: [laughter] yeah i mean that's what they want us to talk about just talk about the middle east 

353.49 354.51 A: (( i i know i oh )) 

358.26 363.62 A: i feel you know they did a good job going over there and doing what they did i think we did the right thing 

363.80 365.74 A: i don't think we really had any choice 

366.27 375.71 B: yeah and i think the key to the middle east i mean the pr- the peace or whatever president bush is striving for it probably lies in the hands of the israelis more than himself 

376.30 379.50 B: (( i mean it's probably going to take a lot of convincing on the part of )) 

379.55 380.11 B: (( uh )) 

380.12 389.68 B: you know like going after the israelis and making them make some huge concessions because they are the ones who really have to make the sacrifices if they want to see lasting peace 

389.35 390.30 A: (( mhm right )) 

390.48 395.78 B: i think that's why the contribution of president rabin would have been critical had he been alive today 

395.95 399.30 B: but unfortunately [laughter] that's the way things go 

398.93 399.99 A: (( mhm right )) 

400.76 404.37 B: it just takes a bullet to you know just delay the whole process 

408.53 412.95 B: i guess we have another two minutes to go [laughter] 

410.42 414.54 A: right yeah [laughter] oh [laughter] oh you were timing i didn't time it [laughter] i 

413.90 416.69 B: pardon me no i just i 

415.43 419.31 A: were you timing it i didn't i didn't look at the clock so i didn't know what time it was mm [mn] 

418.86 421.96 B: yeah i just saw the clock as when it started so 

424.28 433.01 A: no it's funny because ten minutes is like is like a long time [mn] after you finish what you want to say then it's like mhm [laughter] what else do we need to say [laughter] 

430.76 431.85 B: [laughter] 

433.33 438.53 B: [laughter] yeah i mean you it's it's probably saying the same things again and again 

438.07 439.25 A: right right 

438.58 439.92 B: and you know 

441.33 442.53 A: (( yeah well )) 

442.34 452.71 B: like but the thing is the middle east has changed i mean september the eleventh has changed a lot of things for so many people you know i have so many international like people from the suez and the middle east 

452.82 456.14 B: who are probably being treated unfairly but you know 

456.85 460.92 B: what happened was not normal and so the consequences of that are not going to be normal 

462.35 465.29 B: [mn] i have a friend who is from lebanon and uh 

465.33 471.05 B: he has had to like go for finger printing and he has to go to the f._b._i. probably every three months 

470.72 471.65 A: wow 

471.08 472.60 B: and so 

473.19 476.53 B: i mean there is some discrimination but again 

476.77 483.82 B: those people those nineteen people who committed those horrendous acts they weren't thinking of all the people that would be affected by it 

483.42 484.28 A: right 

484.57 485.91 B: and so you know i 

484.67 492.78 A: i know that's what's amazing is how many people in the united states were affected by that that you know had nothing to do with it and it affected their whole life 

492.95 495.68 B: it has it has i mean definitely it's due 

494.51 496.59 A: affected everybody's life i guess 

496.14 496.78 B: (( ha )) 

496.86 501.93 B: in some way or the other it has least of all the people who lost their near and dear ones 

501.45 502.29 A: (( yeah right )) 

502.04 515.20 B: i mean even business or politics or students i mean every walk of life has been affected in some way or the other i mean take a simple thing as us travelling you probably had gone for easter somewhere and you'd you'd think twice about i better 

507.54 508.41 A: yeah 

515.45 518.99 B: just drive you know it's much safer driving 

516.04 516.99 A: (( right right i )) 

519.05 520.11 A: (( know right exact- )) 

520.21 524.55 B: because you never know who the next maniac is going to be out there who is going to bomb the plane 

526.59 527.72 A: (( yeah that's true )) 

526.70 527.59 B: so 

528.17 536.98 B: things have been changed ir- irrevocably and it's going to be some time before things get back to pre september eleventh which i doubt they will ever get back to 

536.08 547.94 A: yeah yeah that's that's the sad part i don't think it will ever be back to the you know [mn] everybody will always have some fear of other people or like you said if you are flying not knowing if it's safe you know mhm mhm right right 

548.02 559.78 B: [sigh] i think that's taking a lot of uh toil on the psyche of the common man because you know i saw i was seeing these uh interviews on uh c._n._n. i think and they were just showing this uh 

559.78 568.89 B: crowd the workday crowd walking up to their offices and everybody was like i don't know what's in store for me because i never know if somebody is going to bomb my office today 

569.66 582.74 B: so that that that says quite a lot about the fear that people have nowadays i mean as simple as them going to do grocery shopping or you know going for a walk you don't know whether there is going to be a bullet whizzing by your ear [mn] 

584.45 594.52 B: there is such a sense of uh you know panic in the common man that something is going to give and things are not the way they were and and the world has become a lot more unsafe than it was 

594.80 599.89 A: right but it's almost like you just have to you know you can't worry about that you know if something's going to happen it's going to happen there's
