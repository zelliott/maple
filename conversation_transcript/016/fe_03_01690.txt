0.59 3.06 A: hi i'm marcia anderson 

2.83 5.29 B: hi i'm susan how you doing 

5.80 6.93 A: okay 

7.44 8.73 A: how about you 

8.47 9.79 B: good 

10.27 12.72 B: so how you feel about the middle east [laughter] 

13.46 15.36 A: i'm not sure 

14.93 16.46 B: [laughter] 

17.07 19.92 A: everyone around me seems to have different opinions 

19.97 21.15 B: oh yeah 

21.53 26.43 A: yeah i'm not sure if we could go to peace with iraq or anything 

26.06 27.23 B: mhm 

27.64 32.76 A: because it seems like they kinda need our help but 

33.87 35.09 A: then again 

35.54 37.68 A: they don't seem to want it much 

37.23 38.49 B: mhm 

39.90 44.63 A: and they accept the food that we give them and the things that we give them 

39.90 40.73 B: yeah 

44.71 49.17 A: and yet they never say thanks and they never give us any 

49.90 53.84 A: indication that they want it they just take it and run 

53.64 54.78 B: mhm 

56.34 57.46 A: (( what do you think )) 

57.10 71.24 B: um yeah i was actually thinking peace in the middle east the first thing that came to my mind was the israeli palestinian conflict but i guess iraq also falls in the middle east as well it's um well i think it's hard i think um 

71.86 73.41 B: you know you have to 

73.34 78.94 B: remember that the people were under a dictator so the information and news that they received was very limited 

78.87 90.70 B: so i'm sure anything they heard about the united states or america was probably very negative um and they think it's hard to fight a war for a group of people claiming that you're fighting for their independence and freedom 

90.90 92.01 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

93.17 98.36 B: when the people aren't necessarily the ones asking for that assistance so 

98.57 102.07 B: it can be very um problematic in that way 

102.29 112.83 B: [mn] 'cause obviously a democracy is founded because the people wanted a democracy but in this case a democracy was created because the united states wanted to create it not because the people 

113.20 115.30 B: themselves fought for it 

115.90 117.85 B: so i think that can be problematic 

119.54 123.93 A: yeah [laughter] probably a good thing 

125.32 128.88 A: i really don't know much on this subject i'm sorry 

128.25 135.07 B: no that's okay yeah i was thinking peace i mean i guess the war's almost over so i would hope it would be peaceful 

129.43 130.34 A: (( i'm just )) 

134.17 137.26 A: i know that is so cool i 

137.35 142.22 A: mean it doesn't even seem like much of a war we haven't fought like a ton of battles or anything 

141.41 142.97 B: yeah 

142.99 145.06 A: i don't get why we call it that 

146.00 147.55 B: a war yeah 

147.64 150.21 A: i know it doesn't even last that long 

150.93 158.12 B: yeah yeah i mean i was gonna say it is kind of weird considering [laughter] um it only lasted 

159.09 161.82 B: um a number of weeks and um 

162.38 167.12 B: we obviously out gunned them and out bombed them and had many more missiles 

166.63 168.95 A: of course we're wonderful 

168.75 170.15 B: [laughter] 

169.68 171.11 A: [laughter] 

173.49 175.36 B: so um 

175.06 177.36 A: what were the other questions 

177.15 190.64 B: um will peace ever be obtained in the middle east like i said i don't know i i was thinking it possibly the question when i heard that question i thought maybe it will be um it was referring to the palestinian israeli conflict that's what i thought it was referring to 

192.29 196.80 A: i'm not sure if it'll be a ever obtained you know because they're so 

196.83 204.48 A: different from each other you've got like so many different classes there and all of them are like suspicious of each other and going 

204.97 206.90 A: they don't like each other 

207.25 209.67 A: and they won't listen to each other 

209.65 210.73 B: mhm 

211.05 215.13 A: and just sit down and try to work out 

215.65 221.25 A: the things that they have in common instead of focusing on the worst things that are different 

224.39 235.27 B: mhm yeah i think they obviously different cultures it's a clash of civilizations two completely different kinds of cultures israel's like probably the 

235.42 237.23 B: one and only modern 

237.66 247.57 B: um democratic nation amongst um you know some very conservative muslim nations so it makes it the odd ball out so 

249.57 255.98 B: and of course a part of the tensions are that the palestinian people want their own state and their own homeland and they don't have it mhm mhm 

256.07 258.11 A: i know they're like 

258.40 270.42 A: a little while back how they were all fighting with the ah other people over that and how upset they were and then i found out something interesting 

270.52 274.38 A: um from a friend of mine who's a really cool history teacher 

274.75 277.60 A: apparently um 

278.83 285.69 A: the ah i think it was clinton but i'm not sure ah he was ah with the pa- palestinian leader 

285.72 288.63 A: and the leader of the dudes they were fighting against 

289.22 291.52 A: and apparently 

291.79 297.37 A: the people got the lea- palestinian leader got everything that he asked for 

297.38 299.14 A: and then he turned it down 

300.68 306.69 B: apparently he got a very good deal and he turned it down this was with clinton yeah this was a while ago 

307.62 315.53 B: i i don't remember if it was sharon or barak but yeah because um yeah [lipsmack] apparently he got a very good deal and um 

316.03 322.73 B: he turned it down because he knew the people would not support it and he knew he'd probably be assassinated i think that was part of the reason 

324.19 325.15 B: um 

324.24 326.29 A: you almost feel sorry for him 

327.65 332.93 A: i don't get why the people would refuse it they got all the stuff that they were protesting for 

327.70 328.53 B: (( mm )) 

333.20 338.72 A: like being their own state and having help from the government like billions of dollars 

339.38 340.79 A: and then they just 

341.06 342.81 A: refuse it 

343.85 346.49 A: and suddenly say that they don't want it 

346.56 353.24 B: [lipsmack] yeah i'm not really sure of the politics behind it but my guess would be that um um 

356.41 357.16 A: um 

357.35 361.19 B: i'm i'm not sure but i i think my guess would be that they just didn't want to 

361.26 362.40 B: deal with 

362.53 363.60 B: clinton 

363.86 371.76 B: and i don't know if it was sharon or barak but whoever it was back when you know the israeli prime minister or president back in the day they just didn't want to deal with him i'm not really sure 

372.11 373.19 B: um 

374.99 385.40 B: but i know they're angry for many a reason partly not having their own state and being held in refugee camps for a while 

385.49 390.78 A: i know that would seem so awful being stuck in a camp 

391.71 394.35 A: i i'm not much of an outdoors person 

394.61 397.45 A: i like the indoors thank you very much 

396.87 397.87 B: [laughter] 

398.14 406.98 B: yeah i don't know if it's outdoors as in roughing it or if it's just i think maybe like a settlement like an area i'm hoping they have [lipsmack] 

408.13 410.59 B: some kind of facility but 

413.27 417.93 A: so would i nothing like the japanese americans or 

418.24 421.17 A: african americans or anything like that 

421.24 423.28 A: i'm hoping they have a nice place 

424.74 425.87 B: (( um yeah mhm )) 

426.38 428.45 B: japanese americans have what 

428.68 431.11 A: oh like back in the ah 

431.60 436.28 A: world war two i think it was how the japanese americans got stuck in all these 

433.07 434.07 B: mhm 

436.41 437.77 A: camps 

437.46 439.20 B: oh yeah the internment camps 

438.28 439.74 A: (( and argh )) 

442.17 444.19 B: yeah they had everything taken away from them 

444.40 445.52 B: so 

448.64 449.66 B: (( hm )) 

449.78 452.59 A: think there's any other problems in the middle east 

453.47 454.65 B: um 

455.56 456.58 B: um 

457.71 462.60 B: i just think the biggest problem is a clash of ah the cultures clash of civilizations 

462.78 465.01 B: and ah we have to be careful 

466.32 469.02 B: not to impose our way on other people mhm 

466.51 467.83 A: yeah 

469.73 472.29 A: and not try to get too involved 

472.03 473.04 B: mhm 

472.40 475.46 A: just like help them a little bit when they need them 

475.40 487.84 A: when they need it but don't try to get too involved and don't try to help them too much because then they'll start relying on you and when you end up having to draw back 

488.15 491.62 A: due to probably politics or something like that 

491.93 495.26 A: then they'll get pretty upset 

496.10 498.08 A: so to watch that out 

497.95 499.01 B: mhm 

499.93 500.97 B: yeah that's 

501.02 502.79 B: that's probably 

504.14 505.46 B: (( good advice so i don't know what else to )) 

511.87 513.82 B: say on the topic peace 

513.19 518.47 A: neither do i i'm just kind of stuck here yeah okay sure [laughter] 

517.06 519.72 B: peace and middle east conflict 

520.41 523.45 B: yeah war bad peace good [laughter] 

523.97 526.57 A: (( yes i don't want to die )) 

526.83 528.07 A: mommy [laughter] 

527.78 529.16 B: (( [laughter] )) 

530.93 532.13 B: um 

532.45 533.48 A: um 

535.59 537.69 B: i think we have one minute left 

537.78 539.72 A: one minute you're timing it
