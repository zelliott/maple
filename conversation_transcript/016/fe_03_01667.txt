34.57 41.02 A: [mn] i don't know how i feel about going in i certainly feel bad about all our poor boys that have died

40.84 42.34 B: right yeah

48.04 51.57 A: (( ah [lipsmack] i i don't know this this one's tough ah )) 

50.48 56.18 B: yeah it is really tough i mean i i feel like i i really don't know e- enough about anything that goes on over there ah 

56.58 58.98 B: i just you know i mean 

59.02 69.11 B: i don't think i i don't think i read enough about it but um [mn] you know it just it's it's just such a different world and it's ah it's hard to know what ex- what exactly you can do you know 

69.04 70.01 A: (( i know )) 

69.38 71.59 B: an- and what's gonna happen ah 

71.71 77.00 B: you know i mean right now it seems like a big mess and um you know 

77.24 82.78 B: [mn] there's so many different ethnic groups and religious groups and i mean h- how do you ah 

82.83 86.25 B: set up a government now in this in this ah 

86.46 88.92 B: entering all this turmoil so [mn] 

88.53 89.51 A: i know 

89.55 96.32 A: i know i think that's why ah ah those nations always have such a hard time is because their beliefs are so different 

95.84 96.97 B: (( right [mn] )) 

96.38 97.77 A: and um 

98.54 102.23 A: this this i think this is why they're always fighting over there 

101.83 103.64 B: (( right mhm )) 

102.37 107.49 A: um i also agree i i pay some attention and i do some reading 

107.57 111.90 A: on it but um my husband probably knows a lot more than i do 

111.45 113.06 B: yeah [laughter] 

112.10 121.61 A: [laughter] yeah but um [lipsmack] i was against going in um i i wanted t- to wait for the u._n. to give the okay 

117.51 118.46 B: mhm 

121.16 122.44 B: right 

122.05 127.05 A: um i just think it would have been better to have everybody back us 

126.86 139.97 B: yeah i fe- i feel like it's sort of a it only solidifies the the rest of the world's feelings about us you know in in that we're sort of [noise] bullies and you know just going in and doing whatever we want anyway you know ah 

138.95 139.82 A: right 

139.94 144.70 B: just why did why even bother asking if you're gonna go do it anyway sort of thing 

144.42 150.07 A: ah i agree i agree and i certainly feel bad for all the families that have lost their 

145.08 146.72 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

150.90 153.66 A: their sons and daughters um 

152.41 153.40 B: mhm 

153.74 160.31 A: all the poor families that are doing without because their their husbands and wives are other there 

160.00 162.14 B: right yeah exactly 

161.79 166.76 A: yeah but and i feel bad for all the poor people over there that got killed 

166.42 167.42 B: right 

167.12 169.67 A: so many innocent people got hurt 

169.21 170.97 B: right yeah 

169.84 173.16 A: and i wish there was a better way we could have done this but 

172.32 174.89 B: yeah and i mean there's still a- 

175.45 177.78 B: an- and it doesn't seem like any- 

177.72 191.47 B: anything has really been accomplished i mean wh- what's re- you know they they really haven't like captured saddam for one i mean obviously it seems like his regime has been taken down but but there's no clear ah 

191.47 202.88 B: person or group that can step up and clearly take the place and and not be a dictator or um you know or or not be ah prejudiced against someone 

202.92 203.77 A: right 

203.02 211.05 B: so it's sort of it's sort of scary wha- what happens next and i mean all these people i was listening to the radio today and they said um 

210.95 215.55 B: you know things do seem to be getting back well not to normal but 

215.35 227.11 B: getting back to the way they were and people are lined up at gas stations and people are going to the market but but then still at night they all go inside and lock their doors because of all the looting that's still taking place 

227.08 232.72 A: right right yeah yeah i i [laughter] i know um 

227.20 228.39 B: so [mn] 

232.75 243.05 B: so i mean yeah i guess it definitely seems like somebody needs to stay there and sort of try and help sort things out but [mn] how how long can you stay you know [laughter] 

239.76 240.53 A: yes 

242.60 249.90 A: i well there the i i think they were when did they say like five years it's gonna take to rebuild 

247.43 248.86 B: oh jeez 

249.78 250.79 B: yeah 

250.14 252.82 A: and ah i think we need um 

253.24 256.03 A: they need to set up as soon as possible a 

256.05 266.92 A: form of government that can take over the you know the the police force and and ah you know start to get back you know their own lives and govern their own lives 

260.78 261.68 B: right 

264.81 265.73 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

267.08 268.85 A: um but um 

269.50 271.55 A: it's gonna take a long time 

271.42 282.14 B: yeah and it's hard 'cause i mean like we don't really understand their their traditions their culture you know so w- w- what what do they want you know [laughter] 

272.47 273.63 A: yeah 

281.64 282.78 A: yeah i know 

282.62 284.03 B: (( so yeah )) 

283.33 288.19 A: yeah um i think they plan on putting um [lipsmack] oh what's his name 

288.77 292.70 A: ah the one that that was exiled to england 

292.66 295.59 B: oh i can't remember his name i know who you're talking about 

292.74 293.61 A: um 

293.95 301.42 A: yeah they're gonna put him they're gonna i think they were gonna put him in and he's gonna do basically what the u._s. want him to do 

300.97 302.42 B: yeah 

301.97 308.75 A: and that hope- hopefully that'll work for a while until these people can understand what democracy's all about 'cause 

308.01 309.33 B: yeah 

308.76 310.26 A: they don't even have a clue 

310.07 313.08 B: right i mean how could they yeah 

311.59 312.46 A: yeah 

312.49 316.17 A: yeah and hopefully he's been in england long enough to um 

317.08 321.44 A: to realize he's got to treat these people right he's got to be fair 

319.57 320.47 B: right 

321.53 326.45 B: [mn] yeah we can we can hope i mean [lipsmack] i don't know it just seems like 

326.48 331.17 B: oh can you just keep going in and and taking out all these you know 

331.28 334.50 B: all these ah people you don't like you know and 

334.11 338.13 A: i know an- and that doesn't work because we don't even know if any of 'em are dead 

337.67 338.78 B: right 

338.28 349.96 A: bin laden's still alive ah the atti- ayatollah you know we never got at him [laughter] so i do- i don't know and like ah saddam who knows 

339.87 341.49 B: oh yeah yeah 

343.70 345.21 B: (( right yeah )) 

349.53 350.86 B: right 

349.96 354.09 A: you know he's got so many look-alikes who knows if he's alive [laughter] 

351.81 354.51 B: i know that's [laughter] that's the thing 

354.48 355.37 A: yeah 

355.03 359.55 B: i love that a- a- all these people have had plastic surgery so they can look like him 

359.35 362.59 A: i know they gotta be desperate yeah 

359.95 363.06 B: i think that's crazy that's crazy 

363.14 376.06 B: i mean [lipsmack] i don't know and y- you hear so many conflicting things like i mean you h- you see things on the news where all the people are rejoicing and saying we love bush and then and then other people say well we don't we didn't want you here in the first place and 

375.25 381.36 A: yeah i think they say we love bush only because um [mn] the marines are handing out ah 

381.35 391.34 A: pictures of bush and everything you know a- and i think they're just saying that for now i don't think any of 'em mean it [laughter] y- yeah and they're just happy to get rid of saddam 

382.54 383.63 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

387.12 389.18 B: no no [laughter] 

390.91 393.77 B: yeah that's exactly it yeah [mn] 

392.31 393.73 A: (( yeah but )) 

394.47 396.62 A: ah [lipsmack] i d- i i don't know ah 

397.17 406.64 A: they they seem to prey on their own you know with all the looters and everything you just don't know like you say you don't know how they think for their cultures are way way different 

401.05 402.11 B: yeah 

403.83 404.80 B: yeah 

406.69 410.00 B: and i g- i guess as a soldier you just have to really you know 

410.23 417.34 B: believe that you're you're helping you know and y- you could possibly die but it's gonna help these people you know and [mn] 

417.49 424.67 B: i can't im- i can't imagine being in the military and ah going over there and not you know believing it so [laughter] [mn] 

417.63 418.45 A: but they 

424.11 426.31 A: i know i know and i think they do 

426.23 428.65 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

426.62 427.77 A: (( i think they do )) 

427.81 428.97 A: (( ah yeah um )) 

430.47 431.83 A: i hope they do [laughter] yeah 

431.39 432.76 B: (( i know [mn] [mn] )) 

435.40 436.96 A: (( so oh i don't know i don't know )) 

437.74 439.04 A: it's a tough one 

437.81 438.65 B: so 

438.67 445.00 B: yeah yeah [mn] and then i mean [mn] well i i love what happened when ah you know when 

444.99 456.98 B: when [mn] you know france and germany and the other countries wouldn't you know wouldn't back it right away um [mn] then all of a sudden they're our enemies too you know [laughter] and so [mn] i think that's pretty ridiculous but 

456.38 460.98 A: yeah i think they were saying not too long ago on the news that france is really trying 

461.07 462.84 A: now to be our buddies 

462.38 463.60 B: right 

462.90 467.60 A: they're they're going overboard to be nice ah but um 

464.01 464.78 B: [mn] 

465.19 466.71 B: mhm 

468.13 470.35 A: i don't think they've ever liked the americans 

470.10 477.07 B: [mn] yeah well that's not true [laughter] 'cause i mean i lived there for a little while and i was ah you know i was ah 

472.58 473.40 A: no 

477.56 484.07 B: pretty famous in the town i was in because i was the one american and they loved me so [mn] yeah 

482.34 483.37 A: oh 

483.47 485.07 A: well that's good to know 

484.60 486.45 B: yeah i mean i think that 

486.48 494.64 B: that that's one of the problems is that you know you have these stereotypes of all these different countries and [mn] so immediately when somebody y- you know says 

494.77 498.18 B: no to the u._s. they're gonna all of a sudden 

498.46 508.43 B: ah i mean i think it's definitely true that they still want to be you know a world power and they aren't but [mn] an- and pretty much nobody is but ah except for us i guess [laughter] 

506.40 507.27 A: right 

507.94 509.60 A: [laughter] 

508.77 509.73 B: um 

509.81 516.65 B: so it's it's kinda hard i guess to stand up to the u._s. and then yeah and then after after all this happens what can you do so [mn] [lipsmack] 

516.13 519.99 A: yeah right and england they're pretty strong too in um 

519.49 520.60 B: yeah 

520.03 525.42 A: yeah so you know they've got us and england so um 

521.17 521.87 B: [mn] 

523.18 524.19 B: yeah 

524.70 528.55 B: i mean i can i can understand not wanting to send in any of your ah 

528.72 536.98 B: your people to fight you know and [laughter] possibly get killed if everyone's not behind it and i mean [mn] you know everyone was not behind it here so 

530.40 532.05 A: (( right right )) 

536.30 537.48 A: (( no no )) 

537.07 539.30 B: it's very very divided so 

539.12 546.57 A: right yeah um i i don't yeah i i wasn't for it but um 

539.97 540.61 B: (( [mn] )) 

546.75 549.59 A: [lipsmack] i don't know any other way they could have done it 

549.21 550.36 B: yeah 

549.81 554.87 A: ah if they wanted for the u._n. wh- who knows how long they would've taken 

553.51 556.28 B: right how right exactly 

555.73 556.69 A: um 

556.47 557.29 B: [mn] 

556.94 558.94 A: there's no good answer on that one 

558.62 559.86 B: (( no [mn] )) 

559.59 560.69 A: (( no not really )) 

560.81 567.34 B: and so i mean yeah so any of these soldiers who have gone over there will they be there for a long time or [mn] 

567.73 568.94 A: (( ah )) 

569.18 571.42 A: i think that ah 

571.65 578.06 A: [mn] they- they'll probably you know do tours of so long i would think how else could you do it 

575.11 576.16 B: right 

577.41 582.58 B: yeah i can't im- i can't imagine yeah they could- they couldn't stay there for for years [laughter] 

579.65 580.74 A: (( ah yeah )) 

582.09 593.06 A: yeah yeah i think i think it's like [mn] um i know when my brother was in the army he did a three year tour over in germany but i don't think they i i think that's way too long 

586.91 587.90 B: mhm 

593.06 595.11 B: yeah that would be [laughter] 

593.46 594.33 A: (( um )) 

594.92 599.95 A: [lipsmack] yeah i think i think you know um it would be nice if they could do like six months you know it
