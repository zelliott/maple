22.22 23.34 B: well 

23.69 25.35 B: i was all for it 

25.28 28.71 A: yeah was until

31.07 32.16 B: yeah 

32.05 34.61 A: um do you know anybody who's over there 

35.15 36.09 B: no 

35.72 36.61 A: (( no )) 

36.74 42.16 A: i don't either um but you know you hear about people all the time we've had a couple of people in our 

42.23 44.94 A: area that have died fighting 

45.66 47.35 A: and it's pretty sad 

47.50 48.69 B: yeah 

48.14 51.04 A: um do you think that they can ever 

51.27 53.60 A: solve all the problems and bring peace back 

54.95 55.97 B: (( ah )) 

56.25 57.62 B: now that i 

57.88 63.31 B: hear about what's going on i don't think they'll ever have a a 

64.44 67.93 B: the kind of government we think they should you know 

67.22 70.17 A: like a democratic like we have 

69.80 72.56 B: because they live in kind of tribes 

73.10 76.31 A: yeah yeah that's true 

76.89 80.44 A: and it's it's almost like they they don't know how to 

80.68 82.02 A: have freedom 

83.19 84.30 B: yeah 

83.68 87.81 A: like when with all the looting and everything that's been going on the 

88.22 93.18 A: you know their religious beliefs you know don't comply with that but 

93.76 96.33 A: you know they're still doing it 'cause they can 

96.52 97.44 A: (( like ah )) 

98.07 106.24 A: its all their leaders ah you know the religious leaders are calling for them to stop and behave and they just don't really know 

106.28 108.44 A: how to govern themselves 

108.72 110.58 B: yeah 

110.05 113.03 A: but do you think we should stay over there for a while 

113.83 119.08 B: well i heard that we might be getting some ah having bases over there 

118.59 120.21 A: oh really 

119.83 122.26 B: yeah but i think ah 

122.89 125.10 B: in three of the big towns 

124.75 126.42 A: oh 

125.92 128.82 B: one up north one in 

129.30 132.52 B: his home town and then another one 

132.84 133.66 A: (( ha )) 

133.52 135.79 B: and if they do that 

136.39 138.37 B: that's good i think 

138.15 139.30 A: yeah 

138.91 140.33 B: that would help 

141.00 147.55 B: but i'm i'm afraid that if we stay too long we might get into it with syria or 

147.33 155.68 A: yeah yeah and and kuwait and all those places that we have already had problems with 

149.44 150.01 B: (( [mn] )) 

156.10 165.34 A: i just um and people over there seem to hate us i mean they they like what we've done for them but they want us to get out 

165.73 171.30 A: and they you know expressed concern that they don't want us to control their government 

172.03 174.48 A: so i don't know how that would 

174.52 179.95 B: well would not i don't think we're supposed to control it we're just supposed to help set it up 

174.69 175.43 A: (( hap- )) 

179.49 185.36 A: yeah but if we have a a presence there forever 

185.72 196.11 A: i don't know i i guess it's kind of scary just that such a that we're walking on thin ice with the people because they want us we want them to respect us in other words we're there to help them but it 

196.29 198.40 A: (( seems like we are kind of suspicious )) 

196.47 199.78 B: but if if we just up and left 

199.41 202.23 A: yeah 

199.87 202.58 B: i think a lot of people there would die 

202.26 203.90 A: i probably 

203.57 206.49 B: so we have to stay long enough to 

206.52 207.60 B: um 

208.48 211.95 B: you know make sure the people aren't gonna die when we pull out 

210.92 216.74 A: [laughter] yeah make sure everything is somewhat solid 

212.52 213.18 B: (( [laughter] )) 

216.34 221.78 B: their hospitals are up and running and and they you know 

219.24 221.68 A: yeah 

222.66 224.90 B: do they grow food at all there 

224.79 226.35 A: you know i don't know 

225.97 227.22 B: [laughter] 

226.77 233.75 A: or if is it i know they have that that oil for food program to the i think it's the u._n. that set it up that 

233.83 235.87 A: you know they sell their oil for 

236.43 237.77 A: for you know 

237.95 245.48 A: produce and all that kind of stuff but i don't know if they have any that they can rely on without that 

246.20 247.24 A: (( i don't know )) 

247.49 250.62 A: i can't imagine it being a very fertile area 

250.29 251.09 B: [laughter] 

252.44 256.81 A: morally just and they they rely so heavily on outside 

257.12 258.41 A: sources 

258.44 271.21 B: well i think baghdad is like a oasis but they they've got so many homes there you know in the town and all that then they have used up all of it you know 

262.79 264.02 A: oh really 

266.90 270.05 A: yeah 

270.86 274.94 A: right they've any of the fertile land they might have is 

274.95 276.20 A: covered up 

276.36 277.53 B: yeah 

277.28 279.56 A: (( i don't know i don't know )) 

279.66 281.06 A: i hope that ah 

281.73 287.60 A: that something happens quickly i and i haven't i haven't seen on the news lately if they have gotten 

288.00 292.31 A: the looting and everything under control but have you heard anything 

292.42 295.66 B: well i heard that there's still a little bit going on 

295.10 296.23 A: is there 

296.64 299.54 A: a little bit of unrest 

296.65 297.58 B: but 

298.07 298.96 B: but 

299.50 303.57 B: i think the marines pulled out and now it's just the army 

301.84 302.96 A: oh did they 

303.43 304.80 A: oh okay 

305.32 310.30 A: i don't know it it seemed to go a lot faster a lot more simple than i expected 

310.22 311.77 B: yeah me too 

311.66 318.01 A: it's it's almost like it's been too easy i just i'm waiting for something real catastrophic to happen 

318.37 321.02 B: yeah i'm the same way i'm like [mn] 

321.47 323.52 B: something's gonna happen [laughter] 

322.70 325.26 A: a little apprehensive about it 

324.81 333.15 B: they're gonna find the the chemicals and it's gonna be too late and somebody's gonna spill 'em and 

327.56 329.66 A: yeah 

332.42 338.55 A: yeah or saddam is out there somewhere with his finger on a button somewhere waiting 

338.45 339.87 B: yeah you're quite 

339.13 340.72 A: what for i don't know 

340.60 342.81 B: blow up the whole country 

342.18 345.75 A: [laughter] he probably would including himself 

345.98 348.40 A: as long as it made him look good 

348.25 350.74 B: i kind of think he's gone 

350.11 351.08 A: (( do you )) 

350.92 352.04 B: yeah 

352.07 353.32 A: i don't know 

354.03 360.21 A: 'cause they haven't they don't have any evidence of that but they don't have any evidence that he's alive either 

360.89 362.23 A: so i don't know 

360.97 362.07 B: yeah 

362.76 365.67 A: i kind of i kind of like the hard evidence 

365.38 369.26 B: i think all the pictures you seen of him were 

369.71 370.60 B: were 

371.21 374.00 B: it either wasn't him or it was 

374.25 375.08 B: (( ah [mn] )) 

376.12 380.45 A: yeah yeah things that the misidentification 

380.70 384.64 B: and last time he was in the news a lot 

384.96 386.56 A: yeah 

385.84 388.17 B: and this time he just wasn't 

387.93 389.25 A: that's true 

389.28 390.70 A: that's very true 

391.42 401.29 A: i don't know and they seem to have gotten a lot of his his supporters and and his sons and a lot of those people have been killed 

401.41 403.49 A: a lot of his you know his cabinet 

403.70 404.84 B: yeah 

405.27 407.59 A: so it could very well be 

405.91 408.61 B: but they might have got him the first time 

408.67 412.27 A: that's tr- but haven't didn't they have video of him 

412.49 413.75 A: since then 

413.81 416.00 B: yeah but he's got a lot of doubles 

415.71 417.21 A: oh that's true 

417.71 421.37 A: that's true i heard an interview on m._t._r. with a guy who was a double 

421.52 424.38 A: for him but it's not he doesn't live in 

424.62 426.83 A: iraq he lives here he just does it for 

427.07 434.08 A: actually he has done it for saddam but he was pretty funny he usually he now he does it for 

434.25 436.29 A: entertainment purposes 

436.28 439.19 B: but those people over there they could 

439.66 440.60 B: (( ah )) 

441.33 447.64 B: have a a good government because the ones that are living in this country are living under our government 

447.02 449.39 A: yeah they have a good example 

449.25 451.74 B: but there's just 

452.03 455.91 B: they're they didn't start this government either you know [laughter] 

454.44 455.38 A: no 

455.49 457.10 A: (( no this is true )) 

457.14 460.33 A: and i don- the culture is so different 

460.51 462.85 A: it's so different the way they view 

463.88 470.00 A: um every- and the way they view the the roles of men and women and and education and and 

470.03 473.80 A: all those things are so so different i don't know 

474.62 478.17 A: if they could make a democratic government work because you know 

478.49 481.47 A: for however many years it's been of 

482.21 483.56 A: dictatorship 

483.91 486.45 B: how many calls have you got on this study 

486.12 487.89 A: um just this one 

487.96 490.31 B: oh this is my fourth one 

489.87 493.18 A: is it so you've been getting paid for it 

493.59 497.66 B: well i was in the one before but my cheque ain't come from it yet 

498.37 503.13 B: but i know that a lot of other people got paid so i'm not worried 

501.31 502.52 A: oh okay 

502.72 505.97 A: well yeah i just barely found out about it 

505.94 508.52 B: and they had a lot of glitches in the other one 

508.45 509.57 A: oh did they 

509.78 511.85 B: and they fixed 'em all so 

511.53 513.49 A: oh good

520.08 523.35 B: [laughter] i don't know if i am going to get paid for this one 

523.33 527.13 A: oh yeah or maybe the one with glitches they weren't counting 

527.43 529.03 A: but that's odd they didn't 

529.69 531.59 A: communicate anything with you 

531.54 533.64 B: well it said you could ah 

534.42 538.05 B: you could get three and they could call you back up to twenty
