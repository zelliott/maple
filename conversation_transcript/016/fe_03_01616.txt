14.94 16.70 A: well 

15.40 17.20 B: have you done any of these before 

16.86 18.34 A: no i haven't have you 

17.90 19.28 B: no [laughter] 

18.87 20.44 A: it's my first one 

20.84 22.51 B: it seems pretty straightforward 

22.33 24.47 A: yeah 

23.94 26.04 B: (( [laughter] we got a hard topic though )) 

25.89 30.90 A: yeah what do you know what it's a very conflicting topic for people you 

26.65 27.98 B: [laughter] 

30.66 31.80 B: mhm 

31.65 32.67 A: (( know )) 

32.94 34.59 A: a lot of people are 

35.11 37.28 A: not happy with us being over there 

37.03 38.23 B: mhm 

38.50 41.57 A: you know i have a problem with americans 

41.60 43.72 A: being for or against it 

44.27 49.96 A: but i don't know i think we should chop away france for their disagreements with us [laughter] 

49.73 51.43 B: oh what do you think we can do 

52.49 53.73 A: (( huh )) 

53.49 56.28 B: what do you think we could do with them 

55.92 58.35 A: (( france ah )) 

60.03 67.20 A: i don't really don't know um because not not buy their products that's that's the big thing 

66.83 68.13 B: mhm 

67.58 71.79 A: and that's why they're pretty much being quiet now because americans were 

72.01 74.22 A: not buying their products so 

74.26 75.66 A: they lose money 

74.38 75.21 B: mhm 

76.50 81.91 A: there's not a lot you can do with france though it's not like a small country where you supply so much aid 

81.83 82.98 B: mhm 

82.91 83.85 A: (( you know )) 

85.75 89.00 B: yeah i think it's ah i think it's ah 

89.85 92.22 B: too bad that um 

92.54 94.64 B: that a lot of these european countries 

94.93 96.30 B: seems like they're 

96.42 101.40 B: their judgment is clouded by personal feelings of 

102.10 111.45 B: feeling um inadequate because the united states has a aggressive foreign policy and it makes them it makes them feel 

111.76 118.49 B: sensitive that they're not as strong i think i mean i think that's what's most of it stems from most of their opposition and 

118.13 119.82 A: yeah i think so too 

121.21 127.02 B: i think it's it's hard for them i mean obviously we have some sort of interest in 

127.42 129.49 B: trying to protect ourselves 

130.05 137.35 B: um by going into iraq and it's obvious that our main interests isn't just 'cause we want to save people 

137.68 140.07 B: but i think that 

140.10 145.12 B: that ah anybody who's looking at it objectively would have to agree that it will be 

145.41 150.37 B: for the better of the iraqi people in the long run i think 

151.28 152.73 A: i think so too 

153.30 158.09 A: i think it's amazing to see iraqi people just even demonstrating on television 

158.36 159.55 B: mhm 

159.01 162.16 A: you don't see that on any you know 

163.59 165.05 A: in in 

165.22 169.25 A: in iraq in syria in none of the places do you see people demonstrating 

169.28 170.29 B: mhm 

169.65 174.29 A: they'd be shot and i think that's i think that right there is 

174.78 179.23 A: justifies what you know us being there and taking over like that 

178.76 179.96 B: mhm 

179.41 184.54 A: you know i just think that justifies it because i think everybody has the right to to protest 

184.24 185.49 B: mhm 

185.46 186.46 A: (( you know )) 

187.20 192.63 A: so i i think that i think that's good um i hope we don't stay there much longer 

192.46 193.37 B: mhm 

192.71 195.77 A: i hope they set up a government and we get out of there 

196.39 203.27 A: 'cause i do believe that the longer we're there the longer the other arab nations won't tolerate us 

203.04 204.37 B: mhm 

204.11 208.50 A: which could cause a a lot of trouble for us i think 

207.86 209.17 B: (( mhm [laughter] mhm )) 

210.17 212.25 B: yeah i'm sure that there's a lot of 

212.27 216.64 B: [cough] i'm sure there's a lot of politicians and clerics in iraq that are 

217.17 219.67 B: hoping to get hoping to like 

217.92 218.52 A: [mn] 

220.05 228.98 B: um ride a popular wave of anti americanism to to power and hopefully if we get out of there quick enough then that won't happen 

224.60 225.38 A: [mn] 

228.73 229.99 A: exactly 

231.14 236.43 B: i'm sure they're all ready like a lot of 'em are just they're already giving ah 

236.59 238.66 B: giving sermons about 

238.70 240.82 B: trying to rile people up 

241.93 243.93 A: yeah 

245.65 249.19 A: i don't like the what goes on with the soldiers i mean i 

249.55 252.84 A: you know i hate the suicide bombers and 

253.62 255.95 A: they think they're brave i think they're 

256.07 257.72 A: cowards you know 

257.48 259.10 B: mhm 

259.58 264.30 A: they don't have enough nerve to face our our boys one on one on one with guns 

265.21 269.76 A: they are going to try ways to trick 'em and i just 

265.29 266.23 B: mhm 

270.62 273.05 A: i have two brothers who are over there right now 

273.19 274.50 B: oh they're still there 

274.57 276.28 A: yeah 

276.46 279.01 A: they're over there right yeah they're over there now 

279.10 281.31 B: how long were had they have been there 

280.30 283.42 A: one's in the marines one's in the air force 

283.68 284.74 A: um 

284.83 291.34 A: well the marine has been out there since oh my gosh like three weeks before it started 

290.69 291.78 B: mhm 

291.87 296.05 A: and my brother in the air force about three or four days before it started 

296.02 297.21 B: mhm 

297.03 299.25 A: yeah he's a flier so 

302.70 306.71 B: how much longer could it be that they have to stay mhm 

306.75 309.05 A: um i don't know i 

309.64 315.46 A: think my brother in the air force will be coming home sooner than the one in the marines the one in the marines he just 

315.53 318.28 A: they dismantle landmines and stuff so 

319.07 324.94 A: and stuff like that and clear the area of of dangerous 

321.03 322.14 B: mhm 

325.04 329.66 A: materials and stuff like that so i think they'll be there a while 

330.59 331.60 A: so 

333.43 335.10 A: and then i don't know i i 

335.85 339.37 A: have a feeling that this isn't quite all 

340.55 344.32 A: i don't i don't i don't think they're they're quite done i got you know 

344.63 350.89 A: unless syria starts listening to us ah we may be going into their back door now 

351.37 352.61 B: mhm 

352.08 355.02 A: i just kind of have that feeling [laughter] 

355.18 358.10 B: yeah yeah i heard them talking about that 

357.88 359.89 A: yeah 

360.41 361.39 B: (( so that )) 

360.46 363.44 A: so maybe that's why they haven't declared victory yet 

363.87 365.77 B: what kind of government do they have 

365.60 368.28 A: syria um 

366.24 367.25 B: mhm 

368.72 370.00 A: their their 

370.15 371.86 A: (( president )) 

372.23 381.41 A: he just it's hard to it's kind of it's a dictatorship his father was horrible the one in charge now they really don't know a lot about him 

378.01 378.95 B: mhm 

381.49 382.65 B: mhm 

382.51 383.85 A: (( you know he's )) 

384.57 386.20 A: he was you know 

386.73 392.08 A: pretty close with iraq and the other na- arab nations but also 

392.78 397.91 A: had a lot of ties with our government and the french government too 

397.86 398.96 B: mhm 

398.35 401.21 A: and russia and everybody [laughter] 

400.57 401.49 B: (( [laughter] )) 

401.31 404.05 A: so it's really hard to tell you know 

404.31 406.07 A: where their loyalties lie 

406.14 407.68 B: mhm 

408.26 409.25 A: so 

409.49 412.50 A: i think they're defiant against us anyway in 

413.82 417.52 A: th- you see even with the iraqi people i know they're glad that 

418.95 424.89 A: you know we got rid of saddam hussein for 'em but they don't want us there you can see that 

424.21 425.62 B: mhm 

426.48 428.10 B: they'd feel better 

427.95 429.82 A: yeah 

433.03 434.19 B: what about ah 

435.16 436.66 B: what about afghanistan 

439.54 441.21 B: i heard that it's getting 

441.36 443.48 B: it's still like pretty dangerous 

443.37 447.83 A: yeah i saw that last on last night on fox news 

448.62 450.85 A: that some of the 

451.01 456.18 A: like suicide bombers are are trying to attack soldiers there and 

456.29 458.20 A: but maybe that's 

458.34 461.99 A: just remnants of what's been going on in iraq 

461.68 463.48 B: mhm 

462.58 467.08 A: yeah i think for the most part afghanistan 

468.97 472.37 A: i think the afghan- afghanistan people are much more happy 

473.04 476.23 A: with what the change in their government and stuff 

476.43 477.51 B: mhm 

476.89 477.74 A: than 

478.06 480.28 A: what's going on with iraq right now 

481.53 483.26 A: i don't know if they really have 

484.78 486.52 A: any particular 

486.78 489.45 A: group of people that 

490.76 493.02 A: really want to run iraq [laughter] 

492.91 494.71 B: mhm 

494.72 497.68 A: a lot of them want to but i don't know if they 

498.86 502.95 A: if much of 'em know what it's like especially to have a democratic society 

502.91 504.08 B: right 

503.77 507.19 A: yeah i think that's the big i- the big thing there 

508.05 509.75 B: but at least they have 

510.56 511.76 B: a lot of 

512.63 515.06 B: ah cities people live in cities 

515.53 517.27 A: yeah 

515.66 520.44 B: and they're used to that and and they're not as poor as afghanistan 

521.48 523.79 B: or as totally destroyed 

524.12 525.99 A: yeah 

527.49 533.40 A: yeah but they they're not quite they're not as as poor as afghanistan 

534.61 542.21 A: i think that um iraq if they do build a democratic society it will be a very rich country with all the oil 

542.00 542.90 B: (( mm )) 

542.66 550.34 A: you know if if the money that the country makes i mean actually benefits the people there it will be a very rich country 

550.06 551.40 B: mhm 

552.51 553.55 A: so 

552.65 555.04 B: it definitely has a lot of potential 

555.62 557.62 A: yeah it does i just hope we're 

557.79 559.82 A: careful about who we put in 

560.03 561.57 A: in charge there 

561.27 562.50 B: mhm 

561.94 562.86 A: (( you know )) 

563.93 569.97 A: because i mean hussein was there because we put made the blessing of him being there when he first took over too 

570.14 571.04 B: right 

570.77 575.18 A: (( you know back you know if we had only known [laughter] )) 

574.43 575.82 B: mhm 

575.98 576.99 A: so 

576.62 579.09 B: it seemed like a good idea at the time 

578.42 579.95 A: exactly 

583.73 587.23 A: ah i guess there's a lot over there to control 

587.66 593.09 A: a lot of billions and billions of dollars coming in for the oil you know 

593.64 595.41 B: mhm 

594.42 598.60 A: these people become greedy they have a lot of ulterior motives 

599.01 599.89 B: mhm
