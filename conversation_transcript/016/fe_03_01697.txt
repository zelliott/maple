0.40 1.52 A: hello 

1.24 2.31 B: hello 

2.35 3.57 A: hi how are you 

3.53 4.76 B: good how are you 

4.42 6.08 A: just fine where are you from 

6.01 7.89 B: i'm from bookham washington 

7.72 11.16 A: oh really oh i have a sister that's visiting me here from walla walla 

11.25 13.22 B: cool so somewhat close 

12.80 14.54 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

13.75 14.86 B: (( where are you from )) 

14.83 17.48 A: um i'm in uh chicago suburbs 

17.42 18.30 B: okay 

18.06 21.12 A: yeah but i've been out there i've been into bookham so 

18.97 19.85 B: (( cool oh )) 

20.83 21.77 B: okay 

21.41 24.61 A: yeah yeah so what do you think about what's going on mhm 

22.97 23.63 B: (( oh )) 

25.05 26.57 B: um [noise] 

26.95 29.30 B: i agree that they need peace 

29.48 30.45 A: [laughter] 

30.39 34.70 B: but being college student we've kind of talked about this in some classes 

34.79 38.45 B: and their lifestyles in the middle east are different 

39.08 44.15 B: than what we have in america and they kind of have like different traditions and values 

40.77 41.59 A: true 

44.70 55.97 B: and one of the reasons we think there's so much conflict is because americans are going there with their traditions and values that we have and not understanding they have different values 

56.08 58.46 B: mainly like on the religious level 

58.82 59.75 A: mhm 

58.98 60.42 B: if that makes any sense 

60.49 65.34 A: well yeah i i think yeah i i think probably even the government leaders 

65.50 69.79 A: you know i- it's pretty obvious they have different traditions and values that that's really true 

68.40 69.27 B: mhm 

70.60 73.76 B: so and i don't that either side really understands 

74.12 78.95 B: what values the other one has and i think that's creating some conflict because 

78.38 79.27 A: right 

79.34 83.51 B: it's more kinda i think the middle east are like why are you here 

83.73 90.50 B: to the americans and not l- like i think there's a communication barrier that's causing a lot of problems 

91.38 93.45 A: yeah i'm sure it would have to 

93.46 94.23 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

94.15 96.17 A: yeah they probably 

96.55 100.53 A: well they've lived under tyranny for so long over there that 

100.10 101.14 B: mhm 

100.71 104.19 A: you know they're used to perhaps more violence than 

104.42 109.49 A: we prefer to put up with [laughter] you know nine eleven being the major 

109.56 115.78 A: um example [laughter] you know we're we don't want that to happen to us and [sigh] 

111.65 112.63 B: (( correct )) 

116.74 117.56 A: you know 

117.80 121.40 A: i guess supposedly that was the reason we went over there was because 

122.31 124.53 A: of [sigh] potential 

124.55 127.17 A: problems that could come to us 

127.04 127.95 B: mhm 

127.19 128.81 A: as a result you know 

129.88 130.73 A: so 

131.12 137.91 A: [laughter] it it it certainly was a strange feeling to have the americans be the aggressors this time 

137.22 138.19 B: yeah 

137.97 139.09 A: you know i 

138.24 140.56 B: 'cause that's normally not the case [laughter] mhm 

140.21 145.44 A: that's right normally we wait 'til we get hit first and then we go after 'em and [sigh] 

145.83 148.85 A: i guess this time nine eleven was 

149.03 154.32 A: that was probably the d- the hit we took and we're just not going to put up with it any more i guess that's the idea 

154.18 154.90 B: (( yeah )) 

155.10 160.46 A: so uh yeah i i can see the i can see the point to that you know because 

160.80 163.04 A: regardless of 

163.29 170.03 A: whether or not they understand you know we don't want to get [laughter] creamed [laughter] but yeah 

168.14 169.10 B: mhm 

170.35 175.71 A: i mean they they you know they had other reasons too you know since they were going over there to try to take care of 

176.18 184.56 A: potential terrorism on our soil you know they might as well in in the american opinion might as well to try to 

184.94 189.06 A: you know free these people too if they're going to have to take out s- saddam anyway 

188.97 189.65 B: (( yeah )) 

189.43 191.51 A: but yeah you can see why 

192.13 195.07 A: there would a lot of misunderstandings between the two groups 

194.97 201.37 B: mhm i think too they've done a good job the soldiers are trying to only target the 

195.86 196.72 A: so 

201.66 206.42 B: kind of government and the people who are making the choices we don't agree with in iraq 

206.12 206.98 A: right 

206.77 212.56 B: rather than just going and blowing up buildings that any innocent like 

212.59 216.42 B: resident of their country could be in that really doesn't have a say on what happens 

216.28 221.25 A: right and uh you know if they're going to use their own people for human shields 

221.85 223.75 A: [laughter] people are going to die 

223.65 224.53 B: mhm 

224.32 231.66 A: you know 'cause in order for us to accomplish the objective of taking out the the bad guys if they're going to put innocent people you know as shields 

231.97 235.52 A: those innocent people are going to get hurt unfortunately 

234.04 234.87 B: (( yeah )) 

236.09 237.40 A: and uh 

238.65 240.67 A: awful lot of grief over there right now 

240.67 241.58 B: mhm 

240.90 243.55 A: which is really heartbreaking to think about 

244.27 247.32 B: do you think that there will ever be peace in that area or 

248.33 251.20 A: well no i don't really until 

251.29 258.25 A: god himself intervenes i i believe that the creator does have a plan for that area and that the creator 

255.78 256.67 B: mhm 

259.11 262.46 A: is going to bring peace but i think he will be the only who can 

262.35 263.22 B: (( yeah )) 

262.71 264.89 A: i think until then there will be no peace 

264.92 265.92 B: mhm 

265.55 271.97 A: um it's just not a possible situation but i think when he intervenes then there will be 

272.12 273.80 B: yeah i agree too 

273.93 274.85 A: so 

274.26 275.98 B: but it's kind of like i 

276.18 280.23 B: mean obviously he has a plan that of course nobody understands but 

280.18 288.99 A: well actually he has laid it out fairly well i mean we don't understand all of it but we understand the basic parts you know he has communicated enough to us 

284.27 285.30 B: mhm 

289.51 292.86 A: to to give us a basic idea of what he's up to 

293.02 296.12 A: but certainly not all the details [laughter] 

295.13 295.94 B: (( yep )) 

296.15 297.42 A: (( and um )) 

297.80 304.88 A: so that's the important thing is to get what he what he has r- been willing to communicate to us it's very important i think to get that message 

304.29 305.30 B: mhm 

304.93 307.27 A: very firmly fixed um 

308.16 309.11 A: so 

310.06 311.92 A: uh you know it's been 

312.99 315.47 A: very good of him to to tell us what 

315.88 317.83 A: you know the important parts [laughter] 

317.84 318.69 B: [laughter] 

318.76 319.72 A: so 

319.84 322.17 A: i'm happy he did that 

322.05 322.63 B: (( mhm ))
