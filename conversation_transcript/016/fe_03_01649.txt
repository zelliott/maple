3.75 8.03 B: hi i'm barb gaylord and i live in north hampton pennsylvania 

7.89 14.21 A: okay we're not too far away so what do you [laughter] what do you think about what's going on over there with the war in iraq 

9.85 11.15 B: (( yeah )) 

14.16 15.73 B: ah well um 

17.30 24.56 B: i- i'm a little undecided about it i'm glad that it's um you know winding down i it seems that way anyway um 

24.05 24.65 A: (( [mn] )) 

24.85 33.26 B: i'm just you know i i don't know if there's ever going to be peace there it seems like there's always going to be problems there i don't know though how about you 

33.49 43.00 A: well i'm glad that it's winding down too it lasted longer than i thought but i definitely think there will be peace but i think it'll take some doing i mean because after saddam hussein 

42.77 49.77 A: that's all they know and they'll have to get a whole new form of government but i still think there'll always be some people over there who will resent us 

49.50 52.41 B: right right i agree there 

51.56 54.45 A: ri- right did you think it would take this long 

54.27 57.43 B: i thought i i actually thought it would be longer 

57.08 58.41 A: you did 

57.61 63.00 B: yeah i di- i didn't think it was [noise] the way they were talking it sounded like it was going to be 

63.25 68.00 B: um a longer thing but i don't know it's i don't know if it's 

68.29 71.45 B: they haven't officially said that it's over though correct 

71.00 76.75 A: right there's still some fighting from what i understand going on over there a little bit 

73.90 74.94 B: yeah 

75.89 78.79 B: you say you didn't really think it was going to last this long 

78.69 87.38 A: no actually my husband and i both thought that we would come go in there and we would scare 'em and they would kind of realize that we meant business and then give up 

86.99 88.09 B: right 

87.33 96.40 A: but i didn't realize that they you know that they would offer that much resistance i mean they were obviously there are a lot of people who think saddam is almost god 

95.97 97.43 B: right right 

97.21 98.84 A: do you think he's dead 

98.70 100.20 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

100.60 112.91 B: i don't know i've been watching the news today and and they're sounding more and more like you know it- it's a possibility he's still around and just hiding somewhere so [noise] i mean it could i mean 

113.00 119.34 B: i i hope that he is i know it's a terrible thing to say but um i don't know if he is i mean do you 

119.51 133.22 A: well you know i did at first and then i th- kind of thought to myself wouldn't this be just like him to make everybody think he is and then all of a sudden think that we've won and everything is going our way and then they come back and get us when our resistance is down 

132.63 142.40 B: exactly that's what i'm thinking too [noise] i'm i i just unless they have like proof that he's dead i am not going to believe he's dead you know what i mean 

134.89 137.08 A: (( [noise] )) 

142.28 149.52 B: i hope that he is but a- and it seems like he would be if their intelligence is right but [noise] you know it's hard to tell 

147.05 148.01 A: (( mhm i )) 

149.90 154.39 A: mean h- h- h- he's a cl- he's a clever man i i i i don't know 

154.23 165.99 A: and it seems to me we thought there was all those ch- that chemical weapons and warfare over there and we haven't found anything there and that's what baffles me if we were so sure there was why haven't we found it 

156.85 157.41 B: (( so )) 

164.14 165.15 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

165.55 167.66 B: yeah where is it exactly 

167.39 171.55 A: yes so i mean ah that's what i'm wondering if maybe that's what he thinks aha 

167.75 169.60 B: yeah 

171.70 173.21 A: i'll use that on you 

172.94 176.18 B: right right [noise] yeah 

175.35 186.18 A: i don't know [mn] so do you think that i mean if we settle this over here then there's going to be other countries that are going to feel the same as saddam and then we'll have to go to war with them or it's going to end here 

186.00 190.16 B: yeah i don't i don't know i i think there's like a lot [noise] of 

190.23 191.06 B: um 

192.25 193.89 B: [noise] i'm sorry 

194.00 200.98 B: there's like a lot of unrest out there so i don't what's what's um [noise] going to happen i don't know it's hard to say 

201.41 210.84 A: yeah i know i guess this whole thing for me started with nine eleven and i never thought anything like this would happen during my lifetime i don't think anybody did 

202.78 203.34 B: (( [noise] )) 

210.58 211.89 B: (( right )) 

211.20 213.05 A: yeah before there was um 

211.94 213.25 B: [noise] 

214.13 222.11 A: osama bin laden and that war and now there's this and it just leads me to think there might be more and maybe this is just going to keep going 

222.12 236.76 B: yeah i i i wish yeah there's l- i- it seems like it's g- that's the case to me anyway it [noise] it's like if it's not one pers- um if it's not one country it's going to be another one or or if it's gon- it's just going to be cells of terrorists and 

233.72 234.84 A: (( mhm )) 

236.69 239.12 B: i don't know it's pretty scary 

238.84 250.64 A: yeah 'cause they said these terrorists there's bands of them in all these other countries so that's what makes me think that okay so you get one country settled and you're just going to have to keep going on i mean then what's the answer 

240.32 240.98 B: (( [cough] )) 

250.33 252.58 B: exactly exactly 

252.40 261.06 A: i don't know i just i mean just think about it though if it were our country and we were being bombed and innocent people being killed even though 

261.43 267.33 A: this other country was stepping in for us i don't know if i'd feel that this other country was my friend if they killed my children 

267.00 268.09 B: right 

267.70 271.60 A: you know i can understand that you're right i guess i have mixed feelings too 

271.50 280.66 B: yeah i i- it's you know like i don't think anybody wants a war you know but i think it's all a matter of like you know how much you're going to put up with until 

280.89 289.11 B: you know until you're just going to lose it and and you're going to have to get rid of the bad guy or you know try to anyway 

289.13 290.62 B: yeah 

289.32 301.63 A: doesn't it strike you though for our generation as sophisticated as what we're supposed to me that we're still going out there killing the bad guy i mean like cowboys you know what i mean [laughter] i can't believe that we still do that to settle 

298.36 299.65 B: yeah 

301.91 305.45 B: i know i know it seems barbaric it does 

304.85 310.19 A: yeah th- that's something they did world war one world war two but not now 

305.72 306.58 B: (( i know ))

311.11 312.65 A: i don't know it just 

311.24 312.07 B: (( mm )) 

312.83 320.32 A: very very sad i was just so happy when the the prisoners were all released because i think we all thought they were going to be dead 

319.57 322.79 B: [mn] i know that was the best wasn't it um 

321.86 323.26 A: (( mhm yes )) 

322.76 331.18 B: yeah i i was just like well well the one girl i mean i thought that was the miracle itself 'cause she was all by herself and then they said that 

328.25 329.14 A: (( yeah )) 

330.95 343.93 B: there was oth- but those other like five of those other people that were rescued too they were with her right yeah so i mean i thought oh my god you know they only found her what about the rest of 'em but then you know that's 

336.75 337.77 A: yes 

343.74 347.73 B: yeah that was really good that's one nice thing that came out of 

348.28 354.34 A: did you did you happen to hear how these people are mentally if they're okay or i mean i haven't heard too much on that 

348.33 349.16 B: this 

353.77 362.03 B: yeah i really haven't either um i heard that the o- the one woman the black woman sh- i think her name is shoshana johnson 

360.85 362.81 A: yeah 

362.23 374.68 B: i heard that um when they found out like i guess after like they captured 'em and they found out she was a woman she said that they treated her really well they you know they didn't seem to bother her too much 

374.76 376.03 B: but um 

375.53 379.04 A: well they do kind of hold women in high regard over there don't they 

378.65 382.53 B: i ah i i think so i think well i don't know 

381.96 384.47 A: although they're not allowed to do a lot [laughter] 

383.38 392.42 B: do anything yeah exactly i was just going to say you know they're not allowed to do anything and they have to hide their faces all the time but [laughter] so i don't know but um 

392.38 399.17 B: but i don't as far as the other guys i don't know but i thought it was kind of weird how when they were on you know they showed that video 

398.82 399.88 A: mhm 

399.25 403.02 B: you know of them being c- they looked like they were terrified you know 

402.60 403.84 A: oh yeah 

403.03 411.84 B: and and i'm sure that they would be but it i i don't know it seems like they're all happy an- maybe they're just happy to be out right now and don't want to have to deal with 

412.01 414.71 B: everything that happened to 'em then i don't know 

414.76 418.70 A: and all those bodies they found where were they from ooh i 

418.26 420.53 B: (( yep yeah i don't )) 

419.81 420.76 A: (( know )) 

420.56 430.08 B: yeah it- it's sad i can't imagine like you know all the parents and young wives and stuff like to have people out there it's 

430.13 433.15 B: got to be a scary thing not knowing 

433.08 433.96 A: (( [mn] )) 

434.17 441.26 A: my husband and i were talking and we wonder if stuff like this keeps on if they'll bring the draft back and young men you know because nobody's going to wanna 

439.31 440.44 B: yeah 

441.66 443.24 A: wanna go over there 

442.66 455.02 B: yeah exactly you know my nephew um he ah he's going to be graduating from high school this year but before all this started he was he um was recruited by the army 

454.94 468.85 B: and and you know they gave him this big bonus you know fourteen thousand dollars you know when you join now and and now he's you know having second thoughts about it and like [mn] you know nobody wants him to go in but 

459.05 460.12 A: mhm 

468.93 472.10 B: i don't know if there's anything he can really do to get out of it 

471.97 475.70 A: i think once you're signed up you're signed up [noise] it just 

473.90 475.25 B: yeah 

476.13 476.88 B: (( [cough] )) 

476.65 482.48 A: i don't know [laughter] i mean you know all he had to do was just show us where those weapons were 

482.55 491.98 A: stop it and all this could have been avoided it seems to me he never really loved his country if he was willing to let all these people die because he said in his one speech we'll die with dignity 

492.21 493.37 B: yeah 

493.53 494.70 A: i don't know 

494.60 496.87 B: (( yeah i don't know either )) 

497.07 503.13 B: i i mean i i that's that's the one thing that's really bothering me too is like where are these things you know 

503.46 504.35 B: (( um )) 

503.82 512.73 A: yeah that's what i i'd like to know ah finally i mean this that was the whole point why we did this i'd like them to find them 'cause if all this ends i don't know what was your name again 

512.47 513.29 B: barb 

513.01 515.31 A: that's what i thought if all this ends barb 

513.70 514.69 B: mhm 

515.57 519.97 A: and we don't find them are people going to be thinking all this for nothing 

519.52 525.07 B: [noise] i know an- and what's it going to s- say for our country too like are we going to just go in and 

525.19 526.18 B: you know 

526.12 526.95 A: mhm 

526.53 532.97 B: because people you know like we have weapon of mass destruction do you know what i mean i i know this is all 

531.05 532.15 A: mhm 

532.78 541.30 B: you know this is kind of different because i think that was a whole part of the first gulf war was that um saddam saddam hussein was saying he 

541.07 550.22 B: was- wasn't going to produce weapons of mass destruction and that was all part of the u._n. pact or whatever but um or the peace treaty 

544.44 545.59 A: mhm 

550.22 558.05 B: and i don't know i i just think it's funny that it's okay that you know we have 'em but yet 

557.34 560.50 A: yeah but we we expect them not to have 'em 

559.96 565.78 B: e- exactly [noise] i i don't get that that's what's a little crazy about the whole thing too but 

565.53 568.99 A: and then if they don't have 'em why are they all equipped with gas masks 

568.92 570.80 B: yeah yeah 

570.12 576.34 A: i mean [laughter] why would they be issuing them ah if they weren't there there's so many conflicts i just don't understand 

573.01 574.11 B: right 

576.17 587.07 B: yeah don't you wish you could just go over you know be a fly on the wall and find out like [laughter] where this guy is and if there really is something you know out there that 

580.26 582.04 A: [laughter] 

586.87 591.43 A: yeah and do you think that him and what's his name osama they are 

591.66 598.16 A: [mn] you know i mean related to ea- not related physically but you know connected and this is all al qaeda and all this 

594.15 595.29 B: yeah 

597.88 599.89 B: i don't know you know i'd
