5.37 7.02 B: good how are you this evening 

6.44 8.65 A: good where are you calling from 

8.70 10.78 B: g- from ah pennsylvania 

10.18 11.31 A: whereabouts

14.62 16.59 A: yeah i live in new jersey 

16.31 18.00 B: oh okay 

17.48 19.96 A: so have you done this before 

19.71 20.66 B: yes 

20.26 29.33 A: okay um yeah but i it's very like i don't know if we're doing it right or [laughter] you know they don't give you much feedback so 

21.18 22.05 B: have you 

22.39 24.16 B: (( yeah )) 

26.06 27.81 B: (( y- yeah )) 

28.68 30.80 B: no they don't 

29.64 35.50 A: yeah um so we're just supposed to talk about ah the middle east 

35.21 36.12 B: right 

36.09 37.48 A: um 

37.30 41.63 A: do y- i mean i think i th- one question was do we think that ah 

41.42 54.91 A: the united states should stay involved and i think that we should because when with desert storm we pulled out and you know pretty much left it up to them to take care of it and we were right back where we started from 

55.25 58.61 A: so i mean i'm not that politically ah 

58.94 63.98 A: educated but from what i gather that's what happened 

63.93 73.24 B: [mn] yeah i'm not politically educated either but i agree with you i think i i think we did that's what happened they pulled out too soon and i think they should stay this time 

66.47 69.12 A: okay [laughter] 

70.08 71.21 A: yeah 

72.78 74.04 A: yeah 

73.39 78.03 B: although the people seem to be against us now at first they were all for us 

77.64 79.01 A: yeah 

78.57 80.43 B: and now they want us out of there 

80.21 86.55 A: well i think that they want their land back probably but i mean i think we have to we have to 

86.42 96.12 A: stay somewhat involved i mean our troops are still there and we still have th- aren't there still prisoners of war even ar- right i mean i think we got some of them back but 

96.30 98.39 A: i think there's still some prisoners there 

98.28 100.22 B: yeah 

98.90 101.34 A: um but ah y- 

100.44 104.14 B: and i think they have to look for tho- those weapons of mass destruction 

103.57 113.19 A: yeah and then with syria if we ha- you know is is saddam hussein in syria and or is he dead you know i think he's probably dead at this point but 

113.26 114.26 A: um 

114.37 115.36 A: you know 

115.54 118.99 A: i i don't know [mn] i don't know that much 

119.25 125.97 A: (( this is a difficult topic for them to talk about [laughter] for ten minutes what if you don't know that much about it )) 

121.65 124.69 B: (( yeah it is it is a little bit )) 

125.59 132.59 B: right i don't either but i i don't know as much as they fight over there i don't think that peace will ever be attained over there [mn] 

126.95 128.12 A: (( oh man )) 

131.58 135.36 A: i don't think there's going to be world wide peace ever anywhere 

135.28 136.13 B: uh-uh 

135.68 138.68 A: but ah i mean it's just i think 

138.65 153.00 A: i think they've been capturing i heard something on the radio about there's like they have a a deck of playing cards with fifty two like top um you know like evil [laughter] iraqi powerful you know 

153.17 160.63 A: whatever they are you know leaders and i think they've ha- they have like seven of them in in in ah in capture right now 

160.53 161.47 B: oh 

160.90 164.57 A: so that's a lot of ah a lot of people left 

164.62 167.45 A: you know that they haven't caught and yeah 

164.63 166.66 B: yeah to ge- to get 

167.34 171.85 B: and i think some of those probably are involved in this terrorist thing that went on in the u._s. too so 

171.01 173.96 A: ah yeah i definitely think so i mean 

173.18 179.29 B: that's another reason i think we should stay and monitor what's going on and have our presence felt over there 

176.36 178.38 A: mhm 

178.43 183.79 A: and find those ah find the see if they if they do have the weapons that they you know they 

179.55 180.41 B: (( [noise] )) 

183.71 194.38 A: keep saying they don't have and we keep saying they do have and i heard today also that they think that they destroyed them days before the attack which i don't buy i mean it has to be 

194.60 196.08 A: has to be somewhere 

196.65 197.80 B: (( yeah i )) 

196.86 197.77 A: so 

197.99 201.86 B: yeah i don't know if he destroyed 'em either 'cause i think he thought he was going to win 

198.28 198.97 A: (( mm )) 

199.74 200.78 A: yeah 

201.88 214.01 A: yeah definitel- well i mean it's silly tha- that people are like thinking that he's still alive but there's so many there's there's st- there's footage of him like you know walking around town and 

214.00 214.96 A: (( our )) 

214.89 224.59 A: our ability to know what's going on there and and know if there was such an uproar of you know supporters and what not we would we would know that 

224.47 233.06 A: you know they're saying we're that we're like two days behind or something like that but i don't know i don't d- i don't necessarily think that he's still alive 

224.65 226.48 B: yeah 

233.19 234.34 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

233.71 237.77 A: but ah i mean his sons may be i don't i don't know but [sigh] 

238.56 239.52 A: so 

239.56 240.61 A: (( i don't know )) 

239.61 244.53 B: i don't know i think the people will probably kill him if he does come up anyhow his own people 

242.89 244.02 A: yeah 

244.25 246.81 A: but you said that they're saying that 

246.88 250.83 A: that they're they're showing that they don't want us there anymore i haven't heard that what 

251.27 255.58 B: [cough] over the weekend they were showing that they wanted the americans out of there now 

251.51 252.24 A: (( w- )) 

255.18 256.07 A: really 

255.87 257.17 B: (( yeah and i )) 

257.32 261.28 B: i don't know i'm thinking well here we come over and we rescued you and 

260.57 266.49 A: well they made such a they made such a big deal about remember the guy who put the american flag over 

266.42 276.96 A: over the statue and they made him take it down so i think that i think that the american troops and the british troops made a very valiant effort not to 

267.75 269.55 B: yeah 

276.99 281.87 A: claim control but just to help and and give aid 

281.91 289.69 A: so i i don't know there must be a lot of controversy there too because there's there's these people are raised you know brainwashed 

289.64 301.94 A: to believe that this guy was you know the best thing in the world and and then my dad was telling me over the weekend that they found like billions of dollars um in in some in one of um 

289.78 290.80 B: (( yes )) 

301.83 316.56 A: like one of his houses or something there was like a fake wall and they found like i think it was like five hundred thousand dollar eh five hundred thousand dollars in like boxes like maybe it was like a you know ten by ten by ten 

316.61 328.89 A: ah like box and they found like you know ten a hundred thousand dolla- or five hundred thousand dollars in each of these boxes and there's like hundreds of them so there's like billions of dollars that was just recovered 

325.70 327.04 B: wow 

329.05 342.44 A: so but now they're wondering what to do with all this money do w- do they give it to the do they give it to the iraqis do they give some like they were saying like seventy percent to the iraqis and then you know like ten percent to 

342.42 348.61 A: the british and american um you know casualties like the families that were killed and then 

348.46 361.39 A: the the rest go into like the oil fields and all that so i don't know this is all things that my father tells me i don't know if it's right or not but [laughter] it just gives us something to talk about though [laughter] 

352.33 353.70 B: huh 

356.77 359.41 B: oh it probably is my goodness 

360.03 367.13 B: yeah yeah do you do you think they're going to be capable of um keeping peace over there themselves if they're 

366.10 371.69 A: um themselves i mean it depends on they have to have leaders 

371.83 375.13 A: so it depends on who becomes the leader 

375.25 378.34 A: you know it depends on on who 

378.63 381.80 A: if it's if it's just the guys that are there now 

378.89 382.10 B: (( yeah )) 

382.13 386.11 A: you know that didn't have as much of a play 

386.15 388.65 A: that they couldn't have had any play you know 

389.13 397.56 A: [mn] i don't know it's like you know when when the president goes it's the vice president kind of thing and then the secretary you know like i don't know i don't know how that would work 

394.47 395.94 B: right 

397.29 402.73 B: right and w- we know that's how it goes and everything and over there they haven't had anybody stand out but him 

397.62 399.00 A: unless the peop- 

401.73 403.19 A: exactly 

402.88 404.84 B: yeah 

403.21 412.91 A: so i don't know [cough] if it's something that the people would even be capable of of legislating because they don't know any better they don't know how 

409.93 411.43 B: mhm 

413.16 422.41 A: they don't know that the- that they can have rights and you know and as far as history goes [cough] when other countries were liberated i don't know 

422.76 424.26 A: you know when when 

424.46 431.24 A: like when france was liberated from ah from hitler like what happened then like who took over do you know any of that 

430.59 433.59 B: (( [mn] no i don't )) 

431.46 434.04 A: yeah i don't know i don't know how that would work 

433.78 439.64 B: yeah and i haven't heard anybody any name come up or anything stand out 

434.87 436.52 A: (( but ah )) 

438.78 440.03 A: yeah 

439.77 444.26 B: and i i think most of their political prisoners were dead so that anybody that 

440.32 442.03 A: just people right now 

442.80 450.95 A: yeah and a lot of people are just turning themselves in right now too so i don't know i don't know if it could even be one of them because they were 

447.01 449.53 B: yeah 

451.25 452.34 A: they were with 

452.37 454.84 A: with saddam hussein for so long so 

454.54 459.06 B: yeah yeah and they might want to take it back the way it was 

456.59 465.26 A: [cough] and they all seem to be related at that p- [laughter] they're all like cousins and brothers and in laws and it's sick [laughter] 

459.79 460.79 B: [laughter] 

463.28 464.42 B: yeah 

464.66 470.66 B: yeah [noise] ah yeah i think that's gonna be hard one and i think syria's gonna be there 

465.80 467.05 A: (( so i don't know )) 

468.68 469.64 A: uh-huh 

470.83 472.04 A: yeah 

470.93 472.96 B: [mn] trying to push in too 

472.50 476.32 A: yeah but it seems like we h- we need to go to syria now because 

476.42 486.33 A: they're you know they're they're supporting they've been supporting iraq and giving jerusalem or you know israel a hard time and you know 

486.35 496.83 A: you can't just we just like you have to you know chip away at this you can't just go one place and then it's over that's kind of what happened with ah with desert storm 

493.08 495.00 B: yeah 

496.66 504.42 B: yeah and i- and iran was so bad there for a while and they've been quiet for a while and you wonder if they're going to come back in the mix of things again 

497.52 498.41 A: so 

501.49 502.86 A: mhm 

503.07 504.61 A: exactly 

504.87 506.40 B: yeah 

504.94 507.95 A: but now ah but now france and ah 

508.39 511.95 A: who was the other one germany that didn't want to help us 

512.22 513.69 B: yeah 

512.67 515.44 A: and now they're saying like you know 

515.54 522.32 A: that it was good that we did it and you know and like now that after it after it's all over you know they're they're applauding us 

522.35 524.52 B: [noise] mhm 

523.13 524.28 A: but um 

524.53 529.19 B: [mn] and i don't know if sending the u._n. in will help that much either because the u._n. doesn't seem to 

528.63 536.38 A: yeah they weren't helpful in the beginning right th- they were the ones that didn't want to go through with all this and and bush was saying you know i'm going to do with it without you 

530.30 532.19 B: yeah 

536.55 544.58 B: yeah but i mean they've been over there and the people know that those inspectors have been over there and didn't do anything and i don't know if that'll help keep the peace or not 

537.01 537.86 A: (( so )) 

537.95 538.92 A: (( i don't know )) 

541.55 542.67 A: mhm

545.64 547.48 B: yeah that's a tough one 

547.24 550.61 A: yeah and i [cough] i was really ah 

551.03 562.23 A: watching a lot in the beginning but it just like it seems like the same thing over and over and over and at this point and i'm just like i've had enough that is terrible i'm like ashamed to even say that but 

557.03 557.83 B: yes 

561.88 564.53 B: yeah me too but it is yeah 

562.52 563.55 A: [laughter] 

563.94 567.81 A: i don't know enough to even understand what you know even 

567.86 572.10 A: th- th- the icing of this let alone you know the whole 

572.35 574.91 A: the whole mix of everything that's going on 

574.74 577.92 B: i agree with you and then when they explain it they're way over my head 

577.47 581.90 A: uh-huh [laughter] that's why i get the footno- the footnotes from my dad 

578.19 579.63 B: (( [cough] mhm )) 

581.98 587.86 B: yeah 'cause they get these generals on there and they say all this stuff and you have no clue what they're talking about [sigh] i 

582.21 584.04 A: [laughter] 

584.37 584.97 A: (( uh-huh )) 

585.37 586.99 A: [laughter]

597.03 598.09 A: (( [sigh] so )) 

597.27 599.89 B: do- maybe some of the people that have taken refuge
