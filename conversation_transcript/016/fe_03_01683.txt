0.71 2.33 A: hi i'm cynthia 

2.26 5.02 B: hi cynthia i'm alan i'm from portland oregon 

5.07 8.43 A: i'm from uh new york well right now i'm living in brooklyn new york 

8.63 9.90 B: oh okay 

10.13 11.31 A: [laughter] 

11.07 15.29 B: well let me tell you a little bit how i feel about this particular thing 

14.74 15.64 A: okay 

15.66 21.64 B: um i am a a very big peace advocate i'm not a confrontational person at all 

21.53 22.51 A: mhm 

21.87 32.79 B: and i'm a very staunch democrat even liber- libertarian um so i i firmly believe that we did not pursue enough peace as- peaceful aspects 

26.40 27.30 A: okay 

32.88 34.72 B: involved in the conflict 

34.35 35.24 A: mhm 

35.12 39.78 B: um but in the same respects we've had some huge anti war demonstrations here 

39.72 51.36 B: where the people who are involved in it broke the laws in order to to protest the war and i don't believe in that i mean once we're there once we were once we're there we're there 

39.75 40.84 A: mhm 

45.28 46.23 A: right 

47.15 48.10 A: right 

51.63 56.46 B: you know there there's kinda really not a whole lot of choice once it's decided 

55.76 66.56 A: see the funny thing i understood the question to be not just about or not focused on the war this war so much as the whole sort of unrest in the region did you get that or no 

67.07 71.89 B: um well yeah kind of i just started it out with that 

70.81 76.88 A: [laughter] okay [laughter] i mean it is sort of you know it is obviously what's on the top of the mind ah 

76.67 78.59 B: oh yeah 

76.86 87.99 A: in terms of right now you know but i guess in my mind you see i my background i guess i would say politically i sound similar to you um [lipsmack] but i also lived in the middle east for a little while 

88.49 92.27 A: um [noise] i was studying the palestinian israeli conflict 

92.58 101.83 A: so i tend to have a kind of i guess that's where my mind goes first is to sort of that part of the region and what's going on there um 

102.11 104.92 A: but i i think i have a 

105.16 109.79 A: i don't know i agree i had very mixed feelings about all the protests um 

110.13 113.74 A: i sort of had the attitude of you know okay m- 

113.75 117.82 A: well maybe i don't support the war but i do support the the people who are there are 

117.85 127.32 A: our troops even are just doing their job at a certain point they're there because you know they're trying to feed their families a lot of them and a lot of them themselves they're unsure if they want to be there 

127.52 128.40 B: right 

127.68 133.16 A: and protesting doesn't necessarily i mean if that's the sort of image that they're getting of what's going on here 

133.61 136.08 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] it doesn't really make them feel like 

136.41 143.40 A: good about themselves putting their lives on the line [laughter] which maybe we is not our responsibility but um i think it 

143.33 152.73 A: you know it's sort of it's already a hard place for them to be in especially those soldiers that were in a kind of themselves in a morally questioning place 

152.78 154.52 B: right 

153.65 154.74 A: but um 

155.38 159.70 A: yeah i don't know i mean i feel like when i lived there i kind of 

159.73 161.31 A: became 

161.52 164.34 A: pretty sceptical about um 

165.25 172.92 A: i mean i sort of went you know in terms of looking at dialogging and all this stuff and and the longer i spent um 

172.98 175.48 A: there the kind of less i felt 

175.61 181.33 A: i felt like there were have been moments in history where the pe- the a lot of these techniques could have been very useful 

181.79 195.14 A: [lipsmack] but i don't have a lot of um faith that in the next you know ten to twenty years at least um there's going to be the possibility for a real and lasting peace in that region personally 

195.29 200.40 A: um which maybe sounds pessimistic but just from my experiences talking to people 

200.53 201.51 A: um 

201.92 204.31 A: has kind of led me to that belief 

205.77 212.67 B: oh i i firmly agree i mean i i look at it and there's no one over there who has a 

213.16 218.03 B: who would r- a- who's in power in any way who would truly benefit by peace 

217.73 218.67 A: right 

218.60 220.05 B: but you know they're all 

218.79 221.01 A: (( that's right [laughter] )) 

221.22 229.83 B: you know and what are we going to do are we going to go over and beat everybody up and take their place and say okay now we're going to control it well then we're just bad as the guy that was there beforehand 

227.12 228.48 A: right 

229.87 235.53 A: absolutely absolutely yeah i mean and that's the thing is i mean now we put ourselves 

231.26 231.96 B: (( you know )) 

235.40 245.46 A: i mean i you know whether or not we had a a moral obligation to go into iraq is certainly very questionable on on lots of sides but we definitely put ourself in um 

245.95 251.05 A: ourselves the u._s. in a in a really very morally compromising situation now 

250.88 252.57 A: i think because 

252.40 263.43 A: um we're sort of damned no matter what we do pretty much i mean [laughter] you know unless we somehow magically s- you know set up from behind the scene you know without having 

256.68 257.94 B: (( [noise] right )) 

263.26 270.63 A: uh [noise] too much influence the most uh democratic and and the happiest uh [noise] government the middle east [noise] has ever seen 

271.03 277.12 A: there's going to be a lot of backlash from the fact that we are in there and that we are having a lot of influence um 

277.62 278.74 A: i think 

278.91 290.13 B: right [noise] yeah i i i would i would agree very much i mean you know we put saddam hussein in power in the first place twenty years later we're taking him out 

279.88 281.12 A: but 

288.44 289.13 A: (( right )) 

289.74 296.02 A: [laughter] right i mean it's similar unfortunately it's similar to the fact that you know we had trained osama bin laden 

296.05 304.51 A: um and many others in that in that region in many of the techniques that they were then able to use to kind of invade us 

304.67 305.49 A: um 

304.72 306.06 B: right 

305.73 310.38 A: it just has to do with who we what side we happen to be on at the moment you know 

310.44 312.51 A: kind of fickle that way so 

310.48 311.45 B: right 

312.65 314.82 A: i don't know i think um 

315.18 324.21 A: my problem is i just get so overwhelmed i just get i sort of come back at a certain point i'm like i can't watch news any more i can't think about it any more because 

324.06 335.68 A: i'm here [laughter] you know in a way the best thing i can do maybe is just to try and live my daily life in a peaceful way you know as you were saying like just trying not to be a aggressive person 

326.10 326.94 B: right 

336.09 337.32 B: oh right 

336.13 343.12 A: seems almost the most helpful thing that one can do or not even not just aggressive but sort of uh move- someone who moves towards peace 

343.36 344.32 A: um 

343.45 345.10 B: right 

344.61 349.84 A: but that's hard to do you know it's hard to actualize in a in the smallest ways 

348.14 349.05 B: (( oh i )) 

350.01 354.24 B: yeah it definitely is i mean i i have friends who are over there right now 

354.22 366.25 B: and i'm really concerned that they're you know they may never come home and yet i you know a- as much as i disagree with the war that's why i wouldn't protest it because they're there you know i don't want 

358.32 359.20 A: right 

365.67 366.36 A: right 

366.21 373.07 B: me to happen to get filmed and see one of my and my one of my buddies just catch it and think that i'm you know trying to get him 

373.13 373.95 B: you know 

374.20 375.91 B: not supporting him 

375.66 376.63 A: right 

376.76 386.94 B: but in the s- you know and in the same respects they didn't want to be there i mean they're national guard they're not army m- you you know they're not career military people so you know 

381.02 381.96 A: right 

387.38 388.80 B: out here in oregon 

387.56 388.47 A: and even 

389.07 390.84 A: sorry go ahead out here in oregon 

390.76 401.45 B: out out here in oregon the national guard went before the the career military people did so we s- 'cause we you know we don't have the security alerts that you guys are having back there 

394.85 395.60 A: huh 

395.87 397.03 A: wow 

401.26 402.85 A: right 

402.87 415.33 A: right huh that's interesting yeah i mean here it's like y- you know all of a sudden you feel like you're living in an armed city i mean if we walk around i literally have like the subway station when i go to work i have 

415.34 424.32 A: soldiers with you know huge guns [laughter] in my subway station i mean it's scary it's very scary because it feels 

420.92 421.99 B: wow 

424.67 434.60 A: like a kind of militarization that you know if it went corrupt would be very dangerous i mean these guys have the right to 

432.39 433.35 B: right 

434.70 437.93 A: you know kind of suppose whatever they want to suppose about you 

438.01 438.81 A: um 

438.95 446.84 A: and i'm just you know i'm like this little white girl going to work you know i'm a teacher i mean i'm not there's no reason for me particularly to be afraid 

446.80 456.39 A: but it it doesn't matter i mean you have this kind of atmosphere of fear i think um here particularly here you know obviously but um 

452.85 453.83 B: right 

457.15 463.91 A: yeah i i know what you mean i think that even with the career military there's so many people now that are going into military because 

463.86 475.60 A: they're single parents or because they you know it's just that it's almost it's so much more for the steady job for most people [laughter] than it even has to do with you know they're just hoping that they can serve their time 

475.56 480.38 A: you know be in the reserves or whatever and get a tuition break or college or whatever 

480.69 484.56 A: and get out without getting killed i mean i think a lot of people now who are 

485.06 490.50 A: in the armed services aren't there necessarily because they want to be you know in battle 

490.83 493.42 B: oh yeah i i would have to agree i mean 

493.31 504.38 B: like i was saying the people that i knew the uh one of them he wanted to get away from all of his friends who were winding up in jail for drugs he didn't want to go down that road and the military was a way to you know 

500.12 501.30 A: exactly 

504.19 509.82 B: to make a living to to help support you know his family 'cause he comes from a very uh 

510.48 520.88 B: hi- hierarchy family where you know the family lives together or lives within a couple of blocks of each other and that way he could send money to his family and still be producing something and you know 

520.91 524.40 B: not not wind up in jail like half of his friends did 

524.08 530.06 A: absolutely no i know i mean um i had a friend who went into the military 

530.20 535.28 A: you know he w- he got [noise] [mn] kicked out of some schools and then just sort of dropped out and 

535.29 537.05 A: and um 

537.85 541.29 A: you know it was really like the last sort of option 

541.23 550.44 A: that was legal [laughter] you know in terms of figuring out what he was going to do with himself and in his case you know he was lucky and he got out before this war and 

543.73 544.67 B: right 

550.35 556.53 A: he actually started going you know finishing his high school degree or whatever on on the boats when 

556.42 567.51 A: when he was [mn] you know they would let them take history classes or something [laughter] on the boats that he was serving on and you know and it it served him really well and i think that's why people do it because it can work 

567.44 575.48 B: oh yeah it's a great way for people to straighten themselves out or to get ahead in life and stuff like that if that's what works for you 

575.72 581.48 B: and unfortunately a a lot of people who'd looked at it that way are now stuck in a place where they got guns aimed at their heads 

582.17 583.11 A: (( [noise] ))
