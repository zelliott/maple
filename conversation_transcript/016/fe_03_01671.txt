38.94 42.67 B: [lipsmack] ah you suspect our government's why we're there huh

66.59 78.42 B: she i think they asked about you know do you think we should be there and are we i mean i'm afraid we're going to be stuck there for a long time even if even if they had good intentions which i'm not sure they did 

73.12 74.79 A: (( ah yeah )) 

78.35 82.12 B: ah i agree with you i mean it's very suspect 

82.33 84.01 B: and i guess my 

84.05 97.46 B: as far as the war i mean i was very upset that we didn't use the u._n. and and follow that process out more ah and we sort of made ourselves an outlaw in the world community it seems to me so 

91.12 92.15 A: right 

96.19 104.92 A: [laughter] basically i th- i think that they're gonna i mean right now we're too strong [laughter] ah and i- 

97.64 99.20 B: (( yeah you know )) 

104.10 109.74 B: we're very strong and we're the only we're really the only superpower now that's for sure 

105.06 106.57 A: (( i- it's )) 

108.82 112.44 A: exactly and and that that can be very dangerous 

111.76 114.43 B: absolutely absolutely 

112.95 115.10 A: (( and um i )) 

115.13 120.22 A: don't know the whole thing is crazy to me but i i i huh 

118.05 124.32 B: you sound like you're i was going to say you sound like somebody who'd be about the age group to be over there 

124.25 127.62 A: oh y- exact- [laughter] i'm twenty 

124.82 126.23 B: you sound young 

126.38 128.74 B: you sound like you might be college 

128.58 129.65 A: yes 

129.16 132.89 B: yes and do you h- do you know anybody in the military 

129.97 130.85 A: yes 

132.71 145.82 A: i know a few people and you know th- the reason why i didn't join the military ah i'm very much so into ah into my religion and i hate to say religion but ah i 

133.72 134.71 B: yeah 

145.87 151.16 A: i just can't see s- killing somebody for a reason i truly don't stand for 

148.53 152.85 B: mhm well good for you that's good for you fortunately 

152.97 161.72 B: ah we don't have a draft right now so you don't have to even officially do anything about that you know so i grew up in the sixties i remember ah 

158.41 159.24 A: right 

161.97 172.09 B: h- how that was played out you know it was a really hard time and kids having to make very difficult decisions so i guess we ought to get back to our topic about the middle east 

168.55 169.68 A: (( yeah exactly )) 

170.99 173.77 A: okay [laughter] right 

172.73 176.17 B: i could get off on on that easily um 

176.17 182.67 B: [mn] well what about ah you know in the long term do you think that even though we got in there for 

182.54 191.35 B: ah you know yo- you suspected for money or for oil money whatever do you think now that we're there we can help those people 

191.71 193.88 A: i i think so but 

193.79 198.14 A: ah and i think that goes onto the peace subject they were talking about 

197.90 209.22 A: there's a lot of people over there that resent us [laughter] [laughter] they a- a- and ah and not only there but i mean i- i- it's hard to to imagine 

199.89 203.58 B: [lipsmack] boy that is scary isn't it scary 

206.70 207.73 B: mhm 

209.16 220.12 A: you know if if you passionately hate some h- hate a certain person a country or or a type of people for them to just you know all of a sudden surrender 

212.18 213.21 B: mhm 

213.44 214.53 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

220.15 227.61 A: and they've proven without a doubt that you know once they believe in something they're willing to go at all cost 

224.91 226.19 B: mhm 

227.32 239.25 B: i that's i agree with you that to me is the scariest proposition all those people who are willing to die for allah and just come up and set themselves off as a bomb i mean 

228.23 229.14 A: and 

239.11 247.18 B: that is that's just outside our way of thinking i think ah to me anyhow i just don't get it you know 

247.03 256.73 B: and i think our our military people who are over there i mean not too many of them thank god died in the war but i think an awful lot them could die 

247.05 248.28 A: well i 

254.37 255.52 A: right 

256.79 263.61 B: (( in those kinds of things you know for what you know it's sad and [mn] i i )) 

257.22 258.36 A: exactly 

264.20 271.04 B: was born just before the korean war and we're still in korea fifty years later so i mean i don't i really don't know why 

268.85 269.57 A: (( [noise] exactly )) 

271.03 285.19 B: so i that's what i'm afraid of it's we're either gonna be there so long to keep it down or being irish i know how the irish people resented the british people com- the brits coming in to northern ireland and so forth so 

271.28 272.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

285.14 285.98 A: right 

285.25 298.04 B: you know it could be really awful really could be a horrible situation and and a lot of people could die over there i think that's what i'm afraid of you know whatever got us in there we're there now 

297.88 299.11 A: exactly 

298.50 299.37 B: so 

299.51 303.04 A: well i was brought up to believe believe 

303.09 305.87 A: [mn] nothing you hear and half of what you see 

305.46 320.21 B: [lipsmack] well you're ab- i see now that's it's kinda scary i mean i'm i'm ju- now i'm just i'm surprised you sound young and that seems like a you know to me that's like s- an older pe- person's opinion you know but maybe that's the way your parents looked at it i'm i'm i'm 

307.14 308.89 A: [laughter] 

309.00 310.89 A: and and 

316.11 317.47 A: (( well i i )) 

318.32 324.15 A: (( yeah well i'm i'm from the country so [laughter] i'm from the country i still have )) 

321.28 322.44 B: you're what 

323.37 332.06 B: you're from the country well maybe that's a good way to be maybe that's a very good way to be you know don't don't because today god knows 

324.70 325.39 A: yeah 

331.89 346.19 B: ah there are people out there are gonna hurt you and they're lying to us we've seen it you know you've seen people we've seen people [laughter] lie to our faces and swear up and down so you know it's it wouldn't be anything new that's for sure 

336.79 338.66 A: (( yeah exactly and )) 

346.17 349.56 B: but i don't know you know it's it's ah 

349.76 356.63 B: a- and i don't know if we're ever gonna change people's hearts and minds i guess it is their hearts that we probably have to change you know 

354.20 354.99 A: right 

356.78 360.49 B: but what about that it sounds like you're a pretty religious person 

360.50 363.63 B: um do you think that you know 

363.69 370.63 B: [mn] now they want a they want a relig- some people over there anyhow i saw them there demonstrating they want a religious 

370.70 371.85 B: government 

371.66 380.13 A: i a- and that that that's the thing what kind of government can you set up there because it is so diverse over there it's not you know [mn] 

378.23 379.29 B: mhm 

380.05 390.26 A: and you can read up anywhere that it is diverse over there you can't have one set religious government without somebody [laughter] not being happy with it 

383.66 384.72 B: mhm 

389.58 398.83 B: well i'll you wh- i wouldn't be happy if i was a woman over there right now because most of those religious governments don't do much for women i mean 

390.62 392.00 A: (( and mm )) 

398.72 403.93 B: put them down cover them up and keep them quiet you know [laughter] and 

398.88 399.71 A: true 

402.68 403.54 A: right 

403.77 414.82 B: i mean th- i mean they it could end up being worse in iraq well i don't know if it was how bad it was it sounds like some of the bad stuff is coming out now the torture chambers and stuff but i don't know 

414.75 418.98 B: i don't know i just as a woman that part of the world 

419.08 424.92 B: ah certainly it's not a very inviting place i feel sorry for those people 

423.10 424.44 A: well they 

425.13 431.35 A: well well looking at that that point they are i mean they're they're extremely ol- old fashioned 

430.83 431.89 B: mhm 

431.55 434.02 A: and i believe that that transition [laughter] 

432.96 438.54 B: yeah like the fourteenth century [laughter] that's pretty old fashioned [laughter] 

435.02 436.04 A: well 

438.01 445.22 A: well i'll tell you what though i i tell you one thing i i mean there are certain goods and there's certain bads 

444.53 445.48 B: mhm 

445.26 449.44 A: and you know people always say be mindful of your past 

449.28 461.85 A: and i- i'm i'm thinking you know you got certain things that you wouldn't do nowadays that that was back then or things was going on over there but they have some aspects that we can learn from 

461.69 462.71 B: mhm 

462.51 468.01 A: because the patriotism although it mind be you know harmful to us 

467.06 479.49 B: misguided [laughter] there's well i think you'd call it zealotry i mean it they're zealots for their and sometimes you do th- people like that are a little scary don't you think i mean 

469.14 470.77 A: [laughter] i mean 

478.48 480.86 A: exactly well their pride 

479.61 486.57 B: i don't know whether or not that's good really because you know what in their country you wouldn't be able to say 

482.36 483.14 A: (( i )) 

486.85 499.23 B: i'm not i wasn't for this war before it happened you know you could you can say that and and you should be able to say that and you should be able to go out and protest i wasn't for it but i didn't go and protest you know 

490.22 491.40 A: (( exactly w- )) 

499.20 500.49 A: (( w- w- )) 

499.40 505.82 B: but i think people should be able to express their views that's what w- this country is all about [lipsmack] 

505.22 513.10 A: an- an- and and and it's funny you say that because to me i feel that we have a conditional freedom of speech 

513.83 516.28 B: a conditional freedom of speech 

515.91 524.72 A: and i say that because ah the people that opposed this war i i listened to bill o'reilly and and 

520.68 521.67 B: mhm 

523.39 528.78 B: mm oh you [laughter] we don't want to you don't want to go against some of those guys huh 

525.34 526.65 A: all these 

527.88 534.38 A: we- exac- well well see the thing is is that if you're opposed of what the majority the masses are saying 

528.95 530.09 B: mhm 

531.68 534.55 B: mhm mhm mhm 

534.32 543.26 A: you know it's almost as if yo- your freedom of speech really don't mean anything [laughter] and you- you're actually being condemned for what you're saying [mn] 

539.02 540.14 B: that's right 

542.27 553.85 B: well and i think that's what's wrong i i agree with you and i but i think a lot of people also agree with you that you know we didn't you know didn't necessarily want this war 

553.73 554.65 A: right 

553.80 567.52 B: and just because we disagree doesn't mean we're no less patriots or don't love this country or whatever and th- that is important it's important to keep reminding people of that that you know 

562.33 563.55 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

567.58 578.23 B: we're allowed to disagree i'm not i can't remember which famous statesman said ah y- i may not agree with your views but i'll defend to the death your right to say them 

578.39 581.25 B: and so that's what really we have to be able 

578.58 579.49 A: right 

581.34 587.76 B: you know we may not agree but we have the right to say you know to voice our opinion 

587.63 588.75 A: (( [noise] [noise] exactly )) 

588.08 599.89 B: well at least we can say it on this phone call [laughter] let's hope they're not let's hope they're not sending it off to some horrible place [laughter] for it to be transcribed and they'll put us on the li 

597.47 599.89 A: [laughter] [laughter]
