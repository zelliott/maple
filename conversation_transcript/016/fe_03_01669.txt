190.87 192.75 A: (( yeah )) 

191.71 197.65 B: i don't think that's right i think they should have to do all that they have all the oil over there they should be restoring everything 

192.99 193.88 A: no 

197.56 201.78 A: well that's what they said they want to start selling it so they can have the money to 

201.15 205.21 B: they they need to actually they need to take all of that stuff that saddam has 

205.03 206.21 A: mhm 

205.58 208.96 B: all of his personals and all of that and sell it and use that money 

208.66 210.52 A: yeah definitely 

209.07 211.40 B: instead of having us ship over our money 

211.85 214.43 A: that- that's very true they should do that 

213.45 218.96 B: and they should take some o- some of that money and split it through all the people that they sent over there to fight 

218.25 219.24 A: yeah 

220.01 222.43 A: yeah you're right i agree with you
