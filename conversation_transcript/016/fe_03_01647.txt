0.38 1.52 B: hello 

0.99 2.36 A: (( hello )) 

1.91 4.90 B: hi my name's karen sao 

3.95 6.69 A: hi karen my name is barbara 

6.34 8.22 B: oh where do you work 

7.81 14.73 A: ah well my husband and i own a small sub shop a sandwich shop [mn] take out place 

14.54 26.01 B: oh i work in an engineering company and it's part of horizon [laughter] [laughter] so ah what do you think of the middle east peace situation [laughter] 

18.58 20.54 A: oh that sounds great 

25.26 34.05 A: i think it's awful i think it's horrible [laughter] i hate it i hate it and i i wish we were out of there but i guess that's where we should be 

33.88 36.23 B: mhm 

34.69 39.90 A: i don't know i'm i'm really not sure you know every day i change my mind 

40.04 48.11 A: like one day i think we should be out of there the next day i think we're right you know i think we're wrong and i i just keep changing my mind 

44.56 45.78 B: (( mhm )) 

47.45 48.54 B: mhm 

48.65 49.60 A: you know 

49.67 55.22 A: since september eleventh it's like it's ki- i don't know it's 

55.74 58.47 A: it's scary to me and 

57.86 69.64 B: mhm do you think it's different depending on which country is involved i mean i have different opinions for whether it's israel or iraq or afghanistan different parts of the middle east 

68.98 74.21 A: well yeah that's exactly what it is you know it depends on what country and 

74.77 87.88 A: it's just like you know um after a while i just like i keep kind of like tuning it out lately i think i've had like enough of it or something you know i just want to go on with my life 

81.17 82.05 B: mhm 

85.15 86.01 B: uh-huh 

87.36 93.37 B: sure well part of the problem is there's not enough information available that one can tell is correct 

92.72 94.57 A: exactly 

93.57 105.21 B: so when they talk about weapons of mass destruction there has never been anything very conclusive published that one knows i mean certainly colin powell made this claim to the entire united nations 

105.06 109.40 B: and provided some rather persuasive informa- persuasive evidence um 

109.79 117.00 B: on the other hand it's not clear that they have found any ma- weapons yet and i'm not sure how they could find them they were very they would be incredibly easy to hide 

116.81 125.43 B: pieces and take lab equipment apart and hide chemicals i mean they have a whole country to hide them i mean can you imagine trying to find something like that in the united states you'd never find it 

120.22 121.35 A: (( [mn] )) 

124.13 126.48 A: right you wouldn't 

125.88 139.59 B: so i don't know [laughter] i was never sure what the reason was for going into iraq i have the impression that although they never said it they say things like they wanted to get rid of saddam hussein they kept saying there were weapons of mass destruction 

139.46 146.52 B: um [lipsmack] i often think that the reason they wanted to go in was because they were afraid that hussein would destabilize the entire middle east 

146.37 147.66 A: yeah 

147.07 157.31 B: the the weapons he has even though missiles that they found and so forth whatever they did find ah struck me as not poten- posing any danger at all to the united states but i'm sure turkey 

157.16 169.01 B: um should have been really worried [laughter] the local countries should have been really worried about him and ah i i was thinking that was why we went in getting rid of hussein was probably a good thing 

169.44 176.32 A: yeah it was a good thing it was a good thing for the people but i don't know if we are really hitting our target as far as 

176.54 180.32 A: you know i mean this all stems back to september eleventh 

180.00 183.10 B: mhm you mean ter- anti terrorist 

182.28 190.58 A: the anti terrorist and you know i'm not so sure that you know the the ones that are out to really target us 

190.72 198.97 A: aren't able to do a little more make a little more plans because we are somewhere else now concentrating on someone else 

197.59 198.84 B: mhm 

198.91 201.43 B: certainly we're making more enemies for ourselves 

200.92 208.32 A: we certainly are we certainly are and i don't think that's a good thing not you know not in the situation that we are in but 

208.42 214.24 A: i guess when it comes to war you know you always make enemies that's par for the course 

213.96 222.76 B: i'm wondering whether they are going to be able in the aftermath to create environments in the middle east where we can make friends um 

222.67 233.93 B: [laughter] i don't think that they appreciate what we did at all [laughter] i'm not sure they think it was a good thing people don't like to be invaded their country have their countries invaded 

226.26 228.06 A: no no 

228.18 229.22 A: no 

230.08 231.20 A: (( no )) 

233.16 234.97 A: no no 

234.54 235.78 B: um 

235.34 239.45 A: no i'm not so sure that we really did the right thing either i 

239.48 242.03 B: but it doesn't seem like the wrong thing to me 

241.92 249.93 A: yeah that's isn't that see this is this is what i was trying to say but i really don't know how to express it 

242.05 244.31 B: [laughter] 

246.62 248.57 B: yeah yeah 

250.17 252.27 B: i just don't think there's enough information 

251.94 260.32 A: yeah exactly so it does seem like the right thing and it seems like the wrong thing at the same time it's just i can't 

258.76 259.75 B: mhm 

260.60 270.43 A: pinpoint it and then a lot of times when i'm watching the news i start to tune it out because like five minutes ago on another station i heard something else 

270.17 275.51 B: right there's a lot of conflicting opinion lots of conflicting evidence and of course nobody can foresee the future 

275.32 276.42 A: (( right )) 

275.89 279.45 B: there's no way to know what would have happened if they hadn't gone in 

279.00 281.01 A: right right 

279.87 284.87 B: so you are having to compare this it's just sort of like asking somebody do you think you made the right career choice 

284.96 285.89 B: (( ah )) 

285.24 287.29 A: yeah yeah 

285.94 289.12 B: you know did you did you go to the right college who 

288.05 295.47 A: yeah i don't know because they didn't go to the other one too [laughter] 

289.27 290.98 B: (( knows [laughter] )) 

292.64 302.93 B: what would have happened you know should it's very difficult to know something like this because there's not an obvious horrendous disaster yet that makes it clearly wrong at least near term 

299.82 300.85 A: (( mhm )) 

302.62 304.05 A: (( [mn] right )) 

303.42 310.77 B: even if things had gone badly it could still have turned out to be the right thing when somebody from a hundred years from now looks at it will say oh it was a really good thing 

308.94 311.50 A: that's right yeah 

311.41 313.17 B: ah i don't know 

312.86 319.61 A: i don't know either i don't know either i do know that i think i think this is really gonna change the world 

314.76 315.41 B: (( ah )) 

319.62 324.91 A: i think this is going to make a lot of changes i hope for the better i hope not for the worse 

324.61 327.82 B: well technology is making quite a difference 

325.29 326.13 A: but 

327.34 329.78 A: yeah yeah 

329.34 330.72 B: um 

329.95 334.86 A: i just don't know how it's going to affect our children and that's what you know 

333.65 334.90 B: mhm 

335.00 341.33 B: well hopefully they will become friends i mean i notice we have a tremendous number of people from the middle east in this country in the united states 

341.56 343.32 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

341.89 345.15 B: uh in our colleges and and 

345.47 352.05 A: yeah and i and i almost feel sorry for them because a lot of them are being harassed to the point where it's 

352.10 359.62 A: you know it's incredible because these people have been here maybe since they were children they are citizens and a lot of them are 

356.48 358.67 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

359.77 360.89 A: um 

360.94 365.21 A: you know they are almost true americans because they don't know anything else 

364.59 372.22 B: mhm and those are the people we should make friends with and then they can go back and spread the word and act as sort of a bridge between the cultures 

365.29 366.12 A: (( and )) 

366.86 368.45 A: yeah 

371.86 374.08 A: yeah yeah 

373.16 382.05 B: um that would be very nice i mean i don't think we are going to convert anybody in the next hundred years from their position to ours [laughter] 

374.71 375.87 A: yeah 

381.06 387.04 A: no i don't think so [laughter] i don't think so i don't think so 

383.51 385.01 B: (( ah i don't know )) 

385.53 398.83 B: i think the thing that worries me most actually about the war in iraq is all the other countries we neglected in the meantime we have been ignoring afghanistan and mexico and north korea and africa all the countries in africa which it's not a country it's a continent but 

398.75 402.98 B: there are so many things [laughter] they should have been watching at the same time 

402.69 406.86 A: maybe bush intends to do it one at a time [laughter] 

406.16 408.10 B: one at a time that could be 

406.94 408.98 A: [laughter] one at a time 

408.44 410.25 B: well i mean he is certainly 

410.40 423.53 B: burning political bridges with mexico and i think did you see the article in the globe that said that there has never been a third world country that has found a lot of oil reserves that has been able to avoid turning into a 

423.62 427.10 B: country with a corrupt totalitarian government 

426.84 429.29 A: no i didn't see that actually 

427.74 434.93 B: it was funny it's sort of and as far as i know it's true because what happens is those other countries don't develop any other resources or industries 

434.89 445.64 B: and the oil is controlled by the government which makes you know gives them lots of money and no reason to share and the people are satisfied because they have this nice easy lifestyle and so they end up with a a um 

445.65 446.83 B: despotic 

447.27 459.13 B: government and the people just sort of don't mind because they are well taken care of [laughter] and they have no other industry so they have basically very very well to do government and relatively poor populous 

451.83 453.03 A: (( [laughter] )) 

459.18 465.06 B: um because they are not developing other professions and other industries and stuff like that so they are all dependent on the oil [lipsmack] 

465.30 469.28 B: and then everybody bribes everybody to get access to the oil and the money that comes with it 

468.99 470.29 A: yeah 

469.63 479.13 B: so they said that it's really going to be very difficult to create a democracy in iraq or anything approaching a fair government a fair count- a fair community there 

479.26 488.21 B: i thought that that didn't bold well [laughter] so we will see how they are doing that so what did what did most of your friends think 

481.32 482.48 A: no 

483.08 484.75 A: (( oh )) 

488.01 498.68 A: well my friends i think most of them kind of feel the same way i do i think that they just don't know you know they just like go to day and make their opinions day to day 

496.32 497.28 B: (( mhm )) 

498.28 500.21 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

499.02 504.21 A: because as like you said it's really true we just really don't have enough information 

503.29 515.09 B: i know most of the people i work with and the people i know nobody everybody sort of says gee it's hard to know i wish we didn't have to go to war you know it didn't seem right it doesn't seem wrong [laughter] it's just like everybody wanted hussein to go away [mn] 

514.07 521.56 A: yeah yeah you know on a lot of things i can be a very opinionated person and you can't change my mind 

520.62 522.76 B: [laughter] 

521.89 526.30 A: you know if you stuck my head in the mud you couldn't change my mind 

525.25 527.65 B: [laughter] 

526.38 527.31 A: and 

527.32 533.09 A: i can't really form a true opinion on this i just um 

534.06 544.79 A: you know i just keep floating back and forth back and forth back and forth and maybe maybe it's too a little bit of what i want and what i don't want mixed in 

534.55 536.33 B: uh-huh yeah [mn] 

544.58 549.58 B: i think it's because it's actually just hard to know what the right answer is because it isn't a simple question it 

549.36 564.17 B: isn't people weren't being asked would you like to have hussein removed they are being asked what do you think the long term impact will be of having put military people into you know u._s. military into another country and ousted the local government 

563.76 564.80 A: yeah 

563.97 577.56 B: and that's a complicated question it's not like they attacked us in which case people would easily have sort of a right and wrong reaction they'd say oh it's right to defend yourself but you know is it right to go in and remove another country's 

571.62 572.69 A: right 

572.81 575.51 A: right right right 

577.43 586.89 B: um dustmen i don't you know a terribly difficult person is that a is that a good thing especially when the people that haven't invited you to go do it ah 

583.09 584.51 A: right 

585.68 587.84 A: right one of my friends 

587.12 588.62 B: it's hard hard 

588.17 591.80 A: yeah one of my friends kind of feels that um 

591.94 599.90 A: we actually went in there because we could not target the ones that got us from nine eleven
