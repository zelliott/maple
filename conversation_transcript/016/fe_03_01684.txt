9.43 11.34 B: (( uh this is my second one )) 

11.01 17.41 A: this is my second i guess maybe they started it up again and changed the rules a little bit 

12.33 13.17 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

16.91 20.71 B: i'm assuming they did because i got the email a few days ago and i'm like yes 

20.71 22.02 A: yeah i did too 

21.85 23.31 B: (( [sigh] i was so happy )) 

22.07 24.56 A: you don't have to remember your p._i._n. number [laughter] 

24.09 28.68 B: oh i have no idea what my p._i._n. is that's what i was doing look to see if like could find it 

25.84 26.85 A: [laughter] 

28.24 29.26 A: [laughter] 

29.41 32.95 A: [sigh] well i guess we're supposed to talk about the middle east huh 

32.68 35.78 B: uh-huh that's what she said it [laughter] 

35.18 36.73 A: yeah 

35.96 42.82 B: [sigh] okay well i'll [sigh] i really don't know what my opinion is i'm not too sure about the situation over there 

43.04 48.92 A: [sigh] yeah i don't know either i i know i feel bad for those poor people you know what they've lived under and what 

46.62 47.95 B: yeah 

48.95 53.02 A: torture they've gone through and oppression you know 

52.93 57.58 B: i know it and it's just oh i i could not imagine 

57.64 60.20 B: living in a situation like that 

59.39 66.59 A: oh i can't either and yeah th- just the stories that keep coming out about the torture chambers and murders and ugh [sigh] 

67.67 71.28 A: oh i guess my overall opinion would be then that 

72.05 76.64 A: they they've got to be better off down the line you know can't be any worse 

75.05 76.05 B: yeah 

77.07 83.58 B: uh i have to agree with you i mean it it definitely can't be no worse unless they do get someone worse than saddam which 

83.89 85.80 B: hopefully that will not happen 

85.46 93.37 A: yeah let's hope because it looks like new supplies are getting in so they're at least getting food and water and which they didn't even have before 

90.18 91.33 B: right 

93.21 97.56 B: i know i had been keeping up with a lot on the news but the last couple of weeks it was like oh 

97.57 100.64 B: it's the same thing every day i'm tired of watching it 

100.01 109.82 A: yeah sometimes it's too much but my husband told me today there was a story that they found a stash of i don't even know like sixty million or some american dollars 

109.51 111.79 B: oh i hadn't heard anything about that 

111.14 116.80 A: no i hadn't heard he said it was all you know bundled up and it was all u._s. currency 

116.52 125.11 B: well i if i'm not mistaken i'd heard on the news the other day they were going to uh ship plane loads of cash over there for them 

125.39 127.23 A: oh i didn't hear that 

127.33 132.54 B: and then again i could be wrong which would be a real good possibility i'm a stay at home mom with two kids so 

131.83 132.85 A: [laughter] 

132.94 140.00 B: there's a lot i hear and then by the time i think about it again it's only half of what i thought it was [laughter] 

138.86 143.73 A: [laughter] i know what you mean and sometimes it's just too much information 

143.52 144.73 B: right 

143.91 154.66 A: you know you just have to change the subject [laughter] oh yeah i hadn't heard that though i g- i don't know how they're going establish you know currency and a new government and police 

155.07 158.82 B: it's uh and then with all the looting going on over there 

157.88 166.84 A: [mn] oh yeah that's just that's crazy but you know but they do it here when they have riots they tear up their own stores and cities y- you know like in l._a. and things 

165.86 167.04 B: right 

166.85 169.86 A: [sigh] but you know they're destroying their own culture their 

170.22 175.39 A: [sigh] they've destroyed all the shops and [sigh] i just don't understand why 

175.59 177.32 A: [sigh] they went that crazy 

177.31 185.01 B: i mean in a way i suppose i could i mean under after what they've been through and i mean not even being able to do anything without 

186.08 191.14 B: someone coming down on you i mean in a way i guess i could understand that 

190.73 196.34 A: [laughter] okay i can understand destroying you know the government building and the palaces and things 

193.82 195.01 B: right 

195.39 201.76 B: they're probably so happy for the freedom they're not even worried about the long term effect of it 

201.69 202.65 A: (( yeah i )) 

202.10 204.62 B: but that's just my opinion too so [laughter] 

203.57 205.68 A: [laughter] 

205.16 207.34 B: (( and you know what they say about opinions )) 

206.73 211.39 A: (( [laughter] yeah exactly that's one of my favorite sayings [laughter] )) 

207.47 208.88 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] uh yeah and )) 

209.46 210.87 B: (( so i think she said something )) 

212.41 217.71 A: so um i don't know what else did it say um will there ever be peace 

217.85 222.64 B: (( about the u._s. being over there well i think somebody had to do it and i still think they're going to find w- weapons of mass destruction )) 

223.06 230.02 A: (( mm right [sigh] )) 

229.78 235.77 B: somewhere mm and i i i honestly think they'll find saddam eventually i don't think he's dead 

235.92 240.19 A: yeah i'm just i'm torn some of these pictures you see of uh it's not him 

240.54 241.53 A: (( you know )) 

240.55 242.99 B: (( oh and some of them are so obvious )) 

242.33 246.74 A: mhm like a whole extra chin on the one guy and [laughter] 

245.26 246.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

246.92 249.59 B: well it is just so obvious it isn't him 

248.58 252.47 A: you know but i think he was a chicken and he got out 

252.61 257.98 B: i would i would get i would run i would put my tail between my legs and take off 

257.50 260.26 A: course i hate the idea that uh some other country 

260.32 262.52 A: syria maybe is harboring him 

262.11 263.59 B: mm that's true too 

263.35 264.60 A: (( yeah )) 

263.95 267.31 B: but i did hear on the news today that syria was cooperating 

267.70 268.55 A: well 

268.23 270.79 B: [sigh] but i don't know how much truth there is to it 

269.37 272.18 A: iraq said they were cooperating too [laughter] 

270.82 272.24 B: (( sure i know )) 

273.17 286.11 A: and it's unbelievable seeing these mansions that he had and yet his people are starving to death and look what he does and then they found like all the children's supplies and the unicef supplies in the son's palace 

285.98 287.75 B: oh i hadn't heard that 

287.30 295.61 A: yeah it was last week one day one of his sons they found all kinds of school supplies for children unicef packages so he didn't even give things to the kids 

291.93 292.97 B: (( [sigh] i )) 

295.37 297.35 B: mean that's that's just wrong 

296.42 297.31 A: (( [sigh] )) 

297.61 300.95 A: this this is the son that had all the pictures of the naked women 

301.09 304.54 B: what what their name uday and something else 

303.91 305.97 A: yeah i don't remember the other one's name 

305.36 310.72 B: me neither and the only reason i can remember that one's name is because they were talking about how mean he was and everything 

310.19 311.38 A: mhm 

311.68 319.88 A: yeah there was an article on the guy who was kidnapped to be his double and they threatened to kill his sister and mother or something if he didn't do it 

320.61 325.06 B: and i'm sure they would not have h- have hesitated one second to do it 

324.56 326.09 A: oh i'm sure huh 

326.24 329.20 A: but i just [sigh] well i guess
