71.64 79.69 B: i do want u._s. to stay involved because i feel that u._s. was a power and 

79.98 85.30 B: reasoning and everything you know that we have here would be very good 

85.43 86.35 B: (( ah )) 

86.85 93.57 B: you know mean to all i mean they could help to do something about peace in that region 

93.21 94.51 A: right 

93.90 99.33 B: i also know that since war in iraq became you know 

99.53 101.39 B: the way it became 

101.18 102.18 A: mhm 

101.56 106.48 B: um arab countries stopped feeding money to 

106.71 121.08 B: ah palestinian ah terrorism and stopped feeding money to terrorism in chechnya and russia which means that even in that way they held because people can breathe a little bit better in there 

121.74 124.95 B: (( so er you see um we have ah )) 

124.99 136.77 B: certain differences in opinion [laughter] because we are more we are for that war we don't want people to die and certainly civilian to die and 

136.78 143.25 B: even more our you know our people our soldiers to stay you know well as 

143.56 145.29 B: as much as possible 

145.02 146.19 A: (( yeah right )) 

145.44 156.31 B: but we think that it is very hard to be a god and that's what u._s. is trying to do [laughter] you know it is hard but um 

152.73 154.13 A: exactly 

157.14 157.92 A: yeah 

157.30 159.22 B: you know we have 

159.25 165.73 B: books that we grew up with which is ah science fiction that has exactly the same name 

166.31 168.51 B: it is hard to be a god 

168.16 168.96 A: yeah 

168.52 170.34 B: about some 

170.54 180.87 B: hypothetical planet where you know modern people come to help to achieve level of civilization that modern er you know people are in 

181.31 184.62 B: and you know this whole book is basically 

184.65 193.88 B: you know in some way replication of what we see now because people from high civilization and a lot of power and means and 

185.12 185.70 A: (( mhm )) 

193.92 197.30 B: (( you know reason and ah goodwill )) 

197.33 204.42 B: come and try to um impose their point of view and it cannot be easy 

204.21 205.15 A: right 

205.43 208.39 B: so do you want to tell something about it [laughter] 

207.35 208.44 A: (( um you )) 

208.95 211.47 A: know like i said i i'm not 

212.09 217.92 A: sure how to feel because i i am very sceptical about what our own media 

218.58 219.61 B: mhm 

218.84 231.45 A: presents i mean it's it's interesting and it it makes more sense for me to hear about this from someone who has a stake in what goes on over there so 

231.71 234.99 A: listening to you speak 

234.73 235.71 B: mhm 

235.98 238.04 A: makes me feel 

238.95 240.64 A: a little bit better 

240.73 242.69 B: mhm 

241.53 244.58 A: um i don't tr- my only 

245.01 251.48 A: view of what's going on is what i see on the t._v. and i haven't been very happy about what i've seen 

252.32 258.00 A: on the t._v. um i know i have family here who um 

258.02 259.85 A: are originally from 

259.94 265.38 A: israel and they want to go there for their son's bar mitzvah bar mitzvah sorry and 

263.29 264.37 B: mhm 

266.13 269.96 A: it makes me nervous so in a way knowing that 

271.46 276.28 A: with america over there maybe things have a chance of of becoming better 

275.74 276.75 B: mhm 

276.53 277.48 A: makes 

278.50 281.57 A: that good i guess [laughter] i just 

279.96 281.36 B: right right 

282.17 292.63 B: mhm well what i'm worried about is how to go now because i don't believe that it will be quick resolution 

292.13 292.91 A: no 

292.75 305.68 B: and i am really you know thinking of how will we get out of there 'cause to get in is much easier with all this power but to get out and to make certain 

297.98 298.92 A: right 

305.72 316.88 B: ah you know peaceful process to to to have end of it that's what makes me really you know nervous because i don't trust and i don't believe in ability of local 

316.90 325.15 B: you know institutions so whatever they have left to um to to make reasonable progress in a short time at all 

319.99 320.95 A: right 

324.84 325.62 A: yeah 

325.24 334.10 B: [lipsmack] and ah um experience from afghanistan which was that we are immigrants from russia 

334.17 348.69 B: and experience in afghanistan taught us that you know people have different faces during day time and night time in those areas unfortunately and you don't know always that person that you speak during the day 

342.09 342.90 A: mhm 

348.70 355.61 B: and he agree to what he will do during the night time [laughter] when nobody sees and ah 

352.69 353.62 A: right 

355.67 370.57 B: [lipsmack] i believe that um young people who are basically given the task many people who given the task and they're probably very well trained but it's hard to 

370.64 374.98 B: um to understand somebody else 

375.36 376.30 B: um 

376.70 386.27 B: way of thinking if it's totally different from yours you can look at the person and think that you know what they're talking about but they have totally different 

379.74 380.81 A: (( exactly )) 

386.03 386.82 A: (( yeah )) 

387.53 390.50 A: yeah i agree [laughter] 

390.61 395.11 A: i suppose i mean it's also interesting though to hear someone else's viewpoint um 

391.49 394.31 B: (( [mn] )) 

395.54 402.28 A: because you only have your own what you see and what you hear to go by and 

402.13 406.69 B: yeah well which is good that's what we want for our children [laughter] so you know 

404.63 407.18 A: yes yes [laughter] 

406.70 409.93 B: not to be not to be personally touched 

409.69 418.21 A: right you know i don't want i don't want ah america going over there and starting something that they're not going to then 

410.11 411.43 B: but um 

418.88 420.39 A: finish and help 

420.45 427.98 A: i mean they have all these promises they're going to be bringing food and water and all sort of stuff and then i'm seeing on t._v. you know all these people are sitting there looking for food and water 

420.48 421.27 B: mm 

427.96 429.06 B: right 

428.28 434.25 A: i mean i i don't want us going in there and doing something anywhere whether it's iraq whether it's 

434.50 438.18 A: um you know there are other arab countries 

438.58 443.84 A: no matter where it is i don't want them going in there starting something and then leaving it 

444.68 446.47 A: and leaving these people 

446.15 450.06 B: to another dictator [laughter] 

447.43 448.17 A: (( yes )) 

448.90 456.86 A: you know i mean [laughter] and that and that that was my fear and you know i i started 

454.24 455.64 B: (( yeah )) 

457.44 460.20 A: wondering how much what we were hearing 

460.31 466.44 A: was i'm not over there so i have no clue what is really going on other than what i see reported on t._v. and i know 

466.47 471.35 A: from personal experience that not everything that gets reported on t._v. is what's actually going on 

471.61 476.26 A: and or it's half of what's going on and um 

475.38 482.79 B: well i we we talk to them once in a while and we can ask questions like 

482.76 490.43 B: is it a little bit better now than it was let's say months ago is it a little bit better than it was two months ago we have this ability 

487.11 487.82 A: right 

490.77 492.15 B: we have ability to 

492.23 493.40 A: yeah 

492.97 507.44 B: talk to those people it seems that it's a little bit better right now because they don't have to carry their masks around [laughter] but um a lot of things that happen since then on a small scales are not even being reported 

500.05 500.97 A: yeah 

508.06 512.67 B: so you know it's always on a big scale if it's personally touches your life 

512.20 513.05 A: (( yeah right )) 

512.88 522.03 B: and you know in there it seems that a lot of things are very close to them much closer to i mean we've we had it on september eleven 

521.64 522.75 A: yeah 

522.28 528.41 B: and they have it every day and they don't know from which place but it's much smaller scales 

528.19 529.10 A: right 

528.76 535.56 B: but you know what i want only is that yes you have to stay to have a presence 

536.26 547.73 B: to be smart and reasonable and and wise and it's hard and you know i don't know [laughter] because you know i think this country has 

542.95 543.69 A: yeah 

544.32 544.99 A: (( yeah )) 

547.88 551.12 B: has ability to to do something good 

550.94 551.74 A: yeah 

552.25 553.89 A: that i will agree with 

553.56 556.27 B: (( [laughter] )) 

553.95 560.23 A: [laughter] as long as as i say followed through that i will agree with 

559.71 562.23 B: yeah i don't know about that i don't 

561.35 566.55 A: we have a history of of not following through [laughter] 

565.77 570.01 B: yeah well but you know it's always some reason behind that 

569.44 570.32 A: right 

570.47 574.38 B: some political reason that we certainly can't 

574.83 577.07 B: have any effect on 

576.49 577.48 A: yeah 

577.39 579.33 B: okay anything else 

579.80 583.24 A: um i have i mean i know on- 

583.73 586.93 A: one of the questions was do we feel this is something that 

587.08 590.82 A: that has a what peaceful 

591.68 594.61 A: resolution any time soon was that the question 

594.91 599.89 B: ah do you feel that peace will ever be attained i see and what does it
