0.49 2.66 B: hi my name's linda 

2.69 5.06 B: i'm from st angelo texas 

4.73 8.33 A: hi i'm sarah and i'm in milwaukee wisconsin 

8.22 10.16 B: nice to meet you sarah 

9.40 11.03 A: nice to meet you [laughter] 

12.97 22.30 B: i think that we need to stay involved in the middle east until the situation settles out ah [mn] what do you think 

22.13 26.95 A: um i have mixed feelings about it i kind of think that 

28.22 36.24 A: it's important for us to play a role but i worry about charging in and trying to do too much 

36.40 39.55 A: rather than having more of a guidance role 

39.98 43.28 A: in terms of going in with military action and things like that 

43.86 58.33 B: well i think that that um the military action was needed at the time that that we went in i think now we need to have less of um a military stance i think the military still 

58.23 65.91 B: needs to be involved like they are but i don't think that um [mn] 

65.97 69.08 B: we need to to make it 

69.34 83.54 B: make them feel as if we are a military force in the situation i don't think we need to be trying to to be a force of any kind i think we need to let them 

81.25 82.14 A: yeah 

83.56 86.56 B: um make a lot of their own decisions 

86.64 95.71 B: [noise] but there's still a lot of things that that are not resolved yet and and that's where i think our military needs to be there 

86.85 87.76 A: yeah 

90.80 92.10 A: right 

95.41 102.90 A: yeah [mn] yeah i i do think it's important to be letting local people take more of a role 

102.92 105.12 A: in terms of being 

105.19 109.64 A: you know being involved at this point now that we're there but 

110.19 114.97 A: you know really trying to build up and not have us be you know an occupying 

115.03 117.56 A: type force but instead 

118.07 124.19 A: having the u._s. just serve more as providing resources that are needed i guess 

124.10 132.40 B: yup i i agree with that wholeheartedly it it i think it upsets me a little bit that they are already um 

127.16 127.96 A: yeah 

132.40 142.79 B: wanting us out of there um but i think that [noise] um part of that part of the reason may be [noise] because they um 

144.19 150.65 B: they fear ah our intentions and don't really um trust 

150.79 153.68 B: i i think that um they've 

153.74 160.12 B: they've been told so much how bad we are that they they're fearful 

160.42 162.56 B: um you know [mn] 

162.94 167.06 B: to trust us they they're afraid to trust us [mn] 

164.37 165.25 A: right 

166.53 172.34 A: yeah i agree with that i think and i think that's why it's it's good to be 

172.40 180.52 A: you know making it really obvious that you know we're not here to tell you what to do and to take over your country and we're not here just to get your oil or whatever 

177.59 178.60 B: right 

180.24 181.26 B: right 

180.64 185.72 A: the case may be but really showing that we're here to do humanitarian things 

185.81 188.56 A: and to get rid of people who are oppressing you 

188.59 191.29 A: and then to let you have your country back 

191.09 195.99 B: right and i think it's very very important at this point that we ah 

196.00 197.84 B: um we do 

198.05 209.20 B: go on and and help them get the water back on the electricity and all of those things and help them rebuild and for them to realize that that is our purpose there 

208.66 209.49 A: right 

209.38 212.64 B: ah as i think that that we really need to ah 

212.72 216.38 B: to get that that those things started for them [mn] 

216.12 217.45 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

217.19 218.33 B: and ah 

218.40 222.11 B: and really get things going on on that um 

222.26 227.22 B: that note i think they we need to create the trust 

226.59 235.23 A: right yeah [mn] and i think this is a good place where we can start to bring in the u._n. and some of the other countries to try to rebuild 

235.56 238.33 A: some of those bonds with the rest of the world that 

238.53 247.79 A: that had problems over the decision to go to war in the first place and really you know trying to have it be more of a uniting to help 

241.69 242.73 B: mhm 

248.26 250.32 A: them get back on their feet 

250.01 252.42 B: oh i agree i think that ah 

252.55 263.28 B: um i i don't think that that's something that [mn] i know that we're you know one of the major countries in the world as far as advancement and um 

263.67 274.58 B: ah resources but um there are so many others that are just as advanced as us and are much smaller countries that could ah 

272.89 273.65 A: right 

275.35 284.01 B: could go in and offer a whole lot too and i feel i- i'd agree with you i think that they we need to make this a joint effort 

278.17 279.07 A: mhm 

283.53 284.80 A: yeah 

286.67 293.31 A: [mn] so so do you think that things will really ever be peaceful in the middle east at large 

292.45 295.31 B: i don't think so i don't think that we will 

295.35 298.32 B: i don't think that they're a peaceful people 

298.36 299.06 A: (( mm mm )) 

298.54 300.67 B: i think they have um 

301.72 303.51 B: so much um 

305.11 318.66 B: [mn] th- they've got a very different way of life [laughter] and and i feel like um you know i think long before we even went to war i think it was an area that i was afraid to go to 

318.48 329.37 B: simply from stories horror stories of personal of a personal nature that i had heard ah such as how women are treated and how um 

329.69 330.66 B: [mn] um 

331.35 331.91 B: (( [mn] )) 

331.95 334.16 B: they act as if they own 

334.23 336.95 B: um you know a woman or a child 

336.18 336.94 A: right 

337.10 344.73 B: those sort of things i think those are things that that are going to be very very difficult for them to overcome and i don't know that they ever will 

344.58 359.15 A: yeah [mn] yeah i have such mixed feelings about the roles of women in thinking you know that we should go in there and nobody should be allowed to you know force women to cover their faces and not allow women to drive cars and 

359.21 367.05 A: and then at the same time i think but there are women there who are saying well really not being able to drive a car is not a huge deal for me 

366.81 367.64 B: yeah 

367.14 375.11 A: and i can you know do other things and that so is it my place to say well you just don't know how bad you have it 

375.16 376.18 B: right 

375.57 376.53 A: or 

376.57 388.17 A: so i find myself between you know thinking [mn] we have to change this because it's not right and thinking that it's not my place to go in and tell them 

384.31 389.03 B: but yet that's fair right that's their way of life right [mn] 

388.99 400.06 B: yeah you're you're absolutely right you know how do you go in and make someone else change and yet those changes are um part of what keeps them um 

400.17 403.39 B: in a lot of turmoil because 

402.59 403.68 A: yeah 

403.52 409.43 B: um [lipsmack] groups different groups such as women ah um 

409.49 415.10 B: th- that's the one that o- obviously comes to comes to mind the most um 

413.38 414.19 A: yeah 

416.21 424.21 B: they they see the way the rest of the world reacts and um not just reacts but 

424.31 438.58 B: gets to act um in their own countries and um it creates an unrest for them so i feel like you know there's there's just a lot of issues there that that i don't know that they can overcome 

431.54 432.41 A: yeah 

438.29 441.32 A: yeah or it's definitely going to take a lot 

440.88 442.25 B: yeah 

441.58 444.06 A: well and i also think that being 

445.33 459.37 A: in countries where the government is based on a religious group and everybody in the country's not from that religious group that that's definitely a basis for lots of the unrest 

454.64 455.63 B: mhm 

458.98 460.14 B: agreed 

459.54 462.14 A: and that you know if you're going to 

462.42 467.62 A: going to base your government on your moral beliefs and things like that 

467.66 471.59 A: then you're definitely going to have people disagreeing with you 

471.94 473.29 B: mhm 

473.12 474.17 A: so 

474.35 476.36 A: yeah i've just in hearing 

475.17 478.39 B: so that'll cau- it'll cause unrest also right 

477.50 488.80 A: yeah yeah just hearing in the past few days how in iraq they're talking about wanting to set up a new muslim government and where does that leave anybody who's not 

485.74 486.61 B: yeah 

488.60 491.00 B: yeah but who isn't muslim right 

490.26 498.28 A: right i mean and i guess there are some countries like turkey is a muslim country but has a sec- secular government 

497.66 499.06 B: mhm 

498.41 501.16 A: and so that's possible 

501.46 506.77 B: oh yeah i i guess it is but like you say ah you know i 

507.50 508.32 B: (( they're )) 

508.37 509.97 B: and and of course 

510.04 513.71 B: [mn] so many factors go into um how 

514.35 526.16 B: a a country is um um what their resources are and everything else you know they're such a um a desert country that um 

524.20 525.16 A: yeah 

526.48 536.37 B: they've got a lot of o- of issues that they have to face every day that we don't know anything about that we can't [mn] fathom 

534.46 535.38 A: yeah 

536.04 537.11 A: mhm 

537.38 547.79 B: and i- you know it- it's it's very difficult for someone sitting over here to make judgments upon them just as it would be very difficult for them to sit over there and say well 

542.79 543.59 A: right 

547.67 560.01 B: ah you know the united states is such a rich country and yet w- you know we have our own problems right here at home so um you know in different areas in different ways um 

554.45 555.28 A: right 

559.29 560.59 A: yeah 

560.02 570.58 B: whether it be the jobs in different areas joblessness or whether it be um a water problem in different areas or whatever it might be we have our 

563.74 564.70 A: mhm 

568.95 569.83 A: yeah 

570.45 577.68 B: our own ah kind of problems that we have to deal with as and we have to deal with them as a people and as a nation 

577.43 578.50 A: yeah 

577.88 579.44 B: and um 

579.45 582.61 B: [mn] we know ourselves 

583.13 590.56 B: [mn] how hard it is to keep that fine line between religion and government [laughter] 

589.74 591.33 A: right yeah 

590.45 599.89 B: because right here in this country we are fighting our own battle over that you know still [mn] um and so i feel like you know they 

595.41 596.18 A: (( right ))
