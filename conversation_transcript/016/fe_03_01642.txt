0.25 2.09 A: hello hi 

0.53 2.51 B: hi hi 

2.32 6.03 A: this is my first one so you'll have to bear with me oh good 

5.57 7.87 B: me too this is my first one also so 

6.78 8.85 A: [laughter] 

8.21 9.98 B: we're both newbies 

9.39 11.12 A: my name is maryanne 

11.18 12.78 B: hi i'm kwanisha 

11.81 14.80 A: [noise] and i'm from massachusetts good 

14.57 18.97 B: um i'm from new york i mean i'm from new york but i go to school in pennsylvania 

18.67 19.75 A: (( for you )) 

19.59 20.94 B: thank you 

20.36 24.28 A: so the topic is the middle east and you can go ahead [mn] 

22.23 23.16 B: yeah 

24.59 29.20 B: [lipsmack] well i guess they asked us if we think that there should be peace in the middle east or the 

28.51 29.41 A: right 

29.17 34.21 B: u._s. should be involved and i personally think that we have no place there i think that something 

34.15 44.63 B: that the people sort it out with themselves and that we should learn from history and us always getting involved and putting in proper governments usually that don't work out in the long run and i really don't think 

44.63 52.62 B: um i think one bush is using this and the whole nine eleven incident as a way to kind of go in there and i really think it's all about oil 

44.88 45.99 A: [noise] 

51.30 52.37 A: [noise] 

52.53 64.52 B: or some other reason some other economic reason i don't really think it's for i don't think he really cares about the people there and the way the government system is working so i think that we should mind our own business [laughter] 'cause no one asked us to be there a 

64.34 73.49 B: lot of people are definitely against it and as you see there's a lot of antiwar sentiment in the country itself [noise] so we bush shouldn't act like a tyrant in the first place 

73.38 79.99 B: and we should just really [mn] keep our place in the united states and worry about more domestic problems than anything else 

80.03 85.31 A: [mn] you know i have to tell you when i heard the topic i was a little concerned because ah [mn] 

85.70 88.10 A: i i i feel exactly as you do 

88.23 93.56 A: and i i feel that it's it's not popular to speak out 

93.42 94.34 B: mhm 

93.71 99.00 A: about it so y- you know i- i'm probably a little older than you are [mn] 

94.88 95.83 B: yeah 

99.03 99.92 B: mhm 

99.27 110.93 A: and ah so i kinda keep my opinions to myself when people talk about it i kind just go yeah i feel exactly i have it has to do with israel it has to with the oil 

110.85 122.09 A: they're not going to find any weapons of mass destruction he he kind has [mn] glossed over that part of it that we just wanted to take them over 

113.00 113.93 B: mhm 

122.18 123.17 B: yeah 

122.49 130.80 A: not in in [mn] there's many other people that a- are tyrants in other countries and he hasn't done a thing about those 

131.60 137.05 B: and like where's it our place to go around like this is on it the whole globalization issue 

136.40 137.36 A: right 

137.00 147.72 B: and all that like where is it our place you know to go around to other countries like okay we don't like your your um leader so we're gonna get rid of him [laughter] you know let's go 

143.59 144.75 A: right 

145.32 149.99 A: i agree completely and this is shocking to me [laughter] 

148.98 151.64 B: and you know and you know i understand like 

151.75 160.64 B: like i i still wasn't for it but the whole afghanistan thing and the whole you know all that stuff where like you know they attacked our country so we want to attack theirs 

160.44 161.17 A: mm 

160.63 171.14 B: that i guess is easier [lipsmack] i still don't agree with it but it's easier to um i guess rationalize like okay we're looking for al qaeda we're trying to find you know 

165.79 166.60 A: right 

171.00 178.75 B: all that stuff and you know we're gonna we want to get them back whatever like that you know like they took down our trade center [noise] they attacked us whatever like that but to go on this 

178.75 183.95 B: kind of global anti terrorist like let's get all the terrorists out out of the country like 

180.13 181.03 A: right 

183.48 184.43 A: right 

183.83 190.67 B: that's not right and we also have weapons of mass destruction but i guess we're gonna it for good use and they wouldn't use it for good use 

186.76 189.62 A: i know [laughter] 

190.19 191.10 A: right 

190.50 202.69 B: so it's like wh- like you know if if anything other countries england could be like you know what we're gonna attack the united states because have global weapons and they might use it on iraq and they might destroy that portion of the country i mean of the world so 

198.24 199.05 A: right 

202.48 213.19 B: let's you know come and bomb america like you know it can work both ways and a lot of times it don't is because like [mn] i guess you could say we have more political um slash economic power 

204.47 205.43 A: right 

213.12 218.59 B: in that sense and i i think we just wanna bully these smaller nations and i i think he's just really trying to get like 

218.74 223.72 B: payback daddy [laughter] he'd like this or whatever like that i it's really 

220.23 222.29 A: oh i agree with you completely 

222.38 225.99 A: his father messed it up by not taking him out ten years ago 

225.81 226.78 B: mhm 

226.19 231.85 A: [noise] and now he's gonna he's trying to do it but they're gonna leave the whole country in turmoil there is no one 

231.96 234.20 A: they don't have a leader to take it over [noise] 

234.22 237.88 B: yeah and then especially with limited media coverage 

237.31 238.42 A: right 

237.81 249.22 B: and those kind of things like americans really don't see what's going on i think it was like what vietnam ah where you had life magazine and the media really there like look look what we're doing to these people so 

241.19 242.02 A: (( mm )) 

246.76 247.65 A: right 

247.96 248.81 A: yeah 

249.01 259.89 B: there was a outcry even from our people like you know we need to stop there's no reason for this no reason but now they're like it seems like that's the only part they learned from history like oh we can't let the people know what's going on 

251.55 252.36 A: yeah 

253.12 254.01 A: yeah 

259.90 273.00 B: because then you know they'll see that we're wrong they'll see that we're making a mistake and they'll see that there's no reason for this to be occurring and they'll like you know but i think that already there's a lot of antiwar sentiment the only thing is i think the more like 

273.03 281.54 B: the people that i see that's really out there marching are like are the college students [laughter] but it and like i don't think until a lot of adults 

274.51 275.34 A: (( yeah )) 

277.34 278.56 A: right 

281.40 289.60 B: and people who are in um these corporate corporations who have like i guess you could say a larger public voice come out and speak against it 

287.84 288.82 A: right 

289.38 297.17 B: nothing's really going to happen i mean a lot of celebrities are speaking out against it but i think they're still trying to disregard them it's like oh they're celebrities whatever whatever like 

296.43 300.34 A: like they don't have a voice that they shouldn't ah voice their own opinions 

300.18 301.29 B: yeah 

300.72 308.96 A: everybody should be able to ah ah i really don't i have to say that because i just i don't want to get in- into it with people 

308.83 309.89 B: mhm 

309.26 310.52 A: (( but ah [mn] )) 

310.60 316.48 A: i was totally against 'em going in my future son in law is in the marines and um 

315.47 316.27 B: mhm 

316.73 325.88 A: [lipsmack] it's kind a me- messing up my daughter's wedding and um [mn] i just wish all these guys could just come home be with their families and 

325.89 333.63 A: raise their kids and have a happy life and not ah try to be the policemen for the world [mn] 

332.98 334.02 B: mhm 

334.20 336.55 B: and another thing i believe is that 

336.60 340.36 B: [lipsmack] i think the way they set up the whole thing like the whole 

340.23 346.25 B: war thing like the you either with us or against us i mean that that strategy is so f- 

341.01 342.04 A: (( mhm )) 

342.89 343.83 A: right 

346.10 349.37 B: i mean that just shows how a big bully h- he is it's like 

348.42 349.38 A: right 

349.19 354.37 B: there's no he's not he's leaving no room for like a healthy opposition 

354.17 364.91 B: like 'cause i think no matter what you do or not matter like what type of leader you are you always have to understand that there are always going to be whether it be a minority or a majority that there's going to be people who don't agree with you 

354.88 355.70 A: right 

364.33 365.55 A: absolutely 

364.78 371.35 B: and he's setting it up that whoever doesn't agree they're gonna feel like they're anti-american like 

371.35 385.23 B: anti they oh like not antiterrorist but they're pro-terrorist and like all this kind of thing like that and you know even with all these antiwar rallies and you know you have 'em on the east coast and the west coast and all the things but mostly what (( )) and the walk in 

375.26 376.09 A: right 

385.10 386.47 B: (( wa- um [mn] )) 

386.57 388.49 B: and the walk in d._c. 

388.32 393.58 B: um he's still like okay thank you i hear your voice but um we're still gonna go on with the war it's like [laughter] 

393.39 406.04 B: he- he's like really disregarding like the people who are actually out there protesting at when they're like you know the capital and things like that he's not really paying attention to us and think the thing that really really disturbed me [lipsmack] 

397.12 398.03 A: right 

406.08 410.20 B: was i was listening to m._p._r. the day that the first bombing 

410.13 416.07 B: and it was like um yeah you know president bush was inside and he was waving his fist in the air 

410.21 411.03 A: (( ah )) 

415.55 416.47 A: right 

415.92 421.43 B: and he's really he's really confident about this decision for war i'm like how could anyone ever say 

421.27 436.12 B: that they're confident about a decision to go to war if anything that should always be a last option after negotiations i don't think anyone will ever feel comfortable with going to war it should be like okay i have to do this because there's nothing else to do 

424.12 425.08 A: right 

435.66 436.60 A: (( right [noise] )) 

435.95 445.04 B: but i still feel like i really wish that we could have done more like i wanted like to to even that picture in my head of him going around celebrating this means that 

443.94 444.84 A: right 

444.85 452.39 B: you know y- you don't feel like there's a consequence to this like millions of people i mean not millions but i mean thousands of men or hundreds 

450.11 450.90 A: right 

452.25 460.69 B: are going to die like people who belong to this country and i think you know maybe that's not hitting him because his children are not you know his daughters are not 

459.38 461.28 A: his daughters would never go 

461.19 474.94 B: you know it's not his daughters and it's not the congressmen's um sons and daughters who are probably in college or in occupations where they wouldn't even if they were say to reinforce the draft that they wouldn't even have to go 

464.09 464.92 A: right 

474.95 475.78 A: right 

475.21 481.40 B: you know ah um to iraq or whatever other country he's thinking about going to next you know so like 

481.50 484.96 B: really they have this comfort and the security 

484.77 497.84 B: that you know they don't have to worry about this so they're like okay yeah let's go to war i'm just like you're war mongers out there they don't see how it affects you know people of color people pov- like people near the poverty line 'cause these are people who will will 

497.73 509.70 B: either be drafted if there is a draft or have to go off to war or whose only option is military service for you know a set income and benefits for their family and you know these are individuals who are going to war and i just think like 

499.73 500.52 A: right 

505.45 506.17 A: mm 

509.63 521.38 B: no one like those who would think about it but the people who actually make these decisions and the congressmen don't really see how it influences maybe the [mn] you could say the lower tiers of american society economically 

518.97 519.77 A: right 

519.93 521.22 A: absolutely 

521.73 524.47 A: [noise] [mn] you can see them some of them are so young 

524.71 529.86 A: and they're they're really i think they just joined up to try to get an education out of it 

529.38 531.81 B: yeah yeah 'cause you get the education from it 

530.26 532.64 A: on- once their four years are over 

532.89 543.46 B: yeah even i like and i go like i go to an ivy league college i go to university of penn i was like [mn] before this all this happened i was like maybe i should join r._o._t._c. they'll help me like pay for my education because 

542.55 543.67 A: (( right [noise] )) 

543.64 552.24 B: like to go to a good college there's the tuition it's forty thousand dollars like a year and like every year the tuition rises and rises and rises due to inflation 

547.11 547.92 A: right 

550.00 551.09 A: of course 

552.06 561.41 B: so like those little programs like that were like you say you can say maybe eighteen to twenty four year olds are joining r._o._t._c. or going into the reserves just for the 

560.66 562.01 A: right 

561.42 572.92 B: extra educational benefits like even some of the health benefits they give full medical coverage dental coverage and your family gets insurance so that if you're married and things like that so people marry young and those things like that 

566.75 567.73 A: right 

572.78 576.58 B: so but even the p._o._w.s that came back 

576.68 579.77 B: i was like wow he looks like he's sixteen like [laughter] 

579.13 581.12 A: [laughter] 

580.39 583.11 B: how did well i know he's not sixteen 

581.27 583.71 A: they looked like young boys 

583.17 588.03 B: like so he must be eighteen 'cause you have to be at least eighteen to go over to the war and i'm just like wow like 

585.01 587.40 A: right you have to be eighteen right 

588.02 599.89 B: and i and i'm just thinking about you know all the homeless people i see in the street and like not all are veterans but some of them are and i'm just like thinking like you know you ones who are what eighteen like you've probably seen things that you know no one at ho 

594.25 595.34 A: right
