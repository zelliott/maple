21.43 23.21 A: (( so ah )) 

22.67 24.58 B: i don't know i disagree with 

26.18 26.96 B: it 

27.31 32.80 A: yeah i i i pretty much myself as well it's funny though i did get a um 

33.04 38.13 A: an email this morning from a family friend she's actually a a pilot in the for the marines 

38.07 39.32 B: oh wow [noise] 

38.71 40.05 A: and she had a 

40.20 53.26 A: really long email pretty interesting account of of a lot of the runs that she was doing and she had this one account where this one soldier came up and thanked her apparently they were pinned down in one area and they 

53.54 55.36 A: and they managed to ah 

55.55 61.95 A: i mean they they she essentially dropped a bomb on this shack where they're being fired from 

62.04 63.15 B: wow 

62.55 63.73 A: [noise] and um 

64.68 68.78 A: you know so it's kind of it's it's a tough call you know between the troops 

67.38 75.39 B: it is just you know i mean you don't want to not i mean the people that are doing that you know are putting their lives at risk and stuff you have to respect that 

75.15 82.22 A: yeah yeah so it's tough you know to at least for for myself i i don't really support bush but it seems 

81.42 87.15 B: bush on the other hand i have no respect for [laughter] you don't have to respect him [laughter] 

84.05 86.07 A: [laughter] 

86.55 90.22 A: right on yeah it's funny we we call him shrub 

90.26 95.51 B: yeah i think a lot of people are calling that's one of the nicer things i hear him called [laughter] 

96.59 104.98 A: so um let's see what else what in regards to ah peace do you ever think it will end up happening in the middle east 

105.64 111.63 B: i don't know it's a pretty scary situation you know i don't know that how much people in the middle east really want it it's 

112.80 115.84 A: can you hear that noise in the background 

116.29 117.72 B: a fuzzy noise 

117.58 119.63 A: okay i'm not sure 

119.69 121.01 A: um 

121.40 125.20 A: yeah it is a pretty interesting situation i'm not sure that um 

126.29 128.42 A: i'm not sure that 

128.46 133.99 A: it's gonna take someth- i i guess um the israeli palestinian conflict is is a bit more 

134.13 135.39 B: yeah i mean i 

134.73 137.99 A: in depth i'm not sure that's ever gonna be resolved 

137.44 140.05 B: mean you could one would always hope for peace 

140.07 144.89 B: and a happy resolution but the way things are going now i just don't see it headed that way 

145.09 148.11 A: i think i think the israelis would have to give back 

148.65 153.90 A: the palestinian lands to palestinians and um it's funny 

151.97 155.86 B: if they ever want to have peace i think that's the only way that it will ever happen 

155.63 158.15 A: yeah because that 

156.60 159.12 B: they're not gonna just go away [laughter] 

158.67 163.83 A: it's it's almost as if the palestinians don't have anything to lose at this point i mean if you don't 

162.93 165.35 B: well they've locked everything already 

165.05 170.00 A: right it's funny how the u._s. hasn't in- intervened on that situation yet 

169.91 172.64 B: well there's no money in it for us you know 

172.53 178.16 A: yeah well i i there's quite a bit of it the israeli lobby 

178.19 179.24 B: that too 

179.76 180.64 A: um 

182.40 184.85 A: and 

182.55 183.52 B: definitely 

184.86 185.79 A: so 

185.83 188.05 A: which part of the country are you from 

187.67 190.16 B: um i live just outside seattle 

189.98 192.16 A: (( oh okay so do we so do i )) 

192.21 193.61 B: oh yeah 

192.99 198.68 A: yeah that's probably that's probably why we have similar opinions [laughter] 

197.29 201.59 B: could be not exactly your most ah right wing area 

201.44 209.79 A: no it's it's odd to listen to those opinion polls in regards to the whole war and the middle east it doesn't seem like um 

210.73 211.98 A: (( that ah )) 

212.71 224.93 A: yeah it doesn't seem that like that could actually be true you know say like eighty seventy per cent of the people support the war and you know what does that mean no one ever gives any statistics 

217.38 218.30 B: yeah 

224.42 228.34 B: i don't know but people of the people i know it's not seventy per cent [laughter] it's 

229.35 232.03 B: kind of strange i guess it depends on where you are 

232.34 233.11 A: mhm 

232.48 233.52 B: you know 

234.33 237.92 B: although i have a lot of relatives in texas and they're they're very behind bush 

238.34 239.96 A: they're very what 

239.32 241.40 B: they're very behind bush they love him 

241.42 243.53 A: oh that's scary 

243.30 247.08 B: i try to [laughter] try to talk to them [laughter] 

247.04 250.71 A: you don't want to ru- ruin your relationship with them 

249.33 254.44 B: exactly it's like oh merry christmas [laughter] let's not talk about anything else 

256.93 258.06 A: um 

258.38 262.77 A: interesting so so you wouldn't vote for bush 

262.58 269.43 B: oh i yeah definitely not i did not vote for him would not vote for him couldn't have voted for his dad [laughter] 

263.57 266.19 A: [laughter] did you 

266.73 267.88 A: did you vote for 

269.17 270.85 A: did you vote for nader 

271.67 279.13 B: no i didn't vote for nader because i kind of felt like he split the vote of ah other side and made it so that 

279.33 283.35 B: there's no way that gore could win although gore's an idiot too [laughter] 

283.61 286.27 A: yeah 

284.69 288.01 B: i just didn't think we didn't have a very good opponent you know 

288.67 295.77 A: yeah it wa- i i voted for nader and i don't i wouldn't do it again at the presidential level just because um 

296.09 300.53 A: i think there was a lot of talk about how the two were 

300.93 302.17 A: um 

303.33 311.31 A: ah so there wasn't much difference between gore and bush but i think that there bush is really really a whole lot worse [laughter] 

310.35 314.12 B: i i don't think that gore would have had us a war like this 

314.49 317.51 B: over the middle east i don't think he would have handled the whole 

317.56 319.58 B: september eleven thing the same way 

319.85 325.35 A: yeah yeah the p- patriot act and the whole dep- department of homeland security 

323.30 334.86 B: i mean especially i don't actually want people to be able to bug my phone without my permission for no reason you know i actually thought my civil liberties were important but i guess you know [laughter] i guess i was mistaken 

334.81 336.66 A: yeah 

334.95 335.58 B: (( it's )) 

337.31 338.62 A: and so 

337.55 339.63 B: still still disturbing to me 

339.48 342.54 A: so do you know anyone whose been sent over to the middle east 

342.60 345.78 B: um no actually all my friends are you know 

345.94 350.68 B: older i'm thirty but most of the people i know are you know they're too old to be drafted and 

351.92 355.90 A: mhm so what about any do you have any friends from the middle east 

352.61 354.63 B: have kids and 

356.40 362.42 B: um i have in new york i have a lot of friends who are ah arabic not around here i don't know any arabic people 

362.22 362.99 A: mhm 

363.09 366.30 B: pretty i don't know maybe because i live on the east side you know 

367.82 372.35 A: well i work at the university and um th- there are quite a few 

370.66 371.43 B: oh 

372.77 382.78 A: um people here there's a turkish girl i work with and she was saying that all the turkish men between the ages of like seventeen and like thirty five have had to register with 

383.80 386.48 A: with ah the i._n._s. 

386.30 396.41 B: well see i mean that to me i mean that's totally not right you know i mean what because you're turkish you're you know i mean are we going to start putting them in camps like we did with the japanese in world war two i mean 

396.46 398.68 A: well th- a lot of them have been 

399.72 404.07 A: i guess i mean her concern is a lot of them 

404.16 411.42 A: have been called on [noise] specific ah like violations or you know they are just paying a lot more attention to 

411.83 415.34 A: their immigrant status and um 

414.64 418.93 B: see i mean i think that's not really fair i mean it's not it's it would be one thing if if 

419.09 424.19 B: they have some reason to investigate people but just to do it just for the sake of doing it you know 

423.95 431.17 A: yeah i wonder if they actually get anything out of it or if it's just sort of a front to try to cover their bases so they can tell people they're 

431.19 433.01 A: investigating 

433.90 439.57 A: terrorist activities which is ki- now it's been the sort of defensive catch phrase to 

439.64 441.20 A: allow people to 

442.18 443.31 A: to ah 

443.94 445.62 A: you know essentially it's 

446.98 455.46 A: you know like in the name of terrorism now you can get away with anything it's just sort of what israel has been doing 

454.78 455.66 B: hello 

456.76 457.98 A: i'm sorry 

457.96 459.09 B: oh sorry
