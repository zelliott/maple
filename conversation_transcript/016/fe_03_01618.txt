20.17 25.71 B: okay are we talking about the war or uh the problems with israel and palestine 

25.46 32.23 A: i think it's um both i mean they said um one of the questions was do you feel like peace will ever be obtained

39.59 45.11 A: um with the whole war how like are you comfortable with the decisions that bush has made 

45.52 49.33 B: um i am i'm sorry we had to go to war but um 

49.46 50.41 B: i think we 

50.46 59.43 B: had to [laughter] um i think we've established ourselves as uh the power now pretty much [sigh] in the world um 

51.80 52.62 A: (( mm uh-huh )) 

59.79 67.34 B: and we'll get respect i think from other countries although i'm disappointed that we haven't from canada and um 

66.58 67.47 A: mhm 

69.26 70.35 B: the french 

70.58 72.24 B: countries and uh 

74.66 75.48 B: (( the )) 

75.83 78.48 B: [laughter] uh russia 

75.94 76.69 A: (( [mn] )) 

77.45 83.97 A: i yeah see i don't really understand why we're at war like i honestly don't know what we're gonna get out of it like 

84.71 91.76 B: we're acting like we're giving more um i mean we- we're liberating people that have been oppressed and um 

92.41 95.03 B: and it's gonna be hard i mean i don't know that we're 

95.82 96.77 B: (( um )) 

97.07 103.83 B: we're i think we're uh seen as you know the savior [laughter] to the world and and so we're 

104.51 106.51 B: we're stopping a um 

107.05 109.28 B: maniac from killing 

109.56 111.10 B: uh his people 

111.72 118.69 A: true but who are we to say like that they're uncomfortable or they're not happy with their current situation 

119.56 121.44 B: who are we to say that 

121.04 127.35 A: yeah 'cause i mean we're going in there and bush's whole thing is he want to liberate and it seems like he wants to create a democracy but 

127.52 137.19 A: in the middle east it doesn't seem like democracy could ever be something that would thrive just because their basis is so strong in religion 

137.35 146.15 B: yeah i that's one thing i i wonder about i've been to um egypt i was there for three weeks and i've also been to um 

137.47 138.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

146.28 148.47 B: jerusalem uh several 

148.56 150.16 B: cities in um 

151.99 154.32 B: i've got a brain cloud [laughter] 

153.78 154.65 A: (( [sigh] )) 

154.35 160.58 B: right now but in israel and um and i've seen the way people live 

156.72 157.52 A: okay 

160.57 161.78 A: mhm 

161.15 163.09 B: in egypt um 

166.26 177.38 B: and yeah and i've seen ev- even this is like twenty years ago that i was there or fifteen and and they were hating each other then uh the palestinians and um 

172.31 173.34 A: mhm 

174.61 175.66 A: yeah 

177.92 179.90 B: the jewish people um 

179.86 183.63 A: that's the thing like it seems like it's so deeply rooted like 

183.84 192.47 A: in the way they think in the way they live their lives that i don't think by us intervening that it's gonna change any of the hostility towards each other 

192.33 202.77 B: yeah i don't understand why they uh just because somebody's religion is different why you have to hate that person i think all religions are good you know as long as y- uh i think they make people 

202.93 205.18 B: more civilized and you know more 

206.56 209.81 B: make people better people and i just don't see 

211.17 218.54 B: you know hating somebody because of their religion or because they have different beliefs i mean can you understand that [laughter] 

217.66 219.76 A: mm i really can't i mean 

219.92 226.02 A: i i i just i really don't understand why they can't like save themselves if it has to come down to that you know 

226.16 232.67 A: like why does there have to be any kind of like intervention between the two um countries you know 

226.21 227.05 B: yeah 

233.88 235.55 B: yeah i i 

236.05 239.71 B: i think you know what they're gonna attempt to do is to get 

240.58 245.27 B: well they're gonna get 'em [sigh] to try not to have that kind of um 

247.05 249.64 B: you know hate hate the different sects 

250.35 251.67 A: yeah 

250.97 256.74 B: sects of the religion you know the sheiks and the baath party and all the different uh 

258.24 263.65 A: like when you think about it there's so many people there that believe in what saddam hussein is doing and 

263.76 266.93 A: have such a respect for that for him so that 

266.98 273.25 A: what it seems like even when this war is over if it ever does finish that um 

273.85 278.56 A: i think people'll just go back to having a sort of like dictatorship because i don't think they 

278.31 285.36 B: well that's why the united states well that's why the united states is intervening um and they have people over there to 

278.71 280.54 A: will embrace anything else 

285.64 289.31 B: and they're gonna get people from you have to understand that 

289.51 290.53 B: um 

292.10 295.36 B: i don't know if you've ever been to any of the arab countries but they 

294.58 296.16 A: (( mm mm no i haven't )) 

295.71 300.09 B: they [sigh] it's just unreal the way they live when i was in egypt 

300.28 304.05 B: um well they were muslim you know they are too 

302.94 303.74 A: mhm 

304.24 305.37 B: and 

306.81 309.61 B: but it's a very backwards you know 

311.18 313.27 B: society i mean you know they just 

313.74 327.80 B: they still you know ride donkeys and carry [laughter] when i was there it was like uh i really was reminded of um bible school and sunday school when i was a child you know and all the pictures and the and the books uh 

316.59 317.66 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

328.19 339.12 B: that showed the um donkeys and you know the women carrying the food on their heads and all that that and it was really like that and the people lived in caves i mean i was amazed but that's the way 

340.40 341.65 A: huh well 

340.55 345.71 B: that's the way they lived and uh you know dirt roads sand so i 

346.63 349.75 B: was you know things have advanced but 

350.53 351.47 B: um 

352.07 356.68 B: i think if they believe in believed in saddam hussein 

356.85 366.96 B: although i don't think they r- that many of 'em did i think they did because they had to because he was a dictator i'm i just hope you know that's all anybody can do is just hope that um 

361.45 362.53 A: mhm 

368.72 372.91 B: you know that they can live together like like we do and you know with the different 

374.64 375.84 B: divisions 

376.01 381.50 B: in the religions it's like they would have one basic belief i mean they all believe in allah [sigh] 

377.12 378.04 A: mhm 

381.40 382.72 A: yeah true 

381.80 386.28 B: um but yeah it's like you know in england uh 

386.49 393.91 B: i never have understood all the conflict there but it's still there still is some between the catholics and the protestants [laughter] 

393.10 394.81 A: yeah that's very true 

394.84 397.58 B: and and they're certainly i would think 

398.27 402.94 B: you know people that are educated and [sigh] know better [sigh] but 

402.32 403.28 A: (( right )) 

404.01 407.08 B: i think the united states is just more 

408.08 409.09 B: um 

409.13 411.82 B: we're a more sophisticated society 

411.83 413.03 B: and 

414.32 415.14 B: um 

415.03 427.08 A: i mean i don't think there's anything wrong with that like i think in order for the world to go around you need some societies that are a little bit more advanced than others you know kinda like give and take and that's what makes the world go around 

422.98 424.31 B: yeah right 

427.18 429.38 A: i just don't understand 

429.90 437.85 A: like what the outcome is gonna be of this war like i understand what why they're going there but i don't really see it happening you know 

437.92 445.11 A: i just think we're kinda like blindly going in and targeting a man just because he's the easiest target right now 

445.45 451.35 B: oh i don't think that i think you know how many eight hundred thousand people he killed 

451.57 455.21 B: uh i think we're i i don't understand why he wouldn't 

455.98 465.98 B: cooperate with the um u._n. i don't i don't understand that it's almost like he has a death wish or something or maybe he was just gonna dare us you know and didn't think it would ever happen 

466.01 466.97 B: (( it's just )) 

467.68 473.86 B: i think you know there was the dare he he apparently did just and maybe and 

473.96 476.77 B: maybe he didn't think we would act i don't know 

476.91 477.79 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

479.14 484.51 A: so then in that case like why aren't we going after like north korea if we're gonna be consistent with the 

483.76 487.92 B: well well they're they're gonna have talks with them um 

488.66 491.57 B: lord i hope we don't have to go after them 

491.35 492.49 A: [laughter] 

491.83 499.03 B: [laughter] oh but i i think we have established supremacy you know um 

492.79 494.20 A: (( i know )) 

499.91 501.81 B: by the way we've taken 

502.15 503.01 B: um 

504.12 505.16 B: iraq 

504.30 509.76 A: well that's true and they i mean it's obvious that they're threatened by that and they don't want to um 

510.21 516.00 A: acknowledge that so i think that's where the stubbornness comes in on saddam hussein's part 

511.41 512.31 B: (( right right )) 

516.85 524.22 B: yeah that's men you know [laughter] if he wasn't a man he just [laughter] i don't know i i think my husband would um [sigh] 

518.57 519.83 A: [laughter] 

524.51 526.53 B: acquiesce before he would 

527.32 529.36 B: you know be killed [sigh] 

528.76 529.99 A: mhm 

530.30 531.95 A: but when you think about it i mean 

532.47 534.51 A: everything that they do is 

534.62 538.73 A: you know based on allah and everything happens for a reason 

538.74 551.57 A: so like they're not gonna just back down because some political power is saying so you know 'cause to them there's something there's something much more than just international relations and that's you know religion 

551.23 552.97 B: yeah that that when you 

553.18 555.79 B: play that into it um 

554.51 555.51 A: mhm 

556.27 562.80 B: that you know i think catholics in rome and all they they uh i don't know if you're catholic or you [sigh] 

562.61 564.16 A: yeah i'm catholic 

563.48 567.01 B: oh are y- well but th- you know they seem to be 

567.82 571.92 B: ruled by the pope pretty much uh i would never want um 

570.12 570.79 A: mm 

572.16 573.34 B: religious 

573.37 576.25 B: beliefs to dictate you know whether i was gonna 

576.70 581.43 B: abort a child or not or you know if i was raped i i just you know i guess they 

580.90 582.04 A: yeah 

582.83 585.79 A: but i think those are technicalities that come into play 

585.51 586.76 B: yeah 

586.13 590.03 A: and you have to be more of an i- individual as opposed to 

590.38 593.86 A: listening to just manmade doctrine 

593.65 594.70 B: yeah 

594.43 597.46 A: i think there's a big difference between that but um 

598.15 599.89 A: that definitely is a lifestyle
