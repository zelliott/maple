0.00 2.56 B: they are trying to get rid of a bad man 

3.17 4.55 A: hello 

4.16 5.05 B: hello 

4.94 6.74 A: hi [laughter] 

5.84 12.31 B: hello call partner i was started talking and i wasn't sure whether anybody was there or not 

11.80 20.04 A: i'm here yeah i was still listening to the recording and then i heard you as they were going off my name is karen i live in the state of washington 

20.29 24.96 B: karen it's nice to talk to you i'm over here in philadelphia i've never been 

25.18 29.22 B: i've never been in the state of washington maybe i will be some day 

29.41 35.09 A: it's beautiful and green here everything that it's not in the middle east [laughter] 

34.36 38.44 B: well we'll get back to the topic then 

38.18 39.48 A: yeah 

38.58 43.31 B: i don't know what you've heard so i will try to rephrase myself 

43.50 47.51 B: i think peace will only come when people want peace 

47.91 52.79 B: governments can't mandate it lawyers can't decree it 

52.92 56.10 B: nobody can decree it until 

56.24 63.20 B: two groups of people say you know what we're tired of killing you and hope you're tired of killing us 

65.02 71.43 A: i agree but the problem with that is that these people unfortunately with the government that they have had 

72.05 74.38 A: have been taught from birth 

74.41 80.17 A: so much different than what reality is that they don't even know what they would truly be fighting for 

80.79 88.59 A: you know they've all been so brainwashed in their idiocy and the thought processes against the imperialists and everything you know 

90.30 94.42 A: and it's really sad i mean i'm glad that we went in and did what we did 

95.18 100.29 A: even though it did cost some of our soldiers' lives i think it was necessary 

100.08 106.96 B: but misfortunately that's why they call it sounds clicheish i know but that's why they call it war 

106.78 107.96 A: right 

107.22 108.75 B: people have to 

109.48 112.88 B: people have to fight and people have to die 

113.44 117.87 A: yes and unfortunately a lot of people like i have this argument with my mother 

117.83 130.13 A: every time we see her because she thinks we have no business there and i'm sorry after nine one one i think that it was really important that we sent out a message that no more of this terrorist attitude will be tolerated at all 

130.29 132.57 B: just think of neville chamberlain 

132.70 135.43 B: uh-oh i could be dating myself now 

135.20 136.19 A: mhm 

135.86 139.82 B: neville chamberlain had done that all those many years ago [mn] 

141.85 143.25 B: (( that )) 

142.47 143.39 A: yes 

144.25 146.29 B: that could have saved a 

146.52 148.82 B: whole lot of hassle back then 

148.88 157.99 A: yeah think of how many people would still be around if they had made the move then and i think that that's our problem they have always perceived us as being weak 

152.05 152.78 B: (( yes )) 

158.08 171.53 A: because we're pacifists as we try to be but you know that doesn't necessarily mean weakness tha- and i know that's the whole thing that's the problem it's the way that the men have been raised in the middle east the only thing that they do understand is power 

172.46 175.81 A: and you can't have everybody trying to have this 

175.99 180.99 A: immense amount of power without having to have the struggles that go with it [noise] 

180.68 182.74 B: that's true with every 

182.90 186.05 B: with every right comes responsibility 

186.65 193.97 A: right and unfortunately as we as we've seen in the rule of hussein there was no responsibility to the people 

194.75 198.65 B: no there was only the responsibility of not getting caught [sigh] 

198.58 205.41 A: only the res- responsibility of amassing as much immense wealth as he possibly could at the cost of the people 

205.49 215.49 A: and now we've got all this stuff still going on with israel and i mean every entity over there is fighting amongst themselves i don't i do you really think that they will ever achieve peace 

217.53 223.59 B: that if i could give you that straight answer to that ma'am i would be 

222.99 226.47 A: [laughter] right i don't think so [noise] 

225.30 234.80 B: i i would i would be in i would be in washington or in some think tank or something like that i think peace will only come like i 

231.32 232.55 A: right 

234.95 237.38 B: like i said when people 

237.24 239.27 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

237.74 241.48 B: get tired of killing get tired of killing each other 

241.15 242.47 A: mhm 

241.68 247.77 B: i mean there is a sort of peace you could say in northern ireland now 

247.54 248.67 A: right 

250.63 260.74 B: i can remember back as a kid hearing all about northern ireland and all this stuff that had happened o- that had happened over there 

261.17 261.97 A: [noise] 

262.06 267.17 A: right but then we achieved [noise] this peace here in the united states and then look what happened to our peace 

267.77 269.21 A: on nine eleven [noise] 

270.47 276.12 B: i that's an interesting premise i'm not sure if we've 

277.02 282.23 B: if as americans we've ever been at peace with ourselves 

283.37 286.82 B: but i don't want to get too metaphysical 

286.57 287.94 A: right [laughter] 

287.09 290.00 B: regard- regarding this 

290.00 300.04 A: right i think we're looking at more for an overall peace picture of getting along with each other in a society not necessarily our turmoi- our in- inner turmoils 

300.06 305.61 A: otherwise we can say absolutely not we are too human to ever resolve all of our issues 

306.35 309.13 B: well spoken well said i like that 

309.38 314.03 B: i'm going i'm going to use that in some other conversations down the line 

313.63 314.70 A: [laughter] 

316.62 319.05 A: yeah i don't know i just i was you know 

319.13 325.41 A: a little shocked when they went in and heard some of the things they found with the [noise] torture sites [noise] 

325.70 328.75 A: and the decomposing bodies [noise] and 

328.90 335.40 A: and you have to figure you know if it takes a few lives to end as much of that kind of inhumane treatment 

335.88 338.01 A: that was going onto these people then 

338.15 340.31 A: you have to agree to some level 

340.71 344.20 A: that you can't say it's not my problem it is our world 

345.42 350.31 B: yes it is it is our world and 

350.38 354.70 B: one of the other questions they brought along in this introduction 

354.75 360.75 B: was that do we [mn] do we continue the role of policeman 

361.11 362.20 A: mhm 

361.46 366.36 B: to which i say heck yeah because nobody else is stepping up 

366.02 368.00 A: that's right until they can 

366.62 368.86 B: stepping up to the bat i 

368.67 370.71 A: right i agree with that 

369.22 373.83 B: mean are we are we going to count on the french for anything 

373.36 381.37 A: heck no [noise] and we shouldn't allow the french to step in for anything they didn't want to be involved in it now the only reason they'd want to be involved in anything is for the 

381.44 385.41 A: financial gain they might perceive coming their way from it [noise] 

385.74 389.23 B: oh most definitely i most definitely i agree 

386.57 389.46 A: [noise] 

389.39 392.42 B: with you there but now we'll see how 

392.30 404.00 A: but we're too diplomatic and we'll have to say well we need you know our nato friends we need to get everything back intact again so we'll have to bury the hatchet and of course allow them to get back involved 

397.08 398.19 B: (( yes we )) 

403.88 407.29 B: we we we have the overwhelming urge 

408.38 413.52 B: as i'll put it in this country the overwhelming urge and need to be nice 

413.27 414.79 A: right 

414.36 422.04 B: which is prob- which raises a lot of questions with me because over the years i'm not sure how nice i've been 

422.20 425.91 B: in various encounters but i find myself 

426.41 428.75 B: less nice as we go along 

429.02 441.86 A: right hardened through life though unfortunately it's the experiences that create it not the attitude not the willingness to [mn] you know our less willingness shall we say to maintain the niceties 

442.30 447.09 B: sometimes even in the raising of our own children 

445.77 447.18 A: [noise] 

447.36 449.01 A: [noise] 

447.40 450.55 B: sometimes someone just has to say no 

450.32 451.28 A: right 

451.81 460.90 A: but those are boundaries and i think that that pertains to all society when we raise our children it's necessary for us to give them boundaries for their own safety 

462.20 476.50 A: and that's why i think that until an entity gets involved with the situation that's capable of policing the situation it is our responsibility to those people to not do as we did in kuwait and just back out and leave them hanging 

476.30 478.72 B: [noise] oh yes in fact well 

479.86 484.63 B: i don't know if it played out on the west coast there but 

484.75 488.87 B: over the news this weekend there was talk of a 

489.42 491.62 B: of a rally in 

493.36 497.26 B: a rally in baghdad by the the islamic 

498.21 501.05 B: by the islamic militants about [lipsmack] 

502.58 507.14 B: about time telling us it's time telling us it's time to leave 

506.81 508.53 A: time to go home hm 

508.64 516.46 A: yeah okay well just a few days before that we had an incident in baghdad but we're supposed to leave and think that everything will be okay 

516.45 531.26 A: and let you guys kill it um fight it out amongst yourselves now and there's obviously still militia around at some point so you lay your bat you lay down your gun for a week and we're supposed to say okay we're done and walk off i'm sorry i don't agree 

530.85 539.11 B: i and and i basically i basically agree with you we're probably going to be there for a while 

538.68 539.66 A: mhm 

539.18 541.76 B: and how long a while is 

541.79 548.12 A: however long it takes them to get because i don't think we should appoint a new government i agree 

548.20 552.65 A: to the point that you know now it has to be their government created by them 

552.81 558.61 A: but in the meantime if they can't step up to the task we may have to 

555.45 564.71 B: if they can't if they or if they can't find yeah right if they it's just like in pakistan if they can't find a hamid kazai 

565.37 569.92 B: um somebody's got to find a hamid kazai for them 

568.94 572.94 A: right or at least a temporary fulfillment of that need 

573.65 585.58 A: you know uh but the problem is i don't know how much our government believes that anybody will step in there on a temporary basis and be willing to give up the rule when it's time to allow them to put in their own government 

586.03 587.46 B: (( well )) 

587.16 592.92 A: that's why i think that yes you know we don't need to be in as strong of a force as we have been 

592.96 596.78 A: but i do believe we're going to need to be involved in it for some time to come 

597.09 599.95 B: uh i i agree and how does
