571.96 575.71 B: he just wants to jump the gun him and tony blair 

576.07 578.00 B: i think they're both butt buddies 

582.57 585.98 B: but gore would have made sure we had the u._n. backing 

586.19 589.15 B: bush on the other hand he didn't give a fuck if they were behind us or not 

589.08 590.65 A: yeah just went for it
