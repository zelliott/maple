1.98 3.16 A: hello 

2.71 4.02 B: hello 

3.78 4.95 A: hi 

4.48 5.64 B: hi 

5.27 11.89 A: ah my name is sharon and hi amber i'm i'm from evansville indiana where are you from 

6.99 8.56 B: (( i'm amber )) 

11.07 14.13 B: i'm from um ellington connecticut 

14.06 16.31 A: [mn] well it's nice to meet you amber 

15.48 18.42 B: (( nice to meet you too [laughter] )) 

16.95 21.08 A: [laughter] i had trouble hearing the topic 

21.12 28.83 A: ah but i believe it was supposed to be about peace in the middle east but the very first ah couple of lines that she said was not clear 

28.38 31.21 B: okay what she basically said was 

31.38 43.18 B: um how do you feel about peace in the middle east do you think that peace will ever be obtained do you think that the united states should stay involved [noise] that's basically what she [noise] 

43.65 48.19 B: you know [laughter] give or take ah little bits that's basically what she said 

47.37 48.54 A: (( oh okay okay )) 

49.02 50.62 A: well you want to start 

50.29 55.29 B: sure [laughter] um you know what i don't think peace will ever be attained 

55.34 62.13 B: i i mean that sounds like a real negative way of looking at it but i don't really think that the um 

64.04 75.99 B: [noise] that there's any way that every single person in that area is going to be satisfied and without them being satisfied i don't think there will ever be a true peace 

75.96 77.02 A: you know that 

76.08 78.87 B: i think there might come a time when 

79.20 89.10 B: the reins [noise] are tighter and you keep things under control better but i don't really ever think there will a true peace as like what we know in the united states here where you can 

89.61 99.20 B: you know express your opinion by a vote or what a demonstration or whatever but it doesn't escalate beyond that i don't know go you go ahead [laughter] 

98.89 108.96 A: no i was just going to say that that was my thoughts exactly i i just i just don't see that happening either and [mn] i think that whole concept is so foreign 

108.81 114.95 A: over there that they they just i don't really think they truly comprehend that process [laughter] you know 

114.27 115.35 B: yeah 

114.97 115.95 A: um 

116.35 122.09 A: [lipsmack] i i just don't really see it as as happening either and i think it's unfortunate 

122.27 127.65 A: um and as far as the united states staying involved in it [sigh] 

127.76 134.35 A: i would love to think we could do something [laughter] i really would love to think that we could do something but um 

134.56 138.90 A: [lipsmack] i don't know going to war and all i don't i don't really see that as being the answer 

138.78 142.45 B: yeah i'm not sure there's a whole lot 

139.15 139.96 A: (( [mn] )) 

142.54 146.49 B: that we can do that's going to help the situation over there i think 

146.63 148.06 B: that 

148.41 154.06 B: we might have to stay involved because we might have to protect our own interests 

154.60 155.82 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

154.62 162.81 B: um at certain times especially like you know if you have to go after a terrorist there or you have to you know do something that will 

163.29 164.72 B: prevent [noise] attacks 

164.79 168.01 B: on the united states but i also think that 

168.22 171.04 B: the more our presence in the area 

171.30 174.85 B: is a large one the more it seems to stir up 

175.05 177.88 B: it doesn't seem to calm anybody down so 

177.07 184.84 A: absolutely and i i think because of our presence that um you know it's going to be stirring up more things um 

183.71 187.13 B: yeah and down the road we're going to pay another price for this 

186.24 188.31 A: yeah absolutely 

187.62 193.42 B: for all the children you know y- all you'd have to do is have you know traumatize another generation 

193.67 198.82 B: and then you've got [laughter] you know what i mean it's just another a whole wave to deal with and 

198.88 205.96 B: um i don't know i'm i'm hoping you always hope and pray for the best but [noise] i'm not really um 

206.32 211.77 B: really too optimistic that because i i just see too many parties whose 

212.27 213.39 B: (( goals )) 

213.58 222.90 B: are at odds with each other i mean you even look at iraq and you look at okay now perhaps they'll still um you know have a peaceful 

223.12 228.50 B: a chance at peace and a chance at democracy but then you've got like the kurds well the kurds 

228.68 229.64 B: are 

229.84 231.80 B: (( tot- they're )) 

231.98 234.87 B: um objectives are totally at odds 

235.05 235.97 B: with 

235.98 242.27 B: being brought under a banner of a- you know any other anybody else anywhere 

242.94 252.45 B: and then there's that whole of 'em in turkey and then turkey's afraid that their kurds are gonna rise up you know what i mean so i i don't really see that 

253.02 255.06 B: y- you get anywhere 

255.83 257.94 B: you know with this 

258.86 265.66 B: whole process you know [noise] an- and the same thing the palestinians if you if the palestinians are um 

260.50 261.20 A: right 

267.13 276.89 B: you know if they get satisfied if they get land you're really doing it th- at the expense of jewish settlers and whatever who are then going to be 

276.88 290.04 B: [laughter] just as radical in the other direction so i don't know [laughter] [laughter] i just don't i don't think you can just you know you'd need probably like six times more of the exact same land for everybody to be [laughter] you 

280.71 282.97 A: [laughter] 

291.01 294.58 B: know what i mean everybody to be able to do exactly what they wanted 

294.17 298.56 A: right a- a- and that's not a possibility either [laughter] 

296.55 300.59 B: [laughter] yeah and and united states 

301.30 302.56 B: our interests 

302.80 304.90 B: are are kind of like 

305.72 315.03 B: usually are not the interests of either side you know what i mean our interests are in addition to everybody else's interests so you've got you know like 

315.12 325.24 B: the palestinians' interests the israelis' interests and then our interests and i don't think any three of them a- any you know two of the three are the same thing 

325.98 332.40 B: so i us getting involved i think [laughter] is muddying the water in most cases especially that situation 

332.01 333.17 A: mhm 

333.03 342.41 B: you know i i think at this point we've got to stay involved in iraq i mean y- we're in there we you know uprooted the whole country at that p- this point we can't 

342.45 345.77 B: withdraw and leave a mess so i don't think we're 

345.01 350.76 A: and it is a mess i mean look what happened you know everybody just went wild over there 

346.64 347.75 B: (( yeah )) 

347.76 348.96 B: (( yeah )) 

350.29 355.25 B: right so i think at this point we owe it to the people 

355.72 361.23 B: if we've toppled one government we owe it to them to stay there until there is 

361.42 365.03 B: at least some hopes of another stable government 

365.71 369.76 B: so i don't think you're gonna get out you know you're going to be able to pull out from that but 

367.59 368.47 A: right 

369.49 372.93 A: i'm curious it was on c._n._n. today um 

373.33 379.83 A: they were talking about you know the news media was asking is it possible that we would set up a a base over there 

375.46 376.55 B: [noise] 

379.50 381.04 B: [noise] oh really 

380.53 387.49 A: yeah and ah of course the response was probably not likely but it it seemed to 

381.59 389.69 B: (( [noise] )) 

388.10 394.96 A: but the news media thought seemed to think that that would be a good idea [laughter] to have a permanent u._s. base over there now 

393.88 396.26 B: in in in iraq 

395.29 396.68 A: yeah 

397.32 403.57 B: oh it just seems like one more place that um you're gonna put people into danger 

404.53 405.61 B: um 

405.64 410.17 B: i don't know [laughter] you know servicemen you know if you you put a you 

406.40 407.57 A: yeah 

410.88 418.98 B: you're gonna get another u._s._s. cole or you're gonna get another bombing of their headquarters or something like what's going on because you're just putting them in 

419.94 423.18 B: harm's way and i don't i'm not sure really what you would 

423.68 424.87 B: be gaining 

424.84 428.71 A: well i got the impression that that was not gonna happen but 

429.30 443.03 B: huh well i i kinda hope not 'cause i think if anything's going to radicalize the population [laughter] something like that is because that's gonna prove to them what they've been afraid of all along and that is that we're trying to take over the region 

429.95 430.64 A: yeah 

431.56 432.95 A: (( [mn] [cough] )) 

442.69 443.66 A: mhm 

443.16 445.33 B: and dictate to 'em and i think 

445.54 450.91 B: that it's in our best interest at this point to prove to them that that's not what we're going to do but 

451.39 457.62 B: i don't know [laughter] nobody listens to [laughter] people at our level anyway right 

452.31 453.84 A: [laughter] 

456.45 458.98 A: right [laughter] 

458.32 461.23 B: so i don't know it just seems like even if you 

461.51 465.46 B: even if you had the power to make anything at all 

465.71 466.95 B: occur 

467.03 473.64 B: in that area that you wanted to occur you know like you just you know overnight it would happen 

473.72 476.91 B: i'm not even sure then i would be able to tell you 

478.05 480.25 B: a good plan you know what 

481.39 486.14 B: what is a good plan but also they have been at war for how many 

486.40 487.88 A: (( [mn] oh )) 

487.55 495.21 B: you know thousands of years they've been at war in that area it's not like this is anything new it shouldn't really surprise anybody 

488.79 490.18 A: right 

495.58 501.02 B: you know even in the bible they were [laughter] the same g- groups of people were at war with each other 

501.51 502.66 B: so um 

503.13 505.26 B: i mean that's a long time ago 

505.15 510.77 A: [mn] well it seems like we're we're pretty much in total agreement on this issue [laughter] 

509.21 513.97 B: yeah but i i don't know yo- you kind of wonder 

515.04 519.69 B: i suppose there are some real radical opinions but even then 

520.07 521.48 B: i mean like i 

521.70 525.46 B: heard a lot of people say say like be against the war 

525.60 531.61 B: but i didn't hear a whole lot of people who were against the war that had another plan 

531.82 532.83 A: (( yeah right )) 

532.24 534.09 B: you know what i mean so how 

534.13 545.58 B: how do you ac- achieve your objectives well it's one thing to be against something but i think that you also then should have an alternative um 

546.19 553.38 B: i don't know maybe they thought that you know just going on the same path was an alternative and i mean i don't i guess 

551.79 553.42 A: (( but )) 

553.59 554.94 B: that would have been 

555.41 557.71 B: although it didn't seem like it was working 

558.65 560.24 B: but anyway 

559.54 562.26 A: are we sure that this is working [laughter] 

561.70 563.65 B: yeah i'm not sure 

563.24 564.76 A: i'm not either 

564.16 566.55 B: yeah we don't we don't 

566.60 569.23 B: um have a lot of um 

569.96 572.84 B: like we don't have a television in our hou- home 

573.00 574.84 B: and so we don't 

574.97 582.15 B: we get most of our information either from magazines or from newspapers or either that or from the radio so 

582.17 586.61 B: it's not like i've been having constant exposure to what's going on either 

586.17 587.23 A: mhm 

586.77 595.25 B: but the papers today said that they had found chemical or the the precursors of chemical weapons in iraq 

594.64 595.82 A: yes 

595.81 598.30 B: so it looks like that 

598.32 599.90 B: going in there anyw-
