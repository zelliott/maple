0.98 2.33 A: hi 

2.27 3.53 B: hello 

3.32 5.33 A: hi yeah uh who are you 

5.47 8.31 B: uh hi um my name is don 

8.12 9.86 A: (( hi what's up don i'm john )) 

9.80 10.70 B: uh-huh 

10.42 11.59 A: where you from 

11.40 14.84 B: uh well from uh new york state 

14.29 24.53 A: oh yeah yeah i'm from uh michigan state actually that's where i'm at school so what do you think about this whole uh middle east conflict huh [noise] 

14.89 16.23 B: mhm 

18.58 19.62 B: (( mhm )) 

25.00 30.15 B: [sigh] well i think that uh [sigh] it's something that we've 

30.39 32.58 B: gotten way too involved in 

32.23 34.16 A: mhm 

32.74 41.26 B: and uh you know i think that there's a lot of uh expense that the uh country isn't prepared for in the middle east 

40.74 42.36 A: really 

41.40 46.62 B: uh i think we've you know i mean i think we've left a mess in afghanistan and we're 

46.85 51.13 B: if we're not careful we'll be leaving a similar mess over in iraq 

50.67 57.93 A: mhm huh so you don't feel that we should have gotten involved in this war even though it's turned out so positively 

56.24 57.11 B: uh-huh 

57.79 59.19 B: no no 

58.86 60.14 A: not at all 

60.22 62.07 A: well i mean um 

62.41 67.38 A: i had this discussion with my roommate earlier don't you feel that saddam hussein was some sort of threat at all or no 

67.62 68.92 B: um 

69.29 76.25 B: possibly but i i just not enough i didn't feel strongly enough that uh we needed to take the action that we did 

76.61 84.26 A: really well i guess i kinda have to question that because you know i mean we saw saddam gas the kurds to the north and i mean 

84.42 89.83 A: does isn't that extreme enough of an action for you to make uh to uh justify s- the uh 

89.85 97.59 A: the course of action we took or i mean i i guess i'm failing to understand why you wouldn't think that's enough uh justification 

98.34 102.69 B: well now i i felt that um the uh 

103.35 114.43 B: i thought that our motives would be questioned from the start and i think they'll continue to be questioned um you know uh i think that uh we're going to be 

107.50 111.76 A: mm of course yeah mhm mhm 

115.06 120.96 B: uh held responsible now for a- an awful lot more than we ever bargained for 

120.65 121.78 A: well what do you mean 

121.53 134.43 B: uh in terms of curing the ills of iraq um you know there's a lot of problems over there and it it it's an incredible there's incredible needs over there that um 

125.46 127.33 A: right 

134.60 140.96 B: you know we're not you know basic needs here in this country that we shouldn't be overextending ourselves 

139.28 140.59 A: oh 

140.62 141.97 A: i see what you're saying 

141.41 143.23 B: in another country 

141.98 143.78 A: (( yeah okay )) 

143.86 150.64 A: well i mean don't you feel to a certain extent being that we are as rich as we are that we have a certain responsibility to uh 

151.07 154.67 A: to those other countries in curing their ills as you said 

154.66 166.61 B: well it you know we do but i think that uh we need to if we're having a a responsibility to other countries i think we need to work with other countries in that responsibility 

166.19 167.97 A: mhm 

166.66 173.31 B: to to just uh overstep the u._n. and arbitrarily do our own 

173.70 175.29 B: (( thing )) 

174.98 176.31 A: mhm 

175.39 177.70 B: irrespective of uh 

177.74 185.59 B: you know i mean we we had very little support really uh i mean they may have listed a lot of two bit countries in support of us but uh 

180.94 182.66 A: right 

185.68 190.80 B: among major countries we really didn't have very much support to move ahead with this war 

190.96 193.76 A: well i mean but why do you think that is 

194.73 206.97 B: uh a lot of reasons go into that but uh and and you know i'm sure a lot of self interest goes into that when uh france has a lot of uh uh debt to iraq and uh 

200.22 201.47 A: mhm 

205.80 207.60 A: mhm 

206.94 214.75 B: they of course want to be repaid they know that the odds of that are pretty slim if iraq is uh blown to smithereens 

214.09 215.81 A: [laughter] 

215.04 218.89 B: um you know there's a lot of self interest certainly 

218.05 219.23 A: (( right )) 

218.86 222.78 B: but nonetheless uh to for us to move ahead 

222.66 236.81 B: without the uh u._n. sanction i think puts us immediately in the um in a negative light among the arab w- world and i think we continue to be in a negative light among the a- arab nations 

236.44 237.19 A: (( hm )) 

237.71 238.77 A: i see 

238.59 246.55 A: but i mean earlier weren't you just saying that we should be more concerned about our our troubles at home and that we're overextending ourselves so i mean 

245.58 247.04 B: mhm mhm 

246.34 260.60 A: it seems like you question france's motives in uh not supporting us because you know they were very self interested but isn't that very much the same thing that's occurring with us you know if uh according to you at least i'm i'm just i'm just asking i'm curious 

260.46 261.13 B: (( y- )) 

261.40 263.90 B: no i'm not sure i follow the line [mn] 

263.44 268.05 A: mm-kay well basically just like you questioned france's 

268.22 271.49 A: you questioned the fact that france didn't support us in the war correct 

270.82 274.29 B: right that they have their own self interest at heart uh-huh 

273.14 287.69 A: right right so i mean if you question that then why would why would you suggest that we should be uh interested in ourselves first instead of uh uh helping out these other countries or protecting ourselves you know 

287.37 291.17 B: okay okay i see what you mean um oh well i 

289.15 290.07 A: yeah 

291.07 302.41 B: you know i i guess i don't necessarily question or say that that's wrong i mean i just say that their motivations for w- why they choose to support or not support 

295.54 297.47 A: mhm 

302.29 306.67 B: a war in iraq are complicated are complex and uh 

304.62 307.37 A: right mhm 

306.70 311.09 B: you know i i think that there is also a large sentiment too that uh 

311.57 318.52 B: many of the problems in iraq uh we had a a major role in in developing in in 

317.27 319.25 A: really what do you mean by that 

318.65 325.61 B: our past support of of saddam in his war against iran and uh 

321.16 322.95 A: mhm 

323.51 325.56 A: mhm 

326.07 328.65 B: you know we um the 

328.95 331.59 B: uh what was it the 

331.76 339.95 B: a lot of impact of yu- one heard quite a bit about how if we ever found m- weapons of mass destruction they'd probably 

339.73 349.81 B: would largely say made in the u._s._a. on them uh that we supported them i- i- in terms of even arms providing arms to iraq 

342.40 344.67 A: (( right right )) 

349.96 359.14 B: and uh you know in a in a sense i couldn't blame other countries for saying we made the problem we can deal with the problem 

358.46 360.30 A: mhm 

359.89 361.32 B: we're on our own 

362.60 363.38 A: (( hm )) 

363.09 370.54 B: i i think that there's a lot of history there that uh you know used to be the ambassador to iraq and uh 

370.01 370.75 A: (( mm )) 

370.65 373.06 B: um a lot of 

373.59 380.89 B: there's this whole uh reparation thing with uh bectal corporation moving right in and taking over uh with uh 

378.69 380.51 A: mhm 

381.01 385.95 B: uh what's his name ronnie bectal that uh used to be reagan's uh 

386.54 388.94 B: secretary of state i think he was 

388.56 390.95 A: can't i can't say i honestly remember 

390.59 393.85 B: yeah yeah um bectal 

391.84 392.94 A: but uh 

394.85 402.14 B: for all sorts of money after being one of the largest campaign contributors to the republican party and president bush 

402.07 407.26 A: [sigh] so you view this war as uh solely i i don't know like 

407.07 416.42 B: i i view it don't view it solely as anything and i just see a whole lot of negative motivations going on and from all different sorts of angles here 

413.10 414.17 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

415.80 417.09 A: (( mhm [sigh] )) 

416.40 430.75 B: that uh i just see very little truly good coming from it you know and and i can't say that i blame the average iraqi sitting over there without electric without water without much of anything 

430.66 434.89 B: being really pleased that they're free now of saddam 

434.62 436.39 A: right 

436.67 438.50 B: you know they may have had it 

436.79 446.05 A: w- well oh well but i mean isn't that a positive positive result of this war and i mean even even that there may have been some negative motives 

442.16 443.68 B: maybe maybe not 

444.50 457.10 B: maybe maybe not now in afghanistan we got the warlords moving right in and taking over and they're running things uh probably not too far afield from what the taliban were doing how do we know the same isn't going to happen in iraq 

457.81 461.40 A: um you know i i really don't know but i mean 

461.54 464.68 A: um as i've seen it seems like that 

464.81 474.30 A: in we've we've kept a certain responsibility maybe because of afghanistan in our endeavors in iraq in that we have to establish some sort of uh 

474.75 480.34 A: some sort of i guess law system over there some sort of justice at this time so i mean 

480.37 482.42 A: w- from what i've 

481.54 490.50 B: i think the magnitude of change that's needed requires so much more than anything that we as one nation can offer 

490.13 492.04 A: mhm 

490.69 501.00 B: uh in in one effort um a culture that's so radically different that to to expect that uh iraqis are going to 

495.81 497.48 A: right 

501.10 505.82 B: uh bow down in gratitude for the uh 

505.83 508.66 B: honor of democracy being 

508.81 520.71 B: whisked upon them or or whatever you know i just think that that's a that's a real fantasy that that the republicans had that the uh iraqis were going to be so grateful for 

519.79 532.91 A: well i mean but in all honesty do you b- do you believe that that's that's the kind of viewpoint that we've taken that we were gonna some sort of cultural imperialism just come over there and just assume that that that that's how you feel in all honesty 

529.06 529.83 B: yeah 

531.39 532.17 B: yeah 

532.81 533.88 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

533.27 536.23 A: well i mean haven't you haven't you listened 

535.35 547.69 B: i think i think it's very very uh egocentric for us to assume that uh you know the way we run the show is is uh the best way for a totally different culture to run their 

547.72 548.93 B: operation 

547.82 549.11 A: mhm 

549.50 556.74 A: well i i guess i have to disagree with you there just because you know i can't i can't honestly believe that we would 

556.54 570.95 A: um just throw our system on top of theirs i mean it seems like we've been trying to work with their people in order to establish some sort of working government because we understand that should we i mean we're under a lot of under a lot of kind uh 

571.10 574.26 A: under a lot of what word am i looking for here just um 

574.94 578.69 A: [lipsmack] uh we're we're being we we're being watched by everyone you know 

578.36 580.04 B: of course yeah 

579.51 581.07 A: yeah so i mean 

581.34 583.82 A: i don't think that 

583.87 593.23 A: our government is stupid enough to like try to enforce our our way of life on them because you know it that's going to be seen as a very 

593.36 599.89 A: imperialistic move by the rest of the world i think that we have a certain responsibility to the rest of the world and people are and
