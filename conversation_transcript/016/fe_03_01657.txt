3.38 7.34 A: hi this is jane in colorado springs colorado 

6.94 8.17 B: oh hi 

8.00 11.86 A: [laughter] we i've been talking to people from all over the country 

11.18 15.53 B: yeah you're way over on the other side of the world [laughter] the country from us yeah 

13.45 15.79 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

15.93 20.51 A: um i guess our topic today is issues in the middle east 

19.65 24.25 B: yes well certainly a a current and um important topic 

24.10 26.74 A: um no doubt yes [laughter] 

26.50 31.51 B: do you have anyone that you know or any relatives that are serving over in the middle east 

31.45 34.39 A: um no i do not um 

34.45 41.85 A: [lipsmack] we are in a military community here with the air force base and n._o._r._a._d. and um 

40.65 41.73 B: (( oh sure )) 

41.87 45.84 A: we have fort carson army facility here also 

45.87 53.60 A: but um i don't know anybody personally but our community has been affected tremendously 

48.62 50.21 B: mhm 

53.07 54.40 B: oh yeah 

53.62 57.79 A: through the kids in the school that have parents involved and so forth so 

56.96 58.43 B: mhm 

58.01 59.21 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

59.22 60.36 A: but 

60.64 67.79 A: ah i guess i feel quite strongly that the united states did the right thing by going in there 

67.97 70.57 A: um to try to 

70.63 71.65 A: um 

71.79 75.27 A: [lipsmack] let the world know we don't put up with terrorism [mn] 

74.80 79.13 B: right and to try and bring about peace even in a in in this way 

79.18 85.82 B: i'm no- i don't i don't like the idea of war um but there are some 

85.97 92.14 B: situations that just i mean they were given so many opportunities um iraq was to 

91.33 92.97 A: exactly 

92.34 101.56 B: come up with the weapons of mass destruction and and now it's not it it's even more than that and and in watching all the news it's it's [sigh] 

101.44 113.67 B: almost impossible to keep current with everything because now we're looking at syria because they were harboring some of the terrorists or aiding them and [lipsmack] and just so there's so much more work to be done 

113.71 128.43 B: in over there or in the middle east so i have a feeling that um although it looks as if they're you know putting in a a er interim government for iraq we've got so much more work to do and it just saddens me because we've got so many military 

128.53 135.38 B: men and women over there who uh will obviously be there for quite some time and i do have a friend um 

135.64 142.14 B: he was in our wedding as a matter of fact and he was serving over in kuwait he's with the air force and he's with the refueling wing 

137.60 138.61 A: mhm 

142.24 146.00 B: and he's over there and of course he has no idea when he'll be back 

146.12 147.16 A: yes 

146.92 151.57 B: so it's it's very difficult for his family and and friends to uh 

151.67 153.56 B: to see all of this happening 

153.97 160.29 A: right i agree and i do agree that war i mean i don't think anybody is for war but 

160.52 168.54 A: this seemed to be the only solution and as you say we gave them every opportunity to cooperate and we got nowhere 

168.08 169.23 B: (( yes )) 

169.07 173.80 A: and i truly believe that saddam hussein was involved 

174.30 177.02 A: and has been for many years 

177.29 182.01 A: in the terrorism and probably had his connections with 

182.50 184.81 A: mr osama bin laden 

183.50 185.85 B: mhm probably yes 

185.21 189.62 A: in the september eleventh issues as well and um 

190.19 197.02 A: i i don't know how much longer we'll be there but i think we'll be there for a while yet and 

195.16 196.25 B: (( yes )) 

197.04 200.13 A: i hope that the united states will [lipsmack] 

201.25 203.48 A: continue to monitor 

204.49 206.45 A: their um 

207.24 210.51 A: reaching for a democratic society 

209.90 211.39 B: mhm 

211.00 221.86 A: um i mean i don't feel it's our fault that they're looting their own facilities and banks and things like that i mean we cannot be responsible for that 

216.27 217.69 B: (( oh no )) 

219.02 219.90 B: (( no )) 

221.20 222.07 B: (( no )) 

222.47 223.54 A: and 

222.53 235.73 B: and i don't feel like we've occupied their country i think that we went in and and we're helping and and [mn] the way that that some of the media and of course some people in the mid- middle east are looking at it is that we've occupied their country and 

235.07 236.10 A: mhm 

235.64 243.83 B: and almost as if you know they're going to become another state of ours well of course we don't [laughter] no way no way [laughter] no way 

240.25 251.74 A: we don't want 'em [laughter] we don't want 'em and i i don't see that twisted way of thinking either but you know it's an excuse on their behalf not to have to 

246.39 247.26 B: no 

249.59 250.69 B: yeah 

252.21 257.65 A: 'fess up to their own mistakes and and that's the way evil works you know 

257.27 264.16 B: i just wish we would know um where saddam hussein is if he's alive if he's not 

264.18 265.26 B: um 

265.38 277.18 B: i mean we went into afghanistan and did all kinds of searching for osama bin laden and and in my opinion looked a little foolish because we couldn't come up with one s- one man 

276.97 278.19 A: mhm 

277.36 279.65 B: and now it seems as if uh 

279.67 285.43 B: we're in the same boat with uh saddam hussein we don't know whether he's [mn] is out there any more 

286.37 289.47 A: i think he's still alive [laughter] 

286.94 288.80 B: too bad i think it would put 

289.07 295.18 B: do you is that your opinion yeah i mean i think it would put a lot of things to rest if we knew one way or the other 

289.85 290.70 A: yes 

295.29 296.42 A: mhm 

296.34 305.75 B: but unfortunately that's not the case right now i think that the the united states is always for ever and ever going to play a major role in peace [mn] 

305.86 307.36 B: throughout the world 

307.26 319.55 A: well i agree and we always have i mean look how many countries we have aided in past situations and we've always been the forerunner to try to help people put things back together 

319.92 328.35 A: and i'm just pleased with some of the countries that we have supported in the past and they are not supporting us in this issue 

327.81 329.17 B: mhm 

328.38 335.54 A: i mean we're fighting for not only the freedom of the united states but the freedom of the world here from terrorism 

335.28 340.19 B: mhm that's for sure what happened i- um in new york city could have happened anywhere 

339.86 345.45 A: exactly but they hit us because we were one of the leaders in the world 

345.99 347.60 A: and 

346.98 349.31 B: make the most impact i think 

348.24 354.36 A: yes and while they certainly did and you know financially our country has 

350.43 351.62 B: mhm 

354.59 356.46 A: taken a big dive 

355.86 358.27 B: sure we haven't rebounded yet 

357.61 365.79 A: oh and i think it will be another couple of years before we come even close to to regaining some of that ground we lost 

365.13 366.64 B: mhm 

366.17 367.87 A: but um 

369.04 381.07 A: i agree i there was no other option but for us to go in there and i hope that we do stay there for a while to help them get back on their feet and i know that there are probably leaders 

381.14 385.15 A: there that we don't hear much about that are 

385.45 392.81 A: wanting to step forward and get the democracy going where their people are not suppressed 

393.03 397.28 A: and can take a hand in running their country you know 

396.67 398.72 B: mhm mhm 

398.49 409.47 A: we get a distorted view from the news [laughter] like you say one [mn] you know one thing happens and then another thing happens and then you don't know which is true and which is not true and 

401.28 402.70 B: [laughter] 

409.88 412.65 A: from what they said the day before you know 

412.16 413.17 B: right 

413.66 418.51 A: so um but i do think we will be there for a while yet 

418.21 427.74 B: i do too um although it was nice to see on the news tonight that some of the um local troops of our um air fueling wing did come home today 

427.31 429.42 A: oh did they okay 

427.91 434.48 B: uh yes i don't it was just a small number of maybe one plane load or bus load it seemed but 

433.65 434.47 A: yeah 

434.58 442.03 B: at least some of them came home so some things are wrapping up although i have a feeling that you know it could they could be deployed again at any time 

441.92 442.99 A: mhm 

442.04 445.34 B: um were anything else to come up but uh 

444.51 450.02 A: well i think there probably will like you say with syria because they're harboring 

447.87 448.83 B: yeah 

451.03 463.24 A: terrorists as well and who knows maybe that's where saddam hussein is hiding out you know if he did escape that's probably the place he would all he could go that's close by 

461.70 462.55 B: right 

463.78 469.77 B: it is pretty amazing all the things that that uh i guess i never considered before like um 

469.75 478.80 B: the the questioning of all of the um or as many of the scientists that they could find and uh about where they would if they would tell us where 

478.73 491.82 B: the the weapons or even the um [lipsmack] the uh parts to them you know the chemicals needed for them where they're stashing them or where they were um producing them so hopefully they can get some answers 

483.39 484.61 A: mhm 

491.97 502.74 A: they will probably convince somebody to talk somewhere along the line you know if if they know that they may get some asylum or something like that and 

494.20 495.68 B: um i think so 

502.71 510.61 A: and them as well as their family because i'm sure that's how saddam put it you know if you don't do what i tell you i'm going to kill your kids 

506.08 508.93 B: yes yeah just your own 

510.17 511.17 B: right 

511.23 512.62 A: and 

513.25 514.86 A: so they do 

514.97 519.87 A: what they can at the point in time even though it may not be right but 

519.98 526.30 A: their lives are in danger their family's in danger and i can see why they did what they did 

525.74 526.66 B: sure 

526.73 530.11 B: now you said you've talked with other people tonight about the same subject 

529.81 535.36 A: um not tonight i talked with people last week on the the nine eleven issue 

530.91 531.80 B: oh 

534.75 536.33 B: oh yes so did i 

536.09 541.44 A: um but i haven't talked with anyone else today um regarding the current 

539.15 539.99 B: oh 

541.84 544.17 A: situation but um 

542.46 543.53 B: mhm 

545.21 547.81 A: i and i also 

548.22 556.95 A: i don't know somehow no matter what the topic is it always keeps coming back to this current thing either nine eleven or the war you know [laughter] 

553.28 554.48 B: sure does 

555.53 559.27 B: yeah it's it's easy to get back get right to it actually 

558.48 559.94 A: ah 

559.66 561.50 B: it affects everything we do 

561.42 564.58 A: no yes no doubt um 

566.41 567.91 A: i i just 

568.70 572.57 A: i feel bad for those that have lost their lives over there 

571.99 573.45 B: (( oh i know )) 

572.75 576.68 A: and and those that were held prisoner you know they've 

577.61 581.04 A: been able to free them um but 

581.60 586.81 A: [mn] i don't know i still think saddam is hiding out somewhere i don't think that he's 

587.65 589.75 A: dead i wish he were dead 

590.03 594.23 A: and [laughter] and i think a lot of people wish he were dead 

593.47 594.99 B: (( yeah ahah )) 

594.57 599.89 A: um if he isn't dead i hope maybe he's severely injured i don't know because
