0.44 1.66 B: hello 

1.44 2.68 A: hello 

2.52 4.57 B: hi my name is lynn 

4.56 5.91 A: i'm dorinda 

5.75 9.82 B: hello [laughter] um d- do you wanna go first 

8.07 8.82 A: hello 

10.10 11.52 A: oh i don't care 

11.12 12.05 B: okay 

11.68 12.94 A: (( do you want me to go first )) 

12.50 13.44 B: sure 

13.58 16.46 A: okay um well i um 

16.56 28.50 A: i'm not sure that it does that much because i i'm not real sure that they um well i i flew um last month and well i flew actually 

28.69 35.43 A: end of february march and um they check your bags and sometimes it doesn't seem like they 

36.49 42.56 A: they check 'em really really that good like they see all the maybe the littler things you could put in 'em 

42.30 43.54 B: oh 

43.59 58.04 A: you know like they were saying that some people are being stopped for you know nail files and that kinda stuff and i had stuff like that in some of my luggage and they didn't get any of that they didn't even stop it at the metal detector 

49.22 50.65 B: (( mhm )) 

57.71 58.99 B: oh really 

58.85 61.21 A: yeah so i'm not 

59.97 63.34 B: i haven't flown i haven't flown in 

63.69 66.83 B: well a few years at least 

67.03 68.30 B: and uh 

69.00 72.28 B: so i haven't been through the checkout since they've 

72.80 75.25 B: changed things 

75.41 76.06 A: (( mm )) 

75.43 76.52 B: um 

76.75 87.08 B: i think that we need to have marshalls armed marshalls on the planes if they really want to secure the flights like they do in israel 

85.86 86.65 A: oh r- 

87.63 88.57 A: right 

87.73 92.36 B: you know i mean just have security there armed ready 

92.63 100.79 B: because even with the pilots having guns i mean i i hate the thought of the guy driving the plane up there in a gun fight 

100.67 102.39 A: right while you're 

101.31 102.17 B: (( you know )) 

102.85 104.19 B: yeah [laughter] 

103.72 107.07 A: while you're riding on his airplane that's a little bit scary 

106.48 111.36 B: isn't it though i know and uh [sigh] 

111.29 124.71 B: so i [sigh] i don't like the idea of flying i think it might be a hair safer but i i think about all the people who work at the airports who have access to baggage and you know i mean how many 

122.55 123.96 A: right 

125.07 129.53 B: planted terrorists are still working with airlines 

129.47 137.36 A: right and not only that but how many people making that little bit of money couldn't be bought off 

137.03 138.69 B: (( you know oh completely )) 

137.82 146.82 A: that's that's what i worry about that they you know they don't pay those guys so much and someone comes and maybe offers them fifty thousand dollars 

146.21 147.39 B: sure 

147.17 151.55 A: and it would be really really hard to trace who put it actually on the plane 

151.14 152.60 B: yeah 

152.57 156.38 A: so i mean they've gotta to me there's gotta be 

157.80 159.15 A: something 

159.28 161.25 A: you know they could do maybe ev- 

159.96 161.25 B: something better 

161.57 167.46 A: maybe more than one person loading it on the plane or watching it at all times or 

167.88 168.62 A: it's y- 

167.89 169.37 B: yeah i think 

169.49 177.52 B: el al ever since they started having armed guards i don't think they've had a hijacking or an incident 

177.96 180.49 B: in years since they've done that 

180.63 185.54 B: and um i mean you hate to think of it being like that but boy 

186.29 189.37 B: [sigh] after nine eleven i mean my god 

189.53 196.33 A: yeah i think i would feel a lot safer knowing that there was somebody sitting in the front of the plane that had a gun 

196.18 199.59 B: mhm who was hired just to patrol 

200.08 201.38 B: the airplane 

201.52 202.91 A: right 

202.18 209.02 B: you know it's i mean it's just not like a bus it's just you know once you're up there you're [laughter] 

208.89 214.56 A: right you don't want the pilot coming out and start you know like you said exchanging gunfire with somebody 

211.10 212.54 B: (( right )) 

214.29 221.85 B: exactly and i feel like you know it really puts the flight attendants in such a weird position i mean 

221.07 222.04 A: right 

222.42 225.69 B: yeah how many times have you flown since nine eleven 

226.05 229.82 A: um one two twice i think 

229.54 231.67 B: oh really where where do ou live 

230.63 233.59 A: yeah not very much i live in california 

233.03 234.06 B: oh do you 

234.09 236.83 B: yeah i'm up in washington where did you fly to 

234.36 235.30 A: yeah 

237.14 241.24 A: i i just flew from southern california to northern california 

240.62 241.60 B: yeah 

241.15 255.54 A: so i didn't fly real far but still uh it you know it gave me that uneasy feeling in my stomach when we were going through security and you know you see people and and um you know you just you're really it makes you really 

248.82 250.45 B: oh yeah 

255.55 258.59 A: look at the people who are getting on your [laughter] flight 

257.91 259.16 B: right 

259.46 261.74 B: i'll bet it does i 

260.95 262.50 A: and you know you don't 

262.86 264.01 A: go ahead 

263.39 265.80 B: oh no i oh no you go ahead [laughter] 

265.62 271.71 A: i was just going to say you know you don't wanna be racist or anything but it's kinda scary you're like okay you know 

271.75 278.61 B: oh i know it's [laughter] you can't help but do the little racial profiling [sigh] thing 

279.11 279.76 A: right 

279.64 281.14 B: yeah we know who 

281.15 284.03 B: generally we're kinda looking for 

283.58 285.02 A: right 

284.40 292.17 B: um i think that if a private company was in charge of security rather than the government i'd feel better 

292.59 297.08 B: because at least it would be competitive and you know they'd have to do 

292.77 293.38 A: (( mm )) 

297.05 298.27 A: right 

297.52 298.91 B: you know instead of 

299.13 303.09 B: you know just the typical gov- you don't work for the government do you 

303.17 303.95 A: no 

303.77 306.30 B: (( government worker [laughter] you know what i mean )) 

305.51 306.74 A: (( no [laughter] )) 

307.13 308.21 B: so 

307.77 309.05 A: yeah 

308.60 311.28 B: in that way i don't know how much 

311.80 323.71 B: safer it really is ex- unless you know it's just been a deterrent because they've already done the big airplane incident and now they're gonna look for other ways to 

320.53 321.78 A: right 

323.85 325.83 B: do something horrible 

325.98 335.17 A: right and it's and it's hard because they have all this security as far as whether you uh you know could pull up to the curb or not and 

334.53 335.98 B: mhm 

335.74 338.97 A: when we uh flew when i flew um 

339.03 343.26 A: late february early march they were on high alert 

343.36 348.51 A: so you couldn't even pull up to the curb they were checking cars as you drove into the airport 

348.40 349.77 B: oh really 

349.39 352.81 A: so i mean before you ever even stepped 

352.81 354.60 A: you know a foot onto 

354.50 368.05 A: where the terminals were you were they were searching cars and that kinda stuff so that that made me feel a little secure at least they were searching the cars so that nobody could you know just drive a car up there and just leave it 

357.89 359.19 B: oh wow 

364.16 365.45 B: right 

367.40 369.63 B: right oh that's good 

368.23 379.08 A: and they get really yeah they get really really um up tight if you park too long when you're even when you're just picking people up i don't know i don't know if they figure you know 

376.13 377.24 B: (( mm )) 

379.58 384.91 A: that somebody's gonna sit there for a while and you know have a car bomb or whatever but 

384.02 385.23 B: mhm 

385.33 387.42 A: you know i i don't know i 

387.81 392.48 A: i still think that uh like you said the marshalls would be the best idea 

392.21 395.14 B: i do too i mean they're there 

395.24 403.26 B: you know it's just if the world's come to that then i mean with all these international flights and people who can connect from here to there 

403.15 404.31 A: (( b- right )) 

403.95 406.86 B: you know especially that 

406.62 410.53 A: right and all the disguises they could use to get on the plane 

410.13 411.91 B: oh yeah 

411.51 417.66 A: you know i mean look what they did to i mean look what they're doing to iraq in some of our military where they're you know 

417.98 420.92 A: c- coming at 'em like they're friendly and then 

419.61 421.67 B: (( [sigh] yes )) 

421.42 425.79 A: shooting 'em down so i mean it's not like you could just trust that they're 

425.59 437.00 B: nope it's they're sneaky [laughter] and they're yeah i i think and fe- you know how many people are looking for women suicide bombers you know 

429.33 430.17 A: yeah 

435.81 436.94 A: right 

437.59 438.75 B: yeah i mean 

438.07 442.46 A: probably probably not very many and that's probably what they're gonna use next 

442.11 445.87 B: right some woman dressed in a business suit you know 

446.00 448.17 B: yeah it's pretty creepy the 

448.40 462.71 B: whole thing's pretty bad i i don't you know we're taking vacations we're gonna drive to california i'd rather drive [laughter] than fly right now i guess if i had to fly i'd do it but i sure don't that 

456.37 457.45 A: yeah 

458.38 459.52 A: yeah 

462.81 466.07 B: i i didn't like to fly much before and now 

466.20 467.64 A: oh yeah 

466.96 468.08 B: you know 

468.58 475.31 A: right and then you know especially like for someone like me who lives in california the that's like a huge target 

475.05 476.56 B: i know 

476.17 478.86 A: you know it's you know they think 

477.43 480.98 B: isn't l._a._x. like the targeted airport or 

480.39 481.99 A: that's what they say 

481.55 482.97 B: yeah 

482.68 488.82 A: that's what they say it'll be the next target if there's a major thing it'll probably be l._a._x. or chicago so 

485.68 487.07 B: mhm 

488.49 489.81 B: mhm 

489.87 492.46 B: which is really scary 

490.16 491.15 A: (( you know )) 

492.57 493.72 B: (( you know )) 

493.61 498.84 A: right so i'm not i'm not convinced that all the extra stuff is 

498.86 500.87 A: extra enough [laughter] 

500.52 502.85 B: right [laughter] right 

502.95 504.76 A: might need a little bit more 

503.02 504.62 B: i agree with you 

505.07 506.89 B: i'd rather have a 

505.27 506.34 A: (( might need a )) 

507.68 510.75 A: sh- might need a little more extra 

510.26 516.64 B: mhm i know i wonder what it would take for marshalls another incident you know i mean 

516.08 521.19 A: yeah well i thought they were putting them i heard that they were putting them on some flights 

521.91 523.39 A: (( but i don't know if it )) 

521.95 523.00 B: oh really i won- 

523.64 526.13 B: mm i wonder which ones like the 

525.39 526.34 A: i don't 

527.27 530.22 B: postal ones from coast to coast or 

530.47 534.65 A: i don't know because you know people have to get into our country some way too 

534.40 535.82 B: mhm 

535.14 540.62 A: so you know are they watching the ones who c- is airport security watching the ones who are coming in 

541.47 543.49 A: you know internationally 

543.11 552.30 B: right well look at that guy they let in from london i think his name was something like richard smith but not only did he look completely crazy 

552.24 553.21 A: right 

552.24 564.69 B: and deranged and he only had a one way ticket he was i mean and i just this is where people start screaming about racial profiling but i don't care i'm sorry he looked like he was from the middle east and he looked 

560.04 561.15 A: right 

563.60 565.61 A: right with that kind of name [laughter] 

565.25 570.96 B: yeah richard smith from the middle east and he looked completely deranged a one way ticket 

571.15 574.95 B: and you know [laughter] that 

573.69 575.51 A: was he the shoe bomber guy 

575.45 576.47 B: what's that 

576.49 578.62 A: was he the shoe bomber guy 

578.42 579.47 B: um 

579.63 593.53 B: i don't remember if he was the shoe guy but he was one of 'em a while back that they they did get and he had something on him it might've been the shoe guy who was lighting his shoe on [laughter] you know my god 

591.01 592.11 A: yeah 

593.75 595.67 B: it's just crazy 

595.81 599.90 A: right and they got in a you'd think that'd be your first tip off you got somebody who looks
