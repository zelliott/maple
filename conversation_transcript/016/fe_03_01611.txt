4.26 7.77 A: my name is erica i'm from california [laughter] 

7.17 9.25 B: and i'm from oregon 

9.04 10.04 A: cool 

9.70 11.18 B: how are you this evening 

11.29 12.08 A: (( huh )) 

12.12 15.90 A: happy easter [laughter] i'm pretty good happy easter 

13.38 14.30 B: pardon 

14.49 15.83 B: pretty good 

16.12 18.35 B: [cough] do you do much flying 

18.63 22.81 A: um well not really once every couple of years 

22.31 23.43 B: (( ah )) 

23.13 24.45 A: (( what about you )) 

24.29 30.55 B: no yeah that's about the same about once every couple of years have you flown much since the nine one one 

30.51 32.94 A: no we haven't have you 

32.11 32.90 B: (( ah )) 

32.80 33.95 B: well i i 

33.75 37.79 B: have a couple of times i was scheduled to fly out the day that it happened so it 

37.37 38.50 A: oh 

37.55 52.20 B: was kind of an interesting experience [laughter] but we did fly about a month or so after it happened and and i know security was really tight at all the airports that we went through we flew from flew from oregon back to washington d._c. 

52.54 59.35 B: so we had to stop at several different airports and the security was really really weird at all the airports so 

59.25 68.12 B: i i do know that they have upped all the security and i understand now that it's just about as bad i have a friend that lives in in washington area in 

68.40 83.23 B: maryland and i talked to her a couple of weeks ago and was talking about maybe coming back there later this summer and she didn't suggest it 'cause she said that ah security was really a mess her husband works at the airport there at b._m._i. baltimat- baltim- baltimore 

74.02 74.92 A: mhm 

81.87 86.29 A: she said yesterday because it was that bad with the security 

85.65 92.44 B: right right she said it was really just a real mess it wasn't so much the safety end of it it was just that it's 

86.57 87.67 A: (( yeah )) 

92.29 98.16 B: the security is so tight and it's just such a long drawn out experience to get in and out of the airport and 

96.84 97.68 A: [laughter] 

97.76 98.69 A: wow 

97.97 107.79 B: what not so she said she wouldn't suggest it so i guess it's just as tight back there but i don't know i personally don't really think that the security really has a lot to do with the terrorism because i 

107.71 115.37 B: really think that the terrorism gets on you know they are smart enough to be able to get by get to bypass the security but 

114.84 116.01 A: yeah 

115.37 121.89 B: that's just my you know my own personal [laughter] opinion there for whatever it's worth i guess i don't know that 

118.75 120.11 A: (( i agree )) 

121.76 135.82 B: and i now the the a lot of the pilots or some of the pilots anyway are carrying guns and i don't know whether that's you know going to be a plus or a minus either that's just more opportunity to have more people get hurt should they decide to take over the plane so 

135.33 136.51 A: right 

136.00 139.39 B: who knows what makes it safe or what doesn't make it safe 

140.00 144.76 A: yeah um have they caught i think they have caught some people though 

140.08 140.94 B: (( you know )) 

144.45 145.80 B: they have 

145.23 149.17 A: ah like someone with a shoe bomb or [laughter] something like that 

147.75 161.09 B: right right right yeah they have the problem is is that so many a times is that the people that are actually doing that are the terrorists that are carrying the bombs or carrying the whatever aren't the ones that are the masterminds you know they've got their 

161.00 168.05 B: they're just the people that do it and they just really have a real morbid thought about life and it's not very important to 'em so 

167.98 177.11 B: consequently that's you need to get they need to take care of the ones that are instigating it not the ones that are actually doing it and it's hard to catch them so 

176.94 188.20 A: yeah i agree but you know terrorists i think they are trying to do like surprise attacks they- they already surprised us with the airplanes i i i doubt that they'd like strike us twice with that 

181.96 182.86 B: uh-huh 

184.54 186.10 B: right [laughter] 

187.51 199.38 B: yeah well you know it's hard to tell they have some weird weird ways of thinking for sure but maybe since we've done all of our our damage or done all of our good whatever you want to call it in iraq well maybe they've 

199.29 208.75 B: will decide that we really mean you know we're really serious about the terrorists and and they will leave us alone for a while at least that's all we can do is hope anyway and 

208.30 210.34 A: yeah i hope so [laughter] 

208.54 220.25 B: but i don't i don't think that the tighter security really does make a really big difference to to the terrorists i think they're going to do whatever they're going to do because like i say they just don't have a real value on life and 

220.14 224.99 B: and they get real brainwashed as to what they think is the best for their own personal 

224.92 231.30 A: yeah i mean yeah they do plan out so if there is tighter security they'd make plans for that 

230.90 232.89 B: that's true very true 

231.70 232.62 A: (( um )) 

233.57 234.59 B: very very true 

233.64 240.82 A: i am going to get on a plane in san francisco to go to hawaii ah in like two weeks 

238.47 239.27 B: (( oh )) 

240.42 241.32 B: oh 

240.79 255.28 A: or so so i'm excited about that we have to get there they say three hours early and my mom always used to make us get there like two hours early so it won't be too much of a difference but i'll see how tight the security is 

242.71 243.92 B: yeah 

246.08 247.04 B: oh 

250.30 251.52 B: right 

254.86 260.58 B: right right yeah it will be interesting i think a lot of it too makes a difference as to where the plane's going 

260.59 265.00 B: you know if it's going like like going to hawaii i wouldn't think that there would be a real 

261.23 262.32 A: yeah 

264.93 278.97 B: you know a real too much of a danger anyway i hope no danger at all for your sake but i wouldn't really think the danger would be too high going to hawaii but where they're going you know going like into washington d._c. or into one of the bigger airports you know that's probably where 

269.17 269.89 A: (( yes )) 

275.54 276.50 A: yeah 

278.95 281.29 B: your danger really is but 

281.04 282.23 A: yeah 

281.64 291.07 B: yeah it's it's it's hard to tell you know i just kind of believe that you you're going to go when you're going to go and if it's if that's the way you're going to go well that's the way you're going to go you know i 

289.44 290.59 A: [laughter] 

291.03 292.02 A: yeah 

291.06 300.49 B: don't think it really makes much difference but but i i i you know i i know that they are trying to make it safer and so that's all you can do is i guess give 'em a 

293.53 294.50 A: yeah 

300.67 303.34 B: chance to try and make it as safe as possible 

302.91 304.05 A: well 

303.54 304.30 B: so 

304.24 311.14 A: but the fact was i'm trying to make it safer i think it could be tougher for the terrorists to plan another 

310.82 311.70 B: true 

311.37 314.77 A: ah attack say on with the airplanes 

314.20 315.86 B: yeah it might 

314.82 318.65 A: so that's good as tougher as we can make it the better [laughter] 

318.06 327.75 B: yeah they might think twice about it too you know may not not be so cocky about what they're going to do and really think seriously about about it before they do it so 

327.77 331.50 B: that would make a make a good id- good sense to 'em 

331.25 337.14 A: yeah i i i don't think they have the right um perception of what america is [laughter] 

335.27 346.11 B: no they don't they don't no my son in law is from turkey and i have our ex son in law i should say but he he has a real different idea on 

342.44 343.65 A: (( mm yeah )) 

346.31 357.39 B: on life in general and and really on the family and just on a lot of things and when you have somebody like that that's in a member of your family basically you kinda see where they're 

357.68 366.29 B: not really where they're coming from but you can kinda better understand i think their their philosophy you know if they don't like he's been here 

366.16 367.02 A: yeah 

366.36 371.56 B: about oh god i guess he's been here about seven years 

371.34 372.69 A: mhm 

371.87 378.77 B: almost seven years now and i can see where he's changed a lot but i can still see every now and then his 

378.66 389.77 B: his heritage kind of creeps back into his attitudes of of life in general you know and they just really the family and and the family especially is just not important to those people 

389.26 390.40 A: really 

389.78 396.28 B: and it's just it's really sad that they can just life is just not an important thing you know 

396.30 399.60 B: and so that's why the terror- that's a lot of times 

396.39 397.42 A: (( wow )) 

398.50 407.53 A: i know they have different culture and beliefs and like they serve purposes in their culture but sometimes they don't fit into ours and it's hard to see their point of view 

400.91 401.80 B: uh-huh 

405.36 406.18 B: right 

407.22 408.12 B: right 

407.77 421.00 A: i've i've talked with some people from you know different countries and yeah you know the american guy just don't go with their values but it's their culture and like i guess it provides them with 

416.30 417.20 B: (( uh-huh )) 

421.11 425.46 A: structure in their society and with their tradition or something so 

422.99 423.99 B: right 

424.96 426.85 B: right are you a student 

426.45 429.79 A: um i go to college yes [laughter] 

428.15 429.07 B: mm 

429.90 433.35 B: but you don't so do you have there in california 

433.25 434.55 A: yes 

433.87 437.42 B: yeah so do you have a lot of other international students 

437.58 439.14 A: um we have some 

437.61 439.61 B: in your classes do you 

439.68 449.57 A: um i i can't think of many though i've like one person from china and one person from france that's all i know 

449.18 450.20 B: (( mm )) 

450.58 452.62 B: so not really any that are from the 

452.63 454.68 B: any of the arab countries that 

454.54 458.23 A: yeah i i'm just going to a community college we do have um 

454.88 456.33 B: would have a terrorist 

458.36 469.20 A: arab people at our college i know it's changed for them oh yeah just like security you know how they get singled out sometimes or supposedly but 

460.55 461.63 B: (( mhm )) 

467.51 468.47 B: right 

469.11 473.52 A: i know i know that's wrong with ah you know we have 

473.64 483.13 A: value like our american values are we're not supposed to discriminate based on race and stuff but i i think i can understand where that's coming from because they fit the profile 

483.05 484.67 B: right right 

483.51 485.14 A: yeah 

484.88 495.43 B: right but i know that that the one time like i say we did fly just right after it and i swear every time i turned around they were making me stop and take off my shoes and you know stand up 

493.53 496.82 A: (( really it's going to be that bad huh )) 

496.15 503.70 B: yeah with my arms stand you know out to my side and you know and i'm like sixty years old so it's not 

497.60 499.50 A: (( it's going to be tiring )) 

503.61 516.34 B: it's not like [cough] i was a typical terrorist that's for sure you know and very very caucasian and very you know definitely no doubt in anybody's mind should be that i definitely was a wholehearted american so 

507.38 508.40 A: (( yes )) 

515.72 517.00 A: [laughter] 

516.35 522.57 B: but i did it seemed like every ti- every airport we went through i had to get the supreme check out you know and 

522.04 523.30 A: wow 

522.48 527.58 B: so when you say you know you hear about them profiling and you you want to make you want to think 

527.46 537.88 B: exactly what profiling are you talking about you know but i'm sure that some people feel like that they are you know are profiled against or you know set into the profile 

530.54 531.52 A: yeah 

536.34 539.43 A: i've seen some articles about it 

538.84 542.69 B: right right i have too without any doubt so
