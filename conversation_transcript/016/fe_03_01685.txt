103.70 104.80 A: well 

105.27 117.47 A: i i don't think so i think we're going to stay over there a long time to straighten it out to rebuild it and i have i actually have a nephew over there that um they said they're going to be over there a whole 'nother year so 

117.40 124.05 A: um at least until the end of the year and into the following year so i think it's going to be a very long process 

117.65 118.77 B: yeah 

123.42 131.36 B: well i have several friends that over there have husbands that are over there so it is this really bad thing a lot of people missing a lot of family 

131.02 134.02 A: yeah they really are i mean i [mn] 

134.21 143.34 A: i guess i can see why we went over there but sometimes it's kind of confusing and then it's confusing for kids i have a sixteen year old that's really 

143.18 155.24 A: um was uptight over the whole thing because you know they started writing all those warnings and she was afraid we were going to get bombed and you know it was like it was hard to explain you know 

154.81 158.23 B: yeah it really is they did all the procedures at school here too 

155.72 156.53 A: becau- 

157.88 165.04 A: well see they didn't do nothing at our school you know you just heard it on c._n._n. and they blasted c._n._n. in every class you know 

160.74 161.40 B: (( mhm )) 

164.82 173.39 A: but they didn't prepare them for it you know and so they thought we were probably you know they were you know they really didn't know what to expect so 

173.15 180.13 A: i mean you hate to tell them no nothing like that can happen because it could you know you don't want to misguide your kids but 

177.62 178.59 B: yeah 

180.25 182.56 A: she was a little confused so 

182.59 196.19 A: i don't know but did you hear that i asked my sister about this yesterday um did you hear about that when they posted or hung the united states flag over uh saddam when they pulled him over and it was hung upside down did you hear that 

192.39 193.88 B: yeah 

195.41 196.60 B: mhm 

196.46 204.35 A: well i haven't heard nothing more about it i mean he was on larry king that kid was and he was ordered to do that 

199.49 200.39 B: no they 

204.04 205.41 B: mhm 

204.75 219.49 A: and he was never reprimanded for it because it's like his captain told him to do it bu- but you know i wonder i mean that means they are in dire need they're in need of help send more help what is that all about have you heard any more or 

209.10 210.21 B: yeah 

218.96 225.15 B: no i haven't heard anything the only thing i've seen on that is them pulling it down that's all they showed here 

224.70 226.25 A: yeah yeah 

225.42 228.16 B: that was that was about all i got out of it 

227.54 234.37 A: yeah 'cause they put he put it up and he took a lot of time putting it up and put it upside down stars side down 

234.20 247.99 A: and then took it down left it there for a few seconds took it down and then put up i guess like the new iraqi flag or something or the old one because there was a new one made when i don't know saddam came in or something so he put that one back up uh 

240.70 242.17 B: mhm 

246.88 248.44 B: mhm 

248.09 253.58 A: th- the older one so i wondered about that because that was just really weird 

252.91 257.22 B: yeah it was it was really strange i thought the same thing yeah and 

254.59 255.48 A: yeah 

256.15 264.81 A: i just wondered if they felt like they were in danger you know so maybe they thought there was bigger cells there than there really was you know 

264.79 275.12 A: of those militants and stuff but it sounds like they got everything under control i mean it's like the war is over now and now on on c._n._n. it's it's called like rebuilding in 

275.65 284.87 A: rebuilding what is it now they're saying rebuilding iraq or something like that but nothing hardly anything with the war now it's all about rebuilding and so 

285.24 286.30 A: (( i don't know )) 

286.80 290.59 B: [noise] yeah and and i tell you have you sign 

290.61 294.04 B: the p._o._w. thing that was on the other night from texas 

293.67 295.89 A: oh where they got to come home 

295.66 296.91 B: yeah 

296.32 299.30 A: yeah that was really touching i tell you what 

298.19 298.84 B: tha- 

298.98 301.86 B: yeah that was really nice i thought that was real sweet 

301.37 303.54 A: yeah it was and now um 

303.31 305.53 A: it was it was kind of um 

305.38 318.80 A: i i didn't realize it but i got thinking about it after i'd seen it you know heard about this but i went to school for psychology and i never gave it any thought but you know they said when them p._o._w.s are together like that for a long time 

318.71 322.53 A: they get so trusting of each other they don't want to separate 

322.33 323.47 B: yeah 

322.44 334.27 A: and um there was a problem when they were in the hospital you know they didn't want to be separated they wanted to be with one another and it i would see it being hard to separate because you're thinking you're going to die 

334.22 345.27 A: and they're the last people you know faces that you can trust with you and so i was like wow you know i never gave that a thought that they would bond so strongly you know 

344.97 346.55 B: mhm 

345.27 355.85 A: so i bet that was hard for them to go home and leave them because they kept one another safe and kept one another going and then going home to your family would be tough 

355.27 358.22 B: yeah it would be tough it'd be it'd be a mental strain 

357.85 359.81 A: yeah it really would 

359.14 366.79 B: the just like the girl jessica that got all that stuff done to her can you imagine having to come back over here and trying to deal with all this 

366.04 368.72 A: oh my goodness no no 

367.77 380.35 B: and they're just they're just over bundling her with stuff you know people are writing i'm sure and you know and all kinds of stuff coming in the mail you know she's getting just a bunch of stuff and i mean she deserves it 

373.09 374.30 A: yeah 

379.41 388.16 A: yeah w- that's where um you know they've been discussing this bit and i listen to coast to coast and they got it on there quite a little bit 

387.97 397.22 A: the a._m. radio you know they've been talking about having even that's the problem they say about putting women on the front line because the men get really protective 

397.05 411.53 A: of the women because they know the dangers of being in these kind of countries like you know w- where we're at right now it's because they're savages you know saddam's boys himself themselves were you know horrible guys i mean they 

411.56 418.11 A: kill and rape and everything and that's the problem they're getting into now is actually putting these women 

417.94 429.74 A: in harm's way like this because um so much more can happen to them psychologically i think than guys you know is what they're saying i don't know i know i wouldn't be the same ever the same 

422.47 423.86 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

429.68 435.29 A: uh i mean er you know when you get your dignity taken from you like she did i'm sure you know 

434.61 435.90 B: oh yeah 

435.72 448.03 A: i mean it wasn't just being beat on and stuff i'm i'm sure they went you know further than that and that's where they get this deal where they're afraid of putting women up there any more because of this problem so 

436.08 436.66 B: (( [noise] )) 

448.71 450.79 A: but i don't know it's 

449.94 463.88 B: it ain't easy being a mama i couldn't see them do the children and the women and stuff like they're doing over there you know you know just pulling the kids out in front of them to to keep from having to get shot themselves and i just i don't think the 

455.23 456.35 A: oh 

461.51 462.29 A: (( yes )) 

463.95 469.17 B: i don't think the mental strain on me would be enough for them to pay me a billion dollars to deal with it 

468.77 471.07 A: no no i don't think so 

469.62 479.34 B: i couldn't handle the children thing and it [noise] it it would just kill me it wou- i couldn't handle seeing a little baby shot or even an older child 

473.88 475.51 A: yeah it would 

478.60 490.17 A: no no a- anybody 'cause i've always been a reactor so um [noise] uh y- that's the deal [noise] and i i would probably get killed myself before you know what i mean 

489.74 490.98 B: yeah 

490.39 498.41 A: 'cause it would just be horrible because i've heard that where they they'll actually kill the kid in front of them and then kill the parent you know 

496.72 497.42 B: [noise] 

497.84 499.19 B: yeah 

498.47 511.05 A: and then i heard they run them through wood choppers or something like that some of these people and then did you see where they actually found all those um coffins and stuff in that one uh 

499.82 500.45 B: (( [noise] )) 

503.28 504.86 B: mhm 

508.74 511.43 B: (( [noise] )) 

511.14 521.31 A: what is what was it like a warehouse or something they were lined like five high all the way across i was like boy you'd think they could at least bury the poor souls you know 

514.05 515.64 B: mhm 

521.00 522.92 B: it's almost like hitler 

522.41 525.91 A: yeah like they were keeping them for trophies or something 

525.10 535.63 B: yeah it's it's so sickening to think that uh you know at least we haven't had to bring it over here we're just really lucky i think that americans haven't had to deal with that on their own soil 

531.20 532.97 A: yeah exactly 

535.04 536.36 A: yeah 

536.30 541.29 B: we're just we've been really lucky all these years god knows that it might not keep happening 

541.07 542.36 A: yeah 

541.69 545.27 B: but hopefully we will be able to keep them over there 

543.96 552.20 A: well that's the deal i- i've mixed feelings about is um these people i can understand why people didn't want us to invade but 

552.03 565.53 A: on the other hand i understand why we did it first of all it's inhumane to allow people that's how i feel this is how i feel i guess i should say inhumane to allow people to continue to be treated like that just on that basis alone 

563.33 564.98 B: mhm 

565.34 579.25 A: not including the fact that we were in danger because of the possible chemical weapons and everything you know that was going on and the links to al qaeda but you know that alone but then you have these people who are like wasting their time 

579.23 585.47 A: picketing and parading against this war even after it was going on still 

585.46 599.95 A: doing this and i was like what is going on here there is nothing you can do now it's started it's done it's a done deal it's just wa- quit wasting your energy doing this let's support these people you know now they wonder how they figure out how they got the freedom 

585.56 586.90 B: mhm 

596.62 597.34 B: (( [noise] )) 

598.47 599.02 B: (( [noise] ))
