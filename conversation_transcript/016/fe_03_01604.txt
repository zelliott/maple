11.92 14.34 A: oh hi sharon i'm uh here in texas 

14.29 15.92 B: in texas oh great 

15.29 16.50 A: (( yeah )) 

16.30 19.08 B: okay what is the topic i didn't catch that real quick 

18.42 27.28 A: it was about airport security does uh increasing airport security lessen the chance of terr- a terrorist attack or a hijacking or something like that yeah i didn't get it too 

26.81 31.20 B: okay that's what i kind of thought it was but i wasn't real positive how do you feel about that 

31.26 38.59 A: well i mean i i like i like the i like at least most of the effects i mean i i don't like some of the effects that it's taken on 'cause 

38.74 40.77 A: really the whole the whole 

40.60 54.99 A: airline industry has gone down 'cause of all this heightened security and increased fares and you know all this all these taxes that've been added on for the nine eleven fees and and such so but i think i think it in the end it does make us safer so i mean 

55.14 58.43 B: and i think it does i think it does scare some of 'em 

55.49 56.16 A: (( i g- )) 

58.80 72.69 A: it does scare some of 'em off exactly and it just shows 'em but i guess that just gives them more time to plan maybe so um i guess i it's it's a good thing actually i mean all these all these steps that are i i'm willing to pay 

72.89 74.27 A: a small price 

74.49 78.18 A: for for my safety especially in in in an airplane 

78.67 81.08 B: (( [noise] evidently right because there's )) 

80.68 81.74 A: yeah [sigh] 

81.34 88.93 B: [laughter] right [laughter] we understand that [laughter] there's no way of fleeing that 

89.07 94.09 B: uh you're right except that one time when we went on the plane all they searched our luggage and everything 

94.03 95.24 A: (( mhm )) 

94.26 100.02 B: and and when we got to our destination um my husband looked in the side pocket and here was a little tiny jack knife 

100.33 107.62 B: that they hadn't even found and so sometimes but then that's been like two years ago so i think since then that their security has been uh 

100.64 101.51 A: uh-huh 

103.26 104.34 A: well 

107.63 112.28 B: upgraded a whole lot i mean they've got people now that are know what they're doing and looking for and then 

108.70 109.49 A: well 

111.82 119.34 A: yeah exactly before that you had people that i could do a better job if you [laughter] if you just give me the right training so and 

118.56 119.57 B: right 

119.61 123.16 A: most half of 'em don't even speak english so i mean you know they're 

123.69 128.07 B: it was whoever they could hire and now i think it's it's stepped up a whole lot more 

123.78 124.99 A: i mean at least 

127.11 133.64 A: and definitely higher standards now and i mean that's a good thing i mean the whole security department i think it's a it's 

133.93 136.52 A: it might not be the it might not be 

136.43 141.29 B: convenient it's not convenient for a person and it's more expensive 

136.59 137.46 A: (( you know )) 

137.51 138.96 A: convenient but 

141.13 147.33 A: definitely and i think that's that might be a little that might be a prob- i think that's the big problem right now on all these airli- 

147.41 157.57 A: airli- yeah yeah these big airlines like american delta united they're filing filing for bankruptcy 'cause of just heightened security measures you don't people don't want to wait two hours [mn] 

157.77 164.63 A: in the airport terminal just to just to get strip searched or you know or the bag xrayed or something like that 

164.51 165.76 B: mhm 

164.81 169.62 A: and and it's sad that a lot of these a lot of these 

168.41 170.38 B: we had to go to these 

170.52 173.83 B: extent it's sad that we had to go to this extent 

170.70 171.49 A: (( 'scuse me )) 

173.71 178.57 A: yeah and that we do have sometimes have to profile and i mean 

179.00 184.87 A: i mean that's that's kind of sad but i think i think it's they're not doing the wrong thing [laughter] 

184.69 185.54 B: no 

185.27 189.42 A: profiling people but i just 

187.24 193.43 B: i appreciate the precautions and you just have to pardon me you have to what 

190.49 192.25 A: i just hope it doesn't yeah 

193.35 198.26 A: i just hope it doesn't it doesn't go too far with people's people's individual rights you know 

198.64 205.39 A: but other than that i think you you might have to you might have to discriminate just a bit to help us out [laughter] help 

205.70 207.93 A: help the general cause out [laughter] 

207.96 208.89 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

208.94 209.92 A: maybe 

209.78 214.82 B: and and i notice they make a lot more people take their shoes off now and just check their shoes and 

210.14 211.41 A: (( it's a sad thing )) 

214.24 216.95 A: oh yeah mhm especially 

215.97 218.66 B: their computers and everything and uh 

219.50 225.26 B: it's like i say it's inconvenient but i just appreciate the precaution and at least 

226.28 233.19 B: and they're searching here in minnesota they search a lot of cars when you come into the airport so that's that's not really convenient so it's 

233.42 237.00 B: you know it takes longer so you you have to plan so much further ahead 

237.08 237.96 B: (( you know )) 

238.32 247.15 A: mhm definitely definitely i give myself at least two hours and i'm just flying from dallas to houston or dallas to austin and i give myself two hours so 

238.97 240.60 B: more time but 

247.36 255.99 A: it is getting before i used to have to you know just go thirty minutes before you know just to make sure that if i run into traffic or anything huh [cough] 

255.43 261.15 B: now i've been to houston quite a few times to the airport there and that's really huge do they do a lot of precautions there 

261.01 263.66 A: um actually 

263.92 272.18 A: dallas is i think i think is worse [laughter] 'cause dallas is i think it's like it's a really busy airport and so like 

266.83 267.97 B: oh really 

272.70 280.39 A: so that you have a lot of you have a lot of uh transfers and incoming flights more than you know more than uh flights leaving so 

278.07 279.69 B: mhm 

280.50 284.63 A: [cough] i think i think i don't know they they just make sure 

285.14 288.12 A: they just make sure that that i don't know 

288.70 299.63 A: there's i heard something that their the safety record is really bad dallas fort worth so i think they've they've really stepped it up so but yeah dallas is i think much worse than houston [laughter] 

299.97 302.20 B: right i i i do think they 

303.01 307.30 B: could be a lot [mn] you know check a lot better than they do but 

308.48 310.75 B: then i guess we pay a bigger price again too 

310.85 311.63 B: [mn] 

311.01 321.22 A: yeah yeah all these fares are going up [mn] i mean i i remember i bought a ticket and it's like nine dollars for nine eleven fee and it's expensive [laughter] 

320.66 321.56 B: right 

321.46 324.96 A: pretty so it's a pretty heavy tax [laughter] right there so 

323.76 324.83 B: [laughter] 

325.09 326.22 A: i mean 

326.29 328.91 A: if i mean i guess 

329.57 334.77 A: i don't know where that money goes so [laughter] i just hope it's going in the right hands so 

335.19 336.16 A: (( it's just )) 

335.57 342.49 B: well they're laying so many people off at north west i was you know i don't know if but then i suppose there aren't that many people flying like they used to be either 

342.29 346.10 A: yeah definitely oh i it's it's it's pretty bad 

345.07 346.04 B: but i suppo- 

346.45 350.40 B: i suppose that nine dollars is going to pay for all this extra security so 

350.76 352.44 A: let's just hope it does [sigh] the 

352.23 353.12 B: yeah 

352.50 355.51 A: government doesn't always have the best track record in 

355.54 356.63 A: accounting 

355.73 360.51 B: and how do you how do you feel about the pilots now they were showing last night on the t._v. here in minnesota that 

360.55 364.92 B: uh they were showing 'em how to um target shoot and carry guns and 

365.46 372.67 A: well i think i well from what i hear a good majority of the pilots are navy trained are from the navy 

372.38 373.57 B: oh they are 

372.84 373.55 A: so 

373.44 388.08 A: yeah that's what it that's w- it's something it's a really big number actually it's it's most of the pilots a- actually and so like i mean i i mean they've they've had the training they've they've had the field tr- training in the navy or or airforce or something like that so 

388.08 395.86 A: i mean i can i can trust them i can trust the pilots you know they're s- they're soldiers they're ex soldiers i guess i mean if you want to call 'em that but 

395.45 396.66 B: mhm 

396.28 400.05 A: they've been trained in this kind of stuff in killing so i mean 

400.25 408.37 A: let's just hope they don't miss [laughter] you know they don't shoot a window out let's just hope that but other than that i i mean i trust them i trust them with guns i mean 

402.55 404.31 B: [laughter] 

409.21 412.74 A: [sigh] let's just let's hope they n- never have to use it but 

413.07 414.25 B: (( right )) 

416.53 420.61 B: oh i don't know what they what else they could do to step up this security um 

421.11 424.54 A: i think i think right now is the safest time to travel but [sigh] 

425.32 426.44 B: oh you do think 

425.34 435.60 A: especially especially i mean especially after all after we what we saw in nine eleven [laughter] i mean this is it just i think i think 

435.82 440.52 A: in- including all this heightened security and and uh 

441.23 443.19 A: and just overall awareness 

443.31 448.51 A: i think it just makes us safer a little bit more safer in the air than we were 

448.58 452.05 A: ni- september tenth two thousand and one i think 

452.39 459.64 A: but i mean there's always a chance there's al- there are people out there that believe in their cause and they they really don't care 

459.71 463.02 A: how they get their job done but they just get it done so 

463.15 464.21 B: mhm 

463.40 465.45 A: i think that's a bigger problem [laughter] 

466.11 467.09 A: not the 

466.35 470.24 B: they're just showing on the t._v. here right now the pilots um target 

472.14 474.77 A: oh really what is it a._b._c. c._n._n. 

476.33 481.21 B: what is channel four here i don't even know no it's it's our local station so 

480.61 482.27 A: oh it's a local station 

481.93 483.50 B: mhm 

482.65 483.63 A: okay 

484.09 486.18 A: (( [noise] that would've been interesting )) 

488.16 490.99 B: but the pilot's union is what are they saying about us 

491.63 492.43 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

494.46 495.51 A: [noise] 

494.75 501.95 B: oh forty five pilot- [noise] only forty five pilots are certified to um carry guns for north west 

497.27 498.19 A: (( [noise] )) 

502.01 506.69 A: oh really and it's out of how many pilots do you if you know 

502.97 504.20 B: mhm 

506.61 508.32 B: it 

508.79 514.68 B: [noise] it doesn't say or i mean i can barely hear it 'cause i've got it turned on so low [laughter] so uh 

509.91 510.91 A: (( doesn't say )) 

512.37 513.14 A: huh 

515.39 521.66 A: but that's surprises me i think i think more pilots would have gun training at least if they were trained in the navy but 

522.49 526.42 A: i mean i trust i trust them i mean that's just another that's just another 

526.84 530.14 A: addition to one of their jobs so the job so 

530.70 535.26 A: i'm willing to pay a little extra just to feel a little just have that peace of mind i guess 

536.49 540.08 B: like i said in the beginning i think they probably make 

537.29 538.10 A: in that 

540.52 546.61 B: who's ever going to do it think twice before they uh hijack or whatever and 

545.49 550.62 A: exactly definitely air marshalls i think air marshalls is a very good thing to have too 

551.14 558.23 A: that'd be that'd make me feel that'd give me at least some really really big sense of security i guess 

558.71 566.55 A: but i think that that costs way too much if you had it on every flight so i think they need a maybe like cross country flight you know 

567.38 575.25 A: cross continent continental flights maybe that that'd be wise but maybe little flights from dallas to austin you know thirty minutes 

575.07 580.14 B: but i guess the sad thing is when when we used to go to the airport your family could go to the 

575.49 578.07 A: i don't think that'd be wise [noise] 

580.31 582.89 B: right to the terminal with you practically 

580.75 581.52 A: (( [noise] )) 

582.03 583.81 A: inside the terminal yeah 

583.23 584.87 B: yes and now it's 

586.05 589.86 A: yeah we can't even park you know within a hundred feet of the terminal so 

586.27 588.42 B: leave you at the door and that's it 

589.02 590.82 B: [laughter] 

589.93 592.56 A: it's really inconvenient now yeah 

592.12 593.28 B: (( right )) 

592.63 595.66 A: let's just hope these airlines can get it together and 

595.81 597.07 B: (( well i don't know much )) 

596.05 598.16 A: help our economy out there 

598.48 599.95 B: yeah i mean if they start going
