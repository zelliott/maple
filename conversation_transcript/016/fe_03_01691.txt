219.48 221.53 A: it it's way too hard 

221.48 224.08 B: it's it's just hard you know it's 

225.26 227.41 B: i'm glad they're doing it 

227.49 229.18 B: but it's just 

231.00 234.23 B: i know the suffering over there's horrible 

233.77 234.74 A: mhm 

234.87 240.87 B: and it it you know if we were in that same boat we'd want someone to try to help us 

239.94 242.18 A: yeah 

242.25 245.91 B: but the religion part gets in the way with ah [noise]

288.25 297.99 A: i agree i yeah i agree exactly i'm just on the same wavelength as you are you know it's gonna get worse before it gets better and it's only another stage in the whole process mhm

300.90 303.45 B: if we were over there with our children 

304.61 306.19 A: i can't even imagine 

304.63 307.69 B: you know that's the only thing that 

307.80 312.15 B: i think about is is i know that the lord is you know god is

317.12 318.88 A: mhm
