0.93 3.14 A: hello this is angela 

2.64 5.01 B: hi this is sherrie how are you 

4.57 6.01 A: good how are you 

5.34 6.68 B: [laughter] i'm fine 

6.29 7.40 A: good 

6.87 16.43 B: yeah great well i guess our topic of the day is the middle east [laughter] uh did you hear some of the suggestions that they mentioned i have my opinion i think 

10.73 11.80 A: okay 

15.56 19.46 A: well yeah i heard a couple of the things do you wanna go ahead and start 

18.61 20.12 B: (( no you go ahead to start )) 

19.92 29.55 A: okay well um personally i think at this point i think it was necessary for the united states to go in um i think they needed we needed to i 

26.66 27.47 B: mhm 

29.59 40.93 A: i think we're gonna ultimately find out that um there were a number of issues not o- not only weapons that were being hidden but i think a lot of the like the graves that were uncovered a lot of uh 

40.94 53.59 A: humanitarian issues that really needed to be uncovered and brought out in order to help the people um however at this point i think that at the same time we need to allow 

42.55 43.79 B: mhm 

53.52 59.10 A: the their country to set up the type of democracy that they want and 

57.19 57.99 B: mhm 

59.11 67.75 A: kind of go over there and kind of be the sounding board and kinda like mum and dad and just kinda watch but we have to let the kids go at that point 

67.38 82.13 B: okay well i disagree um you know i i think we needed to be over there but i think we in there for the wrong reasons and i don't see any proof of any weapons of mass destruction yet i think we can ar- you know we can be a little overpowering 

82.40 88.41 B: i think there were some um human rights issues with um saddam hussein 

88.64 96.99 B: and things like that and so you you probably need to get tyrants out but as far as coming over and occupying the country and and doing the whole um 

97.19 107.67 B: just the way that we did it um i think it's i think it's wrong i think [laughter] we- well you know we threatened them first with what they call a preemptive strike we're trying to prevent 

105.80 106.66 A: right 

107.59 115.69 B: something worse from happening or you know or we're giving uh um getting um what is that um those chemical weapons 

115.44 117.53 A: right weapons of mass destruction 

115.87 117.17 B: being yeah 

117.02 121.34 B: over here and and things like that but you know we said look you know 

121.11 134.96 B: we're gonna come over there and if you don't turn over all these weapons we're gonna do x. y. and z and i'm thinking you know if i was this person i wouldn't give up my weapons you know i i'm being threatened but i don't really think they have the capability to have as much as 

135.02 137.81 B: we are hearing that they have so 

137.93 150.84 B: and i'm pretty sure a lot of this you know it's media and we probably don't know everything that's going on we're only told a little bit about you know everything that happens in even in the middle east or any other kind of um you know international issues 

150.47 156.46 A: i don't think it's just international i think it's also in this country that everything's not told also 

152.34 152.98 B: (( mm )) 

156.02 157.44 B: mhm 

156.83 162.03 A: so yeah i mean to a certain extent i think we i think we did allow 

162.04 163.89 A: you know we gave 'em fair 

163.90 173.82 A: the way i look at it we gave 'em fair warning that you know basically if you don't you know saddam turn yourself in let us come in you know you take out 

170.69 171.72 B: mhm 

174.01 183.05 A: kinda one of those things of when i ask my kids a question and they don't really wanna answer and they don't wanna open up their room kinda thinking okay there's something in there you don't want me seeing 

176.59 177.55 B: mhm 

179.65 180.48 B: mhm 

182.56 184.24 B: mhm 

183.60 185.08 A: and you know 

185.11 190.25 A: at the same time there's some human rights i mean the women over there were just being 

189.80 191.96 B: i i agree with you on that score 

190.92 192.43 A: oh my gosh there's 

191.98 197.91 B: you know well well just the killing people and they did find evidence of of mass graves so 

196.95 202.86 A: right and evidently the sons were especially one of 'em was just a real 

198.13 199.08 B: but 

202.47 203.26 B: (( [mn] )) 

202.94 204.11 A: twit 

203.31 217.69 B: yeah and he was torturing people and and the like but so did you know we've got idi amin we've got castro we've got you know everybody and you know there's the whole situation in africa where they're cutting off people's arms and legs and um and we don't 

215.20 229.14 A: well that's what i mean i don't of course middle east is not the only place it's happening and that's what at the same time i think you know maybe we need to go back and say okay now we let you guys go now where else do we need to look at and see 

219.75 220.96 B: yeah 

228.10 229.14 B: mhm 

229.20 238.23 A: because especially with the women and that's what's sad about the middle east is that at least in iraq the women were allowed to hold positions of 

232.95 233.75 B: mhm 

238.28 251.11 A: and learn get education and have their own positions whereas in other instances in other countries in the middle east the women are simply to be seen take care of the children cook clean 

239.76 241.61 B: uh-huh uh-huh mm 

249.76 254.12 B: i don't know if they could be seen but [laughter] probably more like heard 

251.74 258.10 A: well okay they're little black forms that are walking around that can be seen by you know husbands 

254.40 255.44 B: mhm 

257.67 258.60 B: mhm 

258.24 261.92 A: type of you know type of thing and i think that that 

259.23 260.29 B: mhm 

262.92 271.77 A: maybe we our country isn't one hundred percent right all the time but at least we have a right to say to our government we think you're wrong whereas 

264.87 265.51 B: (( mm )) 

271.69 278.76 A: you know the women aren't even allowed in many parts of the middle east to even say you know you're wrong 

278.12 281.41 B: right or vote or express an opinion b- b- 

280.41 291.48 A: right in other parts of the middle east i mean such as pakistan i mean people are simply going into places and blowing themselves up because of the religious issue which is terrifying 

287.63 288.21 B: (( [noise] )) 

288.33 296.70 B: [noise] right if you come t- well that's which which brings us to the next point now that we've come over there now you see how the clerics are fighting amongst each other 

296.25 297.28 A: mhm 

296.59 310.59 B: you know so now it's gonna be like are the shiites shiites are gonna rule um iraq is it gonna be the kurds turkey wants a little piece of this and i'm gonna say how do ya how ya gonna pick a a democratic leader now for this country how they gonna restore you know order 

300.73 301.29 A: (( [mn] )) 

310.34 311.61 A: (( that's what )) 

310.49 315.48 B: are they gonna have free elections [laughter] when you have a in with a religious country 

312.62 314.55 A: and who's gonna say they are 

315.01 324.69 A: [sigh] yep and who's gonna say that they're the free elections because no matter who loses they're gonna say it was set up just like gee just like florida 

319.50 320.54 B: mhm 

322.26 323.28 B: [laughter] 

324.08 328.55 B: mm [laughter] you think election was a set up 

328.25 336.55 A: yeah you know i mean it'll be one of those things of whoever loses is gonna is probably gonna say oh well this wasn't fair 

328.68 329.68 B: yeah 

333.31 334.52 B: mhm 

335.41 338.26 B: they right they didn't get a fair deal uh 

337.46 340.75 A: but then at the same time i would much rather have 

340.77 346.48 A: those issues being debated openly than someone saying i don't like this 

343.15 344.17 B: mhm 

346.16 347.28 B: mhm 

346.57 358.99 A: and not knowing if the next time they get into their car if it's gonna blow up or you know if their spouse is gonna turn them in for being a traitor and i think that's was what a lot of the current situation was 

350.19 352.35 B: mhm mhm 

357.41 358.41 B: mhm 

358.72 368.14 B: right and they were m- elected general topic are we ever gonna see peace in the middle east and you've got to look at israel and the way they treating the palestinians or or so 

366.27 367.50 A: oh yeah 

368.55 369.52 A: well and that's 

368.57 374.70 B: you know i and in a sort of way we're just doing this because you know we're siding with israel and 

374.82 385.34 B: and so they really kinda you know really put down the whole arab world and you know we should i really just personally think that's their country we really should stay out of their politics on this on that issue 

383.55 391.44 A: a- well but what what i think we need to go in right now and do with our military is to restore order 

390.78 392.29 B: mhm 

391.46 396.34 A: quit the looting i mean i don't want a military police situation but at the same time 

392.58 394.10 B: (( oh q- okay )) 

395.96 398.52 B: i think they're gonna have to have that to begin with 

398.18 412.39 A: yeah well [laughter] i i have a real problem with our country having museums having you know pieces of history that as far as i'm concerned belong especially egyptian pieces belong back in egypt you know 

399.32 400.59 B: (( i i [sigh] )) 

405.33 407.53 B: being looted right 

411.23 412.35 B: mhm 

412.58 415.99 A: there are african nations that we have historical 

416.14 429.41 A: art pieces that i think belong to those nations they don't belong in our museums but at the same time i wanna see i don't want joe blow out there having a piece of ancient history 

420.12 421.27 B: mhm 

427.87 433.94 B: yeah they had a lot of pieces were like before christ and like two hundred b._c. and things like that 

430.90 431.93 A: right 

432.12 433.16 A: and i think 

433.22 446.02 A: those need to be retained hey i'm all for it you know what i have no problem with them going in and you know getting chairs from the palaces that their that were bought on their backs 

444.33 445.33 B: mhm 

445.19 452.25 B: money mhm well did did you read or did you see where a lot of the um muslims had returned some of the things 

446.25 447.25 A: (( you know )) 

451.70 452.90 A: oh good 

452.05 460.95 B: they had they had brought some of the things back so that's like in their religion that's like the worst thing that they can do is like to steal that's like get your hand cut off 

453.89 455.05 A: i knew 

457.36 458.18 A: w- 

459.34 460.12 A: (( yeah )) 

460.51 466.52 A: that's what well that's what i knew a lot of the mosque have said that you know if you return 'em back to us 

466.10 467.31 B: mhm 

466.66 479.95 A: then nothing else will be done and i think that's what hopefully and i'm trying to look at the best side of it is that people were taking 'em to make sure they didn't get destroyed but on the other hand there were i mean there were items that were just destroyed 

474.82 475.54 B: mhm 

479.51 480.53 B: right 

480.06 486.13 A: and that's what's sad because that's something that will never be able to be replaced but at the same time how much 

485.33 491.90 B: exactly their feelings and that they were so oppressed this whole time you know they're they're acting out [laughter] 

488.29 489.12 A: (( oh y- you )) 

491.29 496.34 A: know it's just like it's just like our kids when we you know go away for the weekend 

495.68 497.88 B: (( [laughter] in a way [laughter] )) 

497.00 502.54 A: they go all right there's no body watch us let's go into mum and dad's room and jump on the bed 

499.29 500.42 B: [laughter] 

501.91 503.78 B: yeah yeah yeah 

502.89 512.28 A: i mean so i think it's some of it's very understandable and i really hope that we can i don't want to go in and have our government look like we're the military police 

511.30 513.12 B: mhm mhm 

512.28 526.29 A: but at the same time you can't you can't just having people run wild i think they almost have to sit up the same type of thing as what was done in new york we're saying okay look we have a curfew in in l._a. during the riots 

515.83 516.93 B: mhm 

521.28 522.40 B: mhm 

525.56 527.53 B: yeah sure sure sure 

526.66 530.51 A: saying okay we have a curfew you need to adhere to this curfew 

530.67 539.27 A: that way you're safe everyone else is safe your family's safe now let's go in there because until some order is restored we're not going to be able 

536.39 537.06 B: (( y- )) 

538.04 542.86 B: but they need a they gonna have to define a leader they gonna have to pick a leader to run their country 

542.49 543.66 A: yep 

543.06 546.66 B: and and and run it the way i'm not you know i'm i'm 

546.51 556.95 B: i consider myself very patriotic but when it comes to other countries not everybody's a democratic society and some societies work some socialisms work you know too much communism or 

556.89 568.70 B: socialized medicine and things like that but you know i don't know if it's who are we to say that democracy is the best way to run a country you know depending on the country and so 

567.51 572.85 A: well and if they can if that's the government that they chose to have just like then 

571.91 574.23 B: if they chose to have it that's what i mean 

573.78 581.93 A: then it becomes a democratic society that that's how they've chosen to have it when someone comes in and says well you vote for me or i'm gonna kill you 

577.83 578.79 B: mhm 

581.52 582.21 B: (( [laughter] )) 

581.84 595.00 A: that's not a choice and that's what i feel like a lot of the middle east not just iraq but quite a few of the middle eastern countries are doing and it's all based on who has the money who's controlling the oil fields 

586.52 587.54 B: mhm 

592.48 593.60 B: mhm 

594.55 595.55 B: sure 

595.12 598.90 A: because that's that's ninety percent of their economy 

598.18 599.95 B: yeah well you'd think we had a vested
