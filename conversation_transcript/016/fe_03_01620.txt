0.07 1.18 B: hello 

0.90 2.93 A: hi this is rich 

2.34 4.01 B: [noise] hi this is jen 

4.06 5.53 A: hi jen how are you 

5.08 8.46 B: fine how are you what state are you in i like to ask 

7.98 10.93 A: i'm in massachussetts what about you 

9.06 10.07 B: okay 

10.30 15.91 B: [noise] pennsylvania [noise] okay [noise] so for the topic god [noise] you can start [noise] 

11.17 12.43 A: i see 

15.66 19.23 A: quite an a quite a big topic to try to talk about 

17.65 19.91 B: [noise] right uh [noise] [noise] 

19.71 28.02 A: um i guess we can talk about whether or not um they'll we'll ever see peace in that area of the world what do you think 

20.92 21.73 B: (( [noise] )) 

23.89 24.55 B: [noise] 

27.28 30.53 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] i don't think so at all [laughter] um 

29.64 31.68 A: i don't i don't think so either 

30.85 31.42 B: (( [noise] )) 

31.41 44.93 B: [noise] [noise] i think it's a lost cause i think it was a waste of time in a way [noise] to go over there i think that well to go over [noise] there i think that should've happened [noise] but i think they should've just bombed it and been done with it [sigh] [noise] in a way i feel [noise] i would feel bad for 

44.78 52.37 B: you know the [noise] civilians that don't [noise] care either way but then in another way i wouldn't care [laughter] i don't know maybe i'm cold 

51.73 61.78 A: no i understand i had mixed feelings about it as well i didn't see what could really be achieved and i w- i questioned what the motives were to begin with 

62.05 66.35 A: when they talk about these weapons of mass destruction i don't even know what that is 

63.42 64.83 B: [noise] [noise] 

65.73 68.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] right exactly [noise] [noise] )) 

68.08 77.67 A: um and as far as peace in that area it looks as to me that even within any country there are so many different factions all based on different religion 

77.91 80.27 A: that i don't think they'll ever get along 

79.73 80.30 B: (( [noise] )) 

80.29 82.07 A: no matter what's done 

81.89 91.89 B: [noise] right i think they should've just [noise] well i guess they can't just bomb everything and be done with it 'cause i guess we want their oil [laughter] [noise] i guess that's a big factor too [noise] [noise] 

83.66 84.22 A: (( [sigh] )) 

88.53 90.12 A: yeah that's true 

91.35 104.91 A: i think maybe the the press makes the rest of the world looks at us as going over there for that one reason but i i i don't have any belief in that only because i think the gas prices will just do one thing and they'll continue to go up 

100.47 101.63 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

104.55 111.89 B: yeah now somewhere on a._o._l. i saw they said that the u._s. only take seventeen percent of oil from 'em anyway 

111.46 112.73 A: yeah it's n- 

111.90 114.90 B: i forget where the majority came from but 

114.35 116.29 A: i think it's mexico and canada 

116.23 122.07 B: yeah i don't remember but i was surprised to see that i thought you know like ninety percent came from there 

122.97 128.27 A: yeah it's i i bet there was a time you know a few years ago when that was probably the case 

123.18 124.49 B: so that was surprising 

128.52 130.59 A: but i think after 

130.63 132.71 A: going through a couple of those um 

132.97 139.69 A: [mn] shortages that the u._s. were smart to start looking in different areas try to get that resource 

138.04 138.96 B: right 

139.51 140.41 B: right 

141.07 151.72 A: and you know this this peace that they look for in that part of the world they haven't had it in two thousand years and and longer why do they think that it's ever gonna happen now 

152.14 157.92 A: i mean even a few weeks after it looks as if this war has come to somewhat of an ending 

158.19 162.44 A: and they're still fighting amongst themselves about how to go about 

160.57 161.61 B: right 

161.96 170.22 B: i couldn't believe the looting i saw on the news i thought if they want to be you know free liberated whatever the word was you know 

162.61 163.30 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] )) 

170.15 179.22 B: why are they then hurting themselves by looting their own stuff you know the government offices or whatever you know they even went into the museum did you see that 

174.40 175.31 A: (( mm )) 

178.66 180.15 A: yeah terrible 

179.58 186.06 B: and they took all that stuff and i thought well [sigh] i don't know i just don't understand you would think they would want that stuff to stay protected mhm 

185.83 187.77 A: well even some people 

187.97 195.70 A: even some iraqis themselves questioning to the newsmen why would our own people do this well that's a good question 

195.92 200.99 A: i s- i bet it had something to do with being so oppressed for so long 

200.91 213.82 A: and so poor that maybe they thought i mean i could see them going into the palaces and grabbing that stuff and feeling as if they but not go into the museums and and pillaging them that was terrible 

207.46 209.49 B: right yeah i could see that yeah 

210.42 211.44 B: right 

212.87 218.47 B: right that's their culture or whatever you know you would think they would want that to i don't know [laughter] 

214.15 215.52 A: yeah 

217.63 219.70 A: and it could be gone forever 

219.28 220.22 B: yeah 

220.20 222.08 A: uh it's really sad 

222.21 227.83 B: they're probably now selling it on ebay [laughter] [laughter] right exactly [laughter] 

222.37 223.16 A: um 

224.33 226.33 A: [sigh] that's the truth what isn't 

227.07 230.15 A: [laughter] [sigh] oh my it's unbelievable 

229.46 230.71 B: mhm 

230.47 233.80 A: um how many of these have you participated in already 

232.88 234.73 B: this is only my second one 

234.23 237.84 A: yeah it's only my second one as well um 

236.06 237.39 B: yeah 

238.03 243.16 A: they just go on maybe two or three is that is is three the maximum or will it just 

242.52 253.18 B: well initially i thought it was just three the maximum but then on one of the forums that i belong to they said there were a few people that said they've gotten you know quite a few like up to ten 

252.77 253.93 A: oh really 

253.34 257.74 B: yeah so maybe they have more times available on their you know 

256.80 257.83 A: i see 

258.09 263.60 A: i see w- what was your first topic that you had to talk about do you remember 

258.78 260.01 B: their profile 

262.60 267.02 B: um oh it was if you wanted to open up your own business what would it be 

266.60 269.87 A: oh really mine had something to do with uh 

267.13 268.30 B: yeah 

270.06 280.64 A: uh sports figures and how much they get paid and whether they whether they should go on strike it was kind of a weird conversation and i didn't really know where to take it 

279.83 283.35 B: yeah i wouldn't know what to say about that either 'cause i'm not into sports 

281.71 282.66 A: and 

282.82 292.34 A: this one's kinda the same thing i mean you know peace in the middle east my god if we had those answers [laughter] we'd be in a different job than uh or doing something else 

287.99 289.92 B: right [laughter] 

289.99 291.04 B: uh-huh 

291.99 293.86 B: yeah 

293.02 294.25 A: um 

294.46 295.59 A: (( [mn] the )) 

296.06 301.68 A: did when this is all done d- d- is there any questions that they ask you or anything like that 

302.10 305.74 A: or you just they just say you can hang up now or something 

305.36 309.98 B: it said um it'll come on and say you have thirty seconds left to complete your call 

309.41 310.85 A: [sigh] i see 

309.99 312.64 B: and then you just say goodbye and then that's it 

312.22 317.77 A: and do you just specify what time of day did you pick two o'clock as the time for th- for th- for you to get the call 

317.35 321.50 B: yeah well in b- i think it was like in between two and five or something 

320.50 322.35 A: [mn] oh i see 

321.88 326.34 B: so then you don't know you could get it at any time in between that timeframe 

324.73 326.12 A: oh i see 

326.15 328.70 A: i see and you are paid for this i hope 

327.75 329.98 B: yeah did you get your pay check yet 

329.43 330.93 A: no i haven't 

330.17 332.64 B: okay my first one i got a check already 

332.37 333.67 A: oh that's great 

333.19 334.58 B: yeah 

334.01 342.85 A: um i think that i opted out of being paid because i think it has something to do with the company that i work for 

342.82 343.76 B: (( oh )) 

343.36 354.61 A: and instead they asked us to waive being paid but they would put us into a pool and maybe select some winners for something or other 

351.15 352.27 B: (( oh okay )) 

354.33 355.25 B: (( oh )) 

354.86 358.16 A: so i just thought it would be the right thing to do um 

358.43 371.68 A: do the right thing for the company and just get involved but when the phone rings my first reaction is you know this is a weird phone number who's calling me and then i hear the topic and i go oh i just feel like hanging up i don't wanna [laughter] do this [sigh] 

366.36 367.42 B: [laughter] 

371.12 378.49 B: i know that's what i was thinking until they called 'cause the first call actually was like two months ago and then i haven't had any since yeah 

376.31 377.62 A: oh really 

378.01 379.50 A: oh wow 

378.58 380.17 B: so it was really odd 

380.00 383.39 A: huh well i did get a phone call um 

380.63 381.37 B: huh 

383.68 391.87 A: on friday so i thought maybe and then i forgot all about it today until i looked at the phone number and it dawned on me this had to be the same number 

391.27 392.65 B: (( mhm )) 

392.37 395.63 A: and as far as talking ten minutes on the subject is concerned 

395.86 400.40 A: it almost seems like too long a time for strangers to have to 

400.61 404.76 A: talk about something like that there's only so much you can say about it i [sigh] [sigh] 

404.03 417.73 B: right exactly i mean i don't know what else really to say about over there except for oh one thing would be why is that you know our people that they have you know had captured they were torturing they've killed you know some 

417.88 430.49 B: and yet supposedly i mean maybe i'm wrong maybe i don't know all of it but supposedly from what i heard on the news you know everybody that we have captured of which i think they said over six thousand people from over there 

429.31 431.61 A: mhm [mn] that sounds right 

430.95 443.61 B: supposedly you know they're going by some kind of guidelines where they're you know the u._s. is not abusing these people at all and they're trying to they they take care of them maybe we're not maybe our people aren't i don't know i think i don't know 

443.21 451.14 A: well i was surprised to find out that those seven p._o._w.s were still alive i didn't have any faith i just didn't think they would be 

447.59 449.37 B: i kn- i was too 

450.82 452.78 B: i was very surprised 

452.18 457.23 A: i'm very pleased that they were but i i didn't i didn't expect that 

454.01 455.10 B: right 

457.29 462.08 A: yeah i think in the case of the six thousand prisoners that we have of theirs 

462.33 465.94 A: they were barely being fed barely being clothed 

466.07 474.32 A: and the situation that they're in as long as they remain prisoners is probably even a better situation that they were in prior to being captured 

473.68 480.12 B: probably but another thing that irritates me is now our u._s. dollars is gonna feed those six thousand people 

479.98 486.41 A: oh that's the that's the tip of the iceberg do you know how much money it's gonna cost us to rebuild that country 

485.05 496.10 B: and that too right my ten year old daughter keeps saying to me you know she listens to the news a little bit and she'll say why are we rebuilding their country we just bombed their butts why are we paying to rebuild it 

494.46 495.38 A: [laughter] 

495.65 497.21 A: that's a tough question 

496.49 503.39 B: [laughter] i don't know how to answer her question um i don't know i told her to ask her teacher let them think about it [laughter] 

498.43 500.17 A: now that's the truth 

501.80 505.96 A: yeah yeah that's that's a good ques- that put it on them they 

506.01 514.57 A: spend a lot more time having to come up with that kind of answer than it's a tough question to be answering to your children no doubt about it how many kids do you have good for you 

508.13 509.93 B: right yeah [laughter] 

512.79 513.69 B: (( three )) 

514.44 515.00 B: (( [sigh] )) 

514.96 516.04 A: good for you 

515.99 517.16 B: you don't have any 

516.79 522.49 A: no i don't um nephews and nieces but but no no children of our own 

517.48 518.37 B: okay 

522.31 523.39 B: mhm 

522.75 529.93 A: um i'm getting a little long in the tooth a little long in years at this point so i suspect that i'll stay that way 

529.89 539.47 A: and if wanna see kids i either go to my nieces and nephews or or i visit some friends and i say yeah that's why i don't want kids now i remember [laughter] 

537.68 541.97 B: [noise] [laughter] oh golly yeah that's the truth oh boy 

539.95 543.68 A: that's not really true but there's some truth to it 

543.16 550.07 B: yeah there is a lot of truth to it the kids they oh god they run through the house and they trash the house and they oh geez 

549.47 550.87 A: that's the truth 

550.25 551.46 B: [laughter] 

551.57 554.94 A: well it's nice talking to you i suspect that um 

551.61 552.38 B: yeah 

554.80 557.07 B: well it should go but if if y- 

556.03 558.78 A: any second now they should probably 

557.17 558.99 B: yeah any second it should be 

558.83 570.07 A: should be kicking in so it looks as if they must put some sort of a timer on it and then it comes on and tells us you have x. number of seconds just to end the phone call or something 

569.46 571.84 B: yeah 'cause a r- a recording will come on 

571.56 581.89 A: i see i see um were you watching c._n._n. during this this time when the when the war was on or were you trying to avoid it as much as you could 

581.13 583.36 B: i was watching it as much as i 

583.60 588.58 B: could you know as much as possible i actually i don't know i actually wanted to 

584.07 585.30 A: i see 

588.68 599.89 B: you know see you know what i mean a lot even now like i have c._n._n. on a lot and my husband's like why do you keep putting that on who cares not like who cares but he's just getting so you know there's just so much information
