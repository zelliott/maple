28.65 32.54 B: yes yeah [laughter] it's a broad [laughter] 

32.64 35.35 B: hot topic i guess right now [laughter] 

34.86 36.78 A: yeah

39.05 42.04 B: attained what's your opinions on that

44.39 45.70 A: it's um 

46.08 47.33 A: given 

47.50 50.04 A: america's current uh 

50.05 53.04 A: attitudes towards um 

54.16 54.73 A: (( [mn] )) 

54.76 61.17 A: uh the state of palestine or the formation of a state of palestine i i don't i don't know if 

61.33 66.64 A: if it'll be any time soon that peace will be attained 

66.30 67.27 B: mhm 

67.03 68.70 A: what do you think 

68.84 70.01 B: well um 

70.07 78.12 B: actually it's kind of interesting 'cause um i my i'm a christian so a lot of the at least it's interesting to see how um 

78.20 84.97 B: a lot of the stuff like biblically it coincides with what is going on right now as far as 

84.93 98.88 B: just different prophecy and things in the christian or just as far as like how over in like the middle east area how it's just um there's going to be a lot of conflict there and how like a lot of like babylon and stuff you know that's in present day iraq 

98.85 102.54 B: [cough] um that like plays a part in everything so 

102.62 104.82 B: i think [noise] because of that until 

105.05 113.28 B: we you know w- we have like the end of the world so christ comes back then i no i don't think that there will ever be peace there i don't think that it's gonna 

113.51 116.53 B: and i think it's only going to get worse i guess i mean i think there'll be a ti 

115.95 116.52 A: (( so )) 

116.81 119.06 A: so you think that there'll be peace 

116.81 117.82 B: oh go ahead 

119.27 122.36 A: only when christ comes back 

122.57 124.05 A: is that 

123.57 124.76 B: yes 

124.15 125.97 A: what you think 

125.41 133.13 B: yes until he yeah until he comes back and then i mean i don't know are y- are you very familiar with the christian beliefs as far as 

132.93 140.95 A: [mn] w- i went to catholic high school so i've had i took i took courses in old testament but that was many many many years ago 

135.48 136.41 B: oh okay 

140.17 141.92 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

141.20 142.27 A: that um 

142.46 144.27 B: well 'cause um with the 

144.47 146.90 B: the prophesy as far as you know like whenever 

146.96 150.83 B: god comes back for uh this is it's kind of 

151.04 157.69 B: complex i guess so but since you're kind of probably familiar with some of it as far as 'cause like in b- with babylon how they um 

157.95 169.81 B: you know how it was a big biblical city and how you know it was destroyed and everything and then how um saddam hussein now kind of has been working to rebuild that i don't know you know if you were 

162.59 163.61 A: mhm 

169.95 171.59 B: aware of that but um 

171.91 173.55 B: and like scripturally of 

172.59 178.77 A: working to rebuild the the uh hanging gardens of babylon and stuff mhm 

174.81 175.85 B: babylon 

176.18 184.48 B: yeah uh-huh yeah and so that was kind of that's kind of biblically in there so i think it's kind of interesting how it kind of all 

181.47 182.68 A: so saddam 

183.94 186.87 A: does does the bible sort of uh 

184.64 185.81 B: (( works together )) 

187.09 188.06 A: (( um )) 

188.69 197.33 A: uh foretell the destruction of babylon by a very christian person like george bush 

197.22 201.95 B: no [laughter] no actually when it comes to play it's not going to be um 

202.22 210.85 B: it won't be in um the u._s. it's funny how whenever it kind of that comes to play the u._s. really isn't in the picture much as far as whenever 

210.91 215.94 B: god returns like it's more a it's a middle eastern country that kind of takes 

214.98 223.70 A: but but do they talk about intervention by a large christian power like the unite- you know like the united states would be 

223.51 234.14 A: considered you know like some sort of a christian king coming to babylon and destroying it once again or or going or 

234.04 235.08 B: no 

234.23 236.10 A: you know somehow settling 

236.14 245.65 B: no uh yeah i know i know it doesn't and actually 'cause i don't believe that this is the end time here whatever that this is god coming back you know but i just think um 

236.34 237.03 A: (( it )) 

245.85 260.10 B: some of the things that prophesied like i think some of these events and i don't know what even these events that are happening now what exactly they have to do you know how exactly it'll play out but i just think it's kind of precursors if you will does that kinda makes sense as far as like 

259.95 271.56 B: to how things in like whenever god does return i think it's kind of precursors to that i think it's kind of like starting to shape up because if you look at like twenty years ago babylon wasn't even 

271.91 277.49 B: considered you know in iraq you never heard about or not baby- excuse me like iraq wasn't even 

277.84 288.70 B: you didn't hear much ab- you know anything about it and now it's sort of funny how suddenly like it's all over the place it's all over the world you know and so i just think like how the conflict in the middle east is just kind of 

289.28 290.28 B: it's funny 

289.46 304.32 A: well the conflict in the middle east seems to be older than saddam hussein and and i mean i- i- it has to do with um israeli occupation and um and uh displacement of people who were already there how do you feel about that 

293.59 294.64 B: (( yeah )) 

298.96 299.79 B: yeah 

302.40 303.52 B: (( yeah and a- )) 

304.27 307.83 B: (( about the israeli occu- occupa- well with um )) 

308.47 311.40 B: you know just i don't know if you're very familiar with like 

311.65 315.83 B: beginning of time how like you know israel being god's chosen people 

315.88 320.40 B: and that sort of thing are you very aware of like the the biblical history there 

318.65 319.41 A: i'm 

320.20 323.79 A: i'm aware of it but more like a comic book it doesn't i mean i'm 

323.21 324.87 B: okay it's not really a 

324.08 331.59 A: i'm a i'm a i'm a scientist and so it it it really doesn't um [sigh] it doesn't mean much to me you know 

330.53 335.84 B: okay well just because you're a scientist doesn't have to i mean it's not but i mean historically 

331.93 332.86 A: (( [laughter] )) 

334.84 337.33 A: no but so so if uh 

337.91 340.00 A: well what do you mean historically so 

340.19 346.72 A: i i mean there were other people on the earth when it [laughter] right 

343.81 356.62 B: yeah oh oh definitely yeah w- whenever i say god's ch- yeah yeah whenever i say god's chosen people i don't mean they're the only ones that are going to go to heaven or anybody no i don't mean that at all um but i don't know if you like if you've ever 

356.72 358.89 B: [cough] read as far as like in 

359.07 363.76 B: you know the beginning of ti- in you know in like genesis and exodus 

363.79 367.86 B: i don't know if you've ev- are very familiar with like those but how it talks about how 

368.06 374.58 B: god chose the people of israel as his chosen chosen people and as far as the conflict there like they were 

374.86 381.32 B: taken out and i i'd really i can't i'm not i know the history but to go through it it would take forever 

375.03 375.95 A: uh-huh 

379.93 389.16 A: so you really feel that like the the current conflict in palestine is is is is somehow related to what 

389.35 392.30 A: what the torah says or or 

392.50 393.66 A: (( uh )) 

393.76 397.96 A: or what the new testament says i i mean is that a 

398.30 401.57 A: really a rational belief on your part 

401.27 402.91 B: well okay i 

403.06 415.59 B: i can't say that like okay what's happening in this verse is like the prophesy is coming true but i mean i think in because in my belief god's in control of everything and he's planning out 

415.94 421.90 B: everything you know in his plan he knows what's going on he knows what's happening so okay it may be another 

422.01 425.36 B: thousands and thousands of years before actually 

425.39 433.62 B: i b- that god does come back but i believe what's happening now it does play into a part it's kind of like just a sequence of events i guess 

433.56 448.42 B: it's kind of like i said earlier a precursor and i i do believe that as far as what's going on now yeah it is it's a rational belief i mean i think and you would even hear a lot of stories a lot of scientists kind of there is evidence that would support that also 

449.11 455.01 A: that would support that what the bible says about a prophecy about israel and palestine 

451.57 452.38 B: (( yeah )) 

453.03 454.57 B: (( yeah and just how )) 

454.62 455.47 B: (( yeah )) 

455.30 456.58 A: is true 

456.13 457.58 B: yeah and i mean i'm not 

458.06 459.36 A: (( hm )) 

458.28 460.80 B: forcing that i'm just saying that you know 

461.23 463.29 B: there's opinions both ways 

463.02 470.19 A: mhm now now does does the bible pr- um does the bible make prophecies about other parts of the world 

463.48 464.84 B: that would support that 

471.22 472.58 B: you know i 

472.87 475.34 B: couldn't tell you for sure because i'm not [laughter] 

474.52 482.97 A: is it a wholly myopic you know text like does it talk about uh europe does it talk about asia 

482.92 487.15 B: it it does talk about yes well you see a lot of the um 

483.18 485.29 A: east asia that has a has a 

487.50 489.47 B: (( a lot of what the bible says )) 

489.62 491.30 B: as far as um 

491.93 493.47 B: different things it's 

494.11 505.66 B: it may not say you know like if it's talking about i- it won't say you know iraq because back you know when the bible was written obviously it wasn't called iraq so you have to infer from like 

505.71 512.85 B: the points that it you know like w- geographically where they're speaking of the area you know so it doesn't mention it doesn't say like 

513.06 517.38 B: you're england or something you know but there are general text as far as like 

517.42 527.78 B: how in in times how there's going to be like a joining of all these different nations and so some people believe that that would be like the joining of many of the european nations 

528.01 531.37 B: so um and i i wish i was more educated as far as 

531.45 536.08 B: how that work you know works i need to do better about getting more knowledge on that but 

536.27 540.96 A: mm but you but but you still somehow hold this to be true without uh 

541.60 543.12 A: full knowledge of 

543.78 546.55 A: of what of what the text says 

543.82 545.80 B: well i guess whatever i say 

546.12 556.26 B: yeah i guess whenever i say the knowledge i have the knowledge but i wish whenever i i it's in the bible and that's where i get my knowledge from is from the bible says so i guess 

556.37 566.49 B: whatever i say of the knowledge i wish that i knew it had it memorized in my head that's 'cause if i you know knew if i could look up the verses if we had hours i could you know give you 

560.64 561.56 A: yeah 

566.71 574.86 B: references from the bible i guess that's what i mean yeah not not just that i have these [laughter] beliefs just because somebody on the street told me [laughter] 

567.80 569.06 A: right right 

569.38 570.31 A: i mean i 

573.08 574.14 A: i don't 

574.24 576.27 A: i don't mean to like um 

576.57 579.78 A: [lipsmack] uh harp on the point but i'm i'm i'm 

580.01 582.16 A: [sigh] how i i mean have 

582.42 594.24 A: the bible is a translation from greek and from aramaic and how do you know that that that that's what that these translations are correct and and and these prophecies are 

595.15 599.95 A: are actually what is said in the text you know these things 

595.71 596.44 B: yeah 

598.05 599.89 B: mhm well
