40.61 49.37 B: um well some of them i guess ah that are not satisfied with the current situation i think maybe some of them there are not just 

49.50 54.74 B: being patient enough because after all the war has just finished you know 

53.87 55.37 A: mhm

82.90 84.45 B: [mn] you know what the the 

84.79 88.99 B: the problem they have over there do you agree with that

104.50 106.56 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

105.79 108.07 A: i mean it may not have happened recently 

108.38 110.86 A: but with giving him time 

110.73 115.85 B: mhm right [mn] but do you think that um with this ah 

116.21 118.42 B: war winding there will be 

118.71 120.70 B: (( any other )) 

121.12 132.56 B: problem arises you know may- we for example right now um [mn] there have been um warnings that we've been giving to syria 

132.85 136.30 B: um and there are talks about 

136.47 139.42 B: pe- perhaps there might be some 

139.44 147.65 B: ah maybe we might be going to war with syria so um why do you what do you think of that 

143.08 143.99 A: mhm 

148.51 153.73 A: i think there's there's going to be continuous bouts of it i mean 

153.61 155.24 B: problem over there 

154.77 157.65 A: mhm i mean i think different countries are going to 

158.67 159.52 A: start 

161.94 164.33 A: start voicing their opinions on 

164.17 165.28 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

165.81 176.57 B: [mn] well i i just think that th- th- the problem with in the middle east just is a continuing problem it's not going to ease out 

173.86 174.54 A: (( mm )) 

177.00 185.29 B: um even after the war in iraq maybe just a little bit there will be some um [lipsmack] 

186.21 196.44 B: positive come out of it in term of um peace in middle east but i don't think it will be much i don't think this will be the answer to the 

196.83 202.97 B: peace in middle east e- especially if between israel and the other middle east countries 

202.44 203.89 A: i don't either i think 

203.44 212.27 B: yeah unfortunately um [mn] you know this is some an issue that has been going on for decades 

211.73 212.93 A: mhm 

212.50 216.09 B: even i don't know maybe even century um 

216.26 217.05 B: (( [lipsmack] i ))

219.33 222.36 B: know history a little bit you know back to 

222.39 231.18 B: the bible age you know how the problems in the middle east between israel israel and the arab countries 

230.77 231.74 A: mhm 

231.56 235.27 B: so that's going to be unfortunately a continuing issue 

235.21 236.89 A: i agree with that 

236.18 238.16 B: yeah and um 

238.52 243.38 B: some people think it's a religion issue but i think it's more than that
