115.57 122.40 B: what you say ah keep the peace over there until it you know until the ah a new government takes over iraq 

117.62 118.70 A: mhm 

123.39 137.81 A: it sounds like we're going to have our hands full with that i mean it's amazing all ready they're already protesting they want ah of all things an islamic government i mean you know a religious founded government and 

137.85 143.06 A: that i don't understand people that i mean they see these other countries 

143.25 148.95 A: boy the the influence of that religion is amazing it's really amazing i think 

143.66 144.39 B: yeah 

148.77 150.02 B: it really is 

149.10 160.02 A: as a woman it scares the hell out of me i have to say that it scares the hell out of me i don't know how i mean and and when i saw our troops in there 

152.33 153.34 B: yeah 

154.75 155.87 B: (( yeah it )) 

159.86 164.64 A: and i saw the people all celebrating well i didn't see too many [laughter] women there it 

164.26 165.64 B: yeah [laughter] 

164.60 177.36 A: was all kids and young guys you know and i thought well i guess the women just don't even go out you know never certainly aren't going to be out demonstrating i guess you know they're n- they just don't do it in those countries 

170.30 171.17 B: yeah 

171.23 172.48 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

177.06 182.55 B: no it's it's dangerous that i guess for 'em to go out over there in them countries and stuff 

177.57 178.84 A: (( kinda scary )) 

182.92 190.73 A: oh yeah and i mean i i mean i just think we had you know [mn] what a little over a hundred deaths [lipsmack] 

183.79 184.65 B: yeah 

190.70 192.14 B: (( yeah ah )) 

191.12 204.08 A: and they're just ah just on our local radio here there was just ah a serviceman being buried today here locally and we have one of the p._o._w.s just a few minutes away in penshawk in new jersey so 

199.71 200.99 B: yeah uh-huh 

203.96 204.93 B: uh-huh 

203.99 211.35 A: we've had a lot of coverage of the p._o._w.s coming back but i i mean i just think with these people 

211.16 220.32 A: willing to blow themselves up at the drop of a hat you know we'll probably lose more people there in peacetime so-called peacetime you know 

214.77 215.71 B: (( uh-huh )) 

218.02 222.02 B: well yeah that's true yeah yeah that's right yeah 

221.36 230.38 A: i i mean and it has been going on for so long i i just don't know how you know i don't know how we're ever going to be able to solve it myself but 

229.81 238.62 B: yeah i i think when we when we went to the last w- when the first first gulf war was ah in in session and ah 

234.83 235.71 A: right 

238.71 245.51 B: george george bush senior was over there i think that's when we we really ought to have took saddam hussein out 

244.62 256.39 A: well i mean a- and that's we probably could have done that i'm sure we you know it was different then we weren't in the country though you know we were in kuwait i mean we were trying to get him back into his country so 

256.15 265.74 A: i can understand that they didn't do it at that time and maybe they thought maybe he'll learn a lesson then you know you'd think the guy would've learned a lesson at that point 

256.30 257.08 B: uh-huh 

264.38 270.34 B: yeah se- well let me ask you a question d- d- do you think do you think they've ah killed him 

265.83 266.58 A: though 

266.79 267.63 A: yes 

270.77 271.86 B: over there 

271.07 279.43 A: do th- i have no idea i kinda think he mi- y- i- it's hard to imagine he could've survived all that but then you th- i thought the same thing about bin laden 

279.46 285.18 A: you know i just think th- and they seemed to have been able to target him a lot better 

279.82 281.34 B: (( uh-huh mm )) 

285.06 298.21 A: don't you think i mean people seem to be blowing the whistle on him and said he's here in our restaurant or he's here at a meeting and they were calling in air strikes so i mean it's hard to belie- but they must have these tunnels that are 

286.08 286.94 B: yeah 

298.53 300.52 A: you know pretty impregnable 

298.57 300.13 B: right yeah 

300.25 302.34 B: oh yeah yeah that's true yeah 

301.53 307.33 A: how about you chris do you think he's he's escaped or he's in ira- i mean in syria or 

307.64 310.24 A: or are we just looking at his doubles [laughter] 

307.66 308.84 B: i think he's 

309.86 314.00 B: [laughter] yeah i think he's i think he's still around over there though 

312.74 313.62 A: yeah 

314.12 319.99 B: and ah he's pro- well like you said he's got a lot of doubles and they said a look alikes 

314.34 314.93 A: (( i )) 

317.60 318.66 A: yeah 

319.36 328.72 A: yes yeah well it's interesting i think i just heard today that they ah someone some iraqis were telling our government that um 

328.66 337.35 A: [lipsmack] just a few days before the war started they were burying or or getting rid of the the so called weapons of mass destruction 

337.25 338.20 B: uh-huh 

337.37 341.41 A: and ah 'cause you know i i mean certainly i think 

341.52 345.95 A: we have got to find something there don't you think i mean we're going to look like 

344.70 348.07 B: oh yeah i agree with you yeah yeah that's true yeah 

346.49 356.92 A: yeah and um and and it seems like a lot of countries felt that they had them there and cer- i me- and i think we knew we had some of them because we gave them some of them 

356.87 361.92 B: right yeah right that's true yeah ourselves yeah that's true yeah 

357.42 359.82 A: [laughter] ourselves 

360.28 365.52 A: yeah yeah so i mean i don't know i just think um 

365.93 369.54 A: [lipsmack] i i don't know whether or not they're going to find them but 

369.78 381.64 A: that that would would help our i think in the world it might help us but it's it's a tough area of the world i do think it is going to be very difficult how long are we still in korea 

381.43 382.82 B: right yeah 

382.08 390.20 A: my god when you think about that you think that's fifty years old and we're still in korea are we ever going to leave that country 

383.52 384.44 B: (( exactly )) 

390.11 392.61 B: yeah that's true yeah you're right 

391.42 394.94 A: and that's still a problem that's going to be a bigger problem 

394.68 397.82 B: yeah that's true there yeah that's going to be a bigger problem 

398.49 404.70 A: but all these other countries they must be like syria i thought they must be quaking in their boots 

404.57 406.39 B: yeah that's true 

406.00 412.09 A: [laughter] i wouldn't want to be in their position all of a sudden they're in this line of fire i think so 

406.59 408.11 B: [laughter] 

411.09 414.82 B: oh no i wouldn't want to be over there in their line of fire uh-uh 

412.80 413.81 A: (( yeah )) 

413.98 417.02 A: now was did you have many um 

417.14 424.34 A: ah i'm sure there's a lot of military br- you have bases and all do you have a base in your area [mn] certainly a lot in the south 

423.42 427.94 B: ah yeah we yeah we we live close to a base ah fort gillum 

427.39 428.36 A: uh-huh 

428.28 431.35 B: yeah fort gillum and ah fort mcpherson 

431.07 432.27 A: oh okay 

432.17 433.87 B: (( ah it's in east point [mn] )) 

435.23 437.31 B: (( ah ha and ah )) 

438.14 448.87 A: and that part of it was you know eh um um i think the troops certainly acquitted themselves well i mean it w- certainly watching that war on television was certainly amazing i think you know 

448.18 450.70 B: (( oh yeah oh yeah that's true yup )) 

449.56 457.97 A: but i i just keep thinking about that part of the world i really don't i don't know they the the people seem to think so differently than we're used to 

458.14 461.05 B: right yeah yeah that's true yeah 

458.27 459.14 A: you know 

459.22 460.26 A: i think th- 

460.43 474.62 A: i think even the germans in world war two at least we probably had more in common in terms of how we looked at the world i guess than i mean i don't although they said the japanese that was a very different kind of 

474.66 475.83 A: a people 

474.88 477.34 B: yeah oh yeah right yeah 

476.20 482.18 A: and and they've become a you know ah a democracy which they hadn't been for 

482.26 487.23 A: [mn] hundreds of ye- thousands of years i guess so i suppose it's possible 

485.19 486.15 B: right 

487.39 493.03 A: i don't know it's very hard it's very hard it's been going on there for so so long 

493.07 496.62 A: you know it's a shame we've been drawn into it like we have 

493.35 494.32 B: oh yeah 

496.45 498.97 B: yeah it is it really is a shame yeah 

498.22 504.74 A: do you think they were do you th- how how do you think nine eleven is connected to iraq 

505.20 507.32 B: (( ah )) 

507.68 509.81 B: yes i think i think it's 

510.02 520.04 B: connected with it a little bit 'cause they said that he had ah the president stated on t._v. that he had weapons of mass destruction so we had to go over there and ah 

511.35 512.36 A: mhm 

518.31 519.13 A: right 

519.73 526.73 A: it's hard to i don't know i'm not a big i have to say i'm not a you probably voted for george the south did um 

521.00 521.99 B: yeah 

526.13 527.71 B: [laughter] 

526.69 537.57 A: i i didn't [laughter] we'll have to respectfully disagree if that's the case but no i just i don't know i don't know i hate to see the 

528.28 530.30 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

537.56 546.21 A: you know us going out on our i thank god for the brits for once i can say that being irish i can't say that very often but i was 

544.26 545.33 B: [laughter]

548.75 551.82 B: yeah tony blair yeah i love tony blair ah 

549.07 550.07 A: and i like 

551.16 558.50 A: yeah and i like colin powell i think he's you know he seems like an honorable person and maybe because he's been in the military 

558.75 570.04 A: he's less reluctant ah you know he thinks twice about sending kids off to you know die in some other country i guess but i i don't know i i- 

558.90 559.77 B: uh-huh 

570.06 581.86 A: i- i i i just don't know who's calling the shorts for george bush i hope i wish him him well i wish him well but he's bitten off an awful i think we've made a lot of enemies over there 

577.05 578.78 B: yeah 

581.95 585.57 A: it's scary and maybe that's just the way it's gonna to have to be 

582.06 582.93 B: yeah 

585.95 589.43 B: yeah that's true yeah yeah you're right yeah 

586.87 588.98 A: mhm do you find 

589.00 599.89 A: do you find that i i my guess is i don't know where in the south you're from i'm just you know i always see that as a very patriotic part of the country were there protests going on down there
