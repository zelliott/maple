0.13 1.38 B: (( hello )) 

0.98 2.14 A: hello 

1.94 3.21 B: hi [lipsmack] 

2.71 4.11 A: hi i'm lance 

3.89 5.96 B: i'm nana how are you lance 

5.52 6.58 A: okay 

6.20 12.37 B: good [lipsmack] um i guess let's get this conversation started [laughter] this is so weird 

9.46 13.04 A: [laughter] okay that enough 

12.66 25.06 B: yeah um i guess as far as what's going on in the middle east from day one i've been extremely opposed to it um [lipsmack] it's actually kind of confusing to me as to exactly what bush was intending 

24.96 28.97 B: you know to do in the middle east if it's as far as overthrowing saddam 

28.96 40.36 B: i personally just felt as though that's something that the people of iraq should have you know taken into their own hands if they felt as though he needed to be overthrown that's something they should have dealt with i don't think we should have moved in 

40.54 43.59 B: you know into the country to overthrow their leader 

43.87 48.61 A: okay okay uh i didn't take the question that way at all 

43.97 44.81 B: um 

48.68 56.38 A: uh iraq and iran are not considered the middle east by my reckoning of geopolitics uh the 

56.30 63.81 A: by the middle east they're referring to uh uh the palestinian uh israeli conflict 

63.47 65.14 B: oh okay i'm sorry i'm 

63.80 65.78 A: in in in my understanding 

65.33 69.05 B: (( okay from my understanding i thought we were yeah )) 

65.76 80.06 A: [laughter] now of course they don't give us any guidance so i can't say one way or the other uh my inclination w- w- when people refer to the unrest in the middle east that's not referring i don't think to uh iraq and uh the uh 

69.83 71.09 B: yeah i guess um 

80.84 92.75 A: ongoing conflict there [laughter] uh my inclination is uh that it's that that it's the other thing th- th- that w- when they refer to growing unrest that's what i or continuing unrest rather 

82.54 84.04 B: mhm 

92.80 95.13 A: uh that's the way that i took that one 

95.13 96.81 B: oh okay well 

95.80 101.97 A: so um the a- i don't care which side you want w- w- which segment you want to 

101.94 110.88 A: continue on if you want to continue i- in your interpretation or uh work with mine that's that's the i can go either way [laughter] 

108.96 116.89 B: oh okay um i guess i'm more well versed in what's go- i see well iraq and iraq is um part of the middle east 

116.34 118.45 A: (( um well )) 

119.20 120.33 A: [sigh] n- 

120.43 122.07 A: not exactly 

122.06 125.62 B: okay well maybe you know [laughter] more about this than i do i just 

122.25 125.06 A: [laughter] yeah it it's it's it's 

125.29 129.84 A: it's it's actually considered central asia um 

129.92 131.27 A: (( a- or persia )) 

131.32 132.46 B: (( [cough] )) 

131.46 134.78 A: uh which uh predates 

135.18 137.60 A: a lot of the other stuff [laughter] 

137.02 137.93 B: okay 

137.85 145.05 A: by quite a bit so um and anyway if you if you want to talk on that one and stuff uh you know i 

146.22 150.98 A: i have tended to be a pacifist for thirty plus years [laughter] 

149.96 151.69 B: (( mhm mm [laughter] )) 

151.01 153.42 A: uh not so much uh 

153.53 154.79 A: um 

155.18 164.31 A: based not not so much basing it on any kind of philosophical issues but just uh practicality uh and uh granted 

164.52 168.56 A: part of that may be the fact that i grew up during the vietnam era [laughter] 

167.99 169.25 B: okay [laughter] 

168.55 179.15 A: uh and i thought it was a horrendous waste but at that point it was recognized as a waste as opposed to uh ten years before that when it was 

171.05 172.07 B: yeah 

179.13 188.01 A: recognized as uh a them or us and that was the only way to survive was to w- was to eliminate the uh the the communist menace so to speak 

182.76 183.76 B: yeah 

188.06 192.27 A: um you know in this particular case 

192.69 203.62 A: my own personal gut feel for it was why did they waste all that time and resources and materials all it would have taken was a single uh presidential finding 

203.66 205.88 A: uh by 

205.96 206.95 A: w. 

207.06 208.65 A: to uh 

208.98 222.41 A: say okay fine we're going to ignore what previous administrations have considered illegal and just send in uh s- send in some assassination squads and take care of it nip it at the top uh 

213.56 214.73 B: mhm 

215.05 215.91 B: yeah 

218.67 219.97 B: exactly 

222.42 227.54 A: but you know my my own gut feel on this is that uh 

227.24 227.80 B: (( [noise] )) 

227.83 229.51 A: we have a little boy 

229.56 239.37 A: there who loves to play with his big toys [laughter] uh and had a personal uh vendetta 

232.32 236.32 B: yeah that's [laughter] that's exactly what it boils down to 

238.63 240.26 B: vendetta exactly 

239.80 246.32 A: uh so you know and and that really wasn't appropriate for foreign policy but then again 

246.16 256.24 A: from the outset we didn't expect anything [sigh] uh of any great intelligence from the foreign policy that was going to be put into place by that administration so 

256.28 260.19 A: uh not that previous administrations for the past several 

260.48 261.49 A: uh 

262.04 271.68 A: oh decades had really had an intelligent foreign policy everything for years and years and years has been we the greatest 

271.40 272.73 B: yeah 

271.72 285.78 A: uh and we will impose our will and at the same time claim opposition to anybody else who's doing something so bad as to impose their own will um so [laughter] 

285.87 294.03 A: it's like i'm just glad that right now i'm too old and my kids are too young [laughter] to be to be physically drawn into that 

290.98 292.54 B: yeah it's 

293.45 303.59 B: yeah [noise] i guess um for me it's more it's almost even a a personal issue because i was affected personally through both uh [noise] the first persian gulf war and now 

303.49 314.43 B: the unrest that's happening now because i use- i grew up in kuwait actually so um as a result of the first war of father bush i wound up coming to america 

307.67 308.70 A: mhm 

313.99 314.78 A: (( mm )) 

314.28 319.07 B: and my dad currently still resides in kuwait even as we speak 

318.73 321.80 A: your english is very good [laughter] there's 

319.15 320.09 B: so 

320.20 324.18 B: [laughter] thank you well my my parents are nigerian actually 

323.69 324.59 A: uh-huh 

324.65 327.69 B: um so ibo was my first language and then 

324.93 332.82 A: oh well [laughter] [laughter] well your your your your your your english accent is uh remarkably american 

327.84 329.52 B: english my second 

332.24 335.48 B: (( [laughter] it i- it is it's )) 

332.66 343.52 A: [laughter] [laughter] you've done quite well in that regard and you're probably throwing the linguistics study off off the [laughter] [laughter] that's not our problem though [laughter] 

335.61 337.32 B: [laughter] 

338.56 341.08 B: (( i know [laughter] i'm sure i am )) 

342.78 353.25 B: yeah so um it's even more so a personal thing to me i didn't understand it the first time i still don't understand it this time as to you know why this is going on 

346.73 347.52 A: (( mhm mhm [noise] )) 

353.38 354.26 B: it's 

354.46 363.40 B: it's just crazy i mean millions not millions but so many people are so many civilians are getting hurt over there so i mean when you turn on the news you constantly see 

363.53 369.70 B: you know innocent children mothers men families being torn apart being hurt being wounded 

369.90 377.17 B: over as you said bush being a child being a boy playing with these toys you know trying to avenge 

373.67 374.41 A: yeah 

375.46 376.37 A: (( well it's a )) 

376.85 377.78 A: right 

377.21 379.63 B: whatever between his father and saddam 

379.38 383.83 A: right so um you know a lot a lot of this uh 

384.38 389.19 A: (( you know this game h- h- having having had )) 

389.57 403.35 A: u._s. military in the family for all generations prior to mine uh i i do think i understand a little bit about the the military outlook on the things as well and uh [sigh] 

392.24 393.38 B: mhm 

403.98 405.54 A: to some extent 

407.75 414.01 A: a lot of the stuff that we see media wise is so orchestrated 

413.41 415.13 B: yeah that's true 

414.41 423.37 A: um and you know a- a- and all parties are orchestrating uh you know and both sides are providing propaganda in the extreme 

423.47 438.38 A: um i do have my doubts as to the extreme level of civilian casualties uh primarily because an awful lot of regular forces on the uh on the opposing side uh 

438.80 444.26 A: quickly doffed their uniforms uh you know they're not following the 

444.71 448.58 A: [lipsmack] oh the accepted procedures 

448.07 448.79 B: mm 

448.69 459.13 A: uh such that an awful lot of the civilian personnel that are crying in the hospitals are not necessarily civilian personnel certainly the adult males the vast majority are not civilians 

458.82 459.80 B: mm 

459.34 461.16 A: uh the 

462.03 475.09 A: the others that's in a lot of respects that's because of the one th- the methods that are used by the opposition uh you know the uh if you look back at some of the uh 

475.06 486.01 A: some of the coverage that was provided of of the prior uh conflict with uh um european citizens who did not get out soon enough 

485.41 486.69 B: mhm 

486.02 496.22 A: being play being used as human shields uh of course there's none of those any more so what else has he got to use but his own people as as shields and you know 

493.61 494.63 B: yeah 

496.26 497.73 A: (( uh you know )) 

497.75 510.29 A: vast efforts were obvious to me that there's a lot of things they could have done that would have been a whole lot worse but they pulled the punches so to speak 

510.58 511.71 A: um 

512.95 514.17 A: but uh 

515.47 518.44 A: i still think that the best way to do it would have been to use 

518.46 529.14 A: as high tech as possible and uh um you know a couple of a couple more of the of the delta force type of folks would have taken care of a lot [laughter] 

527.99 529.80 B: yeah [laughter] 

529.32 539.86 A: so now i'm simply waiting to see whether or not all the uh all the uh things that they swear they were going after uh if those are going to ever materialize 

536.30 538.12 B: yeah exactly 

539.20 540.42 B: yeah 

540.11 545.80 A: um you know in a lot of cases a a lot of this has to do with 

545.83 551.53 A: uh the the american culture seems to think that it can push a button and solve a problem 

550.94 551.89 B: yeah 

551.61 554.65 A: and uh we know that that is not 

554.85 556.95 B: that's not the case that's not 

554.94 559.57 A: the way it's not y- y- you cannot solve that uh if i- 

559.60 568.48 A: if someone b- basically i'm going to wish hard enough and solve it and uh if wishes could solve things 

564.35 565.50 B: yeah 

568.55 575.52 A: if wishes could solve things and stuff there'd be a whole lot of other things that were solved a whole lot of other problems that are solved so 

572.22 573.30 B: mhm 

574.36 576.18 B: yeah 

576.13 576.97 A: anyhow 

577.16 578.10 A: (( so [sigh] )) 

579.66 580.64 B: (( [sigh] let's see )) 

579.93 583.88 A: i'll le- i'll i'll let you proceed for a while [laughter] 

581.70 594.96 B: [laughter] um [lipsmack] let's see as you said um as you started to mention you're curious just to see what's going to become of all of this um i feel the exact same way now you turn on the news and 

594.92 599.89 B: it's constant talk about saddam is dead is he alive is he you know what so what hap-
