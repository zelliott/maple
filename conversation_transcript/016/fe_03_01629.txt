40.78 42.22 B: (( do you oh okay )) 

41.77 43.25 A: yeah um 

42.75 45.27 B: i know there's some very much against it 

44.89 59.46 A: well i just feel as though i mean we have to i mean right now i think that um that the u._s. and israel share a common enemy and i mean it just makes sense that you know we should be allying ourselves with them you know i agree an- and i think too part i think not only do we have to do it to protect ourselves um but i think someone 

59.74 61.14 A: (( needed to help help the people )) 

61.35 63.05 B: (( right )) 

63.09 64.32 B: (( i )) 

64.35 65.70 B: (( agree so )) 

66.94 67.79 B: (( i )) 

69.18 72.31 A: i agree i mean an- and if we're supposed to be a big country that's like like 

72.66 84.88 A: you know the protector of all the other democracies and supposed to be supporting those countries which are you know um which are part of you know the democratic world then you know it just makes sense that we would be supporting them 

84.44 92.82 B: agree i agree and i get angry that you know the people that say we you know because we are big and we're powerful and we take [noise] too much um 

93.04 96.62 B: too much charge but you know what nobody else does i mean [noise] 

95.57 97.78 A: exactly like if it's not us then who 

97.57 102.19 B: right right so you know they would have just left a gallon and of course we were the ones that had the big 

102.53 104.95 B: nine one one so um 

103.83 107.25 A: of course it just shows that it could happen to us you know 

107.55 108.50 A: so 

109.18 110.90 B: exactly um 

111.26 113.19 B: and i think ah 

113.42 116.33 B: i think th- i think we'll eventually 

116.37 123.30 B: i honestly don't i think they said do you think there will ever be peace ah there's always going to be something you know if it's not ah 

123.46 131.47 B: iraq it will be afghanistan or you know korea or somebody um but i think this is a big step 

131.59 132.50 B: um 

133.01 134.43 B: [noise] toward 

135.99 149.42 B: i think iraq was huge as far as a problem for us and for everyone really um and and there's always going to be somebody there's always going to be something that that you know is causing problems but i think this is huge and the fact that we're 

140.35 141.38 A: mhm 

149.93 152.55 B: you know gonna keep going until 

153.89 154.86 B: you know 

155.03 162.38 B: until the the regime is knocked out or until we find osama or or something um is a big thing although i think that will take a while 

163.38 164.79 A: right yeah 

163.81 165.18 B: if we ever find them 

164.97 169.66 A: right it's just this is a complicated been going on you know since pretty much the beginning 

169.04 169.90 B: right right 

169.79 174.89 A: yeah right so i just i just don't see how it could be resolved any time soon but 

170.65 171.93 B: exactly 

174.08 174.85 B: (( no )) 

175.63 177.72 B: no no and even um 

178.37 184.26 B: you know organizing iraq right now you know i think that will take a long time i mean there's a country that has been [noise] 

184.33 187.68 B: first under this strong arm and now 

187.73 193.11 B: now they're tasting freedom and of course with freedom comes like that deluding and stuff i think 

193.44 199.14 B: they're gonna wanna kinda stretch their wings a little bit and and i think it will take a little bit to get 

199.36 205.40 B: a democracy or whatever kind of government over there um i can't imagine what that must be like 

202.39 203.26 A: mhm 

205.49 208.14 B: ah like i said having been under his 

208.24 216.72 B: um charge for so many years and now they can kinda do what they want i think that's gonna be tough i think honestly 

210.86 211.78 A: mhm 

216.57 225.13 B: you know the fighting was hard because of the killing and all that but i think this is going to be a ah a tough job for you know whoever decides to help out or 

225.14 229.81 B: you know put their what do you think as far as do you think we should ah you know this whole 

230.63 233.34 B: united states versus the u._n. you know 

234.46 236.42 B: organizing the government 

236.93 242.48 A: um i i kinda think that it's the only way but i'm not sure if it's gonna be effective you know 

241.72 242.61 B: right 

243.41 245.85 B: right i mean it's hard and and and getting 

246.20 253.20 B: part of me thinks okay you know france for example oh the united states isn't going to have the seine i'm thinking you know what we're the one who freed 

253.64 260.36 B: them i think everybody needs to jump in and add their two cents but i think we need to lead it i think we should be kind of the 

253.77 254.49 A: mhm 

260.41 263.11 B: the in charge ones and let everybody else 

263.99 273.53 B: you know give their opinions and and input and stuff but um like that like you know like the ones that have really opposed us and really put us down 

273.74 274.68 B: um 

274.89 278.19 B: i don't know i don't think they should have a lead role in it that's for sure 

277.69 278.57 A: mhm 

278.86 281.07 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

281.73 283.91 B: not that i know a whole lot about government people 

283.31 284.57 A: [laughter] 

284.36 287.69 B: i don't i think i've learned more this past three weeks than 

288.10 290.00 B: that i've known my whole life 

289.53 293.43 A: right i just i try to avoid it you know because i find it pretty depressing mhm 

293.06 298.06 B: it's get- yeah you know what at first i was glued i was absolutely glued to the t._v. 

298.25 299.81 B: um and now i 

299.97 308.48 B: don't i don't even watch it every you know besides little bits and pieces i hear on the station or something i don't even really know what's going on although it would be interesting to see how they 

308.74 311.26 B: organize you know a country 

312.21 314.35 B: that has been so 

314.67 320.63 B: you know maintained by one man um it it seems like an overwhelming job to me 

320.29 321.65 A: yeah definitely 

320.75 324.70 B: um but i think we can do it i mean we've done it i think before 

325.11 326.16 B: somewhat 

326.50 332.23 B: um like i said i just i worry about you know syria now and and whoever else um 

332.47 335.31 B: that it will continue and i hope you know i hope that they 

335.63 339.20 B: see how quickly we we took over iraq and and cleared that 

339.34 341.92 B: that they won't do anything stupid or anything 

341.44 344.43 A: [laughter] right well there's there's no telling right 

344.17 345.58 B: right exactly 

346.03 350.01 B: and the whole thing with him you know possibly being alive who 

350.60 355.56 B: who knows what's up with that but it would be easier if we knew for sure obviously but 

351.93 353.30 A: yeah 

356.51 358.68 B: yeah i mean i do think i think there will be 

359.15 364.63 B: a much more sense of peace i don't think i don't think in our lifetime there's ever going to be a total 

364.84 368.60 B: worldly peace you know i think it can it can be much better but 

365.89 366.76 A: mhm 

369.42 372.09 B: unfortunately i think there's gonna be always those 

372.48 377.25 B: saddam type followers and and osama foll- followers and stuff that 

377.66 380.46 B: are going to cause more problems than you know 

381.84 382.49 B: (( but )) 

382.49 384.64 A: (( so it's fanatics right mhm [laughter] )) 

384.01 389.11 B: right right exactly and i'm sure there's some left in this country too i'm sure you know 

389.64 394.84 B: whether or not they're just laying low or what but i can't believe we have ridded them all from here too
