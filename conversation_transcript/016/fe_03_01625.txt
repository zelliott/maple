0.64 1.82 A: hi 

0.70 2.84 B: hello hey 

1.83 3.33 A: hi [laughter] 

3.37 4.74 A: i'm theresa 

4.75 6.81 B: i l- my name's james 

6.81 9.01 A: it's nice to oh pretty good 

6.92 8.27 B: how are you doing 

9.37 13.69 B: oh well the topic is the middle east what do you think about it 

11.82 21.54 A: ye- [laughter] um well actually i guess i'm pretty glad that everything so far has worked out the way that it has i don't know about you 

22.26 30.19 B: yeah well i still like they haven't really found any weapons of mass destruction i mean i kinda 

28.82 30.07 A: (( well i just hear- )) 

30.13 31.33 A: oh go ahead 

31.01 45.27 B: uh i kind of i'm kind of suspicious of the government because sometimes i feel like the media and all that's controlled by rich and powerful people and i wonder sometimes if it wasn't more about the oil than anything else 

45.83 50.48 A: well i'm sort of on the opposite end of you i guess 'cause um 

51.04 52.78 A: i kind of think 

52.89 54.23 A: that um 

54.40 57.97 A: if it was for oil it was mostly for 

58.35 67.57 A: france and germany's benefit and russia because it seems like they were the ones [noise] that had most invested in their time with that 

60.44 62.41 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

67.29 70.22 B: he's still on the chair i'm sorry go ahead 

69.64 70.73 A: that's okay [laughter] 

71.15 73.73 A: and uh we basically just um 

74.23 82.62 A: went in there because i think we thought that if we didn't eventually they were gonna try to pull another nine eleven on us 

81.01 94.71 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] right yeah i i i i agree with that because i [noise] i thought about i thought about that also and i also thought about [noise] too that korea uh maybe got a message by [noise] us going over there taking care of this 

92.07 92.97 A: yeah 

94.25 104.67 A: i do too i totally agree with you with that 'cause i i think that and syria did too it looks like 'cause now they're saying that they're turning over some people that they needed to turn over 

95.08 97.94 B: yeah yeah i 

100.16 101.57 B: yeah i 

104.64 113.18 B: right yeah 'cause i i did think that was a good result that it showed that the united states was willing to go to war 

113.12 122.44 B: you know and willing to stand up because i i really did think that nine eleven we went too long before we actually took any kind of real action 

121.85 131.01 A: yeah and i think we're still not resolved in afghanistan really we could figure out what's going on with osama bin laden a little better i think but [laughter] 

122.79 124.53 B: yeah 

131.68 136.42 A: as far as peace in the middle east do you ever think there's gonna be peace over there or 

138.47 140.17 A: what's your thoughts on that 

139.95 144.90 B: [noise] uh i don't really think there's gonna ever be peace over there because [noise] it it's uh 

144.97 154.25 B: religious turmoil they'd have to be it would if it did come it would have to be over the next fifteen years it would not be quickly um it would it hav- 

152.71 154.31 A: oh i agree with you 

154.50 164.26 B: yeah it's gonna have to take some time for people to um become more informed i think that you know maybe i don't know 

164.67 175.06 B: our presence over there you know 'cause see we we look at ourselves as having good intentions but other people in other countries see us as an uh as intruders 

174.49 183.13 A: [laughter] i agree with that i think they do um especially i i've had another conversation with someone about this and we were talking about it and 

183.04 192.15 A: just how much i don't think we even realise how much they hate us over there until stuff like this happens until nine eleven happened really and then 

192.15 198.50 A: um now i've heard that some of these people were like in mosques and stuff and they heard 

198.47 212.81 A: one of their clerics talking about hating america and the guy got up and walked out the young people were like we don't believe this any more and i think it's gonna have to come to that kind of an understanding before they ever resolve their issues with us 

212.42 217.36 B: right and a lot of things too is like uh france i mean i don't know 

217.41 218.77 B: you know i heard 

218.90 225.22 B: from a lot of people that they're [noise] jealous of the united states there's a lot of jealousy issues with them [noise] 

223.26 230.40 A: i wouldn't doubt that and and it's weird because we never even knew that they were jealous of us at least i had no clue you know 

226.18 227.28 B: (( [noise] )) 

230.57 231.75 B: right 

231.16 236.16 A: and and then you think about that and and i think a lot of times too um 

236.24 243.80 A: the middle eastern people are afraid that we're gonna come over and just you know like what they thought we were gonna do in iraq i think that kinda helped 

241.95 243.00 B: right 

243.96 252.06 A: them see no we just wanted to help these people get free form this idiot dictator and to because we knew he was you know like 

250.07 250.77 B: yes 

251.18 260.02 B: right that wa- yeah what we do um as far as you know how we handle this will reflect our true intentions yeah 

258.54 259.70 A: that's true 

259.82 267.70 A: but i think we've done pretty good so far with with kinda holding back and letting them kinda start to take over stuff that belongs to them 

267.76 273.96 A: their police are now you know in charge of a lot of the stuff that's going on we're just kinda overseeing it all 

273.97 275.08 B: right 

274.49 279.78 A: so let's hope for the rest of the middle east that at least starts to look towards our favor 

279.91 286.73 B: right i think that that will do more to reflect the true nature of our intentions as a nation 

286.27 287.39 A: that's true 

288.22 289.68 B: yeah 

289.04 292.52 A: yeah i think that we've um done pretty good 

292.62 305.33 A: with um you know we didn't even realise this guy's like hitler i don't think we realised the yeah we didn't know the extent to which he was doing this with all i i heard he like imprisoned children and 

297.18 299.24 B: yeah i didn't realise that either 

305.35 312.65 A: stuff like that and it's like you know when you really stop and think about it we didn't really wanna get involved in world war two at first either 

312.59 321.32 A: and then when it became our business because you know pearl harbor and all that and then we absolutely had to do something about it 'cause it was our 

321.49 333.47 A: our duty to protect ourselves and a- they a lot of people talk about the pre emptive strike and all that and oh we shouldn't do that i think we almost have to now because it's we're at a point where we can't 

333.83 334.84 A: not 

334.46 337.17 B: wait until the disaster occurs 

335.26 340.39 A: yeah we yeah because then it's gonna happen to us and do we really wanna do that 

340.35 351.66 B: right 'cause we've already been struck any- really you know we've already been struck in a way if you think about it i mean all that came or originated from the middle east 

351.06 362.58 A: yeah that's true because their hatred for us was dwelling somewhere in this remote little place and they came over here and then they just destroyed what we had and tried to at least 

362.60 374.25 A: and then i believe that a lot of those countries over there are harboring terrorists that they're not talking about even i think even saudi arabia is big time into the mess 

372.20 372.85 B: w- 

373.66 384.95 B: one thing is that really shocked me was that we trained bin laden i i thought that was strange that we we trained trained him to fight in afghanistan is what i heard 

384.52 388.90 A: yeah probably against the russians when they had that whole thing going on with them 

387.54 388.63 B: right 

389.08 396.86 B: and then he turned on us he used our knowledge and every- see that's what made uh nine one one so bad was that they used our own 

396.76 409.38 B: working knowledge and and a- against us we actually it was like t- taking your own fist and someone taking your fist and hitting you in your own face with your own fist that's what i felt like 

398.21 399.08 A: yeah 

408.38 410.78 A: yeah i can understand that 

410.74 412.28 B: (( and and )) 

410.78 418.37 A: i know it almost feels like a double edged sword because in one point you're training people to help themselves as a country 

418.30 426.29 A: and i don't doubt that there's still gonna be iraqi people who hate us i mean and that could come back to haunt us too i'm not saying that it won't but 

426.34 433.43 A: you know sometimes for the good of what's going on at the moment i think sometimes you have to absolutely do what is necessary 

433.89 438.28 A: and i think that's we've even helped saddam before if i remember correctly 

438.20 440.36 B: right yep 

438.76 439.79 A: and 

439.95 449.66 A: just different things and when it served our purpose we did what we had to do you know i think that's true with any country though and i don't ever see that changing with anybody 

449.43 457.72 B: no that's it's you know you know people are gonna serve their interests but we are a f- pretty much a fair country and we 

456.36 457.99 A: yeah i think so too 

457.69 467.88 B: matter of fact i think our nai- we're kinda nai- we're naive in that we thought that we were creating goodwill but a lot of the times people really just don't 

461.90 462.78 A: yeah 

467.72 480.19 B: they don't know that we've done good 'cause they lie to the people like you said earlier they send out negative messages and the people are being influenced by their media which is not an honest honest m- media 

471.21 472.41 A: yeah 

479.56 488.51 A: we know that's true 'cause the day they pulled that statue down they were saying we saw saddam hussein you know [laughter] and i'm like give me a break people you know [laughter] 

488.89 498.93 A: i think they never tell their people the truth i don't ever see it happening i think if there's some way we can bootleg it in there maybe it'll be a different place 

498.30 506.50 B: right like uh radio free europe and you know sort of kinda stuff like where they can get true true facts 

501.82 502.72 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

506.18 508.61 A: yeah i agree with you there
