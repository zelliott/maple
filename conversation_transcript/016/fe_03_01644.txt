400.23 401.49 A: [laughter] 

402.52 412.32 A: that was the one what three years ago that was really i mean did you guys start getting inklings of the of the way things were going long before it was you know front front page news 

412.75 416.91 A: or was it something that really shocked you even at some place like 

416.28 424.50 B: i started there in in may of two thousand so it was really in hindsight it was after the bubble had burst 

419.03 420.20 A: mhm 

423.91 424.76 A: (( right mhm )) 

424.92 426.50 B: and so [mn] 

426.82 431.81 B: and i was there until march of two thousand and two when you know it just looked bleak 

432.38 435.74 B: so my entire experience there was sort of watching things 

435.57 436.42 A: wow 

436.33 438.10 B: (( slowly you know )) 

439.02 440.44 B: slowly decline 

440.92 442.78 A: mhm and ah 

443.02 444.80 A: what did you do before you went there 

445.77 452.76 B: [lipsmack] um before there i was doing web development stuff for um a company called the renegade marketing 

452.99 456.39 B: produced seekrems coolers dot com 

455.82 456.69 A: oh cool 

456.52 457.92 B: amongst other 

458.18 460.16 B: very exciting web sites 

460.88 461.84 B: (( and )) 

463.22 469.24 B: ah um you know i was at t._e._f._a. media so i was doing the agency thing which was just fine but um 

469.93 471.85 B: i talked to one client who 

472.94 476.17 B: had endless discussions about shades of pink 

476.00 477.07 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] i )) 

476.50 478.48 B: (( [laughter] she decided i needed some )) 

477.53 481.11 A: guess that's important though when you're talking about wine coolers it's a real a 

480.51 482.06 B: it's very important 

481.38 484.19 A: real science your ah pastels 

484.11 488.85 B: berry this versus berry that and god forbid you get the wrong berry because 

486.11 486.74 A: (( mhm )) 

489.20 500.12 B: this client was so fussy that you know when she was sixteen she got a nose job and she wasn't happy with it and so she made she went back to the doctor to get them to redo her nose job [laughter] 

499.40 502.10 A: (( mhm it's like ah )) 

501.82 504.16 B: you can imagine she was fun to work for 

503.89 505.65 A: right 

505.34 507.15 B: so um 

507.56 513.48 B: i got out of that but you know it it can be fun and interesting depending on the projects you get to work on 

514.17 514.75 A: (( mhm )) 

514.77 515.70 B: (( ah )) 

515.06 518.09 A: yeah i i wouldn't you know i would love to work for 

518.75 524.82 A: i've been looking looking at some of these smaller design groups um a few in philadelphia of course there's a bunch in new york 

525.24 531.91 A: it's just very very difficult i mean they want you to intern for no salary for a year before they you know would probably even consider 

532.81 540.83 A: a salaried position um and pretty much a lot there there is one firm i interned at really briefly in philadelphia called one six zero ninety 

541.43 544.46 A: and when i was there they had ten full time employees 

544.68 546.46 A: (( and twenty interns )) 

546.38 548.78 B: oh man that's that's just abusive 

548.41 556.09 A: it's criminal yeah and they weren't even i mean and then they would hire somebody and didn't even hire one of their interns they hired a full time interactive guy 

549.47 550.58 B: it's criminal 

558.06 562.99 A: i thought that was really low and i was doing interactive work there it was actually on my fourth day 

563.28 566.53 A: ah interning there i was going in like one or two days a week and i 

566.72 573.18 A: saw this new guy it was like oh yeah he was their new hire for interactive and there were like two other interactive guys there who were 

573.27 574.31 B: interning 

573.90 576.79 A: really talented decent interactive guys and they didn't hire 

577.40 582.85 A: them they took a a a guy and he wasn't even that much older he was like twenty five compared to twenty three 

583.00 583.94 A: twenty two 

584.54 585.42 A: so 

585.53 586.09 B: (( [mn] )) 

586.49 589.19 A: yes i got out of there with that warning sign 

588.95 592.35 B: yeah yeah don't don't let yourself get abused 

591.57 592.34 A: [laughter] 

593.45 596.69 A: but i guess that's the only way they are able to produce work 

597.05 597.87 A: ah 

598.43 599.89 A: for to keep their salaries
