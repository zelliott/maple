25.71 27.73 B: why [laughter] 

26.63 35.93 A: because i [mn] i i think that it goes back in to like back in the day where people just tried to destroy and conquer 

36.15 38.40 A: [mn] and i think that's pretty much i 

36.55 39.95 B: yeah but we have to work you have to work for freedom also 

40.60 47.71 A: think i mean that's that's true in a sense but [mn] it's still a lot lives are going to be lost 

45.86 51.96 B: if our if our grandfathers and great grandfathers didn't fight for us we wouldn't have freedom right now 

53.92 56.81 A: but you got to look at what type of freedom you're talking about 

54.55 55.96 B: (( well it ta- it takes )) 

56.26 59.61 B: it takes a loss of life to get what you need sometimes 

60.46 64.65 B: and we can't take the chance of having terrorists in our country 

64.64 75.99 A: [mn] but i i don't think that you go out and just bomb a country becau- out of fear and i think that's what we did like we had like nothing was substantiated 

74.07 76.23 B: yeah but they have they have ah 

76.75 79.26 B: weapons of mass destruction 

79.09 89.89 A: they haven't been able to prove they have weapons of mass destruction they're still searching areas for the um weapons last i checked they they found pesticide and thought it was chemical weapons 

89.49 92.10 B: no they found some um two days ago 

92.85 94.63 A: where was this at 

94.90 96.78 B: ah somewhere in iraq 

97.23 101.26 A: see i haven't heard anything about that and i watch the news basically every day 

99.16 100.01 B: yeah 

101.04 102.14 B: (( yeah so do i )) 

104.17 107.20 B: we have to fight for freedom for other people too 

107.83 110.09 B: you're not going to get it unless to fight for it 

112.05 117.48 A: i think that a lot of i think that's v- very hypocritical for our nation to do 

117.53 127.44 A: simply because there's so money countries that we are allies with that do a lot of the same things that iraq does as far as torturing their own 

127.53 139.46 A: their own people i mean like south korea they they torture their own people you've got china they torture their own people but for some reason we're singl- singling out iraq and i think 

137.55 140.50 B: yeah but iraq is worse than any other country 

141.93 145.65 A: you can't really sa- you really don't know how bad iraq is 

145.03 145.93 B: well 

147.20 148.17 A: (( you what )) 

148.20 149.29 B: yeah i'm here 

150.06 152.17 A: i i can't hear what you said 

151.72 152.57 B: (( [noise] i )) 

152.81 157.14 B: [noise] uh i said iraq is worse than any country around here 

158.09 170.99 A: i mean i don't i don't really see how like we can say anyone is wor- like if someone kills someone and tortures them i don't see how you can put more into that 

169.52 172.84 B: yeah but they do it for they do it for no means at all though 

174.45 176.41 B: their country is known for 

177.01 183.95 A: i mean i think like their their justice system is different than ours like 

182.81 186.65 B: that they don't have any you have a bunch of guys 

186.77 192.06 B: that are doing what they want and having all the money in the country while their other people are starving 

194.37 197.85 A: but i mean we have people over here that are starving as well [noise] 

196.85 200.68 B: yeah but we're not torturing our people for looking at us in different wa- 

198.39 199.34 A: i 

200.70 204.32 B: wrong ways [noise] as they have over there 

207.29 209.20 A: don't know i mean i just 

210.16 211.56 B: [noise] 

210.48 211.88 A: i don't think this 

212.28 213.68 A: this is right 

217.01 218.77 A: 'cause i don't think that i mean 

217.95 219.96 B: do you like your religious freedom 

220.12 221.26 A: am i what 

221.02 224.18 B: do you like your religious freedom that you have here 

225.30 228.97 A: i mean yeah but i think they 

226.82 230.66 B: well they don't have they don't have that choice there 

230.46 237.48 A: have but i think we've taken it too far i mean when you hear george bush say that this war is in the name of god 

238.24 238.82 B: [noise] 

238.55 243.48 A: and that's basically what he said god came to him and said that this war was the right thing to do 

243.13 245.32 B: (( we got to turn that down [noise] )) 

245.56 247.01 A: (( i think that )) 

248.07 249.37 B: go ahead i'm listening 

249.42 260.87 A: i mean i think that when you put it into those terms then you're not doing anything different than what saddam hussein would be doing if he's ruling the country based on his religious beliefs 

260.78 266.75 A: and then you have george bush say that god came to him and said that this is the right thing to do 

265.42 268.10 B: see i didn't hear i i never heard that part 

268.25 270.59 B: [mn] i've never heard that 

268.79 269.87 A: it's on 

269.99 271.57 A: it's on a um 

272.68 277.84 A: what is it it's either u._s. news or time and you you see george bush 

277.85 283.70 A: on the front and it says bush and god and if you read the article it gives you some of the um 

284.59 291.29 A: some of the quotes as far as him saying like about the story behind what i'm talking to you about 

291.01 293.56 B: oh okay yeah i i never heard that part though 

293.58 297.53 A: yeah check it out i mean it's interesting to read 

296.81 300.34 B: yeah it would be it would be i i totally agree with you on that 

302.12 303.20 A: i mean 

303.34 306.36 A: like i said like i'm like i 

306.30 318.60 A: believe in like the freedom of speech and everything like that so i mean i respect your opinion but at the same time i don't feel like us going to iraq is really going to solve a lot of their problems because i mean 

318.75 322.48 A: if you just look at it from what's happened in the last couple of weeks 

323.34 326.49 A: we've taken away the stability of their country 

326.82 330.08 B: and they'll get it back twice and strong as it ever was 

326.93 327.73 A: (( so wh- )) 

330.41 331.83 A: but i mean when you se- 

330.83 338.82 B: we- we'll rebuild their country like it's never been before ou- our people here will suffer because money will go to them to rebuild 

339.15 340.88 A: and i i mean i that's w- 

340.30 342.22 B: did you see their hospitals 

341.66 345.89 A: i don't think that's right either like yeah i mean like 

343.94 350.10 B: have you have you have you seen their hospitals they're they're not i wouldn't put my dog in their hospitals 

346.29 347.44 A: (( yeah )) 

350.53 352.20 B: they're so dirty 

353.17 358.38 B: you think it's going to be like that in a couple of years after we get in there there's no way in hell it'll be like ours 

358.58 363.10 A: i don't think it'll be like i don't think it'd be like america 

362.15 363.26 B: yes it will 

363.56 364.47 A: (( i don't )) 

363.76 365.91 B: it'll be much better than what it is now 

366.69 368.13 A: and i think that 

368.37 374.45 A: [mn] if we're giving them a lot like a lot of stimulus packages i mean that's just going to [mn] bring our debt 

375.05 380.24 A: even further into the whole like since since george bush has been in the presidency 

380.31 387.13 A: [noise] the debt has just just keeps amounting and i don't think that with him as president it's ever going to [noise] 

387.78 390.11 A: be back to the plus 

394.17 396.69 A: but i guess that's a totally different issue 

394.42 396.54 B: i don't i i like him i 

396.82 399.54 B: i like him i think he did the right thing 

399.62 406.61 B: the only thing i disagree with is telling them step by step when we were going to attack instead of it being a surprise 

400.27 400.95 A: [noise] 

407.11 410.61 B: we should have went in there and bombed them the day after september eleventh 

411.89 417.61 A: but the day after september eleventh i mean they still had nothing to do with it like 

416.07 418.40 B: yeah they most certainly did 

420.53 424.32 A: like bombing iraq when they had nothing to do with 

425.65 430.28 A: with september eleventh that doesn't solve anything you you don't solve anything 

429.31 433.45 B: i wo- i would've taken the whole i would've blown the whole place off the face of the earth 

434.35 437.57 A: well what about the five million people that stay in baghdad 

437.89 438.63 B: that's 

438.94 440.87 B: that's the consequences of 

440.82 443.32 A: consequences of what you're going to take 

442.30 443.82 B: living where you live 

443.98 445.11 A: twenty peop- 

444.23 449.25 B: they allow these they allow these idiots to run the country over there 

445.44 446.63 A: listen to this 

448.06 460.50 A: well listen to this [mn] you have you hear george bush talking about we're going to kill the people that harbor terrorists the terrorists were living florida for like a year before they actually committed the crime 

455.71 456.49 B: (( right )) 

460.27 465.57 B: yeah we should've known that okay we should've known that they were here i 

463.84 476.52 A: but i'm saying if we're going to go out and bomb baghdad because they had terrorists living in their country then why shouldn't we be bombing washington d._c. if [laughter] they're living in our country [mn] 

474.10 476.40 B: well we should've known where they were 

476.49 478.97 B: we should've known where those gentlemen were 

481.35 483.88 A: that's true i know w- we should've 

482.54 485.94 B: i mean i we we should've known a lot more than you know 

486.08 498.55 A: but i like for me i don't think that it's right to say to somebody we're going to bomb your country and basically kill you because we don't agree with the things you say i mean 

500.58 503.13 A: [mn] iraq didn't bomb us 

503.15 508.74 A: if they had people living in that country that had something to do with it 

508.76 509.66 A: (( [mn] that's )) 

510.04 519.33 A: they really don't have any evidence uh to prove that but they do have evidence to prove that th- the members that were on the planes 

519.97 525.52 A: that killed many people during september eleventh did stay in the united states 

525.71 528.00 B: correct they were they were here for a while 

527.76 529.08 A: a long time 

528.03 530.93 B: we taught well we taught them how to fly the planes 

530.87 535.53 A: they paid taxes here i mean you know what i'm saying they learned everything from here 

533.01 537.79 B: (( yeah and we taught them how the we taught them that we taught them how to fly those planes )) 

538.08 540.92 B: they went to school here and we showed them how to do it 

543.29 550.56 A: i think that they should take every individual on a case by case basis instead of trying to lump everybody together 

553.33 554.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

555.54 556.30 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

559.30 560.97 A: (( [mn] but )) 

561.44 564.73 A: [mn] i don't know i just keep just keep watching the news 

564.40 567.37 B: yeah it's a shame though i mean there's a lot of innocent 

567.51 569.10 B: loss of life there 

571.89 575.75 B: and we've killed more of our own guys with friendly fire than they killed our guys 

577.86 579.76 A: mhm 

582.66 585.84 A: [mn] i mean i'm just waiting to see when they're actually going to 

586.91 592.79 A: like have substantial proof [noise] to show that saddam is actually dead 

592.36 593.79 B: i don't think he is 

594.03 595.60 A: i don't think he is either 

595.21 597.75 B: yeah i don't think he is i think he got out 

597.76 599.59 B: he's not that stupid
