221.50 224.42 A: when it was easy and we didn't have to worry about anything 

224.88 227.45 B: i just think it's really ridiculous when they're 

227.76 231.84 B: pulling people out of line for the um extra inspections that 

231.87 234.24 B: don't fit profiles of terrorists 

233.32 237.98 A: right yeah my sister gets pulled out every single time 

238.52 249.08 A: she is she's in her thirties she's a white american woman but every single time they manage to pull her out and go through her stuff and check her 

249.50 252.91 A: and it's like i don't get it you know but i think they're 

251.74 257.30 B: i never have and and you really you have to stereotype in this situation and profile because 

256.64 257.91 A: yeah 

257.42 268.59 B: terrorists all look a certain way usually i mean there's always wacko wacko caucasian people but right now the people that are causing terrorism are from a certain 

260.07 261.16 A: right 

268.92 269.96 B: group 

269.27 271.70 A: right yeah but i think they're try- 

270.39 275.05 B: they're they're males they're males eighteen to thirty five you know they're 

275.31 278.42 B: and they really have to profile because 

278.67 281.58 B: that's who the terrorists are 

280.72 284.59 A: right yeah but they're trying so hard to show that they're fair 

282.78 286.30 B: not eighty year old caucasian women [laughter] 

284.85 286.74 A: [laughter] 

287.10 288.22 A: i know 

288.04 291.98 B: and when you see a little grandma being pulled out of line it's just so ridiculous because 

290.76 292.49 A: [laughter] 

294.33 297.80 A: yeah they're not always thinking so clearly 

297.93 299.52 A: although now i was at 

298.56 301.39 B: well they're trying to be politically correct but 

300.70 302.03 A: yeah 

301.78 302.45 B: (( it's )) 

302.49 306.49 B: in this situation you can't be politically correct and worry about people's feelings 

306.55 307.21 B: [sigh] 

306.60 312.85 A: right i was really surprised i was at the airport last week 'cause i was doing some shopping at the airport 

312.86 314.16 A: and 

314.48 315.58 A: um 

315.73 327.54 A: a s- a person from the the company that that does all the that runs all of the stores and stuff had to take me through security and stay with my while i was in all of the areas 

327.55 335.86 A: but he just you know he had me following behind him we'd walk up to the security thing he'd show his badge and say she's with me and we'd walk on through 

336.38 341.37 A: and you know he stayed with me he had to but had he not been 

341.39 343.63 A: you know a reliable person 

343.84 348.16 A: any employee could walk someone else through the gate and just leave 'em over there 

349.85 351.56 A: (( so you know [sigh] )) 

351.71 355.60 A: i don't know there's just lots of other ways to get into trouble there 

355.70 357.86 B: yeah that's kinda scary um 

359.29 362.19 B: 'cause they could you know if they were getting paid off by 

362.68 364.98 B: a terrorist [laughter] to get 'em in 

364.05 365.48 A: yeah 

365.66 371.12 A: yeah you know and and we went we went past the security because it was icky outside 

371.00 385.02 A: he said when the weather is nice he doesn't even bother he goes outside and then goes around the outside of the airport so that he doesn't have to bother with the security people at all and it's like [sigh] it would be so easy to be trailing somebody through there 

385.00 389.13 A: you know and and [sigh] i don't know it just 

389.52 400.69 A: i don't know if they're asking us whether or not we think that terrorists could still cause trouble yeah i do [laughter] i i just it looked to me like it would be too easy for somebody to get in there 

402.44 403.39 A: (( but )) 

402.55 407.09 B: and i'm flying again next week [laughter] [sigh] 

404.81 407.83 A: oh you'll be fine 

408.36 417.47 A: it just doesn't it seem to you though that there have to be people out there still who support saddam and wanna get even with us now for causing trouble 

408.69 409.57 B: oh 

417.56 419.33 B: i'm sure there's wackos 

417.87 420.86 A: you know i mean they were mad at us before 

421.39 424.59 A: there there have to be a few people still working on their own 

424.86 437.51 B: but but our borders need to be tightened so they don't get in they're already here so it's too late but they're they let everybody in the borders it doesn't matter you know what country they're coming from they need to tighten the borders because 

429.24 430.18 A: (( i know )) 

437.50 444.77 B: you know in california our our state is just upside down as far as the deficit and a lot of it is because of 

442.84 444.16 A: mhm 

444.74 457.90 B: illegal immigration into california and and our taxes have to pay for services for these people and it's it's lots of different ethnic groups it's just not one in particular you know there's a majority that have immigrated here illegally but 

447.52 448.58 A: right 

457.60 458.53 A: right 

458.23 461.72 B: you know they need to tighten our borders for security reasons 

461.81 463.54 B: as well as the economy 

462.09 462.81 A: right 

463.69 472.15 A: well we yeah we have the problem with 'em too and you get the illegal immigrants or even just people emigrating here from other countries legally 

472.25 480.00 A: they not only come into the country but then they start insisting that all of the public services be available to them in their languages 

480.51 484.32 A: and and we bend over backwards to help absolutely everybody 

485.25 494.74 A: it's like why in the world am i paying you know for you to be able to have everything done in your language and i didn't ask you to come here [laughter] 

495.42 501.74 B: exactly but if they if they stop that if they just shut down the borders and didn't let 'em in 

502.82 505.73 B: we could monitor the tourists [laughter] more 

504.81 506.40 A: yeah 

505.81 514.17 B: but but they could sneak in through mexico because the borders aren't very tight and or sneak in from canada and they're here and 

514.96 516.61 B: once they're here we can't 

516.76 517.89 A: (( i know )) 

517.07 518.92 B: monitor their movements 

519.01 519.84 A: no 

520.34 522.40 B: if they come through legally 

520.34 521.22 A: i don't 

522.71 527.24 B: and they have visas or green cards or whatever it's easier to monitor their activity 

527.07 528.08 A: right 

528.47 536.50 A: and it's gonna it's gonna be harder for them to get cards and stuff now to come in legally 'cause there's there's no government for them to apply for them any more 

533.14 534.02 B: right 

537.59 542.43 A: i don't know i just i get really frustrated sometimes with our 

542.53 544.46 A: our open door policy 

545.18 549.48 A: you know it's just like a- let every- absolutely everybody in and 

550.25 565.02 A: we'll deal with it you know you've too many people and no control and and you always feel like the government knows more about what's going on than we do and that even though we're not aware of it they're taking care of us well 

565.07 567.67 A: kinda it was proven that they're not 

568.91 572.91 A: that they don't know what's going on and they're not out there stopping problems 

575.98 579.47 B: it's it's it's very frustrating being a citizen and 

580.62 581.75 B: and 

582.19 587.78 B: not having services available for you when you need 'em but somebody who comes in illegally gets more 

584.87 585.97 A: right 

588.36 591.06 B: benefits from the government than we do 

590.74 596.56 A: yeah well yeah and even you know when i was out doing those shops at the airport it was like 

597.21 599.89 A: counter after counter is there anybody here
