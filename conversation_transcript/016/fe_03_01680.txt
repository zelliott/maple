0.64 3.49 B: [noise] hi my name's pj [noise] 

3.80 5.76 A: hi my name is donna 

8.97 11.19 A: do you want to start or would you like me to start 

10.89 13.09 B: oh [laughter] you can [laughter] 

13.30 14.40 A: um 

14.49 27.78 A: i actually am really bad about following current events i watch a lot of cartoons unfortunately but what i do know is actually from my boyfriend who is from palestine so i guess it may be a little biased [laughter] 

20.21 21.45 B: (( [mn] )) 

27.92 30.93 B: well that must be like an interesting slant on it [laughter] 

31.25 32.10 B: (( because )) 

31.27 34.20 A: yeah i know it's very interesting actually 

35.43 37.85 B: [mn] [noise] does he relate like the 

38.82 42.31 B: events to palestine with events to iraq 

42.60 43.69 A: um 

43.81 46.50 A: a little bit i mean he just mainly talks about like 

46.82 51.12 A: more like you know the religion in the area and just the fact that um 

50.90 64.17 A: he doesn't really talk much about iraq i guess he is more like about palestine and jordan but he does talk a lot about like the people that live in that area and he was giving me like a whole history lesson like who exactly is considered arab and like the different religions in the area and stuff 

55.22 56.23 B: (( yeah oh )) 

64.35 65.79 B: wow yeah 

66.30 66.97 A: (( yeah )) 

67.26 70.21 A: i don't like war i'm very anti war [laughter] 

67.29 68.38 B: so far 

69.70 71.24 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

71.83 74.37 B: so am i i think maybe it had to be done 

74.50 76.66 B: but i'm like really glad it's over 

77.08 78.84 B: and 

78.02 82.27 A: i'm not yeah i'm with you i'm just not sure what exactly they thought that they were going to accomplish 

82.39 84.86 B: yeah i don't know but 

85.69 86.45 B: (( i guess )) 

86.90 89.70 B: i guess the regime change is the main thing though 

89.92 93.48 B: because now like the iraqi people have a chance to start over 

94.12 96.20 B: to at least you know 

96.46 104.89 B: i don't think they necessarily need to be free like have a be be free but i don't think they necessarily have to have like an american democracy 

104.55 105.67 A: right 

105.09 106.20 B: (( you know i mean )) 

106.25 108.83 B: just [mn] so they're not tortured and stuff 

109.26 110.96 A: i know i don't see 

111.07 112.04 A: i mean 

111.84 126.05 A: everybody does things differently and i just feel that you know that america shouldn't go in and like you know change because they they'd definitely want to change it to like capitalism or some type of government where like we could control in trade and and like and everybody benefit and to me that's just wrong 

119.59 120.93 B: exactly 

125.83 130.97 A: i mean not to say like i'm pro saddam but hopefully something good will come out of it 

126.17 127.07 B: yeah 

128.67 129.65 B: no i 

130.72 135.57 B: yeah i know what you mean because like in afghanistan right now people are having a fit because they're like 

135.37 146.76 B: the afghani government doesn't want them to watch eastern t._v. or whatever and stuff and it's like whoa okay [laughter] they're allowed to be different from us they don't have to be little america clones you know 

139.60 140.84 A: right 

146.06 147.62 A: yeah i know i 

147.67 153.41 B: i mean i love america and i'm glad i'm here i wouldn't want to live in one of those countries but that doesn't mean they have to be just like us 

153.29 162.82 A: yeah i know i definitely agree with you i'm kind of pissed off at america though for the simple fact that if you if you're trying to travel or go outside of america it's so hard now 

162.70 163.99 B: yeah 

163.42 166.26 A: like to leave the country if you want to travel 

167.35 168.19 B: yeah 

168.60 169.87 A: (( it's a pain )) 

169.90 170.96 B: [laughter] 

169.98 175.75 A: i don't know i wonder what type of government they're going to put in i'm sure they have like ideas already about who they want 

175.72 183.58 B: yeah i hope they i hope they let the iraqi people actually choose though because we really don't want america to appoint someone to go in there 'cause that would make no sense 

183.52 184.94 A: (( i know that would be awful )) 

183.83 184.61 B: that 

184.94 186.14 B: if we like put 

186.41 193.69 B: the army or something in charge that would it would sort of defeat the purpose of us going over there but 

193.61 197.59 A: i know i'm kind of mad like i feel like we weren't given the whole story either 

197.46 198.63 B: yeah 

197.85 209.38 A: i feel like we were fed like a lot of propaganda and it's just like we don't really know like what you know what hap- not what happened but i guess like i'm a bit of a skeptic so i'm like i never quite believe anything that i hear 

209.23 210.20 B: mhm 

209.58 216.37 A: so i'm like wondering like exactly there has to be something else because the war was kind of quick like it was all hyped up but then like now it's over 

216.31 222.82 B: yeah and if you watch like either like the different networks on television you will have like a totally different story 

222.92 225.78 B: and so it's like okay someone's not telling us the truth 

225.46 226.79 A: yeah i know i 

225.91 236.22 B: and it's and it's probably stuff like that they don't even know that they couldn't tell us that our government's just like concealing stuff just because that's the way it works in war you know there's propaganda and stuff 

237.42 246.06 B: like all the other wars that we have had like years later they'll say oh and now we've found out that this happened in the war and no-one knew at the time so 

246.07 248.85 B: (( i have a feeling there's going to be stuff like that about this war too )) 

248.88 253.86 A: know i wonder what happens when like you know like our kids or whatever are reading about this 

253.94 259.47 A: like what the books will say because you know when you read about like other wars y- you wonder like you know 

259.37 260.55 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

259.73 262.68 A: with wars like how much of the truth that is or 

264.38 270.94 A: i think it would be very interesting i hope it i hope there's no more like i hope they got their oil or whatever they wanted and we don't have to do this again 

266.20 267.08 B: yeah 

269.91 270.89 B: (( [sigh] )) 

271.02 272.76 B: yes i hope so too 

273.14 273.90 B: what 

273.35 276.34 A: and i blame florida for this [laughter] 

275.40 277.16 B: [laughter] 

276.55 280.73 A: if they if gore had been elected this probably wouldn't have happened 

280.36 281.45 B: [laughter] 

284.20 285.34 B: [laughter] 

285.26 287.91 A: is this the first time that you've done this phone thing 

287.76 289.27 B: yeah 

288.56 290.33 A: yeah me too [laughter] 

289.47 291.12 B: really [laughter] 

290.48 291.44 A: (( ahah )) 

291.46 292.47 B: yeah i just 

293.85 296.60 B: or something i don't know like three days ago i guess it 

296.91 297.64 A: (( yes )) 

297.22 299.03 B: (( [laughter] )) 

299.37 300.19 A: yeah 

299.58 300.74 B: where are you from 

300.88 302.05 A: saint thomas 

302.65 303.80 B: oh cool 

303.68 304.60 A: yeah 

304.42 305.08 B: (( cool )) 

305.39 306.90 B: i'm from pennsylvania 

306.87 314.37 A: oh really what part i just bought ferrets like outside of philadelphia [laughter] so i know yeah [laughter] it's like i'm more interested in 

307.72 308.54 B: yeah 

311.10 312.18 B: oh really 

312.81 314.01 B: i'm more 

314.45 315.84 B: (( of i'm more of )) 

316.31 317.12 A: (( oh )) 

318.26 321.23 B: a like and everything's related to that [laughter] 

320.85 321.78 A: [laughter] 

323.45 328.79 A: like what else i don't know i wish i knew more about like the war but i really do not pay attention 

328.63 332.25 B: [laughter] it's hard not to i like 

333.00 340.77 B: where i go to school they have it on everywhere like like everybody has the t._v.s and radios on too find it hard to avoid 

340.78 348.86 B: i'm like deliberately like okay this is enough war stuff i've got to stop watching it because it it just gets overwhelming you know 

348.22 350.42 A: yeah it yeah i guess so 

350.44 351.33 B: and it gets 

350.80 353.91 A: i don't know i just feel uh it's unfortunate that 

354.11 355.07 A: um 

355.08 365.13 A: i guess because i wasn't like directly directly affected like you know there weren't any drafts and there weren't you know so i didn't i tried not to pay attention i was very successful [laughter] 

360.77 361.68 B: yeah 

365.20 366.51 B: [laughter] 

367.59 374.98 A: so yeah i'm more like i guess because of my boyfriend i'm more like interested in what's going on in like palestine and israel and stuff like that 

374.07 374.81 B: oh 

376.09 378.39 B: (( it's weird because you are hearing about )) 

379.68 381.50 B: (( so involved with themselves they are )) 

381.58 388.72 A: yeah i know it's so bad it was so sad he um his grandmother died and he tried to go home to palestine and they like wouldn't like let him into the country 

388.73 390.17 B: really 

389.44 392.01 A: so he just had to like turn around and come back 

392.17 393.74 B: oh man 

393.61 395.03 A: yeah so it really 

395.28 398.47 B: just because like the u._s. palestine relations or 

398.23 400.34 A: well more because like um 

400.50 413.67 A: [mn] see his mum is from jordan his dad is from palestine and like apparently there's three check points and like his dad is actually one of the ministers of palestine so it was more because of that that they were like yeah they were like no go back [laughter] 

410.31 411.39 B: oh wow 

413.55 414.18 B: [laughter] 

415.23 416.05 A: (( so )) 

417.96 418.95 B: does he ever 

418.17 419.07 A: wow 

419.28 421.64 A: i'm like is it not ten minutes yet [laughter] 

421.51 422.51 B: really 

422.66 426.28 B: does he ever think there will be peace over there with palestine and israel [sigh] 

426.30 427.77 A: i don't know 

428.04 430.66 A: i don't know religion is so funny like 

430.67 436.01 A: [mn] my friends say religion has killed more people than like all diseases combined or something and i don't 

434.64 435.71 B: [laughter] 

436.94 438.03 A: (( i don't )) 

438.04 438.96 A: (( know )) 

439.71 443.87 B: it's so weird because religion really does like even like in um 

443.90 449.57 B: ireland it's like protestants and catholics fighting over here you don't even think about that 

449.27 450.41 A: i know 

449.76 451.87 B: it seems so weird to have 

451.90 454.08 A: people still fighting over religion 

453.74 458.93 B: yeah and that's like crusades that's like ancient history [laughter] 

458.09 460.01 A: i know that's how it feels 

460.31 461.16 A: (( i don't )) 

462.43 463.51 A: (( i don't know )) 

463.62 470.07 A: it's a lot of like i don't know religion and racism and everything else it's just like stuff like that will never go away so i just wonder 

469.92 471.00 B: yeah 

470.33 471.77 A: what will happen 

471.71 481.06 B: i'm afraid this war has sparked more like racism and like september eleventh and stuff like people see someone who is arabic and get all paranoid and stuff just because they're arabic 

481.03 482.11 A: (( i know )) 

482.31 485.59 B: it just seems like wrong [laughter] just like no 

486.46 491.45 A: it was so sad i remember like um a month after september eleventh i got in a taxi cab 

491.26 492.17 B: mhm 

491.49 496.05 A: and um the guy had a thing that was like i am not like 

496.18 499.15 A: i am not from such and such i am like 

499.22 509.06 A: something else you know just trying to explain it like i am a peaceful people or if you're curious about my religion and put like a link up and that's like really sad that you have to like justify who you are 

506.01 506.60 B: (( yeah )) 

508.84 510.14 B: yeah 

509.21 514.81 A: so it's like people were i felt so bad it was like it almost made me want to cry when i like got in the cab i was like absolutely 

514.59 515.48 B: (( it )) 

515.78 517.33 B: (( is )) 

519.75 522.50 B: [noise] probably in reaction to stuff people said though 

522.71 524.15 B: which is awful 

523.10 524.21 A: yeah 

525.85 527.35 A: (( it is bad )) 

527.77 531.65 A: i guess everyone kind of felt that initial like you know anger and like 

531.76 536.52 A: you know hatred but it shouldn't like i mean of course everyone got mad but then for 

531.80 532.81 B: yeah 

536.55 539.87 A: people to just you know act on it it's awful
