1.96 3.20 A: hello 

3.31 4.89 B: hi this is andy 

4.55 6.15 A: hi this is stephanie 

6.15 7.57 B: hi stephanie how are you 

7.26 8.33 A: just fine 

8.36 9.98 B: good 

10.29 12.95 B: well [laughter] an interesting an 

12.92 14.30 A: (( yeah )) 

13.12 19.30 B: interesting topic [laughter] so what what do you think 

14.63 16.71 A: yes it is [mn] 

18.48 23.47 A: well i don't know there was a lot to to have to talk about there 

24.38 25.41 A: um 

25.62 28.99 A: i think that peace will never be 

25.63 26.89 B: yeah 

30.03 30.92 A: brought 

31.65 34.45 A: what was it peace to be brought over there 

34.22 35.48 B: (( yeah ahah )) 

34.92 41.26 A: yeah i don't think they'll ever arrive at peace but i think they will try to come to peace [cough] 

39.79 45.47 B: mhm yep well i i agree with you there i don't think there ever will be 

44.77 49.80 A: and i com- i agree completely that the u._s. should be over there helping them 

49.94 50.81 B: yeah 

50.26 52.21 A: i think that was one of the things 

52.15 58.04 B: yep i would i would agree with that as well i think yeah um 

58.22 63.23 B: you know it's going to be a challenge to maintain our our involvement in a 

63.24 64.31 B: (( in a )) 

65.18 68.32 B: way that's acceptable to to both the 

68.43 70.81 B: middle east and the rest of the world but 

70.44 71.22 A: (( [mn] )) 

71.40 83.18 B: um but ah it it perhaps can be done i think the real challenge is going to be seeing how we deal with this first step of iraq and getting a 

83.66 86.17 B: a stable government established so 

86.05 88.89 A: (( yeah and how they are going to accept it )) 

89.11 94.33 A: because they have lived in this type of environment since jesus's time 

94.59 100.23 A: and that's you know going to be something to have to overcome on their part because it's gonna be so 

100.27 102.55 A: completely different i think 

102.48 107.35 B: yep well i i yes i mean i think the the ah 

107.49 108.54 B: um 

108.82 113.09 B: democratic rule um is a little bit ah 

113.38 115.37 B: ah unusual for 

115.90 117.30 B: for that part of the world 

117.67 119.78 B: i'm sure it will be interesting to see how 

120.09 124.89 B: if it can be established and and once it is established if it can be maintained 

124.78 125.87 A: yeah 

125.06 125.78 B: (( um )) 

125.88 126.96 B: so 

127.03 131.54 A: yeah and i i do think that they should have done this years and years ago 

132.37 135.84 A: ah you know they should have you know at least gotten 

136.13 142.32 A: all those terrorists out of there and got them under control whenever they first had the chance 

142.08 147.42 B: mhm well it's a difficult a difficult question the the 

147.44 152.86 B: the relative ease of which it was done this time ah was probably 

152.88 156.36 B: due in a large part to the fact that that we have had 

155.81 156.49 A: [mn] 

156.53 158.39 B: ah a number of years of 

158.82 162.86 B: of time to improve the technology and to ah to 

163.79 165.66 B: be able to precision bomb 

165.88 168.58 B: and so forth and so had it been 

168.67 172.40 B: had it been done in the first gulf war that would have that would have been 

172.88 180.90 B: the the best time to to do it um but you never know what what the results would have been then so i guess 

180.21 181.97 A: that's true yeah 

181.02 182.70 B: better late than never 

182.78 184.34 A: yeah you never know 

184.55 185.35 B: (( so )) 

185.45 187.34 B: (( yeah ahah )) 

189.78 192.26 A: so do you think that they will arrive at peace 

193.58 200.33 B: no i i don't think they will because ah i mean for there to be peace in the middle middle east um 

200.40 204.73 B: there has to be peace with israel and there won't won't be peace with israel ah 

205.04 205.93 B: (( ah )) 

206.80 208.88 B: ah until the lord comes so 

208.96 211.07 A: that's right [laughter] 

210.15 213.35 B: [laughter] [laughter] so 

214.08 216.39 B: (( that a )) 

214.93 215.57 A: (( [mn] )) 

216.65 221.02 B: that's a challenge that that won't be met until then 

221.09 229.40 A: yeah [noise] yeah but i do i really do think that they are gonna try but it is going to be extremely difficult i think for them to 

230.24 231.49 A: (( to [noise] )) 

231.94 233.32 A: learn how to 

233.38 236.20 A: to live a completely different way you know 

236.97 239.95 B: yeah i i i agree but but 

240.31 252.51 B: um people are people are pretty adaptable and and ah so there will be there will be a lot of sorting out but fortunately in in iraq there's there's a pretty good um 

252.58 256.75 B: basic internal structure in terms of roads and 

257.35 258.59 B: um 

259.04 263.20 B: you know utilities and and that type of thing so um 

262.87 265.47 A: [noise] 

263.28 264.19 B: (( there's )) 

265.35 267.46 B: certainly a long way to go but ah 

268.31 271.35 B: i think that um 

271.66 275.78 B: that it won't take as long as as it might in another country that 

276.06 277.07 B: um 

277.53 278.13 A: (( yeah )) 

277.63 279.51 B: was further 

278.92 280.16 A: [noise] 

280.18 281.80 B: more backward 

281.80 286.83 A: oh you think see i don't know you know i have never really studied 

286.84 288.03 A: the other 

288.92 292.63 A: places but i would think that like africa would be you 

293.01 294.96 A: know faster to 

295.51 302.10 A: to catch on to democracy than than like the israelites and stuff like that 

302.60 304.58 B: i don't know it's an interesting ah 

304.77 307.13 B: it's an interesting thought um 

307.45 314.95 B: i think the i think one of the differences and one of the reasons that that democracy um 

314.01 315.26 A: (( [noise] )) 

315.36 324.78 B: ah works is because there is a capitalistic mentality of of trying to build and and ah improve 

324.81 325.78 B: (( ah )) 

325.90 327.28 B: improve ah 

328.25 331.33 B: overall life and and to have people who 

331.46 339.57 B: in that structure ah you know foreign companies create jobs and and you know really really go about trying to 

339.67 340.58 B: to 

340.70 353.11 B: create an economic prosperity and i think that situation is probably further um further along than perhaps some areas of africa and um 

353.18 354.25 B: but ah 

353.94 355.74 A: i never thought of it that way 

355.93 358.22 B: (( mhm mhm so )) 

357.45 359.81 A: but i guess that's right you know 

361.19 370.15 A: it's just we we have friends that are missionaries over in africa and they are so open to to different ideas whereas i don't know 

370.44 371.18 A: if 

371.20 379.58 A: iraq is going to be that open you know because they are going to be just scared and afraid and everything's just gonna be so different for them 

374.01 375.29 B: mhm 

379.72 393.75 B: well i i i think they they have certainly seen what much of the rest of the world lives like and and they they ah um they are going they're obviously overreacting to 

393.72 401.77 B: um you know not having a government control um and ah so but i think by the same token they ah 

396.42 397.38 A: yeah 

401.79 402.75 B: um 

402.97 403.71 B: um 

404.30 409.20 B: you know that that if that's contained and a structure is brought in 

409.26 411.80 B: i think the challenge is going to be in in who 

411.86 422.63 B: gets the nod as the as the leader of choice ah to set up a new government and that's that's gonna be very difficult because th- th- there are very differing 

422.73 427.88 B: ah religious sects and and all ah that are there like it ah 

427.92 434.45 B: um extremely challenging to put in a kind of a of a united government together i think 

433.52 435.04 A: (( yeah )) 

437.42 439.85 A: i am trying to look down to see what time it is here 

441.70 443.04 A: three more minutes 

443.77 445.36 A: [mn] um 

444.90 447.58 B: (( mhm so )) 

447.55 450.93 A: i can't remember the other things that they said to talk about 

451.67 452.94 A: world peace 

451.98 454.78 B: really go ahead 

454.39 456.86 A: world peace what else was the other ones 

458.27 459.46 B: um 

460.11 461.60 B: i don't remember either 

461.07 462.47 A: [laughter] 

462.09 465.20 B: [laughter] so 

466.25 467.12 B: um 

467.91 471.21 B: yeah it's been a pretty a pretty amazing 

472.22 473.40 B: few weeks 

473.15 474.46 A: yes it has 

473.66 475.48 B: since it started so 

474.93 479.82 A: yeah and it's amazing in comparison to you know like past wars 

479.94 481.94 B: mhm 

479.94 486.89 A: you know the the updating and and people are able to get information right away and stuff like that 

486.95 489.58 B: it really is ah it really is incredible 

486.98 487.87 A: whereas 

489.31 490.78 A: yeah it is 

491.38 494.83 A: i don't know if i really like it that much or not but [laughter] 

494.31 496.79 B: well you have a choice as to whether you watch it or not i 

496.34 497.44 A: yeah 

496.72 508.14 B: think if if it didn't exist then you wouldn't then you wouldn't have a choice to to ah be able to turn it down and i think you know at a point it it became very repetitive and and and not really 

505.62 506.76 A: yeah 

508.01 516.03 B: ah informative by the same token you you knew that they were there and that if there was anything that was significant that was taking place that ah 

512.40 513.08 A: [mn] 

516.03 525.96 B: we would probably hear about it so um that's i think that's a very different way to to fight a war and and um 

517.55 518.69 A: yeah 

526.03 526.96 B: so 

527.06 532.22 B: i think i think overall it was ah it was very positive like i say you can choose to 

532.42 534.65 B: turn it off and ignore it or 

534.46 535.44 A: yeah 

534.81 536.27 B: (( ah or participate )) 

535.73 549.93 A: well you know i was i was just thinking of the people that had family and and friends there that you know i would be like glued if one of my family members were there and then it would be upsetting knowing 

549.93 555.31 A: that troop was there and then you know casualties and not knowing 

554.81 555.90 B: sure 

555.63 556.55 A: yeah 

556.65 559.92 B: yeah yeah well i
