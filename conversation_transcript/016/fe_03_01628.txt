91.06 92.05 B: oh 

94.14 95.38 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

95.11 99.17 A: so th- the question was about the middle east about peace correct 

98.68 99.90 B: yes 

99.91 104.75 A: [mn] um i personally feel like i'm not big into war 

104.87 108.06 A: and but i really feel something needed to be done 

108.18 112.19 A: because i personally feel the conditions over there are terrible 

109.93 112.82 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

112.22 114.20 A: and saddam hussein 

114.53 115.66 A: i just think 

115.71 118.33 A: is crazy and needed to be stopped 

117.91 118.73 B: mhm 

118.56 119.66 A: [mn] how about you 

119.39 121.42 B: [mn] well i'll tell you i am 

121.65 127.20 B: [noise] [mn] i'm a relatively new mom i mean i have a three year old and um 

125.91 126.67 A: (( oh )) 

127.10 141.56 B: i find that because i'm working full time as well that i don't have h- time to really make sure that i have the full range of news and information that i need to kind of make what i consider to be a very well informed 

141.78 145.61 B: decision or or thought about this issue 

144.55 146.46 A: that's a very good point 

145.87 150.26 B: and um because i spent a couple of years in the um 

150.55 159.16 B: [mn] excuse me because i spent a couple of years in the air force [mn] i really um h- have this kind of bigger picture 

159.43 161.97 B: perspective of things of 

162.04 174.38 B: kind of relying on our elected officials and the political process to really bring about um a situation that is for the time perhaps the most positive and 

174.47 176.05 B: (( ah [mn] )) 

176.33 185.92 B: although it will all kind of take time to kind of see how it plays out um i guess i have faith in our political system 

185.99 199.78 B: to be leading us in a direction that is um that is right and if it's not right then the political process will make a change so i i guess it's not very specific to the peace process 

200.04 214.73 B: specifically but i um and to the war that we're currently involved in right now um but i guess i put a lot of trust and faith into our system not necessarily bush because i'm not necessary supportive of him personally i didn't vote for him 

214.23 215.93 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

214.93 224.27 B: but um [lipsmack] you know just the system as a whole do you a- do you have some thoughts actually i'm real curious about your thoughts about 

220.88 221.67 A: [noise] 

224.21 233.77 B: um not just iraq but the um israeli excuse me the israeli palestinian conflict which i think is even more 

233.89 235.08 B: difficult 

235.15 238.78 B: of an issue to see that it can possibly be resolved 

238.82 240.20 A: [sigh] i 

240.58 246.23 A: i really don't know like i i i have to agree with you ah well i'm a new mom myself i 

244.81 246.94 B: uh-huh oh congratulations 

246.54 250.52 A: i have a twenty two month old and i also have a nine week old 

249.94 251.46 B: oh my goodness 

251.05 254.57 A: so it's very difficult to sit down and read a paper 

253.23 254.95 B: [laughter] 

254.74 259.05 A: and just very busy so i have to agree with you as far as 

259.17 269.09 A: not knowing like sitting down and knowing all the facts [noise] [mn] i i agree with you there um and it is very hard but you you on the other hand can you said you were in the air force 

261.88 263.57 B: mhm 

268.47 270.00 B: (( mhm )) 

270.14 284.04 A: that to me you you get to see what's happening like in the military and yo- you've had that experience and everything that you kind of know what's happening and [mn] not fully but you know you've had that experience 

283.60 290.48 B: well right well i w- i was in a long time ago and it was actually kind of curious i was in during the gulf war [lipsmack] 

289.89 290.86 A: okay 

290.67 293.10 B: and um i actually felt 

293.13 295.86 B: very connected to 

295.83 301.41 B: um to what was going on there because it just seemed more real it seemed more present 

300.53 302.46 A: [noise] mhm 

301.36 311.07 B: and it was actually very surreal to me when the iraq war began um and the work that i'm doing now 

311.47 320.87 B: which is completely different um from my air force experience um i i work for a town i'm the assistant town administrator for a small town outside of boston 

320.88 325.82 B: and i was in a staff meeting righ- right after the war broke out and [mn] 

326.26 328.09 B: i was just sitting there 

328.23 339.62 B: as a discussion came up about how many reservists we have working for the town turned out no one no one works for the town ah no one who works for the town is a reservist which really shocked me 

335.32 336.22 A: [laughter] 

338.90 339.94 A: (( [noise] [noise] hm )) 

339.62 345.03 B: and it was just amazing sitting in that meeting thinking oh my god this is so surreal 

344.96 356.98 B: there's there's no connection there's no connection whatsoever to this war whereas before during the last war there was such a strong connection because of the work that i was 

357.22 358.52 B: doing so 

357.64 359.07 A: yeah 

358.58 359.51 B: um 

359.29 372.64 A: yeah [mn] but i i mean it's a very scary thought raising a child in today's age and i would like to think peace could come out of this but i seriously doubt it will 

365.27 367.78 B: mhm 

372.86 373.98 A: um 

374.49 376.46 A: you have many people 

376.80 379.22 A: over there right now who 

379.93 380.85 A: just 

381.15 382.71 A: object to the u._s. 

383.11 385.39 A: forces being in iraq 

384.79 386.66 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

385.66 389.57 A: and i i you know you just who knows 

390.05 397.36 A: [noise] who that their um their government who is still alive who is dead and you know 

397.38 403.35 A: will we ever know who knows and i really feel that there's going to be some retaliation somehow 

398.79 399.62 B: right 

403.39 404.80 A: against us 

404.51 406.29 B: (( right )) 

404.88 418.13 A: whether it's like th- the nine eleven attacks or you know s- s- some way i think something's going to happen hopefully not as horrible as that but you just don't know 

417.73 419.34 B: yeah 

418.34 421.74 A: and i mean i know one thing um [lipsmack] 

422.32 435.67 A: the u._s. is trying to do over there is find find their weapons i mean has that been done yet do you know have they found any of the ma- the weapons of mass destruction that we've been searching for 

427.59 428.38 B: yes 

430.17 431.08 B: well 

433.46 434.63 B: well i 

435.23 440.32 B: i think it depends how you define weapons of mass destruction i think that that the typical 

440.35 453.93 B: way that it's defined as far as um nukes and things like that haven't been found but significant um excuse me some significant chemical weapons and chemicals i suppose have been 

453.93 456.56 B: have been found um but 

456.74 460.22 B: not a huge huge smoking gun yet so 

459.54 461.11 A: i i mean my 

461.20 466.94 A: my uncle we were talking about this briefly yesterday my uncle was saying about he 

466.96 474.90 A: it's not that he's not in favor of the war but he's not in complete agreement with it but he [laughter] he said that he wouldn't be surprised if at some point 

475.25 485.42 A: weapons of mass destruction are found whether they're found legitimately or we plant them and find them [mn] but just so we can put people's mind at ease type of thing 

484.94 485.81 B: hm 

485.49 490.33 A: but i i don't w- i don't know do you think the u._s. would ever do something like that 

490.64 505.39 B: i would certainly hope not i think that um the testimony that we're beginning to get back from um people about the way life was in iraq under saddam's merg- regime are kind of significant enough 

505.74 515.32 B: for a lot of people at least to recognize that um that life for a great number of people of iraqis wasn't truly free and 

515.25 522.99 B: um that to me is perhaps an even more important issue that what bombs um they may have had 

518.25 518.82 A: (( [noise] )) 

522.36 524.08 A: true true 

524.10 527.20 A: that's true but i know i mean it's just 

527.87 531.48 A: [lipsmack] i just don't know about peace though th- that's my 

531.63 536.03 A: [lipsmack] i just don't know if if that will happen or not and [noise] i'm sure 

536.06 539.64 A: people didn't think this war would probably be even lasting this long 

538.59 539.78 B: [noise] 

539.90 547.20 A: and i mean is there really is there i haven't been watching the news lately is there even bombing going on right now or anything 

546.68 552.57 B: no [noise] no there's not um we're hearing now of occasional sni- 

547.59 548.51 A: okay 

552.52 563.50 B: occasional um sniper attacks on individual troops ah but um it seems to be pretty more or less over the significant portion 

555.23 556.19 A: okay 

557.11 558.13 A: okay 

562.75 563.74 A: okay 

563.61 567.31 B: of the war i think there was actually um 

567.67 568.49 B: (( ah )) 

568.30 577.66 B: surprise from a lot of people's parts that it did actually conclude or seem to wrap up this quickly as it has gi- given [sigh] 

577.44 584.26 B: given how ah this is probably one of the first times that we as a country have invaded another country 

583.67 585.08 A: mhm 

584.42 586.58 B: without defen- 

586.85 588.53 B: [mn] without defending 

589.46 599.48 B: ah friends if that makes sense i mean the last time with the iraqi war was involved with kuwait and defending kuwait um but to aggressively 

595.49 596.62 A: mhm
