8.97 11.19 B: illinois oh that's not too far away 

11.14 12.16 A: no 

12.03 13.16 B: [laughter] 

13.13 16.46 A: so the topic what do ya think about it 

13.44 14.45 B: okay 

16.57 17.68 B: well [sigh] 

17.66 30.38 B: i guess like if you go to foreign countries they say that that that's just a common thing that people are around there you know and the security is very very high so i don't know i guess we're used to being at being low i don't know 

30.33 36.24 B: we don't travel that much by airplane but we did go to boise for the iowa state football game 

36.46 45.22 B: and of course got caught up in oh two or three different times and it was right over the new year too so the the rules had changed 

45.46 46.56 B: so we got 

46.65 52.83 B: oh we got oh we had to go over and they uh run our luggage through another thing and then uh 

53.15 58.51 B: before we got on the plane we were taken off to the side practically everybody was on that plane 

58.63 64.01 B: and then when we went back they even [cough] they even went through our stuff so 

64.29 69.35 B: i don't know you know i i think it probably would catch some but i don't know if it'd catch all of it 

70.51 71.62 B: what do you think 

72.77 83.14 A: well i went to tennessee not long ago and [laughter] the airports were totally different in what they looked for it was weird i um 

82.62 83.71 B: oh 

83.82 85.73 A: went in the first one 

86.20 90.50 A: and i didn't realise i had a butane lighter in my purse 

90.48 92.54 B: oh yeah 

90.67 91.59 A: okay 

92.24 103.16 A: yeah and i got right through i mean they searched my purse they searched me i had to take my shoes off they felt my seat under my socks everything in chicago 

103.48 104.53 B: mhm 

103.99 105.44 A: (( then i'm )) 

105.57 107.16 A: coming back 

107.32 109.33 A: in tennessee airport 

109.82 113.73 A: all of a sudden i'm surrounded by 

113.93 120.57 A: like six guards ma'am will you come over here please you know and it's like what'd i do what'd i do you know 

115.47 116.46 B: really 

119.28 120.53 B: (( [sigh] )) 

120.67 123.67 A: and it was a butane lighter [laughter] 

123.36 124.64 B: oh 

124.40 126.29 A: they confiscated it and everything 

126.37 129.90 A: so then they take me over to the private area to do a search 

130.26 133.68 A: and she doesn't even have me take my shoes off 

133.92 134.63 B: (( hm )) 

134.90 139.07 A: you know and they they even buzzed because they had metal in 'em 

138.80 140.44 B: mhm 

139.85 143.70 A: now that could've been a knife that could've been a gun that could've been anything 

142.20 144.82 B: (( could've been something yeah )) 

144.08 148.11 A: and i walked right through it now that doesn't make sense to me 

147.74 158.40 B: yeah i don't think there's any organized method of what what's happening you know i think that they all have to have the same sort of the same kind of rules or whatever or 

158.48 161.72 B: or it probably isn't going to be as successful as it could be 

161.83 163.29 A: mhm 

163.45 171.75 A: but i think it's important that we have the security with all the hijackings i've always thought the security was a little lax 

166.12 167.48 B: oh yeah 

171.38 178.81 B: right right it just seems like we have to have something tragic happen for us to be shaken up a little bit and 

172.13 172.96 A: (( ya know )) 

179.28 181.27 B: you know change things some 

183.30 184.74 A: yeah and it's sad 

185.17 186.74 A: it's really sad 

186.87 188.41 A: but 

188.56 191.36 A: at least i do feel a little bit safer 

191.18 192.80 B: mhm 

192.24 199.48 A: but then my girlfriend um wasn't even thinking and and she bought a sword for her son 

199.50 200.44 B: (( uh-huh )) 

200.02 202.26 A: they got it through the airport with it 

203.12 204.13 B: she did 

203.50 205.65 A: in her yeah in her luggage 

206.05 206.85 B: oh 

207.13 209.75 A: it was a sword inside of a case 

210.08 215.66 A: and it was a fancy sword like that you would get like over in india or something ya know 

214.48 216.57 B: uh-huh yeah 

216.79 219.68 A: and went right through and she got home and she goes 

219.87 222.10 A: i forgot all about that 

222.16 222.88 B: hm 

222.47 225.49 A: and she says they never even questioned it 

225.39 227.40 B: well that seems funny 

226.86 228.09 A: mhm 

228.77 233.66 B: they must be looking for i don't know you know maybe they're looking for certain things that we don't even 

228.91 230.48 A: exactly 

233.93 237.99 B: i don't know 'cause they searched ours and we didn't you know we got nothing in there we had 

238.46 247.52 B: well they messed up the suitcases you know [laughter] but i mean we had um oh we had done some shopping you know we had a few stuff but it wasn't anything you know 

248.20 260.62 B: i had gotten a nativity scene it was a glass or something and they couldn't figure out what that was but they said it was all right i said oh it's a you know and i told him oh okay that's what that is you know it's like 

261.63 263.48 B: you know sort of weird but 

263.63 270.13 A: well the way the planes are designed today they can't even get down to the um luggage can they 

270.34 272.03 A: from inside the plane 

272.13 273.75 B: well i wouldn't think so 

275.28 278.64 B: so i would think you know anything down there should be fine 

278.89 282.30 A: yeah maybe that's why she got through with a sword i don't know 

283.60 289.17 B: although they do they do you know they check that stuff too though before they take it in but 

288.68 289.67 A: (( uh-huh )) 

290.01 290.57 A: (( [mn] )) 

292.39 293.72 A: i don't know 

294.18 295.43 A: i have no clue 

294.23 294.84 B: (( mm )) 

295.47 296.70 A: [laughter] 

296.14 297.54 B: [laughter] 

297.57 298.95 B: yeah 

298.80 299.73 A: so 

300.72 301.55 B: so you 

301.02 304.73 A: but that that was about my only experience and 

305.53 308.26 A: and i sit there too and i wonder 

311.11 318.19 A: that's just getting on the plane how much danger is there right in the airport and i think maybe they should have 

318.48 321.39 A: i don't like the fact that you can't go 

321.75 326.13 A: to see your people off any more like when i took my grandson and 

326.59 333.56 A: my daughter they were going back to arizona and you have to be there an hour or two beforehand 

329.01 330.12 B: mhm 

332.95 333.84 B: right 

333.95 342.33 A: and it would've been nice to have been able to be down there with them until they got on the plane and seen them off and everything i miss that 

342.27 344.44 B: oh you you can't do that any more 

344.20 346.32 A: mm mm you can't do that any more 

346.11 346.95 B: (( hm )) 

347.46 348.22 A: (( mm mm )) 

347.75 351.54 B: as i say we don't we don't travel as much by plane that you know 

351.65 355.55 B: [sigh] every time we go it's gonna be new it seems like you know because 

351.82 352.65 A: yeah 

356.00 357.13 B: but 

356.58 364.13 A: they wouldn't let me in and like the shops and all that are suffering you can't get in there but yet the people that are travelling 

364.58 367.16 A: they go back there and i don't 

367.21 370.55 A: well yeah i guess you are searched before you get back to that part 

370.69 371.79 B: yeah 

373.06 374.34 A: but um 

374.99 381.68 A: i i think maybe it's a little overboard in some areas and then other areas it's probably a little lax 

381.49 389.50 B: right right just like well like going in the sporting events too we go to like iowa state football and you know there was supposedly be 

389.93 394.85 B: you know more security and this and that but i don't know you know 

395.34 403.42 B: i know you're not supposed to take water in or something you know and you stick it in your coat and it goes in you know they don't check it that much but 

404.07 405.11 B: (( i don't know )) 

405.75 412.12 B: and you know there's booze and stuff in it bec- people get that in there 'cause you see the bottles [sigh] when you go to leave [laughter] 

411.40 412.51 A: yeah 

413.32 414.64 A: exactly 

414.26 418.68 B: and i don't think they have any metal detectors there you know 

416.68 417.77 A: (( [cough] )) 

419.02 419.83 B: (( but )) 

421.73 424.14 A: well do you feel safe flying 

424.31 425.03 B: (( huh )) 

425.17 427.90 A: do you feel safe flying now 

428.24 440.10 B: well yeah i guess uh probably no diff- not a whole lot of difference than before you know it's just that it seems to be more more of a hassle but i that's all right you know as long as it's gonna if it's gonna be safer 

440.33 441.35 A: yeah 

440.62 441.56 B: (( you know )) 

442.85 447.85 B: but i think i think they have to iron out some of the bugs and stuff as to 

448.01 450.94 B: you know so it doesn't take so long and all that stuff 

453.05 453.61 B: (( [mn] )) 

453.22 456.55 A: well while you're waiting around in the airport i mean 

456.59 460.65 A: there's still opportunities for terrorists 

460.73 462.54 B: oh yeah yeah 

461.78 465.77 A: you know in the airport and i would think well 

466.13 469.52 A: if you really had a terrorist gonna attach 

469.90 470.96 A: um 

471.53 478.90 A: sure so far they've always attacked a plane but what's to keep them from attacking the whole airport 

478.69 480.53 B: (( right right )) 

479.95 484.85 A: you know and i don't really feel there's enough security that way 

485.23 486.22 A: um 

486.43 490.50 A: yeah they limit 'em from getting back to where they aboard but 

491.04 495.59 A: there's still a majority of the airport that's open to everybody 

495.13 496.88 B: right i mean you hear 

495.68 497.12 A: i think maybe 

497.41 506.41 B: isolated incidents of you know so and so got through the security with a gun or it got through you know and you're wondering well how is this happening [laughter] you know 

506.32 507.69 A: exactly 

507.45 508.82 B: yeah 

508.51 512.70 A: and i i have to wonder too how many people that work there 

512.77 514.87 A: um aren't involved 

516.37 518.24 A: that these people through 

516.76 517.79 B: (( oh yeah )) 

517.80 525.14 B: yeah i mean it's just like those pilots and that you know they had a pilot license and everything and you know 

518.51 519.60 A: you know 

525.72 529.50 B: got on those planes and nobody knew any different 

529.79 533.20 A: and how well are they checked by their coworkers 

531.57 533.80 B: right right mm 

535.88 536.95 A: so 

536.56 537.12 B: (( mm )) 

539.40 545.43 A: i think maybe they should have something just anybody who enters the building should be checked before they go 

545.79 548.69 A: in the building instead of half way through the building 

548.98 550.12 B: right 

549.27 551.42 A: if they're if they're gonna do it 

551.01 560.17 B: right as you come in the doors you know that's the first check yeah because otherwise you get it in there you could put it somewhere and you know go back for it or whatever 

553.02 554.02 A: mhm 

554.80 556.07 A: and as you're 

558.44 559.71 A: exactly 

560.63 561.77 A: yeah 

562.40 563.72 A: so 

564.18 568.64 A: i don't know i i feel if they're gonna do security let's do a whole security thing 

569.16 572.89 A: check everybody with a metal detector when they walk in 

573.00 574.16 B: mhm 

573.59 574.60 A: um 

575.64 582.62 A: and very possibly have the employees checked by a minimum of two other employees 

583.29 587.40 B: right they should be able to or should b- go through something too before they go in 

589.26 599.90 A: and they may they maybe have to be checked by one but there could be two that are working together so i really think it should be randomly selecting two other 

590.65 592.18 B: they may yeah
