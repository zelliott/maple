0.72 2.23 A: hi i'm gail 

2.08 3.75 B: hi my name's anne 

3.69 4.95 A: hi anne 

4.65 6.05 B: hey what's going on 

5.59 9.17 A: oh [noise] i'm thinking about this issue 

9.22 10.40 A: um 

10.54 14.12 A: civil unrest in the middle east [laughter] 

12.92 14.91 B: yeah [laughter] 

14.47 20.32 A: well as far as i think they said do you think peace will ever be obtained and i'm going to have to say no just because 

20.54 22.29 A: the source of all 

22.35 25.54 A: [mn] the source of all of this and where it started 

26.19 36.29 A: [mn] um i'm not sure what your particular religious background is if you even want to share that but um being a christian myself and studying the bible 

31.54 32.46 B: mhm 

36.41 46.69 A: and knowing that this whole thing comes from the birthright of ishmael and isaac and the bible even says that those two will never have peace 

47.29 48.17 A: but 

48.74 53.31 A: i don't know if it's to the point where you know they need to keep blowing each other up 

53.75 59.19 A: and you know i mean the way that they're going about it do you remember when they used to just throw rocks 

58.95 63.08 B: [laughter] well sorry i i'm only twenty six so [laughter] 

62.00 64.89 A: i mean well that was only like three years ago 

64.53 65.96 B: yeah yeah 

64.92 77.92 A: you know it would be on the news and me and my husband would be laughing it's like look i mean you know israel would have weapons and you know these poor palestinians would only have like rocks well now it's like all of a sudden there you know they is like strapped 

78.50 83.81 A: you know bombs knives guns heavy machinery and i- i'm like man 

78.85 79.80 B: (( yes )) 

84.38 91.25 B: well what do you think about i mean what do you think about us being the only people who get to decide anything in the world do you think that's fair 

92.32 94.29 A: i think that um 

94.78 98.96 A: i know it seems like we stick our nose in a lot of things but i wonder 

99.55 102.01 A: and that's my other line which i'm not answering by the way 

101.97 105.08 B: yeah same here [noise] 

102.72 107.63 A: but um i really feel like if we pulled out of that situation 

107.97 114.22 A: in um less than a month's time israel will be annihilated they are so outnumbered 

114.41 120.26 B: you think because they i know they have a a lot stronger [noise] military than any of the other countries down there 

117.53 124.75 A: yeah they- they're stronger they're stronger but what makes them that much more stronger is that we back them up 

124.99 126.53 B: yeah that's very true 

125.91 129.51 A: you know and we keep the rest of 

129.54 133.27 A: the p- um muslim world arab world at bay 

133.43 142.05 A: you know it's like a localized but if we pull out man they got it all syria lebanon beirut they're all coming after them 

133.60 135.23 B: but do israel 

141.18 149.16 B: but should israel even be there i mean we created israel as a state we put people there who weren't there to begin with i mean 

148.02 155.33 A: and then you know like i said to me you know i know modern day politics says you know yes they should no they shouldn't 

155.37 160.72 A: but going back to what i study in the bible is they have the right to be there 

161.13 163.17 A: and i mean 

163.45 165.15 A: i can't argue with that 

165.03 170.45 B: well wha- what would you say if ah we said the native americans had the right to take back over all our lands here 

169.63 171.44 A: [noise] i would say they do 

171.94 173.20 A: (( ask me )) 

172.28 178.24 B: then we should just all move back to you know wherever we came from so we could let the native americans have america again 

175.41 176.58 A: um no 

177.35 181.16 A: but you know i mean it's not like moving back to where you came from 

181.27 186.92 A: but you know it it's a fact of um just recognizing that you know 

187.20 193.82 A: that you are in it's like you know let's say a group of us decided to go move to i don't know mexico 

193.77 195.38 B: yeah 

194.56 198.40 A: well we're in mexico now and that's not our native land 

198.26 209.70 A: but you know they need to recognize us as citizens and we need to recognize that we are in their territory [noise] you know and it's i'm sure it wouldn't take violence to settle that issue 

211.21 221.12 B: yeah i- it just seems really difficult when it all happened so long ago i mean if yeah the you know the people from israel were there a long time ago but there's such a big 

220.96 232.69 B: change in between so many generations so who says that those people really deserve you know to come and move other people off their land um it seems like that's where all the problems come from that the palestinians got 

223.12 224.31 A: mhm 

232.54 237.84 B: shoveled off to the ghettos and then ah israel became israel 

241.32 242.57 A: (( enough )) 

242.79 248.06 A: that's definitely the problem with the palestinians but an- and you know in a way i mean it 

248.11 260.45 A: looks like everybody just blames them for doing doing this doing this doing this but you know lately i've read in the paper like where [lipsmack] israel does stuff you know militarily and i'm like okay what was the point of that 

260.78 266.08 A: you know like i think the other day i read that they moved their tanks in on some um 

266.15 275.56 A: settlement over there ended up killing like fifteen people a couple young young kids and you know and and i never did see in the paper why they did it 

275.73 280.38 B: yeah it seems like they just can't stop fighting and 

279.36 281.93 A: and they don't want to i don't believe they want to 

282.46 292.34 B: yeah i i think the only hope there would be [noise] this is this is one of my little pet projects that um if we could just get them to sort of intermarry [laughter] then 

291.54 305.85 A: [laughter] you know you know that's just what i say you know everybody gets upset when they see biracial couples out i'm like yeah if everybody intermarries then what you gonna do you don't have any choice right [laughter] 

293.15 295.04 B: then everybody would be happy 

301.66 306.63 B: exactly [laughter] yeah both both families have to go with that [laughter] 

305.85 307.53 A: then they'll deal with it 

307.82 317.98 A: but you know [mn] just sometimes i tell my husband you know what i think we should just either surround the whole situation and back off let 'em duke it out winner take all 'cause i'm about sick of them 

318.20 319.60 A: (( [laughter] it's )) 

318.90 319.88 B: [laughter] 

319.74 330.19 A: like this is ridiculous i'm i'm i'm about sick of their fighting you know and i like i was telling some lady at church i say if women were in power none of this would happen 

329.94 332.05 B: you know i totally agree with that 

331.47 337.43 A: none of this would happen this is nothing but testosterone nothing but testosterone 

332.12 334.83 B: it does seem like that's where a lot of the problems come from 

337.86 338.75 B: [laughter] 

338.77 339.85 B: yeah [noise] 

338.93 340.14 A: [noise] you know 

340.09 343.92 B: [noise] seems like most wars have to do with that 

341.04 342.39 A: (( but my )) 

343.34 354.58 A: n- [mn] yeah i- um not both but all [laughter] you know no mine is bigger let me show you okay well we're over that you know i'm so over that by now 

347.57 349.21 B: (( [noise] yeah that's true )) 

354.66 358.65 B: yeah it makes me feel very dis- um disconnected from the government just 'cause 

359.12 367.28 B: i i can't understand why you would have to go to war all the time you know [noise] w- wh- why would we make why would we make ah decisions to 

367.43 374.99 B: you know have people i know or people my age go die for something i just don't even care about i mean 

374.25 387.37 A: mm i mean i understand that this man you know soon as somebody says something against him he imprisons them and but you know how about this how about we teach the people over there who want to to rise up against him 

387.86 393.50 A: you know instead of us doing it why don't we let the people handle it their selves those that want to do it 

391.99 392.98 B: yeah 

393.40 403.89 B: [mn] yeah and it seems i read somewhere that um [lipsmack] something like eighty five percent of americans now believe mistakenly but they believe that iraq had something to do with the world trade center 

404.16 407.00 B: which it just kind of shocked me 'cause 

407.30 416.35 B: i mean i'm not saying they're not bad people but a- but you know that wasn't them but everything thinks you know we're getting them back now for the world trade center well that's not the right people 

416.22 425.85 B: it wasn't saddam hussein those people they wouldn't even like sadda- the osama bin laden wouldn't like saddam hussein because saddam hussein doesn't believe in fundamentalist religious practice 

425.43 431.39 A: no yeah there's i mean two different um sects and i mean you know 

430.55 435.88 B: that would be like saying the the pope ah po- the pope is on the side of i don't know 

436.05 438.29 B: (( a pentecostal [laughter] you know just )) 

436.92 442.57 A: yeah [laughter] kind of not the same thing but yeah kind of not the same thing 

438.39 440.40 B: yeah they're both christians but 

442.73 450.31 A: i don't know this is is um tough to say but i know one thing about it i'm sick of everybody else hating us because of the middle east 

450.07 451.26 B: yeah 

450.53 451.53 A: you know 

451.79 454.07 A: i mean that gets old real fast too 

454.46 455.56 A: when you go over- 

454.66 455.81 B: where are you 

455.68 457.19 A: i'm in georgia 

456.97 458.73 B: oh me too i'm in atlanta 

458.52 460.23 A: oh okay i'm in snow mountain 

460.10 462.44 B: oh cool yeah i'm in right now 

460.47 461.91 A: up in snow mountain 

462.35 469.52 A: you know and i mean you it's like you read the news you hear the paper more anti american this more anti american that 

469.68 470.72 B: mhm 

470.86 480.23 A: and then you know sometimes i just think let's pull all our troops out of every country let us surround our border like you know keep people out of our country if you don't belong here deport 'em 

475.08 476.29 B: (( yeah and you know )) 

480.47 485.81 B: it seemed li- it seemed like everybody was on our side right after september eleventh and now everybody hates us again 

484.75 488.48 A: [noise] yeah and it's like okay so what 

488.70 494.63 A: you know we weren't we're not allowed to defend ourselves or you know i don't know 

496.09 501.17 A: [noise] i guess you know we were supposed to wait until something happened to us before we acted again 

503.03 515.40 A: [noise] but you know they i mean he seems they seem to think they have a strong case with what they just found for his developing weapons of mass destruction as far as chemicals 

514.44 516.32 B: oh i haven't read anything about that 

515.65 530.02 A: and biological [mn] and um it was a scientist i think who had actually buried evidence of the program and had actually given um a statement to the fact that when [noise] bush told him that he need to destroy his weapons 

517.13 518.09 B: mhm 

530.07 538.87 A: or you know get out of town that basically that speech he gave like forty eight hours before we went over there and that's when they actually did the destroying 

539.36 547.89 A: of much of the things so they set like one of the um factories or labs on fire and then they buried a lot of stuff 

548.62 552.38 B: yeah i did hear i've heard a pretty funny joke about um 

548.70 549.54 A: (( you know )) 

552.45 560.54 B: about bush doing that they said everybody makes fun of ah bush for being dumb but he ah got saddam hussein to disarm before he attacked him 

560.21 564.47 A: yeah [laughter] that is true 

561.01 562.33 B: [laughter] 

562.47 563.70 B: [laughter] 

564.34 567.69 B: like hey get rid of all your weapons now i'm going to invade your country 

567.04 571.77 A: no but now it's just a matter of it's not really going to be over until we find 'em 

571.63 573.78 B: i know it doesn't seem like it does it 

573.06 574.84 A: [noise] you know i mean 

573.84 575.67 B: kind of stretching out 

575.22 581.24 A: it's just september eleventh you real- you never can really stop looking over your shoulder until you find this man 

581.47 583.30 B: well we still never found him 

581.60 582.43 A: (( unti- )) 

583.11 585.24 A: yeah i mean and you know 

585.28 590.57 A: and until they do that you know you're never actually going to have the closure you need 

591.46 598.70 A: for that incident you know because he's always gonna be out there he's like that person who can always just sneak up on you any minute 

598.51 599.89 B: [noise] yeah that's true
