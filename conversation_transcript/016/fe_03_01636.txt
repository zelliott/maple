3.42 4.76 A: (( hi i'm ray )) 

4.76 5.89 B: hi 

7.22 13.60 B: okay so the topic of the day is what we think about the middle east 

14.06 17.13 A: yeah that's what i gathered from it um [noise] 

18.47 20.16 B: okay ah 

20.59 21.49 B: (( oh )) 

21.99 23.05 B: um 

23.19 24.58 B: personally i 

25.19 28.41 B: didn't agree with ah bush going to war 

29.00 29.87 B: (( ah )) 

30.44 43.41 B: they should have found the smoking gun i think first and then i don't think peace will be found in the middle east because they haven't found saddam dead or alive and he'll come back or somebody else will take his place 

44.53 45.38 B: (( ah )) 

46.25 47.36 A: yeah 

47.53 48.36 B: go on 

48.81 56.89 A: um i pretty much think that well [noise] we should go over there and [noise] stop them from whatever they're doing 'cause 

58.59 66.76 A: the way i see it saddam is a pretty dangerous guy and he's got stuff hidden somewhere and they've been doing it for like twelve years [noise] since the last war 

66.94 67.64 A: (( [noise] )) 

68.02 70.31 A: with them so ah 

72.79 77.10 B: yeah yeah he is dangerous but you know it's like 

77.56 87.78 B: like they say he had weapons of mass destruction and chemical weapons we have chemical weapons the united states has has chemical weapons 

87.76 96.38 B: you know and then they were talking about how he has these missiles long range firing missiles that he wasn't supposed to have well we have weapon power 

97.30 99.00 B: why can't they 

99.15 101.71 B: that's what i didn't understand about it 

99.58 100.41 A: well 

101.49 105.77 A: [noise] also the way um america's set up is 

106.79 116.38 A: our government's too chicken to use anything like that if we had to we probably would but only if we had to then they will just attack us for no apparent reason 

116.72 121.43 A: just they're pissed off at us because i don't know why but 

121.85 127.52 B: [noise] i think they're pissed off at us because we are butting our nose into their business 

129.54 130.92 B: that's what i 

129.81 130.90 A: yeah 

131.83 133.77 A: that's true too but [noise] 

137.38 142.65 A: [mn] ah also we're looking like ah from the last war when we just kind of left 

142.85 152.33 A: we're kind of looking pretty bad for that so i think ah [noise] bush was just wanting to you know make it seem like we were a strong country and we weren't just a bunch of chickens running scared 

153.56 156.96 B: yeah he wanted to take up where his dad left off 

156.55 158.69 A: [noise] yeah exactly 

158.65 159.82 B: yeah 

159.91 160.85 B: ah 

160.99 168.64 B: [mn] yeah i i think somebody will take saddam's place it's just a matter of time you know it's just a matter of time before 

168.58 178.37 B: osama strikes us again 'cause they haven't found him and if they find him somebody else will take his place there's never going to be peace as long as history has been 

176.01 176.86 A: no 

178.36 183.66 B: around since the beginning of time there's always been war there's always been dictators it's 

184.37 190.50 A: [noise] [noise] just like with world war one they stopped germany once they rose up and there was world war two 

191.22 192.30 A: ah 

191.26 192.32 B: yep 

192.51 194.59 B: exactly yeah 

194.11 195.05 A: i mean 

195.47 196.76 A: [noise] war is a 

197.21 201.39 A: war's pretty much just a simple solution that doesn't really solve anything 

201.15 202.35 B: yes 

202.56 205.57 B: i agree with you there it doesn't solve anything i- 

205.90 208.96 B: in some cases it makes matters worse 

209.16 210.38 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

210.24 211.47 B: yeah 

212.55 213.42 B: wh- 

214.31 215.19 B: (( ah )) 

215.57 220.75 B: what do you think of ah do you think s- somebody will come and take saddam's place again 

221.29 224.98 A: um [noise] i don't think he's dead i don't think he really needs to 

225.32 227.89 A: anyone's going to have to take his place ah 

228.43 229.49 A: (( h- him and )) 

229.54 232.98 A: osama bin laden are probably hanging out somewhere in the mountains 

233.32 235.51 A: and they're just 

233.45 234.48 B: (( you think )) 

234.80 238.23 B: [mn] you're think they're like partners in crime 

238.41 243.65 A: [noise] um not not necessarily like partners in crime but 

244.35 248.10 A: pretty much like ah they're both on the they're both 

249.07 251.25 A: they're both against america 

251.51 254.28 A: so it's just kind of like they're ah i don't know 

254.51 255.61 B: yeah i 

254.58 256.84 A: they're just kind of stuck together in that matter 

256.80 263.95 B: yeah they're both against america but i think that their egos are too big they want to have the satisfaction 

261.60 262.33 A: (( [noise] )) 

264.12 278.17 B: of bringing america down you know they want to have all that glory so i don't i don't think some people think you know that that they're conspiring together and working together and i don't think so i think 

266.15 270.63 A: (( [noise] )) 

278.05 283.36 B: each one wants to have the satisfaction have the glory of well we did america in 

283.99 285.80 B: now that's what i think 

285.22 286.07 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

286.48 290.42 A: you're probably right in that matter both of them probably do think that they're 

290.81 294.78 A: that they should be the ones who ah finish out their duties 

295.19 298.73 A: [noise] and they're going to try and see which one does it first 

295.58 296.41 B: yeah 

298.66 302.33 B: (( yup exactly yeah yup you )) 

303.14 309.81 B: know some people even thought that sa- ah that i talked to thought that saddam had something to do with nine eleven 

309.90 313.69 B: that he was in it with osama and i was li- i didn't think so at all 

315.77 317.08 A: (( [noise] )) 

317.49 323.12 A: [noise] um i'm sure they at least knew about what was [noise] going on between it [noise] 

323.19 326.41 A: at the very least i'm sure they did 'cause you know [noise] 

327.57 331.06 A: over there i'm sure stuff gets around just like it does here in america 

330.98 332.87 B: (( yeah i ah )) 

333.15 334.70 B: i'm s- yeah 

335.02 336.72 B: i'm sure it does too 

336.86 338.53 A: yeah [noise] and i mean 

338.96 346.55 A: there mi- there might have been just like a little bit of conspiring on it but it wasn't like saddam hussein was in the major thing of it 

346.72 347.52 A: i'm 

346.89 348.42 B: yeah 

348.92 355.33 A: he might have like contributed like ah i don't know some information or something that was probably about it [noise] 

354.66 355.81 B: yeah 

356.12 359.80 B: yeah he probably gave information but yeah 

364.06 366.21 B: do you think they'll find saddam 

366.66 367.61 A: no 

367.59 371.44 B: no i don't think so either just like they will never find osama 

371.67 372.90 B: yeah 

371.94 378.67 A: [noise] i mean even if they could produce some like like teeth that matched his dental record but [noise] they can't find anything 

379.15 381.80 B: yeah and that's a 

383.80 384.76 B: yeah 

384.04 389.46 A: [noise] like a- after nine eleven they were finding they found at least something of somebody [noise] 

389.91 396.39 A: you know to match up who was missing and everything like that but this i mean there was what like there couldn't have been [noise] 

390.13 391.52 B: yeah

416.12 418.92 B: yeah that's what i understand too 

422.97 429.42 B: yeah we'll have to see how it goes i i think there will be another dictator to take saddam's place 

424.88 425.78 A: [noise] 

429.61 431.23 A: yeah if not 

431.79 440.42 A: if not there somewhere else i mean there's gonna there's always gonna be another dictator right behind him just like we're having problems with what is it like korea i think

462.87 464.28 B: yeah 

464.80 472.74 A: [noise] see bush's problem is he's going to take on too many things at one time we're going to be fighting korea syria iraq and osama bin laden all in one swoop 

470.56 471.22 B: (( [laughter] )) 

472.03 477.37 B: [laughter] yup exactly he's biting off more than he can chew

495.87 496.54 A: (( [noise] )) 

497.29 502.61 A: i i think that they should've at least been behind us but other than that i don't see why anyone else would [noise] 

502.53 504.28 B: yeah yeah 

502.88 508.00 A: you know considering we kept them from being taken over in world war one and world war two

509.45 510.57 B: (( yup )) 

509.80 510.83 A: i figured

538.88 544.78 B: yup we have and it hasn't done us any good we don't benefit from it 

544.53 549.59 A: [noise] no there's only two wars we've really benefited from that was the civil war

552.80 553.98 B: yes 

554.09 564.72 B: yup i agree everything else and then like what happens now like with iraq now that saddam's gone for now we got to take over and rebuild their country

567.24 569.69 B: and that's what makes me mad i mean 

570.13 577.62 B: they're giving what iraq like seventy billion or something to rebuild their country when we need that money here 

578.06 579.71 B: no that's wrong
