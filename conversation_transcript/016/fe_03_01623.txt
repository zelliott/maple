4.69 8.25 A: all right well at least we got a good topic today 

8.06 9.96 B: [laughter] why what was it before 

9.61 10.96 A: (( ah )) 

11.14 14.91 A: ah strikes in professional sports 

13.89 17.16 B: (( oh yeah yeah hey where are you located )) 

16.69 18.84 A: i'm in boston mass and you 

17.78 24.12 B: okay so i'm in washington so let's see i'm trying to figure out if the marathon is over i've got a two oh eight 

24.24 25.49 B: pm 

25.18 27.20 A: i have no idea 

26.77 27.87 B: no okay 

27.80 29.83 A: i'm not a big marathon fan 

29.45 30.75 B: (( oh all right )) 

30.55 36.93 A: so the middle east now i don't know whether they're thinking iraq or israel or what 

37.43 40.42 A: um but i have opinions on all of it [laughter] 

39.66 46.81 B: [laughter] so let's see how does this work um they're going to record 

45.94 47.66 A: they're recording us right now 

47.65 48.70 B: um 

47.86 52.30 A: and we talk for ten minutes on these selected on the topic of the day 

51.94 52.89 B: okay 

53.34 54.76 B: you want to start 

54.17 56.06 A: sure um 

55.10 56.40 B: shoot 

56.19 60.27 A: so do you want to talk about iraq or or israel 

59.98 63.73 B: let's do iraq it's probably less controversial [laughter] 

61.38 62.39 A: okay 

63.23 65.53 A: yeah that's for sure 

65.68 67.38 A: well um 

67.58 71.83 A: ah my feeling on iraq is i feel that the 

71.85 72.77 A: (( ah )) 

72.82 75.80 A: i'm very cynical about our current administration 

76.59 86.30 A: um i think that they've done a big bayton switch on us i was almost at the point of supporting the war when they were talking about weapons of mass destruction 

86.32 94.40 A: but you know then they go in and you know they start talking about ah getting getting rid of the you know hussein 

94.53 95.46 A: (( ah )) 

95.96 103.04 A: reign of power and it's like wait a second we just had a bayton switch here what happened to weapons of mass destruction 

104.10 109.10 B: yeah i i hear you i don't feel so bad about that though um 

107.63 108.75 A: mhm 

109.31 115.73 B: it's almost to me a case of they probably know more than what they're saying 

115.67 124.45 B: um if there's any cynicism upon me it might be a little bit towards mr chaney i think at least down here in washington 

124.85 133.45 B: he's probably the least credible out of the gang of who's running things but you know i think um 

130.85 131.83 A: mhm 

134.24 143.45 B: you know i think they're sending a message over there and i think so far it's gone a hell of a lot better than i thought it was going to go in the first week 

143.43 148.87 A: that i have to agree um it it definitely has gone um 

149.37 156.15 B: you know i was looking at this thing as as you know it's easy to win a war it's very hard to win 

149.38 150.89 A: much faster 

156.36 170.64 B: a clash of cultures unless you just wipe somebody out and we certainly weren't going to do that and i thought it was going to be a complete cl- clash of cultures in the beginning but it doesn't seem to have gone to that and um 

159.53 160.92 A: mhm 

170.97 180.60 B: [lipsmack] maybe it won't i mean it's still a little early to tell but who knows where any of the leadership is and where they've gone and so we'll just have to see 

179.42 187.49 A: well it's still very early i mean we're s- we're talking about a culture that's got probably seven different um 

188.78 190.99 A: ethnicities at least 

191.05 195.80 A: each with their own values and their own agendas 

195.27 197.80 B: yeah but i mean in general 

197.99 209.15 B: my kind of u._s. centric view is that it's almost like everybody is sort of five hundred years in the past with a very possible minority of who who aren't and um 

209.82 210.94 B: (( ah )) 

212.41 219.75 B: that makes things very difficult you know people are living in with value systems and beliefs that 

219.83 225.48 B: the u._s. hasn't held to if not ever at least for a couple a couple of hundred years 

226.01 237.52 A: um well one i i agree with you it is a very u._s. centric view um you know an interesting thing for me is when the war started i was ah travelling from vietnam to cambodia 

238.07 244.14 A: so it was very interesting being in a country which was completely devastated by 

244.21 246.57 A: ah american forces 

246.58 251.34 A: um while listening to all this discussion about going to iraq 

251.37 253.26 A: and um 

254.91 256.50 A: you know it's 

258.03 261.77 A: the thing is is our way is not necessarily the right way 

261.83 265.36 A: and i think that it is arrogant to say 

265.43 271.01 A: this whole attitude of making the world safe for democracy which was the attitude they had in the vietnam era 

271.02 273.12 A: um it's it's crazy 

273.50 283.58 A: um you know in vietnam now there's a lot of changes it's it's a very positive up beat place right now and they're not um rallying for democracy at this point 

285.52 289.71 B: well i i haven't been there i've been to the middle east but ah 

289.83 297.97 B: my understanding of what's going on in south east asia is that it's going more towards economic democracy 

297.91 298.87 A: yes 

298.97 301.38 B: so in that sense 

301.76 305.10 B: maybe it is becoming more like the us i don't know if 

306.15 310.22 B: i don't know if that's benefiting everybody or just a small minority of people or what 

309.62 315.66 A: it's benefiting some um it hasn't really worked its way into the 

315.90 322.99 A: the ah hinterlands yet um although i think everybody in general is better off than they were twenty years ago 

323.04 324.04 A: um 

324.41 325.28 A: but 

325.42 334.52 A: the thing that i lear- i did a lot of reading on vietnam before i went and the the thing that i learned from that experience is that 

334.95 340.32 A: you know the attitude of the united states is oh they're so backward and you know we're 

340.95 347.95 A: you know how can we possibly lose to them and we had not a clue as to what their value systems were 

348.22 356.28 A: and um that they themselves were split about the direction that they wanted to go in 

356.34 364.69 A: and you know i hope that our administration is a little more sophisticated this time around in understanding 

364.67 368.56 A: ah these different folks and um 

368.53 381.71 A: [lipsmack] ah what they're wanting out of their government it's not going to work if we go in and say okay here's democracy modeled as it is in the united states um go ahead let's let's put in this place and this is what you guys are going to live by 

381.86 383.14 A: (( it's not going to work )) 

382.89 384.25 B: (( yeah maybe )) 

384.81 393.84 B: um i think probably the administration is certainly more savvy and and understanding of the world than it was thirty years ago when ah 

394.03 396.37 B: we went into vietnam but um 

397.00 403.73 B: [lipsmack] um like i say i think hopefully everything will turn out um 

403.81 411.07 B: will it have an effect on the rest of the middle east it might i mean it looks like maybe syria is starting to 

411.48 417.54 B: come over to our side and not be confrontational right now um 

418.03 420.84 B: maybe they're willing to work with us ah 

420.95 422.81 B: maybe this will 

423.05 424.15 B: um 

425.11 428.78 B: maybe it may disrupt some of the 

428.88 431.09 B: nontheologically 

431.98 438.73 B: um centered governments in the middle east and maybe that will be a good thing we'll see i don't know 

439.15 452.29 A: yeah well i i guess there's two parts will will the the area overall um improve probably there will probably be more stability that comes out of this because the united states is going to enforce stability 

452.29 461.85 A: and certainly the economic life in the united states is going to improve because we're going to have control of the oilfields in iraq at least for a short while 

462.08 463.08 A: um 

463.35 466.97 A: the question to me is whether the ends justified the means 

466.99 468.07 A: um 

468.26 472.68 A: should we have gone into this in the first place i'm not sure 

472.89 477.78 A: you know it's the only thing that that um 

478.21 478.77 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

478.83 482.68 A: would swing me at all was one of self protection 

483.15 489.88 A: which is there may be these weapons of mass destruction and th- we need to go in to deal with this 

490.32 499.09 A: but beyond that it's as as evil as saddam hussein is as soon as we walk in and say 

499.23 506.31 A: this is a bad government we're going to do something about it ah we're going to impose something else on you we're walking into trouble 

507.50 511.29 B: yeah um maybe if ah 

511.59 523.62 B: the ah regime is kicked out as it apparently is and then we let everybody else take over maybe they will sort of revert to a better system not necessarily ours or anybody else's ah 

524.03 528.32 B: you know you could always argue that ah all of their dissent has been 

528.62 537.72 B: ah squashed over the past eight years um and maybe they will [noise] form their own system that will benefit their people i don't know 

536.57 537.68 A: mhm 

538.08 546.39 B: they certainly have the resources to do it and to make life a hell of a lot better for all of their [noise] all of their people i mean they have the the 

546.65 551.07 B: you know they certainly have the oil they're what the third largest ah 

550.69 555.59 A: second yeah even better they're potentially the second largest oil producer 

551.50 552.41 B: second 

555.23 559.81 B: yeah so you know if the u._s. is smart and can 

560.09 567.74 B: get those fields producing without u._n. sanctions and get the money 

567.65 575.60 B: back in there quickly to refinance the rebuilding and to make it better for all of the citizens and um 

576.10 587.12 B: maybe it will come out okay you know i think one of the best things they could do would be the same thing that douglas mcarthur did in ah in occupied japan [noise] one one of the first things he did was 

587.14 589.83 B: give women the right to vote in japan 

588.89 590.14 A: mhm 

589.89 599.63 B: and if they do that most of the time women vote for things that they feel will improve their family and make the future better for their kids
