454.22 460.78 A: my daughter does ah my the older one she's in a she has a saxon book at her school too so they must be pretty popular 

460.35 465.35 B: well that's what i've heard and i i like the math um they don't really have a workbook per se 

465.02 466.12 A: mhm 

465.47 473.57 B: they kind of [noise] have to write and they do different things where and i and i- it's kind of nice in a way i mean she likes workbooks 

473.59 477.62 B: but at the same time i think some people can get too caught up in workbooks 

477.14 478.23 A: yeah 

477.63 479.79 B: this way the child has to write 

479.62 480.86 A: yeah 

480.27 486.07 B: and um think and um or they do a lot in the little grades they do a lot of um 

486.19 488.39 B: manipulatives and stuff [noise] that ah 

488.36 489.34 A: (( i see i )) 

489.29 490.62 B: keep 'em busy 

490.24 494.02 A: had thought about doing that but i don't think i have the patience i don't know 

494.12 494.81 A: (( [mn] )) 

494.21 497.33 B: yeah y- you'd be amazed i mean it's s- i think it's good 

497.25 499.75 A: i well i think it's a good idea i really do 

498.77 501.93 B: and i have more than i ever thought i'd have so 

500.87 502.28 A: do you just have one child 

502.01 509.03 B: yeah and i have more and she's a pistol she's everything she's me in spades and my husband in spades and it's like oh boy 

508.73 510.07 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

509.12 514.13 B: and i'm like i know if i had her in school they'd be saying mrs schmitt you need to put your daughter on ritalin 

513.99 516.48 A: oh they do that so much with kids 

515.70 529.71 B: that's my biggest that's my biggest reason my stepson um i'm convinced that that was unnecessary in his behalf where i don't i th- i don't think it's right where a teacher with a four year degree in education should be the one saying put your kid on ritalin 

522.36 523.40 A: mhm 

526.17 527.12 A: mhm 

529.31 530.43 A: yeah right 

530.07 540.98 B: and um they do that because they've got too many kids and they um they want 'em to be real quiet and ah she's i don't think she's hyperactive i think she's a normal full spirited kid 

540.62 541.72 A: yeah 

541.49 546.53 B: and i don't wanna discourage that and that's one [noise] thing with home school you can tailor it to them 

546.16 548.28 A: well that's true yeah 

547.13 553.35 B: and i've a- a lot of people say that about the patience but i i've found i have far more than i ever dreamed 

552.47 553.94 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

553.52 562.60 B: and um check out yahoo groups there's a whole bunch of home school lists i know there's a big one for florida because some of the florida ladies are on other groups i'm on
