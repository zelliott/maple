118.27 122.84 A: right i think that we're very um insensitive to 

123.27 131.51 A: the way other people do it i think we think that our way is the only way the best way the right way and we just can't really see how

265.37 265.93 A: (( [mn] )) 

266.94 268.01 A: (( uh-huh )) 

267.57 281.70 B: and he just declared himself mayor and they said they can't get him to leave the city hall [laughter] and he's there wh- they interviewed him and he said well we need the americans to get the water back on and the electricity back on and then they need then they should leave 

269.09 270.35 A: [laughter] 

271.97 273.40 A: [laughter]

287.89 288.95 A: yeah 

288.13 293.39 B: [mn] nothing [mn] i yo- you know i don't understand [laughter] any of it i really don't [mn] 

291.37 292.50 A: yeah 

292.90 294.03 A: i know 

294.39 296.99 A: yeah well i think 

297.06 303.41 A: ah gosh i don't [sigh] i don't know what to think about all of this i just 

303.08 317.93 B: no i wasn't real supportive at the beginning i kind of thought it was more about oil than anything else but then as the war went on you know and you saw these people that were you know pulling down the statues and all that stuff it was like well gosh you know they really are happy to see us 

308.12 309.21 A: mhm 

313.51 314.54 A: mhm 

317.34 324.00 A: yeah i i really that the majority of them are happy i mean obviously there's 

324.20 328.80 A: a good number that are not pleased at all with us being over there but i think that 

326.37 327.57 B: yeah 

328.84 335.31 A: most think that we're there we're trying to help them and they're supportive of it 

334.33 340.94 B: yeah i kinda think the people in the street you know they must be glad to be out from under that 

340.02 342.62 A: yeah i mean they've just been living 

342.68 347.19 A: under [mn] this horrible dictatorship for 

345.37 346.43 B: yeah 

347.38 350.84 A: for so long that i think they're just ready for i 

348.63 349.58 B: yeah 

350.95 359.13 A: mean even it e- even if they aren't able to do it themselves and have to have the u._s. come in and help them to 

358.33 361.70 B: right do you think we'll get stuck there 

362.02 363.96 A: [sigh] i don't 

364.00 366.21 A: i i think that this is all go- 

366.24 377.88 A: i thought that you know when they were first when everything first started um i thought it was going to take a very long time for all this to happen it seems to be i mean 

374.78 375.79 B: mhm 

378.12 380.28 A: obviously it's 

380.63 386.02 A: nowhere near over but i think that it seems like the um 

382.46 383.47 B: no 

386.04 389.09 A: actual combat is [mn] 

387.76 388.70 B: yeah 

389.30 403.53 A: not la- gonna last as long as i had thought it would um i mean obviously the conflict is not finished but i thought that they would there would be more fighting than it sounds likes there's going to be 'cause it just 

392.61 393.73 B: me too 

395.64 396.67 B: (( mhm )) 

401.77 406.03 B: yeah me too i thought they would put up a lot more resistance than they did 

404.88 405.86 A: mhm 

407.29 413.36 B: but i i d- i just wondering how long it's going to be before we actually can leave 

413.06 414.01 A: yeah

446.74 448.49 A: right under control 

447.85 454.98 B: yeah and you know that's [mn] i don't like the thought that we have to be any place in the world other than being helpful
