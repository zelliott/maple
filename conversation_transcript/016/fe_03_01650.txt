1.21 2.39 B: (( hello )) 

2.29 4.56 A: [mn] hi this is dianne 

4.44 5.80 B: hi i'm karen 

6.24 9.03 A: ah i'm from texas where are you from 

8.46 10.38 B: i'm in california 

10.28 18.75 A: okay um so we're supposed to talk about the middle east problem [mn] does that include like the war the that's going on 

15.11 16.25 B: yeah 

18.47 20.18 B: i would think so [noise] 

19.98 21.27 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

20.47 29.89 B: yeah [mn] i guess how we feel about they said something right before it connected about you know what we feel about it and if ther- if there'll ever be peace in the middle east 

29.90 32.72 B: so so um 

33.02 46.31 B: well i guess it's kind of easy to talk to somebody that you don't have to deal with on a day to day basis in case your opinions are different [laughter] well do you think we should be over there or we sho- i'm do you think the war should've happened 

38.52 39.79 A: yes 

40.35 42.65 A: [laughter] that's true 

46.70 47.73 A: (( ah )) 

48.22 61.58 A: yes i mean i guess as it got into it i was kind of for it i didn't realize like hussein was as bad as he was until we got there and i saw what he did to his people 

57.31 58.28 B: yeah 

61.38 62.49 B: oh yeah 

61.65 64.85 A: and i was like oh my gosh you know 

64.86 65.88 B: (( well )) 

65.00 66.65 A: i couldn't believe it 

66.16 77.32 B: yeah i think you know definitely we needed to be there and you know um it's kind of sad how things are going right now but i think they'll come around i think any society that's been 

77.45 85.52 B: suppressed for so long once they get this freedom i think it's kind of cool that they actually can protest because they never had that opportunity before 

85.37 86.56 A: yeah 

85.55 86.38 B: (( so )) 

86.53 95.86 B: so the looting kind of upset me a little bit but um i i could never understand that mentality and that even happens here in our own country so 

86.79 88.24 A: (( [cough] [mn] [noise] )) 

96.73 98.84 B: why people would ruin their own 

98.87 101.72 B: you know things or destroy their own city so 

101.82 108.90 A: yeah that's true that's true yeah [noise] i've been i've been following it pretty much like on the news um 

108.80 110.32 B: right i ac- 

109.54 115.82 A: fox news channel i'd [mn] especially in the beginning of it it was like i was really watching it you know 

115.74 116.63 B: yeah 

115.99 118.60 A: to see what was going on and um 

119.13 122.99 A: [mn] i'm surprised it went this fast too [laughter] 

122.41 136.95 B: that's true yes well i- that's good in a way you know glad to have it over there actually one of our neighbors they were on the news [mn] [lipsmack] because they have both a son and a daughter that are over there so they did some special interview thing there with them 

136.49 138.26 A: oh okay 

136.91 139.64 B: it was on the ah the local news channel here 

139.58 151.66 A: yeah [noise] yeah my husband was military ah i suppose if he hadn't of gotten out he would probably be over there so that gives me a little bit of mixed feelings there you know 

140.46 141.56 B: (( so [lipsmack] )) 

141.71 142.41 B: they 

151.06 157.96 B: yeah i- it it would be tough to have someone you care about over there knowing you know the chance that something could happen to 'em 

157.60 159.46 A: [noise] yeah that's true 

159.51 173.71 B: but i'm i'm glad that things have seemed to resolve pretty quick and hopefully you know i know what they say it's going to take a long time before things you know that their new government will form so [mn] i guess we're gonna still be over there for a bit 

159.86 160.66 A: but 

173.48 175.33 A: (( ah yeah yeah [noise] )) 

175.41 183.99 A: that's what i'm gathering too even though i think the guys that are there i think every six months switch off or something and just to kind of 

182.78 189.40 B: i think it yeah i think they probably will let them come home you know since it wa- it's not kind of active fighting any more 

189.15 190.21 A: right 

189.47 194.08 B: except for i suppose little pockets what do you think about syria you know 

194.01 195.88 A: oh oh 

194.73 205.08 B: i guess they're kind of coming around though too i read something online this morning that they are kind of coming around to you know being open for talks and stuff like that too 

204.22 207.82 A: [noise] well that's great because i i i really 

207.67 221.58 A: i don't want anymore you know i would rather nothing else you know go on but yeah i was i was ah when it ah brought up the thing about you know they found stuff from china and they found stuff 

209.74 210.86 B: i know 

221.41 226.84 A: ah from the french over there you know that they had sold to 'em or whatever 

226.05 227.56 B: oh i know and 

226.96 229.08 A: ah i was like ahh 

227.74 228.83 B: russia 

229.02 234.63 B: and russia also yeah it gives you one more reason to dislike the french huh [laughter] 

233.18 237.77 A: yeah well i thought i i i just couldn't believe it because 

237.81 247.15 A: well it worried me that worried me too 'cause i thought you know what are we going to do about that you know and it started kind of worrying me but i think 

247.03 253.35 A: you know all in all everything's kind of you know i think everybody's talking and 

253.86 262.77 A: [mn] which is good because like i say i don't want anymore and i would hate [mn] you know for anything like you said with syria you know 

254.18 255.78 B: yeah yeah 

259.92 260.74 B: yeah 

262.29 271.32 B: kind of a necessary evil that we have to be the ones but you know we are the most powerful country so [mn] what do you do you think saddam is dead or alive [laughter] 

271.92 273.56 B: what's your gut feeling 

272.29 273.31 A: i kin- 

273.31 282.89 A: i really kind think he's alive [laughter] [mn] i do i don't know why but ah i think he is i don't know but and i'm sure ah 

275.91 276.83 B: you do 

282.77 289.36 A: his people are going to think that unless they have like absolute proof where they could see him [mn] 

286.39 287.33 B: proof 

287.57 288.61 B: (( i know )) 

288.91 301.02 B: i don't know you know a a part of thinks he's not but part of me thinks he is but i guess you know i was talking with my husband about it and i the bottom line is whether he is dead or alive he is totally never going to be in control of that country again 

300.39 302.79 A: that's true that is true 

301.22 305.66 B: so i guess it really doesn't matter but it would be nice to know th- you know 

305.69 309.93 B: what his you know what if he is dead or alive you know 

309.56 312.10 A: yeah yeah 

310.33 320.26 B: if those if those bombs hit it was pretty wild to ah to see you know his places and you know the luxury he lived in while his people suffered 

320.09 321.56 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

320.27 323.86 B: that was just you know amazing that he could do that 

324.74 329.02 B: so i i it just that whole culture pretty much amazes me 

329.13 340.59 B: and how abo- how about the information or th- or should i say the disinformation minister [laughter] the guy who would always go on the news and say oh we're beating the americans you know 

329.21 330.33 A: yeah 

337.33 339.41 A: (( [mn] )) 

339.65 342.19 A: i know i know 

341.41 347.03 B: wasn't that funny it's like gosh like this guy is living in a dream world [laughter] 

347.40 348.72 A: yeah 

348.13 350.45 B: i can't remember what his name was um 

349.93 353.88 A: i can't either but i i could not believe he was 

353.89 359.89 A: going on there saying the things he was when we we knew we knew what was going on [laughter] 

358.65 366.68 B: i know see that's what i have felt about that culture a lot you know like you know even with the the guys who hijacked the planes um 

362.03 363.49 A: (( [noise] )) 

366.63 371.95 B: september eleventh you know how oh no th- they had nothing to do with it you know it's like th- [noise] 

371.78 383.76 B: they could be it's kind of like a sociopathic society you know they believe their own lies it's it's just kind of strange you know even when they're caught red handed doing something it's like they don't 

378.15 379.63 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

383.82 386.86 B: they still won't admit to it 

386.69 388.24 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

386.89 391.41 B: (( you know i mean that's what that information minister was doing you know he was just you know )) 

391.45 396.38 B: he's they lie i i don't understand it i i don't understand that culture so 

396.36 398.90 A: oh i don't either i don't 

398.39 401.40 B: and i guess i wo- i probably won't [laughter] 

399.06 399.87 A: (( [laughter] )) 

400.70 405.66 A: i know i i really can't i think you know [mn] 

406.47 420.85 A: and we were discussing i don't know this i- this is kind of funny too ah 'cause me and my husband were discussing like you know the french or ah now they're wanting to step in you know they want the what is it the u._n. or whatever to 

421.26 421.82 A: (( [mn] )) 

421.99 435.20 A: ah or whatever to step in now and take over to to see everything that it's all right [mn] my husband i guess just for laughs he was saying wouldn't it be something if we gave 

423.82 424.42 B: ah 

424.89 425.90 B: yeah 

435.67 436.82 A: um 

438.44 440.42 A: iraq to 

440.72 441.81 A: kuwait 

441.96 443.70 B: (( [laughter] )) 

442.75 453.59 A: gave it to them i mean they've been you know really good they're they're good people and i i i thought it was hilarious 'cause kuwait's so small it's so tiny 

446.51 447.43 B: yeah 

453.29 454.12 B: yeah 

453.46 462.10 A: [laughter] and if we said okay you know this is yours and [mn] you know just told 'em it was their country 

461.79 465.89 B: ah ah yeah i don't know if i don't think they could do that but you know 

465.28 467.69 A: i know i know [mn] 

466.97 478.51 B: i think the iraq people you know have their own right to you know control their own country there were just under you know saddam's rule for so long that you know [mn] so i don't think the most of the 

474.74 476.12 A: yeah 

478.42 486.94 B: iraqi people are bad people i think they were you know obviously either misinformed or you know just had a suppressed society so 

486.50 487.46 A: yeah 

487.15 490.80 B: so hopefully i guess you know time will tell to see how they 

490.86 495.85 B: how they can pull it all together but you know i think in general you know 

496.21 499.05 B: people are inherently good at least you hope so 

499.15 501.45 A: yeah yeah i do i 

501.99 511.50 A: [mn] i feel sorry for the women and kids i mean even on the you know when i'd watch the news whatever and and that was really sad and i noticed they're 

511.98 519.30 A: [mn] ah for a while there it seemed like when they would show stuff over there you didn't see any women and children 

519.10 520.00 B: well 

519.35 523.09 A: i mean it was only the men out in the street you know and 

521.69 529.90 B: well women have never been able to be out in the street you know that was shown in afghanistan yeah th- they're not they're not even pretty much allowed out in public 

526.59 528.04 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

529.89 530.76 A: mm 

530.59 540.06 B: if they're out in public they have to be completely cloaked in veils you know so [noise] but i think you know they they probably didn't feel safe being out there too [lipsmack] you know 

538.49 539.52 A: yeah 

540.23 544.34 B: i be- you know unless they were getting food for their families or you know 

543.49 544.06 A: (( [noise] )) 

544.48 547.22 B: i wouldn't be out there [laughter] if i was over there 

545.85 547.61 A: uh-uh me either 

547.27 548.47 B: no way 

547.66 549.75 A: (( me neither [laughter] [noise] )) 

548.84 551.48 B: men got that testosterone thing going so 

551.13 554.11 A: [mn] yeah yeah [mn] that's true 

552.89 558.54 B: but it seems like ten minutes is a long time when you are trying to make conversation huh 

558.16 560.67 A: yes it does 

559.08 560.07 B: [laughter] 

560.33 564.92 B: i didn't even look to see what time it was when we started but i know they signal you 

560.99 561.87 A: (( ah )) 

565.08 570.92 B: so [lipsmack] um let's see what else i don't want to go off the subject since they probably wouldn't 

565.17 566.05 A: yeah 

571.34 574.12 B: wouldn't like that i'm not even sure [mn] 

574.61 576.30 B: how much you have to be on 

576.32 577.12 B: oh my 

577.56 580.46 B: um my husband just walked in the room [laughter] 

579.74 581.67 A: [laughter] 

580.75 583.68 B: anyway i'm just talking the iraqi situation 

582.64 584.45 A: [noise] 

584.01 589.67 B: so um let's see what else could we talk about on it i think we've covered most of the 

589.34 590.76 A: yeah 

590.11 599.89 B: kind of a lot of bases there i haven't really checked what's on the news today about i just this morning read the headline that syria was open for um
