0.16 2.11 A: hi my name is charlotte 

1.72 3.51 B: h- hi i'm nakil 

3.63 4.83 A: hi how are you 

4.56 5.84 B: good thanks 

6.12 9.38 A: um i understand that the topic is the middle east 

9.03 11.37 B: that's right 

9.95 12.71 A: um are do you where do you live in the country 

12.51 14.33 B: i'm in columbus ohio 

14.00 18.57 A: okay that's where my fa- that's where my husband's from up in that area i live in florida 

17.99 19.41 B: i see 

18.81 23.25 A: um well i'm i'm kind of uh mixed on this issue a little bit um 

23.57 32.04 A: um i i didn't i don't know if i if i agree with the whole issue or not i think that some intervention was necessary to help the people there 

28.32 30.13 B: mhm 

31.67 34.24 B: (( mhm )) 

32.46 33.51 A: um 

33.59 36.01 A: what do you how do you feel about that part of it 

35.73 42.36 B: [mn] well uh how i feel about the whole issue is uh terribly sad obviously um there is uh 

40.75 42.05 A: yeah really 

42.42 44.84 B: no other way to react to it as uh 

45.44 58.14 B: new civilization that we are in america because the guys who are fighting there are obviously [sigh] ancient uh civilizations right so our local standards really on the matters are are you know 

53.04 54.66 A: yes very much 

58.14 65.59 B: is rather limited uh because we don't really think back as many centuries as they can 

66.08 72.59 B: but uh ironically that is seem to exacerbate the problem rather than go towards solving it 

72.53 79.02 A: yeah i s- i see that especially they were the especially when the looting and everything and the destruction of all the property 

72.95 74.12 B: (( but um )) 

76.96 77.81 B: mhm 

78.62 79.86 B: mhm 

79.23 80.89 A: um they were 

81.16 88.79 A: i hear- heard on the news they were talking about that this was just their way to unwind or to um you know they had been held repressed for so long 

88.87 92.87 A: but i'm really concerned especially for the antiquities that were destroyed or that were 

92.12 94.74 B: (( but are are you talking of iraq or uh the middle east )) 

94.29 95.42 A: (( well [mn] )) 

95.45 99.09 A: i was talking about iraq um a little bit um 

97.00 98.18 B: oh okay 

99.16 106.61 A: as far as the middle east are you talking about um say israel and wh- which anything in particular that you're referring to 

103.95 104.98 B: yeah 

106.64 114.26 B: yeah i was talking of uh [laughter] you know the fact that jerusalem is a holy city for these three really old religions right 

110.94 111.85 A: (( yeah )) 

113.83 114.82 A: yes 

114.50 127.27 B: i mean uh i think uh but that's something that's a fact that a lot of debates actually leave out uh the fact of the you know the oldness of these civilizations really i think they are [sigh] 

125.06 126.02 A: mhm 

127.25 140.67 B: uh the very fact that they are so old should be a a reason for them to be more wise in resolving these kinds of conflicts 'cause i would i would imagine a country like america for example if we were directly involved in a conflict like this 

134.39 135.39 A: right 

140.67 147.89 B: uh would tend to prolong for uh you know long because we don't have a a base really to operate from whereas these guys do 

147.74 148.62 A: right 

148.37 157.26 B: uh unless it's actually working against uh for each of them really on the ground so that's what i expect i i think that's a very important uh 

157.26 163.74 B: uh point in you know in diplomacy in that region really we have to consider that these people come from very 

163.83 167.05 B: uh deep rooted traditions of uh religious part 

166.69 167.65 A: yes 

167.91 170.06 A: i was married to a to a muslim 

169.85 170.92 B: (( oh really )) 

170.24 175.37 A: yes i was but when i was very young so i know i know a little bit about 

174.88 179.54 B: what do you mean when you very young [laughter] oh [laughter] okay 

176.54 183.10 A: well when i was in my twenties um when i was in my early twenties i was married to a muslim for a short time he was from libya 

183.34 184.43 B: i see 

183.56 193.11 A: so i so i do i do know about you know about the faith and everything and but i i think that um as far as we're talking about middle east and jerusalem and everything 

193.31 200.79 A: uh it's sort of uh a double edged sword because we have to sort of be there to protect but i i'm not sure if we're helping or if we're hurting it 

200.48 201.95 B: (( mhm [sigh] )) 

200.98 204.72 A: because i think we're interfering in something that maybe we shouldn't be interfering in 

204.86 206.90 A: maybe it has to run its course 

207.02 209.01 A: maybe it has to work its way out 

209.06 211.75 A: i don't really you know but 

211.88 216.22 A: the people that are there there's i mean there's innocents too that are involved in it but 

216.28 221.25 A: i don't believe that it's gonna stop i think it's just gonna go to its conclusion whatever that is 

221.34 225.65 A: and i don't think there's i don't think there's too much that's gonna change that 

226.15 236.06 B: that's right uh see personally a lot of people when i talk about um the middle east uh i mean i live in a university community so we have these kinds of discussions every now and then 

233.92 234.97 A: mhm 

236.21 248.16 B: and they say okay what's your opinion who do your sympathies lie with and uh [sigh] uh you know i [laughter] that's a hard question really because when both sides are dying you really can't sympathize with one at uh [laughter] you know 

247.43 248.35 A: right 

248.20 251.36 B: at uh you know the expense of the other really 

251.65 259.14 B: so but but uh i mean the real uh the first thing i answered to that question obviously that i sympathize with uh 

259.26 265.60 B: uh the occupied people obviously i mean isn't it i mean they have had that land and for 

260.91 261.85 A: yes 

261.97 262.93 A: right 

265.84 274.40 B: so many centuries before the um the present day israeli it's more than that and uh my c- my i always wonder why 

275.25 280.28 B: it could not be a question of immigration i mean why could not uh uh current day jews 

280.49 287.74 B: actually have immigrated and become citizens of say palestine or uh wherever but other than you know just as america for example 

284.00 284.94 A: mhm 

287.77 290.39 A: well there's a lot of people in america that wanna go back 

290.40 294.19 B: right well but the folks who came here are now americans right 

293.78 294.76 A: yes 

294.12 296.14 B: (( i mean they are jewish americans )) 

296.04 305.11 B: when why could not uh people who went there be uh jewish palestinians and uh have immi- uh apply for immigration i mean why could not immigration be a 

305.01 314.00 B: a policy that the united nations rather than uh allowing america to recognize israel and then perpetuating the invasion in um you know history 

313.39 316.40 A: right i agree i agree with that i think that's um 

314.46 322.35 B: uh i i think that could be a possible solution to uh you know this uh i mean it's never too late to go back to these 

322.53 323.52 B: um 

323.68 325.91 B: kind of you know possible solutions 

326.56 329.19 B: [laughter] really but i don't know what you would say about that 

329.17 338.43 A: well i i think i think that might be um that might be a good solution to try um certainly what's happened right now hasn't hasn't worked it's not working 

338.33 339.32 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

338.66 340.96 A: um and 

341.15 348.85 A: as far as i i i'm a i kind of i mean obviously i'm american citizen i've been born and raised here but i also think that 

348.92 353.99 A: that sometimes america tends to get too much into other people's and other countries' business 

354.03 355.28 B: mhm 

354.50 356.81 A: i r- really think they do um 

356.93 359.21 A: even as far as this thing with um 

359.33 371.74 A: you know with iraq um i i mean that's sort of a mixed subject with me too i know i knew that something was needed but i'm not sure that we de- that our president chose it for the right reason 

360.70 361.26 B: (( [sigh] )) 

372.05 381.21 A: at this time and i'm concerned i mean i have two children that live in the household with me and they're both teenagers my younger one is very disturbed about all this 

372.26 374.92 B: mhm 

381.17 382.22 B: i see 

381.57 386.40 A: she's very disturbed about about all the innocents that died she doesn't understand 

386.51 394.96 A: um even just things like car bombings or something like that she just doesn't she's like but they shouldn't do it anyway it doesn't matter 

395.28 406.27 A: and you know and i'm trying to explain to her you know and i can't and it's kinda hard for me to explain to her because i don't you know like i told her i said she goes well if you don't know then how am i supposed to know 

395.44 396.63 B: mhm 

399.69 401.79 B: mhm 

406.75 414.14 A: and i'm like you know you're that's that's entirely correct but i i'm not gonna tell you that i understand it if i don't i mean it's 

414.28 419.19 A: and i'm not and i told her i said a lot of that is political it's politically um done 

419.55 420.38 B: right 

419.60 421.12 A: and um 

421.78 424.44 A: you know what are you gonna do i mean they're 

424.68 425.91 A: everyone 

426.43 436.53 A: we're not in control of those things you know i told her i said you know we're not we can vote for who we wanna vote and we can do these things but as far as i i don't really think that um 

428.50 430.01 B: indeed 

436.40 440.21 B: w- w- what is your view of uh the perceived uh 

436.57 437.13 A: (( [sigh] )) 

440.51 448.91 B: economic uh power of the jewish community in america do you think they are really so powerful financially that they control these major policy decisions 

448.36 452.63 A: mm um to a point yeah in certain areas yes 

452.72 454.80 A: i i don't think um 

454.81 461.77 A: i don't think it's i think that they i think they're very smart business people okay and i don't really think that i don't think that 

458.77 459.72 B: mhm 

462.04 472.56 A: you know that they're that they're i mean like i said i live in a smaller town in a s- in a suburb in florida central florida so i'm not really into a b- they don't have a big jewish community here 

468.18 469.13 B: (( [noise] )) 

472.84 482.16 A: so i don't see a lot of a lot of the business a lot of it is probably more behind the scenes that i don't know about although i did work for a jewish gentlemen up until recently 

478.75 479.76 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

482.45 484.04 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

482.55 483.84 A: and 

483.90 491.46 A: my op- i mean my opinion of him is not very good because he doesn't i mean well he believes in making money at any cost 

487.16 488.50 B: (( [laughter] )) 

491.65 496.34 A: he doesn't care who he hurts to do it who he takes advantage of who he lies to 

493.53 494.89 B: (( [noise] [laughter] it's like )) 

496.28 497.20 B: uh-huh 

496.45 501.00 A: who he does out of money and i finally decided i couldn't work for him any more 

501.30 508.97 A: just because of that fact he's a multimillionaire b- and being a multimillionaire you'd think that he wouldn't even need to be involved 

503.13 504.06 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

509.11 514.92 A: you know anywhere in the business as far as being around it but he's not he can't stay away from it 

512.37 513.45 B: mhm 

515.05 517.02 B: mhm 

515.19 518.98 A: and it sort of drives everybody a little bit nuts 

518.58 520.01 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

519.09 522.23 A: yeah because he's just he doesn't have any m- he 

522.28 532.62 A: he has no morals as far as what what he will do in order to be successful in his business and he that was my first um real 

532.78 536.19 A: having any real experience with 

536.28 540.79 A: you know anyone that i really worked with that closely i mean like i said i've been 

540.83 542.44 A: i've been behind 

543.56 551.86 A: um you know i've been behind the scenes you know where i where i know that people have owned these businesses but i didn't have contact with them 

546.27 547.25 B: i see 

551.89 554.67 A: um but having contact i would you know i i i 

554.90 558.56 A: had a real bad you know real bad thing from him you know i didn't 

558.63 565.39 A: i didn't care for his business practices and uh not to say that that's all the jewish community it certainly isn't 

565.33 566.76 B: (( [noise] [noise] right right )) 

565.98 572.20 A: but it gave me a bad f- you know g- kinda gave me kind of a bad a bad image 

572.01 573.16 B: right 

572.50 586.12 A: you know so um [mn] i mean i think they're very industrious people i think if they came over here after you know being you know coming over after the w- you know after the war and everything and i think they've set their families up and i think i commend them for their hard work 

586.15 591.37 A: i think they work very hard in a lot of places but like i said i as far as me knowing 

586.44 587.24 B: right 

587.89 588.85 B: (( right mhm )) 

591.66 592.65 A: um 

592.81 594.07 A: what this 

594.56 599.89 A: you know what this would do as far as a large community i don't know what do you think about that how what do you
