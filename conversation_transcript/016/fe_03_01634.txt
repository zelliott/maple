41.81 43.89 B: [laughter] 

46.59 53.89 A: what do they mean by peace what do y- you know like i mean i guess we have to agree on a kind of a working definition of it or at least

62.39 64.31 B: you know honestly 

64.36 70.16 B: i don't think there ever will be peace so it's hard to define what it is [laughter] [sigh] you know 

69.76 72.86 A: you don't think there can ever be peace well all right let's 

72.35 73.70 B: [laughter] 

73.29 75.01 A: [laughter] if we ah 

74.70 84.10 B: [sigh] i mean if if if if peace being people disagreeing and ah taking action because they disagree 

84.31 85.58 B: then um 

85.93 88.38 B: i think there will always be disagreement [laughter] 

88.06 101.37 A: i- if that there'll always be disagreements between people how about i mean a- and you know what i mean but i- it's a difficult thing because i mean the question they ask i- is so open ended i mean i i 

88.71 89.73 B: (( [mn] well i agree )) 

89.77 91.92 B: (( that there's always go- [laughter] all right i think we can )) 

91.97 92.89 B: (( agree [laughter] )) 

101.53 102.42 A: you know 

102.87 105.70 A: i mean the world is not going to become a perfect place 

105.55 106.56 B: correct 

105.82 119.06 A: you know depending on an agreement you know that o- or you know some kind of peace treaty that's signed [mn] um but i- i- if i- i'd be interested you know maybe if we could start from the point of view of like 

119.99 129.89 A: will there you know no active wars meaning ah invasions ah you know of of other countries and and you know 

125.61 126.50 B: okay 

130.24 142.84 A: greatly diminish like all right for example i would not say that there's peace in the palestine israel now whether there's a war going on there or not you know there's there's fairly regular violence 

142.92 145.78 A: you know and people dying you know so ah 

143.81 144.79 B: right 

145.01 150.59 B: so i- if we can agree that peace means no violence how about [laughter] 

149.27 159.88 A: well yeah i mean no you know there's still going to be robberies and stuff like that yeah right okay all right yeah we're talking about like no yes all right there we go all right um well you know i mean i don't know i mean [mn] 

151.92 154.28 B: oh [mn] right i meant ah 

154.53 155.78 B: terrorism 

158.26 158.88 B: (( [laughter] )) 

160.47 164.14 A: i think as long as people are 

164.35 165.63 A: taught 

166.44 170.57 A: that you know it's acceptable 

171.19 172.65 A: to kill [noise] 

173.10 177.91 A: you know because you're ah because you feel you have a grievance 

178.09 182.34 A: um then i think you know i think you're right i think that that that 

182.58 187.36 A: the- there's a strain of thought and it's not just in the middle east um but it's 

187.28 198.72 A: i- it's very strong there and it's it's active in other parts of the world that you know when you disagree with someone when you feel like you've been treated shabbily by them 

199.08 203.22 A: i- it's okay to kill their you know women and children um 

204.06 212.08 A: you know then we're going to have a hard time and ah i i don't know if that situation's going to improve that being said [mn] um 

212.30 224.07 A: i think democracy ah certainly we don't get along you know we don't all get along here in this country but or in democracies in general 

224.40 225.96 A: but there's 

226.85 228.85 A: there's more of a 

230.64 235.58 A: [mn] there's a less of a a willingness to go to violence 

235.76 236.77 A: um 

237.43 246.47 A: in order to work out those disagreements um clearly it's been done but maybe you've heard this that like there's no ah 

246.75 248.64 A: there's no recorded 

248.68 253.52 A: instance of ah democracies going to war with each other 

254.26 263.89 A: i don't know if that's absolutely accurate but that's the theory and it's it's interesting to think about 'cause it's it's at least on the surface true [mn] 

265.27 267.51 A: um and then i think that's the 

266.02 266.98 B: [laughter] 

267.61 271.28 A: that's the you know the biggest hope for the for us in the middle east 

271.02 273.62 B: [laughter] oh i- i'm 

274.18 277.87 B: i'm not sure how to comment on that um 

278.70 281.75 A: just let it ride let it ride 

279.01 279.88 B: you know 

279.92 286.59 B: [laughter] no no i'm i'm thinking do i go into ah [sigh] 

286.72 287.48 B: (( ah )) 

287.49 293.03 B: historical inaccuracies in this statement such as w- we're not a democracy 

293.13 298.24 B: we're a a republic because we vote for representative government 

298.03 299.94 A: okay fair enough 

298.72 301.68 B: and and secondly you could say that 

301.76 303.31 B: hitler was 

303.78 312.62 B: elected so you know it isn't like it was the same type system that we have now so [laughter] 

305.49 306.77 A: (( ah he was )) 

308.38 309.58 A: well 

309.89 316.96 A: no no true enough but hitler was elected hitler was elected but at the time that he launched his invasion 

313.28 314.38 B: (( r. right )) 

317.26 325.25 A: it was not a democr- ah it was not a representative government i- it was an autocracy or a you know a oligarchy or whatever they call 

321.00 322.83 B: right 

324.27 327.20 B: and um well i guess in my household 

327.11 333.80 B: i could stay that about the united states right now [laughter] since our rights are being taken away constantly 

333.66 346.27 B: and um you know because of um [sigh] the government says because of people are afraid i'm not afraid of anything [sigh] i mean i don't really think someone's going to ah 

346.22 358.69 B: have a bomb um in their purse at a baseball game and so you know i mean i'm just using that as an example you know and so when when these you know when i get searched um 

349.11 350.61 A: it [lipsmack] well i'm mo- 

351.48 355.88 A: well i agree with you on that i think i think a lot of these things are crazy 

359.77 361.41 B: i think my rights have been 

361.92 362.82 B: (( um )) 

363.79 370.47 B: voided and have been voided without an electoral process um you know more by 

370.75 377.33 B: (( our dictator in power right now but anyhow let's back to the middle east [laughter] )) 

374.57 378.46 A: let's get back to it let's get back to it well i- if l- let me 

378.35 392.75 A: just is that i agree with you on the issue of you know that certain of these rights are being done but the problem is you know there's no dictator in power that wa- you know there were elections these are elected we don't like the decisions that our government does but the fact is 

392.44 394.59 B: right um i i 

392.62 399.91 A: you know in [noise] in two years or f- one year you can elect someone else and yeah
