3.06 4.27 B: i'm cynthia 

3.97 4.96 A: (( how are you )) 

4.57 6.11 B: good how are you doing 

5.76 6.85 A: (( i'm okay )) 

6.62 7.48 B: good 

8.14 9.93 B: i'm ah calling from new york 

9.88 12.01 A: oh okay i'm calling from philadelphia [laughter] 

11.42 15.48 B: okay [laughter] so the middle east 

14.94 15.98 A: mhm 

16.19 18.89 A: um do you want to start mhm 

19.16 22.08 B: um [sigh] i can start um 

22.43 26.64 B: i have very uneasy feelings on the middle east i i 

26.65 36.71 B: very much doubt that peace is i mean that a that a kind of constant a continual state of peace and stability can be created at least in my lifetime or in the foreseeable future there 

36.97 40.24 B: um i lived in the middle east for a little while 

39.79 41.05 A: oh really 

40.25 41.14 B: so 

41.21 42.69 B: i guess i have 

42.79 46.38 B: i think when i was living there got more and more 

46.52 49.13 B: ah sceptical [laughter] 

49.07 53.46 A: um what capacity were you there in did you do you have family there or 

53.16 61.07 B: ah i don't have well i actually do have a little bit of extended family but no i was studying there um and i was actually studying the palestinian israeli conflict 

57.32 58.16 A: (( mm )) 

61.21 62.48 A: (( mm wow )) 

61.52 63.22 B: so um 

63.52 70.90 B: (( that meant that i ended up you know spending a lot [noise] of time thinking about the conflict [laughter] yeah so )) 

68.49 70.88 A: yeah i can imagine hm 

72.44 76.94 A: yeah well personally i mean i would have to agree like 

73.32 73.96 B: (( um )) 

76.97 89.46 A: i just know it's it's been going on since basically you know the beginning of israel and even before that you know it's it's an ideological conflict so those are typically the ones that are not easily resolved right [laughter] 

88.96 96.60 B: yeah i mean i think it's it's ideological and there's also a physical piece of land that's very small [laughter] you know mhm 

94.33 102.55 A: right i mean it's it's true and i just don't feel like i mean because it's someth- it's a matter of um it's like you know it deals with people's 

102.39 113.95 A: beliefs about what's theirs and what was divinely given to them i i just don't see how a [noise] compromise could ever be made if someone feels as though the entire land belongs to them and they won't be satisfied with just you know a part of it 

114.34 121.02 B: well i also think there were historical mistakes made i mean i think there was an opportunity in forty eight for um 

121.16 132.27 B: for peace i mean there were proposals you know for a binational state and and there was some support for that but i think i'm i'm more on the israeli side but on both sides there was also this feeling of like 

122.19 123.61 A: (( oh definitely [noise] )) 

133.37 141.16 B: not there wasn't enough support behind those kinds of plans because everybody thought they could win you know [laughter] get the whole thing and ah 

139.07 140.04 A: yeah 

140.17 141.10 A: right 

141.28 156.17 B: and now i think you know the realization has been okay you know no one is winning and no one predictably is going to win i mean you have the two largest demographics you know you have the rise of ultra orthodox judaism and then you have 

156.18 158.90 B: palestinian increase and so you have the two 

159.48 162.23 B: gr- predictably muslim palestinians you know are 

161.45 162.03 A: (( yeah )) 

162.29 165.31 B: demographically increasing so you have these two extreme 

165.52 178.16 B: sides that are going to get more and more demographically so i think that in the next you know twenty years certainly we'll see it get a lot worse before there might be you know the potential for it to get better but 

175.33 176.18 A: yeah 

178.28 182.86 A: i mean i just feel like how can you reason with one faction of the people who feels as though 

183.10 194.01 A: israel has never actually existed like how can you say okay well israel will get this land and you get this land it's you know if they're just like well we just our whole the whole idea of israel is an anathema to our 

194.02 195.97 A: belief system you know it 

196.25 200.56 A: just seems to me like you know you can't compromise on people's beliefs 

200.28 205.09 B: well and palestinian state hu- likewise is is kind of a 

205.17 206.23 B: um 

207.90 214.05 B: an an a complete contradiction to what what most israelis feel is their right i mean um 

213.31 218.34 A: but they're so willing to compromise i feel like israel has given back so much land you know 

218.32 228.62 B: but there are there are you know several points on which neither side is willing to compromise um and i think that no matter what you know those points are going to be the ones that are 

223.23 224.41 A: that's true 

228.68 240.40 B: that are the deciding i mean we have jerusalem number one neither side was willing to compromise on jerusalem you know you have the ah return of palestinian refugees neither side is willing to compromise on that one 

233.20 234.46 A: mhm 

239.92 240.74 A: (( mm )) 

240.45 244.39 B: you know i'm trying to think what the third one there are three big ones do you know what the third one 

244.30 248.16 A: um wasn't it well not the gaza strip um 

244.41 244.98 B: (( is )) 

248.41 250.73 A: let's see well i know they gave back sinai 

250.73 254.63 B: right now now there's a third there's a third point on which 

254.78 268.86 B: up to this point it was the three that when when oslo went through their the whole problem [laughter] with oslo was it was like okay you know we're going to do this whole deal land for peace we're going to give back a little bit of land and you're going to get a little bit of peace and so back and forth and back and forth 

268.85 270.05 B: and then 

270.13 281.53 B: into oslo was written that these three issues that basically no one wanted to deal with oh i know what it is it is the settlers of course the um jewish settlers in palestinian territory 

281.21 282.14 A: oh 

281.54 282.56 B: um 

282.58 288.91 B: and those three issues pr- were written in oslo that they wouldn't be dealt with until later 

288.92 300.44 B: [laughter] because no one wanted to deal with them but the problem is that those are the issues [laughter] the ones that no one can agree on and that's why in the end oslo fell apart because um 

290.14 290.75 A: (( mhm )) 

294.28 295.48 A: (( exactly )) 

300.43 309.69 B: you couldn't there got to a point where you had to deal with those issues and they were becoming so problematic that you were having more and more unrest and that and then it was over you know 

303.94 304.71 A: (( mhm )) 

309.84 310.74 B: so 

310.85 315.68 B: i don't know i mean they're talking more about peace talks but i think it's going to be interesting to see how 

316.10 317.22 B: um 

317.26 321.01 B: iraq and what's going on there plays in 

321.20 322.77 A: yeah definitely 

321.21 322.11 B: (( you know )) 

322.65 325.98 B: um because that's that's a big unknown i mean 

326.06 328.51 B: it's not it's not that it's necessarily 

328.70 330.13 B: it's just it's 

330.20 341.86 B: a close enough part of the region that whatever happens there will affect the situation and i think globally people seem to think of them being very int- maybe even more intertwined than they really are um 

333.85 334.63 A: mhm 

342.43 343.85 B: but 

344.70 350.04 A: yeah i just i just find it so hard to tell like the arab leaders you know they'll say one thing at the um 

350.02 361.76 A: at the diplomacy table and then turn around and you know just to save face in front of their people so they don't you know get assassinated they'll authorize ten more suicide bombings or i don't know yeah it's just so hard to 

356.30 357.10 B: right 

362.17 364.88 A: to really take what people say at face value 

364.57 374.82 B: mhm well i think with the suicide bombings though you have a situation where it really doesn't matter what the leadership says because all it takes is one person strapping some stuff to them 

374.55 377.26 A: and there are fanatics on both sides i mean i think that 

374.93 376.37 B: [laughter] 

377.20 390.31 A: i mean most people you know whose ideology isn't that strong are like they won't compromise people who live there don't want to you know live you know um fearing for their lives every single day you know but it's just the fanatics who 

386.83 387.72 B: (( right right )) 

390.43 392.72 A: who are just blinded to all reason 

392.32 398.26 B: i mean on both sides most people by far want to just live their lives in peace 

397.42 408.35 A: i mean of course and i i mean i'm definitely biased towards israel that i i have to say you know they're they're i mean israel is not blameless either i look at you know rabin got assassinated by one of his own people you know 

407.41 409.89 B: absolutely and there had been i mean 

410.36 420.66 B: you know is- israel for whatever it's done is also a product of britain's decisions you know and i think that if i look historically at what 

417.21 418.04 A: mhm 

421.24 435.54 B: who's really to blame in my mind it's more britain than anybody else because britain basically post world war two is like oops we're totally you know we're in recovery we just really can't deal with this situation and we don't have the the troops or the money to put into it 

435.40 443.81 B: so we're just going to sort of let it go its own way now and [laughter] you had wars and you had the creation of israel um and i think that you know [noise] britain 

439.65 440.37 A: (( right mm )) 

443.84 449.01 B: by taking on all its all its colonialist um 

449.00 459.28 B: [noise] actions it became basically irresponsible at that point it was too involved to make that kind of decision and when they made that kind of decision they basically screwed it up for everyone else because 

459.33 471.64 B: they didn't deal responsibly with the situation they had created and now the whole world is dealing with the results of that you know i think i mean it's interesting because when i um was living there i went with a group 

465.84 466.91 A: right 

471.75 479.71 B: of people i we were almost all had some jewish heritage and i h- i'm half half jewish and um 

479.96 483.46 B: and and i would say coming in we're almost all 

483.80 487.89 B: slightly more tending towards more pro israeli just because 

486.79 487.64 A: right 

488.03 492.97 B: we that was our background and people had grown up with varying degrees of you know 

493.01 493.94 B: um 

493.88 494.88 A: (( involvement right )) 

494.22 496.91 B: involvement young zionists and etcetera etcetera 

497.08 501.29 B: um and i think without exception we left pro palestinian 

501.38 508.92 B: which you know it's just it's it's just one group of people um but i think that there is something that is 

509.22 515.98 B: really hard about actually living there and seeing the reality that yes it's true 

515.99 525.42 B: you know buses blow up but for the vast majority of palestinians their their standard of living is so far below the israeli standard of living 

525.17 526.45 A: yeah 

525.86 529.51 B: that it's really hard after a while um 

530.02 531.33 B: to 

531.27 545.93 B: to sympathize overly with the majority of israelis who are living and of course there are there are definitely segments of israeli society that are quite poor but um on the whole israeli living conditions are so much better 

545.87 550.08 A: i mean and i i definitely agree with you but i mean this is probably 

546.07 546.88 B: um 

549.94 558.84 A: i just maybe i haven't done my research but i just feel as though i mean israel is surrounded by all of these arab states you know israel is such a small piece of land and 

552.80 553.86 B: [laughter] 

556.40 557.34 B: (( right )) 

558.62 564.77 A: i feel as though the palestinians are the majority of them are arab you know and they they share the same ideologies as 

564.54 578.38 A: the surrounding arab countries so it's not as though they don't have any place to go i mean if it is a choice between their life or their homeland then i mean i would just think that you know they would be more willing to run to accepting neighbors rather than stay and fight and lose 

567.57 568.32 B: (( mm )) 

571.60 572.33 B: (( mm )) 

576.93 591.46 B: but see this is the interesting thing because in fact and it's that's exactly what a lot of israeli education says honestly i mean that's exact in line look you know we're a small country we're surrounded by this arab which is true certainly i mean geographically 

589.81 590.66 A: (( mm )) 

591.38 599.89 B: but in fact the palestinian people that have gone to surrounding countries have been treated basically you could say it's a form of racism and
