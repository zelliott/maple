26.65 27.28 A: um 

27.49 29.81 A: i don't know any other countries that i would be fearful of

30.76 32.14 A: that i'm scared of now 

34.08 35.40 A: terrorism in general 

35.82 36.91 B: yeah but they have been 

37.01 38.72 B: kind of making a lot of noise so 

39.34 40.31 A: yeah i mean 

40.94 41.33 A: (( )) 

42.13 43.99 A: uh i don't know technology wise i guess 

44.78 45.59 A: china but 

46.27 52.87 A: japan or china but i don't i don't have any fear because uh i i believe in the relationship that we have with them 

53.68 55.74 B: yeah those are like (( )) 

56.45 58.07 B: i don't think they (( )) 

58.16 62.05 A: yeah i mean i can't think of another country that that we might be in a 

62.32 63.22 B: yeah (( but )) 

63.33 71.11 B: (( )) forget china or they won't try anything 

71.61 73.21 B: (( right )) 

71.80 73.77 A: that i don't know what they could be building 

73.88 74.34 A: you know 

73.93 75.04 B: yeah that's true but 

75.24 79.68 B: (( )) right yeah 

75.31 78.86 A: that you know w- i don't know what they are telling the public and what they can do 

80.22 81.50 B: but i guess uh 

82.79 83.77 B: most of the business 

84.02 84.64 B: being done 

84.80 85.91 B: in this country (( by )) 

86.19 90.48 B: is by china so most of the products that are being sold eh 

90.76 91.55 B: chinese products 

91.65 93.86 B: so i don't think they'll try to do anything 

94.63 95.69 A: that's true 

95.61 95.89 B: but 

96.00 97.62 B: so i guess uh 

98.79 100.86 B: uh iraq is the main 

101.30 105.72 A: yeah th- the one that i'm i'm scared of cause we have an idea of what they're capable of doing 

101.34 105.64 B: yeah 

105.76 108.15 B: right and they're not going to just sit and 

109.32 110.72 B: take it i mean that's the problem 

111.55 112.29 A: (( )) 

111.80 112.97 B: they're going to fight back 

113.12 115.57 B: (( so )) 

113.40 113.94 A: i mean you can 

114.02 115.59 A: you can always go back until 

115.78 118.02 A: like russia or soviet union but 

118.45 122.54 B: (( )) yeah 

118.97 121.21 A: i don't know if they have the economical you know 

121.52 123.59 A: where for all to uh be able to do something like 

124.10 125.78 A: that would threaten the united states 

126.13 129.37 B: right and i guess it's not in their interest at present uh 

129.50 130.12 B: (( )) 

130.26 137.52 A: yeah true i don'- i wouldn't think present wise but when growing up uh my only pla- only per- you know country i was thinking of was russia and soviet union 

137.70 138.43 B: yeah 

138.78 149.64 B: i guess uh i come from a different country so we were in fact real friends and where i come from india so we were like uh 

142.07 142.74 A: mm 

147.10 148.24 A: oh 

149.81 151.71 B: i guess u._s. was the enemy 

152.02 153.75 B: because it was uh supporting 

155.07 158.32 B: our enemy so uh it was like more of uh 

156.09 156.80 A: yeah 

159.09 163.68 B: oh it was more uh wh- what should i say it was more of ah becau- 

163.86 165.56 B: u._s. was not supporting india 

165.96 167.88 B: and uh soviet union was 

168.74 170.73 B: so we were like more with the soviet union 

171.18 173.03 B: but now i guess things have changed 

173.17 173.60 B: uh 

174.76 178.12 B: india is i guess more closer to u._s. than soviet union 

179.37 182.79 B: (( )) times now i don't think 

183.00 186.50 B: soviet union is really a threat so
