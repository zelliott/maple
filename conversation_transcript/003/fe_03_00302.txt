42.82 45.14 A: but anybody who wants to do anything bad will start sending 

45.95 49.47 A: old women or whatever and (( so when they're )) targeting certain people it's not working 

50.52 52.22 A: uh they did some publications on it recently 

52.95 53.36 A: (( )) 

53.00 54.60 B: but don't you think like the random 

55.20 55.73 B: um 

57.22 60.85 B: the random selectivity of of of the searches 

61.13 62.08 B: effective or 

61.15 61.59 A: yeah 

62.19 63.06 B: interesting or 

63.10 66.95 A: that's the only they were going to catch people effectively with the completely randomized searches 

68.31 68.79 A: um 

69.14 74.30 A: the other thing being that if they are looking for looking for scissors and nail files they are going to miss the really important stuff 

76.06 76.74 B: (( maybe )) um 

78.32 81.46 B: there might be better ways of of catching terrorists 

81.82 83.12 B: better than searching 

83.52 84.08 B: um 

85.62 88.33 B: bags and making people take their shoes off and um 

89.04 90.30 B: stuff like uh 

90.54 91.91 B: checking uh how 

92.26 95.22 B: people bought their ticket whether it was a one way ticket or whether it was 

95.39 95.70 B: paid 

95.79 97.20 B: for with cash 

97.11 97.78 A: yeah i 

97.47 97.95 B: um 

99.09 100.37 A: i agree (( )) 

99.84 100.36 B: like that 

100.64 103.27 A: i think the (( cash thing )) makes a lot of sense (( than the other )) one way tickets 

103.36 104.44 A: just sort of keeping an eye on it 

104.94 106.03 A: but i worry about 

106.41 110.71 A: all of the intrusive things that they are trying to do in the name of protecting us from terrorists 

111.53 113.35 B: what do you mean by intrusive things 

113.52 115.10 A: um as far as the 

115.58 116.43 A: trying to 

116.53 120.34 A: put all of the office of homeland security for one all of the 

119.58 120.41 B: yeah that's yeah 

120.92 122.15 A: um keeping 

122.89 124.97 A: all the tracks of (( email )) hm 

123.13 124.32 B: (( so the added bureaucracy )) bureaucracy 

125.51 126.93 B: sort of the added bureaucracy 

127.40 133.43 A: yeah i don't i also even if it is effective first of all it is a loss of privacy issue but there is so much 

134.21 137.97 A: room for error and (( so much slowness much )) slowness because of the bureaucracy 

139.16 139.51 A: that 

139.96 141.37 A: and nothing is going to happen on time 

142.05 142.51 B: yeah 

143.18 144.30 B: i'm um um 

144.85 145.73 B: as a person of 

145.88 147.45 B: color and as a 

147.92 148.55 B: uh 

148.81 150.61 B: brown person you could say 

150.87 151.28 B: i uh 

151.41 152.54 B: i haven't um 

153.87 160.12 B: these issues don't really concern me too much what actually concerns me is being targeted 

160.30 161.09 B: in the sense of 

161.10 161.48 A: oh 

161.36 162.17 B: profiling 

162.53 162.87 A: yeah 

162.67 163.12 B: um 

163.71 166.55 B: and so every time i fly it's it's it's it's 

166.99 168.57 B: it's it's always um 

169.45 171.61 B: it's always in the forefront in my 

171.92 174.11 B: in my head as to if i am going to be 

172.65 173.11 A: (( )) 

174.59 176.76 B: picked out and um how much 

177.10 178.13 B: of it actually 

178.44 179.71 B: is actually a 

180.08 182.91 B: case of it being a random search or if if it's 

183.17 184.50 B: something else um 

184.81 186.05 A: have you had any problems yet 

186.53 188.42 B: i did as soon as (( )) 

188.86 191.88 B: you know i flew a couple weeks after september eleventh and 

192.23 193.00 B: and um 

193.61 196.07 B: i flew into san jose california which is where i'm from and 

196.38 197.11 B: and um 

198.27 198.83 B: there were 

199.85 204.26 B: it wasn't problems it was just you know like a general sense of i'm being 

204.53 205.94 B: stared at or i'm being 

205.48 205.86 A: uh-huh 

206.32 206.90 B: um 

207.13 207.44 B: not 

207.66 209.38 B: not by security people but by 

209.66 210.78 B: people on the plane 

211.01 211.35 A: huh 

211.25 213.02 B: (( )) which is um 

214.04 216.25 B: which is kind of weird and spooky and scary 

216.35 217.28 A: yeah i can imagine 

216.95 217.26 B: um 

217.61 218.10 B: yeah 

219.60 222.34 B: but um the security thing doesn't bother me actually 

222.92 223.43 B: um 

224.32 225.36 B: it actually makes me 

227.07 228.03 B: you know to tell you the truth 

228.31 228.74 B: i would 

228.96 232.13 B: i wouldn't think that a terrorists would strike 

232.63 234.47 B: on an airplane or in an airport 

234.85 235.48 B: given that 

235.57 236.03 A: (( again )) 

235.96 236.39 B: (( how )) much 

236.66 240.93 B: yeah given that so much damage was done on september eleventh (( )) 

241.04 243.44 B: and because there is so much security at airports now 

243.87 245.79 B: it would seem kind of silly to me 

246.37 246.96 B: but um 

248.40 249.64 B: i don't know what do you think about that 

250.52 251.04 A: yeah (( i'm )) 

251.19 253.70 A: not sure about it (( )) there is just so many different ways to 

254.12 256.73 A: of really damage (( an )) infrastructure and i don't think that 

257.30 263.01 A: even given what has happened before and the supposed improvements that have taken place since i'm not sure that 

263.38 265.10 A: there would be any better response 

265.48 267.01 A: time and it would still be 

268.63 269.16 A: very 

269.42 272.57 A: damaging and i think it it might almost be a good idea because it would be 

273.42 273.93 A: almost 

274.82 275.52 A: uh 

276.51 277.35 A: embarrassing 

277.49 277.94 A: to 

277.77 278.18 B: right 

278.03 279.97 A: the administration that has tried to 

280.58 285.72 A: put all of these changes in place to prevent it from ever happening again or to make quick response possible 

284.05 284.41 B: right 

286.35 288.48 B: i do think that the federalizing of the 

288.72 289.56 B: security 

289.94 290.74 B: thing um 

291.47 293.60 B: um has made a difference because i flew 

294.06 295.54 B: the day after 

296.00 297.59 B: they were supposed to um 

298.18 302.52 B: the day after all the airports were supposed to um have a federalized security 

302.99 303.76 B: service and 

304.02 307.25 B: things did move a lot quicker and i f- i felt like 

307.80 311.41 B: it was more um of a military style security 

311.77 313.79 B: check than than previously but 

311.82 312.16 A: huh 

313.92 316.48 B: i don't know how long it will last given that um 

317.36 321.14 B: like almost every other aspect of the federal government is pretty 

321.54 323.02 B: um slow and 

323.51 324.35 A: (( )) very slow 

323.65 324.13 B: (( )) 

324.76 325.89 B: yeah like the d._m._v. 

326.07 326.45 B: (( )) 

327.38 328.71 B: oh i guess that's state government but 

329.37 330.56 B: (( )) the same thing for me 

332.11 332.56 A: yeah 

332.98 335.77 A: i guess i am just worried about the changes that are taking place as far as 

336.33 337.92 A: uh reducing the amount of 

338.73 340.23 A: uh privacy that we have 

340.83 341.76 A: and the r- 

340.92 341.34 B: yeah 

342.09 343.46 A: right to say things that 

343.96 345.97 A: about how we disagree with the government or 

347.08 347.84 A: how 

348.93 350.68 A: things could be different i just worry about 

350.79 351.92 A: (( that a lot )) of these things 

352.36 354.08 A: will end up influencing 

354.83 357.04 A: people in general and the government and 

359.46 359.84 B: yeah 

359.63 361.51 A: (( just people be )) afraid to speak out against 

360.23 360.54 B: yeah 

361.79 363.00 B: yeah (( )) 

363.60 364.97 B: i was talking to my dad about 

365.28 365.63 B: this 

366.11 366.85 B: issue and he's 

367.32 369.34 B: he's actually quite comfortable with the state of 

370.00 370.40 B: um 

371.02 374.25 B: um how science is going to contribute to the war on terror 

374.70 375.24 B: um 

376.23 376.62 B: (( he and i )) 

377.31 378.63 B: tend to disagree but he's 

379.24 380.97 B: um excited at the fact that 

381.93 383.18 B: technologies will be 

383.56 384.02 B: um 

384.20 385.73 B: implemented in airports to 

386.63 386.90 B: to 

387.75 388.50 B: to prevent 

388.61 391.07 B: uh terrorists from getting on board airplanes 

391.49 391.91 B: um 

393.05 394.35 B: i don't know what do you think about that 

395.65 397.07 A: so it seems like most of the 

397.30 400.65 A: things that they already knew about the people was that they were already on these various 

401.05 403.31 A: watch lists and that there were already warrants out for them 

403.59 403.97 A: and 

404.59 408.84 A: the fact that not even the i._n._s. caught them when they were renewing green cards and 

409.29 410.74 A: when they were acting 

411.13 415.18 A: sketchy when they were signing up for flight classes and things like that something to m- 

415.87 417.38 A: about that to me says that 

417.70 419.50 A: people weren't paying enough attention 

420.27 424.38 A: to things that were very obvious and adding more steps is not necessarily the answer 

424.75 425.22 B: yeah 

424.81 427.68 A: so much as making the other things work the way they are supposed to 

429.20 432.22 A: because i don't know if you remember but i think uh atta 

432.75 434.01 A: mohammed atta i think he was 

434.71 435.17 A: his 

435.40 437.75 A: uh visa was reissued 

438.51 440.65 A: some six weeks after he died 

440.48 441.23 B: right right 

441.08 442.19 A: (( )) that's 

441.53 441.93 B: right 

442.89 444.42 A: that's not appropriate 

444.75 445.17 B: yeah 

445.08 446.09 A: and (( i'm )) 

446.65 447.80 A: think that if they had 

448.29 451.21 A: could just make the things that they are doing already more efficient 

452.77 453.69 A: they wouldn't have to do it with 

454.31 455.60 A: scaring everybody else 

456.92 459.72 B: do you think people are actually scared or or 

460.00 460.87 B: more comfortable 

460.05 460.33 A: i 

460.93 461.40 A: (( o._k. )) 

461.04 461.61 B: i- i mean 

461.66 462.25 A: yeah (( )) 

461.83 462.88 B: or more secure 

463.41 463.87 A: i think 

464.66 466.50 A: there is a false sense of security 

466.74 467.16 B: yeah 

467.35 468.12 A: and 

468.45 469.64 A: it also seems that they are u- 

470.57 471.54 A: they (( )) 

471.71 472.07 A: you know 

472.28 477.57 A: the media society people in general are using it in terms of a scapegoat to blame away all the other problems 

478.76 479.52 A: that are going on 

479.77 480.19 B: yeah 

480.44 481.31 B: yeah it's (( )) 

481.03 482.52 A: and that worries me 

482.54 484.48 B: it's it's pretty funny how um 

485.12 486.78 B: the detroit media um 

488.25 494.07 B: everything is related to terror in some way on on the news it's it's it's pretty funny um 

494.76 497.02 B: it's actually scary not because 

497.87 499.85 B: it's actually scary but it's scary because 

501.05 502.61 B: people are so um 

503.42 503.87 B: (( )) 

504.08 506.02 B: their opinions are so malleable and 

506.35 506.98 B: and they 

507.21 508.76 B: they've changed this based on 

509.11 509.48 A: yeah 

509.77 510.45 B: bad media 

512.61 512.89 A: and 

512.67 514.42 B: but i don't know i'm going to be flying 

515.43 516.74 B: in a couple of days so 

516.90 517.36 B: um 

517.99 518.82 B: i'll see how it 

519.14 519.69 B: is 

521.19 522.11 B: how the security is 

522.31 523.09 B: (( )) 

523.33 523.75 B: safer 

524.27 524.63 A: yeah 

526.49 526.78 A: i 

527.66 529.88 A: i guess it doesn't really effect me so much when i go to the airport 

530.34 531.16 A: but i just 

531.60 531.87 A: don't 

532.83 533.85 A: see it making a big difference 

533.97 534.28 A: for 

534.59 535.45 A: things in the long run 

536.74 537.23 B: yeah 

537.66 539.86 B: i don't yeah i don't know how long it's going to last 

539.86 544.90 A: what really impresses me is the people who still go onto airplanes and do silly things 

540.39 540.73 B: this is 

545.21 546.58 B: with like guns and stuff 

546.75 548.69 A: yeah there was a guy recently that 

549.03 553.70 A: went crazy and attacked some the cockpit door i think it was actually on an (( )) flight 

554.09 554.57 B: yeah 

554.20 554.60 A: and 

555.23 557.76 A: they just beat him to the ground and that was it
