51.11 51.61 B: mhm 

51.81 52.48 B: (( )) 

51.93 52.86 A: (( )) 

53.07 54.66 A: (( )) go ahead go ahead 

55.15 56.58 B: no i agree i mean i think 

57.40 58.09 B: hopefully 

58.95 59.77 B: (( )) 

60.18 60.76 B: um 

61.45 63.27 B: you know make it much more difficult to 

64.00 64.54 B: bring 

64.82 67.19 B: bombs and guns onto the planes so it should help 

68.12 68.92 B: it probably won't 

70.00 71.03 B: stop the problem 

72.33 74.22 A: no no but um 

74.61 77.25 A: i mean i do know that um 

77.39 81.66 A: um (( )) the uh israeli airlines 

81.16 81.64 B: mhm 

81.84 83.87 A: has had much um 

83.98 87.75 A: you know much higher security standards for a very long time 

87.87 91.03 A: and they've never really had any terrorist incidents so 

90.95 93.40 B: well that's interesting so it should help 

92.34 92.77 A: (( )) 

93.69 95.85 B: so that would be great but are they do- 

96.63 97.86 B: is what we are going to do 

97.96 99.04 B: um 

99.45 101.90 B: is it going to be at the same sort of 

102.42 103.76 B: level as what (( )) 

103.92 105.29 B: the israeli 

105.79 106.53 B: airlines 

106.65 107.12 B: do 

107.68 111.63 A: yeah i don't think we could do it at that level first of all it's a um 

111.77 116.99 A: it's a smaller country and so there is you know uh (( )) 

113.69 115.21 B: right very small 

117.14 119.72 A: there is only a few airports and less planes 

120.30 123.71 A: and the kind of um they do um 

124.23 125.96 A: they do one on one uh 

126.32 130.11 A: uh searching of people i mean they kind of profile people 

130.23 135.21 A: and uh they uh question people at great length and they go through people's 

135.86 136.98 A: luggage 

137.12 140.63 A: and i don't think we could do that kind of you know 

138.70 139.30 B: no 

139.88 142.15 B: no yeah probably not 

141.03 141.87 A: i mean i- 

142.32 143.60 A: i mean it was just (( )) 

142.39 143.21 B: (( )) 

143.88 145.01 B: it would be chaos 

144.16 146.09 A: it would just be impossible yeah 

145.56 146.07 B: yeah 

146.51 146.96 B: (( )) 

147.85 149.07 B: well um 

149.60 151.58 B: yeah well we are in agreement i think 

151.87 152.37 B: so it 

152.55 153.29 B: hopefully it will 

153.72 154.67 B: it will help a lot 

155.68 157.62 B: have you had any bad experiences 

157.76 158.39 B: uh like 

158.74 159.33 B: flying 

159.96 163.58 A: you know i really haven't flown for the past um 

164.09 173.36 A: year and a half so since september eleventh i really haven't flown and you know it's not because i i've been afraid or anything i just i just haven't 

173.50 174.75 A: but in um 

174.87 177.56 A: in a couple weeks i'm i'm flying uh 

178.29 180.73 A: from oakland to cleveland so 

181.37 185.42 A: i guess i'll experience what the people have been talking about increased security so 

185.21 185.84 B: right 

186.02 187.48 A: which i think is a good idea 

187.59 189.65 B: yeah no definitely it's a good idea 

190.23 190.76 B: um 

191.21 192.24 B: yeah at i- 

192.43 192.70 B: i- 

192.92 196.42 B: i'm trying to i flew a little bit over the summer i i went from syracuse to 

196.81 198.21 B: portland oregon 

198.36 199.14 B: and um 

199.70 203.54 B: it was pretty easy but they are both very very small airports 

204.37 208.03 B: but i they did they did do a kind of a cool thing and um 

208.44 209.12 B: i can't remember 

209.26 210.07 B: (( )) 

210.45 211.81 B: laid over in detroit 

213.12 213.92 B: and um 

214.72 215.37 B: they uh 

215.65 217.08 B: they took my laptop 

218.06 220.24 B: and they they kind of dusted it and 

220.47 221.17 B: and they 

221.40 221.80 B: kind of 

221.98 227.34 B: vacuumed it it was very strange i don't know what they w- they must have been looking for some bomb residue or something 

227.55 228.18 B: um 

228.60 229.12 B: so 

229.28 229.74 B: they we- 

229.43 232.01 A: (( )) and how did you feel about that 

232.40 232.97 B: sum 

233.69 236.91 B: (( )) uh you know i i kind of found it interesting 

237.40 243.54 B: um they were doing it to everybody so it wasn't like i felt singled out or anything but they did pull people out of the line 

244.33 249.17 B: when i was in you know lining up to board the plane they would pull people out 

249.34 253.52 B: randomly and just search them um make them 

253.36 253.77 A: mhm 

253.72 255.10 B: empty their pockets and stuff 

255.72 256.31 B: um i 

256.41 256.96 B: you know 

257.48 258.50 B: it it was no 

258.66 259.02 B: was 

259.39 259.89 B: (( )) 

260.42 265.29 B: it wasn't bad or anything what they were doing it was it and i think it made everybody feel safer 

265.90 267.70 B: so although you know i don't know how 

268.25 270.58 B: they still have stories about people um 

273.08 274.85 B: you know getting through with stuff 

275.11 275.81 B: um 

276.41 277.65 B: that they missed or whatever 

277.94 278.49 B: and and 

278.04 278.68 A: yeah 

278.72 283.79 B: there is a a story circulating where and i don't know if this is true or not where somebody 

284.31 287.99 B: got stopped because of the books he was carrying 

288.10 289.14 B: so um 

289.39 291.64 A: because of the books he was carrying (( )) 

290.39 294.05 B: yeah he was carrying two uh one was um 

295.18 296.85 B: uh (( edward abbey's )) 

298.03 302.05 B: one of (( edward abbey's )) books he he wrote a lot about kind of (( eco- )) 

302.44 304.60 B: um ecology and s- and 

305.90 307.29 B: and um 

308.11 309.17 B: so he was 

310.06 310.70 B: um 

311.47 311.95 B: stopped 

312.16 316.91 B: i think you know it had some reference to bombs in the book and he was stopped and 

317.22 317.62 B: um 

317.79 320.53 B: they wouldn't let him on the plane at all 

320.71 321.09 B: so 

322.05 323.57 B: i thought that was kind of silly 

324.75 325.90 A: yeah yeah 

326.11 326.70 A: um 

327.72 329.54 A: i mean i don't know how i feel about 

329.67 333.15 A: the whole issue of profiling people i mean i don't know 

333.81 335.29 A: i think it's been um 

333.86 334.22 B: yeah 

336.74 343.34 A: uh sometimes it's done uh in a not very intelligent way in a very stupid kind of way and 

343.48 343.78 A: (( so )) 

344.68 345.15 B: yeah 

345.33 345.97 B: yeah i think that 

345.68 346.06 A: but 

347.38 347.94 A: um 

349.18 352.17 A: anyway so i think we are in agreement 

351.89 357.34 B: i haven't done one of these calls before what do we say now 

356.51 358.58 A: i don't know do you want to talk about something else 

358.42 359.95 B: sure sure 

360.14 363.62 B: we could take the ball into our own hands um 

362.69 364.62 A: how long are we supposed to talk 

364.56 366.12 B: i think ten minutes i- 

366.00 367.32 A: ten minutes o._k. 

366.68 368.43 B: yeah so i don't know i haven't 

368.53 369.69 B: is this your first call 

370.15 372.65 A: yeah this is my first call so (( i )) (( )) 

371.51 371.96 B: yeah 

372.92 374.21 A: not really um 

376.24 382.54 A: yeah uh well actually i i i do have one comment one comment about about um 

383.47 387.06 A: um i mean i just think it was outrageous that um 

388.02 391.51 A: the whole september eleventh was basically c- caused by um 

391.86 393.24 A: total lack of uh 

393.45 395.36 A: total lack of security 

395.97 400.02 A: i mean not only the airports but you know the intelligence services 

398.43 399.24 B: right like 

400.33 400.64 B: yeah 

400.59 404.55 A: and i mean basically the kind of intelligence you need is 

404.90 407.76 A: human intelligence where you know what people are doing and you have 

407.89 410.06 A: people in place who could you know that 

410.45 411.95 A: figure out things and 

411.56 412.56 B: that's right to put 

412.76 413.90 B: the pieces together 

414.41 415.04 A: yeah 

415.81 417.35 A: and um 

418.63 423.52 A: but i think generally if if i was i mean when i do go flying and i see that 

423.66 424.71 A: security is 

424.83 425.29 A: um 

426.47 433.94 A: you know stringent actually that will make me feel better i mean i don't think i will i don't think i'll resent it even if there would be 

434.74 436.75 A: some delays or something i don't know so 

436.98 438.19 B: no no 

438.84 442.16 B: (( )) i mean all you really want to be is safe so that's 

442.33 442.74 B: i i- 

443.79 448.10 B: i mean the first time i flew right after i mean it was a while after it wasn't right after it 

448.27 450.76 B: it was scary it was really scary 

450.96 453.95 B: and so you felt much better if they had people 

454.46 455.77 B: you know walking around 

455.98 456.66 A: yeah 

456.41 456.81 B: (( )) 

457.33 457.82 A: yeah 

457.64 459.18 B: security or whatever 

459.45 459.96 A: yeah 

459.89 462.36 B: nobody seemed to mind taking off their shoes or 

462.67 463.21 B: whatever 

464.22 464.77 B: so 

464.57 465.89 A: taking off their shoes 

465.93 469.49 B: yeah they made they made people take well it was after that guy 

469.90 470.34 B: i d-

473.55 477.30 B: (( )) made people take off their shoes and 

477.42 481.56 B: so you just kind of hoped that your socks didn't have holes in them so 

480.65 487.20 A: (( )) when i go to the airport i'll make sure i have good socks 

485.14 488.48 B: that's right matching socks and no holes
