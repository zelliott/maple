49.76 50.19 B: fair enough

53.64 53.96 B: uh 

56.32 59.38 B: what if it was uh under a legal system which you didn't believe in 

60.89 62.05 B: or it was uh 

63.45 65.11 B: (( )) (( set of laws that you thought were )) 

65.43 66.33 B: unjust or 

68.36 69.66 B: ill thought out when they were 

74.69 75.13 B: (( )) 

76.20 76.58 B: cuba 

78.11 78.49 B: (( trading with )) 

79.53 81.11 B: would you perjure yourself 

83.77 84.86 A: (( )) 

86.77 87.88 A: i guess i am going by a 

88.46 89.97 A: definition of um 

90.73 92.83 A: perjury out of the dictionary 

92.99 93.57 A: uh 

94.24 99.95 A: if i believed in the cause i wouldn't necessarily believe it to be perjury as far as being honest 

100.47 101.21 A: to myself 

101.55 101.95 B: okay 

102.38 105.63 A: it's like what is the definition of perjury 

105.27 105.70 B: right 

105.81 106.19 B: right 

106.90 107.35 B: yes 

107.72 109.41 B: i don't know what does the dictionary say 

109.81 111.89 A: (( )) 

112.36 114.22 B: okay (( )) 

114.33 115.91 B: i have a copy of i have a dictionary around 

119.20 121.73 B: uh but i am not answering the question i think that i 

121.22 126.42 A: no your not you are posing more questions that are not necessarily part of the 

122.00 124.49 B: i i uh i think 

124.77 125.07 B: i 

125.59 127.49 B: i i think i would i would probably 

127.69 128.00 B: uh 

129.30 130.95 B: i don't think i would commit perjury 

131.51 131.94 B: uh 

132.80 133.09 B: i think 

133.39 134.94 B: i would like to think that i wouldn't 

135.09 135.89 B: perjury because 

136.19 136.46 B: (( )) 

136.68 137.82 B: out of a sense of honesty 

138.15 139.45 B: but i have to admit that i also 

139.72 140.84 B: would not commit perjury 

141.15 141.61 B: out of 

141.87 142.20 B: uh 

143.90 144.33 B: fear of 

145.58 146.78 B: getting caught a very real 

146.88 147.70 B: fear of getting caught 

148.61 151.68 A: so that would be it's not based on a moral ground it's based on a 

152.25 153.47 B: oh i th- i think i think 

153.14 153.79 A: punishment 

153.90 155.32 B: i think it's based on both of them 

155.71 156.12 B: uh 

156.39 159.18 A: well i mean i just i don't think we should be 

157.14 157.52 B: i think 

159.45 161.70 A: placed in the position of committing 

161.84 165.23 A: perjury the act (( of )) or an act of (( solemnly )) 

165.62 167.08 A: (( solemnly )) 

167.17 170.67 A: affirming the truth of a statement that (( )) be false 

170.88 171.25 B: mhm 

171.33 181.64 A: or willfully giving false evidence or testimony while under an oath which one does not intend to keep the violation of a promised vow or solemn undertaking a breach of oath 

181.88 183.03 A: so what is perjury 

183.88 186.69 A: i mean you know would you (( coma- )) commit perjury 

187.05 189.11 A: if it was to um 

189.44 192.81 A: (( )) i mean as i understood the question would you commit perjury to 

193.45 195.67 A: if a family member was involved 

196.04 197.05 B: sure to cover their 

197.66 198.29 B: backside 

199.74 200.87 A: (( whether )) it is like the act 

201.39 206.67 A: action or an act of solemnly affirming the truth of a statement that (( )) to be false 

207.31 207.71 A: (( )) 

208.33 210.82 A: you know if i believed that my family member was 

211.46 212.49 A: um acting 

213.36 214.26 A: consciously 

215.55 217.15 A: i would not commit perjury 

217.69 220.20 B: so how about if your if your family member was 

220.99 221.64 B: smoking dope 

221.84 225.14 B: and you happen to live in a jurisdiction in which it was not okay to do that 

225.49 226.54 A: well that would be (( just )) 

227.13 229.87 A: continental united states 

229.23 233.50 B: for example although presumably there are some jurisdictions where it is okay to smoke a (( )) 

234.04 235.30 B: you have a medical condition 

235.83 237.09 A: right such (( oregon )) 

237.19 237.55 A: or 

237.59 238.52 B: such as oregon 

237.70 239.60 A: i don't know what california's laws are 

239.59 242.72 B: let's say that for example there was no medical condition (( which your )) 

244.50 245.44 B: and for some reason 

244.91 249.38 A: and if i was asked by law enforcement if a family member of mine was smoking marijuana 

249.45 251.64 B: yeah and you were in a position where you had to answer 

252.12 253.88 A: i would i wouldn't i would 

254.74 258.54 A: in that instance i would perjure myself because i don't believe in 

258.78 269.64 A: the extreme punishment because of the scheduling of drugs in the united states that somebody could go to jail for a lesser sentence for using cocaine than they could for marijuana 

269.87 270.16 B: right 

270.27 270.52 B: right 

271.01 272.16 A: but if 

272.26 274.38 A: i mean we are ta- it's all about degrees 

274.50 276.01 A: you know smoking 

276.23 277.61 A: t- marijuana 

277.75 278.99 A: is to me 

279.52 280.64 A: that is no more 

281.25 283.02 A: harmful than using alcohol 

283.56 283.82 B: right 

283.96 285.11 A: you know it's just 

284.02 284.36 B: right 

285.92 286.97 A: when you are getting into 

287.39 288.52 A: the politics of it 

289.01 289.27 B: sure 

290.33 290.79 A: um 

291.26 293.02 A: well then it becomes a different issue 

293.38 293.76 B: sure 

294.36 296.15 A: but if i say had 

296.52 298.40 A: a family member that was acting 

300.40 301.48 A: in a manner 

301.77 303.44 A: that i knew to be harmful 

304.00 310.26 A: to a certain group of people say i had a family member that was acting harmfully to 

310.45 313.38 A: target or marginalize a group of people 

313.87 314.21 B: sure 

313.89 316.27 A: and that they were actively placing 

316.38 317.13 A: laws 

318.71 324.43 A: passing laws and putting laws into effect that would guarantee that these people would be somehow 

325.25 325.74 A: um 

326.49 328.84 A: their li- the quality of life would be effected 

329.16 329.54 B: sure 

329.41 332.06 A: i would not support my family member in that action 

332.64 333.44 B: sure (( )) 

332.96 335.95 A: and i wouldn't perjure myself for some such a gross 

336.19 337.05 A: uh 

337.58 339.67 A: just gross injustice 

340.14 341.63 B: (( )) (( just because they were your family )) 

350.25 350.59 B: sure 

358.97 363.26 A: uh you know what germany was doing for years 

363.43 364.96 A: so you know 

364.39 365.03 B: absolutely 

365.64 374.39 A: consequently thousands of people were killed so if i knew hitler was doing that and you know the united nations came along and said oh well your brother is killing thousands and you know he's he 

374.59 376.92 A: has these concentration camps and he is 

377.06 377.72 A: gassing 

377.94 379.89 A: jewish people and i would be like 

380.05 380.40 A: or 

380.83 383.66 A: i would not protect that person in that situation 

384.03 384.37 B: mhm 

384.25 384.57 A: but 

385.24 386.67 A: so i would say you know 

387.14 388.28 A: um honestly and 

389.14 389.87 A: there would be 

390.11 394.70 A: situations where i may perjure myself depending on whether or not i agreed with the law like you had initially presented 

395.12 395.72 A: and yourself 

396.99 397.33 B: uh 

397.44 399.76 B: yeah uh i mean i think that if i was in agreement with 

399.93 400.46 B: (( )) 

400.56 402.50 B: (( )) (( the force of the law to um )) 

403.85 404.32 B: (( to go )) 

404.52 405.58 B: i mean if i thought that there was 

405.71 407.31 B: stuff (( )) i think i would not 

407.50 408.57 B: (( )) 

409.05 409.62 B: and uh 

411.42 412.74 B: as painful as it would be 

414.93 415.61 B: (( )) 

417.39 418.14 B: (( )) 

421.73 422.22 B: go ahead and 

424.08 424.74 B: state the truth 

425.81 426.49 B: but uh 

426.05 426.65 A: (( state )) the truth 

428.14 429.74 A: regardless of what the law was 

430.95 431.38 B: uh 

431.83 433.31 B: no no no no no no 

432.12 432.72 A: (( )) 

433.47 433.96 B: uh but 

434.05 435.73 B: but if it were the case where (( i was caught )) 

436.87 438.08 B: what the law states (( )) 

438.79 439.60 B: (( quite happily )) 

438.96 440.12 A: you would perjure yourself 

439.85 441.44 B: would quite happily perjure myself 

441.90 442.29 A: right 

444.58 446.71 B: broken the law on many occasions 

447.85 449.33 B: (( well )) of course i won't say which ones 

449.58 452.24 B: publicly over a telephone 

451.28 454.29 A: (( right )) on a to a complete stranger 

452.38 452.90 B: but uh 

454.47 455.13 B: yeah 

455.40 455.94 B: but uh 

459.23 460.37 B: no i think i think what you were 

466.86 467.26 A: yeah 

467.01 467.34 B: (( )) 

467.48 468.02 B: crazy 

468.13 469.47 B: uh imbalances between 

470.86 471.59 B: (( generally equates )) 

471.92 472.43 B: (( )) 

472.56 473.42 B: anti-social 

474.08 474.51 A: right 

474.86 475.34 A: w- 

475.84 478.86 A: and what is beneficial to the corporations in this country i think 

480.21 480.94 A: financially 

481.62 481.89 B: true 

483.58 484.88 A: you know what we need to 

485.02 485.50 A: well 

485.94 489.33 A: that is a different topic so so i guess 

488.09 488.42 B: (( )) 

488.59 493.49 B: so what what eh no here is a (( )) let's take a poll what so what would uh what would you perjure yourself over 

494.07 496.70 B: like what are some of the the unpopular laws that you would 

497.23 497.59 B: uh 

497.75 498.96 A: unpopular ones 

499.10 502.51 B: the unpopular ones that you would you would be willing to perjure yourself over 

503.67 505.54 A: well i mean that minor their minor 

505.96 506.23 B: yeah 

507.16 508.86 A: (( )) well i mean i think 

509.27 510.71 A: i mean if i knew a family member was 

511.61 515.14 A: smoking marijuana i wouldn't turn my family member in for smoking marijuana 

515.43 515.70 B: right 

516.43 517.34 A: but it would be a case 

516.51 517.32 B: what about the 

517.90 519.02 B: what about the death penalty 

519.51 520.03 B: for example 

519.89 520.17 A: what 

520.54 521.12 A: i'm sorry 

521.14 523.50 B: if you were living in a jurisdiction in which the death penalty 

521.42 521.79 A: well in 

523.68 524.36 B: was was 

525.09 525.37 B: was 

525.64 525.96 B: the 

526.11 527.88 B: ultimate penalty for a capital crime 

528.72 529.51 B: uh 

529.79 531.01 B: would you be willing to 

531.38 531.76 B: um 

532.02 534.15 B: falsify evidence in a murder trial 

535.24 537.03 A: in order to save my family member 

535.42 536.12 B: because you knew 

537.42 538.72 B: or or anybody 

539.23 539.62 B: even 

539.33 539.77 A: no 

540.21 541.01 B: no you would 

541.52 543.80 B: if you knew that that this person was likely to 

544.92 545.60 B: (( )) 

546.40 546.75 A: no 

546.91 547.32 B: okay 

547.54 549.04 B: fair enough 

548.39 549.78 A: would you 

550.52 551.09 B: uh 

552.55 554.69 B: i think that actually is a very tough question 

555.40 556.76 A: well i just don't think that 

556.97 557.48 A: i mean
