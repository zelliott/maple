67.54 68.92 B: desire to listen to them 

69.49 69.97 A: yeah 

70.30 70.65 A: i 

71.09 73.55 A: like me and my friend were just talking about this yesterday like 

74.12 75.26 A: i'm o._k. if 

75.92 77.99 A: my friends make crude jokes around me 

78.43 78.78 A: but 

79.23 79.58 A: like 

79.91 80.64 A: using like 

88.28 92.78 A: but as soon as it comes out of a guys mouth i'm like whoa wait one second 

93.28 95.25 A: i think that's the way i feel about comedians too 

95.80 96.54 B: oh yeah 

97.31 97.79 B: i don't 

98.11 100.32 B: actually like using the crude words for 

100.65 101.95 B: female genitalia or 

100.68 101.03 A: yeah 

102.21 106.65 B: actually any sexual crude words i actually don't like it whether it's a joke or not 

106.36 106.76 A: yeah 

107.27 107.58 B: but 

107.70 108.97 B: i mean i just kind of like (( wince )) 

109.18 109.57 B: but 

109.92 111.86 B: i tolerate it because many people use it 

112.03 112.36 A: yeah 

113.07 113.62 A: i guess 

114.07 114.92 A: i could see that 

115.26 115.70 A: um 

115.99 117.11 A: like my parents like 

118.01 120.21 A: swore a lot in the house when i was growing up so i guess 

120.31 122.75 A: i think it's like a kind of a cultural thing like 

123.72 125.30 A: what your parents teach you i guess 

126.24 126.73 B: (( oh )) 

126.30 126.68 A: (( i don't know )) 

127.62 128.52 B: my parents were very 

128.87 136.21 B: conservative so they definitely never swore or use any of those words especially not use any of those words 

131.25 132.94 A: yeah yeah 

137.02 138.35 B: i actually don't really tell jokes 

138.44 139.22 B: very often 

139.43 140.00 A: oh yeah 

140.11 140.52 B: i don't 

141.03 142.03 B: i don't memorize them 

142.45 142.88 A: mhm 

142.67 145.39 B: i envy those people that have all those jokes at hand and they can 

146.94 147.43 A: yeah 

147.07 148.45 B: entertain 

149.01 151.09 A: i envy like clever people who like 

151.33 152.73 A: can make up a joke on the spot 

153.18 153.57 A: like 

153.39 155.72 B: oh making it up well that's definitely 

155.89 157.29 A: yeah that's beyond me 

156.43 158.62 B: imagine (( me )) talking about that 

159.75 160.32 B: oh yeah

172.59 172.93 A: but 

173.51 178.74 A: i like like steve martin like that kind of humor i like a lot where actually it like takes imagination 

179.13 180.13 A: and it's not like 

182.71 184.73 A: i think my problem with potty humor is that it's like 

184.97 187.17 A: really reliant on those things and 

187.43 189.93 A: it doesn't take like any imagination or anything at all you know 

191.45 191.75 B: yeah 

192.40 195.84 B: i don't really (( )) listen to comedians (( ))

359.78 360.98 A: oh o._k. o._k.

364.05 366.09 B: joke (( )) (( from )) people all over the world 

366.54 367.43 A: whoa 

367.24 367.80 B: hear about this 

368.00 370.59 B: it was some poll i forgot what poll it was but they they rated 

368.03 368.52 A: no 

370.80 372.56 B: it was some study with all these jokes in it 

372.75 376.07 B: everyone from all over the world had to read it and this was found as the best one 

376.52 377.39 A: oh o._k. 

377.58 380.23 B: there's two people they are two friends walking through the woods 

381.11 381.64 B: and 

383.42 385.69 B: and one of the friends all of a sudden 

385.96 387.18 B: drops down (( as if dead )) 

387.63 388.16 A: whoa 

388.20 388.68 B: so 

389.24 392.27 B: the friend is like ah i don't know what to do so he called nine one one 

393.45 393.93 B: and 

394.21 395.23 B: he says to the operator 

395.68 396.87 B: i think my friend is dead 

397.51 398.51 B: and the operator responds 

398.94 400.79 B: well you should check to see if the 

400.91 401.91 B: your friend is dead first 

402.03 403.10 B: you know first and foremost 

403.21 403.93 B: so he is like all right 

404.13 404.59 B: hold on 

404.79 405.57 B: puts the phone down 

405.86 407.71 B: the operator hears a gunshot in the background 

408.15 410.04 B: comes back and is like all right now he is dead 

409.60 410.54 A: o._k. 

413.76 416.30 A: (( )) 

415.80 417.45 B: that is supposedly the funniest joke 

417.77 421.39 B: but it's probably because it's not racist or you know discriminatory in any way 

421.68 422.22 A: yeah 

422.39 422.90 A: yeah 

423.35 426.19 A: there's not like any way i guess you could be offended by that joke 

426.81 427.91 B: yeah 

428.89 431.25 B: i guess it plays on people's stupidity i guess 

431.67 432.14 A: yeah 

431.74 432.42 B: stupid people 

432.87 433.32 A: yeah 

433.65 435.06 B: i think stupid people jokes are o._k. 

435.61 437.15 A: yeah yeah definitely 

437.74 438.34 A: definitely 

439.83 440.39 A: i also 

440.75 444.39 A: like even though i don't like it when like people make fun of people i actually like 

444.76 447.70 A: when my friends and i make fun of each other i'm fine with that 

447.53 449.72 B: oh yeah that's fine 

448.23 448.52 A: yeah 

448.78 453.52 A: yeah that's weird that they did like a whole poll of rating jokes 

454.46 454.88 A: like 

456.04 457.17 A: i wonder i wonder 

457.33 461.06 A: i don't know that just seems really strange to me it would be like rating songs or 

461.36 462.45 A: books or something i guess 

463.92 465.75 B: i'm sure it's not very reliable because 

466.13 472.47 B: there's so many jokes there and and for every person to rate it they would have to read through all the jokes i'm sure everybody was just selective on which ones they rated 

472.81 473.24 A: yeah 

473.50 473.87 A: yeah 

475.63 476.36 B: so i mean 

477.61 478.02 B: yeah 

478.46 480.10 B: but you know it just interesting anyway 

480.64 481.53 A: yeah 

481.19 485.16 B: i knew that was i i was telling that to different people and and they were like 

485.29 487.87 B: no way that's not the funniest joke it's not that funny 

488.22 489.10 B: but (( )) laugh 

491.24 495.09 A: hm yeah i have to say like i've laughed harder at other jokes 

495.85 496.28 A: but 

497.29 501.55 A: i don't know maybe it was like the circumstances or the context where i was told the joke you know 

501.96 502.42 B: yeah 

502.07 502.37 A: in- 

504.47 505.03 B: definitely 

507.42 507.79 B: my 

507.91 509.16 B: roommate was trying to tell 

509.78 510.42 B: this joke 

510.63 511.05 B: about this 

512.09 512.49 B: amish 

512.72 514.74 B: farmer and i totally did not get it 

515.14 518.29 B: and that definitely wasn't funny she just went on and on about something and 

519.27 521.06 B: i didn't get the punch line at all 

521.32 522.77 B: like well think about it you'll get it 

523.35 528.36 B: because (( if )) she got it after a week all of a sudden she's like oh but you know it's been a month and i haven't gotten it yet 

528.43 529.54 A: do you know what the joke was 

530.92 532.62 B: i was (( )) it was about some 

534.06 536.77 B: oh no no it wasn't amish it was zen it was a zen farmer 

537.45 537.83 A: zen 

538.58 539.03 A: o._k. 

539.89 543.00 B: you know i don't maybe it's because i don't know anything about zen enough 

543.55 545.99 B: so i didn't get it but it was just some guy who trying to sell his 

546.99 547.41 B: farm 

547.63 548.01 A: uh-huh 

547.94 548.71 B: to this couple 

549.05 551.11 B: and he kept on going around saying well i have 

551.75 552.13 B: these 

552.53 554.62 B: w- th- these white sheep and these black 

554.72 557.01 B: sheep and the white sheep are really really good and
