320.15 321.71 B: again so 

320.76 330.33 A: you know i think that that idea that you said that huh it depends upon who your best friend is and you said your husband is your best friend now 

329.70 330.32 B: mhm 

330.48 335.44 A: then uh i can understand why you wouldn't take the money that's a very

344.21 344.80 B: yeah 

347.17 348.41 B: oh yeah 

348.35 351.68 A: and uh that's a good way of defining friend i think

353.29 353.94 A: yeah 

355.32 356.43 A: yeah 

356.60 362.26 A: but it seems like you know like uh we have higher pursuits than money that huh 

361.65 362.54 B: yeah 

362.52 367.17 A: money doesn't mean everything to us even though it's a million dollars sometimes 

367.28 368.47 A: what you have 

368.82 370.79 A: in relationships is so much 

370.89 374.03 A: worth so much more than uh money you know 

373.70 378.05 B: yeah even sometimes we can earn million dollars 

378.34 378.85 A: yeah 

378.47 379.36 B: but we can not 

379.90 382.66 B: have the good relationship with the 

382.81 384.72 B: hm the people around us 

384.91 385.46 A: mhm
