47.06 52.02 B: really you know they are pulling people aside randomly and checking all their bags and 

52.28 53.43 B: so that's kind of a 

54.49 55.42 B: a way to 

55.70 56.49 B: to cure 

57.48 60.16 B: (( flights )) better than they were before maybe 

60.96 63.48 A: yes and in this way i think uh 

63.97 65.53 A: people are more uh 

66.74 67.42 A: don't 

67.66 72.99 A: are (( )) airport because they are sure somebody is taking care of them 

74.77 76.32 A: they have more security 

77.02 77.77 B: right 

78.07 79.71 A: and better than before 

81.23 85.39 B: i have a friend who works for the airline industry and uh 

85.98 90.59 B: (( he was )) he was talking about the process of introducing higher powered scanners 

90.75 92.49 B: you know so like scanners that 

102.47 103.86 B: obviously do carry-on 

104.34 106.25 B: that's the real problem so (( )) 

106.58 110.00 B: gives me some comfort i hope it works but um 

111.06 111.84 B: but yeah 

112.84 114.97 A: yeah (( )) because i am 

115.11 116.98 A: i am bulgaria in fact 

117.51 117.95 B: uh-huh 

118.26 119.60 A: and uh when i 

120.04 124.14 A: came initially when i came from bulgaria they didn't check us 

124.45 127.13 A: so well but i changed (( air france in )) 

127.33 128.06 A: germany 

128.48 130.82 A: and from there they begin very serious 

130.94 135.00 A: checking of our luggage and even they made our shoes 

135.38 136.11 A: go off 

136.44 137.88 B: uh 

138.02 138.65 A: so (( )) 

138.23 141.87 B: was that was that strange to have your take your shoes off 

140.27 141.25 A: yeah it was weird 

141.86 150.04 A: strange for me but (( )) what i think that is in all the airports no matter whether the flight is to u._s. or not 

150.17 151.63 A: they should make the check 

152.64 154.64 A: because the risk could be everywhere 

165.33 167.98 B: especially (( )) something like september eleventh where 

168.87 178.96 B: you know hundreds of people died that were not you know necessarily americans so i i felt like it was kind of a world attack so i feel like everybody should be more cautious 

179.39 181.96 A: yeah but you know when it happens once 

182.88 187.76 A: then people begin to pay attention otherwise they don't think this will happen to them 

183.31 183.81 B: that's true 

188.38 189.32 B: that's true 

189.47 190.34 B: that is true 

193.80 194.94 A: also about the 

195.38 196.56 A: security checks 

197.15 199.09 A: uh i don't think that this the 

199.38 200.55 A: uh damaged 

200.82 202.74 A: because you have to (( arrive earlier )) 

203.12 205.31 A: they are p- pretty good organized 

203.30 203.65 B: mhm 

205.44 207.80 A: so everything passes quite quick 

208.22 208.86 A: quite fast 

208.99 210.77 A: and they don't waste your time 

211.84 216.15 B: yeah that's true i have only seen one time where (( )) 

225.63 228.58 B: that was in a small airport so maybe 

228.89 235.88 B: the smaller airports are having a harder time dealing with it than the ones that are you know well stashed and stuff like that 

236.22 240.53 A: but what was that uh the very beginning of the introduction of those measures 

241.13 242.18 A: or it was like 

241.47 242.53 B: actually 

242.79 245.56 B: it was recently yeah it was uh it was in a uh 

245.97 253.48 B: in an airport in the hawaiian islands so (( )) the process just took forever so 

252.63 257.57 A: yeah (( probably )) uh the officer there are not used 

257.71 259.78 A: to dealing with that stuff 

266.97 267.27 B: (( )) 

267.39 273.33 B: this is it just more people are there to look at things or are people that are trained to do 

273.79 274.84 B: the searches 

275.51 279.68 A: yeah that is important issue they they should train more people 

280.01 281.62 A: so that everything goes quicker 

283.57 289.63 B: um one time last year when i was flying from hawaii to the main land i uh 

290.34 293.56 B: we were at the we were at the airport when uh a s- 

293.67 296.92 B: a security officer had planted 

297.07 298.87 B: a fake gun in 

299.29 300.93 B: uh somebody's bag to test 

302.20 304.58 B: security searchers that were using the uh 

305.10 308.32 B: x-ray machines for luggage (( carry-ons )) and 

318.83 323.66 B: luggage had gotten into the hand of the owner to call the claim like this guy has got a gun 

323.93 325.11 B: and it was you know it was 

325.41 328.89 B: totally testing them to see if they were really you know 

329.34 336.41 B: well trained to catch it and it just blew out everything you know it was crazy everybody had to leave the airport and it was really just 

337.01 338.31 B: you know one person 

338.52 342.14 B: being kind of insecure about their position so 

342.38 343.40 B: really tricky 

343.56 345.33 A: yeah that (( )) 

345.48 346.44 A: it was a good 

346.68 348.26 A: (( trick )) how they work 

353.12 356.54 B: you know fake guns to test people who are 

357.72 358.56 B: luggage 

358.80 359.10 A: (( )) 

360.11 370.79 A: on one hand it is a good idea so that they can check their personnel but on the other hand i think there are (( other )) around this could be really dangerous for them 

370.96 372.94 A: (( because )) you know people who are not uh 

373.44 374.05 A: (( )) 

374.25 377.82 A: a little nervous this could ruin their flight and 

375.94 376.65 B: mhm 

378.39 380.34 A: (( )) condition 

381.40 382.27 B: (( )) 

382.01 384.80 A: i really don't know what compromise should be made 

385.17 386.28 B: hm 

386.51 387.20 B: yeah 

388.57 389.56 B: that's true 

390.21 391.71 A: there should be something 

392.49 394.63 A: to be invented but i think for now the 

394.89 396.61 A: technologies are quite good 

397.16 398.00 A: detecting (( )) 

399.04 399.68 B: mhm 

399.81 400.35 B: mhm 

400.91 403.00 B: what did you think about well at least 

404.75 407.99 B: security was incre- increased um 

414.59 422.52 B: pocket knives and things like that do you think that that's going too far or do you think that that's also a good precaution 

422.93 427.25 A: yeah uh but you shouldn't carry them in your handbag but you can 

427.44 429.13 A: pack them in your luggage 

429.38 429.90 A: with your 

429.61 430.76 B: oh that's true (( )) 

430.62 431.79 A: (( )) 

430.90 431.23 B: (( )) 

432.29 433.76 A: and besides these are not 

434.25 439.70 A: things that are so expensive so you whenever you go you can buy them if you don't have (( check- )) 

439.82 440.95 A: check-in luggage 

441.75 443.64 B: that's a good point i agree 

443.77 444.31 B: yeah y- 

444.44 450.13 B: n- not something that people absolutely have to have with them on their twelve hour flights 

449.57 450.65 A: yeah 

450.32 457.14 B: not so necessary to clip your fingernails on the on the airplane it's kind of gross 

457.27 458.06 A: yeah 

457.75 458.45 B: but uh 

458.74 463.83 A: and another issue that i am concerned is whether because once you go to the 

464.10 466.16 A: through through those security measures 

466.72 469.62 A: there is a big space over there and somebody could 

469.72 471.85 A: sneak in and leave something there 

472.32 474.54 A: so that anybody comes (( and take it )) 

474.88 475.64 A: (( i really )) hope 

475.75 476.21 A: they 

476.89 477.21 A: do 

477.34 479.70 A: (( )) security checks to those places 

480.58 482.40 A: where you are waiting for your flight 

483.14 485.70 B: right because a lot can still happen there 

485.87 490.88 A: yeah because you have plenty of time and there are so many restaurants and even 

491.01 491.54 A: those 

492.51 494.48 A: nobody knows what could happen 

496.43 500.91 B: yeah but then then you have to wonder how can you 

501.44 502.09 A: it probably 

501.60 505.64 B: how ca- how far can you go with protecting people's privacy like 

505.92 511.81 B: you know putting cameras in bathrooms to watch people making deals or something i don't know 

512.16 513.94 A: oh a- another thing that 

514.34 516.48 A: another idea that c- that comes to me 

517.18 518.74 A: before you go into the gate 

519.19 520.87 A: the place you go in the plane 

521.25 524.52 A: (( if )) they make such a detectives over there 

525.01 526.09 B: ah 

526.24 526.61 A: which is 

527.42 529.57 A: (( )) before you go into the plane 

530.78 531.56 A: i think they can 

530.99 531.68 B: (( now that's )) 

531.73 532.66 A: (( )) 

534.40 539.86 B: it makes more sense to do that there rather then where we normally have to go through 

540.02 541.20 B: you know there is so much 

541.61 552.49 B: that happens and that you can pass through between coming through to check your luggage and going to the gate you know so i agree if there is another 

553.30 558.04 B: screening or something to go through before getting on the plane that might 

558.40 560.90 B: prevent even more problems maybe
