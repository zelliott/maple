59.03 59.77 A: the first thing 

60.31 61.27 A: that i would do 

61.82 64.02 A: would be look to my water filters 

64.67 65.62 A: and uh 

65.75 68.02 A: get a couple fifty five gallon drums that i 

68.77 69.74 A: that i know of 

69.77 70.26 B: mhm 

70.82 76.38 A: remain calm in that kind of a situation i think i would remain calm what are you going to do go frantic for five days 

76.54 87.53 B: yeah yeah that's what i was thinking i- it depends on what kind of the what kind of attack it is if it's a sudden explosion or something it would be hard to remain calm but if it was 

88.36 90.76 B: you know over a period of time i think 

90.93 92.35 B: more people would end up 

93.30 95.92 B: staying ah you know not panicking and 

96.24 97.78 B: being more realistic about it 

98.28 98.60 A: yeah 

100.00 101.91 A: in the uh in a situation 

102.11 104.44 A: of a bomb now that would be interesting 

103.19 103.77 B: mhm 

104.56 104.96 B: mhm 

104.63 107.59 A: for example in the situation that the russian 

108.17 109.69 A: found themselves in eve 

110.30 113.46 A: where the where the where the terrorists basically took everybody into 

113.97 115.05 A: what was it a theater 

115.43 115.96 B: oh 

116.78 117.31 A: and they 

117.91 118.65 A: they uh 

119.68 122.35 A: well i would call them terrorists they held everybody ho- 

121.46 122.22 B: yeah 

122.59 124.00 A: held everybody hostage 

124.05 124.52 B: mhm 

124.91 125.70 A: and uh 

126.48 127.98 A: and they let a few people out 

129.03 131.42 A: that would certainly be a kind of a terrorist attack 

131.39 140.83 B: yeah sure i mean that's the whole point the whole that's why they're called terrorist you know they're trying to strike fear in the hearts of the people they're against 

132.56 133.13 A: and 

140.67 141.06 A: yeah 

141.09 142.04 B: so 

142.19 143.42 B: it seems like 

144.02 145.32 B: if that's the point 

145.47 147.72 B: and if they know what they're doing 

148.38 152.62 B: it would be hard to stay calm in any you know situation if there 

152.76 156.87 A: yeah but i i think i'm the kind of a guy that'd say blazes with you 

157.16 158.81 B: yeah 

157.41 164.18 A: you want me to be terror- you want me to be terrified nuts i'm not going to give you the satisfaction 

160.95 161.58 B: yeah 

163.13 165.74 B: that's true that's very true 

165.05 165.83 A: yeah i- 

166.08 166.70 A: i think i'll 

166.91 167.93 A: i think i'll stay calm 

168.18 168.67 B: mhm 

168.86 171.57 A: i think we'll stay calm and take care of the uh 

171.98 174.97 A: take care of the little children and take care of the weak and of the infirm and 

175.14 175.62 B: mhm 

175.50 175.84 A: and 

176.02 176.86 A: make sure that 

177.65 181.18 A: as much aid and help can be given there's no use in going frantic 

181.59 189.90 B: and also because it's been discussed for such a long period of time now in the media and you hear about it a lot i think the 

186.78 187.87 A: uh-huh 

190.33 196.49 B: impact of the effect of surprise wouldn't be so great as it was september eleventh 

195.48 196.03 A: yeah 

196.95 197.54 A: that's true 

197.57 198.15 B: you know 

197.95 200.31 A: that's true and there's one other point 

200.30 200.63 B: mhm 

200.54 201.00 A: um 

201.88 202.79 A: my religion 

203.67 205.62 A: gives me a lot of answers 

205.69 206.17 B: mhm 

206.38 209.42 A: a lot of answers and so so i don't have the 

209.78 211.50 A: fears and the terror of 

211.91 213.05 A: death for example 

213.49 213.89 A: um 

214.69 215.15 A: uh 

215.69 216.33 A: because 

216.71 218.92 A: because of the way that i believe i i 

219.16 225.10 A: feel very comfortable and confident that uh for example i'm a christian so i feel that 

225.28 225.99 A: because of 

226.32 231.23 A: my beliefs of christ and the resurrection and life after death and things like that it 

230.77 231.09 B: mhm 

231.40 232.14 A: it's uh 

232.99 234.34 A: there's nothing to be afraid of 

234.52 241.20 A: i don't want to die you know because i do like it but i do have a forward view 

235.75 237.55 B: yeah sure 

238.80 239.32 B: mhm 

241.71 243.26 A: of life going on 

243.83 246.41 A: and and continuing to go on and so 

247.15 249.71 A: and so that really changes my outlook 

249.91 250.31 B: mhm 

250.62 255.56 A: and gives me a lot of peace i- takes a lot of the fear out of even a death 

255.90 256.69 A: situation 

256.89 257.92 B: i can understand that 

258.83 259.92 B: that makes a lot of sense 

258.91 259.42 A: yeah 

260.45 261.37 A: it helps a lot 

261.59 262.09 B: mhm 

262.27 263.83 A: how about yourself d- you do you have 

264.44 268.37 B: well i try and think about death realistically 

268.54 269.47 B: well 

270.37 270.77 B: um 

271.57 274.19 B: i would say that i'm not afraid of death 

274.75 276.30 B: just because it's 

275.04 275.38 A: good 

276.81 277.48 B: a 

277.70 285.60 B: well you know it's a natural process and you know everybody will die at some point so being afraid is not really 

282.33 282.75 A: yeah 

285.72 290.41 B: productive i know that's a ridiculously logical way to look at something i i'm sure that 

290.55 295.36 B: in the given situation i would probably be very afraid just because 

296.11 298.66 B: the emotions would kick in and 

298.09 298.81 A: oh yeah 

298.79 301.56 B: things like that you can't control so much of that you know 

299.89 300.33 A: yeah 

301.92 305.30 A: that's right fear is one thing being frantic 

303.81 304.31 B: mhm 

305.43 306.01 B: yeah 

305.87 307.28 A: and and panicky 

307.41 307.82 B: mhm 

308.27 312.82 A: and losing control of your of thought process and reason is something completely different 

312.87 313.44 B: yeah 

313.85 314.62 A: i can definite- 

313.95 314.77 B: and i think 

314.91 319.10 B: yeah in the situation like what you referenced before the uh 

319.24 328.12 B: something happening to the water i remember my uncle at one point was working with some company researching um 

328.78 338.14 B: uh contaminants in the water in a in a town i'm no- and in some some large city i'm not sure where but they were studying the contaminants in the water 

334.44 334.85 A: uh-huh 

338.26 342.44 B: in relation to high percentage of 

342.54 345.34 B: people contracting cancer in the area 

345.05 345.69 A: oh really 

345.75 348.36 B: and it was this highly controversial 

348.68 349.26 B: uh 

349.44 352.03 B: set of data because they couldn't 

352.23 360.79 B: just go out and release information like that but then on the other hand they couldn't really keep something like that from the citizens you know 

359.91 361.12 A: boy that's yeah that's right 

361.17 363.46 B: so that whole 

363.87 365.39 B: panic inducing 

365.83 368.08 B: the theme you know comes into play 

368.58 371.73 A: was there a lot of panic in that situation when they did release the 

371.80 373.49 B: i'm not exactly sure 

372.19 372.73 A: data 

373.66 376.47 B: what end u- what ended up happening with that 

376.60 379.47 B: maybe they did more research and it didn't prove to be 

377.04 377.67 A: huh 

380.02 384.90 B: that big of a deal but i'm sure if it was that big of a deal they would have to release it 

385.62 387.51 B: i'm not s- i'm not exactly sure 

387.26 388.00 A: yeah they'd have to 

388.29 388.71 B: yeah 

388.94 389.55 A: they'd have to 

389.67 390.09 B: mhm 

390.00 392.76 A: what would uh you do in a situation for example 

393.04 394.11 A: in the airplane 

394.57 398.20 B: oh see now the airplane thing was 

404.49 405.47 B: -cause first of all 

405.99 411.89 B: you're in a small space with a lot of people and since emotions like that are contagious 

412.58 413.37 B: and 

413.52 414.62 B: you know you're 

414.95 415.42 B: it's 

415.70 416.02 B: i- 

416.55 417.83 A: i see what you're saying yes 

417.36 419.01 B: yeah um 

419.71 427.92 B: but on the other hand the plane that went down in pennsylvania their the amount of control that those 

428.29 429.03 B: people had 

429.18 431.35 B: could also be contagious you know if 

431.59 433.01 A: yeah you know 

432.11 433.02 B: you have 

433.17 434.47 B: a strong leader 

434.91 436.26 A: what an excellent point 

436.70 437.85 A: the contagion 

436.83 437.35 B: huh 

438.20 438.76 B: yeah 

438.38 439.92 A: that contagion factor 

440.00 440.52 B: mhm 

440.30 441.22 A: so if you have 

441.90 442.74 A: if you have 

442.99 445.61 A: a couple of people who can really lead 

445.97 446.29 B: mhm 

446.21 452.02 A: in a in a okay everybody here's the situation let's really keep our heads and 

449.49 450.05 B: mhm 

451.56 451.92 B: mhm 

452.24 452.56 A: and 

453.45 459.93 A: discover a couple of active steps that we can take to be pro-active instead of reactive or reactionary 

458.75 459.21 B: mhm 

460.01 460.43 B: mhm 

460.75 465.36 A: something like that that would be good plus they had a little more time it seemed and more information 

461.60 462.20 B: yeah 

465.82 467.11 B: yes yes 

466.95 467.86 A: information is 

467.95 468.33 A: is 

468.49 469.80 A: really necessary 

469.77 471.87 B: right and that's also 

472.10 472.79 B: i think 

472.89 478.71 B: i- l- um goes along with the amount of talking and 

487.83 492.87 B: that that information will help us be more realistic in 

488.06 488.49 A: yeah 

493.70 495.81 B: in some kind of terrorist attack 

494.82 496.79 A: i- in in finding solutions 

496.76 497.25 B: mhm 

497.54 499.85 A: it seems like the solution to terrorism 

500.69 502.02 A: is keeping your head 

502.14 502.56 B: mhm 

502.70 503.49 A: finding 

504.09 505.61 A: what the challenge is 

505.69 506.03 B: mhm 

506.06 507.02 A: and believing 

507.33 507.80 A: that there 

507.91 509.47 A: are solutions to it 

509.67 518.57 A: find out ye- okay how are we going to solve this because what they're trying to do is cause damage how do we stop the damage reverse it 

509.90 510.37 B: yeah 

519.00 519.36 B: mhm 

519.46 520.55 A: and and i- 

520.91 522.52 A: i wonder if you can even use 

522.75 523.88 A: something like that for 

524.88 525.21 A: well 

525.97 528.13 A: i guess when the plane in pennsylvania went down 

528.27 528.66 B: mhm 

528.53 531.31 A: the america is definitely using that terrorist 

531.76 532.72 A: attack 

533.24 534.79 A: to become stronger 

534.97 536.11 B: ye- oh yes definitely 

535.02 535.56 A: people 

536.29 541.34 A: people pulling together more believing in each other more oh i think that's so wonderful 

538.18 538.60 B: mhm 

541.32 544.21 B: yeah and i mean the leader 

544.93 550.39 B: the effect of the leader even if there isn't a leader right there having the example serves a- 

550.87 559.32 B: as that kind of a role you know it's encouraging to have a role model to live up to and like encourage people 

552.97 553.42 A: yeah 

559.57 561.28 B: in a similar situation 

561.54 561.89 A: right 

561.83 563.64 B: to act the same way
