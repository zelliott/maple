58.84 59.57 B: um 

60.73 67.20 B: it's sad and the thing tha- would we perjure to our family or friends it didn't say eh eh eh um 

64.84 65.55 A: right 

67.45 68.47 B: at court 

68.86 70.70 A: yeah it doesn't say at court 

69.11 69.43 B: but 

71.09 75.83 B: but you know and i think a perjure i think of uh a more legal situation 

75.92 77.19 A: that's what i think too 

77.23 79.46 B: yeah so um 

80.02 83.19 B: tha- that's a tough one i i um 

83.33 84.44 A: i know i 

83.99 86.27 B: i had been known to um 

87.19 88.03 B: um not 

89.22 89.68 B: not nec- 

89.79 90.38 B: -essarily 

90.58 91.80 B: perjure but 

92.82 93.26 B: um 

94.76 96.16 A: right exactly 

96.27 97.83 A: like not not 

97.93 98.82 A: lie 

99.17 101.65 A: but just not give the information 

102.06 102.45 B: right 

102.43 103.71 A: basically right 

103.27 103.74 B: right 

103.82 104.25 A: right 

104.26 105.86 B: or at least try to um 

106.48 106.99 B: you know 

108.93 113.45 B: use language that will keep me from saying something that i don't want to reveal 

113.22 114.46 A: right exactly 

114.74 120.02 B: and i think that there are appropriate times especially with the family and situation 

119.76 121.09 A: i know and 

120.61 125.64 B: that um and we're not talking surprise birthday parties here we're talking 

124.45 128.73 A: i know i i think pretty much we're talking about court situation 

128.84 129.51 B: mhm 

129.46 131.62 A: um where you're a witness 

132.12 133.87 A: or or something 

134.00 136.10 A: like you know something about the case 

136.32 136.99 B: mhm 

137.02 140.86 A: um and then for a family member or friends would you 

141.03 144.57 A: lie or perjure yourself to prevent them from 

145.11 146.30 A: being fined or 

147.04 149.06 A: or put into jail or something i guess 

149.60 150.14 A: um 

151.37 154.60 A: i i for me i think it would have to 

155.88 157.89 A: maybe be the circumstances 

158.37 160.59 A: like what are they being accused of 

158.38 158.80 B: yeah 

160.81 161.42 B: mhm 

161.55 163.38 A: um i mean if i had 

163.55 167.18 A: and maybe like the closeness of the family member or friend 

167.48 168.62 B: mhm (( )) 

168.31 168.72 A: uh 

168.85 172.35 A: you know i mean if i had a distant cousin that was 

172.78 173.91 A: selling drugs 

174.19 176.92 A: i don't think i would perjure myself for him 

177.50 178.11 B: no 

177.89 179.05 A: you know what i mean 

179.08 183.93 B: yeah i think it would have to be a threat um that i would have to 

179.56 180.13 A: i mean 

184.04 185.81 B: feel terribly threatened 

185.99 187.11 B: that um 

187.42 189.89 B: that the only way that i could keep my child or my 

190.05 191.96 B: family situation safe 

190.81 191.22 A: right 

192.22 193.70 B: would be to perjure myself 

193.88 195.34 A: right exactly 

194.31 197.71 B: and and that that to me would be uh 

197.90 202.42 B: would still be difficult but i don't think that there's anything i wouldn't do 

202.73 204.90 B: to secure the safety of my child 

205.14 206.73 A: exactly that's true 

207.02 207.67 A: that's true 

208.08 210.12 A: like it should go along i you know 

210.67 214.27 A: husbands and wives aren't allowed to testify against each other 

214.51 215.25 B: true 

214.63 216.58 A: i think the same should go for parents 

216.79 217.53 B: well 

217.03 217.90 A: and children 

225.49 226.64 B: then my child 

227.01 227.52 A: right 

227.13 230.70 B: um you know th- um my child is um 

231.77 232.29 B: you know 

232.76 236.40 B: it's just a more precious it it's a different dynamic than a husband 

235.73 236.72 A: oh definitely 

236.49 237.37 B: you know and it 

237.15 241.09 A: well you feel like a responsibility for your child as well too 

240.00 240.43 B: right 

240.66 251.05 B: right yeah wel- and you feel the responsibility for your spouse too and a a sense of loyalty um that you wouldn't feel for someone else um but it's it's not the same i'm afraid 

241.38 241.84 A: right 

245.68 246.17 A: mhm 

250.45 250.93 A: right 

251.16 254.23 B: um uh you know the the old saying blood runs 

251.17 251.58 A: right 

254.53 255.30 B: thicker than 

255.52 257.88 A: right exactly exactly 

256.11 256.88 B: water is 

257.00 259.56 B: is terribly true um 

258.94 263.29 A: and and for a friend too i don't i don't i think i would be more prone 

263.41 263.86 A: or 

264.23 266.64 A: i would be more prone to do it for a family member 

266.78 267.60 A: than a friend 

267.13 267.73 B: mhm 

267.88 269.06 B: mhm well 

268.15 271.51 A: and you know a really close family member like a a parent 

272.17 273.39 A: or a child 

272.18 272.87 B: mhm 

273.72 275.95 A: or you know something like that 

273.96 274.39 B: mhm 

276.07 279.32 B: yeah but it would also you know i mean it woul- uh i think 

279.42 280.30 B: you know i think 

281.12 286.67 B: oh quick i always try to teach telling the truth and you know being honest with yourself and and ma- 

284.27 285.93 A: i know exactly 

286.03 287.22 A: it's a hard one 

287.39 291.77 B: and having a lot of integrity and all of that other stuff and you know and 

289.51 290.09 A: right 

291.26 296.56 A: and then to live with what you had done i mean there's a reason why we have these laws 

296.74 297.95 B: mhm mhm 

297.31 301.71 A: and if we didn't have these laws and these freedoms then you where would we be 

302.32 306.06 A: so it almost seems like if someone would break a law um 

306.26 308.40 A: and you would have to testify against them 

308.82 311.34 A: would you in turn to do the same so 

312.32 313.17 A: i you know 

313.42 316.32 A: it would definitely have to depend on the situation but 

316.69 321.49 A: you know i'd like to think that i wouldn't just because i always try to you know 

321.65 325.81 A: tell my nieces and nephews the importance of telling the truth for example 

326.11 326.59 B: yeah 

326.23 328.04 A: and teach that to them and 

329.14 332.60 A: and you know just to think that you you had done that too 

332.77 334.83 A: like that's something that you have to live with 

333.35 335.42 B: it's yeah it's a hard thing yeah 

335.37 335.86 A: yeah 

335.95 344.63 B: and it once again i course it would all depend but if you figure if you're in court you're you're talking about something relatively serious here not not not a trivial issue 

342.00 342.79 A: exactly 

343.04 343.77 A: exactly 

344.50 344.93 A: right 

344.86 346.87 B: (( )) right yeah so um 

347.28 351.07 B: yeah i think it it i would just have to feel 

347.73 348.18 A: well 

351.31 352.15 B: you know scared 

352.36 355.02 B: for myself and my family in order to um 

353.18 353.71 A: yeah 

353.97 354.44 A: yeah 

355.52 359.69 B: to to do something like that and fe- and feel that my options were 

360.24 360.90 B: um 

361.52 363.38 B: mm that i didn't really have an option 

363.51 364.06 A: right 

364.24 364.71 A: right 

364.86 365.16 B: that 

365.25 366.74 B: that th- there just wasn't 

367.18 369.39 B: a choice um at least in the 

369.85 372.71 B: you know at that particular moment i mean you want all this 

371.54 372.01 A: yeah 

373.91 378.47 B: likes to think that there's hope and choices will always be there for us to make but um 

377.89 378.49 A: right 

378.58 379.03 B: um 

378.60 380.87 A: but in some situations maybe not 

381.51 382.09 B: mhm 

381.57 382.01 A: right 

382.41 383.56 B: mhm yeah 

383.26 383.98 A: i know it 

384.19 385.61 A: it's really hard to say 

386.10 387.13 A: but with every hypo- 

387.27 390.03 A: hypothetical situation it's hard to tell 

389.10 389.74 B: yeah 

390.34 393.50 A: um how you would actually fair what you would do 

393.63 394.32 B: mhm 

394.33 394.87 A: um 

395.39 396.16 A: i don't know 

397.73 398.50 B: do you have children 

398.92 399.57 A: i do not 

400.21 401.46 A: i do not so 

401.60 402.17 A: um 

402.89 406.06 A: it's hard to me imagine that feeling that you have too 

406.57 408.36 A: towards your children but 

408.14 410.67 B: yeah well i i only have the one but she's 

411.43 413.77 B: she's eleven and she's very bright so she 

413.63 414.08 A: mhm 

414.32 416.72 B: eh you know we have a very open relationship 

416.65 417.49 A: oh good 

417.23 418.57 B: yeah so i do 

418.67 419.64 B: you know i do tea- 

419.82 422.51 B: preach whatever you want to call it 

421.39 423.84 A: maybe a little bit of both 

428.68 429.17 A: right 

432.41 432.84 A: right 

434.92 435.36 A: right 

438.67 440.33 B: (( )) 

440.38 441.40 A: right yes 

440.66 442.94 B: (( )) 

441.50 443.80 A: yeah don't think about the consequences 

443.34 445.88 B: yeah and and you know consequences 

446.35 450.07 B: to them are are so immediate because their life is so short they haven't 

449.09 449.62 A: right 

449.81 450.24 A: right 

450.56 452.60 B: been there to realize that something you do 

453.58 454.41 B: now 

454.61 456.80 B: um can have consequences 

455.62 456.76 A: effect you later 

456.91 461.57 B: twenty five years down the road even though you don't talk about it for the next ten years you know 

457.06 457.52 A: mhm 

458.44 459.27 A: exactly 

461.01 463.01 A: right but it can always come back 

463.07 463.59 B: yeah 

463.93 465.89 A: that's just like in in court too 

464.07 464.34 B: yeah 

466.03 468.02 A: you know you swear on the bible 

468.35 468.89 B: mhm 

469.12 470.22 A: to tell the truth 

471.03 474.12 A: so i'm sure a part of this would have to come in 

474.30 474.87 A: you know 

475.06 476.68 A: how religious are you 

477.44 482.83 A: um you know how seriously do you take your religion and what they like we were talking about teach or preach 

483.21 484.13 A: what is 

484.41 486.66 A: preach to you through your religion too 

486.46 490.62 B: yeah well i i think religion (( )) we um 

491.73 494.92 B: we have three religions here and i always teach at um 

495.22 497.35 B: it's it's not the individual religions 

497.46 498.34 B: but um 

498.57 500.57 B: my my um my husband was 

501.09 501.75 B: born in ja- 

501.91 503.95 B: japan he was raised buddhist so we have 

503.74 504.19 A: uh-huh 

504.06 505.35 B: grandparents that were 

506.00 507.18 B: you know buddhist and 

506.89 507.45 A: right 

507.77 508.53 B: um but he was 

508.88 513.76 B: then lost his parents adopted and raised catholic so my daughter's raised catholic but her grandparents 

511.48 512.04 A: mhm 

513.88 518.76 B: um the the rest of the family in japan is now buddhist and then um 

516.67 517.23 A: right 

519.38 520.28 B: then i'm uh 

520.48 522.18 B: i'm hispanic um but 

521.76 522.34 A: okay 

522.42 523.70 B: but my parents 

524.66 526.55 B: um are baptists 

526.69 528.09 A: that is a variety 

527.90 533.45 B: so and she has been to all the churches she's been to japan for buddhist ceremonies 

528.50 529.30 A: wow 

532.13 533.51 A: that's excellent though 

533.69 534.90 A: that's excellent 

534.69 537.93 B: and i have taught her that it's it's not um 

539.22 540.01 B: religion is 

540.16 541.41 B: is something um 

541.63 545.95 B: very spiritual and very deep and profound and there are many ways to worship 

542.63 543.16 A: mhm 

546.02 546.41 A: right 

546.29 546.73 B: and then 

546.86 548.69 B: the there isn't any single 

549.15 551.99 B: one and that if you look at religions they all have 

551.97 552.45 A: yeah 

552.14 553.83 B: basically the same values 

553.86 556.61 A: mhm oh yeah definitely i agree 

554.42 562.65 B: um and then just the the the way they go about practicing it may be different but she's also visited these countries and she's seen
