7.02 7.75 A: hi steven 

8.56 9.18 A: um 

9.92 11.74 A: so i guess our topic is 

12.42 14.19 A: if we could open our own business 

14.19 14.59 B: right 

14.67 15.18 A: um 

16.43 20.84 A: i don't know if you've been online for awhile so you might have had t- a chance to think about it 

21.58 22.09 A: um 

23.14 24.74 B: i've been uh well yeah well 

24.82 25.91 A: have you been waiting 

25.76 27.54 B: uh no just about half a minute 

27.67 29.17 B: well i guess they called you 

27.69 29.66 A: oh okay 

30.40 32.33 B: uh that's uh that's a difficult 

32.72 34.40 B: question i never really thought about 

34.81 37.02 B: opening my own business i suppose 

38.34 39.20 B: um 

44.46 44.90 B: well 

46.55 48.38 B: (( )) i never really have thought about this 

48.01 49.24 A: oh you haven't oh 

48.87 49.44 B: no 

49.41 52.13 A: okay oh i have although 

52.90 54.90 A: i don't know that i've ever 

55.02 55.69 A: really thought that it 

56.19 57.37 A: be a reality but 

57.22 57.68 B: mhm 

57.95 58.31 A: um 

58.58 63.09 A: and the prompt also talked about if were money were not no object 

63.88 64.33 B: right 

64.28 66.06 A: so um 

66.23 66.50 A: just 

66.68 68.35 A: i guess just thinking about it is uh 

71.13 71.77 A: choice 

73.32 74.80 A: i actually i thought 

75.81 77.95 A: (( )) after i finished um 

78.72 80.12 A: my bachelors degree that i would 

80.23 81.86 A: be an artist because i 

82.00 82.86 A: majored in art 

83.25 83.71 B: mhm 

83.39 84.34 A: as an undergrad 

84.73 85.83 A: and um 

86.71 90.45 A: for a very short time i had a business license to sell my work 

91.76 94.90 A: so that was the first thing that came to my mind when uh 

96.21 96.71 A: gave that a 

96.86 97.64 A: suggestion 

99.92 103.01 A: and i've often thought of having a small retail business 

103.48 104.80 A: selling gifts and crafts 

105.51 107.65 A: would be something that might be interesting 

108.44 110.66 A: so i guess i'm thinking along those lines 

112.00 116.78 A: but i don't know if i'd be a success because i don't feel like i'm very good with money or 

117.99 118.93 A: that i have a very good 

119.46 120.38 A: business sense 

120.99 121.58 A: so 

123.16 125.80 A: so that's sort of where i am with it 

126.01 133.78 B: well i think the uh i think maybe i'll react to what you said first i'm still trying to think i think the idea of um 

130.39 130.87 A: okay 

134.35 135.28 B: selling 

135.57 138.42 B: selling your art or selling something you created is 

138.52 139.28 B: is something that 

140.43 142.02 B: sounds interesting my problem 

142.96 145.07 B: one difficulty with running a business 

145.18 146.40 B: would be the uh 

146.78 148.25 B: the time constraints 

148.46 149.06 A: mhm 

149.00 150.36 B: and i'm not sure that i would be 

150.87 152.26 B: i would be particularly 

152.79 153.31 B: good 

153.44 154.02 B: at 

155.85 156.52 B: um 

157.21 159.94 B: pacing myself and being in charge of the time 

159.90 160.31 A: uh huh 

160.41 161.16 B: for 

161.98 162.29 B: um 

162.49 166.17 B: what a business would require if i were in if i were to be in charge of it myself i 

163.71 164.00 A: uh-huh 

166.70 169.31 B: think i tend to work better when there's someone else 

168.96 169.71 A: mhm 

169.43 171.02 B: saying okay you have to do this by 

170.68 171.55 A: mhm mhm 

171.27 173.70 B: such and such a date or such and such a date 

171.85 172.22 A: mhm 

173.89 174.47 B: um 

177.06 178.73 A: do you think can i ask a question 

178.58 179.06 B: sure 

178.97 183.85 A: do you think that you would either um procrastinate 

184.05 186.64 A: more than you should or that you would be 

187.21 189.18 A: uh um totally consumed 

189.68 190.26 A: but 

190.61 191.13 A: um 

191.25 195.77 A: you know not not being able to limit yourself to okay i'm only going to work from 

196.05 198.77 A: you know nine to five on this and and then sort of 

199.07 200.20 A: have another life 

200.02 201.93 B: oh i think i would totally procrastinate 

201.40 207.76 A: oh that could be that would be a problem 

202.82 204.15 B: totally procrastinate 

207.92 208.97 A: cause i think that 

210.14 212.26 A: i mean i think everybody procrastinates 

212.51 215.28 A: in everything but i i also think that if 

212.92 213.38 B: mhm 

216.66 219.99 A: if you y- either your livelihood depends on 

220.72 222.57 A: you know you getting things done 

222.85 223.31 B: mhm 

223.16 225.81 A: or you have uh a business that's big enough that 

226.38 229.48 A: other people are depending on you for their livelihoods 

230.07 230.61 A: um 

231.72 234.06 A: i you know i get the sense that 

234.50 237.88 A: for myself i think i would you know be there would be a lot of pressure there 

238.21 241.92 A: and so i might over compensate and be just a real workaholic 

242.57 247.89 B: yeah definitely i i think if there were other people if it were a large enough business if other people depended on what on what 

247.48 247.92 A: mhm 

248.36 250.48 B: i were doing i i would feel uh 

250.90 254.51 B: far greater need to immerse myself in it i mean if it were just me i would think well 

251.80 252.57 A: yeah 

253.00 253.32 A: yeah 

254.71 256.01 B: okay who cares 

256.56 257.69 B: and if 

257.07 259.89 A: well and i guess if money weren't really an object 

260.89 262.19 A: that means 

263.29 264.90 A: you know part of that could be that 

265.52 267.87 A: that you aren't depending on that as your livelihood 

268.49 268.96 B: right 

268.51 271.16 A: so i could see your concern being 

271.66 274.78 A: a pretty you know a much more valid one 

275.23 279.09 A: but you know it doesn't matter you're going to be able to live anyway 

279.73 281.26 A: so um 

282.46 282.98 A: so 

283.13 284.80 A: procrastination you know just 

283.27 283.76 B: so 

285.14 286.15 A: putting things off 

286.76 287.15 A: the uh 

288.05 288.76 A: (( )) 

289.03 290.16 A: one easy fall-back 

291.58 295.64 A: but you don't hav- have you thought at all about if you ever 

296.10 296.52 A: could 

296.88 297.37 A: you know 

297.51 301.92 A: rent a business or do what you do do you think you'd be a better manager than people you had or 

302.41 304.55 A: or if there's something that you really love to do that 

305.12 306.12 A: you do wish you could get 

306.26 308.21 A: paid for or 

310.25 314.18 B: yeah this is this is real difficult question i'm still in school i've been in school my uh 

313.71 314.28 A: um 

314.88 315.51 B: my whole 

316.09 319.93 B: life and i don't plan i mean i i plan to go into teaching 

320.05 320.37 A: yeah 

320.16 321.20 B: which of course is not 

321.80 322.18 A: yep 

322.19 323.86 B: i mean that's not being out in the 

324.16 329.21 B: business world as such so it's difficult it's difficult to think of um 

325.18 325.44 A: right 

325.92 326.22 A: right 

331.85 334.33 B: of something that i would put my interests 

333.98 334.43 A: right 

334.68 336.15 B: into um 

337.65 341.49 B: i suppose that like you said i suppose it's some sort of retail thing if i were selling 

342.49 345.01 B: i don't know i could sell music or something 

344.28 345.22 A: mhm mhm 

345.29 347.21 B: that i was that i was interested in i 

348.08 348.71 B: um 

350.59 351.88 B: something where i could 

352.28 353.49 B: where i could bring 

356.07 357.58 B: a product that wasn't just 

359.75 360.58 B: functional like 

360.77 362.28 B: yeah i don't know um 

360.85 361.13 A: mhm 

363.15 369.83 B: appliances or or furniture or something of that nature but something that had some cultural content to it or 

364.02 364.88 A: mhm mhm 

365.10 365.51 A: mhm 

365.65 366.35 A: yeah yeah 

368.48 368.80 A: right 

369.10 369.38 A: right 

370.54 371.06 B: um 

372.49 373.92 B: something along those lines 

373.44 375.99 A: right and if music what you're in school for 

376.56 381.51 B: no i'm in school for uh comparative literature so i could say that i could open a bookstore 

379.40 379.66 A: oh 

381.21 381.69 A: mhm 

381.80 382.32 A: mhm 

381.98 382.66 B: right 

382.59 382.99 A: mhm 

383.08 386.07 B: um i guess that would be interesting because you could always use 

386.48 387.27 B: it seems to me w- 

388.00 388.60 B: the uh 

389.43 390.07 B: the book 

390.55 392.56 B: selling industry you know it's always 

392.98 394.98 B: coming to be dominated by the uh 

395.30 397.42 B: the large chains like barnes and noble or 

396.50 396.89 A: mhm 

397.28 398.02 A: mhm mhm 

397.86 401.02 B: or borders and they do a good job i suppose but there is always 

401.47 402.72 B: room for um 

404.10 406.31 B: smaller bookstores that that would carry 

405.12 405.59 A: yeah 

406.61 407.20 B: less 

407.73 408.14 B: um 

408.44 409.91 B: mainstream works 

409.18 409.60 A: yeah 

409.93 413.22 A: and with someone who really knew what they were doing 

413.57 418.26 A: (( )) i'm thinking of a librarian or you know where you have a a real 

418.71 419.65 A: special knowledge 

419.68 420.13 B: mhm 

420.00 420.51 A: and you 

420.80 425.22 A: could cater to and i guess you know if you didn't if money wasn't an object 

425.83 427.40 A: um so you could have this 

427.80 428.95 A: this bookstore 

429.60 430.86 A: very very specialized 

432.94 436.34 A: and you know you knew you were catering to just a really small clientele but 

436.50 437.15 A: you had 

437.52 440.58 A: an income of you were self sufficient in other ways 

441.41 442.45 A: you know that might be more 

443.87 444.69 A: interesting 

444.82 447.37 B: right there's parts of the question if money were not an object 

447.53 452.89 B: and uh then you feel you'll be a successful business owner that's sort of going across purposes right 

452.31 454.54 A: yeah no it is i think it is 

454.79 455.50 A: and um 

456.38 457.31 A: yeah definitely 

457.48 458.28 A: because i can fr- 

458.39 459.48 A: think of a lot of things that i 

460.36 462.43 A: that i might like to try to do 

462.08 462.57 B: mhm 

462.60 463.09 A: um 

464.32 466.16 A: in terms of running a business i i think 

466.47 468.41 A: you know i thought about oh it would be fun to (( do that )) 

468.56 469.90 A: a decorator 

470.01 470.52 A: um 

470.05 470.56 B: mhm 

471.15 472.30 A: and but i (( )) 

472.70 479.11 A: but always i just think oh if that was how i was supporting myself i don't i just don't think that i would be good at it 

479.79 480.60 A: but um 

482.36 487.65 A: (( )) and i think that just about anything well i don't know if that's true i was going to say just about anything people do 

488.12 490.28 A: you know even as a teacher i was thinking well you could 

491.33 494.57 A: you know depending on on w- what level you wanted to teach 

495.19 496.66 A: because like curriculum you could 

497.05 498.44 A: do um 

498.74 502.54 A: you know this business education going in and doing workshops for firms or 

503.18 503.48 A: um 

507.33 508.75 A: i'm also in education so 

508.73 509.15 B: uh-huh 

509.27 509.71 A: um 

510.08 510.39 A: and 

510.49 512.40 A: and i'm also in 

515.80 516.92 A: probably won't be 

523.53 523.92 A: so when it's 

524.27 525.34 A: since i think of myself 

528.30 529.03 A: manager 

529.41 531.24 A: in terms of where i go and what i do 

535.49 537.51 A: i think when i think of business 

539.04 541.87 A: you know first thing that comes to mind is retail 

541.74 542.22 B: mhm 

542.33 544.01 A: and then maybe something like 

544.32 547.25 A: you know starting up a a startup company or 

547.67 548.75 A: you know the dot com 

549.43 552.40 A: sort of field i just don't know anything about that so 

553.19 553.87 B: no i 

554.15 561.07 B: certainly don't know either i mean you have to come up with how would you go about doing this they ask i don't know anything about coming up with a uh 

561.30 562.73 B: with a business plan 

562.58 564.41 A: no neither do i 

563.35 566.88 B: or a marketing plan or advertising or this sort of thing
