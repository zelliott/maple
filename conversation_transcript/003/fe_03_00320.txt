49.02 52.42 B: so what do you think of the question what is it about perjury 

52.61 61.27 A: perjury yeah actually i have it here in writing yeah do either of you think that you would commit perjury for a close friend or family member 

61.29 63.93 B: but you know that's that's a rough question 

63.78 64.65 A: it is too 

70.17 70.78 A: mhm 

73.50 77.60 B: comes to a point where you would see a family member go away 

77.58 78.16 A: mhm 

77.70 78.53 B: it would be 

78.61 79.82 B: very difficult 

79.88 80.43 A: mhm 

80.04 81.60 B: too uh 

81.79 83.66 B: to not uh 

84.16 85.59 B: kind of fudge a little bit 

85.56 86.15 A: mhm 

86.14 87.26 B: don't you feel that way 

87.29 89.38 A: i definitely feel that way i think 

89.63 91.04 A: i think for a friend 

91.42 96.05 A: maybe i would not commit perjury for sure but a friend is a friend you know 

93.33 94.01 B: right 

95.87 96.48 B: mhm 

96.26 99.88 A: i mean i would hate for my friend to go to jail or whatever but 

100.54 103.84 A: i don't think i would uh risk you know my freedom 

103.49 112.15 B: no but it would also be uh i think it would also depend on exactly how serious you felt the perjury was 

111.96 113.58 A: yeah that's true mhm 

121.96 122.42 A: mhm 

125.27 127.28 B: the narrowness of the law 

127.39 128.00 A: mhm 

127.75 130.18 B: where common sense doesn't really come in 

130.00 130.62 A: right 

130.75 133.19 B: and um i sometimes feel like 

133.62 135.01 B: uh they are wrong 

135.26 135.82 A: mhm 

135.88 140.41 B: so i i think i would it would be a difficult uh decision but 

140.15 143.67 A: yeah i think like you said for a family member it would be a lot more difficult 

143.47 144.00 B: mhm 

144.08 144.66 A: yeah 

144.68 147.07 B: yeah do you have a lot of family here 

147.33 148.27 A: actually no 

148.39 152.72 A: all my family is in russia well i have a husband a son here 

151.78 153.45 B: oh is he russian 

153.91 156.83 A: uh no he is actually an american he lived in russia for several years 

156.70 158.17 B: oh and you met him there huh 

157.12 163.72 A: we met there and we came back and we have a son and actually when i asked my husband this question -cause i was looking at the topics 

163.67 164.23 B: mhm 

163.96 165.14 A: you can get them off the internet 

165.23 165.87 B: mhm 

165.62 169.32 A: hm and i asked him about that and he said well maybe for my son 

169.57 172.20 A: and when he said that i thought 

172.48 176.51 A: yeah it would be tough you know not to help your child i don't know do you have any children 

176.38 177.66 B: we have eight 

177.94 178.26 A: (( )) 

178.45 179.16 B: eight 

179.21 181.41 A: eight kids wow 

180.00 182.40 B: mhm well they are all grown 

182.25 184.80 A: oh okay mine is just fourteen months old 

184.84 186.74 B: oh my goodness you are a new mother 

186.66 187.20 A: yeah 

187.27 188.42 B: oh 

188.05 192.11 A: so yeah it would be hard you know not to help him in whatever way i could 

192.02 192.84 B: i know 

192.69 193.11 A: yeah 

193.15 199.68 B: well i feel the same way so but you know there again we don't really know how we feel until the actual 

200.25 201.57 B: event would happen 

201.59 202.71 A: yeah exactly 

202.70 206.49 B: because it would depend on what the event and uh 

206.86 212.91 B: you would have to know whether or not you were really helping your child by lying or whether or not you were 

211.53 212.14 A: uh-huh 

213.03 216.39 B: um hindering him i mean y- maybe i help it 

215.08 215.45 A: right 

216.57 222.14 B: if you told the truth uh and if it was really something serious he might 

222.48 224.09 B: um see himself 

224.68 225.09 A: mhm 

224.71 226.81 B: what he was doing but 

226.94 231.29 B: like again i don't see how you could say uh yes or no to that question 

235.69 237.81 A: you know it would be difficult for a for my child 

238.23 243.82 A: to commit perjury but also you know i mean you don't want to teach your children the wrong thing either 

243.84 244.32 B: no 

244.17 246.00 A: that it's okay to lie and not um 

246.98 248.30 A: uh you know what is the word 

248.75 250.28 A: consequences not to 

250.41 251.77 A: pay for your consequences 

251.64 254.76 B: right yeah you try to teach them that from the very beginning 

254.73 256.80 A: uh yeah so it is a really tough one 

256.94 257.91 B: you know 

257.63 262.39 A: yeah so i think you are right it depends on how serious it is 

262.38 262.86 B: right 

262.71 263.64 A: yeah 

263.71 266.38 B: and some of those things can be pretty uh 

267.61 270.18 B: pretty uh inconsequential i think 

270.09 270.79 A: mhm 

270.65 271.32 B: but um 

271.55 277.10 B: well we don't know so how long have you been in this country all for a long time 

277.21 278.63 A: about um (( ))

316.09 318.71 B: we didn't feel comfortable there we didn't uh
