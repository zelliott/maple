43.73 44.72 B: plato's closet 

44.87 50.22 B: and the people basically sell like they resell like old clothing or what not

53.19 54.79 A: state college pennsylvania 

54.65 61.19 B: yea so that's a great idea far as huh starting something like that cause their really successful and they also take in local designers 

61.34 61.86 A: yea 

61.90 62.57 B: so that'll be cool 

62.46 64.32 A: oh i didn't know they took in local designers

68.29 69.21 A: wow that's cool 

69.25 69.59 B: yea 

69.90 71.14 A: so what business would you open 

71.49 75.65 B: huh i'd have to be realistic and do something like a lawn service 

75.58 76.08 A: mm 

75.76 78.02 B: like a lawn maintains also 

78.34 83.83 B: design just something i've worked with in the past and it's something i new i could manage real well 

83.97 85.75 B: and i guess it's something that i guess you know 

86.70 89.78 B: you can either sell it and in so many years you could also huh 

90.19 93.02 B: try to branch off and do different types like residential and commercial 

93.27 93.81 A: yea 

93.99 101.18 B: it's not really what i would like to enjoy seeing myself doing the rest of my life but they say that money's not an issue you can buy all the equipment yourself you know and 

98.90 99.74 A: right 

101.73 109.25 B: just basically get your works and what not and start trying to get contracts in residential neighborhoods most of the people just buy those prefabricated homes and 

109.73 114.28 B: take that give them a design something to make their home look a little bit different down the block or what ever and 

116.01 116.82 A: cool 

116.73 117.51 B: yea 

117.66 121.45 B: think of a really nice spa that's the only thing i could come up with 

119.74 123.37 A: yea i know well yea defiantly 

123.11 133.71 B: but i guess money was an issue why didn't we thinking of something much bigger you know what i mean well money's not an issue well than you know i want to start my own video rental company then that i can 

132.72 133.26 A: right 

134.04 135.78 B: you know become a competitor 

136.35 138.46 A: yea that's true all though 

137.24 138.15 B: yea you know what i mean like 

138.61 145.06 A: well that's why i said well the fashion thing if money wasn't an issue then i wouldn't care if it failed i guess 

142.26 143.00 B: ah that's a good 

144.22 146.46 B: then you go right through them and get all the fabrics you want and what ever 

146.23 154.62 A: right right and just try it out and then if it doesn't work out it doesn't work out i'm not really losing much it's like you know 

149.34 149.72 B: right 

150.56 152.04 B: huh i see 

154.98 158.70 A: it's a kind of pipe dream for me right no so 

158.09 158.62 B: yea 

158.83 159.23 B: but that's 

160.18 161.97 B: i thinks that's a much better use of the huh 

162.23 168.97 B: of the question i didn't think about it that way your right if you don't care about how much you lose you know make or break 

168.61 169.13 A: yea 

169.13 170.56 B: so then that's sweet 

170.31 170.80 A: yea 

171.36 173.93 B: i don't know can i guess huh who would be someone who'd be like 

174.25 181.47 B: like the biggest if you didn't want to do anything like huh maybe oh i guess i you want to own your own label what's it called 

180.98 181.55 A: yea 

182.10 182.66 B: huh 

182.40 183.76 A: yea i guess 

184.13 184.51 B: yea 

184.19 189.25 A: i probably would incorporate other designers as well i wouldn't just huh 

189.39 196.15 A: i don't think i have time to sew a store with my own with my own line but hum 

195.06 195.45 B: yea 

197.25 198.26 B: they have a real popular 

198.61 199.74 B: atlanta designer i can't 

199.90 203.42 B: remember his name but he was in a local magazine crave (( )) recently 

203.44 203.72 A: mm 

203.54 208.29 B: and huh they were talking about how he was working for twelve years and he had his own store and 

208.66 216.55 B: he was just one of those die hard guys that just really like he you know he had to put his house up for mortgage and things like that but once his label took off he was 

217.01 221.68 B: he was real set now he owns like three stores and he's getting new york companies to 

222.02 222.69 B: huh like 

222.88 226.84 B: to run his products in his stores

235.77 236.26 A: yea 

236.83 240.57 A: i i i mean i hear a lot about that that's kind why i hum 

252.41 252.86 B: true

254.85 256.18 B: i don't know i work in 

256.39 262.81 B: huh advertising and i don't know it's tuff either was i guess if your working from the bottom i guess that'll be tuff too 

262.74 263.29 A: yea 

263.18 268.74 B: but i guess you working from the bottom then you get your own money and you can invest that it'll be an easier start than investing where your borrowing all you money you know 

268.85 270.73 A: yea how long have you been in advertising 

271.15 271.82 B: ah 

272.10 274.23 B: actually have a degree in advertising it's been 

274.41 276.62 B: actually in the work force for two years 

276.84 277.90 B: two and a half almost two years now 

278.51 281.42 A: yea i've been in the work force for about six months 

281.68 284.59 A: not really doing much i'm temping right now 

284.31 284.96 B: yea 

285.44 286.43 B: i hear you

293.47 296.00 A: really want to do anything long term 

296.04 296.51 B: yea 

296.51 297.81 A: but i've been i've been 

298.19 303.21 A: temping at this one place for a few months hopefully they'll keep me hopefully they'll keep me before i go to school 

303.56 304.05 B: yea 

304.16 310.74 A: so i'm just answering phones and not doing anything wonderful it's a job and i'm glad to have it 

306.17 306.85 B: i hear you 

309.53 310.52 B: it's kind of sad 

311.19 315.67 B: it's kind of sad that huh after the question i wouldn't huh choose to open my own ad agency 

316.05 317.70 B: you know what i mean like if i had really 

316.09 316.71 A: yea 

317.85 318.61 B: you know that why i 

318.74 320.62 B: that why i you know went to school for 

320.89 322.49 B: and everything like that but i don't huh 

323.24 328.59 B: i don't know i guess i couldn't see myself if i really could do it i probably wouldn't want to be in advertising as far as own an ad agency 

326.97 327.50 A: yea 

328.98 330.49 B: or what not goes but huh 

331.50 332.20 B: oh i don't know 

334.22 341.10 A: yea i didn't end up doing any i majored in some public relations i actually took some so advertising class and decided not to go that root 

334.26 334.90 B: what do you do 

338.79 339.26 B: oh yea 

341.47 344.11 B: oh man i went to a cheesy program so i don't think that really 

344.67 353.53 B: they rely prepared you for advertising they gave you from a managers perspective but they didn't give you a like different perspective from each different level of manager like (( )) i think they stuck more 

351.49 351.92 A: mm 

353.71 356.36 B: managerial roll not the creative aspects of advertising 

356.45 358.44 A: well creative aspects of advertising is 

358.72 361.80 A: is apparently extremely tuff to get into these days 

361.91 362.43 B: yea 

362.39 363.32 A: i know hum 

363.58 363.98 B: yea 

363.84 370.64 A: one of my friend that's what she's majoring in and she she really loves it and she went to her 

370.84 378.08 A: hum consular at the school and talked about getting a job and they we're like i don't think so 

378.50 379.03 B: well 

379.15 380.87 B: the think about that is is hum 

381.38 382.81 B: most people don't want to but huh 

383.32 394.12 B: the best place to be creative is if you go with a smaller place and most students don't know about the smaller places they only know about the larger places because a lot of the designers we get fresh out of school they're there for like exactly a year 

386.69 388.26 A: mm oh i'm sure 

394.28 396.79 B: and then there gone because they need that big name on there 

394.40 394.88 A: right 

397.27 400.25 B: their resume and then they wan to move on as soon as possible because 

399.83 400.35 A: right 

400.39 403.52 B: i work in retail advertising and creativity is stifling 

403.74 405.52 B: they don't really allow their designers a lot of 

405.78 406.86 B: breathing room or what not 

407.30 407.86 B: so 

408.31 410.81 B: that's probably why that's a bad experience that's why i don't want to 

411.23 411.95 B: put any money in 

412.07 413.77 B: advertising industry 

413.17 414.27 A: yea 

413.95 414.81 B: screw that 

415.30 421.97 B: the like p._r. even i like i had a lot stronger interest in in college than advertising is now 

419.87 420.34 A: mm 

421.63 422.15 A: yea 

429.44 433.58 A: and i i really wanted to get right into the work force and it's i difficult 

435.40 435.77 B: yea 

435.45 435.94 A: and 

436.10 439.29 A: it's really difficult to get p._r. jobs right now and 

438.70 438.97 B: it like the 

439.11 440.28 B: biggest p._r. huh 

441.03 444.59 B: like far as p._r. as an industry that would be the most business out of new york 

444.25 451.29 A: right i know but i know people who have been in the industry for years and years and they're out of work and they don't have jobs and it's like well 

451.42 455.62 A: they don't have a job i'm not getting a job with not even one day of 

455.79 457.79 A: real p._r. experience 

458.09 460.26 B: what i find interesting about p._r. cause i really 

460.42 461.37 B: huh consider that 

470.37 472.85 B: focus toward or you get some kind of media attention any media attention 

472.99 473.85 B: p._r. is like gold 

474.02 474.51 A: hum 

474.76 479.28 B: and you work all that and the majority of the time you know when your paying your dues as a younger person 

479.61 481.03 B: any kind of writing anything 

481.20 490.80 B: wonderful you do your doing and you really don't get direct credit for you have credit but everybody outside the agency you worked for and the rest of the world actually believes it just happened 

485.26 485.73 A: right 

490.99 491.84 A: right 

491.06 494.55 B: or that the firm that you work for got the credit you really don't get direct credit 

494.84 496.97 B: that's been my experience i worked for a lady 

497.10 497.53 B: that was 

497.75 503.58 B: she no lie kid you not my internship with this lady her name was nancy and she 

503.83 510.94 B: did everything she did for a p._r. firm she had a certain level she was at she made three hundred thousand a year she was the only person in the company 

511.17 512.26 B: she took interns 

512.37 513.71 B: to do the rest of the work she couldn't handle 

514.15 515.53 B: and that's why she had no other employees 

515.77 516.39 A: whoa 

516.44 518.86 B: sick it was like she would do p._r. for hum 

519.20 522.00 B: the big law firms and stuff like that and she 

522.19 525.90 B: her own lady but after that internship i realized i don't know if i can do that man 

525.94 526.46 A: yea 

526.09 532.95 B: she was insane she worked long hours but she just had it down to like a science 

530.77 531.56 A: that's crazy 

533.14 533.69 A: yea 

533.90 542.02 B: i guess i could do that kind of company that would be great if i had my own money i could open my own p._r. firm but you don't really stay in business with p._r. it's about what you do money can't help you 

540.78 543.05 A: yup it's all about connections too 

542.85 543.33 B: yea 

543.68 550.42 B: you can't really pay for connections you can to a certain extent but i mean you can't walk up hey here's a million dollars you know be my friend

548.18 549.02 A: right 

550.22 551.11 A: right i know what you're 

551.37 555.82 A: if i opened up a p._r. business i wouldn't know the first thing to do 

555.91 556.30 B: yeah 

557.06 559.81 B: i don't know i think you'd have to start making media contacts 

559.89 560.94 A: yeah defiantly 

560.44 563.64 B: that that's one thing this lady was good at she would like 

564.04 564.53 B: it like 

564.84 575.05 B: i don't know she was good at patting backs and giving credit you know you do something for me i'll do something for you know what i mean a lot of new reporters would come out like younger reporters would try to come out and like 

570.47 571.62 A: mm 

575.53 583.41 B: and um contact her she'd try to pass them along stories and she'd put a spin on it of course and give them stories where they'll get coverage in the news paper 

583.80 584.56 A: mm 

584.32 586.76 B: so but hum you know it's a give and take 

587.08 588.93 B: i again don't know if you can pay money to 

589.43 594.22 B: work out in p._r. real well you know real strongly and become your own like name and what not

603.84 606.23 A: yea i mean i could defiantly 

606.64 610.25 A: defiantly see doing that but i guess as far as like 

610.63 615.43 A: if i had to go on a whim and pick anything i think i'm more passionate about 

615.66 618.41 A: fashion and everything but to be more practical
