6.77 12.87 B: so um what's the topic is public schools is that what they said 

12.52 17.24 A: yeah is there something wrong with public schools these days and what can be done to fix it 

17.50 19.00 B: okay what do what do you think 

19.74 21.11 A: well um 

21.91 24.68 A: i think they could use some help 

24.46 28.19 B: yeah i think i think that maybe one of the problems is that um 

28.64 32.91 B: that there's not it's just too much of like a one size all one size fits all 

33.10 34.05 A: yeah 

33.70 36.84 B: thing going on you know how the i think that maybe 

37.86 39.11 B: there could be more 

39.34 40.91 B: sort of flexibility 

42.66 47.55 A: yeah that's true and also i mean when so many people are in the class rooms it's so hard for 

47.87 48.48 A: the teacher 

49.17 52.71 A: to uh deal with students who are at different levels 

53.17 59.19 B: yeah but i don't know what could be done to correct it i guess maybe more i guess i don't know if more money would help but i 

58.57 60.64 A: well teachers 

59.98 63.34 B: maybe better teachers maybe taking away some of the um 

63.68 66.87 B: like i guess when when teachers get tenure they can't 

67.50 68.34 B: they um 

68.83 69.62 B: they sort of 

70.29 73.77 B: don't have any real reason to improve i don't know isn't that sort of the 

74.24 74.74 B: problem 

74.79 75.51 A: well 

75.63 85.92 A: uh being on that side myself sometimes it's like when there are too many people all at once in a room there is only so much you can do when you're on on stage basically 

85.75 86.13 B: yeah 

86.16 90.79 A: and if there are students who need more help then the other students get bored 

90.93 93.24 A: and so that's kind of a challenge 

91.13 91.64 B: yeah 

93.45 94.31 B: are you a teacher 

94.90 96.42 A: sort of i'm professor 

95.99 96.99 B: sort of 

96.64 98.41 A: yeah 

98.25 99.62 B: so you have to deal with that 

99.59 100.58 A: yup 

101.13 106.71 B: i see i i couldn't imagine it that's one of the hardest jobs i would think that there is i mean 

105.94 110.56 A: yeah and the bigger the classes the worse it is that i have also experienced 

110.95 112.18 B: yeah i mean 

112.37 114.04 B: i i would think that uh most 

114.26 115.52 B: kids probably 

115.61 119.24 B: first of all depending on the age they just like to screw around anyway and then 

118.81 119.86 A: mm 

119.85 121.34 B: they don't want to learn anyways 

121.32 125.88 A: yeah like finding interesting things that would interest the kids i think would be important too 

126.45 127.01 B: yeah 

127.27 131.11 B: what would you teach you teach you teach older kids like you teach college or 

129.90 132.24 A: yeah actually college college yeah 

132.47 133.92 B: do you teach at u. penn 

133.84 138.14 A: uh no i think this is a national study 

137.78 143.00 B: i have no idea like this is a these people have been calling me three times a night for like 

141.98 142.68 A: i know 

142.80 145.94 A: this was you're the first one that i've actually talked to 

145.45 146.58 B: same with me 

146.51 148.02 A: that's funny 

147.87 150.58 B: i um because i couldn't find that pin number they gave me 

150.84 158.62 A: oh yeah i was really nervous about that but unfor- strangely remembered it 

156.52 158.89 B: i don't know 

158.76 161.38 A: yeah one thing i've that's 

173.63 174.20 B: really 

173.67 174.40 A: oh kindergarten 

174.90 178.94 A: and some kids of course they have parents that can teach them that and others 

179.06 181.50 A: don't and so immediately they start out at 

181.68 185.59 A: hugely different levels and i think that makes it really difficult 

185.82 188.42 B: well yeah i think that some some kids are ready for 

188.65 193.49 B: some kids might be bored and then some kids my be not know what's going on 

190.98 192.27 A: exactly 

193.70 201.68 B: i don't know i think that some um and also there's peop- kids with learning disabilities who have trouble learning how to read the same ways 

201.17 202.01 A: mhm 

202.49 208.41 A: well makes it really challenging for the teacher too because they deal with such huge difference 

209.03 209.66 B: yeah 

215.63 221.11 A: get people kids started learning to read in school so they all have the same starting 

221.28 222.55 A: point 

222.32 222.84 B: yeah 

222.71 225.68 A: that might not be such a bad idea 

225.26 232.45 B: maybe it's maybe the pa- maybe the fact is parents have to have a bigger involvement too but i you're never going to change that i guess 

231.76 233.99 A: yeah yeah 

233.34 234.10 B: because there's such a 

234.21 235.06 B: variety of 

235.49 236.39 B: parents and 

236.95 238.46 A: that's true 

237.24 237.74 B: you know 

238.09 239.89 B: some don't care but i guess um 

240.75 249.78 B: i don't know i guess it is it's sort of depressing i don't whenever i think about the public school system i'm just like i have no idea what to do about it i guess 

250.10 253.91 B: it's easy to complain about it but then it's harder to figure out what the solution is 

253.90 257.98 A: sure i mean it's a big challenge and it varies from 

258.17 258.81 A: like 

258.91 262.89 A: part of the city to another one too s 

264.03 271.01 A: it m- it's not only it's not just the teachers it's not just the students i don't know how to fix it 

264.12 264.57 B: yeah 

271.34 273.77 B: yeah i don't know i mean how do you do you 

273.86 278.31 B: um do you teach are you do you do you lecture is it college or something or like that 

282.19 282.59 B: yeah 

285.64 292.82 B: do you um does it when you teach do you do you have large cla- do you have like a big class or do you um mostly smaller classes 

292.59 294.95 A: varies some i mean they are usually between 

295.08 296.91 A: twenty and close to forty 

297.55 298.14 B: yeah 

298.42 299.61 A: and (( )) 

298.75 303.33 B: at that point the people are usually they're like in college so they're paying attention 

303.83 305.68 A: yeah mostly but 

305.16 306.38 B: and they're interested 

305.99 312.01 A: but the difference between the abilities is still there and when you have forty kids in the class you can't keep 

312.31 313.66 A: on top of them all 

313.90 314.60 B: yeah 

314.67 316.90 A: well i can't anyway i find it very challenging 

317.07 317.65 A: what do you do 

318.48 322.86 B: um i actually just graduated from from school and um i'm 

323.43 325.61 B: with a degree in computer science 

326.15 326.43 B: um 

326.85 327.34 A: great 

327.65 330.08 B: i'm having trouble finding a job now with all the 

330.62 333.29 B: lack of computer science jobs out there but 

333.21 337.69 A: yeah i would have thought this would be a sure bet only very recently 

337.67 339.90 B: yeah i mean a couple years ago i could have just had 

340.10 342.01 B: whatever i wanted pretty much but 

341.78 350.42 A: wow yeah so what was your experience in school did you notice that people were on different levels in your classes and was it a problem 

349.31 349.96 B: um 

350.46 352.60 B: in college or in like grade school 

352.43 354.42 A: is it wherever you remember 

354.52 355.77 B: well i went to um 

356.39 359.38 B: in elementary they i mean they have programs like 

359.86 361.18 B: where you know if you're 

361.32 362.58 B: for the students who are sort of 

362.85 366.37 B: brighter or better they'll send to like and enrichment or 

363.96 364.70 A: mhm 

366.71 368.81 B: some sort of like special you know 

369.29 371.92 B: progra- i that was the like i had these sort of 

372.28 375.54 B: once a week we would meet and um do special projects 

375.77 376.34 B: and then 

376.74 377.41 B: um 

378.00 378.72 B: and also like 

378.95 383.28 B: i mean there's different ways of dealing with it you can you can have like different math classes for 

383.69 388.82 B: um when i was in elementary school they sort of rotated and they had like kind of the slow math class and the um 

383.72 384.50 A: right 

388.54 389.28 A: yeah 

389.69 391.96 B: but when i was in high school it was sort of um 

392.68 394.64 B: it was sort of uh 

395.02 397.46 B: i guess they sort of separated things based on ability 

397.67 398.36 A: mhm 

398.09 398.37 B: but 

398.69 399.49 B: for the most part 

399.59 400.75 B: it's it is 

400.89 401.66 A: yeah 

401.21 402.65 B: when you're when you're in kindergarten it's 

402.75 403.84 B: different you know but 

403.94 409.39 A: yeah but i i have no idea what that was like because i didn't go there 

408.98 412.97 B: you did you go to school in uh where a different country or 

412.17 415.07 A: yeah and i never did go to kindergarten 

415.52 418.55 B: we didn't have k- yeah most places didn't have probably didn't have kindergarten 

417.95 429.49 A: well they did my my younger brothers and sisters went to kindergarten but i didn't for some i i have no idea why first day of classes in first grade that was the first time i showed up in school 

430.52 434.71 A: and i thought it was cool 

432.40 433.42 B: yeah right 

434.37 437.11 B: i don't know kindergarten is sort of a joke anyway i guess 

437.37 438.60 A: yeah 

437.68 439.63 B: you just you just kind of uh 

439.49 443.44 A: but but here they take it very seriously and they work really hard at (( )) 

439.79 440.35 B: it's 

443.22 444.03 B: i guess so 

444.13 449.29 B: well maybe that's maybe kindergarten is an effort to make everyone sort of know where they are when they get to first grade 

449.38 450.87 A: mm 

450.99 453.60 B: anyway has it been ten minutes now or what 

453.14 459.33 A: i i don't know i didn't look at the cl- the clock i i'm sure they'll interrupt us 

458.95 460.47 B: (( )) i don't know i hope so 

460.18 461.74 A: (( )) computer 

460.76 461.48 B: but um 

462.00 464.60 B: but uh yeah i just uh what else about 

464.94 466.92 B: public schools i don't know i um 

467.62 469.06 B: i think that uh 

469.85 475.81 B: someone's got to figure out what to do about it because otherwise there's going to be a lot of problems and i think it it seems to be 

476.38 480.18 B: getting worse i i don't know everyone always thinks things are getting worse but 

477.84 478.50 A: yeah 

479.66 482.26 A: oh i have another idea though i think that 

490.68 499.92 A: by themselves the parents have to do it or help them with it and if they don't the kids look bad in school i think that's not right 

491.84 492.20 B: really 

497.89 498.74 B: that's true 

499.56 502.74 B: yeah i think that's messed up i think that um a lot of times 

503.15 503.94 B: um 

504.28 511.09 B: then if your parents are sort of if your parents don't don't care then you don't do well in school i don't know i think a lot of 

510.43 511.58 A: mhm
