55.58 62.01 B: and and i like to have um flowers so you can not see any place else with unique flowers 

63.13 64.66 A: that sounds like it would be neat 

63.64 64.08 B: and 

64.42 68.08 B: right and then to ah franchise to all over the world 

68.91 70.28 B: (( )) 

71.57 72.57 B: like a bouquet 

72.72 72.99 B: but 

72.83 73.42 A: yeah 

73.10 74.99 B: but from wild flow- flowers 

75.47 78.44 A: have you ever have you ever really thought about doing it before 

78.62 86.44 B: yeah always thinking about it the the money ah the beginning of conversation said money is not the issue but for me it is 

80.33 81.19 A: mhm 

86.56 87.42 B: [laugh] 

87.08 92.90 A: yeah exactly that i think that would be the one thing that i would have trouble with even though they said it you know if i wasn't an issue what 

88.08 88.78 B: yes 

90.57 91.01 B: yeah 

93.06 94.88 A: wasn't an issue what would you do but 

93.12 93.49 B: mhm 

95.35 97.31 A: i was thinking an- that would be the hardest part 

98.17 105.47 B: yeah (( )) jus- just go get a shop and then i have an idea and then put an internet ad and then get started 

106.00 106.36 A: yeah 

106.19 110.08 B: and the highest company employee and train them and get started 

110.91 113.46 B: cause i know how to do the wild flower arrangement 

113.84 117.47 A: have you ever i mean have you worked in a flower store before or 

129.97 135.19 B: taking care of um an- and giving -em idea of each office needs each plant like this 

136.18 138.44 B: but i would like to have this business on my own 

138.81 142.90 A: that would be really neat and so you would jus- you would be in charge of hiring employees an- 

143.75 144.15 B: right 

143.88 147.85 A: taking care of those sort of things and then you said you wanted to franchise if you could 

145.21 145.59 B: right 

152.82 158.40 B: nobody ever had that ah wild flower arrangement i mean it's very unique an- 

156.43 158.42 A: it's a great idea 

158.79 160.68 B: i mean i saw a little bit 

167.96 168.70 A: yeah 

168.01 172.91 B: flower you'd collect from the all kind of different different (( )) 

173.34 175.96 B: so riches it's not in the united states 

176.79 180.40 A: we- i think that's a great idea because i think that people 

180.86 181.66 A: nowadays 

181.80 187.68 A: i don't know i just know from my experience that people like to send gifts or things that are really unique or special 

187.60 188.04 B: mhm 

188.12 189.95 A: and so i think that that would be a great 

190.21 193.69 A: gift because you know you could send flowers but you if you could send 

193.95 195.49 A: a really special flower 

196.05 196.90 B: right 

196.20 199.13 A: that kind of had a bit of a story with it or was from a unique place 

197.19 198.12 B: right 

199.58 201.24 A: then that would probably add something 

204.07 204.49 A: uh-huh 

211.02 217.99 B: but if i i have my own business i use my own idea and then i'll put an ad in internet and then in the paper 

219.12 222.87 B: and that'd be that'd be very wonderful and people would love that it's going to be 

223.08 223.35 B: uh 

223.60 230.83 B: type of flower so you can really sell to them high class people okay everybody not anybody can afford to buy it 

231.35 232.48 A: would you you said 

231.53 233.78 B: going to be expensive going to be unique 

233.90 234.44 A: right 

234.64 235.27 A: right 

234.69 235.93 B: and it's going to be 

236.90 239.19 B: type of flower lasts longer too 

239.82 243.43 B: it's it's just like it doesn't die in two or two to one week or two 

243.59 244.66 A: yeah that's great 

244.83 249.56 A: would you did you said you said something about maybe putting uh you know having your business on the internet 

245.05 245.39 B: right 

249.56 250.09 B: uh-huh 

250.18 252.90 A: that would be a great idea because then i'll i mean i feel like 

253.86 255.96 A: i feel like that's really for a lot of businesses 

256.10 259.56 A: put- having being able to market things over the internet has really 

259.88 262.13 A: made their businesses so much bigger 

259.90 260.54 B: yup 

260.80 264.18 B: first i was thinking maybe i should have eh like a basket 

264.58 265.41 B: eh 

267.63 268.32 A: oh yeah 

271.61 280.04 B: for the basket and people i already made my card and i even put the ad in internet but food basket is not for all year run 

280.32 281.05 A: right 

280.46 284.48 B: okay especially all time people really all looking at (( )) or its 

284.62 291.35 B: their valentines day some eh special time they use it but flower uh they can use it all the time 

291.62 292.33 A: mhm

301.24 301.68 B: yeah 

302.07 305.93 B: i do i do i do i really do i try to do as much i can 

306.50 307.25 A: that's great 

307.01 310.34 B: so which kind of business you like to go if you you decided to do 

309.95 310.47 A: hm 

310.58 315.06 A: i don't know i was i was thinking about it and i was just thinking i'm really i like to do creative things 

315.09 315.85 B: oh (( )) 

315.58 319.51 A: so i you know obviously you know um the the flower i was i was 

319.62 322.58 A: in to what you were talking about with the flower business um 

323.07 329.38 A: actually um i don't know i was thinking i would love to have if if money was not an issue i would love to maybe have an art gallery 

329.84 332.93 B: art gallery oh that would be fantastic i like that too 

330.51 331.87 A: mhm 

333.37 334.29 B: like the painting 

334.52 340.93 A: yeah yeah just i hadn't really i've never really thought about it too much but i was thinking my sister is an artist and 

340.59 341.01 B: oh 

341.22 342.82 A: um she always deals with 

343.24 349.49 A: how to be a business woman and an artist at the same time and so she works through different galleries and 

346.59 347.34 B: oh i know 

349.55 350.94 B: she does she does uh 

350.58 354.38 A: yeah she works through those different ones but you know the gallery owners 

354.76 355.95 A: are pretty much in charge of 

356.43 359.47 A: um you know displaying the art and having um 

360.01 361.30 A: you know different kind of 

361.51 369.76 A: events celebrating the artists and trying to draw people in and for me i just i'm really close to art i really like art and i think it would be neat to 

370.30 374.70 A: you know if money was not an issue it would be wonderful to help artists and also 

374.41 378.66 B: but uh uh yeah they said that money is not the issue so imagine you have the money 

376.97 380.71 A: exactly make it so much easier 

385.76 389.21 B: regardless it's the (( )) first of all you have to have money to 

389.56 390.74 B: have a good insurance 

391.40 391.80 A: yes 

391.41 398.90 B: you have to pay your own ways then and then eh have the money order the material have the money open the place 

399.16 400.00 A: exactly 

400.78 402.90 B: so it does it does the issue 

403.23 405.20 A: yeah you have to have so much money up front 

405.17 405.75 B: um 

405.69 407.45 A: to kind of just set yourself up 

407.96 409.49 A: and then and then to keep 

413.57 413.98 A: yes 

417.49 418.58 B: take a hit 

418.88 420.47 B: no more stuff the time 

419.56 421.80 A: right it takes a time usually 

420.88 430.62 B: time really sometimes is slow pick up and then later on pick up very usually beginning of each business you lose some money so you have to prepare for that 

430.90 431.48 A: mhm 

431.60 434.10 A: exactly you have to kind of ah you know um 

434.55 436.41 A: calculate that in to your plan 

436.26 437.02 B: right 

436.92 439.60 A: for the business yeah i thought about that and i think that's why 

439.71 443.45 A: like that would be another hard part about opening um 

443.61 445.93 A: you know an art gallery simply for that reason is that 

446.21 454.86 B: if you do the art gallery what you going to do which kind of painting you going to use or or you follow which artist mostly or your your own 

453.23 454.54 A: um well i mean 

454.66 457.60 A: my my favorite artists are um 

458.02 459.55 A: like the pre (( )) 

460.01 460.50 B: mhm 

460.20 462.52 A: um kind of like the more um 

463.16 465.94 A: i guess you would say of a more romantic looking paintings 

465.43 465.93 B: oh 

466.41 466.98 A: um but 

466.56 468.05 B: oh so it's not picasso 

468.18 473.83 A: well that's the other thing ah no it's not it's it's older than that but i really like all kinds of art 

472.22 472.52 B: mhm 

474.15 474.59 B: mhm 

474.15 477.46 A: and so i'd probably have a mixture of just about everything in there 

478.34 483.12 A: um and just you know little things like my the kind of art that my sister does she does um 

483.98 485.46 A: you know but hers is more modern 

485.78 486.97 B: hm modern artists 

485.92 486.85 A: so i probably 

487.06 492.05 A: mhm so i'd probably have a mix of different things in there but i'd guess it would also depend on where i was 

491.66 495.46 B: so what she jus- she just start the ah (( )) or does she do sculpture too 

495.78 498.66 A: um she actually does something called soft sculpture 

498.82 499.52 B: uh-huh oh 

499.09 501.42 A: which is um painting on fabric 

500.24 501.08 B: oh that's interest- 

501.58 502.72 B: well that's interesting 

502.69 505.15 A: yeah it's really neat and she paints and she beads it 

505.26 505.74 B: uh-huh 

505.62 506.35 A: um and it's 

506.70 511.79 A: it's really it's it's wonderful i love it and i mean uh i mean it would be ideal if i could 

511.85 515.37 B: and what she used depending for the furniture or she frame it 

512.04 513.73 A: have a gallery to help her 

515.73 517.78 A: um it it actually hangs on the wall 

518.17 519.63 B: oh oh she frame it um 

519.41 520.09 A: mhm 

520.54 521.98 B: i know that's interesting 

522.14 526.55 A: yeah it's really it's really neat so i know it would be wonderful to be able to have something 

526.85 529.57 A: and also i like being around artists and creative people 

528.83 531.90 B: so how you going to buy to to have your own business 

532.66 533.45 A: how would i what 

533.39 534.49 B: how you going to start 

535.08 536.56 A: oh how would i start um 

536.12 536.55 B: uh-huh 

536.80 538.04 A: i would probably 

538.61 542.19 A: um i mean the probably the first thing i would think about is like location 

542.50 543.03 B: mhm 

542.58 545.57 A: you know where could i afford to open a gallery and 

545.92 548.94 A: um where would be a good place where people would go to look for art 

549.23 551.47 B: where are you located are you in eh 

551.11 553.38 A: i i'm in georgia athens georgia

562.33 562.90 A: yes 

564.56 566.79 A: that probably would be and also because there are a lot of 

566.89 568.96 A: different people there and tourists go there 

569.09 569.55 B: yeah 

569.73 571.69 A: um i think that would be an excellent choice

574.09 577.32 B: if you if you can afford it disney be a good place 

575.95 579.36 A: that's true wow you would make a lot of money or at least somewhere in the area 

578.53 580.84 B: right there's lots of people go there right 

586.98 587.78 A: mhm 

595.30 596.13 A: yes yes 

596.30 599.61 B: so i mean i just have to put the advertiser 

599.71 606.93 B: um make a little catalog or uh uh put it in the computer in internet and send it over everywhere 

607.12 607.76 A: mhm
