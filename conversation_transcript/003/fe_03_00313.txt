393.44 395.01 A: [laughter] um 

395.33 398.19 A: i don't know they probably wait till the end of the study 

397.70 398.99 B: yeah maybe 

398.31 400.19 A: that would be the easiest thing to do 

400.27 402.20 A: bookkeeping wise but 

402.25 404.86 B: so th- they can call you up to how many times 

404.55 405.86 A: twenty five 

405.87 407.97 B: ooh that's a lot of money

413.51 416.43 B: yeah i'm scheduled for saturdays and sundays and i'm

426.85 428.73 A: [laughter] 

428.29 432.43 B: i thought about it too because i i thought it was like a quick kind of survey but 

432.77 435.62 A: no no it's an actual conversation 

436.12 438.76 B: i heard about this from my friend she's doing the same thing

637.50 640.27 B: sending a bomb over here or something but 

639.48 642.22 A: i think bush has completely lost his mind

671.57 672.61 A: [laughter]
