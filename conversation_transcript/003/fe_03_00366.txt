36.45 37.82 A: um i 

38.15 40.08 A: believe the topic was uh 

41.17 44.19 A: whether or not schools can ban books 

46.10 46.94 B: yes 

48.48 50.16 A: what are your feelings on that 

51.98 52.91 B: well 

53.77 54.45 B: um 

55.16 57.00 B: (( it is indeed the )) 

57.25 57.97 B: prerogative 

58.60 60.74 B: of the education authorities 

61.68 62.41 B: um 

63.64 66.23 B: because they know probably much better 

66.61 70.04 B: but um i would think this would have to be done 

70.41 74.59 B: in (( )) with the school board of control quite simple 

75.28 76.50 B: to make sure that 

77.39 79.18 B: what ever is being used 

80.40 82.19 B: in uh in school 

83.08 84.45 B: has the approval 

84.75 86.08 B: of the school authority 

86.32 88.82 B: (( )) the knowledge of the school authority 

89.52 91.10 B: uh and that's why i feel 

91.52 92.39 B: the scrutiny 

92.80 94.37 B: whether to ban 

94.70 95.62 B: or to approve 

95.97 97.11 B: should be left 

97.99 99.82 B: with uh the school authority 

100.08 102.90 B: perhaps not necessarily entirely with them 

104.27 105.98 B: and uh what are your feelings 

107.19 107.88 A: um 

108.91 110.78 A: i guess i would say that 

112.94 114.84 A: i mean it would 

115.47 117.12 A: i think it would have to be 

117.73 120.00 A: something broader than a than a school 

120.13 120.70 A: um 

122.09 123.60 A: prepared to have that 

123.84 127.41 A: that much authority i think access to all types of material is 

128.07 128.61 A: um 

129.64 134.27 A: (( )) material and ideas is a crucial part of furthering 

134.64 136.87 A: the minds of children in that uh 

137.51 139.14 A: (( either )) one i wouldn't trust 

139.43 143.51 A: just the the sensing ability of a small body of of people 

144.00 147.30 A: um i guess i i would feel more comfortable if it were something that 

147.98 150.63 A: perhaps the public at large felt was um 

151.76 152.30 A: you know 

152.54 153.43 A: duly censored 

153.96 154.47 B: me too 

155.37 158.11 B: a- a- and how would you say oh 

158.78 159.73 B: the public 

160.00 164.80 B: would have uh an input i mean how far or what 

165.18 168.03 B: constitutes the public to you that should have input 

168.16 169.01 B: within the school 

169.25 175.72 B: or at least in in looking into materials like books and and other usable materials such as books 

176.44 177.45 A: i'm i'm sorry wh- 

178.08 179.03 A: what was that last part 

180.86 183.48 B: wh- what is the degree 

184.08 185.59 B: of what you constitute 

186.20 187.33 B: as the public 

187.98 190.51 B: when you're saying the public should get involved 

190.88 191.40 A: right 

190.88 191.54 B: as well 

191.92 192.34 A: right 

192.98 193.49 A: um 

194.99 205.48 A: that's a tough question i think most i mean most if i just think back to most works that have been banned are usually they're not literature that's just coming out i mean it's usually 

205.92 206.57 A: um 

207.46 209.03 A: you know decades old or 

209.17 212.43 A: centuries old for that matter and um 

213.20 214.48 A: has been read by 

215.56 218.45 A: by scholars and lay (( )) people as well 

218.88 219.83 A: and i think 

220.05 220.76 A: um 

221.53 223.16 A: i mean there's al- there's always 

224.96 225.53 A: a public 

225.90 231.47 A: i mean i guess it it's not too public but there's always a debate about the merits of books that have been banned 

231.79 232.50 A: and i think 

232.96 233.59 A: um 

234.71 237.30 A: teachers and parents and 

237.63 240.82 A: scholars outside of the public school community can weigh in 

241.22 242.31 A: and um 

244.04 246.42 A: and argue for the um 

246.23 250.89 B: yeah i i think you're right you're right that there's nothing um 

250.99 255.93 B: to worry about um the questions is the (( modality )) 

256.43 257.87 B: of of how 

258.21 260.44 B: we should involve the public 

260.66 261.45 B: quite simple 

262.18 262.78 B: to 

263.47 264.58 B: explicitly 

265.11 266.27 B: and 

266.60 267.12 B: and 

267.74 270.14 B: you know willingly come (( )) 

270.64 271.20 A: uh-huh 

271.21 274.93 B: to get to know what kind of materials are coming into the school 

275.56 282.23 B: and how they should uh sort of give that input towards the banning of those materials should they regard them 

275.57 276.09 A: uh-huh 

282.52 283.56 B: um acceptable 

283.96 284.51 A: right 

286.28 287.58 A: yeah i mean it's a 

288.84 292.07 A: it is a tough question and unfortunately i don't think enough people are 

292.59 297.63 A: a. aware of such literature and b. invested in the education of 

297.77 299.32 A: of youth to really 

299.45 302.45 A: take the time to weigh in on these matters um 

302.81 306.36 A: so it does kind of leave you with just a few people who do have 

306.46 310.99 A: that sort of investment that uh that are making the decision um 

311.87 312.65 A: but i guess 

313.68 318.05 A: i i i wouldn't be for just a blanket censorship 

318.44 319.07 A: perhaps 

319.34 322.09 A: students can have access to these books maybe it's not 

322.47 325.05 A: a required a course reading or it's um 

325.52 327.04 A: you know not something that's 

327.44 329.84 A: sponsored by the school but to not have access 

329.94 330.51 A: to it i 

330.75 331.39 A: i would 

331.99 333.18 A: i wouldn't support that 

333.42 335.51 B: that's right and the 

335.71 341.23 B: the topic is a is a bit broad and to my extent i mean to my understanding um 

337.96 338.45 A: it is 

342.03 351.14 B: uh it it needed to be narrowed down probably because we do not really have an idea of what kind of books are being referred to 

351.20 351.80 A: right 

351.70 353.73 B: um when i was a young 

353.96 354.74 B: a young boy 

355.20 355.85 B: um 

355.96 363.57 B: when i went to school i remember during my school days i was not allowed to read quite simple what we re- what we call 

363.98 365.31 B: uh those days 

365.77 366.77 B: uh (( scene )) 

367.24 369.43 B: these type of books with um 

370.06 372.37 B: with uh violent scenery 

372.81 373.62 B: and 

372.91 373.39 A: uh-huh 

374.36 379.14 B: they they would contain some kind of uh vulgar vulgar language 

379.21 379.72 A: uh-huh 

379.80 381.45 B: and they would have uh 

382.05 383.76 B: uh pictures about sex 

384.11 386.85 B: and we were not allowed to read these books in school 

386.97 388.07 B: i i i i 

387.16 387.60 A: right 

388.26 390.91 B: tend to understand the reason behind now 

391.38 391.91 A: right 

391.40 393.35 B: but i would not know exactly 

393.72 395.41 B: what this topic would entail 

395.69 399.95 B: however one would say if this uh materials or rather books 

400.27 407.61 B: (( )) a negative impact on the development of the young people of the young children 

407.85 408.39 A: right 

408.41 414.97 B: then they should be banned and if the (( )) teachers the people (( )) the education cycle to see them first 

415.46 415.94 A: right 

416.91 423.78 B: but this does not mean that the others could not can not be informed for example the parents through the school board of control 

423.88 424.44 B: and others 

423.99 424.55 A: mhm 

425.04 426.02 B: (( )) 

426.96 434.80 A: no it's i i feel like it's more layered because i part of me wants to take into consideration the spirit into which the 

435.32 437.40 A: the piece was written um 

437.57 439.53 A: you know there's plenty of of 

440.30 443.01 A: um gratuitous sex and violence and 

443.36 444.68 A: language and 

444.80 447.06 A: what not (( rampant )) around 

447.16 450.17 A: this culture especially but um 

450.50 453.45 A: you can also find violence and language in 

453.97 455.62 A: sexual content that is 

455.89 458.43 A: in a spirit that provokes sort of a 

459.12 459.46 A: (( )) 

459.65 461.66 A: provokes discussion or growth 

461.77 462.89 A: or um 

464.28 466.75 A: just a b- a broader understanding of 

467.07 468.73 A: human life and and 

468.95 469.84 B: (( )) 

469.61 471.19 A: and and it's uh 

472.01 473.14 A: (( )) for 

473.37 477.51 A: a lot of people i think it's uh it's difficult to look past what 

477.80 478.85 A: you know may appear to 

479.28 481.72 A: to just be gratuitous to see if there is merit 

482.19 482.73 A: um 

483.25 484.29 A: and that's where 

484.73 488.27 A: the problem arises i mean the classic example within 

488.53 491.11 A: american culture is uh huckleberry finn 

491.61 494.21 A: and the derogatory um 

494.53 496.72 A: racial language that's in that book and it was 

497.18 499.36 A: banned for several years because of that yet 

500.07 504.50 A: if it's uh taught in the right way and presented in the right way it can really be a 

504.62 505.22 A: sort of a 

505.76 508.04 A: cultural bridge rather than um 

507.61 508.06 B: mhm 

508.34 509.59 A: a bridge burning so it's 

510.57 510.93 A: (( )) 

510.61 515.34 B: (( well if it is really true )) i think i agree with uh to a degree because um 

516.21 521.40 B: (( )) i mean you know education keeps on changing we are never on the same 

521.63 522.42 B: page 

522.65 524.83 B: uh with the generations you know 

522.78 523.20 A: right 

525.08 527.48 B: uh back ten years ago 

527.59 528.17 A: mhm 

528.04 531.18 B: uh so won't we be the same page with the 

531.37 532.10 B: generations 

532.21 533.13 B: ten years later 

533.54 534.37 B: so um 

534.10 534.64 A: mhm 

534.82 535.79 B: the issue 

535.91 538.24 B: er at hand probably would be 

538.80 540.52 B: the importance 

541.53 542.78 B: of these materials
