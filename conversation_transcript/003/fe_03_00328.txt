0.10 1.30 B: hello 

0.96 2.07 A: (( [noise] hello )) 

2.03 2.98 B: hi 

2.69 3.49 A: (( hi )) 

3.42 4.64 B: i'm danielle 

4.17 6.21 A: danielle i'm jeff how are you doing 

5.58 6.91 B: good how are you 

6.39 8.03 A: (( good )) 

8.60 10.60 B: i guess we just start talking about this 

10.21 11.53 A: (( just talk about perjury )) 

11.23 13.43 B: yeah [laughter] 

12.07 22.17 A: yeah actually my buddy was supposed to do this he told me it was going to be like on ah like a current topic like ah war in iraq or something like that but it kind of threw me off perjury okay 

21.34 22.60 B: [laughter] 

23.73 26.76 A: so where where are you ah calling from 

26.10 29.00 B: (( ah washington d._c. how about you )) 

27.39 29.88 A: okay well we're in phoenix 

29.56 31.72 B: oh really wow far away 

30.48 33.23 A: yeah yeah it it's nice it's nice 

34.76 39.07 B: so i guess the question is would you commit perjury for a 

39.39 41.61 B: a relative or close friend 

40.95 42.77 A: (( mhm )) 

43.98 45.77 A: what is it do you want me to start it off 

45.50 48.57 B: (( um oh well sure [laughter] it's so weird )) 

47.96 52.43 A: [laughter] it is kind of weird um how long are we supposed to talk do you know 

52.40 57.46 B: i think that they cut us off or i think it's supposed to be ten minutes and then they cut us off 

56.90 58.20 A: ten minutes okay 

58.28 59.10 A: okay 

59.61 60.63 A: (( hm )) 

60.77 63.98 A: well i think obviously it would probably depend on the situation if 

63.93 76.24 A: you're talking about you know something petty ah it kind of just depends on what the penalty's going to be i guess versus what the rewards are going to be i mean if you break it down rationally maybe if you're going to lie to you know 

70.42 72.74 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

77.18 82.92 A: save you know save your dad's job or maybe even save your dad's life you'd probably perje 

82.86 93.77 A: but maybe if it's something minor it probably wouldn't it probably wouldn't be worth it wouldn't be worth being dishonest it kind of i mean it kind of depends if you know kind of what your philosophy is 

83.07 84.29 B: [laughter] 

93.78 99.56 B: yeah i was thinking that it would it would depend on the circumstances like if you knew someone was innocent 

96.87 98.28 A: mhm 

99.26 101.03 A: mhm 

99.79 108.38 B: but they didn't have a good alibi maybe there's a lot of circumstantial evidence but you know for a fact that they're innocent would you lie in that circumstance 

103.67 105.50 A: (( mhm )) 

105.97 107.71 A: yeah 

107.81 109.63 A: mhm 

108.47 110.49 B: i think i might [laughter] 

109.66 121.07 A: yeah i think so too i think most people it would probably depend on the circumstance i i doubt there's too many people that would be you know just they have like a straight moral imperative to i'm never going to lie ever you know 

113.89 115.28 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

121.44 127.39 A: i think pr- with with everyone it'd have to depend on the situation quite a bit 

127.60 129.62 A: i would think 

128.65 142.51 B: yeah and i think that um it's people see it differently you're not lying for yourself you're not lying for your own benefit you're lying for someone else so i think it takes away the selfish aspect people feel more like they're doing something for someone else so it's not as bad [laughter] 

135.49 137.20 A: yeah 

137.79 139.67 A: mhm 

141.65 147.85 A: mhm i agree too it would kind of be seen as helping someone else even if it might be a detriment to a third party 

147.87 149.47 B: (( yeah )) 

148.01 152.70 A: i mean i i only know you know it's so kind of a broad question i don't know how you know 

152.74 157.51 B: yeah it really is i mean totally depends on you know how serious it is and what you know what 

158.95 160.65 A: mhm 

159.38 162.75 B: the circumstances are how you feel about that person and [laughter] 

161.22 164.04 A: yeah yeah a lot of a lot of different factors 

164.23 172.45 A: it yeah it'd be hard to say an absolute yes or no which i guess that's true in most things in life [laughter] there's a lot of grey areas 

169.43 170.93 B: yeah that's true 

173.18 174.16 A: (( hm )) 

174.03 179.40 B: we seem to agree so [laughter] so i don't know how we're going to talk about it for for ten minutes 

175.53 177.14 A: yeah 

178.81 179.58 A: (( ah )) 

180.24 182.77 A: is this from university of pennsylvania is this 

183.29 186.96 A: is this who set this up okay did you go to penn 

184.66 190.41 B: yeah no i didn't actually um i'm a grad student at george mason and 

189.75 190.81 A: oh really 

190.53 199.33 B: i got the um all the information from the linguistics department at george mason they sent round a an email to everybody and i just got it from that 

196.07 196.99 A: okay 

199.15 199.99 A: okay 

200.48 204.10 B: i guess they're sending around the country because you heard about it in phoenix [laughter] 

203.82 210.37 A: yeah yeah i my my buddy his mom [cough] speaks at a bunch of different schools and and she caught word of it somehow 

208.16 209.18 B: (( oh )) 

210.60 214.90 A: are you ah are you a linguistics grad student okay 

213.32 217.29 B: yeah i'm getting my masters in linguistics so 

215.25 216.66 A: [noise] wow 

217.93 221.06 A: i- linguistics has always seemed really interesting to me 

220.33 221.86 B: it really is 

221.28 225.45 A: i i didn't even hear about it until i ah hold on a second what 

226.74 237.64 A: i'm sorry um i didn't even hear about it until i started reaching cholmski of course linguistics is kind of not what he's really well known for but that's how i kind of came upon it and i'd read oh just 

227.37 228.42 B: that's okay 

231.31 233.25 B: mhm 

234.22 236.20 B: (( yeah )) 

237.61 242.45 A: a tiny bit of some of his linguistics stuff that was really interesting yeah 

239.82 241.08 B: oh really 

241.10 244.11 B: yeah he's hard to read i find him very difficult 

243.54 248.45 A: yeah do you do you ah ever ready his political stuff or more his linguistics stuff 

247.79 250.52 B: i have and i've only read his linguistics stuff 

249.92 251.63 A: yeah 

251.23 256.68 B: i heard all about his political things so he's pretty extreme [laughter] 

253.32 266.61 A: yeah yeah he's pretty i i agree with with him on quite a bit ah not everything but you know i'd say a lot but i remember just reading a i had like a cholmski reader which kind of summed up all of his political and linguistic things i think i 

265.95 267.95 B: oh really 

266.63 269.10 A: think when he was a grad student he ah 

269.37 283.31 A: he just did it when he was majoring in linguistics he did just a simple survey i think he asked five hundred people to you probably you might know about this just one question how are you today real generic and i think out of like five hundred answers there's only like two people that said the exact same thing 

282.78 285.71 B: oh really no i didn't i didn't hear about that 

283.39 293.09 A: yeah that's pretty amazing because you figure everyone no one's really going to say how they're really feeling most just say it's fine but even just staying fine only two people matched up so that's pretty amazing 

288.64 289.55 B: (( right )) 

292.55 294.06 B: oh that's interesting 

293.54 295.53 A: yeah yeah 

295.78 297.50 A: anyway the perjury 

297.66 298.93 B: [laughter] 

298.11 300.02 A: we're we're veering off i'm sorry 

299.19 301.47 B: yeah that's okay i 

302.08 304.72 B: i can't really think of too much more to say about it 

304.09 305.73 A: (( yeah i don't know if i do either )) 

305.34 308.37 B: (( i don't know if it has anything to do with bill clinton and his perjury )) 

307.96 319.05 A: yeah that could it could be you have to like someone who can debate the meaning of the word is you've got to you've got to admire that what do you mean what what is is what i- you know that's pretty incredible 

308.84 310.62 B: (( [laughter] )) 

312.78 316.10 B: yeah [laughter] yeah that's amazing 

316.47 317.95 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

319.72 321.25 B: very funny 

320.60 321.39 A: (( mm )) 

322.24 326.17 A: ah i can't really think of anything else to say about it really 

325.36 326.49 B: i know 

327.92 328.87 A: (( hm )) 

329.22 334.47 A: i guess you h- there's some obviously some philosophical stuff 

334.82 339.44 A: [sigh] but i mean it'd be kind of nothing we've alr- haven't said already 

339.09 343.01 B: you mean like a absolute morality in that situation that kind of 

341.37 343.81 A: [noise] yeah kind of like um 

344.36 346.98 A: well you're a grad student you've probably heard of kant haven't you 

347.31 361.35 A: yeah yeah you know about that it was just that absolute moral imperative and it's the only way you can ever really have any type of moral backbone is if you have a a you know a kind of a self rule i guess self paradigm only across the line but you i mean 

361.38 369.02 A: i who's going really do that like you know it's a if it's a loved one's job or life on the line no one's going to do that no one's going to do that [laughter] 

368.05 371.32 B: thing mhm yeah i don't know too many people who have that 

370.78 373.50 A: yeah i i don't i don't think i know any 

373.08 375.59 B: maybe they would never murder somebody but 

374.89 382.96 A: yeah yeah never ever yeah yeah i don't know anyone like that [mn] so 

384.13 385.55 A: [sigh] hm 

386.06 387.32 A: but then i guess you could 

386.28 395.47 B: but i guess there are you know a whole core system is sort of based on you can't you can't just have absolutes you have to have um you know different punishments for different people and different 

392.04 393.48 A: yeah 

395.89 396.81 A: yeah 

397.21 398.93 B: (( circumstances and they sort of acknowledge )) 

399.30 405.14 A: mhm yeah the really only place you find absolutes kind of fundamental religion usually and [mn] 

403.21 404.51 B: (( you can't have that )) 

405.51 408.05 A: we've seen what that can do [laughter] 

408.61 411.40 A: so yeah um 

412.45 420.41 A: yeah and i guess you could think about i don't know just u- utilitarianism and i mean even even if you're doing something that's perceived as wrong 

420.81 428.49 A: is it really wrong if it helps out a lot of people you know how do you how do you even gauge it really it's tough to do 

423.27 424.60 B: (( absolute yeah )) 

430.89 438.65 A: since we don't know each other have you every purged anything oh not purged i guess that means throwing up have you ever committed perjury 

435.61 441.50 B: [laughter] yeah mhm [laughter] no i've never testified in court so 

441.21 446.27 A: oh this is in court oh okay yeah you know i mean i i think i 

442.34 443.25 B: yeah 

445.51 447.61 B: i think that's what i think that's what they're 

447.43 451.14 A: in court yeah i know i've ah signed my parents' name on a few report cards 

450.40 453.49 B: asking oh well [laughter] [laughter] 

451.52 452.79 A: throughout the years 

453.38 456.38 A: who hasn't though right 

454.56 455.94 B: yeah 

456.77 458.40 B: (( [laughter] i )) 

457.98 458.98 A: um 

460.31 462.11 A: yeah i yeah i've never been in 

462.13 463.76 A: never been in court either 

463.95 469.25 B: guess i've never really had the opportunity to test my ah willpower there and [laughter] 

467.29 471.88 A: yeah you never know you never know until you're up up against it 

472.27 474.80 A: [sigh] i know i have a job um 

474.83 475.97 A: where 

476.55 482.01 A: ah we get it's such a boring job we get all this paperwork and sometimes if they don't have a 

482.10 487.74 A: a correct way of dating it you have to send it back to them you're not allowed to change any of the records 

487.35 488.70 B: oh really 

487.73 495.78 A: and i know i'm still in training but i've seen [laughter] i've seen my boss [laughter] just kind of look around make a few slashes a few 

495.55 505.99 A: a few eights into sixes and a few twos into sevens and and that i mean morally i don't really think that's a big deal but i just maybe company policy i don't know 

496.29 498.89 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

506.17 509.50 B: it's hard to stand up for a lot of company policy 

508.96 511.54 A: oh yeah and half of it i mean 

511.83 518.56 A: oh yeah yeah it's [laughter] no one you know what i mean you don't care about it i mean it just it's b._s. anyway 

513.93 514.83 B: [laughter] 

518.77 521.54 A: other policy so you really don't feel bad lying to them 

520.98 526.50 B: yeah exactly [laughter] it's not really lying when you lie to your boss [laughter] 

521.56 522.23 A: (( you )) 

522.44 524.01 A: feel kind of good really 

524.75 528.30 A: yeah if you're going to b._s. me i'm going to b._s. you right back 

527.66 529.08 B: exactly 

528.78 530.43 A: mhm 

530.79 531.71 B: [laughter] 

531.63 535.91 A: no well i don't know how much more there is to say really 

535.75 537.59 B: i think it's been ten minutes 

537.23 538.37 A: has it been 

538.05 543.81 B: (( yeah i don't know if they're going to cut us off or what i think we're supposed to talk all the way until they do or )) 

538.44 539.78 A: i don't even know oh 

540.42 541.31 A: okay 

542.97 547.42 A: yeah i wondered that are we supposed to talk until they cut us off like for instructions or 

548.35 552.18 B: i mean it's been i think it's been a full ten minutes i was looking at my watch 

551.75 560.80 A: okay well let's talk just like for a few more minutes and if they haven't cut us off we can just go and hang up i guess we could do that where'd you ah where'd you go to undergrad at 

553.60 555.03 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

559.70 562.33 B: actually the same place [laughter] strangely enough 

560.84 561.74 A: okay 

562.13 563.06 A: (( you what )) 

562.91 565.81 B: strangely enough i went to the same school for undergrad 

565.17 567.36 A: where you from d._c. area growing up 

566.77 571.22 B: yeah and i just i actually was living here after i graduated and 

571.23 578.41 B: just um they had a program i wanted so i just i kind of wanted to go to a different school but that didn't make sense when they had what i wanted 

577.95 579.47 A: yeah 

578.94 582.72 B: it's a state school so [sigh] affordable [laughter] 

582.29 586.53 A: [laughter] mm what was your was your undergrad linguistics 

586.66 590.48 B: ah no actually my undergrad was in ah english composition 

590.01 590.98 A: okay 

591.48 593.24 A: so you you're a good writer huh 

591.49 592.64 B: (( how about you )) 

592.92 595.37 B: well i mean i try [laughter] 

596.95 599.01 A: yeah um 

599.09 600.60 A: do you have to ah 

601.26 602.08 A: you don't 

602.39 605.49 A: you don't have to get anything published do you when you did this undergrad 

605.28 606.79 B: (( oh no mm-mm no lucky lucky )) 

605.69 608.13 A: english okay i didn't think so 

608.48 609.22 A: (( oh )) 

609.78 610.65 B: for me 

610.24 612.89 A: do you have to get something published in grad school 

612.76 618.57 B: [laughter] i think it depends on if you are getting an m. s. a. you might for that i don't know 

616.15 617.07 A: okay 

618.52 619.40 A: okay 

619.75 622.77 A: yeah i'm going to i'm going to grad school 

622.87 626.73 A: ah next fall for for political science so 

624.31 625.59 B: oh good 

626.02 627.35 B: oh great 

626.87 628.90 A: so yeah 

628.51 630.71 B: so these questions are right up your alley 

630.23 638.68 A: yeah they are i i w- i was i was hoping for more like a kind of like a i don't know global affair you know local affair type thing but 

637.94 639.17 B: yeah 

639.06 640.06 A: that's fine 

639.76 641.81 B: [laughter] 

640.36 642.46 A: perjury's perjury's fine i guess 

642.03 645.78 B: it's not a very you can't really say a whole lot about it the whole thing 

645.12 646.79 A: yeah i i mean 

647.12 653.28 A: i guess linguistically no one would have the same words but i mean i think everyone would have pretty much the same get the same point across 

652.97 657.83 B: yeah i was wondering what the ah point of this ah what they're what they're trying to find out with the 

657.42 658.50 A: yeah 

657.87 669.04 B: like i have a feeling it has something to do with how you speak in certain situations and not necessarily what you're talking about like a topic but i don't know i mean i'd be interested to find out the results of the study mhm 

663.37 664.53 A: yeah that's 

668.02 671.15 A: yeah that's true it would be interesting 

671.40 677.72 A: like linguistics isn't like su- i mean is it just like super technical like diagrams 

677.34 682.46 B: yeah it's a lot of that syntax i really like phonology it's really interesting 

681.90 683.48 A: (( and w- what's that )) 

683.19 690.93 B: you study the um the sounds of different languages how how different sounds go together and form different languages it's really interesting 

686.38 687.23 A: huh 

688.12 689.17 A: really 

690.60 692.10 A: (( hm )) 

691.14 695.17 B: especially when you study english and you have no idea how complicated 

695.22 696.29 B: (( is )) 

695.68 701.78 A: yeah tha- that's what i've heard english i- is one of the hardest languages to learn it's very complicated 

699.98 705.03 B: it's just like these things that you have this knowledge that you have that you don't realise you have it's amazing 

704.71 709.34 A: yeah that's incredible have you studied the vietnamese language at all 

709.32 710.73 B: (( no mm-mm )) 

710.80 714.31 B: not not specifically we study different languages 

710.81 711.58 A: my 

714.38 718.43 B: like we do different phonology projects and how they how they work 

716.48 718.15 A: yeah 

718.45 719.36 A: huh
