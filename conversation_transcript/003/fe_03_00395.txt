45.76 48.52 B: you go first cause i think you know more about it then me 

48.22 54.64 A: well yeah i mean when they first said foreign relations i first said what are they talking about cause that's a pretty 

54.34 55.47 B: yeah yeah 

55.09 56.53 A: pretty broad spectrum 

57.20 65.20 A: i mean not you know the number one thing that would come up in anybody's mind when we talk about somebody who's a threat to us has probably got to be iraq you know that's 

65.30 65.69 B: yeah 

65.97 67.90 A: that's kind of the whole central focus of 

67.19 69.89 B: iraq korea who else maybe 

70.37 70.98 A: uh 

71.09 73.63 A: possibly china maybe 

73.75 75.22 A: you know i 

74.18 75.41 B: in a long time yeah 

75.55 75.93 B: yeah 

75.99 78.39 A: yeah it's long term your right not real 

79.07 82.82 A: maybe not a real immediate thing just something we kind of 

82.95 86.42 A: keep our eyes and ears open for uh 

87.26 93.14 A: i don't i guess where ever the terrorist groups are afghanistan i heard possibly somalia 

93.40 97.17 B: i think pakistan if they if somebody takes over that country we could have big problems 

97.28 98.34 A: yeah yeah 

97.97 101.50 B: yeah i mean that guy is he's in there by force 

102.19 105.66 B: and you know he's liable to get blown away one of these days then what happens 

105.33 105.95 A: yeah 

106.43 107.04 B: uh 

107.57 109.98 B: but uh i figure we've got enough to do right now 

110.21 112.50 A: yeah we got a lot going on right now 

110.57 111.22 B: other than that 

112.02 113.06 B: good you know 

113.23 114.82 A: yeah iraq's got to be the 

115.08 125.06 A: the number one and i thing i guess that's the debate right now i don't know i don't know people ask me all the time you know what do you think about you know 

125.33 130.91 A: i mean obviously i do what i'm told and i joined the military for a reason so 

128.37 128.66 B: yeah 

131.05 133.04 A: it doesn't really matter what i think 

133.16 133.65 A: um 

133.22 133.64 B: uh-huh 

133.94 134.63 B: how long you been in 

134.80 136.39 A: uh going on ten years 

136.36 137.34 B: oh wow okay 

137.38 147.95 A: yeah so you know i've got my reservations too i mean it's i can't remember anytime we just decided to go against the united nations and just 

146.26 146.83 B: yeah 

147.25 147.69 B: yeah 

148.18 149.52 A: you know which is really what it 

149.67 153.45 A: it i i i'm not going to say it's not what it's coming too 

153.55 154.32 A: um 

154.19 159.36 B: oh sure i agree with you the u._n.'s going to want us falling around and we're going to want to go in 

159.28 161.60 A: yeah well the thing is if we go in 

161.86 168.72 A: we got to go in uh you know the reason why the president is moving all the troops and stuff is that um he 

168.87 175.35 A: if we wait to long uh we can't do it we can't wait until the summer time when it's you know well over a hundred degrees 

175.28 175.73 B: mm 

175.76 179.87 A: you know the equipment doesn't work as well the soldiers don't perform as well 

179.00 181.56 B: about to say the poor soldiers you know that's tuff 

180.95 181.64 A: yeah 

189.75 190.43 B: that's tuff 

191.51 192.34 B: yup yup 

191.89 194.65 A: you know course they'd get sun burns anyway but 

195.47 201.64 A: uh so if it's going to happen it's got to happen soon or it's got to wait for another year or the year after that 

200.49 201.22 B: mm 

201.35 202.04 B: um i agree with you 

202.15 203.60 B: yup i agree with you 

202.57 203.27 A: you know 

204.24 206.76 B: i could see i think he's going to go in by the middle of march 

207.36 207.94 A: yeah 

207.55 208.65 B: uh you know 

214.89 217.03 B: either pictures or intelligence or something 

217.65 220.98 B: that says hey we know for a fact he's got this and this buried here 

221.31 221.72 A: yeah 

228.92 231.62 B: he made a comment he think that the irqis 

232.08 234.28 B: have hidden a lot of their stuff over in syria 

234.63 234.99 A: uh 

235.17 236.39 B: which is right next door to him 

236.89 240.99 B: you know he think he's actually moved a lot of their stuff out to syria and we ain't looking in syria 

241.45 242.85 B: and we're busy looking in iraq 

242.84 243.33 A: yeah 

243.45 250.50 B: then again i'm thinking well how do you move stuff like that with a spot you know i'm presuming that satellites up there twenty four seven 

251.04 252.31 B: uh look a look a look a 

252.65 253.09 A: yeah 

253.21 253.83 B: so uh 

254.49 259.40 A: yeah it's kind of interesting i get kind of conflicting reports just from watching the news i 

258.95 259.77 B: oh god yeah 

259.84 261.46 A: you know i really don't know 

261.58 268.17 A: you honestly anymore than anybody else who watches this news would know what's going on over there but one day i here 

264.02 264.51 B: mm 

268.44 272.41 A: i read a story the other day that the inspectors are allowed 

272.73 276.92 A: to take the scientists that work in iraq there allowed to take them 

277.12 279.61 A: and their families out side of the country 

279.73 280.75 A: to interview them 

281.35 282.54 B: supposedly yeah 

281.39 282.84 A: if they so desire 

283.28 285.61 A: but they haven't done that and i guess one of the 

285.75 293.82 A: you know the spokes person uh one of the spokes men for the inspectors said that they weren't in the business of kidnapping 

294.20 295.01 A: in 

304.79 307.94 B: uh you know one of them talks you your going to find pieces of that family 

308.10 309.19 A: yeah that's true 

308.63 309.72 B: uh just 

309.89 310.39 B: (( )) 

310.50 313.85 B: terribly uh wiped out none of them are going to say shit 

313.97 314.47 A: yeah 

314.43 315.56 B: they aren't going to say boo 

315.82 319.08 A: yup i don't i don't really excuse me 

319.50 324.81 A: i don't really expect them to fin anything i'd be shocked if they did 

323.44 323.93 B: yeah 

325.24 327.83 A: i would also be shocked if we went in 

328.05 336.69 A: and we didn't find anything ether i think if we went in and if we go in again we're not making the same mistake the first president bush did we're not stopping we're 

329.85 330.32 B: yeah 

336.33 338.80 B: oh yeah when we get done it's going to be done 

336.94 343.28 A: we're taking over the country and we're going to turn over every rock and we're going to find every thing that they've got 

343.63 346.16 B: i think even if we didn't find something we'll say we found something 

346.34 349.03 A: yeah we probably will 

347.56 348.01 B: yeah 

348.63 349.66 B: i mean that 

349.79 358.30 B: we just you know hey new tip can't but too close because of the deadly poison gas but it's bad stuff in there weather they do find it or not 

355.32 355.81 A: yeah 

358.70 366.59 A: yeah that's the biggest thing that scares me is the treat of that you know poison gas or any sort of chemical weapons they may have over there 

363.90 364.18 B: yup 

367.11 370.41 B: yeah funny sides there interested manly our voices right

458.37 464.09 A: yeah i can't say i've done that myself but i can say that doesn't surprise me there are certain 

458.48 459.24 B: (( icor )) 

463.25 464.57 B: yeah sure you know 

464.20 467.92 A: there are certain item where if you want a new one you better have an old one 

468.55 473.35 A: you can't just buy a new one you can trade in your old one that doesn't work that's just a hunk of junk 

468.66 468.91 B: yeah 

470.03 470.30 B: yup 

472.95 475.80 B: all right so you heard this kind of stuff that's exactly what went on 

474.65 475.08 A: oh 

475.80 476.28 A: yeah 

476.67 480.44 B: i mean he didn't call he cared was that there was a plug on the end i recall 

479.99 480.49 A: wow 

480.54 486.70 B: care if you don't even want to plug that thing in the wall may blow up the secrete he says oh you know i don't care i'm not going to 

486.93 493.72 B: this guy some kind he might have been a captain as a matter of fact he brought a couple of warm bodies to help him move them thing cause they was heavy 

493.45 493.89 A: wow 

493.81 497.35 B: what the that's what i call a true win win situation 

497.55 498.31 B: oh uh 

498.71 502.43 A: yeah i'm not sure exactly what they are studying you said they're interested in our voices 

502.94 503.89 B: i think so yeah 

504.47 505.94 A: i couldn't imagine their 

506.47 510.31 A: i i assuming they just give the topics to give people something to talk about 

509.77 511.12 B: that's exactly right yeah 

510.95 511.35 A: yeah 

511.87 512.23 B: yeah 

511.89 513.94 A: i couldn't image they're analyzing our 

514.10 515.08 A: break down of the 

515.20 516.41 A: the you know 

515.92 521.72 B: they could be they could be doing it for a couple of reasons have you ever read anything on how they do voice stuff 

521.86 522.73 A: no i sure haven't' 

522.83 528.70 B: it's it's fairly impressive aside from them taking your voices and digitizing them 

529.35 531.76 B: part of the way they make the voice stuff work 

532.49 534.83 B: is that they're trying to figure out the usage pattern 

535.47 537.54 B: cause you know american english has got 

537.70 540.81 B: the same word could be you know four different things 

541.31 542.41 B: you know the word to 

542.78 544.94 B: could be the number could be too many 

545.07 547.09 B: or it could just be i'm going to the store 

547.34 547.67 A: mm 

547.89 552.45 B: and i think what they are doing probably to pick up 

552.55 553.27 B: ah 

553.67 555.02 B: how people use words 

555.88 556.25 A: yeah 

556.31 556.81 B: uh 

557.39 562.10 B: i don't really they didn't say did you get it from new group 

562.11 564.98 A: actually a friend of mine sent it to me 

568.62 574.15 B: and i first i was a little suspicious then i saw university of pennsylvania so i said hey why not 

574.17 575.34 A: ye that's what i said 

574.67 578.84 B: yeah let me let me now you've got a fairly lousy phone connection from my point of view 

579.67 581.24 B: i mean it sounds a little raspy 

581.41 581.84 A: really 

581.86 582.70 B: uh 

583.19 587.09 B: you thinks that's normal or it just happens to be because we're going through their computer or something like that 

587.18 588.07 A: yeah could be 

588.22 590.82 B: okay how do i sound to you in terms of a 

591.11 591.62 B: sound 

591.68 592.73 A: yeah you sound pretty good 

592.68 597.15 B: okay okay when i wrote into them i grew up in new york city 

597.36 599.95 B: i went to school in brooklyn and stuff like that so what you hearing 

599.07 599.66 A: oh really
