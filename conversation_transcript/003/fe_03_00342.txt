165.30 165.92 A: right 

166.09 166.57 A: yeah

194.35 196.22 A: eventually no i i didn't 

196.77 198.78 A: so i came to here 

198.13 200.64 B: that's amazing then what do you go to school for then 

201.29 204.40 A: uh i study master of business 

204.51 207.59 A: management of business administration here 

207.08 209.36 B: well then you should start a business then 

209.83 211.70 B: oh 

210.02 214.73 A: oh so money is an issue for me so no is a hypothetical 

215.13 216.75 A: so how about you 

216.63 217.22 B: um 

217.63 226.35 B: well i was thinking about that as the the automated you know response person was saying it and i was like oh man there's so many things i would do if money wasn't an issue 

226.86 229.51 B: and my husband and i have talked before about um 

230.09 230.61 B: opening 

230.81 233.73 B: this sounds very funny but motorcycle training schools 

234.11 236.13 A: motorcycle training school 

235.14 242.93 B: yes because um in the united states and and i don't know if it's all over the united states but in wisconsin there's a shortage of schools to teach people how to drive motorcycles 

243.28 244.30 A: oh okay 

243.51 248.23 B: and so i took a course a couple years back and it took me almost four semesters to get the course 

248.67 249.41 A: wow 

248.86 255.85 B: you go on a big waiting list and he's very he he knows a lot about motorcycles he's been racing and he could 

256.06 263.11 B: teach potentially if we had the property it would be very lucrative i don't know if it would make me happy but it 

257.82 258.56 A: wow 

260.74 261.31 A: wow 

263.27 265.46 B: i'm in school for psychology and i think that may be 

266.00 266.66 A: oh 

266.46 268.17 B: if i started my own business it might be like uh 

268.34 269.51 B: a private practice 

270.06 275.90 A: oh so you both you and your husband kind of outdoor person you like sports very much huh 

275.60 279.51 B: well a little bit motorcycles yes some stuff yes some stuff no

285.84 286.75 B: it is 

286.91 287.47 A: yeah 

287.21 288.01 B: and i think that 

288.19 289.18 B: i think i would be a 

291.24 293.98 B: although i'm sure i have a lot to learn i think that 

293.60 294.21 A: mhm 

294.52 297.33 B: i'd i'd well in the business capacity
