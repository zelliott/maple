352.04 354.18 A: i don't know if i really have a favorite what about you

364.30 364.62 B: (( ew )) 

365.33 365.72 B: yeah 

365.86 367.33 B: (( )) i i guess um 

367.43 371.80 B: so what do you think about like professional sports in general and like their pay and all the like 

371.81 374.36 A: yeah it's kind of interesting um 

373.63 374.04 B: mhm 

374.68 384.75 A: they yeah it's kind of frustrating sometimes to think man their just playing a game and their getting paid millions you know um and yeah it's 

380.66 381.17 B: right 

382.68 383.52 B: right 

384.92 391.36 A: you know it's really hard to get there whatever but yeah i am i'm not in th- i'm not so sure about the whole 

391.83 392.64 A: just 

392.79 393.52 A: um 

393.83 403.48 A: how it's so commercialized now you know like the world series behind the play is this big blue screen that they can put up you know a uh 

395.77 396.20 B: right 

403.69 406.93 A: an advertisement for your area or whatever and it's just 

405.98 406.50 B: right 

407.02 409.79 A: so advertised that gets kind of 

410.51 421.47 A: you know a pay everything every uniform you know is uh has a name or every field has you know coors field or whatever but i mean i'm not like totally against it like it 

416.25 416.71 B: right 

417.94 418.42 B: mhm 

421.68 423.43 A: really bugs me but 

423.14 423.39 B: right 

423.69 427.84 A: i think it's really over commercialized 

426.57 427.62 B: it definitely is 

427.72 430.97 B: i agree with that mhm and there's just like way too much like 

431.17 434.09 B: sometimes i'm like how can you guys complain 

433.39 436.25 A: oh i know about their money or whatever mhm 

434.89 436.09 B: yeah yeah 

436.58 437.32 B: yeah i mean 

437.59 442.55 B: eh so what do you think about michael jordan going back too talking about basketball 

440.40 441.37 A: yeah 

442.27 446.98 A: i don't know it was kind of i mean he's definitely not the player he used to be i think it was 

447.85 449.78 A: really just because he loves the game 

449.75 450.21 B: mhm 

450.18 451.50 A: you know and so 

450.81 451.22 B: mhm 

451.63 457.35 A: i don't know it was just weird because like it eh he's kind of like a different person now like 

457.58 464.21 A: michael jordan's name will always live on but it's kind of like you don't think of him as he is now 

460.62 461.06 B: right 

463.90 464.41 B: right 

464.37 465.65 A: you know so 

465.78 468.91 A: yes i don't know i never really followed him or 

469.42 472.53 A: anything after that glory days are kind of over 

472.13 472.66 B: right 

472.69 476.34 A: but i don't know what do you think about that 

475.94 478.37 B: i thought it was a bad move on his part 

478.01 478.74 A: yeah 

479.10 479.83 B: yeah i 

479.15 481.72 A: it kind of ru- well li- it kind of ruined his name i don't know 

481.20 481.69 B: right 

481.91 484.67 B: it was kind of like you should be done now 

483.88 484.86 A: yeah 

485.25 485.94 B: you know it's just 

486.79 488.48 B: when it's over it's over 

488.36 489.02 A: yeah 

489.49 490.29 B: so 

490.00 492.38 A: yeah go out with a bang and leave it at that 

492.13 492.77 B: right 

493.45 494.38 A: but 

495.18 495.47 B: so 

496.74 497.53 B: well that's cool 

496.76 497.40 A: yeah 

498.66 501.53 A: so yeah i'm trying to think of some more questions 

502.36 505.29 A: um 

506.60 510.49 A: so what do you think about like ticket prices 

509.82 512.48 B: i don't see i don't really go to any games 

511.97 515.22 A: yeah i don't either really 

514.16 518.44 B: but i mean out here a lot of people are like season ticket holders for the 

518.72 522.51 B: packers and stuff like that so it's really hard to get tickets 

519.33 520.22 A: yeah 

522.26 523.14 A: oh i bet 

523.35 530.59 B: um but yeah and they just like their prices just went up because they just like you know they're re-doing the field and 

530.21 530.80 A: right 

530.75 535.41 B: just all this stuff so i mean i'm sure a lot of people who go to the games 

535.63 538.81 B: um the experience is probably worth it for them 

538.79 539.56 A: right 

539.18 545.08 B: but i think i don't go because i don't think that i'd want to pay those kind of prices 

540.73 541.29 A: yeah 

544.03 545.29 A: right yeah 

545.52 546.78 A: espec- yeah exactly 

546.95 553.10 B: if there's enough like money generated period with everything else what's left for ticket prices 

549.20 549.88 A: mhm 

550.98 551.78 A: yeah 

553.26 557.40 A: there was one thing that well you know the the strike for the world series 

561.80 562.65 B: right 

563.73 564.19 B: mhm 

564.22 565.34 A: and you i thought that was
