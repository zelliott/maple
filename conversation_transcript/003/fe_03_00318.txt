40.66 42.56 A: oh yes mhm 

44.15 48.41 A: okay um so the topic is drawing the line between 

49.81 50.62 B: ah 

49.83 53.77 A: acceptable comedy and comedy in poor taste 

53.43 54.63 B: yeah 

54.07 55.75 A: (( do you have any thoughts on that )) 

55.70 56.89 B: um 

57.86 61.99 B: [mn] i think yeah it's a really it's a tough issue i think 

60.75 61.79 A: mhm 

62.13 68.27 B: because i there's so many different opinions as to what's offensive and what's not 

67.98 68.93 A: right 

69.38 70.17 B: (( so )) 

69.79 73.08 A: i mean maybe it's [cough] very individual 

73.03 74.09 B: mhm 

73.18 74.16 A: um 

74.81 78.58 A: i mean i'm not sure what comedy in poor taste is do you 

78.87 81.20 A: what does that mean poor taste 

81.54 91.55 B: i don't know i i think i mean i think you're right it's it's completely individual and something i might think is in poor taste somebody else might think is 

91.68 95.41 B: very funny and and completely acceptable 

92.82 93.79 A: mhm 

94.95 95.93 A: mhm 

96.18 100.95 A: well are there like certain comedians you love and certain comedians you hate 

101.71 102.77 B: um 

102.86 113.12 B: yeah it's funny you know i there are a couple of comedians that i think are really funny like i i actually i really like um robin williams and george carlin 

112.80 113.80 A: mhm 

113.43 126.00 B: but at times you know especially george carlin you know some things i think he says are over the top and and bordering you know offensive or th- you know something like that but 

123.71 124.64 A: mhm 

126.01 132.16 B: at the same time i can still find the things that i find are funny in what he says and 

132.23 134.11 B: you know usually 

134.89 141.69 B: i- i don't usually take offense to the things he says i just accept them as him his opinion and or 

140.68 141.45 A: (( mhm )) 

143.02 145.85 B: you know maybe that other people find them funny 

145.78 158.31 A: oh yeah i mean like i remember i you sound to me young i don't know if you are but you sound to me younger than i am and i remember george carlin when he started out and he was absolutely hilarious and he didn't do 

157.13 158.36 B: mhm 

158.19 161.53 A: he didn't do any like political comedy 

161.88 164.57 A: um and i think as he's gotten older 

164.69 166.66 A: he's gotten into more 

166.59 170.15 A: um like like you said telling his opinion 

170.01 171.08 B: mhm 

170.04 181.92 A: [laughter] which is not something he started out doing and i agree with you i don't like it when he does that but i love robin williams anything robin williams does i think is funny 

171.25 172.33 B: yeah 

177.09 177.90 B: mhm 

181.33 186.09 B: oh i know he's so funny he's just so he's brilliant [laughter] 

185.33 186.30 A: (( [laughter] i know )) 

186.61 187.92 A: [laughter] but 

187.34 193.51 B: is there um humor that you find any comedians you find offensive or any humor your find offensive 

192.83 201.93 A: well i i think i think actually you may have put your finger on what i get upset about which is when comedians use comedy 

202.03 207.41 A: to to um as a kind of a political platform for themselves 

207.13 208.00 B: mm 

207.51 221.67 A: so i think that's why i have trouble with bill maher for instance because i don't really think everything he says is funny i think he's he's just always trying to tell everybody what he thinks about this and what he thinks about that 

221.32 222.92 B: mm mhm 

221.94 231.05 A: i- not in a funny way but in a you know in a straightforward way or something like that i don't mind satire i love satire if it's well done 

226.69 227.64 B: mhm 

229.35 230.41 B: yeah 

231.34 234.58 A: um but i think that that's 

235.04 236.19 A: that's 

236.49 241.43 A: i i guess that's the challenge for a comedian is to 

241.52 245.74 A: um say something funny about something serious 

245.75 252.56 A: without sort of um breaking the frame and sort of talking in his own voice or something like that 

251.75 253.55 B: mhm right right 

252.71 253.52 A: yeah 

254.14 255.70 A: so um 

255.71 257.40 B: what do you do in maine 

257.37 261.29 A: i'm a college professor and i have an e._s._l. background actually 

258.94 259.76 B: (( oh ))

275.03 276.02 A: mhm 

276.53 281.64 B: i've considered you know thinking about going going to penn for the 

281.80 283.54 B: in order to get a degree 

282.99 283.75 A: mhm 

283.67 289.22 B: um i haven't quite decided yet i think i need to talk to some more of the teachers 

288.93 290.45 A: it's a very good school 

290.48 292.71 B: (( yeah yeah that's what i hear )) 

292.15 294.39 A: yeah and actually there's someone 

294.48 296.97 A: here who's a graduate from um 

297.78 301.44 A: from penn linguistics in our linguistics program 

301.34 302.18 B: mm 

302.34 303.95 A: ah teaching so 

303.77 305.17 B: oh great 

304.28 306.13 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

305.58 306.38 B: (( mm )) 

306.49 309.96 B: i think it's i mean it's interesting too when you bring in um 

310.43 314.61 B: when when you think about this topic in terms of international students 

312.38 313.39 A: mhm 

314.21 316.08 A: yes oh yeah 

314.74 315.78 B: (( and um )) 

316.03 322.67 B: you know it's kind of it's very you know you bring in the idea of culture and what's funny in one culture is 

322.81 325.91 B: may not be at all in another and 

326.27 329.52 B: i always fi- i find that just very interesting 

329.02 336.03 A: mhm if i a long time ago i went to colombia university to observe [cough] 

336.07 337.92 A: an e._s._l. class 

338.38 348.78 A: and the teacher did a very interesting exercise that i think i tried once but you have to have a class of students from all different countries 

348.99 352.04 A: they can't all be from like the same country or something 

351.09 353.10 B: (( mm mhm )) 

352.07 354.80 A: and she put them into pairs 

355.08 359.44 A: um where each one in the pair was from a different country 

359.65 361.14 A: and she told them 

361.74 366.69 A: for each person to tell the other what the comic stereotype 

366.71 370.27 A: of their nationality is in their culture 

370.06 371.75 B: oh interesting 

371.06 380.17 A: which was hilarious [laughter] the like you know french people were telling germans what the comic german stereotype was in france 

372.38 373.61 B: [laughter] 

379.81 380.82 B: uh-huh 

380.21 384.24 A: and then vice versa and the students were all like 

384.80 392.23 A: oh that's not true and that's exaggerated and and they had a they [cough] they actually had fun with um 

385.22 386.68 B: [laughter] 

392.23 404.69 A: with this and it was it was kind of both funny and culturally informing and um and it also gave everybody a chance to defend their own national comical stereotype 

397.99 399.14 B: mhm 

405.00 408.21 A: and i thought yeah i thought it was a great exercise 

405.15 406.01 B: oh that's 

407.52 409.83 B: that sounds yeah that sounds really fun 

409.30 410.84 A: [laughter] 

410.89 414.17 B: might be something i should suggest to the teachers here 

413.33 415.14 A: [laughter] 

414.26 418.16 B: like a fun activity but yeah interesting yeah 

415.67 416.80 A: right 

417.29 431.36 A: and i don't think anybody took offence you know i mean i think that because it was set up to be you know well this isn't you know how your nationality really is it's it's the comic stereotype of your nationality or something like that 

420.01 421.06 B: mhm 

427.40 428.50 B: right 

430.14 432.05 B: right right 

431.69 433.86 A: yeah i thought that was very good 

433.62 435.63 B: that's funny yeah 

434.64 440.77 A: and like have you been abroa- i've been abroad and there are these comic stereotypes of americans too 

440.13 446.10 B: oh definitely yeah i lived in um in costa rica for a couple of years and ah 

444.27 445.22 A: uh-huh 

446.29 450.55 B: the the stereotypes of people from the u._s. and 

451.26 460.58 B: it's really interesting i mean there are some that you know are obvious but others you know i never would have thought of until i talked you know i made friends down there and talked to them and 

459.77 462.10 A: so what was some of them in costa rica 

462.04 463.04 B: (( um )) 

463.17 463.95 A: (( [cough] )) 

463.79 470.38 B: well some of them you know some of them are just sort of the the loud talking u._s. tourist who 

469.52 470.47 A: mhm 

470.49 472.62 B: you know goes down there and 

472.65 477.89 B: is very is very loud and ah not subtle at all [laughter] 

477.38 478.81 A: right 

478.28 482.71 B: and there's um a funny one with the cab drivers that um 

483.28 484.19 B: this is 

484.86 491.59 B: kind of different but you know everyone up here has very heavy car doors and down there the cars are lot lighter so 

490.97 491.97 A: mhm 

491.68 496.31 B: you know any time a a u._s. tourist gets into a cab down there the cab drivers 

496.26 510.39 B: does these signs posted in english don't slam your doors and sometimes the cab driver will actually get out even if even if they they have no idea if you're going to slam the door or not but they'll still get out of their cab to open and shut the door for you 

499.49 500.64 A: [laughter] 

506.55 507.47 A: mhm 

509.90 512.02 A: [laughter] oh that's funny 

510.49 511.32 B: [laughter] 

511.53 513.10 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

513.45 516.15 B: have you run into any stereotypes

517.67 519.05 B: oh wow 

518.12 527.73 A: [cough] and there they they have a number of comic stereotypes one being that americans are sort of stupid and easily fooled 

527.17 529.14 B: oh interesting 

528.64 542.73 A: um that that and and speaking of cab drivers you know that cab drivers can easily fool a tourist you know in terms of driving them around or you know um asking for more money than they deserve 

535.93 536.97 B: uh-huh 

539.36 540.79 B: right 

542.58 548.73 A: but in general i think the the the attitude towards is americans is that they're naive 

542.63 543.76 B: mhm 

548.68 549.52 B: mm 

548.94 556.12 A: and that you can you can get what you want out of them everything from money to sexual favors 

556.04 556.93 B: uh-huh

654.54 656.67 B: there there is there's um 

656.96 670.22 B: there's actu- there's a real strong philadelphian accent um among certain parts of philadelphia and ah there's actually a book it was called something illy phonetics or something 

660.78 661.61 A: mhm
