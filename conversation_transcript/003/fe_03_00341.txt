27.76 28.80 B: speech a business 

29.48 34.10 B: as a speech language pathologist it's funny i imagined a business would mean 

34.68 35.31 B: selling things 

36.06 40.91 A: well it could but it would be more it's a health related field 

41.49 44.62 A: so it's be like opening your own doctors office 

44.72 45.15 A: or 

45.90 48.52 A: um clinic basically what it would be 

49.17 51.44 B: what kind of pathologies would you sell 

52.63 53.41 A: um 

53.09 55.11 B: would you treat i would guess 

53.66 57.72 A: um well i would specialize 

58.10 61.63 A: right now i have friends that work with a lot of autistic children 

61.91 65.30 A: um usually birth to three types of 

66.16 66.92 A: um 

67.36 71.93 A: which feeding issues kids who aren't speaking um i've 

72.99 75.58 A: experience so lots of different things 

75.93 76.42 B: uh-huh 

76.60 78.86 B: so excuse me autistic kids 

79.43 81.06 B: would come to you in your 

81.55 84.93 B: practice and you would try and help them 

86.50 87.39 A: learn to communicate 

87.37 88.52 B: learn to communicate 

88.44 88.71 A: yes 

89.05 90.08 B: i think i'm 

90.71 92.66 B: excuse me i 

93.81 99.06 B: my wife used to work with autistic children in a therapeutic nursery so i've 

98.21 98.67 A: oh 

99.66 100.28 B: um 

100.69 101.75 B: curious about that 

102.17 102.49 B: i 

102.64 103.60 B: i don't think that 

103.95 105.21 B: learning to 

105.72 107.45 B: teaching speech was 

108.17 110.32 B: seems like just a small piece of what 

110.87 112.78 B: they did and i never heard of 

113.42 115.27 B: specifically doing speech with 

116.12 118.34 B: you know just doing speech stuff with them 

118.68 119.13 A: yes 

119.38 120.33 B: so that is done 

119.43 120.15 A: um 

120.60 120.92 A: yes 

121.27 123.95 A: yeah well that's what they do in the school system also 

124.58 131.09 A: um because they have different therapies in the school system working with the different kids with special needs 

131.56 132.06 A: um 

132.22 135.26 A: like the occupational therapist the physical therapist 

135.81 136.32 A: um 

136.44 137.60 A: and then the speech therapist 

138.34 138.74 B: huh 

138.57 138.89 A: so 

139.07 141.20 A: they are already in place in the school systems 

141.57 142.43 A: but um 

143.04 146.92 A: sometimes parents like to have extra help outside of the school children 

147.81 152.44 A: um and they also like to get their kids started earlier then what the school system provides 

153.03 156.04 A: and so they look for extra help 

157.10 158.45 A: and there's a great need for it 

159.12 159.44 B: huh 

159.59 160.36 B: how interesting 

159.84 162.92 A: so i know the need is their because my friend 

163.03 167.17 A: she is getting overwhelmed with a lot of phone calls form families 

168.05 172.47 A: and it's word of mouth right now her business she doesn't even have to advertise right now 

173.08 173.82 B: well that's great 

174.29 174.66 A: yeah 

174.81 177.10 B: it 

177.53 181.22 B: i guess there are supposed to be more and more autistic children for some reason 

181.15 186.87 A: actually the um ratio they're looking at is probably one in every three hundred and fifty kids 

187.25 187.70 B: and that's 

187.97 190.51 B: many more than there used to be i understand 

189.98 194.21 A: well many more than what had been diagnosed previously 

193.14 194.87 B: uh huh 

195.52 199.26 B: so there were more there were probably just out i've often thought that 

198.29 198.69 A: yes 

200.03 205.48 B: i probably had all kinds of conditions when i was a kid and so did all my friend but because we didn't have names for them 

205.91 209.99 B: we just went about our business and thought well that one's a little slow and that one's a little 

208.70 208.95 A: yup 

210.19 213.19 B: um antsy and that one's you know uh 

213.71 214.47 B: uh 

214.80 215.30 B: talks 

216.09 219.22 B: i don't know is you know talks too much or whatever uh 

219.61 220.61 B: and it was all just 

221.06 224.30 B: you know now we would if we were in the school system we would be 

224.80 225.67 B: um 

226.16 227.99 B: given names and sent to 

228.50 229.70 B: this diagnosed and 

229.82 233.14 B: sent to special sent to specialists who would know exactly how to 

233.85 237.15 B: uh to get us not to do just what it was that made us unique 

237.77 240.14 A: well i know well i know 

237.89 239.76 B: you know i mean i i don't 

239.91 241.36 B: this sounds cynical but uh 

241.11 245.80 A: well well it's well it's well it's being well some things are being over diagnosed 

244.68 247.09 B: i i guess i think of my classroom as a 

247.22 249.08 B: as a room as a child as a 

249.90 251.77 B: uh room full of quirky people 

252.10 252.60 A: well 

252.78 258.24 A: you have to think about too when we were going through school a lot of those kids were actually not in with us 

258.87 259.28 B: uh-huh 

260.32 261.03 B: so 

260.34 264.27 A: so a lot of them were labeled like learning disabled 

264.60 267.66 A: or like the mentally impaired kids 

267.87 268.34 B: mhm 

268.61 272.64 A: well they are now in the public school among all the other children 

273.20 274.28 A: and that was not 

274.45 275.74 A: that didn't happen 

276.18 277.52 A: before the seventies 

278.79 279.30 B: mhm 

279.71 280.71 A: and so 

281.18 282.98 A: now that the kids are there 

283.12 285.01 A: yes the kids are being diagnosed 

285.13 285.74 A: because 

286.37 287.56 A: they're there in the school 

288.22 289.71 A: and so it's a little different now 

289.84 292.28 B: and so if a child comes to you who 

292.69 296.39 B: let's see autistic means they don't talk much at all or they say they don't 

295.66 298.21 A: a lot of them are totally non verbal yes 

298.17 300.00 B: or what they say doesn't seem 

300.67 301.38 B: related 

301.89 304.91 B: to you it's not conversational it's not a way of 

305.43 306.93 B: communicating so much as 

307.10 309.70 A: yeah it's like a child walking around in circles 

309.86 310.86 A: on their toes 

310.96 312.28 A: and repeating 

312.41 314.46 A: ball ball ball ball ball 

314.77 315.68 A: and that's all they do 

314.78 315.21 B: mhm 

315.69 316.11 B: mhm 

316.46 316.77 A: yeah 

318.80 321.20 B: so the thera- so speech therapy would be 

321.86 323.52 B: um to get them 

323.87 326.48 A: to communicate to get them to interact with other people 

325.60 327.23 B: to use language for interaction 

327.19 327.52 A: yeah 

328.15 329.01 B: interaction 

329.09 329.46 A: yeah 

329.41 329.95 B: uh-huh 

330.91 332.41 B: how interesting now i'm i'm 

333.00 334.37 B: asking you all these questions and i'm 

334.62 336.39 B: thinking what kind of business would i 

336.54 338.74 B: start i have no idea 

338.93 346.83 B: uh my wife has a yarn store i work in it after work and before work some time just uh putting yarn 

347.52 354.49 B: back on the shelves opening boxes piling the uh tying up the boxes and carting them out just 

355.43 360.44 B: doing the stuff that a a non knitter can do surrounded by people that want information about knitting 

360.51 361.35 A: oh yeah 

361.94 362.74 B: uh 

363.11 364.00 B: and 

364.33 368.12 A: i'm surprised there's a market for the in new york 

366.42 371.03 B: there is an incredible market for it it's amazing they won't leave us alone 

369.11 370.29 A: that's amazing 

370.99 371.91 A: wow 

371.63 374.32 B: uh it's it's like the um 

374.45 378.49 B: post feminist wave everyone who grew up uh 

376.59 377.43 A: oh 

378.68 380.61 B: you know not wanting to uh 

381.95 389.64 B: i think that all the all those domestic or fe- feminine arts were beyond them and they all went out and became lawyers and 

382.29 384.79 A: do domestic 

386.14 386.72 A: yes 

389.41 389.91 A: right 

389.76 391.97 B: computer geniuses and uh 

392.09 392.89 B: whatever 

393.17 394.35 B: they are suddenly 

395.71 401.15 B: they and the daughters that they raised not too many of the sons um 

402.32 403.70 B: all suddenly want to get 

404.66 406.68 B: seem to want to get back to you know 

407.19 408.22 B: learning about these 

415.33 416.35 B: it's amazing how many 

415.40 415.73 A: hm 

416.16 417.18 A: that is amazing 

417.39 419.56 A: of course around here we have the amish 

419.86 422.72 A: and we're so used to that 

422.19 424.79 B: the amish knit or you're used to the traditional craft 

423.52 423.91 A: yeah 

424.62 426.53 A: exactly 

425.79 427.03 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

427.71 428.26 B: um 

429.38 430.99 B: so i was thinking what would i would 

431.11 433.82 B: sell tools of some kind i think would be great 

433.93 434.19 B: fun 

435.02 436.85 B: just wonderful old tools 

436.95 437.91 B: uh 

437.84 439.67 A: like vintage tools or

445.52 447.68 B: mechanical things and uh 

448.07 451.80 B: things for making things or fixing things so it would be fun to 

453.24 454.52 B: have an excuse to collect them 

456.74 457.29 B: maybe book 

457.45 458.10 B: maybe i guess 

458.24 461.68 B: that it would really come down to if i was going to have a business it would have 

463.13 463.67 A: oh 

463.29 466.54 B: it would have to be a second hand bookstore and i could just buy 

467.07 470.39 B: the tools are just a way of getting me out of the house so i can get away from my books 

470.91 472.71 B: uh so i think
