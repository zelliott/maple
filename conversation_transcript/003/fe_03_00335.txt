54.66 61.75 B: i didn't know that there were businesses like that i can sort of understand it when i applied to the graduate school a couple of years ago it was an enormous job 

62.44 63.72 B: and i can think if there's someone 

64.12 67.46 B: who could've helped me that i i might've been willing to pay that person 

67.72 72.68 A: right just deciding you know sorting out the different colleges and different choices and 

72.21 72.62 B: yeah 

73.33 77.53 A: things like that especially for students who might not have parents who went to college 

77.40 77.81 B: yeah 

78.05 79.37 A: that type of thing so 

79.02 81.22 B: and every school has different requirements (( )) 

81.71 83.06 B: it's quite a complicated 

83.20 84.36 B: process to apply 

83.84 84.92 A: yes it is 

85.62 86.95 A: so what about your business 

88.01 88.40 B: well 

88.57 97.01 B: i'm not a business oriented person at all so you know i think if i had a choice i wouldn't have opened a business but seeing as that i now have to suppose that i 

91.68 92.11 A: mhm 

94.73 95.63 A: right 

97.47 100.03 B: that i would open a business i think i i would probably 

101.56 102.65 B: (( )) liked uh 

103.19 105.11 B: like a confectionery shop 

105.98 107.68 B: specialty baking kind thing 

107.82 109.70 A: wonderful that sounds very good 

109.62 110.39 B: but i'm sure i would 

111.14 111.52 B: you know 

111.95 116.16 B: do a terrible job of running the business and it would go bankrupt very quickly 

116.71 121.54 A: i don't know about that everybody's looking for some homemade food nowadays it seems 

124.78 126.04 B: but i've always enjoyed 

126.24 126.89 B: baking 

127.11 127.53 A: mhm 

128.10 128.74 B: and 

129.64 131.62 B: and sometimes when i have a lot of confidence i 

131.85 132.94 B: i would try to be 

133.06 134.38 B: adventurous and 

134.80 135.25 A: mhm 

135.21 136.41 B: make something special 

137.32 138.58 A: well that sounds wonderful 

139.77 140.71 B: and i i think if you 

140.97 143.03 B: you know if you want to start something like a business 

143.38 145.60 B: good if it's something you actually enjoy doing right 

146.03 149.72 A: right eh i've always said you you know shouldn't hate your job or 

149.91 150.47 A: you should 

150.61 152.80 A: make your life's work something that you enjoy and 

153.67 154.80 A: (( )) doing so 

157.05 158.07 B: the job that you do it 

159.35 159.77 B: probably 

160.03 160.72 B: your most 

161.68 164.18 B: the most of your waking hours you spend working 

164.56 165.29 A: yes 

165.41 167.36 B: so yes it is something that you should enjoy 

167.67 168.44 A: definitely 

169.06 171.55 A: i'm not too entrepreneurial 

172.85 173.18 A: i 

173.37 175.39 A: like you said i work at a university and i really 

176.11 178.82 A: know enjoy having that kind of job security and 

179.48 181.35 A: in these economic times i think it'd be 

181.60 183.21 A: tough economically to be 

184.00 185.27 A: entrepreneurial and 

186.38 187.71 A: and be out there on your own 

188.60 190.42 B: well i also like the security 

190.71 192.39 B: you know half of my family are 

190.80 191.23 A: mhm 

192.51 193.53 B: in business and 

194.13 195.11 B: all of them of course 

195.88 196.24 B: you know 

197.45 197.92 B: makes 

198.20 198.75 B: about 

198.86 201.15 B: twice as much money as i would ever make 

201.13 202.79 A: right are you an ec- 

201.99 207.43 B: but i i always tell myself well you know i know exactly how much money i'm going to have at the end of this month 

207.26 207.81 A: mhm 

207.86 209.74 B: and i know when i retire one day 

210.50 211.71 A: they'll be some money there 

211.49 213.24 B: there will be some there yes 

212.48 214.66 A: are you in academia too is that 

214.42 216.43 B: yes well i'm in still in graduate school but 

216.72 218.59 B: i hope one day to be in academia yeah 

218.78 219.08 A: yeah 

219.61 221.11 A: are you in a linguistics department 

221.09 221.39 B: yes 

222.08 225.44 A: i uh i'm actually a staff member in a linguistics department so 

225.76 226.30 A: that's how 

227.22 229.13 A: i got hooked up with this study i think 

229.17 231.84 B: yeah well i probably a lot of linguists doing this 

231.97 233.34 A: right 

232.52 232.92 B: yeah 

233.46 237.85 A: i think i signed up all of our undergrads for a little holiday money 

240.50 242.21 B: so maybe you should start a business 

243.18 245.47 B: finding opportunities like these for undergraduate 

245.45 246.73 A: right 

245.82 248.61 B: you know (( )) get some spending money for the holiday 

248.43 254.40 A: well you know we run our own studies and recruit from our intro class subject pools and 

254.74 255.44 A: so 

255.63 257.67 A: we help out a lit- our undergrads that way 

257.67 259.25 B: yeah well we do the same thing 

259.60 259.96 A: mhm 

260.02 260.49 B: um 

261.06 262.43 B: it's not always easy to convince 

262.58 266.53 B: american undergraduates though to do a study that pays only like ten dollars 

267.44 267.82 B: i think 

268.15 272.30 A: we're we're starting to pay a little more sometimes fifteen or twenty if 

272.59 273.04 B: yeah 

272.68 276.51 A: you know we have them sit and talk for an hour or listen for an hour 

277.07 277.41 A: but 

277.59 278.86 A: yeah ten dollars is 

279.67 281.21 A: not as much as it used to be 

281.84 283.37 A: barely lunch anymore so 

285.41 286.76 B: so another kind of business that 

286.91 287.79 B: that i would en- 

288.38 291.29 B: thought but that my wife i think would've liked to start is 

291.67 293.88 B: you know we are from south africa originally 

293.93 294.29 A: mhm 

294.54 295.43 B: and she's always 

295.63 297.39 B: she was also always of the opinion that 

298.89 299.18 B: you know 

299.43 302.41 B: there aren't enough south african things available in this country 

303.22 305.96 B: so she always wanted to start some kind of importing business 

303.24 303.90 A: interesting 

306.05 306.51 A: mhm 

307.70 310.86 B: and she actually has the personality that she might make a success of it 
310.80 313.41 A: you do have to have a certain 

311.93 312.43 B: new 

313.51 315.92 A: personality i think to make a go out of it 

315.98 316.33 B: yeah 

317.78 318.45 A: what things 

318.55 319.83 A: do you think she would sell like 

320.02 321.96 A: gift items or clothing or 

322.97 324.06 B: well probably 

324.20 325.65 B: probably both of those things 

325.73 326.12 A: mhm 

325.77 327.13 B: (( )) sometimes 

328.34 330.26 B: you know once or twice when we were in new york city 

331.15 332.54 B: you would actually find some 

332.81 333.72 B: south african 

334.79 338.11 B: you know native that that the native people make some kind of gift 

338.44 338.85 A: mhm 

338.67 341.26 B: but then it would be extraordinarily expensive 

342.10 342.50 B: and 

342.68 343.34 B: you know from 

343.71 347.72 B: from having lived in that country for so long both of us know you can walk 

348.75 356.09 B: on the street and on every second street corner buy those exact same things for a tenth of the price that they sell them for here 

355.05 355.70 A: uh-huh 

356.53 357.73 B: so 

357.85 359.81 B: so she always of the opinion that she could probably 

360.05 361.74 B: import them much cheaper and 

361.87 362.59 A: right 

362.39 364.16 B: and and pay the people on the other end 

364.47 366.95 B: um better than what they probably are paid now 

366.53 367.05 A: mhm 

367.83 368.84 A: so everybody wins 

368.92 369.46 B: yeah 

370.71 373.51 B: but then then also clothes clothing in this country 

373.84 374.67 B: so expensive 

374.84 377.59 B: compared to what what we used to pay for it back home 

374.87 375.38 A: mhm 

378.75 381.34 B: (( )) if you were to im- even if you were to buy it in a 

381.60 382.38 B: in a regular 

382.56 384.28 B: clothing shop on that side 

384.71 385.15 A: mhm 

385.07 388.99 B: and fly it over here it would still be less expensive than what it used to 

389.21 389.99 A: oh my goodness 

389.90 391.10 B: to buy clothes here 

392.60 393.66 A: very interesting 

395.47 397.03 B: so maybe that is also an option 

397.34 397.80 A: mhm 

399.04 403.28 A: well my in-laws are pretty entrepreneurial my mother in-law owns her own tailor shop 

404.60 405.06 A: so 

405.50 407.45 A: uh you know often my husband's told me 

407.63 410.25 A: yo quit your job and you can make more money sewing with my mother 

411.22 411.88 A: but 

412.07 416.48 A: i don't think i'd do very well i don't think i'd make very much mon- money for her 

416.99 418.18 A: but she does 

417.49 419.29 B: (( what else )) does she make clothes for 

419.55 420.84 B: for men or women or both 

421.10 422.96 A: well mainly she does alterations 

423.45 426.09 A: and um she sells wedding dresses also 

426.27 429.44 A: and along with the wedding dresses she sells them at a discount and they 

429.65 432.12 A: you know pay for their alterations with her and 

432.23 434.74 A: so so she does very well she's in a small town 

436.00 437.54 A: (( )) the only game in town 

439.31 442.21 B: but to to have a business like that you should actually like doing 

442.46 443.29 A: yes 

443.07 444.35 B: needle work 

444.06 445.81 A: which i wouldn't be good at 

445.92 446.50 B: yeah 

446.90 447.91 A: but she does 

448.05 449.34 A: fabulously so 

450.52 451.35 B: and honestly i'm 

451.70 452.78 B: i'm also not sure that 

453.09 453.43 B: you know 

454.24 456.69 B: that if i absolutely had to start a business i would 

457.11 459.07 B: i would want to do it together with family 

459.37 459.80 A: mhm 

459.92 460.26 B: know 

461.31 462.90 B: relationships with family are often 

463.46 464.90 B: difficult enough that if 

465.19 467.52 B: shouldn't involve money and business in that also 

466.21 467.49 A: right 

467.68 471.43 A: once you bring money into it then all bets are off 

471.58 472.35 A: i agree 

473.31 475.62 B: and that's something that that my family does you know 

475.76 476.55 B: my father and 

476.89 480.57 B: two of my brothers are all in the same business and i sometimes worry because of that 

480.80 484.52 B: you know if if there anything were to happen to the business it's like the whole family 

484.00 485.02 A: the whole family 

485.09 485.49 B: yeah 

485.59 486.71 A: that's all you then 

486.64 487.53 B: oh yes 

488.40 488.78 B: (( )) 

488.91 491.12 A: on your (( )) assistant professor's salary 

490.84 491.79 B: yeah 

492.68 493.52 B: so (( )) if i 

493.61 494.18 B: if i had to 

494.43 496.40 B: convert the money into south african currency 

496.81 498.13 B: it's a reasonable amount 

498.27 498.69 B: so 

500.76 501.88 A: um very interesting 

505.22 505.64 B: so 

507.58 509.57 B: tell me something more about your business 

509.41 511.81 A: well um 

512.38 516.01 A: i'm also a master's student in a higher education program so that's why we've been 

516.32 517.46 A: studying these ah 

518.36 521.10 A: you know i guess they call them pre-college counselors 

522.77 525.61 A: i've read about them mainly in new york and l._a. you know real 

526.22 527.04 A: affluent 

527.31 532.32 A: places and they pay gobs of money to these people who know how to write a personal statement and 

533.68 535.61 A: know what colleges are good and 

535.97 537.53 A: research these kind of things 

537.94 538.25 A: so 

538.99 540.18 A: thought well i could stay in ac- 

540.30 541.26 A: -demia 

541.40 542.57 A: or 

543.24 545.54 A: you know make a lot of money doing this other way but 

546.61 548.13 A: i do like where i'm at though 

549.11 549.46 A: i don't 

550.17 551.74 A: know if i'd ever go that way 

553.12 554.63 B: sounds a bit unfair to me too 

554.93 558.46 B: to be writing personal statements for people when they apply to college for 

559.33 560.05 A: oh well the 

559.81 562.55 B: in that the nature it's a personal statement 

562.70 565.11 B: so if someone else writes it for you how personal (( )) 

565.27 569.08 A: well they say there you know just help with editing and things but i think 

569.42 572.72 A: you know the amount of money these people get paid they probably have a 

573.24 575.53 A: bigger hand in it than they admit to 

576.69 577.02 A: so
