96.38 97.11 B: well i helped with 

97.96 100.58 B: kind of the whole conceptualization but then also 

100.84 102.46 B: doing some of the work of um 

103.11 104.40 B: you know finding out what kind of 

105.00 105.40 B: um 

106.68 107.88 B: forms we had to 

108.07 109.68 B: fill out and file and 

109.80 110.19 B: you know 

110.42 112.04 B: kind of all the legalities of how to 

112.74 115.81 B: set it up as an official non-profit and get the 

116.28 118.23 B: tax free status and everything 

118.59 119.26 A: mhm was 

118.60 119.17 B: tax exempt 

119.73 121.14 A: was it a success was that 

121.39 121.87 B: yeah 

121.43 121.89 A: something that 

122.00 123.29 B: it's going yeah 

122.03 122.99 A: still around 

123.66 126.73 B: it's still around it's in seattle though i've moved but 

126.87 127.22 B: yeah 

127.84 129.02 B: still going strong 

130.01 130.85 A: that's pretty good 

130.93 131.97 B: yeah 

130.97 134.07 A: well i'm i'm working for a start-up company right now 

134.13 134.64 B: oh 

134.29 134.94 A: and they're uh 

135.05 136.27 A: they have a website 

137.28 139.91 A: and it's kind of a new company too so 

137.31 137.72 B: uh-huh 

140.44 141.65 A: looking at how 

141.77 143.42 A: new businesses get started 

145.28 146.99 A: it's interesting for me to 

147.28 148.83 A: have this topic 

148.92 150.48 B: yeah it sounds like 

149.53 156.52 A: because i've actually considered having a business of my own uh it just the bottom line is always money so 

156.67 163.82 A: the money is no object is kind of an interesting twist on the situation because if money was no object i'd already be a business owner 

160.29 160.76 B: right 

163.67 164.12 B: right 

165.25 165.58 A: so 

165.74 168.17 A: and i think i would do a good job i've been told that i would 

168.37 168.73 A: do 

168.89 170.41 A: pretty well managing people 

171.04 175.35 B: oh that sounds good sounds like you should uh be looking for loans to start your own business 

175.78 179.40 A: yeah well i i already have s- school loans to pay off 

179.25 179.81 B: okay 

179.94 180.41 B: yeah 

180.57 181.31 B: pay those off first 

181.84 182.51 A: yes 

183.05 183.39 A: plan 

185.74 186.28 B: um 

185.88 187.87 A: so i i don't know what else uh 

188.02 189.13 A: we're supposed to do here 

189.38 189.94 B: um 

189.52 189.97 A: huh 

190.67 194.10 B: i guess we're supposed to keep talking though like more maybe more in detail what 

195.08 196.34 B: what kind of business what 

196.52 198.49 B: what's your dream business what would you want to own 

203.74 204.86 B: say computer services is 

205.13 206.92 B: can you be more specific what kind of 

208.42 211.40 A: well probably open up a business that 

211.58 212.19 A: serves 

212.58 213.06 A: um 

213.59 214.19 A: serve the 

214.51 215.49 A: local area 

216.24 217.52 A: or is networking 

217.65 219.00 A: opening different or 

219.38 220.35 A: starting up or 

220.56 220.94 A: ma- 

221.08 224.62 A: maintaining the different networks computer networks that businesses have 

225.49 228.08 A: going out to people's houses maybe fixing computers 

228.21 229.30 B: uh-huh 

229.31 230.10 A: that kind of stuff 

230.28 230.79 A: um 

230.36 230.76 B: mhm 

232.14 233.08 A: i'd probably have 

233.61 236.49 A: different people different technicians working for me 

237.31 241.08 A: i'd depending on how quickly the computer uh the business grew 

241.78 242.65 A: i'd probably 

243.41 245.45 A: end up hiring accountants or 

246.29 247.86 A: maybe sales people 

248.21 248.60 B: uh-huh 

248.98 250.53 A: people to represent the company 

250.80 251.24 B: mhm 

251.68 253.85 A: uh very likely open a website 

254.43 254.90 B: mhm 

255.01 255.33 A: that 

256.34 258.29 A: showed about what the company was about 

258.81 263.03 A: just basic things things that i think are basic to opening up a business 

263.35 263.77 B: mhm 

264.54 265.69 A: and then maybe 

265.90 267.91 A: open up a different branch in a 

268.04 268.46 A: different 

269.07 269.51 B: mhm 

269.16 270.25 A: probably pick the same 

271.21 272.27 A: uh same state 

272.85 273.92 A: but different town 

272.96 273.35 B: mhm 

274.72 276.82 A: uh expand in that working area 

279.23 279.66 A: don't know 

280.66 283.45 A: that would be my idea about opening a bus- opening up a business 

283.77 284.14 B: uh-huh 

286.29 286.54 A: so 

287.21 289.68 A: and if money was no object i'd probably have to 

290.29 291.91 A: worry about hiring people 

292.24 292.68 B: right 

292.61 293.73 A: screening the kinds of 

294.24 296.23 A: applicants that want to work for my company 

296.41 296.81 B: uh-huh 

297.10 297.60 A: it's a large 

297.88 300.93 A: portion of owning a business is hiring and firing people 

300.86 303.43 B: right yeah and making sure you get good people 

303.83 304.47 A: exactly 

305.20 305.59 B: yeah 

305.72 310.22 B: well i guess that's the thing if money's no object then at least you can you can compensate them very well and 

311.51 312.91 A: sure and then you can hire 

313.00 314.28 A: good quality people 

314.21 314.83 B: exactly 

316.51 316.86 B: but 

316.82 318.06 A: that'd be nice 

317.40 317.94 B: you can 

318.06 318.56 B: yeah 

318.84 321.68 B: and you know you can like give them what they deserve and 

321.80 323.39 B: and that what will keep them happy 

334.60 335.07 B: high quality 

338.68 341.38 A: and it's actually really unfortunate uh that you 

341.62 342.13 A: can't 

342.29 343.02 A: get a loan 

343.91 346.65 A: whenever you want to we have this uh this whole 

348.36 354.16 A: you know credit report thing and they all go through and they look at you and see how many loans you have and 

354.37 354.76 B: uh-huh 

355.40 357.06 A: mm if at least money wa- if 

357.92 362.27 A: credit reports and if your credit was no object if money was no object then 

362.81 364.98 A: it would a lot easier opening up a business 

365.06 365.55 B: right 

368.12 368.44 A: (( so that's )) 

374.57 375.99 A: you have your little girl with you 

376.03 377.25 B: i do yeah 

376.99 377.43 A: huh 

379.55 379.87 A: funny 

380.33 381.63 B: she's just four months old 

386.06 387.76 A: so iowa i guess 

387.93 388.74 A: business 

389.07 389.35 A: uh 

389.55 391.28 A: i i don't know i looked on the website 

391.74 396.32 A: and it says that iowa was one of the worst states to open a new business in 

396.51 397.39 B: really why 

397.95 401.09 A: i i think it's because of how taxes are 

401.45 401.91 B: huh 

401.55 403.66 A: and because of how economy is and 

404.13 407.92 A: rating the different states iowa rate- ranked all the way 

408.26 411.58 A: at the bottom of the list of opening up new businesses 

412.14 412.69 B: wow 

413.13 414.36 A: and i think they rated by 

414.82 416.42 A: um how many people 

416.64 420.07 A: already have business in iowa and have failed 

419.88 420.34 B: uh-huh 

420.35 424.10 A: and how the uh h- how rate how high the tax rates are 

424.19 424.62 B: mhm 

425.48 426.29 A: and i 

426.42 427.65 A: i don't know it's kind of uh 

428.45 430.05 A: so i've been thinking about it because 

430.63 433.50 A: i was thinking about doing this with the computer business 

434.07 436.36 A: with my fiance here and 

436.52 438.59 A: uh then we looked at this website and it says 

438.96 441.54 A: yup that worst that you can open your new business in is 

441.64 442.33 A: iowa 

442.28 443.02 B: oh no 

442.82 447.45 A: great but it's not like we're going to be doing that any time soon 

447.41 447.85 B: uh-huh 

448.49 453.35 A: because of my loans and because we really don't have the means to open a new business 

453.34 453.81 B: uh-huh 

454.96 455.27 A: but 

455.51 458.13 A: i have a pretty good job right now so i'm not too worried about it 

458.22 458.86 B: that's good 

459.13 461.61 B: well and working for a start up is a little bit like uh 

463.26 465.69 B: well if you're in the in that at kind of the beginning then 

466.38 468.17 B: sort of like opening your own business i mean 

468.01 468.27 A: it 

468.44 469.92 A: it kind of is i kind of 

468.64 470.15 B: it's not totally yours but 

470.80 471.66 B: you're in on the 

470.82 471.18 A: yes 

472.58 474.88 B: on the well the start of the whole beginning and 

475.70 476.05 B: the 

477.29 478.61 B: -ception of the idea and 

482.98 486.31 B: one if one day you do have an opportunity to open your own business because you 

486.83 488.66 B: see the whole process of 

489.11 490.24 B: building the business 

493.13 494.15 B: hopefully to a bigger 

494.93 495.97 B: business or 

496.37 499.81 B: if it should fail then you'll learn from those mistakes too 

499.88 503.15 A: sure and when i started working there they only had about thirty employees 

503.94 507.76 A: which for uh let's see how long it was about a six month old 

508.32 508.98 A: company 

509.29 509.74 B: mhm 

509.56 512.17 A: that's a lot of employees to have at the beginning 

512.36 512.79 B: uh-huh 

512.79 516.57 A: but it's already more than doubled right now we have sixty two employees 

516.56 518.69 B: wow 

522.91 524.39 A: so thinking about it that way 

524.98 525.51 B: uh-huh 

525.07 526.95 A: and i'm i'm really excited for 

527.55 529.60 A: how quickly the company's growing and 

530.77 532.54 A: we're uh at the new year's we're 

533.83 534.90 A: releasing a new 

535.85 537.23 A: a new revision of the website 

537.63 538.18 B: mhm 

538.16 539.76 A: and i've been working on the team 

540.45 544.84 A: creating this new release and working out ironing ironing out the detail 

545.27 545.71 B: great 

545.95 547.14 A: i'm really excited about it 

546.09 547.01 B: that sounds exciting 

547.23 547.68 B: yeah 

547.46 547.82 A: yeah it's 

549.59 550.21 A: pretty fun 

554.21 555.73 A: but yeah that's uh 

554.22 554.57 B: wow 

556.82 558.95 A: that's pretty much my side of the story 

558.70 559.21 B: yeah 

560.04 561.14 B: well i was just thinking my 

561.56 564.28 B: my husband's good friend opened his own business it
