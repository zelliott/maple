2.26 4.38 A: hi connie my name is warren 

3.91 5.05 B: hi warren 

5.11 7.11 B: [lipsmack] um 

6.44 12.96 A: okay so do do either of us cont- consider other any other countries to be threats to the u._s. security 

12.49 15.22 B: at the present time yeah 

15.35 18.96 B: ah yes i think i think we are in a little bit of danger 

18.42 20.77 A: yes i well i ah 

20.81 26.55 A: north korea is not causing me any great ah any great ah ease at night 

26.10 28.38 B: that's right it was a nuclear threat 

26.67 27.55 A: um 

27.90 30.40 A: yes i and 

29.81 33.25 B: and that's kind of a surprise 'cause that's has been in the background for 

32.84 33.74 A: yes 

33.75 38.75 B: i could guess the arabs' situation's kind of covered that up for 

39.26 41.35 B: a good length of time [lipsmack] 

40.51 42.09 A: yes it's true 

42.91 53.28 A: um i confess that i am ah i am not impressed by mr bush's ah attempts to make iraq out to be a a massive threat 

53.40 56.06 A: ah it would be easier if 

56.19 59.38 A: saddam hussain were not such a creep 

58.82 63.95 B: [laughter] it would be it would be far easier if we had some support from other countries 

63.45 64.77 A: exactly 

65.18 65.94 A: um 

65.29 70.56 B: it this u- unilaterally going in there is going would cause us a huge amount of trouble i think 

70.20 71.10 A: yes 

70.78 75.15 B: we we we'd lose out good guy white hat status [laughter] 

73.57 82.63 A: well i think that we've come close to losing good guy white hat status at any rate ah i've just returned from a stay in india and ah 

80.95 82.36 B: ooh 

83.53 93.27 A: there's a there's a great deal of speculation there about what's going to happen and of course ah mr bush's attitude towards ah pakistan 

93.28 100.69 A: and the general change in the united states' attitude towards india has been ah the subject of enormous amounts of concern over there 

99.85 105.99 B: i'm not sure that i'm all that familiar with his status [mn] are [mn] have we 

105.88 115.25 A: well you remember after september eleventh he began ah putting a lot of u._s. emphasis on ah cooperation with pakistan and 

114.25 118.36 B: sure because we needed their bases there mhm 

116.17 120.57 A: exactly but the the flip side of that is that pakistan 

120.46 133.25 A: was not a democracy and hasn't been a democracy for a damn long time and india is a democracy and so there was a general consensus in india that bush was giving india a short shrift ah 

124.98 125.81 B: (( mm )) 

126.85 128.65 B: mhm 

132.34 133.32 B: [lipsmack] oh boy 

133.14 141.76 A: because of course he wanted some place that was proximate to afghanistan and then secondarily there was a general consensus in india that ah 

142.10 150.18 A: ah mr bush is entirely ready to cooperate with military democracies as long as they're america's military democracies 

149.03 151.39 B: [laughter] true 

150.63 153.05 A: or military dictatorships rather 

152.37 154.55 B: (( mhm )) 

154.12 155.13 A: um 

156.10 162.38 A: aside from that ah you know when i think about countries that are threats to the united states 

163.49 168.14 A: [sigh] i have to wonder what's really meant by a threat 

168.24 172.42 A: i sometimes feel like the biggest threat to the united states is the united states 

173.02 175.27 B: [sigh] [laughter] i don't know about that but 

175.69 181.93 B: i'm i'm not afraid of you know losing the united states as it is or losing a war 

181.41 183.42 A: mhm yes that's true 

183.04 187.67 B: i'm just afraid of terrorist attacks like like nine eleven um 

188.11 198.03 B: um um i don't know what they could do now that w- would be as have such an you know as big an impact as that had um 

197.57 204.62 A: oh i can imagine any number of things and i don't really [laughter] there's there's all sorts of things that can keep you awake ah 

203.52 205.14 B: (( [laughter] yes well )) 

204.87 205.65 A: ah 

205.18 207.82 B: biological warfares and things like that but 

207.21 212.23 A: well for that matter just ah someone driving a tank full of gasoline 

211.95 212.99 B: sure 

212.40 213.21 A: (( you know )) 

213.27 214.20 A: (( um [mn] )) 

214.45 221.88 B: i live in a high rise building with a parking garage underneath [laughter] there are nights i don't sleep too well mhm 

217.35 219.27 A: yep exactly 

219.29 220.47 A: exactly 

220.45 231.49 A: i i it it has seemed to me that in the period of time since september eleventh that what we were looking at prior to september eleventh was a situation in which 

231.30 232.21 A: (( ah )) 

231.98 246.93 A: the generally accepted ah shallowness of mr bush's intellect was in a sense compensated for by the sharpness of the people who were as it were handling him whether or not you agree with with his politics i personally do not 

242.80 243.62 B: (( [mn] yes )) 

246.67 248.68 B: mhm 

246.71 250.63 A: ah is is immaterial in that in that case i mean the 

249.82 252.31 B: he did pick some smart guys around him 

251.14 259.79 A: yeah he's got some smart guys well i think they picked him in a sense i don't think that i don't think that that he had a lot to do with the picking i think that he's 

254.28 256.13 B: (( [laughter] yeah i )) 

258.63 259.54 B: mhm 

259.61 266.22 A: a little bit more figure head but i think that september eleventh changed the balance of power dramatically and put 

266.08 278.62 A: put bush in a a strong leadership position and what that means is that now he's ah his public pronouncements and his ah conception of policy has a great deal more influence 

278.59 287.51 A: ah than it did before then and the this is part of the the real concern that i have and what what makes me think in a sense that 

287.36 294.16 A: that the biggest danger to america is right now really ah is is our own national actions 

293.98 295.17 B: (( [mn] uh-huh [mn] )) 

294.62 295.43 A: (( ah )) 

295.46 310.16 A: the the ah vacillating between iraq and north korea for example and the absolutely bizarre sets of rationalizations that that they're trying to come up with well it's perfectly okay they have na- they have nuclear weapons sorry that should be nuclear weapons 

310.04 311.17 A: um 

311.27 318.24 A: ah but we don't have anything to worry about that because we've always known about them or something 

315.73 317.12 B: (( [laughter] ah )) 

317.32 323.82 B: well his his refusal to follow any of clinton's policies is is annoying huh [mn] 

321.37 322.22 A: yes 

324.26 327.53 B: we had some things that worked you know why not keep doing them 

327.10 328.36 A: yes 

327.71 333.19 B: and i don't understand his popularity i see his popularity polls he's still over fifty percent 

333.42 340.78 B: and what with what's happened to our ec- economy our own economy should've brought that down 

338.69 339.72 A: i know 

340.54 353.37 A: well that's part of what's going on i think the ah the ah uproar about iraq ah coincided in a rather significantly coincidental way with the uproar over enron 

353.24 364.70 A: i think that there was definitely a need for a wag the dog type of ah scenario to play out there because a lot of those people are awfully close to mr bush 

353.25 354.31 B: oh 

359.79 362.41 B: mhm 

363.97 369.58 B: [lipsmack] if not he himself right yeah yeah 

365.63 367.85 A: and ab- well that's exactly right 

368.02 369.62 A: (( and ah )) 

370.09 374.10 B: and convince me that this whole thing's not about oil the thing in iraq 

373.22 375.29 A: (( [mn] )) 

374.15 376.35 B: [laughter] 

376.51 377.45 B: (( [sigh] mm )) 

376.60 380.37 A: well that's that's one of the things that i think is 

380.30 389.41 A: it's remarked on outside this country you know in in the newspapers in india and political commentary in india and also in the just the people that i talk to um 

389.34 398.51 A: they they would turn and ask me what basically they'd say what the hell is going on why is this person acting like this 

398.25 399.04 B: (( mm )) 

399.00 403.67 A: and really there was a there was a general bafflement um 

404.23 419.15 A: and i think in another ah another ah way of thinking about this my experience as hav- someone who's lived in the third world for many years i lived in india for about six years and and done a lot of travelling um 

419.94 426.52 A: the average american is ah extremely insular and has a very short attention span 

426.94 437.21 A: [mn] and when i i'd look at um i remember i think it was in nineteen ninety four when the prime minister of india was visiting the united states and did a joint press conference with clinton 

435.76 439.15 B: mhm 

437.81 444.70 A: and there was exactly one question asked about india or pakistan or the entire ah 

444.65 453.33 A: that entire half of the world um by the team of washington press corps and everything else was ah concerned with clinton's domestic policies 

452.89 455.50 B: [lipsmack] oh my goodness [laughter] that's absurd 

453.75 454.75 A: and 

455.26 465.97 A: well it is absurd and that it got played up rather strongly in the indian press that that effectively americans don't know damn all about the rest of the world and they don't care 

455.80 456.80 B: (( huh )) 

465.94 477.97 A: and unfortunately well there's a there's ah well over a billion people in india right now that's more than there are in the united states america is not in the majority 

472.54 473.66 B: oh yes 

477.23 486.81 B: i the two countries that i don't want us messing with is india and china i i i think they're they're the two that we could lose to 

482.50 483.58 A: that's right 

486.68 492.35 B: if if we were ever to lose but india so much of the culture [mn] 

493.15 494.20 B: (( it )) 

494.46 501.48 B: i- it is very different but there are things that are are much the same the the way they approach business 

501.44 502.63 A: mhm 

502.28 507.20 B: ah ah i was a computer programmer and i know that um 

504.73 505.49 A: yes 

507.57 512.91 B: that some very talented programming's being done over there ah 

510.28 512.28 A: oh very very much so 

512.37 524.79 A: and in in fact there was ah a general consensus that during the previous spate of ah muscle flexing between india and pakistan where it really seemed as though there might actually be a border war 

524.17 525.29 B: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

524.67 537.90 A: um the people from the information technology sector actually ah got together in a sort of consortium and went to the prime minister of india and said you must stop this it's bad for business 

537.35 538.94 B: yes it would be 

537.77 543.86 A: and a lot of the the real problem there and this is an area in which i think we're we can 

543.90 552.19 A: harking back to the original concern ah that was addressed in our our conversational subject what countries are are 

550.53 551.56 B: (( [noise] )) 

552.26 561.48 A: ah reflect on the security of the united states i think that there's a very very high possibility of a nuclear exchange between pakistan and india in the near future 

552.82 555.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

561.00 562.80 B: mhm 

561.37 571.32 A: ah i don't like that at all i have family in india and friends over there all over the country and i i know that you know people who are my people would die but 

570.45 572.04 B: (( oh sure )) 

571.51 575.17 A: but but more to the point in a broad general way 

575.20 588.63 A: just because two countries on the other side of the globe get into a war and blow up millions of people doesn't mean that it's irrelevant to the united states' security it means that it it would ah grossly destabilize the ah 

588.56 596.87 A: ah the nature of of world politics right now and i i think that that's something that ah that that really terrifies me 

591.40 593.40 B: mhm 

596.69 597.57 B: mm 

597.03 599.91 A: so i don't just think it's what you know what could
