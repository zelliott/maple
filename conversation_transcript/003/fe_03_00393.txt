12.63 13.34 B: (( )) 

17.10 17.58 B: right 

17.70 20.42 B: right pro-- about international relations and such 

20.42 26.39 A: yeah um which country do you consider a threat and why i i feel that like i'm 

25.90 26.46 B: you know i 

26.84 28.06 B: i have to admit i really don't 

28.31 32.73 B: and just keep up with it you know i know i've been seeing the stuff with iraq and 

32.91 33.51 B: um

45.60 46.95 B: but yeah 

47.39 57.12 A: yeah exactly i mean one of the things that i found was sort of thought of [laugh] interesting for me was um there are lot of countries that considered you know would be a threat but nothing 

57.45 65.52 A: but nothing like an extreme individual threat i mean there are people who are bad but a country as a whole i find that hard to comprehend 

65.14 65.57 B: right 

66.01 67.43 B: and it might just be um 

67.75 78.73 B: the u._s. being really excited about themselves but it always seems like that um they make us as americans think that you know no country will be dumb enough to fight against 

78.85 84.50 B: our country and so i don't know i i guess as americans we see kind of like a partial view of um 

84.60 86.59 B: the world situation but 

86.88 87.86 A: i know a- 

87.48 87.87 B: [noise] 

88.22 95.59 A: i know i read um i occasionally read uh the economist magazine which is british publication and it talks about the u._s. 

94.02 95.16 B: mhm 

95.71 103.24 A: but from the british point of view and it's very different [laugh] their take their take on us is very different and i'm like

127.80 129.20 A: seems to differ that way 

145.93 148.71 B: um and i'm on the east coast and it's just like 

148.88 151.08 B: this (( the view of texas )) from here it's just 

151.21 156.63 B: incredibly different it's really strange to see how these impressions can be so different 

156.52 161.61 A: well i remember when i was an exchange student i was in england again mm um

161.14 162.38 B: [noise] 

161.81 167.35 A: (( being in )) britain is such an interesting thing but i remember how 

164.30 165.61 B: [noise] 

167.60 169.82 A: everyone thought you know we were like 

170.64 172.54 A: the big soap operas 

178.95 179.73 B: uh-huh

184.85 185.67 B: [laugh] 

185.42 187.18 A: [laugh] 

186.24 195.54 B: and how many actually texans a- do that you know i lived there for eighteen years and i rode a horse maybe twice you know just a stereotype 

196.12 198.66 B: with all the reality of (( )) situation 

199.10 201.71 A: and i i think a lot of how um 

202.11 208.43 A: at least way the media is presenting international things is again through the stereotypes 

209.17 215.51 A: the- e- in as much as the whole israeli palestinian 

215.72 219.80 A: situation ah the thing with north korea 

215.82 216.29 B: mhm 

219.27 219.79 B: [breath] 

220.08 228.28 A: which [breath] e- it often just sounds like you know children who can't share their toys in a sandbox 

227.93 229.61 B: right right 

229.12 231.16 A: [laugh] i mean that sounds silly but 

231.66 234.70 A: sometimes i think of it it's like okay i feel like you know we should have a 

234.95 237.84 A: a kindergarten teacher maybe that's what the u._s. is 

238.02 238.73 B: yeah [laugh] 

238.02 239.36 A: the kindergarten teacher 

239.26 243.23 B: yeah heavily influenced by the americans though 

240.01 240.46 A: [laugh] 

242.54 244.23 A: ah yeah [breath] 

243.99 246.08 B: [laugh] and 

246.43 249.74 B: ah the whole stereotype thing still gets me um 

249.96 252.60 B: i'm really surprised on how well we um 

253.00 254.49 B: recovered from the whole 

254.81 256.66 B: you know nine eleven scare and um 

256.80 264.54 B: how we just automatically you know pointed the finger at anyone who looked of you know middle eastern descent i'm just surprised that that has i mean 

264.75 267.95 B: for the most part i've noticed that it's pretty much gone away any everyone's pretty 

268.21 269.07 B: much gained an 

269.57 272.50 B: understanding that not all people of that 

272.63 273.39 B: culture 

273.72 277.68 B: terrorists you know and it's i mean it's a really horrible thing that went on but i'm i'm 

277.81 278.89 B: actually surprised that 

279.15 283.74 B: you know americans as i hate to say it as ignorant as we are 

283.98 286.31 B: learned that and moved on from that 

285.98 291.31 A: ah so am i i mean i used to work literally blocks away from nine ele- where nine eleven happened 

291.42 291.96 B: really 

291.93 292.64 A: and 

293.72 295.48 A: that to me was just 

295.79 302.76 A: you know i mean i remember watching it and going wait a minute nothing i remembered is the same anymore and 

302.18 302.64 B: right 

303.63 306.15 A: i've talked to a very good friend of mine who lives in 

306.36 313.09 A: california and she was saying (( )) sometimes her view of world events is skewed because of that 

313.23 315.03 A: you know because things are different 

315.24 317.40 A: but yet in some ways they're the same 

317.91 318.37 B: right 

317.94 318.22 A: right 

318.60 321.51 A: i mean i there's lots of things that i don't see having changed 

322.73 323.11 A: but 

323.85 325.89 B: you mean as you know countries 

326.11 326.84 A: well i i 

326.50 327.18 B: (( )) 

327.37 330.68 A: i see it from a point of view of um 

332.65 334.29 A: life has gone on 

334.69 341.73 A: and i think we should be more vigilant for certain things because we were kind of naive to thing that terrorist wouldn't happen here 

342.20 342.81 B: right 

342.97 344.92 A: but at the same time 

346.69 347.94 A: i 

348.65 349.21 A: don't 

349.68 353.73 A: i i see us i see at least the government acting as a war monger 

354.67 356.64 A: looking for looking for a fight 

354.87 355.33 B: right 

356.50 359.96 B: i i see that too and um 

361.02 367.22 B: huh and i kind of agree with you that we should be more vigilant about some things and you know people have pretty much got over it and um 

367.39 372.59 B: it's amazing how far we have come but um i mean have you been to the ground zero site since it happened? 

372.50 377.53 A: no i have not i've not been back to new york since i moved to the midwest about 

377.92 379.85 A: two years two and a half years ago 

379.69 380.70 B: oh really 

380.44 381.10 A: um 

380.80 387.97 B: ah it's just something else to be over there and like you just there's nothing there you know but you just feel it all over again it's just 

388.19 393.89 B: incredible touching to go and just you know very very emotional experience 

394.03 398.64 A: ah i can imagine m- i i know people who have gone um 

398.75 399.83 A: i worked ah

403.97 404.36 B: mhm

412.12 412.48 A: oh

418.68 419.08 B: right 

419.42 419.69 A: m-

435.69 436.80 A: that's a 

436.91 441.01 A: different point of view [laugh] you know it's like 

439.45 440.02 B: yeah 

441.29 442.98 A: it's the absence of something 

452.27 452.67 B: and 

453.02 457.72 B: it just it seemed like something was missing you know it doesn't seem like new york anymore because you don't 

457.88 459.77 B: look at the twin towers every time you 

460.13 462.66 B: you know turn around it's just it's

472.33 472.75 A: a-

483.32 483.67 B: uh-huh

489.23 491.67 A: and i've seen pictures of what happened before 

492.29 497.17 A: and you know what it looked like before you know what it looked like as an ordinary city 

497.29 498.46 A: and 

498.57 499.35 A: you look 

500.59 505.21 A: and i can only imagine for some of the people who were there not too long afterwards

509.78 510.42 A: um 

510.83 513.47 A: you know that sense of it's not the same
