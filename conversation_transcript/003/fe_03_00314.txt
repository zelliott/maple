32.12 33.89 B: so what are we supposed to talk about 

34.33 35.42 A: bioterrorism 

35.77 36.33 B: oh so 

36.56 37.88 B: what do you think could be 

38.27 39.55 B: done to prevent it 

40.38 41.01 A: uh 

41.81 46.41 A: that i have no idea i mean i would think the only thing you could do is be defensive 

46.95 47.51 B: yeah 

47.52 49.31 A: and have people inoculated 

50.19 51.97 A: i mean ho- how would you 

52.67 53.80 A: unless they know 

54.26 54.68 A: what 

55.67 58.91 A: different terrorist groups have different things but i don't see how they 

59.17 59.71 A: (( )) 

60.89 61.42 B: yeah but 

61.57 62.26 B: i don't know 

62.84 63.62 B: maybe the 

64.52 67.80 B: borders or customs they could be more careful with it 

69.08 72.99 A: yeah i don't it just seems difficult because they could send things in the mail 

72.98 73.56 B: yeah 

74.03 77.33 A: um they could carry it across they could 

78.32 79.33 A: i don't know like 

79.47 80.26 A: for certain 

80.43 82.54 A: things i think you need such a small amount 

85.28 85.99 B: yeah it's like 

86.17 88.21 B: first of all there's like the anthrax thing that's 

88.65 90.08 B: that's like in-preventable 

90.54 90.99 A: yeah 

91.50 92.87 A: and i don't know if they ever 

93.01 94.59 A: i don't they never figure out 

95.38 96.65 A: where it came from right 

97.13 97.41 B: i don't 

98.64 99.01 A: yeah 

101.34 103.03 A: except that they think it's domestic 

104.28 106.27 A: so if they can't figure out where it came from then 

106.72 107.49 A: inside the united 

107.61 108.51 A: states 

109.98 110.33 B: yeah 

111.01 113.57 B: maybe the little thing they could do because 

113.75 115.87 B: i bet there are still a lot of people that 

116.40 118.28 B: are totally ignorant about 

118.48 118.89 B: this whole 

119.15 120.99 B: biochemical terrorism problem 

125.70 128.26 A: yeah i mean i think you definitely would have to 

129.26 129.65 A: um 

131.51 133.15 A: educate people because they have to 

133.32 134.38 A: to know to go 

134.23 134.89 B: to know what 

135.08 136.42 B: what is actually going on 

136.74 137.09 A: right 

137.19 138.71 A: and decide whether they're going to get 

140.42 140.92 B: or just 

141.49 143.17 B: be more careful in general 

145.00 145.69 B: things 

146.07 148.14 A: i guess it just seems difficult 

149.40 151.64 A: because some things can be passed just like 

152.04 155.27 A: breathing around people that have what's it small pox 

158.02 159.25 A: it's airborne i think 

160.43 160.83 B: or 

161.36 162.24 B: yeah m- because 

162.41 164.87 B: i'm no scientist or anything but maybe they could 

167.86 168.37 A: yeah 

169.59 171.69 A: definitely like i definitely think they know 

172.42 173.56 A: certain um 

174.91 176.25 A: certain viruses 

176.50 178.67 A: or whatever that terrorists would be interested in 

176.56 176.99 B: yeah 

179.05 180.44 B: yeah but i bet they're just 

180.67 182.40 B: so many viruses that 

182.69 182.95 B: can't 

183.59 184.04 B: find 

184.15 186.14 B: anti viruses for all of them 

186.06 187.68 A: right but there's certain strains that 

187.86 188.68 A: that would 

189.52 190.09 A: um 

190.54 191.30 A: infect 

191.39 192.78 A: people easily and quickly 

192.91 193.41 B: mhm 

193.63 194.84 A: and travel easily 

194.76 195.29 B: yeah 

194.93 196.85 A: and only require small amount 

196.96 197.39 B: yeah 

197.51 198.46 A: to like really 

198.99 202.38 A: make people very sick or kill them so they would be interested in 

200.29 200.75 B: yeah 

201.19 201.59 B: yeah 

202.89 204.37 A: certain viruses or certain 

204.81 206.00 A: bacteria 

205.90 206.30 B: yeah 

207.00 208.96 A: like anthrax in particular 

209.82 210.36 A: was one 

211.89 212.71 B: yeah maybe they got 

213.09 216.06 B: even invest more in the whole medical system so 

217.10 218.04 B: so that (( )) 

218.73 219.10 B: (( )) 

219.36 220.57 B: get infected they would be 

221.29 222.33 B: easier to cure 

222.44 224.88 A: right right and people would definitely like with anthrax 

223.50 223.87 B: quicker 

224.98 227.66 A: anthrax they were they kept telling people 

228.19 229.21 A: what the symptoms were 

229.23 229.68 B: yeah 

229.94 231.71 A: and if you feel like this go 

232.42 234.53 A: go to the hospital go to your doctor immediately 

234.63 238.99 B: (( )) i for one am not very sure about what the symptoms are so 

239.29 241.40 A: well the problem i think was is that um 

241.78 243.49 A: they are very similar to a common cold 

243.35 243.79 B: yeah 

244.57 245.35 A: so 

246.43 247.08 B: like uh 

246.57 246.90 A: they 

248.11 249.13 B: i bet anyone wouldn't 

249.24 251.74 B: wouldn't go to the hospital for just a cold 

251.87 255.82 A: right right but they were saying if you work in certain areas 

256.16 257.84 A: like where you're exposed to 

258.63 258.99 A: especially 

259.16 260.09 A: postal workers 

260.87 261.36 A: and stuff 

262.20 264.63 A: or if you see evidence of like a white powder 

264.90 267.34 A: or and you have a cold and all these things 

268.74 269.47 B: well (( )) 

270.35 274.35 B: for me personally i wouldn't want to go to the hospital because it's just so inconvenient 

274.41 275.54 A: oh exactly 

275.49 276.40 B: and so yeah 

276.52 277.18 B: there's always a 

277.42 279.59 B: big line up that just holds up too much time 

280.33 280.81 A: yeah 

281.62 283.17 A: but if you would thi- if 

283.45 287.29 A: if you had any idea that you might have been exposed to something you would go you would go 

285.99 286.24 B: yeah 

288.16 288.67 B: (( of course )) yeah 

293.20 293.94 B: eh 

293.97 294.85 A: but i don't know i'm not 

295.51 297.10 A: i'm not too worried although i don't 

297.44 299.69 A: i was never vaccinated for small pox 

299.86 300.69 B: yeah 

302.38 302.86 B: yeah 

303.29 303.69 B: because 

304.19 306.45 B: i don't think anybody is too worried that 

307.79 308.97 B: might be the problem 

309.16 309.57 A: yeah 

309.50 309.90 B: because it 

310.50 311.19 B: problem might be like 

311.45 312.14 B: bigger than 

313.80 314.30 A: mhm 

315.04 317.17 A: well i guess i think the possibility is there 

321.18 323.44 A: but yeah i mean unless someone says to me 

324.33 326.01 A: uh besides small pox what 

327.98 330.49 A: what things i should be inoculated for i wouldn't know 

330.81 331.25 B: yeah 

337.55 339.28 A: i don't know m- i don't know too much about it 

339.41 339.83 B: yeah 

340.01 340.77 B: me neither 

343.04 343.52 B: anyways are 

343.75 344.36 B: are you 

344.83 346.70 B: are you a student or you're working 

346.92 347.39 A: working 

347.50 348.06 B: working 

348.17 348.45 B: really 

348.56 349.00 B: where at 

349.82 350.80 A: uh i work at penn 

351.18 351.61 B: oh really 

352.38 353.43 B: s- u. penn or 

353.77 354.37 A: yeah u. penn 

354.73 355.73 B: oh really what do you do 

358.05 360.00 B: are we not supposed to talk about this stuff 

359.76 360.36 A: i don't know 

361.08 361.34 A: but 

364.68 365.01 A: i think 

369.03 371.33 A: we're supposed to talk for ten minutes about bioterrorism right 

371.47 371.92 B: oh really 

372.25 374.31 B: h- how much have we gone for 

374.45 376.23 A: i think maybe three of four 

377.82 379.03 B: crap 

379.60 381.47 B: uh 

382.31 383.01 B: (( )) 

383.16 383.93 B: how many 

384.13 385.73 B: kinds of like those 

385.96 388.00 B: bi- biological viruses 

388.10 389.23 B: are you aware of 

390.31 392.18 A: n- not many i mean just 

392.56 393.27 A: a few like 

393.32 394.65 B: anthrax for one yeah 

394.77 396.50 A: right and most of the things that 

397.15 399.77 A: i mean i guess they could use things that we've 

400.24 402.17 A: uh wiped out like polio 

403.63 404.17 A: um 

404.62 405.85 A: or other viruses that 

406.36 407.25 A: spread really fast 

409.69 411.70 A: but the only yeah polio was one 

417.07 417.80 B: are you 

417.09 417.35 A: thing 

417.93 421.44 B: are you who (( personally )) one of those who encourage them do you just like 

422.56 426.55 B: go go go like seize (( )) and just get rid of them or 

427.11 428.04 B: you don't want war 

429.42 430.26 A: wait say that again 

430.30 431.04 B: are you f- 

431.17 433.90 B: are you like one of those who encourages war 

434.95 435.53 B: and just like 

435.70 436.49 B: end this whole 

441.11 442.85 A: well i think it i- 

442.98 444.51 A: that's a difficult thing because 

444.15 444.51 B: yeah 

445.49 449.24 A: it depends on the situation and i don't think that american public 

449.47 450.11 A: really 

450.68 451.94 A: has enough information 

452.03 452.73 B: yeah that's 

452.98 453.85 B: the other thing like 

454.03 459.47 A: and but then the thing is that you have to trust that the people that are making those decisions have enough information 

461.15 461.65 A: um 

463.63 464.23 A: i don't know 

464.23 467.88 B: well eh was it t- because i heard about a week ago that 

468.41 470.19 B: (( )) released that whole list of 

470.47 472.07 B: bio chemical weapons that he has 

472.57 474.79 B: and the whole thing is like ten thousand pages 

475.60 476.20 A: yeah 

476.63 477.15 B: it's true 

477.78 479.95 A: oh the mean from the documents from iraq 

480.16 480.49 B: yeah 

481.24 483.90 A: i know that it's something like two suitcases full 

484.34 484.85 B: oh really 

485.16 485.63 A: well what's 

485.82 489.64 A: in it exactly i don't know i mean i'm sure that they have a lot of 

489.89 490.98 A: biological weapons 

491.35 491.70 B: yeah 

491.72 492.77 A: and a lot of other things 

493.13 493.94 B: yeah 

494.88 495.50 A: um 

495.16 495.45 B: k- 

496.05 496.71 B: kind of freaky 

497.16 498.17 A: i doubt that 

498.81 501.44 A: i mean they were producing them before and and there's lots of 

501.93 502.81 A: information 

503.53 506.60 A: prior to all this about what they were purchasing from different countries 

507.49 509.42 A: so i doubt that they didn't do anything with it 

509.76 510.62 B: yeah probably 

511.28 513.02 A: i mean i they're not going to just say oh 

513.32 515.56 A: the u._n. told us this or that and 

515.95 516.98 A: so we're going to do it 

517.83 519.50 B: (( just thought )) it would be nice to know what 

519.60 520.88 B: what is actually going on 

521.22 522.33 A: yeah 

524.91 525.28 B: when 

525.49 526.29 B: we're the one that 

526.42 529.08 B: that would be inf- like affected by it the whole 

529.64 530.06 B: (( )) 

530.63 532.17 A: well i think a lot of people would be 

534.26 538.40 B: the other reason i understand why they wouldn't want to let that information out is 

538.61 539.24 B: because if 

540.08 543.00 B: we know too much the whole country would go in chaos
