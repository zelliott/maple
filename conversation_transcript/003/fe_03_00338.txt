76.90 78.30 B: after about 

78.44 81.46 B: let's see about eight years of it i got so sick of comic books 

81.24 81.94 A: uh-huh 

81.67 83.87 B: i got out of it i mean it you have 

83.59 84.49 A: i can imagine 

84.64 85.24 B: well you just 

85.36 87.75 B: you have people coming in and uh 

87.94 90.08 B: it's like you know d. and d. types right 

90.75 91.22 A: no 

91.21 92.34 B: dungeons and dragons 

92.92 93.72 A: oh oh yeah 

93.79 95.44 B: okay and they'll come in and 

95.78 96.54 B: and um 

104.61 106.48 B: really happened and it's like 

106.66 108.06 B: okay you're thinking to yourself 

108.17 111.27 B: get a life right there's more to the world 

109.76 112.34 A: and you can't say anything 

111.91 115.63 B: oh well yeah i mean you know this is your customer base and you're you're looking for some 

115.75 116.53 B: excuse to 

116.66 122.77 B: to talk to somebody else get out of that conversation i eventually cultivated a group of 

123.24 124.91 B: chess players and uh 

125.76 127.71 B: i used the chess players to uh 

129.30 132.79 B: come in and you know they were something that would guard me against the more 

133.03 133.57 B: geeky 

134.09 134.54 B: uh 

134.67 135.13 B: types 

135.75 136.39 A: i got you 

135.92 137.28 B: understand what i mean 

137.18 137.87 A: yeah yeah 

137.83 139.76 B: yeah because it what you're just out of high school 

140.54 142.18 A: oh yeah i'm in college right now 

142.21 142.72 B: right but 

142.52 143.06 A: so 

142.93 148.07 B: but that was my whole point is you still remember the geek (( )) types when you were in high school okay 

144.82 145.14 A: yeah 

146.55 147.21 A: yes yeah 

147.79 148.44 A: definitely 

148.37 149.26 B: yes well 

149.61 150.87 B: cool but anyway 

150.64 151.02 A: yeah 

151.24 151.62 B: so 

151.37 155.40 A: i don't know if it would be a good idea to open a business though just because i'm not really 

155.75 159.39 A: the really ambitious type like i wouldn't have a problem working for somebody else 

159.99 164.91 A: so even if i had enough money to open a business i'm not sure that it would be successful 

165.19 165.65 B: uh well 

165.40 167.06 A: because of that so 

167.30 170.03 B: that that this will tell you um whether 

170.33 171.46 B: you would be good is 

172.03 172.47 B: um 

173.45 176.33 B: it it all comes down to what they call a self starter 

177.00 177.43 A: uh-huh 

177.00 181.37 B: uh um and that means can you get up and do it on your own 

181.48 182.01 B: um like 

182.11 183.54 B: you go to college now right 

183.74 184.18 A: right 

184.09 189.42 B: all of the suddenly you're not forced to go to class now do you make it to every class 

190.85 194.67 A: well yeah but the motivation is a little different i'd say 

193.47 193.99 B: uh 

194.27 198.06 B: well yeah y- uh you seem to think that but see actually owning your own business 

198.58 201.62 B: i don't know have you ever had any jobs before like 

201.70 202.91 A: yeah yeah 

203.11 205.26 B: seven eleven what what kind of job was it 

203.49 203.96 A: yeah 

205.12 207.33 A: well i was a bank teller for a couple of years 

207.12 207.94 B: okay well 

208.87 209.32 B: um 

210.24 220.76 B: you how a lot of times you're think oh i got to go to work right even if it's a good job it's like see when you own your own business it's never i got to go to work it's like i get to go to work 

214.11 214.66 A: right 

221.88 223.59 B: okay uh and it it it's 

223.83 224.32 B: because 

224.94 236.62 B: it's almost like a contin- because you're totally in control so there's not going to be any jerk i mean you know there's going to be hassles and so like if you did go into to something like computer consulting and you knew it real well then 

236.40 236.72 A: right 

236.76 240.26 B: you get paid a lot of money for actually doing very little work 

240.64 243.34 B: you know something that other people don't know 

244.13 244.58 B: right 

244.70 245.75 B: you see what i'm saying 

245.87 246.49 A: right yeah 

246.47 247.38 B: and and so if 

255.34 259.03 B: how did you do how do you handle a business you you know and and i'm thinking well 

259.34 260.05 B: how do handle 

260.17 261.75 B: factory work this is like 

262.01 262.49 B: you know 

262.62 267.81 B: really boring you know i've had some pretty you know low class jobs like being a custodian or whatever but 

267.45 268.27 A: right 

268.39 272.22 B: you know the one place i wouldn't go some of my customers were like factory workers and it's like 

272.43 272.71 B: here 

272.86 274.56 B: let's make the same repetition a 

274.65 276.03 B: thousand times 

276.25 276.79 A: right 

276.79 277.67 B: do you get my point 

288.49 293.35 A: how will all that be on your shoulders as opposed to working for somewhere else where they just tell you what to do 

293.45 300.12 B: well yeah i can see i can see your point there it's the but that's what i mean it's a personality uh trait 

294.60 295.11 A: (( )) 

295.63 296.06 A: yeah 

299.30 300.08 A: yeah yeah 

300.60 301.36 B: i would rather 

301.74 305.09 B: see you know because people say it's well it seems well and actually now i'm 

305.21 310.53 B: i went back to grad school and i'm getting a p._h._d. in linguistics which is what i really wanted to do but 

307.24 307.59 A: mhm 

309.08 309.68 A: right 

310.94 311.69 A: oh that's awesome 

311.82 316.87 B: yeah well i'm i'm actually learning sherpa there's no grammar of the sherp you know what the sherpa are 

317.37 318.11 A: no i don't 

318.05 318.66 B: okay think 

318.92 323.24 B: (( )) climb mount everest you know those those oriental guys that climb 

322.87 323.33 A: yeah yeah 

323.54 323.93 B: okay 

324.30 324.94 B: the that 

325.03 336.88 B: that language has never been written in an english grammar there's very little on it but one of the tour guides married uh an american american female that comes from a family with a little bit of money well you know took a 

337.46 337.79 A: right 

338.27 341.02 B: to nepal several years about ten years ago 

348.67 351.82 B: uh marries him and then they produce children and so 

351.93 355.28 B: you know there's actually a sherpa that lives here and owns a landscaping business 

356.09 356.80 A: that's funny 

356.13 356.51 B: (( )) 

356.86 359.19 B: yeah so anyway i work with him right now but 

359.70 363.06 B: yeah you know it is a personality type thing when you uh 

363.72 365.25 B: when you do do a business 

365.73 366.23 B: um 

367.14 374.46 A: right i think some people are just the business types like i know a lot of really young people like even my age that have started businesses like a couple of girls like in my 

374.78 375.95 A: dorm actually 

376.07 379.11 A: started a business of cooking and delivering the food to people 

378.62 379.08 B: and 

379.65 380.12 B: how is 

379.69 385.06 A: and um and it's like working out well but it's so much work for them and like especially just getting started 

383.31 384.11 B: oh yeah 

385.56 387.44 A: in the beginning it's just uh tough 

388.22 395.01 B: well you that was one of problems with comic books is i would often say to my friends if there was a zero after every transaction i would probably 

395.37 397.31 B: be quite happy in this business 

398.14 399.33 B: but you know you don't really 

405.48 406.29 B: this is what i would 

406.40 411.91 B: start a retail you know a single store front retail it would be women's lingerie and jewelry 

409.23 409.61 A: uh-huh 

412.50 413.32 A: huh 

412.95 413.99 B: do you know why 

414.05 414.70 A: why 

415.03 420.31 B: because when i used to sit there and have my comic book store and you know struggle along through 

420.64 423.73 B: i would in the newspaper and i knew what the the ad rates were 

424.17 424.57 B: and 

424.76 433.81 B: the the the local jewelry and lingerie stores there was one or two of them always had very big ads every day they were spending one hundred dollars 

431.65 432.08 A: right 

433.97 441.00 B: some of them two hundred dollars well this tells me that their daily gross had to be four five thousand dollars a day right 

440.56 440.98 A: right 

441.13 450.64 B: and that (( )) and so i'm well thinking if your gross and your profit margin because i knew what that kind of stuff sold because you know i've you know like when i did flea markets and stuff you know that 

450.83 451.25 A: right 

450.86 454.71 B: eventually led to my store i you get all these catalogues on stuff 

455.37 464.51 B: and i'm thinking okay so they're these people are pulling in four thousand bucks a day minimum and i sincerely doubt that's their entire uh you know 

465.41 467.15 B: uh advertisement budget 

467.60 468.01 A: right 

467.62 472.43 B: you know and the rule of thu- thumb is no more than five percent of of your gross goes 

472.62 473.66 B: and so it's like 

474.04 474.70 B: okay 

483.45 485.37 B: that was must be one of the the the best 

485.55 486.09 B: businesses 

486.18 486.84 B: to be in 

488.33 488.78 A: right 

489.02 491.03 A: probably like i think women 

491.61 494.53 A: spend a whole lot of money on lingerie and jewelry (( i don't know why )) 

494.00 496.30 B: well yeah they do but the the the point is is 

496.59 496.97 B: this 

497.14 497.79 B: this went 

497.94 504.43 B: from anything else it's just i had this very objective measure that would stare me in the face every day 

504.84 514.10 B: you know while i'm sitting there struggling on an on a much uh smaller amount of money and having you what i mean you know if you had uh if i had a store like that kind of gross 

514.20 516.07 B: then you know i could hire 

520.79 521.21 A: right 

523.70 523.97 B: and 

524.08 529.75 B: i don't even have to know anything about fashion i don't have to know anything about lingerie i don't even have to be there 

528.48 528.97 A: right 

530.00 531.87 B: and yet i get most of the benefit 

532.46 533.03 A: that's true 

535.28 535.74 B: but in a 

535.44 536.94 A: so why didn't you decide to do that 

537.55 538.04 B: um 

539.10 543.55 B: because then i decided to be a high school teacher and i really hated it i went back 

543.70 548.24 B: to school and and i got in and i understand why public education is 

548.47 551.65 B: so goofed up but i'm really am a good teacher because 

552.11 554.30 B: i came to the university uh 

555.66 557.35 B: four and a half years ago 

557.89 566.14 B: and uh because i was older they wouldn't give me a fellowship even though i got i have real high g._r._e. scores that's you know that's like an s._a._t. for grad school 

563.65 564.00 A: mhm
