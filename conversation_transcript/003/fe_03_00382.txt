24.03 25.01 B: mhm 

24.79 30.24 A: i was also there for the gulf war so a little different view than most people you know that are 

30.27 31.92 A: taking part in this 

31.80 34.62 B: um is it are you ethnically arabic 

34.40 40.15 A: no i'm not actually ah i'm asian my parents are just pretty much engineers of the oil company there 

38.64 39.22 B: (( mm )) 

39.51 41.86 B: that's right you're from india right [noise] [noise] 

41.74 45.30 A: no no no i'm from i'm from my parents are from the phillipines 

45.04 46.69 B: oh from the phillipines okay

50.94 53.75 B: well actually i i happen to be jewish um 

53.13 53.80 A: mhm 

53.99 62.25 B: but um no i have several friends who um were um indian [noise] ah from [noise] actually they were from forgive me let me 

63.07 66.10 B: [noise] i know this phone is kind of quirky i'm sorry for the um 

66.41 67.63 A: (( ah no problem )) 

66.72 81.27 B: the blips here we go [noise] [noise] um but i have some some friends who are from ah ah bengal who ah worked in actually not saudi arabia but uh yemen and um their their parents were engineers working for the oil industry 

81.41 82.31 A: mhm 

82.08 85.34 B: and i know that that's common for like non 

86.07 86.87 A: (( mhm )) 

86.23 88.79 B: nationals to go and work there 

86.95 87.68 A: (( [noise] )) 

88.52 90.97 A: exactly well i mean the thing that is interesting is that 

91.00 94.74 A: it seems that the hatred is bred almost at the very beginning 

94.68 106.73 A: and even not towards arab nationals i know when i went to school there um we'd get maps you know sent in from the united states and instead of israel they'd have something crossed out and palestine written in magic marker 

106.63 107.48 B: uh-huh 

107.20 110.92 A: over things like that i mean it's hard to break that cycle 

110.98 113.65 B: so wait hatred when you say hatred what do you mean 

113.64 122.96 A: i mean not necessarily outright hatred as in like there's propaganda being shouted on the streets you know we must take back the holy land or whatever but things like small things like not even recognizing 

114.07 115.05 B: hatred 

118.41 119.33 B: mhm 

123.03 125.15 A: the the term israel 

124.82 125.80 B: mhm 

125.21 129.69 A: for example um i don't know how it is on the other side but i know 

129.86 136.21 A: the biggest challenge to you know when to break the hatred is you know is to ah basically start at a younger age i mean 

136.01 136.58 B: (( [noise] )) 

136.45 144.23 A: it's tough to say that if you want to give up on the older generations but i think that's in in all reality that's what you'd have to do 

144.63 147.39 A: if there ever was a resolution to be met 

148.34 150.50 B: um so you're saying ah 

151.39 152.41 B: if we 

152.51 155.38 B: stopped teaching kids to hate 

155.31 156.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

155.95 158.10 B: um then ah 

158.48 164.97 B: right that would help um alleviate s- ah a lot of the tension in the middle east is what you're saying 

164.74 165.68 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

166.11 167.58 B: [mn] uh-huh okay 

167.50 174.28 A: well i mean i think also especially with iraq right now there's some issues with governments not 

174.60 177.50 A: necessarily representing the ah will of the people 

178.92 180.11 B: right 

180.38 184.02 B: sure but i mean i i i mean i kind of feel like um 

184.13 193.36 B: the government the current u._s. government is not representing the will of the people i mean it's first of all it's a totally illegitimate government they weren't even el- bush wasn't even elected 

191.71 194.89 A: (( um )) 

193.56 194.46 B: you know 

194.99 201.27 B: i mean it's a crime against the american people that this schmuck is is in office right 

199.68 200.70 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

201.25 202.77 A: (( yeah he )) 

201.78 206.06 B: i mean talk about talk about defrauding the american people 

206.05 207.01 A: mhm 

207.46 213.94 A: so obviously it'd be safe to say you aren't exactly in line with what what bush's policies w- in the middle east are right now 

213.66 217.96 B: ah yeah you could you could say that you could say that [laughter] 

214.32 215.40 A: or his 

217.04 219.50 A: [laughter] or it could be spun so many different ways 

219.57 224.55 A: um what what about the current stance with ah the u._s. backing the israeli army 

219.78 220.61 B: (( 'scuse me )) 

224.91 231.75 B: oh i mean they've been doing it for decades right um actually i think they really started doing it the nineteen sixties 

227.35 228.24 A: mhm 

231.56 234.51 A: exactly yeah if my history serves me correctly 

231.78 233.52 B: um an- 

234.28 235.39 B: (( excuse me [noise] )) 

235.04 237.51 A: if my history's cor- i think that you're right yeah 

236.12 238.10 B: right [noise] mine too 

238.17 251.40 B: [noise] um it was really in the nineteen sixties ah that they started pouring money into um their military and i think if they just turned off that faucet then actually you [laughter] would probably achieve some [sigh] you might achieve some peace in the middle east 

251.40 254.21 B: m- m- by turning off the faucet i mean you know 

251.72 252.88 A: (( oh uh )) 

254.27 265.33 B: if they if they stop if americans stopped funding um ah the israeli occupation ah ah of the palestinian people then 

257.57 258.52 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

266.11 268.31 B: um then then it would stop 

266.23 268.02 A: yeah i mean i think that's interesting 

268.39 273.22 A: but in a sense um that's kind of what britain did you know back 

273.25 275.13 A: post world war two when 

275.24 279.88 A: they kind of just turned their back on both peoples and let them try to try to decide it on their own 

280.12 283.55 B: well i mean they have a right to decide it on their own right 

280.38 281.16 A: (( ah )) 

282.92 286.44 A: mhm well i mean but there's a case then of just 

286.86 292.64 A: israel having so much more of a powerful army but at the same time being surrounded by hostile environment like a hostile 

292.08 295.97 B: [noise] well yeah but they made the environment more hostile right by 

296.06 299.38 B: by um you know i mean their colonial power 

299.30 300.30 A: mhm 

300.73 302.21 A: i mean my fear is that 

301.19 303.43 B: and a nuclear power [laughter] [sigh] 

302.78 310.37 A: exactly which is all the more scary i mean my fear is that if you left something like that if the u._s. were to completely pull out without 

309.53 310.30 B: uh-huh 

310.42 317.09 A: set guidelines without treaties between the two nations um or even establishing the two nations in each others eyes something like 

317.19 325.43 A: israel i mean not israel i'm sorry ah india or pakistan would emerge so you'd have um you know just wide scale massacres i mean 

326.26 327.74 A: it's odd to see that 

327.75 338.08 A: like a people that you normally just w- call friends in an everyday mode um the hatred that lies underneath that when it comes to fighting for land that's been in dis- that's been disputed for generations 

338.19 346.71 B: right but i mean what we're engaged in now isn't doing anything to stop that right and it's time to try a different course 

343.74 345.90 A: mhm exactly i agree with that 

346.70 354.41 B: you know um and i would like to see what would happen i mean we don't know what would happen if um um 

347.59 348.41 A: uh-huh 

354.70 359.72 B: [noise] the united states stopped funding israeli state terrorism right 

358.95 360.61 A: mhm exactly 

359.80 363.26 B: um we don't know what would happen but it would be interesting to see 

364.70 367.20 A: yeah i mean it i could really 

366.07 369.38 B: i mean what- whatever's going on now certainly isn't working 

368.56 371.02 A: [laughter] exactly but 

371.25 378.40 A: i don't know there seems to be some responsibility i mean do you agree with the statement that the u._s. as a world power has a responsibility to other nations 

379.31 380.70 B: um 

381.92 382.48 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

383.43 396.53 B: well a certain kind of responsibility to i guess defend nations that are that are in trouble right um but um but that's not what the u._s. is doing right 

389.71 391.41 A: mhm yeah 

396.19 398.94 A: mm 

396.71 400.56 B: i mean in principle sure i agree with that statement of course who wouldn't 

400.37 409.02 B: but that's not actually what's going on i mean you know the united states doesn't support democracy anywhere it didn't support democracy in guatemala 

408.83 416.68 B: or chile or iran [laughter] or vietnam or any of those places right why you know 

408.96 409.69 A: mhm 

411.72 414.12 A: yeah i mean i agree with you [laughter] 

415.30 416.27 A: (( yeah )) 

416.63 423.34 A: self interest is more of the motivating factor than uh you know almost a big brother type mentality in international diplomacy 

423.50 427.15 A: is that would you say that statement's fair in terms of for the u._s. 

427.81 431.06 A: that they're serving themselves more than serving other people 

430.72 434.05 B: oh that's for sure and they're not even serving themsel- w- 

434.14 445.15 B: it's only a certain group of people serving themselves right i mean i don't think the american government does a very good job of serving the most american people right they serve a certain class of american people 

445.38 446.87 B: but um 

445.56 448.39 A: and this administration more so than 

448.60 451.77 B: m- possibly i don't know but i mean the last administration 

451.78 462.81 B: um you know the the clinton administration is the one that instituted welfare reform which is probably the cruelest meanest thing you could possibly do to poor women and children in this country 

457.41 458.33 A: mhm 

463.11 464.04 A: yeah 

463.50 468.23 B: whereas really i mean it was just it's [mn] evil it's just and and stupid 

468.49 469.75 B: um 

470.33 472.37 B: um it was a terrible thing to do 

472.41 473.68 B: and 

473.88 474.75 B: you know 

475.23 476.24 B: i guess 

476.71 479.28 B: somehow clinton you know because 

479.36 484.94 B: he's he seems like a charming guy got away with it i don't know how he got away with it 

484.68 486.04 A: [laughter] 

485.22 486.45 B: but he did 

487.44 494.76 A: yeah i mean i think in my personal opinion i think the u._s. should stop dealing with international politics so closely 

495.35 496.32 B: mhm 

495.59 497.70 A: um but then again 

497.71 500.75 A: it's too hard to do that in a world where everything's interconnected 

500.66 502.45 B: well that's true yeah 

502.65 506.40 B: sure um yeah 

507.14 510.13 A: mm so [noise] what else 

508.51 509.23 B: i 

509.32 511.66 B: guess though um 

512.04 513.30 B: well how 

514.71 517.67 B: how do you think that the u._s. could possibly 

517.71 520.78 B: deal with other nations in a way that is more fair 

521.74 522.79 A: (( ah )) 

523.18 531.71 A: i think in terms of that i think they should listen to other nations more closely rather than like it almost seems like they don't care what other people think 

527.94 528.84 B: mhm 

531.14 533.18 B: right yeah [laughter] 

532.37 537.67 A: um [laughter] i always think it's funny whenever people m- mention nato or the united nations 

537.45 538.28 B: yeah 

537.72 542.22 A: and the fact that sometimes it's just the puppets of the u._s. volition 

542.41 545.19 A: um and i think that's 

545.90 554.42 A: i mean not to make a big generalization but the u._s. mentality as a whole is very this is what's right because we're doing it 

553.92 555.31 B: right mhm 

554.43 559.42 A: um and in a sense i think september eleventh 

559.47 560.93 A: could've been a nice 

561.07 564.47 A: slap in the face if it were spun the proper way 

564.56 571.08 A: um it i mean this is a very very minority view and i'm not sure if i fully agree with it but 

564.96 566.02 B: (( how so )) 

572.54 579.63 A: [noise] rather than being so patriotic in response to september eleventh i think it's also important to understand why these people did what they did 

578.97 582.32 B: [noise] oh sure yeah i agr- i would agree with that yeah mhm 

580.65 589.41 A: um like i remember during the gulf war where we had u._s. bases pretty much full scale operations 

589.33 599.89 A: um and some of things that would happen in terms of just treating the soldiers there i mean sure they're actually there to protect saudis the saudi nationals ah from you know from saddam overrunning but
