0.28 1.52 A: hello 

1.56 3.21 A: ah my name is dacna 

3.03 4.89 B: hi my name is jason 

5.04 6.42 A: and 

6.48 7.80 A: so what do you think 

7.95 12.07 B: i think computers in education's a very good idea i think it gives a much more 

8.02 9.00 A: do you think 

12.23 16.30 B: ah dynamic and visual learning feel 

16.37 23.08 A: but don't you think that there's also a a negative side to computers in education because 

23.05 32.21 A: if all the effort goes into um how cool everything looks and [lipsmack] how um 

32.24 33.42 B: do they get away from 

32.27 46.13 A: interesting it will be then people don't have any time to i mean or at least less time to pay attention to content and then there's the problem because you ah don't get as much content as you would 

45.95 47.34 A: if um 

47.60 48.52 A: (( you p- )) 

47.61 50.79 B: i think it's i think it's a great tool in addition to 

51.53 54.51 B: you know the the standard 

54.63 56.33 B: way you educate now 

56.40 63.66 B: i think it's it's it should be used supplementary but not as you know only as the single purpose for education 

64.03 67.53 A: so do you think it should start from say 

67.84 69.59 A: um kindergarten 

70.13 71.06 B: um 

71.55 72.55 B: i think 

71.71 73.69 A: or elementary school or 

73.07 74.84 B: i think getting 

75.06 89.94 B: kids used to just the whole not you know just getting used to how a computer works young is good because they're becoming more and more prevalent in society but i would wouldn't say 

88.27 96.96 A: right but do you really need school to do that because if you look at kids today they know i don't know by the time they're seven or something like this 

96.84 97.74 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

96.90 111.03 A: they know so much about how to use computers just from the fact that they have computers at home that their parents um let them play with the computers and there are all these you know education software that they get at home anyway if they 

111.36 121.52 A: if you know if they have a computer which of course brings us to the point that not everybody would have access to computers if you didn't have this in education so i guess i accept your 

122.08 132.61 B: yeah i think i think it's a i think it's a good supplementary tool i don't think it's a substitute for teachers or for good old fashioned note taking or anything like that 

122.12 123.04 A: yeah 

132.40 135.63 A: so in what subjects can you use it do you think 

135.01 135.94 B: um 

136.68 137.55 B: i think 

137.79 143.60 B: i think earlier you would use it more interactively you know to show 

145.36 148.85 B: to show stuff you know to you know to maybe 

146.64 147.62 A: mhm 

149.02 159.19 B: take take the chalk out of the teacher's hand so he can walk around you know so he doesn't have to sit there and write on the board but he can walk around and do stuff like that but 

155.49 156.55 A: mhm 

160.20 164.32 B: it i think it should be mo- used more interactively more just graphically 

164.63 170.29 B: at at the younger ages and as the as you get older more as a research tool 

170.15 175.85 A: [noise] [noise] so in the younger age would you teach them i don't know spelling 

175.90 188.81 A: or math i mean when i was when i was over in elementary school we had computers and we used them to do math and it was all sorts of games um associated with it so you had some you know 

189.08 202.75 A: multiplication addition whatever but you also had little games where you you have a bunny and the faster you add the faster your bunny moves or things like this and this was quite fun so i agree this is a 

191.11 192.00 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

202.65 205.06 B: yeah any way to any way that to 

205.09 210.50 B: to get a a child kid adult young adult more 

211.31 213.67 B: interested you know 

213.24 213.81 A: (( [noise] )) 

214.08 214.95 B: (( 'cause ah )) 

215.95 221.17 B: learning in general isn't always the most fun thing especially if it's a subject you're not into 

221.20 227.24 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] right yeah like english spelling for instance right [laughter] 

221.81 222.92 B: so 

222.95 226.05 B: i i mean you can't say well i think yeah 

226.12 229.16 B: i wouldn't i wouldn't say that you know oh you 

229.35 235.22 B: know only you know only educate in the kids in what in the subjects they don't like with computers but in in the senses 

235.67 236.46 B: of 

236.55 239.37 B: you know maybe one day a week you do 

239.54 241.60 B: a full class of 

241.61 249.39 B: you know whatever geography in in computer you know using computers to help [lipsmack] to help you get into it a little bit more 

248.82 257.47 A: but i think that basically means that i mean you need to have good software right and in order to develop good software you need to invest a lot of money 

253.62 254.75 B: oh yeah 

257.38 265.06 A: so um that means that the same software would have to be used all over i don't know the country or each state or 

264.02 269.55 B: there'd have to be some kind of standardization of you know it wouldn't have to be the same exact software but just the same 

265.91 267.03 A: yeah 

270.32 278.34 A: [noise] oh if it's [mn] my point is that if it's not the sa- exact same software then nobody will develop this kind of software because it's not going to be 

278.41 280.76 A: they're not going to see any profit on it 

280.13 282.52 B: [noise] true true that's a good point 

281.23 292.60 A: and this means in in turn that i mean if you want to like have i don't know you have three geography classes a week geography's actually a good a good example for something you can use computers to 

292.48 294.25 B: mhm 

292.67 293.72 A: um 

294.15 306.05 A: but ah if you have three geography classes a week and one of them you do with the whatever software um you know you can buy from whoever who develops it then 

306.56 307.89 A: that means 

308.01 321.55 A: it has i mean this really in- invades everything you you do about um teaching geography [noise] because if it's like one class a week it has to be completely interrelated with what you're teaching when you're you know teaching 

320.17 328.45 B: [noise] [noise] yeah it would have to go along with your your lesson plan your text book whatever you know chapter one you you know you do this lesson or whatever 

325.07 325.95 A: right 

328.09 329.41 A: mhm 

329.57 331.68 A: and do you think it can work 

331.86 337.30 B: do i think it could work i think it works i think it can work i mean it's they're using it today 

332.14 334.56 A: i mean yeah i mean for from 

334.58 335.35 A: from 

337.26 341.87 A: did you have computers when you were at like i don't know in elementary school or in high 

341.19 346.78 B: no i didn't my first computer interaction wasn't until probably like my 

347.16 349.57 B: my la- eighth grade or so 

350.02 351.90 A: school [mn] in school or in general 

351.67 355.83 B: in actually in school or in general i'm sorry in general but it was in school 

356.01 358.75 A: okay so you're first computer interaction was in school 

358.70 359.93 B: yeah 

359.04 361.84 A: interesting and what subject was it in or 

361.54 364.19 B: it was computer class it was 

363.21 365.09 A: oh and what were you 

364.31 367.78 B: it was eighth grade it was you know i think it was a standard class ah 

367.91 369.93 B: everybody had to take it it was just a 

370.09 378.16 B: computer you know intro to computers type class this is how you turn 'em on here's a fun little game you can play you know stuff like that 

374.20 375.15 A: [laughter] 

375.96 377.21 A: right 

377.56 378.79 A: ha okay 

380.52 381.71 A: that's interesting 

381.98 389.77 A: because my first interaction with a computer was in also in school and also in a computer class 

389.63 394.61 A: but at the same time i had these as i told you before um math classes 

393.93 395.75 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

394.42 406.72 A: and so we had math i think four hours a week or whatever and on fridays we als- always had math in the computer lab and just had all these games and all sorts of stuff but at some point 

398.09 399.20 B: mhm 

406.53 413.37 A: it got [sigh] m- i mean it was just more of the same it w- got repetitious that it was boring 

413.26 414.32 B: yeah 

413.46 417.15 A: so this is something that should be taken into consideration 

416.96 421.48 B: yeah that can it can get just as boring as sitting in a normal classroom every day 

421.10 426.48 A: [noise] right so i guess [mn] if you want to um [lipsmack] 

422.12 423.06 B: yeah 

426.90 433.45 A: get people to actually use computers in a fruitful way in the classroom you need to invest a lot of money in that [noise] 

433.38 437.70 B: yeah it'll it it'll take money and some kind of standardization i would think 

437.72 438.61 B: (( you know )) 

439.48 444.58 B: but i think i think i think they're awesome tools and i you know i think 

444.81 450.94 B: ah too many kids look at them as a internet machine and as 

451.31 452.62 B: a game machine 

453.17 460.07 B: and i think you know there's a lot of other things that you can do with them that you should see earlier 

460.15 461.00 B: (( you know )) 

460.93 467.98 A: maybe you want to give an example for the geom- ah geometry for geometry's also good but geography that you raised before 

464.86 465.60 B: which 

468.03 470.59 B: well if i mean you 

470.93 473.93 B: (( [mn] for geography you know say )) 

474.13 477.06 A: i don't know you can switch to geometry if you feel like it 

475.91 486.32 B: well whatever well we used geography's easy i guess um you would go to something like oh chapter one you're you're studying south east asia so year one computer class 

486.40 491.03 B: has a whole interactive it'd it'd be almost the equivalent to 

491.59 494.01 B: a like a film 

494.44 495.40 A: right 

495.18 503.72 B: and or like a slide show with some questions or you know questions answers that [mn] like a quiz type thing at the end you know but it 

502.80 516.03 A: right because otherwise if you don't have anything that ah that the kids should exactly no but if you don't have anything ah that the kids should should ah bring to this like any input from th- from the from the student then 

505.55 507.49 B: to motivate them to yeah 

516.19 521.96 A: you can do a slide show in the class you can show a film in the class right so there has to be some added 

518.10 519.11 B: yeah 

521.72 536.01 B: well i think i think the added interactive is well the kid can move along at his own pace and there i think there's a lot more i think you're a lot more into it if you are controlling the slide show and what's going on 

522.07 523.58 A: interactive 

536.65 547.27 B: you you know like it's it's the same slide show or you know movie for everybody but if you want to move back or forward i think you're going to pay you know when they show a film in a class of thirty kids 

540.56 541.66 A: yeah 

547.04 549.29 A: yes five of them sleep 

549.03 557.18 B: five of them sleep you know that kind of thing and you know just kind of whatever for the for the quiz but i think peop- kids are a lot more 

557.75 562.95 B: into it when it's right there in front of them it's their it's at their control 

559.07 561.46 A: [laughter] when they actually get to push the buttons 

563.40 575.61 B: 'cause you give them you you it's almost like you're empowering them and you know whether they think of it like that or not but you're empowering them to learn themselves and it would just i think it's just much more interesting for kids 

575.74 590.34 A: right i mean there's a lot of visual stuff involved especially in geography this is what i was thinking you would say because in i mean there there has been all these studies ah around the world and it turns out that the american kids don't know where afghanistan is 

581.49 582.68 B: yeah 

590.14 599.89 A: don't know where i don't know whatever china is or you know forty two percent of american kids don't know where afghanistan is or you know at the age of tw- eighteen 

591.51 593.88 B: anything is yeah
