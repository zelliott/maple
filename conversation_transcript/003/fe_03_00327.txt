59.94 63.87 B: i think if i got up on the stand and i went under oath and i had judges and lawyers looking at me i might be 

64.41 66.18 B: i might have to think that over again but 

67.18 68.26 A: i have a 

67.58 68.05 B: certainly 

68.18 68.46 B: (( )) 

68.95 70.65 B: sit here in my apartment and say yeah i'd lie 

71.41 74.64 A: yeah i'd probably because also my my involvement in it all 

75.66 77.62 A: oh wait did you say you were at penn you're still at penn 

78.27 79.93 B: am i at penn no i'm in uh portland 

80.55 81.29 A: oh you're in portland 

81.39 81.71 A: okay 

81.67 82.06 B: oregon 

83.25 84.27 A: got it got you (( )) 

85.05 94.90 A: i'm with you i'm with you i think it definitely if if a if a lawyer if a judge were there and he was telling me uh that i was going to go in jail i mean i'd take that pretty seriously like like if i wer- were under oath i i would 

95.74 98.58 A: it would change definitely how i'd view it and what i would say 

99.06 99.40 B: yeah 

100.16 101.86 B: although lying under oath doesn't seem to be such 

101.99 105.40 B: the same crime (( )) magnitude of a crime that was probably ten years ago 

106.48 109.79 B: because we see our our po- politicians doing it on a on a regular basis 

110.92 114.46 B: i mean what what how many of our presidents in the last ten years have not lied under oath 

116.37 119.97 A: i don't think bush probably bush doesn't realize he lies under oath 

116.51 117.08 B: probably doesn't 

120.47 122.11 B: he does yeah he's probably not aware of it 

121.84 125.23 A: he's not even smart enough to even catch on 

123.51 124.05 B: (( )) 

125.44 127.71 B: we'll wait until his past catches up with him which it will do 

127.80 129.87 B: which it will soon enough anyways so 

130.58 131.58 A: let's hope let's hope 

131.70 138.33 A: um i think you're right i feel like clinton definitely pioneered that territory very well for even the whole public to see 

139.17 139.57 B: uh-huh 

140.02 140.82 A: on display 

140.69 143.23 B: he made lying acceptable almost fashionable actually 

144.21 145.26 A: yeah i think you i 

146.37 149.17 A: sadly enough i i think you're right (( )) listening to the people 

150.12 154.54 A: it's it's to- it's almost considered the slippery slope when someone's like 

154.69 155.99 A: almost too honest 

156.83 157.10 B: yeah 

157.66 159.78 B: cause i think so many people empathized with him 

160.83 164.41 B: because i think mainly because what he did had nothing to do with running the government 

165.64 169.14 B: but people believed uh reagan when he uh lied under oath as well too so 

170.50 174.85 A: well also the new jersey guy the new jersey politician i don't know if you follow east coast politics 

175.15 176.70 B: uh why what's going on 

177.01 183.76 A: well he was just horrible (( )) and he was really slimy and really took tons of brides and 

184.19 191.94 A: up until the last up until like the two weeks before the campaign he was going to run and but when they finally realized that he was going to lose they took him out but 

191.38 191.88 B: oh he bail- 

192.12 194.53 B: bailed at the last minute but yeah i did read something about that 

195.61 200.25 B: we had a lot of political stuff going on here so that the national kind of got drowned out a little bit 

200.63 201.45 A: i'm sure yeah 

201.60 202.62 A: east coast west coast 

203.03 203.36 B: theater 

203.48 205.85 B: governor's race that was pretty hotly contested 

206.88 208.05 A: who won that ultimately 

208.42 211.13 B: uh coolan goski was his name 

211.77 213.22 B: the uh the democrat won 

213.56 215.38 B: it's very similar i don't know if you've ever been to texas 

215.49 216.99 B: very similar to texas here 

217.11 220.62 B: or portland itself is really liberal but the rest of the state is kind of backwards ass 

221.82 223.80 B: lot of uh lot a kaczynski type people 

224.03 224.70 B: (( )) 

224.35 227.94 A: that's so funny cause i always pictured all as very liberal with eugene and 

227.96 229.40 B: yeah eugene and eugene and portland 

229.59 230.47 B: and maybe salem 

231.19 232.14 B: but it's like that but 

232.47 234.82 B: there's a lot of people in these suburbs and outlying areas 

235.22 235.79 B: there's a lot of uh 

236.57 238.01 B: lot of strange people out here 

238.41 240.33 B: i've only been out here two and a half years so 

240.85 246.92 A: well you know i'm from pennsylvania and i feel that every state has those the cities are just really exceptional i mean even new york 

247.49 253.47 A: you would think that you know new york state would be liberal but it's really not and hillary clinton had a hard time even winning it because 

252.95 253.56 B: yeah yeah 

254.28 254.85 A: yeah 

255.88 257.05 B: and our governor who is a 

257.30 258.35 B: democrat um 

259.35 262.73 B: he lost i think the popular vote he just won in the right he won in the most populous 

263.06 263.97 B: uh areas 

265.03 266.41 B: he won in the you know and that's where the 

267.01 269.81 B: democrats generally are in the populist the populous area 

269.93 270.66 B: popul- 

270.32 270.70 A: right 

271.10 271.68 B: populated 

271.13 271.88 A: populous yeah 

272.18 272.51 B: excuse me 

273.64 277.26 A: poor al gore he's definitely feeling that one 

275.99 276.45 B: yeah 

277.72 282.61 B: yeah that's why he probably decided not to run again although he was funny as hell on saturday night live i don't know if you saw that 

282.25 284.98 A: did you see that no i missed it how was it 

285.03 286.79 B: he was uh he was fun i 

286.94 289.59 B: that show always dies after a half hour anyway but 

289.75 291.01 B: he was funny he did uh 

291.86 292.53 B: he did um 

293.32 297.52 B: him thinking about his how he was going to choose his running mate and they turned it into a bachelor 

297.74 298.29 B: satire 

300.32 302.90 B: so he was in a hot tub with uh with one of i forgot who 

303.19 306.30 B: he was in a hot tub with somebody and they were uh i think lieberman at the end and they were 

306.52 307.62 B: just sipping champagne and 

307.84 309.36 B: pouring champagne into each others mouth 

309.46 310.33 B: pretty funny actually 

309.90 314.60 A: i was going to say i was a little shocked he was even that he did it 

315.26 318.29 B: i was too i had a feeling while i was watching it 

318.48 318.95 B: that he was 

319.11 322.75 B: not going to run because i don't think he would have been doing that stuff had he decided to run 

322.85 325.31 B: so i think i had assumed he made his decision already 

325.46 327.19 B: cause he went on and he 

327.51 330.27 B: (( )) impersonated trent locke too and said some pretty uh 

331.01 331.56 B: somewhat uh 

332.22 333.22 B: controversial things 

333.63 335.39 B: in the in the guise of trent locke though 

335.48 337.44 B: which i thought was pretty funny too cause that guy (( )) 

337.13 343.49 A: i feel like it's a shame he (( )) election or he would've won if he had just taken a backbone and just been more aggressive 

343.34 346.25 B: cause he (( )) came out to be so personable after the election 

346.54 346.92 B: started 

347.09 351.20 B: or i mean after the after he lost the election he kind of came out and was really funny and really personable 

351.61 354.03 B: um i think had he done that earlier own i think more people would have 

354.70 355.09 B: um 

354.87 356.94 A: would've definitely supported him absolutely 

356.22 357.02 B: (( )) 

357.24 357.81 B: probably (( )) 

357.99 360.15 B: portland look who we have now what a complete idiot 

361.33 361.69 B: but 

362.77 363.15 B: can you do 

363.86 364.50 B: can only hope he 

364.18 366.98 A: yeah (( )) talk about perjury 

367.94 370.91 A: this is a much better conversation 

370.23 370.98 B: we just had a (( )) 

371.14 373.65 B: we just had a i had a movie played at the little art house here about 

373.75 374.06 B: uh 

374.86 376.15 B: his coke conviction 

376.50 377.31 B: and how his fa- 

376.73 378.19 A: oh really 

377.87 379.80 B: father basically got it thrown out for him 

380.23 381.70 B: and the guy who wrote a book about it 

382.69 385.35 B: um basically was black balled and lost his job and (( )) 

385.49 387.51 B: run out of the industry run out of the 

387.67 390.48 B: he's a journalist and basically wasn't allowed to work anymore 

391.15 391.86 A: really 

391.77 394.74 B: (( )) yeah now he's like homeless or something some crazy like that 

395.20 400.59 A: you know i have to tell you i really think the the press is is just so easy on him like 

401.42 401.93 A: they don't 

408.86 419.71 A: but all along they've just been they've just given him such generosity that generosity of spirit like letting him get away with things that no one else would've gotten away with and any democrat def- democrats just don't get away with i feel like 

419.97 422.05 B: no and i think i think it's just because 

422.85 428.05 B: for a while there if you disagreed with any of his policies it was considered anti-american i think that's quelled a little bit now 

428.76 429.19 B: um 

429.30 430.05 B: and i hope it quell- 

429.56 436.43 A: well no i mean ari fleischer what did he do he put peo- he puts people in the back if they disagree with him in the press room 

437.04 440.45 B: yeah he's a cock he's a (( )) he's a he's kind of an asshole too 

440.77 441.10 B: (( )) 

442.05 445.92 B: i heard him on his press conference today and talking about gore not running and he's like well we'll just have to 

446.19 450.32 B: the democrats will just put somebody else in that'll raise taxes on the american people that was all he said 

452.50 453.95 A: makes me laugh 

455.13 455.78 B: anyway 

456.58 459.52 B: so yes i would lie under oath if it absolute- i don't know if i would or not 

462.52 463.20 B: yeah i would 

473.44 474.63 A: at face value 

474.97 475.70 A: understanding that 

475.05 475.36 B: yeah 

475.81 476.26 A: yeah 

476.83 478.47 B: i'm not a very good liar anyway so 

478.53 480.84 A: i'm a horrible liar i don't think i could do it for that reason 

481.11 482.96 B: yeah i have a lot of tells so i think people 

483.12 484.52 B: i can't lie to people cause i think i'm 

485.81 486.85 B: people can tell when i'm lying 

488.08 489.13 A: i get a smile on my face 

489.63 490.12 B: you what

500.35 502.99 B: i always do something (( )) give it away i'm sure 

503.93 506.50 A: wait so we ha- we hit our ten minute max 

504.29 504.64 B: but 

504.83 505.25 B: i
