0.51 2.69 B: hi i'm jeff 

1.97 3.46 A: hi i'm tony 

3.46 11.05 B: tony hi ah so ah do you think that any other countries are a threat to the united states 

10.94 15.97 A: [noise] yeah well i've [mn] been pretty concerned about the north korean situation what do you think about that [noise] 

15.69 22.00 B: yeah so that's ah that's kind of caught me off guard i think i wasn't ah paying very close attention to that i had my 

21.88 34.92 B: sights on the middle east and watching what was happening there but ah this north korea's caught me off guard and and ah their leader seems crazy enough to ah to do something whereas ah 

35.00 44.50 B: i i'm i think saddam hussein is crazy but i'm not sure that he's ah i think he's maybe a little more predictable in his craziness if you know what i mean 

44.17 55.12 A: [noise] [noise] yeah i think i would agree with you i think w- not that sa- saddam isn't you know crazy but i think he sort of realizes at some point that you know the oil is their lifeblood there in their economy 

55.24 59.84 A: i look at the north korean situation and say those folks really don't seem to have anything to lose 

59.48 61.03 B: right right 

60.01 64.86 A: and i wonder if that provides for like a more you know irrational kind of motivation [laughter] 

64.26 77.92 B: right yeah so i from well for me personally ah part of the nervousness is that i don't know very much about it you know i i you know as as a citizen i have ah twelve years of experience watching saddam hussein and i 

77.90 85.53 B: ah it's sort of the devil you know and the devil you don't know the the north korea i just you know hasn't been on my radar so i don't know what to expect 

85.05 89.84 A: [noise] i think you're right it's been like that with everybody i think it's sort of snuck up and the situation's become a little bit more volatile 

89.54 91.20 B: yeah 

90.22 90.99 A: (( ah )) 

91.64 105.05 B: yeah well so in what in what way could ah do you in what way do you think north korea could really jeopardize the u._s. ah do they they probably don't have any kind of long range missiles to ah to endanger u._s. soil do you think 

104.35 109.66 A: [cough] i don't know probably not deliberately but i sort of wonder from the terrorist perspective if they've seen enough um 

111.22 119.08 A: ah [mn] of of those happening i guess in the news they ah they appear to have stopped the u._n. inspections [noise] we know that they have ah 

114.26 115.17 B: right 

119.19 123.30 A: [noise] you know that they're you know [mn] very close they've already demonstrated nuclear capability [noise] 

123.07 124.52 B: right right 

123.65 125.32 A: and they now seem to want people ah 

125.15 138.93 A: i i think i remember something or hearing something in the news [noise] about the at least one of the reactors that they had there um well you know nuclear powered reactors i i think the question about it was they were not sure it was producing enough power to be used outside the reactor 

138.76 152.30 A: or i- it was merely self sufficient like just produce enough power to support itself you know that it used but they they seemed to to have demonstrated the capability and they don't seem to want to have folks coming in there and and they're kind of pulling back from international relations 

152.40 159.20 A: [sigh] so i it it it's just an uneasy feeling about ah you know what are they it may be just a ploy for attention 

159.17 160.10 B: right 

159.19 169.82 A: but what are they going to try next [noise] [noise] and unfortunately sometimes these the you know the radical kind of approach does certainly seem to get people's attention [laughter] i certainly don't agree it's the right way to go but it it you know people seem to you know 

160.89 162.27 B: right right 

170.16 178.38 A: when you look at bin laden and the stuff in the middle east i guess that we've all been concentrating on that ah those folks do seem to get their names in the papers and get the attention so 

174.36 175.36 B: right 

178.48 181.41 A: hopefully the the the folks in north korea aren't feeling the same way [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

178.64 179.60 B: right 

180.90 185.84 B: i i wonder if ah north korea is in a position to 

186.11 194.49 B: well so i'm not sure that that north korea has the infrastructure the you know sort of terrorist cell network ah around the world to 

194.56 202.83 B: get something into the u._s. ah in the same way that ah i have the impression that bin laden and al qaeda maybe has been 

195.43 196.30 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

202.83 217.66 B: ah working for years at setting up something ah where they might be able to ah you know trigger some sleeper cell somewhere and ah that took years of planning and fore- if if something exists and i'm not sure if north korea has something 

218.93 230.38 B: ah something reasonable that that it really could do some kind of terrorist ah acts on the u._s. i guess i have thought more that the threat might come from them attacking u._s. interests 

230.30 236.47 B: ah in in the region like ah u._s. troops in south korea or something like that 

235.71 239.45 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] and that's 'bout doing what good point it's probably a more ah )) 

239.50 241.41 A: ah certainly a bigger threat 

241.47 252.50 A: ah i i just find my i i guess i'm uneasy about the whole like yo- you mentioned before that part you just don't know we we've heard so much about that bin laden's been doing and i think you're absolutely correct he's whatever he's been doing he's been working on for years 

246.56 247.44 B: right 

251.99 253.04 B: right 

252.47 262.32 A: he's even made you know threats wh- which seemed idle at the time but these guys you haven't heard much about them before so yo- kind of really don't know where they're at and what they're up to and or what they want [noise] 

261.91 262.97 B: yeah 

262.38 272.39 A: i mean there appear to be a couple of ah you know ah possibly ah nego- negotiating tactics for you know us to take and you know find out what they want i i think we were going to offer them some 

272.43 274.66 A: [sigh] ah power subsidizing 

274.32 275.33 B: yeah 

274.75 282.58 A: ah energy subsidy or something like that just so we could find out what they're doing and get them to stop you know playing games with their nuclear weapons but i just find the kind of ah 

276.63 277.37 B: yeah 

280.42 281.31 B: right 

282.79 287.73 A: ah you know it's it's a little nerve racking i think just just 'cause you don't really know [laughter] 

284.81 287.02 B: yeah it is definitely unnerving 

287.34 298.03 B: yeah my wife is completely convinced ah not of my wife isn't worried about north korea my wife is completely convinced that ah that ah bin laden is ah is gonna ah 

297.95 306.56 B: give us some big attack that we're not expecting in the next few months and so she's ah she get nervous about going downtown ah to whatever 

306.81 309.05 B: ah were where do you live actually 

308.37 313.79 A: (( [noise] i'm i'm actually just out just west of philadelphia so ah i don't know in the western philadelphia suburbs )) 

311.41 313.21 B: (( oh okay um )) 

313.43 316.75 B: yeah okay i'm up north of boston a little bit so 

316.52 318.07 A: oh okay so it's ah 

317.08 320.71 B: so my wife gets nervous about going into boston for anything 

320.62 325.24 A: [noise] oh i can sort of understand that i get the same thing i i my wife patty was saying something about ah 

326.02 331.36 A: [mn] sort of back at thanksgiving like how the i guess the friday right around thanksgiving's considered one of the largest shopping days 

329.25 330.22 B: yeah 

330.96 331.96 B: right 

331.38 335.02 A: and the last place she wanted to be was a mall 'cause she figured it was a perfect target 

333.05 333.97 B: right 

335.27 345.49 A: and so we're saying the same thing just stay away from the malls on the big days [mn] it it's a shame you have to think that way you know [mn] it's entered into our families minds about that but it's a real concern 

335.40 336.20 B: yeah 

343.56 344.51 B: right 

345.38 346.19 B: (( so [mn] )) 

346.36 354.77 B: so i i find there's a difference between my wife and myself on this my wife it actually affects her decisions about you know where she wants to go and so forth she feels like 

354.63 363.19 B: retreating a little bit into the safety of our home and so forth but i i i you know i watch it in the news and i follow it but i don't tend to ah 

363.43 366.01 B: i don't think that it affects my 

366.11 380.66 B: decisions in terms of you know whether i'm likely to travel or or even fly overseas or whatever ah so i think there's different different people have a lot different reactions to how it affects them ah i don't know where do you fall on that does it 

380.32 394.05 A: it now it's funny that you mention that i i haven't had the opportunity to travel since it's happened ah i i used to make at least a trip once or twice a year we we were talking about perhaps like a disney world vacation at some point in time when the kids were out of school but ah 

387.54 388.35 B: yeah 

391.28 392.38 B: right 

394.18 401.31 A: ah and it was my wife that was mostly ah you know interested in doing that and she seems to have not mentioned it in a while so she she's definitely pulled back 

401.01 402.09 B: yeah 

401.53 409.72 A: i i'd like to think ah like you'd mentioned that it wouldn't you know wouldn't affect my day to day decision making that way but i haven't had to actually had cause to test that 

409.59 420.43 A: so i haven't had to travel anywhere i haven't had to get on a plane or you know or anything like that ah i i do tend to think w- with ah the bin laden situation that he's obviously looking for headlines and you know 

420.34 425.68 A: individuals like you know you and i in in our homes was probably in and of themselves are not targets 

425.69 427.94 A: he wants something on a much grander scale 

427.48 428.74 B: (( [noise] right )) 

428.15 437.97 A: so you know it's going to be something like ah you know like a of a big park or people were speculating malls ah you know around the the black friday shopping and the christmas shopping season 

437.60 439.32 B: right 

438.49 449.05 A: so it it's a shame 'cause unfortunately some people will be in the area and and be a victim of circumstances but i think individually ah i don't feel there's as much of a personal threat 

449.37 453.14 A: it doesn't make it any less real of a problem but 

453.19 456.03 B: right right yep i agree 

456.26 457.64 B: i agree 

457.61 471.25 A: ah so it it's kind of funny i i always i was i was speculating to people this is kind of wishful thinking but i guess my my answer to the whole thing and it's something that never would happen is like i kind of felt like the u._s. should put some really strong effort into some alternate forms of fuel 

471.13 473.00 B: [laughter] 

471.50 477.61 A: for cars i me- i mean it just sounds so great it's just something that you know probably will never happen especially with with some of the ah 

473.33 474.11 B: yeah 

477.64 487.02 A: current leaders of our country have coming from oil money it's it's much easier said than done but it just seems to me if you take away the economy over there then those people aren't as much of a threat 

480.01 481.67 B: [laughter] 

482.20 483.15 B: yeah 

486.26 487.39 B: yeah 

486.87 498.10 A: ah you know there's we've got to have other technology that you can power a car with ah you know fly planes with things like that we're starting to investigate i mean there's a couple of hybrid cars on the market i think honda and toyota each have one 

492.78 493.58 B: yeah 

498.35 502.40 A: ah that it's partially battery powered and you know part gas engine 

502.67 508.84 A: so i just kind of thought we just need to develop some technology like that then flood it into the market [laughter] 

506.96 514.19 B: (( that's right that's right yeah that that ah that would so do you have ah do you have a big car do you use a lot of gas )) 

513.05 525.53 A: i i actually sort of have a foreign car i have an old nissan ah maxima which i guess actually was considered a full size car when i bought it it's like a ninety two or a ninety three it it's still pretty old and my wife drives a ah 

523.27 524.24 B: yeah 

525.34 528.46 A: a ford station wagon so they're both big cars 

528.00 529.28 B: yeah yeah 

528.63 533.41 A: which you know from that perspective you've got to be concerned about how much gas you're consuming and where the money is going 

533.05 543.49 B: yeah we just ah well right around the right around the time of the world trade center attacks we upgraded well just before that we upgraded to an s._u._v. and now i'm ah 

543.41 548.66 B: wondering how wise that was and w- wondering how guilty i should feel about that but ah 

547.92 550.03 A: what from the gas consumption or ah 

549.33 552.43 B: just for the gas yeah and and ah how much ah 

552.76 556.73 B: ah you know what what what my contribution is to ah 

556.94 567.83 B: ah making the u._s. dependant on foreign oil or whatever so here in boston there's ah there's sort of urban activists that are going around ah spray painting s._u._v.s ah 

567.60 572.84 B: you know indicating that or slapping bumper stickers on saying this car supports ah 

573.15 577.13 B: ah saddam hussein or osama bin laden or whatever 

576.93 587.64 A: you know some folks get ah pretty radical if they had it themselves i remember seeing ah ah i guess an email that had gone through our company ah probably a month or two ago th- th- it listed a bunch of ah oil companies 

579.25 580.51 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

587.65 593.56 A: and it said ah you know of all these oil companies there's like on- only like two and two of the probably the less known 

593.77 599.89 A: that don't do any importing of oil from ah overseas and ah british petroleum or something like that and it's like ah
