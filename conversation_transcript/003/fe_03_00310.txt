0.11 1.30 B: hello 

0.83 2.17 A: hello 

1.73 3.50 B: hi ah 

2.68 4.31 A: hi i- i'm larry 

3.90 4.95 B: i'm lynica i'm 

5.13 6.32 A: (( how do you do )) 

6.05 7.52 B: (( all right how are you )) 

7.19 11.47 A: okay um not really too sure on how to start all this 

11.04 13.10 B: oh yeah well there you go 

13.28 15.45 B: wherever [laughter] 

13.31 18.62 A: okay well well i was in the airport um yesterday 

16.26 17.08 B: mhm 

18.29 18.97 B: (( mhm )) 

18.93 21.20 A: and it was 

21.66 25.11 A: well a lot of guys just standing around doing nothing 

24.50 26.50 B: yeah what do you mean security guys 

26.56 33.94 A: right there were so few people flying that you know most of them were just standing around doing nothing 

27.19 28.28 B: yeah 

29.89 30.71 B: (( oh )) 

33.32 34.29 B: uh-huh 

34.35 35.48 A: so 

34.39 37.49 B: oh and this is like the extra personnel or whatever that they've hired 

36.88 38.37 A: mhm 

37.74 42.37 B: yeah i haven't been on an airplane for a few months but i've noticed it's been 

42.45 48.95 B: you know it's crazy 'cause we'll go through one time and get every single thing on us searched and then 

49.43 50.41 B: (( you know i don't know )) 

51.64 55.22 A: well i think what's interesting is that um 

55.87 66.10 A: they announce that you'll you'll have some of some of the crowd be pulled off to be you know and it's profiling and i'm curious as to what their profile is 

59.93 60.91 B: mhm 

63.86 64.58 B: (( mm )) 

65.79 80.79 B: right yeah i am too supposedly it's supposed to be random but now i know the last time that we flew i think it really was because everybody who had a certain thing on their ticket like a little black and white thing along the bottom of the boarding pass was they were the ones pulled over 

79.56 80.37 A: (( mm )) 

81.19 84.88 B: and including us but i don't think that's always true at all 

85.16 88.00 A: you know i didn't notice that ah 

86.60 89.80 B: yeah well this is south west i don't think it's true of all the airlines 

90.61 91.61 A: (( hm )) 

92.25 93.11 B: (( i don't know )) 

92.97 95.08 A: yeah because i'm i'm trying to think about 

95.11 98.88 A: if i've ever noticed that and i haven't 

98.21 107.36 B: mhm well i only noticed because somebody because somebody that we know who works for south west pointed it out to us you know ev- all the boarding passes with checkerboards get 

107.51 112.26 B: pulled over but that's really crazy too because they have checkerboards if they're standby tickets 

112.33 113.75 B: so i mean what 

114.02 115.32 B: what kind of 

116.11 119.83 B: i don't know selection is that everybody who's on a standby should be 

116.26 117.31 A: yeah 

119.68 120.76 A: right 

120.03 121.40 B: should be ah 

122.02 123.62 B: (( searched i don't know )) 

123.72 128.94 A: well one of the things about airport security that i noticed is that um 

130.06 137.09 A: i really didn't feel very secure because of it because mostly they looked like people that would be working at mcdonalds 

131.82 133.77 B: mhm mm mhm 

137.14 139.22 B: oh the security people mhm 

138.57 139.84 A: yeah 

139.24 149.14 B: yeah i mean i've heard a lot of stuff on the radio ah about you know people who have been doing this for fifteen years or something who are getting thrown out of their jobs because 

149.56 155.06 B: i don't remember in one case it was somebody who you know was a legal permanent resident but hadn't 

155.07 164.55 B: taken citizenship and she'd been doing this job for you know fifteen years or whatever but if she didn't get citizenship by within a month or something then she lost her job 

165.11 167.22 B: because they were only going to let citizens be 

167.58 169.33 B: airport security workers 

170.51 171.37 B: um 

170.78 173.12 A: yeah you know um 

173.28 174.67 B: i mean i i 

174.71 178.18 B: to me whether you're an american citizen or not doesn't 

175.80 176.60 A: mhm 

178.33 180.97 B: have anything to do with whether you're dangerous or not 

181.24 184.58 B: you know there could be a timothy mcveigh working the airport you know 

181.68 186.20 A: yeah i think that's somewhat independent yeah because um 

186.87 187.75 A: i mean 

188.45 194.48 A: i mean going to school and being at a university you you run into people from all over the world 

190.64 191.48 B: (( mhm )) 

193.95 194.91 B: oh sure 

194.79 202.67 A: and you know like that's totally independent i think the the thing that really kind of strikes me is that 

202.99 206.81 A: i really want to know what's going into the cargo hold of that plane 

206.38 208.00 B: oh yeah 

207.61 210.85 A: you know and in and then yesterday 

208.61 209.74 B: absolutely 

210.95 214.42 A: [cough] when i was flying home ah this 

212.74 213.78 B: mhm 

214.98 222.82 A: gentleman who i'm not sure exactly what nationality he was but he was 

221.10 221.98 B: mhm 

222.89 226.18 A: of some foreign descent who spoke 

224.81 225.73 B: mhm 

226.46 231.92 A: very broken english and i couldn't really tell what his accent was but he had a walking stick 

227.86 228.70 B: mhm 

231.32 232.42 B: (( mhm )) 

232.54 237.97 A: and you know they supposedly took a look at the wa- walking stick 

237.97 238.91 B: mhm 

238.55 242.77 A: (( but i i kind of looked at that and i said geeze you know )) 

242.73 243.70 B: mhm 

243.11 246.07 A: why is he allowed to bring that onto the plane 

245.68 246.74 B: mhm 

246.47 249.96 A: i i just really bothered the daylights out of me you know 

246.81 249.11 B: (( well i don't know )) 

249.97 259.36 A: and he sat next to me no less i mean oh my god i mean i'm sitting there and all of a sudden he sits next to me and i said well then um i'm just going to keep an eye open huh 

255.12 255.92 B: mhm 

258.71 264.79 B: yeah well i mean whether he's sitting next to you whether he's sitting on the other end of the plane if he's going to crash your plane it's all the same 

264.81 268.98 A: well yeah and i i was kind of thinking about that and saying well 

269.33 282.52 A: you know there's all these rules for all these things and then he's got this like club with a point on the end what in the heck is this doing here so yeah airport security well i think that training 

274.52 275.45 B: right 

276.28 277.27 B: right 

279.49 280.42 B: yeah 

282.11 283.18 B: mhm 

282.59 285.32 A: is in order here ladies and gentlemen 

284.90 290.40 B: yeah well i mean certainly given sometimes we get searched up and down and then sometimes they 

290.59 303.45 B: will let me through with what's really lax i mean even not considering that nine eleven ever happened but just just in general what you would consider to be a normal level of security and you know sometimes they don't even 

303.86 305.02 B: care so 

305.10 308.96 B: i could easily be carrying something on there so somebody else could too i don't know 

309.67 311.19 A: yeah um 

310.13 310.95 B: (( i don't know )) 

311.30 318.40 A: i've no problems with the screening you know like x ray it do whatever you want you know go for it 

316.50 317.64 B: mhm 

318.05 319.07 B: mhm 

319.20 321.49 A: and 

320.61 324.78 B: mhm when it causes massive delays in airports 

325.74 326.75 B: pretty 

325.96 327.45 A: well you know 

327.51 329.10 A: i have seen 

329.75 330.72 A: um 

331.03 336.23 A: let's put it this way i i've seen them put people in embarrassing situations 

335.73 338.16 B: yeah yeah absolutely 

337.94 342.62 A: and i understand that 

342.97 349.29 A: they want this to be out in the open and so on and so forth but when when they start saying okay you know like 

345.90 346.82 B: mhm 

349.80 358.82 A: let's see your belt and like pull off your belt and now roll start start rolling down the hem of the top of your dress and stuff like that and i go wait a minute 

351.40 352.36 B: yeah 

356.84 359.71 B: oh yeah that's too much 

359.09 365.62 A: you know and like i actually saw a girl go through that and i went this is wrong if that was my wife i would be screaming 

364.89 369.48 B: for sure the last time we went to the airport my husband was ended up with his 

369.53 375.67 B: you know his shoes off and his belt off and like everything that he could take off off you know 

376.46 377.90 B: ah just like 

378.86 381.17 B: [mn] pretty soon you're going to have people 

381.87 383.45 B: undressing out here 

383.00 386.23 A: yeah doing the old strip search yeah um 

384.51 385.65 B: mhm 

386.87 393.30 B: i didn't i i have to say that the thing that bothers me the most is when we came back to the states this 

393.56 397.45 B: february i guess it was was having ah 

397.96 403.99 B: i don't know if they're army i don't know how they are but guys with big old nasty machine guns standing around the airport 

405.22 409.36 A: well i mean if you travel abroad i mean that's just normal fare 

409.05 412.69 B: um not not anywhere i've traveled i don't know 

411.83 415.80 A: well you go to the u._k. and it's normal and oh yeah 

414.03 414.97 B: really 

415.24 416.53 B: no i've never been there 

416.69 420.82 B: well i don't know i mean i guess in japan i mean the police don't even carry guns so but 

420.22 425.30 A: right well i've been in japan also and yeah it's um 

423.37 424.28 B: mhm 

426.07 430.33 B: but their security when we left was really tight and but they're very polite about it 

430.07 431.08 A: right 

430.52 435.80 B: very very polite i mean they'll go through your whole bag and then they'll shut it all up neatly for you and say thank you 

435.06 440.72 A: right well they they don't openly have the weaponry 

436.39 437.42 B: (( and you're on your way )) 

440.77 441.68 B: mhm 

441.40 443.35 A: you know i'm sure it's there 

443.85 448.99 B: well the army's got it but the police don't carry don't carry firearms they can't 

448.69 451.08 A: well at the airport i'm sure it's there 

450.71 452.76 B: um yeah probably somewhere 

451.31 460.03 A: but i don't think that it's out to do the sort of brazen look at what we got we dare you to do anything kind of thing 

454.37 455.25 B: mhm 

457.68 459.20 B: no yeah yeah 

459.45 460.34 B: yeah 

460.08 461.01 A: you know 

461.69 467.52 A: so yeah i kind of disagree with that because i don't like a police state and 

466.26 468.31 B: yeah for sure 

469.74 480.61 A: i i understand that there's a there's a need for that and thank god that there's people that do that but i don't think that airport security has to go to that that 

478.30 479.21 B: yeah 

479.94 483.37 B: well i mean because if you find somebody i mean 

483.63 493.37 B: i i'm just not sure what you're going to accomplish with a machine gun if you've got enough security forces there you don't i mean especially in a place with that kind of crowds i mean i just don't think that's right 

493.53 494.37 B: (( you know )) 

494.39 500.04 B: to get in the middle of of the public where there's thousands of people coming in and out mhm 

499.74 507.02 A: well frankly is that i i think that the screening process is all wrong because if you did find somebody what in the heck are you going to do with them 

506.26 508.25 B: exactly exactly 

507.63 514.23 A: i mean here you're standing with the largest almost the largest density of people when there is a rush right there at the screening 

512.36 513.30 B: right 

513.95 519.72 B: right i'd be curious to know do they have a plan for evacuating the airport or whatever you know if they somebody with 

518.83 524.14 A: [laughter] yeah you know ladies and gentlemen find the nearest exit good luck 

520.05 520.84 B: uh-huh 

523.77 525.79 B: right yeah 

524.58 530.40 A: you know but i i i think that if they did find someone who 

531.44 533.64 A: was really a security threat 

533.06 533.65 B: (( mhm )) 

534.09 545.30 A: would it really be intelligent to shake 'em down amongst all the rest of the folks because if this person was of the mindset to be there with 

539.86 540.83 B: (( mhm )) 

543.13 544.05 B: mhm 

545.95 552.76 A: what anyone basically should know they shouldn't be there with you know weaponry or whatever 

549.76 550.92 B: right right 

551.79 554.14 B: (( right yeah how are they going to react )) 

552.88 559.43 A: you know why are you going to jeopardize the security of all those folks around them 

556.19 556.91 B: (( mhm )) 

557.10 558.35 B: absolutely 

558.70 559.91 B: absolutely 

559.59 568.98 A: so there should be like a tiered process where if someone is identified they're allowed to go through but they're picked up at some other place 

562.52 563.52 B: mhm 

565.10 565.92 B: mhm 

567.65 569.68 B: mhm right 

569.00 573.33 A: where it is safe away from the rest of the folks 

571.32 572.55 B: mhm 

572.93 587.49 B: yeah and it seems like having enough personnel and having you know some kind of i don't know having handcuffs having a stun gun or whatever having restraints and whatever you're going to have is one thing but having i just don't like seeing machines in the middle of people it what it makes me think of is when i went to 

587.53 591.56 B: guatemala you know ten years ago and there's people standing on the street corners with 

591.67 597.04 B: machine guns you know and that's not what i want to see in my airport 

592.29 593.44 A: (( yeah )) 

597.29 598.40 A: right 

597.47 600.95 B: i don't know i don't know i think that makes it seem like a i think that 

602.37 604.57 B: (( i don't know it's a scarier )) 

602.94 603.86 A: well 

604.56 607.66 A: one would hope that we're more civilized than that 

605.87 608.41 B: (( situation to be in mhm )) 

607.77 609.04 A: (( but if )) 

608.46 609.32 B: (( i don't know )) 

609.16 614.80 A: we really are as technologically advanced as we tout to be 

614.33 615.32 B: (( mhm )) 

615.02 618.09 A: why can't we figure out a better way of doing this 

617.72 626.95 B: mhm oh well ow i mean that's that's the thing if it's not about technology and that's the whole point of why 

618.74 619.55 A: ah 

628.32 629.18 B: (( you know )) 

629.19 638.15 B: the hijackers are able to carry this off because you just figure out a low tech solution and there's going to be lots of those and there's going to there's no way that you can prevent them all 

637.94 639.47 A: well yeah i mean 

639.54 640.29 A: w- 

640.41 648.65 B: like what to do when you see i mean what do you do when you see that somebody has all the technology and that's the obvious that's you know not i'm not saying 

640.58 642.54 A: you're you're right and i agree with you 

648.76 652.69 B: it's intelligent to be a terrorist but if you're going to if you have a plan i mean the 

652.86 656.88 B: your best chance is to go with the opposite route you know if somebody's 

657.28 664.04 B: bristled to the teeth with with technology and with weaponry well you go with the low tech route and it's obvious that's 

664.18 665.54 A: that's what they did 

664.64 666.05 B: (( what they did yeah )) 

665.99 672.04 A: but i i guess what i was trying to get at was that if there was a tiered process 

671.44 672.62 B: mhm 

671.96 682.81 A: the technology should be in place to be able to screen you if you do have traces of um explosives on you or contraband or whatever the case may be 

673.90 674.90 B: (( mhm )) 

677.95 679.12 B: mhm 

679.61 680.51 B: mhm 

682.38 683.12 B: yeah 

683.07 684.96 A: um and i 

685.54 689.81 A: i i think that if you are going into a public arena 

689.14 690.50 B: (( mhm )) 

689.83 693.11 A: you do in some ways 

694.54 697.98 A: are placed in a position of surrendering your personal rights 

697.83 702.21 B: well i don't think you're in a place of surrendering your personal i don't think you should ever 

702.28 706.54 B: have to surrender your rights to be anywhere otherwise you'd be in your house all the time but [mn] 

706.80 707.96 B: to 

709.09 711.74 B: be under certain obligations yeah i mean the 

712.04 719.89 B: not rights but there there there are limits to what you can do in public for sure i mean there are limits there are certainly you can expect to be you know
