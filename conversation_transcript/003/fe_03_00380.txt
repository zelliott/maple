58.03 61.17 A: well the conflicts don't appear to be so much between 

62.04 64.09 A: muslim and muslim at least in 

64.26 66.08 A: reasonable countries but um 

67.03 68.53 A: um between different 

69.19 70.75 A: ethnic groups like 

70.89 72.02 A: israel and um 

72.98 75.88 A: um the palestinians where the problems are 

76.89 81.24 A: uh the attempts on either side to set up a a religious state rather than a 

81.77 82.84 A: secular state 

84.84 85.39 A: anyway 

86.19 86.69 B: i agree 

87.15 87.43 B: um 

88.33 88.71 B: i mean 

89.90 91.68 B: it's not like this is something new 

92.57 93.32 B: been going on 

93.84 94.58 B: forever now an- 

95.08 95.51 A: mhm 

96.90 98.77 B: battles are never won when they um 

101.22 101.66 A: mhm 

103.20 103.55 A: yeah 

104.51 108.39 A: i mean historically on one level the middle east has been far more stable 

109.26 111.48 A: um you know once the initial 

112.11 112.74 A: um 

112.95 114.38 A: attempt to conquer 

115.10 118.12 A: and proselytize the rest of the world faded out 

118.82 120.34 A: in the ninth or tenth century 

120.73 122.09 A: and what does that mean i wonder 

122.76 125.16 A: or that a call for me maybe but anyway 

125.33 125.93 A: um 

126.64 127.92 A: once that initial 

129.04 130.70 A: (( first )) ended um 

131.36 134.95 A: things rea- you know quieted down reasonably and there was that golden age 

135.76 141.37 A: um fo- you know for the arab or muslim world in the seventh eighth ninth and tenth centuries 

141.98 143.39 A: ended of course by the 

143.90 146.93 A: incursions of the mongols and later by the turks 

147.87 150.09 A: uh whom each conquered um 

151.04 152.92 A: in an attempt to build empires 

154.03 157.24 A: but if you look at europe europe's had endless wars 

157.94 158.54 A: um 

158.77 160.55 A: you know with um 

160.84 165.07 A: the various kings the hundred years war the thirty years war then the 

165.36 169.75 A: you know the wars of nationalism in the nineteenth century and then your wars with 

170.54 175.29 A: eh germany and russia and the nazis and the whole bit and um 

175.99 181.83 A: maybe now its getting to the point where there'll be some peace but certainly in the middle east nothing on that scale 

183.47 184.85 A: of of disaster 

185.70 192.69 A: so i'm i have more hope provided that people don't make differences between themselves based on religion only 

193.01 193.41 B: mhm 

195.56 200.01 A: that doesn't mean that people shouldn't be religious or have a spiritual outlook i think 

195.71 195.97 B: (( )) 

200.69 202.27 A: that's the only right way to live 

203.60 204.01 A: anyway 

205.01 207.31 A: i'm doing all the talking 

206.36 211.62 B: sorry um i guess and then the other question was um i guess what should the us be involved 

212.69 213.06 B: um 

215.10 217.86 B: to be honest i'm not sure i mean in in some respects 

215.14 215.55 A: well 

219.86 223.54 A: well only if it can be an even broker or a neutral party 

224.38 229.07 A: um were not that for two reasons number one were busily there 

229.25 232.11 A: um you know because of oil 

232.44 232.83 B: mhm 

232.95 235.71 A: um and were also there because of um 

236.44 239.37 A: a strange predilection to um 

239.62 241.09 A: you know israel 

242.06 242.54 A: i don't 

242.99 244.33 A: you know obviously 

244.56 249.06 A: the birth of israel and all the rest of it based on the horrors of the 

249.39 255.44 A: holocaust made a lot of sense but the subsequent history to the present time doesn't make any sense 

256.31 258.13 A: um from us to be backing it 

259.12 261.44 A: for us to be feeding billions to um 

261.56 263.07 A: israel only for them to be 

263.97 270.13 A: essentially building settlements in in an are that's occupied territory otherwise is a misuse of 

270.68 272.70 A: or dollars and good will in my view 

272.77 273.19 B: (( )) 

274.12 274.47 A: so 

275.06 277.95 B: unfortunately i think that everyone sees us just being there 

280.57 281.50 B: protect our oil 

281.86 282.51 A: yeah 

282.86 284.85 B: and of course that's not shedding very good 

285.35 285.82 A: that's right 

285.59 287.02 B: setting positive light on us 

287.86 290.82 B: so it gives them more reason to not want us there or not want us 

292.01 295.65 A: yeah having said that the arab world is happy to sell the oil 

299.40 300.07 A: although 

300.59 306.75 A: if countries that are ultraconservative like saudi arabia end up being modernized because of it well that's there problem 

307.86 312.92 A: meaning um that if they expose themselves to western secular society 

313.16 315.54 A: and that causes internal tensions well 

316.53 316.89 A: you know 

317.22 321.01 A: one one can be understanding but not necessarily sympathetic 

325.60 327.07 B: i don't know is that it 

327.23 330.63 A: i don't know what are we supposed to do talk for ten minutes an hour or 

330.74 331.24 B: uh 

331.41 333.46 B: to be honest i'm not sure uh 

333.08 333.49 A: uh 

334.72 335.08 A: well 

334.99 336.86 B: i thought it was gonna be kind of like a just a brief 

337.37 339.95 B: discussion but um i'm glad it was more informative 

340.27 342.67 A: we're agreeing to easily that's the problem i suppose 

344.32 345.57 A: all right then 

344.48 346.91 B: definitely not an easy topic to discuss 

347.05 347.61 A: yeah 

349.65 353.01 A: yeah i mean i'm many ways the middle east is five hundred years behind 

353.28 354.70 A: um the west in its 

355.45 358.21 A: liberalization and appreciation of um 

359.43 362.83 A: you know the values of a secular society a free society 

363.64 366.46 A: um much of what they're going through now um 

367.36 373.61 A: europe went through five hundred years ago uh si- four hundred years ago with the religious wars and the reformation and all the rest 

374.25 375.99 A: that hasn't happened yet in the middle east 

376.68 378.07 A: so that causes problems 

378.20 379.10 A: um but 

378.32 378.63 B: yeah 

379.54 383.71 A: if you understand that from a historical point of view than you live with it til its 

384.27 385.11 A: runs its course 

386.79 387.12 A: but 

387.50 389.68 A: anyway well i suppose we can just hang up 

388.31 388.96 B: okay 

390.03 392.21 A: night oh wait a moment what 

390.07 391.55 B: all right well it was nice talking to y- 

393.22 394.74 A: were supposed to go ten minutes 

394.88 398.44 A: oh my assistant here tells me were supposed to go ten minutes have we gone ten minutes 

400.42 400.77 A: oh 

402.09 403.68 A: he doesn't think we've gone ten minutes 

405.09 407.08 B: now i'm trying to read back through here but uh 

410.87 411.28 A: mhm 

411.42 412.76 B: how long just uh 

413.39 413.99 A: mhm 

414.52 415.52 B: topics will provide 

415.83 417.39 B: (( )) conversation 

416.95 417.38 A: yeah 

417.93 423.73 A: well its interesting when you coming back to the subject of the middle east you know um 

423.93 427.91 A: we have in the west in terms of western christianity three branches 

428.81 430.12 A: you have your um 

430.85 432.97 A: catholics on one extreme who 

433.56 434.80 A: follow a pope 

435.45 438.15 A: and a religious hierarchy that descends 

438.39 439.59 A: theoretically from peter 

440.54 443.31 A: um and then you have your protestants 

444.07 445.34 A: who are um 

446.15 447.41 A: you know um 

447.73 454.20 A: anywhere from similar to catholics like your anglicans to your very liberal protestants 

454.90 460.97 A: then you have your extreme left if you want to put it that way un- unitarians who don't even necessarily have a minister 

462.11 465.21 A: and well the arab world is similar in that the muslims have three 

465.55 466.63 A: categories of 

467.35 468.64 A: mainstream muslims 

468.79 473.34 A: on the side corresponding to your catholics are your shia who um 

474.11 476.44 A: you know believe in the descent from the profit 

477.38 480.47 A: um and you know believe in that kind of 

481.18 485.06 A: um religious authority being passed down 

485.39 485.75 B: mhm 

485.94 489.62 A: and there very authoritarian like you catholic hierarchy 

489.99 490.32 B: mhm 

490.71 491.62 A: the you have your 

492.08 500.17 A: alal- you know your group analogous to the protestants who are you sunnis who make up what the population in iraq jordan syria 

500.93 504.12 A: and so on and these people tend to be more liberal more 

504.62 506.61 A: freed from a purely 

507.43 512.57 A: religious orthodoxy um you know you take iran for example which is largely shia 

509.43 509.68 B: right 

513.56 515.11 A: as compared to um 

515.37 517.25 A: syria which is much more secular 

518.21 522.67 A: then your other extreme analogous to unitarians are your (( karaite )) who um 

523.50 526.57 A: um are your b- dominant population in north africa 

526.68 527.77 A: and they elect 

528.64 535.58 A: you know there own leaders in the syn- you know in the mosques and so on 

532.57 532.90 B: mhm 

534.19 534.48 B: mm 

536.49 537.62 B: i didn't realize there were that many 

538.56 538.90 A: yeah 

539.90 543.35 A: yeah the basic three as compared to us and uh 

543.54 545.70 A: you can look at history from that point of view 

547.62 549.88 B: suddenly given me some more stuff to read up on 

549.90 553.37 A: okay well i think we must have done ten minute by now 

553.61 554.01 B: yeah 

554.04 554.62 A: take care 

554.83 555.91 B: thanks it was nice meeting you 

555.36 555.79 A: uh 

556.08 556.62 A: yeah bye bye 

556.75 557.12 B: bye bye
