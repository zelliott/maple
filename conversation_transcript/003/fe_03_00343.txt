59.39 60.48 A: closer and closer 

60.60 60.89 A: to 

61.18 62.49 A: opening my own business 

62.90 63.96 A: mostly forced 

64.05 65.76 A: by being forced out of job 

65.77 66.39 B: uh-huh 

66.18 68.79 A: and being unemployed for a long time 

68.64 69.22 B: uh-huh 

69.29 71.25 A: and so you have to out a way 

71.43 72.11 A: do anything 

72.24 72.89 B: right 

73.28 73.80 B: right 

73.35 77.00 A: so uh would you want to open your own business if money was no object 

77.20 79.08 B: i don't think so um 

79.25 91.07 B: it's funny as much as i complain about what i do and i'm a teacher in a private school so i have plenty of complaints um i really don't like the idea of 

91.36 92.21 B: um 

92.43 95.87 B: having to really fend for myself without knowing that there's that 

96.09 99.39 B: steady paycheck um i find myself 

99.66 105.28 B: lying awake at night just thinking about the things i have to think about letting alone having to worry about 

106.01 109.03 B: all the things that would be involved with running my own business 

109.19 109.54 A: yeah 

109.80 113.79 B: especially if there were investments involved 

113.47 114.13 A: uh-huh 

114.01 116.75 B: you know as opposed to something where i wouldn't have to 

116.99 118.51 B: invest money um 

118.88 123.97 B: you know like i do tutoring of kids and if i thought about that being a business where i didn't have a 

124.33 128.95 B: place that i rent or a place that i own i could do something like that 

128.87 129.13 A: yeah 

129.13 131.41 B: but i don't think i'd want to open myself up 

131.53 132.48 B: to um 

132.83 136.14 B: having to lay out too much money and lose it that's pretty scary 

135.91 139.75 A: uh-huh well yeah well you know you don't really need 

140.13 140.61 A: uh 

141.53 144.48 A: money to do uh set up a business although money 

144.71 145.78 A: might be an object 

145.89 146.97 A: you know but uh 

147.51 149.26 A: i i actually took uh 

149.39 150.41 A: uh some classes 

150.51 151.62 A: uh with uh 

152.33 152.86 A: uh 

152.97 159.41 A: development office here in brooklyn where they actually go through all the steps that you would have to take to 

159.23 159.66 B: right 

159.54 161.20 A: open your own business which is 

160.50 161.01 B: right 

161.65 164.30 A: a very interesting course in itself you know 

163.90 164.51 B: uh-huh 

164.90 165.41 A: uh 

165.90 167.08 A: and and you know w- 

167.46 170.44 A: what bothers me there is that when you open a business and 

170.70 172.04 A: in america it always 

172.78 174.91 A: related to making lots of money 

174.77 175.61 B: that's true 

175.80 177.00 B: that's true 

176.82 178.45 A: and my uh 

179.01 182.59 A: i don't necessarily want to make a lot of money 

181.26 186.51 B: uh-huh do you think in other places though that that's not true where opening a business 

187.02 189.53 B: is done for reasons other than making money 

190.46 193.17 A: well i i don't know i guess uh 

194.85 198.37 A: it's not so even so much to make money but the the the business 

198.77 201.39 A: when i was taking this class it wasn't so much that 

201.77 205.93 A: that you're making money but uh it was that other people had to spend their money 

206.22 208.73 A: you know it was more like sell sell sell 

206.81 207.21 B: right 

208.45 209.80 B: right right right right 

209.18 211.00 A: and and and i feel that 

211.15 213.88 A: people in am- you know in the world now 

215.96 217.36 A: live more simpler life 

217.47 217.89 A: than the 

217.60 218.01 B: right 

218.10 219.05 A: and should have to 

219.21 223.00 A: buy less so my business would be into that direction i would like to 

223.56 226.85 A: to have a business in in in doing research and uh 

228.19 228.48 A: develop 

229.11 229.72 B: uh-huh 

230.65 231.98 A: the life of the people 

232.25 232.75 B: right 

232.76 233.25 A: you know 

233.95 234.46 A: less 

235.13 235.87 A: spending money 

235.94 238.22 B: right right less consumer 

236.00 241.63 A: yeah because our economy is so tied into it you know they want to make the economy get better by 

238.70 239.79 B: right mhm 

242.23 245.36 A: making people buy more but we really don't need more 

245.21 248.16 B: mhm so you have to sell your idea to the government 

248.03 249.68 A: yeah 

250.05 250.93 A: yeah 

251.46 255.16 B: or to some investor who's willing to finance you right 

255.18 255.63 A: right 

256.35 262.15 A: well it's i mean it's funny because you know i live in uh i live in far rockaway where uh where that's an abandoned 

262.25 262.92 A: you know it so it 

263.38 266.50 A: people throw a lot of their stuff out so i'm like you know if they 

265.35 265.83 B: mhm 

266.85 268.89 A: if they would recycle their stuff they wouldn't have 

269.00 270.58 A: to throw it in my backyard 

270.42 271.35 B: that's true 

271.79 278.64 B: that's true well there's a business for you just uh collecting recyclables and doing things with that refurbishing and all that right 

276.68 277.07 A: right 

277.75 278.12 A: yeah 

279.24 283.92 A: well i i like to i like to do the intellectual pursuits and i don't actually like the 

284.57 285.12 A: the 

285.33 290.76 A: it so it's difficult i mean teaching you know you you say you're in a private sch- work in a pri- 

290.66 291.10 B: right 

290.99 293.44 A: school right so you could start your own school 

299.74 300.16 A: right 

305.35 307.00 B: and so i think that 

307.28 308.89 B: in a business i'd have to make 

309.25 312.74 B: too many decisions that i would find hard to make whether it was 

313.12 314.73 B: hiring firing 

315.04 320.49 B: dealing with people who hadn't you know suppliers who hadn't paid things like that i'm not very good at that 

320.20 320.67 A: right 

320.78 327.22 A: but i mean you know especially in the in that in that course it became quite obvious that that's what people think you know 

327.37 339.03 A: oh uh if i start my own business the thing is you can hire people to do the things you don't want to do you know so if you're if you're in the hiring and firing well you have to get together with some people i guess 

332.10 332.91 B: that's true 

333.41 334.17 B: that's true 

340.03 344.73 A: but there there is a lot of things that especially if money is no object 

344.29 349.00 B: absolute- that's true that was part of the deal that money was no object 

344.85 346.01 A: then 

346.40 347.88 A: then we could go places 

348.04 348.83 A: right 

349.09 350.63 A: i like that idea 

350.55 352.34 B: right 

352.67 354.49 A: but it is a it is a um 

354.64 355.98 A: a complicated business 

356.13 358.95 A: then uh then also i mean i do like it because i have 

359.29 360.62 A: i like making my own 

360.88 361.37 A: rule 

361.60 362.22 B: mhm 

362.07 364.75 A: and and and so this is really 

365.28 367.01 A: the part that i do like and 

366.79 367.27 B: right 

367.22 369.93 A: and or about having an own your own business 

370.04 372.62 B: right and setting your own hours that's nice 

371.82 372.14 A: right 

372.81 381.73 A: but it is uh and but it is uh kind of scary but you know uh your own hours it's it's basically you know there's never enough there's only twenty four hours in the day 

381.71 382.45 B: that's right 

382.71 388.15 B: that's right and you also feel that if you're not working things aren't getting done and 

388.34 395.05 B: um it's hard to take a vacation because things depend on you again unless you have really good people who are working for you 

394.18 394.45 A: yeah 

394.88 395.17 A: yeah 

395.48 395.84 A: and that 

395.93 397.77 A: so and those those are all issues so 

397.54 398.25 B: mhm 

398.31 399.36 A: so it's a two edged 

399.48 401.67 A: sword but uh but actually i was uh 

402.55 404.56 A: reading a very interesting book tha- 

404.65 406.17 A: -t that uh says that 

406.69 410.86 A: most people now in the in the market of today uh are going to be 

411.13 412.81 A: either self employed 

412.69 413.16 B: right 

413.27 417.17 A: ah because you know in my business which you know i'm a computer programmer 

417.05 417.57 B: mhm 

417.85 418.88 A: uh you know 

419.10 421.48 A: it's mostly people that do consulting 

421.57 422.06 B: right 

422.14 425.42 A: and you will not be working for a uh a jo- a boss and you know 

422.22 422.67 B: right 

426.10 428.30 A: teachers are a fe- a fe- some of the few that 

428.43 428.97 A: still do 

429.30 430.40 B: right that's true 

430.32 431.29 A: but um 

431.92 432.20 A: so 

433.11 436.05 A: anyway how long are we going to keep this conversation 

436.02 438.97 B: i well my daughter was the one who told me about this 

439.11 439.62 A: mhm 

439.47 449.80 B: um she's friends with somebody who's um part of the program at penn and she said that in ten minutes the come on and tell you thank you very much you can hang up now 

443.57 443.86 A: i 

448.06 448.55 A: okay 

450.00 450.66 A: so cool 

450.75 452.04 B: it really is 

451.16 451.59 A: uh 

452.06 452.39 A: yeah 

452.54 453.08 A: uh 

453.62 455.16 A: and and though you know all this is 

455.27 456.97 A: this is a very interesting uh 

457.35 460.49 A: project except i haven't done my homework because i 

460.63 461.89 A: sort of signed up for it 

462.31 465.57 A: and i never finished it but they called me anyway 

465.20 466.67 B: right well i know that it's 

466.80 469.62 B: to deal with voice recognition um 

469.75 470.44 B: software 

470.96 476.35 A: i see and that's what um one of my very much i am very interested in voice recognition and and 

475.74 476.36 B: mhm 

476.50 477.77 A: and telecommunication 

476.66 480.54 B: well it certainly is that i would think the coming field is in computer programming 

480.97 481.88 A: well it's it's 

482.00 483.65 A: really not the programming that that 

483.74 488.19 A: the problem here the the the the coming field it has to be the hardware 

488.52 489.08 B: mhm 

488.57 490.73 A: i have i've done some studies in uh 

491.21 492.44 A: in this and uh 

493.71 495.91 A: and it would be a very interesting 

496.02 497.00 A: thing to do but 

497.54 498.73 A: really the hardware is 

498.98 499.52 A: stopping us 

499.95 500.44 B: hm 

500.33 501.38 A: so i'm uh 

501.75 503.31 A: i'm a member of a a s- a 

503.42 503.91 A: think group 

504.35 504.92 A: does voice 

505.50 506.75 A: uh recognition 

506.59 507.14 B: mhm 

506.88 507.21 A: and 

507.68 510.06 A: and the voice recognition is a very uh 

511.27 512.86 A: interesting topic but 

514.52 515.35 A: with all the 

516.84 521.15 A: type of people and the speech impediments that we all suffer with 

518.80 520.17 B: right exactly 

524.89 525.57 A: right 

527.49 533.25 B: um different um dialects and ways of pronouncing things and um 

533.48 537.78 B: uh even things like idiomatic expressions i think would just come into play an awful lot 

537.55 537.80 A: yeah 

538.78 545.10 A: so and that that's the kind of uh business that i would i would like to have a some kind of a company that that 

545.71 546.93 A: purely does resear- 

547.06 547.60 B: mhm 

547.64 550.41 A: uh and and you know i like academics um 

551.21 552.17 A: uh a lot 

552.36 552.86 B: mhm 

552.42 552.80 A: uh 

552.94 554.37 A: where where you really can just 

555.30 558.87 A: you know spend money and not uh necessarily have to make money 

559.25 560.06 B: that's true 

560.20 564.86 A: because this is a field where you have to really you know it's you have to get your i- 

560.22 561.05 B: but that's true 

565.71 566.08 A: your
