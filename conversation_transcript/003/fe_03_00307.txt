31.09 31.65 B: a whole lot 

31.10 32.43 A: yeah 

31.96 33.58 B: to say about this topic right 

33.28 35.21 A: yeah but i've heard that um 

35.69 36.83 A: it's really tough getting out 

37.09 38.56 A: of the um the airport 

39.20 40.46 A: of getting in and out of the airport 

40.71 41.77 A: it takes a long time 

42.76 44.19 B: yeah yeah um 

44.62 46.44 B: i mean i fly a couple times a year maybe 

46.57 47.52 B: three or four maybe 

48.28 48.91 B: and 

49.99 50.46 B: um 

51.02 51.38 B: it's 

51.56 53.73 B: it's true you definitely don't want to cut it 

54.08 54.37 B: close 

55.44 58.90 B: but ah i don't know i think there are things you can do to make it speed up a little bit 

59.65 60.17 A: mhm but 

59.79 60.45 B: like ah 

60.52 61.27 A: like what 

61.21 61.76 B: take your 

62.67 67.88 B: i don't know someone told me to take your belt off before you go through the security sensors because they're more sensitive now 

65.96 68.13 A: yeah mhm 

68.30 69.35 A: my friend um 

69.42 71.64 B: i'm not sure if that's true that i do it anyway 

69.45 69.99 A: just came 

71.51 76.78 A: yeah my friend from just came from atlanta and um he was forced to take his belt and his shoes off 

76.92 77.47 B: oh okay 

77.33 77.84 A: and it was 

78.17 79.47 A: it was crazy he was mad 

79.52 81.52 B: had he already gone through the thing and set it off 

81.57 81.98 A: yeah 

82.50 86.19 B: see yeah th- that's the thing once you set it off then you're you're just 

87.09 87.47 B: screwed 

87.56 88.36 A: right 

87.98 92.94 B: i mean you need you need to make sure and take it off beforehand cause then you can just breeze through right 

90.19 91.09 A: yeah 

93.17 93.72 A: right 

94.24 96.26 A: so i guess you have to make plans to 

96.45 99.86 A: leave an hou- two hours early or something like that before you get on the plane 

100.74 104.41 B: yeah i mean well my wife and i will get to the airport like a 

105.34 109.07 B: maybe an (( )) an hour and half early or something that's usually okay 

109.23 109.76 A: right 

109.80 110.23 B: um 

110.96 114.35 B: she's international so going through immigration can take a while 

114.38 115.30 A: oh okay 

114.95 115.56 B: also 

115.69 116.81 A: right 

116.27 118.57 B: so we usually worry more about that than the security 

118.24 119.45 A: yeah where is she from 

119.91 122.07 B: trinidad its an island in the caribbean 

121.59 123.86 A: yeah m-hm my boyfriend's from trinidad what is 

123.95 124.88 B: oh how funny is that 

124.11 125.10 A: what a coincidence 

125.25 125.62 A: uh 

125.29 128.26 B: oh that's cool they probably know each other it's such a small place you know 

126.31 126.72 A: yeah 

128.05 128.56 A: mhm 

128.58 129.22 B: have you ever been 

129.40 131.61 A: no mm mm they ah ah

132.82 134.08 A: trinidad in november 

134.15 134.53 B: uh-huh 

135.66 136.14 B: well then 

136.52 137.55 B: security down there is 

138.02 138.75 B: not too bad 

139.35 141.43 B: and the airport is definitely not as good as here 

141.47 142.00 A: right 

143.07 143.52 B: um 

144.62 145.65 B: so yeah well you should 

146.12 146.55 B: you should 

146.83 147.91 B: fly down there and check it out 

148.35 152.22 A: yeah i'm i'm very excited i've seen so many pictures ah of carnival 

153.56 157.10 B: yeah i've never been to carnival i've been twice um at other times and 

153.76 154.64 A: every thing's so (( )) 

157.57 159.44 B: and ah it's just great it's a really nice place 

159.79 160.48 A: yeah 

160.07 161.20 B: and you'd be staying with 

161.32 161.65 B: like 

162.08 163.74 B: people he knows there or his family right 

162.11 162.93 A: family 

164.34 164.74 A: right 

165.10 165.52 A: um 

165.96 166.45 A: i'm 

166.72 168.31 A: i'm not an outdoorsy person 

168.40 168.83 B: oh really 

168.45 169.02 A: and 

169.40 172.94 A: yeah their grandmother is the only person in their family who still lives there and 

173.25 175.38 A: she lives in a very deserted area 

175.50 176.18 B: oh okay 

175.60 176.04 A: um 

176.13 177.58 A: no running water or electricity 

178.13 179.02 A: and stuff so 

178.27 178.76 B: oh wow 

179.37 180.51 B: probably in the south right 

181.27 183.42 A: um i guess i'm i'm not sure 

182.35 182.91 B: oh okay 

183.77 185.12 A: but yeah 

185.59 187.33 A: i'm not too excited about that but 

187.82 188.62 A: i would like to go 

188.81 189.44 B: sure sure 

188.84 189.68 A: i would like to go 

191.64 192.19 B: well um 

193.29 195.65 B: i guess we should talk more about the security thing too right 

195.13 195.76 A: yeah 

196.13 199.07 B: it's something i've noticed which is kind of funny if you get pulled over 

199.38 202.90 B: once you get through the main security when you're actually getting onto the plane 

202.96 203.36 A: uh-huh 

203.69 205.64 B: um and they do those random checks 

206.27 208.46 B: based on whatever code is on your boarding pass 

206.38 207.58 A: oh do they do that 

208.72 209.26 A: okay 

209.23 209.64 B: um 

209.87 210.63 B: something like that 

211.31 214.65 B: i mean that doesn't always have to be too bad because if you get picked early 

215.46 219.14 B: then as soon as they're done looking at your stuff which doesn't take too long then they let you board 

219.41 220.47 B: and it might be before 

219.53 220.00 A: mhm 

220.93 223.21 B: ah you would have been able to board otherwise because 

223.44 224.44 B: you know say you were 

224.68 225.22 B: sitting in the 

225.87 228.24 B: front of the plane they wouldn't let you on 'til last right 

228.56 229.06 A: right 

228.97 232.15 B: if you got called for security check right at the beginning of things then 

230.36 231.22 A: right 

231.89 232.66 A: right 

232.43 234.82 B: (( boop )) you're right on with the first class people practically 

233.45 234.08 A: right 

235.03 235.56 A: yeah 

235.83 236.77 A: well that's interesting 

236.72 239.01 B: that happened to us a couple times i think actually the 

239.62 240.14 B: girl 

240.56 241.13 B: liked 

241.42 242.33 B: my brother in law 

242.86 246.37 B: because she kind of looked at us and then she called us over there in this like flirty way 

246.47 247.82 A: mm 

246.79 250.72 B: and then she kind of pretended to look through our stuff and just talked for a second then we just looked through 

250.98 251.97 A: um mm 

251.56 252.20 B: i don't know 

252.45 253.41 A: well you all were lucky 

253.66 254.80 B: well yeah i guess so 

255.33 255.82 A: yeah 

255.45 255.71 B: oh 

255.81 257.34 B: it's a good thing we weren't terrorists i guess 

257.58 258.26 A: oh 

258.94 261.66 B: i don't know i think that it's pretty effective i i don't see 

259.09 259.78 A: the thing but 

263.20 265.73 B: i mean i guess they can't screen for everything but 

266.03 267.28 A: right that's true and 

268.03 268.58 A: i mean 

268.74 273.41 A: honestly if you like if you really really think about it if somebody really wanted to take over a plane 

273.97 274.84 B: they would right 

274.00 275.33 A: they probably could without 

275.45 277.30 A: they probably could without um 

277.86 278.30 A: you know 

278.77 279.64 A: bringing a knife 

278.90 279.39 B: yeah 

279.66 283.29 B: yeah if you have i guess the right training you could make a weapon out of 

283.45 285.34 B: other things that they allow you to bring 

283.73 284.10 A: right 

285.57 287.20 A: right like plastics 

286.79 288.19 B: unfortunately i mean that 

288.32 289.06 B: that's true that if 

289.32 290.20 B: if someone has a 

290.48 292.66 B: enough desire to do that they can 

293.86 296.83 B: i don't think there's any way to like guarantee that it'll never happen again 

296.49 299.62 A: do you know if there's like sensors that has like explosives 

300.14 302.68 A: materials th- cause i know metal sets it off that's 

303.28 304.17 A: a given but 

304.60 305.10 A: (( )) 

304.64 307.43 B: they do yeah they do have this thing now where they'll 

307.63 309.86 B: at some airports i know chicago does this 

310.21 310.82 B: um they'll 

310.95 311.41 B: swab 

312.27 315.74 B: random people's bags and then put them in an explosives detector 

316.31 321.22 B: put the swabs in the detector i think they're looking for gun powder residue or something 

316.54 317.22 A: mm 

319.50 320.31 A: right 

322.05 322.49 B: um 

323.23 324.21 B: so i think they do 

324.44 325.27 B: check for that 

325.83 326.72 A: that's interesting 

326.93 327.33 B: yeah 

327.54 330.53 B: right so even if there weren't metallic parts they might still get a r- 

330.85 333.04 B: a width of whatever explosive they were looking for 

333.33 335.01 A: yeah that seems to be pretty effective 

335.23 340.95 B: yeah i i know people get freaked out the guy in front of me in line last time saw them doing that and he thought it was a drug check 

341.73 342.77 B: and he was like oh no 

343.42 344.96 B: i don't know he was trying to wipe all the 

345.22 346.99 B: marijuana off his bag or something 

346.54 348.17 A: oh that is terrible 

347.92 348.41 B: i don't know 

349.97 350.36 B: um 

350.08 350.88 A: that's crazy 

350.80 352.38 B: but ah i don't think they were looking for drugs 

352.50 352.94 A: right 

355.22 355.92 B: ah i asked 

356.03 356.84 B: i asked once and 

357.09 357.74 B: they mentioned the 

357.92 358.99 B: explosive stuff 

358.95 359.73 A: oh okay 

360.41 362.75 A: yeah that that seems to be pretty effective 

363.09 363.46 B: yeah 

364.96 365.70 B: so the um 

366.22 367.42 B: the trinidad thing is really 

367.83 368.16 B: funny 

368.59 370.33 B: ah yeah the people from there are are 

368.70 369.95 A: i know 

370.98 372.27 B: a good catch i can tell you 

372.34 373.27 A: really 

373.03 373.66 B: yeah 

373.63 374.73 A: that that's that's so 

374.19 376.20 B: at least in this one that i have so 

376.45 380.25 A: that's that's really unlikely cause trinidad is so small 

382.70 383.30 B: yeah it 

384.64 386.72 B: it's it's such an interesting culture too like 

387.07 388.22 B: i don't know everyone there 

388.44 390.37 B: either comes from africa or india 

390.48 392.15 A: mhm his grandmother is from in- 

390.98 393.06 B: and ah it's such a cool mix of stuff 

393.22 394.17 A: right his um 

394.31 395.69 A: his grandmother is um 

395.89 396.72 A: from india 

396.93 397.56 A: from india 

397.69 400.06 A: but his grandfather is actually from um 

400.46 400.92 A: china 

401.25 404.18 B: you know what that's true there is a little chinese population there too my 

404.42 404.78 B: um 

405.80 408.83 B: her my wife's sister's brother is is half chinese 

409.75 411.76 B: yeah th- i guess um after the 

411.94 414.04 B: indian laborers came over there the 

414.22 414.82 B: they started 

415.62 417.93 B: um encouraging chinese to come over too 

417.99 418.72 A: right 

418.61 422.01 B: i guess the history of immigration there is all like about forced labor you know 

421.69 423.97 A: right yeah (( i understand that )) 

422.88 423.35 B: and 

424.14 426.59 B: th- i guess they were the wave after the indians you know 

426.84 429.50 A: right and then they were under british rule so everything 

429.79 431.56 A: you know i know the dollars have um 

431.79 432.90 A: queen elizabeth is on it 

433.12 434.21 A: isn't i isn't that how 

433.89 434.45 B: the 

434.60 435.93 B: they have ah right 

436.05 437.09 B: that's true yeah th- 

436.52 437.10 A: (( )) 

437.20 437.75 A: (( ))

452.32 452.63 B: uh-huh 

452.37 452.78 A: so 

453.11 453.54 A: you know 

454.21 454.67 A: that's what 

454.87 455.28 A: they 

456.34 459.18 A: say on you know on exams and stuff that we're black or whatever 

459.44 459.71 A: (( they'll )) 

460.09 460.70 A: both of them have 

460.81 462.31 A: very dark skin so 

462.09 463.31 B: i know it it's kind of a- 

463.62 466.51 B: after a certain point it's like hard to say what you are 

466.40 466.92 A: right 

466.99 468.55 B: on those forms isn't it it's kind of 

467.88 469.25 A: mhm that that's true 

469.36 469.97 B: i don't know 

469.61 472.07 A: that's true but it is it's a very interesting culture 

472.37 472.65 B: yeah 

472.55 473.10 A: and um 

473.80 475.04 A: oh i mean i would love to go

483.24 483.80 A: (( )) 

483.36 486.97 B: i've been there i think once but i didn't stay long enough to really get a sense of 

484.84 485.37 A: really 

487.13 488.75 A: yeah there's nothing about 

488.88 491.29 A: new orleans that's clean to be in a situation 

491.62 493.80 A: where everything is so serene and all the water and stuff 

494.31 494.79 A: that that's 

494.93 495.35 A: kind of 

496.08 496.67 A: interesting
