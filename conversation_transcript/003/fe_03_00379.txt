213.03 213.34 A: all right 

213.62 215.03 A: [breath] there you go 

215.21 219.92 B: yeah so i just did it just out of curiosity and i was under the impression when the person who 

227.62 234.65 B: jumbled her information as far as i was concerned but what i gathered i was going to be talking to somebody part of the 

237.40 239.53 B: i didn't get it that they just linked you up 

239.74 242.04 B: some other participant just like yourself 

240.48 241.19 A: w- with other 

241.32 250.99 A: oh yeah i didn't understand that either i thought what you thought which was that somebody else was going to be asking questions or conducting but there's really no conducting we're just talking 

246.25 246.96 B: right 

263.62 264.55 A: you know what though

277.26 278.16 A: [laugh] 

277.90 285.44 B: whatever they say about cats but you know this may not be a linguistics study where they are looking about phonemes or phonetics it's it's 

285.54 289.90 B: it can be part of an educational thing where they are trying to see how people 

290.16 293.61 B: you know just how they guide conversations 

293.84 298.51 B: you know like we're just examples of how conversations go 

298.17 300.52 A: oh right you're right or how they interact 

300.61 302.60 B: how they interact and 

302.03 303.29 A: how often they interrupt

323.01 323.28 A: [laugh] 

326.36 327.93 A: [breath] 

333.58 340.85 B: they could even be measuring in a discourse something like that you know how many times people use things like that or 

338.42 339.30 A: oh right 

341.73 348.36 B: counting you know the way you use infinitives or it could be used by many departments you know checking 

348.59 350.66 B: all kinds of things and if pe- 

349.91 350.71 A: does that mean if 

350.99 353.36 A: if we do something like start talking like yoda 

353.77 355.47 A: then it will mess everything up

426.48 427.93 B: you know or 

428.27 438.88 B: y- generally like even though the topics meant to be (( )) they might be checking to see whether we talk about the war in iraq i don't mean in any wierd suspicious way just to see if 

439.48 448.47 B: they is some big topic out there that keeps surfacing that people are concerned with or did nine one one affect you or 

448.62 453.59 B: you know things like that and that the pets is nothing to do with it what so ever it's just um 

454.46 458.78 B: you know or even just see what people try and figure out about 

458.94 459.68 B: something 

459.94 464.34 B: like how do people deal with the mystery you know essentially this is a mystery to both

474.76 475.55 A: [breath] 

476.16 483.08 A: you know a friend of mine the reason i did this was because a friend of mine was working on her p._h._d. over in milwaukee and she said

494.14 494.58 B: uh-huh 

496.13 496.75 B: right 

496.48 501.75 A: that you'd have to want to do this i would think because you couldn't even do this enough 

502.01 505.04 A: to make a dent in anything and so you would have to do it 

503.99 504.78 B: no no
