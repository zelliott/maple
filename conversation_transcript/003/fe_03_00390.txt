118.67 119.50 B: well my 

122.59 127.98 B: yeah but they're they're only i don't know they're on other side of the ocean i think that you know if they decided to send missiles 

128.11 132.13 B: you know you know they'd get shot down before they hit the mainland but you know 

131.84 133.19 A: maybe 

133.60 142.31 B: and then you know you got like people like the the idiots from nine eleven you know they could have been filtered out nobody the i._n._s. just doesn't do their job they don't track these people down 

142.61 149.88 B: i mean come on if somebody came from a hostile country and decided they wanted aviation lessons you know somebody should realise that somebody should take notice 

150.10 155.57 A: oh well i do i think they knew i think they had more information they just didn't act on it 

155.61 161.75 B: what you think you think they wanted a a war like what's his name let um japan bomb pearl harbour or 

162.89 165.02 B: maybe a war would be good for the economy

171.69 178.63 A: yeah no you know i think that they'd have suspicions and i think they knew the threats but i don't think they really thought it would happen 'cause i'm sure 

178.82 181.40 A: that our government gets millions of threats 

180.91 183.73 B: oh yeah from from 

182.42 185.17 A: you know and how do you know which one is the real one

188.82 190.74 B: (( i don't )) 

190.75 198.60 B: know i still think mex- mexico we should focus on you know our neighbors more than you know a country that doesn't like like they want to bomb iraq

225.80 232.99 A: i've always wondered why we just didn't in send in a hit man let him infiltrate let him be part of their little gang for a while and then just up and blow him away 

232.48 234.30 B: yeah 

234.10 237.50 A: i've never understood that because you can't tell me it's impossible
