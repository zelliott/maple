4.90 5.89 B: (( hey lauren )) 

6.22 9.19 B: wow what a what a way to start the evening huh 

6.24 7.71 A: nice to meet you 

9.02 10.17 A: yeah 

9.69 10.98 B: [laughter] 

11.28 15.28 B: i actually i don't really understand what perjury means 

15.51 17.95 A: um perjury is ah 

18.39 19.68 A: when you 

20.38 26.13 A: tell a false statement that you know to be false when you've sworn to tell the truth like in a courtroom 

26.75 28.00 B: (( oh oh )) 

28.83 32.19 B: okay somehow i thought it was the opposite i thought it was when you were 

32.34 36.14 B: um turning your parents in or something 

36.24 37.49 B: [laughter] 

37.01 37.98 A: [laughter] 

37.74 39.66 B: (( okay like if the truth )) 

38.62 44.97 A: that would be like ah swearing yourself in to say that a friend was with you when a crime was committed when really they weren't 

45.02 46.00 B: right 

45.66 47.37 A: you would be committing perjury 

47.19 50.21 B: wow well i'm happy to say i've never been in that situation 

49.86 51.79 A: [laughter] me neither 

51.52 56.12 B: yeah right [laughter] you're just saying that because it's recorded [laughter] 

55.40 59.56 A: [laughter] well actually i've never been sworn into a courtroom ever so 

59.35 60.93 B: (( i know yeah )) 

60.22 61.24 A: [laughter] 

61.10 64.38 B: and i missed my jury duty i'll try it again 

63.04 63.96 A: (( tut-tut )) 

64.69 75.10 B: but um yeah well first of all do they still put their hands on the bi- hand which hand the right the left on the bible yeah they still do that 

72.01 73.30 A: (( yeah they use the right )) 

75.28 76.64 A: i assume so 

76.41 80.26 B: and that somehow holds you to your word 

80.92 85.49 A: well i think it's more saying yes i swear to i think the bible thing is just to ah 

85.78 87.10 A: get people who 

86.04 86.72 B: (( it )) 

86.91 88.32 B: it's just a symbol 

88.17 88.89 A: (( yeah )) 

88.62 92.49 B: kind of like if they put the american flag there you put your hand on the american flag 

90.91 96.14 A: yeah you know that'd probably be a better way to do it then we have a separation between church and state 

92.94 94.28 B: [laughter] 

96.41 100.14 B: exactly and nowadays that's ooh that's real 

99.99 100.94 A: yeah 

100.60 108.83 B: controversial you put your hand on the flag then you're you're sworn to everything um now i think ah it really depends on the situation but 

108.90 110.08 B: family 

110.25 112.19 B: yes i would 

112.39 113.47 B: i think 

113.38 115.40 A: yeah i think i would i mean 

116.11 122.71 A: i think i would definitely do it if i thought that the person if i thought that it was not going to protect someone who was guilty 

122.95 124.54 A: then i might have more of a problem 

124.94 134.67 B: right like say your mom ended up with some guy like yeah divorced from your dad ended up with some guy who just beat up on her and she 

134.72 138.96 B: um she dealt with it and um 

139.33 141.99 B: and just pretended like everything was hunky dory 

142.10 150.51 B: but when they came to court you said yes he's fine you know he's a good person and all that because you wanted to protect your mother or something like that 

150.41 155.09 A: yeah something like that i mean if like i know my friend killed someone 

155.33 157.85 A: i would not say yeah they were with me that night 

157.91 158.82 B: oh 

158.09 164.72 A: but i think if i thought that they were innocent but just didn't have a way to prove it in court then i might provide 

164.69 168.78 B: oh i see i see ooh yeah that's a tough one like what if your 

166.28 167.26 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

168.91 170.83 B: family member killed someone 

171.06 172.54 A: right yeah then i'd be 

172.75 174.98 A: (( i don't know i think i'd be a little scared )) 

175.11 176.12 A: (( of how to )) 

176.54 178.56 B: oh like say drugs 

178.88 180.40 A: (( yeah something like that )) 

179.67 182.35 B: where they were involved in drugs and they 

182.55 185.49 B: did it in you know self defence or whatever 

185.65 190.46 B: at least that's what they said to you and you know that the drugs make them tell all sorts of stories 

191.11 192.55 B: but um 

192.74 193.68 B: hm 

194.43 195.76 B: that is a tough one 

196.55 199.72 B: i think if it was a friend it would be easier but family i don't know 

200.01 210.73 B: there's probably in the next topic family or what's it called what does family mean to you [laughter] no what i guess it depends what's more important to your family or friends 

205.14 206.27 A: yeah 

211.48 212.64 A: that's true 

212.75 214.37 A: (( do you have a large family mm )) 

214.36 216.81 B: yes yeah we're a large family so 

216.91 220.05 B: wow if they went off killing people then whew there'd be a lot of dead people 

220.13 222.69 A: [laughter] yeah 

220.77 221.72 B: [laughter] 

222.72 226.85 B: [mn] no yeah and we're not really close you know but 

226.86 228.27 B: you know it just 

228.36 232.24 B: i mean think about like under communism all the people that were turning in their parents 

232.41 233.76 A: yeah that's true 

232.61 236.02 B: to the the party you know so that they could 

236.58 237.58 B: (( ah )) 

237.81 239.87 B: oh and also with um 

240.06 241.68 B: what are those games like 

241.89 246.78 B: like not the murder mysteries but you know where they're they're trying to advance themselves 

247.21 250.98 B: and so they'll step all over the the rest of their family members so they can 

251.01 253.89 B: i don't know be in the last will and testament 

254.22 256.65 A: yeah kind of like survivor 

255.10 256.10 B: (( yeah and i )) 

257.16 262.26 B: is that oh yeah is that that's one of the other topics and i don't watch those kind of thing so i don't know 

260.61 264.21 A: oh really i don't either but i just know that it has something to do with 

264.38 266.69 A: being kind of allied and then 

266.77 268.40 A: screwing over your teammates 

268.14 276.23 B: yeah survival of the fittest and that yeah stepping on others yeah i know last will and testament that wouldn't happen in my family because no one has money so 

269.86 271.09 A: [laughter] 

276.94 280.01 B: obviously i'm doing this ah telephone research 

280.00 281.18 A: yeah 

280.56 285.99 B: [laughter] no i don't know yeah the survivor thing they do that they 

287.50 289.77 B: they like exploit others and 

289.69 293.23 A: yeah i guess so i don't know i you just hear 

289.93 291.93 B: lie to others ooh 

293.68 299.19 A: interesting ah news headlines so and so kicked off someone of some island 

300.01 302.36 A: even though they said they were friends or whatever 

302.55 303.81 B: oh oh that's not nice 

303.13 306.14 A: something so more like a soap opera than real life but 

306.01 307.69 B: (( but it is real life right )) 

307.61 310.80 A: (( yeah well supposedly they want you to think that yep )) 

311.30 314.97 B: but they'll do that just to be on t._v. do they make money of it too 

315.46 316.69 A: they make money 

316.66 317.85 B: (( oh oh )) 

317.86 318.80 A: [laughter] 

318.20 320.67 B: i guess people do anything against their 

321.30 322.19 B: oh 

322.30 326.06 B: that's pretty scary maybe that's what society's turning towards now 

322.46 323.49 A: yeah 

326.34 326.96 A: (( yeah )) 

326.41 329.08 B: just to just to advance in society we 

329.50 331.08 B: step all over our friends 

331.32 331.89 A: (( [mn] )) 

335.35 338.80 B: [laughter] i don't know i've never i've never known that to happen 

338.30 340.64 A: i wonder if it's called perjury if you're bribed 

342.04 343.02 B: (( oh if )) 

342.92 345.04 A: if like your friend pays you to say 

345.21 347.31 A: something it's still perjury 

347.45 351.99 B: your friend pays you why would your friend have to pay you wouldn't it be enough just to have their friendship 

352.50 353.79 A: maybe not [laughter] 

354.01 354.92 B: (( mm )) 

355.34 356.59 B: (( then ah )) 

357.01 358.90 B: i think it's still called perjury 

359.26 360.10 A: yeah 

360.39 362.04 B: happen um 

362.27 363.67 A: what about blackmail 

363.98 369.77 B: blackmail yeah that's another thing then no then you're kind of innocent because then you're protecting 

370.05 371.13 B: you know 

371.07 372.80 A: something or someone else 

372.59 373.45 B: yes 

373.51 378.09 B: then you're actually protecting people but then i guess you are in perjury too 

378.16 379.00 A: yeah 

378.65 379.85 B: (( i don't know )) 

379.09 381.89 A: but i think it's more excusable to like 

382.98 389.95 A: a judge or just society at large because you did it for a good reason like telling a white lie 

388.28 389.14 B: right 

390.25 393.74 B: so basically the answer to the question is 

394.41 395.76 B: [laughter] 

395.91 399.08 B: well okay the question was would you commit 

399.35 401.32 B: perjury against 

399.39 402.28 A: perjury for a friend or family member 

401.58 403.47 B: for a friend or family member yes 

405.22 407.33 A: i think i would for a family member 

407.58 408.46 B: mhm 

408.43 411.56 A: and i think i'd have a bit more of a problem for a friend just because 

412.46 415.92 A: i don't know how many friends i'd have who would want me to do that for them 

416.25 420.08 A: and if they did then i don't know that i'd want them to be my friend 

416.31 417.23 B: yeah 

420.15 421.21 B: yeah 

421.98 423.01 B: definitely 

422.32 423.26 A: (( what about you )) 

423.23 425.22 B: well you're really close to your family yeah 

426.43 427.40 A: (( relatively )) 

427.36 431.42 B: so if anything like that ever happened it would be because they were in dire straits 

431.58 432.88 A: yeah yeah 

432.31 434.05 B: that's the logic behind it 

434.00 435.16 A: yeah that's true 

435.21 437.54 B: we we we know them and we trust them 

437.80 438.60 A: (( right )) 

437.98 439.32 B: yeah definitely 

439.65 446.84 B: i have a i have a friend that you know is really good i can't imagine her ever being in a situation like that but i've had friends that were 

446.95 449.84 B: you know into drugs i'm going back to the drug topic but 

450.09 455.62 B: um that that tends to be a situation you know drug and domestic violence and that kind of thing where 

455.06 456.03 A: mhm 

455.81 459.46 B: it pops up and people are trying to protect their 

459.53 464.20 B: their wellbeing their survival and they have to lie and sometimes you have to lie with them 

464.51 465.21 A: mm 

464.77 465.60 B: um 

466.30 467.86 B: (( yeah and then that happens )) 

469.01 469.82 B: so 

470.95 472.47 B: i guess i would 

472.57 475.29 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

475.52 477.07 B: (( all right now it's )) 

476.38 477.91 A: would they do it for you 

478.58 480.97 B: oh yeah no [laughter] 

481.68 485.65 B: i don't know i'll start asking them i'm going to start asking everyone now 

482.63 484.51 A: you'd like to think so i guess 

485.75 487.11 A: [laughter] 

485.85 490.62 B: good topic [laughter] now i know if you're real my real friend 

490.76 492.12 B: [laughter] 

493.19 494.27 B: (( i don't know )) 

495.12 496.71 B: no i don't know 

497.58 498.66 B: (( my friends are )) 

499.03 501.43 B: i've just got a couple of really close friends 

501.69 505.93 B: but now it's very interesting every time we go off onto a tangent 

506.19 508.41 B: i feel like we're talking about another topic 

508.59 511.65 A: that's true i only glanced at the topics very quickly 

508.77 509.77 B: because there's that 

511.68 513.84 B: oh there's another one about friends 

513.62 514.51 A: mhm 

514.36 518.05 B: like do you tend to have just a couple of really good friends or 

518.08 525.17 B: lots of friends that are just kind of casual and um well i have both but yes they're good friends you know 

519.39 520.55 A: (( oh yeah )) 

525.73 527.28 A: i think you need good friends 

525.86 530.17 B: and oh here's ah here's the difference okay i got it the difference is 

530.48 532.84 B: if you have really good friends 

532.92 536.86 B: i mean i know you're a pretty stable um 

537.03 543.61 B: you know self ah fulfilled happy person you're going to choose friends that are the same 

543.53 544.42 A: right 

544.09 548.42 B: that won't hurt you or end up in situations where you have to commit perjury 

548.35 549.17 A: right 

548.63 551.25 B: whereas if you're family members you know 

551.09 552.78 A: you didn't get to choose them 

551.48 559.37 B: like yeah there's like six of us in my family we all ended up being completely different people it just blows me away my my siblings 

559.58 560.74 B: so like 

560.86 567.05 B: ah even though i love them dearly you know they're nothing like me but still i feel obligated in a way 

567.56 569.28 B: to um 

569.45 574.31 B: protect whatever it is they believe in if it was a friend they wouldn't be my friend as simple as that you know 

569.81 571.42 A: clean up their messes 

573.34 574.34 A: (( right )) 

575.08 575.92 A: yeah 

579.68 580.59 B: yeah 

580.54 581.69 A: (( that makes sense )) 

580.70 584.71 B: so i mean you know there's been times where i chose bad friends but that didn't last long 

584.73 586.46 A: [laughter] exactly 

586.05 587.42 B: [laughter] 

586.74 589.47 A: because you can change them you can't change your family 

589.14 590.47 B: exactly 

589.58 591.02 A: though some people try 

591.63 595.29 B: yeah yeah a lot of people end up in relationships that 

595.40 601.55 B: you know remind them of their family or because they're just they don't have enough self confidence to to get out of it 

601.33 602.38 A: yeah 

602.54 603.31 B: (( so )) 

605.08 606.24 B: (( hmm )) 

606.77 609.10 A: does the computer tell us when to stop 

609.24 611.29 B: is it past ah ten minutes 

611.22 612.39 A: i don't know i 

612.73 616.96 A: haven't really looked have you done have you had more than one of these phone calls 

616.99 617.77 B: no 

617.83 620.41 A: oh okay yeah this is the first one i've gotten as well 

620.20 621.31 B: oh okay 

621.57 622.13 A: (( [mn] )) 

622.07 622.90 B: oh 

623.95 624.91 B: (( i don't know )) 

626.78 628.02 A: i think it i 

630.08 632.51 A: think i remember looking at the clock and it said 

634.78 635.63 A: ten 

636.10 637.79 A: twenty something 

638.35 640.79 A: we may not even be in the t- same time zone 

641.32 644.88 B: that's true as well but there's always the same minutes 

641.36 642.10 A: [laughter] 

645.50 649.51 B: but here's the catch see if you're like in have you ever done improvisation 

649.76 650.58 A: mhm 

650.50 652.05 B: yeah you just continue 

652.54 655.57 B: you don't give up i mean i'm sure it'll do something like that but 

656.31 657.42 B: but you know 

657.46 659.43 B: [laughter] that kind of thing 

659.54 666.55 B: i mean i wonder like what kind of people you meet over these topics and who you end up arguing with and all that because some of these topics are pretty 

666.68 667.95 B: heavy duty 

666.72 670.47 A: yeah that's true but i don't know if people are willing to argue 

667.99 668.71 B: yeah 

670.92 672.48 A: like really argue 

671.12 671.80 B: yeah 

672.76 673.95 B: (( why not )) 

673.96 676.99 A: i don't know it's kind of odd you don't really have a 

675.76 678.58 B: no it's fun because you never have to see them 

678.49 680.19 A: that's true [laughter] 

680.05 688.06 B: [laughter] we could ask all these intimate things it's like we're playing truth or dare and we never have to face each other a- on the school grounds 

688.01 693.66 A: that's true mhm they should never do this in high school they would have a big problem 

689.13 690.15 B: yeah 

693.29 696.40 B: [laughter] yeah do you study ah linguistics 

696.83 697.61 A: (( ah ))

703.61 704.85 A: participating in this 

705.33 706.19 B: okay 

706.81 708.30 B: so you heard about it through 

707.22 708.00 A: (( [laughter] )) 

708.58 710.17 A: (( through a linguisitics person yeah )) 

708.98 709.95 B: (( department )) 

710.10 714.19 B: yeah really it's it's interesting stuff but i haven't thought enough a bout it so
