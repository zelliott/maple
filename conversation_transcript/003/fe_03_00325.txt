0.23 1.41 A: hello 

0.99 2.10 B: (( hello )) 

1.82 3.91 A: hi my name is grameo 

4.05 5.47 A: hi how are you 

5.16 7.15 B: i'm fine my name is penny 

6.74 7.96 A: hi penny 

7.65 8.46 B: hi 

8.29 11.18 A: ah this is actually my first such call 

11.13 16.11 B: (( yeah this is the first time i've tried a few times before but the system hasn't worked very well )) 

11.19 12.33 A: ah [laughter] 

16.12 24.91 B: um in terms of getting through so um ah i haven't done this either before so we're supposed to talk about whether we would commit perjury for a friend 

24.73 28.76 A: yes so i suppose that ah we ah 

29.12 36.51 A: that our friend probably committed some sort of crime and and we know about it and ah are 

36.64 39.77 A: supposed to say that something 

39.88 41.71 A: to hide the fact 

41.14 41.86 B: (( oh )) 

42.21 44.29 B: well gee you know i i 

46.68 58.20 B: i don't think i would do that although i'm not sure i mean ah it's a little easy to say in a you know in the abstraction at a distance but i i i kind of don't think i would 

58.26 60.98 B: ah lie for a friend or 

61.22 61.83 B: (( um )) 

63.19 71.65 B: basically i don't know if it's all for just for good reasons i i think i'm pretty chicken and i i i think i would probably get caught i don't think i'm a very good liar so 

72.22 81.03 A: yeah that that would be my worry as well that that if i did get caught lying then ah then then my friend would go down with ah 

74.53 75.14 B: (( mm )) 

82.81 89.15 A: in in the system much more so than if i hadn't lied i would just try and stay out of the situation in the first place 

84.06 85.06 B: (( well )) 

86.35 88.18 B: well that's right yeah 

88.88 95.00 B: yeah i think that's true i agree i would probably not only not help my friend then but i would probably 

95.11 97.21 B: fundamentally hurt them because 

98.22 99.63 B: (( i don't know the )) 

99.70 110.68 B: in- the inference when somebody lies for you is that there's a reason to lie for you and and that would make them look i mean you know depending on what the situation was it would make them look somewhat guilty so 

110.52 115.87 A: yeah i wonder if i i i i wonder that my friend would even ask me to do such a thing 

116.15 117.30 A: um 

116.92 119.12 B: well maybe they wouldn't ask you too 

119.46 123.97 B: what if they didn't ask you to what if you just were in the situation where 

119.67 122.07 A: oh that's an interesting point 

124.61 131.47 A: where where i just knew that something happened and i thought that if i said something i would incriminate 

127.55 129.03 B: you said might make 

131.20 135.96 B: right or make them look bad i mean it could be that you don't know if they've done it but 

131.65 132.75 A: the person 

136.06 140.03 B: you know you know there if someone asks you you know 

140.38 141.03 B: (( ah )) 

141.09 145.00 B: something and you know that you know that they might have a reason to 

145.14 157.19 A: well i mean it's not just someone asking you perjury means in a court of law after all right and under oath as a matter of fact so you have to have gotten to the point where where you are called to the stand 

149.52 152.61 B: well yeah right right but you can have right 

156.63 158.31 B: well yeah 

157.30 160.87 A: to testify in order for it to be perjury 

160.91 161.63 B: oh 

161.65 169.06 B: yeah that's true that's true but i would assume at some point you would have been interviewed or something i i don't know i don't think i i i i 

166.06 167.10 A: right 

168.35 173.02 A: perhaps i would have been smart enough at an interview to pretend i didn't know anything at all 

172.44 181.99 B: [laughter] well that gets around the but if you thought you wouldn't get caught would you do it 

173.67 176.13 A: (( [laughter] )) 

181.89 183.04 A: um 

183.58 185.79 A: well i don't know 

186.09 193.37 A: i might i it really depends on on what it was that i was lying about and and ah 

194.34 197.34 A: and why and and [mn] 

198.11 202.64 A: what the whole purpose was and what the lie was and so on 

202.89 206.51 A: i mean we we each stretch the truth in various ways 

206.42 207.47 B: mhm 

206.55 211.54 A: for different things and i i if if ah 

212.84 216.50 A: [sigh] i don't know i can't think of a concrete situation where i would 

216.60 217.60 B: mhm 

217.48 222.44 A: but i'm not sure that i would necessarily rule out the possibility yeah 

222.93 225.52 B: yeah i i kind of agree i i don't 

226.88 231.04 B: i don't i don't i don't easily foresee the situation where i would 

231.30 240.46 B: you know either be asked to or know something or you know you know i've never been in that position where i've you know been asked to 

240.51 243.98 B: testify about anything or do anything like that so i 

243.96 248.87 A: i've i've never set foot in a a court i've never set foot in a court 

246.14 247.16 B: excuse me 

249.12 250.49 B: (( never set foot in a court )) 

249.47 251.40 A: a courtroom yeah 

250.85 253.71 B: (( [mn] i've never been involved in any )) 

255.12 258.75 B: i don't think i've been involved in any litigation myself um 

258.81 259.97 B: but i have 

260.12 262.12 B: been in courtrooms but 

262.84 263.84 B: um 

264.07 266.61 B: but more to observe than to ah 

266.62 267.56 A: mhm 

266.70 272.60 B: (( ah than to be ah you know to be asked to do something i don't know it's interesting i you know um )) 

274.05 277.38 B: i don't know how long we how long are we supposed to discuss this for are 

277.41 280.12 B: we supposed to be have a lot to say 

277.43 278.28 A: [mn] 

280.75 293.85 A: i mean there are a fair number of different places to take it i i there's it's all so fascinating now that i think about it ah given that i've never been in a courtroom i wonder if i were suddenly put in one and ah 

283.65 284.32 B: (( mm mm )) 

287.29 287.90 B: mm 

289.97 290.55 B: (( mm )) 

294.39 299.84 A: and put under oath whether i would really be very good at lying ah 

300.52 312.28 A: even however much the attorney had prepared me i suppose the attorney would prepare me ahead of time ah it would be i still question whether in front of a judge i might not slip up 

312.15 316.79 B: mhm or you mean not not lie [laughter] when you intended to 

315.27 316.30 A: yeah 

316.80 319.05 A: (( yeah the truth )) 

318.46 323.82 B: (( [laughter] oh excuse me i really meant to say [laughter] )) 

319.28 321.04 A: [laughter] 

322.68 325.45 A: (( no truly [laughter] your honor )) 

326.01 329.28 A: in reality i meant to say exactly the opposite 

328.40 329.81 B: (( the opposite )) 

329.92 334.03 B: yeah i i guess that i really i do not like lying in general 

333.94 345.59 B: and ah but and i really do sort of mostly believe in telling the truth or avoid telling it if i can't avoid it but i don't like lying and i'm really terrible at it and 

342.85 343.60 A: yeah 

345.87 353.70 B: my face almost always telegraphs if i'm not telling the truth or if i'm comfortable about something so i i just think i 

353.75 356.59 B: i wouldn't i would be the worst person if 

356.85 358.49 B: (( to lie for them )) 

358.82 359.65 A: huh 

358.86 367.71 B: um i mean you know i mean you could imagine there are some situations in which you believe that the system is actually corrupt and you might want to lie for someone 

361.06 361.87 A: yeah 

367.70 369.20 A: yes 

367.73 369.97 B: and there are some situations in which 

369.38 371.03 A: indeed 

370.41 372.28 B: the system is corrupt 

372.05 376.54 A: yeah now there's a situation where i might definitely lie 

373.27 374.11 B: (( you know )) 

376.75 382.10 A: so if ah if it was sort of a matter of civil disobedience 

381.56 383.28 B: yeah for example 

383.01 387.72 A: um where where i was actively involved in the movement 

387.15 388.10 B: mhm 

388.00 396.68 A: where ah some other member of the movement did something that i knew about of course and perhaps would have been part of 

392.78 393.64 B: mhm 

396.58 397.93 B: mhm mhm 

396.83 404.55 A: and i was simply trying to fight the system so so in under those circumstances perhaps 

404.90 406.15 B: all right then 

405.11 408.21 A: but then i think i would be fairly calm about it 

408.11 416.29 B: you you think you would be calm about it i i still think i'm a terrible liar i i just don't [laughter] a good liar 

410.09 410.94 A: yeah 

412.99 417.61 A: (( well all right i'd practice before with a with a polygraph )) 

417.82 425.29 B: right i i think um i i don't know i just don't think i'm that good at telling a story i'd really have to practice it so that i you 

425.43 429.89 B: know i didn't but i could say where there are reasons why i you know 

429.94 433.74 B: would think it was ethical to lie but um 

432.67 433.38 A: (( mhm )) 

433.91 437.96 B: i mean i don't think that's a typical situation but i i do see that ah 

437.62 446.52 A: yeah it's its ah [laughter] there are always situations that that you know that's why i didn't really want to decide outright 

438.34 439.41 B: (( if you you )) 

439.61 440.40 B: (( know )) 

447.15 451.63 A: that make you do one thing or another um i 

452.68 460.01 A: it gets me to thinking how it would be that i'd go about preparing if i if i had decided beforehand that i was going to lie 

458.70 459.60 B: mhm 

460.56 461.40 A: um 

462.10 465.18 A: then then i would want to prepare 

465.26 469.39 A: and do a good job the way i would prepare and do a good job of anything else 

466.43 467.85 B: mhm mhm 

470.01 473.06 A: um and 

473.07 476.65 A: so i i would i could think i would have to learn 

476.67 479.34 A: and put some deal of effort into 

476.87 477.94 B: right i think it 

479.53 481.37 A: lying convincingly 

482.45 491.32 A: that's that's an interesting thing to think about and do i want to put that effort into lying convincingly even before coming up with the situation mhm mhm 

490.68 491.58 B: mhm 

494.17 501.48 B: you know yeah i wouldn't i like i said i wouldn't be too happy about about it just because i don't believe i'm a great liar but 

501.73 502.62 B: um 

502.87 505.66 B: you know i i could see where i might 

506.23 508.08 B: want to ah 

509.00 511.14 B: you know and and i and i 

511.16 520.09 B: i suppose in a way it can be almost a way of civil disobedience i mean you're taking the um risk yourself if you get caught that you will suffer consequence for it so 

520.76 521.48 B: (( um )) 

522.04 524.52 B: and i i i could i could see 

525.16 527.83 B: ah see doing that um 

528.37 530.83 B: (( you know if i if i really thought that )) 

531.47 536.89 A: yeah best way probably be to set up the situation in the first place where no one had to lie 

536.52 538.63 B: [mn] well yeah 

538.87 544.88 B: yeah yeah yeah but you know if you're doing something that that is you know 

544.83 549.33 A: well part of the point of civil disobedience right is that you're 

546.06 546.70 B: mm 

549.68 554.66 A: doing things that you're willing to take responsibility for so 

553.47 554.73 B: (( mhm mm [noise] )) 

554.94 557.01 A: i mean when 

557.02 559.20 A: people organize sit ins 

559.62 566.22 A: it wasn't so much that they organized sit ins and then ran away and tried to say oh we didn't do it 

565.82 566.93 B: mhm 

566.71 574.63 A: they were very clear about yeah we did that and we're going to keep doing it until things change you know [mn] 

575.18 587.14 B: yeah but i i was thinking also about like other situations i'm not really so much you know now i mean what if you lived in apartheid ah south africa during the time of apartheid 

587.22 590.81 B: then it wouldn't be so much civil disobedience 

591.14 596.77 B: as your own firm belief that the system itself was so corrupt that 

596.80 606.23 B: you know what they might be trying to arrest someone for you know was so fundamentally wrong that you wanted to help keep them from getting arrested at all i 

605.68 606.89 A: mhm 

606.28 611.58 B: mean it's a much more farfetched example i suppose but it it seems real to me that 

610.92 611.58 A: (( mhm )) 

612.49 613.42 A: where 

613.87 616.74 A: where you just know that the authorities are out to get you 

613.95 614.86 B: (( yeah )) 

616.60 620.93 B: well right right and and from time to time you do hear stories 

621.04 623.43 B: i mean ah i mean i i 

623.70 635.74 B: you know i don't talk to police in general but i think it is a hard job in some ways i think it's hard sometimes not to get overly zealous and not believe that you for example have already correct person when you haven't and 

635.72 638.78 B: then you know different things can happen 

639.03 643.88 B: that can be terrible for someone i mean i just recently i don't know if you 

644.12 657.30 B: keep track of the news but they recently ah discovered that these kids that they arrested half a dozen years ago or more in new york city for the very famous rape in central park actually didn't do it and 

653.49 666.09 A: yeah i i did see that well they discovered that they didn't necessarily do that particular rape or at least they weren't the only ones but there was some older ah guy 

665.07 675.28 B: well they i don't think they think they might have done some other bad things in the park it wasn't clear they did any rapes but and the guys indicated that that they hadn't participated in it 

668.29 669.66 A: yeah 

673.89 677.37 A: yeah that looked really suspicious because they did confess 

678.06 686.78 B: well but that's the point people do confess to things that they haven't committed because sometimes they're in a situation where they're afraid or they're 

686.85 687.89 A: mhm 

686.88 691.39 B: ah you know so i'm just saying i i can see situations where 

691.48 700.34 B: if i believed my friend and people do do you know sometimes ah out of fear of being told that if you confess 

700.73 705.27 B: you won't get the death penalty we have proof we can whatever 

705.48 710.03 B: you know i i think that you know it does it does happen all the time actually it doesn't happen 

710.04 719.96 B: all the time all the time but it does happen so i'm just saying that if it was a situation like that which is the unusual situation i could definitely see that you know i would want to
