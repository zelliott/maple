61.59 62.18 A: much about 

62.38 64.95 A: the airport security stuff because i don't do a whole lot of 

65.36 65.92 A: flying 

67.08 69.26 B: oh yeah i mean i've done a fair amount of traveling 

67.13 67.50 A: (( have )) 

69.51 70.13 B: since uh 

70.58 72.13 B: -le- uh september and i'm 

72.91 74.08 B: i don't know i would say that 

74.48 75.63 B: i've gotten through with things that 

75.78 78.82 B: like i mean things like nail clippers and like tweezers and i know at first 

79.19 81.04 B: they were saying you shouldn't have and now it's fine 

81.71 83.99 B: but like i traveled in like november of two thousand one 

84.08 84.67 B: and they had it 

85.12 85.61 A: oh really 

85.93 87.00 B: so yeah so i thought 

87.12 91.09 B: things like that make me kind of weary and i'm just like well i wonder how well this is working 

91.53 92.12 A: yeah 

92.44 93.10 A: -cause even 

93.26 94.18 A: my dad just 

94.29 95.48 A: flew back from alaska 

95.63 96.09 A: um 

96.20 97.18 A: like a couple weeks ago 

97.52 100.59 A: and he had a pocket knife in his pocket and they didn't catch it all the way 

99.27 99.72 B: mhm 

100.91 101.96 A: through like three airports 

102.41 103.10 B: oh wow 

102.84 104.27 A: because he just forgot it was in there 

104.53 105.03 B: mhm 

105.18 105.74 A: and 

106.48 110.42 A: they didn't ever catch it so you kind of have to wonder if it's actually helping any 

110.62 111.20 B: yeah 

111.54 113.97 B: no exactly although my sister traveled 

114.44 114.81 B: like 

115.26 115.86 B: i think 

116.59 122.55 B: in maybe like november again of two thousand one or whatever to san francisco and she said that the san francisco airport was 

122.93 123.49 B: um 

123.86 124.93 B: like really really 

125.11 125.63 B: strict 

126.13 129.25 B: they didn't they took away her tweezers they took away her nail clippers 

129.74 130.46 B: um 

130.99 132.97 B: and they wanted every single person 

133.44 133.93 A: wow 

133.74 136.47 B: so i guess it also depends on the airport like she felt really safe 

136.65 137.28 B: while she was at 

137.74 140.52 B: san francisco but then the second she got back down here 

140.95 143.75 B: she flew through newark i think and so newark was just terrible 

144.07 144.57 A: right 

145.43 145.70 A: hm 

146.25 147.65 A: yeah i don't know i wonder if it 

148.42 149.95 A: different on the east and the west coast 

150.35 151.75 B: yeah maybe it just seems like it's different 

152.37 153.57 B: you know like anywhere 

153.88 155.30 B: so that's why you're kind of like well 

156.26 157.61 B: like you just never know 

157.55 158.12 A: yeah 

158.37 159.03 A: definitely 

159.51 160.02 A: probably 

161.24 162.72 A: good in some areas and bad 

163.49 164.41 A: in others like 

164.35 164.85 B: right 

164.72 167.44 A: like it would probably be helpful like flying out of san francisco 

169.32 171.94 B: yeah like if everyone had to go through san francisco it would probably be 

172.53 175.85 B: much better but obviously that's pretty unrealistic 

173.20 174.31 A: yeah 

175.44 176.11 A: yeah 

176.38 176.99 B: huh 

176.93 177.23 A: hm 

179.13 180.03 A: i don't really know 

179.32 179.99 B: but yeah 

181.00 182.39 A: are we supposed to talk for ten minutes 

182.89 185.58 B: i have no idea uh like how do we know when we're going to hang up 

185.64 187.33 A: i don't know either 

187.62 188.19 A: um 

189.00 189.63 A: i don't really 

189.26 189.59 B: i guess 

190.65 191.05 A: huh 

190.70 191.97 B: yeah this is the first time i've done this 

192.24 192.93 A: yeah me too 

194.31 194.88 A: anyways 

194.56 198.53 B: maybe we we just keep talking until come in and say okay hang up now 

198.02 199.27 A: i guess so 

199.94 201.74 B: and if it gets too long we'll just hang up 

201.63 203.41 A: yeah that's probably a good idea 

204.12 204.69 A: it's not 

204.40 206.78 B: i don't really know what else to say about airport security 

206.75 207.71 A: i know i don't 

209.09 211.95 B: i thought well that's something i've thought about that much i mean i have but 

212.85 213.35 A: yeah 

213.09 213.52 B: you know 

215.47 216.11 A: i wonder 

215.54 216.09 B: we don't think it 

216.48 216.80 A: if 

217.58 221.14 A: i'm sure that they start like with airport security if they started doing like more with 

221.78 222.84 A: air marshals and 

223.24 224.87 A: stuff like that it might defer more 

224.05 224.66 B: right 

227.22 229.03 A: that's probably the congress issue 

229.66 231.57 A: with guns on airplanes and stuff like that 

231.15 231.89 B: right 

232.99 235.26 B: oh what ever happened with the pilots getting guns 

235.79 236.95 B: that got passed didn't it 

237.64 239.82 A: i think that i think that they're putting it into effect 

240.38 240.91 B: uh-huh 

240.96 241.45 A: uh 

241.94 243.07 A: but i think it's a whole 

243.60 245.39 A: big thing of like training and 

246.75 251.28 A: who can have them and who can't and they have to do background checks and all that kind of stuff 

247.97 248.71 B: yeah 

250.68 252.77 B: like i'm almost scared by that more so 

253.26 258.02 A: yeah i would i mean it sounds like a good idea until you think about like shooting a gun off in a plane 

257.83 258.59 B: right right 

258.95 261.64 B: or like the consequences of like having a gun on the plane 

261.48 262.05 A: yeah 

262.97 268.38 A: i'm sure if they were trained properly or if there was like air marshals or that type of thing on a plane it probably wouldn't be as bad but 

269.47 270.14 A: i don't know i guess 

270.26 271.46 A: that i'd rather have 

272.27 274.79 A: if there was someone going to crash my plane into something i 

275.52 277.74 A: rather take the chance of trying to shoot them than 

277.68 278.31 B: right 

278.03 279.16 A: not doing anything at all 

281.62 282.74 B: yeah i mean i've definitely 

281.66 282.27 A: i don't know i 

283.24 287.18 B: become like more aware when i'm in the airport and on planes 

288.13 288.80 A: yeah it 

288.73 289.07 B: since 

288.94 292.42 A: the airports are a lot different just -cause like you can't go past security anymore to like 

292.22 292.99 B: yeah 

293.14 295.06 A: meet people at gates and that kind of stuff 

295.93 296.89 A: i don't really know if it 

297.49 299.27 A: i think about it like when i'm flying 

299.63 300.02 B: right 

300.57 303.50 A: i actually fly next week so maybe i'll think about it more after this 

302.95 304.15 B: oh really 

303.62 304.74 A: phone call 

307.35 308.62 A: yeah i don't know that 

310.31 313.04 A: i think that they're doing a lot for like inside the airports which is 

314.35 315.07 A: good but 

314.97 315.61 B: yeah 

315.81 318.07 A: i think it's kind of inconvenient in some ways -cause like 

318.66 321.83 A: i've just reali- like i can't wrap any of my presents or anything like that 

321.98 322.57 B: mhm 

322.58 324.26 A: before i fly home -cause 

324.04 324.73 B: yeah 

324.68 326.09 A: they're going to unwrap them 

326.74 327.52 B: that's true 

327.67 329.74 A: so i think it's just kind of a pain that way but 

330.37 330.76 A: i guess it's 

331.39 332.57 A: for the good of all and 

334.40 335.92 B: i mean there's nothing we can do about it i 

336.44 337.87 B: i feel like i mean you might as well s- 

338.50 339.05 B: whatever 

339.25 340.41 B: suck it up 

340.33 342.49 A: yeah -cause i definitely wouldn't want to be on a plane that 

343.47 344.94 A: decided to get high jacked and 

344.96 347.11 B: right where like no one got checked 

347.15 348.00 A: yeah 

348.68 350.10 A: and i complained about getting uh 

350.23 352.02 A: taking to long at security or something 

354.37 355.17 A: i don't know 

355.60 356.48 B: yeah i don't know 

360.15 362.93 A: so i don't know if we're just supposed to sit here either 

363.51 365.16 A: i wonder if they like don't pay us if we just 

365.70 366.54 B: i know 

366.25 367.96 A: sit here and don't speak for ten minutes 

368.00 371.06 B: like damn it we were a minute away from getting paid 

370.53 372.42 A: i know we hang up the phone 

374.54 375.89 B: my friend actually did it at like 

376.77 379.39 B: uh the first day she got the email so i wonder 

380.48 381.87 B: i should have asked her what she did 

382.22 382.70 A: yeah 

385.28 385.94 A: i don't know 

386.58 388.05 A: i probably should have like read mine 

388.61 390.63 A: more thoroughly and it probably would have told me if i 

391.12 392.66 B: oh i actually have the print out right here 

394.14 394.58 B: um 

397.93 399.84 B: and it doesn't say anything 

399.99 400.29 A: huh 

403.30 404.13 B: um 

405.64 411.77 B: yeah it just says give your opinions and the benefit of your personal experience and please ask about the other person's experience and opinions 

412.43 413.35 B: and then that's that's 

413.74 414.19 B: it 

417.72 418.10 A: okay 

419.20 421.00 A: i don't really have many opinions on this 

421.76 422.56 B: i know 

422.26 422.89 A: topic it's 

424.14 425.14 A: i'm sure it i'm 

425.46 426.99 A: it's really important but 

428.17 428.92 A: i don't know i don't 

430.08 431.27 A: leave that to other people 

432.08 433.25 A: as bad as it sounds like 

434.25 434.71 A: um 

434.55 436.46 B: there's so much money going towards it now 

437.36 438.06 A: yeah 

438.66 439.45 A: it is and 

441.02 441.50 A: seems like it's 

442.34 444.37 A: doing more harm than good in a lot of ways like it 

445.64 448.97 A: a lot of airlines are going bankrupt and that kind of stuff and you wonder like 

448.24 449.18 B: oh i know 

450.13 452.25 A: i mean i guess it's worth it if it's saving lives but 

453.68 454.19 A: i mean it kind of 

453.94 454.50 B: it would probably (( thief )) 

454.62 456.40 B: makes people more paranoid 

456.63 459.25 A: yeah -cause people don't want to fly as much any more and 

458.44 459.01 B: right 

459.47 462.45 A: airlines having to do all these extra things and that kind of stuff 

464.45 467.06 B: yeah i hope you're not flying on um united next week 

467.65 470.19 A: no i'm flying on northwest 

470.64 471.37 B: oh okay 

470.99 471.68 A: which isn't 

472.45 473.38 A: actually probably worse 

473.49 475.15 A: they'll probably lose my luggage or something 

475.72 477.41 A: i have like the worst experiences with them 

478.01 479.62 B: oh really i like american 

480.56 480.91 A: i didn't 

481.25 485.72 A: haven't flown american as much i just moved to the east and it's not as big in the west 

486.24 487.31 B: oh really 

487.21 487.64 A: yeah 

491.08 492.33 A: could be interesting 

492.76 495.32 A: i have to fly all the way across the country so it's going to be a long flight 

495.80 496.95 B: from new york to california 

497.52 500.64 A: um no i'm flying actually from north carolina to idaho 

501.32 502.04 B: oh wow 

503.05 503.46 A: so 

503.64 504.97 A: it's going to be a long day 

505.12 505.71 B: yeah 

507.20 509.35 A: hopefully the airport security and the 

510.27 512.46 A: on airplane security is good too 

512.77 513.35 B: yeah 

515.79 517.67 A: yeah i don't know we'll see what happens 

517.84 518.36 B: yeah 

523.53 526.82 A: so maybe i should have started timing so we could have like counted down 

526.68 527.97 B: i know that's what i started thinking i 

528.18 529.05 B: i have no idea 

529.65 531.02 A: i know i don't i don't know if they'll just 

531.14 531.87 A: cut us off or 

535.19 537.05 A: interesting i guess it's an easy ten bucks 

537.57 538.50 B: yeah 

539.64 544.99 B: i i just read this thing though and it said they can call you up to twenty five times and i'm just like oh my god 

545.77 546.20 A: oh 

547.12 548.29 A: i don't know if i could do that 

548.59 549.44 B: i know 

550.22 551.65 A: it sounds like a good idea 

551.95 552.34 A: but 

553.99 555.58 A: the topics that they give are pretty 

556.66 557.24 A: broad 

557.54 558.08 B: mhm 

558.48 559.63 A: i think one of -em was like 

559.86 561.69 A: if you have any pets or something like that 

562.03 562.33 A: i think 

562.06 562.86 B: oh really 

562.85 563.27 A: yeah
