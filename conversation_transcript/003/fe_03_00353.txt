16.66 18.68 B: (( um [cough] )) 

20.60 25.97 B: well i think that for a business that i might like to be a research consultant 

25.42 26.34 A: okay 

26.97 27.59 B: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

28.91 31.01 A: and how would you go about doing that 

31.42 42.15 B: i suppose the first thing i'd need is a storefront or someplace so that people could call though probably also a web page on the internet so that people could locate me to ask me their questions [cough] 

41.53 42.46 A: okay 

42.28 45.38 B: [cough] and what kind of business would you start 

45.70 46.82 A: um 

46.84 49.10 A: i would probably um 

50.44 57.29 A: ah well i'm studying to be a speech pathologist so i would probably open my own office um 

56.93 57.92 B: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

57.80 60.45 A: possibly specializing um 

61.26 64.73 A: um particularly with children with autism 

64.94 67.39 A: um since i'm doing that already 

67.59 68.94 A: so um 

69.55 71.97 A: i would probably um 

73.14 76.82 A: find a couple of business partners because i don't think i'm a 

77.14 78.08 B: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

77.40 78.34 A: um 

78.39 83.41 A: very good in terms of business and bookkeeping and things like that that i would 

81.29 82.39 B: mhm 

83.48 84.41 A: um 

84.49 89.63 A: want some people to [noise] um join with me in that so 

89.91 96.08 B: would you bring on fellow pathologists or would you bring on a staff that knew how to run an office for you [cough] [cough] 

96.13 104.01 A: um i would probably bring um some people some other speech pathologists but um [sigh] [mn] 

104.19 105.17 A: um 

105.59 108.59 A: i think it would be interesting if i could bring along um 

109.45 116.26 A: like um an occupational therapist and a physical therapist and um somebody 

111.92 112.64 B: (( you'd )) 

116.43 121.79 A: like a special educator um maybe a nurse just a like we would have our own 

122.03 123.19 A: clinic 

123.17 125.31 B: bring on a full fledged clinic [cough] 

123.20 124.11 A: (( but )) 

124.88 126.35 A: right yeah 

128.33 129.21 A: so 

130.17 130.81 B: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

131.32 132.56 B: (( um )) 

135.79 142.49 B: in setting up the business like that how much paper work do you think is involved like would you have to have special permits [cough] [cough] 

143.03 146.86 A: um we- i think we would all have to make sure that we have um 

144.49 145.05 B: (( [cough] )) 

145.33 145.95 B: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

147.13 147.69 B: (( [cough] )) 

148.01 150.31 A: that our licensing would be 

150.35 151.36 A: um 

153.09 164.40 A: acceptable like if if we went to another state if we all got licensed in the state of wisconsin that we would make sure that we were licensed in whatever state we were in um that we were all [noise] 

165.22 167.98 A: we passed all those standards um 

166.39 166.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

168.22 169.96 A: [noise] and um 

172.88 175.24 A: [lipsmack] i don't um 

176.90 178.82 B: i don't know is 

178.99 183.43 B: a speech pathologist closer to being a doctor or closer to being 

183.63 186.01 B: like a therapist or something like that [cough] [cough] 

185.16 196.80 A: like a therapist um it would be working i would prefer we work with children but um working with people who have speech and language problems whether it's a problem 

191.75 193.38 B: (( [noise] [cough] hm )) 

197.30 198.30 A: um 

198.48 201.13 A: with the voice if um 

201.34 204.32 A: you know if there was a singer who um 

204.89 213.21 A: [lipsmack] did some damage to their vocal folds and um need to recover from that or if it's a child that 

213.28 215.89 A: can't produce a certain sound 

215.96 217.66 A: [noise] something like that [noise] 

218.84 223.86 B: interesting i hadn't thought of the singer seeing a speech pathologist before though i guess that makes sense 

224.14 225.04 A: okay 

224.68 226.05 B: um 

229.19 232.25 A: would you want to to be in your business by yourself 

233.54 234.66 B: um 

235.90 241.26 B: i suppose i'd like other partners but i imagine it would be a research generalist kind of thing i m- 

241.56 242.50 A: (( [noise] [noise] okay )) 

242.81 246.31 B: i remember years ago reading in a book about a guy who 

246.89 254.21 B: set up shop as a bibliographer near a university so that sp- he made his living on student end term papers coming up 

254.01 255.06 A: oh 

255.22 263.26 B: and they would come and ask him what sources can i use or i'm having trouble getting this source is there any way to track it down um 

262.11 263.05 A: okay 

263.38 267.41 B: i i've been in grad school for quite a while and i know how to do that 

267.62 270.45 B: (( much better than writing a thesis i've found [laughter] )) 

269.67 271.29 A: [laughter] 

270.57 272.78 B: (( [laughter] so [cough] )) 

273.02 275.11 A: well i imagine that would be helpful 

276.94 281.81 A: do you have something like that in place at the university that you're attending 

283.64 290.22 B: um no there really isn't much of anything like that other than harassing the research librarians [cough] [cough] [cough] [mn] 

289.68 290.57 A: okay 

291.46 292.32 A: um 

292.04 293.57 B: mhm 

292.96 295.22 A: we have something here um 

295.42 308.22 A: that it's called the children's cooperative book center or something and it's like that but it's for um educators who um want it- it's a resource center that um 

308.37 313.25 A: educators if they want to teach about a certain subject um 

313.47 320.97 A: [noise] or want to research a certain topic for teaching their class they can call this um 

321.37 327.25 A: this number and these librarians gather all these materials and call them back with it 

327.40 328.31 A: um 

328.45 329.32 A: so 

328.55 329.11 B: (( [cough] )) 

329.41 330.90 A: i think that would be 

331.12 341.05 A: very helpful um for students or for just people doing research for theses or you know things like that i think that would be 

341.41 343.00 A: that'd be very helpful 

343.62 347.31 B: do they do the actual research or do they tend more to um 

349.81 352.33 B: [lipsmack] simply suggest resources [sigh] [noise] 

352.90 357.33 A: um both i think if if you want um 

358.17 369.83 A: if there's like a book or something that you would like to use in your classroom and it's controversial or something like that these people will do research on it and find um 

370.15 372.57 A: things that other people have said about 

372.98 382.97 A: this book or whether it's from the author or from other educators that have used it or um you know school board rulings things like that they can provide you with that also 

381.41 382.39 B: mhm 

383.27 385.07 B: ah interesting 

384.51 385.60 A: mhm 

386.71 387.33 B: (( [cough] [mn] )) 

387.34 388.26 A: so 

389.14 392.82 A: how much would you expect to be paid for something like that 

393.15 398.39 B: um i suppose it would depend on the request and the number of hours of research 

398.73 399.60 B: um 

401.94 410.97 B: i don't think in the internet age twenty dollars an hour is unreasonable simply because so many things can be found in half an hour if you know how to work search engines and 

410.41 411.22 A: right 

411.02 411.58 B: (( [sigh] )) 

411.94 413.21 B: (( databases um )) 

413.50 414.41 A: okay 

415.46 418.55 B: not like in the book i was reading where the guy had a 

418.89 421.98 B: great big room full of notepads [laughter] because 

422.19 424.49 B: the computer at the time was just um 

425.24 428.39 B: kind of like those atari sixty fours [laughter] 

427.66 428.91 A: oh my 

429.07 431.62 B: [cough] [cough] it's an old book [mn] 

431.72 432.63 A: um 

432.04 432.91 B: um 

435.32 440.20 A: is that something that you would seriously consider though that i mean or 

440.37 444.69 A: is this just like a hypothetical thing or this something that you would actually like to do 

446.13 451.05 B: probably as a sideline to a tutoring business or something like that i'd consider it [mn] 

450.50 451.39 A: okay 

453.61 454.62 A: um 

453.67 455.07 B: yeah or [mn] 

455.39 456.32 A: pardon me 

456.82 463.99 B: before setting up your own speech pathology lab would you rather set up your own or would you rather work within an institutional framework 

464.05 467.57 A: i would rather work in an institution um 

468.03 479.83 A: simply because just starting out i would like to have a support system around me and to get some experience working in a school or hospital setting where i have an idea 

478.69 484.25 B: with other people who have leant the hard lessons [laughter] [laughter] [sigh] [noise] 

481.10 482.88 A: yes also i 

483.12 493.88 A: so i can learn from the people around me and see what works and what doesn't work and that i can learn from those the success stories and you know 

493.95 495.97 A: mistakes that have been made 

495.98 496.96 A: um 

498.00 502.00 A: that i would help me when i would open my own business 

502.57 503.42 A: um 

502.76 503.49 B: uh-uh 

504.51 505.51 A: so 

504.74 510.01 B: so would you see opening your own business as a longer term goal or as something more to do with 

510.62 513.59 A: [sigh] i would actually rather um 

514.00 518.55 A: right now my plan is to be in a school setting um 

518.74 519.58 A: but 

519.99 527.28 A: it would be nice one day if i had the chance to go back to school and i would like to get my phd before i 

527.85 529.10 B: (( [sigh] uh-uh )) 

527.99 528.81 A: um 

529.25 533.13 A: started my own business um just to have that [noise] 

533.45 536.74 A: um in my pocket but um 

535.90 539.00 B: so you can be your own expert [laughter] [sigh] 

537.58 539.19 A: yes exactly 

539.72 549.99 A: um but most of the people that i know that have gotten phds for speech language pathology um do research and that's really not something that i'm 

550.05 555.55 A: interested in i'm more interested in clinical work working with people so 

556.25 557.26 A: (( [sigh] um )) 

558.12 559.09 A: (( basic- )) 

558.17 564.14 B: no i understand that i'm working on a doctorate in french literature and would rather teach people to speak french than 

564.26 569.40 B: make the next big discovery about some author who's been dead a hundred years so [laughter] 

567.97 573.62 A: exactly [laughter] that's how i feel i like people [laughter] 

569.73 570.35 B: (( [sigh] [mn] )) 

573.85 574.61 B: (( [cough] )) 

574.57 575.56 A: um 

576.37 582.48 A: do you know of any people right now that if if you could open this business right now that you would 

582.74 585.03 A: consider partnering up with 

585.62 589.99 B: i have a handful of people that i've worked with off and on over the years 

590.11 594.90 B: the hard part would be convincing them to give up their lucrative jobs that they have now [laughter] 

594.19 595.15 A: oh 

594.95 596.86 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

596.33 598.23 A: yeah that would be kind of a 

598.48 600.77 B: not everybody's still in grad school 

600.38 602.30 A: right exactly [laughter] 

600.84 601.57 B: (( [laughter] )) 

601.89 603.27 B: (( [laughter] )) 

603.84 604.56 B: (( [sigh] [mn] [cough] )) 

605.44 606.38 A: okay 

608.42 609.58 B: um 

610.74 613.76 B: how long have you been studying speech pathology 

613.66 618.24 A: um i'm a senior and doing my i'm finishing on my under grad right now 

618.44 625.21 A: and um so i'm actually sending out letters for grad school now so i haven't started um [lipsmack] 

626.59 627.56 A: the 

628.14 631.75 A: like my clinical rotation are done one um 

631.81 632.98 A: clinical 

633.19 636.28 A: [sigh] um experience in a school 

636.34 638.29 A: where i worked with um 

638.53 641.48 A: one child for a half an hour 

641.60 647.32 A: and um i worked with him on two speech sounds that he could not produce 

647.62 652.25 A: and um i did that for a semester and i really enjoyed it so um 

649.03 649.59 B: (( [cough] )) 

652.30 657.75 A: i think i would rather be in a school than start my own business 

655.81 657.34 B: (( [cough] mhm )) 

657.94 658.89 A: um 

658.34 659.07 B: (( now as ))

662.70 663.57 A: okay 

663.97 664.53 B: (( [sigh] )) 

665.04 671.31 B: ah we spend a lot of our time trying to teach people who are twenty years old to make brand new sounds [laughter] 

671.96 676.50 B: because like the french r. it's not a thing that exists in english 

677.93 678.81 A: okay 

679.13 687.81 B: you know i when i prepare ah course materials and things like that i frequently run into situations where i know that my students can't produce a sound 

687.88 692.70 B: and i don't know whether there would be any application for something like that 

692.15 694.00 A: [sigh] well um 

693.07 697.61 B: a part that people who wish to speak a foreign language perfectly understand [laughter] 

697.95 698.51 B: (( [cough] )) 

698.32 702.72 A: actually um people some people from um that come 

702.95 708.47 A: to our university from other universities um especially um 

708.75 719.96 A: ones um like foreign exchange students they sometimes come to the clinic on campus um to have um accent reduction because they would like to
