186.58 198.55 A: a computer guy he's really young he's like twenty three and he moved up there and he's been there he loves it and and i guess it's less expensive living in the city obviously but it's still pretty bad 

192.48 194.78 B: uh-huh yeah it is pretty cool yeah 

197.79 204.24 B: it is less expensive than uh working i mean than living in man- living for example living in manhattan is probably ridiculous

374.50 379.22 B: most of my jobs are in manhattan so you know it's easy to commute and stuff like that so 

376.06 377.47 A: right 

379.62 383.30 B: although i am a little disgusted with this area um 

383.37 385.92 B: i mean just for career wise i mean i
