53.05 54.20 B: [laughter] 

53.60 61.44 A: what do you look for in a mate and i for one thing i just have to say that stupid show with monica lewinsky is so stupid 

61.39 70.54 A: i never even watched it i don't know what you think but to me that would be like the dumbest thing to do is to try to pick some guy like with a mask on his head 

61.55 62.33 B: (( [mn] )) 

70.48 78.86 B: you know i couldn't watch it either no i i saw the previews and i checked it out for about five minutes and i just thought it was too ridiculous [laughter]

107.52 108.85 A: what do you think 

108.81 123.41 B: yeah it's the whole package for me too i mean i met my husband you know we were eighteen years old and i mean i was actually everyone says this but it was his eyes that i was attracted to first you're a good looking guy 

115.82 116.88 A: wow 

122.05 124.37 A: the eyes are important yeah 

123.74 134.85 B: you know and i think that you know the first attraction is that and then as you grow to know someone it's the sense of humor and the intelligence and all that other stuff 

135.09 135.86 B: but 

135.11 144.00 A: yeah because and like also being friends don't you think 'cause if you're not if you can't hang out together like i i keep seeing these couples around here that are 

138.38 139.35 B: mhm 

144.04 153.66 A: like they're all griping at each other [laughter] and the guys like all complaining when they're at the store and i think how does that woman they're usually older you know 

146.52 147.42 B: [laughter] 

153.78 162.40 A: there's a lotta old people down here um and i'm not saying younger people's relationship is perfect but they just wouldn't pull that shit 

162.71 177.35 A: you know excuse my french i don't if we're supposed to swear [laughter] they probably like [mn] you know they like buzz you um [lipsmack] but like they'll give the wife such a hard time and then she's just putting up with this crap and i think oh my god 

164.13 165.32 B: oh that's okay 

166.09 167.25 B: [laughter] 

177.53 182.20 A: you know i would never stand for that i mean they're just [mn]

182.29 183.16 B: oh that's 

182.36 191.23 A: i don't know my dad had like things that would go that way until certain things and iron them out later but um 

191.37 196.09 A: i mean that's kind of a stereotype but i saw it i'm really from hawaii and then i moved down here 

196.18 204.75 A: and i see that the people over in hawaii are way more easy going and they would never say stuff like that to their spouse i mean they might 

206.22 209.81 A: get mad at home or something but in public they wouldn't be like 

210.69 213.67 A: being such asses you know [laughter] 

213.05 215.05 B: no you know in public 

215.53 228.26 B: we never fight or anything like that i mean at home you know we don't really fight though that's the bizarre part you know we'll disagree about stuff but it's never that you know that 

225.08 226.06 A: yeah 

227.66 230.68 A: like knock down drag like hate each other 

228.35 229.36 B: (( you know ))

255.53 256.88 B: yeah 

256.30 263.06 A: i guess i don't know i don't think i hooked up with anybody in high school because i really thought that everybody there was pretty much a loser 

262.94 264.05 B: yeah i'm 

263.04 271.33 A: oh there was one guy i think that um [cough] later like thirty years later i thought if i would've gone to a reunion 

270.98 271.94 B: mhm 

271.33 280.61 A: i would wanna see him and he he would be the best all around 'cause he was cute and he wasn't like too this or too that and he i don't remember any particular 

275.08 276.40 B: [laughter] 

280.63 292.44 A: group that he was in like he wasn't the super jock like that was all the in crowd in my high school and you had to be in that click or you were like nobody you know what i mean 

291.23 293.04 B: oh god i remember that 

292.41 296.97 A: oh they were just terrible in my high school so i just wanted to get outta there you know 

296.65 301.39 B: i hated high school i was in the band so it was even worse [laughter] 

300.66 302.21 A: yeah 

302.06 305.41 B: and i remember in the caf everyone sat at different tables 

304.96 312.71 A: yes us too it was so cliquish i just hated it i i had no self-confidence i mean i felt like 

305.46 307.62 B: and then we'd all talk about each other 

309.20 310.00 B: yeah 

312.73 317.90 A: i did everything except for in my area where i shined which was art 

317.97 331.41 A: i always wanted to try to be with this crowd that would do like these musical things and i am totally not musical [laughter] but that's how weird high school is that there's these clicks and you think you're a failure because they'll they'll all be like 

324.73 325.80 B: [laughter] 

331.29 333.85 A: we're cooler than you are you know what i mean

334.37 335.51 A: (( [laughter] so i just )) 

335.61 338.63 A: oh man but then in college 

339.46 341.44 A: there was one guy 

341.98 343.33 A: he just now who 

344.05 356.75 A: who would he remind me of maybe like roger dalton or something from the who he was really cute and sometimes i kidded my friends that oh i should've just stayed in wisconsin and married rod 

348.06 349.07 B: mhm 

356.45 357.85 B: [laughter] 

357.19 363.44 A: 'cause he was pretty darn cute you know and that probably would've been good but you you look backwards at stuff and you think 

363.90 369.98 A: what was my what was my perfect match when i was younger and stuff 'cause i kinda miss the um 

370.19 375.55 A: [lipsmack] what do ya call it the window there as far as like doing the whole family thing

379.63 381.40 B: are you you sound very young 

381.02 389.42 A: i'm very young acting and i just don't look at myself as that old and that maybe why i never um 

383.81 384.82 B: mhm 

389.71 392.57 A: [lipsmack] felt like settling down too i don't know but 

392.29 393.30 B: [laughter] 

393.03 394.30 A: (( i um )) 

394.81 396.67 A: i still think that 

396.97 403.16 A: i think it's gonna be more like the soul mate thing because my chinese astrology 

402.70 404.05 B: mhm 

403.48 407.18 A: it's not really astrology it's like that chinese zodiac 

406.78 407.97 B: yeah 

407.37 411.02 A: it hits me way more 'cause i'm a dragon 

410.74 411.94 B: i'm a rat 

411.64 421.08 A: are ya oh with men i'm supposed to be good with a rat and um and i see and it said i'd get married later in life 

412.27 413.17 B: yeah 

414.74 416.01 B: [laughter] 

421.23 426.24 A: and so maybe i'll really get my true love you know i won't have to put up with any bullshit 'cause 

425.64 426.76 B: mhm 

426.46 427.35 A: um 

427.39 438.90 A: [lipsmack] just a couple of the guys that i would've hooked up with that was really really close to really being the you know actually walking down the aisle kinda thing or standing on a mountain top or something 

436.46 437.33 B: yeah 

439.37 440.52 A: um 

440.56 445.62 A: they probably both turned out to be too flaky and it would've been trouble down the road 

446.02 446.78 B: (( mm )) 

446.37 450.85 A: so no i don't know [laughter] 

449.56 450.56 B: (( [laughter] i don't )) 

450.87 454.05 A: what do you what else do you think is like really important 

455.80 457.04 B: know like you said 

458.20 460.95 B: you've gotta be friends and kinda hang out together 

460.77 461.83 A: yeah 

461.21 464.48 B: but i also think it's nice that you have different interests 

464.52 465.77 A: oh good 

464.83 472.24 B: so like for instance my husband loves sports i hate sports but you know what it's a good opportunity [laughter] for him to get away from me 

471.49 483.66 A: yeah 'cause you have to do that to keep it fresh because otherwise i think yeah like my dad hangs on my mom you know he doesn't know what to do he has no hobbies it's always driven her crazy 

484.32 488.85 A: i'm just speaking for my family that's probably why i was afraid to get married 

488.46 489.59 B: [laughter] 

488.94 493.82 A: [laughter] i don't know you know but yeah i think it's really important that um 

494.79 502.92 A: you do have like different things but some things i wanna do like i i really like to swim and i i want them to be a strong swimmer 

502.59 503.44 B: mhm 

503.10 513.64 A: 'cause i i when i go back to hawaii i wanna make sure that i can go out way out with like my boyfriend one of my boyfriends would do that with me and i really appreciated that 

513.34 516.60 B: yeah i've never been to hawaii 

516.69 517.86 A: it's really nice 

516.79 519.81 B: and that's always one of the places that i wanted to go 

519.21 520.71 A: oh you should really go 

521.04 525.81 B: but you know i've only vacationed in florida and i love florida 

521.17 522.47 A: i mean they really 

525.99 526.81 B: but 

526.23 533.09 A: florida is really nice but i'll tell ya one thing [laughter] it's so damn humid here i mean i'm i've taken three showers today 

533.15 545.98 A: i don't wanna i can't turn on the air conditioning 'cause i've got like this really bad stiff neck from it and so and now i'll probably have to go take another shower you know before i go to bed 'cause i mean you just sweat the sweat's just pouring off of you 

538.20 539.17 B: uh 

546.16 548.33 A: so it's probably going to get worse 

546.94 548.88 B: (( [laughter] [mn] [noise] )) 

549.42 551.24 A: is that your little baby 

550.73 552.52 B: yeah it's my 

551.68 553.46 A: how old are your kids 

553.15 556.50 B: i have a three and half year old and a nine month old 

555.88 558.91 A: oh wow really young ones 

558.52 560.32 B: yeah 

559.52 566.67 A: cute i bet well i mean you guys are solid and that's neat that's what it's all about to have the whole family thing 

560.71 561.67 B: (( [laughter] )) 

566.99 574.67 B: yeah i mean we waited a while i mean not with the intention of like we'll see if we stay together [laughter] but i mean we waited a while we wanted to be 

569.40 570.44 A: yeah 

574.82 576.58 A: that's really good 

575.78 581.05 B: you know make sure we could provide for the kids and not have to worry about things and 

580.49 582.88 A: that'd be good if more people would do that 

582.36 585.45 B: i i didn't want to be irresponsible [laughter] 

586.71 589.19 A: well how old are you if you don't mind me asking 

588.55 589.65 B: i'm thirty 

590.29 591.91 A: perfect age 

591.39 593.49 B: yeah it is a good age 

592.63 594.42 A: 'cause you're mature enough 

594.31 595.67 B: [laughter] 

594.65 595.66 A: you know 

595.73 596.78 A: it's like i 

596.99 599.89 A: mean you don't wanna wait too late either otherwise
