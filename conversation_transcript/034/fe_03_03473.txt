73.50 76.30 A: yeah well what's life without dancing eh 

75.98 77.25 B: that's true 

77.24 85.32 A: yeah no i agree with all the things you mentioned i think they're pretty pretty simple things but they get overlooked 

85.33 86.77 A: a lot you know 

87.37 91.83 A: you know people go for you know looks and stuff like that and 

91.23 92.32 B: (( true )) 

91.99 93.01 A: doesn't 

93.13 95.21 A: that fades but you know 

94.83 96.30 B: that's true 

95.45 97.44 A: personality and 

96.70 100.17 B: i'm i'm shallow in that they need looks too [laughter] 

99.30 101.33 A: (( [laughter] yeah i know )) 

101.79 103.49 A: it's a good start 

103.71 105.10 A: you know like 

103.75 109.89 B: i guess i guess uh chemistry is what what i would say chemistry so 

109.69 115.50 A: yeah and i guess that starts off with how someone looks you know if you're not 

114.36 120.23 B: beauty is in the eye of the beholder what might be attractive to one person might be hideous to another 

120.31 125.34 A: well yeah that yeah that is true i had a girlfriend and she was never 

125.41 127.20 A: the greatest looking uh 

127.32 130.06 A: you know girl in high school but like 

130.33 137.40 A: well she was probably like at the bottom end but she was like going out with the head of the football team and you know 

136.48 137.33 B: right 

137.60 147.06 A: like the best looking guy in the high school and i could never figure it out but she had a really up going personality and i guess that's what made you know 

146.21 149.93 B: well she might've had what's called sex appeal too 

150.55 153.00 A: mm yeah maybe [laughter] 

152.42 165.54 B: well you know some people that that aren't necessarily um the most gorgeous individuals they've got sexual appeal and that just like takes over and it's like then you just don't know what the heck's going on you're like wow 

163.03 164.18 A: (( [noise] i )) 

166.20 168.97 A: hope i didn't screw that up i dropped my phone [laughter]

171.35 172.91 A: yeah so um 

173.49 178.62 A: yeah not sure what you know what else to say about life partners but 

177.88 181.26 B: well i think they need to uh 

182.94 194.00 B: make time for you like i wouldn't i wouldn't be with somebody forever if they weren't making time for me there wouldn't be a point 'cause like if i wanna get ignored i can do that being single 

194.32 202.99 A: well that's yeah i i belong to this it just made me think of something like i belong to this internet like chat group and uh 

203.09 213.21 A: this one girl like we all share the same kind of medical problem like we have fibroids like which is really like nothing you know serious it's not 

212.31 213.19 B: (( like tu- )) 

213.72 214.74 B: tumorous 

214.40 220.24 A: yeah fibroid tumorous yeah well they're called tumorous but they're not you know like cancer 

219.72 221.19 B: i know what they are 

220.75 234.95 A: and one girl said her boyfriend told her like i don't like wanna deal with this like you were so strong and everything before and now you're weak and i don't want somebody who's weak in my life and 

234.36 235.43 B: right 

234.78 236.67 A: i thought god [laughter] 

236.71 238.77 A: what's this guy thinking you know 

238.80 241.90 A: like i mean you have to be there to support someone 

241.98 243.84 A: like no matter what 

243.47 251.22 B: yes certainly so unconditional love and support is definitely that's that's a good point 

248.56 249.76 A: yeah 

250.09 252.05 A: is the key to you know 

252.09 254.69 A: a lasting relationship so do you think 

255.29 256.78 A: if you uh 

256.86 260.03 A: get married you'd be married for life 

261.28 262.98 B: if i was to get married 

262.30 263.37 A: yeah 

263.80 265.91 B: yeah i do because i'm 

265.99 274.34 B: i'll be thirty three soon and i've never i've never uh been married and so 

275.02 276.51 A: (( right )) 

275.66 281.71 B: not even like a consideration right now so i think if i ever did i might be forty 

281.78 294.70 B: forty five i i think by that time i i probably would have a good a good idea that i'd be ready to be married and you know that i'd wanna spend the rest of my life with that person you know 

283.48 284.29 A: (( [laughter] )) 

294.87 302.25 A: right so have you had any like significant relationships like for like for a long period of time or 

301.93 303.73 B: three years three years 

302.83 304.01 A: three years 

304.44 311.04 B: yeah and i think another thing on the subject about it is uh i uh 

312.11 314.60 B: i think out of uh 

315.71 324.82 B: another person i would want would be somebody that's adventurous i guess i said spon- spontaneous and stuff but uh adventurous 

321.70 322.92 A: right

343.39 345.64 A: (( yeah that's )) 

344.09 344.87 B: i

348.11 349.34 A: right 

348.71 354.25 B: know because i'm i'm into it and i i don't wanna be slowed down by somebody who 

354.35 359.92 B: might be out of shape or something if i wanna go go do something let's go do it you 

360.02 360.81 B: (( know )) 

360.55 372.56 A: yeah that's true 'cause i go hik- hiking almost every day and like i can't [laughter] get anybody to go with me 'cause like they're like no you go you know you climb too many hills and so long you know it's like 

372.04 373.70 B: where are you from

393.29 400.35 A: yeah and i can never go get anybody to go with me [laughter] but that's okay i don't mind going alone you know 

399.89 406.89 B: yeah sometimes it's hard to find somebody to go with i know that not everybody is into it 

406.45 413.13 A: yeah well that's the hardest like on this topic like it's like finding someone whose like compatible like 

413.23 417.43 A: in a lotta respects with the things you like to do or 

417.15 419.35 B: yeah compatibility

469.71 471.62 B: i'd prefer a nonsmoker

473.17 478.58 B: although a lotta my girlfriends have been smokers if i would've limited myself to um 

479.48 482.36 B: people that didn't smoke i would've dated a lot less 

482.28 497.25 A: yeah see i i that's like on what you just brought up like people who are too like specific about things like say i met a guy and he says well i can't smoke and i want you to drink and like you know it's like i don't want you to do 

493.46 494.37 B: right 

495.37 502.70 B: right right well yeah i've learned that i mean i'm just saying that in an ideal world 

501.95 503.28 A: world yeah [laughter]

506.31 507.42 A: mhm 

507.43 509.47 B: what it would be so 

510.22 512.70 A: it would be definitely nonsmoker for you 

512.55 520.67 B: it would be it would be hopefully a nonsmoker yeah light light drinker like me not somebody who lushes it up all the time 

515.61 516.98 A: yeah 

519.96 521.54 A: yeah right
