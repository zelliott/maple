20.46 25.83 A: [laughter] uh about life partners i understand we're talking about 

25.22 26.70 B: yes i think so 

26.62 29.31 A: okay and what's most important in a life partner 

29.91 32.36 B: the ability i think to communicate 

32.43 36.65 A: oh absolutely it's funny you should say that as we're definitely trying to communicate 

36.49 37.44 B: um 

37.18 38.11 A: [laughter]

47.99 49.09 A: right 

51.07 53.62 B: what what do you think i guess [laughter] 

52.77 57.51 A: well you know i mean communication is key because if people 

58.19 71.77 A: are trying to understand each other if they can't communicate then they'll never get their point across but but even also with that has to come i think friendship and trust and honesty which is always an interesting 

62.53 63.44 B: right 

72.10 78.51 A: mix to try and get from the male species [laughter] but that's just my own personal view 

75.67 76.59 B: uh-huh 

78.22 79.25 B: yes 

78.60 83.05 A: other than my my current husband that's been my personal experience 

83.70 87.65 A: um so you know yeah i think you kinda need a mixture of things because 

86.73 88.48 B: mhm 

87.87 98.68 A: people can't be just one thing they have to be uh you know this big mix of they have to be open and honest and your friend and willing to willing to put up with you 

98.36 101.87 B: [noise] yeah yes well 'cause you're not gonna always 

98.97 101.10 A: [laughter] 

101.94 103.58 B: and i guess grow with you 

103.56 104.42 A: yeah 

103.61 106.31 B: too you know 'cause i think um 

104.50 105.47 A: yeah 

106.74 109.86 B: my prior relationships and everything you have to 

110.55 119.48 B: you are very like maybe immature when you get together and as you grow you know do they grow with you or do you grow apart 'cause i've heard a lotta people 

113.90 114.84 A: mhm 

119.46 127.50 B: talk about that you know i matured they didn't or i over matured and they stayed the same or you know um 

120.67 121.64 A: right 

125.43 126.56 A: right 

126.89 131.70 A: yeah a lotta people grow apart you know i think part of that may be the fact that we just don't 

131.86 143.67 A: get to know each other as well as maybe people used to or you know what i mean if you think about it way way back when people didn't have all these outside activities they had to get to know each other 

134.82 136.45 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

143.05 156.91 B: yeah you have to stay home or you know and talk or you're you're doomed you know and there's so like you said there's so many gadgets now there's the t - you know t._v.s and computers and you know games and 

145.31 146.27 A: right 

157.20 161.23 B: there's so much other stuff to do other than sit and talk and [mn] 

160.60 168.85 A: right and and the problem is people just get caught up in that you know i i look at my kids and left up to them they would never go outside 

169.12 173.63 A: and it's it's just the society that we're living in currently 

173.18 174.25 B: yeah 

173.56 184.62 A: you know and and you just really you've gotta step back from all that and you know as far as a relationship goes you've gotta get away from all that outside stuff and and remember that there's another person there 

183.97 189.29 B: yeah yeah there's always the other um what does the other person like and i 

189.70 195.36 B: i do think and like you said you have to um we don't i don't think and i personally 

195.52 204.21 B: didn't take e- enough time to really get to know a person before you say hey yeah we'll get hooked up or married or whatever the answer isn't you know it's 

201.66 203.67 A: so right right 

204.22 215.69 B: it's more of let's hurry and get together and you know do things that you wanted to do at the time but you don't think long term and 'til you get with them you're kinda like oh 

212.99 214.48 A: right well 

215.23 218.16 A: uh-oh yeah [laughter] what was i thinking 

215.68 221.98 B: yeah what was we doing at the time or you know things like that so 

221.20 228.69 A: well you know it's it's it's two things we're into instant gratification everyone wants everything right now give it to me now 

225.67 226.80 B: mhm 

227.49 229.05 B: mhm 

228.74 239.86 A: and then the other thing is that we kinda live in a disposable society from disposable pens to disposable marriages my sister god bless her got married 

235.37 236.27 B: mhm 

239.92 249.08 A: they went to the justice of the peace to get married because he's a teacher and it was a small town and they said well [laughter] you can't live together and not be married you know 

248.14 249.09 B: right 

249.09 260.43 A: and so they got married and then a year later they went down the church aisle and everything and they got married again and it was very nice and six months after the second wedding they were divorced what were you doing 

258.22 259.10 B: mhm 

259.12 262.73 B: yeah it's so easy now 

262.36 269.57 A: that's the problem it's too too easy you know oh we don't get along let's get divorced um or hey you know

281.73 282.85 A: right 

281.80 287.17 B: [noise] 'cause people would look bad you know you got divorced ew you know that's that's a bad thing and

302.63 314.80 B: it was a bad thing and she still wanted to be in church and stuff and you know you just didn't do that you know and um it and now it's it's still accepted either way 

308.19 309.22 A: right 

315.10 323.39 B: that i it's just too like you said it's more convenient and easy it's too easy to get divorced too easy to get married fast and

342.72 343.72 A: right 

343.09 348.46 B: you know before you got married and i don't think anybody has to do that anymore you know 'cause it's 

346.39 347.11 A: no 

348.77 354.93 B: convenient you know and that stuff don't matter anymore it should but they say it don't so 

354.13 366.23 A: well yeah i hear ya there's a lotta things that don't matter that should and that's why that's why you can walk down the street and shoot some little old lady because you don't know her it's a lot harder to walk down the street and shoot mrs johnson
