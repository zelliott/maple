59.18 61.12 B: yes that's true 

69.71 74.62 A: um it's just completely different and it's like a shock to the system 

74.60 76.23 B: (( uh-huh [sigh] right )) 

75.26 80.47 A: i mean i came from a middle class family and um 

78.30 79.27 B: uh-huh 

80.59 85.74 A: raised in the sub- suburbs uh my husband came from a rural area 

85.45 86.75 B: uh-huh 

86.18 98.62 A: and it's we're so different it's like wow this is really it's you know you you you meet somebody and fall in love and you think wow this is great 'cause you're in love but once you get married and the reality sets in you 

95.55 96.42 B: yeah 

98.66 102.33 A: you there's so many issues that you didn't think of

102.44 104.06 A: beforehand 

104.09 111.94 B: that's true yes and uh we came from two religious different backgrounds also so and also two economical backgrounds so 

105.40 106.93 A: yeah 

111.87 121.51 B: um i had to learn how to cut back more [laughter] in anything in order to survive and i think i cut back more than anybody now

121.64 125.39 B: [laughter] still do after twenty seven years so 

125.14 130.95 A: i i think um the same intelligence level um [lipsmack] 

131.55 137.75 A: uh i'm not even gonna say education because a lot of very smart people didn't even go to college 

137.46 138.90 B: yes that's true 

137.95 143.65 A: but um i mean i think that you all should be should be able to handle the same things 

143.30 144.44 B: mhm 

144.10 145.09 A: um 

145.47 151.20 A: i i know that you know to marry some guy who has a i. q. of a hundred and eighty 

151.30 157.08 A: and they know everything it it would probably be miserable for me um 

153.66 154.58 B: yeah 

157.17 160.86 A: you know i'm not saying i'm super smart or or or dumb 

160.89 164.83 A: but i i just couldn't imagine not being able to hold a 

165.06 167.58 A: [noise] conversation with that person 

167.59 173.43 A: um obviously communication is one of the most important things to maintain in a relationship 

173.21 183.92 B: yes it is and then also but sometimes they can balance each other out too you know um the other person might have more of the brains and you might have more of the um 

184.14 187.24 B: the physical and handy part 

187.12 188.43 A: [noise] mhm 

187.28 192.77 B: and creativeness that the other person doesn't and this is how it is with us 

192.96 198.08 A: well i think um like my parents just celebrated uh fifty one years 

197.68 198.91 B: oh wow 

198.62 201.94 A: and uh he's really intelligent 

201.71 202.94 B: (( mhm )) 

202.19 204.48 A: um book smart but she 

204.67 206.52 A: is more street smart 

206.18 207.53 B: (( mhm )) 

206.80 208.68 A: and as far as um 

209.11 214.04 A: like i'm the youngest of nine so she knew how to stretch the food and 

212.87 213.92 B: right 

214.12 228.08 A: and recycle the clothing and and different things like that and he was he would just get out and make the money and it they balanced each other out um she actually paid the bills and and her you know her um [lipsmack] 

219.98 221.16 B: mhm 

228.56 231.02 A: philosophy was just pay your bills on time 

230.90 232.37 B: (( right right )) 

231.78 236.21 A: i mean she didn't know about investing and then that's the thing he 

236.22 239.87 A: you know to thought about retirement and things like that 

239.57 240.86 B: mhm 

240.29 244.56 A: so um they ended up balance balancing each other out they 

244.63 248.65 A: acquired the same interests after they got married i think 

248.54 251.38 B: right yes well you do you grow together 

251.59 252.66 B: (( in a sense )) 

251.63 252.94 A: so i mean 

253.11 256.04 A: now they they just like to fish and 

256.08 257.42 B: oh really 

256.54 261.63 A: [laughter] yeah [laughter] we live in virginia 

257.98 259.57 B: where do they live 

261.04 262.53 B: oh okay 

261.64 274.29 A: and their vacations consist of staying in a uh cabin at their timeshare and they they go fishing and they eat lunch together and i mean they don't i mean she doesn't like to do a lot of shopping so that's 

274.74 275.81 B: (( ha )) 

275.04 278.80 A: some of their some of their they're not different in that aspect [noise] 

278.81 285.07 B: wow yeah well i'm waiting to see what's gonna happen with us when we get there [laughter] 

283.08 286.83 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

285.56 293.39 B: although i'm home pretty much of the time although now that uh the kids are grown i have gone back to work a little bit part time so 

293.63 296.49 B: [lipsmack] it brings a little extra money in but uh 

296.58 300.66 B: it's it's been a change since i've been home for so many years 

301.13 306.48 A: i think another thing um another issue to look for is somebody who is 

301.53 302.32 B: yeah 

306.53 308.28 A: grounded um 

308.39 314.40 A: not somebody who's gonna be married for five years and then all of a sudden they need to find themselves 

314.17 315.56 B: right 

315.10 323.85 A: and i mean you've you know you've got somebody who's focused and and you know they've they've done their amount of partying or whatever 

324.16 336.25 A: and and they're ready to to stay focused and stay on point i think that's a big issue um i think a lot of young people go out and get married at eighteen nineteen oh we're in love 

328.55 329.67 B: correct 

336.33 342.09 A: and then one decides oh well i didn't get to go away to college and party with my friends or 

341.32 343.02 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

342.27 346.90 A: and and you know then they find themselves stuck and i think that's a lot of 

346.96 347.52 B: (( [noise] )) 

347.33 351.71 A: a lot of the divorce issues nowadays that people didn't wait 

351.58 353.59 B: right i agree 

353.64 357.40 B: although we were married young but i think that we were um 

357.43 361.44 B: we were both well grounded and we had the same goals in life so [lipsmack] 

361.64 363.57 B: that worked out for us 

363.89 366.29 A: yeah i've got a niece who's uh 

366.53 370.56 A: twenty three and she's been married for three years 

367.79 368.76 B: (( mhm )) 

370.05 371.20 B: uh-huh 

371.02 375.15 A: and her husband doesn't seem to be finished with his partying 

374.97 377.17 B: oh well that's kinda hard 

375.73 376.81 A: so 

377.10 384.31 A: he's there sometimes he's not you know he's she's trying to keep a roof over their heads and they've got little children 

384.45 385.36 B: (( mhm )) 

384.64 386.55 A: and i mean 

387.17 389.64 A: it if you're gonna stay married 

389.73 392.30 A: at some point you need to decipher 

392.96 395.49 A: what you want [laughter] 

394.30 396.29 B: right you need to grow up 

395.67 401.62 A: yeah and um i think i think th- that's where a lot of people make their mistakes in finding a partner 

396.36 397.43 B: yeah 

401.71 406.33 A: they you know this guy's cool he's cute a- and 

405.10 406.00 B: mhm 

406.50 412.44 A: then they don't realize that he's not really ready to be responsible or she's not ready to be responsible 

412.63 417.44 A: so um that's that's i think that's really important i always tell my daughter 

417.88 424.79 A: just make sure you know that person really well just wait don't rush into anything if they love you they'll just wait 

424.51 428.07 B: yes i agree with that that's very important also 

429.99 433.97 A: [noise] and also um i have a daughter that's fifteen 

433.75 435.16 B: yeah oh my goodness 

434.39 447.42 A: i always tell her um get your partying done before you get involved if you wanna go to the clubs with your friends or you wanna travel to europe during the summer or whatever 

440.31 441.63 B: [laughter] 

447.10 448.06 B: uh-huh 

447.51 458.56 A: get that out of the way before you decide to settle down because your husband's not gonna understand that your girlfriends are going to to miami for three days and you wanna go that's not gonna work 

456.69 457.59 B: yes 

458.15 460.45 B: (( no definitely not )) 

460.48 469.78 B: so yes i have a daughter in in college also and she's at the point where she is just partying along and [sigh] doing that but hopefully she'll get that out of 

460.65 461.49 A: so 

469.76 471.22 A: (( [laughter] )) 

470.88 484.59 B: [laughter] the way now my son he has a child and uh he had to grow up real fast in order but he's very responsible so that uh he partied a lot but now he that he has a baby he's very responsible and uh 

484.72 487.69 B: it's very important and it has stopped his partying 

487.98 500.40 B: and goes to work you know and very ambitious so and i think he is realizing his goals although college is taking longer than what it was supposed to but uh i think now that he has realized that 

488.28 489.33 A: yeah 

500.56 502.55 B: uh everything that we have taught him 

503.48 507.03 B: was the real thing the real world and 

506.35 507.32 A: (( yeah i'm )) 

507.39 518.45 A: i think a- another really important issue is just to be realistic um not everybody is gonna be like daddy you're not gonna find men like daddy 

515.13 516.06 B: no 

517.77 518.78 B: (( no )) 

518.57 530.47 A: so um and that and that my sister was actually saying that to me last week um she's like that's our problem we all thought that all the men were gonna be like daddy and that's just not the case 

530.14 534.34 B: no that's true [laughter] or like mommy 

531.25 537.18 A: so [laughter] yeah and um you 

535.10 536.10 B: yeah 

537.35 545.33 A: know even though you might meet somebody who's your equal intellectually and you know you share some of the same interests 

545.48 550.01 A: um there's gonna be something that comes out down the road that 

550.10 554.17 A: you know you are gonna be like this this isn't what i signed on for 

553.68 561.52 B: mhm mhm and i see that with my son and his girlfriend because he's a neat nick and she just doesn't uh 

561.53 576.49 B: pick up and then my daughter's living with him also and uh she's not a neat nick either and he gets very frustrated like that because we were both very uh [laughter] neat and organized and with the two not being organized it's just it's frustrating the heck out of him 

571.74 573.66 A: [laughter] 

576.59 587.82 B: and uh i'm saying see you see what i went through [laughter] now so but uh yeah in fact he does pretty much all the housework [laughter] in the house 

581.99 583.12 A: yeah 

587.71 588.43 A: (( that's )) 

589.21 594.45 B: [laughter] [lipsmack] it's very interesting and i just kinda sit back now and just kinda laugh and say okay 

589.36 590.23 A: [laughter] 

594.67 597.99 A: that's strange that the son would be the one 

597.75 599.89 B: mhm oh yeah
