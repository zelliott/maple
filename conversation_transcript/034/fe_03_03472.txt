121.11 122.45 B: let's share then 

122.59 135.49 B: i've i've i've been with this girlfriend for about ten years this year yeah so the best thing about that is uh she understands me she she really complements me and uh she supports whatever i do 

126.28 127.51 A: (( mhm really mhm )) 

135.58 141.58 B: and i think that uh the only thing is to have someone to talk to and not not to argue with [laughter] 

141.71 152.44 B: yeah so i mean she she listens and then she gives her opinions and and she respects my decision most of the time if she doesn't agree she'll tell me that's what i like 

141.90 143.53 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

152.01 153.22 A: yeah yeah 

152.60 158.71 B: right you want somebody who who doesn't say yes all the time and helps you become a better person like you were saying 

158.46 159.45 A: yeah 

158.92 163.15 B: yeah so what do you actually i mean since you just broke up i i 

163.61 168.62 B: if you are going to get into a new relationship um what kind of 

169.45 176.82 B: i'll i'll rephrase did you break off with the last one because she didn't she wasn't what you looked for 

176.83 178.33 A: oh no it was it was 

176.89 179.55 B: or if if you don't mind talking about it 

178.99 184.24 A: oh not a problem i was it was more of a location thing i mean i really i really cared for the girl 

179.86 180.71 B: okay 

184.03 184.90 B: okay 

184.32 187.89 A: uh i mean i'm graduating and i'm going to grad school

201.40 202.17 A: she's 

203.54 208.62 A: yeah and i i didn't really really wanna become i hate to say it but i didn't want to get too attached to her 

208.33 209.30 B: okay 

208.91 213.88 A: so when the b- when we did break up like later on this summer say before i left it would be much harder 

213.93 215.60 B: right

292.48 307.08 B: [laughter] no she always um i'm lucky in the sense that uh we always talk everything out and then even we we almost never quarrel because whenever i mean we have quick if i sense that she's not not feeling 

306.98 313.89 B: good about what i say or what i do i'll basically ask her what's wrong and she's the same thing so basically we we talk
