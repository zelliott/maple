53.37 56.72 B: [noise] [noise] it um [noise] if you don't share 

56.87 67.29 B: [noise] the same values or [noise] similar views on things then [mn] you're going to [noise] just keep butting heads [laughter] when you're trying to raise your children 

67.33 74.66 A: [sigh] yeah and and i think temperament too you need to look for somebody uh [sigh] probably of a a similar temperament 

68.23 69.28 B: (( [noise] )) 

70.88 71.80 B: [noise] 

74.79 78.91 A: uh because if you're very easy going and you wind up marrying uh [sigh]

78.93 80.30 B: [noise] 

79.19 91.44 A: uh someone who is just hard to deal with or vice versa or you know someone who winds up being like a control freak or something i i could see there being problems there too you know kind of balance y-you know um one can't be more controlling than 

80.52 81.77 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

81.88 83.83 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] 

89.23 90.12 B: [noise]

96.17 97.03 B: (( some )) 

97.04 99.60 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

99.63 100.73 A: (( the other yeah )) 

100.14 100.93 B: this 

101.01 108.92 B: it's just going to make [noise] the one that is more laid back just unhappy [noise] because [laughter] they're being pushed around [sigh] 

108.40 117.76 A: yeah [laughter] [sigh] yeah and i and i think you have to have similar goals you know not necessarily identical but [sigh] uh where you're heading in this life 

109.11 110.28 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

112.78 113.53 B: yes [noise] 

118.51 122.07 A: and and how you intend to get there that sort of thing 

121.45 125.97 B: right and [sigh] i think uh your values kind of lead you there 

126.50 127.67 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

127.06 127.93 B: um 

127.95 130.36 B: (( [lipsmack] i mean because if you )) 

130.83 137.33 B: have i mean if your values are more socialistic as opposed to [noise] materialistic [noise] 

137.40 141.80 B: then [mn] you're probably going to go [sigh] more [noise] toward [noise] 

142.35 143.30 B: um 

144.33 152.51 B: [noise] i'm sorry [laughter] my kids came in the room [sigh] more towards um [lipsmack] [noise] public service or [noise] something [noise] of that nature 

152.60 155.15 B: as opposed to the business 

155.80 156.67 B: [noise] side of 

158.28 160.49 A: yeah yeah that that could be 

158.79 159.46 B: (( things [noise] )) 

160.36 161.76 B: and um 

162.53 169.97 B: [lipsmack] and not to say it wouldn't work if one was public service and the other was more business [noise] it [sigh] just um 

170.01 174.61 B: [noise] and your values [noise] even if you're business [noise] your values could still 

174.88 175.88 B: be 

175.27 176.55 A: yeah 

176.11 177.82 B: v- v- very good 

177.18 179.92 A: yeah that had they have to be um [sigh] 

179.99 184.68 A: uh particularly if one is uh in more towards the service end uh you know you 

184.83 189.83 A: [sigh] sometimes having one in the service end and one not you know might be good for balance [sigh] 

189.61 190.27 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

189.88 195.14 A: um but but the core core value and belief still has to pretty much be 

195.51 197.10 A: [sigh] you know on track 

197.46 198.80 A: one with the other 

198.91 199.81 B: (( [sigh] right )) 

200.11 207.88 B: [noise] and [mn] being at opposite ends on some things [noise] could help you balance because you can learn from the other 

208.14 211.59 B: [sigh] but being at opposite ends on everything i 

211.67 214.30 B: [sigh] don't think that would work for very long [noise] [laughter] 

213.76 219.97 A: no it uh though it might make it s- you know interesting [laughter] [laughter] 

217.07 218.53 B: (( right [sigh] )) 

219.03 221.49 B: it could make it volatile though [laughter] 

220.65 232.75 A: yeah yeah [laughter] the uh the e- the eruptions would be uh would be colorful to say the least [laughter] oh i don't know i i think other than that um 

228.60 229.38 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

233.47 234.05 A: (( [sigh] )) 

234.77 241.25 A: well uh yeah i guess to have uh uh values and so forth that are the same your you know the backgrounds have to be 

237.06 237.62 B: (( mm )) 

241.29 247.30 A: uh somewhat similar you know same uh economic uh strata same uh [sigh] 

247.54 248.80 A: um 

249.40 253.50 A: you know social background 

252.13 252.89 B: right 

254.22 258.50 A: [sigh] um uh and and even religious you know background can like 

254.29 255.44 B: (( i understand )) 

257.29 263.60 B: right my husband and i are the same religion [sigh] but he was raised military and i was raised civilian 

263.88 265.74 B: and um 

266.18 269.14 B: his father was a colonel in the air force 

269.31 271.25 B: so he had 

271.33 278.93 B: [sigh] you know the stature and everything [laughter] and [sigh] my father owned his own business but it was as a carpenter 

278.69 279.54 A: (( uh-huh )) 

279.46 283.56 B: so he wasn't he didn't have the status 

283.93 285.70 B: and um 

285.91 289.93 B: [lipsmack] but his family had the values that that didn't matter to them 

290.17 291.43 A: yeah 

290.84 294.42 B: and it didn't matter to my husband and 

294.68 295.57 B: um 

296.66 300.04 B: [noise] his parents were both raised on farms 

300.05 307.68 B: you know [sigh] they had to [sigh] grow their own food and everything for a living so [sigh] they still they went back to their 

308.01 310.28 B: primary values 

310.52 311.42 A: (( hm )) 

311.12 312.45 B: and um 

312.48 318.16 B: [sigh] 'cause there are some things some times where it seems that [sigh] money is an issue with them 

319.32 322.73 B: and then there's [sigh] other times that 

319.33 320.28 A: yeah 

322.89 324.86 B: you know they couldn't care less 

325.47 328.04 B: but it seems more when we're 

328.42 330.77 B: with them at their house 

331.11 333.27 B: (( than when we're at other places )) 

333.31 334.96 A: what that it is an issue 

334.66 336.20 B: that money's an issue 

335.98 337.02 A: yeah 

337.03 337.59 A: (( [sigh] )) 

337.11 337.92 B: (( but )) 

339.37 340.97 B: um but 

341.24 344.57 B: like i said when they're visiting us it doesn't seem to be 

344.32 345.71 A: yeah 

345.51 346.28 B: they 

346.38 351.17 B: i think you also need to look at that when you're choosing a mate because 

352.30 356.08 B: you're going to have to deal with that [sigh] you know all your life 

355.65 360.09 A: [sigh] oh yeah [laughter] 

356.84 358.51 B: [laughter] 

359.10 365.91 B: and we've uh we have come to an agreement and have a great balance with that now 

366.24 367.08 B: i mean 

367.12 374.53 B: [mn] i sometimes have to back off and say [sigh] okay [laughter] go ahead [sigh] i just i don't want my kids being overly spoiled 

369.98 371.91 A: [laughter] yeah yeah 

374.74 379.89 B: and um i mean kids need to be spoiled to some [laughter] extent 

379.51 388.95 A: yeah that's uh yeah [sigh] but but on the other hand uh on the hand you don't want them uh like uh act like they were raised in a concentration camp neither [sigh] 

388.59 396.19 B: right well no i've [sigh] i want them to know that they have to work for some things that not everything is going to be handed to them 

389.00 389.94 A: (( um )) 

396.12 399.15 A: [sigh] yeah and and again you're back to the value thing 

398.56 408.56 B: right and that's [laughter] good [sigh] um i think that my husband and his brother were raised with those values [sigh] even though they did get 

409.55 413.88 B: [mn] they got more things because they had the money to 

414.22 415.67 A: yeah 

415.29 422.80 B: and but they still had they still had chores and things whereas they probably did to an extent o- earn it 

423.22 427.48 A: [sigh] yeah like we yeah we [mn] we have a son and he's he's got uh 

427.96 439.48 A: you know chores not you know not a whole lot i don't guess [sigh] not in comparison to what uh you know we had when we were growing up [sigh] [mn] but it's all relative i guess 

431.67 432.71 B: (( right mhm )) 

440.51 442.25 A: um you know 

442.43 448.84 A: and and it's like the old story you had to walk two miles to uh to school up hill both directions you know [laughter] 

445.68 446.45 B: (( right )) 

448.19 449.08 B: well 

450.07 454.90 B: i w- was talking about this with my daughter earlier and 

454.91 459.02 B: they seem to have more stress of school than we did 

459.19 461.23 B: or at least here they do 

461.27 462.63 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

462.52 463.97 B: and um 

464.39 466.95 B: [sigh] there's just more and more added to 

467.07 470.18 B: what they have to learn that than what we did 

470.75 473.31 B: and some of the stuff she's learning now i 

473.33 475.37 B: never saw until college 

475.78 476.59 A: (( [noise] hm )) 

476.37 477.83 B: (( and [laughter] it's like )) 

478.88 484.95 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] uh you know and i've thought that too and but in in different areas um they don't seem 

479.05 479.61 B: (( [mn] )) 

485.66 492.43 A: [sigh] uh nearly as advanced particularly uh they want them more advanced so they push more at them in science and in math [sigh] 

493.37 500.59 A: uh but at the same time you you speak to half of these uh children after high school [sigh] and they cannot communicate 

500.06 501.20 B: right 

500.75 507.61 A: they cannot spell they cannot speak they cannot write and they clearly will not listen you know or cannot listen 

503.73 504.57 B: (( uh well )) 

508.11 509.06 B: (( um )) 

508.29 509.60 A: (( so i don't know )) 

511.08 524.46 B: one of the things that i found very interesting about the school that my nine year old is going to is [sigh] [mn] they are he's going to an academy and a a magnet school [sigh] and um 

522.38 523.44 A: mhm 

525.28 529.32 B: th- they're expressing to them the fine arts 

529.47 536.02 B: which i was like oh my gosh you know [laughter] i wasn't exposed to this until high school 

533.30 534.91 A: mhm 

536.30 537.82 B: and it's just 

538.88 543.15 B: it i think that it's good that they're doing that because i think that 

543.58 546.33 B: gives them respect 

546.54 549.28 B: that they can carry into the world 

549.92 555.04 B: because they can look at things in a different way in an artistic way 

555.32 557.30 B: maybe and um 

557.47 561.16 B: [lipsmack] which is i think that helps set their values also 

562.09 564.87 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] or at least a way of looking at things 

564.28 565.93 B: (( [lipsmack] right it's )) 

565.36 566.27 A: (( um )) 

566.33 569.46 A: as compared with what you know we had uh 

570.21 573.13 A: all of those many years back it was uh 

573.44 574.31 A: (( uh )) 

574.52 585.27 A: you know everything was a basic course you got your diploma and you [sigh] moved on [noise] you know so oh i just dropped the phone [laughter] [noise] [noise] [lipsmack] [sigh] 

583.04 583.78 B: (( [noise] oh [laughter] )) 

586.93 588.73 B: (( um [lipsmack] oh um )) 

590.38 592.77 B: how did you meet your partner were you 

593.35 596.51 B: like uh did you go to school together or 

596.27 599.89 A: uh no uh um um [sigh] i 

597.14 597.49 B: (( [sigh] ))
