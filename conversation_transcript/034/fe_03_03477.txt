16.16 17.50 A: yeah really 

20.99 23.32 A: right right 

22.78 27.70 B: um the first thing i think for me would be um loyalty would be number one i think

28.32 32.05 B: you know just that they stand behind you no matter what 

31.50 35.91 A: exactly and trust you know and that that's all part of the loyalty

50.44 52.29 B: yeah you're linda right 

51.67 52.78 A: right 

52.46 54.36 B: yeah i think um 

54.69 61.19 B: and i i think it's more important than i used to think now that i'm older is having a lot of like shared set of values 

57.21 58.57 A: (( okay mhm )) 

60.80 61.93 A: right 

61.58 64.83 B: especially when it comes to raising children [laughter] 

63.47 67.94 A: yeah well you know i'm i'm past that point right now my kids are all grown 

67.59 70.07 B: oh good [laughter] good i mean 

67.98 69.41 A: you know so 

69.81 80.07 A: yeah so as you get to my point point in life is uh somebody who's gonna stick by you no matter what and whether you get sick or or you know no matter what kind of major changes may happen to you 

79.81 80.71 B: right 

80.17 81.06 A: (( you know )) 

80.86 82.31 B: that's very important 

81.19 84.17 A: and i think that's real important also um 

84.22 89.51 A: like like myself you know my partner's a little bit uh well twelve years younger than me 

89.14 90.29 B: oh wow 

89.46 101.68 A: and i'm really i'm more hesitant about it than he is so that's why i'm asking him questions about you know are you gonna be there for me in the long run 'cause i mean i'm gonna be a lo- you know older than you women change you know 

99.99 102.02 B: right you know 

101.66 104.58 A: more than a man does most of the time 

104.16 105.64 B: physically yeah 

104.78 114.09 A: yeah and are you you know do you understand you know what is necessary you know for a life partner who needs to be there for maybe a partner who is ill 

113.92 114.94 B: i know 

114.61 115.59 A: (( you know )) 

115.62 116.49 B: i guess 

115.67 117.32 A: or anything you know 

116.91 129.39 B: i guess you you know i mean the only good thing in one way is that women do i think in one way um li- you know they well they live longer than men so that's it kinda averages out i think it kinda evens out as you get to a certain age 

124.72 125.85 A: right 

127.10 131.22 A: yes that's why i kinda like the idea of going younger [laughter] you know 

130.43 133.86 B: oh you're definitely right [laughter] 

131.47 135.05 A: yeah so they're there for you when you need 'em [laughter] you know 

133.93 136.97 B: i know for sure [laughter] 

136.04 147.55 A: but i think that is really important too and you know and somebody you can be actually comfortable with that you if even if you're in the same room you don't necessarily have to talk to each other to be comfortable with each other and you know 

138.17 139.24 B: yeah 

146.43 147.75 B: oh for yeah 

147.89 149.93 A: i think that's really important too 

149.61 151.06 B: what about um 

151.46 154.89 B: like real romantic love do you think that's real important 

155.00 156.46 A: i think it is 

156.60 163.57 A: if if if it's good it's not as important it's i think if it's not good i think that then it is important 

162.98 166.42 B: yeah you're right yeah [laughter] exactly yeah 

163.78 175.82 A: you know you know what i mean i mean i think you really have to be compatible that way too you can't have one who is really you know has a higher li- libido than you do either 'cause that causes problems [laughter] you know 

172.92 173.88 B: right 

174.56 177.92 B: yeah no exactly but i mean you know how like [cough] 

177.97 185.25 B: you know when you're first with someone you have that like um honey- you know it's not a honeymoon but you know just real infatuation head over heels kind of feeling and um 

182.23 183.50 A: right 

183.53 187.86 A: right then you start to cal- calm down and get content with each other you 

187.26 191.79 B: yeah and you you know it's real you know i know my mom used to always say that um 

188.04 188.83 A: (( know )) 

191.85 198.56 B: you know even though that's important that you want someone that's gonna be your best friend more than anything you know someone you can talk to 

196.26 201.39 A: exactly somebody you can you can trust with your li- with your innermost feelings 

201.21 203.23 B: exactly yeah 

201.75 206.56 A: you know that you know they're not gonna treat it you know like it's nothing you know it has to be important 

204.93 210.24 B: and throw it up yeah and throw it up in your face later something like really that you told him [laughter] 

207.66 216.69 A: right and somebody yeah and you need somebody you can argue with who's not gonna hate you for that argument that you're actually gonna solve problems with it you know 

211.63 212.60 B: right 

213.42 214.34 B: right 

215.71 217.95 B: i know you're right 

217.06 220.44 A: make it into a discussion more than an argument [laughter] 

220.18 230.58 B: yeah and i think um someone i mean i don't know how i guess it is important i guess the things change so much from when i was in my twenties and i i was married you know and then now with the person i'm with now 

230.32 231.49 A: right 

230.89 232.75 B: (( you know i think i was um )) 

232.27 235.36 A: i think your goals change y- you know as as your age 

233.43 238.79 B: yeah i guess that's part of it too and i just wasn't you know i didn't realize how important you know just 

238.48 239.69 A: you don't 

239.06 249.08 B: you know how important some of the things are like that you know their values are the s- you know i i guess it comes up a lot well it comes up a lot even when you don't have children you know my kids are pretty much grown too but 

246.74 247.72 A: right 

248.69 255.61 A: or i mean for animals too you know if you to somebody who doesn't care about animals you're gonna have a hard time there [laughter] 

250.15 251.09 B: yeah 

253.66 257.40 B: oh yeah really [laughter] if you're like me you will [laughter] 

255.99 259.08 A: yeah 'cause i'm into animals and stuff [laughter] you know so 

258.74 259.87 B: yeah 

259.12 269.70 A: i need somebody who can you know at least likes animals and you know doesn't say well no you can't have any or you know they can't be around me or whatever you can't do that either you have to have you have to have common goals actually 

264.89 265.88 B: right 

269.18 270.14 B: right 

270.16 270.96 B: you think 

270.27 272.64 A: but you know when you're younger you don't think of that 

272.33 276.88 B: i guess that it's according to how imp- yeah you're right and how it's according to how important your religion is to you 

276.75 277.70 A: right 

277.23 280.78 B: whether that's a major thing or not too you know 

278.93 280.91 A: that's true very true 

281.08 292.10 B: yeah i don't think i would want i don't think i could be married to for me someone that was an atheist you know i i i couldn't you know my sister is well he's agnostic or something and i'd i would it would drive me crazy 

284.87 286.42 A: no i couldn't either 

287.53 288.25 A: (( no )) 

290.14 291.08 A: yeah 

291.59 296.96 A: i couldn't do that either because i would always be offended [laughter] you know 

294.27 296.74 B: yeah i would too [laughter] like uh 

296.77 300.44 B: 'cause that's you know it's it's an important part of my life and i you know 

299.94 305.17 A: yeah see well the the man i'm gonna marry he does believe in god but he's really like 

305.30 309.34 A: he don't really talk about it or nothing like that and i wanna talk about it you know and he just 

309.27 321.80 A: doesn't feel like it so i mean i mean but it says you know the the woman's faith sanctifies the husband all right but i'm gonna do a lot of talking to him about it [laughter] you know 

309.37 310.36 B: yeah 

317.79 318.71 B: yeah 

321.14 322.28 B: yeah 

321.71 328.16 A: so i mean al- although that is important i think it's something even you know god can eventually bring them around too 

327.52 336.89 B: oh i think so too you know that was true of my first marriage you know because he had the basic belief i guess that's as long as they aren't against it um then you 

328.52 329.45 A: (( you know )) 

330.24 331.48 A: yeah 

334.06 335.07 A: right 

335.13 336.08 A: right 

336.27 339.94 A: or devil worshippers [laughter] 

337.33 341.64 B: yeah somebody oh god i can't imagine that would be horrible [laughter] i know 

340.43 342.86 A: (( [laughter] )) 

341.80 351.19 B: yeah that that would be that would just be going a little too far the other way yeah no but as long as they have some basic you know belief in that there's a god and that there's you know 

344.96 347.03 A: (( yes yeah so i mean you know )) 

351.21 354.11 B: something valuable in it you know it 

352.66 361.27 A: right as long as you can come together on most of the things that you believe in or most of your goals you know yeah there has to be differences or you'd be bored out of your mind 

357.25 358.11 B: right 

360.38 365.20 B: oh i know you have to have some differences and sense of humor's very important to me too 

362.17 363.52 A: yeah 

364.72 365.63 A: yes 

365.39 366.97 B: you know um 

366.10 370.07 A: oh yeah around me you gotta have a sense of humor [laughter] you know 

368.20 378.90 B: yeah i i don't mean i don't want someone that's like a joke you know that's always like you know what is it like a comedian or anything but i just mean someone that has like the same twisted sense of humor [laughter] i 

372.24 374.53 A: pranks and stuff yeah 

377.46 381.61 A: yeah true and they can laugh at themselves you know and not just everybody else 

379.40 384.52 B: do yeah that you don't take yourself so seriously right you know they sorta seem to you know 

382.02 382.96 A: right 

384.37 385.29 A: right 

384.71 385.76 B: and uh 

385.95 390.09 B: you know some people they seem like you know they get too self important and they you know they 

390.48 391.68 B: they can't 

391.88 392.78 B: um 

392.90 400.93 B: what about let's see what else was i thinking about it's weird i guess my requirements are so different now financial they have i mean 

400.90 411.11 B: didn't matter to me at all when i was younger and it doesn't matter if they have a lot of money to me now but they have to have some i mean stability right i don't want someone that just like came out you know out of uh 

404.57 405.80 A: right 

406.67 409.18 A: they have to be stable you know 

410.19 412.73 A: or can't keep a job or anything like that 

411.38 415.60 B: yeah like an alcohol detox and they can't keep a job and [laughter] you know 

414.24 420.47 A: right that's true but that you know that's true from you know from the time you get married till you know to the end of your married life you know 

419.67 420.57 B: right 

420.31 430.32 A: that should be something that's you know important and also what are their goals eh with finances uh th- that they wanna have like a million dollar home cars and jewelry and all that stuff or 

430.01 431.03 B: right 

430.15 435.37 A: are they content to be you know nice home you know that's kept clean and all that you know and that's another thing 

433.92 441.92 B: exac- oh that's that's very important yeah that could make actually money can be one of the bigger things and that can really people fight about you know

471.11 479.94 B: it is it yeah 'cause it does and if it doesn't bother them it's like well you know [sigh] yeah that that can be a real major thing and and also like you've said about um
