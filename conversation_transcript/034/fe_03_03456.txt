97.05 100.41 A: so um like love for the m-

104.88 105.82 B: mhm 

105.33 106.42 A: but um 

107.13 121.58 A: within that time frame i became saved and changed my life around and accepted the lord and i have recently found someone that is not a man through church 'cause i tell ya there are no good men at church they're all um married 

111.84 113.04 B: mhm 

121.53 124.72 B: oh yeah that's true i've found that to be true 

122.88 123.94 A: (( [laughter] )) 

124.60 133.20 A: but um i did meet a man and and brought him to my church and he ended up getting saved and it's just made us a lot closer 

130.80 132.11 B: mhm 

133.14 134.11 B: yeah 

133.31 138.87 A: he's everything you described um dependable faithful interested in me 

138.91 141.13 A: but in a way i find that 

141.18 145.60 A: this makes me sound like a jerk probably but i kinda find it boring 

145.58 146.65 B: really 

146.14 150.27 A: i get bored in a situation that is too comfortable 

150.65 156.94 A: i mean if everything is so peachy comfortable i don't know i end up doing something to stir things up 

156.82 158.37 B: really hm 

157.78 166.40 A: and not that i wouldn't want a a perfect relationship because i don't know i think in a big way i'm not sure i believe in it any more but 

166.37 169.68 B: how what would you do to stir it up i mean what is something 

169.60 172.58 A: well i'm thinking of my ex 

169.75 170.67 B: (( like that )) 

172.78 174.09 A: he um 

174.17 184.79 A: he was very boring very dull never liked to do anything and wouldn't let me out to do anything so if i ever i wasn't allowed to work while our children were young and 

175.86 177.31 B: mhm 

185.00 188.13 A: [sigh] it was just tough never having any kind of life of my own 

188.11 189.02 B: right 

188.39 191.08 A: once in a while i i used to live in austin 

191.26 196.90 A: and i'd get out with my friends and i wouldn't come home all night just to make him mad 

196.84 197.79 B: right 

197.45 205.87 A: and that was way before i found the lord and he is um just he he doesn't believe in god 

206.27 207.42 B: mhm 

207.25 217.31 A: and that um you know i have always believed but i never have been this close but that always has made a kind of a argument between us that would never go away 

217.12 227.35 B: yeah i yeah [sigh] well i i mean it's interesting that you said that um it's boring because it's like in my situations i've always had the 

227.79 229.85 B: the i guess um 

230.18 236.01 B: the interesting situation of where someone's not doing what i just said you know what i mean 

235.07 236.75 A: yeah yeah 

235.87 248.23 B: and so it's n- i mean it's like that's what i want now but it's interesting for you to say that it's boring when it's like that because i've always had the drama you know i've always had 

243.41 244.18 A: [laughter] 

246.59 248.46 A: oh i see 

248.21 253.11 B: yeah i've always had the something one of those elements weren't 

253.88 258.76 B: what i was getting you know and so it's like now that's what i want but 

254.94 256.29 A: i see 

258.78 262.92 B: you know for you to bring up the point that it might be boring to me 

262.66 265.25 A: (( well maybe not to you but [mn] )) 

263.37 264.16 B: then 

264.43 266.70 B: no but i'm just saying because i mean 

266.60 279.59 B: that that is interesting because a lot of me and my girlfriends we always like oh we don't wanna be with him he's boring and so for you to bring that point up after me bringing up those things that's kinda like scary [laughter] 

272.13 273.34 A: mhm 

277.34 289.70 A: [laughter] i think though a lot of times the boring men are probably the ones that will make good life partners they're more stable and maybe you know we could make it more 

285.07 286.09 B: right 

289.87 293.57 A: exciting or interesting or a little bit of drama you know 

293.34 294.43 B: yeah 

293.78 301.79 A: 'cause i'm not a drama queen my sister is but so i can see on that end how how outrageous it can get but 

297.16 298.38 B: mhm 

301.14 302.00 B: right 

301.82 306.40 A: you know one thing i learned recently too is i'm never gonna get it all 

306.34 307.32 B: mhm 

306.67 308.79 A: and i don't have to settle 

308.83 315.32 A: you know for way lower or way below my i i don't mean to say below my standards but 

314.40 315.39 B: right 

315.31 325.08 A: something completely out there that wouldn't go along with my own beliefs i don't have to settle for way out there but i'm never gonna get it all 

319.57 320.83 B: mhm 

324.97 325.99 B: yeah 

325.34 329.00 A: and i like i have a boyfriend now and he isn't good looking 

328.92 329.94 B: mhm 

329.22 336.44 A: and he's overweight and those are two things i've always you know i've always been after the hot guy you know with the nice butt 

330.85 331.78 B: mhm 

336.26 337.20 B: right 

337.21 345.34 A: and i can see past these things for the first time in my life into him and he's a wonderful person hardworking dependable 

345.51 351.60 A: but um he does have a little bit of an exciting edge he drives a harley and we get to ride and 

350.03 352.29 B: oh yeah oh yeah that's cool 

351.97 353.45 A: that part's fun 

353.72 357.51 A: but he's he's not my um you know picture perfect man 

353.99 354.73 B: (( what )) 

356.38 358.81 B: dream yeah your dream person 

357.95 364.93 A: but but he sure treats me like a you know he puts me on my pedestal and cherishes me which is wow 

364.55 368.61 B: yeah that's important i think i mean really important 

367.84 374.38 A: and like you said somebody that's interested in you and sitting there and listening to what you say actually listening not just pretending 

374.83 376.17 B: yeah 

374.86 377.52 A: to listen you know how men do that 

377.34 380.87 B: right and i think it's you know with um 

377.55 378.30 A: (( [laughter] )) 

381.33 387.14 B: you know like you say you're not gonna get everything that you want but i think it's important that 

384.31 385.39 A: exactly 

387.36 396.12 B: you know i've not you know the guy you know my mom's like you need to find a man that's a christian or whatever that's fine but i don't he doesn't necessarily have to be 

396.32 398.43 B: deep in the church now 

396.51 397.63 A: right 

397.96 398.92 A: right 

398.56 402.87 B: but i do want him to at least be- you know believe 

402.05 403.74 A: exactly 'cause 

402.89 414.57 B: because i mean when things get rough or say that we're married and you know we're having a tough time i mean we're not gonna be able to always map it out but i think if we go to a higher being 

414.58 420.92 B: you know we pray or something that you know it'll work out and so i'm not saying i want a guy who's just like 

416.66 418.30 A: exactly 

420.83 435.59 B: a minister or a deacon or anything like that because i really don't but i do want someone who is spiritual to where they do believe and they do have a background of where you know either their parents took 'em to church or they know where to go when 

422.09 423.56 A: right 

434.77 436.22 A: yeah they know 

435.41 444.60 B: things happen you know and they know that they can't always do it themselves and that's what we need to do is go to church and pray or whatever so 

443.80 450.84 A: um that is no you know everything happens for a reason and you and i got on the phone and we connected today and um 

451.11 457.73 A: now we're talking spiritually and it's i know that's why uh we you and i connected i think i i know that 

457.42 458.52 B: mhm 

458.05 466.63 A: um and like say you did find him and he wasn't a churchgoer but he had a christian upbringing but he hadn't been saved 

466.53 467.40 B: right 

466.94 470.53 A: if you were to go to church on sundays or wednesday nights or whenever 

470.42 471.32 B: mhm 

470.65 473.58 A: he'll eventually follow you to church you know 

472.91 474.32 B: yeah 

473.68 484.53 A: and he'll eventually feel the spirit too i mean enough praying for him there's no way out i'm sorry there's no way out [laughter] because it's you know it's waiting for us all 

480.74 482.23 B: right 

484.52 491.53 B: right but i mean if you if you meet someone and then they're like uh i don't go to church i don't believe in the lord i mean that's one thing that 

491.29 497.43 B: you know even though he might be the most handsome thing but that kinda turns me off because if you're just so 

493.05 493.84 A: (( [noise] )) 

497.20 509.13 B: against it you know you're gonna continue to fight that but i mean if a guy was like well you know keisha i don't go to church every sunday but you know i do believe in the lord i mean anything's possible if you believe you know 

500.16 501.30 A: (( yeah )) 

508.13 509.46 A: exactly 

509.16 516.58 B: so i mean it's i think it's kinda open but my mom's always like well you need to find a guy no i really don't wanna find a guy who's like 

516.87 519.96 B: in there in there in there you know [sigh] 

518.47 528.70 A: yeah and i tell ya every time i well not i don't go to church looking for a man but i have looked around my church or the last church and they're all married 

525.66 526.74 B: mhm 

528.16 529.38 B: yeah 

528.75 532.90 A: they're all married and they're christian men there with their christian families and 

532.96 536.73 A: you know i'm not rattling any of them bones [laughter] 

535.74 540.24 B: yeah and then like when i'm at church i really don't even feel comfortable 

540.41 549.06 B: you know doing that i mean that's just me personally i mean guys come up to me and like speak or whatever but i really don't feel comfortable like 

542.00 543.26 A: mhm 

548.33 551.65 A: geeking around and yeah [laughter] 

549.59 555.22 B: yeah i mean i'm at church and so i'm like more focused in then 

555.29 558.72 B: on what i'm there for or whatever but i mean i don't know 

556.55 557.74 A: exactly 

557.59 563.22 A: but there's so much love in church there's i mean everyone loves me and i love everyone and 

563.05 573.15 A: you know married not married it isn't about m- men and women together at that point it's just the love and and a future man for you will feel the love too 

568.78 570.15 B: right 

573.20 574.17 A: you know 

574.02 575.99 B: (( i hope so you know )) 

575.09 578.64 A: [laughter] oh you're young you got plenty of time 

578.72 583.72 B: well my clock is ticking i'm twenty eight and i want kids soon so 

583.66 589.26 A: that's cool though you're twenty eight and don't have kids yet that is really cool i hope you're in a good job where you're happy
