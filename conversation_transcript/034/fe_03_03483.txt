1.09 2.53 A: (( hello )) 

2.95 4.04 B: hi 

4.55 7.40 A: this my name's tom newman 

7.42 10.95 A: and i'm here in uh port louisiana 

10.37 11.14 B: okay 

13.08 17.63 B: i'm supposed to be talking to you about what the most important thing for a life partner is 

16.99 18.19 A: (( yes )) 

18.46 21.78 B: uh my name is matt and i'm from uh madison wisconsin 

21.92 22.99 A: okay 

24.29 26.56 A: well uh [sigh] 

27.38 34.13 A: the most important things about a life partner as far as i'm concerned is um 

35.73 41.08 A: i guess you could say honesty integrity and a commitment 

41.60 53.86 B: i'd have to agree with you there i think honesty and integrity and commitment are both really good things i'd have to have to say compatibility i think there's people outside of the age group out of my age group that would definitely 

53.95 60.72 B: those three qualities but um if they're significantly older or significantly younger than me i don't think that's 

61.44 64.33 B: um i don't know something i'd look for 

65.25 72.16 A: yeah com- compatibility i i hadn't given that much thought um of course i've been married for 

72.21 73.37 A: um 

73.84 76.68 A: eleven years this june 

76.95 78.53 A: so um 

79.28 83.40 A: i haven't been married as long as some people have but um 

85.04 86.39 A: if you're 

86.81 96.07 A: you've got similar interests similar similar religious beliefs similar um even a similar financial 

96.82 102.35 A: basis uh it works so much better than if you're uh 

102.38 111.16 A: real rich marrying somebody real poor or a catholic marrying a protestant or even atheist marrying a religious person 

111.77 116.74 B: i'd definitely with you there i think a lot of those issues are the same i mean for anyone 

116.99 120.59 B: although i i think some can be be resolved it's definitely uh um 

120.72 123.72 B: easier when both of you are born in similar um 

124.32 128.88 B: (( i don't know what socioeconomic and religious background )) 

129.20 134.54 B: i mean it depends how much people are willing to compromise but it's definitely easier 

134.48 137.68 A: yeah um my experience 

137.67 141.18 A: over the last even twenty years for that matter 

141.13 154.41 A: uh i come from kind of a middle income bracket as far as the way i was raised but for the last twenty years it's been just a positive nightmare for me as far as trying to make a living 

154.47 168.90 A: and um i'll say this that uh it seems like most people here here in the deep south especially unless you've been raised down here they really don't want to give you much of a chance 

168.85 174.60 A: so um i i can see that if you're 

174.78 175.64 A: wor- 

175.70 184.98 A: as far as even a life partner is concerned if you've got the similar socioeconomic ba- a similar socioeconomic basis 

185.05 186.70 A: then um 

187.09 196.12 A: people are more understanding about the struggles if you're in the lower income bracket or uh even 

196.01 203.63 A: more familiar with the struggles of the upper income bracket and so forth and so on so 

203.67 205.96 A: uh i think that uh 

206.48 213.46 A: like you said the compatibility issue they're uh it kinda goes on a variety of topics there 

214.22 223.50 B: i definitely agree with that i'm talking from uh madison wisconsin so i mean we're pretty far north and this this city itself is supposed to be one of the most um 

223.72 229.90 B: liberal so i mean there's quite a mix of people here but i still see even in this mix of um 

230.75 237.24 B: you know different uh classes and different uh uh economic levels you'd definitely um 

237.61 246.42 B: uh people pair off according to um uh you know similar similar backgrounds and those types of things 

245.47 249.37 A: right of course up in madison there's a lot of uh 

249.40 252.95 A: it's it's h- heavily industrialized too isn't it 

253.13 266.68 B: um the surrounding area is um like milwaukee is definitely industrialized and madison itself has lots of different industries but um yeah yeah i would say it's pretty well developed [noise] 

269.67 271.90 B: but 

272.19 274.38 A: so i guess the um 

274.62 275.82 A: uh 

275.84 289.00 A: really uh a life partner kinda transcends even your um socioeconomic [laughter] barriers so to speak i mean back in back in the old world and the um 

289.44 297.77 A: in uh europe you've got people arranging marriages but over here uh it seems like even when you're arranging your own 

297.63 305.60 A: uh you tend to drift toward a certain type of person rather than trying to go to the opposite extreme 

305.72 310.63 B: yeah that certainly certainly is the case i mean there's no caste system here but i mean 

311.08 322.27 B: natural uh divisions just exist and people tend to gravitate towards people of similar backgrounds i mean if you're not i mean even just in terms of meeting someone if you don't 

322.69 327.44 B: have uh a similar background how would you know how would you go about meeting someone 

327.51 328.40 B: you know 

328.71 333.31 B: either far far above you or far below you in terms of wealth 

333.52 336.56 B: (( it's kinda i mean i don't know [laughter] )) 

336.87 344.15 B: if you have don't even have that opportunity to begin with it's hard to say like you could be compatible one way or another if you don't even have a chance to meet 

343.72 345.55 A: (( mhm and )) 

345.99 352.52 A: most people they'll they'll ever meet in bars or different country clubs or at church or whatever 

352.39 361.02 A: and it's just that the same kinda people that they're around for their entire lives that they tend to gravitate towards so 

361.67 363.30 B: that's definitely the case 

363.83 371.54 B: i mean there's different times in your life too like for instance i'm in i'm in college right now and there's a wide range of people here i mean there's people that are 

372.09 379.26 B: um you know you walk down the street and people have expensive s._u._v.s parked in front of their houses and then other people um 

380.00 380.89 B: (( you know i )) 

381.00 395.00 B: know people that you know work working working personally i'm kinda the same way but i mean it seems to afford more of a range of people just because everyone's going to school but not everyone's from the same background either 

395.56 397.81 B: i mean it really depends what you're doing too 

398.02 398.96 A: mhm 

399.43 405.31 A: uh i i remember my college days probably not as well as you do since you're in it but uh 

405.36 409.70 A: y- you're right it seems like there's a more diverse um 

409.48 424.17 A: crowd when when you get into college because in your public school system even in your um ev- even in your private school system everybody's encouraging you to go to college 

413.71 415.60 B: (( mhm )) 

424.35 435.70 A: so that you've got uh as diverse um a selection of people going to college as you have in the public school system 

435.73 445.65 A: so you've got in- instead of everybody just going after the same things though you've got people getting their majors and this that and the other 

445.74 455.87 A: so uh you've got your engineers that are going to the same classes and you've got your accountants that are going to the same classes 

455.90 467.46 A: and once you get past just your basic courses then you're kinda limiting yourself to a certain group of people 

468.65 473.68 B: that's definitely true and i think the i think the one thing that um college is everyone 

473.99 478.55 B: i mean you know everyone there is aspiring to at least a higher education if not you know 

479.02 480.29 B: um 

480.44 484.46 B: a certain career career paths and things like that so when you do get past 

484.57 493.45 B: you know your freshman and sophomore year you you definitely tend to all into certain groups as far as the people you're talking to every day in in class and you know the basic 

493.60 496.06 B: different organizations and stuff you hang out in 

496.83 507.00 B: i mean campus campus life too affords you the opportunity to go and meet people that are across everything else as well other other major and [mn] different groups of people 

506.77 508.61 A: right 

508.87 510.10 A: that's true 

510.62 515.94 A: but even then uh the your interests uh 

516.76 523.88 A: they tend i think they tend to kinda vary from uh for example uh 

524.08 532.07 A: let's say you've got um somebody from the projects here in the deep south that thinks that they want to be a doctor 

532.27 540.62 A: uh they wind up getting into college and discovering hey look this this is harder than it was when 

540.60 555.32 A: uh in in the public school system and i don't think i can i'm really cut out for this i'm not made up made up for this and they wind up dropping out and going to work at wal-mart or mcdonalds or whatever 

555.32 564.40 A: and like that that is in the college crowd they'll go out there and they tend to stay in their little close you know economic 

564.44 571.36 A: uh level even though they may have aspirations to do something far greater so 

572.49 579.11 B: yeah it's i can see that too people tend to pair off and one of the one of the other other things i look for too is um 

579.63 592.99 B: in terms of distance i mean there's a lotta different people here from around the country but i think i would have a difficult time maintaining a relationship over you know a great a great distance i'm i'm graduating soon so i mean 

593.23 599.89 B: the person i'm going to go out with is gonna be uh you know living you know maybe the far west coast or the far east coast or
