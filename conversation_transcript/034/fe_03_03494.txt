29.75 39.37 A: no no no you didn't wake me up i'm the one that called in and then they set me up i guess i called the one eight six six number i don't know it's the first time i've done this have you done this before 

33.93 35.29 B: oh good 

36.72 40.14 B: yeah so we must have called at the same time eh 

40.27 44.19 B: [sigh] so um the topic is life partners right 

43.50 44.59 A: yes 

44.64 50.35 B: um and one of the questions was m- what's the most important thing to look in a life partner 

49.35 50.44 A: right 

50.87 54.09 B: (( um what do you think about that )) 

53.19 61.33 A: um i think someone that shares you know a lot of your same interests as well as maybe some other interests that you know can 

61.74 69.47 A: you can also get involved in to give you know you start participating in other things that you normally wouldn't do kind of a combination of things 

67.24 74.47 B: mhm yes i totally agree i am married and i've been married for ten years 

73.56 74.56 A: uh-huh 

74.45 80.73 B: [sigh] so i think uh basically what i saw on uh my husband was just um 

80.69 82.58 B: similar interests right 

82.47 86.20 B: and uh just basically um 

85.97 98.14 B: [lipsmack] the possibility to share a life with somebody just you know kind of uh picture yourself with that person and see if um 'cause you can't ever agree a hundred percent right 

89.91 90.86 A: right 

97.27 101.42 A: no no but you don't want someone that always just agrees either [laughter] i think 

100.77 112.82 B: no of course not yeah so you have to kind of find a balance and just think you know is is this maybe uh eighty percent or ninety percent of the time that we are on the same channel kind of thing 

112.46 113.50 A: right 

113.15 121.01 B: and then um um just um uh i guess the basic um [lipsmack] values that you share 

120.35 122.88 A: right that's that's very important i 

122.32 124.52 B: right and and um 

124.58 132.56 B: i don't know in my case also i 'cause i'm from mexico so it was also a little bit about religion i think if you have 

130.95 136.43 A: right right that's the first thing that came to mind when you said about sharing the values i thought about religion 

135.07 144.77 B: right yeah because um it it's just um there's a lot of issues when it comes to sharing a life and then having kids and 

140.67 141.53 A: right 

144.74 149.63 A: well that's when the difficulty comes in if you're not on the same wavelength with 

148.94 156.34 B: yes exactly if you're not on the same channel then then there's problems and then you basically live distant lives 

155.97 157.09 A: right 

156.50 161.33 B: i think so um yeah i think you know that's probably one of the 

161.36 174.64 B: the most important things and if you have or um you know not that i'm a you know like very very religious but it's just um in general you know 'cause uh there's some other religions where 

169.23 170.22 A: mhm 

174.63 184.28 B: um you know the the women might be considered second you know place and that kind of thing is just a general um 

180.16 181.65 A: right right 

183.21 185.87 A: so your husband and you share the similar 

185.53 192.23 B: yeah yeah he was uh he was canadian and he was just um raised uh his parents were italian 

192.04 193.00 A: uh-huh 

193.09 200.44 B: so it was just the same idea same catholic um you know traditions and stuff so 

198.00 199.00 A: right 

200.60 209.66 B: um yeah i think that's basically and also in my case it was um [lipsmack] we had the same kind of background in education 

209.50 210.48 A: (( uh-huh )) 

210.19 223.57 B: so that was also important i think because we we spoke the same language kind of thing you know and we understood each other in that sense and just in general [sigh] you know if you meet somebody then uh if they're 

214.88 216.45 A: right right 

223.52 226.18 B: say for instance they don't wanna have children 

225.89 227.00 A: right 

226.31 229.61 B: you know for me that was really important 

228.54 234.50 A: i know i see that sometimes on these shows that they [laughter] they don't talk about that beforehand and it's a big problem 

232.85 234.16 B: i know 

234.15 242.37 B: and then it's like you know three months into the relationship or you know a year into the relationship or when they're thinking about marrying and then um 

242.32 249.87 B: then that comes up and it's really a big decision i think you know and 

244.08 244.98 A: right 

247.81 251.44 A: yeah i know yeah you're only kidding yourself if you you know 

251.57 256.13 A: if you think it's gonna change later on if you're the one that wants children and the other person doesn't 

255.74 261.62 B: exactly and then another another thing is when you think that you're gonna change that person 

261.55 262.52 A: (( no [laughter] )) 

262.06 266.60 B: then that [laughter] that doesn't work either right 

265.77 271.87 A: no not at all 'cause there's still those things that i thought oh maybe that'll change it's still the same but it's not 

266.94 269.36 B: so you have to be just 

271.90 273.03 A: it's not 

273.38 275.64 A: that you know it's not things that 

275.91 278.93 A: [noise] hasn't really changed anything you know what i mean 

278.08 288.66 B: no no and also get to know the person uh well before you know you make a decision of commitment and stuff because uh you're basically stuck right 

285.63 286.42 A: right 

288.27 289.32 A: right 

288.97 292.38 B: and for the sake of the kids and everything so i 

291.00 295.85 A: [noise] hold on i'm on the phone my child is we just had a thunderstorm and he's [laughter] 

295.02 299.46 B: oh really yeah i can hear i can hear a little one in the background there 

298.69 300.18 A: (( yeah )) 

299.54 302.13 B: so you have some one children one child 

301.20 303.67 A: i have two children yeah 

302.28 303.15 B: two 

302.97 315.59 B: oh i have three girls [laughter] so yeah that's that's definitely important you know then then if you talk about values and then how you want to raise your kids and all that stuff and [sigh] um 

304.31 305.94 A: (( oh that's great )) 

312.49 313.47 A: right 

315.43 321.98 B: you know for me it was difficult because we moved i moved from mexico to canada and i left everybody behind 

321.78 324.47 A: oh so you don't have any of your family there 

323.77 324.93 B: no 

325.09 326.19 B: [lipsmack] so it was 

325.23 329.47 A: so are you close to that to family was important to you mm 

328.90 336.59 B: yes it was but i i mean it is right but it it's just that i thought if i'm gonna share the rest of my life with him 

336.66 345.46 B: then i have to um consider what uh will be best in the in the long run you know not just think about myself and be with my 

342.41 343.34 A: right 

345.64 354.36 B: my family and everything if i'm gonna be spending the majority of my life with him you know if you spend twenty years with your parents or eighteen 

351.11 352.08 A: right 

354.41 365.55 B: then you're gonna spend maybe you know sixty years hopefully with your partner right so you have to kind of also think of what will be the the best for the whole family 

358.12 359.08 A: (( right mm )) 

365.71 369.92 B: [lipsmack] so yeah i think i think um you know hopefully we'll 

370.15 380.65 B: be able to talk about this with our kids [laughter] and hopefully you know they'll they'll make a good decision that which ultimately will be their decision right 

372.78 374.39 A: [laughter] 

380.41 381.80 A: (( right i'm )) 

381.17 383.25 B: so yeah 

382.50 385.07 A: trying to think of what other things i look you know 

385.16 386.09 B: pardon 

385.70 388.74 A: i think we've covered most of the main the main points 

388.40 395.62 B: yeah i know that being um um you know o- open basically open and um honest 

394.87 397.55 A: i was just gonna say honesty is a big thing 

397.23 401.99 B: right just to kind of be up front and just lay lay it out and 

402.11 409.12 B: um you know try to um express all your concerns and make sure you have all your questions answered 

409.40 417.07 B: and um you know that's just that that will be a good start and and see what happens 

417.00 418.01 A: right 

418.32 428.62 B: [sigh] so let's see yeah i think um it's a tough decision you know if you've basically if you don't think about it then it can really affect your life 

428.04 439.29 A: right well i think a lot of times too i mean if you have when you're making that decision of who's gonna be your life partner if you have any kinda doubt in your mind then usually that's kinda like telling you something [laughter] 

428.80 429.36 B: (( [mn] )) 

438.89 443.33 B: yeah it's a good it's a good uh idea to follow your instincts right 

442.55 443.57 A: right 

443.38 453.14 B: so yeah but then again if you take um an a decision and just follow on that on on a hunch or something then it might not be the right one either 

452.53 453.62 A: right 

453.59 461.33 B: so yeah no but cer- certainly uh a feeling of um if you're not comfortable with the person or something there must be something wrong 

461.53 462.41 B: right 

462.02 462.99 A: right 

462.81 471.05 B: so yeah no that's um you have to sometimes you have to take your chances also you kind of have to grab the opportunity 

469.42 470.42 A: right 

471.06 483.96 B: um and just go for it you know but um it's it's getting hard i think uh you know right now i see a lot of people 'specially in north america getting married at a later age 

483.45 485.67 A: right that's very true 

485.27 492.54 B: and then uh i guess that's good in a sense but it also gives you too much time to think about it [laughter] and then you get so picky 

490.82 501.81 A: yeah [laughter] well you also get used to your own lifestyle and then that i think that causes problems because then when you do get married it's kinda hard to accustom 'cause you had a long long time 

493.71 495.17 B: exactly 

501.50 502.66 B: yes 

501.82 503.11 A: it's kinda like when 

503.19 514.13 A: before when you went from your parents right into a relationship really you were still like not being controlled but you know what i mean you didn't have your total freedom but now when you're out of the house for so long and then 

509.13 510.78 B: yeah you're just starting 

513.74 516.44 B: independent and 

514.60 522.62 A: independent and you have your own place and you do what you want when you want then it makes it a little bit more difficult 

519.67 521.43 B: (( yeah )) 

521.80 530.61 B: exactly exactly so that's also something that um you know it's it's difficult to know when the right time is you know for everybody 

529.47 530.39 A: right 

530.62 544.68 B: some people say they wanna wait until they're fi- you know they have some career established and just have fun and you know go out there and and see the world but then again when is the right time for you 

538.51 539.53 A: right 

543.69 547.32 A: right and then don't you wanna be young enough to enjoy your kids so 

546.41 552.20 B: exactly that's exactly what i was gonna say because then you know you you're forty and they're five 

552.28 563.99 B: or you know or or or or something like it's just not enough time left and then when do you gonna be able to enjoy when they graduate and your grandkids and 

553.20 553.98 A: yeah 

562.67 568.62 A: exactly i mean i think there's gonna be a decrease in the amount of people that are gonna be able to enjoy their grandkids 

567.99 573.84 B: their grandkids right or be healthy enough to to be um around them and everything so 

573.84 588.35 B: yeah in in mexico there's a lo- um it's i like i was married when i was twenty three and i was basically an old maid [laughter] i was too old i know it's super young right right now but my sister was married she got married when she was eighteen 

581.32 583.58 A: mm that's young to me 

588.03 589.16 A: oh 

588.77 595.82 B: so in in our family's standards me getting married at twenty three i was already old you know 

594.96 596.58 A: wow right 

596.19 599.92 B: so it is it is different in in different cultures and you know
