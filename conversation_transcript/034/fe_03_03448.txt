71.81 73.21 A: okay well good 

72.41 77.75 B: i i think that when i when i'm looking for someone a lifetime partner 

77.83 80.74 B: i think i'm looking for someone 

80.79 83.64 B: who is stable one 

83.65 87.85 B: because i've had several men in the past who can talk a good talk 

87.70 88.54 A: (( uh-huh )) 

87.88 99.61 B: and walk a good walk but when it comes down to getting a job done [lipsmack] they're no good so they have to be stable [lipsmack] and they have to be strong minded because i've had men in the past who 

92.94 93.82 A: yeah 

99.54 103.71 B: when the going gets tough they get going [laughter] 

103.33 104.49 A: mhm 

103.91 114.27 B: so and i've had two children by two different men [lipsmack] so i'm basically looking for someone who interacts with children very well and you know 

114.30 124.82 B: i don't want anybody to think that you know because these aren't my kids or my children i'm gonna treat them differently [lipsmack] so that's definitely something i look for 

124.73 125.90 A: (( mm yeah )) 

125.07 130.55 B: as well as someone who's passionate i'm a passionate person 

130.41 131.04 A: (( uh )) 

130.56 144.01 B: so i really like you know flowers and show up at my job with 'em and candies and things like that [lipsmack] so i look for stuff like that and let's see what else do i look for [lipsmack] uh a thinker 

144.11 146.65 B: because a think- a man who thinks 

146.76 158.51 B: is a man who will get you very very far who will sit down and plan out if this is gonna be this then we need to do this to get here you see what i'm saying 

150.24 150.81 A: (( mm )) 

158.35 159.48 A: yeah 

158.82 168.58 B: because without that if you just like oh my god it's the first of the month we gotta pay the bills but last month you didn't plan it out something might be short 

168.41 169.50 A: (( mm right )) 

168.55 176.72 B: [laughter] so i'm looking for a thinker [lipsmack] and i'm looking for a person who 

176.77 180.97 B: is just kind and considerate basically that's it 

180.93 181.84 A: (( uh-huh )) 

181.23 183.78 B: so any more for you [laughter] 

183.46 195.35 A: [laughter] i think yeah you brought up a lot of good good points yeah you definitely need someone that that's a thinker keep you on your toes also you know [sigh] but yeah i mean 

191.73 192.96 B: yeah 

196.09 199.08 A: honestly i i don't know how old you are i'm only twenty five oh 

198.76 200.40 B: i'm only twenty three 

200.26 204.52 A: (( okay and you've been married twice or you have two children wow )) 

202.16 213.24 B: yes i've been married i've been married one time [lipsmack] and i that's another thing no men in my age group none because they are just so stupid 

210.61 211.81 A: (( oh okay )) 

212.94 214.17 A: that 

213.11 222.69 B: i mean [laughter] i'm serious 'cause i like 'cause okay my son's father he was [cough] uh he is one year older than me he's twenty four 

214.27 216.27 A: (( [laughter] absolutely )) 

222.58 223.53 A: mhm 

222.90 235.39 B: and he was into just standing on the corner with his friends never wanted to come home for a ren- romantic dinner never wanted to do any of that and i'm like okay come on and see women mature faster than men do 

234.96 236.08 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

235.42 241.57 B: so it was like okay what is going on here but then my daughter's father he is forty two 

241.77 255.87 B: and he does things like going to the lincoln theatre and listening to jazz concerts and just taking a blanket and going to the beach and laying out and just chilling you know something inexpensive but fun 

252.25 252.89 A: (( mhm mm )) 

253.62 254.74 A: yeah 

255.68 256.76 A: yeah 

255.77 263.80 B: that's another thing i'm looking for too that's like really cool when he does that and we just pack up the kids and pack up the car and off we go 

263.72 276.13 B: [lipsmack] so i find that younger men are more into rock and roll hip hop music and hang with my friends go to the club go to the bar but older men they're more settled 

263.93 264.56 A: yeah 

276.13 277.17 A: yeah 

276.54 279.53 B: (( and that's why i said i was looking for anyway [laughter] )) 

279.66 281.77 A: yeah that's that's true 

281.36 283.13 B: yeah so 

283.22 294.44 B: i mean there are some young guys out there just like that but some older guys are are the more settled ones yeah 'cause they alrea- they already been there and done that 

286.91 287.68 A: (( uh-huh )) 

291.23 292.37 A: yeah 

294.39 307.34 B: so they not too interested in that but now if you're like the type of person if it's a wild female she might wanna hook up with a wild male [laughter] but if you are just chilled laid back type of person 

300.68 301.83 A: (( yeah mhm [noise] )) 

302.83 303.99 A: yeah 

307.25 313.99 B: then i think you need a chilled laid back type of person to be with [laughter] you see what i'm saying [laughter] yeah 

311.08 312.00 A: yeah 

312.19 313.22 A: yeah 

313.27 318.78 A: i just want a i'd like a combination of both 'cause you know i'm still sorta just fresh out of college and 

318.80 325.57 A: yeah i still like to go to a club and party have fun but you know when it's when it's time to be serious it's time to be serious you know 

321.31 322.97 B: right 

324.42 334.41 B: exactly exactly but that's where men don't know how to draw the line at sometimes they don't 'specially young men they like it's party all the time 

329.60 330.78 A: yeah 

334.28 343.32 B: and not just it's a time for seriousness and it's a time for party that's why i want so- and he does that i mean we go and we 

334.60 335.64 A: mhm 

339.06 340.00 A: (( right )) 

343.10 352.17 B: we have we go to the club and we dance all night and we chill out with the young people but then we go home [laughter] you know what i'm saying 

346.44 347.55 A: mhm 

350.63 352.89 A: (( right exactly yeah yeah yeah )) 

352.31 362.16 B: and that's pretty cool i like that i like that so that definitely is something i'm looking for in an intimate partner even though i already have one i was like talking to you like i don't 

362.28 363.67 A: [laughter] 

362.78 364.40 B: [laughter] 

364.13 366.66 A: well that's good i don't [laughter] 

365.95 374.34 B: [laughter] well you could look for one and those guys on the internet i mean they're just plain sick 

367.54 368.21 A: (( i'm )) 

369.64 370.59 A: yeah 

371.61 372.20 A: (( mhm )) 

374.21 375.33 A: yeah 

374.58 384.01 B: i mean you meet 'em and you talk to 'em and they say everything uh uh that's another thing a man who will say anything to make 

384.62 389.24 B: you hear to tickle your ear you know what i'm saying in a figure of speech tickle your ear 

387.30 388.35 A: right 

389.37 402.04 B: that that don't seem like a good type of man to me i need somebody that's gonna tell me you're wrong [laughter] you know what i'm saying even if i don't wanna hear it because that is not only an intimate partner but that's a true friend 

395.72 396.76 A: mhm 

398.13 398.91 A: (( yeah )) 

401.97 404.46 A: (( yeah that's yeah absolutely mm [laughter] [noise] )) 

403.31 404.62 B: yeah 

404.67 407.89 B: that's another thing i'm looking for in a man true friend 

407.78 416.37 B: a true friend somebody who when i know i done did something terrible like my fiance when i done something terrible i go to him and tell him 

416.17 430.45 B: i just poke out my lip and give him the puppy dog eyes and i just tell him and he's like okay we'll work it out some kinda way or if it's something i did to him 'cause you know how females get when they get all antsy and stuff [laughter] 

429.38 430.63 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

430.88 438.68 B: and then he'll get mad he'll leave he'll come back and we'll work it out so that's i think a true friendship is another 

438.85 441.16 B: thing i'm looking for in an intimate partner 

440.97 443.97 A: yeah just being able to communicate back and forth 

443.59 445.30 B: right and it and 

444.16 445.09 A: yeah that was 

445.35 448.88 B: it got to have some money some money 

447.94 449.54 A: oh absolutely 

448.84 461.85 B: because without money you can't make it 'cause my girlfriend she had she had met this guy and he told her i love you oh so much and i wanna be with you forever and you're gonna raise my kids and all this stuff 

461.69 466.21 B: and she rushed out of her mother's house and bought this apartment and moved in with him 

466.23 468.10 B: and a month later he left 

468.15 469.06 A: (( mm oh oh )) 

468.65 478.33 B: [laughter] so she's stuck with this apartment what's like seven hundred and fifty dollars in rent and she doesn't even make that much money in a month so she's like really struggling 

476.50 477.08 A: (( mm )) 

478.26 487.18 B: so the and the reason for the whole thing was because he had told her that he had made money and he had money saved up and he didn't 

487.15 488.25 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

487.54 496.00 B: and so i'm like i'm trying to tell her i said it doesn't she said well i'm in love for the person 

496.01 509.79 B: that's a good thing you should be in love for the person himself but the person also got to have money because it's a terrible thing which i've been there and done that with my first husband it's a terrible terrible thing to be in love and on the street 

510.10 511.74 B: (( [laughter] you know what i'm saying )) 

510.21 511.15 A: yeah 

511.51 520.71 A: yeah i mean i'm not looking for you know the a millionaire but just somebody that can pull their weight you know that could live on their own and not depend 

517.02 519.02 B: right exactly 

520.74 523.34 A: you know depend on me to do support him 

520.83 521.97 B: exactly 

523.02 528.72 B: right right that's what i'm saying that's what i'm talking about 'cause that is a terrible feeling 

523.49 525.24 A: that yeah 

528.52 529.58 A: (( mhm mm )) 

528.95 533.53 B: well you'd you you know you wanna be with this person and 

533.78 536.98 B: this person is broke so either you got two options 

537.09 541.58 B: you either keep him and work harder and carry him or 

541.91 543.11 B: you gotta let him go 

543.20 547.40 B: [laughter] but you're in love so what do you do [laughter] you k now what i'm saying 

543.28 544.32 A: yeah 

546.96 548.40 A: yeah that's that's 

547.45 560.07 B: so that's why i say that is the number one requirement you must be able to support yourself and maybe a little extra for me i wouldn't mind a man who'll give me twenty dollars say go get your nails done [laughter] you know what i'm saying 

559.26 560.31 A: yeah 

559.96 572.33 B: i like going get my nails done [lipsmack] oh and a man who massage your feet [laughter] i love getting my feet massaged so that works for me [laughter] 

564.56 565.84 A: [laughter] 

569.66 570.44 A: (( uh-huh )) 

572.85 575.26 A: (( [laughter] i hear that )) 

573.28 574.54 B: (( yeah )) 

575.45 577.34 B: anything else for you
