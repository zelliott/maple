0.44 1.64 B: hi 

1.86 4.76 A: hi this is sheila i'm in ohio 

4.52 6.96 B: i'm pat and i'm in uh illinois [noise] 

6.54 7.67 A: okay 

8.01 12.54 A: um our topic i guess is what to look for in a life partner 

12.07 13.03 B: right 

12.56 13.51 A: [laughter] 

14.45 20.01 A: i guess for me we we've been married nineteen years this year and for me it's um 

20.18 20.74 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

20.56 23.50 B: well we've been married uh for thirty six years 

22.81 24.40 A: oh my gosh 

23.63 25.73 B: we went to grammar school together 

24.87 27.00 A: [laughter] oh wow 

27.30 29.35 B: we lived across the street from each other 

29.19 30.89 A: well that's pretty good 

30.21 32.92 B: (( yeah but [noise] )) 

30.91 38.52 A: we didn't meet 'til we were um older both outta college but um i was glad i waited because it seemed to have worked out well 

38.26 49.36 B: well i think the thing that people need to look for in this modern day of age is somebody that's got the same morals and character as yourself as far as religion and work ethnics and 

45.16 46.39 A: right 

49.50 56.25 B: first finding out they not on drugs and that they straight there's so many things that you have to be weary of today 

56.05 58.14 A: right yeah i agree 

56.62 61.67 B: compared to back when we were you know dating and going out with people you know 

62.53 73.54 B: that you know it was pretty much safe back then compared to now there's so many different things but you know that's what makes it so hard for young people to find the right compatible person 

65.00 65.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

73.62 76.26 A: yeah i think it's a lot tougher for people now 

75.41 78.94 B: mhm yeah because so many people 

79.28 83.13 B: they pretend to be one thing until you really get with him and then 

83.44 91.25 B: you find out that they are entirely different you know a lotta guys nowadays don't even wanna work you know even 

87.12 88.33 A: right 

90.53 91.54 A: yeah 

91.19 102.04 B: you know or they go and then they mess up their money you know 'cause they wasn't raised that they wanna a a wife or a girlfriend or someone to live with but when nowadays come 

101.95 112.44 B: with so many things of of their own of having their own car their own houses and everything and just opening up their doors to share that with somebody is something they really don't wanna do 

102.99 105.53 A: (( [noise] )) 

107.76 109.01 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

112.37 113.66 A: right 

113.36 116.21 B: especially when no one has nothing to bring to the table 

116.29 118.54 A: right 

117.69 119.80 B: so i think you know 

119.85 131.48 B: that makes it harder and women are pursuing careers longer and then a lotta people also don't get together because so many young people have all these student loans to pay back also 

131.69 144.82 A: yeah i think it is a lot different i i think too there's so much divorce now that people you know you don't see that many people being married a long time anymore like i know my parents' age i think it's just they they make it too easy 

140.75 142.39 B: well it's so easy 

144.41 159.32 B: right and and they can just it's e- if they make it as hard to get married as it is to get unmarried maybe people would would think about it you know longer also they're so easy to give up but it's it's just like a job it's 

151.29 152.43 A: yeah [laughter] 

159.21 162.02 B: hard work you have to put work into it 

161.69 163.40 A: right i agree 

162.11 171.08 B: it's just like i just came in from a meeting and so dinner was ready and my husband said well i went out to the restaurant and got some food i got you some too well i 

170.84 171.74 A: (( wow )) 

170.96 181.16 B: bought home some food with me you can work and we can eat it tomorrow you know we think about each other you know other people people are more selfish nowadays 

175.32 176.81 A: yeah that was nice 

176.90 178.12 A: right 

180.92 182.62 A: right i agree 

182.01 187.57 B: you know it's all for self you know not thinking about what the next person's gonna have to do you know if 

187.26 189.69 A: right do you have kids 

187.78 188.76 B: (( if ))

196.79 198.18 B: mhm 

197.56 204.55 A: so one thing too that's important to me is that he's you know involved with the kids i see a lotta men that aren't 

202.50 203.67 B: mhm 

204.37 217.20 B: right like my husband washed their hands he combed hair and did all those things helped with homework and you know we got grand kids and you know we have six grandchildren a set of twins

213.21 214.17 A: oh 

215.65 216.86 A: oh wow [laughter] 

217.30 218.23 A: oh 

218.18 221.19 B: and you know we've helped with all of them like uh 

221.25 224.24 B: the oldest boy he's twelve and he's 

224.28 236.74 B: i'm sending him to a christian camp this uh summer well he's been to a lotta the other ones you know my husband said well if that's what you wanna do you know you work you know go ahead and get it for him you know 

230.68 231.65 A: yeah 

235.96 237.86 A: yeah that's nice 

237.18 240.86 B: yeah and uh you know you help out where you can you know 

240.79 249.99 A: yeah i'm sure they appreciate it my mother passed away right before our first one was born so that's been hard not having a grandmother for her but 

244.12 245.24 B: mhm 

246.94 247.95 B: yeah 

249.52 250.66 B: yeah 

250.10 252.30 A: for any of them but um it's 

252.59 257.09 A: so i think that's great when people are involved with their kids like that my dad's real involved 

255.18 256.09 B: yeah 

256.71 265.53 B: yeah and our my parents and you know our parents helped with our upbringing of our kids 'cause like when our oldest boy was 

265.71 276.02 B: first in kindergarten my father had just retired and that's what he loved to do he wanted to pick him up from school and take him to his dentist appointments and all that kinda stuff you know 

275.51 276.77 A: mhm 

276.13 279.72 B: and so uh you know we try to help out too 

280.38 288.26 B: well we let them know that we do have a life you know and and that uh like we just went to walt disney this summer you know uh and uh 

282.66 283.64 A: [laughter] 

285.78 286.94 A: oh wow 

288.49 296.80 B: people at our jobs asked were we taking the grand kids we said no they got parents that's for that's their job we're going to enjoy ourselves 

292.92 294.65 A: [laughter] 

296.05 300.03 A: you'll be like those commercials where the um older people are enjoying 

297.25 299.37 B: yeah we just like that commercial 

299.70 310.93 B: that's right we were just like that we were just like that and i have a friend that lives there and we you know they had us over for dinner and took us out on their boat and everything 

300.25 301.72 A: walt disney too 

310.47 311.47 A: (( [mn] )) 

310.96 316.44 B: and they don't have any little children so we said no we're not taking no kids [laughter] 

315.05 316.26 A: [laughter] 

316.41 324.76 A: yeah that's nice well i think that's important too that couples doing stuff together like that i think a lotta people they just kinda live their own lives 

324.16 327.02 B: right they live separate lives and uh 

327.24 332.99 B: they they want to be married but they don't want all the responsibility that goes along with it 

332.78 334.06 A: right 

333.86 347.04 B: like my youngest daughter she works and she she's going to school finishing up her nursing degree she is a nurse too well her husband works nights well he cooks dinner and he washes clothes and all that well it takes two people you know 

346.53 347.88 A: right 

347.19 358.68 B: one person can't do it all and especially when you're doing so many other things you know it doesn't take a rocket scientist to put on a little food to eat he wants to eat dinner you know 

349.13 350.02 A: (( uh-huh )) 

356.66 359.57 A: [laughter] right 

359.75 360.88 B: and uh 

360.07 361.46 A: yeah 

361.11 367.07 B: and it makes it easier for the person that's coming in especially the one that gotta be bothered by the kids in the evening time 

367.03 368.22 A: right 

367.48 380.02 B: be- because before you know it like you you may get home at six o'clock by the time you get the kids sat down to eat and bathed and their hair done for the next day and checking homework i tell ya the evening's over with 

379.74 380.76 A: right 

380.90 386.18 A: well it seems like it goes fast the one thing i see with our next we have a ten 

386.22 398.57 A: seven five and then the baby and it just goes so fast now i'm like trying to enjoy it more 'cause before i just seemed kinda overwhelmed but now i'm just trying to enjoy it [laughter] but now this one's it [laughter] 

388.29 389.17 B: mhm 

390.26 391.19 B: right 

395.93 397.36 B: (( right that just )) 

398.18 402.83 B: yeah uh the ten month old at least they got older kids to play with too 

401.98 403.96 A: yeah that's nice 

403.31 407.82 B: yeah they can take over some of the playing especially 

407.35 410.03 A: right they yeah they help out a lot 

409.31 411.47 B: yeah the ten year old is pretty 

411.20 416.24 A: yes and she really likes babies so that worked out good [laughter] 

411.55 412.99 B: self-sufficient 

413.64 418.30 B: yeah yeah especially with that being a girl girls always wanna be a mommy 

417.90 425.01 A: yeah yeah she enjoys him quite a bit he's the first boy so he's probably getting spoilt but [laughter] 

419.59 420.73 B: mhm 

421.70 422.70 B: yeah 

423.42 425.82 B: yeah he'll be one of those spoiled guys 

425.61 426.99 A: yeah 

426.37 429.04 B: that have a bunch of women catering to him 

428.16 431.66 A: [laughter] yeah 

429.12 430.34 B: (( [laughter] )) 

431.20 445.92 B: yeah and that's another thing about making it harder for young people together because they have older siblings or they come from families that have money and they're used to having their way and then they get married or get with a life 

445.82 458.03 B: companion and it just doesn't work the same way as what your sisters and brothers or like when you were at home you know you have to work things out together you just can't say i'm gonna do this and that just think you 

452.95 453.89 A: yeah 

458.06 460.40 B: take money and just go here and do it 

460.19 471.01 A: yeah well i notice like my husband was the oldest in his family and i think i was in the middle but i've noticed some of the sometimes if a person was the youngest they seem to 

460.92 461.78 B: (( you know )) 

470.99 476.49 A: not be quite as willing to work [laughter] maybe they had too much they could get out of 

473.43 475.71 B: right they're more spoilt 

475.90 476.87 B: right 

477.58 488.55 B: yeah and um you know nowadays a a lotta people have kids and they give 'em so much that when they get grown that they figure that's gonna be the same way when they get a partner 

483.45 484.56 A: yeah 

488.64 490.78 B: and it doesn't work that way either 

490.51 491.44 A: right 

492.31 496.35 B: you know it's like a a give and a share situation 

496.79 502.17 B: and and especially when kids are involved you have to make those sacrifices for your children 

502.38 505.07 B: your needs have to be put on the back burner 

505.51 507.30 A: (( yeah )) 

506.02 508.49 B: especially 'til the kids get older 

508.69 513.48 B: and then kids that are at home you know longer they you know you've got all their college to 

513.55 517.19 B: try to pay for and astronomical mortgages 

517.35 522.30 A: yeah did you find out about this study from the internet or
