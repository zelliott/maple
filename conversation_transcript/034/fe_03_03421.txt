108.07 109.14 A: you know 

110.09 118.64 A: [mn] you know when we were when i was a a man growing up and and and doing the crazy things and looking for women and stuff of that nature um 

119.31 121.91 A: it wasn't a life sentence if you got screwed up 

121.26 122.56 B: yeah 

122.43 130.11 A: you know now [mn] aids and stuff you got to be very careful about not just who they've been with but everybody they've been with 

128.73 129.97 B: yeah 

130.20 132.07 A: and that's scary 

131.21 138.50 B: yeah it is it is real scary it is very and and it's interesting too i i don't know if you 

133.86 135.34 A: (( you know i )) 

138.44 146.59 B: share the same experience i do but i don't know you know i i remember you know being a being a youngster um 

146.87 150.72 B: you know graduated from college and all that stuff you're thinking uh 

150.74 155.90 B: you know you kind of got in your head what you're looking for and you know at that point in time you're looking for uh 

155.67 156.34 A: [mn] 

155.89 167.62 B: better make sure i get away from my wife here but you're you know it it leaves me i'm looking for [mn] you know the blonde haired um you know athletic uh you know good figure you know type of woman 

167.47 168.52 A: mhm 

167.47 182.23 B: and uh you know that's just your picture and or my picture in my head of my ideal woman well very interesting that my wife is you know quite different than that but you know it's like you may have a picture in your head and you may think you know what you want but you know it's not like you uh 

175.81 177.41 A: mhm 

182.26 192.83 B: you know you go out and you just you know you seek out people that are exactly what you think you want i mean sometimes it just kind of happens and you know you fall in love and boom you know there you are 

192.57 199.11 A: yeah well but the first thing there's got to be there's some sort of an attraction somewhere before you'd even talk to that individual 

198.47 202.09 B: right absolutely yeah 

201.00 206.16 A: i know for myself i was before i met my wife i was dating this young lady that that uh 

207.04 215.41 A: well when i first met her i i she had just broken up with some fella and and things were real rocky but i decided that i was going to date this lady 

215.44 222.87 A: come hell or high water and i did ended up being with her almost five years but uh 

223.52 226.58 A: i wouldn't want to go through that again it was a bad experience i 

227.08 231.77 A: she ran around on me the whole time i was just was too blind to see 

230.58 231.86 B: yeah 

232.07 234.77 A: so it wasn't a good situation 

234.12 237.30 B: yeah yeah that's the scary 

235.73 240.76 A: but i i i it [laughter] after i got her i wasn't so sure 

240.41 242.17 B: yeah 

241.58 242.17 A: (( [laughter] )) 

242.80 249.77 B: yeah that's the scary thing is i don't know i guess especially nowadays it just seems like there's so much of that going on that you 

249.62 260.95 B: you know even though you maybe you think you know somebody you know that you're dating but you know at some in [mn] in so many cases it seems to turn out that you really never knew 'em at all you know they're [mn] 

253.90 255.71 A: mhm 

260.61 267.54 A: that's why the divorce rate is so high most people just take that for granted that oh well if it doesn't work out i'll just get a divorce and that'll be it 

266.93 267.86 B: yeah 

267.89 268.66 B: (( yeah )) 

268.12 274.39 A: and unfortunately that's not the way it's supposed to work but that's the way most people think that now it seems like 

270.54 271.45 B: right 

272.30 273.66 B: yeah you're right 

275.34 277.60 B: yeah you're right yeah i wouldn't [cough] 

275.44 276.96 A: (( [mn] 'cause you )) 

277.02 286.82 A: know i've got i've got a daughter that's seven years old she goes to school and and and she can tell i bet she can tell you on one hand how many pe- people have the the original same two parents that they had when they started 

286.16 288.34 B: right yeah 

287.46 289.62 A: (( you know and that's said )) 

288.99 290.47 B: yeah it is 

290.68 293.48 A: (( you know that's a that's a shame )) 

291.21 292.17 B: it is 

293.03 307.88 B: yeah i mean i think you're right you know uh with everything we see in the media and you know newspaper t._v. and all that stuff that seems to be the the kind of attitude that people have nowadays is you know like you said hey if it doesn't work out [mn] it's not big deal just get a divorce and you know 

307.09 309.83 A: yeah get a divorce and just go on i'll find somebody else 

309.16 310.05 B: yeah 

310.62 312.46 B: (( yeah or )) 

311.50 312.81 A: that's ridiculous 

313.33 314.48 B: yeah i mean 

313.60 314.97 A: in the long run 

314.75 315.94 B: yeah 

316.21 317.47 B: yeah it's 

316.57 327.69 A: 'cause 'cau- if you're not careful you're going to get somebody's that very vindictive one way or the other either him or her and [mn] it's just not a good situation for the children or any children to have to go through that 

325.85 328.29 B: yeah yeah 

328.89 332.37 B: yeah that's the worst thing is when you you know realize 

332.42 343.51 B: maybe it's not really going to work and by that time you already got a couple of kids or you know three or four kids and that that just makes it even wor- you know even more complicated 

337.01 338.89 A: mhm 

342.78 344.75 A: right 

344.52 346.02 B: but uh 

346.20 353.43 B: yeah it's it's kind of funny um you know i i i actually got married when i was uh twenty two 

353.54 360.16 B: and uh you know i look back and i think you know man i was lucky 'cause i was really stupid back then i mean 

360.10 374.48 B: my wife and i um we actually only dated for probably about six months and i was military stationed in fort campbell kentucky and i was driving you know home every weekend or [mn] to alabama every weekend to see her 

373.55 375.24 A: mhm 

374.43 381.37 B: and uh that just got old and you know we we felt like we were in love and we felt like we were ready and uh 

376.87 377.79 A: quickly [laughter] 

381.32 393.36 B: we just went and got married and looking back i'm thinking you know that was probably the probably the the stupidest thing i ever did in terms of you know having such a short period of time to get to know somebody 

393.06 393.97 A: right 

393.13 397.84 B: to decide you want to spend the rest of your life with them but you know um 

397.87 404.35 B: it's it's worked out i mean and it's weird that as we've been together you know year after year 

404.35 417.20 B: um you know as as we really got to know each other we both liked what we found and you know it it could have turned out i say it was a stupid thing to do because you know it could have turned out exactly the opposite we could have 

417.19 428.16 B: realized that we maybe there's a physical attraction but we didn't you know necessarily see eye to eye on a lot of things and we really didn't like any of the same things and we just weren't compatible 

428.21 429.34 A: (( [mn] yeah [mn] )) 

428.26 430.75 B: so we lucked out big time 

430.04 439.17 A: [cough] 'scuse me yeah and it's tough being in the military and be in that situation too uh it's it's hard on the family especially like these guys just coming back from overseas 

438.85 440.08 B: yeah 

439.79 448.10 A: you know [mn] it [mn] i seen 'em on the news this morning with a young lady said well he's been gone about five five months this time 

447.47 448.73 B: yeah 

448.97 454.26 A: that's tough that's a tough separation i don't care who it is that's tough on you 

450.94 451.88 B: yes 

452.66 453.83 B: it is 

453.97 456.94 B: yeah that's the longest i've been away 

457.09 465.99 B: is about five months and it's weird i mean it's you know you come back and it's almost like you have to get to know your family all over again i mean it's just 

464.87 468.20 A: well yeah if if you got little ones you miss all that time 

467.58 469.39 B: yeah yeah 

468.44 474.17 A: how can you that's that's the sad part i couldn't imagine missing some of my daughter's growing up 

473.53 486.14 B: yeah well and they've got the uh you know besides the stuff that just went on they have [mn] you know they have tours of duty in korea that are you know one year tours away from your family you know your family generally doesn't go 

474.98 475.89 A: so 

481.76 483.52 A: mhm 

486.01 487.16 A: right 

486.34 489.40 B: well they don't go on a one year tour anywhere 

489.23 494.30 B: and uh you go to korea and usually you get a mid tour break you know about thirty days 

494.19 495.92 A: mhm 

494.21 504.90 B: you know you come back most guys'll come back around christmastime and uh spend christmas with their families but i mean that's a whole year or you know six months at a time pretty much that you're gone 

497.43 499.17 A: mhm 

504.79 513.12 A: yeah yeah i i understand that situation when i was in the military in in the early seventies i was spent seventeen and a half months in okinawa 

505.14 506.11 B: and uh 

512.97 514.16 B: uh 

514.74 517.02 A: yeah [laughter] 

515.27 517.66 B: yep yeah you know the deal 

517.36 519.83 A: oh yes yeah and uh 

520.80 532.55 A: matter of fact i i came back i was st- stationed at marine barracks jacksonville naval in jacksonville and the sergeant major wanted me to go to japan with him and i'm like the first time i i said to my god i just got back i don't really think i want to go back overseas 

532.13 533.86 B: yeah 

533.63 536.11 A: that was a mistake i should've gone 

536.16 539.06 A: but you know that's hindsight 

539.23 540.44 B: yeah 

540.81 549.60 A: yeah [mn] just cause you never can tell what's going to happen if i'd a went back i maybe would never have met my wife and that's that that'd been r- that'd been real sad 

549.11 551.54 B: yeah yeah you're right 

550.87 551.57 A: (( you know )) 

552.03 554.15 B: you never know what might have happened 

554.26 559.35 A: true i like we been married like i said almost ninete- almost twenty years and uh 

560.05 561.23 A: it's uh 

561.26 566.98 A: [mn] i just couldn't imagine not being here her not being around even for a short period of time that would drive me crazy 

566.24 567.75 B: yeah 

568.17 569.02 A: so 

568.43 571.93 B: yeah i can't even imagine some of these guys you know and i i don't 

571.89 582.68 B: necessarily place 'em in the same category as the you know the military you know when they're deployed in an operation like you know like we just had but you know some of these guys that work in uh 

579.89 581.69 A: mhm 

582.50 593.92 B: you know professional sports you know these coaches and stuff during the season i mean those guys are gone all the time i don't see how they you know make their marriages last and you you know get to know their kids 

591.90 593.58 A: [mn] it's got to be rough 

593.86 596.44 A: got to be rough on everybody involved 

595.70 599.95 B: yeah i mean i've got a neighbor who's a high school football coach and you know during the s-
