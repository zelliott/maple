208.42 208.98 B: (( [mn] ))

253.61 256.39 B: that is definitely it makes everything so much easier 

256.30 257.38 A: mhm 

258.06 264.37 B: definitely someone who will just be there for you even though when you think you can't do something they know you can 

264.69 267.77 A: right and they will tell you can 

268.13 269.76 A: (( and it )) 

269.77 272.05 A: (( so encouragement )) 

272.33 273.83 A: is good 

273.19 274.14 B: mm 

274.78 276.70 A: you know um 

277.04 280.27 A: somebody who can encourage you to do your best 

280.52 282.82 B: right that is true 

283.88 292.00 B: god there's so many how come there's so many bad men out there [laughter] with so many qualities you'd think they could possess some of them 

292.25 303.83 A: [laughter] yeah what you need is about five guys you know you can find one that has these qualities and another that has these other qualities and then you got it made right 

299.82 302.20 B: [laughter] 

303.14 305.70 B: oh yeah so 

304.87 310.62 A: but you know there really are some good guys out there it's they're hard to find 

309.66 314.79 B: yeah that is true they're definitely hard to find [laughter] i'm trying but it's hard 

312.70 313.69 A: yeah 

315.18 317.01 A: well you're only twenty four 

316.52 318.18 B: yeah 

317.58 319.70 A: my daughter's twenty six 

319.72 327.16 A: she's got a while to go yet and that's fine i'm not in any hurry for her to get married but i want her to find the right guy 

321.72 322.51 B: mm 

327.00 329.77 B: right people are getting married later these days anyway 

330.03 335.39 A: yeah and that's part of the problem is they don't have the qualities 

335.48 340.24 A: for the life partner that are absolutely necessary 

340.43 343.24 A: you know they're looking for the 

343.28 346.90 A: right now type thing in so many ways 

346.36 347.34 B: mm 

347.38 351.16 A: and you know they'll go for the guy who 

351.35 353.68 A: makes them happy at the moment 

354.36 357.13 A: but they don't stop to realize 

357.49 360.13 A: you know ten years down the road 

361.50 364.86 A: there's got to be more to this marriage than 

364.92 370.72 A: what we have right now and does he possess those qualities or she 

370.89 372.31 A: if it's a man 

372.51 376.80 A: you know does this person have those qualities 

376.81 378.61 A: that will be there 

378.79 381.97 A: thirty years from now forty years from now 

382.35 384.14 A: that i can deal with 

384.35 386.10 B: right that's why 

384.48 386.40 A: you know maybe they 

386.56 387.76 A: go ahead 

387.10 400.80 B: that's why so many marriages end in divorce i mean we're up to like a fifty percent divorce rate and you're like the rarity of being at thirty years i mean if if you make it three or seven years it's like a long term relationship [laughter] 

389.76 390.74 A: mhm 

400.55 406.61 A: yeah well i even talked to a girl the other day who said her marriage lasted twenty days 

406.21 407.62 B: wow 

408.13 411.95 A: and i thought now this is really sad 

411.67 414.21 B: that is that's ridiculous [noise] 

413.70 420.24 A: yeah and she was a wedding coordinator and i thought honey you're in the wrong business [laughter] 

418.03 422.10 B: (( [laughter] oh god )) 

421.63 423.33 A: but um 

423.63 428.48 A: no i do think that it is important to look at the whole 

428.64 429.89 A: person 

430.97 432.92 A: as a concept 

432.28 433.24 B: mm 

433.20 435.97 A: as opposed to just one 

436.61 438.44 A: characteristic 

439.41 442.27 A: and too many times i think that's what they do 

442.05 447.81 B: right people marry for someone's looks but you know looks aren't don't last forever and 

448.00 448.78 A: (( [mn] )) 

448.47 452.76 B: you need someone who's gonna be solid for for not just now but forever 

453.61 458.91 A: and i think probably to say it best is you need somebody who is more 

459.50 463.68 A: concerned with the unit 

463.93 464.82 B: mm 

465.05 469.72 A: somebody who you know wants the unit itself to work 

469.80 473.26 A: as opposed to just being in love with you 

473.57 476.96 B: right the we instead of the i or the you 

474.78 475.75 A: you know 

475.84 479.28 A: yeah he wants the whole family 

479.48 482.87 A: if you know if you were to decide you were gonna have kids 

483.01 489.13 A: 'cause if you don't that's okay too whatever your lifestyle is but he's got to want 

489.44 495.68 A: the family unit to work regardless of what it is more than 

496.02 498.89 A: he does just being married 

498.54 499.51 B: mm 

500.15 501.39 B: that is true 

502.67 505.79 A: so maybe that's the 

507.28 513.27 A: the characteristics that he has to have is wanting us 

514.03 516.64 B: so how did you make it to thirty years 

518.14 523.07 A: a lotta patience a lotta trust a lot of love um 

524.23 525.55 A: um 

526.87 530.98 A: it really does take every single one of those 

531.19 532.86 A: on both parts 

532.95 534.29 A: and 

534.37 543.77 A: any time you get angry with one another sit down and talk about it make it you know work try to understand what made you angry 

544.14 545.69 B: mm that is 

544.90 548.01 A: and how to correct it 

548.30 549.90 B: that is a good idea [noise] 

549.82 552.83 A: and yeah don't just let it sit there 

553.00 555.80 A: uh we raised two kids as well 

556.60 560.56 A: and he also worked s- shift work 

561.57 566.24 A: so that was important he was an air traffic controller 

565.86 568.00 B: oh wow that's a stressful job 

567.93 576.58 A: uh-huh so you know it took a lot of patience and a lot of trust and everything with that kind of a job 

577.16 578.97 A: and 

582.87 584.62 A: a lot of understanding 

585.20 587.90 B: that's also a b- big thing understanding 

587.82 594.13 A: yeah 'cause i needed to understand where he was coming from with his job and everything else 

594.20 599.89 A: uh but he needed to understand you know that i had challenges at home even with the 

599.27 599.95 B: (( [noise] ))
