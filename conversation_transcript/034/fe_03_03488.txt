72.71 86.24 B: well i mean basically she kinda started off for us and basically we both came up with the conclusion like within the first minute that it's basically 

86.43 89.57 B: compatibility and like uh 

90.09 95.95 B: and uh trustworthiness you know we didn't really figure out too many more 

95.29 109.86 A: oh man i [mn] that's crazy i don't even have any i don't think life partner is like a real isn't that the thing what is that life partner is that what she said oh okay yeah i don't i don't believe that person or that

112.35 119.78 A: yeah i don't even believe that stuff i just i just think you go through a series of people and and then do the best you can 

113.76 115.33 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

119.87 126.52 A: i think that's a more romantic a more romantic way of looking at it but i don't think it's like uh realistic 

119.98 121.16 B: yeah i 

126.27 140.19 B: have i have more of a tendency to go with that as well i mean 'cause i i used to be married and and got divorced and yeah it's like you can always think think that things are you know 

140.04 144.72 B: spectacular or whatever and then two years later they're shit or something you know 

144.30 150.52 A: yeah exactly yeah i went through the same thing uh i married really young and i got divorced and uh 

150.55 155.93 A: i heard that over and over like i've been through with a series of girls like 

156.41 161.29 A: uh and it's always the same thing it's like really cool and you guys um 

161.45 172.81 A: hit it off and then after like a year or two whatever [mn] um things change and people grow i mean you know they want different things a lotta time you come to the relationship 

173.13 178.05 A: [lipsmack] you know um people are not perfectly honest with each other even though they try to be 

177.67 179.58 B: yeah exactly 

178.10 180.26 A: but everybody's got their own uh 

180.27 182.09 A: underlying agenda 

182.12 187.58 B: or they will possibly try and make themselves look a little better than they actually are you know 

182.12 183.10 A: (( you know )) 

187.21 189.49 A: yeah 

187.61 193.12 B: you you don't point out your downfalls you know you just go oh yeah you know you try to point your 

193.16 196.05 B: positive points and then as time goes on they 

196.23 198.25 B: see the negative points 

198.20 211.61 A: yeah they start learning a major goal because a lotta times you don't even know your your negative things you're so used to [mn] you know living in 'em you can't really see 'em until that's the only good about you get a relationship that you can learn 

211.64 215.83 A: like all the shit that you've done to this girl you kinda look back and say well 

215.68 217.56 B: yeah i learned a lot 

216.00 226.66 A: yeah maybe i am an asshole [laughter] maybe i am an asshole and this point of view or this but i don't think it's gonna change so i'm just gonna have to find somebody that can put up with it [laughter] 

217.73 218.78 B: yeah 

225.79 237.86 B: actually you know what i i think it kinda has changed it's like i i learned so much you know from like being like you said i mean like being an asshole to my ex and stuff you know like i used to 

237.82 252.03 B: just hang out with friends and say i was like whatever i'll see ya later and just you know i've i don't i mean i i didn't think i was that bad at the time you know 'cause i mean i was trying to make things work but it's like 

247.96 249.00 A: (( mhm )) 

250.95 251.80 A: yeah 

251.89 257.67 B: now like the the current girlfriend i have we we kinda joke about the fact that 

257.69 263.98 B: we've like switched roles you know it's like i'm almost kinda the girl in the relationship you know it's like i'm all 

264.23 272.41 B: with her now you know instead of being like the prick i used to be that would just slag off on all the other girlfriends i had and [mn] 

271.37 274.98 A: yeah yeah yeah that's right yeah i agree with you and then 

275.00 280.03 A: and then who knows and then she might break your heart this girl and then next time you're gonna be 

280.13 283.84 A: uh butt wipe again to the next girl and then it'd be like a cycle 

283.60 284.92 B: yeah 

284.27 286.89 A: but you know you always learn as you go 

286.63 290.94 B: actually that that thought has crossed my mind a few times but 

290.31 293.74 A: [laughter] yeah it's crossed mine more than a few times 

293.89 300.18 A: so i just kinda like it gives me like a a brain headache you know 'cause you like you know it's uh 

300.21 308.95 A: is is is there really a god kind of a thing you don't know the answers and i don't think you never will you're just trying to just do the best you can and figure it out as you go 

307.37 308.62 B: (( exactly )) 

309.85 312.34 B: yeah well see it's like i 

312.59 321.12 B: completely like made myself desensitized quite a while ago you know i was just like [mn] you know fuck whatever you know no emotion and you know 

321.01 329.08 B: and now i'm finding myself you know being emotional again and so every once in a while i worry about that and you know 

329.56 332.44 B: think about exactly that you know i could get 

332.53 336.77 B: you know butt hurt by his chick and then you have to 

336.84 342.34 B: you know then where am i gonna be am i gonna start the cycle again or am i going back to the way i was before

435.53 448.67 A: the the d. j. guy is a young guy he's like yeah well before i did my song it was about a relationship and he said i don't i you're a good singer and everything but i don't really like guys to talk about that girlfriend stuff i hate that 

447.48 450.10 B: [laughter] 

449.37 454.51 A: and i go well i guess you don't like the song then [laughter] and i'd already finished the damn song too 

454.35 455.42 A: but uh 

455.18 470.00 A: i mean that's the way it goes like sometimes i play at clubs and you know people are like you know oh well whatever and then like one time this girl came to me and she was like wow that was like really cool you know pulled me aside so it all depends you know when i was talking to her 

469.96 471.03 A: that she 

470.01 471.37 B: what kind of music 

471.06 483.74 A: well yeah and what you're going through in your own life she just went through just barely broke up with somebody and was single and going through that period of mourning type of thing so that kinda song means a lot to her but i suppose that she went out 

479.38 480.44 B: right 

483.57 488.21 A: like next time i played she had a new boyfriend and everything's all peachy keen and she's got over the last one

544.68 546.35 B: [laughter] pretty much 

545.81 551.66 A: [laughter] yeah i know that that's what i mean that's why i was like if someone said it's it's primeval it's 

546.68 547.24 B: (( [mn] )) 

552.48 565.52 A: it's it's girls are meant to keep you held down for a while so that you know it's all biological so you could help 'em the kids but then naturally you've gotta on and uh fertilize you know you know 

565.37 579.61 A: the other girls around so i mean it's all biological and it it just works that way and sometimes you watch the discovery channel and you see the way they do it the analogy and you're going well that's the way we act that way i mean we're more civilized than monkeys but still 

579.72 584.18 A: it's the same frigging thing [laughter] kinda sad 

581.67 583.25 B: yeah i'm trying to 

583.81 587.58 B: i'm trying to stay away from any uh fertilizing 

587.06 594.91 A: [laughter] oh yeah no you don't wanna do that especially around here the district attorney would grab your ass and take everything 

594.49 599.66 B: oh yeah they got alimony down here too i'm from washington up there they don't have alimony
