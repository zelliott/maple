60.82 75.80 A: you know i [mn] you know got into some counseling and the counselor said well if looks is what you like then you're not gonna be happy unless you get the looks that you want you know so yeah so you know or the person has to at least be somewhere near what you

75.63 77.37 B: yeah 

76.09 79.71 A: think they look they should look like and all like that

107.78 113.39 B: i think it has an important aspect would be willing to learn together 

113.71 115.80 A: yeah yeah [noise] 

116.94 122.06 B: 'cause if you can learn with each other and grow with each other then that is really important 

121.69 124.83 A: [noise] and i think that is you know that is a big 

125.00 131.23 A: you know being able to grow with each other because if one is growing and the other one isn't you know you're you're gonna grow apart 

130.39 132.79 B: [noise] [noise] yeah exactly 

134.21 137.37 B: [sigh] definitely and you have to have the same 

137.80 141.53 B: goals in life or the same type of goals in life 

141.10 142.99 A: yeah 

142.97 144.85 B: like whether or not to have children 

144.77 146.87 A: uh that's that's im- important 

146.86 148.49 B: yeah 

147.61 149.82 A: it it surprises how many people uh 

149.84 153.96 A: get into relationships and that's something they never talked about 

153.81 156.91 B: [lipsmack] or how many children they each want 

155.64 157.33 A: yeah uh-huh 

156.92 164.48 B: you know the the wife wants three and the husband wants one and [sigh] you know what do you do then [laughter] 

163.15 164.92 A: [laughter] 

166.20 171.24 B: [sigh] or [laughter] or uh their viewpoints on 

171.28 176.17 B: i think viewpoints on religion and lifestyle should also match 

175.42 178.15 A: yeah yeah that's important i 

178.28 182.45 A: think religion is a big one religion is a real real big one 

180.37 182.28 B: yeah 

182.36 185.16 B: oh definitely either the same 

183.23 185.76 A: yeah i'm not so much you know 

186.34 192.84 A: i guess you know if different religions people with different religions um sometimes [noise] 

193.91 197.48 A: you you have to have somebody in that same religion or or you know 

197.38 201.16 B: yeah or somebody that 

198.10 198.67 A: (( [mn] )) 

199.15 203.62 A: i was thinking like jewish or or catholics especially you know they seem to 

202.07 204.31 B: (( um yeah )) 

203.71 208.91 A: not be able to deal with people that that aren't that the the same religion 

209.29 210.52 B: that's true 

210.22 222.44 A: i think if one person's religious and another is not maybe you know not necessarily an atheist but just is not as religious that might be okay but in in some reli- some religions but not all of 'em 

221.99 228.14 B: yeah there's a lot of 'em out there that have strange um belief systems 

227.61 229.47 A: yeah 

228.84 235.94 B: so [sigh] you know and [laughter] this is gonna sound funny but whether or not you're a clean freak 

236.13 237.28 B: or 

236.16 238.38 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

237.47 241.63 B: you know do you make your bed every morning or do you 

241.64 251.71 B: you know forget to put the clothes in the laundry hamper and will that drive your mate totally bonkers [laughter] 

246.86 250.61 A: yeah [laughter] 

251.92 253.07 B: (( [sigh] )) 

251.99 255.83 A: you know but if if there's a lot of little things then they're gonna add up 

255.86 257.36 B: (( [noise] yes )) 

256.07 261.89 A: you know and it's gonna be you know all kinds of strife going on because you got all these little things adding up 

261.66 272.33 B: oh yeah you know i i had to laugh because it drives my husband absolutely bonkers i don't make the bed and i don't put my clothes in the laundry hamper 

268.64 271.66 A: [laughter] 

271.73 274.79 A: [laughter] 

273.11 278.08 B: and he is a perfectionist and he gets up and makes the bed in the morning 

274.82 276.34 A: oh 

278.41 282.92 B: and we came to the conclusion that we had to agree 

283.04 287.17 B: that it's not important to me but it's important to him 

286.44 287.86 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

287.50 289.91 B: therefore he will do it 

289.61 294.31 A: [laughter] okay he was all right with that 

292.21 302.21 B: and yeah i mean like why are you going to fold your clothes so that you can just pull them out of your drawers to wear them again that doesn't make any sense to me 

299.74 306.66 A: (( [laughter] )) 

302.61 307.91 B: (( just put 'em in a basket it drives him bonkers he hates it )) 

306.74 308.61 A: [laughter] 

308.07 313.93 B: i said i don't mind so if you have a problem with it then you fold the clothes [laughter] 

311.47 315.21 A: [laughter] 

314.43 322.46 B: although now we have children so now they fold the clothes [laughter] 

317.32 319.81 A: oh no [laughter] 

321.26 323.77 A: i have a friend though that uh [mn] 

326.01 333.60 A: always you know laugh at her 'cause like you know i just you know it really actually it really gets to me because she doesn't fold the socks 

334.16 334.96 B: (( uh-huh )) 

334.90 336.63 A: and i said how can you 

336.82 339.98 A: spend all your life looking for socks every morning 

339.94 341.68 B: [laughter] 

340.29 345.07 A: if you would just fold 'em up when you wash them then you would know where they were at you know and uh 

344.94 347.95 B: well that's because they never get washed in the same load 

347.35 356.11 A: [laughter] now see that is a big thing to me now it's funny what's big to people 

348.43 351.10 B: [laughter] 

356.02 357.76 B: (( it is )) 

356.70 360.26 A: you know and what's that you know is important to one person is not to the other 

360.49 364.27 A: and so i guess in a relationship then you have to be able to compromise you know 

363.95 365.80 B: yeah 

364.55 368.79 A: you gotta recognize that so- you're gonna have differences you know and uh 

368.39 374.80 B: yeah and i think looking at um health backgrounds 

373.47 375.10 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

375.03 380.09 B: and being prepared for what might be in the future health wise 

378.99 380.33 A: (( oh )) 

380.16 386.13 B: because we didn't know this when we got married but my husband has a very rare disease 

385.50 386.80 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

386.32 395.25 B: and it is a mother pass down so had he been the wife and i been the husband and we had children together our children would have had the disease 

395.34 396.93 A: oh wow 

395.68 404.61 B: and so that is something that um i think that life partners need to look at and discuss whether or not 

405.60 418.50 B: they are are um aware of anything and what happens if that emergency happens and you end up you know taking care of that person or ch- changing their bedpan are you ready for that type of a commitment 

418.28 420.37 A: that's true that's true 

419.27 420.36 B: (( you know )) 

420.69 423.75 B: so that's you know that's something we've had 

423.79 433.07 B: come to our realization in the last year is that with his disease he's had three major strokes and he's only thirty seven 

432.78 434.29 A: oh my goodness 

433.68 437.88 B: and so i've had to you know take care [laughter] of him in that way 

436.68 438.17 A: yeah 

438.10 442.72 B: and um you know it's a matter of do you love them enough to 

443.03 446.22 B: [sigh] to commit to them to that level of commitment 

446.00 449.12 A: yeah but you know that's something that you would 

446.79 447.86 B: you know 

449.73 452.63 A: i mean that's rare that people 

451.55 453.31 B: yeah 

453.02 462.91 A: you kinda assume it i guess you know you know for better or for worse but [mn] you know i guess you don't i guess you gotta think about what's the worst 

461.94 464.76 B: yeah and people don't like to think that way 

464.12 466.89 A: no uh-uh uh-uh they don't they don't 

466.26 476.40 B: h- here in america we're like no we are perfect you know life is perfect our world is perfect and nothing will ever happen to me [laughter] 

474.55 476.33 A: no and that's that's true 

477.67 481.68 B: so yeah you know for us it was a real eye opener 

482.26 485.99 B: but it definitely helps us commit more to each other it would have b- 

484.94 486.88 A: and i think that's great you know 

486.19 489.52 B: it could've either have destroyed our relationship completely or 

489.87 495.70 B: bonded it completely and for us it it seems to have bonded our relationship 

494.56 501.48 A: oh i think that is great i think that is great then there was something else i was thinking about you know 

496.20 497.82 B: it is 

500.71 502.14 B: [sigh] oh sorry [laughter] 

501.54 503.80 A: well you know actually it's um 

504.11 507.92 A: when you know you're talking about diseases and all like that i think uh 

508.25 509.32 A: people 

509.66 516.68 A: you know i'm i'm a nurse and i work in an emergency room and i see a lot of different things that come through that had the people 

517.74 521.20 A: you know they knew they had it in their families but they never 

521.57 531.03 A: they didn't think before they especially they didn't think before they started having children so they're passing down these weird diseases to the children that they knew ran in their family but they never 

522.82 524.58 B: yeah 

527.35 529.27 B: yeah 

531.60 539.90 A: thought about okay now i need to find out you know get some genetic counseling here found out what it is that you know we can have and all like that you know 

535.02 536.89 B: yeah 

540.00 550.01 B: well this one is called melas m. e. l. a. s. it's mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis stroke and stroke like syndrome 

549.72 551.75 A: oh my goodness [laughter] 

551.09 554.62 B: and [laughter] and i'm not a medical professional 

554.20 559.90 A: [laughter] you got that down right though boy you really said it [laughter] that's good 

555.58 559.25 B: [laughter] i've been 

559.11 572.39 B: i've been asked if i wanna become a neurologist [laughter] by a major neurologist over here in california she's uh one of the teachers up at stanford and she's like have you ever thought about going into medical school 

561.15 562.75 A: [laughter] 

565.95 566.86 A: uh-huh 

571.85 574.22 A: [laughter] 

573.16 583.96 B: but um if you wanna research it that's what it is it's melas and um it's a very interesting disease because it attacks the energy producing parts of the cell 

583.90 585.44 A: [noise] oh wow 

584.37 591.65 B: and um he gets seizures migraines strokes kidney failure heart failure diabetes all that
