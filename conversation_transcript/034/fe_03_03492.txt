56.18 61.84 B: like what do you look for that wills you know what qualities do you look for that will 

61.70 72.22 A: probably i would say it would be a good idea if we can start out with that because you're already married and you do have a life partner like for very long time i guess 

62.00 63.02 B: you think 

71.80 73.16 B: mhm 

73.03 76.39 A: so i guess it's it's good if you can start on this 

76.21 77.63 B: mhm 

76.82 79.32 A: without then expecting a person who's single 

79.97 81.11 A: right 

80.41 81.73 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

81.91 83.01 B: yeah 

82.98 85.04 A: w- what do you say about the 

84.64 87.97 B: well i i i say um 

87.98 95.74 B: one of the qualities is i guess compromising a couple needs to like learn how to compromise in lots of situations 

95.66 96.57 A: mhm 

95.87 107.40 B: to have a lasting relationship and i guess how each other argues and um like not calling names and stuff and and compromise i will say 

99.17 99.94 A: mhm 

107.57 108.52 A: mhm 

107.65 110.71 B: is a quality you know 

109.79 118.68 A: yeah i guess yeah that's yeah that's a key thing i think in the relationship to continue for life long 

118.27 119.33 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

118.92 126.83 A: especially when you're looking for a life partner you know you're looking for someone who's gonna be who's gonna spend the rest of the life with you 

127.10 131.38 A: so the person should be like very much understanding 

131.21 132.43 B: yeah 

132.08 141.14 A: i mean the arguments keep coming every other day you know or one of the other reason but someone needs to compromise in the relation relationship 

135.83 137.03 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

139.96 142.35 B: exactly yeah i 

141.43 147.04 A: (( you both keep on going on arguing about things or whatever for the for the matter so )) 

146.69 147.94 B: mhm 

147.53 150.08 A: (( things never gonna gonna settle down )) 

149.81 151.18 B: right 

150.64 158.10 A: so you know someone needs to compromise and then oh then you have take the person as your life partner 

153.52 154.48 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

158.48 163.08 A: the person is gonna be there for the rest of your life if you like so 

161.61 166.84 B: yeah i agree and also i think you know it's really how 

167.11 174.03 B: how people talk to each other and how they relate to each other that makes a big difference you know 

171.96 173.10 A: yeah 

174.05 175.28 A: mhm 

174.63 179.40 B: and then uh especially when there are kids involved too because uh um 

180.12 185.31 B: that that itself you know uh causes a lot of uh stress 

185.52 191.08 B: and yeah and how the couple deals with that you know also makes a big difference 

185.72 186.95 A: yeah 

189.61 190.57 A: (( mhm )) 

191.09 192.15 B: yeah 

191.99 196.99 A: but when naturally the kids come like cannot there be more responsibility on 

196.06 197.17 B: yes 

197.21 202.39 A: both of them to take care of them and lot of other things that come up 

202.64 214.64 A: so i mean actually i'm uh i'm totally inexperienced in this i'm still single so i'm yeah yeah but still like you know i'm twenty five years old and i'm a master student in a university 

207.31 209.18 B: mhm you're single right 

214.00 215.51 B: (( mhm where you from )) 

216.18 218.01 B: you have an accent where you from 

216.23 217.11 A: oh 

218.18 220.88 A: (( oh initially i'm from india actually i'm not )) 

219.67 227.22 B: oh you're from india okay so you're so your culture um you're from a culture with traditional family 

221.02 222.37 A: yeah 

226.87 231.67 A: yeah very much yeah very much very much from that side 

227.31 228.71 B: background 

229.63 230.71 B: yeah 

231.11 233.14 B: yeah well that's good then 

233.27 239.32 A: yeah but i i'm here only for studies like i just came over a year like a year and a half past 

233.28 234.38 B: yeah 

238.59 240.01 B: yeah 

239.53 248.68 A: oh i'm doing my masters so but then you know our culture is totally different like you know once you pick a life partner 

245.82 246.90 B: yeah 

248.90 263.16 A: it does go and take on for the whole of life but then whatever be the case the key things over here is like you know it they both should be very understanding and as you said like the compromising is the key thing over there 

251.98 252.98 B: (( yeah mhm mhm mhm )) 

263.14 268.60 A: oh there be lot of things which keeps coming especially when the kids come up like you know 

268.70 273.39 A: or there might be arguments or the excuse for every other thing 

272.89 278.12 B: yeah well your culture is uh very family oriented right 

274.09 274.95 A: so 

277.96 280.62 A: yeah very much very much yeah 

278.82 282.98 B: yeah so that that that's a good start [laughter] 

283.05 284.18 B: right 

283.39 284.96 A: (( yeah )) 

285.09 296.58 A: even the family support is a very key thing like you know in our in our side what happens is when something happens within you and uh your life partner i mean your spouse 

287.55 289.44 B: exactly yeah 

296.17 297.36 B: mhm 

296.78 302.41 A: (( so virtually in our in our culture like the family will be altogether )) 

302.41 311.17 A: so even if you don't compromise there will be one of other elderly person who would jump into the issue and you know they they get people together and you know 

306.61 307.75 B: mhm 

310.90 312.22 B: yeah that's true 

311.12 315.81 A: or they try to make them understand and tell them okay this is where some 

315.77 326.72 A: mistakes have happened or something and then everything would be all right again so that's it we have that uh extra thing over there the family supported you over there 

317.91 318.95 B: mhm 

321.81 322.61 B: yeah 

326.43 327.57 B: yeah 

326.98 329.31 A: (( or i mean )) 

330.81 331.92 A: (( over here )) 

331.87 335.79 B: mhm are your families here in the states or are they in india 

335.00 338.02 A: no i came all by myself over here 

337.27 338.71 B: oh okay 

338.06 342.68 A: but they are back home in india i just came over here for my study 

339.99 340.82 B: oh 

341.96 350.77 B: oh okay like do you plan to go back to india to get married you know find a a a girlfriend and then get married there or you plan to uh 

351.04 357.51 A: well actually uh i'm not keen on uh those things as of now 

351.10 352.68 B: do so in the states 

357.16 358.20 B: mhm 

357.75 362.95 A: the thing is though it yeah it will take one more year for me to finish my studies over here 

358.22 359.20 B: (( oh yeah you're )) 

362.11 363.91 B: oh what is your major 

363.92 365.41 A: uh computer science 

365.07 367.47 B: oh okay that's good 

366.60 380.32 A: oh so probably i'll be looking for some kind of software job over here so if i do get settled over here i may have to find somebody over yeah i mean we have lots of indians over here too so i can always find somebody over here 

370.45 372.20 B: yeah yeah 

379.91 381.05 B: mhm 

380.48 385.89 A: (( otherwise i can always go back home and then like i can get married and settle down over there )) 

385.45 388.48 B: yeah well in your culture like um 

388.59 395.73 B: like do you does your family do they fix the marriage for you or you could pick your own mate 

393.85 395.07 A: (( yeah )) 

395.41 401.94 A: (( yeah most of the time that is the case like you know the family they go out and look for the person )) 

399.46 400.58 B: yeah 

401.71 402.64 B: uh-huh 

402.02 408.79 A: and you you even you to get talk to the person before like you know or getting in and uh 

406.64 414.46 B: okay that's interesting 'cause i'm always wondering like how does it usually work out in this situation 

414.61 415.45 A: uh-huh 

415.20 417.18 B: does it usually work out 

417.42 420.08 B: you know when your family pick the mate 

419.56 420.48 A: okay 

420.46 421.70 B: does it um 

421.41 425.38 A: i mean so far that's how the things used to work out 

424.73 425.68 B: mhm 

425.44 430.08 A: (( like you know till at least like uh the middle nineties that was )) 

429.89 437.49 A: (( uh most uh ninety percent of the marriages used to take place like that the families they go out and look for a person and then )) 

433.77 434.73 B: (( oh )) 

436.55 437.87 B: yeah 

437.27 451.29 A: they let you know and you get to talk to the person and then only that things work out but nowadays things are changing slowly over there too like the first son whoever is getting married they go out first looking and then they'll inform the family 

444.49 445.67 B: mhm oh okay 

450.97 452.24 B: mhm 

451.64 456.51 A: so things are changing little by little i mean the new generation is coming up and 

455.71 456.74 B: right 

456.40 466.69 A: (( all these things are happening but still like seventy eighty percent of the marriages in india uh are again like you know it's all done by the family i mean they go out look for )) 

460.78 461.78 B: mhm 

466.60 467.73 B: yeah 

467.19 474.48 A: (( the person be first the family family interaction and only then the people who are getting married they get to talk to each other )) 

474.45 475.60 B: oh okay 

474.77 478.56 A: get to know each other before like getting married or something 

478.10 488.65 B: oh well you know it well when the family picks they would pick someone that they feel is right for the whole family you know that would blend with the family 

482.67 483.50 A: mhm 

488.50 489.45 A: yeah 

488.68 492.95 B: right so um they're more careful in that regard 

489.92 490.81 A: yeah 

493.30 496.79 B: you know i could yeah i could see that that could work out 

497.06 507.29 A: (( yeah actually that's where th- that's the only place where you know it might be tough for the person who's getting married to get to know the uh i mean it's not our life partner you know )) 

502.80 503.78 B: yeah 

506.89 507.87 B: (( right mhm )) 

507.26 516.40 A: or i mean you know the family picks they're allowed to they won't have much time to talk to the person get to know them what exactly they're looking for 

516.40 525.74 A: and all but that's one tough thing but usually sometimes you know because of some kind of compromise or something they gradually get settled down 

523.15 524.15 B: yeah 

525.49 526.47 B: (( right oh )) 

525.80 538.24 A: (( but otherwise actually even i don't see that uh i yeah a very good one because you know family they just go out and look and then finally they'll tell you like this is the person we're seeing you go out and talk )) 

538.40 542.47 A: (( so it's gonna be tough for things to work out that way )) 

542.20 543.51 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

542.93 552.98 A: so actually i'm in that way i do find the ideal over here in here's pretty much good but you go out and look pick the right person 

552.79 554.11 B: mhm 

553.52 557.84 A: and then like you know only then you go for the marriage and all this thing 

557.28 559.61 B: oh okay well that's interesting 

559.76 561.44 A: yeah 

559.87 566.63 B: i mean usually like they would pick someone that that they know right in the community 

565.31 571.86 A: (( yeah usually usually from the uh one of of their family friends about whom they know something )) 

569.51 570.91 B: oh one of family 

571.43 572.30 B: uh-huh 

571.76 580.62 A: (( uh ideally too would know their background the person's background and their family background only then they'd go higher and like you know work out things )) 

574.94 576.21 B: yeah 

580.54 586.95 A: they just can't they just won't go out and pick somebody and tell you like you know this is the person we have picked go out 

585.68 595.67 B: so you would feel so you would feel okay if you know to to have your family pick someone for you would you feel okay about it since you're educated 

594.10 599.89 A: probably probably probably i would i would prefer to pick myself uh 

598.31 599.95 B: oh okay
