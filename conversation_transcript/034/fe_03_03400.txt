250.87 259.80 A: that's a good way to look it with wearing a pair of shoes like you they're more broken in that's why the more time you spend with a person the more broken in you are to their needs and your needs 

259.56 262.30 B: yes yes it's absolutely true 

264.89 266.62 A: well we got a really uh 

266.84 271.85 A: a good question today uh i had one before and it was about terro- terrorism

313.82 315.37 A: yeah um [lipsmack] 

316.10 328.10 A: let's see i'm trying to think of anything else we could talk about of a life partner oh maybe um closer to your age would be something too to look for you know having a finding a partner that's close to your age 

319.54 320.56 B: [laughter] 

328.28 329.54 B: (( mm uh )) 

328.88 331.88 A: not really much older but not too younger 

331.30 340.78 B: i think uh i've sort of found a a life partner who is much older than me because i feel that he's more mature 

340.93 341.91 A: yeah 

341.41 349.68 B: but [mn] but i i last i um my current boyfriend is only three three years 

349.80 355.68 B: older than me i i still feel that's not enough because sometimes he's 

351.58 352.29 A: oh 

355.75 358.12 B: um he's not mature enough 

355.83 356.60 A: (( [laughter] )) 

358.10 359.23 A: right 

359.43 366.49 B: i hope that um my life partner can be about eight to ten years older than me 

366.59 367.98 A: yeah 

366.85 368.32 B: what do you think of it 

369.03 369.91 A: um 

370.58 384.99 A: i don't know i look for um i'm married so it's hard to talk about picking a life partner but uh my husband is just a year older than me i do believe uh maybe older is better having a little bit older of the male but it just depends i guess on 

384.87 386.60 A: you know the couple it 

386.13 387.08 B: uh-huh 

387.04 392.45 A: depends on the male and the female and i guess it could go either way [laughter] 

390.72 396.14 B: mhm but i i definitely would not fall in love with uh 

395.93 406.57 B: um with a boy who is younger than me i think i think in that way i i cannot accept like that but but maybe there will be some ex- 

398.74 399.75 A: right 

401.06 401.78 A: right 

406.90 409.54 B: uh exception who knows mhm mhm 

408.95 410.73 A: right yeah 

410.94 415.61 A: yeah that's the way i feel too i wouldn't really look for somebody any younger but you know there 

416.89 418.72 A: there can be exceptions 

418.12 426.66 B: yeah mm yeah and maybe maybe you know um maybe he's he's mature at heart but he looks younger 

425.30 426.19 A: right 

426.78 427.69 B: um 

427.04 428.08 A: yeah 

427.77 429.11 B: yeah who knows [mn]

446.52 447.63 A: okay 

448.17 451.64 B: um maybe we have to talk about ten minutes right 

451.55 453.85 A: right [noise] 

451.98 457.51 B: maybe we can talk about um um divorce 

458.14 459.22 A: yeah 

459.61 462.40 B: maybe we can talk about whether we we have

484.23 485.25 B: (( um )) 

485.77 488.68 B: is that i i pretty doubt about that 

486.68 491.42 A: (( [noise] yeah huh )) 

493.04 493.76 B: (( i )) 

496.34 502.42 B: i pretty doubt uh doubt um um uh whether love can be forever 

502.56 504.90 B: because i think that 

504.92 510.60 B: um the view the views of people will change with the time 

511.67 515.97 B: so i doubt i doubt whether love could be forever 

516.96 517.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

519.30 521.78 B: (( because uh personally i )) 

521.79 524.84 B: sometimes i will change change my 

525.06 527.82 B: change my views with time pass by

543.36 543.93 A: (( yeah )) 

544.62 551.10 B: love start to be together because they love each other but later they may be they they 

546.78 547.47 A: (( [noise] )) 

548.25 549.16 A: yeah 

551.38 554.34 B: live together because it's a habit 

554.38 556.18 B: they feel more comfortable mhm 

555.38 557.60 A: (( [mn] )) 

558.00 565.57 A: well it all depends too on raising a family if you're raising a family that that could change your ideals on that too 

565.39 579.36 B: oh yeah yeah you know uh children can can make can link the family can link the people i think if if we have children everything probably can change 

580.04 582.18 A: yeah 

585.22 587.74 A: over time you can never tell [laughter] 

587.36 588.61 B: mhm
