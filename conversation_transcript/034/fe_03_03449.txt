1.00 3.12 B: hello my name is michelle 

2.73 4.94 A: hi michelle my name is barb 

5.15 6.25 B: hi barb 

9.81 15.41 A: well um what do you think is the most important thing to look for in a life partner i'm assuming you're married 

15.37 16.58 B: i am 

16.76 22.28 B: um i think it's someone that's very reliable as far as that you can trust them 

22.48 23.65 B: um 

24.09 32.54 B: you know trust them with anything and everything you can talk to them or you can trust that they're gonna be somewhere when they say or do what they say [sigh] um 

34.03 36.20 B: (( i don't know [laughter] )) 

35.34 43.52 A: okay [laughter] well actually you you uh are saying that and i guess the one term that came to my mind was honesty reliable is actually a better term because 

43.62 44.63 A: um 

45.43 54.25 A: your reliable hit it when you said trust what they say and and you know um and trust they're gonna do what they say they're gonna do 'cause honesty i think to me is the most important thing 

54.44 59.48 A: [lipsmack] because if they're honest we're not playing games and and if they're honest with themselves and with you 

59.51 65.86 A: you can pretty much get through about anything that comes along it's it's when people try to make you happy 

66.05 68.49 A: by saying what they think you want to hear 

68.71 71.54 A: and they're being dishonest is i think to me that's the 

71.89 77.97 A: that's the bad one in but you y- y- your your term reliable really i i guess i hadn't thought of that but that uh 

78.08 79.64 A: that grabs it all 

79.69 80.49 A: that's 

80.96 86.03 A: we got ten minutes so we can't stop there [laughter] have you been married before michelle 

83.27 85.06 B: [laughter] 

86.33 88.21 B: no this is my first marriage 

87.73 89.61 A: and how long have you been married this time 

89.24 93.50 B: um we have been married six and a half years 

92.76 95.32 A: cool so you're getting ready for the seven year itch 

95.26 102.25 B: yeah [laughter] i have it's terrible [laughter] 

96.11 99.55 A: [laughter] you probably heard nightmares about that 

100.45 104.19 A: oh it'll be fine and do you have a reliable spouse now 

103.96 105.09 B: yes 

104.64 107.47 A: okay well then you'll be fine you'll be just fine mm 

106.02 111.00 B: yeah i'm not i'm not worried about anything [laughter] i don't think [laughter] 

110.58 114.69 A: well that's part of that that's part of it right there are you as reliable as he is 

114.81 118.10 B: definitely yeah oh yeah 

115.67 116.81 A: good 

117.02 119.47 A: sounds like maybe more so [laughter] 

118.55 121.98 B: i think i am more so [laughter] 

119.53 122.90 A: [laughter] i shouldn't have said that do you have children 

123.02 127.62 B: i have two i have um two boys a four year old and an eight month old 

127.33 131.59 A: oh my a new mommy okay cool cool 

129.41 133.04 B: yeah yeah it's been great how 'bout you 

132.83 139.55 A: well i uh i guess i guess [sigh] one could actually say i'm speaking from experience because i am on my uh 

141.17 142.39 A: fourth marriage 

142.24 143.40 B: wow 

143.82 144.88 A: um 

145.37 155.15 A: and actually the first one it wasn't a matter of either one of us not being reliable and honest actually we were uh so that sort of dispeat- disputes the theory that um you and i have 

155.20 157.42 A: um we were just friends 

157.71 168.41 A: and that's all there was there was no chemistry and we were just friends and we could've gone on being friends forever but it just wasn't enough we were really never unhappy but we were really never happy 

168.53 176.20 A: um we're to this day very good friends and are there for each other we have a child together and we share in that child 

168.55 169.51 B: right 

176.25 179.51 A: um but we're just friends and uh 

179.59 187.04 A: so therefore we sort of agreed to go our separate ways and then [sigh] the second marriage was a matter of dishonesty and unreliability [lipsmack] 

187.58 202.42 A: and then the third one was an abusive alcoholic situation so i have an honest reliable [laughter] individual who doesn't drink and and there's more there than just you know there's chemistry we're good friends but there's also [sigh] so i guess that sort of um 

194.67 196.48 B: [laughter] 

202.45 207.61 A: i sort of destroyed what we said didn't i by saying honesty was honesty i think is the most important 

205.38 214.63 B: well i'm sure you i'm sure from each relationship you learned something you didn't want and what you did want you know what i'm saying you learn like both things what what to look for 

209.46 210.54 A: mm well 

211.87 212.74 A: right 

213.05 214.22 A: yeah well 

214.69 224.88 A: you're right michelle 'cause actually this is tom's fourth marriage too [laughter] so we really think we've got it this time and truthfully if you get back to the honesty bit if we had both been honest with my first marriage 

225.05 232.24 A: then we wouldn't have gotten married 'cause neither we both sorta knew that we were best friends our families were what are you doing 

232.14 236.54 A: they you know they knew that we didn't love love each other but we thought we would grow to 

236.43 250.81 A: but we were deceiving ourselves so if we'd both been very honest then that marriage probably wouldn't have happened so reliability honesty i guess but you have to i guess rely honesty starts at home you have to be that way with yourself before you can be with someone else 

250.59 252.60 B: i i totally agree with that 

252.79 256.77 B: i really do we were we we were only together 

257.13 262.05 B: [lipsmack] well we were together se- what was it uh fifteen months i think when we got married 

261.70 263.33 A: oh wow so that 

262.49 272.70 B: yeah he he was in such a rush [laughter] to be honest i'm four years older than him and he was only twenty one when we got married he was in such a rush and i was twenty five 

264.59 266.07 A: [laughter] 

267.43 268.62 A: oh okay 

270.89 271.76 A: uh-huh 

272.59 274.13 A: but you were okay with it 

274.89 281.81 B: [lipsmack] um i really wanted to wait longer i had been engaged prior to i had been engaged and then separated from 

278.45 279.27 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

280.48 282.55 A: but this was a first marriage for both of you 

282.18 292.06 B: yes yeah i didn't go through with the marriage with the other person he just he actually became abusive [sigh] and yeah during the engagement and i just wouldn't 

282.68 283.71 A: oh okay 

288.26 290.52 A: wow good for you 

292.07 298.69 B: well my mother had been in an abusive relationship and i swore i would never allow [laughter] myself to be put in that position so i walked away 

295.24 296.57 A: (( n- no )) 

296.67 297.55 A: no 

298.39 299.52 A: good for you 

299.29 300.54 B: and um 

300.58 304.87 B: it's probably one of the best things i've ever done for myself [laughter] but um 

304.10 305.24 A: and for him 

305.44 308.26 B: yeah and for him 'cause i think i mean 

307.31 312.07 A: probably a wake up call for him to get [laughter] to get dumped that close to getting married though 

311.51 315.78 B: yeah and you know it's kind of strange because he was a very um 

315.85 317.83 B: [lipsmack] he was into you know he'd he'd 

317.87 323.48 B: he went to to college for psychology and all of that i mean he but he never like saw anything in himself 

323.18 327.61 A: oh cool but you know they say the mechanic's car never runs you 

323.89 325.32 B: it was really weird 

328.16 329.49 A: heard that old term 

328.63 332.32 B: oh actually i never heard that before but that that's such a good 

330.41 339.21 A: oh my dad was a mechanic and our cars my gosh my mom was always calling him and he'd have to come jump her or he'd have to put on a tire because he would he would run 'em till they were bald 

339.28 345.98 A: because he never had time to work on his own car and he never saw that as a priority because he everybody else's car had to be fixed you know 

345.77 360.16 A: the mayor of our town there was never anything wrong with his car his wife's car never had to be jumped never had any problems carburetor was always idling just fine back when they had carburetors that idled okay they had to be idled just fine my mother's car was never dependable and it's because 

354.61 356.11 B: mhm 

360.56 371.75 A: we put you know most people like that professionals or psychology doctors nurses they tend to put themselves last and they solve the problems of all the world and they forget that they haven't solved the problem at home 

372.42 378.32 A: so maybe maybe your leaving him woke him up and he started using his psychology for himself hopefully 

377.79 380.84 B: i hope so i heard he's been married since but i 

380.86 382.93 B: haven't really kept up on him so 

383.04 391.28 B: he he he would continue to pursue me every couple of months and then [cough] as soon as he found out i was with chris my husband chris don't know why my voice is going all of a sudden 

386.30 387.53 A: (( mm oh )) 

391.35 392.91 B: (( um [cough] )) 

393.88 398.55 B: when he found out chris and i were together he actually knew my husband's brother 

398.34 399.88 A: (( mm okay )) 

398.99 403.15 B: and he kept harassing me and harassing me and then when he the one day he 

403.43 407.90 B: came into this bar that i was in and chris and i had just come back from vacation that day 

407.57 408.41 A: uh-huh 

407.95 412.92 B: and he was telling my husband's brother how he had just oh i found out michelle has a new boyfriend blah blah blah 

413.03 414.28 B: and uh 

414.57 416.40 B: next thing you know you know 

416.54 423.72 B: ch- my brother in law chip is and and he's oh yes it's my brother and he introduced him and everything and i have never heard from this guy since 

419.52 421.22 A: (( mhm oh man )) 

423.39 425.88 A: well good good 

424.23 427.61 B: so i don't know if it was just 'cause he had been friends with chip 

426.10 438.51 A: maybe he had a respect enough or maybe he just knew that you know okay if you're if you're with this guy's brother he might get his clock cleaned [laughter] maybe he realized that he was taking on more than he could chew and maybe it wasn't wor- you know maybe he actually just realized 

432.38 433.79 B: [laughter] yeah 

438.28 442.82 A: with a lot of people i i know just from having been there and and then with other people 

442.91 443.83 A: um 

443.75 452.64 A: a lot of times a divorce isn't really final or the breakup of the relationship isn't really final until one or the other really does move on and then the other one can let go a little better 

452.54 460.77 A: otherwise they always hang in there it's like my ex husband did that he didn't date anyone and and you know until i started moving on with my life 

460.78 462.89 A: and then when he saw that i was serious 

462.68 476.65 A: then you know what there was nothing left for him to do i mean he needed to get on with his life it was kinda like that gives them permission to move on otherwise they can't admit that it's over they won't admit that they've failed or the relationship failed men have a harder time with that than women do it seems 

476.83 486.60 A: i mean most of the time women can say next but men are just like no no they just have like i don't know they just hang on to this fantasy [laughter] of she'll take me back she'll never do better [laughter] 

484.01 487.99 B: yeah you know that i think that's true too 

488.07 495.99 B: because um you know even like if my whenever my husband and i have had difficulties or something and then at one point we had a lot of problems after our first child and 

496.13 508.45 B: and i had said you know maybe we should just go our separate ways and i was ready to and he could see he you know he could see i was ready to just say i can't do this any more you know and i had swore i would never get divorced 'cause my parents were divorced and 

508.74 510.35 B: i said i would never do it 

510.31 525.08 B: and i literally just like didn't talk to him i just was like okay whatever you know you wanna you wanna go out till four in the morning see ya go ahead no problem and i n- wouldn't say anything i wouldn't complain about anything i think he realized that i was gonna walk away from the relationship and he actually 

517.84 518.77 A: (( mm mhm uh-huh )) 

525.13 527.72 A: it turned him around yeah 

526.00 532.36 B: it turned him around because he came running back he was like oh i don't want you to leave and and every once in a while he'll pull something 

532.43 540.37 B: and he'll you know i'll i'll just start to pull away from him and he'll see it and he'll be like oh no no no [laughter] you know 

538.69 545.28 A: mhm well it's what i have found and i you know the benefits of all these many [laughter] relationships what i have found is that 

545.39 559.87 A: they really they want you to be a doormat but they don't want you to be a doormat and the minute you start standing up to them it's like they respect you all over again not only do they realize what they have to lose but they realize that you know hey she's just really not gonna let me walk all over her it's like something about the man they like to hunt 

552.09 553.71 B: mhm 

559.81 567.77 A: but you gotta keep the hunt going because it's gotta you know they need that they it's kinda like they want to be needed but yet 

567.86 582.11 A: they also know they want to know that you will go on that you need 'em to a certain point but yet you know honey there's uh there there's more people out there and i don't you know the children and i will be fine you wanna be a jerk you go right on and be a jerk but you're not doing it on my time 

582.25 594.82 A: and they sorta wake up luckily you know [laughter] i guess she doesn't need me as much as i thought she needed me i better make and so then it's kinda like now that you say you you you in a way not said it but you've shown you know i i i will live my life without you 

594.70 595.86 B: right 

594.95 599.90 A: it makes them chase you they want you back because i mean he probably really never wanted
