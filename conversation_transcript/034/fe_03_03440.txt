472.11 474.37 B: yeah yeah yeah 

472.90 473.66 A: i'm 

473.90 477.33 A: [mn] [mn] i'm just completely just me i don't have anything to say here 

477.79 484.76 B: well i say i mean like if you if you see that woman you know you hit on her i mean what's after that is it just you know for 

485.82 490.54 A: um riding bicycles going off to a movie um going to dinner 

490.58 497.36 A: um going out and about watching meteors in the convertible i mean the world's full of neat things that are more fun shared 

496.99 503.19 B: yeah so i mean is it just is it like just with friends or is it just for you know one person for a date or two and then 

497.99 499.40 A: but um

507.54 509.21 A: being like in my life 

510.09 513.83 A: yeah i just i couldn't i don't think i'd take to that very well at all 

513.97 514.74 B: (( hm )) 

516.52 518.27 B: wh- why is that do you think 

518.05 519.11 A: um

524.67 526.40 B: yeah 

527.07 529.14 B: would you i mean do you go 

527.92 534.79 A: but if you're in but you know i've seen people who are in love and they're just you know none of those things matter i mean just you have to be with this person 

534.50 536.30 B: yeah 

536.14 541.95 A: and and we're beyond rational things i mean i could no longer do it than you could not do it i mean it's it's right for you 

542.06 542.91 B: yeah 

542.22 549.96 A: and you're in the realm of belief and not thought you don't make yourself think or change the way you think you just do because you're in the realm of belief 

550.75 554.39 A: and there are areas of belief that people cannot change their mind 

554.96 559.25 A: um religion's that way people either are religious or they're not and they don't change 

559.36 560.88 A: or very rarely change 

561.03 562.95 B: yeah they do they do change 

562.94 567.82 A: yeah very rarely but you can't make yourself you either you either believe yourself 

563.05 563.80 B: but 

566.97 568.75 B: yeah 

568.30 571.01 A: and the realm of belief is different than the realm of knowledge 

572.40 575.45 A: you know you can learn things but you can't learn to believe things 

576.18 578.44 A: you believe or you don't 

577.63 579.44 B: yeah 

580.49 583.51 B: or something has to happen to change that belief 

582.61 588.72 A: yeah that [mn] yeah if there was something cathartic to change you but it's not on purpose you don't make yourself change 

588.44 590.18 B: yeah 

589.10 591.07 A: the way you make yourself learn things 

591.40 594.29 A: you know if you need to know how to do something you can learn it 

594.21 595.28 B: right 

594.60 597.92 A: (( i'm a i'm a [mn] not formally educated person )) 

598.00 599.89 A: so if i need to learn something i can go to a
