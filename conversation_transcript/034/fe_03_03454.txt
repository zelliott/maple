5.46 7.07 A: i'm doing okay 

6.86 8.88 B: alice right 

7.97 10.06 A: right [noise] 

9.76 10.65 B: so 

10.69 11.58 B: some 

11.61 14.90 B: quality in our life partner i think that's what the question was 

14.15 19.06 A: the most important quality [laughter] 

15.22 16.90 B: (( important ooh )) 

17.32 19.55 B: [laughter] um 

19.66 21.39 B: well [sigh] 

21.79 24.29 B: i don't know let's see that's a tough one 

24.96 26.75 A: i'm gonna say trust 

25.09 25.83 B: um 

26.67 28.06 B: trust 

27.47 32.31 A: mhm i think you've gotta have total trust in a life partner or you can't you know 

28.46 29.56 B: yeah 

32.49 33.96 B: yeah that's true 

32.88 38.78 A: it's the basis of a lot of things [laughter] you know money and 

35.66 38.15 B: absolutely of a good relationship mhm 

39.18 41.36 A: just you know everything [cough] 

42.38 43.52 B: (( no you're right )) 

43.62 47.44 B: and then once that trust is broken it's very difficult to regain too 

47.26 48.19 A: right 

47.94 50.15 B: so yeah it is very important 

49.70 51.11 A: right it is 

50.36 51.76 B: (( um i )) 

51.80 56.46 B: don't know i think i think having a good listener for a partner is also very important 

56.24 57.05 A: yeah 

56.73 58.02 B: someone who 

57.82 59.61 A: communication yeah 

59.00 63.18 B: yeah yeah yeah not just like hears you but like really is listening 

60.20 60.92 A: yeah 

62.88 69.73 A: right like you don't have to say three times did you hear what i said [laughter] 

63.89 64.69 B: and 

66.63 71.10 B: right [laughter] right and if it's like a deeper sort of you know 

70.44 81.44 A: which i have to do sometimes which is not my husband's fault 'cause he's a little hard of hearing from working around trucks and [laughter] and and machinery all of his life so it's really not his fault but it's like [sigh] 

74.24 75.66 B: [laughter] 

81.04 83.85 B: right no the hard of hearing all that is fine 

81.59 88.46 A: you know you get a get a little short tempered at times like are you listening to me [laughter] 

86.28 100.43 B: [laughter] yeah i know i've i've i've just been married a couple of years but i find that um i really lucked out 'cause my husband like really pays attention to what i say and we try to work things out whereas i on the other hand am a really bad listener 

100.71 101.59 B: (( you know )) 

102.05 104.15 B: [lipsmack] i think it's one of the traits uh 

103.95 104.86 A: right 

104.20 108.68 B: one of my weaker traits so that's why i i don't i would have to say that's a really 

107.77 108.35 A: (( [noise] )) 

109.06 112.24 B: a very important thing for a life partner [sigh] 

112.64 114.80 A: yeah i agree it is too 

114.93 117.39 B: and i think also humor too you know 

116.91 117.47 A: (( [noise] )) 

119.05 121.43 B: someone doesn't take themselves too seriously 

121.33 122.24 A: right 

123.55 131.31 A: [noise] it's a i i don't i don't really think you can look for one put those in hold it one quick second in the on top okay 

131.79 139.08 A: i don't think you can look at you know really one quality i mean i guess maybe that's what they wanted us to stick to but it's a lot of things 

139.57 142.56 A: i don't think there's one just one in general 

140.36 152.31 B: mhm [sigh] yeah it's just it's tough to pinpoint i mean as you said trust of course that you know and [lipsmack] you know being able to communicate and then sort of being on the same wavelength of what you want in life 

148.84 149.76 A: right 

152.84 155.47 B: uh but a quality i guess is 

156.93 158.62 B: (( [sigh] yeah i don't know [lipsmack] )) 

158.99 160.96 B: i do like humor because 

161.21 164.96 B: you know of course i think i'm a very funny person ha ha [laughter] 

164.15 166.41 A: [laughter] 

165.20 167.78 B: (( and i like people to laugh at what i have to say )) 

167.97 171.29 B: 'cause i you know i've been out with guys that are just like total duds 

170.68 171.95 A: mhm 

171.37 174.31 B: and it doesn't it just doesn't jive you know 

173.71 174.61 A: right 

175.02 175.77 B: so 

176.32 178.87 A: yeah i think you're right i think it's a 

180.01 185.04 A: so i guess we're deciding humor and trust and communication and 

180.17 180.77 B: (( [lipsmack] [mn] )) 

184.43 191.19 B: communication yeah i know there's another one oh love well now that's not really a character oh honesty 

189.05 190.31 A: (( [laughter] )) 

191.67 192.80 A: right 

191.85 194.06 B: honesty's a character trait right 

193.05 194.85 A: mhm right 

194.17 196.33 B: i guess that might come with trust 

195.91 203.71 A: yeah but well kind of but kinda sorta one of those kinda sorta things kind of but not really [laughter] 

199.87 201.09 B: [laughter] 

201.62 204.41 B: you can't trust a dishonest person right 

204.56 206.87 A: so you've only been married a couple of years is 

206.44 207.92 B: that's right 

207.29 209.01 A: this is your first marriage 

208.46 209.79 B: yes
