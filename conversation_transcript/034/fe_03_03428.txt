0.04 1.96 A: hi i'm jackie 

1.39 5.17 B: hi jackie my name is liz hi how are you 

3.33 4.53 A: hi liz 

4.71 6.25 A: i'm fine thank you 

5.63 11.94 B: good um okay do you wanna start [laughter] go ahead you can start 

8.24 10.81 A: (( [laughter] uh it doesn't make any difference )) 

11.51 24.33 A: um i guess we're supposed to t- uh talk about what is great in a life partner i would say the best thing in a life partner uh would be someone that is your friend that someone that you can um 

24.37 26.61 A: just um talk to 

27.02 28.52 B: that's yeah i i 

27.69 29.33 A: is easy to talk to 

28.89 38.22 B: that's that's important um one of the qualities that i find um that i look for in in my husband is um honesty 

38.26 46.36 B: and trust um because i think every relationship whether it's your life partner or just your friends are based on trust 

46.23 53.61 A: yes but also too trust a lotta times in marriages uh people think they can trust their spouse but they can't 

52.94 54.78 B: right 

53.59 57.37 A: so i think if you have open communication is better than anything 

56.79 58.11 B: right 

57.34 63.97 A: because if there is problems in a marriage then the uh the the the partners can talk about it 

63.38 64.50 B: right 

63.82 66.24 A: and i have seen so many times where 

66.09 80.66 A: uh there's marriages that have not that the participants like one spouse would think they had a wonderful marriage and actually it wasn't that great and it was because the spouse would say i can't get my other partner to talk about the problems 

80.06 81.25 B: right 

80.80 90.39 A: so i think one of the uh you know i agree with trust but trust to me is um you have to win someone's trust you have to earn trust 

87.79 89.48 B: right 

89.48 103.60 B: right well that's where the honesty part comes in too i mean because if you if you love each other then you have to be able to have that communication like you said and and be able to work things out and and you know 

91.61 92.26 A: (( mm )) 

98.96 99.89 A: yes 

103.70 106.11 B: you have to be honest and you know 

104.87 109.54 A: yeah and i think well one thing that i think that is important is liking your spouse 

109.32 110.73 B: oh yeah 

109.46 114.31 A: you've got i do i think liking your spouse you have to like him because 

114.17 123.85 A: love is [mn] i think you're better i think you're better off if you like your spouse and then being in love because you fall in and out of love 

123.32 124.42 B: right 

123.61 136.50 A: and you have to like your spouse because um it's just like with my husband i had known him for several years before i even got interested in him and i liked him um as a person 

125.72 126.67 B: right 

136.04 137.13 B: right 

136.45 138.79 A: and stuff and uh uh 

139.07 143.59 A: i think that's what's important you know that because we like each other 

140.61 141.82 B: (( [noise] right )) 

142.98 144.04 B: right 

143.72 155.80 A: we like some of the same things in our relationship and stuff we like the same i like a lot of hobbies some of the hobbies he has i don't participate in because we have different you know um 

155.72 159.16 A: kinda hobbies but still we support each other 

156.67 159.49 B: right right 

159.59 169.93 B: right well that's good i mean you you have to be able because even though you're the same you still have to have some separate you know separation there has to be other things that you enjoy that 

167.34 168.46 A: right 

169.88 182.01 B: you know that that person doesn't have to be there all the time and you can do some things on your own and you know and still i mean you're one but you need to be separate sometimes too 

173.35 174.55 A: right 

181.42 182.42 A: right 

182.15 185.63 B: so i think you know that's important but um 

185.69 188.61 B: i don't know some of the other qualities you know i mean 

188.68 192.80 B: i know my spouse and i we you know we do enjoy a lot of the same things 

192.63 201.31 B: uh you know we love sports and all kinds of stuff like that but um you know he watches [laughter] more sports than i i do that's for sure and 

199.89 201.35 A: [laughter] 

201.13 207.75 B: that's okay you know i mean and i you know i like my romantic movies and you know so we have our you know 

205.60 211.37 A: right well i and i think another quality that's good is having a spouse that will support you 

210.91 211.92 B: right 

211.69 217.21 A: you know and having a spouse that is very supportive of whatever you do 

214.92 216.51 B: right 

216.73 218.11 B: right 

217.32 227.41 A: because if he's not supportive of whatever your career is or whatever decisions you may make with the children or whatever he he has to be supportive of you too 

226.89 237.38 B: right right and it helps if they don't work like ten trillion hours [laughter] so you have some time together too that you can spend as a family and and someone who is 

230.73 232.32 A: [laughter] 

237.24 251.02 B: dedicated to you and and wants you and you should be the same way with your spouse and and you want the best for your spouse no matter what or your life partner you know and and i think that that person should want the best for you no matter what 

246.52 247.56 A: that's true 

250.89 263.21 B: um you know and you know if you love somebody and like somebody then of course you want the best for them and and that's something i think is important also [noise] um [lipsmack] i'm trying to think of what else is 

263.38 267.64 B: good looks is good [laughter] i'm just kidding 

264.35 266.67 A: [laughter] yeah i know no 

266.64 270.50 A: i don't know i tell um i tell all i'm i'm a teacher 

270.05 271.44 B: mhm 

270.32 281.38 A: so i tell all my teacher friends that and i have one right now that is getting married and we have discussed she's engaged getting married and uh we talk about you know the things and 

277.22 279.69 B: [noise] mhm 

281.15 286.73 A: i said don't look at looks and all because by the time you get to seventy everybody looks terrible 

286.09 287.85 B: (( yep )) 

286.59 289.38 A: you know so i said the looks is very 

288.75 289.78 B: no 

289.18 292.09 A: low down on the scale 

289.91 291.81 B: mhm 

291.85 304.51 A: because i i know people that some people may not think they're the best looking people in the world but after i have met 'em their personalities just i'm just blowed over by their personalities 

298.07 299.37 B: [noise] 

300.04 301.12 B: right 

303.68 304.73 B: mhm 

304.31 313.70 A: and then other people that i have met and even students of mine uh i'm they're very very attractive but after getting to know 'em 

313.26 314.11 B: (( they )) 

313.53 319.66 A: they're not as attractive and stuff so i don't think uh i would like i'd say personality 

314.50 316.03 B: right right 

319.22 321.01 B: right 

319.54 329.14 A: you know uh i'd say uh looks of somebody for me what i did with my husband i looked for a strong individual uh and i needed a strong 

328.97 342.34 A: individual um because i have a strong personality so i needed someone that was uh 'cause i was very independent uh i got married and i needed someone that was a very strong personality very independent too 

332.12 333.48 B: right 

335.51 336.40 B: mhm 

341.63 342.58 B: right 

342.24 356.36 A: i needed someone you know the qualities i think everybody looks for different qualities in in maybe in a mate you know what i might look for might be different than what you might or someone else might look for 

349.98 351.81 B: (( right )) 

354.99 356.20 B: right 

356.35 361.52 B: right well i i also find um that well i mean for 

361.96 363.88 B: physical attraction is 

363.91 376.47 B: in most cases what attracts you to the person in the first place but like you said i mean that person could turn out to be i mean you know i've met people and they could turn out to be just not nice people um and the other thing that i find that [cough] 

367.14 368.30 A: right 

370.26 372.40 A: [laughter] 

373.34 374.22 A: yes 

376.67 389.54 B: that i like in my spouse is that the acceptance no matter what you know i mean they must husband accepts me no matter i mean i get roll out of bed and he accepts me and he still loves me and 

388.59 390.86 A: and that's the way it should be yeah 

389.56 393.93 B: right and and that's what is important that's something else that's important 

394.05 395.07 B: um 

395.25 397.28 B: because without that you know i mean 

397.46 404.56 B: you know people change and lots of things happen and you you need to be willing to accept that person 

403.85 406.14 A: yes and you need a mate that will 

406.27 418.94 A: that will accept you when you grow because how you are when you're twenty you're not you're gonna be totally different have different ideas and um values and stuff when you get to be forty than you are when you're twenty 

418.31 419.88 B: right right 

419.06 433.01 A: if if if how it's it's different because you the older you get things a lotta times will change things that you thought were important when you were eighteen twenty you find out when you get to be forty or so it's not important anymore 

432.34 433.37 B: (( [noise] right )) 

433.23 438.93 A: and stuff so you need someone i think that is very that also can maybe grow with you 

435.79 436.53 B: [noise] 

438.46 439.66 B: mhm 

438.91 444.89 A: that's willing to grow so many times i've seen marriages where one or the other spouse um 

440.24 441.80 B: right 

444.87 445.66 A: was 

445.62 449.02 A: grew outside of the relationship 

448.29 449.25 B: right 

448.96 463.25 A: uh the the partners uh just grew outside of each other uh and that happens so you need someone who that will be supportive of you that's you know that'll accept you and that will be willing maybe even to grow with you 

455.95 457.03 B: (( mm [cough] )) 

462.73 474.02 B: right right well you have to i mean because it's either you grow together or you grow apart and you know you have to you have to have find somebody that is willing to do that because it won't work it's not [cough] 

467.01 468.18 A: that's right 

474.50 475.49 B: excuse me 

475.82 477.79 B: so i'm trying to think what else i 

478.00 482.42 B: i find in my mate oh um i mean if if you're going to 

482.46 490.62 B: get married and have children i think you you have to decide a lotta that too if that person is kind of on the same level as you 

490.20 491.87 A: (( mhm )) 

490.73 494.79 B: i mean not exactly but you have the basic 

495.55 496.71 B: the same 

496.22 500.81 A: yes and you better have found out before you married if they want children or not 

500.09 503.77 B: right oh definitely [laughter] definitely 

501.13 511.53 A: [laughter] yes you better have made before you better have made sure before you got married if both of you all have the same values on having children and 

510.41 512.16 B: right and how to raise them 

511.42 524.58 A: and how to raise them because after you get married then after you have a child then you discover both of you have different values that's that's so you have to make sure too that when you're picking a mate that you basically have the same values and everything 

523.91 525.07 B: mhm 

525.26 539.13 B: mhm yeah i mean like you can you know it's just the basics because i mean some things you can bring into the relationship like each person brings i mean they bring their own background and and variation is good but you still have to have that 

537.43 538.24 A: mhm 

539.28 544.07 B: solid foundation i think and you have to be able to find someone with the same 

540.99 541.92 A: right 

543.37 544.28 A: right 

544.13 544.91 B: same 

545.17 546.64 B: solid foundation 

545.86 550.11 A: and i don't really think at the same time uh the way everything is so 

549.92 561.84 A: uh different that you really need i know years ago people would look for somebody in their same social class and their same religion and i don't think that is as important now in finding a mate 

556.50 557.48 B: right 

561.26 564.89 B: no i don't either i don't either and and and you know what 

565.25 579.74 B: because things are are so different now i think that i mean some people still do that and and that's good i mean and if can find somebody and that makes you happen then that's fine but you know these days so many people are so different that you know 

572.03 573.14 A: mhm 

574.06 575.09 A: right 

579.77 582.95 B: that's not a big deal you know i i mean 

580.88 581.80 A: (( no )) 

581.97 595.10 A: i think that's um 'cause i think that looking like i said trying to find something in a mate i think that would be one of the things that i would not i i did not look for is someone that is in the same social class 

591.43 592.56 B: right 

594.97 599.89 A: uh same type of religion 'cause as a matter of fact my husband and i both uh have different religions
