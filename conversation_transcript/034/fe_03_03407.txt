101.28 102.59 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

103.30 104.59 B: (( yeah )) 

112.69 118.61 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] it's hard to say like we're we're very we're very different on a lot of levels like i um [sigh] 

119.02 127.52 A: um i am very i'm pretty outgoing and i'm fairly verbal like i'm not i write a lot and um [sigh] and he's not really so talkative and he's fairly quiet um 

127.31 139.49 A: a lot of the time but we both [sigh] we we share like we don't necessarily share the same politics about everything [sigh] though we have like a same sense of like ethics like he's an anarchist and like [sigh] um i i wouldn't consider 

133.41 134.32 B: okay 

139.39 147.77 A: consider myself an anarchist but like i definitely believe in a lot of the same [sigh] kind of ideals like [sigh] um like consensus 

147.58 150.89 A: and like community and [sigh] um 

150.75 157.27 A: like different senses of like justice and and feminism and things like that so it's like [sigh] we might have different 

154.98 155.71 B: (( uh-huh )) 

157.22 166.45 A: um sort of political names or or different politics for what we do but we definitely come from the same kind of place [sigh] um and that's highly important to me [sigh] um 

165.89 175.02 B: so in a sense you guys are actually on the opposite poles and uh you you attracting because of that like opposites attract 

174.78 176.69 A: [lipsmack] in some ways yeah 

176.04 178.71 B: in in in a sense yeah that's cool 

177.18 178.15 A: (( yeah )) 

178.47 181.00 A: [sigh] how about you are you involved with anybody 

180.85 188.04 B: no i'm single i was in a long term relationship for uh about nine years 

187.53 188.74 A: oh wow 

188.52 200.14 B: and uh i it was it was probably closer to ten years but on and off uh for uh about six of the years we were really strong and then the other four it was on and off 

199.75 200.82 A: mhm 

200.56 201.91 B: (( an uh )) 

202.73 213.13 B: i guess i i i i'm the same way in my last relationship we totally saw things uh [mn] the opposite as well um 

213.66 217.77 B: however you know we connected on certain levels 

217.55 219.99 A: mhm like what level did you connect on 

220.00 222.15 B: well we were a- we were both outgoing 

222.17 234.78 B: uh she was a little bit shyer than i was but we were still both ex- uh extroverted and uh i like to talk because uh you know i'm in the entertainment industry and that's what i do and uh 

235.70 236.05 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

236.02 236.67 B: i i love 

236.68 241.98 B: being around people and she loves being around people so when we went out we had fun and 

241.98 255.14 B: uh when we were uh spent time together it was always great so we were able to connect on that level and just the only thing i think it was is that nearly started separating us is you know 

255.02 265.51 B: [mn] people grow and you know you start looking for different things and if you're not working towards the same things together then it it it really puts a strain on a relationship 

264.83 266.45 A: yeah yeah 

266.78 281.24 B: so i mean for me now if i'm what i'm looking for is just somebody i could communicate with who who's intelligent and she's ambitious and she wants to do things and because that's the type of person i am 

272.73 273.79 A: mhm 

280.88 281.96 A: mhm 

282.00 286.16 A: [sigh] do you think that if you're with someone like um that 

286.24 293.50 A: either that like like had a different idea of like family like like i don't kn- do you want family like do you want to have kids or 

292.86 295.96 B: oh yeah i i do i want to have a lot of 'em 

295.08 303.16 A: do you think that if you uh like found um a partner that you really really loved but didn't want to have kids that you would you would still want to be with them 

303.27 317.88 B: well i think i could i would be able to compromise on uh certain things because if she just didn't want to have kids simply because of maybe a physical her you know her physical makeup or you know we can always adopt kids 

317.44 318.50 A: mhm 

317.72 324.82 B: uh but if she just didn't like kids for some reason then you know it would really be [sigh] uh hard 

324.22 331.56 A: [sigh] oh that's interesting so you would be like [sigh] it wouldn't be a deterrent as long as like she would be willing to adopt children 

331.63 333.11 B: yeah i mean you know 

331.79 335.54 A: so it's not like you would physically need to like [sigh] oh that's interesting 

335.43 348.99 B: yeah i mean i wouldn't say you know you have to have kids i- if you're if you don't think you can bear the kids or if you don't but if you just like 'em and you don't want 'em around then it becomes it it's a different issue 

348.61 350.77 A: mhm are you from a big family 

350.83 353.49 B: (( oh yeah there was uh eleven of us )) 

353.12 354.10 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

353.95 356.05 B: [laughter] yeah we had a really big family 

355.79 356.76 A: (( phew mm )) 

357.89 360.63 B: i'm from the east coast i'm from d._c. so 

360.32 361.52 A: (( oh okay )) 

361.03 364.60 B: i used to g- go to philly all the time i love it out there 

364.02 365.27 A: yeah 

364.96 367.52 B: yeah it's great a beautiful city 

366.88 370.49 A: yeah i like philly a lot too it's a good thing 

370.38 371.79 B: yeah it's all good 

371.92 377.34 A: [lipsmack] yeah [sigh] so you're not you're not dating a how long ago did you and your partner break up 

378.06 379.47 B: (( uh that was )) 

380.54 381.58 B: (( oh [lipsmack] nineteen )) 

381.74 389.01 B: uh nineteen ninety seven was the official break up but on and off we saw each other till about two thousand and one 

388.60 390.19 A: (( mm yeah )) 

390.03 394.25 B: and then other than that i just haven't been with anybody since then 

393.46 398.10 A: (( [sigh] yeah [lipsmack] it's a long it's it's hard when you you know )) 

398.16 399.11 A: (( to )) 

401.09 407.95 A: [sigh] to find someone that you know you want to be with especially after being so intensely involved with someone for a so long you know 

407.81 418.79 B: yeah i mean communication to me is is vital 'cause if we could talk about i i say let's talk about anything and we could get it out into the open and clear it up and then we can move forward [noise] 

416.62 417.79 A: mhm 

418.35 420.12 A: yeah yeah 

419.27 424.68 B: that's that's my thing if you know she stopped communicating and i was like i can't deal with this 

424.49 425.55 A: mhm 

425.77 427.29 B: it's too much 

426.83 429.48 A: [sigh] [sigh] do you think that like um 

429.37 444.21 A: what is what is your idea of like like relationships and like dating and stuff like do you think that it's okay to like [sigh] date more than one person at the same time or like do you think like are you like pretty like monogamous like from the g- go or or 

443.18 458.12 B: well if you're honest with the person and you say listen i'm really not set i'm not ready to settle down i'm going to see other people and i'm not going to limit you if you want to see other people and then if our relationship progressed to where we could cut those other people off 

457.73 458.88 A: mhm 

458.22 466.72 B: then it's all good but if you know i'm not going to just say hey uh i'm going to be with you and only you and then run around with everybody else 

459.58 460.54 A: mhm 

465.87 475.79 A: [sigh] yeah yeah that's the way i feel too it's like [sigh] you know i i 'cause i think that sometimes like people have to work with monogamy and sometimes like people don't you know and [sigh] 

475.17 476.38 B: (( yes of course )) 

475.69 481.18 A: and like and i don't condemn anything like in along those lines as long as like [sigh] the way i kind of 

481.01 492.54 A: i i sort of figure it's sort of like a game you know it's like you make up the rules and maybe you're playing hide and go seek maybe you're playing like capture the flag or soccer like whatever you're playing but you make up the rules [sigh] and then you stick by those rules [sigh] 

489.57 490.95 B: exactly 

492.17 493.37 B: exactly 

492.52 503.58 A: or you get thrown out you know like i've been involved in relationships before where they have been n- monogamous and i've been w- involved in ones that like [sigh] aren't monogamous and i've been involved with men and i've been involved with women and like [sigh] 

502.79 504.43 B: mhm 

503.46 514.47 A: all sort of you know all sorts of different things but i think the one thing is [sigh] you know and this is probably one of like sort of you know the most important [sigh] thing is it really comes down to honesty you know 

513.85 515.21 B: exactly 

514.64 518.49 A: and along those and like and just it's really about everything and 

518.39 527.89 A: [sigh] i can't say that like if i'm honest with somebody then like they're then like that's all the relationship needs to be you know 'cause it can be fucking boring [laughter] if it's honest like 

527.09 532.19 B: yes boring it can be extremely boring [laughter] yeah 

527.80 538.28 A: [sigh] or it can be like just incompatible or it can be like no fun i mean [sigh] it's not the only thing but like without it like i can't imagine like being involved in a relationship like 

537.61 551.43 B: yeah you said it that's exactly what it is i mean you know you got to have fun and you got to be you know be honest with the person you're with but [sigh] at the same time i mean like listen if we're just going you know go around in circles what's the point of that 

551.13 554.82 A: in [sigh] yeah yeah it's crazy 

552.75 553.59 B: (( you know )) 

554.63 557.07 B: it is wild [laughter] 

556.63 570.17 A: [sigh] do you um how about things about like uh uh issues of like age or race or race or gender or like are these or like economics like do you find yourself like [sigh] dating along certain lines or like do you think that like 

569.53 583.46 B: i hope i'm totally open i've dated all the entire spectrum me myself i'm you know uh economics in the financial situation is not really a problem i i have enough money to do whatever i want to do and [sigh] uh 

583.53 594.32 B: so that's never really a problem so if i meet a women who's just compatible and who is intelligent it's the most important thing to me i don't care if she's you know if she's a martian 

594.12 595.97 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

595.13 599.89 B: you know i mean if she was a martian that'd be cool too [laughter] it would be a new expe- 

597.67 599.95 A: (( [laughter] so you don't care what your ))
