332.70 333.79 B: (( [sigh] oh )) 

333.98 336.48 B: yeah i think it's three times 

335.88 342.90 A: yeah you you do it three times i don't know if they keep calling after that or not but i think you only get paid for three times 

342.72 345.46 B: yes i think [noise] you can only do it you know 

345.85 347.10 B: to three 

347.38 350.74 B: i don't know what what what do you call this interactions 

350.84 351.92 A: mhm 

351.33 353.93 B: on the phone and after that that's it 

353.99 355.12 A: oh 

355.34 357.89 B: i think i'm this is what i 

358.09 359.28 B: i was told 

358.95 359.94 A: mhm 

359.89 363.40 B: you know and i thought you had to keep the p._i._n. number near you 

363.25 364.57 A: right 

364.55 366.34 B: but um maybe 

365.48 367.85 A: so they didn't ask you for a p._i._n. number either 

367.52 368.60 B: no 

368.49 369.27 A: (( hm )) 

369.29 370.52 B: (( not at all )) 

370.21 371.85 A: that's weird 

371.47 375.65 B: not at all i know the lady made a point of giving me a p._i._n. number 

375.12 376.45 A: right 

376.48 384.72 B: and i i'm not gonna use that word but i thought because she gave me one that i would have to have it nearby 

384.25 385.31 A: right 

385.30 390.68 B: but no one asked me anything they just said [lipsmack] at the end something about comments 

390.11 392.76 A: yeah you can make a comment at the end so 

393.16 405.08 A: [lipsmack] i don't know i'm i'm wondering because um i was reading up on it today as a matter of fact and it said make sure you put your p._i._n. number in with um and then the pound key when they ask but they didn't ask so 

405.08 408.71 A: now i'm hoping that you know [laughter] you still get paid for 

407.15 410.90 B: you mean at the end of the conversation maybe they'll do that 

410.59 412.73 A: it i don't know maybe 

413.09 415.09 A: i guess we'll have to wait and find out [laughter] 

414.53 419.80 B: yeah you know it's it's kinda weird because this is your first time this is my first time 

419.43 420.17 A: yeah 

419.87 424.51 B: and we really don't know what they do at the end 

423.86 427.25 A: exactly [laughter] 

425.16 427.92 B: you know maybe they [laughter] do ask for it 

428.10 429.55 B: towards the end 

429.76 430.72 A: maybe 

430.59 431.61 B: yeah 

431.01 433.39 A: hm well that's interesting [sigh] 

433.19 437.09 B: no um what what else was they telling me um 

437.51 441.12 B: pretty much they're looking for men to do the studies 

440.67 447.10 A: yeah yeah yeah you can have whoever your spouse or partner or whoever 

441.34 442.25 B: to do 

447.23 452.98 A: anybody you know i guess you can have um do it sign up and do it in the same household so 

453.68 457.86 A: or if you if you want or and i think if you refer somebody too 

457.51 459.01 B: (( [noise] yes )) 

458.54 459.67 A: yeah 

459.19 461.49 B: that's another thing they were speaking on 

461.17 462.93 A: yeah 

461.96 465.66 B: they also told me that when you're talking don't um 

466.05 468.23 B: [lipsmack] don't get away from the subject 

468.69 470.84 A: too much yeah 

470.67 480.29 B: so okay what else do you see i don't know i i don't know how this really really really works when you're talking on the i guess it's all in a computer no 

471.73 472.80 A: (( [noise] )) 

480.20 483.42 A: it must be i yeah i think they tape it or whatever 

483.86 486.45 B: and then later on they play it back 

486.31 488.59 A: i guess i i don't really know 

488.31 490.59 B: (( [laughter] no i don't either i'm just )) 

490.81 492.49 B: so curious 

492.04 493.76 A: [laughter] i know me too 

492.83 496.14 B: you know my my brother told me about this 

495.63 503.75 A: yeah well i think that they give you a topic from what i understood is they give you a topic to talk about to get your conversation going 

503.91 508.97 A: but what they're actually trying to do is just to um they're doing a study on getting 

509.37 513.44 A: people who don't know each other and see how they would talk to each other 

514.20 516.86 B: oh yes 

514.81 516.27 A: you know what i'm saying 

516.30 519.15 A: and they just give you a topic to 

519.38 521.28 A: kind of get the ball rolling 

520.68 522.66 B: okay like breaking the ice 

521.99 526.53 A: exactly exactly i mean that's the way i understood it 

526.54 530.01 B: no that sounds that makes more sense than the other way 

529.53 530.75 A: (( um right )) 

530.43 533.24 B: so tell me about vermont [sigh] 

533.12 535.98 A: uh vermont well it's um

546.98 548.24 A: um 

548.48 549.75 A: i don't know 

550.66 555.07 A: not a whole heck of a lot going on there's not much action anywhere basically 

555.58 557.02 A: which um 

557.21 559.31 A: can be good and you know 

559.38 563.85 B: no definitely especially if you you come from the city
