60.87 69.11 B: (( so yeah i'm married so i mean let's talk about what are the qualities we expect in a life partner and maybe something like that what do you think )) 

69.81 80.77 A: okay what what are the qualities that i think i think the you you have to um have similar interests and you have to ha- and you have to know you know 

81.21 89.80 A: i mean you have you have to have similar interests and you have to know um you have to know a lot about the person you're getting involved with 

89.28 94.42 B: okay so that's that's one of the main quality that similar kind of interests 

93.84 103.30 A: yeah you definitely have to because i mean after a while i mean if you don't have anything in common it it it's gonna fade you know it's not going to work most of the time 

102.65 112.08 B: okay when you say when you talk about both should have common interests you are talking about the way people spend their time their extracurricular activities and 

111.28 114.64 A: right right yeah 

112.11 115.64 B: yeah the what do they do outside their work 

116.21 118.86 A: right well well i tell you 

116.33 117.42 B: are they 

117.67 118.86 B: (( are they )) 

119.61 132.71 A: well i tell you career is not so important but [mn] i think recreation wanting to spend your time together i mean you know one person likes to travel and the other one doesn't um i think that people eventually drift you know what i mean 

129.83 131.55 B: yeah 

132.61 135.84 B: i understand because obviously the tastes are really different 

136.76 138.06 A: yeah 

137.42 144.12 B: yeah so that makes yeah that's another thing yeah what are the other factors the thing which you would uh expect in a life partner 

145.00 146.59 A: what excuse me 

146.61 150.07 B: what other factors would you look in a life uh life partner 

150.14 151.40 A: um 

152.21 154.43 A: honesty [laughter] 

154.98 159.19 A: honesty that's pretty important and it's pretty hard to find um 

157.82 160.24 B: [mn] honesty is very important okay 

159.80 161.41 A: yes it is 

161.82 166.56 B: so you want you want life partner to be h- honest and sincere towards you 

162.20 163.01 A: and 

166.70 168.07 A: yeah yeah 

167.86 182.07 B: yeah same uh even i feel the same yeah [mn] and some of the things that uh both should have similar qualities and both should be honest and sincere to each other and the third factor which i look in life partner 

182.42 185.50 B: (( is the ability to say )) 

186.05 188.93 B: (( adjust to each other's weaknesses )) 

189.88 194.42 B: because obviously human beings each one have got their own weakness 

194.75 195.95 A: yeah 

195.00 199.83 B: so [mn] instead of uh trying to find fault with someone's weaknesses 

199.90 210.08 B: [mn] the life partner is understanding towards the other person's weakness and tries to help the person to overcome their weakness then it's a really good thing 

209.97 210.99 A: yes 

210.81 220.72 B: yeah maybe that's a factor which i think about yeah so uh what are the different um avenues that you use to [mn] uh identify a 

220.79 222.05 B: life partner 

222.37 226.32 B: do you are you a member of on line dating sites 

227.03 228.60 A: (( [mn] no )) 

228.71 229.75 B: okay 

229.03 230.01 A: no 

230.41 232.09 A: no i guess uh 

232.86 234.22 A: (( how do i )) 

234.79 239.07 A: how [mn] how i guess i don't know it's a little bit um 

240.32 242.51 A: it's a little bit um 

242.73 244.50 A: hard to uh 

246.72 252.46 A: it's a little bit hard to um oh boy how do i usually through through friends 

252.49 254.01 B: mhm 

253.41 255.05 A: usually through friends 

255.07 256.01 B: okay 

255.10 257.35 A: um yeah 

257.05 260.11 B: and maybe during friday night parties and 

259.82 260.88 A: (( right yeah )) 

260.79 270.25 B: okay something like that okay and how long do you think someone sh- uh you should know your partner before you decide that sh- she is your life partner 

270.49 271.87 A: (( at least a year )) 

271.77 273.15 B: at least a year 

273.12 274.80 A: yeah 

275.16 280.15 B: know about each one's likeness weaknesses what do they like what do they dislike 

281.09 283.16 B: yeah and things like that okay 

283.26 291.15 B: so that sounds good so what are your what are your other things which you think we should talk about since we are talking about life partners 

291.25 298.70 A: uh well i i [mn] i shouldn't say this but i guess i'm gonna go ahead and say it anyway 

298.85 299.90 A: um 

300.87 303.14 A: some of the important things 

303.05 304.11 B: mhm 

303.49 305.33 A: (( are um )) 

305.51 309.00 A: i think uh similar economic interests 

309.72 311.48 B: oh okay uh-huh 

311.56 315.96 B: (( in terms of [mn] the future right )) 

315.52 318.74 A: yeah because i i know this is sad to say 

318.62 332.23 A: but um and and and and and this is a true fact that um i and this this is this is a fact that ha- um half the marriages in america end up over divorce 

322.67 324.03 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

332.13 335.82 A: and seventy five percent of those half 

335.89 340.15 A: the pr- or eight percent it have to do with money 

340.77 341.91 B: okay 

341.86 345.61 A: yeah because basically i i i i mean know 

345.38 352.32 A: know your partner's economic interest i mean there are people that don't don't don't have high expectations but if you're someone 

352.09 365.48 A: you know that wants you know i mean you know that wants to travel every year and wants a second house you know you got to already know that going into the relationship that if that partner's not going to provide that then you know [laughter] look elsewhere yeah 

363.45 367.77 B: i understand that makes a lot of sense that makes a lot of sense actually 

367.59 368.42 A: yeah 

367.74 381.60 B: because i think uh uh both should have the same kind of economic interests [mn] and we were talking about the recreational things but i think more important than the recreational thing is economic interest because the way one works the one the way one 

372.37 373.35 A: right 

378.16 379.05 A: yeah 

381.78 386.83 B: [mn] have have aim on other things it depends on what kind of economic interest one 

387.23 396.04 B: if the other partner wants to go to say the caribbean islands every year and want to go on a cruise every year then [laughter] 

391.25 392.10 A: right 

396.34 401.10 B: [mn] other economic portion may not allow us to do that yeah 

400.15 402.75 A: yeah yeah it's it's pretty important in a way 

402.59 405.08 B: yeah that that makes a lot of sense yes 

403.15 403.71 A: (( [mn] )) 

404.83 407.15 A: yeah you know even though it doesn't uh 

407.22 408.12 A: (( you know )) 

408.46 409.67 A: you know it does 

408.64 423.25 B: okay and as you said since uh you are talking about similar interests and other things do you think uh internet dating is a good way to find a life partner because i know some of my friends who have never the met the girl they 

423.53 430.99 B: they had internet chat for say five five to six months then they met for a short period maybe for a month 

431.16 432.93 B: (( [cough] and then they got married )) 

433.47 434.55 A: mm 

434.70 437.60 B: okay do you think this kind of marriages will stay 

438.08 441.68 A: uh you know maybe [laughter] 

441.14 447.15 B: okay because definitely over the internet you don't [mn] have the personal touch right 

447.17 448.28 A: right 

447.57 453.56 B: y- you don't see how the person reacts you don't know how she or he looks like and other stuff 

453.73 465.04 A: well you want to know something it it's sad but i know people that have just left their uh i know people that have left their partners um 

463.71 464.93 B: (( mhm )) 

465.41 469.41 A: yeah you know just went ahead and left their partners um 

468.22 469.15 B: okay 

469.93 479.03 A: for you know a guy as a matter of fact a guy that worked with me he did he left his wife and everything for someone he just met over the internet he moved out of state [laughter] 

478.57 486.54 B: [laughter] so [mn] that sounds uh [mn] interesting yes see these kind of things happen yeah 

479.62 480.50 A: yeah 

483.40 484.91 A: yeah yeah 

485.57 496.93 A: yeah and you know he never met her or anything so you want to know something if you want if you want my honest opinion i think that doesn't if to me there was something wrong in his relationship anyway you know 

491.35 493.33 B: mhm 

497.21 498.30 B: okay 

498.22 503.69 A: that's how i that's [mn] if you have a strong good relationship you won't be looking for people over the internet [laughter] 

503.02 509.66 B: okay so if you had inclinations to go the relationship you will definitely find it some way or the other 

509.43 510.70 A: oh yeah 

510.19 518.21 B: yeah you you might go to the internet or you might go to [mn] different party or you might meet someone over the train or something like this might happen 

518.07 522.35 A: yeah 'cause if you're married you know you just go [laughter] yeah 

521.80 527.83 B: yeah i understand that yeah definitely okay so that sounds in- this is is this the first time you are participating in this 

527.83 537.95 A: yeah well you know wh- yeah i just participated but last night um i got a call i didn't know what it was and for some reason it just got dropped for some reason i was talking 

531.39 532.36 B: uh-huh 

537.58 538.49 B: uh-huh 

537.71 547.66 A: but you know i i i i didn't realise you have to talk to somebody else i just kept on talking you know and then i realised the phone got disconnected so now yeah now i know what it's all about so [mn] 

542.82 543.67 B: uh-huh 

546.86 551.54 B: yeah actually i think it's uh it's uh this is the second time i am doing this 

551.71 552.72 A: yeah 

552.21 563.50 B: yeah this actually i think they are trying to see how people can over phone and on different topics how do they and i don't know but it it it seems kind of interesting 

563.61 567.02 A: yeah it is it's a good th- it's a good thing it is yeah 

566.17 567.98 B: yeah so 

567.85 581.43 B: so that was good uh good to know about what you think about life partners and what do you think are different factors and do you think uh the kind of i was reading somewhere that people are becoming very ambitious nowadays 

581.31 584.83 B: and they are putting their career ahead of relationships 

581.56 582.37 A: yeah 

584.91 591.73 B: so do you think that is a reason for increasing amount of single people and divorces happening 

592.02 593.57 A: yeah definitely 

592.71 596.27 B: people are putting more importance with career than personal life 

596.46 597.68 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

597.45 599.60 B: okay so you think that's a factor
