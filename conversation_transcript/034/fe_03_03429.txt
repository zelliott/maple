4.77 6.46 A: you can go first [laughter] 

6.40 13.20 B: [laughter] okay fine um what did they say what's the most important thing to look for 

10.97 12.39 A: the topic is 

12.89 14.64 A: in your partner yep 

13.76 16.44 B: (( oh okay um [lipsmack] )) 

16.54 21.44 B: well i guess i would say the number one thing is 

21.53 23.82 B: whether or not you want children 

24.69 26.63 A: oh that's yeah that's a good thought 

27.02 29.35 A: i wouldn't have thought of that first but 

28.41 30.84 B: [laughter] what would you have thought of first 

30.74 41.31 A: i was just thinking you know making sure that you have the same well i guess it's along the same lines the same goals in life and able to get along and i guess kids do come along 

37.62 39.04 B: right 

41.64 44.11 A: in that respect as to whether you know so 

41.82 42.64 B: right 

44.81 45.64 B: yeah 

46.15 46.71 B: (( [cough] )) 

47.90 50.28 B: i guess for me since 

50.42 55.02 B: children was one of my main goals in life i whoops hello 

52.66 53.94 A: (( [noise] )) 

54.71 56.73 A: (( yep i don't know what )) 

55.56 59.80 B: okay that was strange [laughter] i don't know what that meant [laughter] 

57.27 63.00 A: yeah i was gonna say that as well i don't know what that meant either i don't think it meant ten minutes was up [laughter] 

61.52 68.10 B: no i don't think so [laughter] i guess for me since kids were such a primary goal for me i couldn't have 

68.12 75.91 B: been with no matter what if my relationship with somebody was wonderful if they didn't want kids i would've thought that would've been a no go 

76.66 86.43 A: yeah you have to know your priorities and make sure they at least meet the majority of your priorities and to learn that you cannot change them [laughter] 

86.17 87.76 B: right [laughter] 

87.32 91.60 A: no matter how much you think oh i'll marry him and i will change him it doesn't work that way 

90.92 94.17 B: right for some reason a lotta people think that 

93.88 96.92 A: yes they do mm you can't 

96.93 98.01 B: right 

97.37 102.58 A: especially with like you said something as important as children if somebody's set on not having any 

103.06 108.14 A: it's very hard to be able to change that big of a priority 

103.16 104.22 B: right 

107.07 108.04 B: yeah 

108.32 121.97 B: i do know people who've had kids who thought originally no that wasn't something that they were interested in and actually they had told their partner originally that they were going to have kids and then um 

122.66 133.37 B: you know and later on five years ten years down the road they've been married so what about kids well i never really wanted any well then why did you tell me you would because you wouldn't have married me if i hadn't 

133.44 135.43 B: and i always thought that was kind of a 

133.53 134.65 A: yeah 

135.45 136.55 B: [laughter] 

136.00 137.42 A: yeah that's a big 

137.45 147.89 A: change and adjustment my cousin was like that he said he didn't want any but now he has two and it's totally different than this first marriage was he's like a hundred percent hands on dad 

148.00 152.10 A: and it's so funny to see when he was like no i don't want any more and then 

148.01 148.97 B: right 

152.56 162.77 A: he goes ahead and has them and becomes a hands on but i think that's another thing when you want look for a life partner is how hands on do you want him to be and are they going to be 

163.06 166.16 B: right how much involve what kind 

163.71 164.62 A: (( you know )) 

167.26 171.13 B: of what even your ideas are of what a relationship is you know 

170.47 172.84 A: well right that's true too they may 

172.90 177.18 A: hey if i i support you that's all i should have to do you 

176.75 178.08 B: right [laughter] 

177.33 179.67 A: know some people think that way 

180.09 181.55 A: (( you know but )) 

182.53 189.41 A: yeah but i agree i i didn't think of children but yeah children probably would be especially if it's somebody who doesn't want them 

187.14 187.98 B: right 

190.46 193.64 B: yeah or does desperately [cough] 

192.84 195.08 A: (( right and you don't )) 

195.25 197.26 A: and then how many as well 

195.57 196.94 B: yeah 

197.54 201.15 B: yeah that was definitely a topic for my husband and i. [laughter] 

201.25 204.41 B: he wanted as many children as he could possibly have 

201.46 202.26 A: yeah 

204.25 205.48 A: oh wow 

205.36 207.10 B: yeah [laughter] 

205.77 211.24 A: [laughter] that that makes see that's the other spectrum too it makes you think like wow 

211.89 212.85 B: right 

212.49 216.24 A: you know wait a minute i only wanna have x. amount well never mind 

215.33 221.34 B: right it's funny too 'cause you know it changed for us like when we got married at first it was 

221.42 227.07 B: i had agreed that we would have five kids and then after i had two i said wow 

227.09 230.47 B: five i don't know that's a lot [laughter] 

229.33 237.84 A: yeah right priorities change too right yeah i only have one and i have two stepchildren so it was more than enough for me 

236.36 236.92 B: (( [noise] )) 

237.51 241.36 B: right did you have so you had the stepchildren and then you had the one 

240.86 247.82 A: yeah and then we had the one yeah the stepchildren actually were were with us for about ten years and then they moved out of the house then we had our own 

247.73 252.05 B: oh wow so it was like starting all over from the beginning again huh 

251.54 259.91 A: well yeah but i didn't go they were like when we married they were like seven and nine so it was like i didn't go through their early ages 

257.20 258.12 B: uh-huh 

259.87 262.73 B: right but then they lived in your house with you 

260.41 261.34 A: so 

262.57 264.59 A: yeah they lived with us fulltime 

264.64 265.47 B: wow 

265.06 269.29 A: and that is a big thing to think about too when you're looking at somebody and 

269.65 271.21 A: what not so 

271.29 279.11 B: right that must've been an interesting decision you even getting involved in that relationship knowing that there were kids that were part of it 

275.69 277.11 A: yeah well 

277.47 278.70 A: yeah right 

279.02 285.53 A: right that the kids were part well as a kid you know you hear about them the son married the kid across the street well that's what i did 

285.62 287.20 B: [laughter] 

286.29 289.53 A: i married the kid literally across the street 

289.23 290.49 B: no that's funny 

290.05 291.07 A: so 

291.23 292.13 A: (( but )) 

292.24 297.58 A: yeah it's that's yeah there's a lotta things to think about before you get married to discuss to 

297.74 298.81 B: right 

298.28 304.62 A: make sure everyone's on the same like do they want you to work all the time or can i stay home that's a big one too 

302.36 303.64 B: (( right [noise] )) 

304.65 308.56 B: yeah that is fortunately that worked out pretty well with us i mean i 

309.32 320.63 B: we got married probably before we really knew each other and a lotta things just kinda came together and we got even pregnant before we really discussed much [laughter] and i had said you know 

318.35 319.34 A: yeah 

320.82 327.28 B: hesitantly i always sort of thought that i would stay home with my child if i ever 

327.72 333.31 B: became a mother and you know wasn't really sure what his reaction would be and fortunately it was a 

333.43 335.62 B: well yeah duh [laughter] 

335.22 338.47 A: well like why you even mentioning that that wasn't even up for 

336.03 336.83 B: so 

337.51 338.44 B: right 

338.96 339.93 A: yeah 

339.00 346.29 B: up for discussion which was good that it just so happened that we were completely on the same page and i guess that's why we ended up together but 

346.55 349.53 B: i think we kinda got lucky in a lot of ways 

346.92 347.95 A: right 

348.92 356.20 A: yeah i think a lotta things like you say you think about 'em you discuss 'em beforehand but then after you get married there's so much more that 

350.24 351.08 B: (( [laughter] )) 

356.60 357.87 B: right 

356.75 359.96 A: comes up and that you didn't even think about discussing 

360.09 361.76 B: right that's for sure 

360.47 363.90 A: you know like where you wanna be in ten years or 

364.32 366.34 A: (( you know things of that sort )) 

366.58 369.27 B: right [noise] lifelong goals 

369.45 376.48 A: right yep yeah and another thing like i said life partners it's tough 

376.50 383.79 A: nowadays i think too many kids get married and they just uh if it doesn't work out just get divorced and they do it so quickly 

381.41 382.90 B: forget it right 

383.99 385.06 B: yeah 

384.15 387.15 A: you know it's like excuse me you guys 

386.46 390.77 B: it must be incredibly easy to get divorced i mean 

390.82 395.47 B: i don't know it it is kinda weird it's like if you had time to sit and talk it through 

396.86 400.51 A: yeah but kids people now the kids nowadays that get married they don't even 

401.21 406.40 A: it's like i'm mad we'll get you know i'm divorced and that's it talk it out what's that mean 

404.32 405.47 B: right 

406.33 412.90 B: right i mean i'm sure that my first year of marriage could've easily ended in divorce if we had chosen 

407.04 408.01 A: (( you know )) 

412.94 415.55 B: to allow it that path 

413.00 422.92 A: well that right if you you have an argument or whatever nowadays i think that's what people do they get mad and they just say that's it they don't bother working it out or anything 

420.57 421.69 B: (( right it's )) 

423.12 424.36 B: kinda sad 

423.32 424.19 A: (( you know )) 

424.66 429.66 A: yes it is it makes you realize where you know society is going and what's gonna happen 

429.82 430.84 B: right 

430.34 431.97 A: (( you know down the road )) 

432.31 433.29 B: right 

432.54 433.29 A: (( so )) 

433.97 435.67 B: how long have you been married 

436.05 441.68 A: too long [laughter] no seven- sorry i think seventeen seventeen eight- eighteen years this june 

437.15 439.38 B: [laughter] 

441.09 443.41 B: oh wow that is a long time 

443.18 453.35 A: yeah yep it's a long time i think my husband's a truck driver so he's on the road he's at away at least one night a week and i think that's what saves us sometimes 

450.94 451.96 B: yeah 

452.98 463.30 B: yeah [laughter] right my sister's husband lives in a whole another state i mean they're happily married but he went back to the military and she stayed in the town that they live in 

453.49 454.80 A: (( [laughter] you know )) 

463.32 468.83 B: and i think honestly it helped their relationship to be apart that much 

468.96 470.08 A: yeah 

470.01 484.12 A: yeah well when we first got married he was like all the time on the road so it took me a long time to get used to him being home now he's home all the time and so now it's kinda nice you know 'cause it's maybe about one or two nights about two or three nights a month which is kinda nice 

476.66 477.70 B: (( oh really )) 

483.92 484.83 B: yeah 

484.39 488.26 A: (( yeah and i don't have to worry about getting home and cooking dinner and )) 

487.97 489.64 B: right [laughter] 

488.53 493.56 A: when you have kids they demand enough from ya and you don't have to worry about somebody else demanding something else so 

491.02 491.95 B: (( [mn] )) 

493.62 503.84 B: right yeah i kind of am looking forward to that time when my kids are a little less demanding and perhaps i can have somewhat of a life to myself perhaps [laughter] 

503.40 510.65 A: yeah right yeah it'll h- it'll happen soon and then then it happens and you wonder what happened it's like oh wait i want 'em back [laughter] 

508.37 509.32 B: right 

510.54 513.73 B: yeah everybody keeps telling me back but i can't imagine 

514.91 520.23 B: i don't know [laughter] i mean i'm glad to have 'em in my house for sure but the baby thing is kinda 

520.54 531.74 A: yeah yeah i was he's mine's mine's eight nine now and it's like oh that's nice nice age you know i enjoyed him when they get to be about three is when you're sorta through all the 

520.72 521.85 B: tiring 

531.80 534.25 A: toilet training and all that and then it gets 

531.98 532.89 B: (( mm )) 

534.67 536.00 A: pretty nice 

535.91 541.65 B: yeah i think that definitely after toilet training is the good next step [laughter] 

541.51 543.94 A: (( yeah i know but )) 

545.48 549.32 A: yeah like i say with life partners you've just gotta kinda find out 

549.34 553.43 A: where you're at and that you're both are on the same wavelength 

553.93 554.97 B: right 

555.38 558.74 B: and be able to give up things that 

558.57 562.08 A: (( yeah you have to be willing to compromise you've got to make sure )) 

561.22 568.22 B: i don't know i used to think that that was a big thing to be able to compromise but then i realized that a lotta things are really compromisable you know 

568.21 580.15 A: well right there are that's why you've gotta be able to the big things in life like you say the children and where you're gonna live and family and whether you're gonna work after you have the kids that's stuff you really can't compromise on it's 

580.27 592.28 B: right so it either has to be like well either like big things for sure you have to just be on the same page or it's not gonna work you know but then there's a ton of little stuff that's that's like you just 

580.50 582.08 A: kind of a yes or no 

587.65 588.81 A: right 

592.93 599.89 B: if you're not totally there with it it doesn't mean that your relationship can't work out but it's not like you can say well how 'bout you get
