18.62 20.05 B: yeah 

19.42 25.14 A: and i'm thirty about to be thirty five i've been with the same girl for 

22.98 23.86 B: wow 

25.27 28.71 A: more than twelve years and we're still not married 

26.70 27.65 B: mhm 

28.51 29.75 B: okay 

29.21 36.37 A: and just from experience i'd have to say the absolute most important thing is honesty 

36.57 41.84 A: you know openness and honesty you know being able even if you've made a mistake 

38.64 39.61 B: yeah 

41.56 42.49 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

41.87 49.43 A: you have to be able to go to that person and say you know here's you know uh like i had a problem with cocaine for a little while and you know 

49.08 50.10 B: okay 

49.58 54.95 A: instead of her finding out you know i just went to her and i said listen you know i've 

51.31 52.38 B: mhm 

54.97 61.04 A: you know i've found this guy he's got a good deal on cocaine and i've kind of been you know throwing my money at him and 

61.12 62.60 B: yeah 

61.26 68.45 A: you know and instead of freaking out you know she was really understanding and we made it through that little phase you now 

67.26 68.92 B: (( mm )) 

68.62 79.99 A: and so i mean honesty is always the best policy and if it doesn't work out you know hey you know [mn] there's thousands and thousands of other people out there that would be willing to love you i mean 

78.72 80.06 B: (( mm )) 

80.23 83.00 A: that's proven everyday to [mn] 

80.26 81.15 B: yeah 

81.72 83.77 B: (( yeah you have to find the right one )) 

83.72 92.86 A: yeah i mean you you see ugly people walking down the street with kids so that proves that everybody can find somebody you know 

84.69 85.61 B: yeah 

91.26 95.06 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah you are right [laughter]

111.13 112.08 A: (( yeah )) 

111.93 116.24 B: uh i think it's almost as similar to this um the honesty you 

116.50 120.99 B: know that you have to tell the people uh you have to tell your spouse what you think 

121.07 131.01 B: and uh she will response you like uh a very similar way i mean maybe i think uh there is there should be some difference between two people but 

130.45 132.39 A: oh there's always going to be right 

131.78 134.61 B: but the difference should be shouldn't be too much 

134.47 135.62 A: [mn] yeah yeah

447.59 456.27 A: if she ever wants to leave i want her to be able to just pick up her stuff and walk away i don't want her to have to go find a lawyer to tell her that she can walk away from me 

455.81 457.28 B: mhm 

456.58 468.76 A: you know i mean it's just it's a little more freedom and i you know a little less traditional and that's me anyway you know because i was raised christian and i'm a buddhist now so 

459.64 460.55 B: mhm 

466.27 467.09 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

468.77 469.84 B: okay

473.31 474.78 B: (( so uh [mn] )) 

474.89 479.34 B: besides the honesty um what areas you think 

479.37 483.28 B: you choose her as your maybe future life partner 

481.67 486.95 A: um this may sound 

487.46 491.89 A: vulgar to some people but to me you have to fit together sexually 

492.06 493.95 B: mhm yeah 

492.27 493.11 A: (( you know )) 

493.35 494.93 A: i mean if 

495.53 497.21 A: if she's 

497.95 512.80 A: [lipsmack] more than what you expected or you're less than what she expected or vica versa you know it just doesn't work because she's either not or feeling pain or something you know and it just doesn't work out that way 

498.09 498.68 B: (( mhm )) 

503.18 504.34 B: mhm 

510.40 511.27 B: yeah 

512.54 513.65 B: yeah 

513.05 516.13 A: and i've been with a lot of women and 

516.19 519.16 A: eileen and i just you know we fit together well 

518.68 519.89 B: mhm 

519.27 526.75 A: and it's you know we hardly ever have sex anymore because you know we're [laughter] we're basically married [mn] you know we live in the same house and everything 

526.46 529.78 B: yeah yeah there should be harmony there 

527.32 528.20 A: so 

529.63 534.98 A: yeah it it has to be i mean you 'cause if that's what makes 

531.59 532.32 B: (( mhm )) 

535.27 542.83 A: the husband wife relationship what it is is the ability to go to bed at night and 

542.96 549.43 A: you know love someone intimately you know it's not just somebody it's the person that you want to love 

545.62 546.32 B: (( yeah )) 

549.14 550.59 B: yeah 

549.87 550.73 A: so 

550.82 557.07 B: yeah i think it's more open now for all chinese to talk about sex 

557.39 559.64 B: you know uh i mean um 

559.82 564.52 B: i i understand even a few years ago if some people want a divorce 

564.76 570.25 B: they are they were very shy to say the sex is the one kind of reason 

570.54 579.83 B: but now people are just i i don't know how i just can say they [laughter] are more open say uh we are not fit with each other in uh sex 

579.73 580.64 A: yeah 

580.14 583.38 B: yeah yeah i think that's an important thing 

583.44 587.39 A: yeah and a lot of women now are able to say 

587.50 595.88 A: you know what they want you know out of a sex partner or a life partner or something and then again a lot of women are just too 

589.16 590.12 B: mhm 

592.95 593.86 B: yeah 

595.99 599.95 A: hung up on being vain you know they they they look for a man 

596.11 596.69 B: (( mhm ))
