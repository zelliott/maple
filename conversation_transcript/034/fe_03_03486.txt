21.17 22.88 B: oh very nice 

23.52 25.26 A: yep so where in new york do you live 

25.08 31.87 B: uh right in the middle of manhattan about uh two minutes from central park i go running through central park every day 

31.43 32.42 A: i'll be 

32.16 33.26 B: yeah 

32.66 37.66 A: yep well i live in uh southern minnesota here austin is the name of the town 

36.41 39.59 B: oh nice nice 

38.56 42.14 A: so uh where did you how long have you known your wife where did you meet your wife 

42.12 50.16 B: oh very very interesting you know i am actually from india originally and my wife is an american she's jewish american 

49.82 51.04 A: mhm 

50.38 54.09 B: and i met my wife uh in 

54.31 59.22 B: nineteen ninety which was when i was going to school at cornell 

58.83 59.93 A: mhm 

59.46 69.56 B: and i used to be passing by and she used to say hey come stay with me so i did and we very very good friends for like ten years and we got married uh uh last year 

70.43 71.00 A: (( [mn] )) 

72.02 81.81 B: so it's kinda interesting we'd known each other for a long long period of time as as friends and we just got married last year and our one year anniversary is coming up 

81.20 88.24 A: i'll be so how did you make the decision to go from being friends to having a romantic relationship 

87.91 101.47 B: well that's a good question that's a very very good question i mean how do you make the decision it's so hard i think the most important thing for me at least is you know you know passion dies so quickly 

100.81 101.99 A: mhm 

101.37 106.60 B: uh as does romance i think because i'm a very very practical person you know 

106.18 107.32 A: mhm 

106.69 108.90 B: (( and if you know )) 

108.83 123.00 B: you know i know a lotta people for whom romance is uh number one which is great but i feel you know if you're gonna be spending such a long period of time with one person you've gotta have you know you've gotta get along as friends first 

122.45 123.36 A: sure 

123.19 126.75 B: you know if you can't if you can't stand the sight of each other 

126.85 140.34 B: uh after a few years together once the romance and the passion dies then it's gonna be kinda hard because you know eventually i think it it will because you know two people living together for a long long period of time and you get to know each other so well 

140.12 144.94 A: yeah that's right and you don't wanna you don't wanna be miserable once everything dies down 

144.43 149.74 B: exactly exactly i mean you know how does the what do you sustain a relationship on 

150.60 153.46 A: so i assume that coming from india you're not jewish 

150.78 151.40 B: (( you know )) 

153.55 155.62 B: no i'm not jewish actually no 

155.29 159.41 A: mhm and how did you you're not you didn't convert or anything like that 

158.41 166.57 B: no i didn't both my wife and i are completely non practicing non religious people i'm i'm a hindu 

166.24 167.72 A: mhm 

166.87 173.53 B: but that doesn't mean anything to me at all because you know i never went to a temple and uh you know i eat beef 

173.55 180.20 B: and uh uh my wife tells me i'm the most un-hindu hindu person she's ever met in her life 

179.68 182.35 A: [laughter] 

181.56 191.38 B: and you know she's not uh you know she has a very very good knowledge of jewish history and tradition but she is by no stretch of the imagination religious 

191.06 192.51 A: mhm 

191.85 197.89 B: so i think religion is not part of uh a common element at all 

198.26 199.35 B: what about you 

199.40 200.90 A: well i uh 

200.91 204.52 A: i met my wife in the dormitory at iowa state university 

204.07 205.73 B: oh very nice 

205.46 208.40 A: and i was i was a junior and she was a freshman 

207.92 209.27 B: uh-huh 

208.59 219.74 A: she's two years younger than me and that was about uh about ten years ago and oh we you know we married right out of college and and uh well actually she was still in college while when we got married but we i was out 

219.42 221.59 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

219.88 224.21 A: and uh we've been married ever since we've we've moved around a little bit since then but 

224.22 227.00 B: oh my god that's the classic romance 

226.38 231.36 A: well kinda yeah yeah she'd only been on campus for three weeks when i met her 

228.06 229.07 B: [laughter] 

231.02 232.45 B: oh really okay 

231.56 242.47 A: and we started dating as soon as i met we as soon as we met so she didn't last very long as a single college girl [laughter] so that was that that worked out real well 

237.50 240.81 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh [laughter] )) 

241.21 243.69 B: you were her knight in shining armor huh 

243.08 248.02 A: that's right i was a little older you know i i was kinda the cool guy you know the the older guy 

247.87 254.08 B: oh absolutely yes that's nice and uh so you've been married for a long long time now uh-huh 

253.50 257.74 A: yeah almost yeah just about seven years we're just coming up on our seventh anniversary 

257.13 259.04 B: very nice do you have children 

258.46 260.00 A: nope not yet 

259.39 260.43 B: okay 

260.25 266.67 A: i ended up going back to school shortly after we got married and then uh i went to law school and 

265.99 267.38 B: oh you did did 

266.95 272.29 A: yep and now i'm outta that and we didn't wanna have kids while i was in law school because that's pretty stressful 

271.39 272.95 B: (( do you go to law school ))

274.62 276.21 B: oh very nice 

275.53 277.85 A: it's a it's a small school and 

277.12 279.10 B: and what did you specialize in 

278.91 280.85 A: well uh 

280.18 281.67 B: if that's the right question 

281.39 287.24 A: well it it is the right question in in law school there aren't things like majors or anything you just kinda take 

285.86 288.00 B: (( right )) 

287.33 291.72 A: you take general courses in law but in my practice i do a lotta divorces 

291.43 292.77 B: a lotta what 

292.17 293.36 A: divorces 

292.87 294.80 B: oh [laughter] 

293.51 296.97 A: [laughter] which is kind of ironic considering that we're talking about marriage 

295.77 298.74 B: yeah you don't wanna get any business from home 

298.25 300.06 A: that's right that's right

307.99 308.97 A: yep 

308.46 313.61 B: so and they're very two very good schools in new york one is columbia the other one's n. y. u. 

313.27 314.46 A: mhm

318.60 322.14 A: sure well n. y. u. i i have a friend who graduated from n. y. u. 

321.57 322.78 B: oh really wow

323.48 324.37 B: (( it's a )) 

324.96 325.92 B: good school 

325.64 328.65 A: but uh well cornell has a good law school 

328.46 329.32 B: who 

329.05 331.03 A: doesn't cornell have a good law school too 

330.67 338.18 B: oh well cornell it does you know but the biggest problem with cornell is well i went to cornell as an undergraduate i went to cornell 

336.05 337.11 A: yeah 

338.20 341.22 A: (( and uh oh you'd mentioned that )) 

340.19 341.89 B: yeah i i did mention that 

341.48 345.85 A: but how how far is that from the city that's in that's a long way away isn't it 

344.62 358.93 B: well it's about uh a hundred and fifty miles it's about three hours but the biggest problem with cornell is you know it's in the middle of nowhere you know manhattan's right in the middle of of a huge city and there's so many opportunities here 

349.73 350.91 A: mhm 

353.89 355.09 A: right right 

358.52 359.73 A: mhm 

358.90 363.24 B: and cornell is a great university it's a great college but the weather sucks 

363.12 364.43 A: oh yeah 

363.42 374.86 B: it's too cold and it's it's in the middle of nowhere you know so the law school is good but i say hey listen i've already spent three almost four years at cornell do i really wanna go there and spend more time 

371.64 372.61 A: mhm 

375.46 376.35 A: sure 

375.92 384.68 B: which is a nothing you know it's just a college now there's just two colleges there's uh cornell and college and most of the people who live there are you know 

382.17 383.21 A: mhm 

384.79 386.18 B: college people 

385.71 389.57 A: mhm [lipsmack] um so what you decide to go back to law school 

389.88 397.77 B: uh interesting well my wife for one because her uh mother was actually a judge in new york 

397.20 398.49 A: (( hm )) 

397.87 406.51 B: and uh i had been planning for the longest time what i did was after cornell i worked in my family business in india we have a hotel chain small hotel chain 

406.04 407.10 A: mhm 

406.45 419.71 B: and then i said listen i need to you know get an m. b. a. and do something in finance and then i said hey listen you know law school actually sounds so much more exciting because you know most of what i would do most of the work that i would do at business school 

419.71 422.29 B: uh is uh stuff that i already know 

422.02 423.30 A: sure yep 

422.43 425.20 B: so yeah and since i'm gonna be working for myself 

425.42 428.46 B: eventually i really don't need a degree 

428.48 432.78 B: (( so you know maybe law is uh because it's it's interesting )) 

432.41 435.01 A: law school is a great exercise 

434.37 435.76 B: oh yeah 

435.09 436.55 A: it is it's uh 

436.51 439.21 B: you recommend it you recommend it 

437.64 438.67 A: what 

438.86 447.69 A: oh absolutely absolutely and and uh it's it's best for the people who aren't trying to get the the jobs at the huge law firm 

447.37 448.27 B: really 

447.83 451.04 A: because you won't you won't feel the pressure that everybody else feels 

450.42 451.78 B: wow 

451.21 458.11 A: and what kills people in law school is the pressure because you just people go nuts over it because you it's very competitive 

453.94 454.83 B: uh-huh 

456.07 457.00 B: uh-huh 

457.58 458.56 B: uh-huh 

458.54 465.59 A: you know and uh of course the two law schools you're thinking about are going to extremely competitive because they're because they're top notch schools but uh 

462.80 463.80 B: oh yeah 

464.38 465.40 B: oh yeah 

465.69 473.58 A: you know in in law school everybody all they care about is their class rank you know all that and if you can if you don't have to worry about that as much as others 

468.87 469.92 B: right 

470.22 471.05 B: right 

473.25 474.25 B: uh-huh 

473.84 475.27 A: you'll be you'll be 

475.63 478.08 A: head and shoulders ahead of everybody else i 

477.13 478.98 B: (( really uh-huh interesting )) 

478.55 484.66 A: went uh i when i graduated from law school i became a newspaper reporter and i was a reporter for a couple of years 

482.41 483.38 B: uh-huh 

483.99 484.97 B: uh-huh 

484.96 489.29 A: and when i went back into law school it was you know i was interested in law 

488.89 489.89 B: uh-huh 

489.40 494.70 A: but it wasn't if if law didn't work out i was going back and be a newspaper reporter because i liked doing that too 

493.81 495.62 B: sure sure okay 

495.06 499.07 A: and that that gave me such an advantage over people 'cause they're 

498.33 499.33 B: uh-huh 

499.14 502.93 A: 'cause so many people go there and their only life goal is to be a lawyer 

502.93 504.10 B: (( that's true )) 

502.96 505.10 A: and some of 'em freak out [laughter]

506.51 511.60 B: i said that's really disappointing there's more to life than your job and your work without a question 

509.76 514.84 A: well that's right that's right but uh well that's that's exciting it's uh 

515.09 518.52 A: have you been accepted yet to go to school or you're still waiting
