147.82 150.61 A: yeah so have you ever been married 

150.43 152.79 B: uh no never been married [laughter] 

155.02 158.43 B: um actually i'm not even sure if i wanna get married 

158.07 159.24 A: [laughter] 

158.65 160.48 B: or have kids 

160.16 161.68 A: oh really 

161.08 162.11 B: yes 

163.09 163.79 B: [laughter] 

163.88 175.63 B: well i know no i know that i'll probably get married i probably just won't have kids i don't know about kids that's a real big iffy i know that people would say when you get older you know what i'm saying 

175.15 177.12 A: mhm 

175.91 181.32 B: getting married and having kids is you know something to look forward to but i'm not looking forward to the kids 

181.34 182.70 A: oh really [laughter] 

181.41 184.64 B: maybe maybe that'll change when i get older 

185.66 187.05 B: i'm not sure 

186.80 190.16 A: so why why is it that you don't wanna have kids 

189.98 191.65 B: [lipsmack] um 

193.22 195.02 B: 'cause i don't think they're 

196.81 197.99 B: [laughter] 

198.51 200.28 B: i i don't know ah 

200.43 201.98 B: (( it's just like )) 

202.07 215.53 B: i think it's too hard and and just like you have to it's kind of selfish but it's selfish but like i wanna just like make sure i'm ready and do all the things that i wanna do first and 

206.75 207.92 A: you mean physically 

215.33 218.82 B: and i think if i had kids uh that'll get in the way and 

218.83 222.72 B: you know what i'm saying i wanna do things on my own time and when you have kids 

218.85 220.07 A: [laughter] 

222.59 235.85 B: not only do you have to worry about that but you have to worry about you know taking care of your kids and like let's just say you get into a situation not only do you have to worry about yourself you have to worry about your kids too and it just makes it hard you know 

236.13 237.46 A: yeah 

236.98 243.10 B: and i don't wanna bring kids into the world and then not able to take care of 'em when something happens and i'm not able to take care of 'em 

244.00 250.13 B: that's just the main biggest reason 'cause i don't wanna bring them into the world then like can't care of 'em [laughter] 

251.42 260.78 A: yeah well i think if there were more people like you then there would be less unwanted kids and less kids fewer kids who were 

260.84 262.95 A: abused and neglected 

262.73 270.11 B: yeah [laughter] 'cause i think that's the worst thing you could do is bring a child into this world and then um you don't take care of 'em 

270.76 272.39 A: (( yep )) 

272.83 283.59 A: i think you're absolutely right and i think a lotta don't think about that a lotta people just have kids just because they're they're physiologically able to have 'em 

282.98 284.96 B: yeah i mean 

283.94 286.90 A: but they're not psychologically 

287.04 288.45 A: willing 

288.85 299.02 A: or in some cases able to take care of them or willing to take care of them so i think it's a bad move to have kids just because you can 

293.19 294.49 B: (( mhm )) 

299.70 302.74 B: not only that some most people they um 

303.10 304.74 B: [lipsmack] they 

304.76 313.13 B: know what it takes to get pregnant and they know what it takes to have kids but they i don't know think they're invisible to it so they don't do anything 

312.97 324.57 B: to you know what i'm saying to not have kids so i think that's another big thing like they don't really worry about it they're like oh whatever happens you know you know it's not gonna happen and the next thing you know they're pregnant 

326.07 328.59 B: i know that's what happens a lotta times 

329.10 330.27 A: yeah 

330.93 340.39 A: i agree and i i think a lotta people do that and they just don't really give it a lotta thought they don't think people don't think as as much about it as as they should 

341.80 347.39 B: like for instance my brother he just got married recently to his wife they went to the courthouse 

347.33 361.77 B: and got married and he's not working so i mean if she got pregnant she says she's gonna get on birth control but they were having sex before she got on birth control [laughter] unprotected sex and now she's pregnant and uh he doesn't have a job so 

361.61 363.47 A: oh my goodness [laughter] 

362.81 375.14 B: so we're like worried about that 'cause it's like oh my god what is oh my god i hope that one thing they don't get divorced and two that's he able to take care of um the child [laughter] 

375.16 385.68 B: so like you know you see a lotta broken homes and he was raised in a broken home so you would think why would you bring a child into this world when you're not you know you're capable of getting a job 

385.62 391.31 B: and working but you're not doing it to support the child or it's even to support your wife 

391.44 393.88 B: his wife is working but he's not [laughter] 

394.05 394.61 A: (( [mn] )) 

395.86 399.94 A: well is it because he just can't find a job you think or [laughter] 

399.24 409.16 B: no he's very smart it's just that he's lazy and doesn't wanna find a job and he's blaming it on his leg he says his leg hurts but he manages to go play basketball 

409.78 411.27 B: every day [laughter] 

411.37 415.88 B: he says his leg hurts and every time his wife tries to tell him about a job 

416.00 424.20 B: he doesn't he doesn't take any consideration of what she's talking about he doesn't wanna listen to what she's talking about i don't know why 

422.70 423.66 A: well 

424.08 426.86 A: she was stupid for marrying him then [laughter] 

426.46 432.62 B: [laughter] i don't know she said he just didn't become this way 'til after they got married 

433.18 445.37 A: yeah right [laughter] well you know that's what everybody tries to pretend when they they they try to act like they don't notice certain things about a person before they got married 

444.85 445.91 B: uh-huh 

445.50 450.78 A: and you know like the person didn't show you any signs of that before they got married 

450.21 451.25 B: uh-huh 

450.83 453.21 A: because they think it makes them look bad 

453.03 454.05 B: (( uh-huh )) 

454.17 461.41 A: you know because that i'm sure a lotta people would go around and say you know she's really stupid for marrying somebody who doesn't wanna work 

460.85 461.72 B: (( uh-huh )) 

461.65 464.87 A: but yet gets her pregnant and marries her 

464.44 465.52 B: uh-huh 

465.04 468.44 A: and is not willing to contribute to the household expenses 

468.25 471.37 B: (( yeah that doesn't make any sense at all )) 

471.90 473.49 B: so i'm hoping he'll learn 

474.56 482.96 B: [laughter] 'cause other than that the child's gonna be in a broken home 'cause that's only gonna last for so long that he doesn't have to and she's taking care of him 

483.66 488.05 A: yeah i don't think she's gonna wanna continue to do that 

487.92 498.97 B: but not only in relationships i think that people you know how they say they don't they didn't know they were like that until they got married i don't think that's true i think a lotta people do show their true colors before they get married too 

499.11 501.42 A: well at least people do give 

501.58 506.36 A: them strong indications of what they're gonna of what what they're like 

505.76 511.20 B: or signs like if somebody's always angry though they'll show that to you if somebody doesn't like 

511.24 516.39 B: you know somebody is angry you'll know before you get married to 'em 'cause you'll know 

516.38 526.40 B: you know a lot of things depends on how far in life they how far in life they are how many friends they have you know if they have like things like that you're gonna know 

526.22 531.33 A: [lipsmack] well if you spend a lotta time around people and you're halfway perspective 

531.75 535.43 A: then i think you you pick up on certain things 

534.83 535.83 B: (( uh-huh )) 

536.51 543.63 A: you know a a person who is perspective who like i think i am i i think i can pick up on certain things about people 

543.65 547.94 A: i tend to be very observant and i notice things that people do and 

547.55 548.43 B: (( [noise] )) 

549.22 554.54 A: little things that people do give a strong indication as to what type of person you're 

554.66 555.78 A: dealing with 

555.44 565.87 B: mhm yeah 'cause and nowadays people uh just like a get a friend and they've they're like if you don't like then [laughter] that's your problem 

565.99 568.34 B: so i don't see how you don't know 

569.19 571.47 A: well i'm i'm with you i 

571.80 579.12 A: i think people almost always show you some sign of their true personality 

579.48 582.89 A: before they get married they don't just totally change on you 

582.70 586.85 B: mhm [laughter] like for instance i have a boyfriend and and by 

586.88 599.89 B: in my like at night i snore and so like normally like a lotta women would not want to snore in front of their boyfriend or whatever [laughter] and they're getting to know them and they don't find out 'til after that the girl snores
