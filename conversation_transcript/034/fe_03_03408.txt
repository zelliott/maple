30.83 40.30 A: if you if you can't talk to them or communicate and you can't feel good with them and you can't feel honest with them you can't feel connected with them 

34.36 35.53 B: mhm 

40.39 43.19 A: [lipsmack] um you don't have a relationship [laughter] 

43.03 47.42 B: no exactly exactly you need to find that soul mate [laughter] 

47.08 53.76 A: yeah you know it's it's a kindred spirit your soul mate and you know you just have to feel like you're one 

54.05 56.54 A: basically in order to make that work 

56.73 65.33 A: if you're on the outskirts and you're going in direction a. and they're going in direct z. um you will never connect [laughter] 

57.02 59.64 B: (( mhm )) 

64.82 76.52 B: exactly [laughter] so what what personality traits do you think that a person has to have if you're going to make it easier for you to connect with them 

65.87 66.65 A: so you 

67.03 68.27 A: definitely have to 

76.75 83.18 B: i mean is it what's the first thing you notice is it their looks is that what would attract you to someone 

82.82 87.86 A: [lipsmack] actually no um what attracts me to a person is how they treat me 

88.86 90.10 B: very very good 

89.09 89.89 A: they 

90.15 94.44 A: they don't i i have never been attracted to a person based on looked it's 

94.66 99.75 A: it's always been how they handled themselves in a conversation with me 

98.46 99.48 B: mhm 

99.93 109.40 A: um well looks don't hurt but [laughter] it's never been the first or foremost factor for me 'cause i've always learned you could have the 

101.97 103.05 B: [laughter] 

109.44 116.23 A: the the you know you could be the prettiest woman or the most handsome man and just not be the best person 

115.87 116.95 B: mhm 

116.29 118.22 A: so um i 

118.51 130.20 A: i um i guess well you know i was a daddy's girl so i i i've never looked for traits that my father had 'cause i always thought well no i don't wanna do that 'cause i don't wanna have a father but 

127.94 129.28 B: mhm 

130.34 132.71 A: o- once i found 

132.93 145.88 A: my mate [lipsmack] um when i found him i decided i wanted someone that was gonna treat me like my father treated my mother or like my grandfather treated my grandmother 

144.74 145.42 B: (( mm )) 

146.01 149.05 A: and that's when i opened my eyes and met him 

149.38 154.61 A: and and i noticed it it had nothing to do with looks as a matter of fact he was totally different 

151.86 152.59 B: (( [mn] )) 

154.48 155.40 A: than 

155.19 160.45 A: every other guy that i had ever dated he he if if you were to say 

156.88 158.64 B: mhm 

160.24 172.83 A: how you know describe the guys that you have dated in your life he would the one that you would say oh he's different and and it's because it i did it solely based on how he treated me he treated me 

165.66 166.67 B: [laughter] 

172.61 186.10 A: like a lady he he he always treated me like a lady to this day he still does he respected me [laughter] but it it was just you know you just get tired of having those relationships that just don't work 

178.19 180.81 B: [mn] that's so sweet [laughter] 

184.89 188.79 B: and playing the games over and over and over again and 

186.78 187.81 A: right 

188.23 192.45 A: so it's like i just i just get i just got tired and 

191.85 192.61 B: mhm 

192.55 195.31 A: it was matter of fact it was i think 

195.74 205.15 A: uh it was what was that point my my grandfather was was uh sick and actually he had just died and my sister and i were walking from the hospital 

205.00 213.40 A: and my grandmother was saying we you know you know how you smell someone's perfume through the wind and we both said oh granny that smells so good 

210.41 211.31 B: mhm 

213.28 222.28 A: and we said where did you get that from and it's like that's the last gift your grandpa bought me and we were like well when was that and it was like sweetie's day and we were like oh we want a man like that 

218.12 219.06 B: mhm 

221.97 223.10 B: [laughter] 

223.30 231.30 A: [laughter] you know so it that's when i i realized that i had been looking for the wrong things all the time i thought 

231.18 241.44 A: i wanted you know someone who had this status or that status or that financial stability or not but all i really wanted was someone who treated me well 

241.72 244.12 A: and and that all of the rest of it came 

244.52 249.67 A: and so it you know it was a life l- learned lesson for a many many year [laughter] 

248.71 249.84 B: (( [mn] )) 

249.96 250.82 B: (( [cough] )) 

250.28 255.98 A: and i i like to when people ask me and they say well how did you guys meet and i say well he ran from me 

256.19 258.42 B: [laughter] 

256.21 261.99 A: excuse me for he did he did [laughter] he ran from for months 'cause 

259.32 260.41 B: [laughter] 

261.91 274.68 A: it it's just that he said he didn't want another relationship with a woman he he wasn't sure about 'cause he had gone through some things so he ran from me and then when i finally was able to stop him he said 

274.64 277.98 A: he had made up in his mind the next time he dealt with 

277.91 291.11 A: uh a serious relationship that person was gonna come to him and he was gonna learn to accept that person for what they brought instead of going out seeking what he thought he wanted so we just both kinda connected that way 

288.15 289.07 B: mhm 

291.26 292.55 A: (( [laughter] it )) 

291.47 292.78 B: that's excellent 

293.11 296.05 B: excellent [laughter] i know that um 

293.16 293.85 A: (( is )) 

296.57 301.80 B: [lipsmack] i've had relationships where i was with that person because i thought you know like 

301.67 315.76 B: oh this is exactly what i want in the guy you know he looks the way i want him to look and and he's this and he's this and he's this because that this is what i've always thought i wanted in a person and it ends up that that's not what you wanted in the person you know 

315.33 316.49 A: right 

315.59 320.88 B: like like things start to go wrong and you're like wait a minute maybe i should've been concentrating more on 

320.89 328.36 B: um i want someone who doesn't take me for granted as opposed to something like i want someone who is you know blonde and or something like that 

323.66 325.03 A: (( right )) 

327.12 328.28 A: uh-huh 

328.38 334.82 B: you know it's the more relationships you are in the more you realize what truly 

334.93 336.87 B: you need to look for in a person 

337.31 341.93 A: do you ever think that you shouldn't have to go through all of that to find what it is you're looking for [laughter] 

340.28 342.03 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

342.38 349.13 A: it it just seems like there should be something that says okay you know better but you make that same mistake 

349.14 359.42 A: a couple of times yeah you do you make it over and over and over again and it's not until you exit from that relationship or that situation that you realize i did it again 

349.50 351.50 B: over and over again [laughter] 

359.24 360.38 B: mhm 

360.00 368.40 A: you know but you don't see it going in and i i still have not figured out why [laughter] why do we do that it's so sorta like one of my 

364.66 365.73 B: [laughter] 

368.25 375.36 A: friends told me that all all ladies have the bad boy syndrome we all wanna bad boy 

373.45 375.32 B: mhm [laughter] 

375.43 382.55 A: but we know that they're no good for us but we want that bad boy and we must have that bad boy 

377.44 379.95 B: exactly exactly 

380.66 381.95 B: the excitement 

383.11 383.90 A: (( hm )) 

383.97 387.97 B: i said the excitement everyone's looking for the excitement 

385.35 387.24 A: yeah oh is that what it is and 

387.47 393.98 A: it's like okay well i've had enough of that excitement it's more heart breaking in in that kind of excitement than the law should allow for 

393.44 394.36 B: [laughter] 

394.29 395.81 A: it's just not cool 

396.17 397.35 A: but you know 

396.20 399.11 B: i think that i think a lotta times women 

399.02 412.50 B: do go for the bad boy but then after they've had their heart broken enough times they're like okay now it's time to settle down and that's when they start looking for the good boys because they always say that bad boys you know you have fun with the good boy you marry 

412.64 413.97 A: yeah 

413.30 415.74 B: so it's kinda like that thing too 

416.02 418.71 A: oh not good we need to write a book 

418.44 420.37 B: [laughter] 

418.65 427.09 A: they know [laughter] let's not do that you know because in your heart you learn especially in your in your childhood tribulations let me see 

426.97 439.66 A: what is it that your instinct is your instinct your heart or your mind i forget that little saying that they say but it's like you know how you say your mind is telling you one thing and your heart is telling you another and there's always the one that always 

431.09 431.78 B: (( mm )) 

439.42 445.17 A: is the truth the one that the instinct that's always the truth that we tend to try to avoid 

445.41 455.99 A: it's all it always leads you right but we don't ever wanna listen to it um you know but as you get older and as you have uh encounter more and more relationships 

449.52 450.90 B: mhm 

455.93 467.52 A: or just in general just relationships in general whether it be um an intimate relationship or not you learn that that that sixth sense or that 

467.39 477.51 A: that funny feeling that you get about a situation day one is generally the same thing that will run you away the last day because you didn't pay attention to it the first day 

476.76 483.47 B: [laughter] you should always listen to your gut and your intuition 'cause it's there telling you something for a reason 

477.93 478.85 A: you know 

480.35 482.51 A: right in uh 

483.14 494.44 A: right exactly i've experienced it time and time again and beat myself up and say i know i know it why did i do it i knew it so it i guess i kinda had that feeling when i met 

489.11 490.04 B: [laughter] 

494.45 501.26 A: um my mate 'cause it's it's like something told me you know to chase him 

496.57 497.52 B: mhm 

501.79 504.62 A: i knew he was running from me [laughter] 

503.60 506.34 B: so was it was it like love at first sight 

506.23 516.24 A: actually it wasn't love at first sight but it was just he was different he was not what i was accustomed to you know after i had 

510.82 511.76 B: mhm 

514.69 517.80 B: something just told you there is special about this guy 

516.91 529.93 A: yeah it was just and and i just couldn't put my finger on it because he wouldn't you know he i guess he wanted to make sure i wasn't a loony tune which i understood but you know but it i had that feeling about him 

525.09 526.66 B: [laughter] 

529.96 531.37 A: immediately 

530.10 531.00 B: and 

531.20 539.69 B: did his his being since you had to follow him so much or or chase him did that do you feel that that made him more attractive to you 

539.95 542.07 A: oh definitely [laughter] 

540.21 543.11 B: more more mysterious [laughter] 

542.57 544.51 A: yes that definitely did 

545.14 554.58 A: but of course i didn't let him know that but um [laughter] yes it definitely did it was it was that that mystique there but by the same token 

547.19 548.52 B: [laughter] 

554.69 561.04 A: he later told me he was feeling the same way he just like since he had been in so many 

561.07 565.04 A: um relationships that had gone awry he wanted to make sure 

563.55 564.26 B: (( mm )) 

565.08 567.49 A: but he felt it you know because 

567.87 575.03 A: l- little did i know he was actually following me around and what had happened was he he would make 

571.35 573.06 B: oh [laughter] 

575.03 577.40 A: he he just turned the tables 

577.26 589.64 A: it seemed like i was chasing him but it was really that he was chasing me [laughter] but he didn't wanna be the one to be you know the chaser so he would just turn the tables you know i was seeing him in in areas and i'm like 

580.51 581.54 B: [laughter] 

584.16 585.15 B: mhm 

589.50 596.12 A: how did where where did he come from you know know i was in the area never didn't see him when i walked in but he would've saw me 

596.40 599.67 A: and he would put himself in the position for me to see him
