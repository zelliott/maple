0.35 2.34 A: hello my name is bill 

0.69 2.65 B: hello this is john 

2.58 6.01 A: oh hi john and my name is bill how are you 

6.16 7.45 B: fine thank you 

8.26 11.89 A: um that's a quite an interesting topic um 

12.28 20.35 A: you know uh [mn] just the term uh life partner for me almost seems to be like a oxymoron uh nowadays 

20.79 28.35 A: i think the only real life partners you have nowadays almost are are pets you know that you acquire as 

28.53 35.01 A: like a dog [mn] at the time when they're puppies and maybe see until their demise but um 

35.08 47.50 A: [lipsmack] you know with uh divorce so prevalent and some people choosing not to get married but i i guess that skirts the issue as to the most important quality what would you say it would be 

48.09 62.26 B: well i'm not about to go out and acquire a galapagos turtle to make sure that i do get a life partner um but i just got married three years ago at the age of uh forty then forty six 

54.44 55.77 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

61.91 63.70 A: congratulations 

63.16 64.82 B: (( and um )) 

64.67 65.99 A: still newlywed 

65.56 68.84 B: to me it was compatibility 

69.33 76.20 B: um finding somebody with the same interests and the same outlook on life 

76.24 80.50 B: and everything else was secondary and uh 

81.02 83.10 B: uh i 

83.27 86.93 B: three years later i am immensely happily married 

86.33 88.91 A: well that's great that's wonderful 

88.99 89.99 A: um 

89.99 93.87 B: but then i had to wait uh oh say uh 

94.27 101.45 B: um [laughter] what twenty six years to get all [mn] get all the sand pounded out of me first 

100.89 108.65 A: [laughter] i take it this was self imposed restraint that uh kept you away from the altar or was this 

107.91 111.10 B: oh i'm not entirely sure 

109.15 110.58 A: or just wisdom 

110.64 114.60 A: [laughter] uh well i've um 

114.90 118.77 A: uh [mn] learned the hard way uh you know i've uh 

118.81 121.23 A: [mn] ventured and tried and uh 

121.34 128.10 A: my marriage now i would say is per- perhaps uh [mn] very successful uh 

128.04 137.43 A: based upon um [lipsmack] lessons i've learned in the past and compatibility of course is uh i i guess a key 

137.77 138.94 A: um [mn] 

139.86 144.78 A: i was one of those who was you know i guess very 

144.74 159.62 A: optimistic about other people and uh was uh inclined to project on to them the same degree of desire and change uh that i found within myself uh believing that 

159.59 171.37 A: if i was willing to change you know so would they be and i ignored that old adage you know accept people exactly as you first encounter them and uh 

171.46 175.84 A: [lipsmack] you know i i find a great deal of truth in that and and if you 

176.09 188.56 A: and if you accept people exactly as as they are and then see them honestly then compatibility even becomes you know more of a of a factor insofar as 

188.76 193.20 A: you know having seen them for what they are and who they are 

193.24 204.12 A: uh it should tell you whether you're going to be compatible or not but you know when you're young and the sap is running uh and uh all those hormones are 

204.13 213.26 A: um [lipsmack] part of the the chemical process uh it interferes with the functioning of the brain you know [laughter] i think uh 

213.19 222.21 A: when the hormones diminish to some degree uh that uh there's a chance for intelligence to enter the fray 

222.35 223.76 A: and uh 

222.87 224.84 B: i have to agree with you 

225.64 238.06 A: and uh i- it's been uh somewhat better an- and um i i i would say my my wife and i you know i i would say we grow in love as time passes because uh 

238.02 244.99 A: we find more and more common that we uphold uh in addition to the same 

245.03 248.81 A: uh i i guess values that both of us uh 

249.10 253.92 A: uh had when we entered uh our our relationship 

254.42 261.21 A: uh wh- what uh when you said compatibility was there anything that was really you know 

261.32 266.17 A: very um [lipsmack] more important to you than other things 

267.66 269.97 B: well um 

270.31 272.18 B: our pastimes 

272.69 273.85 B: um 

273.91 278.94 B: what we like to do when we weren't working um 

280.04 290.08 B: we're both readers we both like to go to literary conventions uh we both like celtic music all this is important as well as a 

290.14 293.84 B: oh a similar perspective on 

294.28 299.91 B: uh society and government uh we're both at heart pretty well jacksonian 

300.03 305.96 B: and um we kind of do have expectations on how other people ought to behave 

305.94 306.89 A: mhm 

306.18 310.35 B: and uh get disappointed when they don't behave 

310.57 312.00 B: and uh 

313.09 324.58 B: [lipsmack] i'm much more pragmatic than she is she's a bit more of an idealist but um it's not to a a great degree and we get along fine 

325.38 330.19 A: yeah uh tha- that that sounds great that sounds great uh 

330.22 333.19 A: [lipsmack] for me i i think it was um 

333.32 337.46 A: [lipsmack] well the spiritual and religious uh those were 

337.76 341.61 A: key issues uh in in my life uh 

341.76 345.48 A: more or less matters uh regarding children 

345.52 346.65 A: um 

346.95 348.23 A: we uh 

348.51 352.30 A: i i guess our financial philosophies were uh 

352.67 356.84 A: i guess were had to be kind of sorted out but uh 

357.24 362.07 A: they're i i guess our personality differences 

362.11 364.26 A: kind of uh helped [mn] 

364.43 367.04 A: i i guess work things out because 

367.06 367.94 A: um 

368.24 377.41 A: al- although we're pretty well matched uh i- i'm still a more dominant personality and but a little bit more experienced than 

377.46 380.45 A: my wife is so she uh 

380.61 386.11 A: yielded and uh i'm glad to say things worked out f- 

386.14 388.08 A: for the most part uh 

388.38 390.94 A: there and um 

391.07 397.80 A: [lipsmack] overall uh it's it's been um um i'd say a very uh good life and uh 

398.30 403.17 A: i like to think of her as as still my bride even though it's um 

403.49 406.29 A: let's see gee it's going on nine years now 

406.66 408.19 A: so um 

406.87 407.92 B: mhm 

408.77 411.74 A: uh i'm grateful for for that uh 

412.01 413.37 A: but um 

413.47 416.54 A: you know it's i i've i 

416.97 420.35 A: i [mn] i've encountered you know um 

420.65 434.34 A: people who who talk about having check list and i use to dismiss that but now you know having gone through my own uh mistakes i'm i'm inclined to believe that you know 

434.43 444.22 A: a check list you know and things for for you to sit down with your proposed spouse and and discuss would be quite a 

444.32 451.93 A: quite a educational process and perhaps one that could avoid some heart heartbreak on both sides uh 

452.23 453.51 A: (( i [mn] )) 

452.66 459.32 B: well ther- there there is a peril of appearing to be too clinical in the process 

459.40 461.97 B: uh the -the shopping list 

462.28 468.72 B: i don't think i ever let leah see my shopping list um and uh i'll i'll 

465.68 469.54 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

468.77 469.60 B: be 

469.63 482.11 B: and and then she was bright enough not to let me see hers but darn it um you do have to work that list which means you have to know what's really important in the first place 

482.44 491.13 A: yeah well y- y- you have to have one you know to to begin with but then um [lipsmack] you know things like um 

491.80 499.30 A: knowing for example um well i i've heard of people really just have great struggles because they're 

499.44 506.61 A: politically different uh and they they can't put their differences aside and it's let 

506.39 514.71 A: that alienation has led you know to to other areas of their personal life and ultimately things just headed south 

515.80 526.40 A: and so i i don't know i i personally think that it's kind of healthy you know i i don't know if [mn] i would necessarily consider it to be clinical 

526.41 528.92 A: but when you consider uh 

528.95 530.77 A: the nature of uh 

531.13 541.06 A: of taking on a life partner and and you know to me that term has i guess more more significance than the term marriage because 

541.25 545.32 A: marriage nowadays you know who knows how long that's going to be 

545.47 546.32 A: uh 

546.59 548.05 A: that uh 

548.06 561.59 A: [lipsmack] uh that that is a a significant step and and some people approach i guess picking out cars with greater forethought than they [laughter] do picking out a the person they're gon- they're gonna be living with 

562.40 569.21 A: so uh i i'm more or less i tend to be analytical and uh 

569.32 576.81 A: i would say that when i look back at my mistakes it was because i didn't happen to exercise that part of my 

576.83 589.45 A: m- my character in you know i [mn] [lipsmack] in in these areas that i was i just became too emotional didn't uh didn't use commonsense so to speak 

590.15 595.94 A: uh [lipsmack] i don't know how how you've s- seen it uh where we've gone through the process 

594.29 599.86 B: well commonsense is just [mn] about the most uncommon thing that that
