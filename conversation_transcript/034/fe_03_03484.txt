21.28 26.76 B: yeah i listened to i believe it's like what's the most trusting in uh new partner i believe 

26.78 29.64 A: was like life partners or something like that

42.89 43.93 A: oh 

44.14 45.72 B: interesting [laughter]

59.35 60.59 B: [laughter] 

64.97 65.93 A: and 

65.04 71.02 B: yeah i'm thinking of the same thing but i think the important thing is like to be close to your uh 

71.01 80.88 B: to your partner so it's like you're not gonna be above him or the other partner might be above you maybe the same education level or the same sort of 

77.96 79.27 A: yeah that's good 

80.90 85.26 B: you will both understand each other that makes your life much easier 

85.72 87.98 B: probably a more promising future 

90.02 101.83 A: [cough] yeah i mean with life partners really you've just gotta like respect each other completely and um just like be willing to make it a life partnership and not let little things bother you 'cause 

101.82 106.50 A: i mean i've seen some of my friends and like their girlfriends they get in these little arguments 

106.57 109.05 A: over really stupid little things i mean 

108.48 109.47 B: (( that's right )) 

110.20 114.13 A: and you're right about equality like it should be equal 

116.82 122.64 B: well in saying that i mean there are other things like mostly it's like some people like 

122.89 126.62 B: (( their religion is different or different culture )) 

127.10 128.41 A: oh yeah 

127.31 129.68 B: a lotta aspects like 

130.32 132.44 B: before you can consider that 

133.19 135.71 A: that's true um 

138.81 146.91 A: yeah i'm i don't know for me i mean it doesn't matter if the person's a different religion from me but um for 

147.01 149.28 A: i guess a lotta people it's really important if 

149.66 151.49 A: you're very serious about religion 

152.48 158.17 B: so what about what do you think like what about the age like before you decide to get a partner 

158.34 160.57 B: do you think age age matters to this 

160.68 164.21 A: um i think it's like you're smarter about it when you're older 

164.40 166.37 B: that's like more wisdom maybe 

166.05 177.51 A: yeah more wisdom and but i mean i i think probably like early twenties like some- some time in the twenties is when you really i think people should get married you know like 

176.83 180.01 B: yeah because you're still young and you're not that 

180.84 189.78 B: i mean you've still got plenty of time ahead and you're not a teenager maybe maybe between twenty and thirty is the best time i guess 

189.96 200.74 A: yeah 'cause you wanna you wanna like still be young when you do it but um you wanna like have enough knowledge to know like what the right decision is 

201.60 208.19 B: (( and there are many things like you know like i don't wanna just get into a short term because )) 

208.31 214.31 B: i'm thinking just like finish my education first maybe buy a house and a car maybe 

214.10 215.30 A: yeah 

214.62 222.98 B: instead of just jumping into it and then you know your life becomes complicated and maybe the problems facing you in the future 

223.36 236.32 A: right yeah um i'm thinking the same thing like 'cause i'm in college right now and i'm planning on going to medical school after college and that that'll take me a long time to get through and i'll i'll be in school for like i don't know 

230.93 231.70 B: yes 

235.75 237.81 B: (( for a doctor is that what you're saying )) 

237.26 239.49 A: yeah for a doctor i wanna become a doctor 

239.30 240.87 B: oh that's a long time 

240.54 248.24 A: yeah so it'll it'll be a long time so it i mean really i'll probably like to have to like wait 'til i'm about thirty or so that i look for a wife 

248.60 252.33 A: but i mean i guess i could look for one before but i mean 

252.46 261.88 A: really it's tough to like stay together like when you have like different life paths like say i'll i'll be a student and she'll be like out of college 

261.65 269.99 A: and working at that time but i mean it can work if you're really devoted to it but it's hard 

263.93 265.57 B: (( yeah that's right that's )) 

269.42 275.31 B: right i'm saying it's like maybe the best time is like when you're ready for it to think of it 

273.84 274.93 A: mhm 

275.30 284.54 B: and instead of just jumping to someone maybe you've promised them in the next year maybe two years from that and just maybe wasting the other person's life too 

284.57 286.13 A: yeah 

285.51 289.71 B: whereas the best like just think of it when you're ready for it 

289.82 299.99 A: mhm yeah it's good to be patient with things like you're saying and not jump not rush into something 

300.17 305.98 B: well i mean the only patience that like the only thing that getting you away from patience is like 

306.27 309.24 B: most of us like can't wait [laughter] 

308.53 311.43 A: yeah i know it's it's hard sometimes i 

310.51 312.73 B: you just can't [laughter] 

312.11 314.09 A: i mean yes 

313.33 316.30 B: it's not an easy thing it's like the way of life 

316.29 317.89 A: yeah

398.39 407.41 B: but it's like uh i'm thinking the lakers are like kind of one of the second team maybe best team or the second best team i guess 

407.06 410.45 A: yeah the the lakers like have won the last three years 

411.04 415.58 A: so i i want them like they've they've won enough i think it's time for another team to win you know

429.14 431.53 B: what other things do you think are important maybe 

431.27 433.34 A: um i think that 

432.57 435.54 B: maybe money money maybe financial 

435.25 445.18 A: yeah financially you definitely have to consider i mean 'cause like i don't know like to raise a family it takes a lotta money you know to support kids 

436.00 437.52 B: (( has to do with it too )) 

446.23 447.48 A: and 

446.43 450.69 B: (( yes well jumping to kids what do you think of kids like do you think )) 

450.70 452.58 B: for sure you'll have some or 

453.05 454.39 B: after a while 

454.41 459.71 A: yeah i mean i i think like after a while like just like after a couple of years of marriage 

459.81 470.43 A: like once once you have a little bit of money like i i think it's good to like whenever like financially like financial stuff plays a big role in deciding when you're gonna have kids 

468.92 469.95 B: that's right 

470.47 475.44 B: and plus it goes to their future too educational future and house maybe 

475.59 476.47 A: yeah 

475.65 478.55 B: (( financial needs too it's like it's not an easy especially if )) 

479.07 480.71 B: you're so young it's like 

481.17 483.04 B: like uh a lot of years in

527.25 528.08 A: (( like )) 

527.49 528.14 B: yes 

528.28 535.13 A: it would have to be like a very similar background i think like i think it's good to like 

531.94 532.88 B: (( that's right )) 

535.38 542.86 A: um interact with people with different backgrounds so you learn about different about things like different cultures that you've never 

542.90 545.10 A: learned about before i don't um

560.61 569.21 A: fun for me and i guess a wife like that i mean i think i'd enjoy that but i mean i don't know 

569.39 573.17 B: well i think you're right but i'm saying i mean i remember 

575.19 579.52 B: like ten twelve years back there in the middle east it's like people just
