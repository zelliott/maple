8.25 9.51 B: oh okay 

9.51 10.41 A: [laughter] 

9.85 15.46 B: that that's a that's an interesting topic to talk about like oh okay that could be answered so many ways 

14.92 21.08 A: in so many ways right um so what do you think are you married or 

20.21 21.31 B: no uh 

21.58 31.42 B: but like what i look for is like the first things are christianity i mean 'cause i'm a very religious person so that that's definitely a major and then the second i look for is intelligence 

31.46 32.45 A: mhm 

31.60 38.41 B: and then the third you know would be personality i mean i'm not just jumping on looks i mean it's like looks are great

45.91 50.42 B: (( yeah oh they definitely help i never said they don't help [laughter] 'cause oh )) 

46.18 50.61 A: partner definitely not [laughter] um but 

50.54 61.41 A: it's funny with well it's not funny but um it's interesting that you mention religion because i was actually grown up with a um jewish father and a christian mother russian orthodox mother 

61.33 66.88 A: so when it comes to religion um i'm more of i'm amenable i'll convert 

67.15 73.68 A: if my husband or if my life partner would like me to do that or you know i don't i don't really discriminate based on 

73.81 77.63 A: religion but intelligence is definitely key for me definitely key 

77.59 79.43 B: (( yeah you don't want a guy that's dumb [laughter] )) 

79.56 80.72 A: [laughter] 

79.67 93.55 B: you know but you know when it's like what are you talking about what but that's that's interesting you talked about the like the religion thing is that like because you know you and your partner whatever you choose like you wanna raise the kid the same or is that is that is that why it's like important to 

83.18 84.25 A: [laughter] 

91.48 93.07 A: i would um 

93.87 105.70 A: i would like my child yeah because the way i was brought up with two and then kind of a you know here you reach the age why don't you choose confusion i would like my child to grow up with faith with a faith 

93.92 95.33 B: to pick that 

105.55 111.16 A: specifically so yeah so if my husband has a faith i'd be much more willing to 

105.95 107.21 B: oh okay 

111.28 113.69 A: to convert to that than you know 

113.82 116.38 A: have a child do the same 

116.46 123.21 A: weird type of you know hanukkah christmas and then russian christmas type of thing [laughter] that i did in my house 

121.46 122.64 B: (( oh okay )) 

123.27 129.42 B: and you mentioned like you're in college or something 'cause i have like a college degree and i'm working on my second one that's why like intelligence is important to me 

129.63 138.17 A: i am exactly exactly i can't imagine being able you know as you said just sitting round and having a conversation with someone who's just like [mn] [laughter] 

137.58 148.97 B: yeah kinda like you mentioned like the religion thing it's like what's real important to me and i don't know why people do this nowadays it's like [sigh] you know they say well i'm saving up money for my kid's college it's important they go to college and it's like well why you didn't 

148.87 157.16 B: i mean you're supposed to set an example and i want me and my husband to set the example for the kid about going to college i mean granted our parents are a different generation not a lot of 'em went 

153.91 155.06 A: mhm 

157.18 159.85 B: and our grandparents not a lot of them went 

157.59 158.52 A: right 

159.91 161.51 A: but of course if 

160.56 168.94 B: but i'm like yeah like why it's like this one girl she was in my my accounting class and she's the smartest person in the class and [lipsmack] she said um 

169.02 181.87 B: i mean so she said she wanted to be a stay home mom and raise five kids and somebody said well why are you getting a college degree she says because when i you know have children both me and my husband can say 'it's important for you to go to college' and our kids can't say 'why you didn't' 

182.51 183.54 A: [laughter] 

182.52 190.63 B: so that's like yeah that's like important to me in a partner like one guy really liked me but he only had associates degree well i'm working on my master's 

189.16 189.98 A: oh 

190.42 192.35 A: oh congratulations 

191.72 194.16 B: oh thanks you know it's real fun [laughter] 

192.65 203.71 A: no i i definitely i definitely agree because you want to be able to give your your children as many opportunities as you possibly can and you want a husband who has that same type of sacrifice or 

203.61 208.88 A: um same type of of thought that he would sacrifice to be able to give the children that education or 

208.93 210.31 B: yeah you know what 

208.98 215.22 A: save up and that 'cause i really but it really like um changes your your financial priorities too 

214.55 222.10 B: yeah and and you don't wanna have to be the one to explain it to your kid it's just like well you know i went to college 'cause of this you know yes your father didn't you know 

222.07 233.47 B: and then come to me for all the college questions you know it's like it's both those people raising so it's like when you pick a mate you have to have something that they're gonna help each other raise a kid together not like be 

224.75 225.51 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

233.35 242.78 B: fighting against each other like you know okay you're that religion and i'm not you know i don't believe in what your father believes in or i don't you know agree with your father's thing about education 

239.98 241.05 A: (( exactly you )) 

241.31 249.06 A: wanna be able to talk with one voice and one moral voice and [laughter] you know one one guiding voice for the most part 

249.08 255.85 B: yeah kids have a hard enough time growing up as it is and it keeps getting worse the world so you don't need to be like fighting in their own family 

249.23 250.83 A: (( i definitely agree with that )) 

252.47 253.57 A: [laughter] 

253.80 254.74 A: exactly 

256.12 257.17 A: exactly 

256.31 257.29 B: but like 

257.40 264.59 B: what about like kids like are you gonna like pick a man that's not sure or to me it's important that they're on the same wavelength for kids too 

264.21 276.48 A: i yes i agree that they're the same wavelength but i actually was just put in um a a little peculiar situation and that 'cause i'm i'm young i'm only twenty two but i just found out that um i'm most likely infertile 

273.10 273.86 B: uh-huh 

276.54 290.86 A: which was a i just found out about that so that's a shock but so for me there i mean there's drugs probably you know treatments in ten years or so so now i'm left with the choice you know um what life partner you know 

276.67 277.53 B: (( oh okay )) 

286.19 286.97 B: uh-huh 

290.93 292.03 A: um 

292.20 300.11 A: would you would have to explain that to your life partner and so my choice might actually be less because i definitely would not expect anyone 

300.17 306.24 A: you know to um get married based on love if there's no kids [laughter] 'cause that's important 

305.35 311.69 B: oh okay yeah that's kind of important to be on the same wave- uh you don't like surprise him after you get married like oh by the way 

306.49 307.40 A: (( you know )) 

310.72 317.68 A: no by the way [laughter] how do you feel about in vitro fertilization [laughter] you know but someone's gotta be 

312.87 314.11 B: yeah 

315.17 321.83 B: yeah but it's like if if the guy's on board like oh that's okay or you know we can adopt or 

319.49 331.68 A: yeah or i'm willing to like yeah exactly we can adopt or i'm willing to wait for you know new treatments to come through or i'm willing to spend the money on in vitro i mean that's important that's important as well so 

331.44 341.64 B: so like you're looking for a guy that's like willing to agree that's just important right 'cause it's like some people are just like yeah we'll get married and we'll figure it out later it's like i want to have all this stuff figured out beforehand 

338.35 339.28 A: (( yeah i )) 

340.24 344.70 A: know yes i need this stuff figured out now 'cause i want some sort of tone mm 

344.84 353.98 B: yeah like i'm kinda dating this one guy now and he keeps talking about well i think you're the one and meet my parents and everything i'm like well we gotta be on the same wavelength about when to meet 'em 

353.10 354.00 A: mhm 

354.02 360.38 B: 'cause it was like we did christian dating where we just courted each other for a month and a half you know every we'd always 

358.69 360.00 A: (( mhm mm )) 

360.17 371.65 B: couples and i i needed a guy that that work wants to work with this and you know it it's like we read a book about dating it says going against the grain of cultures that's what i'm looking for about a guy who 

371.68 386.63 B: you know has the same morals and values and christianity that i have because like me and him discuss like if we can't then we can't find that in a mate if we're gonna be disagreeing about how to date when to get married and when to meet the parents 

381.64 382.84 A: exactly 

385.78 387.61 A: (( mhm now )) 

386.58 390.14 B: and his he wanted me to meet the parents two weeks after we started dating 

390.18 392.16 B: [laughter] so i'm like whoa 

390.33 391.45 A: (( oh )) 

391.99 395.11 A: so that doesn't go with with christian dating mm 

395.07 407.34 B: well uh we kinda did it like old fashioned like i like old fashioned like english courting 'cause when you say american courting everybody thinks oh that's marriage and it's like oh no no we're talking english courting [laughter] where it's just you know we're we're just getting to know each other because 

403.18 404.71 A: [laughter] 

407.47 416.78 B: the value i look for in a man it's like you know we it the people on the date are me him and god and that's only what we wanna focus on for three months 

414.14 414.83 A: mhm 

417.36 428.00 B: and other people you know don't focus on that and that's totally fine and i so totally respect other people like my one friend just started dating a guy right away and i'm like hey that's great congratulations 'cause that's her 

417.38 418.69 A: (( [lipsmack] for three months )) 

422.94 423.78 A: right 

427.69 431.14 A: but that's her and her values and her morals so yeah i 

430.13 441.74 B: yeah and she's got values and morals you know galore but it's like our time frames are different so but i'm like but that's her and that's totally fine 'cause that's what she wants so i'm looking for a guy that wants what i what i want 

439.14 440.00 A: mhm 

441.81 442.75 A: mhm 

442.53 449.10 B: and you know we waited the three months so it was important for me to you know we didn't even hold hands or kiss for three months 

449.22 454.09 A: okay did you is that something that you normally um you lay out right at the beginning 

449.32 450.96 B: and that was important that he 

454.22 455.05 A: or 

454.23 468.54 B: yeah i mean we kind of we talked about this when we were just kinda courting and not even dating like because it's important for me if i'm looking for a man to talk about what i want in a relationship before i get in a relationship 'cause lots of times guys like 

465.68 466.56 A: right 

466.66 469.13 A: so there's no surprises and yeah 

468.59 478.52 B: yeah 'cause i figure i don't wanna put my heart and soul into it if we're not compatible i mean you know he's compatible with somebody else if i'm looking for like a life mate then 

473.21 474.47 A: exactly 

478.85 484.35 B: i wanna know beforehand like if he's gonna try to kiss me on the first date or go to bed with me on the first date i'm like 

483.10 495.12 A: that's something that you'll just be uncomfortable and won't wanna be with yeah at least um what about if someone is if the the man he's not normally like that but he definitely respects you and agrees to do that for three months that's okay 

485.42 486.67 B: yeah 

486.93 488.25 B: i'm like that 

495.17 502.23 B: yeah 'cause the guy i'm dating now he's like i i like that i wanna start doing that so he's never done it with another girl before he's waited like a month 

499.30 500.12 A: (( okay )) 

500.90 503.20 A: oh well that's good 

502.36 506.84 B: yeah waited like a month you know to kiss a girl before but he's never waited three months 

507.31 511.10 A: mm now why did you pick three months is that just an in 

507.55 508.44 B: (( so )) 

509.78 519.53 B: i'm like well it's kinda like i don't know it's just kind of a general term it's like you kinda get rid of the lovey dovey feelings in about three months everybody's always oh three months later he left 

513.65 514.56 A: mhm 

517.28 518.34 A: right 

519.75 520.96 B: so i guess that's 

520.00 520.91 A: now this 

521.02 524.05 A: this might sound oh sorry [laughter] go ahead 

521.03 521.97 B: kinda like 

523.60 524.37 B: huh 

524.43 525.30 B: (( [mn] )) 

524.66 531.82 A: um this might sound a little uh a little odd for me to ask but is that standard or there's is christian dating a 

532.10 535.02 A: uh standard term that people generally know 

535.04 549.69 B: um unfortunately like a a lot of christians don't um they say they're christians um christian date but they don't really there's a lot of good books that explore like everything i'm saying you know so it's so it is kinda common it's not like oh this book was written just for me and this guy 

535.08 537.00 A: (( what you're talking about when you say it mm )) 

546.95 547.97 A: mhm 

550.30 552.70 B: so it just kinda builds on like 

552.93 558.18 B: don't base a relationship on lovey dovey stuff just kind of put that aside 'cause we didn't hold hands or 

556.79 558.43 A: get the friendship going 

558.32 565.17 B: yeah we we didn't hold hands or kiss or anything 'cause your emotions get involved with that we just like you know 

558.61 559.41 A: right 

562.75 563.76 A: mhm 

563.96 571.29 A: this really sets it up for the long term 'cause if you make it through the three months you're really you've really got a partner you've got a friend 

566.72 567.72 B: yeah 

570.81 577.92 B: yeah definitely 'cause um a lot of christian books choices and the ten commandments of dating do give like that three month period 

577.61 578.51 A: mhm 

578.44 587.69 B: but you know i know a lot of my christian friends who don't do the three month period and that's totally fine but then you know i look at my relationships and i'm like yeah but you know i didn't 

581.96 582.94 A: mhm 

586.27 588.82 A: they've turned out pretty well yeah [laughter] mm 

587.97 599.95 B: yeah they've turned out pretty well i mean it's like i used to work in a church and only date ministers so minister it's like oh okay so ministers kind of i don't know i guess it's an automatic thing when they sign up to be a minister they have to wait
