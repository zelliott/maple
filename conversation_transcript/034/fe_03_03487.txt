61.19 62.22 B: oh wow 

61.98 69.57 A: but um i obviously dated and and things before um i decided to propose to my wife 

65.70 66.65 B: uh-huh 

69.58 81.05 A: but um i knew that my wife was the one that um that i would want to marry for several reasons one she was a a member of the church and i thought that was pretty important 

73.98 75.13 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

77.18 77.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

80.79 81.59 B: (( mm mm )) 

81.16 83.40 A: the second she um [lipsmack] 

85.09 97.47 A: she has a lot of similar beliefs as far as uh raising children she also wanted to have uh a a family and that was important to her and she wanted to put them first over a career 

93.13 94.26 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

97.77 99.15 A: um 

99.54 100.81 A: and 

101.12 103.14 A: third let's see 

102.44 103.37 B: (( [noise] )) 

104.23 110.47 A: she uh she's not a materialistic person and i'm a teacher we're both teachers actually so 

109.79 111.12 B: oh interesting 

110.65 117.11 A: i had ruled out actually uh another girl that i had dated before um i left on my mission 

117.26 118.30 A: um 

118.51 120.02 B: (( [noise] )) 

124.14 125.82 B: (( oh go ahead sorry )) 

124.92 130.41 A: okay yeah so i had kinda ruled out this other girl just because she had these big dreams of like 

130.48 141.68 A: you know opening up a a store and going to france and living on the east coast and all that stuff and so i i just didn't think that like materialistically we would work out 

135.58 136.48 B: mhm 

141.71 144.06 A: as well so that was another factor 

143.76 145.13 B: yeah 

144.45 145.44 A: um 

145.67 151.81 A: and i got some advice one time that that the person that that i should marry should love me 

152.00 156.81 A: and it sounds silly but like i i mean it doesn't sound silly but what what i mean is 

157.33 170.63 A: it sounds so obvious that that you think you would think a- about that right away but i kind of like made this little list of qualities that i wanted in a spouse but i didn't have that fact that she should love me you know 

166.52 167.71 B: (( [noise] mhm oh )) 

171.15 174.31 A: but that was the case and so 

174.41 176.56 A: i proposed and we're married now 

177.63 180.03 A: are you single or married 

178.98 181.55 B: that's uh no i'm seeing someone right now 

181.21 182.52 A: oh yeah 

181.81 183.41 B: yeah she's um 

183.96 189.76 B: not casually it's like been my first real like substantial relationship 

189.27 190.23 A: uh-huh 

190.26 191.38 B: (( and uh )) 

191.88 197.76 B: oh no she's i mean she's definitely like a prospect i mean she's very um i've never met someone so genuine 

198.04 202.63 B: in my life and i really appreciate that i'm a very simple person 

199.16 200.04 A: uh-huh 

203.20 217.91 B: and uh as much as it's very hard in los angeles to to find someone that's simple and you know not complicated and you know she's very down to earth she's not materialistic you know doesn't really care about like what she wears or 

213.95 214.91 A: uh-huh 

217.93 221.00 B: you know when i'm driving and all that 

220.41 222.37 A: yeah 

221.45 227.74 B: and we kind of grew up together too so i kind of understand like where she's coming from with her background 

227.16 228.07 A: uh-huh 

227.85 237.68 B: so i don't know i mean right now i'm just you know i'm fine with what i what we have right now but i mean i i can't help to to have like thought about it in the past yeah 

237.93 238.85 A: uh-huh 

239.00 253.17 A: that's interesting that you mentioned being simple because um my wife and i both don't have a car we walk everywhere take the bus and we live in a basement apartment and so really our only expense is my tuition every semester 

248.25 249.42 B: (( oh yeah )) 

251.89 254.07 B: oh wow oh so you're at school too 

253.94 254.98 A: pardon 

254.65 255.89 B: you're in school 

255.30 260.47 A: yeah i'm still a a student i'm in the master's program in linguistics here at b. y. u. 

260.27 262.51 B: oh b. y. u. okay very good school 

262.04 265.04 A: yeah uh and for linguistics it's pretty 

262.90 263.68 B: yeah 

265.03 266.05 B: (( linguistics )) 

265.19 266.53 A: (( good )) 

266.12 269.64 B: i'm a i'm an undergrad psych student this is my senior year 

269.44 271.95 A: oh yeah good 

270.02 271.16 B: yeah 

272.38 277.92 A: um so like we yeah that being simple is definitely [laughter] a plus 

277.34 279.21 B: (( that's cool yeah )) 

279.09 288.10 A: i don't think that's something that people talk about a lot you know they they talk more about you know you should have the same cultural background or religious beliefs or financial 

287.80 289.44 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

288.33 291.16 A: goals or something but usually not 

293.11 297.77 A: i don't know whether or not you think driving a b. m. w. is important or not you know [laughter] [mn] 

297.87 298.72 A: (( so )) 

302.03 304.25 A: any other qualities you look for in 

303.73 305.87 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

304.74 307.65 A: how 'bout physical beauty like is that a big 

306.72 310.16 B: i mean well that's definitely like i was saying you know you gotta if 

310.17 314.04 B: you're gonna live with that person for a long time you gotta um 

314.40 317.10 B: you know you gotta be attracted to them 

316.42 317.34 A: uh-huh 

317.74 320.37 B: and you know like what you see 

321.58 322.48 A: okay 

322.48 328.97 B: yeah but i mean she you know you know takes care of that [laughter] pretty well i mean i'm i'm pretty uh 

324.87 325.43 A: (( [cough] )) 

329.33 331.31 B: she's a good looking girl 

332.07 333.03 B: and uh 

333.76 340.28 B: yeah i like simple beauty you know i like someone i i guess like without you know all the make up and she doesn't wear make up at all 

339.91 340.84 A: uh-huh 

340.70 341.81 B: so um 

342.15 343.87 B: you know that's that's cool 

343.62 349.89 A: yeah that's interesting 'cause a lotta guys would disagree with you but i i actually agree i i much prefer when women don't wear make up 

349.63 356.28 B: yeah i mean i guess because my mother's kind of like that way my mother wears make up like occasionally 

352.97 353.86 A: uh-huh 

355.86 356.73 A: uh-huh 

356.55 362.21 B: but um you know she's a very simple lady doesn't take much you know low maintenance 

363.63 365.17 A: mhm 

366.34 367.52 A: [lipsmack] i see 

367.67 370.47 A: another thing that um what's important to me 

371.20 377.43 A: just kind of important not terribly important but my wife doesn't really watch t. v. and i i didn't even own a t. v. so 

377.16 378.31 B: oh really 

377.71 382.45 A: yeah i just think there's so many better things to do [laughter] with your time and so 

381.10 382.50 B: (( oh really that's interesting )) 

382.76 385.84 A: so that's kind of a a good thing we had in common 

384.18 397.14 B: yeah i i it our life yeah i mean we watch t. v. i guess we're not i mean i don't have cable or anything and i kinda understand about the basement apartment thing 'cause i live in a basement apartment [laughter] as well 

391.05 391.97 A: uh-huh 

396.81 397.74 A: uh-huh 

397.26 403.08 B: and um i don't know too many girls who'd be who would be like too excited to hear that 

403.11 404.78 B: especially here
