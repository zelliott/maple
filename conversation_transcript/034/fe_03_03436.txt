10.64 13.30 B: nice to meet you life life partners 

11.99 13.26 A: nice to meet you too 

13.87 15.61 B: what do you look for in a life partner 

13.90 15.09 A: yes 

16.40 17.59 A: um 

19.24 21.68 A: uh my biggest thing would be uh 

21.79 24.19 A: sensitivity and compassion i guess 

24.60 30.04 A: besides the fact i mean obviously you got to have some sort of attraction to them but i figured that would kind of 

30.94 33.58 A: [noise] make everything uh a lot easier 

33.94 34.99 A: (( what about you )) 

35.03 38.08 B: uh trust and recognition 

39.42 40.35 A: pardon me 

40.17 42.19 B: trust and recognition i 

42.94 44.03 A: yes 

43.21 48.21 B: think what what i mean from my o- own personal experiences i think with uh 

48.63 62.05 B: um [sigh] if um trust i don't just mean trust from a fidelity perspective but trust in terms of confidence that uh uh the person's going to be there the person will indeed on [mn] even on occasions challenge um 

54.47 55.50 A: mhm 

62.12 74.97 B: um to to help help you get some perspective that's what's valuable uh in a life partner uh the recognition being the same thing about you know recognizing ea- ea- each each individuality but uh 

74.76 76.69 A: right 

75.32 76.47 B: working together 

76.82 80.21 A: oh yeah i was about to ask you if you could elaborate on recognition 

80.93 87.78 B: ba- basically about it kind of recognizing each each other we're recognizing each other's strengths you're recognizing 

88.26 96.12 B: um [sigh] each other as you know both individuals but both trying to work together for um for each other's benefit 

97.05 98.07 A: (( oh i see )) 

99.18 103.12 A: yeah i i guess [noise] are you are you married by any chance 

103.18 105.24 B: divorced somewhere in 

104.66 105.71 A: oh okay 

105.42 107.33 B: along that line uh 

107.94 110.24 B: [mn] like i say it was an absence of 

110.41 112.22 B: uh of of of 

113.05 114.59 B: and uh then also 

115.39 120.16 B: strange ways as well um so uh uh 

120.48 122.88 B: yeah that's very important to me in terms of 

123.38 125.75 B: having somebody who um 

125.79 128.04 B: could um uh 

127.91 128.67 A: (( [noise] all )) 

128.08 130.22 B: help in terms of provide perspective 

131.32 135.39 B: and that that perspective you also can then develop shared goals 

131.41 132.33 A: right 

135.48 136.64 B: um 

136.74 144.01 B: and i think it's a case of it maybe difficult to [mn] to provi- to to develop shared goals but the shared goals can exist and us both recognize 

144.47 145.77 B: what each other 

146.20 148.80 B: is are can be would be sharing mhm 

148.05 154.88 A: right i see what you're saying yeah yeah [mn] i don't know i just i guess i'm a 

154.92 156.48 A: idealist by nature 

156.57 158.24 A: and so i kind of 

159.29 160.67 A: i just figure 

160.70 167.01 A: [mn] i don't know i've never been like you know i'm not nowhere close to getting married or any time soon at least 

167.02 169.07 A: uh but uh 

169.09 172.67 A: i guess the qualities that i uh like most about the 

172.80 176.40 A: girls i've dated are you know have been interested in or 

176.54 178.77 A: any of those things like 

178.78 181.48 A: to me like sensitivity too 

181.72 196.32 A: is like a pretty big thing [mn] 'cause a lot of people can just be really careless and inconsiderate about things and it just [noise] halts a lot if you know people are considerate and sensitive to what's going on around them instead of just themselves 

183.35 184.15 B: mhm 

196.58 197.61 A: so 

197.61 198.41 B: mhm 

197.84 199.45 A: uh to me it's one of the 

200.03 203.72 A: uh more important like you know qualities uh personally 

203.54 204.33 B: mhm 

204.49 205.53 A: (( but )) 

206.11 207.54 A: (( [cough] i don't know it's kind of )) 

206.52 210.00 B: yeah i think the the wh- wh- what i'm talking about is 

210.37 214.03 B: evolves um after 

214.63 217.59 B: somebody can be sensitive someone can be sensitive 

214.99 215.88 A: (( pardon me )) 

218.37 222.66 B: um and that's may be part of a recognition ultimate type of situation 

222.09 224.06 A: right right right 

222.98 233.25 B: the the the the the the taking of a life partner be is basically kind of kicking in is when you have indeed found somebody who uh kind of syncs up with you 

224.33 226.22 A: yeah 

233.78 234.68 B: but 

234.79 238.46 B: who and who also uh has made a logical 

238.57 251.06 B: kind of shifting from the emotional to the logical of not only do i sync up with you but i want to make an effort to sync up with you because by in large we only sync up with somebody incidentally 

246.72 247.84 A: [noise] 

251.11 252.67 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

251.50 263.43 B: and we then will either we will we're always changing so it's a case of making a commitment to maintain a syncing with an expectation that we will both change adapt and grow together 

254.89 256.21 A: right 

262.68 269.06 A: right and that's the biggest thing 'cause anything can happen in your life which is going to make you change your ways the way you know 

269.16 272.51 A: and you're right a person has to be able to adapt 

272.54 279.61 A: uh to you and you know your potential changes that you are going to have and yeah um 

279.72 280.97 A: (( it's )) 

281.84 287.48 A: i guess to me like it was one of those things that i i didn't really think about but it makes total sense 

287.60 293.07 A: um that you have to be willing to do that 'cause you know not everybody stays uh 

293.52 296.44 A: stagnant uh all the way through [laughter] so 

296.48 298.88 A: uh definitely very important [noise] right 

297.15 301.29 B: no basically you don't want that i mean you basically want to both be able to 

301.40 307.34 B: adapt and grow change is cha- change is a constant um and it's a case of 

307.54 310.45 B: [mn] you're committing with a life partner to uh 

310.59 319.88 B: to indeed work together and it's not going to be perfect but uh the the the work together in making that change uh works for uh a mutual benefit if you will 

320.68 335.59 A: so what do you think about the stereo like i've heard a lot about like arranged marriages and stuff in different cultures and what do you think about you know and the statistics based uh supposedly show that actually they do show that the divorce rates are much lower 

335.67 338.00 A: for arranged marriages and they are 

336.78 345.79 B: yeah i think there there there are two parts of that basically there's there there's there's one that the perception of what divorce is in those types of situations much like if 

343.99 348.56 A: right if it's accepted in the culture if it's okay to do it then that's a big part of like 

348.61 359.13 B: well then the the the reason [mn] divorce happens in this country is not because of um uh people are are um um you know 

359.30 365.97 B: less willing to commit nearly as much as people are less willing to commit because the stigma of divorce is gone 

366.20 367.17 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

366.20 370.09 B: uh in an arranged marriage situation two things happens one there's a stigma 

370.60 376.76 B: two and it's part of the stigma as well that there's a syncing up of we've got to make this work 

377.24 386.71 B: a typically the that's somewhat of of of an imbalance because typically those arranged marriage situations it's a male dominated type situation 

377.42 378.39 A: right 

379.65 380.44 A: (( [noise] )) 

386.80 389.08 A: right right 

387.60 393.52 B: which then the whole idea of what the support roles of the wife are are clear 

393.50 394.63 A: mhm 

393.66 403.97 B: and just maybe one of the things that's happened in our society that the the the role of husband and wife having changed we lack the benchmark we lack the guides 

403.92 411.78 B: to how things are supposed to be so we got kind of have to make it work as we go along which is another factor i think that's contributed to divorce 

404.11 404.99 A: right 

405.91 406.80 A: right 

408.90 410.15 A: mhm 

411.63 419.41 B: because you can't point to it's more difficult to point to examples of see they're doing it they made it that's the way things are supposed to be 

419.34 420.86 A: right exactly 

419.94 421.35 B: typically 

421.85 434.42 B: there a there are few of those b. when they happen because they're so few and they're they they they are therefore varied uh it becomes very difficult to compare yourself to that um so um 

434.62 435.64 B: yeah i mean 

435.83 438.86 B: part of an arranged marriage situation [mn] it's expected 

438.93 442.11 B: that you're going to sync up and i think also the case of 

441.41 442.64 A: (( [noise] )) 

442.36 446.56 B: you know you come together in a marriage situation okay let's sync up so that there's a 

445.88 446.84 A: [noise] 

446.60 448.73 B: commitment to do that 

449.43 457.86 B: which i don't think happens in a lot of people in in because you know it's a case of [mn] the the the romance according has taken taken a different path 

457.79 459.34 A: (( [noise] )) 

460.43 463.96 B: so that that's what i see as the difference in that regard [mn] 

461.49 462.49 A: [noise] 

463.95 466.79 A: right no it makes total sense 

467.51 468.65 A: it's um 

469.16 471.90 A: it's 'cause i don't like my parents for example 

472.63 475.26 A: they had an arranged marriage but um 

475.52 488.92 A: if they were in a culture where divorce was something that was you know accepted and since it was okay to do it they would have been divorced years ago [laughter] but you know it's like it's one of those things which since there's you know 

489.26 500.33 A: the society like what they think of you is such a big deal enough that you should be miserable for like you know half of your life um that they do it 

497.07 499.43 B: in extreme cases like that no 

499.99 504.90 B: in in in extreme cases like that i can see that as well but if there is something to be said that 

504.84 516.11 B: um a stigma against divorce that make that puts you in a miserable situation does provide at least a stimulus to say at some for some people in some situations we got to work this out 

516.26 518.20 A: right i i guess 

516.98 519.53 B: (( there are you know people also who )) 

519.62 526.47 B: um basically went down the path of divorce because divorce was an option 

526.65 527.76 A: mhm 

526.73 533.83 B: if divorce wasn't an option there might have been a greater desire willingness and commitment to work things out before it went down the path you 

534.03 535.13 A: mhm 

534.25 535.33 B: (( see what i'm saying )) 

535.28 538.41 A: yeah yeah 

537.32 544.03 B: so but at the same time you've also got the case where you know if if it ain't gonna no matter what it ain't gonna fit ain't gonna happen 

544.05 545.76 A: right exactly 

544.31 545.68 B: (( um you open )) 

546.19 548.21 B: a whole other can of worms there 

547.81 554.70 A: yeah yeah [sigh] yeah i don't know um [lipsmack] looks it's definitely a 

554.85 562.15 A: it's just the word life partner's kind of scary [laughter] just 'cause like it's a pretty big commitment to kind of finally 

562.39 565.09 A: you know come to that to me um 

565.51 568.69 A: i've definitely not met a person well uh 

569.15 570.76 A: (( i couldn't even imagine )) 

570.94 572.70 A: life partners but i guess 

573.10 576.53 A: you're supposed to meet them someday right so [laughter] 

577.31 578.19 B: well that 

577.39 577.96 A: (( [mn] )) 

578.29 580.13 B: that's the goal yeah 

579.53 583.94 A: yeah yeah do you feel like it's uh 

581.63 583.03 B: when it comes down to 

585.06 587.02 A: it's [mn] i mean obviously you know 

588.70 589.84 A: that's what 

589.95 599.95 A: that's why you have like uh in our species like different sexes to kind a you know promote the species but do you think there'll ever come a point a time in society where
