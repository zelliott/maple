69.51 70.70 A: oh okay 

70.17 73.40 B: so i guess we're supposed to talk about minimum wage 

72.70 75.16 A: [laughter]

89.51 96.53 A: and right right yeah 'cause they have yeah yeah go ahead i i agree what you were saying about the five fifteen 

92.71 94.19 B: that's strange though 

96.78 102.77 B: yeah that's you know out here in california it's six seventy five so it's i don't know what it is in maryland 

102.01 114.59 A: well in maryland gee i don't know either i think it might be five seventy five i'm not sure but still um unless unless somebody you're living at home with your parents five seventy five is still i mean it's 

114.53 117.39 A: it's nothing how you afford a car 

117.63 121.56 B: i'm sorry oh i know of course 

118.75 122.41 A: insurance you know with with the minimum yeah like 

122.11 123.67 B: how do ya afford to eat 

123.20 125.66 A: yeah and here is expensive 

125.44 133.17 B: oh i know i heard maryland's very expensive back east is you know and there's a lot of uh ritzy areas out there too 

127.19 129.57 A: (( yeah yeah you've got [noise] )) 

132.67 134.21 A: yeah yeah 

133.59 140.98 B: you know and then there's a lot of i think tourism so that even makes it more expensive so the capital's near 

137.74 145.31 A: right right right yeah it is but you can't get no if you were gonna to get an apartment forget that five dollars an hour 

145.27 147.60 B: oh yes especially in california too 

145.64 147.09 A: [laughter] 

147.57 149.65 A: yes i hear california 

148.54 150.48 B: anywhere really 

149.66 151.71 A: (( yeah that's what i'm saying how do people )) 

150.54 152.49 B: even the slums you know 

151.84 154.11 A: (( how do people do it over there )) 

153.97 165.16 B: well i think you know what um people i think a lotta people are just resourceful and they have parents helping them and they have relatives and they and they do things on the side 

160.86 162.08 A: you see 

163.73 167.17 A: but that's what i'm saying because i mean god people mm 

165.93 176.79 B: or they live together i mean look at a lotta people they bunch up together you know and i don't mean to put down like hispanic people but a lot of hispanic do that 

173.32 174.52 A: no no 

175.33 179.00 A: yes they do it's true it's true i've i've heard that 

177.34 186.10 B: in california they'll you know they'll rent a one room apartment and they'll you know maybe come from mexico and get the minimum wage jobs 

179.41 180.27 A: yep 

184.56 191.48 A: exactly right because the way they live in their own country the minimum wage is like three percent you know so but 

187.77 189.75 B: (( yeah )) 

190.82 198.05 B: oh i agree i think one way you could make it on five fifteen if you're a waiter or a driver or something like that limousine driver 

191.59 192.45 A: yeah 

195.98 197.39 A: mhm mhm 

197.46 198.39 A: mhm 

198.27 209.38 B: then obviously you're gonna get tips so if you're getting five fifteen then you're obviously going to get you know maybe double that if you get the tips and that's not taxed 

199.88 201.28 A: mhm mhm 

206.84 208.61 A: mhm but that's not 

208.62 212.45 A: but that's hard you've gotta do what two or three jobs 

210.23 220.47 B: but you're right five fifteen is really ridiculous unless you're living like unless i think you maybe you agree as well as i do if you live in a rural area if you live in the middle of you know what egypt 

220.08 220.98 A: (( mhm )) 

220.69 222.03 B: you know what they say 

221.55 222.46 A: yes 

222.36 228.52 B: if you're in the middle of nowhere yeah you can live off five fifteen but if you live in a metropolitan area forget about it 

222.55 223.19 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

228.54 232.07 A: that's true yeah no no yes i agree 

228.72 230.12 B: (( do you agree )) 

230.72 234.09 B: i mean if you live in a town like two hundred in indiana okay 

233.63 234.68 A: [laughter] 

234.74 241.60 B: you know or a town of a thousand or whatever but if you're living in a town that you know what i mean 

236.87 238.10 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

240.81 251.66 A: put it this way you can't live on your own unless you have three and four jobs for no five fifteen an hour you know what i mean you might have your tips but still you've got to bust you've really gotta work 

246.93 248.39 B: oh i agree 

251.57 256.42 B: oh i agree with you i agree you can't make it on five fifteen even fulltime 

252.46 253.42 A: (( yeah you )) 

254.29 255.26 A: no 

255.44 257.99 A: no you've gotta work a good job 

257.02 258.74 B: you know and plus 

259.23 263.96 A: and then look at it now too you guys having problems over there too with like job wise 

259.36 261.17 B: it's just 

263.71 266.21 B: oh yeah there's a lotta unemployment out here 

265.50 267.67 A: yeah 'cause i'm in a technical field 

267.75 271.05 A: and i'm unemployed and i was working for lockheed martin 

267.96 268.83 B: oh 

271.25 272.62 B: really 

271.73 278.78 A: yeah one of the other companies well they lost their contract so you know what i mean so that's another you know what i mean shoot 

278.70 292.63 B: yeah i know you know and and it's funny 'cause it's not that hard i think you were trying to maybe also say that uh maybe i'm wrong but if you you have your technical job it's not really that simple just to go out and find that same technical job even if you have the skills 

291.93 293.28 A: right right 

292.42 300.19 B: and you might be put in the position well five fifteen maybe you're making five fifteen maybe you're making a little bit more but that's nothing compared with what you're making now 

299.52 301.46 A: no that's right so 

301.20 315.54 B: you know i've just had a friend who got laid off she was making decent money and she even though she's skilled she does work on the computer it's still gonna be basically tough for her to find another job one because she's forty and they discriminate past thirty four 

304.23 304.91 A: mm 

310.68 311.47 A: yes 

314.10 317.76 A: yeah that's me yeah yeah yep yep 

315.39 317.06 B: yeah me too i'm 

317.08 319.23 B: i'm in my late thirties so 

318.29 328.97 A: yep and they don't realize you know something funny i don't know if you've really looked at this do you know that the people in the a lotta people is in our age group 

329.15 335.27 A: and we're the ones that control we're we're the ones that are gonna have very difficulty coming to retire because 

329.24 330.90 B: oh yeah we're like 

334.53 337.70 B: well there's not going to be anything left 

335.31 339.00 A: if if we live a long time they're not gonna have 

339.09 340.27 B: no 

339.61 344.13 A: pension for it no that's why we've gotta take care of ourselves and look at what's happening i mean 

344.33 349.02 A: losing jobs and stuff is not helping building our retirement that's for sure 

349.03 353.88 B: you know and they should treat us better because our age group we're kinda rare 

350.87 352.09 A: exactly 

353.53 355.22 A: ex- exactly 

354.53 368.41 B: we're not the baby boomers we're kinda different generation we have really something to offer as far as creativity because we weren't influenced by all these political things we were but we weren't we didn't have vietnam really what we did we did you know with kids 

355.71 356.63 A: no 

359.27 360.89 A: yes yes 

362.62 363.27 A: (( mm )) 

365.14 366.20 A: (( right )) 

366.86 367.55 A: (( mm )) 

368.31 379.54 B: and we weren't really hippies you know it's like we were in that stage where we're kinda wandering and wondering a lot of tumultuous things happened and there was a lotta commentary and 

369.57 370.95 A: mm mhm mhm 

375.24 376.60 A: mhm mhm 

377.75 381.41 A: and it's not even that back in our days too we were very ambitious 

381.47 383.32 B: yeah 

381.82 390.41 A: we were you know what i mean we went out and we did what we had to do and get what we wanna get these kids these days they're not you know what i mean they don't do what we 

385.98 388.30 B: now it's more who you know not what you know 

389.41 397.51 B: oh yeah i agree you know and if you don't really know anyone i mean even if you do know somebody these days it's still hard to get your foot in the door 

396.83 407.80 A: yeah it is it is 'cause i've been connecting with a lotta people and people have said you know send my resume and look at the job board it's still it's not easy i still haven't

423.76 430.11 B: that i think that would be a i think that's a great choice actually 'cause people are always gonna buy homes 

428.66 433.14 A: well right and and but see the boom is the refinance the interest rate 

432.58 436.26 B: oh right and a lotta people are doing that now because of the recession

435.55 436.54 A: pardon 

436.28 439.34 B: a lotta people are doing that because of the recession 

438.71 440.93 A: right so but

441.57 445.24 A: right so you know so another thing too i still

449.18 461.83 A: right right but even then no but listen to me even those kids yes but even those kids 'cause i've seen my kids i've got teenagers and even those kids don't want to work for no five dollars an hour they said five dollars can't give me nothing 

459.27 463.90 B: no they don't wanna work at mcdonalds all that greasy food 

462.00 465.24 A: nope they said five fifteen can't give me 

465.53 473.41 B: i know they i was you know what but i was the same way too when i was that age i was working for a minimum wage but i was trying

498.57 499.75 B: that's all right 

500.00 501.02 B: (( um )) 

501.09 504.22 B: now your recording told you you were talking about relationships 

503.96 505.25 A: pardon me

518.06 518.64 A: (( mhm )) 

519.67 523.87 A: [mn] of how people keep together they don't anymore 

523.71 529.99 B: oh yeah it seems like people are even less tolerant and people are even getting are nastier than ever 

524.17 527.98 A: things that you know a lotta divorces yeah 

529.35 530.86 A: mhm mhm 

529.94 538.94 B: do you agree kind of they're just not as tolerant everyone is just not as patient because of i think the computer age too you know 

530.94 532.69 A: yes and 

537.63 549.73 A: yeah i know but but you know it's funny because now when the kids are older now when when when families are supposed to be closer together husband and wife it's funny that's the time when they're splitting up too mhm 

549.76 554.30 B: right you know and i think in the old days they stayed together 'cause they had to stay together 

553.56 559.01 A: well that's true again yeah because the man used to be the breadwinner and the woman would be at home that's true 

558.95 562.68 B: yeah and now more days a lot more women are making a lot more money 

559.41 560.41 A: yeah 

561.84 567.25 A: (( true true and they're not putting up with it [laughter] yeah )) 

563.75 568.30 B: it's still not fair though no i agree with you it's still not fair 

567.47 569.53 A: (( yeah that's true that's true )) 

568.57 575.21 B: men are still you know but uh i mean it is nice to see that women are getting their foot in the door because you know as you know 

570.61 571.47 A: yeah 

573.52 574.41 A: uh-huh 

574.88 575.69 A: uh-huh 

575.19 584.56 B: well i i don't know if you know but i i believe women you know maybe have a different touch with things you know mhm 

579.46 583.13 A: mhm yeah but sometimes both sides gotta there's there's 

583.31 594.64 A: sacrifices you have to make things get better like anything like business too when you're discouraged you wanna stop it gets better you don't give up or maybe that's the problem 

591.22 599.89 B: yeah no or you don't get offended real easy 'cause you say something about someone's relative or something you know about someone's mother or their crazy 

596.96 598.68 A: right maybe just
