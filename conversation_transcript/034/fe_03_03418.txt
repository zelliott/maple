10.29 11.36 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

13.50 24.62 A: oh i i think [noise] uh you know [mn] at first you know i think uh a physical attraction you know otherwise [noise] things never really get started you know so so i think you've got to have a phys- physical attraction 

19.33 20.64 B: mhm 

21.44 22.49 B: right 

24.57 37.95 A: first you know and then and then i think um you know somebody that's uh oh probably compatible intelligence you know and just uh [sigh] somebody that can can talk you know and uh um 

37.96 45.51 A: you know di- discuss things and um you know [noise] be able to to discuss things at the same level i guess is is really important you know to

77.32 85.29 B: especially with a life partner that's someone [sigh] you know who you want to spend your life with and so if you don't trust them that could lead to 

85.25 93.29 B: big problems [sigh] so [sigh] but i think what you said about physical attraction is very important because 

92.70 94.54 A: (( uh-huh yeah uh uh you know at least uh [mn] )) 

93.22 100.93 B: if you're not attracted to the person [sigh] it's not very pleasant to be around them sometimes [laughter] [sigh]

121.54 123.01 A: it it you know that sort of 

123.19 132.33 A: thing [noise] you know i think it can uh kind kinda grow you know but there has to be attraction there you know [noise] at some level you know otherwise uh yeah i just don't 

129.73 130.67 B: mhm

218.89 219.48 A: (( [noise] )) 

228.29 240.77 B: relationships i think end badly because the two people maybe met in high school or [sigh] something like that and they think they know what it's all about and [sigh] they rush into stuff and 

240.97 243.69 B: think they're ready for it and they're not [sigh]
