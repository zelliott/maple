0.00 1.71 B: hi my name is matt 

1.54 3.17 A: my name's emily 

2.86 7.13 B: hi emily so minimum wage right now is what five fifteen 

3.97 4.92 A: hi 

6.93 8.58 A: i think so yeah 

7.94 9.78 B: yeah that's not enough 

9.43 11.83 A: no it's not it's um 

10.66 13.71 B: some people have to support a family on five fifteen 

13.65 21.52 A: exactly it's very hard right it's very hard they need um the poverty rates have gone up especially in 

14.18 15.87 B: it ain't happening right 

21.55 25.49 A: suburban areas and that's just not enough i mean you work at 

25.87 34.68 A: um mcdonalds or burger king or something like that and work over forty hours a week and still not support your family especially if you have children 

27.68 28.71 B: right 

34.15 37.75 B: no not at all it's uh definitely have to be 

35.84 36.80 A: yeah 

37.87 44.46 B: uh increased especially in in these times when there is not even any minimum wage jobs 

41.06 42.60 A: yeah and it 

44.50 53.17 A: exactly exactly and they're they're saturated and if you don't have a a higher education then you're kinda stuck and that's why the unemployment rate's so high 

45.30 46.36 B: out there 

53.20 58.81 A: and i i think it leads to other things and you know i mean certainly crimes goes up when 

58.74 72.10 A: poverty rates go up and um and childcare's a big issue um for people that you know single mothers or or mothers and fathers that are making minimum wage they have to work they can't afford childcare 

60.11 61.74 B: (( right that's right )) 

69.24 70.06 B: right 

70.23 72.90 B: and they may not have insurance either right 

72.32 79.82 A: right they can't afford childcare so the kids are left at home alone which you know and then there's problems with that so 

79.48 81.90 B: yeah it's it's a big issue [mn] 

79.82 89.23 A: i mean it festers yeah it festers in many things it's not you know just the problem of the people making minimum wage it's the whole community's problem 

88.86 94.35 B: right so what's how how many hours in a day eight or nine working hours 

94.13 104.75 A: um usually well usually ten is the average for most working class americans yeah i think i read that someplace but you know that most working class americans work 

98.68 99.52 B: it is 

102.90 105.52 B: well let's say ten hours ten hours a day 

105.69 108.36 B: times five dollars an hour say fifty 

108.17 109.96 A: (( mhm )) 

108.37 111.05 B: five fifteens like fifty one dollars 

110.92 112.22 A: right 

111.87 116.16 B: fifty dollars into fifty one dollars a day times five days a week 

116.16 118.26 A: right and then from that you have to 

116.63 119.84 B: it's not even it's not even three hundred dollars a week 

119.11 126.20 A: exactly and from that you have to take out taxes and any you know health insurance and health benefits and 

122.79 124.46 B: (( oh my god that's )) 

126.05 136.51 A: yeah yeah so you're you're looking at people working forty plus hours a week and actually coming home with probably close to probably like two twenty 

127.63 128.44 B: (( crazy )) 

135.81 137.58 B: crazy yeah that's crazy 

137.02 140.30 A: yeah that is i mean by the time you go to the grocery store 

140.48 142.27 A: that's that's your paycheck 

141.75 142.99 B: (( yeah it's )) 

142.61 144.03 A: yeah that's not 

143.10 146.02 B: something's gotta be done something has to change 

145.71 151.61 A: yeah i i think there is legislation right now about that about um increasing 

150.02 154.46 B: yeah and what are they but usually when they increase it it's like what fifty cents 

154.54 160.27 A: you know i don't know i think it jumped from i wanna say from four fifty to five fifteen 

158.87 160.54 B: oh it went up that high 

160.49 162.68 A: i think but i'm not positive 

161.12 164.00 B: a whooping sixty five cents right 

163.31 166.10 A: yeah and that was probably after 

166.04 180.78 A: you know seven years i mean it wasn't like was a year increase it was um yeah because i think if you make minimum wage and you and you calculate that out for a forty hour work week for a year i think that's below the poverty level 

167.93 169.00 B: right 

180.81 189.89 A: 'cause i think poverty poverty is like fourteen five or fifteen five or something like that and so annually i mean basically we're setting people up to 

180.85 183.37 B: yeah that is below it 

184.47 186.10 B: yeah it is 

189.95 203.98 A: you know it's almost cheaper for them if the work is not an incentive exactly the work is not an incentive it's easier for them to stay at home and draw unemployment or draw you know federal subsidy or whatever because 

192.44 194.18 B: to go on welfare 

200.49 201.76 B: right 

203.45 208.39 B: yeah they're better off getting wel welfare i guess they have to work a little bit for the welfare 

208.26 209.22 A: right 

208.54 212.82 B: and uh you know they'll get food stamps and all that stuff 

212.83 214.55 A: yeah exactly 

213.35 215.90 B: you can get government food yeah so 

215.44 217.31 A: exactly so it might be 

216.03 223.40 B: right so exactly what's the incentive for them to go to work for five fifteen they'll make less than they can get from welfare 

221.17 222.46 A: right 

223.27 237.95 A: yeah and it [laughter] well yeah in in some areas but yeah i mean they they definitely need to reevaluate that and most of the community at least where i live are working from louisiana 

223.68 225.56 B: what a joke this country is 

226.09 227.41 B: [laughter] 

229.21 229.86 B: (( [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

234.59 236.13 B: where are you calling from 

237.29 239.06 B: wow louisiana 

238.62 253.32 A: yeah so most most of the people here are working class you know or or lower middle class we don't have a oh really yeah we don't have a high range of you know of wealth you know as far as that goes as far as jobs so 

240.01 240.88 B: (( [noise] )) 

243.25 245.27 B: yeah i'm from new york 

245.85 247.12 B: yeah 

253.72 259.42 A: over fifty percent of probably our population is in working class jobs 

259.12 260.38 B: yeah yeah 

259.75 263.17 A: you know and and that's really sad and i think that's why we have 

261.33 264.59 B: yeah new york you've got the very rich and then you've got the poor 

264.26 276.39 A: right more of a specter of of different yeah yeah definitely well um so there's there's the the burger kings and the mcdonalds and things like that pay minimum wage there 

265.04 266.79 B: [laughter] 

276.04 277.62 B: right yeah they do 

277.16 280.59 A: they do yeah 'cause i know in some places they 

278.37 279.33 B: they do 

281.29 289.74 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] i'm thinking like um some of the ones that are franchised i think they pay their people more or they offer 'em benefits 

283.19 285.05 B: they pay more than minimum wage 

285.66 286.54 B: right 

289.28 290.70 B: right right 

290.07 294.08 A: and so that's a little bit of a perk but most places 

292.18 298.53 B: yeah you know what though i think the best place to work if you can get a job is star bucks you have star bucks there 

298.32 306.10 A: yeah is that well i'm i'm i'm a social worker but um but yeah that's we do have star bucks so they're good 

302.07 302.95 B: mhm 

304.54 314.55 B: they well i heard they're very they have give excellent benefits they're very good to their employees and they give you health benefits after only working twenty hours a week 

310.04 310.80 A: (( [mn] )) 

314.77 315.90 A: wow 

314.79 321.26 B: [lipsmack] so uh it's you know that's but i'm sure those jobs are hard to get now for for the hours i'm sure 

319.50 322.14 A: yeah i'm sure i'm sure they are 

321.75 322.98 B: yeah 

322.40 331.67 A: [laughter] yeah well um so isn't there there is legislation right now i read something about increasing the minimum wage right 

331.57 333.15 B: yeah i think so 

332.30 338.40 A: and is the president is he for that or against that i'm not very up on politics 

335.75 336.76 B: well 

336.83 343.30 B: he might have to do it i mean 'cause unemployment the uh you know they they give these extensions now 

343.63 346.26 B: and that comes down from the president 

347.27 348.84 A: oh for unemployment 

348.30 351.16 B: yeah for extensions in other words 

350.78 351.71 A: ah 

351.45 361.63 B: let's say unemployment you're allowed twenty six weeks of benefits and that they they give the the president signs the bill that [sigh] like set it to an additional thirteen weeks 

362.58 365.14 B: so i think i think that it will happen 

366.07 368.30 B: you know yeah 

366.21 367.51 A: yeah 

367.60 373.52 A: i hope so because it you know i mean and the crime rate here has gone up so much and i think that's 

372.49 374.99 B: everybody's packing right 

374.36 382.88 A: well yeah i think it's related to the fact that people feel desperate you know they can't they can't support their homes they can't support their families and 

378.36 379.93 B: yeah 

383.36 386.57 A: so they turn to alternatives that you know 

386.87 397.29 A: don't help the community any and and and the pride people's pride in their jobs is you know so diminished i mean even even those kinda jobs that i'm talking about you know 

397.19 404.92 A: i mean i'm i'm not that old but i can remember you know as a teenager going to mcdonalds or to whatever 

403.18 404.61 B: i'm thirty two 

405.03 407.14 A: well i'm older than you i'm thirty six 

406.74 407.72 B: okay 

407.23 407.95 A: (( [cough] )) 

408.20 420.36 A: but um and you know it being real clean and you know the customer service being really good and really nice and now it's like you go into some of 'em and they're not that clean and the customer service is 

418.23 420.07 B: yeah they're all ratty 

420.16 432.17 A: yeah and and you know you've got mainly the little teenagers because that's really the only people that'll work for that amount of money and um and they're you know the customer service has gone down because there's no job pride they don't 

426.02 427.19 B: right 

432.29 439.27 A: you know i guess they figure i'm gonna bring home two hundred dollars for working all these hours you know i'm not gonna put out my best they're 

438.62 442.25 B: right yeah i stick with pizza i don't go to mcdonalds [laughter] 

439.45 441.25 A: (( just gonna do the minimum )) 

441.51 447.48 A: [laughter] yeah well we have we don't have many pizza huts here but yeah

470.07 471.11 B: [laughter] 

473.60 477.07 B: yeah i'm sure they're having their own ec- economic uh problems 

476.37 481.41 A: yeah yeah and they have so many people packed into you know 

480.01 481.54 B: you don't like it there 

481.44 493.64 A: well it's just i i mean just the crime rate and just the i mean there's a big fear of you know i mean getting hurt and that kind of stuff yeah so we don't no we used to when you know maybe like 

488.20 489.14 B: really 

493.66 496.95 A: gosh probably when i was in college but not um 

497.16 498.52 A: not since then 

498.17 499.80 B: right right 

498.58 501.67 A: you know 'cause it's it's just you just feel like 

501.72 504.61 A: you know what's gonna happen if i go down there and 

503.67 505.75 B: you used to go there for mardi gras 

505.63 506.72 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

507.00 509.46 A: actually i've only been to mardi gras once 

509.10 510.27 B: (( oh okay )) 

510.13 514.64 A: yeah but um but it was fun yeah you went for mardi gras is that why you went 

513.95 516.75 B: yeah it was wild 

515.02 530.00 A: yeah it gets too [laughter] it's gets pretty wild yeah yeah we were gonna to new york for our honeymoon and actually our plans changed and yeah and actually we would you know we would've loved to go but 

524.15 525.60 B: oh really 

529.38 532.25 B: yeah this is the big apple it's rotten to the core 

531.05 534.24 A: we didn't make it [laughter] really 

533.87 534.94 B: yeah 

534.34 540.62 A: it it sounds exciting i would love i mean just i've never been anywhere like that so it would be exciting to go 

541.12 546.17 B: yeah we have our own problems here but hopefully everything will straighten out in time 

545.60 547.14 A: how long have you lived there 

546.83 548.33 B: my whole life 

548.18 549.14 A: oh 

548.87 549.87 B: yeah 

549.23 550.26 A: wow 

550.53 552.37 B: yeah i'm born and bred 

552.36 559.09 A: [laughter] it's probably i i mean it seems like though here you know after ten eleven o'clock there's nothing to do 

559.21 562.82 A: you know everything just kinda gets quiet and shuts down 

562.86 567.28 A: so i think new york would be just the opposite from everything that that that they you know 

564.84 567.66 B: yes it's twenty twenty four seven 

567.55 569.21 A: yeah the perception 

569.36 573.01 A: and just the diversity of the people i think that would be really cool 

572.76 574.93 B: right right 

573.62 576.36 A: to just see the different people and you know 

576.30 579.96 B: how many how many calls do we have to do of these three calls 

576.50 578.14 A: other different backgrounds 

579.72 581.13 A: i don't know 

581.15 584.13 A: a friend [laughter] told me to do it and i'm like okay 

583.54 585.77 B: and then we get paid right 

585.04 587.08 A: i think so yeah 

585.88 587.88 B: and it's like minimum wage 

587.98 590.21 A: (( i don't know what it is actually oh )) 

590.07 592.95 B: it's uh i think they pay us thirty five dollars 

592.76 593.83 A: okay 

593.78 595.00 B: yeah 

594.55 596.00 A: that's not bad 

595.89 599.95 B: yeah so uh you know e- everything has to be
