528.19 529.83 A: (( [laughter] )) 

529.00 537.80 B: i'm sorta like i mean she's on a boat she but you know it's so silly because [noise] the guy she she's been through a lot of crap and the guy she finally found is perfect and she's twenty one 

537.75 546.90 B: so they're kinda she's a little older than me and they're kinda young but she's also from the south and it's their you know expectations are different [noise] he is actually from mexico

552.49 555.40 B: (( [noise] her mom was actually relieved [laughter] i think )) 

555.75 556.86 B: because like 

556.90 569.93 B: i mean her mother definitely has the mentality of you need a man but i don't think that's why she's marrying him you know they i think part of it is because i i i know that part of it is 'cause they don't wanna be separated and considering that they're in the military they could be separated 

561.32 562.25 A: uh-huh 

568.35 569.10 A: yeah 

569.15 580.43 A: mhm well if is is well if he's yeah uh the one the one thing she has to watch she has to learn spanish regardless even if he speaks perfect english because there's always the in laws that don't speak it
