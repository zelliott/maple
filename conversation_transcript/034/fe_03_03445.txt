1.04 2.99 B: hi i'm mark 

3.03 4.79 A: hi i'm toni 

5.45 6.87 B: h- hi toni 

5.75 7.91 A: um we're how are you 

7.79 9.63 B: good [laughter] 

8.81 15.16 A: good [laughter] uh well we're supposed to discuss wh- uh what to look for in a life partner 

15.47 26.15 A: well then m- my my uh view on this if you're looking for a life partner you're looking for someone who shares the same interests has the same type of goals in life 

26.17 31.02 A: certainly someone who uh it's important that you share the same uh 

31.62 33.32 A: religion um 

34.35 44.00 A: um it's not a concern for me that uh you be of the same race but um if some people find that important but i don't necessarily find that important 

44.12 45.29 B: (( mhm )) 

45.49 47.45 A: (( uh wh- what do you think about it )) 

47.49 55.31 B: uh i well i agree a lot with what uh you've said i think it's uh [mn] very important that you find somebody that you share 

55.17 63.01 B: uh interests with um just in the experiences that i've had in looking for a life partner 

62.97 76.17 B: um there are certain uh things that come into play that [mn] you know [mn] pretty much rule it out pretty quickly that uh you know something you can or can't live with and i think that it kind of comes down to uh 

76.14 89.79 B: you you have to decide what's the most important to you and pick your own bat- pick your battles wisely and uh you know ki- kind of try and figure out exactly what uh will and will not be acceptable for you 

90.46 98.84 A: i agree and i think the important one of the important things that you said there is is to pick your own battles and to really identify what's important and wh- what's really not 

98.90 99.73 B: uh-huh 

98.93 104.06 A: and uh and it's important that both of you both people are on the same page with that because 

103.91 116.21 A: if not you know things that would just roll off your back but if it's a real problem for the other person you know those kinds of things are the things that develop into big problems and you know and causes for divorce and um 

115.46 118.17 B: yeah yeah i agree with that as well 

116.61 117.43 A: (( you know )) 

117.70 125.56 A: i i've seen that happen as well um have you had uh negative experiences in your own life with uh with those kinds of things 

125.94 131.15 B: um [lipsmack] well i've just uh i've dated some people who have turned out to 

130.97 144.05 B: um have some uh bad habits or addictions uh that were life altering for them and it was something that would certainly have affected my life had i stayed with them uh such as um 

141.55 142.27 A: (( mhm )) 

143.95 154.31 B: i i mean [mn] with one person that i had dated it was something as simple as smoking and the inability to uh or or the unwillingness to quit that 

154.18 162.78 B: uh and and as a non smoker that was something that uh you know i i really couldn't deal with um 

154.18 155.35 A: (( mhm )) 

163.44 165.58 B: and uh i think that 

165.48 176.69 B: uh well you know nowadays a life partner uh could be a a a female female a male male a a male and a female you know and i think that um 

176.49 187.28 B: there's a lot that goes into play with that as well uh in in finding a life partner um ha- have you had any ex- negative experiences yourself 

187.17 193.06 A: uh yes uh certainly [mn] you know certainly being young and thinking that uh 

193.28 200.51 A: you know you're in love with this person but then as time goes on realising that there were definite differences in in uh 

200.48 213.45 A: in viewpoints in by deferent- definite differences in goals in life and and you mentioned the point about smoking i'm a non smoker too so that's one of those things that's important to me um i [mn] i also um 

210.81 211.75 B: uh-huh 

214.29 223.93 A: don't drink and have a problem with people who do drink to excess and that's something that you know i would look for and i'm married and have been married for more than twenty years at this point so 

223.59 224.46 B: uh-huh 

224.01 228.75 A: um you know but those are the kind of the things that we had to talk about early on [cough] 

228.98 229.86 B: uh-huh 

229.29 239.89 A: um you know those things that were important i can remember when we went to uh marriage counselling and and the pastor something as simple as you started with well you know 

239.96 244.74 A: just imagine that the house is on fire and you could only take three things with you 

244.82 249.36 A: in order to get out of the house safely and then he asked each of us to write down 

249.83 253.86 A: what were those three things obviously they were three things that were important to 

253.91 261.48 A: to each other and when you know w- we each wrote it down and then we shared it they were three absolutely different things 

255.06 255.87 B: uh-huh 

261.33 271.22 A: so that was [laughter] so [laughter] you know that was a a starting point and really discuss okay [laughter] well you know these are the things we really need to talk about um 

261.62 262.88 B: [laughter] 

268.36 269.42 B: definitely 

271.30 281.30 A: and uh and it was good uh you know i thought it was kind of a silly exercise when he suggested that but it really uh was a an icebreaker to get us to really discuss 

282.51 292.89 A: even the small things which um you know may seem small to some people but can blossom into large uh problem for you down the line if you ju- if you don't talk about them you know so 

284.47 285.43 B: uh-huh 

292.17 293.11 B: uh-huh 

293.02 298.12 A: i mean even something as simple as i grew up with uh i had a younger sister i have an older brother who who 

298.06 301.93 A: was out of the house so i didn't have to deal with sharing a bathroom 

301.71 313.16 A: with a male until i got married [laughter] so you know stuff even those small things you know i can remember us having problems in the beginning 'cause i you know i i had my own bathroom [mn] 

301.91 303.04 B: [laughter] 

304.17 305.20 B: uh-huh 

312.79 313.97 B: oh yeah 

313.35 316.11 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] [mn] [mn] )) 

314.09 314.91 B: yeah 

315.12 319.20 B: well you know i'm i'm not married at this point and i'm uh s- 

319.14 333.12 B: still searching and the person that uh i am with at this time has a a large uh there's a large difference in our educational backgrounds as well um i've got a college degree and they don't and um 

328.15 328.95 A: (( mhm )) 

331.32 332.28 A: okay 

333.31 341.06 B: in fact right now um [laughter] you know i'm in a profession that i will be in probably the rest of my life and they are uh waiting tables 

341.01 341.91 A: okay 

341.19 345.23 B: and uh their family is still 

345.03 356.42 B: bailing them out of all their bills and things like that and i've always been one who's had to really work for everything that i've had um and you know had to really pay my dues to get anywhere and so 

356.21 370.25 B: it's been uh a difficult time to see if that's something that uh [mn] the difference the [mn] it's probably more of an issue for me to overcome because i've always wanted to find somebody who uh shares the same uh [mn] 

370.38 378.99 B: goals in life such as [mn] valuing education you know and uh uh i i begin to wonder if this person 

374.55 375.77 A: (( right mhm )) 

378.75 387.92 B: uh does value that and if they're going to continue to do this uh the entire time that we're together um and if so then 

387.68 394.33 B: uh we may not be together and i may continue [laughter] my search for somebody who is more compatible that way 

394.12 395.02 A: (( okay mhm )) 

395.27 396.45 B: and uh [mn] 

395.29 396.38 A: so somebo- 

396.60 401.95 A: so if even if [mn] this person hasn't gone to college you mentioning you have but if 

402.39 409.51 A: if she were someone who obviously may not go back to college but was was a go getter somebody who was 

409.55 416.07 A: who was always looking to improve herself in in all aspects of her life would that be 

416.49 420.54 A: what you're looking for or are you really interested in somebody who's going to college 

420.68 434.48 B: no i think that um being success- just being successful in your own way is important and you know i think that at this point uh they're settling for less by uh being just a waiter you know they're kind of 

420.81 421.78 A: (( [mn] uh-huh okay )) 

433.63 434.40 A: okay 

434.53 443.69 B: not i- i- if if they were out there and had a job and were you know working their way up in the company and you know succeeding that way but it seems like 

443.53 453.28 B: the last few jobs they've been fired from and you know they just [mn] keep on downgrading to lower [laughter] jobs and lower jobs on the on the food chain 

445.97 446.65 A: mhm 

450.20 452.59 A: oh i see i see what you mean okay 

453.09 466.37 A: yeah and well yeah then that could be a problem because that could really speak to the character of the person you know is this somebody who as you said is is a go getter somebody who's interested in being successful in whatever they're doing or somebody who's just 

453.36 454.51 B: and 

458.79 459.73 B: oh yeah 

467.11 477.48 A: you know accepting whatever comes their way or not motivated you know and that can be a problem if you're if you're a motivated individual and dealing with somebody who's not that's a real problem 

477.51 491.22 B: yeah and the thing is is i think they're holding out for uh their inheritance because they come from a very wealthy family and uh you know when the inheritance comes through which you know um it's going to be quite a while uh they'll 

483.68 484.71 A: (( oh okay )) 

491.23 493.42 B: come out substantially wealthy 

493.22 503.55 B: uh whereas for me um up there's not going to really be an inheritance [laughter] you know and so i i've never planned on that i've never held out for that 

497.76 499.29 A: [laughter] 

499.52 500.48 A: right 

503.35 504.01 A: (( no )) 

503.36 508.37 B: uh knowing that i needed to make my own success [mn] however that may be 

508.13 517.26 A: okay so [mn] maybe the problem with this person is they that they know down the line really working at um [lipsmack] in a successful job 

517.31 527.42 A: [mn] is really not that important because of the fact that they come from a wealthy family and really never had to worry about uh money you know a lack of money okay i see okay 

522.79 523.97 B: exactly 

525.18 525.93 B: yeah 

526.63 527.76 B: [laughter] 

528.07 529.13 A: [laughter] 

528.47 533.27 B: yeah so it's kind of one of those uh turning points in our relationship where 

533.12 543.88 B: uh that is [mn] is becoming a factor and is starting to play a larger role um they've actually decided that uh coming this fall they're going to go back to school 

543.63 544.51 A: okay 

543.64 551.75 B: and work towards getting their their bachelors but uh there's still two years worth of school that they have left and um [lipsmack] 

549.66 550.57 A: okay 

552.00 555.27 B: you know it they're thirty two [laughter] and i think 

554.38 555.26 A: [laughter] 

555.15 556.85 B: (( uh [mn] [laughter] )) 

556.72 561.71 B: [mn] what have you been doing for the last you know fifteen years of your life 

561.43 562.25 A: right 

561.57 563.58 B: you know and um 

563.35 564.74 B: (( [mn] now i )) 

564.53 575.70 B: am i supposed to suffer through with that while they put their efforts fulltime in school and support them um after i already supported myself through school you know do i have to do that for them so 

573.96 574.87 A: okay 

575.50 581.89 B: it's it's still an issue even though they've said well i want to go to school and i want to get that degree 

581.61 584.61 A: right well now but how much time 

584.91 590.54 A: would you realistically want to give to a situation where you just don't see it really going anywhere for you 

590.56 599.89 B: [laughter] well that's just it it's it's kind of come down to that point where i always said i would know [mn] i would know when it was time to move on or if if
