58.68 62.00 B: um sort of that 

62.07 76.34 B: quality that mothers have love for their children it's sort of unquestioned i think is extremely important i've been around and i've had a couple of ex husbands and you know i have a son with um 

67.39 68.75 A: mhm 

76.34 78.16 B: with my life partner 

77.90 79.08 A: mhm 

78.52 91.27 B: and i used to think that nothing is forever but i've i'm turning fifty this year and it's i i i really don't think one is any better than the other [laughter] out there 

81.36 82.32 A: uh-huh 

90.66 92.03 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

92.20 93.58 A: well i 

93.68 100.00 A: i've just i turned thirty three this year i've not ever been married um i i'm thirty three 

97.53 98.78 B: how old are you 

99.64 101.25 B: thirty three uh-huh 

100.70 102.93 A: mhm i turned thirty three this year 

102.55 103.81 B: mhm 

103.14 104.38 A: (( and )) 

104.62 113.11 A: i don't know i think i think as i get older i don't think the things that i would look for have changed that much drastically but they've changed of course 

109.74 110.56 B: oh 

112.78 114.08 B: mhm 

113.40 114.32 A: um 

114.38 118.23 A: fine isn't all that important [laughter] um 

116.38 117.52 B: what isn't 

118.27 130.35 A: a fine man isn't all that important [laughter] that used to be at the top of the list but now it's kind of dwindled down towards the end but um i think the most important thing for me is integrity 

120.38 122.54 B: (( mm mm )) 

122.85 123.43 B: mm 

124.31 125.28 B: yes 

126.04 127.02 B: yes 

130.80 132.10 B: integrity 

131.85 133.26 A: mhm 

132.28 134.00 B: that's a good one too 

133.84 135.46 A: mhm it uh 

134.45 141.80 B: boy if you could find a man with loyalty and with integrity [laughter] and some great looks [laughter] 

138.78 139.79 A: (( but you know )) 

140.12 147.48 A: i think that i think that that loyalty would probably fall in in integrity or probably i don't know you i don't see how 

146.10 148.84 B: i think it could be synonymous yes 

148.22 151.59 A: yeah i don't see how you could have one without without having the other 

151.16 153.77 B: yeah they're two very good qualities 

151.99 152.73 A: (( yeah )) 

153.11 165.30 A: very important qualities because once you once you've found somebody that has integrity and loyalty pretty much everything else i think is gonna fall in line i mean of course you have to be compatible i mean those are givens 

154.77 156.03 B: mhm 

164.97 166.68 B: (( yeah )) 

165.82 170.91 A: yeah you you have to be compatible with them that's uh otherwise that's not gonna work 

170.79 174.02 B: that's true and that's a hard find also 

174.24 175.57 A: yeah 

174.83 182.33 B: especially when you get on i found that after i after i turned forty and that i had um 

183.08 184.48 B: sort of my own 

184.69 197.27 B: lifestyle and my own expectations and things are set more than than earlier years you know you're sort of more set on your life and your d- not demands but your 

190.20 191.22 A: (( mhm mm )) 

197.29 199.52 B: um just your style 

199.37 200.51 A: right 

199.94 204.04 B: so to find somebody who's gonna fall in with that that's also your age 

202.57 212.24 A: well you know what you're looking for you know what works with you i used to hear i hear people say um opposites attract but i don't think i want someone that that's that opposite from me 

212.41 226.09 B: well it doesn't work in the creative field i know that because i've tried that and it's a constant battle i'm a filmmaker and it is a constant constant battle to to always be polar 

215.91 216.85 A: no 

226.11 227.35 A: mhm 

226.64 229.70 B: if you disagreed creatively and it 

229.78 237.45 B: you know you can disagree about politics but creative creativity is such an a a an embedded thing 

237.40 238.66 A: mhm 

237.57 244.73 B: it's such a passionate thing so if you're polar creatively i don't know that's a very difficult thing to 

243.71 244.55 A: yeah 

244.96 246.09 B: to live with 

246.24 259.46 A: i don't i don't i don't necessarily know that i even want to venture out and to find someone that's that different from me because i i mean i for the qualities that i really like about me i want somebody to possess those same qualities you know 

259.08 260.62 B: mm what sign are you 

260.61 262.12 A: (( pisces [laughter] )) 

262.26 263.20 B: (( pisces )) 

263.33 264.95 A: mhm 

264.09 267.86 B: mhm so are you dating someone do you have a lover 

267.62 275.21 A: no not dating anybody um i was i think my last serious relationship ended last year around this time 

275.05 282.74 A: and i i sincerely believe in once you once you're out of a relationship especially if it was serious you need time to get back yourself 

282.71 291.57 A: and it literally took me a whole year to really just kinda get back to myself i needed to replenish all of me before i tried to give it away again you know 

287.71 288.35 B: (( mm )) 

290.92 293.07 B: well that makes so much sense 

292.94 294.96 A: yeah and it 

293.96 301.67 B: that's very soulful also you know but it some it could be interpreted as selfish but it's a- actually survival 

296.10 296.74 A: (( mm )) 

301.67 308.80 A: it it really is and i'm a firm believer that if you don't if you're not the best you to yourself you really can't be anything to anybody else 

308.23 309.76 B: mhm 

309.02 314.70 A: so i just you know i really spend a lot of time with me and just you know 'cause i don't wanna 

314.67 326.89 A: i i don't wanna give till i don't have anything else to give and then i don't wanna give halfheartedly so if i'm not you know the best me i don't i really kinda just don't venture off into serious relationships 

326.79 328.38 B: are you there now 

328.72 338.61 A: am i there now yeah i'm there i think i'm i think i'm [laughter] i'm there and i'm ready but um i'm not a i'm [laughter] i'm not in any rush 

330.82 332.32 B: oh good 

335.14 335.74 B: (( [laughter] )) 

338.35 339.28 B: mm 

338.91 343.44 A: and i 'cause i enjoy life i enjoy learning about myself 

343.55 344.58 A: um 

344.82 355.41 A: i hate i hate boring people so i don't ever wanna bore anybody [laughter] you know and so i spend i spend a lot of time just really learning more about myself and more about life and and 

349.16 350.40 B: mhm 

355.18 362.43 A: just i don't know i'm not i'm not preoccupied i never felt that whole oh my god i'm thirty and i don't have any kids i never felt that 

361.77 363.66 B: well that's good 

362.93 373.14 A: thank god i i just hope it doesn't creep up on me as i find myself venturing into thirty four or thirty five and no husband no kids 'cause i'm i'm so looking forward to that [laughter] [mn] 

363.96 364.94 B: yeah 

372.62 376.52 B: yeah well you'll find somebody 'cause you have the right vibe 

376.77 379.13 B: you have you're putting out the right 

377.03 377.79 A: well 

379.24 384.52 B: feeling for someone to em- for to embrace you you know what i mean 

384.02 385.56 A: (( thank you )) 

384.92 390.37 B: is yeah i mean it sounds good if you can practice what you preach [laughter] as my mother used to say 

388.24 398.01 A: yeah and that's and that's me i'm one of those people i live what i you know i i hate hypocrites i think the biggest sin in the world to me is hypocrisy i hate that 

396.56 398.63 B: (( mm mm )) 

397.86 404.37 A: so i just you know i make sure that anything that i i proclaim i'm definitely living it myself [sigh] 

404.22 407.90 B: uh you talk about hypocrisy and and um 

408.20 413.04 B: and the double standard uh sort of comes into play 

413.28 427.27 B: almost int- almost automatically when you have children growing up in your house you like to drink but yet you don't like them to drink you like to s- you know you may swear but of course they can't and it's very hard to be 

426.41 428.36 A: (( but see i don't think that's a double )) 

427.55 428.58 B: true 

428.63 433.53 A: standard though i think it i think i think in raising kids 

433.43 446.08 A: i think you you definitely want to to be the person you want your kids to become or do to have a good role model for but that doesn't mean that it's a double standard because in reality 

440.88 442.18 B: mhm 

445.90 452.07 A: kids cannot uh someone that's twelve years old would not be able to handle the intoxication that comes along with 

451.93 453.47 A: (( be- bec- )) 

453.23 467.97 A: taking a drink you know and making that a kid can't handle that so it's not hypocrisy it's just that you know these are things that you can do when you're old enough to handle that or you're old enough to make the proper decision so i don't look at it as a double standard 

454.80 456.22 B: (( mm well )) 

456.41 458.27 B: (( that's true too true )) 

464.12 464.95 B: mm 

465.27 466.12 B: mm 

467.17 478.58 B: no i find my [mn] i sort of am a little bit hard on myself i have a nine year old i mean he's far from being an adult but i mean just that yes the example is 

478.62 489.97 B: is is set and yes you want them to emulate you and when they do [laughter] and you don't like it [laughter] it's a shock but um 

484.79 490.04 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

489.93 501.64 B: um i i was brought up in a in a home where there was quite a bit of double standards and uh i'm sort of just ac- acutely aware of it but i don't beat myself up about it but 

495.17 496.19 A: mhm 

498.39 499.59 A: mhm 

500.97 514.50 A: yeah uh 'cause i don't know i just don't i don't i guess i'm so i'm so so open minded and i don't i don't see that as a double standard i think it would be a double standard if you were if you were self righteous about it 

513.92 514.98 B: (( mm )) 

514.65 520.25 A: but we're all growing you know so i think that if you explain to your kids you know [sigh] 

516.63 517.74 B: that's true 

520.06 529.80 A: i'm i'm a grownup grownups do make mistakes as well and this is why i have rules and regulations in order for you so that you don't have such a struggle with the things that i may be struggling with 

525.91 526.73 B: mm 

529.28 530.87 B: (( mm mm )) 

530.63 533.41 A: sounds like a cop out but it really i mean it it 

532.20 538.49 B: no but it's a very good good positive straightforward attitude you know it's very truthful 

536.74 538.22 A: (( and it really isn't )) 

538.46 549.27 A: i think kids i think we don't give kids enough credit i think they're exceptionally smart they're bright and as long as you give them the proper tools they'll make good decisions even if you mess up in their sight 

542.89 544.06 B: oh yes 

549.44 555.49 B: that's true that's true they're they're very resilient and they wanna do the right thing if you if they're loved 

552.59 553.66 A: mhm 

553.75 554.79 A: mhm 

555.28 556.24 A: right 

555.76 557.83 B: you know especially if they're loved 

557.68 559.99 A: especially if they're allowed 

560.59 561.74 B: if they're what 

560.60 561.70 A: i work with 

561.67 572.59 A: i work with kids and um mhm i work with kids and parents as a matter of fact and a lot of them go when i first meet them they're like you're so young you don't have any kids what do you know 

562.93 563.97 B: oh do you 

566.74 567.83 B: wow 

572.42 577.49 A: i'm like you know what most of it is common sense and i think that i probably have an upper hand because 

577.32 591.70 A: i can be objective because i don't have kids to go home to so i may be able to see some things that you may not be able to see because you're so when when you're in it you know you really can only see what you're in a lot of times so sometimes somebody that's not in it can say you know what 

580.79 582.29 B: (( mm mm )) 

587.56 589.38 B: yes yes yes 

591.56 593.69 A: maybe this or maybe that 

594.17 595.06 B: mm 

595.25 596.05 B: mm 

595.52 598.16 A: you know it's all about being objective 

597.99 599.95 B: it's true it's true and open
