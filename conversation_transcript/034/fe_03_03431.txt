76.53 88.08 A: [lipsmack] oh there are free newspapers one's called the city pap- and it's called city weekly and better than like the enquirer the bolt and the major newspapers to tell what's really happening in the city what's really going on 

81.00 81.85 B: uh-huh 

86.06 87.41 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

87.68 92.48 B: uh-huh uh-huh oh very good yeah so is this the first call you've done

92.17 94.02 A: no it's the second call 

93.06 97.70 B: okay oh i see okay well cool shall we talk on the topic then 

97.29 98.56 A: sure no problem 

98.19 102.62 B: oh okay well let's see it's what ch- choosing life partners 

102.08 102.98 A: (( yep )) 

102.47 113.00 B: what are the criteria i guess one of the things that i'd think of is is having good communication uh problem solving with the person um 

112.03 112.97 A: right 

112.79 123.22 B: and uh 'cause i was married a number of years ago and for for a while but i've been single for a substantial period of time and 

116.53 117.36 A: okay 

123.02 128.61 B: obviously have watched the the the relationships of many friends 

129.67 130.73 B: so 

129.90 134.43 A: right well i'm not married uh i do live with my boyfriend but let's 

133.76 134.51 B: uh-huh 

134.61 138.82 A: just say uh well we don't get along that well [laughter] 

138.19 140.81 B: oh [laughter] well that 

139.20 141.66 A: well we stay together but uh 

140.88 143.10 B: yeah well why stay with him 

142.69 146.10 A: well the thing is it's it's a long story [laughter] 

143.19 144.44 B: it's just easier 

145.14 148.01 B: oh okay well that's not necessary 

146.78 148.15 A: (( so um )) 

148.70 153.64 A: i understand because uh i think with a life partner um 

153.96 157.78 A: you have to first of all you should have things in common for one thing 

157.50 158.97 B: mhm 

157.94 165.99 A: and be able to uh you know communicate uh you know and talk and you know uh even though you might not uh 

166.03 174.81 A: agree on like certain issues like politics religion et cetera you should be able to discuss it you know openly without having to get all 

174.91 175.73 A: (( you know )) 

175.60 177.02 B: yep yep 

176.16 178.78 A: without it all getting a mess and everything [laughter] 

177.33 178.62 B: (( yep yep )) 

178.62 185.68 B: well i guess the thing that that occurs to me is that the areas it's it's useful to 

185.57 196.13 B: have been in a relationship with a person long enough that you kind of know where the areas where you agree and disagree and know how you handle 

195.81 196.77 A: right 

196.16 209.82 B: handle that 'cause i think it is it's it's important i think to to really enjoy the person and have fun with them and and i for me it's somebody who has a sense of humor makes me laugh um 

196.89 197.88 A: (( mhm )) 

203.66 204.57 A: right 

207.00 207.81 A: mhm 

209.07 213.51 A: oh definitely i agree with a sense of humor it runs in my family i have a good sense of humor 

210.75 212.38 B: so yeah 

213.16 214.66 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

214.73 215.55 B: (( yeah )) 

215.13 226.54 A: and uh also uh with a life partner you gotta figure out whether say like you both like animals or dislike animals or what kind 'cause i have a cat [laughter] 

224.77 225.75 B: mhm 

225.95 226.76 B: uh-huh 

227.23 234.07 A: and uh i think that's another important issue because uh [lipsmack] well now i know two guys um 

234.93 235.96 A: um 

235.99 241.30 A: they just happen to be gay they live they live in a nice house around uh here and uh 

242.62 244.32 A: and um okay 

244.33 247.13 A: i asked them one time and they said um 

247.23 257.49 A: i asked them i said what is the proper term and i said is the proper life partner and they said yes 'cause they've been living together for a long time and they've lived in uh different parts of the city but now they 

254.28 255.84 B: mhm 

257.67 262.15 A: they've been living uh in the house here uh right around the corner from me in henry avenue 

262.09 263.37 B: mhm 

262.68 264.03 A: so um 

264.64 271.25 A: and i they come out their back door just sitting there you know on the patio and stuff so we get to talking and i asked them i said 

268.66 269.42 B: uh-huh 

271.42 284.66 A: you know i said what is the prop- i said is the proper term life partners 'cause i didn't wanna say they're you know they had to be gay but they're so nice guys and uh they said yes it's the proper term so when the topic was life partners you think okay [laughter] 

278.11 278.88 B: uh-huh 

280.70 282.25 B: sure you know what 

283.64 293.38 B: well i think that works that term kinda works for heterosexual couples as well as for for homosexual couples and and others so yeah yeah so 

287.43 289.54 A: yes yeah it does 

289.71 290.58 A: (( uh-huh )) 

293.43 301.28 B: um yeah because i think the thing is is choosing somebody that you uh that that you enjoy being with 

301.02 301.92 A: right 

301.16 310.27 B: uh that that makes you feel positive about yourself as well as you really wanna want to uh 

305.59 306.37 A: right 

310.26 323.21 B: um be be supportive of what their life and aspirations are you know without feeling like you're taking something from yourself um you're you know 

313.63 314.59 A: (( [mn] )) 

317.79 318.65 A: right 

320.42 321.35 A: mhm 

323.25 337.71 B: giving something up and um so i don't know i i was thinking about it if whether i think it's important for me uh whether you know spiritual values or religious values is are comparable 

324.53 325.42 A: right 

337.04 340.14 A: well there might uh because um 

339.90 342.22 B: (( mhm )) 

341.06 346.71 A: uh when i was going to church years ago and um second baptist um [lipsmack] 

347.49 352.24 A: although i went to other different churches there was a young man and he came to the baptist church 

353.60 362.11 A: the other was catholic but he came to baptist church and uh i think you are married or live with somebody with another religion um 

356.24 357.19 B: mhm 

362.32 372.30 A: um if you if they each wanna go to a different church or synagogue i think that's fine if you i mean most people can handle that they can you know discuss it openly and say okay now 

372.42 376.62 A: this is my religion this is yours and we can celebrate um 

377.01 384.82 A: you know if your jewish you can celebrate hanukkah and i'm a catholic and i'm gonna celebrate christmas i think you really if you love that person you can work that out 

385.03 398.64 B: yeah and i guess that's the part that's the part why i come back to communicate and problem solving as really being a very root one because uh you know it could be somebody that i like who 

389.31 390.19 A: yeah 

398.65 399.58 B: we 

399.78 409.35 B: have some areas that we really disagree in but that if we know that and know how we're handling it so that it isn't isn't uh 

409.42 412.35 B: harmful to the relationship then 

410.97 411.97 A: right 

412.36 418.60 B: cool you know that's i'm i'm all for having a life partner [laughter] 

413.24 414.10 A: (( yeah )) 

416.19 417.15 A: uh-huh 

417.32 427.88 A: and then you gotta figure out 'cause uh some people don't like sports and i do and other people don't that's another issue and then you got uh okay yeah 

421.41 422.23 B: uh-huh 

422.61 423.44 B: uh-huh 

423.66 424.47 B: right 

427.88 435.42 A: you gotta share uh a house or apartment and uh who does the you know cooking and cleaning and 

430.43 431.59 B: mhm 

432.84 434.57 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

434.78 437.03 B: yeah like yes we 

436.16 437.91 A: laundry and et cetera 

437.59 438.39 B: sure 

438.17 444.80 B: and i guess the other in addition to the task it's attitude toward money that may be in fact be probably 

442.75 444.66 A: oh yeah i agree 

444.57 457.04 B: probably another really important one you know that that um because you could drive each other crazy if you were [laughter] one was one uh one uh 

447.42 448.32 A: right 

451.57 452.53 A: [laughter] 

456.95 467.70 B: spent a lot and the other was a saver i have a friend who who in his marriage that's the issue and they've had it's taken them quite a bit of time to work out ways 

463.14 464.32 A: oh boy 

467.59 473.85 B: to handle each of their differences as well as you know 

471.14 472.07 A: okay 

474.03 476.14 B: come upon modifying 

476.39 487.01 B: behavior on both sides you know to to make it a little easier and uh yeah in fact of the ways they started was to j- jointly agree to go sit down with a 

477.95 478.79 A: right 

486.96 494.86 B: with an accountant to you know a c. p. a. and kind of go over this stuff as a as a way of beginning to try to 

489.63 491.93 A: oh that's that's a good idea 

494.97 500.42 B: put some objective things you know on the you know yeah yeah 

497.96 500.28 A: that's very smart and i know uh 

500.55 506.38 A: i know the university of penn uh advertise every so often in the newspaper um 

504.85 505.72 B: uh-huh

511.53 512.86 B: mhm 

513.38 517.97 A: your life partner your husband or wife and then you go and uh work out issues

540.36 548.12 B: yeah yeah well that's at least that that helps you out with the the money and getting you some medic aid for your medical stuff then too doesn't it 

546.71 552.07 A: yeah but they don't pay for all things my uh h. m. o. but they pay for some and then
