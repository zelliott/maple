308.52 309.33 B: huh 

309.46 313.36 A: i probably would've uh gone gone west myself

343.03 346.35 A: keokuk is way down way down in the corner mhm 

343.03 344.15 B: um 

348.50 352.48 B: he was saying how he used to go into other states and uh get into fights with other people 

353.42 355.80 B: apparently there's not much to do in iowa 

354.95 358.27 A: uh yeah i think it's true about half the state leave 

358.40 362.91 A: i think uh they're probably more iowans in california than there are in iowa 

363.22 365.15 A: or more ex iowans 

365.50 367.79 B: i believe that 

366.60 370.59 A: i know they have big uh iowa picnics and stuff out there [mn] 

370.32 372.25 B: oh yeah 

370.83 375.54 A: yeah i think l. a. areas got a lot of uh a lot of defectors [laughter] 

376.09 381.28 A: michigan maybe doesn't uh lose so many michigan at least has a a couple of cities 

381.28 383.52 B: [laughter] 

381.40 390.20 A: iowa iowa doesn't have much like des moines which is the capital city and the largest city's only maybe it's two hundred thousand 

385.75 386.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

390.49 391.20 B: mm 

391.55 392.84 B: that's pretty tiny 

392.64 395.25 A: so yeah there's not there's not much else 

396.01 397.69 A: it's all corn and hogs 

397.98 401.11 B: [noise] [laughter] farm life 

400.32 402.07 A: yeah 

402.45 404.12 A: (( so did you in a city )) 

402.72 403.84 B: um 

404.74 405.83 B: say again 

405.28 407.03 A: did you grow up in a city 

406.49 408.15 B: no no small town 

408.21 416.61 B: i was in uh small town population of about eight thousand lived there until high school and then went to uh college 

412.42 413.14 A: (( mm )) 

417.88 424.73 B: and college was actually pretty uh pretty large it was uh ann arbor but it's still only about a hundred and fifty thousand people 

421.65 422.46 A: (( uh-huh )) 

423.42 425.26 A: that's yeah maybe that's 

425.63 429.77 A: [mn] first or second biggest uh college in the country though i think 

430.07 437.63 B: um the actual population the student population was closer to about thirty five thousand but the city 

434.99 437.73 A: oh yeah that's michigan state 

437.99 439.98 A: that's university of michigan 

439.76 441.77 B: yeah 

440.79 442.85 A: university of michigan at ann arbor 

442.60 444.86 B: exactly exactly 

443.38 445.79 A: is michigan state bigger than michigan 

445.84 457.92 B: uh michigan state is uh is up in lansing and not in the capital and uh state of uh michigan uh university of michigan's in ann arbor which is about uh about an hour and a half south 

450.36 451.27 A: oh 

454.19 455.02 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

456.63 458.91 A: is michigan state bigger than michigan 

459.12 461.37 B: oh that's a good question um 

461.75 466.09 A: i always thought there was one of these schools was like sixty or sixty five thousand students mm 

466.00 479.51 B: well it's weird 'cause there's there's there's different numbers for the school like i was uh told that there was uh fifty thousand and then someone corrected me and like no there's thirty five thousand and it depends on you know how many of these students you count like do you count 

479.40 493.73 B: foreign exchange students that are just there for the semester do you count teacher admins i mean it's a weird funny line to really say how many students are in a school so i i'd say it could be anywhere between thirty and fifty thousand 

488.31 490.07 A: yeah well i always 

491.87 500.75 A: mm yeah well i always thought that that was one of the biggest uh schools in the country i think i think texas is also very large 

497.79 500.50 B: it seemed like it 

500.92 503.81 B: and the alumni system is just [mn] huge 

502.90 504.68 A: yeah 

504.69 507.80 B: i mean i've run into a number of alumni out here 

507.27 508.05 A: yeah 

508.50 509.54 A: uh 

509.58 523.16 A: i'll [mn] i suppose there's a couple of pretty sizeable uh california schools too but california has a uh very large probably the largest uh system of universities or so 

522.48 523.22 B: (( mm )) 

523.43 525.61 A: like u. c. this and that 

525.56 528.13 B: yeah there's definitely a lot of u. c.s 

529.36 532.68 B: definitely throw a rock and hit a college here in los angeles 

531.02 532.19 A: (( yeah how )) 

533.47 535.17 A: long you been out there 

535.32 538.27 B: uh about a year and a half now uh 

537.07 539.05 A: oh oh not so terribly long 

538.94 547.08 B: no no i'm a pretty new transplant i uh just got the urge to move uh to somewhere warmer and uh los angeles seemed like a good 

547.16 548.00 A: yeah 

547.59 550.45 B: (( bet )) 

550.51 554.13 A: yeah i've i've visited l. a. a few times but i never uh 

554.21 558.93 A: never felt like i could quite uh [mn] fathom the spirit of the place [laughter] 

558.91 564.57 B: [laughter] it's a it's a weird town but i mean [noise] um for me it was like 

564.66 572.23 B: i was leaving uh detroit which was just kind of a run down city and there was just a lot more opportunity in uh in los angeles 

569.88 571.58 A: (( [laughter] yeah [mn] i uh )) 

571.85 582.35 A: yeah i uh i know this is true detroit i i don't know detroit terribly well i've been there once or twice and not for a very long time maybe 

582.47 585.40 A: (( [mn] you know twenty seven or eight years ago i was there )) 

585.77 595.87 A: and uh it it started to uh decline then but i think it's rapid decline started happening pretty soon after that and uh 

594.21 598.75 B: [mn] [mn] yeah definitely it's it's pretty much in the toilet right now 

598.30 599.89 A: yeah i've got some friends who live there
