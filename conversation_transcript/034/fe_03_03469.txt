280.85 281.92 B: (( yeah )) 

283.74 297.36 B: yeah well you know there's like i always said there's five million girls out there [laughter] and you and there's gonna be someone that you're going to be attracted to but you've gotta find the one that you feel that uh you could make it uh you know 

287.87 288.73 A: [laughter] 

297.38 298.76 B: (( the rest of your life )) 

299.05 301.73 B: what about your parents are are they 

302.28 305.98 B: married a couple of times or they like well lifetime partners 

304.79 308.79 A: yeah yeah actually one of them is married now um 

309.14 313.85 A: one of them is ma- well i mean they're married right now but uh 

311.32 312.12 B: mhm 

314.80 327.39 A: [lipsmack] no wait my mom is not married my dad is married there we go but um he's not uh he i mean that's the only time he remarried or whatever basically and she's never remarried and um 

318.28 320.10 B: mhm 

327.37 333.41 A: they've they've been only ones together though with each other really basically besides his new wife he has now but 

332.29 334.18 B: mhm 

333.74 337.00 A: (( even with her i don't think he really wants to be with her )) 

337.63 343.72 A: it just sounds more temporary like okay why not sure you know [laughter] but um 

338.85 350.28 B: [laughter] but i mean you know sometimes it could be in people's blood okay 'cause uh my father is spanish okay 

350.20 351.10 A: mm 

350.44 364.81 B: and he could never find that right girl [laughter] you know he was married about four five times and he's even lived you know when i was like eighteen he was living with this young chick with a kid you know taking care of her so he was really never really settled down 

364.79 370.83 B: and then of course my step father he you know fell in love with my mother and he stayed with her uh 

371.15 382.91 B: you know a lifetime you know so you know it all depends on you know maybe some of the old values but maybe people today have different values 

373.07 373.85 A: mm 

383.01 385.86 A: yeah people definitely have different values these days 

385.35 387.60 B: mhm 

386.38 393.84 A: these days you know values are a whole another thing man it's like people don't really i think before there used to be a lot more traditional roles 

393.94 398.96 A: um nowadays i don't feel that personally those roles are there too often um 

399.33 410.81 A: like you know with the church and everything and you know family et cetera um there's no strong you know there's no strong backing people are just doing it to do it like you said taking risks and stuff 

410.79 421.60 A: that's exactly what's happening people are taking risks and just that's that's where they go with their life and i don't think that's necessarily what we need to be doing 'cause it's bringing about the diseases it's bringing about confusion 

421.52 432.16 A: it's bringing about a lotta problem and chaos i mean it's bound to happen to a certain extent but then again you know we could prevent a lotta things if we just stop and think for a moment and take our time you know 

432.32 439.04 B: yeah well we you know uh we have to make the right decision that's for us 

438.83 452.35 B: but you know when you're uh married and have a partner you have to make the right decision for your family and you have to have the right priorities uh the number one person in everybody's life is their god whatever religion they are 

442.36 443.51 A: (( [cough] [noise] )) 

446.79 448.05 A: yeah that's true 

452.20 455.57 B: and then comes the wife and then comes the children 

452.35 452.99 A: mm 

455.39 468.94 B: and uh that's the priorities but uh sometimes i think the newer generation it's more uh because i think they've been really spoilt [laughter] it's more uh they come first than uh that's uh number one 

465.58 466.52 A: yeah 

469.46 470.69 A: (( yeah it's definitely )) 

471.62 473.22 A: (( right now )) 

473.37 479.95 A: so many people are just really there i mean uh if not spoiled then it's just like on some you know very liberal 

479.94 486.98 A: you know it's just kinda like their the people that are spoilt are also like saying why not sure i can do what i wanna do [cough] 

486.92 495.94 A: um you know i've always got to why can't i now you know and then the ones that is just liberal is like oh sure why not you know play 

495.52 502.57 B: well you have to look at the the gender here uh guys wanna be a bachelor play the play the field 

501.96 503.32 A: the field 

502.82 513.11 B: yeah and women wanna settle down and raise a family so where does the middle line come where the guys say hey i'm ready to make that life partnership 

506.04 506.86 A: [laughter] 

512.38 522.01 A: and see there's also the the um [lipsmack] interactions of uh where people say it was funny um i think it was where they said uh 

522.29 527.85 A: um dad's are staying home now and more women are working you know that's starting to be the thing too 

527.89 541.86 A: and it's uh funny how roles are starting to switch in that manner and how that might play a role in uh in what uh [cough] a person's life um partner might be 'cause someone else might actually looking for a guy actually might be like okay i'm staying home now you know what i'm saying 

541.67 548.87 B: well yeah it's kinda how as a guy how you uh like to be around kids you know 

541.80 543.18 A: (( [noise] )) 

548.68 560.04 B: uh usually [laughter] you know you get to a certain age you don't want any little kids being around you know what i mean you you don't they're not necessary but you know some parents 

555.67 556.57 A: yeah 

560.10 573.69 B: you know and uh guys they like uh socializing with kids you know no matter with boys or girls you know it's interesting but the kids really haven't changed you know from the the generation to generation you know kids are always gonna be kids 

573.94 575.09 A: (( yeah that's true )) 

574.75 577.98 B: you know i've gotta a funny thing my uncle to say to me 

577.85 590.38 B: and he was really uh a cool cool guy my uncle and he used to say hey when you get around kids don't say anything listen to what they're talking about [laughter] he said it's just amazing so like
