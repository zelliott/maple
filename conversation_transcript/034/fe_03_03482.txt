29.08 30.15 A: (( effect [laughter] )) 

35.46 44.51 A: that's correct that's correct maybe you you sound a little possibly older than me maybe you have a little bit more insight into this situation than i do but

54.89 56.00 A: i see 

55.61 62.88 B: uh life partners i would say uh first of all [mn] um uh of course uh would be compatibility 

62.23 63.91 A: right right 

63.38 73.21 B: uh you know i i see uh [cough] you know a number of reasons i'm still single in my life is uh that uh i've had i've had a number of relationships and uh 

72.98 86.78 B: [mn] you know what i thought at first was compatible uh you know was uh what i thought would be compatible uh turned out not to be so you know i i think first of all that's uh 

80.12 81.02 A: okay 

87.05 90.44 B: first first and foremost uh that com- 

89.21 101.28 A: well re- reflecting on back on that can what would you say uh makes them compatible or what would've made them compatible that did not make them compatible uh the ones that you're thinking about 

101.81 115.00 B: i'm thinking that uh uh what i did what i did was probably uh [mn] jumped in a relationship too quick all right without uh know- knowing the person uh well enough 

109.65 110.68 A: i see 

114.62 115.67 A: right 

115.22 117.49 B: uh you know i was uh 

117.50 131.64 B: you know uh [mn] and and also not knowing uh myself or what it is that that i truly wanted i i think that uh uh a few years ago what i did was i was in a situation 

125.78 126.87 A: i see 

131.58 144.06 B: and um [mn] you know i said to myself well you know this is not how i'm going to live anymore and these are the things that i'm not going to do anymore and these are the things that i'm going to do 

143.64 144.79 A: right 

144.10 154.38 B: and then you know that's what i had to do i had to sit down and uh you know decide what it is that i wanted in a person what i you know you know 

154.16 164.02 B: things like uh you know i didn't wanna have any violence in in my in my relationship i didn't wanna have you know like screaming and arguing where it would be 

164.06 165.45 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

165.57 179.10 B: you know carried on for an extended period of time uh where you know like yeah an argument's fine every once in a while but let's not make a habit of it and uh let's kiss and make up after that [mn] 

169.29 170.33 A: right 

175.78 176.34 A: (( [mn] )) 

178.12 179.32 A: right 

179.03 183.69 B: uh you know and it's then and not not stay mad at each other so 

182.71 183.74 A: i see 

183.91 189.54 B: uh yeah 'cause i was in a a couple of relationships and you know they were um 

187.38 188.45 A: right 

189.87 199.20 B: a little rough uh let's say and um you know at that time i was i was drinking myself and the other person that i had been with were drinking 

198.82 200.54 A: oh two drinkers then 

199.23 200.08 B: (( uh )) 

200.12 203.34 B: yes [laughter] so that's like uh two atom bombs 

200.67 201.64 A: okay 

202.71 204.00 A: right right 

203.40 209.20 B: uh together so you know that that's that's some of the things i had to think about 

204.63 205.47 A: mhm 

208.55 209.62 A: i see 

209.33 216.49 B: you know along with uh you know and then i find uh [cough] you know i'm just thinking of a relationship here uh 

216.55 220.05 B: uh recently in in the last couple of years uh 

220.34 221.44 B: um 

222.11 227.77 B: of course honesty you know i i feel is uh number one 

224.23 225.08 A: right 

227.39 228.60 A: mhm 

228.08 240.70 B: uh you know after you you have compatibility uh you know and to find that she's into maybe like things similar and the things that you dislike you can accept in each person 

232.30 233.12 A: right 

235.11 235.67 A: (( [cough] )) 

240.54 241.55 A: right 

240.95 253.10 B: uh you know and then uh being able to be honest uh to to discuss those things or you know at least talk about 'em so that each uh person can you know accept it 

252.42 253.69 A: right 

253.17 259.60 B: and um you know and and if you're honest i think if you know let's say if they're not uh the person i'm with 

259.56 265.19 B: says that you know they prefer doing this or that and i don't find to be 

265.08 270.97 B: in agreement with it you know i'm glad that they were honest sharing that with me um 

270.77 282.87 B: you know and i have to be honest in letting them know that hey that's you know not part of my forte here and you know i can't accept that and if this is what you wanna continue doing then you know i couldn't be with that person 

282.40 285.02 A: i see i see yeah 

285.01 290.59 A: my philosophy on that since we've got this ten minutes i wanna share mine with you too and we 

289.89 290.95 B: please do 

290.57 303.20 A: go back and forth uh my philosophy and some people may criticize it and some people may not it's been one that's kinda helped me in this recent relationship that i'm in at this time uh 

301.85 302.92 B: (( mhm [cough] )) 

303.06 316.61 A: my new philosophy is whether it's good or bad this is what i believe that to be in a relationship one has to accept that there's going to be a great deal of suffering 

316.66 319.97 A: uh there's going to be a great deal of suffering 

319.86 324.67 A: as far as having to listen to somebody's mouth when you don't wanna listen to it 

324.33 325.37 B: (( mhm )) 

324.46 333.79 A: there's going to be a great deal of having to swallow your pride when you wanna correct somebody when they say something because you know that you're right and you wanna 

333.58 347.76 A: correct them but you can't do it because if you correct them every time you think you're right you're going to be correcting them all the time and it's going to be hard to get along you know so in my situation with the woman i'm involved with now 

343.33 344.50 B: (( mhm [cough] )) 

348.07 357.04 A: i do a lotta pride swallowing i do a lotta listening to the conversations i don't feel like listening to and i do a lotta that because 

357.32 367.34 A: i weigh that with the fact that i like her company she's a cute lady and i get along with her and we get to run around and go to the movies together and all this kinda stuff 

366.87 368.10 B: (( mhm )) 

367.48 378.86 A: uh it's kinda like a bargain i'm kinda making with myself you know i've been through a couple of marriages and got married 'em and divorced 'em a couple of times so 

370.26 370.82 B: (( [cough] )) 

378.63 379.73 B: okay 

379.63 393.24 A: this one is kinda based on some reflections from that you know if i were to say the most convenient thing as far as being compatible the most compatible woman that i know shows up for thirty minutes comes over and we 

382.91 383.74 B: uh-huh 

393.04 404.50 A: make love and then she goes home and i don't have to see her until we do that again that's really compatible but i don't know of any compatible human being like that other than like a 

398.40 399.57 B: uh-huh 

404.51 407.07 A: like a prostitute or something like that so 

405.90 410.59 B: yeah right yeah that's asking an an awful lot 

407.56 408.55 A: [laughter] 

408.67 413.98 A: yeah that's asking maybe a little bit more than the average woman is willing to give you know 

411.94 412.81 B: (( uh-huh )) 

413.75 420.79 A: so this is kinda like the the tit for tat i'm you know the thing i'm willing to trade she needs somebody to talk to 

420.58 431.60 A: and not necessarily to correct her but just somebody to listen to her so i trade that for the companionship and the you know being not being lonely or this or that you know 

431.38 432.29 B: right 

431.41 436.39 A: and and also i'm accepting it so as far as compatibility 

436.97 440.55 A: i try to look at what they bring to the table you know 

440.69 450.43 A: if they have a nice sense of humor if they have this or that whatever they have that's a good quality i take that and on that and really appreciate that part 

450.10 451.27 B: right 

450.61 455.39 A: and and try and that a lotta times when i focus on the great part of it 

455.23 462.64 A: the bad stuff don't matter as much then or it it becomes lesser to the point at least where i can deal with it 

462.40 475.66 A: and it it all depends on if i wanna go along with this thing or not it's so much easier in this day and age to just say the hell with it and i'm gonna just go pay somebody fifty bucks or something like and be done with all of this ridiculousness 

475.31 476.46 B: (( yeah )) 

476.06 483.10 A: that sounds easy but then i think life ain't about just being easy all the time you know 

482.45 483.85 B: right right 

483.26 492.52 A: so what if you have some hard times you know at least you'd be a better man or something maybe or something like that that's so that's my take on it now i can you 

491.93 492.87 B: uh-huh 

492.67 493.48 A: know 

493.37 506.82 B: yeah well i i can appreciate that uh you know the the suffering part you know i mean it's uh [mn] and and i know that uh you know a long a long time ago my dad had said uh you know that what makes a relationship is uh 

497.43 498.32 A: yeah 

506.83 521.62 B: uh being able to compromise you know and i guess you know you're you're gonna have that suffering you can uh swallow the pride but [mn] you know i i guess you know for for minor things you know i mean everybody has their faults 

509.25 510.12 A: right 

515.34 516.24 A: yeah 

519.77 520.59 A: right 

521.24 522.30 A: right 

521.71 533.38 B: and um you know i know that you know there's there's there's no sense of [mn] you know picking on somebody or or like you were saying like correcting them you know because let's say if you're 

531.09 532.08 A: mhm 

533.39 546.93 B: setting a good example showing a good example then you know that that will probably rub off on that person um you know also eventually you know as as long as what they're doing isn't you know 

540.42 541.29 A: right 

547.18 556.28 B: ir- irritating me to a point where you know i get you know totally worked up over it you know 'cause that's that's one of the things i you know 

552.19 553.58 A: right right 

556.32 569.45 B: i don't i don't wanna have that grief in in my life where you know i'm bottling things up uh to the point where you know it's affecting me uh p- physically and mentally you know um 

565.20 566.15 A: right 

567.56 568.48 A: yeah 

569.68 571.23 A: well i i 

570.31 580.99 B: you know i'm look- i'm i'm looking now you know there's no there's no question about it i'm i'm um you know keeping my you know i've i've got some health issues i have to deal with uh 

572.71 573.52 A: uh-huh 

580.60 581.69 A: right 

581.16 582.90 B: air and um 

583.24 585.52 B: you know i'm just in a situation where 

586.08 599.95 B: you know i definitely uh you know want want to be in a relationship with with somebody and uh also i just i i don't wanna like sell myself short you know i'm i'm uh you know there's like 

596.90 597.97 A: right
