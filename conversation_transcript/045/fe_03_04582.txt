94.77 95.80 B: really 

95.33 107.91 A: wasn't really [mn] yeah it was a work thing some- someone [mn] that the work bought uh they rented out the theater the morning before it opened and uh so we all went or some of us went anyway 

101.05 101.89 B: oh 

104.91 106.19 B: yeah 

107.67 119.34 B: yeah i haven't seen i haven't seen that i kind of regret having seen it seems like when a movie comes here i kind of think well maybe that would be nice to go to it and then when i finally get around to oh i think i'll go tonight it's gone again 

119.16 128.21 A: yeah yeah we we we're we're sl- we're a little slow sometimes if it weren't even before we had the kid if it if it weren't for the second run theaters i think we would've missed a lot of 

119.73 120.61 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

128.24 132.33 A: [sigh] y- you know the ones where where it's three bucks and that 

131.67 133.51 B: yeah oh yeah yeah 

132.87 136.54 A: at least it stays there you know twice as long [laughter] 

136.15 140.44 B: yeah yeah i guess so last one i went to was the lord of the rings i like that sort of thing [noise] 

140.18 142.65 A: yeah that was that was uh 

142.79 154.20 A: that was good we saw that um there's a i live in seattle and there's a a big theater called cinerama that they that has like the best sound system and the biggest screen and stuff it's an old theater that somebody re did and we 

154.32 157.16 A: went to to the cinerama to see that 

156.51 158.14 B: oh yeah 

157.53 159.70 A: i did well it was a little long [laughter] i 

159.72 165.57 B: really i didn't mind i didn't mind it if i get interested in something i don't mind how long it is well within reason 

160.99 162.02 A: didn't mind 

165.80 168.89 A: well [mn] i think it's over three hours [laughter] 

168.03 169.92 B: i didn't even notice [laughter] 

169.75 172.31 A: which i'm not sure counts as within reason 

172.01 174.11 B: yeah well i don't know i suppose 

174.43 177.25 B: uh i i guess i just like that sort of thing 

177.78 181.41 B: or [sigh] 'cause sometimes i can get bored within twenty minutes 

178.70 179.79 A: you said you were 

181.33 182.52 A: yeah 

181.90 185.04 B: but i mean if i think i could be bored within twenty minutes i don't go 

184.62 187.02 A: [noise] yeah but sometimes y- you don't know 

186.76 189.89 B: [sigh] yeah that's true yeah 

189.24 191.19 A: did you see the original matrix 

190.96 192.67 B: no i didn't [sigh] 

192.11 194.28 A: so it's actually uh 

194.29 207.87 A: like one thing i try to do when i'm trying to pick which movies to watch at home versus [noise] which ones to go see is i i try if you're out like if it's like some things like the matrix the the images are so important you know the special effects are what you're seeing it for 

206.62 207.65 B: yeah 

207.75 209.11 B: yeah 

207.85 211.42 A: so then it's then it's worth going and going to the theater to see it [noise] [noise] 

211.34 225.50 B: yeah i've heard the i've heard a lot about the special uh effects in the matrix [sigh] yeah that's the ones you wanna see in the theater if i wanted to wait you know i i watch some movies on t._v. you know it's okay but uh if it's got a lot of special stuff going on it's not the same 

225.35 231.29 A: uh-huh so you so you do did you rent the matrix or not [noise] not even that you're not not a big not a big 

229.78 239.41 B: no well i don't rent movies actually i thought this was a very strange topic for me [laughter] because i don't have a d._v._d. player or a v._c._r. i just watch it if it comes on the regular tv [laughter] 

238.56 241.00 A: i see you're not a not a movie fan 

239.41 249.30 B: i'm not much of a t._v. [laughter] or a movie fan no [sigh] so uh you know if i saw by the time anything comes on the regular t._v. it's usually pretty old because i don't have cable either 

248.67 257.76 A: yeah i get a little like i get a little crazy watching i don't like things that are edited and they they edit them and i go crazy watching the commercials 

249.33 250.37 B: [laughter] 

257.61 259.86 B: oh yeah commercials can be pretty 

260.16 262.15 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

260.99 262.79 A: you should at least get yourself a tivo 

262.75 274.92 B: i should [laughter] yes i suppose i should i keep thinking about it you know ev- you know everyone else has all these special t._v. and movie type things and i keep thinking one of these days i'll get it and somehow i'm never quite motivated 

274.70 275.50 A: uh-huh 

275.29 276.05 B: [laughter] 

275.99 277.93 A: so you don't even own a v._c._r. you 

277.50 278.85 B: no never did 

278.54 282.16 A: must be like in the the the the two percent or what [laughter] 

281.74 284.91 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] i don't know anyone else that doesn't own a v._c._r. )) 

284.09 286.55 A: yeah my i mean my grandfather has a v._c._r. 

286.10 290.56 B: [laughter] yeah well my grandparents didn't but then again they were uh th- 

290.89 293.10 B: they didn't watch much t._v. either [laughter] 

293.94 303.34 B: uh you know i don't know it's uh i don't know why i never bothered well just like i said i put it off i think well that'll be nice i'll think about that you know one of these days and i never actually get around to doing it 

303.54 305.15 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

304.17 310.06 B: [laughter] you can see where a t._v. and movie watcher don't come on my list of priorities right [laughter] 

308.60 309.51 A: uh-huh 

310.81 312.64 A: yeah you're not y- yeah you've ma- 

312.01 313.28 B: [laughter] 

313.29 317.46 A: how the how about there being a button that says no don't ask me this question 

317.62 318.43 A: [laughter] 

318.48 321.60 A: (( i'm not i'm i'm thinking maybe you've [laughter] )) 

322.22 326.40 A: so we haven't the other problem we've had is uh do you know about netflix 

327.04 329.69 B: well i know you can download videos and stuff from the 

328.76 334.35 A: this isn't this isn't downloading it isn't illegal it's you you pay twenty bucks and they mail the movies to you 

334.19 335.89 B: oh no i haven't heard about that 

335.69 340.09 A: and you can you can get as many movies as you want they're mailed on d._v._d. 

339.58 341.94 B: oh uh oh like a book club only movies [laughter] 

341.64 346.05 A: uh y- well except and you have to return them but you just return them in the mail more more like 

345.16 347.06 B: oh i see yeah 

346.44 348.79 A: more like a movie library by mail 

349.05 352.20 B: oh no no i haven't heard about that it makes sense though really doesn't it 

352.28 353.35 A: (( uh )) 

352.73 354.56 B: you know if you watch a lot of movies 

353.90 362.81 A: well you don't have to watch that many i'm well i mean by by most people's standards [laughter] [laughter] it's twenty bucks a month so if you're gonna watch you know a movie a week 

357.48 358.96 B: [laughter] 

359.10 360.36 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

362.25 364.27 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

362.73 374.48 A: then it's uh uh but we had that for a while and and we just we spent a whole month without watching a single movie and realised y- you get fat 'cause we can only watch them when the kid is sleeping when the kid's sleeping we 

373.77 374.75 B: right 

374.77 377.10 A: we'd rather be doing something else [noise] 

377.17 384.43 B: oh yeah when you got when you [laughter] when you got a small youngster uh yeah that does cut into your time a lot i would think 

384.17 385.78 A: y- you don't have kids do you 

385.21 387.44 B: no i don't have kids but uh 

387.95 393.88 B: i i know i i i kinda know what it's like and [laughter] by the time you get the baby to sleep 

393.80 394.85 A: (( yeah )) 

394.08 397.34 B: (( sometimes it's sometimes the only thing you want to do yourself is sleep )) 

397.61 400.00 A: or cl or clean up the mess 

398.26 400.01 B: or clean house or 

400.19 404.22 B: yeah [laughter] yeah yeah i 

400.29 401.37 A: yeah 

404.28 406.88 B: i did a lot of babysitting and whatnot in my time 

407.61 410.17 A: [sigh] so what are you doing if you're not watching movies then 

409.90 411.52 B: i read books a lot 

410.85 415.11 A: a lot of books [sigh] but but never the books that get turned into movies 

412.24 413.10 B: (( uh )) 

415.20 424.03 B: i avoid those [laughter] i i i have really found that if you get a book turn it into a movie they never do it right you know they never have my vision of what the main character looks like or 

423.92 425.15 A: (( yeah )) 

424.50 427.19 B: [laughter] or they leave out all my favorite bits 

427.44 428.29 A: yeah they 

427.50 430.86 B: [sigh] and lord of the rings is an exception i did enjoy that 

430.49 434.57 A: but that's p- partially 'cause it's 'cause it's so long that they put all the bits in 

434.13 436.87 B: well they left out a good bit [laughter] 

436.28 449.05 A: well like for instance i heard originally when they were gonna make that they wanted to do all three the en- the entire trilogy was going to be one movie and um the guy they found to direct it or produce it said no no no it has to be three movies not one 

443.57 445.06 B: (( oh you couldn't do that )) 

449.11 452.77 B: (( yeah i you wouldn't have gotten it all in i'm i just y- )) 

451.25 459.92 A: yeah well that's but like it's o- you know it's only by accident that it's long enough to ha- to to have the parts you like you know what i'm saying 

459.31 463.61 B: yeah yeah that mostly they have to take out parts when they make something into a movie 

462.96 466.07 A: unless they unless they make it into three movies instead of one 

465.48 472.75 B: [laughter] yeah and another thing they do sometimes is they take bits out of different books like um 

472.86 480.29 B: oh dick francis's uh detective stories they made a bunch of those into made for t._v. movies which you've probably never seen 'cause they're really bad and 

479.59 480.50 A: okay 

480.10 489.62 B: [laughter] and they and it was very disconcerting if you read the books because they took a bit out of this book and a bit out of that big book and a bit of a third book and dumped it all together 

487.60 488.91 A: i see yeah that would 

489.74 496.04 A: yeah that would actually drive i'd be it's like one thing to have parts missing it's it's even worse to uh 

490.23 491.81 B: oh [laughter] 

496.33 499.12 A: oh and you've never you haven't seen the harry potter movies have you 

498.68 500.43 B: oh yeah 

499.82 501.11 A: did you read the books 

500.63 505.80 B: y- um i've read most of them actually i got them for the kids daughter of a friend of mine [laughter] 

502.68 503.90 A: yeah so i have but 

505.57 508.25 A: i thought they did a good job of making those ones in into 

507.58 512.15 B: oh yes they're excellent they didn't leave very much out and they ha- and they kept the feel 

512.09 514.70 A: yeah uh 

513.95 514.80 B: (( [cough] )) 

514.97 517.28 B: excuse me yeah yeah that was uh 

518.56 526.49 B: yeah yeah they did a good job on them let's is that all that i've seen lately [laughter] i think it's harry potter and it shows i'm into fantasy this year if nothing else 

526.98 528.79 B: harry potter and lord of the rings 

528.89 531.09 A: and what e- and have you seen anything else 

530.51 537.02 B: uh can't remember off hand i don't think so not not real recently um 

537.33 541.23 B: i was thinking about going to the matrix and i haven't got to it yet famous last words 

540.63 553.48 A: it's it's probably worth it's not the the matrix reloaded isn't as good as the original but uh the s- you know the s- the special e- i mean it has like one of the world's best car chase scenes and you know even if you don't care about car chase scenes it's still 

541.87 542.87 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

545.33 546.91 B: uh-huh uh 

553.48 557.47 A: it's still really cool to watch a motor cycle going the wrong way on a highway 

556.86 559.60 B: m- [laughter] yes i suppose it would be 

560.00 561.13 A: (( uh [sigh] )) 

560.49 567.22 B: yeah and i was thinking about seeing that one from england uh bend it like beckham that sounds interesting i r- i heard about that on t._v. 

567.35 568.42 A: huh yeah 

567.36 568.64 B: about uh soccer 

568.74 572.14 B: not that i'm much into soccer but it sounds like an interesting the 

571.25 576.68 A: oh yeah i remember um i didn't hear about the movie but i i heard something about the person 

577.00 578.08 A: uh 

577.48 580.02 B: person who made it or the person one of the actors on 

578.64 583.96 A: no b- beckham the the no the uh the person who th- th- it's about a sports star who 

583.65 585.13 B: yeah 

584.25 592.77 A: and i heard something about the s- the star about how he how he can basically do a curve ball um at soccer which no one else can do 

592.28 593.08 B: (( uh [sigh] )) 

593.60 595.77 A: that's what the t- the t- that's the bend in it 

594.72 597.16 B: yeah that's what the title refers to yeah 

596.52 597.74 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

597.90 599.89 A: uh it does sound
