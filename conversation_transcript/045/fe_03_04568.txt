236.40 242.11 A: yeah [laughter] i saw it a couple of years ago and i don't re- even remember it but my husband went 

242.32 252.32 A: last night and saw it and he really liked it but i haven't the other one i saw so long ago that i don't even remember it so i it wasn't you know it's all hype right now [lipsmack] 

252.78 255.14 A: to see it but i didn't go see it 

255.25 256.16 A: um 

256.36 264.02 A: [laughter] the only reason i keep bringing this back to the movies is because they try and get you talk on the same subject for [sigh] at least eight of the ten minutes 

264.23 265.17 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

264.59 266.06 A: (( [laughter] but [laughter] )) 

266.08 268.29 A: how did you hear about the fisher study 

268.73 269.87 B: my wife [mn] 

270.49 272.17 B: (( all i know is she [mn] )) 

270.63 271.48 A: yeah 

272.38 277.52 B: found out about it that said if i talk to a stranger for ten minutes they'd give me ten dollars so [noise] [noise] 

277.22 280.40 A: yeah plus if she referred you 

281.01 283.53 A: when you signed up for it she can get 

283.68 288.67 A: a referral fee for e- every a dollar for every person she refers [lipsmack] 

288.94 297.69 A: um but right now they're only taking they're only paying the referral fee if the person that's referred is a man 'cause i guess they need a whole bunch of male voices 

297.43 299.66 B: that must be why they keep calling me 

299.86 302.38 A: yeah maybe i think that 

301.21 304.78 B: because it was supposed to be three and they've called me like five times so far 

304.72 312.41 A: that's awesome that's great if you can 'cause i did my three but cell phone was hooked up for my husband too like we 

312.51 314.47 A: we had we had our cell phone is 

314.57 320.54 A: the number on both of ours and i've been called so many times but a lot of times i'm i don't 

320.80 323.52 A: where i live my phone doesn't ring 

323.54 332.84 A: so um a lot of times i've missed it and then i've checked my voicemail and it's oh you know it's the robot lady asking for someone to participate [laughter] 

332.12 333.81 B: (( [noise] mm right [noise] )) 

333.51 343.68 A: so i think i've done it like five times but one time [noise] i was on my cell phone [sigh] and i went through a a no zone area and i'd talked for almost ten minutes 

343.65 356.25 A: and it all of a sudden my phone disconnected on me i felt so bad for the person that i was talking to 'cause i don't think they got their ten dollars so this time when it called me i'm pulled over now so that i won't lose the signal 

347.28 348.50 B: (( [noise] oh yeah [laughter] )) 

352.37 353.78 B: (( right [noise] )) 

355.74 356.58 B: (( [laughter] ))
