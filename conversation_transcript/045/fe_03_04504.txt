17.75 23.54 A: okay you're across the coast um i'm from ah ah arlington virginia 

23.06 24.15 B: oh okay

34.79 35.84 B: uh-huh 

37.65 42.24 B: so ah what do you think about the public schools in in america 

41.32 45.36 A: um boy yeah it's really a big question isn't it um 

45.82 47.86 A: i i i don't i um 

48.93 52.01 A: i i i guess like there's like the usual 

52.46 56.92 A: like it seems kind of constant problem of like this of having teacher funding 

57.39 62.73 A: um and so on is w- w- w- one of the big problems i think in public schools 

62.95 69.78 A: is like that it kind of stifles creativity there's like lots of r- learning but there's none 

70.32 77.03 A: it it's it just kind of seems like a lot of things are being taught just because it was taught before and just not a lot of justification for it being taught 

78.19 88.26 A: um i mean i'll i'll e- e- e- e- e- e- e- e- e- e- e- elaborate more but w- what are your thoughts on it um on the question mm 

88.75 91.25 B: (( [lipsmack] well ah personally )) 

91.60 92.99 B: um 

93.57 100.51 B: i've got a book ah by bill bennett on the social trends in the united states 

100.35 101.56 A: mhm 

101.10 110.63 B: and ah it's kind of interesting because when you go through and ah look at the founding of this country we were founded on biblical principles 

110.51 116.67 B: and ah this the people who came here and settled in this country had the bible 

116.69 124.36 B: as the only book that they had and and ah they taught their children the bible because that's the only book they had in the home 

124.58 133.45 B: and that was on the only book that was used in the schools that started here and out of that they were taught history and geography and english 

133.53 135.82 B: i- you know and then um 

135.72 142.95 B: we've i think there was in the duffy's reader or something was developed after that and probably math books and everything but everything centered around the bible and the 

142.95 152.43 B: the the godly moral principles of the bible and then we got to an age where we ah started d- you know state schools 

152.47 154.64 B: and separated ah 

154.64 168.40 B: you know the things of god out of the school system and then in the sixties we outlawed the ten commandments we outlawed the bible and outlawed prayer in school and when i look at this ah book of social indicators from ah 

168.73 178.03 B: bill bennett it shows ah all the different things like teen pregnancy and ah suicide drug abuse and all this stuff 

178.09 190.22 B: of ah teenagers it's kind of a flat line but in nineteen sixty two when it just skyrocketed straight up everything is ah increased ah 

190.24 197.05 B: unbelievably it's like when we kicked god out of the school there was a moral vacuum 

196.86 210.62 B: and ah immorality filled that vacuum and now kids are just you know crime and violence and and just there's no moral compass anymore for kids and now we teach secular humanism we teach evolution 

210.43 215.77 B: which is ah scientifically being proven to be debunked 

215.78 222.16 B: the more scientifically advanced we get the more we realize how impossible evolution is 

221.15 225.95 A: mhm if a- a- a- where've you heard that evolution is in um 

226.09 228.53 A: is being scientifically debunked 

228.74 233.71 B: well like ah mike beahey's book darwin's black box 

233.88 238.35 B: if you read that book he's the one that professes at u._c. berkeley 

238.58 248.49 B: and ah he's the ah ah microbiologist and when we get down to looking at the simplest life forms that exist 

248.54 259.03 B: and see how completely complex they are it is impossible for something that is non living to become living 

259.08 271.67 B: it's totally impossible because the complexity of the simplest living cell is so complex it's impossible for life to arrive from non life 

271.90 275.56 A: well i- d- d- do ah you consider a virus life 

272.12 273.30 B: so i- 

275.81 276.88 B: pardon me 

276.45 281.39 A: ah do the e- e- e- you consider a virus life 

282.76 284.16 B: consider what 

283.64 287.19 A: (( ah a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a virus )) 

288.44 291.27 B: a virus oh yeah sure 

289.09 290.01 A: yes 

291.50 293.05 B: of course it's a life 

293.11 298.44 A: well i i i mean like w- w- like here's w- what's your definition of something that's not life 

298.54 313.14 B: well o- something that's life is something that takes in energy and ah y- from its surroundings and converts converts something from the surroundings into energy and ah and reproduces itself 

315.27 320.39 B: like a virus a virus would be a a a a a living organism 

320.16 326.24 A: yeah b- i i i guess it's like y- you you you you you say that it was impossible for something that's not living 

326.27 332.36 A: to kind of make the jump to something that's living i g- i guess w- w- w- what what's something that you think it's 

328.80 330.27 B: right 

332.73 340.70 A: i mean i i i i i i i i don't see the gap really between the non living and and living 

340.57 346.59 B: well i would u- i would urge you to get the book darwin's black box by by beahey 

346.78 349.95 B: and ah read it and tell me and then ah 

349.84 361.60 B: rethink your position about it but anyways the point being is when we ah took god out we replaced it with evolution which i think it's eighty six percent of americans believe in god 

361.48 371.88 B: so you've got a very small minority of people ruling the education system and putting forward their agenda which is humanism which the supreme court determined was a religion 

371.96 379.17 B: so it's not a matter of e- the matter is which religion is going to be promoted the religion of secular humanism 

379.11 393.91 B: or the religion of of of god but the point i'm trying to make here is we've got ah a school system that's morally bankrupt that that's producing kids that are the drop out rate is just is like like it's thirty percent 

394.08 401.25 B: and the kids who are in school are are are aimless they don't have ambition they don't have goals they don't have direction 

401.24 411.96 B: and we've got ah this this problem it's like a vacuum it's ah in you know we've got to well the answer is always well throw more money at the problem 

411.91 423.26 B: that's not the answer i i myself s- pay forty percent of my tax dollars goes to support the public education system in california 

423.22 426.97 B: forty percent in fact now i get some revised ah 

427.10 428.41 B: fifty percent 

428.27 439.17 A: mm yeah i it's like you s- are are you sure it's going dir- all directly through to education i mean like most most state taxes like they may take fifty percent of your money but some goes to social services 

428.49 429.76 B: fifty percent 

438.61 444.50 B: no no no i'm saying fifty percent of the tax revenue 

444.74 453.87 B: in the state of california is spent directly on the public education system that is a matter of fact 

453.26 465.94 A: well i- i i'm ah ah d a a a a a a a a a a a a you know how that compares with other states like with what what what what's the average i mean i i i think i think it just a- it's kind of important to have like like a baseline of what 

460.09 461.11 B: no i don't 

465.68 474.92 B: no but my point my point is that at ah i've b- i pay taxes into the system every day i've made pretty close to a million dollars now 

466.40 467.65 A: what normal is 

474.92 483.41 B: and i've paid in probably f- i don't know how many thousands and thousands of dollars into the into the tax system as a citizen 

483.49 494.57 B: but yet i can't ah have the right to put my daughter in a in a private school and use my money that i've paid into the system to support her 

494.35 504.12 B: through choice in education i have to reach into my pocket and pay out another four hundred and fifty dollars a month which forces me to go in debt 

504.09 516.69 B: to put my daughter in a school of my choice so she gets a decent education in a safe environment that teaches the godly principles that i stand by and believe i and live by 

516.63 522.40 B: and to me that's unjust in that the real issue is that a- another issue here is that 

522.24 533.47 B: that the education system that she's in which is consistently puts out kids with a higher grade point average and higher higher ah 

533.33 542.57 B: um ah scoring on the s._a._t. tests across the board they do it for half the money that the public school system does it for 

543.64 544.57 A: oh 

543.74 546.39 B: they get twice the education for half the money 

546.88 559.14 A: i and ah it it sounds like more like you're for school vouchers which i- i it i mean like f- for a- the it's kind of a different issue then like whether god should be in the school or not or if 

551.69 552.54 B: oh 

558.82 565.81 B: well we're talking about public edu education so um i'm just saying that p- to me public education is bankrupt 

565.87 568.55 A: (( yeah i mean i i i i i )) 

568.34 578.11 A: i i i i i i i i i i i i don't think it's as bad as as as you see it i mean i i i i think there's some problems specifically there's 

577.88 584.68 A: (( well i i i i i i i i a person like a a a a a a a foo- a a a a )) 

578.06 579.48 B: well i'll tell you i 

584.58 594.73 A: a lot of the drop in student achievement it's it's directly f- related to parents not having enough time to spend with the kids either by choice or they're having to work more 

594.48 599.89 B: well i'll tell you the like comparing comparing the two christian to to public
