55.34 56.74 A: (( i hear ya )) 

56.22 57.38 B: yeah 

56.83 65.19 A: so uh you know uh i i actually think that uh for my way of thinking i prefer uh just renting a movie and seeing it at home 

64.98 67.50 B: yeah it really chafes my head like that 

66.91 70.86 A: i think it's like you know um more convenient too 

71.12 75.56 A: you know you don't have to be running all around looking for a um 

75.59 76.18 B: (( [noise] )) 

75.65 83.43 A: [mn] a seat you know and uh you don't have people annoying you uh with cell phone calls and 

80.42 81.62 B: yeah 

82.64 84.47 B: yeah 

83.57 90.21 A: all the rest of that so uh i i really like that not only that if you wanna have you know your popcorn you can have it ready before ya 

89.90 91.15 B: exactly 

90.35 97.32 A: watch the movie and you don't have to be running out there and have somebody save your seat and stand in line 

95.06 95.94 B: uh-huh 

97.45 98.67 B: yeah 

97.49 100.50 A: and and it's a lot less expensive as well 

99.81 104.13 B: oh gosh in l._a. it costs like ten dollars for a movie ticket 

103.46 105.89 A: i know that's that's crazy isn't it 

104.84 106.94 B: is it like that there too in raleigh 

106.78 110.58 A: no uh it right now it's costing about seven dollars 

110.32 111.34 B: uh-huh 

110.98 114.92 A: but you can go in the late afternoon for about 

114.98 119.46 A: um i think it's like five fifty or something like that 

119.43 120.38 B: uh-huh 

119.53 121.36 A: the five twenty five show 

120.52 122.09 B: oh yeah the matinee 

121.49 122.76 A: yeah the matinee 

122.80 128.22 A: so that's not bad but you know you still have to park and you have to stand in line for your tickets 

125.65 126.74 B: yeah 

127.62 131.56 B: well my thing is i prefer to consume drugs while i watch movies 

130.97 132.45 A: well you know 

131.65 133.26 B: and um and um 

132.84 135.07 A: you can't do that in the movie theaters can you 

134.75 138.61 B: yeah and you know they're always you know other other uh 

135.53 136.45 A: so 

138.67 142.59 B: other movie watchers are always complaining about my drug use and um 

142.10 143.04 A: uh-huh 

143.11 144.59 A: yeah so 

143.24 146.53 B: yeah so that that's another reason i like to be at home too 

145.81 150.47 A: yeah well that i think that works out a lot better for you right yeah yeah a 

148.67 152.25 B: yeah yeah a lot less risk of being arrested too 

152.03 162.11 A: a whole lot less risk right yeah except except if you have friends friends watching with you and one of 'em doesn't like um drug use and they call the cops on ya yeah 

153.48 154.75 B: yeah 

160.62 165.15 B: yeah oh that's yeah that happened to me last night that's a big problem

166.00 167.09 B: yeah 

166.46 176.47 A: [laughter] well then in that case i guess if you're gonna continue that habit you probably need to um uh be careful who you invite right yeah uh

345.94 347.92 B: as good as it gets okay 

351.32 361.24 A: he decides that he r- he wants to start taking medicine for the um o._c._d. because this um his love for this particular woman 

361.00 368.14 A: encourages him to uh do better and to uh learn to handle things in a better way 

367.82 368.78 B: mhm

403.23 407.71 A: you missed right well that's it as good as it gets because if you like jack nicholson 

404.21 405.13 B: yeah 

407.44 408.71 B: yeah 

408.10 409.56 A: you'll love that movie 

409.28 423.39 B: yeah i live in um hollywood and they make a lot of movies around here but the actual movie stars don't live around here you know they all live like in beverley hills but in hollywood but you do see like lots of sets and stuff and 

411.07 412.23 A: yeah 

412.75 413.68 A: (( yeah )) 

415.20 416.70 A: uh yeah 

417.84 419.14 A: right 

422.65 423.51 A: uh-huh 

423.59 425.82 B: and uh it's kinda interesting 

425.19 428.11 A: right what did you like about one flew over the cuckoo's nest 

428.29 429.21 B: well 

429.84 437.14 B: i've i've always kinda felt like i was victimized by uh people that question my mental health you know and uh 

435.18 436.46 A: yeah uh-huh 

437.31 443.95 B: and i've been like i remember growing up uh teachers would always try and accuse me of like having emotional or mental problems 

443.35 444.17 A: uh-huh 

444.64 456.13 B: and they would tell my mom about it and sh- but and like they wanted to do tests and stuff like that but my mom refused because once they determine that you have a certain psychological problem 

449.73 450.62 A: right 

455.55 456.88 A: mhm 

456.34 457.32 B: um 

457.45 459.16 B: they can use that against you you 

459.18 467.46 A: [mn] but not but i don't think they really do that much any more but certainly in uh one flew over the cuckoo's nest that that was the case wasn't 

459.52 461.36 B: (( know or or )) 

465.91 479.70 B: in a legal situation they do like they can bring up if you've had uh if you've had emotional problems or psychological problems they'll use that they'll bring up that and say look see he's crazy they did it to some guy recently 

468.29 469.54 A: (( it )) 

473.47 474.26 A: (( n- mhm )) 

476.91 478.04 A: mhm 

479.11 480.00 A: yeah 

480.12 487.88 A: but but honestly that that really doesn't happen all that much because i work with people that have problems so it's not really really doesn't happen 

485.45 486.53 B: uh-huh 

487.74 502.74 A: fortunately uh the things that were in one flew over the cuckoo's nest are things that don't happen much any more you know those were the bad old days when uh people that did have uh psychiatric disorders i mean really uh 

491.88 493.54 B: yeah 

494.11 495.18 B: yeah 

503.08 505.63 A: uh they were not treated well you know 

505.34 506.44 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

505.81 511.06 A: i i worked at a hospital for a very brief time where there were back wards just like the one 

510.97 521.62 A: you know um in one flew over the cuckoo's nest and it was really it was the medications back then were awful too you know they just sedated people and and um 

519.41 520.26 B: yeah 

521.44 531.64 A: that was a terrible time but you know what i liked about one flew over the cuckoo's nest the guy uh the guy uh you know he uh [laughter] he uh showed 'em all at the end you know 

524.57 525.94 B: (( mm )) 

532.03 534.57 B: oh the indian guy yeah 

533.01 536.77 A: yeah you know i mean that's the part i liked the best you know 

536.44 538.55 B: yeah i read the book you 

537.58 539.91 A: he rose above it all you know 

539.77 543.95 B: know the book is uh is in first person from the indian's perspective 

542.93 553.43 A: [noise] i know and it's awesome it was an awesome book yes absolutely ken kesey wrote that but uh you know that's what i liked uh that in spite of the system [mn] 

544.32 545.35 B: have you read it 

545.84 547.05 B: yeah it's great 

547.71 548.81 B: yeah 

553.66 562.70 A: which was really really awful back then uh you know uh this guy managed to rise above it so that was a that was an awesome movie 

556.40 557.33 B: mhm 

560.30 561.19 B: yeah 

561.73 564.05 B: well not not uh jack nicholson 

563.93 569.88 A: no but but you know he he uh passed passed on to this other guy the desire to do that 

569.94 570.85 B: yeah 

569.97 573.79 A: you know so he helped somebody else out you know sometimes that's the way it goes 

573.55 575.06 B: like um 

575.35 582.64 B: jack nicholson or is it the character randall mcmurphy he died from it so he didn't really he really didn't rise above it all 

579.52 580.78 A: yes right 

581.83 585.66 A: no he didn't but but h- what he did and what he said 

585.85 589.43 A: um you know contributed to the indian 

589.44 590.26 B: yeah 

589.51 591.16 A: um you know 

591.54 599.89 A: g- leaving being able to get out of there so uh you know i guess it's kinda like one of those situations where jack nicholson uh planted the seeds in this guy 

593.71 594.81 B: uh-huh
