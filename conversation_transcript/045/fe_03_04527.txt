21.47 24.82 B: uh high school yeah ten through twelfth grade 

24.26 25.31 A: (( oh okay )) 

24.98 27.33 B: yeah so 

26.64 30.36 A: yeah i think the college people are still in for a couple more weeks 

29.61 35.21 B: yeah yeah so what's uh what's your thought on affirmative action 

34.54 36.86 A: oh boy there's a [laughter] 

36.89 39.38 A: uh i'm sick so 

39.45 41.94 A: [cough] what's my thought on affirmative action 

42.28 45.33 A: i used to work in the government and um 

45.30 45.86 B: (( [sigh] )) 

45.62 47.74 A: it seemed like there were 

48.61 52.53 A: two strikes against it and one strike for it the two strikes against it were 

52.71 59.24 A: um you know the the normal thing of [cough] uh underqualified people seeming to get jobs 

58.60 59.89 B: mhm 

59.27 62.79 A: and then the second one which is actually more insidious 

62.91 66.93 A: was the perception of underqualified people [laughter] getting jobs 

66.06 67.35 B: (( r- )) 

67.21 72.70 A: and then the one strike for it was i did have a couple of friends who got jobs [cough] um 

72.98 79.97 A: that they were pretty sure they wouldn't have gotten them but these were in the seventies er i'm sorry in uh early eighties 

77.42 78.60 B: (( right [mn] )) 

80.13 89.17 A: uh when there was a lot more discrimination i'm not sure in the nineties which is when i most of my friends were promoted that it had that much of effect anymore 

88.07 89.49 B: (( didn't have that much )) 

89.53 94.94 B: well i'm only twenty four i mean it's silly for me to you know i i 

93.13 93.86 A: yeah 

95.56 105.28 B: uh i know what it is um but honestly i i don't think i'm i see it or you know i'm i'm really exposed to it um 

105.47 109.29 B: uh we have black and white employees 

109.48 115.43 B: um we have black and white students who uh pass all the time who fail all the time so it's 

115.69 117.15 B: (( it uh you know )) 

117.47 118.16 B: ch- 

117.58 122.60 A: i gue- i guess it might be akin to social promotion did did you ever get involved with that or 

122.26 125.17 B: at a social promotion uh 

124.26 126.00 A: yeah within high schools 

126.29 130.74 B: nothing really i just i don't receive promotions 

129.80 135.82 A: [cough] no no no this is for the students or maybe that's no longer current in the late eighties early nineties 

135.88 143.88 A: um [mn] there was a theory prevalent that said that uh um students did better if they stayed with the cohort they started with 

143.48 145.08 B: (( [mn] oh [noise] )) 

144.48 152.61 A: and so even though a student may not be doing well then rather than hold them back they would do what i think the nickname was social promotion 

149.10 149.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

152.04 162.10 B: oh tha- [sigh] unfortunately i gue- you're right i know what you're talking about now that happens every day every year 

162.61 164.25 B: all the time 

164.27 170.71 B: it does we have kids we have kids who should not be graduating but they are 

164.68 166.69 A: [laughter] even now it still happens 

170.95 174.72 B: um in the school i work you 

174.75 178.04 B: can do nothing and pass 

178.38 186.06 B: you have if you have the right code with your name you cannot receive an f. 

186.38 188.03 B: i mean it's 

187.31 188.77 A: what's a code 

188.54 192.48 B: um it's uh well like learning disabled 

192.42 193.60 A: oh okay 

192.91 196.09 B: if you're learning disabled you cannot receive an f 

196.34 197.41 A: (( really [laughter] )) 

196.80 199.94 B: yes and and we have the other codes 

199.96 202.50 B: um like this if you're a girl 

202.80 205.56 B: and you go to an autobody shop 

205.63 210.75 B: that is called against the norm and you receive a code right away 

211.53 215.51 A: oh and and you can't give 'em an f. or something like 

213.87 223.89 B: no not not for that code that code means that the girls cannot sit in the very back of the room they have to be offered the first or second row 

223.77 227.09 A: you're kidding [laughter] 

224.42 225.90 B: no i'm serious 

226.04 237.19 B: you you know if you're a girl and you go and sit in a computer class believe it or not it is against the norm and you'll receive a code where i work 

229.04 229.96 A: [laughter] 

236.98 239.39 A: [cough] wow that's bizarre but where do you teach 

237.94 239.00 B: mhm

250.53 252.55 B: yeah pittsburgh so 

251.75 255.95 A: so it's east coast huh i was thinking that was more like a west coast thing that

256.12 257.71 A: wow [laughter] 

257.12 259.37 B: absolu- -lutely not 

259.05 262.19 A: so they take away a lot of discretion from you guys 

261.72 262.84 B: yes 

263.65 264.47 B: (( they do )) 

263.65 264.44 A: (( oh )) 

264.92 270.14 B: um like you do you do not have to do very well um 

270.74 271.79 B: uh 

272.39 280.40 B: i guess i i you know that's some form of affirmative action for kids in school i would i would guess 

278.73 289.78 A: yeah it's [cough] it's all about trying to i i mean affirmative action seems like a good idea uh it's just it's hard to institutionalize something like that 

289.24 290.14 B: mhm 

290.01 291.14 A: um 

291.15 296.03 A: a- and you know don't feel i mean i'm i'm forty eight so [laughter] um 

294.17 297.09 B: [laughter] i'm only twenty four yeah 

296.39 303.52 A: i went to when i went to high school in kansas and there were a lot of kids that graduated with me that were barely literate [mn] 

303.14 304.40 B: oh wow 

303.80 309.66 A: and you know i think that's always been the case and they promote them you know they go ahead and graduate them because 

305.72 306.28 B: (( mm )) 

309.90 317.37 A: not to would be kind of a s- you know a smear on them and they really are employable they're just not you know they're probably not college bound 

313.96 316.54 B: mhm 

317.41 319.66 A: well they're definitely not college bound [laughter] 

317.47 320.93 B: which is un- unbelievable all right 

320.58 328.77 A: um but i'm trying to remember if we had any w- the teachers had a lot of leeway i think back then whereas you sounds like you don't now [laughter] 

325.48 327.04 B: oh yeah 

328.21 333.36 B: no you absolutely don't do you remember when a teacher could beat your arse with a paddle 

333.28 338.75 A: well yeah they did actually beat my arse with a paddle [laughter] i it was back in those days mm 

335.05 338.25 B: [laughter] i'm just 

338.64 342.80 B: yeah it's uh it's amazing what they can and cannot do 

342.87 344.00 B: um 

344.70 345.66 B: (( uh w- [mn] )) 

345.89 355.50 B: let's say uh okay for the square work it used to be that you had to have a certain grade point average okay a three oh believe it or not [lipsmack] 

356.42 358.09 B: and now 

358.12 359.66 B: it doesn't matter 

360.01 362.36 A: uh this is for for what programme i'm sorry 

361.94 364.52 B: it it's a technical programme 

364.73 368.00 A: and you used to have a three have to have a three oh to be in it 

368.06 368.70 B: (( i )) 

368.91 374.01 B: in the seventies around your your high school years probably 

370.74 371.54 A: oh 

373.41 375.10 A: yeah 

374.13 377.74 B: uh you did the school actually held 

378.04 390.44 B: a very high standing value with uh pitt um c._m._u. and whatnot you can go to this school in the seventies and get journeyman papers 

390.86 397.24 B: i mean that's good and now the school has no accountability like they had 

397.43 398.81 B: nothing 

399.67 410.01 A: yeah i know i'm i am kind of c- uh conflicted a little bit about that though because when i went overseas i was in africa for two years and in in east africa i mean east europe for a while 

406.74 407.73 B: oh wow 

409.43 411.26 B: so you're in the military 

410.68 415.06 A: no no this i was a criminal investigator for um the foreign service 

412.73 413.66 B: (( oh wow )) 

415.21 420.43 A: [cough] we were looking at um [lipsmack] um foreign aid fraud 

419.95 420.64 B: [mn] 

420.96 431.48 A: and but the educational systems there were very rigid and very um you know there was no social promotion they were very rigid very uh structured 

429.16 429.72 B: (( [mn] )) 

431.55 432.79 B: mhm 

432.19 433.70 A: and 

432.87 434.72 B: sort of like japan i think mhm 

434.15 441.05 A: [cough] must must have been and they did turn out you know they were fairly knowledgeable students but um 

441.17 446.76 A: you know it it was funny to compare and contrast them with american educated even if i mean if they were 

446.82 453.26 A: west african native but they'd they'd been educated uh for high school or college in the u._s. 

453.10 463.80 A: they just seemed a lot more creative so i think that's the that's the trade off we're always going to play on here about whether we have standards uh although it does seem a little scary that 

463.77 468.44 A: i don't know somebody like um a surgeon or somebody [laughter] you know or or even a 

466.04 466.91 B: [laughter] 

467.65 481.35 B: we- well i i that i um i don't understand that i mean if if there were an area that you know they had a chance to take affirmative action away totally would definitely be medical 

481.44 482.83 B: definitely 

482.24 484.06 A: yeah does seem like that 

483.48 487.95 B: there's no way i mean that's just not right you know 

488.14 490.86 A: well my backgrounds computer science and i uh 

490.11 492.03 B: well that's that's where i teach 

491.79 493.02 A: [cough] oh really 

492.42 493.70 B: (( yeah i i )) 

493.91 500.20 B: well we have a programme called c._n._e._t. uh computer network engineering technology that's what i do 

500.60 502.33 B: we work with uh t._i._s._c._o. 

502.39 504.33 A: oh that's good stuff 

503.05 503.96 B: (( yeah )) 

503.97 509.80 B: oh yeah yeah in fact my kids just came back from uh the competition in the city of pittsburgh peabody high school 

509.66 510.75 A: really 

510.19 512.62 B: oh yeah 

510.91 513.15 A: had to set up a v._p._n. or something 

512.64 521.62 B: yeah and i'll tell you what we had one kid he uh configured the uh a server in nineteen minutes he did all the subnetting in his head 

521.42 522.43 A: oh my god 

522.20 529.62 B: i'm i'm serious i that's not even the stretch and i said to him i said uh what are you going to do when they go to t._c._p. 

523.95 524.84 A: [laughter] 

529.71 530.94 B: (( i._p. six )) 

531.03 536.09 B: he says well it took me about a minute to do this he said it'll probably take me about five 

536.40 538.39 A: [laughter] 

537.34 540.65 B: (( [laughter] i said okay get out of here what the hell's wrong with you [laughter] )) 

540.52 545.36 A: and he says er er does he do other forms of arithmetic and uh calculation 

543.95 548.59 B: oh that's what we're not real sure of that was asked 

548.63 550.85 B: and someone did ask me 

550.94 557.45 B: uh about that and we we don't know that we don't yeah oh yeah oh yeah 

553.65 555.08 A: that is amazing though 

556.97 562.56 A: i i still have trouble doing t._c._p. i._p. arithmetic uh on paper with my calculator [laughter] 

559.58 560.50 B: [laughter] 

561.66 562.88 B: yeah 

563.17 566.86 B: yeah it's uh it's something he can 

566.91 569.65 B: he can do almost anything he wants 

569.95 572.44 B: with those uh subnetting 

573.80 576.23 B: but there is 

576.25 579.67 B: i don't see affirmative action with computers i mean 

579.48 585.39 A: well um [cough] here here at penn we have probably what uh third 

580.60 581.67 B: i mean mhm
