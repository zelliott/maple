0.00 0.56 B: [noise] 

1.44 2.29 B: hello 

1.69 2.97 A: hello 

2.91 4.10 B: (( [noise] [noise] yes )) 

3.70 5.51 A: uh my name's gregory 

5.47 8.35 B: [noise] hi gregory uh my name is candy 

7.66 9.08 A: uh nice to meet you 

9.59 12.05 A: [sigh] the topic is movies [sigh] 

13.16 14.15 B: (( [noise] [noise] um )) 

13.22 14.26 A: um 

14.62 15.95 A: [lipsmack] the 

14.89 16.62 B: [noise] so what movie did you 

16.65 18.03 B: last see 

17.63 21.05 A: well last week i saw matrix 

21.67 24.49 A: and i saw x. men for the second time 

25.12 28.90 B: [noise] [noise] okay [noise] [noise] uh i saw the matrix [noise] 

26.05 27.30 A: [sigh] what about you 

29.28 31.55 A: awesome wh- which day did you see it on 

29.72 30.49 B: (( [noise] )) 

31.93 33.17 B: yesterday 

32.87 34.96 A: yesterday did you like it 

35.10 40.72 B: [noise] oh yeah yeah i liked it [noise] and then the movie before that was [noise] was cowboy bebop 

40.31 42.98 A: oh i haven't seen that i've heard a lot of good things about it though 

43.69 47.33 B: [sigh] um and both times it was in a theater [laughter] 

46.49 47.48 A: uh-huh 

48.02 57.48 B: um i guess what i don't like about theater is that it's expensive compared to when you could get it on d._v._d. [noise] and [noise] see it in your own home 

57.76 63.03 B: [sigh] but in this time when you go out [noise] with friends and you have to go to the theater [noise] so [noise] 

63.10 64.15 B: (( it's [noise] )) 

65.09 67.78 B: and if you want to see the newest movie 

67.21 69.17 A: yeah of course 

68.62 69.19 B: [noise] 

69.10 82.32 A: [sigh] i really like going to to the movies myself i i don't really like renting movies and going home and watching it i like the whole theater experience with like [sigh] the great sound systems and the huge screens and [sigh] you know the popcorn [noise] and the the [sigh] 

75.75 76.83 B: (( [laughter] )) 

78.15 78.72 B: (( [noise] )) 

78.82 79.39 B: (( [noise] )) 

79.42 80.03 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

82.49 85.69 A: little icies and all that stuff 

85.77 90.27 A: [lipsmack] i think that's what makes it worthwhile to me it's the whole experience itself 

87.17 87.85 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

90.15 95.96 B: [noise] yeah i mean there definitely is [noise] a different experience between [noise] watching it [noise] 

96.08 101.91 B: by yourself [noise] or with a bunch of friends [noise] on uh on your home [noise] instead of with a bunch of uh 

102.04 103.82 B: [noise] it's sort of like a group 

104.02 107.62 B: e- even though they're strangers there you know there's still a lot of people there 

107.07 108.06 A: uh-huh 

107.71 114.07 B: in the theater and and also the the screen is very wide and there are some movies that are very good about 

114.40 117.13 B: [noise] um being conducive to this wide screen 

118.04 119.95 A: like like the matrix 

118.25 119.21 B: (( [noise] um )) 

120.69 135.13 A: like i w- i w- don't think i would appreciate that movie half as much if i saw it on a normal [sigh] home screen [sigh] as i did you know in the in the theater itself with the huge screen [sigh] and the bass rumbling through the theater 

125.62 126.49 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

126.74 127.41 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

135.55 144.42 B: [noise] i actually don't like the loud noise i always take ear plugs [noise] but yeah [laughter] [noise] 'cause uh i don't like 

135.57 136.79 A: and 

139.57 141.09 A: oh really 

142.83 145.92 A: (( i really like it i think you can hear like the subtleties )) 

145.86 159.44 B: [noise] [noise] [sigh] well i i i mean i think when you do see it on the screen it's larger than life [noise] but i i've never really been into like [noise] i don't know something as big as iron mask [noise] i mean 'cause there are several theaters [noise] that will do like the iron mask [noise] three d. 

146.39 147.35 A: that 

150.21 151.39 A: uh-huh 

159.02 160.01 A: uh-huh 

159.67 167.37 B: and i don't really care that much i like the comfy seats [noise] i think if it's like a shitty movie theater then it's not that enjoyable 

166.84 168.62 A: oh yeah i totally agree 

167.37 174.76 B: but y- if if it's like a nice [noise] theater then it it's definitely just part of your evening you [noise] you know it's something to do 

174.89 179.28 B: [noise] and it that makes a difference to me picking the theater [noise] 

179.31 185.11 B: and and though sometimes i just pick the nearest one because they have parking and [noise] um 

185.37 196.72 B: [noise] we can get there on time [mn] usually a ten o'clock show but [noise] a lot of times we [noise] there is just [noise] like cowboy bebop was only playing [noise] in in one particular theater so we had to go there [sigh] 

196.03 197.07 A: uh-huh 

196.68 202.14 B: a- and uh [noise] and then i don't i don't know if it's like far away [noise] so we only have like one running 

202.20 208.90 B: [noise] so there's several times [noise] i also like to watch movies after [noise] the second run [noise] you know how it goes to cheaper theaters [noise] 

208.51 209.48 A: uh-huh 

209.59 213.98 B: and then sometimes um at the college [noise] they're showing films 

214.12 221.59 B: on the wide screen [noise] that are like i don't know three dollars so [noise] like i have to wait you know like i saw harry potter 

221.86 229.66 B: i mean there are kind of like films that i just didn't get to see when they went through the theater and [noise] or maybe i didn't really feel like paying that much [noise] like 

228.94 229.99 A: uh-huh 

229.81 233.43 B: like scooby doo i definitely didn't want to pay like the full price [laughter] 

233.61 235.66 B: (( so [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

234.48 237.98 A: [laughter] i actually saw scooby doo on television the other day 

238.01 246.94 A: like we um [sigh] we have the digital cable yeah so we have i i'd never rent movies any more there's no really need to 

239.83 242.15 B: you have cable [noise] you have 

243.13 243.76 B: (( yeah )) 

247.09 257.56 A: and still i mean i've watched the movies that i missed in the theater that i really didn't care about i'll see those you know if they catch my attention at that point in time [sigh] um i watch a p- a piece here and a piece there 

247.56 248.14 B: (( [noise] )) 

249.45 251.26 B: (( [noise] )) 

254.87 256.06 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

257.98 261.64 A: [sigh] but for i really i go to the movies on opening night 

258.02 258.61 B: (( [noise] )) 

261.09 263.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [cough] [noise] [noise] w- all right )) 

262.06 267.21 A: like i went for i saw matrix on wednesday at midnight [sigh] 

266.34 271.85 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] where so did you wait online or did you buy tickets beforehand 

270.39 273.77 A: i bought tickets on i bought tickets beforehand 

273.67 277.71 B: [noise] well why would it's so necessary to see it on opening night 

277.61 279.12 A: it's just like 

279.95 292.87 A: [sigh] it's to be one of the first people to see it you know it's like [lipsmack] like harry potter and x. men and matrix it's something i've been waiting for a very long really really long time or like lord of the rings 

292.00 292.85 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

292.96 296.75 A: those are all things that like i'm really into so 

297.07 298.10 A: um 

298.52 308.36 A: [sigh] this i've been waiting months and months and in the case of lord of the rings i waited years and i kept up with like the production and everything and then i'm ready to see that movie then and now 

308.39 311.42 A: and [sigh] so i get the tickets early 

310.71 317.22 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] i know but what if you put up so much expectation and then the movie's not very good then [noise] 

316.82 318.05 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

317.49 319.00 B: (( you know [noise] i )) 

318.45 321.07 A: oftentimes you're disappointed but 

320.54 324.03 B: mean and so i went to like monsters like 

324.45 334.36 B: inc [noise] just to see the trailer for star wars and [sigh] you can say the trailer wasn't as good as the movie actually [laughter] the monsters i mean [laughter] so 

327.90 328.90 A: uh-huh 

330.85 332.04 A: [laughter] 

334.65 339.44 A: oh yeah definitely the star wars were a big let down but i waited in line for six hours for tickets 

334.95 335.70 B: but [noise] 

339.91 340.91 A: so 

340.42 342.46 B: oh that's crazy [noise] 

341.33 354.75 A: [laughter] it was fun like i like wait- i thought it was [mn] some of fun to me was like sitting in line with my friends and like [sigh] looking at all the crazy people dressed up and laughing at them and you know 

352.33 353.45 B: (( [noise] [mn] [noise] [noise] )) 

354.79 364.69 A: it that was part of the fun the whole experience for me so it's not actually the movie itself but [sigh] all the [sigh] the institutions surrounding the movie 

364.32 371.60 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm well i don't if [noise] i could get to see [noise] so much spectacle [noise] where i'm living [noise] i mean they probably wouldn't )) 

371.67 375.59 B: dress up [noise] or anything [noise] but no one 

373.61 374.68 A: (( oh )) 

375.61 378.97 B: (( no one [noise] really cares that much [noise] [laughter] )) 

376.78 378.42 A: [laughter] 

378.68 386.30 A: we always have people dressed up like at the matrix there was people in like full costumes running around and [sigh] it was really cool it was really neat 

379.71 381.26 B: [noise] 

384.92 386.42 B: [noise] 

386.43 389.80 A: and of course star wars brings out all the crazies 

389.91 391.64 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

390.16 393.98 A: you know the storm people in full storm trooper ge- gear and 

393.50 399.71 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well i don't i don't know i think that would be very hot in texas and um 

398.41 400.11 A: [laughter] 

400.52 401.42 B: (( so )) 

401.49 405.16 B: yeah and also ever- everyone listening you like you're a bunch of kooks so 

404.46 405.86 A: yeah 

405.42 410.20 B: so when i mean i think they showed it on t._v. [noise] like people like all the lines for 

410.25 414.09 B: (( shows but um [noise] you got to realize it's like [noise] uh )) 

414.22 424.58 B: you know um i mean i did go on the first day [noise] and it was sold out and so i just thought the show that was sold out [laughter] it was like the next one and [sigh] um 

421.07 422.12 A: [laughter] 

424.98 426.36 B: [noise] i don't think they do 

426.52 427.31 A: [sigh] 

427.13 429.07 B: i mean this this [noise] 

429.34 438.47 B: you know the theater actually [noise] it it goes into a second run there's so many second run theaters like where it's like a dollar three dollars five dollars i mean much cheaper 

434.30 435.28 A: uh-huh 

438.27 445.95 B: [sigh] but all you have to do is just wait like two months and [laughter] [sigh] you get to see it some place else cheaper so [noise] 

446.04 447.01 B: um 

446.85 454.05 B: the only one was like titanic [noise] when that was in the second run it it actually lasted a long time [noise] so people kept on coming back 

453.82 465.67 B: [noise] to see that but [noise] it's definitely worth the experience [noise] because when i saw titanic like [noise] the air conditioning was failing [noise] and it was a long movie [noise] and then they finally got the air conditioning [noise] working [noise] but [sigh] um 

460.22 461.38 A: [laughter] oh no 

465.51 474.68 B: [noise] yeah i guess like i don't really have [noise] i think mostly what i do [noise] is go out with my friends is just [noise] go to restaurants or something and so [noise] um 

472.72 473.73 A: (( uh-huh [cough] [sigh] )) 

475.42 476.34 A: [laughter] 

475.59 487.61 B: i mean when i was at u._s._c. [noise] [mn] um we got i saw everything in advance and like [noise] i think right now [noise] they're screening italian job next week [noise] [sigh] so 

488.22 496.31 B: generally i went to there were like three movies a day you could see at u._s._c. [noise] at the film school [noise] if you really cared [laughter] 

496.08 500.42 B: to and [sigh] i go used to just going getting in um 

500.26 502.87 B: late and i would be in the middle of the third 

502.82 509.38 B: the first act of the and just trying to figure out what was going on like [noise] forrest gump i saw i i like walked in [noise] when 

503.80 504.77 A: (( uh-huh [sigh] )) 

509.32 523.33 B: he was like in vietnam and then it it was like this little game where i would like figure out like what's going on so [laughter] [noise] so i did this for like several movies [sigh] going in because there was always a line [noise] um i think cinema majors who [noise] were in the 

523.13 528.97 B: movie class could get in free [noise] and then the cinema majors and then there's like anybody else [sigh] 

528.02 528.99 A: uh-huh 

528.90 541.31 B: so um [noise] but if you go after the lines you could probably just [noise] sneak in anyway so [noise] [sigh] i yeah so i never and i stopped watching movies for a long time because i think film school really just 

541.36 546.33 B: [noise] it makes it really unenjoyable just to sit there and analyze a film all day so 

545.42 547.13 A: uh-huh i understand that [noise] 

546.76 552.48 B: i have to talk for ten minutes on the phone but i can actually walk [noise] sorry [noise] 

553.16 555.29 B: i can walk while i talk [noise] [laughter] 

555.67 566.06 B: no no i just [noise] can walk [laughter] so i stopped because it was just really unenjoyable for me to watch um any kind of films 

566.50 578.79 B: um and i think it's just the same way [noise] that if you go in there and you i mean i i knew people in film who went to film school who just went to movies and just wanted to pick up all the mistakes 

578.50 579.81 A: (( uh-huh [cough] )) 

579.26 593.37 B: and i think that's really unenjoyable too because they would they'd be like oh we watched speed three times and we saw that they had like the wrong bust in here cause it was different and they had the boom showing and [sigh] and everything and i was just like okay you think 

585.31 586.24 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

593.26 599.95 B: is fun you know just keep on going to the movie just to like pick up [sigh] [noise] mistakes in the product-
