10.09 11.60 B: (( hello [noise] )) 

10.74 11.62 A: hello 

12.18 16.54 B: any ah specifics about ah public schools 

16.26 18.40 A: i guess it's just your personal thoughts 

19.10 19.75 B: (( [noise] )) 

20.39 25.45 B: i'm sorry what was that [noise] oh my personal about public schools [cough] 

25.54 27.24 B: in the city of new york 

27.32 30.39 A: um i imagine it's just wherever you are 

30.90 32.48 B: (( well ah )) 

33.15 38.12 B: i'm an old timer and i believe that ah public schools are generated 

38.48 44.96 B: the discipline ah the ability of teachers the quality of everything seems to have gone down 

45.67 47.66 B: also there's [cough] 

47.73 50.67 B: much more lenient with unruly students 

51.05 55.68 B: which don't allow the good students really to flourish in classrooms 

56.36 58.58 B: that's my main thought on that do 

59.09 60.22 A: (( good )) 

59.95 61.37 B: you have an opinion 

61.16 70.45 A: well i i'm actually um from a younger generation and my my fiancee is a teacher and i actually mirror your own thoughts about [cough] 

70.48 71.95 A: (( the public schools )) 

70.58 73.71 B: (( i did did you say you were a teacher [noise] )) 

72.89 74.66 A: no my fiancee is 

74.42 76.87 B: oh okay ah good 

76.18 77.15 A: so 

77.46 87.46 A: i i i actually agree with you in a lot of ways that the the way we used to have teaching er schooling now is seriously in trouble 

87.59 89.74 A: so i i've 

89.80 101.11 A: we have in arizona we have a system in place for testing and it's actually just paying teachers now to make sure the students pass the test much less educating them 

100.72 101.68 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

101.28 104.44 A: um for us it's a bit of a problem 

104.88 109.47 B: i see well we have something similar in new york 

106.13 106.95 A: so 

109.46 110.78 A: um it's 

109.69 115.54 B: but the the quality of of the people going for licenses today 

115.58 120.80 B: have gone down we used to have strict boards at which they had to pass the candidates 

120.94 130.97 B: and they claimed it was discriminatory towards minorities and they watered it down so it's only the state test which is much weaker 

131.43 139.00 B: and so in every which way it looked like they were trying to lower the quality of the incoming teachers 

139.35 143.62 B: and i think that had a dire effect on the schools itself 

144.56 152.58 B: and the discipline policy it's more m- you know all old timers always think it's best in their times 

152.61 159.16 B: but i do remember when i was in lower grades if a child was unruly 

159.40 162.00 B: and he had to bring a parent to school 

162.10 166.04 B: the parent would slap the kid in front of the teacher to show him how 

166.15 168.71 B: she sympathized with the teacher 

169.34 173.24 B: today it's the other way around the teacher gets slapped by the parent 

173.37 184.57 A: yeah well i i don't know i think that if i had my son in school today i would be crucified in every possible way for doing such a thing even though i probably would agree with the teacher it's a 

185.05 188.59 A: different ball of wax all together nowadays 

188.55 191.64 B: yeah i understand it just seems to have gone down 

191.94 199.51 B: and the same parent who cries that the schools are not teaching them is the same parent who won't back up the teacher 

199.76 202.56 B: when there's a dispute like that 

201.79 202.73 A: yeah yeah i 

203.19 204.62 B: (( so ah )) 

205.41 209.53 B: there's enough problems all around but ah when they're 

209.79 214.16 B: all put together ah it makes for a real bad system 

214.69 218.29 B: and here in new york we have an educator a 

218.55 223.17 B: chance to try and to change things the mayor has more control today 

223.91 227.15 B: and ah the situation here is that the unions 

227.22 229.15 B: are more 

229.70 231.74 B: concerned you know with their 

231.96 232.97 B: (( ah )) 

232.86 247.25 B: you know with their salaries and their extra benefits and to worry about what to do to improve the school it sounds like i'm anti teacher but i play sports still play sports and most of the guys i play with are teachers 

244.31 245.51 A: (( yeah hm )) 

248.02 251.80 B: and it seems to me all they talk about is their four oh ones 

252.33 254.55 B: where they're going on their next vacation 

255.40 258.97 B: and it don't seem that much dedication anymore 

259.19 268.93 A: yeah in arizona it's a little different she's we don't we have an open shop state so the unions do exist but they're they don't always have any real power as far as 

268.49 270.03 B: oh oh 

268.98 283.76 A: the teacher unions go not to mention arizona has put in place a system where you could start your own school not even just home school your children but home schooling other children as well with almost no certification requirements whatsoever so 

284.73 292.08 A: the unions have very little power in the state of arizona as far as teacher unions go so we don't share that problem 

292.13 295.71 B: wow i can see that new york is a very strong union town 

292.43 293.29 A: to 

295.46 297.31 A: yeah 

295.95 302.28 B: and they dictate ah the union in the school especially is that's our subject matter 

303.15 308.48 B: wine garden is is very strong she dictates most of the policies it seems 

308.92 311.84 B: ah the chancellors are a little afraid of her 

312.42 321.59 B: and right now in today's paper i was reading you know that they're having a dispute she decides she don't want to go along with the new things anymore 

321.50 332.40 B: and ah we're having a financial problem here and and she's supposed to help out with the unions and they backed down and the mayor wants now to fire 

332.70 347.36 B: ah ah several thousand teacher aides and ah they're screaming that the mayor's racist i don't know if you follow new york politics but huh we're really having a slug fest over here between the union and the mayor and the legislature 

347.57 352.39 B: and ah the sad part about it is the kids are getting the dirty end of it [noise] 

352.34 355.17 A: yeah you're absolutely right it sounds like 

355.36 359.93 A: well everyone's concerned for themselves and not for the children so 

360.65 366.40 A: yeah i we don't have that kind of system out here in arizona it's just 

365.60 367.92 B: yeah it's an open state 

367.56 369.75 A: yeah well it's just 

369.98 376.59 A: there's so many schools now that it's keeping track of it all is is the hardest point 

376.90 377.94 A: they um 

377.66 378.38 B: [noise] 

377.99 387.47 A: our schools are are being judged as failing schools and there seems to be more failing schools than passing ones at least here in the city of tucson so 

387.41 390.97 B: so this seems to be more of a national problem 

390.68 392.16 A: yeah 

391.57 396.29 B: all around that's too bad because today the ah 

396.85 403.53 B: new technology you know all these things and ah we have tough competition all over the world now 

403.72 407.44 B: ah this is a time where we need the brightest minds out there 

408.51 412.64 B: (( and ah you know i'm reading these articles how ah )) 

409.83 410.57 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

412.79 420.95 B: today the world climate it's ah it's europe against the u._s._a. and the u._s._a. against russia and russia's against this and that 

421.00 431.43 B: ah to be competitive we really have to be on our toes and it has to come from our schools graduating these future leaders of our country 

432.40 436.93 B: i think i'm dominating this conversation too much [laughter] 

434.94 436.97 A: [mn] [noise] hm no i r- i 

437.21 442.40 A: i i'm a journalist by trade i i'm paid to listen more than anything else so 

442.76 447.47 A: i actually find it fascinating to hear about other public schools
