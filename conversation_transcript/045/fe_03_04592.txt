248.27 255.64 A: yeah yeah um actually that's we don't even have the d._v._d. either it's we've got so many you know regular movies it's 

255.75 268.79 A: you know it's so hard because like people are buying all these d._v._d.s and it's like you've gotta buy the d._v._d. and then all of a sudden okay what happened to the v._c._r. you know it's like you've got all the video tapes and you can't even watch them because you know they have the d._v._d.s or whatever 

263.76 264.97 B: (( [laughter] ))
