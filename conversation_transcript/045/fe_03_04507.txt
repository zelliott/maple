0.16 2.82 B: hi this is brook from williamsburg 

2.27 4.81 A: yes hi this is jim in l._a. 

5.23 6.59 B: how are you tonight 

6.05 7.31 A: good how are you 

6.88 11.24 B: pretty good i guess it's not tonight really for you guys is it 

10.64 13.37 A: ah it's seven o'clock 

12.69 13.92 B: [laughter] 

14.28 15.99 B: (( it's much later here )) 

15.67 16.75 A: right 

17.20 18.44 A: so 

19.44 20.82 A: how do we begin 

20.70 25.62 B: well i guess my first thought when i heard the question was um 

25.65 28.12 B: of the pay that teachers receive 

27.88 29.80 A: that's a good point 

29.21 39.23 B: and i think that that has a lot to do with our school system and if they were paid better they probably i mean there are a lot of great teachers out there don't get me wrong 

33.57 35.63 A: right 

39.43 40.41 B: but 

40.75 44.47 B: you know the pay should certainly have something to do with performance [noise] 

45.12 57.57 A: right and the good teachers that are out there are [sigh] the type of people who are doing it in spite of not making any money and right but those are few and far between 

52.72 55.55 B: exactly they're doing it because they want to do it 

58.03 69.48 A: um i lived in new york for many many years most of my adult life and no one who has children in new york who can afford to 

69.55 72.52 A: sends their kids to public school in new york 

72.51 74.29 A: and it 

74.15 79.49 A: there've been so many there were so many articles that i read over the years about that and basically 

79.49 89.65 A: what it what the public school systems in most of the big cities to me it seems like they've just deteriorated to the point of being a babysitting service 

90.13 91.05 A: you know 

90.84 93.20 B: yeah it seems like that they just 

92.24 101.66 A: yeah you know that it's something to keep the kids um something to keep the kids occupied and 

101.83 106.10 A: [sigh] um something to 

106.25 112.39 A: get the kids you know out of the parents' responsibility for those amount of hours and almost just like 

112.46 121.88 A: keeping to the law you know because the law is that a child has to go to school but ah you know up to a certain age but it's ah it's really a shame 

117.18 118.53 B: (( right [noise] )) 

122.60 133.08 A: um one of the other things that i'm i was always very concerned about was the with with the lower budgets that exist now the first thing to always go is 

133.90 138.41 A: art and cultural education within the schools and when i was 

138.52 142.73 A: a kid in public schools and it was in the 

143.48 146.03 A: ah late fifties through 

146.64 151.40 A: i guess the late sixties that i was in public schools um 

151.87 160.42 A: once a week there was an art class once a week there was a music class you know there were things like that that doesn't exist in public schools anymore 

160.65 161.72 A: anywhere 

161.70 163.41 B: i think it does in some 

164.23 167.94 B: um it seems to i tutor 

167.99 169.34 A: oh yeah 

168.53 181.14 B: in the area and it seems that that some of the kids in this area now this is a much more affluent area i'm in williamsburg virginia i don't know if you're real familiar with 

176.90 177.98 A: uh-huh 

181.51 183.94 A: well i've never been to that part of the world but 

185.06 186.07 A: um 

185.40 191.94 B: but we're we're a somewhat more affluent area i mean people tend to move here to retire 

187.58 189.90 A: upscale yeah 

192.15 193.24 B: um 

193.28 197.08 B: it's a touristy area but it the people who actually live here 

197.26 199.12 B: tend to make more money 

198.67 199.69 A: uh-huh 

199.94 201.33 B: and um 

202.13 205.83 B: it's a big golf area which which i think pulls a lot of 

205.11 208.49 A: [cough] yeah right 

205.92 207.19 B: higher income 

208.10 212.47 B: and i don't know if that has a lot to do with it i mean it should be 

212.78 214.93 B: that the state schools are pretty 

216.05 220.35 B: normal i mean pretty you know standard without the state 

220.99 222.27 B: (( but ah )) 

222.35 227.08 B: it seems like schools are better in in this area 

225.86 235.37 A: well yeah whenever the yeah of course in in the better neighborhoods there are better schools it's kind of an ironic situation i mean it's like that all over the country where i am here in in 

235.33 243.35 A: the part of l._a. that i'm in here that i'm in now is also a better upscale neighborhood it's um 

240.97 242.53 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

243.68 253.14 A: it's it's malibu you've everyone's heard of malibu right and it's very beautiful and there's the mountains overlooking you know the mountains that go right down 

243.88 245.15 B: [noise] 

246.96 248.21 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

253.04 261.31 A: the cliffs to the beach and people either live up in the hills or they live on the beach and it's very beautiful and it's very upscale and the 

261.71 269.27 A: you know the median income here is much higher than it is in most parts of the world most parts of the country certainly 

262.35 263.50 B: [noise] 

269.18 279.20 A: um and the public schools are very good now what happens is when you get when you get affluent people you get people who number first of all that the the the tax 

279.19 291.37 A: they pay more in taxes and they're more concerned so they're involved with the public schools and when when the money is there you can get the good teachers and you can get the good programs you know 

290.34 295.60 B: [noise] and i think i think it comes a lot less from money than it does from 

296.07 297.28 B: a and this is 

297.59 304.56 B: my guess because oh the state is funding m- most of the schools more than you know say the county or the city 

303.97 306.62 A: right yeah that's true the bulk of 

305.27 311.17 B: so i think it probably comes a lot from demand that you know when you have a higher income 

311.36 312.09 B: and h- 

312.19 318.39 B: usually that comes with higher education then you're you know what can be demanded of your public school 

313.68 315.53 A: (( it right )) 

318.36 320.49 A: right 

319.96 323.29 B: and i wonder if if that has a lot to do with it because 

322.37 327.50 A: that's like an old catch twenty two that's true and that is if you don't 

327.40 339.14 A: if you've never been exposed to something that's positive you don't expect it because you don't know what it is and if you don't expect it you certainly won't demand it 

334.73 335.74 B: right 

338.89 340.25 B: exactly 

340.12 351.80 A: um and you made a very good point that the money does mostly come from the state doesn't it i mean a little of it comes from the local municipalities but most of it does come from the state you're absolutely right yeah 

348.80 350.50 B: [noise] yeah with 

350.57 362.08 B: with and that's why i'm always surprised that you know people will say oh well i want to go you know the closest city is newport news and or norfolk which i'm sure you've heard of norfolk 

361.34 362.29 A: uh-huh 

362.15 367.92 B: um and people will always say oh i'd much rather my kids go to school in williamsburg than in newport news or norfolk 

367.42 368.39 A: uh-huh 

368.18 375.87 B: but that makes no sense to me the only reason i can see that people would rather their kids go here is because of the types of people they'll be surrounded by 

375.60 376.67 A: uh-huh 

376.04 377.45 B: not because 

377.47 382.13 B: there's more money going into the school not because there's better teachers 

382.78 383.93 A: mhm 

383.18 389.66 B: that's all i really can see that that a difference would be because the same money's going into the schools there than it is here 

388.51 400.68 A: right but when you say they'd rather be surrounded by those people b- y- probably what you mean are those people have high like you said higher degree higher income higher degrees of education 

400.46 413.62 A: a more a more pleasant environment a more upscale community so you know money education comes with money money buys education even if it's a public school the irony is that 

402.96 404.09 B: exactly 

413.56 418.52 A: when every anywhere in the country i'm sure when you go into a more affluent neighborhood 

418.78 423.55 A: you have better public schools and those are exactly the neighborhoods where 

423.70 433.74 A: a larger percentage of the people either don't send their kids to public schools spend the money to send them to private schools or could afford to send them to private schools if they wanted to 

432.30 433.35 B: right 

433.52 443.63 A: and that's really a shame because where it's needed is where some is is in the areas where someone has has no money to send send a child to private school but they don't they don't know 

439.74 440.93 B: yeah [noise] 

444.53 448.65 A: [sigh] you know if if you've never um 

448.73 458.12 A: i don't know if you've never ah had something given to you you don't expect it you know and it's it's it's really a shame um 

458.17 462.45 A: the answer finally comes down to money but it but it i mean it comes down to w- 

462.49 464.21 A: i guess 

464.68 472.01 A: ev- all schools need a larger budget but participation is a good point you know um 

472.87 487.19 A: how do you get parents interested in having a larger degree of participation in determining curriculum and in determining various programs and you know emphasis on 

487.25 491.90 A: s- s- specific areas that are more important to one to one 

492.03 500.29 A: part of the n- part of the country to another or one neighborhood to another if the parents never had it and don't know that it exists you know 

499.37 506.00 B: [noise] [noise] well and i think sadly in another form that comes down to money as well not just if they never had it 

506.04 507.38 B: but 

507.65 513.75 B: people who have more money are more likely to have stay at home moms who have the time 

511.80 512.76 A: right 

513.83 517.31 B: to go to school board meetings to go to p._t._a. 

516.90 518.72 A: right 

517.82 520.26 B: and have a say you know 

519.28 520.99 A: right 

520.42 524.87 B: other people who don't have a lot of money are working all the time they don't have time to do these things 

523.14 528.17 A: right right and they're happy that the kid is in school period 

527.41 528.35 B: (( right [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

528.12 539.69 A: as long as the child is in school not just for their own good but for the for the not just for the child's good but for the ad- for the parents' good like i said before it becomes a babysitting service you know 

539.48 545.91 A: i mean there've been statistics that i've read over the years in new york city that the average 

546.30 551.86 A: child who graduates from high school who's been from start to finish 

551.85 563.72 A: um you know from kindergarten through graduation of high school in new york city has something like an eighth grade reading level you know and that's really a shame so w- what happened d- during those 

558.73 559.97 B: wow 

563.92 566.61 A: nine ten eleven twelve what did they do 

566.64 567.61 A: you know 

567.50 571.01 B: i guess they just want them out of there because there's so many more coming in [noise] [noise] 

567.69 568.61 A: um 

569.98 576.06 A: yeah and and in new york it's it's an even larger problem because there's a system in 

575.95 589.98 A: in new york city there's a public university city college of new york i mean i i live here in l._a. but i u- like i said before i used to live in new york most of my adult life until recently i lived in new york so i just know about this from all those years there 

589.93 599.89 A: there's the city college of new york which is ah a university that's right in manhattan it's right in new york city and any child who
