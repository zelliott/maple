24.01 28.52 B: okay well that's nice to hear so do you want to start off or do you want me to 

28.44 29.58 A: ah you go 

29.34 36.30 B: okay um i think the question if there was if i thought anything was wrong with the public school systems 

36.39 40.26 B: and if so if they could anything could be changed or 

36.51 37.33 A: (( right mm )) 

40.52 48.75 B: um i think it really starts at the home you know within the family i i think it's how kids are being brought up today 

48.99 55.32 B: they're not um instilling um va- instilling values in you know what i'm saying in the home 

55.42 57.09 B: so um 

57.61 60.23 B: when they go to school then um 

60.38 61.66 B: am i making sense 

61.68 64.13 B: the [laughter] um i i 

61.98 63.01 A: (( yeah )) 

64.30 68.94 B: some of it i think it starts at the home i don't think it really has much to do with the schools mhm mhm 

69.83 76.27 A: i i have to agree with that but i also have to agree with the fact that i think teachers are more interested in salaries 

76.18 85.12 A: and more interested in um how long they've been doing this um what they can do to get out of the classroom how long it's going to be to r- till they retire 

85.06 92.79 A: um i think they're focusing more and more on those types of issues rather than teaching students things 

93.08 95.44 A: and i mean i went to 

95.30 109.06 A: it wasn't a large high school i'm not from a large city but um i went to a a fairly small high school and i can remember where there were certain teachers who took an interest in what they did and they really liked it and um 

109.86 116.59 A: i learned a lot from them i learned a lot from the people who got up every single day and taught and didn't open a book to teach 

116.63 125.83 A: um i didn't learn a lot from the people who opened a book and basically read paragraph after paragraph after paragraph to me um 

126.71 134.71 A: you know on certain topics on certain whatever it may be and but when i had the teachers that got up and and said you know um 

135.38 141.81 A: you know we're going to learn this and we're going to talk about this and we're going to go from here and and we actually had a class participation 

141.96 149.62 A: i i think i learned more that way i i think that people i think teachers are are just not interested in doing it because of the job market today they're like 

149.68 152.14 A: you know teaching is something that people fall back on 

152.68 154.20 B: right [mn] 

153.57 155.25 A: and you know 

155.39 159.88 B: i i agree somewhat um but i i do know a lot of teachers who um 

160.18 165.92 B: who really enjoy their profession like you were saying you know and they really care about 

165.97 168.92 B: um if they teach the kids something 

169.36 170.26 B: um 

170.37 174.33 B: so i think it has a lot to do with the family and then also um 

175.21 177.87 B: maybe somewhat in the school system 

177.89 179.95 B: i think i'm just rambling here 

180.64 181.68 B: (( um )) 

182.11 186.71 B: i know when i was in school i i graduated with a class of about three hundred and fifty 

186.67 187.68 A: mhm 

187.08 191.25 B: and um i wasn't an honors or anything but 

191.63 201.20 B: i know what you mean when when the teachers let the kids get away with things you know when they they're not really into teaching them teaching them um 

201.32 202.31 B: things 

203.06 207.83 B: i ha- i think that's something that could be um changed you know um 

208.17 213.97 B: just being more involved with the kids and being more involved with the lesson that they're trying to teach 

214.31 217.62 B: in that way um i think it could be improved 

217.75 222.44 A: right ah i totally agree with that too i i i i 

222.46 226.63 A: guess where i come from was i have a bachelors degree and 

226.70 239.21 A: you know i think i think when you're in high school and when you're in um [sigh] i guess this really just isn't a topic about high school huh but um i guess when you're in elementary school and you're in middle school i 

239.64 250.16 A: i i learned a lot more from and i learned a lot more about what i wanted to do in my life when i had those teachers that went that extra mile and tried to help me with things 

250.18 252.60 A: i learned very easily you know what i mean 

252.14 253.16 B: mhm 

253.13 257.56 A: and i i just think that if we focus more you know 

257.66 269.86 A: i think teachers should be required to go to um sabbaticals like doctors do and go to those types of things in order to keep learning continue education continue their um 

270.64 272.88 A: whatever you want to call it continue their 

272.91 285.36 A: knowledge on subjects continue their knowledge on topics on what to talk about their kids with they're not they're not they're not required at all to do that you know i've always thought that was a little bit weird but 

276.62 278.69 B: they're not required to do that 

278.90 280.15 B: they're not they're 

284.45 287.36 B: not i didn't know that i thought they were 

288.68 290.25 B: maybe not [noise] 

290.41 297.00 A: no i mean i i don't bel- i know they are required to go to certain seminars on like laws 

297.08 308.44 A: and you know what you can and can't say to your children and what you can and can't say to um parents and you know those types of things but i don't really know what else they're required to do 

308.38 309.86 B: (( [noise] right )) 

308.86 309.66 A: (( you know )) 

310.17 312.71 B: so do y- how do you think it could be changed 

313.28 314.64 A: um [sigh] 

315.30 320.19 A: i i think like i said i i think going to the types of things like um 

322.93 336.85 A: like the sabbaticals a- y- trying to learn um maybe having p- the professionals of the school do the exact same things and sit down with their staff and their faculty and talk about topics of of 

324.66 325.84 B: (( right mhm )) 

336.75 343.72 A: you know learning talk about um you know this is what we're going after you know we're going to promote this and um 

343.74 344.95 A: raise 

345.14 346.50 A: the um 

347.73 349.58 A: (( i can't even think what it's called )) 

350.46 354.66 A: i i think a lot to do with of i i think generally a lot to do with 

354.71 355.65 A: um 

358.21 367.47 A: how students do as far as passing or failing the class has a lot to do with morale and so if a teacher comes in every single day and she's like this is just a job i really don't want to be here blah blah blah blah blah 

367.28 373.61 A: you know then that her morale is going to carry over to her students and they're not going to want to succeed they're not going to care about that class 

373.96 375.05 B: right 

374.37 379.76 A: and so i think that should also be promoted but you know i'm just rambling too i don't know 

379.31 382.31 B: [laughter] do you mind me asking what you're um 

382.37 383.81 B: what your major is 

383.78 385.36 A: biomedical plants 

385.46 388.04 B: okay and you you live in corpus you said 

387.90 388.77 A: yeah 

388.14 389.66 B: what school are you going to 

389.91 393.42 A: um i've already graduated i went to u._t._s._a. in san antonio 

393.14 395.00 B: (( oh okay mhm mhm )) 

394.13 395.59 A: yeah and um 

395.81 405.73 A: i currently work as a chemist for an environmental lab and and i think a lot of that relates back to when i was younger you know when i was in middle school and i was in high school um 

405.88 407.63 A: i started um 

408.59 413.21 A: i started really really liking science about 

414.17 416.11 A: the sixth grade i guess 

416.51 420.37 A: and i had a lot of fun with it i mean i really really liked it i loved 

420.67 428.35 A: everything about science from the time that i was like fifth or sixth grade until i graduated and then when i went off to college i was you know standing back and going 

428.23 437.72 A: what am i going to do with my life i really don't know what i want to do there's nothing that i like and you know ou- and and relating to things that i remembered about school i was like you know 

438.40 443.22 A: i really really like science and so i'm going to try to relate to that and so 

443.35 446.78 A: i started it and i love it i absolutely love it 

446.01 457.62 B: mhm well that's good because i think that's why i didn't finish college because i never found what i wanted to do and i still don't but right now i mean i have a family and i'm raising a baby a newborn 

457.54 469.17 B: and i'm staying home um keeping him so i'm not working or anything but i want to eventually go back to school but i don't know what i want to do and i have no clues still so i you know 

469.25 470.71 B: that's what's hard 

471.05 471.70 A: right 

472.50 474.63 A: what did you do before you had your baby 

474.46 477.20 B: i was working for pier one at the home office 

477.48 478.53 A: oh how cool 

478.58 480.94 B: (( yeah in sales um )) 

481.78 488.39 B: and i never thought that would be a permanent job you know maybe move up into different departments 

488.77 489.78 B: um 

490.07 494.21 B: but still i i didn't know what i wanted to do and that's really 

494.28 500.23 B: bothered me you know and i don't know how to go in finding out what i want to do in college or 

500.31 502.04 B: what i want to study you know 

502.01 507.17 A: you know what i usually tell people is a really good friend of mine is going through college right now and he's also going to u._t. 

507.46 521.32 A: and we spend a lot of time together and we talk about things and he has absolutely no interest in anything that went on in high school that goes on in college he has no interest in any subjects he's like you know i really don't know what i want to do 

517.64 519.24 B: mhm 

521.76 534.16 A: and you know my grandfather told me a long long time ago that pe- there's two types of people there are people who are money driven and there are people who do what they like to do and usually they do not go hand in hand and i am the first one to tell you that is true 

533.94 535.53 B: [laughter] 

534.84 538.42 A: because i do what i like to do but i don't make anywhere near 

538.18 552.65 A: what i would do if i had a bachelors degree in human resource management or retail marketing or you know i don't make anywhere near that and i think the reason that that that happened i mean is exactly w- what what he told me 

542.78 543.69 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

552.66 554.93 A: you know you either do what you love or you do 

555.43 556.79 A: what um 

557.09 565.84 A: you know or you're money driven or you know whatever well i don't want to make a hundred thousand dollars a year i mean i would love to do that but unfortunately in my field that'll never happen 

566.81 574.97 A: and so i'm kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place there because i'm stuck in my little you know low paying job but eventually i'll probably get to where i need to be 

574.42 575.42 B: mhm 

575.16 576.20 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

575.87 581.38 B: well biomedical science sounds like you should be making enough in the end or you know 

581.60 592.35 A: yeah it's basically i was going to be a doctor and that's really really what i wanted to be um after four years of college um i did a lot of double credit stuff when i was still in high school 

592.32 598.68 A: and after my fourth year in college and i graduated i was like you know i think i'm going to take a year off well that year turned into four 

598.41 599.44 B: mhm 

599.23 599.89 A: and
